Analytical Modeling of the White Light Fringe

Slava G. Turyshev

Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109

We developed analytical technique for extracting the phase, visibility and am-

plitude information as needed for interferometric astrometry with the Space

Interferometry Mission (SIM). Our model accounts for a number of physical

and instrumental eﬀects, and is valid for a general case of bandpass ﬁlter. We

were able to obtain general solution for polychromatic phasors and address

properties of unbiased fringe estimators in the presence of noise. For demon-

stration purposes we studied the case of rectangular bandpass ﬁlter with two

diﬀerent methods of optical path diﬀerence (OPD) modulation – stepping and

ramping OPD modulations. A number of areas of further studies relevant to

instrument design and simulations are outlined and discussed.

Introduction

SIM is designed as a space-based 10-m baseline Michelson optical interferometer oper-

ating in the visible waveband (see Ref. 1 for more details). This mission will open up

many areas of astrophysics, via astrometry with unprecedented accuracy. Thus, over

a narrow ﬁeld of view SIM is expected to achieve mission accuracy of 1 µas. In this

1

mode SIM will search for planetary companions to nearby stars by detecting the as-

trometric “wobble” relative to a nearby (

1◦) reference star. In its wide-angle mode,

≤

SIM will be capable to provide a 4 µas precision absolute position measurements of

stars, with parallaxes to comparable accuracy, at the end of a 5-year mission. The

expected proper motion accuracy is around 3 µas/yr, corresponding to a transverse

velocity of 10 m/s at a distance of 1 kpc.

The SIM instrument does not directly measure the angular separation between

stars, but the projection of each star direction vector onto the interferometer baseline

by measuring the pathlength delay of starlight as it passes through the two arms

of the interferometer. The delay measurement is made by a combination of internal

metrology measurements to determine the distance the starlight travels through each

arm, external metrology measurements that determine the length and local orienta-

tion of the baseline, and a measurement of the central white light fringe to determine

the point of equal optical pathlength (see Figure 1).

The primary motivation for the work was the idea to use the averaged and bias-

corrected complex phasors to estimate the external optical pathlength diﬀerence for

the incoming polychromatic light. This approach is applicable to the science interfer-

ometer phase measurement, for which it is not necessary to remove the bias from each

estimate, just as long as it is removed from the averaged estimate. This method was

applied in Ref. 2 to obtain unbiased fringe visibility estimates. Under certain condi-

tions (dc intensity values and visibilities approximately constant during integration

time) this method allows to use the average values of the phasors for estimating the

average phase ¯φ (see discussion in Refs. 3, 4). A deﬁnition for the complex visibility

phasors is stemming from the form of a complex visibility function, ˜V = vejφ, where

v is the visibility and φ is its phase. Decomposing this expression onto real and imag-

inary parts as ˜V = X + jY , one obtains the complex visibility phasors, X = v cos φ

and Y = v sin φ. SIM will be able to eﬀectively determine both visibility and phase

of the fringe, but for the astrometric purposes the phase must be determined to a

much higher accuracy. (The most stringent SIM requirement in this regard is the

average phase error over 30 s integration time corresponds to a path-length error of

approximately 30 pm.) Phase determination in the presence of noise is a non-linear

estimation process. Even in the monochromatic case it requires careful approach to

E 1

3

averaging and correcting for biases in the data. Most of the algorithms for phase-

shifting interferometry are designed for monochromatic light, and there is typically

a match between the stroke of the modulating element and the wavelength of the

light (see, for example, Refs. 5 for a discussion of various algorithms). However, be-

cause SIM uses a dispersed fringe technique, this match cannot be maintained over

multiple channels. A number of modiﬁcations to the existing four-bucket algorithms

were designed to address speciﬁc problems relating to Palomar Testbed Interferome-

ter (PTI)6 and the Keck Interferometer. Also, there is nothing inherent that requires

the match between wavelength and stroke, nevertheless most analysis has been based

on this assumption. It was shown in Ref. 4 that at low light levels, most of these algo-

rithms become biased when there is a mismatch. The magnitude of this bias is quite

signiﬁcant with respect to the instrument requirements, thus making these algorithms

unacceptable for SIM.

This paper discusses analytic model developed for the white light fringe data

extraction. Our goal here is to establish functional dependency of the white light

fringe parameters on the properties of incoming light as well as the instrumental

input parameters. We will show that this approach is applicable for establishing the

unbiased estimators for the case with low light levels. This method enables on to

analytically analyze the noise propagation properties. The importance of this feature

comes from the fact that integration time on stellar targets accounts for a signiﬁcant

portion of the mission time and can be reduced by the use of processing techniques

with reduced error variance (see Refs.7-10 for more details). The analytical from of the

fringe parameters may be helpful in studying diﬀerent properties of the instruments,

4

especially their contribution to the accuracy of astrometric delay measured by SIM

science interferometer.11, 12

The problem of interference of electromagnetic radiation is well studied and ex-

tensive number of publications on this subject (speciﬁcally related to stellar interfer-

ometry) are available (see Refs. 10,13-19 and references therein). However, because of

complexity of this problem in a general case of polychromatic light, most of the current

research is done numerically. While numerical studies have proven to be extremely

valuable in analyzing the interference patterns and are very useful in addressing var-

ious instrumental eﬀects, the analytical methods provide the much needed critical

understanding of the white light interference phenomena. It will be demonstrated be-

low that analytic solution may be used as a tool to study the complex interferometric

phenomena on a principally diﬀerent qualitative level.3

In this paper we derive analytic model that may be used to describe photo-

electron detection process. We analytically describe the physical and instrumental

processes that are important in estimating the fringe parameters (i.e. intensity of

incoming radiation, its visibility and the phase of the fringe). Eﬀects that are not

included in the model are due to polarization of both incoming light and the instru-

mental throughput, eﬀect of the wavefront-tilt, low frequency vibrations, drifts, jitter,

etc. Consideration the size of this paper, we plan to address these issues elsewhere.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 1 we review the description of inter-

ferometric pattern in the case of monochromatic radiation. In Section 2 we develop a

model for the interferometric pattern registered by a CCD detector in the polychro-

matic case. Our model accounts for the eﬀects of the instrumental throughput, beam

5

splitter and quantum eﬃciency of the CCD. We also discuss the spectral channels

with narrow bands designed to ﬁlter the polychromatic light. In Section 3 we intro-

duce parameterization for the polychromatic fringe pattern and deﬁne the quantities

that are forming the astrometric signal on the CCD. Speciﬁcally, we derive solution

for the white light fringe equation in the general case. In Section 4 we present general

analytic solution for complex visibility phasors and will discuss a noise suppression

approach. In Section 5 we develop technique for studying the case of a rectangu-

lar bandpass ﬁlter. We also obtain functional dependency of our solution in the two

cases of OPD modulation, namely the stepping and ramping modulations. In Section

6 we present conclusions and recommendations for future studies of accurate fringe

reconstruction. In order to make access of the basic results of this paper easier, we

will present some important calculations in the Appendices. Thus, in Appendix A we

discuss two possible deﬁnitions for the fringe phase and justify the choice we made in

the paper. In Appendix B we develop approximation for the complex fringe envelope

function. In Appendix C we present a general solution for the instrumental contribu-

tion aﬀecting the fringe parameters in the case of the rectangular bandpass ﬁlter and

stepping OPD modulation.

1. Monochromatic Fringe Pattern

The problem of interference of a monochromatic radiation presently is well studied

(see Ref.13 and references therein). Here we would like to review information that

will be necessary for discussion of the fringe phase extraction process.

We assume that a plane electromagnetic wave, ~E, which is coming from inﬁnity

6

simultaneously on the two arms of an interferometer, has the following form:

~E = ~E0ej

ωt−~k·~x

,

(1)

(cid:0)
with ~E0 is a constant vector. We will be using a nomenclature where a wavenumber k

(cid:1)

relates to the wavelength as follows k = 2π

λ . After passing through the interferometer,

the two beams ~E1 and ~E2, are combined at the detector to produce interferomet-

ric pattern (see Figure 1). The corresponding fringe pattern is due to the coherent

addition of the two light-beams, ~E = ~E1 + ~E2, and it may be expressed as follows:

quantity. The ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand side of this equation are constant

intensities of light in the two beams,

I1 = ~E2
the interferometric pattern which, in ideal situation, depends only on the optical

The factor

2I0. Therefore,

visibility reduces simply to one, V = 1.

A. Fringe Modulation

As seen in Figure 2 monochromatic pattern is a simple one. In practice, the studied

source may be interferometrically resolved, thus leading to a reduced visibility V

= 1.

Moreover, the visibility V , the constant phase diﬀerence φ0 and the constant intensity

I0 are generally not known. To ﬁnd them one modulates the phase diﬀerence with
some known function, say x(t), as below:

(k, t) =

where eﬀect of the beam splitter (which is true for a Michelson stellar interferometer)

brings additional π

The primary goal here is to determine the phase φ0 by modulating the internal

optical path diﬀerence x(t). By doing so, one ﬁnds the exact value of internal delay

xint = x(t′) that would exactly compensate the initial oﬀset or k(d0 −
having determined the external delay d0 = xint one can determine the source position

from equation d0 = (~b

~s), where ~b is the interferometer baseline vector and ~s is the

·

source position on the sky. In practice, this is done in a global astrometric solutions

discussed in details in Refs.11, 12 and not addressed here.

As shown in the Figures 3 and 4 there may be diﬀerent ways of modulating

the internal OPD in an interferometer. In particular, Figure 3 demonstrates the case

when the OPD is modulated linearly. Thus, the upper plot shows a typical phase

weighted, noise optimized solution to this set of equations in more details in Section

4, while dealing with a more complicated case of the polychromatic light.

When dealing with a polychromatic light content in the wide bandwidth, one

either i) forms a light with a narrow spectral width, such that eﬀects of polychromacity

(discussed further) are negligible, or ii) disperses the light beam on a large number

of spectral channels, such that monochromatic approximation is valid within each

channel.16 As a result, most of the current algorithms and simulations for stellar

optical interferometry are based on the properties of the monochromatic light. This

is a good approximation for some of existing testbed conﬁgurations that use as many

as 80 spectral channels for dispersed light. Nominally the SIM ﬂight system will use

four to eight channels for guide interferometers. Because of the large bandwidth of

each channel (87.5 nm), the quasi-monochromatic assumptions are not valid, and

modiﬁcations to the algorithms are necessary.4, 19 In the following Section we will

introduce a method designed to address this issue.

2. Modeling Observables for a Polychromatic Fringe

The observational conditions in the case of polychromatic light are signiﬁcantly al-

tered compare to the simplicity of the monochromatic situation discussed in Section

1. Thus, Figure 5 shows a general behavior of harmonic signals with a diﬀerent fre-

quencies. The left plot in the ﬁgure shows three sinusoidal monochromatic waves with

the same initial phase oﬀset φ0 = π/5. Depending on the wavenumber, each wave,

as a function of OPD, produces diﬀerent fringe pattern. Note that a combination of

these three waves (a simple model of a polychromatic fringe) also produces a har-

13

monic signal, but its shape is drastically diﬀerent from the initial one (shown on the

right plot). For the expected SIM ﬁnite bandwidth the wavenumbers of the interfering

light may be diﬀerent as much as twice from each other (i.e. the SIM wavenumber

bandwidth is k

[450, 950] nm). Thus, in general, only at zero OPD (i.e. for the

∈

white light fringe) the interferometric pattern would have maximum intensity.

In this Section we will derive an equation to describe the interference pattern of

a polychromatic fringe as needed for the SIM CCD detector read-out.

A. Modeling Observables in the Wide Bandwidth Case

As was mentioned earlier, the case of describing interferometric pattern that involves

a ﬁnite bandwidth - is a more complicated one. In general all the quantities involved

are complicated functions of a wavenumber. Note that, contrary to the Eq. (1), not

only the phase of the electromagnetic wave depend on time and wavelength, but the

same true on it’s amplitude

~E(k, t) = ~E0(k, t)ej (ωt−kx),

(7)

with ~E0 being the wave’s amplitude vector that depends both on the wavelength and

time. This expression shows a wave-packet that describes individual contribution to

the polychromatic light that is due to a particular monochromatic constituent of it.

A way to describe this process is to collect all constituents of polychromatic light

at diﬀerent wavelengths that are present in the incoming electromagnetic wave. It

is convenient to express the intensity of the polychromatic radiation as a coherent

addition of the individual wave-packets (1) with a diﬀerent frequencies.13 Denoting

B. Eﬀect of a Beam Splitter

To complete the formulation of our model we need to account for yet one more

element that is of crucial importance for a Michelson stellar interferometer - the

beam splitter.6, 9 It is well-known that one of the ﬁgures of merit when considering

various beam splitter designs for the astrometric beam combiner, is the variation of

phase as a function of wavelength between the interfering beams at zero OPD. Thus,

ideally, one would like zero phase diﬀerence for all wavelengths at zero OPD since

this would produce a fringe maximum simultaneously at all wavelengths (or fringe

minimum for a Michelson stellar interferometer). Another desirable case is one in

which the phase diﬀerence varies linearly with frequency. In this case one can still

achieve a simultaneous fringe maximum at all wavelengths; however, for this case

there is a constant correction that must be applied to the calculated external delay.3

This eﬀect is important because it may produce a signiﬁcant contribution to the

OPD. We may include this eﬀect in a most general way — the wavenumber dependent

function f (k) added to the desirable π/2 eﬀect of an ideal beam splitter. Thus, the

total eﬀect of the beam splitter may be modeled as

δΦbs(k) =

+ f (k),

(17)

where f (k) is a slow varying function of a wavenumber. This function may be ap-

π
2

18

proximated up to the second order around some central frequency of bandpass (the

whole 80 channels pass), kc, as

f (k) = f (kc) + f ′(kc)(k

kc) +

f ′′(kc)(k

kc)2 +

−

(∆k3

c ).

O

−

(18)

It may be shown3 that function f (kc) will have a direct impact on the phase accuracy

estimation by shifting the phase by a constant value. In addition, the function f ′(kc)

will change the envelope function and, in general, will produce a non-linear contribu-

tion to the phase. f ′′(kc) will have impact on both - linear contribution to the phase

and the non-linear one; ﬁrst it comes as a correction to the envelope function and

then to the phase. Even though, the magnitude of the eﬀects of f ′′ is smallest among

all, the parameters f, f ′, f ′′ are all of importance. The corresponding eﬀects may be

well modeled, depending on the optical properties of the beam splitter, but the ﬁnal

answer would come probably form calibration.

Finally, without loosing generality, the eﬀect of beam splitter may be accounted

for as an additional phase shift to the argument besides the usual δΦbs(k) = π

2 and,

thus leading to a new deﬁnition for the fringe phase φ(k) in the form

Φ(k)

Φ(k) + δΦbs(k) = Φ(k) +

+ f (k) =

+ φ(k).

C. Detector’s Photo-electron Counts

A CCD detector is responding a quantity that is closely related to the intensity of

radiation, namely the incoming energy which is given as d

(k, t) = d

(k, t)dt, or

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:17)

where

F0(k) is a dimensionless factor representing the total instrumental through-
put.4, 19 Usually a detector is optimized to work at a certain wavelengths better then

at the others. This property may be qualitatively described by, so called, the quan-

tum eﬃciency of a detector, α(k). Thus, the quantum eﬃciency of a CCD detector is

conventionally deﬁned as

(k, t) = α(k)

(k, t), therefore the density of the emitted

N

E

photo-electrons per a unit area may be presented by the following expression:

d

N

(k, t) = α(k)

(22)

(cid:16)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:17)

Note that quantum eﬃciency of the detector is a function of a wavelength α(k). This

dependency will not addressed in the present study, but will be explored elsewhere.

The total number of photo-electron counts, N, depends on the collective area of

the detector in accord dN(k, t) =

(k, t)dA. Note that the total photon count is a

N

function of power of radiation approaching the detector which is given as d

(k, t) =

(k, t)dA. Therefore, one obtains

(cid:0)

·

(cid:1)(cid:17)

where ~n is the direction of the wave falling on the detector and ~dA = dA ~τA is the vec-

tor of the collective area of the detector. Integration of this equation over the collective

area depends on the properties of the experimental setup, notably on the orientation

20

of the collective area with respect to incoming light. Thus, a small geometric mis-

alignment in the system may be responsible for the uneven illumination of diﬀerent

pixels on the detector. Additionally, the wavefront tilt may produce a measurable

contribution to the fringe parameters estimated with the help of Eq. (23).

In Section 5 we will introduce a concept of a ﬁltered polychromatic light for which

notation dAℓ will be designated for the collective area of the ℓ-th spectral channel

(or area of illumination on the detector designated for a particular spectral channel).

Assuming that this area is small, and neglecting divergence of the radiation in the

instrument, we may integrate Eq. (23) over dAℓ. Note, that this operation, together

with the quantum eﬃciency of the detector, mathematically may be “folded” into

the deﬁnition for the bandpass ﬁlter (also discussed Section 5). Therefore, we can

designate to the ﬁlter not only the function of control over the allowed band-pass

of incoming radiation, but also it can produce masking of the detector by allowing

exposure of only a certain areas of it. Note that we ignore the eﬀects of the wavefront

tilt and uneven illumination of diﬀerent pixels on the detector, and defer the discussion

of these issues to a subsequent publication.

Assumptions above result in the following expression for the density of the photon-

counts registered by the detector:

N(k, t) =

(24)

(cid:16)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:17)

where we corrected the total instrumental throughput for the quantum eﬃciency of

(k) = α(k)

the detector,

F0(k). (This form of the notation is quite suﬃcient for the
error propagation and sensitivity analyses that we will report elsewhere.) Therefore,

F

21

we derived a model for the interferometric fringe pattern that accounts for a number of

eﬀects of light propagating through the instrument. In the next Section we will derive

observational equation to be used for estimating the fringe parameters if interest.

3. Parameterization of a Polychromatic Fringe Pattern

As we see from the previous discussion, description of the interferometric pattern in

the polychromatic case that involves a ﬁnite bandwidth of radiation - is a technically

complicated task. Thus, the observational conditions in the case of polychromatic light

are signiﬁcantly altered compare to the simplicity of the monochromatic process. In

general, all the quantities involved are complicated functions of the wavelength. In the

previous Sections, we choose a way to describe this process is to collect contributions

of all inﬁnitesimal constituents of polychromatic light at diﬀerent wavelengths within

the bandwidth of the incoming electromagnetic radiation.3

The total number of photo-electron counts, N, registered by a CCD detector per

wavenumber and per unit time, may be given by the following expression:

dN(k, t) =

(k)

I0(k)

F

1 + V (k) sin

φ(k) + kx(t)

dk dt,

(25)

(cid:16)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:17)

where

put;4, 19

(k) is a dimensionless factor representing the total instrumental through-

F
I0(k), V (k) and φ(k) are the spectral density of photon ﬂux, visibility and
phase of the incoming light; x(t) is modulated internal delay. We are using a nomen-

clature where a wavenumber k relates to the wavelength as follows k = 2π

λ . We also

accounted for the nominal π

2 phase shift due to the SIM beam splitter, which produces

a sine fringe rather than a cosine one.

22

Note that the total instrumental throughput depends on a number of other fac-

tors, some of these are the collective area of the detector, quantum eﬃciency of CCD,

and overall spectral response of the instrument (as discussed in Section 2C). Our goal

here is to derive observational equation that may be used to estimate the apparent

fringe phase and visibility. To estimate the true source visibility and phase one would

have to perform a set of additional calibration and estimation procedures that will

be addressed elsewhere.

A.

Integration Over the Spectral Bandwidth

In this Section we will perform integrations of Eq. (25) over wavenumber space and

time, that are necessary to derive analytical model. This model will be used further

for the purposes of the fringe parameters estimation.

Let us ﬁrst perform integration over the SIM wavenumber bandwidth k

[k−

SIM, k+

SIM],

∈

where k−

SIM = 450 nm is the beginning of the SIM bandwidth, and k+

SIM = 950 nm is

the end of this bandwidth, thus k

[450, 950] nm. A formal integration of Eq.(25)

over dk leads to the following result

−

In the case of channeled (or dispersed) spectrum output, the integration of this equa-

tion over the range of wavenumbers is straightforward. For this purpose, we designate

index, ℓ, to denote a particular spectral channel. Suppose that there exists a total of

L spectral channels, thus ℓ

[1, ..., L].

∈

Our deﬁnition for the spectral channel ℓ implies the width of the channel ∆kℓ =

k+
ℓ −

k−
ℓ and existence of a “central” wavenumber kℓ within this channel. We also,

23

assume continuous spectrum within the bandwidth, so that there is no gaps exist in

the interval k

[k−

SIM, k+

SIM]. A consequence of this is the equality k−

ℓ+1 = k+

ℓ , which

leads to the following discrete representation of the bandwidth ∆kSIM =

These assumptions allow us to rewrite the right-hand side of Eq. (26) as follows:

(cid:3)(cid:17)

This equation is our ﬁrst important result. It will help to focus our attention from the

discussion of coherent processes within the whole wide bandwidth, onto addressing

this processes on a smaller scale – within a particular narrow spectral channel, ℓ.

B. Deﬁnitions for the Fringe Parameters

At this point, it is convenient to introduce a set of useful notations. First of all, we

deﬁne the average total intensity of incoming electromagnetic radiation,

the ℓ-th spectral channel as

I0ℓ =

1
∆kℓ Z

k+
ℓ

F

k−

These new notations allow to present Eq. (28) as given below

In the next Section we will deﬁne the fringe visibility, phase and mean wavenumber.

C. Fringe Visibility, Mean Wavenumber and Phase

To further simplify the obtained equation, we will introduce functional form the fringe

visibility, the phase and the wavenumber notations. Thus, the fringe visibility, V0ℓ,

within the ℓ-th channel is given as

1
∆kℓ Z
Similarly to Eq. (30) we denote normalized visibility in the channel as

k+
ℓ
ˆ
I0ℓ(k)V (k)dk.

(33)

These deﬁnitions help us to re-write equation (31) in the following compact form

φ(k) + kx(t)

To deﬁne mean wavenumber, kℓ, and mean phase, φℓ, for the ℓ-th spectral channel

we will use the following expression:

kℓ =

k+

ˆ
I0ℓ(k) k dk

k−

(35)

There are two ways to deﬁne the phase within the channel. Thus, it is tempting to

deﬁne the mean phase as

φℓ =

k+
ℓ
ˆ
I0ℓ(k)φ(k)dk

≡

1
∆kℓ Z

k−
ℓ

1
I0ℓ∆kℓ Z

k+

F

k−
ℓ

(k)

I0(k)φ(k)dk.

(36)

This deﬁnition is acceptable for narrow spectral channel, however for a wide channel

one needs a more convenient form, namely

φ(kℓ),

which is

φ(kℓ)

= φℓ,

(37)

25

6
and is simply the phase value at the central wavenumber. In our further analysis we

will be using this latter deﬁnition. (The relationships between the two deﬁnitions for

the phase Eqs. (36) and (37) will be addressed in Appendix A).

The three introduced quantities (i.e. visibility, mean wavenumber kℓ and phase

at the mean wavenumber φ(kℓ)) allow to proceed with integration of Eq. (34).

D. Complex Fringe Envelope Function

Deﬁnitions introduced in the previous Section allow us to separate functions kℓ and

φ(kℓ) from the functions with direct dependency on the wavenumber k. As a result,

Eq. (34), for the total photon count, may be presented as below

I0(k)V (k) is symmetric, then ˜Wℓ is real valued, Ωℓ = 0, and only at zero delay,16 where

(k)

F

the envelope is at peak, is the true visibility observed.

E. Temporal Integration

The last integration to be performed in Eq.(25) (or equivalently Eq.(46)), is the integration

over time. The optical pathlength diﬀerence may be modulated either as a set of discrete

values corresponding to a number of steps in the OPD space (stepping OPD modulation)

or by ramping OPD over the range of values. The total integration time, ∆t, is the sum

of durations of eight temporal bins. (While our result is applicable for arbitrary number of

temporal bins, the SIM design will utilize 8 temporal bins):

obtains following expression for Nℓi:

To complete this integration, we assume that quantities

I0ℓ, V0ℓ, φ(kℓ), and kℓ do not
change with time during the photon-counting intervals. The only quantity that is

explicitly varies with time – is the optical pathlength diﬀerence x(t).

What makes the polychromatic case much more diﬃcult to study is that the

diﬀerent constituents of the ﬁnite bandwidth are not responding to the phase modu-

lation in the same way due to a short coherence length, as shown in Figures 6 and 7.

In particular, Figure 6 shows a typical interference pattern of the polychromatic light

that was composed as a superposition of a number of monochromatic constituents.

Also, in the upper plot of Figure 7 we show behavior of three monochromatic sinu-

soidal fringes plotted as functions of OPD. The OPD is modulated in equal steps over

a wavelength as shown in the upper plot of Figure 4. Note that largest wavenumber

(plotted by thin dashed line) produces the faster changing fringe amplitude. Moreover,

the polychromatic fringe composed from these three waves does not exactly repeats

the behavior of either of its constituents. As a result, one would need to minimize the

bandwidth ∆k in order to be able to describe the polychromatic phenomena.

The integration over time may be performed in a general form and corresponding

expression for the photon count, Nℓi, is given as follows:

Nℓi =

1 + V0ℓ sin φ(kℓ) Re

Fig. 7. Upper plot shows typical behavior of three monochromatic sinusoidal

fringes modulated in 8 equal steps over a wavelength (as shown in upper plot

of Figure 4). Parameters for the waves are given as φ = kix, φ0 = 0, with

k1 = 0.75k0 (thick dashed line), k2 = 0.8k0 (thin dashed line), k3 = 0.85k0

(thin solid line), thus the width of the spectral channel is ∆k = 0.1k0. Lower

The obtained result Eq. (51), (56) (or, equivalently Eq. (57)) constitutes the gen-

eral form of expression for the polychromatic fringe. We will use this result to ﬁnalize

the development of the general from of the observational model for polychromatic

case with arbitrary phase modulation.

Ideally, one would need to determine not only three quantities

I0ℓV0ℓ cos φ(kℓ),
I0ℓV0ℓ sin(kℓ), and
I0ℓ, but the full functional dependency of the original quantities.
However, the ﬁnite width of the observational band-width ∆kℓ complicates the es-

timation process by bringing the non-linearity in the observational equation via the

envelop function W . Note that if one neglects the size of the bandwidth ∆kℓ with

respect to the mean wavenumber kℓ or ∆kℓ/kℓ

0 (the envelop function becomes

→

32

unity W

1), one recovers the full simplicity of the monochromatic case represented

→

by Eq. (6).3

4. General Solution for Polychromatic Phasors With Noisy Data

Currently in use, there are two fringe estimators, one for visibility (the unbiased

estimator is V 2), and one for the phase (the unbiased estimator is the complex phasor).

The V 2 estimator is already worked out in much detail (i.e. Refs. 4,10-13) if the

complex phasor estimator is completed. So the development of the complex phasor

was the main purpose for the presented work. As it is known, the complex fringe

visibility can be represented by a phasor; if the fringe is stable, we can add the phasors

vectorially over multiple samples. This co-adding can provide an improved signal-to-

noise ratio. To co-add the fringe phasors requires a phase reference, for instance the

white light phase.7, 8

In this Section we will develop optimally-weighted solution that accounts for a

number of noise sources and will be applicable for a general case of delay modulation.

A. Fringe Equation for Noisy Data

For the purposes of clarity we will omit spectral index ℓ. All the obtained results are

valid for any channel and thus could be easily reconstructed, if needed.

In the case of noisy data, observations of photon-counts Ni are actually done

with errors and, in reality, we observe Ni = ¯Ni + ǫi, where ¯Ni is the value of photon

counts at the i-th temporal bin in the absence of noise and ǫi is a random variable,

representing the noise contribution to the measurements. We assume that ǫi are ran-

33

dom variables that are primarily due to gaussian statistics. (This approach may be

extended to incorporate other sources of noise.19 The corresponding results will be

reported elsewhere.) that are distributed around zero and following relations are valid

Ni = ¯Ni + ǫi,

E(ǫi) = 0,

E(ǫ2

i ) = σ2
i .

(58)

In the general case one must account not only for the Gaussian statistics of read-out

process, but also for the Poisson statistic that governs photo-emission (and photo-

counting) process. Thus, a correct approach would be to assume that ǫi is a sum of two

terms ǫi = µ ǫG

i +(1

µ) ǫP

i , where ǫG
i

is Gaussian and ǫP
i

is Poissonian variables and µ

−

is a number between 0 and 1. Expected complication arises from the fact that standard

deviation computed for the photon-counting Poissonian bias is actually proportional

to the signal (σP

i )2

¯
i (see discussion in Ref. 10). This issue is out of scope of the
I

∝

present paper and we will address this issue at a later time.

We also assume that Ni are independent, therefore, we may form a diagonal

covariance matrix for the quantities Ni (or equivalently for ǫi) with dispersions σ2

the diagonal:

diﬀerent gain matrix4 instead of optimally weighted least-squared matrix Eq. (59),

one may obtain solution with diﬀerent, speciﬁcally designed properties. Nevertheless,

our solution has enough embedded generality as it allows for arbitrary properties of

noise contribution, which will be further explored below.

duced by Eq.(62). To construct this matrix we will use the weights matrix Gy given

The obtained solution for the polychromatic visibility phasors given by Eq. (71) is

given in the form of a linear combination of weighted photon counts recorded during a

particular integration period. This form turned out to be very helpful when analyzing

contributions of CCD pixels that are systematically biased. The obtained result may

be used to de-weight ’bad’ pixels (in a statistical sense) and, thus, to reduce the

problem of biases while estimating fringe parameters.

This form allows to express an optimally-weighted solution for visibility, phase

5. Filtered Polychromatic Light: Spectral Channels with Narrow Bands

It is thought now that SIM will be operating at 80 spectral channels for the science

interferometer and at 4 channels for both guide interferometers. The data will be read

at a millisecond time rate. SIM will be dispersing light just before the interfering

radiation reaches the detector. To take this fact into account, we deﬁne a ﬁlter that

allows to limit the total bandwidth of the incoming radiation. We will formally denote

a ﬁlter with such a properties as follows:

ℓ(k) =

ℓ(k

kℓ; ∆kℓ).

F

F

−

(73)

We assumed that this ﬁlter operates within the ℓ-th spectral channel by allowing to

pass through only such a radiation that is composed from the frequencies correspond-

ing to the mean (or central) wavenumber kℓ within the bandwidth of ∆kℓ. Thus, ﬁlter

ℓ(k) enables the instrument to “see” light only in a certain interval ∆kℓ around the

F

mean number kℓ.

In this Section we will develop a model that employes such an approach for the

case of a rectangular bandpass ﬁlter. Due to its analytical simplicity, the rectangular

bandpass ﬁlter is the most known construction in the Fourier optics. This analysis

will allow us to establish correspondence with the previously obtained results both

for monochromatic and polychromatic light.

A. Rectangular Bandpass Filter

To take advantage of the results derived in the previous section, we must ﬁrst decide on

In the next two subsections we will study two diﬀerent special cases of OPD mod-

ulation, namely the stepping and ramping modulations of the optical path diﬀerence.

B. Stepping Phase Modulation

The stepping phase modulation realized when the pathlength diﬀerence is changes

as a set of discrete values corresponding to a number of steps in the OPD space.

mathematically this process represented as follows:

Conditions (83) allow for a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of temporal integration in

Eq. (81). It simply is leading to a substitution x(t)

xi in Eq. (43), and matrix ˜

As a result, to the second order in the phase variation (i.e. φ(kℓ)

( ∂2φ

observational equation (82) is taking form as below:

(cid:3)

The obtained result Eq. (85) clearly depends on the particular form of the envelope

function. As such, it has most of the parameters that are necessary for the phase

estimation purposes in the case of wide bandwidth.

For the most practical cases the value of the sinc function will be close to sinc

1.

Indeed, let us analyze the argument of this function, 1

2∆kℓ

xi + d0ℓ). Thus, one might

expect that within the spectral channel the phase will stay constant, hence d0ℓ =

(cid:0)

0. Furthermore, for the estimation purposes let us assume that all the step-

sizes xi are essentially xi = i λ0

N , where N is the total number of temporal integration

bins, i is the number of a particular temporal bin, i

[1, ..., N], and λ0 is the reference

∈

wavelength chosen for the OPD modulation (or λ0 = 2π
k0

, where k0 is the wavenumber

corresponding to chosen modulation wavelength). Also remember that the width of a

spectral channel is related to the total SIM bandwidth as ∆kℓ = ∆kSIM

L , where ∆kSIM

is the total SIM bandwidth and L is the total number of spectral channels used for

the white light fringe detection. Therefore, one has

Assuming λ−

SIM = 450 nm and λ+

SIM = 900 nm, and λ0 = 900 nm, thus yielding

Currently, there are diﬀerent numbers of spectral channels used to process data from

our testbeds. This number may be as large as L = 80 and as small as L = 4. Of coarse,

when L = 80, the ratio π/L becomes π/L = 0.03927 and, thus, sinc[ 1

0.99974, and similarly for L = 4 the sinc function becomes sinc[ 1

2 ∆kℓxi]

L=80 =

2∆kℓxi]

L=4 = 0.90032.

We will address the issue of phase estimation sensitivity to the width of a spectral

channel ∆kℓ at a later time.

This observation allows us to present the sinc function as a series with respect to

the small parameter ∆kℓz (with z being deﬁned as z = xi + d0ℓ) as

The obtained expression models the expected number of photons detected at the

CCD for the rectangular bandpass ﬁlter and stepping phase modulation. It extends

the results obtained for the monochromatic case on the ﬁnite size spectral bandwidth.

This fact is indicated by the explicit dependency of the obtained result on the width

of a spectral channel ∆kℓ. (For the most of the interesting practical applications, the

size of the delay within a particular spectral channel is very small d0ℓ = ∂φ

0,

∂kℓ ≈

which further simpliﬁes Eq. (89)).

C. Ramping Phase Modulation

In this Section we will discuss another type of phase modulation – the case when

the phase is linearly changes with time. This modulation utilizes the phase ramping

technique.(For more details, see Refs.6-7.) To develop analytical solution we will be

using the system equations developed above, speciﬁcally Eqs. (51) and (55).

The optical path diﬀerence for the case of ramping phase modulation is modeled

45

as a continuous function of time as follows:

x(t) = x0 + v t,

(90)

where x0 is the initial OPD value and v is the instantaneous velocity of OPD mod-

ulation. Remembering the deﬁnition for τ as τ = t

of power series expansion with respect to the small parameter ∆kℓz(τ ) as given by

fact is indicated by the explicit dependency of the obtained result on the width of a

spectral channel ∆kℓ.

6. Discussion and Future Plans

The main objective of this paper has been to introduce the reader to the concepts and

the instrumental logic of the SIM astrometric observations, especially as they relate to

estimation of the white light fringe parameters. The set of formulae described herein

will serve as the kernel for the future mission analysis and simulations. We have

also developed a set of expressions that may be used for fringe visibility and phase

extraction for both SIM science and guide interferometers. The obtained expressions

depend on the eﬀective operational wavelength of OPD modulation, the width of a

particular spectral channel ∆kℓ with the mean wavenumber kℓ and corresponding

wavelength λℓ. Our model accounts for a number of instrumental and physical eﬀects

and is able to compensate for a number of operational regimes.

48

The logic of our method is straightforward: one ﬁrst assumes the desirable prop-

erties of the bandpass ﬁlter, then ﬁnds the corresponding envelope function, and then

applies the obtained expressions (which are valid for a generic case). The obtained

solutions for the envelope function W and, most speciﬁcally, δ ˜
P

ℓi may be directly sub-

stituted either in the expression for the complex visibility phasors Eqs. (70)-(71), or

into equations for the visibility, amplitude and phase of the fringe, given by Eqs.(72).

We applied this formalism to the case of a rectangular bandpass (the obtained re-

sults are given by Eqs. (118)-(121)). While the complex visibility phasors are linear

with respect to photon counts, the explicit expressions for the fringe parameters are

non-linear. This fact may be used to design speciﬁc properties of unbiased fringe

estimators for processing the white light data.

Having developed algorithm to obtain the best estimates for the fringe parame-

ters, Eqs. (72) it is naturally to write down the expression that would allow to estimate

the group delay for the polychromatic case. It turns out that the following expression

d = 1
N

L

ℓ ( ¯φ⋄

P

ℓ /kℓ) is suﬃcient to estimate the group delay for the SIM bandwidth

to the required accuracy of a few tens of picometers.19 This single channel error ex-

pression can be used to determine the group delay error when combining multiple

spectral channels of data via phase delay or group delay methods. These errors will

vary based on the underlying assumptions, but a reasonable ﬁgure of merit to keep

in mind is that a random 1% error in the wavelength combined with the nominal 10

nm rms delay requirement leads to approximately 60 pm of delay error when using

4 spectral channels of data processed with a least squares algorithm for each chan-

nel. This result scales linearly with the wavelength error and the delay oﬀset. In our

49

further work we will numerically address the problem of unbiased estimators for the

fringe phase, visibility and group delay. This eﬀort is currently underway.

Our analysis shows3, 19 that, while the model of the rectangular bandpass ﬁlter

is working quite well, for the ‘real life’ one must account for the eﬀect of leakage of

light. This eﬀect due to the leakage of light onto the studied spectrometer pixel of

the detector from the adjacent pixels with diﬀerent wavenumbers. At this moment,

it seams more appropriate that a combination of the rectangular bandpass ﬁlter with

additional eﬀect of light leakage from the adjacent pixels that must be included into

the model of a CCD detector. The corresponding analysis, simulation results and

implications for the instrument design will be reported elsewhere.

A. Two Deﬁnitions for the Fringe Phase

In this Appendix we will address the issue of the mean phase deﬁnition which requires

some additional work. It is tempting to deﬁne the mean phase as

φℓ =

k+

I0ℓ(k)φ(k)dk

(101)

However, one needs to relate this expression to the quantity φ(kℓ), which is the phase

value at a particular wavenumber. Assuming that phase φ(k) is a slow varying function

of k and, as such, it may be expanded in a Taylor series as follows:

φ(k) = φ(kℓ) +

Or in other words, the phase value φ(kℓ) at a particular wavenumber kℓ is related to

the mean phase φℓ within the spectral channel with width ∆kℓ (i.e. Eq.(101)) by the

following expression

B. Approximation for the Complex Fringe Envelope Function

Expression for the fringe envelope function Eq. (39), contains terms that are of the

ﬁrst and higher orders of phase variation within the ℓ-th spectral channel. We shell

51

separate these terms by expanding phase φ(k) in the Taylor series around the mean

wavenumber kℓ as given by Eq. (102). This transforms the argument in Eq. (39) as:

C. Solution for Rectangular Bandpass and Stepping OPD Modulation

In consideration of completeness, we present here a general case solution for an

optimally-weighted visibility phasor for a rectangular bandpass and stepping OPD

modulation. In the previous Section we obtained this solution in a general case, there-

fore, the desired solution may be obtained directly with the help of expressions (71).

Corresponding optimally-weighted solution may be presented in the form of Eqs. (71)

The obtained result Eqs. (121) clearly depends on the sinc envelope function and

thus it has all the information that is necessary for the phase estimation purposes in

the case of the wide band-pass. Note, that this result assumes that the phase does

not change inside the spectral channel. Also, this result directly corresponds to the

result obtained for the monochromatic case. This may be demonstrated by taking the

limit ∆k/¯k

A. The Optimally Weighted 4-bin (ABCD) Algorithm

Results obtained in the previous Section are valid for any number of OPD modu-

lation steps. In order to show their correspondence to well-known formulations we

will present their particular form for the case with N = 4, equal step sizes and

wavelength-matched OPD modulation strokes. This will allow us to obtain results

that are constituting a four-bin algorithm.

Thus, in the case of 4 equal step sizes all of 1

4λ, the OPD is stepping in increments

of xi = λ

4 i, i

∈

[1, ..., 4] that correspond to the phase changing in steps of φi = π

2 i. By

This is the optimally weighed form of the most well-known fringe estimation

ABCD algorithm. The absence of extra π

4 phase in the result φ0 is due to the phase-

stepping approach.5, 15 In the case when experimental noise is absent, this result di-

rectly correspond to the previously obtained solutions for the ABCD algorithm in the

monochromatic case.

(October 29, 1996)

We study degenerate three photon down conversion as a potential scheme for generating nonclas-
sical states of light which exhibit clear signatures of phase space interference. The Wigner function
representing these states contains an interference pattern manifesting quantum coherence between
distinct phase space components, and has substantial areas of negativity. We develop an analytical
description of the interference pattern, which demonstrates how the oscillations of the Wigner func-
tion are built up by the superposition principle. We analyze the impact of dissipation and pump
ﬂuctuations on the visibility of the interference pattern; the results suggest that some signatures of
quantum coherence can be observed in the presence of moderate amount of noise.

I. INTRODUCTION

The superposition principle is a fundamental ingredi-
ent of quantum theory, resulting in interference phenom-
ena not existing in classical mechanics. In atomic, molec-
ular, and optical physics this striking feature of quantum
mechanics can be studied within several examples of sim-
ple quantum systems: a trapped ion, a diatomic molecule
and a single electromagnetic ﬁeld mode in a cavity or
free space. In this context Schleich and Wheeler [1] de-
veloped a phase space picture of quantum interference.
They demonstrated in the semiclassical limit, that quan-
tum mechanical transition probabilities are governed by
a set of simple rules in the phase space: a probability
amplitude is given by a sum of overlap areas, with phase
factors deﬁned by an area caught between the states.

Recent developments in quantum optics have gener-
ated signiﬁcantly increased interest in the phase space
representation of quantum states, providing feasible
schemes for measuring the Wigner functions of a single
light mode [2–4], the vibrational manifold of a diatomic
molecule [5], and the motional state of a trapped atom
[6], or an atomic beam [7]. These advances open up new
possibilities in experimental studies of the quantum su-
perposition principle, as the Wigner function provides
direct insight into the interference phenomena through
its fringes and negativities, and also completely charac-
terizes the quantum state. Additionally, negativity of the
Wigner function is a strong evidence for the distinctness
of quantum mechanics from classical statistical theory.
Consequently, it is now possible to obtain full information
on the coherence properties of a quantum state by mea-
suring its Wigner function, instead of observing quantum
interference only as fringes in marginal distributions of
single observables.

Therefore, schemes for generating quantum states
with nontrivial phase space quasidistributions, especially
those possessing substantial negativities, are of consider-
able interest. The system that appears to provide the
most opportunities currently is a trapped ion, whose

quantum state can be quite easily manipulated through
interaction with suitably applied laser beams [8]. In the
case of travelling optical ﬁelds, the range of available in-
teractions is far more restricted, and generating states
with interesting phase space properties is a nontrivial
task from both theoretical and experimental points of
view. One of the states that most clearly illustrate quan-
tum interference is a superposition of two distinct coher-
ent states [9], whose generation in microwave frequency
range has been recently reported [10]. Production of
these states in the optical domain has been a subject
of considerable theoretical interest. Though several inge-
nious schemes have been proposed [11–14], they require
extremely precise control over the dynamics of the sys-
tem, which makes them very diﬃcult to implement ex-
perimentally.

In this paper we study degenerate three photon down
conversion [15–22] as a scheme for generating states of
light that exhibit clear signatures of phase space inter-
ference. This generation scheme seems to be quite at-
tractive, since, as we will show, it is not overly sensitive
to some sources of noise. Additionally, numerous exper-
imental realizations of two photon down conversion for
generating squeezed light give a solid basis for studying
higher order processes, at least in principle, and devel-
opments in nonlinear optical materials suggest it may be
possible to re–examine higher–order nonlinear quantum
eﬀects.

Interference features of states generated in higher or-
der down conversion have been ﬁrst noted by Braunstein
and Caves [17], who showed oscillations in quadrature
distributions and explained them as a result of coher-
ent overlap of two arms displayed by the Q function.
The purpose of the present paper is to provide a detailed
analysis of the interference features, based on the Wigner
function rather than distributions of single observables.
Compared to the Q function, discussed previously by
several authors, the Wigner function carries explicit ev-
idence of quantum coherence in the form of oscillations
and negative areas. These features are not visible in the
Q function, which describes inevitably noisy simultane-

1

ous measurement of the position and the momentum.

The states generated in three photon down conversion
cannot be described using simple analytical formulae. It
is thus necessary to resort to numerical means in order
to discuss their phase space properties. However we will
show that the interference features can be understood
with the help of simple analytical calculations. These
calculations will reveal the essential role of the superpo-
sition principle in creating the interference pattern in the
phase space. Experimental realization of the discussed
scheme along with detection of the Wigner function of
the generated ﬁeld would be an explicit optical demon-
stration of totally nonclassical quantum interference in
the phase space.

This paper is organized as follows. First, in Sec. II, we
discuss some general properties of the Wigner function.
In Sec. III we present the numerical approach used to deal
with three photon down conversion. The Wigner function
representing states generated in this process is studied in
detail in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we discuss brieﬂy prospects
of experimental demonstration of quantum interference
using the studied scheme. Finally, Sec. VI concludes the
results.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Before we present the phase space picture of three pho-
ton down conversion, let us ﬁrst discuss in general how
the interference pattern is built up in the phase space by
the superposition principle. Our initial considerations
will closely follow previous discussions of the semiclassi-
cal limit of the Wigner function [23]. They will give us
later a better understanding of the interference we are
concerned with in three photon down conversion, and
help us to derive an analytical description of the inter-
ference pattern for this speciﬁc case.

We will start by considering a wave function of the

form

ψ(q) =

(q) exp[i

(q)],

A

S

(1)

S

(q) is a real function deﬁning the phase and

where
(q)
is a slowly varying positive envelope. The Wigner func-
tion of this state is given by (throughout this paper we
put ¯h = 1):

Let us ﬁrst separate the contribution from the direct
neighborhood of the point q. For this purpose we will
(q) up to the linear term and take
expand the phase
the value of the envelope at the point q, which gives

S

Thus, this contribution is localized around the momen-
′(q), and creates a concentration along the “tra-
tum
′(q)). This result has a straightforward
jectory” (q, p =
interpretation in the WKB approximation of the energy
eigenfunctions, where the phase
(q) is the classical ac-
tion and its spatial derivative yields the momentum. In
this case, Eq. (3) simply states that the Wigner func-
tion contains a positive component localized along the
classical trajectory [23].

S

We will now study more carefully the relation between
the wave function and the Wigner function, taking into
account contributions from other parts of the wave func-
tion, denoted symbolically by dots in Eq. (3). To make
the discussion more general, we will take the wave func-
tion to be a superposition of ﬁnite number of components
deﬁned in Eq. (1):

ψ(q) =

Ai(q) exp[i

Si(q)].

We will evaluate these integrals with the help of the sta-

tionary points is given by the equation

j (q + x/2) = 2p,

(6)

which has a very simple geometrical intepretation.
It
shows that the contribution to the Wigner function at
the point (q, p) comes from the points of the “trajecto-
ries” (qi, pi =

′
i(q)) and (qj, pj =

′
j(q)) satisfying

S

S

(qi + qj)/2 = q
(pi + pj)/2 = p,

(7)

i.e. (q, p) is a midpoint of the line connecting the points
(qi, pi) and (qj, pj). These points may lie either on the
same trajectory, i.e. i = j or on a pair of diﬀerent ones.
In particular, for i = j we get that qi = qj = q is always
′
a stationary point for p =
i(q), which justiﬁes the ap-
S
proximation applied in deriving Eq. (3). At these points
the second derivative of the phase disappears. There-
fore we will calculate them separately, using the previous
method. For the remaining pairs, we expand the phases
up to quadratic terms and perform the resulting Gaus-
sian integrals. As before, we neglect variation of the en-
velopes, taking their values at the stationary points. This
yields an approximate form of the Wigner function:

where the second double sum excludes the case i = j and
qi = qj = q.

S

Thus, the Wigner function of the state deﬁned in
Eq. (4) exhibits two main features. The ﬁrst one is
presence of positive humps localized along “trajectories”
′(qi)). Any pair of points on these trajectories
(qi, pi =
gives rise to the interference pattern of the Wigner func-
tion at the midpoint of the line connecting this pair. Let
us note that the result that the interference pattern in
a given area is generated by equidistant opposite pieces
of the quasidistribution corresponds to the phase space
picture of the superposition of two coherent states [2,9],
for which the interference structure lies precisely in the
center between the interfering states.

III. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

Numerical results presented in the following parts of
the paper are obtained using a model of two quantized
light modes: the signal and the pump, coupled by the
interaction Hamiltonian:

ˆH = iλ[ˆb(ˆa†)3

ˆb†ˆa3],

−

(9)

where λ is the coupling constant, and ˆa and ˆb are the
annihilation operators of the signal and pump mode, re-
spectively. This Hamiltonian is very convenient for nu-
merical calculations, as it commutes with the operator
ˆN = 3ˆa†ˆa + ˆb†ˆb, and can be diagonalized separately in
each of the ﬁnite–dimensional eigenspaces of ˆN . Details
of the basic numerical approach to these kinds of Hamil-
tonians can be found for example in Refs. [18,19].
In
contrast, the limit of a classical, undepleted pump is dif-
ﬁcult to implement numerically due to singularities of the
evolution operator on the imaginary time axis [15].

We assume that initially the signal mode is in the vac-

After evolution of the system for the time t, which we cal-
culate in the interaction picture, we obtain the reduced
density matrix of the signal ﬁeld by performing the trace

In general, ˆρ(t) describes a mixed state, as the interacting
modes get entangled in the course of evolution. This den-
sity matrix is then used to calculate the Wigner function
and other obervables of the signal mode studied further
in the paper. In the discussions, we will make use of the

(10)

analogy between a single light mode and a harmonic os-
cillator, assigning the names position and momentum to
the quadratures ˆq = (ˆa + ˆa†)/√2 and ˆp = (ˆa
ˆa†)/√2i,
respectively.

IV. WIGNER FUNCTION

We will restrict our studies to the regime of a strong
pump and a short interaction time. This regime is the
most reasonable one from experimental point of view,
as strong pumping allows us to compensate for the usu-
ally weak eﬀect of nonlinearity, and the short interaction
time gives us a chance to ignore or to suppress dissipa-
tion. We can gain some intuition about the dynamics of
the system by considering the classical case; this is done
in Appendix A. The most important conclusion is that
in the classical picture the origin of the phase space is an
unstable ﬁxed point, with three symmetric directions of
growth, in a star–like formation.

In Fig. 1 we depict the Wigner function representing
the state of the signal ﬁeld generated for the parameters
β = 10 and t = 0.025/λ. This state is almost pure, as
Tr[ˆρ2] = 0.92 indicates little entanglement between the
pump and the down–converted mode. The three devel-
oping arms follow the classical directions of growth from
the unstable origin of the phase space. The coherence
between these components results in an interference pat-
tern ﬁlling the regions between the arms, consisting of
positive and negative strips. Thus, the Wigner function
is “forced” by the superposition principle to take nega-
tive values in order to manifest the quantum coherence
of the state.

Let us now study in more detail how the interference
pattern is generated by coherent superposition of distinct
phase space components. We will focus our attention on
the three arms displayed by the quasidistribution, ne-
glecting the bulk of positive probability at the origin
of the phase space remaining from the initial vacuum
“source” state. As the purity factor of the generated
state is close to one, we will base our calculations on
pure states. The relation between the wave function and
the Wigner function derived in Sec. II suggests that the
arms can be modelled by three components of the wave
function:

ϕ(q) = ϕ0(q) + ϕ1(q) + ϕ2(q)

(11)

with slowly varying envelopes and the position–
S1(q) = √3q2/2,
dependent phase factors:
√3q2/2, respectively. The interference
and
pattern observed in the phase space is a result of the
coherent superposition of these three components.

S0(q) = 0,

S2(q) =

−

However, in order to calculate quantitatively the struc-
ture of the interference pattern, we need to know the
relative phase factors between the wave functions in
Eq. (11). We will obtain these factors with the help of
the additional information that the Hamiltonian deﬁned

3

in Eq. (9) excites or annihilates triplets of signal photons.
Consequently, the photon distribution of the generated
state is nonzero only for Fock states being multiples of
three, as the initial state was the vacuum. Using this fact,
we can deﬁne an operator which performs a rotation in
phase space by an angle θ:

ˆU (θ) = exp(

iθˆa†ˆa)

(12)

−
and impose the relations ϕ1 = ˆU (2π/3)ϕ0 and ϕ2 =
ˆU (4π/3)ϕ0. This choice for the phase of the operator
ˆU (θ) ensures that the superposition deﬁned in Eq. (11)
has the necessary property to generate the correct triplet
photon statistics. Let us now assume that ϕ0 is given
by a slowly varying positive function
(q), localized for
q > 0. We will not consider any speciﬁc form of the
envelope
(q), as the main purpose of this model is to
predict the position and shape of the interference fringes.
The other two wave functions can be calculated with the
help of the formula derived in Appendix B, which ﬁnally
yields:

(13)

Given this result, we can use the approximate form of
the Wigner function in Eq. (8) to model the numerically
calculated Wigner function. Some problems arise from
the fact that the three components are localized along
straight lines. In this case the stationary phase approxi-
mation fails to work for points belonging to the same arm,
and the Wigner function of each component depends sub-
stantially on the envelope. Therefore we will denote them
as Wϕ0 (q, p), Wϕ1(q, p), and Wϕ2 (q, p) without specifying
their detailed form. Nevertheless, the stationary phase
approximation can be safely used to calculate the inter-
ference pattern between the arms, where the contributing
points belong to two distinct arms. Thus we represent the
model Wigner function as a sum of four components

Wϕ(q, p) = Wϕ0 (q, p) + Wϕ1 (q, p)

+Wϕ2(q, p) + Wint(q, p),

In Fig. 1(b) we superpose the pattern generated by the
interference term of the model Wigner function on top of
the numerically calculated quasidistribution; the agree-
ment between the two is excellent. Thus, our model ef-
fectively describes the form of the interference pattern
and predicts negative areas of the Wigner function.

±

Let us emphasize that this analytical model is based
exclusively on two considerations: the position of the in-
terfering components in the phase space, and the phase
relations between them, which were derived from our
study of the triplet photon statistics for this problem.
This shows that the interference pattern is very “stiﬀ”,
i.e. these two considerations strictly impose its speciﬁc
form. Consequently, the interference pattern does not
change substantially as long as the crucial features of the

state remain ﬁxed.
In particular, the interaction time
and the pump amplitude have only a slight inﬂuence on
the basic form of the interference pattern, as they deter-
mine only the amount of probability density transferred
to the arms of the quasidistribution.

V. CONSEQUENCES OF PHASE SPACE
INTERFERENCE AND EXPERIMENTAL
PROSPECTS

We will now brieﬂy review the consequences of these
phase–space interference eﬀects and the prospects for ex-
perimental demonstration of quantum interference us-
ing three photon down conversion. First, let us discuss
signatures of quantum coherence that can be directly
observed in the experimental data. An experimentally
established technique for measuring the Wigner func-
tion of a light mode is optical homodyne tomography

4

[2–4].
In this method, the Wigner function is recon-
structed from distributions of the quadrature operator
ˆxθ = (ˆae−iθ + ˆa†eiθ)/√2, measured with the help of a
balanced homodyne detector. These distributions are
projections of the Wigner function on the axis deﬁned
by the equation q cos θ
p sin θ = 0. In Fig. 2 we plot
the quadrature distributions for the phase θ in the range
(0, π/6). Due to the symmetry of the Wigner function,
other distributions have the same form, up to the trans-
formation x

x.

−

The fringes appearing for x < 0 in Fig. 2 are a clear
signature of quantum coherence between the two arms
of the quasidistribution that are projected onto the same
half–axis. We can describe the position of the fringes us-
ing the model three–component wave function derived in
Eq. (13). For simplicity, we will consider only the phase
θ = 0, for which the fringes have the best visibility due
to equal contributions from both the arms. The model
quadrature distribution in the half–axis x < 0 is given by

|
|
Analysis of this expression reveals some interesting analo-
gies. Expanding the argument of the cosine function
around a point x yields that the “local” spacing between
the consecutive fringes is π/√3x. The same result can
be obtained by considering a superposition of two coher-
ent states centered at the points (x, √3x) and (x,
√3x),
i.e., where the contributing pieces of the arms are local-
ized. Furthermore, the argument of the cosine function
in Eq. (16) is equal, up to an additive constant, to half
of the area caught between the two arms of the gener-
ated state, and the Wigner function of the position eigen-
state representing the measurement. Thus, the quadra-
ture distribution given in Eq. (16) illustrates Schleich
and Wheeler’s phase space rules for calculating quantum
transition probabilities [1].

−

Let us now estimate the eﬀect of dissipation and
nonunit detector eﬃciency on the interference pattern
exhibited by the Wigner function. For this purpose we
will calculate evolution of the generated state under the
master equation:

where γ is the damping parameter. Evolution over the
interval ∆t yields the state that is eﬀectively measured
in a homodyne setup with imperfect detectors charac-
terized by the quantum eﬃciency η = exp(
In
phase space, the eﬀect of dissipation is represented by
coarsening of the Wigner function by convolution with a
Gaussian function [24]:

This coarsening smears out entirely the very ﬁne details
of the Wigner function, whose characteristic length is
η). In Fig. 3 we plot the Wigner
smaller than
function along the position axis as a function of η. The
interference pattern disappears faster in the area more
distant from the origin of the phase space, where the fre-
quency of the oscillations is larger. Nevertheless, the ﬁrst
negative dip, which is the widest one, can still be noticed
even for η = 0.8.

Current technology gives some optimistic ﬁgures about
the possibility of detecting the interference pattern, as
virtually 100% eﬃcient photodetectors are available in
the range of light intensities measured (in a diﬀerent con-
text, that of squeezed light) in a homodyne scheme [25].
However, there are also other mechanisms of losses, such
as absorption during nonlinear interaction and nonunit
overlap of the homodyned modes, whose importance can-
not be estimated without reference to a speciﬁc experi-
mental setup. An analysis of these would be out of place
here.

Let us ﬁnally consider the impact of pump ﬂuctuations
on the interference pattern. We illustrate the discussion
with Fig. 4, depicting the state generated using a noisy
pump ﬁeld modelled by a Gaussian P –representation

where β0 is the average ﬁeld amplitude and ¯n is the num-
ber of thermal photons. In discussing the eﬀect of noise,
we have to distinguish between phase and amplitude ﬂuc-
tuations. Phase ﬂuctuations have a quite deleterious ef-
fect, as a change in the pump phase by ϑ is equivalent
to the rotation of the signal phase space by ϑ/3. Con-
sequently, phase ﬂuctuations average the signal Wigner
function over a certain phase range. The fringes are most
fragile near the arms due to neighboring bulk of positive
probability. The interference pattern in the areas be-
tween the arms varies slowly with phase, which makes
it more robust. These properties are clearly visible in
Fig. 4. The eﬀect of amplitude ﬂuctuations is not crucial,
as the position of the fringes does not depend substan-
tially on the pump amplitude.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that degenerate three photon
down conversion generates nonclassical states of light,
whose Wigner function exhibits nontrivial interference
pattern due to coherent superposition of distinct phase
space components. We have developed an analytical
description of this pattern, which precisely predicts its
form. Let us note that the rich phase space picture of
higher order down conversion contrasts with the two pho-
ton case, where the only signature of quantum coherence
is suppression of quadrature dispersion [26].

Discussion of the impact of dissipation and pump ﬂuc-
tuations on the coherence properties of the generated
state shows that the interference pattern can partly be
observed even in the presence of moderate amount of
noise. An important element of the studied scheme is
that the signal state is generated using a strong exter-
nal pump, which enhances the usually weak eﬀect of χ(3)
nonlinearity. This allows us the optimism to expect that
three photon down conversion is perhaps more feasible
than schemes based on nonlinear self–interaction of the
signal ﬁeld.

The analytical method developed in this paper to de-
scribe the phase space interference pattern can be applied
to other cases, where the quasidistribution is a coherent
superposition of well localized components, for example
superpositions of two squeezed states [27], and squeezed
coherent states for the SU(1,1) group [28].

APPENDIX A: CLASSICAL DYNAMICS OF
THREE PHOTON DOWN CONVERSION

The dynamics of multiphoton down conversion under
classical and quantum equations of motion has been com-
pared in detail by Braunstein and McLachlan [15]; see
also Ref. [29]. Here, for completeness, we brieﬂy discuss
classical trajectories for three photon down conversion in
the approximation of a constant pump. As the change in
the pump phase is equivalent to the rotation of the sig-
nal phase space, we can assume with no loss of generality
that the pump amplitude β is a real positive number. We
will now decompose the complex signal ﬁeld amplitude
into its modulus u and the phase θ. The classical Hamil-
tonian in this parametrization reads

H(u, θ) = 2λβu3 sin 3θ,

(A1)

and the resulting equations of motion are

phases equal to multiples of π/3. The direction of mo-
tion can be read out from Eqs. (A2), showing that the
sign of the derivative dθ/dτ is negative for the phases in
the intervals (0, π/3), (2π/3, π), and (4π/3, 5π/3), and
positive in the remaining areas. The resulting picture of
dynamics is presented in Fig. 5. It is seen that the origin
of the phase space is a three–fold unstable ﬁxed point,
with the direction of growth θ = 0, 2π/3, and 4π/3.

APPENDIX B: ROTATING THE WAVE
FUNCTION IN PHASE SPACE

In this appendix we will calculate the rotation of a
wave function deﬁned by a slowly varying positive func-
tion

around the origin of the phase space. An operator per-

The stationary phase point for the exponential factor is
q′ = q/ cos θ. We will take the value of
(q′) at this point
and perform the integral. Some care has to be taken in
choosing the proper branch of the square root function,
when simplifying the ﬁnal expression. The easiest way to
avoid problems is to consider separately four intervals of
θ, between 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π. The ﬁnal result is:

the system is conserved, trajectories of the system are
deﬁned by the equation u3 cos 3θ = const. Thus, tra-
jectories are of hyperbolic–like shape, with asymptotic

A new theory has been advanced, through expressing the vector angular spectrum of the electric

ﬁeld of a 3D light beam in terms of its s and p polarization components, to describe both the lateral

Goos-H¨anchen (GH) eﬀect and the transverse Imbert-Fedorov (IF) eﬀect. From this theory, the

quantization characteristics of the GH and IF displacements are obtained, the Artmann formula for

the GH displacement is derived, and the nature of IF eﬀect is discovered. It is predicted that when

an elliptically polarized light beam is intersected obliquely with a plane interface, the beam itself

is transversely displaced from a reference plane. This displacement is quantized with eigenstates

the opposite circular polarizations and eigen displacements the same in magnitude and opposite in

direction. The maximum of the displacement is as large as the order of the beam waist width.

Introduction.—In 1947, Goos and H¨anchen [1] experimentally demonstrated that a to-

tally reﬂected light beam at a plane dielectric interface is laterally displaced in the incidence

plane from the position predicted by geometrical reﬂection. Artmann [2] in the next year

advanced a formula for this displacement on the basis of a stationary-phase argument. This

phenomenon is now referred to as Goos-H¨anchen (GH) eﬀect. In 1955, Fedorov [3] expected

a transverse displacement of a totally reﬂected beam from the fact that an elliptical polar-

ization of the incident beam entails a non-zero transverse energy ﬂux inside the evanescent

wave. Imbert [4] calculated this displacement using an energy ﬂux argument developed by

Renard [5] for the GH eﬀect and experimentally measured it. This phenomenon is usually

called Imbert-Fedorov (IF) eﬀect. The investigation of the GH eﬀect has been extended to

the cases of partial reﬂection and transmission in transmitting conﬁgurations [6, 7] and to

other areas of physics, such as acoustics [8], nonlinear optics [9], plasma physics [10], and

quantum mechanics [5, 11]. And the investigation of the IF eﬀect has been connected with

the angular momentum conservation and the Hall eﬀect of light [12, 13]. But the comment

of Beauregard and Imbert [14] is still valid up to now that there are, strictly speaking, no

completely rigorous calculations of the GH or IF displacement. Though the argument of

stationary phase was used to explain [2] the GH displacement and to calculate the IF dis-

placement [15], it was on the basis of the formal properties of the Poynting vector inside the

evanescent wave [14] that the quantization characteristics were acquired for both the GH

and IF displacements in total reﬂection. On the other hand, it has been found that the GH

displacement in transmitting conﬁgurations has nothing to do with the evanescent wave [7].

The purpose of this Letter is to advance a uniﬁed theory for both the GH and IF eﬀects

through expressing the vector angular spectrum of the electric ﬁeld of a 3D light beam

in terms of its s (or TE) and p (or TM) polarization components. From this theory, the

quantization characteristics of the GH and IF displacements are obtained, the Artmann

formula [2] for the GH displacement is derived, and the nature of the IF displacement is

discovered. It is found that when an elliptically polarized light beam is intersected obliquely

with a plane interface, the beam itself is displaced transversely from a reference plane. This

displacement has nothing to do with the evanescent wave and is quantized with eigenstates

the opposite circular polarizations. The eigen displacements are the same in magnitude and

opposite in direction. The IF eﬀect is such a displacement suﬀered by the totally reﬂected

beam.

General theory.—Consider a monochromatic 3D light beam in a homogenous and isotropic

medium of refractive index n. The beam is intersected with the plane interface x = 0. In

order to have a light beam representation that can describe the propagation parallel to the

x-axis, the vector electric ﬁeld of the beam is expressed in terms of the vector amplitude

distribution A(ky, kz) of its angular spectrum as follows [16],

E(x) =

that the integral limits have been extended to −∞ and ∞ for both variables ky and kz [17].

When this beam is intersected with the plane x = 0, the ﬁeld distribution on this plane is

are the respective phase shifts in reﬂection. It is noted that ˜Lr satisﬁes the normalization
† ˜Lr = 1. Since Φs and Φp are all even functions of kz, we have for the y
condition ˜Lr

appreciable, the reﬂected beam maintains the shape of the incident beam [19] and therefore

Eq. (13) produces the GH displacement of the following form,

DGH = hyir − hyii = −|l1|2 ∂Φs

− |l2|2 ∂Φp

,

which leads naturally to the Artmann formula [2] for s or p polarization and agrees well with

the recent experimental results [20, 21]. This equation tells us that the GH displacement

originates from the propagation-direction dependence of the phase shifts in total reﬂection.

Nature of IF eﬀect.—Now we pay our attention to the more interesting problem, the IF

eﬀect. As before, we ﬁrst want to ﬁnd out the z coordinate of the propagation axis of the
incident beam on the plane x = 0. To this end, we express ˜Li on the orthogonal complete

set of circular polarizations as follows,

˜Li = c1˜r + c2˜l,

(14)

where ˜r = U˜s is the normalized state of right circular polarization, ˜l = U˜p is the nor-

malized state of left circular polarization, and U is the unitary transformation matrix

. On applying Eqs.

(3), (6), and (8) to ˜Ai and with the help of Eq.

(14), we have for the z coordinate of the propagation axis of the incident beam on the plane

hzii = (|c1|2 − |c2|2)hzii

It is rather surprising that hzii is not equal to zero as is commonly implied. According

to the wave vector (11) of the propagation axis, Eq. (15) reveals a general property that

when a light beam is intersected obliquely with a plane interface, the plane formed by its

propagation axis and the normal of the interface is transversely displaced from the reference

plane z = 0.

In other words, the beam itself is displaced from the plane z = 0. The

displacement is dependent on the polarization state of the beam and is quantized with

eigenstates the opposite circular polarizations. The eigen displacements, ±hzii

c, are the

same in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let us investigate the details of this displacement with the following elliptical polarization,

l1 = cos ψ,

l2 = exp(−iφ) sin ψ,

This shows that (i) when the beam is in s or p polarization (ψ = 0 or ψ = π/2) or in any of

oblique linear polarization (φ = mπ, m = 0, ±1, ±2...), we have hzii = 0; (ii) hzii changes

its sign when the polarization is changed from left ellipse to right ellipse or vice versa (when

φ is replaced by φ + π); (iii) the magnitude of hzii is maximum when the beam is in circular
polarizations (ψ = π/4 and φ = (m + 1/2)π) for given θ0; (iv) hzii changes its sign when θ0

is changed in sign.

It is helpful to have a look at the dependence of the eigen displacement, hzii

c, on the

incidence angle θ0 for the state of right circular polarization (ψ = π/4, φ = (2m + 1/2)π),

(a) When θ0 is much larger than half the divergence angle, ∆θ = 1/(kw0), the ﬁrst factor of

the integrand in Eq. (18) can be simply taken out of the integral with ky and kz replaced
respectively by ky0 and 0, resulting in [22] hzii

Applying the same procedure to ˜Ar gives the transverse displacement of the totally re-

ﬂected beam from the reference plane z = 0. Such deﬁned displacement is the so-called IF

eﬀect [4, 14, 20, 21]. For the incidence polarization given by Eq. (16), the IF displacement

of the reﬂected beam is

(19)

The diﬀerence between Eq. (19) and Eq. (17) is that the factor sin(φ + Φs − Φp) of the

integrand in Eq. (19) takes the place of the factor sin φ in Eq. (17). Since Eq. (19) holds

whether the beam is totally reﬂected by a single dielectric interface [20] or by a thin dielectric

ﬁlm in a resonance conﬁguration [21], it is no wonder that the observed IF displacement in

the resonance conﬁguration [21] is not enhanced in the way that the lateral GH displacement

is enhanced.

When the total reﬂection takes place at a single dielectric interface and the incidence angle

is far away from the critical angle for total reﬂection and the angle of grazing incidence in

comparison with half the divergence angle, the ﬁrst and the last factors of the integrand in

Eq. (19) can be regarded as constants for a well-collimated beam [19] and thus can be taken

out of the integral with ky, kz, Φs, and Φp evaluated at ky = ky0 and kz = kz0, producing

DIF =

sin(2ψ) sin(φ + Φs0 − Φp0)
k tan θ0

.

(20)

This shows that for given θ0, the magnitude of DIF is maximum for circularly polarized

reﬂected beams (ψ = π/4 and φ + Φs0 − Φp0 = (m + 1/2)π). It also shows that the nonzero

IF displacement in the case of oblique linear polarization of the incident beam (φ = mπ) [4]

results from the diﬀerent phase shifts between s and p polarizations in total reﬂection. The

incidence angle dependence ∼ 1/ tan θ0 is in consistency with the recent experimental result

[23]. Since all the previous experiments [4, 20, 21, 23] were performed at incidence angles

that are larger than the critical angle for total reﬂection, it is no wonder that the measured

IF displacement, being of the order of λ0/2π, is very small.

Concluding Remarks.—We have shown, through expressing the vector angular spectrum

of the electric ﬁeld of a 3D light beam in terms of its s and p polarization components, that

the IF eﬀect originates from a mechanism that is quite diﬀerent from that of the GH eﬀect.

This mechanism can be experimentally tested by the recently established technique [20, 21].

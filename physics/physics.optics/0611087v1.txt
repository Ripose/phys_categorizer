On the eﬀective permittivity of silver–insulator
nanocomposites

Abstract. The Bruggeman formalism provides an estimate of the eﬀective permittivity of
a composite material comprising two constituent materials, with each constituent material
being composed of electrically small particles. When one of the constituent materials is silver
and the other is an insulating material, the Bruggeman estimate of the eﬀective permittivity
of the composite exhibits resonances with respect to volume fraction that are not physically
plausible.

Keywords: Bruggeman formalism, negative permittivity, homogenization

INTRODUCTION

The estimation of the electromagnetic properties of homogenized composite materials (HCMs)
is a fundamental problem which has generated a vast literature, spanning 200 years [1].
Interest in this topic has escalated lately with the advent of metamaterials [2]; i.e., artiﬁcial
composite materials which exhibit properties either not exhibited at all by their constituents
or not exhibited to the same extent by their constituents [3]. In particular, metamaterials
in the form of nanocomposites — which are assemblies of disparate nanoparticles — present
exciting possibilities.

An important category of HCM is considered in this communication: that is, we consider
HCMs which arise from the homogenization of two isotropic dielectric constituent materials,
namely materials a and b with relative permittivities ǫa and ǫb, characterized by δ < 0, where∗

δ =

Re {ǫa}
Re {ǫb}

.

A recent study demonstrated that conventional homogenization formalisms, such as the
Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett formalisms, do not necessarily provide physically plausible
estimates of the HCM relative permittivity in the δ < 0 regime [4]. Furthermore, much–used

∗The operators Re { • } and Im { • } deliver the real and imaginary parts of their complex–valued argu-

ments.

bounds on the HCM relative permittivity, such as the Hashin–Shtrikman and Bergman–Milton
bounds, can become exceedingly large when δ < 0 [5].

Many metal–insulator HCMs of interest belong to the δ < 0 category, with silver often
being the constituent metal of choice. A key property of silver which is exploited by designers
of HCM–metamaterials is that its relative permittivity ǫAg is such that Re {ǫAg} < 0 but
Im {ǫAg} ≪ | Re {ǫAg} | at visible and near infrared wavelengths, as illustrated in Figure 1 by
the plots of measured values of Re {ǫAg} and Im {ǫAg} provided in [6]. Whereas the Brugge-
man homogenization formalism has been widely applied to estimate the relative permittivity
of silver–insulator HCMs [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], the inherent limitations of the Bruggeman
formalism in this particular δ < 0 scenario are not widely appreciated. Herein we highlight
the possible pitfalls of applying the Bruggeman homogenization formalism to silver–insulator
HCMs.

2 NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS

In the Bruggeman homogenization formalism, the constituent materials are treated symmet-
rically. As a consequence, this approach may be applied at arbitrary volume fractions, unlike
the Maxwell Garnett homogenization formalism which is restricted to dilute composites. A
rigorous basis for the Bruggeman formalism is developed within the framework of the strong–
permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) [14, 15]. The Bruggeman estimate of the relative
permittivity of the HCM, arising from the homogenization of the two constituent materials
described in §1, is provided implicitly as [16]

ǫBr =

faǫa (ǫb + 2ǫBr) + fbǫb (ǫa + 2ǫBr)
fa (ǫb + 2ǫBr) + fb (ǫa + 2ǫBr)

,

(2)

wherein fa and fb = 1 − fa are the respective volume fractions of the constituent materials a
and b. The particles of both constituent materials are assumed to be spherical and electrically
small. For example, at the (optical) wavelength of 600 nanometers, constituent particles of
less than 60 nanometers in radius are envisaged.

is straightforwardly extracted from (2). The choice of sign for the square root term in (3) is
dictated by the restriction Im {ǫBr} ≥ 0, as per the Kramers–Kronig relations [17].

Let ǫa = ǫAg, as given by the values displayed in Figure 1. For constituent material b
we choose silica with ǫb = 2.1, in keeping with several reported Bruggeman–based studies
[7, 8, 12, 13]. The real and imaginary parts of the Bruggeman estimate ǫBr are plotted
as functions of volume fraction fa in Figure 2. At the wavelengths λ0 = 397, 704 and 1393
nanometers considered in Figure 2, the corresponding values of ǫa are −4.3 + 0.2i, −23.4 + 0.4i
and −102.0+2.6i, respectively [6]. The distinct resonances exhibited by Im {ǫBr} with respect
to volume fraction, and the associated abrupt changes in gradient of Re {ǫBr}, are most
striking. The Im {ǫBr} resonance range is 0 / fa / 0.9 for λ0 = 397 nm, 0.1 / fa / 0.62 for
λ0 = 704 nm and 0.2 / fa / 0.47 for λ0 = 1393 nm. We observe that the maximum values of
Im {ǫBr} are an order of magnitude greater than the values of Im {ǫa} at the corresponding
wavelengths.

Figure 2: The Bruggeman estimate ǫBr of the relative permittivity for the HCM arising from
constituents with ǫa = ǫAg and ǫb = 2.1. Real (top) and imaginary (bottom) parts are plotted
against fa for λ0 = 1393 nm (red, dashed curve), λ0 = 704 nm (blue, broken dashed curve)
and λ0 = 397 nm (green, solid curve).

The question arises: does the resonant behaviour illustrated in Figure 2 represent a

physical process? To address this question, we repeat the calculations of Figure 2 using
Re {ǫa} = Re {ǫAg} but Im {ǫa} = 0. The corresponding Bruggeman estimates Im {ǫBr} are
graphed against volume fraction fa in Figure 3. It is clear from Figure 3 that the resonant be-
haviour illustrated in Figure 2 persists in an almost identical manner even when Im {ǫa} = 0.
In the case of Figure 3 both constituent materials are nondissipative, yet the Bruggeman
estimate of the HCM relative permittivity corresponds to a HCM which is strongly dissi-
pative in the regions of resonance. However, the Bruggeman homogenization formalism has
no mechanism for accommodating coherent scattering losses, unlike the SPFT which is its
natural generalization [15]. Therefore, we infer that the Bruggeman estimates in the regions
of resonance are not physically plausible.

3 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The Bruggeman estimate of the relative permittivity for a silver–insulator HCM — and,
by extension, the SPFT estimate [14, 15] — exhibits resonances with respect to volume
fraction which are not physically plausible. This point should be carefully borne in mind
when considering the eﬀective permittivity of silver–insulator nanocomposites. We note that
in two recent studies wherein the Bruggeman formalism was applied to estimate the relative
permittivity of silver–insulator HCMs, the resonance region was excluded from consideration
[12, 13].

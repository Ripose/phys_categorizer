Spatial Kerr solitons, typically associated with the standard paraxial nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, are shown to exist to all nonparaxial orders, as exact solutions of Maxwell’s equations in the
presence of vectorial Kerr eﬀect. More precisely, we prove the existence of azimuthally polarized,
spatial, dark soliton solutions of Maxwell’s equations, while exact linearly polarized (2+1)-D solitons
do not exist. Our ab initio approach predicts the existence of dark solitons up to an upper value
of the maximum ﬁeld amplitude, corresponding to a minimum soliton width of about one fourth of
the wavelength.

PACS numbers: 42.64.-K, 42.65.Tg, 42.81.Dp

Bright and dark optical spatial solitons have been and
still are the object of an intense theoretical and experi-
mental investigation.
[1, 2] In particular, Kerr solitons
have always represented the theoretical reference model
in view of the simplicity of their analytic description.
This is mainly due to the fact that they are solution of
an equation, the so-called nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion (NLS), which is exactly integrable and also admits,
in particular cases, of simple analytic solutions. The
main limit of the NLS is that it is only able to de-
scribe scalar optical propagation in the paraxial approx-
imation. Nonparaxial descriptions have been introduced
by adopting suitable asymptotic expansions in the small-
ness parameter λ/d (where d is the beam width) which
result in improved versions of NLS including both scalar
[3, 4, 5, 6] and vectorial [7, 8, 9] contributions. Besides
eliminating the unphysical catastrophic collapse associ-
ated with standard NLS [10, 11, 12], they show that the
transverse Cartesian components of (2+1)-D propagating
beams are mutually coupled, so that linearly polarized
(2+1)-D Kerr solitons cannot exist. The same nonparax-
ial approach can also be used to predict the existence of
(1+1)-D bright and dark solitons [13, 14], to the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant order in λ/d.

The standard or improved versions of the NLS are lim-
ited by the underlying approximation scheme and fail
whenever λ/d approaches one. The question naturally
arises: are there solitons to all nonparaxial orders? More

in general, is it possible to ﬁnd exact soliton solutions of
Maxwell equations?

In this paper we ﬁnd, by starting from Maxwell’s equa-
tions, that an exact solution (to all nonparaxial orders)
indeed exists in the form of an azimuthally polarized dark
soliton, i.e.

E(r, ϕ, z) = eiχzE(r)ˆeϕ,

where r, ϕ, z are cylindrical coordinates with unit vec-

are able to prove the existence of azimuthally polarized
dark solitons, i.e., of ﬁelds of the kind given in Eq.(1),
where E(r) monothonically ranges from E(0) = 0 to
E(
is a given real constant. We numer-
ically evaluate the soliton shape and its existence curve,
our results being obtained without any approximation, so
that the whole range of possible soliton widths is con-
sidered without any formal distinction between paraxial
and nonparaxial regimes. We note that the existence of
azimuthally polarized, circularly symmetric ﬁelds of the
form E(r, z)ˆeϕ, of which the soliton given in Eq.(1) is a
speciﬁc case, is due to the simple symmetry properties of
Kerr nonlinearity.

We note that circular symmetry and polarization im-

Both the structure of Eq.(10) and the azimuthal ﬁeld po-

Since focusing media (γ = 1, i.e., n2 > 0) are not able to

While positive and negative signs of α respectively refer

u(ρ) depends on α2 (see Eq.(10)) and is clearly the same

The magnetic ﬁeld has a radial component whose shape

Recent ﬁndings indicate that radially and azimuthally
polarized laser beams can be eﬃciently generated [16, 17]
and focused to subwavelength diameter [18] in resonator-
like schemes. These, combined with an appropriate non-
linear material can form a basis for a ﬁrst experimental
investigation of the existence of the azimuthally polarized
solitons. As an example, if we consider a strongly defo-
cusing nonlinear medium, like Sodium vapor at a density

In summary, we have found, to the best of our knowl-
edge, the ﬁrst exact, two-dimensional, dark spatial Kerr-
soliton. This soliton is obtained as a particular solution
of an equation (Eq.(8)), which in turn exactly follows
from Maxwell’s equations, describing circularly symmet-
ric, azimuthally polarized electric ﬁelds. Our ab initio
approach inherently overcomes any approximated scheme
employed to describe paraxial or slightly nonparaxial sit-
uations. In particular, the derived analytical expression
of the soliton propagation constant as a function of the

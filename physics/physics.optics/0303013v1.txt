Dependence of the bit-error-rate (BER) caused by ampliﬁer noise in a linear ﬁber optics line on
the ﬁber birefringence is investigated. We show that the probability distribution function (PDF)
of BER obtained by averaging over many realizations of birefringent disorder has an extended tail
corresponding to anomalously large values of BER. We speciﬁcally discuss dependence of the tail
on such details of pulse detection at the ﬁber output as “setting the clock” and ﬁltering procedures.

Transmission errors in modern optical telecommunica-
tion systems are caused by various impairments (limiting
factors). For systems with the rate 40 Gb/s or higher,
polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is one of the major
impairments. PMD leads to splitting and broadening an
initially compact pulse [1, 2, 3, 4]. The eﬀect is usually
characterized by the so-called PMD vector determining
the leading PMD distortion of the pulse [5, 6, 7].
It
is also recognized that the polarization vector does not
provide a complete description of the PMD phenomenon
and some proposals aiming to account for “higher-order”
PMD eﬀects have been recently discussed [8, 9, 10, 11].
Birefringent disorder is frozen (i.e. it does not change at
least on the time scales corresponding to the optical sig-
nal propagation). There is also a major impairement of
another kind, namely the noise originating from ampli-
ﬁed spontaneous emission. The ampliﬁer noise is short
correlated, i.e.
its temporal scale is short compared to
the signal width. In this letter we discuss the joint eﬀect
of the ampliﬁer noise and the birefringent disorder on
the BER. BER is an average over ampliﬁer noise depen-
dent on a current conﬁguration of the birefringent disor-
der. We focus on describing of such special conﬁgurations
of the ﬁber birefringence that produces an anomalously
large values of BER, and thus determines reliability of
the information transmission.

We propose a theoretical approach to the problem that
includes the following steps. Evaluation of the signal
BER due to the ampliﬁer noise for a given disorder real-
ization is a preliminary stage of our analysis. The major
object of our interest is the PDF of BER (its normalized
histogram) where the statistics is collected over diﬀerent
ﬁbers or over the states of a given ﬁber at diﬀerent times.
We calculate the probability of anomalously large BER.
In this letter we analyze the basic case (without compen-
sation) and compare it with the case when the simplest
compensation procedure called “setting the clock” is ap-
plied. More sophisticated compensation strategies will
be discussed elsewhere.

The envelope of the optical ﬁeld propagating in a given
channel in the linear regime (i.e. at relatively low pulse
intensity), which is subject to PMD distortion and am-
pliﬁer noise, satisﬁes the following equation [12, 13, 14]

Here z is the position along the ﬁber, t is the retarded

persion. The envelope Ψ is a two-component complex
ﬁeld where the two components represent two states of
the optical signal polarization. The birefringent disorder
is characterized by two random 2

ﬁelds related to the zero-, ˆ∆, and ﬁrst-, ˆm, orders in
frequency. Birefringence that aﬀects the light polariza-
tion is practically frozen (t-independent) on all the prop-

The additive noise, ξ, which is an ampliﬁcation left-
over, is zero in average. The statistics of ξ is Gaussian
with spectral properties determined solely by the ampli-
ﬁers’ steady state [15]. The noise correlation time is much
shorter than the signal duration, and therefore ξ can be
treated as δ-correlated in time. We analyze the case when
the pulse propagation distance substantially exceeds the
inter-ampliﬁer separation (the system consists of a large
number of spans) and consider quantities averaged over

distances larger than the the span length ls, so that the
ampliﬁer noise can be assumed to be short-correlated in
space. Summarizing, the Gaussian noise is completely
determined by its pair correlation function,

which is statistically independent of both d(z) and ˆm(z).
The matrix of birefringence ˆm can be parameterized
by a three component real ﬁeld hj, where ˆm =
hj ˆσj,
and ˆσj is the set of three Pauli matrices. The ﬁeld h is
zero in average and it is short-correlated in z. The above
ˆV ˆm ˆV −1 guarantees the statistics
transformation ˆm
of hj to be isotropic. Since h enters the observables de-
scribed by Eqs. (2,3) in an integral form the central limit
theorem (see, e.g., [16]) implies that the ﬁeld hj can be
treated as Gaussian ﬁeld described by the following pair
correlation function

where the average in Eq. (6) is taken over the birefringent
disorder realizations (corresponding to diﬀerent ﬁbers or
to the states of a single ﬁber taken at diﬀerent times).
If this birefringent disorder is weak the integral H =
Z
0 dz h(z) coincides with the PMD vector. (Here, Z is
the total length of the ﬁber.) Thus, and in agreement
R
with [5, 6, 7], 3DmZ measures the mean squared average
value of the PMD vector.

We consider the so-called return-to-zero (RZ) modula-
tion format when the pulses are well separated in t. The
signal detection at the line output, z = Z, corresponds
to measuring the pulse intensity, I,

where G(t) is a convolution of the electrical (current) ﬁl-
ter function with the sampling window function. The
linear operator
in Eq. (7) stands for an optical ﬁlter
and a variety of engineering “tricks” applied to the out-
put signal, Ψ (Z, t). Ideally, I takes two distinct values
corresponding to the bits “0” and “1”. However, the im-
pairments force deviations of I from the ideal values. To
detect the output signal one introduces some threshold
(decision level), I0, and declares that the signal codes
“1” if I > I0 and “0” otherwise. Sometimes the infor-
mation is lost, i.e. an initial “1” is detected as “0” at
the output or vise versa. The BER is the probability of

such an event which is measured averaging over many
pulses coming through a ﬁber with a given realization of
birefringent disorder, h(z). For successful system perfor-
mance the BER should be extremely small, i.e. typically
both impairments can cause only a small distortion of
a pulse. Based on Eq. (7) one concludes that the “0”
to “1” change from the input to the output is primarily
due to the noise-induced contribution φ and, therefore,
the probability of such event is insensitive to the birefrin-
gence disorder due to Eq. (5). Therefore, anomalously

B. Because of the smallness of the optical signal-to-noise
ratio (OSNR), B can be estimated using Eqs. (5,7) as
the probability of an optimal (saddle-point) ﬂuctuation
of φ leading to I < I0. One derives that the product
DξZ ln B depends on the disorder, the chromatic disper-
sion coeﬃcient and the measurement procedure (i.e. the
forms of Γ and
), while DξZ ln B is insensitive to the
noise characteristics.

Out of the variety of detection “tricks” we will dis-
cuss here only those correspondent to optical ﬁltering
and “setting the clock”.
(Other compensation options
will be considered elsewhere.) “Setting the clock” proce-
clΨ = Ψ (t
dure is formalized as,
tcl), where tcl is the
optimal time delay. Since DξZ is small even weak disor-
der could produce a large increase in the value of B. This
fact allows a perturbative evaluation of the ln(B/B0) de-
pendence on hj (where B0 is a typical value of B cor-
respondent to hj = 0). Thus, expanding the ordered
exponential (3) in the powers of h and retaining only
the leading term contributing to the expression for B,
one obtains ln(B/B0) = Γ/(DξZ). If no compensation is
applied Γ = µ1H3 + O(H 2), and the initial pulse Ψ0 is
assumed to be linearly polarized along (1, 0). Note that
= 0 due to ﬁltering.
even for a symmetric initial pulse µ1
“Setting the clock” compensation makes µ1 = 0 if tcl is
chosen to be exactly equal to H3. In this case and also
when the output signal is not chirped (this corresponds
to the case when there is no chirp in the initial signal and
Z
the integral value of chromatic dispersion,
0 dz d(z), is
negligible) one gets Γ = µ2(H 2

2 ) + O(H 3).

prime interest is ﬁnding the PDF tail correspondent to
the values of Hj essentially exceeding its typical value

Summarizing, our major result is the emergence of the
extremely long tail (10) in the PDF of BER. Note that
Eq. (10) shows a complex “interplay” of noise and disor-
der that may not be deduced from a naive “equal-footing”
estimate. Even though an extensive experimental (labo-
ratory and ﬁeld trial) of our analytical result would be of
a great value, some numerics, consistent with Eq. (10) is
already available. Thus, Fig. 2a of [17] replotted in log-
log variables shows the relation between ln S and ln B
close to linear, which is consistent with Eq. (10b). We
are going to analyze more complicated compensation pro-
cedures in our subsequent publications.

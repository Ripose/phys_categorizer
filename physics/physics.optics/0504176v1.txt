The transmission characteristics of commercial interference ﬁlters are not quite what we expected
from the speciﬁcations provided by manufacturers. The unexpectedly sharp dependences of the
transmission coeﬃcient on the incidence angle, wavelength, and on the position where the light beam
falls on the ﬁlter may be important in the analysis of systematic eﬀects in experiments incorporating
interference ﬁlters.

PACS numbers: 42.79.Ci

Despite its oﬃcial appearance, this is just an in-
formal write-up intended to summarize some obser-
vations that have surprised us (but perhaps should
not have). The book [1] provides an excellent discus-
sion of the theory and practice of interference ﬁlters;
however, it does not speciﬁcally mention the eﬀects
we observe.

The setup that we used for measuring the
transmission characteristics of interference ﬁlters is
straightforward. The light beam from a Spectra
Physics Model 117A He-Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm)
is attenuated with a color-glass plate (transmission
≈ 10%). It then passes through the interference ﬁl-
ter under investigation, which is mounted on a tilt
stage, in turn mounted on a multi-coordinate trans-
lation stage. The transmitted light intensity is mea-

FIG. 1: Experimental dependence of the transmitted
light intensity as a function of the tilt angle of the ﬁl-
ter with respect to the laser beam. In order to see the
details of the transmission dependence on the angle at
large angles where the transmission through the ﬁlter is
low, data were taken with the attenuator removed from
the beam path.

sured with a silicon photodiode.

Figure 1 shows the transmission through a 10-
nm bandpass ﬁlter with central wavelength 630 nm
(manufacturer unknown) as a function of the tilt an-
gle of the normal to the ﬁlter with respect to the
nominal direction of the laser beam. The colored
plate was positioned 1 cm away from the laser, the
interference ﬁlter was placed 5 cm from the plate,
and the photodiode was 4.5 cm after the ﬁlter. The
ﬁlter was rotated about an axis perpendicular to the
laser beam and measurements were made at 0.25-
degree intervals.

As expected, the transmission falls oﬀ as the tilt
angle becomes large. However, instead of the ex-
pected smooth dependence, we see that there is an
oscillating structure superimposed on the smooth
dependence with ∼ 10 periods over the transmis-
sion window. The oscillating structure comprises
∼ 15% near zero tilt angles, but its relative ampli-
tude increases as the overall transmission decreases.
At large tilt angles, the oscillation becomes an es-
sentially 100% eﬀect.
In order to see the large-
angle regions more clearly, we have also recorded
the transmission with the color-glass attenuator re-
moved (Fig. 1).

We have then looked at the spatial uniformity of
the transmission through the ﬁlter with a ﬁxed tilt
angle. This was done by moving the ﬁlter with a
ﬁxed tilt angle in a direction perpendicular to the
laser beam and monitoring transmission. As seen in
Fig. 2, we found that, indeed, the transmission is
strongly dependent on the position.

Next, we examine essentially the same eﬀects,
but in a slightly diﬀerent arrangement. The images
shown in Figs. 3 and 4 were produced by inserting
a diverging lens (f = −6 cm) 1 cm after the atten-
uator (between the attenuator and the interference
ﬁlter). The photodiode was replaced with a Coher-
ent LaserCam II CCD camera. The negative lens
converts the 1-mm diameter laser beam to a diverg-

the transmitted light intensity as a function of the ﬁlter
displacement in the direction perpendicular to the laser
beam. The normal to the ﬁlter is tilted by 8 degrees with
respect to the direction of the collimated laser beam (no
lens is used for this measurement).

ing beam with a diameter of 1.7 mm at the ﬁlter and
4.8 mm on the camera (with the ﬁlter removed). The
interference ﬁlter used to produce the set of images
in Fig. 3 is the same interference ﬁlter as was used
to produce the data of Fig. 1. The angular progres-
sion of the images shows two families of interference
fringes. The smaller-period fringes are separated by
roughly 50 microns while the larger fringe separa-
tion is on the order of a millimeter. Rotating the
interference ﬁlter about the axis deﬁned by the laser
beam, we see that the larger-period structure rotates
by the same angle as the ﬁlter, however, the smaller-
period fringes do not rotate. Figure 4 shows images
from a 630-nm interference ﬁlter made by Corion.
Again, the larger-period fringes rotated with the ﬁl-
ter, while the smaller-period fringes did not. We
have checked (by placing a linear polarizer in front
of the interference ﬁlter and rotating it around) that
the transmission pattern was not visibly aﬀected by
the direction of the light polarization.

The eﬀects described above seem to be rather uni-
versal. We have observed interference fringes quali-
tatively similar to the ones discussed above with sev-
eral ﬁlters at diﬀerent wavelengths with dye lasers
in the yellow-red and an Ag hollow-cathode lamp
emitting narrow resonance lines at 328 and 338 nm
as light sources.

Obviously, it is important for anyone who is work-
ing with interference ﬁlters and narrow-band light to
be aware of the transmission peculiarities such as the
ones described in this note. Clearly, the oscillations

ﬁlter (Corion) also centered at 630 nm. The tilt angles
are from 0 to 20 degrees with increment of 4 degrees.

such as the ones shown in Fig. 1 would also show
up in a plot of transmission vs. the wavelength for
monochromatic light. Yet, when a transmission plot
arrives with a newly-purchased ﬁlter (or when we
take the transmission curve ourselves using a scan-

ning spectrophotometer), oscillations are usually not
there. Probably, this is because the spectral window
of the spectrophotometer is broader than the char-
acteristic period of the oscillation, so the oscillations
average in the recorded spectrum.

Of course, it is not too surprising to see interfer-
ence eﬀects, albeit unwanted ones, in an interference
ﬁlter.
It would be interesting to apply thin-ﬁlm-
simulation software to model a speciﬁc ﬁlter to ﬁg-
ure out the exact origin of the observed eﬀects (and,
perhaps, ﬁgure out ways to eliminate them).

We have implemented a new approach for measuring the time-dependent intensity and phase of ultrashort
optical pulses. It is based on the interaction between shaped pulses and atoms, leading to coherent transients.

Complete pulse measurement is a central

issue to
most ultrashort experiments. This is the case both for
measuring the shortest “clean” pulses as well as com-
plex shapes produced by pulse shapers. The usual meth-
ods can be divided into self-referenced techniques (SPI-
DER, FROG or derivatives)1–3 and techniques compar-
ing the unknown pulse with a well-known one. In the
ﬁrst method, non-stationary ﬁlter or a non-linear inter-
action are required. In the second case, the unknown ﬁeld
is compared to a known reference ﬁeld. A spectacular
demonstration was achieved with attosecond pulses used
for direct light wave measurement.4 The method has a
linear sensitivity with respect to the unknown pulse, but
previous knowledge of the reference pulse can be a severe
constraint, particularly in examples such as spectral in-
terferometry where the reference pulse has similar char-
acteristics (same spectral range, and similar or broader
spectral width) as the unknown pulse.

We present in this letter a new approach to elec-
tric ﬁeld reconstruction based on an atomic response.
In this context, we regard the atomic system as a high
spectral resolution probe (compared to spectrometers
used in usual methods) of known response to a shaped
light ﬁeld. Contrary to most of the well-known cross-
correlation in gases which require no resonant relay-state
and leads to intensimetric cross-correlation (just as in
frequency mixing processes),5, 6 this method requires res-
onant bound states and leads to the product of the two
electric ﬁelds. It is based on a sequence of Coherent Tran-
sients (CT) measurements.7 These CT are oscillations
in the excited state population resulting from the inter-
action between a two-level system and a weak chirped
pulse. This scheme takes advantage of the high sensitiv-
ity of CT to the pulse shape, in particular, to spectral
phase eﬀects.8, 9 In this letter, this new method is ﬁrst
explained then experimental results are presented. Its
feasibility is illustrated by measuring glass material dis-
persion. The limits of the method and its implementation
are discussed.

The CT result from the interaction of a two-level sys-
tem (|gi and |ei) with a chirped pulse E(t) of carrier
angular frequency ω0 close to resonance (ω0 ≃ ωeg). The
transient excited state population is probed towards the

|f i level in real time by a second ultrashort pulse Eref (t)
which is Fourier transform limited and short compared to
the characteristic features of E(t). Its frequency is close
to resonance (ωf e). The ﬂuorescence arising from the |f i
state is then recorded as a function of the pump-probe
delay τ . The probe pulse provides access to the tempo-
ral evolution of the population in |ei, produced by the
pump beam. The result of the interaction is described
by ﬁrst order perturbation theory, and the ﬂuorescence
is proportional to

In the case of a simply chirped pulse E(t), a quadratic
phase appears in the integral giving ae(t) (Eq. 2), lead-
ing to oscillations of the probability |af (τ )|2 as al-
ready demonstrated.7, 8 These strong oscillations result
from interferences between the population amplitude ex-
cited at resonance and after resonance. They are ex-
tremely sensitive to tiny phase modiﬁcations.9 However,
although sensitive to phase eﬀects these CT give ac-
cess to the excited state probability |ae(τ )|2 whereas the
probability amplitude is necessary to achieve a complete
measurement of the electric ﬁeld. Moreover, the oscilla-
tions are only produced by the second part of the pulse
(after resonance).7

To overcome these limitations, a new excitation
scheme with two pump pulses is used. Two measure-
ments are performed, each with a two pulse sequence
with a well deﬁned phase relationship Eshaped(t) =
E1(t)+ eiθE2(t) where E1(t) and E2(t) are two replica of
the unknown pulse generated by splitting the same initial
pulse E(t) and adding additional spectral phase. These
can be obtained either with a Michelson-type interferom-
eter or with a pulse shaper. The ﬁrst pulse E1(t) creates
an initial population in the excited state. The second
pulse E2(t) is strongly chirped and suﬃciently delayed
by T so that it does not overlap with the ﬁrst pulse.

1

This second pulse creates a population in the excited
state which interferes with the initial population created
by the ﬁrst pulse. Thus, oscillations due to CT occur on
the whole duration of the second pulse. The ﬁnal state
population during the second pulse can be written as

|af,θ(τ )|2 =

|af,1(+∞)|2 can be obtained from the plateau reached
between the two pulses. The last two contributions in
Eq. 3 depend on τ and on the second pulse. For a sec-
ond pulse of smaller peak power, the crossed term is
dominant so that the response is mostly linear with
respect to the second pulse. A ﬁrst measurement for

E2(ω) can be deduced provided that the ref-

ing the extra phase added to generate the pulse sequence,
E(ω) and thus E(t) is obtained. Note that unlike conven-
tional interferometric methods, the reference-ﬁeld spec-

trum does not need to overlap that of the unknown ﬁeld.

Fig. 1. Set-up Principle: The unknown pulse is sent into
a pulse shaper programmed to generate a sequence of
two pulses. One FL, the second delayed and chirped. An
extra phase can be added. An optional glass rod is added
in the front of the set-up. The reference is a pulse shorter
than the unknown pulse. Inset: Excitation scheme.

To illustrate the method, an experiment has been per-
formed in an atomic Rb vapor (see Fig. 1). The Rb (5s
- 5p (P1/2)) transition (at 795 nm) is resonantly excited
with the pump pulse sequence. The transient excited
state population is probed “in real time” on the (5p -
(8s, 6d)) transitions with an ultrashort pulse produced

2

by a home-made NOPA (607 nm, 25 fs). The “unknown”
pulse E(t) has initially a duration of 130 fs and can
be aﬀected by dispersive materials to demonstrate the
measurement capabilities. A phase and amplitude 640
pixels LCD-SLM pulse shaper10 is used to generate the
pump pulse sequence by applying a complex transmis-
sion in the spectral domain:

where ω0 is the carrier frequency of the pump pulse. The
ﬁrst pulse in the pump sequence is identical to E(t). The
second one is strongly chirped with φ′′ = −2.105 fs2 in
order to produce CT, and delayed by φ′ = 6 ps. An extra
phase factor θ can be added.

In a ﬁrst experiment, E(t) is close to Fourier lim-
ited. Two recordings are performed for θ = θ0 and
θ = θ0 + π/2 (with θ0 ≃ −0.2π) as shown in Fig. 2a.
Combining these two measurements allows one to de-
termine in-phase and in-quadrature contributions from
E2(t), so that af,2(t) can be retrieved. The main diﬀer-
ence with previous experiments7, 8 is the preparation of
a coherent superposition of |ei and |gi by the ﬁrst pulse.
Then the second -strongly chirped- pulse produces large
oscillations during its whole duration. These oscillations
can be seen as beats between the atomic dipole (which
behaves as a local oscillator) and the electric ﬁeld from
the second pulse, as in heterodyne detection. By com-
bining the two measurements, it is therefore possible to
retrieve fully the temporal evolution of the excited state
probability amplitude due to the second pulse. Figure
2b displays the reconstructed excited state probability
amplitude in the complex plane. The expected Cornu
spiral7 is observed. E2(t) obtained by simple derivation
of ae,2(t), is displayed on Fig. 2c. The temporal ampli-
tude and phase are represented. As a comparison, the
exact theoretical temporal phase applied by the pulse
shaper is shown (dashed line) without any other adjust-
ment than the oﬀset. The agreement is excellent. The
quadratic phase added by the pulse shaper is perfectly
retrieved.

In a second set of experiments, the dispersion of a SF58
glass rod (φ′′ = 20492 fs2) inserted in the pump beam is
measured. CT are monitored with and without the rod
in the pump beam. This dispersion is suﬃciently small
so that E1(t) and E2(t) do not overlap. Experimental
results in the spectral domain are presented on Fig. 3.
Figure 3a shows the spectral phase of
E2(ω) with and
without the dispersive rod. Their diﬀerence is plotted on
Fig. 3b together with the value calculated from the rod
coeﬃcients. The agreement is excellent on the spectral
domain where the intensity (dashed line) is signiﬁcant.
We have thus demonstrated here the capabilities of
this method on a simple example. Its main advantage
is that the unknown and reference pulses need not have
any spectral overlap, thus the method may be easily ex-
tended to wavelength regions for which a local oscilla-
tor pulse is not usually available. This method provides

interferometric-like terms but the two spectral shears re-
move constraints of usual interferometric technics : same
spectral domain, interferometric control of delay, tempo-
ral step small enough to resolve fringes. Here the hetero-
dyne beating with the local oscillator provided by the
atom shifts the interferometric oscillations around zero
frequency which makes them much easier to measure.
The requirement of an atomic transition can be seen as
a constraint as compared to ”all optical” methods for
pulse measurements in the visible or near IR. However,
some complex pulse shapes (with holes or phase discon-
tinuities) are diﬃcult to measure with standard meth-
ods and the present one can be more appropriate (nu-
merical simulations are very encouraging). Moreover this
new method can present signiﬁcant advantages in other
spectral range (UV, mid-IR). The condition is to ﬁnd a
three-level system which allows a pump-probe scheme.
The pulse sequence could be implemented in a simpler
set-up using a modiﬁed Michelson interferometer instead
of the pulse shaper. The spectral resolution here is not
limited by that of the pulse shaper but only by the tem-
poral interval scanned and ultimately by the linewidth
of the atomic transition (typically 10−6), which could be

order of magnitude improvements with respect to other
methods based on a spectrometer. There is no intrinsic
limitation for the bandwidth or the central frequency of
the unknown pulse provided that a system with reso-
nant transitions exist in this range. The reference pulse
bandwidth should be as large as this of the unknown
pulse. We sincerely acknowledge Christophe Dorrer and
Manuel Joﬀre for fruitful discussions and advices.

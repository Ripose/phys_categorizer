Abstract

The Bruggeman formalism provides an estimate of the eﬀective permittivity of
a particulate composite medium comprising two component mediums. The Brugge-
man estimate is required to lie within the Wiener bounds and the Hashin–Shtrikman
bounds. Considering the homogenization of weakly dissipative component mediums
characterized by relative permittivities with real parts of opposite signs, we show that
the Bruggeman estimate may not be not physically reasonable when the component
mediums are weakly dissipative; furthermore, both the Wiener bounds and the Hashin–
Shtrikman bounds exhibit strong resonances.

Keywords: homogenization; negative permittivity; Bruggeman formalism; Maxwell Gar-
nett formalism; Hashin–Shtrikman bounds; Wiener bounds

1 Introduction

Metamaterials in the form of particulate composite mediums are currently of considerable
scientiﬁc and technological interest [1]. Provided that wavelengths are suﬃciently long com-
pared with the length scales of inhomogeneities, such a metamaterial may be envisaged as a
homogenized composite medium (HCM), arising from two homogeneous component mediums
[2, 3]. HCMs with especially interesting properties may be conceptualized if the real parts
of the relative permittivities (and/or relative permeabilities) of the two component mediums
have opposite signs [4]. This possibility arises for metal–in–insulator dielectric composites
[5, 6] and has recently become feasible with the fabrication of dielectric–magnetic materials
displaying a negative index of refraction in the microwave frequency range [7, 8].

Over many years, several theoretical formalisms have been developed in order to estimate
the eﬀective constitutive parameters of particulate composite mediums [2]. In particular, the
Maxwell Garnett and the Bruggeman homogenization formalisms have been widely used [9].
Generally, the Maxwell Garnett formalism is seen to hold only for dilute composite mediums
[10].3 More widely applicable is the Bruggeman formalism that was initially founded on
the intuition that the total polarization ﬁeld is zero throughout the HCM [16]. A rigorous
basis for the Bruggeman formalism is also available, within the framework of the strong–
permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) [17, 18].

Estimates of HCM constitutive parameters generated by homogenization formalisms may
be required to lie within certain bounds. In particular, the Wiener bounds [19, 20] and the
Hashin–Shtrikman bounds [21] are often invoked. The Hashin–Shtrikman bounds coincide
with the constitutive parameter estimates of the Maxwell Garnett homogenization formalism
[20]. The applicability of theoretical bounds on the HCM permittivity has recently been the
focus of attention for composites speciﬁed by relative permittivities with positive–valued real
parts [22].

In this communication, we consider the application of the Bruggeman formalism, together
with the Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, to isotropic dielectric HCMs which arise
from component mediums characterized by complex–valued relative permittivities whose real
parts have opposite signs. This is scenario is typical of metal–in–insulator HCMs [20, 23], for
example. By duality, our analysis extends to isotropic magnetic HCMs. It also extends to
isotropic dielectric–magnetic HCMs, because the permeability and the permittivity are then
independent of each other in the Bruggeman formalism [24] (as also in the Maxwell Garnett
formalism [25]). Therefore, our ﬁndings are very relevant to the application of homogeniza-
tion formalisms [4] to mediums displaying negative index of refraction [26], for example.
Furthermore, the implications of our mathematical study extend beyond the Bruggeman
formalism to the SPFT as well [3].

iωt) time–dependence is implicit in the following sections;

3The restriction on the applicability of the Maxwell Garnett formalism to dilute composite mediums
generally emerges from comparison with experimental data [9]. As the particulate volume fraction increases,
the distribution of particles begins to lose the randomness which is inherent to the theory of the Maxwell
Garnett formalism [11]. However, the restriction could be bypassed if the distribution of particles in a
composite medium continues to lack order even under densiﬁcation, which thought underlies the random
unit cell approach developed by Smith and colleagues [12, 13, 14]. An anonymous reviewer has suggested
that self–assembly techniques [15] can yield randomness even at large particulate volume fractions, and could
therefore extend the applicability of the Maxwell Garnett formalism.

wherein fa and fb are the respective volume fractions of component mediums a and b, and

2.2 Bounds on the HCM relative permittivity

Various bounds on the HCM relative permittivity have been developed. Two of the most
widely used are the Wiener bounds [19, 20]

and the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds [21]



While both the Wiener bounds and the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds were originally derived
for real–valued constitutive parameters, generalizations to complex–valued constitutive pa-
rameters have been established [23].

The Hashin–Shtrikman bound HSα is equivalent to the Maxwell Garnett estimate of
the HCM relative permittivity ǫMG
HCM/a based on spherical particles of component medium a
embedded in the host component medium b. Similarly, HSβ is equivalent to the Maxwell
Garnett estimate of the HCM relative permittivity ǫMG
HCM/b based on spherical particles of
component medium b embedded in the host component medium a. The estimate ǫMG
HCM/a is
valid for fa . 0.3, whereas the estimate ǫMG
HCM/b is valid for fb . 0.3; but see the footnote in
Section 1.

To gain insights into the asymptotic behaviour of the Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman
bounds, let us again restrict attention to the case of nondissipative component mediums
R). From (7), we see that Wβ remains ﬁnite for all values of δ, but Wα may
(i.e., ǫa,b ∈

3 Numerical results

Let us now present, calculated values of the HCM relative permittivity ǫBr
HCM, along with the
corresponding values of the bounds Wα,β and HSα,β, for some representative examples. Both
nondissipative and dissipative HCMs are considered for δ =

3.1 Nondissipative component mediums

The eﬀects of dissipation may be very clearly appreciated through ﬁrst considering the
idealized situation wherein the components mediums are nondissipative [27]. Furthermore,
although the absence of dissipation is unphysical due to the dictates of causality [28], weak
dissipation in a particular spectral regime is deﬁnitely possible and is then often ignored [9,
Sec.2.5].

Thus, it is instructive to begin with the commonplace scenario wherein both ǫa > 0 and
ǫb > 0. For example, let ǫa = 6 and ǫb = 2. In Figure 1, ǫBr
HCM is plotted against fa, along with
the corresponding Wiener bounds Wα,β and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα,β. The latter
bounds are stricter than the former bounds in the sense that

Wα < HSα < ǫBr

HCM < HSβ < Wβ.

HCM/a. Similarly, ǫBr
ǫMG

HCM and the lower Hashin–Shtrikman bound HSα at low
HCM agrees closely
ǫMG
HCM/b.

The close agreement between ǫBr
volume fractions fa is indicative of the fact that HSα ≡
with the upper Hashin–Shtrikman bound HSβ at high values of fa since HSβ ≡
A markedly diﬀerent situation develops if the real–valued ǫa and ǫb have opposite signs.
For example, the values of ǫBr
6 and ǫb = 2 are graphed against fa
HCM calculated for ǫa =
in Figure 2, together with the corresponding Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. The
Bruggeman estimate ǫBr
HCM is complex–valued with nonzero imaginary part for fa . 0.82.
This estimate is not physically reasonable. The Bruggeman homogenization formalism —
unlike the SPFT which is its natural generalization — has no mechanism for taking coherent
scattering losses into account. Furthermore, no account has been taken in the Bruggeman
equation (2) for the ﬁnite size of the particles [11, 29, 30]. Therefore, the Bruggeman estimate
of the HCM relative permittivity is required to be real–valued if the component mediums
are nondissipative.

3.2 Weakly dissipative component mediums

Let us now investigate ǫBr
dissipative; i.e., ǫa,b ∈

HCM and its associated bounds when the component mediums are
C. We begin with those cases for which δ > 0: for example, we take

5

ǫa = 6 + 0.3i and ǫb = 2 + 0.2i. In Figure 3, ǫBr
HCM is plotted against fa, and the associated
Wiener bounds Wα,β and the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα,β are also presented. The
behaviour of the real parts of ǫBr
HCM, Wα,β and HSα,β closely resembles that displayed in the
nondissipative example of Figure 1. In fact, the following generalization of (12) holds:

Re (Wα) < Re (HSα) < Re (ǫBr

HCM) < Re (HSβ) < Re (Wβ) .

(13)

Turning to the cases for δ < 0, we let ǫa =

However, this ordering (13) does not extend to the imaginary parts of ǫBr

HCM, Wα,β and HSα,β.
6 + 0.3i and ǫb = 2 + 0.2i, for example. The
corresponding Bruggeman estimate ǫBr
HCM is graphed as function of fa, along with the Wiener
bounds Wα,β and the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα,β in Figure 4. Since Im (ǫa,b)
= 0, the
real parts of Wα and HSα remain ﬁnite, unlike in the corresponding nondissipative scenario
presented in Figure 2.

−

4 (for Wα) and fa = 1

However, the real and imaginary parts of Wα and HSα exhibit strong resonances in the
vicinity of fa = 3
4 (for HSα). These resonances become considerably
more pronounced if the degree of dissipation exhibited by the component mediums is reduced.
For example, in Figure 5 the graphs corresponding to Figure 4 are reproduced for ǫa =

HCM vastly exceeds both the Wiener bounds Wα,β

fa . 0.8. Thus, the Bruggeman estimate ǫBr
and the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα,β for a wide range of fa. Since Im (ǫa,b)
estimates of Im(ǫBr

6 + 0.003i and ǫb = 2 + 0.002i. We observe in particular that Im (ǫBr

HCM) are clearly unreasonable.
Furthermore, since the real and imaginary parts of HSα ≡

ǫMG
HCM/a exhibit sharp resonances

at fa = 1

4, we may infer that the Maxwell Garnett formalism is inapplicable for δ < 0.

3.3 Highly dissipative component mediums

On comparing Figures 4 and 5, we conclude that the Bruggeman formalism, the Weiner
bounds and the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds become increasing inappropriate as the degree of
dissipation decreases towards zero. This means that all three could be applicable rather well
when the dissipation is not weak.

Therefore, let us examine the scenario wherein the real and imaginary parts of the rel-

take ǫa =

sented in Figure 6. The real and imaginary parts of the Bruggeman estimate are physically
plausible, and both lie within the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. The Hashin–Shtrikman bounds
themselves do not exhibit resonances, and the Weiner bounds do not exhibit strong reso-
nances. Accordingly, we conclude that many previously published results are not erroneous,
but caution is still advised.

4 Discussion

The Bruggeman homogenization formalism is well–established in the context of isotropic
dielectric HCMs, as well as more generally [2]. However, this formalism was shown in Sec-
tion 3.2 to be inapplicable for HCMs which arise from two isotropic dielectric component
mediums, characterized by relative permittivities ǫa and ǫb, with

(i) Re (ǫa) and Re (ǫb) having opposite signs; and

(ii)

Re (ǫa,b)

|

Im (ǫa,b)

.

|

| ≫ |

Since the Bruggeman formalism provides the comparison medium which underpins the SPFT,
it may be inferred that the SPFT is likewise not applicable to the scenarios of (i) with (ii).
It is also demonstrated in Section 3.2 that both the Wiener bounds and the Hashin–
Shtrikman bounds can exhibit strong resonances when the component mediums are charac-
terized by (i) with (ii). In the vicinity of resonances, these bounds clearly do not constitute
tight bounds on the HCM relative permittivity. As a direct consequence, the Maxwell Gar-
nett homogenization formalism, like the Bruggeman homogenization formalism, is inappli-
cable to the scenarios of (i) with (ii). This limitation also extends to the recently developed
incremental [31] and diﬀerential [32] variants of the Maxwell Garnett formalism.

If the component mediums are suﬃciently dissipative then the Bruggeman formalism and
the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds (and therefore also the Maxwell Garnett formalism) provide
physically plausible estimates, despite the real parts of the component medium relative
permittivities having opposite signs — as shown in Section 3.3. The explicit delineation of
the appropriate parameter range(s) for the Bruggeman formalism and the Hashin–Shtrikman
bounds is a matter for future investigation.

Bounds can, of course, be violated by a formalism if the underlying conditions for the
formalism are in conﬂict with those used for deriving the bounds. Sihvola [22] has catalogued
the following conﬂicts:

(a) Bounds derived for nondissipative component mediums can be invalid for the real parts
HCM/b for a composite medium containing dissipative component

HCM/a or ǫMG

of either ǫMG
mediums.

(b) Percolation cannot be cannot be captured by the Maxwell Garnett formalism [5, 33].
Hence, the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, being based on the Maxwell Garnett formalism,
can be violated by the Bruggeman estimate ǫBr
HCM for a percolative composite medium.

(c) The derivations of bounds generally assume that the particles in a composite medium
have simple shapes. If the particle shapes are complicated, the composite medium may
display properties not characteristic of the either of the component mediums. For in-
stance, magnetic properties can be displayed when the particles in a composite medium
have complex shapes [34, 35], even though the component mediums are nonmagnetic.
Clearly, the magnetic analogs of Wα, Wβ, HSα and HSβ are then inapplicable.

7

(d) Wα, Wβ, HSα, and HSβ as well as their magnetic analogs are also invalid prima facie

when the component mediums exhibit magnetoelectric properties [3, 11, 36].

(e) Bounds derived for electrically small particles become inapplicable with increasing
frequency, due to the emergence of ﬁnite–size eﬀects [29]. Even the concept of homog-
enization becomes questionable with increasing electrical size [2, p. xiii].

In contrast, the bounds and the homogenization formalisms studied in this paper share
the same premises; yet, a conﬂict arises in certain situations because the bounds exhibit
resonance while the homogenization estimates do not.

5 Concluding remarks

As several conventional approaches to homogenization are not appropriate to the HCMs
arising from component mediums characterized by (i) with (ii), there is a requirement for
new theoretical techniques to treat this case. This requirement is all the more pressing, given
the growing scientiﬁc and technological importance of new types of metamaterials [1, 26].

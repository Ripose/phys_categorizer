Abstract

The surface integral formalism is used here to derive the integral equations

for the scattering of diﬀusive waves, which are numerically solved without

approximations. The Extinction Theorem for diﬀusive waves is here intro-

duced to obtain the boundary values of both the wave photon density and the

current photon density. We ﬁnd that the diﬀusion equation that neglects the

spatial variation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient yields results that substantially

depart from the results that include this term. We present this theory and

apply it to the simulation of diﬀusive objects buried in diﬀusive media in the

presence of interfaces.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently there has been much interest on the scattering and propagation of diﬀusive

waves, due to its potential applications in medical diagnosis (see for example refs. [1], [2] and

references therein). Light traveling in turbid media may be described by transport theory

[3], and in the strong scattering regime it can be described by the diﬀusion approximation

[4]. Such is the case of breast and tumor tissues illuminated with light of wavelength in

the range of 650-1300nm (the so called spectral window, see ref. [2]). Several studies have

been made to determine the optical properties of diﬀusive media both in the frequency

and time domains, (see for example [6–9]), and for the detection and characterization of

objects in diﬀusive media [10–18], but none of them, to our knowledge, solves exactly the

propagation equations for multiply connected scattering domains taking into account the

surface contributions and the presence of contrast across them.

In this paper we present a frequency-domain theoretical study of the diﬀusion equation

in the case of multiply connected diﬀusive media. We formulate the scattering integral

equations [19] from ﬁrst principles, and in particular, the extinction theorem for scattered

diﬀusive scalar waves. We deal with a conﬁguration consisting of two diﬀusive media, sep-

arated by a plane interface, with a contrasted diﬀusive object immersed in one of them.

This may represent a reasonable model to in vivo experiments for detecting tumor tissue in

a breast covered by a diﬀusive solution such as Intralipid. In this manner, we could avoid

approximations involved in the boundary conditions [20] needed when illuminating from

non-diﬀusive media. For the sake of computing time and memory, we illustrate numerical

results in 2D conﬁgurations without loss of generality. We have studied how the presence

of an interface aﬀects both detection and contrast, and we have compared the results ob-

tained from the exact diﬀusion equation with those derived from the diﬀusion equation that

neglects the term related to the spatial variation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

II. DERIVATION OF THE SCATTERING EQUATIONS FOR DIFFUSIVE

On taking the Boltzmann transport equation and considering a dense medium in which

there is: quasi-isotropic angular photon ﬂux, an isotropic photon source, and the variations

in time of the photon current density J occur on a time scale much larger that the time

between photon collision with the scattering particles of the medium, one obtains the so-

called diﬀusion approximation for the total photon density φ(r, t) [4]:

∂φ(r, t)
∂t

+ ∇ · J(r, t) + vµa(r)φ(r, t) = q0(r, t),

In Eq.(1) v is the speed of light in the medium, q0 is the photon source term in photons

per second, and J(r, t) is the photon current density, given by Fick’s Law:

J(r, t) = −vD(r)∇φ(r, t).

In order to follow the notation used in [4], in Eq.(2) we have deﬁned the diﬀusion constant

as D(r) = 1/3[µa(r) + µ′

s(r)], but other authors deﬁne it as 1/[3µ′

s(r)] (see [5]). In any case

this does not aﬀect our study, and the resulting integral equations are the same in both

cases. µ′

s [deﬁned as (1 − g)µs, g being the average cosine of the scattering angle] is the

transport scattering coeﬃcient, and µa is the absorption coeﬃcient of the medium. Both µ′
s

and µa are time independent. The diﬀusion equation, after substituting q0/v by S0, can be

rewritten as:

− ∇ · [D(r)∇φ(r, t)] + µa(r)φ(r, t) = S0(r, t).

Eq.(3) is valid at distances from boundaries and sources much larger than the transport

Assuming that the photon source is modulated by a frequency ω, i.e. S0(r, t) = S0(r) ·

DC contribution (ω = 0), we can express the diﬀusion equation in the frequency regime as:

where we have expressed the complex diﬀusion wave number as:

It is useful to express Eq.(4) by writing κ(r) as a constant complex wave number plus

an r- dependent variation, i.e κ2(r) = κ2

D(r)

· ∇φ(r)

to the source term in the right hand side.

In this way, we can proceed with the Green

function corresponding to Helmholtz’s equation for a medium with a constant complex wave

number κ0. Let us consider a diﬀusive inhomogeneous medium of volume V embedded in

an isotropic and homogeneous diﬀusive medium of volume ˜V in which the parameters are

κ0, D0 and µa0 constant. Then, ∆κ2(r) and D(r) will be deﬁned as:

D0

r ∈ ˜V

D1(r) r ∈ V

r ∈ ˜V

0 − κ2

1(r) r ∈ V

D(r) = 

∆κ2(r) = 




Notice that ∆κ2(r) is the equivalent to the scattering potential as deﬁned in potential

scattering theory.

The diﬀusion equation can therefore be expressed as:

∇2φ(r) + κ2

0φ(r) = −

+ ∆κ2(r)φ(r) −

∇φ(r),

S0(r)

and the Green’s function corresponding to this equation satisﬁes:

∇2G(κ0|r, r′|) + κ2

0G(κ0|r, r′|) = −4πδ(r − r′).

By multiplying Eq.(6) by G, Eq.(7) by φ, subtracting both, performing a volume integral

and applying Green’s theorem,

v(U∇2G − G∇2U)d3r =

In Eqs.(8) and (9) ˜S and S denote the surface delimiting volumes ˜V and V , respectively.

The values of ∇D in volumes ˜V and V have a discontinuity across ˜S and S, respectively.

We have included in Eqs.(8) and (9) an inﬁnitesimal volume δV so that:

If we characterize surface S by the vector s, the saltus conditions across S that separates

In Eqs.(10) and (11) we have written the integration of ∇D as the sum of its surface and

volume contributions (a procedure also done in [21]). The surface contribution in Eq.(10)

is the integration over the surface S(+) separating the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous

medium approached from the side of ˜V . The volume contribution to Eq.(10) is zero since

the medium in ˜V is homogeneous. Similarly, the surface contribution in Eq.(11) is the

integration over S(−), which is the surface separating V and ˜V approached from V . The

volume contribution is the integration over V.

We can express the diﬀerent contributions of the surface ˜S to the surface integral in

Eq.(8) as:

S, and in Eqs. (15) and (16) the integral over Vin is zero. Then, it is more convenient

to present the scattering integral equations as a combination of two sets: one deﬁning the

diﬀusive wave at the outside medium (φ+) and the other deﬁning the diﬀusive wave inside

the object (φ−).

for Eqs.(6) and (7) in our sets of Eqs.(19)-(20), we obtain similar integral equations as in

Eqs.(13)-(16). Since we have the system over-determined (we have more equations than

ceeding in this manner we obtain the following set of coupled integral equations:

in which there is contrast in D. This has already been accounted for by some authors (see for

example Refs. [8], [11], and [22]), where the problem is addressed by a perturbation method.

This was also taken into account in Ref. [6], and also in studies regarding the diﬀusion of

light in nematic liquid crystals, (see Refs. [23], [24] for example).

III. MULTIPLY CONNECTED SCATTERING DOMAINS

In order to study the propagation of diﬀusive waves in inhomogeneous media we have

taken into consideration a two dimensional conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 1. It consists

of a ﬂat interface at z = z0 that separates a semi-inﬁnite diﬀusive medium Vout[z > z0],

characterized by a linear, spatially uniform and isotropic diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dout, and

absorption coeﬃcient µaout, from a semi-inﬁnite diﬀusive medium Vin[z < z0] with a linear,

spatially uniform and isotropic diﬀusion coeﬃcient Din, and absorption coeﬃcient µain. A

cylinder of radius R, diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dcyl, absorption coeﬃcient µacyl and axis along

OY is immersed in Vin. A point source is placed in the upper medium z > z0 at point r0,

its intensity being sinusoidally modulated at frequency ω. Considering these three diﬀusive

media, imposing ﬂux continuity and conservation of the total photon current across their

common boundaries, we have the following saltus conditions:

G(κout|r − r0|) represents a damped cylindrical wave with its

origin at r0, and κout, κin and κcyl are the complex constant wave numbers corresponding

to Vout, Vin and Vcyl, respectively. In the two dimensional geometry under consideration, the

Green functions G(κα|r − r′|) are given by the zeroth-order Hankel function of the ﬁrst kind:

G(κα|r − r′|) = πiH (1)

0 (κα|r − r′|).

The new set of Eqs. (32)-(37) enable us to obtain the solution for the scattering of a

diﬀusive wave, which we shall deﬁne as: φ(total) = φ(inc) + φ(sc), where φ(inc) and φ(sc) are

12

the incident and scattered photon density waves, respectively. We shall study separately

the scattered amplitude |φ(sc)(r)| and the phase ∆(r), i.e. φ(sc)(r) = |φ(sc)(r)| exp i∆(r). In

order to obtain the numerical solution for this set of equations we have employed a numerical

procedure as in references [25]- [27].

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Following experimental procedures (see for example [15] and [28]), we have considered a

source with a modulation frequency ω = 200MHz, of wavelength 780 nm. The parameters

chosen for the three media Vout, Vin and Vcyl, are: Medium outside, an intralipid solution

as used in [15], i.e. µaout = 0.02cm−1 and Dout = 0.03333cm. Medium inside, breast

tissue, as deﬁned in [2] i.e. µain = 0.035cm−1 and Din = 0.0221705cm. Finally, we have

used the parameters of a simulated breast tumor, as described in [16], for the cylinder,

µacyl = 0.24cm−1 and Dcyl = 0.032552cm. In order to reach numerical convergence, we have

used a discretization dx = 0.015cm for an interface of length 8cm and ds = 0.004cm for the

cylinder. In those cases in which the presence of an object immersed in a diﬀusive medium

is studied, without any interface present, we shall use the parameters of breast tissue for

the outside medium and the parameters of the tumor tissue for the object. When studying

small objects, we must always take into consideration that, for the diﬀusion approximation

to remain valid, light must travel at least a few mean free paths. As stated in Ref. [29],

on comparing with a MonteCarlo result, sizes smaller than, or equal to the mean free path

start causing deviations. In our case, this would occur when R ≤ 1/µ′

s, R being the radius.

We have kept ourselves in this limit, and our objects are of sizes of the order of twice the

mean free path.

A. Detection of a Hidden Object. ”Complete” versus ”Approximated” Diﬀusion

Solution

In order to obtain an idea of the eﬀect that neglecting the ∇D term has on the total

amplitude, we have plotted in Figure 2 the variation of the total measured amplitude as

we move along a straight line that joins the source with the center of the cylinder, while

keeping the point source in a ﬁxed position. Clearer results are obtained on multiplying

this amplitude by the distance source-detector. From now on we shall call ”approximate”

results those obtained from neglecting the ∇D discontinuity at the boundaries, and we shall

call ”complete” solution those including this term. We have simulated this measurement

both in the presence and without interface, and, as can be seen in Fig. 2, at points near the

boundaries the departure between both solutions can be of the order of 25%. This error, of

course, depends on the diﬀusion contrast between volumes. We have not represented in Fig.

2 the variation when we place the detector behind the source because at those points the

scattered wave is negligible compared to the incident density wave, and therefore φ(out) ≃

φ(inc). It is very important to state at this point that at large distances from the objects (i.e.

many times the scattering mean free path) the complete and approximate wave amplitudes

behave qualitatively the same. We believe that this is why experiments performed at large

distances from objects match so well with the approximated diﬀusion equation solution. To

obtain an idea of the eﬀect that the contrast between diﬀusive constants has on the scattered

photon density waves, we present in Figures 3a and 3b the same type of measurements as

before, but now without any interface between medium 1 and 2, for objects with diﬀerent

diﬀusive constants, and therefore with diﬀerent contrasts. The parameters chosen in these

ﬁgures correspond to breast tissue for the outside medium and to the absorptivity of the

tumor tissue for the object, of which we only change its diﬀusion constant. As can be seen on

comparing the ”complete”(Fig. 3a) and ”approximate” (Fig. 3b) results, the ∆D term has

the eﬀect of greatly increasing the photon density amplitude near the object boundaries. In

order to represent this eﬀect, we have plotted in Figures 4a and 4b the same conﬁgurations,

14

but now normalized to the photon density that would be obtained in the absence of object.

As seen, the ”approximate” and ”complete” results greatly diﬀer from each other in the

proximities of the object.

In Figures 5a and 5b we represent the results for the relative

phase, i.e ∆ − ∆(no−object), for the same conﬁgurations. As can be seen in Figures 5a and

5b, there is a greater diﬀerence in phase when considering the ”complete” equation than

when taking the ”approximated” equation, in some points in the order of 60%, and also,

diﬀerences in shape can also be appreciated.

In order to study how the presence of an object immersed in the semi-inﬁnite medium

aﬀects the scattered photon density wave, we have performed a scan by ﬁxing the source at

rsource = (0, zsource) and moving the detector at a constant distance from the interface, i.e.

at rdetector = (x, zdetector). Only the scattered wave, i.e. φ(sc) = φ(total) − φ(inc) is evaluated.

We have performed these calculations using the intralipid constants for the outside medium,

and they are represented in Figures 6a and 7b for the ”complete” and ”approximated”

solutions, respectively. As seen from these ﬁgures, both results diﬀer, not only in magnitude

(the scattered amplitude for the ”complete” result is approximately three times greater than

in the ”approximate” case), but also in shape. From Fig. 6b, we infer that by neglecting

the ∇D term, one overestimates the inﬂuence that the presence of the cylinder has on

the shape of the scattered amplitude, and thus one would predict an easier detection and

characterization, which, if we compare with Fig. 6a, is not so straight-forward as predicted

by the exact case. We ﬁnd that, due to the contribution of the term of diﬀusive contrast

between the Intralipid solution and the breast, the presence of the object is masked in greater

manner. This eﬀect of course, diminishes as we approach the case in which Din/Dout = 1.

Since so far, we have not seen any experiments which model this situation, that is, an object

buried in a medium in the presence of an interface, it is not yet possible to make comparisons

with experimental data.

We have found that, performing a scan by moving both the detector and the source

at a constant distance from the surface, greatly increases the eﬀect that the presence of

the buried object has on the scattered photon density wave. In Fig. 7a and 7b we show,

15

for diﬀerent cylinder positions, the relative scattered phase, i.e ∆(sc) − ∆(sc)

(no−object), and the

relative scattered amplitude, |φ(sc)

(relative)| =

, where ∆(sc)

no−object and |φ(sc)

no−object| are

|φ(sc)|
(no−object)|

|φ(sc)

the phase and amplitude, respectively, of the photon density wave scattered when no object

is present, both obtained from the ”complete” diﬀusion equation. For the sake of brevity,

the results for these measurements on applying the ”approximate” diﬀusion equation are not

shown because they constitute no additional information, the reason being that qualitatively

these results are the same as the ”complete” ones, even though they vary in magnitude. As

said before, the eﬀect that the object has on the ”complete” scattered amplitude is greatly

masked by the contrast between the interface and the outside medium, and thus, the results

for the ”approximate” diﬀusion equation present a greater variation in amplitude when they

are represented as in Figures 7a and 7b.

As can be seen in Fig. 7a, a diﬀerence of at least 0.25 degrees in the relative scattered

phase can be produced by the presence of a cylinder of radius 1mm at a distance of 10mm.

By performing the scan as in Figures. 6a and 6b, i.e. moving the detector with the source

ﬁxed, a cylinder with such a radius buried at 10mm would produce no noticeable diﬀerence

in the wave scattered by the interface alone. It is quite interesting to see that, if we bury

the cylinder at a depth greater that ≃ 1cm, we ﬁnd constructive interference and therefore

obtain a greater amplitude in the presence of the object than in its absence. This eﬀect can

be seen in ﬁgure 8b, and even though it may not be possible to measure experimentally due

to its very small contribution (it produces a change in amplitude of 0.03%), it demonstrates

that the minimum obtained in ﬁgures 7a and 7b is due not only to absorption, but also to

destructive interference.

We have developed a method to solve numerically the diﬀusion equation in the presence of

bodies of arbitrary shape without any approximation whatsoever (although, of course within

the diﬀusion approximation context, that is). We have presented the scattering integral

V. CONCLUSIONS

16

equations for diﬀusive media, which are the equivalent to the scattering integral equations

for both scalar and electromagnetic ﬁelds in potential scattering, and the Extinction Theorem

for Diﬀusive Waves which constitutes a boundary condition for ﬁnding the sources, and have

solved such equations for multiply connected volumes. We have found that, neglecting the

∇D term in the diﬀusion equation, does not modify qualitatively the results of measures at

large distances from the boundaries, (large distances meaning those distances much larger

than the mean free path), but greatly modiﬁes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the

results when measuring at distances from boundaries of the order of a few mean free paths or

less. Depending on the contrast between diﬀusion constants, the eﬀect that this term has on

the amplitude scattered from an object in the presence of an interface, can greatly mask the

object contribution and thus make its detection and characterization more complicated. On

the other hand, when there is no interface present, the ∇D term has the eﬀect of increasing

the relative photon density near its boundaries and therefore makes detection of a single

object easier than predicted by the ”approximated” diﬀusion equation solution.

We have found that even in the presence of an interface, detection of very small (∼ 1mm)

objects is possible in the frequency regime by simultaneously scanning moving both detector

and source, and thus measuring the relative amplitude and phase.

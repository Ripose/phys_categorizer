Abstract

A new numerical method is developed for solution of the Gel’fand
– Levitan – Marchenko inverse scattering integral equations. The
method is based on the fast inversion procedure of a Toeplitz Hermi-
tian matrix and special bordering technique. The method is highly
competitive with the known discrete layer peeling method in speed
and exceeds it noticeably in accuracy at high reﬂectance.

1 Introduction

Promising technological applications of ﬁber Bragg gratings (FBG) [1] stimu-
late research and development of numerical methods of their synthesis. The
propagation of counter-directional waves in single-mode ﬁber with quasi-
sinusoidal refractive index modulation is described by coupled wave diﬀer-
ential equations [2]. Calculation of reﬂection coeﬃcient r(ω) from given co-
ordinate dependence of the refractive index is the direct scattering problem.
The inverse scattering problem consists in recovery of the refractive index
from given frequency dependence of the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(ω). In math-
ematical physics the inverse problem for coupled wave equations reduces to

1

coupled Gel’fand – Levitan – Marchenko (GLM) integral equations [3]. How-
ever, the straightforward numerical solution of the GLM equations is usually
considered as too complicated for practical FBG synthesis. At ﬁrst sight it
requires N 4 operations, where N is the number of discrete points along the
grating.

Since, the solution of integral equations seems to be ineﬃcient, other nu-
merical methods of FBG synthesis are elaborated.
In particular, iterative
methods with lN 3 operations are widespread, where l is the number of it-
erations necessary for convergence. For instance, they are successive kernel
approximations by Frangos and Jaggard [4], high-order Born approximations
by Peral et al [5] or advanced algorithm by Poladian [6] which uses infor-
mation about the reﬂection characteristics from both ends of the grating.
Sometimes additional approximations are applied. For example, Song and
Shin [7] approximate the reﬂection spectrum by a rational function or Ah-
mad and Razzagh [8] approximate the kernel function of integral equations
by polynomials.

The alternative approach is the layer peeling method known from quan-
tum mechanics and geophysics and applied for FBG synthesis by Feced et
al [9], Poladian [10] and Skaar et al [11]. The method has a clear physical
interpretation of the reﬂected signal as a superposition of impulse responses
from diﬀerent uniform layers or point reﬂectors placed along the grating.
Each thin layer has small reﬂectivity and can be taken into account within
the ﬁrst Born approximation. Because of high eﬃciency (of the order of N 2
operations) this method becomes widely used. The disadvantage of conven-
tional layer peeling is the exponential decay of accuracy along the grating
because of error accumulation during the reconstruction process [12]. The
comparable eﬃciency N 2 was demonstrated by Xiao and Yashiro [13] who
transformed the GLM integral equations to hyperbolic set of partial diﬀer-
ential equations and solved it numerically. This approach have several mod-
iﬁcations, in particular, Papachristos and Frangos [14] came to second-order
partial diﬀerential equations and also solved them numerically.

Better results at high reﬂectance are demonstrated by combination of
the iterations and the layer peeling. It is the integral layer peeling method
proposed by Rosenthal and Horowitz [15]. The grating is divided into thin
layers, but layers are not assumed to have uniform proﬁle. The proﬁle of
each layer is found by iterative solution of GLM equations.

A recent attempt of straightforward numerical solution was made in [16].
The GLM equations was solved with the help of a bordering procedure and

2

Cholesky decomposition. This approach takes of the order of N 3 operations.
The aim of present paper is to propose more eﬃcient numerical algorithm
with O(N 2) operations. The improvement is possible due to speciﬁc symme-
try of the matrix in the discrete GLM equations, the Toeplitz symmetry: the
elements of any one diagonal are the same. The Toeplitz symmetry leads to
considerable decrease in the number of operations, similar to the fast algo-
rithms by Levinson [17], Trench [18] and Zohar [19]. The proposed method
utilizes a modiﬁed bordering procedure and a second-order approximation of
integrands, the Hermitian symmetry is also taken into account.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 the GLM equations are re-
duced to convenient form for numerical calculation. The algorithm based on
the speciﬁc “inner-bordering” technique and Toeplitz symmetry is described
in Sec. 3. Testing numerical calculations and their comparison with the gen-
eralized hyperbolic secant (GHS) exactly solvable proﬁle and discrete layer
peeling (DLP) results are summarized in Sec. 4.

Let us consider the propagation of light through a grating with refractive
index n + δn(x) consisting of homogeneous background n = const and weak
modulation δn

n. The refractive index modulation is quasi-sinusoidal

≪

δn(x)/n = 2α(x) cos (κx + θ(x)) ,

where κ is the spatial frequency, α(x) is the apodization function [2] and θ(x)
is the phase modulation that describes the chirp of the grating, variation of
its spatial frequency. These functions are supposed to be slow-varying, that

The inverse problem for coupled wave equations was studied by Zakharov
and Shabat [3], see also [7]. The problem was reduced to the Gelfand —

resulting in Toeplitz symmetry of the matrix obtained by discretization of

For numerical solution of Eq.

Divide interval 0 6 τ 6 2L, where function R(τ ) is known, by segments of
length h = 2L/N. Introduce the discrete variables τn, sk, xm in accordance

Matrix R† is the upper triangular Toeplitz m
m matrix, that is Hermitian
conjugate to matrix R. Block matrix G(m) is also Toeplitz and Hermitian.
The solution of the algebraic set (10) can be found by the inversion of
matrix G(m) using, for example, the Levinson bordering algorithm [17]. How-
ever, we should fulﬁll much simpler task of ﬁnding complex mode coupling
coeﬃcient q(m) with the help of (9) which requires only the lower element
of vector w(m)
2m = v(m)
m to be known. Then the lower row of inverse matrix
−1
G(m)
is interesting for us ﬁrst of all. It is known that the inverse ma-
trix to Toeplitz matrix is generally not Toeplitz, but it is persymmetric, i.e.,
(cid:0)
symmetric with respect to the secondary diagonal [20]. Therefore, its lower
row is the reﬂection of its left column

with respect to its secondary diagonal. The left column in its turn satisﬁes
the relation

G(m)f (m) =

(13)

The vector-column in the right hand side of (13) is the ﬁrst column of the
identity matrix 2m

2m.

Let us also account for the Hermitian symmetry of matrix G(m). As
known, the matrix inverse to Hermitian is also Hermitian. Owing to persym-
metry and hermicity of inverse matrix its right column is

Tilde denotes hereafter the inverted numeration of components along with
the complex conjugation. The right column of the inverse matrix satisﬁes
the relation

G(m)˜f (m) =

(14)

The last column of the identity matrix enters the right hand side.

Since the unknown vector w(m) is formed from two vectors of dimension
m, it is convenient for us to present the left column of the inverse matrix
f (m) as a merging of two vectors of dimension m:

The same relations, (13) and (14), are valid for left column f (m+1) and
at the next (m + 1)-th

Similar to Levinson’s algorithm [17], vectors y(m+1) and z(m+1) at the next
(m + 1)-th step can be found by means of a bordering procedure from the

Note that the compound structure of the vectors is just what makes the bor-
dering procedure “inner”, since extending vectors y(m), z(m) by zeros means
inserting of two rows and two columns into matrix G(m) with one row and
one column placed in the middle of the matrix. At the ﬁrst step we ﬁnd from

Actually, the last convolution is excessive, since relation q(m+1) = 2β(m+1)/h

holds. Thus, the number of arithmetic operations at each (m + 1)-th step is
of the order of m. Then the total number of required operations is N 2 which
is approximately the same as in DLP method.

A great advantage of the new algorithm appears when we use the trape-
zoidal rule [21], i.e., the piecewise linear approximation of functions. The
equations in this case remain unchanged except of the right-hand side in (8)
(Rn + Rn−1)/2 and the main diagonal of matrix
that should be replaced by
R in (12) that should be given with weight 1/2.

Since the new procedure is based on Toeplitz symmetry of the matrix and
the speciﬁc procedure putting a column and a row inside the matrix, we call
it Toeplitz inner bordering (TIB) method.

N, in particular,
accuracy for the second-order method we choose Nω ≫
Nω = 220 at N = 212. It does not signiﬁcantly increase the total number of
operations, since the Fourier transform requires Nω log2 Nω operations and
done only once.

The inaccuracy of rectangular and that of trapezoidal quadrature formu-
las are compared. Root mean square error σ of the grating reconstruction is
shown in Fig. 3 as a function of 1/N. As evident from the ﬁgure the ﬁrst
and second-order algorithms result in diﬀerent errors. For the ﬁrst-order
method the dependence is linear, whereas for the second order it becomes
nearly quadratic. The slopes of ﬁtted straight lines are 1.05 and 2.00, respec-
tively. Moreover, the error of the second order method is signiﬁcantly less at
N > 26. Then the second-order method is applied in all calculations below.
The comparison of the second-order TIB with DLP reconstruction at
ﬁxed N reveals that TIB method occurs 2
3 times faster. The apodization

asymptotes of analytical expression (21) is reproduced by TIB calculation

5 Discussion

The discrete layer peeling [11] calculates q at the input end of the grating
and then truncates the grating dealing every next step with shorter grating
residue. This is the reason of error accumulation throughout the calculation
from the input layer to the output one. The TIB method of matrix inversion
recovers the complex coupling coeﬃcient q(x) along the whole length at one
step. Then it has higher accuracy at comparable eﬃciency.

It is possible to make TIB even more eﬃcient dividing the length L by
segments. After reconstruction of the coupling coeﬃcient in the current
segment one could ﬁnd the amplitudes of opposite waves at the input end
of the next segment and repeat the procedure with the next segment. The
eﬃciency could be improved if we choose the optimal number of segments.

The similar combined procedure with indirect iterative solution of GLM
equations, known as integral layer peeling (ILP), leads to fast reconstruction
of a grating [15]. In that approach the grating is divided by M layers with m
intermediate points in each. The total number of points along the grating is
N = mM. The reconstruction problem in each layer is solved by an iterative
procedure applied to GLM integral equations. The reﬂection coeﬃcient of
truncated grating after a peeling step is found with high accuracy. The

required operations [15], where l is the number of iterations during the recon-
struction of a layer. At l = 0 and large m the complexity becomes less than
N 2. However with increasing m and decreasing l the accuracy goes down
fast.

If we were change the ILP iterations by the proposed TIB technique the
complexity of the reconstruction within a layer would be N ln N + m2. We
obtain the total number of required operations multiplying it by M = N/m:

For very strong gratings at 1

| →
since an eigenvalue of GLM equations tends to zero and the problem becomes
ill-conditioned. If the grating is strong, then incident light is reﬂected in the
domain close to the input end. Only exponentially small part penetrates far
from the input end, then it is almost impossible to reconstruct the proﬁle
of the deeper region. Fortunately, it is a formal mathematical problem.
For more or less reasonable optical density, for instance, with maximum
reﬂectance up to 99.9%, the proposed TIB method is adequately accurate.

6 Conclusions

Thus the new method of the FBG synthesis is proposed. The method is
based on direct numerical solution of the coupled GLM equations. The
Toeplitz symmetry of the matrix and the inner-bordering procedure provide
fast computation, similar to known fast Levinson’s algorithm. The second-
order quadrature formula suﬃciently improves the accuracy without loss of
eﬃciency. The method is tested using exactly solvable proﬁle of chirped grat-
ing. The method does not concede the DLP in speed and at the same time
remains more accurate for strong gratings.

(Dated: January 10, 2014)

Soliton propagation is usually described in the “slowly varying envelope approximation” (SVEA) regime,
which is not applicable for ultrashort pulses. We present theoretical results and numerical simulations for both
NLS and parametric (c (2)) ultrashort solitons in the “generalised few-cycle envelope approximation” (GFEA)
regime, demonstrating their altered propagation.

II. NLS SOLITONS

I.

INTRODUCTION

This paper demonstrates the behavior of both Kerr and
parametric solitons in the few-cycle regime. We compare the
usual “many cycle” or “narrowband” Slowly Varying Enve-
lope Approximation” (SVEA) descriptions to those obtained
with the more accurate “Generalised Few-cycle Envelope Ap-
proximation” (GFEA) theory. We present a range of results
using both analytic and numerical methods.

There have been many suggestions for using solitons in
communications as well as optical logic (see e.g. [1, 2, 3]).
These generally emphasise the stability of soliton proﬁles over
long propagation distances, and the potential for higher data
rates with shorter solitons [4, 5]. It is clear that the applica-
bility of the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation to Kerr
soliton propagation is only valid in the SVEA regime, where
the soliton pulse contains many optical cycles. However, since
the shorter the pulse, the fewer optical cycles it contains, the
drive to ultrashort solitons will eventually reach the few-cycle
regime.

We discuss the change in propagation properties of few-
cycle solitons when the GFEA theory is used. A description
of the GFEA propagation equation is presented in [6], and a
detailed derivation is given in [7]. It emerges that few-cycle
pulses receive an extra “phase twist” compared with many-
cycle pulses, and this raises the question of how the funda-
mental characteristics of soliton propagation might be pre-
served in the few-cycle regime.

In simple cases, an SVEA propagation equation can be con-
verted to the corresponding GFEA form, accurate in the few-
cycle limit, merely by applying the following operator to the
polarisation term –

NLS solitons are hyperbolic secant (sech shaped) pulses
that rely on the interplay of third order c (3) (Kerr) nonlinear-
ity and the material dispersion to propagate without chang-
ing.
It is relatively simple to derive the necessary “nonlin-
ear Schroedinger” (NLS) equation for optical pulses in a Kerr
nonlinear medium in the SVEA limit. As usual we write the
ﬁeld in the form E(t, z) = A(t, z)e−ıw 0t + A∗(t, z)eıw 0t , where
the envelope A varies slowly in comparison to the carrier pe-
riod.

The lowest order (bright) soliton solution of the SVEA NLS

equation is a hyperbolic secant pulse, which at z = 0 will be

A(t, 0) = h

sech (h

t) .

(2)

If instead we apply the more general GFEA to the propaga-
tion of optical pulses in a Kerr medium, we ﬁnd that the pulse
envelope of the soliton evolves according to:

locity to phase velocity ratio is s = w 0b 1/b 0, where b n =
dnk(w )/dw n|w 0

Readers will notice that the mathematical form of the ﬁrst
order GFEA correction to eqn.(3) appears similar to the so-
called “optical shock” terms already discussed in the litera-
ture (e.g. see Zaspel[8, 9], or Potasek [2]), which represents
an intensity dependent group velocity. A similar term also
appears in Biswas & Aceves [10] who describe it as the “self-
steepening term for short pulses” (see also [11, 12]), which
originates from a high-order dispersion effect, and is only in-
directly a “short pulse” effect. The origins for these terms are
not the same as for the GFEA correction terms, although they
have the same self-steepening effect.

Note the difference between our GFEA few-cycle terms and
those given by the SEWA of Brabec and Krausz[13], which
is due to their approximation of s = 1. Close inspection of

an alternative propagation equation valid for few-cycle pulses
given by Trippenbach et. al. [14] also reveals a (s − 2) cor-
rection, present in the third nonlinear term on the RHS of their
eqn.(14).

A. GFEA Simulations

The code developed for modelling the propagation of op-
tical pulses in either the SVEA or GFEA regimes is an im-
proved version of the one used in [9]. Normalised units were
based on a carrier frequency of w 0 = 2p
, unit non-
linear coefﬁcient (c = 1), pulse width (h = 1), and peak am-

contain about 10 cycles and 3 cycles respectively. Distances
are normalised by the dispersion distance, so x = z (h /b 2)−1.
Our simulations implement the full GFEA correction to the
polarization, as shown on the LHS of eqn.(1).

n = 20p /D

A typical result for single soliton propagation is shown in
ﬁg. 1. Whereas under the SVEA the pulse would be station-
ary within the display, there is now a drift to larger t values
(reduce group velocity) arising from few-cycle effects. The
results of simulations over a range of values of D
are
shown in ﬁg. 2. The presence of the (2 − s ) term in eqn.(1)
means that, to ﬁrst order, the few-cycle correction vanishes
near s = 2 and the sign of the drift reverses at this point.
Moreover, as the bandwidth represented by D gets larger (and
the number of cycles correspondingly fewer), the velocity
change becomes more pronounced. Note also that, for s = 0,
only two correction terms appear in eqn.(1).

ﬁle (i.e. |A|2) for a D = 3 pulse with group/phase velocity ratio of
s = 1. The pulse starts with an offset of t 0 = −5.

B. Theoretical Group Velocity Shift

It is not necessary to rely on computer simulations to pre-
dict this few-cycle shift in the group velocity, at least in the
case of weak few-cycle effects. Biswas & Aceves [10] have
already provided a multi-scale method giving the effects of
various perturbations on standard NLS soliton propagation.
Their eqn.(13) applied to our NLS equation gives the velocity

Since we assume a small perturbation (eqn.(6)), it is clear
that this prediction is most valid for higher carrier frequen-
cies and/or weaker nonlinearities, i.e. where the effect of the
nonlinearity is small over the time of an optical cycle.

The predictions of eqn.(9) are plotted as solid lines in ﬁg.
2, and the agreement with the numerical simulations is seen
to be remarkably good, even for very wideband pulses (e.g.
the ∼1 cycle cases where D = 8). However, the effect of the
higher order GFEA contributions, present in the simulations
but not in eqn.(9), becomes visible near s = 2, where the ﬁrst
order corrections become small.

III. PARAMETRIC SOLITONS

Parametric solitons, otherwise known as “simultons” or
“quadratic solitons”, rely on the interplay between dispersion

and a second order c (2) interaction to maintain ﬁxed envelope
proﬁles between a pair of pulses propagating in tandem.

A. GFEA Simulations

We use the same basic code as for the Kerr soliton simu-
lations, with the different form of nonlinearity. We use the
normalised units described after eqn.(11).

Fig. 3 shows a typical result for the propagation of a para-
metric soliton. As for the Kerr soliton, few-cycle effects mod-
ify the group velocity. Results for different soliton widths D
and different s values are summarised in ﬁg. 4. The velocity
shift remains remarkably linear even for extremely wideband
pulses. Note that D = 5 corresponds to a 2 cycle pulse, for
which the electric ﬁeld proﬁle would not appear particularly
sech2 shaped, because of the small number of carrier oscilla-
tions. In reality, however, the parabolic form of the material
dispersion assumed in the simulations will not be maintained
over such a wide bandwidth, and other distortions are likely
to predominate over few-cycle effects in these circumstances.
In addition, as the bandwidth increases, the spectra of the two
pulses will eventually overlap, despite the separation of their
carrier frequencies.

(22)

Because the velocity shift for each pulse of the pair mak-
ing up the parametric soliton is the same (at least for ﬁrst or-
der GFEA corrections), the two pulses remain co-propagating,
and the soliton survives.

The predictions of eqn.(22) are plotted as solid lines in ﬁg.
4, and the agreement with the numerical simulations is seen to
be remarkably good, even for wideband pulses (e.g. D ≥ 4).
However, the effect of the higher order GFEA contributions,
present in the simulations but not in eqn.(22), start to become
visible above s ≈ 1.60, since near s = 2 the ﬁrst order few-
cycle correction does not dominate.

We have investigated two types of soliton propagation be-
yond the standard SVEA regime both theoretically and nu-
merically. The most important result is that, according to
the GFEA theory, soliton propagation remains robust in the
few-cycle regime. This is obviously encouraging for proposed
applications involving ultrashort solitons – although for such
wideband pulses, there are other complications beyond just
the few-cycle ones examined in this paper.

The major effect of the shortening pulses is a group veloc-
ity shift, despite the fact that the perturbation term does not
look like a a simple group-velocity term. It is likely that the
few-cycle “phase twist” added to the propagation also affects
the other properties of soliton pulses, e.g. collisions, which
has obvious potential implications for soliton-based ultrafast
optical logic gates.

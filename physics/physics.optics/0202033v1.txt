Driving a double-quantum-well excitonic intersubband resonance
with a terahertz (THz) electric ﬁeld of frequency ωT Hz generated ter-
ahertz optical sidebands ω = ωT Hz + ωNIR on a weak NIR probe.
At high THz intensities, the intersubband dipole energy which cou-
pled two excitons was comparable to the THz photon energy. In this
strong-ﬁeld regime the sideband intensity displayed a non-monotonic
dependence on the THz ﬁeld strength. The oscillating refractive in-
dex which gives rise to the sidebands may be understood by the for-
mation of Floquet states, which oscillate with the same periodicity
as the driving THz ﬁeld.

Electromagnetically-induced coherent quantum effects in
semiconductor systems include Rabi oscillations in donors [1]
and quantum dots [2], and electromagnetically-induced trans-
parency in quantum wells [3]. In these effects, to induce co-
herence the driving ﬁeld must overcome dephasing processes.
Thus, the Rabi frequency µE must be greater than the dephas-
ing rates γ: µE > ¯hγ, where µ is the dipole moment and E
is the electric ﬁeld strength.

If the ﬁeld strength is increased still further, a strong-ﬁeld
regime is encountered as the Rabi energy becomes compara-
ble to the photon energy: µE ≥ ¯hω. Previous studies into this
regime have looked at atoms in microwave cavities [4,5] and
strong laser ﬁelds [6]. Since atomic excited states are near the
continuum, strong-ﬁeld effects manifest themselves as non-
monotonic multi-photon ionization rates as a function of ﬁeld
strength.

However, the atoms are ionized, meaning the bound states
do not exist after the microwave or laser ﬁeld is turned on.
Multi-photon ionization is an inescapable result of driving ex-
cited atomic levels which get closer and closer together.

There is a rich body of theoretical predictions on the effect
of strong ﬁelds on the bound states of a quantum system [7,8].
In quantum wells, upper states get further and further apart.
Thus the strong-ﬁeld condition can be satisﬁed by resonantly
driving the lowest subbands of a quantum well at THz fre-
quencies. Yet the quantum well is far deeper than the Rabi
energy, so the bound states still survive.

We describe experiments in which a near-infrared (NIR)
probe laser beam is mixed with a terahertz (THz) pump beam
in a gated, asymmetric double quantum well (DQW). The
THz ﬁeld couples to an excitonic intersubband excitation
while the NIR ﬁeld couples to an excitonic interband exci-

1

tation. Applying a DC voltage to the gates brings the inter-
subband transition into resonance with the THz ﬁeld, and the
interband transition into resonance with the NIR ﬁeld. When
these resonance conditions are met the NIR probe is mod-
ulated resulting in the emission of optical sidebands which
appear at frequencies ωsideband = ωN IR + nωT Hz where
ωN IR (ωT Hz) is the frequency of the NIR (THz) beam and
n = ±1, 2, . . .. Strong-ﬁeld effects manifest themselves as
non-monotonic sideband intensities as a function of THz ﬁeld
strength.

The sample consisted of an active region, gates, and a dis-
tributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR). The active region consisted 5
periods of DQW, each consisting of a 120 ˚A GaAs QW and
a 100 ˚A GaAs QW separated by a 25 ˚A Al0.2Ga0.8As tunnel
barrier. Each period was separated by a 300 ˚A Al0.3Ga0.7As
barrier. The active region was sandwiched between two gates,
each consisting of a Si delta-doped 70 ˚A QW with carrier den-
sity ≈ 1 × 1012 cm−2. The gates were separated from the
active region by 3000 ˚A Al0.3Ga0.7As barriers. Since the gate
QWs are much narrower than the active DQWs, the gate QWs
are transparent to both the THz and NIR beams. The gated
DQWs were grown on top of a DBR which consisted of 15
periods of 689 ˚A AlAs and 606 ˚A Al0.3Ga0.7As. It had a low-
temperature passband nearly centered on the low-temperature
bandgap of the DQW, making it about 95% reﬂective for the
NIR probe beam and sidebands.

We etched a mesa and annealed NiGeAu ohmic contacts to
the gate QWs. The sample was then cleaved into a 1 mm wide
strip, 8 mm long. We then cleaved a 400 µm-thick wafer of
crystal sapphire substrate material into a 1 × 5 mm strip, ori-
ented with the optically slow axis along the long dimension.
The sapphire was mechanically pressed against the surface of
the sample with a beryllium copper clip as shown in Fig. 1.
At cryogenic temperatures sapphire is index-matched to GaAs
and transparent at THz wavelengths. At the same time, sap-
phire is transparent to the NIR probe. Pressing the sapphire
against the sample forms a rectangular dielectric waveguide
with half of the waveguide deﬁned by the sample substrate and
the other half deﬁned by the sapphire. The epilayer containing
the active region lies in the middle of the heavily over-moded
waveguide. This results in much higher ﬁelds at the active re-
gion than would be possible without the sapphire, where the
active region would be at the edge of a dielectric waveguide.
The sample was cooled to 21 K in a closed-cycle He cryo-
stat. The 1 kW THz beam from a free-electron laser is polar-
ized in the growth direction, propagated in the QW plane and

focused by a 90o off-axis parabolic mirror (F/1) into the edge
of the waveguide. The maximum THz electric ﬁeld strength at
the focus is estimated to be between ≈ 5 − 20 kV/cm, where
our uncertainty comes from uncertainty of the exact size of the
mode in the waveguide. The THz power can be continuously
varied by a pair of wire-grid polarizers.

NIR light from a continuous-wave Ti:sapphire laser is
chopped by an acousto-optic modulator into 25 µs pulses
which overlap the 5 µs FEL pulses at maximum repetition
rate of 1.5 Hz. The vertically-polarized NIR beam propagates
normal to the THz beam, and was focused (F/10) at a power
density of ≈ 5 W/cm2 to the same small interaction volume
in the sample. The reﬂected beam, sidebands, and photolumi-
nescence (PL) are analyzed by a second polarizer, dispersed
by a 0.85 m double-monochromator, and detected by a photo-
multiplier tube.

Previous work [9,10] showed that sideband generation is
enhanced when the NIR ﬁeld resonantly couples the vacuum
state |0i with an exciton |1i, and the THz ﬁeld resonantly cou-
ples with the intersubband transition between excitons |1i and
|2i. The exciton states can be labelled as EµHHνX, indicat-
ing an exciton consisting of an electron in conduction sub-
band µ and a heavy hole in valence subband ν. Changing the
DC electric ﬁeld tunes the excitonic intersubband transition
into resonance with the THz ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 2. The
sideband resonance we focused on is E2HH2X-E2HH3X, a
peak assignment made by comparing low-ﬁeld sideband spec-
troscopy with a nonlinear susceptibility calculation for exci-
tons [10].

Fig. 3 shows the dependence on THz ﬁeld strength of side-
band generation at various THz frequencies. Each curve was
taken at a gate bias near the E2HH2X-E2HH3X resonance
[10]. The most striking feature is the non-monotonic behavior
in the strong-ﬁeld regime when the Rabi energy is comparable
to the photon energy. Clearly at lower frequencies the power
dependence rolls over at a lower ﬁeld strength.

By sitting at

the peak NIR frequency for E2HH2X-
E2HH3X and varying the DC gate voltage we took THz power
dependence scans at various THz detunings E2 −E1 −¯hωT Hz
where E2 (E1) is the energy of the upper (lower) exciton state.
The results are shown in Fig. 4. As the detuning is varied, so
does the shape of the THz ﬁeld dependence.

The power dependence cannot be explained by a nonlinear
susceptibility, which is inherently a low-ﬁeld theory because
it relies on a Taylor expansion about the ﬁeld strength [11].
Saturation effects [12] in a nonlinear susceptibility can only
come about when contributions from virtual transitions ini-
tiated from excited states |1i or |2i are comparable to those
initiated from the vacuum |0i. However the populations of ex-
cited states |1i or |2i are never signiﬁcant compared with |0i
in our undoped sample and weak NIR beam. Therefore a non-
linear susceptibility can only predict a linear (quadratic) de-
pendence of sideband intensity on THz power (ﬁeld strength).
three-state
model captures qualitative features of the dependence of side-
bands on THz power. The Hamiltonian H0 has eigenstates

The following simple, phenomenological,

φ0(x, z), φ1(x, z), and φ2(x, z) with eigenenergies E0 = 0,
E1, and E2, respectively. Near the experimental resonance,
the effect of the DC voltage is to tune φ2 while the other φ1
remains relatively unchanged [10]. The two exciton states
φ1(x, z) and φ2(x, z) are coupled by the z-dipole operator
for the DC and THz ﬁelds. The two upper states φ1(x, z) and
φ2(x, z) are coupled to the ground state by the x-dipole oper-
ator for the NIR ﬁeld.

Therefore, the x and z matrices are

the nonzero terms xαβ = hφα|x|φβ i and zαβ =

All
hφα|z|φβi are set equal to unity. The Hamiltonian is

H = H0 + zEω cos ωt + xλEΩ cos Ωt

where Eω represents the strong THz electric ﬁeld strength
and EΩ represents the weak NIR electric ﬁeld. We solved
the Hamiltonian nonperturbatively within a Floquet formal-
ism for λ = 0, while the weak probe was added later using
time-dependent perturbation theory.

The solutions to the Schrodinger equation for the time-

periodic Hamiltonian have the form [13]

ϕi(z, t) = e−iǫit/¯hui(z, t), u(z, t) = u(z, t +

2π
ω

)

where ui(z, t) has the same periodicity as the driving fre-
quency and and ǫi is called the quasienergy. The states
ϕi(z, t) are called Floquet states and are mathematically anal-
ogous to Bloch states for a spatially-periodic Hamiltonian.
Meanwhile the quasienergies are analogous to the crystal mo-
menta of Bloch theory.

The spatial-dependence of the wavefunction ϕi(z, t) can be
expanded in terms of the original eigenstates φα(z), and the
time-dependence can be Fourier-expanded

The coefﬁcients ci
α,n are what will determine the part of the
index of refraction which will oscillate at particular multi-
ples of ω. Solving for these coefﬁcients is the key to un-
derstanding the power dependence of the sideband. These
Floquet coefﬁcients are closely related to the photon-assisted
tunnelling sidebands which appear in the irradiated current-
voltage curves in superconducting weak-link junctions [14]
and coupled quantum wells [15].

The time-dependent Schrodinger equation can be cast in

where [H0] and [µ] are matrix representations of the opera-
tors H0 and µ in the |φαi basis. In practice the Floquet matrix
must be truncated up to ±N photons. N can be made arbitrar-
ily large for an arbitrarily precise result at high ﬁeld strengths.
The solution to the Schrodinger equation for a time-periodic
Hamiltonian reduces to ﬁnding the eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors of the Floquet matrix (2). Other than the ±N truncation
the solution involves no perturbation or rotating-wave approx-
imations. Here we used N = 16 photons.

The Floquet solutions are labeled ϕi(x, z, t) with i =
0, 1, 2, and expanded as in (1). Their expansions are explicitly
expressed for clarity:

ϕ0(x, z, t) = φ0(x, z)
ϕ1(x, z, t) = eiǫ1t/¯h

The ground state φ0(x, z) is not coupled by the the strong
ﬁeld to the 2-d subspace spanned by |φ1i and |φ2i. Therefore
the coefﬁcients for the Floquet state ϕ0(x, z, t) vanish except
c0
0,0 = 1. In other words, the ground vacuum state remains
untouched by the intense THz ﬁeld.

The dipole response of the Floquet states to the weak NIR
probe is calculated perturbatively. The state of the system with
both driving ﬁelds ψ(x, z, t) can be expanded in terms of the
Floquet states ϕi(x, z, t) to ﬁrst order. Discarding second or-
der terms and anti-resonant contributions, the dipole expecta-
tion is given by

The form of (3) is the same as the linear susceptibility of an
undriven system, except the states ϕi are oscillating Floquet
states instead of stationary states. Explicitly expanding the
Floquet states in the numerator gives us an expression for the
polarization

The +1ω sideband is given by the Fourier component of
x(t) oscillating at the frequency Ω+1ω. Also, for the resonant
condition illustrated in Fig. 2, ¯hω ≈ ǫ1, so we keep only the
i = 1 term in the sum (4). This condition is satisﬁed when
n − m = 1. Thus we obtain an expression for the sideband
polarization

The intensity of the sideband is proportional to x2

This is plotted vs. ﬁeld strength for various detunings in Fig.

5. The detuning parameter d is the level spacing normalized
by the photon energy of the strong ﬁeld, d = E2−E1
¯hω .

Our model captures the rollover of the resonant power de-
pendence up to ﬁeld strengths of around µE
¯hω ≈ 1.5. Given a
calculated excitonic intersubband dipole of µ
e = 12 nm [10],
the strong-ﬁeld condition is met at a THz ﬁeld of 5 kV/cm.
However, experimentally the sideband never completely dis-
appears, a striking prediction of the theory. It is unlikely that a
3-state simpliﬁcation is entirely valid because there is a spec-
trum of other exciton states as well as an electron-hole contin-
uum that may provide signiﬁcant off-resonant contributions.

To summarize, we drove an quantum-well excitonic inter-
subband transition with an intense THz laser ﬁeld in a regime
where the Rabi energy was comparable to the photon energy.
The nonlinear mixing between the THz pump and a weak NIR
probe displayed a nonmonotonic dependence on THz power,
which could not be explained by a conventional nonlinear sus-
ceptibility. Rather, the excitons were dressed by the THz ﬁeld,
a process which we described in a simple three-level model in
which the interaction between excitons and the THz ﬁeld is
solved non-perturbatively within the Floquet formalism.

Abstract:
Time-resolved optical ﬁltering (TROF) measures the spec-
trogram or sonogram by a fast photodiode followed a tunable narrowband
optical ﬁlter. For periodic signal and to match the sonogram, numerical
TROF algorithm is used to ﬁnd the original complex electric ﬁeld or
equivalently both the amplitude and phase. For phase-modulated optical
signals, the TROF algorithm is initiated using the craters and ridges of the
sonogram.

Introduction

Recently, differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) signal has received renewed interests for long-
haul lightwave transmissions [1–8]. Compared with conventional on-off keying, DPSK sig-
nal provides 3-dB improvement in receiver sensitivity. With its low peak power and constant-

intensity, DPSK signal can also provide better tolerance to ﬁber nonlinearities than on-off key-
ing [6–9]. However, unlike on-off keying signal, the signal phase or the complex signal cannot
directly be measured using a photodiode. Method to measure the phase and amplitude of an
optical signal is important for the further development of DPSK signals.

Conventionally, the complex electric ﬁeld is measured by a quadrature receiver with a 90◦
optical hybrid [8,10,11]. Recently, optical phase was measured based on similar technique with
a pulse source as local oscillator [12]. Those measurements are similar to a receiver that can
ﬁnd both in- and quadrature-phase components of an electric ﬁeld [13, 14]. Requiring a local
oscillator with about the same wavelength as the signal, those measurements may be difﬁcult
to conduct and not available in most communication laboratories.

A complex signal including the amplitude and phase is measured here using time-resolved
optical ﬁltering (TROF). The method is the time-frequency duality of frequency-resolved op-
tical grating (FROG) [15–17]. FROG measures the spectrogram of an optically sampled pulse
of

IFROG(w

, t ) =

E(t)G(t − t )e− jw

t dt

where E(t) is the complex electric ﬁeld, G(t) is the waveform of the grating pulse, and t
is the time-delay of the gating pulse. Numerically, the FROG trace is the calculation of the
spectrogram using short-time Fourier transform [18, 19].

TROF measures the sonogram of an optically ﬁltered signal of

ITROF(t, n ) =

E(w )H(w − n )e jw

tdw

where E(w ) is the spectrum of the optical signal, H(w ) is the frequency response of the tunable
optical ﬁlter, and n
is the center frequency of H(w ). In FROG, the spectrogram is used to
retrieve the phase of E(t). In TROF, the sonogram is used to retrieve the phase of E(w ) and
equivalently, via inverse Fourier transform, the phase of E(t).

When the sonogram of (2) is compared with the spectrogram of (1), the exchange of fre-
quency and time transforms the methods between FROG and TROF. As a dual of FROG,
the theory for FROG is applicable to TROF. However, FROG is typically for short optical
pulses [15–17, 20–22]. Theory for FROG for uniqueness generally assumes a signal with ﬁ-
nite support, i.e., time-limited short pulse [16, 23]. Here, we are interested of using TROF for
continuous-time inﬁnite-support periodic DPSK signals. For the convenience to use fast Fourier
transform, we assume a periodic optical signal in this paper. Typical measurements can use the
whole 27 − 1 pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) as a periodic signal.

With the same application as FROG, sonogram was used to measure the complex electric
ﬁeld of an short optical pulse [24–26]. Unlike previous measurement based on nonlinear process
like two-photon absorption [26] or optical sampling [25], electrical sampling is sufﬁcient for
typical 10- and 40-Gb/s signals. Although the trace of (2) is called sonogram for optical pulses,
it is just another method to ﬁnd the spectrogram of (1) [27]. The TROF trace of (2) is by itself
also a spectrogram.

The sonogram or spectrogram is commonly used in time-resolved chirp measurement of an
optical signal and directly measured using a sampling scope followed a tunable optical ﬁlter
[28, 29]. However, time-resolved chirp measurement can use a ﬁlter bandwidth far larger than
that for TROF. To certain extend, a sonogram is another representation of the original data
for time-resolved chirp measurement but for the calculation of the complex electric ﬁeld. This
paper does not invent new measurement equipment but provides a new interpretation of existing
measured data to obtain new results.

The remaining parts of this paper are the following: Sec. 2 shows the TROF traces of some
DPSK signals. The shape of the TROF traces can be used to initiate the algorithm to ﬁnd
the signal from TROF traces. Sec. 3 ﬁrst discusses the equipment and method to measure the
TROF traces and then the inverse problem to ﬁnd the signal from the measured TROF trace. A
numerical optimization method is used. Secs. 4 and 5 are the discussion and conclusion of the
paper, respectively.

where ck are the Fourier coefﬁcients of E(t), H(w ) is the frequency response of the tunable
narrowband optical ﬁlter, and n are the centered frequencies in the measurement of the TROF
trace.

The goal of this paper is the “inverse” problem to ﬁnd the signal of E(t) using the TROF
trace of (4). For illustration purpose and to understand the problem, the “direct” problem is
simulated. The “direct” problem ﬁnds the TROF trace of a known signal, in here, a phase-
modulated optical signal.

Figure 1 shows the simulated TROF traces for non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and return-to-zero
(RZ) DPSK signals. In Fig. 1, the optical ﬁlter of H(w ) has a Gaussian response and a full-
width-half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of half the data rate of 0.5/Tb, where Tb is the bit
period of the data stream. Figure 1 uses a 7-bit data pattern of +1, −1, −1, +1, −1, +1, +1 as
an example for illustration purpose. The center frequencies of the tunable ﬁlter [n
in (4)] tune
between ±2/Tb, i.e., twice the data rate. The important properties of a TROF trace are all shown
in Fig. 1 for periodic phase-modulated signals.

Figure 1(a) is the TROF trace for NRZ-DPSK signal that is generated by a Mach-Zehnder
amplitude modulator when the modulator is biased at the minimum transmission point and
driven by a driving voltage swing of 2Vp
[6, 7]. From Fig. 1(a), there is an opening in the
TROF trace, called a “crater”, centered at a phase jump. Consecutive phase jumps cascade to
a large crater. Without a phase jump, the TROF trace is concentrated around zero frequency,
giving a “ridge”. The craters and ridges of a TROF trace can be used to detect a DPSK signal,
similar to the function of an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer [1, 6, 7] or a frequency
discriminator [30]. Of course, the purpose here is to calculate both the phase and amplitude of a
complex electric ﬁeld. The craters and ridges can be used to ﬁnd the initial guess for the TROF
algorithm explained in later parts of this paper.

Figure 1(b) shows the TROF trace of an NRZ-DPSK signal with ﬁber chromatic dispersion.
The amount of chromatic dispersion is equivalent to a 10-Gb/s signal propagated through 60-
km of standard single-mode ﬁber with dispersion coefﬁcient of D = 17 ps/km/nm. The lower
curves of Fig. 1(b) include the non-zero imaginary part of the electric ﬁeld. The real part of
Fig. 1(b) is not as smooth as that for Fig. 1(a). Similar to Fig. 1(a), even with ﬁber dispersion,
the TROF trace of Fig. 1(b) has both craters and ridges. Those craters and ridges can use to
initiate the TROF algorithm. Due to ﬁber dispersion, each crater and ridge in the TROF trace

is rotated. Later parts of this paper measure the TROF traces of NRZ-DPSK signals with and
without chromatic dispersion and ﬁnd the corresponding electric ﬁeld of E(t).

Not able to generate in our measurement, RZ-DPSK signal is the dominant signal format
[1–7]. Figures 1(c) and (d) show the TROF traces of RZ-DPSK signal. The RZ-DPSK signal
uses the standard RZ pulses having a duty cycle of 1/2 [6, 7]. The major craters and ridges of
the TROF trace of Fig. 1(c) are similar to that of Fig. 1(a). The subtle difference is both thicker
and higher crater “rim” for RZ- than NRZ-DPSK signals. Figure 1(c) also shows some satellite
craters among both sides of a ridge, mostly due to the frequency sideband of RZ-DPSK signals.
Both the TROF trace of Figs. 1(a) and (c) are symmetric with respect to the signal frequency,
showing a signal without frequency chirp.

RZ-DPSK signal with chromatic dispersion has a TROF trace largely the same as that of
Fig. 1(a). Figure 1(d) shows the TROF trace of an RZ-DPSK signal with self-phase modulation
(SPM). The mean nonlinear phase shift is 1 rad. Unlike the case with chromatic dispersion of
Fig. 1(b), the signal spectrum is broadened for signal with SPM. The craters among both sides
of a ridge are larger and deeper than Fig. 1(c). Both the craters and ridges are also slightly
rotated.

The FWHM bandwidth of the ﬁlter is 50% the data rate for the TROF traces of Fig. 1.
Qualitatively, if the ﬁlter bandwidth is too wide, the short craters between consecutive phase
jumps may not able to cascade to a long crater. If the ﬁlter bandwidth is too narrow, the short
ridge may degenerate to a shallow crater. Currently, there is no study on the optimal bandwidth

to measure the TROF trace. Practical measurement may use a bandwidth about 40 to 60% the
peak-to-notch bandwidth of the signal.

3. TROF Measurement and TROF Algorithm

The measurement of TROF traces is an experimental implementation for the expressions of (2)
or (4). Figure 2 is the schematic diagram of the setup to measure TROF trace. Operated at the
wavelength of 1533 nm, a 10-Gb/s NRZ-DPSK signal is generated by the method described
for Fig. 1(a). For a practical communication signal, the signal is a 27 − 1 PRBS with a period
of T = 12.7 ns. The PRBS includes all permutations of 7-bit length pattern except the all zero
pattern. The NRZ-DPSK signal is passed to the TROF measurement equipment with or without
passing through optical ﬁber. The ﬁber has a dispersion coefﬁcient of D = 17 ps/km/nm. An
Erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA) is used to compensate for the loss at the tunable optical
ﬁlter.

Fig. 2. Experimental setup to measure TROF trace

TROF equipment consists of a tunable optical ﬁlter, corresponding to the different response
of H(w − n l) with center frequencies of n l, and a high-speed optical-to-electric converter. Sim-
ilar to [29], Figure 2 uses the monochromator in Agilent 86146B with a FWHM bandwidth of
0.04 nm as the tunable optical ﬁlter. Operated around the wavelength of 1533 nm, the FWHM
bandwidth is about 5 GHz. The optical-to-electrical converter is the sampling module of Agilent
86116A together with the 86100B digital communication analyzer mainframe. The sampling
module has a bandwidth of 53 GHz for optical signal, more than sufﬁcient for 10-Gb/s signal.
From the physical properties of the monochromator [31], the frequency response of H(w ) is
linear phase without chirp. The transfer function of H(w ) is also shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3
shows the measured TROF traces for a NRZ-DPSK signal after the propagation of 0, 20, 40,
and 60 km of standard single-mode optical ﬁber.

The TROF traces of Fig. 3 have N = 2048 evenly sample points. With 64 centered frequency
of n l scanned within ±0.14 nm of the signal wavelength, each TROF trace is a 64 × 2048 array
of data. In the wavelength of 1533 nm, ±0.14 nm corresponds to ±17.5 GHz. Unlike FROG or
similar technique with a square data array and a fast algorithm [17, 26], only the conventional
method of [15] is applicable for the rectangular array for TROF.

Due to propagation delay, the TROF traces are acquired with different delay. The arrow
of each TROF trace indicates the beginning of data acquisition. With an acquisition window
the same as the data period, the TROF traces of Fig. 3 are aligned by post-processing and
normalized with peak unity intensity.

Other than a longer pattern with 27 − 1 bits, the TROF traces of Fig. 3 are very similar to Figs.
1(a) and (b) without and with chromatic dispersion, respectively. Without chromatic dispersion,
similar craters and ridges appear in Fig. 3 symmetrical with respect to the signal wavelength.
With the increases of chromatic dispersion, the TROF trace becomes more asymmetric with

Fig. 3. Measured TROF traces for NRZ-DPSK signal after 0-, 20-, 40-, and 60-km of
single-mode ﬁber. The arrows are the beginning of data acquisition.

respect to the center wavelength and clockwise rotated. The rotation angle increases with the
amount of chromatic dispersion. The TROF trace of Fig. 1(b) is the vertical ﬂip of those in Fig.
3 as the y-axis is frequency in Fig. 1(b) and the y-axis is wavelength in Fig. 3. Because the
increase of wavelength decreases the frequency, the TROF trace with wavelength shift as y-axis
is the vertical ﬂip of the TROF trace with frequency shift as y-axis.

From the Appendix, the periodic electric ﬁeld of E(t) is uniquely determined by its TROF
trace up to a constant factor. However, the method from the Appendix cannot convert to a
practical numerical method because noise in the TROF trace leads to divergent electric ﬁeld of
E(t).

With a measured TROF trace of Imeas(tm, n l) at each time sample of tm of Fig. 3, similar to
the method of [15], numerical optimization is used to ﬁnd the complex electric ﬁeld of E(t)
from (3). The TROF algorithm minimizes the mean-square error (MSE) of

There are many numerical optimization methods to ﬁnd the values of Em = E(tm) to minimize
the MSE of (5) [32]. Conjugate gradient method is especially suitable for this optimization
problem.The gradient of the MSE, (cid:209) E , composites by the differentiation of

Fig. 4. The normalized complex electric ﬁeld calculated numerically from the TROF traces
of Fig. 3. (a) Real part, (b) imaginary part.

Figure 4 shows the complex-value electric ﬁeld calculated by the TROF algorithm initiated
by the craters and ridges of the sonogram. Even with various amount of chromatic dispersion,
the TROF algorithm is initiated by the same waveform. The TROF algorithm converges within
less than 20 iterations to a MSE about 0.5%, 1.3%, 0.9%, and 1.1% for 0-, 20-, 40-, and 60-km
of single-mode ﬁber, respectively. The real part of the waveform of Fig. 4(a) has distortion in-
creased with chromatic dispersion. The imaginary part of the waveform of Fig. 4(b) is originally
very close to zero without ﬁber dispersion but becomes larger with the increase of chromatic
dispersion.

In general and without special precaution, the MSE increases with the ﬁber distance mainly
due to timing error. Over the measurement interval, the ﬁber may be expanded or contracted
with environment temperature. The small difference of propagation distance induces timing
error between the value of Imeas(t, n l) in early and later parts of the measurement. The TROF
trace measurement of Fig. 3 already shortens the measurement time to minimize this effect.
With chromatic dispersion, there is also bigger difference between the initial guess and the
optimized electric ﬁeld than the case without chromatic dispersion. With longer distance, the
ampliﬁer noise for 60-km measurement is also larger than that without optical ﬁber.

4. Discussion

From the theory of [33], the accuracy of sonogram is limited by the time-resolved power of the
electrical sampling head. A resolution down to femtosecond is required to characterize optical
short pulses [24–26].

Requiring a resolution of few picoseconds, the TROF traces of Fig. 3 are measured by an
electrical sampling head with 53 GHz of bandwidth. Equivalently, other than noise, the meas-
ured TROF traces are Imeas(t, n l) = ITROF(t, n ) ⊗ hs(t), where ⊗ denotes convolution and hs(t)
is the impulse response of the optical sampling head. To include the contribution of hs(t) to the
theory of the Appendix, im(n ) deﬁned by (13) becomes im(n )Hs (2p m/T ), where Hs(w ) is the
frequency response of the optical sampling head. For 10-Gb/s signal, only the parts of Hs(w )
with frequencies less than 20 GHz are important. With a 53-GHz sampling head, hs(t) is a very
short impulse response and Hs(w ) has a very wide bandwidth. Without chromatic dispersion,
the ripples of Fig. 4 may be from the electrical sampling head. Measured using the same sam-
pling head, the intensity of an optical signal has similar ripples. In the measurement of optical
signal for communication purpose, the ripples from the sampling head are usually tolerated as
measurement artifacts.

In this paper, periodic signal is considered for the convenience of using fast Fourier trans-
form. The number of data samples is a power of 2 for fast Fourier transform. With proper
windowing, the algorithm can be generalized to non-periodic signal.

In previous section, the TROF algorithm is developed assuming that Em is a real signal.
For practical complex signal of Em, the number of unknown variables is doubled. Only minor
modiﬁcations are required for both (6) and (7) for complex signal.

The craters and ridges of the spectrogram are special for phase-modulated signals. For other
signal types without a proper initial guess, the TROF algorithm requires time-consuming cal-
culation. The TROF algorithm may have “stagnation” problem similar to FROG algorithm
[16, 17, 23].

5. Conclusion

The time-frequency dual of FROG, TROF is used for periodic phase-modulated optical signals.
TROF uses only electrical sampling followed an optical-to-electrical converter. To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst application of similar techniques to signal with inﬁnite support instead of
short pulse with ﬁnite support.

The uniqueness of the signal from a TROF trace is proved analytically for periodic signal.
Based on standard setup for time-resolved chirp measurement, the TROF traces are measured
for phase-modulated signals with and without chromatic dispersion. The signal is determined
from the measured TROF trace based on numerical optimization to minimize the difference
between the analytical and measured TROF traces. The TROF algorithm converges within 20
iterations to a MSE around or less than 1%.

The above analysis is similar to that in [18,33] for signal with ﬁnite support. The sonogram is
basically the time-frequency distribution of a periodic signal with a kernel of hm(t ). Although
similar theory is not discussed in both [18, 33], the principle remains the same.

The above analysis conﬁrms the existence and the uniqueness of the signal of E(t) from the
sonogram of ITROF(t, n ) up to a constant factor of c0 or c1. However, the kernel of hm(t ) is very
small for large t . For example, if H(w ) = exp(−w 2/2w 2

0 ) as a Gaussian ﬁlter, the kernel of

becomes very small for t ≫ 1/w 0. In theory,
is either comparable or smaller
than hm(t ). In practical calculation, a small hm(t ) is numerically difﬁcult to handle. If the
R
measurement of the TROF trace of ITROF(t, n ) has noise or the calculation of im(n ) has small
numerical error, the electric ﬁeld of E(t) has enormous error. Nevertheless, the technique is
applicable for short pulse with ﬁnite support [25].

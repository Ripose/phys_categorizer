Cascaded generation of multiply charged optical vortices and spatiotemporal helical
beams in a Raman medium

We propose a technique for spatiotemporal control and shaping of electromagnetic waves in a
coherently excited Raman medium. Our approach relies on the cascaded excitation of multiply
charged optical vortices and can lead to generation of strongly spatially and temporally compressed
pulses on a defocusing side of the Raman resonance and to the helically shaped optical solitons on
the focusing side.

The development of methods for controlled shaping of
electromagnetic waves in space and time is one of the
most important driving forces behind many of the ad-
vances in modern optics. Two prominent examples of
such control, which are directly relevant to the present
work, are the techniques developed for the generation of
ultrashort pulses [1, 2] and of optical beams with he-
lical phase-fronts, commonly known as optical vortices
[3, 4]. The applications of ultrashort pulses include time
resolved measurements of molecular and electron motion,
spectroscopy, control of chemical reactions, generation of
extreme wavelengths and biomedical diagnostics [1]. Op-
tical vortices carry orbital angular momentum (OAM)
and their proposed applications include optical tweezers
for mechanical manipulation by micro- and nano-objects
[5], quantum information [6], and imaging [7]. Nonlin-
ear optical methods have been used in various ways to
achieve pulse compression [1, 2, 8] and also to manipulate
the OAM of light, see, e.g., [3, 4, 9, 10]. The interplay be-
tween spatial and temporal dynamics in nonlinear media
has also become an active research topic, which is rich in
new fundamental physics and relevant for many applica-
tions, see, e.g., [8, 11]. In this work we suggest a method
for manipulation by the frequency and angular harmon-
ics of light opening new opportunities for simultaneous
spatial and temporal shaping of optical waves. Amongst
others, we demonstrate the eﬀect of cascaded vortex gen-
eration, describe the counter-intuitive process of strong
spatial compression induced by self-defocusing nonlinear-
ity and generation of spatio-temporal helical beams in the
soliton and non-soliton regimes.

The system considered below is a Raman active gas,
where excitation of multiple harmonics can be used for
strong pulse compression [2, 12, 13]. In particular, it has
been demonstrated that the two frequency excitation of a
Raman transition away from the resonance can generate
frequency combs and induce nonlinearity related chirp
[2, 13]. The nonlinear chirp can be compensated for by
the intrinsic group velocity dispersion (GVD) of the ma-
terial resulting in the generation of trains of ultra-short
(close to single-cycle) pulses [2, 13]. Note, that the gen-
eration of the frequency combs with this technique relies
not on the Raman gain, but on a four-wave mixing pro-
cess which dominates the wings of the Raman line and

induces strong eﬀective Kerr nonlinearity [14]. Regard-
ing the angular momentum, the experiments with sec-
ond harmonic generation by optical vortices have demon-
strated that two photons with frequency ω and an OAM
quantum number (or vortex charge) l produce a single
photon with frequency 2ω and OAM 2l [9]. Analogous
OAM conversion rules have been reported for soliton-
like beams within the second harmonic generation model
[4, 15], for degenerate four-wave mixing within Kerr-like
materials [16], and for three-wave Raman resonant pro-
cess with higher order Bessel-beams [10].

The starting idea for the results presented below is that
the cascaded oﬀ-resonant Raman process, as in [2], is ini-
tiated under conditions where one of the two frequency
detuned driving ﬁelds is a singly charged vortex beam.
In this case, the phase dependent nonlinear coupling be-
tween the Raman side-bands (the same coupling, as that
which drives frequency conversion) causes cascaded gen-
eration of multiply charged vortices. A dimensionless
model describing the evolution of the side-bands is [2, 17]

rule is analogous to the one for the frequencies and l1 −
can be considered as the seeded modulation of OAM. In
a particular example considered below l0 = 0 and l1 = 1,
so that ln = n.
For suﬃciently strong input ﬁelds
Raman four-wave mixing should develop in a cascaded
manner and excite higher-order Stokes and anti-Stokes
ﬁelds carrying progressively larger OAM quantum num-
bers. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1, where we show
the transverse proﬁles of the phases of the side-bands
found by numerical integration of Eqs. (1), (2) with 47

sidebands and the initial conditions E0 = A0e−r
0 ,
E1 = A1reiθ−r
1 , En6=0,1 = 0 (r2 = x2 + y2). One can
see that the generated Stokes (n < 0) and anti-Stokes
(n > 0) components carry progressively increasing vor-
tex charges, which can be inferred from the number of
jumps between the blue (zero phase) and red (phase 2π)
colors (see areas around the beam centers in Fig. 1). The
eﬃciency of the OAM conversion (in terms of the phase

matching requirements) is the same as the eﬃciency of
the frequency conversion. However, when dealing with
spatially inhomogeneous beams one should provide suf-
ﬁcient initial overlap of the two pump ﬁelds to build a
strong coherence q. This is achieved by using a vortex
free Gaussian beam wider than the one with a vortex
(w0 > w1).

The above result suggest that the methods of frequency
domain wave synthesis [2, 12, 13] have the potential to be
extended to the angular momentum components, and so
can be used for simultaneous spatial and temporal beam
shaping. This is because, the frequency harmonics in our
scheme are, at the same time, the angular harmonics. To
start analyzing problem of spatio-temporal beam shaping
it is instructive to get some analytical information about
the phase evolution under the condition of two ﬁeld exci-
tation. First, we assume that En = fn(r, z)einθ and that
the ﬁelds apart from n = 0, 1 are initially zero. Then by
neglecting the dispersion (βn = 0) and the r-derivatives
of fn (i.e., the radial diﬀraction), we can ﬁnd an explicit
analytical solution to Eqs. (1), (2). This solution gives
us z-dependence for all fn’s in terms of Bessel functions
[2]. Using known identities for the Bessel functions one
can ﬁnd the expression for the total ﬁeld

where q0 = q(z = 0). In our case, the known result for
Etot [2] is altered by the presence of θ inside both the
phase chirp and amplitude modulation. From the am-
plitude modulation term one can see that the emerging
intensity pattern of
corresponds to a helix. The
helical shape of the isointensity surfaces can be seen in
both the (x, y, t) and (x, y, z) subspaces. The time pe-
riod of the ﬁrst is 2π and the spatial period of the second
is 2π/K. Changing l1 to
1 changes the sign in front
−
of θ. One can also note, that the directions of rotation
(chirality) of the helices in t and z are opposite.

The phase chirp in (3) is induced by the Raman co-
herence and plays a crucial role in the evolution of the
ﬁeld, when dispersion and diﬀraction are taken into ac-
count. In typical cases the background dispersion of the
gas is normal, meaning that the compensation of the Ra-
man chirp occurs for negative detunings from the Raman
1). Since diﬀraction in general and, in
resonance (j =
−
∂2
particular, angular diﬀraction (
θ ) is mathematically
equivalent to anomalous GVD, it seems at the ﬁrst glance
that the simultaneous temporal and azimuthal compres-
sions for materials with normal GVD are not possible,
because the coherence induced azimuthal and temporal
chirps have the same sign j. The reality, conﬁrmed by nu-
merical modeling, is, however, more intriguing. Indeed,
the angular and frequency harmonics in our case have the
same complex amplitudes fn. This implies that strong
coupling between spatial and temporal degrees of free-

dom occurs in our system. Therefore we can assert that
if the characteristic length Lcom, over which maximal
pulse compression is achieved, is shorter than the char-
acteristic diﬀraction length Ld, then the temporal and
azimuthal compression should develop together. Model-

To observe the eﬀect of simultaneous temporal and az-
imuthal compression with j =
1 (defocusing nonlin-
earity) and normal GVD (p2 > 0) we take the initial
excitation like in the modeling shown in Fig. 1, but use
wider beams (w0 = 10√20, w1 = 10√10), in order to
minimize the role of diﬀraction over the propagation dis-
tances
Lcom. The results of this modeling are shown
in Figs. 2,3. One can see that for a propagation dis-
tance of z = 20 there are around 30 harmonics gen-
erated, see Fig. 3(a), implying the presence of vortex
beams with
= 15. Simultaneously, a high degree of
the temporal and azimuthal compression is achieved, cf.
Fig. 2 (z=20) and Fig. 3(b). With further propagation,
see Fig. 2, the pulse starts to spread out again produc-
ing complicated spatial patterns. However, the compres-
sion in this scheme is a quasi-periodic process, and for
z = 97 we observe a clear signature of the second, less
pronounced, temporal and azimuthal compression. The
spatio-temporal (x, y, t) plot in Fig. 3(c) shows helical

tances before strong defragmentation of the transverse
proﬁle begins. If we change the detuning sign to j = 1
(focusing nonlinearity), then the spatiotemporal dynam-
ics is qualitatively diﬀerent. The compression eﬀect is
absent and with the same initial conditions we observed
small scale spatial modulational instability and subse-
quent self-focusing of the emerging ﬁlaments developing
at z > 30.

Self-focusing nonlinearity balanced by diﬀraction sug-
gests the possibility of spatial solitons. Indeed, the lat-
ter have been recently reported for the simplest case
of a two-component Raman model [18], while Raman
self-focusing has been seen experimentally [19]. The
question, which is relevant for our problem, is whether
multi-frequency solitons carrying OAM can be found.
To ﬁnd these structures we assumed that En(x, y, z) =
fn(r)einθ+i(κ1+nκ2)z, substituted it into Eqs.
(1) and
solved the nonlinear system of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions for fn(r) numerically. κ1,2 are the soliton pa-
rameters chosen to ensure decay of the soliton tails for
r
. The boundary conditions used at r = 0 are
limr→0 fnr−|n| = constn. Using this approach we have
found a two-parameter (κ1, κ2) family of solitons, one
example of which is shown in Fig. 4(a). The total in-
tensity corresponding to this solution has a helical pro-
ﬁle in both (x, y, t) (not shown, but it is similar to Fig.

suﬃciently small values of µ (implying suﬃciently large
values of the intensity) are robust with respect to small
perturbations, see Fig. 4(b). Taking larger values of µ
leads to excitation of internal oscillations and wobbling
helical trajectories, see Fig. 4(c). Notably, experimen-
tally realistic excitation, by just two beams with l0 = 0,
l1 = 1, leads to the emergence of structures very close to
the found soliton solutions, see Fig. 4(d). This is provid-
ing that the input beams are suﬃciently narrow, so that
the diﬀraction length is short in comparison to the dis-
persion length and the self-focusing kicks in before GVD
desynchronizes the phases of the harmonics.

The helical soliton beams reported here are qualita-
tively diﬀerent from the so-called spiralling solitons or
rotating soliton clusters [20], which sustain their rota-
tion due to the interaction between the individual beams
accompanied by the conservation of the angular momen-
tum. In our case the helical evolution does not require
the presence of more than one intensity lobe and orig-
inates from the interaction of multiple frequency har-
monics carrying progressively growing OAM. Ref.
[21]
studied complex spatial patterns emerging from the lin-
early interacting vortex beams carrying diﬀerent OAM,
but having identical frequencies. Multicomponent spa-
tial solitons carrying OAM have been reported in [22]
for a nonlinearity which does not depend on the relative
phases of the interacting harmonics, so that the four-
wave mixing mediated interaction of the beams has not
been included (incoherent interaction). In this case, the
OAM of individual components can be arbitrary, i.e.
it
is not controlled by any selection rules, and higher order

vortices can not be generated by the system itself.

In summary: We have demonstrated that a cascaded
four-wave mixing process in an oﬀ-resonantly excited Ra-
man medium with one of the two input ﬁelds being an
optical vortex leads to generation of multiply charged op-
tical vortices. Each newly generated vortex beam has its
own frequency creating strong dependence between the
spatial and temporal degrees of freedom, which can be
used for new forms of optical wave synthesis. In partic-
ular, we have demonstrated the generation of simultane-
ous azimuthally and temporally compressed pulses on the
defocusing side of the resonance and helical optical soli-
tons on the focusing side. The suggested technique and
observed eﬀects pave the way for practical implementa-
tions of spatial wave shaping using methods of spectral
synthesis, which could be also applicable to other types
of optical materials and for waves of a diﬀerent nature.

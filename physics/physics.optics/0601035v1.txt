Abstract

Based on boundary condition and hyperbolic dispersion relation, the superluminal group velocity

in an anisotropic metamaterial (AMM) is investigated. The superluminal propagation is induced by

the hyperbolic dispersion relation associated with the anisotropic AMM. It shown that a modulated

Gaussian beam undergoes superluminal group velocity which depends on the choice of incident and

optical axis angles. The superluminal prpagation does not violate the theory of special relativity

because the group velocity is the velocity of the peak of the localized wave packet which does

not carry information. It shown that an triglycine sulfate (TGS) crystal can be designed and the

superluminal group velocity can be measured experimentally.

INTRODUCTION

In 1968, Veselago ﬁrstly introduced the concept of left-handed material (LHM) in which

both the permittivity ε and the permeability µ are simultaneously negative [1]. Veselago

predicted that LHM would have unique and potentially interesting properties, such as the

negative refractive index, the reversed Doppler shift and the backward Cerenkov radiation.

LHM did not receive much attention as it only existed in conceptual form. After the ﬁrst

experimental observation using a metamaterial composed of split ring resonators (SRR) [2,

3], the study of such materials receive has increased tremendously attention in literature

over the last few years. Although some arguments have been evoked on the concepts of

negative refractive index [4, 5], the phenomenon of negative refraction has been examined

and conﬁrmed by many researchers

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. As noted earlier, both ǫ and µ are

necessary temporal dispersive in LHM. Since the temporal dispersion is important, the

superluminal propagation of a pulse in a LHM takes place [11, 12, 13].

While negative refraction is most easily visualized in an isotropic material with negative

refractive index, negative refraction can also be realized in anisotropic metamaterial (AMM)

for which not all elements of the diagonal permittivity and permeability tensors have the

same sign [14, 15, 16, 17]. In AMM the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld H and wave vector

k cannot form a strictly left-handed system. Recently, Smith et al show experimentally that

an AMM slab designed to provide a permeability equal to

1 along the optical axis, will

−

redirect E-polarized electromagnetic waves from a nearby source to a partial focus [18, 19].

In the present work, we will investigate the superluminal group velocity of waves in

an AMM. The superluminal propagation is induced by the hyperbolic dispersion relations

associated with the AMM. We describe a modulated Gaussian beam incident on triglycine

sulfate (TGS) crystal, which demonstrates in a straightforward manner that the peak of the

localized wave packet displays interesting superluminal behavior.

II. HYPERBOLIC DISPERSIVE RELATION

For anisotropic materials, one or both of the permittivity and permeability are second-

rank tensors. We assume that the permittivity and permeability tensors are simultaneously

diagonalizable. If we take the optical axis as the z axis, the permittivity and permeability

where εi and µi are the relative permittivity and permeability constants in the principal

coordinate system (i = x, y, z). It should be noted that the real AMM constructed by SRR

is highly dispersive, both in spatial sense and temporal sense [18, 19, 20]. So these relative

values are functions of the radial frequency ω. A general study on the shape of the dispersive

relation as function of the sign of these parameters has already been oﬀered in Ref. [17]. In

this paper, we are interested in the case of AMM with hyperbolic dispersion relation.

Without loss of generality, we assume the wave vector locate in the x

z plane (ky = 0).

Maxwell’s equations yield a scalar wave equation for magnetic ﬁeld Hy. In free space, the

accompanying dispersion relation has the familiar form

where kx and kz are the x and z components of the propagating wave vector, ω is the

We show the dispersion geometry in Fig. 1, where a plane electromagnetic wave is incident

from free space into an AMM. We choose the z axis to be normal to the interface, the x axis

in the plane of the ﬁgure, and the y axis out of the plane of the ﬁgure.

We assume here that the electric ﬁeld is polarized along the y axis out of plane. The

z-component of the wave vector can be found by the solution of Eq. (3), which yields

this choice of sign ensures that light power propagates away from the surface to the +z

direction. Due to the anisotropy, the transmitted wave components may refract at slightly

diﬀerent angles. The values of refractive wave vector can be found by using the boundary

condition and hyperbolic dispersive relation.

We now determine the angle of phase refraction. The incident angle of light in free space
is θI = tan−1(kx/kz), and the refractive angle of the transmitted wave vector in AMM can
be found by θT = tan−1(qx/qz). From the boundary condition at the interface z = 0, the

tangential components of the wave vectors must be continuous, i.e. qx = kx.

It is well known that the group velocity in anisotropic media diﬀers from the direction of

its wave vector. The group velocity is a very important physical quantity because it identiﬁes

the speed of the maximum intensity of wave packet. The group velocity in anisotropic media

can be deﬁned as [23, 24]

vg =

qω(q) =

where

q denotes the gradient of ω(q) in the wave vector space, ex and ez are unit cartesian

vectors. Because the anisotropy in LHM, vg =

qω(q) is not necessarily parallel to the wave

∇

∇

vector q.

The group velocity speciﬁes the velocity of the peak of the the wave group, and is not

necessarily parallel to the wave vector. When the interface is aligned an angle with the

optical axes of the AMM, the hyperbolic dispersion relations will exhibit some interesting

eﬀect. As shown in Fig. 1 the magnitude of q varies as a function of its direction. When the

refractive wave vector q approximately parallel to the asymptotic line of hyperbola(dash-

dot-doted line), q can be very large. The wave front travel in AMM with the velocity of

vp = ω/q, so the ultra-slow phase velocity can be expected in the medium with hyperbolic

dispersion relation. The diﬀerence in the phase and group velocities caused by media that

are anisotropy. The waves propagate in diﬀerent directions or in an anisotropic medium,

δq may not be parallel to q. Therefore, the group velocity is generally not parallel to the

phase velocity. If q propagates in some special direction, δq

0 and the superluminal group

→

velocity can be deduced. It should be mentioned that the interesting properties never exist

in the medium with circle or ellipse dispersion relation.

III. SUPERLUMINAL GROUP PROPAGATION

The positivity of the electromagnetic energy imposes that the SRR presents temporal

dispersion. This, in turn, conveys that actual anisotropic SRR be highly loss. So the super-

luminal group velocity is not easily experimentally veriﬁed in SRR metamaterial. However,

an extremely promising material, such as TGS crystal, satisfy the condition εx > 0, εz < 0.

In principle, at far infrared frequencies due to polarization dependence of certain phonon res-

onances, the materials with suitably low absorption exist [26, 27, 28, 29]. Thus an TGS slab

can be prepared at low temperatures and the superluminal group velocity can be measured.

Based on the dispersive relation of Eq. (3), one can derive the group velocity as

c(2αqx + γqz)ex + c(γqx + 2βqz)ez

If the width of the distribution q(k) is small compared to the range of k over which k0

varies signiﬁcantly, we can obtain a good approximation simply evaluate this quantity at

¯q(k) = q(k0). In Fig. 2, the group velocity in AMM is plotted. It should be noted that the

superluminal group velocity in the AMM is induced by the hyperbolic dispersion relations.

The superluminal group velocity does not means the propagation of energy will be superlu-

minal. Using the new deﬁnition of electric and magnetic energy [21, 22], the energy velocity

can not superluminal and the conservation of energy is not violated in AMM.

It should be noted that a wave group can be formed from planes with diﬀerent frequencies

ω or from plane waves with diﬀerent k vectors [24]. To obtain a better physical picture of

superluminal group velocity in AMM, a modulated Gaussian beam of ﬁnite width can be

constructed. Consider such a modulated beam incident from free space, for completeness,

let us consider a modulated beams given by

where k⊥ is perpendicular to k0 and ω0 = ck0. A general incident wave vector is written as

by Lu et al. [25], we assumes its Gaussian weight is

where a is the spatial extent of the incident beam. We want the modulated Gaussian beam

to be aligned with the incident direction deﬁned by the vector k0 = k0 cos θI ex + k0 sin θIez,

which makes an angle θI with the surface normal.

incident wave packet is a = 1. The peak of localized wave packet travels from point 1 to point 2

during a cycle ∆t with superluminal group velocity. The anisotropic parameters are same as those

used in Fig. 2.

Due to the anisotropy, the transmitted wave components may refract at slightly diﬀerent

angles. When the beam enters the AMM, it will no longer maintain Gaussian, it will be a

localized wave packet. Matching the boundary conditions for each k component at z = 0

gives the complex ﬁeld in the form

where T (k) is the transmission coeﬃcient of the wave packet. The transmission coeﬃcient

can obtain a good approximation to simply evaluate this quantity at k0 and to put it outside

the integral. Then the transmission coeﬃcient of the wave packet is simply given by T (k0).

The transmission coeﬃcients of the wave packet with diﬀerent optical angle are plotted in

Fig. 3. One can ﬁnd the transmission ﬁeld will be obvious if the incident angle not very

large. qz can be expanded in a Taylor series to ﬁrst order in k0 to a better approximation

A closer look at peak of localized wave packet shows that the superluminal propagation

of the peak is induced by hyperbolic dispersion relations. Fig. 3 shows a closes view of the

electric ﬁeld spatial distribution during the wave packet propagating in the AMM. In a circle

∆t = 2π/ω0 of the modulated Gaussian beam, the peak of localized wave packet travels from

point 1 to point 2. In Fig. 3 we set the center wave vector with a incident angles θI =

In the

∆t = 0.094ns, the peak of wave packet moves from (1.284, 2.571) to (3.144, 6.147). This

propagating velocity corresponds to 0.427m/ns, which is almost exactly the analytical group

velocity of 1.424c in Eq. (7), and the supluminal group velocity is demonstrated theoretically.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

It should be noted that the cause of the superluminal group velocity described in isotropic

LHM [11, 12, 13] or ultracold gas of atoms [30, 31, 32] has completely diﬀerent origin because

in those cases the superluminality is caused by the frequency dispersion of the medium. In

the case discussed above, the superluminal group velocity in the medium is induced by

the hyperbolic dispersive relation and it arises in AMM. As far as we know, this kind of

superluminal group velocity was not recognized before. It should be mentioned, however,

that the shape of localized wave packet is distorted once the modulated Gaussian beam

incident on an AMM. Our results do not violate causality or special relativity, because the

group velocity is the velocity of the peak of the wave packet. The intensity maximum could

move faster than c, which does not carry information. It shown that an TGS crystal slab

can be designed and the superluminal group velocity can be measured experimentally.

We present a generalization of the coupled dipole method to the scattering of light by arbitrary
periodic structures. This new formulation of the coupled dipole method relies on the same direct-
space discretization scheme that is widely used to study the scattering of light by ﬁnite objects.
Therefore, all the knowledge acquired previously for ﬁnite systems can be transposed to the study
of periodic structures.

I. INTRODUCTION

In its original form, the coupled dipole method (CDM)
was developed for the study, in free-space, of the scatter-
ing of light by an object with ﬁnite dimensions.1,2 The
method was subsequently extended to deal with objects
near a substrate3,4 or inside a multilayer system.5 The
principle of the method is always the same: the object is
represented by a cubic array of N polarizable subunits,
each with a size small enough compared to the spatial
variations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld for the dipole ap-
proximation to apply.
If the CDM could be extended
to deal with local scatterers near periodic structures, the
CDM could then also be used, for example, to study light
scattering by objects near surface gratings or by defects
or cavities in photonic crystals. The ﬁrst step toward
such an extension is to develop a form of the CDM ca-
pable of describing periodic structures eﬃciently. In this
paper, we present a generalization of the CDM to arbi-
trary periodic structures.

II. SELF-CONSISTENT FIELD FOR A PERIODIC
STRUCTURE

We consider a plane substrate occupying the region
z
0. For a single object on the substrate, the self-
consistent ﬁeld at the ith subunit at location ri is given
by

≤

E(ri, ω) = E0(ri, ω) +

[S(ri, rj, ω)

N

j=1
X

+ F(ri, rj, ω)]αj(ω)E(rj, ω).

(1)

where E0(ri, ω) is the (initial) ﬁeld at ri in the absence
of the scattering object. Note that none of the subunits
lies in the plane z = 0. The tensors F and S are the

ﬁeld susceptibilities (linear responses) associated with
the free space6 and the substrate.7 αi(ω) is the dynamic
polarizability of the ith subunit and includes radiation
reaction.2,8 The self-consistent ﬁeld E(ri, ω) is found by
solving the symmetric linear system formed by writing
Eq. (1) for i = 1, N . The total ﬁeld at position r is
computed as

E(r, ω) = E0(r, ω) +

[S(r, rj, ω)

N

j=1
X

+ F(r, rj, ω)]αj(ω)E(rj, ω).

(2)

This conventional form of the CDM is well adapted to
deal with localized objects. If, instead of a single object,
one wants to study a periodic structure created by the
repetition of the object over a lattice located above the
substrate, Eq. (1) becomes

E(ri, ω) = E0(ri, ω)

The vectors u and v are the basis vectors of the lattice
(Fig. 1). The index i runs over all the subunits of the
structure. ri is the position of subunit i. The sum over j
is restricted to the N subunits of a single object with po-
sition ¯rj inside the object. The number of subunits is now
inﬁnite, and therefore so is the size of the linear system to
be solved. One solution would be to truncate the inﬁnite
sum and solve the system for a large but ﬁnite number
of objects, but this is impractical because the sums over
the lattice converge very slowly. This problem can be cir-
cumvented by using a plane-wave decomposition of the
incident ﬁeld. In the case of plane-wave (propagating or
evanescent) illumination, the ﬁeld above the surface can
be written as (we note by k0k the projection of vector k0
on a plane parallel to the surface)

E0(¯ri + mu + nv, ω) = E0(¯ri, ω) exp[ik0k.(mu + nv)]

(4)

where k0 is the wave vector in free space. Because of the
periodicity of the system and the translational invariance
of the ﬁeld susceptibilities, the self consistent ﬁeld satis-
ﬁes the same relation as the incident ﬁeld (Eq. (4)), and
at any subunit Eq. (3) can be written as

E(ri, ω) = E0(ri, ω)

[S(ri, ¯rj + mu + nv, ω)

+ F(ri, ¯rj + mu + nv, ω)] exp[ik0k.(mu + nv)]

αj(ω)E(¯rj, ω).

The self-consistent ﬁeld on the right-hand side of Eq.(5)
is independent of (m,n) and can be taken out of the in-
ﬁnite sum. Hence the sum over subunits in Eq.(5) only
involves j = 1, N , that is the number of subunits in a unit
cell, which we choose to be the cell for which m = n = 0.
Moreover, because of the translational symmetry of the
self-consistent ﬁeld, we only need to ﬁnd E in one cell.
Once the self-consistent ﬁeld is found in the central cell,
the ﬁeld in any other cell is obtained by multiplying by
the appropriate phase factor. Thus we only have to solve
a linear system of the same size as the one describing a
single object. The major issue in solving Eq. (5) is to
compute eﬃciently the inﬁnite, slowly convergent sums
without performing a truncation of the sums. This is
possible owing to the translational invariance of the ﬁeld-
susceptibilities in a plane parallel to the surface. The
dependence on (¯ri, ¯rj, ω) can be written as (ρij , zi, zj, ω)
¯rj)k. Hence, the inﬁnite sums of Eq.(5)
with ρij = (¯ri −
become:

reﬂection coeﬃcients for the substrate. Sums involving
diﬀerent susceptibility tensors (free-space or surface) will
have a diﬀerent behavior, due to the diﬀerent arguments
of the exponential terms (zi + zj and
). They will
be computed separately.

For the surface term, the convergence of the sum is en-
sured by the exponential term. As m and n increase, the
magnitude of kk increases and the nature of the plane
wave changes from propagating to evanescent. Because
zi +zj never vanishes, and because the subunits are never

and

exactly on the surface, this exponential term is always
present and ensures the rapid convergence of the sum.

zi−

For the free-space part, the argument of the exponen-
tial term is
and the rapid convergence of the sums
is not as trivial. We use the method introduced to derive
the Green function of a 2D square grating.9 We consider
two cases. The ﬁrst case pertains to the interaction be-
tween elements from diﬀerent “layers” of the lattice, and
= zj. This case is similar to
corresponds to the case zi 6
the surface problem and the convergence of the sum is
ensured by the exponential term.

In the second case zi = zj and the exponential term
disappears. We cast the free-space part of the inﬁnite
sum in two diﬀerent forms. We note by a(rk, zi −
zj) the
sum in the direct space (F terms in Eq.(6)). We note by
zj) the sum in the reciprocal space (G terms
A(kk, zi −
in Eq.(8)). When zi = zj we write the sum as

a(rk, 0) = A(kk, h) + [a(rk, 0)

a(rk, h)],

(11)

−

where h is an oﬀset parameter. The auxiliary sum
A(kk, h) can be computed eﬃciently owing to the pres-
ence of an exponentially decreasing term. The diﬀerence
of direct-space sums a(rk, 0)
k and
can also be computed eﬃciently. With Eq.(11) we can
ensure a rapid convergence of the sums in a discretization
plane despite the absence of an exponentially decreasing
term in the original sum.

a(rk, h) goes as 1/r2

−

To improve further the convergence of the sums, we use
Shanks’ accelerator.10 Because we have two sums (over
m and n) one solution would be to apply successively
Shanks’ accelerator to the inner (n) and outer (m) sums
(as suggested in Ref. 11). The problem with this ap-
proach is that in our case, the convergence of the inner
sum (over n) can be very slow for high values of m (outer
sum). A better solution consists in deﬁning one element
l of the Shanks’s series as the sum over m =
l, l for
1.
n =
This strategy gets rid of the inner/outer sum problem
and results in a faster convergence and an easier imple-
mentation of the Shanks algorithm.

l, l for m =

l + 1, ..., l

Note that there is another way of computing eﬃciently
the free-space term. As we did earlier, when we in-
troduced a parameter h, it is possible to split the in-
ﬁnite sum (F) terms in Eq.(6) in two parts; one in
the direct space and one in the reciprocal space, where
these two sums converge quickly owing to a damping
function.12,13 The convergence is the best when h =
vxuy). Poppe et al. introduced this method
to study the optical response of an atomic monolayer; the
p
period of the structure was therefore very small compared
to the wavelength.

π/(uxvy −

Once the periodic susceptibility tensors are known,
we solve the linear system of Eq.
(5) to ﬁnd the self-
consistent ﬁeld at each site. Once the ﬁeld at all subunits
is known, the scattered ﬁeld at any position r, above, be-
low or inside the periodic structures is readily computed
ri. Notice that
through Eq.(5) with the exchange r

↔

the new linear system is no longer symmetric. This is
due to the fact that the elements of the system depend
on the incident plane wave via the exponential term in
Eq.(5).

III. EXAMPLE: SCATTERING BY A PERIODIC
STRUCTURE LYING ON A SUBSTRATE

To illustrate the method we consider the case of a di-
electric substrate (the relative permittivity is 2.25) on
which lies a 2D grating of parallelepipeds with the same
permittivity. The structure is illuminated in TM po-
larization from the substrate side by total internal re-
ﬂection at an angle of incidence θ = 45◦; then k0k =
( 2π
λ sin θ√2.25, 0). The wavelength in vacuum is λ =
632.8 nm, and the basis vectors of the lattice u = (a, 0),
v = (0, a).

The parallelepipeds have a square base of 40

40 nm2,
and a height of 20 nm (see inset Fig. 2). In Fig. 2 we
present the intensity of the electric ﬁeld along the x-axis,
60 nm above the dielectric substrate for diﬀerent value of
a. The curves are obtained for N = 256, hence the size of
5 nm3 (but convergence is already
the subunit is 5
achieved for N = 32). Notice that the solid line is for an
isolated parallelepiped on the substrate, i.e., the electric
ﬁeld is computed with the conventional CDM.4 When a

tably diﬀerent from the single object case. This denotes
a strong coupling between parallelepipeds. Conversely
for large a (a = 1000 nm), the curve is very similar to
the curve for an isolated parallelepiped.

Table 1 presents the computation time for the coeﬃ-

cients of the linear system (Eq. (6)) used to solve Eq.
(5), for diﬀerent values of N , and three values of a. The
factor h has an important inﬂuence on the computation
time, therefore we have chosen the optimal value of h for
each case. As a reference we use the conventional CDM
to compute the ﬁeld for a single parallelepiped.14

TABLE I. Computation time in seconds for the coeﬃcients of the linear system (Eq. (6)) used to solve Eq. (5). N is the
number of subunits. CDM is the time for the classical CDM for one parallelepiped. CDM1 is the time for the periodic CDM
when the free space contribution is computed with Eq.(8), and CDM2 is the time for the periodic CDM when the free space
−3
contribution is computed with Ref.[12]. The inﬁnite sums of the series are stopped when the relative error is less than 10
(10

−6).

Table 1 shows three computation times: CDM is the
time for the classical CDM for one parallelepiped. CDM1
is the time for the periodic CDM when the free space
contribution is computed with Eq.(8), and CDM2 is the
time for the periodic CDM when the free space contri-
bution is computed with Ref.[12]. CDM2 is faster than
CDM1 for small periods. For a = 1µm the computa-
tion times are similar. For larger periods CDM2 fails to
converge to the reference result because the method of
Ref.[12] used to compute the free space term does not
work well for large a. We note that the computation
time increases with a. This is due mainly to the surface
term. The convergence of the series depends on the term
exp[iw0(zi + zj)]. In our case the modulus of the vectors
u′
of the reciprocal basis are
= 2π/a. Hence when
|
|
a decreases, the modulus of the vector basis increases, w0
becomes imaginary for smaller values of (m, n), and the
exponential term produces a stronger damping. Obvi-
ously, when N increases, the computation time increases
due to the increased number of subunits involved. But
there is another eﬀect of the surface term. As the size
of the subunit becomes smaller (N increases), there are
more subunits close to the substrate with a small value
of zi + zj and a slower exponential decay. When we com-
pare the classical CDM to the periodic CDM we see that
for a smaller than 200 nm the computation time of the
periodic CDM is shorter. When the size of the period be-
comes larger than the wavelength used, the convergence
becomes slower.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion we have generalized the coupled dipole
method (CDM) to periodic structures. We have dis-
cussed explicitly the case of a three-dimensional struc-
ture, periodic in two directions, placed on a substrate.
However, the principle of the approach described here ap-
plies to a broad range of conﬁgurations with one, two or
three-dimensional structures. The main advantage of this
new formulation is that it relies on the same straightfor-
ward, direct-space discretization scheme that is used for
a single localized object. Therefore, all the knowledge ac-
quired previously in CDM modeling of ﬁnite systems can
be transposed to the study of periodic structures.15 Opti-
cal anisotropy, for instance, can be included by taking the
appropriate permittivity tensor. Also, as shown here, the
symmetry of the periodic lattice can be arbitrary. Here,
we have considered the case of plane wave illumination.
In the case of arbitrary illumination, each spectral com-
ponent of the incident ﬁeld must be treated individually.
An interesting extension of the present work would be
to merge the periodic CDM and the conventional CDM
into a single approach to light scattering. This would be
particularly useful in dealing with localized defects in pe-
riodic structures or the interaction between a near-ﬁeld
probe (microscope tip, ﬂuorescing particle,...) and a pe-
riodic system. The periodic generalization of the coupled
dipole method can also be used to draw a better physical
picture of the local-ﬁeld corrections that appear during
the multiple scattering of light by a discrete set of scat-
terers.16

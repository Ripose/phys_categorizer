Limitations to bit-rate and spatial capacity of an optical data transmission channel

The maximum bit-rate of a slab waveguide is ultimately determined by the waveguide dispersion. We show that
while the maximum bit rate in a waveguide is inversely proportional to the waveguide’s width, bit rate per unit
width (i.e., spatial capacity) decreases, and in the limit of a zero-width waveguide it converges to ∼ ω/
(λL)
(where L is the length and ω and λ are the beam’s frequency and wavelength respectively). This result, which
is independent of the waveguide’s refractive indices, is qualitatively equivalent to the transmission rate per unit
of width in free space. We also show that in a 3D waveguide (e.g., ﬁbers), unlike free space, the spatial capacity
vanishes in the same limit.

The importance of maximizing the transmission rate of
communication systems is well recognized. There is also a
growing interest in short-distance, yet high bit-rate, wire-
less systems [1]. However, due to the beam divergence in
free space the bit-rate is not the only parameter relevant
to data transmission. The amount of data concentration
in space, known as spatial capacity(SC), is also a crucial
parameter.

There are many eﬀects which impair information trans-
fer in optical waveguides (slab waveguides or optical
ﬁbers), such as noise, absorption, scattering, dispersion
and nonlinear eﬀects. According to the Shannon for-
mula [2] and its more applied derivatives (see, for ex-
ample [3–5]) an information channel’s maximum bit rate
is mostly determined by the channel’s noise.

In the presence of Gaussian noise, the main problem
encountered in high data rate transmission is dispersion.
In practice the highest bit-rate is determined by the cri-
terion that the dispersion broadened pulse (which repre-
sents a digital bit) should not exceed its allocated slot
[6].

In a single-mode waveguide the dispersion is caused by
mainly three diﬀerent factors: material dispersion (MD),
polarization dispersion (PD) and waveguide dispersion
(WD). In the case of a wide waveguide, the WD is neg-
ligible, and the MD is the dominant factor (usually the
inﬂuence of PD is smaller) and absolutely large. How-
ever, if the cladding of the waveguide is made of free
space then the inﬂuence of the MD (and of PD) will de-
crease by narrowing the waveguide. It so happens, how-
ever, that reducing the waveguide width also decreases
the WD (even though it is still the dominant factor).
Therefore, by reducing the waveguide’s width, higher bit
rates are possible.

It seems, therefore, that the best transmission rate will
be achieved for a waveguide with zero width. This is a

erel.g@kailight.com

strange consequence since a zero-width waveguide should
not behave qualitatively diﬀerent than free space.

In this paper we will show that while the transmission
rate of a single slab waveguide does increase when its
width shrinks, the SC decreases, and in fact the SC for
zero-width waveguides is qualitatively similar to the SC
of free space. However, in three dimensions (e.g., ﬁber)
this is not the case and a 2D array of zero-width ﬁbers
has a diﬀerent SC than that of free space.

We begin with the simple model of a slab waveguide.
The index of refraction of such a waveguide can be writ-

For simplicity we choose the TE mode to describe wave

where ψ(x, z) satisﬁes the wave equation

In order to minimize chromatic dispersion we choose
air (or vacuum) as the waveguide’s cladding, i.e., n2 = 1
and k2 = k0
2π/λ. Therefore, we can use n1 = n and
the propagation constant is (for a

Thus, as the waveguide shrinks, a

dispersion decreases (since β
k0), and a higher bit-
rate, for a given ﬁber length, is attainable. One might
expect that the best transmission will be achieved for a
zero width wavelength. But this is counterintuitive, since
it would suggest that the best way to transmit informa-
tion is to do so in free space.

The problem with this reasoning lies in the fact, that

and therefore,

in order to avoid cross-talk between
two adjacent waveguides the distance between two such
waveguides should be increased. This would limit the
number of waveguides one can use in a given length (or,
more accurately, width).

This constant is universal in the sense that it is in-
dependent of the waveguide’s characteristics (it depends
neither on its width 2a not on its refractive index n).

The limiting result (14) is consistent with the limit of
information transmission in free space, as we now show.
In free space dispersion is not a limitation, however SC
will be limited by beam divergence. For Gaussian beams,
which possess the smallest divergence, SC will be max-
imized when transmitting in the confocal conﬁguration.
In this case, as shown in Fig.3, the waist is positioned ex-
actly at L/2 and is equal to w/√2, where w is the beam’s

In the case of ﬁbers (i.e., 3D) however, the SC vanishes
in the limit of a zero width waveguide, and is therefore

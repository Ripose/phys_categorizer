Abstract. We consider a recently reported micro-ﬂuidic dye ring laser and study
the full wave nature of TE modes in the cavity by means of ﬁnite-element simulations.
The resonance wave-patterns of the cavity modes support a ray-tracing view and we
are also able to explain the spectrum in terms of standing waves with a mode spacing
δk = 2π/Leﬀ where Leﬀ is the eﬀective optical path length in the cavity.

1. Introduction

Compact, eﬃcient, and on-chip light-sources are of considerable interest for use in lab-
on-a-chip applications [1] and recently there has been an increasing eﬀort in realizing
micro-ﬂuidic dye lasers based on glass or polymer [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Typically, the cavity designs rely on classical ray-tracing arguments rather than full
wave simulations. In this paper we consider a geometry resembling that of Refs. [3, 5, 6]
and oﬀer a full wave study of the TE modes in the cavity. The resonance wave-patterns
of the cavity modes support the ray-tracing view and we are also able to explain the
mode-spacing of the spectrum in terms of standing waves.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we present the geometry, in Sec. 3
we address the mode spacing by quasi one-dimensional considerations, in Sec. 4 we
numerically solve the wave equation, and in Sec. 5 we discuss aspects of optical gain.
Finally, in Sec. 6 conclusions are given.

2. Geometry

We consider the two-dimensional laser resonator illustrated in Fig. 1 which corresponds
to the planar cavities studied experimentally in Refs. [3, 5, 6]. The cavity resembles
a classical Fabry-Perot resonator and consists of two dielectric isosceles triangles with

polymer region where the output power is evaluated by an integral along the solid
line γ. The dashed line indicates a typical optical path in the cavity. Simulations are
carried out for point-source excitations at positions A, B, and C, respectively.

baseline ℓpol and refractive index npol separated by a microﬂuidic channel of width ℓch
containing a ﬂuid with refractive index nch. Light is conﬁned to the cavity by total-
internal reﬂections at the polymer-air interfaces at an angle of incidence of π/4. Out
coupling of power occurs through an evanescent-ﬁeld coupling to an adjacent polymer
region. In the experiments in Refs. [5, 6] the microﬂuidic channel is ﬁlled by a dye doped
liquid acting as gain medium. In Ref. [5] ℓpol ∼ 700 µm, the cavity is pumped at the
wavelength λ = 532 nm by a pulsed frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser, and lasing occurs
in the visible around λ ∼ 570 nm. For details on the pump power and lasing threshold
we refer to Ref. [5].

Throughout the rest of the paper we consider a typical structure with ℓch/ℓpol = 0.2
and for the evanescent-ﬁeld coupling we have w/ℓpol ≃ 0.028 for the width w of the air
gap. For the refractive indices we use npol = 1.6 and nch = 1.43. These numbers give
an index step which is typical for a liquid and a polymer. However, we emphasize that
the particular choice of numbers do not aﬀect our overall ﬁndings and conclusions.

3. Quasi one-dimensional approach to mode spacing

We ﬁrst estimate the mode spacing by considering a plane wave travelling around in the
cavity, see Fig. 1. In this ray-tracing like approach we neglect reﬂections at the polymer-
ﬂuid interfaces which is justiﬁed by the very small Fresnel reﬂection probability

R =

npol − nch
npol + nch (cid:19)

(cid:18)

≃ 0.31 %

We imagine modes somewhat similar to whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in resonators
of circular shape. However, in this case the modes are subject to four total-internal
reﬂections at an incidence angle of π/4 irrespectively of the mode-index and all modes
have the same eﬀective optical path length. Contrary to WGMs these modes have
thus no cut-oﬀ for decreasing mode index caused by decreasing incidence angle. The
accumulated phase during one round-trip of a plane-wave in the ring cavity is

δφ = kLeﬀ + ϕ

where k = 2π/λ = ω/c is the free-space wave number,

Leﬀ = 2npolℓpol + 2nchℓch

is the eﬀective optical path length in the cavity, and

interfaces at incidence angle of π/4. The resonance condition is δφ = 2πm with the

4. Two-dimensional wave equation approach

The full wave nature is governed by the wave equation [8]
∇ × ∇ × ~E(~r) = ǫ(~r)k2 ~E(~r)

(7)
where ~E is the electrical ﬁeld and ǫ(~r) = n2(~r) is the dielectric function. We solve
~E(~r) = Ez(~r)~ez and
the wave equation in a planar geometry for TE modes,
~r = x~ex + y~ey. For the simulations we employ a ﬁnite-element method [9] with ”open”
boundary conditions taken into account by perfectly matching layers (PMLs) at the
edges of the simulation domain [10], see Fig. 1. This allows outgoing waves with
negligible back reﬂection.

i.e.

We solve Eq. (7) subject to a point-source excitation and modes are monitored
by calculating the output power Pout(k) by integration along γ in the polymer region
adjacent to the cavity, see Fig. 1, for diﬀerent values of k. The point-source has the
appealing feature that it radiates isotropically in a homogeneous space and thus it will
in general excite the full spectrum of cavity eigenmodes (except of course from the
statistically few having a true node at the exact position of the point-source).

In order to compare to the predicted mode spectrum, we have transformed the k

values into a mode index

m(k) = (kLeﬀ + ϕ)/2π

(8)

and according to Eq. (5) we expect Pout(m) to have resonances centred at integer values
of m. Fig. 2 illustrates this in the case of a point-source excitation at point A, see Fig. 1.
The over-all agreement between the full wave simulation and the quasi one-
dimensional model is excellent, but from Fig. 2 it is also clear that the diﬀerent peaks
are slightly blue-shifted from integer values. The top panels illustrate this for two of the
peaks indicated by green and red in the lower panel. This small shift may originate in a
slightly modiﬁed phase shift at the edge with evanescent ﬁeld coupling compared to the
three other edges of the cavity. The small Fresnel reﬂection may also slightly modify
the spectrum compared to the results derived from the quasi one-dimensional model.

Figure 2 shows results in the range from m ∼ 18 up to m ∼ 29. When
further increasing m the pattern of peaks persist with a small tendency that the
peaks sharpen. This trend has been investigated up m ∼ 100 where simulations turn
highly computationally demanding (results not shown). However, since the quasi one-
dimensional interpretation does not support a cut-oﬀ for increasing m we believe that
a spectrum of equally spaced modes persist for increasing m.

For decreasing m WGMs will typically experience a cut-oﬀ because the angles of
incidence at some point do not support total-internal reﬂection. However, as discussed
for the quasi one-dimensional model the particular class of modes in the present cavity do
not share this property. In fact, in the simulations we have observed the modes down to
m ∼ 10 below which pronounced deviations from the quasi one-dimensional predictions
start to emerge. Deviations most likely appear because the polymer-air interface has
spatial variations on a length scale comparable to the wavelength of the light. In other

words, the ray-tracing picture fails and concepts like total-internal reﬂection derived
from Snell’s law do not accurately capture the true wave physics.

In order to verify that the peaks in Fig. 2 really do correspond to cavity modes we
have studied the corresponding electrical ﬁelds at resonance, see Fig. 3. These ﬁelds
resemble pure eigenfunctions of the resonator while oﬀ-resonance ﬁelds correspond to
linear combinations of a larger number of eigenfunctions. Starting from e.g. the source
point, the number of oscillations along one round trip equals m in full agreement with
the quasi one-dimensional arguments.

When the cavity is excited at diﬀerent positions the overall output spectrum is
the same such that peaks remain unshifted while changes are observed in the intensity
distribution only. The reason is that diﬀerent positions of the source will excite diﬀerent
linear combinations of eigenmodes (being correlated with the intensity level) while the
eigenspectrum itself (being correlated with the resonance positions) remains unchanged.
In Fig. 4 we illustrate this for diﬀerent positions of the point source. The spectrum also
reveals structure, though very broad with low intensity, in between integer values of
m(k). This structure also corresponds to quasi eigenmodes which however are much
more poorly conﬁned to the cavity compared to the well-conﬁned modes with integer
values of m(k).

5. Optical gain medium

Lasing of course relies on the presence of an optical gain medium. In Refs. [3, 5] dissolved
laser dye in the microﬂuidic channel provides the gain. While the dynamics of lasing
is diﬃcult to address we may with little eﬀort investigate the inﬂuence of gain on the
mode spectrum. The present numerical model allows for such investigations, but for low

concentrations general trends may be more easily analyzed with the aid of perturbation
theory [11]. Doping by e.g. Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G), as in the experiment [5], will change
the refractive index in the channel accordingly, i.e. nch → nch + nRh6G where for the

6. Discussion and conclusion

In this work we have used ﬁnite-element simulations to study the cavity mode spectrum
of a micro-ﬂuidic dye ring laser with a planar geometry resembling the one studied
experimentally in Refs. [3, 5]. We have performed a full wave study of the TE modes

in the cavity and found very good agreement with a quasi one-dimensional plane wave
description with resonances corresponding to standing waves.

In principle our simulations allow for an estimate of the quality factor of the
modes, but realistic simulations for the experimental device require more details to
be taken into account. For instance one would need to include the three-dimensional
nature of the device to describe the radiation ﬁeld accurately and the details of the
evanescent ﬁeld coupling would also inﬂuence the quality factor. Such issues add to the
diﬃculty in addressing the dynamics of lasing so in this work we have only addressed
the passive device. However, we have estimated a doping-induced shift of the spectrum
by perturbative means.

In the simulations we have considered mode-indices m(k) up to around 100 while
in the experiments the corresponding typical mode index is estimated to be around
two orders of magnitude larger. Nevertheless, we are conﬁdent that the standing-wave
interpretation may be safely extrapolated to the experimental regime [3, 5, 6] due to
the scale invariance of the wave equation [8] and the fact that this class of modes has
no cut-oﬀ with respect to increasing mode index.

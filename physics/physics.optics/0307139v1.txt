Braided nodal lines in wave superpositions

H H Wills Physics Laboratory, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TL, UK

M R Dennis

Nodal

lines (phase singularities, optical vortices) are the generic interference

fringes of complex scalar waves. Here, an exact complex solution of the time in-

dependent wave equation (Helmholtz equation) is considered, possessing nodal lines

which are braided in the form of a borromean, or pig-tail braid. The braid ﬁeld is

a superposition of counterpropagating, counterrotating, non-coaxial order 3 Bessel

beams, and a plane wave whose propagation is perpendicular to that of the beams.

The construction is structurally stable, and can be generalized to a limited class of

other braids.

PACS numbers: 42.25.Hz,03.65.Vf,02.10.Kn

In three dimensional ﬁelds of interfering complex scalar waves, perfect destructive in-

terference, that is, where the total wave amplitude is zero, generically occurs along lines:

nodal lines. They are also called phase singularities, since the phase is undeﬁned when

the amplitude is zero, or wave dislocations [1, 2]. Nodal lines in waves are much studied,

particularly in solutions of the time independent (Helmholtz) wave equation, in which they

are stationary features of the interference pattern. They appear in a variety of physical con-

texts, including quantized vortex lines in solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation in quantum

mechanics [3], and optical vortices in scalar components of monochromatic electromagnetic

ﬁelds [2, 4], where their presence in optical beams often indicates the presence of orbital

angular momentum [5]. Generally, in interfering spatial ﬁelds, there are very many nodal

lines, tangled in a complicated way [6], reminiscent of the tangling of quantized vortices in

media such as turbulent superﬂuid helium [7].

Here, I shall demonstrate that a particular complex wave superposition (involving two
Bessel beams, deﬁned in equation (3) below, and a plane wave) contains braided nodal

lines. As shown in ﬁgure 1, the ﬁeld has three phase singularities whose trajectory, as z

increases, traces out a ﬁgure-8 in the transverse xy-plane, forming the well-known borromean

braid (also called the pigtail braid, or plait). This crafting of waves with a braided nodal

the x, y trajectories of the braid strands, and the structure is plotted to scale. Three z-periods are

plotted, between z = 0 and 6π/kz .

conﬁguration complements wave ﬁelds containing knotted and linked nodal lines in free

space [8, 9] and in the quantum mechanical electronic states of hydrogen [10]. Braiding

of nodal lines in light also complements Ref. [11], in which two laser beams in a plasma

were twisted into a double helix; the topology here is more complicated (the transverse

trajectory being a ﬁgure-8, rather than a circle), and occurs in linear ﬁelds in free space. The

topology of braided nodal lines is reminiscent of braided vortices in topological (magneto-)

hydrodynamics [12], and braided vortex trajectories in hamiltonian mechanics [13].

It is easy mathematically to ﬁnd complex scalar ﬁelds which contain various arrangements

of nodal lines [14], as products of separate complex functions for each nodal line. For each

such line, two independent real functions ξ(r), η(r), are found whose zero contours cross on

3

(1)

(2)

the desired line; the function ξ + iη has a nodal line in this position. For example, the ﬁeld

2

−

Yj=0

(x

sin 2(z + 2πj/3))

−

has three nodal lines, and as z increases, each executes a simple ﬁgure-8 Lissajous trajectory

in the xy-plane. The total ﬁeld is the product of three complex ﬁelds; it has the zeros of

each of its separate product terms, and the nodal structure of the total ﬁeld is braided.

However, such ﬁelds are not, in general, physically realisable as waves. That is, the ﬁeld

(1) does not satisfy the time independent Helmholtz equation

2ψ + k2ψ = 0.

∇

Nodal lines are usually studied in solutions of this equation because they are stationary,

even if the ﬁeld is changing periodically in time (as in optical ﬁelds).

In the following,

the wavenumber k will be set to 1. The most familiar set of solutions to (2) are plane

= 1; these do not themselves have phase singularities, although

Associated with phase singularities is a topological number, the topological current (or

strength). This is an integer, equal to the total phase change around the singularity divided

by 2π. The right-hand sense of phase increase around the line endows it with a direction; if

the nodal line crosses a plane at a nodal point, the associated topological charge is positive

if the sense of the line is out of the plane, negative if into [15]. A convenient set of solutions
of (2), which contain a strength m phase singularity up the z-axis are the Bessel beams

nent of the wavevector (ﬁxed by kz, since the total wavenumber is 1); the Bessel function

has a nodal line along x = y = 0. The second factor term in the product (3) gives an order

m phase singularity: if m > 0, the direction of the topological current is in the +z-direction,

if m < 0, it is in the

z-direction. The beam itself propagates in

z according to the

−

±

sign of kz. An advantage of using these nondiﬀracting singular beams here (instead of, for

example, Laguerre-Gauss beams) is that their structure in the z-direction is periodic with

period 2π/kz.

4

High order singularities, when

> 1, are not structurally stable. If a Bessel beam (3) is

m
|

|

perturbed by a function which breaks its azimuthal phase pattern, the singularity generically

unfolds to

unit strength nodes, wound as a helix; the singularities are convected by

m
|

|

the twisted phase structure of the beam. Unlike hydrodynamic vortices, phase singularity

vortices do not repel, but may cross, in a manner equivalent to reconnection of vortices in

superﬂuids [19]. The crossings themselves are not stable, and, on perturbation, break in

either of the two ways that conserve topological current [9].

The knot construction of Ref. [8] employed a superposition of n(n + 1)/2 parallel, coaxial

Bessel beams of the same order m, with diﬀerent kz and coeﬃcients, in order to make a

strength n nodal loop at ﬁxed radius from the beam axis, threaded by the strength m

axial nodal line. On perturbation by a J0 beam, the loop unfolds to give an (m, n) torus

knot or link, which winds around the z-axis m times as it winds around the original loop

position n times. The braid construction here employs a similar technique, by superposing

parallel Bessel beams, in this case counterpropagating and non-coaxial, to get a degenerate

conﬁguration, which unfolds to a braid after perturbation by an appropriately chosen plane

wave.

The solution ψbraid of (2), containing the braided nodal lines in ﬁgure 1, is given by

ψbraid(x, y, z) = ψ3(kz, x + d, y, z) + ψ3(

kz, x

d, y, z) + iε exp(

3. The reason for the particular choices (5) is

explained later. The ﬁrst two terms of (4) are order +3 Bessel beams of the form (3), the

ﬁrst propagating in +z and centered on the line x =

d, y = 0; the second propagates in

z, and is centered on x = +d, y = 0; the order 3 topological current in both beams is in

the +z direction. The third summand is a plane wave propagating in the y-direction. Since

these three waves propagate in very diﬀerent directions (+z,

z and y), the braid function

The conﬁguration of nodal lines of (6) in the vicinity of the z-axis is shown in ﬁgure 2. It

shows a series of tilted singularity rings encircling lines conﬁned to the x = 0 plane. The

±

The phase structure in the z = 0 plane is shown in ﬁgure 3. There is one singularity at the

origin (this is one of the threading curves in ﬁgure 2), and two others at x = 0, y =

3π/2.

These latter nodes are nongeneric, since not only are they zeros of the ﬁeld, but also places

where the x-derivative vanishes. This reﬂects the fact that in three dimensions, they are

crossings (7), shown in ﬁgure 2. The position of phases around the nongeneric singularities

is the same for each (e.g.

π/2 in

y directions, phase increases in the same sense around

∓

±

each).

The conﬁguration of singularities of ﬁgure 2 appears characteristic of the nodal pattern

of superposed non-coaxial Bessel beams which are counterrotating (i.e. counterpropagating

with parallel topological currents), and contains the basic structure of the three strand

ﬁgure-8 xy-trajectory desired for the braid. However, it is only with the particular choices

of (5) that the crossings occur at precisely the same z value, which is convenient for the

present purpose; increasing d slightly makes the two crossings migrate away from the z = 0

plane (and each other). d and kz were chosen in (5) so the crossings occur in the same planes

z = 0, π/kz (mod 2π/kz), and with a spacing of 3π in the y-coordinate. The crossings (7)

are broken when the perturbing plane wave iε exp(

iy) is included in (4).

−

The pair of crossings at z = 0 in (7) are separated by a distance of 3π; that is, one and a

half wavelengths of the plane wave. Thus, the phases of the plane wave at the positions of

the two z = 0 crossings of ψun diﬀer by π. This causes the two crossings to break in opposite

senses (ﬁgure 4), and the two zeros in the z = 0 plane of the braid ﬁeld are perturbed in

opposite directions, as in ﬁgure 5. Moreover, at z = π/kz (half the z-period), all of the

phases of ψun are reversed. The plane wave, however, is not changed since its propagation

is in the y-direction alone; this implies the sense in which the crossing is broken by the

plane wave is opposite to that of the corresponding crossing at z = 0; the sense of crossing

breakings alternates as z increases. The full set of nodal lines, shown in ﬁgure 4, includes

the braid, shown in black; there are other nodal lines, shown in grey, which have broken

away from the conﬁguration of ﬁgure 2, and do not take part in the braiding.

The braid described here is structurally stable; if the numerical values of the parameters

in (5) are changed slightly, the braid remains topologically unchanged, although past certain

critical values of kz, d, and ε, it will be dissolved through various reconnection events, as

with nodal knots [9]. Structural stability means that parameters such as d and kz need not

be precisely controlled in an experimental or numerical realisation.

FIG. 4: Perturbed braid conﬁguration, where the ﬁeld of ﬁgure 2 has been perturbed by the plane

wave 0.05i exp(

other nodal lines. As with ﬁgure 2, the distance between the two horizontal planes is one z-period

−

2π/kz.

FIG. 5: Phase pattern of the full braid ﬁeld ψbraid in the plane z = 0. The ﬁgure-8 x, y trajectory

of the braiding singularities is included. The singularities depicted as grey in ﬁgure 4) do not cross

the z = 0 plane, and so are not seen here.

8

The key feature of the braid realisation is that the trajectory of the strands of a borromean

braid is topologically a ﬁgure-8, which has been achieved by wave dislocations in superposed

oﬀ-axis counterrotating beams. The parameters d and kz were chosen in (5) so that the

perturbing plane wave would have opposite phases at the two reconnection points with

z = 0; the reconnections were separated by 3π. However, this argument works for any

separation π(n + 1/2), for n = 1, 2, . . . , for which the values of d and kz in (5) should be

replaced by

d = π(n + 1/2)/√3;

kz = (1

3j2/π2(2n + 1)2)1/2.

(8)

−

In (5), n = 1 (if n = 0, then k2

z < 0, and the wave is not periodic in z). In this case, ε can
be arbitrary but small; the braid structure is more sensitive to the size of perturbation for

higher n. ψbraid can straightforwardly be generalised to give other m-stranded braids whose

transverse trajectory is a ﬁgure-8, by using Bessel beams of odd order m > 3, as follows. In

the unperturbed situation, with 3 replaced by m, there is a series of m zero points in the

z = 0 plane on the x = 0 line; kz and d are chosen such that the two furthest from the origin

are at y =

π(n + 1/2), and that the x-derivative vanishes there also. If m is even, the

±

extremal y zeros must be separated by an integer number of wavelengths, and the perturbed

pattern, instead of giving a braid, gives a pair of m/2-stranded helices. The construction

cannot be generalized in any obvious way to give other, more general braids.

Bessel beams and plane waves are often used in optics, but it is not entirely clear what

sort of quantum wave would correspond to (4). Would it therefore be possible to create a

close enough approximation to ψbraid in an optical experiment? This leads to the following

observations. Electromagnetic waves are of course vector ﬁelds, and, in general, phase

singularities do not occur in vector waves, especially in the nonparaxial regime [20]; nodes

generically only occur in scalar components of the wave. In the present case, if all three wave

beams in (4) are linearly polarized in the x-direction, which is possible since the separate

wave beams are propagating in the

z- and y-directions only, the braided nodal lines appear

±

in the x-component of the total ﬁeld (there will also be a longitudinal z-component arising

from the Bessel beams). A more serious problem in optical realization is the departure from

paraxiality; not only in the interference of coherent counterpropagating beams, but in the
fact that in the Bessel beams kz ≈
Moreover, the braid period is on the scale of the beam period itself, which is extremely small

0.8, meaning that the divergence of the beam is large.

at optical frequencies - unlike the knotted singularity construction of Ref. [8], the absolute

9

scale of the braid structure is ﬁxed. However, it is possible that use of a higher n as in

(8) may lead to a more experimentally realistic beam. It may be possible to use ﬁelds in a

diﬀerent part of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as radio waves, for which Bessel beams

can be synthesized and studied [21].

The present work shows how potentially realizable beams may be superposed to form

a ﬁeld containing structurally stable, braided nodal lines. However, this realization of a

braid is not necessarily the only possible one in interfering waves. For instance, it would

be interesting to investigate whether periodic braiding structure is possible in the space

above a two dimensional grating. Such a structure would have the desired z-periodicity,

although it does not have the counterpropagating waves used here. Braids, like knots, are

particular cases of a wide range of topologically interesting phenomena that may occur in

three dimensional wave ﬁelds, and one may ask whether other nodal conﬁgurations, such as

chains, are possible in beam superpositions. The existence of braided nodal lines widens the

topological possibilities of singular optics and quantum vortices, and provides a technical

challenge for experiment.

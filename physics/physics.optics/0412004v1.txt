Abstract

We show that the Einstein covariance principle provides an
opportunity to generate inﬁnitely many solutions of given co-
variant equation from a known one. With use of this statement
we derive exact expressions for charge and current densities in
a medium in an arbitrary external ﬁeld. We obtain that in a
homogeneous nondisipersive medium the ﬁeld of a point parti-
cle diﬀers at short-distances from the well known expression. We
also demonstrate that in a linear medium second harmonic gener-
ation and optical detection become possible in the ﬁeld of radially
polarized radiation..

Key words General relativity, covariance principle, charge

and current densities.

Introduction

The requirement of general covariance of the equations describing dif-
ferent processes in the nature is one of the corner-stones of Einstein
general relativity [1] and has enormous signiﬁcance in modern theoreti-
cal physics. When combined with the equivalence principle it reduces the
gravitation to the metric properties of space-time and shows intercon-
nection between the geometry of space-time continuum and the material
processes.

In this article we make an attempt to discover another powerful as-
pect of the Einstein covariance principle. Namely, we are going to show
that, the covariance principle provides new methods (algorithms) for
solution of diﬀerent problems of theoretical and mathematical physics.

1

In Sec.2 we show that with use of the covariance principle it is possible
to generate inﬁnitely many solutions of given covariant equation from
a known one. The new, generated, solutions correspond to physical
situations diﬀering (in boundary conditions, external ﬁelds) from those
in the known solution. For instance, having a free solution of the given
covariant equation, we can generate solutions of the same equation in
the external ﬁeld.

We succeeded in Sec.3 to perform this procedure for the continuity
equation for an ensemble of charged point particles and in Sec.4 for a
continuous medium using the Euler transformation i.e. with the help
of Euler transformation we can pick up the solutions of the continuity
equation in the external ﬁeld from the inﬁnite set of the new solutions
of continuity equation.

As a result, in Sec.4 we obtain exact expressions for the charge and
current densities in a medium in the presence of an arbitrary external
ﬁeld. These formulae contain the external ﬁeld in implicit way via Euler
displacement ﬁeld, which provides an opportunity to deﬁne polarization
of the medium in natural way independent of the kind of the medium.
Then, we show that in the case of homogeneous isotropic media it is
possible to unambiguously determine the polarization and magnetization
vectors in terms of the medium polarization.

In the Secs.5 and 6 we discuss some physical consequences of the
results of Sec.4 considering two ”textbook” problems of the linear elec-
trodynamics.

In Sec.5 we solve the problem of the ﬁeld of a charged point particle
in a homogeneous dielectric medium and ﬁnd out that in this case the
electric ﬁeld is determined by a cubic algebraic equation. Analyzing
solutions of this equation we detain a deviation from, the well known
result for small distances from the point charge.

In Sec.6 we consider propagation of radially polarized radiation in a
homogeneous linear dielectric medium. Our calculations show that in
this case (linear medium) it is possible to observe nonlinear phenomena
like optical detection and second harmonic generation.
Sec.7 concludes the paper with some remarks.

2 The main statement

The Einstein covariance principle [1] claims that any physical law must
have a covariant form i.e. if physical quantities A, B, ...according to some
physical law, are related by an equation

F

A (X) , ˆL [B (X)] , ...
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

= 0,

(1.a)

2

in coordinates X ( ˆL is an operator, diﬀerential, integral, etc.), the
functional relation should be the same in any other coordinates X ′i.e.

F

A′ (X ′) , ˆL′ [B′ (X ′)] , ...
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

= 0.

(1.b)

But, each physical quantity has certain transformation property (scalar,

vector, tensor etc.), i.e., for a given coordinate transformation

X ′i = W i (X) , (i = 0, 1, 2, 3)

(2)

these quantities are transformed as

A (X) = ˆΛ (X) A′ (W (X)) , B (X) = ˆΛ (X) B′ (W (X)) , ...

(3)

where ˆΛ = 1 for scalar quantities, for the vectors ˆΛ is a matrix (see.(8))
, for higher rank tensors ˆΛ is a direct product of matrices. Insertion of
(3) into (1.a) gives the equation

F

ˆΛ (X) A′ (W (X)) , ˆL
(cid:16)

ˆΛ (X) B′ (W (X))
h

i

(cid:17)

, ...

= 0,

(4)

which, by comparing with (1.b), leads to the following statement:

If A (X) , B (X) , ... satisfy the covariant equation

F

A (X) , ˆL [B (X)] , ...
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

= 0,

then

ˆΛ (X) A (W (X)) , ˆΛ (X) B (W (X)) , ...
satisfy the same equation for any W i (X) (i = 0, 1, 2, 3) .

(5.a)

(5.b)

Thus, Einstein covariance principle provides an opportunity to gen-
erate inﬁnite many new solutions for a given covariant equation from
a known one by means of transformations within the frames of general
relativity. The kind of covariant equation is not important for this state-
ment: the equation may be linear or non-linear, diﬀerential or integro-
diﬀerential, etc..

As we see, u(r,t) is a ﬁeld which equals, on the trajectories of parti-
cles, to the displacement of these trajectories caused by external forces
and, hence, it has the similar meaning as in the theory of elasticity [3].
On the other hand, the expression (13) is a special case of (10) when
W i (X) is the Euler transformation (12) with the additional condition
(14). Hence, we can say that, by using the covariance principle, we
are able to connect current and charge densities of disturbed and undis-
turbed system of an ensemble of point particles in any external ﬁeld with
the help of the Euler transformation. This suggestion is rather general.
In Sec.4 we will come to the same conclusion for the four-current in a
medium without referring to point structure of the particles in medium.

4 Charge and current densities in a medium

The expression (10) for the current provides an opportunity to reformu-
late unambiguously the electrodynamics of continuous media indepen-
dently of a speciﬁc type of the medium. Realistic media are complex
systems with a number of subsystems (free electrons, electrons of diﬀer-
ent atoms in the same atomic state, nuclei, etc.). In the macroscopic
electrodynamics, after Lorentz averaging, a medium is considered as
continuous substance consisting of diﬀerent continuous subsystems. De-
formations in media caused by external forces appear in this approach
as a consequence of modiﬁcations in particle trajectories caused by the
interaction of those with the external ﬁelds. This means that we can use
the methods of the description of the theory of elasticity [3] in the elec-
trodynamics of continuous media. So, the problem of determination of
the four-current of a certain subsystem in an external ﬁeld reduces to the
problem of determination of the four-current in the deformed subsystem
of the medium. The coordinates of deformed and undeformed subsys-
tems are connected by Euler transformation in terms of the displacement
ﬁeld u(r,t) [3]

W i (X) = (ct, r

u (r, t))

(15)

−

5

and, hence, the expression (13) which is (10) written for Euler transfor-
mation (15) gives the four-current ji of the subsystem in the external
ﬁeld as a linear combination of the same quantity ji
0 for the undisturbed
subsystem. By using (A.5) of Appendix we obtain the three-dimensional
form of the current (13):

where
αβ are given by expression (A.4), (A.6) of Appendix. The
expression (16) is exact for any displacement ﬁeld. Now, summing the
expressions (16) over all subsystems (each with its own displacement
ﬁelds) we arrive at the exact formulas for the charge and current densities
of the medium in any external ﬁeld.

Consider a medium consisting of a subsystem of identical particles
and a background which ensures neutrality of the medium.. Let the
particle distribution in equilibrium be homogeneous and isotropic, then
for averaged charge and current densities we have ¯ρ0 = const, ¯j0 ≡
0.
Deﬁning the polarization of the medium as P (r,t) = ρ0u (r,t), which is
induced dipole moment density of the particles, and taking into account
the neutrality condition, we obtain from (16), (A.4), (A.6) the following
expressions for the charge and current densities of the medium in the
external ﬁeld

In what follows we will restrict ourselves to consideration of linear

4π E.This is a restriction on the value of external
electromagnetic ﬁeld, but it could have large spatial derivatives which
we cannot neglect in this approximation. Hence, even in linear regime
of the interaction expressions (18) remain nonlinear.

5 The ﬁeld of a point charge in a medium

Consider the electrostatic ﬁeld of the point particle with charge q lo-
cated at the origin of the coordinates in a medium. Because of spherical
symmetry and stationarity of the problem, for the only nonzero compo-
nent of (18) we have

As we see, screening depends on relative sign of ρ0 and q. For the
same signs of ρ0 and q the eﬀective charge is larger than q/ε, and for
diﬀerent signs it is smaller. This fact has a simple geometrical explana-
tion. According to the Gauss theorem, the ﬁeld of the point particle at
the point r is proportional to the charge within the sphere of the radius
r. In case of the same signs of ρ0 and q medium particles between the
and r leave the sphere r. For the case of the diﬀerent
spheres r
signs of ρ0 and q medium particles come into the sphere r from between
those of radii r and r +
. But in these two cases the magnitude of out-
and incoming charges are not equal: in the second case the incoming is
greater, and we have the asymmetry mentioned above.

6 Nonlinear eﬀects in a linear medium

Let us consider now a problem with cylindrical symmetry, i.e., propaga-
tion of a radially polarized radiation E0 (r,z, t) = ˆırE (r) exp i (k0z
ω0t)
(for instance T EM01radially polarized mode [4]) in a linear, isotropic
medium. For the nonzero component of (18) ,i.e, radially polarized po-
larization P = ˆırPr(r, z, t) (r2 = x2 + y2) we have

7 Concluding remarks

We have shown how to generate with the help of Einstein covariance
principle inﬁnite many new solutions of a given covariant equation hav-
ing a known one. By using Euler transformation we have separated a
solution to the generated set of continuity equation which is a solution
to the same equation in an arbitrary external ﬁeld. In this way we got
an exact expression for the charge and current densities for a medium

8

in the external ﬁeld. This new approach gives us an opportunity to
determine the polarization of a homogeneous medium in a very general
manner, i. e., independently of the model of the medium. In addition, it
is possible, in this case, to unambiguously determine the electric polar-
ization and magnetization vectors in terms of the medium polarization
and its derivatives. Further on we considered applications of this expres-
sion. Solving the problem of charged point particle in a homogeneous
dielectric medium we arrived at a cubic algebraic equation for the elec-
tric ﬁeld, whose solution shows deviation of the electric ﬁeld from the
classical result at small distances from the point charge. We predicted
second harmonic generation and optical detection phenomena in a linear
medium.

It would be interesting to apply this approach to other equations in
mathematical physics. These type of investigations are in progress and
will be published elsewhere.

We note ﬁnally that the boundary-value problem of the electrody-
namics of an expanding-contracting sphere has been for the ﬁrst time
solved in [5] with use of the covariance principle, but the authors did not
realized, at that time, the universality and importance of that approach.

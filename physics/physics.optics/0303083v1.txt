We observe the formation of an intense optical wavepacket fully localized in all dimensions, i.e.
both longitudinally (in time) and in the transverse plane, with an extension of a few tens of fsec and
microns, respectively. Our measurements show that the self-trapped wave is a X-shaped light bullet
spontaneously generated from a standard laser wavepacket via the nonlinear material response (i.e.,
second-harmonic generation), which extend the soliton concept to a new realm, where the main
hump coexists with conical tails which reﬂect the symmetry of linear dispersion relationship.

Defeating the natural spreading of a wavepacket (WP)
is a universal and challenging task in any physical context
involving wave propagation. Ideal particle-like behavior
of WPs is demanded in applications, such as microscopy,
laser-induced particle acceleration, ultra-
tomography,
sound medical diagnostics, Bose-Einstein condensation,
volume optical-data storage, optical interconnects, and
those encompassing long-distance or high-resolution sig-
nal transmission. The quest for light WPs that are both
invariant (upon propagation) and suﬃcently localized in
all dimensions (3D, i.e., both transversally and longitu-
dinally or in time) against spreading ”forces” exerted by
diﬀraction and material group-velocity dispersion (GVD,
k′′ = d2k/dω2|ω0 ) has motivated long-standing stud-
ies, which have followed diﬀerent strategies in the linear
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and nonlinear [6, 7] regime, respectively.
In the linear case, to counteract material (intrinsic)
GVD, one can exploit the angular dispersion (i.e., de-
pendence of propagation angle on frequency) that stems
from a proper WP shape. The prototype of such WPs is
the X-wave [2], a non-monochromatic, yet non-dispersive,
superposition of non-diﬀracting cylindrically symmetric
Bessel J0 (so-called conical or Durnin [1]) beams, ex-
perimentally tested in acoustics [3], optics [4] and mi-
crowave antennae [5]. Importantly, in the relevant case of
WPs with relatively narrow spectral content both tempo-
rally (around carrier frequency ω0) and spatially (around
propagation direction z, i.e. paraxial WPs), X-waves
require normally dispersive media (k′′ > 0).
In this
case, a WP with disturbance E(r, t, z) exp(ik0z − iω0T )
(k0 ≡ k(ω0), r2 ≡ x2 + y2), has a slowly-varying envelope
E = E(r, t, z) obeying the standard wave equation

k′′Ω2/2 − K 2/(2k0) = β, which follows from Eq. (1) in

these curves, displayed in Fig. 1(a), reﬂect the hyper-
bolic nature of the wave equation (1) and show the com-
mon asymptotic spectral X-shape associated with the
lines K = ±2k0k′′Ω (β = 0). When the spectral com-
ponents lying along such X are superimposed coherently

(in phase), the ﬁeld in the physical space (r, t) also re-
tains a propagation invariant X-shape, as entailed e.g.
by the exact solution E = Re{[(∆ − it)2 + k0k′′r2]−1/2}
of Eq. (1) shown in Fig. 1(b-c). Here ∆ represents dura-
tion of the X-wave central hump. Main features of these
waves are the conical (clepsydra) 3D structure and the
slow spatial decay (1/r characteristic of J0 components
[1]), displayed by Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively.

Conversely, in the nonlinear (high intensity) regime,
non-spreading WPs exploit the idea that, in self-focusing
media, the nonlinear wavefront curvature can simulta-
neously balance the curvature due to diﬀraction and
to GVD, combining features of spatial [9] and tempo-
ral [10] solitons to form a bell-shaped 3D-localized WP
E(r, t), so-called light-bullet [6]. In sharp contrast with
X-waves, such compensation strictly requires anomalous
GVD (k′′ < 0) [6], thus implying that along the WP tails,
where Eq. (1) still holds true, space r and time t play the
same role giving rise to strong WP localization [13]. Sta-
ble trapping, however, has been observed only in setting
of reduced dimensionality (2D) [7, 8], including also other
contexts, e.g. spin [11] or atomic waves [12] (3D kinetic
energy and atom-atom attractive interactions act exactly
as diﬀraction-GVD and self-focusing, respectively) where
similar trapping mechanisms hold true.

In this work, we outclass the two approaches by demon-
strating that space-time localization in the normal GVD
regime becomes accessible in the nonlinear regime. Trap-
ping is accomplished by mutual balance of intrinsic,
shape-induced, and nonlinear contributions in a new type
of WP, namely a nonlinear X-wave, which permits to get
over two limitations at once. First, in contrast with lin-
ear X-waves, whose observation requires non-trivial input
beam shaping [3, 4], our experiment reveals a remark-
able ”mode-locking” process that, starting from a con-
ventional (gaussian) laser WP, spontaneously performs
the reshaping into a localized X-shaped WP. Second, we
believe this to be the ﬁrst genuine nonlinear trapping in
full-dimensional 3D physical space, since to date mate-
rial and/or instability limitations [6, 7] have rendered the
observation of light 3D bullets elusive.

Figure 2 describes the strong localization features ob-
served after propagation in a 22 mm long sample of
lithium triborate (LBO) χ(2) crystal. At the input
we launch a laser WP at fundamental frequency (FF)
ω0 = 2πc/λ0, λ0 = 1060 nm, with gaussian proﬁle in
both t (with FWHM duration in the 100 − 200 fs range )
and r (45 µm FWHM at waist, located few mm before the
crystal so that the input beam is slightly diverging). The
LBO crystal is tuned for generation of optical second-
harmonic (SH) in the regime of relatively large positive
phase mismatch ∆k = 2k(ω0) − k(2ω0) = 30 cm−1 or
eﬀective self-focusing for the FF beam [15]. When the
input energy exceeds about 0.25 µJ, mutually trapped
localized WPs at FF and SH are observed (see Fig. 2).
Time-integrated measurements of spatial proﬁles (Fig. 2,
top) indicate that diﬀraction is fully defeated to yield
a spatial soliton-like beam [9], while temporal autocor-

relations reveal a single pulse which is strongly com-
pressed (down to ∼ 20 fs, see Fig. 2, bottom). Re-
markably nonlinear mixing balances the two highest-
order dispersive eﬀects, namely the tendency of FF and
SH to walk-oﬀ due to group-velocity mismatch (GVM)
δV = k′(2ω0) − k′(ω0) and GVD, which act in the linear
regime over characteristic length scales 50 and 2.5 times
shorter than the crystal length, respectively. Relying on
nonlinear scenarios known to date, the present result is
unexpected.
In fact, the normal GVD and the strong
GVM of LBO do not allow an explanation in terms of
light bullets, whereas the dynamics of self-focusing with
normal GVD is dominated by pulse splitting without en-
visaging localization whatsoever [14].

In order to get a deeper understanding, we performed
a set of numerical experiments by integrating the well-
known model [15], which generalizes Eq. (1) to nonlinear
coupling of envelopes Em(r, t, z) (m = 1, 2, carrier mω0)

In Fig. 3 (top) we show snapshots of the space-time evo-
lution. It is clear that, in the ﬁrst stage (z = 10−15 mm),
the generation of light at SH is accompanied by strong
self-focusing, in turn inducing pulse compression (in spite
of the normal GVD that would cause temporal broaden-
ing of plane-waves). The WP becomes asymmetric since
self-focusing is stronger where the SH, which lags behind
because of GVM, tends to be. More importantly, during
this process the WP undergoes a strong reshaping, where
a large fraction of energy is radiated oﬀ-axis to form the
tails of a conical wave (see snapshot at z = 20 mm). Af-
ter this stage, however, the collapse stops and the WP

propagates (locked with the SH) with immutable shape
and nearly constant energy, duration, and size.

By changing the parameters in Eqs. (2) we can con-
clude that: (i) nonlinearity is the key element that drives
the reshaping and holds the WP together.
In fact, by
switching it oﬀ after the transient (i.e., χ = 0 for z > 20
mm), the WP exhibits strong diﬀraction and extremely
fast FF-SH walk-oﬀ. The reshaped WP can by no means
be considered a linear X-wave; (ii) in our crystal, GVM
is the dominant dispersion term aﬀecting the asymptotic
duration and width of the localized WP (both decrease
for smaller GVM). However, (symmetric) X-shaped WPs
are formed also in the ideal case of vanishing GVM,
provided that GVD is normal; (iii) the WP reshaping
strongly aﬀects the phase modulation process, which re-
veals the contribution of an eﬀective anomalous GVD;
(iv) by including additional cubic nonlinearities [15], the
phenomenon remains qualitatively unchanged.

A more rigorous ground for explaining the dramatic
reshaping shown in Fig. 3 is oﬀered by the investiga-
tion of two diﬀerent aspects, both implicitly accounted
for by Eqs. (2):
(i) the stability of continuous plane-
waves; (ii) the existence of nonlinear X-shaped eigen-
solutions. Though somewhat idealized, the results of
this analysis allow gathering the two basic features of
the spatio-temporal dynamics, namely the transient re-
shaping of the input gaussian-like WP followed by the
quasi-stationary regime.

The linear stability analysis of z-invariant solutions of
Eqs. (2) with ideally vanishing spatio-temporal spectral
width (i.e., continuous plane waves) always reveal the
presence of exponentially growing weak (up to noise level)
perturbations with deﬁnite frequency K, Ω. However,
the instability features reﬂect the symmetry of the linear
wave equation, thus being qualitatively diﬀerent in the
normal and anomalous GVD regime, respectively. While
anomalous GVD leads to narrow bandwidth features as
in conventional spatial or temporal modulational insta-
bility [15], the hyperbolic structure of the diﬀraction-
dispersion operator in the normal GVD regime of our
experiment leads to exponential ampliﬁcation of conical
wave perturbations (Bessel J0 beams) with frequencies
basically approaching the asymptotes of Fig. 1(a) [16].
When growing spontaneously from noise, the ampliﬁed
components in the virtual inﬁnite bandwidth (in real-
ity limited by non-paraxiality and higher-order dispersion
not accounted for in Eqs. (1-2)) leads to colored conical
emission. Our calculations show that the phenomenon
persists under dynamical conditions (unseeded SH gen-
eration) and when pumped by short-pulse narrow-beam
inputs, as in our experiment. In the latter case, the am-
pliﬁcation of proper frequency components of the WP
preserves the mutual phase coherence, thus acting as a
trigger which drives the transformation of the WP into

derlying linear system in amplifying those components
which allow both diﬀraction and dispersion of the whole

indeed,

A second, strong argument in favour of the nearly
asymptotic character of the evolution shown in Figs. 3,
is the existence of stationary localized solutions of
that
Eqs. (2). We have recently shown,
the natural propagation-invariant [i.e., with dependence
Em(r, t) exp(imβz), m = 1, 2] localized eigensolutions of
SH generation process in the normal GVD regime (either
with or without GVM) are indeed nonlinear X waves [17].
These waves are similar to those shown in Fig. 1(b-c)
except for the fact that their peak intensity is related
to their duration and width through the nonlinearity.
Since the measurements in Fig. 2 give information only
about the WP central hump, in order to conﬁrm experi-
mentally that the observed strong focusing and compres-
sion dynamics is indeed driven by the formation of an
X-wave, we have performed diﬀerent additional measure-
ments. First, we have characterised the propagation of
the WP in air after the LBO nonlinear crystal. We ob-
serve that the beam diﬀracts less than a gaussian beam
of the same width (the divergence angle is 2.5 times less),
and this net sub-gaussian diﬀraction witnesses a Bessel-
like feature of the WP. Moreover, temporal broadening
to 150 fs after only 10 cm of propagation in air is an indi-
cation that the WP develops strong angular dispersion.
Both observations are in good quantitative agreement

with data obtained numerically from Eqs. (2). However,
it is only the tomography of the output WP, i.e. map-
ping the WP intensity in space and time, that can give
direct unequivocal evidence for the formation of an X-
wave. To this end we have developed a new technique
based on an ultrafast nonlinear gating, or a scanning
cross-correlation technique, realized by frequency mixing
the WP under investigation with a 20 fs, high contrast,
steep front, probe pulse in the visible, which is uniform
over a large (few mm2) area (the details of the set up
will be presented elsewhere). Thanks to the high quality
of the probe and the use of a very thin (20 µm) BBO
mixing crystal, the apparatus has high temporal resolu-
tion. The intensity map of the output WP is reported
in Fig. 4(a). The insets also show the measured beam
proﬁle in the transverse plane at time t = 0 (peak) and
t = 70 fs (far from peak), respectively. The measured
proﬁle clearly shows the features of an X-wave with a

conical structure, which emanates from a strongly local-
ized central spatio-temporal hump. Unlike conventional
pulse splitting [14], here splitting occurs only suﬃciently
oﬀ-axis (x ∼ 100µm) in the WP low-intensity portion.
For comparison we also report in Fig. 4(b) the proﬁle
calculated from Eqs. (2) under the same conditions, the
agreement being excellent. The fringe-like structure that
appears for large delays in both Fig. 4(a) and (b) is due
to 5 mm of free-space propagation in air outside the crys-
tal. Although the calculated proﬁle on the output face
of the crystal indeed shows that such fringes disappear
[see Fig. 4(c)], measurement with perfect imaging on the
output LBO face reveals saturation of the mixing process
due to a too intense peak.

In summary, we have reported the ﬁrst evidence that
the natural 3D (temporal and spatial) spreading of a fo-
cused ultrashort wavepacket can be balanced in trans-
parent materials at high intensity. The underlying mech-
anism is the spontaneous formation of a X-wave charac-
terized by an intense (i.e., nonlinear) central hump self-
trapped through mutual balance with (essentially linear)
dispersive contributions associated with coexisting slowly
decaying conical tails. While our experiment is carried
out by exploiting self-focusing nonlinearities arising from
quadratic nonlinearity, we envisage the general role that
self-trapping mediated by nonlinear X-waves can have for
a wide class of materials and applications encompassing
centrosymmetric optical (Kerr) media [6], Bose-Einstein
condensation [12], and acoustics [3].

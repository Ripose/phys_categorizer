Abstract

Use of non one-dimensional distributed feedback in VFEL gives possibility of fre-
quency tuning in wide range. In present work dependence of lasing process on the
angle between resonant diﬀraction grating grooves and direction of electron beam
velocity is discussed.

1 Introduction

New advances in diﬀerent areas require the development of tunable, wide-
band, high-power sources of coherent electromagnetic radiation in GigaHertz,
TeraHertz and higher frequency ranges. Conventional electron vacuum devices
have restricted possibility of frequency tuning (usually it does not exceed 5-
10%) for the certain carrier frequency at certain e-beam energy. Volume free
electron laser (VFEL)[3,4] was proposed as a new type of free electron laser.
Frequency tuning, possibility of use of wide electron beams (several e-beams)
and reduction of threshold current density necessary for start of generation,

provided by VFEL, make it a basis for development of more compact, high-
power and tunable radiation sources then conventional electron vacuum de-
vices could let.

First lasing of VFEL was reported at FEL 2001 [4].

generation zone. Starting current j depends on interaction length L as [2]:
jstart ∼ 1/{(kL)3(kχτ L)2s}, s is the number of surplus waves appearing due
to diﬀraction (for example, in case of two-wave Bragg diﬀraction s = 1, for
three-wave diﬀraction s = 2 and so on).

3. Wide electron beams and diﬀraction gratings of large volumes can be used
in VFEL. Two or three-dimensional diﬀraction gratings allow to distribute
interaction over large volume and to overcome power restrictions in resonator.
Volume distributed feedback provides mode discrimination in VFEL resonator.

4. VFEL can simultaneously generate radiation at several frequencies that is
extremely important, for example, for development of multifrequency radiation
source.

3 Experimental setup

VFEL operates in wavelength range ∼4 mm at electron beam energy up to
10keV. Such generating device is very interesting for practical use in sub-
millimeter (TeraHertz) range, which is actively employing for medical exam-
ination. VFEL resonator is formed by two parallel diﬀraction gratings with
diﬀerent periods and two smooth sidewalls (see ﬁgure in [4]). The interaction of
the exciting diﬀraction grating with an electron beam arouses Smith-Purcell
radiation. The resonant diﬀraction grating provides distributed feedback of
generated radiation with electron beam by Bragg dynamical diﬀraction. Res-
onant grating can rotate to change orientation of grating grooves with respect
to electron beam velocity that provides tuning of diﬀraction conditions. 1

1 Undoubtedly, fast frequency modulation of VFEL radiation can be done by rota-
tion of electron beam (for example, by the use of drift in crossed ﬁelds) with respect
to diﬀraction grating grooves. Also frequency tuning can be provided by azimuth
rotation of annular electron beam in resonator formed by two cylindrical diﬀraction
gratings with helix grooves.

The length of resonator is 100 mm, periods of the exciting diﬀraction grating
and resonant diﬀraction grating are 0.67 mm and 3 mm, respectively. The rib-
bon electron beam with proﬁle 10 mm x 1 mm is emitted by thermal cathode,
formed in Pierce gun without beam compression and guided through resonator
along dﬀraction gratings. Only electrons passing at the distance h ≤ λβγ/(4π)
[6] near the exciting grating surface interact with electromagnetic wave eﬀec-
tively (i.e. less than 10% of total cross size of electron beam participates in
lasing process). To provide the most eﬀective interaction of electron beam with
the exciting grating, it is placed in a beam and the value of “grating current”
(i.e. part of total electron beam current falling to the grating) is monitored
as a touchstone of interaction eﬃciency and indicator of beam position with
respect to grating surface. The following parameters can be monitored during
experiment: beam voltage (electron beam energy); total electron beam cur-
rent (number of emitted electrons per second); ”grating current”; angle be-
tween resonant grating grooves and electron beam velocity (angle of grating
rotation); distance between gratings (transverse size of resonator); microwave
power and frequency. Electrons are emitted in pulsed regime (unipolar pulse
with sinusoidal shape and pulse duration 10 ms) in sequence of two or three
voltage pulses. Voltage can vary from 0 to 10 kV (hence, electron beam en-
ergy is varied from 0 to 10 keV). Diﬀerent longitudional modes of resonator are
excited while electron energy passes through the whole variation interval. Fre-
quency of data reading is determined by the condition that change of electron
energy between two consecutive measurements of each monitored parameter
should not cause change of generation regime. Estimated admissible change
of energy is about ∼1% of rating value. Data reading interval is 4 · 10−5 s.

A lot of system parameters can be varied during experiment, so complete in-
vestigation of the system requires multiple measurements. Experimental study
of frequency tuning and change of radiation intensity at mechanical rotation
of resonant diﬀraction grating (i.e. at variation of the angular orientation of
grooves of resonant diﬀraction grating with respect to electron beam velocity)
is presented in this paper.

4 Theoretical background

General theoretical statements [1,3] should be reminded for better understand-
ing of the below experimental results. Considering processes in resonator one
should discern the diﬀerence between two cases: (a) presence of resonator
sidewalls can be neglected; (b) presence of sidewalls of resonator can not be
neglected. For unbounded waveguide (case (a)) two geometries of diﬀraction
are distinguished: those of Bragg and Laue [5]. Laue geometry of diﬀraction
implies that both incident and diﬀracted waves passes to vacuum through the
same boundary of resonator, while at Bragg diﬀraction incident and diﬀracted

4

waves passes through the diﬀerent boundaries. Absolute instability can appear
in Bragg geometry and such system works as generator (for backward Bragg
diﬀraction it converts into a well-known backward-wave tube). For Laue case
convective instability provides only ampliﬁcation regime.

Generation process in resonator is described by Maxwell equations, containing

Presence of sidewalls imparts new feature to diﬀraction process in resonator,
because even in Laue-like case (which corresponds to Laue geometry of diﬀrac-
tion if neglecting the sidewalls) the matrix element χef f (z) diﬀers from zero.
And, as a result, generation regime can be reached at Laue-like geometry, in
contrast with an unbounded waveguide, where Laue geometry provides only
ampliﬁcation regime, while generation is possible at Bragg diﬀraction.

Now let us consider behavior of lasing eﬃciency with grating rotation. Ro-
tation of diﬀraction grating changes components of reciprocal lattice vector.
From (1) it is easy to see that χef f (z) decreases with τy growth. Change of
χef f (z) yields change of generation conditions and, in particular, generation
threshold. Reduction of χef f (z) results in decrease of generation eﬃciency
(Fig.8). But, interaction eﬃciency can be increased if recollect that at certain
value of current density the intensity is proportional to the term e− 4π

Non-one-dimensional feedback, being used in VFEL, provides tuning of radi-
ation frequency by diﬀraction grating rotation. Measured frequencies at rota-
tion of resonant diﬀraction grating for microwave peak, corresponding electron

6 Conclusion

VFEL generator can be considered as a new type of tunable backward wave
tube with variable period (due to gratings rotation) and VFEL ampliﬁer is a
new type of tunable travelling wave tube.

Frequency tuning, possibility of use of wide electron beams (several e-beams)
and reduction of threshold current density necessary for start of generation,
provided by VFEL, make it a basis for development of more compact, high-
power and tunable radiation sources then conventional electron vacuum de-
vices could let.

New VFELs with electron beam energy up to 30keV and 500keV have been
developing for next set of experiments.

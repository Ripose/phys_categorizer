Abstract

Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions occur when a physical system is excited with a single

or several frequencies and when the relationship between the input and output is non-linear.

Working with non-linearities in the Frequency domain is not straightforward specially when the

relationship between the input and output is not trivial. We outline the complete derivation of

the Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions from basic principles to a general physical system.

For illustration, the procedure is applied to the Single Mode laser diode where the relationship of

input to output is non-trivial. The distortions terms are extracted directly from the Laser Diode

rate equations and the method is tested by comparison to many results cited in the literature.

This methodology is general enough to be applied to the extraction of distortion terms to any

desired order in many physical systems in a general and systematic way.

INTRODUCTION

Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions occur when a signal at a single frequency

or a superposition of several signals with diﬀerent frequencies propagate in a non-linear

physical system. Historically it was ﬁrst highlighted in the Radar and Radio Communi-

cations industry because of the interest in understanding interference from other radars,

jammers, other transmitters or modulators... Presently,

it is pervading High Energy

Physics particle detectors, wideband ampliﬁers, satellite communications [1] and other

areas of science and technology. To cite some of the areas of interest, it occurs in many

types of devices such as Mechanical [2], Acoustical (Microphones for instance), Electronic

[3] and Microelectronic [4], Microwave [5], Optical [6], Magnetic [7] and Superconducting [8].

Parasitic frequency terms appear either at integer multiple of the base frequency

(harmonic) or as a mixture of two or several multiples of base frequencies (intermodulation)

when several base frequencies are used (as in modulation systems for instance). These

terms can be either post-ﬁltered or the signal can be pre-distorted in order to avoid the

appearance of these unwanted terms.

In this work, we introduce a general and systematic method to evaluate these terms from

the equations of motion describing the physical system at hand (Laser diode rate equations).

This case is chosen to highlight the case when the relationship between input and output is

non-trivial. This paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we outline the general procedure

for expressing the output from the input and deﬁne the various distortion terms. In section

3 we apply the procedure in detail to the Single Mode Laser diode order by order up to third

and conclude in section 4. The Appendix contains the full expressions of all terms derived

in section 3.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURE

The Single Mode (SM) laser diode rate equations are written as:

dN

τn

=

− g(N − Nt)(1 − ǫS)S

(1)

dS
dt

τn

−

S
τph

+ Γg(N − Nt)(1 − ǫS)S

(2)

N represents the electron density ( Nt at transparency) and S the photon density. τn

is the electron spontaneous lifetime and τph is the photon lifetime. β is the fraction of

spontaneous emission coupled into the lasing mode, Γ the optical conﬁnement factor, g is

the diﬀerential gain and ǫ is the gain compression parameter. q is the electron charge, V

the volume of the active region and I is the injection current.

a- Step 1 [Elimination of (N − Nt)]:

The input is the injection current I and the output is the light intensity represented by

S. Since other variable such as N, the electron density, intervene in the SM equations

we proceed to the elimination of that variable. When several modes are present (or other

intermediate variables) we proceed in an analogous manner by successive elimination until

we have a single equation relating input to output.

From (2) we extract the value of (N − Nt) as:

(N − Nt) =

dS

dt − ΓβNt
+ S

Γg(1 − ǫS)S + Γβ





(3)

This can be used to ﬁnd dN/dt and eliminate completely N from the coupled equations

(1) and (2). The result is:

b- Step 2 [Small signal expansion about a static operating point]:

The useful SM Laser diode regime with an injection current modulating the output light

intensity. In the small dynamic signal case, I = I0 + i and S = S0 + s, where I0 and S0 are

the static injection current and photon density respectively, whereas, i = i(t) and s = s(t),

are the signals of interest. We expand (4) [to n-th order]:

i = {A1s + B1s′ + C1s′′} + {A2s2 + B2ss′ + C2ss′′ + D2[s′]2}... + {Ansn

+Bnsn−1s′ + Cnsn−1s′′ + Dnsn−2[s′]2}

(5)

The expansion has this form because the ﬁrst time derivative is applied to a fraction
whose expansion contains n-order terms of the form sn−1s′ and sn. After the derivation we

3

obtain n-order terms of the form sn−1s′′, sn−2[s′]2 and sn−1s′. s′ and s′′ are ﬁrst and second
time derivatives of s. In addition we still have n-order terms of the generic sn and s′sn−1

forms coming from the expansion of the right hand side of (4). Hence the general n-order
term is Ansn + Bnsn−1s′ + Cnsn−1s′′ + Dnsn−2[s′]2 where all the parameters An, Bn, Cn, Dn

depend on the laser parameters. The appendix contains explicit expressions for some of

these coeﬃcients. The absence of a constant term means that no dynamic response i exists

when there is no dynamic light excitation [s= 0].

Incidentally, we have used for simplicity of illustration the SM standard equations that

contain two coupled population N (electron) and S (photon) equations in the form of two

ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations. The method is in fact valid for any number of

population equations as long as the elimination procedure of all intermediate variables (or

poulations) is possible, leaving us with a single equation relating i to s (Equation (5)) or

input to output.

The harmonic distortions and intermodulation distortions are calculated from the generalized

transfer functions denoted as Hn(ω1, ω2, ω3...). They are obtained from the Fourier transform

of the Volterra impulse response hn in the following way:

Hn(jω1, jω2, jω3...) =

...

hn(t1, t2, t3, ...)e−j(ω1t1+ω2t2+ω3t3...)dt1dt2dt3...

For instance, the n-th order distortion is given by:

III. ORDER BY ORDER DISTORTIONS

Starting from the two laser rate equations, Darcie et al. [6] derived formulae pertaining

to the second order, third order and intermodulation distortions for a channel excited by

a superposition of two signals with angular frequencies ω1 and ω2. The second and third

order distortions are calculated respectively at 2ω1 and 3ω1 whereas the intermodulation

distortions are evaluated at 2ω1 − ω2 and 2ω2 − ω1. From our formula (7), we can write

these distortions as [9, 10]:

a- Second order:

b- Third order:

c- Intermodulation:

M2(jω1, jω1) = 20 log10

|H2(jω1, jω1)|
2|H1(jω1)H1(jω1)| )

(

M3(jω1, jω1, jω1) = 20 log10

|H3(jω1, jω1, jω1)|
4|H1(jω1)H1(jω1)H1(jω1)| )

(

M3(jω1, jω1, −jω2) = 20 log10

|H3(jω1, jω1, −jω2)|
4|H1(jω1)H1(jω1)H1(−jω2)| )

,

(

M3(jω2, jω2, −jω1) = 20 log10

|H3(jω2, jω2, −jω1)|
4|H1(jω2)H1(jω2)H1(−jω1)| )

(

The HIM allows us to calculate the values of the various Hn’s for n=1, 2 and 3. As an

illustration of the procedure, we calculate H1 and H2 after performing steps 1 and 2 and

having obtained the expansion (5) to the speciﬁed order [9, 10]. First, we calculate H1 after

simply using i = exp(jωt) in (5) and:

s =

Gkexp[j(kω)t]

(14)

∞

Xk=0

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

The term G1 [with the identiﬁcation of the terms multiplying exp(jωt)] obeys the relation:

1 = [A1 + jωB1 − ω2C1]G1

where A1, B1 and C1 depend on the laser parameters. Using the HIM [see (9)] we can

write:

H1(jω) = G1 = 1/[A1 + jωB1 − ω2C1]

The modulus of H1(jω) equal to 1/

(A1 − ω2C1)2 + (ωB1)2 is what Darcie et al. [6] call

the small-signal frequency response R(ω). In order to calculate second order terms, we use

i(t) = exp(jω1t) + exp(jω2t) in equation (5) [truncated to second order] along with:

s =

Gklexp[j(kω1 + lω2)t]

(17)

q

∞

Xk,l=0

As stated in (9) the various Gkl are obtained from the following [9, 10]: G00 = 0., G10 =

H1(jω1), G01 = H1(jω2) and G11 = H2(jω1, jω2).

Identiﬁcation of the terms multiplying

exp(j[ω1 + ω2]t) yields:

0 = [A1 + j(ω1 + ω2)B1 − (ω1 + ω2)2C1]G11 + [A2G01G10 + A2G10G01 + jω1B2G01G10

+jω2B2G10G01 − ω2

1C2G01G10 − ω2

2C2G10G01 − ω1ω2D2G01G10 − ω1ω2D2G10G01]

(15)

(16)

(18)

With the use of (16) this can be written as:

H2(jω1, jω2) = G11 =

−[2A2 + j(ω1 + ω2)B2 − (ω2

1 + ω2

2)C2 − 2ω1ω2D2]H1(jω1)H1(jω2)H1(j[ω1 + ω2]) (19)

The second order distortions are obtained from (10) and (20) once the expressions of

A2, B2, C2, D2 are found from the direct expansion of (4). The Taylor expansion to the

third order is made in the Appendix allowing calculations of third order and intermodula-

tion distortions. Also, the values of the various coeﬃcients are given as functions of the laser

parameters.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we outline a general and systematic method to evaluate Harmonic and

Intermodulation distortions that occur when a signal at a single frequency or a superposition

6

of several signals with diﬀerent frequencies propagate in a non-linear physical system. The

method is generalisable to any order and pertains to cases where a non-trivial relationship

exists between input and output exists.

In the case of a SM Laser diode, we have a system of two coupled diﬀerential population

equations describing the system, nevertheless a general procedure has been described in

order to relate the input injection current to the output light intensity. The results obtained

in this paper agree with those published in the literature and the methodology highlighted

provides a self-contained framework to evaluate distortions in a systematic way.

Procedure:

In order to calculate the various An, Bn, Cn and Dn terms ( for n=1, 2, 3) a Taylor expansion
about S = S0 and s′ = 0 is to be made to third order of equation (4). The following term

should be expanded before taking its time derivative:

dS

dt − ΓβNt
+ S
τn
τph
Γg(1 − ǫS)S + Γβ
τn









We can simplify the expansion considerably using the following orders of magnitude valid
in most single-mode laser diodes: β ∼= 0(∼ 10−3 to 10−4), τn = ∞ , 1 − ǫS0 is practically 1

and gS0 ≪ 1/τph. The term becomes after these considerations:

The next term to be expanded to third order is:

dS

dt + S
τph
Γg(1 − ǫS)S 




[g(1 − ǫS)S +

dt − ΓβNt
+ S

Γg(1 − ǫS)S + Γβ

]









When we account for the aforementioned orders of magnitude it becomes:

dS

dt + S
τph
Γ









The third order expansion of (21) after taking the time derivative gives:

[ǫ/(τphΓg)]s′ + [1/(ΓgS0)]s′′ + [ǫ/(ΓgS0) − 1/(ΓgS2

0)]([s′]2 + ss′′)

+[ǫ2/(ΓgS0) − (3ǫS0 − 2ǫ2S2

0 − 1)/(ΓgS3

0)](s2s′′ + 2s[s′]2)

(24)

Adding the contributions from (23) [s′/Γ + s/(τphΓ)] and term by term identiﬁcation

gives for the various orders:

First order: A1s + B1s′ + C1s′′ where:

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(25)

A1 = 1/(τphΓ)

B1 = ǫ/(τphΓg) + 1/Γ

C1 = 1/(ΓgS0)

Second order: A2s2 + B2ss′ + C2ss′′ + D2[s′]2 with:

A2 = 0

B2 = 0

D2 = C2

C2 = [ǫ/(ΓgS0) − 1/(ΓgS2

0)]

Third order: A3s3 + B3s2s′ + C3s2s′′ + D3s[s′]2 with:

A3 = 0

B3 = 0

D3 = 2C3

The frequency response:

C3 = [ǫ2/(ΓgS0) − (3ǫS0 − 2ǫ2S2

0 − 1)/(ΓgS3

0)]

and the second harmonic distortion given by (10) and transformed with the help of (19):

M2(jω1, jω1) = 20 log10{2ω2

1|C2H1(2jω1)|}

agree with the results of Darcie et al [6].

In order to calculate third order and intermodulation eﬀects, we use eq. (5) truncated to

third order and the values of the An, Bn, Cn coeﬃcients (n=1, 2, 3):

i = [A1s + B1s′ + C1s′′] + C2[ss′′ + [s′]2] + C3[s2s′′ + 2s[s′]2]

Apply the HIM to the above equation with: i = exp(jω1t) + exp(jω2t) + exp(jω3t) and:

s =

Gklmexp[j(kω1 + lω2 + mω3)t]

∞

Xk,l,m=0

Proceeding as before (eq.18) we calculate the Gklm coeﬃcients as well as the various

Volterra transfer functions:

G000 = 0, G100 = H1(jω1), G010 = H1(jω2), G001 = H1(jω3),

G110 = H2(jω1, jω2), G101 = H2(jω1, jω3)

G011 = H2(jω2, jω3)

and ﬁnally G111 = H3(jω1, jω2, jω3)

(32)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

from eq.(30).

Collecting the terms multiplying exp[j(ω1 + ω2 + ω3)t] gives:

0 = [A1 + j(ω1 + ω2 + ω3)B1 − (ω1 + ω2 + ω3)2C1]G111

−2C2(ω1 + ω2 + ω3)2[2G110G001 + 2G101G010 + 2G100G011]

−3C3(ω1 + ω2 + ω3)2[6G100G010G001]

(33)

Using the above relations between the Gklm and the Hn ’s and (16) we get:

H3(jω1, jω2, jω3) = (ω1 + ω2 + ω3)2H1(j[ω1 + ω2 + ω3])[4C2{H2(jω1, jω2)H1(jω3)

+H2(jω1, jω3)H1(jω2) + H2(jω2, jω3)H1(jω1)}

+18C3H1(jω1)H1(jω2)H1(jω3)]

(34)

Using expressions (16) for H1(jω) and (19) for H2(jω1, jω2) along with eq.(11), (12) and

(13) the third order and intermodulation distortions can be evaluated and they agree again

with Darcie et al. [6] results.

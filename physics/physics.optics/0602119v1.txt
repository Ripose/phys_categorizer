Transmission spectra of metallic ﬁlms or membranes perforated by arrays of subwavelength slits
or holes have been widely interpreted as resonance absorption by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).
Alternative interpretations involving evanescent waves diﬀracted on the surface have also been pro-
posed. These two approaches lead to divergent predictions for some surface wave properties. Using
far-ﬁeld interferometry, we have carried out a series of measurements on elementary one-dimensional
(1-D) subwavelength structures with the aim of testing key properties of the surface waves and com-
paring them to predictions of these two points of view.

1000 to

Early reports of transmission through arrays of sub-
wavelength holes in thin ﬁlms and membranes [1, 2, 3],
enhanced well beyond conventional expectation [4] have
motivated numerous attempts to explain the underly-
ing physics of these surprising results. Since the early
experiments were carried out on metal ﬁlms, surface
plasmon polariton resonances [5, 6] were invoked to ex-
plain the anomalously high transmission and to sug-
gest new types of photonic devices [6]. Other interpre-
tations based on “dynamical diﬀraction” in periodic slit
and hole arrays [7, 8] or various kinds of resonant cav-
ity modes in 1-D slits and slit arrays [9, 10] have also
been proposed. Reassessment of the early claims by new
numerical studies [11] and new measurements [12] have
prompted a sharp downward revision of the enhanced
10 and have moti-
transmission factor from
vated the development of an alternative approach based
on a composite diﬀractive evanescent wave (CDEW) [12].
This model constructs a composite surface wave from the
distribution of diﬀracted evanescent modes (the inhomo-
geneous modes of the “angular spectrum representation”
of wave ﬁelds [13]) originating at an abrupt surface dis-
continuity such as a subwavelength-sized hole, slit, or
groove when irradiated by a train of plane waves. The
CDEW model exhibits three speciﬁc properties. First,
the surface wave is considered to be a composite of modes
labelled by the propagation vector component parallel to
the surface, and evanescent in the direction normal to
the surface. This composite “wave packet” exhibits well-
deﬁned, regular nodal positions spaced by a characteris-
tic wavelength, λsurf ; second, the appearance of the ﬁrst
node at a distance of λsurf /2 from the structured edge
implies an eﬀective phase delay of π/2 with respect to
the E-ﬁeld of the external driving source; and third, an
amplitude decreasing inversely with distance from the

≃

≃

launch site with an overall eﬀective range of a few mi-
crons.

We have fabricated 1-D structures (slits and grooves
with subwavelength widths) in thin silver ﬁlms deposited
on fused silica substrates designed to test these features
of the CDEW model. The optical response can be stud-
ied with the structures facing toward (input-side experi-
ments) or away from (output-side experiments) a distant
coherent plane-wave source. Results from the input-side
experiments, exhibiting light transmission interference as
a function of slit-groove distance, have been reported
elsewhere [14]. We report here measurements of output-
side, far-ﬁeld intensity fringes arising from interference
between propagating waves transmitted through the slit
and surface waves launched at the slit but, after travelling
along the surface, reconverted to outgoing waves at the
groove (see Fig. 2). Studies of fringe frequency, phase,
and contrast as a function of slit-groove distance and
groove depth provide new and complementary informa-
tion to the previously reported input-side experiments.

The subwavelength structures are fabricated by fo-
cused ion beam (FIB) milling (FEI Nova-600 Dual-Beam
system, Ga+ ions, 30keV) in a 400 nm thick layer of sil-
ver evaporated onto ﬂat fused silica microscope slides.
A low beam current (50 pA) is used in order to achieve
surface features deﬁned with a lateral precision on the
order of 10 nm and characterised by near-vertical side-
walls and a minimal amount of edge rounding. Since
it enables delivery of a variable ion dose to each pixel
of the writing ﬁeld, FIB milling conveniently allows the
multiple-depth topography characteristic of the present
devices to be formed in a single, self-aligned step. A 2-D
matrix of structures is milled into the silver layer. Each
matrix consists of 63 structures, nine columns, separated
by 1.5 mm, and seven rows, separated by 2 mm. The

Light transmission through the slits in this column is used
to normalise the transmission in the remaining columns.
Variations in transmission through each of the elements
in the “slits only” column provide a measure of the uni-
formity of the FIB fabrication process. The remaining
structures consist of slits ﬂanked on one side by a groove.
The groove-slit distance is systematically increased from
the initial to ﬁnal matrix positions. The square micro-
scope slides themselves are 25 mm on a side and 1 mm
thick.

Measurements were carried out using a home-built go-
niometer shown in Fig. 1. Output from a diode laser
source, temperature stabilised and frequency-locked to
the Cs 2S1/2(F = 4)
2P3/2(F = 4, 5) crossover feature
in a saturated absorption cell, is modulated at 850 Hz by
a mechanical chopper, injected into a monomode optical
ﬁbre, focused and linearly polarised (TM polarisation, H-
ﬁeld transverse to the slit) before impinging perpendicu-
larly on the structure matrix mounted in a sample holder.
The beam waist diameter and confocal parameter of the
illuminating source are 300 µm and 33 cm, respectively.
Throughout this series of measurements the laser power

density was maintained
itself is ﬁxed to a precision x-y translator, and individual
slit-groove structures of the 2-D matrix are successively
positioned at the laser beam waist. A photodiode detec-
tor is mounted at the end of a 200 mm rigid arm that
rotates about an axis passing through the centre of the
sample holder. A stepper motor drives the arm at cali-
brated angular increments of 2.05 mrad per step, and the
overall angular resolution of the goniometer is
4 mrad.
The photodetector output current passes to a lock-in am-
pliﬁer referenced to the optical chopper wheel. Data are
collected on a personal computer that also controls the
goniometer drive.

The structures consist of a single subwavelength slit,

100 nm wide ﬂanked by one subwavelength groove. Both
groove and slit are 20 µm long. We have carried out mea-
surements with grooves of two diﬀerent widths (100 nm
and 415 nm) and depths varying from 32 nm to 256 nm.
Here we report results only for the 100 nm grooves since
the wider structures yield similar results.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the far-ﬁeld intensity pattern
should exhibit interference fringes between Et directly
propagating through the slit and Eg radiating from the
grooves after having been transmitted by the surface
waves Esurf launched at the output side of the slit. The
frequency and phase of the interference pattern is a func-
tion of the optical path diﬀerence and any “intrinsic”
phase shift (e.g. due to groove shape or surface wave
phase lag) of Eg with respect to Et. Figure 3 shows in-
terference fringes at three representative slit-groove dis-
tances xsg as a function of the goniometer detector angle
θ. The fractional surface wave amplitude α, normalised
to the incoming plane wave amplitude Ei, α = Esurf /Ei,
is estimated from the Kowarz model [15] to be about
95%. The remaining 5% constitutes the amplitude frac-
tion δ of the light directly transmitted through the slit
Et. A further fraction β is reconverted to propagating
light Eg at the groove site xsg and interferes with Et.
The intensity, Ig, of the superposed wavefronts can be
expressed as

with l0 = xsg sin θ
and ϕ = ksurf xsg + ϕint. The re-
lations between l0, xsg, θ are shown in Fig. 2. The fre-
quency and phase of the interference pattern depend
on the slit-groove distance through the terms ksurf xsg,
and k0xsg sin θ. The term ϕint represents the “intrinsic”
phase shift due to groove geometry and surface wave gen-
eration at the slit edge. With the goniometer detector
oriented perpendicular to the structure plane (θ = 0),
Eq. 2 simpliﬁes to

Figure 4 plots a series of measurements of the far-ﬁeld
intensity as a function of the slit-groove distance xsg with
the detector angle at θ = 0. The interference term on the
right side of Eq. 3 is ﬁt to the data from which ϕint can
be determined by extrapolation of xsg to zero distance.
The magnitude of the surface wave propagation vector
is also determined from the ﬁt. We

input-side experiments reported earlier [14]. The intrinsic

In addition to the frequency and phase of the interfer-

Since ηo ∝

the dependence of this ﬁeld amplitude (and therefore the
surface wave amplitude) on the slit-groove distance. Fig-
ure 5 shows a plot of ηo as a function of xsg for narrow-
groove structures. The form of the ﬁtted curve through
the data points, an inverse distance dependence with an
additive constant, is given by Eq. 6 with ﬁtting parame-
ters µ, κ as indicated in the captions of Fig. 5.

We can now compare these results to predictions of
the CDEW model. Two key predictions are: (1) that the
amplitude of the composite surface wave decreases as the
inverse of the distance from the launch site, and (2) that
there is an intrinsic phase delay ϕint of π/2 between Et,
the directly transmitted wave and Esurf the composite

evanescent wave. Figure 5 shows that the contrast (and
therefore the amplitude of Eg) ﬁts well a 1/xsg behavior
for about the ﬁrst 3 microns, but then stabilises at a
constant contrast.

±

It appears therefore that there are two components to
the surface wave amplitude: a rapidly decreasing com-
ponent at short range followed by a constant component
at longer range. Figure 4 shows that ϕint extrapolates to
0.32 π
0.02 (not π/2) as xsg approaches zero. However,
it is well known that grooves exhibit “organ-pipe” phase
shifts and amplitude resonances when the eﬀective depth
is close to an integer number of quarter wavelengths [10].
In order to investigate this contribution to the intrinsic
phase we measured the contrast and phase as a function
of groove depth. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The
contrast indeed shows a maximum near 175 nm groove
depth. Around this resonance the phase lag from the
groove must be about modulo 2π, and therefore any
residual intrinsic phase between Et and Eg around the
groove resonance must be attributed to the phase delay
between the surface wave Esurf and the directly trans-
mitted wave Et. Figure 6 indeed shows that this resid-
ual phase is close to π/2, the signature phase lag of the
CDEW. Phase and amplitude data from the wide-groove
studies [16] are consistent with results reported here.

We conclude from these phase and amplitude results
that the surface waves exhibit both CDEW-like and SPP-
like properties. The initial decrease in interference con-
trast, ﬁtting well a 1/x behavior, at small slit-groove
distances is consistent with a diﬀractive surface pertur-
bation at the slit edge. The persistance of essentially
constant contrast at slit-groove distances greater than
2 µm indicates the presence of an an SPP-like long-
∼
lived mode propagating along the surface. It should be
noted, however, that the expected wavelength of a pure
SPP mode on a plane silver service is λSPP = 844 nm [5],
but the measured (Fig. 4) λsurf = 811
8. The reason for
the discrepancy is unclear but this “output-side” deter-
mination is consistent with the “input-side” results [14].
When the “organ-pipe” phase contributions are taken
into account, the results of Fig. 6 indicate that the the
persistant SPP-like wave conserves the CDEW signature
phase lag of π/2. The detailed nature of the conversion
from a diﬀracted surface wave packet to an SPP guided
wave has yet to be explained.

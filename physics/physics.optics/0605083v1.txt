Abstract

We investigate the reﬂection and refraction behaviors of electromagnetic waves at the interface

between an isotropic material and the anisotropic medium with a unique dispersion relation. We

show that the refraction angle of whether phase or energy ﬂow for E-polarized waves is opposite

to that for H-polarized waves, though the dispersion relations for E- and H-polarized waves are

the same in such anisotropic media. For a certain polarized wave the refraction behaviors of wave

vector and energy ﬂow are also signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.

It is found that waves exhibit diﬀerent

propagation behaviors in anisotropic media with diﬀerent sign combinations of the permittivity

and permeability tensors. Some interesting properties of propagation are also found in the special

anisotropic media, such as amphoteric refraction, oblique total transmission for both E- and H-

polarized waves, and the inversion of critical angle. The special anisotropic media can be realized

by metamaterials and lead to potential applications, such as to fabricate polarization splitters with

higher eﬃciencies than conventional counterparts.

INTRODUCTION

Over thirty years ago, Veselago pioneered the concept of left-handed material (LHM)

with simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability [1].

In this kind of

material, k, E and H form a left-handed set of vectors, and the material is thus called

left-handed material. It leads to many exotic electromagnetic properties among which the

most well-known is negative refraction and can be used to fabricate a perfect lens [2]. Since

the negative refraction was experimentally observed in a structured metamaterial formed

by split ring resonators and copper strips [3], the LHM has attracted much attention and

interest. By now, more experiments [4, 5] and numerical simulations [6, 7, 8, 9] have added

new proofs to the negative refraction. Moreover, it has been found that photonic crystals

[10, 11, 12, 13, 14], optical crystals [15] and anisotropic media [16, 17, 18, 19] can exhibit

negative refraction except for the isotropic material, so the concept of LHM should be

extended.

Recently, an increasing amount of eﬀort has been devoting to the study on negative refrac-

tion in anisotropic media. Lindell et al ﬁrstly studied the negative refraction in uniaxially

anisotropic media in which the permittivity tensor ε and the permeability tensor µ are not

necessarily negative [16]. In Refs. [18, 19, 20], the general behavior of wave propagations

in uniaxial media is investigated in detail. These researches are mainly concentrated on

isotropic and uniaxial media, but less work has been done on negative refraction in gen-

erally anisotropic media. In addition, only one kind of polarized waves, e.g., E-polarized

waves, is considered in the previous work on negative refraction in generally anisotropic me-

dia [21, 22, 23]. Then, one enquires naturally: How on earth are H-polarized waves refracted

in anisotropic media? Whether H-polarized waves are refracted anomalously or regularly

when E-polarized waves exhibit negative refraction?

In this paper, we investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the anisotropic

media with a uniform dispersion relation for any polarized waves. We demonstrate that the

refraction behaviors of both phase and energy ﬂow for E-polarized waves are diﬀerent from

those for H-polarized waves, though the dispersion relations for E- and H-polarized waves

are the same. Moreover, for a certain polarized wave the refraction behaviors of wave vector

and energy ﬂow are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. We also ﬁnd other interesting characteristics of

wave propagation, including oblique total transmission for both E- and H-polarized waves

and the inversion of critical angle. The special anisotropic media can be realized by metama-

2

terials and can lead to potential applications, such as to fabricate polarization splitters with

a higher eﬃciency than conventional counterparts. Our results show that it is necessary to

study the propagation of phase and energy ﬂow for both E- and H-polarized waves in order

to obtain a complete knowledge on characteristics of wave propagation in anisotropic media.

This paper is organized in the following way. Section II gives the unique dispersion of any

polarized waves in the special anisotropic media. We discuss the reﬂection and refraction

at the interface between an isotropic regular material and the special anisotropic medium

in Sec. III. Section IV shows in detail that the reﬂection and refraction characteristics of

waves are diﬀerent in the anisotropic media with diﬀerent sign combinations of ε and µ,

gives corresponding numerical results, and discuss how to realize the media. A summary is

given in Sec. V.

II. DISPERSION RELATIONS

In this section we present the dispersion relation of electromagnetic wave propagation in

the special anisotropic media.

For simplicity, we assume the permittivity and permeability tensors of the anisotropic

media are simultaneously diagonal in the principal coordinate system,

Note that the anisotropic medium can be realized by metamaterials composed of periodic

arrays of split-ring resonators and conducting wires [23, 24, 25], or of periodic inductor-

capacitor loaded transmission line circuits [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. In order to disclose

the basic characteristics of the propagation of waves, we do not consider losses here as in

Refs. [16, 18, 21], though no practical material is ideally lossless. In fact, the metamaterial

of low losses has been realized [32]. To simplify the analyses, we assume the medium in a

Cartesian coordinates (O, x, y, z) coincident with the principal coordinate system and ex,

ey, ez are unit vectors along the axes.

Let us consider a plane wave of angular frequency ω propagating from an isotropic regular

material into the special anisotropic medium. We assume that the electric ﬁeld is E =
E0eik·r−iωt and that the magnetic ﬁeld is H = H0eik·r−iωt. The dispersion relation of plane

where C is a constant, and qj denotes the component of the wave vector q in the j direction

(j = x, y, z). When C > 0, the anisotropic medium is regarded quasiisotropic because E-

and H-polarized waves in it exhibits the same propagation behaviors, just as in isotropic

medium [20, 33, 34].

In the present paper we are interested in the anisotropic medium

with C < 0. We shall show that E- and H-polarized waves exhibits diﬀerent propagation

behaviors. That is why such anisotropic media can not be regarded as quasiisotropic. The

surface of wave vectors decided by the dispersion relation with C < 0 in wave-vector space

is always a single-sheet hyperboloid as shown in Fig. 1.

For simplicity we assume in the rest of the paper that the incident, reﬂected and refracted

waves are all in the x-z plane, the boundary is at z = 0 and the z axis is directed into the

anisotropic medium. Then we can write the incident angle as

The refraction of phase is regarded regular if kz · q > 0 and anomalous if kz · q < 0. In

general the occurrence of refraction requires that the z component of the refracted wave

vector must be real. According to Eqs. (2) and (4) we obtain

III. REFLECTION, REFRACTION AND BREWSTER ANGLES

In this section we discuss the reﬂection and refraction between an isotropic regular ma-

terial and the special anisotropic medium. We show that the refraction angles of both

phase and energy ﬂow for E-polarized waves are opposite to the corresponding parts for

H-polarized, though the dispersion relations for E- and H-polarized waves are the same in

the special anisotropic medium.

For E-polarized plane wave the electric ﬁelds can be expressed as

We should note that the sign of q(E) · S(E)

can not be used to demonstrate whether the

refraction of energy ﬂow is regular or anomalous as in isotropic or uniaxial anisotropic

material [16, 18]. Instead, we consider the inner product of the tangential component of

Likewise, whether the refraction of energy ﬂow for H-polarized waves is regular is decided

by the sign of εz. Evidently, if µx 6= µz or εx 6= εz in Eqs. (13) or (16), then a bending angle

always exists between k and S, and therefore k, E and H can not form a strictly left-handed

system. Further, k is not coincident with S judging by Eqs. (14) and (17). This point can

be seen more clearly in the next section. The refraction angle of the energy ﬂow is deﬁned
to be βS = tan−1 [Sx/Sz]. Using Eq. (13) and (16) we thus have

for E- and H-polarized waves, respectively.

Let us note that the refraction direction should obey two rules: The tangential compo-

nents of the incident, reﬂected, refracted wave vectors on the interface are continuous; The

Poynting vector of the refracted wave points away from the interface. Embodied in the

problem we are concerned with, the two rules are: qx = kx and ST z > 0. Then, making use

of Eqs. (5) and (7), we ﬁnd there exists a critical value

θC = sin−1

εzµy
εIµI (cid:21)

(cid:20)r

for the incident angle if 0 < εzµy < εIµI. At the same time, from Eqs. (13) and (16), we
conclude that q(E)

z must have the same sign as µx for E-polarized waves and q(H)

z must have

the same sign as εx for H-polarized waves. Therefore, the sign of µx suggests whether the

refraction of phase in Eq. (6) is regular or anomalous for E-polarized waves, and the sign

of εx does the same for H-polarized waves. Considering Eq. (8) and εx/µx < 0, we come to

the conclusion

That is to say, the refraction angle of the phase for E-polarized wave is always opposite to

that for H-polarized wave. Then, together with Eqs. (3), (18) and (20), we ﬁnd

β(E)
P = −β(H)

which means that the refraction angle of energy ﬂow for E-polarized wave is always opposite

We next explore the problem of oblique total transmission. The reﬂectivity and the

waves. Then we have for E and H-polarized waves

It is easy to show that rE + tE = 1 and rH + tH = 1, which indicates the power conservation

on the boundary. When rE = 0 or rH = 0, the incident angle is known as the Brewster

angle [24]. Substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. (23), we ﬁnd that when the condition

0 <

µz(εyµI − εIµx)
εI(µ2
I − µxµz)

< 1

is satisﬁed, the Brewster angle for E-polarized wave is

Similarly, inserting Eq. (15) into Eq. (24) we can see that under the condition

there exists a Brewster angle for H-polarized wave

(28)

At the Brewster angle, the reﬂectivity is zero and the oblique total transmission occurs. It

is worthy of mentioning that such oblique total transmissions for E- and H-polarized waves

can not occur simultaneously in a conventional isotropic material. Therefore the oblique

total transmission is due to the anisotropy of the material [19].

IV. DETAILED ANALYSES AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the following we shall apply the conclusions in the above section to exploring in detail

the reﬂection and refraction characteristics at the boundary between an isotropic material

and the special anisotropic medium. Aggregately there are six kinds of sign combinations for

ε and µ of the anisotropic medium. We show that with diﬀerent sign combinations of ε and

µ, the behavior of propagation is diﬀerent. According to the curve form of refracted wave

vector at a ﬁxed frequency (isofrequency curve) in the wave vector plane [21] we discuss in

three cases.

A.

the isofrequency curve is a hyperbola with foci on the kx axis

When the signs of the permittivity and permeability tensors are chosen as ε = (−, −, +)

and µ = (+, +, −), the isofrequency curve of the refracted wave vector is a hyperbola with

the foci in the kx axis, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Note that this case corresponds to the

For the E-polarized wave the wave vector is refracted regularly, but the Poynting vector

is refracted anomalously. For the H-polarized wave the situation is just opposite. More

If 0 < εzµy < εIµI, the refraction can occur only if the incident angle is in the branch

where θC is the critical angle deﬁned by Eq. (19), or else 0 < |θI| < π/2. That is to say, the

incident angle can be larger than the critical angle, diﬀerent from the regular situation where

the incident angle is smaller than the critical angle. At the same time, using Eqs. (19), (26)

and (28) one can easily show that the Brewster angle is larger than the critical angle

This phenomenon is called the inversion of critical angle [19, 24]. From Eqs. (23) and (24)

one can show that a bit shift of θI from θC can lead to a big change in reﬂectivity, as can

be seen in Fig. 3.

angle.

If the signs of the permittivity and permeability are chosen as ε = (+, +, −) and µ =

(−, −, +), the iso-frequency curve of the refracted wave vector is shown in Fig. 2(b). We

can see that the refraction behaviors of E- and H-polarized waves are just opposite to the

counterparts in Fig. 2(a), though the dispersion relation is invariant. This is due to the sign

inversions of ε and µ in Fig. 2(b) compared with those in Fig. 2(a)

For the purpose of illustration, a numerical example is given in Fig. 3. We ﬁnd that

there exists a Brewster angle for both E- and H-polarized waves and that the Brewster

angles are larger than the critical angle. This phenomenon is diﬀerent from the situation

in conventional isotropic nonmagnetic materials where the Brewster angle only exists for

H-polarized waves. In a regular nonmagnetic material, the physical mechanism of Brewster

angle is that the component of energies radiated by electric dipoles under the eﬀect of

transmitted electric ﬁelds is zero along the direction perpendicular to the reﬂected wave

[35]. However, the appearance of Brewster angles here relies on parameters of ε and µ.

First, let us consider an example: For a light incident from a regular magnetic material with
ε = 1 and µ = 2 into another regular material with ε′ = 1 and µ′ = 1, there exists a Brewster

angle for E-polarized waves. Evidently, the cause is not the response of electric dipoles, but

the response of magnetic dipoles [21]. Therefore, the existence of Brewster angles for E-

and H-polarized waves here is due to the compound operations of the electric and magnetic

the isofrequency curve is an ellipse

If the signs of the permittivity and permeability tensors have the form of ε = (−, +, −)

and µ = (+, −, +), the isofrequency curve of the refracted wave vector is an ellipse as shown

in Fig. 4 (a). This case corresponds to the cutoﬀ indeﬁnite medium in Ref. [23]. For this

case we ﬁnd

The wave vector and the Poynting vector are both refracted regularly for the E-polarized

wave, while anomalously for the H-polarized wave. By virtue of the analyses in the previous

section, we obtain

P = −β(H)

P > 0, β(E)

S = −β(H)

S > 0.

From the ﬁgure we can also see that, when 0 < εzµy < εIµI, the refraction can occur only

if the incident angle is in the branch

In the case of ε = (+, −, +)

and µ = (−, +, −) the isofrequency curve of the refracted wave vector is shown in Fig. 4

(b). We can see that the refraction behaviors of the E- and H-polarized waves are just the

results after exchanging the E- and H-polarized waves in Fig. 4 (a). This result manifests

again that E- and H-polarized waves do not necessarily exhibit the same propagation,

even if their dispersion relations are the same. As an example, we examine the case of

ε = (−0.5, 0.4, −1) and µ = (1, −0.8, 2), with the results illustrated in Fig. 5. We ﬁnd that

there exists a Brewster angle for H-polarized waves. Actually, we can choose appropriate

material parameters of ε and µ for E-polarized waves to exhibit a Brewster angle.

C.

the isofrequency curve is a hyperbola with foci in the kz axis

If the signs of the permittivity and permeability are of the form ε = (−, +, +) and

µ = (+, −, −), the isofrequency curve of the refracted wave vector is a hyperbola with the

foci in the z axis, as shown in Fig. 6 (a). Let us note that this case corresponds to the never

cutoﬀ indeﬁnite medium in Ref. [23]. In view of the discussions in the previous section, we

For the E-polarized wave the wave vector is refracted regularly, but the Poynting vector is

refracted anomalously. For the H-polarized wave the situation is just opposite. It is easy to

show that

Diﬀerent from the case shown in Fig. 2 (a), there does not exist any critical value for the

incident angle, namely

0 < |θI| < π/2.

(40)

(41)

As for the case of ε = (+, −, −) and µ = (−, +, +), the isofrequency curve of the refracted

wave vector is shown in Fig. 6 (b). We can see that the refraction behaviors of E- and

H-polarized waves are just opposite to those in Fig. 6 (a). We give a numerical result of

ε = (−0.5, 0.4, 1) and µ = (1, −0.8, −2) in Fig. 7. We ﬁnd that there exists a Brewster

angle for E-polarized waves.

In the above discussions we ﬁnd that E-polarized waves propagate remarkably distinct

from H-polarized waves in the special anisotropic media. The two polarized waves are

always refracted into diﬀerent directions. Even if the propagation direction is along one

principal axis, the two eigenmodes for one propagation direction are always in two diﬀerent
directions, i.e., q(E)

for one qx. Then, the refractive indices n are always diﬀerent

z = −q(H)

for the two polarizations and are relevant to the propagation directions. Meanwhile, optic

axes are the directions for which the two values of the phase velocity vp = c/n are equal

[33, 36]. Accordingly, there does not exist any optic axis in the anisotropic medium, and the

concept of ordinary waves or extraordinary waves in uniaxial materials is not valid here. In

this sense, waves in the anisotropic medium all can be regarded as extraordinary waves. The

property that the two eigenmodes for one propagation direction are always refracted into

two diﬀerent directions indicates that the anisotropic media are polarization-sensitive and

can be put into potential applications, such as dividing a beam into two pure polarizations.

The polarization beam splitter made of such media can divide beams with larger splitting

angles and splitting distances than conventional ones [37]. In the above discussions we have

assumed that the principal axes are coincident with the coordinate axes in which the media

lie. If not so, new propagation phenomena will occur except for those in the above and one

can investigate this issue by methods in Refs. [17, 22, 35].

Finally, we discuss how to realize the anisotropic media of a unique dispersion. Several

recent developments make the special anisotropic media available. Firstly, metamaterials

composed of periodic arrays of split-ring resonators and conducting wires have been demon-

strated to be able to construct anisotropic media of the unique dispersion relation [24, 25, 38].

A more promising choice is the metamaterial composed of periodic inductor-capacitor loaded

transmission line circuits because it has lower loss and wider bandwidth [26, 30, 32, 39]. Such

metamaterials can also exhibit the above dispersion relations. In addition, certain designs of

14

photonic crystals have been shown to be able to model the dispersion relation of anisotropic

materials [40, 41, 42]. Therefore, there is no physical or technical obstacles to make the

special anisotropic media.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have investigated the wave propagation in anisotropic media for which

the dispersion relation of any polarized waves is the same. We have analysed the reﬂection

and refraction behaviors of electromagnetic waves at the interface between an isotropic

regular medium and the anisotropic media. We show that in the anisotropic media, the

refraction angles of both phase and energy ﬂow for E-polarized waves are opposite to the
counterparts for H-polarized waves, that is, β(E)

and β(E)

S , though the

P = −β(H)

S = −β(H)

P

dispersion relation for E-polarized waves is the same as that for H-polarized waves. The

refraction behaviors of wave vector and energy ﬂow are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for a certain

polarized wave. In addition, we ﬁnd many interesting characteristics of wave propagation

in the medium. Firstly, the wave propagation exhibits diﬀerent behaviors with diﬀerent

sign combinations of the permittivity and permeability tensors. Secondly, the reﬂection

coeﬃcient becomes zero at certain angles not only for H-polarized wave but also for E-

polarized wave. Therefore it is reasonable to extend the concept of Brewster angle from

H-polarized wave to E-polarized wave. Lastly, the Brewster angle can be larger than the

critical angle, which is called the inversion of critical angle. Our results indicate that it is

necessary to study the propagation of the phase and the energy for both E- and H-polarized

waves in order to obtain a complete knowledge on the wave propagation in anisotropic media.

Due to the unique dispersion relation, characteristics of electromagnetic wave propagation

in the special anisotropic media are remarkably distinct from those in isotropic or uniaxial

LHM. The most attracting one is that the anisotropic media are polarization-sensitive, which

can lead to many applications, such as to fabricate polarization splitters with higher eﬃ-

ciencies than conventional counterparts. Before we end this paper, we stress that the special

anisotropic media can be realized by anisotropic metamaterials having been constructed in

laboratory [24, 25, 32, 39]. Then the properties of wave propagation in them can be studied

experimentally and favorable applications can be realized by the anisotropic media.

1. Introduction

Photonic crystal ﬁbres (PCFs), whose cladding is composed of a two-dimensional (2D)
photonic crystal [1, 2], may conﬁne and guide light through either a photonic bandgap
eﬀect [3, 4] or by an eﬀective high refractive index guiding mechanism [5, 6]. Both
classes of ﬁbres have been the subject of numerous research and for a review we
refer to Refs. [7, 8] and references therein. The latter class of PCFs has attractive
features such as, broad-band single-mode (SM) operation [9], possibilities for dispersion
engineering [10, 11], and tailorable mode area [12]. The 2D photonic crystal of the
cladding not only provides more design freedom on engineering basic properties of the
ﬁbre, but also broadens the potential application of PCFs by the freedom to remove
more air holes from the cladding [13, 14, 15] or by introducing additional materials to
the air holes [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], both of which facilitate novel device operations based on
PCFs. In the present work, the ”PCF device” term is restricted to the ones obtained by
removing some holes from the cladding such as, PCF couplers [13, 14], PCF polarization
beam splitters [15], or PCF distributed Bragg reﬂectors [21].

In the present paper, we describe an approach, which relies on modal transmission-
line theory (MTLT), for three-dimensional (3D) investigations of the propagation of an
optical beam launched into a PCF device. According to our knowledge only the ﬁnite
element beam propagation method (FE-BPM) [22] has been adopted and utilized for
doing such simulations. The FE-BPM is numerically robust, versatile, and applicable
to a wide variety of structures. Unfortunately, this is often achieved at the expense of
long computational times and large memory requirements, both of which can become
critical issues especially when structures with large dimensions are considered or when
used within an iterative design environment.
MTLT, which has been developed for modelling multi-layered periodic media [23, 24, 25,
26, 27], has been used for analysis of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers [25, 26], quantum
well infrared photodetectors (QWIP) [28], holographic power splitter/combiners [29]
and grating assisted integrated optics devices [30]. Recently, it has also successfully
been applied in a study of radiation ﬁelds from end-facet PCFs [31]. MTLT relies on
Interpreting

the plane waves as transmission-lines provides a systematic framework for study of
wave propagation in multi-layered periodic media. Besides that, one can exploit all the
concepts and methods of transmission-line theory [32] and electrical network theory [33]
for the study of wave propagation. MTLT has recently been developed for modal analysis
of arbitrary shape optical waveguides [34]. Here, we add a novel approach to this theory
and utilize it for a three-dimensional study of propagation of light in photonic crystal
ﬁbre devices.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a
brief account of MTLT and describe the approach we use. In Section 3 we investigate
examples that illustrate the utilization of this approach in the modelling of PCF devices.
Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4.

2. Formalism

The typical PCF device that we have in mind is composed of J layers with diﬀerent
relative permittivity functions ǫrj(x, y), j = 1, 2, · · · , J, which is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.
We deﬁne zj as a convenient local coordinate obeying 0 ≤ zj = z − hj−1 ≤ tj and we
consider wave propagation along the longitudinal direction of the structure, i.e. z-axis.
Throughout this paper we consider non-magnetic materials with relative permeability
µr = 1 and all electromagnetic ﬁelds have a harmonic temporal dependence, exp(iωt).
PCF devices with the typical shape shown in ﬁgure 1, usually conﬁne light within the
ﬁbre core or cores. However, some application such as long-period ﬁbre Bragg gratings
do not share this feature so in the present study we exclude these applications. For the
applications with spatially localized modes we use a super-cell approach and repeat the
structure in the transverse xy-plane, along x and y directions with periodicities of Tx
and Ty, respectively. It is assumed that the periodically repeated devices are separated
by a suﬃcient amount of background region, here microstructured cladding, that their
electromagnetic ﬁelds do not aﬀect each other signiﬁcantly.

We want to study a PCF device when it is illuminated with an incident ﬁeld
~Einc(~r) propagating in layer 1 of the structure shown in ﬁgure 1. This incident ﬁeld
is a solution to the source-free Maxwell equations in the PCF with the refractive index
proﬁle of layer 1. In this section we brieﬂy address MTLT and modal analysis of optical
waveguides using this theory. Subsequently we describe an approach, based on MTLT,
for investigating the scattering and propagation of light in PCF devices. Throughout
the paper, vectorial components are denoted by an arrow placed above them. The bold-
style notation with uppercase and lowercase characters is used to designate matrices
and vectors, respectively.

2.1. Modal Transmission-Line Theory

Embody a periodic medium with permittivity variation ǫ0ǫr(x, y) = ǫ0ǫr(x + Tx, y + Ty)
and permeability µ0. The permittivity can then conveniently be expressed in the form
of a two-dimensional Fourier series [26]

where, ~K0 = Kx0 ˆx + Ky0 ˆy is the Bloch wave-vector and ~A can be any of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds ~E, ~H, or ~D. In order to facilitate calculations in matrix form, we
introduce ~e, ~h, and ~d vectors whose elements are ~emn, ~hmn, and ~dmn, respectively. The
dimension of each vectorial component of the ~e, ~h, or ~d vectors in Cartesian coordinates
(i.e. ex, ey, ez, hx, etc.) is 1 × (2N + 1)(2M + 1). Using these vectors, the constitutive
relation ~D = ǫ0ǫr ~E converts into ~d = ǫ0N~e, where N is a square matrix whose elements
are ˜ǫmn and they are arranged in N in such a way that the equality ~d = ǫ0N~e holds.
The temporal harmonic electromagnetic ﬁelds in a dielectric medium are solutions of
the following source-free Maxwell equations
∇ × ~E(~r) = −iωµ0 ~H(~r)

Using (1), (3), and vectors ~e, ~h and ~d in the source-free Maxwell equations (4), these
equations are transformed into the following system of diﬀerential equations:

Likewise, inductance and capacitance matrices of the multi-conductor transmission-line

with non-zero oﬀ-diagonal elements. We can formally diagonalize ω2LC and ω2CL
matrices using relations ω2LC = PK2P−1 and ω2CL = QK2Q−1, where K2 is a
diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements of K2 are eigenvalues of ω2LC or ω2CL. Here,
P and Q are matrices whose columns are the eigenvectors of their relevant non-diagonal
matrices. Once the K2 and P have been determined, the matrix Q is also given by
ωCPK−1.

In this new basis the transmission-lines are uncoupled and one may, in analogy with
conductance eigen-channels in quantum transport [35], think of these new lines as the
eigen-lines of the transmission-line system. Wave propagation in the periodic medium

the diagonal matrix K2 considering the following condition [24]:

the ω2LC describes

Im(Kk) + Re(Kk) < 0.

(10)

Electromagnetic ﬁelds of each space harmonic with a speciﬁed propagation constant are
determined from its relevant eigenvector.

2.2. Equivalent Network of Multi-Layered Media

Consider the typical structure shown in ﬁgure 1. The modelling task begins by
periodically repeating the device in the transverse xy-plane with suﬃciently large
periodicities. As discussed above, wave propagation in each layer of this periodically
repeated structure could be modelled by a transmission-line network whose behavior
is described by (8). Schematically, the equivalent transmission-line network of the j-th
layer of this structure is depicted in ﬁgure 2 (a). In this ﬁgure the box containing Pj, Qj
represents the consideration in (9).
A concise and eﬀective formulation of voltages and currents of this transmission-line
network can be described by:

the structure, the well-known radiation condition of electromagnetic theory is applied,
which is depicted in the equivalent network by match load. Here we exploit a primary
feature of radiation condition; i.e. the zero reﬂection at these points.

2.3. The Approach

Consider the structure shown in ﬁgure 1. When this structure is illuminated with an
incident electromagnetic ﬁeld ~Einc(~r), propagating in layer 1 along the positive direction
of z-axis, the total ﬁeld in layer 1, ~E1(~r), is given by
~E1(~r) = ~Einc(~r) + ~E1,r(~r)

(13)
where ~E1,r(~r) is the reﬂected ﬁeld inside layer 1. The incident ﬁeld is usually a ﬁbre
mode so for investigating its interaction with other layers we must calculate it and then
calculate ~E1,r(~r) and ﬁnally ~E1(~r). From the known ﬁeld at layer 1, we calculate the
ﬁelds in other layers utilizing equations (11) and (12).
Since the incident ﬁeld ~Einc(~r) is a guided mode of the waveguide with refractive
index proﬁle of layer 1, we could determine it utilizing MTLT, exploiting the features
of transmission-lines [34]. This calculation is achieved by examining the out of
plane propagation of a periodic medium whose refractive index variation is obtained
by periodically repeating the waveguide in transverse plane with suﬃciently large
periodicities. Evidently from transmission-line theory, the matrix ω2LC contains the
information of the out of plane propagating waves, called space harmonics in the ﬁeld
of diﬀraction grating [23]. Eigenvalues of the matrix ω2LC, diagonal elements of K2,
specify squared-values of propagation constants of these space harmonics. Each column
of the matrix P, an eigenvector of the matrix ω2LC, describe the electric ﬁeld proﬁle
of its relevant eigenvalue. Among the space harmonics the ones whose ﬁeld proﬁles are
localized within the waveguide specify guided modes of the waveguide. In index guiding
waveguides this condition is simpliﬁed to the refractive index guiding condition.
Through the modal analysis of the ﬁbre with layer 1 refractive index proﬁle we determine
vj,inc(z = 0). Afterwards,
for complete determination of ﬁeld in the ﬁrst layer,
ij,r(z = 0) is also required. These values are obtained

local geometry zj; for instance Ru
01 is the upward reﬂectance matrix at zj = 0 for j = 1.

3. Validation and Numerical Implementations

In this section, several examples will be considered to illustrate and also validate the
utilization of the proposed approach.

3.1. PCF coupler

The cross-section of the PCF-coupler we want to study is depicted in the inset of ﬁgure 4.
It is composed of a triangular lattice of air-holes in silica with two missing air holes. We
validate the described approach in the present paper by verifying the coupling action
of the coupler and comparing the obtained coupling length through this approach with
the one obtained by considering even and odd modes.
In the simulation the pitch,
Λ = 7.2 µm, and normalized hole-diameter to the pitch, d/Λ = 0.45 have been set. We
perform the simulation at the normalized wavelength λ/Λ = 2πc/(ωΛ) = 0.1.
In simulation it is assumed that the light is launched into one core of the coupler, for
instance core A, by butt-coupling of a similar single-core ﬁbre whose core is aligned to
the core A. The coupler and the ﬁbre coupled to it constitute a two layer medium, which
could be considered an example of the general case of ﬁgure 1.

As it is described in Section 2.2, at ﬁrst we repeat the structure periodically in
the transverse xy-plane with 10Λ × 10Λ periodicity. Fiber cores of both the single-core,
ﬁrst layer, and the double-core, second layer, are considered as defects so treated by
the supercell approach [36]. We calculate the fundamental mode of the single-core ﬁber
using a MTLT-based approach of [34] which has been brieﬂy described in Section 2.3.
Through the simulation we obtain the ﬁber mode as the voltage and current vectors
ij,inc(z = 0). These vectors describe the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the
vj,inc(z = 0) and
ﬁber and are related to the ﬁelds through the Eqs. (7) and (9). Evidently from (3)
the ﬁber mode is the weighted summation of individual plane waves with diﬀerent wave

vectors. From the known
the structure will be computed by tracking the approach described in Section 2.3.

vj,inc(z = 0) and

We illustrate in ﬁgure 5 the normalized electric ﬁeld intensity when the HE11 mode
of the single-core ﬁbre, travelling across the z-axis, is launched into the core A of the
dual-core ﬁbre. Inside the dual-core ﬁbre, the light starts coupling from the core A to
core B. Up to the distance of 1440 µm from the interface of the coupler and single-core
ﬁbre (z = 2.44 cm) all the conﬁned light in the core A will be coupled to the core B.
This distance is called coupling length, Lc, and alternatively may be computed from
the diﬀerence of the propagation constants of even, βe, and odd, βo, modes of the dual-
core ﬁbre through the relation of Lc = π/ | βe − βo |. The computed coupling length
between the even and odd modes in translational invariant system is 1410 µm, which
is in a good agreement with that obtained through the approach of this paper. The
normalized intensity of electric ﬁeld in the center of core A is depicted in ﬁgure 4. The
coupling length has been indicated on the ﬁgure.

3.2. PCF Bragg grating

The case of a PCF Bragg grating arises in various advanced applications of photonic
crystals. In PCF lasers an optical cavity may be formed through two PCF Bragg gratings
created by introducing a spatial periodic modulation of the refractive index to the ﬁbre
core along the ﬁbre axis [21]. Photonic crystal vertical cavity surface emitting laser (PC-
VCSEL) [38] is a novel application of the photonic crystal in the laser application, which
is similar to standard VCSELs except that a photonic crystal structure is deﬁned by
introducing regular lattice of air-holes with one missing air-hole to the top mirror. These
lasers, as well as the single mode operation, have side-mode suppression ratios about
35-40dB [39]. These attractive features are facilitated by the presence of the regular
lattice of air holes as has been studied qualitatively utilizing concepts of PCFs [39].
Using the approach described in this paper, the reﬂectivity from the top mirror could
be investigated three-dimensionally. The modelling of the laser mirrors is generally a
crucial issue in the design and analysis of lasers [40]. Here we analyze an example of
an in-plane grating in a PCF to illustrate the proposed approach. The structure under
consideration is depicted in ﬁgure 6. The cross section of each layer is a square-lattice
photonic crystal composed of air holes in the background material with one missing
air hole. The layers speciﬁed by white color have refractive index 1.45 and the colored
ones have refractive index 1.6. The air-holes of normalized diameter d/Λ = 0.53 are
arranged on a square lattice with pitch Λ = 7.2 µm. Such mirrors have recently been
utilized as the top distributed Bragg reﬂector of PC-VCSELs [41].
In the structure
the thickness of colored layers, t, is 0.12 µm and the periodicity of the Bragg mirror
is a = 0.245 µm. Utilizing the approach of this paper, we examine the interaction
of the travelling fundamental mode of the ﬁrst layer with the grating at λ/Λ = 0.1.
Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional intensity plot of the electric ﬁeld in the case where
the fundamental mode of the squared-lattice PCF (with lattice index of 1.45) is incident

Dabirian et al.: Propagation of Light in Photonic Crystal Fibre Devices

on the mirror. The incident ﬁeld is partially reﬂected at interfaces of diﬀerent layers,
leading to an interference pattern caused by interference of the incident ﬁeld and the
reﬂected ones. Figure 7 also illustrates how perfectly boundary conditions at diﬀerent
material interfaces of the distributed Bragg mirror are fulﬁlled.

4. Conclusions

Optical properties of PCFs may typically be successfully analyzed within the assumption
of translational invariance along the ﬁbre axis. However, in real life the important device
applications employ PCFs of ﬁnite length and the hypothesis of translational invariance
is not applicable. In this work we have described a semi-analytical approach for three-
dimensional fully vectorial analysis of photonic crystal ﬁbre devices. Our approach
rest on the foundation of modal transmission-line theory and oﬀers a computationally
competitive alternative to beam propagation methods. The approach is illustrated by
simulations of the coupling action in a photonic crystal ﬁbre coupler and the modal
reﬂectivity in a photonic crystal ﬁbre distributed Bragg reﬂector.

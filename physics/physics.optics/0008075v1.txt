Abstract

In two models it is shown that a light pulse propagates from a vacuum

into certain media with velocity greater than that of a light in a vacuum (c).

By numerical calculation the propagating properties of such a light are given.

Recently L. J. Wang and his collaborators in their experiment [1] have found

that the group velocity of a laser pulse in particularly prepared atomic caesium gas

can much exceed that of light in a vacuum (c). Here we will explore the problem

from a theoretical piont of view. Many years ago A. Sommerfeld rigorously proved

[2] that the velocity of light pulse can not exceed c in absorption media. We call this

conclusion as basic theorem afterwardz. In the following we will ﬁrst examine why

usually the basic theorem holds and in what condition it will be violated. Then two

models are proposed, where with precise numerical calculation we will show that

the basic theorem is indeed violated. Therefore the properties of light propagating

in media of the models are given. We believe that these properties may appears in

more realistic models.

Let a light pulse propagating along x axis toward its positive direction in a

vacuum (x < 0), at time t = 0 arriving at x = 0, and then entering into a medium

(x ≥ 0) afterwards. At x = 0, the amplitude of the light pulse changes with time t

as

F (t)

t ≥ 0

0

t < 0 .

f (t) = 


Usually f(t) can be rigorously expressed in Fourier integration as

f (t) = ReZ ∞

A(n)e−intdn .

(2)

For simplicity suppose there is no reﬂection of light at x = 0. The amplitude of the

light pulse entering into the medium (x ≥ 0) is [2]

f (t, x) = ReZ ∞

0

A(n)e−int+ikxdn ,

(3)

where k = nµ(n)/c and µ(n) is the complex refractive index of the medium, which

depends on the frequency of incident light (dispersion).

In vacuum (x < 0), the

amplitude of the light pulse is

g(t, x) = ReZ ∞

A(n)e−int+inx/cdn

(x < 0)

= f (t − x/c) = 


F (t − x/c)

t − x/c ≥ 0

0

t − x/c < 0 .

(4)

The shape of the light pulse propagating in a vacuum does not change because all

its Fourier components in (4) propagate with the same velocity c and do not decay.

In particular, all these components completely cancel each other in the space-time

region t − x/c < 0 (or θ = t c/x < 1) as long as the light pulse propagates in a

vacuum. One may think that such a cancellation may not occur when light pulse

propagates in a medium because of dispersion and absorption. But Sommerfeld

proved that such cancellation also occurs when light pulse propagates in absorption

media, which is just the basic theorem. In his proving Sommerfeld let

so that (3) becomes [2]

f (t, x) =

f (t) = 

(7)

which is the Lorentz-Lorenz refraction formula. a2, n0, ρ are the constants of the
medium. n0, ρ represent the characteristic absorption frequency, damping constant
of the medium. Usually ρ > 0, light propagating in the medium decays. The

integration path c in (6) is shown in Fig.1, which is along the real axis of n from

+∞ to −∞ through n = ν by a small semicircle in the upper half of the complex

plane. µ(n) in (7) has branch pionts:

U1,2 = −iρ ±qn2
N1,2 = −iρ ±qn2

0 − ρ2 , where µ = ∞ ;

0 + a2 − ρ2 , where µ = 0 .

We joing U1 to N1 and U2 to N2 by two branch lines, which lie in the lower half of
the complex plane, when ρ > 0. Because there is no singularity and branch lines of

the integrand of (6) in the upper half plane, one can replace the integration path

c by u in Fig.1, which is parallel to the real axis in the upper half plane. When u

moves to inﬁnity in the upper half plane, µ → 1 and when t − x/c < 0, then (6)

= 0, which is just the basic theorem. But when ρ < 0 (this is our model 1), the

branch lines U1N1 and U2N2 lie in the upper half plane and the integration path u
is not equivalent to the path c in (6). Now the equivalent path u should be taken as

u1 +u2 +u3 +u4 in Fig.1. By the same argument above, integration along u1 vanishs.
Integrations along a pair of u2 cancel each other. The remaining integations along
u3 and u4 usually do not vanish because the branch lines lie in them. Therefore
when ρ < 0 (model 1), the basic theorem does not hold. In the following we will do

numerical integration of (6) to show that the basic theorem is indeed violated and to

see what happens. ρ < 0 means propagation of light in the medium is gain-assisted

light propagation.

From (6) we get

f (t, x) =

where γw(¯n) = −int+inµx/c; γ = xn0/c, ¯n = n/n0, ¯ν = ν/n0, ¯a2 = a2/n2
all of them are dimensionless. Let

0, ¯ρ = ρ/n0,

w(z) = X(z) + iY (z) .

(9)

When z >> 1,

X(z) ∼ −¯a2 ¯ρ/z2 ,

Y (z) ∼ z(1 − θ) − ¯a2/(2z) ,

(10)

where θ = ct/x.

In reference [2], the typical values of parameters are given as

n0 = 4 × 1016 s−1,

a2 = 1.24 n2
0,

ρ = 0.07 n0 ,

(11)

where the medium is solid or liquid. For gas a2 is about 1.001.

The numerical integration for (8) is diﬃcult when | γY (z) | becomes very large
and hence eγY (z) is a very fast oscillatory function of z. In fact when n0 = 4×1016 s−1
and x = 1cm, γ = 4
3 × 106 is very large. But if γ < 100 for example, i.e., x <
7.5 × 10−5cm, we can do numerical integration of (8) with high precision. Now the

where the fast oscillatory factors are seperated in forms of sin and cos functions.

Mathematica can do that kind of integration with high precision. As an example,
let ¯a2 = 1.24, ¯ρ = 0.07, ¯ν = 10, γ = 1, θ = 0.98 in (8), one may get f (t, x) =
−1.02057 × 10−13, which should vanish exactly due to the basic theorem (ρ > 0, θ <
1). Considering the amplidude of incident light pulse is 1, 10−13 is a very high

accuracy of calculation. Now let ¯ρ = −0.07 and other parameters unchanged, f (t, x)

in (8) is 0.0630255, which is a deﬁnite evidence to show that the basic theorem is

violated indeed when ρ < 0. Because γ = xn0/c, θ = tc/x, f (t, x) may be looked as
a function of γ and θ, h(γ, θ). Let us ﬁx γ = 1, i.e., x = 0.75 × 10−6cm, and θ change

from (-7) to 4, i.e., the time t from −7/n0 to 4/n0, the amplitude of light pulse h(1, θ)
in the medium is shown in Fig.2, where ¯a2 = 1.24, ¯ρ = −0.07, γ = 1, ¯ν = 10(ν =

10 n0). Again when ρ < 0, h(1, θ) does not vanish and the basic theorem is violated.
In Fig.2 even if t < 0, the amplitude h(1, θ) still does not vanish, which means that

before the incident light pulse arrives at the medium, the light in the medium is

already produced. For convenience, we call the light produced in the medium when

θ < 1 as fastlight and that when θ > 1 as normal light. When the basic theorem

4

holds, the fastlight vansishes. Some maximal values of light amplitude near θ = 1

and their corresponding θ values are listed in table 1, where two characteristics are

shown:

(1) The amplitude of fastlight is oscillatory and decays as θ → −∞;

(2) The period for each oscillation for θ less and near 1 are roughly around

θ = 6, which means its frequency is near the characteristic frequency n0 of the
medium (the corresponding period is θ = 2π). This near equality is due to the fact

that the Fourier components of the light pulse having freqencies equal to or near n0
are most gain-assisted when ρ < 0. When θ > 1, the normal light soon oscillates

with the frequency ν of the incident light pulse (corresponding period θ = 0.2π) and

its amplitude is a little bit lager than 1(1.00089). When ¯ν = 1 with other parameters
¯a2 = 1.24, ¯ρ = −0.07, γ = 1 unchanged the two properties (1) and (2) remain, but

the amplitude of the fastlight increases to 6.14 near θ = 1. The amplitude of normal

light inceases to 7.31 with frequency ν = n0.

Model 2: the ρ in (7) depends on frequency n as

ℓ − b < n < ℓ + b

ρ1
ρ2 n ≤ ℓ − b or n ≥ ℓ + b ,

(12)

ρ(n) = 


which is not continuous and therefore µ(n) and the integrand in (6) are not the

analystic functions of n. We still can use numerical calculation to see whether the

basic theorem holds:

(a) ¯a2 = 1.24, ρ1 = −0.07, ρ2 = 0.07, ℓ = 1, b = 0.01, ¯ν = 1, γ = 1. Now light
amplitude in the medium are gain-assisted when (1−b)n0 < n < (1+b)n0 and decays
otherwise. Fastlight with above two properties appears again and its amplitude near

θ = 1 is 3.81, while that of normal light is about 4.5;

(b) ρ1 = 0.02 with other parameters unchanged as in (a). Now light in the
whole frequency range in the medium decays. Still fastlight remains with the two

properties, but its amplitude becomes small (0.0757) near θ = 1.

So we may conclude that if µ(n) in (6) is an analystic function of n with sin-

gularities (such as poles or branch lines) appearing in the upper half plane of n, or

µ(n) is not an analystic function of n at all, the basic theorem in general may not

hold and fastlight appears. The Fourier components of a light pulse now will not

cancel each other in the medium in the space-time region t − x/c < 0. This is why

fastlight appears.

How to measure the velocity of the light pulse when fastlight appears in the

medium? Suppose a light pulse produced in a source at t = 0, propagating a

distance ℓ1 in a vacuum, then going through a medium with thickness ℓ2. Just
after the medium a light pulse detector is put. Usually the fastlight appears in

the medium after the light pulse is produced and the amplitude of the fastlight is

inceasing when the light pulse is approaching to the medium. If the amplitude of

fastlight is able to become large enough to trigger the detector at t = t1, one may
take v = (ℓ1 + ℓ2)/t1 as the velocity of the light pulse propagating from the source
to the detector, which certainly exceeds c.

Although the models proposed above are not completely realistic, we believe that

production of the fastlight and some its properties in the models may remain in a

more realistic model, which is under investigation now.

We would like to thank professors Gu Yi-fan and Dong Fang-xiao for their ben-

eﬁcial discussion.

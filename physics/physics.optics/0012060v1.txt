Anomalous dispersion cannot occur in a transparent passive medium where electromagnetic ra-
diation is being absorbed at all frequencies, as pointed out by Landau and Lifshitz. Here we show,
both theoretically and experimentally, that transparent linear anomalous dispersion can occur when
a gain doublet is present. Therefore, a superluminal light pulse propagation can be observed even
at a negative group velocity through a transparent medium with almost no pulse distortion. Con-
sequently, a negative transit time is experimentally observed resulting in the peak of the incident
light pulse to exit the medium even before entering it. This counterintuitive eﬀect is a direct result
of the rephasing process owing to the wave nature of light and is not at odds with either causality
or Einstein’s theory of special relativity.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a seminal paper, Lord Rayleigh remarked that a
pulse of light travels at the “group velocity” instead of
the phase velocity inside a medium [1].
In subsequent
papers, Lord Rayleigh further developed the theory on
transparency and opacity, and the theory of anomalous
dispersion [2,3]. Anomalous dispersion was ﬁrst stud-
ied for mechanical oscillators [3] and was later applied
by Sommerfeld and Brillouin [4] to light propagating in
absorptive opaque materials. They showed theoretically
that inside an absorption line, the dispersion is anoma-
lous, resulting in a group velocity faster than c, the vac-
uum speed of light. Such an anomalous velocity appears
owing to the wave nature of light [5,6]. .

This however raised diﬃculties with the theory of rela-
tivity which states that no velocity can be higher than c,
the velocity of light in a vacuum. Brillouin pointed out
[4] “Group velocity, as originally deﬁned, became larger
than c or even negative within an absorption band. Such
a contradiction had to be resolved and was extensively
discussed in many meetings about 1910.”

In order to reconcile the superluminal group velocity in
an anomalous dispersion medium with the implied limi-
tation from relativity, Sommerfeld and Brillouin pointed
out that causality only requires the speed of a signal car-
ried by light be limited by c, rather than the light pulse
itself which travels at the group velocity [4]. They further
pointed out that the correct deﬁnition of the speed of a
light signal should be deﬁned as the “frontal velocity,”
instead of the somewhat misleadingly named “signal ve-
locity” deﬁned as the speed of the half-point of the front
edge of a light pulse. A “frontal velocity” marks the ve-
locity of an inﬁnitely sharp step-function-like change in

the light intensity, albeit even in principle such an in-
ﬁnitely sharp change in time requires inﬁnite bandwidth
and thus becomes impractical. It was shown that since
the inﬁnitely sharp “front” contains inﬁnitely large band-
width, a good portion of the power would exceed any
practical resonant and non-resonant (plasma) frequen-
cies to have an eﬀective refractive index of unity. Thus
this portion of the power will propagate exactly at c to
exit the medium at the earliest time and form “precur-
sors” [4]. It was an ingenious argument that resolved the
apparent conﬂict of special relativity and superluminal
group velocities.

More recently, it has been considered [7–11,13–19,21–24]
to use various schemes including the anomalous disper-
sion near an absorption line [8–11], nonlinear [13] and
linear gain lines [14–19,22–24], active plasma medium
[17,21], or in a tunneling barrier [25,26] to observe these
eﬀects. Sometimes it is applied [9–11,25,26] to observe
superluminal propagation of light pulses. Inside an ab-
sorption line, it was shown that a light pulse propagates
at group velocities faster than c and can become negative
with dramatic values of
c/23, 000 [9–12]. However, in
all experiments light pulses experienced either very large
absorption [9,10] or severe reshaping [25] that sometimes
resulted in controversies over the interpretations.

−

In a series of papers [7,18,19,22–26], Chiao and cowork-
ers showed theoretically that anomalous dispersion can
occur inside a transparent material, particularly on the
DC side of a single gain line. It was predicted that by us-
ing a gain doublet [22], it is possible to obtain a transpar-
ent anomalous dispersion region where the group velocity
of a light pulse exceeds c with almost no pulse distortion.
Here we use gain-assisted linear anomalous disper-
sion to demonstrate superluminal light pulse propaga-

tion with a negative group velocity through a transpar-
ent atomic medium [27]. We place two Raman gain peaks
closely to obtain an essentially lossless anomalous disper-
sion region that results in a superluminal group velocity.
The group velocity of a pulse in this region exceeds c and
can even become negative [22,23], while the shape of the
pulse is preserved. We measured a negative group ve-
locity index of ng =
5). Experimentally, a light
±
pulse propagating through the atomic vapor cell exits
from it earlier than propagating through the same dis-
tance in vacuum by a time diﬀerence that is 315 times of
the vacuum light propagation time L/c = 0.2 ns. Thus,
the peak of the pulse exits the cell before it even enters.
This counterintuitive eﬀect is a consequence of the wave
nature of light and can be well explained invoking the
rephasing process in an anomalously dispersive medium.
The observed superluminal light pulse propagation is not
at odds with causality, being a direct consequence of clas-
sical interference between its diﬀerent frequency compo-
nents in an anomalous dispersion region.

II. THEORY OF TRANSPARENT ANOMALOUS
DISPERSION

For all transparent matter at a thermal equilibrium
such that it is absorptive at all frequencies in the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum, the medium’s optical dispersion
is normal [6]. In other words, for transparent media, the
optical refractive index always increases when the fre-
quency of the optical excitation increases. Particularly,
Landau and Lifshitz showed that under the condition

through metal is also slower than c, the vacuum speed of
light.

These conditions are direct results of the Kramers-
Kronig relations. Hence, for media in a passive state
under Eq.(1) where electromagnetic irradiation at all fre-
quencies are transformed into heat and subsequently dis-
sipated, anomalous dispersion and transparency cannot
occur simultaneously in the same frequency region.

However, for media with gain, the general assumption
in Eq.(1) no longer holds.
In a gain medium such as
that of an electronic ampliﬁer (e.g. an operational am-
pliﬁer) or an optical ampliﬁer commonly used for lasers,
the imaginary part of the electric susceptibility χ(ν) can
become negative over a narrow frequency region where
gain occurs. Hence, the general results of the inequal-
ities (2) no longer apply and anomalous dispersion can
happen in a transparent media, resulting in superluminal
group velocities that can even become negative.

A. Classical Theory of Negative Group Velocity

In a transparent medium where absorption is negligi-
ble, the optical dispersion is primarily governed by its
refractive index and the dispersion relation can be writ-
ten:

k(ν) = 2π

n(ν)

ν

where k(ν) is the wave number for the wave component
of frequency ν. The group velocity is hence given by

and in the special case for media with a magnetic perme-
ability µ(ν) = 1, two inequalities hold simultaneously:

where

ng(ν) =

dν

dν

n(ν)

.

and

ng(ν) =

(2)

Here ng is the group velocity index: vg = c/ng, where vg
is the group velocity.

In the case of dielectric media, when an incident light
wave’s frequency is below the bandgap where the media
are transparent, the refractive index n(ν) > 1. Hence,
the group index ng > n > 1, resulting in normal disper-
sion and the group velocity of light pulses slower than
c. On the other hand, in the case of metals when the
incident light’s frequency is higher than the plasma fre-
quency νP , the metal becomes transparent with a refrac-
tive index n(ν) < 1. In this case, the second inequality in
Eq. (2) becomes more strict and results in ng > 1/n > 1.
Therefore, the group velocity of a light pulse propagating

rapidly enough with frequency, the group velocity be-
comes negative. Of course, it is well known that inside an
absorption line, the refractive index takes a steep drop [4]
resulting in an “anomalous dispersion” and consequently
a negative group velocity [9]. However, the associated
heavy absorption which results in opacity makes it diﬃ-
cult to study these eﬀects.

The earlier work of Chiao and coworkers [7,18,22] pre-
dicted that it is possible to study steep anomalous disper-
sion and negative group velocity in a transparent medium
where gain rather than absorption occurs at the interest-
ing frequency regions. It is important to have a transpar-
ent medium where the majority of the electromagnetic
radiation energy is kept in the light ﬁelds rather than
being dissipated inside the medium via absorption.

Let us start by considering a classical Lorentz oscillator
model of the refractive index. The electric displacement
is given by:

D = ε0 E + P = ε0(1 + χ)E = ε0 E(1 + N α),

(6)

where N is the atomic density and α is the atomic po-

ε0N αE can be obtained using a simple Lorentz model.
In order to obtain the dipole polarization p =

for a bound charge with an intrinsic angular frequency
ω0 = 2πν0 and an angular damping rate Γ = 4πγ, we

For a narrow frequency region in the middle between the

Conversely, for gain lines, a negative oscillator strength
1 is assigned [18]. Hence between two closely

For dilute gaseous medium, we obtain from Eq.(12) for
the refractive index n(ν) = n′(ν) + i n′′(ν) = 1 + χ(ν)/2
and the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index
are plotted in Fig.1. It is evident from Fig.1 that a steep
anomalous dispersion region appears without the heavy
absorption present. In fact, a residual gain persists. Fur-
thermore, with the correct choice of experimental param-
eters, the steep drop of refractive index as a function of
frequency can be made a mostly linear one in this region.
Thus a light pulse with a frequency bandwidth within
this narrow linear anomalous dispersion region will expe-
rience almost no change in pulse shape upon propagating
through such a medium.

Now, we consider the propagation of a light pulse of
an arbitrary shape through a transparent anomalous dis-
persing medium of a length L as illustrated in Fig.2. For
a scalar light pulse that is decomposed into its positive
and negative frequency parts:

E(z, t) = E(+)(z, t) + E(−)(z, t),

FIG. 2. Pulse propagation through a medium of a length L
and a group velocity index vg = c/(n + ν dn/dν). Pulse prop-
agation through the same length in vacuum is also shown for

Hence, the intensity of the light pulse as a function of
time measured with a detector (shown in Fig.2), I(L, t),
is related to the incident pulse’s time-dependent intensity
by:

where A is the beam area.

Ordinarily, in a normal dispersion medium, the group
velocity vg < c. Hence, the output intensity of a pulse
propagating through the medium is retarded by the prop-
agation time L/vg, resulting in a delay longer than the
vacuum transit time L/c.
In a transparent anomalous
dispersion medium, the group velocity vg = c/[n +
ν dn/dν] can exceed c provided the anomalous dispersion
is suﬃciently strong such that: n + ν dn/dν < 1. In this
case, the group velocity becomes superluminal: vg > c,
resulting in a “superluminal transit time:” L/vg < L/c,

the vacuum transit time. Hence the output pulse’s time-
varying proﬁle is related to the input pulse by a delay
that is shorter than the vacuum transit time L/c result-
ing in a superluminal propagation of the light pulse.

Furthermore, when the transparent anomalous disper-
sion becomes stronger to yield: n + ν dn/dν = 0, the
group velocity vg = c/[n + ν dn/dν] approaches inﬁnity,
resulting in a “zero transit time”, such that Eq.(18) gives
I(L, t) = I(0, t
L/vg) = I(0, t). In this case, the output
pulse and the input pulse vary the same way in time and
there is no time delay experienced by the pulse propa-
gating through the medium which has a length of L.

Finally, when the transparent anomalous dispersion
becomes very steep such as for the case illustrated in
Fig.1, the dispersive term ν dn/dν which is negative be-

is positive and can becomes very large compared to the
vacuum transit time L/c. This means that the intensity
at the output of the medium of length L, I(L, t), will vary
in time earlier than that of the input pulse I(0, t). Thus
in this case, a “negative transit time” can be observed.
The time diﬀerence between the output pulse and the in-
put pulse in the form of a pulse advancement, is
fold
of the vacuum transit time L/c. Practically, since the
shape of the pulse is not changed, this results in a rather
counterintuitive phenomenon where a certain part of the
light pulse has already exited the medium before the cor-
responding part of the incident light pulse even enters by
times of the vacuum transit

a time diﬀerence that is

This rather counterintuitive eﬀect is a result of the

wave nature of light.

B. Quantum Theory of Atomic Response in
Transparent Anomalous Dispersion

In order to correctly model the electromagnetic re-
sponses of a dilute atomic gaseous medium, one must
compute its dielectric susceptibility using the quantum
mechanical treatment. In this section, we provide a sim-
pliﬁed yet realistic model of a transparent anomalous dis-
persion medium realized using two Raman gain lines in
a Λ-system shown in Fig.3.

In a simpliﬁed Λ-system, two continuous wave (CW)
Raman pump light ﬁelds are present for the creation of
the gain doublet shown in Fig.1. The two Raman pump
ﬁelds are diﬀerent in frequency by a small amount 2∆ν.
For simplicity, we will ﬁrst ignore the Doppler shift and
assume that the atoms are at rest.

We begin by treating the simple case of a single Raman
pump ﬁeld and compute the linear dielectric susceptibil-
ity for the Raman probe ﬁeld. Let us ﬁrst suppose that

Without involving complicated density operator treat-

where the electromagnetic ﬁeld is also quantized, we can

in a Raman scheme as used in the experiment, the ma-
jor factor of the Raman transition broadening is due to
transit time broadening rather than the eﬀective excited
state decay rate: (Ω2

The eﬀects of this modiﬁcation are two fold. First, the

quadratic dependence on 1/(∆0 + ν
an even function which prevents cancellation of the ef-
fect due to Doppler broadening. This is a direct result
of using Raman transitions. Second, for some velocity
groups where the shifted detuning ∆0 + ν

ish. However, for these velocity groups, the Raman pump
beams act like reversed optical pumping which empty
these velocity groups such that G(V0) = 0. This is similar
to the “spectral hole burning” eﬀect commonly know in
laser physics. Furthermore, the atoms reversely pumped
away in these velocity groups act like a broadband weak
absorber that helps to compensate the residual gain as
shown in Fig.1.

To begin, let us refer to Fig.2 and consider a Gaussian

is more complex since power broadening and common

Next, we calculate the pulse advance (negative delay),
∆T , for a Gaussian pulse propagating through an anoma-
lous dispersion medium of length L. Referring the ex-
perimental situation illustrated in Fig.2, a light pulse
propagating through a transparent anomalous dispersion

Finally, we compute the pulse width change factor β.
We notice from Eq.(37) that β depends on the derivative
of the group velocity index ng. From Fig.1, it is appar-
ent that the frequency-dependent change of the real part
of the refractive index n
(ν) is essentially linear in the
narrow frequency region between the two gain lines. It is
the imaginary part, i.e., the gain coeﬃcient that appears
to have a quadratic change as a function of frequency.
Therefore, the majority of the potential change in the
width of an incident pulse will be due to the quadratic
change in the imaginary part of the refractive index. We
obtain using Eq.(30),

When various parameters such as the M factor (linear in

the pulse duration τ is signiﬁcantly decreased, the fac-
tor β will become reasonably diﬀerent from (larger than)
unity. In these cases, β > 1 will result in a narrowing in
the pulse’s temporal width.

In the present experiment, this pulse distortion factor

β is only 1.002.

III. EXPERIMENTS

From the theoretical treatment above, we see that a
variety of parameters have to be taken into considera-
tion in experimentation. From an experimental point of
view, one must satisfy the following requirements. First,
a gain doublet must be obtained for which the anoma-
lous dispersion between the gain lines can become linear
to avoid any pulse distortion. In previous work, excited
state population inversion was considered to obtain gain
[22]. However, spontaneous emission and the short ex-
cited state life time would cause such gain doublets to be
very diﬃcult to sustain. It is important to have a steady
state gain with a lifetime longer than the pulse duration
τ to avoid transient eﬀects and the associated compli-
cations. Second, the medium must be transparent since
opaque anomalous dispersion has been long known and
has resulted in controversies in terms of interpretations.
While ideally the dispersion shown in Fig.1 is transpar-
ent, residual absorption and the associated loss are often
present and cannot be simply discarded in experimental
situations. Third, in order to show superluminal light
pulse propagation in a linear regime, one must employ
a very weak light pulse for which the photon number is
far less than the atomic number in order to avoid Raman
gain saturation. Fourth, in order to achieve a reason-
able accuracy in the measurement, a system should be
designed to demonstrate a negative group velocity.
In
this case, the pulse advancement under conventional ex-
perimental situation will be substantially large compared
with commonly obtained accuracy (about 1ns). A num-
ber of other experimental conditions also have to be con-
sidered such as atomic density, polarization decay time,
etc. and they will be discussed in the following sections
as well.

A. Experimental Setup

The experiment is performed using an atomic Cesium
(Cs) vapor cell at 30oC and the main setup is shown in
Fig.4. The cesium atoms are conﬁned in a 6-cm-long
Pyrex glass cell coated with paraﬃn for the purpose of
maintaining atomic ground-state spin polarization. The
atomic cell is placed inside a magnetic shield made of
a thin layer of high-µ metal material inside which the
Earth magnetic ﬁeld is reduced to sub-milli-Gauss level.
A Helmholtz coil (not shown in Fig.4) produces a uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld inside the magnetic shield parallel
to the propagation direction of all optical beams. This
uniform ﬁeld is approximately 1 Gauss serving the pur-
pose of deﬁning a quantization axis for optical pumping.
Inside the magnetic shield, the air temperature is con-
trolled using a heater servo system in order to control

man pump beams are right-hand polarized (σ+) and a
weak Raman probe beam is left-hand polarized (σ
). Us-
ing 3 acousto-optical modulators (AOM’s), the frequency
diﬀerence of the two Raman pump beams can be tuned
continuously over a few MHz while the probe beam can
also be tuned in frequency and can be operated in both
CW or pulsed mode. The typical carrier frequency of
the AOM’s is 80 MHz and the linewidth is about 20 kHz.
A residual optical beam that is shifted in frequency by
80 MHz generated from the same AOM which modulates
the probe beam is also available for the refractive index
measurement.

B. Experimental Methods and Results

First, we operate the Raman probe beam in a tunable
CW mode to measure the gain and refractive index of
the atomic system as a function of the probe frequency
detuning. Fig.5 shows the measured gain coeﬃcient and
the refractive index. In order to obtain the gain coeﬃ-
cient, we ﬁrst measure the intensity of the transmitted
probe beam as a function of probe frequency. We then
extract the gain coeﬃcient.

the temperature of the Cesium cell. During data acquisi-
tion, this control system is turned oﬀ to avoid any stray
magnetic ﬁeld. Having good thermal insulation, the tem-
perature of the atomic cell remains the same during the
data acquisition time.

transitions from both the 6S1/2, F = 4 and F = 3 hyper-
ﬁne ground states to the 6P1/2 excited state. Both laser
beams are initially linear polarized and are turned into
left-hand polarization (σ
) using a quarter-wave plate
placed before the atomic cell. Inside the vapor cell, Ce-
sium atoms collide with the paraﬃn-coated glass walls,
the atoms change their velocities inside the Doppler pro-
ﬁle. However, their ground state spin polarizations are
not changed during collisions. Hence, all atoms inside the
entire Doppler broadening proﬁle are optically pumped
into the ground state
quickly. The
mean dephasing time of the ground state spin polariza-
tion of Cesium atoms in a paraﬃn coated cell is of order
a fraction of a second.

do this, we tune the diode laser outside of the Doppler

comes:

since the phase shift here φof f = 0. Hence, we di-

φon(ν) = 2πn(ν) L/λ. The result is shown in Fig.5. The
superimposed curve is obtained from Eq.(30) using pa-
rameters obtained from the gain measurement. From
Fig.5, we readily see that a negative change of ∆n= -
1.8x10−6 in the refractive index occurs over a narrow
probe frequency range of ∆ν= 1.9 MHz between the two
gain lines. Using the expression of the group-velocity

Next, a pulsed Raman probe beam is employed to ob-
serve the superluminal propagation. A near Gaussian
probe pulse with a 2.4 µsec FWHM is generated by ap-
plying a biased sinusoidal electronic signal to the probe
beam A/O modulator. The repetition rate is 50 kHz. A
portion of the pulsed probe beam is divided at a beam-
splitter before the atomic cell and aligned onto photo-
diode D1 as a reference. Because the total number of
atoms in the probe volume limits the maximum net en-
ergy gain of the probe pulse, we use a very weak probe
1µW) in order to avoid saturation and hence
beam (
to optimize the anomalous dispersion. A high sensitivity
avalanche photodiode, reverse-biased below breakdown,
serves as detector D2 to measure the weak probe pulse

≈

that propagates through the atomic cell. The photoelec-
tric current produced by detector D2 is converted to a
voltage signal using a 500-Ω load resistor and recorded
by a digitizing oscilloscope using a synchronized output
signal from the pulse generator as the trigger. Pulses
from detector D1 are also recorded.

In order to measure the pulse propagation time, we
ﬁrst tune the diode laser that produces the Raman pump
and probe beams far oﬀ-resonance from the 852 nm
Cesium D2 lines (by 2.5 GHz) to measure the time-
dependent probe-pulse intensity. When the laser is
placed far oﬀ-resonance, the atoms have no eﬀect and
the probe pulse propagates at the speed c inside the cell.
We then tune the diode laser back to within the Doppler
absorption proﬁle and lock it on its side. Using the same
synchronized pulse generator output signal as the trig-
ger, we record the time-dependent probe pulse intensity
measured by detector D2. We verify that no systematic
drift is present by tuning the laser oﬀ-resonance again by
the same amount and record the probe pulse signal; the
two oﬀ-resonance pulses are identical to within less than
1 ns. Probe pulses both on and oﬀ-resonance are shown
in Fig.6 (average of approximately 1000 pulses).

Using a least square ﬁtting procedure, we obtain a
pulse advancement shift of 63 (

with the 0.2 nsec propagation time for light to tra-
verse the 6-cm length of the atomic cell in vacuum, the
63 nsec advancement gives an eﬀective group index of
ng = 315(

ferred from the refractive index measurement. The pulses
measured with detector D1 are also recorded in the se-
quence of the oﬀ-, on-, oﬀ-resonance pulse propagation
measurements and are found to be identical to within

We note here that the measured superluminal pulse

Finally, we measure the pulse delay/advancement ∆T
as a function of the pulse carrier frequency ν. Fig.9 shows
the measurement results. For several values of the car-
rier frequency ν, the pulse gain is measured. We further
record the pulse forms for the laser frequency tuned oﬀ-
and on- resonance. Using the measured pulse gain, we
obtain the gain coeﬃcient and ﬁt the data using Eq.(30).
Using the ﬁtting parameters, we compute the theoretical
value of refractive index and group delay/advancement
plotted also in Fig.9. The large error bar for the pulse
delay measurement near the gain lines are due to the
rapid change in group velocity index and gain, causing
severe pulse shape distortions. The simple model based

11

on a Lorentz oscillator is in good agreement with the
experimental results.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

As remarked by Lord Rayleigh [1], the group veloc-
ity of a light pulse is the result of interference between
its various frequency components. Here we note that
the measured negative and superluminal group veloc-
ity of a light pulse propagating through a transparent
anomalous dispersion medium is due to the physical eﬀect
of “rephasing.” Speciﬁcally, inside an anomalous disper-
sion medium, a longer wavelength (redder) component
of a light pulse has a slower phase velocity, contrary to
the case of a normal dispersion medium. Conversely, a
shorter wavelength component (bluer) has a faster phase
velocity. Inside a medium of refractive index n, the ef-
fective wavelength of a light ray is modiﬁed: λ′ = λ /n,
where λ is the vacuum wavelength. Therefore, in a suﬃ-
ciently strong anomalous dispersion medium, the redder
incident ray will have a shorter wavelength and hence be-
comes a bluer ray, while an incident bluer ray will have
a longer wavelength to become a redder ray. This results
in an unusual situation where the phases of the diﬀerent
frequency components of a pulse become aligned at the
exit surface of the medium earlier than even in the case
of the same pulse propagating through the same distance
in a vacuum.

This highly unusual circumstance was poorly under-
stood because it only occured in absorption lines previ-
ously. Furthermore, inside an opaque medium, the ma-
jority of the incident light energy is absorbed and sub-
sequently dissipated by the medium making it diﬃcult
to deﬁne the energy velocity of light. In the present ex-
periment, an anomalous dispersion region is created in a
transparent medium. Hence it becomes possible to speak
about the energy velocity of a light pulse [34,35].

Here we note that the physical mechanism that governs
the observed superluminal light propagation has been
traditionally viewed as “virtual” reshaping [7,25]. In the
past, such superluminal light pulse propagation has been
widely viewed as the result of the ampliﬁcation of the
pulse’s front edge and the absorption of its tail, inspite it
had been repeatedly pointed out that such reshaping is
actually a “virtual process” [7,25]. In the present exper-
iment, the 2.4µ sec (FWHM) probe pulse has only a 160
kHz bandwidth (FWHM) that is much narrower than the
2.7 MHz separation of the two gain lines and the probe
pulse is placed in the middle of these gain lines spectrally.
Hence, the probe pulse contains essentially no spectral
components that are resonant with the Raman gain lines
to be ampliﬁed. Therefore, the argument that the probe
pulse is advanced by ampliﬁcation of its front edge does
not apply. Furthermore, the average time an atom stays
inside the volume of the Raman probe beam is < 1µ sec,

shorter than the 2.4µsec FWHM of the pulse. Hence,
even if the atoms are amplifying the probe pulse, both
the leading and the trailing edges would be ampliﬁed as
both edges interact with atoms in the same state. This
is not consistent with the experiment. Hence it is worth
emphasizing that the “reshaping” of the pulse can be only
viewed as “virtual reshaping” [7,25] aimed at providing
an intuitive understanding. Strictly speaking, the super-
luminal light propagation observed here is the result only
of the anomalous dispersion region created with the as-
sistance of two nearby Raman gain resonances. In other
words, it is largely due to the rapid anomalous change of
the refractive index as is shown in Eq.(39) rather than
the gain. When the gain coeﬃcient becomes large, its ef-
fect appears as the compression of the pulse, as indicated
by Eq.(37) and (40). We further stress that the observed
superluminal light propagation is a result of the wave
nature of light [5]. It can be understood using the clas-
sical theory of wave propagation in an anomalous dis-
persion region where interference between diﬀerent fre-
quency components produces this rather counterintuitive
eﬀect.

domain (FDTD) method to model wire media is developed and validated.
Sub-wavelength imaging properties of the ﬁnite wire medium slabs are
examined. It is demonstrated that the slab with its thickness equal to an
integer number of half-wavelengths is capable of transporting images with
sub-wavelength resolution from one interface of the slab to another. It is
also shown that the operation of such transmission devices is not sensitive
to their transverse dimensions, which can be made even comparable to the
wavelength. In this case, the edge diffractions are negligible and do not
disturb the image formation.

Introduction

The conventional imaging systems operate only with propagating harmonics emitted by a
source, since the spatial harmonics carrying sub-wavelength information (evanescent waves)
exhibit exponential decay in free space. This is why the resolution of common imaging sys-
tems is restricted by the diffraction limit: The details smaller than the wavelength can not be
resolved. A realization of imaging with sub-wavelength resolution may enable breakthrough in
creation of future imaging devices at microwave, sub-millimeter, terahertz, infrared and optical
frequency ranges, and can lead to signiﬁcant progress of emerging technologies. For example,
the sub-wavelength imaging can be used in optical industry for enlargement of the capacity of
optical drives (DVD), in antenna industry and in near ﬁeld microscopy for improvement of near
ﬁeld scanners, in medicine for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and terahertz imaging, etc.
An idea to overcome the diffraction limit was ﬁrst suggested by Sir John Pendry in his sem-
inal paper [1]. It was proposed to use left-handed materials, isotropic media with both negative
permittivity and permeability [2]. A planar slab of such a material provides an opportunity for
imaging with sub-wavelength resolution due to the effects of negative refraction and ampliﬁ-
cation of evanescent waves. However, it is still problematic to manufacture left-handed media
since it requires to artiﬁcially create negative permeability. Currently available designs of left-
handed media (at both microwave and optical frequency ranges) are very lossy that restrict and
even prevent their sub-wavelength imaging applications. There is an alternative approach for
sub-wavelength imaging which does not involve either left-handed media or effects of negative
refraction and ampliﬁcation of evanescent waves. This new regime was recently suggested in
the paper [3] where it was named canalization. The idea is that both propagating and evanescent
harmonics of a source can be transformed into the propagating waves inside a slab of certain
materials. Then, these propagating modes are capable of transporting sub-wavelength images
from one interface of the slab to another. The source has to be placed very close to the front
interface of the slab in order to avoid deterioration of the sub-wavelength details in the free
space. A reﬂection from the slab can be minimized by appropriate choice of its thickness. If the
slab is tuned for Fabry-Perot resonance then the reﬂection from its interface is negligibly small
for all angles of incidence including complex ones. This allows to avoid harmful interactions
between the source and the slab which can disturb the image. An appropriate material for op-
eration in the canalization regime should have a ﬂat isofrequency contour, or in other words it
should support waves traveling in a certain direction with the ﬁxed phase velocity for any trans-
verse wave vector. The materials which fulﬁl this requirement are available at both microwave
[3, 4, 5] and optical [6] frequency ranges. The most interesting opportunity was suggested in
[5] where the wire medium, a regular array of parallel metallic wires [7] was used. Originally,

it was expected that the transmission devices formed by the wire media would operate only at
microwave frequencies where the most of the metals behave as ideal conductors. However, re-
cently it has been proposed to use the same structures for sub-wavelength imaging at terahertz
and infrared frequency bands where metals reveal their plasma-like properties [8].

In the present paper we study the performance of sub-wavelength imaging by transmission
devices formed by the wire medium at microwave frequencies. The ﬁnite-sized planar slabs of
wire medium excited by sub-wavelength sources are modeled using the ﬁnite-difference time-
domain (FDTD) method. The wire medium is treated as a bulky material other than an actual
periodic array of wires in [5].

2. Spatial dispersion in the wire medium

The wire medium is an artiﬁcial material formed by parallel perfect- conducting wires arranged
into a rectangular lattice (see Fig. 1). This medium has been known as an artiﬁcial dielectric

with plasma-like properties at microwave frequencies for a long time [9, 10, 11], but only
recently it was shown that the wire medium has strong spatial dispersion [7]. In other words,
the wire medium is a non-local material and in the spectral domain it can not be described
using only frequency dependent permittivity tensor. The permittivity tensor of the wire medium
depends also on the wave vector. In this paper we will use the following expression for the
permittivity tensor derived in [7]:

where the x-axis is oriented along wires, qx is the x-component of the wave vector q, k =
w /c is the wave number of the free space, c is the speed of light, and kp is the wave number
corresponding to the plasma frequency of the wire medium. The wave number kp depends on
the lattice periods a and b, and on the radius of wires r [12]:

The expression (1) for the permittivity tensor of the wire medium is valid if the wires are thin
as compared to the lattice periods (when the polarization across the wires is negligibly small as
compared to the longitudinal polarization) and if the lattice periods are much smaller than the
wavelength (when the wire medium can be homogenized).

The wire medium supports three different types of modes, in contrast to the usual uniaxial

dielectrics which only support two types of modes: ordinary and extraordinary:

• TE modes (ordinary modes, transverse electric ﬁeld with respect to the wires), the waves
which are polarized across the wires and do not induce any currents along the wires. In
the thin wire approximation one can regard these as the modes which travel in the free
space and do not interact with the wires.

• TM modes (extraordinary modes, transverse magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the wires), the
waves which correspond to nonzero currents in the wires and nonzero electric ﬁeld along
the wires. At the frequencies below the plasma frequency, these waves are evanescent.

• TEM modes (transmission-line modes, transverse electric and magnetic ﬁeld with respect
to the wires), the waves with nonzero currents in the wires, but with zero electric ﬁeld
along the wires. These modes travel with the speed of light along the wires (qx =
k) and
can have any wave vector in the transverse direction. Effectively, these waves correspond
to the modes of a multi-conductor transmission line formed by the wires, and enable us
to use wire medium for realization of the canalization regime.

±

The presence of TEM (transmission-line) mode provides an evidence of the strong spatial
dispersion in the wire media. Usually, effects of the spatial dispersion can be observed in any
periodical structure at the frequencies corresponding to the spatial resonances when the wave-
length in the free space is comparable with the period of the structure, as in usual photonic and
electromagnetic crystals, or when the wavelength in the crystal becomes comparable with the
period of the structure due to the resonant behavior of inclusions, like in the case of resonant ar-
tiﬁcial dielectrics or photonic crystals made from self-resonant inclusions. The wire medium is
a unique material where the spatial dispersion is observed at very low frequencies and without
any resonant effects.

3. Spatially dispersive FDTD method for numerical modeling of the wire medium

The FDTD method for numerical solutions of Maxwell’s equations was ﬁrst proposed by Yee in
1966 [13]. The method is based on an iterative process which allows to obtain the electromag-
netic ﬁelds throughout the computational domain at a certain time step in terms of the ﬁelds at
the previous time steps using a set of updating equations [14]. The typical discretization scheme
involves forming a dual-electric-magnetic ﬁeld grid with electric and magnetic cells spatially
and temporally offset from each other. The main advantages of the FDTD method are its sim-
plicity, effectiveness and accuracy as well as the capability of modeling frequency dispersive
and anisotropic materials. The FDTD method has been widely used for modeling of various
structures which include components formed by materials with complex electromagnetic prop-
erties: frequency dispersive and anisotropic dielectrics and magnetics, bi-anisotropic media,
ferrites, nonlinear materials, left-handed media and photonic crystals, etc. The simulations of
materials with complex inner geometries can be performed either by modeling actual struc-
tures or through the effective medium approach (if applicable). The second possibility allows
to dramatically decrease complexity of calculations and save computational time.

In spite of the considerable number of complex electromagnetic media modeled using the
FDTD method, still there is a certain incompleteness in consideration. Being focused on the

frequency dispersion effects, researchers have practically ignored the spatial dispersion. Ac-
cording to our knowledge, so far no FDTD modeling of spatially dispersive materials has been
done. Probably, the lack of attention to the spatial dispersion effects is caused by two following
reasons. The ﬁrst reason is that it is widely assumed that the spatial dispersion effects are usu-
ally quite weak and can be neglected. However, this is not true: there is a number of complex
materials in which the spatial dispersion effects are strong and play dominant roles in determi-
nation of their electromagnetic properties. One example of such materials, the wire medium,
is considered in this paper. The second possible reason why the spatial dispersion effects did
not attract much attention of researchers is a complexity in description of the spatial dispersion
effects. The analytical expressions which describe spatial dispersion for particular materials
are generally not available in contrast to the numerous analytical models which describe the
frequency dispersion effects. The wire medium is an exception form this rule. The spatial dis-
persion effects in this material can be described by simple analytical formula (1).

In the present paper, the wire medium is modeled as a frequency and spatially dispersive
dielectric with permittivity tensor (1). Both frequency and spatial dispersion effects are taken
into account in FDTD modeling using an auxiliary differential equation method. At the spectral
(w -q) domain, the relation between the electric ﬂux density D and the electric ﬁeld intensity E
in the wire medium is following:

D(w

, q) = e 0e (w

, q)E(w

where e 0 is permittivity of the free space and e (w

In this paper we will use the updating Eq. (13) for modeling of uniaxial Drude material (fre-
quency dispersive material with no spatial dispersion) which can be treated as conventional and
incorrect description of the wire medium [9, 10, 11], in order to demonstrate the signiﬁcance
of taking into account the spatial dispersion effects in the modeling of the wire medium.

We would like to note that in the present paper we consider only so-called one-dimensional
wire media, the lattices of parallel ideally conducting wires oriented in one direction as in Fig. 1,
which can be described following [7] by permittivity tensor (1) with one spatially dispersive
component. Actually, there are also two- and three-dimensional wire media [18, 19, 20] con-
sisting of two or three orthogonal non-connected lattices of parallel ideally conducting wires,
which can be described by permittivity tensors with two or three spatially dispersive compo-
nents of the same form as in (1), respectively. These two- and three-dimensional wire media
can be easily modeled using the spatially dispersive FDTD method as introduced above: the
updating equation (12) has to be applied in two or three directions, respectively.

4. Excitation of the wire medium slab by a point magnetic source

We have implemented the spatially dispersive FDTD method in two-dimensional simulations in
order to study the wave propagation through the wire medium. The computation domain is inﬁ-
y plane (see Fig. 2). A ten-cell Berenger’s
nite in z-direction and has a rectangular shape in x

−

perfectly matched layer (PML) [21] is used to truncate the computation domain. The FDTD
cell size is D x = D y = l /200 and the time step according to the Courant stability condition
t = D x/2c. The polarization is transverse magnetic (TM) with respect to the orientation
[14] is D

y plane and the magnetic ﬁeld is along z-axis. The wire medium has a rect-

y plane (see Fig. 2). The wires are oriented along
angular shape with dimensions d
x-axis. The wave number corresponding to the plasma frequency of the wire medium is chosen
to be four times larger than the wave number of the free space (kp = 4k). The thickness of the
slab d has to be an integer number of half-wavelengths in order to implement the canalization
regime [3, 5]. A point magnetic source radiating sinusoidal signal with free space wavelength
l
is placed at the distance d from the front interface of the wire medium slab. As illustrated
in Fig. 2, the front interface of the imaging device is treated as the source plane, and the back
interface as the image plane, respectively.

fact that the waves in the wire medium travel in the ﬁxed direction (along the wires) with the
speed of light, in contrast to the free space case where the waves travel with the speed of light in
arbitrary direction. The point source creates a cylindrical wavefront in the free space (see Fig.
3) since the waves are allowed to travel in all directions with the same speed. However, as soon
as the cylindrical wave enters the wire medium, the form of wavefront changes dramatically
(see Fig. 3): the wavefront becomes conical. The waves travel with speed of light along the
surface of the wire medium in the free space and excites transmission line modes of the wire
medium which travel in the orthogonal direction (along the wires) with the same speed, that
is why the form of the wavefront happens to be conical. Note that the front part of the cone
contains sub-wavelength information of the source and as soon as the cone reaches the back
interface of the slab one can state that the sub-wavelength image is formed. Thus, we conclude
that the formation of images happens with the speed of light and all spatial harmonics from
the spectrum of the source reaches the image plane at the same time. This fact illustrates the
advantage of the canalization principle of sub-wavelength imaging over the regime based on
negative refraction and ampliﬁcation of evanescent waves, where the pumping of the growing
evanescent waves takes very long and the sub-wavelength information corresponding to the
different spatial harmonics appears at the image plane with signiﬁcant delay.

4.2. Power ﬂow
In the second simulation, we have placed a point magnetic source at the l /10 distance from
1l slab of wire medium. The power ﬂow diagram in the steady-state regime for this
the 0.5l
case is presented in Fig. 4. One can see that in the close vicinity of the interfaces the power
ﬂow changes direction because of the evanescent extraordinary modes of the wire medium and
inside the wire medium the energy transfer happens only along direction of wires with the
help of transmission line modes. Also, it is noteworthy that no harmful diffractions from the
corners of the slab are observed. This can be explained by the fact that the waves in the wire
medium travel and transfer energy only along x-axis and no waves travel along y-axis. That

corners are visible. Due to the absence of diffraction effects it is not mandatory to have the
transverse size w of the slab to be signiﬁcantly larger than the wavelength in order to provide
functionality of the transmission device, in contrast to the case of conventional lenses. The
transverse dimensions of the transmission device can be practically arbitrary. For example, in
the present paper we use one- and two-wavelength wide slabs which demonstrate good sub-
wavelength imaging performance.

4.3. Distributions of electric and magnetic ﬁelds
In the next simulation, see Fig. 5, we have kept l /2 thickness of the slab and l /10 distance
between source and the wire medium slab, but increased transverse size of the slab up to 2l
.
Fig. 5 shows the distributions of electric and magnetic ﬁelds after the steady state is reached.

non-zero x-component of electrical ﬁeld is present inside the wire medium slab only in the close
vicinity of the interfaces. This can be easily explained since only the extraordinary modes of
the wire medium have non-zero electric ﬁeld along the wires, but these modes in the present
case are evanescent and decay with distance. That is why the x-component of electrical ﬁeld
vanishes in the center of the slab. Inside the wire medium slab, only transmission line modes are
present and thus, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have only y- and z-components, respectively,
see Figs. 5.b and 5.c. In accordance to the canalization principle, the transmission line modes
deliver images from the front interface to the back one. This is why the absolute values of the
ﬁelds are the same at the front and back interfaces, see Fig. 6. However, the ﬁelds in the image
plane appear in out of phase with respect to the ﬁelds in the source plane since the thickness of
the slab is l /2.

4.4. Effect of the slab thickness

The images produced by transmission devices operating in the canalization regime exactly re-
peat the source distributions if the thickness of the structure is equal to even number of half-
wavelengths and appear out of phase if the thickness is equal to odd number of half-wavelengths
[3]. In order to demonstrate the case when the image appears in phase with the source we have
chosen a wire medium slab with the dimension of 2l
. Other parameters are the same as
in the previous case. Figs. 7.a, b and c show the distributions of electric and magnetic ﬁeld in
the simulation domain for this case and it is clearly seen that the ﬁelds at the back interface of
the slab are the same as at the front interface. Additionally, the distribution of magnetic ﬁeld
in the plane y = l
is plotted in Fig. 7.d in order to demonstrate that the ﬁeld inside of the wire
medium has harmonic dependence with the period l along the direction of wires. Using this
illustration and the fact of magnetic ﬁeld continuity at the interface between free space and

the wire medium, it becomes possible to explain the canalization principle for sub-wavelength
imaging: The ﬁeld at the back interface of the slab repeats the distribution at the front interface
because the total thickness of the slab is equal to integer numbers of half-wavelength and at
such a distance any harmonic dependence with period l

repeats its initial absolute value.

5. Effects of spatial dispersion in modeling of the wire medium

The wire medium is a unique artiﬁcial material which possesses strong spatial dispersion ef-
fects. It is quite hard to compare properties of this material with media without spatial disper-
sion, however it is possible to reveal certain similarities and differences. For example, if the
spatial dispersion effects are neglected in (1) then one deals with uniaxial Drude material with
permittivity tensor

e = e (w )xx + yy + zz,

e (w ) = 1

Such a model can be treated as an old and incorrect description of the wire medium [9, 10, 11].
We have replaced the wire medium in simulations corresponding to Fig. 5 by a local uniaxial
Drude material with permittivity tensor (14). All other parameters of the structure (kp = 4k, h =
, d = l /2, see Fig. 2) were kept unchanged. The FDTD simulation was performed
l /10, w = 2l
using the updating equation (13). The distributions of the ﬁelds in the steady-state regime are
presented in Fig. 8. One can readily notice strong differences between this ﬁgure and Fig. 5

corresponding to the case of the wire medium: The waves inside of the uniaxial Drude material
travel not precisely along the anisotropy axis, and thus, they suffer numerous reﬂections from
the edges and corners of the slab. The interference pattern caused by the multiple-reﬂected
waves distorts ﬁeld distributions in both source and image planes, see Fig. 10.b. This example
shows that it is extremely important to take into account the spatial dispersion in modeling of
the wire media.

Actually, the wire medium behaves similar to the uniaxial material with permittivity tensor

e = ¥ xx + yy + zz.

(15)

This can be explained by the fact that the component e (w
wire medium (1) happens to be inﬁnite for transmission line modes with qx =

Fig. 9. Distributions of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the steady state for a slab of the

source located at l /10 distance from the front interface.

It ﬁrst appears that Figs. 9 and 5 seem to be identical. However, more precise comparison
immediately reveals signiﬁcant differences: in the case of the uniaxial material with inﬁnite
permittivity along anisotropy axis, x-component of electric ﬁeld is zero everywhere inside this
material, but in the case of wire medium there are regions near the front and back interfaces of
the slab where this component is non-zero. In other words, the model (15) allows to describe
transmission line modes of the wire medium, but it does not take into account extraordinary
modes of the wire medium. The presence of extraordinary modes in the wire medium makes
distributions of the ﬁelds in the source and image plane slightly different from those in the case
of the uniaxial material with inﬁnite permittivity along the anisotropy axis, see Fig. 10.a.

The distributions of magnetic ﬁeld in the source and image planes for the simulations con-
sidered in this section are plotted in Fig. 10 for comparison. The slabs of wire medium and
uniaxial material with inﬁnite permittivity along the anisotropy axis demonstrate nearly perfect
imaging: The distributions of the ﬁeld in the source and image planes are practically identical.
The difference between the distributions can be explained by the fact that high-order spatial
harmonics experience non-zero reﬂections from the wire medium slab as it is shown in [22]. In
the case of local uniaxial Drude material, see Fig. 10, these reﬂections are signiﬁcantly higher,
and strong ripples caused by interference of the waves reﬂected from the edges and corners of
the slab encumber proper imaging operation of the device.

6. Sub-wavelength imaging by the wire medium slabs

In previous sections we have shown good imaging performance of the wire medium slabs.
However, we were not able to demonstrate the sub-wavelength imaging capability of such de-
vices since the point source excitations were used in simulations. In order to investigate such
capability, we have performed additional simulations with more complicated (sub-wavelength)
sources. We have placed three equally spaced magnetic point sources at l /20 distance from
2l slab of wire medium. The distance between sources is l /20
the front interface of a 0.5l
and the central source is excited in out of phase with respect to the neighboring sources. The
proposed three-source conﬁguration creates distribution with two strong maxima at the front
interface of the wire medium slab and the distance between these maxima is about l /10, see
Fig. 11. Results of the spatially dispersive FDTD simulation for excitation of the wire medium

domain, ratio between plasma frequency and operating frequency, FDTD cell size and time step
remain the same as in previous sections. The distribution of magnetic ﬁeld in the image plane is

solved by the device, that conﬁrms the sub-wavelength imaging capability of the wire medium
lenses. For more details about resolution of such imaging devices see theoretical investigations
in [22].

7. Conclusion

The spatially dispersive FDTD method has been developed for efﬁcient modeling of the wave
propagation in the wire medium using the effective medium approach. The auxiliary differ-
ential equation method is used in order to take into account both the spatial and frequency
dispersion of the wire medium. The ﬂat sub-wavelength lenses formed by the wire medium are
chosen for the validation of developed spatially dispersive FDTD formulations. Numerical sim-
ulations verify the sub-wavelength imaging capability of these structures. The results conﬁrm
that the slabs of the wire medium operate in the canalization regime as transmission devices and
demonstrate that this regime is not sensitive to the transverse dimensions of these structures.

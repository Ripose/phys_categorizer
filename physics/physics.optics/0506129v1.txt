Abstract

Under certain circumstances, the group velocity in a homogenized composite medium
(HCM) can exceed the group velocity in its component material phases. We explore
this phenomenon for a uniaxial dielectric HCM comprising isotropic component ma-
terial phases distributed as oriented spheroidal particles. The theoretical approach is
based upon the Bruggeman homogenization formalism. Enhancement in group velocity
in the HCM with respect to the component material phases is shown to be sensitively
dependent upon the shape of the component spheroids and their alignment relative to
the direction of propagation.

Keywords: Group–velocity enhancement, Bruggeman homogenization formalism, uniaxial

1 Introduction

The process of homogenization involves the combination of two (or more) component material
phases to produce a single, eﬀectively homogeneous, composite medium [1, 2, 3]. Typically,
the constitutive properties of the component material phases are relatively simple as com-
pared with those of the homogenized composite medium (HCM). Through homogenization,
novel and potentially useful material properties may be realized [4, 5]. Many examples of

material properties being extended — or indeed entirely new material properties being real-
ized — as a result of homogenization can be found within the regimes of linear and nonlinear
electromagnetics [6].

An interesting result concerns the electromagnetic group velocity in HCMs. Under cer-
tain circumstances, the group velocity in an HCM can exceed the group velocities in its
component material phases. This issue was investigated for isotropic dielectric mediums
using a volume–weighted sum to estimate the HCM permittivity [7]. A more generally ap-
plicable approach based on the well–established Bruggeman homogenization formalism was
reported recently [8]. In these studies, an enhancement in group velocity is demonstrated
through homogenizing two component material phases, one of which is characterized by a
relatively large permittivity and relatively small frequency–dispersive term as compared with
the other component material phase.

The directional properties of group–velocity enhancement are explored in this communi-
cation. Speciﬁcally, we consider a uniaxial dielectric HCM which develops from the homog-
enization of a random assembly of oriented spheroidal particles. The component material
phases are themselves electromagnetically isotropic. Our theoretical analysis is founded upon
the Bruggeman homogenization formalism [9].

2 Homogenization

Let us consider the homogenization of a composite medium containing two component ma-
terial phases, labelled as a and b. Both component material phases are taken to be isotropic
dielectric mediums: ǫa and ǫb denote the permittivity scalars of phases a and b, respectively.
In order to focus in particular upon the phenomenon of enhancement of group velocity,
without being distracted by the complications arising from dielectric loss, the component
R. The component material
material phases are assumed to be nondissipative; i.e., ǫa,b
phases are envisioned as random distributions of identically oriented, spheroidal particles.
The spheroidal shape — which is taken to be the same for all particles of phases a and b — is
parameterized via the shape dyadic

where I is the identity 3
rotational symmetry. The spheroid’s surface is described by the vector

3 dyadic and the unit vector ˆc is parallel to the spheroid’s axis of

×

with ˆr being the radial unit vector from the spheroid’s centroid and speciﬁed by the spherical
polar coordinates θ and φ. The linear dimensions of the spheroid, as determined by the
parameter η, are assumed to be small relative to the electromagnetic wavelength(s).

3 Group velocity

Let us consider a wavepacket which is a superposition of planewaves with phasors

The group velocity vg of the wavepacket is conventionally deﬁned in terms of the gradient
of the angular frequency ω with respect to k [14]; i.e.,

In order to calculate the group velocity in the uniaxial dielectric HCM (3), denoted as
vBr
g , we exploit the corresponding planewave dispersion relation as follows. The combination

4 Numerical studies

Without loss of generality, let us choose the axis of rotational symmetry of the component
spheroids to lie along the x axis, i.e., ˆc = ˆx. We consider wavevectors lying in the xy plane,
oriented at an angle θ to the x axis. That is, we take

Let us explore numerically the enhancement in group velocity that can arise through
homogenization, paying special attention to directional eﬀects induced by the shape of the
component spheroidal particles. In particular, we choose the component material phase a
to have a relatively high permittivity ǫa and a relatively small frequency–dispersion term
dǫa/dω, compared with the component material phase b. As representative constitutive
parameter values, we set: ǫa = 30ǫ0, (dǫa/dω)
=
12ǫ0/ωo, where ǫ0 is the permittivity of free space.

|ω=ωo = 6ǫ0/ωo, ǫb = 1.2ǫ0 and

dǫb/dω

ω=ωo

In Figure 1, the Bruggeman estimates of the HCM permittivity parameters ǫBr

k and ǫBr

are plotted as functions of volume fraction fa, for the range of values of ρ = Uk/U⊥ shown

k becomes
an increasingly nonlinear function of fa as ρ decreases, whereas ǫBr
⊥ becomes an increasingly
nonlinear function of fa as ρ increases.

In Figure 2, the magnitude of the group velocity vBr

of a wavepacket in the chosen
HCM is plotted against volume fraction. The group velocities are calculated with k = kex for
θ = 0◦, 30◦, 60◦ and 90◦. The corresponding graphs for 180◦
θ are the same as those for θ.
Since the ordinary wavevector kor = kex at θ = 0◦, the ordinary group velocities for any θ are
identical to those provided in Figure 2(a) wherein the results for θ = 0◦ are presented. The
group velocity magnitudes for the component material phases a and b are va
g = 0.166c and
vb
g = 0.152c, respectively (as is conﬁrmed in Figure 2 by the group velocity values at fa = 1
and fa = 0, respectively), where c = 1/√ǫ0µ0. Hence, for this particular homogenization

It may be discerned from Figure 2(a) that group–velocity enhancement occurs over an
increasingly large range of fa values as ρ decreases. Furthermore, the degree of enhancement
at ρ = 20 is much smaller than it is at ρ = 0.05.

characteristics at low and high values of ρ are approximately the reverse of their respective
characteristics at θ = 0◦. That is, group–velocity enhancement occurs over a wide range of
fa values for high values of ρ at θ = 90◦, but there is no enhancement in group velocity at
low values of ρ.

Clearly therefore, enhancement of group velocity is maximum in a direction parallel to the
longest semi–axis of the spheroidal particles, which can be prolate (ρ < 1) or oblate (ρ > 1).
For spherical particles (ρ = 1), group–velocity enhancement is direction–independent, and
we recover the results of the predecessor study [8].

5 Concluding remarks

The enhancement in group velocity brought about by homogenization is sensitively depen-
dent upon directional properties. Both the shape of the component spheroidal particles,
and their orientation relative to the direction of propagation, strongly inﬂuence the group–
velocity enhancement.

The homogenization scenario presented here deals with the conceptualization of a uniaxial
HCM as arising from identically oriented spheroidal particles of isotropic component material
phases. The homogenization of two uniaxial dielectric component phases distributed as
spherical particles is mathematically equivalent, provided that the distinguished axes of the
component material phases have the same orientation [15].

Figure 2: The magnitude of the HCM group velocity vBr
, as estimated using the
Bruggeman formalism, plotted against volume fraction fa. The group velocity is normal-
ized with respect to c = 1/√ǫ0µ0. Constitutive parameters of component material phases:
ǫa = 30ǫ0, (dǫa/dω)
= 12ǫ0/ωo. A key for
the ρ = Uk/U⊥ values is given in Table 1. Shading indicates the region of group–velocity
enhancement. (a) Extraordinary wavevector angle θ = 0◦.

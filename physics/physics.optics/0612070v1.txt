We propose the use of an optically trapped, dye doped polystyrene microsphere for spatial probing of the
refractive index at any position in a ﬂuid. We demonstrate the use of the dye embedded in the microsphere
as an internal broadband excitation source, thus eliminating the need for a tunable excitation source. We
measured the full width at half maximum of the TE and TM resonances, and their frequency spacing as
a function of the refractive index of the immersion ﬂuid. From these relations we obtained an absolute
−4 in local refractive index, even when the exact size of the microsphere was not a priori
sensitivity of 5 × 10
known.

Microspheres can act as high Q resonators in the op-
tical regime1, 2 and can store electromagnetic waves by
repeated total internal reﬂection. Constructive interfer-
ence results in an enhanced internal ﬁeld which is called a
whispering gallery mode (WGM). Because of the evanes-
cent interaction between the WGM and the surround-
ing medium the WGM’s resonance frequency is sensitive
to changes in the refractive index of the sphere’s sur-
roundings. This sensitivity makes microspheres an use-
ful tool in sensory applications. Recently Hanumegowda
et al. demonstrated the use of microspheres in refracto-
metric sensing.3 Moreover Vollmer et al.4 and White et
al.5 demonstrated protein detection using microspheres.
In all these studies3–5 narrowband light from a tunable
diode laser was evanescently coupled to the microsphere
via an optical ﬁber. Spatial mapping of the refractive in-
dex was not possible because the microsphere could not
be freely moved through the sample.

In this letter we demonstrate the use of a dye-doped
polystyrene microsphere as a refractometric sensor. The
polystyrene microsphere was trapped with optical tweez-
ers, by which it could be positioned anywhere within the
ﬂuid. It can therefore be used to sense the refractive in-
dex in spatially inhomogeneous media, for example near
interfaces or in mixing ﬂows. In this system we did not
need a tunable laser to excite WGMs, instead we used
the dye embedded in the microsphere itself as a broad-
band excitation source. The absolute frequency of the
WGM, which was used to probe the refractive index in
previous studies,3–5 is very sensitive to the size of the
sphere. Microspheres synthesized in bulk always have
a considerable size polydispersity, and therefore a wide
distribution of absolute resonance frequencies. Measure-
ments of the absolute resonance frequency of a particle
that has not been individually calibrated does not pro-
vide information about the refractive information of the
medium. In contrast, we show that both the full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of the emission peaks and the
frequency spacing between adjacent transverse electric

(TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes are sensitive
and robust probes of the refractive index of the sphere’s
surroundings. We show that a calibration of the individ-
ual microspheres is not needed in this case.

The FWHM of a WGM is determined by the loss upon
total internal reﬂection at the curved surface of the mi-
crosphere. These losses depend on the mode number l
and the refractive index contrast m = m0/mI, where
m0 and mI are the refractive indices of the immersion
medium and the microsphere respectively. The FWHM
of a WGM can be expressed as7

where µ = ν/x, with ν = l + 1/2.

The frequency spacing between a TE and TM mode
of the same mode number is due to a diﬀerence in phase
shift of s and p polarized light upon reﬂection at the
sphere surface. The absolute frequency at which a WGM
occurs is deﬁned as the real part of the pole of the scat-
tering coeﬃcient,6 and we calculated the frequency spac-
ing by numerically calculating the poles for TE and TM
modes.

In our experiments we used a suspension of dye-doped
polystyrene microspheres in water (G1000, Duke Scien-
tiﬁc Corporation). The manufacturer speciﬁed a mean
radius of 5.0 ± 0.3 µm (standard deviation). We mea-
sured the size distribution of 24 microspheres and found
a mean radius of 5.3 µm with a maximum deviation of
only 0.5 %. Taking into account a conservative error
margin, we assumed that the size of any sphere we trap

elaboration of Mie theory (EMT) developed by Chew et
al. describing the emission of dipoles inside a spherical
cavity.8, 9 The only parameters were the refractive index
of the sphere mI , the refractive index of the immersion
medium m0, and the sphere radius a. The refractive
index of the sphere was measured to be mI = 1.586 - i ·
1.5 × 10−5.10 The refractive index of the immersion ﬂuid
m0 was measured with the refractometer. The only free
parameter in our system was the radius of the sphere a.
The theoretical emission spectra were corrected for the
response function of the spectrograph.

In Fig. 1 we show the emission spectra obtained from
a single dye doped polystyrene microsphere immersed in
(a) water (m0 = 1.3325) and (b) a mixture of water and
ethylene glycol (m0 = 1.3978). Sharp peaks were ob-
served in the spectrum due to WGMs. The dashed lines
show the radiation rates (normalized to the rate in bulk
polystyrene) as predicted by EMT for (a) a = 5.33 µm,
and (b) a = 5.319 µm. Comparing the spectra in (a)
and (b) we observed that the decrease in refractive index
contrast induced an increase in FWHM of the WGMs
and a decrease in the spacing between the adjacent TE
and TM modes.

As we have shown in Fig. 1 it is possible to obtain
m0 and a by ﬁtting the experimental spectra with a the-
oretical emission spectrum. However, the initial values
for the parameters must be chosen rather carefully. The
same parameters can be obtained in a more straightfor-
ward way by comparing only the FWHM and the TE96-
TM96 mode spacing to predictions from EMT. Both the
FWHM and the mode spacing were determined by ﬁt-
ting a Voigt proﬁle11 to an individual WGM in the mea-
sured emission spectrum. The Voigt proﬁle models the
convolution of the Lorentzian width of the resonance
and the Gaussian response function of the spectrograph.
To accurately ﬁt the resonance shape, we subtracted a
quadratic ﬁt of the background intensity.

In Fig. 2 we show the Lorentzian FWHM as a function
of m0 for the TE96 mode. The size of the error bars was
taken from the error in the Lorentzian width of the ﬁts.
The large error at m0 = 1.41 was due to a low signal to
noise ratio resulting from a low refractive index contrast.
The theoretical FWHMs (solid lines) were calculated for
the biggest and smallest spheres in the measured size
distribution, and were calculated from Eq. (1). It can
be seen that the FWHM is very insensitive to the sphere
size as the calculated curves are almost identical.

In Fig. 3 we show the experimental TE96-TM96 mode
spacing, obtained from the central frequency of the ﬁtted
Voigt line shapes. The error bars are the uncertainty in
the central frequency of the Lorentzian ﬁts. The theoret-
ical mode spacing is again calculated for the biggest and
smallest spheres in the measured size distribution, and
the result is shown as a grey area. It can be seen that
the TE96-TM96 mode spacing is slightly more sensitive
to sphere size than the FWHM (Fig.2).

Figs. 2 and 3 show that our measurements correspond
very well to the theoretical model, even though the size
of the trapped microsphere varies between measurements

was 5.30 ± 0.05 µm. The microspheres were doped with
2% dye which emits in the green part of the spectrum
(λ = 480 − 540 nm). The sample holder was a borosil-
icate glass capillary with inner dimensions 0.1 × 2 × 40
mm3.

With optical tweezers operating at 1064 nm we held a
single microsphere far away from any surface. The ex-
citation light source was a continuous wave Argon laser
(Spectra Physics Satellite 2016) emitting at 488 nm with
a maximum output power of 30 mW, attenuated to 500
µW on the sample. The laser light was slightly defo-
cused on the sphere, so that the whole sphere was illu-
minated. The emission of the dye was collected through
a water immersed objective (NA 1.2) and detected by an
ICCD (Princeton Instruments ICCD 576), connected to
a spectrograph (Oriel Instruments, MS257) which has a
Gaussian response function with a width of 4.5 cm−1.

Tuning of the refractive index of the immersion ﬂuid
m0 was achieved by mixing water with ethylene glycol
(m0 = 1.4317 at 293 K and 589 nm) in various fractions.
Ethylene glycol does not chemically aﬀect polystyrene
and is miscible with water in all volume fractions. Re-
fractive indices of the mixtures were measured with an
Abbe refractometer type 1T which is temperature stabi-
lized and has an accuracy of 2 ×10−4 in refractive index.
We compared our experimental emission spectra to an

due to size polydispersity. The polydispersity in sphere
size introduced an inaccuracy in the theoretical values
for the FWHM and TE-TM mode spacing of < 1 %.

One can use either the FWHM or the mode spacing to
measure the refractive index of the medium. However,
the sensitivity and robustness of these methods is not the
same. The TE96-TM96 mode spacing is nearly linear in
our refractive index range with a slope of 385 cm−1 per
refractive index unit. An accuracy in width of 2 cm−1
was easily achieved for refractive indices below 1.39, re-
sulting in a sensitivity of nearly 5 × 10−3 in refractive
index. When measuring the FWHM of a WGM the sen-
sitivity of the sensor is higher, and varies throughout our
refractive index domain. From the slope of the curve in
Fig. 2 we obtained a sensitivity of 5 × 10−4 in refractive
index around m0 = 1.41. The FWHM method leads to
the most precise measurements in the ideal case, how-
ever, this method is very sensitive to contamination at
the sphere surface. The mode spacing is a more robust
method and may therefore be used when contamination
cannot be excluded.

In conclusion we demonstrated a spatial probe for
the refractive index comprising an optically trapped dye
doped microsphere. The use of optical tweezers gives us
the freedom to measure the refractive index anywhere
in the ﬂuid. This freedom allows for spatial mapping
of refractive index gradients or inhomogeneities caused
by, for example, ﬂow in microﬂuidic devices or chemical
processes. The emission of an embedded dye acts as the
internal source to excite the WGMs in the microsphere.
We measured the FWHM and the frequency spacing be-
tween TE and TM modes. The measured values show ex-
cellent agreement with theoretical predictions, conﬁrm-
ing the suitability of the system for spatial probing of the
refractive index without the need for individual calibra-
tion. Very recently, Kn¨oner et al.12 have demonstrated
a method to determine the refractive index of a trapped
microsphere by measuring the trapping force. Their and

our methods are complimentary and could easily be com-
bined, providing a versatile system for sensory applica-
tions.

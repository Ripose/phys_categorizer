We calculate the eﬀect of a Dirac point (a conical singularity in the band structure) on the trans-
mission of monochromatic radiation through a photonic crystal. The transmission as a function of
frequency has an extremum at the Dirac point, depending on the transparencies of the interfaces
with free space. The extremal transmission T0 = Γ0W/L is inversely proportional to the longi-
tudinal dimension L of the crystal (for L larger than the lattice constant and smaller than the
transverse dimension W ). The interface transparencies aﬀect the proportionality constant Γ0, and
they determine whether the extremum is a minimum or a maximum, but they do not aﬀect the
“pseudo-diﬀusive” 1/L dependence of T0.

INTRODUCTION

dence of I on ω and L. Our conclusion is that

In a two-dimensional photonic crystal with inversion
symmetry the band gap may become vanishingly small
at corners of the Brillouin zone, where two bands touch
as a pair of cones. Such a conical singularity is also re-
ferred to as a Dirac point, because the two-dimensional
Dirac equation has the same conical dispersion relation.
In a seminal work [1], Raghu and Haldane investigated
the eﬀects of broken inversion symmetry and broken time
reversal symmetry on the Dirac point of an inﬁnite pho-
tonic crystal. Here we consider the transmission of ra-
diation through an ideal but ﬁnite crystal, embedded in
free space.

As we will show, the proximity to the Dirac point is as-
sociated with an unusual scaling of the transmitted pho-
ton current I with the length L of the photonic crys-
tal. We assume that L is large compared to the lattice
constant a but small compared to the transverse dimen-
sion W of the crystal. For a true band gap, I would be
suppressed exponentially with increasing L when the fre-
quency ω lies in the gap. Instead, we ﬁnd that at the
Dirac point I ∝ 1/L. The 1/L-scaling is reminiscent of
diﬀusion through a disordered medium, but here it ap-
pears in the absence of any disorder inside the photonic
crystal.

Such “pseudo-diﬀusive” scaling was discovered in Refs.
[2, 3] for electrical conduction through graphene (a two-
dimensional carbon lattice with a Dirac point in the spec-
trum). Both the electronic and optical problems are gov-
erned by the same Dirac equation inside the medium, but
the coupling to the outside is diﬀerent. In the electronic
problem, the coupling can become nearly ideal for elec-
trical contacts made out of heavily doped graphene [2, 3],
or by suitably matching the Fermi energy in metallic con-
tacts [4, 5]. An analogous freedom does not exist in the
optical case.

I/I0 = Γ0W/L

(1.1)

at the Dirac point, with I0 the incident current per mode
and Γ0 an eﬀective interface transparency. The proper-
ties of the interfaces determine the proportionality con-
stant Γ0, and they also determine whether I as a function
of ω has a minimum or a maximum at the Dirac point,
but they leave the 1/L-scaling unaﬀected.

In Sec. II we formulate the wave equations inside and
outside the medium. The Helmholtz equation in free
space is matched to the Dirac equation inside the pho-
tonic crystal by means of an interface matrix in Sec. III.
This matrix could be calculated numerically, for a spe-
ciﬁc model for the termination of the crystal, but to arrive
at general results we work with the general form of the
interface matrix (constrained by the requirement of cur-
rent conservation). The mode dependent transmission
probability through the crystal is derived in Sec. IV. It
depends on a pair of interface parameters for each of the
two interfaces. In Sec. V we then show that the extremal
transmission at the Dirac point scales ∝ 1/L regardless
of the values of these parameters. We conclude in Sec.
VI with suggestions for experiments.

II. WAVE EQUATIONS

We consider a two-dimensional photonic crystal con-
sisting of a triangular or honeycomb lattice in the x-y
plane formed by cylindrical air-ﬁlled holes along the z-
axis in a dielectric medium (see Fig. 1). The crystal has
a width W along the y-direction and a length L along the
x-direction, both dimensions being large compared to the
lattice constant a. Monochromatic radiation (frequency
ω) is incident on the plane x = 0, with the electric ﬁeld
E(x, y)eiωt polarized along the z-axis.

The major part of our analysis is therefore devoted to
the question how nonideal interfaces aﬀect the depen-

In the free space outside of the photonic crystal (x <
0 and x > L) the Maxwell equations reduce to the

photonic crystal (top) and dispersion relation of the doublet

distinguish the two sets of equivalent zone corners, centered
at Kp and K ′

the zone corners are the equal-frequency contours at a fre-
quency ω just above the frequency ωD of the Dirac point.
Left panels: Equal-frequency contour in free space (top) and
corresponding dispersion relation (bottom). A plane wave in
free space with kx close to k0 (arrows in the upper left panel)
excites Bloch waves in the photonic crystal with k close to
K1 and K2 (arrows in the upper right panel), as dictated by
conservation of ky and ω (dotted horizontal lines).

The frequency ωD and velocity vD in the Dirac equa-
tion depend on the strength of the periodic dielectric
modulation, tending to ωD = c′|Kp| = c′|K ′
p| = 4πc′/3a
and vD = c′/2 in the limit of weak modulation. (The
speed of light c′ in the homogeneous dielectric is smaller
than the free space value c.)

Eq. (2.3) may be written more compactly as

− ivD(∇ · σ)Ψ = δωΨ, δω ≡ ω − ωD,

(2.4)

in terms of the spinor Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2) and the vector of
Pauli matrices σ = (σx, σy). In the same notation, the
velocity operator for the Dirac equation is vDσ. The
mean photon number ﬂux jD in the x-direction is there-
fore given by

jD = vDΨ∗σxΨ = vD(Ψ∗

1Ψ2 + Ψ∗

2Ψ1).

(2.5)

The termination of the photonic crystal

in the y-
direction introduces boundary conditions at the edges
y = 0 and y = W which depend on the details of the
edges, for example on edges being of zigzag, armchair,
or other type. For a wide and short crystal, W ≫ L,
these details become irrelevant and we may use periodic
boundary conditions [Ψ(x, 0) = Ψ(x, W )] for simplicity.

Bloch states at one of the corners of the hexagonal ﬁrst
Brillouin zone.

As explained by Raghu and Haldane [1, 6], the modes
at the six zone corners Kp, K ′
p (p = 1, 2, 3), which are
degenerate for a homogeneous dielectric, are split by the
periodic dielectric modulation into a pair of doublets at
frequency ωD and a pair of singlets at a diﬀerent fre-
quency. The ﬁrst doublet and singlet have wave vectors
at the ﬁrst set of equivalent corners Kp, while the second
doublet and singlet are at K ′
p. Each doublet mixes and
splits linearly forming a Dirac point as the wave vector
is shifted by δk from a zone corner. The Dirac equa-
tion (2.3) gives the envelope ﬁeld ∝ eiδk·r of one of these
doublets.

III. WAVE MATCHING

The excitation of modes near a Dirac point has been
discussed by Notomi [7], in terms of a ﬁgure similar to
Fig. 2. Because the y-component of the wave vector is
conserved across the boundary at x = 0, the doublet
near K1 = (Kx, Ky) or K2 = (−Kx, Ky) can only be
excited if the incident radiation has a wave vector k =
(kx, ky) with ky near Ky. The conservation of ky holds
up to translation by a reciprocal lattice vector. We will
consider here the case of |k| < |Kp|, where no coupling to
K3 is allowed. The actual radius of the equal frequency
contour in the free space at ω = ωD will depend on a
particular photonic crystal realization.

The incident plane waves Eincident = E0eik·r in free
space that excite Bloch waves at a frequency δω = ω−ωD
have ky = Ky[1 + O(δω/ωD)] and kx = k0[1 + O(δω/ωD)]
with

k0 =

(ωD/c)2 − K 2
y .

q

(3.1)

For δω ≪ ωD we may therefore write the incident wave
in the form

Eincident(x, y) = E+(x, y)eik0x+iKyy,

(3.2)

with E+ a slowly varying function. Similarly, the re-
ﬂected wave will have ky ≈ Ky and kx ≈ −k0, so that we
may write it as

Ereﬂected(x, y) = E−(x, y)e−ik0x+iKyy,

(3.3)

with E− slowly varying.

1, K ′

The orientation of the Brillouin zone shown in Fig. 2
corresponds to a zigzag edge of the triangular lattice at
x = 0. For this orientation only one of the two inequiva-
lent doublets is excited for a given ky. (The other doublet
at K ′
2 is excited for −ky.) A 90◦ rotation of the Bril-
louin zone would correspond to an armchair edge. Then
a linear combination of the two inequivalent doublets is
excited near ky = 0. For simplicity, we will restrict our-
selves here to the case shown in the ﬁgure of separately
excitable doublets.

While the conservation of the wave vector component
parallel to the boundary determines which modes in the
photonic crystal are excited, it does not determine with
what strength. For that purpose we need to match the
solutions of the Helmholtz and Dirac equations at x =
0. The matching should preserve the ﬂux through the
boundary, so it is convenient to write the ﬂux in the
same form at both sides of the boundary.

The photon number ﬂux (2.2) for the Helmholtz equa-
tion may be written in the same form as the ﬂux (2.5)
for the Dirac equation, by

jH = vH E ∗σxE,

vH =

ε0c2k0
4¯hω2 , E =

E+ + E−
E+ − E−(cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(3.4a)

(3.4b)

3

(In the prefactor k0 we have neglected corrections of order
δω/ωD.) Flux conservation then requires

vH E ∗σxE = vDΨ∗σxΨ, at x = 0.

(3.5)

The matching condition has the general form [8]

Ψ = (vH /vD)1/2M E, at x = 0.

(3.6)

The ﬂux conservation condition (3.5) implies that the
transfer matrix M should satisfy a generalized unitarity
condition,

Eq. (3.7) restricts M to a three-parameter form

M −1 = σxM †σx.

M = eγσz eβσy eiασx

(3.7)

(3.8)

(ignoring an irrelevant scalar phase factor). The real pa-
rameters α, β, γ depend on details of the boundary at
the scale of the lattice constant — they can not be deter-
mined from the Helmholtz or Dirac equations (the latter
only holds on length scales ≫ a).

We now show that the value of α becomes irrelevant
close to the Dirac point. The incident and reﬂected waves
have spinors

Eincident = E0

, Ereﬂected = rE0

(3.9)

1
1(cid:19)
(cid:18)

1
−1(cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

with r the reﬂection coeﬃcient. Both spinors are eigen-
vectors of σx, hence the action of eiασx on E is simply a
phase factor:

M Eincident = eγσz eβσy eiαEincident,
M Ereﬂected = eγσz eβσy e−iαEreﬂected.

(3.10)

There is no need to determine the phase factor e±iα, since
it has no eﬀect on the reﬂection probability |r|2.

A similar reasoning applies at the boundary x = L,

where the matching condition reads

Ψ = (vH /vD)1/2M ′E, at x = L.

(3.11)

Flux conservation requires that M ′ = eγ
σx ,
with real parameters α′, β′, γ′. The value of α′ is again
irrelevant close to the Dirac point, because the spinor of

We consider the case W ≫ L of a wide and short crys-
tal, when we may use periodic boundary conditions at
y = 0, W for the Bloch waves Ψ ∝ eiδk·r. The transverse
wave vector δky is then discretized at δky = 2πn/W ≡
qn, with mode index n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, . . .. We seek the
transmission amplitude tn of the n-th mode.

We ﬁrst determine the transfer matrix Mn(x, 0) of the
n-th mode Φn(x)eiqn y through the photonic crystal, de-
ﬁned by

Φn(x) = Mn(x, 0)Φn(0).

a reﬂection symmetry. For a photonic crystal that has an

are solutions at the same frequency. This implies for the

the photonic crystal close to the Dirac point corresponds
to a narrow range δφ ≃ a/L ≪ 1 of angles of incidence φ

in agreement with Refs. [2, 3]. Eq. (5.2) shows that, re-
gardless of the transparency of the interfaces at x = 0
and x = L, the photon current at the Dirac point is in-
versely proportional to the separation L of the interfaces
(as long as a ≪ L ≪ W ).

The 1/L-scaling of the photon current applies to a fre-
quency interval |δω| <
∼ vD/L around the Dirac frequency
ωD. For |δω| ≫ vD/L the photon current approaches the
L-independent value

with rapid oscillations around this limiting value. The
eﬀective interface transmittance Γ is a rather complicated
function of the interface parameters β, β′, γ, γ′. It is still
somewhat smaller than unity even for maximal coupling
of the photonic crystal to free space (Γ = π/4 for β =
γ = 0).

While several experiments [9, 10] have studied two-
dimensional photonic crystals with a honeycomb or tri-
angular lattice, the emphasis has been on the frequency
range where the band structure has a true gap, rather
than on frequencies near the Dirac point. Recent ex-
periments on electronic conduction near the Dirac point
of graphene have shown that this singularity in the band
structure oﬀers a qualitatively new transport regime [11].
Here we have explored the simplest optical analogue,
the pseudo-diﬀusive transmission extremum at the Dirac
point of a photonic crystal. We believe that photonic
crystals oﬀer a particularly clean and controlled way to
test this prediction experimentally. The experimental
test in the electronic case is severely hindered by the
diﬃculty to maintain a homogeneous electron density
throughout the system [12]. No such diﬃculty exists in
a photonic crystal.

If this experimental test is successful, there are other
unusual eﬀects at the Dirac point waiting to be observed.
For example, disorder has been predicted to increase —
rather than decrease — the transmission at the Dirac
point [13, 14, 15]. Photonic crystals could provide an
ideal testing ground for these theories.

The existence of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of light waves by subwavelength
slits in metal ﬁlms [for example, see T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667 (1998) and H.J.
Lezec et al., Science, 297, 820 (2002)] leads to the basic question: Can a light pulse be enhanced
and simultaneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit? To address this question,
the spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of an ultrashort (femtosecond) wave-packet diﬀracted by
a subwavelength (nanometer-size) slit was analyzed by using the conventional approach based on
the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution of Maxwell’s equations. The results show that a light pulse can be
enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at
the nm- and fs-scales. Possible applications in nanophotonics are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade nanostructured optical elements based on scattering of light waves by subwavelength-size metal ob-
jects, such as particles and screen holes, have been investigated intensively. The most impressive features of the optical
elements are resonant enhancement and spatial localization of optical ﬁelds by the excitation of electron waves in the
metal (for example, see the studies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37).
Recently some nanostructures, namely a single subwavelength slit, a grating with subwavevelength slits, and a sub-
wavelength slit surrounded by parallel deep and narrow grooves attracted a particular attention of researchers. The
study of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of waves in close proximity to a single subwavelength slit
acting as a microscope probe1,2,3 was connected with developing near-ﬁeld scanning microwave and optical micro-
scopes with subwavelength resolution4,5,6,7. The resonant transmission of light by a grating with subwavelength slits
or a subwavelength slit surrounded by grooves is an important eﬀect for nanophotonics8,9,10,11. The transmissivity,
on the resonance, can be orders of magnitude greater than out of the resonance. It was understood that the enhance-
ment eﬀect has a two-fold origin: First, the ﬁeld increases due to a pure geometrical reason, the coupling of incident
plane waves with waveguide mode resonances located in the slit, and further enhancement arises due to excitation
of coupled surface plasmon polaritons localized on both surfaces of the slit (grating)10,11,12. A dominant mechanism
responsible for the extraordinary transmission is the resonant excitation of the waveguide mode in the slit giving a
Fabry-Perot like behaviour11. In addition to the extraordinary transmission, a series of parallel grooves surrounding
a nanometer-size slit can produce a micrometer-size beam that spreads to an angle of only few degrees9. The light
collimation, in this case, is achieved by the excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons in the grooves12. At
appropriate conditions, a single subwavelength slit ﬂanked by a ﬁnite array of grooves can act as a ”lens” focusing
light13. It should be noted that the diﬀractive spreading of a beam can be reduced also by using a structured aperture
or an eﬀective nanolens formed by self-similar linear chain of metal nanospheres14,15.

New aspects of the problem of resonantly enhanced transmission and collimation of light are revealed when the
nanostructures are illuminated by an ultra-short (femtosecond) light pulse16,17,18,19,20. For instance, in the study 16,
the unique possibility of concentrating the energy of an ultrafast excitation of an ”engineered” or a random nanosystem
in a small part of the whole system by means of phase modulation of the exciting fs-pulse was predicted. The study 17
theoretically demonstrated the feasibility of nm-scale localization and distortion-free transmission of fs visible pulses
by a single metal slit, and further suggested the feasibility of simultaneous super resolution in space and time of the
near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The quasi-diﬀraction-free optics based on transmission of pulses by a
subwavelength nano-slit has been suggested to extend the operation principle of a 2D NSOM to the ”not-too-distant”
0.5 wavelength)18. Some interesting eﬀects, namely the pulse delay and long living resonant
ﬁeld regime (up to
excitations of electromagnetic ﬁelds in the resonant-transition gratings were recently described in the studies19,20.

The great interest to resonant enhanced transmission, spatial localization (collimation) of continuous waves and
light pulses by subwavelength metal slits leads to the basic question: Can a light pulse be enhanced and simultaneously
localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit? If the ﬁeld enhancement can be achieved together with nm-scale

spatial and fs-scale temporal localizations, this could greatly increase the potentials of the nanoslit systems in high-
resolution applications, especially in near-ﬁeld scanning microscopy and spectroscopy. In the present article we test
whether the resonant enhancement could only be obtained at the expense of the spatial and temporal broadening of
a light wavepacket. To address this question, the spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of an ultrashort (fs) pulse
diﬀracted by a subwavelength (nanosized) slit in a thick metal ﬁlm of perfect conductivity will be analyzed by using
the conventional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution of Maxwell’s equations. In short, we ﬁrst will
summarize the theoretical development of Neerhoﬀ and Mur (Section II) and the model will then be used to calculate
the spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of the transmitted pulse (wavepacket) under various regimes of the near-ﬁeld
diﬀraction (Section III). We will show that a light pulse can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously
localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales. The implications of the results for diﬀraction-
unlimited near- and far-ﬁeld optics will then be discussed. In Section IV we summarize the results and present the
conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

An adequate description of the transmission of light through a subwavelength nano-sized slit in a thick metal ﬁlm
requires solution of Maxwell’s equations with complicated boundary conditions. The light-slit interaction problem
even for a continuous wave can be solved only by extended two-dimensional (x, z) numerical computations. The
three-dimensional (x, z, t) character of the pulse-slit interaction makes the numerical analysis even more diﬃcult.
Let us consider the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of an ultrashort pulse (wave-packet) by a subwavelength slit in a thick
metal screen of perfect conductivity by using the conventional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution
of Maxwell’s equations. Before presenting a treatment of the problem for a wave-packet, we brieﬂy describe the
Neerhoﬀ and Mur formulation1,3 for a continuous wave (a Fourier ω-component of a wavepacket). The transmission
of a plane continuous wave through a slit (waveguide) of width 2a in a screen of thickness b is considered. The
perfectly conducting nonmagnetic screen placed in vacuum is illuminated by a normally incident plane wave under
TM polarization (magnetic-ﬁeld vector parallel to the slit), as shown in Fig. 1. The magnetic ﬁeld of the wave is
assumed to be time harmonic and constant in the y direction:

The electric ﬁeld of the wave (1) is found from the scalar ﬁeld U (x, z) using Maxwell’s equations:

~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x, z)exp(

iωt)~ey.

Notice that the restrictions in Eq. 1 reduce the diﬀraction problem to one involving a single scalar ﬁeld U (x, z) in two
dimensions. The ﬁeld is represented by Uj(x, z) (j=1,2,3 in each of the three regions I, II and III). The ﬁeld satisﬁes
the Helmholtz equation:

where j = 1, 2, 3. In region I, the ﬁeld U1(x, z) is decomposed into three components:

U1(x, z) = U i(x, z) + U r(x, z) + U d(x, z),

each of which satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation. U i represents the incident ﬁeld, which is assumed to be a plane wave
of unit amplitude:

U i(x, z) = exp(

ik1z).

U d describes the diﬀracted ﬁeld in region I due to the presence of the slit. With the above set of equations and
standard boundary conditions for a perfectly conducting screen, a unique solution exists for the diﬀraction problem.
To ﬁnd the ﬁeld, the 2-dimensional Green’s theorem is applied with one function given by U (x, z) and the other by a
conventional Green’s function:

where (x, z) refers to a ﬁeld point of interest; x′, z′ are integration variables, j = 1, 2, 3. Since Uj satisﬁes the Helmholtz
equation, Green’s theorem reduces to

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the diﬀracted pulse are found by using the expressions (1-32) for each Fourier
ω-component of the wave-packet (34). This algorithm is implemented numerically by using the discrete Fast Fourier-
Transform (FFT) instead of the integral (34). The spectral interval [ωmin, ωmax] and the sampling points ωi are
optimized by matching the FFT result to the original function (33).

The above presented approach deals with the incident waves having TM polarization. This polarization is considered
for the following reasons. According to the theory of waveguides, the vectorial wave equations for this polarization
can be reduced to one scalar equation describing the magnetic ﬁeld H of TM modes. The electric component E of
these modes is found using the ﬁeld H and Maxwell’s equations. The reduction simpliﬁes the diﬀraction problem to
one involving a single scalar ﬁeld in only two dimensions. The TM scalar equation for the component H is decoupled
from the similar scalar equation describing the ﬁeld E of TE (transverse electric) modes. Hence, the formalism
works analogously for TE polarization exchanging the E and H ﬁelds. Moreover, in the case of perfectly conducting
nonmagnetic screen placed in vacuum considered in the present paper, the symmetry of wave equations indicates that
large transmission coeﬃcients (enhancement eﬀect) do exist at the same experimental conditions for the TM and TE
polarizations.

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we test whether a light pulse can be resonantly enhanced and simultaneously localized in space and
time by a subwavelength nano-sized metal slit. To address this question, the spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of
the transmitted pulse under various regimes of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction is analyzed numerically. The electric ~E and
magnetic ~H ﬁelds of the transmitted pulse in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone are computed by solving the equations (1-
32) for each Fourier ω-component of the wave-packet (34). The amplitude of a FFT ω-component of the wave-packet
transmitted through the slit depends on the wavelength λ = 2πc/ω. Owing to the dispersion, the Fourier spectra
of the transmitted wave-packet changes leading to modiﬁcation of the pulse width and duration. The dispersion
of a continuous wave is usually described by the normalized transmission coeﬃcient Tcw(λ), which is calculated by
integrating the normalized energy ﬂux Sz/Si

z over the slit width1,3:

where Si
z is the energy ﬂux of the incident wave of unit amplitude; Sz is the transmitted ﬂux. Equation 35, which
includes the evanescent modes that decay in the far zone, deﬁnes the transmission coeﬃcient in the near-ﬁeld zone.
In order to establish guidelines for the results of our numerical analysis, we computed the transmission coeﬃcient
Tcw(λ, a, b) for a continuous wave (Fourier ω-component) as a function of screen thickness b and/or wavelength λ
for diﬀerent values of slit width 2a. Throughout the computations, the magnitude of the incident magnetic ﬁeld is
assumed to be equal to 1. We consider a perfectly conducting nonmagnetic screen placed in vacuum (ǫ1 = ǫ2 = ǫ3 = 1)
As an example, the dependence Tcw = Tcw(b) computed for the wavelength λ = 800 nm and the slit width 2a = 25 nm
is shown in Fig. 2. The dispersion Tcw = Tcw(λ) for 2a = 25 nm and diﬀerent values of the screen thickness b is
λ/2πa
presented in Fig. 3. In Fig. 2, we note the transmission resonances of λ/2 periodicity with the peak heights Tcw≈
at the resonances. Notice that the resonance positions and the peak heights are in agreement with the results2,3. The
resonance peaks appear with spacing of 400 nm, but at values somewhat smaller than 400, 800, 1200 nm, etc. In
order to better understand the shift of the resonant wavelengths from the naively expected values we have derived a
simple analytical formula (36) for the transmission coeﬃcient Tcw = Tcw(a, b, λ) of a narrow slit (the fundamental
mode only is retained):

Figure 2 compares the transmission coeﬃcients Tcw = Tcw(b) calculated by using the formula (36) with the values
given by the numerical solution of the equations (24-27, 35) and the values obtained from the evaluation of (39). We
notice that the results are practically undistinguishable. Analysis of the denominator of the formula (36) indicates
that for 2a/λ small enough, the transmission Tcw = Tcw(b) will exhibit the maximums around wavelengths
λ/2.
The shifts of the resonance wavelengths from the value λ/2 are caused by the wavelength dependent terms in the
denominator of Eq. 36.

The dispersion Tcw = Tcw(λ) presented in Fig. 3 indicates the wave-slit interaction behaviour, which is similar to
those of a Fabry-Perot resonator. The transmission resonance peaks, however, have a systematic shift towards longer
wavelengths. Analysis of the denominator of the formula (36) indicates that for 2a/λ small enough, the transmission
Tcw = Tcw(λ) will exhibit the Fabry-Perot like maximums around wavelengths where sin(kb) is zero. Such a behaviour
has already been described in refs.11,21,22. The shifts of the resonance wavelengths from the Fabry-Perot resonances
are caused by the wavelength dependent terms in the denominator of Eq. 36. It should be noted that the values
of the shifts calculated using Eq. 36 are in good agreement with the shifts calculated using the analytical formula
(8) of the study 21. Our computations showed that the peak heights at the main (strongest) resonant wavelength

0 (in the case of Fig. 3, λR

behaviour of the transmission coeﬃcient is in agreement with analytical and experimental results published earlier21,22.
The enhancement coeﬃcient (Tcw ∼
30) calculated using Eqs. 35 and 36, however, is diﬀerent from the attenuation
(Tcw < 1) predicted by the study 21. The one order diﬀerence between the experimental value and the enhancement
calculated in the present article is attributed to the small transverse dimension D (D
λ/2) of the metal plates that
form the slit. In our calculations we studied a slit in inﬁnite transverse dimension (D =

0 = 500 or 800 nm) are given by Tcw(λR

).

Analysis of Fig. 3 indicates that a minimum thickness of the screen is required to get the waveguide resonance
inside the slit at a given wavelength. The result is in agreement with the study 21, which demonstrated that there
is no transmission peaks at the condition b < λ/2. Notice that the transmission enhancement mediated by surface
plasmons does exist at considerably smaller thicknesses of the metal in comparison with the thickness required for
the waveguide resonance. The surface plasmons/polaritons are excited in the skin, the depth of which is about the
extinction length of the energy decay of electromagnetic wave in the metal. For instance, the extinction length in
4 nm for λ = 800 nm. Therefore, for not too narrow slits (2a = 25 nm) in thick screens
an aluminum screen is
(b = 200 and 350 nm) considered in the paper, the ﬁnite skin depth does not fundamentally modify the process of the
extraordinary optical transmission. At the wavelength 800 nm, the 10-times enhancement (Tcw(a, λ)
10)
is limited by the slit width (2a = 25 nm).
100 µm) several orders of magnitude
enhancement can be achieved at the same experimental conditions. It should be noted that the optimal choice of
parameters has been discussed in the literature and the obtained enhancement by the factors 10 and 1000 are typical
for continuous waves in the optical and far-infrared spectral ranges. In the case of narrower and thinner slits, however,
the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite conductivity eﬀects on the transmission and localization of a pulse should be taken into
account 3,21.

The existence of transmission resonances for Fourier ω-components of a wave-packet leads to the question: What
eﬀect the resonant enhancement has on the spatial and temporal localization of a light pulse? Presumably, the high
transmission at resonance occurs when the system eﬃciently channels Fourier-components of the wave-packet from a
wide area through the slit. At resonance, one might assume that if the energy ﬂow is symmetric about the screen,
the pulse width and duration should increase very rapidly past the screen. Thus the large pulse strength associated
with resonance could only be obtained at the expense of the spatial and temporal broadening of the wave-packet.
To test this hypothesis, the spatial distributions of the energy ﬂux of a transmitted wave-packet were computed for
diﬀerent slit thicknesses corresponding to the resonance and anti-resonance position. The characteristic diﬀerence
between the resonant and non-resonant transmissions could be understood better through a single ﬁgure of the ﬁeld
distributions in all regions I, II and III. However, it seems to be impossible to do this, because the visualization of
a pulse by a single ﬁgure requires a 4-dimensional (U, x, z, t) coordinate system or a great number of 3-dimensional
ﬁgures at diﬀerent locations and suitable ﬁxed times in all the regions. Therefore we present the eight 3-dimensional
distributions (4(a)-(d) and 5(a)-(d)) only in the zone of main interest (region III). As an example, Figs. 4 (a) and
5 (a) show the energy ﬂux of the anti-resonantly transmitted pulses. Figures 4 (b) and 5 (b) correspond to the case
of the waveguide-mode resonance in the slit. Figures 4 and 5 show the transmitted pulses at the distances
= a/2
and a, respectively. The rigorous analysis3 showed that the number of modes required for the accurate computation
of the transmittance, near-ﬁeld distribution, and other optical characteristics of the system is given by N > 2a/z,

where N is the number of the waveguide modes and z is the distance from the screen. Therefore at the distances

= a/2 and a the calculations required at least 4 and 2 modes, respectively.

The shape and intensity of an output pulse depends on the slit parameters and the spectral width of the pulse.
For narrow slits, the spectral width of a 100-fs input pulse is smaller compared to the spectral width of the resonant
transmission (see, Fig. 3). The comparison of the ﬂux distribution presented in Fig. 4 (a) with that of Fig. 4 (b)
shows that, for the parameter values adopted, a transmitted wavepacket is enhanced by one order of magnitude and
simultaneously localized in the 25-nm and 100-fs domains of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone. The shapes of the intensity
distributions of the output pulses are very much the same oﬀ and on resonance. The ﬁgures diﬀer only in the order
of magnitude of Sz. Thus at the distance
= a/2, the slit resonantly enhances the intensity of the pulse without its
spatial and temporal broadening. The result can be easily understood by considering the dispersion properties of the
slit. For the screen thickness b = 200 nm, the amplitudes of the Fourier-components of the wave-packet, whose central
wavelength λ0 is detuned from the main (at 500 nm) resonance, are practically unchanged in the wavelength region
near 800 nm (see, curve B in Fig. 3). This provides the dispersion- and distortion-free non-resonant transmission of
the wave-packet (Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)). In the case of the thicker screen (b = 350 nm), the slit transmission experiences
strong mode-coupling regime at the wavelengths near to 800 nm (see curve A of Fig. 3) that leads to a profound and
uniform enhancement of amplitudes of all of the Fourier ω-components of the wave-packet (see curve C in Fig. 3).
Thus, the slit resonantly enhances by one order of magnitude the intensity of the pulse without its spatial and temporal
broadenings (Figs. 4(b) and 5(b)). Also, notice that at the distance
= a (Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)), both the resonantly
and anti-resonantly transmitted pulses experience natural spatial broadening in the transverse direction, while their
durations are practically unchanged. The spectral width of a 5-fs input pulse, however, is bigger than the spectral
width of the resonant transmission (Fig. 3). In this case the durations of the resonantly transmitted 5-fs pulses are
longer in comparison with the pulses transmitted oﬀ the resonance (Figs. 4(c), (d) and respectively 5(c), (d)). We
also notice that the enhancement of the intensity of 5-fs pulses is approximately two times lower in comparison with
the 100-fs pulses. The temporal broadening of the pulse and the decrease of the enhancement indicates a natural
limitation for the simultaneous temporal and spatial localization of a pulse together with its enhancement.

By comparing the data for anti-resonant and resonant transmissions presented in Figs. 4 and 5 one can see that at
the appropriate values of the distance
and the wave-packet spectral width ∆ω the resonance eﬀect does not inﬂuence
the spatial and temporal localization of the wave-packet. To verify this somewhat unexpected result, the FWHMs of
the transmitted pulse in the transverse and longitudinal directions were calculated for diﬀerent values of the slit width
2a, central wavelength λ0 and pulse duration τ
1/∆ωp as a function of screen thickness b at two particular near-ﬁeld
distances
= a/2 and a from the screen. It was seen that, at the dispersion-free resonant transmission condition
∆ωp < ∆ωr, the transmitted pulse indeed does not experience temporal broadening. Thus the temporal localization
associated with the duration τ of the incident pulse remains practically unchanged under the transmission. The value
of τ is determined by the dispersion-free condition τ
1/∆ωp > 1/∆ωr, where ∆ωr = ∆ωr(a) practically does not
depend on the screen thickness b. We found that the energy ﬂux of the transmitted wave-packet can be enhanced
by a factor Tcw(λR
0 ), for an example see
Figs. 3-5. Thus the wave-packet can be enhanced by a factor λR
0 /2πa and simultaneously localized in the time domain
at the τ = τ (a) scale. It was also seen that the FWHM of the transmitted pulse in the transverse direction depends on
the wave-packet central wavelength λ0 and the distance z from the slit. Nevertheless, the FWHM of the transmitted
pulse can be always reduced to the value 2a by the appropriate decreasing of the distance
from the screen
(
= a/2, in the case of Fig. 4). Thus high transmission can be achieved without concurrent loss in the degree of
z
|
temporal and spatial localizations of the pulse. In retrospect, this result is reasonable, since the symmetry of the
problem for a time-harmonic continuous wave (Fourier ω-component of a wave-packet) is disrupted by the presence
of the initial and reﬂected ﬁelds in addition to the diﬀracted ﬁeld on one side (Eq. 6). As the thickness changes, the
ﬁelds U d and U3 change only in magnitude, but the ﬁeld U1 changes in distribution as well since it involves the sum
of U d with unchanging ﬁelds U i and U r. At resonance, the distribution of U1 leads to channeling of the radiation,
but the distribution of U3 remains unaﬀected. By the appropriate adjusting of the slit-pulse parameters a light pulse
can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm-
and fs-scales.

The limitations of the above analysis must be considered before the results are used for a particular experimental
device. The resonant enhancement with simultaneous nm-scale spatial and fs-scale temporal localizations of a light
by a subwavelength metal nano-slit is a consequence of the assumption of the screen perfect conductivity. The slit
can be made of perfectly conductive (at low temperatures) materials. In the context of current technology, however,
the use of conventional materials like metal ﬁlms at a room temperature is more practical. Notice that a metal
can be considered as a perfect conductor in the microwave range. As a general criterion, the perfect conductivity
assumption should remain valid as far as the slit width and the screen thickness exceed the extinction length for
the Fourier ω-components of a wavepacket within the metal. The light intensity decays in the metal screen at the
b/δ), where δ = δ(λ) is the extinction length in the screen. The aluminum has the largest
rate of Is = I0 exp(

opacity (δ < 11 nm) in the spectral region λ > 100 nm [20]. The extinction length increases from 11 to 220 nm
with decreasing the wavelength from 100 to 50 nm. Hence, the perfect conductivity is a very good approximation in
1/∆ωp
a situation involving a relatively thick (b > 25 nm) aluminum screen and a wave-packet of the duration τ
having the Fourier components in the spectral region λ > 100 nm. However, in the case of thinner screens, shorter
pulses and smaller central wavelengths of wave-packets, the metal ﬁlms are not completely opaque. This would reduce
a value of spatial localization of a pulse due to passage of the light through the screen in the region away from the
slit. Moreover, the phase shifts of the Fourier components along the propagation path caused by the skin eﬀect can
modify the enhancement coeﬃcient and temporal localization properties of the slit.

The above analysis is directly applicable to the two-dimensional near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy and spec-
troscopy. Although the computations were performed in the case of normal incidence, the preliminary analysis shows
that in the case of oblique incidence the enhancement eﬀect can be kept without further spatial and temporal broad-
ening of the pulse. In a conventional 2D NSOM, a subwavelength (2a < λ) slit illuminated by a continuous wave

transmission of fs pulses could provide ultrahigh resolution of 2D NSOM simultaneously in space and time17,18. The
above-described resonantly enhanced transmission together with nm- and fs-scale localizations in the space and time
of a pulse could greatly increase the potentials of the 2D near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy,
especially in high-resolution applications. However, as a model for a NSOM-tip a hole (quadratic, rectangular or
circular) would be more appropriate than a slit-type waveguide. The consequences of the limitation of region II also
in y-direction will result in faster attenuation of the amplitude of the waveguide modes compared to the slit-type
waveguide modes 3. This should aﬀect the enhancement and spatial and temporal broadening of the pulse. Moreover,
the walls of the 2D slit have to be parallel over all the thickness to provide the resonance enhancement eﬀect. Pulled
NSOM 3D-tips, however, usually have conical ends. In the case of the tapered NSOM 3D waveguides one should
also take into account the decrease of enhancement eﬀect with increasing the waveguide taper.
It should be also
noted that the high transmission (Tcw(λR

should be taken into consideration. The potential applications of the eﬀect of the resonantly enhanced transmission
together with nm- and fs-scale localizations of a pulse are not limited to near-ﬁeld microscopy and spectroscopy.
Broadly speaking, the eﬀect concerns all physical phenomena and photonic applications involving a transmission of
light by a single subwavelength nano-slit, a grating with subwavevelength slits and a subwavelength slit surrounded
by parallel grooves (see the studies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37 and
references therein). For instance, the eﬀect could be used for sensors, communications, optical switching devices and
microscopes.

IV. CONCLUSION

In the present article we have considered the question whether a light pulse can be enhanced and simultaneously
localized in space and time by a subwavelength metal nano-slit. To address this question, the spatial distributions
of the energy ﬂux of an ultrashort (fs) pulse diﬀracted by a subwavelength (nanosized) slit in a thick metal screen of
perfect conductivity have been analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution
of Maxwell’s equations. The analysis of the spatial distributions for various regimes of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction
demonstrated that the energy ﬂux of a wavepacket can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously
localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales. The extraordinary transmission, together with
nm- and fs-scale localizations of the light pulse, make the nano-slit structures attractive for many photonic purposes,
such as sensors, communication, optical switching devices and NSOM. We also believe that the addressing of the
above-mentioned basic question gains insight into the physics of near-ﬁeld resonant diﬀraction.

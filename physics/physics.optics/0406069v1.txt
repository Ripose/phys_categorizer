Overlapped Intrachannel Cross-Phase Modulation in Highly Dispersive
Phase-Modulated Transmission Systems

(Dated: February 20, 2014)

When two phase modulated pulses are overlapped, intrachannel cross-phase
modulation (IXPM) may be larger than self-phase modulation (SPM) or intra-
channel four-wave-mixing (IFWM). Depending of the phases of the overlapped
pulses, overlapped IXPM gives phase noise to the optical signals.

Keywords: cross-phase modulation, phase modulation, intrachannel XPM.

Intrachannel nonlinear eﬀects, such as intrachannel
cross-phase modulation (IXPM) and intrachannel four-
wave-mixing (IFWM), are the major degradation of
pseudo-linear high-speed transmission system in which
each optical pulse is broadened by ﬁber dispersion and
overlapped with each other1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. For systems us-
ing on-oﬀ keying, IXPM and IFWM induce timing and
amplitude jitter to existing optical pulses, respectively.
IFWM gives ghost pulses in the time slots without op-
tical pulses.

Recently, return-to-zero (RZ) diﬀerential phase-shift
keying (DPSK) signals have received renewed interests
for long-haul transmission systems9,10,11.
In term of
optical intensity, without pulse overlapping, RZ-DPSK
signal is a constant pulse train that increases the tol-
erance to ﬁber nonlinearities. Information converses in
the phase diﬀerence between consecutive optical pulses.
Compared to on-oﬀ keying, DPSK signal gives 3 dB re-
ceiver sensitivity improvement for system with ampliﬁer
noise. The eﬀect of IFWM to RZ-DPSK signal in highly
dispersive system was analyzed recently by Wei and Liu8.
IXPM is assumed to induce no distortion to DPSK signal.
For systems with many wavelength-division-multiplexed
channels,
interchannel cross-phase modulation (XPM)
also induces minimal distortion to the DPSK signals12,13.
The optical pulses with DPSK signal are denoted as

(t

kT )/2τ 2],

uk = bkvk,

without and with phase modulation, where A > 0 is the
peak pulse magnitude, τ and 1.66τ are the 1/e and full-
width-half-maximum (FWHM) pulse width, respectively,
T is the bit period, and bk =
1 is the phase modulation.
±
The optical power of the pulse train is P0 = √πA2τ /T .
With nonoverlapped pulses, neither XPM nor IXPM in-
duces phase noise to a DPSK signal. For example, if the
pulse of uk, k
= 0 induces a phase shift to u0 via IXPM,
the pulse of uk+1 also induces IXPM to u1. The phase

∗Electronic address: kpho@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw

shift to both u0 and u1 is identical and the diﬀerential
phase between the pulses of u0 and u1 remains the same.
With overlapped pulses, IXPM may give a large phase
variation to the optical pulse. For the optical pulse of
u0, the largest overlapped IXPM is induced by the com-
bined eﬀect of the preceding and subsequent pulses of
u±1. The instantaneous IXPM phase shift is propor-

, respectively. Overlapped

IXPM is induced only if the two pulses of u±1 overlap.
While the nonoverlapped IXPM eﬀects are independent
of the phases of b±1, overlapped IXPM is either positive
or negative for antipodal or identical phases of b±1. For
the same peak amplitude, overlapped IXPM for on-oﬀ
keying signals is a quarter of that for DPSK signals be-
cause bk = 0, 1. The overlapped IXPM from u±1 with
b±1 = 1 in on-oﬀ keying signal is symmetrical to t = 0
and does not give timing jitter to u0.

In additional to overlapped IXPM, the three pulses
of u0 and u±1 contributes to many other intrachannel
nonlinear eﬀects. With u(t) = u−1 + u0 + u1, optical

However, those IFWM components are contributed from
diﬀerent portions of the pulses.

ence with the numerical calculation of (3). Figure 2 also

case, where ∆u0 is the amplitude variation4 and the fac-
tor of 2 includes the two degenerate terms of IFWM8.
Figure 2 also includes the calculation of IFWM based
on the approximation using exponential integral4. The
amount of IFWM in Fig. 2 is the same as that from the
individual eﬀect of (l, m, n) = (
1). In long dis-
tance, overlapped IXPM gives a phase variation 3.5 times
larger than that from IFWM and 2.5 times larger than
that from SPM. Overlapped IXPM is a major degrada-
tion eﬀects to DPSK signals in dispersive ﬁber.

Figure 3 show the probability density of the phase vari-
ation of Φ0 and Φ1 for a 100-km ﬁber link with z∗ = 50-
km dispersion precompensation5,8. Figure 3 is from the
center two pulses of a simulation with 20 random pulses.
All 220

3, both Φ0 and Φ1 are zero-mean random variables.

Figure 3(a) is the joint density of Φ0 and Φ1 to show
strong dependence between overlapped IXPM for adja-
cent pulses. The correlation coeﬃcient is equal to 0.79.
With large pulse overlapped, for example, the overlapped
IXPM from u−1 and u2 to u0 and u1 are very similar.
The three lobes of the distribution of Fig. 3(a) are from,
for example, the change signs of b0 to either
1 and its
eﬀects to the pulse of u1. The two adjacent pulses have
the largest eﬀects to overlapped IXPM.

±

Figure 3(b) shows the probability density of the very
asymmetrical but zero-mean random variable of Φ0. The
positive side of Φ0 is exponential distributed and has a
very long tail. Figure 3(c) shows the probability density
Φ0 with a reduced
of the diﬀerential phase shift of Φ1 −
broadening due to the dependence of Φ0 and Φ1. Figure
3(c) also shows a Gaussian ﬁt for the tail of the distribu-
tion. In the special case of Fig. 3, the standard deviation
Φ0 is just 65% that of Φ0 or Φ1 along. The dis-
of Φ1 −
tribution of Fig. 3(c) for diﬀerential phase also has a tail
decrease more rapidly than the phase distribution of Fig.
3(b).

In summary, we have shown that overlapped IXPM
induced large phase variation to a DPSK signal, to our
knowledge, the ﬁrst time. Overlapped IXPM components
give a phase variation even larger than both IFWM and
SPM, potentially the dominant intrachannel impairment
to DPSK signals.

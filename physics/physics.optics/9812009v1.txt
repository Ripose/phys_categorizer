Abstract

This paper aims to present the pure ﬁeld part of the newly developed nonlinear Ex-
tended Electrodynamics [1]-[3] in non-relativistic terms, i.e.
in terms of the electric and
magnetic vector ﬁelds (E, B), and to give explicitly those strictly localized (3+1)-soliton
solutions of the new equations which have the integral properties of photons. The set of
solutions to the new equations contains all solutions to Maxwell’s equations as a subclass.
The new solutions, called nonlinear, are identiﬁed through the non-zero values of two
and ~
appropriately deﬁned vector ﬁelds ~
. The important characteristics scale factor,
M
F
amplitude function, and phase function of a nonlinear solution are deﬁned in a coordinate
free way and eﬀectively used. The intrinsic angular momentum (spin) is also deﬁned.
A limited superposition principle (interference of nonlinear solutions), yielding the well
known classical coherence conditions, is found to exist.

Introduction

The 19th century physics, due mainly to Faraday and Maxwell, created the theoretical concept
of electromagnetic ﬁeld, i.e. extended (in fact, inﬁnite) object, having dynamical structure.
The concepts of ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld through a 2-dimensional surface and circulation of a
vector ﬁeld along a closed curve were coined and used extensively. Maxwell’s equations in their
integral form establish where the time-changes of the ﬂuxes of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
go to, or come from, in both cases of a closed 2-surface and a 2-surface with a boundary. We
note that these ﬂuxes are speciﬁc to the continuous character of the physical object under
consideration and it is important also to note that Maxwell’s ﬁeld equations have not the sense
of direct energy-momentum balance relations as the Newton’s law ˙p = F has. Nevertheless,
they are consistent with energy-momentum conservation, as is well known, the corresponding
local energy-momentum quantities are quadratic functions of the electric and magnetic vectors.
Although very useful for considerations in ﬁnite regions with boundary conditions, the pure
ﬁeld Maxwell’s equations have time-dependent vacuum solutions (in the whole space) that give
an inadequate description of the real ﬁelds. As a rule, if these solutions are time-stable, they
occupy the whole 3-space or an inﬁnite subregion of it, and they do not go to zero at inﬁnity,
hence, they carry inﬁnite energy and momentum. As an example we recall the plane wave
solution, given by the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the form

E =

u(ct + εz), p(ct + εz), 0

; B =

εp(ct + εz),

εu(ct + εz), 0

where u and p are arbitrary diﬀerentiable functions. Even if u and p are soliton-like with respect
to the coordinate z, they do not depend on the other two spatial coordinates (x, y). Hence, the
3, or its inﬁnite subregion, and clearly it carries inﬁnite integral
solution occupies the whole
energy (we use Gauss units)

and, therefore, could hardly be a model of a really created ﬁeld.

On the other hand, according to Cauchy’s theorem for the wave equation (which is neces-
sarily satisﬁed by the components of E and B in the pure ﬁeld case), every ﬁnite (and smooth
enough) initial ﬁeld conﬁguration is strongly time-unstable [4]: the initial condition blows up
radially and goes to inﬁnity (see the next section). Hence, Maxwell’s equations cannot describe
ﬁnite and time-stable localized ﬁelds. The contradictions between theory and experiment that
became clear at the end of the last century were a challenge to theoretical physics. Planck and
Einstein created the notion of elementary ﬁeld quanta, named later by Lewis [5] the photon.
The concept of photon proved to be very seminal and has been widely used in the 20th century
physics. However, even now, after almost a century, we still do not have a complete and satis-
factory self-consistent theory of single photons. It worths recalling at this place the Einstein’s

2

remarks of unsatisfaction concerning the linear character of Maxwell theory which makes it not
able to describe the microstructure of radiation [6]. Along this line we may also note here some
other results and oppinions [7]-[8].

In this paper we consider single photons as (3+1)-dimensional extended ﬁnite objects, moving
as a whole in a consistent translational- rotational manner with the speed of light. Their integral
characteristics like frequency, period and spin are considered to be intrinsically related to their
dynamical structure, and the most important integral quantity characterizing the single photon
seems to be its intrinsic action, this being put equal to Planck’s constant h. The point-like
view on photons can never give a satisfactory explanation of where the characteristic frequency
of a free photon comes from. Extended Electrodynamics (EED) [1]-[3] was built mainly to meet
this view, i.e. to give a consistent ﬁeld description of single photons, and this paper gives a
completely non-relativistic approach to the pure ﬁeld part of EED. This gives new insights into
the problem.

Our assumption that single photons are objects of a ﬁnite nature has as its mathematical
representation the soliton concept. In accordance with this concept the components of E and
B at every moment t have to be smooth functions and diﬀerent from zero only inside a ﬁnite
3. Moreover, a periodic process of constant frequency has to go
3-dimensional region Ωt
inside Ω consistently with the straight line motion as a whole. Hence, we have to be ready
to meet all diﬃculties coming from the unavoidable requirements for nonlinear equations and
working with ﬁnite functions with respect to the spatial variables (x, y, z). This goes along
with Einstein’s view that ”the whole theory must be based on partial diﬀerential equations and
their singularity-free solutions”[9].

We recall ﬁrst Maxwell’s equations in the pure ﬁeld case:

where ξ denotes the product ct, c is the velocity of light and t is the time variable. From these
equations we get the well known Poynting relation

We explain now why Maxwell’s equations (1)-(2) have no (3+1) soliton-like solutions. As
[10]) from (1) and (2) it

we know from textbooks on Classical Electrodynamics (CED), (e.g.
follows that every component U of E and B necessarily satisﬁes the wave equation

We are interested in the behavior of U at t > 0, if at t = 0 the function U satisﬁes the initial
conditions

where the functions f (x, y, z) and F (x, y, z) are ﬁnite, i.e. they are diﬀerent from zero in some
3 and have no singularities. Besides, we assume also that f is continuously
ﬁnite region Ωo
diﬀerentiable up to third order, and F is continuously diﬀerentiable up to the second order.
Under these conditions Poisson proved (about 1818) that a unique solution U(x, y, z; t) of the
wave equation is deﬁned, and it is expressed by the initial conditions f and F through the
following formula (a good explanation is given in [4]):

)

(5)

where P is a point on the sphere S of radius r = ct, centered at the point (x, y, z), and dσr is
the surface element on Sr=ct.

The above formula (5) shows the following. In order to get the solution at the moment t > 0
at the point (x, y, z), being at an arbitrary position with respect to the region Ωo, where the
initial condition, deﬁned by the two functions f and F , is concentrated, we have to integrate
f /r and F/r over a sphere Sr=ct, centered at (x, y, z) and having a radius of r = ct, and then to
form the expression (5). Clearly, the solution will be diﬀerent from zero only if the sphere Sr=ct
crosses the region Ωo at the moment t > 0. Consequently, if r1 = ct1 is the shortest distance
from (x, y, z) to Ωo, and r2 = ct2 is the longest distance from (x, y, z) to Ωo, then the solution
at (x, y, z) will be diﬀerent from zero only inside the interval (t1, t2).

From another point of view this means the following. The initially concentrated in the
region Ωo perturbation begins to expand radially, it comes to the point (x, y, z) at the moment
t1 > 0, makes it ”vibrate” ( i.e. our devices show the availability of a ﬁeld) during the time
t1, after this the point goes back to its initial state and our devices ﬁnd no
interval ∆t = t2 −
more the ﬁeld. Through every point out of Ωo there will pass a wave, and its forefront reaches
the point (x, y, z) at the moment t1 while its backfront leaves the same point at the moment
t2. Roughly speaking, the initial condition ”blows up” radially and goes to inﬁnity with the
velocity of light.

This rigorous mathematical result shows that every ﬁnite nonstatic solution of Maxwell’s
equations in vacuum is time-unstable, so these equations have no ﬁnite and smooth enough,
i.e. nonsingular, time-dependent solutions, which could be used as models of real photons, as
viewed by us.

Hence, if we want to describe 3-dimensional time-dependent soliton-like electromagnetic
formations (or conﬁgurations) it is necessary to leave oﬀ Maxwell’s equations and to look for
new equations for E and B.

On the other hand we know that Maxwell’s theory is widely used in almost all natural
sciences and electrical engineering, so, it does not seem reasonable to leave it oﬀ entirely and
to look for a completely new theory. Moreover, in all energy computations for ﬁnite volumes, it
gives very good results. This suggests to look for some extension of the theory, i.e. to extend in
a nonlinear way the equations, keeping all solutions to Maxwell’s equations as solutions to the
new equations and keeping the energy-momentum relations of Maxwell’s theory as relations of
the new theory. In the same time we must incorporate new solutions with corresponding to our
purpose properties.

The road we are going to follow in searching for the appropriate nonlinearization of (1)-(2)
is suggested mainly by two ideas: the idea of local energy- momentum conservation, and the
idea of invariance of Maxwell’s equations (1)-(2) with respect to the transformation

(E, B)

(

We begin by recalling Newton’s law ˙p=F: its true sense is local momentum balance, i.e. the
momentum gained by the particle is lost by the external ﬁeld. So, if the particle is absent then
the ﬁeld will not lose its momentum and we get the equation F = 0. What we have to do now
is to express this F in terms of the corresponding ﬁeld functions. In other words, we have to
determine in terms of the ﬁeld functions and their derivatives how much momentum the ﬁeld
is potentially able to transfer to another physical system in case of its presence and ability to
interact with the ﬁeld.

In order to do this in the case of electrodynamics we recall that if the other system consists
of charged particles the corresponding force is the well known Lorentz’ force, acting on a particle
of electric charge e: F = eE + e
B). In case of a continuous distribution of particles with
charge density of ρ the Lorentz’ force is

The corresponding Maxwell’s equations with non-zero charge distribution ρ and current j = ρv
in this case read:

4π
c
In order to make consistent these last equations with the Lorentz’ force in the continuous charge
distribution case we substitute j and ρ from these Maxwell’s equations into the above given
Lorentz’ force. Then we put F = 0. Finally, we forget about the character of the ”other
system”, and interpret F as the momentum which the ﬁeld is potentially able to transfer to
any physical system that is able to absorb it.
In some sense, this deﬁnes one of the ﬁeld’s
momentum exchanging abilities.

j, divE = 4πρ.

In this way we obtain our ﬁrst extended equation:

B + EdivE = 0.

This vector equation (7) extends Maxwell’s equations (1) in the sense that (7) implies no more
(1), i.e. (7) may have solutions which do not satisfy (1) and these new solutions, at least some of
them, are considered as admissible. The physical sense of (7) is quite clear: no ﬁeld momentum
is lost in this way. The nonlinearity of (7) is also obvious.

Now we look for another momentum exchanging ability of the ﬁeld, diﬀerent from the ﬁrst
one, and directed in general to new physical systems. In order to come to such an expression
B, E) invariance of the pure ﬁeld Maxwell’s
we make use of the above mentioned (E, B)

Moreover, the basic energy-momentum balance relation of Poynting (3), is also invariant with
respect to this transformation (6). This suggests that, transforming (7), i.e. replacing in (7)
E by
B and B by E, we should obtain also a true and valuable relation, since (7) describes
now intra-ﬁeld local momentum balance. In this way we obtain our second extended vector
equation:

Hence, (8) deﬁnes explicitly another momentum exchanging ability of the ﬁeld. Note that (8)
is obtained from (7) in the same way as (2) is obtained from (1).

We complete this process of extension of Maxwell’s equations by adding two new invariant
with respect to the same transformation (6) equations, which also have the physical sense of
intra-ﬁeld local energy-momentum balance:

Note that under the transformation (6) equations (7) and (8) transform into each other,

while equations (9) and (10) are kept the same (up to a sign of the left-hand side).

Equations (7)-(10) constitute our new system of equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in
vacuum. Obviously, they do not introduce new parameters, they are non-linear and all solutions
to Maxwell’s equations are solutions to the new equations. We are going now to study those
new solutions to (7)-(10), which satisfy the conditions

Relation (12) says that the electric and magnetic vectors of every nonlinear solution are nec-
essarily orthogonal to each other at every point, the algebraic property that Maxwell’s (linear)
plane wave solution has. From (13) it follows that the Poynting’s relation (3) is true for all
nonlinear solutions, and this justiﬁes the usage of all energy-momentum quantities and relations
from Maxwell’s theory in the set of nonlinear solutions of the new equations. We can consider
the left-hand sides of relations (13) as the energy quantities which the ﬁeld may transfer to some
other physical object. We note also the invariance of (12)-(13) with respect to transformation
(6).

4 Photon-Like Solutions

As we mentioned earlier, we consider photons as ﬁnite nonsingular objects moving as a whole
along straight lines in the 3-space with the velocity of light. The direction of motion is assumed
to be that of (E
B) have to be straight lines.
If we choose the coordinate system (x, y, z) so that this direction of motion to coincide with
the direction of the coordinate line z, in this coordinate system the vector ﬁelds E and B will
have non-zero components only along x and y:

B). This means that the integral curves of (E

and we have to determine just the two functions u and p.

The above relations show that instead of u and p we can work with φ and ϕ. Equations (7)-
(10) require only φ to be running wave along z (in this coordinate system), and ϕ to be bounded
function. In all other respects these two smooth functions are arbitrary. Hence, they may be
chosen ﬁnite with respect to the spatial coordinates (x, y, z). Hence, the nonlinear equations
(7)-(10) allow (3 + 1) soliton-like solutions. Note that, since ϕ is bounded, it is suﬃcient to
choose just φ to be spatially ﬁnite.

We are going to show now that the two functions φ and ϕ have a certain invariant sense

and can be introduced in a coordinate free way.

First, let’s denote by α the invariant

The invariant sense of the ﬁrst three equations of (25) is that the phase function ϕ is a ﬁrst
integral of the vector ﬁelds E, B, E
B. From the third equation is clearly seen that in this

coordinate system ϕ does not depend on z. The ﬁrst two equations of (25), considered as an
algebraic linear homogeneous system with respect to the two derivatives, yield ϕx = ϕy = 0
because the corresponding determinant is always nonzero: u2 + p2
= 0. Hence, ϕ may depend
only on ξ. In view of (24) and ϕz = 0 the fourth equation ∂L
∂ξ = 0 means L = constant. Hence,
relation (24) turns into equation for ϕ:

theory.

In order to separate the photon-like solutions we recall that the photon’s characteristic
quantity is its integral intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, being equal to the Planck’s constant
h. Namely h represents quantitatively in a uniﬁed manner the rotational and translational
aspects of its dynamical nature: for all photons the product W T has the same value h, although
W and T may be diﬀerent for the diﬀerent photons. That’s why every photon should be able
to determine its own scale factor L = const in order to have a cosine periodic phase function
and to obey the Planck’s law: h = W T = W L/c. The photon’s intrinsic periodic process
demonstrates itself in our approach through the (left or right) rotation of the couple (E, B).
Since these two vectors are orthogonal to each other and with equal modules:
, the
|
basic local quantity appears to be the area of the square deﬁned by E and B at every point,
. During one period T this square performs a full turning
and this area is equal to
.T . In order to obtain the integral action of the
around and this gives the local action
solution we have to sum up all these local actions.

The above described idea is easily represented mathematically. In fact, let u, p and u2 + p2

We note once again that this approach works because W = const <

and the solution is soliton-like, i.e. it is ﬁnite, it has periodic dynamical structure and is time-
stable. Clearly, no solution of Maxwell’s equations (1)-(2) in the whole space has all these
properties.

Deﬁnition 2. A nonlinear solution will be called photon-like if it is spatially ﬁnite, if it

satisﬁes conditions (25) and if its integral spin

is equal to the Planck constant h:

we ask: under what conditions their sum (E1 + E2, B1 + B2) will be again a nonlinear solution?
Having done the corresponding elementary computations, we come to the following important
conclusion: if

ε1 = ε2, κ1 = κ2, L1 = L2

(31)

then the sum (E1 + E2, B1 + B2) is again a nonlinear solution.

These relations (31) coincide with the well known from CED coherence conditions. They
say that the two photon-like solutions will interfere, i.e. their sum will be again a solution, if:

1. They propagate along the same direction: ε1 = ε2,
2. They have the same polarization: κ1 = κ2,
3. They have the same frequency: ν1 = ν2, i.e. the same scale factors.

Recall that in CED these coherence conditions are experimentally found, they do not follow
from the theory as necessary conditions, because CED is a linear theory and the sum of any
two or more solutions is again a solution. For example, the sum ”plane wave + a spherically
symmetric ﬁeld” is again a solution but no interference features are available.

In EED, which is a non-linear theory and there is no superposition principle in general, the
interference of photon-like solutions is a very special case and it is a remarkable result that

S

the experimentally found coherence conditions (31) appear from the nonlinear equations as
necessary conditions, otherwise the sum will not be a solution.

The computation shows that the energy density w of the sum-solution is given by

1
4π

w =

(φ1)2 + (φ2)2 + 2φ1φ2cos(β1 −
and this relation (32) allows to talk about interference instead if superposition: in our approach
the superposition of photon-like solutions leads always to interference.

Of course, from the non-linear point of view, these interference phenomena are of some
interest only for those soliton-like solutions which at a given moment occupy intersecting re-
β2) in (32) is equal to zero. Since the
gions, otherwise the interference term 2φ1φ2cos(β1 −
two summonds follow the same direction of motion as a whole, then the sum-solution will be a
time-stable solution, but it will not be photon-like one. The picture obtained resembles in some
extent the experimentally observed ”two-photon” interference phenomena [11].

5 Conclusion

This paper presents a non-relativistic formulation of an extension of the pure ﬁeld Maxwell
equations. The aim of the extension is to give a mathematical description of the viewpoint
that photons are extended but ﬁnite objects and that their existence is based on a joint and
consistent translational-rotational internal dynamics: a straight-line (translational) motion as a
whole with the velocity of light and a rotation of the mutually orthogonal and perpendicular to
the translation electric and magnetic vector ﬁelds. The general mathematical concept of (3+1)-
soliton was found to be the most adequate one to this physical notion. Its realization through
the nonlinear system (7)-(10) for the couple of vector ﬁelds (E, B) turned out to be successful in
view of the existence of appropriate photon-like solutions. Every photon-like solution has ﬁnite
integral energy W , has its own scale factor L = const, phase function ϕ of cosine type and
corresponding to L and ϕ frequency ν = c/L, or period T = L/c. Every photon-like solution
carries intrinsic angular momentum of integral value equal to the Planck’s constant h = W T ,
which is the famous Planck’s formula. The equations (7)-(10) and the additional conditions
(25) do not determine the spatial structure of the solution and it should be so, because it is
hardly believable that all photons have the same shape and structure. The remarkable limited
superposition principle permits interference in the frame of photon-like solutions only if they
are coherent in the sense of (31).

The existence of strictly localized photon-like solutions in the pure ﬁeld case suggests to
make the corresponding extension of Maxwell’s equations in presence of external ﬁelds (media)
and to look for (3+1)-localized solutions with non-zero proper mass. Such an extension in
relativistic terms was published in 1995 and may be found in [2] together with a family of
variously shaped (3 + 1) soliton-like solutions with non-zero mass and well deﬁned conserved
quantities.

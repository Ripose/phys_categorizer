We study propagation and switching of slow-light pulses in nonlinear couplers
with phase-shifted Bragg gratings. We demonstrate that power-controlled non-
linear self-action of light can be used to compensate dispersion-induced broad-
ening of pulses through the formation of gap solitons, to control pulse switching
in the coupler, and to tune the propagation velocity.

It is known that the speed of light can be dramatically
reduced in photonic-crystal waveguides with a periodic
modulation of the optical refractive index1,2,3.
In the
regime of slow light the photon-matter interactions are
dramatically enhanced4 allowing for all-optical control
and manipulation.
In particular, nonlinear self-action
can be used to dynamically tune the velocity of pulses
propagating in nonlinear Bragg gratings5. At the same
time, nonlinearity can support pulse self-trapping in the
form of a gap soliton which proﬁle remains undistorted
during propagation5, overcoming the limitations of linear
devices due to dispersion-induced pulse broadening6.

Nonlinear eﬀects can also enable ultra-fast all-optical
pulse switching. Pulse routing between output ports con-
trolled by optical power was demonstrated in directional
couplers7,8,9. Additional ﬂexibility in mode conversion
with applications to add-drop ﬁlters10,11,12 is realized by
combining directional coupler geometry and Bragg grat-
ings in optical ﬁbers13 or planar photonic structures14
which operation can be tuned all-optically15, and gap
solitons can also exist in the nonlinear regime16,17,18.

In this Letter, we suggest novel possibilities for dy-
namic manipulation of slow-light pulses which frequency
is tuned in the vicinity of Bragg resonance. The pulse
dynamics can be modeled by a set of coupled-mode
nonlinear equations19 for the normalized slowly vary-
ing envelopes of the forward (un) and backward (wn)
propagating ﬁelds in each of waveguides n = 1, 2,
−i∂un/∂t = i∂un/∂z + Cu3−n + ρnwn + γ(|un|2 +
2|wn|2)un, −i∂wn/∂t = −i∂wn/∂z + Cw3−n + ρ∗

γ(|wn|2 + 2|un|2)wn, where t and z are the dimensionless
time and propagation distance normalized to ts and zs,
respectively, C is the coupling coeﬃcient for the modes of
the neighboring waveguides, ρn characterizes the ampli-
tude and phase of the Bragg gratings, γ is the nonlinear
coeﬃcient, and the group velocity far from the Bragg
resonance is normalized to unity. The scaling coeﬃcients
are ts = λ2

the speed of light in vacuum, λ0 is the wavelength in
vacuum, ∆λ0 is the width of Bragg resonance for an in-
dividual waveguide, n0 is the eﬀective refractive index in
the absence of a grating. To be speciﬁc, in numerical ex-

amples we set γ = 10−2, λ0 = 1550.63nm, ∆λ0 = 0.1nm,
ts ≃ 12.8ps, zs ≃ 1.8mm corresponding to characteristic
parameters of ﬁber Bragg gratings5,13.

We consider the case of identical waveguides and an-
alyze the eﬀect of a phase shift (ϕ) between the oth-
erwise equivalent waveguide gratings with ρ1 = ρ and
ρ2 = ρ exp(iϕ) (with no loss of generality, we take ρ
to be real and positive), see schematic illustrations in
Figs. 1(a,b).
It was shown that the grating shift can
strongly modify the reﬂectivity of modes with diﬀerent
symmetries11,13,14, and we investigate how this structural
parameter aﬀects the properties of slow-light pulses.

In the linear regime, wave propagation is fully deﬁned
through the Floquet-Bloch eigenmode solutions of the
form, un = Un exp (iβz − iωt), wn = Wn exp (iβz − iωt).

Fig. 2. Linear transmission of incident wave coupled to
the ﬁrst waveguide of a semi-inﬁnite (z ≥ 0) coupler with
(a,c,e) in-phase and (b,d,f) out-of-phase Bragg gratings:
(a-d) Intensity distribution (averaged over grating pe-
riod) shown in the ﬁrst (solid line) and second (dashed
line) waveguides for (a,b) large frequency detuning from
the resonance and (c,d) frequency tuned close to the band
edge with slow group velocity vg = 0.1. (e,f) Intensities
at z = 2cm vs. wavelength detuning. Parameters corre-
spond to Fig. 1, and the intensities are normalized to the
input intensity.

After substituting these expressions into the linearized
coupler equations (with γ = 0), we obtain the dis-
persion relation ω2(β) = β2 + C2 + |ρ|2 ± 2C[β2 +
|ρ|2 cos2(ϕ/2)]1/2.

Slow-light propagation can be observed due to the re-
duction of the normalized group velocity (vg = dω/dβ)
when the pulse frequency is tuned close to the bandgap
edge, where the propagating waves with real β are ab-
sent. We ﬁnd that diﬀerent regimes of slow light can be
realized depending on the structural parameters. (i) If
|ρ cos(ϕ/2)/C| > 1, the bandgap appears for ω2 < ω2
g =
C2 + |ρ|2 − 2C|ρ cos(ϕ/2)|, and only a single forward
propagating mode (with vg > 0) exists for the frequen-
cies near the gap edges, see examples in Figs. 1(c,e).
(ii) If |ρ cos(ϕ/2)/C| < 1, the bandgap appears for
|ω| < ωg = |ρ sin(ϕ/2)|, and two types of the forward
propagating modes (with vg > 0) exist simultaneously
(in the regions with β > 0 and β < 0) for the frequen-
cies arbitrarily close to the gap edges, see examples in
Figs. 1(d,f).

We now analyze linear propagation of pulses in a semi-
inﬁnite Bragg grating coupler. When the optical fre-
quency is detuned from the bandgap, light periodically
tunnels between the waveguides with the characteristic
period Lc ≃ π/(2C) deﬁned for a conventional coupler
without the Bragg grating, see examples in Figs. 2(a,b).
The periodic tunneling appears due to the beating of even
and odd modes, which correspond to diﬀerent branches

for diﬀerent values of the normalized peak input intensi-
ties I0 = 10−4, 3.33, 3.37, 4. Shown are the density plots
of intensity in the ﬁrst (left column) and second (middle
column) waveguides. Output intensity proﬁles normal-
ized to I0 at the ﬁrst (solid line) and second (dashed
line) waveguides are shown in the right column. Input

sity of 577ps, and its central wavelength is tuned to the

of the dispersion curves. When the pulse frequency is
tuned closer to the gap edge and (i) only one slow mode
is supported, then periodic beating disappears and light
is equally distributed between the waveguides irrespec-
tive of the input excitation, see Figs. 2(c,e). The pe-
riodic coupling can only be sustained in the slow-light
regime when (ii) two modes co-exist at the gap edge, see
Figs. 2(d,f). Therefore, the conﬁguration with out-of-
phase shifted Bragg gratings is the most preferential for
switching of slow-light pulses, since for ϕ = π the dis-
persion of the type (ii) is always realized for any values
of the grating strength and the waveguide coupling, and
simultaneously the bandgap attains the maximum band-
width.

At higher optical powers, nonlinear eﬀects become im-
portant, and we perform numerical simulations of the
coupler equations to model pulse propagation. Examples
of the pulse dynamics and output pulse characteristics
are presented in Figs. 3 and 4, where we consider the
structure size equal to three coupling lengths, L = 3Lc.
In the linear regime, the pulse tunnels three times be-
tween the waveguides and switches accordingly to the
other waveguide at the output, see Fig. 3(a). However,
at the same time the pulse signiﬁcantly broadens due
to the eﬀect of the group-velocity dispersion (GVD). As

the input pulse energy is increased, nonlinearity may
support dispersionless slow-light pulses in the form of
gap solitons, studied previously in single5 and coupled
waveguides with in-phase gratings16,17,18. Most remark-
ably, we ﬁnd that the presence of two types of slow-
light modes in the structure with out-of-phase gratings
gives rise to a new type of gap solitons which period-
ically tunnel between the waveguides while preserving
a constant width, see Figs. 3(b-d) and Fig. 4(b).
In
agreement with the properties of conventional nonlinear
couplers7,8,9, the coupling length is gradually extended
as the optical power is increased, resulting in the pulse
switching between the output waveguides, see Fig. 4(a).
As the input power is further increased, we observe a
sharp switching when the output is highly sensitive to
small changes of the input intensity (less than 1%), cf.
Figs. 3(b) and (c). At the same time, the pulse delay
is also varied with optical power, as shown in Fig. 4(c).
The power tunability of the pulse delay and switching
dynamics can be adjusted by selecting parameters such
as waveguide coupling, and choosing the frequency de-
tuning from the gap edge.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ﬂexible ma-
nipulation of slow-light pulses can be realized in a non-
linear couplers with phase-shifted Bragg gratings, imple-
mented as all-ﬁber13 or planar waveguide devices created
in highly nonlinear materials20,21. We predict the possi-
bility to simultaneously suppress pulse spreading due to
dispersion, all-optically tune the pulse velocity and tran-
sit delays, and switch pulses between the output ports.

We anticipate that similar eﬀects may be achieved in
other types of photonic structures including photonic-
crystal waveguides22 and ﬁbers23 engineered to support
several co-propagating slow-light modes. Our results also
suggest new opportunities for control of slow-light bullets
in periodic waveguide arrays24.

Abstract

Defocused speckle photography has long been used to measure rota-
tions of rough surfaces. This paper explains how, by adding a suitably
perforated mask, some measurement properties, such as range or lateral
resolution, may be changed at wish. Particularly, the maximum measur-
able tilt can be signiﬁcantly raised, although at the expense of poorer
lateral resolution. Advantages over previously described techniques in-
clude independent tuning of speckle size and optical system aperture and
more extended adaptability to diﬀerent measuring needs. The beneﬁts and
disadvantages of the new and old techniques are thoroughly compared.

1 Introduction

When a rough surface is illuminated by a laser beam, a granular eﬀect is ob-
served. This grainy pattern is known as speckle. Though this eﬀect used to
be considered a nuisance in early coherent photography, it has proved to be a
valuable tool for the observation of mechanical transformations in solid bodies.
Diﬀerent optical systems can be used to obtain a record of speckles. Although
surface roughness causes their formation, their statistics are generally quite in-
dependent of the particular microtopography of the surface and are more related
to the optical set-up for illumination and recording.1 Speckle patterns do not
oﬀer great information about the rough surface that generates it. However, the
relation between the speckle patterns taken from a surface before and after a
transformation may be used to obtain information about it.

Assuming expanded beam illumination, object in-plane displacements (move-
ments parallel to the surface under observation) may cause speckle pattern
translations when the optical system is focused on the object surface, whereas
out-of-plane rotations (tilts around in-plane axis) will not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the image. On the other hand, if the speckle pattern is recorded at the Fourier
plane of the object surface, in-plane displacements will not appreciably change
the speckles, although out-of-plane rotations will displace them.2 When the
optics is not focused on the object surface, the speckle pattern is said to be
defocused. Defocused speckle photography is being used today as a mean to
monitor and measure out-of-plane rotations in rigid solids or their distributions
in the boundaries of elastic bodies. This paper develops an analysis of measur-
ing characteristics such as lateral resolution or maximum measurable rotation
in existing technologies, then presents a new enhancement for them and ﬁnally
compares the measuring power in both systems.

2 Antecedents

The ﬁrst paper describing a defocused two-exposure method to measure out-
of-plane rotations was due to Tiziani,3 and was later extended for vibration
analysis.4 The principle is simple and can be understood from the following
consideration: when an initially vertical ﬂat mirror undergoes an out-of-plane
rotation around its horizontal direction, objects reﬂected by the mirror seem
to be displaced upwards (or downwards) proportionally to their distance to
the mirror. Considering the Kirchhoﬀ approximation for the scattering from
a rough body,5,6 the surface can be thought of as a big set of small mirrors,
slightly rotated from the mean plane. When the object is tilted, all those small
mirrors experiment the same out-of-plane rotation and when focusing on a plane
placed at a distance ζ from the surface, the amplitude distributions of the waves
originated from all those micro-mirrors are all displaced by the same distance
which is proportional to ζ. The speckle pattern is thus displaced by an amount
that depends on the tilt and can be used to measure it. Tiziani used collimated
illumination and recorded the image at the back focal plane of the lens.

If normal illumination and observation are used (Fig. 1), the speckle shift is

given by7

dx = 2f β
dy = −2f α

(1)

(2)

where α, β are the (small) rotation angles around the x, y axis of a cartesian
system placed on the mean plane of the object surface and f is the focal length
of the recording system. Lateral displacements do not appreciably alter these
values.

3

Collimated illumination is diﬃcult on extended objects. Gregory considered
a divergent illumination and showed that when the optical system is focused
on the plane than contains the image of the point source considering the object
surface as a mirror, then the speckle shift does not depend on in-plane dis-
placements, but only on out-of-plane tilts.8−10 Chiang and Juang described a
method to measure the change in slope by defocused systems.11 A great number
of later papers document the use of defocused speckle photography to measure
in-plane and out-of-plane rotations and strains.12−15 This paper describes a new
methodology that can be applied to almost all of them bringing advantages and
disadvantages that will be discussed.

After the double specklegram is obtained by addition (double exposure on
the same photographic ﬁlm) or subtraction (using a digital electronic camera),
a pointwise analysis or a whole ﬁeld ﬁltering can be performed in order to know
the lateral distribution of the displacement.16,7 The ﬁrst technique, illustrated
in Fig. 2(a), uses a narrow laser beam that is made to go through the speck-
legram. The diﬀraction pattern is modulated by fringes whose directions are
perpendicular to the speckle shift and whose spacing is

σ = λ

ξ
x + d2
d2
y

q

(3)

where ξ is the distance from the specklegram to the observation plane.

Whole ﬁeld ﬁltering, depicted in Fig. 2(b), uses a wide laser beam that goes
through the specklegram and is ﬁltered by a hole placed in a plane standing
before a focusing lens that reconstructs an image of the specklegram. Only
those areas whose modulated diﬀraction patterns do not have a dark fringe over
the hole, will appear illuminated on the image plane. Thus, dark fringes in the
detector can be mapped onto speckle shift values.

Today CCD cameras replace photographic ﬁlms and processing of speckle-
grams is progressively performed through digital techniques,17 although they
usually simulate the analogic ones.

3 Direct illumination system analysis

We will consider the Tiziani optical system adapted for normal illumination
represented in Fig.1. A laser source LS emits a light beam, that is expanded
by BE and spatially ﬁltered by SF. Half of the intensity goes through the beam
splitter BS and reaches the rough surface S. Part of the light scattered by S is
reﬂected by BS and recorded at the back focal plane R of the lens L1. We will
refer to this set-up as DDSP(direct defocused speckle photography) set-up. The
surface under observation is supposed to be a rough L × L square, placed at
a distance d from the objective lens of the optical system, measured along the
optical axis (dashed in Fig. 1). The aperture diameter of the system is D, its
focal length is f and the sensing area is a b × b square whose resolution width
is δ.

The relation

does not depend on the aperture.

By properly choosing the system aperture, the technique can improve the
measuring range or the lateral resolution. Although, according to the equations,
this versatility may seem feasible, speckle size considerations shrink the choice
possibilities. Speckle size can not be smaller than the detector cell, because
averaging destroys the speckle. On the other hand, there should be a large
number of speckles, in order to accurately track their displacements, what sets
an upper bound on speckle size. This limits the range of practical values for the
aperture of the system. Often speckle size is made approximately equal to the
detector cell size, so that

The main problem with the previously mentioned technique is its short range
of measurements. The optical aperture of the system must remain small so that
the speckle size is not smaller than the resolution of the CCD array. This fact
limits the out-of-plane rotations whose speckle shifts can be recorded by the
optical system.

4 Multi-windowed system analysis

The DDSP set-up described in the previous section can be modiﬁed by the
addition of a suitably perforated mask that enhances the adaptability of the
system to a wider range of measuring needs. Fig. 3 represents an optical
system where the laser source LS generates a beam which is expanded by a beam
expander BE and spatially ﬁltered through the pinhole SF. Then the collimated
beam is split into multiple collimated beams by a multi-windowed mask MWM,
which is shown in Fig. 4(a), with a rectangular array of perforated circular
holes of radius a (λ ≪ a). The beam splitter BS lets half of the light arrive at
the object surface S and reﬂects light from S into the aperture of the lens L1.
Finally a speckle pattern, as represented in Fig. 4(c), is recorded at the back

focal plane R of the lens. The focusing and recording optics are implemented
by an electronic CCD camera. We will refer to this set-up as MWDSP (multi-
windowed defocused speckle photography) set-up. Other arrangements of holes
are possible, although we will focus on the rectangular array depicted in Fig.
4(a), which is especially well suited for obtainig a square matrix γij = γ(i∆, j∆)
of tilts, where ∆ is the cartesian discretization step of the system. Equilateral
triangular arrangements, as seen in Fig. 4(b), can also be used and are better
than rectangular arrays when other parameters such as intensity eﬃciency or
lateral resolution are concerned (this is because the non-perforated area and
the distances between the centers of neighboring holes are smaller). Only the
rectangular system will be considered here, because for other arrangements the
analysis is practically identical.

We will now establish the main relations between relevant parameters of

determines the lateral resolution of the system and the width of the detector
area available for each, which then sets the maximum non-overlapping speckle
displacement or, equivalently, the tilt range.

If the object surface under observation and the sensing areas are L × L and
b × b squares respectively, then, as in DDSP, the distance from the object to the
camera, measured along the optical axis (dashed in Fig. 3), should be

5 Comparison

We are now going to compare the measuring range and lateral resolution of the
DDSP and MWDSP systems. Table 1 summarises the results derived in the
previous sections.

In DDSP there is the possibility to change the f-number F of the system.

As for most popular cameras, 1 ≤ F ≤ 20, then we have

and

so that the measuring range is only limited by the b

L relation.

In MWDSP, the aperture is related to Γ through the equation

and to the lateral resolution through

so that the system aperture relates identically to the measuring parameters in
DDSP and MWDSP. Thus

which mutually limits the measuring range and lateral resolution of the system
in both DDSP and MWDSP.

When considering the illumination power, it is straightforward to assert that
if the aperture is the same in both systems, then there is more eﬃciency in DDSP
than in MWDSP. In general, the relation of power at the detector is

When both apertures and speckle sizes are equal, the MWDSP power eﬃciency
is about 78.5% that of DDSP. If equilateral triangular arrays are used, this result
is slightly improved. However, under these conditions, the mean intensity within
the speckle circles in the MWDSP system and IDSP are equal. In MWDSP we
can increase the power at the detector by reducing either the measuring range
(and accordingly the aperture and lateral resolution) or the speckle size or both,
in order to get a similar intensity. Nevertheless, when the speckles in MWDSP
are larger than in DDSP, the intensity in the latter is always greater than in
the former. This is the main disadvantage of MWDSP that, in our opinion, is
outweighed by the considerations that follow.

If we now take into account that the resolution of the detector is δ there are
more restraints to be fulﬁlled. Speckles need to be at least as wide as δ so that
there is no averaging of speckles in the recorded picture. This poses a serious

11

limitation on DDSP since both its speckle size and measurement properties
depend on F ; however, in MWDSP, speckle size only depends on a, so that it
does not alter the choice range for F and keeps the ﬂexibility of the system
untouched. Moreover, there is no problem in reducing the value of a (as long as
we are far from λ) making speckles as big as desired. In fact the only restriction
on MWDSP is that

2N a ≤ L ⇒ sMW DSP ≥ 1.22λF

(40)

so that the a parameter can always be adjusted to generate speckles whose
size is 24.4λ which is far from making speckles too large, since generally δ is
not much smaller than 24.4λ.
In other words, for each value of F there is
a minimum size of speckle (1.22λF ) , which is always attainable by choosing
the maximum admissible a. Even for the maximum value of F , the minimum
obtainable speckle size is not too large for the usual resolutions of CCD cameras.

This consideration also applies for DDSP, since

sDDSP = 1.22λF

(41)

is in the F = 20 limit equal to 24.4λ which is not much bigger than δ.

Consequently, in practice, speckle size considerations only restraint the mea-
suring range of DDSP, leaving the lateral resolution limit around 0.05f . Besides,
the speckle size in MWDSP can be freely raised from the DDSP value to several
times δ by reducing the a parameter, without changing the system aperture.
This possibility makes that the DDSP limitation on the measuring range does
not hold for MWDSP.

Table 2 lists the measuring characteristics for both systems when δ = s.

Typical values for δ are in the vicinity of 10-20 microns, so that if L/b ≈ 5,
ΓDDSP is in the order of 10−3 radians for δ = 20 microns, whereas ΓMW DSP
can be up to b/(2L) ≈ 10−1 radians. Lateral resolution can be reduced up to
0.05f . Using a 20mm lens, the minimum ∆ is around 1mm for DDSP and
MWDSP.

6 Conclusion

By suitably varying the optical aperture, diﬀerent measuring ranges and lateral
resolutions are attainable in the DDSP-system, almost exactly as by varying
the N parameter in the MWDSP-system. However, the optical aperture in the
ﬁrst system has severe limitations on account of speckle size considerations. On
the other hand, in the MWDSP-system, speckle size is set by properly choosing
the a parameter independently from the selection of N . The main drawback
in MWDSP is its slightly poorer intensity eﬃciency, which is outweighed by its
beneﬁts in those applications where the DDSP measuring range falls too short.
MWDSP is especially well suited for use with bending plates, where large tilt
ranges are needed.
It could be mentioned, as yet another advantage of the
MWDSP-system, its adaptive potential. Work on masks with non-equal spacing
of holes is currently in progress, so that the measuring range and the lateral
resolution can be changed across the object, achieving a ﬁne lateral resolution
in some points of limited slope change values and a coarser lateral resolution in
points with greater expected slope changes. A second enhancement possibility is
the utilisation of multiple masks (before and after the transformation) in order
to increase lateral resolution and overcome the limiting relation (see Eq.(33))
that holds in both systems.

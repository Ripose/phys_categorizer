We study the energy propagation in subwavelength waveguides and demonstrate that the mech-
anism of material gain, previously suggested for loss compensation, is also a powerful tool to ma-
nipulate dispersion and propagation characteristics of electromagnetic pulses at the nanoscale. We
demonstrate that the group velocity in lossy nano-waveguides can be controlled from slow to super-
luminal values by the material gain and waveguide geometry. We also show that gain-assisted dis-
persion management can be used to control the transition between “photonic-funnel” and “photonic-
compressor” regimes in tapered nano-waveguides. The phenomenon of strong modulation of group
velocity in subwavelength structures can be realized in waveguides with diﬀerent geometries, and is
present for both volume and surface-modes.

Conventional optical ﬁbers support propagating modes
only when waveguide radius is suﬃciently large[1].
In
contrast to this behavior, plasmonic systems, anisotropy-
based waveguides, nanoparticle chains, and optical coax-
ial cables [2, 3, 4, 5] support energy propagation even
when the typical waveguide cross-section is much smaller
than the wavelength. Unfortunately, since the major-
ity of these nano-waveguides rely on plasmonic materials
to conﬁne the radiation beyond the diﬀraction limit, the
propagation of nano-constrained radiation is often lim-
ited by material losses. While the emerging ﬁeld of ac-
tive plasmonics [6] promises to overcome absorption lim-
itations in nano-waveguides, full compensation of losses
appears to be experimentally challenging[7].

In this Letter we focus on gain-assisted phenomena
beyond absorption compensation and study the perspec-
tives of controlling the dispersive properties of active
nanoscale waveguides. We show that even relatively weak
material gain, which is unable to compensate losses, is
capable of producing large variations of the group ve-
locity, bringing such exotic phenomena as slow (0 <
vg ≪ c) and ultra-fast (vg < 0) light[8, 9, 10] to the
nanoscale domain. However, in contrast to diﬀraction-
limited systems, where the group velocity is controlled
solely by material dispersion, the energy propagation in
nano-waveguides is also strongly aﬀected by the waveg-
uide geometry. We demonstrate that interplay between
geometry- and material-controlled modal dispersion in
tapered waveguides leads to the transition between pho-
tonic compressor regime, where the reduction of phase
velocity is accompanied by the simultaneous reduction
of group velocity [11, 12] and photonic funnel [13] regime
where the product of phase and group velocities re-
mains constant[1]. The developed formalism is illustrated
on the examples of two fundamentally diﬀerent nano-
waveguides: a surface-mode-based plasmonic nanorod,
and a volume-mode ﬁber with anisotropic core. Appli-
cations include nanosized tunable delay lines, all-optical
buﬀers and data synchronizers.

The geometry of a typical waveguide structure is
schematically shown in Fig. 1a. For simplicity, we as-
sume that the system is homogeneous along the propa-

gation direction (z axis) [14]; the transverse structure of
the waveguide is represented as a set of N layers with
diﬀerent permittivities. Any wavepacket, propagating in
such a structure can be described as a linear combination
of waveguide modes, with each such mode having its own
dispersion relation between propagation constant kz and
frequency ω.

To ﬁnd this relation, we ﬁrst represent the ﬁeld in
i-th layer by a linear combination of “incoming” and
“outgoing” (in radial direction) waves with the same z-
dependence, but diﬀerent structure across the layer (de-
scribed by parameters κi)[3]. We then relate the ﬁelds in
each layer to the ﬁelds in the neighboring layers through
the boundary conditions, leading to the waveguide ma-
trix M that relates the (complex) amplitudes of waves
in all layers. Since a waveguide mode corresponds to a
nontrivial solution of the system of algebraic equations
described by M, the modal dispersion equation can be

identical to those for 100% and 66% respectively due to the
conjugation symmetry of Kramers-Kronig relations.

The number of terms in the summations in Eq.(3) (the
length of ~κ) depends on the waveguide symmetry and
individual layer properties. Thus, when the system has
axial symmetry (see Fig. 1a), each layer with isotropic
permittivity adds one κ per “axial number” m, each layer
with uniaxial anisotropy adds two such terms, etc.

Eq. (3) can be used for an arbitrary waveguide ge-
ometry including planar, square, and circular systems,
and can be applied to plasmonic, coaxial, and volume
waveguide modes. To illustrate the developed formal-
ism we consider two axially-symmetric cylindrical nano-
waveguides: (I) a plasmonic nanorod in the dielectric
material, and (II) a waveguide with anisotropic core, also
known as photonic funnel [13].

In the case of

the plasmonic waveguide the z
component of the m-th cylindrical wave inside and
outside the metal nanorod can be represented by
Im(κ1r)eimφ+ikz z−iωt and Km(κ2r)eimφ+ikz z−iωt respec-
tively, with Im and Km being modiﬁed Bessel functions,
z − ǫ1,2ω2/c2. The boundary-matching tech-
and κ2

sion equations for the ﬁrst (m = 0) T M surface plasmon

FIG. 2: (color online) Group and phase velocities of an SPP
on metal nanorod in Rh6G methanol solution (see text) as
functions of gain, frequency (a,c) and radius (b,d). The radial
dependence is given at λ = 534nm, the wavelength one - at
R = 35nm.

When the nanorod radius is much smaller than the
free-space wavelength (R ≪ λ0), κ1,2 ∝ 1/R.
In this
regime the phase velocity of SPP is proportional to the
radius, the terms involving DSPP in Eq. (5) are propor-
tional to R3, while the remaining term is proportional to
R.

The dramatic eﬀect of material dispersion on the re-
lationship between the phase and group velocities is
now clearly seen. In the absence of material dispersion,
vgvp = const, and the decrease of phase velocity with
the radius is accompanied by the increase of group ve-
locity. This eﬀect, introduced for anisotropic waveguides
(see below)[13] is somewhat similar to the motion of un-
compressible ﬂuid through a funnel: the decrease of the
cross-section leads to the increase of the local speed [17].
Any non-vanishing dispersion, however, dramatically
changes this behavior and leads to the regime when both
vp and vg simultaneously vanish. This regime, that origi-
nates from the material dispersion of plasmonic compos-
ites, has been shown to yield slow light in nanoscale plas-
monic waveguides[11] and in adiabatic plasmonic energy
compressors[12].

The crucial point of our work is that the dispersion
of the dielectric core can be used to control the group
velocity of SPP by adjusting the term
in Eq. (5). This way the nanoplasmonic system switches
(cid:17)
between “photonic funnel” and “photonic compressor”
regimes. Note that the group velocity can be indepen-
dently controlled by either material dispersion or waveg-

uide radius. It is therefore possible to build plasmonic
systems with either “fast” or “slow” modes (see Fig.2),
or implement an adjustable gain mechanism to tune in
between these two regimes.
It is also possible to con-
struct a tapered plasmonic ﬁber, similar to that described
in[12], in which the packets would travel with superlumi-
nal speed at larger radii, and compress toward the small-
radius apex.

To further demonstrate this behavior and show the
control over the group velocity with the material gain
we model the dispersive properties of a silver nanorod

0.4µm−1, ω(0)1 = 12.82µm−1, γ2 = 0.2µm−1, ω(0)2 =
11.74µm−1 for Rhodamine [19]. We model the material
gain by ﬁxing A1 = 0.001 and adjusting A2 to gradually
change the corresponding resonance strength (to invert
the population one has to ﬂip the sign of γ). On the
microscopic level, this process corresponds to a gradual
increase of the population of the excited level of Rh6G
with respect to the ground-state population, achievable,
for example, by an external pump. The dependence of
the dielectric permittivity of Rh6G on the material gain
measured in percents of the excited state population is
illustrated in Fig. 1c.

The group and phase velocities of SPP at the Ag-Rh6G
interface are shown in Fig. 2. Note that the gain level
used in our work is relatively weak. Indeed, the phase
velocity is almost unaﬀected by the material gain (see
Fig. 2c,d). Furthermore, the imaginary part of ǫ2, and
of propagation constant k′′
z remain positive, indicating
that the gain is insuﬃcient to compensate SPP losses.
Both superluminal (vg < 0) and slow (0 < vg ≪ c)
light regimes can be identiﬁed in active nanoplasmonic
structures. We note that while the SPP mode remains
lossy, the total absorption in the fast- and slow-light re-
gions is relatively small. The corresponding parameter
|k′′

z /kz| . 0.05.
When the gain is close to 25%, the group velocity un-
dergoes the transition from superluminal to slow light at
a constant pumping level with varying nanorod radius.
Similarly, at R = 35nm, the superluminal to slow light
transition happens as a function of pumping, providing
almost unlimited control over the group velocity of SPPs
at the nanoscale.

FIG. 3: (color online) Group and phase velocities of the T M01
mode in anisotropy-based cylindrical subdiﬀraction waveg-
uide (see text) as functions of gain, frequency (a,c) and radius
(b,d). Radial dependence is given at λ = 534nm, the wave-
length one - at R = 35nm. Note, that the phase velocity is
negative.

To demonstrate universality of nanoscale group ve-
locity modulation with respect to waveguide modes,
we apply the developed formalism to another type of
subdiﬀraction waveguide - the photonic funnel. These
anisotropy-based systems support volume modes with ei-
ther positive or negative refractive index [20] and can be
easily integrated with diﬀraction-limited ﬁbers[13].
In
the simplest case of a T M01 mode in cylindrical geome-
try with uniaxial dielectric core with optical axis parallel
to the direction of mode propagation and perfectly con-
ducting metallic walls, Eqs. (1-2) become:

Similar to what has been shown earlier for SPP mode,
this expression represents the interplay between the “fun-
nel limit” vgvp = c2/ǫxy = const and the “compressor
limit” vgvp ∝ 1/κ2

1 ∝ R2.

Fig. 3 shows the behavior of the T M01 mode in the
waveguide with metamaterial core, consisting of alter-
nating (in z direction) layers of Ag and Rh6G. In our

computations we use Eqs.(7,8) to calculate the dielectric
constants of Ag and Rh6G, accompanied by the eﬀective-
medium technique to obtain the eﬀective permittivities
of the nanolayer material (see Ref.[3] for details).

Note that the phase velocity (as well as the eﬀective
refractive index) of the metamaterial photonic funnel is
negative[13]. Apart from the sign of vp, the propaga-
tion of volume mode in metamaterial structure (Fig. 3)
is similar to that of an SPPs (Fig. 2). Once again, one
can eﬀectively control the group velocity between ultra-
fast (vg < 0) and slow (0 < vg ≪ c) values in lossy
(|k′′
z /kz| . 0.08) nanoscale system by tuning the mate-
rial dispersion of the core or waveguide radius.

To conclude, in this Letter we demonstrated the pos-
sibility of versatile (from slow to superluminal) group
velocity modulation in sub-diﬀraction waveguides. The
developed formalism can be directly utilized in diﬀerent
waveguide geometries (planar, square, etc.), diﬀerent set
of materials (polar dielectrics, semiconductors, quantum
wells[21], quantum dots [22]), and scaled for UV, opti-
cal, IR, THz and microwave spectral regions. Finally, we
note that the strong modulation of group velocity can be
also achieved in fully-active (amplifying) media, where
it will be accompanied by loss-less or amplifying mode
propagation[6].

[14] Although our formalism does not directly apply to
nanoparticle chains since they rely on localized instead
of propagating excitations, our results can be extended
to these types of waveguides via incorporation of homog-
enization techniques (see for instance Ref.[15]).

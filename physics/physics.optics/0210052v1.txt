Hexagonal dielectric resonators and microcrystal lasers

(Dated: September 28, 2013)

We study long-lived resonances (lowest-loss modes) in hexagonally shaped dielectric resonators
in order to gain insight into the physics of a class of microcrystal lasers. Numerical results on
resonance positions and lifetimes, near-ﬁeld intensity patterns, far-ﬁeld emission patterns, and eﬀects
of rounding of corners are presented. Most features are explained by a semiclassical approximation
based on pseudointegrable ray dynamics and boundary waves. The semiclassical model is also
relevant for other microlasers of polygonal geometry.

INTRODUCTION

A novel class of microlasers based on nanoporous
molecular sieve host-guest systems has been fabricated
recently by Vietze et al. [1]. Organic dye guest molecules
were put into the channel pores of a zeolitic microcrys-
5 host. The aluminophosphate-crystals grow
tal AlPO4 −
with natural hexagonal boundaries with a high degree of
perfection. In terms of pump energy needed to reach las-
ing threshold these microlasers can compete with semi-
conductor based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.
This makes them a promising candidate for future appli-
cations as e.g. optical communication devices.

Microlasers and microresonators are not only relevant
for experiments and applications but they are also of
great interest from a theoretical point of view because
they are open (or leaky) and they can be mesoscopic. In
our case the latter depends on the lasing dye and on the
crystal size. Both introduce a characteristic length scale:
the wavelength λ ranging from 600nm to 800nm, and the
side length R of the hexagonal cross section of the crystal
ranging from 2.6µm to 4.6µm in Refs. [1, 2]. In current
experiments, larger crystals with R up to 20µm are under
investigation. Only the ratio of these two length scales
is relevant. It can be expressed by the dimensionless size
parameter 20
190, where k = 2π/λ is the free-
space wave number. For small kR the wavelength and the
cavity size are of the same order. The system is micro-
scopic. For large but ﬁnite kR the system is mesoscopic.
The theoretical analysis of the lasing modes reduces
to the two-dimensional problem of resonant modes in a
passive dielectric microresonator of regular hexagonal ge-
ometry (ignoring surface roughness). In Ref. [2] prelimi-
nary numerical computations of the full wave equations
have been restricted to the near-ﬁeld intensity pattern.
We present a systematic numerical analysis of the hexag-
onally shaped dielectric resonator with 20
60,
including resonance positions and lifetimes, near-ﬁeld in-
tensity patterns, far-ﬁeld emission patterns, and eﬀects
of rounding of corners. To avoid convergence problems

at corners, which had been a problem in Ref. [2], we will
employ the boundary element method (BEM) [3].

To study the deep mesoscopic regime kR > 60 we will
introduce a semiclassical ray model. The semiclassical
(short-wavelength) approximation is applied in the ﬁeld
of quantum chaos to relate quantum (wave) dynamics
to their underlying classical (ray) dynamics. Most re-
search eﬀorts have been focused on closed resonators, so-
called billiards, where the dielectric interface is replaced
by a hard wall on which the wave function vanishes. The
classical dynamics is free motion inside the billiard with
specular reﬂections at the boundary.

The regular hexagon belongs to the class of rational
polygonal billiards. All angles αj between sides are ra-
tionally related to π, i.e. αj = mjπ/nj, where mj, nj > 0
are relatively prime integers. If all mj are equal to unity,
for example in the case of the rectangle, then the dy-
In the presence of critical cor-
namics is integrable.
ners with mj > 1 the dynamics is not integrable but
instead pseudointegrable [4]. As for integrable systems
the phase space is foliated by two-dimensional invariant
surfaces [5, 6]. However, there are some peculiar fea-
tures that distinguish these billiards strongly from inte-
grable ones (and also from fully or partially chaotic bil-
liards): (i) an invariant surface does not have the topol-
ogy of a torus but instead that of a surface of higher
genus [4], loosely speaking, a torus with additional han-
dles; (ii) the dynamics is not quasiperiodic. This is re-
ﬂected, for example, by multifractal Fourier spectra of
classical observables [7, 8]; (iii) the quantum-classical
correspondence is exotic [9]; (iv) the quantum spectrum
obeys critical statistics [10]. To compute the quantum
spectrum of a pseudointegrable billiard with a semiclas-
sical treatment is extremely diﬃcult, if possible at all. In
the present paper, we will demonstrate that for a suﬃ-
ciently open hexagonal dielectric resonator the spectrum
and the eigenmodes can be computed semiclassically. As
a byproduct, we gain an intuitive understanding of the
numerical results.

The paper is organized as follows. The system is de-
ﬁned in Sec. II. Section III presents the numerical analy-
sis. The semiclassical ray model is introduced in Sec. IV.
Finally, Sec. V contains our conclusions.

It is conventional to approximate lasing modes in an
active cavity by resonant modes in a passive cavity; see
e.g. Ref. [11]. Recently, numerical evidence has been
provided that in most cases the diﬀerence is indeed neg-
ligible [12].

In the experiments on the microcrystals it has been
shown that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is TM polarized [1,
2]. Maxwell’s equations reduce to a two-dimensional
wave equation [13]

2ψ = n2(r)k2ψ ,

− ∇

(1)

with wave number k and piece-wise constant index of
refraction n(r). The index of refraction is n = 1.466
inside the cavity and 1 outside. The origin of the coor-
dinate system r = (x, y) = (r cos θ, r sin θ) is located in
the center of the hexagonal cavity. The complex-valued
wave function ψ represents the z-component of the elec-
tric ﬁeld vector Ez(r, t) = ψ(r) exp (

ψ are continuous at the boundary of the res-
onator. To model the situation in a laser, we impose the

for large r. With a real-valued n (passive resonator
without absorption) this leads to modes that are expo-
nentially decaying in time. The lifetime τ of these so-
called resonant modes or short resonances is given by
1/2c Im(k) with Im(k) < 0. The lifetime τ is re-
τ =
lated to the quality factor Q = Re(ω)τ . The resonant
modes are connected to the peak structure in scattering
spectra; see e.g. Ref. [14]. We are here only interested
in long-lived resonances that provide a suﬃciently long
lifetime for the light to accumulate the gain required to
overcome the lasing threshold. Note that extremely long-
lived resonances are not relevant for lasers because they
do not supply enough output power.

The b-modes cannot be converted into each other since
each b-mode is invariant under 60◦-rotations up to a

ners of the resonator slightly as depicted in Fig. 2. In

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

A frequently used numerical method to solve wave
equation (1) with outgoing-wave condition (2) is the
wave- or mode-matching method [16]. The wave function
is expanded in integer Bessel functions inside the cav-
ity and in Hankel functions of ﬁrst kind outside, so that
the outgoing-wave condition (2) is fulﬁlled automatically.
The Rayleigh hypothesis asserts that such an expansion
is always possible. However, it can fail for geometries
which are not suﬃciently weak deformations of a circu-
lar cavity [17]. So, using the mode-matching method
for the hexagonal resonator in Ref. [2] is questionable.
And indeed, according to Ref. [18], serious convergence
problems appear in this situation. To avoid this problem
we apply the BEM [3]. Exploiting Green’s identity, the
two-dimensional diﬀerential equation (1) is replaced by a
one-dimensional integral equation deﬁned only along the
boundary of the cavity. To be slightly more precise, the
boundary appears twice in the formalism: one bounds
the interior of the cavity and one bounds the exterior.
The boundaries are then discretized by dividing them
into 2N small boundary elements. For the boundary (4)
we choose the following discretization

θ = ξ + η sin [6(ξ + π/2)] .

(6)

The discretization points on the circle ξ
[0, 2π) are cho-
sen to be spaced equidistantly. The parameter η deter-
mines the distribution of points on the cavity (the shape
of which is completely determined by the rounding pa-
rameter s). η = 0 gives an uniform density of points

A. Resonance positions in the complex plane

Figure 3 shows the total cross section σ as function
of the dimensionless wave number kR [Im(kR) = 0]
for plane-wave scattering with incidence angle θ = 15◦.
For numerical details of how to compute this quantity
[3]. We observe a single-mode spectrum, a
see Ref.
series of roughly equidistant peaks (the ﬁne structure
around kR
24.5 is an artifact of the BEM which can
be removed by increasing the number of discretisation
points [3]). We will label the peaks by the mode index
(or quantum number) m according to increasing kR. The
ﬁrst peak at kR
20.5 in Fig. 3 is labeled by m = 23.
This oﬀset will be motivated later. The position of a
given peak α and its width γ in Fig. 3 are related to the
complex value of kR of the corresponding resonant mode
by means of kR

iγ/2.

The BEM cannot only solve the scattering problem but
it also can compute the resonant modes.
In Fig. 4 we
plot the real and imaginary part of kR of a resonance as
function of the rounding parameter s. Re(kR) saturates
around s = 55, whereas Im(kR) saturates at s
100. We

take s = 100 translating to ρ/λ
0.11. It is surprising
that one has to decrease ρ to values one order of mag-
nitude smaller than the wavelength. In the following we

we have to change s accordingly.

accessible regime but also in the full experimental regime.
Relation (7) implies that the lifetime is proportional to
Re(k)R2 and the quality Q is proportional to Re(kR)2
(Q ranges from roughly 70 to 6400). This ﬁnding is rel-
evant for the future experiments on microcrystal lasers:
it implies that the laser threshold decreases as the size of
the resonator is increased.

Due to the qualitative change in behaviour around
34 in Figs. 5 and 6(b) we distinguish the re-
Re(kR)
gions Re(kR) < 34 and Re(kR) > 34. We refer to the
former one as the microscopic regime and to the latter as
the mesoscopic regime.

to compare to the ray dynamics. We remark that the

tical microcavities (see e.g. Ref. [19]) does not provide
more insight in our case.

θi = 60◦ > θc (with sin θc = 1/n) is trapped within the
hexagonal resonator by total internal reﬂection at the
facets; see Figs. 12 and 13 (some aspects of the much sim-
pler case n < nmin have been studied in Ref. [22]). The
periodic ray is marginally stable with respect to shifting
it along the boundary.
In this way we obtain a whole
family of periodic rays with identical length and angle of
incidence.

The upper bound nmax = 2 ensures that triangular-
shaped periodic rays with 30◦ angle of incidence are not
totally reﬂected. The periodic-ray family with θi = 60◦ is
then the only long-lived family of short period. Yet, since
periodic rays are dense in phase space, we cannot exclude
the possibility that there are also long-lived periodic rays
of high period.

It should be emphasized at this point that the (inﬁ-
nite) long lifetime of the rays is relevant for our purpose,
whereas the periodicity of the rays is not relevant. The
latter comes in here simply because periodic rays (and
their neighborhood) can be long-lived. We will not apply
methods from semiclassical periodic-orbit theory [23].

The periodic rays are unstable with respect of chang-
ing the angle of incidence. Figure 12 shows a ray with
slightly diﬀerent initial angle of incidence. The ray is
slowly diverging from the central one. After some time,
it reaches the corner on its other side at (almost) nor-
mal incidence. Consequently, it then escapes refractively
(with probability close to 1).

three steps: geometric optics, semiclassical quantization
and emission mechanisms.

it behaves as if it were in a closed resonator, i.e.

of the open system in terms of the invariant surface of the
hexagonal billiard. The genus of the invariant surfaces is

N
is shown schematically in Fig. 14. The topology is the
same for all initial conditions. First, we consider the spe-
cial case where the surface is foliated by periodic orbits.
Each periodic ray with θi = 60◦ appears here as two
disjoint circles with diﬀerent sense of rotation. These
two circles correspond to the two unidirectional travel-
ing waves. In the following we will focus on the circle
with clockwise rotational sense. On the same invariant
surface we ﬁnd also periodic rays of “bouncing-ball” type
with angle of incidence θi = 0◦. In the open system, the
bouncing-ball rays are not long-lived since they are not
totally reﬂected.

The dynamics on a generic invariant surface in the
neighborhood of the special surface discussed above is
as follows. A nonperiodic ray starting near the central
periodic ray with slightly diﬀerent initial angle of inci-
dence stays in the vicinity of the central ray by winding
around the handle many times. Finally, it has to leave
the vicinity of the periodic ray since pseudointegrable
motion is ergodic on generic invariant surfaces [24]. Be-
fore the ray can reach another handle (in the grey region
in Fig. 14) and perform complicated dynamics, it escapes
refractively from the cavity. Hence, the suﬃciently open
resonator does not see the complicated topology of the
full invariant surface but just two disjoint tori. In this
sense, the openess moves the system closer to integrabil-
ity. That is the reason why we can derive in the following
subsection a practical semiclassical approximation for the
open hexagonal resonator whereas this is impossible for
the hexagonal billiard. That is contrary to our intuition,
in that we expect that open systems are more diﬃcult to
treat than closed ones.

FIG. 14: Invariant surface of the hexagonal billiard. The small
circle on the left (right) hand side represents the central periodic
ray in Fig. 12 cycling (counter-) clockwise. In the grey region the
condition for total internal reﬂection is not fulﬁlled.

B. Semiclassical quantization

Having identiﬁed the long-lived part of classical phase
space, we now quantize it in a semiclassical approxima-
tion. This approximation is valid for small 1/Re(kR)
and it does include interference eﬀects, in contrast to the
geometric-optics limit.

Because of the absence of stability of the periodic rays
the conventional approach in laser optics, the paraxial
approximation (see e.g. Ref. [25]), does not work. Never-
theless, the semiclassical quantization is simple. The idea
is that an integer number m = 1, 2, 3, . . . of wavelengths
λinside = λ/n = 2π/nRe(k) ﬁts on the path length of the
long-lived ray shown in Fig. 12, taking into account the
phase shifts at the dielectric boundary. It will turn out
that the number m deﬁned in this way is identical to the
mode index m as used in Sec. III.

To compute the phase shifts we consider the text-book
treatment of reﬂection of a plane wave at an inﬁnitely
extended dielectric interface as illustrated in Fig. 13; see
e.g. Ref. [26]. This simpliﬁed setup is justiﬁed if λ

Observation of Figs. 7(c) and (d) shows that the “nodal
lines” close to the boundary of the cavity are not ex-
actly parallel to the boundary but slightly tilted (about
5◦). This angular shift decreases as one goes to higher-
excited modes. For example, it is not visible by eye in
Fig. 8. Specular reﬂection of a plane wave at the bound-
ary leads always to nodal lines parallel to the boundary.
Hence, it is reasonable to interpret the angular shift as
a kind of non-specular reﬂection. The angular shift can

stricted to the boundary is a periodic function. Because
of the periodicity, the Fourier spectrum of the wave func-
tion along the boundary is discrete. The discrete peaks
can be related to a discrete set of allowed angles of in-
cidence. The angle θi = 60◦ typically falls between two
neighboring discrete angles. In Sec. A in the Appendix
we compute the angular shift analytically to ﬁrst order

the angular shift vanishes. Our angular shift

is diﬀerent from those cases discussed in the context of
non-specular reﬂections (see e.g. Ref. [27]), in that it
happens above the critical angle of total internal reﬂec-
tion. Moreover, it has nothing to do with the angular
Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect (see e.g. Ref. [28]), which is the
Goos-H¨anchen shift at a curved interface.

The fact that our model predicts a single-mode spec-

trum, a one-parameter m = 1, 2, . . . family of long-lived
resonances, is related to the fact that there is only one
long-lived family of periodic rays (with short period).
There is no “transversal mode index” which would be
expected if the paraxial approximation were applicable.
Higher transverse modes correspond to rays with angle
of incidence considerably diﬀerent from 60◦. They are
much shorter-lived which becomes clear in the following
subsection when we discuss the emission mechanisms.

What are the mechanisms for this decay of intensity?
Obviously, there is no classical mechanism. In the frame-
work of ray optics, the periodic rays in Fig. 12 remain
forever in the cavity. Hence, we have to include explic-
itly wave eﬀects. We identify three candidates of such
wave eﬀects, all of which are related to the corners. The
ﬁrst one is diﬀraction at corners. Corner diﬀraction may
be a emission mechanism since a wave with ﬁnite wave-
length coming close to a corner is diﬀracted partly to the
exterior and partly back into the interior with another
spectrum of directions for which the condition of total
internal reﬂection may not be fulﬁlled at the next reﬂec-
tion. We will argue that corner diﬀraction is important
for the emission directionality but not for the escape rate.
For the escape rate we ﬁnd two new relevant eﬀects which
are responsible for transport to corners. We call them
boundary-wave leakage and pseudointegrable leakage.

The boundary-wave leakage is illustrated in Fig. 17.
An evanescent boundary wave travels along an inﬁnitely

extended dielectric interface from
sume that at a ﬁnite interface the boundary wave fully
separates from the interface at the corner. In Sec. B in
the Appendix we determine the outgoing relative inten-
sity for any regular polygon (equilateral triangle, square,
hexagon, ...) due to boundary waves. In particular, for
the hexagon we ﬁnd

The pseudointegrable leakage is due to the fact that
wave optics does not realize exactly θi = 60◦ as already
mentioned and shown in Sec. A in the Appendix. Putting
this small angular deviation ∆θ into the initial condi-
tions gives raise to rays with ﬁnite lifetime due to the
pseudointegrable dynamics; see Fig. 12. In Sec. C in the

(22)

The derivation can be easily extended to any regular
polygon. Cavities with integrable internal dynamics, like
the equilateral triangle and the square, have ∆Ip = 0.
That means the neighborhood of the long-lived family of
periodic rays has roughly the same lifetime than the pe-
riodic rays. In such a case, we expect a multimode spec-
trum in the mesoscopic regime.
Indeed, this has been
found in scattering experiments on the dielectric square
in Ref. [29].

Remarkably, both contributions in Eqs. (21) and (22)
have the same dependence on Re(k). In either case, the
contribution vanishes in the limit Re(k)

For n = 1.466 we ﬁnd Im(kR) Re(kR)

in Eqs. (24)-(27) to the numerical data as function of

the semiclassical approximation, some are only roughly
described. The latter cases correspond to the strong ﬂuc-
tuations around the semiclassical hyperbola (24) already
visible in Fig. 5.

structure is related to the geometry of long-lived rays; see
Fig. 12. The envelops of the emission direction are de-
scribed by the boundary-wave leakage and the pseudoin-
tegrable leakage; cf. Figs. 8, 10 and 12. The distribution
within the envelops is not predicted by our model. Here,
corner diﬀraction is important because both the bound-
ary waves and the pseudointegrable ray dynamics lead to
escape arbitrarily close to the corner.

Our ray model gives a natural explanation for the
sensitivity to rounding of corners. Let us assume that
a suﬃciently small rounding only slightly weakens the
loss due to boundary waves, whereas it reduces corner
diﬀraction strongly. Numerical simulations of ray dy-
namics in rounded hexagons show that the periodic rays,
see Fig. 12, are stabilized. This statement is indepen-
dent on the particular chosen boundary parametrization.
Hence, there is no pseudointegrable leakage. This leads
to considerably larger lifetimes and emission parallel to
the facets; compare Figs. 8-11.

V. CONCLUSION

We have discussed the properties of long-lived reso-
nances in hexagonally shaped dielectric microcavities.
These microcavities play an important role for experi-
ments on a class of microcrystal lasers [1, 2].

The numerical analysis revealed the following facts: (i)
The resonance positions in the complex plane are approx-
imated by a hyperbola. This fact is relevant for future ex-
periments on microcrystal lasers because it implies that
the laser threshold is lower for larger crystals. (ii) The
near-ﬁeld intensity pattern show a whispering-gallery-like
structure. (iii) The emission is at corners in agreement
with the experiments. (iv) The emission is directed. The
high-intensity directions are not parallel to the facets. (v)
The lifetimes and the emission directionality are sensitive

10

to rounding of the corners.

The numerical analysis does not cover the full exper-
imental regime. To overcome this limitation, we have
introduced a semiclassical approximation which can be
easily extended to any cavity of regular polygonal ge-
ometry. Our semiclassical ray model contains two new
leakage due to boundary waves
emission mechanisms:
and due to the pseudointegrable ray dynamics. Explicit
expressions for the resonance positions can be given even
though the system is not integrable. The semiclassical
approximation explains all numerical ﬁndings (i)-(v) in
an intuitive way, except the emission directionality. To
describe the directionality properly it is necessary to con-
sider corner diﬀraction in the future.

Our results are not only relevant for microcrystal lasers
but also for other kinds of polygonal-shaped microlasers.
To name a few: hexagonal lasers with attached op-
tical waveguides based on semiconductor heterostruc-
tures [30], hexagonally shaped solid polymer dye mi-
crocavities [31], equilateral-triangular laser cavities fab-
ricated from semiconductor heterostructures [32], and
square laser micropillar cavities based on dye-doped poly-
mers [33].

APPENDIX A: ANGULAR SHIFT

In this section we discuss the semiclassical deviation of
the angle of incidence from 60◦. Let us ﬁrst investigate
and ++-modes. Along the boundary, these modes
−−
are periodic with period 3R, i.e. ψ(s + 3R) = ψ(s),
where the arclength s
[0, 6R) parametrizes the bound-
ary. Hence, the wave function along the boundary can
be expanded as the following Fourier series

APPENDIX B: BOUNDARY-WAVE LEAKAGE

In this section we compute the leakage due to boundary
waves. To estimate the loss we consider the total inter-
nal reﬂection (θi > θc) of a plane wave at an inﬁnitely
extended dielectric interface; see Fig. 13. This consider-
ation is justiﬁed if Re(kR)
1 and θi not to close to the
≫
critical angle for total internal reﬂection θc. Since θe is a
complex number in Eq. (11), the wave in the lower-index
region is evanescent, i.e. it decays exponentially with in-
creasing distance from the boundary; see Fig. 17. Along
the boundary the evanescent wave propagates with con-
stant velocity. The corresponding total energy (or better
intensity) ﬂux at a given point at the boundary can be
computed by means of

LEAKAGE

Here we compute the pseudointegrable leakage. We
put the angular shift ∆θ from Eq. (A5) into the ini-
tial conditions for the ray dynamics. Elementary geom-
etry, see Fig. 12, shows that after one round trip, i.e. 6
bounces, the angular deviation gives rise to the spatial

Abstract

We present scattering from many body systems in a new light. In place of the usual
van Hove treatment, (applicable to a wide range of scattering processes using both
photons and massive particles) based on plane waves, we calculate the scattering
amplitude as a space-time integral over the scattering sample for an incident wave
characterized by its correlation function which results from the shaping of the wave
Instrument resolution eﬀects - seen as due to the loss of
ﬁeld by the apparatus.
correlation caused by the path diﬀerences in the diﬀerent arms of the instrument
are automatically included and analytic forms of the resolution function for diﬀerent
instruments are obtained. Each element of the apparatus is associated with a corre-
lation length (or time). These correlation lengths, determined by the dimensions of
the apparatus are generally much smaller than these dimensions and larger than the
wavelength. As is well known, these are the conditions for the validity of geometri-
cal optics so that the conventional treatment, where the scattering is calculated by
the van Hove plane wave approach and the trajectories through the instrument are
treated classically, is usually valid. In the present approach analytic expressions for
the correlation functions are obtained. The intersection of the moving correlation
volumes (those regions where the correlation functions are signiﬁcant) associated
with the diﬀerent elements of the apparatus determines the maximum correlation
lengths (times) that can be observed in a sample, and hence, the momentum (en-
ergy) resolution of the measurement. This geometrical picture of moving correlation
volumes derived by our technique shows how the interaction of the scatterer with
the wave ﬁeld shaped by the apparatus proceeds in space and time. Matching of the
correlation volumes so as to maximize the intersection region yields a transparent,
graphical method of instrument design. PACS: 03.65.Nk, 3.80 +r, 03.75, 61.12.B

1 Introduction

The usual treatment of scattering from many particle systems assumes the initial
beam to be represented by a plane wave and shows that the scattering cross section
is proportional to the Fourier transform of the correlation function of the density
ﬂuctuations. For inelastic (energy changing) scattering this is the van Hove time
dependent correlation function, in the case of elastic scattering it is the static pair
distribution function [1]. The usual treatment then integrates the cross section for
monochromatic plane waves over the spread of momentum in the incident and scat-
tered beams.

In this work we show that another approach is both possible and interesting. As
we do the entire calculation in real space-time our approach sheds new light on the
emergence of the Fourier transform in the scattering cross section. A crucial feature
of our approach is that the inﬂuence of beam preparation on the resolution of the
measurement is expressed by the correlation volume of the incident beam, which in
turn, is determined by the optical (in the sense of normal [2] and time dependent [3]
optics) properties of the beam preparation elements, e.g. slits and choppers.

We will see that the lateral width of the beam correlation volume determines
the possible spatial extent of the correlations which can be observed in a given ex-
periment, and is inversely proportional to the q resolution, as in the conventional
treatment. The longitudinal extent of the beam correlation volume or the correla-
tion time of the incident beam likewise sets the limit to the system correlation times
which can be observed. The correlation volume Vc is the conjugate volume to the
momentum space volume Vp and VpVc ≈ ~3.

In a previous work [4] we have discussed the neutron spin echo spectrometer
[5] from a similar point of view. We have shown that in that case the equivalent
correlation volume is split longitudinally by the ’spin echo time’, τNSE, which can be
much longer than the correlation time of the incident beam. This splitting of the
correlation volume results in the fact that the spin echo spectrometer measures the
time dependence of the scattering system correlation function directly. When the
incoming beam correlation volume is continuous (not split), then the scattered wave
is an integral over all space-time separations falling within the correlation volume of
the incident beam and the result is the Fourier transform of the space-time correlation
function of the scattering system as will be seen below.

1.1 Correlation functions and scattering

The concept of correlation (coherence) volume has been applied to visible light optics
for more than 50 years including such problems as the eﬀect of the illumination on
the resolution of a microscope . The correlation properties of a beam as a result of
the optical properties of its preparing devices are known as the van Cittert-Zernike
theorem [2], [6] and [7] and we will see how this can be applied to both time -
dependent and -independent scattering.

A frequently used technique for deconvoluting the instrument resolution from the
measured data is to use the Fourier transform of the resolution function [8]. In the
present work we show the physical signiﬁcance of that Fourier transform and show
how it is determined by the optical properties of the beam. It has been shown in [8]
that this Fourier transform may contain more information than e.g. the width of the
resolution function. In fact it is the correlation function at long distances and times
that is often of the greatest importance. An additional feature of our treatment is
that the instrumental resolution is seen as an integral part of the experiment not
something that is put in ad hoc after the calculation.

It is well known that scattering experiments depend only on the spectrum

of the incident beam and hence can be considered as the incoherent superposition

(cid:12)
of the results of experiments done with plane waves distributed according to this

spectrum. This is easily seen in the context of the present work where we show
that the scattering cross section depends on the auto-correlation function of the

incident beam. The Fourier transform of this auto-correlation is

have been

For these reasons we feel that it is more convenient to talk about correlation volumes
rather than coherence volumes as has been the practice in optics [2] since it seems
reasonable to reserve the term coherence for those cases where
plays an important role.

(cid:17)E
The correlation length δc discussed here and in section 3 has real physical mean-
ing (as of course does its equivalent the spectral width ∆k). This can be seen by
considering that in order to observe the famous two slit interference pattern (Young)
it is necessary to illuminate the two slits with correlated radiation. This is normally
produced by having the two slits located in the main peak of the diﬀraction pattern
produced by a third slit up-stream from the pair producing the interference pattern.
The van Cittert- Zernike theorem is the rigorous expression of this point. The two
point correlation function can be measured with such a double slit experiment by
measuring the modulation (visibility) of the interference pattern as a function of the
slit separation. Of course the physical situation can be described according to the
spectral viewpoint, where the incident beam is considered as an incoherent superpo-

the concept of a coherence (correlation) length is very useful for understanding this

In the following we shall see that these ideas have a rigorous basis. We have

presented the main features of these ideas with some physical examples in [13].

1.2 Examples of correlation lengths and times

We now discuss two simple examples to show the magnitudes of the correlation
lengths (times) introduced by the shaping of the wave ﬁelds produced by the optical
elements of the apparatus. As formulated by Marathay ”..the ﬁeld from a non-
coherent (uncorrelated) source acquires coherence (a ﬁnite correlation length) by the
very process of propagation.” (see [14], p.105.) This is nothing else than what occurs
when a random ’white noise’ signal acquires a ﬁnite correlation time as a result of
passing through a low pass ﬁlter, something which can easily be observed with an
oscilloscope.

For elastic scattering, a beam collimated with slits of width a separated by a

2

distance L, will have an angular width of ∆θ ∼ a/L and a spread in momentum per-
pendicular to the beam of ∆ky ∼ kx∆θ ∼ kxa/L. This will result in an uncertainty
in momentum transfer q of ∆q ∼ ∆ky.

On the other hand, seen according to quantum mechanics, a beam going through
a slit of width a will have an uncertainty in momentum ∆k′
y ∼ 1/a and this will
result in a lateral spreading over a distance δ ∼ ∆k′
yL/kx = L/kxa at a distance L in
the x direction. We see that the correlation length δ ∼ 1/∆q so that both arguments
will lead to the same resolution. In order to put the argument on a ﬁrmer footing we
need to show that a wave acquires a correlation length δ on passing through a slit of
width a. δ is the length associated with a Fraunhofer diﬀraction pattern of a slit. The
problem is then to show that this length can arise in the case of Fresnel diﬀraction
(ﬁnite distance L). This is the content of the van-Cittert Zernike theorem ([2], [6],
[7]) mentioned above. In this way we can describe the scattering process in terms of
diﬀraction at the deﬁning slits and the correlation length of the incident beam. We
will be able to describe the scattering in real space instead of in the Fourier transform
space deﬁned by −→q .

For a small angle scattering instrument with wavelength of 10 Angst. and colli-
mating slits 2cm wide separated by L = 10m the correlation width will be about
1600 Angst., i.e. much larger than the wavelength but much smaller than the slit
width. Correlations over larger distances than this cannot be observed with the
assumed instrument.

(cid:0)

~ω = E = mv2/2

Applying the same argument to a chopper for massive particles we see that
for a chopper opening T and time of ﬂight to we will have ∆E/E = 2T /to =
∆ω/ω,
by the usual classical arguments. Quantum mechani-
cally, according to the uncertainty principle, passing through a chopper of width
T will result in a spread of energy given by ∆ω′ ∼ 1/T and this spread in energy
will result in a spread in arrival times ∆t/to ∼ ∆v/v ∼ ∆ω′/2ω ∼ 1/2ωT . Thus we
should expect a correlation time of ∆t ∼ to/2ωT ∼ 1/∆ω. For a time of ﬂight instru-
ment with pulse width T = 10−5s and a ﬂight path of L = 5m, neutron wavelength
λ = 5 Angst. we obtain ∆t ∼ 30ps and this is the limit to the correlation times which
can be observed with such an instrument.

2 A new look at scattering from many particle systems

We will now show how the eﬀects discussed above are contained in a quantum-
mechanical calculation of the scattering. Following the usual treatment of scattering
[9], sec. 2.1, [15] the scattered wave is given by

ψsc (−→r , t) =

Go (−→r − −→rs , t − ts) V (−→rs , ts) ψsc (−→rs , ts) d3rsdts

(1)

Z

where ψsc (−→rs ) is the exact solution for the wave function at the position −→rs , and Go is
the Green’s function for the unperturbed problem (V = 0). The notation is explained
in ﬁgs. 4 and 6. As is usual in van Hove scattering we make the Born approximation
by replacing ψsc (−→rs ) by the incident wave at the position of the scattering sample,
ψin (−→rs ) and take (for the case of neutron scattering)

The integration is carried out over the sample volume and the time interval during

which the sample is exposed to the beam.

Equation (3) describes the scattered wave as a superposition of waves produced by
many scattering events each occurring at the diﬀerent space time points (−→rs , ts)(Fig.
1). This is in contrast to the usual van Hove treatment [1], where one begins with
the Fermi golden rule for time dependent perturbations and shows, replacing the
energy conservation delta function by its Fourier transform, that the probability of
scattering is given by the space-time Fourier transform of the correlation function of
V (−→rs , ts). In the appendix to [4] we have shown how one can derive the van Hove
result in a more direct way. Introducing −→rs − −→rs
s = τ we have from (3)

Although (11) contains an explicit dependence on only space and time variables,

the variation of the phases of the Go functions.

Now we see there is a symmetry between the integral over the detector parame-
ters, (−→rd , td), of the product of Green’s functions depending on (−→r2 , t2), Rout

In this paper we limit ourselves to pure coherent scattering. The separation of
the scattering into a coherent and an incoherent part can be carried out exactly as in
the conventional treatment. [1], [9]. Also in the interests of simplicity we choose to
work with a real ’hydrodynamic’ density function ρ (−→r , t). Replacement of this by
i δ (−→r − −→r i(t)) yields results consistent with the conventional approach [1], (see

The result (16) is known as the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, [2], [6], [7] and
has the form of the Fraunhofer formula. Note that this formula is applicable to
geometries where one would not normally observe a Fraunhofer diﬀraction pattern,
except in the case of a spherical wave converging on the point of observation. In
applications to optics the phase factors in (16), depending on the position of the pair
of points with respect to the center of the sample, as well as on the distance between
them are often neglected so that the correlation functions can be considered as real
functions depending only on the distance between the two points. However the phase
factors play a crucial role in scattering, bringing in the inﬂuence of the sample size on
the resolution and the dependence on the energy and momentum transfer, as shown
below.

In the present case this factor means that moving the location of the

an additional diﬀerence in the two optical paths going from the entrance slit to

For a, b, d small, corresponding to a high −→q resolution, the functions in square

The same result is obtained if we take the incident and outgoing states as plane
waves. The result of an experiment for non-negligible a, b, d must then be found
by taking the convolution of (21) with an instrumental resolution function. In the
approach of (20) however, the resolution is contained in the (loss of) correlation
functions in the square brackets. Equ. (20) clearly shows how correlations between
points in the sample separated by larger values of δ contribute less to the intensity.
However due to the nature of the sin x/x functions there are some contributions to the
scattering from these larger values, and some regions of δ contribute with a negative
sign. These eﬀects, at the 10% level, which do not appear if we approximate the
sin x/x functions by Gaussians of an appropriate width as is often done in practice,
become more important for measurements at poor resolution such as in quasi-elastic
line broadening.

We see that equ. (20) is the Fourier transform with respect to

with a function H (a, b, δy) which is itself the product of three functions,h2

S (−→q ), with the Fourier transform of H. The latter is the
form of G

(r1/k is a normalizing factor so that ηa (qy) is normalized to 2a and u (x) is the unit

replaced by (d/r2). The convolution of two rectangular functions in qy, ηa and ηb,
yields a trapezoid with a base bounded by

and a top bounded by

|qy| < k (a/r1 + b (1/r1 + 1/r2))

|qy| < k |a/r1 − b (1/r1 + 1/r2)| ,

just what is expected on geometrical grounds for a collimator consisting of two slits
of width 2a and 2b separated by a distance x as seen by a point rd away from the
second slit (see ﬁg. 5). The subsequent convolution with ηd (qy) yields the eﬀect of
ﬁnite detector width. From (20) the correlation length of the input function h1 is
seen to be yc = r1/ka, while (22) gives the width yq in q, to be yq = ka/r1. Hence
yc · yq = 1 or yc · yp = ~, where the momentum width yp = ~yq.

Thus our result (20) is identical with the usual treatment which yields the convo-
lution of S (−→q ) with the resolution function but our view of the scattering is quite
diﬀerent. We see the scattering process as the interaction with the sample of a state
whose wave function has a certain spatial auto-correlation function determined by
the optical properties of the devices used to deﬁne the incoming beam. This has the
eﬀect that only pairs of scattering points whose separation is less than the correlation
length of the incident beam contribute signiﬁcantly to the scattered wave and pairs

deconvoluting the instrument resolution from the measured data. However, in the
work cited no mention is made of the physical signiﬁcance of the Fourier transform
of the instrument resolution function (our H (δ) is called R (k) in ([8])) as the (loss
of) correlation functions of the incident and scattered wave functions. In the above
treatment we see how the resolution function is the result of the optical properties
of the devices deﬁning the incident and scattered beams.

Similar considerations have been used by many people (e.g.

3.1.2 Discussion of the result for small angle scattering

In the previous section we have seen that the contribution to
from the
correlation function of the incident beam represents the eﬀect on the resolution due
to the collimation of the incident beam and the correlation function of the scattered
beam results in that part of the resolution due to the angular resolution of the
scattered beam. Each element of the optical system deﬁning the beam is seen to
contribute a factor to the overall correlation function.

3.2.1 Discussion

Just as in the small angle case the result in the general case (28) is seen as the Fourier
transform of the product of Gs with a product of functions, each representing the
contribution to the resolution of an individual element of the beam handling system.
Corresponding to the sin x/x functions in one dimension the function J1 (x) /x in
two dimensions represents a square shaped resolution in q but in the latter case the
resolution is a function of |−→q | rather than a component of −→q in the one dimensional
cases.

The term involving (δya) gives the inﬂuence of the width of the entrance slit (2a)
on the resolution; it depends on r1 but not on r2. The term in (δy′ d) gives the
inﬂuence of the detector slit width (2d) on the resolution and depends on r2. The
remaining term gives the inﬂuence of the sample size and depends on r′ because an
uncertainty in position at the sample eﬀects the angular resolution in both arms.

The argument of each term can be written as (δ/δci) where the δci are correlation
lengths corresponding to the size of the correlations that can be observed with a
given installation. When any of the terms is small, so is the contribution to the total

δ for which
integral, so that the only signiﬁcant contribution comes from values of
each term in (29) is signiﬁcant. Thus the resolution is determined by the overlap of
the diﬀerent correlation volumes and the measurement can be optimized by choosing
all regions as approximately equal.

Equ. (28) has been derived for the case of a single incident energy. It is easy to see
that if we took an incident spectrum constant in a region ±∆K that the result will
be an additional term sin x/x with x = ∆K (δ1 − δ2), where δ1,2 are the components
−→
of
δ along the directions of k1,2 respectively. A more detailed discussion including
the inﬂuence of the scattering angle will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

In [4] we have described various forms of spin echo spectrometer from a space-
time point of view. According to this picture the ﬁrst arm of the spectrometer
causes the beam incident on the scattering sample to be split in space and time, and
this splitting results in the scattered beam sampling the scattering system at points
separated by this splitting. In this section we show how the current view point yields
the same results.

We note that we are considering only scattering with −→q =

iqy. In the case of

spin echo the wave function:

Ψ inc (−→r ) =

represents the beam arriving at the sample in the absence of the NSE magnetic ﬁeld.
Turning on the ﬁrst spin echo ﬁeld (length L) introduces a phase shift which ’splits’
the beam on the sample [4]. Calling the components of the split beam on the sample

4 Scattering from a time dependent system

In the present section we will show how the ideas presented in the previous section
can be applied to scattering from systems ﬂuctuating in time. In scattering from such
systems the energy of the scattering radiation is changed (inelastic or quasi-elastic
scattering). For simplicity, in this section we will neglect the position dependence of
the scattering, considering the scattering system to be concentrated at a single point,
−→rs and restrict ourselves to massive particle scattering where the energy is deﬁned by
choppers.3 This is equivalent to calculating the scattering integrated over all values
of −→q . We will treat the case of time and position dependent scattering in the next
section.

Under these restrictions equ. (1) can be written:

ψsc (−→rd , td) =

dtsGo (−→rd − −→rs , td − ts) V (−→rs , ts) ψin (−→rs , ts)

(38)

for the wave function at the detector located at −→rd at time td where

m|−→rd
2~(td

−ts)

(39)

is the Green’s function (neglecting an unimportant prefactor) for the time dependent
unperturbed Schr¨odinger equation.

The beam will be taken to be incident on the scatterer through a slit (chopper)
located at the origin that opens during the time interval −T ≤ to ≤ T . (See ﬁg. 6
for a deﬁnition of the notation used here.) Analogous to the elastic case above, we
consider the wave function incident on the chopper to be completely uncorrelated
for diﬀerent values of to. That is, we assume that the correlation time of the beam
incident on the chopper is much shorter than the correlation time that will be imposed
on the beam by the action of the chopper, or, in other words, the beam incident on
the chopper contains a much broader energy spectrum than will be selected by the
chopper system.

The wave function leaving the chopper and arriving at a point −→rs at time ts is

given by [17], [18], [3]

The term eiµξs comes from the phase factor which is normally neglected in optics.
In the present case this factor has the eﬀect that moving the correlation interval (τ )
(varying ξs) in (42) causes an additional diﬀerence in the two optical paths going
from the entrance chopper to the detector chopper via the two points separated by
τ , i.e. the paths 1 and 2 in ﬁg. 6). This deﬁnes the inﬂuence of the sample chopper
width (2Ts) on the resolution.

where we have written Gs (τ ) for hρ (−→rs , ts) ρ∗ (−→rs , ts − τ )is the time dependent density-
density correlation function of the scattering system.

Thus the scattering cross section is found to be proportional to the Fourier trans-
form of the density-density correlation function of the scattering system multiplied
by a function of τ which is the product of three functions representing the eﬀects of
the opening times of the three choppers on the resolution of the measurement. In
this case the scattering is seen as the interaction of the incoming state with the time
ﬂuctuations of the scattering system. The wave function of the incoming state has
an auto-correlation function determined by the (time-dependent) optical properties
of the deﬁning choppers. Only pairs of scattering events separated by times τ , less
than the correlation time of the incoming wave contribute to the scattered wave and
their contribution is weighted by the beam auto-correlation function evaluated at τ .

14

4.1 Discussion

The situation represented by (45) is completely analogous to the elastic scattering
case (28). The opening times T1,2 inﬂuence the resolution by an amount depending
on t1,2 respectively, while Ts contributes to the uncertainty in the travel times in both
arms and depends on a weighted combination of the two travel times. The argument
of each term can be written as τ /τci where the τci are diﬀerent correlation times.
Clearly the measurement will be optimized when all the τci are approximately equal.

α1 and β1 represent the inﬂuence of the input slit and chopper on the overall
resolution, µ and ν the inﬂuence of the sample size and chopper while α2 and β2
represent the eﬀects of the detector slit and time resolution.

Each of these variables has a term proportional to τ and a term proportional to δ.
Keeping in mind the Fourier transform (69) we see that the terms proportional to τ
will give the energy resolution and those proportional to δ will give the q resolution.
Thus, for example, the τ term in α1 represents the eﬀects of the ﬁrst chopper opening
time, To, on the energy resolution just as in the pure time dependent case, equations
(43, 45) while the δ term represents the eﬀect of the ﬁrst chopper width on the

q resolution, i.e. the chopper width results in an uncertainty in
k 1 that gives a
contribution to the q resolution. Similar remarks hold for each of the terms in (72).

We see that our approach yields directly the mutual inﬂuence of the q and ω reso-
lutions in a compact analytic form. Since each element of the apparatus is associated
with a deﬁnite factor in H, we see directly the inﬂuence of the individual elements on
the overall resolution. Modiﬁcation of these elements can readily be accommodated
as shown in the next section.

If we wish we can follow the more usual procedure of replacing each term by
a Gaussian function with the appropriate width. This then allows an easy way to
estimate the overall width of the ω, q resolution (given by the convolution of the
Fourier transform of each term in H) as the square root of the sum of the squares
of the widths of each term and shows that the optimum is when all the widths are
equal.

Each factor in (71) is associated with a certain velocity in

space so that
the relevant correlation volumes can be considered as moving as a function of τ . For
example the volume associated with α2 is moving with a velocity −→v 2, the nominal
velocity of the scattered wave. Thus we see that the coherence volume associated
with the detector parameters can be considered as consisting of the region limited by
±~t2/md in the δ′
y direction and ±t2/Tdk2 in the δx′ direction, moving (as function
of τ ) with velocity v2 in the x′ direction (direction of the scattered beam). Each of
the other pairs of terms contributes a similar moving limit to the region of
space.

In a forthcoming work we will present a detailed discussion of the shapes and

5.2 Entrance slit with moving edges

We now modify the above treatment to consider the more realistic case where the
chopper slits move with ﬁnite speed. See [3] for discussion of a related problem.
We consider that the slit width depends on the time to, at which the beam passes
through the slit in the following manner:

18

where a is the maximum opening of the slit (which occurs at to = 0) and θ = a/T1.
Then we rewrite equ. (62) as

The rest of the calculation proceeds as above so the only change in the result is to
replace the sin x/x functions depending on a, To and their associated prefactors in
(71) with the function in square brackets in (76). The correlation function (76) is

δ along the direction of the incident beam and δy its

where vs is the velocity of the slit boundary. For non-zero τ the slope of the lines
stays the same but the crossing point moves along the δx axis with a velocity v1. The
correlation volume for the input beam, i.e. the overlap region where the two factors in
(76) are signiﬁcant, is thus seen to be given by a complex interplay between the slopes
of the lines and the widths of the sin x/x functions which depend on the correlation
lengths δyc = L1/k1a, δxc = t1/Tok1, and the correlation time τ = t1/2ω1To.

This is a demonstration of some of the advantages of the present method, show-
ing how a change of a component can be easily accommodated and how complex
relationships between the energy and momentum resolution can be represented in a
straight forward manner.

6 Conclusions

Starting with Fermi’s ’golden rule’ for perturbation theory and assuming the inci-
dent and ﬁnal wave functions of the scattered particles to be plane waves, van Hove
[1] showed that the scattering cross section is proportional to a function of the mo-
mentum and energy transfer, S (q, ω), which in turn is the Fourier transform of the
time and space dependent auto-correlation function of the density ﬂuctuations of the
scattering system.

However since no experiment is ever done with perfect resolution, measurements
yield the convolution of S (q, ω) with an instrument resolution function. The deter-
mination of the resolution and its use in the interpretation of the data are left to the
experimenters.

In this conventional approach a scattering experiment is divided up into two
separate parts which are treated by two, diﬀerent, mutually exclusive approximations.
The scattering event in the sample is treated by assuming inﬁnitely extended plane
waves for the incident and scattered beams, while the beam is treated as consisting
of classical point particles in order to describe its motion through the apparatus.
This same, dual approach is also used to discuss multiple scattering: the scattering
events are described as a scattering of plane wave states while the motion between
two scattering points is treated as a classical trajectory. We hope to present a uniﬁed
treatment of multiple scattering using the present approach in the near future.

In the present work, the entire scattering experiment is described as a wave-
optical phenomenon. This more general approach provides a rigorous justiﬁcation
for the usual dual approximation since, in most cases the correlation volumes are
much smaller than the geometrical dimensions (beam cross sections, chopper pulse
lengths, etc.) involved. However in some cases this is not true and the complete wave-
optical description of the global system of instrument and scattering sample must
be used.
In addition to precision light scattering experiments such cases include
perfect crystal neutron optics (e.g. interferometry) where the deﬁnition of the wave
vector is so precise that the correlation lengths can be comparable to the geometrical
dimensions. These cases are sometimes referred to as ”spherical wave eﬀects”[19]. In
fact these eﬀects are natural consequences of the full wave-optical analysis presented
here.

Usual methods of determining the resolution include measurement of a known
calibration sample, Monte Carlo calculations and estimates based on assuming a
Gaussian form for the separate contributions to the overall resolution so that the
separate contributions can be combined using the sum of squares rule.

One method of carrying out the deconvolution is to divide the Fourier transform
of the measured data by the Fourier transform of the resolution function. Usually
however a model form is assumed for S (−→q , ω) and some parameters of the model
are varied until the convolution with the resolution function gives agreement with
the measured data.

In the present work we calculate the incoming wave function as it is shaped by
transmission through the elements of the apparatus according to the laws of optics.
For example on propagating through a slit and/or a chopper a wave acquires a corre-
lation function with a ﬁnite width. After scattering, the individual waves scattered
from a neighboring pair of points in the sample lose correlation on passing through
the post-sample elements of the apparatus. We have shown that the probability of
a scattered particle arriving at a detector at a given space-time location is propor-
tional to the Fourier transform of the density ﬂuctuation auto-correlation function
(as shown by van Hove) but multiplied by a function H
which represents the

resolution of the measurement and is the Fourier transform of the instrument resolu-
tion as it is normally considered. This function is the product of a series of functions,
each representing the eﬀect of a single element of the apparatus on the measurement.
Changes in one element can be easily accommodated by changes in the appropriate
function. The regions of
space where each function is signiﬁcant are the
correlation volumes for the diﬀerent elements of the apparatus. A measurement can
be optimized by maximizing the region of overlap of all the correlation volumes. The
fact that these volumes are seen to be moving as a function of the correlation time τ ,
is a reﬂection of the fact that the ω, and −→q resolutions depend on each other to some
extent and we have an analytic description of this dependence. The present analysis
oﬀers a graphical method of optimizing each measurement, with the inﬂuence of all
parameters such as the scattering angle included.
In a forthcoming work we will
give detailed examples of how this can be carried out for various types of scattering
measurements.

7 Appendix - Normalization and calculation of cross sections

In the main text we have neglected all prefactors and normalizing constants in the
Green’s functions and incident wave function. In this appendix we will show how
inclusion of these factors leads to the usual expression for the cross section and give
a proper calculation of ψin as mentioned in footnote 2 of section 2. We will treat the
most general case of space and time dependent density ﬂuctuations (sec. 5).

Fig.1) Scattering in ﬁrst Born approximation (equ. 3). The incoming wave is
scattered at −→r s and the scattered wave propagates according to Go. The Green’s
function (39) has the property that at a ﬁxed time the wavelength decreases with
distance from the source.

Fig. 2 a) The incident wave ﬁeld, initially uncorrelated, emerges from the entrance
slit with correlations over a length scale d, inversely proportional to the slit width,
a.

2 b) Showing the phase relations responsible for the correlations of the wave
ﬁeld according to the van Cittert-Zernike theorem. Waves emerging from the uncor-
related point sources a, b, c arrive at the scattering points rs, r′
s with diﬀerent relative
phases. The phase diﬀerence of the waves arriving at the diﬀerent scattering points
from each source point depends on the location of the source point as well as the
−→
δ . This increasing phase diﬀerence leads
distance
to a decrease in correlation between the waves arriving at the points rs, r′
s. Because
the phase diﬀerences between the uncorrelated source points are random they have
no inﬂuence on the correlation function.

Fig. 3) Illustrating equ. (11). The functions Rin, Rout represent the eﬀects of the
phase diﬀerences between the paths 1 and 2 on the correlation functions of the beam.
Gs is the correlation of the density ﬂuctuations at the diﬀerent scattering points and
|ψd|2 is the sum of the contributions from paths going through all possible pairs of
points in the sample. Only pairs whose separation lies within the correlation volumes
contribute.

Fig. 6) Scattering from a time dependent system. The scatterer is assumed to
be concentrated at a single point (−→r s). The resolution is determined by the phase
diﬀerence between paths (1) and (2). Note the analogy with elastic scattering - ﬁg.

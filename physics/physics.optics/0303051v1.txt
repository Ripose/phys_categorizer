We study eﬀects of ﬁnite height and surrounding material on one-dimensional photonic crystals
with Fourier- and ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain simulation methods. We consider linear and nonlinear
materials. Band structures of resonant modes are calculated and diﬀerent types of bands identiﬁed.
The band gap is shown to be strongly modiﬁed by the boundary material. As an application we
suggest reﬂection and guiding of light by patterning the boundary material. Optimal slab heights
and boundary materials for all-optical switching are discussed.

PACS numbers: 42.70.Qs

If photonic crystals are to be used in integrated op-
tics they are demanded to have as small size as possi-
ble and eﬀects of ﬁnite size will be essential.
In this
letter we consider photonic crystal slabs of heights h of
the order of the period P . The eigenmodes of a thin
photonic crystal slab can be identiﬁed as Wood’s anoma-
lies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Slabs of two
dimensional photonic crystals are considered for example
in Refs. [14] and references therein. We study diﬀerent
types of boundary materials above and below the one-
dimensional photonic crystal slab. Varying the boundary
material is shown to result in large changes in the band
structures. We suggest that this eﬀect can be utilized for
reﬂecting light by changing the boundary material.
In
two-dimensional photonic crystals, the same eﬀect could
probably be used for guiding of light by patterning the
boundary material. We also study the eﬀect of nonlin-
earity on diﬀerent kinds of resonant modes. The use of
the slab height and boundary material for optimizing all-
optical switching performance is discussed.

The considered geometry is shown in Fig. 1. The one-
dimensional photonic crystal is a periodic stack of dielec-
tric materials, which have diﬀerent dielectric constants.
As light traverses the structure (y-direction in Fig. 1), it
reﬂects from each layer and interferes resulting in a band
structure. We consider a polarization with ﬁeld compo-
nents Hx, Ey, and Ez.

We use two simulation methods: a Fourier-method
to calculate the eigenmodes and band structures of the
photonic crystal and a ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain
(FDTD) method to study light propagation in the struc-
ture. The Fourier-simulation method is described in
Refs. [15, 16]. Maxwell’s equations assuming harmonic
time dependence for the ﬁelds are used. The ansatz
for the spatial ﬁeld distributions is a Fourier-series in
the direction of periodicity (y in Fig. 1) Hx(y, z) =
Pn Hn(k, ω, z)eikny and Ey(y, z) = Pn En(k, ω, z)eikny,
where k is the wave vector and kn = k + 2πn/P .
In
the direction of the ﬁnite height (z in Fig. 1) we assume

FIG. 1: Geometry of a one-dimensional photonic crystal slab.
The crystal is assumed to be inﬁnite in x- and y-directions
but have a ﬁnite thickness h in z-direction. The parameters
are thickness of the layer l/P and height of the crystal h/P
relative to the period P , and dielectric constant of the mate-
rial ε (the other material is air). Materials above (z > h) and
below (z < 0) can have any dielectric constants.

[H(k, ω, z), E(k, ω, z)] =
exponential dependence,
i.e.,
eλz[ ˜H(k, ω), ˜E(k, ω)], where the coeﬃcients Hn(k, ω, z)
and En(k, ω, z) are presented as a vector [H, E] =
[H−N , ..., H0, ..., HN , E−N , ..., E0, ..., EN ]. Here λ has to
be understood symbolically as the eigenvalue of the eigen-
value problem resulting from the Maxwell’s equations
with this ansatz. The (4N +2) solutions λm and the
corresponding eigenvectors vm describe the ﬁeld depen-
dence on z. The coeﬃcients for the ﬁelds take the form
[H, E]T = Pm Cmvmeλmz. The eigenvalue problem is
solved in the photonic crystal region as well as above and
below the crystal separately leading to three sets of eigen-
values and eigenvectors. The coeﬃcients Cm for the three
regions are determined from the interface conditions at
z = 0 and z = h. Nonlinear eﬀects are achieved itera-
tively. In the nonlinear calculations the photonic crystal
has to be divided into several regions in the z-direction
each of them having only y-dependent dielectric constant.
The eigenvalue problem is solved separately in each re-
gion and interface conditions are imposed at all the inter-
faces between the regions. The ﬁelds are normalized by
keeping the integral of the energy density over one period
constant.

In the case of a ﬁnite height slab the band structure

consists of resonant modes, which are the (k, ω)-solutions
with maximum conﬁnement inside the photonic crys-
tal [10]. Thus the band structure is calculated by solving
the ﬁeld distributions using the Fourier method as ex-
plained above for several values of k and ω. The resulting
ﬁeld distributions are then integrated over one period in
the photonic crystal area (0 < z < h, −P/2 < y < P/2).
Maximas of the integral across the (k, ω)-space form the
band structure. We take into account frequencies above
and below the light line.

Two types of resonant modes (called Wood’s anoma-
lies) are found: Rayleigh modes and resonance modes.
Rayleigh modes are associated with emergence of a new
diﬀraction order and thus they are a consequence of
the periodicity of the material. Resonance modes ap-
pear when a waveguide type of a mode is excited in
the periodic structure, and they are essentially a con-
sequence of the ﬁnite height of the slab. Modes appear-
ing above the light line of the surrounding medium are
leaky modes with a ﬁnite lifetime. Leaky modes have
imaginary eigenvalue(s) λm in the regions above and/or
below the photonic crystal. The coeﬃcient Cm corre-
sponding to the imaginary eigenvalue λm determines the
coupling strength of the eigenmode out of the photonic
crystal to that radiating component (∼ eλmz). Leaky
modes have ﬁnite lifetimes, but as we are considering a
dynamic application and wish not to permanently conﬁne
light inside the structure, this loss mechanism is permis-
sible. Rayleigh modes are identiﬁed among the maximum
conﬁnement solutions as those k points where one more
eigenvalue λm of the photonic crystal region becomes
imaginary with increasing ω. Rayleigh modes are a prop-
erty of the photonic crystal geometry. Thus a Rayleigh
mode, although a mode associated with a diﬀraction or-
der, can exist also under the light line of the surrounding
medium. In that case it just does not have a radiative
component in the surrounding medium to couple to.

In the band structures shown in Fig. 2 the photonic
crystal geometries are the same, only the surrounding
material is diﬀerent (see ﬁgure caption). Rayleigh and
resonance modes are identiﬁed in the band structures.
Resonance modes are strongly dependent on the bound-
ary material in contrast to the Rayleigh modes. We found
that in case (a) the resonance modes are at least an order
of magnitude stronger by conﬁnement inside the photonic
crystal slab, and by coupling to outside when above the
light line, than Rayleigh modes.
In case (b), however,
the situation is opposite, and in case (c) both types of
modes are of the same strength. This is understandable,
because in case (a) the slab acts as a planar waveguide
with a higher average refractive index than the surround-
ing material, whereas in case (b) the situation is opposite.
The parity of the ﬁeld distributions Ez and Hx with re-
spect to the center of the slab in the z-direction is marked
in the cases (a) and (b). In case (c) the modes do not
have parities as the reﬂection symmetry with respect to

FIG. 2: Band structures of linear photonic crystals with dif-
ferent boundary materials: air (ε = 1), GaAs (ε = 13), and
air above/dielectric below in (a), (b) and (c), respectively.
Dashed curves are Rayleigh modes and solid curves are reso-
nance modes. Geometry parameters are: l = 0.2P , h = 0.5P ,
and ε = 13. The area above the light line of the surrounding
medium is shaded. Modes in the shaded area are leaky modes.
Letters e and o denote even and odd bands, respectively.

the plane parallel to the slab is lost.

As an application of this phenomena we can see from
the two-dimensional FDTD simulations that light reﬂects
as we change the boundary material (see Fig. 3(a)). Part
of the light is diﬀracted to the boundary material that
has a high dielectric constant. This is illustrated in Fig.
3(b), where the reﬂected energy density along the pho-
tonic crystal slab is calculated as a function of the dielec-
tric constant of the boundary material using the FDTD
method. We can see that with increasing dielectric con-
stant of the boundary material more light is reﬂected
along the photonic crystal slab (indicating that for a to-
tally reﬂecting boundary material such as metal the eﬀect
would be ideal). This and other properties of the crystal
and its boundaries can be used to optimize the reﬂection.
For photonic crystal slabs periodic in two dimensions, we
suggest to use this eﬀect for guiding of light by pattern-
ing the boundary material — an alternative way for light
guiding along crystal defects. The eﬃciency of this type
of guiding will be investigated in another publication.

Nonlinear one-dimensional photonic crystals could be
used for all-optical switching as the band structure
changes dynamically depending on the light intensity in-
side the photonic crystal. In all-optical switching a probe
beam can be reﬂected dynamically by using a high inten-
sity control beam which changes the dielectric constant of
the nonlinear material. We consider Kerr-nonlinear ma-
terial which means that the dielectric constant depends
linearly on the light intensity εnl(y, z) = ε + χ(3)I(y, z).
Various numerical simulations, e.g., [16, 17] and exper-
iments have been performed in this area of research.
Experiments have used for example silicon [18], and
GaAs [19] as the nonlinear material. We use GaAs as our
model material. Kerr coeﬃcient for GaAs is χ(3) = −0.2

FIG. 3: (a) Energy density proﬁles of a Gaussian pulse in a
photonic crystal slab at diﬀerent times. The proﬁle is taken in
the middle of the photonic crystal. Photonic crystal geometry
is shown in the upmost part of the ﬁgure. The black areas de-
note GaAs and white areas denote air. The pulse has a scaled
frequency ωP/(2πc) = 0.3. This frequency has a guided res-
onance when boundary material is air, but falls into a band
gap when boundary material is GaAs. This can be seen from
the intensity proﬁle as the pulse is reﬂected. (b) The fraction
of the energy density of a Gaussian pulse that is reﬂected
inside the slab from the point where the boundary material
above and below the photonic crystal slab changes from air to
a material with dielectric constant εb. The rest of the energy
of the pulse is diﬀracted into the boundary material. Solid
line indicates dielectric boundary materials and dots indicate
metals: gold, silver, and aluminum for which the refractive
indices are nAu = 0.053 + 7.249i, nAg = 0.078 + 7.249i, and
nAl = 0.384 + 11.88i, respectively.

cm2/kW for wavelength 0.84 µm [20].

Band structures for nonlinear photonic crystals are
shown in Fig. 4. In order to have a large nonlinear eﬀect,
the intensity of the light that is inducing the nonlinearity,
i.e., control plane wave has to be as much as possible con-
ﬁned inside the nonlinear material. Thus the frequency
of the control plane wave is chosen from a band that has
such a mode distribution. Also, the height of the slab
is optimized in order to have the best possible conﬁne-
ment of control light inside the nonlinear material. As the
height is varied the higher frequency resonance modes are
aﬀected most and new resonance modes appear. How-
ever, there is an upper limit for optimal height as the new
modes ﬁll up the band gaps. The nonlinear eﬀect can be
further optimized by the choice of the boundary material.
When the dielectric constant of the boundary material is
increased, the number of resonance modes decreases, but
on the other hand the existing modes are found to have
an increasing conﬁnement of the electric ﬁelds inside the
nonlinear material. No diﬀerence is found in the way
the Rayleigh and resonance resonances are aﬀected by
the nonlinearity. As a general rule the higher frequency
bands change the most indicating that they could be used

FIG. 4: Band structures for nonlinear photonic crystals.
Dashed curves are Rayleigh modes and solid curves are res-
onance modes. Dotted curves are the band structure for the
linear photonic crystal of the same geometry. In (a) the ge-
ometry is as in Fig. 2 except that the ε = 13 material is
nonlinear with χ(3) = −0.2 cm2/kW. The frequency of the
control light inducing the nonlinearity is chosen from the sec-
ond resonance band (ωP/(2πc) = 0.7), which is found to have
the strongest conﬁnement in the nonlinear material for the ge-
ometry. The intensity is I = 13 kW/cm2. In (b) the height is
increased to h = 0.7P . Then a new resonance mode appears
(ωP/(2πc) = 0.93) that has even stronger conﬁnement than
the one used in case (a). The intensity is I = 11 kW/cm2.
The constant intensity values correspond to the intensity that
the control plane wave would have in free space. The intensity
distribution of the eigenmode is normalized in each iteration
step to have the same energy density as this plane wave.

in all-optical switching.

We have studied the eﬀect of boundary materials and
ﬁnite height of one-dimensional photonic crystals to the
band structure and eigenmodes. We used a Fourier
method and a ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain method.
Boundary materials considered were GaAs, air, and
mixed cases on top/below the photonic crystal. In lin-
ear photonic crystals the band structure shows depen-
dency on the boundary material. Diﬀerent types of Wood
anomalies behave diﬀerently as the boundary material is
changed. The resonance modes are most aﬀected by the
change of the boundary material. This can be used to re-
ﬂect light by changing the boundary material and prob-
ably even for novel type of guiding of light. The eﬀect of
slab height and boundary material was also studied for
nonlinear photonic crystals, having in mind optimization
of the all-optical switching performance.

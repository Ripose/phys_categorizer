Abstract

We examine a spatial evolution of lightwaves in a nonlin-
ear photonic crystal with a quadratic nonlinearity when
simultaneously a second harmonic and a sum-frequency
generation are quasi-phase-matched. We ﬁnd the condi-
tions of a transition to Hamiltonian chaos for diﬀerent
amplitudes of lightwaves at the boundary of the crystal.

Wave mixing in nonlinear optical materials is a basis
of modern optical sciences and technologies. Cascad-
ing several wave-mixing processes in the same low-loss
material one can in principle achieve a high eﬃciency
using a large value of the lowest-order optical nonlin-
earity. The theoretical investigations of cascading of
several scalar optical three-wave-mixing processes in the
bulk materials with χ(2) nonlinearity has a long history
[1]. In particular, Akhmanov and co-workers have found
the eﬃciency of a third harmonic generation (THG) via
cascading of a second harmonic generation (SHG) and
a sum-frequency mixing (SFM) in a quadratic medium
[2], while Komissarova and Sukhorukov have described
an eﬃcient parametric ampliﬁcation at a high-frequency
pump in the same system [3]. Obviously, the observation
of these nonlinear eﬀects demands a simultaneous sat-
isfaction of phase-matching conditions for several para-
metric processes as perfectly as possible. On other hand,
it has been shown later that the systems, for which sev-
eral optical wave-mixing processes can be simultaneously
phase-matched, are in general nonintegrable; therefore a
competition of two (or more) parametric processes can
often result in a chaotic spatial evolution of lightwaves
[4, 5]. However, until nowadays it was unclear how to
achieve a phase-matching for several processes in homo-
geneous medium employing traditional techniques, such
as using a birefringence in ferroelectric crystals.

The solution of this problem has been found rather re-
cently [6, 7, 8]; it consists in an introduction of the diﬀer-
ent types of artiﬁcial periodicity of a nonlinear medium
resulting in a formation of nonlinear 1D and 2D super-
structures termed optical superlattices [9] or nonlinear

photonic crystals (NPCs) [10]. In NPCs there is a pe-
riodic (or quasiperiodic) spatial variation of a nonlinear
susceptibility tensor while a linear susceptibility tensor
is constant.

In these engineering nonlinear materials a phase mis-
match between the interacting lightwaves could be com-
pensated by the Bragg vector of NPC. The idea of such
kind of quasi-phase-matching (QPM) was introduced by
Bloembergen and co-workers many years ago [11]. How-
ever, only recently the rapid progress in a fabrication
of high quality ferroelectric crystals with a periodic do-
main inversion made the QPM method very popular
[9, 12]. We should stress that the conditions for QPM
may be fulﬁlled for several wave-mixing processes simul-
taneously; the QPM also has an advantage as using of
largest nonlinear coeﬃcient.

Nowadays there are several experiments on an obser-
vation of third and fourth harmonics in diﬀerent peri-
odically or quasiperiodically poled ferroelectric crystals
with χ(2) nonlinearity [7, 13, 14], which clearly demon-
strate an importance of multiple-mixing in NPCs for the
potential applications. Modern theoretical activities on
the nonlinear lightwaves interactions in NPCs are mainly
focused on the studies of strong energy interchange be-
tween the waves [12] (this is a development of the earlier
activities [2, 3]), as well as on the formation of spatial
optical solitons [15].

In this work we describe a novel for the physics of
NPCs eﬀect of Hamiltonian optical chaos. Namely, we
show that spatial evolution of three light waves, par-
ticipating simultaneously in SHG and SFM in the con-
ditions of QPM, is chaotic for many values of complex
amplitude of the waves at the boundary of χ(2)-NPC.
There also exists an integrable limit when the evolution
of waves is always regular regardless of absolute values
of their complex amplitudes. The integrable limit corre-
sponds to the particular values of two combinations of
wave phases at the boundary of nonlinear medium. In
particular, the problem of THG belongs to the integrable
limit, therefore in the conditions of recent experiments
[7, 13, 14], nonlinear light dynamics should be always
regular. However, even a rather small change in ampli-
tudes and phases of waves at the boundary of crystal, in
respect to those considered in [7, 13, 14], should result

corresponding to the conservation of energy of nonin-
teracting waves. In a general case the system (3) does
not have other global integrals of motion, thus it is non-
integrable and should demonstrate chaotic dynamics for
many initial conditions al(0) [17, 18]. However, for some
values of ξ and some speciﬁc initial conditions, an addi-
tional local integral of motion can arise. Let us list these
cases because they include the physically important sit-
uations.

First, if one of the parametric processes, either SHG or
SFM, is dominant (ξ
1), then an additional
1 or ξ
integral of motion arises, which is of the Manley-Rowe
type [12]. Second, nonlinear dynamics is strongly depen-
dent on the initial values of two “resonant phases” ψ2(0)
and ψ3(0), where

namics is always regular. Moreover, using approaches of
Refs. [3, 19], it is possible to show that an additional local
motion integral exists in this case [20]. In particular, the
problem of THG (a1(0) = 1, a2(0) = a3(0) = 0) belongs

2

to this class of initial conditions. Therefore, the spatial
dynamics of lightwaves at THG is regular (cf Ref. [21],
where an analytic solution has been found).

We have performed an intensive search of chaotic tra-
jectories solving the equations of motion (3) numerically
for two characteristic values of control parameter ξ that
correspond to the experimental situations described in
works [7] and [13], correspondingly:

To distinguish regular and chaotic dynamics we com-
pute the maximal Lyapunov exponent λmax for the dif-
ferent values of initial lightwave’s amplitudes, α, and
phases, φ. For chaos λmax > 0, in contrast λmax = 0
for a regular motion [18]. The dependence of λmax on
α for the ﬁrst order QPMs (set I) is depicted in Fig. 1.
For φ = 0 the initial values of resonant phases, ψ2(0)
and ψ3(0), are zero corresponding to the integrable limit
with λmax = 0 independently on the value of α (not

We consider now the situation corresponding to the
left hand side of Fig. 1 with α
1. This is the para-
metric ampliﬁcation with a low-frequency pump [12]. In
this case our analysis demonstrates that the evolution
of waves is weakly chaotic for
distant from the
integrable limit. In this regime, the Lyapunov exponent
has some very small but yet positive value, therefore it
is very diﬃcult to distinguish a weak chaos from a regu-
lar motion. In practical terms, it means that one needs

tween regular and weakly chaotic spatial evolutions of
light waves.

Now we turn to the consideration of nonlinear dynam-
ics using the second set of QPM parameters but same set

high order QPMs is more stable against a transition to
chaos in comparison with the case of ﬁrst order QPMs.
We consider now a nonlinear dynamics in the case
when some portion of energy is presented at z = 0 in
each of interacting waves (“Problem 2”). We present our
ﬁndings in Fig. 4. A strong chaos arises as soon as one

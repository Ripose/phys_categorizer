Abstract

The Bruggeman formalism for the homogenization of particulate composite materials is used
to predict the eﬀective permittivity dyadic of a two–constituent composite material with one
constituent having the ability to display the Pockels eﬀect. Scenarios wherein the constituent
particles are randomly oriented, oriented spheres, and oriented spheroids are numerically ex-
plored. Thereby, homogenized composite materials (HCMs) are envisaged whose constitutive
parameters may be continuously varied through the application of a low–frequency (dc) electric
ﬁeld. The greatest degree of control over the HCM constitutive parameters is achievable when
the constituents comprise oriented and highly aspherical particles and have high electro–optic
coeﬃcients.

Keywords: Bruggeman formalism, composite material, electro–optics, homogenization, partic-
ulate material, Pockels eﬀect

Introduction

In 1806, after having ascended the skies in a balloon to collect samples of air at diﬀerent heights
and after having ascertained the proportions of diﬀerent gases in each sample, Jean–Baptiste
Biot and Fran¸cois Arago published the ﬁrst known homogenization formula for the refractive
index of a mixture of mutually inert gases as the weighted sum of their individual refractive
indexes, the weights being in ratios of their volumetric proportions in the mixture (Biot & Arago
1806). The Arago–Biot mixture formula heralded the science and technology of particulate
composite materials — particularly in optics, more generally in electromagnetics, and even
more generally in many other branches of physics. An intensive literature has developed over
the last two centuries in optics (Neelakanta 1995; Lakhtakia 1996), and recent forays into the

1

realms of metamaterials and complex mediums (Grimmeiss et al. 2002; Weiglhofer & Lakhtakia
2003; Mackay 2005) have reaﬃrmed the continued attraction of both particulate composite
materials and homogenization formalisms.

Post–fabrication dynamic control of the eﬀective properties of a mixture of two constituent
materials is a technologically important capability underlying the successful deployment of a host
of smart materials and structures. Dynamic control can be achieved in many ways, particularly
if controlability and sensing capablity are viewed as complementary attributes. One way is to
inﬁltrate the composite material with another substance, possibly a ﬂuid, to change, say, the
eﬀective optical response properties (Lakhtakia et al. 2001; M¨onch et al. 2006). This can be
adequate if rapidity of change is not a critical requirement. Another way is to tune the eﬀective
properties by the application of pressure (Finkelmann et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2003) or change
of temperature (Schadt & F¨unfschilling 1990). Faster ways of dynamic control could involve the
use of electric ﬁelds if one constituent material is a liquid crystal (Yu et al. 2005) or magnetic
ﬁelds if one constituent material is magnetic (Shafarman et al. 1986).

Our focus in this paper is the control of the eﬀective permittivity tensor of a two–constituent
composite material, wherein both constituent materials are classiﬁed as dielectric materials
in the optical regime but one can display the Pockels eﬀect (Boyd 1992). Both constituent
materials can be distributed as ellipsoidal particles whose orientations can be either ﬁxed or be
completely random.

The plan of this paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a description of the particulate compos-
ite material of interest, as well as the key equations of the Bruggeman homogenization formalism
(Bruggeman 1935; Weiglhofer et al. 1997) adopted to estimate the relative permittivity dyadic
of the homogenized composite material (HCM). Section 3 presents a few numerical examples to
show that the Pockels eﬀect can be exploited to dynamically control the linear optical response
properties of composite materials through a low–frequency electric ﬁeld. Given the vast param-
eter space underlying the Pockels eﬀect, we emphasize that the examples presented are merely
illustrative. Some brief concluding remarks are provided in Section 4.

A note about notation: Vectors are in boldface, dyadics are double underlined. A Cartesian
coordinate system with unit vectors ux,y,z is adopted. The identity dyadic is written as I, and
the null dyadic as 0. An exp(

2 Theory

Let the two constituent materials of the particulate composite material be labeled a and b. Their
respective volumetric proportions are denoted by fa and fb = 1
fa. They are distributed as
ellipsoidal particles. The dyadic

similarly describes the shape of the particles made of material b. A low–frequency (or dc) electric
ﬁeld Edc acts on the composite material, the prediction of whose eﬀective permittivity dyadic
in the optical regime is of interest.

Material a does not display the Pockels eﬀect and, for simplicity, we take it to be isotropic

with relative permittivity scalar ǫ(a) in the optical regime.

Material b has more complicated dielectric properties as it displays the Pockels eﬀect. Its
linear electro–optic properties are expressed through the inverse of its relative permittivity
dyadic in the optical regime, which is written as (Boyd 1992)

Let the Bruggeman estimate of the relative permittivity dyadic of HCM be denoted by ǫBr.
If the particles of material a are all identically oriented with respect to their crystallographic

Even more complicated orientational averages — e.g., of particulate shapes and geometric ori-
entation of particles, in addition to crystallographic orientation — can be similarly handled.

The HCM relative permittivity ǫBr can be extracted from equation (8) and equation (15)
iteratively using standard techniques, and a Jacobi iteration technique is recommended (Michel
2000).

3 Numerical results and discussion

A vast parameter space is covered by the homogenization formalism described in the previous
section. The parameters include: the volumetric proportions and the shape dyadics of materials
a and b; the relative permittivity scalar ǫ(a); the three relative permittivity scalars ǫ(b)
K and the
upto 18 distinct electro–optic coeﬃcients rJK of material b; the angles θb and φb that describe
the crystallographic orientation of material b with respect to the laboratory coordinate system;
and the magnitude and direction of Edc. To provide illustrative results here, we set ǫ(a) = 1.
All calculations were made for two choices of material b (Cook 1996):

I. zinc telluride, which belongs to the cubic ¯43m crystallographic class: ǫ(b)

1 = ǫ(b)

Given the huge parameter space still left, we chose to ﬁx fb = 0.5, the Bruggeman formalism
then being maximally distinguished from other homogenization formalisms such as the Maxwell
Garnett (Weiglhofer et al. 1997) and the Bragg–Pippard formalisms (Bragg & Pippard 1953;
Sherwin & Lakhtakia 2002). Finally, we chose particles of material a and b to be spherical (i.e.,
U (a) = U (b) = I) in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, and spheroidal in Section 3.3.

Two diﬀerent scenarios based on the orientation of material b were investigated. The scenario
wherein the material b particles are randomly oriented with respect to their crystallographic axes
was considered in the study presented in Section 3.1. Particles of material b were taken to have
the same orientation with respect to their crystallographic axes in the studies presented in
Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

For all scenarios, the estimated permittivity dyadic of the HCM may be compactly represented

as

ǫBr = αBr I + βBr (uM uN + uN uM ),

(16)

wherein the unit vectors uM and uN are aligned with the optic ray axes of the HCM (Chen
1983; Weiglhofer & Lakhtakia 1999; Mackay & Weiglhofer 2001). For the real–symmetric rela-
tive permittivity dyadic ǫBr, with three distinct (and orthonormalised) eigenvectors e1,2,3 and

3.1 Randomly oriented spherical electro–optic particles

We begin by considering the scenario wherein the particles of material b are randomly oriented
with respect to their crystallographic axes, and the particles of both materials are spherical. Ac-
cordingly, the HCM is an isotropic dielectric medium, characterized by the relative permittivity
dyadic ǫBr = ǫBrI.

The Bruggeman estimate ǫBr, as extracted from equation (15), is plotted in Figure 1 against
3 , with Edc
Edc
1,2 = 0. Material b is zinc telluride for the upper graph and potassium niobate for
the lower in this ﬁgure. The range for the magnitude of Edc in Figure 1 — and for all subsequent
ﬁgures — was chosen in order to comply with (7). In the case where material b is zinc telluride,

changes, and ǫBr is insensitive to the sign of ǫBr. A greater
ǫBr varies only slightly as Edc
3
degree of sensitivity to Edc
3 is observed for the HCM which arises when material b is potassium
niobate; in this case the HCM’s relative permittivity is also sensitive to the sign of Edc
3 , thereby
underscoring the signiﬁcance of crystallographic class of the electro–optic constituent material
even when averaging over crystallographic orientation is physically valid.

3.2 Identically oriented spherical electro–optic particles

The scenario wherein all particles of material b are taken to be identically oriented, with particles
of both constituent materials being spherical, is now considered. Let us begin with the case
where material b is zinc telluride. This is an isotropic material when Edc = 0, but the anisotropy
underlying the Pockels eﬀect becomes evident on the application of the low–frequency electric
ﬁeld (Lakhtakia 2006b).

1,2 with Edc

The HCM parameters, as extracted from equation (8), are plotted in Figure 2 as functions
of Edc
3 = 0. The crystallographic orientation angles θb = φb = 0. As expected, in this
ﬁgure δn = δbi = 0 (i.e., the HCM is isotropic) when Edc
2 = 0. The HCM constitutive
parameters ǫBr
2 . The HCM
is negatively biaxial in general (because δbi < 0), although the biaxiality is small. The linear
birefringence is not sensitive to the signs of Edc
is increased,
as a glance at data on minerals readily conﬁrms (Griblle & Hall 1992). The two optic ray axes
remain almost mutually orthogonal, as indicated by δ

2 , δn, δbi, δ, and θM,N are all insensitive to the signs of Edc

1,2; it increases considerably as

1 and Edc

are changed.

The inﬂuence of the orientation angle θb for zinc telluride is explored in Figure 3. Here, the
45◦, 90◦
optic ray axis angles θM,N are plotted as functions of Edc
}
with φb = 0. The orientations of both optic ray axes continuously vary with increasing Edc
1,2
in a manner which continuously varies as θb increases. The polar angle of the optic ray axis

aligned with uM , namely θM , is slightly sensitive to Edc

Figure 3 — are insensitive to increasing θb; the plots for these quantities are not noticeably
diﬀerent from the corresponding plots presented in Figure 2.

1,2 with Edc

1 and Edc

Let us turn now to the case where material b is potassium niobate. This material is anisotropic
(orthorhombic and negatively biaxial) even when the Pockels eﬀect is not invoked, and it has
much higher electro–optic coeﬃcients than zinc telluride — hence, it can be expected to lead a
diﬀerent palette of HCM properties.

The HCM parameters are plotted in Figure 4 as functions of Edc

2 , δn, δbi, and δ are not particularly sensitive to Edc

1 = 0. As in Figure 2,
the crystallographic orientation angles of material b are taken as θb = φb = 0. Whereas the
parameters ǫBr
2 , they do vary signiﬁcantly as
Edc
3 varies. Most notably, the HCM can be made either negatively biaxial (δbi < 0) or positively
biaxial (δbi > 0). The two optic axes of the HCM need not be mutually orthogonal, with the
included angle 2δ between them as low as 40◦. The polar angles θM,N are sensitive to both Edc
2
and Edc
3 does not inﬂuence any of the HCM parameters, but the
sign of Edc

3 . We note that the sign of Edc

2 does inﬂuence the polar angles θM,N .

2,3 with Edc

The inﬂuence of the orientation angle θb is explored in Figure 5. The constitutive parameters

7

of material b are the same as in Figure 4 but with θb ∈ {
. As is the case in Figure 3, the
}
graphs in Figure 5 show that the dependencies of the polar angles θM,N upon the components
of Edc are acutely sensitive to θb. The HCM parameters ǫBr
2 , δn, δbi, and δ — which are not
presented in Figure 5 — are insensitive to increasing θb; the plots for these quantities are not
noticeably diﬀerent to the corresponding plots presented in Figure 4.

45◦, 90◦

A comparison of Figures 2 and 3 with Figures 4 and 5 shows that the application of Edc is
more eﬀective when material b is potassium niobate rather than zinc telluride. A dc electric
ﬁeld that is two orders smaller in magnitude is required for changing the HCM properties with
potassium niobate than with zinc telluride, and this observation is reaﬃrmed by comparing the
upper and lower graphs in Figure 1. To a great extent, this is due to the larger electro–optic
coeﬃcients of potassium niobate; however, we cannot rule out some eﬀect of the crystallographic
structure of material b, which we plan to explore in the near future.

Electrical control appears to require dc electric ﬁelds of high magnitude. However, the needed
dc voltages can be comparable with the half–wave voltages of electro–optic materials (Yariv &
Yeh 2007). We must also note that the required magnitudes of Edc are much smaller than the
characteristic atomic electric ﬁeld strength (Boyd 1992). The possibility of electric breakdown
exists, but it would signiﬁcantly depend on the time that the dc voltage would be switched
on for. Finally, the non–electro–optic constituent material may have to be a polymer that can
withstand high dc electric ﬁelds.

3.3 Identically oriented spheroidal electro–optic particles

We close by considering the scenario wherein the eﬀect of the Pockels eﬀect is going to be highly
noticeable in the HCM — that is, when the particles of material b are highly aspherical and the
crystallographic orientation as well as the geometric orientation of these particles are aligned
with Edc. We chose potassium niobate — which is more sensitive to the application of Edc than
zinc telluride — for our illustrative results.

In Figure 6, the HCM parameters ǫBr

1,2 =
0. Both constituent materials are distributed as identical spheroids with shape parameters
α1,2 = β1,2 = 1 and α3 = β3 ∈ {

this scenario, θN is not plotted. All the presented HCM parameters vary considerably as Edc

increases; furthermore, all are sensitive to the sign of Edc

2 , δn, δbi, δ, and θM are plotted against Edc

3 , with Edc

−

We note that the degree of biaxiality and the linear birefringence increase as α3 = β3 increases.
This is a signiﬁcant conclusion because perovskites (such as potassium niobate) are nowadays
being deposited as oriented nanopillars (Gruverman & Kholkin 2006).

4 Concluding remarks

The homogenization of particulate composite materials with constituent materials that can
exhibit the Pockels eﬀect gives rise to HCMs whose eﬀective constitutive parameters may be
continuously varied through the application of a low–frequency (dc) electric ﬁeld. Observable
eﬀects can be achieved even when the constituent particles are randomly oriented. Greater

8

control over the HCM constitutive parameters may be achieved by orienting the constituent
particles. By homogenizing constituent materials which comprise oriented elongated particles
rather than oriented spherical particles, the degree of electrical control over the HCM consti-
tutive parameters is further increased. The vast panoply of complex materials currently being
investigated (Grimmeiss et al. 2002; Weiglhofer & Lakhtakia 2003; Mackay 2005; Mackay &

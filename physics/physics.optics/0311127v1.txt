Eigenvector Expansion and Petermann Factor for Ohmically Damped Oscillators

Alec Maassen van den Brink, K. Young, and M. H. Yung

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Thermal correlation functions C(t) ∼ hφ(t)φ(0)i in ohmically damped systems such as optical
resonators can be expressed as a sum over modes j. In contrast to the conservative case, each term
is multiplied by the Petermann factor Cj, which can exceed unity and lead to “excess noise”. A
time-independent perturbation ∼ǫ also leads to a response ∼ǫCj. Moreover, C −1
is proportional to
a diagonal bilinear map central to eigenvector expansions for damped systems. “Giant excess noise”
(Cj → ∞) occurs in the limit of a critical point, where the divergent parts of J (>1) contributions
to C(t) cancel and time-independent perturbations lead to non-analytic shifts ∼ǫ1/J . A sum rule
implies that (for the normal case of positive masses) the average value of |Cj | over all modes is ≥ 1,
showing that “excess noise” is not exceptional.

INTRODUCTION

In open optical cavities, spontaneous emission rates
and thermal noise in a mode j are modiﬁed by a factor
Cj, which can paradoxically exceed unity and give rise
to “excess noise”. This possibility was ﬁrst pointed out
by Petermann [1] for gain-guided semiconductor lasers,
and Cj has come to be known as the Petermann factor
(PF). This prediction was initially controversial [2], until
Haus and Kawakami [3] pointed out the importance of
correlation with other modes. Siegman [4] showed that
excess noise is present in all open-sided laser resonators or
optical lens guides. New [5] drew attention to examples
where the PF can be very large. Berry [6] has given
a more general account, and in particular stressed the
importance of degeneracies. The subject continues to be
debated in the optics community [7].

This paper generalizes these concepts in two ways: the
range of systems to which the PF applies, and for each
system the range of processes for which it is relevant.

Firstly, we show that the issues are not peculiar to op-
tical cavities, but are relevant for any ohmically damped
linear system (see Section VII for further generaliza-
tions).
In linear conservative systems, thermal corre-
can be written as a
lation functions C(t)
sum over eigenvectors or normal modes j — expansion
in other bases would result in double sums over mode
indices.
In ohmically damped systems, this statement
again holds, where now the eigenvectors are quasinormal
modes with complex eigenvalues ωj. We show, within
this general context, that each term in this expansion is
multiplied by the PF Cj, and that this factor can ex-
ceed unity. The broader context exhibits the essential
concepts with clarity, bypassing the complexities of par-
ticular modes in optical resonators, and allows simple
ﬁnite-dimensional examples to be studied.

Secondly, for any given system, the PF occurs in many
processes and quantities, e.g., in the response to time-
independent perturbations. The ubiquity of this factor
stems from the mathematical structure of eigenvector ex-
pansions for damped systems, where orthogonality is de-

ﬁned not with respect to the familiar inner product, but
with respect to a symmetric bilinear map; equivalently
there is a nontrivial duality map. The PF is essentially
the ratio between these two mathematical constructs —
the inner product which deﬁnes length, and the bilinear
map which deﬁnes orthogonality.

Section II develops the linear-space structure and ex-
pansion in eigenvectors fj for ohmically damped systems,
introducing the bilinear map (ψ, φ) under which eigen-

Section IV shows that the familiar Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger
perturbation theory applies to the complex eigenvalues,
provided eigenvectors are normalized by (fj, fj). Thus a
time-independent perturbation
ǫCj,
i.e., possibly “excess” response. Simple systems with ﬁ-
nite (indeed few) degrees of freedom are studied, and in
particular, examples of “giant excess noise” (Cj large,
and divergent as a parameter is tuned) are easily con-
structed.

This invites the question: What happens if Cj → ∞
or equivalently (fj , fj)
0? Section V shows that this
happens if and only if J > 1 eigenvectors merge at a
critical point, where the divergent parts of the J terms
cancel, leaving a ﬁnite result. Section VI shows that at
a critical point, the divergent PF is manifested as large

By placing the formalism in a general context, we
make contact with two well-known results. First, critical
damping (in the elementary sense of that word) of one
single oscillator precisely provides an example of “giant
excess noise” — thus helping to demystify the PF. Sec-
ond, the factor (fj, fj) and thus also the PF, is shown to
be related to the Zeldovich normalizing factor for quasi-
normal modes [8].

This paper emphasizes the role played by the PF. A

ties will be given elsewhere [9].

Damping introduces an arrow of time and it is conve-

The diagonal bilinear map

The formalism so far relies on two assumptions: (a)
the eigenvectors are complete, and (b) (fj, fj)
= 0
for all j. These two conditions are related. To see
that (a) implies (b), suppose that at a critical point an

eigenvector is lost because of merging, say fk →
Then, (fj , fj) = lim (fj, fk) = 0. Conversely, suppose
(fj, fj) = 0. Then if the eigenvectors are complete, fj

ψ = D−1fj, one ﬁnds

If all eigenvalues are distinct, there will be 2N eigen-
vectors, which must be linearly independent. Thus, the
eigenvectors can only be incomplete if χ(ω) has a root of
order J > 1. When J roots merge (degeneracy) as a pa-
rameter is tuned, there are two possibilities: either there
are still J linearly independent eigenvectors, the usual
and familiar case of level crossing, or the eigenvectors
merge as well, which will be called criticality for rea-
sons that will become apparent. (The non-generic case
where some but not all of the J eigenvectors merge will
be ignored except for an example in Appendix A.) In-
completeness occurs only at criticality.

We shall later show that criticality is more generic than
level crossing — somewhat surprising since for conser-
vative systems, criticality is not allowed whereas level

In these examples of critical damping (in the elemen-
tary sense of that word), a pair of conjugate eigenvalues
ωj and ω−j =
j merge on the imaginary axis. This
occurs with codimension = 1 in parameter space, and is
the most generic class of the merging of eigenvectors —
which we therefore refer to as criticality in general. Less
generic cases, occurring with codimension > 1 in param-
eter space, include (a) the merging of two eigenvalues oﬀ
the imaginary axis, and (b) the merging of J > 2 eigen-
values. Some examples are given in Appendix A.

The square bracket in (3.11) and (3.12) is normalized
in the sense that its trace with M (α, β) is bounded by
unity; if a mode has negligible dissipation (ωj real) or is
overdamped (ωj imaginary), the eigenvector has a con-
stant phase, and the trace has unit modulus. Thus Cj
appropriately expresses the relative contribution of each
mode. The familiar conservative case is recovered by set-
ting all Cj = 1. Herein lies the paradox: the response
per mode to thermal noise can be increased by dissipation
(“excess noise”); near criticality, some Cj’s even diverge
(“giant excess noise”). We have also shown in the last

perturbation. The intercept (slope) veriﬁes ﬁrst-order
(second-order) perturbation. The remaining discrepancy
is consistent with an ǫ3 term in ∆ω. Interestingly, the
same formula now correctly gives the imaginary part of
the shift as well.

Cj diverges. In Section III C it was already demonstrated
through an example that the divergent parts cancel; this
Section shows this in general. Indeed, a similar cancella-
tion occurs in all physical quantities involving Cj .

Finally we note that writing perturbation theory in
terms of (fj, fj) [cf. (4.2)] exhibits the formal analogy
with conservative systems, whereas writing it in terms of
Nj and Cj [cf. (4.4)] emphasizes the possibility of anoma-
lously large shifts.

This paper has its root in an early work by Zel-
dovich [8], who used an integral expression [the analog
of (fj , fj)] to normalize the matrix element in perturba-
tion theory for a continuous system suﬀering dissipation
due to outgoing waves, giving a result equivalent to (4.2).
The normalizing factor, originally involving a regulator,
was later given in a more convenient form and applied
widely [17]. The generalization to oﬀ-diagonal bilinear
maps through a ﬁrst-order formalism [18, 19] in fact mo-
tivates our (2.6).

However, one can normalize the eigenvectors fj before

Consider (3.11), use (5.6) for (fj, fj), put ωj = ω∗ +
λζj , and expand in powers of λ, giving terms proportional
0. But from (5.1), all the
to
≥
negative powers sum to zero. This resolves the small
denominator problem, namely the paradox that as λ
→
0, the contribution of each mode diverges (“giant excess
noise”). We do not spell out the remaining ﬁnite terms,
which are in any event more appropriately expressed in
terms of the Jordan normal basis

.

Although the divergent parts cancel in the sum for
C(α, β; t), one could choose linear combinations that sin-
gle out only one mode. What happens to the cancellation
in that case? For simplicity suppose two modes j = 1, 2
are close to criticality, and consider

gn}

{

(dt+iω1)φ(α, t) φ(β, 0)

.

(5.8)

The operator (dt+iω1) eliminates the j=1 contribution,
through the appearance of an extra factor
ω1)
in (3.11) and (3.12). However, the remaining j=2 term
will then carry a factor
ω1), which also vanishes
i(ω2−
at criticality. Thus projecting out one near-critical mode
also suppresses other such modes, so that again the phys-
ical result is not large. Contrast the conservative case,
where the projection operator annihilating one mode
does not at the same time suppress the others.

ζj = e2πij/J

(6.3)

Thus (a) the shifts go as ǫ1/J (non-analytic in ǫ and
ǫ);
(b) the eigenvalues split into J diﬀerent ones, shifting in
equiangular directions in the complex frequency plane,
all at the same rate; (c) the directions of splitting for
ǫ < 0 bisect those for ǫ > 0. These features are already
contained in the trivial N = 1 example: for k = k∗+ǫ, the
√ǫ, approaching the critical point
eigenvalues are
along the real (imaginary) direction for ǫ > 0 (ǫ < 0).

VII. CONCLUSION

In ohmically damped linear systems, including a broad
class of optical resonators, the correlation function can be
expressed as a sum over eigenvectors j, diﬀering from the

6
∼

∼

conservative case only through the appearance of the PF
Cj multiplying each term. In this paper we have demon-
strated this in a broad context, allowing many interesting
properties to be established in a systematic way, without
reference to the details of the modes in optical cavities.
For example, (complex) frequency shifts in response to
time-independent perturbations are also proportional to
at critical points,
Cj. We have also shown that Cj → ∞
but (a) in the correlation function the divergent parts
cancel, while (b) in time-independent perturbation the-
ory the shifts

ǫCj go over to

ǫ1/J .

ner product. In dissipative systems, lengths of eigenvec-
tors are given by Nj whereas projections are given by the
bilinear map (ψ, φ). The PF arises because these are dif-
ferent mathematical constructs. That is, the linear-space
structure for dissipative systems is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from that for conservative systems, and will be given in
more detail elsewhere [9]. The inner product and bilinear
map are related by the duality D, whose representation
(2.7) is crucial here. This requires a ﬁrst-order formalism,
involving both coordinates and momenta (in the optics
case, both the magnetic and electric ﬁelds), an ingredient
previously missing in the literature.

The present discussion for a ﬁnite number of linear
classical oscillators is readily generalized. (a) Many mod-
els of dispersion can be accommodated by enlarging the
linear space, or equivalently postulating hidden ohmic os-
cillators [20]. (b) Turning α into a continuous variable x
gives continuum models, in which nearest-neighbor cou-
plings (i.e., only between α and α
1) turn into a second-
order spatial derivative ∂2
x; see Appendix B. Electromag-
netic waves in optical resonators are then included. (c)

Eigenvector expansions

while equations of motion are modiﬁed only by the pres-
ence of quantum noise (which however needs to be han-
dled with care). The coeﬃcients aj and (aj )∗ then be-
come annihilation and creation operators. (d) Certain
two-point correlations are just the Feynman propagators,
which can be used to construct a perturbative expansion
for interacting (i.e., nonlinear) ﬁelds, much in the usual
way. Interestingly, ∆jk(t)
is not diago-

nal. In fact, the usual logical chain from plane electro-
magnetic waves to electromagnetic propagators to free
photons to interacting photons can be simply repeated
— with the diﬀerence that each mode in the expansion
is now a quasinormal mode, and each term carries the
PF Cj. These further developments, which will be given

elsewhere, open the way to a description of cavity quan-
tum electrodynamics in terms of the damped quasinor-
mal modes, convenient because of their discrete nature.

APPENDIX A: NON-GENERIC CRITICALITY

Section II showed examples of generic criticality with
codimension one in parameter space, in which a pair of
eigenvalues coalesce on the imaginary axis, correspond-
ing to the classic case of critical damping. This Appendix
describes some non-generic examples. It suﬃces to con-
sider a system of N = 2 oscillators with M = I, and K,
= 0, so there are 6
Γ given by (2.24), but allowing γ12 6
parameters.

1. Fourth-order block

≤

H−

To obtain a block where J = 4 eigenvalues merge, we
require χ(ω) to have a 4th-order zero on the imaginary
ω) = (ω+i)4 by a choice of scale. This
axis: det(
identity gives four equations, leading to a 2-parameter
family of solutions, of which a simple 1-parameter subset
is: k11 = k22 = cosh(x), k12 = sinh(x), γ11 = 1 + s3,
s3, γ12 = s2, where sn = sinhn(x/2)/ sinh(x).
γ22 = 1
Positivity of Γ requires cosh(x)

The eigenvector(s) are found from (K

Γ + I)f =
0, and generically there is only one solution, hence a
J = 4 block. However, exceptionally there can be more
than one eigenvector, leading to the crossing of diﬀerent
blocks. For a 2
Γ + I = 0,
and happens only for x = 0 — the trivial case of two
independent but identical oscillators, each generating a
J = 2 block at the critical point. Interestingly, one can-
not produce crossing between J = 3 and J = 1 blocks
with only two oscillators.

shifts go as ǫ1/2, and the shifts for opposite signs of ǫ
bisect each other — for J = 2, the shifts in orthogonal
directions resemble critical damping in the elementary
sense.

These non-generic examples are much easier to con-
struct and analyze than for continuum models (such as
optical cavities), and readily verify the properties of the
PF when J eigenvectors are close to each other. Further

FIG. 1: The real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of the ∆ω/ǫ, where ∆ω is the shift in the eigenvalue for the system described in
Section II, due to a perturbation k11 7→ k11 + ǫ. Straight lines are second-order perturbation theory; points are exact roots of
the characteristic polynomial.

FIG. 2: Position of eigenvalues in the complex plane when a J = 2 critical point in a discrete model (see Appendix A) is split
upon k11 7→ k11 + ǫ, with ǫ = n2ǫ0, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .; ǫ0 = 1 × 10−4 (plus signs) ǫ0 = −1 × 10−4 (crosses). The nearly equal
spacing shows that the shifts are ∝ ǫ1/2.

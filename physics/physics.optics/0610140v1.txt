We analyze the propagation of electromagnetic waves in media where the dielectric constants
undergo rapid temporal periodic modulation. Both spatially homogeneous and periodic media are
studied. Fast periodic temporal modulation of the dielectric constant of a homogeneous medium
leads to existence of photonic band-gap like phenomena. In the presence of both spatial and tem-
poral periodicity the electromagnetic spectrum is described in a four-dimensional cube, deﬁning an
eﬀective Brillouin zone. In the case of incommensurability between space and time periodicities,
completely dispersed point spectra exist.

The advent of materials whose electric permittivity ε is
periodically modulated at the nanometer length scale has
introduced the important concept of photonic band-gap
structures. This has in turn made traditional solid-state
concepts like reciprocal space, Brillioun zones, dispersion
relations, Bloch wave functions, etc. directly applicable
to the ﬁeld of classical electromagnetic wave propagation.
During the last decades the attractive possible applica-
tions of such photonic band gap materials have driven
intense theoretical and experimental studies of the prop-
agation of electromagnetic waves in spatially periodic and
disordered dielectric structures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This
has provided the ﬁeld of photonics with a wide range of
new applications, mostly related to guided light modes
[8]. Recently a magnetic photonic crystal was made [9]
by periodically modulating the magnetic permeabilityµ
of specially constructed material.

Although there have also been tentative studies of ef-
fects arising from low frequency [10], and speciﬁc cases
[11] of temporal modulation of the dielectric constant, this
possibility has been largely ignored. However, as we show
here, essentially all fruitful concepts from the now ma-
ture ﬁeld of photonic band-gap materials can be applied
in the case of fast temporal modulation of a material’s
dielectric response. Further, the combination of spatial
and temporal modulation of the dielectric response in-
troduces intriguing new concepts to the ﬁeld of classic
electromagnetic wave propagation. The results are also
valid for periodical modulation of the magnetic perme-
ability µ of spatially homogeneous or periodic magnetic
media.
First,

it is straightforward to realize that temporal
modulation leads to photonic band structures similar to
In a material with a time depen-
spatial modulation:

which is the central property for photonic band-gap the-
ory.

By casting the problem in this form, it is reduced to de-
termining the dispersion relation k = k(ω). As is the case
for traditional photonic crystals, the dispersion relation
will contain the frequency regime where electromagnetic
wave propagation is possible, as well as the ”photonic
gaps” where the propagation of electromagnetic waves is
damped (or ampliﬁed) [13]. A possible realization of tem-
poral dielectric modulation is to apply standing waves
with time dependent intensity, in the form of one, two or
three perpendicular laser beams, on a dielectric slab, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. This concept is widely applied to
create optical lattices within Bose-Einstein condensates
[14] . Applying the beams on a spatially homogeneous or
multi-dimensionally modulated dielectric slabs, a variety
of space-time dielectric structures can be generated.

First, we study the simple case of periodic dielectric
modulation of a linear and homogeneous medium by
modeling it(see Fig. 2) as a series of pulses character-
ized by the two times τ and 1
γ is
the duration of a single pulse of the dielectric function
of the material ε(t), and τ is the period of repetition
of the pulses. If the standing wave laser beam consists

Without further approximations we ﬁnd after some ma-

In Fig. 3 we illustrate this dispersion relation, Eq. 9.
The width of the gap is very small because of the realis-
tic [17] smallness of the modulation εtemp
ε0 = 0.01 of the
dielectric constant. One can easily see that the widths of
the gaps are proportional to εtemp. Figure 4 shows the
width of the band-gap as a function of τ and γ. This
width is much larger for high frequencies but is relatively
insensitive to γ. At this point it is instructive to note
that for a traditional one dimensional photonic crystal,

of ultrashort pulses, a single pulse duration ε(t) in the
15sec can be realized. Similarly, a
range γ = 10−
pulse separation cτ comparable to the wavelength of the
light in the medium is realistic. Speciﬁcally, we study
the propagating waves in a 1 + 1 space-time scalar wave
equation (1) by assuming the dielectric constant to be of

The speciﬁc choice (see Fig. 2 ) of the function g(t)
is motivated by its convenient form for analytical treat-
ment: For narrow pulse widths (γ
), g(t) reduces to
a δ-function and the model is then similar to the Kronig-
Penney model. Applying this expression in Eq. (3) for

We can now establish the dispersion relation between
the normalized frequency ω and the normalized wave-
number k. For simplicity we ﬁrst examine the case of
s = 1, where the temporal and spatial periodicities are
equal, Lt = Lx. We ﬁnd that the dispersion of such a
media is dominated by a vacuum -like dispersion rela-
tion i.e. ω
sk. The spectrum in this case is given
mostly by the diagonal of the unit square, resembling in
this sense a homogeneous medium. The actual disper-
sion depicted in Fig. 5 shows this overall behavior but,
as can be clearly seen in the inset, the underlying struc-
ture is very complex. In fact the dispersion relation is a
dense set of discrete points clustering around two sepa-
rate branches. From this case we can easily construct the
overall structure of the dispersion relation resulting from
rational values of s
= 1. For an integer values of s > 1
sk results in values of ω > 1 and so
the relation ω
this part of the dispersive branch is folded back into the
1 > 1
standard zone. Similarly, for integer values of s−
the roles of ω and k are reversed and the k values have

4x10−12 sec; γ = 4; ε0 = 11; εt = 0.01. The ”band-gap” is
displayed in the upper inset.

Turning now to the more general question of multidi-
mensional periodicity, we assume the dielectric constant
ε(r, t) to be a periodic function of both space and time,
and solve the Maxwell equations for the electric ﬁeld
~E(r, t). Again we have the Bloch type solutions with
respect to space and time variables and so we introduce
Bloch-Floquet parameters. The ﬁnal dispersion relation
will then relate k and ω. This means that in the case
of combined spatial and temporal periodicity the electro-
magnetic excitations spectrum is described by separated
points represented by (k, ω), all belonging to an equiva-
lent four-dimensional cube deﬁning the four-dimensional
Brillouin zone. For simplicity, we consider the dielec-
tric constant ε(r, t) to be of the type ε(r, t) = ε(r)ε(t),
i.e. we assume independent spatial and temporal mod-
ulations of the dielectric media. The general solution of
the wave equation is then

to be folded back into the standard zone. Therefore, for
rational values of s = M/N , where M and N are in-
tegers leads to the repetition of M branches along the
k axis and N branches along the ω axis. This is illus-
trated in Fig. 6, where the s = 2/3 case is displayed.
When s is not a rational number, every single line de-
termining the dispersion relations has a deﬁnite width.
This means that in these cases any ω corresponds to an
inﬁnite number of k values, and vice-versa. This is com-
pletely new situation, which has no analog in photonic or
electronic band structures. The reason for this broaden-
ing is the existence of small but ﬁnite band-gaps. The
folding of the dispersion curves leads to a slight displace-
ment of the equivalent curves. The largest displacements
appear for the intervals of ν where gaps are large. Then,
at the larger values of ν, the curves become closer and
when ν tends to inﬁnity they approach the correspond-
ing straight line branches. This means that, when s is
not a rational number, incommensurability between the
spatial and temporal periodicities exists. In this case the
dispersion relation consists of separated points and it is
intriguingly complex, as is illustrated for s = √2 in the
inset of Fig. 6. Finally, we emphasize that all these ef-
fects exist when the time variation of ε(t) is rapid. When
ε(t) is a slowly varying function of time compared to the
amplitude Uk(t), we can simply ignore its time depen-
dence [20].

In summary, we have studied the eﬀects of time vari-
ation of the dielectric constant of diﬀerent electromag-
netic media, which leads to the existence of band-gap
like phenomena. The physical reason for these eﬀects
is the necessity of synchronization of the phases of the

propagating waves with the external time periodicity of
the medium.
In cases of simultaneous space and time
periodicity, we found an electromagnetic wave spectrum
essentially described in an equivalent two-dimensional,
three-dimensional or even four-dimensional cube deﬁning
the Brillouin zone. The folding of the dispersion relation
when s = M/N , with M and N integer, and broaden-
ing of dispersion curves have been demonstrated. When
= M/N the eﬀects of incommensurability of the two
s
internal lengths ( space Lx and time Lt = cτ
)exist,
√εo
and point like spectra are exhibited. Modulation of the
photonic band structure is suggested.

[18] An experimental test of these ideas could be made at
microwave frequencies. The response of most nonlinear
dielectric materials is much stronger at microwave fre-
quencies than at optical frequencies. For example,
in
Sr1−xBaxT iO3 compounds, it is possible to achieve εt =
0.2ε0 with ε0 = 300 for an applied electric ﬁeld of about
106V /m at frequencies up to several tens of GHz. In ad-
dition, at microwave frequencies, network analysis equip-
ment and techniques could be employed to achieve high
spectral resolution, good signal sensitivity, and large dy-
namic range.

[20] In this case one can, as a ﬁrst approximation, substitute
ε = ε(t) directly in the condition for the eﬀective ”Bragg

a photonic crystal with ﬁlling fraction f = 1/(2

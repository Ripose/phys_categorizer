Abstract

In recent years the topic of localized wave solutions of the homogeneous scalar wave equation,

i.e., the wave ﬁelds that propagate without any appreciable spread or drop in intensity, has been

discussed in many aspects in numerous publications. In this review the main results of this rather

disperse theoretical material are presented in a single mathematical representation – the Fourier

decomposition by means of angular spectrum of plane waves. This uniﬁed description is shown to

lead to a transparent physical understanding of the phenomenon as such and yield the means of

optical generation of such wave ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

The birth of the diﬀraction theory of light dates back to the works of Francis Maria

Grimaldi (1618 – 1663), Robert Hook (1635 – 1703), Christiaan Huygens (1629 – 1695) and

Thomas Young (1773 – 1829) and was mathematically formulated by Augustin Jean Fresnel

(1788 – 1827). Over the two centuries it has been considered as a very successful theory –

it indeed very precisely describes the propagation of light in linear media. The foundation

of the diﬀraction theory is the principle of Huygens which states that (i) all the points of

a wavefront act as the sources of secondary wavelets and (ii) the ﬁeld at all the subsequent

points is determined by the superposition of those wavelets.

The topic of free-space propagation of wave ﬁelds has attracted a renewed interest in 1983

when James Neill Brittingham claimed [1] that he discovered a family of three-dimensional,

nondispersive, source-free, free-space, classical electromagnetic pulses which propagate in a

straight line in free space at light velocity (in this work he also introduced the term focus

wave mode (FWM) for those wave ﬁelds). Now, the very idea of secondary spherical sources

in the classical diﬀraction theory implies that any optical wave ﬁeld suﬀers from lateral

and longitudinal spread in the course of propagation in free space, whereby the diﬀraction

angle of the spread is the larger the narrower is the ﬁeld radius. In the view of this general

principle the Brittingham’s statement is an astounding one and he quite rightly used the

formula ”to convince the scientiﬁc community” in its arguments. However, the original

focus wave mode was indeed the solutions of the Maxwell’s equations and the scientiﬁc

community had to resolve this apparent contradiction. As to give the reader an idea of the

initial problem the theoreticians had to tackle with, we reproduce here the original deﬁnition

of Brittingham which he deduced by ”a very extensive heuristical ﬁt of various diﬀerential

equation solutions”: given the Maxwell equations (SI)

formulation.

One has to agree, that the physical idea is very much hidden behind this mathematical

Brittingham claimed, that this mathematical formulation (i) satisfy the homogeneous

Maxwell’s equations, (ii) is continuous and nonsingular, (iii) has a three-dimensional pulse

structure, (iv) is nondispersive for all time, (v) move at light velocity in straight lines, and

(vi) carry ﬁnite electromagnetic energy. Thus, the formulas above give a mathematical

formulation of a free-space wave ﬁeld that can be described as a ”light bullet” and, though

7

the proof of the last claim was shown to be faulty by Wu and King [2], the whole idea was

very intricate and rose a considerable scientiﬁc interest [3]–[149].

The theoretical work of following years could be divided into the following topics (see

also Ref. [35] for an overview):

In the following publications [3, 6] the original vector ﬁeld was reduced to its scalar

counterpart and the dominant part of the research work that followed has been formulated

in terms of solutions to homogeneous scalar wave equation.

The close connection between the FWM’s and the solutions of the paraxial wave equation

and Schr¨odinger’s equation (which both allow localized solutions) has been established [3,

5, 6] – it has been shown that in terms of the variables z + ct and z

ct, if the solution of

the scalar wave equation is given by the anzatz exp [β (z + ct)] F (x, y, z

ct), the problem

−

−

can be reduced to one of those equations.

The inﬁnite energy content of the original FWM’s has been addressed in several pub-

lications (see Refs. [3, 4, 6, 14, 16, 31, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47] and references therein). First

of all, Sezginer [3] and Wu and Lehmann [4] proved that any ﬁnite energy solution of the

wave equation irreversibly leads to dispersion and to spread of the energy. Then Ziolkowski

[6] pointed out, that the superpositions of the inﬁnite energy FWM’s could result in ﬁ-

nite energy solutions and in following publications a number of ﬁnite energy solutions to

the scalar wave equation and Maxwell equations were deduced – ”electromagnetic directed-

energy pulse trains” (EDEPT) [31, 42], ”acoustic directed-energy pulse trains” (ADEPT)

[41] , splash pulses [6], modiﬁed power spectrum (MPS) [31] pulses, electromagnetic missiles

[26, 27], various super- and subluminal pulses [15] etc. In correspondence with [3, 4] this

broader class of localized waves (LW) have generally extended but ﬁnite ranges of localiza-

tions. Also, several alternate inﬁnite energy LW’s (Bessel-Gauss pulses [33] for example)

were deduced.

In Ref. [14] Besieris et al

introduced a novel integral representation for synthesizing

those LW’s. This bidirectional plane wave decomposition is based on a decomposition of

the solutions of the scalar wave equations into the forward and backward traveling plane

wave solutions and it has been shown to be a very natural basis for description of LW’s (see

Ref. [31] for example).

The FWM’s have been interpreted as being related in a special way to the ﬁeld of a source,

moving on a complex trajectory parallel to the real axis of propagation [6, 10, 12, 31]. This

8

observation linked the FWM’s with the works by Deschamps [150] and Felsen [151] where

the Gaussian beams have been described as being paraxially equivalent to spherical waves

with centers at stationary complex locations.

There has been a considerable eﬀort in ﬁnding the LW solutions in other branches of

physics, spanning various diﬀerential equations like spinor wave equation [22], ﬁst-order

hyperbolic systems like cold-plasma equation [23], Klein-Gordon equation [14, 15].

In 1988 Durnin [57] published his paper on so called Bessel beams (see for example

Ref. [98] for an earlier publication on the topic). The idea attracted much interest and

the Bessel beams and their pulsed counterparts – X-waves [104]–[112] and Bessel-X waves

[121, 122, 123] – became the research ﬁeld of its own rights. In this context the issue of

the superluminal propagation of a class of LW’s has been considered in Refs. [109, 114, 115,

116, 117, 118, 119].

It has been shown that the FWM’s can be described as monochromatic Gaussian beams

observed in a moving relativistic inertial reference frame [7, 35].

Propagation of optical pulses or beams without any appreciable drop in the intensity and

spread over long distances would be highly desirable in many applications. The obvious

uses could be in ﬁelds like optical communication, monitoring, imaging, and femtosecond

laser spectroscopy, also in laser acceleration of charged particles. Due to this general interest

the experimental generation FWM’s and LW’s has been discussed in numerous publications

(see Refs. [39]–[51] and references therein). However, the progress in this topic has been

moderate as there has been very few experimental results on LW’s.

A good understanding of the experimental diﬃculties can be given if we account for some

methods that have been proposed in literature:

The most widely discussed approach has been to use directly the principle of Huygens

and launch the LW’s from planar sources [43]. However, it appears that each point source

in such array must (i) have ultra-wide bandwidth and (ii) be independently drivable as the

temporal evolution of the LW’s generally is of the non-separable nature. Due to the present

state of the experiment this approach has not been realized even in radio-frequency domain

(it has been realized in acoustics [40, 41]).

In an another approach it has been shown that the LW’s can be launched by the so-called

Gaussian dynamic apertures, that are characterized by an eﬀective radius that shrinks from

an inﬁnite extensions at t

to a ﬁnite value at t

0, then expands once more to

→ −∞

→

9

an inﬁnite dimension as t

[45] or by the spectrally depleted (ﬁnite excitation time)

Gaussian apertures [46, 47, 48, 49].

→ ∞

It has been shown, that the ﬁeld from an inﬁnite line source contains a FWM component

[17] and the LW’s can be generated by a disk source moving ”more slowly than the speed

of light” [50, 51].

It can be easily understood that none of those approaches is feasible in optical domain.

In this review we make an eﬀort to give all the essential results published in literature

an uniﬁed description in the way that we use exlusively the Fourier decomposition methods,

unify the notation and transform the mathematical representation where necessary. Also,

we give to variety of known localized waves a transparent interpretation in terms of optical

feasibility. The review is organized as follows:

In the preliminary Chapter II we introduce the necessary integral representations for the

solutions of the Maxwell’s equations and scalar homogeneous wave equation. Predominantly

we will use the Fourier representation of the free-space wave ﬁelds.

In Chapter III we deduce what in our opinion is the physically most comprehensive

representation of the FWM’s and LW’s – we will show, that the necessary and suﬃcient

condition for a free-space wave ﬁeld to be propagation-invariant is that its support of angular

spectrum of plane waves is of a speciﬁc form. Several additional conclusions on the properties

of the LW’s will be drawn.

In Chapter IV we give an outline of the properties of the known (published) LW’s. The

material in this section is important, because, to our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time

where the optical feasibility of certain well-known closed-form LW’s is estimated – we will

see that majority of the known LW’s, including the original FWM’s, are not realizable in

optical domain.

In Chapter V we generalize the theory of the propagation-invariant propagation into the

domain of partially coherent wave ﬁelds – we deﬁne the conditions for the propagation-

invariance of the mutual coherence function of the wideband, stochastic, stationary ﬁelds.

The theory also gives a means of estimating the eﬀect of spatial and temporal coherence of

the source light on the properties of generated ﬁelds and is used in the analysis of the results

of our experiments.

In Chapter VI we present the general idea of the optical generation of LW’s. First

of all, the setup for the generation of simplest special case – optical Bessel-X pulses – is

10

introduced. Then we show that in Fourier picture the optical generation of FWM’s can

be resolved to applying speciﬁc angular dispersion to the Bessel-X pulses and discuss on

the ﬁnite energy approximations of the FWM’s. Also, the optical generation of partially

coherent propagation-invariant wave ﬁelds is discussed.

In Chapter VII we present the results of the experiments on optical LW’s carried on so

far. In particular, we report on experimental measurements of the whole three-dimensional

distribution of the ﬁeld of optical X waves – Bessel-X pulses – and provide the experimental

veriﬁcation of the optical feasibility of FWM’s.

In Chapter VIII we give an outline of our work on self-imaging pulsed wave ﬁelds – it

appears, that certain discrete superpositions of the FWM’s can be used to compose spa-

tiotemporally self-imaging wave ﬁelds that carry non-trivial three-dimensional images.

INTEGRAL REPRESENTATIONS OF FREE-SPACE ELECTROMAGNETIC

WAVE FIELDS

In this preliminary chapter we introduce the necessary integral representations for the

solutions of the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations and scalar homogeneous wave equation.

Only the free-space wave ﬁelds are considered, i.e., the wave ﬁelds under investigation do

not have any sources (except perhaps at inﬁnity) and they do not interact with any material

objects. As we will see, such an approach is suitable for our purposes.

homogeneous wave equation

If we substitute the Eqs. (4) – (5c) in (3a) and (3b) we have a general solution of free-space

Maxwell equations as a superposition of monochromatic plane waves.

The other approach is to determine the vector potential A as the solution of the homo-

geneous wave equation – if we use the Coulomb gauge and no sources are present the scalar

potential is zero and the ﬁelds are given by [164]

The choice of the vector components of the Hertz vectors and vector potential generally

which is the Weyl type superposition over the plane waves (see for example Ref. [163] for a

The Weyl type spectrum of plane waves is often derived as the Fourier transform of the

wave ﬁeld in plane z = 0. In contrary, the Whittaker type superposition is calculated as

its three-dimensional Fourier transform over the space. Note however, that the distinction

between the two is not clear for wideband wave ﬁelds, as the calculation of Weyl represen-

tation requires the knowledge of the evolution of the wave ﬁeld on the z = 0 plane for all

times [see Eq. (9)].

C. Bidirectional plane wave decomposition

The bidirectional plane wave decomposition was introduced by Besieris et al in Ref. [14]

and it has been proved to be useful for description of LW’s. It is based on a decomposition

of the solutions of the scalar wave equations into the forward and backward traveling plane

wave solutions, in this representation the general solution to the scalar wave equation can

be written in the form (Eq. 2.22 of Ref. [14])

III. A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO SCALAR

FWM’S

A. Propagation invariance of scalar wave ﬁelds

1. The angular spectrum of plane waves of the FWM’s

First of all, in literature the term FWM has been used mostly with the following closed-

form solution of the scalar homogeneous wave equation:

Ψf (ρ, z, ϕ, t) = exp [iβ (z + ct)]

(29)

4πi (a1 + iζ)

exp

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

(Eq. (2.1) of Ref. [18]). The Weyl and Whittaker type plane wave spectrums of this wave

ﬁeld have been derived in Refs. [14, 18] and, omitting the normalizing constants, the latter

reads

In this respect one can say that the following derivation of the angular spectrum of plane

waves of the FWM’s is nothing but the diﬀerent interpretation of the results already pub-

lished. However, the alternate emphasis in the theory, described in this section (and pub-

lished in Ref. [53]), have proved to make the diﬀerence if the optical generation of the FWM’s

is under discussion. Also, the term FWM will be redeﬁned in what follows.

Consider the general solution of the free-space wave equation represented as the Whittaker

type plane wave decomposition Eq. (17)

The integral representation of fundamental FWM’s can be derived from the condition that

the superposition of Bessel beams in Eq.(31) should form a nondispersing pulse propagating

along the z axis. In terms of group velocity dispersion of wave packets this condition means

that the on-axis group velocity vg = dω/dkz should be constant over the whole spectral

range. This restriction allows non-trivial solutions only if we assume that the cone angle

in relation kz = k cos θ is a function of the wave number, i.e., one can write θ (k). The

corresponding support of the angular spectrum of the plane wave constituents of the pulse,

i.e., the volume of the k-space where the angular spectrum of plane waves of the wave ﬁeld

is not zero, is a cylindrically symmetric surface in the k-space and the angular spectrum can

be expressed by means of Dirac delta function as An (k, θ) = Bn (k) δ [θ

correspondingly (see Fig. 2 of the section III A 3 for the set of special cases).

As kz = k cos θ, our result (40) is consistent with the support of angular spectrum of

plane waves of the original FWM’s in Eq. (30), the constant γ just generalizes to include also

FWM’s of diﬀerent group velocities. Thus, we can conclude that the physically transparent

condition (32) indeed determines the support of the angular spectrum of plane waves of the

The applied condition (32) implies that the longitudinal shape of the central peak of the

pulsed wave ﬁeld in Eqs. (42) – (45) do not spread as it propagates in z axis direction.

From the integral expressions it is also obvious that the pulse do not spread in transversal

direction. However, the wave ﬁeld has what has been called the ”local variations” – the

term exp [

i2γβz] in (43) implies that only the instantaneous intensity of the wave ﬁeld

is independent of the propagation distance, in what follows we refer to such wave ﬁelds as

−

propagation-invariant.

It is important to note that in Eqs. (40), (41) and (42) – (45) the frequency spectrum is

arbitrary. Thus, the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the propagation-invariance of the

general pulsed wave ﬁeld (31) is that its support of angular spectrum of plane waves should

be deﬁned by Eq. (34) or (37). The statement can also be inverted and one can say that the

wave ﬁeld is strictly propagation-invariant only if its support of angular spectrum of plane

waves is deﬁned by Eq. (40) or (41) – indeed, in Eq. (32) any other choice would lead to

the group velocity dispersion and the pulse would inevitably spread as it propagates. This

also implies, that all the possible solutions of scalar homogeneous wave equation that have

20

extended depth of propagation as compared to ordinary Gaussian pulses (see next chapter)

should be considered as certain approximations to the FWM’s.

Now, the closed-form expressions like (29) are very convenient in numerical analysis,

however, limiting ourselves to the set of available closed-form integrals of (42) – (45) is not

reasonable by any means. In this review we use the term ”focus wave modes” (FWM) for

all the wave ﬁelds that can be represented by the integral expressions (42) – (45), whereas

the closed-form expression (29) will be called the original FWM.

3. A physical classiﬁcation of FWM’s

The recognition, that the spatiotemporal behavior of FWM’s is determined only by the

support of their angular spectrum of plane waves enables one to give a straightforward

general classiﬁcation to the FWM’s.

Note, the dispersion relation

χ2 + k2

z −

2

ω
c

(cid:16)
can be interpreted as a deﬁnition of a cone in (χ, kz, k) space [15] (see Fig. 2). In this context

(cid:17)

the speciﬁc supports of the angular spectrum of plane waves of FWM’s in Eqs. (32) – (38)

have a geometrical interpretation as being the cone sections of (46) along the planes

(33) or

kz = γk

−

kz (k) = γk

(36).

It can be seen that the possible supports of the angular spectrums of plane waves

can be divided into four explicit special cases (see Fig. 2) that can be taken as the natural

classiﬁcation of the FWM’s:

1. β = 0 (ξ = 0), γ

1, the support is a cone in k-space, typical examples are Bessel-X

scalar wave equation. This point has to be stressed as the straightforward basic idea we set

forward here is often elusive in the general literature and numerous closed form LW’s have

been set forward.

a. Pulsed localized wave ﬁelds in dispersive media It should be noted at this point that,

in principle, the approach can be used to derive propagation-invariant wave ﬁelds for linear

dispersive media. In this case we should replace kz by kzn (ω) in Eqs. (32) – (35), n (ω)

being the refractive index of the medium. This modiﬁcation yields the following equation

for the support of the angular spectrum of plane waves of the FWM in linear dispersive

media:

c being the velocity of light in vacuum. Eq. (49) deﬁnes the support of angular spectrum

of plane waves to the wave ﬁeld that propagates without any longitudinal or transversal

spread in linear dispersive media. This approach – to use predetermined angular dispersion

to suppress the longitudinal (and transversal) dispersion, though diﬀerently formulated, has

been already used in Refs. [122, 123, 187] for example.

4. The temporal evolution of the FWM’s in the radial direction

The temporal evolution of the FWM’s in the radial direction can be given a conve-

nient mathematical interpretation. Namely, as Ch´avez-Cerda et al noted in Ref. [69] the

monochromatic Bessel beam can be represented as a superposition of so-called Hankel waves

Ψ(1)

m (ρ, z, t) = H (1)

m (χρ) exp [ikzz

iωt + imϕ]

Ψ(2)

m (ρ, z, t) = H (2)

m (χρ) exp [ikzz

iωt + imϕ] ,

−

−

where

are the m-th order Hankel functions and Nm denotes the m-th order Neumann function (the

Bessel function of the second kind). For monochromatic wave ﬁelds the two solutions deﬁne

H (1)

m (χρ) = Jm (χρ) + iNm (χρ)

H (2)

m (χρ) = Jm (χρ)

iNm (χρ)

23

(50a)

(50b)

(51b)

the diverging and converging wave in xy plane, in other terms, they form the ”sink” and

”source” pair. In those terms the m-th order Bessel beam can be written as

Jm (χρ) exp [ikzz

iωt + imϕ] =

−
m (χρ) + H (2)
H (1)

m (χρ)

exp [ikzz

iωt + imϕ]

−

(52)

– this is a standing wave that arise in the superposition of the two Hankel waves (note how

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

the singularity of the Neumann functions at the origin is eliminated).

This approach can be easily generalized for the wideband wave ﬁelds – in this case the

superposition of the monochromatic Hankel beams form a converging or expanding circular

pulse in the xy plane. If we also use condition (40) we get the pulse that corresponds to

the radial evolution of the FWM’s. The results of a numerical simulation of its behavior are

depicted in Fig. 3a and 3b.

Note also, that the radial wave that propagates away from the z axis is generally not

propagation invariant. Indeed, if we follow the arguments of the section III A 1 for radial

propagation we can write the condition of propagation-invariance as

vg = c

where constant γρ again determines the group velocity. Specifying the integration constant
ξ again from the condition θρ (ξ) = 180◦ we can write for the support of angular spectrum

of plane waves

A typical support of the angular spectrum of plane waves deﬁned by Eq. (54) is depicted

in Fig. 3b. So, the FWM is propagation-invariant in both the z axis direction and radial

direction only in the special case ξ

0 where we can write γρ =

γ2. This consequence

will be given a further interpretation in section III C 1.

5. The spatial localization of FWM’s

For most practical cases there is no closed-form integrals to Eq. (42). Consequently, we

have to deal with integral transforms and the straightforward numerical simulation of any

realistic situation may be a tedious task (this is especially true for general LW’s where the

25

double integrals have to be computed). However, for LW’s there is a simple method for

qualitative estimate of the resulting wave ﬁelds, based on three-dimensional Fourier trans-

forms (the monochromatic case of the approach was introduced by McCutchen in Ref. [188]

and has been used for example in Refs. [189, 190]).

Let us start with Whittaker type plane wave decomposition in Eq. (13) and set t = 0:

estimate the general shape of the wave ﬁeld on z axis and xy plane respectively. If we also

B. Few remarks on properties of FWM’s

1. Causality of FWM’s

In several papers it has been noted, that the original FWM’s introduced by Brittingham

and Ziolkowski in Eq. (29) are not exactly causal as they include backward propagating

plane wave components (see Fig. 5) [13]. This fact is due to the speciﬁc frequency spectrum

(30) that leads to the closed-form FWM’s (see the overview in following chapter). In the

consequent publications (see Ref. [[18]]) Shaarawi et. al. demonstrated, that the parameters

of the spectrum can be chosen so that the predominant part of the energy of the FWM’s is

in forward propagating plane wave components.

In the context of our approach this problem has to be considered as ill-posed – as all

the wave ﬁelds that share the support of the angular spectrum of plane waves (40) are

propagation-invariant regardless of their frequency spectrum, we can just choose one without

the acausal components.

2. FWM’s and evanescent waves

The second topic that is closely related to the backward propagating plane wave compo-

nents of the original FWM’s is the one of evanescent waves [18, 20].

From the practical point of view it may seem peculiar to introduce the evanescent waves,

the intensity of which decays exponentially, in the context of the propagation-invariant wave

ﬁelds where the depth of the propagation usually extend over several meters. However, the

evanescent waves appear indeed in a Weyl picture of the FWM’s. Indeed, from Eqs. (21)

In Eq. (78), for the ranges χ < k the integration is over homogeneous plane waves. For

χ > k, the wave vector of the plane waves is purely imaginary and the integration is over

the evanescent waves [18, 35]. The situation may be more apparent if we transform to

so that the Weyl forward and backward propagating components add up resulting in the

source-free solution in Eq. (42).

Again, in our approach the frequency spectrum is chosen so that the wave ﬁelds do not

have any backward propagating components. Consequently, the integration is only along the

real part of the D+. Also, it is quite clear that for the free-space wave ﬁelds the presence of

the evanescent waves in the integration (80) is rather a peculiarity of the Weyl type angular

spectrum of plane waves. For example, if we write the Weyl picture of a plane wave pulse

propagating perpendicularly to z axis, the corresponding Weyl picture obviously do contain

evanescent components. However, there is no physical content in those components.

3. Energy content of scalar FWM’s

As already noted, the total energy content of FWM’s is inﬁnite [2, 6, 31]. Indeed, as the

due to the δ2 in the integrand (here and hereafter the tilde on angular spectrum indicates that

there is a delta function in the deﬁnition of the angular spectrum of plane waves. Also, it

has been proved that any wave ﬁeld that is strictly propagation-invariant has necessarily

inﬁnite total energy [3, 4].

The second important energetic parameter of the LW’s is their energy ﬂow over a cross-

section per unit time – obviously, any physically feasible wave ﬁeld has to have a ﬁnite energy

quantity can be calculated as

where Az (kx, ky) is again the projection of the angular spectrum of plane waves onto kxky

plane. Obviously the quantity is necessarily inﬁnite, if only the projection of the angular

spectrum can be written in terms of delta function in kxky plane. Otherwise the energy ﬂow

is ﬁnite, provided the function Az (kx, ky) is square integrable. The comparison of Figs. 2

and 4 shows that the FWM’s generally have ﬁnite total energy ﬂow.

In literature the ﬁnite energy LW’s have been constructed for example by means of

superpositions of FWM’s [6, 31] and by applying ﬁnite time windows [45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. In

section. VI C we will describe our approach to this problem as described in Ref. [54].

C. Alternate derivations of scalar FWM’s

1. FWM’s as cylindrically symmetric superpositions of tilted pulses

As to demonstrate the eﬃciency of the integral transform representations in describing

the properties of FWM’s, we give yet another description of FWM’s (Ref. [55]).

Let us represent FWM’s as the cylindrically symmetric superpositions of the interfering

pairs of certain tilted pulses (see also Ref. [52]). In this representation the ﬁeld of the FWM’s

can be expressed as [see Eqs. (15) and (40)]

An example of a tilted pulse with Gaussian frequency spectrum corresponding to approxi-
mately τs ∼
tilted pulses in Eq. (89) and FWM in Eq. (42) are depicted in Fig. 7b).

4f s in Eq. (88) is depicted in Fig. 7a, the corresponding superposition of two

In this representation the properties of FWM’s can be given the following interpretation:

1. The localized central peak of FWM’s is simply the well-known consequence of taking

the axially symmetric superposition of a harmonic function. Indeed, the interference

of the two transform-limited tilted pulses in Eq. (89) gives rise to the harmonic inter-

ference pattern, the transversal width of which is proportional to the temporal length

of the tilted pulses (88). The central peak arises due to the constructive interference

of the tilted pulses along the optical axis, formally, the cos () function in Eq. (89) is

replaced by J0 () in Eq. (42) [see Fig. 7b];

2. The nondispersing propagation of the optical FWM’s wave ﬁelds can be given an

alternate wave-optical interpretation. Namely, it can be seen from Fig. 8, that in large

scale the longitudinal length of the tilted pulses depends on the distance from the

optical axis so that the tilted pulses have a ”waist” (this claim is identical to that

given in section III A 4 that the radial wave propagating toward the z axis and back

is not propagation-invariant). The relation (34) essentially guarantees, that the waist

propagates along the optical axis and do not spread – in this case the central peak of

the corresponding cylindrically symmetric superpositions, FWM’s (42), also remains

transform-limited;

3. The local variations of the central peak of the wave ﬁeld, noted for example in Ref. [6],

can be explained as the result of the diﬀerence between the phase and group velocities

along the optical axis – as can be seen from Fig. 7c the pulse and phase fronts of the

tilted pulses are not parallel;

4. The group velocity of the wave ﬁeld can be set by changing the parameter γ in Eq. (34).

The Fig. 7c gives this eﬀect a wave optical interpretation – it can be seen, that the on-

axis group velocity of the wave ﬁeld directly depends on the angle between the phase

front and pulse front and on the direction of the wave vector of the mean frequency.

It is easy to see, that all the presented arguments are equally valid for the superpositions

of tilted pulses in Eq. (89) and for its cylindrically symmetric counterparts – FWM’s. Thus,

we can state that the deﬁned interfering pair of tilted pulses possess all the characteristic

properties of FWM’s. In fact, the physics behind the two wave ﬁelds is similar to the degree,

that we will call the wave ﬁeld (89)

If one compares the Eqs. (98) - (100) to those of the monochromatic Gaussian beam (see

Ref. [166] for example) one can see that, the FWM’s can be interpreted as moving, modulated

Gaussian beams for which a1 (ζ) and R (ζ) are the beam width and radius of curvature

respectively and W0 is the beam waist at ζ = 0 (see Refs. [3, 5, 6] for relevant descriptions).

Now, several interesting consequences can be drawn at this point. Most importantly, this

formal analogy between the FWM’s and Gaussian beams is very conditional and even mis-

leading in some respects. First of all, the constant β is by no means the carrier wave number

of the FWM’s as one might expect from the corresponding monochromatic expression – in

the following Chapter IV we will see that the convenient choice of parameter for optically
feasible FWM’s with the carrier wave number k0 ≈
of magnitude β . 100 rad

m the parameter is of the order
m . Secondly, the requirement of optical feasibility also implies that

λ. So that we have a limiting case where the waist of the Gaussian beam is much

Next we would like to discuss the claim, often encountered in literature, that the original

FWM’s are carrier free wave ﬁelds. First of all, in lights of the general physical considerations

in section III A 5 it should be evident that the non-oscillating shape of the central peak in

Fig. 10 is a direct consequence of the ultra-wide frequency spectrum of the wave ﬁeld –

if the pulse length of the corresponding source plane wave pulse is less than the central

wavelength, the resulting FWM is eﬀectively an half-cycle pulse and in this condition the

concept of carrier wavelength is rather meaningless of course. However, in above sections

it was shown that the general FWM’s are not conﬁned to the one particular frequency

spectrum. Correspondingly, we can choose a feasible frequency spectrum and the carrier

free behaviour of the original FWM’s should certainly not be mentioned as the deﬁning

property of the original FWM’s, this is just a mathematical peculiarity of a particular

integral transform table entry.

The issue can be given an alternate description if we note that, using the analogy to the

in the expression Eq. (98) could be interpreted as the Gouy phase shift [[166]] of the FWM’s.

In previous section III C 1 we described the FWM’s as the cylindrically symmetric superposi-

tions of certain tilted pulses. Now, the original FWM’s diﬀer from those, depicted in Fig. 7b

only by the ultra-wide bandwidths. In Fig. (11) we have depicted the on-axis spatial evo-

lution of an FWM as described by Eq. (98) and of one of reasonable bandwidth, calculated

from the Eq. (42). The comparison of the two waveforms shows that term exp

h

due to the ultra-wide bandwidth and the term exp [i2βz] is added as the monothonically

growing phase factor that is due to the diﬀerence between the group and phase velocities of

FWM’s. The latter term is characteristic to the FWM’s only – instead of having a single

focus with accompanying Gouy phase shift or a ”frozen” Gouy phase shift as the X-type

pulses, FWM’s have periodically evolving phase shift term.

The idea of Gouy phase shift, initially introduced in the Fresnel approximation of the

diﬀraction theory of monochromatic focused beams, has attracted a renewed interest recently

in the context of propagation of subcycle Gaussian pulses (see Refs. [131, 132, 133, 138, 140,

144, 146]). We believe, that the simple physical interpretation of the term (101) in the

context of FWM’s, as being the result of the diﬀerence between phase and group velocities

of the wave ﬁeld, might add to the general understanding of the phenomenon.

3. FWM’s as the Lorentz transforms of focused monochromatic beams

An interesting interpretation to the FWM’s can be given in terms of special theory of

relativity. Namely, in Ref. [5] B´elanger demonstrated that Gaussian monochromatic beams

appear as FWM’s (Gaussian packetlike beams) when observed in an inertial system moving

at relativistic speeds relative to the focused wave. In this short note we would like to give

an another mathematical representation to this claim.

Suppose we take a focused monochromatic wave of the form

suﬀer from the relativistic Doppler shift. As the result, their wave vectors and frequencies

transform as described by Lorentz transformations. Speciﬁcally, the wave number of the

wave vector and its longitudinal and transversal components in the inertial frame, moving

of plane waves of the wave ﬁeld in the moving frame is the one of the FWM that moves in

negative direction of z axis – for the FWM’s we have in Eq. (33)

kz = γk

2βγ

−

and using both k0 and V as parameters we can model every possible support of angular

spectrum of plane waves of FWM’s. In Fig. 12 the support of angular spectrum of plane

waves of the beam as seen from the moving reference system is depicted for various values

of the speed V and ﬁxed value for k0.

Note that an alternate approach to describe the LW’s in terms of generalized Lorentz

transforms can be found in Ref. [35] – in this work it was shown that the superluminal and

subluminal Lorentz transformations can be used to derive LW solutions to the scalar wave

equation by boosting known solutions of the wave equation.

4. FWM’s as a construction of generalized functions in the Fourier domain

In Refs. [15, 16] Donnelly and Ziolkowski realized, that various separable and non-

separable solutions to the wave equation can be constructed in spatial and temporal Fourier

domain by choosing the Fourier transform of the solution of the diﬀerential equation so that,

when multiplied by the transform of the particular diﬀerential operator, it gives zero in the

sense of generalized functions. In the special case of scalar homogeneous wave equation the

corresponding relation reads

where ψ (k, ω) (9) is (3+1) dimensional Fourier transform of the solution of the wave equation

angular spectrum of plane waves, derived in section III A 1.

IV. AN OUTLINE OF SCALAR LOCALIZED WAVES STUDIED IN LITERA-

TURE SO FAR

A.

Introduction

Over the years a considerable eﬀort has been made to ﬁnd closed-form localized solutions

to the homogeneous scalar wave equations. The main aim of this work is to study the

feasibility of LW’s in optical domain. Without debasing the value of those solutions it

appears, that this approach often leads to the source schemes that are diﬃcult to realize

even in radio frequency domain.

Though there has been several publications that provide an uniﬁed approach for the

description of LW’s [15, 31, 35], to our best knowledge, the optical feasibility of those wave

ﬁelds has not been estimated in literature. Moreover, the analysis of the numerical examples

that have been published in literature show, that authors have often choose the parameters

of the LW’s so that the frequency spectrum is in the radio frequency domain.

In our opinion in optical domain the best representation for the analysis is the Whittaker

type plane wave decomposition. First of all, the mental picture of the Fourier lens that

produces the two-dimensional Fourier transform of monochromatic wave ﬁeld between its

focal planes is often very useful in modeling the optical setups – we precisely know, how and

in what approximations the elementary components of the Fourier picture, the plane waves

and Bessel beams, can be generated. Secondly, the approach of the section III A 5 allows us

easily estimate the spatial shape of the wave ﬁelds under the discussion.

In the following overview we deﬁne the term ”optically feasible” by two rather obvious

restrictions:

1. The frequency spectrum of an optically feasible wave ﬁeld should be in optical domain;

2. The plane wave spectrum of an optically feasible wave ﬁeld should not contain plane

waves propagating at non-paraxial angles relative to optical axis.

44

The latter requirement can be justiﬁed by a very simple geometrical estimate, described

in Fig. 29 – if the FWM’s has to propagate over distances that exceed the diameter of the

source more than, say, ﬁve times, the maximum angle of the plane wave components in the

wave ﬁeld has to be less than 5 degrees.

Note, that the energy content of most of the wave ﬁelds discussed in this outline is

inﬁnite, thus, they are not physically realizable as such. However, as we will see in chapters

that follow, in optical implementations the ﬁnite energy approximations of the LW’s follow

naturally from the ﬁnite aperture of the setups and this approximation do not change the

general properties of the LW’s, so that the two conditions for optical feasibility, posed here,

are also valid for LW’s with ﬁnite energy content.

In our numerical examples we try to optimize the parameters of each LW so that (i)

the frequency spectrum of the wave ﬁelds extends from

0.5

107rad/m (

wavelength) to

2

107rad/m (

which the length of the corresponding plane wave pulse is

angle

0.2◦ relative to the propagation axis, giving σz/σρ ≈

0.003 for the approximate ratio

of pulse widths in xy and z direction. Note, that specifying the frequency range and cone

angle of the Bessel beam of central wavelength completely determines the parameter β – for

(as compared to (17) here we have taken into account the 1/k term that appears in (12) as

(cid:20)

(117)

[the signiﬁcance of the factor k sin θF (k) will be discussed in following sections].

The frequency spectrum ˜B (k) in Eq. (117) has two free parameters, a1 and β, the latter

having the same deﬁnition as in Eq. (30) of section III A 1. As we already noted in the

introduction of this chapter, the choice γ = 1 together with the frequency range and cone

angle of the Bessel beam of central wavelength determines β = 40rad/m. The single free

parameter is a1 and a single parameter does not allow to approximate for any realistic light

sources – Fig. 13b shows a typical spectrum that can be modeled in terms of Eq. (117) as

compared to the optically feasible frequency spectrum speciﬁed in the introduction of this

overview and it can be seen, that the bandwidth of the wave ﬁeld is far beyond the reach

of any realistic light source. In fact, due to this extraordinary large bandwidth the original

FWM’s in Eq. (113) are essentially half-cycle pulses, as already noted in section III C 2.

As deduced in section III C 2 (and also in terms of the section III A 5), the parameter a1

In literature it has been argued, that the FWM’s determined by Eq. (113) are nonphysical

as the wave ﬁeld contain acausal components. In the discussion of Ref. [18] it has been shown

that the acausality can be eliminated by proper choice of parameters a1 and β – it has been

shown that if βa1 < 1, the predominant contribution to the spectrum comes from the plane

waves moving in positive z axis direction. In Fig 13b it can be seen, that this is indeed

the case, however the ﬁeld is still far from convenient for any optical implementation due to

ultra-wide bandwidth.

47

Note, that various closed-form sub- and superluminal FWM’s (γ

= 1) have been derived

for example in Ref. [15].

C. Bessel-Gauss pulses

The Bessel-Gauss pulses were introduced by Overfelt in Ref. [33] (see also Refs. [15, 50,

51]). In this publication it was shown, that the scalar wave ﬁeld

where the physical meaning of the parameters a1, β, also ζ and µ is consistent with the

previous discussion. The expression has an additional free parameter κ as compared to the

FWM’s in (113), in fact, the latter is the special case of the former in the limiting case

0. The Bessel-Gauss pulses were further investigated in Ref. [15] where it was shown,

that in Fourier picture as in Eq. (9) the spatiotemporal Fourier transform of the ﬁeld can

(see section III C 4 for the notation). From Eq. (119) it can be seen that the support of the

plane wave spectrum of the Bessel-Gauss pulses is the same as described by Eq. (34) [or

In the original paper the Bessel-Gauss pulses were introduced as the wave ﬁelds that

are ”more highly localized than the fundamental Gaussian solutions because of its extra

spectral degree of freedom”. The additional free parameter is indeed advantageous, however,

in our opinion not in the sense proposed in this publication – the spatial localization of any

wideband free-space wave ﬁeld is directly proportional to its bandwidth and the latter is

inappropriately large even for the original FWM’s (see Ref. [15] for a related discussion). It

may be the consequence of this general emphasis of the original paper that it is not generally

recognized that the extra parameter κ in Eqs. (118) – (121) gives one the necessary degree

of freedom to ﬁt an arbitrary bandlimited Gaussian-like spectrum – from Eq. (121) it can be

seen, that the central frequency and bandwidth of the spectra of the pulse are independently

adjustable by the parameters κ and a1 respectively.

Analogously to the discussion in section III C 2 the Bessel-Gauss pulses can be given the

form that, in some respect, resembles that of the monochromatic Gaussian beam:

The general form of the Bessel-Gauss pulses (122) is very advantageous in the sense that

here we can actually write out its carrier wave number – often this quantity is elusive for

the wideband wave ﬁelds. Indeed, around the point ζ = 0, along the optical axis (ρ = 0)

with (123a) we can write for the z axis component of the carrier wave number

This result is actually quite signiﬁcant, if we once more remind that in literature the FWM’s

have often been termed as carrier-free wave ﬁelds (see Refs. [47, 49] for example). In lights

of (124) we can conclude that the carrier-free behaviour of the FWM’s is indeed caused by

the integral transform table, not by physical arguments.

In the numerical example in Fig. 14 we have optimized the parameters of the wave ﬁeld as

to match the spectral band speciﬁed in the introduction of this section. Again, the parameter

In conclusion, the Bessel-Gauss pulses are obviously much more appropriate for modeling

realistic experimental situations.

D. X-type wave ﬁelds

The X-type localized wave ﬁelds are characterized by that for their angular spectrum of

plane waves β = 0 in Eq. (34) [or ξ = 0 in Eq. (37)]. This choice implies, that their support

of angular spectrum of plane waves is a cone in k-space (see Fig. 2). Consequently, the phase

and group velocity of X-type pulses are equal (both necessarily superluminal) and the ﬁeld

propagates without any local changes along the optical axis.

1. Bessel beams

ﬁeld reads as

The Bessel beams [57]–[97] are the simplest special case of the propagation-invariant wave

ﬁelds. Being the exact solutions to the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates their

In the Fourier picture, the zeroth–order Bessel beam is the cylindrically symmetric super-

position of the monochromatic plane waves propagating at angles θ0 relative to z axis,

correspondingly, their angular spectrum of plane waves in Eq. (18) reads

are very well understood today. The interest has been triggered in Refs. [57, 58] where

Durnin et al presented them as ”nondiﬀracting” solutions of the homogeneous scalar wave

equation – they demonstrated experimentally, that the central maximum of the Bessel beams

propagates much further than the Rayleigh range predicts.

Note, that though there has been numerous experiments on Bessel beams, they are not

realizable in experiment in the exact form (126) – indeed, the analysis of section III B 3

52

immediately shows, that this wave ﬁeld has both inﬁnite total energy and energy ﬂow over

its cross-section. We will discuss this point in what follows.

In this review the Bessel beams appear as the components of the Fourier decomposition

in Eqs. (15) – (17) for example. Later in this review we will refer to their most important

properties in some detail. At this point we just depict its angular spectrum of plane waves

with the typical ﬁeld distribution (see Fig. 15).

2. X-pulses

in representation (18) with the frequency spectrum

yields the propagation-invariant wave ﬁeld

(see Ref. [107] for the description of higher order X-pulses). From the angular spectrum in

i (z cos θ0 −

ΨX (ρ, z, t) =

(130)

q

Eq. (128) it can be seen, that the support of angular spectrum of plane waves of the X-pulses

is a cone in k-space, i.e., all the plane wave components of the wave ﬁeld propagate at the

equal angle from the propagation axis. The frequency spectrum of X-pulses in Eq. (128) is

uniform (see Fig. 16a) – the immediate conclusion of the approach of section III A 5 that

the corresponding ﬁeld should have exponentially decaying behaviour in both z axis and xy

plane is conﬁrmed in Fig. 16c.

X-wave ﬁelds have been further investigated in Refs. [105, 106, 107, 108], recently the

topic have been given an overview and general description in Ref. [111]. We mention here

the so called bowtie waves that are generally introduced as the derivatives of the X-waves:

ΨmX (ρ, z, t) =

∂mΨ′ (r, t)
∂xm

.

(131)

The derivatives of X-waves have been shown to possess non-symmetric nature and have

extended localization along a radial direction.

(132)

so that the angular spectrum of plane waves of such wave ﬁelds is not cylindrically symmetric,

correspondingly the wave ﬁeld is a superposition of higher order monochromatic Bessel

beams as described by Eq. (19) for example.

Due to the exponential shape of the frequency spectrum the X-waves are not appropriate

for optical implementation.

3. Bessel-X pulses

The Bessel-X pulses were introduced by Saari in Ref. [120, 121] as the bandlimited version

of X-pulses. Their angular spectrum of plane waves can be described as

Note, that the special case ξ = 0 yields the cylindrically symmetric superposition of plane

wave pulses propagating perpendicularly to z axis.

The support of the angular spectrum of plane waves of the wave ﬁeld (146) is depicted

in Fig. 18a. From the estimates of the spatial localization of LW’s in section III A 5 we can

expect the wave ﬁeld to be localized in transversal direction at t = 0, z = 0 and to be

uniform along the z axis. Indeed, from the Fig. 18c it can be seen that at this space-time

point the wave ﬁeld (146) is an approximation to ”light ﬁlament” along the optical axis.

The temporal evolution of the wave ﬁeld is depicted in Fig. 18d. One can see, that the

eﬀect of the inﬁnite group velocity is that the light ﬁlament is focused only at a single time

t = 0 and extends from

to

. As to relate to the conventional wave optics, the temporal

−∞

∞

evolution of the light ﬁlament is a close relative to that of the plane wave pulse in a plane

perpendicular to its wave vector.

As the wave ﬁeld includes both non-optical frequencies and non-paraxial angles it is not

optically feasible as such. However, it can be shown that a ﬁnite energy approximation to

the light ﬁlament can in principle be generated by a cylindrical diﬀraction grating.

2. Pulsed wave ﬁelds with frequency-independent beamwidth

In Ref. [36] Campbell et al introduced a wideband wave ﬁeld that is a superposition of

the Bessel beams the cone angle of which is chosen so that the condition

k sin θ (k) = α0 = const

(147)

is satisﬁed for entire bandwidth. The condition (147) implies, that the transversal component

of the wave vector of every plane wave component of the wave ﬁeld is α0, the corresponding

wave ﬁeld was called as the pulsed wave ﬁelds with frequency independent beamwidth. The

angular spectrum of plane waves for such choice can be written as

The support of the angular spectrum of plane waves of the wave ﬁeld Eq. (149) is depicted

in Fig. 19 (in the numerical example the frequency spectrum B (k) is Gaussian with the

bandwidth corresponding to

6f s pulse). Using the approach of section III A 5 one can

∼

immediately tell the general spatial shape of such wave ﬁelds. Indeed, in this case we have

a simple special case, where the projection of the angular spectrum of plane waves onto the

kxky-plane is delta-ring, correspondingly, the ﬁeld in transversal direction at z = 0, t = 0

should be of the shape of the Bessel function. As for longitudinal shape, its envelope is

determined by the bandwidth by it Fourier transform, i.e., we should have a slice of a Bessel

beam. The numerical simulation in Fig. 19d shows that this estimate is true. Also, one can

see that the wave ﬁeld has generally inﬁnite energy ﬂow.

Comparing the support in Eq. (148) to that of the propagation-invariant pulsed wave

ﬁeld in Eq. (34) and (40) one can see, that the wave ﬁeld (149) is not propagation-invariant.

Consequently, the localized part of the wave ﬁeld spreads as it propagates. We can also

suggest the best condition for limited propagation-invariance – the comparison of the support

in Fig. 19a to those of FWM’s in Fig. 2 implies that for restricted bandwidths the support

(147) could be optimized to approximate the ”horizontal” part of the ellipsoidal supports of

the subluminal FWM’s (γ > 1).

F. Physically realizable approximations to FWM’s

As it was explained in section III A 5, the presence of the delta function in the support of

the angular spectrum of plane waves of the free-space scalar wave ﬁelds necessarily results

in inﬁnite total energy content of the wave ﬁeld. Consequently, for all the above reviewed

wave ﬁelds the total energy content is inﬁnite,

1. Electromagnetic directed-energy pulse trains (EDEPT)

One approach has been to construct various continuous superpositions of FWM’s (113)

of the angular spectrum of the FWM’s for diﬀerent values of parameter β generally do not

overlap and change smoothly in k-space, the integration indeed eliminates the delta function

in the expression for angular spectrum of plane waves (see Fig. 20). It can be shown [31] that

Eq. (152) yields ﬁnite total energy wave ﬁeld if only the function Λ (β) satisﬁes condition

(see Eq. 2.8 of Ref. [31]), i.e., if only β−1/2Λ (β) is square integrable. The LW’s of the general

form (152) have been called EDEPT solutions of the scalar wave equation.

From the discussion of previous chapters it is obvious, that the wave ﬁeld of the general

form (152) are not strictly propagation-invariant. At ﬁrst glance it may seem surprising

because (i) FWM solutions with diﬀerent values of parameter β do travel without any

spread and (ii) all the FWM’s overlap in every space-time point as their group velocities

are equal. However, the eﬀect can be easily understood if we recollect from section III C 1

that the phase velocities of the pulses are diﬀerent leading to the z axis position dependent

interference and spread of the superposition of the component pulses (see Ref. [3, 4] for

alternate proofs of this claim).

a. Modiﬁed power spectrum pulse (MPS) The modiﬁed power spectrum pulses [31]

have been introduced by the following bidirectional plane wave spectrum (see Eq. (3.3) of

Ref. [31] and Eq. (3.32) of Ref. [14])

The comparison of the bidirectional plane wave spectra of MPS (155) with that of the

FWM’s (114) one can see, that the latter is a special case a2 = 0, q = 1 of the former.

Consequently, the parameter a1 in (155) has the same interpretation as in case of FWM’s

– it determines the frequency spectra of the wave ﬁeld. From (156) it is also obvious that

the parameter a2 determines the width of the β distribution and parameter b determines

the central value of β. As for parameter q, it can be used to optimize the shape of the β

64

distribution.

A numerical example of the MPS is depicted in Fig. 21.

In this example we tried to

optimize the parameters so as to satisfy the conditions for optical feasibility as stated in the

introduction of this overview. From the angular spectrum of plane waves in Fig. 21a one can

see, that the MPS’s generally have the same inconvenience as FWM’s – there no freedom to

choose the frequency spectrum as to optimize for any convenient light source and they are

generally half-cycle pulses.

For an interpretation of MPS’s as being the ﬁeld generated by a combined point-like

source and a sink placed at a complex-number coordinate see Refs. [144, 146]

It is not our aim at this point to study the temporal behaviour of the EDEPT solutions,

thus, the wave ﬁeld is calculated only for the time t = 0.

2. Splash pulses

Splash pulses [6] appear if one chooses the bidirectional plane wave spectrum as (Eq. (3.13)

FWM and the parameters a2 and q determine the distribution function over the parameter
˜β. The integration in the bidirectional plane wave decomposition (22) can be carried out to

yield (Eq. (3.19) of Ref. [14], Eq. (17) of Ref. [6])

The wave ﬁeld has been called as ”splash pulse” in Ref. [6] as for its characteristic spatial

shape. However, in our numerical example we tried once more to ﬁnd a set of parameters

suitable for optical generation.

It appeared (see Fig. 22), that in this case the angular

spectrum of plane waves is very similar to that of the MPS’s as in Fig. 21.

G. Several more LW’s

To date, the literature on LW’s and on propagation of ultrashort electromagnetic pulses

is overwhelming and this overview is by no means complete. Our aim was to demonstrate

the applicability of our approach on most important special cases.

As already mentioned, in Ref. [35] Besieris et al derived several closed-form superluminal

and subluminal LW solutions to the scalar wave equation by ”boosting” known solutions of

other Lorentz invariant equations.

In section III C 4, we already reviewed the approach of solving the homogeneous scalar

wave equation and Klein-Gordon equation, introduced in Refs. [15, 16] by Donnelly and Zi-

66

olkowski. In those works, they also deduced various closed-form separable and non-separable

solutions to the wave equation.

In Ref. [32] Overfelt found a continua of localized wave solutions to the scalar homoge-

neous wave, damped wave, and Klein-Gordon equations by means of a complex similarity

transform technic.

The numerous publications that are involved with ultrashort-pulse solutions of the time-

dependent paraxial wave equation (e.g. isodiﬀracting pulses) should be mentioned here (see

Refs. [132]–[146] and references therein).

H. On the transition to the vector theory

Even though the scalar theory is often used in description of propagation of electromag-

netic wave ﬁelds, generally the solutions to the Maxwell equations have to be used. However,

the latter approach is generally much more involved.

In the context of this review, we investigate the free-space wave ﬁelds and mostly use

the angular spectrum representation of the wave ﬁelds. In this context the limitations of

the scalar theory can be easily formulated – the scalar theory is reasonably accurate if only

the plane wave components of the wave ﬁeld propagate at small (paraxial) angles relative

to optical axis (see Wolf and Mandel [163], for example).

In this review we investigate

the possibilities of optical generation of FWM’s (and LW’s), correspondingly, the above

formulated restriction is satisﬁed in all practical cases and we can restrict ourselves to scalar

(Of course, this is not the case with the original FWM’s and LW’s published in literature

– the plane wave components of those wave ﬁelds propagate even perpendicularly to the

direction of propagation and in their exact description the transition to the vector theory is

theory.

obligatory.)

The vector theory of FWM’s and LW’s has been formulated and used in several publi-

cations [1, 2, 3, 8, 31, 109, 128, 130, 131]. The preferred approach has been the use of the

Hertz vectors as formulated in Eqs. (7a) and (7b). One can refer to the theory expounded

67

by Ziolkowski [31] where he used the Hertz vectors of the form

Π(e) = z ΨF

Π(m) = z ΨF ,

(161a)

(161b)

where z is the unit vector along the propagation axis and ΨF is the (localized) solution of

the scalar wave equation. With (161a) and (161b) one get TE or TM ﬁeld with respect to z

respectively. A more general treatment can be found in Ref. [131], where the Hertz vectors

are written as the superpositions of the solutions of scalar wave equation Ψi as

Π(m) = x

results in very complex formulas.

The intuitive analysis of the eﬀect of the transfer to exact vector theory that is more in

the spirit of this review can be carried out in terms of the results that have been published

on vector Bessel beams in Refs. [125, 126, 129, 169]. For example, the result in Ref. [169]

reveals, that for TE and TM ﬁelds the vector Bessel beams retain their paraxial-Bessel beam
14◦ and this result indeed amply justiﬁes the use of the scalar

nature up to cone angles

theory in this review.

1. The derivation of vector FWM’s by directly applying the Maxwell’s equations

To ﬁnish this chapter we nevertheless advance in some extent the second approach men-

tioned in Sec. II A, where we gave the general expression for the plane wave decomposition

of the solution of the free-space Maxwell equations.

To ﬁnd the vector form for the FWM’s as described in Eq. (42) we use the Eqs. (3a) –

(5c). In correspondence with Eq. (35) we choose

We also note, that in addition to the TM and TE wave ﬁelds azimuthally polarized,

radially polarized and circularly polarized vector FWM’s can be derived [169].

I. Conclusions.

The main conclusion of this section are:

1. At this point it should be clear, that all the possible closed-form FWM’s can be

analyzed in a single framework where the support of the angular spectrum of plane

waves (34) – (40) is the only deﬁnitive property for propagation-invariance. The

question of whether an integration over the support has or has not a closed-form

result is the question of mathematical convenience only.

2. With a proper choice of parameters some of the closed form FWM’s (Bessel-Gauss

pulses, Bessel-X) are well suited for use as the models for simulating the result of

optical experiments.

In contrary, the LW’s we reviewed here – the MPS’s, splash

pulses and the original FWM’s – are not feasible in this context. Mostly it is because

of the ultra-wide bandwidth and non-paraxial angular spectrum content of the pulses.

3. In our opinion, the procedure of modeling ﬁnite-thickness supports for ﬁnite energy

approximations of FWM’s reviewed in this section lacks a convenient physical interpre-

tation and to estimate its practical value this topic has to be addressed in the context

of a particular launching setup instead.

V. LOCALIZED WAVES IN THE THEORY OF PARTIALLY COHERENT WAVE

FIELDS

Every electromagnetic ﬁeld in nature has some ﬂuctuations associated with it– even the

purest laser light is not exactly coherent. However, in optical region the ﬂuctuations are too

rapid for direct measurement. Their existence can be deduced from suitable experiments

where the correlation between these ﬂuctuations of ﬁeld variables at two or more space-

time points are measured. The second-order coherence theory gives a precise measure of

those correlations for any two space-time points and formulates the dynamic laws which the

corresponding correlation functions obey. It provides a uniﬁed treatment of all well-known

interference and polarization phenomena of traditional optics.

Our interest in introduction of the coherence theory is two-fold. First of all, we can

generalize the concept of propagation-invariance into the more general class of optical ﬁelds

where the (idealistic) fully coherent laser light is but a special case. As the consequence we

not only obtain a more general view of the subject but also a practical approach towards

the experimental evidence of validity of the theory presented above.

In what follows we again conﬁne ourselves to free ﬁelds only, i.e., within the spatiotempo-

ral domain the ﬁelds under investigation do not contain sources (except perhaps at inﬁnity)

and they do not interact with any material objects.

A. Propagation-invariance in domain of partially coherent ﬁelds in second order

coherence theory

1. General deﬁnitions

Let us start with some general notion on the subject (see Ref. [163]). The deﬁnitive

characteristics of a (generally) stochastic wave ﬁeld in second order coherence theory is

the ensemble cross-correlation function, often named as mutual coherence function for two

points that can be deﬁned as

Γ (r1, r2, t1, t2) =

V ∗(r1, t1)V (r2, t2)
h

ie .

(177)

In this equation V (r, t) is the (complex) ﬁeld of a particular realization of a source-free

scalar ﬁeld and angle brackets denote the averaging over the ensemble of realizations, in

essence the function ”measure” the correlation that exists between the light vibrations of

ﬁeld V (r, t) at the space-time points (r1, t1) and (r2, t2) (in terms of statistics the two could

be called processes). The direct calculation of ensemble averages for such two stochastic

processes generally requires determination of their joint (two-fold) probability densities p2,

with which one can write

Γ (r1, r2, t1, t2) =

1 V2p2 [V ∗

(178)

Z Z

where we have denoted the continuous set of ﬁeld values in the two space-time points as

Vi = V (ri, ti),

i = 1, 2.

(179)

The joint probability density is generally unknown, however, there are several special

cases for which the mutual coherence function can be directly calculated. For example, the

two processes, V1 and V2 can be statistically independent of each other, in this case the joint

probability density is completely separable:

p2 [V ∗

1 , r1, t1; V2r2, t2] = p1 (V ∗

1 , r1, t1) p1 (V2, r2, t2) ,

(180)

so that the mutual coherence function is also separable, giving

(181)

where p1 is the ﬁrst order probability density. The second well-known limiting case is

the complete correlation (or complete mutual coherence) between the two processes. In this

case the knowledge of one process completely determines the second process, so that the two

processes as well as the ﬁeld V (r, t) are non-stochastic in nature. The ﬁrst order probability

density then have to have the form

p1 (V, r,t) = δ (V

Vc (r,t)) ,

(182)

where Vc (r,t) is the deterministic function of the space-time point. For the second order

probability density we have

(187)

and for the mutual coherence function of the coherent wave ﬁeld

Γ (r1, r2, t1, t2) = V ∗

c (r1,t1) Vc (r2,t2) .

(184)

The third special case is the stationary stochastic ﬁeld. The random process is said to be

stationary if all the probability densities governing the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld are invariant

under an arbitrary translation of the origin of time, i.e., if

p1 [V ∗

1 , r1, t] = p1 [V ∗
1 , r1, t1; V2, r2, t2] = p2 [V ∗

p2 [V ∗

1 , r1, t1 + T ]

1 , r1, t1 + T ; V2, r2, t2 + T ] .

In this case the mutual coherence function depends only on the diﬀerence of time, so that

Note, that for the statistically independent processes the conditions (180) and (185) imply

Γ (r1, r2, t2, t1) = Γ (r1, r2, t2 −

that Γ (r1, r2, t1, t2)

The above deﬁnitions are of general nature. Let us now constraint ourselves to the

stochastic superpositions of solutions of scalar wave ﬁelds. In our context we could proceed

as follows. For scalar wave ﬁelds the general stochastic process V (r, t) should satisfy the

homogeneous scalar wave equation and this obviously implies certain restrictions to the form

of the corresponding mutual coherence function. In the context of present study the most

convenient way to introduce them is to represent the ﬁeld as the Whittaker-type plane wave

expansion:

The angular correlation function

() is the ensemble average of the product of the com-

plex amplitudes a () of corresponding plane waves, i.e., it is the measure of correlation

between two plane wave components of the ﬁeld. Note, that the stochasticity in this rep-

resentation lies in the correlation of amplitudes and phases of the strictly monochromatic

plane wave components in diﬀerent realizations of the ﬁeld. In the coherent limit the phases

and amplitudes depend on the parameters in non-stochastic manner and do not depend on

the speciﬁc realization.

In practice the ensemble averages of stationary wave ﬁelds are often replaced by the

corresponding time averages – it can be shown that for certain wave ﬁelds the two averages

are equal, the property is referred to as ergodicity. To this point an apparent contradiction

can be seen in representation (188) – the stochastic part of the deﬁnition, the angular

correlation function a (), do not change in time. Of course, this is primarily the consequences

of the fact that the temporal evolution of a source-free, forward-propagating, scalar wave

ﬁeld is fully determined by its values on a plane. However, to understand how the time

averaging appears in this representation one has to notice that if the ﬁeld is stationary and
the correlations die out suﬃciently rapidly as t2 −
ﬁeld is also ergodic, a single realization of the ﬁeld can be divided up into sections of shorter

r1| → ∞

t1 → ∞

, i.e., if the

r2 −

and

|

lengths that are uncorrelated and contain all the statistical information about a realization.

The time average of the ﬁeld then is the average over those shorter realizations. Note, that

in this picture the stochastic angular spectrum (and angular correlation function), being the

Fourier representation of those shorter sections, depend on time and the time average has

to be interpreted as an average over the angular spectrums of the shorter sections of the

realization.

2. Propagation-invariance in second order coherence theory

The very nature of electromagnetic wave ﬁelds implies that their mutual coherence func-

tion, the correlation of ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld at two space-time points, should be a propa-

gating quantity. Hence, we can also deﬁne the spatial localization of the mutual coherence

function and discuss its spread, either transversal or longitudinal. And this is the point

where one can use the ideas of LW’s in coherent theory– we should ﬁnd the conditions when

the mutual coherence has some localization quality and when the localization is preserved

during the propagation in free space.

The mutual coherence function obeys the coupled wave equations (191). Thus, the lo-

calization and propagation of mutual coherence function obeys the same laws as the ﬁeld

and in complete analogy to the coherent theory in section III A 1 it can be shown that the

instantaneous intensity of a particular stochastic wideband ﬁeld (essentially a trail of pulses)

propagate without change along the z axis only if the monochromatic components of the

ﬁeld are coupled as

aF (k, θ, φ) = a(k, θ, φ)δ [θ

θF (k)] ,

(192)

where the function θF (k) is deﬁned in Eq. 34, correspondingly, for the longitudinal compo-

nent of the wave vectors of plane waves we have

kz = k cos θF (k) = γk

theory in what follows. One can see the intimate relevance between the mathematical

deﬁnitions of coherent and partially coherent theory, the only diﬀerence being the stochastic

nature of the angular spectrum of plane waves for the latter. The direct correspondence

between the two also allows us to transfer the results on ﬁnite energy content LW’s described

above, so that the FWM (194) or (195) is essentially the inﬁnite energy content limit of the

broader class of ﬁelds, LW’s. Here we proceed by studying the consequences of the stochastic

nature of the angular spectrum of plane waves of the partially coherent FWM’s.

(..) do not depend on speciﬁc realization, the statistical, correlation

properties of the ﬁeld have to be determined by the function

, for example, the special

C

case where the function is constant corresponds to full correlation– obviously the integrand

in Eq. (197) is nonzero only for the pairs of plane waves that correlate in diﬀerent realizations

for the ensemble.

To summarize this section we note, that the deﬁning property of the partially coherent

FWM’s is the same as for their fully coherent counterparts: the support of their angular

spectrum of plane waves obeys the linearity condition in Eq. (193). In following section we

discuss several limiting special cases of the angular correlation function in Eq. (199).

Note, that the following approach can be considered as the generalization of the discussion

on monochromatic propagation-invariant wave ﬁelds in Refs. [147, 148, 149].

B. Special cases of partially coherent FWM’s

1. Coherent limit

For fully coherent wave ﬁelds the phases and amplitudes of the plane waves in Eqs. (198)

and (199) are invariant of the speciﬁc realization of the ﬁeld and all the plane wave compo-

nents are fully correlated, hence, the non-factored part of the angular correlation function

can be expressed as

Thus, the factor

(k, φ) as deﬁned in Eq. (199) appears as the plane wave spectrum of the

V

coherent wave ﬁeld the multiplier exp [ib (k, φ)] deﬁning the phase of the monochromatic

components. The ﬁeld (204) could be generated from mode-locked femtosecond laser pulses

in a stable linear-optical setup.

To conclude this section we note, that the Eq. (197) implies that the mutual coherence

function of a nonstationary ﬁeld is generally time-dependent quantity. However in optical

domain the function of the ﬁeld are far too rapid for direct measurement, so, in optical

experiments a time-averaged mutual coherence function appears

Consider the special case where the plane waves of diﬀerent wave number are not corre-

lated, however, the ﬁeld is spatially fully coherent at some particular frequency throughout

a volume, i.e., the ﬁeld is completely coherent in space-fequency domain. In this case the

nonfactored part of the angular correlation function

AF has the form

this result is identical to the time-averaged mutual coherence function in (206).

In general the full coherence of the light in space-frequency domain can be achieved by

ﬁltering the incoherent light from a nearly blackbody source by a small (delta) pinhole. The

corresponding partially coherent FWM’s, described by the Eq. (197) are characterized by

the two properties:

1. Their mutual coherence function depends only on the diﬀerence ∆z, i.e., its is invariant

of the origin on the z axis. This also means, that the mutual coherence function

propagates without change.

2. In general the intensity of the stationary ﬁeld can be expressed by

I (r) = Γ (r, r, 0)

an incoherent angular mixture of fully coherent plane wave pulses and Γ factorizes only

asymptotically in the far ﬁeld. Such ﬁelds might be formed from mode-locked femtosecond

laser pulses in an optical set-up containing elements or parameters which ﬂuctuate (slowly

as compared to the pulse repetition rate) – moving scattering media, etc.

The FWM’s of this type have the following properties:

1. Again, the mutual coherence function propagates without any change. However, the

time origin and the origin on the longitudinal axis is important now as the ﬁeld is not

stationary.

The above equations show, that in case of superposition of completely uncorrelated plane

waves the mutual coherence function Γ is homogeneous and stationary, i.e., it depends only

on diﬀerences of its arguments.

The FWM’s of this type have the following properties:

1. Despite of the complete noncorrelation the mutual coherence function of this type

of partially coherent FWM’s can be localized and it propagates without any change.

Particularly, the ﬁeld is propagation-invariant in the sense that Γ depends on the
longitudinal coordinate z through the diﬀerence z2 −

z1 only.

i.e., it is uniform in space.

This is the ﬁeld, that may be viewed as the opposite of an coherent FWM in variable-

spatial-coherence optics:

its intensity is uniform along all spatial directions and in time,

whereas the sharply peaked behavior, characteristic to FWM’s, reveals itself in the mutual

coherence functions ΓF .

C. Conclusions

In this chapter, we have generalized the concept of propagation-invariance into the domain

of partially coherent wave ﬁelds. In the case of partially coherent LW’s the propagation-

invariant, spatially localized ﬁeld variable is its mutual coherence function. Nevertheless

the mathematical description is similar to that used for coherent wave ﬁelds – the angular

correlation function of the partially coherent LW’s, being the counterpart of the angular

spectrum of plane waves in the second order coherence theory, is deﬁned using principles

known from coherent theory.

VI. OPTICAL GENERATION OF LW’S

A.

Introduction

Despite the extensive theoretical work carried out on FWM’s and LW’s, for the long

time there was very few experimental veriﬁcation of the concept of propagation-invariance

of pulsed wave ﬁelds. The only experimental veriﬁcation on LW’s was the launching the

”acoustic directed energy pulse trains” for ultrasonic waves in water [40, 41]. Theoretically

the problem has been addressed in numerous publications [39]] – [51] very seriously – in

a letter to the author of this review of 17.12.2002 Pierre Hillion wrote: ”Please do accept

my apology but it makes so a long time that I am working with focus wave modes that

I am skeptical on the possibility of man-made focus wave modes; perhaps only Nature in

cosmic events?”.

In the lights of the discussion of the overview in Chapter IV one has

to agree with this opinion, but with the following concretization. In optical domain this

opinion is true because (i) today we do not have a coherent light source that generates

half-cycle pulses in visible region and (ii) due to the non-paraxial angular spectrum of plane

waves the original FWM’s are more like the modes of a cylindrical resonator. However,

in the preceding chapters we have shown, that the two requirements are nothing but the

peculiarities of a closed-form integral of the corresponding general expressions that describe

propagation-invariant pulsed wave ﬁelds.

In this chapter, we demonstrate that the wave

ﬁelds that are essentially the limited-bandwidth modiﬁcations of the original FWM’s can

be generated in optical domain.

Majority of the publications on generation of FWM’s and LW’s (except of course those

dependence of diameter of the chromatic angular slit.

that are the part of this review) have discussed possibilities of launching them from an array

(matrix) of (point) sources. This approach has proved to be very involved – as it has been

noted in literature [42], the LW solutions generally cannot be written as the product of a

function only of time and a function only of space, i.e., the LW solutions are mathematically

nonseparable in the space-time coordinates. As a consequence, if one tries to use the principle

of Huygens and launch the LW’s from a planar source, it appears that each point of this

source have to be driven independently. In other words, the nonseparability of the LW’s

implies that the frequency spectrum of every point-source is diﬀerent and one has to drive

a separately addressable array of wideband Huygens sources with a function identical to a

LW. The analysis presented in literature [49] demonstrates that if we could build that kind

of matrix of sources, the launched wave ﬁeld would be a perfectly causal FWM. The ﬁnite

aperture of the source or the time-limiting of the excitation do not destroy the localized

propagation of the generated pulses.

In optical domain this approach has a fundamental drawback – the frequencies of the wave

ﬁelds are of the order of magnitude 1015Hz and the idea of driving a matrix of independent

ultra-wideband sources in this frequency range cannot be realized in experiment. The minor

deﬁciency is that in the Huygens representation the propagation properties of the LW’s are

not physically transparent in the degree they are in angular spectrum representation.

As an example of an alternative approach, characteristic in optics, consider a setup con-

85

sisting of a Fourier lens of focal length f and of a circularly symmetric mask with transfer

function

t (R, k) = s (k) δ [R

f tan θF (k)] ,

−

(233)

where R is the radial coordinate on the ring and θF (k) is the angular function of a FWM

deﬁned by Eq. (34) – this is essentially an annular ring mask, the diameter of which depends

on the wave number of the light as R (k) = f tan θF (k) (see Fig. 23). It is well known, that

each monochromatic point-source of wave number k at some radial distance ρ on the focal

plane of an ideal the lens results in an apertured plane wave that subtends the angle θF (k)

relative to z axis behind the lens. The angular spectrum of plane waves of the total ﬁeld

then can be described as (here the inﬁnite aperture is assumed)

A0 (k, θ) = s (k) exp [iυ (k)] δ [θ

θF (k)] ,

(234)

−

where υ (k) is some phase factor speciﬁc to the setup. The support of the angular spectrum

of plane waves of the wave ﬁeld is the one of the FWM’s (40). If we also compensate for

the phase factor in Eq. (234) by applying the conjugated phase chirp to the input pulse the

Fourier representation directly suggest that a transform-limited FWM can be generated by

illuminating a ”chromatic” annular ring mask by a speciﬁcally chirped plane wave pulse.

Though such chromatic mask is not very practical either, the advantage of this approach

over the Gaussian aperture [49] in optical domain is obvious – this model is essentially static.

B. Feasible approach to optical generation FWM’s

Let us introduce the general idea in terms of 2D FWM’s as deﬁned in section III C 1.

Consider the pair of plane wave pulses propagating at angles θ0 and

θ0 relative to the

−

optical axis (see Fig. 24a). Obviously we can introduce a tilt into their angular spectrum of

plane waves by means of the angularly dispersive elements like diﬀraction gratings or prisms

(wedges) and provided that the resulting tilted pulses overlap, we can observe the interference

of two tilted pulses in near-axis conical volume [see the striped region in Fig. 24a]. If the

introduced tilt of the plane wave components is such that the condition in the Eq. (34), i.e.,

cos θF (k) =

γ (k

2β)

−
k

(235)

86

is satisﬁed for every k and if we ignore for the while the diﬀractional edge eﬀect that appear

due to the ﬁnite aperture of the optical elements, the interference pattern in the near-axis

volume is that of the 2D FWM.

The cylindrically symmetric case (FWM) can be considered similarly – one has to ﬁnd the

means to generate the superposition of Bessel beams, the support of the angular spectrum

of which satisﬁes condition (235). Also, the use of the angular dispersion of the known

generators of Bessel beams, i.e., the devices that transform a monochromatic plane wave

into a Bessel beam, could be an appropriate idea.

As the ﬁrst step we should generate the cylindrically symmetric counterpart of the pair of

plane wave pulses – the Bessel–X pulse (see section IV D 3). The general approach for this is

quite straightforward – according to (133) we have to use the Bessel beam generator without

any angular dispersion and illuminate it with a wideband pulse. The obvious choice is the

annular slit in the back focal plane of a Fourier lens (see Fig. 25). The simple geometrical

considerations show that in this case the wave ﬁeld behind the lens is the cylindrically

symmetric superposition of plane wave pulses – for the cone angle of the Bessel beam of the

wave number k we ﬁnd sin θ (k) = sin (arctan (D/f ))

sin θ0, where D is the diameter of

≡

the angular slit and f is the focal length of the lens, so that the generated wave ﬁeld can be

approximated by (42)

ΨBX (ρ, z, t) =

dk s (k) J0 (kρ sin θ0) exp [ik (z cos θ0 −

ct)] ,

(236)

∞

0
Z

where s (k) is the frequency spectrum of the source ﬁeld.

Using the Bessel-X pulses as input, the problem of optical generation of FWM’s reduces to

the modeling of a set of diﬀractive elements that transform the conical support of the angular

spectrum of plane waves so that the angular dispersion of the output pulse approximates

the one described by the condition in Eq. (235) and to the ”compression” of the resulting

wave ﬁeld by compensating for the relative phases between its monochromatic components

so that a transform-limited pulse appears on the optical axis.

There are various Bessel beam generators described in literature such as axicons, circular

diﬀraction gratings, etc. (see, e.g., Ref. [57] – [69] and references therein). By illuminating

those elements with a plane-wave pulse, we obviously get a superposition of Bessel beams,

the support of the angular spectrum of which is determined by the wavelength dispersion

of cone angle of the optical element θ (k). For example, an axicon is characterized by

FIG. 24: The general idea for optical generation of the 3D (2D) FWM’s: (a) The FWM generator

waves of the initial wave ﬁeld on the FWM generator (solid line). Here and hereafter the dotted

and we can conclude that ideal Bessel beam generators can be used to design wave ﬁelds

with cylindrically symmetric, two–dimensional supports of angular spectrum. Likewise, a

circular grating yields for the cone angle sin θ (k) = 2π/kd, where d is the grating constant

(ﬁrst–order diﬀraction is assumed). The polychromatic wave ﬁeld can be written as

brought about just to exemplify the use of the angular dispersion in our problem).

The support of angular spectrum of a FWM (34) cannot be approximated by a single

diﬀractive element. However, we will show below that aside from the conventional conﬁgu-

ration, where axicons and circular gratings are used to transform a plane wave into a Bessel

property allows us to use a set of those Bessel beam generators as to design more complex

supports of the angular spectrum.

superposition of two conical waves, as shown in Fig. 26a (see also Ref. [67]). The evolution

of those components can be qualitatively analyzed by means of ray–tracing, if we also rec-

ognize that the characteristic ﬁeld distribution of a Bessel beam arises in the volume where

the conical waves interfere. Typical examples, the free-space evolution and diﬀraction on

circularly symmetric mask, are depicted in Fig. 26a and Fig. 26b. As one can see, such well-

known features of Bessel beams as ﬁnite propagation length [57] and regeneration behind

an opaque screen appear immediately.

Let us place an axicon (or circular grating) onto plane z = 0 (see Fig. 26c). A qualitative

analysis by means of ray-tracing immediately reveals, that the element changes the cone

angle of both conical waves. The ”converging” conical wave forms a Bessel beam in a conical

near axis volume, but the cone angle is now diﬀerent. The ”diverging” conical component

leaves the near axis region. Hence, axicons and diﬀraction gratings change the cone angle

of a Bessel beam in the sense that the regenerated Bessel beam after the element is of a

diﬀerent cone angle.

Let us ﬁnd the cone angle of the resulting Bessel beam for a composite optical element–

a circular diﬀraction grating on the surface of an axicon (see Fig. 27a). We assume that a

Bessel–X pulse with cone angle θ0, generated by means of an annular slit and Fourier lens,

is incident upon it (see Fig. 27b). Snell’s law and the grating equation yield the following

equation for the cone angle of the resulting Bessel beam:

Thus, the method of stationary phase yields a similar result as the qualitative ray tracing

analysis – the output ﬁeld of an axicon (or circular grating), illuminated by a Bessel beam,

is a Bessel beam. If we assume a small angle limit i.e. sin x

generated cone angle θSP is also exactly the same as predicted by the ray tracing analysis

in Eq.(243) and we have shown that the Bessel beam generators can be used to change the

cone angle of Bessel beams. We also carried out experimental proof of this principle, the

typical results are depicted in Fig. 28.

The wavelength dispersion of the cone angle of the Bessel beam constituents of a FWM

θF (k) is determined by Eq. (35). Combining this condition with the dispersion of the cone

angle of the discussed setup θG (k) (243), we get

In following chapters we will see that the three free parameters (α, θ0, d) can be adjusted so

that the relation (252) is satisﬁed in a very good approximation in a limited spectral range.

As to ﬁnish this section we note that care must be taken when specifying the frequency
spectrum B (k) or ˜B (k) = k2 sin θ (k) in Eqs. (234), (236), (237) and (239). In terms of the

frequency spectrum of the light source s (k) – generally the choice the transform depends
on the particular setup under consideration. If we set s (k) = ˜B (k), we integrate over the

monochromatic Bessel beams with amplitudes s (k). However, for example in the principal

setup in Fig. 23 it is quite obvious that the amplitudes of the Bessel beams depend on

the diameter of the annular slit – the larger diameter means larger area of the slit and

more transmitted energy. Consequently, the ”chromatic” annular ring mask has a transfer

in place of (234) for the angular spectrum of plane waves (here υ (k) stands for the phase

distortions of the setup). As for the special cases of annular slit with constant diameter,

axicon and circular diﬀraction grating the analogous arguments show that the replacement

94

s (k) = ˜B (k) applies. (note also how the otherwise exponential frequency spectrum of the

FWM’s in Eq. (115) behaves as a Gaussian-like in (117) due to the k sin θF (k) term in the

expression of the Whittaker type plane wave expansion (17)). Of course, the generated wave

ﬁeld is propagation-invariant regardless of the weighting function in the superposition and

generally in any optical experiment only the bandwidth of the source have to be concerned

about.

C. Finite energy approximations to FWM’s

We already noted in the overview in Chapter IV that the total energy content of FWM’s

is inﬁnite and as such they are not realizable in any physical experiment. We also refer-

enced some of the most commonly used approaches to derive ﬁnite energy approximations

to FWM’s. Obviously, in experimental situation a natural choice is to consider the ap-

proximations that correspond to the speciﬁc launching mechanism.

In other words, the

approximations of the type (152) should be given a physical content, in terms of limitations

of a real experimental setup.

In what follows we derive the ﬁnite energy approximation

of FWM’s that is due to the ﬁnite aperture of the optical system introduced in previous

chapter (Ref. [54]).

In Fourier picture the starting point for this discussion is obvious. In this picture any

realistic (ﬁnite-aperture) optical system generates a superposition of apertured monochro-

matic Bessel beams so that the ﬁeld in the exit plane the FWM generator can be described

by (for brevity we restrict ourselves to cylindrically symmetric case)

ΨB (ρ, 0, 0; k) = t (ρ) J0 [kρ sin θF (k)] ,

(254)

where t (ρ) is the complex-amplitude transmission function of the aperture of the setup.

One just has to show that (i) the resulting superposition of the apertured Bessel beams

still represents a wave ﬁeld that propagate as a FWM, and (ii) the superposition has ﬁnite

energy content.

95

FIG. 29: On the ﬁnite aperture approximations to the Bessel beams. The optical setup is the

simple Bessel beam generator consisting of annular ring AS of diameter D, and the lens of aperture

D and focal length f . The striped region denotes the near axis volume where the generated wave

ﬁeld approximates closely the behaviour of the ﬁnite aperture Bessel beam.

1. Apertured (ﬁnite energy ﬂow approximations to) Bessel beams

The simplest mathematical model for the monochromatic Bessel beams is the exact so-

lution of the scalar homogeneous wave equation in Eq. (126)

ΨB (ρ, z, t) = J0 (kρ sin θ0) exp [ik (z cos θ0 −

ct)] .

(255)

In this case the beam can be described in Fourier’ picture by the single delta-ring in k-space

and the transformation of the beam in free space and in optical elements can be easily

estimated by simple geometrical constructions. However, such closed form Bessel beams

are not square integrable. The most apparent approach to deduce physically realizable

approximations to Bessel beams has been to apply a ﬁnite aperture to the system. The

problem has been discussed in many works, mostly in terms of Fresnel approximation of

scalar diﬀraction theory (see Refs. [70]–[97] and references therein).

As an alternative, we could use the Gaussian windowing proﬁle and consider the paraxial

wave equation – this combination yields a closed mathematical form of the beams, that have

been called the Bessel-Gauss beams (see Refs. [71, 75, 80, 88, 90] and references therein).

However, the paraxial approximation lacks the physical transparency of the angular spec-

trum representation. Still, it should be noted, that the Bessel-Gauss beams can be used to

construct wave ﬁelds that behave like LW’s propagating in free space.

We will use the generally accepted facts that (i) applying ﬁnite aperture to a Bessel beam

provides us with a ﬁnite energy ﬂow wave ﬁeld, that is a very good approximation of the

inﬁnite-aperture Bessel beams (254) in a certain ﬁnite-depth, near axis volume (see, e.g.,

Ref. [58]) and (ii) that the polychromatic superpositions of those apertured Bessel beams

approximate very closely the superpositions of ”non-apertured” Bessel beams in this volume

[67]. Such a behavior can be easily explained in the Fourier picture where a monochromatic

Bessel beam is a cylindrically symmetric superposition of plane waves, that propagate at

angle θ relative to z axis. Indeed, as the apertured plane waves approximate their inﬁnite

aperture counterparts very closely in their central parts, one can also observe a very good

approximation to the inﬁnite-aperture Bessel beam in this near-axis volume (see striped

region in Fig. 29 and Ref. [89] for a more detailed description in terms of diﬀraction theory).

If the cone angle of a Bessel beam is small, as it is always the case in paraxial optical

systems, the apertured Bessel beam would behave as its inﬁnite-aperture counterpart (254)

for several meters of propagation.

The situation in Fig. 29 can be modeled by applying the transmission function t (ρ) of the

aperture to the Bessel beams. In Weyl picture this operation is equivalent to calculating the

two-dimensional Fourier transform of the transversal amplitude distribution t (ρ) J0 (χ0ρ),

where χ0 stands for radial projection of the wave vector of the Bessel beam. Given the Weyl

type angular spectrum of plane waves of the inﬁnite-aperture Bessel beam

where K is a constant, the Fourier transform of (254) in point z = 0, t = 0 can be found to

The interpretation of the expression (258) is straightforward: the ﬁnite aperture gives the

support of angular spectrum of a monochromatic Bessel beam a ﬁnite ”width”. Exact form

of the support is determined by the complex-amplitude transmission function, however, the

well-known set of fundamental Fourier transform pairs gives a good idea of what the support

of angular spectrum looks like, without any calculations.

2. Apertured FWM’s

First of all, it has been demonstrated both numerically and experimentally that the super-

position of apertured Bessel beam behaves like the superposition of their inﬁnite-aperture

counterpart in near-axis volume as deﬁned in Fig. 29. Thus we can claim that the sub-

stitution of inﬁnite-aperture Bessel beams in (40) by their apertured counterparts should

generate a ﬁnite energy ﬂow wave ﬁeld that is a good approximation of the FWM (42) in

this ﬁnite volume. In other words, in this near-axis volume the apertured wave ﬁeld can be

well approximated by the formulas of inﬁnite-aperture wave ﬁelds.

Obviously, the ﬁnite aperture has a similar eﬀect on the angular spectrum support of a

FWM – the delta function in Eq. (40) is substituted by a weighting function and the angular

spectrum of plane waves of apertured FWM’s can be written as

where χF (k) = k sin θF (k). Consequently, the Weyl type plane wave expansion of the wave

ﬁeld behind the aperture reads

Alternatively, the transformation χ = k sin θ gives the expression (260) the following form

FIG. 30: The comparison of the supports of angular spectrums of plane waves of (a) an apertured

FWM and (b) of an EDEPT type superposition of FWM’s as described in above sections.

The support of the angular spectrum of plane waves (259) of the derived wave ﬁeld is

depicted on Fig. 30a. In correspondence with Eq. (258) it has a ﬁnite ”thickness”. We can

outline the main diﬀerence between the support of angular spectrum of LW’s, proposed in

this section (261) and that of EDEPT’s (152) discussed in section IV F 1. The comparison

of their supports of angular spectrum of plane waves on Fig. 30a and 30b (respectively)

shows, that the transversal ”width” in kxky plane of angular spectrum of plane waves of

our apertured FWM’s is a constant– such a result is a consequence of applying aperture

with a wavelength-independent complex-amplitude transmission function. On the other

hand, the transversal width is generally not constant for the superpositions of FWM’s in

Eq.(152). The description in this section gives the property a straightforward interpretation:

the corresponding aperture has a wavelength dependent complex-amplitude transmission

function. In the context of our discussion, where the main goal is optical feasibility, such an

approach should be regarded as an impractical one.

The spatial localization of the result (260) can be estimated by the approach in sec-

tion III A 5 – obviously the resulting wave ﬁeld still has the characteristic narrow central

peak. Also, in correspondence with the note in the beginning of current section, the ﬁeld

of apertured and non-apertured FWM’s do not diﬀer noticeably in the near-axis volume at

t = 0. Thus, if the aperture of the system is reasonably large (several millimeters) the only

qualitative eﬀect of the ﬁnite aperture is the reduced propagation length of the wave ﬁeld.

There is several ways to estimate the propagation length of the apertured FWM’s. The

simplest possibility is still use the geometrical construction in Fig. 29 from which we can

99

write

l1 (kmin) =

D
2 tan [θF (kmin)]

,

(262)

where kmin denotes the minimal wave vector of the spectrum of the wave ﬁeld (note, that

for the supports of FWM’s this generally corresponds to maximum angle max [θF (k)], i.e.,

to the minimal propagation length of the corresponding Bessel beams [clarify Fig. 29)]. The

second possibility is to estimate the propagation length of the apertured monochromatic

Bessel beams by means of the approach in the section III A 5 (in present case where the wave

ﬁeld is essentially monochromatic, this is actually the McCutchen theory as introduced in

Ref. [188]). From the Eq. (76) we at once get

l2 (kmin) = ∆z =

∆ρ
tan θF (kmin)

,

(263)

i.e., we get identical result as in Eq. (262). The third possibility is to estimate the maximum

group- and phase velocity uncertainty of the ﬁnite width support of the angular spectrum

of plane waves (257).

In conclusion, in our setup the ﬁnite energy (physically realizable) approximations to

FWM’s are introduced quite plainly by the ﬁnite aperture of the optical system. In Fourier

domain this corresponds to smoothing of the delta function in the angular spectrum of

plane waves of the wave ﬁelds. Also, the double integrals in Eq. (260) can in some detail be

handled without excessive numerical calculations.

3. On ﬁnite time window excitation of the FWM’s

In literature, there has been several works on generation of FWM’s where the ﬁnite total

energy has been achieved by limiting the excitation time of the source array [46, 47, 48, 49].

It has been shown, that, indeed, such approach do not destroy the localized propagation

of the generated pulses. It is intuitively clear, that the ﬁnite time excitation results in a

superposition of the longitudinal ”fragments” of the monochromatic Bessel beams. In this

picture the reasonable time window indeed do not corrupt the behaviour of the central part

of the wave ﬁeld, and it is still a good approximation that of the exact monochromatic

Bessel beam. What the time window do is that it broadens the frequency spectrum of the

points of the source matrix. Correspondingly, the support of the angular spectrum of the

generated wave ﬁeld would look much like the one in Fig. 30a. Actually, the excitation

100

time of our setup is also ﬁnite and the two broadening eﬀects – due the aperture and the

ﬁnite excitation time – appear simultaneously, however, the one that is caused by the ﬁnite

aperture is several orders of magnitude stronger.

D. Optical generation of partially coherent LW’s

The direct comparison of the equations describing the angular spectrum of plane waves

of coherent and partially coherent LW’s in Eqs. (33) – (45) and (192) – (195) respectively

implies, that the main part of the generating setup should be the same for both cases.

Indeed, the partially coherent quasi-monochromatic plane waves transform in linear optical

systems similarly as the coherent monochromatic plane waves, at least the description of the

previous chapter concerning refraction and diﬀraction in grating hold for both cases. The

qualitative diﬀerence lies in the correlations between the plane wave components.

1. The light source

According to our general idea of the optical generation of FWM’s in Sec. VI B, we need

a well-directed wideband partially coherent plane wave as the initial ﬁeld in our setup. In

mathematical limit the angular spectrum of plane waves of such initial ﬁeld is described by

a(φ, θ, k) = s(k)δ [θ] ,

giving for the ﬁeld

V (r, t) =

dk s(k) exp [ik (z

ct)] ,

where s (k) is generally stochastic function. Such ﬁeld is fully coherent in transversal direc-

tion. In longitudinal direction the coherence time τc is determined by the bandwidth of the

light ∆k and the reciprocity inequality [163]

For the ensemble average, we can write

In other words, the mutual coherence function of light ﬁeld behaves like a plane wave pulse

of the duration τs in coherent optics.

The traditional approach to generate such ﬁeld is to use a thermal light source, for exam-

ple the superhigh-pressure Xe-arc lamp, and spatially ﬁlter the light by means of a pinhole.

The well-known drawback of the choice is the hugely reduced signal level as compared to

laser sources. The alternative is to use a directional white-light continuum source.

2. FWM’s with frequency noncorrelation

As it was explained in section V B 2 (clarify Eqs. (209) and (210)), the FWM’s with

frequency noncorrelation diﬀer from their fully coherent counterparts only by the lack of

correlation between the ﬂuctuations of their Fourier components of diﬀerent frequency. Ob-

viously such ﬁelds can be generated by illuminating the setup in Fig. 27b with a wideband

partially coherent plane wave as described in Eqs. (264) – (268).

3. FWM’s with angular noncorrelation

According to section V B 3 the only diﬀerence between the fully coherent FWM’s and this

special case is the lack of correlation between the tilted pulses that compose the coherent

102

FWM’s. Thus, to generate a FWM with angular noncorrelation one has to illuminate

the setup by coherent light and somehow break the correlation between the tilted pulses

propagating at diﬀerent polar angles. This can be done by means of the modiﬁed setup

depicted in Fig. 31 (see Ref. [149] for the description of corresponding quasi-monochromatic

case). In this setup the pair of lenses L2, L3 is inserted into the path of FWM’s so that in the

focal plane of L2 the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the FWM’s – the characteristic

concentric rings – appear.

In this plane we can insert a weak diﬀuser as to modify the

amplitude and phase of the tilted pulses.

4. FWM’s with frequency and angular noncorrelation

In this special case one has to illuminate the setup in Fig 31 with the white-light source

as described in Eqs. (264) – (268).

E. Conclusions. Optical generation of general LW’s

As to conclude this chapter we note that except for the ultra-wide bandwidths, required

to generate the wave ﬁelds described in Chapter IV the concept of propagation-invariance

is well realizable in optical domain – we have shown, that the angular dispersion of various

Bessel beam generators can be used to transform the support of the angular spectrum of

plane waves so that to approximate that of the FWM’s in some limited near-axis volume.

The choice of the combination of the elements may be a problem in some cases, however,

the chances are good for ﬁnding satisfactory combination. Consequently, one can launch the

wave ﬁelds with the characteristic central peak that propagates over reasonable distances.

Note, that the LW’s containing plane waves that propagate at nonparaxial relative to z-

axis can in principle be generated within the framework of this approach. Nevertheless, this

requires very non-conventional optical elements like conical mirrors and diﬀraction gratings

as sketched in Fig. 32. Also, in this case the propagation distance of the generated LW’s is

quite short as can be seen from Eq. (262).

103

FIG. 32: Optical generation of LW’s that contain plane waves that subtend non-paraxial angles

with respect to the optical axis.

F. On the physical nature of propagation-invariance of pulsed wave ﬁelds

As to conclude the theoretical part of this review we interpret some of the properties of the

LW’s in the context of classical diﬀraction theory (see Ref. [113] for a relevant discussion).

The ﬁrst note has to be made on the deﬁnition of the propagation length of LW’s. Namely,

it has been claimed in several publications (see Ref. [40] for example) that the LW’s propagate

over extended distances as compared to that, deﬁned by the Rayleigh range ZR, the well

known estimate for the scale length of the falloﬀ in intensity behind of a Gaussian aperture

in the diﬀraction theory, deﬁned as (see Ref. [166] for example)

ZR =

πW 2
0
λ

,

(269)

W0 being the minimum spot size (radius) of the beam. Indeed, for the apertured FWM’s

the radial diameter of its central spot is approximately (75)

d

≈

4.81
k0 sin θF (k0)

= 1.5

10−4m

×

(again, γ = 1, β = 40 rad

m ) and if we consider a planar source with diameter D = 1cm, this

spot travels (262)

l1 (kmin) =

D
2 tan [θF (kmin)]

= 0.9m,

(270)

The Rayleigh range (269) of the Gaussian pulse with radius W0 = d is ZR ≈
≪
l1 (kmin). However, in our opinion such estimates are misleading and should not be used

8.8cm

without the following additional details.

104

FIG. 33: The comparison of the radial ﬁeld distribution of a FWM (left pane) with the ﬁeld that

is integrated over the polar angle (right pane).

The eﬀect of diﬀraction is typically manifested when an obstacle is placed in the path of a

light ﬁeld. For (pulsed) beams the deﬁnition (269) determines minimal spread corresponding

to the waist radius W0. In other words, this parameter determines the minimum radius of a

circular aperture that can be placed in the path of the beam without signiﬁcantly distorting

its behaviour behind the aperture. Now, as to compare the two estimates we have to ask,

what is the waist radius of an apertured FWM’s?

It appears, that the situation is similar to that with the monochromatic Bessel beams

for which the energy content in every transverse lobe is approximately constant and equal

to the energy content in the central maximum (see Ref. [113] for example). In the case of

apertured FWM’s the amplitude of the branches of the characteristic X-shape fall oﬀ ap-

proximately as 1/ρ. Thus, the integrated energy density as the function of radial coordinate

ρ is approximately constant, as the integration over the polar angle adds the factor ρ to

the amplitude of the wave ﬁeld (see Fig. 33). Thus, only a minor part of the energy of the

apertured FWM’s is contained in its central lobe and if one has to compare the propagation

length of the apertured FWM’s with the Rayleigh range of the Gaussian pulses, one should

take W0 = D instead of W0 = d in (269).

As the matter of fact, such comparison of the Gaussian pulse and apertured FWM’s is not

appropriate as focusing of the two wave ﬁelds are of qualitatively diﬀerent physical nature.

Namely, the Gaussian pulses are composed of monochromatic components with curved phase

105

FIG. 34: The comparison of the focusing of (a) FWM’s and (b) Gaussian pulses (see text).

fronts, the phase fronts of the monochromatic components of the FWM’s are conical. In

lights of this diﬀerence, one can say that the FWM’s are never focused in the conventional

sense of the term and the term, focus wave mode, is rather misleading.

In focusing Gaussian pulses most of its energy content can be concentrated into a single

spot for a time moment. A cunning mental picture of the energetic propertied of focusing

in FWM’s can be acquired if we suppose that we have an ideal (apertured) FWM generator

and suppose that we illuminate it with a plane wave pulse. Then central peak of each

monochromatic Bessel beam component of the generated FWM’s has the amplitude equal

to the amplitude of the corresponding monochromatic plane wave component of the initial

plane wave pulse. Indeed, the eﬀect of the FWM generator to this monochromatic plane

wave component is that its initial energy in the k-space (a ﬁnite width spot on the kz-axis)

is smeared over the ﬁnite width toroid in the k-space. In real space each point in this toroid

will compose an apertured plane wave in the Bessel beam and the net on-axis amplitude

of the Bessel beam is the integrated amplitude over the toroid in k-space, i.e., again the

amplitude of the initial monochromatic plane wave component. Now, for the superposition

of the Bessel beams we can say, that the only place where the constructive interference

occurs is the central spot of the apertured FWM. Thus, we can say, that given the initial

plane wave pulse with the amplitude A and aperture D, the amplitude of the central spot of

an apertured FWM behind an ideal FWM generator is that of the initial plane wave pulse

106

A, the rest of the energy is in the sidelobes of the generated FWM’s. This consequence is a

good illustration of the qualitative diﬀerence between the FWM’ and Gaussian pulse – due

to the curved phase fronts of its monochromatic components the latter can indeed eﬀectively

transfer most of its energy to a single spot for a time moment.

VII. THE EXPERIMENTS

In our experiments we realized the optical setups for two LW’s – the apertured Bessel-

X pulses and apertured FWM’s and used an interferometric cross-correlation method with

time-integrated intensity recording to study the generated wave ﬁelds. The material of this

chapter is published in Refs. I and V.

A. FWM’s in interferometric experiments

A straightforward method for recording the complicated ﬁeld shape of a coherent FWM

or Bessel-X pulses would use a CCD camera with a gate in front of it, which should possess a

temporal resolution and a variable ﬁring delay both in subfemtosecond range. As such a gate

is not realizable, any workable idea of experiment has to resort to a ﬁeld cross-correlation

technique (see Refs. [152]–[157] and references therein).

In our experiments the wave ﬁeld under investigation F (r, t) interfere with a reference

wave VP :

VΣ (r, t) = F (r, t) + VP (r, t) .

(271)

For the reference wave we can write

The above mathematical description yields identical results for the coherent and par-

tially coherent ﬁelds, i.e., the results of such experiments generally do not depend on the

correlations between the Fourier components of diﬀerent frequency of the wave ﬁelds – it is

well known that in any interferometric experiment the phase information of wave ﬁelds is

necessarily lost. In other words, the results of the experiments do not depend on whether

we use the transform-limited femtosecond pulses or a source of a stationary white noise.

The latter consequence is of great practical signiﬁcance. In our overview in Chapter IV

we used a spectrum that corresponds to a 3f s laser pulse and showed that the corresponding

FWM’s and Bessel-X pulse had a good spatial localization (see Fig. 13 and 17). However,

computer simulations, or even simple geometrical estimations show that if the autocorrela-

tion time of the source ﬁeld τ exceeds

10 femtoseconds, the characteristic X branching

∼

occurs too far from the axis z and in this narrow-band limit the resulting wave ﬁeld would

be nothing but a trivial interference of quasi-monochromatic plane waves. Thus, the band-

width of the light source is a very challenging part of the setup. In what follows we add to

the reputation of incoherent sources as being the poor mans femtosecond source and conﬁne

ourselves to the special case of frequency non-correlating ﬁelds.

B. Experiment on optical Bessel-X pulses

1. Setup

Our setup for the interferometric experiments on optical Bessel-X pulses is depicted in

Fig. 35b – as compared to the Bessel-X pulse generator in Fig. 25 the pinhole is made in

the centre of the annular ring mask as to form the reference ﬁeld (plane wave pulse) behind

the lens L. For the mathematical description of the situation we have to choose β = 0 in

parameters the dimensions of the plot xyz box are 20 times 20 times µm; (b) Optical scheme of

Eq. (281) zm denotes the distance along the optical axis of the setup. To understand the

signiﬁcance of this parameter we have to remember the superluminal group velocity of the

Bessel-X pulse – during the ﬂight the latter catch-up with the reference plane wave pulse.

In this context the coordinate zm is the distance of the recording device from this catch-up

point (see Fig. 35b).

If we deﬁne in the general expression for the mutual coherence function of the wave ﬁelds

in Eq. (216) the origin of the z axis as being in the point z = ct so that ∆z can be replaced

The interpretation of the small factor (1

axis microscope” for recording the mutual coherence function (281) along the z-axis which

scales the micrometer-range z dependence of the ﬁeld into a centimeter range.

we conclude that the experiment reveals the whole spatiotemporal structure of the Bessel-X

ﬁeld. The natural price we have to pay for resorting to the correlation measurements is

replacing the spectrum s (k) with its autocorrelation, which is a minor issue in the case

of transform-limited source pulses. Nevertheless, we cannot claim, that we actually detect

the ﬁeld under investigation (see also Ref. [52] for a relevant discussion).

Indeed, as the

absolute phases of the plane wave components are inevitably lost in any linear interferometric

experiments only the spatial amplitude distribution of the wave ﬁeld can be detected.

In the reasons described above we took advantage of the insensitivity of Eq. (281) to

the source ﬁeld phase and used a white light noise from a superhigh pressure Xe-arc lamp

instead of a laser as the ﬁeld source to achieve the

3 femtosecond correlation time in our

∼

experiment (V in Fig. 35b). Thus we implemented the third special case of Sec. V B – the

Bessel-X ﬁeld with frequency noncorrelation.

2. Results of the experiment

The recordings at 70 points on the z axis (from behind the L3 lens up to a point a

few centimeters beyond the origin) with a 0.5-cm step were performed with a cooled CCD-

camera EDC–1000TE, which has 2.64

2.64 mm working area containing 192

165 pixels,

and processed by a PC as follows.

First, the subtraction of the Bessel-X ﬁeld intensity was performed (see Fig. 36a), whereas

the same procedure with the plane wave ﬁeld intensity, due to its practically even distribu-

tion, was found to be unnecessary. In order to reduce noise and the dimensionality of the

data array, an averaging over the polar angle in every recording was carried out by taking

advantage of the axial symmetry of the ﬁeld. Thus we got a 1D array containing up to

hundred signiﬁcant elements from every 192

165 matrix recorded. Seventy such arrays

×
formed a matrix, which, having in mind the known symmetry of the real part of Eq. (281),

was mirrored in the lateral and the axial plane. The result is compared in Fig. 36b with

the Bessel-X ﬁeld distribution in an axial plane, computed from Eq. (286) for a model

spectrum. The latter was taken as a convex curve covering the whole visible region from

blue to near infrared (up to 0.9 µm) in order to simulate the eﬀective light spectrum in

the experiment, which is a product of the Xe-arc spectrum and the sensitivity curve of the

camera. The central (carrier) frequency was chosen corresponding to wavelength 0.6 µm

which had been determined from the fringe spacing of an autocorrelation pattern recorded

for the light source with the same CCD camera. The left- and right-hand tails of the central

X-like structure are more conspicuous in the experimental pattern due to unevenness of the

real Xe-arc spectrum. The diﬀerent scaling of the horizontal axes of the two panels is in

accordance with the z axis ”magniﬁcation” factor of the experimental setup.

Observing the obvious agreement between theoretical and experimental patterns, we ar-

rive at a conclusion that we have really recorded the characteristic spatiotemporal proﬁle of

an optical realization of the nonspreading axisymmetric Bessel-X ﬁeld.

C. Experiment on optical FWM’s

1.

3D FWM’s and 2D FWM’s, the mathematical description of the experiment

To prove the feasibility of the approach for optical generation of apertured FWM’s de-

scribed in Chapter VI one has to implement the setup depicted in Fig. 27b and show that

the generated wave ﬁeld indeed behaves as a FWM in interferometric experiments. However,

without the loss of generality the task can be simpliﬁed as follows.

In section III C 1 we demonstrated that all the deﬁning properties of the FWM’s – its

propagation-invariance, the characteristic ﬁeld distribution and pre-determined group veloc-

ity – can be studied in terms of the speciﬁc pair of interfering tilted pulses, the 2D FWM’s

in Eq. (89):

F2D (x, y, z, t) =

dk ˜B (k)

0
Z

cos [kx sin θF (k)] exp [ik (z cos θF (k)

(287)

×

−

(here we have set φ = 0). In other words, we have shown that the peculiar propagation of

FWM’s is assured exclusively by the speciﬁc coupling between the wave number and the

direction of propagation of plane wave components of the FWM’s as deﬁned by the function

θF (k) in Eq. (34).

In [56] we experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of 2D FWM’s in Eq. (287) as the

physical concept which is much more transparent in this sort of experiments. However, it

also appeared, that the fabrication and polishing of a high-quality, large aperture concave

conical surfaces is still a complicated task.

The mutual coherence function for the 2D FWM’s can be easily deduced from the one

for the (3D) FWM’s (216). In complete analogy with the discussion in section III C 1 we

114

replace the Bessel function J0 () by cos (), choose appropriate coordinates and get

of the three-dimensional one.

and we can conclude that the mutual coherence function of the 2D FWM’s can be studied

by recording the intensity of the interference picture as the function of the delay ∆t between

the signal and reference ﬁelds.

where t0 = z/c and the constant has the interpretation of being the time that a wave ﬁeld

propagating at group velocity c travels the distance z to the plane of measurement. The

integral expression (295) is very similar to the one describing the ﬁeld of the 2D FWM’s

(287), the only diﬀerence being that the theoretical angular function θF (k) is replaced

by the θG (k) and frequency spectrum is replaced by the power spectrum

(k) in (295).

S

Again, as the absolute phases of the plane wave components are inevitably lost in any

linear interferometric experiments we can detect only the amplitude distribution of the wave

ﬁeld. However, the interferograms do carry information about the deﬁning, most essential

characteristic of the FWM’s – their support of the angular spectrum of plane waves. Indeed,

the general structure of the interference patterns in Eq. (295) is primarily determined by

the angular function θG (k), and it resembles the corresponding transform-limited wave ﬁeld

only if θG (k) = θF (k) in good approximation over the entire bandwidth of the ﬁeld.

2. Setup

The conversion of the FWM generator in Fig. 27b to the two-dimensional case is straight-

forward – we just replace the axicon and circular diﬀraction by their one-dimensional coun-

terparts – prisms (wedges) and a diﬀraction grating. The initial ﬁeld on the elements is an

interfering pair of pulsed plane waves.

The setup of our experiment is depicted in Fig. 37. The main part of it is the (2D) FWM

generator that consist of the mirrors M7 and M8, of the two wedges W1 and W2 and of a

blazed diﬀraction grating G.(see grayed area in Fig. 37). The FWM generator is placed into

an arm of an interferometer as will be explained below.

In our experiment we implemented a 2D FWM with following parameters: β = 40rad/m,

γ = 1 (vg = c) giving θF (k0)

0.23◦ if k0 = 7.8

≈

106rad/m (λ0 ≈

×

800nm) (see Fig. 38a for

the spectral density of the light source and Fig. 38b for the support of the angular spectrum

of plane waves of the speciﬁed 2D FWM).

The FWM generator has three free parameters: α – the apex angle of the wedges, θ0 –

< 0.2%. A comparison of the corresponding supports of angular spectrum and the exact

form of deviation δθ (k) are depicted in Figs. 38b and 38c (see also Fig. 24). As for rough

estimation of the spread of the pulse due to the δθ (k) one can estimate the corresponding

maximum group velocity dispersion ∆vg and compare this with the mean wavelength of the

pulse. The numerical simulations show that the approximation is indeed good enough for

propagating the central peak of the FWM’s over several meters.

The FWM generator has been placed in what is basically a specially designed, modi-

ﬁed Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interferometer consists of two beamsplitters and of

identical broadband non-dispersive mirrors. The input ﬁeld from the light source is split by

the beamsplitter BS1 into the ﬁelds that travel through the two arms of the interferometer,

the one with the FWM generator and the arm for the reference beam. The mirrors M5

and M6 form a delay line, they were translated by the Burleigh Inchworm linear step mo-

tor, the 1µm translation step of which was reduced to 65nm by a transmission mechanism.

The mirror M7 was continuously translatable as to correct for the time-shift between the

two tilted pulses. The wedges W1 and W2 were transversally translatable as to balance

the material dispersion they introduce to the plane wave pulses (see text below). We used

Kodak Megaplus 1.6i CCD camera with the 1534

depth. The linear dimensions of the matrix are 13.8mm(H)

9.2mm(V), the pixel size is

Again, in our experiment we used the ﬁltered light form a superhigh pressure Xe-arc lamp,

giving

5 f sec correlation time for the input ﬁeld [see Fig. 38a for the power spectrum of

the light]. To ensure good transversal coherence over the clear aperture of the setup the

required maximum diameter

Fourier lens L1 was estimated from the van Cittert-Zernike theorem [163] for the mean

wavelength of the light λ0 = 800nm. As the result of ﬁltering, the total power of the signal

119

on the

1.5cm2 CCD chip was very low, approximately 0.03µW .

≈

Due to the short coherence time of the source ﬁeld, the experiment is highly sensitive to

the phase distortions (spectral phase shift) introduced by the dispersive optical elements of

the system – the beamsplitters and the FWM generator. In the FWM generator there is

three possible sources of undesirable dispersion: (1) the propagation in the glass substrate

of the diﬀraction grating, (2) the propagation between the grating and the axicon where

the support of angular spectrum of the wave ﬁeld is not appropriate for the free space

propagation, i.e., it does not obey the Eq. (34) and (3) the propagation in the wedges. The

beamsplitters in our setup are identical and if we set them perpendicularly and orient the

coated sides so that each beam passes the glass substrate of the beamsplitter twice, the

arms of the interferometer remain balanced. The inﬂuence of the propagation between the

elements can be made neglible by placing them close to each other. The character of the

undesirable dispersion in the wedges can be estimated from the following considerations. The

entrance wave ﬁeld on the wedges is the transform-limited Bessel-X pulse, so, the on-axis part

of the pulse is also transform-limited and should pass through the wedges unchanged, i.e.,

without any additional spectral phase shift. Consequently, the wedges should be produced

and aligned so that their thickness is zero on the optical axis. As the apex angle of the wedges
0.7◦), this is not very practical approach and we consider the

is very small in our setup (

≈

ﬁnite thickness on the axis as the source of additional spectral phase shift instead. Thus,

the composite spectral phase shift of the FWM generator can be described as the phase

distortion introduced by the substrate of the diﬀraction grating and by a glass plate of the

material of the wedges, the thickness of which is equal to the thickness of the wedges on the

optical axis. We balanced the arms of the interferometer by inserting material dispersion

into the reference arm of the setup by means of two appropriate glass plates (GP1 and GP2

in Fig. 37a).

3. Results of the experiment

In ﬁrst experiment we recorded the time-averaged interference pattern of the 2D FWM

and the reference wave ﬁeld as the function of the time delay between the two. The exper-

iment can be mathematically modeled by varying parameter ∆t in Eq. (292). We scanned

the time-delay at three z-axis positions, z = 0cm, z = 25cm, z = 50cm (the origin of the

120

FIG. 39: (a) A typical interferogram in the setup as recorded by the CCD camera; (b) The

interference pattern in the setup as the function of the delay between the signal and reference wave

ﬁelds in three positions of the CCD camera (see text for more detailed description).

z-axis is about 30cm away from the beamsplitter BS2 in Fig. 37a). In each experiment we

recorded 300 interferograms, the time-delay step was 0.43 f sec (0.13 µm).

In a typical interference pattern in our experiment [see Fig. 39a] the sharp vertical inter-

ference fringes in the center correspond to the second term in the interference sum (289) –

this is the time-averaged, ”propagation-invariant” time-averaged intensity of the 2D FWM.

The fringes can also be interpreted as the autocorrelation function of the interfering tilted

pulses [see Fig. 38a for the corresponding power spectrum]. In this experiment the intensity

of the wave ﬁeld under study do not carry any important information, so we subtracted it nu-

merically from the results in Fig. 39b. The interference fringes that are symmetrical at both

121

sides of the central part correspond to the third, most important term in this sum. It can

be seen from Fig. 39a, that due to the low signal level the recorded interferograms are quite

noisy. To get the better signal-to-noise ratio, we averaged the data in the interferograms

over the rows and used the resulting one-dimensional data arrays instead.

The results of the experiment are depicted in Fig. 39b. We can see, that there is a good

qualitative resemblance between the measured x∆t plot of the interference pattern and the

theoretical ﬁeld distribution of the 2D FWM’s in Fig. 7b as it was predicted by the Eq. (295)

– one can clearly recognize the two interfering tilted pulses forming the characteristic X-

branching, also the phase fronts in the tilted pulses can be seen. The wave ﬁeld is deﬁnitely

transform-limited, so we have managed to compensate for the spectral phase shift in the 2D

FWM generator.

We can also see, that the interference pattern does not show any spread over the 0.5 m

distance, consequently, the wave ﬁeld does not spread in the course of propagation.

An additional detail can be found in Fig. 39b: the tilted pulses do not extend across

the whole picture but are cut out (see dashed lines in Fig. 39b). Also, the ”edges” of the

tilted pulses move away from the optical axis. This eﬀect can be clearly interpreted as the

consequence of the ﬁnite extent of the tilted pulses, as illustrated in Figs. 24a and 26 – the

dashed lines simply mark the borders of the volume, where the two tilted pulses intersect,

i.e., the borders of the volume, where the 2D FWM exist [see the striped area in Fig. 24a].

In the second experiment we recorded the interference pattern as the function of the prop-

agation distance z. The experiment can be simulated by varying z coordinate in Eq. (292).

We recorded 240 interferograms, the step of the CCD camera position was 3.1 mm. The

numerical simulation of the experiment and the results of the experiment are depicted in

Figs. 40b and 40c respectively.

The experiment can be easily interpreted – the position-invariant envelope of the inter-

ference pattern is the consequence of the fact, that the group velocities of the propagation-

invariant 2D FWM and the reference ﬁeld are equal, c, so that the overlapping volume of

the two ﬁelds do not change in the course of propagation (see Fig. 40a). The z dependent

ﬁner structure of the interferograms is the consequence of the fact, that the phase velocities

of the plane wave pulse and 2D FWM are not equal, i.e., we have also vg

= vp for the phase

and group velocities of the 2D FWM. The result of the experiment in Fig. 40c show good

qualitative agreement with the theory.

122

FIG. 40: The interference pattern as the function of the CCD camera position (see text for detailed

description).

We can also determine the parameter β from our experiment – the exponent multiplier

in Eq. (292) reads exp [i2βz], thus β = π/z0 where z0 is the period of the variations along
the z-axis. From the result in Fig. 40a we estimated z0 ≈
which result is in good agreement with the theory.

Thus, we have shown, that the generated wave ﬁeld has all the characteristic properties

VIII. SELF-IMAGING OF PULSED WAVE

FIELDS

Self-imaging, also known as Talbot eﬀect is, in its original sense, a well-known phe-

nomenon in classical wave optics where certain wave ﬁelds reproduce their transversal in-

tensity distribution at periodic spatial intervals in the course of propagation (see Refs. [168]

– [177], and references therein). The eﬀect has been studied extensively by means of Fresnel

diﬀraction theory and the angular spectrum representation of scalar wave ﬁelds. As a result,

the general, physically transparent conditions have been formulated the transversal intensity

distribution of a wave ﬁeld have to obey to be self-imaging. It is also well known that the

monochromatic propagation-invariant wave ﬁelds (Bessel beams) constitute a special class

of self-imaging wave ﬁelds, the mathematical description of the two being much the same.

In recent years the eﬀect has attracted a renewed interest, as the concept has been

generalized into the domain of pulsed wave ﬁelds by several authors (see Refs.

[172, 175,

176, 180, 181], and references therein). The phenomenon has been discussed in the context of

ﬁber optics [172] and also as a property of spatial, wideband wave ﬁelds [175, 176, 180, 181].

In what follows we show, that the discrete superpositions of FWM’s over the parameter

β

Ψ(SI) (ρ, z, ϕ, t) =

CqΨF (z, ρ, ϕ, t; βq)

can be used as the self-imaging “pixels” of a spatiotemporally self-imaging three-dimensional

spatial image – the wave ﬁelds of this type can reproduce spatial separated copies of its initial

three-dimensional intensity distribution at speciﬁc time intervals. The results in this chapter

(It is important to note, that our discussion is closely related to those in Refs.

[[175]]

and [181] – those publications consider essentially the same problem, however the analysis

are published in Ref. [55].

is diﬀerent in each occasion)

124

A. Monochromatic self-imaging

The self-imaging condition for the monochromatic wave ﬁeld has been deﬁned as (see,

e.g., Ref. [169])

Ψ (ρ, z, ϕ, t) = Ψ (ρ, z + d, ϕ, t) .

(300)

With the condition (300) and the Whittaker type angular spectrum of plane waves of

monochromatic wave ﬁelds (see Eq. (17)

one can easily deduce the condition for self-imaging for the monochromatic scalar wave ﬁelds

that reads [169]

kd cos θ = ψ + 2πq,

where q is an integer and ψ is an arbitrary phase factor. The relation (302) implies, that a

monochromatic wave ﬁeld (15) periodically reconstructs its initial transversal ﬁeld distribu-

tion if only its angular spectrum of plane waves is sampled so that the condition

kz =

ψ + 2πq

,

where kz is again the z component of the wave vector, is satisﬁed for every plane wave

component of the wave ﬁeld. Applying the condition (303) and including only the axially

symmetric terms in the summation, we get the following expression for the general cylindri-

cally symmetric, monochromatic, self-imaging wave ﬁeld:

angles are speciﬁed by Eq. (303). The physical content of Eqs. (303) and (304) can be

summarized by saying that the monochromatic self-imaging is essentially the phenomenon

where the wave ﬁeld is a discrete superposition of wave ﬁelds with diﬀerent phase velocities

125

so that the total ﬁeld, being the superposition of the composite ﬁelds, depends periodically

on the distance.

B. Self-imaging of pulsed wave ﬁelds

From the material in Chapter III we know that the phase velocities vp of the FWM’s

with diﬀerent parameter β along the optical axis are generally diﬀerent and we can write

vp (β) =

Thus, the superposition of FWM’s over the parameter β in (299)

is taken over a set of overlapping, non-spreading optical pulses that (1) are transversally

localized, i.e., their transversal intensity distribution have a single narrow intense peak, (2)

have equal carrier frequency, (3) propagate at equal group velocities, but (4) have diﬀerent

phase velocities. In complete analogy with the monochromatic self-imaging we could suggest

that if the component pulses satisfy certain conditions, the single narrow peak of the wave

ﬁeld could periodically vanish and reconstruct its initial (localized) transversal intensity

distribution. As a result we could get a wave ﬁeld the temporal evolution of which can be

perceived as a spatial arrow of sequentially visible light spots (see Fig. 41). In this sense,

such superposition could be considered self-imaging and, due to its spatial localization, it

could be used as a pulsed “self-imaging pixel” of a transversal or even spatial image.

The Eq. (315) is essentially a product of a propagating pulse L(x, zγ

ct) and of a term, that

is a mathematical equivalent of the superposition of the monochromatic carrier-wavelength

plane waves that propagate at angles θF (k0, βq) to the optical axis. According to our general

idea, the latter term should be self-imaging in the conventional, monochromatic sense of the

term in Eq. (304) – in this case the product (315) behaves as a pulse that vanishes and

reconstructs itself periodically.

In complete analogy with the Eq. (302) the condition for such behavior can be written as

k = d cos θF (k0, βq) = ψ + 2πq.

and with the Eq. (33) we can write

2πq

(see Fig. 42 for an example). The direction of propagation of the carrier wavelength plane

wave component of the tilted pulse (310) can be found by combining the Eqs. (33) and (318):

and this is the discrete superposition of FWM’s we were looking for in Eq. (309).

The on-axis longitudinal shape of the superposition in Eq. (323) can be easily evaluated for

the most practical case of a uniform superposition of (2n + 1) tilted pulses, centered around

some carrier spatial frequency kz (k0, βQ) (see Fig. 43). Superposition can be expressed as

As the second example we demonstrate the self-imaging transmission of a non-trivial

spatial image, depicted on Fig. 44a. The image consists of eight “pixels”– the self-imaging

superpositions of FWM’s – speciﬁed in previous example. The numerical examples clearly

show that the concept, in principle, is applicable for constructing wave ﬁelds that self-image

three-dimensional images. Still, the experimental realization of such wave ﬁelds is not trivial.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

In this review we developed a physically transparent, comprehensive theory for the de-

scription of propagation-invariance of the scalar wideband wave ﬁelds in terms of Whittaker

type angular spectrum of plane waves. This representation was demonstrated to be very

useful in discussions on the physical nature of the localized wave transmission phenomenon

and propose a general idea for optical generation of the localized waves.

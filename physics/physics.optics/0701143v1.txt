Comparison of spin eﬀects and self forces on the

Abstract

The relativistic equation of motion of a particle with spin is derived. The

eﬀects of the spin are compared to the eﬀects of the self force. For low
energies the spin eﬀects are shown to be two orders of magnitude larger than
the self force. For higher energies is is shown that the self forces are bigger,
and the overall magnitude of the eﬀects are compared.

1 Introduction

With reports of laser intensities of 1022 W cm−2, and expectations of an increase by

at least an order of magnitude,[1] the classical equation of motion of electrons in

electromagnetic ﬁelds is gaining renewed interest. When considering the motion of

electrons in such extreme ﬁelds, these particles quickly become free and attain

energies that vastly exceed their rest energies. The correspondence principle, with

such extremely high principle quantum numbers, clearly indicates the validity of the

classical approximation, where not only radiation reaction eﬀects become

important,[2] but the eﬀect of the interaction of the intrinsic magnetic moment of

the particle and the external electromagnetic ﬁeld becomes large.[3]

An unsolved problem relates to the comparison of the intrinsic spin eﬀects to

the self self forces. Speciﬁcally, we need to understand at what energies spin eﬀects

dominate and if, and when, self forces predominate. A simple calculation in the low

∗rhammond@email.unc.edu

velocity limit indicates that the spin eﬀects are important. Let us consider the ratio,

Ro, self force to the spin force in the low velocity limit,

2e2 ˙a/3
∇(µ
and use ˙a = e ˙E/m, where the dot indicates the time derivative, e is the charge, a is

the acceleration, µ is the magnetic dipole moment, and c = 1. For an

electromagnetic wave of the form E cos(kx

ωt) this yields

−

Ro = α

(2)

where α is the ﬁne structure constant. This result shows that the spin force is two

orders of magnitude larger than the radiation reaction force. Of course this result

holds in the low velocity limit, and indicates that the spin force should be examined

more carefully. If one naively (and incorrectly) replaces da/dt by da/dτ in the above,
than the quotient in (2) is multiplied by v0, which becomes large for high energies.

This indicates that at high energies the self forces may become larger than the spin

forces, and a more careful analysis in the following will show that this is the case.

The point, and an objective of this paper, is to ﬁnd the relativistic

generalization of this result. This will be achieved by ﬁrst developing the classical

equation of motion with spin, ignoring radiation reaction eﬀects. Then the equation

of motion with self forces will be examined, ignoring spin, and the results will be

compared. In this approximation we ignore the radiation reaction eﬀects of the spin

part, which is a small part of a small part.

An early detailed work on this subject is given by Bjabha and Corben.[4]

This subject was also treated in the book of Barut,[5] who returned to the problem

of radiation reaction years later.[6] In the 1960s, a classical equation of motion with

a spin interaction was derived by starting with the quantum mechanical equation,

and obtaining the classical limit by disregarding the commutators.[7] A year later,

following an attempt by Pauli, an asymptotic solution to the Dirac equation was

developed using the WKB method for a particle with an anomalous moment,[8] and

an anomalous moment was used to explore classical electrodynamics resulting from

a nonlinear Dirac equation.[9] A comprehensive review of particle-laser interaction

in high intensities has been published recently.[10]

This article derives the equation of motion from an action principle, but also

derives the ﬁeld equations that follow from the same action. The generalized BMT

equation is also derived. A few deﬁnitions will help clarify the discussion below.
The spin tensor is deﬁned in terms of the spin vector Sα according to

where ǫµναβ is the totally antisymmetric tensor. Equivalently

We know that the force on a magnetic dipole in a magnetic ﬁeld is given by

f = ∇ (µ

·

This well known result is derived by integrating the Biot-Savart law around a small

current loop and deﬁning the magnetic moment as a line integral in the usual way.

It is not a valid deﬁnition for an elementary particle, since we know that the

magnetic moment cannot be explained by a small loop current. Therefore we

introduce the interaction directly into the action. The relativistic generalization of

which implies the generalization of (7) is f µ = (e/2m)(FµνSµν),µ and therefore the
naive relativistic generalization of (6) is dpµ/dτ = eF µσvσ + f µ. This is incorrect

because it fails to obey the condition that the velocity is orthogonal to the

equation of motion are generally small but, for an electron mass, become

appreciable for hard x-rays and important for gamma rays, and may even be

dominate for high energy gamma rays such as observed by EGRET.

4 Radiation Reaction

As mentioned in the introduction, intensities of 1022 W cm−2 have been reached,

and this number is expected to go even higher. At such extreme conditions, the

radiation reaction force is expected to become important, and we will examine the

intensities where the onset of the self force becomes important before comparisons

with the spin is made.

It is helpful to begin with the relativistic equation of motion, (6), and

consider an electromagnetic wave of the form

bad times due to the the runaway solutions, pre-acceleration issues, or the apparent

need to invoke non-zero size particles.[11] For a nice introduction to the issues, with

historical notes, one may consult Rohrlich[13], which has many of the seminal

references and discusses the distinction between “self forces” and “radiation reaction

forces.” More recent work considers the problem in various dimensions,[14][15] the

eﬀect of the magnetic dipole,[16][17], connections to QED[18] and vacuum

polarization,[20], mass conversion[19], and hydrogenic orbits.[21]

The Landau Lifschitz Rohrlich equation is obtained by starting with (32) but

using

These solutions correspond to somewhat speciﬁc incident ﬁelds, but the main

purpose is to examine the relative weight of the eﬀects of radiation reaction spin

forces. Comparing (52) to (47) explicitly veriﬁes the result (36).

In summary, the classical equations of motion for a particle with an intrinsic

magnetic moment in an electromagnetic ﬁeld have been derived. They were derived

from an action principle in Minkowski spacetime along with the ﬁeld equations. The

generalized BMT equation was given, and the non-dimensionalized form of the

coupled equations was given, a simple approximate solution was exhibited. The

eﬀects of the spin force and the self force were considered for high intensity

radiation, and conditions where the radiation forces become larger than spin eﬀects

were examined.

The results derived here are not readily amenable to be tested in current

laboratory experiments, but they tell us when spin is important, the onset of

radiation reaction, and the energies and wavelengths for which self forces begin to

dominate over spin. These results will be used to guide future work that will

calculate observable characteristics, such as radiation emission spectra, of

ultrarelativistic particle motion. Another interesting area with this formalism can

be applied is the motion of neutral particles with spin in strong magnetic ﬁelds,

such as the behavior of neutrons near magnetars.

6 Appendix

The action has been generalized to describe the interaction of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld with a point dipole, but we should bear in mind that the ﬁeld equations also

follow from the action. In this case we hold the trajectory ﬁxed while considering
variation in Aµ. This gives,

Thus, the equations of electrodynamics have been altered by the additional
source iν, and it is important to consider the ramiﬁcations of any modiﬁcation to

such a successful theory as electrodynamics. First, it is easy to see that since
0, (jµ + iµ),µ = 0. The deﬁnitions (54) and (55) show that the four

divergence of each of these vanish. This we have the usual conservation of charge.

To see the eﬀect of the new source term, consider the nonrelativistic limit,

and consider the source deﬁned over some small region of space. A mulitpole

expansion of the vector potential is

electron has a magnetic dipole moment which gives rise to a magnetic dipole ﬁeld.

This ﬁeld can be measured classically, e. g., be detecting the magnetic ﬁeld of any

substance in which the ﬁeld arises solely from the intrinsic moment (and not from

the orbital angular momentum). As is well known, it is impossible to account for
this observed ﬁeld from jµ alone: Any charge distribution conﬁned to particle sizes

would have to involve linear speeds far in excess of the speed of light. However, (57)
shows that the new source term gives precisely what is observed.4

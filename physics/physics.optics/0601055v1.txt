Second harmonic generation and optical parametric ampliﬁcation in negative-index metamaterials
(NIMs) are studied. The opposite directions of the wave vector and the Poynting vector in NIMs
results in a ”backward” phase-matching condition, causing signiﬁcant changes in the Manley-Rowe
relations and spatial distributions of the coupled ﬁeld intensities.
It is shown that absorption
in NIMs can be compensated by backward optical parametric ampliﬁcation. The possibility of
distributed-feedback parametric oscillation with no cavity has been demonstrated. The feasibility of
the generation of entangled pairs of left- and right-handed counter-propagating photons is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Recent demonstration of a negative refractive index
for metamaterials in the optical range [1, 2] opens new
avenues for optics and especially nonlinear optics. In par-
allel with progress for metal-dielectric metamaterials, ex-
perimental demonstrations of negative refraction in the
near IR range have been made in a GaAs-based pho-
tonic crystals [3] and in Si-Polyimide photonic crystals
[4]. Negative refractive-index metamaterials (NIMs) are
also referred to as left-handed materials (LHMs). The
suﬃcient (but not necessary) condition for a negative re-
fractive index is simultaneously negative dielectric per-
mittivity ǫ(ω) and negative magnetic permeability µ(ω)
[5]. Negative magnetic permeability in the optical range
has been demonstrated in [6, 7, 8]. NIMs exhibit highly
unusual optical properties and promise a great variety
of unprecedented applications. Optical magnetization,
which is normally ignored in linear and nonlinear-optics
of the ordinary, positive-index materials (PIMs) (i.e.,
right-handed materials, RHMs) plays a crucial role in
NIMs.

The main emphasis in the studies of NIMs has been
placed so far on linear optical eﬀects. Recently it has
been shown that NIMs including structural elements with
non-symmetric current-voltage characteristics can pos-
sess a nonlinear magnetic response at optical frequencies
[9] and thus combine unprecedented linear and nonlinear
electromagnetic properties. Important properties of sec-
ond harmonic generation (SHG) in NIMs in the constant-
pump approximation were discussed in [10] for semi-
inﬁnite materials and in [11] for a slab of a ﬁnite thick-

ness. The propagation of microwave radiation in non-
linear transmission lines, which are the one-dimensional
analog of NIMs, was investigated in [12]. The possi-
bility of exact phase-matching for waves with counter-
propagating energy-ﬂows has been shown in [13] for the
case when the fundamental wave falls in the negative-
index frequency domain and the SH wave lies in the
positive-index domain. The possibility of the existence of
multistable nonlinear eﬀects in SHG was also predicted
in [13].

As seen from our consideration below, the phase-
matching of normal and backward waves is inherent for
nonlinear optics of NIMs. We note here that the impor-
tant advantages of interaction schemes involving counter-
directed Poynting vectors in the process of optical para-
metric ampliﬁcation in ordinary RHMs were discussed in
early papers [14]. However, in RHMs such schemes im-
pose severe limitations on the frequencies of the coupled
waves because of the requirement that one of the waves
has to be in the far-infrared range.

Absorption is one of the biggest problems to be ad-
dressed for the practical applications of NIMs. In [10, 11],
a transfer of the near-ﬁeld image into SH frequency do-
main, where absorption is typically much less, was pro-
posed as a means to overcome dissipative losses and thus
enable the superlens.

In this paper, we demonstrate unusual characteristics
in the spatial distribution of the energy exchange between
the fundamental and second-harmonic waves. Both semi-
inﬁnite and ﬁnite-length NIMs are considered and com-
pared with each other and with ordinary PIMs. Our anal-
ysis is based on the solution to equations for the coupled
waves propagating in lossless NIMs beyond the constant-
pump approximation. The Manley-Rowe relations for
NIMs are analyzed and they are shown to be strikingly
diﬀerent from those in PIMs. We also propose a new
means of compensating losses in NIMs by employing opti-
cal parametric ampliﬁcation (OPA). This can be realized
by using control electromagnetic waves (with frequencies

B. SHG: Basic equations and the Manley-Rowe
relations

We assume that an incident ﬂow of fundamental ra-
diation S1 at ω1 propagates along the z-axis, which is
normal to the surface of a metamaterial. According to
(5), the phase of the wave at ω1 travels in the reverse
direction inside the NIM (the upper part of Fig.1). Be-
cause of the phase-matching requirement, the generated
SH radiation also travels backward with energy ﬂow in
the same backward direction. This is in contrast with the
standard coupling geometry in a PIM (the lower part of
Fig.1). Following the method of [13], we assume that a

outside the negative-index domain), which provide the
loss-balancing OPA inside the negative-index frequency
domain. We also predict laser oscillations without a cav-
ity for frequencies in the negative-index domain and the
possibility of the generation of entangled pairs of counter-
propagating right- and left-handed photons.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses
the unusual spatial distribution of the ﬁeld intensities
for SHG in ﬁnite and semi-inﬁnite slabs of NIMs. The
Manley-Rowe relations are derived and discussed here.
The feasibility of compensating losses in NIMs by using
the OPA is considered in Section III. In this Section we
also study cavity-less oscillations based on distributed
feedback. Finally, a summary of the obtained results
concludes the paper.

II. SECOND HARMONIC GENERATION IN
NIMS

A. Wave vectors and Poynting vectors in NIMs

We consider a loss-free material, which is left-handed
at the fundamental frequency ω1 (ǫ1 < 0, µ1 < 0),
whereas it is right-handed at the SH frequency ω2 = 2ω1
(ǫ2 > 0, µ2 > 0). The relations between the vectors of
the electrical, E, and magnetic, H, ﬁeld components and
the wave-vector k for a traveling electromagnetic wave,

E(r, t) = E0(r) exp[

which follow from Maxwell’s equations. These expres-
sions show that the vector triplet E, H and k forms a
right-handed system for the SH wave and a left-handed
system for the fundamental beam. Simultaneously neg-
ative ǫi < 0 and µi < 0 result in a negative refractive
index n =
√µǫ. As seen from Eqs. (1) and (2), the
phase velocity vph is co-directed with k and is given by
vph = (k/k)(ω/k) = (k/k)(c/
), where k2 = n2(ω/c)2.

where, ω2 = 2ω1 and k1,2 > 0 are the moduli of the wave-
vectors directed against the z-axis. We note that accord-
ing to Eq. (4) the corresponding equations for the electric
components can be written in a similar form, with ǫj sub-
stituted by µj and vice versa. The factors µj were usually
assumed to be equal to one in similar equations for PIMs.
However, this assumption does not hold for the case of
NIMs, and this fact dramatically changes many conven-
tional electromagnetic relations. The Manley-Rowe rela-
tions [15] for the ﬁeld intensities and for the energy ﬂows
follow from Eqs. (5) - (7):

The latter equation accounts for the diﬀerence in the
signs of ǫ1 and ǫ2, which brings radical changes to the
spatial dependence of the ﬁeld intensities discussed be-
low.

We focus on the basic features of the process and ig-
nore the dissipation of both waves inside the nonlinear
medium; in addition, we assume that the phase match-
ing condition k2 = 2k1 is fulﬁlled. The spatially-invariant
form of the Manley-Rowe relations follows from equation
(29):

Here, κ = (ǫ2ω2

form for an arbitrary slab thickness, as shown schemati-
cally in the lower part of Fig. 1.

C. SHG in a NIM slab

Now consider phase-matched SHG in a lossless NIM
slab of a ﬁnite length L. Equations (6) and (11) take the
form:

h1(z)2 = C + h2(z)2,
dh2/dz =

κ[C + h2(z)2].

(10)

Taking into account the diﬀerent boundary conditions in
a NIM as compared to a PIM, h1(0) = h10 and h2(L) = 0,
the solution to these equations is as follows

where C is an integration constant. With ǫ1 =
ǫ2,
which is required for the phase matching, equation (10)
predicts that the diﬀerence between the squared ampli-
tudes remains constant through the sample

thickness L and on the amplitude of the incident funda-
mental radiation as

as schematically depicted in the upper part of Fig. 1.
This is in striking diﬀerence with the requirement that
the sum of the squared amplitudes is constant in the
analogous case in a PIM, as schematically shown in the
lower part of Fig. 1. We introduce now the real phases
and amplitudes as A1,2 = h1,2 exp(iφ1,2). Then the equa-
tions for the phases, which follow from Eqs. (6) and (7),
show that if any of the ﬁelds becomes zero at any point,
the integral (10) corresponds to the solution with the
φ2 = π/2 over the entire
constant phase diﬀerence 2φ1 −
sample.

The equations for the slowly-varying amplitudes cor-
responding to the ordinary coupling scheme in a PIM,
shown in the lower part of Fig. 1, are readily obtained
from Eqs.
(6) - (8) by changing the signs of k1 and
k2. This does not change the integral (10); more im-
portantly, the relation between ǫ1 and ǫ2 required by the
phase matching now changes to ǫ1 = ǫ2, where both con-
stants are positive. The phase diﬀerence remains the
same. Because of the boundary conditions h1(0) = h10
and h2(0) = h20 = 0, the integration constant becomes

√CκL = cos−1(√C/h10).

20/h2

10) = 1

Thus, the spatially invariant ﬁeld intensity diﬀerence be-
tween the fundamental and SH waves in NIMs depends
on the slab thickness, which is in strict contrast with the
case in PIMs. As seen from equation (39), the integra-
h2(z)2 now represents the
tion parameter C = h1(z)2
deviation of the conversion eﬃciency η = h2
10 from
unity: (C/h2
η. Figure 2 shows the dependence of
this parameter on the conversion length z0 = (κh10)−1.
The ﬁgure shows that for the conversion length of 2.5,
the NIM slab, which acts as nonlinear mirror, provides
about 80% conversion of the fundamental beam into a
reﬂected SH wave. Figure 3 depicts the ﬁeld distribution
along the slab. One can see from the ﬁgure that with an
increase in slab length (or intensity of the fundamental
wave), the gap between the two plots decreases while the
conversion eﬃciency increases (comparing the main plot
and the inset).

integration of (22) with the boundary condition h1(0) =
h10 yields

h2(z) =

h10
(z/z0) + 1

, z0 = (κh10)−1.

(23)

Equation (23) describes a concurrent decrease of both
waves of equal amplitudes along the z-axis; this is shown
by the dash-dot plots in Fig. 3. For z
z0, the depen-
dence is inversely proportional to z. These spatial depen-
dencies, shown in Fig. 3, are in strict contrast with those
for the conventional process of SHG in a PIM, which are
known from various textbooks (compare, for example,
with the lower part of Fig.1).

III. OPTICAL PARAMETRIC AMPLIFICATION
AND DIFFERENCE-FREQUENCY
GENERATION IN A NIM SLAB WITH
ABSORPTION

A. OPA: basic equations and Manley-Rowe
relations

As mentioned in Subsection II A, S is counterdirected
with respect to k in NIMs, because ǫ < 0 and µ < 0.
We assume that a left-handed wave at ω1 travels with its
wave-vector directed along the z-axis. Then its energy
ﬂow S1 is directed against the z-axis. We also assume
that the sample is illuminated by a higher-frequency
electromagnetic wave traveling along the axis z. The
frequency of this radiation ω3 falls in a positive index
range. The two coupled waves with co-directed wave-
vectors k3 and k1 generate a diﬀerence-frequency idler at
ω1, which has a positive refractive index. The
ω2 = ω3 −
idle wave contributes back into the wave at ω1 through
three-wave coupling and thus enables optical paramet-
ric ampliﬁcation (OPA) at ω1 by converting the energy
of the pump ﬁeld at ω3. Thus, the nonlinear-optical pro-
cess under consideration involves three-wave mixing with
wave-vectors co-directed along z. Note that the energy
ﬂow of the signal wave, S1, is directed against z, i.e., it
is directed opposite to the energy ﬂows of the two other
waves, S2 and S3 (Fig. 4, the left part). Such a coupling
scheme is in contrast with the ordinary phase-matching
scheme for OPA, which is schematically shown in the
right part of Fig. 4. As above, we consider the magnetic
type of the quadratic nonlinearity. For the magnetic ﬁeld

D. SHG in a semi-inﬁnite NIM

Now we consider the case of a semi-inﬁnite NIM at
z > 0. Since both waves disappear at z
due to
the entire conversion of the fundamental beam into SH,
C = 0. Then equations (39) and (17) for the amplitudes

three fundamental diﬀerences in equation (27) as com-
pared with the ordinary diﬀerence-frequency generation
(DFG) through the three-wave mixing of co-propagating
waves in a PIM. First, the sign of σ1 is opposite to that
of σ2 because ǫ1 < 0. Second, the opposite sign appears
with α1 because the energy ﬂow S1 is directed against
the z-axis. Third, the boundary conditions for h1 are
deﬁned at the opposite side of the sample as compared
to h2 and h3 because their energy-ﬂows S1 and S2 are
counter-directed.

These equations represent the Manley-Rowe relations
[15], which describe the creation of pairs of entangled
counter-propagating photons ~ω1 and ~ω2. The equa-
tions account for the opposite sign of the corresponding
derivatives with respect to z. Equation (30) predicts that
the sum of the terms proportional to the squared ampli-
tudes of signal and idler remains constant through the
sample, which is in contrast with the requirement that
the diﬀerence of such terms is constant in the analogous
case in a PIM. We note that according to Eqs. (4) and
(5) the corresponding equations for the electric compo-
nents in the case of the quadratic electric nonlinearity can
be written in a similar form with ǫj substituted by µj.

As seen from the equations below, this does not change
either the results obtained or the main conclusions pre-
sented here; the same is true for the case of SHG. As
mentioned in Section II, the factors µj were usually as-
sumed equal to unity in equations for PIMs, which is not
the case for NIMs.

The dependence of the output intensity for the left-
handed wave propagating in an absorptive NIM slab in
the presence of the control ﬁeld at ω3 and at a20 = 0 is
shown with the solid line in Fig. 5 for two representa-
tive cases of exact and partial phase-matching. The dash
plots show the output in the case of DFG (at a1L = 0,

reaches many orders in the ﬁrst maximum and increases
in the next maximums. It is seen that the ampliﬁcation
can entirely compensate for absorption and even turn into
oscillations when the intensity of the control ﬁeld reaches
values given by a periodic set of increasing numbers. The
larger the corresponding value, the greater is the ampliﬁ-
cation and the DFG output; the latter depends on the ab-
sorption for both waves and on the phase mismatch ∆k.
The conversion factor is larger in its maximums than the
ampliﬁcation factor because DFG is a one-step process,
whereas OPA is a two-step process as discussed in Sub-
section III A. As seen from Fig. 5, the output shows a
resonance dependence on the intensity of the control ﬁeld
at ω3. Figure 6 depicts corresponding changes in the dis-
tribution of the negative-index ﬁeld inside the slab in the
vicinity of the ﬁrst maximum at ∆k = 0.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied the unusual properties of second-
harmonic generation (SHG) in metamaterials that have
a negative refractive index for the fundamental wave and
a positive index for its second harmonic (SH). The pos-
sibility of a left-handed nonlinear-optical mirror, which
converts the incoming radiation into a reﬂected beam

at the doubled frequency with eﬃciency that can ap-
proach 100% for lossless and phase-matched medium is
considered. The most striking diﬀerences in the nonlinear
propagation and the spatial dependence of the energy-
conversion process for SHG in NIMs, as compared to
PIMs, can be summarized as follows. In NIMs, the in-
tensities of the fundamental and SH waves both decrease
along the medium. Such unusual dependence and the
apparent contradiction with the ordinary Manley-Rowe
relations are explained by the fact that the energy ﬂows
for the fundamental and SH waves are counter-directed,
whereas their wave-vectors are co-directed. Another in-
teresting characteristic of SHG in NIMs is that the energy
conversion at any point within a NIM slab depends on
the total thickness of the slab. This is because SHG in a
NIM is determined by the boundary condition for SH at
the rear interface rather than the front interface of the
slab.

We have shown the feasibility of compensating losses in
NIMs by optical parametric ampliﬁcation (OPA). In this
process, the wave-vectors of all three coupled waves are
co-directed, whereas the energy ﬂow for the signal wave is
counter-directed with respect to those for the pump and
the idler waves. This process is characterized by prop-
erties that are in strict contrast with those known for
conventional nonlinear-optical crystals. Such extraordi-
nary features allow one to realize optical parametric os-
cillations (OPOs) without a cavity at frequencies where
the refractive index is negative. We also showed that the

7

OPA and OPO in NIMs enable the generation of pairs
of entangled counter-propagating right- and left-handed
photons inside the NIM slabs.

The backward energy ﬂow for one of the coupled waves
(whereas the wave-vectors of all the coupled waves are
co-directed) is inherent for NIMs and it makes this pro-
cess diﬀerent from three-wave mixing in PIMs. This is
also diﬀerent from various processes in RHMs based on
distributed gratings and feedback. The important ad-
vantage of the backward OPA and OPO in NIMs inves-
tigated here is the distributed feedback, which enables
oscillations without a cavity. In NIMs, each spatial point
serves as a source for the generated wave in the reﬂected
direction, whereas the phase velocities of all the three
coupled waves are co-directed. As mentioned, it is very
hard to realize such a scheme in PIMs, while the OPA in
NIMs proposed herein is free from the PIM limitations.

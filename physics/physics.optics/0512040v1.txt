The silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) interface plays
a crucial role in the performance, cost, and re-
liability of most modern microelectronic devices[1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
from the basic transistor to
ﬂash memory, digital cameras, and solar cells. To-
day the gate oxide thickness of modern transistors
is roughly 5 atomic layers, with 8 metal wire lay-
ers required to transport all the signals within a
microprocessor.
In addition to the increasing la-
tency of such reduced-dimension metal wires, further
“Moore’s Law” scaling of transistor cost and density
is predicted to saturate in the next decade[9]. As a
result, silicon-based microphotonics is being explored
for the routing and generation of high-bandwidth
signals[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
In comparison
to the extensive knowledge of the electronic proper-
ties of the Si/SiO2 interface, little is known about the
optical properties of Si surfaces used in micropho-
tonics. In this Letter, we explore the optical prop-
erties of the Si surface in the telecommunication-
relevant wavelength band of λ = 1400-1600 nm. Uti-
lizing a high quality factor (Q ∼ 1.5 × 106) optical
microresonator[17] to provide sensitivity down to a
s ∼ 10−7, we show
fractional surface optical loss of α′
that optical loss within Si microphotonic components
can be dramatically altered by Si surface prepara-
s ∼ 2×10−5 measured for chemical oxide
tion, with α′
s ≤ 2×10−6 for hydrogen-
surfaces as compared to α′
terminated Si surfaces. These results indicate that
the optical properties of Si surfaces can be signiﬁ-
cantly and reversibly altered by standard microelec-
tronics treatments, and that stable, high optical qual-
ity surface passivation layers will be critical in future
Si micro- and nano-photonic systems.

Historically, studies of Si surface and interface states
have primarily focused on their electronic properties,
with sensitive techniques such as deep-level transient
spectroscopy[18] or surface-sensitive minority carrier life-
time measurements[6] being employed. Three exceptions
to this are deep-level optical spectroscopy[19], cavity-
ringdown spectroscopy[20], and the ultra-sensitive tech-
nique of photothermal deﬂection spectroscopy (PDS)[21,
22] which can measure fractional optical absorption down
to αl ∼ 10−8. None of the aforementioned techniques,
is well suited for studying as-processed mi-
however,

crophotonic elements. In this work we utilize a specially
designed microdisk optical resonator to study the optical
properties of surfaces typical in silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
microphotonic elements in a noninvasive, rapid, and sen-
sitive manner. Shown in Figure 1, the high quality fac-
tor (Q) Si microdisk resonators used in this work provide
surface-speciﬁc optical sensitivity due to the strong over-
lap of the top and bottom surfaces of the active Si layer
with the electric ﬁeld energy density of appropriately po-
larized bound optical modes of the microdisk. In addi-
tion, light within these micron-scale structures circulates
tens of thousands of times, providing an eﬀective path
length approaching one meter.

A normalized measure of surface sensitivity for a
guided-wave mode in a waveguide or resonator can be
deﬁned as Γ′
s ≡ Γs/ts, where Γs is the fractional electric
ﬁeld energy overlap with a surface perturbation of phys-
ical depth ts. If optical loss is dominated by interactions
with the surface, then the modal loss coeﬃcient per unit
length (αm) measured from experiment can be related to
a fractional loss per pass through the surface given by
s = αm/Γ′
α′
[23], for a true two-

s. As discussed in Ref.

dimensional surface in which the perturbation depth is
inﬁnitesimal, α′
s is the most relevant quantity describing
the surface and is equivalent to the fraction of power lost
for a normal incident plane wave propagating across the
surface. α′
s is an important property of all surfaces in
optics, yet it has historically rarely been measured[22],
and is unknown today even for many important sur-
faces such as the c-Si surfaces studied here. From ﬁnite-
element method (FEM) simulations[24], shown in Figure
1, the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization whispering-
gallery-modes (WGMs) of the microdisk are ∼ 90× more
sensitive to the top and bottom h100i Si surfaces than the
etched sidewall at the microdisk periphery; speciﬁcally,
Γ′
side = 8.1 × 10−5
top = Γ′
nm−1. This implies that ∼ 0.2% of the optical mode
exists in a single monolayer at the top (bottom) Si sur-
face, while little of the mode sees imperfections at the
microdisk perimeter. At this level of sensitivity, a WGM
with a Q = 1.5 × 106 (similar to the values measured
in devices described below) can be used to measure frac-
s ∼ 10−7.
tional loss through the Si surface as small as α′
Such high-Q resonators can also be used to measure dis-
persive eﬀects[25] of the Si surface chemistry with a sen-
sitivity corresponding to 0.04% of a Si monolayer, or
roughly ∼ 104 Si atoms for a 5 µm radius microdisk.

bot = 3.5 × 10−3 nm−1 and Γ′

The silicon microdisks studied in this work were fab-
ricated from an SOI wafer commercially available from
SOITEC, consisting of a 217 nm thick silicon device layer
(p-type, 14 − 20 Ω·cm resistivity, h100i orientation) with
a 2 µm SiO2 buried oxide (BOX) layer. Microdisks of 5
and 10 µm radius were fabricated[26], ﬁnishing with a 10
minute acetone soak and Piranha etch to remove organic
materials. A 1 hour dilute hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) solu-
tion comprised of ﬁve parts 18.3 MΩ deionized (DI) water
to one part concentrated aqueous HF (49%) was used to
remove a protective SiNx cap and partially undercut the
disk, as shown in the SEM micrograph in Figure 1(a).

The wafer was then rinsed in deionized water, dried with
nitrogen (N2), and immediately transferred into an N2
purged testing enclosure.

The microdisk resonators were characterized using
a tunable external-cavity laser (λ = 1420-1498 nm,
linewidth < 5 MHz) connected to a computer-controlled
ﬁber taper waveguide probe[27]. The micron-scale ﬁber
taper probe was formed from a standard single-mode
optical ﬁber and was used to evanescently excite the
WGMs of the microdisk with controllable loading. Figure
2 shows the normalized spectral transmission response
of a 5 µm radius microdisk resonator, illustrating clear
families of modes having similar linewidth, δλ, and free-
spectral-range (FSR). By comparison to FEM simula-
tions of the Si microdisk, each mode in Figure 2 was
categorized and labelled as TMp,m, where p and m are
the radial and azimuthal number, respectively.

Owing to their large surface sensitivity (see Figure 1),
the spectral signature of the TM1,m modes was used
to determine the quality of the optical surfaces. Fig-
ure 2(b) shows a high resolution scan across the TM1,31
mode. The observed double resonance dip, termed a dou-
blet, is a result of surface roughness coupling of the nor-
mally degenerate clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise
(CCW) propagating WGMs[26, 28, 29]. The rate at
which photons are back-scattered is quantiﬁed by the
doublet splitting, ∆λ, while the rate at which photons
are lost from the resonator is quantiﬁed by the intrinsic
linewidth, δλ, of the individual doublet modes. From a
ﬁt to the transmission spectrum of Fig. 2(b), ∆λ = 11.9
pm and δλ = 2.2 pm, corresponding to an intrinsic modal
quality factor of Qi ≡ λ0/δλ = 6.8×105 for this TM1,31
mode. This should be contrasted with the transmission
spectrum shown in Fig. 2(c) for a more conﬁned, and
less surface sensitive, TE WGM of a much larger 40 µm
radius microdisk. From the ﬁt parameters (∆λ = 0.8
pm, δλ = 0.3 pm), the Q of the buried TE mode is

3

of the TM1,m to the top and bottom Si surfaces (compar-
ison of the TM and TE modes in the same microdisk and
with similar modal overlap with the microdisk edge bear
this out). Damage to the top and bottom Si surfaces can
stem from a variety of possible sources including chemi-
cal mechanical polishing, native oxide formation during
storage, or adventitious organic matter[3]. In an attempt
to repair the Si surfaces a series of chemical oxidation
treatments were performed on the devices. The well-
known process [2, 6, 30] of repeated chemical oxidation
in Piranha (H2SO4/H2O2) and HF oxide stripping was
employed to controllably prepare the Si surfaces. Three
cycles of the Piranha/HF process, recipe shown in Table
I, were applied to the as-processed devices. From the
blue-shift in the WGM resonances due to the three cy-
cles of the Piranha/HF process, an estimated 1.9 ± 0.1
nm of Si was removed from the surface of the microdisk.
The ﬁt to the TM1,31 transmission spectrum, shown in
Figure 3(b), indicates that a signiﬁcant improvement to
the surfaces has also taken place, yielding a ∆λ = 7.2 pm
and δλ = 1.1 pm.

To separate the eﬀects of the Piranha oxidation
and the HF etch, the sample was put through a Pi-
ranha/HF/Piranha treatment. The ﬁrst cycle of Pi-
ranha/HF was used to “refresh” the hydrogen passivation
before re-oxidizing the Si surface with Piranha. Figure
3(c) shows the ﬁt to the now barely resolvable TM1,31
doublet yielding ∆λ = 8.6 pm and δλ = 5.6 pm. The
ﬁve-fold increase in linewidth and a negligible increase in
doublet splitting is indicative of a signiﬁcant activation
of absorbing surface states without an increase in surface
scattering. Removing the chemical oxide with the HF
dip listed in Table I and retesting indicated that an oxide
ﬁlm equivalent to 2.8 ± 0.1 nm of SiO2 had been present.
The ﬁt to the transmission spectrum of the TM1,31 mode
in Figure 3(d) yielded ﬁt parameters ∆λ = 9.7 pm and
δλ = 1.2 pm, showing that the optical damage to the Si
surfaces caused by Piranha oxidation was reversible.

As a ﬁnal treatment to the 5 µm radii microdisks, we
used the same 3× oxidation and stripping process as de-
scribed in Table I, but with an HCl based chemistry
(8:1:2 H20:HCl:H2O2, heated to 60◦ C) instead of the
H2SO4 based chemistry. Figure 3(e-f) shows a graphi-
cal representation of the average behavior of all TM1,m
modes in the 1420-1470 nm span after each chemical
treatment. The results reveal that the HCl oxidation
was slightly less eﬀective at passivating the silicon sur-
face than the Piranha oxidation; however, it is expected
that the optimum solution for chemical oxidation will de-
pend upon the Si crystal orientation and previous chem-
ical treatments[5, 8].

Although it has recently been observed[30] that re-
peated chemical oxidation and removal of silicon can pro-
vide a smoothing action on etched sidewalls, the large
shifts in optical loss with chemical treatment described
above can be linked to surface-state absorption as op-
posed to surface-scattering. Whereas the highly conﬁned
Si waveguide measurements to date have been sensitive

Qi = 4.7×106, corresponding to a loss per unit length
of αi = 0.13 dB/cm. This is nearly an order of mag-
nitude smaller optical loss than that of the as-processed
TM1,m modes, and provides an upper bound on the bulk
Si optical loss of the SOI material.

The stark diﬀerence between the surface-sensitive TM
and bulk TE modes indicates that the as-processed Si
surfaces are far from optimal. Etch-induced surface dam-
age on the microdisk sidewall can only account for a small
fraction of this diﬀerence due to the enhanced sensitivity

to changes in loss as low as 1 dB/cm, the microdisks
of this work are sensitive to changes of loss more than
an order of magnitude smaller (< 0.03 dB/cm) where
surface chemistry is more likely to play a role. Indeed,
as mentioned above the TM-polarized microdisk WGMs
are selectively sensitive to the top and bottom Si surfaces
which are extremely smooth in comparison to etched sur-
faces. The negligible change in average mode-splitting,
∆λ, with chemical treatment (Figure 3(f)) is also indica-
tive of little change in surface roughness.

In order to conﬁrm the above assumption, and to mea-
sure the eﬃcacy of the surface-state passivation of the
Piranha/HF chemistry, the wavelength dependent opti-
cal quality was measured on 10 µm radii disks subjected
to a 6× Piranha/HF treatment. FEM simulations show
that 10 µm radii disk have approximately the same frac-
tional energy overlap with the top/bottom Si surfaces
(Γ′
bot = 3.7 × 10−3 nm−1) as 5 µm radii disks but
have roughly half the fractional energy overlap with the
side = 3.8 × 10−5 nm−1). Figure 4

shows a plot of the wavelength dependent loss across the
full 1420 − 1500 nm span for the TM1,m modes of a 10
µm radius disk, showing a strong trend towards increas-
ing optical loss with wavelength. The black line indicates
the intrinsic linewidth for each m number, with an error
bar of ±0.05 pm per point (not shown). The separation
of scattering loss and linear absorption was obtained us-
ing a modiﬁed version of the power dependent measure-
ments described in Reference [26]. This technique uses
the local temperature increase of the silicon microdisk to
determine the absorption component of loss, similar to
PDS, but without the need for a thermal model for heat
ﬂow; rather, the onset of two-photon absorption changes
the fraction of absorption as a function of power, allow-
ing the linear absorption coeﬃcient to be ascertained di-
rectly. The inset to Fig. 4 shows three examples of power
dependent transmission spectra for the 1447.5 nm mode
(grey arrow), along with corresponding transmission min-
ima versus wavelength (black dots).

From the optical loss measurements of Fig. 4 it is
clear that a signiﬁcant fraction of residual optical loss,
after Piranha/HF treatment and hydrogen surface passi-
vation, is still due to surface-state absorption (bulk ab-
sorption is negligible at this level). The strong trend of
increasing optical loss with wavelength is seen to be domi-
nated by elastic scattering and/or radiation loss, with the
surface-state absorption being relatively constant across
the λ = 1420-1500 nm spectrum. Through measurements
of the radiation limited quality factors of TM1,m modes
in the longer wavelength 1565-1625 nm band, intrinsic
radiation losses from the circular microdisk are found to
contribute negligibly to the losses in Fig. 4. FEM sim-
ulations also show that Γ′ on all of the surfaces changed
less than 5% over the λ = 1420-1500 nm span. The most
likely explanation for the observed wavelength dependant
loss is improved phase-matching of surface-scattering into
radiation modes with increasing wavelength.

By comparing the cavity Q before and after the Pi-
ranha oxide removal, a fractional surface absorption loss
′
s,ox ∼ 2×10−5 is estimated for the Piranha
per pass of α
oxide. This large fractional absorption in the λ = 1400
nm wavelength band (~ω ∼ 0.85 eV) is attributed to
single-photon absorption by mid-gap interface states.
Such electronic interface states at the Si/(Piranha)SiOx
interface have been observed in Ref. [4], with three sets
of state-density maxima in the bandgap of silicon oc-
curring at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 eV above the valence-band
maximum. In comparison, from Figure 4, the modal ab-
sorption loss of the hydrogen-passivated Si surface is as
m ∼ 0.08 cm−1, corresponding to a fractional
small as αH
′
s,H ∼ 2×10−6 for
surface absorption loss per pass of α
the top (bottom) Si active layer surface.

All of the measurements described above were per-
formed in a N2 purged environment over several weeks.
Even in such an environment, however, changes in the
hydrogen passivated surfaces were observed over times
as short as a few days. Left in an unprotected air envi-
ronment, degradation of the optical surface quality was

evident in a matter of hours. Research and development
of stable surface passivation techniques optimized for op-
tical quality, akin to the gate oxides of CMOS micro-
electronics, will be a key ingredient in the future devel-
opment of Si photonics. Our data suggests that surface
chemistry as much as surface roughness will ultimately

limit the performance of Si microphotonic devices, and
further development of Si passivation techniques should
be able to reduce optical losses by as much as an order
of magnitude (towards the bulk c-Si limit) while simul-
taneously improving the stability and manufacturability
of future Si photonic components.

ABSTRACT: On interrogation by a plane wave, the back–scattering eﬃciency of a nihility

sphere is identically zero, and its extinction and forward–scattering eﬃciencies are higher than

those of a perfectly conducting sphere.

Keywords: back–scattering eﬃciency; extinction eﬃciency; forward–scattering eﬃciency; ni-

hility

INTRODUCTION

The concept of nihility as an electromagnetic medium has emerged [1] from the rather extraor-

dinary developments on negatively refracting materials during this decade [2, 3]. Whereas the

relative permittivity and relative permeability of vacuum are ǫr = µr = 1, and those of anti–

vacuum are ǫr = µr =

1, those of nihility are ǫr = µr = 0. The so–called perfect lens of

−

Pendry [4] is made of anti–vacuum [5], and any perfect lens in the present context is required

to simulate nihility [5, 6].

Although quite some attention has been devoted to the electromagnetic response characteris-

tics of anti–vacuum (or some approximation thereof), nihility has been neglected in comparison

[7, 8]. Reﬂection and refraction of plane waves due to nihility half–spaces has recently been

reported [9], and so has the plane–wave response of nihility slabs [5, 6]. Along the same lines,

this communication focuses on the plane–wave response of a nihility sphere. An exp(

time–dependence is implicit in the following sections.

2 THEORY

Consider the spherical region r < a occupied by nihility, whereas the region r > a is vacuous.

Without loss of generality, the incident plane wave is taken to be linearly polarized and traveling

along the +z axis; thus,

Einc(r) = E0 ˆux exp(ik0z) ,

where E0 is the amplitude, k0 is the free–space wavenumber, and ˆux is the unit vector parallel

to the +x axis.

As is commonplace, the incident plane wave is represented in terms of vector spherical

harmonics M(j)

σmn(w) and N(j)

σmn(w) [10, 11] as follows:

of the nihility sphere as a function of its normalized radius ξ. The overall proﬁle is similar to

that for a perfectly conducting sphere [13], which is also shown in the same ﬁgure, but extinction

by the nihility sphere is larger than that by a perfectly conducting sphere. Furthermore, the

peak extinction by a nihility sphere occurs at a larger value of ξ (

2.981) than by a perfectly

≈

conducting sphere (ξ

1.209).

Calculations associated with (4) and (5) show that no electromagnetic ﬁeld exists inside

nihility spheres. Hence, there is no absorption, and the extinction eﬃciency equals the total

scattering eﬃciency [11]

= 0 for perfectly conducting spheres [12, 13].

Equation (13) is a remarkable result, because it implies that the probability of detection of a

nihility sphere by a monostatic radar system is very low. This result would not change even if the

ambient (isotropic) medium were to have relative permittivity and relative permeability other

than unity. This conclusion can be understood by realizing that nihility is impedance–matched

to any isotropic, achiral, dielectric–magnetic medium [14].

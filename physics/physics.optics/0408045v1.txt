Abstract

Under certain circumstances, Voigt waves can propagate in a biaxial composite
medium even though the component material phases individually do not support Voigt
wave propagation. This phenomenon is considered within the context of the strong–
permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory. A generalized implementation of the theory is devel-
oped in order to explore the propagation of Voigt waves in any direction. It is shown
that the correlation length — a parameter characterizing the distributional statistics
of the component material phases — plays a crucial role in facilitating the propagation
of Voigt waves in the homogenized composite medium.

Keywords: Strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory, singular axes, homogenized composite
mediums, Voigt waves

1 Introduction

A deﬁning characteristic of metamaterials is that they exhibit behaviour which is not exhib-
ited by their component phases [1]. A prime example is provided by homogenized composite
mediums (HCMs) which support Voigt wave propagation despite their component material
phases not doing so [2]. Although they were discovered over 100 years ago [3], Voigt waves
are not widely known in the optics/electromagnetics community. However, they have re-
cently become the subject of renewed interest [4, 5], and the more so in light of advances in
complex composite mediums [6].

A Voigt wave is an anomalous plane wave which can develop in certain anisotropic medi-
ums when the associated propagation matrix is not diagonalizable [7]. The unusual property
of a Voigt wave is that its amplitude is linearly dependent upon the propagation distance
[8].

In a recent study, the Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman homogenization formalisms were
applied to show that Voigt waves may propagate in biaxial HCMs provided that their

component material phases are inherently dissipative [2]. However, the Maxwell Garnett
and Bruggeman formalisms — like many widely–used homogenization formalisms [9] — do
not take account of coherent scattering losses. The strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory
(SPFT) provides an alternative approach in which a more comprehensive description of the
distributional statistics of the component material phases is accommodated [10, 11]. In the
bilocally–approximated implementation of the SPFT, a two–point covariance function and
its associated correlation length L characterize the component phase distributions. Coherent
interactions between pairs of scattering centres within a region of linear dimensions L are
thereby considered in the SPFT, but scattering centres separated by distances much greater
than L are assumed to act independently. Thus, the SPFT provides an estimation of coher-
ent scattering losses, unlike the Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms. In fact, the
bilocally–approximated SPFT gives rise to the Bruggeman homogenization formalism in the
limit L

0 [12].

In the following sections, we consider Voigt wave propagation in a biaxial two–phase
HCM within the context of the SPFT. A generalized SPFT implementation is developed in
order to explore the propagation of Voigt waves in any direction. The unit Cartesian vectors
are denoted as ˆx, ˆy and ˆz. Double underlined quantities are 3
3 dyadics. The wavenumber
of free space (i.e., vacuum) is k0.

2.1 Component phases

The propagation of Voigt waves in a two–phase homogenized composite medium (HCM)
is investigated. Both component material phases are taken as uniaxial dielectric mediums.
Therefore, they do not individually support Voigt wave propagation [7].

Let the components phases — labelled as a and b — be characterized by the relative

permittivity dyadics

ǫa = R z(ϕ) • [ǫx
ǫb = ǫx

b ˆx ˆx + ǫb ( ˆy ˆy + ˆz ˆz )

a ˆx ˆx + ǫa ( ˆy ˆy + ˆz ˆz )] • RT

respectively. The preferred axis of component material phase a is rotated under the action
of

R z(ϕ) = cos ϕ ( ˆx ˆx + ˆy ˆy ) + sin ϕ ( ˆx ˆy

ˆy ˆx ) + ˆz ˆz ,

−

to lie in the xy plane at an angle ϕ to the x axis, whereas the preferred axis of component
phase b is aligned with the x axis, without loss of generality. The superscript T indicates the
transpose operation.

Let the regions occupied by component phases a and b be denoted by Va and Vb, respec-
tively. The component phases are randomly distributed such that all space V = Va
Vb.
Spherical microstructural geometries, with characteristic length scales which are small in
comparison with electromagnetic wavelengths, are assumed for both component phases. The

2.2 Homogenized composite medium

Since the preferred axes of the uniaxial component phases are not generally aligned, the
HCM is a biaxial dielectric medium. We conﬁne ourselves to the bilocally approximated
SPFT in order to estimate the HCM relative permittivity dyadic

ǫ ba = ǫx

ba ˆx ˆx + ǫy

ba ˆy ˆy + ǫz

ba ˆz ˆz + ǫt

ba (ˆx ˆy + ˆy ˆx) .

The SPFT is based upon iterative reﬁnements of a comparison medium. The relative per-
mittivity dyadic of the comparison medium, namely,

ǫ Br = ǫx

Br ˆx ˆx + ǫy

Br ˆy ˆy + ǫz

Br ˆz ˆz + ǫt

Br (ˆx ˆy + ˆy ˆx) ,

is provided by the Bruggeman homogenization formalism [12].

2.3 Depolarization and polarizability dyadics

The depolarization dyadic D is central to both the Bruggeman formalism and the SPFT.
It provides the electromagnetic response of a inﬁnitesimally small spherical exclusion re-
gion, immersed in a homogeneous background. For the comparison medium with relative
permittivity dyadic ǫ Br, the corresponding depolarization dyadic is given by[15]

3 Voigt wave propagation

In order to explore the possibility of Voigt wave propagation — in any direction — it is
expedient to consider the HCM relative permittivity dyadic (5) in the rotated coordinate
frame speciﬁed by the three Euler angles α, β and γ [17]. On rotation, ǫ ba transforms to

ˆǫ ba(α, β, γ) = R z(γ) • R y(β) • R z(α) • ǫ ba

4 Numerical results

The numerical calculations proceed in two stages: Firstly, ǫ ba is estimated using the bilo-
cally approximated SPFT for a representative example; secondly, the quantities Y (α, β, γ)
and W (α, β, γ) are calculated as functions of the Euler angles. In particular, the (α, β, γ)
angular coordinates of the zeros of Y , and the corresponding values of W at those (α, β, γ)
coordinates, are sought. The γ angular coordinate is disregarded since propagation parallel
to the z axis (of the rotated coordinate system) is independent of rotation about that axis.
The following constitutive parameters were selected for the component phases a and b

for all results presented here:

x = 2.5 + i 0.1 δ,

Consider the four relative permittivity scalars, ǫx,y,z,t

values calculated with the dissipation parameter δ = 1 are
plotted in Figure 1, as functions of the orientation angle ϕ of component phase a and the
relative correlation length Lk0. At ϕ = 0 (and also at ϕ = π), the preferred axes of both
component phases are aligned. Accordingly, the HCM is uniaxial with ǫx

The HCM constitutive parameters corresponding to those of Figure 1, but arising from
nondissipative component phases (i.e., δ = 0), are presented in Figure 2. The absence of

. However, the

imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z,t
are much altered. Since the component phases are nondissipative,
the imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z,t
are null–valued at zero correlation length. As the correlation
length increases, the loss due to the eﬀects of coherent scattering becomes greater. Hence,
the magnitudes of the imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z,t
are observed to increase in Figure 2 as Lk0
grows. Furthermore, it is clear from Figure 2 that the rate of increase of these imaginary
parts is sensitively dependent upon the orientation angle ϕ of the component phase a.

4.2 Zeros of Y

The condition Y = 0 can be satisﬁed at two distinct HCM orientations. These orientations
are denoted by the angular coordinates (α1, β1) and (α2, β2). With the normalized correlation
length ﬁxed at Lk0 = 0.1, the (α1, β1) and (α2, β2) angular coordinates are graphed as
functions of ϕ in Figure 3 for the dissipation parameter values δ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1. In
particular, observe that the two distinct solutions of Y (α, β, 0) = 0 exist even when the
component material phases are nondissipative (i.e., δ = 0). The angular coordinates (α1, β1)
and (α2, β2) are clearly sensitive to both ϕ and δ.

inequality
resolution). Therefore, Voigt waves can propagate along two distinct singular axes in the
biaxial HCM, as speciﬁed by the angular coordinates (α1, β1) and (α2, β2), even when the
HCM arises from nondissipative component phases. This conclusion stems solely from the
incorporation of the correlation length in the SPFT, because the Maxwell Garnett and the
Bruggeman formalisms would not predict Voigt wave propagation when both component
phases are nondissipative [2].

two distinct directions described by (α1, β1) and (α2, β2) are sensitively dependent upon the
orientation angle ϕ of the component phase a. Furthermore, the two distinct directions
persist in the limit Lk0
0. The inﬂuence of Lk0 upon the angular coordinates (α1, β1) and
(α2, β2) (as illustrated in Figure 5) is relatively minor in comparison with the inﬂuence of
the dissipation parameter δ (as illustrated in Figure 3).

the orientations of the singular axes, along which Voigt waves may propagate in the biaxial
HCM, are modulated only to a minor degree by the correlation length.

5 Conclusions

The role of the correlation length in facilitating the propagation of Voigt waves in HCMs is
delineated. Thereby, the importance of taking higher–order distributional statistics in ho-
mogenization studies into account is further emphasized. Speciﬁcally, we have demonstrated
that

1. Voigt waves can propagate in HCMs arising from nondissipative component phases,
provided that a nonzero correlation length is accommodated, according to the SPFT.

2. The orientations of singular axes in HCMs are sensitively dependent upon (i) the
degree of dissipation exhibited by the component phases and the (ii) the orientation of
the preferred axes of the component material phases. By comparison, the correlation
length plays only a secondary role in determining the singular axis orientations.

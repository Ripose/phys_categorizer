We predict that spatial self-trapping of light can occur in soft matter encompassing a wide class
of new materials such as colloids, foams, gels, fractal aggregates etc. We develop a general nonlocal
theory that allows to relate the properties of the trapped state of Maxwell equations to the measur-
able static structure factor of the speciﬁc material. We give numerical evidence for stable trapping
in fractal aggregates and suggest also the possibility of soliton spectroscopy of soft-matter.

Self-trapping of light beams, predicted forty years ago
is still a subject of great interest [2, 3]. Obser-
[1],
vation of optical spatial solitons (OSS) at low (down
to mW) power levels, demonstrated in photorefractive
or liquid crystals, makes OSS attractive candidates in
several applications of emerging photonics technology,
[4, 5, 6], and have driven successful eﬀorts to understand-
ing the role played by speciﬁc material properties such
as anisotropy and/or nonlocality in self-trapping mecha-
nisms. Yet, the description of light trapping seems still
strongly material dependent, and, as such, cannot be ap-
plied to a whole class of condensed matter, namely soft
matter (SM), which encompasses the important case of
bio-matter where OSS can ﬁnd new applications (e.g.,
laser surgery, optical manipulation of nano-particles).
Roughly speaking, softness is generally due to a charac-
teristic mesoscopic (i.e., larger than atomic) length scale
of the constituents, and an energy scale comparable to
room temperature thermal energy. As a consequence,
SM properties can be easily tailored via external ﬁeld of
diﬀerent (mechanical, electrical, magnetic, thermal, ...)
origin. SM includes colloidal suspensions, emulsions, and
foams (all involving diﬀerent constituents in a host ﬂuid),
and typical examples are polymers in a liquid, glues, li-
posomes, blood, and all sort of bio-matter [7].

Historically, the use of aerosols and water suspension
of dielectric spheres as nonlinear media dates back to
the early 80’s [8, 9]. However, in these materials elec-
trostriction has been described in the framework of sim-
ple models that treat the diluted constituents as a gas of
non-interacting particles, in terms of local index change
of the Kerr type (∆n = n2I where I is the local intensity)
[1, 8, 9]. As a consequence existence of stable OSS in two
transverse dimensions is ruled out by the occurrence of
the well-known catastrophic self-focusing instability [10].
Phenomenologically, stabilization can be expected from
the index saturation arising from the maximum pack-
ing fraction of the dispersed particles. However, before
reaching such a regime, the physics of these materials,
and in general of other SM systems, is well-known to
be aﬀected by particle-particle interactions. In particu-
lar, this occurs whenever the particle-particle correlation
function g(r) is structured on a length scale comparable

to the laser beam waist. Under these conditions a non-
local model for self-focusing in SM must be considered.

In this letter, we propose a novel general approach to
stationary self-focusing, linking for the ﬁrst time the elec-
trostrictive nonlocal response of SM to its static structure
factor S(q) (roughly speaking, the Fourier transform of
the particle-particle correlation function), usually mea-
sured by means of scattering experiments. This allows
us (i) to predict stable propagation of two-dimensional
OSS in a new wide class of condensed matter, and (ii) to
assess the importance that ultra-focused laser light can
have to investigate the properties of SM. Both issues are
of paramount importance in order to go towards a more
general description of solitons in complex media (fractal
aggregates, structured and supercooled liquid, etc.) and
their application in bio-photonics as well as to develop a
new spectroscopic tool for the investigation of SM prop-
erties.

Assuming a linearly polarized beam and exploiting
isotropy of system, we start from the unidirectional scalar
wave equation written for a monochromatic beam with
complex amplitude E(x, y, z) propagating along z [11]

that the nonlinear polarization is responsible for a refrac-
tive index change ∆n, i. e. Pnl(E) = ∆χE = 2n0∆nE,
which is dominated by an electrostrictive contribution
(fast electronic nonlinearities as well as index change due
to thermal heating by optical absorption are usually neg-
ligible, and we also neglect scattering). This legitimates
our scalar (polarization-indipendent) approach [12], re-
gardless of beam spectral content [at variance with Kerr
eﬀect of electronic origin where the non-paraxial regime
at very high intensities requires to account for vectorial
eﬀects (see e.g. [13])].

Since the electrostriction ∆n = ρ(∂n/∂ρ)ρ0 is propor-
tional to the particle number density change ρ (from
equilibrium value ρ0), Eq.
(1) must be coupled to an
evolution equation for ρ. A widely accepted and largely
applicable theory for SM is the so-called Mode-Coupling

Theory (MCT) [14, 15, 16] which relies on the so-called
Zwangig-Mori formalism (given some observable, like ρ,
it allows to write closed equations for it and for its cor-
relations functions [17]). By exploiting MCT (see also
[18]), we ﬁnd that the density perturbation ˜ρ = ˜ρ(q, t)
in Fourier space q = (qx, qy, qz), obeys the dynamical
equation:

¨˜ρ(q, t) + q2 kB T

where tilde denotes 3D spatial Fourier transform, η =
(µ0/ǫ0n2
0)1/2 is the impedance, kB is the Boltzman con-
stant, T is the temperature, m(t) is the memory function
of the system (for a simple liquid m(t) is a Dirac delta
function times the viscosity), and S(q) is the static struc-
ture factor. In Eq. (2) f is a Langevin term describing
random forces (see e.g. [18]).

Eq. (2) has been always considered without the de-
terministic forcing term weighted by the electrostrictive
coeﬃcient γe = ρ(∂ǫ/∂ρ)ρ0 [34] , and provides one the
most successful approaches to structural phase transi-
tions of soft-matter. Here we extend it by accounting for
the presence of an external optical ﬁeld [coupled through
Eq. (1)], which induces an electrostrictive force with po-
tential proportional (in conﬁgurational space) to ∇2I.
This model can be thought of as a generalization of the
acoustic wave equation [12], which has been previously
employed to determine the electrostrictive correction to
electronic nonlinearity of silica glass [19]. The latter case
is retrieved in our approach for S(q) = constant and a
memory-less response [i.e. m(t) ∝ δ(t)]. In the general
case considered here, MCT accounts for the elastic defor-
mation of a medium made of interacting particles which
results in a non-homogeneous response weighted by S(q).
Additionally, though here we deal with electrostriction,
MCT is a powerful approach that can be generalized to
account for other types of nonlinearity, e.g.
reorenta-
tional mechanisms, by looking at diﬀerent observables.
As such, it provides a general framework for studying
nonlinear optics in SM, going beyond the idealized Kerr
(local) limit [8, 9] (which is, nevertheless, correctly re-
trieved for non-interacting particles, as shown below). In
the following, we address speciﬁcally the properties of
spatial solitons.

Assuming that the random ﬂuctuations are negligible
with respect to the driving electrostrictive term, the sta-
tionary state solution (∂t = 0) of Eq. (2) yields

typically adopted to modelling inelastic light scattering
spectra (ISTS) [21]. Obviously, in real space, Eq. (3)
corresponds to a diﬀerential equation for ρ = ρ(x, y, z).
While this equation, as well as Eq. (1), involves three
dimensions, OSS imply by deﬁnition a z-independent
intensity. Therefore, in this case, ρ does not depend on
z and Eq. (3), coupled to Eq. (1), will be interpreted
henceforth as a 2D transverse equation with q = (qx, qy)
[35].

Equations (1-3) allow us to develop a general non-
local model for trapping in SM. First we consider the
paraxial (Fresnel) regime, which corresponds to expand-
ing the transverse operator in the q-Fourier transform
k2 − q2 ≃ k[1 − q2/(2k2)]. Equation

(1) becomes,

In Eq. (4) the nonlinearity arises from the term ρE. In-

This limit, however, is well known to lead to unstable
(so-called Townes after Ref. [1]) OSS. Conversely, in the
general case S(q) 6= constant, we expect solutions of Eqs.
(7-8) to be stabilized by non-locality [23, 24, 25, 26, 27].
We are also naturally brought to consider deviation from
paraxiality due to strong focusing, and argue for the ex-
istence of OSS in this case. In fact, narrow OSS in SM
may be important both in speciﬁc applications (e.g. laser
surgery) and in order to establish OSS as a mean for prob-
ing the static structure factor S(q) of SM when the lat-
ter extends to high spatial frequencies. Deviations from
paraxiality can be accounted for by considering the next
order in the expansion of the transverse operator in Eq.
(1). By adopting the normalization employed for the
paraxial case, we cast the new bound state equation in
the form

where the degree of non-paraxialiy is measured by a sin-
gle dimensionless parameter ε = (λ/4πnw0)2 ﬁxed by the
ratio between wavelength λ and beam width scale w0.

In order to discuss various OSS supported by diﬀerent
types of SM, we make speciﬁc examples. We start consid-
ering hard spheres in a host liquid (solvent). In the limit
of diluted, non interacting spheres, S(q) is constant and
this yields, once again, unstable OSS. In a more reﬁned
approximation, S(q) can be described by a parabolic law
in the framework of the Percus-Yevick model [22]

S(q) = S0 + Kq2.

After Eq.
(3), the corresponding expression for ρ (as
stated, we assume ρ to follow adiabatically I along z) is

which, once inserted in Eq. (4), gives a model
weakly non-local solitons that has interdisciplinary inter-
est (plasma physics, matter waves, transport in DNA, see
Ref. [23] and references therein). Stable soliton solutions
of this model have been reported [23] and, in this context,
represent 1+2D OSS in SM, when its static structure fac-
tor can be well approximated by Eq. (11). To this end,
consider that, using Percus-Yevick model, the parabolic
approximation of S(q) breaks down around qrs ∼= 5.

Since q can be reasonably estimated to be q ∼ w
weakly non-local model starts to loose its validity when
the spheres have size comparable with beam width w0 (in
this regime, a microscopic description of the molecular

dynamics is needed). Viceversa, when Eqs. (11-12) hold
valid, the nonlocality that, generally speaking, provides
the stabilizing mechanism of OSS against catastrophic
self-focusing [23] stems from the particle-particle corre-
lation function g(r), which is proportional to the Fourier
transform of S(q) − 1 [22], as anticipated. Importantly,
since S(q) is not uniform, stable OSS not only exist, but
provide information on the material [for a given optical
power, the width of OSS is determined by the constant
K in Eq. (11)].

Further models for S(q) can be discussed. A very in-
triguing case is that in which the suspended particles of
colloidal SM develop self-similar aggregates with fractal
dimension D, described by the function [28]

From Eq. (15) it is readily seen that ρ spatially decays
(when I = 0) as the modiﬁed Bessel function K0 of ar-
gument ξ
D(D + 1)/6σ which depends on the fractal
dimension. Recalling that σ = r/w0 and that the degree
of nonlocality is the ratio between the spatial decay rate
of the optically induced index perturbation and that of
the self-trapped beams, our result implies that the de-
gree of optical non-locality scales basically as the fractal
dimension of the material. Noteworthy, Eqs. (5)-(15) de-
ﬁne another well known model for non-local OSS, which
applies in the case of nematic liquid crystals [29].

In order to show that OSS exist also in the general
case [Eq. (13)], with features directly linked to the fractal
dimension D, we resort to numerical integration of Eqs.
(7-8) [or Eqs. (10-8) in the non-paraxial regime] using
ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization in σ and Newton-Rapson
iterations. To ﬁx the ideas, we show results for the
characteristic values of the following length scale ratios
(between aggregate dimension ξ, particle radius rs, beam
width w0): ξ/rs = 100 and κ = ξ/w0 = 0.1. In Fig. 1
(a) we show existence curves, i.e. the soliton normalized
peak intensity against the normalized soliton width
[max(u2) vs. std of u2 parametrized by β], obtained for
three values of D. As shown the features of OSS change

with fractal dimension D. This is even more clear from
Fig. 1 (b), where we display the OSS normalized power
u2rdr) and width as a function
(i.e. the norm Q = 2π
of the fractal dimension D (here we ﬁx β = 2). In Fig. 2
we show the eﬀect of non-paraxiality. The features of
OSS starts to exhibit signiﬁcant deviations when the
soliton width decreases signiﬁcantly, and non-paraxial
eﬀects are no longer negligible.

It is interesting to observe that for a fractal medium
the equation for ρ in the conﬁgurational space includes
fractional derivatives. Soft matter, not only provide a
un-precedented framework to study nonlocality with a
taylorable structure factor, but also opens the may to
new mathematical models, as we will discuss in future
publications.

To prove that stable self-trapping can be achieved for
input conditions that do not exactly match the OSS pro-
ﬁle, we have run beam propagation simulations for the
paraxial and non-paraxial models. In Fig. 3 we show the
spatial evolution of an input Gaussian TEM00 laser beam
u(σ, ζ = 0) = A exp(−σ2), whose parameters do not ex-
actly match the existence condition. The resulting longi-
tudinal beam oscillations, which depend on beam power
(for a ﬁxed width) and degree of non-paraxiality, have
been reported previously for other non-local solitons [30].
They are connected with the fact that non-local solitons
are absolutely stable, [23] and can be related to excitation
of “internal modes” of the soliton [3, 31], or, in the frame-
work of the hyghly non-local approximation [i.e. when
I(q) varies on a q-scale much broader than that of S(q)]
to the existence of exact breathing solutions [30, 32, 33].
Notably, in the latter regime, ˜I(q) ≃ ˜I(0) ≡ P in Eq.
(3), with P the optical beam power. In this case, Eq. (4)
takes the form of the linear Schr¨odinger equation for a
quantum particle in a 2D potential well with shape dic-
tated by particle autocorrelation g(r) and power P , and
OSS reduce to the bound states, which can be found by
standard techniques. Such results let us envisage a broad
physical setting for the observation of deeply oscillating
nonlocal solitons and show that their existence is not re-
stricted to the paraxial regime,

In summary we have shown that optical beams can
be self-trapped in soft matter both in the paraxial and
tightly focusing regimes, thus opening new perspectives
for their applications in biological materials and as a
mean to probe properties of condensed matter. For ex-
ample, ﬁxing the input beam waist and adjusting the in-
coming power to ﬁnd the appearance of a soliton allows
one to directly measure the fractal dimension of the ag-
gregates. Assessing the role of time dynamics and ther-
mal contributions as well as the validity of the present
approach in other condensed matter systems (e.g., su-
percooled liquids, where optical trapping is unexplored
to date) will be natural extensions of this work.

We acknowledge fruitful discusssions with F. Sciortino,

[34] Speciﬁc expressions for γe follow from the dependence
of the dielectric constant on particle density ǫ(ρ), e.g.
for a suspension of dielectric spheres of radius rs, γe =
ρ04πr3
sǫh(ǫs − ǫh)/(ǫs + 2ǫh), where subscripts h and s
refer to the host medium and the spheres, respectively.

[35] The 2D approach is justiﬁed also for input beams that
do not match exactly the OSS proﬁle, since changes in
z occur usually on a length scale much longer than the
transverse dependence of ρ that yields the trapped state.

We theoretically study reﬂection of light by a phase-conjugating mirror
preceded by a partially reﬂecting normal mirror. The presence of a suitably
chosen normal mirror in front of the phase conjugator is found to greatly
enhance the total phase-conjugate reﬂected power, even up to an order of
magnitude. Required conditions are that the phase-conjugating mirror itself
ampliﬁes upon reﬂection and that constructive interference of light in the
region between the mirrors takes place. We show that the phase-conjugate
reﬂected power then exhibits a maximum as a function of the transmittance
of the normal mirror.

In recent years, the interesting role that phase conjugation can play in mesoscopic physics
has received considerable attention. Phase conjugation is the general term for a process in
which both the direction of propagation and the overall phase factor of a wave function are
reversed [1]. A famous example is Andreev reﬂection [2], the electron-to-hole reﬂection at an
interface between a normal metal and a superconductor in a mesoscopic system. Mesoscopic
means, by deﬁnition, that the dimensions of the system are small enough for phase-coherence
to be preserved in the entire conﬁguration, in this case the normal metal–superconductor
junction, but still much larger than the Fermi wavelength of the normal metal. In this regime
it is interesting to study the inﬂuence of Andreev reﬂection on transport properties such as
the conductance of the sample. The basis of a theoretical approach to this kind of transport
problems was in fact laid as early as 1957 by Landauer, long before the advent of mesoscopic
physics. He related the electrical conductance of a normal metal to its quantum mechanical
transmission matrix, the well-known Landauer formula [3,4]. This reﬂection/transmission
matrix approach turned out to be very useful in mesoscopic transport problems, also in
combination with phase conjugation. For example, Beenakker [5] derived a ”Landauer-
type” formula for the conductance of a normal metal-superconductor junction, which allows
for studying both clean and disordered normal metals in the presence of Andreev reﬂection.
This paper is concerned with the optical counterpart of Andreev reﬂection, namely probe-
to-conjugate reﬂection of light at a phase-conjugating mirror (PCM) [1]. The dimensions of
a PCM are much larger than those of a mesoscopic superconducting system and allow for a
classical treatment of the transport properties of light. Despite this diﬀerent scale, a PCM
system is mesoscopic in the sense that it is larger than the wavelength, but smaller than the
coherence length of the light reﬂecting at it. Electronic and optical phase conjugation display
an interesting analogy [6,7] and also optical phase conjugation can conveniently be described
using a reﬂection/transmission formalism. Recently this was used to study reﬂection of light
at a phase-conjugating mirror behind a disordered optical medium in a waveguide [8].

In view of the time-reversal properties of a phase-conjugating mirror, whereby accumu-
lated phase-shifts are cancelled when the phase-conjugated wave travels back along the path
of the original incoming wave, it is intruiging to combine it with a normal reﬂector. By
normal reﬂector we mean a scattering region in which only specular reﬂections take place,
eg. the disordered medium in [8]. Here we consider the simplest possible normal reﬂector,
a partially transmitting normal mirror. We analyze the phase-conjugate reﬂected power for
plane wave illumination of a conﬁguration consisting of a phase-conjugating mirror preceded
by a partially reﬂecting normal mirror. A lot of work has been done on this kind of resonator
structures involving combinations of normal mirrors and phase-conjugating mirrors [9]. Here
we describe an interesting eﬀect in a normal mirror–phase-conjugating mirror arrangement,
which to our knowledge has been unnoticed so far. When the PCM is operating such that
it ampliﬁes the incoming light upon phase-conjugate reﬂection and multiply reﬂected waves
in the region between the mirrors interfere constructively, we ﬁnd a dramatic enhancement
of the phase-conjugate reﬂected intensity compared with that at the same PCM alone. The
phase-conjugate reﬂectance, deﬁned as the reﬂected power divided by the incident power, is
maximal for a suitably chosen value of the transmittance of the normal mirror and reaches
∼ 10 times its value at the PCM alone.

The phase-conjugating mirror consists of a cell ﬁlled with an optical medium with a large
third-order susceptibility χ(3). The medium is pumped by two intense counterpropagating
laser beams of frequency ω0. When a weak probe beam of frequency ω0 + δ is incident on the
material, a fourth beam will be generated due to the nonlinear polarization of the medium
(four-wave mixing). This so-called conjugate wave propagates with frequency ω0 − δ in the
opposite direction as the probe beam [1]. In the medium, the coupling between probe and
conjugate waves is described by the equations [6]

The one-dimensional system we consider is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. A phase-
conjugating mirror is preceded at distance L by, in general, an elastic scattering region (SR)
which does not couple probe and conjugate waves.

We see that the three middle curves in Fig. 2 display a maximum as a function of T . More
precisely, the maximum in the phase-conjugate reﬂected intensity occurs if Rpcm cos φ ≥ 1

Rc then reaches a value which amounts to several times the phase-conjugate reﬂected inten-
sity at a PCM alone.

Placing a normal mirror in front of a phase-conjugating mirror thus greatly enhances
the phase-conjugate reﬂected intensity, as long as the PCM acts as an ampliﬁer (Rpcm > 1)
and the phase φ is such that cos φ ∼ 1. The maximum occurs because of two competing
eﬀects: on the one hand, the normal mirror causes direct back-reﬂection of part of the
incoming probe wave, so that less light reaches the PCM. On the other hand it opens the
possibility for multiple reﬂections in the region between the two mirrors. For large normal
mirror transmittance the latter eﬀect is dominant, because of the gain in intensity for each
reﬂection at the PCM and the constructive interference of light in the resonator (φ ∼ 2πn).
As T becomes smaller, however, the increasing loss of light through backscattering without
phase-conjugation causes Rc to drop again. The amplifying property of the PCM is essential
for obtaining the maximum. This can easily be seen from (6) which shows that Rc < Rpcm
for Rpcm < 1 [12]. The constructive interference of multiply reﬂected waves is also essential
for obtaining the maximum. Fig. 2 shows that for L = 2 cm (or, equivalently, φ ≈ π/3), Rc
always decreases with T , even though the PCM still acts as an ampliﬁer. The advantage of
additional multiple reﬂections, as the transmittance of the normal mirror becomes less, then
cannot overcome the disadvantage of less primary light arriving at the PCM. Note that a
ﬁnite distance L is not necessary for obtaining the maximum. The curve for L = 0 shows
that a suitably chosen coating on the PCM also gives rise to enhancement of Rc. In this
case the eﬀect is very sensitive to the detuning frequency δ which, as seen from (6) with
L = 0, has to satisfy the condition δ ≪ γ0 in order for φ to be close to zero.

From (6) we see that Rc becomes inﬁnite if cos φ = 1 and T = 1 − 1/Rpcm. This happens
in the upper curve of Fig. 2, for L = 15 cm. It is interesting to compare this with the work of
Paasschens et al. who obtained qualitatively the same divergent behavior in a more complex
system [8]. They studied reﬂection of light at a two-dimensional random medium consisting
of dielectric rods backed by a phase-conjugating mirror. For diﬀusive illumination of the
−1
disordered medium and for δ ≫ τ
dwell, with τdwell the dwell time of a photon in the medium,
interference eﬀects are shown to be negligible. Disregarding angular correlations between
multiply reﬂected waves in the region between the random medium and the PCM then leads
to a phase-conjugate reﬂected power of

Rc =

T 2Rpcm
1 − (1 − T )2R2

.

pcm

(8)

The same expression is obtained when averaging (6) over the phase φ [13]. (8) again shows
the divergence of Rc for T = 1 − 1/Rpcm. As was explained in [8], this is due to some
light becoming trapped in the intermirror region as T decreases. Repetitive reﬂections at
the PCM, provided Rpcm > 1, then lead to the enormous increase in the phase-conjugate
reﬂectance. Since Rc is limited by the intensity of the pump beams, one now needs to take
into account the eﬀects of pump depletion and the analysis breaks down close to and beyond
T = 1 − 1/Rpcm.

The same phenomenon occurs in our one-dimensional system for certain values of L [14].
This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the phase-conjugate reﬂected intensity as a function
of the intermirror distance L for a normal mirror with transmittance of 60 %. The horizontal
line in the ﬁgure indicates the reﬂectance of the PCM alone, Rpcm.

FIG. 3. Phase-conjugate reﬂectance at a normal mirror with transmittance T = 0.6 followed by a
phase-conjugating mirror. Parameters used are Lpcm = 1 cm, δ = 0.1 [c/Lpcm] and γ0 = 1 [c/Lpcm].
The horizontal line marks the phase-conjugate reﬂectance at the PCM alone, Rpcm = 2.4.

It is clear that the presence of the normal mirror at a suitably chosen distance L, such
that φ is close to a multiple of 2π, but suﬃciently far away from it to avoid the eﬀects of
pump depletion, gives a giant enhancement of Rc with respect to Rpcm.

In conclusion, we have theoretically analyzed the phase-conjugate reﬂected power at a
normal mirror followed by a phase-conjugating mirror. For plane wave illumination of this
mirror arrangement, and taking advantage of multiple reﬂection eﬀects in the resonator
region between the mirrors, a giant enhancement of the phase-conjugate reﬂectance is pre-
dicted with respect to that of the PCM alone. Necessary conditions are that reﬂection at the
phase-conjugating mirror is accompagnied by ampliﬁcation, and that constructive interfer-
ence of waves occurs in front of the PCM. If either condition is not satisﬁed, the presence of
the normal mirror only decreases the phase-conjugate reﬂectance. This also happens in the
analogous electronic conﬁguration, a normal metal-superconductor interface preceded by a
normal scattering region: since Andreev reﬂection occurs with at most unity amplitude, the
hole reﬂectance decreases with increasing normal scattering [15].

In previous work on resonators involving a normal mirror and a phase-conjugating mirror
[9] various ways of output power enhancement of the resonator were found. For example,
Pepper et al. [16] reported ampliﬁed phase-conjugate reﬂection using degenerate four-wave
mixing (δ = 0) and a fully reﬂecting normal mirror in combination with a PCM. Under
suitably chosen operating conditions of the PCM they observed a ﬁnite conjugate output
signal in the absence of any input probe signal, the output being directly generated by

6

the pump beams [17]. Feinberg et al. [18] obtained similar self-oscillatory behavior using a
perfectly reﬂecting normal mirror behind a PCM.

Our conﬁguration diﬀers from these resonators, since it gives the phase-conjugate re-
sponse to an input probe signal passed through a partially transmitting normal mirror.
Enhancement of this response occurs both for frequencies δ = 0 (degenerate four-wave mix-
ing) and δ 6= 0 (non-degenerate four-wave mixing), and in a broad range of intermirror
distances L. This allows for frequency discrimination between probe and conjugate output
waves and regularization of the enhancement by choosing an appropriate value of L for ﬁxed
δ, or vice versa.

Finally, as an example, consider a realistic phase-conjugating mirror of length Lpcm =
1 cm, with a coupling strength γ0 = 1010s−1 and illuminated by monochromatic light of
frequency δ ∼ 109s−1 detuned from the pump frequency. The phase-conjugate reﬂectance
Rpcm ∼ 2, which is well within experimental reach [19]. We predict that placing a ≈ 60%
transmitting normal mirror at a distance of L ≈ 14 cm in front of this PCM increases the
phase-conjugate reﬂected power by an order of magnitude and hope that this will present a
challenge to experimentalists.

[10] (4) is the condition for the formation of a bound state in a normal mirror–phase-conjugating
mirror resonator [7]. Due to the coupling of probe and conjugate waves by the PCM, a complete
roundtrip requires four passages through the resonator region (ﬁrst term on right-hand side of
(4)) and two reﬂections at the PCM (second term).

[11] We neglect the diﬀerence in normal-mirror transmission of probe and conjugate waves here,

since δ ≪ ω0.

[12] If reﬂection at the PCM is not accompagnied by ampliﬁcation, enhancement of the phase-
conjugate reﬂectance can be achieved by placing a normal mirror behind the phase-conjugating
mirror and illuminating the PCM with probe light in front. The total phase-conjugate re-
ﬂectance at the PCM then consists of a part resulting from direct phase-conjugate reﬂection
at the PCM plus an extra part as a result of multiple reﬂections in the region between phase-
conjugating mirror and normal mirror.

[13] In performing this average we in fact consider a somewhat hypothetical ”two-dimensional”
system consisting of a sum of N one-dimensional channels (eg. ﬁbres), each containing a
normal mirror, in front of the PCM. If the positions of the normal mirrors in each of these
ﬁbres are random, the accumulated phases φn, n = 1 . . . N will vary uniformly over integral
multiples of 2π for N ≫ 1, and one can average over them.

[14] Notice that the behavior of the phase-conjugate reﬂectance before the enormous increase at
T = 1 − 1/Rpcm is diﬀerent in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional situation. In one
dimension Rc immediately increases as T becomes less than 1 (upper curve in Fig. 2). In two
dimensions it ﬁrst decreases and displays a minimum at T = 1 − 1/R2
pcm [8] as a result of the
diﬀusive illumination and subsequent angular, or phase-shift average.

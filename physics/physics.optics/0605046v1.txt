Abstract

We have developed external-cavity diode lasers, where the wavelength selection is
assured by a low loss interference ﬁlter instead of the common diﬀraction grating.
The ﬁlter allows a linear cavity design reducing the sensitivity of the wavelength
and the external cavity feedback against misalignment. By separating the feedback
and wavelength selection functions, both can be optimized independently leading
to an increased tunability of the laser. The design is employed for the generation of
laser light at 698, 780 and 852 nm. Its characteristics make it a well suited candidate
for space-born lasers.

1 Introduction

Semiconductor lasers have become an inexpensive easy-to-handle source of co-
herent light. Applications in many ﬁelds such as atomic physics, metrology and
telecommunication require single mode operation with narrow linewidth and
good tunability [1]. This is frequently achieved by incorporating the laser diode
into an external cavity where optical feedback and wavelength discrimination
are provided by a diﬀraction grating [2]. However, such a design is sensitive to
the ambient pressure [3] and to optical misalignment [4] induced by mechanical
or thermal deformation. In addition, for the common Littrow conﬁguration,

the direction or position of the output beam depends on the wavelength [5,6].
An alternative design employs a Fabry-P´erot etalon as wavelength discrimi-
nator, operating in transmission [7]. In that case the two tasks of wavelength
selection and feedback reﬂection are carried-out by two diﬀerent optical ele-
ments. The etalon can either be formed from a thin air gap between two glass
plates or a single, thin (∼ 30µm) solid plate. Both solutions are costly, can
be fragile and exhibit multiple resonances. Furthermore, we observe that the
absorption of atmospheric water can shift the transmitted wavelength to the
point of uselessness after two years.

Better robustness and unique transmission is provided by narrow-band dielec-
tric interference ﬁlters. Their use in an extended cavity laser has been demon-
strated for telecom wavelength in [4]. The emission from the anti-reﬂection
coated back facet of a λ = 1300 nm laser diode is fed-back by a ”cat’s eye”
(lens + mirror). An interference ﬁlter of 2 nm passband width and 70 % peak
transmission acts as intra-cavity wavelength discriminator.

Here, we present ﬁlters having 90 % transmission and ∼ 0.3 nm FWHM at
near infra-red and visible wavelengths. The external cavity is added to the
output beam, while the diode’s back facet is coated for high reﬂectivity. The
cavity outcoupler is a partially reﬂecting mirror. Changing its reﬂectivity is
an easy way of optimizing the feed-back. The diode’s output facet has no
particular high-quality anti-reﬂection coating giving rise to a second cavity
formed by the laser chip itself, but making it inexpensive. Chaotic coupling
to adjacent chip modes is eﬃciently suppressed by the narrow bandwidth of
our ﬁlter, up to 8 times the threshold current.

We show that the sensitivity of these lasers to environmental perturbations is
drastically reduced as compared to the Littrow conﬁguration. We demonstrate
tunability over a broader wavelength range thanks to the possibility of opti-
mizing the amount of feedback independently from the wavelength selection
mechanism. We study the lasers’ spectral noise.

2 The external cavity

A schematic of the external cavity is given in Fig. 1. The light emitted from
the diode (DL) is collimated by an objective lens (LC) with short focal length
(3 to 4.5 mm) and high numerical aperture (∼ 0.6). The lens is chosen to com-
pensate for abberations arising from the diode’s packaging window. A partially
reﬂecting mirror, here named out-coupler (OC) provides the feedback into the
diode. The OC is displaced by a piezo-electric transducer (PZT) in order to
vary the cavity length. A narrow-band high-transmission interference ﬁlter
(FI) is introduced into the cavity. The ﬁlter provides the frequency selectivity

usually obtained by replacing the out-coupler with a diﬀraction grating. With
this set-up, we are able to achieve single-mode, tunable operation. In addition
much better stability against optical misalignment is achieved by focussing
the collimated beam in a ”cat’s eye” onto the out-coupler. We typically em-
ploy a lens (L1) of 18 mm focal length. A second, similar lens (L2) provides a
collimated output beam. Contrary to the Littrow laser design, reﬂection and
wavelength discrimination are provided by two diﬀerent elements so that the
amount of feedback can easily be optimized.

In Fig. 1 the diode’s back facet is coated for high reﬂection. Alternatively, this
facet can have low reﬂection to provide the output beam. In that case one
chooses OC with maximum reﬂectivity.

3 Tunability and wavelength sensitivity

For a Littrow laser wavelength discrimination is given by the Bragg condition
λ = 2d sin θ where d is the grating’s line spacing and θ the angle of incidence.
For wavelengths in the near infra-red, typical values are d−1 = 1200 lines/mm
and θ = 30◦. This leads to dλ/dθ ≈ 1.4 nm/mrad. Tuning the laser redirects
the output beam by 2(dλ/dθ)−1 ≈ 1.4 mrad/nm or, if a mirror is attached to
the grating mount[6], leads to a transverse displacement of dx/dλ = 18 µm/nm
(assuming a distance of 15 mm between the grating and the mirror).

Wavelength discrimination of our ﬁlter is based on multiple reﬂection within
its dielectric coatings and behaves as a thin Fabry-P´erot etalon with eﬀective
index of refraction nef f . The transmitted wavelength is given by

λ = λmaxv
u
u
t
where θ is again the angle of incidence. λmax is the wavelength at normal
incidence. A typical value is nef f = 2 (see section 5). We choose the nominal
wavelength to be transmitted at 6◦ of incidence which, for λmax = 853 nm

This is 60 times smaller than for the Littrow conﬁguration. The corresponding
reduction of the sensitivity of the wavelength against mechanical instabilities
is a clear advantage of our design. Note that this reduction is not achieved at
the expense of a reduced tunability (see section 7). Tuning the ﬁlter displaces
the output beam by

= 8 µm/nm,

due to the 0.5 mm thick fused-silica ﬁlter substrate (n ∼ 1.45). This is two
times smaller than for the modiﬁed Littrow laser. Note that if one chooses to
out-couple from the diode’s back facet, the displacement is further reduced.

4 Sensitivity of the optical feedback

We now study the sensitivity of the laser to a misalignment of the external cav-
ity that does not aﬀect the emission wavelength but the optical feedback. We
consider a Gaussian beam with electric ﬁeld Edo being emitted from the output
facet of the diode (z = 0). Its propagation through the external cavity (along z)
can be modeled in the paraxial approximation giving the reﬂected electric ﬁeld
Edr at the output facet of the diode. The feedback F = R−1|
doEdrdxdy|2
is given by the overlap integral of the reﬂected and emitted electric ﬁelds.
For convenience we normalize by the reﬂectivity R of the grating/out-coupler.
The variation of F under misalignment reﬂects the mechanical and thermal
sensitivity of the laser.

E∗

RR

Two sources of misalignment are considered: tilt of the out-coupler (grating)
and axial displacement of the out-coupler. Displacements of other optical ele-
ments can be transformed into one of these. The computation of F turns out
to be independent of the number of lenses in the cavity, and can be simpliﬁed
by calculating the overlap integral F = R−1|
reiErerdxdy|2 at the position
z = zre of the reﬂective element [4]. Here Erei and Erer are respectively the
incident and reﬂected electric ﬁelds on the out-coupler. We assume that the
incident beam is perfectly aligned so that it forms a waist of 1/e2 radius w0
on the out-coupler.

If α is the angle formed by the incident and reﬂected beam due to a small tilt
of the out-coupler, we ﬁnd [4]

Note that ξ = λ/(πw0) is the 1/e divergence angle.

On the other hand, if the reﬂective element is displaced along the optical axis

Equations 5 and 7 show that w0 is the only parameter which determines the
sensitivity of the optical feedback to misalignment. In grating-tuned extended
cavity lasers, the beam waist is essentially determined by the selectivity re-
quirement and is of the order of 1 mm. This leads to a rather poor trade-oﬀ
between angular and displacement sensitivity. Indeed, a tilt of the grating of
α = 100 µrad is suﬃcient to decrease the coupling factor F by 10 %, while a
similar reduction due to a pure displacement would correspond to δ = 1 m. In
the new scheme described here the separation of the wavelength selection and
optical feedback allows to choose a more favorable value for w0. In our cat’s
eye setup w0 ∼ 10 µm. Hence, the tilt or displacement reducing F by 10 %
(α = 9 mrad or δ = 0.1 mm respectively) are both very large deformations.

5 The ﬁlter

The interference ﬁlter [8] is formed of a series of dielectric coatings on an opti-
cal substrate with anti-reﬂection coated back face. It is calculated to transmit
more than 90 % of the intensity at the nominal wavelength at 6◦ incidence.
The fullwidth at half maximum (FWHM) of the transmission curve is chosen
as 0.3 nm, which is about twice the mode spacing of a typical laser diode.
Filters with even higher ﬁnesse can be produced only at the cost of reduced
transmission. The chosen compromise turns out to provide suﬃcient discrimi-
nation for stable single mode lasing with satisfactory output power (see section
6).

The samples tested here are fabricated on larger optical wafers and then cut
into pieces of 5 × 5 mm2, thereby reducing the production costs. We test
several fabrication batches at 698, 780 and 852 nm nominal wavelength. In the

5

following the measurements on a 852 nm ﬁlter are described. Similar results
are obtained for the other wavelengths.

The transmission of a 1.2 mm diameter collimated beam of known wavelength
is measured. Fig. 2 shows the results as a function of the angle of incidence for
a 852.1 nm beam (•) and a 843.9 nm beam (◦). The ﬁrst maximum has 89 %
transmission at θ = 6.96(4)◦ and a FWHM of 0.80(1)◦. The 843.9 nm light is
transmitted to 84 % at θ = 17.34◦ with a FWHM of 0.40◦. Using equation 1
we ﬁt λmax = 853.7 nm and nef f = 1.97. This leads to ∆λF W HM = 0.37 nm
for 852 nm and ∆λF W HM = 0.44 nm for 844 nm. The transmission peaks are
well ﬁtted by a Lorentzian taking the wavelength as argument. If the ﬁlter is
used at a wavelength 8 nm below its nominal value the transmission drops by
5 % only. Repeating the measurement on 6 diﬀerent production batches, we
ﬁnd less than 5 % variation of the maximum transmission at 852.1 nm.

In a second set of measurements, the transmission at 852.1 nm is determined
as a function of the incident polarization. A sinusoidal variation from 89 % to
75 % is observed when the linear polarization rotates from parallel to perpen-
dicular with respect to the axis of inclination.

Thirdly, the transmission is analyzed as a function of the position on the ﬁlter
(Fig. 3). A 0.5 mm wide slit is placed in the 852.1 nm beam. Having optimized
the angle of incidence at the center and keeping it ﬁxed (◦), the right half of the
ﬁlter shows good homogeneous transmission, whereas the transmission drops
drastically towards the left edge. When the angle of incidence is optimized
at each position (•), the transmission can be recovered to > 70 %. The
corresponding angle at the left edge is 0.6 mrad bigger than the optimum
angle at the center. Fig. 3 represents a batch with good spatial homogeneity.
Stronger variations are observed for other samples. This result indicates that
smaller beam diameters (< 1 mm) are favorable.

Finally we test the ﬁlters under vacuum. At a residual pressure of 10−4 Pa,
we do not observe any variation of the optimal angle of transmission com-
pared to atmospheric pressure to within our experimental resolution (5 GHz
when expressed in terms of frequency). To ensure that desorption of residual
gas from the coatings does not inﬂuence this result, the vacuum is kept over
one month. This makes the ﬁlter a perfectly suited candidate for wavelength
selection in space-born lasers.

6 A prototype emitting at 852 nm

Following the design of Fig. 1, a laser at 852 nm is built. The diode (SDL
5422) nominally emits 150 mW for a current of I = 150 mA at 854 nm.

The output facet coating is speciﬁed to induce less than 4 % reﬂection. We
measure the free spectral range of the naked diode as ∼ 50 GHz (0.13 nm),
which corresponds to a physical length of ∼ 0.8 mm assuming the index of
refraction of GaAs (n = 3.6) [9].

and anti-reﬂection on the outer. It is glued onto a 10 mm diameter PZT tube
of 1 mm wall thickness and 10 mm length. The overall length of the external
cavity is 70 mm.

Diﬀerent reﬂection coeﬃcients of the OC are tried. The output power at I =
85 mA is 47, 40 and 30 mW for 15, 20 and 30 % reﬂectivity, respectively. At 15
and 20 % reﬂection, single mode operation is obtained for certain intervals of
the diode current only. At 30 % reﬂection stable single mode lasing is assured
from the threshold current (∼ 10 mA) to 8 times its value. Operation on
the same diode mode is assured within a span of 4 mrad of ﬁlter inclination
(44 GHz), before an adjacent mode of the diode is selected. This demonstrates
the small sensitivity of our design to a tilt of the selective element (equation
2).

In order to determine the laser’s spectral properties, we measure the beat
signal between two identical set-ups separated in frequency by ν0 = 8.75 GHz.
The observed spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst laser is locked to the D2
line of Cs. The second one is locked (with a bandwidth of 15 kHz) to the ﬁrst
one so that the beat frequency stays constant. The remaining higher frequency
noise leads to a random distribution of the central beat frequency, which is

8

well ﬁtted by a Gaussian (solid line). We ﬁt the points within ±0.5 MHz from
the center and ﬁnd a FWHM of 155 kHz. The wings (|ν − ν0| > 1 MHz) of
the beat signal can be ﬁtted by a Lorentzian (dashed line) giving the high
frequency noise of the laser. Its FWHM of 28 kHz indicates that the white
noise level of each laser corresponds to a linewidth of 14 kHz. An even smaller
white noise ﬂoor may be obtained by means of stronger optical feedback or a
longer external cavity.

Because of the ﬁlter’s vacuum compatibility and the mechanical stability of
our prototype, the design of Fig. 1 has been selected for the construction
of space-qualiﬁed lasers for the PHARAO project [10]. Space qualiﬁcation in-
cludes survival in vibratory environments with sinusoidal excitation (30 Hz)
at a level of ±35 g during 120 s and random excitation (20-600 Hz) with a
level of 31 g rms during 120 s. The qualiﬁcation model has passed the vibra-
tion tests. Its spectral characteristics did not change and the output beam
mis-orientation remained below 10 µrad.

Using a Sharp diode (GH0781JA2C) and a 780 nm ﬁlter in a similar external
cavity we generate laser light for the manipulation of atomic rubidium.

7 A prototype emitting at 698 nm

Similar components are used to build a laser at 698 nm with a 100 mm long
external cavity. A CircuLaser diode (PS 107) speciﬁed at 688 nm is used. Its
free running output power is 30 mW for I = 100 mA at room temperature.
The interference ﬁlter used here is speciﬁed for 698 nm at 6◦ of incidence. The
measured optimal incidence is 9◦. By varying the inclination of the ﬁlter, the
temperature of the diode and the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the OC, we achieve
lasing from 679 nm to 700 nm with the same non AR-coated diode. Emission
at 679 nm is easily obtained by using a 40 % reﬂection OC and cooling the
diode to 19◦C. The output power is 4 mW, for I = 60 mA. Even smaller
wavelengths seem reachable, only limited by the size of the ﬁlter mount. It is
more diﬃcult to reach 698 nm, as this wavelength lies at the very edge of the
diode’s gain curve. We heat the diode to 40◦ C. 60 % reﬂectivity of the OC
gives stable single mode lasing but limited output power. 50 % reﬂection leads
to an output power of 2 mW at I = 57 mA with suﬃcient mode selection. No
emission at 698 nm is observed for 40 % reﬂection. Finally, due to operation
at the very edge of the gain curve, the possibility to tune the laser by varying
the current of the diode laser is limited to 40 GHz, as compared to 70 GHz if
the diode is emitting at its nominal wavelength.

The tunability of this laser is signiﬁcantly larger than we had formerly achieved
with grating feedback. This may be due to the fact that the coupling of the

diode to the external cavity is more easily optimized with the design of ﬁgure 1.
In addition, the grating induces aberrations which are diﬃcult to compensate
for. Being able to pull the diodes more than 10 nm away from their nominal
wavelength is another advantage of the new setup, especially in spectral regions
where laser diodes are not available, like 700 nm.

We measure the frequency noise of the interference ﬁlter laser against a 400
mm long Fabry-P´erot cavity of ﬁnesse 300. Both, the laser and the cavity are
free running. The observed frequency noise power spectral density Sν,L(ν) is
plotted in Fig. 5. From 2 Hz to 300 kHz, Sν,L(ν) essentially decreases with 1/ν
corresponding to ﬂicker frequency noise. Peaks due to acoustic perturbations
are also observed for Fourier frequencies between 100 Hz and 2 kHz. From Fig.
5 we can deduce the fast linewidth ∆νL of the laser using [11]

8 Conclusion

We have built external cavity diode lasers using an interference ﬁlter as wave-
length selective element. The ﬁlter presents high transmission and narrow
bandwidth. The cavity design drastically improves the laser’s passive stability
and reduces beam walk when tuned. The amount of feedback can easily be

varied by the reﬂectivity of the out-coupler. Prototypes at diﬀerent wavelength
in the visible and near infra-red were realized showing a linewidth down to
14 kHz. Tuning over 20 nm was demonstrated. The prototypes are currently
employed in atomic physics experiments on Cs, Rb and Sr, e.g. for laser cool-
ing.

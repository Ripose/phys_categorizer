Abstract
This is the second paper in a series on light scattering from optically anisotropic scatterers
embedded in an isotropic medium. The apparently complex T-matrix theory involving mixing
of angular momentum components turns out to be an eﬃcient approach to calculating scattering
in these systems. We present preliminary results of numerical calculations of the scattering by
spherical droplets in some simple cases. The droplets contain optically anisotropic material with
local radial or uniform anisotropy. We concentrate on cases in which the scattering is due only
to the local optical anisotropy within the scatterer. For radial anisotropy we ﬁnd non-monotonic
dependence of the scattering cross-section on the degree of anisotropy can occur in a regime for
which both the Rayleigh and semi-classical theories are inapplicable. For uniform anisotropy the
cross-section is strongly dependent on the angle between the incident light and the optical axis,
and for larger droplets this dependence is non-monotonic.

INTRODUCTION

In the ﬁrst paper in this series [1], we developed a T -matrix theory of light scattering by
spherical but optically anisotropic – either radially or uniformly – scatterers. Whereas for
radial anisotropic scatterers it is possible to derive closed form expressions for the elements of
the T-matrix, in the uniformly anisotropic case this is no longer true. To further complicate
matters, in this latter case the T –matrix elements can only be derived numerically by
inverting a rather diﬃcult set of matrix equations. Because the spherical symmetry of a
usual scattering problem is reduced in this case to cylindrical symmetry, the scattering
involves angular momentum mixing. The consequence is that the set of equations to be
inverted is in principle inﬁnite in number.

In this paper we continue this study. We ﬁnd that notwithstanding the daunting nature
of the formal structure of the T –matrix theory, in fact this theory provides a viable and
eﬃcient strategy for calculating the elements of the T –matrix, and thus computing the
scattering properties of these objects. Throughout this paper we shall refer to the ﬁrst
paper in this series as I, and write Eq. (n) of I as Eq. (n.I).

A number of approaches are available to study light scattering by complex objects. A brief
summary is as follows. The scattering amplitudes can be described using Green’s function
techniques [2], but these involve solving complex integral equations over inﬁnite domains.
Under some circumstances one can approximate the kernels of these equations either as the
incident wave or as a semi-classical perturbed wave, leading to the well-known Rayleigh-
Gans (R-G) and Anomalous Diﬀraction Approximations (ADA). These have been used by
ˇZumer and coworkers to examine the problems we consider in this paper [3, 4]. However,
the approximations are only valid over certain wavelength and optical contrast regimes.
The century-old Mie strategy and its modern T –matrix extensions yield exact solutions,
but unfortunately this approach does not work in every case. Finally one can of course
use real space ﬁnite element approaches, but these are notoriously ineﬃcient at reproducing
known solutions. For a more comprehensive review we refer the reader to Chap. 2 in [5] and
references therein.

The T -matrix theory is known to be a computationally eﬃcient approach to study light
scattering by nonspherical optically isotropic particles [5]. One may thus expect that a
T –matrix approach to geometrically spherical but optically non-spherical scatterers can at
the very least enable scattering properties to be evaluated when the approximate methods
cannot be applied. In addition, whereas the region of validity of the approximate methods
such as R-G and ADA in the case of isotropic scatterers is reasonably well-understood, in
the case of anisotropic scatterers this problem has not been been studied in any detail.

In I we have discussed composite spherical scatterers, consisting of a central isotropic
core plus a surrounding annular layer in which the optical tensor is anisotropic: ǫij =
ǫ⊥[δij +u(ˆn
ǫ⊥)/ǫ⊥ is the anisotropy parameter. For radial anisotropy
the optical axis, ˆn, is directed along the radius vector, ˆn = ˆr, and for the uniform anisotropy
the optical axis is parallel to the z-axis, ˆn = ˆz. These cases present diﬀerent mathematical
challenges to the theorist.

ˆn)ij], where u = (ǫk −

⊗

Light scattering from the radially anisotropic annular layer was ﬁrst studied long ago
In
by Roth and Digman [6] using the technique normally known as Debye potentials.
an earlier paper [7] we have recovered this solution as a special case of a more general
set of anisotropies. A crucial step in the derivation of this result involves writing the so-
called modiﬁed T -matrix ansatz (see Eqs. (26.I)-(27.I)). The spherical symmetry of the

2

scatterer requires the modes (27.I) entering the ansatz (26.I) to be proportional to the
corresponding vector spherical harmonics. As a result the scattering does not mix diﬀerent
angular momenta. The T –matrix is then diagonal over the angular momentum indices and
the azimuthal numbers and the elements of the T -matrix are expressible in closed form (see
Sec. IV.A of I).

The uniform anisotropy case is much more diﬃcult. The light scattering problem for a
uniformly anisotropic spherical scatterer is not exactly solvable [8]. As an alternative, it has
been studied by using R-G and ADA [3, 4].

In I we approached this problem by formulating it as a suitably modiﬁed T -matrix
theory.
It is necessary to relate the plane wave packet representation to expansions of
electromagnetic ﬁelds over vector spherical harmonics. The net result is to deﬁne a set of
wave functions representing exact solutions of Maxwell’s equations in an anisotropic layer
that are at the same time deformed spherical harmonics. The coeﬃcient functions that
enter the expressions for these wave functions describe angular momentum mixing and are
computationally accessible.

In this paper we ﬁnd numerical results for the total scattering cross-section in the limiting
case of a droplet, i.e. when the radius of the isotropic core of the scatterer, R2, is negligible
(R2 →
0). The scattering by a droplet presents fewer technical diﬃculties than scattering
by the annular layer which was our principal focus in I. Anisotropy eﬀects are our primary
concern and for this reason we pay special attention to the case where the scattering can
be solely attributed to the presence of the anisotropy. Speciﬁcally, in our subsequent cal-
culations we consider the special case for which the ordinary wave refractive index and the
refractive index of the material are matched, n = no or ǫ = ǫ⊥.

The paper is organised as follows.

In Sec. II we use the general T -matrix formalism
developed in I to write down some necessary formulae relevant to the special case of droplets.
In Sec. III we make brief comments on the numerical strategy and present some numerical
results. Finally in Sec. IV we make some brief concluding remarks.

II. T -MATRIX CALCULATIONS FOR DROPLETS

A. Notation

In this section we adapt the key theoretical relations derived in I so that they can be
used in the case of droplets. In addition, we rewrite the expressions for the total scattering
cross-section in a more convenient form.

We ﬁrst introduce some notation. Radially anisotropic droplets present an isotropic face
to the world, to the extent that the scattering properties are independent of the the direction
of the incident wave. In the case of the uniformly anisotropic droplets, this is no longer true.
In this case the scattering geometry is shown in Fig. 1. The angle of incidence θinc is the
angle between the direction of incidence ˆk and the direction of the uniform anisotropy.
The y direction is perpendicular to the plane made from these two directions. We shall
show explicitly that the scattering process does not involve the y-component, E(inc)
, of the
incoming plane wave

These are the equivalent of the equations (51.I) for scattering by a spherical annulus. The
equations are considerably simpler, as a result of what might be called mode decoupling.
The crucial point is that the normal modes inside the droplet are all regular at the origin,
and thus two types of modes which appear in the case of the annulus do not appear here.
This reduces the number of variables in the problem by one half, even in the case of the
uniform anisotropy which, at least in principle, presented a certain number of problems in
the annular case.

From Eq. (8) we can immediately derive an expression for the T -matrix:

Note that for radial anisotropy Qαβ = δαβ Q. By contrast,
in the case of uniformly
anisotropic droplet we have rather strong dependence of the scattering eﬃciency on the
polarisation of the incoming wave. When the refractive indices are matched, n = no, it is
expected that the scatterer does not change the y component of the incident wave, which
simply transforms into the ordinary wave inside the droplet without being aﬀected by the
scattering process. The algebraic interpretation of this fact is that the amplitudes of the
scattered wave β(sca)
jm; y are equal to zero. However, it is not straightforward to
see that the system (8) is consistent with this conclusion. We show this in Appendix A;
the proof involves using relations (46.I) in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds inside the

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we present numerical results for the scattering eﬃciency deﬁned by
Eqs. (14) and (15). We are primarily interested in anisotropy-induced scattering.
In or-
der to concentrate on this test case, we consider the case when the refractive indices n and
no are equal. We shall present a more comprehensive analysis of all possible cases, including
the results for the angular distribution of the scattered waves, elsewhere. We begin with brief
comments on numerical procedure and then proceed with the description of the calculated
dependencies.

It is rather straightforward to perform computations for radially anisotropic droplets.
The expressions for the elements of T -matrix are known and given by Eqs. (11a)-(11b). We
can thus evaluate the scattering eﬃciency by explicitly computing the sum in the expres-
sion (22.I).

For uniformly anisotropic droplets T -matrix can only be computed numerically by solving

the system of equations (8) [10]. Some highlights of the results are presented below.

The dependence of the scattering eﬃciency on the angle of incidence is shown in Fig. 2.

Scattering eﬃciencies of radially and uniformly anisotropic droplets versus the size

If the size parameter, kR1, is not very large, the scattering eﬃciency Qxx is a monotonically
increasing function of the angle of incidence, θinc, in the region from 0 to π/2. By symmetry
Qxx(θinc) = Qxx(π/2
θinc), and so the scattering eﬃciency decreases in the range from π/2
to π.

−

In Fig. 3 we show what happens for shorter wavelength and thus higher values of kR1.
Now, for for relatively large values of the size parameter, the cross-section dependence on
the angle is incidence is no longer monotonic. For example, at kR1 = 20.0, the angle at
which the scattering eﬃciency Qxx reaches its maximum value is no longer at π/2.

Fig. 4 shows the scattering eﬃciencies Qxx(π/2) (for uniform anisotropy) and Q (for radial
anisotropy) versus the size parameter. The scattering eﬃciency of uniformly anisotropic
10.0 and exhibits strongly non-
droplet has a pronounced peak located at about kR1 ≈
monotonic behaviour. By contrast, the corresponding dependence for the radially anisotropic
20.0,
droplet is monotonically increasing. In this case the ﬁrst maximum is reached at kR1 ≈
outside the range of kR1 shown in Fig. 4.

The scattering eﬃciencies as a function of the anisotropy parameter, 0

diﬀerent values of the size parameter are plotted in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for the cases of radial
and uniform anisotropies respectively. In both cases an increase in the size parameter leads
to the appearance of peaks in this range of u. As compared to radially anisotropic scatterers,

in the anisotropy parameters .

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work we have described some of the numerical results calculated using the T -
matrix theory developed in paper I. In particular, we have studied the scattering eﬃciency
of radially and uniformly anisotropic droplets in which the ordinary refractive index matches
the refractive index of the material surrounding them.

The assumption in which the ordinary refractive index of the droplet matches the isotropic
dielectric constant in the surrounding medium is not taken in order to simplify the numerical
treatment. Rather in this paper we wish to study the light scattering properties which can be
solely attributed to the anisotropic part of the dielectric tensor. Thus we have the anisotropy
eﬀects separated out to concentrate on diﬀerences between isotropic and anisotropic optical
axis distributions.

Clearly, the diﬀerence in symmetry causes the most crucial diﬀerences in the light scat-
tering. For uniformly anisotropic droplets the scattering eﬃciency depends on the angle of
incidence and the polarisation of incoming wave, whereas for radially anisotropic scatterers

it does not. In other words, the scattering from radially anisotropic droplet shares some
features of isotropic scatterers.

Nevertheless, the angular dependencies for the scattered wave intensity and the depolar-

isation factor shown at the end of I clearly indicate the pronounced diﬀerences.

The graphs plotted in Figs. 4-6 indicate that uniformly anisotropic droplets are more sen-
sitive to changes in the wavelength and anisotropy parameters than are radially anisotropic
droplets. Our results are also consistent with results of previous studies [4, 7] that the inter-
nal spatial distribution of the optical axis is a factor which strongly aﬀects light scattering
from anisotropic scatterers.

The results of this work can be regarded as the ﬁrst step towards more comprehensive
study of light scattering by anisotropic scatterers. We have demonstrated that the T -matrix
approach developed in I can be used in an eﬃcient numerical treatment of the scattering
problem.
It is thus reasonable to expect that further progress can be made by applying
this theory to more complex problems involving light scattering by optical anisotropic liquid
crystalline systems and other related problems, as discussed further in the last section of I.

APPENDIX A

In this appendix we show mathematically, suing our formalism, the physically obvious
result that if the ordinary refractive index of a droplet matches that of the scattering medium,
then there will be no scattering of the polarisation component out of the plane of the incident
wave and the uniform anisotropy in the droplet. In order to do this, we ﬁrst extend algebraic
relations that follow from Eqs. (46.I). These equations give the expansion of plane wave
propagating in a uniformly anisotropic medium. We can rewrite them for the plane wave
inside the droplet:

It is seen that the elements of the column on the right hand side of this equation are the sums
from the left hand sides of Eqs. (A3) and (A4). On the other hand, from Eqs. (A1)-(A2), the
square bracketed sums on the right hand sides of Eqs. (A3)-(A4) are the plane waves. So,
the elements of the column (A5) can be evaluated as scalar products of the vector spherical
functions and the vector plane waves by using Eqs. (B6.I) and (B8.I) of appendix B in I.

We can now apply this procedure to calculate the elements of the column (A5) for the ordi-

[10] These computations have been performed by using the NAG FORTRAN library at the Uni-
versity of Southampton. The library was employed to calculate special functions, evaluate in-
tegrals and inverse matrices. In order to have the relative error well below 0.1%, the program
was designed to take into account suﬃciently large amount of contributions to the scattering
eﬃciency that come from diﬀerent angular momenta and azimuthal numbers. The detailed
description of the program is beyond the scope of this paper. The code is available on request
by e-mail from either of the authors.

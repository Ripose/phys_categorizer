The physical origin of the Fresnel drag of light by a moving dielectric medium

Institut f¨ur Experimentalphysik, Karl Franzens Universit¨at Graz, Universit¨atsplatz 5 A-8010 Graz, Austria

We present a new derivation of the Fresnel-Fizeau formula for the drag of light by a moving
medium using a simple perturbation approach. We focus particulary on the physical origin of the
phenomenon and we show that it is very similar to the Doppler-Fizeau eﬀect. We prove that this
eﬀect is, in its essential part, independent of the theory of relativity. The possibility of applications
in other domains of physics is considered.

INTRODUCTION

It is usual to consider the famous experiment of Fizeau
(1851)1 on the drag of light by a uniformly moving
medium as one of the crucial experiments which, just
as the Michelson-Morley experiment, cannot be correctly
understood without profound modiﬁcation of Newtonian
space-time concepts (for a review of Einstein’s relativity
as well as a discussion of several experiments the reader
is invited to consult2,3,4). The result of this experiment
which was predicted by Fresnel5, in the context of elas-
tic theory, is indeed completely justiﬁed by well known
arguments due to von Laue (1907)6. He deduced the
Fresnel-Fizeau result for the light velocity v in a medium,
corresponding to a relativistic ﬁrst order expansion of the
Einstein velocity transformation formula:

Here, n0 represents the optical index of refraction of the
dielectric medium in its proper frame, and we suppose
that the uniform medium motion with velocity ve is par-
allel to the path of the light and oriented in the same
direction of propagation. In the context of electromag-
netic theory7,8 all derivations of this eﬀect are ﬁnally
based on the invariance property of the wave operator
∂µ∂µ[...] in a Lorentz transformation. It is easy to write

[∂µ∂µ +
ertial frames and which for a plane waves, implies the
result of Eq. 1. In this calculation we obtain the result
v = c/n0 +ve if we use the Galilean transformation which
proves the insuﬃciency of Newtonian dynamics.
However, the question of the physical meaning of this
phenomenon is not completely clear. This fact is in part
due to the existence of a derivation made by Lorentz
(1895)9 based on the mixing between the macroscopic
Maxwell’s equations and a microscopic electronic oscil-
lator model which is classical in the sense of the New-
tonian dynamics. In his derivation Lorentz did not use
the relativistic transformation between the two coordi-
nate frames:
laboratory and moving medium. Conse-
quently, the relativistic nature of the reasoning does not

(cid:1)

appear explicitly. Following the point of view of Ein-
stein (1915)10 the Lorentz demonstration must contain
an implicit hypothesis of relativistic nature, however, this
point has not been studied in the literature. Recent de-
velopments in optics of moving media11,12,13,14 allows us
to consider this question as an important one to under-
stand the relation between optics, relativity and new-
tonian dynamics. This constitutes the subject of the
present paper. Here, we want to analyze the physical
origin of the Fresnel-Fizeau eﬀect. In particular we want
to show that this phenomenon is, in its major part, in-
dependent of relativistic dynamics.
The paper
In section
II we present the generalized Lorentz “microscopic-
macroscopic” derivation of the Fresnel formula and the
principal defect of this treatment. In section III we show
how to derive the Fresnel result in a perturbation ap-
proach based on the Lorentz oscillator model and ﬁnally
in IV we justify this eﬀect independently from all phys-
ical assumptions concerning the electronic structure of
matter.

II. THE LORENTZ ELECTRONIC MODEL AND
ITS GENERALIZATION

In this part, we are going to describe the essential con-
tents of the Lorentz model and of its relativistic exten-
sion. Let ξ (x, t) be the displacement of an electron from
its equilibrium position at rest, written as an explicit
function of the atomic position x and of the time t. In
the continuum approximation we can write the equation
of motion for the oscillator as ∂2

≃
E0e−i(ωt−k·x) where the supposed harmonic electric
−
incident ﬁeld appears and where the assumption of small
velocity allows us to neglect the magnetic force term. In
the case of a non relativistic uniformly moving medium

The diﬃculty of the preceding model

is that the
Lorentz derivation does not clarify the meaning of the
Fresnel-Fizeau phenomenon.
Indeed we justify Eq. 1
using a microscopical model which is in perfect agree-
ment with the principle of relativity. However we observe
c the use of the non relativistic
that at the limit ve ≪
dynamics of Newton (see Eq. 2) gives the same result.
More precisely one can see from Eq. 2 that the intro-
B/c in addition to
duction of the magnetic force
the electric force is already suﬃcient to account for the
Fresnel-Fizeau eﬀect and this even if the classical force
formula F = m¨x(t) is conserved. Since the electromag-
netic force contains the ratio ve/c and originates from
Maxwell’s equations this is already a term of relativistic

We can obtain this result more rigorously by using
Maxwell’s boundary conditions at the two moving inter-
faces separating the matter of the slab and the air (see

In order to evaluate the diﬀracted ﬁeld which is Eafter−
Ebefore we can limit our calculation to a ﬁrst order ap-
proximation. Thereby, each dipole of the Lorentz model
as discussed above can be considered as being excited di-
rectly by the incident electromagnetic wave and where we
can neglect all phenomena implying multiple interactions
between light and matter. In this limit Eq. 11 reduces to

nature (Einstein used indeed this fact to modify the dy-
namical laws of Newton15). The derivation of Lorentz is
then based on Newton as well as on Einstein dynamics.
It is well know in counterpart that the Doppler-Fizeau
eﬀect, which includes the same factor 1
ve/c, can be
understood without introducing Einstein’s relativity. In-
deed this eﬀect is just a consequence of the invariance of
the phase associated with a plane wave when we apply
a Galilean transformation (see2, Chap. 11) as well as a
Lorentz transformation. We must then analyze further
in detail the interaction of a plane wave with a moving
dipole in order to see if the Fresnel phenomenon can be
understood independently of the speciﬁc Lorentz dynam-
ics.
We consider in this part a diﬀerent calculation based on a
perturbation method and inspired by a derivation of the
optical theorem by Feynman16,17. Consider a thin slab
of thickness L perpendicular to the x axis. Let this slab
move along the positive x direction with the constant ve-
locity ve ˆex. Let in addition E0e−iω(t−x/c) be the incident
electric ﬁeld of a plane wave which pursues the moving
slab (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the electric ﬁeld after the
slab can be formally written as

the travel time of the light through the slab as ∆τ0 =

If we call δt0 the time during which the energy contained
in a plane of light moving in the positive x direction is
absorbed by the slab at rest in the laboratory, δt0γe is
evidently the enlarged time for the moving case. During
the period where this plane of light is absorbed by the
slab its energy moves at the velocity ve. This fact can be
directly deduced of the energy and momentum conserva-
tion laws. Indeed, let M γeve be the momentum of the
slab of mass M before the collision and ǫ the energy of
the plane of light, then during the interaction the slab is
in a excited state and its energy is now E∗ = ǫ + M γec2
and its momentum P ∗ = ǫ/c + M γeve. The velocity of
the excited slab is deﬁned by w = c2P ∗/E∗ and we can
see that in the approximation M

the interaction with the slab has the form

where ∆ω is a small interval centered on ωm, then after
the interaction we must have:

Eafter (x, t) =

dωaωei(kx−ω[t−δt(ω)),

where δt (ω) is given by Eq. 13. After some manipula-
tion we can write these two wave packets in the usual
approximative form:

(32)

Here, vg = ∂ωm/∂km = c is the group velocity of the
pulse in vacuum and δtg = ∂ (ωmδt (ωm)) /∂ωm is the
perturbation time associated with this group motion.
This equation for F possesses the same form as Eq. 11
and then the same analogy which implies Eq. 25 is pos-
sible. This can be seen from the fact that we have

δt (ω) = γeδt0(ω′) (1

It is important to remark that all this reasoning con-
serves its validity if we put γe = 1 and if we think only in
the context of Newtonian dynamics. Since the reasoning
with the travel time does not explicitly use the structure
of the medium involved (and no more the magnetic force

This last equation give us the Fresnel result if we put the
eﬀective sound index n0 = 1+cδt0/L. We can control the
self consistency of this calculation by observing that the
dispersion relation Eq. 35 allows the deﬁnition of a phase

This reveals a perfect analogy between the sound wave

ing that the Fresnel result is correct in the two cases.
The principal limitation of our deduction is contained
in the assumption expressed above for the slab example:
Eafterk ≃ k
i. e. the condition of no reﬂection
k
supposing the perturbation on the motion of the wave to
be small. Nevertheless, the principal origin of the Fres-
nel eﬀect is justiﬁed in our scheme without the use of the
Einstein relativity principle.
We can naturally ask if the simple analogy proposed can
not be extended to a dense medium i. e. without the ap-
proximation of a weak density N0 or of a low reﬂectivity.
In order to see that it is indeed true we return to the
electromagnetic theory and we suppose an inﬁnite mov-
ing medium like the one considered in the second section.
In the rest frame of the medium we can deﬁne a slab of
length L0. The unique diﬀerence with the section 3 is
that now this slab is not bounded by two interfaces sepa-
rating the atoms from the vacuum but is surrounded by a
continuous medium having the same properties and mov-
ing at the same velocity ve. In the laboratory frame the
length of the moving slab is L = L0γ−1
e . We can write
the time ∆τe taken by a signal like a wave packet, a wave
front or a plane of constant phase to travel through the
moving slab:

c∆τe = n

(L + ve∆τe) .

(37)

·

The optical index n can be the one deﬁned in section 2
for the case of the Drude model but the result is very gen-
eral. We can now introduce a time δt0 such that Eq. 25,
and consequently Eq. 27, are true by deﬁnition. We con-
clude that this last equation Eq. 27 is equivalent to the
relativistic Eq. 29 if, and only if, we deﬁne the time δt0
by the formula

δt0 = (n0 −

1)

L0/c.

·

(38)

In other terms we can always use the analogy with a pho-
ton pursuing an atom since the general formula Eq. 29

is true whatever the microscopic and Electrodynamics
model considered. In this model - based on a retardation
eﬀect- the absorbtion time δt0 is always given by Eq. 38.
This opens new perspectives when we consider the prob-
lem of a sound wave propagating in an eﬀective moving
medium.
Indeed there are several situations where we
can develop a deep analogy between the propagation of
sound and the propagation of light. This implies that
the conclusions obtained for the Fresnel eﬀect for light
must to a large part be valid for sound as well. This is in
particular true if we consider an eﬀective meta material
like the one that is going to be described now:
We consider a system of mirrors as represented in Fig. 2A,
at rest in the laboratory. A beam of light propagates
along the zigzag trajectory A0, B0, A1, ..., An, Bn, .... The
(L2
0 + D2) where the distance
length AnBn is given by
L0 and D are represented on the ﬁgure. The time ∆τ0
spent by a particle of light to move along AnBn is then
0 + D2)/c. We can equivalently deﬁne an eﬀective

(L2

optical index n0 such that we have
p

(L2

c2

0 =

L2
0n2

This implies

n2

We consider now the same problem for a system of mir-
rors moving with the velocity ve.
In order to be con-
sistent with relativity we introduce the reduced length
L = L0γ−1
e . The beam propagating along the path
A0, B0, A1, ..., An, Bn, ... must pursue the set of mirrors.
We then deﬁne the travel time ∆τe along an elementary
path AnBn by

((L + ve∆τe)2 + D2)
c2

= ∆τ 2

e =

((L + ve∆τe)2n2

where n is the eﬀective optical index for the moving
medium. From this equation we deduce ﬁrst ∆τe =

We can again justify the Fresnel formula at the limit

trons and photons but only on geometrical parameters.
Clearly we can make the same reasoning for a sound wave
by putting γe = 1. This still gives us the Fresnel formula
when we neglect terms equal or smaller than O

emergence of a delay time – a retardation eﬀect– when we
consider the propagation of the signal at a microscopic
or internal level. The index n which characterizes the
macroscopic or external approach is then just a way to
deﬁne an eﬀective velocity without looking for a causal
explanation of the retardation.
The essential message of our analysis is that by taking
explicitly into account the physical origin of the delay we
can justify the essence of the Fresnel-Fizeau eﬀect in a
non relativistic way. The Fresnel-Fizeau eﬀect is then a
very general phenomenon. It is a consequence of the con-
servation of energy and momentum and of the constant
value of the wave velocity in vacuum or in the considered
medium. The so called travel condition (Eq. 26) which
is a combination of these two points can be compared to
the usual demonstration for the Doppler eﬀect. In these
two cases of light pulses pursuing a moving particle the
ve/c) is a manifesta-
perturbation time δtve ≃
tion of the Doppler phenomenon. It should be empha-
sized that the analogy between sound and electromag-
netic waves discussed in this article could be compared
to the similarities between sound wave and gravitational
waves discussed in particular by Unruh. On this subject
and some connected discussions concerning the acous-
tic Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect (that is related to the optical
Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect that follows from the Fizeau ef-
fect) the reader should consult18,19.

V. SUMMARY

We have obtain the Fresnel-Fizeau formula using a per-
turbation method based on the optical theorem and in a
more general way by considering the physical origin of

the refractive index. The modiﬁcation of the speed of
light in the medium appears then as a result of a retar-
dation eﬀect due to the duration of the interaction or ab-
sorbtion of light by the medium, and the Fresnel-Fizeau
eﬀect, as a direct consequence of the medium’s ﬂight in
front of the light. These facts rely on the same origin as
the Doppler-Fizeau eﬀect. We ﬁnally have shown that
it is not correct to assume, as frequently done in the
past, that a coherent and “Newtonian interpretation”
of these phenomena would be impossible. On the con-
trary, the results do not invalidate the derivation of the
Fresnel-Fizeau eﬀect based on the principle of relativity
but clarify it. We observe indeed than all reasoning is
in perfect agreement with the principle of relativity. We
must emphasize that even if the Fizeau/Fresnel eﬀect
is conceptually divorced from relativity it strongly mo-
tivated Einstein’s work (more even than the Michelson
and Morley result). The fact that the Fizeau as well as
the Michelson-Morley experiment can be justiﬁed so eas-
ily with special relativity clearly show the advantages of
Einstein’s principle to obtain quickly the correct results.
Nevertheless, if we look from a dynamical point of view,
as it is the case here, this principle plays a role only for
eﬀects of order v2
e/c2 which however are not necessary to
justify the Fresnel formula.

APPENDIX A

Maxwell’s equations impose the continuity of the elec-
tric ﬁeld on each interface of the slab. More pre-
cisely these boundary relations impose: Emedium A|S =
Emedium B|S where S is one of the two moving inter-
faces separating vacuum and matter. Hence we obtain an
equality condition between the two phases φmedium A and
φmedium B valid for all times at the interface. Let Φ1 =
x/c) be the phase of the plane wave before the

slab. In a similar way let Φ2 =
and Φ3 =
δ3) be the phases in the slab
iω3 (t
and in vacuum after traversing the slab, respectively. In
these expressions there appear two retardation constants,
δ2,3 and the optical index of the slab. On the ﬁrst inter-
face denoted by (I-II) we have x = cβet and consequently

FIG. 3: In this ﬁgure Q is the position of the particle at the
retarded time tret and P is the observation point at the time t.
The particle moves uniformly on the the x line QR following
the trajectory vet and Q’ is the position of the particle at the
time t separated of P by the distance r. In addition, if we call
R the projection of P on QR, then x and ρ are the coordinates
of the observation point in the plane of the ﬁgure.

Using geometrical considerations (see Fig. 3) we can

deduce the relation

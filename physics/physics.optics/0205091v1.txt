Abstract

We present an algorithm for the maximization of photonic bandgaps in two-dimensional
crystals. Once the translational symmetries of the underlying structure have been imposed, our
algorithm ﬁnds a global maximal (and complete, if one exists) bandgap. Additionally, we prove
two remarkable results related to maximal bandgaps: the so-called ‘maximum contrast’ rule,
and about the location in the Brillouin zone of band edges.

Introduction

Photonic crystals are structures where the electromagnetic properties of the constituent material are
periodic in space. They have been intensely studied recently [1] both for their practical applications
and the theoretical challenges they pose. One area of research is the design and fabrication of
structures that do not allow electromagnetic waves with frequencies in a certain range to propagate
in them. Such structures are expected to ﬁnd use as perfect mirrors and guiding structures, etc. In
many applications, it is desirable that the excluded frequency range – the bandgap – be as large
as possible. In this paper, we focus our attention on the design of structures with such maximal
bandgaps.

The design problem that we propose to solve has been addressed before [2, 3, 4]. The starting
point in each approach has been to impose the translational symmetries of the structure to be
designed, and to impose global constraints that the material properties must staisfy (maximum and
minimum dielectric constants, for instance). We do the same. In earlier approaches, the next step
involved exploring a subset of the structures that satisfy the imposed translational symmetry. Our
algorithm, in contrast, involves an unrestricted exploration of all the structures that satisfy the
imposed conditions. Notably, the algorithm is polarization non-speciﬁc; it can maximize a complete
bandgap (i.e. a frequency range that is excluded for all polarizations).

The algorithm we propose is based on incremental steps, each of which increases the size of the
selected bandgap. Each step is based on a variational argument that is discussed in [5] and outlined
below.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we present the equations relevant to
the problem. Thereafter, we outline the variational argument we use and describe an algorithm to
implement this in the case where the dielectric constant of the material is required to lie in a certain

1

range. We have numerically implemented the algorithm; the details of the implementation will be
presented elsewhere.

Two remarkable results follow quite easily from our discussion: First, that for a maximal bandgap
structure where the dielectric constant is allowed to vary within a range, the dielectric constant at
each point takes on either the smallest or the largest possible value. Second, that the wavevectors
corresponding to the edges of a maximal bandgap may take on values only from a very small subset
of the Brillouin zone.

2 Maxwell equations in two-dimensional systems

We consider a two-dimensional photonic crystal with a dielectric constant ǫ(~r) that is periodic
in two independent directions (that deﬁne the x-y plane) and homogeneous in the third (the z-
direction). The magnetic susceptibility of the constituent material is assumed spatially constant. In
this system, electromagnetic waves with wave vectors in the x-y plane come in two distinct species:
E-polarization, where the electric ﬁeld vector is parallel to the z-direction; and, H-polarization,
where the magnetic ﬁeld vector is parallel to the z-direction. In the former case, Maxwell equations
yield

E and H are the z-components of the electric ﬁeld and magnetization vectors, respectively. (See [4]
for details of derivation.) Each of these equations has the form Du = λu, where D is a Hermitian
operator. In the case of E-polarization,

and u ≡ H. In both cases, λ ≡ −ω2/c2. For ease of exposition, we will set c = 1.

It is well-known that the spectra of eigenvalues of the equations above display ‘bands’. Given two
bands, the diﬀerence between the smallest eigenvalue of the upper band and the largest eigenvalue of
the lower band characterizes the bandgap. (We will focus our attention on the spectrum of ω, rather
than λ.) After having selected two adjacent bands, we will seek a function ǫ(~r) that maximizes the
bandgap between them. In general, ǫ(~r) may be subject to imposed constraints. While the method
outlined below may be used to handle a variety of constraints, we will conﬁne ourselves to a speciﬁc
one: ǫmin ≤ ǫ(~r) ≤ ǫmax.

3 The variational algorithm

Starting with the standard eigenvalue problem Du = λu, where D is a Hermitian operator, we will
ﬁrst investigate changes in λ due to changes in D. Preﬁxing δ to denote ‘change in’

(u + δu)†(D + δD)(u + δu) = λ + δλ.

Retaining terms to ﬁrst order in the changes, and noting that for normalized eigenfunctions, u†δu =
0,

u†δDu = δλ.

Change in D is due to change δǫ in ǫ. In the case of E-polarization,

: E − polarization
: H − polarization.

It is not ω but, rather, a diﬀerence ω2 − ω1, that we seek to maximize with respect to variations
in ǫ. Thus, we would like to tailor variations in ǫ so that δ(ω2 − ω1) > 0. This is achieved if δǫ > 0
wherever δω2/δǫ > δω1/δǫ, and vice versa. If ǫ = ǫmax (ǫ = ǫmin), it is impossible to achieve δǫ > 0
(δǫ < 0). Therefore, maximal ω2 − ω1 is expected when ǫ = ǫmax wherever δω2/δǫ > δω1/δǫ, and
ǫ = ǫmin wherever δω2/δǫ < δω1/δǫ. Note that no explicit reference to polarization has been made;
ω1 and ω2 may even be eigenvalues corresponding to diﬀerent polarizations. This makes it possible
for our algorithm to maximize the size of complete bandgaps.

This suggests the following iterative algorithm to a maximal bandgap:

0. Choose periodicity of ǫ(~r), and the adjacent bands that straddle the bandgap to be maximized.

Initialize with an arbitrary (but appropriately periodic) ǫ(~r).

1. Determine, using ǫ(~r), the spectrum of eigenvalues ω and the wavefunctions u.

2. Determine the wavefunctions that correspond to the smallest eigenvalue of the upper band (u2

and ω2) and the largest eigenvalue of the lower band (u1 and ω1).

3. Make small changes δǫ in ǫ(~r): δǫ ≥ 0 wherever δω2/δǫ > δω1/δǫ (determined using the
expressions in (8)), and vice versa. (Maintain consistency with the constraint ǫmin ≤ ǫ(~r) ≤
ǫmax.)

4. Go to 1 unless termination/convergence criteria are met.

A discussion of some of the ﬁner points of each step follows.

The initialization step requires the lattice parameters as input, both to establish a length scale
and to ﬁx the translational symmetry of the system. It is in this sense – and this sense only – that
the maximum attained is not global. (Observe that, due to the scaling properties of the eigenvalue
equations, maximization without an imposed length scale is trivial.)

Considerable work [6, 7] has been done towards numerical solution of the eigenvalue equations
for arbitrary ǫ(~r). The usual practice is to ﬁrst discretize the space in some manner, then select a
reasonably dense subset of wavevectors from the Brillouin zone and, ﬁnally, obtain the eigenvalues
corresponding to each wavevector.

Remarkably, it turns out that it is not necessary to perform a complete bandstructure compu-
tation to implement our scheme. To see this, note ﬁrst that, since ǫ(~r) is real, wavevectors ±~k have
degenerate spectra. Therefore, any arbitrary linear combination u = αu~k + βu−~k is an eigenfunc-
tion. Note, too, from our earlier discussion (equation (8) and following paragraph), that either of
the wavefunctions u = u2 or u = u1 that straddle the bandgap must be such that |u|2 (or |~∇u|2)
has the same translational symmetry as the underlying lattice. This severely limits the possible
values of ~k at the band-edges. In the case of a square lattice, it is easy to see that the only possible
values of ~k are those with 0 or ±π as components. It is, thus, possible to limit the search – for a
maximal-bandgap producing conﬁguration of ǫ(~r) in a 2D square lattice – to wavevectors 0, (0, π),
(π, 0) and (π, π)!

Another remarkable result – referred to following equation (8) and hinted at in step 3 of the
algorithm – is the‘maximum-contrast’ rule: if ǫ(~r) is allowed to vary arbitrarily between two limits
then maximal bandgaps are obtained when ǫ(~r) attains one or the other extremal value at each
point. (See [5] for a related detailed discussion.)

One question that we have not answered here is whether the iterative algorithm converges.
In a one-dimensional system (where exact results may be obtained otherwise and where E- and H-
polarization spectra are degenerate), the algorithm does indeed converge rapidly to expected results.
In 2D, numerical results obtained so far provide very strong evidence in favor of convergence. These
results will be presented elsewhere [7].

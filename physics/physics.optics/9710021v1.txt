The propagation of an electromagnetic pulse in a plasma is studied for pulse durations that are comparable to the
plasma period. When the carrier frequency of the incident pulse is much higher than the plasma frequency, the pulse
propagates without distortion at its group speed. When the carrier frequency is comparable to the plasma
frequency, the pulse is distorted and leaves behind it an electromagnetic wake.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. ANALYSIS

The propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a
medium [1] is controlled by the dielectric function, wich
characterizes the response of the medium to the applied
electromagnetic ﬁeld. The dielectric function of a plasma
is 1 − ω2
p/ω2, where ωp is the plasma frequency, and ω
is the frequency of any Fourier component of the wave.
This simple formula also characterizes the response of
a dielectric medium when the Fourier spectrum of the
wave contains frequencies that are much higher than the
resonance frequencies of the medium.

1/2

When a monochromatic wave of frequency ω is incident
upon a vacuum-plasma boundary, a fraction 2kI /(kT +
kI ) is transmitted and a fraction (kT − kI )/(kT + kI ) is
reﬂected, where kI = ω/c is the wave number of the inci-
dent wave, and kT = (ω2 − ω2
/c is the wave number
p)
of the transmitted wave. Now consider an electromag-
netic pulse with carrier frequency ωc and envelope fre-
quency ωe. The formulas for the transmission and re-
ﬂection of a monochromatic wave are also valid for a
long pulse, provided one substitutes ωc for ω. When
ωc ≤ ωp, the incident pulse is reﬂected completely. When
ωc > ωp, the transmitted part of a long pulse propagates
1/2
without distortion at its group speed c(1 − ω2
.
Eventually, the transmitted pulse disperses. These re-
sults are known to be valid for ωe ≪ ωp. In this paper
we study electromagnetic propagation in the complemen-
tary regime ωe ∼ ωp. Short-pulse propagation is gen-
erally relevant when the long-envelope approximation is
not valid. A speciﬁc example is the wakeﬁeld accelerator
concept [2,3].

p/ω2

We use Laplace transform and Green function tech-
niques to analyze the interaction between the laser pulse
and the plasma. We ﬁnd that the interaction can be
divided into two stages, one in which temporal transmis-
sion and reﬂection occurs at the vacuum-plasma bound-
ary, and one in which the transmitted and reﬂected pulse
propagate in the plasma and vacuum, respectively. We
then present details of what happens at each stage, for
incident pulses of varying carrier frequency and duration.

We consider a laser pulse with electric ﬁeld E(t, x) that
propagates in vacuum when x < 0, enters the plasma at
x = 0, and propagates through the plasma for x > 0.
We assume that the plasma is characterized by a plasma
frequency ωp. The wave equation obeyed by E(t, x) is
given by

(∂2

tt − c2∂2

xx + ω2

p)E(t, x) = 0,

(1)

tt and ∂2

where ∂2
xx are second-order partial derivatives
with respect to time t and space x, and where c is the
speed of light in vacuum.

Let ωpt → t, ωpx/c → x, so that t and x become

dimensionless. Then the wave equation (1) becomes

(∂2

tt − ∂2

xx + 1)E(t, x) = 0.

(2)

In general, some fraction of the incoming laser pulse is
reﬂected at the vacuum-plasma boundary, while the rest
is transmitted into the plasma. We denote the incident
electric ﬁeld by EI (t, x), the reﬂected ﬁeld by ER(t, x),
and the transmitted ﬁeld by ET (t, x). Since the electric
ﬁeld is continuous across the boundary [1],

EI (t, 0) + ER(t, 0) = ET (t, 0).

(3)

Similarly, since the magnetic ﬁeld of the pulse is contin-
uous across the boundary [1],

∂xEI (t, 0) + ∂xER(t, 0) = ∂xET (t, 0).

(4)

We next take the temporal Laplace transform of Eqs.
(3) and (4) to obtain the equivalent boundary conditions
in Laplace space,

EI (s, 0) + ER(s, 0) = ET (s, 0),
∂xEI (s, 0) + ∂xER(s, 0) = ∂xET (s, 0).

(5)

In general, the incident ﬁeld EI (t, x) propagates to
the right (toward the plasma), while the reﬂected ﬁeld
ER(t, x) propagates to the left (away from the plasma).

(9)

We may therefore assume that EI (t, x) and ER(t, x) have
the space-time dependencies

where

ΓR(s, x) = R(s)GR(s, x),

(16)

which are consistent with the reduced equations

GR(s, x) = exp(sx).

(17)

EI (t, x) = EI (t − x),
ER(t, x) = ER(t + x),

(∂t + ∂x)EI (t, x) = 0,
(∂t − ∂x)ER(t, x) = 0.

dxEI (s, 0) = −sEI (s, 0),
dxER(s, 0) = sER(s, 0).

By taking the temporal Laplace transform of Eqs. (7),
and letting x → 0, we obtain the boundary expressions

R(s) =

s − (s2 + 1)1/2
s + (s2 + 1)1/2 ,

From the above discussion, it is clear that R(s) represents
the reﬂection of the incident pulse at the vacuum-plasma
surface, whereas the factor GR(s, x) accounts for the sub-
sequent propagation of the reﬂected pulse in vacuum.

Similarly, we write the transmission Green function in

the form

ΓT (s, x) = T (s)GT (s, x),

(18)

The Laplace transform ET (s, x) of the transmitted

where

ﬁeld ET (t, x) satisﬁes the equation

[d2

xx − (s2 + 1)]ET (s, x) = 0,

which follows from (2). We choose the causal solution
(note that x > 0)

ET (s, x) = ET (s, 0) exp[−(s2 + 1)1/2x],

(10)

so that, at the boundary x = 0, we have

T (s) =

2s
s + (s2 + 1)1/2 ,

GT (s, x) = exp[−(s2 + 1)1/2x].

(19)

Here T (s) represents the transmission of the incident
pulse across the vacuum-plasma surface, whereas the fac-
tor GT (s, x) represents the subsequent propagation of the
transmitted pulse in the plasma.

We see from (17) and (19) that R(s) and T (s) are

dxET (s, 0) = −(s2 + 1)1/2ET (s, 0).

(11)

related through the equation

Substitution of (8) and (11) into (5) yields the bound-

ary condition

sEI (s, 0) − sER(s, 0) = (s2 + 1)1/2ET (s, 0).

(12)

Equations (5) and (12) imply that

ER(s, 0) =

s − (s2 + 1)1/2
s + (s2 + 1)1/2 EI (s, 0),

ET (s, 0) =

s + (s2 + 1)1/2 EI (s, 0).

(13)

2s

It follows from the second of Eqs. (7) that

ER(s, x) = ER(s, 0) exp(sx).

(14)

T (s) = 1 + R(s),

(20)

which just states the fact that the electric ﬁeld is con-
served.

The inﬂuence of pulse duration and carrier frequency
on the pulses’ transmission and subsequent propagation
in a plasma can be investigated by considering boundary
ﬁelds EI (t, 0) of the form

EI (t, 0) = exp(−ω2

e t2) cos(ωct).

(21)

The parameters ωe and ωc are measures of the temporal
envelope width and carrier frequency respectively, of the
incident pulse at the x = 0 boundary. We give in Table I a
classiﬁcation of the incident pulses (21) at the boundary.

Finally, (10), (13), and (14) yield

ER(s, x) =

ET (s, x) =

(15)

The coeﬃcients of EI (s, 0) in (15) are just the Green
functions ΓR(s, x) and ΓT (s, x) in Laplace space for the
reﬂected and transmitted pulse, respectively. We write
the reﬂection Green function in the form

The inverse temporal Laplace transform of (20) is [4]

T (t) = δ(t) − (2/t)J2(t)H(t).

(22)

T (t) represents the part of the laser-plasma interaction
in which the incident pulse is transmitted across the
vacuum-plasma boundary x = 0. The ﬁrst term in (22)
represents the undistorted transmission of a pulse into
the plasma, while the second term represents the reﬂec-
tion R(t) at x = 0,

This is evident by comparing (20) with (22). Equa-
tion (23) shows that the reﬂection of the laser pulse at
the vacuum-plasma boundary is not instantaneous, but
rather a decaying, oscillatory function of time. This in-
dicates that there is a harmonic response in the plasma
to the incident pulse, which produces a delayed, rather
than instantaneous, reﬂected pulse. This response takes
the form of harmonic oscillations of plasma charges about
their equilibrium positions, which are induced by the in-
cident sinusoidal pulse.

One can investigate the dependence of the reﬂected
pulse at x = 0 on the duration and frequency of an im-
pinging pulse EI (t, 0) by calculating the convolution

for diﬀerent values of the parameters ωe and ωc in
EI (t, 0), where EI (t, 0) is given by (21). Figure 1 shows
the reﬂection response for incident pulses of intermedi-
ate duration (ID), with carrier frequencies varying from
intermediate (IF) to high (HF). Figure 2 shows the reﬂec-
tion response for incident pulses of short duration (SD),
again with carrier frequencies varying from intermediate
(IF) to high (HF). It is seen in Figs. 1 and 2 that the
reﬂection response diminishes as the carrier frequency of
the pulse is increased. We also note that as the duration
of a pulse is shortened (i.e., as ωe is increased beyond
1), the reﬂection response diminishes. This is consistent
with the fact that, as an incident pulse is shortened, more
of it will already have entered and propagated into the
plasma before the plasma’s delayed reﬂection response
[as described below (23)] takes place.
In particular, if
ωe ≫ 1, the pulse is transmitted completely, with no
distortion.

FIG. 2. Same as in Fig.1, but for an incident pulse of short

duration (ωe = 5).

The propagation of the reﬂected pulse in vacuum is
characterized by the function GR(t, x), which is the in-
verse of GR(s, x) in (17),

This means that the reﬂected pulse ER(t, x) has the
space-time dependence ER(t, x) = ER(t + x), and prop-
agates through the vacuum in the negative x-direction
away from the vacuum-plasma boundary, and without
distortion.

We now focus on the transmitted pulse ET (t, x). The
propagation of the transmitted pulse through the plasma
is characterized by the function GT (t, x) given by the
inverse of GT (s, x) in (19). GT (t, x) is found by ﬁrst
writing GT (s, x) as the spatial derivative

GT (s, x) = −∂xF T (s, x),

where

F T (s, x) =

exp[−(s2 + 1)1/2x]
(s2 + 1)1/2

.

(26)

(27)

The inverse of F T (s, x) is given by [4]

FT (t, x) = J0[(t2 − x2)1/2]H(t − x),

(28)

so that

GT (t, x) = δ(t − x)

− x

J1[(t2 − x2)1/2]
(t2 − x2)1/2 H(t − x).

(29)

Equation (29) represents the combined eﬀect of a distor-
tionless propagation of the transmitted pulse (ﬁrst term)
and the propagation of a dispersive wake generated by
the plasma (second term).

We next compute the total Green function ΓT (t, x) by
inverting (18). One way to do this is to compute ΓT (t, x)
as the convolution

of intermediate duration. Figures 3 and 4 show plots
of the propagation of ID-HF and ID-IF incident pulses,
respectively.

where T (t) is given by (22), and GT (t, x) by (29). Again,
(30) clearly shows the two-stage process of transmission
followed by propagation. Analytic evaluation of (30) is
quite involved. However, there is a simpler method for
obtaining ΓT (t, x) analytically that avoids integration,
and requires only the computation of derivatives. From
(18) and (19), we see that ΓT (s, x) can be written as the
derivative

This inverse transform only holds for x > 0, which is in
accord with our assumptions of the pulse entering the
plasma at x = 0, and propagating into the plasma for
x > 0. Since F (0+, x) = 0 for x > 0, we have from
standard Laplace transform theory that ∂tF (t, x) is the
inverse transform of sf (s, x). Therefore, from (31), we
have

The term −2∂2
txF (t, x) in (34) represents a modiﬁcation

We see that the high frequency (HF) incident pulse
propagates practically undisturbed across the vacuum-
plasma interface and into the plasma, while the
intermediate-frequency pulse develops an electromag-
netic (EM) wake.
In the Appendix, we derive the fol-
lowing perturbative expansions for vg and vp in the high-
frequency case:

vg ≈ 1 − ǫ2/2 − ǫ4/8,
vp = 1/vg ≈ 1 + ǫ2/2 + 3ǫ4/8,

(37)

where ǫ = ωp/ωc. The right sides of Eqs. (37) are just
the ﬁrst three terms in the MacLaurin expansions of (1 −
ǫ2)1/2 and (1 − ǫ2)−1/2.

We next consider the propagation of short (SD) inci-
dent pulses. Figure 5 shows a plot of an incident SD-IF
pulse.

As expected, the wake generation is smaller than for
the incident ID-IF pulse. And as the frequency of the
incident SD pulse is increased, it is found that wake gen-
eration is practically nonexistent.

III. SUMMARY

In this paper, we considered the transmission and re-
ﬂection of an electromagnetic pulse at a vacuum-plasma
boundary, and the subsequent propagation of the trans-
mitted pulse in the plasma. We extended the well-known
theory for long pulses into the short-pulse regime,
in
which the pulse duration is comparable to the inverse
plasma frequency. When the carrier frequency of the in-
cident pulse is much higher than the plasma frequency,
most of the incident pulse is transmitted without dis-
tortion. Subsequently, the transmitted pulse propagates
without distortion at its group speed. When the car-
rier frequency is comparable to the plasma frequency,
the transmitted pulse is distorted, and leaves behind it
an electromagnetic wake. The reﬂected pulse is delayed
relative to the incident pulse, and is also distorted. When
the carrier frequency is less than the plasma frequency,
the incident pulse is absorbed by the plasma before being
reemitted.

APPENDIX A: PROPAGATION OF A

Let ωct → t, ωcx/c → x, and ωp/ωc → ǫ, so that t and
x become dimensionless. Then the wave equation (1) can
be written as

The study of pulse propagation is facilitated by the char-
acteristic transformation

where β < 1. In terms of the characteristic variables τ
and ξ, the wave equation (A1) can be rewritten as

(1 − β2)(∂2

τ τ − ∂2

ξξ) + ǫ2

E = 0.

(A3)

(cid:2)

One can solve Eq. (A3) by using multiple scale analysis
[5]. To do this, one introduces the time and distance
scales

(cid:3)

τn = ǫnτ, ξn = ǫnξ.

(A4)

Correct to second order, one can write

∂τ ≈ ∂τ0 + ǫ∂τ1 + ǫ2∂τ2 ,
∂ξ ≈ ∂ξ0 + ǫ∂ξ1 + ǫ2∂ξ2 .

Guided by the well-known characteristics of a long pulse,
we assume that

β ≈ 1 + ǫ2β2 + ǫ4β4

and

E(τ, ξ) = B(τ2, ξ1) exp(−iτ0).

(A7)

Ansatz (A7) corresponds to a pulse that has a carrier fre-
quency of unity and an amplitude that varies on the slow
scale ξ1. For this amplitude variation, β is the group
speed of the pulse, and the characteristic variables are
proportional to time and distance measured in the pulse
frame. One now substitutes Eqs.
(A5) - (A7) in Eq.
(A3) and collects terms of like order. The zeroth- and
ﬁrst-order equations are satisﬁed automatically by con-
struction.

In second order,

(A11)

The pulse has a carrier frequency of unity by construc-
tion, so the dependence of E on τ2 cannot be oscillatory.
It follows from this constraint that (2β4 + β2
2 ) = 0 and,
hence, that

(cid:3)

β4 = −1/8.

(A12)

The group speed β ≈ 1 − ǫ2/2 − ǫ4/8, which is just the
ﬁrst three terms in the Maclaurin expansion of (1−ǫ2)1/2.
The remaining nonzero terms in Eq. (A11) are

2i∂τ2 + ∂2

ξ1ξ1

B = 0,

(A13)

(cid:0)

which describe the dispersal of the pulse.

(cid:1)
Finally, note that ansatz (A7) constrains the phase
speed to be the inverse of the group speed. Since no
contradictions appear in the subsequent analysis, the as-
sumptions underlying ansatz (A7) are correct. One can
also use the ansatz

E(τ, ξ) = B(τ2, ξ1) exp[iνξ0 − i(1 − νβ)τ0],

(A14)

which does not constrain the phase speed, but leads to
the same result.

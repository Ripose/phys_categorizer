Abstract

Line-by-line calculations are becoming the standard
procedure for carrying spectral simulations. However, it is
important to insure the accuracy of such spectral simula-
tions through the choice of adapted models for the simula-
tion of key parameters such as line position, intensity, and
shape. Moreover, it is necessary to rely on accurate spec-
tral data to guaranty the accuracy of the simulated spec-
tra. A discussion on the most accurate models available
for such calculations is presented for diatomic and linear
polyatomic discrete radiation, and possible reductions on
the number of calculated lines are discussed in order to re-
duce memory and computational overheads. Examples of
diﬀerent approaches for the simulation of experimentally
determined low-pressure molecular spectra are presented.
The accuracy of diﬀerent simulation approaches is dis-
cussed and it is veriﬁed that a careful choice of applied
computational models and spectroscopic datasets yields
precise approximations of the measured spectra.

Keywords: Line-by-line simulations, Spectroscopic data,
Low pressure plasmas

1 Introduction

Advances in the capabilities of modern day computing
have allowed carrying line-by-line calculations in a sys-
tematic manner for the ﬁeld of spectroscopy modelling.
Various applications such as species concentrations and
temperature measurements in low pressure plasmas [1, 2],
or the calculation of radiative ﬂuxes for atmospheric en-
try ﬂows [3], greatly beneﬁt from such techniques. How-
ever, the accuracy of such spectral simulations may vary

consequently, depending on the methods used for line-by-
line calculations, but also on the applied spectroscopic
datasets.

The diﬀerent methods used for the calculation of key
spectral parameters such as line positions, intensities, and
shapes are discussed in this paper. Available state of the
art models for each of these parameters are presented,
and some simpliﬁcations to such spectral models are dis-
cussed, leading to lower memory requirements and calcu-
lation times for the used computing systems. The mod-
els presented and discussed in this paper are valid for
diatomic rovibronic transitions, but also for linear poly-
atomic rovibrational transitions (such as transitions from
the CO2 molecule). The second part of this work presents
some simulations of experimentally measured high res-
olution spectra issued from low pressure and high en-
thalpy plasmas. The discrepancies that may derive from
the selection of diﬀerent simulation models and spectral
datasets will be highlighted through the comparison of
diﬀerent simulated spectra with the measured spectra. It
will be veriﬁed that a careful selection of adequate mod-
els, linked to a selection of accurate spectroscopic data,
may yield a very accurate reproduction of high resolution
measured spectra.

2 Theoretical Models for the Simulation
of Bound Spectra in the Line-by-Line
Approach

Discrete molecular radiation can be characterized un-
ambiguously through three parameters: line position, in-
tensity, and shape

Determination of line positions depends on the quan-
tiﬁcation of the energy levels of the molecule bound states.
Line intensities depend on the probabilities of transition
between the diﬀerent states, as well as on the population

of these states. Finally, line shapes depend on the local
conditions of the gas in which the transition takes place1.
An overview of the diﬀerent methods and approaches to
several levels of accuracy will be presented in this section
for these three parameters.

exist, and care should be exercised when using published
coeﬃcients.

Traditional spectroscopic developments are related to

Zare’s Klein-Dunham coeﬃcients by:

2.1 Line Positions Calculations

Three diﬀerent approaches exist for the calculation of
quantum level energies which will determine line positions
of bound molecular spectra:

The ﬁrst one allows a broad calculation of any number
of vibrational and rotational levels for a given electronic
transition of a molecule. Calculations are performed us-
ing equilibrium constants, which give the vibrational and
rotational constants for the given electronic transition in
a broad range of vibration and rotation levels.

The second one uses level-by-level spectroscopic con-
stants and allows the calculation of any number of rota-
tional levels for given electronic and vibrational transition
levels of a molecule, as the band origin and rotational con-
stants are set for each vibration level. This approach gen-
erally allows a better determination of speciﬁc vibration
levels energies but prevents one from simulating further
levels than those for which spectroscopic data is available.
The third one, and the more accurate, requires diag-
onalising the corresponding hamiltonian matrix for each
rovibronic state. This approach can be useful when the
experimental spectra to be simulated is strongly per-
turbed although it leads to larger computational times.

2.1.1 Line position calculations using equilibrium

constants in matrix form

Klein-Dunham coeﬃcients allow a clear and unambigu-
ous determination of level positions, compared to the tra-
ditional spectroscopic developments, prone to confusions
and errors (for instance, the parameter γe, useful for the
calculation of the rotational constant Bv can sometimes
be confused with the spin-rotation interaction coeﬃcient
γ).

Level positions (in cm−1) are calculated according to

the following relation:

The use of Klein-Dunham expansions, unlike tradi-
tional developments, may also prevent situations were
neglecting higher order corrections leads to considerable
shifts for the position of calculated lines compared to the
experimental spectrum [5].

Setting a matrix of Klein-Dunham coeﬃcients such as
i = 10 and j = 7 in computer routines for line position
calculations suﬃces in order to account for the available
polynomial expansions as veriﬁed by a broad review of
available spectroscopic coeﬃcients by the author.

For multiplet transitions, the expression for the level
energies diﬀers slightly from Eq. 1, but the general form
of the Klein–Dunham matrix can be used. Expressions
for the diﬀerent multiplet level energies are presented in
appendix A.

2.1.2 Further line position calculation methods

When the level positions can no longer be accu-
rately approximated through Klein-Dunham expansions
(as when vibrational perturbations of the spectra are
present), spectroscopic constants for each vibrational
level must be used. Level spectroscopic constants ob-
tained from ﬁts of the rotational lines for each vibrational
band are given in this case. Using such level constants
usually results in more accurate predictions of the level

2 Theoretical Models for the Simulation of Bound Spectra in the Line-by-Line Approach

energies. However calculations are restricted to the vibra-
tional levels were spectroscopic constants are available,
unlike Klein-Dunham expansions which allow higher level
extrapolations of the available spectroscopic data.

The absorption coeﬃcient including spontaneous and
induced absorption (adopting the normalization factor
2J + 1 for the H¨onl-London coeﬃcients and excluding
broadening mechanisms) is given by the relation

When perturbations are present in the spectra, the
polynomial expansions described previously no longer suf-
ﬁce for the accurate simulation of line positions. Instead,
one has to solve the Hamiltonian matrix, taking into ac-
count the eﬀects of the perturbing states using the pertur-
bation method [6]. This leads to very precise calculations
of the line positions (typically less than 0.1 cm−1). How-
ever, this method requires the calculation of the proper
values of a n ∗ n matrix for each rovibronic state where n
is the level multiplicity.

2.2 Line Intensities Calculations

An overview of the diﬀerent methods used for the cal-
culation of line emission and absorption as well as the
diﬀerent diﬃculties and approximations seldom encoun-
tered will be presented in this section.

The emission coeﬃcient for a single line (excluding
broadening mechanisms) is calculated according to the
relation

Eq. 3 highlights the additional diﬃculties related to
line intensity calculations. These depend not only on the
line positions (through the accounting of the transition
energy ∆E), but also on the transition probabilities Aul
and the number density of the initial state Nu. Although
the two former quantities only depend on the transition
parameters, being calculated according to quantum me-
chanics laws, the latter depends on the state of the studied
gas.

2.2.1 Dependence between line emission and

absorption coeﬃcients

The radiative properties of a gas can be unambiguously
it’s wavelength-
known through the determination of
dependent emission and absorption coeﬃcients εν and
α(ν). These two quantities are not independent however,
and line absorption coeﬃcients can be determined from
the line emission coeﬃcients.

One can therefore deduce the following relationships

the dissociation limits for molecules and ionization limits
for atoms). Namely, the lowering of the ionisation thresh-
old for atomic species has to be considered in the plasma
state, when including the contribution of the atomic Ry-
dberg states to the overall partition function [7]. Also,
for molecular partition functions calculations, it is neces-
sary to determine the maximum rovibronic levels which
can be achieved before the dissociation of the molecule
occurs (including superdissociative states).

Out of thermodynamic equilibrium, no straightforward
method for calculating the levels populations exists, and
one has to resort to state-to-state models which explicitly
take into account the diﬀerent possible discrete states of
a gas species. The development of accurate state-to-state
models has been carried by diﬀerent research teams, and
the reader should refer to the references [8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14] for a more detailed description of such models.

surements, or from “ab-initio” calculations. This last
method is usually preferred, as nowadays, quantum meth-
ods have achieved a very good precision [21]. The vibra-
tional wavefunctions are determined by solving the radial
Schr¨odinger equation on the potential curves of the upper
and lower level potential curves.

Potential curves can be either calculated using “ab-
initio” methods, or reconstructed through the Rydberg–
Klein–Rees (RKR) [22, 23, 24] method according to ex-
perimental spectroscopic data. As modern spectroscopy
is able to resolve line positions to less than the cm−1,
level energies can be known to a greater accuracy than
using “ab-initio” methods. However, “ab-initio” methods
are able to reproduce the entire potential curve, whereas
the RKR method can only yield the region of the poten-
tial curve where measured data is available. To overcome
this problem, the central part of the potential curve cal-
culated through the RKR method is extrapolated by a re-
pulsive potential at narrower internuclear distances, and
by a Hulburth and Hirschfelder [25] potential at larger
internuclear distances, provided that the state dissocia-
tion energy is know. This method can only be applied
for electronic states with a single potential with a shape
close to a well, but this is fortunately the case for most
of the electronic states for the molecules encountered in

culation of potential curves and vibronic wavefunctions
can be found in [26]. An example of a calculation of po-
tential curves (using the RKR method) and vibrational

2.3 Simulation of Linear Polyatomic
Rovibrational Spectra Using the
Line-by-Line Approach

Calculations for linear polyatomic species present
further diﬃculties compared to diatomic species, as
molecules have several vibration modes (bending, sym-
metric/asymmetric stretch, etc...). Emission spectra from
these molecules results mainly from rovibrational transi-
tions, and a set of vibrational equilibrium constants can
still be deﬁned, with a more complex formulation (an ex-
ample for the CO2 molecule is presented in [27]). How-
ever, estimation of these vibrational parameters is rather
diﬃcult, the resulting values giving inaccurate results in
some cases. In practice, a set of band-origin wavelengths
and rotational constants for each vibrational transition is
given, allowing the calculation of the line positions.

The calculation of the lines intensities follows a similar
approach than for diatomic spectra calculations. Emis-
sion coeﬃcients of rovibrational transitions of polyatomic
spectra can be expressed through an expression similar to
Eq. 3:

εν =

1
4π

Nv′J ′ Av′v′′ Sℓ

ℓ′′J ′′ FJ ′J ′′ hν

′

′

J

(15)

Where the additional

term FJ ′J ′′ designates

the
Herman-Wallis factor, which accounts for vibration-
rotation interactions (see p. 110 in [28]). This factor has
been omitted from Eq. 3, as vibration-rotation interac-
tions can be usually neglected in a rovibronic transition,
owing to the usually large energy gap between the tran-
sition electronic levels. However, for rovibrational tran-
sitions, this interaction has to be accounted for, which
explains it’s inclusion in Eq. 15.

The vibrational Einstein coeﬃcient is related to the vi-
brational transition moment squared ℜv′v′′ through the
relation equivalent to Eq. 12 for linear polyatomic rovi-
brational transitions:

Determination of this squared transition moment ℜv′v′′
is rather complex.
Instead, values of the integrated in-
tensity of a vibrational band are tabulated at a refer-
ence temperature T0 (usually 296 K) [29]. The value for
the vibrational dipole moment (in atomic units squared
(ea0)2) can then be deduced from the following expression

2.4 Line Shapes Calculations

The accuracy to the exact expression being within 1 %.

Line broadening mechanisms are grouped into two cate-
gories: pressure broadening including natural, resonance,
van der Waals, and collisional broadening mechanisms.
Pressure broadening is represented by a Lorentzian pro-
ﬁle for a given full width at half maximum (FWHM) ∆¯νL,
and Doppler broadening is represented by a Gaussian pro-
ﬁle for a given FWHM ∆¯νG. A discussion on these dif-
ferent broadening mechanisms can be found in [32].

A simple modiﬁcation to the Voigt FWHM expression

ever, many other methods exist for the calculation of a
Voigt lineshape. An overview and discussion for these
diﬀerent methods can be found in [34].

2.5 Strategies for Fast and Accurate

Spectral Simulations

Spectral calculations using the line-by-line approach
can lead to large calculation times, as several thousands
of lines are typically calculated and convoluted with the
corresponding lineshapes. Also, such calculations can re-
turn spectral grids which can be several million points
wide. Therefore, some techniques may be used in order
to reduce the number of calculated lines. A good way
to achieve this consists in making some approximations
regarding the ﬁne-structure (spin-splitting eﬀects) of the
simulated spectra. This ﬁne structure can in some cases
be entirely or partially neglected resulting in lesser com-
puted lines.

2.5.2 Reducing the number of simulated rotational

Taking into account the eﬀects of spin-splitting in cal-
culations of the ﬁne structure for multiplet transitions
leads to the determination of up to 12 and 27 rotational
branches for doublet and triplet transitions respectively
instead of the 3 usual P, Q and R branches. This re-
sults in calculation times increased by a factor of 4 and
9 respectively. Therefore, one may want to neglect spin-
splitting in order to reduce computation times, but with-
out losing precision in the calculation result. One needs
then to evaluate the importance of line spin-splitting over
the line resolution (which depends on the lines FWHM).
If the separation of multiplet lines is much smaller than
their widths, such lines will be accurately modelled by
one singlet line.

This approach is usually valid for multiplet Σ states,
which have small spin-splitting factors allowing transi-
tions between such states to be accurately modelled as
singlet states.

A good example can be given for a 2Σ −2 Σ transition.
For this case, the separation between two doublet lines
(in ˚A) is given by:

∆λ ≃ 108 (γE − γG)(J + 1
2 )

¯ν 2
0

(20)

For the CN violet system3, this is equivalent to a line
splitting of 0.14 ˚A for a rotational value as high as J=100.
In classical spectrometry applications, this transition can
be accurately simulated as a singlet transition, reducing
calculation times without a loss of accuracy. For triplet Σ
transitions, a slightly more complicated relationship can
also be determined to evaluate whether the analyzed tran-
sitions can be accurately modelled as singlet transitions
(according to the transition γ and λ constants).

The limits of this assumption occur when the spin-
splitting of the studied states is no more negligible, and
self-absorption of the spectra is high. In this case, a com-
parison of a simulated spectrum using this simpliﬁcation
with a simulated spectrum accounting for spin-splitting
shows non-negligible diﬀerences [18]. However, even for
multiplet states with larger spin-splitting values such as
Π and ∆, the same approach may still be valid for lower
resolution spectra (with line widths of about 1–10 ˚A or
higher).

3 the spin-spin correction is γ = 7.26 · 10−3cm−1 for the
(X2Σ,v=0) state, and γ = 17.16 · 10−3cm−1 for the (B2Σ,v=0)
state [35]

branches

Even when spin-splitting eﬀects need to be accounted
for in spectral simulations, one may still reduce the num-
ber of calculated rotational branches making use of cer-
tain simpliﬁcations.

The ﬁrst case occurs for perpendicular transitions be-
tween Σ and Π states when neglecting the spin-splitting
of the Σ state using the approach described in section
(2.5.1) leads to the superposition of several branches.

As an example, for 2Σ ↔2 Π doublet and for 3Σ ↔3 Π
triplet transitions 4 and 10 satellite branches respectively
coalesce with the main branches when neglecting spin-
splitting of the Σ state.

The second case occurs for calculations of high tem-
perature spectra in applications such as combustion or
plasma radiation in which some branches have small in-
tensities and can be neglected.

Energy exchanges between the diﬀerent rotational
states (R-R transfer) are very eﬃcient which means that
in most of the spectroscopic applications of interest, a
Boltzmann distribution of these states may be assumed.
Therefore, a line rotational intensity may be written as

(2J + 1) exp

− hc

kTrot F (J)

S(J) =

(cid:16)
Qrot

SΛ
J
Λ′′J ′′
2J + 1

(cid:17)

(21)

as each rotational state has a gJ = 2J + 1 degeneracy,
the ground state will not be the most populated state.
As an example, at room temperature, typically the most
populated rotational level is around J = 7 − 10, whereas
at a 2000 K temperature, the most populated level is
around J = 20.

This is an advantage for the simulation of high temper-
ature gases radiation as the rotational transition prob-
abilities (Honl-London factors) for some branches have
smaller magnitudes than others, only reaching equivalent
magnitudes for the ﬁrst rotational levels (typically J ≤ 5).
If we take into account the fact that those levels are not
the most populated according to what was said before, it
can be veriﬁed that the peak rotational line strengths of
such branches are typically more than one order of mag-
nitude smaller than the peak rotational strengths of other
branches. An example for a 3Σ ↔3 Π transition at a 300
K gas temperature is presented in Fig. 2

The ratio of the peak intensities between the second
and ﬁrst group of rotational branches is 3.3 for this case.

taken from [16]. The corresponding weak branches
(group 1) are listed in appendix B

For a 2000 K temperature, the same calculation results
in a 15.8 ratio. Therefore omitting such weaker rota-
tional branches for spectral calculations of high temper-
ature gases has in most cases a negligible eﬀect on the
simulated spectra.

Branches than can be neglected and coalesced branches
when the spin-splitting of Σ states in perpendicular tran-
sitions is neglected are presented in appendix B for dou-
blet and triplet transitions between Σ and Π states.

3 Examples of Molecular Radiation
Simulation in the Line-by-Line
Approach

Some applications of the diﬀerent methods for the cal-
culation of line positions are presented in this section.
Speciﬁc spectra is numerically reproduced, and the appli-
cability of each of these methods is discussed. The ex-
perimental data presented here has been recorded at high
resolution in low pressure plasma facilities, using emission
spectroscopy techniques.

3.1 Experimental Setup

The molecular spectra presented in this study is issued
from two similar low-pressure facilities where strongly
emissive plasmas are obtained. The two facilities are lo-
cated at the CORIA Laboratory in Rouen and the Labo-
ratoire d’A´erothermique in Orl´eans respectively, both lab-
oratories from the Centre National de la Recherche Sci-
entiﬁque in France. Speciﬁc molecular systems were ac-
quired using emission spectroscopy techniques, with typ-
ical resolutions of 0.3–0.5 ˚A.

3.1.1 The SR5 Arc-jet Plasma Wind-tunnel

The SR5 low pressure arc-jet plasma wind-tunnel avail-
able at the Laboratoire d’A´erothermique has been used
during the last years for the simulation of the entry con-
ditions in Earth, Mars, and Titan planetary atmospheres
[36].

A D.C. vortex-stabilized arc operating at low voltages
(50–100 V) and low currents (50–150 A) delivers typical
powers of 5–10 kW to the ﬂow in the throat region of
the nozzle. The low mass-ﬂow rates (0.1–0.5 g/s) cross-
ing the nozzle allow the obtention of an high-enthalpy
(5–30 MJ/kg) steady plasma jet with a global yield of 50-
70%. This level of speciﬁc enthalpy obtained with a small
mass-ﬂow rate is an advantage because of the low elec-
trode erosion, which allows maintaining a steady plasma
jet for several hours with a low level of contamination.
The pumping system capacity of 26.000 m3 h−1 ensures
an ambient pressure of about 10 Pa to be maintained in a
4.3 m long and 1.1 m diameter vacuum chamber in which
the arc jet is expanded.

Spectral measurements were carried using a SOPRA
F1500 (Ebert-Fastie type) monochromator with a focal
length of 1500 mm and a grating of 1800 grooves/mm
sweeping a spectral region from 270 nm in the near-
ultraviolet region to 950 nm in the near-infrared region.
The grating is connected to an intensiﬁed optical multi-
channel analyser (Princeton Instruments IRY 1024). This
device allows a 8.5-nm wavelength region to be expanded
on 1024 pixels and is cooled by a Peltier element insuring
an operating temperature of -35◦C. The plasma is imaged
onto the monochromator by a mirror telescope connected
to the entrance slit by a quartz optical ﬁber. The en-
trance slit opening can be adjusted, therefore modifying
the experimental apparatus function which can reach val-
ues down to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
0.03 nm.

3.1.2 The CORIA Inductively Coupled Plasma Torch

The CORIA inductively coupled plasma (ICP) torch
is used for diﬀerent research ﬁelds such as plasma de-
pollution applications as well as the investigation of
plasma radiation from the vacuum ultraviolet to the in-
frared regions [37].

The facility includes a high frequency (1.76 MHz) gen-
erator, with typical voltages and intensities around 7 kV
and 10 A respectively, producing an electromagnetic ﬁeld
onto a ﬁve ﬁngers coil surrounding a quartz chamber in
which a test gas is inserted. The typical mass ﬂow rates
of 1–5 g/s, for a delivered power of about 70 kW/s and
a global yield of around 30 % lead to the formation of
a high enthalpy (around 10 MJ/kg) stable and homoge-
neous plasma. Further, a convergent nozzle can be added
between the torch and a 1 m long and 0.5 m diameter test-
chamber in which measurements can be implemented.

UV and visible spectra of air plasmas is acquired using
an Acton Research spectrometer of 750 mm focal length
implemented with a Princeton IMAX Intensiﬁed camera
allowing spectral resolutions up to 0.045 nm.

3.2 Presented Examples

An investigation has been carried on the numerical re-
production of molecular spectra from the CN Violet Sys-
tem ∆v = 0, the C2 Swan Bands ∆v = 0, and the N+
2
First Negative System ∆v = 0. Each of these systems
have been investigated previously [26, 38] and diﬃculties
linked to the numerical description of such spectra have
motivated their selection for a discussion in this work.

3.2.1 The CN Violet System

Conducting spectral measurements of line positions in
low pressure and temperature gases and plasmas allows
a precise and unambiguous line position determination,
as broadening mechanisms (principally doppler broaden-
ing, which is temperature dependent) will be kept to a
strict minimum. However, compared to higher tempera-
ture measurements, only the lower energy vibronic states
will be excited, and less lines will be measured. There-
fore, the interpolation of such line positions through the
usual polynomial expressions will only be exactly valid
for the lower vibrational and rotational levels. Extrapo-
lation of such polynomial expansions to higher levels will
of course be risky, specially taking into account the strong
oscillations of the higher terms of such expansions. Con-
sequently, a good balance between the accuracy of the

line positions determination and the number of measured
lines has to be achieved.

The CN Violet system is a strong radiative emitter in
most air and carbon species plasmas. Therefore, it has
been extensively studied by diﬀerent research teams for
over 50 years, and various sets of spectroscopic constants
have been proposed for the calculation of line positions.
Such sets have been obtained through line position mea-
surements to diﬀerent levels of precision, and to diﬀerent
temperature ranges. Namely, fourier spectroscopy tech-
niques have been applied to the measurement of this ra-
diative system over the more recent years.

Emission from the CN Violet system ∆v = 0 has been
measured in the SR5 facility for a low pressure and high
enthalpy N2–CH4 plasma, in which a Boltzmann equilib-
rium of the CN molecule rotational and vibrational levels
is achieved. The apparatus function of the measurement
system has been held at a FWHM of 1 ˚A, so as to resolve
solely the vibrational bands of the system and to allow
an easier comparison of the diﬀerent spectroscopic sets
available regarding vibrational bandheads.

The spectra has been numerically reproduced using the
set of spectroscopic constants proposed by Herzberg [28],
the set of spectroscopic constants proposed by Huber &
Herzberg [39], the set of spectroscopic constants used in
the 1985 version of the well known line-by-line spectral
code NEQAIR [40], the sets of spectroscopic constants
proposed by Cerny [41] for the X2Σ+ level and Ito [42]
for the B2Σ+ level, and ﬁnally the set of spectroscopic
constants proposed by Prasad & Bernath [35]. The tran-
sition probabilities have been taken from the set proposed
by Knowles [43]. A comparison between the measured
spectrum and the reproduced spectra, using the above
constant sets and a line shape simulating the experimen-
tal FWHM, is presented in Fig. 3.

Large discrepancies can easily be detected between the
diﬀerent simulated spectra. All the spectroscopic con-
stants reproduce to a good level of accuracy the 0–0, 1–1,
and 2–2 bandheads of the experimental spectrum. How-
ever, for higher vibrational bands, discrepancies tend to
become larger, and some simulated spectra fails to re-
produce accurately the band reversal observed in the ex-
perimental spectrum which leads to the superposition of
the 4–4 and 5–5 bandheads. Older spectroscopic constant
sets such as the ones proposed by Herzberg and Huber &
Herzberg are inadequate as they likely did not take into
account higher vibrational levels when they were devel-
oped, resulting in a limited validity range.

the simulated spectrum using the spectroscopic constants
set of the NEQAIR85 code is likely due to the truncation
to the value of ωeye for the vibrational levels polynomial
expansion (see Eq. 2a). Another example of such issues

is discussed in [5] regarding the simulation of the N2 2nd
Positive System. Care should therefore be exercised when
using spectroscopic sets with large polynomial expansions
in numerical codes which do not account for higher or-
der terms. Resorting to the truncation of available sets
may still yield correct approximations for the lower vibra-
tional levels energies, but for higher levels energies, which
are more dependant on higher order terms of such poly-
nomial expansions, this is no longer the case.
Instead,
it is preferable to ﬁt the initial polynomial expansion to
a lower order polynomial expansion, using the validity
range of the initial ﬁt for the level energies calculations.

rectly the 4–4 and 5–5 bandhead superposition. How-
ever, the 6–6 bandhead still does not match accurately
the experimental spectrum. Finally, the most recent spec-
troscopic constants, proposed by Prasad allow an exact
reproduction of the experimental spectrum (to the mea-
sured resolution).

3.2.2 The C2 Swan Bands

Various sets of equilibrium spectroscopic constants are
proposed by diﬀerent authors for the simulation of diﬀer-
ent diatomic spectra. For most applications, the accuracy
of such datasets is suﬃcient for carrying spectral simula-
tions, provided that an analysis of the available data is
carried and the more accurate data is selected. However,
in some minor cases equilibrium spectroscopic constants
no longer suﬃce for a correct description of measured
spectra. The frequently observed Swan Bands of the C2
molecule provide a good example for when equilibrium
spectroscopic constants fail to accurately reproduce ex-
perimental spectra.

A good starting point for the analysis of the spectro-
scopic constants for the upper and lower electronic states
of this system is given by a study from Phillips [44], which
analyzed the ﬁrst 10 vibrational levels of such states. Al-
though the vibrational levels of the a3Πu state follow the
usual monotonous evolution pattern typical of Eqs. 2a,
2b and 2c, the vibrational levels of the d3Πg state show a
consistent change of trend, starting from the vibrational
level v=5.
In this speciﬁc case, it is no longer possible
to ﬁt the level spectroscopic constants Gv, Bv, Dv, . . . to

The origin of the perturbation observed for the spec-
troscopic constants of the d3Πg electronic state, starting
from level v=5 has been investigated through an analysis
of the reconstructed potential curves of the transition and
the neighboring triplet states, using the RKR method.
Spectroscopic constants for the b3Σ−

were taken from the compilation of Huber & Herzberg
[39], and the spectroscopic constants for the c3Σ+

were taken from Ballik and Ramsay [49] who determined

method. The dashed lines represent the shape of the
d3Πg and e3Πg states potential curves if the vibra-

section of the potential curves is not accounted for

the usual polynomial expansions. A ﬁt of the rotational
constants Bv provided by Phillips to the ﬁfth order poly-
nomial expansion of Eq. 2b has been carried for both the
electronic levels, and the interpolated values for Bv are
compared to the initial values in Fig. 4.

It can be easily veriﬁed that, although the values of Bv
for the a3Πu electronic state can be exactly reproduced by
a polynomial expansion, this is no longer the case for the
d3Πg electronic state where the mathematical expression

An analysis of the curve plots show that the perturba-
tion of the d3Πg electronic state could be explained by
the crossing of the b3Σ−
g potential curve which occurs at
v=5. However for such cases, the perturbation would re-
main local, and higher vibrational levels of the d3Πg state
would remain unperturbed, which is not the case. There-
fore, the more probable cause for this perturbation could
result from an avoided intersection between the d3Πg and

3 Examples of Molecular Radiation Simulation in the Line-by-Line Approach

12

e3Πg potential curves (see p. 295 in [28]), which alters the
curve shape above the perturbation.

Dashed curve lines have been added to the plot to show
the avoided intersection between the potential curves.
The reconstruction of the unperturbed potential curve
for the d3Πg electronic state has proceeded including
solely the unperturbed levels v=0–4 in the RKR calcu-
lation. The extrapolation of the potential curve by a
Hulburth and Hirschﬁlder expression has taken into ac-
count a higher dissociation level [C(3P)+C(1D)]. The re-
construction of the e3Πg electronic state potential curve
has proceeded identically, taking into account a lower dis-
sociation level [C(3P)+C(3P)].

An experimental spectrum from the C2 Swan Bands
∆v=0, obtained in the CORIA ICP torch for a low pres-
sure CO2–N2–Ar plasma ﬂow, has been simulated using
the level constants proposed by Phillips, and their inter-
polation to equilibrium constants. The transition proba-
bilities used in the calculation are issued from Cooper [45].
The comparison of the simulated spectra, using level and
equilibrium spectroscopic constants to the experimental
spectrum is presented in Fig. 6.

As it could be expected after the analysis of the ﬁts
presented in Fig. 4, it is veriﬁed that equilibrium con-
stants, although ﬁtted to very accurate level constants,
fail to reproduce exactly the experimental spectrum. This
is particularly apparent for the 1–1 bandhead at 5120 ˚A,
which is not very well reproduced unlike the spectrum is-
sued from level spectroscopic constants. Therefore, when-
ever vibrational perturbations are present for any of the
states of the radiative transition, it is likely that the ex-
plicit insertion of level spectroscopic constants in simu-
lation codes will be a required feature for a suﬃciently
accurate simulation.

3.2.3 The N+

2 First Negative System

A ﬁnal example can be presented for a spectrum af-
fected by rotational perturbations of it’s internal states
(intersection of potential curves for J 6= 0). For this case,
there is a shift of the nearby levels populations following
a mathematical expression of the type 1/x (see p. 283 in
[28]). The more accurate but more complex method for
accounting for the presence of such perturbations consists
in solving the perturbative hamiltonian for the system [6].
However, in our case, it was chosen to resort to the usual
Klein–Dunham coeﬃcients for the calculation of the level

spectrum measured in an air (0.2 g/s, 4.6 kW total
power, 2.4 kW injected power, 4.4 Pa background
pressure) plasma in the SR5 facility and simulated
spectra with and without the simulation of perturba-
tions. The molecule vibrational and rotational tem-
peratures were iteratively set in the calculation un-
til a best ﬁt was achieved. The spectrometer ap-
paratus function was determined using a mercury
calibration lamp. The diﬀerent parameters read:
FWHM=0.33 ˚A, Tv = 4000 ± 100 K, Tr = 2600 ± 100 K

The analysis of the simulated spectra allows detecting
large discrepancies due to the presence of perturbations.
Namely, the structure of the 0–0 vibrational band is com-
pletely altered by the perturbations of the upper levels
energies. The eﬀects of the perturbations in the simu-
lated spectrum are very apparent near 3900 ˚A. It can be
veriﬁed that the simpliﬁed model used for including the
eﬀects of perturbations in the level energies allows ob-
taining a very close match to the experimental spectrum.
This is no longer the case for the unperturbed spectrum,

which fails to reproduce correctly the experimental spec-
trum, although accurate level spectroscopic constants are
used in the calculation.

4 Conclusion

The methods and issues regarding line-by-line spectral
calculations have been discussed in this paper. Accurate
methods for calculating the main parameters of bound
radiation such as line positions, intensities, and shapes,
have been presented for diatomic rovibronic transitions,
and linear polyatomic rovibratinal transitions.

Moreover, as line-by-line molecular simulations lead to
the calculation of spectrums composed from a very large
number of lines, with arising issues regarding computa-
tion times and memory limitations, strategies leading to
a reduction in the number of calculated lines, with minor
accuracy losses, have been presented.

A more complete discussion on the diﬀerent methods
available for the calculation of line positions has also
been carried. Additionally to the necessity of selecting
the most adapted method for the calculation of line po-
sitions, the importance of selecting the most accurate
and adapted spectral dataset has been highlighted.
It
has been showed that coping with the speciﬁc issues of
the simulation of unperturbed but also perturbed spectra
may allow reaching simulated spectra that matches very
accurately experimentally determined spectra. Moreover,
achieving such accuracies in spectral simulations also re-
sults in a very suitable method for determining vibra-
tional and rotational temperatures Tv and Tr to a good
level of accuracy. The methods which were applied to the
simulation of the presented experimental spectra have al-
lowed determining the vibrational and rotational temper-
atures to an accuracy of 100 K. Even when a Boltzmann
equilibrium is not achieved for such levels, such methods
can be successfully applied to the determination of the
levels population distributions [53].

the corresponding Lie algebraic methods in diﬀerent problems in Geometric Optics.

Abstract

1 Introduction: Symplectic and Presymplectic geometry

Geometric techniques have been applied to physics for more than 50 years in many diﬀerent ways
and they have provided powerful methods of dealing with classical problems from a new geometric
perspective. Linear representations of groups, vector ﬁelds, forms, exterior diﬀerential calculus,
Lie groups, ﬁbre bundles, connections and Riemannian Geometry, symmetry and reduction of
diﬀerential equations, etc..., are now well established tools in modern physics. Now, after more
than twenty years of using Lie algebraic mehods in Optics by Dragt, Forest, Sternberg, Wolf and
their coworkers, we aim here to establish the appropriate geometric setting for Geometric Optics.
Applications in computation of aberrations for diﬀerent orders will also be pointed out.

The basic geometric structure for the description of classical (and even quantum) systems is
that of symplectic manifold. A symplectic manifold is a pair (M, ω) where ω is a nondegenerated
closed 2-form in M. If ω is exact we will say that (M, ω) is an exact symplectic manifold . Let
1(M) be given by ˆω(X) = i(X) ω, ˆω(X)Y = ω(X, Y ). The two–form ω is said to
ˆω : X(M) →
be nondegenerate when ˆω is a bijective map. Then M is evendimensional and it may be used to
identify vector ﬁelds on M with 1–forms on M. Vector ﬁelds XH corresponding to exact 1–forms
dH are called Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. The 2–form ω is said to be closed if dω = 0.

The simplest example is R2n with coordinates (q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn) endowed with the constant
n
i=1 dqi ∧dpi. Closedness of ω is very important because Darboux theorem establishes
2-form ω =
that for any point u ∈ M there exists a local chart (U, φ) such that if φ = (q1, . . . , qn; p1, . . . , pn),
n
i=1 dqi ∧ dpi. Consequently, the example above is the local prototype of a symplectic
then ω|U =
manifold.It is also well known that if Q is the conﬁguration space of a system, its cotangent bundle,
q Q, called phase space, is endowed with a canonical 1–form θ on T ∗Q such that
T ∗Q =
(T ∗Q, −dθ) is an exact symplectic manifold. More especiﬁcally, if (q1, . . . , qn) are coordinates in
Q then (q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn) are coordinates in T ∗Q and θ =

A Hamiltonian dynamical systems is a triplet (M, ω, H) where M is a diﬀerentiable manifold,
ω ∈ Z 2(M) is a symplectic form in M and H ∈ C ∞(M) is a function called Hamiltonian. The

and the same expression is valid in Darboux coordinates for any Hamiltonian dynamical sys-
tem.A Poisson bracket can be introduced in a symplectic manifold (M, ω) by {F, G} = XGF =
ω(XF , XG). Then, closedness of ω is equivalent to Jacobi identity for P.B. Moreover, it may be
shown that σ = ˆω−1 ◦ d : C ∞(M) → X(M) is a Lie algebra homomorphism.

A presymplectic manifold is a pair (M, ω) such that M is a diﬀerentiable manifold and ω is
a constant rank closed 2–form in M. The kernel of ω deﬁnes an integrable distribution (because
dω = 0) and when the set of leaves is a manifold, it can be endowed with a symplectic structure.
This process is called reduction of the presymplectic structure.

Very interesting examples of HDS are those deﬁned by regular Lagrangians, (T Q, ωL, EL),
with ωL = −dθL = −d(dL ◦ S), EL = ∆L − L. More accurately, the geometric approach to the
Lagrangian description makes use of the geometry of the tangent bundle of the conﬁguration space
that we will shortly review. The tangent bundle τQ: T Q → Q is characterized by the existence
of a vector ﬁeld generating dilations along the ﬁbres, called Liouville vector ﬁeld, ∆∈X(T Q), and
the vertical endomorphism which is a (1, 1)–tensor ﬁeld S in T Q that in a natural coordinate
system for T Q, induced from a chart in Q, are ∆ = vi∂/∂vi, and S = (∂/∂vi) ⊗ dqi. Given a
1(T Q) by θL = dL◦ S. When the exact 2–form
function L ∈ C ∞(T Q), we deﬁne the 1–form θL ∈
ωL = −dθL is nondegenerate the Lagrangain L is called regular and then (T Q, ωL) is a symplectic
manifold. The energy function EL is given by EL = ∆(L) − L. The coordinate expressions are
θL = (∂L/∂vi)dqi and EL = vi(∂L/∂vi) − L.

2 Symplectic structures in Geometric Optics

The set of oriented geodesics of a Riemannian manifold can be endowed with a symplectic structure
and in particular the set of oriented straightlines in the plane, which is the set of light rays in a
two–dimensional constant rank medium, can be endowed with a symplectic structure. Moreover,
it can be considered as the cotangent bundle of the one–dimensional sphere S1. If an origin O
has been chosen in the plane, every oriented straightline that does not pass through the point O
is characterized by a unit vector s pointing in the line direction and a vector v orthogonal to s
with end on the line and origin in O. The straightlines of a pencil of oriented parallel lines are
characterized by proportional vectors v and the same s. Straightlines passing through O with
direction given by s correspond to v = 0. The vectors v and s being orthogonal and s · s = 1, the
couple (s, v) can be seen as a tangent vector to the unit circle S1 at the point described by s.

The Riemannian metric in S1 can be used to identify in each point s the tangent space TsS1 with
s S1 and therefore the tangent bundle T S1 with the cotangent bundle T ∗S1. This
its dual space T ∗
identiﬁcation shows us that the space of oriented straightlines in the Euclidean two–dimensional
space can be endowed with an exact symplectic structure which corresponds to the canonical
structure for the cotangent bundle T ∗S1. The study of oriented straightlines in Euclidean three–
dimensional space follows a similar pattern.

A choice of coordinates in the base space will provide us Darboux coordinates: a good choice
will be an angle coordinate. A straightline y = m x+ b with slope m = tan θ will be represented by

a vector orthogonal to the vector s = (cos θ, sin θ), and length b cos θ, namely, v = b cos θ ∂
∂θ . The
vector ∂/∂θ is unitary in the Euclidean metric, and then the point (θ, pθ) ∈ T ∗S1 corresponding to
(θ, vθ) is pθ = vθ. The symplectic form in T S1 translated from the canonical symplectic structure
in T ∗S1 ω0 = dθ ∧ dpθ will be ω = dθ ∧ d(b cos θ) = d(sin θ) ∧ db. Therefore, Darboux coordinates
for ω adapted to the cotangent structure are not only (θ, b cos θ) but also q = sin θ, p = b, which
are more appropriate from the experimental viewpoint. So, the ﬂat screens arise here as a good
choice for Darboux coordinates.

The choice usually done in Geometric Optics is s · s = n2, the Darboux coordinate q then being
q = n sin θ. This leads to the image of the Descartes sphere, a sphere of radius n whose points
describe the ray directions. In the more general case of a variable refractive index, we recall that
light rays trajectories in Geometric Optics are determined by Fermat’s principle: the ray path
connecting two points is the one making stationary the optical length: δ

γ n ds = 0.

This corresponds to the well–known Hamilton’s principle of Classical Mechanics with an “op-
z , which is a diﬀerentiable function in T R3 up to the zero
tical Lagrangian” L = n
section. In other words, the mechanical problem corresponding to Fermat’s principle leads to a
singular Lagrangian L(q, v) = [g(v, v)]1/2, where g is a metric conformal to the Euclidean met-
ric g0, g(v, w) = n2g0(v, w). L is an homogeneous function of degree one in the velocities and
consequently L is singular and the corresponding energy function vanishes identically.

R

It was shown in [1] that it is possible to relate the solutions of the Euler–Lagrange equations
for L with those of the regular Lagrangian L = 1
2L2, up to a reparametrization. L is quadratic in
velocities and the solution ΓL of the equation i(ΓL)ωL = dEL = dL is not only a second order
diﬀerential equation vector ﬁeld but also a spray, the projection onto R3 of its integral curves being
the geodesics of the Levi–Civita connection deﬁned by g. The kernel of ωL is two–dimensional
and it is generated by ΓL and the Liouville vector ﬁeld ∆. The distribution ker ωL is integrable
because dωL = 0; the distribution is also generated by ∆ and K = 1

v3 ΓL, for which [∆, K] = 0.

If the refractive index for an optical system depends only on x3 and the region in which the
index is not constant is bounded, we can choose Darboux coordinates by ﬁxing a x3 outside
this region and taking Darboux coordinates for the corresponding problem of constant index [2].
This justify the choice of coordinates for the ingoing and outgoing light rays in the constant index
media, i.e. it shows the convenience of using ﬂat screens in far enough regions on the left and right
respectively, and then this change of Darboux coordinates seems to be, from an active viewpoint,
a canonical transformation. Similar results can be obtained (see [3]) for nonisotropic media for
which the refractive index depends only on the ray direction, i.e. n = n(v) and ∆n = 0. The only
diﬀerence is that ωL may be singular, but in the regular case all works properly.

3 Group theoretical approximations

Mathematical expressions like x′ = f (x) admit two diﬀerent interpretations. In the alias inter-
pretation x and x′ are coordinates of the same point in two diﬀerent coordinate systems, while
in the ad libi interpretation x are the coordinates of a point and x′ those of its image under
the transformation deﬁned by f . In this sense a change of Darboux cordinates can be seen as
a canonical transformation in R2n, and in particular, when Darboux coordinates are chosen as
indicated above, the passage of the set of light-rays through an optical device can be considered

as a canonical transformation. Moreover, we can split an optical system in two subsystems and
the canonical transformation factorizes as a product of two canonical transformations. Even if the
group of canonical transformations is not a Lie group, any element g can be written as the expo-
nential of an element in its Lie algebra, the set of Hamiltonian systems, g = exp Xf . Symmetry
of the optical system leads to reduction, and then to a lower number of degrees of freedom.

There exist formulae generalizing Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ for composition of generating
functions, both in an exact or approximate way. Most of approximation formulae substitute the
generating functions by a power series development and then only keep some terms, giving rise in
this way to aberrations. For instance, if we only consider quadratic terms, we will get the linear
approximation.

The fundamental algebraic ingredients for the theory of approximate groups are the concepts
of enveloping algebra U and symmetric algebra Σ of a Lie algebra g. Essentially, if {X1, . . . , Xn}
is a basis of g, then Σ is the algebra of polynomials in {X1, . . . , Xn}. Both U and Σ have
graded Lie algebra structures extending that of g, which can be identiﬁed as a subalgebra of U
In the same way as g can be seen as the set of linear functions on g∗, the symmetric
and Σ.
algebra can be considered as the set of polynomials on g∗- The adjoint action of G on g can
be extended to an action Ad : G × Σ → Σ in such way that Ad(g) is linear for each g ∈ G
and Ad(g)(p1.p2) = Ad(g)(p1).Ad(g)(p2). The extension of the adjoint action of the Lie algebra,
ad : g × g → g,

ad(a, b) = ad(a)(b) = [a, b], is the adjoint action of the symmetric algebra Σ:

ad : Σ × Σ → Σ,

ad(p1, p2) = ad(p1)(p2) = [p1, p2]Σ.

For any p ∈ Σ, we can also consider the formal transformation of Σ, φ(p) : Σ → Σ,

p′ → φ(p)(p′) = exp(ad(p))(p′) = p′ + [p, p′]Σ + 1/2[p, [p, p′]Σ]Σ + . . . ,

and we should now consider the elements p for which such expresion is meaningful. They span a
group GΣ. The enlarged action of it reduces to the identity when acting on the set ΣI = {p ∈ Σ |
[a, p]Σ = 0, ∀a ∈ g} of the polynomial Casimir elements of g. We shall then pass to the quotient
graded Lie algebra ΣC = Σ/ΣI. Finally for approximation we will consider for each r ∈ N the
t>r Σt, and then φ([p])Hr ⊂ Hr, and therefore it induces a map Φr([p]).

Perturbative treatment of aberrating optical systems
using Weyl group

1, ν′ + ν + 1

A model for geometrical optics in a plane is obtained from the Weyl group W (1): it is a three–
dimensional Lie group, with elements g ∈ W (1) labelled by g = (µ1; ν), µ1 ∈ R2, ν ∈ R, and
composition law g′g = (µ1 + µ′

1 ∧ µ1) where ∧ denotes (a, b) ∧ (c, d) = ad − bc.
2b ∂ν, P = ∂b − 1

A basis for the Lie algebra w(1), is given by Q = ∂a − 1

2a ∂ν, I = ∂ν with Lie
brackets [Q, I] = [P, I] = 0, [Q, P ] = I. An inﬁnite-dimensional basis for the associated symmetric
algebra Σ is given by {1, I, Q, P, I 2, IQ, IP, Q2, QP, P 2, . . .}. φ(λ1I + λ2Q + λ3P ) is in fact an
element of G. Its generalized adjoint action on Σ preserves each subspace Σr. It is enough to
know its action on Σ1, (c1I + c2Q + c3P → ((c1 − λ3c2 + λ2c3)I + c2Q + c3P ). Another typical
element of GΣ is given by φ(ν1I 2 + ν2IQ + ν3IP + ν4Q2 + ν5QP + ν6P 2), which in fact is only a

2µ′

formal map. However, its projected maps on Pr are well deﬁned. The inﬁnitesimal adjoint action
ad(ν1I 2 + ν2IQ + ν3IP + ν4Q2 + ν5QP + ν6P 2) maps each Σr onto Σr+1, so that only its action
on Σ1 is not trivial when considering its projected map on P2=Σ0 ⊕ Σ1 ⊕ Σ2.

The Casimir elements of w(1) are the polynomial functions on I and 1. A basis for the quo-
tient algebra ΣC is {[1]c, [Q]c, [P ]c, [Q2]c, [QP ]c, [P 2]c, . . .}. The reduction process can be obtained
by quotient by the ideal generated by the Casimir I. A typical element of the group GΣC is
φC(ν1[Q2]c + ν2[QP ]c + ν3[P 2]c). Its projected action on PC

5 Example

In the design of a doublet we have seven of these basic systems concatenated so that the total
system (chosen to be telescopic) is obtained in third order approximation by composition formulae
of the corresponding third order aberration group. The composition of the systems (M2, µ2)
and (M1, µ1), with Mi the linear approximation matrices and µi the coeﬃcients of the fourth
order polynomials, is obtained by the formula (M2M1, D4(M −1
1 )µ2 + µ1), D4(M) being the former
representation of matrix M on the fourth order polynomial space. In our example, a concatenation
of compositions for the doublet gives way to a total linear approximation matrix (on which we can
impose the telescopic condition γ = 0 and a given factor of magniﬁcation, say δ = 5) and a total
fourth order polynomial. Fixing the refractive indexes of the lenses as n1 = 7/4 and n2 = 9/4 we
obtain a seven parameter system of equations. The polynomic expression of µ in terms of Si and
zj (the radii and lengths of the lenses) is a set of eleven to sixteen degree polynomials, so that
numerical calculus should be used to obtain solutions with zero third order aberrations.

The example does not try to be a realistic design, in which a four dimensional space should be
used on the q’s and p’s, chromatic aberration should be taken into account through the dependence
on the refractive index with the wave length, and stability of the solution to errors on the param-
eters should be considered. For our playing design system, and in order to simplify the calculus,
we can ﬁx some of the parameters in terms of the other ones, say S2 = S3 = z1/4, z3 = z1 and
z2 = 2z1, so that only three parameters are left free. Taking into account the telescopic condition
and the given factor of magniﬁcation we are left with just one parameter, which can be used to
minimize the square of the µ vector.

A numerical solution obtained for this simpliﬁed case is z1 = 0.5925, which gives a linear

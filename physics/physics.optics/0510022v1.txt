For some years, spectroscopic data from diatomic molecules commonly found in low-pressure plasmas and
planetary atmospheres has been compiled in order to improve the knowledge of the spectral properties of
such mixtures. Up to very recently, the only available reference was provided by Huber and Herzberg’s classic
book on the constants of diatomic molecules [1]. Since then, two diﬀerent Web-based databases, DiRef [2]
and RADEN [3], provided compilations of references associated with the spectra of diatomic molecules, the
latter already providing a limited amount of numerical data.

The GPRD (Gas and Plasma Radiation Database) database moves a step further, as it provides fac-
tual data – level-dependent spectroscopic constants, Klein–Dunham coeﬃcients, Franck–Condon factors and
r-centroids, electronic and vibronic transition moments, oscillator absorption strengths and Einstein coeﬃ-
cients, level-dependent and overall cross-sections for continuum transitions – and its associated references,
allowing the user to simulate the relevant rovibronic transitions of the database diatomic molecules.

Although this database provides the scientiﬁc community with a novel and yet unique tool for retrieving
the overall spectral properties of diatomic molecules rovibronic transitions, otherwise missing spectroscopic
data is also provided for the simulation of atomic continuum radiation. The database is also linked to the
most preeminent databases on atomic radiation (providing data on discrete and photoionization radiation
processes) [4, 5]. Finally, vibrationally-dependent spectroscopic data for the simulation of discrete and
continuum transitions is also provided for small polyatomic molecules (this is currently limited to the CO2
molecule). The proposed data can be considered as complementary of data provided by the HITRAN [6]
database, regarding the simulation of the spectral properties for high-temperature gases and plasmas.

The GPRD database can be accessed online at the internet address http://cfp.ist.utl.pt/radiation/. This
database is freely available to the overall scientiﬁc community, and only requires electronic registration in
order to provide full access to the overall web-based data. The database follows a tree structure in which
the user ﬁrstly chooses among atomic and molecular data, then selects the speciﬁc chemical species, and
ﬁnally selects the type of required data (rovibronic levels, bound-bound, bound-free or free-free transitions
calculations). The author has ﬁnally to chose which spectroscopic parameters he wants to retrieve (Klein–
Dunham, Einstein coeﬃcients, etc... ), and is provided with a list of the available sets. The present version
of the database encompasses over 300 diﬀerent datasets and is ever growing.

The engine used in the database has been developed using the SQL language, and the user interface is
written in PHP. The spectroscopic data is provided in two diﬀerent formats. The ﬁrst one is a spreadsheet
in the XML format, which can be opened with popular software such as Excel or OpenOﬃce. A XSL/CSS
stylesheet has been added in order to allow online viewing of the spectral data. A simpliﬁed comma-separated
(.csv) text ﬁle containing the spectroscopic data is also provided. The database program is currently being
run on an Apache server.

Future updates of the database will include critical comments on the available spectroscopic data by the
database managers. Comments from the general spectroscopy community will also be accepted, in order
to allow users to select the most relevant and accurate spectroscopic data for their own needs. Moreover,
a speciﬁc section of the database, featuring experimental spectra from atomic and molecular systems, is
scheduled for development. This will allow critical comparisons between synthetic spectra (generated from
the diﬀerent available datasets) and measured spectra.

The authors would like to acknowledge F. Passarinho for his assistance and contributions in designing the page layout.

We report on the ﬁrst experimental observation of discrete gap solitons in
binary arrays of optical waveguides. We observe the soliton generation when
the inclination angle of an input beam is slightly above the Bragg angle, and
show that the propagation direction of the emerging gap soliton depends on
the input power as a result of an inter-band momentum exchange.

Nonlinear periodic photonic structures such as arrays
of optical waveguides attracted a lot of interest due to
the unique ways they oﬀer for controlling light. Periodic
modulation of the refractive index breaks the transla-
tional invariance and produces eﬀective discreteness in
a continuous system, opening up many novel possibili-
ties for manipulating light propagation, including light
localization in the form of discrete optical solitons1,2.

Recently, it was suggested that a novel type of discrete
optical solitons, the so-called discrete gap solitons, can
be generated in the binary waveguide arrays, by a single
inclined beam3 or two input beams4. The binary arrays
of optical waveguides are specially engineered photonic
structures consisting of periodically alternating wide and
narrow waveguides [see an example in Fig. 1(a)]. Dis-
crete gap solitons in such structures can be considered
as a nontrivial generalization of the spatial gap solitons
recently observed in the waveguide arrays5 and optically-
induced photonic lattices6. Gap solitons in binary ar-
rays are associated with the fundamental modes strongly
conﬁned in narrow waveguides, which lowers the power
threshold for the soliton excitation, and may result in
reduced radiation losses compared to the gap solitons
based on radiation or higher-order bound modes in the
conventional arrays.
In this Letter, we report on the
ﬁrst experimental observation of discrete gap solitons in
binary arrays of optical waveguides and demonstrate a

novel method of eﬃcient steering of gap solitons based
on the inter-band momentum exchange.

We investigate spatial beam self-action and soliton
formation in the fabricated etched arrays of the 5 mm
long AlGaAs waveguides with the eﬀective refractive in-
dex contrast 0.0035 (see Ref. 2). The binary arrays
are made of wide (4 µm) and narrow (2.5 µm) waveg-
uides with 4 µm edge-to-edge spacing, and accordingly
the full period is d =14.5µm as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
The beam propagation in this structure can be de-
scribed by the normalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, i ∂E
∂x2 + ν(x)E + |E|2E = 0, where E(x, z) is
the normalized envelope of the electric ﬁeld, x and z are
the transverse and propagation coordinates normalized
to the characteristic values xs = 1µm and zs = 1mm,
respectively, D = zsλ/(4πn0x2
s) is the beam diﬀrac-
tion coeﬃcient, n0 = 3.3947 is the average medium re-
fractive index, λ = 1.5 µm is the vacuum wavelength,
ν(x) = 2∆n(x)πn0/λ, and ∆n(x) is the eﬀective modu-
lation of the optical refractive index.

In the waveguide arrays, the wave spectrum possesses
a band-gap structure with gaps separating bands of the
continuous spectrum associated with the spatially ex-
tended Bloch waves of the form, E(x, z) = ψ(x) exp(ikx+
iβz), where the propagation constant β is proportional
to the wave-vector component along the waveguides. In

and second (dashed) bands. Fourier spectrum of an in-
put beams with 20% larger then Bragg incident angle is

Fig. 1(b), we plot the Bloch-wave dispersion curves and
mark two types of spectrum gaps appearing due to (i) to-
tal internal reﬂection and (ii) Bragg-type scattering.

When the medium nonlinearity is self-focusing, the dis-
crete gap solitons may appear near the upper edge of
the second band4. One of the distinguishing features of
such solitons is their localization at narrow waveguides,
as shown in Fig. 1(d). As was suggested in Ref. 3, the
gap solitons can be excited by an input Gaussian beam
which is inclined slightly above the Bragg angle. Each
Fourier component of an incident beam excites a super-
position of Bloch waves belonging to diﬀerent bands, ac-
cording to the values of excitation coeﬃcients Cn plotted
in Fig. 1 (see details in Ref. 7). If the input beam spans
several periods of the underlying lattice (we choose the
45 µm FWHM beam) and its spectrum is narrow, then
the excitation of the second band becomes dominant [see
Fig. 1(c)], facilitating the formation of a gap soliton. Al-
though fully controlled generation of gap solitons can be
achieved only in a two-beam excitation scheme4–6,8, the
single-beam approach is simpler to implement. Addition-

ally, the simultaneously excited Bloch waves of the ﬁrst
band move in the opposite direction, resulting in “self-
clearing” of the gap soliton, and allowing to control the
soliton velocity by changing the input beam intensity3.
We note that all Bloch-wave components tend to trap to-
gether into a multi-band breather if a normally incident
narrow beam is used9, and complex Bloch-wave interac-
tion occurs for the inclined narrow beams7.

In our experiments, ﬁrst we study the linear beam
propagation (see Ref. 2 for description of experimental
set-up). The dependence of the output ﬁeld distribution
on the input angle is shown in Fig. 2. We note that, in a
binary waveguide array, the Bloch waves corresponding
to the ﬁrst and second bands can be easily distinguished,
since they are primarily localized at wide and narrow
waveguides, respectively. We ﬁnd that the band-2 exci-
tation becomes dominant above the Bragg angle, in full
agreement with the theoretical predictions (higher bands
become excited as the angle is further increased).

Next, we analyze nonlinear self-action of beams with
the inclination angles below and above the Bragg angle,
as marked in Fig. 2. In the former case, the Bloch waves
associated with the bottom of the ﬁrst band and experi-
encing anomalous diﬀraction are primarily excited. This
results in beam self-defocusing as nonlinearity grows10.
Indeed, we register broadening of the output beam with
the increase of the laser power, see Fig. 3(a).

Strong beam self-focusing and gap-soliton formation
are observed when the input inclination angle is above
the Bragg angle [see Fig. 3(b)], and the gap solitons are
localized at narrow waveguides. Additionally, the output
soliton position depends on the input power. Numerical
results for the beam propagation [Fig. 4, top] agree well
with the experimental data. In Figs. 4(a-d) we show the
beam dynamics inside the waveguide array structure for
various input intensities. These simulations demonstrate

that the soliton velocity and, accordingly, the soliton out-
put position are deﬁned largely at the initial stage, where
the counter-propagating Bloch waves of the ﬁrst and sec-
ond bands interact strongly with each other. This inter-
band momentum exchange is predominantly responsible
for the soliton steering, which may ﬁnd applications for
a simple realization of all-optical switching.

In conclusion, we have generated discrete gap solitons
in binary waveguide arrays and presented an experimen-
tal evidence of the inter-band momentum exchange ob-
served in the form of a power-dependent soliton steering.

We investigate for the ﬁrst time the enhancement of the stimulated Raman scattering in slow-light
Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonic crystal line defect waveguides. By applying the Bloch-Floquet
formalism to the guided modes in a planar photonic crystal, we develop a formalism that relates the
intensity of the down-shifted Stokes signal to the pump intensity and the modal group velocities. The
formalism is then applied to two prospective schemes for enhanced stimulated Raman generation in
slow-light photonic crystal waveguides. The results demonstrate a maximum factor of 104 (66,000)
enhancement with respect to SOI channel waveguides. Eﬀects of two photon absorption, intrinsic
scattering, and disorder with respect to slow-light Raman generation towards optically-pumped
silicon ampliﬁers and lasers are also discussed.

Silicon photonics has seen remarkable advancements in
recent years. Subwavelength silicon nanostructures - such
as photonic crystals and high-index-contrast photonic in-
tegrated circuits - oﬀer the opportunity to manipulate
the propagation of light at sub-wavelength scales. More-
over, the inherent ease of integrating the silicon photonics
platform with CMOS foundry ICs oﬀers unprecedented
bandwidth per unitcost and distance in optical data com-
munications.

Silicon, however, is at an intrinsic disadvantage for op-
tical ampliﬁcation and lasing due to its indirect band
gap and non-existent second order nonlinear response.
Recent work has demonstrated that stimulated Raman
scattering (SRS) in single-crystal silicon channel waveg-
uides is a feasible means to achieve ampliﬁcation and
lasing via optical pumping1,2,3,4,5. This is due to the
intrinsically large Raman gain coeﬃcient in silicon (be-
ing 103 to 104 times greater than for silica) and sili-
con nanostructures oﬀering the beneﬁt of high optical
conﬁnement due to high-index contrast of silicon with
air or silicon oxide. While still requiring an optical
pump and possessing limited gain bandwidth, enhanced
SRS through slow-light silicon photonic crystal waveg-
uides (PhCWG) can serve as an ultra-compact on-chip
gain media at desired telecommunications frequencies.
Enhanced Raman scattering has been observed in bulk
hollow-core slow-light guided-wave structures6 and has
also recently been suggested for photonic crystal (PhC)
defect nanocavities.7 In addition, a semiclassical model
of Raman scattering in bulk photonic crystals has been
introduced.8 In this Letter we demonstrate theoretically
for the ﬁrst time the explicit enhancement of SRS in a
slow-light PhCWG through a four wave mixing formal-
ism from the computed modes of the line-defect waveg-
uide. A silicon PhCWG studied here, made by removing
a single row in a hexagonal lattice of holes - denoted as
”W1 PhCWG” - and its projected band structure can be
seen in Fig. 1. This structure supports two tightly con-
ﬁned modes with small group velocities, as illustrated
by the two bands within the band gap, with frequen-
cies below the light line. The ﬁeld distribution of these
two modes, as computed through the plane wave expan-

sion method,9 is illustrated in Fig. 2. The strong sub-
wavelength modal conﬁnement of the high index contrast
PhCWG leads to increased ﬁeld intensities in the silicon
gain media, permitting increased nonlinear interactions.
In addition to increased ﬁeld intensities from high in-
dex conﬁnement, there is additional SRS enhancement
from the small group velocities of the PhCWG propagat-
ing modes. Physically this enhancement originates from
the eﬀective long light-matter interaction times at small
group velocities. Photon localization is observed at the
band edge; the photon experiences multiple scattering
processes and moves very slowly through the material
structure. The guided bands of a 2D PhCWG can be de-
signed to be as ﬂat as desired (vg ≡ dω/dk) for slow-light
behavior, and group velocities as low as 10−2c to 10−3c
have been demonstrated.10,11

In SRS for silicon an incident photon interacts with the
LO and TO phonons. The strongest Stokes peak arises
from the single ﬁrst-order Raman-phonon at the center of
the Brillouin zone. The generation of the Stokes photons
can be understood classically as a third order nonlinear

Stokes beams. The important material parameter is the
third order nonlinear Raman susceptibility, χR. For sili-
con, at resonance, χR is deﬁned by the components χR
ijij
= -iχR = -i11.2 × 10−18 m2 · V−2 (i, j = 1, 2, 3). An ad-
ditional symmetry, imposed by the crystal point group
(m3m for Si), is χR
ijij . These components,
and their permutations as deﬁned by the crystal point
group, deﬁne the SRS in a silicon crystal. For our pur-
pose we shall consider scattering in silicon along the [1¯10]
direction since practical devices are fabricated along this
direction due to the favorable cleaving of silicon along
this direction.

It shows an intrinsic
dependence on the polarization and the phonon selection
rules through χR, and the intensity of the pump beam
by Ip. The bulk solution also describes SRS in dielectric
waveguides, where χR
eﬀ is averaged over the waveguide
mode ﬁeld distribution.

A PhCWG presents a very diﬀerent ﬁeld distribution
than the bulk or dielectric waveguide case. As shown in
the computed modal proﬁles of Fig. 2, the mode diﬀers
from that of a conventional channel waveguide in that it
exhibits a periodic variation in the direction of propaga-
tion. We introduce the modal distribution of the pump
and Stokes modes in a Bloch-Floquet formalism,

En,kn(r, ωn) = En,kn(r, ωn) exp[ik(ωn) · r],

where n is a mode index (n = p, s), kn = k(ωn) is the
mode wave-vector, En,kn(r, ωn) is the modal distribu-
tion within a unit cell of the PhC, deﬁned in Fig. 2,
and obeys Bloch boundary condition En,kn(r + ∆, ωn) =

The ﬁnal equation, Eq. (7), shows the explicit inverse
dependence the Stokes mode ampliﬁcation has on the
group velocities of the pump and Stokes modes.

Table I shows the results of Eq. (7) as being applied
to two diﬀerent PhCWG schemes for SRS. The group
velocities are calculated from the slope of the projected
band structure. The ﬁrst (Scheme 1) involves utilizing
both the guided modes of the W1 waveguide; odd-parity
is the pump mode and even-parity is the Stokes mode.
The wavelength separation of the modes at the edge of
the Brillioun zone is matched to the LO/TO frequency
separation of the pump and Stokes beams (15.6 THz in
Si16). The second (Scheme 2) utilizes a wide bandwidth
PhCWG,17 in order for the Stokes and pump modes to
exist both in the fundamental mode and below the light
line. The arrows in Fig. 2 indicate the pump and Stokes
frequency locations for both schemes.

g vs

From the results of Table I, the Raman gain - propor-
tional to κ/vp
g - is enhanced by up to approximately
104 (Scheme 1:66,000, Scheme 2:86) times compared to
bulk Si based on a comparison of the respective group
velocities. The results in Table I also show a κ value
of the same order with a conventional SOI waveguide.14
In addition, we note a reduction in κ in Scheme 1 as
compared to Scheme 2, due to the lower modal overlap.
However, the single mode (Scheme 2) operation has the
disadvantage that only the Stokes mode, and not both
modes, are at low group velocities for enhanced SRS.

The above results highlight the beneﬁts of SRS en-
hancement through slow-light interactions in compact
PhCWG schemes. This approach can be readily ex-
tended to include two photon and bulk free carrier ab-
sorption eﬀects14 which may limit the eﬀective Raman
gain in PhCWGs. These eﬀects, in the experimental re-
alization of silicon SRS ampliﬁcation and lasing in slow-
light PhCWGs, can be surmounted with pulsed-laser
operation4 or PIN diodes5 to sweep the free-carriers.

trinsic (backscatter) reﬂection. Coupling into slow-light
modes is currently the dominant loss experimentally,
although this can in principle be reduced through
careful adiabatic coupling19 between the PhCWGs and
input/output channel bus waveguides. Moreover, with
thorough attention to fabrication disorder, reﬂection
losses in PhCWG are suggested to be comparable with
index-guided waveguides.20 These scattering losses can
thus potentially be smaller than the enhanced SRS

gain discussed, permitting the possibility for compact
silicon Raman ampliﬁers and lasers. We also note that,
for the same desired Raman gain, the device length
is signiﬁcantly reduced, by (c/vg)2, allowing compact
integration for high-density photonic circuits.

The paper examines superradiance in impurity crystals in the ﬁeld of a coherent phonon wave excited by
two ultrashort laser pulses via Raman scattering processes at the moment of preparation of the initial state of
an ensemble of emitters. It is shown that by varying the power of the excitation pulses and their mutual di-
rection of propagation, one can control the superradiance parameters and extract data on the electron-phonon
coupling constant and its anisotropy.

1. INTRODUCTION

The problem of spontaneous coherent emission (Dicke superradiance [1]) in impurity crystals taking into ac-
count the interaction of emitters, impurity particles, and thermal phonons, has been studied by a number of
researchers [2-7]. Weak emitter-phonon coupling generally leads to temperature-dependent decrease in the super-
radiance intensity [5, 6]. But with strong adiabatic electron-phonon coupling, for which the energy spectrum of
the system acquires a set of electron vibrational levels consisting of a zero phonon line and vibrational repetitions,
there is a ﬁnite probability of emission of superradiance pulses not only in the zero-phonon transition but also in
the vibronic transitions, with the intensity of these pulses, their delay times, and durations strongly depending
on the electron-phonon coupling parameter and the temperature of the sample(whose dimensions are smaller
than the radiation wavelength) [2, 7]. Similar results were obtained in Refs. 3 and 4 using Thomson model
[8],
which describes Brillouin scattering of light in a resonant medium with the participation of a single absorbed (or
emitted) phonon.

2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

Obviously, the parameters of superradiance can be eﬀectively controlled by exciting a coherent phonon wave,
say by a time-dependent Raman process, instead of exciting thermal phonons, which because of their insigniﬁcant
population are ineﬀective at low temperatures. In this case the experimental setup changes somewhat: to prepare
the initial superradiance state at time t = 0 there must be, in addition to an ultrashort pulse of frequency ω1, a
second ultrashort pulse of frequency ω2 propagating at an angle to the ﬁrst. Then, in addition to optical excitation
of impurity centers in the sample at frequencies ω1 and ω2, a coherent phonon wave is excited at the diﬀerence
frequency ω1 − ω2 = Ω, and this wave modulates the frequency of the quantum transitions of the emitters (as
in the case in which only thermal phonons participate). Changing the direction of propagation of the excitation
laser pulses and tuning the diﬀerence frequency ω1 − ω2 to resonance with diﬀerent phonon modes, one can not
only control the superradiance dynamics but also use the behavior of the characteristic superradiance parameters
to determine the features of electron-phonon coupling of localized electron states with the excited phonon modes
and the anisotropy of this coupling. Note that the role of a coherent phonon wave in the light echo phenomenon
was studied by Wilson et al.

[11] (see also Ref. 12).

We study an ensemble of optical emitters – impurity atoms or molecules imbedded in a crystal lattice. A nat-
ural approach to describing the electron states of impurity particles in resonant phenomena is to use the idealized
scheme of a two-level quantum system [1]. We assume that each such two-level system interacts with radiation
ﬁeld and the coherent phonon wave (excited in this case by ultrashort laser pump radiation). The interaction of
the quantum levels and thermal phonons can be ignored because the phonon modes of the lattice are ”frozen”
if low temperatures are used in the experimental setup. It is legitimate to study a selectively excited coherent
phonon wave by classical means, i.e., by assuming that the wave has an amplitude q, a frequency Ω, and a phase
φ.

We write the Hamiltonian of the system of optical emitters interacting with the radiation ﬁeld and the coherent

3. DERIVATION OF THE MASTER EQUATION

The statistical operator of a system described by the Hamiltonian (1) satisﬁes the Liouville equation (the
evolution of the system is studied over time intervals shorter than the time of irreversible dephasing of the
polarization of the resonant medium)

which the canonical transformation

Finding the trace in the photon-ﬁeld variables of both sides of Eq. (8), we arrive at equations for the reduced
density matrix σ = T rph[ρ′(t)], which describes the evolution of the quantum states of the impurity subsystem
only:

dτ T rph[Hint(t), [Hint(t − τ ), ρ′(t − τ )]].

Here we have used the fact that T rph([Hint(t), ρ′(0)]) = 0 which follows from the factorization of ρ′ at t = 0: it
is assumed that initially the system is prepared in a state which density matrix

ρ′(0) = σ(0)|0ih0|,

(10)

where |0ih0| is the density matrix of the radiation ﬁeld (we may assume that for the frequencies in the optical
range the radiation ﬁeld is in the vacuum state |0i with zero temperature).

Since in the case of superradiance the ﬁeld has the shortest correlation time (proportional to the reciprocal of
optical-frequency bandwidth), in a certain sense the ﬁeld can be interpreted as a reservoir for the atomic system.
The interaction of this system with such a wide band reservoir rapidly wipes out any memory of the system about
its past, with the result that the temporal behavior of the optical emitters is Markovian. This justiﬁes replacing
ρ′(t − τ ) by ρ′(t) in (9) and extending the upper limit of the τ -interval to ∞. Moreover, we assume that ρ′(t)
can be written as

ρ′(t) = σ(t)|0ih0| + ∆ρ′,

In the discussion that follows we ignore the principal part (denoted by P), which yield only a small imagi-
nary term, i.e., causes a small shift in the resonant frequency, and the nonresonant terms containing the factor
δ[ω0 + ω(k) + mΩ].

The characteristic time it takes the optical emitters to go into a coherent state is proportional to kΛk−1 (here
k...k stands for the operator’s value in frequency units) and is much longer than the period T = 2π/Ω of the rapid
harmonic ”jitter” superimposed on the less rapid evolution process of spontaneous coherent emission. Hence it
is natural to decompose the real motion, described by the density matrix σ, into slow motion averaged over the
period T and rapid ”jitter”. It is convenient to realize the decomposition procedure by employing the method of
”temporal projection” operators [13]:

where the projection operator P t performs the averaging of rapidly varying quantities over the period T . Next
we introduce the operator Qt = 1 − P t. Then the decomposition of the density matrix into the slowly and rapidly
varying parts can be written as

Successively applying the operators P tand Qt to Eq. (12), we arrive at two diﬀerential equations instead of

one [13]:

σ(t) → ˜σ(t) =

dtσ(t) ≡ P tσ(t),

σ = P tσ + Qtσ.

= −P tΛ(t)P tσ − P tΛ(t)Qtσ

= −QtΛ(t)P tσ − QtΛ(t)Qtσ

On the basis of Eq. (16) we can formally represent the solution for the rapidly varying (oscillating) part of the
density matrix in the form

Qtσ = −

dt′Qt′

Λ(t′)˜σ(t′) −

Using (17) in Eq. (15) for the slowly varying part of the density matrix, we see that the order of smallness in Λ
of the P tΛQtσ is no less than two (or no less than four in Hint), so that the term can be ignored. As a result,
averaging Eq. (12) over the ”jitter” reduces, according to (15), to averaging the operator Λ(t) over the period

This expression constitutes the most general form of the master equation for superradiance in the presence
of a coherent phonon wave. However, to use this equation that can be compared with experimental data, we
introduce a ”coarsening” procedure. The point here is that real samples containing emitters are much larger that
the radiation wavelength: k0R ≫ 1 (here k0 = ω/c and R = max|rj − rl|). Hence exp[ik · (rj − rl)] must be
averaged over the ensemble of particles. We apply a similar procedure to the factor exp[in(φj − φl)], assuming
that the phase diﬀerence δφjl = φj − φl is uniformly distributed over the interval 0 to 2π with density 1/2π. The
result of ensemble averaging,

exp[ik · (rj − rl)] ≡ Γ(|k|),

Depends on the shape of the sample, while averaging over the phase spread δφjl results in the exponential function
exp[inδφjl] being replaced by the Kronecker symbol:

δφjlexp(inδφjl) = δn,0.

(19)

Allowing for (19) and passing in (18) from the sum over k to an integral with respect to the wave vector k and a
sum over the polarization s of the photon ﬁeld,

(20)

Thus the dependence of n-phonon processes (n=1,2,...) on the randomly distributed phase shifts δφjl (with
constant density 1
2π must lead to averaging their contribution to zero when superradiance is initiated in large
samples. The entire modulation eﬀect of a coherent phonon wave on optical centers in this case resides in the
factor J 2
0 (λ/Ω), which renormalizes the electron photon coupling constant. This factor is similar to the Debye-
Waller factor, which characterizes the reduction in the unshifted component (the zero-phonon line) of an optical
transition when elastic scattering of thermal phonons is taken into account. However, in contrast to the case of
thermal phonons, a coherent phonon wave does not lead to homogeneous dephasing of the polarization of the
optical centers.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The standard form [14]of the operator part of Eq. (20) makes it possible to immediately write an (approxi-
mate) expression for the intensity I of superradiance under conditions in which all emitters are initially completely
inverted and the transverse macroscopic polarization is zero, i.e., T rp[Sz

to an increase in the time of formation of a superradiance pulse, the spreading of the pulse, and a decrease in the
peak intensity. The advantage of using a coherent phonon wave is that not only does it insure eﬀective control
over the superradiance process but it also allows extracting information about the strength of the coupling of
the electron states of the emitters and the various phonon modes thanks to the possibility of selectively exciting
these modes (and simultaneous ”freezing” of thermal phonons caused by low temperatures). These facts are
illustrated by Fig. 1, which depicts the time dependence of the intensity I for the diﬀerent values of the total
energy W of the excitation pulses. Here we have allowed for the fact that the dimensionless parameter λ/Ω can be

Figure 2 illustrates the dependence of a superradiance pulse on the electron-phonon coupling constant λ/Ω for
the ﬁxed value of W ). Obviously, in the latter case it is possible to study the anisotropy of the electron-phonon
coupling by varying the direction of propagation of the phonon wave (i.e, by changing the direction in which the
excitation laser pulses are applied).

Abstract

We report a numerical investigation of surface plasmon (SP) propagation in ordered and dis-

ordered linear chains of metal nanospheres. In our simulations, SPs are excited at one end of a

chain by a near-ﬁeld tip. We then ﬁnd numerically the SP amplitude as a function of propagation

distance. Two types of SPs are discovered. The ﬁrst SP, which we call the ordinary or quasistatic,

is mediated by short-range, near-ﬁeld electromagnetic interaction in the chain. This excitation is

strongly aﬀected by Ohmic losses in the metal and by disorder in the chain. These two eﬀects re-

sult in spatial decay of the quasistatic SP by means of absorptive and radiative losses, respectively.

The second SP is mediated by longer range, far-ﬁeld interaction of nanospheres. We refer to this

SP as the extraordinary or non-quasistatic. The non-quasistatic SP can not be eﬀectively excited

by a near-ﬁeld probe due to the small integral weight of the associated spectral line. Because of

that, at small propagation distances, this SP is dominated by the quasistatic SP. However, the

non-quasistatic SP is aﬀected by Ohmic and radiative losses to a much smaller extent than the

quasistatic one. Because of that, the non-quasistatic SP becomes dominant suﬃciently far from

the exciting tip and can propagate with little further losses of energy to remarkable distances.

The unique physical properties of the non-quasistatic SP can be utilized in all-optical integrated

photonic systems.

INTRODUCTION

Surface plasmons (SPs) are states of polarization that can propagate along metal-

dielectric interfaces or along other structures without radiative losses. Polarization in an

SP excitation can be spatially conﬁned on scales that are much smaller than the free-space

wavelength. This property proved to be extremely valuable for manipulation of light en-

ergy on subwavelength scales [1, 2], miniaturization of optical elements [3], and achieving

coherent temporal control at remarkably short times [4, 5]. SP excitations in ordered one-

dimensional arrays of nanoparticles have attracted signiﬁcant attention in recent years due

to numerous potential application in nanoplasmonics [6–10]. A periodic chain of high con-

ductivity metal nanospheres can be used as an SP wave guide - an analog of an optical

waveguide [11]. High-quality SP modes in ordered and disordered chains may be utilized

in random lasers [8]. Electromagnetic forces acting on linear chains of nanoparticles can

produce the eﬀect of optical trapping [12]. Various spectroscopic and sensing applications

have also been discussed [13–15].

In this paper we study theoretically and numerically propagation of SP excitations in

long ordered and disordered chains of nanospheres. Although, under ideal conditions, SP

excitations can propagate without loss of energy, in practical situations this is not so. There

are two physical eﬀects that can result in decay of SP excitations as they propagate along

the chain. The ﬁrst eﬀect is Ohmic losses due to the ﬁnite conductivity of the metal. The

second eﬀect is radiative losses due to disorder in the chain (scattering from imperfections).

This eﬀect is more subtle and is closely related to the phenomenon of localization. In this

paper we discuss both eﬀects and illustrate them with numerical examples.

We ﬁrst focus on decay due to Ohmic losses and show that it can be suppressed at

suﬃciently large propagation distances. The main idea is based on exploiting an exotic

non-Lorentzian resonance in the chain which originates due to radiation-zone interaction

of nanoparticles [13, 16] and can not be understood within the quasistatics, even when

both the nanoparticles in the chain and the inter-particle spacing are much smaller than

the wavelength. From the spectroscopic point of view, the non-Lorentzian resonances are

manifested by very narrow lines in extinction spectra [13, 14]. One of the authors (V.A.M.)

has argued previously that the small integral weight of the spectral lines associated with these

resonances precludes them from being excited by a near-ﬁeld probe [16]. This property would

2

make the non-Lorentzian resonance a curiosity which is rather useless for nanoplasmonics.

However, numerical simulations shown below reveal that the corresponding SP has relatively

small yet nonzero amplitude and is also characterized by very slow spatial decay. Therefore,

in suﬃciently long chains, this SP becomes dominant and can propagate, without signiﬁcant

further losses, to remarkable distance. We stress that the non-Lorentzian SP is an excitation

speciﬁc to discrete systems; it does not exist, for example, in metal nanowires.

But the above consideration applies only to ordered chains. Therefore, we consider next

the eﬀects of disorder. To isolate radiative losses due to scattering on imperfections from

Ohmic losses, we consider nanoparticles with inﬁnite conductivity (equivalently, zero Drude

relaxation constant). Although such metals do not exist in nature, an equivalent system

can be constructed experimentally by embedding metallic particles into a dielectric medium

with positive gain. We show that while the ordinary (deﬁned more precisely in the text

below) SP excitations are very sensitive to oﬀ-diagonal (position) disorder, the SP due to

the non-Lorentzian resonance is not. Diagonal disorder (disorder in nanoparticle properties)

is also considered.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we describe the theoretical model and

introduce basic equations. Conditions for resonance excitation of SPs in a chain are con-

sidered ins section III. Numerical results for propagation in ordered and disordered chains

are reported in sections IV and V, respectively. Finally, section VI contains a summary of

obtained results.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

Consider a linear chain of N nanospheres with radiuses an centered at points xn. We

work in the dipole approximation which is valid if xn+1 −

moments are coupled to each other and to external ﬁeld by the coupled-dipole equation [13]

Suppose that SP is excited at a given site (say, n = n0) by a near-ﬁeld probe. Then the

external ﬁeld can be set to En = E0δn,n0. Of course, this is an idealization: the ﬁeld produced

even by a very small near-ﬁeld tip is, strictly speaking, non-zero at all sites. However, this

approximation is physically reasonable because of the fast (cubic) spatial decay of the dipole

ﬁeld in the near-ﬁeld zone. The solution with En = δn,n0 is, essentially, the Green’s function

for polarization. We denote this Green’s function by

of the fact that SPs with q > k are non-radiating due to the light-cone constraint [8].

Non-radiating modes exist if π/h > k or, equivalently, if λ > 2h. Obviously, these SPs do

not couple to running waves but can be excited by a near-ﬁeld probe. The dimensionless

radiative relaxation parameter can be deﬁned as Q(k, q) = [ImS(k, q) + 2k3/3]/(2k3/3); this

factor is identically zero for q > k.

III. DISPERSION RELATIONS AND RESONANT EXCITATION OF SP

In this section, we consider periodic chains with an = a, ωpn = ωp, ωFn = ωF, γn = γ

and, consequently, with the constant polarizability αn = α.

It follows from formula (9) that the wave numbers q of SP excitations that can propagate

eﬀectively in an inﬁnite periodic chain are such that 1/α

S(k, q). This condition must

≈

be satisﬁed for some range of q which is, in some sense, small. Indeed, there is no eﬀective

interaction in the chain if 1/α
yields [21] dn ∝
become small. The dispersion relation in the usual sense, e.g., the dependence of the resonant

δn,0. We now examine the conditions under which the denominator of (9) can

const, in which case integration according to (9)

S(k, q)

−

≈

SP frequency on its wavenumber is obtained by solving the equation 1/α(ω)

S(ω/c, q) = 0.

This approach was adopted, for example, in Refs. 7, 8, 10, 17. Solution to the above

equation depends on the model for ǫ(ω) and may result in several branches of the complex

function ω(q). Here we adopt a slightly diﬀerent point of view. Namely, we note that for

real frequencies ω and wave numbers q, the real part of the denominator can change sign

while the imaginary part is always non-negative. Physically, Re[1/α(ω)

S(ω/c, q)] can

be interpreted as the generalized detuning from a resonance while Im[1/α(ω)

S(ω/c, q)]

−

−

−

gives total (radiative and absorptive) losses. We thus deﬁne the resonance condition to be

Re[1/α

S(k, q)] = 0 and view ω and q as independent purely real variables.

−

Plots of the dimensionless function h3S(k, q) are shown in Fig. 1 for some typical sets of

parameters and for two orthogonal polarizations of the SP. Note that the imaginary part

of h3S(k, q) is related to radiative relaxation parameter Q(k, q) [shown in Fig. 1(c,d)] by

h3ImS(k, q) = [2(kh)3/3][Q(k, q)

1]. Apart from the very narrow peaks appearing in

−

the case of perpendicular polarization and centered at q = k, [22] the numerical values of

do not exceed, approximately, 6. On the other hand, according to (7), we have

h3Re(1/α) = (h/a)3[1

(ω/ωF)2]. The dipole approximation is valid when (h/a)3 & 64.

−

Therefore, if we stay within the range of parameters in which the dipole approximation is

valid, the real part of the denominator in (9) is relatively small only if ω

ωF, i.e., if ω is

≈

near the Frohlich frequency of an isolated sphere. This is the case that will be considered

below.

Consider ﬁrst oscillations polarized orthogonally to the chain and let ω = ωF. The

condition of resonant excitation of SP is then ReS(k, q) = 0. It can be seen from Fig. 1(a)

6

that, for suﬃciently small values of the dimensionless parameter kh, there are two diﬀerent

values of q that satisfy the above resonance condition.

The ﬁrst solution is q = q1 ≈

0.47π/h (for kh = 0.2π). The value of q1 depends only

weakly on kh, as long as kh . 0.2π, and is approximately the same as in the quasistatic
limit kh = 0, in which case q1 ≈
the ordinary, or the quasistatic SP. This is because propagation of this SP is mediated by

0.46π/h. We will refer to the SP with this wave number as

near-ﬁeld interaction, while the far-ﬁeld interaction is suppressed by destructive interference

of waves radiated by diﬀerent nanoparticles in the chain. Since the wave number of the

ordinary SP is greater than k, it propagates without radiative losses. However, it may

experience spatial decay due to absorption in metal. The characteristic exponential length

of decay can be easily inferred from (9) by making the quasi-particle pole approximation.

Namely, we approximate S(k, q) as

is a positive parameter characterizing the absorption strength of the nanosphere. In general,

it can be shown that δ = 0 in non-absorbing particles whose dielectric function ǫ(ω) is

purely real at the given frequency ω. For the Drude model adopted in this paper, we have

δ = ωγ/a3ω2

F. Thus, the ordinary SP can decay exponentially due to absorption in metal

with the characteristic scale given by (12).

The second solution is obtained at q = q2 ≈

k, when ReS(k, q) has a narrow sharp peak

as a function of q (for ﬁxed k) [23]. This peak is explained by far-ﬁeld interaction in an

inﬁnite chain [13, 16]. It does not disappear in the limit kh

0, but becomes increasingly

(super-exponentially) narrow [16]. Note that in the above limit, this peak appears as a

singularity of zero integral weight which can not be obtained from the formal quasistatic

by the far-ﬁeld interaction. The latter is important in the case of extraordinary SP because

of the constructive interference of far ﬁeld contributions from all nanoparticles arriving at

a given one. Obviously, the extraordinary SP can be excited only in chains with h < λ/2,

where λ is the wavelength of light in free space.

It is interesting to consider radiative losses of the extraordinary SP. As can be seen from

Fig. 1(c), the factor Q(k, q) is discontinuous at q = k:

it is zero for q > k but positive

for q < k. Since the extraordinary SP has q

k, it can experience some radiative losses,

≈

although the exact law of its decay depends on parameters of the problem in a complicated

manner. This is, in part, related to inapplicability of the quasi-particle pole approximation

for evaluating the integral (9) in the vicinity of q

q2.

0.45π/h. This is the wave number of an ordinary (quasistatic)

(non-quasistatic) SP can be excited even for longitudinal oscillations. Mathematically, this

can be explained by observing that ∂ReS(k, q)/∂q diverges at q = k while ∂ImS(k, q)/∂q

is discontinuous at q = k and performing integration (9) by parts. However, the amplitude

of the extraordinary SP is much smaller for longitudinal oscillations than for transverse

oscillations; this will be illustrated numerically in the next section.

Finally, we note, that when inter-sphere separations become smaller than the radiuses,

higher-order multipole resonances can be excited [24–26]. In this case, resonant excitation

of SP can become possible even at frequencies which are far from the Frohlich resonance of

an isolated sphere, e.g., in the IR part of the spectrum.

IV. PROPAGATION IN FINITE ORDERED CHAINS

We now turn to propagation of SP in ordered chains of ﬁnite length N. We, however,

emphasize that the ﬁnite size eﬀects play a very minor role in the computations shown below.

Citrin [18] has studied dispersion relations in ﬁnite chains and has found that the inﬁnite-

chain limit is reached at N

10 (although we anticipate that longer chains are needed for

≈

accurate description of the extraordinary SP). In this and following sections, we work with

chains of N

1000. In this limit, propagation of both ordinary and extraordinary SP is not

much diﬀerent from the case of inﬁnite chains. In particular, we have veriﬁed numerically
Dk(xn, x501) (for kh = 0.2π) in a chain of N = 1001 particles
does not diﬀer in any signiﬁcant way from that in an inﬁnite chain, except for values of n

very close to either end of the ﬁnite chain. The Green’s function Gk(xn, x1) (here n0 = 1

is the end-point of the ﬁnite chain) diﬀered by a trivial factor in ﬁnite and inﬁnite chains

(results not shown). However, proper numerical evaluation of integral (9) required very

ﬁne discretization of q and was a more demanding and less stable procedure than direct

numerical solution of the system of equations (8).

In this section, we take an = a = const, αn = α = const and xn = nh, n = 1, . . . , N.

We also assume that kh = 0.2π and h = 4a. Practically, this can be realized for silver

particles in a transparent host matrix with refractive index of approximately n = 1.4 so that
the wavelength at the Frohlich frequency is λF = 2πc/ωF ≈
h = 40nm = 0.1λF and the sphere radius is a = 10nm = h/4. The dipole approximation is
Dk(xn, x1)

very accurate for this set of parameters. We then obtain the SP Green’s function

400nm, the chain spacing is

by solving Eq. (8) numerically.

The absolute value of the normalized SP Green’s function

Fk(xn) = Dk(xn, x1)

in a chain of N = 1000 nanospheres is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of x (sampled at x = xn)

for two orthogonal polarizations. Here the frequency of SP was taken to be exactly equal

to the Frohlich frequency ωF and the Drude relaxation constant was γ = 0.002ωF. It can

be seen from the ﬁgure that two diﬀerent SP are excited in the system. The ﬁrst is the

ordinary (quasistatic) SP that decays exponentially as exp(

x/ℓ), where ℓ is deﬁned by

−

(12). Corresponding asymptotes are shown by dotted lines. Note that the quasistatic SP

in a ﬁnite chain (with the point of excitation coinciding with one of the chain ends) is very

well described by the exponential decay formula, even though the latter was obtained for

inﬁnite chains. When the amplitude of the ordinary SP becomes suﬃciently small, there is

a crossover to the extraordinary SP. The decay rate of the extraordinary SP is much slower.

corresponds to the extraordinary SP in the slow-decaying segments.

Mathematically, the relatively slow decay of the extraordinary SP can be understood as

follows. First, note the the exponential decay of the ordinary SP is, in fact, the result of

superposition of an inﬁnite number of plane waves whose wave numbers are in the interval

∆q

δ. The corresponding wave packet decays spatially on scales ℓ

1/∆q. However, in

∝

∝

the case of extraordinary SP, ∆q can not be deﬁned since the corresponding resonance is

non-Lorentizian. It can be, however, stated that the extraordinary SP is a superposition of

plane waves whose wave numbers are very close to k. Since, however, the wavenumbers can

still slightly deviate from k, some spatial decay at large distances can still occur.

The conclusion we can make so far is that the ordinary SP experiences exponential decay

along the chain due to Ohmic losses in metal. This decay is very accurately described by

the quasi-particle pole approximation. The extraordinary SP has, initially, much smaller

amplitude than the ordinary one. This is because the peaks in Fig. 1 are very narrow. The

quasi-particle pole approximation is invalid for the extraordinary SP and its decay is much

less aﬀected by Ohmic losses. As a result, the extraordinary SP decays at a much slower rate

and, at suﬃciently large propagation distance, begins to dominate. We also note that the

the characteristic length scale ℓ given by (12). Note that, for the speciﬁc metal permeability

model (6), ℓ

ωF/γ. Some dependence of the rate of decay of the extraordinary SP on

∝

the ratio γ/ωF is visible in the case of orthogonal polarization [Fig. 3(a)]. However, when

the polarization is longitudinal [Fig. 3(b)], decay of the extraordinary SP is dominated by

radiative losses. In particular, the slow-decaying segments of the curves for γ/ωF = 0.002

and γ/ωF = 0.004 in Fig. 3(b) coincide with high precision.

Next, we study SP propagation for diﬀerent values of the ratio ω/ωF. As noted above,

we assume the parameters kh = ωh/c = 0.2π and h/a = 4 to be ﬁxed. Thus, ω/ωF can

vary either due to a change in ωF or due to a simultaneous change in ω, h and a such

that ωh = const and h/a = const. It follows from Fig. 1(a) that, for the selected set of

parameters, the ordinary plasmon can be excited for

0.89 < h3Re(1/α) < 1.56. This

corresponds to ω/ωF lying in the interval 0.988 < ω/ωF < 1.007. In Fig. 4, we illustrate

propagation of SP excitations for some values of ω/ωF inside this interval, exactly at the

lower and upper bounds of this interval, and slightly outside of the interval. Results are

shown for two values of absorption strength: γ/ωF = 0 and γ/ωF = 0.002.

First, consider the two cases when ω/ωF is outside of the interval where the ordinary
SP can be excited: ω/ωF = 0.984 and ω/ωF = 1.010 (correspondingly, h3Re(1/α) = 2.03

SP exhibits very fast spatial decay, which is characteristic for the noninteracting limit when

13

Gk(n, n0)

δn,n0. After the initial decay of the ordinary SP, the extraordinary SP becomes

∝

dominating. The extraordinary SP decays slowly by means of radiative losses. It is inter-

esting to note that decay of the extraordinary SP is almost unaﬀected by Ohmic losses in

metal, although a noticeable dependence on γ appears if we further increase the parameter

γ/ωF by the factor of 10 (data not shown). A qualitatively similar behavior is obtained

at ω/ωF = 1.010. However, the decay of extraordinary SP in this case is a little faster.

Paradoxically, the curve corresponding to γ/ωF = 0.002 is slightly higher than the curve

corresponding to γ = 0 in Fig. 4(f) (similar peculiarity is seen in Fig. 4(e)).

When the ratio ω/ωF is inside the interval where the ordinary SP can be excited

[Fig. 4(c,d)], SP propagation is strongly inﬂuenced by absorptive losses.

In the absence

of such losses, the ordinary SP propagates along the chain indeﬁnitely and dominates the

extraordinary SP. However, in the presence of even small absorption, the ordinary SP de-

cays exponentially so that, at suﬃciently large propagation distances, the extraordinary SP

starts to dominate. A qualitatively similar picture is also obtained for the borderline case

ω/ωF = 0.984 [Fig. 4(b)]. In the second borderline case [Fig. 4(e)], SP propagation is more

complicated. The wave numbers of both ordinary and extraordinary SPs in this case are

close to k, so that both can experience radiative decay, as is evident in the case of zero

absorption.

To conclude this section, we note that propagation of SP excitations in long periodic

chains can be characterized by exponential decay. This decay is caused either by absorptive

or by radiative losses. At small propagation distances, energy is transported by the ordinary

SP excitation, if the ordinary SP can be excited (e.g., if Re(1/α) is inside the appropriate

interval). However, at suﬃciently large propagation distances, there is a cross over to trans-

port by means of the extraordinary SP. In this case, propagation is mediated by far-zone

interaction and is characterized by slow, radiative decay which is aﬀected by absorptive

losses only weakly.

We note that exponential decay in ordered chains, if exists, is not caused by Anderson

localization, since we have not, so far, introduced disorder into the system. For example, as

was discussed in section III, a linear superposition of delocalized plane wave modes of the

form (9) can exhibit exponential decay with the characteristic length (12). The irreversible

exponential decay is, in fact, obtained because the delocalized modes form a truly continuous

spectrum (are indexed by a continuous variable q). Of course, any superposition of discrete

14

delocalized modes would result in Poincare recurrences.

V. PROPAGATION IN DISORDERED CHAINS

The ordinary (quasistatic) SP propagates in ordered chains without radiative losses due to

the perfect periodicity of the lattice. However, once this periodicity is broken, the quasistatic

SP can experience radiative losses and spatial decay even in the absence of absorption.

Dependence of the radiative quality of SP modes in ﬁnite one-dimensional chains on disorder

strength was studied in Ref. 8. It was shown that position disorder tends to decrease the

radiative quality factor of initially non-radiating (“bound”) modes. In this section we study

how the disorder inﬂuences propagation of the SP along the chain and take a separate look

at the ordinary and extraordinary SPs. We also consider two types of disorder: oﬀ-diagonal

and diagonal. Oﬀ-diagonal disorder is disorder in particle positions while all particles are

identical. Diagonal disorder arises due to diﬀerences in particle properties, even if the particle

positions are perfectly ordered.

The exponential decay due to Ohmic losses in the material can mask the eﬀects of disorder.

Therefore, we assume in this section that the nanospheres are non-absorbing, i.e., set γn = 0.

Physically, absence of absorption can be realized by embedding the chain of nanoparticles in

a transparent dielectric host medium with positive gain [27–30]. Such medium has dielectric

permeability ǫh with positive real and negative imaginary parts. The gain can be tuned so

that the eﬀective permeability of inclusions ǫ/ǫh is purely real and negative. We also work

in the regime kh = 0.2π, h = 4a.

A. Oﬀ-Diagonal Disorder

Oﬀ-diagonal disorder is disorder in particle position. It is called “oﬀ-diagonal” because it

aﬀects only oﬀ-diagonal elements of the interaction matrix Gk(xn, xn′). In the simulations

shown below, coordinates of particles in a disordered chain were taken to be xn = h(n + ξn)

where ξn is a random variable evenly distributed in the interval [

A, A]. The random num-

−

bers ξn are taken to be mathematically independent. Therefore, the disorder is uncorrelated.

The ﬁrst example concerns propagation in an non-absorbing chain of N = 10, 000

nanospheres excited exactly at the Frohlich frequency ω = ωF. Numerical results for dif-

15

ferent levels of disorder are illustrated in Fig. 5 where we plot

as a function of x

|Fk(x)

|

(sampled at x = xn).

One obvious conclusion that can be made from inspection of Fig. 5 is that disorder causes

spatial decay of SP. Since the system has no absorption, energy is lost to radiation. However,

the exact law of decay strongly depends on particular realization of disorder. In Figs. 6 and 7,

we plot the function

for A = 0.01 and A = 0.02, respectively, and for three diﬀerent

|Fk(x)

|

realizations of disorder (without the use of logarithmic scale). Giant ﬂuctuations in the

amplitude of transmitted SP are quite apparent. In all cases, after some initial growth, the

amplitude decays, although some random recurrences (due to re-excitation) can take place.

However, the amplitude

at a given site x = xn strongly depends on realization of

|Fk(x)

|

disorder and can be very far from its ensemble average, even at very large propagation
Fk(x) appears to be not self-averaging. In particular, any
2 does not satisfy either the radiative

particular realization of the intensity

distances. Therefore, the function

Ik(x) =

|Fk(x)

|

transport equation or the diﬀusion equation. The absence of transport and self-averaging is

characteristic for Anderson localization. We note that the localization discussed here is an

interference (radiative) eﬀect which is diﬀerent from localization of quasistatic polarization

modes studied in Refs. 31, 32. Localization properties of the eigenmodes in disordered chains

is a subject of separate investigation and will be reported elsewhere.

The situation is complicated by the presence of two types of SP excitations. One can

argue that localization properties of these two types of SPs might be diﬀerent. To investigate

this possibility, we perform two types of numerical experiments. First, we repeat simulations

illustrated in Fig. 5 but for ω/ωF = 0.948. In this case, the ordinary SP is not excited in

ordered chains (see Fig. 4(a)). Results are shown in Fig. 8 . It can be concluded from the

ﬁgure that oﬀ-diagonal disorder does not result in additional decay of the extraordinary SP.

In fact, the curves with A = 0, A = 0.1 and A = 0.04 are indistinguishable. This should

be contrasted with the case ω/ωF = 1, when, at the level of disorder A = 0.02, spatial

decay is already well manifested. The conclusion one can make is that the extraordinary

SP excitations do not experience localization due to uncorrelated oﬀ-diagonal disorder in

the chain. Therefore, spatial decay seen in Figs. 5 and 7 is decay of the ordinary SP. At
Fk(x) continues to oscillate around the baseline of the

very large propagation distances,

extraordinary SP.

and extraordinary SPs is simulation of an extinction measurement when the chain is excited,

instead of a nera-ﬁeld tip, by a plane wave E0 exp(iqx). Namely, we will look at the depen-

dence of the speciﬁc (per one nanosphere) extinction cross section σe on q. There are two

diﬀerent experimental setups that can be used to measure σe(q). When q is in the interval

q < k, this experiment can be carried out simply by varying the angle between the

0

≤

incident beam and the chain. However, values q > k are not accessible in this experiment.

In this case, the chain can be placed on a dielectric substrate and excited by evanescent

wave originating due to the total internal reﬂection of the incident beam. The maximum

longitudinal wave number of the evanescent wave is nk, where n > 1 is the refractive index

of the substrate. We note that it is not realistically possible to access all wave numbers up

to q = π/h in this way because, in the particular case kh = 0.2π, this would require the

refractive index n = 5. Refractive indices of such magnitude are not achievable in the optical

range. However, in a numerical simulation, we can assume that a hypothetical transparent

substrate with n = 5 exists. Besides, all wave numbers q in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the

lattice can be accessible for a diﬀerent choice of parameters (particularly, for larger values

of kh).

we plot the dimensionless quantity h−2σe(q) as a function of q for transverse oscillations in

partially disordered non-absorbing chains. Two peaks are clearly visible in the spectrum.
The ﬁrst peak at q = q1 ≈
peak at q = q2 ≈
and non-absorbing chains, the spectrum has a simple pole at q = q1. [33] In the ﬁnite chain

k corresponds to excitation of the extraordinary SP. In inﬁnite, periodic

0.47π/h corresponds to excitation of the ordinary SP. The second

with N = 10, 000, the singularity is replaced by a very sharp maximum. Introduction of even

slight disorder tends to further broaden and randomize this peak. Obviously, this broaden-

ing, as well as the randomization of the spectrum in the vicinity of q = q1, result in spatial

decay of the ordinary SP excitated by a near-ﬁeld tip. However, the peak corresponding

to the extraordinary SP is almost unaﬀected by disorder. Consequently, the extraordinary

SP does not experience localization and related spatial decay when oﬀ-diagonal disorder is

introduced into the system.

The physical reason why the extraordinary SP is not aﬀected by disorder is quite straight-

forward. This SP is mediated by electromagnetic waves in the far (radiation) zone that arrive

20

at a given nanosphere from all other nanospheres. The synchronism condition (that all these

secondary waves arrive in phase) is not aﬀected by disorder as long as the displacement am-

plitudes ξn are small compared to the wavelength. In the numerical examples of this section,

wavelength is ten times larger than the inter-particle spacing, which is, in turn, much larger

than the displacement amplitudes. Additionally, eﬀects of disorder are expected to be av-

eraged if the amplitudes ξn are mathematically independent because the scattered ﬁeld at

a given nanosphere is a sum of very large number of secondary waves.

In contrast, the

ordinary SP is mediated by near-ﬁeld interactions which are very sensitive to even slight

displacements of nanospheres. Besides, the scattered ﬁeld at a given nanosphere (when the

ordinary SP propagates in the chain) is a rapidly converging sum of secondary ﬁelds, so that

only a few terms in this sum are important and no eﬀective averaging takes place.

B. Diagonal Disorder

Diagonal disorder is disorder in the properties of nanospheres. There are several possi-

bilities for introducing such disorder.

First, the spheres can be polydisperse, i.e., have diﬀerent radiuses an. This is, however,

not a truly diagonal disorder. Indeed, polarizability of n-th nanosphere can be written in
a
this case as fnh
i
correction to 1/αn can be included into the dipole sum S(k, q), so that this analysis remains

is the average radius (note that the radiative

valid even when this correction is important). The factors fn are all positive-deﬁnite which

allows one to introduce a simple transformation of Eq. (1) which removes the diagonal

disorder [34]. Then the disorder becomes eﬀectively oﬀ-diagonal. More importantly, one

can retain a well-deﬁned spectral parameter of the theory, 1/

α

. We, therefore, do not

h

i

consider polydispersity in this section.

The second possibility is variation of the absorptive parameter γ. This eﬀect that can be

practically important. Yet, we are interested in propagation in the absence of Ohmic losses

and, therefore, set γn = 0.

The third, and the most fundamental, reason for diagonal disorder is variation of the

Frohlich frequency of nanospheres. Namely, we take the Frohlich frequency of the n-th

particle to be ωFn =

(1 + ξn), where ξn are statistically independent random variables

ωFi

h

evenly distributed in the interval [

A, A] and ω/

= 1. The factors fn in this case are

−

ωFi

h

21

no longer positive-deﬁnite and the transformation of Ref. 34 can not be applied. The most

profound consequence of introducing the diagonal disorder is that the spectral parameter

such as 1/α is no longer well deﬁned. As long as the disorder amplitude is relatively small,

one can view 1/

α

as an approximate spectral parameter. However, as the amplitude of

h

i

disorder increases, this approach becomes invalid. We have seen in section IV that variation

of the ratio ω/ωF in the interval 0.988 < ω/ωF < 1.007 can result in dramatic changes in the

way an SP excitation propagates along the chain. For ω/ωF outside of this interval, ordinary

SP could not be eﬀectively excited. However, in section IV, variation of ω/ωF applied to

all nanospheres simultaneously. We now introduce random uncorrelated variation of this

ratio for each individual nanosphere. The eﬀects of such disorder are diﬃcult to predict

theoretically. We can, however, expect that these eﬀects become dramatic for A & 0.01

since, in this case, the ratio ω/ωFn can be outside of the interval [0.988, 1.007].

We ﬁrst adduce in Fig. 10 the same dependencies as shown in Fig. 5 but for diﬀerent levels

of diagonal disorder. The results appear to be, qualitatively, quite similar, although in the

case A = 0.016, there is no visible trend for x/h > 3000. We then investigate whether the

extraordinary SP remains insensitive to diagonal disorder. Data analogous to those shown in

Fig. 8, but for diagonal disorder, are presented in Fig. 11. It can be seen that the inﬂuence of

diagonal disorder on the extraordinary SP is stronger than that of the oﬀ-diagonal disorder.

When the disorder amplitude A exceeds 0.01, the inﬂuence becomes quite dramatic. But

paradoxically, at A = 0.016, the average decay rate is much slower than for A = 0.008,

although the amplitude of ﬂuctuations is much larger.

To see why this happens, we look at the extinction spectra σe(q). These are plotted

in Fig. 12. The fundamental diﬀerence between the oﬀ-diagonal and diagonal disorder is

clearly revealed by comparing this ﬁgure to Fig. 9. Namely, the eﬀect of diagonal disorder

is not only to broaden and randomize the peak at q = q1, but also to shift it towards the

peak corresponding to the extraordinary SP. At suﬃciently large levels of disorder (A

≥
0.016), the separate peaks disappear and a broad structure emerges. At this point, ordinary

and extraordinary SP can no longer be distinguished. Correspondingly, the ordinary and

extraordinary SP are eﬀectively mixed in the A = 0.016 curve in Fig. 11, while fo smaller

amplitudes of the diagonal disorder, the extraordinary SP is excited predominatlly.

VI. SUMMARY

We have considered surface plasmon (SP) propagation in a linear chain of metal nanopar-

ticles. Computer simulations reveal the existence of two types of plasmons: ordinary (qua-

sistatic) and extraordinary (non-quasistatic) SPs.

The ordinary SP is characterized by short-range interaction of nanospheres in a chain.

The retardation eﬀects are inessential for its existence and properties. The ordinary SP

behaves as a quasistatic excitation. The ordinary SP can not radiate into the far zone in

perfectly periodic chains because its wave number is larger than the wavenumber k = ω/c of

free electromagnetic waves. However, it can experience decay due to absorptive dissipation

in the material.

The second, extraordinary, SP propagates due to long-range (radiation zone) interaction

in a chain.

Its excitation is possible due to the existence of the non-Lorentzian optical

resonance in the chain introduced in Ref. 16. The extraordinary SP may experience some

radiative loss but is much less afected by absorptive dissipation and disorder. As a result, it

can propagate to much larger distances along the chain. The extraordinary SP can be used

to guide energy or information in all-optical integrated photonic systems.

We have also considered the eﬀects of disorder and localization of the ordinary and

extraordinary SPs. Results of numerical simulations suggest that even small disorder in the

position or properties of nanoparticles results in localization of the ordinary SP. However, the

extraordinary SP appears to remain delocalized for all types and levels of disorder considered

in the paper.

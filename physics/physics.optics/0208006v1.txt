We introduce generalized Husimi functions at the interfaces of dielectric systems. Four different functions
can be deﬁned, corresponding to the incident and departing wave on both sides of the interface. These functions
allow to identify mechanisms of wave conﬁnement and escape directions in optical microresonators, and give
insight into the structure of resonance wave functions. Off resonance, where systematic interference can be
neglected, the Husimi functions are related by Snell’s law and Fresnel’s coefﬁcients.

Optical microresonators receive growing interest over the
last years, because of the intricate interplay of shape (leading
to irregular classical ray dynamics), openness of the system
(offering means of excitation and escape), and the wave na-
ture of the ﬁeld. This interplay, together with the promising
prospect of applications in future communication devices, has
stimulated experiments [1, 2, 3] as well as theoretical investi-
gations [4, 5] that were based on concepts well-known from
scattering theory, classical ray dynamics, semiclassics, and
quantum chaos [6]. A particularly useful tool to study waves
in dynamical systems is the Husimi representation of the wave
function in classical phase space. So far, the Husimi represen-
tation was mostly used to study the closed analogues of opti-
cal microsystems, with the dielectric interface being replaced
by hard walls, and the principal conﬁnement and radiation di-
rections have been inferred by adding the laws of reﬂection
and refraction by hand. Most notably, efforts in this direction
suffer from the fact that the incident and emerging wave com-
ponents cannot be discriminated by the conventional Husimi
representation. The reasons for these fundamental shortcom-
ings arise from the facts that the wave function of the dielec-
tric system is only partially conﬁned by the internal reﬂection
at the refractive index boundary, and that it is affected by the
different nature of the boundary conditions, which are neither
of Dirichlet nor of von-Neumann type but of a mixed type
that follows from Maxwell’s equations (both the wave func-
tion and its derivative are non-vanishing at the interface).

In this paper we introduce four Husimi functions appropri-
ate for dielectric interfaces, corresponding to the intensity of
incident and emerging waves at both sides of the interface.
In the regime of ray optics it will be demonstrated that these
Husimi functions are related across the interface via Fres-
nel’s formulas, with phase space being deformed according
to Snell’s law. This connection can be seen as a new vari-
ant of the inside-outside duality [7]. However, ray optics only
applies when the wave length is short and when systematic in-
terference effects can be neglected. The Husimi functions do
not require these limitations and develop their full predictive
power especially when systematic interference effects lead to
strong deviations from Fresnel’s and Snell’s laws. In partic-

ular, ray optics breaks down close to resonances, where the
internal part of the scattering wave function is known to be
almost independent of the incoming wave that excites the sys-
tem. The Husimi functions still provide an accurate represen-
tation of the wave function (in particular, they nicely display
the radiation directions of the ﬁeld). We illustrate these fea-
tures using the dielectric circular disk and an annular system
as examples [8].

Microresonators and ray optics. Consider the light that
illuminates and permeates a dielectric system conﬁned by a
refractive-index boundary, as shown in Fig. 1. The disk (and
also the annulus) are conﬁned by a circular dielectric inter-
face of radius rc
1. Polar coordinates r, Φ will be used to
parameterize position space. We distinguish four wave com-
ponents: The incident (inc) wave and the emerging (em) wave
on both sides of the interface (region 0 with refractive index
n0 = 1 outside the microresonator, region 1 with n1 ≡
n
inside the microresonator). In the regime of ray optics, the
wave is represented by rays, where the angles of incident and
emerging rays are related by the laws of reﬂection and Snell’s
law, n sin χ1 = sin χ0. For our circular interfaces Snell’s law
is equivalent to conservation of the angular-momentum vari-
able m = kj sin χj, where k0 and k1 = nk0 are the wave
number in each region. The ray intensities on either side fol-

Husimi functions at a dielectric interface. The Husimi
function at the system boundary of closed systems was in-
troduced in Refs. [9, 10] by projection of the conventional
Husimi function from full phase space [coordinates (r, Φ),
momentum (kj sin χj, kj cos χj)] onto the reduced phase
space at the boundary r = rc with coordinates φ = Φ and
sin χj [11]. The four different Husimi functions (correspond-
ing to the incident and emerging wave at both sides of a di-
electric interface) can be constructed by the same procedure
when the appropriate boundary conditions are employed. The
intensities I(φ, sin χ) = H(φ, sin χ) dφ d sin χ will turn out
to be related by the laws (1), (2) when ray optics applies, but
also accurately describe the wave function when ray-optical
relations across the interface break down, as expected, e.g.,
for resonances.

The conventional Husimi function for a given wave func-
tion Ψ(r, Φ) of the dielectric system is obtained as the overlap
with a wave packet with minimal uncertainty in the variables
(r, Φ) for real space and (kj sin χj, kj cos χj) for momentum
space. The projection onto the boundary can be formulated
rigorously [10]: The wave function is expressed by means
of advanced and retarded Green’s functions, which in turn
allow to distinguish between incident and emerging waves.
Green’s formula is then used to express the solution Ψj of the
Helmholtz equation in region j = 0, 1 as an integral over the
boundary, involving both Ψj and its normal (radial) derivative
Ψ′
j. A semiclassical (saddle-point) approximation then allows
to identify in these expressions the following four different
Husimi functions on the interface,

(a periodic function in Φ), which is restricted to the interface
and centered around (φ, sin χ). The parameter σ controls its
extension in φ-direction, thereby also ﬁxing the uncertainty in
sin χ. We set σ = √2/k1. The scaling with k1 results in the
same resolution in φ for all four Husimi functions.

Inside-outside duality. As a consequence of the bound-
ary conditions derived from Maxwell’s equations we ﬁnd the
identities h0(φ, sin χ0) = h1(φ, sin χ1), h′
0(φ, sin χ0) =
h′
1(φ, sin χ1), where the angles χi are related by Snell’s law.
From these relations it follows that our Husimi functions
strictly fulﬁll the condition of intensity conservation,

where the factor n = d sin χ0/d sin χ1 accounts for the phase-
space deformation by Snell’s law. Additional relations be-
tween the Husimi functions can be anticipated in the regime of
ray optics: The intensities on one side of the interface should
be related to the intensities on the other side by Eqs. (1), (2).
We then expect validity of the resulting inside-outside duality
relations

The duality relations are exactly fulﬁlled in two simple
cases, namely, if one incident or emerging wave vanishes or
when the two incident waves have the same intensity (the two
emerging waves then have the same intensity, as well). We
now test the duality relations in more general situations.

The panels on the left in Fig. 2 show the exact Husimi func-
tions from Eq. (4) for the case of the circular disk which is ex-
cited by a plane wave at an off-resonant excitation frequency.
The illuminating plane wave is clearly visible in the Husimi
function H inc
0 , around the polar angle φ = φill = π, while the
focal point of the dielectric disk results in a bright spot in H em
that is located around φ = 0. There is a close correspondence
between the Husimi functions of the incident and emerging
waves, and the deformation of phase space by the stretching
factor n of Snell’s law is clearly visible.

FIG. 2: Exact (left) and reconstructed (right) Husimi functions for
the circular dielectric disk (n = 2) illuminated by a plane wave at
an off-resonant frequency. The top panel shows the scattering wave
function in real space. The exact Husimi functions are obtained
from Eq. (4). The reconstructed Husimi functions are obtained by
Eqs. (9)–(12). Negative Husimi densities are shown in black. The
dashed lines in the panels for region 1 mark the critical angle of in-
cidence for total internal reﬂection.

The right panels of Fig. 2 show for comparison the pre-
dictions of Eqs. (9)–(12). In the reconstruction we used the
slightly modiﬁed semiclassical versions of Fresnel’s coefﬁ-
cients and Snell’s laws given in Ref. [13], which are appro-
priate for the present case of a curved interface (this results in
a slight, but still noticeable quantitative improvement of the
reconstruction). We observe a good qualitative and quantita-
tive agreement with the exact Husimi functions. Regions with
unphysical negative intensities are small. The most interest-
ing deviations between the exact and the reconstructed Husimi
functions occur around the central spot at φ = π, sin χj = 0,
where the incoherent predictions of Eqs. (9)–(12) underesti-
mate the exact Husimi densities H inc
0 , H em
0 , while they over-
1 , H em
estimate the intensities H inc
in the same area of phase
space. These deviations arise from a Fabry-Perot like system-
atic interference which is constructive in backward direction
at the presently chosen frequency. At other frequencies the in-
terference is destructive, and both cases alternate periodically.
Resonances. Figure 3 displays the situation for excitation at
a frequency which is close to a narrow resonance, a whisper-
ing gallery (WG) mode located around sin χ1 = 0.667. The
top panel shows that the wave function is now well conﬁned
inside the disk (region 1). Correspondingly, the Husimi func-
tions H inc
noticeably exceed the Husimi functions

are dominated by the characteristics of the resonance

wave function and consequentially are almost independent of
the choice of the exciting wave. (The remnants of the exciting
plane can be identiﬁed when comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 2.)
Hence the reconstructed Husimi functions deviate noticeably
1/n. This
from the exact Husimi functions around
is no surprise since resonances are formed by systematic con-
structive interference, and incoherent ray optics cannot be
expected to apply under these circumstances. Most impor-
tantly, by principle, the conﬁned wave intensity in the region
> 1/n cannot be reconstructed because classically no
sin χ1|
|
refracted rays ever reach this region (which is dark off reso-
nance). On the other hand, the exact Husimi functions display
nicely all the features of the resonance wave function in phase
space.

Finally, let us illustrate the usefulness of the Husimi func-
tions (4) also for a more complex system than the circular disk,
the annular system formed by regions of different refractive
indices that are conﬁned by two eccentric disks. The ray op-
tics in this system corresponds to nonintegrable dynamics in
phase space, which allows for a multifaceted set of resonance
wave functions [5]. Off resonance (Fig. 4) the scattering wave
function enters the dielectric system only barely, and the sit-
uation is similar to the circular disk because the internal disk
is not explored extensively. At resonance the situation is very
different. Figure 5 shows a typical resonance wave function in
real space and its Husimi representation in phase space. The
intensity of the resonance wave function is concentrated on
straight segments which can be identiﬁed as a short stable pe-
riodic trajectory of the corresponding classical ray dynamics.

inner disk, radii rc = 1, r
c = 0.6, displaced by δ = 0.22). The
system is illuminated by a plane wave at an off-resonant frequency
(illumination direction φill = π).

The Husimi functions display a strong intensity exactly in the
vicinity of this trajectory in classical phase space.

In conclusion, we introduced four Husimi representations
of the scattering wave function at the interfaces of dielectric
microresonators, corresponding to the incident and emerging
waves at both sides of the interface. These Husimi func-
tions are easily computed from the wave function and have
many desirable properties: They are related by the laws of
Fresnel and Snell in the ray-optics regime (i.e., short and off-
resonant wavelength) and generally provide valuable detailed
insight into the wave dynamics in complex dielectric systems,
most notably even close to resonances where ray optics breaks
down.

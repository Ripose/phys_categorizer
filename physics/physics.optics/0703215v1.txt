We show that QED nonlinear eﬀects imply a phase correction to the linear evolution of electro-
magnetic waves in vacuum. We provide explicit solutions of the modiﬁed Maxwell’s equations for
the propagation of a superposition of two plane waves, and calculate analytically and numerically
the corresponding phase shift. This provides a new framework for the search of all-optical signatures
of photon-photon scattering in vacuum. In particular, we propose an experiment for measuring the
phase shift in projected high-power laser facilities.

Introduction.- Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) pre-
dicts that at photon energies well below the elec-
tron rest energy, photon-photon collisions can still be
produced through the interchange of virtual electron-
positron pairs[1, 2]. This nonlinear interaction modi-
ﬁes Maxwell’s equations for the average values of the
electromagnetic quantum ﬁelds[3] and aﬀects the prop-
erties of the QED vacuum[4]. During many years, the
search of these eﬀects has been restricted to projected
particle physics experiments with accelerators. However,
photon-photon scattering processes in vacuum will be-
come testable at energy densities achievable with ultra-
high power lasers in the near future[5].

The realization of these ultra intense photon sources
began with the discovery of chirped pulse ampliﬁcation
(CPA)[6] in the late 80’s and optical parametric chirped
pulse ampliﬁcation (OPCPA) [7] in the 90’s. These tech-
niques opened the door to a ﬁeld of research in the bound-
ary between optics and experimental high-energy physics,
where lots of novelties are expected to come in the next
years. In fact, several recent works propose diﬀerent con-
ﬁgurations that can be used to test the nonlinear optical
response of the vacuum, e.g. using harmonic generation
in an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld[8], resonant interac-
tions in microwave cavities[9], or ultra-intense ﬁelds in
plasma channels[10], among others[11].

In the present Letter, we show that QED nonlinear ef-
fects in vacuum imply a phase correction to the linear
evolution of electromagnetic waves. We provide explicit
numerical and analytical solutions for the propagation
of a superposition of two plane waves. This result al-
lows us to calculate the corresponding phase shift, pro-
viding a new framework for the quest of signatures of
photon-photon scattering. In particular, we suggest dif-
ferent experimental scenarios for measuring the eﬀect of
nonlinear vacuum in projected high-power laser facilities
like the European Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI)
project[12] for near IR radiation or superconductor cav-
ities in the case of microwaves[9].

Thus, the structure of the work will be as follows: in
ﬁrst place we will present the modiﬁed equations for the

propagation of electromagnetic waves taking into account
QED corrections in the lagrangian density of the ﬁelds.
These modiﬁcations are introduced by a parameter ξ.
The inverse of this quantity has units of an energy den-
sity and thus it indicates the threshold for which non-
linear vacuum eﬀects become signiﬁcant. Then we will
study the perturbative regime, in which the non-linear
correction is very small. As we shall see, even in this
case measurable eﬀects can be accumulated when a radi-
ation travels over a long enough distance, depending on
the intensity of the ﬁelds. Finally we will comment an
experimental setup that can be implemented in order to
observe the eﬀects predicted.

Model and equations-. Let us begin by writing the for-
mulae that have to be used instead of the classical linear
Maxwell equations, including the terms which come from
QED eﬀects in vacuum. The corresponding Lagrangian
density in terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and
B, was derived in the 30’s by Euler and Heisenberg[2]:

While such intensities may have an astrophysical or cos-
mological importance, they are not achievable in the lab-
oratory. The best high-power lasers that are being pro-
jected for the next few decades will be several orders of
magnitude weaker, eventually reaching energy density of
1023J/m3[5]. Therefore, we will study here
the order ρ

rection is very small,

phase of beams of wavelength λ travelling over a distance

of studying the resulting equations for the ﬁelds E and
B, that can be found in the literature[3], for the present
purposes it is more convenient to consider the equations
for the gauge ﬁeld components Aµ. In general, these four
equations cannot be disentangled. However, after some
straightforward algebra it can be seen that they admit
solutions in the form of linearly polarized waves, e.g. in
the x direction, with A0 = 0 and A = (A, 0, 0), provided
that: i) the ﬁeld A does not depend on the variable x
(a transversality condition) and ii) A(t, y, z) satisﬁes the

we expect that the non-linear terms proportinal to ξ,

Let us consider two plane

k2 + q2. Any

tions of motion. In our perturbative regime, we can ex-
pect that the small non-linear correction will progres-
sively modify the form of A(t, y, z) as the wave proceeds
along the z direction. We will therefore make the ansatz

and β(0) = 0). On the other hand, we neglect the possi-
ble generation of a reﬂected wave depending on kz + ωt,
which can be expected to be a smaller correction in this
perturbative regime.

In principle, the coeﬃcient functions α and β may de-
pend on the transverse coordinate y as well. This should
be taken into account in order to study the possible
collapse eﬀects that might be induced by the nonlinear
terms during the propagation along the z axis. However,
in our perturbative regime such an eﬀect can be expected
to occur after a longer length scale, as compared to the
travel distances that will be considered below. For this
reason, we average out the possible y dependence.

According to the Variational Method, we require that
the functions α(z) and β(z) correspond to a local mini-
mum of the eﬀective action Γ, after averaging out y and
t as follows

This result also suggests the viability of an analitical
approximation, since each order in derivation of α and

β will give a suppression factor
of magnitude smaller than k and q. Since in our per-
turbative regime a can also be considered an expansion
parameter, we can approximate Eqs. (11), (12) as fol-

By substituting in Eq (9) and after some trigonometry,
we ﬁnd that our approximated analytical solution of the
non-lineal equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the
vacuum can be written as

Therefore, the eﬀect of the non-linearity is to change
the phase of the wave, with respect to the linear solution,
by a term that increases linearly with the distance. This
can also be interpreted as a change in the z component of
the wave vector, which becomes kz = k + χ, so that the

dispersion relation is modiﬁed to ω =
This result can also be restated in terms of an opti-
cal Kerr coeﬃcient of vacuum. In fact, if we assume an
eﬀective nonlinear refractive index of the form:

n = n0 + n2I,

(18)

where n0 = 1 is the linear refractive index of vacuum,
n2 the Kerr coeﬃcient due to nonlinear QED eﬀects and
I the irradiance of the beam, we can easily apply our

4

previous calculation of the phase shift in Eq.
(16) to
determine the Kerr coeﬃcient of vacumm. In media given
by Eq. (18), for propagation through a distance dz, the
wavefront phase will be modiﬁed by an amount:

Considering that ρ = I/c, comparing Eqs. (19) and (16),
we have that in the case q = k = ω/√2c, the Kerr coef-
ﬁcient of vacuum is given by:

n2 = ξ/√2c

which is in good agreement with previous calculations for
the DC Kerr eﬀect in vacuum[4].

Proposal of an experiment-. Our previous discussion
suggests that we might test the non-linear properties of
the QED vacuum by using sensitive experiments. The
developement of techniques which can measure nonlinear
7rad[13] together with
phase shifts as small as ∆Φ
ultra-high power lasers paves the way.
In fact, Let us
consider now a realistic experiment corresponding to the
parameters of the ELI project in its ﬁrst step; i.e.: pulses

of wavelength λ = 800nm, intensity I = 1029W m−

duration τ = 10f s which are focused in a spot of diame-
ter d

7rad,
Eq. (19), this results in a phase shift ∆Φ
which is measurable with current techniques like spec-
trally resolved two-beam coupling, which can be applied
for ultrashort pulses[13].

Conclusions.- We have calculated the phase shift aris-
ing form propagation of ultra-intense radiation in vac-
uum. Our result yields to an estimation of the optical
1. With
Kerr coeﬃcient of vacuum of n2
this value, we show that a detectable phase shift could
be measured in the ﬁrst step of ELI facility under con-
struction. We consider that the present work could serve
as a starting point for the quest of other nonlinear opti-
cal phenomena that may arise in ultra-high power laser
beams propagating in vacuum.

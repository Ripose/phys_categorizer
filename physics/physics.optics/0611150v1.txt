Abstract. – Zener tunneling in a binary array of coupled optical waveguides with transverse
index gradient is shown to produce a sequence of regular or irregular beam splitting and beam
recombination events superimposed to Bloch oscillations. These periodic or aperiodic Zener-
Bloch oscillations provide a clear and visualizable signature in an optical system of coherent
multiband dynamics encountered in solid-state or matter-wave systems.

Light propagation in waveguide arrays has provided in the past few years a conceptually
and experimentally relevant model to study the optical analogue [1–8] of Bloch oscillations
(BO) and related eﬀects typically encountered in solid-state or matter-wave systems [9, 10].
One of the major advantages oﬀered by waveguide arrays as compared to other optical sys-
tems [11] is the possibility to easily perform a direct visualization of the wave packet dynamics
in coordinate space [6] which is complementary to most usual frequency-domain (spectral)
measurements [9, 11]. Recent experiments in waveguide arrays [6, 8] have reported the beau-
tiful observation of optical Zener tunneling (ZT), thus motivating the study of multiband
dynamics in these systems. In presence of a constant ﬁeld, which yields a BO motion within a
single band approximation, ZT usually manifests as a cascading of transitions to higher-order
bands which results in the damping of the oscillatory BO motion or -in the spectral domain- in
the broadening of the Wannier-Stark (WS) resonances [9,12]. In Ref. [6] a direct visualization
of decaying BO via ZT to higher-order bands has been reported in a polymer waveguide array
with a low refractive index contrast, which is analogous to BO decay observed in Bose-Einstein
condensates in shallow lattices [10]. In the experiment of Ref. [6], the BO motion of a light
wave packet in the ﬁrst band of the array is periodically damped owing to the appearance
of ZT which manifests itself as regular outbursts of radiation escaping at the turning points
of the motion where the wave packet reaches the edge of the Brillouin zone in the recipro-
cal space. This decay of BO via periodic ZT bursts is irreversible and involves a cascading
of transitions to higher-order bands. However, as discussed in the context of semiconductor
superlattices [13, 14], a coherent dynamics instead of an irreversible decay process is expected
when only two bands, coupled by ZT, are involved. In this case the dynamics of occupation
probabilities in the two bands shows a complex coherent behavior which is related to the

In this Letter BO dynamics in a binary array of coupled optical waveguides is theoretically
analyzed and shown to provide an ideal optical system for a direct observation of two-band co-
herent Zener-Bloch dynamics, in which ZT manifests itself as an aperiodic or periodic splitting
and recombination of propagating light beam superimposed to the BO motion. The binary
array [15] consists of a sequence of alternating single-mode optical waveguides of diﬀerent
widths 2w1 and 2w2, separated by a/2, showing the same refractive index peak change ∆n
[Fig.1(a)]. We describe light propagation in the array by a rather standard two-dimensional
scalar Schr¨odinger-like equation [16,17], extended to include a transverse index gradient which
simulates either transverse thermal heating of waveguides [6] or waveguide curvature [4,5]. By
writing the electric ﬁeld as E(x, z, t) = ψ(x, z) exp(iknez − iωt) + c.c., where ω is the angular
frequency of the ﬁeld, k = ω/c0 its wave number in vacuum, and ne an eﬀective index of the
structure [17], the evolution of the ﬁeld envelope ψ along the propagation z direction satisﬁes
the paraxial wave equation

radius of curvature R by the simple relation F = ne/R [18]. Since the unit cell of the array
is a dimer and supports two modes (namely the symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations
of the modes guided by the narrow and wide waveguides), the band structure shows two

lowest-order bands [15], separated by a gap Eg which vanishes for w1 = w2. If the gap is
large enough, i.e.
if w1 is suﬃciently diﬀerent from w2 and the index change ∆n is not too
small, LZ is usually negligible at low or moderate values of F and BO occurs with a spatial
period zB = 2π¯h/(F a) = λ/(F a) (see, for instance, [4, 6, 21]). However, for w1 ≃ w2, the
two bands are separated by a small gap and ZT is no more negligible, although it may be
still disregarded for higher-order bands. A typical band diagram of the binary array [19]
for F = 0 and w1 ≃ w2 is depicted in Fig.1(b) for parameter values typical of Lithium-
Niobate waveguide arrays [20]. To study the role of ZT on BO dynamics, we numerically
simulated propagation of a broad Gaussian beam for diﬀerent values of the refractive index
gradient F , i.e. of the Bloch period zB. For the sake of simplicity, normal incidence has
been assumed, so that at the input plane of the array the ﬁrst band (n = 1) is mostly
excited [16]. For very small values of F , a characteristic BO motion with period zB is observed,
however as F is increased, i.e. as zB decreases, a sequence of beam splitting and beam
recombination at planes z = zB/2, 3zB/2, 5zB/2, ... is observed, which is related to ZT as
discussed below. The sequence is usually irregular, i.e. aperiodic, however at some special
values of F it shows a nearly-periodic pattern. Since this ZT sequence is superimposed to a
BO motion with period zB, the resulting beam motion can be referred to as optical Zener-
Bloch oscillations (ZBO). As an example, Figs.2(a) and 3(a) show typical numerical results
demonstrating either nearly-periodic or aperiodic ZBO. In both cases the array length is 8
cm. Note that, for a curved waveguide array the values of index gradient F used in the
simulations of Figs.2(a) and 3(a) correspond to a radius of curvature R ≃ 38.7 cm and
R ≃ 44.5 cm, respectively. To relate the observed dynamics with ZT, we adopt a rather
general technique developed in solid-state physics [12] and expand the wavepacket ψ(x, z) as
a superposition of Bloch states ϕn(x, κ) = un(x, κ) exp(iκx) of the array, i.e. we set ψ(x, z) =
π/a
−π/a dκcn(z, κ)ϕn(x, κ), where n is the band index, −π/a < κ < π/a, un(x + a, κ) =

−1 (zB = 15 mm), corresponding to aperiodic ZBO.

For the binary array with the band diagram shown in Fig.1(b) and for near normal beam
incidence, the main dynamics comprises only the two bands n = 1, 2. Figures 2(b) and
3(b) show the numerically-computed occupation probabilities for the two lowest-order bands
versus propagation distance, corresponding to the spatial ZBO motion of Figs.2(a) and 3(a).
Note that ZT is characterized by sharp and consistent interband transitions at planes z =
zB/2, 3zB/2, 5zB/2, ... connected by plateau regions where ZT is small. In these connecting
regions, the motion of the two wavepackets constructed by the superposition of Bloch modes
belonging to the two lowest-order bands are independent each other and shows BO. Beam
splitting and recombination is thus due to abrupt power transfer between the two wavepackets,
which in the plateau regions move into opposite directions according to the semiclassical
motion of a Bloch particle. To get deeper insights into the ZBO dynamics and to explain
the existence of special values of F leading to a periodic motion, we consider the evolution
equations for the spectral coeﬃcients cn(z, κ), which read [12]:

where Xn,l(κ) = Xl,n(κ)∗ = (2πi/a) R
n(∂ul/∂κ) and n, l = 1, 2 in the two-band ap-
proximation. The coupling term X1,2 in Eq.(2) accounts for interband transitions, i.e. ZT.
For a symmetric index proﬁle [n(x) = n(−x)], the Bloch functions un(x, κ) can be taken such
that X1,1 = X2,2 = 0 and X1,2(κ) = iΘ(κ), with Θ real valued and Θ(−κ) = Θ(κ). The
numerically-computed behavior of X1,2 for the binary array of Fig.1(a) is shown in Fig.1(c).
For broad beam excitation at normal incidence, the values of coeﬃcients c1,2 at the input
plane z = 0 are approximately given by c1(0, κ) ≃ g(κ) and c2(0, κ) ≃ 0, where the spectrum
g(κ) is narrow around κ = 0 . In this case, according to the acceleration theorem a solution
to Eqs.(2) is simply given by c1,2(z, κ) = f1,2(F z/¯h)g(κ − F z/¯h), where f1,2(κ) satisfy the
two-level equations with periodic coeﬃcients

by P1(z) = |f1|2 and P2(z) = |f2|2. ZT corresponds to non-adiabatic transitions at the points

of avoided crossing between the two bands, i.e at κ = π/a, 3π/a, 5π/a, ..., where the interband
coupling Θ is largest and the energy separation E2(κ) − E1(κ) smallest. This explains the
characteristic dynamics shown in Figs.2(b) and 3(b), which is rather well reproduced by a
numerical analysis of the two-level equations [see Figs.2(c) and 3(c)]. In order to explain the
existence of periodic ZBO at special values of index gradient F , let us note that, according
to Floquet theory the solution to Eqs.(3) and (4) is generally not periodic but characterized
by the two periods 2π/a and 2π/|µ2 − µ1|, where iµ1,2(F ) are the Floquet exponents of the
system. However, for special values of F such that |µ2(F ) − µ1(F )|/a is a fractional number
N/M (with N and M irreducible integers), the functions P1,2(z) are periodic with period
M zB. For instance, for |µ2 − µ1| = a/2 the evolution of occupation probabilities is periodic
with spatial period twice the Bloch period zB. Figure 4 shows the numerically-computed
behavior of |µ2 − µ1|/a versus zB = λ/(F a). Note that, at the intersections with the hori-
zontal dashed line, ZBO are periodic with period 2zB, which is the case shown in Fig.2. The
existence of periodic ZBO is closely related to the spectrum of Eq.(1), which for a two-band
model is given by two interleaved Wannier ladders whose separation depends on the refrac-
tive index gradient F [14]. We can express the Wannier ladders for Eq.(1) in terms of the
Floquet exponents iµ1,2 of the two-level equations (3) and (4) by extending the procedure
of Ref. [12]. We look for solutions of Eqs.(2) in the form cn(z, κ) = ¯cn(κ) exp(−iEz/¯h) and
impose the periodic boundary conditions ¯cn(0) = ¯cn(2π/a) to ﬁnd the spectrum E. After
some straightforward calculations, this yields for the spectrum the two interleaved Wannier
ladders En = −µ1(F )F + nF a and Em = −µ2(F )F + mF a, where m and n are arbitrary
integers and iµ1,2 are the Floquet exponents of the periodic system Eqs.(3) and (4). The
condition for periodic ZBO is obtained when the spacing F |µ2 − µ1| between the two ladders
is a fractional multiple of the single ladder spacing F a.
In conclusion, an optical realization of coherent BO motion superimposed to a periodic or
aperiodic ZT sequence, leading to ZBO, has been proposed. This coherent dynamics should
be directly visualized in a binary array with transverse refractive index gradient as a sequence
of beam splitting and recombination.

[18] For a curved waveguide with a local curvature ¨x0, in the paraxial approximation and after
a Kramers-Henneberger transformation the curvature corresponds to a local index gradient
F = −ne ¨x0 (see, for instance, Eq.(2) of [5]). For circulary-curved waveguides, in the paraxial
approximation one has ¨x0 = ±1/R, where R is the waveguide radius of curvature, and hence
F = ∓ne/R. See also Ref. [4].
In Fig.1(b), En(κ) is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator H = −(¯h2/2ne)(∂2/∂x2)+V (x)
with a potential V (x) = ne −n(x), where κ in the Bloch wave number, chosen in the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone, and n is the band index. Therefore, in the quantum context Fig.1(b) represents the energy
band diagram of H, and the energy En(κ) thus increases with band index n. To understand
the meaning of En(κ) in the optical context, note that the eﬀective propagation constant of the
eigenmode (or supermode) of the array for the n-th band is given by βn(κ) = k[ne − En(κ)],
i.e. ne − En(κ) is the eﬀective index of the supermode. A diﬀerent way to denote the bands of
the array, which was adopted in Ref. [16], is to plot the propagation constant βn(κ) instead of
En(κ) = ne − βn(κ)/k. In this case βn(κ) decreases as the band index n is increased.

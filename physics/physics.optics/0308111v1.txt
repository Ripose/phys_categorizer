Abstract

Multipole expansion of an incident radiation ﬁeld—that is, representation of the ﬁelds as sums
of vector spherical wavefunctions—is essential for theoretical light scattering methods such as the
T-matrix method and generalised Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT). In general, it is theoretically straight-
forward to ﬁnd a vector spherical wavefunction representation of an arbitrary radiation ﬁeld. For
example, a simple formula results in the useful case of an incident plane wave. Laser beams present
some difﬁculties. These problems are not a result of any deﬁciency in the basic process of spherical
wavefunction expansion, but are due to the fact that laser beams, in their standard representations, are
not radiation ﬁelds, but only approximations of radiation ﬁelds. This results from the standard laser
beam representations being solutions to the paraxial scalar wave equation. We present an efﬁcient
method for determining the multipole representation of an arbitrary focussed beam.

Introduction

Multipole expansion of an incident radiation ﬁeld in terms of vector spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs) is
required for theoretical scattering methods such as the T-matrix method [1, 2, 3] and generalised Lorenz-
Mie theory (GLMT) [4]. Since the VSWFs are a complete orthogonal basis for solutions of the vector
Helmholtz equation,

2E + k2E = 0,

∇

(1)

it is theoretically straightforward to ﬁnd the multipole expansion for any monochromatic radiation ﬁeld
using the orthogonal eigenfunction transform [5, 6], also known as the generalised Fourier transform.
For example, the usual formula for multipole expansion of a plane wave can be derived in this way.

While the case of plane wave illumination is useful for a wide range of scattering problems, many
applications of scattering involve laser beams. In particular, laser trapping [7] requires strongly focussed
beams. As scattering calculations allow the optical forces and torques within the optical trap to be de-
termined [8, 9], and the T-matrix method is particularly useful for the repeated calculations typically
required, multipole expansion of laser beams, including strongly focussed beams, is extremely useful.

Unfortunately, laser beams present some serious theoretical difﬁculties. These problems are not a
result of any deﬁciency in the basic process of multipole expansion of radiation ﬁelds, but are due to
the fact that standard representations of laser beams are not radiation ﬁelds—that is, their standard

1

mathematical forms are not solutions of the vector Helmholtz equation, but are solutions of the paraxial
scalar wave equation (higher order corrections can be used to improve the accuracy as reality becomes
less paraxial [10]). Such pseudo-ﬁelds are only approximate solutions of the vector wave equation. The
deviation from correctness increases as the beam is more strongly focussed [11, 12, 13].

While, in principle, any radiation ﬁeld can be expanded in terms of multipoles, multipole expansions
do not exist for approximate pseudo-ﬁelds that do not satisfy the vector wave equation. Since the stan-
dard paraxial representations of laser beams are so widely used, multipole expansions that correspond
to the standard beams in a meaningful way are highly desirable. For this to be possible, some method
must be used to “approximate” the standard laser beam with a real radiation ﬁeld. We can note that there
exists a signiﬁcant and useful body of work on multipole expansion of beams [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
However, while satisfactorily efﬁcient and accurate methods exist for weakly focussed beams, when
the deviations from paraxiality are small, strongly focussed beams, for example, as required for laser
trapping, remain problematic.

The traditional method used in scattering calculations was to assume that the actual incident ﬁeld
was equal to the paraxial ﬁeld on the surface of the scatterer. This has the unfortunate drawback that the
multipole expansion coefﬁcients depend on the size, shape, location, and orientation of the scattering
particle. As a result, an artiﬁcial dependence on particle position and size is introduced into scattering
calculations and calculations of optical forces, since the differing multipole expansions correspond to
different beams. This is obviously undesirable. While matching the ﬁelds on the surface of the scat-
tering particle is not an adequate solution to the problem, the basic concept—matching the ﬁelds on a
surface—is sound. However, a scatterer-independent surface must be used. Two natural choices present
themselves: the focal plane (for beams with a well-deﬁned focal plane), and a spherical surface in the far
ﬁeld.

Integral methods can be used over these surfaces (direct application of the orthogonal eigenfunction
transform). Here, however, we use a point-matching method since, ﬁrstly, the method tolerates a much
coarser grid of points, thereby increasing computational efﬁciency, and secondly, increased robustness
can be gained by using extra points to give an overdetermined system of equations which can then be
solved in a least-squares sense. We use both focal plane matching and far ﬁeld matching, and evaluate
their respective merits.

2 Point-matching method

All monochromatic radiation ﬁelds satisfy the vector Helmholtz equation (1) in source-free regions. The
vector spherical wavefunctions (sometimes called vector spherical harmonics) are a complete set of or-
thogonal solutions to this equation. The VSWFs are

singularity-free regular vector spherical wavefunctions:

Since the VSWFs are a complete set of solutions to the vector Helmholtz equation (1), every solution
can be written as a linear combination of VSWFs. Thus, the incident ﬁeld can be written in terms of

The two sets of expansion coefﬁcients are related, since a(3)
ﬁeld expansion coefﬁcients will differ). In practice, the multipole expansion will be terminated at some
n = Nmax. For the case of multipole ﬁelds produced by an antenna that is contained within a radius a,
Nmax = ka is usually adequate, but Nmax = ka + 3 3√ka is advisable if higher accuracy is needed [21].
This can also be used as a guide for choosing Nmax for beams—if the beam waist is contained in a radius
a, this can be used to choose Nmax. Since the multipole ﬁeld necessarily deviates from the paraxial ﬁeld,
the required accuracy is open to question. It appears that a = w0 generally gives adequate results.

For focal plane matching of the ﬁelds, the regular wavefunctions are used, while for far ﬁeld match-
ing, the incoming wavefunctions are used. The use of only the incoming portion of the ﬁeld for matching
the ﬁelds in the far ﬁeld means that no knowledge of the outgoing portion of the ﬁelds is required.

If the ﬁeld expansion is truncated at n = Nmax, equation (9) or (10) contain 2(N2

max + 2Nmax) un-
known variables—the expansion coefﬁcients anm and bnm. They can be found from a set of 2(N2

2Nmax) equations. If we know the ﬁeld at enough points in space, either by using the standard paraxial
form of the beam, or from measurements, a sufﬁciently large set of equations can be generated. Since the
electric ﬁeld has three vector components at each point in space, three equations result from each point.
For robustness, extra points can be used to give an over-determined linear system which can then be

O(N6
max) for surface
methods and O(N5
max) for volume methods, integral methods require a much more closely spaced grid of
points. Since we are mainly interested in strongly focussed beams, when Nmax is small, the gain in speed
through the use of a coarse grid results in improved performance. We can note that the most efﬁcient
solution to very wide beams is simply to approximate them as plane waves (an O(Nmax) solution), which
will be quite adequate if the scattering particle is small compared to the beam width, and located near
the beam axis. Optimisations for axisymmetric beams, giving O(N3
max) performance, are described later.

3 Focal plane matching

Point-matching in the focal plane offers a number of advantages. Firstly, the paraxial beam has a simple
phase structure in the focal plane. Secondly, the focal plane is likely to be the region in which scattering
or trapping takes place. Thirdly, the irradiance distribution in the focal plane may be known experi-
mentally. Although an accurate measurement of the focal plane irradiance distribution is usually quite
difﬁcult, due to the ﬁnite resolution of typical detectors, the structure of the beam, and the approximate
focal spot size, can be determined. The major disadvantage is that the greatest differences between the
paraxial beam and the real beam can be expected to occur in the focal plane. For example, a paraxial
beam has zero longitudinal components of the electric ﬁeld, but, from Maxwell’s equations, the longitu-
dinal component must be non-zero.

For mathematical convenience, we choose a coordinate system so that the beam axis coincides with
the z axis, with the beam propagating in the +z direction, with the focal plane coincident with the
xy plane (the θ = π/2 plane). Next, we can generate a grid of points, and calculate the electric ﬁeld
components of the paraxial beam at these points.

A practical difﬁculty immediately presents itself, however, since the spherical harmonics Ym
n (θ, φ)
with odd n + m are odd with respect to θ, and will be zero for θ = π/2—the focal plane. This is to
be expected physically, since the same electric ﬁeld amplitude in the focal plane can correspond to a
beam propagating in the +z direction, the
z direction, or a standing wave created by the combination
of these. A mathematically rigorous way of dealing with this is to match the derivatives of the electric
ﬁeld amplitude, as well as the ﬁeld amplitude itself. However, this isn’t necessary, since we have al-
ready chosen a direction of propagation as one of the initial assumptions. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient, and
computationally efﬁcient, to use only those VSWFs that will be non-zero to determine the corresponding
“missing” expansion coefﬁcients. This will give half of the required expansion coefﬁcients. Then, from
the direction of propagation, anm =
anm gives the “missing” coefﬁcients. If the beam
z direction, anm = bnm or bnm = anm are used. If the beam was a pure standing wave
propagates in the
combination of counter-propagating beams, these expansion coefﬁcients would be zero.

In principle, this procedure can be carried out for an arbitrary beam. However, determining the
vector components of beams where the Poynting vector is not parallel to the z axis in the focal plane will
be problematic, since there will be no unique choice of electric ﬁeld direction since the paraxial beam is
also a scalar beam. Therefore, we will restrict ourselves to beams with z-directed focal plane Poynting
vectors only. This eliminates, for example, Laguerre-Gaussian beams LGpl with l

= 0.

Often, the beam of interest will have an axisymmetric irradiance distribution. Any beam that can be
written as a sum of l = 0 Laguerre-Gaussian modes LGp0 will satisfy this criterion. The most signiﬁcant
such beam is the TEM00 Gaussian beam (which is also the LG00 beam). Beams with these properties
1 multipole components [15, 16], which follows simply from the exp(imφ) dependence
have only m =
of the VSWFs. This allows a signiﬁcant computational optimisation, since only the m =
1 VSWFs need
to be included in the point-matching procedure. This results in O(N3
max) performance.

The point-matching procedure described above was implemented using MATLAB [22]. Since the
main computational step is the solution of an overdetermined linear system, a linear algebra oriented
language/system such as MATLAB was natural choice. Additionally, existing MATLAB routines for
the calculation of Bessel, Hankel, and associated Legendre functions allow simple calculation of VSWFs.
Since the VSWFs only need to be calculated for θ = π/2, a special purpose fast VSWF calculation routine
could be used.

The general structure of a real beam point-matched with a TEM00 Gaussian beam of waist radius
w0 = 0.5λ is shown in ﬁgure 1. The beam is very similar to those given by Gouesbet’s localised approx-
imation [15, 16, 19], although the (very small) y component is somewhat different. The robustness of the
algorithm is shown by the generation of the correct z components for the ﬁnal beam, even though the
original paraxial beam was unphysically assumed to have Ez = 0.

The behaviour of the beam as it is more tightly focussed is shown in ﬁgure 2. The increasing axial
asymmetry of plane-polarised beams as they are more strongly focussed can be clearly seen. The other
feature to note is that focussed beams have a minimum waist size—the more strongly focussed beams
shown here closely approach this minimum size, the well-known diffraction limited focal spot [23,24,25].
The lack of any such limit in the paraxial beam is blatantly unphysical, and we cannot expect a beam
matched to a w0 = 0.1λ paraxial beam to have such an unreasonably small waist radius.

The Nmax for these calculations was determined by assuming that an effective radius of 3w0 contains
the entire beam in the focal plane. This gives Nmax = 16, 9, and 6 for the three beam widths of w0 = 0.5λ,

plane-polarised beam as it is more strongly focussed, and the approach of the beam to a minimum focal
spot radius. All distances are in units of the wavelength.

w0 = 0.2λ, and w0 = 0.1λ. All VSWFs were included in the solution (that is, the axisymmetric beam
optimisation was not used), so the number of unknown variables for each case was 576, 198, and 96.
The ﬁelds were matched at a number of points equal to the number of variables, distributed on a polar
grid. This is an overdetermined system, with 50% more points than required. The times required for the
solution of the linear system on a 1.5 GHz PC were 11.2 s, 0.50 s, and 0.046 s, respectively. If the solution
is restricted to the m =
1 VSWFs, the number of variables is reduced to 4Nmax, and the times required
for the three cases shown are reduced to 0.006 s, 0.002 s, and 0.001 s.

3.2 Bi-Gaussian beam

We consider a simple non-axisymmetric beam, constructed by replacing r2 in the paraxial Gaussian beam
formula (11) by (ax)2 + (by)2, giving a bi-Gaussian irradiance distribution with an elliptical focal spot.
The expansion coefﬁcients are no longer restricted to m =

1.

The irradiance distributions of point-matched bi-Gaussian beams are shown in ﬁgure 3. The effect
of the minimum spot size is evident, as it ﬁrst restricts the focussing in the y direction, and then the x
direction, as the beam is more strongly focussed. The odd m multipole components are non-zero in these
beams. The increased width of the beam results in longer calculations using the 3w0 cutoff radius. A
smaller cutoff radius equal to w0 produces very similar results, and may be more suitable for practical

use. Since the non-zero expansion coefﬁcients can be predicted from the symmetry of the beam, it would
also be possible to speed up the calculations by only including those coefﬁcients.

Figure 3: Irradiance contours in the focal plane of multipole beams focal-plane matched with circularly-
polarised bi-Gaussian beams. The beam ellipticity factors are a = 0.5 and b = 1 for all cases. The beam
waists vary from left to right as w0 = 0.5λ, w0 = 0.2λ, and w0 = 0.1λ. The effective beam waist in the x
direction is 2w0. All distances are in units of the wavelength.

4 Far ﬁeld matching

In the far ﬁeld, the beam becomes an inhomogeneous spherical wave. The radial component of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds vanishes. The large radius limits for the VSWFs [3]:

can be usefully employed. The far ﬁeld is best written in spherical polar coordinates, since this gives at
most two non-zero components. In cartesian coordinates, all three components will generally be non-
zero, although only two will be independent. Since only two vector components of the ﬁeld can be used
in the point matching procedure, the minimum number of points at which to match the ﬁelds that is
needed is higher.

w0 = 0.2λ, and w0 = 0.1λ. All distances are in units of the wavelength.

4.2 LGpl beams

We recall that the focal plane matching procedure is greatly complicated when the Poynting vector in the
focal plane is not parallel to the beam axis, and note that the same does not apply to far ﬁeld matching—
the Poynting vector is always purely radial in the far ﬁeld regardless of its behaviour in the focal plane.
Therefore, beams of these types, such as Laguerre-Gaussian LGpl doughnut beams are best dealt with by
far ﬁeld matching. (The failure of naive attempts to model LGpl beams by focal plane matching simply
by using the correct irradiance distribution with the correct exp(imφ) azimuthal phase variation for Ex
is readily observed when attempted.) The far ﬁeld limit for Laguerre-Gaussian beams [23] is

4.3 Truncation by an aperture

Truncation by an aperture is readily included by restricting non-zero values of the incoming beam to
less than the angle of the aperture. If a hard-edged aperture is assumed, a much higher Nmax is required
to accurately truncate the ﬁeld. The aperture must sufﬁciently far away for the far ﬁeld limit to be
n2/k. A soft-edged aperture may also more realistically model
accurate, which requires a distance r
the actual physical system. The effect of increasing truncation of a beam is shown in ﬁgure 6. The

beam is a circularly polarised TEM00 beam of waist radius w0 = 0.2λ. Axisymmetry was assumed,
with Nmax = 48, with the solution of the linear system requiring 0.79 s on a 1.5 GHz PC. The radiation
patterns show that the hard-edged aperture is modelled with reasonable, but not perfect accuracy. The
errors due to using a ﬁnite number of VSWFs to model the sharp edge are exactly analogous to those
seen when using a ﬁnite number of Fourier terms to model a sharp step. The increase in focal spot size
due to diffraction is clearly shown.

5 Conclusion

The point-matching method can be successfully used to obtain multipole expansion equivalents of fo-
cussed scalar paraxial beams. Multipole expansions are required for scattering calculations using the
T-matrix method or GLMT, or calculations of optical forces and torques using these method, and to be
able to obtain a satisfactory expansion of a strongly focussed laser beam that is equivalent in a mean-
ingful way to a standard paraxial laser beam is highly desirable. The method is fastest when the beams
are strongly focussed, since the maximum degree Nmax required for convergence is smaller. The method
appears usable even when the beam is focussed to the maximum possible extent. Truncation of the beam
by apertures is readily taken into account. If it is necessary to truncate the multipole expansion at Nmax
less than the value ideally required for exact representation of the beam (for example, if the T-matrix

of the scatterer is truncated at this Nmax), the multipole expansion given by the point-matching method
will be the best ﬁt, in a least squares sense, obtainable for this Nmax. If Nmax is sufﬁciently large, the
multipole expansion will be well-convergent, and the multipole ﬁeld can be made to be arbitrarily close
to the far ﬁeld/focal plane ﬁeld with which it is matched. While the multipole beam will not be equal
to the original paraxial beam over all space (only on the matching surface), the multipole beam can be
considered as a non-paraxial version of the standard beam.

While the emphasis in this paper has been on obtaining multipole expansions of standard beams, the
method used is applicable to arbitrary beams, including analytical forms of beams with corrections for
non-paraxiality. Since multipole expansions of such beams are still required for the types of scattering
calculations considered here, the point-matching method may prove useful applied to such beams. The
only restriction on the beam in question is that it must be possible to calculate the ﬁelds at a suitable
representative set of points.

Compared with integral methods, point-matching is faster for strongly focussed beams since the
method tolerates a wider grid point spacing. The chief disadvantage, compared with integral methods,
is worse performance for sufﬁciently large Nmax.

Compared with the localised approximation [15, 16, 19], point-matching is slower, but is applicable
to extremely focussed beams, and allows simple calculation for arbitrary beams, including beams with
no known analytical representation.

Practical applications typically require multipole expansions of the beam in a coordinate system cen-

10

tred on a scattering particle, rather than the beam waist as done in the examples presented here. There
are two distinct methods in which particle-centred expansions can be determined. Firstly, it should be
noted that there is no requirement in the point-matching method for the beam waist to coincide with
the xy plane and the beam axis to coincide with the z axis. Therefore, coordinate axes can be chosen to
coincide with the scattering particle, and the points in the focal plane or far ﬁeld at which the ﬁelds are
matched speciﬁed in this particle-centred coordinate system. This is simply done for focal plane match-
ing. For far ﬁeld matching, we note that translation of the coordinate system by x is equivalent to a phase
shift of kx
ˆr at the points in the far ﬁeld. A larger Nmax will typically be required for convergence since
a larger radius is required to contain the beam waist when the beam waist is not centred on the origin.

In conclusion, a reasonable solution to the problem of multipole representation of strongly focussed
laser beams is presented. Although the VSWF expansions are not identical to the paraxial beams from
which they are derived, they are related in a natural manner. These beams are of particular interest for
optical trapping and scattering by single particles within optical traps.

Abstract

Multipole expansion of an incident radiation ﬁeld—that is, representation of the ﬁelds as sums
of vector spherical wavefunctions—is essential for theoretical light scattering methods such as the
T-matrix method and generalised Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT). In general, it is theoretically straight-
forward to ﬁnd a vector spherical wavefunction representation of an arbitrary radiation ﬁeld. For
example, a simple formula results in the useful case of an incident plane wave. Laser beams present
some difﬁculties. These problems are not a result of any deﬁciency in the basic process of spherical
wavefunction expansion, but are due to the fact that laser beams, in their standard representations, are
not radiation ﬁelds, but only approximations of radiation ﬁelds. This results from the standard laser
beam representations being solutions to the paraxial scalar wave equation. We present an efﬁcient
method for determining the multipole representation of an arbitrary focussed beam.

Introduction

Multipole expansion of an incident radiation ﬁeld in terms of vector spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs) is
required for theoretical scattering methods such as the T-matrix method [1, 2, 3] and generalised Lorenz-
Mie theory (GLMT) [4]. Since the VSWFs are a complete orthogonal basis for solutions of the vector
Helmholtz equation,

2E + k2E = 0,

∇

(1)

it is theoretically straightforward to ﬁnd the multipole expansion for any monochromatic radiation ﬁeld
using the orthogonal eigenfunction transform [5, 6], also known as the generalised Fourier transform.
For example, the usual formula for multipole expansion of a plane wave can be derived in this way.

While the case of plane wave illumination is useful for a wide range of scattering problems, many
applications of scattering involve laser beams. In particular, laser trapping [7] requires strongly focussed
beams. As scattering calculations allow the optical forces and torques within the optical trap to be de-
termined [8, 9], and the T-matrix method is particularly useful for the repeated calculations typically
required, multipole expansion of laser beams, including strongly focussed beams, is extremely useful.

Unfortunately, laser beams present some serious theoretical difﬁculties. These problems are not a
result of any deﬁciency in the basic process of multipole expansion of radiation ﬁelds, but are due to
the fact that standard representations of laser beams are not radiation ﬁelds—that is, their standard

1

mathematical forms are not solutions of the vector Helmholtz equation, but are solutions of the paraxial
scalar wave equation (higher order corrections can be used to improve the accuracy as reality becomes
less paraxial [10]). Such pseudo-ﬁelds are only approximate solutions of the vector wave equation. The
deviation from correctness increases as the beam is more strongly focussed [11, 12, 13].

While, in principle, any radiation ﬁeld can be expanded in terms of multipoles, multipole expansions
do not exist for approximate pseudo-ﬁelds that do not satisfy the vector wave equation. Since the stan-
dard paraxial representations of laser beams are so widely used, multipole expansions that correspond
to the standard beams in a meaningful way are highly desirable. For this to be possible, some method
must be used to “approximate” the standard laser beam with a real radiation ﬁeld. We can note that there
exists a signiﬁcant and useful body of work on multipole expansion of beams [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
However, while satisfactorily efﬁcient and accurate methods exist for weakly focussed beams, when
the deviations from paraxiality are small, strongly focussed beams, for example, as required for laser
trapping, remain problematic.

The traditional method used in scattering calculations was to assume that the actual incident ﬁeld
was equal to the paraxial ﬁeld on the surface of the scatterer. This has the unfortunate drawback that the
multipole expansion coefﬁcients depend on the size, shape, location, and orientation of the scattering
particle. As a result, an artiﬁcial dependence on particle position and size is introduced into scattering
calculations and calculations of optical forces, since the differing multipole expansions correspond to
different beams. This is obviously undesirable. While matching the ﬁelds on the surface of the scat-
tering particle is not an adequate solution to the problem, the basic concept—matching the ﬁelds on a
surface—is sound. However, a scatterer-independent surface must be used. Two natural choices present
themselves: the focal plane (for beams with a well-deﬁned focal plane), and a spherical surface in the far
ﬁeld.

Integral methods can be used over these surfaces (direct application of the orthogonal eigenfunction
transform). Here, however, we use a point-matching method since, ﬁrstly, the method tolerates a much
coarser grid of points, thereby increasing computational efﬁciency, and secondly, increased robustness
can be gained by using extra points to give an overdetermined system of equations which can then be
solved in a least-squares sense. We use both focal plane matching and far ﬁeld matching, and evaluate
their respective merits.

2 Point-matching method

All monochromatic radiation ﬁelds satisfy the vector Helmholtz equation (1) in source-free regions. The
vector spherical wavefunctions (sometimes called vector spherical harmonics) are a complete set of or-
thogonal solutions to this equation. The VSWFs are

singularity-free regular vector spherical wavefunctions:

Since the VSWFs are a complete set of solutions to the vector Helmholtz equation (1), every solution
can be written as a linear combination of VSWFs. Thus, the incident ﬁeld can be written in terms of

The two sets of expansion coefﬁcients are related, since a(3)
ﬁeld expansion coefﬁcients will differ). In practice, the multipole expansion will be terminated at some
n = Nmax. For the case of multipole ﬁelds produced by an antenna that is contained within a radius a,
Nmax = ka is usually adequate, but Nmax = ka + 3 3√ka is advisable if higher accuracy is needed [21].
This can also be used as a guide for choosing Nmax for beams—if the beam waist is contained in a radius
a, this can be used to choose Nmax. Since the multipole ﬁeld necessarily deviates from the paraxial ﬁeld,
the required accuracy is open to question. It appears that a = w0 generally gives adequate results.

For focal plane matching of the ﬁelds, the regular wavefunctions are used, while for far ﬁeld match-
ing, the incoming wavefunctions are used. The use of only the incoming portion of the ﬁeld for matching
the ﬁelds in the far ﬁeld means that no knowledge of the outgoing portion of the ﬁelds is required.

If the ﬁeld expansion is truncated at n = Nmax, equation (9) or (10) contain 2(N2

known variables—the expansion coefﬁcients anm and bnm. They can be found from a set of 2(N2

2Nmax) equations. If we know the ﬁeld at enough points in space, either by using the standard paraxial
form of the beam, or from measurements, a sufﬁciently large set of equations can be generated. Since the
electric ﬁeld has three vector components at each point in space, three equations result from each point.
For robustness, extra points can be used to give an over-determined linear system which can then be

max) for surface
methods and O(N5
max) for volume methods, integral methods require a much more closely spaced grid of
points. Since we are mainly interested in strongly focussed beams, when Nmax is small, the gain in speed
through the use of a coarse grid results in improved performance. We can note that the most efﬁcient
solution to very wide beams is simply to approximate them as plane waves (an O(Nmax) solution), which
will be quite adequate if the scattering particle is small compared to the beam width, and located near
the beam axis. Optimisations for axisymmetric beams, giving O(N3
max) performance, are described later.

3 Focal plane matching

Point-matching in the focal plane offers a number of advantages. Firstly, the paraxial beam has a simple
phase structure in the focal plane. Secondly, the focal plane is likely to be the region in which scattering
or trapping takes place. Thirdly, the irradiance distribution in the focal plane may be known experi-
mentally. Although an accurate measurement of the focal plane irradiance distribution is usually quite
difﬁcult, due to the ﬁnite resolution of typical detectors, the structure of the beam, and the approximate
focal spot size, can be determined. The major disadvantage is that the greatest differences between the
paraxial beam and the real beam can be expected to occur in the focal plane. For example, a paraxial
beam has zero longitudinal components of the electric ﬁeld, but, from Maxwell’s equations, the longitu-
dinal component must be non-zero.

For mathematical convenience, we choose a coordinate system so that the beam axis coincides with
the z axis, with the beam propagating in the +z direction, with the focal plane coincident with the
xy plane (the θ = π/2 plane). Next, we can generate a grid of points, and calculate the electric ﬁeld
components of the paraxial beam at these points.

A practical difﬁculty immediately presents itself, however, since the spherical harmonics Ym
n (θ, φ)
with odd n + m are odd with respect to θ, and will be zero for θ = π/2—the focal plane. This is to
be expected physically, since the same electric ﬁeld amplitude in the focal plane can correspond to a
beam propagating in the +z direction, the
z direction, or a standing wave created by the combination
of these. A mathematically rigorous way of dealing with this is to match the derivatives of the electric
ﬁeld amplitude, as well as the ﬁeld amplitude itself. However, this isn’t necessary, since we have al-
ready chosen a direction of propagation as one of the initial assumptions. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient, and
computationally efﬁcient, to use only those VSWFs that will be non-zero to determine the corresponding
“missing” expansion coefﬁcients. This will give half of the required expansion coefﬁcients. Then, from
the direction of propagation, anm =
anm gives the “missing” coefﬁcients. If the beam
z direction, anm = bnm or bnm = anm are used. If the beam was a pure standing wave
propagates in the
combination of counter-propagating beams, these expansion coefﬁcients would be zero.

In principle, this procedure can be carried out for an arbitrary beam. However, determining the
vector components of beams where the Poynting vector is not parallel to the z axis in the focal plane will
be problematic, since there will be no unique choice of electric ﬁeld direction since the paraxial beam is
also a scalar beam. Therefore, we will restrict ourselves to beams with z-directed focal plane Poynting
vectors only. This eliminates, for example, Laguerre-Gaussian beams LGpl with l

= 0.

Often, the beam of interest will have an axisymmetric irradiance distribution. Any beam that can be
written as a sum of l = 0 Laguerre-Gaussian modes LGp0 will satisfy this criterion. The most signiﬁcant
such beam is the TEM00 Gaussian beam (which is also the LG00 beam). Beams with these properties
1 multipole components [15, 16], which follows simply from the exp(imφ) dependence
have only m =
of the VSWFs. This allows a signiﬁcant computational optimisation, since only the m =
1 VSWFs need
to be included in the point-matching procedure. This results in O(N3
max) performance.

The point-matching procedure described above was implemented using MATLAB [22]. Since the
main computational step is the solution of an overdetermined linear system, a linear algebra oriented
language/system such as MATLAB was natural choice. Additionally, existing MATLAB routines for
the calculation of Bessel, Hankel, and associated Legendre functions allow simple calculation of VSWFs.
Since the VSWFs only need to be calculated for θ = π/2, a special purpose fast VSWF calculation routine
could be used.

The general structure of a real beam point-matched with a TEM00 Gaussian beam of waist radius
w0 = 0.5λ is shown in ﬁgure 1. The beam is very similar to those given by Gouesbet’s localised approx-
imation [15, 16, 19], although the (very small) y component is somewhat different. The robustness of the
algorithm is shown by the generation of the correct z components for the ﬁnal beam, even though the
original paraxial beam was unphysically assumed to have Ez = 0.

The behaviour of the beam as it is more tightly focussed is shown in ﬁgure 2. The increasing axial
asymmetry of plane-polarised beams as they are more strongly focussed can be clearly seen. The other
feature to note is that focussed beams have a minimum waist size—the more strongly focussed beams
shown here closely approach this minimum size, the well-known diffraction limited focal spot [23,24,25].
The lack of any such limit in the paraxial beam is blatantly unphysical, and we cannot expect a beam
matched to a w0 = 0.1λ paraxial beam to have such an unreasonably small waist radius.

The Nmax for these calculations was determined by assuming that an effective radius of 3w0 contains
the entire beam in the focal plane. This gives Nmax = 16, 9, and 6 for the three beam widths of w0 = 0.5λ,

and the bottom row shows circularly-polarised beams. The beam waists vary from left to right as w0 =
0.5λ, w0 = 0.2λ, and w0 = 0.1λ. The two main features to note are the increasing axial asymmetry of the
plane-polarised beam as it is more strongly focussed, and the approach of the beam to a minimum focal
spot radius. All distances are in units of the wavelength.

w0 = 0.2λ, and w0 = 0.1λ. All VSWFs were included in the solution (that is, the axisymmetric beam
optimisation was not used), so the number of unknown variables for each case was 576, 198, and 96.
The ﬁelds were matched at a number of points equal to the number of variables, distributed on a polar
grid. This is an overdetermined system, with 50% more points than required. The times required for the
solution of the linear system on a 1.5 GHz PC were 11.2 s, 0.50 s, and 0.046 s, respectively. If the solution
is restricted to the m =
1 VSWFs, the number of variables is reduced to 4Nmax, and the times required
for the three cases shown are reduced to 0.006 s, 0.002 s, and 0.001 s.

3.2 Bi-Gaussian beam

We consider a simple non-axisymmetric beam, constructed by replacing r2 in the paraxial Gaussian beam
formula (11) by (ax)2 + (by)2, giving a bi-Gaussian irradiance distribution with an elliptical focal spot.
The expansion coefﬁcients are no longer restricted to m =

1.

The irradiance distributions of point-matched bi-Gaussian beams are shown in ﬁgure 3. The effect
of the minimum spot size is evident, as it ﬁrst restricts the focussing in the y direction, and then the x
direction, as the beam is more strongly focussed. The odd m multipole components are non-zero in these
beams. The increased width of the beam results in longer calculations using the 3w0 cutoff radius. A
smaller cutoff radius equal to w0 produces very similar results, and may be more suitable for practical

use. Since the non-zero expansion coefﬁcients can be predicted from the symmetry of the beam, it would
also be possible to speed up the calculations by only including those coefﬁcients.

direction is 2w0. All distances are in units of the wavelength.

4 Far ﬁeld matching

In the far ﬁeld, the beam becomes an inhomogeneous spherical wave. The radial component of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds vanishes. The large radius limits for the VSWFs [3]:

can be usefully employed. The far ﬁeld is best written in spherical polar coordinates, since this gives at
most two non-zero components. In cartesian coordinates, all three components will generally be non-
zero, although only two will be independent. Since only two vector components of the ﬁeld can be used
in the point matching procedure, the minimum number of points at which to match the ﬁelds that is
needed is higher.

The non-zero spherical polar vector components of the far ﬁeld beam can be obtained from the parax-

The far ﬁeld spherical wave limit of the paraxial Gaussian beam formula (11) can be found by converting
the cylindrical coordinates to spherical coordinates and taking the large r limit, giving

Focal plane irradiance contours for far ﬁeld matched beams are shown in ﬁgure 4. Except for the use
of the far ﬁeld for matching, the procedure, and the results, are the same as the focal plane matching
case.

The top row shows plane-polarised beams, with the plane of polarisation in the horizontal plane, and
the bottom row shows circularly-polarised beams. The beam waists vary from left to right as w0 = 0.5λ,
w0 = 0.2λ, and w0 = 0.1λ. All distances are in units of the wavelength.

4.2 LGpl beams

We recall that the focal plane matching procedure is greatly complicated when the Poynting vector in the
focal plane is not parallel to the beam axis, and note that the same does not apply to far ﬁeld matching—
the Poynting vector is always purely radial in the far ﬁeld regardless of its behaviour in the focal plane.
Therefore, beams of these types, such as Laguerre-Gaussian LGpl doughnut beams are best dealt with by
far ﬁeld matching. (The failure of naive attempts to model LGpl beams by focal plane matching simply
by using the correct irradiance distribution with the correct exp(imφ) azimuthal phase variation for Ex
is readily observed when attempted.) The far ﬁeld limit for Laguerre-Gaussian beams [23] is

U = U0(2ψ)(l/2)Ll

4.3 Truncation by an aperture

Truncation by an aperture is readily included by restricting non-zero values of the incoming beam to
less than the angle of the aperture. If a hard-edged aperture is assumed, a much higher Nmax is required
to accurately truncate the ﬁeld. The aperture must sufﬁciently far away for the far ﬁeld limit to be
n2/k. A soft-edged aperture may also more realistically model
accurate, which requires a distance r
the actual physical system. The effect of increasing truncation of a beam is shown in ﬁgure 6. The

beam is a circularly polarised TEM00 beam of waist radius w0 = 0.2λ. Axisymmetry was assumed,
with Nmax = 48, with the solution of the linear system requiring 0.79 s on a 1.5 GHz PC. The radiation
patterns show that the hard-edged aperture is modelled with reasonable, but not perfect accuracy. The
errors due to using a ﬁnite number of VSWFs to model the sharp edge are exactly analogous to those
seen when using a ﬁnite number of Fourier terms to model a sharp step. The increase in focal spot size
due to diffraction is clearly shown.

5 Conclusion

The point-matching method can be successfully used to obtain multipole expansion equivalents of fo-
cussed scalar paraxial beams. Multipole expansions are required for scattering calculations using the
T-matrix method or GLMT, or calculations of optical forces and torques using these method, and to be
able to obtain a satisfactory expansion of a strongly focussed laser beam that is equivalent in a mean-
ingful way to a standard paraxial laser beam is highly desirable. The method is fastest when the beams
are strongly focussed, since the maximum degree Nmax required for convergence is smaller. The method
appears usable even when the beam is focussed to the maximum possible extent. Truncation of the beam
by apertures is readily taken into account. If it is necessary to truncate the multipole expansion at Nmax
less than the value ideally required for exact representation of the beam (for example, if the T-matrix

of the scatterer is truncated at this Nmax), the multipole expansion given by the point-matching method
will be the best ﬁt, in a least squares sense, obtainable for this Nmax. If Nmax is sufﬁciently large, the
multipole expansion will be well-convergent, and the multipole ﬁeld can be made to be arbitrarily close
to the far ﬁeld/focal plane ﬁeld with which it is matched. While the multipole beam will not be equal
to the original paraxial beam over all space (only on the matching surface), the multipole beam can be
considered as a non-paraxial version of the standard beam.

While the emphasis in this paper has been on obtaining multipole expansions of standard beams, the
method used is applicable to arbitrary beams, including analytical forms of beams with corrections for
non-paraxiality. Since multipole expansions of such beams are still required for the types of scattering
calculations considered here, the point-matching method may prove useful applied to such beams. The
only restriction on the beam in question is that it must be possible to calculate the ﬁelds at a suitable
representative set of points.

Compared with integral methods, point-matching is faster for strongly focussed beams since the
method tolerates a wider grid point spacing. The chief disadvantage, compared with integral methods,
is worse performance for sufﬁciently large Nmax.

Compared with the localised approximation [15, 16, 19], point-matching is slower, but is applicable
to extremely focussed beams, and allows simple calculation for arbitrary beams, including beams with
no known analytical representation.

Practical applications typically require multipole expansions of the beam in a coordinate system cen-

10

tred on a scattering particle, rather than the beam waist as done in the examples presented here. There
are two distinct methods in which particle-centred expansions can be determined. Firstly, it should be
noted that there is no requirement in the point-matching method for the beam waist to coincide with
the xy plane and the beam axis to coincide with the z axis. Therefore, coordinate axes can be chosen to
coincide with the scattering particle, and the points in the focal plane or far ﬁeld at which the ﬁelds are
matched speciﬁed in this particle-centred coordinate system. This is simply done for focal plane match-
ing. For far ﬁeld matching, we note that translation of the coordinate system by x is equivalent to a phase
shift of kx
ˆr at the points in the far ﬁeld. A larger Nmax will typically be required for convergence since
a larger radius is required to contain the beam waist when the beam waist is not centred on the origin.

We also note that the paraxial beam waist is a rather misleading parameter to use the describe the
multipole beam given by the point-matching procedure, since the actual beam wasit of the multipole
beam will differ from that of the paraxial beam. To be able to caclulate a multipole beam of a given
waist radius from a paraxial beam, it is necessary to know what paraxial beam waist corresponds to
the actual beam waist. Graphs comparing the paraxial and observed waists are given in ﬁgure 7. For

is the point at E(r) = E0/ exp(

In conclusion, a reasonable solution to the problem of multipole representation of strongly focussed
laser beams is presented. Although the VSWF expansions are not identical to the paraxial beams from
which they are derived, they are related in a natural manner. These beams are of particular interest for
optical trapping and scattering by single particles within optical traps.

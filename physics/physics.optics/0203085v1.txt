ABSTRACT

We use the variational method to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the

stationary pulselike solutions in birefringent ﬁbers when diﬀerences in both phase veloc-

ities and group velocities between the two components and rapidly oscillating terms are

taken into account. After checking the validity of the approximation we study how the

soliton pulse shape depends on its velocity and nonlinear propagation constant. By nu-

merically solving the propagation equation we have found that most of these stationary

solutions are stable.

1 Introduction

Pulse propagation in nonlinear birefringent optical ﬁbers is presently an active area of

research [1-12].Even “single-mode” ﬁbers support two degenerate modes polarized in

two orthogonal directions. The degeneracy can be broken introducing deliberately a

large amount of birefringence through design modiﬁcations giving place to the so called

polarization-preserving ﬁbers. Weak light pulses propagating in these media maintain its

state of polarization when they are initially polarized along either of the principal axes.

However at high intensities nonlinear birefringence can change drastically the propaga-

tion dynamics. Birefringence can also be a residual eﬀect due to imperfections in the

manufacturing process.

The equations that govern pulse propagation in nonlinear birefringent pulses have

been derived by Menyuk [13]. Two main cases of birefringence: i) high and ii) low, have

been usually considered separately. In the approximation of high birefringence [13, 14],

phase and group velocities of both ﬁeld components are considered to be diﬀerent. At

the same time rapidly oscillating nonlinear terms are neglected. On the other hand, the

approximation of low birefringence takes into account the diﬀerence in phase velocities

between the two linearly polarized components, but neglects their diﬀerence in group

velocities. The full polarization dynamics of solitons in this last approximation has been

studied in [11].

The general case has been analyzed in just a few papers [1, 6, 15]. New vectorial

stationary solitons for this case were ﬁrst discovered in [6], and later on the whole family

of stationary pulselike solutions was numerically determined by Torner et al. [1]. These

2

families of solitons correspond to mutually trapped pulses that propagate with a common

group velocity and which therefore can be called walking vector solitons [16]. Stationary

solutions as singular points of this inﬁnite dimensional dynamical system play a pivotal

role to understand the propagation dynamics of any arbitrary input pulse. Here we

generalize the method described in [14] to ﬁnd accurate analytical approximations of

the solitary wave solutions for the case of high birefringence. We generalize it for the

more general case, when no terms are neglected. Our approximate results are compared

with existing exact ones [1, 6] to prove the validity of our approach. We then examine

the behavior of the two pulse components when the propagation constant (q) or the

velocity (v) change. We ﬁnd that the width of the pulses is determined by q whereas

the amplitudes ratio a1/a2 is determined by v when the energy is higher than a certain

value. By means of numerical propagation of the stationary solutions found in this way,

we observe that most of them are stable.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The problem to be addressed by the

variational method is described in section 2. Our variational approach is developed in

section 3. In section 4 we present the numerical results and ﬁnally in section 5 we brieﬂy

summarize the main conclusions.

2 Statement of the problem

Pulse propagation in a birefringent optical ﬁber can be described in terms of two non-

linearly coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations.

In a reference frame traveling along

the ξ axis with the average group velocity, and in normalized units, this set takes the

3

form [13, 15]

where U and V are the slowly varying envelopes of the two linearly components of the

ﬁeld along the x and y axis respectively, ξ is the normalized propagation coordinate, δ

is the inverse group velocity diﬀerence, β is half the diﬀerence between the propagation

constants, A is the normalized ratio of the nonlinear susceptibilities, B = 1 − A, τ is

the normalized retarded time, and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. In linearly

birefringent ﬁbers A = 2/3, as we set here. The set of Eqs.1 has at least three integrals of

motion [6], i) the action (total energy), ii) the momentum and iii) the Hamiltonian, which

are a consequence of i)the translational invariance of Eqs.(1) relative to phase shifts, ii)

invariance in τ and iii) translational invariance in ξ.

Eqs.1 have two simple linearly polarized pulselike solutions, viz., linearly polarized

soliton waves along the slow axis

The stability of these solutions has been determined in Ref.[11] for δ = 0, and for arbitrary

nonzero values of δ in Ref.[6].

Usually Eqs.1 are written without the last two terms [13], as terms with coeﬃcient β

can be eliminated by z dependent phase transformations of U and V , and this in turn

gives the last nonlinear terms rapid phase variations with z which in principle allow their

neglect. We must however bear in mind that the last terms in Eq.1 are the only ones

responsible for energy transfer between both polarizations. And although averaging out

the fast oscillatory terms has proven to be a good approximation to describe most of the

observed phenomena [3, 4, 17] in the picosecond regime, we will go further in retaining

these terms in the analysis.

3 Variational approach

The variational approach when applied to the single Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation

(NLS) was introduced by Anderson [18]. Since then it has been widely used for coupled

NLS equations. For the speciﬁc case of birefringent ﬁbers in the high birefringence ap-

proximation it has been used for studying dynamical behaviors [4, 8, 19, 20, 21], as well

as the stationary case [14].

reference. They can be written [1] as

We look for stationary solutions moving at a common velocity v in our frame of

U(τ ′, ξ) = P1(τ ′) exp (i q ξ)

V (τ ′, ξ) = P2(τ ′) exp (i q ξ)

(5)

5

where τ ′ = τ − vξ is the common retarded time. Inserting Eqs. 5 into Eqs.1, we get a set

of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODE’s) for P1,2, which reads

We now assume the following ansatz for P1,2

i = 1, 2.

(8)

Where the variational parameters a1,2, b1,2, and c1,2 are assumed to have real values. The

above ansatz is inspired from solutions 2, and 3, as well as from the work of Par´e [14].

We know that the exact solution has a complex phase chirp [1] induced by the four wave

mixing term (last term in Eqs.1), which we neglect for simplicity but also because from

previous numerical calculations we observed that the phase dependence on τ ′ was mainly

lineal [6].

By introducing Eqs.8 into Eqs.7, and applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the

averaged Lagrangian one obtains, after some straightforward algebra, a set of six nonlinear

In order to simplify the set of equations 9 - 14, we need to do some assumptions

and approximations. We ﬁrst take into account [1, 6] that the main contribution to c−

becomes from 2δ, while the integral is a minor correction. Therefore, using the ﬁrst order

B¨orn approximation [22] c− becomes

Introducing Eq.19 into Eqs.11 - 14 we get a reduced set of four nonlinear equations. The

next step must consist in ﬁnding accurate analytical expressions for the integrals I, m,

The same Taylor expansion for M or I gives much more complicated expressions in terms

of Polygamma functions [23], which should be evaluated numerically.

Instead of this

approach we choose to approximate M and I by replacing bi by (b1 + b2)/2. In this way

where b = b1 + b2.

From here the procedure goes as follow. Given the equation coeﬃcients δ, β, A(= 2/3),

and B(= 1/3), together with the parameters v and q, we solve the Eqs.11 -14 to obtain

b1,2, and a1,2. Then c1,2 are obtained from Eqs.9- 10.

4 Numerical results

We have numerically solved the four coupled nonlinear algebraic equations by a Powell

hybrid method [24].

In all cases a unique solution was instantaneoulsy obtained.

In

order to check the validity of the approximations used to solve the integrals we sometimes

evaluated numerically M, m, and I at each step getting almost identical results but with

a much higher CPU time consumption.

Fig.1 shows the dependence of the soliton energy Q on the nonlinear propagation

constant q. This diagram was obtained by means of the above described variational

method. The solid lines represent the solutions given by Eqs. 4. Diﬀerent sets of almost

parallel curves correspond to diﬀerent values of the parameter δ whilst the value of v

hardly inﬂuences the shape of these curves, ﬁxing solely the minimum allowed value of q.

These curves coincide totally with those shown in ﬁg.1(a) of Ref.[6], which were obtained

exactly by numerically solving the propagation equation for certain values of q whatever

v was.

In addition to the solutions approximated by Eq.8, where a1,2 were assumed to be real,

and therefore represent solutions where U and V are in phase, there exist solutions where

U and V are π/2 out of phase [1]. They can be obtained directly from our variational

approach if we do not imposed a1,2 to be real. Alternatively our approach can account

for them just by changing the ansatz (Eq.8 for Pi). If we choose the following one:

˜P1 = a1sech(b1 τ ′)exp(i c1τ ′)

˜P2 = a2sech(b2 τ ′)exp(i(c2τ ′ + π/2)),

(24)

9

and repeat the process, it is easily realized that the only change produced in the nonlinear

algebraic equations is to replace B by −B. This indicates that the existence of these

independent solutions is intimately related to the inclusion of the four wave mixing term

in the propagation equations.

Figure 2 shows the fraction of energy in the slow mode (Q1/Q) versus the total en-

ergy (Q) of the two-parameter family of solutions for δ = β = 1 as obtained from our

variational method. In (a) and (b) Pi is given by Eq.8 and Eq. 24 respectively. The results

can be compared with the exact ones in Fig. 1 of Ref.[1], which were found numerically.

The symmetry of these curves is a result of the symmetry that possesses the Lagrangian

(25)

Figs. 1, and 2 illustrate the accuracy of the variational approach as developed in the

section 3. We must remark that solving the set of four nonlinear algebraic equations is an

easy task that can be done really fast. In our computer (Alpha Dec 2100/500) we obtain

thousands of these variational solutions in just a few CPU seconds.

Fig. 3 shows the variation of the width ratio (η = b1/b2) vs. the propagation constant

q for the stationary solutions when U and V are (a) in phase, and (b) in quadrature.

We take β = δ = 1, and three values of v are considered, which are written close to the

corresponding curves. In all cases η tends to 1 as q increases, i.e.

for high values of Q

(see Fig. 1). The departure of η from unity is higher when U and V are in quadrature

than when they are in phase. In any case it is small except around the minimum allowed

10

value of q, where the curves emerge and one of the components (V in the cases of ﬁgure 3)

is almost zero. This ﬁgure serves also to verify a posteriori that our approximations of

integrals I, m and M had good basis.

Similarly Fig.4 shows (a) c2 −c1 and (b) c2 vs. q for the same values of the parameters.

As expected, at the minimum value allowed for q, where the solution is a fast soliton

(Eq.3), c2 is exactly δ + v. As it occurred for Q vs. q, the value of c− hardly depends

on v, being mainly determined by the value of q. It is also remarkable that while the

solutions for U and V in phase decrease its frequency diﬀerence (i.e. c−) as we increase

q (and therefore Q), the opposite happens for the solutions with U and V in quadrature.

In these last cases c− becomes more diﬀerent to 2δ than when U and V are in phase. The

same happened with η respect to 1 (see Fig. 3). In fact we observe that the variational

solutions were much more accurate for the solutions with U and V in phase than for those

in quadrature.

Fig.5 shows the variation of the widths and peak amplitudes vs. q for the solutions

with U and V in phase.

It can be seen that for a given value of δ and β, the widths

depend almost exclusively on q, being almost completely independent on v. On the other

hand the asymptotic behavior of a1/a2 does not depend on q but only on v (see Fig.5c).

We have numerically solved Eqs.1, taking as initial conditions the variational solutions

corresponding to diﬀerent values of the parameters v and q and ﬁxed values of δ and

β, viz. β = 1 = δ.

In all cases that we propagate in-phase solutions, we obtained

stable propagation, whilst π/2-dephased solutions were sometimes unstable. Fig. 6 shows

the stable propagation of the in-phase variational solution for q = 3.2 and v = 0.9,

11

whereas Fig.7 shows the same for the π/2-dephased solution corresponding to q = 6 and

v = 0.9. Contrary to the previous case, a small diﬀerence can be appreciated between the

variational solution and the stationary one. The exact stable stationary solution (which

of course is π/2-dephased) is reached after a very short propagation distance. Finally

Fig. 8 illustrates the unstable behavior of a π/2-dephased solution (q = 7.2, v = 0.8).

The solution oscillates around the stationary solution with increasing amplitude emitting a

small quantity of radiation. Eventually, after the emisssion of a large quantity of radiation,

a stable solution is reached (not shown in the ﬁgure). In Figs. 6-8 τ ′′ = τ + δ.

5 Summary

We have developed an accurate variational approach to derive analytical approximations

of the coupled pulselike stationary solutions in birefringent ﬁbers in the most general

case when diﬀerences in both phase velocities and group velocities between the two com-

ponents and fastly oscillatory terms are taken into account (they are important in the

subpicosecond regime). As particular cases it includes those where any term in Eqs.1 can

be neglected. We have shown that the diﬀerence between the central frequencies of the

components, their widht and their energies are almost independent on v, being mainly

determined by q. We have also shown that the ratio a1/a2 is mainly determined by v.

The stability of these solutions has been brieﬂy considered, by numerically propagating

them. In all the cases we propagated solution in-phase, they happened to be stable whilst

those π/2 out of phase present some intervals of stability. A global stability analysis of

these solutions remains to be done. This variational method could be useful to design

We demonstrate experimentally that the interactions between a pair of nonlocal spatial optical
solitons in a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) can be controlled by the degree of nonlocality. For a
given beam width, the degree of nonlocality can be modulated by varying the pretilt angle of NLC
molecules via the change of the bias. When the pretilt angle is smaller than π/4, the nonlocality
is strong enough to guarantee the independence of the interactions on the phase diﬀerence of the
solitons. As the pretilt angle increases, the degree of nonlocality decreases. When the degree is
below its critical value, the two solitons behavior in the way like their local counterpart: the two
in-phase solitons attract and the two out-of-phase solitons repulse.

PACS numbers: 42.70.Df

The interaction properties of two optical solitons
depend on the phase diﬀerence between them, their
coherence,1,2 as well as the nonlinear nonlocality of the
materials where the solitons propagate. For the local
Kerr-type nonlinearity, the two coherent bright solitons
attract (or repulse) each other when they are in-phase
(or out-of-phase). On the other hand, if the solitons are
mutually incoherent3 or the nonlinear nonlocality of the
materials is strong enough,4,5 the soliton interaction is
always attractive, independent of the phase diﬀerence.
Ku et al.2 demonstrated both theoretically and experi-
mentally that the interaction of the solitons can be con-
trolled by varying their total coherence, and the two out-
of-phase solitons can repulse or attract, depending on
the coherence parameter is below a threshold or above
it. Such a similar interaction property of the dependence
on nonlocality was also theoretically predicted6 based on
the (1+1)-D mode of the nematic liquid crystal (NLC)—
there is a critical degree of nonlocality above which the
two out-of-phase solitons attract.

The NLC with the pretilt induced by an external low-
frequency electric ﬁeld has been conﬁrmed7,8 to be one
of the materials with the strongly nonlocal nonlinearity.4
However, in the previous works about the single soliton
propagation7,8,9 and the soliton interaction5,6 in NLC,
the peak of the pretilt angle is always made be π/4 in
order to maximum the nonlinearity. As will be seen
here, the degree of the nonlinear nonlocality can mod-
ulated only by changing the beam width in this case.
It is not convenient in practice. Peccianti et al. have
shown that10 the nonlocality can be varied by changing
the pretilt angle via changing a bias voltage. In this let-
ter, we use the (1+2)-D model with the arbitrary pretilt
angle10 to describe the (1+2)-D soliton interaction in
NLC. We deﬁne a general characteristic length of the
nonlinear nonlocality of the material NLC. As a result,
the voltage-controllable degree of nonlocality is shown to
be achieved conveniently. We experimentally observe the

voltage-controllable (through the change of the bias volt-
age) transition from attraction to repulsion of the two
out-of-phase solitons in NLC.

We consider the (1+2)-D model of light propagation
in a cell containing NLC. The conﬁguration of the cell
and the coordinate system are as same as in the previous
works.7,8,9,10 The optical ﬁelds with envelope A prop-
agates in z-direction, polarized in x-axis. An external
low-frequency electric ﬁeld ERF is applied in x-direction
to control the initial tilt angle. The evolution of the
paraxial beam A and the tilt angle θ can be described by
the system7,11

x2 + y2),
where K0 is the zero-th order modiﬁed Bessel function.
We deﬁne wm in Eq. (6) as the general characteris-
tic length of the nonlinear nonlocality of the material
NLC,13 then we can see the factor α in Eq. (9) indicates
the degree of nonlocality, as deﬁned for the speciﬁc case
of Gaussion response function in Ref.14. A monotonous
function of θ0 on ERF is given by Eq. (3), and can be ap-
proximated as θ0 ≈ π/2[1 − (EF R/ERF )3] when ERF is
higher than the Fre`ederichsz threshold EF R.10 Then, we
can clearly observe from Eq. (6), as shown in Fig.1, that
wm is determined only by ERF , that is by the bias, or
equivalently by the peak-pretilt angle θ0 for a given NLC
cell conﬁguration. When the bias is made be a properly-
chosen ﬁxed value so that θ0 = π/4,7 wm is ﬁxed, and the
degree of nonlocality α can be modulated only by chang-
ing the beam width w0, which does be the case discussed
in Ref.6. But for a given beam width, α can continuously
be changed via wm changing by continuously varying the
bias. As a result, the voltage-controlled degree of nonlo-
cality through the medium of the pretilt θ0 of the NLC
can be achieved conveniently. With the decrease of the
bias, θ0 goes from π/2 to 0, then α varies from ∞ to 0 for
a ﬁxed w0 and the degree of nonlocality increases from
locality to strong nonlocality.

In addition, we can see the factor γ in Eq. (9) stands
for the nonlinear couple between A and Ψ, and it reaches
maximum when θ0 = π/4, which takes major responsi-
bility for the lowest critical power4,14 of a single soliton
nearby θ0 = π/4, as shown in Fig.1B. As the pretilt angle

approach π/2, the critical power increases quickly, while
wm decreases to zero and α increases to ∞ for the given
w0.

To show the inﬂuence of the pretilt angle θ0 (equiva-
lently the degree of nonlocality α for a ﬁxed w0) on the
interaction of the two solitons, we carry out the numerical
simulation directly based on the original equations (1),
(2), and (3). The simulations show that the critical non-
locality, below which the two out-of-phase solitons begin
to attract, depends on the initial separation and relative
angle in the (y, z)-plane of the solitons. The critical non-
locality for the two parallel solitons is very weak so that
the pretilt angle θ0 should be very close to π/2, which
leads a very high critical power. But the relative angle
will increase much more the critical nonlocality. Figure 2
shows the simulations of two solitons with the relative
angle of 0.57o. We can see that for θ0 ≤ π/4, the non-
locality is strong enough to guarantee the attraction of
both the in-phase and the out-of-phase solitons. When
θ0 = 0.45π, the nonlocality is lower than the critical non-
locality, then the out-of-phase solitons repulse each other
and the in-phase solitons attract.

Figure 3 shows the experimental setup. The laser from
an argon-ion laser is split into two beams, then they are
combined together with a small separation through the
other beam-splitter and incident into a 80µm-thick NLC
cell by a 10× microscope objective. The beam width at

focus w0, the separation d and relative angle β between
the two beams are measured by an edged-scanning beam
proﬁler when NLC cell is removed. The phase diﬀerence
between the two beams is adjusted by the rotation of a
1.8mm-thick parallel-face plate, and measured through
the interference pattern by the beam proﬁler locating on
the other branch after the second beam-splitter. The
cell is ﬁlled with nematic liquid crystal TEB30A (from
SLICHEM China Ltd.), for which nk = 1.6924, n⊥ =
1.5221, K ≈ 10−11N , ǫop
a = 9.4ǫ0.
The Fre`edericksz threshold Vt ≈ 1.14V for the 80µm-
thick cell. The launched power of each beam is ﬁxed to
7mW when the bias changes, and the other parameters
for the beams in NLC are w0 = 3.2µm, d = 10µm, and
tan β = 0.011. When the phase diﬀerence is adjusted to 0
or π, we take pictures of the beam traces for the diﬀerent
biases, as shown in Fig.4.

1.4V (θ0 ≈ π/4). They are almost same for the in-phase
and the out-of-phase cases. It means for θ0 = π/4 the
nonlocality is strong enough to guarantee the indepen-
dence of the interactions on the phase diﬀerence of the
solitons. In this case, wm ≈ 25.3µm, which is bigger than
the separation of the two beams, and α = 0.126 for the
3.2µm-width solitons.

For the bias V = 1.0V sightly lower than the thresh-
old Vt = 1.14V (a small tilt angle in the sample educes
some reorientation at the bias voltage lower than the
threshold10), the pretilt angle θ0 is nearly zero and non-
locality is much stronger than that when V = 1.4V. So
we can see the second cross point for both the in-phase
and the out-of-phase solitons.

When the bias V (pretilt angle θ0) increases, the degree
of nonlocality α and material length wm decrease. For
V = 2.4V (θ0 ≈ 0.45π), we have wm ≈ 11µm, approxi-
mately equaling to the separation of the two solitons. We
observe the attraction of the in-phase solitons, as well as
the repulsion of the out-of-phase solitons. We also see
the two in-phase solitons fused into one soliton, which is
qualitatively same with the numerical simulation result
in Fig. 2.

In conclusion, we investigate theoretically and experi-
mentally the interactions of the nonlocal spatial optical
solitons in the NLC when the bias is adjusted. Given
is a general deﬁnition of the characteristic length of the
NLC nonlinear nonlocality, which is the function of the
bias via the pretilt angle. Then, the voltage-controllable
degree of nonlocality in the NLC can be implemented
expediently. We experimentally observe the transition
from attraction to repulsion of the two out-of-phase soli-
tons in NLC as the degree of nonlocality decreases via
varying the bias. Such a voltage-controllable property of
the soliton interaction might have its potential usefulness
in developing all-optical signal processing devices.

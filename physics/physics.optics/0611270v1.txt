Abstract

We study the scintillation index of N partially overlapping collimated lowest order Gaussian laser

beams with diﬀerent wavelengths in weak atmospheric turbulence. Using the Rytov approximation

we calculate the initial beam separation that minimizes the longitudinal scintillation. Further

reduction of the longitudinal scintillation is obtained by optimizing with respect to both beam

separation and spot size. The longitudinal scintillation of the optimal N -beam conﬁgurations is

inversely proportional to N , resulting in a 92% reduction for a 9-beam system compared with

the single beam value. The radial scintillation values for the optimal N -beam conﬁgurations are

signiﬁcantly smaller than the corresponding single beam values.

INTRODUCTION

Propagation of light through atmospheric turbulence is the subject of intensive research

owing to the many applications in free space laser communications [1]. In these applications

it is desirable to reduce the turbulence eﬀects on the propagating light. One promising pos-

sibility to achieve this goal is by using temporally partially coherent optical ﬁeld consisting

of multiple laser beams with diﬀerent wavelengths [2, 3, 4, 5]. Indeed, in a typical setup in

which the detector’s response time is large compared with the inverse of the frequency dif-

ference between any pair of beams in the input ﬁeld, rapidly oscillating contributions to the

total intensity average out. Consequently, one can expect smaller values of high moments of

the intensity compared with corresponding single beam values. This would result in smaller

values for the scintillation index and for the average signal to noise ratio (SNR).

Generation of temporally partially coherent light consisting of multiple beams with dif-

ferent wavelengths can be eﬃciently realized by using an array of vertical external cavity

surface lasers (VECSELs). These devices have the advantage of generating high power,

spectrally narrow, wavelength tunable TEM00 beams (lowest order Gaussian beams)[6].

Propagation of temporally partially coherent light in atmospheric turbulence was ﬁrst

studied by Fante [7, 8], who obtained approximate analytic expressions for the scintillation

index of a single inﬁnite planar wave. More recently Kiasaleh studied propagation of an

inﬁnite multi-wavelength planar wave in weak atmospheric turbulence and showed that the

achievable SNR is larger in the multi-wavelength case compared with the single-wavelength

case [2, 3]. These previous studies focused on inﬁnite planar waves, whereas in practice,

Gaussian laser beams with ﬁnite initial spot size are employed. Since the dynamics of

the optical ﬁeld can strongly depend on the initial spot size it is important to take into

account the ﬁnite spatial dimension of the beams. Furthermore, the optical ﬁeld of N

collimated TEM00 beams with diﬀerent wavelengths depends on the wavelength separation

and also on the spatial separation between the beam centers at the transmitter. Therefore,

one can exploit these two diﬀerent dependences to reduce scintillation and optimize system

performance against turbulence eﬀects. The dependence of the scintillation index on the

wavelength separation of multiple overlapping TEM00 beams was studied in Ref. [4]. It was

found that for typical lasercom setups modest scintillation reduction of about 10% can be

acheived by controlling the wavelength diﬀerence between the beams. We emphasize that

2

only the case where the beams are completely overlapping at the transmitter plane was

considered in Ref.

[4]. In the current Letter we focus attention on scintillation reduction

by varying the spatial separation between the beams at the transmitter. We show that this

approach leads to a much stronger decrease of the scintillation compared with the approach

employed in Ref. [4]. Moreover, our approach allows us to ﬁnd the initial beam separation

that minimizes scintillation, thus providing a simple solution for the important problem of

optimizing temporally partially coherent sources of light against turbulence eﬀects.

In Ref.

[5] we took the ﬁrst step in this approach and established the framework for

calculating the scintillation index for multiple partially overlapping beams in weak atmo-

spheric turbulence. Using the Rytov approximation and considering a typical 2-beam sys-

tem we found the initial beam separation that minimizes the longitudinal scintillation. We

showed that the longitudinal and radial scintillation for the optimal 2-beam conﬁguration

are smaller by about 50% and 35%-40%, respectively, compared with the corresponding

single-beam values. However, two important aspects of the problem were not addressed in

Ref. [5]: (1) the N-dependence of the longitudinal scintillation reduction compared with the

single-beam case, and (2) the possibility to optimize the system with respect to both initial

beam separation and initial spot size. In this Letter we address these two central issues in

detail.

II. CALCULATION OF THE SCINTILLATION INDEX

Consider propagation of N collimated linearly polarized TEM00 beams with diﬀer-

ent wavelengths λj, j = 1, ..., N, in weak atmospheric turbulence. Assuming that the

beams propagate along the z axis and denoting by dj the beam-center locations at the

input plane z = 0, the magnitude of the total electric ﬁeld E at z = 0 is E(r, 0, t) =

N

j=1 Uj(rj, 0) exp [−iωjt], where Uj(rj, 0) = exp[−r2

0j], r is the radius vector in the xy
plane, rj ≡ r − dj, t is time, kj = 2π/λj are wavenumbers, ωj = kjc are angular frequencies,
P

j /W 2

and c is the speed of light. In addition, W0j are the initial spot sizes and we assume that all

beams have the same amplitude. Assuming weak turbulence, the propagation is described

by N uncoupled linear wave equations

where n1(r, z) represents the refractive index ﬂuctuations, |n1(r, z)| ≪ 1. To solve Eq. (1)

we follow Ref. [1] and employ the paraxial approximation together with the Huygens-Fresnel

integral and the second order (with respect to n1) Rytov perturbation method. The total

intensity at z = L is

of the spectral density of the refractive index ﬂuctuations Φn(κ) over wavenumber κ and

j (rj, L)i = hIj(rj, L)i2 exp [H2j(rj, L)] ,

where H2j is given by another double integral of Φn(κ) over κ and z.

hIj(rj, L)Im(rm, L)i = hIj(rj, L)ihIm(rm, L)i ×

where E2jm, E2mj and E3jm are three diﬀerent integrals of Φn(κ) over κ and z.

[See Ref.

We consider two typical free space laser communication setups, in which the central
wavelength is λc = 10−6m, the wavelength spacing is ∆λ = 10−8m, all beams are collimated

and have the same initial spot size and on-axis amplitude. In setup A L = 1km and the
n = 3.0 × 10−15m−2/3, and in setup B L = 10km
refractive index structure parameter is C 2
n = 10−16m−2/3. Both setups correspond to weak atmospheric turbulence conditions,
and C 2

are used.

For even N we consider initial conﬁgurations in which the beam centers are located on

a circle with diameter d centered about the z-axis with equal angles between dj−1 and dj.

Thus, for N = 4, for example, the centers are at d1 = dˆx/2, d1 = dˆy/2, d1 = −dˆx/2, and

d1 = −dˆy/2. For odd N we consider the same geometry as in the N − 1 case, with an

additional beam on the z-axis.

The d-dependence of the longitudinal scintillation for 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 8-, and 9-beam con-

ﬁgurations in setup A with initial spot sizes W0 = 1cm is shown in Fig. 1 together with

the corresponding value for a single TEM00 beam with the same total power and initial
spot size. One can see that in each of the N ≥ 2 cases the σ2

2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 8-, and 9-beam conﬁgurations, respectively. These minima correspond to the

optimal conﬁgurations of the N beams for the given physical conditions and geometric ar-

rangements, where optimization is with respect to longitudinal scintillation. Comparison

with the single-beam value shows that the longitudinal scintillation is reduced by 53.4%,

63.2%, 82.2%, 84.4%, 88.1%, and 92.0% for the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 8-, and 9-beam optimal con-

ﬁgurations, respectively. Moreover, analysis of the longitudinal scintillation values for the
optimal conﬁgurations shows that σ2

I,l decreases like 1/N with increasing N.

An important question concerns the possibility to further reduce the scintillation by

optimizing with respect to the initial spot size. This question is addressed in Fig. 2, which

shows the d-dependence of the longitudinal scintillation for diﬀerent W0 values for a 5-beam
system in setup B. One can see that the minimum value of σ2

I,l ﬁrst decreases with increasing
W0 and then increases. Hence, the optimal conﬁguration for the 5-beam system in setup B,

is the one with W0 ≃4cm and d0 = 13.2cm. Notice that the ﬁnal free space spot size of the

beams for the optimal conﬁguration in this case is only 8.8cm.

When the spot size is comparable with the radius of the receiver’s collecting lens, the

radial scintillation becomes important. In this case it is essential to understand whether the

radial scintillation of the optimal N-beam conﬁgurations, where optimization is with respect

to longitudinal scintillation, is suﬃciently small compared with the single-beam value. Notice
that in the N-beam case σ2

r (r, L) is not radially symmetric. To enable comparison with the
single-beam case we deﬁne the circularly averaged radial scintillation in the N-beam case as

rr for the optimal 4- and 2-beam conﬁgurations and for a single beam with the

same power and initial spot size, all in setup A. One can see that the radial scintillation for

the optimal 4-beam and 2-beam conﬁgurations are smaller by about 65%-80% and 35%-40%,

respectively, compared with the corresponding single beam values. Therefore, optimization

of the N-beam conﬁgurations with respect to the longitudinal scintillation leads to signiﬁcant

reduction in the radial scintillation, and this reduction eﬀect grows with increasing N.

III. CONCLUSION

We calculated the scintillation index for an array of N partially overlapping collimated

TEM00 beams with diﬀerent wavelengths in weak atmospheric turbulence using the Rytov

perturbation method. We showed that both the longitudinal and the radial scintillation can

be signiﬁcantly reduced compared with the corresponding single-beam values by optimizing

the beam array with respect to initial beam separation and spot size. These reduction eﬀects

grow with increasing N, resulting in a 92% reduction in the longitudinal scintillation for an

optimal 9-beam system.

Abstract

We measured the polarized and azimuthal dependencies of optical second har-

monics generation (SHG) on polished surfaces of ZnSe(100) single crystal sur-

face in air, using a fundamental wavelength of 1.06µm. By considering both,

the bulk- and surface- optical nonlinearities within the electric dipole approx-

imation, we analysed the data for all four combination of p- and s-polarized

incidence and output. The measurement using Sin −
ularly useful in the determining of the symmetry ZnSe(100)/contamination

Sout is thereby partic-

layer-interface, which would lower the eﬀective symmetry of ZnSe(100) from

C4v to C2v. The analysis of p-incident and p-output conﬁguration allows us

to distinguish the [011]- and [011]- directions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Optical Second Harmonic Generation(SHG) has matured to be an eﬀective surface- and

interface-sensitive technique for probing a large variety of surface- and interface-properties.

This technique is a non-destructive.

It can be used for in-situ measurements in almost

any environment, provided that we have optical access to the sample [1,?,?]. The method

bases on the idea that generally a surface and a bulk have diﬀerent structural symmetry

1

[2,?,?,?]. Materials with inversion symmetry, such as Si- and Ge- single crystals have no

bulk electric-dipole contribution. Electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole contributions

originate the leading source in SHG from the bulk. However, a surface or an interface

breaks the inversion symmetry and produces an electric-dipole contribution. Generally the

SHG-intensity from a surface or an interface can be compared to be much greater than

that from the bulk, depending on the material, the photon energy, and the geometry of

the experiment. On the other hand, noncentrosymmetric materials like crystals with the

zincblende structure as, e.g. the compound semiconductors GaAs and ZnSe, have intense

bulk electric-dipole contributions to the SHG, thus hampering surface observations. Stehlin

et al [5] illustrated possible combinations of the polarization of incident and SHG output

light and of crystal azimuths for which only the surface contribution may be deduced for

typical low index surface, e.g. (001), (110), and (111) and used SHG as eﬀective surface

probe with submonolayer sensitivity to monitor the adsorption of Sn on GaAs(001) surface.

Later, S. R. Armstrong et al [7] investigated by means of SHG a GaAs(100)/air interface.

Similar experiments performed by C. Yamada and T. Kimura [8,?] ﬁrstly observed the

twofold rotational angledependence (rotation anisotropy) of SHG in the reﬂected light from

a well prepared and by RHEED characterised noncentrosymmetric single crystal surface

of GaAs(100). They interpreted it as the interference of surface SHG and dipole-allowed

bulk SHG having fourfold symmetry results in twofold anisotropy, whereby the degree of

rotational anisotropy monitors the surface reconstruction. Galeckas et al [10] showed that

SHG in reﬂection is a sensitive and practical method to invesigate the departure from perfect

crystalline ofder at the surface by studying the SHG rotational anisotropy of crystalline,

polycrystalline and amorphous silicon carbide surfaces. Bottomley et al [11] determined to

within

0.1◦ the orientation of vicinal GaAs(001) and Si(111) single crystal wafers using

±

second and third harmonic generation. M. Takebayash et al [12] demonstrated the SHG-

measurement of the tilt angle θ of the crystallographic axis of a vicinal GaAs(100) wafer

towards a direction ξ that characterises step direction and step height and forms an angle

ψ with respect to [100]-axis and found that the s-incident polarization is useful in the

2

determination of this tilt angle. C. Jordan et al [13] used the azimuthal rotational anisotropy

of the SHG for in-situ ﬁnger print characterisation of various polytypes of SiC and compared

with X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and identify defect regions in big samples by observating the

spatially resolved dependence of the SH-intensity.

In recent years, there has been big interest in wide-band gap II-VI compound semi-

conductors.

In particular, ZnSe is being actively studied due to their electroluminescent

properties in blue-light-emitting laser diodes [?]. These devices are fabricated by epitax-

ial growth on GaAs substrates. The replacement of GaAs substrates by ZnSe ones may

decrease the concerntration of defects and increase the lifetime of the device. This can

be one possible way to improve ZnSe-based laser characteristics. An recent observation in

ZnSe/ZnCdSe laser diodes grown onto ZnSe substrates indicates that the growth rate of the

defects is much smaller than for layers grown onto GaAs substrates [15]. For the successful

growth of II-VI epilayers onto ZnSe layers is very importment to have well ordered substrate

surfaces. However, the superiority of ZnSe substrates over GaAs one has not been realised

yet, mainly because it is diﬃcult to obtain high-quality ZnSe substrates.

SHG has been successfully applied to the study of semiconductor surfaces semiconduc-

tor/semiconductor heterostructures and interfaces, and semiconductor-oxide interfaces [1]

and provides a powerful tool for understanding the energetics of various defect formations

and surface reconstructions. Although these experiments have been performed mostly for

GaAs surface [5,7–9] or SiC surface [10,13], similar symmetric studies were not extend to

many other non-centrosymmetric materials, such as ZnSe.

In this paper, we have measured the SH intensity from ZnSe(100) as a function of the light

polarization and as a function of the azimuthal angle. We have also calculated the intensity

of SHG from the surface electric dipoles and the the second-order nonlinear polarization

arising from the bulk response. We use optical SHG to determine the macroscopic symmetry

properties of the ZnSe(100)/air interface. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In Sec.

II, the theory for SHG in reﬂection from the bulk and surface of nonsymmetric

crystals is brieﬂy introduced. Then the experimental apparatus is described in Sec. III, and

3

ﬁnally the results are analyzed in terms of symmetry.

II. THEORY

A. General

We can express the induced nonlinear surface polarization at an interface in the following

manner: [5]

Pef f (2ω) = Psurf + PbulkF (ω)F (2ω)Lef f,

(1)

where F (ω) and F (2ω) are the Fresnel factors for the incident input and output ﬁelds, and

Lef f = (W + 2w)−1 is the eﬀective phase-matching distance of the substrate with W = kω,z

and 2w = k2ω,z representing the z component of the wave vectors of the fundamental and

SH light, resepectively, Psurf is the surface nonlinear polarization of the interfacial layer,

and Pbulk is the bulk nonlinear polarization in medium.

The bulk nonlinear polarization can generally be expressed by a series of multipole terms:

[16] :

Pbulk(2ω) = P(2)(2ω)

Q(2)(2ω) +

M(2)(2ω),

(2)

− ∇ ·

c

2iω ∇ ×

where P(2), Q(2),and M(2) describe the electric-dipole polarization, electric-quadrupole po-

larization and magnetic-dipole polarization respectively. Up to the ﬁrst derivative in P(2)
ef f ,

the three polarization sources are the following:

P(2)(2ω) = χD : E(ω)E(ω) + χP : E(ω)

E(ω),

∇

Q(2)(2ω) = χQ : E(ω)E(ω),

M(2)(2ω) = χM : E(ω)E(ω).

(3)

(4)

(5)

We neglect M and higher-order multipole in our discussion here, because these contributions

are thought to be orders of magnitude smaller than the electric dipolar contribution. The

4

second terms in eq.

(2) and (3) arises from the gradient of the ﬁeld E(ω). Since the

penetration depth in crystals (∼100˚A) is much smaller than the spatial variation of the

ﬁeld (∼10,000˚A for optical frequencies), this bulk contribution is small under nonresonant

conditions. [17]

The surface contribution of the SH ﬁeld arises from two eﬀects. First, at the interface

between the dissimilar media, inversion symmetry is broken for centrosymmetric crystals

and symmetry is changed for noncentrosymmetric crystals, and so a dipolar contribution to

SHG can exist. In addition, there is a discontinuity in the fundamental electric ﬁeld normal

to the surface. This can generate a sizable SH contribution through higher-order multipole

terms. So the surface contribution to the nonlinear polarization can be expressed as:

P (2)
surf (2ω) = χD : E(ω)E(ω) + χD : E(ω)

E(ω)

χQ :

E(ω)E(ω).

∇

−

∇

(6)

Since the tangential components of the incident electric ﬁeld are continuous across the

interface, all terms in eq. (6) involving a gradient that can be neglected when describing an

in-plane surface response and only the ﬁrst term should be considered:

P (2)
surf (2ω) = χD : E(ω)E(ω).

(7)

(8)

If the nonlinear susceptibilities are all deﬁned in terms of the input ﬁeld E(ω), in the

interfacial layer by P(ω) = χ(2) : E(ω)E(ω), then from (2), the corresponding eﬀective

surface nonlinear susceptibility is given by

ef f = χ(2)
χ(2)

surf + χ(2)

bulkLef f F (ω)F (2ω),

where χ(2)

surf and χ(2)
The tensorial properties of χ(2)

bulk are the surface and bulk nonlinear susceptibility tensors, respectively.

ef f can be exploited as: if the SH intensity is recorded as a func-

tion of azimuthal angle of rotation, the variation in intensity reﬂects the overall symmetry

of the surface of interface.

A tensorial expression for the second-order polarization can be written as: [17]

C. Surface or Inrerface Contribution

The surface or interface nonlinear susceptibility χ(2)

surf is a third rank tensor with 27

elements, which reﬂect the symetry of the interface. For SHG the last two indices may

be permuted at will, thus, the nonlinear susceptibility tensor may have a maximum of 18

independent nonvanishing elements( e.g. C1), and higher symmetries lead to a reduction

in the number of independent and nonvanishing tensor elements. Table II summarizes the

results for the form of the surface nonlinear susceptibility tensor χ(2)

surf for various symmetry

classes.

We assume for simplicity that the surface has a simple unreconstructed structure, and

thus for a particular face it has the same symmetry as the bulk. Therefore we use C3v

symmetry for the (111) surface and C4v symmetry for the (100) face [18]. In fact, there exist

many local microscopic structures, even in a nominally single surfaces, and in such cases, the

microscopic symmetry of the structures, such as monoatomic steps, etc. would allow some

speciﬁc tensor element to exist. That is, we may observe a lower symmetry than expected

if the newly introduced tensor is of diﬀerent symmetry. Table III summarizes the results in

cases where surface susceptibility is presented.

From Table III, we see that there are always plural tensor elements which cause the

same rotational symmetry. Therefor, the determination of the relevant tensor elements

must depend on other sources of information, which may be obtained experimentally. Note

that because SHG is described by a third rank tensor, all surface symmetries higher than

C3v yield an isotropic response.

III. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The experimental setup for SHG measurement is shown in Fig. 3. The light source

of the fundamental frequency is a picosecond mode-locked Nd:YAG (yttrium aluminum

garnet) laser (Light Conversion Ltd. EKSPLA 2143A) with light pulses of wavelength

1.06µm, duration time 20 ps, and repetion rate 10 Hz. The linear polarization of the

12

fundamental beam is rotated to the desired angle by the combination of the half wave plate

(λ/2) and the input Glan-Taylor polarizer prism P1. The polarized beam is focused into a

spot of 3 mm diameter on the sample surface at an incident angle of 45◦. In order to avoid

damaging the sample, the pulse energy was set to about 0.5-0.3mJ per pulse throughout the

experiment. The visible-cut ﬁlter F1 situated immediately before the sample surface removes

the visible light component, especailly SH signals which are generated in the preceding

polarizer and lens. The reﬂected fundamental beam and the SH signal from the surfaceare

are collinear beyond the sample surface, and the former is eliminated from the beam by

an IR-cut ﬁlter F2 and an interference ﬁlter F3 (Melles Griot 03FIB008, λ = 550 nm,

FWHM=70 nm). The linear polarization of the SH signal to be measured by the detection

system was selected by rotation of the analyzer P2. The signal was ﬁnally detected by

a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R1464). About 4% of the reﬂected laser beam is directed

through the reference arm containing a crystalline quartz plate. The SH intensity from

quartz plate can be used for providing a reference to remove laser intensity ﬂuctuations.This

signal is detected by another photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928) through an interference

ﬁlter F3. Both electronics signals from the two PMT outputs were fed into a BOXCAR

(SRS 250) averaged over 50 pulses and then recorded using a computer.

The ZnSe(100) and ZnSe(111) crystals grown by the Markov method were commericailly

purchased from Ma Teck Material Technologie & Kristalle GmbH, Germany [23]. Their

surfaces are chemical and mechanically polished. The samples were mounted on a rotation

stage, with the surface normal set parallel to the rotating axis of the stage and could be

rotated freely.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Figure 4(a)-(d), the intensity from ZnSe(100) is shown as a function of the azimuthal

orientation for the four diﬀerent polarization combinations: Pin −
Pout, Sin−

Sout, Sin −
Sout. All experiments were made under the same conditions which makes it possible

Pout, Pin −

to compare the intensities of the diﬀerent combinations. Fig. 4(a) [Fig. 4(b)] displays the

the p- [s-]polarized SH intensity Ipp [Isp] with p-[s-] polarizedincident light, whereas Fig. 4(c)

[Fig. 4(d)] shows the s-polarized SH intensity Ips [Iss] with p-[s-] polarized incident light.

All plots clearly exhibit twofold symmetry. It seems to be consistent with a Cs symmetry. A

more detailed analysis of the experimental reuslts (see below) shows the interference of the

surface Cs symmetry with the underlying C4v symmetry of the ZnSe(100). The data for the

four cases are ﬁt by the trigonometric function square plus a constant, this small constant

can be due to light at other frequencies leaking through the ﬁlters. We might be able to

obtain relative values for the surface and bulk contributions if the function of the incident

angle multiplying the diﬀerent surface and bulk contributions would change signiﬁcantly

with θ (see Eq. (17) and TABLE I ). However, with the experimental conditions used here,

changing from normal to grazing incidence decreases fc and Fc by 5%, whereas fs and Fs

remain small. Hence any attempt to seperate bulk and surface contribution by the use of

this method seams to be inappropriate. It is for this reason that in all experiments a ﬁxed

angle of incidence of 45◦ was used.

For simplicity we concentrate on the s-polarized SHG response for an s-polarized pump

beam, becuase this signal only contains anisotropic terms and will be most sensitive for

the surface symmetry. This conclusion arises because the bulk contribution is forbidden, as

seen in Table III. According to [18], for the (100) face, we see that the surface in general

has C4v symmetry. However, such a mechanism should lead no φ-angle dependence. Even

though we replace the symmetry C4v with lower symmetry C2v, we cannot obtain any φ-angle

dependent signal. Thus we must allow the eﬀective symmetry of the surface to lower from

C2v to Cs, corresponding to the observed symmetry of the rotation angle dependence. From

Table III, for Cs symmetry only the following components of surface or interface nonlinear

susceptibility do not vanish

χxxx, χxyy, and χyxy = χyyx.

And a similar experssion for the Sin −

the agreement with experimental reuslt justiﬁes our choice of Cs symmetry. There is a large

Sout polarization combination, because its absolute SH intensity

In Ref. [24], value of χxxx (cid:30) (χxyy + 2 χyyx) = 1.10 was obtained from the NaCl(100)-air

interface. This diﬀerence is not surprising given the fact that the absorption depth in the

oxide layers of the NaCl(100) is more that of ZnSe(100) in our experiment.

This Cs symmetry may be caused by (1) the interface between oxide absorbate and

sample [7,24], (2) a nonideal cut of the crystal, the domain formation with diﬀerent symmetry

axis [11]. When one only consider the bulk susceptibility, φ dependence for Sin −
is very sensitive to the miscut angle of the crystal axis, even its absolute SH intensity

is very small.

If we consider that the surface tensor elements χxxx, χxyy,and χyxy have

relevance to the miscut angle of ZnSe(100) crystal, which is less than 0.5◦ [23], the response

Sout is determined to be more than an order of magnitude smaller than other

of Sin −
corresponding cases [12,9]. C. Yamada and K. Kimura [8] found it was very diﬃcult to

measure Sin −
condition. However, we observed that the output was about half of the other cases. So we

degree of anisotropy in the SHG signal [25]. The anisotropiy cannot be ascribed to any

particular surface symmetry. One possible explanation may be suggested: the anisotropy

may arise due to variations in oxide layer thickness which could be regarded as generating

a stepped buried ZnSe(100)/oxide layer interface.

15

For three conﬁgurations (Pin −

Pout, Sin −

Pout, Pin −

Sout), the SHG intensity distribution

shows a C4v symmetry if we only consider the bulk susceptibility. Further, we notice that

the oxide layer interface would lower the eﬀective symmetry of the surface from C4v to

C2v. In Fig 4.(a)-(c), we observe twofold symmetries not fourfold for three conﬁgurations,

which is the result of interference of bulk SHG with surface SHG. Threfore, the observed

rotation-angle dependence can be described as

Is.p ∝ |

A + B cos(2φ) + C sin(2φ)

2 ,
|

(26)

where A represents the isotropic surface contribution, B is the bulk dipole term and C the

surface anisotropic term. We least-square ﬁtted the observed rotation-angle dependence for

three conﬁgurations by Eq. (26) with A, B and C used as adjustable parameters. These

ﬁtting parameters are summarized in Table IV for the SHG data. As shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c),

the ﬁt was satisfactory.

In the Pin −

Pout combination (Fig 5.), the peak at φ = 135◦ is higher than that at
φ = 45◦, and the peak at φ = 315◦ is higher than that at φ = 225◦. These diﬀrences arise

from the interference between the isotropic surface SHG and the bulk SHG. The signs of

the nonlinear susceptibility components for the exciting electric ﬁelds in the (011) and (011)

planes are opposite. This is because the bulk Zn-Se-Zn-Se- chain along the [011] has Zn

atoms higher than Se atoms and Zn-Se-Zn-Se- chain alone [011] has Se atoms higher than

Zn atoms. This phase diﬀerence of 180◦ between the electronic wave functions of the two

bulk chains leads to the diﬀrence in the interference between the bulk and surface SHG and

to the change of the SHG peak intensities.

V. SUMMARY

We have developed a phenonmenological model and performed experiments to determine

the symmetry of the noncentrosymmetric semiconductor crystal ZnSe(100) covered with an

oxide layer. Under the four combinations of fundamental and harmonic linear polarization

states considered, the harmnic intensity can be experessed as a function of the light polar-

ization and as a function of the azimuthal angle. Using the caclulated sensitivity to rotation

angle of the SHG signal from the bulk and surfaces, we have been able to deduce the sym-

metry of the noncentrosymmetric crystal surfaces. We found that the measurement using

Sout is particularly useful in determining the symmetry of the oxdized layer interface,

Sin −
which would lower the eﬀective symmetry of the surface from C4v to C2v. The separation be-

tween bulk and interface or surface SHG demonstrated here is promising for the application

of this technique to the study of surface and interfacial properties. This way can be used to

detect the quality of the substrate surface for growth of II-VI epilayers on ZnSe layers.

In addition, we have shown that the [011] and [011] directions can be distinguished

through the analysis of p-incident and p-output confugration.

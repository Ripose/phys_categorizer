Numerical calculations of light propagation in random media demand the multiply scattered
Stokes intensities to be written in a common ﬁxed reference. A particularly useful way to perform
automatically these basis transformations is to write the scattered intensities in the Chandrasekhar-
Sekera representation. This representation produce side eﬀects so that numerical tests are necessary
to deal with the limiting situations of the small-particle (Rayleigh) and for/backwards scattering.
Here a new set of basis functions is presented to describe the scattering of light by spherical par-
ticles (Mie scattering) in the Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation. These basis functions can be
implemented in a new algorithm to calculate the Mie scattering amplitudes, which leads straight-
forwardly to all the scattering quantities. In contrast to the traditional implementation, this set
of basis functions implies to natural numerical convergence to the above mentioned limiting cases,
which are thoroughly discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by
a spherical (homogeneous, isotropic and optically linear
material) particle of arbitrary size is known as Mie scat-
tering [1, 2, 3, 4]. The numerical calculation of this scat-
tering is relevant to several ﬁelds [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] such as
remote sensing (meteorological optics, radar detection of
raindrops, lidar detection of clouds etc.), optical particle
characterization (inverse problems) etc. More recently,
magnetic Mie scattering has attracted the attention of
researchers [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

In optical dense media, the light scattered by a particle
is sucessively rescattered and the electromagnetic wave
phase coherence may not be totally destroyed by the par-
ticle conﬁguration averages producing interesting eﬀects
due to phase correlation [16]. The role of numerical mul-
tiple scattering description is twofold: it can be viewed as
a tool in the comprehension of more fundamental aspects
(memory of incident polarization state [17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
weak localization [22, 23, 24]) or as a tool for random
media characterization (light scattering by biological tis-
sues [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35], for in-
stance). These procedures demand considerable numer-
ical eﬀorts and it is desirable to have very eﬃcient and
robust (covering a wide range of values in the parameter
space) codes to perform such tasks.

To deal with numerical multiple scattering simulation,
basis transformations must be performed to represent the

∗Electronic address: asmartinez@ﬀclrp.usp.br

local scattered Stokes intensities into a common ﬁxed ba-
sis, the laboratory basis. For instance, this procedure is
successively repeated in multiple scattering of light in
a Monte Carlo scheme. Other than being cumbersome,
these basis transformations may increase the propagation
of round-oﬀ errors in the numerical simulations and may
ask for complementary tests in limiting situations.

These basis transformations may be implicitly con-
sidered writing all the wavevectors in the same labora-
tory basis. This is the Chandrasekhar-Sekera represen-
tation, which has been employed either in a radiative
transfer equation calculation [36] as well as in a Monte
Carlo scheme [37]. The drawback of this representa-
tion (not stressed in the literature) is the introduction
of new diﬃculties to numerical calculation, notably the
non-commutation of the two limiting cases: i) small par-
ticle size compared to the wavelength (important to poly-
dispersion calculations), and ii) for/backward scattering
events (important to variance reduction in a Monte Carlo
schemes and radar/lidar detection).

In this paper the problem of limits non-commutability
is pointed out and a new set of basis functions for Mie
scattering calculation is proposed to the implementation
of an algorithm. This algorithm naturally includes the
small particle size and for/backward scattering. The pre-
sentation is divided as follows. In Section II, a brief re-
view of Mie scattering in the scattering plane represen-
tation is presented to set up the notation. Also, an orig-
inal expansion of the scattering amplitudes up to fourth-
order on the cosine of the scattering angle is calculated.
In Section III, the Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation
is reviewed.
It is pointed out in Section IV the non-
commutability of the limiting cases. In Section V, a new
basis functions are presented to calculate Mie scattering

Let us consider a non-absorbing medium with (real)
), a sphere of radius a and
refractive index nm (nm ∈ ℜ
C) to take emission
(complex) refractive index ns (ns ∈
or absorption into account. The origin of the labora-
tory frame (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz) is placed at the center of a spher-
ical particle. An incident monochromatic (plane) wave,
with electric ﬁeld ~E0 and wavelength λ (consequently the
wavenumber k = 2π/λ), propagates along the z-direction
with wavevector ~k0 = kˆz and it is scattered by the sphere.
The interest is on the spherical scattered ﬁeld ~E1 along
the ~k direction, deﬁned by the spherical angles θ and φ
according to the laboratory frame. The scattering plane
is formed by the vectors ~k0 and ~k. Notice that the scatter-
ing plane cannot be univocally deﬁned for back/forward
scattering cases and that the magnetic ﬁeld (of the elec-
tromagnetic wave) is not neglected, but it can always be
obtained from the electric ﬁelds (because of the consid-
eration of transverse wave).

A. Scattering Plane Representation

≪

In a distance R from the center of the sphere, with
(ka)2/kR
1 (far-ﬁeld approximation), the scattered
ﬁeld is nearly transverse. The electric ﬁeld lies on the
plane orthogonal to ˆk formed by the orthogonal directions
ˆθ and ˆφ, which form the spherical basis. Using ı = √
1
for the imaginary part, the scattered ﬁeld in the spherical
basis is written as:

The rotation matrix projects the incident electric ﬁeld

pendicular directions relative to the scattering plane.
The scattering matrix then alters the ﬁeld values via
Sk(µ) and S⊥(µ), which are the parallel and perpen-
dicular scattering amplitudes (relative to the scattering

tions in n in Eqs.
(3) and (4) must be performed to
nmax = ka + 4√ka + 2 [38, 39].

The Mie scattering is dependent only on three quan-
tities: the size parameter ka, (complex) relative refrac-
tive index m = ns/nm (m
C) and ˜m = m/˜µ, where
∈
˜µ = µs/µm is the relative (sphere/medium) complex
magnetic permeability [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The nu-
merical calculation of this scattering event consists of two
parts: one involving characteristics of the scatterer (Mie
coeﬃcients, which leads to several cross-sections) and the
other involving the geometrical aspects (scattering am-
plitudes, which leads to the phase function).

The calculation of Mie coeﬃcients an and bn depend on
ka, m and ˜m through the calculation of spherical Bessel,
Neuman, and Hankel functions and their ﬁrst derivatives
with respect to the argument (ka and mka). The diﬃ-
culty in this calculation is that the recurrence relation-
ships for complex arguments of the Bessel functions are
not stable. This problem is solved writing the spherical
functions in the ratio form [40] for Mie coeﬃcients and
with the use of the continued fraction method developed
by Lentz [41].

If a desired precision in the results is known in ad-
vance, it is possible to use the recurrences for an and
bn developed by Bohren [42] and implement the scheme
proposed by Cachorro [43]. Further improvements to this
calculation have been compiled and studied in detail in
Ref. [44].

The second part of the calculation concerns the scat-
tered ﬁeld.
It depends on the relative position of the
detector with respect to the scatterer and source and
also on the distance between scatterer and detector. The
scattering amplitudes, which depend on the azimuthal
angles, cosine of the scattering angle µ and on the Mie
coeﬃcients, can be eﬃciently calculated using the algo-
rithm created by Wiscombe [39].

Observe that the total scattering cross section is ob-
tained throught the optical theorem, which is obtained
expanding the scattering amplitudes up to second order
on the scattering angle.

B. Scattering Amplitudes Expansion along the
For/Backward Direction

The expansions of the scattering amplitudes are pre-
sented up to the fourth-order on the scattering angle.

These expansions have been explicitly included since they
are not easily found in the current literature. As shown in
Ref. [2, p. 73], the Legendre polynomials can be written
as:

so that: P (1)

τn(cos θ) = cos θπn(cos θ)

to another, the electric ﬁeld needs to be written in lo-
cal basis (ˆθ, ˆφ, ˆk), which depends on the position of the
scatterer. For instance, to write the scattered ﬁeld along
a scattering sequence in a Monte Carlo scheme, the az-
imuthal and scattering angles and all the distances along
the sequence need to be recorded to perform the right ba-
sis transformation back to the laboratory (ﬁxed) frame.
This bookkeeping is necessary when the reversed scat-
tering sequences must be obtained. This representation
becomes specially cumbersome for the calculation of the
coherent backscattering enhancement (weak localization
of light) [11, 12, 13, 14, 37].

The diﬃculties presented above can be solved using the
Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation [45, 46]. Consider
for example the κth scattering event in a given scatter-
ing sequence. As previously, an incident monochromatic
(plane) wave with wavevector ~kκ is considered and one is
interested in the scattered ﬁeld along the direction ~kκ+1.
Note that in this case the incident direction is arbitrary,
not necessarily along the ˆz-direction, as in the scatter-

ing plane representation. In a distance Rκ+1 from the
center of the sphere, with (ka)2/kRκ+1 ≪
1 (far-ﬁeld
approximation), the scattered ﬁeld is nearly transverse
and the electric ﬁeld lies on the plane formed by the
spherical basis vectors ˆΘκ+1 and ˆΦκ+1. The spherical
basis ( ˆΘκ, ˆΦκ, ˆkκ) is deﬁned by the angle Θκ, which is
obtained from the projection of the wavevector ~kκ along
the ˆz-direction (cos Θκ = ˆkκ ·
ˆz) and by the azimuthal
angle Φκ, which is counted from ˆx to the projection of
~kκ onto xy

plane, relative to the laboratory frame.

Equivalently to the scattering plane representation,
one can write the scattered electric ﬁeld ~Eκ+1 along the
directions ( ˆΘκ+1, ˆΦκ+1) as a function of the incident ﬁeld
~Eκ along the directions ( ˆΘκ, ˆΦκ):

cause of the basis transformations, the Jones matrix in
the Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation Eq. (20) can-
not simply be written as product of a scattering by a rota-
tion matrix as in the scattering plane representation (Eq.
2). Nevertheless, writing ˆkκ = ˆz, ˆΘκ = ˆx, and ˆΦκ = ˆy,
then Φκ = 0, and Θκ = π/2 for the incident direction and

and µκ+1 = cos θ, the scattering plane representation can
be obtained as a particular case.

Although the Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation is
more complex than the scattering plane representation, it
is suitable for numerical calculation in the multiple scat-
tering context since it already includes the basis trans-
formation in itself. In this representation, given ˆkκ and
ˆkκ+1 in the laboratory frame, the electric ﬁeld along the

In brief the new algorithm works as follows. Given
the size parameter ka, the relative refraction index m
and ˜m (for magnetic scattering), one calculates the Mie
coeﬃcients an and bn and store the terms (2n + 1)(an ±
bn)/[2n(n + 1)] (Eq. (37)) in arrays [39]. Given the input
ˆkκ and output ˆkκ+1 directions, proceed as follows:

tions are found in Ref. [47] and an implementation for
large size parameters is found in Ref. [48]. In this case,

(l, r), (r, l) and (r, r), respectively;

the sphere along ˆkκ+1, the scattered electric ﬁeld is
given by Eq. (19).

The calculations are performed on the ﬁeld level. To
obtain the Stokes intensities (I, Q, U and V ) use the
coherence matrix ~E†
~Eκ+1 [37].
For a ﬁxed particle size (monodispersions), the func-
tions χ(±)
n (µ) are calculated each time the angles of
source and detection are modiﬁed, or when a new scat-
tering event occurs in a Monte Carlo sequence. In this
case, it is suitable to tabulate X±(µ) (Eq. 37), in un-
µ
even partitions. Higher resolution are required for

VI. CONCLUSION

The Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation is more ap-
propiate than the scattering plane representation to be
considered when multiple M ie scattering of light is taken
into account. Nevertheless care must be taken when this
representation is used because of the non-commutability
of the limiting cases of: Rayleigh and for/backwards scat-
tering. It must be corrected considering the higher-order
terms in the scattering angle in the scattering amplitude
expansions. A new set of basis functions for the calcu-
lation of the angular functions in the Mie scattering in
the Chandrasekhar-Sekera representation has been pre-
sented. An eﬀective algorithm has been implemented us-
ing new basis functions, which have been introduced.

n and χ(2)

Furthermore, the use of a generalization (to associated
Legendre polynomials) of χ(1)
n can be used for
non-spherical scattering, such as in the extended bound-
ary condition presented in Ref. [49]. This generalization,
among the generalization for the spherical Henkel func-
tions, permits the writing of the scattering amplitudes
of non-spherical particles in terms of matrixes, which are
suitable for numerical calculations. These calculations
will be reported in future.

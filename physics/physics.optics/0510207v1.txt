A new tehnique of nonlinear magneto-optial rotation with amplitude modulated light is devel-

oped. The tehnique is an alternative to its ounterpart with frequeny modulated light and an

be applied to sensitive measurements of magneti (cid:28)elds ranging from mirogauss to the Earth-(cid:28)eld

level. The rotation signals exhibit nontrivial features like narrowed non-Lorentzian lineshapes and

multi-omponent resonanes.

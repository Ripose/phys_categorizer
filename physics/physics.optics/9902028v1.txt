Abstract

Based on the system-reservoir description we propose a simple solvable microscopic

model for a nonequilibrium bath. This captures the essential features of a nonsta-

tionary quantum Markov process. We establish an appropriate generalization of the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation pertaining to this process and explore the essential

modiﬁcations of the Bloch equations to reveal the nonexponential decay of the Bloch

vector components and transient spectral broadening in resonance ﬂuorescence. We

discuss a simple experimental scheme to verify the theoretical results.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of most of the quantum optical phenomena are based on two fundamental processes;

the coherent interaction between the system (atom/molecule) and the ﬁeld mode (classical/quantum)

and the incoherent dissipation of the system. The latter is traditionally modeled in terms of the

wellknown system-reservoir theory within the appropriate ﬁnite temperature quantum statistical

scheme [1–5]. Besides thermal reservoirs, the non-thermal reservoirs [4,5] have also been found to be

important in connection with the development of correlated emission lasers [4] and squeezed light

ﬁelds [5]. The essential underlying assumption about the bath, be it thermal or nonthermal, is

that it is considered to be in a state of equilibrium throughout the process. Very recently a solvable

microscopic model for a nonequilibrium bath has been proposed [6] to explore classically, the inﬂuence

of an initial nonequilibrium excitation in a complex system on the relaxation of a speciﬁc quantity

of interest.

In the present paper we extend this treatment to a quantum optical context. Since

the initial excitation creates a nonequilibrium energy density ﬂuctuation distribution which imparts

nonstationarity of the bath, it is expected that optical Bloch equations which take into account of

both the coherent interaction and the relaxation processes within a simpliﬁed description of a two-

level scheme, are likely to be modiﬁed by the nonstationarity of the bath [6,7]. Based on a quantum

version of the model we study this essential modiﬁcation of the optical Bloch equations and explore

some of the relevant consequences.

We thus consider a two-level system in contact with a bath which is not in a thermal Boltzmann

distribution. This nonequilibrium bath is eﬀectively realized in terms of a semi-inﬁnite dimensional

broad-band reservoir which is subsequently kept in contact with a standard thermal bath which allows

the nonthermal bath to relax with a characteristic time scale. The important separation of the time

scales of ﬂuctuations of the nonequilibrium and the thermal bath is that [6] the former remains

eﬀectively stationary on the fast correlation of the thermal noise. The model captures the essential

2

features of a nonstationary quantum Markov process. The physical situation that has been addressed

is the following. At t = 0 the excitation is switched on and the intermediate bath is thrown into a

nonstationary state. We then follow the coherent dynamics of a classical laser-driven near-resonant

two-level system interrupted by incoherent emissive processes due to nonequilibrium intermediate

modes after t > 0 to observe the inﬂuence of relaxation of these modes on the transient characteristics

of the system. We show that the decay of the Bloch vector components is nonexponential in character

so long as the nonstationarity persists. In addition, the nonstationarity of the bath results in time-

dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient which manifests itself in the transient resonance ﬂuorescence

spectra of the two-level system. The underlying physical mechanism of the transient characteristics

can be understood with the help of a generalized nonequilibrium ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation

pertaining to this nonstationary quantum Markov process.

In the long time limit one, however,

recovers the standard Bloch equations and the spectral features.

The outline of the paper is as follows : In Sec.II we discuss the model for nonequilibrium bath and

the generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation corresponding to the nonstationary process.

The application of the model to explore the modiﬁcation of the optical Bloch equations and the

transient spectral characteristics of resonance ﬂuorescence have been carried out in Sec.III. In Sec.IV

we propose a simple experimental scheme to verify the theoretical results on nonexponential decay

and transient broadening eﬀect. The paper is concluded with a summary of the main results.

II. RELAXATION OF A TWO-LEVEL ATOM IN PRESENCE OF A NONSTATIONARY

To start with we consider a model two-level atom (the system) coupled to a set of relaxing

modes considered as a semi-inﬁnite dimensional system which eﬀectively constitutes a nonequilibrium

reservoir. This, in turn, is in contact with a thermally equilibrated reservoir. Both the reservoirs are

composed of two sets of harmonic oscillators characterized by the frequency sets {ωj} and {Ωj} for

the equilibrium and nonequilibrium bath, respectively. The total Hamiltonian is given by

The Hamiltonian is essentially a simpler quantum version of the model used in [6] with two-level atom

as the system. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side describes the system mode with characteristic

frequency ω0. The second and the third terms represent the thermal and the nonequilibrium linear

modes. The next two terms represent the coupling of the nonequilibrium bath with the system mode

and the thermal bath where the coupling constants are gµ and αjµ, respectively. In writing down the

Hamiltonian we have made use of the rotating wave approximation.

The Heisenberg equations of motion for the system and the reservoir operators are given by

the last term in Eq.(7) can be identiﬁed as a relaxation term in the usual way [1] with the damping

µν = π ανµ(Ων) ανν(Ων) D(Ων) ,

where D(Ων) represents the density of states of the equilibrium modes evaluated at Ων. Thus one

where the reservoir average of fµ(t) is zero, i.e.,

hfµ(t)iB = 0 .

Here by average hO(t)iB of an operator O(t) we mean

hO(t)iB = T r{O(t)ρB} , where ρB = Πj exp{(−¯hωjb†

.

ρB is the thermal operator for initial density matrix for the thermal bath ( initial density for the

thermal bath {bj}, nonequilibrium bath {cµ} and the system are assumed to be factorizable ).

We now make the following approximations. The cross-terms which involve rapidly evolving

imaginary exponentials in the summation among the bath modes in Eq.(9) are neglected with respect

to the diagonals, slowly evolving terms. This secular approximation is the usual one made in the

context of master equations for baths [1]. It is wellknown [1] that this approximation is valid in the

limit of weak coupling ( |αµν| ≪ |Ων| ) and of a ‘ﬂat’ bath spectrum for which |αµν| ≈ |αµ′ν′|.

Taking into consideration of the above approximations the Langevin equation for the relaxing

modes, Eq.(9), can be written in the following form,

˙cµ(t) = −iΩµcµ(t) − igµσ−(t) − γc

µµcµ(t) + fµ(t) .

(12)

To explore the inﬂuence of an initial excitation of the intermediate reservoir and its relaxation,

we now consider the evolution of these linear modes cµ in terms of Eq.(12), which allows a formal

solution of the following form [6]

cµ(t) = cs

information of relaxation of the cµ modes due to their coupling to the thermal bath and is in the

form of a typical ”memory-type term” [see the discussion later]. The latter is not to be confused

with the usual memory term ( or kernel ) commonly arising out of the frequency dependence of

friction. The third term on the other hand represents the eﬀect of coupling of the system mode to

Eq.(24) and h ˜ξ(t)i = 0 summarizes the essential properties of the stochastic processes due to

intermediate oscillator bath modes {cµ}. It is important to emphasize that the exponential term in

8

Eq.(24) [exp{−2γ(t − t0)}] does not contain time-diﬀerence of the two diﬀerent instants t and t′ over

which the stochastic process is correlated. Thus this exponential term is not to be confused with

exp{−2γ(t − t′)} which normally appears as a typical memory term in correlation function as

hξ(t)ξ(t′)i = Constant × exp[−2γ(t − t′)]

in a non-Markovian stochastic process. The time-diﬀerence of the two instants t and t′ in the present

study appear as an argument of a delta function [δ(t−t′)] in Eq.(24) due to the use of standard broad-

band reservoirs. t in the exponential function in Eq.(24) is rather a slow time variable, which makes

the stochastic process due to {cµ}-modes nonstationary. In other words the correlation function in

Eq.(24) is not invariant under time translation. We are thus concerned here with a nonstationary

quantum Markov process. This consideration is essential for the application of Onsager’s regression

hypothesis for calculation of spectra with two-time correlation function in the present case as shown

in the next section.

Rewriting Γ¯n(ω0, to) in Eq.(24) in terms of a deviation from its steady state value Γ¯n(ω0) as

Γ¯n(ω0, t0) = D(t0) − Γ¯n(ω0) ,

we identify a time-dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) in the last equation (24) as

D(t) = Γ¯n(ω0) + [D(t0) − Γ¯n(ω0)] e−2γ(t−t0)

.

We thus obtain

Eq.(26) is the desired nonequilibrium quantum generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation re-

lationship. The classical version of the above equation is given in [6]. This relates instantaneous

ﬂuctuations of the nonequilibrium bath (which itself is undergoing relaxation at a rate γ due to its

coupling with the thermal bath ) to the dissipation of the energy of the system mode through Γ.

The nonequilibrium nature of the bath is implicit in the initial preparation which creates an initial

diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t0) and also in the exponentially decaying term.

To check the consistency of the treatment and to allow ourselves a fair comparison with the

classical treatment we now make the following comments.

(i) In the steady state limit one recovers the usual ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for a thermal bath

at equilibrium.

by [¯h = 1]

(ii) Eq.(26) can also be expressed in terms of energy density ﬂuctuations of the nonequilibrium

modes. The energy density which is proportional to the power spectrum centered around ω0 is given

It is important to note that t is the slow time variable which is well separated from the time-scale

of thermal noise. The ﬂuctuations of the noise operator ξ(t) is now explicitly determined by the

nonequilibrium state of the bath modes {cµ} through its energy density u(Ω, t) at each instant of

time.

In other words the instantaneous nonequilibrium energy density distribution of ﬂuctuating

modes is related to the friction coeﬃcient of these modes on the system degree of freedom through

a dynamic equilibrium. The classical version of the above equation can be recovered in the high

temperature limit (¯n(Ω) = 1/[exp(Ω/KT ) − 1] ≃ KT

Our quantum generalization is more relevant to quantum optical situations as discussed in the next

section.

III. MODIFIED BLOCH EQUATIONS AND TRANSIENT RESONANCE

FLUORESCENCE

We have discussed above a simple solvable model for a nonstationary quantum Markov process and

an appropriate generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation pertaining to this process. Two

immediate consequences are evident. The ﬁrst one concerns the modiﬁcation of decay of the Bloch

vector components in presence of relaxation of the intermediate bath modes. We show here that

the decay is nonexponential in nature so long as the nonstationarity persists following the sudden

excitation. The second one centers around the explicit time-dependence of diﬀusion coeﬃcient due to

nonstationarity implied in the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations (26). The transient noise spectrum of

the two-level system is therefore expected to bear this signature of time dependence. With this end

in view we calculate the physical spectrum of the two-level system in contact with the nonequilibrium

bath driven by a near-resonant classical monochromatic light ﬁeld. The Hamiltonian of the coupled

atom-ﬁeld system reads as follows;

H = H0 + ¯h

V σ+ e−iωc(t−t0) + V σ− eiωc(t−t0)
h

i

,

(30)

where H0 is given by Eq.

(1) and V represents the amplitude of the classical pump ﬁeld with

frequency ωc. Proceeding as before, we obtain the Langevin equations for the slowly varying system

operators as;

11

˙S+(t) =

−(Γ − iδ)S+ + 2ξ†(t)Sz − 2iV Sz

˙Sz(t) = −2Γ(Sz + 1

While considering the above equations we emphasize again the separation of time scales γ ≪ Γ.

As a next step, we construct the following Bloch equations for one-time averages from the Langevin

equations (31) [ this requires the calculation of averages like hξ†(t)Szi which include nonstationary

contribution involving Eq.(34) as shown in Appendix-A ],

(37)

The following comments should be made about the Eqs.(35-37) supplemented by Eq.(34) :

(i) The exponential term in Eq.(34) results in an eﬀective transient modiﬁcation of decay rates of all

the Bloch vector components. In the long time limit one, however, recovers the usual decay rates and

the standard Bloch equations. It is also interesting to note that the two polarization components

hS+i and hS−i decay at diﬀerent rates in contrast to the usual case of equilibrium bath.

(ii) The nonstationary contributions in the Bloch equations immediately assert that in absence of

the driving ﬁelds (V = 0) the decay of the polarization components is non-exponential in nature.

This is reminiscent of what has been observed in the relaxation kinetics of classical complex systems

where the inﬂuence of an initial nonequilibrium excitation of others degrees of freedom of a complex

system on the relaxation of a speciﬁc quantity of interest has been explored.

(iii) Although the noise correlation in Eq.(34) involves an exponentially decaying term, δ(t − t′)

makes the noise instantaneously correlated. This implies that we consider here a broad-band reservoir

instead of a colored bath. It is important to note that Lewenstein et.al. [8] in a diﬀerent context

have considered earlier the atomic decay in presence of a colored reservoir. They have used the

modiﬁed Bloch equations in non-Markovian form (which involves exponentially decaying terms due

to the ﬁnite response time of the reservoir) and shown how the eﬀects of the colored reservoir can be

inhibited at large driving ﬁelds. Thus the origin of the exponential term in Eq.(34) is diﬀerent.

We now turn to the second issue, i.e., the calculation of the transient resonance ﬂuorescent spectra.

Using matrix notation, the above three equations (35-37) for single time expectation values can be

put in a compact form as;

du(t)

= M(t) u(t) + f

Since the calculation of spectra rests on the evaluation of two-time correlation functions of the

atomic operators it is essential to examine the validity of quantum regression hypothesis in the

present context. To this end we note the following points.

The essential statistical properties of the intermediate bath modes are contained in Eq.(34). This

equation suggests a diﬀerential behavior in time dependence of the two terms. First, the exponential

time dependence is due to the initial preparation at t0 and subsequent relaxation at any time ( t − t0

) of the intermediate bath modes. So the nonstationary nature is implied in this term. On the other

hand the δ(t − t′) term essentially signiﬁes the correlation of intermediate bath ﬂuctuations, ξ(t), at

times t and t′. The presence of δ(t−t′) ensures the broad band nature and hence the Markov property

of the bath. These statistical considerations, therefore, reveal that the dynamics of the two-level atom

is acted upon by a nonstationary but Markovian stochastic process due to the intermediate oscillators.

By using the Langevin description of Heisenberg equation of motion, Lax [9] has proved that Markov

property implies regression theorem as well the converse. The Markov property is deﬁned by the

requirement that a Langevin force at time t is uncorrelated to any information at earlier time t′.

The regression hypothesis is a consequence of this requirement. Lax has speciﬁcally shown [9] that

Onsager’s original statement for an equilibrium situation is valid even for a nonequilibrium situation

provided the system is Markovian. The validity of regression hypothesis therefore implies that two-

14

time correlation evolves in the same way as one-time expectation value.

The equation for evolution of two-time correlation functions is then given by

of the vector v(t2, τ ) and is given by

(43)

We assume that the atom is initially in its ground state. The Eq.(41) is then solved to calculate the

correlation function (43). The details are given in the Appendix-B.

At this point it must be emphasized that since we are dealing with a nonstationary situation

the standard steady state deﬁnition of spectrum is not adequate to describe the transient spectral

features. We therefore resort to a non-steady state spectrum or the so called ‘physical spectrum’

of the emission from the two-level atoms, where the attention is focused on a dynamic evolution of

the spectrum following an abrupt excitation of the atom and the intermediate oscillator modes. The

main reason for studying the time-dependent spectrum is that the familiar power spectrum which

results from Weiner-Khintchine theorem is not applicable to nonstationary processes. Eberly and

Wodkiewicz [10] have shown that the suitably normalized counting rate of a photo detector can

be used to deﬁne a time-dependent spectrum. This deﬁnition allows the inﬂuence of the spectrum

analyzer ( basically a Fabry-Perot interferometer, for example ) to be exhibited in the spectrum so

that the band limit of the measuring device is appropriately incorporated which makes the spectrum

15

free from ambiguities. It has also been emphasized [10] that when the instrumental width, W , is

narrow enough such that W ≪ Γ the spectrum appears to be qualitatively close to Weiner-Khintchine

spectrum. This transient spectrum has been used previously on several occasions [11]. Following

Eberly and Wodkiewicz [10] we deﬁne the time-dependent spectrum in terms of the time correlation

function v1(t2, τ ) as follows;

S(t, ω, W ) = 2W Re

dt2 e−W (t−t2)

dτ e( W

2 −i∆)τ v1(t2, τ ) .

(44)

Here t is the elapsed time after the system and the intermediate oscillator modes have been subjected

to the initial excitation at t = t0(= 0), W is the full width of the transmission peak of the interfer-

ometer and ∆(= ω − ωc) is the detuning, or frequency oﬀset of the Fabry-Perot line center above

the frequency of the ﬁeld ωc. It is important to note that the time-dependent spectrum is expressed

in terms of the two integrals. The ﬁrst integral is over the correlation time τ and is actually the

counterpart of Weiner-Khintchine spectrum band limited by the width W of the measuring device,

while the second one over t2 takes into account of the nonstationarity which makes the spectrum

t-dependent.

Making use of Eq.(43) in Eq.(44), performing the integration over τ and t2 and extracting the real

part, we obtain numerically the time-dependent spectrum as discussed below.

Since the excitation at t = 0, prepares an initial nonequilibrium energy density of the intermediate

oscillator modes which diﬀers from its equilibrium value, the initial diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(0) deviates

from its stationary long time value D(∞). This deviation is measured in terms of r

[see Eq.(27)] or equivalently in terms of the ratio of the photon numbers n(ω0,t0)

= D(0)

D(∞) − 1

(cid:17)
(cid:16)
n(ω0) . Another quantity of

interest is the rate of relaxation γ of the nonequilibrium intermediate oscillator modes due to their

coupling to the thermal modes. Both r and γ contribute signiﬁcantly to the nonequilibrium version

of ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation [ Eq.(26)] which is essential for understanding the inﬂuence of a

nonequilibrium bath on the transient ﬂuorescence spectrum. In Fig.(1) we plot the physical spectra

16

at three diﬀerent times after the initial excitation at t = 0 for the parameter set r = 0.4, ¯n = 0.1,

Γ = 1.0, γ = 0.1 under resonance condition δ = 0 and instrumental linewidth W = 4.0 for a low value

of ﬁeld strength V = 2.5. The choice of parameter space is guided by the early work of Eberly and

Wodkiewicz [10] on the physical spectra of resonance ﬂuorescence. For a higher value of V (= 10.0)

the expected three-peak Mollow structure appears as shown in Fig.(2) ( all other parameters kept

ﬁxed ). The steady state is clearly achieved around t = 10.0. It is interesting to note that in the

spectra showed in Figs.(1) and (2), the asymptotic condition corresponds to the usual stationary bath

case, presenting the narrowest line. The transient nature of broadening of the bands is due to the

creation of a nonequilibrium bath mode energy density through r. Since r is a measure of the excess

energy gained by the intermediate modes into which the system has to release its energy, the system

also draws some energy from these modes by virtue of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation. The latter

relation illustrates a dynamical balance of inward ﬂow of energy due to ﬂuctuations from the reservoir

into the system and the outward ﬂow of energy from the system to the reservoir due to dissipation

of the system mode. This nonstationary diﬀusion of ﬂuctuations from the intermediate bath modes

into the system leads to transient spectral broadening. This persists so long as the nonstationarity

remains. If the relaxation of these bath modes approaches the time scale of 1

Γ ( with increase of γ )

the broadening eﬀect no longer appears. In the next section we describe an experimental scheme to

show how this can be realized within the purview of a simple cavity QED experiment.

IV. DISCUSSION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL SCHEME AND CONCLUSIONS

Based on a microscopic model for a nonequilibrium bath we have constructed the modiﬁed Bloch

equations which incorporate the eﬀect of nonstationary relaxation and calculated the transient res-

onance ﬂuorescence spectra of a two-level system driven by a near resonant strong classical ﬁeld.

17

We now discuss a speciﬁc system presenting the transient broadening eﬀect studied in this paper.

It is wellknown that the spectrum of the radiation emitted by a strongly driven system is considerably

modiﬁed if the atoms are conﬁned in a cavity. For our purpose the dynamics may be conveniently

described if one considers a two-level Rydberg atom as a system contained in a cavity ( whose modes

serve as the intermediate oscillator modes of the present model ). The cavity in turn is weakly

coupled to the vacuum modes playing the role of the equilibrium reservoir through the cavity losses.

By sudden sweeping of the resonance of the cavity it is possible to dump an appreciable amount of

energy on the cavity modes by changing the number of photons abruptly. ( The tuning of cavity in

studying the emission of strongly driven two-level systems like Ba atoms into the modes of the cavity

had been experimentally carried out both under adiabatic [12] and non-adiabatic [13,14] conditions in

cavity QED experiments [11–13]. ) This corresponds to the initial preparation of the nonstationary

state of the cavity modes by changing r

in such a way that the

= n(ω0,t0)
h

n(ω0) , see Eqs.(26) and (27)
i

energy of these modes becomes suddenly higher than the average energy. Once this nonstationarity

is attained, the eﬀect of relaxation of the cavity modes on the emission of the strongly driven (

externally ) two-level atoms can be monitored by observing the transient ﬂuorescence spectrum.

Since the atom-cavity interaction ( Γ, say ∼ 100 MHz ) is strong compared to the decay rate of the

cavity modes ( γ, say ∼ 20 MHz ), the separation of time scales as required can be conveniently

maintained. We also expect to observe the nonexponential decay of emission of the excited two-level

atom into the modes of an optical cavity so long as the nonstationarity persists.

We now summarize the main conclusions of this study:

(i) The microscopic model proposed here may serve as a simple solvable paradigm for a nonstationary

quantum Markov process.

(ii) We establish an appropriate generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation and its classical

correspondence pertaining to the above-mentioned process.

(iii) The origin of nonstationarity (or nonequilibrium nature of the bath) lies in the creation and

18

subsequent relaxation of an energy density ﬂuctuation distribution function of the intermediate bath

modes following a sudden excitation.

(iv) Keeping in view of the systematic separation of time-scales involved in the overall dynamics we

have shown that the decay of the polarization and population inversion components of the Bloch

vector is non-exponential so long as the nonstationarity persists.

(v) The nonstationarity of the bath results in time dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient which show

up in the transient broadening of the physical spectra of resonance ﬂuorescence.

(vi) We have outlined a simple experimental scheme within a cavity QED setup to verify the aspects

nonexponential decay and transient broadening of emissions from a strongly driven two-level system

in a cavity.

[15].

Since the underlying model of relaxation employed here bears its origin in complex coupled sys-

tems one may also envisage guest-host systems embedded in a lattice ( where the immediate local

neighborhood of the guest comprises intermediate oscillator modes and the lattice plays the role

of a thermal bath ) as typical candidates for experimental realization of such transient ﬂuorescent

processes. We thus expect the model to be relevant in the context of single molecule spectroscopy

APPENDIX A: CALCULATION OF THE AVERAGE hξ†(T )SZ (T )iN R

To calculate hξ†(t)Sz(t)iN R we proceed as follows :

We have from Eq.(36)

ξ†(t) = −i

µ (t) + c†
cs†

µ(t0)e(iΩµ−γ)(t−t0)

e−iωc(t−t0)

This can be written as

ξ†(t) = ξs†(t) + ξ†N (t) ,

(A1)

where, ξs†(t) = −i

µ gµcs†

µ (t)e−iωc(t−t0) represents the stationary ( long time ) ﬂuctuation and

P

gµc†

µ(t0) e(iΩµ−γ)(t−t0) e−iωc(t−t0)

µ

denotes the ﬂuctuations due to the coupling of the system with the relaxing modes. It is essential

to note that because of the relaxation ξ†N (t) noise is nonstationary. It is important to note that the

separation of time scales of ξs†(t) and ξ†N (t). ξs†(t) is much faster compared to ξ†N (t) and represents

a Gaussian white noise. Also ξs†(t) and ξ†N (t) are assumed uncorrelated [6].

hξ†(t) Sz(t)iN R = hξs†(t) Sz(t)iN R + hξ†N (t) Sz(t)iN R .

Since, ξs†(t) is much faster and describes a stationary process, we write

hξs†(t) Sz(t)iN R = hξs†(t)iN R hSz(t)iN R = 0 .

Thus we note

Thus we have

hξ†(t) Sz(t)iN R = hξ†N (t) Sz(t)iN R .

(A2)

20

Because of the exponential term exp[−γ(t − t0)] in the expression of ξ†N (t), expression (A2) describes

a nonstationary average which cannot be equated to zero as shown below.

Making use of the identity

Sz(t) = Sz(t − ∆t) +

dt′

˙Sz(t′)

and the expression for ˙Sz(t), we get

+ ξs†(t′)S−(t′) + ξN †(t′)S−(t′)]

.

We then calculate the average

dt′ [−2Γ{Sz(t′) +

} − iV S+(t′) + iV S−(t′) + ξ(t′)S+(t′) + ξ†(t′)S−(t′)]

dt′ [−2Γ{Sz(t′) +

} − iV S+(t′) + iV S−(t′) + ξs(t′)S+(t′) + ξN (t′)S+(t′)

hξN †(t)Sz(t)iN R =

dt′ hξN †(t)ξN (t′)S+(t′)iN R ,

t

t−∆t

Z

where we make use of the fact that ξs†(t) and ξ†N (t) are uncorrelated [6] and the operator Sz(t′) at

time t′ is not aﬀected by ﬂuctuation at a latter time t. Following Bourret [16,17] and van Kampen

[18] we now make decoupling approximation ( which implies that the correlation of ﬂuctuations ξN (t)

is much short compared to the coarsed-grained time scale over which the average hS+i evolves in

time ) to obtain

hξN †(t)ξN (t′)S+(t′)iN R = hξN †(t)ξN (t′)iN R hS+(t′)iN R .

We then use the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for the ξN (t) [ Eq.(37) ] to obtain

hξN †(t) Sz(t)iN R = Γ ¯n r e−2γt hS+(t)iN R .

(A3)

21

We thus take note in passing that identiﬁcation of a nonstationary part ξ†N (t) (which is not

invariant under time translation) in Eq.(A1) leads us to a non zero average like (A3). The other

nonstationary averages are similarly calculated.

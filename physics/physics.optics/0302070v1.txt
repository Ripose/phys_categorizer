This work is concerned with the propagation of electromagnetic waves in isotropic chiral media
and with the eﬀects produced by a plane boundary between two such media. In analogy with the
phenomena of reﬂection and refraction of plane electromagnetic waves in ordinary dielectrics, the
kinematical and dynamical aspects of these phenomena are studied, such as the intensity of the
various wave components and the change in the polarization of the wave as it crosses the boundary.
As a prerequisite of this, we show that the plane wave solution must be written as a suitable
superposition of the circularly amplitudes on both sides of the interface, we elucidate which is the
appropriate set of conditions that the solution must satisfy at the boundary, and we set down the
minimal, and complete, set of equations that must be solved for the coeﬃcient amplitudes in order
to satisfy the boundary conditions. The equations are solved explicitly for some particular cases
and conﬁgurations (e.g., normal incidence), the salient features of those solutions are analyzed in
some detail, and the general solution to the equations is given as well.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The problems related to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous medium, including those
of reﬂection and refraction at the interface between two media, form a traditional set in classical electrodynamics,
and are discussed in any textbook on the subject [1]. A less familiar one is the problem of the propagation of an
electromagnetic wave in a chiral medium. In such a medium, the dielectric constant has a diﬀerent value depending
on the polarization of the wave, which implies that the two circularly polarized waves propagate with diﬀerent speeds.
A chiral medium, also called “optically active”, can exist for various reasons. For example, a material medium can
become optically active under the inﬂuence of an external ﬁeld, such as a magnetic ﬁeld (the well-known Faraday
eﬀect discussed in many plasma physics textbooks [2]) or a (control) plane electromagnetic wave [3]. Other kind of
media exhibit the phenomenon naturally, such as a gas of chiral molecules [4], or a neutrino gas [5, 6] that contains an
unequal number of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Recently, man-made composite materials have been produced with
similar properties [7].

Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to study the electromagnetic properties of such optically
active media[4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. As we showed in Ref. [17], a particularly simple and general method
consists in parametrizing the induced charge and current in the most general way consistent with general principles,
such as the conservation of the electromagnetic current and, if applicable, the isotropy and homogeneity of the medium.
However, the formalism developed in Ref. [17] concerns a homogeneous medium only. The problems associated
with electromagnetic wave propagation in inhomogeneous chiral media were not considered in our earlier work. An
important example of an inhomogeneous medium is provided by two semi-inﬁnite homogeneous media, separated by
a plane interface. As is well-known, if an electromagnetic wave is incident on this interface, part of it is reﬂected back
into the original medium, and a part is refracted into the other medium. The main object of this paper is to extend
our minimal and general parametrization to treat this kind of problem. In particular, here we study the problem of
reﬂection and refraction at the interface in detail, for the case in which one or both of the semi-inﬁnite media on
either side of the boundary exhibits the chirality property.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we summarize the parametrization of the induced charge and
current for a homogeneous chiral media that was introduced in Ref. [17]. We then extended it to treat inhomogeneous
media, and we consider in particular the system that consists of two semi-inﬁnite homogeneous media separated
by a plane boundary, which is what concerns us in the present work. To set up the stage for the study of wave
propagation across the boundary between two chiral media, in Section III we review brieﬂy the salient features of the
propagation of a plane wave in a homogeneous chiral medium. Then in Section IV we set up the problem of reﬂection
and refraction at the plane interface between two chiral media, in terms of a set of equations that must be solved
for the various coeﬃcient amplitudes that appear in the suitably decomposed plane wave solution of the Maxwell
equations. In Section V we solve those equations to obtain the amplitudes of the reﬂected as well as refracted waves.

The corresponding solutions for various particular cases (including simpler conﬁgurations such as the case of normal
incidence), and some of their features, are analyzed in some detail before the solution for the general case is given.
Section VI contains some concluding remarks and outlook.

II. PARAMETRIZATION OF THE INDUCED SOURCES

Here, and in the rest of the paper we deal exclusively with materials that are isotropic, and we also assume that the
ﬁeld strengths are such that the material responds linearly. We use the Heaviside-Lorentz system of units throughout.

A. Non-dispersive medium

For the sake of orientation, let us consider ﬁrst a non-dispersive medium. Our argument, advocated in Ref. [17],
was to use the Maxwell equations themselves as a guide and write the induced charge and current densities in the
usual form

but the relationship between the electric and magnetic polarization ~P and ~M being more general than the usual one.
For the example we are considering, the relation is

which is consistent with all the general principles stated above. In particular, the isotropy of the medium implies that
the quantities ǫ, µ, ζ are scalars rather than tensors, and the non-dispersive nature of the medium implies those same
quantities are constants independent of the coordinates. As a consequence of the homogeneous pair of the Maxwell
equations,

an equivalent parametrization of the induced charge is furnished by writing

instead of Eq. (2.2). In any case,

A question that arises naturally is whether the expressions for ~P and ~M can both contain two terms, one proportional

to ~E and one to ~B, namely,

Indeed, this has been proposed in the literature[20]. However, the discussion above makes it clear that such a
parametrization is redundant, since the expression for the induced sources would again be given by Eq. (2.6), with

and therefore ζ is the only physically relevant quantity and not ζ1,2 separately.

B. Dispersive but homogeneous medium

While these arguments refer to a non-dispersive medium, similar considerations, and the same conclusions, hold for
a dispersive, but homogeneous medium as well. In a dispersive medium, the relation between ~P , ~M and the ﬁelds is
non-local. Therefore, expressions like ǫ ~E should interpreted in the form

ǫ ~E

ˆǫ ~E

→

≡

Z

d4x′ǫ(x, x′) ~E(x′) ,

and similarly with the other terms involving µ and ζ (in this section, we will use the four-dimensional notation x = (t, ~x)
in the arguments of the functions for compactness.) However, the assumption that the medium is homogeneous implies
~x′ and, furthermore, the causality principle requires
that the functions ǫ, µ, ζ depend only on the relative distance ~x
t′ and not on t and t′ separately. In this case the relations such as those
the time dependence to be on the variable t
in Eq. (2.9) become simple algebraic relations in Fourier space and, as we showed in detail in Ref. [17], the argument
and the parametrization we have used above continue to hold, if every symbol is taken to be the Fourier transform of
the corresponding coordinate space variable, and if we make the identiﬁcation

Thus in Fourier space, the induced sources are parametrized as

and the corresponding expressions in coordinate space are

It should be noted that the last term in Eq. (2.13) can be written in terms of ~B using the relation

which as a consequence of Faraday’s law, as can be seen very simply in Fourier space. In coordinate space, it is proven
by noticing that, for a homogeneous medium as we are considering, we can use manipulations such as

The important implication of this for us is that the question that we posed ourselves in Eq. (2.7) comes to haunt us
again. In the present context, it amounts to asking whether instead of Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) we can write

The issue now is not whether the two parameters ζ and η are redundant and whether one can be absorbed in the
other. They are not redundant; the last two terms in Eq. (2.20) are not proportional to each other in general, and
the second term in Eq. (2.19) is not zero. Thus, ζ and η have a diﬀerent and separate physical meaning, and they
describe diﬀerent physical eﬀects.

The question of which physical systems are described by this parametrization is one that we cannot consider here.
What we can state is that there are no general physical principles that exclude that possibility. Our parametrization
is both general and minimal, subject to the restriction of linearity and isotropy that we have assumed. However, as
we have argued, such systems must necessarily be inhomogeneous. As interesting as the exploration of these systems
would be, further considerations along these lines in a general way is outside our scope.

D. Two homogeneous chiral media with an interface

We ﬁnally get to consider the kind of system that concern us in this work, namely, two semi-inﬁnite homogeneous
media, separated by a plane interface. As we argue below, the proper way to parametrize this kind of system is by
putting η = 0 in Eqs. (2.19) and (2.20). That is, the Maxwell equations are the same as stated in Eqs. (2.16) and
(2.17). The argument is actually subtle, but simple.

Let us take the plane boundary to be the plane deﬁned by z = 0. In the idealized limit of taking the plane boundary

to be inﬁnitesimally thin, then we can represent ˆη in the form

ˆη = ηθ(

z) + η′θ(z) .

−
= 0), the function is zero since we are taking both semi-inﬁnite

(2.21)

However, on either side of the boundary (that is, for z
media to be homogeneous. Therefore, ˆη = 0 everywhere.

The exception to this argument arises if the situation is such that the plane boundary cannot be taken to be
inﬁnitesimally thin, but instead we must take into account the fact that it has some non-zero thickness δ. Certainly,
in the transition from one material to the other, the medium is inhomogeneous and in that region ˆη can be non-zero.
If we look at the physical eﬀects that occur in the bulk of either media at distances, say
δ, then
the eﬀects due to the non-zero value of ˆη in the transition region are of order δ/L. In other words, they are surface
eﬀects. At points that are close to the plane boundary (
δ) such eﬀects could be observable. But deep in the
z
| ∼
|
bulk of either media the eﬀects become negligible as δ/L
0, as it should be since in that case the transition region
→
can be idealized to be inﬁnitesimally thin and then the representation given in Eq. (2.21) is again a valid one.

III. WAVE PROPAGATION IN AN OPTICALLY ACTIVE HOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM

A. Dispersion relation

For illustrative purposes, let us consider a steady-state (monochromatic) electromagnetic wave propagating along

a given direction, which we take to be the z axis. The vector potential is of the form

~A(z, t) = e−iωt~a(z)

(3.1)

where ~a(z) must be chosen such that the vector potential ~A(z, t) satisﬁes the Maxwell equations with the appropriate
boundary conditions. Putting this into Eqs. (2.16) and (2.17), it follows that the wave equation is satisﬁed only for

6
6
the circularly polarized waves whose polarization vectors are deﬁned by

where we denote by ˆux, ˆuy and ˆuz the unit vectors along the x, y and the z directions, respectively. Further, these
polarization states satisfy the dispersion relations

where the refractive index functions n± that appear in Eq. (3.3) are given in terms of the dielectric function (ǫ),
magnetic permeability (µ) and activity (ζ) constants of the medium by[17]

While the index of refraction can in general be complex, even without the ζ term, in this work we consider only
systems for which it is real; i.e., the medium is non-absorbing. This implies, in particular, that ζ is purely imaginary.
This, in turn, has implications on the microscopic properties of the system with respect to the discrete space-time
symmetries, which were considered at length in Ref. [17].

For a plane wave moving in the z-direction that is linearly polarized (i.e., it contains equal admixture of the two

circular polarizations), the vector potential is of the form shown in Eq. (3.1), where

B. Linearly polarized wave

~a(z) = A(eizK+ ˆe+ + eizK− ˆe−) .

In writing Eq. (3.5) we have implicitly chosen the origin and orientation of the coordinate system in such a way that,
at z = 0, the linear polarization vector of the wave points along ˆux, or the x-direction. By simple algebra, and using
Eq. (3.2), ~A(z, t) can be expressed as

~A(z, t) = Ae−iωtei∆(z) 1

(ˆux cos θ(z) + ˆuy sin θ(z)) ,

where

(K+ + K−)z .

Thus, at a given distance z = d, the polarization vector of the wave points at an angle given by θ(d) relative to the
x-axis, the phenomenon known as optical rotation.

However, it should be noted that for a ﬁxed point z, the direction of the polarization vector is ﬁxed and does not

change with time. This contrasts with what happens for a circularly polarized wave, e.g.,

In this case the direction of the electric ﬁeld is given by the vector

~A(z, t) = A+e−iωteizK+ ˆe+ .

where, for simplicity, we have taken A+ to be real, but similar considerations apply otherwise. For a ﬁxed point z,
the polarization vector rotates in a circle, in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

C. Elliptically polarized wave

The obvious generalization of the above special forms is the superposition

~A(z, t) = e−iωt

A+eizK+ ˆe+ + A−eizK− ˆe−

,

which contains an unequal mixture of both circular polarizations. A simple geometric representation of this solution
is given by the following construction. At the point z = 0, the direction of the electric ﬁeld is given by the vector

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

~ǫ(z = 0, t) = (A+ + A−)ˆux cos ωt + (A+ −

A−)ˆuy sin ωt .

That is, the polarization vector rotates in an ellipse, with the axis of the ellipse lying along the x and y directions.
For an arbitrary point z

= 0, we write Eq. (3.10) in the equivalent form

~A(z, t) = e−iωtei∆(z)

A+e−iθ(z)ˆe+ + A−eiθ(z)ˆe−

,

h

where θ(z) and ∆(z) are deﬁned in Eq. (3.7). The direction of the electric ﬁeld is easily obtained from this to be
given by the vector

~ǫ(z, t) = (A+ + A−) cos(ωt

∆(z))ˆux′ + (A+ −

where we have deﬁned

i

−

ux′ = cos θ(z)ˆux + sin θ(z)ˆuy
uy′ =

sin θ(z)ˆux + cos θ(z)ˆuy .

−

Therefore, at a point z = L the polarization is also elliptical, but in contrast to the standard elliptical polarization
phenomena in ordinary media, the ellipse itself has rotated by the angle θ(L). In addition, the polarization angle
acquires a negative phase ∆(L) relative to the x′ axis.

In the next sections, we extend these examples to the case in which the wave crosses the plane interface between
two media, each of which is individually described as we have explained above. The treatment of that problem must
necessarily take into account the kinematical and dynamical aspects of the reﬂection and refraction of the wave at
the plane boundary, among other issues.

IV. REFLECTION AND REFRACTION OF A CIRCULARLY POLARIZED WAVE

A. Kinematics

e−iωtei~k⊥·~x ~A(z) .

We consider an electromagnetic wave incident on a plane boundary as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The homo-

geneity of the space in the xy directions allows us to seek the (plane wave) solutions in the form

For ordinary (non-chiral) media, a suitable ansatz is

~A(z) =

~aeikkz + ~be−ikkz
h

Θ(

z) +

−

~ceik′

Θ(z) .

i
The form chosen in Eq. (4.2) corresponds to the physical situation in which the wave is incident from the left (with
no reﬂection from the far right-hand side, as it should be in a semi-inﬁnite medium), as depicted in Fig. 1.

i

But here we encounter the ﬁrst departure from the standard treatment when we consider chiral media. Namely,
while we can set the incident component to consist of only one of the two polarizations, the reﬂected and the refracted
ones will in general consist of a superposition of the two propagating modes, which in the present case have diﬀerent
wavelengths. For example, if we decompose the refracted wave vector into its perpendicular and parallel components
(relative to the z = 0 plane) ~k′ = (~k⊥, k′
k), then for ﬁxed values of ω and ~k⊥ there is actually a diﬀerent value of
k2
the parallel component for each polarization, given by
⊥, so that the two polarization components travel in
diﬀerent directions.

Together with Eq. (3.3), in this way it is ensured that the functions

satisfy the Maxwell equations in each region.

The fact that the wave vectors have the same transverse component, as indicated in Eq. (4.6), implies the familiar

relationship (Snell’s law) between the angles of incidence and refraction,

and the analogous relation for the reﬂected wave

Thus, for a given value of ω and α, so that the wave vector ~kσ of the incident component is completely speciﬁed,
the wave vectors ~k′′
τ of the reﬂected and refracted components are also completely determined, as well as the
polarization vectors. The only quantities yet to be determined are the amplitudes a′

τ and ~k′

τ , a′′

τ in Eq. (4.3).

From Eqs. (4.16) and (4.17) the familiar eﬀects such as total internal reﬂection can be deduced, in the form that

maximum incident angle ατ max, determined by

above which the refracted wave with polarization τ propagates parallel to the surface (k′
the region II.

τ k = 0) but does not penetrate

In general, the picture that emerges is the following. The incident wave, which has a deﬁnite circular polarization,
is split at the boundary into a reﬂected and refracted wave, each of which is a superposition of the two circular
polarizations. However, the two circularly polarized modes do not travel in the same direction as a consequence of the
fact that their wave vectors have the same transverse component but a diﬀerent longitudinal one. The determination
of the relative admixture of the two polarization modes in the reﬂected and the refracted wave is precisely one of the
dynamical questions that we will address below.

Some of the dynamical issues that we wish to consider involve (i) ﬁnding the amplitudes of the reﬂected and
refracted components of the wave for a given incident amplitude; (ii) determining how the polarization of the wave
changes as it crosses the boundary. In contrast with the kinematical properties that we considered in the previous
section, these dynamical aspects depend on the speciﬁc nature of the boundary conditions at the interface. The latter
are determined by the requirement that the solution given in Eq. (4.3) satisﬁes the Maxwell equations at the interface.

As we have already mentioned, the dispersion relations given in Eq. (3.3) together with the conditions given in Eqs.
(4.15) imply that the function ~A(~x, t) deﬁned in Eq. (4.3) satisﬁes the Maxwell equations in each region separately.
However, we have yet to ensure that the equations are satisﬁed at the boundary between the two regions itself. This
requirement yields further conditions. Are they the same as for the ordinary equations? Or does the ζ activity
constant term modify them in any way? Answering this question is our next hurdle.

To begin, we calculate the electric and magnetic ﬁeld associated with the vector potential given in Eq. (4.3). The

Since the ﬁelds must be ﬁnite everywhere (otherwise the Maxwell equations would be not be satisﬁed), the last term

The remaining relations follow from the Maxwell equations themselves which were given in Eqs. (2.3), (2.4), (2.16)
and (2.17) in the Introduction. The argument to obtain the implied conditions is similar to the one used to arrive at
Eq. (4.23). For example, consider Eq. (2.16). Writing

The ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand side are identically zero since there is no free charge in either region. Thus, the

where we have used the expressions for ~EI , ~EII that follow from Eqs. (4.3), (4.4), (4.5) and (4.22).

The conditions that follow from the remaining Maxwell equations are obtained similarly. In general, by means of Eqs.
(3.3) and the deﬁnition of the corresponding polarization vectors given above, it is ensured that the proposed solution
satisﬁes the equations in each region separately. Thus, when the solution is substituted in the Maxwell equations, only
the terms that arise from the derivatives acting on the Theta function, which are proportional to the delta function,
are not automatically zero. Demanding that they be zero as well yields the required relations. Proceeding in this way
we ﬁnd that Eq. (2.4) yields Eq. (4.23) again, and the remaining two conditions that complement Eqs. (4.23) and
(4.26) are

and the deﬁnition of vσ from Eq. (3.4), as well as the analogous ones for the corresponding primed and doubly-primed
quantities. In addition we have used the fact that, for any wave (incident, refracted and reﬂected), the product of its
wave number times its velocity velocity equals ω, which is the same for all of them.

V. SOLUTION TO THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

A. The independent conditions

Our task is to use the conditions given in Eqs. (4.23), (4.26), (4.27) and (4.28) to obtain, for a given incident
τ , a′′
amplitude aσ, the reﬂected and transmitted amplitudes a′
τ . There are thus a total of four unknown variables to
be solved for. On the other hand, at ﬁrst sight, the number of conditions seems to be six. While Eqs. (4.26) and
(4.27) are scalar equations, the relations in Eqs. (4.23) and (4.28) are vectorial. Being a two-dimensional problem, as
we have seen, each of the vector relations yields two conditions, for a total of six. Therefore, the solution for a′
τ is
algebraically overdetermined, and a non-trivial solution exists only if additional auxiliary conditions are satisﬁed. As
we will see, these are just the Snell-like relations given in Eqs. (4.16) and (4.17), and the dispersion relations of Eq.
(3.3). Put in another way, when Eq. (3.3) as well as Eqs. (4.16) and (4.17) are satisﬁed, two of the six relations implied
τ , a′′
by the set of boundary conditions are redundant, leaving just four independent equations for the four unknowns a′
τ .

τ , a′′

Before going to the details of the problem, it is useful to recollect the corresponding situation in the case of ordinary,
non-chiral media. In that case, for a given value of the transverse component of the wave vector and a given frequency,
the longitudinal component of the wave vector in each of the reﬂected and refracted waves has a unique value. Thus,
the solution written down in Eq. (4.3) indeed collapses to the form given in Eq. (4.2). Nevertheless, the problem
is similar to the one stated above. Namely, for a given incident amplitude ~a, we wish to know what are the the
coeﬃcients ~b and ~c. Being a two-dimensional problem as already argued, then for an arbitrary (but deﬁnite) ~a in the
ˆe1,2 plane, there are four unknowns, represented by the two components of ~b in the ˆe′′
1,2 plane and the two components
of ~c in the ˆe′
1,2 plane. Further, the problem being a linear one (the boundary conditions are linear equations in the
amplitudes), we can proceed to ﬁnd the particular solutions corresponding to the case ~a = ˆe1 and, separately, ~a = ˆe2,
and the general solution for an arbitrary choice of ~a is obtained by linear superposition of those particular ones. This
is actually the procedure followed in Jackson’s book [1]. The fundamental reason why a solution can be obtained at
all, is the fact that there are four independent algebraic relations (that follow from the boundary conditions) among
the four unknowns the we have identiﬁed.

Returning to our problem, these same general principles hold as well. Namely, while some features and details of the
solutions are not applicable or relevant, the linearity property, superposition principle and the fact that the problem
is algebraically well deﬁned, also apply. The fundamental diﬀerence, as far as the algebraic details and manipulations
is concerned, is that in the present case it is not useful to build up the general solution by superposing the particular
solutions obtained for the cases ~a = ˆe1,2, and decomposing the reﬂected and refracted waves in terms of the linear
polarization components. In our case, the circular polarization basis is, as we have shown, the appropriate one to use.

For the remaining vector algebra we use the relations

and

If we now use Snell’s law [Eqs. (4.16) and (4.17)], it is easy to see that the third equation becomes identical to the
ﬁrst, and the fourth identical to the ﬁfth. Thus, we are left with four independent equations which, for easy reference

in what follows, we recollect below:

These equations must be solved for the four unknowns a′

If ζ is zero in both sides of the boundary, so that we are referring to ordinary, non-chiral, media, the equations for
the coeﬃcients simplify. Neither the indices of refraction, nor the angles, depend on the sign of the polarization. In

Regarding the physical interpretation, the formulas in Eq. (5.7) give the solution for the reﬂected and refracted
amplitudes expressed in the linear polarization basis, with the corresponding quantities in the circular polarization
basis being obtained by means of Eq. (5.10). It should be noted further that, whichever basis we use to express the
solution, we have assumed that the incident wave has a deﬁnite circular polarization speciﬁed by σ, which can be
1.
However, we can easily obtain the solutions for an arbitrary polarization of the incident wave by superposition. If the
incident wave is a combination of the two circularly polarized waves, then the solution is generalized to

This solution in fact reproduces the well known results for the situation we are considering. It is reassuring to
conﬁrm, for example, that it embodies the Fresnel formulas when we take the incident wave to be linearly polarized
along ˆux or ˆuy. Let us consider the case in which the incident wave is linearly polarized along the ˆux direction,
which implies that the incident wave is an equal admixture of the two circularly polarized waves, with the coeﬃcients
satisfying

Then the solution for this case, namely

in the linear basis, is immediately recognized as the so-called Transverse Electric solution. Similarly, the solution for
linear polarization along ˆe2,

corresponds to the standard Transverse Magnetic solution. The Fresnel formulas are reproduced by writing the above
results in terms of the magnetic permeability µ and the refractive index n, instead of quantities ǫ and v. These two
sets of quantities are related by Eq. (3.4), which for non-chiral media reads

A particularly simple solution is obtained if, in addition, we assume that the incident wave travels normal to the
plane boundary, α = 0, in which case the other angles are also all equal to 0 by Snell’s law. The above solution then
reduces to

where we have deﬁned

This solution shows various interesting properties. For example, if we consider either σ = + or σ =

, the
transmitted wave has the same circular polarization as the incident one, but the reﬂected wave has the opposite. This
is a well known eﬀect even in the case of ordinary media (ζ′ = 0). The distinguishing feature in the present case is
that the intensity of the reﬂected (and the transmitted) wave depends on what is the polarization of the incident one.
If the incident wave does not have a deﬁnite circular polarization, but it is a linear combination of them, then by

−

superposition the general solution for that case is

Let us consider the case of linear polarization along ˆe1, as in Eq. (5.13). In that case the solution is

Thus neither the reﬂected nor the transmitted waves have a deﬁnite linear polarization (e.g., a′
+ 6
the situation considered in Section V B. Furthermore, while the incident wave is represented by

the transmitted component is

That is, while the incident wave is, at the boundary (z = 0), an equal admixture of the positive and negative
circular polarizations, given by the ˆe1 direction, the transmitted wave is split into an unequal admixture of the two
circular polarizations. As we saw in Section III C, such an admixture describes an elliptically polarized wave, with
the particular characteristics that are due to the chiral nature of the medium, as we explained there. Moreover, in
the region z > 0, the vector that determines the direction of the electric ﬁeld in the present case is obtained from the
formula given in Eq. (3.13), by making the substitutions

Other special cases can be treated similarly, such as the case of incidence from chiral to ordinary media, including
the particular situation of normal incidence. However, we do not proceed any further along those lines, and go directly

These formulas can be written in several alternate forms, in terms of the angle of incidence and the refractive indices,
by using Snell’s law [Eq. (4.16)]. In the appropriate limits, they reduce to the special case formulas already seen.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The electromagnetic properties of a medium that exhibits chirality (also called optical activity), but which is
otherwise linear, homogeneous and isotropic, can be described in terms of the usual two parameters ǫ and µ that
represent the dielectric and permeability functions, and an additional parameter ζ that is indicative of the chirality
property. As we have argued here and in the references cited, such a parameterization in terms of just one additional
function, is both complete and minimal. In the case of an inﬁnite (unbounded) medium, an electromagnetic wave
exhibits the phenomenon known as ‘natural optical activity’, which is due to the fact that the two circularly polarized
states travel with diﬀerent speed if ζ is non-zero.

In this work we have considered in detail various aspects of the propagation of a wave, in a medium that is made of
two semi-inﬁnite media, either or both of which may be chiral, which are separated by a plane interface. Mimicking
the procedure that is applied to the analogous problem involving ordinary dielectrics, our approach was based on
writing the plane wave solution that satisﬁes the Maxwell equations in each region, supplemented by the appropriate
boundary conditions at the interface.

We considered ﬁrst various kinematical aspects of the solution which are independent of the detailed nature of the
boundary conditions. In particular, we obtained the Snell law and the condition for the total internal reﬂection eﬀect,
in the form that it applies to the present situation.

In contrast with the above, the determination of the relative amplitudes of the reﬂected and refracted components
is a dynamical issue that involve the details of the boundary conditions. A signiﬁcant problem that we had to solve
was precisely to elucidate what is the appropriate set of boundary conditions that must be satisﬁed at the interface.
The boundary conditions depend on the Maxwell equations themselves, and since these depend on the parameter ζ,
the boundary conditions necessarily involve that parameter as well.

After ﬁnding the appropriate set of independent conditions, we solved them and obtained the amplitudes in various
particular cases and conﬁgurations, such as one region being chiral and the other one being an ordinary dielectric,
and the case of normal incidence. We considered various features of those solutions, and in particular we obtained in
various cases the corresponding formula for the angle of the direction of polarization.

In the general case, the boundary conditions form a set of four (linear) equations that must be solved for the four
unknown amplitudes in terms of the amplitude of the incident wave. While the explicit form of the solution is not
particularly illuminating, we obtained it and for completeness we wrote it down.

Our work opens the way for handling a whole class of related problems involving chiral media, that we can now
formulate in a concrete way. We can consider, for example, a slab of one material of ﬁnite thickness, inserted between

two semi-inﬁnite media, and in various conﬁgurations depending on which ones are chiral or ordinary dielectrics. Pos-
sible generalizations include also periodic or semi-periodic arrays of alternating materials, and similar arrangements.
From an algebraic point of view, all of them will be ultimately reduced to writing down the plane wave solutions
in each region, and imposing the boundary conditions at each interface. In this work we have shown the way for
treating and solving all such problems systematically. In addition to the interesting and potentially important physical
applications that we have mentioned, some of the ideas exposed here can be useful in other physics problems that
have been studied in the literature [18, 19], which have a similar mathematical structure.

The materials with simultaneously negative dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeabil-
ity also known as left-handed materials (LHMs)[1], are among the most rapid-developing topics
in the modern scientiﬁc community [6, 3, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9] due to their exciting and often unnatural
electromagnetic properties [1, 6, 8]. The “ultimate application” of LHM is the construction of
a lens with “perfect” (subwavelength) optical resolution in the far ﬁeld [2], which – although
potentially leading to a tremendous advance in imaging, fabrication, and communications –
have initiated a lot of controversy [14, 15, 16, 17]. In the present work we show that the LHM-
based lens ceases to be perfect in the presence of even a small absorption and the area of its
subwavelength resolution is usually limited to the proximity of the scatterer, similarly to well-
developed near-ﬁeld optics. We derive the relation between the focal distance and resolution of
the superlens, and resolve the above mentioned controversy.

The fundamental difference between the conventional and LHM-based imaging is clearly
seen when a motion of a wavepacket through the imaging system is considered in the wavevec-
tor space. As a light pulse, represented by a series of different plane waves with the same
vacuum wavelength λ, propagates away from the source, it is subjected to phase and magni-
tude distortions. The former arise from the phase difference between components propagating
in different directions; the latter correspond to an exponential decay of so-called evanescent
components, carrying the information about subwavelength features of the source. Conven-
tional optics is only able to correct the “phase” distortions, while the restoration of (already
lost) evanescent part of the spectrum is beyond its capabilities. The ideal LHM-based lens
represented by a parallel slab of a material with both dielectric permeability and magnetic per-
mittivity equal exactly to −1, can in principle not only compensate for the phase difference, but
also amplify the evanescent ﬁelds, leading to a complete restoration of the image [2].

The materials satisfying the above-mentioned strict requirements on the dielectric permittiv-
ity and magnetic permeability often rely on resonant electromagnetic response [5, 3, 10, 9, 11],
which inevitably implies the presence of signiﬁcant losses. As we show, the presence of losses
in the system dramatically affects its performance as a lens, limiting the “recovery” of evanes-
cent components [12], and consequently introducing the maximal separation between the imag-
ing system and the object f to achieve a speciﬁc resolution ∆. Thus, for case of imaging of a
point slot with a parallel slab of LHM, having ǫ = −1 + iǫ′′, µ = −1 + iµ′′, with electric ﬁeld

where ǫ′′ and µ′′ describe the (small) losses in the lens, and ξ ≈ 0.6 is deﬁned from a relation
sinc(πξ) = 1/2 [18]. Imaging of different objects, using different polarizations, and different
lens geometries[13] yields qualitatively similar limiting expressions.[18] While in the near ﬁeld
LHM-based lens may outperform its “phase” analog (see Fig.1), the logarithmic dependence of
f on losses suggests that it is practically impossible to fabricate the long-awaited “super-lens”
with deep-subwavelength resolution and large (as compared to wavelength) focus distance.

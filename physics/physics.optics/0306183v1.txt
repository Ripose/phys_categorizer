Abstract

We introduce fractional Brownian motion processes (fBm) as an alternative model

for the turbulent index of refraction. These processes allow to reconstruct most

of the refractive index properties, but they are not diﬀerentiable. We overcome

the apparent impossibility of their use within the Ray Optics approximation in-

troducing a Stochastic Calculus. Afterwards, we successfully provide a solution for

the stochastic ray-equation; moreover, its implications in the statistical analysis

of experimental data is discussed.

In particular, we analyze the dependence of

the averaged solution against the characteristic variables of a simple propagation

problem.

I. INTRODUCTION

Diverse experimental techniques have been devoted to the study of the optical properties

of the turbulent atmosphere. Most of these techniques are based on the analysis of the

output of laser beams making their way through it. But also, controlled experiences had

been developed for the laboratory, such as the experiments performed by Consortini et al.1,2,3.

These experiences apply Geometric Optics to interpret the acquired data. This analysis has

its theoretical grounds on the precursor paper by P. Beckman4, who was able to ﬁnd a simple
relationship between the variance of the turbulent refractive index µ(r)—being homogeneous

and isotropic—and the variance of the laser beam wandering over a screen. This derivation,

however, is based upon the strong assumption that the stochastic process is smooth enough

to allow continuity in its derivatives.

This assumption has serious problems when checked against Tatarsk˘ı’s foundational work

about lightwave propagation through turbulent atmosphere5. A short revision of the covari-

ance of the turbulent index of refraction found by him shows that the stochastic process

associated is nowhere diﬀerentiable6.

However, the model introduced by Beckmann is just one of the many used during the

last 40 years to solve imaging problems through the atmosphere, with relative success.

In fact, it is clear that the stochastic properties of the refractive index in Atmospheric

Optics have never been fully understood nor explained. For instance, most works treated it

like a Gaussian process7,8, some others suggested stationary increments, while other works

have proposed the use of non-Gaussian statistics. Ishimaru’s book9 presents an extensive

description of these works.

Simultaneously, over the last decade an intense debate in Fluid Dynamics has been carried

out about whether or not passive scalar ﬁelds, among which is the turbulent refractive

index, behave like the velocity ﬁeld. That is, under which circumstances they inherit the
stochastic properties of the turbulent velocity u(r), which is a Gaussian process that follows

here ζn is called multi-fractal exponent.

It was shown10,11 that passive scalars ﬁelds are nearly gaussian as far as l0 ≪

L0, and are

unsatisfactory modeled either by log-normal distributions, or the so called Frisch’s β-model.

Eﬀectively, in the inertial range, these ﬁelds obey a law resembling the Kolmogorov’s law

for the velocity ﬁelds. Moreover, they do not present the multi-fractal property due to
intermittence whenever an isotropic velocity ﬁeld is present12, i.e. ζn ≡
behavior of the turbulent refractive index predicted by Tatarsk˘ı has been conﬁrmed and

0. Hence, the

extended.

In the meantime, Stolovitzky and Sreenivasan13 successfully obtained Eq. (1) modeling

the turbulent velocity ﬁeld as a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). But this model failed

to replicate the intermittent property. It must be stressed that Kolmogorov reﬁned simi-

larity hypotheses also implies that the velocity ﬁeld is independent of the dissipated energy

probability distribution.

According to what we have pointed out here, the fBm processes seem to be a good al-

ternative model for the turbulent refractive index. First, they are gaussian, and second,

they let us test the Structure Function’s power factor. Also, they are continuos but nowhere

diﬀerentiable, as it results from the application of the Kolmogorov hypotheses to the refrac-

tive index. In few words, the fractional Brownian motion model for the turbulent index of

refraction describes closer the turbulent properties of passive scalar ﬁelds than Beckmann’s

proposed model. However, a mathematical diﬃculty is introduced since we have lost dif-

ferentiability in the usual sense, and as a consequence we cannot appeal to the variational

methods used in Geometric Optics. Our task here will be to show how using Stochastic

Calculus techniques (for a ﬁrst introduction we refer the reader to Øksendal14,15) this sit-

uation can be overridden providing an explicit solution to the ray propagation through air

in turbulent motion. Besides the intrinsic complexity of these tools, our model is meant to

provide a bridge between the stochastic processes and experimental data analysis. Also, we

will gain knowledge about problems handling (geodesic) stochastic equations in Optics.

II. STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN GEOMETRIC OPTICS

As it is well known16,17, the Lagragian inherited from the application of the Fermat’s

Extremal Principle in Geometric Optics is singular. In the Appendix A we show the ray-

equations associated to this Lagragian result to be, Eqs. (A5):

where q(τ ) : R

while the smooth function λ : R3

(cid:19)
R3 is the ray-light trajectory with parameter τ , n is the refractive index,
R can be freely choosen. The election of this function

ﬁxes the parametrization.

→

Since the equations above are nonlinear, we will begin our study by linearizing them.

Moreover, at the same time we will set the parameter τ . Let n be the refractive index of

the medium and n0 its average, we write

n2(q) = n2

0 + αǫ(q),

(2)

ǫ(q) represents a perturbation ﬁeld with its intensity measured by α. We also assume that

it contains all the inhomogeneities of the media, so when α = 0 the index is constant. Now

we express the solution to Eq. (A5) in a power series on α:

q(τ ) = q0 + αq1 + α2q2 +

.

· · ·

Although we can also develop a series for the constraint function λ, it is far more con-

venient to set its value beforehand. Let us rewrite the ﬁrst equation in Eq. (A5) as follows

We can readily ﬁnd the zero-order solution of the ﬁrst equation in (4). The result is the
linear relationship: q0(τ ) = a τ + b. Given that the boundary condition to this problem is

q(0) = 0,

(5)

it implies that b = 0. Now we use the constraint condition to obtain

2 = 1, so we are

a

free to choose the coordinate frame best suited to our purposes. Let this coordinate frame

be:

zˇez := q0 = τ ˇez,

this will be our forward direction of propagation. To solve the remaining equations we need

a bit more than algebra.

The turbulent refractive index measures the separation between the index of refraction

and its average; µ(r) := n(r)

n0. It is a small quantity, that is why its increments are

often replaced in the literature by those of the permitivity. This passive scalar ﬁeld follows

the Kolmogorov reﬁned hypotheses in the inertial range, and so its Structure Function is

ǫ is the permitivity structure constant and H is some positive constant less than one. If the

turbulence is isotropic and homogeneous then the Kolmogorov hypotheses sets H = 1/3; so,

we have introduced the inner scale to correct the departure from this ideal situation. Then,

The ﬁrst order constraint condition reads then

and together with boundary condition (5) makes the component along the z-axis null all

over the ray trajectory. Of course, this condition agrees with the corresponding dynamical

Eq. (4). So we are left with a diﬀerential equation for the perpendicular displacements to

the direction of propagation. Finally, we multiply these displacements by α, and write the

ﬁrst-order equation as

We must provide a context to understand the previous equation. That is, a stochastic

equation is not only determined by the type of process (the fractional Brownian motion in

our case) attached to it, but also by the integro-diﬀerential theory employed to deﬁne its

derivatives. Moreover, there are distinctive stochastic integration methods whether H > 1/2

or H

1/219. Here we are going to make use of the Stochastic Calculus exposed in the

≤

Appendix B, so only the H > 1/2 case will be considered. By doing so, either we are

considering the inertial-diﬀusive range, in the following sense

ζn >

,

or the anisotropic scalar situation ζn →
if an isotropic velocity ﬁeld can not achieved by the experimental setup.

120. This situation could be observed in a laboratory

Because the turbulent refractive index oscillates around its mean value, it is expected

that the light wanders around the z-axis over the screen. So the solution we are looking for

must have expectation zero. This can easily achieved by the formalism we are employing:

the stochastic integrals (formally known as fractional Itˆo integrals) deﬁned by the fractional

white noise and Wick product on fractional Hida spaces have expectation zero. Henceforth,

from deﬁnition (7) we can calculate the gradient of the index of refraction. We have, using

the continuity and diﬀerential properties for the fractional Brownian motion—Eqs. (B10)

and (B12)—in

it has nothing to do with the usual concept of derivative.

Next, the procedure to interpret Eq. (9) requires to replace all the ordinary products

The fractional white noise is a functional on the real line and its composition with another

stochastic process has to be deﬁned. Because any analytic function is expressed by a power

series, as Øksendal et al.14 suggest, we follow our substitution rule for products and replace

7

the powers in the series by Wick’s powers—just as we did with the Wick exponential in

Eq. (B14) from the Appendix B—whenever a stochastic process is an argument for the

given function. The representation for the noise in

B. Ray-light Statistics: An Example

In this section we will use the stochastic ray-equation solution to study the statistical

properties of the turbulent refractive index. Both coordinates of displacement are indepen-

dent, and they also hold the same (non-coupled) diﬀerential equation. There is enough to

consider the 1-dimensional then. The parameter election, Eq. (A6), we have used in our

treatment, also deﬁnes the meaning of the transversal velocities, for they are the angles of

deviation. Being the velocities continuous we can set,

˙Q0 := lim
ǫ→0

˙Q(ǫ) = θ

∗
H .

|ǫ=0 ∈ S

12

Since our solution is dependent of the initial refractive angle θ, its behavior at the boundary,

0, must be known. This boundary is just the interface between turbulent and resting

ǫ

→

air. Henceforth, we will also model the initial angle as a fractional Brownian motion,

θ(ǫ) = c

χ[0,ǫ)(s) dBH

s = c BH(ǫ),

R+

Z

the constant c is adimensional and measures the strength of the noise. The length ǫ works

as a kind of correlation distance, as it goes to zero we are examining the properties of the

interface’s short-range correlation.

Besides, any stochastic process can be put in terms of the spans described in the Appendix

B, and these depend on the construction of stochastic integrals by step functions. So,

even if the former model needs to be corrected—maybe the interface introduces long-range

correlations—the next results are useful; since, they are the building blocks for more complex

stochastic processes.

The solution (14) is written using the chaos expansion (19) and the initial conditions:

IV. REMARKS & CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we provided a fractional Brownian motion model for the turbulent index of

refraction; afterwards, we used this model to build a stochastic ray-equation—a stochastic

Volterra equation. For which we have given a (unique) solution. Our analysis just covers

the H > 1/2 case which is meant for non-isotropic or near diﬀusive range turbulence; that

is, the temperature gradients are relevant.

Besides the fact that these Hurst exponents are hardly found in ﬁeld experiences. They

can easily appear within the laboratory.

In particular, the turbulence is assumed per se

nearly isotropic and homogeneous among optics works even in situations where the turbu-

lence is created but not controlled. The example shown here can be used to test these cases.

Also, we pretend to give a glimpse of the H

1/2 problem extrapolating these results.

≤

We observe that the solution (24) strongly depends on the initial conditions; our election

of the initial angle at the example is the natural choice given the behavior of scalar quantities

in turbulence. Under this condition, we apply Eq. (24) to estimate the centroid’s variance

of a laser beam at a distance L—for any legth L less than 106m according to Eq. (21):

Var[Q(L)]

where the correction to this result is of order

(F )

10−5. We must note that this is the

contribution from the Malliavin derivative. That is, the constant term, of order zero, does

O

∼

16

not contribute to the variance. Also, the anisotropy introduced by the termal ﬂux should

be observed in diﬀerent values of c for each axis.

Now, as H +

1/2 the variance of the displacement approaches to C 2

ε l−1/3

0

L3. We notice

→

that this behavior is the same found in Consortini et al.1. But it not comes from the

isotropic Kolmogorov’s law, with the hypotheses made at the introduction it corresponds to

a Brownian motion (H = 1/2). That is, given a gaussian process with Structure Function’s

power as in Eq. (1) the result from Consortini does not follow. We have shown this can only
be achieved on inertial-diﬀusive conditions, for ζn ց
do not apply to gaussian models used in Fluids Dynamics.

1/3; shortly, the Beckman’s hypotheses4

Nevertheless, the approach we have introduced is just the beginning of a long journey,

since we must examine the stochastic ray-equation when H

[1/3, 1/2). By doing so, we will

∈

conﬁrm that the power law for the variance of the displacements is univocally determined

and no discontinuities arise, Eq. (25) is still valid. But, this will require the introduction

of other tools—even new for the Stochastic Analysis—since in this range any smoothness

property of the fBm processes is lost22, and this inquiry will be the topic of future works.

A step further should be considered afterwards. The proposed model for the turbulent

index of refraction, Eq. (7), just approximates the Structure Function. After we give a

solution to the stochastic ray-equation for the whole range of Hurst parameters with this

model, we will start examining other functionals of the fractional Brownian motion, which

reﬁnes our theoretical results against the observed properties.

(cid:18)Z

(cid:19)

The solution to this equation is interpreted as the ray trajectory, which we shall denote

here as q(τ ). The parameter τ has, in principle, no physical meaning. In Optics Treatises

this parameter is usually replaced with one of the trajectory coordinates, which fulﬁlls

dqi/dτ > 0, and is thus called the propagation direction. But the election of this parameter

can not be done at will16, since, for any parameterization chosen, the Optical Lagrangian

(q, ˙q

R3 are the position and velocity respectively) is degenerated.

Its solution is not

∈

univocally determined because23

for any pair (q, ˙q). That is, calculating the momentum,

we can write the Lagrangian as follows,

L(q, ˙q) =

∂L
∂ ˙qi ˙qi =

This is homogeneous in the velocities which allows us to recalculate the momentum and

Now, the degeneracy of the Lagrangian can be worked out in the Hamiltonian framework

using the constraint we have just found. This problem of constrained Hamiltonians is known

as Dirac’s problem in the literature24. The procedure is as follows: ﬁrst, deﬁne the constraint

then, calculate the Hamiltonian H from the original Lagrangian, from Eqs. (A1) and (A2)

To ensure λ is well deﬁned we need to introduce compatibility conditions. Which arise

which is automatically accomplished. There are no secondary constraints derived from the

compatibility conditions so Eqs. (A3) and (A4) completely deﬁne our problem25. Notice

that λ is actually a smooth function on the constrained space that can be freely chosen.

It can also be shown that

Also there is another functional expansion from where this Lebesgue space with measure

through this work. To do so let us deﬁne the Hermite functions28

Abstract

We show numerically for the ﬁrst time that ultra-refractive phenomena do
exist in one-dimensional photonic crystals: we exhibit the main features of
ultra-refraction, that is the enlargement and the splitting of an incident beam.
We give a very simple explanation of these phenomena in terms of the photonic
band structure of these media.

It has recently been shown numerically as well as experimentally that near a band edge,
photonic crystals could behave as if they had an eﬀective permittivity close to zero [1–3].
Such a property induces unexpected behaviors of light usually called ultra-refractive optics.
The main phenomena are the splitting or the enlargment of an incident beam, or a negative
Goos-H¨anschen eﬀect [4]. The common explanation of these facts lie on the study of the
photonic dispersion curves. Though appealing, it seems diﬃcult to turn this explanation into
a rigorous one as the notion of group velocity in a strongly scattering media seems doubtful
apart in the homogenization sense which is not the situation for ultrarefractive optics. In
our opinion, these surprising and beautiful phenomena mainly rely on the rapid change in
the behavior of the ﬁeld inside the structure when crossing a band edge. In this article, we
provide a rather simple explanation of some of these phenomena (splitting and enlargment
of an incident beam), which implies that they should be observed with one dimensional
structures (as foreseen by [1]). Indeed, we show by numerical experiments that it is the case
in Bragg mirors (the simplest photonic crystals).

From a theoretical point of view, we consider a periodic one dimensional medium charac-
terized by its relative permittivity ε (x), which is assumed to be real, illuminated by a plane
wave. It is well known that the band structure is determined by the monodromy matrix
T of one layer [5,6], that is, the matrix linking the ﬁeld and its derivative over one period.
This matrix is a function of λ and θ. The main quantity is then φ (λ, θ) = 1
2tr (T (λ, θ)).
When |φ (λ, θ)| is inferior to 1 then (λ, θ) belong to a conduction band, and when |φ (λ, θ)|

1

is superior to 1 then (λ, θ) belong to a gap. In ﬁg. 1 we give a numerical example for a
Bragg Mirror with ε1 = 1, ε2 = 4, h1 = h2 = 1 (the lengths are given in λ units).

Now let us use a Gaussian beam as the incident ﬁeld. Let us suppose that the mean
angle of the beam is zero (normal incidence) and that its wavelength is very near a band
edge. Then two things may happen. Reasoning on the oriented wavelengths axis, if the
beam is centered on the left side of the gap (the dispersion diagram is given in the plane
(λ, θ), if one uses frequencies instead of wavelengths one has to exchange left and right), the
center of the beam belongs to a conduction band and the edges of the beam belong to the
gap. Consequently, after propagation in the medium, the transmitted ﬁeld has a narrowed
spectral proﬁle, and therefore the beam is spatially enlarged (ﬁgures 1,2). Conservely, if the
beam is centered on the right side of the gap, then the center of the beam belongs to the
gap, and the edges of the beam belong to the conduction band. Therefore, the transmitted
ﬁeld has two well separated peaks and the beam is splitted in two parts (ﬁgures 1,3). The
fundamental remark here is that ultra-refractive phenomena are due to the rapid variation
of the conduction band with respect to the angle of incidence, in complete contradiction with
the habitual requested properties of photonic crystals, which are expected to have a dispersion
diagram quite independent of the angle of incidence.

Let us now check numerically the above explanations. We still use the previous Bragg
Mirror. The numerical experiments are done with an s-polarized incident ﬁeld of the form:

ui (x, y) = Z A (α) exp (iαx − iβ (α) y) dα

In the ﬁrst numerical experiment, we set λ = 2.7 and θ0 = 0◦. We have plotted in ﬁgure
(4a) the transmission coeﬃcient as well as the spectral proﬁle of the transmitted beam.
Obviously, this proﬁle is much narrower than the incident one. The map of the electric ﬁeld
is given in ﬁgure (4b). The incident ﬁeld is coming from below. As expected, we observe a
strong enlargement of the transmitted beam.

For the second numerical experiment, we use λ = 3 and θ0 = 0◦. This time, the center of
the beam belong to the gap. We have plotted in ﬁgure (5a) the transmission coeﬃcient as
well as the spectral proﬁle of the incident and transmitted ﬁelds. It appears that there are
two isolated peaks, and therefore the transmitted ﬁeld is splitted spatially into two parts, as
shown in ﬁgure (5b). At that point it is easily seen that by switching the incident beam it is
possible to keep only one transmitted beam. This is done in the last experiment, where we
set θ0 = 10◦ . As it can been seen on ﬁg 6 (a), only the right part of the beam is signiﬁcantly
transmitted, and thus there is only one transmitted beam (ﬁg. 6 (b)). If Snell-Descartes
law is directly applied to this situation, then it seems that the medium has an optical index
that is inferior to 1.

As a conclusion, we have shown both theoretically and numerically that ultra-refractive
phenomena do happen in one-dimensional Bragg mirrors, or more generally in one dimen-
sional photonic crystals. They may be well explained by means of the intersection of the
support of the incident beam with the gaps and the conduction bands.
It must also be

noted that, though one dimensional photonic crystals exhibit ultra-refractive properties,
bidimensional or three dimensional ones should show a better eﬃciency due their richer
band diagrams. Nevertheless, doping 1-D structure or using quasi-crystals may enable a
fair control over the width of the gaps and conduction bands, thus leading to the design of
practical devices. Finally, it should also be noted that such a surprising phenomenon as a
negative Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect does not seem to be possible in 1D structures.

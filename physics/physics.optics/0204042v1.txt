Abstract

We predict that the combination of space and time modulational instabilities occur-

ing via parametric wave-mixing in quadratic media leads to coloured conical emission.

This phenomenon should be observed under conditions usually employed in second-

harmonic generation experiments.

Modulational instability (MI) stands for the exponential growth of periodic, long-wavelength

perturbations occuring either in time (i.e., temporal break-up [1]), or space (ﬁlamentation,

e.g. Ref. [2]), due to interplay of Kerr nonlinearity and group-velocity dispersion (GVD) or

diﬀraction, respectively. MIs occur also in quadratic media, in the form of parametric in-

stabilities of two-color pump beams, encompassing both the cases of propagation invariant

solutions (i.e., eigenmodes [3, 4]), and periodic pump evolutions [5, 6] as in, e.g. unseeded

second-harmonic generation (SHG). Filamentation has been observed both in unseeded and

seeded SHG geometries, in 1+2 (bulk) and 1+1 (planar waveguides) dimensions [4, 5, 7],

while temporal MI have not been observed yet. On this ground, one might naturally wonder

about the coupling of spatial and temporal degrees of freedom, as occurs, e.g., in self-focusing

of short pulses. In this letter, our purpose is to show that, in the presence of both disper-

sion and diﬀraction, spatio-temporal MI in quadratic bulk samples cannot be simply seen

as the mere superposition of ﬁlamentation and temporal break-up. Rather, it leads to a

new phenomenon, namely coloured conical emission (CCE), where rings of diﬀerent colours

are expected to grow exponentially on top of both pump far-ﬁelds. As we show CCE via

SHG has speciﬁc features which make it diﬀerent from that earlier predicted for Kerr media

[8, 9, 10]. It diﬀers also from other space-time phenomena characteristic of SHG, such as

snake instabilities [11], where the spatial breakup of SHG solitons associated with temporal

2

MI does not lead to substantial modiﬁcations of the beam angular spectra, which remain

conﬁned nearly on-axis.

Although the phenomenon of CCE implies component which travel oﬀ-axis, the angles

usually involved are rather small and it is reasonable to use the following paraxial dimen-

sionless model for SHG in noncritical conﬁguration (i.e., no spatial walk-oﬀ)

Instabilities sets in when at least one of the four eigenvalues λ in Eq. (4) have a positive

real part, thus causing the perturbation to grow exponentially with gain g = g(Ω, K) =

2Re(λ). Two qualitatively diﬀerent regimes are found depending on the sign of GVD. In

Fig. ?? we display the typical spectral gain curve obtained in the anomalous GVD regime

(β1,2 = −1). As shown, the gain is relatively narrowband, and its axisymmetric feature (g

peaks at Ω2 + K 2 = constant) reﬂects the fact that space and time play indeed the same

role. Conversely, when the GVD is normal, perturbations with large wavevector (angle) K

and detuning Ω, can be ampliﬁed. Three diﬀerent branches of growing perturbations exist

even when the collinear process is phase-matched (δk = 0), as shown in Fig. ??(a). This type

of spatio-temporal MI entails CCE, which can be regarded as the ampliﬁcation process of

a superposition of Bessel J0 beams characterized by progressively larger values of of angle-

frequency (K − Ω) pairs. The peak gain [obtained in a wide bandwidth of high frequencies

K − Ω, see Fig. ??(a)], is displayed in Fig. ??(b) and decreases monotonically for large |δk|

for both eigenmodes.

The underlying physics of CCE involve multiple three-photon processes. Pump photons

at 2ω traveling on-axis decay into photon pairs at frequency ω − δω and ω + δω traveling

oﬀ-axis with opposite angles. These in turn can produce oﬀ-axis photons at 2ω ± δω via sum-

frequency mixing with on-axis pump photons at ω. In the limit δk = ±2 where the pump

degenerate into the single component u±

20 = ±1 (u±

10 = 0), only the downconversion process

takes place, and we can write the longitudinal projection (the transverse one is identically

satisﬁed) of the noncollinear phase-matching condition as kz(2ω)−kz(ω+δω)−kz(ω−δω) = 0.

In the paraxial approximation kz(ω ± δω) = [k(ω ± δω)2 − k2

t ]1/2 ≃ k(ω ± δω) − k2

t /2k1 (kt is

the real-world tranverse wavenumber) and by expanding k(ω ± δω) = k1 ± V −1

(5)

In terms of dimensionless frequencies K = ktR0 and Ω = δωT0, Eq. (5) reads as Ω2 − K 2 =

±2, which turns out to be in perfect agreement with the locus (K − Ω) of peak gain as

obtained from Eq. (4).

Remarkably we ﬁnd that CCE is robust against the presence of GVM. In fact for δ 6= 0

CCE occurs also in the ideal GVD-free limit (β1,2 = 0). The relative magnitude of GVM

and GVD depends, however, on the intensity It. For instance, in a LBO crystal pumped at

λ0 = 1 µm (k′′

1 = 0.045 ps2/m, k′′

2 = 0.25 ps2/m) with It = 50 GW/cm2 (Znl = 0.6 mm), we

ﬁnd Zw = 0.12 mm which yields δ = 5.4. Figure ?? shows the diﬀerent gain branches for this

case, when the crystal operates in the large mismatch limit k2−2k1 = −30 cm−1 (δk = −1.8).

The dimensional gain G = g/Znl is reported against real-world angles θ ≃ sin θ = K/(k1R0)

and wavelength detunings ∆λ = λ2

0Ω/(2πcT0).

Though we have considered perturbations growing on top of the SHG eigenmodes, CCE

can occur also from diﬀerent launching conditions entailing exchange of energy between ω

and 2ω pump beams. This case is similar to spatial or temporal MI occuring in unseeded

SHG, and can be analyzed by means of Floquet techniques [5, 6]. In this letter, we rather

present numerical evidence for such phenomenon, by integrating Eqs. (1) in 1+1+1D, setting

∂y = 0. As an example Fig. ?? shows the spectral content of the two ﬁelds after propagation

(z = 15), as obtained when only the pump beam u1 is launched at z = 0, on top of white

noise. As shown, CCE favours the ampliﬁcation of spatio-temporal frequencies which closely

follow the spectral gain [see Fig. ??(a)]. Due to the large bandwidth of the process we have

6

also found that CCE takes place from short pulse, narrow beam excitations, a case which

will be discussed elsewhere.

We end up by emphasizing that CCE in SHG exhibits important diﬀerences with respect

to CCE in true Kerr media. First, SHG makes CCE accessible in materials which are virtually

GVD-free, and, in the large mismatch limit, for both signs of eﬀective Kerr nonlinearity in

the same physical material. However, the major importance of CCE stems from the fact that

it can trigger the formation of novel spatio-temporal propagation-invariant wavepackets of

Eqs. (1), i.e. um(r, t, z) = qm(r, t) exp(imβz) [14]. In the normal GVD regime, qm(r, t) exist

for β < 0 in the form of a polichromatic superposition of J0 beams [12], so-called nonlinear

X-waves [14], which exist also in the linear limit [15]. In SHG when the J0 perturbations

are ampliﬁed at the expense of an out-of-phase pump beam, they develop the right sign

of nonlinear phase-shift (β < 0) for the formation of a nonlinear X-wave. Viceversa, in

Kerr media, where nonlinear X-waves also exist, cw plane-waves and localized wavepackets

experience opposite nonlinear phase-shifts, and such mechanism is unlikely to take place.

In summary we have shown that spatio-temporal MI of propagation-invariant as well as

dynamically evolving pump beams in SHG gives rise to conical emission, which might play

an important role in the space-time dynamics. Such phenomenon is intrinsic to quadratic

materials and should not be confused with other recently reported mechanisms of conical

Abstract. We show that in addition to well known Bessel, Hermite-Gauss,
and Laguerre-Gauss beams of electromagnetic radiation, one may also construct
exponential beams. These beams are characterized by a fall-oﬀ in the transverse
direction described by an exponential function of ρ. Exponential beams, like
Bessel beams, carry deﬁnite angular momentum and are periodic along the
direction of propagation, but unlike Bessel beams they have a ﬁnite energy per unit
beam length. The analysis of these beams is greatly simpliﬁed by an extensive
use of the Riemann-Silberstein vector and the Whittaker representation of the
solutions of the Maxwell equations in terms of just one complex function. The
connection between the Bessel beams and the exponential beams is made explicit
by constructing the exponential beams as wave packets of Bessel beams.

Exponential beams of electromagnetic radiation

1. Introduction

Directed beams are very common forms of electromagnetic radiation, especially in the
optical range. Several mathematical representation of such beams were introduced in
the past. Among various beams, the Bessel beams and the Laguerre-Gauss beams play
a distinguished role because they are characterized by a deﬁnite value of the projection
of the angular momentum on the direction of propagation. Beams carrying angular
momentum were studied theoretically and experimentally (a collection of papers on
the optical angular momentum has been recently published [2]). A presentation of
new examples of such beams seems to be worthwhile. In this paper we produce a new
family of beams — the exponential beams. The exponential beams are exact beam-like
solutions of the Maxwell equations with a deﬁnite value of angular momentum and
with an exponential fall-oﬀ in the transverse direction. They can be placed halfway
between the Bessel beams and the Laguerre-Gauss beams. Similarly to the Bessel
beams, exponential beams have a deﬁnite value of the wave vector in the direction of
propagation and like the Laguerre-Gauss beams they are conﬁned in the transverse
direction. The exponential beams are not monochromatic, but their spectrum may
be highly peaked. They can be conveniently represented as wave packets of Bessel
beams. In our analysis of exponential beams we shall employ the tool developed in
our recent work [3] — the Whittaker representation of the Riemann-Silberstein (RS)
vector — that enables one to derive any solution of the free Maxwell equations from a
complex solution of the scalar wave equation. We begin with a brief summary of this
representation.

2. Whittaker representation of the RS vector

A natural tool in the analysis of the solutions of the Maxwell equations, in both
classical and quantum theories, is a complex vector F ,

F =

(E + icB),

ǫ0
2

r

that carries all the information about the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We named this vector
in [4] the Riemann-Silberstein (RS) vector because it made its ﬁrst appearance in [5]
and was more extensively analyzed in [6]. The RS vector has been occasionally used
in the past [7, 8] in classical electrodynamics, but we believe that its power lies also in
bridging a gap between the classical and the quantum theory of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld [3].

Owing to the linearity and the homogeneity of the Maxwell equations, the
coeﬃcient in the deﬁnition (1) is not important and we shall often disregard the
question of the overall normalization of F and use the RS vector in the form
F = E + icB. Two pairs of Maxwell equations expressed in terms of F reduce
to just one pair

∂tF (r, t) =

ic

F (r, t),

F (r, t) = 0.

−

∇·

Following Whittaker [9, 10], we shall express the solutions of these equations by one
complex function χ(r, t) (in fact, Whittaker used an equivalent representation of the
solutions of real Maxwell equations in terms of two real functions)

3. Exponential beams



We shall construct exponential beams as wave packets of Bessel beams.
In this
manner we can automatically obtain a spectral decomposition of exponential beams,
since every Bessel beam is monochromatic. The Bessel beams are obtained from the
Whittaker representation (3) or (5) by choosing the scalar functions in the form [3]

qz q⊥m(ρ, φ, z, t) = e−iσ(ωqt−qzz−mφ)Jm(q⊥ρ),

z and σ =

where ωq = cq = c
1 determines whether the wave will have the
right-handed or the left-handed polarization. Since Bessel beams form a complete
set of solutions of the Maxwell equations, every solution can be represented as a
superposition of Bessel beams. Owing to the linear dependence of the RS vector on
χ, the construction of such superpositions can be realized by simply superposing the
corresponding functions χ. In order to obtain a wave packet of Bessel beams with
a ﬁxed angular momentum, we must include in this superposition only the Bessel
functions with a given value of m. The general wave packet of this kind (for a ﬁxed
value of σ) is

χmσ(ρ, φ, z, t) = eiσmφ

where h(qz, q⊥) is some weight function. For beam-like solutions, the longitudinal
component qz should not be spread out too much and also it must be much larger
than the transverse component q⊥.

There are very few weight functions that allow for an analytic evaluation of the
integrals over q⊥ and qz in (7).
In addition to those treated in our previous work
[3], there are several weight functions that lead to exponential beams. The simplest
example of a beam with an exponential fall-oﬀ will be obtained by ﬁxing the value
of qz and taking a superposition of Bessel beams with a varying q⊥. We shall only
write down the formulas for σ = 1. The case σ =
1 can be obtained by the complex
conjugation. The expression (7) becomes now

−

χmqz (ρ, φ, z, t) = ei(mφ+qzz)

dq⊥ h(q⊥)e−ic√q2

z +q2

⊥tJm(q⊥ρ).

(8)

Obviously, the beam constructed in this way will not be monochromatic — the weight
function h(q⊥) determines the spectral characteristic of the beam. In order to show
explicitly the distribution of frequencies, we change the integration variable from q⊥
⊥. In addition, for mathematical convenience, we shall replace the
to ω = c
1 + (q⊥/qz)2 and we
frequency ω by a dimensionless parameter w = ω/c

general characteristic of all beams of radiation endowed with angular momentum [3].
For m = 0, we obtain the standard plane wave.

Having at our disposal the expansion (8) of the exponential beam into the Bessel
beams, we may calculate the spatial Fourier representation of the exponential beam.
To this end, we use the expansion of the plane wave into Bessel beams (cf. Eq. 8.511.4
of Ref. [11])

4. Time evolution of exponential beams

Exponential beams are not stationary — they evolve in time. At a given time, our
exponential beams look like diﬀraction-less beams — their energy density and the
Poynting vector do not change along the direction of propagation.
In this respect
they resemble Bessel beams. However, they exhibit a speciﬁc time dependence. In the
transverse directions these beams ﬁrst shrink and then expand. In our formulas the
origin of time is chosen at the moment when the beam is maximally squeezed. This
behavior is illustrated in ﬁgure 2 where we plot the energy density F ∗
F calculated
for the RS vector (18) as a function of ρ and t. In order to describe the time evolution
in quantitative terms we shall use as a measure of the transverse size of the beam the
mean square radius of the energy distribution

5. Conclusions

We have constructed a new class of exact beam-like solutions of the Maxwell equations
with an exponential decrease in the transverse direction. They are characterized by the
wave vector qz and the projection of the angular momentum m on the beam direction.
These beams spread out in time but for a ﬁxed value of t the energy distribution does
not change along the beam direction. The exponential beams are not monochromatic,
but they can be made nearly monochromatic by taking a large value of the parameter
τ .

In addition to the simplest case described before, there are several other examples of
beams with an exponential fall-oﬀ in the transverse direction. They are derived from

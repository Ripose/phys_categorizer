Abstract

We review in this article the inﬂuence of surface waves on the thermally excited
electromagnetic ﬁeld. We study in particular the ﬁeld emitted at subwalength dis-
tances of material surfaces. After reviewing the main properties of surface waves, we
introduce the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem that allows to model the ﬂuctuating
electromagnetic ﬁelds. We then analyse the contribution of these waves in a variety
of phenomena. They give a leading contribution to the density of electromagnetic
states, they produce both temporal coherence and spatial coherence in the near
ﬁeld of planar thermal sources. They can be used to modify radiative properties
of surfaces and to design partially spatially coherent sources. Finally, we discuss
the role of surface waves in the radiative heat transfer and the theory of dispersion
forces at the subwavelength scale.

ǫ + 1

Many condensed matter properties are determined by surface properties. Very
often, surface waves, which are electromagnetic eigenmodes of the surface,
play a key role. Let us mention a few examples. It has been demonstrated [1]
that the lifetime of a molecule varies dramatically when a metallic surface is
brought at a distance smaller than a micron. This eﬀect is due to the resonant
excitation of surface plasmons. The van der Waals force between a molecule
2 where ǫ is the dielectric constant
and an interface is proportional to 1/
|
of the medium. There is therefore a resonance for the particular frequency
such that ǫ =
1. This condition coincides with a branch of the dispersion
relation of a surface wave. It can be viewed as a resonant excitation of surface
charge oscillations. It was shown in [2] that the van der Waals force between a
molecule and a surface can become repulsive depending on the relative position
of the molecule and the surface resonances. Enhanced scattering due to the
resonant excitation of surface charges has also been demonstrated for SiC in
the infrared : a tip brought close to a surface generates a very strong scattering
signal for some particular frequencies corresponding to the excitation of surface
waves [3]. Both experiments can be understood by replacing the interface by an
image whose amplitude is very large owing to the excitation of a resonance of
the surface charges. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) is partially
due to the enhancement of the electromagnetic ﬁeld at the interface due to
the excitation of a surface wave. The resonance of the electromagnetic (EM)
ﬁeld at an interface is also responsible for the enhanced transmission of a
metallic ﬁlm with a periodic array of holes [4,5]. The resonance of the EM
ﬁeld associated with the surface mode is responsible for the so-called ”perfect
lens” eﬀect [6]. A key feature of all the above examples is that they involve
the interaction of a surface and an object in the near ﬁeld of the structure. As
it will be explained in details in Section 2, surface waves are evanescent waves
whose amplitude decreases away from the interface on a wavelength scale. In
the far ﬁeld, the inﬂuence of such modes is therefore negligible. In the near
ﬁeld on the contrary, their role is essential.

We will see in Section 3 that surface waves can be excited by thermal ﬂuc-
tuations inside a body. The role of surface waves in the modiﬁcation of the
density of EM states at the interface has a strong inﬂuence on the thermally
emitted ﬁelds. Their intensity is many orders of magnitude larger in the near
ﬁeld than in the far ﬁeld [7]. In addition, they are quasi monochromatic in
the vicinity of the surface. This entails that their coherence properties are ex-
tremely diﬀerent from those of the blackbody radiation [8]. There have been
recently several experiments that have probed these thermal ﬁelds in the near-
ﬁeld regime : heating of trapped atoms [9], realization of a spatially partially
coherent thermal source [10]. After reviewing these experiments, we will show
how an EM approach with random ﬂuctuating thermal sources can be used

2

to describe and analyse these eﬀects. It is based on the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem. We will see that the knowledge of the electromagnetic energy den-
sity gives acces to a fundamental concept : the local density of EM states. In
section 4, we study the EM coherence properties near a material supporting
surface waves and held at a temperature T . We will see that the emitted ﬁeld
has very peculiar spatial coherent properties in the near ﬁeld. Indeed, the ﬁeld
can be spatially coherent over a length larger than several tens of wavelength.
We then use this property to design coherent thermal sources. In section 5
and 6 we show that the radiative heat transfer is enhanced by several orders
in magnitude in the near ﬁeld when two material supporting surface waves are
put face to face. We will consider three cases : two nanoparticles face to face, a
nanoparticle near a plane interface and two semi-inﬁnite half-spaces separated
by a narrow gap. In the last section, we will analyse the role played by the
surface waves in the Casimir force i.e in the force of interaction between two
semi-inﬁnite bodies. We will see that this force is dominated in the near ﬁeld
by the interaction between surface waves. Finally, we review the work done
to analyse the contribution of ﬂuctuating electromagnetic ﬁelds to the friction
forces.

2 Introduction to surface electromagnetic waves

In this section, we give a brief introduction to the main properties of elec-
tromagnetic surface waves. This particular type of waves exists at the inter-
face between two diﬀerent media. An electromagnetic surface wave propagates
along the interface and decreases exponentially in the perpendicular direction.
Surface waves due to a coupling between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and a reso-
nant polarization oscillation in the material are called surface polaritons. From
a microscopic point of view, the surface waves at the interface of a metal is a
charge density wave or plasmon. It is therefore called surface-plasmon polari-
ton. At the interface of a dielectric, the surface wave is due to the coupling
of an optical phonon with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. It is thus called surface-
phonon polariton. Plasmon polaritons and phonon polaritons can also exist
in the whole volume of the material and are called polaritons. More details
about this subject can be found in textbooks such as Kittel [11], Ashcroft and
Mermin [12] and Ziman [13]. In what follows, we will focus our attention on
surface polaritons propagating along a plane interface. Excellent reviews of
the subject can be found in [14,15,16,17].

Let us now study the existence and the behaviour of surface polaritons in
the case of a plane interface separating two linear, homogeneous and isotropic
media with diﬀerent dielectric constants. The system considered is depicted
in Fig.1.

Fig. 1. A plane interface separating medium 1 (dielectric constant ǫ1, magnetic

The medium 1 (dielectric constant ǫ1 and magnetic constant µ1) ﬁlls the up-
per half-space z > 0 whereas medium 2 (dielectric constant ǫ2 and magnetic
constant µ2) ﬁlls the lower half-space z < 0. The two media are supposed to be
local and dispersive so that their complex dielectric and magnetic constants
only depend on ω.

The three directions x, y, z shown in Fig.1 are characterized by their unit
vectors ˆx, ˆy, ˆz. A point in space will be denoted r = (x, y, z) = xˆx + y ˆy + zˆz =
(R, z) where R = xˆx + y ˆy. Similarly, a wave vector k = (kx, ky, kz) will be
denoted by k = (K, γ) where K is the component parallel to the interface and
γ = kz the component in the z direction.

A surface wave is a particular solution of Maxwell’s equations which prop-
agates along the interface and decreases exponentially in the perpendicular
directions. Because of the translational invariance of the system, it can be

When the media are non-magnetic, there are no surface waves in s-polarization.
Indeed, the imaginary part of the z-components γi is always positive, so that
γ1 + γ2 cannot be zero.
At a material-vacuum interface (ǫ1 = µ1 = 1), the dispersion relation reads
in p-polarization

It follows that the wave vector becomes very large for a frequency such that
ǫ(ω) + 1 = 0.
The conditions (9) and (17) corresponds to the poles of the Fresnel reﬂection
factors. To search these poles is an alternative and simple way to ﬁnd the
dispersion relation. This is particularly useful when searching the dispersion
relation for multilayers system.
For non-lossy media, one can ﬁnd a real K corresponding to a real ω. This
mode exists only if ǫ2 <
1 in the case of an interface separating a vacuum
from a material.
In the presence of losses, the dispersion relation yields two equations but
both frequency and wavector can be complex so that there are four pa-
rameters. Two cases are of practical interest : i) a real frequency and a
complex wavevector, ii) a complex frequency and a real wavector. These
two choices leads to diﬀerent shapes of the dispersion relation as discussed
in [18,19,20,21]. The imaginary part of ω describes the ﬁnite lifetime of the
mode due to losses. Conversely, for a given real ω, the imaginary part of K
yields a ﬁnite propagation length along the interface.
The dispersion relation (20) shows that for a real dielectric constant ǫ1 <
1,
K > ω/c. This mode cannot be excited by a plane wave whose wavevector is
such that K < ω/c. In order to excite this mode, it is necessary to increase
the wavevector. One can use a prism [14,22,23] or a grating [18]. A scatterer

can also generate a wave with the required wavevector.

2.2 Dispersion relation

In this subsection, we will consider two types of surface waves: surface-plasmon
polaritons and surface-phonon polaritons. Surface-plasmon polaritons are ob-
served at surfaces separating a dielectric from a medium with a gas of free
electrons such as a metal or a doped semiconductor. The dielectric constant
of the latter can be modelled by a Drude model :

ǫ(ω) = ǫ∞ −

ω2
p
ω2 + iΓω

,

where ωp is the plasma frequency and Γ accounts for the losses. Using this
model and neglecting the losses, we ﬁnd that the resonance condition ǫ(ω)+1 =
0 yields ω = ωp/√2. For most metals, this frequency lies in the near UV so that
these surface waves are more diﬃcult to excite thermally. By contrast, surface-
phonon polaritons can be excited thermally because they exist in the infrared.
They have been studied through measurements of emission and reﬂectivity
spectra by Zhizhin and Vinogradov [24]. Let us study the dispersion relation
of surface-phonon polaritons at a vacuum/Silicon Carbide (SiC) interface. SiC
is a non-magnetic material whose dielectric constant is well described by an
oscillator model in the [2-22 µm] range[25]:

with ωL = 969 cm−1, ωT = 793 cm−1, Γ = 4.76 cm−1 and ǫ∞ = 6.7. The
dispersion relation at a SiC/vacuum interface is represented in Fig.2. This
dispersion relation has been derived by assuming that the frequency ω is com-
plex and the parallel wavevector K is real. This choice is well suited to analyse
experimental measurements of spectra for ﬁxed angles. The width of the res-
onance peaks observed is related to the imaginary part of the frequency of
the mode. We note that the curve is situated below the light cone ω = cK so
that the surface wave is evanescent. We also observe a horizontal asymptote
for ωasym = 1.784 1014 rad s−1 so that there is a peak in the density of electro-
magnetic states. We will see in the next sections, that the existence of surface
modes at a particular frequency plays a key role in many phenomena.

In Fig.3, we have shown the dispersion relation obtained when choosing a
real frequency ω and a complex wavevector K. The real part of the complex
wavevector is represented. It is seen that the shape of the dispersion relation
is signiﬁcantly changed. A backbending of the curve is observed. This type

We have plotted in Fig.4 the surface wave decay length in the direction perpen-
dicular to the interface versus the wavelength. From Eqs (1) and (2), it is seen

that the amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld decreases exponentially in the
z direction with a decay length δ1 = 1/Im(γ1) in medium 1 and δ2 = 1/Im(γ2)
in medium 2. We note that the smallest penetration depth in SiC is obtained

for the frequency ωasym. At this frequency, losses are very large.

We study in Fig.5 the surface wave propagation length along a SiC-vacuum in-
terface. It is given by the inverse of the imaginary part of the parallel wavevec-
tor L = 1/Im(K). Around ωasym, L is minimum. It can be as large as several
tens of wavelengths.

It will be seen below that the existence of these surface modes is responsible
for a long coherence time and a long coherence length of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the near ﬁeld. They are essentially given by the lifetime and the decay
length of the surface wave.

3 Fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Cross-spectral density.

In this section, we introduce the tools and methods that are useful to derive
the ﬁeld radiated by a body in thermal equilibrium at temperature T both
in the near ﬁeld and in the far ﬁeld. Whereas the phenomelogical theory of
radiometry based on geometrical optics describes correctly the ﬁeld emitted
in the far ﬁeld, it fails to predict the behaviour of the emitted radiation in
the near ﬁeld. Indeed, geometrical optics does not include evanescent waves. A
new framework to describe thermal radiation is thus needed. Such a framework
has been introduced by Rytov [26,27] and is known as ﬂuctuational electrody-
namics. The key idea is that for any material in thermal equilibrium, charges
such as electrons in metals, or ions in polar crystals undergo a random thermal
motion. This generates ﬂuctuating currents which radiate an electromagnetic
ﬁeld. A body at temperature T is thus viewed as a medium with random
currents that radiate the thermal ﬁeld. The statistical properties of this ﬁeld
can be determined provided that i) the statistical properties of the random
currents are known, ii) the radiation of a volume element below an interface is
known. The ﬁrst information is given by the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem
(FDT), the second is given by the Green’s tensor of the system.

This approach is very similar to the Langevin model for Brownian motion.
Langevin [28] introduced a random force as a source for the dynamical equa-
tions of the particles. This allows to derive the statistical properties of their
random motion. An important feature of the model is that the random force
is not arbitrary. Its correlation function is related to the losses of the system
by the FDT. In the case of random electromagnetic ﬁelds, the dynamic equa-
tions for the ﬁelds are Maxwell equations. We need to introduce an external
random source to model the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld. These external sources
are random currents. The key issue now is to know the statistical properties
of these random sources. They are given by the FDT. The remaining of this
section introduces the technical tools needed to derive the radiated ﬁeld. The
ﬁrst part is devoted to the statistical properties of the random currents given
by the FDT, the second part deals with the FDT applied to the EM ﬁelds.
The Green’s tensor are given in appendix A.

3.1 Cross-spectral density

The spectral analysis of a signal is usually done using its Fourier transform.
In the case of a stationary stochastic signal, the Fourier transform cannot
be computed in the sense of a function because the integral is not square
integrable. However, it is possible to compute the Fourier transform of the
time-correlation function of the random signal. In what follows, we will be

Note that for r = r′, the above equation reduces to the Wiener-Khinchin

3.2 Fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the current density

The FDT derived by Callen and Welton [30] yields a general form of the
symmetrized correlation function of a vector X(r, r′, ω). Whereas for classi-
cal quantities, the symmetrization does not change the results, it plays an
important role in quantum mechanics for non-commuting observables. If the
cross-spectral density of X is deﬁned by
Xkl, we deﬁne the symmetrised cor-
relation function of X by:

3.3 Fluctuation-dissipation for the ﬁelds.

Another very useful application of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem yields
a relation between the cross-spectral density of the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds at equi-
librium and the Green’s tensor of the system [31]. The Green’s tensor appears
as the linear response coeﬃcient relating the ﬁelds to their sources. Note that
these quantities are deﬁned in classical electrodynamics. In what follows, we
will use three diﬀerent Green’s tensors deﬁned by:

These relations yield the coherence properties of the equilibrium ﬁeld provided
that the Green’s tensor of the system are known. Note that the Green’s tensor
is a classical object so that the vacuum ﬂuctuations are already included in
the above formalism. It is also important to note that the Green’s tensor can
be computed including the losses of the system.

3.4 Relation between symmetrized correlation function and observables

In what follows, we will use the FDT either with Θ(ω, T ) or with (~ω/2) coth[~ω/2kBT ] =
Θ(ω, T ) + ~ω/2. The former amounts to drop the vacuum energy ~ω/2. This
choice can be justiﬁed using a heuristic argument [27]. When it comes to the
derivation of ﬂuxes, the vacuum energy cancels when taking the diﬀerence
between emission and absorption[27]. Instead, when computing the Casimir
force, one has ﬁrst to compute the energy variation of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the space between two parallel plates. In that case, the vacuum ﬂuc-
tuation energy ~ω/2 plays a fundamental role and cannot be ignored so that
it is kept in the calculation. This procedure may seem arbitrary. A more rig-
orous approach to the choice of the relevant form of the FDT can be derived
from quantum electrodynamics as discussed by Agarwal [31]. It can be shown

14

that when the process studied involves an absorption measurement, the rel-
evant correlation function is the normally ordered correlation function [29].
If the measurement involves a quantum counter, then one needs to calculate
the antinormally ordered correlation function [29]. The relevant forms of the
FDT are given in the paper by Agarwal [31]. We show in Appendix B that
one can end up with an eﬀective cross-spectral density deﬁned for positive
frequencies only. This eﬀective cross-spectral density depends on the type of
measurement. The time-correlation function can be written as :

and the cross-spectral density appropriate for a quantum-counter measure-
ment is given by:

(A)

kl (r, r′, ω) = 4ωµ0Im[GEE

kl (r, r′, ω)][Θ(ω, T ) + ~ω].

Only the latter includes the energy of vacuum ﬂuctuations. For the sake of
comparison, we also report the symmetrised form apropriate for positive fre-
quencies only :

(S)
kl (r, r′, ω) = 4ωµ0Im[GE

kl(r, r′, ω)][Θ(ω, T ) +

].

A simple rule can thus be used when starting with the usual symmetrised
FDT as given by (36) in order to get the relevant correlation function for a
process involving absorption: 1) restrict the spectrum to positive frequencies,
2) multiply the spectrum by 2, 3) remove the energy ﬂuctuation contribution,
4) take the real part.

3.5 Fluctuational electrodynamics out of equilibrium

In the previous section, we have given the form of the cross-spectral densities of
the ﬁelds and current densities at equilibrium. However, it is possible to derive
the ﬁelds radiated by a system out of equilibrium. The approach is based on
the FDT for the current density. Assuming local thermal equilibrium, we can

15

derive the statistical properties of the currents. We can thus derive the ﬁelds
radiated by a system with an inhomogeneous temperature ﬁeld. Although
the mean values of the ﬁelds are zero, their correlation are non-zero. Let us
consider for instance the symmetrized cross-spectral correlation function of
the electric ﬁeld

(43)

With the help of the FDT, we have seen that it is possible to calculate all
kind of cross-spectral spatial correlation functions involving the electric and
the magnetic ﬁelds. With these functions, we are now able to calculate other
quantities such as the energy density, the Poynting vector or the Maxwell stress
tensor. In the case of thermal equilibrium situations, we will use the application
of the FDT for the ﬁelds which give simpler expressions. Nevertheless, in non-
equilibrium situation such as the study of heat transfer between materials held
at diﬀerent temperature, these expressions are no longer valid. It is however
still possible to use the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem for the currents by
assuming local thermal equilibrium. It will thus be possible to derive the ﬂuxes
for non-equilibrium situations.

4 Electromagnetic energy density and Local Density Of States

(LDOS)

In this section, we will study how the electromagnetic energy density is mod-
iﬁed by the presence of material media. We shall ﬁrst examine the amount
of electromagnetic energy emitted by a half-space at temperature T . It will
be shown that the density of energy is dramatically diﬀerent in the near ﬁeld
and in the far ﬁeld when surface waves are excited. The second point that we
address is the general problem of the deﬁnition of the local density of electro-
magnetic states. Whereas it is possible to derive the density of electromagnetic
states for a non-lossy system by searching the eigenmodes, the lossy case is
more diﬃcult. An alternative approach was introduced by Agarwal [33] based
on the FDT. Using this approach, we will discuss the role of surface waves.

4.1 Density of emitted electromagnetic energy

Let us return to the conﬁguration described in Fig.1. We calculate the elec-
tromagnetic energy density in the vacuum above a material (medium 2) at
temperature T due to the emission of this material. We do not take into ac-
count the energy incident on the medium. In order to retrieve the density of
energy at equilibrium, we should include the energy incident on the surface.
The density of energy in vacuum reads (See Jackson [34] p.242)

4.2 Discussion

In order to illustrate this discussion, we study the density of electromagnetic
energy above some speciﬁc materials. Let us ﬁrst consider a material support-
ing surface waves in the infrared such as SiC. In Fig.6, we plot the energy
density utot(z, ω) versus the frequency at diﬀerent distances of a semi-inﬁnite
interface of SiC. The semi-inﬁnite medium is at temperature T = 300 K
whereas the vacuum is at T = 0 K. Note that at T = 300 K, Wien’s law gives
a peak wavelength for thermal radiation λW ien = 10µm. In the far ﬁeld, i.e.
for distances d larger than λW ien/2π, the energy density spectrum resembles
that of a blackbody. The diﬀerence with a Planck spectrum comes from the
fact that SiC is a very reﬂecting material around λ = 10µm or ω = 1.7 1014
rad s−1. Thus, its emissivity is small in this frequency interval. This property

In the far ﬁeld, the evanescent waves do not contribute to the energy density
because of the exponential decay (e−2Im(γ1)z). We note that if medium 2 is
totally absorbing (rs,p
12 = 0), the energy density due to propagating waves is
half the energy calculated in a vacuum at thermal equilibrium. This is not
surprising since we are computing only the emitted part of the radiation. In
the case of equilibrium radiation, there is also the contribution of the radiation
coming from the upper half space. We note that in (46), the emissivity appears
2)/2. It is thus the half sum of the
to be (1
energy transmission factors for both polarizations. Thermal emission by a
half-space can be viewed as a transmission process of a blackbody radiation
in the material medium through an interface. This point of view yields insight
in Kirchhoﬀ’s law. Indeed, the equality between emissivity and absorptivity
appears to be a consequence of the equality of the transmission factor when
interchanging source and detector.

At a distance z = 3µm which is slightly larger than λW ien/2π, the energy
density spectrum changes drastically and a strong peak emerges. At 100 nm
from the interface, one observes that the thermal emission is almost monochro-

19

matic around ω = 1.78 1014rad s−1. At this frequency the energy density has
increased by more than four orders of magnitude. The peak corresponds to
the excitation of a surface wave. This distance is in agreement with the decay
length of the surface waves as discussed in Section 2. At distances much smaller
than the wavelength, we enter a regime that we call extreme near ﬁeld. The
leading contribution comes from the very large wavevectors K in the energy
density integral. At large K, it can be shown that γ1 ∼

showing that the energy density will diverge at the frequencies where ǫ1 =
1. These are the frequencies where the dispersion relation has horizontal
−
asymptotes. For lossy materials, a resonance will occur at the frequency where
Re(ǫ2) =
1 provided that absorption (i.e Im[ǫ2]) is not too large. Let us
mention that the resonance of the reﬂection factor in the electrostatic limit
has been observed experimentally by Hillenbrand et al.[3]. A spectrum of the
light scattered by a tip very close to a surface shows a peak for the resonance
frequency. This peak is due to the ﬁeld emitted by the image of the tip. Indeed,

In order to prove that this surprising behaviour is not speciﬁc to SiC, we
plot in Fig.7, the energy density spectrum above a ﬂat interface of glass. This
material is amorphous so that the optical phonons are poorly deﬁned. Here
again, the energy density spectrum resembles that of a blackbody in the far
ﬁeld whereas peaks emerge while approaching the surface. The strongest peak
is at ω = 9.2 1013 rad s−1 and the weakest one at ω = 2.2 1014 rad s−1. These
frequencies are solution of Re[ǫ2(ω)] =
1. Yet, the corresponding surface
−
waves have a very short propagation length.

Not all materials supporting surface waves exhibit strong peaks in their near-
ﬁeld thermal energy density spectrum. Indeed, as it can be seen in (48), a
peak is exhibited if the frequency where ǫ2(ω) approaches -1 corresponds to a
frequency range where Θ(ω, T ) is not too small. For example, metals exhibit
surface-plasmon polariton in the UV or visible range where Θ(ω, T ) is expo-
nentially small at ambient temperature. Thus metals do not exhibit strong
peak in their thermal energy density spectrum in the near ﬁeld.

4.3 Local Density Of States

The density of states (DOS) is a fundamental quantity from which many
macroscopic quantities can be derived. In statistical physics, the DOS allows
to calculate the partition function of a system from which all the macroscopic
properties follow. The local density of states (LDOS) is useful to study a non-
uniform system. The local density of electronic states is widely used in solid
state physics. It has been shown [36] for instance that a scanning tunneling
microscope images the electronic LDOS. The local character of the LDOS
clearly describes the spatial distribution of electrons in the solid. A similar
spatial dependence is also relevant for electromagnetic waves. Whereas the
intensity is uniform in a vacuum in equilibrium, this is not the case in a
waveguide or above an interface. The distribution of the energy is no longer
uniform. Whereas LDOS is well deﬁned for electrons in solid state physics [37],
its electromagnetic counterpart is not very well deﬁned in the literature. As
compared to electronic systems, two diﬀerences must be taken into account :
the vectorial nature of the ﬁelds and the existence of losses.

In electrodynamics, the LDOS is used in diﬀerent contexts. From Fermi’s
golden rule, it is known that the DOS determines the radiation rate. It can be
shown that the lifetime of an atom with an electric dipole along a unit vector
GEE
u is inversely proportional to Im[u
u]. This is often refered to as the
LDOS. To avoid confusion, we shall refer to this quantity as the projected
LDOS. It is the relevant quantity that one needs to study when designing a
microcavity or a photonic crystal to tailor emission properties. Yet, note that
only those states that can be coupled to the dipole are taken into account.
Thus it is not a good deﬁnition if one is interested in the total energy of the
system. Such a quantity is required when computing dispersion forces [38,39]
or shear forces [40] for instance. Those forces depend on the energy stored
in all available modes. In a vacuum, the LDOS can be shown to be given by

·

·

the imaginary part of the trace of the Green’s tensor
. This seems to
be a straightforward extension of the scalar result which is proportional to
the imaginary part of the Green function. The vacuum form is thus usually
assumed to be valid for any other situations [41,42,43]. In what follows, we
will summarize a recent analysis of the LDOS [44] that follows the original
approach by Agarwal [33]. It will be seen that the LDOS is not given by the

We consider a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T . In a vacuum,

We can now introduce [7,44] a local density of states by using as a starting
point the local density of electromagnetic energy U(r, ω) at a given point r in
space, and at a given angular frequency ω. This can be written by deﬁnition
of the LDOS ρ(r, ω) as

U(r, ω) = ρ(r, ω)

The density of electromagnetic energy is the sum of the density of electric
energy and of the density of magnetic energy given in (44). In equilibrium,
it can be calculated using the system Green’s function and the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. We start from the electric and magnetic ﬁeld correlation
functions for a stationary system

In what follows, we shall discuss a few examples to illustrate the modiﬁcation
of the LDOS. It will be seen that in some cases, the LDOS is accurately given
by the trace of the electric Green’s dyadic but it can also be very diﬀerent.

22

The LDOS is thus obtained by multiplying the electric ﬁeld contribution by
2. After taking the trace, the usual result for a vacuum is retrieved

ρv(r, ω) = ρv(ω) =

ω2
π2c3 .

As expected, we note that the LDOS is homogeneous and isotropic.

4.4.2 Plane interface

We now consider a plane interface separating a vacuum (medium 1 in the upper
half-space) from a semi-inﬁnite material (medium 2, in the lower half-space)
characterised by its complex dielectric constant ǫ2(ω). The material is assumed
to be homogeneous, linear, isotropic and non-magnetic. The expression of the
LDOS at a given frequency and at a given height z above the interface in
vacuum is obtained by inserting the expressions of the electric and magnetic
Green’s tensors for this geometry [45] into equation (54). Note that in the
presence of an interface, the magnetic and electric Green’s tensors are no longer
the same. Indeed, the boundary counditions at the interface are diﬀerent for
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

Let us consider some speciﬁc examples for real materials like metals and di-
electrics. We ﬁrst calculate ρ(z, ω) for aluminum at diﬀerent heights. Alu-
minum is a metal whose dielectric constant is well described by a Drude model
for near-UV, visible and near-IR frequencies [46]:

heights. We ﬁrst note that the LDOS increases drastically when the distance to

Fig. 8. LDOS versus frequency at diﬀerent heights above a semi-inﬁnite sample of
aluminum. From [44]

the material is reduced. As discussed in the previous paragraph, at larger dis-
tances from the material, one retrieves the vacuum density of states. Note that
at a given distance, it is always possible to ﬁnd a suﬃciently high frequency for
which the corresponding wavelength is small compared to the distance so that
a far-ﬁeld situation is retrieved. This is clearly seen when looking at the curve
for z = 1µm which coincides with the vacuum LDOS. When the distance to
the material is decreased, additional modes are present: these are the evanes-
cent modes which are conﬁned close to the interface and which cannot be seen
in the far ﬁeld. Moreover, aluminum exhibits a resonance around ω = ωp/√2.
Below this frequency, the material supports surface-plasmon polaritons so that
these additional modes are seen in the near ﬁeld. This produces an increase of
the LDOS close to the interface. The enhancement is particularly important at
the resonant frequency which corresponds to Re[ǫ2(ω)] =
1. This behaviour
is analogous to that previously described in the electromagnetic energy density
paragraph for a glass surface supporting surface-phonon polaritons. Also note
that in the low frequency regime, the LDOS increases. Finally, Fig.8 shows
that it is possible to have a LDOS smaller than that of vacuum at some par-
ticular distances and frequencies. Fig.9 shows the propagating and evanescent
waves contributions to the LDOS above an aluminum sample at a distance of
10 nm. The propagating contribution is very similar to that of the vacuum
LDOS. As expected, the evanescent contribution dominates at low frequency
and around the surface-plasmon polariton resonance, where pure near-ﬁeld
contributions dominate.

Let us now turn to the comparison of ρ(z, ω) with the usual deﬁnition often
encountered in the literature[41,42,43], which corresponds to ρE(z, ω). We plot

In this ﬁgure, it is possible to identify three diﬀerent domains for the LDOS
behaviour. We note again that in the far-ﬁeld situation (corresponding here to
high frequencies i.e. λ/2π
z), the LDOS reduces to the vacuum situation.
In this case ρ(z, ω) = 2ρE(z, ω) = 2ρH(z, ω). Around the resonance, the LDOS
is dominated by the electric contribution ρE. Conversely, at low frequencies,
ρH (z, ω) dominates. Thus, Fig.10 shows that we have to be very careful when
using the approximation ρ(z, ω) = ρE(z, ω). Above aluminum and at a dis-
tance z = 10 nm, it is only valid in a narrow range between ω = 1016 rad s−1
1016 rad s−1, i.e. around the frequency where the surface wave
and ω = 1.5
exists.

4.4.3 Asymptotic form of the LDOS in the near-ﬁeld

In order to get more physical insight, we have calculated the asymptotic LDOS
behaviour in the three regimes mentioned above. As we have already seen, the
z) corresponds to the vacuum case. To study the
far-ﬁeld regime (λ/2π
≪
near-ﬁeld situation (λ/2π
z), we focus on the evanescent contribution due
to the large wavevectors K as suggested by the results in Fig.9. In this (quasi-
static) limit, the Fresnel reﬂection factors reduce to

Asymptotically, the expressions of ρE(z, ω) and ρH(z, ω) are[44]:

At a distance z = 10 nm above an aluminum surface, these asymptotic expres-
sions matches almost perfectly with the evanescent contributions (K > k0) of
ρE and ρH. These expressions also show that for a given frequency, one can
always ﬁnd a distance z to the interface below which the dominant contribu-
tion to the LDOS will be the one due to the imaginary part of the electric-
ﬁeld Green function that varies like (k0z)−3. But for aluminum at a distance
z = 10 nm, this is not the case for all frequencies. As we mentioned before,
this is only true around the resonance. For example, at low frequencies, and
for z = 10 nm, the LDOS is actually dominated by ρvǫ

2/(16k0z).

4.4.4 Spatial oscillations of the LDOS

Let us now focus on the LDOS variations at a given frequency ω versus the
distance z to the interface. There are essentially three regimes. First, for dis-
tances much larger than the wavelength, the LDOS is given by the vacuum
expression ρv. The second regime is observed close to the interface where os-
cillations are observed. Indeed, at a given frequency, each incident plane wave
on the interface can interfere with its reﬂected counterpart. This generates an
interference pattern with a fringe spacing that depends on the angle and the
frequency. Upon adding the contributions of all the plane waves over angles,
the oscillating structure disappears except close to the interface. This leads to
oscillations around distances on the order of the wavelength. This phenomenon

26

is the electromagnetic analog of Friedel oscillations which can be observed in
the electronic density of states near interfaces [12,47]. For a highly reﬂecting
material, the real part of the reﬂection coeﬃcients are negative so that the
LDOS decreases while approaching the surface. These two regimes are clearly
observed for aluminum in Fig. 11. The third regime is observed at small dis-
tances as seen in Fig. 11. It is due to the contribution of surface waves. Its
behaviour is thus dependent on the frequency. Let us ﬁrst consider the partic-
ular case of the frequency corresponding to the asymptote of the dispersion
relation. It is seen that the evanescent contribution dominates and ultimately
the LDOS always increases as 1/z3, following the behaviour found in (60).
This is the usual quasi-static contribution that is always found at short dis-
tance [35]. At a frequency slightly lower than the resonance frequency, surface

waves are still excited on the surface. These modes increase the LDOS accord-
ing to an exponential law, a behaviour which was already found for thermally
emitted ﬁelds [8,35].

4.4.5 Conclusion about the LDOS

The main results of this section can be summarized as follows. The LDOS
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be unambiguously and properly deﬁned from
the local density of electromagnetic energy in a vacuum above a sample at
temperature T in equilibrium. The LDOS can still be written as a function of
the electric-ﬁeld Green’s tensor only, but it is in general not proportional to
the trace of its imaginary part. An additional term proportional to the trace
of the imaginary part of the magnetic-ﬁeld Green’s tensor is present in the far
ﬁeld and at low frequencies. At short distance from the surface of a material
supporting surface modes (plasmon or phonon-polaritons), the LDOS has a
resonance at frequencies such that Re[ǫ(ω)] =
1. Close to this resonance,
the approximation ρ(z, ω) = ρE(z, ω) holds. If it is possible to measure the

−

27

near-ﬁeld thermal emission spectrum of a material, the local density of states
can be retrieved [44].

5 Coherence properties of planar thermal sources in the near-ﬁeld

In this section, we examine the second order coherence properties of the ﬁelds
due to thermal excitation in the presence of surface waves. We have shown that
the density of energy is completely dominated by the contribution of surface
waves in the near ﬁeld. We shall see that they are also responsible for a deep
modiﬁcation of coherence properties. In what follows, we restrict ourselves to
second-order coherence properties.

5.1 Spatial coherence in the near ﬁeld

The spatial coherence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is characterized by its cross-
Ekl(r, r′, ω). Roughly speaking, we study the correlation func-
spectral density
tion of the electromagnetic ﬁeld at two diﬀerent points for a particular fre-
quency. For a system in thermal equilibrium, this quantity is readily given by
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (36). The spatial dependence is thus in-
cluded in the spatial dependence of the imaginary part of the Green’s tensor.
For the particular case of a vacuum, one ﬁnds the properties of the blackbody
radiation. The Green’s tensor is given in appendix A. When taking its imagi-
nary part, it is seen that the spatial dependence of the cross-spectral density is
proportional to sin(kr)/kr. The typical length scale of the correlation function
for the blackbody radiation is thus the wavelength λ = 2π/k.

It is more interesting to analyse what happens in the presence of an interface.
It turns out that the coherence length may be either much larger or much
smaller than the wavelength. This problem has been studied in [8,35] for a
slightly diﬀerent case. The authors considered the coherence properties of the
ﬁeld emitted by a solid. The diﬀerence with the above result is that in equi-
librium, one has to consider two contributions : i) the blackbody radiation
illuminating the surface and reﬂected by the surface, ii) the radiation emitted
by the surface. In what follows, we focus only on the emitted part of the ra-
diation so that we do not consider the equilibrium situation. The correlation
is given by (43). This equation is valid inasmuch as the temperature T can
be deﬁned everywhere in a half-space. It requires a local thermal equilibrium.
We have represented in Fig.12 the cross-spectral density of the electric ﬁeld
for diﬀerent metallic surfaces at a given distance z = 0.05λ to the interface.
It is seen that the correlation oscillates and has an exponentially decaying en-
veloppe. The decay length is much larger han the wavelength indicating that

The long range correlation is due to surface plasmon polaritons for metals and to
surface phonon polaritons for SiC. From [8]

r1 −
|

r2|

the ﬁelds are coherent over large distances. This surprising phenomenon is due
to the excitation of surface waves along the interface. The physical mechanism
is based on the fact that a small volume element contains random currents
that excite a surface wave. This surface wave propagates along the interface
over distances larger than the wavelength. It follows that diﬀerent points may
be illuminated by the same random source so that they are correlated. Accord-
ingly, one does not expect any correlation between the s-polarized ﬁeld since
no surface wave exists for s-polarization. If one uses a material with a real
part of the dielectric constant larger than
1, no surface wave can propagate
so that no correlation should be observed. We have shown in Fig.12 the case
of tungsten in the visible that does not support surface waves. It is seen that
the coherence length is smaller than a wavelength so that the radiation ﬁeld
appears to be more incoherent than blackbody radiation. It has been shown
in [35] that in the short distance regime, the coherence length is given by z.

−

A similar behaviour is observed for SiC, a polar material that supports surface-
phonon polaritons in a frequency band. Within this band, at a wavelength
11.36µm the correlation is seen to be a long-range correlation whereas the
correlation decays very rapidly for a wavelength (9.1µm) that is not in the
band where surface waves exist.

Let us discuss in simple terms the physical origin of these unusual coherence
properties. The long-range coherence is unexpected because the ﬂuctuating

29

currents are delta correlated as shown by the FDT. This is the reason why
the ﬁelds are usually assumed to be delta-correlated in space. However, the
ﬂuctuating currents excite induced currents in the material. In the case of
a metal, a surface plasmon can be excited. In the case of a polar crystal,
a surface-phonon polariton can be excited. Both surface waves are extended
modes along the surface. The induced currents associated with these extended
modes are therefore coherent over large distances. More precisely, the coher-
ence length is expected to be given by the decay length of these surface modes.
This has been conﬁrmed by a detailed asymptotic analysis in [35].

The other surprising property shown in Fig.12 is that the coherence length
deﬁned as the FWMH of the cross-spectral density can be smaller than the
wavelength. In other words, a source can be more spatially incoherent than
the blackbody radiation. The key idea is that close to an interface, the ﬁeld
contains evanescent waves so that features smaller than the wavelength can
exist. This is not the case in a vacuum so that the ﬁeld has a minimum
coherence length. Since the amplitude of evanescent waves of large wave vector
Kz), it is clear that the distance z appears as a cutoﬀ
K decays as exp(
frequency. This explains that the coherence length increases as z in the near-
ﬁeld regime.

−

5.2 Temporal coherence in the near ﬁeld

The temporal coherence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is characterized by the
same point time-correlation function of the electromagnetic ﬁeld :

Ek(r, t + τ )El(r, t)
h

i

.

(62)

This correlation function is a measurement of the memory of the random
ﬁeld. It is useful to introduce a typical decay time tcoh of the correlation func-
tion called coherence time. A Michelson interferometer with aligned mirrors
performs a measurement of the correlation function. Indeed, the interference
term of the signal can be written as E(r, t + τ )E(r, t) where τ is the ﬂight
time corresponding to the optical path length diﬀerence δopt between the two
paths δopt = cτ . If the path-length diﬀerence is larger than the longitudinal
coherence length ctcoh, no interferences can be observed.

The temporal coherence of the EM ﬁeld is related to its power spectral density.
This is clearly seen by using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem [29,48] which shows
that the power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the correlation

30

function. Alternatively, we can start from (36). It follows that

Let us ﬁrst consider the temporal coherence of the ﬁeld in a vacuum. The
imaginary part of the Green’s tensor does not diverge and yields zero for
non diagonal terms and ω/6πc for diagonal terms. It follows that the time
correlation function of the blackbody radiation is given by :

Since the integrand has a large spectral width, it appears that the coherence
time is on the order of the peak radiation period.

If we now consider the case of an interface, we know that the spectrum can
be very diﬀerent in the near ﬁeld. We have seen previously that the contribu-
tion of the surface wave modiﬁes dramatically the density of electromagnetic
energy. In particular, we have seen that the density of energy becomes quasi-
monochromatic which suggests a large coherence time. More speciﬁcally, in
the extreme near ﬁeld, we have seen in (59) that the Green’s function has a
resonant denominator ǫ + 1. Close to the resonance where Re[ǫ(ω0)] =
1, we
can expand the dielectric constant as :

−

ǫ(ω) =

1 + iǫ′′(ω0) + (ω

ω0)

−

−

where we have used the notation ǫ = ǫ′ + iǫ′′. The denominator ǫ + 1 can be
cast in the form:

ǫ(ω) + 1 =

dǫ′
dω !

 

[ω

ω0 + iΓ],

−

where Γ = ǫ′′(ω0)/ dǫ′
dω . It is seen that the Green’s dyadic has a pole at the
frequency corresponding to the asymptote of the dispersion relation of the
surface wave. Its contribution to the integral (64) yields an exponential de-
cay of the form exp[iω0t
Γt]. It follows that in the extreme near ﬁeld, the
thermally emitted ﬁeld is partially temporally coherent with a coherence time
given by Γ−1. The origin of the temporal coherence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
can thus be assigned to the very large density of states due to the asymptote
of the surface wave. It follows that whereas the plane interface of a hot metal-
lic surface is a temporally incoherent source for an atom located in the far

−

(65)

(66)

31

ﬁeld, it is a partially temporally coherent source for an atom located within a
nanometric distance from the interface.

5.3 Polarization coherence in the near ﬁeld

We have seen that the excitation of surface waves by delta-correlated currents
produces both a spatial and a temporal coherence. The correlation of the ﬁeld
is characterized by the decay time and the decay length of the surface wave
that propagates along the interface. There is a further interesting coherence
eﬀect that has been studied by Set¨al¨a et al. [49]. The basic idea is that surface
waves are p-polarized waves. As shown in section 2, a surface wave that prop-
agates along the y axis has an electric ﬁeld with two components along the y
and z axis. It follows that the y and z components of the ﬁeld are correlated.

The study of correlation of the ﬁelds in the near ﬁeld of the source cannot be
performed using the standard formalism. Indeed, when dealing with a beam,
it is usually possible to work with the two components of the ﬁeld perpen-
dicular to the propagation axis. This is no longer possible in the near ﬁeld
of a thermal source. A generalization of the degree of polarization has been
introduced in [49]. It was found that the degree of polarization varies as a
function of the distance to the interface. Like the coherence time, it increases
when approaching the interface from the far ﬁeld because the surface wave
creates a correlation. When reaching the very near-ﬁeld regime, the degree of
polarization decays and tends to 1/4 for all the materials.

6 Spatially partially coherent thermal sources in the far ﬁeld

6.1 Introduction

In this section, we will discuss the possibility of designing a source that is
spatially partially coherent. In simple terms, a spatially partially coherent
source is a source that radiates a ﬁeld which has a narrow angular aperture at
a given wavelength. The typical examples of coherent sources are lasers and
antennas. These sources have well deﬁned emission angular lobes. In what
follows, we will show that a narrow angular emission lobe is a signature of the
spatial coherence of the ﬁeld in the plane of the source.

We ﬁrst introduce an analogue of the Wiener Khinchin theorem (WKT) (63)
to analyse the spatial coherence of the ﬁeld. In simple terms, WKT states
that a quasi monochromatic source with bandwidth ∆ν has a coherence time

32

roughly equal to 1/∆ν. Similarly, a quasi parallel beam with a spatial fre-
quency bandwidth ∆kx has a transverse coherence length 2π/∆kx. A formal
proof is based on two properties : the relationship between the cross-spectral
density of the ﬁeld in the plane of the source z = 0 and the power spectral
density of the ﬁeld, the relationship between the power radiated in far ﬁeld
and the power spectral density. For a translationally invariant system, the
Fourier transform of the ﬁeld does not converge in the sense of a function.
Yet, one can deﬁne a ﬁeld equal to the random ﬁeld in a square of area A and
null outside. We can now deﬁne the Fourier transform of the ﬁeld in the plane
z = 0 as :

EA(rk, ω) =

Z

d2K
4π2 EA(K, ω) exp(iK

It can be shown [48] that the WKT yields a relation between the cross-spectral
density and the power spectral density of the spectrum of the ﬁeld :

This relation implies that if the spectrum has a bandwidth smaller than 2π/λ,
the coherence length is larger than λ. The second step is to show that the band-
/A is given by the
width of the spectrum power density
emission pattern in the far ﬁeld. Indeed, the ﬁeld can be written everywhere
as [50,29] :

link between the directivity of the emitted ﬁeld and the coherence of the ﬁeld
in the plane of the source. It is clear that a directional source implies a narrow
spectrum and therefore a large correlation length.

6.2 Design of coherent thermal sources

We have seen in the previous section that a source which supports a surface
wave is partially spatially coherent along the surface. However, because these
waves cannot propagate in a vacuum, the coherence remains conﬁned in the
vicinity of the surface. The question that we address now is whether it is
possible to export the near-ﬁeld coherence to the far ﬁeld. In essence, that
amounts to couple the surface waves to the propagating waves. This can be
done in several ways. A practical way is to rule a grating on the surface.
The grating can then diﬀract the surface wave. By properly choosing the
period of the grating, it is possible to control the angle of propagation of the
diﬀracted light. This was ﬁrst observed in [51,52,53] for a very deep grating
ruled on a doped silicon surface. Such a material supports surface-plasmon
polaritons in the infrared. A more eﬀective source was realized using a gold
grating by Kreiter et al. [54]. Heinzel et al. [55] have also realized a source
using surface plasmons on tungsten in the near infrared. A source based on
the use of surface-phonon polaritons on SiC was reported by Le Gall et al.
[18]. The ﬁrst discussion of the spatial coherence of these sources was reported
in [10]. An extended discussion of these properties has been recently reported
[56] where transverse coherence lengths have been derived from experimental
measurements of angular widths of emission peaks. Angular peaks as narrow
as 1◦ can be obtained.

In order to have an eﬃcient source of light, it is necessary to make sure that
the coupling of the surface wave into a propagating wave is optimum. This
can be accomplished by designing a surface with total absorption. From Kirch-
hoﬀ’s law, it follows that if absorption is unity, then emissivity is also unity.
Another condition must be satisﬁed : the emission wavelength should lie in
a region where Planck’s function takes large values. The optimum choice of
the wavelength thus depends on the temperature of the source. Fig.13 shows
the angular emission pattern of a SiC grating. It is clearly seen that the an-
gular aperture is very narrow indicating a large coherence length [56]. Let us
emphasize that the coherence is not due to to the grating but only to the
surface wave. The role of the grating is merely to couple the surface wave into
a propagating wave.

Diﬀerent schemes have been proposed to produce partially coherent thermal
sources. They are based on a ﬁltering of the emission pattern in order to re-
duce the angular width of the emission pattern. The scheme that we have

described so far is based on the use of a grating that couples a surface wave
to propagating wave can be viewed as a device that increases the absorptiv-
ity or emissivity to 1 for a narrow set of angles. It can thus be viewed as a
ﬁltering process. A diﬀerent type of ﬁlter can be designed using multilayers
systems. Several authors [57,58] have reported a narrow angular pattern emis-
sion obtained by interferences between several layers. This mechanism leads
to angular widths on the order of 10◦.

6.3 Engineering radiative properties of surfaces

For many applications, it is desirable to modify radiative properties of sur-
faces. An introduction to radiative properties of surfaces can be found in a
review paper by Z. Zhang [59]. Roughness has often been used to increase the
emissivity. An analysis of the diﬀerent mechanisms involved can be found in
[60]. Further references on scattering by rough surfaces can be found in several
reviews and monographs [50,61,62,63,64,65]. Microstructures can be used to
design eﬃcient selective absorbers and sources. The decay of reﬂectivity of a
shallow rough surface due to the excitation of surface plasmons is addressed
in [66]. Hava and coworkers have examined silicon microstructured surfaces
[67,68,69,70]. Sai et al. [71] have designed silicon microstructured surfaces for
thermophotovoltaics applications. Marquier et al.[72] have studied the eﬀect
of surface plasmon on highly doped silicon showing that the peak absorption
frequency can be tuned by varying the doping. Kusunoki et al. [73] have re-
ported emissivity measurements on tantalum surfaces with two-dimensional

35

periodic structures. They observed peaks of emission due to the excitation of
surface plasmons. Pralle et al. [74] have designed selective infrared emitters
using periodic structures on silicon wafers coated with gold.

c sin(θ) = K(ω) + p 2π

An interesting application of surface waves to the enhancement of light emis-
sion has been demonstrated by Marquier et al. [56,72]. The idea is to emit
light in all directions at a given frequency. To this aim, it is necessary to be
able to couple light in all directions. When using a grating of period d, the
emission angle θ is given by ω
d where p is an integer.
The key idea is to work at the resonance frequency taking advantage that the
dispersion relation is ﬂat. At that particular frequency, surface plasmons exist
for a very large set of wavevectors K. It follows that one can design a source
emitting in all directions. This has been demonstrated for a SiC surface on
which a grating was ruled. Fig.14 represents the angular emission pattern. It is
seen that the emissivity is close to its maximum value 1 and almost isotropic.
The mechanism of emission can be again viewed as a two steps process. First,
each volume element is equivalent to a random dipole that can either emit a
photon or excite a surface wave. The latter is a very eﬃcient process so that
usually, most of the desexcitation goes into surface waves and eventually into
heat. The second step is the introduction of a grating that converts the surface
wave into a propagating wave by diﬀraction. Thus, the excitation of a surface
wave which usually tends to decrease the emission of light becomes a factor
that enhances the emission of light. A similar mechanism has been proposed
recently to use the surface waves in order to enhance the emission of light
by quantum wells placed close to a metallic layer [75,76]. The idea is that the
high density of states due to the surface plasmon enhances the emission. If the
conversion of a surface wave into a propagating wave is eﬃcient, the process

36

enhances the emission.

7 Radiative heat transfer in the near ﬁeld

We have shown previously that the density of electromagnetic energy increases
in the near ﬁeld due to the contribution of surface waves. We now address the
question of heat transfer between bodies separated by distances smaller than
the wavelength. In that case, it is expected to observe contributions of the
surface waves to the radative heat transfer. This topic has already a long his-
tory. Anomalous radiative heat transfer was observed in the sixties. Cravalho
et al. [77], Boehm and Tien [78] studied that problem and took into account
waves that are propagative in the materials and evanescent in the vacuum
gap. Yet, this correction does not take into account all the evanescent waves.
Waves that are evanescent on both sides of the interface (i.e. surface modes)
were not taken into account in these early works. The ﬁrst correct derivation
of the ﬂux between two plane parallel plates was reported by Polder and Van
Hove [79] in 1971. Their method allowed them to analyse the contributions of
diﬀerent polarizations and to compute separately the contributions of evanes-
cent and propagating waves. Similar works were reported later on by diﬀerent
authors [80,81,82,83,84,85]. It is found in all these works that the ﬂux diverges
as the distance decreases. This point was considered to be unphysical in [86,87]
where the increase in the density of states due to surface waves was not in-
cluded. It is pointed out in [88,89] that when keeping the contribution of all
the wavevectors, the ﬂux diverges if the temperature diﬀerence is assumed to
be kept to a constant value. This amounts to say that the thermal resistance
goes to zero which does not violate any physical law. Only a few experiments
[90,91,92] were reported on measurements of heat transfer due to near-ﬁeld
radiation.

Heat transfer between a plane and a small particle was ﬁrst discussed by Doro-
feyev [93] and later by Pendry [82] and Volokitin and Persson [83]. Practical re-
sults were derived for a metal using a Drude model and making the additional
>> 1. Mulet et al. [94] pointed out the resonant contribu-
assumption that
tion of surface waves to the heat transfer. It was shown that the heat transfer
is quasimonochromatic at the frequency of the optical phonons for a polar
crystal given by Re[ǫ(ω)] + 1 = 0. A similar eﬀect is observed between metal-
lic parallel surfaces [85] and for doped semiconductors [72]. For metals, this
resonance does not play a signiﬁcant role because the plasma frequency is in
the UV domain so that the Bose-Einstein factor takes low values at usual tem-
peratures. It was later suggested [10,95] that a quasi-monochromatic enhanced
heat transfer could be used to increase the eﬃciency of thermophotovoltaics
devices by matching the energy of the emitted photons with the absorption
band gap of the photovoltaics cell. That might reduce the loss of excess energy

37

of ultraviolet photons. The heat transfer between two small particles has been
studied in [83]. It has been shown that the dipole-dipole interaction yields a
large contribution to the heat transfer whereas the contribution of the photon
emission and absorption process is negligible. This near-ﬁeld heat transfer be-
tween nanoparticles is analogous to the energy transfer between molecules due
to the dipole-dipole coupling known as F¨orster transfer [96]. It may also be
resonant for surface plasmon resonances. In what follows, we shall derive ex-
plicitly the heat transfer between nanoparticles and the emission by a surface
plane.

7.1 Radiative power exchanged between two spherical nanoparticles

We now calculate the heat transfer between two spherical nanoparticles held
at diﬀerent temperature and separated in the vacuum. Such a calculation was
ﬁrst reported by Volokitin and Persson [83]. Let us consider two nanoparticles
whose dielectric constant are ǫ1 and ǫ2 and whose temperatures are T1 and T2.
We ﬁrst calculate the power dissipated in particle 2 by the electromagnetic
ﬁeld induced by particle 1 using the dipolar appoximation:

P1→2(ω) = ǫ0

where r2 denotes the position of the particule 2 and α2 is the polarisability of
a sphere of radius a [97]:

.

The ﬁeld incident on the particle 2 created by the thermal ﬂuctuating dipole
of particle 1 located at r1 at temperature T1 is given by:

Einc(r2, ω) = µ0ω2

tain the heat exchange between two spherical nanoparticles at temperature T1
and T2:

Let us note the 1/r6 spatial dependance of the heat transfer. This dependence
is typical of the dipole-dipole interaction. It is actually a van der Waals type
interactions that can be interpreted in the following way: ﬂuctuations (thermal
or not) distort the charge distribution of a nanoparticle producing a ﬂuctuating
dipole. This ﬂuctuating dipole induces in turn an electromagnetic ﬁeld on the
other nanoparticle initiating a second dipole. This dipole interaction causes
both an energy transfer and a momentum transfer or force. For molecules
this energy transfer is known as F¨orster transfer and the force is called van
der Waals force. We ﬁnd that nanoparticles follow a similar behaviour with a
resonance at the surface polariton resonance. Indeed, in the case of spherical
particle with radius a, the polarisability has a resonance when the dielectric
constant approaches
2 provided that the imaginary part of the dielectric
constant is not too high. The particle resonances appear in the visible part of
the spectrum for metals and in the infrared for polar materials.

7.2 Thermal emitted ﬂux by a planar interface

In this section, we analyse the emission by a plane interface. Let us consider
the situation of a planar interface (z = 0) separating a dielectric (z < 0) at
temperature T from a vacuum (z > 0). We shall derive the ﬂux emitted from
the interface.

7.2.1 Classical theory of radiation.

In the classical theory of radiation, the power d2Q emitted by an elementary
opaque surface dS at temperature T , in a solid angle dΩ around a direction u
making an angle θ with the normal to the surface (Fig.15), whose monochro-
matic emissivity is ǫ′(θ) is

7.2.2 Fluctuational electrodynamics method

We will follow Polder and van Hove [79] to show that the phenomenologi-
cal form of the emitted ﬂux can be derived in the framework of ﬂuctuational
electrodynamics. In the following sections, we use this approach to derive the
expressions valid in the near ﬁeld. Let us consider the situation of a planar
interface (z = 0) separating a dielectric (z < 0) at temperature T from a
vacuum (z > 0). The ﬂux emitted by the half-space is given by the Poynting
H. In the case of monochromatic quantities, the time aver-
vector S = E
age Poynting vector reads S(r, ω) = 1
H∗(r, ω)). This quantity
can be derived using the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Thus, the electric
and magnetic Green’s tensor are needed. In this geometry, these tensors are
given by (A.3) and (A.4). The Poynting vector reduces to its z component
Sz(r, ω)
]. In order to obtain the Poynting vec-

7.3 Heat transfer between two semi-inﬁnite polar materials. Interference ef-

fects

We now focus on the heat transfer between two semi-inﬁnite half-spaces sep-
arated by a vacuum gap and whose temperature T1 and T2 are uniform. The
main changes that occur at small distance is the fact that evanescent waves
can contribute to the heat transfer through tunneling.

We summarize in the next sections the results. Detailed derivations can be
found in [85] for instance. The radiative transfer is characterised by the radia-

propagating waves contribution to the radiative ﬂux between two semi-inﬁnite
media is very close to the usual one. Only the denominators are diﬀerent be-
cause interferences are not taken into account in the phenomenological model.

Contrary to the single interface case, this contribution does not vanish because
of the existence of both upward and downward evanescent waves in the space
between the two media[98]. When the distance reduces, this term is more
and more important due to the presence of the exponential e−2Im(γ3)d. When
the material involved are supporting surface waves, the imaginary part of the
reﬂection coeﬃcient in p-polarisation becomes important around the resonant
frequency, when the dielectric constant approaches -1. If the two media are
suﬃciently close to allow the interaction between the exponentially decaying
surface waves bound to each interface, a transfer occurs due to the tunneling
of evanescent waves.

Fig. 18. Monochromatic heat transfer coeﬃcient for a distance d = 10 nm and a
temperature T = 300 K. From [85]

Let us deﬁne a radiative heat transfer coeﬃcient as the limit of the ratio of
the radiative ﬂux on the temperature diﬀerence between the two media when
this temperature tends to zero:

hR(ω) = lim

(92)

In Fig.17, hR(ω) is represented versus the distance between two semi-inﬁnite
media of glass or SiC. For a distance larger than the thermal radiation wave-
length given by the Wien law, i.e. for d > 10 µm, the transfer does not depend
on the distance. We are then in the classical regime where the transfer occurs
through the radiation of propagating waves. At shorter distances, the transfer
increases as 1/d2. For a distance of 10 nm, the radiative heat transfer coeﬃ-
cient has increased by 4 orders of magnitude compared to its far ﬁeld value.
If we now focus on the spectral dependance of the heat transfer coeﬃcient
at a 10 nm distance (Fig.18), we note that the heat transfer is important for
the frequencies corresponding to resonant surface waves. The heat transfer
is therefore practically monochromatic in the near ﬁeld. We can also expand

44

asymptotically the radiative heat transfer coeﬃcient for short distances:

This expression yields the 1/d2 dependance of the transfer coeﬃcient and
its strong frequency dependance. Indeed, when the dielectric constant ap-
proaches -1, the radiative heat transfer coeﬃcient exhibits a peak as well as
the Fresnel reﬂection factor. This is the signature of the presence of a surface
wave. The validity of the 1/d2 dependence has been questionned in [86] on
the basis that an inﬁnite ﬂux is not physical. As a matter of fact, the ﬂux is
inﬁnite if one assumes that the temperature diﬀerence is kept constant. This
problem is analogous to the problem of an electron ﬂux or intensity that goes
to inﬁnity if the resistance goes to zero at ﬁxed voltage. This raises another
question: in the case of heat transfer, the resistance across a vacuum gap on
the order of 10 nm usually remains much larger than the bulk conduction
resistance of solids over distances on the order of 100 nm. It is thus safe to
assume that the temperature is uniform in the bulk over a skin depth so that
the calculation is valid.

7.4 Calculation of the heat transfer between a dielectric sphere and a half-

space

7.4.1 Introduction

We calculate in this part the radiative power exchanged between a small spher-
ical particle and a semi-inﬁnite medium. To this aim, we ﬁrst calculate the
power absorbed by the dielectric sphere placed above a heated half-space. We
then calculate the power dissipated by the half-space situated below a heated
sphere from reciprocity [94]. The geometry of the problem is presented in
Fig.19 : the upper medium z > 0 is vacuum. A particle (P ) of radius a and
dielectric constant ǫP (ω) = ǫ′
P (ω) is held at temperature TP . The
lower medium is ﬁlled by a homogeneous, isotropic material (bulk) of dielec-
tric constant ǫB(ω) = ǫ′
B(ω) + iǫ
B(ω) and held at temperature TB. The center
of the particle is at a distance d above the interface.

From this expression, we see that there is an enhancement of the power ab-
sorbed if the denominators vanish or approach zero. We have seen that it is
the case if the material support resonant surface waves so that the dielectric
constant of the material can take negative values. We study in the next section
the case of SiC.

As it has been said in the ﬁrst part of the article, SiC is a polar material that
can be described by an oscillator model (22). In Fig.20, we plot P B→P
(ω) for
a spherical particle held at temperature TP = 300 K, of radius a = 5 nm at
diﬀerent distances above the surface. We note that the ﬁgure displays two re-
1014
markable peaks at frequency ω1 ≈

rad.s−1. These two peaks correspond to the resonances of the system. The
ﬁrst one corresponds to a frequency where ǫP (ω) approaches -2 : a volume
phonon polariton is excited in the particle inducing a large electric dipole
and a large dissipation. The second one is related to the resonant surface
wave corresponding to a large increase of the electromagnetic LDOS. Thus,
here too, the radiative heat transfer in the near ﬁeld can be considered as
monochromatic. The electromagnetic waves associated with the resonant sur-

face waves are evanescent. The energy transfer, which ﬁnds its origin in the
presence of these waves, is important because the particle lies in the region
(up to many micrometers) where the evanescent ﬁeld is large, so that there
is an eﬃcient coupling between the ﬁeld and the particle. In the far-ﬁeld,
evanescent waves are negligible and usual results are retrieved. Fig.21 shows
the integrated power absorbed by the same particle versus the distance d. The
near-ﬁeld radiative heat transfer increases as 1/d3 (as it was suggested by the
asymptotic behavior) and is larger at small distances by several orders of mag-
nitude than the far ﬁeld one. This enhancement comes from the contribution
of evanescent waves. Reciprocity requires that the same enhanced radiative

heat transfer appears when the particle illuminates the surface. This situation
may help to understand the radiative heat exchange between a nano-tip (like
those used in near-ﬁeld microscopy) and a sample. To answer this question, we
calculated from (95) the total power (integrated over frequencies) dissipated
per unit volume for diﬀerent points in the sample. Fig.22 displays a map, in
log-scale, of the dissipation rate in the case of a 10nm-diameter sphere of SiC at
TP = 300 K situated 100 nm above a sample of SiC. It is seen that the energy
is dissipated on a scale comparable to the tip-sample distance. The dissipation
per unit volume decreases very fast (1/r6) with the distance r between the
source and the point of the sample where the dissipation is considered (the
isocontour labeled with a ’6’ corresponds to the points where the dissipation
per unit volume is 106 W m−3. The amount of energy locally deposited is as
large as 100 MW m−3. We note that the dependance of the heat deposited
follows the same regime as in the two particles exchange in the vacuum. This
is not surprising. Here also the phenomenon is due to an interaction between
induced dipoles. This phenomenon is also at the origin of the force between
macroscopic bodies at nanometric distances which is the subject of the next
section.

8 Role of surface electromagnetic waves on the Casimir force

8.1 Introduction

After having considered the energy exchange due to the interaction in the
near ﬁeld between surface waves, it is natural to wonder what happens in
terms of momentum exchange in the near ﬁeld when two semi-inﬁnite bodies
are approached face to face. This situation is actually well known since 1948,
when Casimir [99,100] ﬁrst showed the existence of an attracting force between

two parallel perfect conductors. A large body of litterature has been devoted
to this eﬀect and several reviews are available [101,102,103,104,105,106]. The
seminal paper of Lifshitz [107] occupies a special place because it was the
ﬁrst calculation of this force by means of the FDT for the currents. Agarwal
[108] reported a similar calculation using the FDT for the ﬁelds. There has
been an increasing interest in the Casimir force since it has been shown that
this force could be measured with high accuracy [109,110,111,112,113,114] and
that it should be considered in the design of micro electromechanical systems
(MEMS) [115,116]. Various correction to this force have been studied such as
ﬁnite conductivity [117] or temperature corrections [118,119]. In what follows,
we discuss the role of surface waves in the Casimir force. We will show that
they play a key role in the short distance regime.

To get a simple picture of Casimir force, we recall that a system of two plane
parallel reﬂecting planes is a waveguide. The number of electromagnetic modes
in the waveguide is discrete and depends on the thickness of the waveguide.
From quantum electrodynamics, it is known that each mode with frequency ω
has a minimum energy ~ω/2 refered to as vacuum ﬂuctuations. If the thickness
decreases, the number of modes decreases so that the electromagnetic energy
decreases. Hence, the existence of vacuum ﬂuctuations entails that there is an
attractive force between the two plates. This phenomenon is clearly a macro-
scopic manifestation of the electromagnetic energy of the vacuum which is a
pure quantum eﬀect. Yet, its computation amounts to count the number of
electromagnetic modes available and this is a pure classical problem. As has
been discussed in the previous sections, the local density of electromagnetic
states is completely dominated by the existence of surface modes. It follows
that the role of surface waves is essential in the physics of the Casimir force
in the short distance regime.

49

In classical electrodynamics, the momentum transfer is given by the Maxwell
stress tensor Tij [34]. The ﬁelds can be derived using the FDT [120]. Using
the system Green tensors for the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld, it is possible
to obtain this quantity. In the case of two semi-inﬁnite bodies separated along
the z axis by a vacuum gap, the momentum ﬂux reduces to the zz component

One has to substract the inﬁnite contribution to the force in the absence
of bodies [121]. The force can be attractive or repulsive depending on the
materials properties [122,123]. One obtains an attractive force in the case of
dielectrics [124] and a force that might be repulsive in some conﬁgurations
implying magnetic materials [125,126].

vacuum-medium interface. We use he convention that an attractive force cor-
responds to F < 0. The force appears as the contribution of elementary plane
waves which angular frequency is ω and which wavevector parallel to the inter-
face is uω/c. In his paper, Lifshitz used a deformation contour in the complex
plane of frequencies to obtain a ﬁnal formula where the summation over the
wavevector is replaced by an integral over v and the summation over the fre-
quencies is replaced by an integral over the imaginary frequencies ω = iξ.
This approach has the advantage to replace the oscillating exponentials with
smooth real functions that make the integral easy to integrate numerically.
Nevertheless, by doing such a deformation contour, one is losing the spectral
information contained in the expression (99). What we are going to show in
the following is that the main contribution to the force in the near ﬁeld is
coming from the coupled polaritons of both interfaces. Therefore, we will see
that there is a complete analogy in the interpretation of the momentum ex-

50

change with the interpretation of the energy exchange in terms of interaction
of surface-polaritons.

Let us study then the force spectrum in the case of two real materials. In
the case of SiC (Fig.23), the force is dominated by the UV and IR contribu-
tions. Actually, due to the presence of the ω3 in the expression (99), the UV
contribution is much more important than the IR one.

Fig.24 represents the force spectrum between two aluminum half-spaces. It
is seen that all the contributions are coming from frequencies very close to
plasmon-polariton resonances. From expression (99), it is easy to separate the
1) and the
polarisation contributions, the propagative contribution (0
evanescent one (u > 1). We see in Figs.23,24 that the peaks exist only in p-
polarisation and for evanescent waves. This fact is an additional argument in
favor of an interpretation of the force being caused by the interaction between
polaritons which are not propagating and only appear in p-polarisation. An
interpretation of the phenomenon is the following. At frequencies close to the
system resonances i.e. close to the surface waves frequencies, the density of
electromagnetic states increases. Thus, the amount of momentum carried in
the gap increases too 1 . This interpretation is only valid at distances of the
order of the wavelength of the surface wave. At larger distances, the force is
dominated by the propagative contribution as the original perfect conductors

situation ﬁrst pointed out by Casimir. We note also that the contribution to
the force at such small distances has a diﬀerent sign whether the frequency is
lower or higher than the resonant frequency. However, the total Casimir force
between dielectrics is always positive and smaller than the one for perfect
conductors.

8.3 Binding and antibinding resonances

The role of SPP can be further analysed by studying the variation of the
integrand of the force F (u, ω) in the plane (u, ω). Close to the resonant surface-
wave frequency ωSW , the contributions to the force come from evanescent
waves. We therefore limit our study to the case u > 1 and close to ω
∼
ωSW . In Fig.25a, we plot the integrand F (u, ω) for two aluminum half-spaces
separated by a distance d = 10 nm. Two branches mainly contribute, the
higher frequency branch yielding a repulsive contribution whereas the lower
one gives an attractive contribution. These two branches actually follow the
two-interfaces system dispersion relation given by

minima can be attributed to very large values of the reﬂection factor of a plane
interface rp. Thus, the dark line is the dispersion relation of a single SPP on
a ﬂat interface. In Fig.26, the integrand is plotted for two aluminum half-
spaces separated by a distance d = 100 nm : the two branches tend to merge
with the ﬂat interface dispersion relation. One can thus propose the following
interpretation : when the surfaces approach each other, the overlapping of
the two SPP leads to two coupled modes and to a splitting of the polaritons
frequencies [127,128]. The frequency splitting can be found from the solutions
of (100) which are implicitely deﬁned by

rp(u, ω) =

eωvd/c.

The signs correspond to either symmetric or antisymmetric mode functions
(for the magnetic ﬁeld), as sketched in the inset of Fig.26. The symmet-
ric (antisymmetric) branch corresponds to a lower (higher) resonance fre-
quency, respectively, similar to molecular orbitals and tunneling doublets.
These branches contribute with opposite signs to the Casimir force, due to

the attractive or repulsive character of its contribution to the Casimir force.

correction in γ/Ω is 2.5% of the zeroth order value of the force. The plot also
shows that for numerical integration, the tabulated data[46] and the Lorentz-
Drude model (102) with parameters ﬁtted around the surface resonance give
very close results over a large range of distances. This is another indication
that the short range Casimir force is dominated by a narrow frequency range.

8.5 Friction forces

The Casimir force that has been treated in the previous section is not the only
one that occurs when two bodies are approached one to each other. A particle
moving in a vacuum experiences a friction force proportional to its velocity
as ﬁrst discussed by Einstein [102,129,130,131,132]. Again, the friction force
arises from the ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. A major diﬀerence be-
tween friction forces and Casimir force is that the leading contributions come
from the low frequencies for friction. By contrast, high frequencies contribu-
tion gives the largest contribution to vacuum energy and therefore gives the
leading contribution to the Casimir force. The friction force has been studied
recently for a particle in close proximity to an interface. This force has been
used to develop a near ﬁeld imagery technique called shear-force microscopy
[133,134,135]. The exact origin of these forces is still unclear. Recently, ex-
periments on shear force [136,137] have been conducted in ultra-high vacuum

56

in order to eliminate forces due to a water monolayer for instance. Diﬀer-
ent models have been developped to explain the origin of the friction force
between two parallel surfaces [40,138,139,140,141] in the framework of ﬂuc-
tuational electrodynamic ﬁelds. The case of a particle moving parallel to a
surface has been considered in [142,143,144]. The friction force for particles
moving perpendicular to the surface has also been considered experimentally
[145] and theoretically [146]. Volokitin and Persson [147,148] have shown that
the friction force is much larger for the perpendicular case. The problem is still
open because the discrepancy between theory and experiments is very large.
Recently, it has been proposed [149] that the friction observed in the experi-
ment by Stipe et al. could be due to the dielectric located below the gold ﬁlm.
Volokitin and Persson [147] have suggested that adsorbates might produce a
very large enhancement of the friction forces. Clearly, more experiments are
needed to clarify this issue.

9 Concluding remarks

Many years after the discovery of surface polaritons, new discoveries and ef-
fects are still being reported. A major reason is the development of near-ﬁeld
techniques that allows to probe the properties of surfaces with a nanometric
resolution and motivates further work. Although thermal excitation of surface
waves had been studied in the past, their major role in many phenomena has
been realized only recently. It has been shown that heat transfer is dramat-
ically enhanced in the near ﬁeld due to the resonant contribution of surface
waves. It has been shown that the electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted by a thermal
source may be partially temporally coherent and partially spatially coherent
in the near ﬁeld. It has also been shown that the far ﬁeld emission properties of
surfaces can be engineered by exciting and coupling eﬃciently surface waves.
Partially spatially coherent thermal sources have been realized. Applications
to emitting light devices are under study. The role of surface excitations in the
Casimir force has been clariﬁed and the agreement between experiments and
models is now satisfactory. The situation for friction forces is far less clear.
There are still large discrepancies between published data and models.

A.2 Green’s tensor above an interface

For the plane interface system, it is convenient to use the representation due
to Sipe [45] that consists in a decomposition over elementary plane waves. We
use again the dyadic notation for the tensors. For instance, the s-component
of the electric ﬁeld is given by ˆsˆsE = ˆs(ˆs
E). In the case of a Green tensor
relating currents in the lower half space (r′ in medium 2) to a ﬁeld in the
upper half space (r in medium 1), one has:

A.3 Green’s tensor for a two-interfaces system

(A.8)

We now consider a two layers system. The upper medium is denoted 1 and lies
above z = d. The lower medium (z < 0) is medium 2. Medium 3 is deﬁned by
d > z > 0. The Green’s tensor relating the currents in medium 2 to the ﬁeld
in medium 1 with a ﬁlm of medium 3 between media 1 and 2 are given by:

multiple reﬂections.

B Fluctuation-dissipation theorem

In this section, we derive the apropriate spectral density for an absorption
measurement and for a quantum counter measurement. The operator needed
to describe the absorption of a photon involves the normally ordered correla-
tion function of the ﬁeld operator < E(−)
l > where E(+/−) is deﬁned using
only the positive or negative frequencies of the spectrum. We quote from [31]
the cross-spectral density of the normally and antinormally ordered electric
ﬁelds:

k E(+)

(N )
kl (r, r′, ω) = η(
(A)
kl (r, r′, ω) = η(ω)µ0~ω2[1 + coth(~ω/2kBT )]Im[GEE

−

kl (r, r′, ω)],

(B.2)

E

where η(ω) is the Heaviside function. It is seen that the normally ordered cross-
spectral density involves only negative frequencies whereas the antinormally
ordered correlation involves only positive frequencies. They can be viewed as
an analytic signal. Despite the apparent symmetry of the above equations,
there is a critical diﬀerence as will be seen in the next subsection.

B.2 Quantum counter measurement

We derive now the time correlation starting from the antinormally ordered
correlation function. This choice is apropriate for a quantum counter exper-
iment. The Casimir eﬀect that depends on the total energy of the system
pertains to this category. From [31], we have

We conclude by noting that both results have a similar structure and can be
described by an eﬀective spectrum deﬁned for positive frequencies only. This
analysis provides a justiﬁcation for the heuristic argument often used to drop
the vacuum energy ﬂuctuation.

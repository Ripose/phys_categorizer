We present a statistical description of the propagation of short pulses in long

optical ﬁbers, taking into account the Kerr and nonlocal nonlinearities on

an equal footing. We use the Wigner approach on the modiﬁed nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation to obtain a wave kinetic equation and a nonlinear dis-

persion relation. The latter exhibit that the optical pulse decoherence reduces

the growth rate of the modulational instability, and thereby contribute to the

nonlinear stability of the pulses in long optical ﬁbers. It is also found that the

interaction between spectral broadening and nonlocality tends to extend the

instability region.

The nonlinear propagation of pulses in optical ﬁbers has attracted a great deal of interest

since the early seventies1,2, and research into the application and theory of this ﬁeld is still

growing3. The evolution of coherent weakly nonlinear optical pulse envelopes is given by

the cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (CNLSE)1,3 involving the Kerr nonlinearity. The

CNLSE admits bright, dark and gray solitons, which are used for ultrahigh-speed optical

communications without pulse broadening and spectral dilution4. Even so, it has become

clear that the eﬀects of noise in ﬁbers and ampliﬁers could alter the pulse properties in

signiﬁcant ways. Thus, it is of crucial importance to obtain qualitative and quantitative

estimates of the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of incoherent perturbations5,6 on the optical pulse

propagation. Recently, the Wigner transform technique7,8 in nonlinear dispersive media has

been used to analyze Landau-like damping9,10, partially coherent higher order dispersive

eﬀects11, the importance of the incoherence spectrum12, and the inﬂuence of incoherence on

the modulational instability13,14 for cases involving the cubic Kerr nonlinearity.

However, there are other important nonlinearities15,16,17 (e.g. saturation and higher order

nonlocal nonlinearities) which can compete with the cubic nonlinearity in optical ﬁbers. The

combined inﬂuence of the cubic and nonlocal nonlinearities on the modulational instability of

a constant amplitude coherent optical pulse has been examined by Shukla and Rasmussen17.

In this Letter, we present a statistical description of partially incoherent pulses in long optical

ﬁbers, taking into account the Kerr and nonlocal nonlinearities on an equal footing. We use

the Wigner approach and deduce a wave kinetic equation from which a nonlinear dispersion

relation (NDR) has been derived. The NDR is then analyzed to demonstrate the eﬀect of

random noise on the modulational instability of incoherent optical pulses. It is found that

2

the optical pulse decoherency can contribute to the nonlinear stability of pulses in optical

ﬁbers.

Given the electric ﬁeld E(z, t) exp(ik0z

iω0t) of the optical pulses, the evolution the

where we have introduced the parameters α =

and and χ0 = χ(ω0) represents losses in the medium.

In order to take the eﬀects of partial coherence into account, we deﬁne the space-time

correlation function for the electric ﬁeld as C(z+, z−, t+, t−) = E∗(z+, t+)E(z−, t−), where

z± = z

of short partially coherent optical pulses in nonlinear media.

In order to analyse the modulational instability and the eﬀects of the terms due to a

nonzero γ, we make the ansatz F (z, t, ω) = F0(ω) + F1(ω) exp(iKz

short-pulse eﬀects, we will for simplicity neglect the loss term Γ in Eq. (4), in order to obtain

clearly interpretable results.1 Expanding Eq. (4) in terms of this ansatz, and using Eq. (3),

we obtain

to a frequency shift of the background plane wave solution, and the NDR (5) gives17

In practice however, the wave envelope will always suﬀer perturbations due to various

noise sources, e.g. ﬁber and ampliﬁer noise. A noisy environment may cause the pulse ﬁeld

to attain a random component in its phase. Thus, if the phase ϕ(x) of the electric ﬁeld

varies stochastically, such that the ensemble average of the phase satisﬁes20,21

1 It should be stressed that in certain applications, the losses may not be small, and the Γ term should
under these circumstances be kept. As noted by Shukla and Rasmussen17 the eﬀect of the loss term is to
damp the pulse according to exp(

This solution generalizes the result (6) to the case of a random phase background envelope

ﬁeld. Equation (9) clearly shows that the width gives a nontrivial contribution to the NDR.

We note that when γ = 0, we may deﬁne the growth rate κ according to K =

and the width ΩT then gives rise to a Landau like damping from Eq. (9).

When γ is non-zero, the growth/damping behavior becomes considerably more complex,

with new instability regions. Letting f = γ2I 2

2αI0(β + γΩ0), and assuming

ΩT ≪

from Eq. (9). When α > 0, and 2αI0(β + γΩ0) > γ2I 2

0 + α2Ω2, we have f < 0. Denoting

the growth rate by κ =

Im(K), we obtain κ =

2iαΩT . Thus, as expected, the

coherence spread ΩT gives rise to a smaller growth rate for the modulational instability of

incoherent optical pulses. We note that this instability occurs also when γ = 0.

On the other hand, if α > 0, but 2αI0(β + γΩ0) < γ2I 2

0 + α2Ω2, or α < 0, so that f > 0,

a new novel eﬀect is present due to a nonzero γ. We have κ =

a short pulse in conjunction with a ﬁnite statistical spread ΩT could give rise to a shift in

the damping due to the decoherency of the pulse, which hence implies a shift also in the

growth rate. This eﬀect can be seen in Fig. 1, where we have plotted κ as given by the full

dispersion relation (9) for the frequency shift Ω0 = 0. We have used the rescaling I0 →

is the damping shifted, but the instability regions is also extended, and quite signiﬁcantly for

higher values of γ/(β√α). Since γ/(β√α)

commonly used in ﬁber-optics, the value of the normalized non-locality strength may become

large, as D can be designed to be very close to zero for certain wavelengths22. Thus, the

novel coupling between spectral broadening and nonlocality should be possible to measure

using a suitable setup.

To summarize, we have presented an investigation of the modulational instability of inco-

herent optical pulses in a nonlinear optical medium that contains the Kerr and higher order

nonlocal nonlinearities on an equal footing. By using the Wigner transform, we have derived

a wave kinetic equation for incoherent pulses from the generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger

equation. The wave kinetic equation is further exploited to obtain a nonlinear dispersion

relation, which exhibits new features of the modulational instability. We ﬁnd that the deco-

herence of the optical pulses reduce the modulational instability growth rate due to a spatial

damping caused by the broad optical pulse spectrum. However, the combined eﬀect of a

random phase and a non-local nonlinearity is to extend the instability region as compared

to the case of a monochromatic spectrum. Thus, the present result thus contribute to the

nonlinear stability of incoherent optical pulses in long optical ﬁbers.

zero. From the peaks of the curves downwards, we have used I0 = 0.5, and the full curve

represents ΩT = γ = 0, and shows the regular modulational instability growth rate. The

next curve (dashed) gives κ for ΩT = 0.1 and γ = 0, while the third (dashed-dotted) curve

uses ΩT = 0 and γ = 1, and the fourth (dashed-dotted) curve has ΩT = 0.1 and γ = 1. The

last two curves (dashed and dotted, respectively), where ΩT = 0.1, γ = 1.9, and ΩT = 0,

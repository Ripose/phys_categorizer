Abstract

The oblique incidence of a Bessel beam on a dielectric slab with re-
fractive index n1 surrounded by a medium of a refractive index n > n1
may be studied simply by expanding the Bessel beam into a set of plane
waves forming the same angle θ0 with the axis of the beam. In the present
paper we examine a Bessel beam that impinges at oblique incidence onto
a layer in such a way that each plane-wave component impinges with an
angle larger than the critical angle.

The propagation of a Bessel beam, or Bessel wave[1], represents an inter-
esting topic both for its implication in relation to superluminal motion[2, 3],
and for its spatial localization, which makes it a good candidate for all practical
applications where a localized ﬁeld is required[4, 5].

The propagation of a Bessel beam through a dielectric slab, for normal in-
cidence and in the presence of total reﬂection, has already been analyzed by
Shaarawi and Besieris[6] and Mugnai[7]. Furthermore , propagation in a lay-
ered medium for normal and oblique incidences, in the absence of total reﬂection,
has also been studied[8].

The aim of the present work is to analyze a Bessel beam impinging onto a
plane slab at oblique incidence, in the case in which all the waves forming the
beam are in total reﬂection. The main interest of this kind of analysis is to
investigate if the beam propagates by maintaining its characteristic of localized
wave also in the case of oblique incidence.

Let us consider a simple system formed by two half-spaces that are ﬁlled with
a homogeneous and non-dispersive medium of refractive index n, and separated

The reference system S, of unit vectors i, j, k, is shown together with the
system S′, rotated of an angle Ω with respect to S. The vector s′ represents
the direction of propagation of a single plane wave. The contribution of all the
plane waves, making the same angle θ0 with the z′ axis, generates a Bessel beam
characterized by the axicon angle θ0 and whose axis of symmetry is coincident
with z′. The angle φ′ is the azimuthal angle in the plane x′y′.

by a gap, of thickness d, ﬁlled with a medium of refractive index n1 < n (see
Fig. 1). We refer the space to a system, S, of Cartesian coordinates x, y, z (unit
vector i, j, k), with the xy plane coinciding with the input boundary of the layer,
and the k axis normal to the boundaries. Let us consider a monochromatic plane
wave, impinging onto the layer, which can be written as[9]

ui = Ai exp[ik0n(αx + βy + γz)] exp(−iωt) ,

(1)

where Ai is the amplitude at the origin O, k0 = ω/c (ω is the angular frequency
of the wave), and α, β, γ are the directions cosines. Without loss of generality,
from here on, we shall omit the temporal factor and we assume Ai = 1.

In Refs.

[10] and [11] it has been shown that, within the same reference
system, the transmitted ut and the reﬂected ur plane waves can be expressed
as

ut = T exp[ik0n(αx + βy + γ(z − d)]
ur = R exp[ik0n(αx + βy − γz)] ,

The quantity T represents the complex amplitude of the transmitted wave at
O′, and R that of the reﬂected wave at O. Note that both T and R depend only
on γ and not on α and β.

The above expressions hold when the angle of incidence i onto the layer
is larger than the critical angle i0: this implies that sin i > n1/n, or, since
cos i = γ, that γ2 < 1 − (n2

1/n2) and Γ is real.

Let us now consider a set of plane waves, of the type given in Eq. (1), having
the same complex amplitude at O and whose directions of propagation form the
same angle θ0 with the axis k.

As usual, we can write the direction cosines as

α = sin θ0 cos φ
β = sin θ0 sin φ
γ = cos θ0 ,

where φ is the azimuthal angle in xy plane. The superposition of all these waves
creates a Bessel beam, UB, whose axis, kb, is normal to the boundaries of the
layer (kb ≡ k)[7],

U i

B = J0(k0nρ sin θ0) exp(ik0n cos θ0z) ,

where ρ represents the cylindrical coordinate in the plane normal to the axis
of the beam (ρ2 = x2 + y2). The Bessel beam is, therefore, expressed as an
expansion in plane waves, the directions of propagation of which cover a con-
ical surface of half angle θ0 (axicon angle). Thus, since each plane wave im-
pinges onto the layer with the same incidence angle θ0, the refraction angle
θ′ (sin θ′ = n sin θ0/n1) will also be the same for all the waves. Consequently,
the transmitted plane waves turn out to have the same complex amplitude at
O′, and the transmitted beam is found to be[7, 6]

U t

B = T J0(k0nρ sin θ0) exp[ik0n(z − d) cos θ0] .

(9)

Analogously, the reﬂected plane waves turn out to have the same complex am-
plitude at O, and their integration over φ constitutes the reﬂected Bessel beam:

U r

B = RJ0(k0nρ sin θ0) exp(−ik0nz cos θ0) .
Let us consider now the case of oblique incidence, that is when kb =k′ 6=
In this case, it is expedient to introduce another reference system, S′,
k[8].
whose axis k′ is rotated in the xz-plane of a given angle Ω with respect to k
(see Fig. 1). The Cartesian axes i′, j′, k′ of S′ are related to i, j, k by

where αk = sin Ω, γk = cos Ω.

The incident Bessel beam now consists of a set of plane waves, all forming the
same angle θ0 with k′. This implies that the plane-wave component impinges
onto the ﬁrst interface of the slab with diﬀerent angles of incidence. It turns
out that the incidence angle varies from θ0 − Ω to θ0 + Ω when φ ranges from
0 to 2π.

The generic incidence vector s′ can be written as

with

where φ′ is the azimuthal angle in plane x′y′. Thus, the incidence ﬁeld due to
a generic wave at a given point P of the space is given by

Figure 2: Phases and amplitudes of the reﬂection, Rob, and transmission, Tob,
coeﬃcients, as a function of the azimuthal angle φ′. Parameter values are:
ω = 60 rad/s, n = 1.5, n1 = 1, Ω ≃ 18◦ (αk = 0.3), θ0 = 60◦, d = 2 cm. For this
value of θ0, Ω = 18◦ represents the limit angle of rotation: for higher values of
Ω, not all the waves forming the beam are in total reﬂection.

For the reﬂected ur

The reﬂection Rob and transmission Tob coeﬃcients can be still expressed by
means of Eqs. (4) and (5), with γ replaced by γφ′ everywhere. Consequently,
Tob and Rob depend on φ′ as well:

The amplitudes |Tφ′| and |Rφ′ | and phases φT and φR, of Tob and Rob,
respectively, are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of φ′, for θ0 = 60◦, n1 = 1, n = 1.5
and Ω ≃ 18◦ (αk = 0.3). With this choice of parameter values, all the waves
forming the beam are in total reﬂection since the incidence angle of each wave
−1(1/n) = 41.8◦. For θ0 = 60◦, the

reﬂection at the ﬁrst interface.

In order to ﬁnd the reﬂected and transmitted beams, we have to integrate
Eqs. (17) and (18) over φ′, between 0 and 2π. In Figs. 3 and 4, we show the
results of the numerical integration for both the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁelds
as a function of the x coordinate, for θ0 = 60◦ and for normal (Ω = 0) and
oblique incidences (Ω ≃ 6◦, 11◦, 18◦, αk = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, respectively). We note
that, for Ω 6= 0, the transmitted ﬁeld is still characterized by a main maximum
and secondary maxima and minima , but suﬀers deformation with respect to
the incident ﬁeld and tends to lose its localization[12].

(dashed line), and oblique incidences, Ω ≃ 6◦, 11◦, 18◦ (αk = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
respectively). The reﬂected ﬁeld is derived, for y = 0 and z = 0, by numerical
integration of Eq. (17) over φ′, between 0 and 2π. Other parameter values are
as in Fig. 2. The displacement of the ﬁeld proﬁle, with respect to the normal
incidence, evidences the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect.

Looking at Figs. 3 and 4, we note that, for the same value of Ω, the reﬂected

ﬁeld suﬀers less deformation with respect to the transmitted one.

The deformation of the emerging Bessel beam (Fig. 4), with respect to
the incident one, can be followed by analyzing the ﬁeld inside the slab (optical
tunneling region). To this end, let us start again with a single plane wave. We
recall that, in the absence of the second half-space (d = ∞), the propagation
after the ﬁrst surface is due to evanescent waves which propagate parallel to the
slab. The presence of the second boundary at z = d originates anti-evanescent
(or regressive) waves, and the superposition of the two waves, as is well-known,
makes the Poynting vector diﬀerent from zero also in the direction perpendicular
to the slab.

The progressive u+ and regressive u− waves within the slab can be written

a decreasing of a factor 5, by varying d from 1 to 2, while it does not suﬀer
appreciable modiﬁcation in its shape.

Again, in order to derive the total Bessel beam we have to integrate the total
ﬁeld (25) over φ′, from 0 to 2π. The amplitude of the Bessel beam inside the
gap, at z = d/2 and y = 0, is shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the x coordinate,
for three diﬀerent values of the incidence angle Ω. We note that, for oblique
incidence, the Bessel beam starts to lose its characteristic property of localized
wave in the passage through the slab. In Fig. 6, we show the behavior of the
transmitted ﬁeld as a function of the x coordinate, for three diﬀerent values
of the slab’s thickness. We note that the dependence on d produces a strong
variation in the amplitude value, with no appreciable eﬀect in the shape of the
ﬁeld: the maxima and minima positions remain unchanged. The same behavior
holds also for the reﬂected and internal ﬁelds, with the only diﬀerence lying in
the fact that the variation in the amplitude is inappreciable for the reﬂected
ﬁeld, while the amplitude is halved in the ﬁeld inside the slab.

The numerical analysis was performed for an axicon angle of 60◦ in order to
have a clearer evidence of the delocalization eﬀect due to the passage through
the slab. For smaller axicon angles, the incidence angle must also be smaller
in order to have total reﬂection, and the eﬀect of deformation due to oblique
incidence is very poor.

An interesting aspect, related to the subject treated here, is the analysis of
the wavefronts of the beam inside the slab, in order to have informations about
the direction of propagation and the phase velocity in the tunneling region. This
kind of analysis, however, is beyond the scope of the present work and will be
reported elsewhere.

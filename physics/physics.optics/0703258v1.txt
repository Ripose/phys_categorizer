Abstract

The quantum Zeno eﬀect and electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) phenomenon are the results of a speciﬁc population transfer in a
three level systems. They are based on the inequality of forward and re-
versed processes. However, a more simple two level systems better suit
now for experimental study of this fundamental property in optics.

PACS number: 33.80.Rv, 42.50.Hz

The concept of quantum Zeno eﬀect (paradox) was introduced by Misra
and Sudarshan in 1977 [1]. It is usually deﬁned as ”the inhibition of transitions
between quantum states by frequent measurements” [2]. There is also somewhat
miraculous, supernatural deﬁnition: ”It describes the situation that an unstable
particle, if observed continuously, will never decay” [3]. Probably, such mystical
component makes this phenomenon so famous now.

Later it was introduced the opposite phenomenon of the anti-Zeno eﬀect
[4, 5]. As the example of such phenomena the EIT eﬀect can, probably, be
discussed [6]. However, in this case the authors turn out to be not so supersti-
tious and conﬁne themselves to description of the phenomenon by the concept
of the so-called dark state polariton [7]. This is the standard situation in the
nonlinear optics, when the theorists substitute a task of physical explanation of
a phenomenon for its mathematical description. The Bloch, Gross-Pitaevskii,
Schrodinger and other equations are usually used for this purpose.

The goal of this note is to point out that the physical base of the quantum
Zeno eﬀect and EIT phenomenon is the population transfer in a three level
systems. The main problem here is that we do not understand and we can not
explain the physical mechanism of population transfer in such systems. And
what is more, we can not explain the physical mechanism of population transfer
in the simplest two level systems. We can only describe this process using the
Bloch equations in the framework of the rotating wave approximation model [8].
But the Bloch equations do not have clear physical sense. So, a mathematical
description can not replace a physical explanation. In the absence of knowledge
the superstition appears.

For explanation of the physical mechanism of population transfer (for exam-
ple in the case of the sweeping of resonance conditions) we should recognize the
concept of inequality of forward and reversed processes in optics [9]. Unfortu-
nately, the scientiﬁc community does not ready now to accept this idea. How-
ever, the ignoring of the inequality concept is rather foolish position, because

of any alternative explanation of the physical origin of nonlinear phenomena in
optics is practically absent. The concept of coherency or coherent states can
not play such role. It is rather indistinct, vague and itself does not have reliable
physical base [10, 11]. Even in a greater degree such conclusion relates to the
concept of the entanglement [12].

In contrast, the concept of inequality of forward and reversed processes gives
such explanation.
It is simple and concrete. It has experimental proofs and
allows further experimental veriﬁcations. The most important task now is the
comparative study of the parameters of forward and reversed transitions in
simple two level systems [13, 14]. The study of mechanism and dynamics of
population transfer in three level and more complex systems is a premature
task now. And using the concept of the ”quantum Zeno eﬀect” for explanation
of the results of such experiments is the unfounded way [15]. It leads only to
increasing entropy in the scientist’s heads.

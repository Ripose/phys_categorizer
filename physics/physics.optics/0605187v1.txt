We use a variational approach to ﬁnd a one-dimensional potential energy function that yields
the largest hyperpolarizability, which we ﬁnd is within 30% of the fundamental limit. Our results
reveal insights into the character of the potential energy functions and wavefunctions that lead to
the largest hyperpolarizability. We suggest that donor-acceptor molecules with a conjugated bridge
with many sites of broken conjugation may be the best paradigm for making materials with huge
hyperpolarizabilities that approach the fundamental limit.

The

optical materials has
study of nonlinear
for making the largest
been driven by the quest
response in a medium for use
possible nonlinear
in a broad range of optical applications
such as
telecommunications,[1] optical data storage,[2] three-
dimensional nano-photolithography,[3, 4] and making
new materials[5] for novel cancer therapies.[6]

A natural questions arises whether there is a limit to
the nonlinear response and if so, how does one make a
molecule to get to the limit. The former has been an-
swered in the aﬃrmative[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] but the latter
has been elusive. In fact, the largest nonlinear suscepti-
bilities of the best molecules fall short of the fundamental
limit by a factor of 103/2.[11, 13, 14] A Sum-Over-States
(SOS) calculation of the hyperpolarizability[15] using the
analytical wavefunctions of the clipped harmonic oscil-
lator yields a value that is within a factor of 2 of the
limit.[13] Thus, the factor-of-thirty gap between the fun-
damental limit and the apparent upper bound of the best
molecules is not of a fundamental nature. So, it should
be possible in principle to make materials with second-
order susceptibilities that are a factor of 30 bigger than
the currently best materials. In this letter, we report on
the character of the potential energy function of a one-
dimensional system that yields a hyperpolarizability, β,
that is within 30% of the fundamental limit, and use this
potential to propose a new paradigm for molecular engi-
neering.

There are two equivalent expressions for β. The stan-
dard one, βSOS, as calculated by Orr and Ward,[15] and
the dipole-free expression, βDF .[16] The standard one
is overspeciﬁed in the sense that it is possible to pick
unphysical values of the energies and matrix elements,
which violate the precepts of quantum mechanics. The
dipole free expression, in contrast, is simpliﬁed into a re-
duced form that contains no dipole terms. Since the two
expressions should yield the same results if all the matrix
elements are consistent with the sum rules, deviations be-
tween them can be used as a convergence test.[16] How-
ever, we later discuss how to treat exceptions where βDF
is accurate and βSOS is not.

Our approach is to numerically calculate β for a spe-
ciﬁc potential, then, to use an optimization algorithm

that continuously varies the potential in a way that max-
imizes β - using the convergence test to determine if
the result is reliable. Our code is written in MATLAB.
For each trial potential we use a quadratic ﬁnite element
method [17] to approximate the Schr¨odinger eigenvalue
problem and the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method [18]
to compute the wave functions and energy levels. To op-
timize β we use the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm [19].
Figure 1a shows the evolution of the hyperpolariz-
ability as a function of the number of iterations of the
optimization algorithm, applied to βDF . All hyperpo-
larizabilities are normalized to the fundamental limit.
The initial potential energy function is a hyperbolic tan-
gent with inﬁnite potential at the boundaries. We se-
lect this potential because it is localized near the origin,
yet ﬂat elsewhere, allowing the optimization process to
work without any initial biases. After 7,000 iterations,
the algorithm converges to just over βDF /βMAX = 0.72,
the largest hyperpolarizability seen to date. No other
starting potential, including polynomials, and fractional
exponents, leads to larger βDF .

As a second convergence test, we use the fractional
deviation from the ground state sum rule, which in terms

of κ00 as deﬁned in the literature, is given by,[20]

where En0 is the energy diﬀerence between state n and
0, xnm is the position matrix element between state n
and m, and xmax
is the fundamental limit of x10. τ00 ap-
proaches zero when the optimization process yields max-
imum βDF , supporting the fact that the numerical com-
putations accurately represent the system. When, on the
other hand, βSOS is optimized, τ00 is large and the two
forms of β diverge appreciably, illustrating the robustness
of the dipole-free form and the pitfalls of using βSOS for
optimization. Our calculations of β include a total of 15
states, so a large value of τ00 is more of an indication
that not enough states are being used in βSOS rather
than inaccuracies of the wave functions. The fact that
βSOS and βDF do not converge illustrates the need for
two independent convergence tests.

Figure 1b shows the evolution of the position matrix
elements. When βDF is small, many of these matrix ele-
ments are non-negligible, so many states will contribute
to β. By a thousand iterations when the hyperpolariz-
ability approaches its largest value, all matrix elements
vanish except for two of them. This clearly shows that
as the fundamental limit of β is approached, the system
collapses to a three-level model for β. This is consistent
with the three-level ansatz, previously proposed, that a
three-level model describes a system with a hyperpolar-
izability at the fundamental limit.[21] There is mount-
ing evidence that the three-level ansatz also is obeyed in
planar molecules.[22] We stress that our results do not
prove the converse; that all molecules with hyperpolar-
izabilities at the fundamental limit must be represented
by a three-level model. However, since (1) the three-
level ansatz is used to determine the fundamental limits,
and, all reliable measurements and calculations yield hy-
perpolarizabilities below the fundamental limit; and (2)
numerical optimization yields a three-level model, this
form of induction provides strong support for the ansatz.
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the potential energy
function. Optimization of the hyperpolarizability clearly
favors a potential with large oscillations. Interestingly,
all starting potentials, independent of their initial form,
develop such wild oscillations of about the same period
when the hyperpolarizability is maximized. Figure 3
shows, from the spectrum of eigenfunctions as a func-
tion of iteration, that these oscillations serve to localize
each eigenfunction at diﬀerent positions. Early in the op-
timization process, the wavefunctions are all delocalized
while at 7,000 iterations, most of the wavefunctions are
mutually non-overlapping.

Figure 4 shows the eigenfunctions and potential energy
function after 7,000 iterations. Only excited states num-
ber 1 and 6 have appreciable overlap with the ground
state and with each other. Furthermore, while some of
the states, like number 11 and 12, overlap each other,

they do not overlap with the ground state. As such, the
only term that contributes to the hyperpolarizability is
proportional to x01x16x60/E10E60.

10

Under the three-level ansatz, the normalized hyperpo-
larizability can be expressed as a product of two func-
tions, β/βMAX = f (E)G(X),[13] where X = x10/xMAX
and E = E10/E20. “1” and “2” label the states with
the largest transition moments to the ground state. The
function f (E) is maximum when E = 0 (f (0) = 1) and
G(X) is maximum when X = −4√3 (G( −4√3) = 1). So,
a hyperpolarizability that approaches the fundamental
limit should have two dominant states that have well
separated eigenenergies; and, x10 = −4√3xMAX
. The op-
timized wavefunctions yield E = 0.314 and X = 0.775,
so f (E) = 0.892 and G(X) = 0.999. The transition
moment is near optimal but the energy level spacing
can be improved.
If the system were truly 3 levels,
β/βMAX = f (E)G(X) = 0.89 compared with the op-
timized value of βDF /βMAX = 0.72.

10

One might argue that our results are artiﬁcial because
we are using only 15 states, and, because our space is
bounded by an inﬁnite potential at x = 0 and x = 20.
These two issues go hand in hand. In our calculations,
the potential energy function is represented by a cubic
spline of 20 points. As such, it would be numerically im-
possible to localize more than about 15 eigenfunctions.
Furthermore, higher-energy wavefunctions would inter-
act with the walls; and, for high-enough energies, the
wavefunctions would have the character of a particle in
a box. So, to increase the number of energy levels, one
would need to increase the number of points in the spline,
which would lead to more oscillations that would localize
more of the excited states. Based on the pattern that we
have observed, when increasing the number of states and
making the potential correspondingly broader, we expect

3

that more non-overlapping wavefunctions would develop,
yielding a similar conclusion. So, in the limit of inﬁnitely
wide space, the conclusion should be the same.

In conclusion, we have applied an optimization pro-
cess to determine what potential energy function yields
the largest value of the hyperpolarizability. As a func-
tion of iteration, the hyperpolarizability approaches the
fundamental limit, but never exceeds it. When β con-
verges to the maximal value, the expression for β col-
lapses to a three-level model, supporting the three-level
ansatz. Strong oscillations in the potential energy func-
tion serve to isolate the wavefunctions to prevent overlap
between all states but three of them. This behavior sug-
gests that long linear organic molecules with regions of
conjugation (representing the dips in the potential) bro-
ken by many non-conjugated regions (representing the
peaks) and ﬂanked by a donor and acceptor to break the
symmetry, would be a promising new paradigm. Or, our
method could guide the fabrication of multiple quantum
well structures using a variety of organic molecules that
impart to it an oscillating potential energy proﬁle.

We plan to apply our general method to higher-order
nonlinear-optical susceptibilities. In addition, it can be
applied to resonant processes and to any general com-
binations of laser wavelengths. With regards to the sec-
ond hyperpolarizability, γ, since past calculations suggest
that the three-level ansatz also should hold, we would ex-
pect the same sort of conclusion. Should this approach
be successful, new and exceptional materials could be
developed to make more eﬃcient devices and novel ap-
plications.

Abstract

Optical tweezers are widely used for the manipulation of cells and their internal structures.
However, the degree of manipulation possible is limited by poor control over the orientation of
trapped cells. We show that it is possible to controllably align or rotate disc shaped cells—chloroplasts
of Spinacia oleracea—in a plane polarised Gaussian beam trap, using optical torques resulting predom-
inantly from circular polarisation induced in the transmitted beam by the non-spherical shape of the
cells.

Introduction

Optical tweezers are widely used for the manipulation of cells and their internal structures [1]. A
strongly focussed laser beam is used to apply piconewton forces, which is sufﬁcient to trap or to
move cells in three dimensions. However, there is poor control of the orientation of cells within the
trap. While a variety of methods to rotate microscopic objects have been demonstrated, they are either
dependent on absorption [2, 3], making them unsuitable for biological applications, restricted to special
types of particles [4, 5, 6], or make use of multiple beams or special types of beams [7, 8, 9]. The
latter methods can, in principle, be used for the rotation of biological specimens, but either add a great
deal of complexity to the required apparatus, or use expanded non-symmetric focal spots, reducing the
possibility of three-dimensional trapping.
The alignment of elongated dielectric particles within static ﬁelds suggests that it might be possible to
align non-spherical trapped objects simply by using a plane polarised trapping beam. Unlike rod shaped
objects, which tend to align along the beam axis [10] leaving no remaining asymmetry with respect to
the plane of polarisation, disc shaped objects, aligned with the beam axis, retain an asymmetric shape
perpendicular to the beam axis and should also align with the plane of polarisation. Such an alignment
scheme has the dual advantages of being easy to implement using an existing optical tweezers apparatus,
and providing maximum trapping efﬁciency. The torques acting to align a dielectric object within a
static ﬁeld result from the induced polarisation within the object being at an angle to the applied ﬁeld. It
would, however, be questionable to na¨ıvely apply the static ﬁeld results to trapping by optical ﬁelds.
We demonstrate experimentally that sufﬁcient torque is generated for the technique to be useful
for biological specimens—chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea in our experiments—and calculate the

Bayoudhetal. Orientationofbiologicalcells

optical force and torque using a full electromagnetic wave solution of Maxwell’s equation to show
unambiguously that the torque can be accounted for by the non-spherical shape of the chloroplasts.

2 Observation of alignment of chloroplasts

A standard optical tweezers setup using an inverted microscope was used. The only modiﬁcation
required for the alignment experiments was the addition of a half-wave plate on a rotatable mount to
control the direction of the plane of polarisation (see ﬁgure 1). A Nd–YAG laser at 1064 nm was used,
focussed by a 100× oil-immersion object of numerical aperture 1.3 to produce the trap.

Figure 1: Schematic diagram of optical tweezers system for alignment of biological cells. The apparatus
is a conventional optical tweezers setup with the addition of a half-wave plate in a rotatable mounting,
allowing the plane of polarisation of the initially plane polarised trapping beam to be rotated.

Chloroplasts were isolated from fresh spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea L.) using a buffer solution
containing 0.4 M sucrose, 0.05 M HEPES, 0.01 M KCl, 0.0001 M MgCl2 with a pH of 7.8. Chloroplasts
were three-dimensionally trapped in the buffer solution using a beam power of 30 mW at the specimen
plane. Trapped chloroplasts were observed to align with the plane of polarisation of the trapping beam.
As the plane of polarisation of the trapping beam was rotated, the chloroplasts rotated so as to re-align

Bayoudhetal. Orientationofbiologicalcells

with the beam, taking on the order of a second or two to do so. Alignment of a chloroplast is shown in
ﬁgure 2.

Figure 2: Alignment of chloroplasts with the plane of polarisation of the trapping beam. The frames
show rotation of a chloroplast as the plane of polarisation of the trapping beam is rotated. In each frame,
the chloroplast lies in the plane of polarisation. The chloroplast is approximately 4 µm long along the
long axis.

Since the observed alignment is similar to that expected from birefringent particles [5], it necessary to
exclude this possibility. This was done by replacing the half-wave plate with a quarter wave plate to
produce a circularly polarised trapping beam. If the chloroplasts were sufﬁciently birefringent so as to
align with the plane polarised beam, the circularly polarised beam should have caused them to rotate at
a constant rate [5]. Chloroplasts were not observed to rotate or align in the circularly polarised beam.
No birefringence could be detected when viewing chloroplasts between crossed polarisers.

3 Optical force and torque

Optical forces and torque are a necessary result of the conservation of momentum and angular
momentum when a particle scatters light, changing the momentum or angular momentum. Therefore,
if the scattering of the trapping beam by the trapped cell can be calculated, the optical force and torque
can be calculated [11].
The chloroplasts that we wish to model scattering by are too large for the Rayleigh (ie small particle)
approximation to be valid, and too thin for the geometric optics approximation to be valid. Therefore,
a full EM wave scattering calculation is needed. We calculate the scattered ﬁelds using the T-matrix
method [12, 13, 14, 15], in which, as in generalised Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT) [16], the incident and
scattered ﬁelds are expanded in terms of vector spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs), which are the electric
and magnetic multipole ﬁelds. Unlike GLMT, the T-matrix method does not require the surface of the
particle to be a constant surface in a separable coordinate system.
Apart from being computationally well-suited for optical tweezers calculations since the T-matrix for a
given particle needs to be calculated only once [11, 15], the mathematical formulation of the T-matrix
method is physically enlightening since the VSWFs are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the total angular
momentum operator, with eigenvalues [n(n + 1)]1/2, and the z-component of angular momentum
operator, with eigenvalues m.
In our T-matrix calculations, the incoming and outgoing ﬁelds are expanded in terms of incoming and
outgoing VSWFs:

our division of the ﬁelds into a purely incoming incident ﬁeld and an outgoing scattered ﬁeld is unusual;
it is much more common to include the outgoing ﬁeld resulting from the incident ﬁeld in the absence
of a scatterer as part of the incident ﬁeld. Both formulations are equivalent [18]; our choice simpliﬁes
the expressions for optical force and torque. In practice, the ﬁeld expansions and the T-matrix must
be terminated at some ﬁnite n = Nmax chosen so that the numerical results converge with sufﬁcient
accuracy [18, 19].

The expansion coefﬁcients of the outgoing (ie scattered) ﬁeld are found from the expansion coefﬁcients
of the incoming ﬁeld using the T-matrix:

where a and p are vectors formed from the expansion coefﬁcients of the incident wave (anm and bnm)
and the scattered wave (pnm and qnm). The expansion coefﬁcients of the incoming ﬁeld are calculated
using far-ﬁeld point-matching [19], and the T-matrix is calculated using a row-by-row point-matching
method, exploiting symmetry of the particle when possible [18].

4 Optical force and torque on trapped chloroplasts

We model chloroplasts as oblate spheroids. Our numerical results are calculated for a spheroid of aspect
ratio 4, with semi-minor axis of 0.5 µm and semi-major axes 2.0 µm. This is typical of the size and
aspect ratio of the chloroplasts aligned in our experiment.
In reality, one face of the chloroplasts is
concave [21], but our simpliﬁed geometry serves as a general model for disc shaped cells and organelles,
and adequately models the almost disc shaped chloroplasts. At the trapping wavelength of 1064 nm,
the refractive index of the chloroplast is assumed to be 1.4, which is typical of organelles such as
mitochondria and nuclei as well as chloroplasts. Therefore, the results for chloroplasts, including both
experimental observations and theoretical caclulations, are also applicable to other organelles of similar
size and shape. The refractive index of the sucrose solution in which the chloroplasts are trapped is 1.35.
The trapping beam was chosen to reproduce the focal spot size in the trap. The focal spot is elliptical,
with radii of 0.60 µm and 0.54 µm along and perpendicular to the plane of polarisation, respectively. The
ellipticity of the beam spot is a consequence of strongly focussing a plane polarised vector beam [19, 24].
The axial trapping efﬁciency is shown in ﬁgure 3. The equilibrium position of the chloroplast in the
observed orientation (aligned with the plane of polarisation) is with its centre 1.20 µm beyond the beam
focus. Since the chloroplasts are three-dimensionally trapped during the course of the experiment,
torques are evaluated when the chloroplast is at this equilibrium position within the trap.

Figure 3: Axial trapping efﬁciency. The trapping efﬁciency is shown for an oblate spheroidal chloroplast
with semi-minor axis 0.5 µm and semi-major axes 2 µm. The trapping efﬁciency is shown for chloroplasts
aligned along the beam axis, at varying angles to the plane of polarisation. The force is shown for
chloroplasts aligned with the plane of polarisation (solid line), at 45◦ to (dashed line), and perpendicular
to the plane of polarisation (dotted line). The equilibrium position in all cases is with the centre of the
chloroplast slightly beyond the focal plane of the beam located at z = 0.

The torques acting to align the plane of the chloroplast with the beam axis and the plane of polarisation
are shown in ﬁgure 4. The torque acting to align the chloroplast with the beam axis depends on the axis
about which the chloroplast rotates. However, this torque is always much larger than the torque aligning

the chloroplast with the plane of polarisation. Noting that the drag torque acting on the chloroplast will
be on the order of the drag torque that would act on a sphere of radius equal to the semi-major axis of the
chloroplast, we can estimate that the drag torque will be of order τdrag = 8πµa3Ω = DΩ where µ is the
dynamic viscosity of the medium (≈ 10−3 Nsm−2 for water, and ≈ 1.48 × 10−3 Nsm−2 for the sucrose
solution in our experiments), a is the semi-major axis of the chloroplast, and Ω is the rotation rate of the
chloroplast. For the chloroplast considered here, the drag coefﬁcient D ≈ 0.3 pNµms/rad. For the beam
power used in our experiments, 30 mW, the mean torque acting to align the chloroplast with the beam
axis is about 3.8 pNµm, giving a mean rotation speed of ≈ 13 rad/s, so the chloroplasts can be expected
to take on the order of a tenth of a second, or less depending on the initial position, to align with the
beam axis. The torque acting to align the chloroplast with the plane of polarisation is much smaller, with
a mean value of 0.22 pNµm, giving a mean rotation speed of ≈ 0.73 rad/s, and an alignment time on the
order of 2 s. This is consistent with observations made during the experiment.

Figure 4: Alignment torque on chloroplasts. The torque is shown for alignment with the beam axis
with the axis of rotation (a) perpendicular to the plane of polarisation and (b) parallel to the plane of
polarisation, and (c) for alignment with the plane of polarisation by rotation about the beam axis after the
chloroplast has aligned with the beam axis. The angle is the angle between the plane of the chloroplast
and the beam axis/plane of polarisation.

The numerical results agree well with the observed behaviour of the chloroplasts, allowing us to
unambiguously identify the non-spherical shape of the chloroplasts as the cause of their alignment with
the plane of polarisation of the beam. The spin and orbital contributions to the alignment torque are
shown in ﬁgure 5. The spin torque is approximately 23 times larger than the orbital torque, for all angles
between the plane of the chloroplast and the plane of polarisation for which the torque is non-zero.
Therefore, the torque is predominantly due to circular polarisation of the transmitted light resulting
from scattering by the chloroplast.
The polarisation of the transmitted light is affected by the scattering process due to the differing dielectric
polarisability of the chloroplast parallel to its long and short axes [22]. This results in a phase difference
between the plane-polarised components in the transmitted beam parallel to the long and short axes of

the chloroplast, which generally produces an elliptically polarised transmitted beam. This is similar to
the action of a birefringent particle, and this effect is termed form birefringence or shape birefringence [23].
The small orbital torque is due to the interaction between the elliptical focal spot of the beam and the
shape of the chloroplast. The ellipticity of the focal spot results when a plane-polarised beam of circular
cross-section is focussed to a diffraction-limited spot [19, 24].
The dependence of the torque on the size and shape of an oblate spheroid is shown in ﬁgure 6. Since
the difference in polarisability of the spheroid along the long and short axes increases with increasing
aspect ratio, the torque increases as the aspect ratio increases. For small particles, the torque increases as
the particle size increases, because the optical thickness and therefore the phase shift between the plane-
polarised components parallel to the long and short axes, and the particle intercepts more of the beam
as its cross-sectional area increases. Once the particle becomes larger than the beam, the illuminated
portion of the particle is approximately rotationally symmetric about the beam axis, and the torque
becomes smaller with increasing particle size. The largest possible torque is generated when the particle
is as large as possible, while retaining maximum rotational asymmetry of the illuminated portion of the
particle. This occurs when the semi-minor axis is approximately equal to the beam waist radius.
Similar alignment effects can be expected for other types of non-spherical particles in optical traps;
alignment of short rods has been recently reported [25]. Since the alignment torque due to non-spherical
shape is relatively small compared to the torque that can be obtained by using birefringent particles, it
might not be observed in all cases; for example, Cheng et al. recently trapped thin PMMA disks, but
failed to observe alignment [26].

5 Conclusion

We have demonstrated that the non-spherical shape of chloroplasts is sufﬁcient to allow controllable
alignment with optical tweezers using a single plane-polarised Gaussian beam. The chloroplast aligns
with one long axis along the beam axis, and the other long axis in the plane of polarisation of the
beam. Since the plane of polarisation of the trapping beam can be rotated using a half-wave plate, the
orientation of the chloroplast can be controlled. This method of alignment can be applied to other non-
spherical objects that have two long axes. Since the diffraction-limited focal spot of a strongly focussed
plane polarised beam is slightly elliptical in shape, the focal spot shape might contribute somewhat to
the torque. However, our calculations show that the torque is predominantly due to circular polarisation
induced in the transmitted beam by the shape of the chloroplast.

Abstract

We report on a methodology for the evaluation of the DC characteristics, small-signal frequency

response and large-signal dynamic response of carrier and photon density responses in semicon-

ductor laser diodes. A single mode laser is considered and described with a pair of rate equations

containing a novel non-linear gain compensation term depending on a single parameter that can

be chosen arbitrarily. This approach can be applied to any type of solid-state laser as long as it is

described by a set of rate equations.

INTRODUCTION

Generally, lasers are described with a set of rate equations describing the generation-

recombination of carriers or emission-absorption of photons. The equations are typically

systems of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations belonging to the population evolution type.

In this report we specialize to the simple case of single-mode laser diode where the

system of equations reduces to two: one for the carrier population (density) and another for

the photon population (density). We concentrate on the case the equations embody a novel

non-linear gain compensation term that depends on a single parameter that can be chosen

arbitrarily. The eﬀect of this parameter is studied on the DC characteristics, small-signal

frequency response and large-signal dynamic response of the laser.

The Single Mode (SM) laser diode rate equations are written as:

− g(N − Nt)

(2)

N represents the electron density (Nt at transparency) and S the photon density. τn

is the electron spontaneous lifetime and τph is the photon lifetime. β is the fraction of

spontaneous emission coupled to the lasing mode, G the optical conﬁnement factor, g is the

diﬀerential gain and ǫ is the gain compression parameter. q is the electron charge, V the vol-

ume of the active region and I is the injection current which, in general, is a function of time.

The main novelty in these equations lie in the non-linear gain factor that has been

traditionally modelled by the term g(1 − ǫS), g/(1 + ǫS) or even g/

(1 + ǫS) [1]. In this

study, this term is taken to an arbitrary power [2] b in the interval [0,1.5]. In order to cover
in the simulation the case g(1 − ǫS), we formally allocate b=-1 to this case. We analyse

q

in this work the eﬀects b has on the static, small- signal frequency response as well as the

large-signal temporal variation of the carrier and photon densities.

This report is organized as follows:

in section 2 we outline the evaluation of the Laser
S − I (photon density versus injection current) DC characteristics. In section 3, the small-

2

signal frequency response is derived and in section 4, we illustrate the laser response to

time-dependent injection currents and section 5 contains our conclusions.

II. DC CHARACTERISTICS

The DC limit of the SM laser rate equations is given by:

From (4) we extract the value of (N − Nt) as:

(6)

This relation gives I as a function of S. Generating a series of data values (S, I) by

varying S and reverse writing them as (I, S) will result in the S − I DC characteristic.

We consider two laser models A and B (Physical parameters given in Appendix A) and

illustrate this procedure with the characteristics displayed in Figures 1 and 2 for diﬀerent

values of b. It appears from the ﬁgures that b does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the DC charac-

teristics in contrast with the frequency response and dynamic response as seen in the next

sections.

III. SMALL-SIGNAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE

In order to derive the small signal frequency response, we assume all quantities I, N and

S are taken around some equilibrium values I0, N0 and S0 and hence:

I = I0 + δI(t), N = N0 + δN(t), S = S0 + δS(t)

(7)

This means that equation (1) under variation (7) reads:

dδN

=

− δN

(1 + ǫS0)b

− g(N0 − Nt)[

(8)

whereas (2) becomes:

(1 + ǫS0)b + Γg(N0 − Nt)[

(1 + ǫS0)b

−

ǫS0b

(1 + ǫS0)b+1 ]δS (9)

In order to tackle the small-signal frequency response we switch to the time-harmonic case

where the time derivatives are given by: dδI/dt = jωδI, dδN/dt = jωδN, dδS/dt = jωδS.

This results in a system of equations relating the three variations δI, δN and δS:

δN(jω +

+ g

1
τn

S0
(1 + ǫS0)b ) =

δI
qV

− g(N0 − Nt)[

1
(1 + ǫS0)b

−

ǫS0b
(1 + ǫS0)b+1 ])

(10)

and:

δN(

(1 + ǫS0)b ) = δS(jω +

1
τph

− Γg(N0 − Nt)[

1
(1 + ǫS0)b

−

ǫS0b
(1 + ǫS0)b+1 ]

(11)

Taking the ratio of the above yields the small-signal frequency response:

where E, G and C are given by:

δS
δI

C + jωG − ω2

E =

It is displayed for laser A and B in Figures 3 and 4 for diﬀerent values of b.

In sharp contrast with the DC case, the value of b, has a drastic eﬀect on the frequency

response as observed in the above ﬁgures. We diﬀer from Way [4] in the frequency response

due to a discrepancy in the estimation of the resonance frequency. Way deﬁnes the resonance

frequency as (using our own notation and adapting it to Way’s [4] case):

fr =

1
(
2π s

ΓNtgτph + 1

)

(I/Ith − 1)

where I is the bias and Ith is the threshold current. Our corresponding formula by

inspection of (16) would be:

(18)

The dependence on the bias and threshold currents, in our case, is contained in N0 and

S0 that are found numerically with a Newton method [11] adapted to (5) and (6).

Obviously, Way’s estimation [4] of the resonance frequency is approximate by comparing

(17) and (18) since he wanted to get an analytical estimate of the resonance frequency. In

order to estimate the discrepancies between our work and Way’s we display in Figure 5 the

frequency response for various values of the bias current expressed in terms of the threshold
current Ith ∼21mA.

IV. LARGE-SIGNAL DYNAMIC RESPONSE

We exploit three possible excitation scheme for the injection current:

1. A step excitation in order to evaluate the step response of the laser.

2. A graded response with a Gaussian time excitation towards a higher injection level.

3. A modulation injection in order to estimate the modulation response of the laser for

large excursions of the injection current.

5

As an example we consider lasers A and B biased at t=0 and excited with an additional

square pulse triggered after 5 nanoseconds of operation. Figures 6-9 show the large signal

dynamic responses for the carrier and photon densities as functions of time for diﬀerent

values of b. As expected, the value of b deeply aﬀects the dynamic response of the Laser as

observed in the ﬁgures 6-9.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed an approach that evaluates the DC characteristics, small-signal

frequency response and large- signal dynamic responses of carrier and photon densities

in single-mode semiconductor laser diodes directly from the rate equations. The laser is

described with a pair of rate equations containing a novel non-linear gain compensation

term depending on a single parameter b that can be chosen arbitrarily in the range [0,1.5]

as has been shown recently with a microscopic calculation of plasma-heating induced

intensity-dependent gain eﬀects [2].

Our DC evaluations agree with several published results [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and our

large-signal dynamical reponses agree also with what is well established in the literature

[7]. We diﬀer with the small-signal frequency response results given by Way [4] due to a

discrepancy in the frequency response and resonance frequency estimation.

The parameter b has almost no eﬀect on the DC characteristics but deeply aﬀects the

small-signal frequency response as well as the large-signal dynamic response.

The methodology developed in this work can be easily generalised to an arbitrary number

of state equations that appear in multimode semiconductor lasers, MQW (Muli-Quantum-

Well) or Strained layer lasers [8, 9, 10].

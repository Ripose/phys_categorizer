We reelaborate on the basic properties of lossless multilayers by using bilinear transformations. We
study some interesting properties of the multilayer transfer function in the unit disk, showing that
hyperbolic geometry turns out to be an essential tool for understanding multilayer action. We use a
simple trace criterion to classify multilayers into three classes that represent rotations, translations,
or parallel displacements. Moreover, we show that these three actions can be decomposed as a
product of two reﬂections in hyperbolic lines. Therefore, we conclude that hyperbolic reﬂections
can be considered as the basic pieces for a deeper understanding of multilayer optics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Although special relativity is perhaps the ﬁrst theory
that comes to mind when speaking about the interplay
between physics and geometry, one cannot ignore that
geometrical ideas are essential tools in the development
of many branches of modern physics [1].

The optics of layered media is not an exception: in re-
cent years many concepts of geometrical nature have been
introduced to gain further insights into the behavior of
multilayers. The algebraic basis for these developments
is the fact that the transfer matrix associated with a loss-
less multilayer is an element of the group SU(1, 1), which
is locally isomorphic to the (2 + 1)-dimensional Lorentz
group SO(2, 1).This leads to a natural and complete iden-
tiﬁcation between reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients
and the parameters of the corresponding Lorentz trans-
formation [2, 3].

As soon as one realizes that SU(1, 1) is also the ba-
sic group of the hyperbolic geometry [4], it is tempt-
ing to look for an enriching geometrical interpretation
of the multilayer optics. Accordingly, we have recently
proposed [5, 6] to view the action of any lossless mul-
tilayer as a bilinear (or M¨obius) transformation on the
unit disk, obtained by stereographic projection of the
unit hyperboloid of SO(2, 1). This kind of representa-
tion has been previously discussed for, e.g., the Poincar´e
sphere in polarization optics [7, 8], for Gaussian beam
propagation [9], in laser mode-locking and optical pulse
transmission [10], and also in modelling visual process-
ing [11].

The point we wish to emphasize is that these bilin-
ear transformations preserve hyperbolic distance between
points on the unit disk. In Euclidean geometry any trans-
formation of the plane that preserves distance can be
written as a composition of reﬂections, which can be
then considered as the most basic transformations.
In
fact, the composition of two reﬂections in straight lines
is a rotation, or a translation, according these lines are
intersecting or parallel.

In hyperbolic geometry, each circle orthogonal to the

boundary of the unit disk is a hyperbolic line and reﬂec-
tions appear as inversions. However, we have an essential
diﬀerence with the Euclidean case because there are three
intersecting, parallel, and ultra-
diﬀerent kind of lines:
parallel (which are neither intersecting nor parallel) [4].
In consequence, the composition of two reﬂections in hy-
perbolic lines is now a rotation, a parallel displacement,
or a translation: these are precisely the transformations
of the unit disk that preserve distance.

A powerful way of characterizing transformations is
through the study of the points that they leave invari-
ant. For example, in Euclidean geometry a rotation can
be characterized by having only one ﬁxed point, while a
translation has no invariant point. For a reﬂection the
ﬁxed points consist of all the points of a line (the reﬂec-
tion axis).

In this paper we shall consider the ﬁxed points of
the bilinear transformation induced by the multilayer,
showing that they can be classiﬁed according to the
trace of the multilayer matrix. From this viewpoint,
the three transformations mentioned above; namely, ro-
tations, parallel displacements, and translations appear
linked to the fact that the trace of the multilayer transfer
matrix has a magnitude lesser, equal or greater than 2.
Since reﬂections appear as the basic building blocks
of these geometric motions [12], we show that any multi-
layer action can be decomposed in terms of two inversions
whose meaning is investigated. Such a decomposition is
worked out for practical examples. This shows the power
of the method and, at the same time, allows for a deeper
understanding of layered media.

II. MULTILAYERS AND THE UNIT DISK

We ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the essential ingredients of
multilayer optics we shall need for our purposes [7]. We
deal with a stratiﬁed structure, illustrated in Fig. 1, that
consists of a stack of 1, . . . , j, . . . , m, plane-parallel layers
sandwiched between two semi-inﬁnite ambient (a) and
substrate (s) media, which we shall assume to be iden-

(cid:21)

where the complex numbers Ras and Tas are, respec-
tively, the overall reﬂection and transmission coeﬃ-
cients for a wave incident from the ambient. Because
|Ras|2 + |Tas|2 = 1, we have the additional condition
|α|2 − |β|2 = 1 or, equivalently, det Mas = +1 and then
the set of lossless multilayer matrices reduces to the group
SU(1, 1), whose elements depend on three independent
real parameters.

The identity matrix corresponds to Tas = 1 and Ras =
0, so it represents an antireﬂection system. The matrix
that describes the overall system obtained by putting two
multilayers together is the product of the matrices repre-
senting each one of them, taken in the appropriate order.
So, two multilayers, which are inverse, when composed
give an antireﬂection system [14].

In Refs. [2] and [3] we have proposed to view the multi-
layer action in a relativisticlike framework. Without go-
ing into details, it is convenient to characterize the state
of the ﬁelds at each side of the multilayer by means of
the “space-time” coordinates

[|E(+)|2 + |E(−)|2],

E(−)],
[|E(+)|2 − |E(−)|2],

for both ambient and substrate media. The coordinate e3
is the semi-diﬀerence of the ﬂuxes (note that this number
can take any real value) and, therefore, is constant be-
cause the multilayer is lossless. In consequence, we have
that

(e0)2 − (e1)2 − (e2)2 = (e3)2 = constant.

(5)

Equation (5) deﬁnes a two-sheeted hyperboloid of radius
e3, which without loss of generality will be taken hence-
forth as unity [15].

A simple calculation shows that if one uses stereo-
graphic projection taking the south pole (−1, 0, 0) as pro-
jection center (see Fig. 2), the projection of the point
(e0, e1, e2) becomes in the complex plane

z =

e1 + ie2
1 + e0 =

E(−)
E(+) .

(6)

The upper sheet of the unit hyperboloid is projected into
the unit disk, the lower sheet into the external region,
while the inﬁnity goes to the boundary of the unit disk.
The geodesics in the hyperboloid are intersections with
the hyperboloid of planes passing through the origin.
Consequently, hyperbolic lines are obtained from these

We consider an incident monochromatic linearly polar-
ized plane wave from the ambient, which makes an angle
θ0 with the normal to the ﬁrst interface and has ampli-
tude E(+)
. The electric ﬁeld is either in the plane of
incidence (p polarization) or perpendicular to the plane
of incidence (s polarization). We consider as well another
plane wave of the same frequency and polarization, and
with amplitude E(−)
, incident from the substrate at the
s
same angle θ0 [13].

As a result of multiple reﬂections in all the interfaces,
we have a backward-traveling plane wave in the ambi-
ent, denoted E(−)
, and a forward-traveling plane wave
a
in the substrate, denoted E(+)
. If we consider the ﬁeld
amplitudes as a vector of the form

(cid:18)

which applies to both ambient and substrate media, then
the amplitudes at each side of the multilayer are related
by a 2×2 complex matrix Mas, we shall call the multilayer
transfer matrix, in the form

Ea = Mas Es .

This can be seen as arising from the usual Minkowski
distance in the unit hyperboloid (obtained through
geodesics) by stereographic projection [17]. The essential
point for our purposes here is that bilinear transforma-
tions are isometries; i.e., they preserve this distance.

III. TRACE CRITERION FOR THE
CLASSIFICATION OF MULTILAYERS

Bilinear transformations constitute an important tool
in many branches of physics. For example, in polarization
optics they have been employed for a simple classiﬁcation
of polarizing devices by means of the concept of eigen-
polarizations of the transfer function [7]. The equivalent
concept in multilayer optics can be stated as the ﬁeld
conﬁgurations such that za = zs ≡ zf in Eq. (7), that is

zf = Φ[Mas, zf ],

(10)

whose solutions are

zf =

−2i Im(α) ±

[Tr(Mas)]2 − 4

.

(11)

p

o

1
2β n

These values zf are known as ﬁxed points of the trans-
formation Φ. The trace of Mas provides then a suitable
tool for the classiﬁcation of multilayers [18].

When [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4 the multilayer action is elliptic
and it has only one ﬁxed point inside the unit disk, while
the other lies outside. Since in the Euclidean geometry
a rotation is characterized for having only one invariant
point, this multilayer action can be appropriately called
a hyperbolic rotation.

When [Tr(Mas)]2 > 4 the multilayer action is hyper-
bolic and it has two ﬁxed points both on the boundary
of the unit disk. The hyperbolic line joining these two
ﬁxed points remains invariant and thus, by analogy with
the Euclidean case, this action will be called a hyperbolic
translation.

Finally, when [Tr(Mas)]2 = 4 the multilayer action is
parabolic and it has only one (double) ﬁxed point on the
boundary of the unit disk. This action will be called a
parallel displacement.

To proceed further let us note that by taking the con-

jugate of Mas with any matrix C ∈ SU(1, 1); i.e.,

Mas = C Mas C−1,

since
we obtain another matrix of the same type,
Mas) = Tr(Mas). Conversely, if two multilayer ma-
Tr(
trices have the same trace, one can always ﬁnd a matrix
C satisfying Eq. (12).
The ﬁxed points of

Mas are then the image by C of the
ﬁxed points of Mas. In consequence, given any multilayer

as projection center.

by stereographic projection and they correspond to cir-
cle arcs that orthogonally cut the boundary of the unit
disk.

It seems natural to consider the complex variables in
Eq. (6) for both ambient and substrate. In consequence,
Eq. (2) deﬁnes a transformation on the complex plane C,
mapping the point zs into the point za according to

za = Φ[Mas, zs] =

β∗ + α∗zs
α + βzs

,

(7)

which is a bilinear (or M¨obius) transformation. The ac-
tion of the multilayer can be seen as a function za = f (zs)
that can be appropriately called the multilayer transfer
function [6]. The action of the inverse matrix M−1
as is
zs = Φ[M−1
as , za]. One can show that the unit disk, the
external region and the boundary remain invariant under
the multilayer action.

For later purposes, we need the concept of distance in
the unit disk. To this end, it is customary to deﬁne the
cross ratio of four distinct points zA, zB, zC , and zD as
the number

(zA, zB|zC, zD) =

(zA − zC)/(zB − zC )
(zA − zD)/(zB − zD)

,

(8)

which is real only when the four points lie on a circle or
a straight line. In fact, bilinear transformations preserve
this cross ratio [16].

Let now z and z′ be two points that are joined by the
hyperbolic line whose endpoints on the unit circle are
E and E′. The hyperbolic distance between z and z′ is

4

ensure that za will lie in the orbit associated to zs.

In the Euclidean plane any isometry is either a rota-
tion, a translation, or a reﬂection. In any case, reﬂections
are the ultimate building blocks, since any isometry can
be expressed as the composition of reﬂections. In this Eu-
clidean plane two distinct lines are either intersecting or
parallel. Accordingly, the composition of two reﬂections
in two intersecting lines forming an angle ϕ is a rotation
of angle 2ϕ while the composition of two reﬂections in
two parallel lines separated a distance d is a translation
of value 2d.

However, in the hyperbolic geometry induced in the
unit disk, any two distinct lines are either intersecting
(they cross in a point inside the unit disk), parallel (they
meet at inﬁnity; i.e., at a point on the boundary of the
unit disk), or ultraparallel (they have no common points).
A natural question arises: what is the composition of
reﬂections in these three diﬀerent kind of lines? To some
extent, the answer could be expected: the composition
is a rotation, a parallel displacement, or a translation,
respectively. However, to gain further insights one needs
to know how to deal with reﬂections in the unit disk.
This is precisely the goal of next Section.

IV. REFLECTIONS IN THE UNIT DISK

In the Euclidean plane given any straight line and a
point P which does not lie on the line, its reﬂected image
P ′ is such that the line is equidistant from P and P ′. In
other words, a reﬂection is a special kind of isometry in
which the invariant points consist of all the points on the
line.

The concept of hyperbolic reﬂection is completely anal-
ogous: given the hyperbolic line Γ and a point P , to ob-
tain its reﬂected image P ′ in Γ we must drop a hyperbolic
line Γ from P perpendicular to Γ (such a hyperbolic line
exists and it is unique) and extending an equal hyper-
bolic distance [according to (9)] on the opposite side of
Γ from P . In the unit disk, this corresponds precisely to
an inversion.

To maintain this paper as self-containd as possible, let
us ﬁrst recall some facts about the concept of inversion.
Let C be a circle with center w and radius R. An inver-
sion on the circle C maps the point z into the point z′
along the same radius in such a way that the product of
distances from the center w satisﬁes

boundary of the unit disk and fulﬁlls ww∗ = R2 + 1. In
consequence

For a general matrix Mas the corresponding orbits can

ﬁxed points of the multilayer matrix are known, one can

One can check [16] that inversion maps circles and lines
into circles and lines, and transforms angles into equal
angles (although reversing the orientation). If a circle C′
passes through the points P and P ′, inverse of P in the
circle C, then C and C′ are perpendicular. Moreover,
the hyperbolic distance (9) is invariant under inversions.
This conﬁrms that inversions are indeed reﬂections and
so they appear as the most basic isometries of the unit
disk.

It will probe useful to introduce the conjugate bilinear
transformation associated with a matrix Mas as [compare
with Eq. (7)]

To shed light on the physical meaning of the inver-
sion, assume that incoming and outgoing ﬁelds are inter-
changed in the basic conﬁguration shown in Fig. 1. In
our case, this is tantamount to reversing the time arrow.
It is well know that given a forward-traveling ﬁeld E(+),
the conjugate ﬁeld [E(+)]∗ represents a backward phase-
conjugate wave of the original ﬁeld [20]. In other words,
the time-reversal operation can be viewed in this context
as the transformation

z 7→

1
z∗ ,

(21)

for both ambient and substrate variables; that is, it can
be represented by an inversion in the unit circle. The
transformed points lie outside the unit circle because,
according to Eq. (4) this time reversal transforms the
upper sheet into the lower sheet of the hyperboloid.

Moreover, by direct inspection is easy to convince one-
self that the matrix relating these time-reversed ﬁelds is
precisely M∗
as and so the action can be put as

∗
(1/za)

=

β∗ + α∗(1/zs)∗
α + β(1/zs)∗ ,

(22)

which expresses a general property of the time-reversal
invariance in our model.

As we have anticipated at the end of Section III the
composition of two reﬂections gives a rotation, a parallel
displacement, or a translation, accordingly the two hy-
perbolic lines are intersecting, parallel, or ultraparallel,
respectively.

To illustrate how this geometrical scenario translates
into practice, we consider an optical system versatile
enough so as it could operate in the three regimes. To this
end, we choose a Fabry–Perot-like system formed by two
identical plates (each one of them with ﬁxed phase thick-
ness δ1) separated by a spacer of air with phase thickness
δ2. This is a symmetric system for which Ras and Tas
can be easily computed. By varying the spacer phase-
thickness δ2 we obtain the values of [Tr(Mas)]2 shown in
Fig. 4. In all the examples we take as initial condition
that in the substrate zs = 0.4 exp(−iπ/3).

First, we take δ2 = 3 rad, so we are in the elliptic
case ([Tr(Mas)]2 < 4). From the computed values of Ras
and Tas one easily obtains the value za = −0.4447 +
0.4882i. The ﬁxed point turns out to be zf = −0.3114
and, in consequence, the multilayer action is a hyperbolic
rotation around the center zf of angle 2ϕ, as indicated
in Fig. 5. This multilayer action can be viewed as the
composition of reﬂections in two hyperbolic lines Γ1 and
Γ2 intersecting at zf and forming an angle ϕ. The ﬁrst
inversion maps zs into the intermediate point zint, which
is mapped into za by the second inversion. Note that
there are inﬁnity pairs of lines satisfying these conditions,
but chosen arbitrarily one of them, the other is uniquely
determined. Moreover, once these lines are known, they
determine automatically the associated inversions.

Next, we take the spacer phase thickness δ2 = 1 rad,
which corresponds to the hyperbolic case ([Tr(Mas)]2 >
4), and we get za = 0.1567+0.4464i. The ﬁxed points are
zf 1 = −0.3695 − 0.9292i and zf 2 = −0.3695 + 0.9292i.

FIG. 7: Decomposition of the multilayer action in terms of
two reﬂections in two parallel lines for the same multilayer as
in Fig. 4 with δ2 = 0.4328 rad (parabolic case).

Finally, we take δ2 = 0.4328 rad, so we are in the
parabolic case ([Tr(Mas)]2 = 4), and za = −0.1615 +
0.6220i. The (double) ﬁxed point is zf = −1. In Fig.7
we have plotted the horocyle connecting zs and za and
the ﬁxed point. Now, we have the composition of two
reﬂections in two parallel lines Γ1 and Γ2 that intersect
at the ﬁxed point zf and with the same constraint (23)
as before.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have proved a geometric scenario to
deal with multilayer optics. More speciﬁcally, we have re-
duced the action any lossless multilayer (no matter how
complicated it might be) to a rotation, a parallel dis-
placement or a translation, according to the magnitude
of its trace. These are the basic isometries of the unit disk
and we have expressed them as the composition of two
reﬂections in intersecting, ultraparallel, or parallel lines.
There is no subsequent factorization in simpler terms so,
reﬂections are the most basic motions one can ﬁnd in the
unit disk.

We hope that this approach will complement the more
standard algebraic method in terms of transfer matrices,
and together they will aid to obtain a better physical and
geometrical feeling for the properties of multilayers.

Finally, we stress that the beneﬁt of this formulation
lies not in any inherent advantage in terms of eﬃciency in
solving problems in layered structures. Rather, we expect
that the formalism presented here could provide a general
and unifying tool to analyze multilayer performance in a
way closely related to other ﬁelds of physics, which seems
to be more than a curiosity.

two reﬂections in two intersecting lines for the same multilayer
as in Fig. 4 with δ2 = 3 rad (elliptic case).

FIG. 6: Decomposition of the multilayer action in terms of
two reﬂections in two ultraparallel lines for the same multi-
layer as in Fig. 4 with δ2 = 1 rad (hyperbolic case).

There are no invariant points in the unit disk, but the
hyperbolic line joining zf 1 and zf 2 is the axis of the
hyperbolic translation.
In Fig. 6, we have plotted the
hypercicle passing through za and zs. The multilayer
action can be now interpreted as the composition of two
reﬂections in two ultraparallel hyperbolic lines Γ1 and Γ2
orthogonal to the translation axis. If Γ1 and Γ2 intersect
the hypercicle at the points z1 and z2, they must fulﬁll

dH(za, zs) = 2dH(z1, z2),

(23)

in complete analogy with what happens in the Euclidean
plane. Once again, there are inﬁnity pairs of lines fulﬁll-
ing this condition.

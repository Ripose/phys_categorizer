We propose a novel way to trap and manipulate nano-objects above a dielectric substrate using
an apertureless near-ﬁeld probe. A combination of evanescent illumination and light scattering at
the probe apex is used to shape the optical ﬁeld into a localized, three dimensional optical trap. We
use the coupled-dipole method and the Maxwell stress tensor to provide a self-consistent description
of the optical force, including retardation and the inﬂuence of the substrate. We show that small
objects can be selectively captured and manipulated under realistic conditions.

Since the seminal work of Ashkin on radiation pres-
sure, the possibility to exploit the mechanical action of
optical ﬁelds to trap and manipulate neutral particles
has spawned a wide range of applications. From atomic
and nonlinear physics to biology, optical forces have pro-
vided a convenient way to control the dynamics of small
particles (see Ref.[1] for a review). Optical tweezers, for
example, have proved useful not only for trapping par-
ticles, but also for assembling objects ranging from mi-
crospheres to biological cells [2]. However, most of these
manipulations involve particles whose size is between one
and several micrometers. While for much smaller parti-
cles, such as atoms or molecules, the scanning tunneling
microscope provides a powerful tool for manipulation and
engineering [3], dealing with neutral particles of a few
nanometers requires new experimental approaches.

The idea of using a metallic probe to trap small parti-
cles was reported by Novotny et al [4]. Their calculations
showed that strong ﬁeld enhancement from light scat-
tering at a gold tip could generate a trapping potential
deep enough to overcome Brownian motion and capture a
nanometric particle in water (a related work by Okamoto
and Kawata demonstrates theoretically the trapping of a
nanometric sphere in water near an aperture probe [5]).
This technique should be delicate to implement in prac-
tice for three reasons. First, before the particle can be
captured, Brownian ﬂuctuations will have a disruptive
eﬀect. Second, radiation pressure from the illuminating
laser will impart momentum to the particle. Therefore,
one would have to capture a moving object. Finally, it
will be rather diﬃcult to use a near-ﬁeld probe to ﬁnd in
water a particle a few nanometers in size. One might wait
for a particle to wander in the trapping region, but such
an operating mode does not allow for selective capture.

In this letter, we propose an experimental scheme to
selectively capture and manipulate nanoparticles in vac-
uum or air above a substrate, using the tungsten probe
of an apertureless near-ﬁeld microscope. The particles
are not in a liquid environment, hence there is no Brow-

nian motion and the apertureless probe can be used as
a near-ﬁeld optical probe to localize and select the par-
ticles [6,7]. This is an important asset when diﬀerent
particles have to be placed according to a speciﬁc pat-
tern or when interactions between particles are investi-
gated. For example, with our conﬁguration quantum-dot
nanocrystals (CdSe/ZnS nanospheres a few nanometers
in diameter) could be placed in a speciﬁc geometry to
study dot-dot interactions, or one nanocrystal could be
isolated to study single-dot properties [8].

FIG. 1. Scheme of the conﬁguration. A dielectric sphere
(radius 10 nm) on a ﬂat dielectric surface is illuminated under
total internal reﬂection. A tungsten probe is used to create
an optical trap.

We ﬁrst consider a spherical particle with radius 10 nm
placed in air on a substrate (Fig. 1). Unless it is stated
otherwise the permittivity of both the particle and the

1

substrate is ǫ = 2.25. The particle is illuminated (wave-
length 500 nm) by two counter-propagating evanescent
waves created by the total internal reﬂection of plane
waves at the substrate/air interface (angle θ > θc = 41.8◦
with √ǫ sin θc = 1). These two waves have the same po-
larization and a random phase relation. [9] This symmet-
ric illumination ensures the lateral force vanishes when
the sphere is just below the tip, thus avoiding that the
sphere be pushed away from the tip.

We study the interactions between the particle and
a tungsten probe (commonly used in apertureless mi-
croscopy) with a radius at the apex of 10 nm. The
theory used to compute the optical forces has been pre-
sented in detail elsewhere [10]. Here we give a succinct
summary. We use the coupled-dipole method [11,12] to
model the light scattering and ﬁnd the electromagnetic
ﬁeld inside the tip and the particle. Note that this proce-
dure takes into account the multiple scattering between
the sphere, the tungsten tip, and the substrate. We then
use the Maxwell stress tensor technique to derive the op-
tical forces [13]. We emphasize that the stress tensor
approach is exact and does not rely on any assumption
regarding the nature of the ﬁeld (whether evanescent or
propagating) or of the objects.

All

forces are

computed for an irradiance of
0.05W/µm2 (this corresponds, for example, to a 5W laser
beam focused over an area of 100µm2). Figure 2 shows
the z component of the force experienced by the sphere
versus the vertical position of the tip above the sphere,
for both TE and TM polarizations and for two angles of
illumination (θ = 43◦ and θ = 50◦). As the tip moves
closer to the sphere, the evolution of the force for the two
polarizations is radically diﬀerent. For TM illumination
there is a large enhancement of the ﬁeld near the apex of
the probe because of the discontinuity of the z component
of the electric ﬁeld across the air/tungsten boundary [4].
This enhancement is responsible for the force being pos-
itive at short distances. Note that for the sphere, the

force of gravity is on the order of 10−7pN. The z compo-
nent of the force experienced by the sphere (when the tip
is in contact with the sphere) is about 3pN which is 108
times its weight. Hence, gravity can be neglected. Fig.
2a shows that for TM polarization the force is larger for
θ = 43◦ than for θ = 50◦. This is related to the slower
decay of the evanescent wave for the smaller angle, which
results in a weaker coupling between the sphere and the
substrate. Moreover, the slower the decay of the evanes-
cent ﬁeld, the larger the ﬁeld that reaches the tip, and the
larger the (positive) gradient force caused by the ﬁeld en-
hancement at the apex of the probe. As a consequence,
when the tip approaches the sphere, the sign reversal
(negative to positive) of the z component of the force oc-
curs at a larger distance for θ = 43◦ (z=21 nm) than for
θ = 50◦ (z=13 nm). This is shown in the inset of Fig.
2a. On the other hand, for TE polarization (Fig. 2b), the
magnitude of the z component of the force increases while
the force remains negative (directed toward the substrate
and away from the tip) as the tip gets closer to the par-
ticle. This prevents any trapping. Our calculations show
that this behavior is caused by the decrease of the ﬁeld
inside the upper part of the sphere which, in turn, causes
a decrease of the gradient force. Another way of explain-
ing this is to note that because the apex of the tip and
the sphere are small compared to the wavelength, they
can be approximated by two dipoles. For TE polariza-
tion these dipoles are essentially parallel to the substrate
and as shown in Ref.[14], two parallel dipoles tend to
repel each other. Since the magnitude of the dipole is
stronger for θ = 43◦ (due to the larger intensity of the
ﬁeld), the repulsive force is also stronger. Note that for
a silver tip at the plasmon resonance frequency, the force
acting on the sphere is positive for both polarizations.
At the frequency considered here, tungsten behaves like
an absorbing dielectric and the force is positive only for
TM polarization.

To fully assess the probe-particle coupling we study
the evolution of the force experienced by the particle as
the probe is moved laterally, the sphere remaining ﬁxed.
The components of the force acting on the sphere are
plotted in Figs. 3 and 4 for two distances between the
tip and the substrate (20 nm and 31 nm), and for two
angles of illumination (43◦ and 50◦). For TM polariza-
tion (Fig. 3a), the z component of the force is negative
when the tip is far from the particle. When the tip gets
closer, the particle starts experiencing a positive force
along z. The change of sign occurs between
x
=30 nm
|
|
for θ = 43◦ and z = 20 nm, and
=7 nm for θ = 50◦
and z =31 nm. For TE polarization the force is negative
(Fig. 3b). Similarly, we plot in Fig. 4 the lateral force.
The symmetry of the force plot is a consequence of the
symmetric illumination. For TM polarization (Fig. 4a)
this force tends to push the particle toward the tip. For
example, if the tip is located at x =10 nm, we can see in
Fig. 4a that the x component of the force experienced by
the sphere is positive, hence the lateral force pushes the
sphere toward the tip. If the tip is located at x =-10 nm,
the x component of the force is negative and, again, it
pushes the sphere toward the tip. Therefore, when the
tip and the particle are close enough for the z compo-
nent of the force to be positive and to lift the particle
oﬀ the surface, the lateral force actually helps bringing
the particle in the trap. Again TE polarization gives a
diﬀerent result. The lateral force always pushes the par-
ticle away from the tip. However, since the magnitude of
the (downward) z component of the force is larger than
the x component by a factor of 5, we expect that the
sphere is not displaced when the tip is scanned over it
under TE illumination. Note that apertureless probes
are often used in tapping mode when imaging a surface.
This mode minimizes the lateral motion imparted to the
object by the optical force.

We have shown that a tungsten probe can be used to
trap eﬃciently a nanometric object above a surface using
TM illumination. For nanomanipulation it is important
to assess the stability of the trap as the probe lifts the
particle oﬀ the substrate. Figure 5 shows the z compo-

nent of the force when the sphere is ﬁxed at the apex of
the tip and the tip is moved vertically (solid and dashed
curves). The optical force remains larger than the weight
of the particle over a range of several tens of nanometers.
The particle can therefore be manipulated vertically as
well as horizontally. Note that the evolution of the force
with the distance to the substrate is linear rather than
exponential. The particle experience a negative gradi-
ent force due the exponential decay of the intensity of
the illumination. At the same time, the particle suﬀers
a positive gradient force due to the ﬁeld enhancement at
the tip apex, which also decreases exponentially with z
because this enhancement depends on the intensity of the
evanescent illuminating light. The competition between
these two contributions results in an weak decrease of
the trapping force as the particle is moved away from
the substrate. If we change the nature, size or shape of
the object the magnitude of the force changes but the
conclusions are qualitatively the same (Fig. 5, curves
with symbols).

It is fundamental to know whether our procedure also
works if several particles are clustered together. We con-
sider a set of three spheres (radius 10 nm, permittivity
2.25) aligned along x. The probe is placed above the
middle sphere. We account for the multiple scattering be-
tween the three spheres, the substrate and the tip, there-
fore the optical binding experienced by the spheres [14]
is included in our description. For this conﬁguration, TE
illumination again does not lead to trapping. For TM
illumination, we plot in Fig. 6 the z component of the
force experienced by the middle sphere and by those on
the sides as a function of the vertical distance between the
probe and the middle sphere. For an angle of incidence
θ = 43◦, the z component of the force, although largest

3

for the middle sphere, is positive for all the spheres. This
could be a problem if one wanted to manipulate only one
particle. The central particle can be selectively trapped
by increasing the angle of incidence of the illuminating
beams to tighten the trap in the x direction (Fig. 4). In
Fig. 6 we see that for θ = 50◦ the optical force induced
by the probe is positive only for the middle sphere. This
remains true for three spheres aligned along y. Figure
7 shows the extraction of the middle sphere by the tip.
Our calculation shows that the vertical force experienced
by the two side spheres remains negative when the probe
moves away from the substrate. Therefore, the spheres
on the sides do not hinder the capture of the middle
sphere.

In Fig. 7, the curve with circles shows that the se-
lective trapping works as well when the middle sphere is
twice as big as the others. Once the chosen particle has

been trapped, it can be moved above the substrate. Our
calculations show that the presence of other particles on
the substrate does not destroy the trap, provided that
during the manipulation the trapped sphere is kept at
least 5 nm above the spheres that are on the substrate.
We have checked that if the optical binding causes the
side spheres to move laterally toward the middle sphere,
increasing the angle of illumination still creates a nega-
tive (downward) force on the two side spheres, and the
selective capture of the middle sphere is not hampered.
The procedure to trap a small object with a tungsten
tip is therefore the following: ﬁrst TE illumination is
used while the tip scans the surface in tapping mode or
in constant-height mode if the area under investigation
is small enough. Such modes avoid the displacement of
the particle by the tip. Once an object has been selected,
the probe is placed above the object and the polarization
of the illumination is rotated to TM. The probe is then
brought down over the particle and captures it. The
probe can then move the particle above the substrate,
both horizontally and vertically, to a new position where
it can be released by switching back to TE polarization
(note that if, for some reason, one wishes to move the
particle over distances larger than the size of the illumi-
nation spot, one could move the sample with piezoelectric
device once the sphere is trapped at the apex of the tip).
The lack of trapping under TE illumination is actually an
important advantage during the imaging (selection) and
release phases of the manipulation.
Indeed, under TE
illumination, when the tip is above a particle it actually
increases the downward optical force, which contributes
to prevent the tip from sweeping the particle away.

In conclusion, we propose a new method to trap and
manipulate nanometric particles in air above a substrate,
using an apertureless tungsten probe. The probe is used
to scatter two counter-propagating evanescent waves,
generating an optical trap at the apex. We showed that
an object of a few nanometers, can be selectively trapped
and manipulated. An interesting extension of this work
will be a study of the inﬂuence of diﬀerent illuminations
(e.g. focused beam) and a systematic study of the inﬂu-
ence of the nature of the particle and the tip on the trap-
ping mechanism. For example, the strong spectral depen-
dence of the electromagnetic response of metal particles
(or resonance excitation of both dielectric and metallic
particles) could lead to a material selective trapping.

[9] Because typical laser coherence times are small, (e.g.
200ps for an Argon laser), a simple calculation shows
that a glass sphere with a radius of 10 nm, trapped by

an optical force of about 4pN, will see spatial ﬂuctuations
in the 30 pm range, due to the laser phase ﬂuctuation.
Therefore, in real cases the trapped particule will only
feel the time-averaged trapping potential, without actu-
ally being perturbed by the laser ﬂuctuations.

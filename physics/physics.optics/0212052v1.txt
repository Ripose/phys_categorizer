We analyze transmission of a layered photonic structure (a one-dimensional photonic crystal)
consisting of alternating slabs of two materials with positive and negative refractive index. For the
periodic structure with zero averaged refractive index, we demonstrate a number of unique properties
of the beam transmission observed in strong beam modiﬁcation and reshaping.

Recent experimental results conﬁrmed the existence of
a novel type of composite materials, the so-called left-
handed (LH) metamaterials (or materials with both neg-
ative permittivity and permeability), which possess the
property of negative refraction. Such materials were sug-
gested theoretically a long time ago [1], but they have
recently attracted much attention due to their experi-
mental realization and recent ‘hot’ debates on the use of
a LH slab as a perfect lens to focus both propagating
and evanescent waves [2]. The perfect lens concept was
ﬁrst suggested by Pendry [3], who demonstrated that a
slab of a lossless negative-refraction material can provide
a perfect image of a point source. Although the perfect
image is a result of an ideal theoretical model employed
in the analysis of Ref. [3], the resolution limit was shown
to be independent on the wavelength of electromagnetic
wave (but can be determined by other sources such as
loss, spatial dispersion, etc.), and it can be better than
the resolution of a conventional lens [4].

Multilayered structures containing LH materials can
be considered as a sequence of the perfect lenses and,
therefore, they are expected to possess novel and unique
transmission properties. Such multilayered structures
have been investigated theoretically for calculating the
transmittance or reﬂectance in the Bragg regime [5, 6].
More recently, it was shown that a one-dimensional stack
of layers with alternating right- and left-handed materi-
als with zero averaged refractive index displays a narrow
spectral gap in the transmission [7, 8], which is quite
diﬀerent from a Bragg reﬂection gap.

In this Letter, we study the properties of layered pho-
tonic structures consisting of alternating slabs of positive
and negative refractive index materials (see Fig. 1), and
demonstrate unusual angular dependencies for the trans-
mission of such slabs when the averaged refractive index
is close to zero. We demonstrate how these properties
can be employed for strong beam reshaping.

We consider a one-dimensional photonic crystal formed
by alternative slabs, as schematically shown in Fig. 1.
We assume that the periodic structure is made from the
materials of two types: the slabs of the width b are made
of a LH material, and they are separated by the right-
handed (RH) layers of the width a. Such a structure can
be treated as an array of Pendry’s perfect lenses with the

In comparison with the conventional case of the peri-

feature of the LH materials is their frequency dispersion,
so that in most of the cases we can ﬁnd the characteris-

structure consisting of the alternating LH and RH slabs
of the same thickness (a = b) will formally possess a
bandgap for all angles of incidence, with the only excep-
tion of the 100% transmission resonances, which appear
when the arguments of the sinus functions in Eq. (3)
are equal to the whole multiple of π. Such highly un-
usual transmission can happen because the “zero-index”
bandgap does not depend on the optical period of the
structure, whereas usual Bragg-reﬂection and transmis-
sion resonances are highly sensitive to variations of the
period and the incident angle.

It is important to study the transmission properties
of a realistic system when the resonant conditions may
not be exactly satisﬁed. To be speciﬁc, let us consider a
periodic structure consisting of the layers of LH metama-
terial separated by air. We assume that the composite
material possesses the negative refractive index in the mi-

where ωp/2π = 10 GHz, ωr/2π = 4 GHz, and F = 0.56.
The frequency range, where both ǫ and µ are negative
is (4 - 6) GHz. We plot the corresponding band-gap on
the plane (ω, kx) [see Fig. 2]. We reveal that for a ﬁxed
incident angle (kx) there appears a single frequency gap
inside the transmission region. Quite a diﬀerent situa-
tion occurs for the anglular dependence of the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient at a given frequency, when there exists a
narrow transmission band inside the bandgap.

Fig. 2(b) corresponds to the case a = b = a0 + 0.03 cm

riod is further increased, multiple transmission bands are
observed. The width of the transmission band in the k-
space can be controlled by tuning the frequency in the
vicinity of ω0. The insets in Fig. 2 show the cross-sections

by dashed lines. Thus, one can make a periodic structure
with the transmission band at the desired angle of inci-
dence by a proper choice of the system period, while the
width of the transmission band can be adjusted by tuning
the frequency. Similarly, the structures with more com-
plicated transmission properties which include multiple
rings in the transmission coeﬃcient vs wavevector can be
obtained. Most importantly, we ﬁnd that such narrow-
band angular ﬁlters can have almost 100% transparency
in the transmission region.

We now use the standard transfer matrix method to
analyse beam shaping by a ﬁnite composite structure
consisting of 100 layers with the parameters correspond-
ing to the angular transmission coeﬃcient shown in the
inset of Fig. 2(b). We consider the transmission of (2+1)-
dimensional beams in the paraxial approximation when
the angles of incidence are small and polarization eﬀects
are negligable. For a Gaussian beam incident at a nor-
mal angle, we observe almost complete reﬂection if the
the angular spectrum width is comparable to the width
of the transmission band. Transmission is only possible
at the incident angles when the spectra overlap, and un-
der such conditions the reﬂected beam has a two-humped
shape, see Fig. 3(a). On the other hand, vortex beams

have a ring structure of the angular spectrum and can
therefore be very eﬀectively transmitted even at the nor-
mal incidence [Fig. 3(b)]. Similar to the case of a Gaus-
sian beam, we observe that the weak reﬂected beam has a
two-hump vortex structure. Small variations of the angle
of incidence from the normal destroy the structure of the
reﬂected and transmitted vortex beams and the results
depend on the vortex topological charge [see Fig. 3(c)].

A beam reﬂected by an interface experiences a shift of
its center relative to the center of the incident beam, and
this classical eﬀect is known as the Goos-H¨anchen shift
(see, e.g. Ref. [10, 11]). Reﬂection from a single LH slab
results in a negative Goos-H¨anchen shift [12], and it is in-
teresting to calculate the beam shift for the layered struc-
ture. The centers of the incident and reﬂected beams
2 dr⊥,
r⊥
are found as Xi,r =
Ei,r
|

where r⊥ is the transverse coordinate in the plane (x, y).
For wide beams (i.e. the beams with a narrow spectrum),
Xi is determined by the gradient of
the shift ∆ = Xr
the phase φ of the reﬂection coeﬃcient, ∆ =
k⊥ φ.
We calculate the Goos-H¨anchen shift for the beam re-
ﬂected by the periodic RH/LH structure described above,
using the parameters corresponding to Fig. 2(b). With
no loss of generality, we assume that the (x, z) plane is
the plane of incidence, and therefore the beam is only
shifted along the x axis. We plot the shifts experienced
by the Gaussian beam of various widths (see the curves
1-3 in Fig. 4). We see that the shift of wide beams indeed
approaches the the asymptotic result shown with dashed
line in Fig. 4. The shift can be either positive and neg-
ative, and the absolute value increases dramatically for
the angles of incidence close to the transmission band.

In conclusion, we have analyzed the transmission prop-
erties of a one-dimensional photonic crystal composed of
two materials with positive and negative refractive in-
dices. We have demonstrated unusual angular depen-
dencies of the beam transmission through such composite
structures which can be used for eﬃcient beam reshap-
ing. We have calculated the Goos-H¨anchen shift of the
reﬂected beam which is shown to increase dramatically
for the angles of incidence close to the transmission band.

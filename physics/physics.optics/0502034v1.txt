A new CAD program, PolyCAD, designed for X-ray photon traing in

polyapillary optis is desribed. To understand the PolyCAD ode and

its results, the theoretial basis of X-ray transmission by a single ylin-

drial hannel (monoapillary) is disussed (cid:28)rst. Then the simplest ases

of ylindrially and onially shaped polyapillary optis are examined.

PolyCAD allows any type of X-ray soure to be used: an X-ray tube of

(cid:28)nite beam dimensions or an astrophysial ob jet an be simulated in

ombination with the polyapillary optis. The radiation distribution im-

ages formed on a sreen loated at various foal distanes are disussed.

The good agreement of some of the PolyCAD results with those reported

in earlier papers validate the ode. This is the (cid:28)rst paper of a series

dediated to the development of an exhaustive CAD program, work is in

progress to develop the ode to inlude other polyapillary-optis shapes,

suh as semi-lenses and full-lenses.

1 Introdution

The use of polyapillary optis to ontrol X-ray beams in analytial X-ray ap-

paratus for di(cid:27)ration and (cid:29)uoresene analyses is beoming inreasingly im-

portant. In the near future polyapillary optis will be widely used in many

di(cid:27)erent (cid:28)elds, e.g., aero-spae researh, mediine, biology, and so on [1℄ . Our

strong interest in the development of these devies led to the idea of reating a

CAD program that allows one to simulate the proess of radiation propagation

through polyapillary optial systems and to visualize the radiation distribu-

tions at the optial output. At present there are very few proedures available

for evaluating X-ray transmission by apillary strutures in the ase of peuliar

1

on(cid:28)gurations, see for instane [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8℄ . One of the (cid:28)rst papers [2℄

reported oherent radiation transmission by a hollow glass pipe. This ode also

onsidered i) the presene of a rough surfae as an X-ray anomalous disper-

sion e(cid:27)et, ii) radiation penetration into the hannel wall, and iii) the possible

presene of miro-dust inside the hannel.

Another algorithm [3℄ for X-ray transmission by apillaries of various shapes

runs in the geometrial optis approximation; for this reason is simpler and

more (cid:29)exible than the previous model.

The (cid:28)rst X-ray traing odes were developed in 1992 [4, 5℄ and by the In-

stitute for Roentgen Optis, for a review see [11℄ . However, these simulations

used a number of simpli(cid:28)ations based either on the ylindrial symmetry for

a shaped apillary system or on the meridional ray approximation, whih is

valid only for desribing radiation propagation through a blend hannel or a

monoapillary onentrator.

To the authors' knowledge, the most advaned and omplete softwares for

X-ray traing inside apillary hannels to date are three: the (cid:28)rst ode [6, 9℄

traes the tra jetory of eah photon inluding the orretions of absorption

and roughness; in aording with some experimental results, the authors ould

obtain the roughness of the hannel. The seond one [7℄ uses the SHADOW ray

traing software, adapting it to hannel shape.

The last ode [8, 10℄ uses a Monte Carlo simulation for X-ray radiation prop-

agation through hollow hannels. The theoretial results obtained by this ode

agree quite well with the experimental data, although the algorithm is rather

simple due to its geometrial optis approximation and to the irular ross

setion of the hannel shape.

The main aim of pratially all the simulation odes is to optimize both the

hannel size and the optial shape in order to obtain highly e(cid:30)ient optial sys-

tems. Obviously, this is very important from the viewpoint of the development

of apillary optis tehnology. However, analysis of the radiation distribution

features, reported in a number of papers [12, 13, 14℄ is partiularly interesting.

(Some of the earlier publiations are ited in referene [14℄). In these papers

the experimental data were validated by means of analytial estimations based

on the wave theory of radiation propagation.

Before we ontinue any further, let us larify the terminology used in this

work: 1) a monoapillary is a single apillary; 2) a polyapillary is a set of

losely and paked monoapillaries; 3) a lens is a devie that onentrate the

radiation in a point or a small region; 4) a semi-lens, or a half-lens is a devie

that an onentrate a quasi-parallel beam in a point and vie versa in the

reverse geometry.

Here, we introdue a new X-ray traing ode for polyapillary optis, named

PolyCAD. A previous version was designed for ylindrial optis only [15, 16℄ .

Now, the software an simulate monoapillary and polyapillary optis with

ylindrial and onial shapes, while work is in progress to inlude lenses and

semi-lenses. The advantage of the ode lies in its preise mathematial solutions

for eah given optial shape. Comparison of the results of PolyCAD and of the

previous algorithms [5, 6, 7, 8, 11℄ revealed some di(cid:27)erenes, due to the fat that

2

PolyCAD is free of many of the algorithmi onstraints.

In the (cid:28)rst part of our paper, the theoretial basis of a ylindrial monoap-

illary is explained; in the seond, the numerial results and the simulations are

reported both for ylindrial and for onial mono- and polyapillaries, using a

point-soure and an extended-soures, like a onventional X-ray tube.

2 Theoretial ground

Thanks to some simple formulas it is possible to estimate the orret behavior

of the rays inside the apillary. The total intensity I(θ), evaluated at the angle
θ behind a apillary, is given by all the ontributions of the photon families

that pass through the apillary; eah family is de(cid:28)ned by the number of its

re(cid:29)etions:

I(θ) = I0(θ) + I1(θ) + · · · + IN (θ)

(1)

where N is the maximum number of re(cid:29)etions.

It is lear that the intensity Im(θ) is stritly dependent on the re(cid:29)etion
power of R0 :

oe(cid:30)ient R0 , namely, on the mth

I0(θ) = R0 θ ∈ (−θ0 , θ0)

.

.

.

IN (θ) ∝ RN

0 θ ∈ (−θN , θN )

(2a)

(2b)

This ontribution is drastially small if the number of re(cid:29)etions is high,

beause R0 is always less than one, (Example - R0 = {0.99, 0.8, 0.7} −→ R50
0.61, 1.42 × 10−5, 1.80 × 10−8

).

0 =

In order to onsider the total radiation intensity on a sreen behind a mono-

(cid:8)
apillary, I(θ) has to be integrated over the whole plane, so:

(cid:9)

Itot(θ) =

)

(3)

where the last mathematial passage is possible due to the axial symmetry of

the system.

As an be seen from Fig. 1, if the sreen is plaed at P 1, near the foal point
f 2, haraterized by the ray family with a maximum number of two re(cid:29)etions,

the image on the sreen is smaller than in any other on(cid:28)guration. Moreover,

for only two re(cid:29)etions, there are (cid:28)ve di(cid:27)erent areas of interation (Figs. 1 and

4). However, if the sreen is plaed at P 2, far from the foal point, the piture

on the sreen does not have a simple shape, but has some zones that are more

intense than others (Figs. 1 and 6).

Now that the radiation intensity has been de(cid:28)ned (Eq. 3), the inner surfae

of the apillary an be divided into a disrete set of zones aording to the

number (1, 2,. . . ) of re(cid:29)etions of eah photon tra jetory. If the origin of the

referene system (x, y, z) is loated at the end of the apillary and the z-axis

3

oinides with the apillary axis, eah zone along the surfae has a length given

by the following equation:

z(θ) ≃ f × I(θ),

(θ ≪ 1)

(4)

where f is the distane between the end of the apillary and the sreen. Looking

at Fig. 2 and onsidering only the upper propagation ase, eah area has a

maximum angle θ and a portion of interation on the sreen, de(cid:28)ned by:

From these formulas it is lear that the di(cid:27)erene between two onseutive

maximum angles is a onstant and depends only on the properties of the system.

When these properties are (cid:28)xed, the maximum number of re(cid:29)etions is simple

to evaluate:

Sine there must be at least one re(cid:29)etion, Eq. 7 beomes the well known

expression:

(5a)

(5)

(5d)

(6a)

(6b)

(6)

(6d)

(7)

(8)

Equation 8 states that the maximum number of re(cid:29)etions depends only

on the length and on the diameter of the apillary; this result is exat if the

soure stays along the monoapillary z-axis. Equation 8 also remains a good

approximation if the soure is lose to the optial axis (Fig. 12). Obviously,

in the general ase, there are some problems beause an o(cid:27)-axis soure makes

some zones inside the apillary unsuitable for photon re(cid:29)etion [17℄ .

3 The ode

In our previous paper [15℄ the ode was based only on the geometrial symmetry

of the system, so the radiation image on a sreen ould be evaluated only if the

shape of apillary was ylindrial. This new version of PolyCAD is ompletely

di(cid:27)erent from the old one.

While upgrading the ode to inlude other apillary shapes, the ompliated

de(cid:28)nition of the re(cid:29)etion angle αref introdued some problems. For a ylin-
drial apillary it is easy to (cid:28)nd the following relation for αref :

αref = arccos

= arccos

cos α
cos ω

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

cos α
cos [arctan (tan α × sin θ)]

(cid:26)

(9)

(cid:27)

where α is the zenithal angle and θ is the angle on the inlet plane (see Fig. 3

and Ref. [15℄).

In the onial ase, the ω angle, formed by the two pro jetions on the tangent
plane of the X-ray photon tra jetory and of the z-axis, is still a funtion of α
and θ, but now there is also an indiret dependene on the onial semi-opening
angle β . This indiret dependene is due to the fat that the tra jetory of a

photon is generally oblique with respet to the apillary axis. Thus, a new

parameter that takes into aount the o(cid:27)-axis angle must be inluded, whih

does not allow us to transfer in a simple way a 3-D problem into a 2-D one, as

done in the ase of ylindrial optis [15℄ . Nevertheless, by knowing the photon

starting point, i.e., the soure point Ps and the inlet point P0 , it is possible

to de(cid:28)ne the vetor-diretion of the photon. An equation system between the

photon path and the apillary surfae equation makes it possible to desribe the

tra jetory of the photons inside any generi apillary optis.

4 Numerial results

To show how PolyCAD works, we report the most signi(cid:28)ant results. We would

like to emphasize that PolyCAD an simulate any kind of soure, from a point

soure, loated at (cid:28)nite or in(cid:28)nite distane, to an extended soure, and the

latter an also have a 3-D shape.

4.1 Cylindrial monoapillary

We (cid:28)rst onsidered a monoapillary or polyapillary with ylindrial hannels.

Even though the system geometry in this ase is so simple that the results an

5

be alulated manually, to hek that the software worked well the results were

ompared with those of the old version of PolyCAD designed just for ylindrial

apillaries [15, 16℄ .

As a preliminary step we onsidered a point soure loated at (cid:28)nite distane.

The amplitude of the inident angle α an be hosen randomly from zero to any

pre(cid:28)xed value. Obviously, in the best ase this angle is equal to the ritial

angle, α = θc . Moreover, eah X-ray photon will have an inlet angle δ in the Ip
plane that is stritly onneted with the intersetion point P0 (x0, y0) (Fig. 3).

To simplify the analysis of the radiation distribution behind the apillary

system, the image shape was onsidered in two di(cid:27)erent sreen positions: i) one

plaed at the fous f2 of the monoapillary or polyapillary and ii) the other

beyond the f2 position (Fig. 1).

To ompare these alulations with the results obtained by Dabagov and

Marelli [12℄ , the length of the ylindrial monoapil lary was hosen suh as

to provide at least a double re(cid:29)etion mode of propagation. The (cid:28)nal results

obtained are illustrated in Figs. 4, 6 and 8.

The onditions for the simulation are:

i) a 1 keV point soure and ii) a

ylindrial monoapillary 10 m long with a radius of ρ = 10−1

m. In Figs. 4

and 5 a single entral spot is present and four rings formed by the onvergent

rays related to the di(cid:27)erent re(cid:29)etion numbers (ompare Figs. 4 and 1).

In Figs. 6 and 7 many sharp rings are present. The entral ring is given

by the X-ray photons that ross the monoapillary without interating with the

surfae. The seond is formed by X-ray photons that hit, one at worst, the

monoapillary inner surfae. The third ring is due to X-rays that produe only

one re(cid:29)etion with the hannel. The fourth ring is due to X-rays that make one

or two re(cid:29)etions. Finally the outer ring is formed by ray vetors that undergo

only two re(cid:29)etions.

4.2 Cylindrial polyapillary

In the ase of a ylindrial polyapil lary the simulation parameters are i) a 1

keV point soure; ii) a polyapillary 10 m long with a radius of ρ = 1 m; iii)
a single-hannel radius of 10−3

m.

Looking at Fig. 8, for this on(cid:28)guration it is possible to observe a slightly

bigger spot in the enter, while the point density distribution of the halo de-

reases going from the enter to the periphery. This last e(cid:27)et is due to the fat

that eah X-ray photon interats many times with the hannel surfae and the

number of interations inreases going from the enter to the periphery.

4.3 Conial monoapillary

As the next step we will onsider a onial apillary with an X-ray point soure

loated at (cid:28)nite distane. Even though the amplitude of the inident angle

α an be hosen in a random way from zero to any pre(cid:28)xed value, in order to

maximize the number of inoming photons that undergo total external re(cid:29)etion

6

the following relation should be satis(cid:28)ed: α+β = θc , where β is the semi-opening

angle of the one.

It is not a simple job to de(cid:28)ne the foal plane for a onial apillary be-

ause eah photon after eah interation with the hannel surfae undergoes a

number of re(cid:29)etions with inreasing inidene angular values: α + 2 β , α + 4 β ,

. . . et., aording to the di(cid:27)erent diretions of the inident rays. Taking this

into aount we deided to hoose the position of the foal plane by minimizing

the divergene of the exit beam. To ompare the results of the onial and

ylindrial apillaries, we again hose X-ray photons that undergo at least two

re(cid:29)etions.

The parameters of the onial monoapillary are similar to the ylindrial,

i.e., i) the apillary length is 10 m; ii) the entrane radius ρi = 10−1
the exit radius is ρf = 0.8 × 10−1

m; iii) the energy of the photon is still 1 keV.

m, while

As for the ylindrial apillary, simulations of the foal and out-of-fous

radiation distributions are shown in Figs. 9, 10 for the onial monoapil lary.

4.4 Conial polyapillary

For a onial polyapil lary the simulation results are shown in Fig. 11. The

parameters are:

i) a 1 keV point soure; ii) a polyapillary 10 m long with

the entering radius of ρi = 1 m, while the exit radius is ρf = 0.8 m; iii) a
single-hannel radius of 10−3

m and 0.8×10−3

m, respetively for the entering

and the exit plane.

In a following paper we will disuss in more detail the di(cid:27)erenes between

onial and ylindrial apillaries. In partiular we will show that the onial

apillary has a more intense entral spot and also a bigger halo.

4.5 Cylindrial monoapillary, o(cid:27) axis ase

In this setion, we disuss the problem of an X-ray soure loated o(cid:27)-axis. The

point soure an be loated at (cid:28)nite or at in(cid:28)nite distane from the apillary,

so the behavior of a ylindrial monoapil lary system di(cid:27)ers aordingly (Figs.

Figure 12 shows a simulation of a ylindrial monoapillary with a point

soure that is not plaed along the z-axis, with oordinates: Ps = (0.05, 0.05, 3.3)

m. The other physial parameters are apillary length = 10 m, apillary radius

We would like to point out that in this on(cid:28)guration the image has a sym-

metri shape with respet to an ideal line, whih has a 45◦

angular inlination

due to the mirror-like behavior of eah half of the hannel. A large irular

halo is also present, due to all the photons that ross the apillary without any

interation.

In Fig. 13 the situation is ompletely di(cid:27)erent beause the point soure is

again loated o(cid:27)-axis but at an in(cid:28)nite distane from the apillary. The zenithal

and equatorial angles of the beam are respetively (α = 1.3◦, δ = 45◦), while
the hannel parameters are, as usual, length = 10 m, radius = 10−1

m. This

7

on(cid:28)guration means that some parts of the internal hannel surfae annot be

reahed by X-ray photons, so now ertain regions in the image are ompletely

empty.

It is essential to emphasize that the zenithal angle is so large that many

regions of the apillary wall will not be ative for X-ray propagation.

4.6 Extended soures

The power of PolyCAD program is that it an deal with any geometrial and

optial on(cid:28)guration. It means that we may easily simulate the behavior of a

soure of (cid:28)nite dimensions like, for example, onventional X-ray tube. In order

to treat this situation an o(cid:27)set for a single point-soure is introdued in the

program.

In suh a mode a (cid:28)nite area soure an be simulated by random

distribution of points inside a spei(cid:28) area. As pratial appliation let to

onsider a `Long Fine Fous' of X-ray tube (for instane, a Cu anode, 8 keV ),
where the eletron spot on the antiathode has the dimension of 0.4 × 12 mm.

Suh kind of tube allows us to have both an `optial point-fous' (Fig. 14) and

an `optial line-fous' (Fig. 15), where in these simulations we used ylindrial

polyapil lary optis. The soure dimensions are respetively 0.4 × 1.2 mm and
0.04 × 12 mm.

5 Conlusion

In this paper we have reported the (cid:28)rst part of a PolyCAD program designed

for apillary optis. Using the ray optis approximation in the ideal ase of total

external re(cid:29)etion, i.e., without absorption e(cid:27)ets by the optial hannel walls,

this algorithm allows us to i) simulate the passage of the X-ray beam inside the

apillary hannels for soures of di(cid:27)erent shapes, ii) visualize the spot images

formed on a sreen at di(cid:27)erent distanes from the optis.

After a desription of the theoretial basis and of the omputational details,

we reported the numerial analysis for various soure-optis on(cid:28)gurations. In

the ase of a ylindrial monoapillary, we found good agreement with previous

results [12℄ , both for single and for multiple re(cid:29)etion modes.

We would like to point out that this ode an aurately desribe the radia-

tion distribution behind the optis, as shown in Figs. 5 and 7. When the soure

is loated along the axis of the apillary, and in partiular taking into aount

a single hannel, photons are present in all the image areas; however it is lear

that by hanging the soure-optis onditions, the photons ould be absent in

some areas.

At present we are working on inreasing the PolyCAD program apabilities

to deal with other polyapillary-optis shapes, suh as semi-lenses and full-

lenses. However, to understand the (cid:28)ne features of X-ray propagation through

polyapillary lenses it is mandatory to onsider the X-ray wave interation with

the inner apillary surfae (see details in the review [14℄). This will onstitute

the future development of PolyCAD.

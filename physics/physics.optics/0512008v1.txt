Abstract

The Bergman–Milton bounds provide limits on the eﬀective permittivity of a com-
posite material comprising two isotropic dielectric materials. We demonstrate that the
usefulness of these bounds is restricted to certain parameter ranges. Speciﬁcally, (a)
for nondissipative materials the bounds may be unlimited if the constituent materials
have relative permittivities of opposite signs; (b) for weakly dissipative materials char-
acterized by relative permittivities with real parts of opposite signs, the bounds may
be exceedingly large.

Keywords: Bergman–Milton bounds; Hashin–Shtrikman bounds; metamaterials

1 Introduction

Increasingly, new materials which exhibit novel and potentially useful electromagnetic re-
sponses are being developed [1, 2]. At the forefront of this rapidly expanding ﬁeld lie meta-
materials [3]. These are artiﬁcial composite materials which exhibit properties that are
either not exhibited by their constituents at all, or not exhibited to the same extent by their
constituents. With the emergence of these new materials — which may exhibit radically
diﬀerent properties to those encountered traditionally in electromagnetics/optics — some
re–evaluation of established theories is necessary. A prime example is provided by the recent
development of metamaterials which support planewave propagation with negative phase
velocity [4]. The experimental demonstration of negative refraction in 2000 prompted an

explosion of interest in issues pertaining to negative phase velocity and negative refraction
[5, 6].

The process of homogenization, whereby two (or more) homogeneous constituent ma-
terials are blended together to produce a composite material which is eﬀectively homoge-
neous within the long–wavelength regime, is an important vehicle in the conceptualization
of metamaterials [7]. The estimation of the eﬀective constitutive parameters of homogenized
composite materials (HCMs) is a well–established process [8], aspects of which have been
revisited recently in light of the development of exotic materials that exhibit properties such
as negative phase velocity. For example, it was demonstrated that two widely used homoge-
nized formalisms, namely the Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms, do not provide
physically plausible estimates of the HCM permittivity within certain parameter regimes [9].
This restricted applicability also applies to the well–known Hashin–Shtrikman bounds [10]
(which coincide with the Maxwell Garnett estimates) on the HCM permittivity.

In view of the limitations of the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, as well as the Maxwell
Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms, we explore in this communication the applicability of
the Bergman–Milton bounds [11, 12]. These are generally held to provide tighter bounds on
the HCM permittivity than those provided by the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. To be speciﬁc,
we consider the homogenization of two isotropic dielectric constituent materials with relative
permittivities ǫa and ǫb. In particular, the regime in which the parameter4

is negative–valued is explored, as this is where the applicability of the Hashin–Shtrikman
bounds is questionable. The δ < 0 regime arises in metal–in–insulator HCMs [13, 14], for
example, and is highly pertinent to the homogenization of HCMs which support planewave
propagation with negative phase velocity.

2 Bergman–Milton bounds

The following bounds on the eﬀective relative permittivity ǫe of the chosen composite material
were established by Bergman [11, 15] and Milton [12, 16]:

BMα(γ) = faǫa + fbǫb −

fafb(ǫb − ǫa)2

and

where fa,b denotes the volume fraction of the constituent material with relative permittivity
ǫa,b, and fa + fb = 1. For the bound BMα the parameter γ takes the values (1 − fa) /3 ≤
γ ≤ 1 − fa/3, whereas for the bound BMβ the parameter γ takes the values 2 (1 − fa) /3 ≤
γ ≤ 1 − 2fa/3.

The Bergman–Milton bounds (2) and (3) are related to the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds

3 Numerical illustrations

Let us now numerically explore the Bergman–Milton bounds, along with the Hashin–Shtrikman
bounds, for some illustrative examples of nondissipative and dissipative HCMs. The param-
eter δ, deﬁned in (1), is used to classify the two constituent materials of the chosen HCMs.

3.1 Nondissipative HCMs

We begin with the most straightforward situation: nondissipative HCMs arising from con-
In Figure 1, the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα and HSα
stituent materials with δ > 0.

are plotted against fa ∈ (0, 1) for ǫa = 6 and ǫb = 2. The Bergman–Milton bound BMβ
is given for fa ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}. The corresponding plots of BMα(γ)
with γ overlies that of BMβ. The Bergman–Milton bounds are entirely contained within the
envelope constructed by the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds; and all four bounds appear to be
physically plausible.

Let us turn now to the nondissipative scenario wherein δ < 0. In Figure 2, the Hashin–
Shtrikman bounds HSα and HSβ are presented as functions of fa for ǫa = −6 and ǫb = 2. The
Bergman–Milton bound BMα is given for fa ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}. The
corresponding Bergman–Milton bound BMβ is plotted in Figure 3. In consonance with (6)
and (7), we see that HSα becomes unbounded as fa → 0.25. It is clear that HSβ ≤ BMα ≤
HSα for fa < 0.25, whereas HSα ≤ BMβ ≤ HSβ for fa > 0.25. For fa > 0.25, the Bergman–
Milton bound BMα lies outside both Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα and HSβ, and similarly
BMβ lies outside both Hashin–Shtrikman bounds HSα and HSβ for fa < 0.25, although the
relations (6) still hold.

3.2 Dissipative HCMs

We turn to homogenization scenarios based on dissipative constituent materials; i.e., ǫa,b ∈ C.
Let us begin with the δ > 0 scenario. In Figure 4, the homogenization of constituents charac-
terized by the relative permittivities ǫa = 6+0.3i and ǫb = 2+0.2i is illustrated. In this ﬁgure,
the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds on complex–valued ǫe are plotted as fa varies from 0 to 1. The
Bergman–Milton bounds, which are graphed for fa ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9},
are fully contained within the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. That is, we have HSβ ≤ BMα,β ≤
HSα for all values of fa.

Now we consider dissipative constituent materials with δ < 0. In Figure 5, the homoge-
nization of constituent materials given by ǫa = −6 + 3i and ǫb = 2 + 2i is represented. The
Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are plotted for fa ∈ (0, 1), whereas the Bergman–Milton bounds
are given for fa ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}. As is the case in Figure 4, BMβ
lies entirely within the envelope constructed by HSα and HSβ. We see that BMα ≥ HSβ
for all values of fa; but, for mid–range values of fa, BMα slightly exceeds HSα for certain
values of the parameter γ. We remark that both the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds and the
Bergman–Milton bounds are physically plausible for this example.

As the degree of dissipation exhibited by the constituent materials is decreased, the
extent to which BMα exceeds HSα is increased. This is illustrated in Figure 6 wherein the
homogenization is repeated with ǫa = −6 + i and ǫb = 2 + 2i/3. As in Figure 4, the Hashin–
Shtrikman bounds are plotted for fa ∈ (0, 1), while the Bergman–Milton bounds are given
for fa ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}. The Bergman–Milton bound BMβ lies within
the Hashin–Shtrikman bound envelope for all values of fa, but substantial parts of BMα lie
well outside the envelope of the two Hashin–Shtrikman bounds.

The behaviour observed in Figures 5 and 6 is further exaggerated in Figure 7, where the
homgenization of constituent materials with ǫa = −6 + 0.3i and ǫb = 2 + 0.2i is represented.
The Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are plotted for fa ∈ (0, 1); for reasons of clarity, the Bergman–
Milton bounds are plotted only for fa ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}. The Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are

4

exceedingly large and the Bergman–Milton bounds are larger still.

4 Discussion and conclusions

The Bergman–Milton bounds, as well as the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, are valuable for
estimating the eﬀective constitutive parameters of HCMs in many commonly encountered
circumstances. However, the advent of exotic new materials and metamaterials has lead
to the examination of such bounds within parameter regimes which may not have been
anticipated at the time of their development. It was recently demonstrated that the Hashin–
Shtrikman bounds are not useful when the relative permittivities of the constituent materials
ǫa and ǫb are such that [9]

(i) Re (ǫa) and Re (ǫb) have opposite signs; and

(ii) |Re (ǫa,b) | ≫ |Im (ǫa,b) |.

In the preceding sections of this communication, we have demonstrated that the Bergman–
Milton bounds likewise do not provide useful limits on the value of ǫe within the same
parameter regime.

We note that if the real parts of ǫa and ǫb have opposite signs, but are of the same order
of magnitude as their imaginary parts, then the Bergman–Milton bounds are indeed useful,
and they lie within the envelope constructed by the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds.

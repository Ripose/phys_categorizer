We prove that spatial Kerr solitons, usually obtained in the frame of nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion valid in the paraxial approximation, can be found in a generalized form as exact solutions of
Maxwell’s equations. In particular, they are shown to exist, both in the bright and dark version, as
linearly polarized exactly integrable one-dimensional solitons, and to reduce to the standard paraxial
form in the limit of small intensities. In the two-dimensional case, they are shown to exist as az-
imuthally polarized circularly symmetric dark solitons. Both one and two-dimensional dark solitons
exhibit a characteristic signature in that their asymptotic intensity cannot exceed a threshold value
in correspondence of which their width reaches a minimum subwavelength value.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The analytic description of spatial Kerr solitons, initiated by the seminal paper of Chiao et al.,[1] has been con-
tinuously evolving in the last forty years.[2, 3] It basically hinges upon the use of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
(NLS), which in turn follows from the nonlinear Helmholtz equation once the paraxial approximation, limiting the size
σ of the propagating beam to values large compared to the wavelength λ, is introduced. This approximation becomes
inappropriate if the beam size σ is comparable with λ, a regime where nonparaxial eﬀects become important and
are eventually able to provide a mechanism for avoiding nonphysical behaviors (like,e.g., catastrophic collapse) in the
beam evolution. Although many contributions have been produced in this direction,[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] they
are typically based on some form of asymptotic expansion in the smallness parameter η = λ/σ and are thus limited to
the range η < 1. To overcome this limitation, we start ab initio from Maxwell’s equations and look for exact soliton
solutions. More precisely, we solve Maxwell’s equations in the presence of a fully vectorial Kerr polarizability and ﬁnd
a class of perfect optical solitons which inherently include all nonparaxial contributions. This is separately performed
for one dimensional and two dimensional spatial solitons, both in the bright and dark conﬁguration. In particular,
the one dimensional case is dealt with by reducing Maxwell’s equations to a system of ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations
and handling it by appealing to the usual formalism employed in the frame of dynamical systems. Our system is
shown to posses a ﬁrst integral so that its integrability is proved and the boundary value problem, associated with
solitons, solved in closed analytical form.

One the main results obtained in this paper is the proof of the existence of exact solutions of Maxwell equations
in the form of linearly polarized one dimensional Kerr solitons: they do not suﬀer of any limitation on the value of
σ and λ (apart from the obvious ones associated with the validity of the macroscopic model of Kerr polarizability)
and their existence curve can be numerically evaluated for all values of the beam intensity. Both bright and dark
solitons can be derived from an integrable system of equations and their existence curve shows that, in the case of
bright solitons, any value of the peak intensity u2
x0 is allowed, while dark solitons can only exist if their asymptotic
intensity u2
does not exceed a threshold value completely determined by Kerr coeﬃcients. In correspondence to
x
this threshold, their width approaches the minimum value of the order of a fraction of λ. In the two dimensional case,
dark azimuthally polarized solitons are found and their existence curve implies, the same threshold behavior of the
one dimensional dark solitons. While one dimensional solitons reduce to the standard paraxial ones for small values
of the intensity, the two dimensional azimuthal dark soliton is a completely new entity which has never been studied
in the paraxial regime.

∞

We wish to note that the proof of the existence and derivation of exact solitons requires, in the one dimensional
case, the use of a rather sophisticated mathematical analysis borrowed from the dynamical system formalism, which
we decide to report in full in section 2.

requirement not forbidden by Maxwell’s equations. From Eqs.(5), it is also evident that the z
component Uz
1) which describes a family of solitary plane waves rather than solitons
only vanishes if Ux =
[15]. The fact that Uz does not generally vanish is a consequence of the vectorial coupling between transverse and
longitudinal components which cannot be rigorously neglected when describing spatially nonuniform ﬁelds, like for
examples solitons (From a physical point of view, this follows from the ﬁrst Maxwell equation setting the divergence
of the electric ﬁeld). Note that the longitudinal component is usually neglected in the paraxial regime thanks to the
slow variation of the transverse component as compared to the wavelength λ = 2π/k, a circumstance which allows to
treat it as a perturbation for slightly nonparaxial beams [16, 17]. In the present paper, we deal on equal foot with
both transverse and longitudinal components and it is their simultaneous non-vanishing and coupling which allows us
to ﬁnd exact solitons.

are particular orbits which, for suitable values of β, pass through two special points of the phase plane imposed by
the boundary conditions pertinent to each soliton kind (boundary value problem).

this system is equivalent to Maxwell’s equations. According to Eq.(8), any solution of Eqs.(6) is constrained to move
along a single level set

F (ux, uz|

β) = F0.

Inverting Eq.(10) furnishes uz = uz(ux, F0, β) which, once inserted into the ﬁrst of Eqs.(6), yields a ﬁrst order
diﬀerential equation solvable by quadratures, thus proving the integrability of Eqs.(6). Note that the ﬁrst integral in
Eq.(9) contains even powers of ux and uz only so that any level set of Eq.(10) is invariant under the inversion of the
phase plane (ux, uz)

(ux, uz).

Exploiting the properties of the ﬁrst integral found above, we are now in a position to solve in a direct way the
soliton boundary value problem, that is to ﬁnd suitable values of β (if any) for which a solution ux(ξ), uz(ξ) of Eqs.(6)

turn requires u

remaining condition we have to impose is the ﬁrst of Eq.(12) that is

In order to set the boundary condition u0 we note that, because of the invariance of the level set in Eq.(10) under
inversion of the phase plane, a soliton has to be associated with an integral curve starting from and ending into the
origin and that this curve has to be symmetric under either the reﬂection ux → −
uz.
Because of these symmetry properties, we have u0 = (0 uz0)T and u0 = (ux0 0)T (where the symbol T stands for
transposed) in the former and in the latter case, respectively. In the ﬁrst case, Eq.(14) becomes β2u2
z0 + 1) = 0
which implies β = 0, so that soliton propagation is not allowed. We are left to consider the case u0 = (ux0 0)T for
which Eq.(14) furnishes

ux or the reﬂection uz → −

z0(γu2

In appendix A, we prove that bright solitons exist for all the real values of ux0 in focusing media (γ = 1) and that they
never exist in defocusing media (γ =
1) in agreement with the intuitive behavior of Kerr nonlinearity which tends
to tighten and to spread the beam in these two cases, respectively. Obviously, the above results about the existence
of bright solitons are based on the validity of Eq.(2), which fails either for large intensities or for soliton widths so
small to invalidate the continuum description of the material response. For γ = 1, Eq. (15) yields

−

−

p
which is the propagation constant of the exact bright solitons. The double sign in Eq.(16) describes the two counter-
propagating solitons along the z

axis.

Substituting Eq.(16) and F0 = 0 into Eq.(10), we obtain the equation for the integral curves on the phase plane
corresponding to bright solitons, and these are reported, for some values of ux0, in Figure 1. Note that, for each
, the corresponding level set is a bow-tie shaped curve encompassing three orbits of Eqs.(6), that is the origin
ux0|
|
(which is an equilibrium point) and the left and right loop of the bow-tie. These last two orbits correspond to a pair
of bright solitons each of which can be obtained from the other after the inversion of the x
ξ (implying
ux also), as expected because of the reﬂection invariance along any directions shown by Kerr
the reﬂection ux → −
nonlinearity. Considering the right half plane ux > 0 only, we observe that soliton curve ux(ξ), uz(ξ) explore the loop
starting form the origin (for ξ =
), reaching the point (ux, uz) = (ux0, 0) (for ξ = 0) and ending into the origin
). From Eqs.(6) it is evident that the loop is explored counter-clockwise and clockwise for β > 0 and
(for ξ = +
)
β < 0, respectively, so that, for counter-propagating solitons (denoted with (+) and (

Eqs.(6) by quadrature). In Figure 2, we report the plots of the transverse ux and longitudinal uz components of the
bright solitons for the same ux0 as in Figure 1. Note that, as expected, the soliton width decreases for increasing
ux0, while the longitudinal component uz increases. In Figure 3, we report the bright soliton existence curve, relating

C. The Optical Intensity

Having derived the electric ﬁeld (see Eq.(4)) associated to both bright and dark solitons, we can directly evaluate
the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld by means of the pertinent Maxwell equation. Substituting Eq.(4) into the ﬁrst of
Eqs.(1) we easily deduce, in terms of the dimensionless ﬁelds,

The above description of one dimensional bright and dark solitons is exact, no approximation having been exploited
in their analytical derivation. As a consequence, the solitons described above are expected to reduce, in the paraxial
limit where the soliton width is much larger than the wavelength, to those predicted by the NLS. The paraxial limit
is clearly obtained by considering the range of values

since the soliton width increases for decreasing optical intensities while the longitudinal component decreases. By
diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst of Eqs.(6), using the second of Eqs.(6) to eliminate duz/dξ and exploiting Eqs.(23) to retain
only the ﬁrst relevant order, we obtain

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the problem of the existence of nonparaxial spatial Kerr solitons has been completely solved. This has
been done by showing that spatial solitons can be derived as exact solutions of Maxwell equations (thus making, within
our approach, the term ”paraxial” and ”nonparaxial” redundant). In the one dimensional case, the perfect optical
soliton represents the straightforward generalization of the paraxial one, the main diﬀerence being that dark solitons
exhibit, unlike their paraxial counterpart, a speciﬁc upper limit for the possible values their asymptotic intensity can
assume. In the two dimensional case, the exact dark soliton is of a completely new kind, and the diﬀerence between
paraxial and nonparaxial becomes rather meaningless.
In any case, the comparison between paraxial and exact
solitons, done, for example, by inspecting the relative existence curves, shows that our solitons are a deﬁnite entity,
independent from used the approximation scheme: the transition between the paraxial and the highly diﬀractive
regime is very smooth and does not exhibit any kind of dramatic catastrophic behavior, as implied by the standard
paraxial theory.

APPENDIX A: APPENDIX A: EXISTENCE OF BRIGHT SOLITONS IN FOCUSING MEDIA

In order to tackle the problem of bright solitons existence we have to prove that the curve deﬁned in Eq.(14), with
β2 given by Eq.(15), actually reaches the origin of the phase plane (ux, uz). To this end, it is convenient to introduce
the polar coordinate deﬁned by ux = ρ cos φ and uz = ρ sin φ, so that Eq.(14) becomes

This equation is trivially satisﬁed by setting ρ = 0 and this is consistent with the fact that the origin is in itself an
orbit of Eqs.(6). Therefore, the integral curve associated with solitons is described by the vanishing of the expression
within the curly brackets. Requiring that this curve reaches the origin yields

where φ0 = φ(ρ = 0) and β2 has been obtained from Eq.(15). For γ = 1, the RHS of Eq.(A2) is positive so that
this equation can always be solved which, together with the fact that Eq.(7) is always satisﬁed for γ = 1, implies
that bright soliton exist in focusing media for any value of u0x. In the case γ =

APPENDIX B: APPENDIX B: CONDITIONS FOR DARK SOLITONS EXISTENCE

ﬁnd when they are also suﬃcient. From Eq.(17) (with γ =

Evaluating Eq.(B1) at ux = 0 and taking the square root of the result we obtain the second of Eqs.(19), which is

(i.e., with proving that the RHS of Eq.(B1) is a positive real number) and that such curves do not cross the ellipse
6u2
z = 1, thus leaving Eq.(7) satisﬁed. Since the expression under the square root is always positive for
u2

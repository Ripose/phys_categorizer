We describe an optical technique based on the statistical analysis of the random intensity distri-
bution due to the interference of the near-ﬁeld scattered light with the strong transmitted beam. It
is shown that, from the study of the two-dimensional power spectrum of the intensity, one derives
the scattered intensity as a function of the scattering wave vector. Near-ﬁeld conditions are speciﬁed
and discussed. The substantial advantages over traditional scattering technique are pointed out,
and is indicated that the technique could be of interest for wave lengths other than visible light.

Scattering techniques represent a powerful tool to probe the structure of matter. Syncrotron radiation, neutron
and light scattering allow to investigate phenomena occurring across a wide range of lengthscales, spanning from the
atomic one up to fractions of a millimeter. Scattering is used for the determination of the structure factor of liquids,
macromolecules, gels, porous materials and complex ﬂuids, by detecting the intensity IS (Θ) of the scattered radiation
in the far ﬁeld as a function of the scattering angle Θ. Each point in the far ﬁeld is illuminated by radiation coming
from diﬀerent portions of the sample, and the superposition of the scattered ﬁelds with random phases gives rise to
coherence areas (speckles) [1]. According to Van Cittert and Zernike theorem, the size and shape of the speckles in the
far ﬁeld is related to the intensity distribution of the probe beam. All the classical techniques rely on the measurement
of the average scattered intensity, and no physical information can be gained from the statistical analysis of the far
ﬁeld speckles.

In this paper we will describe a scattering technique based on the statistical analysis of the random intensity
modulation due to the interference of the strong transmitted beam and the near ﬁeld scattered light. We will show
that one can derive the scattered intensity distribution IS (Θ) from the two dimensional power spectrum of the
intensity ﬂuctuations. The Heterodyne technique is a more powerful and simpler alternative to the Homodyne Near
Field Scattering that we have recently presented [2, 3]. It oﬀers many substantial advantages over the homodyne
technique and the conventional small angle light scattering. There is no need of the rather awkward block of the
transmitted beam as in the homodyne case, and this makes the layout very simple and with no necessity of any
alignment.
It allows rigorous (static) stray light subtraction without any blank measurement. Also, being a self
referencing technique, it allows to determine absolute diﬀerential scattering cross sections. It also has a wide dynamic
range, since the signal depends on the amplitude of the scattered ﬁelds and not on the scattered intensities. Finally,
it gives much improved statistical accuracy. It is worth pointing out that in principle the technique can be used with
other type of scattering, like syncrotron or FEL radiation, or whenever coherence properties are adequate to generate
speckles.

The following discussion provides the rationale behind the heterodyne technique.
As in classical light scattering, we send a collimated laser beam with wave vector ~k0 through a sample, and our goal
is to measure IS (Q), the intensity of the light scattered at wave vector ~kS as a function of the transferred momentum
~Q = ~kS
~k0. In the technique presented here, this task is accomplished by measuring and analyzing the intensity
of light in a plane near the cell, in the forward scattering direction (see Fig. 1), perpendicular to the direction of

the incident beam, where the intense transmitted light acts as a reference beam interfering with the weak scattered
beams. Then, in the sensor plane [x, y], the intensity I (x, y) is the sum of the strong transmitted beam intensity
I0 and of the small modulations δI (x, y), due to the interference of the transmitted beam with the scattered beams
(heterodyne term); terms arising from the interference between scattered beams can be neglected (homodyne terms).
The intensity modulation δI (x, y), in the plane [x, y], can be decomposed in its Fourier components, with amplitude
δI (qx, qy). A modulation with wave vector [qx, qy] is generated by the interference of the transmitted beam with a
scattered three-dimensional plane wave with wave vector ~kS = [qx, qy, kz] or ~kS = [
qy, kz]. Both the waves
contribute to the heterodyne signal:

where δE (qx, qy, kz) and δE (
angles with respect to the direction of the probe beam. Because the scattering we are considering is elastic, the only
possible value of kz can be determined by imposing the condition
. We can thus
easily evaluate the modulus of the transferred wave vector Q, corresponding to the plane wave responsible for the
modulation of the intensity on the plane, with wave vector q:

which can be approximated by Q (q) = q, in the limit of small scattering angles. The scattered intensity IS (Q) is
simply related to the power spectrum SδI (q) of the intensity modulations in the detector plane. By taking the mean
square modulus of both sides of Eq. (1) we obtain:

In practice the measurement of the intensity modulations is implemented by using an array detector, which maps
the intensity as a function of position δI (x, y). The evaluation of SδI (q) can then be easily performed by a suitable
processing.

The distance z between the sample and the detector plane must meet two conditions, that we will discuss below.
Let us consider a sample whose diﬀraction halo is contained within an angle Θ∗. The detector is then hit by light
coming from a circular region of the sample with diameter D∗
zΘ∗. Equation (4) holds for the ideal case of an
inﬁnite incoming wave with inﬁnitely wide sample. In order for Eq. (4) to be valid for a ﬁnite size geometry, we must
have that D∗ is much smaller than the main beam diameter D that we assume of uniform intensity. The condition
then is z < D/Θ∗.

≈

We now discuss the second condition on z. Eq. (4) holds if δE (qx, qy, kz) and δE (

qy, kz) are not correlated.
A typical situation in which this does not happen is the case of the Raman-Nath scattering regime, where the sample
can be approximated as a two dimensional phase grating, and the ﬁelds scattered at symmetric angles do bear a
deﬁnite phase relation. Consequently the system shows the more complex behaviour described as the Talbot eﬀect
[1]. In particular, in spite of the fact that the grating scatters light at two symmetric angles, at periodic values of the
sensor distance z, the interference with the transmitted beam does not give rise to any intensity modulation. This is
the regime in which works the shadowgraph technique [4].

In order for the two ﬁelds not to be correlated, we must place the sensor not too close to the sample. Since the
detector area A is ﬁnite, the wave vectors [qx, qy] are discrete and correspond to the Fourier modes of A. Therefore,
each mode corresponds to a discrete scattering range of directions we can resolve. The light hitting the area A comes
from diﬀerent regions of the sample, one for each scattering direction. In order for the phase relations to vanish,
the distance z must be so large that the portion of the scattering volume feeding light scattered at [qx, qy, kz] to the
detector does not overlap with the portion of the scattering volume feeding light at [
qy, kz]. The resulting
condition is z > L2/λ, where L is the transverse dimension of the sensor, and λ is the wave length of the light used.

To evaluate the performances of the technique we have performed measurements on water suspensions of colloidal

latex particles; the wave vector range covered roughly two decades of q wave vectors.

The optical layout of the instrument is shown in Fig. 1. The collimated and spatially ﬁltered beam coming from a

CCD is an array of 768
576 square pixels each having a size of 8µm. The intensity distribution onto the CCD is a 20X
magniﬁed replica of the intensity of this pattern. The magniﬁcation has been selected so that the wave vector range
we want to measure corresponds to lengths between the pixel dimension and the sensor dimension. These magniﬁed
speckle patterns I (x, y) represent the raw data, from which the scattered intensity distribution IS (Q) can be derived
according to the the following procedure. First, a sequence of about 100 images is grabbed and stored. The images
are spaced in time so that the speckle ﬁelds in the images are statistically independent. This is achieved by grabbing
images at a frequency smaller than the smallest characteristic frequency of the sample, in our case DQ2
min, where D is
20cm−1
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the latex particles and Qmin is the smaller wave vector detected by the CCD (Q
for our setup). The time average ˜I (x, y) of the set of images is then subtracted from each image, and the result is
normalized by the spatial average I0 of ˜I (x, y):

Basically ˜I (x, y) represents an optical background due to the non-uniform illumination of the sample. This back-
ground is subtracted so to obtain the spatially ﬂuctuating part of the signal. The spectrum of the normalized
signal is then calculated from the Fast Fourier Transform of the normalized intensity by using Parseval’s relation,
2. After the azimuthal average of the power spectrum, the scattered intensity is ﬁnally obtained

from Eq. (4), where the wave vectors are rescaled according to Eq. (2).

Data obtained for the intensity scattered in the Mie regime by water suspension of latex colloidal particles are
presented in Fig. 2. The two data-set correspond to 5.2µm and 10µm diameter particles. The concentration was such
that the fraction of power of the probe beam removed due to scattering was of the order of a few percent, so that
the self-beating contribution of the scattered light is negligeable. Figure 2 also shows data obtained from the same
samples by using a state-of-the-art small-angle light scattering machine [5, 6] across two decades in wave vector. Data
from the heterodyne technique closely mirror those obtained by means of small angle light scattering.

We believe that visible light Heterodyne Near Field Scattering is a promising technique, particularly well suited
to replace the more traditional low angle light scattering. Typical applications will include colloids, aggregates,
particulate matter, aerosols, phase transitions and complex ﬂuids in general. Finally, we point out that X Ray sources
like the FEL should have fairly good coherence properties [7]. The required magniﬁcation to bring the X Ray speckle
size to realistic dimensions and larger than the available pixel sizes could be obtained by the use of properly diverging
beams (not discussed here) and long distances between the sample and the sensor.

The size of particles which can be trapped in optical tweezers ranges from tens of nanometres
to tens of micrometres. This size regime also includes large single molecules. Here we present
experiments demonstrating that optical tweezers can be used to collect polyethylene oxide (PEO)
molecules suspended in water. The molecules that accumulate in the focal volume do not aggregate
and therefore represent a region of increased molecule concentration, which can be controlled by
the trapping potential. We also present a model which relates the change in concentration to the
trapping potential. Since many protein molecules have molecular weights for which this method is
applicable the eﬀect may be useful in assisting nucleation of protein crystals.

Optical tweezers can trap and manipulate micrometer
sized particles, and a variety of applications in physics,
chemistry and biology have been explored [1, 2]. The un-
derlying principle is photon momentum transfer which,
for a tightly focussed laser beam, results in the creation
of a three-dimensional trapping potential [3]. The depth
of the optically induced trapping potential is determined
by, among other parameters, the polarizability of the
trapped object and the intensity of the laser beam. The
polarizability of a Rayleigh particle scales with its vol-
ume [4]. Since trapping of a particle requires a trap-
ping potential which is suﬃciently larger than the ther-
mal energy of the particle, there is a minimum size of
particle that can be trapped. Trapping of solid parti-
cles with sizes down to tens of nanometres has been re-
ported [4, 5]. Also aggregation of polymer chains with
radii of gyration in this size regime in an optical ﬁeld has
been observed [6]. However, there are important ther-
modynamic diﬀerences between the trapping of particles
that aggregate and particles that do not—in the latter
case, the partial pressure due to the trapped particles
increases as the concentration increases, while in the for-
mer, the number density does not increase. The trapping
of large macromolecules has been demonstrated [7, 8], in
this case DNA molecules of ≈ 100, 000 kDa, but there
do not seem to have been any studies of the trapping of
non-aggregrating molecules of sizes spanning the limits
of what can be trapped, which is orders of magnitude
smaller than this.

Here we report on experiments carried out with PEO
molecules of diﬀerent molecular weight (Sigma Aldrich,
USA, mw = 100 kDa, 300 kDa, 900 kDa). We show that
the concentration of molecules within the trapping region
can be controlled and reversibly changed by the trapping
power. We also show that only molecules above a certain
molecular weight can be trapped.

FIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the experimental setup. The
ytterbium ﬁber laser was used to create the trapping potential
while the local increase in the molecule concentration was
monitored by collecting the scattered light of the collinear He-
Ne laser. A beam block in the detection beam path increased
the sensitivity of the detection system.

To create the trapping potential we used a standard
tweezers setup, based on an inverted microscope (see ﬁg-
ure 1), where the CW trapping laser (ytterbium ﬁber
laser, 1064 nm, IPG, USA) was coupled into a 100×,

creased exponentially, as the ﬁt with a function of the
type S = S0 · (1 − e−t/τ ) showed.

NA=1.25 objective (Olympus, Japan) and brought to a
focus in the liquid containing the PEO molecules. The
power of the trapping laser was varied between 0 and
0.7 W in the object plane. The temperature of the sam-
ple slide and the objective were kept constant using ther-
moelectric coolers.

To monitor the eﬀects of the trapping potential on the
PEO molecules a low power He-Ne laser (JDS Uniphase,
USA) was aligned collinearly with the trapping laser
beam, and focused onto the same position. The increased
concentration of the initially homogeneously dispersed
molecules in the focal region is associated with a higher
index of refraction – as compared to the surrounding wa-
ter – and thus resulted in scattering of the He-Ne light.
To further increase the sensitivity of the setup we blocked
the central portion of the He-Ne reﬂection, allowing only
rays which are scattered at angles larger than those of the
incident beam to reach the CCD camera. For this pur-
pose the incident He-Ne laser beam did not ﬁll the back
aperture of the objective, thus a beam block between
the dichroic mirror and the CCD camera could be used
to discriminate between light reﬂected from the glass sur-
faces and the light scattered from the probe volume. The
scattered light was monitored with a CCD camera, and
its intensity was quantiﬁed using a MATLAB program
evaluating the corresponding pixels.

The PEO was dissolved in deionized water and the
whole sample was heated up to 50◦C for several days
prior to use to ensure that the molecules were completely
dissolved. The radii of gyration of the respective PEO
molecules in water together with the respective overlap
concentrations and the concentrations actually used are
listed in table 1 [9, 10, 11]. The diﬀerent sample solu-
tions all had the same number density of dissolved PEO
molecules (≈ 300µm−3). The corresponding PEO con-
centrations in the diﬀerent samples were all well below
the overlap concentration, thus the PEO molecules could
be treated as single particles.

Since the power of the detection laser was kept con-
stant for all measurements (PHeNe = 2 mW), the scat-
tered light intensity was a measure of the increase of the
concentration in the focal region. A trapping potential
created by the ﬁber laser typically caused an increase
of the intensity of the scattered light until it eventually
reached a stable value (see ﬁgure 2). This value repre-
sented the steady-state equilibrium concentration for the
given potential. The intensity of the scattered light in-

FIG. 2: Typical time series of the scattered He-Ne light in-
tensity (in arbitrary units) as a result of the concentration
increase due to a trapping potential created by the trapping
laser (switched on at t=0). The solid line shows a ﬁt curve
using the function S = S0 · (1 − e−t/τ ).

The typical timescales to reach the steady-state con-
centration were in the order of minutes, depending on
trapping power. The long timescales rule out the possi-
bility that the light scattering is caused by a temperature
induced change of the refractive index of the medium,
since temperature eﬀects due to heating would occur in
milliseconds [12].

To demonstrate that the molecule concentration could
be increased reversibly the trapping power was changed
stepwise (ﬁgure 3(a)). Laser powers above a threshold
power resulted in an increase of the concentration of the
molecules in the focal volume, whereas trapping laser
powers below the respective threshold power led the scat-
tered light intensity to decrease to zero. This thresh-
old behavior is similar to the switch–on behavior of the
current–voltage characteristic of a diode. As for diodes,
the relation is in fact exponential, which means that for
trapping potentials above a certain threshold — the ther-
mal energy — the concentration increases dramatically.
The intensity of the scattered He-Ne laser light de-
pends on unknown parameters, like the elastic scatter-
ing properties of the PEO molecules. Thus the scat-
tered light can not directly be used to quantify the con-
centration in the focal volume. Nevertheless, the in-
tensity of the scattered light is a measure of the rela-
tive concentration change, and by ﬁtting the experimen-
tally obtained intensities with the mentioned exponential
function, time-constants as a function of trapping laser
powers could be obtained. The reciprocal of the time-
constant τ can be called a collection rate, which we de-
note by R.

the trapping power used for PEO molecules with molecu-

mw = 300 kDa and an initial PEO concentration of 0.027
wt %, the trapping laser powers in the diﬀerent sections
(I-VII) were: 0.58 W-0.10 W-0.60 W-0.10 W-0.64 W-0.10 W-
0.7 W. (b) Summary of collection rates R for PEO with molec-

data points at 0.1W give the reciprocal of the time–constants
for the diﬀusion–driven decrease extracted from (d). (c) In-
crease of He-Ne light intensity for diﬀerent laser powers (taken
from (a)), ﬁtted with S = S0 · (1 − e−t/τ ). (d) For laser pow-
ers below the threshold the He-Ne light intensities decreased
exponentially with time.

lar weight mw = 300 kDa and mw = 900 kDa is plotted in
ﬁgure 3(b). For laser powers which cause an increase of
the concentration the collection rate R increases with the
power of the trapping laser (ﬁgure 3(c)). From ﬁgure 3(b)
the threshold trapping power for the respective molecular
weight (in this case for mw = 300 kDa) could be extrap-
olated. We deﬁned the threshold power for the diﬀerent
molecular weight PEO molecules at the intersection of
the ﬁtted straight line with the x-axis. The threshold for
the molecules with mw = 900 kDa is P ≈ 0.29 W, and for
mw = 300 kDa is P ≈ 0.53 W.

As expected, the higher the molecular weight of the
PEO molecules the lower the threshold trapping powers
needed to conﬁne the molecules. For PEO molecules with
a molecular weight of mw = 100 kDa the concentration
of the molecules could not be increased to a detectable
level (using laser powers of up to 0.7 W).

If the laser power was below the threshold for the re-
spective PEO molecules, the decrease of the scattered
He-Ne light intensities had the same time-constants (in-
dependent of the scattered light intensity at the steady-
state concentration). The time-constants for the mw =
900 kDa PEO molecules were slightly larger than the ones
for the mw = 300 kDa molecules. This is consistent
with theory which predicts smaller diﬀusion-coeﬃcients

3

for larger particles. This can be attributed to the fact
that for laser powers below the threshold the decrease
of the concentration of molecules in the focal volume is
solely driven by diﬀusion. Thus the time-constants for
the decrease are independent of the initial concentration.
This is in contrast to the increase of molecule concen-
tration which dependents on the trapping potential, and
consequently the time-constant depends on the trapping
power.

Our ﬁnding that the time-constant depends on the
trapping power is consistent with a calculation of the
achievable trapping potential for a particle in a laser
beam with a Gaussian intensity proﬁle. Since the indi-
vidual molecules are much smaller than the wavelength
of the trapping laser the gradient force

can be calculated using Rayleigh scattering, where ~S is
the Poynting vector, and the other symbols have their
usual meaning [5, 13]. The quasi-static polarizability α of
a non-magnetic dielectric sphere of radius r and refractive
index n, immersed in a medium of refractive index nm is
given by [13]

where nr = n/nm denotes the relative refractive index.
A comparison of the gyration radii of PEO in water with
the stretched chain lengths [14] (lc ≈ 2.4 µm for 300 kDa,
and ≈ 7.2 µm for 900 kDa) of the PEO molecules shows
that the individual molecules can be approximated as
spheres with gyration radii rg. A subsequent integration
of the gradient force over the beam proﬁle

gives the trapping potential. Since the gradient force is
proportional to the intensity gradient, the trapping po-
tential at any point is simply proportional to the intensity
at this point.

In order to trap a particle the trapping potential needs
to be larger than the mean thermal energy kT of the par-
ticle. On this account we calculated a contour for which
the particle has to overcome a potential of kT to escape
the trap. This contour is associated with a certain surface
area, and this surface area increases with the trapping
power. The increase is due to the fact that for higher
laser powers a potential depth of kT is already created
at larger distances from the focal point.

The extension of the ‘kT ’ surface area with the laser
power is reﬂected by the decreased time-constant nec-
essary to reach the steady-state intensity. This can be
illustrated by visualizing the equi-intensity contour as an
event horizon, which has a larger surface area for higher
laser powers, and a smaller for lower powers. The event

horizon divides the liquid into a region where particles
can freely diﬀuse, and a region (the volume inside of the
contour) where the particles remain trapped, once they
have entered this region (by diﬀusion). Since the poten-
tial of the trap outside of this event horizon is too small
to attract particles the trap can only be loaded by pas-
sive diﬀusion of the particles suspended in the surround-
ing liquid. Particles which diﬀuse through the mentioned
surface area get trapped in the focal volume. Since those
particles can no longer diﬀuse out of the trap, the con-
centration in the focal volume increases with time. Since
the area of the surface determines how many particles per
time diﬀuse through it, it directly determines the initial
collection rate.

If the trapping power is below the threshold, the par-
ticles can diﬀuse out of the trap. The time-constant for
the diﬀusion out of the trap is (for Utrap ≪ kT ) is only
determined by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the particles in
the liquid.

FIG. 4: Calculated surface area of the equi-potential contour
of the trap for a potential depth of kT for diﬀerent molecular
weight PEO molecules. The dash-dotted line gives the surface
area of the event horizon for PEO molecules with molecular
weight of 900 kDa, the dotted line for 300 kDa, and the solid
line is for 100 kDa.

The thermal energy of a molecule does not depend on
its molecular weight. Consequently, the threshold trap-
ping potential necessary for stable trapping is indepen-
dent of the molecular weight. However, since the achiev-
able trapping potential for a given trapping laser power
does depend on the molecular weight, molecules with dif-
ferent molecular weight (and therefore diﬀerent polar-
izabilities, see eqn.
(2)) have diﬀerent threshold trap-
ping powers, as conﬁrmed by both our experiments (ﬁg.
(3b)) and our calculations (ﬁg. 4). Both our results and
calculations also show that for the trapping powers we
used (P < 0.7 W) the achievable trapping potential for
molecules with molecular weight of mw = 100 kDa was
not suﬃcient to stably conﬁne these molecules.

While it is tempting to conclude that the qualitative

4

agreement between theoretical expectations and our ob-
servations allow us to deﬁnitively identify optical trap-
ping as the mechanism responsible for the increase in
concentration of PEO molecules, it is important to rule
out other possible mechanisms that might contribute.
For example, the combination of convection and ther-
mophoresis was used to Braun and Libchaber [15] to
trap DNA. It should be noted that the geometry used
by Braun and Libchaber diﬀers signiﬁcantly from ours
— their trapping occurred in the bottom 5 µm of their
sample chamber, while in our experiments, the molecules
are trapped in a volume of approximately 1 µm × 1 µm
× 3 µm located 60 µm above the bottom of our sample
chamber (which had a total depth of 500 µm). Therefore,
the interaction between convection, thermophoresis, and
the chamber ﬂoor that allowed trapping by Braun and
Libchaber cannot occur in our experiment. As both the
objective and sample slide in our experiment were main-
tained at a constant temperature, the only heating would
be in the vicinity of the focus, which is where we observed
the increase in concentration. Noting that the Soret co-
eﬃcient of PEO in water is positive [16], thermophore-
sis would oppose trapping, and can be discounted as a
mechanism responsible for trapping — in the absence of
the three-way interaction between temperature gradient,
convection, and chamber bottom, thermophoresis alone
would act to reduce the concentration.

We can estimate an upper limit to convective ﬂow in
the trap. At the maximum power we had available, the
expected temperature rise, not accounting for the ef-
fect of cooling the sample slide or objective, would be
13 K [17]. As this heating is localised in the focal re-
gion, we can approximate it as a uniformly heated sphere
of water, surrounded by cooler water. Over-estimating
(since we shall be content with an upper limit) the size
of such as sphere as 10 µm in diameter, the net upward
force due to the reduced density is 0.019 pN, which will be
in equilibrium with viscous drag at a speed of 0.2 µm/s.
The actual ﬂow speed is likely to be much slower (for
example, assuming a diameter of 5 µm, also still an over-
estimate, gives a speed of 0.06 µm/s). In any case, con-
vective ﬂow would be fastest in the focal volume of the
trap, and act against trapping by pulling particles out of
the trap through viscous drag. It is possible that convec-
tive ﬂow might deliver PEO molecules to the trap, but
unless the optical gradient force can exceed the drag, the
molecules will not be trapped.

As both thermophoresis and convection can be ruled
out as causes of the trapping we observed, this leaves op-
tical gradient forces as by far the most likely mechanism
at work. Thus we can, with conﬁdence, state that we
have optically trapped the PEO molecules.

We have shown that using optical tweezers it is possi-
ble to locally increase the molecule concentration of large
molecules. We propose that this method could be used
to assist nucleation of protein crystals.
In contrast to
conventional methods—where nucleation is triggered by
changing the properties of the whole growing medium—

the suggested tweezers-assisted nucleation would favor
the creation of only one nucleation site in the entire solu-
tion. The ability to aﬀect molecules increases with molec-
ular weight. Crystals of large proteins are especially dif-
ﬁcult to grow, and their structure cannot be analyzed
using alternative methods like NMR [18]. For smaller
protein molecules, alternatively, the concentration of a

large molecular weight precipitant could be increased,
which results in a lower saturation concentration of the
respective proteins.

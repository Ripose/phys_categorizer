Abstract. The propagation of plane waves in a Faraday chiral medium is investigated. Condi-
tions for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to the direction of power ﬂow are derived for
propagation in an arbitrary direction; simpliﬁed conditions which apply to propagation parallel to
the distinguished axis are also established. These negative phase–velocity conditions are explored
numerically using a representative Faraday chiral medium, arising from the homogenization of an
isotropic chiral medium and a magnetically biased ferrite. It is demonstrated that the phase velocity
may be directed opposite to power ﬂow, provided that the gyrotropic parameter of the ferrite com-
ponent medium is suﬃciently large compared with the corresponding nongyrotropic permeability
parameters.

Introduction

Homogeneous mediums which support the propagation of waves with phase velocity directed op-
posite to the direction of power ﬂow have attracted much attention lately [1, 2, 3]. The archetypal
example of such a medium is the isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium with simultaneously nega-
tive real permittivity and negative real permeability scalars, as ﬁrst described Veselago in the late
1960s [4]. A range of exotic and potentially useful electromagnetic phenomenons, such as negative
refraction, inverse Doppler shift, and inverse ˘Cerenkov radiation, were predicted for this type of
medium [3, 4]. Recent experimental studies involving the microwave illumination of certain com-
posite metamaterials [5, 6] — which followed on from earlier works of Pendry et al. [7, 8] — are
supportive of Veselago’s predictions and have prompted an intensiﬁcation of interest in this area.

In particular, a general condition — applicable to dissipative isotropic dielectric–magnetic medi-
ums — has been derived for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to power ﬂow [9]; and this
condition shows that the real parts of both the permittivity and the permeability scalars do not
have to be negative.

A consensus has yet to be reached on terminology. For the present purposes, a medium support-
ing wave propagation with phase velocity directed opposite to power ﬂow is most aptly referred to
as a negative phase–velocity medium. However, the reader is alerted that alternative terms, such as
left–handed material [3], backward medium [10], double–negative medium [1], and negative–index
medium [11], are also in circulation. A discussion of this issue is available elsewhere [12].

The scope for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to power ﬂow may be greatly ex-
tended by considering non–isotropic mediums, as has been indicated by considerations of uniaxial
dielectric–magnetic mediums [10, 13, 14]. The focus of the present communication is the propa-
gation of negative phase–velocity plane waves in Faraday chiral mediums (FCMs) [15, 16]. These
mediums combine natural optical activity — as exhibited by isotropic chiral mediums [17] — with
Faraday rotation — as exhibited by gyrotropic mediums [18, 19, 20]. A FCM may be theoretically
conceptualized as a homogenized composite medium (HCM) arising from the blending together of
an isotropic chiral medium with either a magnetically biased ferrite [21] or a magnetically biased
plasma [22]. The HCM component mediums are envisioned as random particulate distributions.
The homogenization process is justiﬁed provided that the particulate length scales in the mixture
of components are small compared with electromagnetic wavelengths. A vast literature on the esti-
mation of constitutive parameters of HCMs exists; see Refs. [23, 24], for example. The constitutive
relations of FCMs have been rigorously established for some time [16], although inappropriate use
still occurs [25].

In the following sections, wavenumbers and corresponding electric ﬁeld phasors are delineated
from eigenvalue/vector analysis for planewave propagation in an arbitrary direction. Simpli-
ﬁed expressions for these quantities are derived for propagation parallel to the biasing (quasi)–
magnetostatic ﬁeld [19, p. 71]. A general condition for the phase velocity to be directed opposite
to power ﬂow is established. The theoretical analysis is illustrated by means of a representative
numerical example: the constitutive parameters of FCMs arising from a speciﬁc homogenization
scenario are estimated and then used to explore the wave propagation characteristics.

As regards notation, vectors are underlined whereas dyadics are double underlined. All electro-
magnetic ﬁeld phasors and constitutive parameters depend implicitly on the circular frequency
ω of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Unit vectors are denoted by the superscript ˆ symbol, while
I = ˆx ˆx + ˆy ˆy + ˆz ˆz is the identity dyadic. The complex conjugate of a quantity q is written as
q∗; the real part of q is written as Re
. The free–space (i.e., vacuum) wavenumber is denoted
}
by k0 = ω√ǫ0µ0 where ǫ0 and µ0 are the permittivity and permeability of free space, respectively;
and η0 =

µ0/ǫ0 represents the intrinsic impedance of free space.

2 Analysis

2.1 Preliminaries

The propagation of plane waves with ﬁeld phasors

in a FCM is considered. Such a medium is characterized by the frequency–domain constitutive
relations [16]

with constitutive dyadics

E(r) = E0 exp(ik0˜k ˆu • r)
H(r) = H 0 exp(ik0˜k ˆu • r) )

Thus, the distinguished axis of the FCM is chosen to be the z axis. For FCMs which arise as
HCMs, the gyrotropic parameters ǫg, ξg and µg in (3) develop due to the gyrotropic properties of
the ferrite or plasma component mediums. Parenthetically, it is remarked that more general FCMs
can develop through the homogenization of component mediums based on nonspherical particulate
geometries [22, 26].

In general, the relative wavenumber ˜k in (1) is complex valued; i.e.,

It may be calculated from the planewave dispersion relation

In the remainder of this section, the quantity ˜kR ˆu • P (r) is derived for planewave propagation
in an arbitrary direction; without loss of generality, ˆu is taken to lie in the xz plane (i.e., ˆu =
ˆx sin θ + ˆz cos θ). Further manipulations reveal the simple form ˜kR ˆu • P (r) adopts for propagation
along the FCM distinguished axis (i.e., ˆu = ˆz).

Hence, four relative wavenumbers ˜k = κi, κii, κiii and κiv may be extracted — either algebraically
or numerically [27] — as the roots of (10).

3 Numerical results

let us consider a Faraday chiral medium (FCM) produced by mixing (a) an isotropic chiral medium
described by the constitutive relations [17]

Incidentally, a FCM with constitutive dyadics of the form (39) may also be developed via the
homogenization of an isotropic chiral medium and a magnetically biased plasma [22].

The constitutive dyadics ǫHCM , ξHCM and µHCM are estimated using the Bruggeman homoge-
nization formalism for a representative example. Comprehensive details of the Bruggeman formal-
ism [28, 24] and its implementation in the context of FCMs [21, 22, 29] are available elsewhere.
Initially, we restrict our attention to nondissipative FCMs; the inﬂuence of dissipation is considered
later in this section.

3.1 Nondissipative FCMs

The parameter values selected for nondissipative component mediums are as follows:

ǫa = 3.2, ξa = 2.4, µa = 2; ǫb = 2.2, µb = 3.5, µb

z = 1, µb

g ∈

[0, 4].

The permeability parameters for component medium b may be viewed in terms of the semi–classical
ferrite model as

(40)

wherein ω0 is the Larmor precessional frequency of spinning electrons and ωm is the saturated
magnetization frequency [18, 19]. Thus, the parameter values µb = 3.5 and µb
[0, 4] correspond
to the relative frequency range (ω0/ω)

[0.625,

g ∈

).

Let fa denote the volume fraction of the isotropic chiral component medium a.
In ﬁgure 1,
the estimated constitutive parameters of the HCM are plotted as functions of fa for µb
g = 4. The
uniaxial and gyrotropic characteristics of a FCM are clearly reﬂected by the constituents of the
permeability dyadic µHCM and the magnetoelectric dyadic ξHCM . In contrast, the HCM is close
to being isotropic with respect to its dielectric properties. Signiﬁcantly, eight of the nine scalars
appearing in (39) are positive, while ǫHCM

3.2 Dissipative FCMs

The scope of these numerical investigations is now broadened by considering (i) the eﬀects of
dissipation or loss; and (ii) propagation in an arbitrary direction. Let a small amount of loss be
incorporated into component medium b by selecting the constitutive parameters of the component
mediums as

ǫa = 3.2, ξa = 2.4, µa = 2; ǫb = 2.2 + i δ, µb = 3.5 + i δ, µb

z = 1 + i 0.5δ, µb

g = 4 + i 2δ,

where the dissipation parameter δ
[0, 0.2]. We focus attention on the region of negative phase–
velocity propagation along the z axis with relative wavenumber κiv, as illustrated by wiv < 0 at
0.25 < fa < 0.42 in ﬁgure 4.

∈

Real parts of the relative wavenumber κiv, calculated at the volume fraction fa = 0.35 with
δ = 0, 0.1 and 0.2, are graphed as functions of θ in ﬁgure 7. The relative wavenumber κiv for the
nondissipative FCM (i.e., δ = 0) is real–valued for θ < 52◦ but has a nonzero imaginary part for
θ > 52◦. The relative wavenumbers κiv for δ = 0.1 and 0.2 have nonzero imaginary parts for all
values of θ. Note that the real part of κiv falls to zero at θ = π/2 in the absence of dissipation (i.e.,
δ = 0).

Plots of the quantity w = wiv, corresponding to the relative wavenumber κiv of ﬁgure 7, are

provided in ﬁgure 8. The negative phase–velocity condition wiv < 0 is satisﬁed

(i) for θ < 52◦ when δ = 0,

(ii) for θ < 76◦ when δ = 0.1, and

(iii) for θ < 38◦ when δ = 0.2.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

In isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums, plane waves can propagate with phase velocity directed
opposite to the direction of power ﬂow under certain, rather restrictive, conditions [9]. However,
the constitutive parameter space associated with anisotropic and bianisotropic mediums provides
a wealth of opportunities for observing and exploiting negative phase–velocity behavior. Gen-
eral conditions are established here for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to power ﬂow
for a particular class of bianisotropic mediums, namely Faraday chiral mediums. The theory has
been explored by means of a representative example of FCMs, arising from the homogenization
of an isotropic chiral medium and a magnetically biased ferrite. For our representative example,
the negative phase–velocity conditions have been found to hold for propagation in arbitrary direc-
tions — for both nondissipative and dissipative FCMs — provided that the gyrotropic parameter of
the ferrite component medium is suﬃciently large compared with the corresponding nongyrotropic
permeability parameters.

Previous studies [1]–[13] have emphasized the importance of the signs of constitutive (scalar)
parameters in establishing the conditions for negative phase–velocity propagation in homogeneous

10

mediums.2 In the absence of dissipation, negative phase–velocity propagation has been predicted
in

(i) isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums provided that both the permittivity and permeability

scalars are negative [3], and

[10].

(ii) uniaxial dielectric–magnetic mediums when only one of the four constitutive scalars is negative

Also, the conditions for negative phase–velocity propagation may be fulﬁlled by dissipative isotropic
dielectric–magnetic mediums when only one of the two constitutive scalars has a negative real part
[9]. The present study demonstrates that the condition for negative phase–velocity propagation can
be satisﬁed by nondissipative FCMs with constitutive scalars that are all positive. Furthermore,
these conditions continue to be satisﬁed after the introduction a small amount of dissipation.

For the particular case of propagation parallel to the ferrite biasing ﬁeld, the components of
the time–averaged Poynting vector are null–valued in directions perpendicular to the propagation
direction. In contrast, for general propagation directions, the time–averaged Poynting vector has
nonzero components perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Further studies are required to
explore the consequences of the negative phase–velocity condition ˜kR ˆu • P (r) < 0 for such general
propagation directions.

To conclude, more general bianisotropic mediums, particularly those developed as HCMs based
on nonspherical particulate components, oﬀer exciting prospects for future studies of negative
phase–velocity propagation.

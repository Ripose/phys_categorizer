Abstract

By using perturbation theory we derive an expression for the elec-
trical ﬁeld of a Gaussian laser pulse propagating in a gas medium.
This expression is used as a trial solution in a variational method to
get quasianalytical solutions for the width, intensity and self-focusing
distance of ultrashort pulse. The approximation gives an improved
agreement with results of numerical simulations for a broad range of
values of the input power of the pulse than previous analytical results
available in the literature.

1 Introduction

The propagation of high-peak power femtosecond laser pulses in optical me-
dia has attracted considerable attention recently [1, 2]. These pulses undergo
dramatic changes in their temporal, spatial and spectral properties due to
their nonlinear interaction with the medium. The most fundamental process
is self-focusing which causes the pulse to be compressed in space, result-
ing in an increase of the peak intensity [3]. Self-focusing would result in
a catastrophic collapse of the pulse, but the self-focusing process is usually
balanced by multiphoton ionization or excitation of the atoms or molecules
in the medium, since the resulting (quasi-)free electron density defocuses the
pulse.

The analysis of optical pulse propagation is usually based on the de-
scription of the pulse in terms of its complex ﬁeld envelope, neglecting the
underlying rapid oscillations at its carrier frequency. The resulting slowly

1

varying envelope approximation reduces the Maxwell’s equations to higher
dimensional nonlinear Sch¨odinger equations (NLSE). These equations are
not integrable, so they do not have soliton solutions. However, they possess
stationary solutions which are unstable on propagation. The self-focusing
distance is determined as the (ﬁrst) point of inﬁnite intensity in the solution
of the NLSE.

Most of the quantitative analysis of self-focusing (and further propaga-
tion) of the pulse results from numerical computation. For example, from a
curve-ﬁtting procedure based on numerical simulations a popular analytical
formula for the location of the ﬁrst singularity (self-focusing distance) for the
propagation of a CW laser beam has been given by Dawes and Marburger
[4, 3]:

0/2πn0n2, with λ0 is the wavelength and n0 and n2 are
the linear and nonlinear indices of refraction, respectively [5]. Formula (1)
has been veriﬁed in many experiments and numerical simulations. Besides
its accurateness and usefulness for estimations it however does not give much
insight in the physics of the underlying process.

In order to get a deeper insight into a physical process, it is often useful
to use approximative theories, even if full numerical solutions are available.
A few approximations have been discussed already in the early review pa-
per on self-focusing by Marburger [3]. The resulting expressions provide,
however, rather qualitative than quantitative estimations only. Alternative
approaches have been proposed to analyze the eﬀect of self-focusing, namely
a systematic perturbation theory [6, 7], a ray-equation approximation [3], an
approach based on Fermat’s principle [8], a variational analysis [9], a paraxial
parabolic approximation [10], or a source-dependent expansion method [11].
The predictions of these models for the self-focusing distance agree quanti-
tatively well with the exact solutions from numerical simulations for input
powers close to the critical power, but deviate quickly as the power increases.
In this paper we present a quasianalytical approximation which provides
a description of the self-focusing phenomenon not only qualitatively but also
quantitatively. It is based on the variational approach using a trial solution,
which contains a ﬁrst-order perturbation correction of the phase resulting
from the transverse distortion of the pulse. As we show below, predictions
for the self-focusing distance, the on-axis peak intensity and the radius of
the pulse within this ansatz are in better agreement with those of numeri-
cal simulations over a broad range of input powers than previous analytical

2

results available in the literature. We show how the pulse separates into an
inner and an outer self-trapped component along the propagation distance.
The inner component self-focus, while the outer one stays as background.

The paper is organized as follows: First, we derive the phase correction
of the pulse using ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. The corrected form of
the pulse is then used as trial solution in the Lagrangian of the system to
obtain equations for the self-focusing distance, the on-axis peak intensity
and the radius of the pulse. Next, the predictions of the approximation will
be compared with those of the earlier models and of numerical simulations.
Finally, an analogy with the problem of a particle in a ﬁnite quantum well
is presented. In this analogy, the bound state and its exponential-decaying
wings penetrating a smooth potential wall correspond to the inner and outer
component of the pulse, respectively. The self-focusing is associated with the
shrinking of the width of the quantum well.

2 Variational approach

We study the propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam in gases. For the
explicit calculations we do not restrict to any speciﬁc gas. Our analysis is
based on the scalar wave equation, which can be obtained from the Maxwell
equations (e.g. [8]):

∂2

ǫ0
c2 ∂2

t E =

4πχ(3)
c2

−

t E3 +
∂2

4π
c2 ∂tJ.

(2)

Here, χ(3) is the third order nonlinear susceptibility coeﬃcient of the medium,
ǫ0 is the linear dielectric constant of the gas and c is the speed of light.
Since we are interested in the dynamics of the pulse up to the self-focusing
distance only, we neglect the plasma eﬀects (J = 0), which usually balance
the catastrophic collapse and, hence, inﬂuence mainly the propagation of
the pulse after the self-focusing point. Using the slowly varying envelope
approximation, Eq.
(2) can be written in the retarded coordinate frame

2.1 Phase correction

The variational method has been applied to the (2+1)-dimensional NLSE
recently [9] to study qualitatively the phenomenon of self-focusing in air. As
mentioned at the outset the method is as good as the trial solution. Usually
the self-similarity assumption is used in order to integrate over the transversal
coordinates taking into account that the total power of the NLSE is invariant.
This is done by assuming that the shape of the pulse remains unchanged up
to the self-focusing point. The assumption preserves the lens transformation

4

of the NLSE. However, from numerical simulations one can observe that the
initial pulse shape gets distorted during the self-focusing process (c.f. Fig. 1).
In fact, the pulse separates into two components as it propagates [7],

u(ξ, r) = ψ0(ξ, r) + ǫψ1(ξ, r),

(5)

where ψ0 is the high intensity inner core of the pulse, which self-focuses and
ǫψ1 is the low intensity outer part, which propagates forward following the
linear propagation mode. In recent experiments and numerical simulations
[12, 13, 14, 15] it has been shown that this weak large background plays a
decisive role in the propagation and ﬁlamentation process.

We expect that the self-focusing process is inﬂuenced by the interaction
between the inner core and the outer part too. To this end we use a trial
solution in the variational method, in which the perturbation by the back-
ground is taken into account as a correction in the phase. We ﬁrst separate
amplitude and phase of the pulse as:

The desired trial solution is then given by

with S1(0, r) = 0. Here the amplitude corrections of order ǫ have been
neglected, while phase corrections have been kept. Note that u(ξ, r) still

We do not consider the presence of any external perturbation, like losses or
ionization. However, the theory presented here can be extended considering
these terms following the same lines as in [9]. We have checked carefully that
the predictions of the numerical calculations for the self-focusing distance do
vary by less than 1%, if we include external perturbations. Other properties,
such as the pulse length or the on-axis intensity (up to the self-focusing point)
are even less sensitive to these eﬀects. It is therefore justiﬁed, for the sake of
simplicity, to neglect external perturbations.

2.2 The Gaussian pulse shape

As outlined above, the phase correction can be obtained for any shape of
the pulse. In order to investigate the eﬀect we apply the theory to the most
important case of a Gaussian pulse shape below. In this case

ψ0(ξ, r) =

exp (ρ2) exp (i b0 a(ξ) ρ2),

(15)

A
a(ξ)

where ρ = r/a(ξ) and b0 is a constant describing the initial wave front di-
vergence of the pulse (i.e. b0 = 0 for collimated pulse, or b0 =
1/f for the
case of an external lens with focal length f ), we obtain the phase correction
from the solution of Eq. (13),

which is proportional to the excess power, as long as the excess power is
small. With this relation one is able to solve the integral (8) in terms of β for
Gaussian pulses. However, the solution of the integral is ill-posed, since the
integrals in the solution diverge. Therefore, we have adopted an adiabatic
approximation instead, namely that the transverse form of n1(ξ, r) remains
unaﬀected along the propagation distance, i.e

shown using the variational method (see Appendix A). Thus, ﬁnally we get

3 Results and comparisons

Below we present the predictions of the present theoretical ansatz and com-
pare them with those of other semi-analytical estimations and the results of
numerical calculations using Eq. (4). The comparisons are performed for the
case of a collimated Gaussian pulse without external focusing. We should
note that this is the most extreme case. The presence of a ﬁnite external
focusing reduces the relative errors between the theory and simulations.

First, we concentrate on the results of the present ansatz for the self-
focusing distance, ξsf (c.f. Eq. (36)). In Fig. 2 the relative error (solid line),

with respect to Marburger’s formula, Eq. (1), is shown as a function of the
input power (scaled in units of the critical power). Note that Eq. (1) has
been derived from numerical simulations and is, hence, an excellent estimate
of the exact self-focusing distance. The comparison shows that the relative
error is largest (about 40%) for input powers close to the critical power and

theory (see Eq. (41)) or by more than 100% in the case of other theories
(see Eq. (40)), while the present theoretical prediction agree within about
20% with Marburger’s formula. We attribute this to the phase correction
obtained from the interaction with the weak large background, which has
not been taken into account in the earlier work. In fact, from our ansatz we
observe that the background does not diﬀract and receives energy from the
inner part of the pulse during the self-focusing process, as we will discuss
below in Section 4. We also mention that the expression in Eq. (40) for
the self-focusing can be obtained by taking into account the two ﬁrst leading
(26) only. This
terms of the power series of the phase correction in Eq.
means that the earlier ansatz (see for instance [9]) is a limiting case of Eqs.
(25) and (26).

We ﬁnd also that the estimations of the present theory and the numerical
simulations for the pulse length and the on-axis intensity agree within 30%.
In Fig. 3 a comparison of the pulse length a(ξ), Eq. (34) (solid line), and the
1/e2-level width of the intensity proﬁle using numerical simulation (dashed
line) of a collimated Gaussian pulse for diﬀerent input powers is shown.

Since the range of values of the ordinate in Fig. 3 is the same (but not
those of the abscissa) we have evaluated an relative error using the inverse
functions,

4 Quantum well analogy

−

In order to further understand the role of the weak large background on the
dynamics of the pulse, we have investigated our ansatz using the quantum
well analogy. In this picture ξ acts as a ﬁctitious time variable, u(ξ, r) as a
φ′(ξ) as the energy function of the system. By substitut-
bound state and
ing Eq. (25) into Eq. (4) and taking the real part, one ﬁnds an equation for
φ′(ξ). If we neglect the diﬀraction part of this equation (neglecting kinetic
−
energy in the quantum analogue), it is straight forward to derive a potential-
like function. In Fig. 5 the normalized shape of this potential is compared
with the normalized shape of the intensity proﬁle of the pulse obtained from
numerical simulations. We observe that the shape of the potential is a well
which contains two regions, an inner and an outer part. The inner part ex-
tends from the center of the well (r = 0) up to the absolute minimum. The
outer part includes the rest, namely the potential wall which smoothly grows

radially up to a certain constant value. Notice that the wall is inﬁnitely thick,
so no analogue of the tunnel eﬀect is possible here. These features of the po-
tential well reveal already that the pulse possesses two components. In fact,
we observe in Fig. 5 that the inner component of the pulse is bell-shaped,
while the outer component is an analogue of the exponential-decaying wings
of the probability density of a bound state penetrating a smooth potential
well. The potential well shrinks radially along the propagation distance and
the local maximum in the center decreases and eventually disappears at the
self-focusing distance. So, the inner component of the pulse tends to concen-
trate at the origin and eventually self-focuses.

We have estimated the region in which the inner part of the pulse is con-
centrated as follows. From the intensity proﬁle of the pulse, obtained from
numerical simulations, one can notice that it is well ﬁtted by the superpo-
sition of two Gaussian functions, as shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6. In
order to determine quantitatively where the inner and outer part join, we
have performed the following operation in our simulations:

u(ξ, r) is a pure Gaussian function. For the present case (c.f. upper panel of
Fig. 6) η has its absolute maximum in the region where the inner and outer
lower panel of Fig. 6). Thus, we determine the
part of the pulse join (c.f.
boundary position, rjoin, between the inner and outer part of the pulse by
the absolute maximum of η.

In Fig. 7 we show the comparison between rjoin from simulations (solid
line) and the position of the absolute minimum of the potential obtained
from the quantum well potential (dashed line c.f. Fig. 5) Note that at ξ = 0
no deformation is observed in the simulations since the initial pulse shape is
Gaussian. For ξ > 0 a deformation of the pulse appears at the origin (r = 0)
and moves quickly to r
0.65. Afterwards rjoin shrinks and disappears at
the self-focusing distance. This qualitative behavior is found for all the cases

considered in this paper. Thus, our theoretical model does not predict the
appearance of the deformation at the origin, but the position of the absolute
minimum of the potential well follows closely the behavior of rjoin over the
main part of the propagation distance.

From the radii shown in Fig.7 we can calculate the fraction of energy µ
stored in the inner component of the pulse, which is compared in Fig. 8 with
those from the numerical simulations. We observe that there is a energy ﬂow
from the inner part to the outer part when the pulse shrinks. Note that
the inner component of the pulse releases more energy in the second half
of its propagation towards the self-focusing distance, where the shrinkage of
rjoin is more pronounced. At the self-focusing distance most of the energy is
stored in the outer component of the pulse which stays with the pulse and
< 5) the present
does not diﬀract. We also note that for low powers (
model overestimates the release of energy towards the outer region, while for
> 5) it is underestimated. This diﬀerence is related to the
higher powers (
discrepancy found for the estimation of the self-focusing distance (see Fig.
2). We note, that the ansatz in earlier works (see for instance [9]) would
lead to a potential well too, however the wall of this potential well has a
ﬁnite thickness. Thus, in the previous ansatz the outer part of the pulse
diﬀracts out in contrast to the present model where the pulse is completely
self-trapped.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have revisited the problem of self-focusing of a laser pulse in
a gas Kerr medium modeled by the (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation. We have deﬁned a new trial solution taking into account that
during the self-focusing process the pulse splits in an inner and an outer
component. In the trial solution the outer component is taken into account
via a phase correction. We have used a quantum well analogy to explain
the dynamics of the laser pulse. According to this picture, the laser pulse is
represented by a bound state of a particle trapped in a quantum well. The
inner component of the laser pulse corresponds to that part of the bound state
where the energy of the system is larger than the bottom of the potential well.
The outer part is the analogue of the exponential-decaying wings of the bound
state penetrating a smooth potential wall. Here, the self-focusing process of
the laser pulse is associated to the shrinkage of the width of the quantum
well. Theory and simulations show that during the self-focusing process the
energy of the inner component ﬂows to the outer one which stays with the
pulse and does not diﬀract. Finally, only a fraction of the pulse energy

self-focuses. The present theory provides better agreement with results of
numerical simulations than most of the theories used in the last decades for
the self-focusing process of laser pulses. Comparison of the prediction of the
present theory with Marburger’s formula for the self-focusing distance shows
an agreement within an error of 20% over a broad range of input powers of
the pulse. Further comparisons with numerical simulations show that the
pulse length as well as the on-axis intensity are predicted correctly within a
20% error too. We may emphasize that the comparisons are performed for
collimated laser pulses, which is the worst case possible. Consideration of
an external focusing would give even lower errors. Finally, we note that the
present theory can be easily extended to consider losses and ionization of the
gas medium.

where A(ξ), a(ξ) and c(ξ) are assumed to be variational parameters, and κ
is an unknown constant. By doing variational approximation similar to that
one in section 2, but using the ansatz (45), one can show that in the critical
regime (P = Pcr)

κ = constant

a′′(0) = 0.

Thus, in principle we can neglect corrections on the diﬀraction term and keep
only the corrections in the nonlinear term in (45).

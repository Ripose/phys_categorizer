We consider pulse propagation in a linear anomalously dispersive medium where the group velocity
exceeds the speed of light in vacuum (c) or even becomes negative. A signal velocity is deﬁned
operationally based on the optical signal-to-noise ratio, and is computed for cases appropriate to
the recent experiment where such a negative group velocity was observed. It is found that quantum
ﬂuctuations limit the signal velocity to values less than c.

PACS: 03.65.Sq, 42.50.-p, 42.50.Lc

It is well known that the group velocity vg of a light
pulse can exceed c in an anomalously dispersive medium.
If there is no appreciable absorption or amplication, a
suﬃciently smooth initial pulse envelope E(t) becomes
simply eiφE(t − L/vg) after the propagation distance L,
where φ is a (real) phase. E(t − L/vg) in this case is
the analytic continuation of E(t − L/c) over the time
increment (1/c − 1/vg)L > 0 [1]. This analytic continua-
tion means that information is transferred at velocity c,
not vg, so that there is no violation of causality implied
by the superluminal group velocity. As discussed many
years ago by Sommerfeld and Brillouin [2], a group ve-
locity greater than c does not violate causality because it
is not the velocity of information transmission [3]. They
noted that the “frontal velocity,” the velocity at which
an inﬁnitely sharp step-function-like disturbance of the
light intensity propagates, can serve as a velocity of in-
formation transfer.

While a smoothly varying pulse is just an analytic con-
tinuation of the input pulse E(t − L/c), it is remarkable
nonetheless that a very small leading edge enables one to
predict the entire pulse. This small leading edge of the
pulse can in principle extend inﬁnitely far back in time.
These considerations are not immediately applicable
in the laboratory. There is ﬁrst of all the impossibility
in principle of realizing the inﬁnite bandwidth associated
with a step-function “front.” But more subtle questions
arise from the fact that a tiny leading edge of a smooth
pulse determines the entire pulse. For one thing, it is not
obvious how to deﬁne the “arrival time” of the signal [4].
In practice, one cannot extend the “arrival time” to any
time before the detection of the ﬁrst photon. Further-
more, if the tiniest leading edge of a smooth “superlumi-
nal” pulse determines the entire pulse, we must account
for the eﬀect that quantum ﬂuctuations at the leading

edge might have on the detection of the pulse [5], [6].

We suggest here an operational deﬁnition of the sig-
nal velocity and apply it to the recently observed super-
luminal propagation of a light pulse in a gain medium
[7]. This experiment showed not only that a superlu-
minal group velocity is possible without any signiﬁcant
pulse distortion, but also demonstrated that this can oc-
cur with no appreciable absorption or ampliﬁcation [8].
Previous considerations of quantum noise in this context
focused on the motion of the peak of a wave packet, and
on the observability of the superluminal velocity of the
peak at the one- or few-photon level [5], [6]. Here we
consider more generally the practical question of how a
signal should be deﬁned, and reach the conclusion that
quantum noise impedes the observation of the superlumi-
nal signal velocity, regardless of the intensity of the input
pulse.

The experimental situation of interest is illustrated
in Figure 1 [7]. A gas of atoms with a Λ-type tran-
sition scheme is optically pumped into state |1i. Two
cw Raman pump beams tuned oﬀ-resonance from the
|1i → |0i transition with a slight frequency oﬀset 2∆ν,
and a pulsed probe beam acting on the |0i → |2i tran-
sition, propagate collinearly through the cell. The com-
mon detuning ∆0 of the Raman and probe ﬁelds from
the excited state |0i is much larger than any of the Rabi
frequencies or decay rates involved, so that we can adia-
batically eliminate all oﬀ-diagonal density-matrix terms
involving state |0i. Then we obtain the following expres-
sion for the linear susceptibility as a function of the probe
detuning ν [7], [9]:

whose detailed form and numerical value are not required
for our present purposes. We note only that the disper-
sion relation (1) satisﬁes the Kramers-Kronig relations
and therefore that the pulse propagation described by it
is causal.

Consider now the detection of a signal corresponding
to a light pulse as indicated in Figure 1(a). We assign a
time window T centered about a pre-arranged time t0 at
the detector and monitor the photocurrent produced by
the detector. We assume there is a background level of
irradiation that causes a constant average photocurrent
i0 when no light pulse is received; there will be a nonvan-
ishing i0 whenever the medium exhibits gain. We assume
further that an increased photocurrent i1(t) is registered
when a light pulse is received, and assert that a signal has
been received when the integrated photocurrent
dti1(t)
rises above the background level by a certain prescribed
factor. The time at which this preset level of conﬁdence
is reached is then deﬁned to be the time of arrival of this
signal as recorded by an ideal detector.

The observable corresponding to this deﬁnition of the

arrival time is

t0−T /2

where ˆE(+)(L, t1) and ˆE(−)(L, t1) are respectively the
positive- and negative-frequency parts of the electric ﬁeld
operator at the exit point (z = L) of the medium and T /2
is half the time window assigned to the pulse, typically a
few times the pulse width. C is a constant to be speciﬁed
later. The expectation value h ˆS(L, t)i is proportional to
the number of photons that have arrived at the detector
at the time t. If h ˆS1(L, t)i and h ˆS0(L, t)i are respectively
the expectation values of ˆS(L, t) with and without an in-
put pulse, then the photocurrent diﬀerence for an ideal
detector is h ˆS1(L, t)i − h ˆS0(L, t)i. On the other hand,

2

the second-order variance of the integrated photon num-
ber, h∆2 ˆS(L, t)i, gives the noise power due to quantum
ﬂuctuations. Hence it is appropriate to deﬁne an optical
signal-to-noise ratio [10]

SN R(L, t) =

(h ˆS1(L, t)i − h ˆS0(L, t)i)2
h∆2 ˆS(L, t)i

.

(3)

As discussed above, we deﬁne the arrival time ts of a sig-
nal as the time at which SN R(L, t) reaches a prescribed
threshold level.

The positive-frequency part of the electric ﬁeld opera-

tor can be written as

ˆE(+)(z, t) = e−iωo(t−z/c)

dkK(ω)ˆa(ω)e−iω(t−z/vg ) ,

∞

(4)

where ωo is the central frequency of the pulse, K(ω) ∝
ω1/2, and [ˆa(ω), ˆa†(ω′)] = δ(ω − ω′). Eq. (4) assumes
plane-wave propagation in the z direction and that the
group-velocity approximation is valid. K(ω) may for our
purposes be taken to be constant since the frequency
range of the two gain lines are far smaller than the central
frequency ωo. It is then convenient to deﬁne the constant
C in Eq. (2) to be 1/(2π|K(ωo)|2).

In the experiment of interest the anomalously disper-
sive medium is a phase-insensitive linear ampliﬁer for
which [11]

ˆaout(ω) = g(ω)ˆain(ω) +

|g(ω)|2 − 1ˆb†

in(ω) ,

(5)

p
where ˆain and ˆaout refer respectively to the input (z = 0)
and output (z = L) ports of the ampliﬁer and the opera-
tor ˆb(ω) is a bosonic operator ([ˆb(ω), ˆb†(ω′)] = δ(ω − ω′))
that commutes with all operators ˆain(ω) and ˆa†
in(ω) and
whose appearance in Eq.
(5) is required among other
things to preserve the commutation relations for the ﬁeld
operators ˆaout and ˆa†
out. |g(ω)|2 is the power gain factor
characterizing the ampliﬁer.

Now we derive a rather general expression for the
optical signal-to-noise ratio. Consider ﬁrst the case of
propagation over the distance L in a vacuum (g(ω) =
1). We assume that the initial state |ψi of the ﬁeld
is a coherent state such that ˆa(ω)|ψi = α(ω)|ψi for
all ω, where α(ω) is a c-number. For such a state
we may write ˆE(+)(0, t)|ψi = α(t)|ψi, where α(t) ≡
π−1/4(Np/τp)1/2 exp(−(t − Tc)2/2τ 2
p ), Np is the average
number of photons in the initial pulse of duration τp,
and Tc is the time corresponding to the pulse peak. We
obtain after a straightforward calculation the result

SN R(L, t) = h ˆS1(0, t − L/c)ivac = SN R(0, t − L/c) .

(6)

This expresses the expected result that the pulse propa-
gates at the velocity c with no excess noise arising from
propagation.

D
Next we treat the case of pulse propagation over the
distance L in the anomalously dispersive medium, using
Eq. (5) with g(ω) 6= 1 and assuming again an initially
coherent ﬁeld. We obtain in this case

h ˆS1(L, t)i − h ˆS0(L, t)i = |g(0)|2h ˆS1(0, t − L/vg)ivac (7)

where h ˆS0(L, t)i = (1/2π)

is the photon number in the absence of any pulse in-
put to the medium and Tc = t0 − L/vg. The fact that
h ˆS0(L, t)i > 0 is due to ampliﬁed spontaneous emission
(ASE) [10]; in the experiment of interest the ASE is a
spontaneous Raman process.

Before proceeding further with the calculation of the
optical signal-to-noise ratio, we note here that the gain
factor

|g(0)|2 = e4πMγ/(∆ν

(8)

and that the eﬀective signal h ˆS1(L, t)i − h ˆS0(L, t)i is pro-
portional to the input signal h ˆS1(0, t − L/vg)ivac with
time delay L/vg determined by the group velocity vg. In
the anomalously dispersive medium vg = c/(n + νdn/dν)
and can be > c or even negative, resulting in a time delay

which is shorter than the time delay the pulse would ex-
perience upon propagation through the same length in
vacuum, or can become negative.
In other words, the
eﬀective signal intensity can be reached sooner than in
the case of propagation in vacuum.

In order to determine with conﬁdence when a signal
is received, however, one must evaluate the SNR. Again
using the commutation relations for the ﬁeld operators,
we obtain for the ﬂuctuating noise background

h∆2 ˆS(L, t)i ≡ h ˆS2(L, t)i − h ˆS(L, t)i2

is a two-time correlation function for the ampliﬁed spon-
(10)
taneous emission noise. The three terms in Eq.
can be attributed to ampliﬁed shot noise, beat noise,
and ASE self-beat noise, respectively [12]. The ﬁrst two
terms dominate in the presence of a strong input signal

pulse, while the last term dominates if the input signal is
small and the gain is large. In the case of a strong input
signal and large gain, the second term gives the largest
contribution to the noise and scales almost linearly with
the signal strength h ˆSi, the signal gain |g(0)|2, and the
peak gain |g(∆ν)|2 = exp(4πM L/γλ). This large noise
term eﬀectively reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of the
advanced light pulse, causing the eﬀective signal arrival
time to be retarded by a time delay that is far larger than
the pulse advancement.
Finally, using Eqs.

(7) and (10), we compute
SN R(out)(L, t) for the propagation through the anoma-
lously dispersive medium. In Figure 2 we plot the results
of such computations for SN R(out)(L, t) as a function of
time on the output signal. For reference we also show
SN R for the identical pulse propagating over the same
length in vacuum. It is evident from the results shown
that the pulse propagating in vacuum maintains a higher
SNR. In other words, for the experiments of interest here
[7], [9], the actual arrival time of the signal is delayed,
even though the pulse itself is advanced compared with
propagation over the same distance in vacuum.

By requiring that at some time t′ the SNR of the out-
put pulse be equal to that of the input pulse [Eq. (6)] at
a time t, i.e.,

SN R(out)(L, t′) = SN R(in)(0, t) ,

(12)

we obtain a time diﬀerence δt = t′ − t that marks the
propagation time of the light signal, and L/δt gives the
signal velocity. In Figure 3 we plot δt as a function of
gain for (t − Tc)/τp = −1, −2, and −3. This corresponds
to cases where the signal point is set at 1,2, and 3 times
the pulse width on the leading edge of the pulse. We also
plot for reference the pulse advance L/vg. It is evident
that the retardation in the SNR far exceeds the pulse
advancement. In other words, the quantum noise added

In this letter we have presented what in our opinion is
a realistic deﬁnition, based on photodetections, of the ve-
locity of the signal carried by a light pulse. We analyzed
this signal velocity for the recently demonstrated super-
luminal light pulse propagation, and found that while the
pulse and the eﬀective signal are both advanced via prop-
agation at a group velocity higher than c, or even nega-
tive, the signal velocity deﬁned here is still bounded by c.
The physical mechanism that limits the signal velocity is
quantum ﬂuctuation. Namely, because the transparent,
anomalously dispersive medium is realized using closely-
placed gain lines, the various ampliﬁed quantum ﬂuctu-
ations introduce additional noise that eﬀectively reduces
the SNR in the detection of the signals carried by the
light pulse. This is related to the “no cloning” theorem
[13], [14], which was attributed to the quantum ﬂuctua-
tions in an ampliﬁer, and which is a direct consequence
of the superposition principle in quantum theory.

Finally we note that it is perhaps possible to ﬁnd other
deﬁnitions of a “signal” velocity for a light pulse, diﬀer-
ent from that we presented here. But such a deﬁnition
should in our opinion satisfy two basic criteria. First, it
must be directly related to a known and practical way of
detecting a signal. Second, it should refer to the fastest
practical way of communicating information. While it
may be hard to prove that any deﬁnition meets the sec-
ond criterion, it can be hoped that the recent interest

We have remeasured the absolute 1S-2S transition frequency νH in atomic hydrogen. A compar-
ison with the result of the previous measurement performed in 1999 sets a limit of (−29 ± 57) Hz
for the drift of νH with respect to the ground state hyperﬁne splitting νCs in 133Cs. Combining this
result with the recently published drift of an optical transition frequency in 199Hg+ against νCs, we
˙α/α = (−0.9 ± 4.2) × 10−15 yr−1 without assumptions of possible correlations
deduce a limit of
between drifts of α and µCs/µB . Besides, we derive that the fractional time variation of µRb/µCs is
smaller than (0.5 ± 2.1) × 10−15 yr−1.

In the era of a rapid development of precision experi-
mental methods, the stability of fundamental constants
becomes a question of basic interest. Any drift of non-
gravitational constants is forbidden in all metric theo-
ries of gravity including general relativity. The basis of
these theories is Einstein’s Equivalence Principle (EEP)
which states that weight is proportional to mass, and
that in any local freely falling reference frame, the result
of any non-gravitational experiment must be independent
of time and space. This hypothesis can be proven only
experimentally as no theory predicting the values of fun-
damental constants exists. In contrast to metric theories,
string theory models aiming to unify quantum mechanics
and gravitation allow for, or even predict, violations of
EEP. Limits on the variation of fundamental constants
might therefore provide important constraints on these
new theoretical models.

A recent analysis of quasar absorption spectra with
redshifted UV transition lines indicates for a variation of
α on a level of ∆α/α = (−0.54 ± 0.12) × 10−5 for a red-
shift range (0.2 < z < 3.7) [1]. On geological timescales,
a limit for the drift of α has been deduced from isotope
ratios in the natural ﬁssion reactor of Oklo, Gabon, which
operated about 2 Gyr ago. Modelling the processes which
have changed the isotope ratios of heavy elements gives
a limit of ∆α/α = (−0.36 ± 1.44) × 10−8 [2]. As pointed
out in [3], systematics in non-laboratory measurements
are generally diﬃcult to control.

Laboratory experiments test variations of fundamen-
tal constants during last few years. This type of exper-
iment is typically based on repeated absolute frequency
measurements, i.e. comparison of a transition frequency
with the reference frequency of a 133Cs atomic clock. Any

measurement of the drift of an absolute frequency in-
evitably involves the product of µCs/µB and some power
of α, where µCs is the magnetic moment of the Cs nu-
cleus and µB is the Bohr magneton [4]. It is not possible
to distinguish between their contributions to the drift by
measuring the frequency of one transition in one atomic
system without imposing some restrictions (e.g. postu-
lating that one of them is not changing) or assuming
correlations (e.g. [5]).

Nevertheless, a separate evaluation can been done ei-
ther by a direct comparison of two frequencies without
involving the primary frequency standard, or from a com-
bination of two absolute frequency measurements. In this
Letter, we deduce separate stringent limits for the rela-
tive drifts of the ﬁne structure constant α and of µCs/µB
from combining the drifts of two optical frequencies in
the hydrogen atom and in the mercury ion with respect
to the ground state hyperﬁne splitting in 133Cs. Compar-
ing two measurements performed at diﬀerent places and
at diﬀerent times we have to use the Lorentz invariance
and we have to assume that the constants change linearly
and do not oscillate on a year scale. With exception of
this, our results are free from any model assumptions of
constants behavior and possible correlations.

F = ±1) two-photon transition in atomic

hydrogen to the frequency of the ground state hyperﬁne
splitting of 133Cs using a frequency comb technique [8].
The 1999 setup of the hydrogen spectrometer has been
described previously in [9], so we present only a brief de-
scription with emphasis on the improvements since 1999.
A sketch of the actual setup is shown in Fig.1.

A cw dye laser emitting near 486 nm is locked to an
external reference cavity. The new cavity for the 2003
measurement is more stable and drifts less than 0.5 Hz/s
at 486 nm. The linewidth of the dye laser stabilized on
the new cavity has been characterized as 60 Hz for an
averaging time of 1 s. A small part of the laser light is
transferred to a neighboring lab where its absolute fre-
quency is measured. The main part is frequency doubled,
and the resulting radiation near 243 nm (corresponding
to half of the 1S-2S transition frequency) is coupled into
a linear enhancement cavity inside the vacuum chamber
of the hydrogen spectrometer.

Hydrogen atoms from a radio-frequency (rf) gas dis-
charge are cooled by collisions with the walls of a copper
nozzle to 5-6 K. The nozzle forms a beam of cold atomic
hydrogen which leaves the nozzle collinearly with the cav-
ity axis and enters the interaction region between the

2

nozzle and the detector shielded from stray electric ﬁelds
by a Faraday cage. Some of the atoms are excited from
the ground state to the metastable 2S state by Doppler-
free absorption of two counter propagating photons from
the laser ﬁeld in the enhancement cavity. After the 1999
measurement performed at a background gas pressure of
around 10−6 mbar in the interaction region, we upgraded
the vacuum system to a diﬀerential pumping conﬁgura-
tion. This allowed us to vary the background gas pres-
sure in a range of 10−8–10−7 mbar in 2003 and to reduce
the background gas pressure shift and the corresponding
uncertainty to 2 Hz.

Due to small apertures, only atoms ﬂying close to the
cavity axis can enter the detection region where the 2S
atoms are quenched in a small electric ﬁeld and emit Lα-
photons. The excitation light and the hydrogen beam
are periodically blocked by two mutually phase locked
choppers, and the Lα-photons are counted time-resolved
only in the dark part of a cycle. The delay τ between
blocking the 243 nm radiation and the start of photon
counting sets the upper limit for the velocity of the 2S
atoms contributing to the signal. For some deﬁnite τ
only atoms with velocities v < l/τ are selected, where l is
the distance between nozzle and detector. Therefore, ve-
locity dependent systematic eﬀects such as second-order
Doppler shift and time-of-ﬂight broadening are smaller
for spectra recorded at higher τ . With the help of a
multi-channel scaler, we count all photons and sort them
into 12 adjacent time bins. From each scan of the laser
frequency over the hydrogen 1S-2S resonance we there-
fore get up to 12 spectra at diﬀerent delays. To correct
for the second order Doppler shift, we use an elaborate
theoretical model to ﬁt all the delayed spectra of one
scan simultaneously with a set of 7 ﬁt parameters [9].
The result of the ﬁtting procedure is the 1S-2S transi-
tion frequency for a hydrogen atom at rest.

The transition frequency depends linearly on the exci-
tation light intensity due to the dynamic AC-Stark shift.
We vary the intensity and extrapolate the transition fre-
quency to zero intensity to correct for this eﬀect [7].

For an absolute measurement of the 1S-2S transition
frequency, the dye laser frequency near 616.5 THz is
phase coherently compared with an atomic cesium foun-
tain clock. We take advantage of the frequency comb
technique recently developed in Garching and Boulder
[8] to bridge the large gap between the optical and ra-
dio frequency domains. A mode locked femtosecond (fs)
laser emits a pulse train which equals a comb of laser
modes in the frequency domain. The mode spacing cor-
responds to the repetition rate frequency frep of the fs
laser, and the frequency of each mode can be written as
fn = nfrep + f0, where n is a large integer number and
f0 < frep is the comb oﬀset frequency. The repetition
rate frep can easily be detected with a photodiode. For
combs spanning more than one octave, f0 can be deter-
mined by frequency doubling an infrared comb mode fn

in a nonlinear crystal to 2 × fn and measuring the beat
note with the appropriate mode f2n of the blue part of
the comb, yielding f0 = 2fn − f2n.

In our experiment, the frequency comb from a mode-
locked fs Ti:Sapphire laser with a repetition rate frep of
800 MHz is broadened in a photonic crystal ﬁber to cover
more than an optical octave. The rate frep is controlled
by adjusting the cavity length of the fs laser, and f0 is
controlled by changing the pump power. We phase lock
both degrees of freedom of the comb (frep, f0) to the
radio frequency output of the Cs fountain clock to get a
frequency comb with modes whose frequencies are known
with the accuracy of the primary frequency standard.

For both the 1999 and 2003 measurements, the trans-
portable Cs fountain clock FOM has been installed in
MPQ. Its stability is 1.8 × 10−13τ −1/2 and its accuracy
has been evaluated to 8 × 10−16 [10] at BNM-SYRTE.
During the experiments in Garching, only a veriﬁcation
at the level of 10−15 has been performed. Consequently
we attribute a conservative FOM accuracy of 2 × 10−15
for these measurements.

We have measured the 1S-2S-transition in atomic hy-
drogen during 10 days in 1999 and during 12 days in
2003. For comparability, both data sets have been an-
alyzed using the same theoretical line-shape model [9].
In Fig.2, the results of the extrapolation to zero exci-
tation light intensity and the respective error bars for
each day are represented. The scatter between the day
data is larger than the error bars of the separate days
for both measurements. Possible tiny asymmetries of
the hydrogen beam and of the cavity mode arise from
misalignment of the enhancement cavity axis and intra-
cavity diaphragms might lead to a small uncompensated
ﬁrst-order Doppler shift; this eﬀect should average after
several days of measurement and multiple changes in the
spectrometer adjustment. We have experimentally esti-
mated the magnitude of other possible candidates for the
data scatter: an intra-beam pressure shift, a background

duced by the rf gas discharge, stray electric ﬁelds and can
exclude all of them on the level of the observed scatter.
The averaging of the the 1999 and 2003 day data was
performed without weighting them for the day errors (the
result presented in [7] was inadvertently described as ”the
weighted mean value” but was calculated without consid-
eration of the day errors). All known systematic eﬀects
are taken into account in the mutually equivalent eval-
uation process of the 1999 as well as the 2003 measure-
ments. Due to the larger background gas pressure, the
1999 result must be corrected by +10 Hz [7]. Compar-
ing both measurements we deduce a diﬀerence equal to
(−29 ± 57) Hz over a time interval of 44 months. This
is equivalent to a fractional time variation of the ratio
νCs/νH equal to (3.2 ± 6.4) × 10−15 yr−1.

The frequency of any optical transition can be written

as [4, 11]

ν = A · Ry · Frel(α),

(1)

where Ry is the Rydberg energy and the relativistic cor-
rection Frel(α) takes into account relativistic and many-
body eﬀects. Frel depends on the transition in the sys-
tem considered and embodies the dependency on α (the
α dependency of Ry cancels in absolute frequency mea-
surements), while the parameter A is independent of any
fundamental constants.

In conclusion, we have determined limits for the drift
of α, µCs/µB and µRb/µCs from laboratory experiments
without assumptions of their conceivable correlations.
All these limits are consistent with zero drift. Quasar
absorption spectra measured with the Keck/HIRES spec-
trograph show a signiﬁcant deviation between the values
of α today and 10 Gyrs ago [1]. A corresponding linear
drift of α would be smaller than the uncertainty of our
result, therefore it cannot be excluded. Future labora-
tory and astrophysical measurements with higher accu-
racy will continue to address the question whether α has
drifted and continues to drift, or whether it has reached
an asymptotic value or the extremum of an oscillation.

enced even if some correlation between the fundamental

Both limits (9) and (10) are consistent with zero. Com-
bining the result of our measurement with the results
from [6] we have obtained a model-independent precise
restriction for a contemporary drift of α.

These results allow us to deduce a restriction for the
relative drift of the nuclear magnetic moments in 87Rb

The realizable refractive indices of passive and active media are considered. For passive media,
bounds for the refractive index variation in a ﬁnite bandwidth are given. Special attention is
given to the loss and index variation in the case of left-handed materials. For active media, any
bounded function in a limited bandwidth can be approximated by the refractive index. However,
we argue that there also exist active media for which the refractive index cannot be deﬁned as an
analytic function in the upper half-plane of complex frequency. We analyze the electromagnetic
wave propagation in certain active media, and demonstrate the presence of a “backward” wave for
which both phase velocity and Poynting’s vector point towards the excitation source.

INTRODUCTION

During recent years several new types of artiﬁcial ma-
terials or metamaterials with sophisticated electromag-
netic properties have been designed. The fabrication of
custom structures with dimensions much smaller than
the relevant wavelength has made it possible to tailor the
eﬀective electric permittivity ǫ and the magnetic perme-
ability µ. For example, materials with thin metal wires
simulate the response of a low-density plasma so that
Re ǫ may become negative in the microwave range [1].
Similarly, with the help of a split-ring structure, a strong
magnetic resonance is achieved so that Re µ may be nega-
tive [2]. Passive media with Re ǫ and Re µ simultaneously
negative, ﬁrst realized by Smith et al.
[3], are particu-
larly interesting. Such materials are often referred to
as left-handed, since, for negative ǫ and µ, the electric
ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld, and the wave vector form a left-
handed set of vectors. As the Poynting vector and the
wave vector point in opposite directions, the refraction
at the boundary to a regular medium is negative. The
concept of negative refraction, introduced by Veselago
already in 1968 [4], has opened a new horizon of appli-
cations in electromagnetics and optics. In particular the
possibility of manipulating the near-ﬁeld may have con-
siderable potential, enabling imaging with no limit on the
resolution [5].

Materials with negative ǫ and µ are necessarily dis-
persive [4, 6], and loss is unavoidable. Loss has serious
consequences for the performance of certain components;
for example, it has been shown that the resolution associ-
ated with the Veselago–Pendry lens is strongly dependent
on the loss of the material [7, 8]. Therefore, it is im-
portant to look for metamaterial designs with negative
real part of the refractive index while the loss is low. In
this paper, instead of performing a search in an inﬁnite,
complex design space, we will ﬁnd ultimate, theoretical

bounds based on causality (Section I). We will also ﬁnd
optimal ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) functions. For example, suppose
our goal is refractive index close to –1 while loss is negli-
[ω1, ω2]. What is then
gible in a limited bandwidth Ω
the minimal variation of the refractive index in Ω, given
that the medium is passive? If we force the real part of
the refractive index to be exactly –1 in Ω, what will then
be the minimal loss there?

≡

Active metamaterials have so far received limited at-
tention.
In Section II, we will demonstrate that any
bounded function of frequency can be approximated by
the refractive index of a certain class of active media.
Moreover, we point out that there exist active media for
which the refractive index cannot be deﬁned as an an-
alytic function in the upper half-plane of complex fre-
quency. In other words, for these media, it is impossi-
ble to excite the “forward”-propagating mode separately;
both solutions to Maxwell’s equations, corresponding to
the two choices of sign of the refractive index, are nec-
essarily excited. Furthermore, active media exist where
only the “backward” wave is excited so that both phase
velocity and Poynting’s vector point towards the excita-
tion source.

II. PASSIVE MEDIA

Any electromagnetic medium must be causal in the mi-
croscopic sense; the polarization and magnetization can-
not precede the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively.
This means that ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) obey the Kramers–Kronig
relations. In terms of the susceptibilities χ = ǫ
1 or
1, these relation can be written
χ = µ

ditions are equivalent to the fact that χ is analytic in
the upper half-plane (Im ω > 0), and uniformly square
integrable in the closed upper half-plane [17]. The sus-
ceptibilities are deﬁned for negative frequencies by the
symmetry relation

so that their inverse Fourier transforms are real. For
passive media, in addition to (1) and (2) we have:

Im χ(ω) > 0 for ω > 0.

The losses, as given by the imaginary parts of the sus-
ceptibilities, can be vanishingly small; however they are
always present unless we are considering vacuum [6].

Eqs. (1)-(3) imply that 1 + χ is zero-free in the upper
half-plane [6]. Thus the refractive index n = √ǫ√µ can
always be chosen as an analytic function in the upper
+1 as
half-plane. With the additional choice that n

, n is determined uniquely, and it is easy to see
that (1)-(3) hold for the substitution χ

While any refractive index with positive imaginary
part can be realized at a single frequency, the conditions
(1)-(3) put serious limitations on what is possible to re-
alize in a ﬁnite bandwidth. First we will investigate the
possibility of designing materials with the real part of
the refractive index less than unity. In particular we will
analyze to what extent it is possible in a limited band-
width to have a constant index below unity (or even be-
low zero) while the loss is small. We set n
1 = u + iv
(or χ = u + iv), where u and v are the real and imaginary
1 (or χ), respectively. To begin with, we set
parts of n
v(ω) = 0 in the interval Ω = [ω1, ω2]. (The case with a
small imaginary part will be treated later.) By writing
out the Hilbert transform and using (2), we ﬁnd

As an example, consider the case where the goal is re-
fractive index close to –1 in an interval Ω with ∆
1. In
the limit of zero imaginary index, (6) gives that the vari-
ation of the real index in the interval is larger than 4∆.
It is interesting that the minimal variation is obtained
approximately if the medium has sharp Lorentzian res-
onances for a low frequency. For example, let ǫ(ω) =
µ(ω) = 1 + f (ω), where

more, it is worth noting that if we want the real index
variation to be zero in Ω, the maximum imaginary part of
the refractive index in Ω must be larger than 2∆. The re-
quired imaginary part in Ω can roughly be approximated
by weak resonances at (ω1 + ω2)/2, see Fig. 1.

So far we have considered the case where the goal is a
constant u(ω) < 0 in Ω. If the goal is u(ω) > 0 in Ω, it
is the last term in (4) that comes to rescue. Inspired by
the result (5), we may let u(ω) approach a delta function
at a frequency much larger than ω. Indeed, in the limit
where this resonance frequency approaches inﬁnity, the
function u(ω) is constant and positive in Ω while v(ω)
is zero. Of course this limit is not realistic; in practice
the resonance frequency is limited to, say ωmax, where
ωmax > ω2. The associated bounds are easily deduced
along the same lines as above. For example, (6) becomes

refractive index associated with a Lorentzian resonance at
ω = ω0. The two ﬁgures represent the same functions but
the scale is diﬀerent. Also shown are the real part and
imaginary part for the case where the real part is –1 in Ω.
In general this refractive index function can be found us-
ing the approach in [10]; however, when ω1 is much larger
than the resonance frequency and bandwidth, the required v

Similarly, there may be a lower bound ωmin, where 0 <
ωmin < ω1, on the resonance frequency. The stricter
inequalities in this case, corresponding to (5)-(8), can be
found in a similar fashion.

Eq.

(4) has another interesting consequence.
If the

III. ACTIVE MEDIA

On the basis of causality, it is clear that the suscepti-
bilities of active media also satisfy (1) and (2). However,
(3) is certainly not valid. Kre˘ın and Nudel’man have
shown how to approximate a square integrable function
in a ﬁnite bandwidth by a function satisfying (1) and (2)
[12, 13]. The approximation can be done with arbitrary
precision; however, there is generally a trade-oﬀ between
precision and the energy of χ outside the interval. Ex-
amples of such approximation are given in [14]. Once a
valid susceptibility has been found, a possible refractive
index can e.g. be found by setting n = ǫ = µ = 1 + χ.
Hence, in principle, n can approximate any square inte-
grable function in a limited bandwidth.

Since (3) does not hold for active media,

it is no
longer true that ǫ and µ are zero-free in the upper half-
Indeed, the permittivity associated with an in-
plane.
verted Lorentz model is ǫ = 1
f , where f is given by
(9). If F > 1, ǫ has a simple zero in the upper half-plane.
Thus, assuming µ = 1, the refractive index n = √ǫ can-
not be deﬁned as an analytic function in the upper half-
plane. This shows that not every causal, active medium
has a well-deﬁned refractive index.

−

It is interesting to investigate the physical implications
of this fact. Considering wave propagation in the z di-
rection, the general solution to Maxwell’s equations in
homogenous media is a superposition of the propagation
inωz/c). The refractive
factors exp(inωz/c) and exp(
index is useful mainly when only one of these terms is
excited. Writing this term exp(inωz/c), one can argue
that relativistic causality forces n(ω) to be analytic in
the upper half-plane [9, 15]. For the active media where
n(ω) contains branch points in the upper half-plane, we
must conclude that it is impossible to excite one of the
waves exp(inωz/c) and exp(
inωz/c) separately. The
superposition of “forward” and “backward” propagating
waves is necessary to ensure relativistic causality.

−

−

To verify that microscopic causality implies relativis-
tic causality also for active media, we solve Maxwell’s
equations for a plane wave in vacuum, normally incident
to a slab with parameters ǫ and µ. Assuming the slab
thickness d, we ﬁnd the total reﬂection coeﬃcient R and
transmission coeﬃcient T :

Note that the choice of the sign of n does not matter
since only even powers of n are present in R and T . For
the same reason R and T contain no branch points in
the upper half-plane. The reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients (14) were derived under the assumption that
γ, for a suﬃciently large, real constant γ. For
Im ω
active media, γ > 0 in general, i.e., R and T may contain
poles in the upper half-plane, leading to instability. Nev-
ertheless, the reﬂection and transmission responses and
the ﬁeld in the slab are relativistically causal. This fact
can established using the analyticity of the respective
functions in the half-plane Im ω > γ and their asymp-
totic behavior in that region. For example, T tends to
exp(iωd/c) as Im ω
, which means that the signal-
front delay through the slab is d/c.
It is tempting to take the limit d

to obtain the
usual Fresnel equations and the propagation character-
istics when the active medium ﬁlls the entire half-plane
z > 0. However, this limit may in some cases be mis-
leading, as demonstrated by the following simple exam-
ple. Consider a slab of an inverted Lorentzian medium
ǫ = 1
f and µ = 1, where f is given by (9). If d is
ﬁxed and F is small (corresponding to low gain), then
R and T contain no poles. The transmission coeﬃcient
exp(iωnd/c) and
and the ﬁeld in the slab becomes T
≈
exp(iωnz/c), respectively, where n = 1
f /2. For ﬁxed
F and suﬃciently large d there will be poles in the up-
per half-plane; in other words the active system will be
unstable. The associated time-domain responses of the
system are determined by R and T for Im ω > γ, where γ
is chosen suﬃciently large so that the half-plane Im ω > γ
such a half-plane
contains no poles. In the limit d
no longer exists; the ﬁeld in the slab diverges as ω
,

leading to unphysical results.

−

−

−

As a ﬁnal, nontrivial example, consider the medium
ǫ = (1 + f )2 and µ = 1, where f is still given by (9).
Note that the associated susceptibilities satisﬁes (1) and
(2), so at least in principle, this medium is realizable. If
we choose the refractive index such that it is analytic in
the upper half-plane, we ﬁnd n = 1+f and η = 1/(1+f ).
When F is suﬃciently large, there exists a frequency ω1
with Re n =
1 while Im n is small. This seems to be a
potential route to negative refractive index at optical fre-
quencies [16]. Since Im ǫ is negative at ω1, this medium
is active. Note that for moderate thickness d, R and
T may have poles in the upper half-plane, so the ﬁelds
as given by (14) and (15) do not necessarily have any
physical signiﬁcance for real ω. However, when d is suﬃ-
ciently large, there are no poles in the upper half-plane.
The ﬁeld in the slab is then proportional to exp(inωz/c)
for small z and exp(
inωz/c) for z close to d. In other
words, at ω = ω1 the phase velocity and the Poynting
vector point in the negative (positive) z-direction near

the left-hand (right-hand) end. Since Im n(ω1) > 0 and
Im ǫ(ω1) < 0, the ﬁeld near the left-hand end of the
slab can be interpreted as a growing wave propagating
in negative z-direction. Nevertheless, the excitation of
this “backward” wave does not rely on the presence of

ﬁelds at the right-hand boundary of the slab.
z)/c
the time-domain ﬁeld in the slab for time t < (2d
is determined by the term 2η exp(iωnz/c)/(η + 1). By
letting d be suﬃciently large and choosing an appropri-
ate excitation pulse, we may come arbitrarily close to
the monochromatic “backward” wave at the frequency
ω1 [19].

−

Although the medium in this example is right-handed
(the phase velocity and Poynting vector point in the
same direction), at the frequency ω1 it is conveniently
described by a negative refractive index. In particular, at
oblique incidence the “backward” wave is refracted nega-
tively. This is a result of the phase match condition at the
boundary; the wavefronts on each side, projected on the
boundary, must propagate in the same direction. Never-
theless, the medium has rather diﬀerent properties from
the left-handed negative-index medium considered by
Veselago and Pendry. For example, when d is suﬃciently
small, there are no poles, and T
exp(+iω1d/c) at the
frequency ω1. Also, evanescent-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, as in
the Veselago–Pendry lens, will not arise in this medium.
This is seen by noting that when the incident wave vec-
tor is k = (0, ky, kz), the TE reﬂection and transmission

coeﬃcients are given by the substitutions η

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered the set of realizable permittivities,
permeabilities and refractive indices of passive and ac-
tive media. In the case of passive media we have proved
ultimate bounds for the loss and variation of the real
part of the permittivity, permeability, and refractive in-
dex. For active media, we have found that in princi-
ple, any permittivity, permeability, or refractive index as
a function of frequency can be realized approximately.
Furthermore, we have argued that active media exist
for which the refractive index is not always well-deﬁned.
For these media a “forward” or “backward” propagat-
ing wave cannot be excited separately; both waves must
necessarily coexist. Finally, we have seen that in certain
active media, only the “backward” propagating wave is
excited. For this wave both phase velocity and Poynt-
ing’s vector point towards the excitation source. These
media are conveniently described using a negative refrac-
tive index. Nevertheless, the medium is right-handed,
and evanescent-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, similar to that in the
Veselago–Pendry lens, do not exist. Note that any causal

excitation involves an inﬁnite band of frequencies, and
outside the limited negative-index band, the Poynting
vector points in the forward direction.

We emphasize that the refractive index should be used
with care for active media; although it sometimes can be
deﬁned as an analytic function in the upper half-plane,
the transfer function of the active system may have poles
in the upper half-plane, leading to instability.
In such
cases the solution to Maxwell’s equations is determined
by the ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) functions for suﬃciently large Im ω,
or by their time-domain counterparts.

While the notation has indicated an isotropic medium,
the bounds in this paper are valid for the eﬀective index
In
of the normal modes of anisotropic media as well.
this case the identiﬁcation of possible, associated ǫ and
µ tensors from the eﬀective index is more complicated,
but nevertheless feasible. More generally, the bounds are
valid for the eﬀective index of any electromagnetic mode
that can be excited separately and causally, provided the
eﬀective index is independent of the longitudinal coordi-
nate.

[17] If the medium is conducting at zero frequency, the electric
χ is singular at ω = 0. Although χ is not square integrable
in this case, similar relations as (1) can be derived [6].

[18] A similar bound can be derived when v(ω) varies slowly
in Ω; for example, if v(ω) is the imaginary part of a
Lorentzian with Γ = ω2 − ω1, the inequality holds with
the replacement 4/π → 2. Note that without an assump-
tion on the variation of v(ω), du/dω can take any value.
[19] For ω = ω1, the electromagnetic parameters ǫ and µ are
similar to those of the weak gain medium in the previous
paragraph. At ﬁrst sight, it is therefore surprising that
the solutions for narrow-banded excitation are so diﬀer-
ent. This dilemma is resolved by noting that for large d
there are poles in the upper half-plane for the medium
in the previous paragraph. Thus the solutions cannot be
compared directly for real ω.

Abstract

Numerical calculations are employed to study the modulation of light by

surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in photonic band gap (PBG) structures. The

on/oﬀ contrast ratio in a PBG switch based on an optical cavity is determined

as a function of the SAW-induced dielectric modulation. We show that these

structures exhibit high contrast ratios even for moderate acousto-optic cou-

pling.

The interaction of light with acoustic waves in materials is of both fundamental and

technological interest. When the acoustic wave propagates in the medium, it generates a

strain ﬁeld. Under appropriate conditions, the associated periodic change in the refractive

index causes the light to undergo Bragg reﬂection. Acoustic waves thus oﬀer a convenient

way to dynamically modulate light propagation. This eﬀect has been used in a number of

applications including modulators, signal processors, tunable ﬁlters, and beam deﬂectors.1

Due to the weakness of the acousto-optic (AO) interaction, however, many periods of the

acoustic modulation are normally required to increase the contrast between the transmitting

and reﬂecting states. The use of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in the place of bulk waves

has additional advantages.2,3 High-frequency SAWs with large acoustic power densities can

be easily generated by inter-digital transducers (IDT) on piezoelectric materials such as

GaAs. Since the fabrication of the IDTs employs conventional semiconductor technologies,

on-chip integration to active devices becomes possible.

In this letter, we propose a design that combines SAWs with an optical cavity inserted

in an asymmetric Bragg mirror to modulate an incident light beam through the AO eﬀect.

When Bragg mirrors with high-contrast dielectric materials are used, the band gap in the

light energy dispersion is large, while the ’defect’ states introduced in the gap by the cavity

have a narrow energy distribution. Because of the strong localization of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld, the AO interaction becomes signiﬁcantly enhanced in the cavity region, thus resulting

in high dielectric modulation. Recently, an optical modulator based on the optical Stark

eﬀect in a GaAs cavity has been demonstrated4 to yield a ratio of transmitted intensity in

the ’on’ state to that in the ’oﬀ’ state, known as the contrast ratio (CR), of 5. We show

that higher CRs can also be achieved with modest acoustic power in a SAW-based optical

modulator.

In photonic band gap (PBG) crystals, such as Bragg mirrors, a structural modulation

is used to create a periodic change in the refractive index (and, consequently, in the di-

electric function).5 This periodicity is comparable to the light wavelength. When a SAW

with a wavelength λs much longer than the periodicity of the underlying PBG structure

2

propagates across the structure, an additional time-dependent periodicity is superimposed

on its dielectric function, as shown in Fig. 1. The solution to Maxwell’s equations has to

include the eﬀects of both the short- and the long-range periodicities. We have extended the

mathematically rigorous transfer matrix (TM) method6−8 to the case where the unit cell in

the direction of light propagation is a multiple of λs and the dielectric function varies with

the SAW frequency ωs. When light of frequency ω0>>ωs

impinges on the PBG material,

the transmission and reﬂection take place through channels of frequencies (ω0±m ωs) with

m = 0, 1, 2, . . ..9 In the present calculations, we neglected the modes with m ≥ 2. The size

of the transmission and reﬂection matrices in the TM approach becomes, in this case, three

times as large as that for a bare PBG structure (i.e., in the absence of a SAW). Care has

been taken to remove numerical instability arising on account of the increase in the number

of forward steps and in the matrix dimensions. The method has been found to be stable

even for structures containing as much as 300 PBG unit cells in a SAW wavelength. The

details of this calculational procedure will be published elsewhere.10

For ease of fabrication, we considered thin and planar structures, which can be grown

with the current molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) technology. The composition and thickness

of the layers as well as the total size of the layer stack were varied so as to enhance the

interaction between light of wavelength of 940 nm and a SAW with λs = 5.6 µm. The

electric ﬁeld concentration in the cavity is crucial for the enhancement of AO interaction.

We found that the modulation is the largest when the cavity is placed close to, but not

exactly at the center of the Bragg mirror structure. One possible structure is shown in

Fig. 1. It is a 40-period asymmetric Bragg structure with a GaAs cavity near the center.

The ﬁrst 21 periods are alternating AlAs and GaAs layers with thicknesses of 76.9 nm and

65.5 nm, respectively, followed by the 142.4 nm-thick GaAs cavity and the second mirror,

which has 18 periods with the same composition as the ﬁrst Bragg mirror. This structure

exhibits a forbidden gap of 117 nm (from 865 nm to 983 nm), as shown in the spectrum of

its transmission coeﬃcient in Fig. 2. The cavity states are located near 940 nm and have a

full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 0.5 nm. Although this design is for operation

3

near 940 nm, the structure can be easily scaled for other operation frequencies.

In our calculations, we assumed that the SAW creates a sinusoidal modulation of the

dielectric constant, as shown in Fig. 1, with a peak value for the relative modulation of the

dielectric function ∆ǫ/ǫ = 6 × 10−4. From calculations of the SAW strain ﬁeld, we deter-

mined that these dielectric modulation levels can be generated in GaAs/AlAs multilayers

by conventional IDTs excited with a 500 MHz radio-frequency power of 20 mW. In Fig. 3,

the calculated transmission coeﬃcients through the central channel [t(ω0), dots] and side

channels [t(ω0 ± ωs), squares] are compared with that obtained in the absence of a SAW

[t0, open circles]. The inter- and the intra-channel scattering modes induced by the SAW

have negligible intensities except at frequencies very close to the cavity states, where the

AO interaction is strong. Although the transmission occurs through these three frequencies,

the channels are separated only by a very small frequency ωs<<ω0. In experiments, the

observed transmission coeﬃcient will thus be the sum of the contributions from all three

channels. Hence, the CR is deﬁned as the ratio of t0 to [t(ω0)+t(ω0+ωs)+t(ω0-ωs)] and plot-

ted as a dashed line in Fig. 3. A maximum CR of about 4 can be obtained. The dielectric

modulation ∆ǫ, which depends on the square root of the acoustic power,11−13 can be further

increased by improving the IDT design. Previous calculations for a speciﬁc design13 within

the GaAs/(Al,Ga)As system show that much larger ∆ǫ/ǫ ratios (of up to 2.3%) are possible.

To investigate the operation of the switch under theses conditions, we show in Fig. 4 the

calculated CRs for various values of ∆ǫ/ǫ. CR increases almost quadratically with ∆ǫ/ǫ,

reaching values as high as 300 for ∆ǫ/ǫ = 0.6% (corresponding to a relative refractive index

change of 0.3%).

Layer size ﬂuctuations inherently present in MBE growth may aﬀect the properties of

the Bragg mirrors and deteriorate the contrast ratio. This eﬀect was modeled by assuming

that the dielectric constants ﬂuctuated randomly within 5% of their original values. We

found that the highest CR decreases from 300 to 240. In addition, the central frequency

may shift as the cavity thickness changes.

Although the structure proposed here can be grown by the MBE method, an unconven-

4

tional placement of the IDT for SAW generation may be required. Since the dimensions

of IDT for high frequency SAWs (>1 GHz) can be signiﬁcantly reduced below a mm, we

suggest its placement on the side of the substrate, as shown in Fig. 5. In this conﬁguration,

both the SAW and the light beams travel along the direction perpendicular to the layer

stack. Recent developments of electron-beam lithography and of imprint techniques14 for

IDT fabrication may make such an arrangement possible. Another possibility is to generate

the SAW on a highly piezoelectric material, such as LiNbO3 or ZnO, and then to couple it

to the device structure on GaAs employing wafer bonding techniques.

While the cavity design leads to large CR values, it has a limited frequency tunability,

because of the δ-function-like distribution of defect modes. A wider tunability range can

be achieved if the SAW interacts with propagating light modes lying outside the forbidden

gap of the Bragg mirror. The strength of the AO interaction, however, is considerably

weaker for these extended modes.9,15 While operating near the zone edge might improve the

AO coupling (because of the reduced light group velocity), longer SAW wavelengths and,

consequently, longer interaction paths will be needed to ensure wave vector conservation.

For shorter switches, such as the one based on the one-dimensional Bragg stack, it is clear

that one has to work in a band with extremely small dispersion in order to achieve large

light modulation eﬃciencies.

The major advantages of the optical switch proposed here are the potentially very high

on/oﬀ CRs, sub-µs switching times, and extremely small sizes. The frequency tunability

(selection of ω0) is limited to a sub-nm range deﬁned by the cavity states. If more cavity

states are introduced to increase the energy width and the tunability range, the strength

of the AO interaction will be reduced. The latter may be compensated by increasing the

number of layer stacks. The growth of high-quality Bragg mirrors by MBE, however, is

restricted to a maximum stack thickness of a few microns.

In conclusion, we have used an extended version of the TM approach to calculate the

changes in the transmission spectra induced by SAWs in PBG crystals. We show that a

large modulation of light can be achieved in a one-dimensional Bragg stack with a cavity.

If the acoustic power can be increased to cause a 0.30% change in the refractive index near

the cavity in the PBG structure, CRs of the order of a few hundred can be achieved through

the AO eﬀect.

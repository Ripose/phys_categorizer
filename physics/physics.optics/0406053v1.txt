A method to reconstruct weakly anisotropic inhomogeneous dielectric tensors inside a transpar-
ent medium is proposed. The mathematical theory of Integral Geometry is cast into a workable
framework which allows the full determination of dielectric tensor ﬁelds by scalar Radon inver-
sions of the polarization transformation data obtained from six planar tomographic scanning cycles.
Furthermore, a careful derivation of the usual equations of integrated photoelasticity in terms of
heuristic length scales of the material inhomogeneity and anisotropy is provided, making the paper
a self-contained account about the reconstruction of arbitrary three-dimensional, weakly anisotropic
dielectric tensor ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

The inverse boundary value problem of recovery of anisotropic spatially varying electromagnetic properties of a
medium from external measurements at a ﬁxed frequency is among the most mathematically challenging of inverse
problems. For low-frequency electromagnetic measurements where a static approximation is valid, an anisotropic
dielectric tensor or conductivity tensor is uniquely determined by complete surface electrical measurements up to
a gauge condition[1]. For isotropic[2] and chiral isotropic media[3] a knowledge of all pairs of tangential electric
and magnetic ﬁelds at the boundary, for a single non-exceptional frequency, is known to be suﬃcient to recover the
material properties. Anisotropic materials are important in many practical problems with anisotropy arising from,
for example, ﬂow, deformation, crystal or liquid crystal structure, and eﬀective anisotropic properties arising from
homogenization of ﬁbrous or layered composite materials. For general anisotropic media the question of suﬃciency of
data for reconstruction remains open.

In this paper we concentrate on a speciﬁc high-frequency case of considerable practical importance. We assume that
the material is non-magnetic, i.e. has a homogeneous and isotropic permeability equal to the vacuum value µ0; that
the conductivity is negligible; and that the permittivity, or dielectric tensor, is weakly anisotropic in a sense that will be
deﬁned below. We present a mathematical framework which allows us to invert the polarization transformation data
obtained from tomographic measurements of light rays passing through an optically anisotropic material at suﬃciently
many angles for the six independent components of the (spatially varying) dielectric tensor ǫij inside the specimen. It
will be shown that, for weak anisotropy, our method allows the full determination of all tensor components, provided
that tomographic measurements are made for six carefully chosen orientations of the planes in which the light rays
scan the medium.

The equations describing the passage of light through inhomogeneous and weakly anisotropic media have been for-
mulated in Refs. 4–6, and in section II we shall show how to obtain these equations from a geometric-optical starting
point by expanding the electric ﬁeld in powers of appropriate length scales which describe the inhomogeneity and
anisotropy of the medium. Also, a condition for “weak” anisotropy will be speciﬁed upon which we shall linearize
(section IV) the equations determining the polarization transfer matrix along the light rays. In section V we then
present our method of reconstructing the permittivity tensor in the linearized limit by performing scalar Radon trans-
forms on the polarization transformation data obtained from six scanning cycles on diﬀerent planes intersecting the
specimen. In section VI the method is demonstrated by giving a visual example of reconstruction of the permittivity
tensor inside an axially loaded cylindrical bar: in this case, the stress tensor in the (transparent) medium gives rise to
optical anisotropy, and it will be seen that our method works well in the limit of weak anisotropy. The mathematical
basis for this method has been anticipated in the seminal work of Sharafutdinov[7], whose book contains a general
theory of “ray transforms” of tensor ﬁelds on n-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and an examination into the possibility
to invert them for reconstructing the underlying tensor ﬁelds. Our work presented here is an adaption, and par-
tial reformulation, of this highly mathematical framework, to the speciﬁc objective of reconstructing inhomogeneous
dielectric tensor ﬁelds via optical tomography.

It should be mentioned that the determination of anisotropic dielectric tensors as presented here has a closely related
variant in the problem of reconstruction of a stress tensor ﬁeld inside a loaded transparent material; the phenomenon
that an initially isotropic medium becomes optically anisotropic when under strain is called Photoelasticity [8–12] and
may be used to obtain information about the internal stress in a strained medium from polarization transformation

data obtained by tomographical methods. The photoelastic eﬀect as a means to retrieve information about internal
stresses has been studied extensively: A method termed “Integrated Photoelasticity”[13–17] is well-known, and it
was pointed out[18–21] that information about the diﬀerence of principal stress components could be retrieved from
appropriate Radon transformations of polarization transformation data. However, these methods do not succeed in
reconstructing the stress components separately and therefore the full stress tensor, and the linearly related dielectric
tensor, can be obtained in this way only for systems exhibiting a certain degree of symmetry, such as an axial
symmetry. Other methods of reconstruction have been suggested, for example, a three-beam measurement scheme[22],
where for axisymmetric systems an onion-peeling reconstruction algorithm was proposed[23, 24]. Another method,
which in principle is capable of determining a general three-dimensional permittivity tensor, is the “load incremental
approach”[25]. Here, the stress on the object is increased in small increments, and at each step, a measurement cycle
is performed.

The new results in this paper are twofold: Firstly, we derive the set of equations determining the polarization transfer
matrices for a given light ray scanning the object. These equations are somewhat related to the standard equations
of integrated photoelasticity[14], but here we present a more rigorous exposition of the heuristic length scales[6], and
the approximations based thereupon, which underlie the usual derivation of these equations from Maxwell’s equations
in a material medium; this is done in sections II, III and IV. Secondly, we present a novel scheme for reconstruction
of arbitrarily inhomogeneous dielectric tensors in the interior of the specimen, subject only to the condition that the
birefringence is “weak” in a sense which will be speciﬁed in sections V and VI.

II. HEURISTIC LENGTH SCALES

It is assumed that the material is non-absorbing for optical wavelengths, and furthermore is non-magnetic, µij =
µ0δij , where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum. As for the permittivity we assume that the dielectric tensor
deviates “weakly” from a global spatial average

ǫ =

,

ZB

i=1 ǫii is the trace operation, and ǫ = ǫ(x) is the dielectric
where B denotes the body having a volume vol B, tr ǫ =
tensor. In a zero-order approximation the material therefore may be regarded as homogeneously isotropic, with scalar
P
dielectric constant ǫ as deﬁned in (1). Typically, this behaviour of weak deviation from a homogeneously isotropic
background will be satisﬁed for glasses and certain resins under moderate internal stress or external load. The scalar
constant of permittivity ǫ will be a reference quantity when we specify the dimensionless degree of anisotropy in
eq. (8).

For the actual problems relevant to our work, the length scales characterising inhomogeneities in the material
are much larger than the wavelength of the (monochromatic) light passing through the object, so that the usage of
geometric-optical approximations is justiﬁed. Heuristically, two such length scales can be conceptualized[6]: A scale
l0 characterising the degree of inhomogeneity may be introduced by

where κ denotes a unit vector in the direction of wave propagation. Furthermore, in any anisotropic medium, two
preferred polarization directions ep(x), p = 1, 2, for each given direction of wave propagation[26–30], exist at each
point, so that a scale lp measuring the rate of variation in these polarization directions can be speﬁcied by

These scales should be compared to the average wavelength λ of the monochromatic light passing through the medium,
so that, when the limit

where β is an appropriate number characterising the magnitude of the components of the dimensionless anisotropy
tensor Aij , such as a global maximum, etc. If anisotropy is not weak, then at each point in the medium we have a
continuous splitting of rays due to the fact that there are two distinct phase velocities, and two distinct ray velocities,
for any given propagation direction. A condition for weak anisotropy therefore arises if we demand that the passage
of light through the material can be described by a single ray which is inﬂuenced by the local variations of the
optical tensors only in the way that the polarization directions rotate. This is the situation that commonly occurs in
photoelasticity and is also of greatest interest to our work.

It was shown by FKN[6] that ray splitting can be ignored, if

In this case[6] “it is impossible to discriminate experimentally between split rays”, and one can eﬀectively replace the
two rays by a single isotropic ray which is obtained from the isotropic part of the dielectric tensor alone. This is indeed
the domain we are most concerned with, since experimentally no ray splitting is seen in photoelastic experiments. In
fact, for those applications we are interested in it is usually true that light propagates along straight lines through
the specimen, so that the trial solution (5) may be replaced by an even stronger ansatz

with constant wave vector k, just as for a plane wave. The phase velocity associated with this wave vector is the one
associated with the average permittivity ǫ deﬁned in eq. (1),

III. EQUATIONS SATISFIED BY THE TRANSFER MATRICES

The information about the change in the state of polarization of a light beam passing through the material is
encoded in a two-dimensional unitary transfer matrix. The equation satisﬁed by the transfer matrix along a light ray
is given in most accounts on photoelastic tomography[18–24], but the various approximations taken in the process

The transfer matrix U is unitary and thus preserves the norm of the complex electric ﬁeld vector. Physically this
means that intensity is preserved, so unitarity here just expresses energy conservation of the light ray. This must
indeed be the case, since we have assumed a non-absorbing medium.

IV. THE LINEARIZED INVERSE PROBLEM

The transfer matrices U may be obtained by measuring the change of polarization state along each light ray
passing through the medium at many diﬀerent angles. By measuring three so-called characteristic parameters[13] the
transfer matrices U can be computed using the Poincar´e equivalence theorem[31], a matrix decomposition theorem
which allows to interprete the characteristic parameters as the retardation angle ∆, the angle of the fast axis θ, and
the rotation angle φ of an equivalent optical model consisting of a linear retarder and a rotator with these optical
parameters. The Poincar´e equivalence theorem can be formulated in terms of Jones matrices or Stokes parameters
on the Poincar´e sphere; a contemporary exposition of these relations was given recently in Ref. 32.

Assuming that the transfer matrices U have been determined for suﬃciently many light rays scanning the medium,
the associated inverse problem now consists in reconstructing the anisotropy tensor Aij from the collection of these
transfer matrices; this inverse problem is obviously non-linear in Aij , as can be seen from eqs. (21 and 22). The
solution to the fully non-linear problem is not known as yet. However, in the quasi-isotropic regime we can deal with
the linearized inverse problem: this is deﬁned by a truncation of the Born-Neumann series in (22) after the ﬁrst-order
term

10−6 m and assuming a length of

V. SOLUTION OF THE LINEARIZED INVERSE PROBLEM BY SIX SCALAR RADON INVERSIONS

We now show that the linearized inverse problem can be reduced to six scalar Radon inversions performed on the
3 which intersects the specimen and contains
polarization transformation data. We ﬁrst specify a plane P (y, η) in R
the point y; the orientation of the plane is determined by a unit vector η normal to the plane. Consider the straight
y + tκ with unit vector κ lying in P (y, η), describing a light ray passing through the specimen and lying
line t
in the given plane P (y, η). Let ξ be a third unit vector, orthogonal to κ and η in such a way that (ξ, η, κ) form a
right-handed system. Then the equation describing the polarization transformation along the light ray in the direction
κ is given by the analogue of (23),

The measurement of characteristic parameters determines the transfer matrix on the left-hand side of (24). We now
repeat these measurements for all lines lying in the given plane P (y, η) and thus obtain a collection of line integrals
for the normal component Aηη in P ,

for any pair of directions κ and ξ; we could extend the limits of integration in (25) to
, since in practical situations
the object will be placed inside a tank with a phase-matching ﬂuid, hence the value of Aij outside the object is zero.
The set of line integrals in (25), taken for all light rays in P , is called the transverse ray transform[7] of Aij with
respect to η.

±∞

However, the component Aηη = A(η, η) is perpendicular to the plane P and is therefore invariant under SO(2)
rotations in that plane, so that it behaves like any other scalar function deﬁned on P . It follows that the collection
of integrals (25) is indeed the standard 2D Radon transform[33] of the scalar function Aηη(x), x
P (y, η), and
hence can be inverted for the component Aηη using any numerical scheme for Radon inversion appropriate to the
circumstances, such as ﬁltered back-projection[34]. This produces the component Aηη(x) for every point x in the
plane P (y, η).

∈

On repeating the same process for all planes parallel to P (y, η) we reconstruct the component Aηη within the whole

specimen.

6

(26a)

(26b)

(27)

(29)

We now perform this procedure for the following six diﬀerent choices of the vector η:

η1 = e1

η12 =

e1 + e2
√2

,

, η3 = e3
e3 + e3

, η23 =

, η31 =

e3 + e1

.

The scan-and-reconstruction cycle for the choices in (26a) produces components

A11

, A22

, A33

of the anisotropy tensor. On the other hand, for the choices in (26b) we obtain the following result: Let us focus
attention on the ﬁrst orientation η12, where the associated reconstruction gives us the tensor component A(η12, η12)
everywhere within the object. But, due to the fact that the tensor is linear in its arguments, this component can be
expressed in the form

A(η12, η12) =

(A11 + A22) + A12

,

2

where we have used the fact that Aij is symmetric and hence A21 = A12. Thus, having already reconstructed A11
and A22 everywhere in the specimen, we can immediately compute A12 from the reconstructed values of A(η12, η12)
using eq. (28). On repeating this process for the last two choices of η in (26b) we see that all six tensor components
of Aij can be reconstructed in this way.

If the average dielectric constant ǫ of the object is known we can compute the full dielectric tensor ǫij immediately

using the deﬁnition (8a). On the other hand, if ǫ is not determined we can still use (8a) to write

in other words, we can reconstruct ǫij up to a scale factor ǫ; this may still produce valuable information about the
internal structure of the dielectric material, see Fig. 1.

ǫij = ǫ (Aij + δij)

,

VI. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE

Here we present a numerical example of reconstruction of a single tensor component Aηη for a plane intersecting
the object at an oblique angle. The polarization transformation data are obtained from an artiﬁcial stress model of a
cylindrical bar with a circular cross-section which is subject to axial load and in turn bulges out in the middle section,
see Fig. 1(a).

Based on these artiﬁcial forward data we then employ our method and reconstruct the “normal” component Aηη on
a plane passing through the center of the cylinder and making an angle of 22◦ with the symmetry axis, see Fig. 1(b).
The original plot of Aηη in this plane is shown in Fig. 1(c); the reconstructed image in Fig. 1(d) has 254
254 pixels,
assuming that 36 scans, one scan on every 5◦, have been performed in the plane. It will be seen that the reconstruction
contains artefacts which are typical of a Radon inversion; they can be reduced by increasing the number of scans, e.g.,
by performing one scan on each degree, for a total of 180 scans. The result in this case is almost indistinguishable
from the original in Fig. 1(c) so that we have refrained from showing it.

For the inverse Radon transformation, the Matlab function iradon has been used which utilizes a ﬁltered back-

×

projection algorithm[34].

VII. SUMMARY

We have presented a novel way to reconstruct an arbitrarily inhomogeneous anisotropic dielectric tensor inside a
transparent non-absorbing medium, under the conditions that the birefringence is a deviation from a homogeneous
isotropic average, and that this deviation is weak. It was shown that the associated linearized inverse problem of
reconstructing the dielectric tensor from polarization transformation data gathered by optical-tomographical means
can be reduced to six scalar Radon inversions which allow the determination of the permittivity tensor completely. We
also supplied a more rigorous derivation of the usual equations of integrated photoelasticity which deﬁne the inverse
problem for the dielectric tensor; our exposition was based on a careful description of the various approximations that
enter the derivation of the photoelasticity equations from Maxwell’s equations in a material medium.

Eﬀective Second Order Susceptibility in Photonic Crystals Composed from
Centro-Symmetric Materials

A technique for obtaining eﬃcient bulk second order susceptibility in non centro-symmetric
Photonic Crystals (PC) made from centro-symmetric materials is discussed. The eﬀect is based
on the electric quadrupole eﬀect, strong electromagnetic mode deformation and non homogeneous
contribution to volume polarization from diﬀerent parts of the PC. The required symmetry breaking
is introduced on the macroscale of the PC unit cell. The obtained structural χ(2)
str is comparable with
the second order susceptibility of ordinary non-linear materials. Phase matching can be achieved
by introducing symmetry modulation (Quasi Phase Matching) during fabrication of the PC.

Optical materials with high second order susceptibil-
ity χ(2) are frequently required for both fundamental and
applied research. By utilizing three wave interactions in
such media, existing coherent radiation sources can be
extended to almost the entire optical spectrum. Conse-
quently the importance of these materials can be com-
pared with the importance of laser itself.

The number of eﬃcient second order nonlinear materi-
als is limited. To possess second order susceptibility the
material has to be non-centro-symmetric. This imme-
diately eliminates all amorphous materials and crystals
from 11 of 32 symmetry classes. The choice between
remaining materials is also limited due to diﬀerent con-
straints: value of χ(2), absorption in required spectrum,
damage threshold etc.

Diﬀerent methods were proposed for development of
enhanced non-linearity. The ﬁrst is the search for new
materials with large non-linear response on molecular or
molecular arrangement [1] scales. The second is construc-
tion of composite materials [2]. In this case the eﬀective
enhancement is achieved due to redistribution of the en-
ergy inside composite structure. Unfortunately it can im-
prove only χ(3), and not χ(2). Recently the use of Pho-
tonic Band Gap (PBG) crystals made from non-linear
materials was proposed [3], [4]. All these methods require
symmetry breaking on microscopic atomic or molecular
dimensions.

In this Letter we describe a technique for obtaining eﬃ-
cient second order susceptibility in non centro-symmetric
Photonic Crystals (PC) made from centro-symmetric
materials. The eﬀect is based on the electric quadrupole
transition, strong electromagnetic mode deformation and
diﬀerent contributions to the volume polarization from
diﬀerent parts of the PC. The required symmetry break-
ing is introduced on the macroscale of the PC unit cell.
A local second order polarization P (2) can be obtained
in centro-symmetric materials due to the quadrupole ef-
fect [5]. In quadrupole transitions the required symme-
try breaking is obtained by asymmetry of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld spatial mode, rather than the asymmetry
of the electron wave function as in the dipole transition
case. The second order polarization corresponding to a
quadrupole transition is:

−→E

(1)

where Q is a fourth-order tensor. Generally integration
over the volume of such point polarization vanishes, due
to periodicity of −→E and gradient dependence of P (2)
Q .
Usually, only some weak signals from interfaces can be
detected [6], [7], however the situation in PCs can be
quite diﬀerent.

PCs are artiﬁcial two or three dimensional periodic
dielectric structures [8], [9]. They possess unique opti-
cal properties for electromagnetic radiation with wave-
lengths comparable with their period, including the ex-
istence of full PBGs, anomalously strong dispersion [10]
and high photon localization near defects [11]. High di-
electric constant modulation is required to obtain strong
eﬀects, so several technologies for construction of dielec-
tric/air 2D [12], [13] and 3D [14], [15], [16] PCs have been
developed.

Integration of eq. (1) over the volume in dielectric/air
PC can be diﬀerent from zero. The reason is unequal
contributions to the polarization from diﬀerent parts of
the media. The polarization of the air regions can be to-
tally neglected due to low electron density. Constructing
PC in such a way that in dielectric part the P (2)
Q has one
sign and in the air the opposite, eﬀective ”structural”
volume polarization can be obtained.

second order susceptibility at least of the same order of
magnitude as low second order coeﬃcient uniform mate-
rials (e.g. quartz). The result may be even larger due to
stronger modulation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in PC
than at an ordinary interface and due to the inﬂuence of
photonic band structure on electron transitions [4].

the hollow cavities, partially ﬁlled with the substrate’s
material, are the best candidates for proposed method.

Let us now consider some speciﬁc example (see Fig. 2):
Optical Parametric Oscillations (OPO) in a lattice of
1D defects (hollow waveguides) in 2D PBG environment.
Such waveguides array can be fabricated using semicon-
ductor lithography technology. To obtain a 2D PBG
crystal, a hexagonal pattern of deep air columns can be
etched in the high refractive index substrate, e.g. Si.
During the same lithographic step the waveguides can be
introduced by etching parallel stripes. Using quasicrys-
talline arrangement of air columns instead of hexagonal
pattern, 2D PBG can be achieved in lower index materi-
als, e.g. glass [19].

FIG. 1. 1D defect lattice, with lattice constant L, in Pho-
tonic Band Gap (PBG) environment. A single defect in PBG
environments can possess localized modes for frequencies in-
side the gap. This means that for the same frequencies in
periodic lattices of defects the mode can be not localized, but
strongly modulated. l is the characteristic modulation length.

A speciﬁc realization of the desired material requires

PCs with highly modulated electromagnetic mode.
can be achieved directly in some PCs, e.g. high mode
modulation was predicted for silicon inverse opal struc-
ture [18], or by introducing periodic defects into the PBG
substrate. The ﬁrst approach may be realized using lower
index materials, because the requirement for PBG does
not exist. Unfortunately there were no intensive numeri-
cal search for photonic structures with high mode modu-
lations and at these moment PCs of this type are not well
explored. In contrast PBG crystals require high refrac-
tive index materials, but there are many known struc-
tures and almost any defect (extra or missing material,
deviation from the periodicity) possesses localized modes
for frequencies inside the gap, leading to modulated mode
structure (see Fig. 1).

Also in the latter approach the required asymmetry
can be achieved by proper defect’s design. Independent
of the PBG substrate the defects should be asymmetric
and possess dielectric/air structure.
In the case when
the electromagnetic mode is omnidirectional in dielectric
part of the defect, the maximum volume contribution of

FIG. 2. Periodic lattice of waveguides (the size of each
waveguide is l ≈ 2πc/ω) in 2D PBG crystal, and the TE
electromagnetic mode structure inside it. The mode is modu-
lated due to the strong decay of electromagnetic ﬁeld in PBG
crystals. The photonic crystal (PC) is non centro-symmetric
due to partially dielectric ﬁlling of waveguides. Guiding waves
in such waveguides is an intrinsic property of PBG crystals.
The ﬁgure is a top view of the proposed 2D photonic crysal
and can be considered as an image of the lithography mask,
required for its fabrication.

Inversion symmetry breaking is achieved by partial
waveguide ﬁlling. It can be done by leaving an unetched
stripe near each etched one(see Fig. 2). The possibil-
ity to guide electromagnetic modes in such waveguides
is intrinsic property of PBG crystals. Guiding in PBG
crystals has no crucial dependence on the internal waveg-
uide’s structure, as in index guided modes, because the
conﬁnement of the electromagnetic mode exists only due
to the external PBG environment.

Three electromagnetic waves (each TE mode): pump,
signal and idler, propagate along the waveguides direc-
tions. Let us assume that pump and signal have almost
degenerate frequencies ω and ω
∆ω inside the forbidden
gap. The idler’s frequency ∆ω is assumed to be outside
the gap (see Fig. 2).

Under the assumption that the idler wavelength is

sumption the modes of pump and signal can be taken
to be identical with some maximum E(p)

tric/air interface inside the waveguide and zeros on its

in eq. (4) does not depend on the exact electromagnetic
mode distribution, but on the ﬁeld value at the boundary
points of integration. The integral is tacken only over the
ﬁlled part of the waveguide and can be evaluated analyt-

For eﬃcient conversion phase matching has to occur,
∆k = 0 in eq. (4). Otherwise the signal from diﬀerent
points along the propagation will interfere destructively.
Generally in most materials this condition can be inﬂu-
enced only by change of the propagation direction.

Phase matching can be achieved artiﬁcially by periodic
modulation of the sign of the non-linear tensor coeﬃcient.
It can be achieved in ferroelectric crystals only by peri-
odic poling. The method is called Quasi Phase Matching
In non centro-symmetric PCs modulation of the
[22].
non-linear coeﬃcient can be introduced during fabrica-
tion (see Fig. 3).

FIG. 3. Realization of Quasi Phase Matching in PCs for
second order non-linear processes, 2π/Λ = ∆k. The phase
matching is achieved by period modulation of the asymme-
try’s direction. It can be done by mask modiﬁcation during
lithography step. In 3D the task can be completed by lithog-
raphy multilayer construction. The desired asymmetrically
ﬁlled cavity can be constructed by changing the defect’s im-
age from negative to positive in diﬀerent layers.

These results can be extended to the general case of
periodic lattice defects inside a PBG Crystal. As it was
stated earlier single defects in PBG environments can
possess localized modes for frequencies inside the gap.
This means that for the same frequencies in periodic
lattices of defects the mode can be not localized, but
strongly modulated. Assuming that the electric ﬁeld near
0, due
the defects is Emax and between them is Emin ≈
to eq. (1) the scaling for structural polarization is:

P (2)
str ∝ |

Q

|

maxlN −1

(10)

where l is the eﬀective localization length of the mode and
N is the dimension of the defect’s lattice. This result is
valid for the optimal case of ﬁeld distribution, e.g. as in
the previously considered example. The dimension of the
defect lattice can be smaller than the space dimension.

The periodicity of the entire crystal implies translational
symmetry along all unconﬁned coordinates. Hence these
coordinates can be omitted (see Fig. 1).

The ”structural” polarization has to be compared with

the ordinary one:

where L is the defect lattice constant. The ratio between
Emax and Emean can be determined taking into account
that the total energies of the compared modes has to be
equal, similarly to eq. (7):

The additional numerical coeﬃcient βoverlap corre-
sponds to imperfect overlap of diﬀerent modes [23]. In
case of three wave interactions its scaling can be deter-
mined from eqs. (10, 11, 12) to be:

βoverlap ≈

1

(14)

in the case of all waves being conﬁned. Practically
this can be diﬃcult due to the ﬁnite forbidden gap
in PCs.

(15)

where N is the dimension of the defect’s lattice. For
N = 1 results (13) and (9) are equivalent. The obtained
results are not limited to mode modulation by defects
lattice, but the same formulae can be applied in the case
of ”pure” PC strong mode modulation [18].

PC ﬁbers [24] and so called ”Super Mirror” [25] waveg-
uides are other good candidates for implementation of
second order non-linear processes based on an electric
quadrupole transition. They are suited for guiding
light mode in the air, consequently the partial ﬁlling of
these waveguides can provide eﬀective second order non-
linearity. Recently very interesting non-linear processes
were observed in air/silica microstructure optical ﬁbers
[26]. Three dimensional defects are also highly interest-
ing due to the analogy between 3D defects and molecules.
All these cases require more extensive numerical investi-
gation.

The measurement of the eﬀects value can be completed
by light propagation inside a properly designed PC, e.g.
in the proposed waveguide’s array structure, or by light
scattering from the surface of PC. In this case bulk and
surface non-linearities can be distinguished by contribu-
tion of diﬀerent light polarizations to the signal. In the
case of surface non-linearity of centro-symmetric mate-
rials the tangential component of electromagnetic ﬁeld

does not contribute to generated harmonics of incident
light.

Integrated optics is one of the possible applications for
structural χ(2)
str materials. Use of standard non-linear ma-
terials in integrated optics is diﬃcult. Generally integra-
tion is either impossible due to incompatibility of dif-
ferent processes or expensive. The most convenient are
polymers, but several speciﬁc disadvantages (e.g.
life-
time) prevent their broad use. The method described
above opens new possibilities for incorporating non-linear
elements in optical chips by e.g. obtaining eﬀective non-
linearity from the chip substrate itself.

It was shown that a non centro-symmetric PC, made
from substrates without bulk second order nonlinearity
(amorphous materials or centrosymmetric crystals) can
posses eﬀective volume χ(2) comparable with the second
order susceptibility of ordinary nonlinear materials. The
eﬀect is based on the electric quadrupole transition and
local enhancement of
−→E . The symmetry breaking is
introduced on the macroscale of the unit cell of the PC,
instead of atomic scale. The estimations were made for
λ = 1µm, and for smaller wavelengths the non-linearity
should be stronger. Quasi Phase Matching can be intro-
duced in the time of fabrication, so eﬀective non-linear
processes are feasible.

We study the eﬀect of disorder on the eﬀective magnetic response of composite left-handed meta-
materials and their speciﬁc properties such as negative refraction. We show that relatively weak
disorder in the split-ring resonators can reduce and even completely eliminate the frequency domain
where the composite material demonstrates the left-handed properties. We introduce the concept
of the order parameter to describe novel physics of this eﬀect.

Recently fabricated composite structures [1, 2, 3] open
an unique possibility to study experimentally the prop-
erties of the so-called left-handed metamaterials [4].
Speciﬁcally, the composite materials created by arrays
of wires and split-ring resonators (SRRs) are known to
possess a negative real part of the magnetic permeabil-
ity and negative dielectric permittivity in the microwave
range [1, 2, 3], and they demonstrate many unusual prop-
erties predicted theoretically long time ago [4], includ-
ing negative refraction,
inverse light pressure, reverse
Doppler and Vavilov-Cherenkov eﬀects, etc. Moreover,
many ideas to create such left-handed metamaterials for
optical frequencies are currently under study (see, e.g.,
Ref. [5]).

The metamaterials created by arrays of metallic wires
and microwave resonators are designed to operate for the
wavelengths much larger then the period of the struc-
ture, and their simultaneously negative dielectric per-
mittivity and magnetic permeability occur in some ﬁ-
nite frequency range. Within the eﬀective medium ap-
proximation, dielectric permittivity becomes negative in
a relatively large frequency domain due to a linear re-
sponse of wires, whereas magnetic permeability of the
structure can become negative in a relatively narrow
frequency domain. It is this speciﬁc frequency domain
where the induced magnetic momentum of each resonator
is directed opposite to the external magnetic ﬁeld being
strong enough to produce collectively negative values of
the eﬀective magnetic permeability.

In this Letter, we study the eﬀect of weak disorder
in the structure parameters on the magnetic response
of composite and the existence of the frequency domain
where the composite material exhibits the speciﬁc left-
handed properties such as negative refraction. We show
that even relatively small variation of the SRR param-
eters can result in the dramatic decrease of the size of
the left-handed frequency domain and, above a certain
threshold value, disorder can suppress and even eliminate
completely the left-handed properties of the metamate-
rial.

We study a composite structure made of metallic wires
and single-ring microwave resonators, as shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 1(a). This model is qualitatively similar to
the model of double-ring resonators usually studied in the
theory of left-handed composite media (see, e.g., Ref. [6]

and reference therein). Within the eﬀective medium ap-
proximation, the dielectric permittivity of this structure
can be calculated [7, 8] and presented in the form

ǫeﬀ (ω) ≈ 1 −

where ωp = 2πc/d ln (d/rw), d is the size of the unit cell,
rw is the radius of a metallic grid, γe = c2/2σS ln (d/rw),
σ is conductivity of a wire, S is the eﬀective wire cross-
section, ω is the angular frequency, and c is the free-space
speed of light. Usually, the eﬀective plasma frequency,
fp = ωp/2π, is between 10 GHz and 15 GHz.

The most intriguing properties of the left-handed com-
posite metamaterials are due to a SRR response which
determines eﬀective magnetic permeability. Magnetiza-
tion of the metamaterial with three SRRs per unit cell,
each of them having the axis in the perpendicular di-
rection with respect to others as shown in Fig. 1(a),
can be presented in the form (see, e.g., Refs. [9, 10]),
M = χ(ω)H′, where

Results (2) and (3) are obtained under the major as-
sumption that all resonators in the structure are iden-
tical. Now we consider the case when the size of the
slot dg is random and it is characterized by a statistical
distribution function. Our study can be motivated by a
number of the recent eﬀorts to create the metamaterials
with the left-handed properties for shorter wavelengths
and, for the smaller SRR size in the structure, the key
parameters would be diﬃcult to control in fabrication.
In our structure, the parameter η does not depend on
dg [see Eq. (3)], and only the SRR eigenfrequency ω0 is

the SRR eigenfrequencies, i.e.
standard case when all SRRs are identical, the distribu-
R
tion function can be represented as F (X) = δ(X − ω0).
To describe the coupling between the acting magnetic
ﬁeld H′ and the macroscopic magnetic ﬁeld H, we use
the Lorentz-Lorenz formula [11], H′ = H + (4π/3)M,
and present the eﬀective magnetic permeability in terms
of local magnetic susceptibility (4) as follows

For deﬁniteness, we consider the Lorenz-type distribution
of the SRR eigenfrequencies in the form

µeﬀ (ω) =

1 + (8π/3)χ(ω)
1 − (4π/3)χ(ω)

.

F (X) =

with a narrow width for Γ ≪ ω0 such that the eigenfre-
quencies of all resonators are close to some mean value ω0.
As a result, non-vanishing contributions to the integral
are given by the values of X in the vicinity of X = ω0,
and we introduce a new variable ∆, X = ω0 + ∆, where
|∆| ≪ ω0. We are interested in the behavior of the mag-
netic susceptibility in the vicinity of ω = ω0, and we
introduce ω = ω0 + Ω, where |Ω| ≪ ω0. In this approxi-
mation, Eq. (4) can be rewritten as

Using the contour integration, the integral in Eq. (7) can
be calculated explicitly, and the expression for the mag-
netic susceptibility can be obtained in the following form:

χ(Ω) =

(−Ω + i¯Γ)

,

(8)

where ¯Γ = Γ + γm/2. The result (8) shows that the ran-
dom variation of the SRR eigenfrequencies is equivalent
to some additional losses in the structure, and even for
an ideal case of lossless resonators, i.e., when γm = 0, the
composite structure with random variation of the SRR
frequencies possesses eﬀective losses. From the physical
point of view, such eﬀective losses resemble the collision-
less Landau damping in plasmas [12] caused by the pres-
ence of resonant particles and, simultaneously, it follows
from the Kramers-Kronig relations.

From Eqs. (5) and (8), we ﬁnd the frequency domain
where the real part of magnetic permeability becomes
negative, Ω1 < Ω < Ω2, where

and Γc = πηω0. Thus, the width of the frequency domain
of the negative eﬀective magnetic permeability is

(10)

The value Γc has the meaning of the critical losses in
the composite structure above which the domain with
negative values of the magnetic permeability disappears,
and the relative critical parameter Γc/ω0 depends only
on the structure of the composite. Taking the character-
istic values d = 0.5cm, a = 0.2cm, and r = 0.05cm, we
obtain Γc/ω0 = 0.046. This result indicates that even
for the case of lossless resonators, i.e. γm = 0, relative
ﬂuctuations of the SRR eigenfrequencies cannot exceed
4.6%. Accordingly, if the slot size is dg = 0.01cm, (then
ω0/2π = 9.6GHz) the critical variation can be estimated
as ∆dg ∼ 5µm. Existence of such a critical distribution
width places strict requirements on the manufacturing of
such materials. Although for microwaves such require-
ments can be easily met, they can result in substantial
experimental diﬃculties for shorter wavelengths. In par-
ticular, the recent proposal to fabricate left-handed meta-
materials in optics using nanowires and π-shaped parti-
cles
[5], would require an accuracy better than 5 nm,
that can be challenging for the existing technology.

We note that premeditative introduction of disorder
does not allow to increase the size of the left-handed fre-
quency domain for any type of the distribution function.

Such a conclusion has a simple physical explanation. In-
deed, disorder in the eigenfrequencies for any given SRR
density results in a decrease of the eﬀective number of
resonators, which contribute into the negative magneti-
zation. In the recent experiment [13], combining s-shaped
resonance particles, the authors fabricated the metama-
terial with two domains of the negative refraction. Using
the results obtained above, we may come to the con-
clusion that the total size of the frequency domain with
the negative magnetic permeability in the structure fab-
ricated in Ref. [13] is less than it would be for the meta-
material where all resonators are identical. Moreover,
using the resonators with several diﬀerent values of the
eigenfrequency can eliminate completely the left-handed
properties.

Reduction and complete suppression of the frequency
domain with negative magnetic permeability with a
growth of the value of ¯Γ can also be explained in a diﬀer-
ent way. Indeed, the left- and right-handed properties of
the metamaterial can be treated as two diﬀerent “phase
states” of the structure. Thus, a transition from one state
to the other can be interpreted as the phase transition
of the second kind. The parameter ¯Γ describes the eﬀect
of disorder in the structure, and it can be treated as ”ef-
fective temperature”. Such comparison is adequate since
the eﬀective temperature is determined as the width of
statistical frequency ﬂuctuations including both homoge-
neous and inhomogeneous line broadening. To describe
diﬀerent phase states of the structure, we introduce the
eﬀective order parameter, as is usually done in the the-
ory of phase transitions. In the absence of homogeneous
(γm = 0) and inhomogeneous (Γ = 0) SRR line broaden-
ing (i.e. in the absence of disorder), the metamaterial has
the maximum width of the left-handed domain, which
decreases and then disappears at the critical ”eﬀective
temperature” Γc termed as the temperature of the phase
transition. We use the ratio of the left-handed frequency
range to the maximum left-handed frequency domain as
the order parameter,

ΨLH = ∆ΩLH/∆Ω(max)

LH = Re[1 − (¯Γ/Γc)2]1/2.

(11)

so that the metamaterial possesses the left-handed prop-
erties when ΨLH 6= 0, i.e., below the eﬀective critical tem-
perature Γc. Dependence of the order parameter ΨLH on

¯Γ is shown in Fig. 1(b). The real part of the magnetic
permeability as a function of the wave frequency is shown
in Fig. 2 for diﬀerent values of the ratio ¯Γ/Γc. For large
values of ¯Γ/Γc, the frequency domain where the material
possesses negative magnetic permeability is eliminated
due to disorder.

The result (11) suggests two ways for increasing
the width of the eﬀective frequency domain where the
composite material possesses the left-handed properties,
namely, (i) decreasing the eﬀective temperature ¯Γ, e.g.
by improving the manufacturing technology for shorter
wavelengths, and (ii) increasing the eﬀective critical tem-
perature Γc, e.g. by a design of the resonators.

Though the concept of the order parameter ΨLH does
not seem to be important in the context of the problem
under study, it is expected to be useful in other (e.g.
nonlinear) problems, when it becomes dependent on the
ﬁeld intensity, time, and coordinate.
In this case, the
order parameter will determine the material properties in
diﬀerent domains, describing the dynamics of the phase
transitions between the states with left- and right-handed
properties [8]. The study of the nonlinear regime will be
presented elsewhere.

In conclusion, we have analyzed the eﬀect of disor-
der in the composite structures which exhibit left-handed
properties. In particular, we have studied how random
variation of the SRR eigenfrequencies in the structure
can change the existence of the frequency domain where
the eﬀective dielectric permittivity and magnetic perme-
ability are both negative. We have demonstrated that
even relatively weak disorder in the SRR parameters can
result in a dramatic reduction of the size of the left-
handed frequency domain. More importantly, above a
certain threshold value of this disorder, the left-handed
frequency domain can disappear completely. We believe
our result provide a useful guide for a design of novel
types of metamaterials operating for shorter wavelengths
where the eﬀect of disorder is expected to be crucially
important.

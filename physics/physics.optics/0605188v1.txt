We study the electromagnetic surface waves localized at an interface separating a one-dimensional
photonic crystal and left-handed metamaterial, the so-called surface Tamm states. We demonstrate
that the metamaterial allows for a ﬂexible control of the dispersion properties of surface states, and
can support the Tamm states with a backward energy ﬂow and a vortex-like structure.

The study of unusual properties of left-handed meta-
materials is a rapidly developing ﬁeld of physics. Left-
handed metamaterial (LHM) is characterized by simulta-
neously negative eﬀective dielectric permittivity and neg-
ative eﬀective magnetic permeability, that gives rise to a
variety of unusual properties of electromagnetic waves.
Such materials have ﬁrst been suggested theoretically by
Veselago [1] almost 40 years ago, but they have been re-
alized experimentally only a few years ago [2]. Later, it
was shown that they possess many extraordinary wave-
guiding properties [3, 4, 5, 6]. In this Letter we demon-
strate another example of unusual properties of LHM and
study electromagnetic surface waves guided by an inter-
face between LHM and a one-dimensional photonic crys-
tal, the so-called surface Tamm states [7]. We demon-
strate that the presense of a metamaterial allows for a
ﬂexible control of the dispersion properties of surface
states, and the interface can support the Tamm states
with a backward energy ﬂow and a vortex-like structure.

Surface modes are a special type of waves localized at
an interface between two diﬀerent media. In periodic sys-
tems, staggered modes localized at surfaces are known as
Tamm states [7, 8], ﬁrst found in solid-state physics as
localized electronic states at the edge of a truncated peri-
odic potential. Surface states have been studied in many
diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics, including optics [9, 10], where
such waves are conﬁned to an interface between periodic
and homogeneous dielectric media, as well as nonlinear
dynamics of discrete chains [11]. In optics, the periodic
structures have to be manufactured artiﬁcially in order to
manipulate dispersion properties of light in a similar way
as the properties of electrons are controlled in crystals.
Such periodic dielectric structures are known as photonic
crystals. An analogy between solid-state physics and op-
tics suggests that surface electromagnetic waves should
exist at the interfaces of photonic crystals, and indeed
they were predicted theoretically [9, 10] and observed ex-
perimentally [12]. Such Tamm states can be very impor-
tant for applications of photonic crystals, as they allow
for the enhanced coupling of the electromagnetic waves
to and from the photonic crystal waveguides [13, 14].

In this Letter, we study surface electromagnetic waves,
or surface Tamm states, guided by an interface separating
homogeneous LHM and one-dimensional photonic crys-
tal. We assume that the terminating layer (or a cap layer)
of the periodic structure has the width diﬀerent from the

width of other layers of the structure. We study the
eﬀect of the width of this termination layer on surface
states, and explore a possibility to control the disper-
sion properties of surface waves by adjusting termination
layer thickness. We ﬁnd novel types of surface Tamm
states at the interface with the metamaterial which have
a backward energy ﬂow and a vortex-like structure. We
also compare our results with the case when the LHM
medium is replaced by a conventional dielectric, which
we refer to as right-handed material (RHM). The surface
states in these two cases we call left- and right-handed
Tamm states, respectively.

Geometry of our problem is sketched in Fig. 1. We con-
sider the propagation of TE-polarized waves described by
one component of the electric ﬁeld, E = Ey [15], and gov-
erned by a scalar Helmholtz-type equation. We look for
stationary solutions propagating along the interface with
the characterestic dependence ∼ exp [−iω(t − βx/c)],
where ω is an angular frequency, β is the normalized
wavenumber component along the interface, and c is the
speed of light, and present this equation in the form,

structure, the waves are the Bloch modes,

E(z) = Ψ(z) exp (iKbz),

(2)

where Kb is the Bloch wave number, and Ψ(z) is the
Bloch function which is periodic with the period of the
photonic structure (see details, e.g., in Ref. [16]). In the
periodic structure the waves will be decaying provided Kb
is complex; and this condition deﬁnes the spectral gaps
of an inﬁnite photonic crystal. For the calculation of
the Bloch modes, we use the well-known transfer matrix
method [16].

To ﬁnd the Tamm states, we take solutions of Eq. (1)
in a homogeneous medium and the Bloch modes in the
periodic structure and satisfy the conditions of continuity
of the tangential components of the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds at the interface between homogeneous medium and
periodic structure [17]. We summarize the dispersion
properties of the Tamm states in the ﬁrst and second
spectral gaps on the plane of the free-space wavenumber
k = ω/c versus the propagation constant β (see Fig. 2)
for diﬀerent values of the cap layer thickness dc. For com-
parison, we also plot the dispersion of the corresponding
Tamm states in the structure, where the homogeneous
medium is replaced by vacuum (dashed).

As mentioned above, the Tamm states exist in the gaps
of the photonic bandgap spectrum (unshaded regions in
Fig. 2). For a thin cap layer, dc = 0.01cm, the left-
handed Tamm state approaches the lower edge of the
ﬁrst (lower) band gap, while these right-handed Tamm
state approaches the top edge. Another important diﬀer-
ence between the two cases, is that for the LHM surface

modes the slope of the dispersion curve becomes negative
for small β, and it remains positive for larger longitudi-
nal wavenumbers (see the inset in Fig. 2), while for the
conventional dielectric media, the dispersion curves are
always with a positive slope. The slope of the dispersion
curve determines the corresponding group velocity of the
mode. The extended control over the group velocity in
the case of LHM bandgap structure is possible due to
the backward energy ﬂow in metamaterials. Similar ef-
fects have been already predicted for other types of the
wave guiding structures [5, 6]. Similarly, the left-handed
Tamm surface wave has a vortex-like energy ﬂow pattern.
As a result of diﬀerent slope of the dispersion curve
of the left-handed Tamm states, we observe the mode
degeneracy, i.e., for the same frequency ω (or wavenum-
ber k), there exist two modes with diﬀerent value of β.
The mode with lower β has a negative group velocity
(with respect to the propagation wavevector), while the
other mode has a positive group velocity. Such modes
are termed as backward and forward, respectively. In the
forward wave, the direction of the total energy ﬂow coin-
cides with the propagation direction, while in the back-
ward wave the energy ﬂow is backwards with respect to
the wavevector. Physically, this diﬀerence can be ex-
plained by looking at the transverse structure of these
two modes. In Figs. 3 (a,b) we plot the proﬁles of the two
modes having the same frequency k = ω/c = 0.85cm−1,
with diﬀerent longitudinal wavenumber β . Correspond-
ing points are shown in the inset in Fig. 2. For the mode
(a), the energy ﬂow in the metamaterial exceeds that in
the periodic structure (slow decay of the ﬁeld for z < −ds
and fast decay into the periodic structure), thus the to-
tal energy ﬂow is backward. For the mode (b) we have
the opposite case, and the mode is forward. In the right-

handed Tamm state geometry, the energy ﬂow in all parts
of the wave are directed along the wavenumber and the
localized surface waves are always forward. To demon-
strate this, in Fig. 4 we plot the total energy ﬂow in the
modes as a function of the wavenumber β. These re-
sults conﬁrm our discussion based on the analysis of the
dispersion characteristics.

Increasing the thickness of the cap layer dc will push
the dispersion of both right- and left-handed modes inside
the gap (see the curves for dc = 0.65cm in Fig. 2), thus
providing better localization of the modes. In the second
gap, for the chosen parameters the LHM mode exists
deeper in the gap than the right-handed mode, allowing
for a better wave localization. An example of the second-
gap-mode proﬁle is shown in Fig. 3(d). One can see that
the second band modes are generally weaker localized at
the interface then the modes from the ﬁrst band gap.

Finally, in Fig 5 we plot the existence regions for the
surface Tamm modes on the parameter plane (dc, β).
Shaded is the area where the surface modes do not ex-
ist. Increasing the cap layer thickness, dc, we eﬀectively

in Fig. 3(c). The contours of the corresponding non-

existence regions for right-handed Tamm states are also
shown in Fig. 5. The regions have qualitatively diﬀer-
ent shapes. While the lower non-existence region moves
down with increase of β preserving its width, the corre-
sponding right-handed region shifts upwards, decreasing
signiﬁcantly in width.

In conclusion, we have studied novel types of electro-
magnetic surface waves guided by an interface between
a left-handed metamaterial and a one-dimensional pho-
tonic crystal. We have shown that in the presence of
a left-handed material the surface Tamm waves can be
either forward or backward while for conventional struc-
tures the Tamm states are always forward. We have com-
pared the properties of the backward Tamm states with
the case of conventional dielectric structures and ana-
lyzed the existence regions for both right- and left-handed
Tamm states. We believe our results will be useful for a
deeper understanding of the properties of surface waves
in plasmonic and metamaterial systems.

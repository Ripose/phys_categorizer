Abstract

The ABCD matrix is one of the essential mathematical instruments in optics.
It is the two-by-two representation of the group Sp(2), which is applicable to
many branches of physics, including squeezed states of light, special relativity
and coupled oscillators. It is pointed out that the shear representation is ori-
ented to binary logic which may be friendly to computer applications. While
this is a future possibility, it is known that para-axial lens optics is based on
the shear representation of the Sp(2) group. It is pointed out that the most
general form of the ABCD matrix can be written in terms of six shear ma-
trices, which correspond to lens and translation matrices. The parameter for
each shear matrix is computed in terms of the three independent parameters
of the ABCD matrix.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent series of papers [1,2], Han et al. studied possible optical devices capable of

performing the matrix operations of the following types:

T = (cid:18) 1 a

1(cid:19) ,

0

L = (cid:18) 1 0

1(cid:19) .

b

(1)

Since these matrices perform shear transformations in a two-dimensional space [3], we shall
call them “shear” matrices.

However, Han et al. were interested in computer applications of these shear matrices
Indeed, the T matrix has the

property:

T1T2 = (cid:18) 1 a1

1 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 1 a1 + a2

(cid:19) ,

(2)

and the L matrix has a similar “slide-rule” property. This property is valid only if we restrict
computations to the T -type matrices or to the L-type matrices.

What happens if we use both L and T types? Then it will lead to a binary logic. In the

present paper, we study this binary property of the ABCD matrix, which takes the form

G = (cid:18) A B

C D(cid:19) ,

(3)

where the elements A, B, C and D are real numbers satisfying AD − BC = 1. Because of
this condition, there are three independent parameters.
We are interested in constructing the most general form of the ABCD matrix in terms of
the two shear matrices given in Eq.(1). Two-by-two matrices with the above property form
the symplectic group Sp(2). Indeed, we are quite familiar with the conventional representa-
tion of the two-by-two representation of the Sp(2) group. This group is like (isomorphic to)
SU(1, 1) which is the basic scientiﬁc language for squeezed states of light [4]. This group
is also applicable to other branches of optics, including polarization optics, interferometers,
layer optics [5], and para-axial optics [6,7]. The Sp(2) symmetry can be found in many other
branches of physics, including canonical transformations [3], special relativity [4], Wigner
functions [4], and coupled harmonic oscillators [8].

Even though this group covers a wide spectrum of physics, the mathematical content
of the present paper is minimal because we are dealing only with three real numbers. We
use group theoretical theorems in order to manage our calculations in a judicious manner.
Speciﬁcally, we use group theory to represent the most general form of the ABCD matrix in
terms of the shear matrices given in Eq.(1), and to translate the group theoretical language
into a computer friendly binary logic.

With this point in mind, we propose to write the two-by-two ABCD matrices in the

form

Since each matrix in this chain contains one parameter, there are N parameters for N matrices
in the chain. On the other hand, since both T and L are real unimodular matrices, the ﬁnal

T LT LT . . ..

(4)

expression is also real unimodular. This means that the expression contains only three
independent parameters.

Then we are led the question of whether there is a shortest chain which can accommodate
the most general form of the two-by-two matrices. We shall conclude in this paper that six
matrices are needed for the most general form, with three independent parameters. While
we had in mind possible future computer applications of this binary logic, we are not the
ﬁrst ones to study this problem from the point of view of ray optics.

Indeed, in 1985, Sudarshan et al. raised essentially the same question in connection with
para-axial lens optics [7]. They observed that the lens and translation matrices are in the
form of matrices given in Eq.(1). In fact, the notations L and T for the shear matrices of
Eq.(1) are derived from the words “lens” and “translation” respectively in para-axial lens
optics. Sudarshan et al. conclude that three lenses are needed for the most general form
for the two-by-two matrices for the symplectic group. Of course their lens matrices are
appropriately separated by translation matrices. However, Sudarshan et al. stated that the
calculation of each lens or translation parameter is “tedious” in their paper.

In the present paper, we made this calculation less tedious by using a decomposition of
the ABCD matrix derivable from Bargmann’s paper [9]. As far as the number of lenses
is concerned, we reach the same conclusion as that of Sudarshan et al..
In addition, we
complete the calculation of lens parameter for each lens and the translation parameter for
each translation matrix, in terms of the three independent parameters of the ABCD matrix.
In Sec. II, it is noted that the Sp(2) matrices can be constructed from two diﬀerent sets of
generators. We call one of them squeeze representation, and the other shear representation.
In Sec. III, it is shown that the most general form of the Sp(2) matrices or ABCD matrices
can be decomposed into one symmetric matrix and one orthogonal matrix.
It is shown
that the symmetric matrix can be decomposed into four shear matrices and the orthogonal
matrix into three. In Sec. IV, from the traditional point of view, we are discussing para-axial
lens optics. We shall present a new result in this well-established subject. In Sec. V, we
discuss other areas of optical sciences where the binary representation of the group Sp(2)
may serve useful purposes. We discuss also possible extension of the ABCD matrix to a
complex representation, which will enlarge the group Sp(2) to a larger group.

II. SQUEEZE AND SHEAR REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SP(2) GROUP

Since the ABCD matrix is a representation of the group Sp(2), we borrow mathematical

tools from this group. This group is generated by

1

B1 =

0

2 (cid:18) i
2 (cid:18) 0 −i

0 −i(cid:19) ,
0 (cid:19) ,

i

1

L =

B2 =

1

2 (cid:18) 0

i

i

0(cid:19) ,

(5)

when they are applied to a two-dimensional xy space. The L matrix generates rotations
around the origin while B1, and B2 generate squeezes along the xy axes and along the axes
rotated by 45o respectively. This aspect of Sp(2) is well known. Let us consider a diﬀerent
representation.

3

The shear matrices of Eq.(1) can be written as

s

(cid:18) 1
0 1(cid:19) = exp (−isX1) ,
(cid:18) 1
u 1(cid:19) = exp (−iuX2) ,

0

with

X1 = (cid:18) 0

0 0(cid:19) ,

i

X2 = (cid:18) 0 0

0(cid:19) ,

i

which serve as the generators. If we introduce a third matrix

X3 = (cid:18) i

0

0 −i(cid:19) ,

it generates squeeze transformations:

exp (−iηX3) = (cid:18) eη

0

0

e−η (cid:19) .

The matrices X1, X2, and X3 form the following closed set of commutation relations.

[X1, X2] = iX3,

[X2, X3] = 2iX2.

[X1, X3] = −2iX1,

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

As we noted in Eq.(6), the matrices X1 and X2 generate shear transformations [3,10,11].
The matrix X3 generate squeeze transformations. Thus what is the group generated by one
squeeze and two shear transformations?

The generators of Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) can be written as

X1 = B2 − L, X2 = B2 + L, X3 = 2B1,

(11)

where L, B1 and B2 are given in Eq.(5). The Sp(2) group can now be generated by two
seemingly diﬀerent sets of generators namely the squeeze-rotation generators of Eq.(5) and
the shear-squeeze generators of Eq.(11). We call the representations generated by them the
“squeeze” and “shear” representations respectively. It is quite clear that one representation
can be transformed into the other at the level of generators. Our experience in the conven-
tional squeeze representation tells us that an arbitrary Sp(2) matrix can be decomposed into
squeeze and rotation matrices. Likewise then, we should be able to decompose the arbitrary
matrix into shear and squeeze matrices.

We are quite familiar with Sp(2) matrices generated by the matrices given in Eq.(5). As

shown in Appendix A, the most general form can be written as

G = (cid:18) cos φ − sin φ

cos φ (cid:19)(cid:18) eη

sin φ

0

0

e−η (cid:19)(cid:18) cos λ − sin λ

cos λ (cid:19) ,

sin λ

(12)

where the three free parameters are φ, η and λ. The real numbers A, B, C and D in Eq.(3)
can be written in terms of these three parameters. Conversely, the parameters φ, η and λ

4

can be written in terms of A, B, C and D with the condition that AD − BC = 1. This
matrix is of course written in terms of squeeze and rotation matrices.
Our next question is whether it is possible to write the same matrix in the shear repre-
sentation. In the shear representation, the components should be in the form of T and L
matrices given in Eq.(1) and a squeeze matrix of the form

(cid:18) eη

0

0

e−η (cid:19) ,

(13)

because they are generated by the matrices given in Eq.(7) and Eq.(8). But this mathemat-
ical problem is not our main concern. In the present paper, we are interested in whether it
is possible to decompose the ABCD matrix into shear matrices.

III. DECOMPOSITIONS AND RECOMPOSITIONS

We are interested in this paper to write the most general form of the matrix G of Eq.(3)
as a chain of the shear matrices.
Indeed, Sudarshan et al. attempted this problem in
connection with para-axial lens optics. Their approach is of course correct. They concluded
however that the complete calculation is “tedious” in their paper.

We propose to complete this well-deﬁned calculation by decomposing the matrix G into
one symmetric matrix and one orthogonal matrix. For this purpose, let us write the last
matrix of Eq.(12) as

sin φ

(cid:18) cos φ
− sin φ cos φ(cid:19)(cid:18) cos θ − sin θ
cos θ (cid:19) ,

sin θ

(14)

with λ = θ − φ. Instead of λ, θ becomes an independent parameter.
onal:

The matrix G can now be written as two matrices, one symmetric and the other orthog-

with

G = SR,

R = (cid:18) cos θ − sin θ

cos θ (cid:19) .

sin θ

The symmetric matrix S takes the form [2]

S = (cid:18) cosh η + (sinh η) cos(2φ)

(sinh η) sin(2φ)

(sinh η) sin(2φ)

cosh η − (sinh η) cos(2φ)(cid:19) .

(15)

(16)

(17)

Our procedure is to write S and R separately as shear chains. Let us consider ﬁrst the
rotation matrix.

In terms of the shears, the rotation matrix R can be written as [10]:

R = (cid:18) 1 − tan(θ/2)

0

1

(cid:19)(cid:18) 1

sin θ

5

0

1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1 − tan(θ/2)

0

1

(cid:19) .

(18)

This expression is in the form of T LT , but it can also be written in the form of LT L. If we
take the transpose and change the sign of θ, R becomes
(cid:19)(cid:18)

tan(θ/2) 1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1 − sin θ

R′ = (cid:18)

tan(θ/2)

1(cid:19) .

(19)

1

0

0

0

Both R and R′ are the same matrix but are decomposed in diﬀerent ways.

As for the two-parameter symmetric matrix of Eq.(17), we start with a symmetric LT LT

form

S = (cid:18) 1 0

1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1 a

1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1

a 1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1

0

0

0

b

b

1(cid:19) ,

which can be combined into one symmetric matrix:

S = (cid:18)

1 + a2

b(1 + a2) + a 1 + 2ab + b2(1 + a2)(cid:19) .

b(1 + a2) + a

(20)

(21)

By comparing Eq.(17) and Eq.(21), we can compute the parameters a and b in terms of η
and φ. The result is

a = ±q(cosh η − 1) + (sinh η) cos(2φ),

b =

(sinh η) sin(2φ) ∓ q(cosh η − 1) + (sinh η) cos(2φ)

cosh η + (sinh η) cos(2φ)

.

This matrix can also be written in a T LT L form:

S′ = (cid:18) 1

0

b′

1 (cid:19)(cid:18) 1

a′

0

1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1 a′

1 (cid:19)(cid:18) 1

b′

0

0

1(cid:19) .

(22)

(23)

Then the parameters a′ and b′ are

a′ = ±q(cosh η − 1) − (sinh η) cos(2φ),

b′ =

(sinh η) sin(2φ) ∓ q(cosh η − 1) − (sinh η) cos(2φ)

cosh η − (sinh η) cos(2φ)

.

(24)

The diﬀerence between the two sets of parameters ab and a′b′ is the sign of the parameter
η. This sign change means that the squeeze operation is in the direction perpendicular to
the original direction. In choosing ab or a′b′, we will also have to take care of the sign of
the quantity inside the square root to be positive. If cos(2φ) is suﬃciently small, both sets
are acceptable. On the other hand, if the absolute value of (sinh η) cos(2φ) is greater than
(cosh η − 1), only one of the sets, ab or a′b′, is valid.
so doing, we can reduce the number of matrices by one

We can now combine the S and R matrices in order to construct the ABCD matrix. In

SR = (cid:18) 1

We can also combine making the product S′R′. The result is

(26)

For the combination SR of Eq.(25), two adjoining T matrices were combined into one T
matrix. Similarly, two L matrices were combined into one for the S′R′ combination of
Eq.(26).

In both cases, there are six matrices, consisting of three T and three L matrices. This
is indeed, the minimum number of shear matrices needed for the most general form for the
ABCD matrix with three independent parameters.

IV. PARA-AXIAL LENS OPTICS

So far, we have been investigating the possibilities of representing the ABCD matrices
in terms of the two shear matrices.
It is an interesting proposition because this binary
representation could lead to a computer algorithm for computing the ABCD matrix in
optics as well as in other areas of physics. Indeed, this ABCD matrix has a deep root in
ray optics [6].

In para-axial lens optics, the lens and translation matrices take the form

L = (cid:18) 1
−1/f

0

1(cid:19) ,

T = (cid:18) 1

0 1(cid:19) ,

s

(27)

respectively. Indeed, in the Introduction, this was what we had in mind when we deﬁned
the shear matrices of L and T types. These matrices are applicable to the two-dimensional
space of

(cid:18) y
m(cid:19) ,

(28)

where y measures the height of the ray, while m is the slope of the ray.

The one-lens system consists of a T LT chain. The two-lens system can be written as
T LT LT . If we add more lenses, the chain becomes longer. However, the net result is one
ABCD matrix with three independent parameters. In Sec. III, we asked the question of
how many L and T matrices are needed to represent the most general form of the ABCD
matrix. Our conclusion was that six matrices, with three lens matrices, are needed. The
chain can be either LT LT LT or T LT LT L. In either case, three lenses are required. This
conclusion was obtained earlier by Sudarshan et al.
in 1985 [7]. In this paper, using the
decomposition technique derived from the Bargman decomposition, we were able to compute
the parameter of each shear matrix in terms of the three parameters of the ABCD matrix.
In para-axial optics, we often encounter special forms of the ABCD matrix. For instance,
the matrix of the form of Eq.(13) is for pure magniﬁcation [12]. This is a special case of the
decomposition given for S and S′ in Eq.(21) and Eq.(23) respectively, with φ = 0. However,

7

if η is positive, the set a′b′ is not acceptable because the quantity in the square root in
Eq.(24) becomes negative. For the ab set,

a = ± (eη − 1)1/2 ,

b = ∓e−η (eη − 1)1/2 .

The decomposition of the LT LT type is given in Eq.(20).

We often encounter the triangular matrices of the form [13]

(cid:18) A B
0 D(cid:19) or (cid:18) A 0

C D (cid:19) .

(29)

(30)

However, from the condition that their determinant be one, these matrices take the form

(cid:18) eη B

e−η (cid:19) or (cid:18) eη

C e−η (cid:19) .

0

0

(31)

The ﬁrst and second matrices are used for focal and telescope conditions respectively. We
call them the matrices of B and C types respectively. The question then is how many shear
matrices are needed to represent the most general form of these matrices. The triangular
matrix of Eq.(30) is discussed frequently in the literature [12,13]. In the present paper, we
are interested in using only shear matrices as elements of decomposition.
Let us consider the B type. It can be constructed either in the form

(cid:18) eη

0

or

0

e−η (cid:19)(cid:18) 1 e−ηB
1 (cid:19)

0

(cid:18) 1 eηB

1 (cid:19)(cid:18) eη

0

0

0

e−η (cid:19) .

(32)

(33)

The number of matrices in the chain can be either four or ﬁve. We can reach a similar
conclusion for the matrix of the C type.

V. OTHER AREAS OF OPTICAL SCIENCES

We write the ABCD matrix for the ray transfer matrix [12]. There are many ray transfers
in optics other than para-axial lens optics. For instance, a laser resonator with spherical
mirrors is exactly like para-axial lens optics if the radius of the mirror is suﬃciently large [14].
If wave fronts with phase is taken into account, or for Gaussian beams, the elements of the
ABCD matrix becomes complex [15,16]. In this case, the matrix operation can sometimes
be written as

w′ =

Aw + B
Cw + D

,

(34)

where w is a complex number with two real parameters. This is precisely the bilinear
representation of the six-parameter Lorentz group [9]. This bilinear representation was
discussed in detail for polarization optics by Han et al. [17]. This form of representation is
useful also in laser mode-locking and optical pulse transmission [16].

8

The bilinear form of Eq.(34) is equivalent to the matrix transformation [17]

(cid:18) v′

1
v′

2 (cid:19) = (cid:18) A B

C D(cid:19)(cid:18) v1

v2 (cid:19) ,

with

w =

v2
v1

(35)

(36)

This bilinear representation deals only with the ratio of the second component to the ﬁrst in
the column vector to which ABCD matrix is applicable. In polarization optics, for instance,
v1 and v2 correspond to the two orthogonal elements of polarization.

Indeed, this six-parameter group can accommodate a wide spectrum of optics and other
sciences. Recently, the two-by-two Jones matrix and four-by-four Mueller matrix have been
shown to be two-by-two and four-by-four representations of the Lorentz group [1]. Also re-
cently, Monz´on and S´anchez showed that multilayer optics could serve as an analog computer
for special relativity [5]. More recently, two-beam interferometers can also be formulated in
terms of the Lorentz group [18].

CONCLUDING REMARKS

The Lorentz group was introduced to physics as a mathematical device to deal with
Lorentz transformations in special relativity. However, this group is becoming the major
language in optical sciences. With the appearance of squeezed states as two-photon coherent
states [19], the Lorentz group was recognized as the theoretical backbone of coherent states
as well as generalized coherent states [4].
In their recent paper [2], Han et al.

studied in detail possible optical devices which
produce the shear matrices of Eq.(1). This eﬀect is due to the mathematical identity called
“Iwasawa decomposition” [20,21], and this mathematical technique is relatively new in op-
tics. The shear matrices of Eq.(1) are products of Iwasawa decompositions. Since we are
using those matrices to produce the most general form of ABCD, we are performing inverse
processes of the Iwasawa decomposition.

It should be noted that the decomposition we used in this paper has a speciﬁc purpose.
If purposes are diﬀerent, diﬀerent forms of decomposition may be employed. For instance,
decomposition of the ABCD matrix into shear, squeeze, and rotation matrix could serve
useful purposes for canonical operator representations [13,22]. The amount of calculation
seems to depend on the choice of decomposition.

Group theory in the past was understood as an abstract mathematics. In this paper, we
have seen that it can be used as a calculational tool. We have also noted that there is a
place in computer science for group theoretical tools.

APPENDIX A: BARGMANN DECOMPOSITION

In his 1947 paper [9], Bargmann considered

W = (cid:18) α

β∗ α∗ (cid:19) ,

β

(A1)

with αα∗ − ββ∗ = 1. There are three independent parameters. Bargmann then observed
that α and β can be written as

α = (cosh η)e−i(φ+λ),

β = (sinh η)e−i(φ−λ).

Then W can be decomposed into

W = (cid:18) e−iφ

0

eiφ (cid:19)(cid:18) cosh η

cosh η (cid:19)(cid:18) e−iλ

eiλ (cid:19) .

(A2)

(A3)

In order to transform the above expression into the decomposition of Eq.(12), we take the
conjugate of each of the matrices with

C1 =

Then C1W C −1

leads to

We can then take another conjugate with

C2 =

1(cid:19) .

Then the conjugate C2C1W C −1

e−η (cid:19)(cid:18) cos λ − sin λ

sin λ

This expression is the same as the decomposition given in Eq.(12).

The combined eﬀect of C2C1 is

C2C1 =

1

√2 (cid:18) eiπ/4
−e−iπ/4

eiπ/4
e−iπ/4 (cid:19) .

(A4)

(A5)

(A6)

(A7)

(A8)

If we take the conjugate of the matrix W of Eq.(A1) using the above matrix, the elements
of the ABCD matrix become

A = α + α∗ + β + β∗,
B = −i(α − α∗ + β − β∗),
C = −i(α − α∗ − β + β∗),
D = α + α∗ − β − β∗.

10

(A9)

It is from this expression that all the elements in the ABCD matrix are real numbers.
Indeed, the representation αβ is equivalent to the ABCD representation. In terms of the
parameters λ, η and φ,

A = (cosh η) cos(φ + λ) + (sinh η) cos(φ − λ),
B = (cosh η) sin(φ + λ) + (sinh η) sin(φ − λ),
C = (cosh η) sin(φ + λ) − (sinh η) sin(φ − λ),
D = (cosh η) cos(φ + λ) − (sinh η) cos(φ − λ).

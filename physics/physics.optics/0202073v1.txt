Numerical Aperture of
Single-Mode Photonic Crystal Fibers

Niels Asger Mortensen, Jacob Riis Jensen, Peter M. W. Skovgaard, and Jes Broeng

Abstract— We consider the problem of radiation into free
space from the end-facet of a single-mode photonic crystal
ﬁber (PCF). We calculate the numerical aperture NA = sin θ
from the half-divergence angle θ ∼ tan−1(λ/πw) with πw2 be-
ing the eﬀective area of the mode in the PCF. For the ﬁber
ﬁrst presented by Knight et al. we ﬁnd a numerical aperture
NA ∼ 0.07 which compares to standard ﬁber technology. We
also study the eﬀect of diﬀerent hole sizes and demonstrate
that the PCF technology provides a large freedom for NA-
engineering. Comparing to experiments we ﬁnd good agree-
ment.

I. Introduction

PHOTONIC CRYSTAL FIBERS (PCF) constitute a

completely new class of optical ﬁbers consisting of pure
silica with air-holes distributed in the cladding. Among
many remarkable properties [1] PCFs are believed to have
a potential for high-numerical aperture (NA) applications.
Here we report a calculation of the NA for the class of PCFs
ﬁrst fabricated by Knight et al. [2], [3]. For this particular
ﬁber we ﬁnd a numerical aperture up to NA
0.07. We
also demonstrate how the NA may be controlled by the
hole size for a given pitch and wavelength.

where Aeﬀ = πw2 is the eﬀective area. For w

deviations whereas nice agreement is found for w > λ. We
then turn to the application of the PCF of Knight et al.
[2] which belongs to the latter regime with w > λ. Finally,
we compare our calculations to experiments.

II. Numerical aperture in the Gaussian

approximation

The numerical aperture NA = sin θ (see Fig. 1) may
be deﬁned in various ways, but often one deﬁnes it in the
far-ﬁeld limit (z
) from the half-divergence angle θν
between the z-axis and the ν-intensity point rν (z), i.e.

The paper is organized as follows: First we consider the
problem of radiation into free space from the end-facet of a
single-mode optical ﬁber with a mode approximated by a
Gaussian of width w. Solving the scattering problem at the
end-facet of the ﬁber exactly we check the range of validity

which is often the one used experimentally. Eqs. (3,4) are
valid for kw
1, but in order to check the validity in
the limit with kw of order unity we solve the scattering
problem at the end-facet of the ﬁber exactly. In the ﬁber
(z < 0) the ﬁeld is of the form

where the transverse ﬁeld is approximated by a Gaussian

which has an eﬀective area Aeﬀ = πw2 at frequency ω. At
the end-facet of the ﬁber (z = 0) the ﬁeld couples to the
free-space solution

In order to solve the elastic scattering problem, ∆ω =
ω(β)
ω(k) = 0, we apply appropriate boundary conditions
at the end-facet of the ﬁber; continuity of Ψ and ∂Ψ/∂z. At
z = 0 we thus get two equations determining the reﬂection
amplitude R and the transmission amplitude T . Elimi-
nating R and substituting the resulting T into Eq. (7) we
get

Here, χ = k⊥/k, J0 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind
of order 0, and neﬀ = β/k is the eﬀective mode-index.
Eq. (8) is the exact solution to the scattering problem and
in contrast to many approximate text-book expressions (see
e.g. Refs. [4]) we have here treated the scattering problem
correctly including the small, but ﬁnite, backscattering in
the ﬁber. Thus, we take into account the possible ﬁltering
in transmitted k⊥ at the ﬁber end-facet. The solution has
similarities with the Hankel transform usually employed
in the far-ﬁeld inversion integral technique, see e.g.
[5].
Numerically we have found that Eq. (8) gives a close-to-
Gaussian ﬁeld in the far-ﬁeld limit.

In Fig. 2 we compare the two approximate solutions
Eqs. (3,4) to a numerically exact calculation of tan θν from
Eq. (8). The calculation is performed for the realistic sit-
uation with neﬀ = β/k = 1.444 corresponding to a silica-
1 the deviations increase because
based ﬁber. For kw
of the small, but ﬁnite, backscattering at the end-facet of
the ﬁber. For kw somewhat larger than unity a very nice
agreement is found. A typical all-silica ﬁber like the Corn-
ing SMF28 has kw > 10.

III. Application to photonic crystal fibers

We consider the class ﬁrst studied in Ref. [2] which con-
sists of pure silica with a cladding with air-holes of diameter
d arranged in a triangular lattice with pitch Λ. For a review
of the operation of this class of PCFs we refer to Ref. [6].
In applying Eq. (3) to PCFs we calculate w from the

eﬀective area Aeﬀ = πw2 given by [7]

Indeed we ﬁnd that the corresponding Gaussian of width
w accounts well for the overall spatial dependence of the
ﬁeld. Of course we thereby neglect the satellite spots seen
in the far-ﬁeld [2], but because of their low intensity they
only give a minor contribution to the NA [8].

For the ﬁeld H of the PCF, fully-vectorial eigenmodes
of Maxwell’s equations with periodic boundary conditions
are computed in a planewave basis [9].

[2] of
this kind had a pitch of Λ = 2.3 µm and was found to
be single-mode in the range Λ/λ between 1.5 and 6.8. In
Fig. 4 we show the corresponding half-divergence angle. We
have also shown the value of the dimensionless parameter
kw (dashed line, right axis); the magnitude justiﬁes the
application of the approximate result in Eq. (3) to PCFs.
We note that for non-linear PCFs [10] the value of kw will
approach the regime where deviations from Eq. (3) arise.
In Fig. 5 we show the half-divergence angle for diﬀerent
hole sizes where the ﬁber is endlessly single mode [11]. For
small hole sizes d/Λ we note that in practice the operation
is limited by a signiﬁcant conﬁnement loss for long wave-

this can be seen as a bending-down of θ for small Λ/λ. In
general the NA increases for increasing hole size and ﬁxed
pitch and wavelength. By adjusting the pitch Λ and the
hole size d this demonstrates a high freedom in designing
a ﬁber with a certain NA at a speciﬁed wavelength.

0.53 and Λ

In order to verify our calculations experimentally a PCF
with d/Λ
7.2 µm has been fabricated. In
Fig. 6 we compare our calculations to a measurement of the
NA at the wavelength λ = 632 nm. As seen the calculation
agrees well with the measured value.

IV. Conclusion

We have studied the numerical aperture (NA) of pho-
tonic crystal ﬁbers (PCF). The calculations is based on the
tan−1(λ/πw) which we
approximate “standard” result θ
have found to be valid in the regime relevant to PCFs. As
an example we have applied it to the ﬁber ﬁrst fabricated
by Knight et al. [2]. By studying the eﬀect of diﬀerent hole
sizes we have demonstrated that the PCF technology have
a strong potential for NA-engineering in the single-mode
regime.

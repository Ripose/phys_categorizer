Optical microcavities conﬁne light spatially and temporally and ﬁnd application in a wide range
of fundamental and applied studies. In many areas, the microcavity ﬁgure of merit is not only deter-
mined by photon lifetime (or the equivalent quality-factor, Q), but also by simultaneous achievement
of small mode volume V . Here we demonstrate ultra-high Q-factor small mode volume toroid mi-
−3. These values are the
crocavities on-a-chip, which exhibit a Q/V factor of more than 106(λ/n)
highest reported to date for any chip-based microcavity. A corresponding Purcell factor in excess
of 200 000 and a cavity ﬁnesse of 2.8 × 106 is achieved, demonstrating that toroid microcavities are
promising candidates for studies of the Purcell eﬀect, cavity QED or biochemical sensing

Microcavities can be characterized by two ﬁgures of
the temporal conﬁnement is described by the
merits:
quality factor of the mode Q , and the spatial conﬁne-
ment is characterized by the mode volume V.[1] Of all op-
tical microcavities, whispering-gallery-type microsphere
resonators have obtained the highest Q factor to date
(nearly 9 billion[2][3]). While Q-factor ﬁgures promi-
nently in many applications, minimizing mode volume
is also important in a variety of fundamental and applied
studies such as quantum information studies, photonics
and biochemical sensing. In particular, a high Q/V ratio
is desirable in applications such as lasers, add-drop ﬁlters
and biochemical sensors, which rely upon a large ﬁnesse.
Cavities can also be used to enhance the spontaneous
emission rate, a concept which is used in “single-photon
on-demand” sources,[4][5] where the ﬁgure of merit is the
Purcell factor, given by

(Ref.

[6]). Wafer-based cavities such as photonic
crystals[7] microposts,[4] or microdisks[8] typically have
much smaller mode volume than microspheres, and allow
wafer-scale integration and control. However, the Q fac-
tor of these cavities has remained signiﬁcantly lower than
for silica microspheres. However, recently, ultra-high-
Q performance on a chip has been demonstrated using
a toroid-microcavity.[9] These cavities allow integration
and control previously not accessible in the ultra-high-Q
regime. Here we demonstrate that toroid microcavities
not only allow one to obtain ultrahigh- Q, but also to
achieve small mode volumes, reaching a previously inac-
cessible range of Q/V ratio of more than 106(λ/n)−3. By
variations of the principal and minor toroid diameter, the
Q/V value was adjusted and the highest achieved value
wasQ/Vm = 2.5 × 106(λ/n)−3 (for a toroid microcavity
with λ = 1550 nm, Vm = 180 µm3, and Q0 = 4 × 108).
This result is more than one order of magnitude larger
than the highest value reported so far, using crystal de-
fect cavities.[7][10] Further optimization of the toroid mi-
crocavity can result in yet higher values. The use of silica
microtoroids allows the preservation of ultra-high-Q fac-
tors while the additional transverse spatial conﬁnement

of the optical mode over spherical cavities results in a
smaller modal volume. To investigate the modal volumes
of toroid microcavities achievable experimentally, sam-
ples were fabricated as described in Ref. [9], by lithogra-
phy and etching followed by a CO2 laser-assisted reﬂow-
process. Figure 1 shows a scanning electron microscopy
image of a toroid microcavity. The geometrical parame-
ters de-ﬁning the structure are the minor toroid diame-
ter d and theprincipal toroid diameter (denoted D). The
principal toroid diameter D was controlled by the size of
the initial silica disk preform. The thickness of the toroid
(i.e., minor diameter d) is determined by a combination
of the initial oxide thickness and the ﬂux and exposure
time of the subsequent CO2 laser anneal.
In order to
create small mode volume microcavities, 1 µm thermally
oxidized silicon wafers were used. Subsequently, pho-
tolithography and etching were used to create various
diameter silica disk preforms, with the smallest diame-
ter being 20 µm. The laser assisted reﬂow was used in
a ﬁnal step to create toroidal microcavities. Duringthis
process the silica melts, and the toroid principal diameter
is reduced while silica is consumed to form the toroidal
peariphery. For a 1-µm-thick thermal oxide, the smallest
toroidal cross sections (minor) diameters obtained in this
work were 3.3 µm and principal diameters as small as 12
µm were achieved, as inferred by scanning-electron mi-
croscopy. It should be noted that for oxide layers below
1 µm, it was found that the residual strain in the oxide
caused nonuniform silica disk preforms.

Characterization of the quality factor of microtoroid-
sproceeded by coupling the optical whispering-gallery
modes to tapered optical ﬁbers. A piezoelectric three-
axis stage with 20 nm closed-loop resolution allowed ac-
curate control of the taper-microtoroid coupling gap. Ta-
pers with diameters of 1 − 2µm were used, and eﬃcient
coupling with high ideality was achieved.[11]A narrow
line-width external cavity laser was used to excite the
optical modes, and the taper transmission recorded. The
ultra-high-Q toroid modes typically exhibited a doublet
structure due to the presence of scattering centers which
can induce modal coupling of the degenerate clockwise
and counterclockwise whispering-gallery modes.[? ][12]

can be described by the dimensionless modal coupling pa-
rameter Γ ≡ τ0
γ ,[12] and was found to generally increase
for decreasing microcavity size, due to the enhanced
scattering-capture eﬃciency of the WGM modes. The
inset of Fig. 2 shows the doublet structure of a WGM in
a 28-µm-diameter toroid (with the doublet splitting fre-
quency γ−1/2π = 15.5M Hz, and Γ = 31). In addition,
the optical modes exhibited strong thermal eﬀects even
at low powers, due to their small mode volume. These
thermal eﬀects induce distortion of the line-shape unless
input power levels are adjusted to a suitably low value.
These distortions tend to make the apparent linewidth
larger (pull the resonant frequencies of the mode) in
one frequency scan direction while making its appear-
ance narrower in the opposing scan direction. These ar-
tifacts present a challengeto Q measurement based upon
linewidth measurement alone.
In order to accurately
determine the Q in presence of strong modal coupling
and thermal eﬀects, an alternative approach was used.
This approach does not rely upon measurement of cav-
ity linewidth, but on measurement of doublet splitting
frequency γ−1/2π and the cavity ringdown time at the
critical coupling point. Alternatively, the cavity Q can be
inferred by measurement of the modal coupling parame-
ter and a ringdown measurement, as is presented in Ref.
[9]. In comparison with the latter, the method presented
here does not require knowledge of Γ ,[12] but rather
only the doublet splitting frequency γ−1/2π. Measure-
ment of splitting frequency is less sensitive to thermal
eﬀects since the splitting frequency has been observed
to be nearly immune to thermal shifts (assuming that
each mode is frequency shifted nearly equally by the ex-
citation wave). Therefore, the splitting frequency can be
deduced even in a regime where the individual doublets
are thermally distorted. To infer the quality factor, the
measurement of the splitting frequency is combinedas in

Figure 2 shows the quality factor determined through
this method for a number of microtoroids as a function
of toroid principal diameter D for minor diameter in the
range of d= 2.8 − 6 µm . The highest measured value
was 4 108, in a toroid microcavity with geometrical pa-
rameters d = 6 µm, D = 29 µm, and λ = 1550 nm.
As evident from the experimental results, ultra-high-Q
(>108) factor could be maintained until a limiting diam-
eter of 28 µm, below which point a strong decrease of
Q factor is observed. Reduction of Q for smaller prin-
cipal diameters is expected, as the whispering-gallery
loss increases as a result of the increased optical leak-
age through the whispering-gallery potential.[13][14] In a
sphere the whispering-gallery Q scales as Q ∝ exp(2l),
where l is the angular mode number.[13][14]. Numer-
ical modeling conﬁrms that the angular mode number
for the measured microtoroids is nearly unchanged com-
pared to that of a microsphere of identical principal diam-
eter, and the radial eigenfunctions are still well described

by their microsphere counterparts. Therefore, the Q-
factor is expected to approximately scale according to
the whispering-gallery loss of a microsphere. For compar-
ison, the numerically calculated whispering-gallery-loss
for a microsphere TE(TM) mode is also shown in Fig. 2
and track the measured Q toroid Q values in the leaky
regime. Also evident from Fig. 2, the toroid microcavi-
ties of this work nonetheless show Q-values typically more
than l order of magnitude below the expected whispering-
gallery-loss limit for a spherical cavity, indicating that
other contributing factors such as surface scattering and
surface contaminant absorption also increase with de-
creasing diameter. This is consistent with observations
in silica microspheres.[2] To infer the mode volume of the
fundamental whispering-gallery modes of the microcavi-
ties, we used a numerical ﬁnite-element modeling method
in conjunction with the exact toroid geometry (as deter-
mined from scanning-electron microscopy) to solve for
the optical modes of the toroid. Mode volume can then
be evaluated from the commonly used deﬁnition (where
is the dielectric constant ǫ):

The inset of Fig. 3 shows the mode volume of the
fundamental TE whispering-gallery modes, as a function
of minor toroid diameter d (for a principal diameter of
25, 50,and 75 µm). As expected, the mode volume is con-
tinuously reduced as a function of both decreasing princi-
pal diameter D and minor diameter d . For a ﬁxed princi-
pal diameter D, reduction of minor diameter causes ﬁrst
1/4
a slow reduction of mode volume [scaling as (d/D)
,
due to azimuthal compression of the mode], followed by
a strong compression of the modein both radial and az-
imuthal directions. Figure 3 shows the Q/V ratio deter-
mined for the samples under consideration in this study.
The Q/V value exhibits an optimum, which occurs near
a principal diameter of 29 µm. At large principal diam-
eters the intrinsic quality factor is experimentally found
to be nearly independent of radius (believed to be lim-
ited byscattering and OH absorption contributions) and
for this reason reduction of the principal cavity diame-
ter allows an increase in Q/V ratio. However, the Q/V
value cannot be increased indeﬁnitely, as the reduction of
mode volume ultimately comes at the expense of reduced
quality factor due to the presence of tunneling loss. For
radii where the tunnel loss becomes the dominant loss
mechanism, the reduction in mode volume is more than
oﬀset by a much more strongly reduced quality factor,
adversely aﬀecting the Q/V value. Therefore, for a given
minor diameter
, an optimum Q/V value exists. More
generally, since the mode volume (and Q) depends on
both minor and outer toroid diameter, there is also an
absolute maximum of the Q/V value for toroid micro-
cavities. Numerical modeling of the maximum achievable

The maximum achievable Q/V factor in these stud-
ies was 2.5 × 106 (λ/n)
, for a microtoroid with D =
29µm, d = 6µm, Q = 4 × 108, Vm = 180 µm3 at λ = 1550
nm. The highest reported Q/V factor to date for an
optical microcavity is 4.5 · 104 (λ/n)
, for a photonic
crystal defect cavity.[7] Therefore, the measured value
in this work constitutes a more than one order of mag-
nitude improvement, and enters an unprecedented Q/V
range of more than 106 (λ/n)
. To allow further com-
parison with other microcavity geometries, the Purcell
factor and ﬁnesse are also calculated. The cavity-ﬁnesse
2.8 = 106 exceeds the highest value reported so far of
2.3 = 106.[15] In addition a Purcell-factor of 2 · 105 is
achieved, which is an improvement of more than one or-
der of magnitude over previously reported values[7][10].
In summary, ultra-high-Q small mode volume toroid
microcavities are demonstrated. By reduction of the
toroidal cross section and variation of the cavity princi-
pal diameteran optimum ratio of quality factor to mode
volume Q/V was obtained. The mode volume reduc-
tion was calculatedusing numerical modeling of the toroid
modes. The highest achieved Q/V value was in excess
of 106 (λ/n)
and is more than one order of magni-
tude larger than for any other chip based microcavity.
Corresponding Purcell factor and cavity ﬁnesse are also
record values for in this device. The large Purcell-factor
shows that toroid microcavities are promising candidates
for achieving enhancement of spontaneous emission, and
related studies.

Spatially Correlated Sources

Abstract

We consider the eﬀect of spatial correlations on sources of polarized electromagnetic radiation. The
sources, assumed to be monochromatic, are constructed out of dipoles aligned along a line such that their
orientation is correlated with their position. In one representative example, the dipole orientations are
prescribed by a generalized form of the standard von Mises distribution for angular variables such that
the azimuthal angle of dipoles is correlated with their position. In another example the tip of the dipole
vector traces a helix around the symmetry axis of the source, thereby modelling the DNA molecule. We
study the polarization properties of the radiation emitted from such sources in the radiation zone. For
certain ranges of the parameters we ﬁnd a rather striking angular dependence of polarization. This may
ﬁnd useful applications in certain biological systems as well as in astrophysical sources.

Introduction

In a series of interesting papers Wolf and collaborators [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] studied the spectrum of light from
a spatially correlated sources and found, remarkably, that in general the spectrum does not remain invariant
under propagation even through vacuum. In the present paper we investigate Polarization properties of a
correlated dipole array. Just as we expect spectral shifts for spatially correlated non-monochromatic sources,
we expect nontrivial polarization eﬀects if the correlated source emits polarized light.

A simple model of such a source can be constructed by arranging a series of dipoles along a line with
their orientations correlated with the position of the source. The dipoles will be taken to be aligned along
z2/2σ2]. The orientation of the dipole is characterized by the
the z axis and distributed as a gaussian exp[
polar coordinates θp, φp, which are also assumed to be correlated with the position z. A simple correlated
ansatz is given by

−

exp [α cos(θp) + βz sin(φp)]
N1(α)N2(βz)

(1)

where α and β are parameters, N1(α) = πI0(α) and N2(βz) = 2πI0(βz) are normalization factors and I0 is
the Bessel function. The basic distribution function exp(α cos(θ
θ0)) used in the above ansatz is the well
known von Mises distribution which for circular data is in many ways the analoque of Gaussian distribution
for linear data [8, 9, 10]. For α > 0 this function peaks at θ = θ0. Making a Taylor expansion close to its peak
θ0. The maximum likelihood estimators for the mean
we ﬁnd a gaussian distribution to leading power in θ
angle θ0 and the width parameter α are given by, < sin(θ
θ0) >= d log(I0(α))/dα
respectively. In prescribing the ansatz given in Eq. 1 we have assumed that the polar angle θp of the dipole
orientation is uncorrelated with z and the distribution is peaked either at θp = 0 (π) for α > 0 (< 0).
The azimuthal angle φp is correlated with z such that for β > 0 and z > 0(< 0) the distribution peaks at
φp = π/2(3π/2).

We next calculate the electric ﬁeld at very large distance from such a correlated source. The observation
point Q is located at the position (R, θ, φ) (Fig 1) measured in terms of the spherical polar coordinates and
we assume that the spatial extent of the source σ << R. The electric ﬁeld from such a correlated source at

where ˆp is a unit vector parallel to the dipole axis, p0 is the strength of the dipole, ω is the frequency of
light and I0 denotes the Bessel function. Since we are interested in the radiation zone we have dropped all
terms higher order in z/R. The resulting ﬁeld is ofcourse transverse i.e. ~E
ˆR = 0. We have also assumed
that all the dipoles radiate at same frequency and are in phase. The correlation of the source with position
is measured by the parameter β.

·

It is convenient to deﬁne scaled variable z = z/σ, λ = λ/σ where λ = 2πω/c is the wavelength, and
β = βσ. The integrations over θp and φp can be performed analytically. We numerically integrate over
z for various values of position of the observation point, the parameter α which determines the width of
the distribution of θp and for diﬀerent value of the correlation parameter β. The observed polarization is
computed by calculating the coherency matrix, given by

The state of polarization can be uniquely speciﬁed by the Stokes’s parameters or equivalently the Poincare
sphere variables [11]. The Stoke’s parameters and the Poincare sphere variables are obtained in terms of the
coherency matrix as:

The parameter S0 is proportional to the intensity of the beam. The Poincare sphere is charted by the angular
variables 2χ, and 2ψ, which can be expressed as:

2 Results and Discussion

We ﬁrst study the situation where β > 0 and α > 0. The result for several values of (θ, φ) are given in
ﬁgures 2,3 which show plots of the Poincare sphere variables 2χ and 2ψ. The scaled wavelength λ = λ/σ of
the emitted radiation is taken to be equal to π, i.e. the eﬀective size of the source σ is of the order of the
wavelength λ. The results show several interesting aspects. The ellipticity of the state of polarization shows
signiﬁcant dependence on the position of the observer. The angle χ = 0, i.e. the beam is purely linearly
polarized, for the polar angle cos(θ) = 0, 1 for all values of azimuthal angle φ. It deviates signiﬁcantly from
0 as cos(θ) varies from 0 to 1. For sin(φ) = 0, 2χ = π/2 at some critical value θt as cos(θ) varies between
0 and π/2, i.e. the state of polarization is purely right circular at θ = θt. For sin(φ) > 0, 2χ also deviates
signiﬁcantly from 0 and displays a peak at some value of θ. The precise position of the peak is determined
by the values of the correlation parameters α and β.

The alignment of linear polarization also shows some very interesting aspects. For sin(φ) = 0, we ﬁnd
that ψ is either 0 or π depending on the value of θ. The transition occurs at the same critical value of θ
where the angle χ shows a peak. The state of polarization is purely linear with the electric ﬁeld along the ˆθ
for cos(θ) = 0 and then acquires a circular component for increasing values of cos(θ). At the transition point
θ = θt, the polarization is purely circular. With further increase in value of θ the state of polarization is
elliptical with the linearly polarized component aligned along ˆφ. The transition point is clearly determined
by the condition S1 = J11 −
For other values of sin(φ) we ﬁnd ψ = 0 for cos θ = 0 and then deviates signiﬁcantly from 0 as θ
approached θt, ﬁnally levelling oﬀ as cos θ approches 1. The ﬁnal value of ψ at cos θ = 1 depends on the
correlation parameters and sin φ but for a wide range of parameters 2ψ > π/2. Hence the linear polarizations
from sources of this type shows striking characteristic, i.e. that the polarization angle ψ is either 0 or close
to π/2 depending on the angle at which it is viewed.

J22 = 0.

For sin φ < 0 the Poincare sphere polar angle 2χ is same as for sin φ > 0, however the orientation of the
linear polarization 2ψ lies between π and 2π, i.e. in the third and fourth quadrants of the equatorial plane
on the Poincare sphere. For a particular value of φ the azimuthal angle ψ(φ) =

φ).

ψ(

If we change the sign of α we do not ﬁnd any change in linear polarization angle ψ however the value of
χ changes sign, i.e. the state of polarization changes from right elliptical to left elliptical. Change in sign of
β also leaves ψ unchanged while changing the sign of χ. Changing the signs of both α and β produces no
change at all.

−

−

In the case of the limiting situation where β = 0 we ﬁnd, as expected, linear polarization is independent
of the angular position, i.e. χ = 0 and ψ = 0. This is true for any value of the parameter α, which determines
the polar distribution of the dipole orientations. Hence we see that the eﬀect disappears if either the eﬀective
.
size of the source σ = 0 or the correlation parameter β = 0. The eﬀect also dissappears in the limit α
→ ∞
In this limit the distribution of θp is simply a delta function peaked at 0 and hence our model reduces to a
series of dipoles aligned along the z-axis, which cannot give rise to any nontrivial structure. In the numerical
calculations above we have taken the eﬀective size of the source σ of the order of the wavelength λ. If the
size σ << λ, the eﬀect is again negligible since the phase factor ωz ˆR
ˆz/c in Eq. 2 is much smaller than one
in this case.

·

Hence we ﬁnd that in order to obtain a nontrivial angular dependence of the state of polarization the
size of the source, assumed to be coherent, has to be of the order of or larger than the wavelength as well as
the correlation length 1/β.

2.1 Transition angle

From our results we see that there exists a critical value of the polar angle θ at which the state of linear
polarization changes very rapidly. This is particularly true if we set sin φ = 0 where we ﬁnd that that the
orientation of linear polarization ψ suddenly jumps from 0 (or π) to π/2 at some critical value of the polar
angle θ = θt. We study this case in a little more detail. The θ and φ components of the total electric ﬁeld
is given by,

the polarization angle 2ψ jumps from 0 to π is determined by the condition S1 = 0. This is clearly also the

This can be used to determine θt as a function of α, β. The result for cos θt as a function of α is plotted
in ﬁgure 4 for several diﬀerent values of β. For any ﬁxed value of the parameter β, the transition angle θt
decreases from π/2 to 0 as α goes from zero to inﬁnity. This is expected since as α becomes large the polar
angle distribution of the dipole orientations, peaked along the z axis, becomes very narrow and hence the
resultant electric ﬁeld is aligned along the z axis for a large range of polar angle θ. Furthermore we ﬁnd, as
expected, that as β goes to zero the transition angle also tends towards 0.

2.2 Two Dipole Model

Further insight into the behavior of such sources can be gained by considering a model consisting of two
z respectively and are oriented such that their polar angles
dipoles ~p1 and ~p2 which are located at z and
θ1 = θ2 = θp and the azimuthal angles φ1 =
φ2 = π/2. We will assume that θp lies between 0 and π/2.
The strength of the dipoles is p0 and they radiate at frequency ω. The electric ﬁeld at any point is then
an addition of two vectors ˆp1 ·
ˆp2 with phase diﬀerence of 2ωz cos θ/c. The vector
ˆp at any point (R, θ, φ) is ofcourse simply the projection of the polarization vector ˆp on the plane

Several of the features seen in the model prescribed by Eq. 1 can be veriﬁed analytically in this case. First
of all we notice that as z
0 and the entire eﬀect disappears. The same is true for θp = 0 or π/2
i.e. if both the dipoles are aligned along a single axis. At sin φ = 0, θ = π/2 the wave is linearly polarized
(χ = 0) with ψ = 0. As θ decreases from π/2 to 0, χ > 0 and the wave has general elliptical polarization.

0, S2, S3 →

At a certain value of the polar angle θ = θt the wave is purely right circularly polarized. As θ crosses θt,
the linearly polarized component jumps from 0 to π/2, i.e. 2ψ changes from 0 to π. The value of the polar
angle θt at which the transition occurs is determined by

tan(ωz cos θt/c) =

sin θt/ tan θp

±

From this equation we see that as z

0, θt is close to zero for a wide range of values of θp. Only when
π/2, a solution with θt signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0 can be found. In general, however, we can ﬁnd a

θp →
solution with any value of θt by appropriately adjusting z and θp.

We can also analytically verify the results for diﬀerent cases discussed in the previous model. For example,
φ, S2 changes sign while the remaining Stokes parameters remain unchanged. This implies that 2χ
as φ
remains unchanged while ψ

example while keeping β ﬁxed. In this situation, i.e. α < 0, the distribution of polar angle θp peaks at π
instead of 0. In the present example this is equivalent to θp →

2.3 Helical Model

−

We next study an interesting generalization of the model discussed above. Instead of the having the peak
of the φp distribution ﬁxed to
π/2 for z < 0 and π/2 for z > 0 we allow it to rotate in a helix circling
ξz)]. As z goes from negative
around the z-axis. In this case we replace the φp dependence by exp[β(φp −
to positive values, the peak of the distribution rotates clockwise around the z-axis forming an helix. This is
a reasonable model of the structure of DNA molecule and hence has direct physical application. We study
this in detail by ﬁxing the azimuthal angle of the dipole orientation φp = ξz and the polar angle θp to some
constant value, i.e. the φp and θp distributions are both assumed to be delta functions. This allows us to
perform the z integration in Eq. 1 analytically. The resulting state of polarization, described by Poincare
sphere angles 2χ and 2ψ are shown in Figs. 5-8 . In this model we can extract a simple rule to determine
the transition angle for the special case θp = π/2 and ξ = nπ where n is an integer. We set sin φ = 0 for
this calculation since it is only for this value that the polarization becomes purely circular for some value of
θ = θt and the linearly polarized component ﬂips by π/2 at this point. A straightforward calculation shows
that this transition angle θt is given by:

cos2 θt = nλ/2

Here n represents the number of π radians that are traversed by the tip of electric ﬁeld vector along the
helical path and λ is the wavelength. In order to get at least one transition λ < 2/n. In the special case
under consideration there is atmost one transition. However in general the situation is more complicated
and for certain values of θp and ξ, more than one transitions are possible. Some representative examples are
shown in Figs. 5-8.

3 Conclusions

In this paper we have considered spatially correlated monochromatic sources. We ﬁnd that at large distance
the polarization of the wave shows dramatic dependence on the angular position of the observer. For certain
set of parameters the linearly polarized component shows a sudden jump by π/2.
If the symmetry axis
of the source is taken to be the z-axis, the polarization shows a sudden transition from being parallel
to perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the source, as the polar angle is changed from π/2 to 0. The
sources considered in this paper are idealized since we have assumed coherence over the entire source.
For small enough sources, such as the DNA molecule, this may a reasonable approximation. In the case of
macroscopic sources, this assumption is in general not applicable. However in certain situations some aspects
of the behavior described in this paper may survive even for these cases. For example, we may consider a
macroscopic source consisting of large number of structures of the type considered in this paper. As long as
there is some correlation between the orientation of these structures over large distances we expect that some
aspects of the angular dependence of the polarization of the small structures will survive, even if there does

5

not exist any coherent phase relationship over large distances. Hence the ideas discussed in this paper may
also ﬁnd interesting applications to macroscopic and astrophysical sources. As an interesting example we
consider astrophysical sources of radio waves. It is well known that the polarization angle of these sources is
predominantly observed to be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the source orientation axis [12]. This
diﬀerence has generally been attributed to the existence of diﬀerent physical mechanism for the generation of
radio waves in these sources. Our study, however, indicates that this diﬀerence in observed polarization angle
could also arise simply due to diﬀerent angles of observation. Hence orientation eﬀects must be considered
before attributing diﬀerent physical mechanisms for diﬀerences in observed polarizations of these sources.

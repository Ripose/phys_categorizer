Abstract

The diﬀraction problem of a plane wave impinging on a grating formed by nested cavities is

solved by means of the modal method, for s and p polarization modes. The cavities are formed

by perfectly conducting sheets that describe rectangular proﬁles. The electromagnetic response

of the grating is analyzed, paying particular attention to the generation of resonances within

the structure. The dependence of the resonances on the geometrical parameters of the grating

is studied, and results of far and near ﬁeld are shown. The results are checked and compared

with those available in the literature for certain limit cases.

Introduction

Current radio detection and ranging (RADAR) technologies employ highly concentrated beams

of electromagnetic energy to scan an area. The return echo is then processed to detect all

targets of interest [1]. To prevent this kind of detection, a target can either deﬂect the beam in

a direction away from the observer, absorb the energy of the incoming beam or alter the return

echo by changing its frequency or shape. Giving an aircraft textured skin that could interact

with an incoming beam adaptively would allow most shapes to be metamorphic to radar. Recent

research based on sub-wavelength, narrow-band, resonant, corrugated, high impedance surfaces

have shown promising results in this area [2, 3]. However, the speed, bandwidth and adaptability

of these surfaces are limited. To avoid the narrow-band resonant behavior, lumped structures

can be replaced by broadband antenna arrays that add a controlled phase delay to the reﬂected

signal allowing beam steering away from the observer [4]. Fractal planar antennas [5]-[7] exhibit

multi-band behavior and are small in electrical size, but their scattering behavior is not widely

understood. Nested multilayer corrugated surfaces constitute an interesting alternative for this

purpose. If successful, unwanted radiation due to ﬁnite ground planes can be minimized and

the inter elemental coupling can be reduced, thus obtaining the desired eﬀect. The study of the

electromagnetic response of the two-layer periodic structure proposed in this paper is expected

to provide a ﬁrst approach to the behavior of multilayer surfaces and their advantages as part

of broadband antennas.

The resonant behavior of inﬁnitely periodic gratings of rectangular proﬁle was studied by many

authors, in particular for s polarization [8]-[13]. The excitation of surface shape resonances in

structures comprising cavities have been lately studied for particular proﬁles of the corrugation.

The resonant features of an isolated cavity or groove of univalued and multivalued geometries

have been investigated by means of diﬀerent implementations of two basic approaches: the

integral and the modal methods [14]-[21]. The results show that a strong intensiﬁcation inside

the cavity is found for certain wavelengths when its proﬁle is bivalued, such as a slotted cylinder

or a bottle-shaped groove [18]-[20]. The eﬀect produced by the surface shape resonances on the

response of an array of cavities has also been studied [21]-[23].

The modal method employed here to solve the diﬀraction problem from an inﬁnite grating

comprising rectangular grooves and bottle-shaped cavities, was ﬁrst formulated to deal with

2

simple geometries such as rectangular [9], triangular [24] or semicircular [25]. Later it was

generalized for arbitrary shapes of the grooves [26, 27], and recently it was also applied to

bottle-shaped cavities [21]. The implementation of the modal method for perfectly conducting

structures results in a simple and eﬃcient way of calculating the external and the internal ﬁelds,

without the need of any sophisticated algorithm.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the electromagnetic response of a two-layer perfectly-

conducting grating comprising grooves and cavities. Particular attention is paid to the resonant

behavior of this structure and its eﬀect in the ﬁeld distribution inside and far from the corruga-

tions. The study of such gratings constitutes a ﬁrst approach to the analysis of N-layer fractal

gratings, which are expected to be useful for the control of the phase delay in the scattering

response of broadband microwave antennas.

In Sec. 2 we pose the problem and give the details of the modal method applied to the present

structure, for both fundamental polarization modes. In Sec. 3 we give numerical results for the

reﬂected eﬃciency as well as for the near ﬁeld. We analyze the dependence of the resonances

on the geometrical parameters of the structure, and compare the results obtained in limit cases

with those found in the literature. Finally, some conclusions are summarized in Sec. 4.

2 Theoretical formulation

We consider the diﬀraction of a plane wave by a two-layer nested grating. The structure is

one-dimensional and inﬁnitely periodic, and each period is formed by a bottle-shaped cavity

and rectangular grooves, bounded by perfectly conducting sheets (see Fig. 1).

The wavelength of the incoming wave is λ and the angle of incidence is θ0. Since the structure

and the ﬁelds are invariant under traslations in the ˆz direction, the problem can be separated into

two scalar problems corresponding to the basic modes of polarization: s (electric ﬁeld parallel to

the rulings) and p (magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the rulings). In the upper layer, the period has two

rectangular grooves of width a11 and height h1 (zones 11 and 13, see Fig. 1), and a central neck

of the same depth but of width a12 (zone 12). The second layer is a rectangular cavity which

occupies the whole period, i.e., its width is d and its depth is h2 (zone 21). The surrounding

medium is vacuum. In what follows, both polarizations will be treated simoultaneously, denoting

by f the z-component of the electric ﬁeld in the s-case and that of the magnetic ﬁeld in the

p-case.

In an homogeneous medium, the rectangular geometry of the structure allows a separable solu-

tion of Helmholtz equation in cartesian coordinates. The modal method consists in expanding

the ﬁelds inside the corrugations in their own eigenfunctions (modes) that satisfy by themselves

the boundary conditions at the sides of the cavities. In the homogeneous region (y ≥ 0), the

total ﬁeld f is given by:

To solve the problem, the ﬁelds in each zone are matched imposing the boundary conditions at

the horizontal interfaces y = −h1 and y = 0. Then, expression (4) with (8) and (12) is matched

at y = −h1 with the ﬁeld in the central neck of the ﬁrst layer (zone 12), given by (4) with (6)

and (10). For 0 ≤ x ≤ a11 and a11 + a12 ≤ x ≤ d, a null tangential electric ﬁeld is required. At

y = 0, the ﬁelds in zones 11, 12 and 13 are matched with those in y ≥ 0, given by eq. (1). All

these conditions generate four x-dependent equations, that are projected in appropriate bases

(either the modal functions or the plane waves) to give an inﬁnite system of linear equations for

the unknown amplitudes, for each polarization case. The explicit expressions of these equations

can be found in the Appendix. To ﬁnd the numerical solution to this problem, we truncate

the modal series in (4) and the plane wave expansions in (1), and get a matrix system which is

solved by a standard numerical technique of inversion.

3 Numerical results

In this section we analyze the diﬀraction by nested gratings for s and p polarization, paying

particular attention to the surface shape resonances that characterize their electromagnetic

response. All the results presented have been checked to satisfy energy conservation within an

error less than 10−11. The results for limit cases such as a comb grating (h2 → 0) [28] and

a bottle-shaped grating (h1 → 0) [21] have also been veriﬁed. Even though the method was

developed for an arbitrary angle of incidence, in all the results presented we consider normal

incidence. We analyze the grating response as a function of the depth of the bottom cavities

h2/d and of the width of the neck a12/d (Figs. 2-6) and show the dependence of the behaviour

of these structures as a function of the incident wavelength (Figs. 7-8).

In Fig. 2 we plot the specular eﬃciency versus h2/d for s polarization, where: h1/d = 0.1,

λ/d = 0.65 and a12/d = 0.2 (solid) and 0.4 (dashed). It can be noticed that there are minima

in the eﬃciency curves for certain values of h2. These minima are sharper and deeper for the

narrower neck of the cavities, and can be associated with surface shape resonances.

(14)

Notice that the ﬁrst value of m in (14) is 1 for s- polarization (the x- dependent part of the

p

electric ﬁeld modes is a pure sine function, and m = 0 would imply null ﬁeld), whereas it is 0 for

p-polarization (the x- dependent part of the magnetic ﬁeld modes is a pure cosine function, and

here m = 0 implies uniform distribution in the x direction), as it is explicitly shown in eq. (8).

Besides, due to the symmetry imposed by the normally incident plane wave, only odd values of

m are allowed for s-polarization, and only even values of m for p-polarization. The number of

decimal places kept in the tables was determined by the resolution necessary to deﬁne correctly

each minimum in the eﬃciency curve. The sharper dips require more decimals than the smooth

ones.

The resonant depths of the nested grating are close to those of the closed waveguide obtained by

eq. (14), even though the present structure is open. The relationship between the width of the

dip, the quality of the resonance and the interior ﬁeld can be better understood by inspection

of the near ﬁeld.

In Figs. 3 and 4 we plot the electric ﬁeld magnitude (relative to the incident ﬁeld) for diﬀerent

resonant depths of the structure considered in Fig. 2. In all the contour plots presented (Figs.

3, 4, 6 and 8) the black represents maximum intensity, and the gray scale is maintained in all

three ﬁgures. Figs. 3a to 3f correspond to the resonant conﬁgurations for a12/d = 0.2, whereas

Figs. 4a and 4b correspond to the 1st and 5th resonant cases for a12/d = 0.4. It can be observed

in Fig. 3, that the contour plots of the inner ﬁeld in the resonant conﬁgurations are similar

to the conﬁgurations expected for the eigenmodes of a rectangular waveguide. Each one of the

ﬁgures can be associated with a certain mn mode of the closed waveguide: Fig. 3a. corresponds

to the 11 mode, Fig. 3b to the 12, Fig. 3c to the 13, Fig. 3d to the 14, Fig. 3e to the 31,

and Fig. 3f to the 15. Besides, the interior ﬁeld is strongly intensiﬁed: the ratio between the

maximum value inside and outside the structure varies between 6 (Fig. 3a) and 35 (Fig. 3e) for

resonant conﬁgurations, whereas out of the resonance the ﬁeld inside and outside the structure

has roughly the same value. Notice that the vertical scale is not maintained in all the ﬁgures,

and therefore the depth of the cavities look equal although each one corresponds to a diﬀerent

depth. When the neck of the cavities is widened, the quality of the resonances becomes lower,

as observed in the dashed curve of Fig. 2. At the same time, the resonant depths shift to lower

values, thus moving further from the predicted depths for the closed waveguide. This behaviour

is expected since this structure is less similar to the closed one.

The contour plots of electric ﬁeld corresponding to this situation are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a

corresponds to the ﬁrst dip (h2/d = 0.23) and Fig. 4b corresponds to the 5th. dip (h2/d =

1.4335). In the ﬁrst case there is no intensiﬁcation: the ﬁeld takes the same values inside and

outside the structure. The second case corresponds to the narrower dip of the dashed curve in

Fig. 2, and consequently to the better resonance for the range of h2 considered. In this case there

is an intensiﬁcation, but it is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of Fig. 3e (for the same resonant

mode but a12/d = 0.2 instead of 0.4, and h2 very close to that of the prevoius case). When the

minimum of specular eﬃciency is better localized, the enhancement of the ﬁeld increases and so

does the quality of the resonance.

0.65, θ0 = 0◦ and s polarization (dashed line in Fig. 2): (a) h2/d = 0.23; (b) h2/d = 1.4335.

The equivalent curve to the solid one in Fig. 2 but for p polarization is shown in Fig. 5. It

can be noticed that the minima are not as deep and sharp as in the s-case, and this fact is

also reﬂected in the near ﬁeld plots of Fig. 6, where we show the magnetic ﬁeld for the ﬁrst

(h2/d = 0.037) and the 7th. (h2/d = 1.29466) minima of Fig. 5.

Not all the minima for the p-case are located close to those of the closed waveguide, listed in

Table 1. This suggests that in general, these minima are not associated with resonances of

the lower cavities in the nested grating, as it can be seen, for instance, in Fig. 6a, where we

observe that the interior ﬁeld is not intensiﬁed. However, there are certain depths that seem to

fulﬁll the conditions for a resonant mode. This is the case of the 7th dip, whose corresponding

magnetic ﬁeld plot is shown in Fig. 6b. According to Table 1, this dip is located very close to

that of the waveguide for the mode 04, and it can be clearly observed in the contour plot that

the ﬁeld distribution is that corresponding to this mode: nearly uniform distribution in the x

direction and four half wavelengths in the y direction. Even though this is the most intense

case, the intensiﬁcation ratio is of about 6, roughly the same value of the less intensiﬁed mode

of s polarization.

We have also analyzed the grating response as a function of the neck width a12, and we have

found that for each conﬁguration there is an optimum width for which the specular eﬃciency

has its minimum (not shown). This value arises from a compromise relationship between the

narrowness of the neck and the necessary size of the aperture that allows the ﬁeld to get into

the cavity.

In Figs. 7-8 we explore the response of the nested structure as a function of the wavelength. The

specular eﬃciency for both polarization modes is shown in Fig. 7, for a grating with h1/d = 0.1,
h2/d = 0.32675, a12/d = 0.2 and θ0 = 0◦. For λ/d greater than one, there is only one diﬀracted

order, and the specular eﬃciency is equal to unity (not shown). For smaller wavelengths, certain

dips start to appear, that become more frequent as λ → 0. It is interesting to notice that there

are certain wavelengths in which the eﬃciency is nearly zero for one polarization, and at the

same time it is maximum for the other. For instance, at λ/d = 0.65 almost all the specularly

reﬂected wave is p-polarized, whereas at λ/d = 0.5, the reﬂected wave is s-polarized. Then,

this structure behaves as a polarizer for certain wavelengths, which can be varied by properly

designing the cavities.

Using eq. (14) to ﬁnd the resonant wavelengths of a given waveguide, we get the values listed

in Table 2, where these values are compared with those corresponding to the dips of the nested

grating with h1/d = 0.1 and a12/d = 0.2. In the range of wavelengths considered, there are

ﬁve dips for s polarization and eight for p polarization. As it can be noticed in the eﬃciency

curve, some of them are sharper than others. This suggests that their corresponding resonances

are also better, in what concerns to the interior ﬁeld intensiﬁcation. This can be conﬁrmed by

inspection of the interior ﬁeld, shown as contour plots in Fig. 8, for p polarization. The ﬁgures

are ordered by increasing resonant wavelength, and it can be observed that in most of the

cases the magnetic ﬁeld distribution is associated with a resonant mode mn of the rectangular

waveguide. For instance, Fig. 8a is the 02 mode, Fig. 8b is the 60 mode, Fig. 8e is the 40 mode,

Fig. 8f is the 21 mode, etc. It is evident that the presence of an aperture in the cavity modiﬁes

the ﬁeld distribution of each mode, but most of them can still be identiﬁed. An interesting

feature found in the wavelength dependence of the response, is the possibility of having modes

with n = 0. These modes are not allowed in s polarization since they imply null interior

ﬁeld; however, in the p-case, these modes represent an uniform distribution of the ﬁeld in the y

direction. This is the case of the modes 20, 40 and 60, shown in Figs. 8h, 8e and 8b, respectively.

In general, the higher intensiﬁcation is found when the resonant wavelengths are closer to those

of the waveguide. Another interesting phenomenon is the splitting of the 41 mode: there are

two neighbour dips close to the resonant wavelength predicted for the waveguide, but neither of

them is too close (see Table 2). Even though the interior ﬁeld conﬁgurations corresponding to

those wavelengths (Figs. 8c and 8d) are diﬀerent, both can be associated with the 41 mode, but

none exhibits a signiﬁcant intensiﬁcation. The same eﬀect appears in s polarization for the 51

mode (the corresponding interior ﬁeld plots are not shown).

θ0 = 0◦, for s (solid) and p (dashed) polarization.

In general, the s-surface shape resonances in partially closed cavities are more signiﬁcant than

the p-ones, and this is in agreement with previous reports on multivalued structures [19, 20].

4 Conclusion

The diﬀraction problem of a nested grating with rectangular cavities was solved for both polar-

ization modes by means of the modal approach. The response of the grating has been analyzed,

paying particular attention to the surface shape resonances. It was found that these resonances

are stronger for s than for p polarization: the drops in the specular eﬃciency are sharper and

deeper, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the cavities is signiﬁcantly intensiﬁed. The resonant

depths and the contour plots of the near ﬁeld corresponding to the ﬁrst modes of the structure

are associated with the eigenmodes of a rectangular waveguide.

This study is a ﬁrst approach to the analysis of the behaviour of nested structures in the presence

of electromagnetic waves. The advantages of using this kind of structures as parts of broadband

antennas is now being analyzed, not only with the perfectly periodic model but also considering

a ﬁnite structure and multilayers.

5 Appendix

By application of the boundary conditions at the horizontal interfaces, we get four x-dependent

equations that after appropiate projections generate an inﬁnite system of linear equations for the

unknown amplitudes. After a little manipulation of the equations, and making the corresponding

truncations, we can summarize the system for each polarization mode as follows.

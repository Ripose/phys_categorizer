We construct a semiclassical theory for propagation of an optical wavepacket in non-conducting
media with periodic structures of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability,
i.e., non-
conducting photonic crystals. We employ a quantum-mechanical formalism in order to clarify its
link to those of electronic systems. It involves the geometrical phase, i.e., Berry phase, in a nat-
ural way, and describes an interplay between orbital motion and the internal rotation. Based on
the above theory, we discuss the geometrical aspects of the optical Hall eﬀect. We also consider
a reduction of the theory to a system without periodic structure and apply it to the transverse
shift at an interface reﬂection/refraction. For generic incident beams with elliptic polarizations, an
identical result for the transverse shift of each reﬂected/transmitted beam is given by the following
diﬀerent approaches; (i) analytic evaluation of wavepacket dynamics, (ii) total angular momentum
(TAM) conservation for individual photons, and (iii) numerical simulation of wavepacket dynamics.
It is consistent with a result by classical electrodynamics. This means that the TAM conservation
for individual photons is already taken into account in wave optics, i.e, classical electrodynamics.
Finally, we show an application of our theory to a two-dimensional photonic crystal, and propose
an optimal design for the enhancement of the optical Hall eﬀect in photonic crystals.

INTRODUCTION

In particular,

The geometrical phase known as the Berry phase [1]
has been attracting extensive interests in various ﬁelds,
e.g., optics, molecular physics, nuclear physics, and con-
densed matter physics [2, 3].
in con-
densed matter physics, important roles of the geomet-
rical phase in electronic transport phenomena have been
intensively studied in the past several years, and great
strides has been made both in theoretical and experi-
mental researches. Although a hint of the Berry phase
was recognized long time ago as the anomalous velocity
in ferromagnets which leads to the anomalous Hall ef-
fect [4, 5], it was only after the discovery of the quantum
Hall eﬀect that the role of the Berry phase in electron
transport began to be recognized. In the quantum Hall
system under strong magnetic ﬁeld, the Hall conductance
was related to the topological integer, i.e., Chern num-
ber. [6–8]. A recent development is the ﬁnding that the
Berry phase structure is a fundamental characteristic of
the Bloch wavefunctions even in ordinary systems. From
this viewpoint, the similarity between the anomalous and
quantum Hall eﬀects has been revealed [9–11]. The spin
Hall eﬀect based on the geometrical mechanism are also
proposed recently and opened a new stage of spintron-
ics [12, 13]. All of these eﬀects are understood from the
concept of the generalized anomalous velocity due to the

Berry phase. In other words, a trajectory of an electron
is aﬀected by the Berry phase.

In optics, one can also ﬁnd some phenomena related to
the Berry phase. A change of polarization of light dur-
ing propagation such as in helically wound optical ﬁbers
found in the early days [14–16] has been related with the
Berry phase [17–19]. It’s inﬂuence on the trajectory of
light has been studied recently by deriving a set of semi-
classical equations of motion [20]. From this viewpoint,
there are several optical phenomena which are now inter-
preted as a change of light trajectory due to the Berry
phase. One is a transverse shift in reﬂection/refraction
at an interface between two homogeneous media [21–28],
(This eﬀect in the case of internal total reﬂection is called
as Imbert-Fedorov shift.) The other is a rotation of the
beam inside an optical ﬁber, which is sometimes called
as an optical Magnus eﬀect [29, 30]. These phenomena
can be coined as optical Hall eﬀect, because of the sim-
ilarity to the topological Hall eﬀects [6–13] in electronic
systems.

Attribution of these optical phenomena to the Berry
phase is not merely a re-interpretation, but also can open
a new frontier for novel phenomena. The present authors
[20] proposed that in photonic crystals the optical Hall
eﬀect is enhanced by an order of magnitude than the
above-mentioned examples. It is inspired by its electronic
counterpart; the Hall eﬀects are known to be enhanced
by the periodic potential of the lattice, particularly when
two bands come close in energy. Thus by designing the
photonic crystal to have near-degenerate bands, the pre-
dicted shift of the light beam is large enough to be ob-
servable in experiments [20]. To calculate and design
such photonic crystals in a quantitative way, a semi-

classical Berry-phase theory of optics in such photonic
crystals is called for. For this purpose, the approach
by the variational principle [32–35], which we take in
our previous [20] and present papers, works better than
other approaches [30, 31]; it is because the approaches
in Refs. [30, 31] use an eikonal approximation, by which
it is rather diﬃcult to fully incorporate the vectorial na-
ture of the electromagnetic waves for generic cases like
photonic crystals.

In the previous work [20], we have brieﬂy reported the
essence of the optical Hall eﬀect and the mechanism of
its enhancement in artiﬁcial crystals called photonic crys-
tals, i.e., systems with periodic structures of dielectric
permittivity/magnetic permeability [36]. In the present
paper, we construct a semiclassical theory of an opti-
cal wavepacket (or a photon wavepacket) in full detail
by keeping its close connection to a theory of an elec-
tron wavepacket. It incorporates the Berry phase in a
natural way. The main focus of the present paper is to
present basics to the extended geometrical optics appli-
cable to photonic crystals. This class of artiﬁcial crystals
are attracting great interests as new optical materials.
Photonic crystals can be designed to have a desired band
structure, with an aid of ﬁrst-principle numerical calcula-
tions, which enables the control of many novel properties
of lights [36, 37]. To serve for such purposes, our theory is
presented in a transparent way suitable for such numer-
ical calculations. As is brieﬂy presented in our previous
work [20], the eﬀect of the geometrical phase on an optical
wavepacket can be incorporated in the same manner as
that in electronic systems. These generalized equations
of motion correctly describe the interplay between the or-
bital motion and the internal rotation, e.g., polarization,
of wavepackets. The eﬀect similar to the electrical Hall
eﬀects in condensed matter is derived in photonic sys-
tems with periodic structures. Indeed, the semiclassical
equations of motion for the electron wavepacket in solids
were derived in [34, 35], which are analogous to that in
the present paper. However, they basically considered
the spinless electron, and in the case of optics, the polar-
ization degrees of freedom has to be taken into account,
where the Berry connection is non-Abelian in general. In
this sense, the optical wavepacket is more similar to the
spinful electrons.

Below, for simplicity, we focus on the light propagating
in non-conducting media in which there is neither electric
nor magnetic order, i.e., the dielectric permittivity and
the magnetic permeability are symmetric tensors. Also
their frequency dependences are neglected for simplic-
ity. These conditions ensure the equation of continuity
of electromagnetic energy [38] and we can construct the
unitary theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld. Based on this
theory, the semiclassical equations of motion can be de-
rived on an equal footing with electronic systems in which
the semiclassical equations are derived from the quan-
tum mechanics. In order to stress the analogy between
electronic and photonic systems, we formulate a theory
for Bloch states of electromagnetic ﬁeld in a quantum-

2

mechanical formalism. Although we focus on the unitary
theory in this paper, its extension to a non-unitary ver-
sion for systems with electric/magnetic order and con-
ducting systems would give some insights to the inter-
esting proposals, e.g. the photonic Hall eﬀect due to ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld [39], the one-way waveguide of edge
states in magnetic photonic crystals [40], and Lorentz
force on the light due to the toroidal moment [41].

The reduction to a system without periodic structure
is straightforward. Indeed, in the previous work [20], we
have presented a simple application of our theory to the
transverse shift in the reﬂection/refraction at an inter-
face, and found that this shift is governed by the conser-
vation of total angular momentum (TAM) for reﬂected
and refracted photons individually. We have also nu-
merically demonstrated the validity of our theory for the
case of an incident wavepacket with circular polarization.
However very recently, the transverse shift evaluated by
the conservation of TAM has been questioned [42] for the
cases of incident wavepackets with elliptic polarizations.
In this paper, we present an additional way of estimat-
ing the transverse shift from the asymptotic form of the
wavepacket, and also the numerical calculations for the
generic polarized states. As an important consequence
from the study of this issue, we ﬁnd that an identical
result for the shift of each beam is given by (i) analytic
evaluation of wavepacket dynamics, (ii) TAM conserva-
tion for individual photons in Ref. [20] and (iii) numer-
ically exact simulation of wavepacket dynamics. This
agreement in diﬀerent approaches supports the validity
of the present theory claiming that the transverse shift
is governed by the conservation of TAM for individual
photons. These results are also consistent with the more
conventional approach based on classical electrodynam-
ics [26, 27]. In other words, the TAM conservation for
individual photons is already taken into account in wave
optics, i.e., classical electrodynamics.

For a broad readership, we divide the main contents
into two sections; Sec. II is devoted to formalisms, ex-
plaining in full details the derivations of the theory and
the resulting formulae, while in Sec. III we focus on two
applications of the theory: the transverse shift in inter-
face reﬂection/refraction, and the two-dimensional pho-
tonic crystals. Readers who are mainly interested in the
applications can skip Sec. II and jump to Sec. III. For
this purpose we make Sec. III to be self-consistent.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II A, the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in non-conducting media is quan-
tized in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism by introducing
the Dirac bracket for constrained systems. Some quan-
tum operators for physical observables are also presented.
Eigen states in a periodic system is discussed in Sec.
II B for the application to the photonic crystal. In Sec.
II C, we consider a perturbed modulation superimposed
on a background periodic structure and discuss the cor-
rections for the eigen states and the expectation values
of physical observables for an optical wavepacket. The
equations of motion are derived taking into account the

Berry phase and the perturbed modulation. An appli-
cation of our theory to reﬂection-refraction problem at
a ﬂat interface is discussed in Sec. III A by reducing the
theory to the case without periodic structure. Recently
some criticisms are raised against our approach to this
reﬂection-refraction problem [42]. Remarks on these crit-
icisms are presented in Sec. III B. In Sec. III C, we ap-
ply our theory to a modulated two-dimensional photonic
crystal and present the examples of the Berry curvature
and the internal rotation in a periodic system.

Section IV is devoted to the discussion on the implica-
tions of the present work to wider range of phenomena
in physics. Related previous works are mentioned here.

II. FORMALISMS

A. Electromagnetic ﬁeld in non-conducting media

We consider a non-conducting medium without the
electric nor magnetic orders, and begin with the following
Lagrangian,

∇rφ(r, t)],
(2a)
B(r, t) = µ↔(r)H(r, t) = ∇r
(2b)
We take the unit in which ~ = c = 1 where c is the
speed of light in vacuum. The medium where light
propagates is treated as an insulating material, which
is characterized by the dielectric permittivity ǫ↔(r) and
the magnetic permeability µ↔(r). These are assumed to
be locally symmetric and real-valued tensors, and their
frequency dependences are neglected. As mentioned in
Sec. I, the equation of continuity for the electromagnetic
energy holds under these conditions [38].
It should be
noted that this is the suﬃcient conditions but not the
necessary conditions. The functional derivatives with re-
spect to ∂tA(r, t) and ∂tφ(r, t) determine the canonical
momenta π(r, t) =
D(r, t) for A(r, t) and πφ(r, t) for
φ(r, t), while the latter gives the constraint πφ(r, t) = 0.
Here we introduce the Lagrange multiplier λφ(r, t) for
this constraint, and the Hamiltonian is given by

while P and J are conceptually close to P and J, re-
spectively. This is because P and J are not necessarily
proportional to P and J. Actually, P and J do not
necessarily satisfy the algebra of the momentum and the
angular momentum. In spite of this shortcoming, we fo-
cus on P and J rather than P and J, because P and J
have relatively simple expressions even in periodic sys-
tems as shown in Appendix B. Especially, a part of J
suggests a close relation between the internal rotation
and the Berry curvature in photonic systems, as well as
in the quantum Hall system where internal rotation is
originated by the cyclotron motion [34]. The list of these
operators both in electronic and photonic systems are
given in Table I for comparison.

is the energy eigenvalue of the n-th band, which may be
degenerate. It should be noted that the band index n is
not needed in locally isotropic systems without periodic
structure, but we must keep the index λ to distinguish
diﬀerent polarization states. U E
nλk(r) are
Bloch functions for electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld, re-
spectively. It should be noted that the lattice momentum
k will be restricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone in the rest
of this paper. The eigenfunctions satisfy the Maxwell

C. Equations of motion

In order to see the eﬀect of geometrical phase on the
trajectory of a wavepacket, a driving force is needed [43].
This is because the geometrical eﬀect is given by the vec-
tor product between the driving force and the Berry cur-
vature as we shall see later. In an electronic system, a
driving force is most conventionally produced by the gra-
dient of electric potential. The counterpart in photonic
systems is given by the gradient of ǫ↔(r) or µ↔(r). Of
course, a periodic structure itself gives a gradient. How-
ever, this eﬀect is exactly taken into account by consid-
ering optical Bloch states as shown in Appendix B where
readers can ﬁnd details about the basic features of op-
tical wavepackets in periodic systems. Thus we regard
the deviation from a periodic structure as a driving force
for the Bloch states and treat it perturbatively. Here, the
perturbation is introduced as a modulation superimposed
onto the periodic structure of ǫ↔(r) and µ↔(r) as

ǫ↔−

γ2
ǫ (r) ǫ↔−

µ↔−

γ2
µ(r)µ↔−

1(r),(38)

→

→

where γǫ(r) and γµ(r) are scalar functions, and we call
them “the modulation functions” hereafter. This kind of
modulation does not change the local symmetries of ǫ↔(r)
and µ↔(r), and does not violate the energy conservation.
We summarize the deﬁnitions of Berry connection and
curvature in Table II and the main results obtained here,
i.e., the equations of motion for the optical wavepacket,
in Table III. Appendix C supplements details about the
commutation relations and expectation values of various
operators which are needed to derive the equations of
motion in modulated systems.

Now we derive the equations of motion for the dynam-
Ψ

ics of an optical wavepacket. An exact wavefunction
satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation,

It is natural to consider that the trajectory of the
wavepacket is determined in terms of the eﬀective La-
grangian which is given by replacing
with a varia-
Ψ
|
tional wavepacket,
, characterized only by the cen-
i
ters rc, kc of the position and wavevector, respectively,
and the polarization state [33]. Although
can be
brought closer to
by enlarging the number of vari-
ational parameters, those concerning the details of the
wavepacket are neglected here. This approximation is
justiﬁed when a modulation is weak and slowly varying,
and has been successfully applied to the quantum Hall
system and gives the semiclassical understanding of the
motion of magnetic Bloch states [34, 35, 44].

In general, the modulation may mix the creation and
annihilation operators. Here we consider the situation
in which the modulation is suﬃciently weak and time-
independent, and this mixing is negligible. Therefore,
the approximated wavepacket can be constructed as

Finally, it is noted that the optical Hall eﬀect is orig-
inated by the second term on the right-hand side of
Eq. (53a), which is sometimes called “anomalous veloc-
ity”. The anomalous velocity is the vector product of the
zc) and the driving force ˙kc,
Berry curvature (zc|
i.e., the gradient of a superimposed modulation. There-
fore, both of the driving force and the Berry curvature
are needed for this phenomena. In an electronic system
under a strong magnetic ﬁeld, it is pointed out that the
Berry curvature is closely related to the internal rotation
of an electronic wavepacket [34]. Thus, a similar relation
is also expected in a photonic system. Actually, in Ap-
pendices B and D, we can see the close relation between
the Berry curvature and internal rotation of an optical
wavepacket.

III. APPLICATIONS

A. Transverse shift in reﬂection and refraction

As an application of the theoretical framework devel-
oped in Sec. II, we consider the case with locally isotropic
ǫ(r) and µ(r). In this case, we can write down the equa-
tions of motion (53a)-(53c) in simple forms. For this
purpose, we ﬁrst calculate the gauge ﬁeld Λk and the
Berry curvature Ωk. In a helicity basis, the eigenvectors
)-circular polarizations can
for the right(+)- and left(
be written as

The simplest example of the optical Hall eﬀect is re-
alized as the transverse shift at the interface refraction
and reﬂection. There have been a number of studies on
the shifts within and out of the incident plane at the
total reﬂection. The former is well known as the Goos-
H¨anchen eﬀect [45, 46] and has been explained in terms
of the evanescent wave penetrating into the forbidden re-
gion. The latter one, which is referred to as the Imbert-
Fedorov shift, was interpreted by F. I. Fedorov [21] as an
analog of the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect and was observed ex-
perimentally by C. Imbert using multiple total reﬂections
[22], followed by a number of theoretical approaches [23–
25]. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the shift out
of the incident plane could also occur in partial reﬂection
and refraction [25–27]. However, some of the theoretical
predictions for the amount of shift contradict each other.
One reason is an experimental diﬃculty for a measure-
ment of the tiny shift, as the shift is only a fraction of a
wavelength. It was only recent that the Imbert-Fedorov
shift is measured for a single total reﬂection [28]. Thus

FIG. 1: Transverse shift of light beams in the refraction and
reﬂection at an interface.

In our previous paper [20], we calculated this trans-
verse shift by using the conservation of the z-component
of TAM for individual photons, which follows from the
equations of motion (53a)-(53c) applied to this interface
problem. Bliokh et al.
[42] then questioned the result,
claiming that it does not match their result of the shift
for elliptically polarized Gaussian beams. Here we show
that, in all cases with generic polarizations, an identi-
cal result for the transverse shift of each beam is given
by the following diﬀerent approaches, (i) analytic eval-
uation of wavepacket dynamics, (ii) TAM conservation
for individual photons in Ref. [20], and (iii) numerically
exact simulation of wavepacket dynamics. It agrees with
a result by classical electrodynamics, as presented in Ap-
pendix E. In Sec. III B, we shall resolve the inconsistency
between the identical result by the approaches (i)-(iii)
and that given in Ref. [42]. Thereby the validity of our
theory presented here is completely guaranteed.

Our equations of motion are not directly applicable
to the refraction and reﬂection problem at a sharp in-
terface since they require the slowly varying conditions

Indeed, our equations of mo-

tion do not correctly describe a splitting of an incident
wavepacket into reﬂected and transmitted wavepackets
nor changes of their polarization states at the interface.

However, in a simple case with a ﬂat interface, a simple
extension of our theory works well, as will be explained
in the following. Here, as shown in Fig. 1, we consider
the case where the incident beam comes from the region
with x < 0 and z < 0 along the plane of y = const., and
the interface is the z = 0 plane.

intuitively expected that this phenomena is closely re-

equations of motion lead to the conservation of the z-

symmetry around the z-axis. Actually, from Eq. (63) for
the transverse shift and Eq. (64) for the TAM, we can
reach the conservation of the z-component of the TAM
for each of individual photons

z = jT

(65)

where jI,T,R are the TAM of incident, transmitted and
reﬂected beams, respectively.
It just makes sense that
the incident beam is regarded as a collection of photons;
each photon is reﬂected or transmitted stochastically at
the interface. As we shall see in Sec. III B (and Appendix
E in detail), Eq. (63) for the transverse shift is consistent
with the result derived in classical electrodynamics. In
this sense, this photon picture is implicitly incorporated
already in classical electrodynamics.

Inversely, assuming the conservation of TAM for in-
dividual photons, we can derive the transverse shift as
Eq. (63). This is what we have done in our previous
paper[20]. This derivation of the transverse shift is akin
to the derivation of Snell’s law based on the particle pic-
ture of light in which the refracted and reﬂected angles is
obtained from the conservation of energy and momentum
(parallel to the interface) for individual photons.

In order to verify our theory quantitatively, we check
the property of the transverse shift in more detail. To
obtain (zA

We have conﬁrmed all the above features quanti-

wavepackets. In Ref. [20], we have presented the results
only for the incident beam with right-circular polariza-
tion. Here, to complete the argument, we present the re-
sults of the numerical simulations for more generic cases.

i.e., µ1 = µ2, in these simulations.) The solid and dashed
lines represent the analytic results Eq. (63) for transmit-

and squares are the results of simulations for transmit-

shift for the linearly polarized beam is nonzero only for
a region of total reﬂection, in accordance with our ana-
lytic result. In all cases, the numerical results excellently
agree with Eq. (63), thus verifying our theory. (We have
conﬁrmed this consistency also in cases where both of
permittivity and permeability are diﬀerent in two media

Finally we should comment on our constitution
method of a set of incident, transmitted and reﬂected
wavepackets, which is an exact solution to Maxwell
equations. In each numerical simulation, we have con-
structed an elliptically-polarized incident wavepacket as
a superposition of plane waves with a common polar-
zI) which is independent of k. This
ization state, i.e.,
|
is a natural deﬁnition of incident wavepacket. Oth-
erwise, the concept “an elliptically-polarized incident
wavepacket” gets fuzzy, and the linear composition from
and decomposition to diﬀerent orthonormal bases of in-
cident wavepackets are violated. This is because inci-
dent wavepackets with diﬀerent functions of
’s
for constituent plane waves can have the same mean po-
zI (kI )). Imposing the exact boundary
larization state
|
conditions, transmitted and reﬂected wavepackets are au-
tomatically generated. For partial reﬂection, a single
incident wavepacket split into reﬂected and transmitted
wavepackets after reﬂection/refraction at the interface.
The position of each wavepacket is estimated when each
wavepacket is far from the interface. It should be noted
that the numerical simulations exactly take into account
the changes of shapes of wavepackets, while the analytic
evaluation assumes the sharpness of a weight function for
the superposition.

B. Remarks on other theories

Recently, Bliokh et al. calculated the shift for an ellip-
tic Gaussian incident beam in classical electrodynamics,

and their result disagrees with that obtained from our
theory [42]. They attributed the diﬀerence to a “fallacy”
in our TAM conservation for individual photons. We ex-
plain below in detail that our theory is totally free from
the criticism. To prove this, it is enough to show that
Eq. (63) is equivalent to the transverse shift evaluated
in classical electrodynamics, i.e., the result by Fedoseev
[26, 27]. His procedure of calculation is as follows. First
construct a wavepacket by a linear superposition of plane
waves. By taking into account the exact boundary con-
ditions of electromagnetic ﬁelds (Eqs. (70a) and (70b))
at a ﬂat interface, as in the textbooks of optics or clas-
sical electrodynamics [38, 46], one can construct trans-
mitted and reﬂected wavepackets as an exact solution
to Maxwell equations. The center of each wavepacket is
deﬁned as an average position weighted by each energy
density. The result of this calculation by classical elec-
trodynamics [26, 27] is identical with that by our the-
ory (Eqs. (68) and (69) derived from Eq. (63)) in the
second quantized formalism. The details are presented
in Appendix E. Hence we checked that the following
three approaches give the same transverse shift for each
wavepacket; (i) analytic evaluation of wavepacket dynam-
ics both in classical and quantum-mechanical formalisms,
(ii) TAM conservation for individual photons (Eq. (65)),
(iii) numerically exact simulation of wavepacket dynam-
ics.

There remains an inconsistency between the identical
result obtained by (i)-(iii) and one by Bliokh et al.
in
Ref. [42]. One reason is an inappropriate boundary con-
dition for a set of wavepackets in paraxial approximation.
This boundary condition is diﬀerent from the correct one:

where t is an arbitrary unit vector parallel to the inter-
face, EA and H A (A = I, T, R ) are electric and magnetic
ﬁelds of incident (I), transmitted (T ) and reﬂected (R)
beams, respectively. Another reason for this contradic-
tion comes from the deﬁnition of a center of wavepacket
in Ref. [42]. The methods (i)-(iii) commonly use the
position averaged with a weight of energy density.
In
Ref. [42], on the other hand, the center is deﬁned as a
center of the wavepacket projected onto its mean polar-
ization state. The center of the wavepacket in the for-
mer deﬁnition, i.e. the position averaged by the energy
density, can be easily measured by photon counting, as
employed in two measurements on the Imbert-Fedorov
shift [22, 28], while the latter deﬁnition requires count-
ing of photons projected onto a speciﬁed polarization.
The agreement between totally diﬀerent approaches, i.e.,
(i)-(iii) and classical electrodynamics, suggests that our
deﬁnition is a natural one.

Finally we should comment on the relation between the
conservation laws of TAM in the wave and particle pic-
tures of light. In Ref. [42], it is claimed that, for an inci-
dent beam with an elliptic polarization, the conservation

12

with the conservation of TAM for whole beams,

z = R2jR

However, as we shall show below, Eq. (65) is a suﬃcient
condition for Eq. (71). From Fresnel formulae, we have

and m = zs/zp,
mula represents the conservation of energy ﬂow or equiv-
alently the conservation of the number of photons. One
can easily see that the above formula and Eq. (65) yields
Eq. (71). To summarize, the TAM conservation for indi-
vidual photons (Eq. (65)) has neither contradiction nor
inconsistency with other theories.

C. Two-dimensional photonic crystal

We consider two-dimensional photonic crystals, where
ǫ↔(r) and µ↔(r) are scalar variables ǫ(r) and µ(r) which
are periodically modulated in a xy-plane. Along the z-
direction ǫ(r) and µ(r) are assumed to be uniform. How-
ever, it is noted that in general there may appear ordi-
nary degeneracies at symmetric points and accidental de-
generacies at some speciﬁc points in the Brillouin zone.
Around these points, the semiclassical argument based
on the adiabaticity would not be a good approximation
and it is needed to seriously incorporate the dynamics of
the wavepacket. We restrict ourselves to bands without
degeneracy here for simplicity. In this case, the inversion
symmetry of the periodic structure must be broken in or-
der for a band to have nonzero Berry curvature. This is
because the Fourier transformation of ǫ(r) and µ(r) are
real-valued, when a system has the inversion symmetry.
For a wavepacket constructed from a non-degenerate
band, the equations of motion in Eqs. (53a)-(53c) are
reduced to the following ones,

Ωnkc,

˙rc = ∇kcEnkc;rc + ˙kc ×

In the above equations of motion, the most important
and controllable quantity is the second term on the
right-hand side of Eq. (75a), i.e., the Berry curvature
Ωnkc. The anomalous velocity ˙kc ×
Ωnkc of the optical
wavepacket leads to the optical Hall eﬀect. Compared
with this term, the other correction due to ∆nkc are
small as shown below (see Appendix G also). The pa-
rameter zc becomes a simple complex number and just
represents a phase shift. Thus an optimal design for the
enhancement of the optical Hall eﬀect is equivalent to
the enhancement of the magnitude of the Berry curva-

from an interband eﬀect due to a periodic structure with-
out inversion symmetry, and roughly scales as the inverse
square of a band splitting (see Eqs. (D3a) and (D3b)).
Therefore, we can expect the enhancement of the opti-
cal Hall eﬀect for wavepackets constructed from Bloch
waves around nearly degenerate points in the Brillouin
zone. In two-dimensional photonic crystals, Bloch waves
propagating along the xy-plane (kz = 0) are classiﬁed
into the transverse magnetic (TM) and the transverse
electric (TE) modes. In other words, the Maxwell equa-
tions for the Bloch functions (29a)-(29c) decouple into
two sets of equations, one for the TM and the other for
the TE modes, and the problem of wavepacket dynamics
can be more simpliﬁed. Appendix F gives useful formulae
for the Berry curvature Ωnk and ∆nk in such modes. As
for other modes and more generic case with degenerate
bands, we must use formulae given in Appendix D.

and the second term represents the rotation of the center
of gravity (see Appendices B, D and F). We can clearly
see the correlation between them in each band except
for their relative sign. The relative sign are roughly de-
termined by a factor δE = (ETM(TE) nk
ETM(TE) mk)
at nearly degenerate points k, where n and m represent
band indices of nearly degenerate bands. This is because
the Berry curvature the internal rotation are proportional
to 1/δE2 and 1/δE, respectively (see Appendix F). It
is expected that this internal rotation is closely related
to a physical angular momentum. Therefore, these re-
sults suggest that we can generate photonic modes with
angular momentum by using photonic crystals without
inversion symmetry.

−

Before considering the motion of wavepackets in this
photonic crystal, we should comment on ∆TM nk and
∆TE nk, which give corrections to energy dispersions and
group velocities of TM and TE modes. Because µ = µ0,
i.e., γµ(r) = 1,
it follows from
in the present case,
Eq. (F8a) in Appendix F that ∆TM nk = 0. Thus, when a
modulation is applied only to the dielectric permittivity,
the energy of the TM mode is just rescaled by the factor
ETM nkc;rc = γǫ(rc)ETM nkc. On
γǫ(rc), i.e., ETM nkc →
the other hand, ∆TE nk is nonzero. From Eq. (48), addi-
tional corrections appear in the energy dispersions of TE
modes. However, as shown in Appendix G, we can see
∆TE nk . 0.1a. Thus these corrections are estimated to
be at most a few percent as long as the modulation is suf-
a∇rc ln γǫ(rc)
1. In the similar
ﬁciently weak, i.e.,
|
argument, we can also neglect corrections to the group
velocities of TE modes compared to their anomalous ve-
locities, at least in the present photonic crystal. All the
details of this issue is given in Appendix G.

| ≪

Now we consider the motions of wavepackets con-
structed from TM and TE modes. It is noted that these
wavepackets are extended in z-direction, because the z-
components of their momentum are ﬁxed as kz = 0.
From Fig. 4, we can see that Ωk is strongly enhanced
near the corners of the Brillouin zone. This enhancement
is interpreted as a two-dimensional cut of the monopole
structure in an extended space including parameters [9],
e.g. ξ in the present case. Therefore, we set the initial kc
near the corners of the Brillouin zone in order to make the
eﬀect of anomalous velocity prominent. We superimpose
the following modulation onto the periodic structure,

IV. DISCUSSION

We have presented in detail the derivation of the equa-
tions of motion for an optical wavepacket within the uni-
tary theory. In our formalism, the equations are derived
in the same fashion as those of electronic systems, thereby
the similarities between them are evident. This suggests
a broad concept, i.e., topological Hall eﬀect driven by the
geometrical mechanism, which ranges over a wide area
of physics such as electronic, acoustic, hydrodynamical,
relativistic and photonic phenomena. For example, this
optical Hall eﬀect is referred to as “the optical Magnus
eﬀect” [30, 31], in analogy with the Magnus eﬀect, which
is a transverse aerodynamic eﬀect on rotating objects.
On the other hand, the relation of this eﬀect to the geo-
metrical eﬀect on a spinning particle in general relativity

where ˜n > 0 represents a relative refractive index multi-
plied to the periodic structure in the region x
, and
w is the mean width of the modulation. Here we take
˜n = 1.2 and w = 5a which satisfy the condition of weak
and slowly-varying modulation. The obtained trajecto-
ries are shown in Fig. 5. It is found that the shift of rc
reaches to dozens of times the lattice constant especially
for the wavepacket constructed from the TE second band.
Finally we note that, also in more generic systems than
discussed above, this eﬀect can be enhanced considerably
by designing crystal structures. The Berry curvature
around a nearly degenerate point is determined mostly
by the splitting, 2
, between neighboring bands. Note
that the sign of mg depends on details of wavefunctions
around the nearly degenerate point, while its magnitude

was recently pointed out [48]. They derived the simi-
lar equations of motion to ours by considering the mo-
tion of a spinning particle in the space with the metric
gij(r) = n(r)δij. Their argument reminds us that, in
the early stage of the study on general relativity, Ein-
stein had tried to formulate the theory by generalizing
the speed of light in vacuum. This issue might be related
to the deep question of the dual nature between the force
and the velocity in the dynamics.

As focused in Appendix. D, there is a close relation be-
tween the Berry curvature and the internal rotation. It is
physically expected that an internal rotation can be re-
lated to an internal angular momentum. From this view-
point, the various modes of Laguerre-Gauss beam have
internal orbital angular momentum [49] are of a partic-
ular interest. The Imbert-Fedorov eﬀect is expected for
these modes as well as for circularly polarized states, and
a theoretical investigation on this problem has been done
recently [50–52]. In Sec. III C, we have shown that there
appear photonic modes with internal rotation in peri-
odic structures of dielectric media, i.e., photonic crystals,
without inversion symmetry. Angular momentum corre-
sponding to this kind of internal rotation would be de-
tected by measuring a torque taken by a photonic crystal
when we inject a linearly polarized light into the crystal
(through a buﬀer layer if needed).

Lastly, we make a remark on the relevance of the quan-
tum nature in the topological properties discussed in this
paper. Although we have formulated the theory of an
optical wavepacket in the quantum-mechanical formal-
ism in order to clarify its connection to the theory for
electronic systems, the phenomena itself is based on du-
ality between real-space coordinates and momenta which
is common in wave dynamics. Therefore, the topological
Hall eﬀect is generic in both quantum mechanical and
classical wave dynamics [53]. Actually, we can extend the
argument presented here to other kinds of wavepacket dy-
namics, e.g., dynamics of sonic wavepacket which is men-
tioned in Ref. [30]. It should be noted that the spin of
the constituent particles is not necessarily needed; even a
scalar wave can also have an internal rotation and a Berry
curvature due to a periodic structure breaking inversion
and/or time-reversal symmetries.

APPENDIX B: WAVEPACKETS IN PERIODIC
SYSTEMS

Here we present details about optical wavepackets in
periodic systems. Their basic features are discussed in
Appendix B 1. These features are helpful to understand
the eﬀect of an additional modulation superimposed onto
a periodic structure, which is discussed in Sec. II C. Some
comments on a gauge transformation in momentum space
is given in Appendix. B 2. In Appendix. B 3, we present
detailed procedures to evaluate expectation values which
appears in Appendix B 1.

formalism to light beams with macroscopic number of
photons. However, from the linearity of the Maxwell
equations, the equations of motion for this single pho-
ton wavepacket is applicable also to coherent beams with
macroscopic number of photons.

In fermionic systems, we can deﬁne the position opera-
tor as the center of the probability distribution of the par-
ticles, which is positive-deﬁnite both in non-relativistic
and relativistic systems. However, for relativistic bosons,
the deﬁnition of the position is nontrivial. In order to ﬁnd
an appropriate deﬁnition for the position of wavepacket,
we ﬁrstly consider the energy and the position weighted
by the energy density evaluated as follows,

that the above expectation values are evaluated under the
assumption that the shape of w2

sharp compared to the variations of Enk and Λnk(k)
around kc, and we neglected terms which depend on the

This suggest that the internal rotation correctly includes
the spin of the constituent particle, i.e., the polarization
of light in the present case. However, it should be noted
that the second terms of right-hand side of Eqs. (B7b)
and (B7c) are not the whole contributions of spin. Ac-
tually, when we consider the circularly polarized light in
isotropic homogeneous media, all terms of the internal
rotation give the same contribution and totally represent
the rotation originated by the polarization. In addition,
the internal rotation deﬁned above contains the internal
orbital one and the spin one generally.

2. Gauge transformation

When a system has a symmetry represented by the
unitary matrix [Mnk]λλ′ , Maxwell equations are invariant
under the transformation,

(B9)

where F = E or H. (Here we consider the case in which
there are degeneracies indexed by the subscript λ or λ′.)
For the sake of convenience. we call this transformation
as the gauge transformation in k-space. By this gauge
transformation, Λnk and Ωnk are transformed as

sponding creation operators as

˜a†nλk =

It should be noted that we have changed only the rep-
resentation but not the physical state of wavepacket.
Therefore, the expectation values of physical observables,
e.g., H, R, P and J , must be gauge invariant, while
it is not clear whether their evaluations given in Ap-
pendix. B 1 are also the case. In order to conﬁrm this
point,
it is enough to check whether the position of
wavepacket rc in Eq. (B5) is gauge invariant or not. In
the representation of Eq. (B12), the derivative of phase

it should be noted that the above commutation relation

is constructed from degenerate eigen modes, i.e, eigen
modes with the same band index n. Thus the follow-
ing formula, which will be proved later, is useful to es-
timate the expectation value of J with respect to the

APPENDIX C: EXPECTATION VALUES IN
MODULATED SYSTEMS

When a modulation is introduced into a periodic sys-
tem, the argument given in Appendix B are modiﬁed.
Here we consider the modulation represented by Eq. (38)
which is suﬃciently weak and smooth. It is noted that
the commutation relation Eq. (B18) are not modiﬁed
even under any modulation. From this commutation re-

lation, the creation and annihilation operators of approx-
imated eigen modes satisfy the same commutation rela-
tion as that in periodic systems as shown below. How-
ever, the approximated eigen modes depend on the vari-
able rc. Thus we must additionally take into account the
operator ∇rca†nλk;rc
for the derivation of the eﬀective La-
grangian. Fortunately, we can show that the contribution
from ∇rca†nλk;rc

vanishes by the following relation.

where,
in each commutation relation, we have used
Eqs. (21a) from the ﬁrst to the second expression, and
Eqs. (B20) and (B21) from the second to the third ex-
pression.

Next the expectation values of H and R in modulated
system will be estimated.
In the eﬀective Lagrangian,
we retain up to the ﬁrst order with respect to the deriva-
tive of γǫ(r) or γµ(r). Therefore we need to estimate

the expectation value of H up to the ﬁrst derivatives of
the modulation functions. As for the expectation value
of R, we may neglect derivative terms as was discussed
in Sec. II C. The commutation relations needed to esti-
R
mate
are calculated by deriva-

The above estimation for the center of gravity suggests
that the position rc deﬁned by Eq. (42) may be regarded
as the center of gravity even in the case with modulation.
In the derivation of the eﬀective Lagrangian, we need to

estimated the inner product between the wavepacket and
its time-derivative. Finally we present the detail for the
calculation of this product, by regarding Eq. (42) as the
deﬁnition of the center of wavepacket.

APPENDIX D: BERRY CURVATURE AND
INTERNAL ROTATION

In a system with generic periodic structure, it is a
tough work to analytically calculate the Berry curvature
and the internal rotation. However, it is easy to obtain
them numerically by rewriting inner products of Bloch
functions and their momentum-derivatives to the prod-
ucts of conventional expectation values. Here we present
some formulae which are convenient for numerical calcu-
lations.

For latter convenience, we separate the Berry curva-

ture as,

k-derivative in the above expression in terms of the
Feynman-Hellman relation. However, in systems with

is a Bloch function

It should be noted that ΩE
nk and ΩH
nk have very similar
nk and S H
expressions to S E
nk, respectively. This suggests
that there are always some kind of rotation when the
Berry curvatures are nonzero.
In this sense, we have
generalized the argument for the quantum Hall system
in Ref. [34] to photonic systems. In the quantum Hall
system, the internal rotation is the internal orbital rota-
tion originated by the cyclotron motion under an external
magnetic ﬁeld. In the present case, on the other hand,
the internal rotation are the combination of the polariza-
tion and the internal orbital rotation originated from the
periodic structures. When there is no periodic structure
nor anisotropy in ǫ↔(r) and µ↔(r), Eqs. (D3a)-(D4b) are
reduced to the Berry curvature k
k σ3.
These contributions come only from the terms including
the spin operator S, and ∆nk = 0, i.e., nonzero ∆nk is
originated by the anisotropy or the periodic structure of
ǫ↔ and µ↔. Even in generic cases, ∆nk has a unit of a
length, and its magnitude is a lattice constant at most.

APPENDIX E: TRANSVERSE SHIFT IN
CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS

Here we prove the consistency between our result for
the transverse shift (Eq. (63)), which is consistent with
the TAM conservation for individual photons (Eq. (65)),
and the result by Fedoseev [26, 27], which is based
on classical electrodynamics.
[26, 27], each
wavepacket is constructed as a superposition of plane
waves with wavevectors k = kc + κ, where κ distributed
around zero vector. (In the notation of Refs. [26, 27], kc
is represented by K.) The polarization vector of each
constituent plane wave is deﬁned by Eq. (23) in Ref. [26]

In our constitution method for an incident wavepacket,

erwise, the concept “an elliptically-polarized incident
wavepacket” gets fuzzy (see Sec. III A 3). Thus, this is
a natural deﬁnition for an elliptically-polarized incident

p (κ)] at κ = 0. The amplitude re-

ﬂection/refraction coeﬃcients depend only on the polar
angle, and thus their derivatives by κy at κ = 0 are zero,
because the y-component of kc is zero in the present con-
ﬁguration. As was mentioned previously, z(i)
p are
independent of κ. Therefore, from Eqs. (E3a) and (E3b),
hA2 = 0, and we have

consistent with the TAM conservation for individual pho-

Note that the Berry curvature does not necessarily de-
crease with the energy increases in contrast to the sys-
tem without periodic structure, because nearly degener-

tude of the Berry curvature.

Following the same argument as the Berry curvature,
the internal rotation also has only the z-component for

APPENDIX G: REMARKS ON ∆TE nk

Here we evaluate ∆TE nk for the two-dimensional pho-
tonic crystal discussed in Sec. III C and see its eﬀect on
the energy dispersion and group velocity for each of the
ﬁrst and second bands of TE mode. From Eq. (48), an
additional correction appears in the energy of each TE
mode as

where ETE nkc;rc = γǫ(rc)ETE nkc . Figure 6 shows
∆TE nk for the ﬁrst and second bands of TE mode and
we can see ∆TE nk . 0.1a. Therefore, the correction is
at most a few percent as long as the modulation is suﬃ-
1. In order to make
ciently weak, i.e.,
the argument complete, we also calculate a correction to
the group velocity of a TE mode,

[43] Except for a simple system with a quadratic dispersion,
the concept of “force” often becomes ambiguous, while
the concept of “acceleration” is still well-deﬁned. This
issue is rather crucial for systems with spin-orbit interac-
tions, i.e., systems which are relativistic in nature. Here,
for the sake of convenience, we refer to the time derivative
of (lattice) momentum as the driving force.

[44] Although the arguments in Refs.[34, 35] based on the
ﬁrst quantized formalism, the reformulation in the sec-
ond quantized one is straightforward. Then the similar
argument can be applicable to photonic systems. In a
relativistic boson system like a photonic system, we can-
not construct a positive deﬁnite provability density. This
is why we have formulated our theory in the second quan-
tized formalism.

[47] This form of the Berry curvature, Ωk = k

k3 σ3, is speciﬁc
to the massless particle with spin-1. For the relativistic
fermion with mass m and spin- 1
2 , the Berry curvature in
the helicity basis is expressed by

Ωk =

(σ1eθ + σ2eφ) + ekσ3

,

k (cid:20)

m
Ek

(cid:21)

where Ek = √k2 + m2. In the massless limit, this coin-
cides with the Berry curvature of photon except for the
overall coeﬃcient due to diﬀerent magnitude of spin. In
the non-relativistic limit, i.e, increasing m with ﬁxing k,
the Berry curvature decrease as 1/m2 because the spin-
orbit interaction also scales in the same manner.

[53] This confusion mainly comes from two of advantages
of photonic systems which lead to the success of clas-
sical Maxwell theory. In contrast to electronic systems,
the statistics of photons is bosonic, and eﬀective self-
interactions between photons are usually very weak.

The characteristic function of soliton phase jitter is found analytically when the
soliton is perturbed by ampliﬁer noise. In additional to that from amplitude
jitter, the nonlinear phase noise due to frequency and timing jitter is also
analyzed. Because the nonlinear phase noise is not Gaussian distributed, the
overall phase jitter is also non-Gaussian. For a ﬁxed mean nonlinear phase
shift, the contribution of nonlinear phase noise from frequency and timing
jitter decreases with distance and signal-to-noise ratio.

INTRODUCTION

The phase jitter of soliton due to ampliﬁer noise, like
Gordon-Haus timing jitter1,
is usually assumed to be
Gaussian distributed2,3,4,5. When the phase jitter of
soliton was studied, the phase jitter variance was given
or measured and the statistics of soliton phase is not
discussed2,3,6,7,8.

For non-soliton systems, the statistics of nonlinear
phase noise is found to be non-Gaussian distributed
both experimentally9 and theoretically10,11,12,13. How-
ever, those studies9,10,11,12,13 just includes the Gordon-
Mollenauer eﬀect14 that is the nonlinear phase noise
induced by the conversion of amplitude to phase jit-
ter due to ﬁber Kerr eﬀect, mostly self-phase modula-
tion. Based on the well-developed perturbation theory
of soliton5,15,16,17, phase jitter can also be induced by
the interaction of frequency and timing jitter.
In this
paper, the statistics of the soliton phase is derived in-
cluding the contribution of timing and frequency jitter
induced nonlinear phase noise. The characteristic func-
tion of soliton phase jitter is derived analytically, to our
knowledge, the ﬁrst time. The probability density func-
tion (p.d.f.) is simply the inverse Fourier transform of
the corresponding characteristic function.

two consecutive pulses. To certain extend, a soliton
DPSK system may be a good approximation to phase
modulated dispersion managed soliton8 or RZ signal.
With well-developed perturbation theory5,15,16,17, the

∗Electronic address: kpho@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw

distribution of the soliton phase jitter can be derived
analytically.

The error probability of DPSK soliton signal was cal-
culated in Ref. 28 using the method of Refs. 29 and 30
without taking into account the eﬀect of phase jitter. If
the phase jitter is Gaussian distributed, the system can
be analyzed by the formulas of Ref. 31. The phase jitter
may be indeed Gaussian distributed in certain regimes
around the center of the distribution3,32, especially if the
p.d.f. is plotted in linear scale. The tail probability less
than, for example, 10−9, is certainly not Gaussian dis-
tributed. As optical communication systems are aimed
for very low error probability, a careful study of the statis-
tics of the soliton phase is necessary to characterize the
performance of the system.

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as
following: Sec. 2 gives the stochastic equations of the
phase jitter according to the ﬁrst-order soliton perturba-
tion theory; Sec. 3 derives the characteristic function of
soliton phase jitter; Sec. 4 presents the numerical results;
and Secs. 5 and 6 are the discussion and conclusion of
the paper, respectively.

The Wiener processes of wA, wΩ, wT , and wφ are in-
dependent of each other. The amplitude [Eq. (11)], fre-
quency [Eq. (12)], and timing [Eq. (16)] jitters are all
Gaussian distributed. From Eq. (19), it is obvious that
the phase jitter is not Gaussian distributed. If Eq. (4)
is linearized or all higher-order terms of Eq. (19) are ig-
nored, the phase jitter is Gaussian distributed and equals
ζ
to φ(ζ)
0 wA(ζ1)dζ1 + wφ(ζ) [Ref. 5]. The charac-
teristic function of the phase jitter Eq. (19) will be de-
R

3. CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTIONS OF
PHASE JITTER

In the phase jitter of Eq. (19), there are three indepen-
dent contributions from amplitude jitter (the ﬁrst term),
frequency and timing jitter (the second and third terms),
and the projection of ampliﬁer noise to phase jitter wφ.
In this section, the characteristic functions of each indi-
vidual component are derived and the overall character-
istic function of phase jitter is the product of the charac-
teristic functions of each independent contribution.

respectively. The ﬁrst term of Eq. (25) increases with ζ3,
conforming to that of Ref. 14. Given a large ﬁxed SNR
of A2/(σ2
Aζ) [Eq. (15)], the second term of Eq. (25) is
much smaller than the ﬁrst term and also increases with
ζ3. Note that the ﬁrst term of the mean of Eq. (24) is
also larger than the second term for large SNR.

The characteristic function of Eq. (23) depends on two
parameters: the mean nonlinear phase shift of A2ζ/2 and
the SNR of Eq. (15). Given a ﬁxed mean nonlinear phase
shift of A2ζ/2, the shape of the distribution depends only
on the SNR11.

Based on Eq. (19), comparing Eq. (23) with the non-
soliton case of Ref. 11, the mean and standard devia-
tion of the Gordon-Mollenauer phase noise of soliton are
about half of that of non-soliton case with the same am-
plitude A as the NRZ or RZ level11.

Comparing the means of Eqs. (24) and (29), in terms
of absolute value, the mean nonlinear phase shift due to
Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect is much larger than that due to
frequency and timing eﬀect. Comparing the variances of
Eqs. (25) and (30), the variance of nonlinear phase noise
due to Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect is also much larger than
that due to frequency and timing eﬀect.

Unlike the Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect, the characteris-
tic function of Eq. (28), from the appendix, is not deter-
mined only on the SNR and the mean nonlinear phase
shift Eq. (29).

C. Linear Phase Noise

The last term of Eq. (19) gives the linear phase noise of

(31)

with a characteristic function of

ΨφLN(ζ)(ν) = exp

.

(cid:19)

From the characteristic function of Eq. (32), the linear
phase noise depends solely on the SNR [Eq. (15)].

The characteristic function of the overall phase jitter
φ(ζ) is the multiplication of the characteristic functions
of Eqs. (23), (28), and (32).

Although the actual mean nonlinear phase shift is

as the second and third terms of Eq. (19).

By changing the order of integration for the second

term of Eq. (26), we get

<φ(ζ)>=<φΩ,T (ζ)> + <φGM(ζ)>,
(33)
we mostly call A2ζ/2 the mean nonlinear phase shift as
a good approximation in high SNR.

The p.d.f.
responding characteristic function. Figures 1 show the
evolution of the distribution of the phase jitter [Eq. (19)]
with distance. The system parameters are A = 1 and
σ2
n = 0.05. Those parameters are chosen for typical dis-
tribution of the phase jitter.

Figures 1(a), (b), (c) are the distribution of Gordon-
Mollenauer nonlinear phase noise [Eq. (23)], frequency
and timing nonlinear phase noise [Eq. (28)], and the lin-
ear phase noise [Eq. (32)], respectively, as components of
the overall phase jitter of Eq. (19). Figure 1(d) is the dis-
tribution of the overall phase jitter Eq. (19). The p.d.f.’s
in Figs. 1 are normalized to a unity peak value for illus-
tration purpose. The x-axis of individual ﬁgure of Figs. 1
does not have the same scale. From Figs. 1, the nonlin-
ear phase noises from Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect and fre-
quency and timing eﬀect are obvious not Gaussian dis-
tributed. With small mean and variance, the nonlinear
phase noise from frequency and timing eﬀect has a very
long tail.

Figures 2 plot the p.d.f.’s of Figs. 1 in logarithmic scale
for the cases of ζ = 1, 2. The Gaussian approximation is
also plotted in Figs. 2 for the overall phase jitter φ(ζ).
In both cases of ζ = 1, 2, the Gaussian approximation is
not close to the exact p.d.f.’s in the tails. However, if the
p.d.f.’s are plotted in linear scale, Gaussian approxima-
tion may be very close to the actual distribution, espe-
cially for large phase jitter32. The p.d.f’s in Figs. 2 are
not normalized to a unity peak.

From both Figs. 1 and 2, the nonlinear phase noises
of φGM and φΩ,T are not symmetrical with respect to
their corresponding means. While φGM spreads further
to positive phase, φΩ,T spreads further to negative phase.
Plotted in the same scale, the nonlinear phase noise of
φGM due to Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect is much larger than
the nonlinear phase noise of φΩ,T due to frequency and
timing eﬀect.

The p.d.f.’s in Figs. 1 cannot cover all possible cases.
While both the Gordon-Mollenauer and linear phase
noises depend on the mean nonlinear phase shift A2ζ/2
and SNR, the nonlinear phase noise induced by frequency
and timing eﬀect does not have a simple scaled relation-
ship.

For a mean nonlinear phase shift of 1

2 A2ζ = 1 rad14,
Figures 3 plot the distribution of the overall phase jitter
[Eq. (19)] for a SNR of 10 and 20 for ζ = 1, 10. After a
scale factor, the distributions of both Gordon-Mollenauer
and linear phase noise are the same as that in Figs. 2.
In additional to the overall phase jitter, Figures 3 also
plot the distribution of the nonlinear phase noise from
frequency and timing eﬀect of φΩ,T .

For a ﬁxed mean nonlinear phase shift and SNR, from
Figs. 3, the nonlinear phase noise from frequency and
timing eﬀect of φΩ,T (ζ) has less eﬀect to the overall phase
jitter for long distance than short distance. Figures 1 are
plotted for short distance of ζ
3 to show the contri-
bution of frequency and timing jitter to nonlinear phase

noise. The eﬀect of φΩ,T (ζ) is smaller for large SNR of
20 than small SNR of 10. The main contribution to the
overall phase jitter is always the Gordon-Mollenauer ef-
fect and the linear phase noise.

5. DISCUSSION

The phase jitter of Eq. (19) is derived based on the ﬁrst-
order perturbation theory5,15,16,17 of Eqs. (1) to (4). The
non-Gaussian distribution is induced by the higher-order
terms of Eq. (19) or the nonlinear terms of Eq. (4).
Second- and higher-order soliton perturbation33,34 may
give further non-Gaussian characteristic to the phase jit-
ter. Currently, there is no comparison between contri-
butions of the higher-order terms of Eq. (4) and higher-
order soliton perturbation.

are assumed independent of distance. If the amplitude
noise variance is σ2
n with dependence on the
instantaneous amplitude jitter, amplitude,
frequency,
and timing jitters are all non-Gaussian distributed35. As
an example, amplitude jitter is non-central chi-square
distributed35,36. However, the statistics of phase jitter
[Eq. (19)] does not have a simple analytical solution
when the noise variance depends on amplitude jitter.
With a high SNR, the amplitude jitter is always much
smaller than the amplitude A(0) = A. Even in high
SNR, the phase jitter is non-Gaussian based on Eq. (19).

6. CONCLUSION

Based on the ﬁrst-order soliton perturbation theory, the
distribution of soliton phase jitter due to ampliﬁer noise
is derived analytically the ﬁrst time. In additional to the
main contribution of Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect, the non-
linear phase noise due to frequency and timing jitter is
also considered. Induced by Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect or
frequency and timing jitter, the nonlinear phase noises
are not Gaussian distributed, neither does the overall
phase jitter. For a ﬁxed mean nonlinear phase shift, the
contribution of nonlinear phase noise from frequency and
timing jitter decreases with distance and SNR.

[10,39] does not have the limit of Eq. (A.9).

The characteristic function of Eq. (A.7) is that of a correlated two-dimensional Gaussian random variable of wζ with
(jν2, jν3)wζ,

dependence to ϕ1. The ﬁrst two terms of Eq. (A.6) is a quadratic (or bilinear) function of wζ, i.e., 1

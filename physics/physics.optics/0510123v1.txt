Abstract

A new kind of tridimensional scalar optical beams is introduced. These
beams are called Lorentz beams because the form of their transverse pat-
tern in the source plane is the product of two independent Lorentz func-
tions. Closed-form expression of free-space propagation under paraxial
limit is derived and pseudo non-diﬀracting features pointed out. More-
over, as the slowly varying part of these ﬁelds fulﬁls the scalar paraxial
wave equation, it follows that there exist also Lorentz-Gauss beams, i.e.
beams obtained by multipying the original Lorentz beam to a Gaussian
apodization function. Although the existence of Lorentz-Gauss beams can
be shown by using two diﬀerent and independent ways obtained recently
from Kiselev [Opt. Spectr. 96, 4 (2004)] and Gutierrez-Vega et al. [JOSA
A 22, 289-298, (2005)], here we have followed a third diﬀerent approach,
which makes use of Lie’s group theory, and which possesses the merit to
put into evidence the symmetries present in paraxial Optics.

Introduction

Optical beams are electromagnetic ﬁelds with a well distinguishable mean direc-
tion of propagation (that, from now on, we indicate as z axis), in the nearness
of which the most part of ﬁeld’s energy is contained during propagation. After
the publication of the fundamental work due to Durnin et al. [1], issued in 1987
about non-diﬀracting beams in free-space, there was a certain number of sci-
entiﬁcal investigations on optical ﬁelds with the structure of beams and which
possess, or approximate at least, the diﬀraction features of the aforesaid beams
[2]-[3]. Indeed, as an ideal non-diﬀracting beam is physically unrealizable, be-
cause on each plane z = constant it carries an inﬁnitive amount of energy, it
is possible to obtain diﬀraction-free like ﬁelds only with approximation: these
ﬁelds are also known as pseudo non-diﬀracting beams. Examples of that are
the well-known Gaussian beams, Bessel-Gauss beams [4] or other optical ﬁelds
recently introduced by casting the propagation problem in coordinate systems
diﬀerent of rectangular and circular ones [5] that share the properties of man-
taining a non-diﬀracting behaviour only inside a limited spatial range named

Rayleigh distance. In the present work, we wish to introduce another class of
pseudo non-diﬀracting realizable beams that we will call Lorentz beams (LB for
short) as well as their Gaussian apodizated version, that, to authors’s knowledge,
were never been study before today. If, from a theoretical point of view, the re-
search of new kinds of optical beams is interesting, it is particularly stimulating
in the present case because of the physical realizability of the proposed ﬁeld.
This realizability is not due to a Gaussian term, as usually happen for almost all
other known optical beams, but from a practical point of view it was shown [7]-
[8] that certain laser sources produce ﬁelds that shows fundamental variations
with respect to the canonical Gaussian beam. As well-known Gaussian beam is
a minimun uncertainty ﬁeld i.e.
it possesses the minimum achievable angular
spreading once the spatial extension is ﬁxed; for certain laser sources, e.g. dou-
ble heterojunction (DH) Ga1−xAlxAs lasers, which produce highly diverging
ﬁelds, a Gaussian description for the transverse ﬁelds fails: in this case it was
shown that a Lorentzian distribution is a better approximation, as it take into
account of the higher angular spreading, being equal the spatial extension [8].
The paper is organized as follows: in next section we introduce the LB and we
study their propagation under Fresnel or paraxial approximation. In particular
we give the closed-form expression for these kind of ﬁelds on a generical (x, y)
plane. Furthermore, we will make use of a theory group approach to introduce
another class of optical beams obtained by multlipying a Lorentz beams with a
two-dimensional Gaussian envelope.

2 Lorentz Beams and paraxial propagation

Let us suppose we have on a source plane, that we decide to be (x, y, z = 0)
plane, the following scalar ﬁeld distribution

V0(x, y) =

A

∈ ℜ

where A is a constant value and wx and wy are parameters related to the beam
width, with A, wx and wy
. This kind of ﬁeld is the product of two functions
of x and y variables which have the form of a Lorentzian function of parameter
wx and wy. The Lorentzian is a well known bell-shaped curve used principally
to describe the spectral lines of simple dinamical systems usually present in
physics. Starting from the ﬁeld in (1) we wish to derive the form that such
a ﬁeld acquires during free propagation. To do this, we pass to the Fourier
domain, calculating the plane waves spectrum on z = 0. We have

A0(p, q) =

where A0(p, q) is the complex spectrum, p and q are the conjugated variables
to x and y variables respectively. Once we know the spectrum of plane waves
on z = 0 we can calculate it on a generical (x, y)-plane as follows

Az(p, q) = A0(p, q) exp(2iπmz) = Aπ2 exp(

Observing the (2) we deduce that if the values of wx and wy are enoughly
greater than wavelength λ, the majority contribution to the ﬁeld arises from
homogeneous waves having the amplitude Az(p, q) corrisponding to points, in
Fourier plane (p, q), near to the origin. In this case one is authorized to do the
following expansion

It is important to note that the role of paraxial approximation was to give a plane

from a single Fourier variable, p or q; this is a properties that was not fulﬁlled
by the exact spectrum in (5) for the presence of the term exp(i2πmz). As a
consequence of that also the complex ﬁeld V (x, y, z) is in a similar factorized
form. To obtain a solution of (9) let us focus on the integral

amplitude evaluated to diﬀerent distances from the source.
In particular we
observe that, for distances suﬃciently shorter than zR the eﬀect of diﬀraction

3 Lorentz-Gauss beams

So far we have evaluated the paraxial propagation of the beam essentially by
using an integral approach. In fact, once we knew the ﬁeld on the source plane

namely we had

Actually we used (25) in Fourier space to obtain the plane wave spectrum on
z and from it, by mean an inverse Fourier transformation, we pointed out the
ﬁeld V (x, y, z). If we let

V (x, y, z) = exp(ikz)f (x, y, z)

where f (x, y, z) is the slowly varying part of V (x, y, z), we know that, if V (x, y, z)
fulﬁls the integral (25), then f (x, y, z) fulﬁls a diﬀerential equation, known as
paraxial wave equation, that in tridimensional space holds

mathematician Sophus Lie, that allows to perform an analysis on the symmetry
groups associated to a particular diﬀerential equation (or, more in general, to
a system of diﬀerential equations). Essentially, the theory says that there exist
some diﬀerential transformations which act like operators on system’s solutions
and that lead to others solutions of the same equation, when applied to an
existing and known starting solution. The theory bases itself upon a certain
number of theorems in the context of diﬀerential geometry, and we will not
enter in details; however, in Appendix we put a proof of the derivation of the
symmetry group we utilize in the following (see, for example, in [10] for the
theory foundations). This theory was used, for example, by Wunche [11] to
show that Hermite-Gauss and Laguerre-Gauss beams (with complex argument)
can be generated from the fundamental Gaussian beam simply by applying to
it the powers of certain diﬀerential Lie operators. Among all the symmetry
tranformations associated to (27) we concentrate upon only one which states
that if f (x, y, z) is a solution of the aforesaid equation also will be the function
f ∗(x, y, z) where

foundation of this result, i.e. an hidden symmetry [11] and which shows that all
beams with a Gaussian envelope are intimately connected to the paraxial wave
equation. As a consequence of (28) we immediately conclude that also exist the
Lorentz-Gauss beams, namely

The shape of this kind of ﬁeld depends by the choices of the parameters wx, wy, w0
and L. In particular if we choice w0 < wx, wy, we obtain a beams that behaves
like a Lorentz beam near to the z axis and like a Gaussian beam far from it. If
we put L = zR, Lorentz-Gauss beams (29) for w0 = wx(wy) shows a ﬁeld shape
more deﬁned around z axis with respect to the Lorentz beams (18), i.e. on the
y plane the LB has a wider bell-shaped ﬁeld function with respect to (29).

particular it is interesting to note that it deals of a rare case in which one is in
the presence of physically realizable ﬁelds, the propagation of which is known
in closed-form, that does not possess a Gaussian envelope term. This kind of
ﬁeld can represent a valid candidate to modelize the shape of ﬁelds generated by
certain laser sources, as double heterojunction (DH) Ga1−xAlxAs lasers. Using
a Lie group approach we introduced also the solution obtained by modulating
the aforesaid beams with a Gaussian envelope.

Consider the 3-D scalar paraxial wave equation

(30)

We wish to show that this equation admits a class of solutions that are mod-
ulated by a two-dimensional Gaussian envelope. First of all, to this equation
p, with p = 3
it is possible to associate a manifold M
q, with q = 1 meaning the
meaning number of independent variables and U =
number of dependent variables. On such a manifold it is also possible to deﬁne
a tangent vector ﬁeld in the following form

U , where X =

v = ξ(x, y, z, u)∂x + η(x, y, z, u)∂y + τ (x, y, z, u)∂z + φ(x, y, z, u)∂u

(31)

In the context of Lie group theory [10] tangent vector ﬁelds are the generators
of symmetry transformations through the following relationship

ψ(ǫ, v) = exp(ǫv)

(32)

where ψ is the transformation induced by the vector v and ǫ is a real parameter
characterizing the group. A symmetry transformation is a map that allows
to pass from a starting point (x, y, z, u) on the manifold M to another point
(x′, y′, z′, u′) on the same manifold by mean the relation

(x′, y′, z′, u′) = ψ(ǫ, v)(x, y, z, u) = exp(ǫv)(x, y, z, u)

(33)

To ﬁnd the explicit expression of the vector ﬁeld in (31), one can utilize the
following procedure. It is necessary to extend the space X
U in order that it
also contains the second order derivatives, an operation said prolongation. By
consequence the prolongated tangent vector ﬁeld becomes

where α is a generical function and ci(i = 1, 2, ...7) are integration constants.
Each of these constants is related to a particular generator of symmetry vi
which can be obtained by letting tidily all the constants to zero except the ith.
Among all such a transformations there is the following one

From (33)-(54) follows that, if we indicate as u(x, y, s) a solution then also the
following one represents a valid one

On coming back to the old coordinate z and letting ǫ/2k = 1/L and w2
it holds

0 = 1/ǫ,

u∗(x, y, z) =

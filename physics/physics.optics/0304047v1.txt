lattice site, while the vortex state comprises of four fundamental modes superimposed in a square
conﬁguration with a phase structure that is topologically equivalent to the conventional vortex.
However, in the weak localization regime, both the fundamental and vortex solitons spread over
many lattice sites. We further show that fundamental and vortex solitons are stable against small
perturbations in the strong localization regime. OCIS codes: 190.0190.

Discrete optical spatial solitons are localized modes
of nonlinear waveguide arrays that form when discrete
diﬀraction is balanced by nonlinearity [1]. When a low
intensity beam is focused into a waveguide array, the
propagating ﬁeld spreads over many sites (due to optical
tunneling) exhibiting a typical discrete diﬀraction pat-
tern with the intensity mainly concentrated in the outer
lobes [2]. However, at suﬃciently high power, the beam
self-traps to form a localized state.

Discrete solitons in waveguide arrays were ﬁrst pre-
dicted to exists as solutions to the discrete nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation [3] and later observed in AlGaAs
waveguide arrays [2]. This experimental observation
stimulated much new research such as diﬀraction man-
agement [4,5], soliton interaction and beam steering [6],
and discrete solitons in a two-dimensional (2D) photore-
fractive optical lattice [7–9]. The experiments in [7–9]
are particularly interesting since the 2D waveguide ar-
ray there is formed optically, thus it is very versatile and
easily tunable. This allowed a host of 2D localization
phenomena to be observed in [7–9]. However, many ques-
tions on discrete solitons in 2D optical lattices still remain
open. For instance, stability properties of such solitons
have not been carefully studied. In addition, new local-
ization states such as those analogous to vortex solitons
in a homogeneous waveguide have not been explored.

In this Letter, fundamental and vortex solitons in a
2D optical lattice are found and their stability analysed.
In the strong localization regime, the fundamental soli-
ton is conﬁned largely on one lattice site with a uniform
phase. The vortex soliton comprises of four fundamen-
tal modes located at the bottoms of the optical potential
in a square conﬁguration with a phase structure that is
topologically equivalent to the conventional vortex. By
winding around the zero intensity position along any sim-
ple closed curve, the phase of the vortex state acquires
2π increment. We call this structure a vortex cell. When
the localization is weak, both fundamental solitons and
vortex-cells spread over many lattice sites. In the strong
localization regime, we show that the fundamental soliton
as well as the vortex cell are both linearly and nonlinearly
stable under weak perturbations.

We start with the 2D nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation

is the optical lattice po-
where V = V0
tential, and V0 is its intensity. Such a potential can be
obtained by optically interfering two pairs of laser beams
[9]. Transverse distances X and Y in (1) have been nor-
malized by the lattice period D, and distance z normal-
ized by 4n0D2/πλ, where n0 is the refractive index, and
λ is the wavelength of the beam [9]. For typical values
D = 9µm, n0 = 2.3 and λ = 0.5µm [8,9], the unit dis-
tance z in (1) corresponds to 0.5mm in physical distance.
Without the lattice potential, solitons would suﬀer col-
lapse under small perturbations [12]. However, as we
shall show here, optical lattices can suppress the collapse
of fundamental solitons and vortex-cells.

Fundamental solitons. A fundamental soliton of Eq.
(3) has a single main hump sitting at a bottom of the
potential, say (X, Y ) = (π/2, π/2). Two examples corre-
sponding to propagation constants µ = 0 and 0.88 with
V0 = 1 are displayed in Fig. 1(c,d). We see that for
small µ (Fig. 1c), the beam is largely conﬁned on one
lattice site, while at higher µ (Fig. 1d), it spreads over
many lattice sites. To quantify these solitons, we cal-
culate the dependence of the normalized power P on
the propagation constant µ for V0 = 1 as displayed in
Fig. 1a. When µ → −∞, P approaches a constant 11.70.
This is apparently because in this limit, the fundamental

1

soliton is highly localized, thus it approaches the lattice-
free fundamental-soliton state, which has critical power
Pc ≈ 11.70. As µ goes to a cut-oﬀ value which is approx-
imately 0.95, P appears to go to inﬁnity. In this limit,
the fundamental state becomes uniformly distributed in
space. Thus, this cut-oﬀ value should be the boundary
of the band gap in the linear-wave spectrum [10]. When
µ ≈ 0.72, P is minimal. When µ > 0.72, dP/dµ > 0. In
this region, the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) theorem sug-
gests that the soliton is linearly unstable due to the pres-
ence of a purely-real unstable eigenvalue σ in the lin-
earized equation [11]. We have conﬁrmed this instability
by numerically simulating the linearized version of (1)
around the above soliton. The results for unstable eigen-
values are shown in Fig. 1b. On the other hand, when
µ < 0.72 (V0 = 1), the VK instability is absent, and the
soliton state is linearly stable.

For the two-dimensional self-focusing case, collapse is
an important issue. The above linear stability analy-
sis does not guarantee that the fundamental soliton will
not collapse under small perturbations. In the study of
collapse, the energy E plays an important role. In the
absence of the lattice potential [12] or when the poten-
tial is harmonic [13], the soliton collapses if its energy
is negative. In case the energy is positive, however, the
soliton collapses only if it is strongly perturbed. For the
optical lattice, we have calculated the energy E of fun-
damental solitons at various values of µ and plotted the
results in Fig. 1(a). The energy is found to be always
positive. Thus we can expect that this state is able to
withstand small perturbations without collapse. To con-
ﬁrm the above expectations on stability, we numerically
study the nonlinear evolution of the fundamental soliton
under small perturbations by directly simulating Eq. (1)
with initial condition

ψ(X, Y, z = 0) = u(X, Y )[1 + ǫup(X, Y )] ,

(4)

where ǫ ≪ 1, and up(X, Y ) is the initial perturbation.
We ﬁrst take up to be white noise. A large number of sim-
ulations with small ǫ and various realizations of random-
noise perturbations have been performed, and we have
found that for V0 = 1, if µ < 0.72, the fundamental soli-
ton is indeed stable against white noise perturbations;
when µ > 0.72, the soliton is unstable. To study the
nonlinear evolution process, we now take up = 1. For
V0 = 1, µ = 0 and ǫ = ±0.01, nonlinear evolutions are
plotted in Fig. 2a. We see that the perturbed soliton only
oscillates weakly around the fundamental-soliton state,
meaning that the soliton is both linearly and nonlinarly
stable. On the other hand, at V0 = 1 and µ = 0.88 (where
the soliton is linearly unstable), the dynamics is diﬀerent
as two scenarios are identiﬁed: (i) at higher input power
(ǫ > 0), the perturbed state relaxes into a z-periodic
bound state (Fig.2b,c); (ii) at lower input power (ǫ < 0),
the perturbed state decays into linear Bloch waves (Fig.

2b,d) (similar scenarios can be found in [15] for a diﬀerent
system). Collapse is not observed in either scenarios.

Vortex cell. In addition to the fundamental solitons,
we have numerically found vortex solitons as well. Two
examples with V0=1, µ = 0 and 0.82 are shown in Fig. 3
(b,c,d). At µ = 0 (strong localization regime), the vor-
tex state comprises of four fundamental solitons super-
imposed in a square conﬁguration with a phase structure
which is topologically equivalent to a conventional vortex
[see Fig. 3b,c]. By winding around the center along any
closed curve, the phase of the vortex acquires 2π incre-
ment, thus, we name it a vortex cell. At µ = 0.82 (weak
localization regime), the vortex cell spreads out to more
lattice sites and becomes more intricate, as can be seen
in Fig. 3d. But its phase structure is almost the same
as with µ = 0. We should point out that these vortex
cells are diﬀerent from conventional vortices without op-
tical lattice on a major aspect: their densities and phases

2

depend on both r and θ. The normalized power and en-
ergy diagrams versus propagation constant for these vor-
tex cells at V0 = 1 are shown in Fig. 3(a). This ﬁgure
is similar to that for fundamental solitons [Fig. 1(a)],
except that both P and E here are about four times
larger. Unstable eigenvalues σ of vortex-cells are deter-
mined by simulating the linearized equation (1) around
vortex-cells. The results are shown in Fig. 4a for V0 = 1.
We see that vortex cells experience an oscillatory instabil-
ity for µ > −7.8 and become stable for µ < −7.8. These
vortex cells also suﬀer the VK instability in the region
µ > 0.73 where dP/dµ > 0 [see Fig. 3a]. However, the
oscillatory instability is much stronger as it occurs over
a wider region and has a higher growth rate. Fig. 3(a)
shows that vortex cells also have positive energy. Thus, if
a vortex cell is linearly stable, it should be able to resist
collapse under small perturbations [13]. However, if it
suﬀers the linear oscillatory instability discussed above,
this instability could result in power exchange from one
part of the cell to another so that the intensity at some
small spots becomes high, triggering local collapse to oc-
cur. We have observed this scenario numerically. An
example is shown in Fig. 4(b,c,d) which displays the de-
velopment of a vortex cell with µ = 0 and V0 = 1 when
it is ampliﬁed by 1% initially.

In conclusion, we have studied new types of funda-
mental and vortex solitons in a two-dimensional optical
lattice potential, and shown that both solitons are stable
in the strong localization regime.

We next discuss the eﬀect of varying the potential
strength V0 on the formation and stability of fundamen-
tal and vortex solitons. For this purpose, we have chosen
V0 = 1.5, and repeated most of the above calculations.
The results are summarized as follows: (i) fundamental
solitons and vortex-cells exist at higher values of µ (up
to approximately 1.35); (ii) at the same value of µ, both
the fundamental and vortex solitons have lower power
(P ) and higher values of energy (E); (iii) the oscillatory
instability suﬀered by vortex cells is reduced (it could
even be completely suppressed when V0 becomes even
larger). Thus, we conclude that higher lattice potentials

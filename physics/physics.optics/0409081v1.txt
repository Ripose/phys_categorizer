Criteria for experimental observation of multi-dimensional optical solitons in media with sat-
urable refractive nonlinearities are developed. The criteria are applied to actual material param-
eters (characterizing the cubic self-focusing and quintic self-defocusing nonlinearities, two-photon
loss, and optical-damage threshold) for various glasses. This way, we identify operation windows for
soliton formation in these glasses. It is found that two-photon absorption sets stringent limits on the
windows. We conclude that, while a well-deﬁned window of parameters exists for two-dimensional
solitons (spatial or spatiotemporal), for their three-dimensional spatiotemporal counterparts such a
window does not exist, due to the nonlinear loss in glasses.

INTRODUCTION

Solitons are localized wave packets and/or beams that
result from the balance of the linear and nonlinear re-
sponses of a physical system. Depending on the physical
properties of the underlying system, solitons take dif-
ferent forms. They can be hydrodynamic wave packets,
such as solitary waves in the ocean [1] and atmosphere
[2]. They can also be spin-wave packets, such as mag-
netic solitons [3, 4]. Bose-Einstein condensates provide
a medium to produce matter-wave solitons [5]. Other
examples of soliton dynamics can be found in a wide
variety of ﬁelds, including astrophysics, plasma physics,
nuclear physics, and even metabolic biology [6, 7, 8, 9],
among others. Very accurate experiments have been per-
formed with topological solitons (ﬂuxons) in long Joseph-
son junctions, including a recent direct observation of
their macroscopic quantum properties [10].

Solitons in optics, which are known in their tempo-
ral, spatial, and spatiotemporal varieties (the latter ones
being frequently called “light bullets”), constitute, per-
haps, the most versatile and well-studied (both theoreti-
cally and experimentally) class of solitons in physics. In
particular, temporal solitons in optical ﬁbers [11] have
recently made a commercial debut in high-speed telecom-
munications links [11, 12]. It has been pointed out that
multi-dimensional (multi-D) spatiotemporal optical soli-
tons can be used in the design of high-speed all-optical
logic gates and, eventually, in all-optical computation
and communications systems [13].

The balance of linear and nonlinear dynamical features
is only the ﬁrst step in the soliton formation. Securing
the stability of this balance is the second, equally impor-

tant step. A well-known diﬃculty is that the most com-
mon optical nonlinearity – the Kerr eﬀect in dielectrics –
gives rise to soliton solutions which are unstable in more
than one dimension against the wave collapse, as dis-
cussed (in particular) in original papers [14, 15] and in
the review [16]. Several mechanisms that can suppress
the collapse have been investigated. These include satu-
ration of the Kerr nonlinearity [17], higher-order disper-
sion or diﬀraction (also referred to as ”non-paraxiality”)
[18], multiphoton ionization [19], and stimulated Raman
scattering (SRS) [20, 21].
In particular, importance of
the multi-photon absorption and SRS for the spatiotem-
poral self-focusing of light in the Kerr medium was in-
ferred from experimental data in Ref.
[22]. However,
these mechanisms eventually reduce the intensity and
cause the pulse to expand in time and space, preclud-
ing the achievement of multi-dimensional solitons [23].

Diﬀerent versions of the saturable nonlinearity (which
implies saturation of the cubic nonlinear susceptibility,
χ(3),
in high-intensity ﬁelds) have been studied theo-
It was shown that both rational
retically in detail.
[24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and cubic-quintic (CQ) [29, 30, 31]
variants of the saturation readily support stable two-
dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) solitons. A
diﬀerence between them is that the former cannot stabi-
lize “spinning” solitons with an intrinsic vorticity, but the
CQ nonlinearity makes it possible, in the 2D [32, 33, 34]
and even 3D [35] cases.

The ﬁrst observation of a self-trapped beam in a Kerr
medium was reported by Bjorkholm and Ashkin in 1974
[36]. The experiment was done in sodium vapor around
the D2 transition line, and self-focusing arose from strong
saturation of the transition (i.e. saturation of the linear
susceptibility, χ(1)). Studies of 2D solitons have made
rapid progress since the mid-1990’s in the study of two
new nonlinearities featuring saturation. Segev et al. pre-
dicted that the photorefractive (PR) eﬀect in electro-

optic materials could be exploited to create an eﬀective
saturable nonlinear index of refraction that would sup-
port solitons [37]. PR solitons were observed experimen-
tally soon afterward [38]. In parallel to this, there was
a resurgence of interest in the so-called cascading non-
linearity, which is produced by the interaction of two
or three waves in media with quadratic (χ(2)) nonlin-
ear susceptibility. Both 1D and multi-D solitons in the
quadratic media had been studied theoretically in nu-
merous works (see reviews [39] and [40]). Stationary 2D
spatial solitons (in the form of self-supporting cylindri-
cal beams) were ﬁrst generated in quadratic media by
Torruellas et al. [41]. Later, Di Trapani et al. observed
temporal χ(2) solitons [42], and, ﬁnally, spatiotemporal
solitons were produced by Liu et al.
[43, 44]. Under
appropriate conditions, both the PR and cascading non-
linearities may be modeled as saturable generalizations
of the Kerr nonlinearity (despite the fact that the PR
media are, strictly speaking, non-instantaneous, nonlo-
cal, and anisotropic). However, to date, multi-D solitons
in true saturable Kerr media have not been observed.

In this work, we examine the possibility of stabilizing
solitons (arresting the collapse) in saturable Kerr me-
dia [17], from the perspective of experimental implemen-
tation. Existing theories provide for parameter regions
where formation of stable solitons is possible, but neglect
linear and nonlinear losses, as well as other limitations,
such as optical damage in high-intensity ﬁelds [45]. First,
we propose a criterion for acceptable losses, and deter-
mine the consequences of the loss for the observation of
soliton-like beams and/or pulses.

Then, as benchmark saturable Kerr media, we con-
sider nonlinear glasses. Direct experimental measure-
ments of the higher-order nonlinearities and nonlinear
(two-photon) loss in a series of glasses allow us to link the
theoretical predictions to experimentally relevant values
of the parameters. As a result, we produce “maps” of the
experimental-parameter space where 2D and 3D solitons
can be produced. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst sys-
tematic analysis of the eﬀects of nonlinear absorption on
soliton formation in saturable Kerr media. We conclude
that it should be possible, although challenging, to ex-
perimentally produce 2D spatial and 2D spatiotemporal
solitons in homogeneous saturable media. Spatiotempo-
ral solitons require anomalous group-velocity dispersion
(GVD). Under conditions relevant to saturation of the
Kerr nonlinearity, material dispersion is likely to be nor-
mal. In that case, anomalous GVD might be obtained
by pulse-tilting e.g. On the other hand, the prospects
for stabilizing 3D solitons seem poor, even ignoring the
need for anomalous GVD. This conclusion suggests that
qualitatively diﬀerent nonlinearities, such as χ(2), may
be more relevant to making light bullets.

We focus on Gaussian beam proﬁles, which are proto-
typical localized solutions. Very recent work has shown
that nonlinear loss can induce a transition from Gaussian
to conical waves, which can be stationary and localized
[46, 47]. The conical waves are very interesting, but rep-

2

resent a diﬀerent regime of wave propagation from that
considered here.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The theo-
retical analysis of the necessary conditions for the forma-
tion of the 2D and 3D solitons is presented in Section 2.
Results of experimental measurements of the nonlinear
parameters (cubic and quintic susceptibilities, and two-
photon loss) in a range of glasses are reported in Section
3. Final results, in the form of windows in the space
of physical parameters where the solitons may be gener-
ated in the experiment, are displayed in Section 4, and
the paper is concluded by Section 5.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF NECESSARY
CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF TWO-
AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL SOLITONS:
LOSSLESS SYSTEMS

Evolution of the amplitude E of the electromagnetic
wave in a lossless Kerr-like medium with anomalous GVD
obeys the well-known scaled equation [24, 26, 27, 28]

iEz +

where z and (x, y) are the propagation and transverse
coordinates, and t is the reduced temporal variable, and
f (I) is proportional to the nonlinear correction to the
refractive index ∆n(I). In the Kerr medium proper, the
refractive index is n(I)
n0 + ∆n(I) = n0 + n2I, which,
as was mentioned above, gives rise to unstable multi-D
solitons, including the weakly unstable Townes soliton
in the 2D case [16]. Upon the propagation, the unstable
solitons will either spread out or collapse towards a sin-
gularity, depending on small perturbations added to the
exact soliton solution.

≡

Conditions for the soliton formation are usually ex-
pressed in terms of the normalized energy content, but
from an experimental point of view it is more rele-
vant to express the conditions in terms of intensity and
size (temporal duration and/or transverse width) of the
pulse/beam. They can also be converted into the dis-
persion and diﬀraction lengths, which are characteristics
of the linear propagation. We transform the results of
[15] to estimate the parameters of the 2D and 3D
Ref.
solitons in physical units. The transformation is based
on the fact that the solutions are scalable with the beam
size. Without losing generality, the estimation also as-
sumes a Gaussian proﬁle for the solutions. The relations
between the critical peak intensity necessary for the for-
mation of the soliton and diﬀraction length, in SI units
are:

0/λ0 is the diﬀraction length of the
beam with the waist width w0. Eq. (2) is easy to un-
derstand for the 2D spatial case. For the 2D spatiotem-
poral and the 3D case, we have assumed that the light
bullet experiences anomalous GVD, and has a disper-
sion length equal to the diﬀraction length, i.e. we have
assumed spatiotemporal symmetry for the system, as is
evident in Eq. (1). Further examination of Eq. (2) shows
that the beam’s power is independent of its size for 2D
solitons, which is a well-known property of the Townes
solitons, and the light-bullet’s energy decreases as its size
decreases in the 3D case [15].

As said above, two diﬀerent forms of the saturation of
the Kerr nonlinearity were previously considered in detail
theoretically, with ∆n(I) in rational form [24, 26, 27, 28],

and CQ (cubic-quintic) [29]-[34],

are usually treated separately (and, as mentioned above,
they produce qualitatively diﬀerent results for vortex soli-
tons), they are two approximate forms of the nonlinear
index for real materials. When the light frequency is
close to a resonance, Eq. (3) describes the system well;

results, we can estimate the necessary experimental pa-
rameters for both the 2D and 3D case by the transfor-
mation to physical units. The transformation is based
on scaling properties of the governing equation (1). The
estimate again assumes a Gaussian proﬁle, which yields

In the derivation of the above equation, we have used
the result from a CQ model for the 2D case [29]. The

0.16, which gives an error of

determine the boundary where the solitons start to be-

1.25Isat and Isat
[27, 28], which yields a result of Istable ≈
can always be expressed in n2 and n4 as described in Eq.

In general, these results show that the required inten-
sity decreases with (n2/n4). This means that a larger
self-defocusing coeﬃcient n4 makes it easier to arrest col-
lapse, as expected. On the other hand, a larger n4 also
makes the beam size larger. This is also understandable,
since stronger self-defocusing reduces the overall focusing
eﬀect and makes the beam balanced at a larger size.

III. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF
NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE
EXISTENCE OF TWO- AND
THREE-DIMENSIONAL SOLITONS: THE
LIMITATIONS DUE TO LOSSES

Up to this point, the medium was assumed lossless. In
real materials, saturable nonlinear refraction is accounted
for by proximity to a certain resonance, which implies in-
evitable presence of considerable loss. Strictly speaking,
solitons cannot exist with the loss. Of course, dissipation
is present in any experiment. The challenge is to build a
real physical medium which is reasonably close to the the-
oretical models predicting stable solitons. In particular,
this implies, as a goal, the identiﬁcation of materials that
exhibit the required saturable nonlinear refraction, with
accompanying losses low enough to allow the observation
of the essential features of the solitons. Under these con-
ditions, only soliton-like beams (“quasi-solitons”), rather
than true solitons, can be produced. Nevertheless, in
cases where losses are low enough for such quasi-solitons
to exist (the conditions will be described below), we refer
to the objects as “solitons”.

As candidate optical materials for the soliton genera-
tion, we focus on glasses, as they oﬀer a number of attrac-
tive properties [48, 49, 50]. Their χ(3) susceptibility is,
generally, well-known, varying from the value of fused sil-
10−16cm2/W) up to 1000 times that value.
ica (n2 ∼
The linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of glasses exhibit
an almost universal behavior that depends largely on the
reduced photon energy (¯hω/Eg, where ¯hω is the photon
energy, and Eg is the absorption edge, as deﬁned in Refs.
[48, 49, 50]). This results in simple and clear trends
that can be easily understood. The wide variety of avail-
able glasses oﬀers ﬂexibility in the design of experiments.
Glasses are solid, with uniform isotropic properties that
make them easy to handle and use. There are recent

experimental reports of saturable nonlinearities in some
chalcogenide glasses [51]. The saturable nonlinearity was
actually measured with the photon energy above the two-
photon absorption edge, hence this case is not relevant
to the pulse propagation, as the loss would be unaccept-
ably high. However, these measurements encourage the
search for situations where the nonlinearity saturation is
appreciable while the loss is reasonably low.

−

It is possible to crudely estimate the conditions that
will be relevant to soliton formation based on the general
features of the nonlinearities of glasses. The nonlinear-
1)th order will become signiﬁcant and
ity of the (2n
increase rapidly when the photon energy crosses the n-
photon resonance. Just as the nonlinear index increases
rapidly (and is accompanied by two-photon absorption,
0.5, we expect n4 to become signif-
2PA) when ¯hω/Eg
icant (and be accompanied by three-photon absorption,
3PA) when ¯hω/Eg
0.33. The requirement that n4 be
appreciable without excessive 2PA or 3PA implies that,
within the window 0.33 < ¯hω/Eg < 0.5, the solitons may
be possible.

∼

∼

To formulate these conditions in a more accurate form,
it is necessary to identify a maximum loss level beyond
which the dynamics deviate signiﬁcantly from that of a
lossless system. This issue can be addressed by theoreti-
cal consideration of quasi-solitons in (weakly) dissipative
systems. First of all, we ﬁx, as a tolerance limit, an appar-
10% peak-intensity
ently reasonable value of ℓtolerance ≡
loss per characteristic (diﬀraction) length, Ldiﬀr. From
what follows below, it will be clear how altering this def-
inition may impact the predicted parameter window for
soliton formation.

If the loss is produced by 2PA, the corresponding evo-

lution equation for the peak intensity I(z) is

dI

β2PAI 2,

(9)

where β2PA is the 2PA coeﬃcient. It follows that the loss
per Ldiﬀr (provided that the it is small enough) is ∆I

β2PAI 2Ldiﬀr. The substitution of the above deﬁnition

latter result leads to an upper bound on the intensity:

I < I2PA tolerance ≡

ℓtolerance
β2PALdiﬀr

.

(10)

Notice that the condition (7) implies that the diﬀraction
length cannot be too short, hence the upper limit in Eq.
(10) cannot be extremely high.

An analogous result for 3PA is

I 2 < I 2

3PA tolerance ≡

ℓtolerance
β3PALdiﬀr

,

which follows from the evolution equation [cf. Eq.
β3PAI 3. However, as will be discussed
(9)]dI/dz =
later, in the case relevant to the soliton formation, 2PA
dominates over 3PA.

−

4

On the other hand, within the distance necessary for
the observation of the soliton, its peak intensity must
remain above the threshold value (6), to prevent disinte-
gration of the soliton. Solving Eq. (9), this sets another
constraint on the intensity:

I0
1 + N β2PAI0Ldiﬀr

> Istable ,

(11)

where I0 is the initial peak intensity, and N is the num-
ber of diﬀraction lengths required for the experiment. In
this work, we assume N = 5, which is suﬃcient for the
reliable identiﬁcation of the soliton [43, 44]. Note that
the condition (11) can never be met if the necessary value
Istable is too high,

Istable > Imax ≡

In the case of I0 ≥
with the propagation will be
50%. We will refer to
the situation in which Istable > Imax as a “loss dominat-
ing” one, and the opposite as “saturation dominating”,
since 1/Istable and 1/Imax can be viewed, respectively, as
measures of saturation and loss in the system. When sat-
uration dominates over the 2PA loss, and hence creation
of the soliton is possible, Eq. (11) can cast into the form
of a necessary condition for the initial peak power,

I0 > Imin ≡

The material-damage threshold, Idamage, also limits
the highest possible peak intensity that can be used
experimentally. Although this threshold depends on
both the material and pulse duration, we will assume
100 GW/cm2, which is typical for nonlinear
Idamage ≃
glasses and pulses with the duration
100 fs. Thus, all
the above results can be summarized in the form

In a material with known nonlinearity and loss, experi-
mental observation of the solitons is feasible if the corre-
sponding window (14) exists.

A somewhat simpliﬁed but convenient way to assess
this is to deﬁne a ﬁgure of merit (FOM). In the case

The FOM is a measure of the range between the mini-
mum required and maximum allowed values of the peak
intensity. Of course, it must be positive, and the larger
the FOM, the better the chance to observe solitons.

It seems to be commonly accepted that a larger quintic
self-defocusing coeﬃcient n4 is always desirable, but the
above results show that this is not always true. From the
FOM we can see that a larger n4 is better in the sense
that it reduces the lower threshold Imin, helping to secure
the positiveness of the FOM (16). However, as soon as
Imin is low enough that the damage threshold no longer
poses a problem, Eq. (15) shows that larger n4 does not
help, and the loss factor β2PA dominates. One can under-
stand this, noticing that, although larger n4 reduces Imin,
at the same time it increases the beam’s width and makes
the needed experimental propagation length longer, as is
clearly shown by Eq. (8).
In turn, more loss accumu-
lates due to a longer propagation length, which oﬀsets
the beneﬁt of a lower Imin.

IV. MEASUREMENTS OF NONLINEAR
PARAMETERS OF GLASSES

The eventual objective is to answer the following ques-
tion: for a given category of materials (such as glasses),
with known nonlinear, loss, and damage characteristics,
does there exist a combination of material and wave-
length such that solitons can be observed? To this end,
we have measured the nonlinearity in a series of glasses
with 100-fs pulses from a Ti:sapphire regenerative ampli-
ﬁer with center wavelength at 790 nm. Sapphire is used
(it has ¯hω/Eg ∼= 0.25 in this case) as a reference material
with minimum nonlinearity. Although fused silica can
also be used for this purpose, sapphire’s higher damage
threshold allows us to measure at higher intensities.

cation of this method to take into account both higher-

FIG. 1: Intensity dependence of (a) SRTBC signal magnitude
(normalized peak-valley transmission diﬀerence) and (b) non-
linear absorption signal of As2S3. The saturation of the cubic
nonlinearity is evident. Higher-order nonlinearities, such as
χ(5), can be estimated from the deviation from χ(3). Insets
show examples of SRTBC and nonlinear absorption traces
(symbols) along with the best-ﬁt theoretical curves (solid
lines). The time delay (on the horizontal axis) is given in
units of the pulse duration (FWHM).

panels are predictions for the pure χ(3) nonlinearity. The
deviation of the experimental points from these curves
evidences the saturation of the nonlinearity. Postulat-

ing the presence of the χ(5) self-defocusing nonlinearity
provides for good agreement with the experiments. Sim-
ilar results were produced by all four samples used in the
measurements; in particular, in all the cases the sign of
the real part of χ(5) turns out to be opposite to that of
χ(3), i.e., the quintic nonlinearity is self-defocusing in-
deed. The measured χ(3) coeﬃcients are consistent with
previously reported values [48, 51, 54].

From these results, we also observe that higher-order
nonlinearities become more important as the optical fre-
quency approaches a resonance, as expected on physical
grounds. The χ(5) part of the nonlinearity is most signiﬁ-
cant for As2S3, while for sapphire it is below the detection
threshold.

V. STABILITY WINDOWS FOR THE TWO-
AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL SOLITONS

The measurements provide the information needed to
construct the window for the soliton formation. The re-
sults for 2D case are shown graphically in Fig. 2. The in-

To demonstrate the dramatic eﬀect of the loss, we also
plot the window for the (unrealistic) case when loss is
completely neglected (the hatched area). In the absence
of loss, the window is very large and the FOM increases
monotonically with the reduced photon energy. The
shaded area is the window remaining after inclusion of
the loss. It is greatly reduced compared to the lossless
case, and the best FOM is obtained near ¯hω/Eg
0.35.
From this diagram, we conclude that, while the satura-
tion of the nonlinearity is deﬁnitely necessary to stabilize
the soliton, major restrictions on the window are imposed
by the loss.

≃

From the above rough estimation that were based on
the band-edge arguments, one might expect that 3PA
would further curtail the window, when the 2PA eﬀects
are weak (which is the case exactly inside the predicted
window). However, n2 and 2PA have been observed in
glasses for the reduced photon energy as low as
0.35
[49], due to the fact that the band edge in glasses ex-
tends well below the nominal value. Since signiﬁcant
2PA remains in this region, 3PA may be neglected in-
deed. Hence, 2PA presents the fundamental limitation
to observing solitons in these media [as quantiﬁed by the
FOM in Eqs. (15) and (16)].

The results of the analysis for the 3D solitons are sum-
marized in Fig. 3. Note that another major issue in this
case is the requirement of anomalous GVD. This require-
ment is neglected here (addition of it will only further
constrain the window, which does not really exist even
without that, see below). From Fig. 3, we observe that,

FIG. 2: The operation window for the 2D solitons, as pre-
dicted on the basis of the experimentally-measured character-
istics of the glass. The hatched area is the window neglecting
the loss. The shaded area is the dramatically reduced (but
deﬁnitely existing) window found with the loss taken into ac-
count.

tensity limitations are plotted on the diagram against the
reduced photon energy. The parameter space can be di-
vided into two regions which were deﬁned above, viz., the
saturation-dominating and absorption-dominating ones,
with the boundary between then determined by Eq. (12).

tiotemporal 2D solitons and spatiotemporal 3D ones.
Using these criteria and measured properties of nonlin-
ear glasses within a range of reduced photon energies,
we have shown that the loss that accompanies higher-
order nonlinearities (which are tantamount to saturation
of the cubic nonlinearity) will set very stringent limits on
the material parameters appropriate for the experiment.
While loss was thus far neglected in theoretical treat-
ments of multi-dimensional solitons, this work motivates
more systematic studies of the soliton-like propagation in
lossy media.

The criteria developed in this paper can also be ap-
plied, as an assessment tool, to materials other that
glasses. More generally, the same rationale used for ob-
taining the relevant boundaries in this paper can also be
used in systems other than optical ones. In these cases
the speciﬁc mathematical forms of the boundaries will be
diﬀerent. In any case, the analysis presented here sug-
gests that there is a small but apparently usable window
of parameters in which 2D solitons can be generated, and
work is underway to address this possibility. On the other
hand, the prospects for generating 3D solitons in glasses
are quite poor.

even in the lossless case, the window (hatched area) is sig-
niﬁcantly smaller than in the 2D case. This is expected,
because collapse is stronger in 3D than 2D [16]. As in
the 2D case, the loss again is a major concern for per-
forming experiments. The most important inference is
that the window closes up completely when loss is taken
into account. Thus, it appears that loss will preclude the
creation of 3D solitons in glasses, while leaving room for
the 2D solitons.

Our overall conclusion is that a challenge is to perform
experimental studies of 2D solitons in saturable Kerr me-
dia. Both spatial and spatiotemporal solitons are possi-
ble to be produced experimentally. Among these two,
the 2D spatiotemporal case is more complicated since it
requires anomalous GVD. In general, this will naturally
constrain the window further. On the other hand, in
this case tilted-pulse techniques could be used to obtain
anomalous GVD. It is also possible to use a planar waveg-
uide to perform 2D spatiotemporal soliton experiments.
Of course, the predicted window depends on the
assumed parameters (such as the damage threshold)
and criteria (such as the 10% loss per diﬀraction
length).Variations in these parameters will naturally im-
pact the window, and our analysis provides the guide-
lines for searching for the most favorable materials and
wavelength. A next natural step is to perform numerical
simulations of the pulse propagation with the parameters
selected in the present work. It is conceivable that the
window for 3D solitons would ﬁnally open through vari-
ations of material parameters. In that case, one would
still have to ﬁnd an overlap of the resulting window with
the condition that the GVD must be anomalous. More
generally, non-glass materials may be tried to improve
the possibilities for the experiment.

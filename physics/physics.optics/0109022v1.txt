Abstract
We extend the T -matrix approach to light scattering by spherical particles to some simple
cases in which the scatterers are optically anisotropic. Speciﬁcally we consider cases in which the
spherical particles include radially and uniformly anisotropic layers. We ﬁnd that in both cases the
T -matrix theory can be formulated using a modiﬁed T -matrix ansatz with suitably deﬁned modes.
In a uniformly anisotropic medium we derive these modes by relating the wave packet representation
and expansions of electromagnetic ﬁeld over spherical harmonics. The resulting wave functions are
deformed spherical harmonics that represent solutions of the Maxwell equations. We use these
modes to express the equations for the T -matrix elements in terms of computationally tractable
coeﬃcient functions.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of light scattering by particles of one medium embedded in another has
a long history, dating back almost a century to the classical exact solution due to Mie [1].
The Mie solution applies to scattering by uniform spherical particles with isotropic dielectric
properties. More recently this strategy has been successfully applied to ellipsoidal particles
and some circumstances in which the dielectric tensor is anisotropic [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

Unfortunately, Mie–type solutions, although exact, are not always physically meaningful.
An alternative strategy useful in the long wavelength limit is the so-called Rayleigh-Gans (R-
G) approximation [9], which is closely allied to the classic Born approximation of quantum
mechanics. However, detailed information on the precise range of validity of this approxi-
mation often requires solution of the Mie problem, which is only available in some speciﬁc
cases.

There are a large number of physical contexts in which it is useful to understand light
scattering by impurities [10]. A particular example of recent interest concerns liquid crystal
devices. There are now a number of systems in which liquid crystal droplets are suspended
in a polymer matrix – the so-called PDLC systems – or the inverse system, involving colloids
now with a nematic liquid crystal solvent. These inverse systems are commonly known as
ﬁlled nematics [11, 12].

In such systems one needs to calculate light scattering by composite anisotropic particles
embedded in an isotropic or an anisotropic matrix. The model scatterer usually consists of
a small central isotropic particle (“the core”), coated by a much larger region in which the
optical tensor is anisotropic. This is equivalent to examining light scattering by a composite
particle consisting of the central core plus a surrounding liquid crystalline layer.

The analysis of a Mie–type theory uses a systematic expansion of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld over vector spherical harmonics. The speciﬁc form of the expansions is known as the
T –matrix ansatz. This has been widely used in the related problem of light scattering by
nonspherical particles [13, 14].

Recently in [7, 8] we have studied the scattering problem for the optical axis distributions
ˆϑ + nϕ ˆϕ. By using separation of variables and expansions over vector
of the form: nrˆr + nϑ
spherical harmonics, we have developed the generalised Mie theory as an extension of the T –
matrix ansatz [13]. This theory combines computational eﬃciency of the T –matrix approach
and well deﬁned transformation properties of the spherical harmonics under rotations.

In this paper we discuss this theory in more detail and explain how this approach can be

extended to the case of uniformly anisotropic spherical particles.

The layout of the paper is as follows. General discussion of the model is given in Sec. II.
Then in Sec. III we outline the T -matrix formalism for the isotropic medium in the form
suitable for subsequent generalisation. In Sec. IV, as the simplest case to start from, we
consider how the T –matrix ansatz applies for the radially anisotropic layer. We ﬁnd that
the structure of electromagnetic modes in the layer requires modiﬁcation of the standard
T -matrix ansatz. In addition, we detail computing the elements of T -matrix.

In Sec. V we describe the method to put the scattering problem into the language of
T –matrix by linking the representations of plane wave packets and of spherical harmonics.
For uniformly anisotropic scatterer we deﬁne generalised spherical harmonics and show that
the eﬀect of angular momentum mixing can be treated eﬃciently.

Finally in Sec. VI we draw together the results and make some concluding remarks. In
particular, we emphasise the importance of anisotropy eﬀects by making comparison between

2

angular distributions of scattered wave intensities for radially anisotropic layer and eﬀective
isotropic layer of the same scattering eﬃciency.

Details on some technical results are relegated to Appendices A – C.

II. MODEL

We consider scattering by a spherical particle of radius R1 embedded in a uniform isotropic
dielectric medium with dielectric constant ǫij = ǫδij and magnetic permeability µij = µδij.
The scattering particle consists of an inner isotropic core of radius R2, surrounded by an
anisotropic annular layer of thickness d = R1 −
Within the inner core of the scatterer the dielectric tensor ǫ, and the magnetic permittiv-
ity µ take the values ǫij = ǫ2δij, µij = µ2δij. The dielectric tensor within the annular layer
is locally uniaxial. The optical axis distribution is deﬁned by the vector ﬁeld ˆn. (Hats will
denote unit vectors.) Then within the annular layer ǫij(r) = ǫ1δij + ∆ǫ1(ˆn(r)
ˆn(r))ij and
µij = µ1δij. The unit vector ˆn corresponds to a liquid crystal director for material within
the annular region.

and uniform structures: a) ˆn = ˆr; b) ˆn = ˆz

We shall suppose that the director ﬁeld can be written in one of the following forms

(1a)
(1b)

where ˆr = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) is the unit radial vector; φ and θ are Euler angles of
the unit vector ˆr. ˆx, ˆy and ˆz are the unit vectors directed along the corresponding coordinate
axes.

In Fig. 1 we have shown these director distributions. Fig. 1a shows the radial (and
spherically symmetric) director distribution. The scattering problem in this case has already
been discussed by Roth and Digman [3], and in this case the spherical symmetry of the
problem plays an important role in rendering the Maxwell equations soluble.

We show in Fig. 1b the case in which the optical axis is directed along the z–axis and
is uniformly distributed within the annular layer; this is given by Eq. (1a). The case where

ˆn = ˆz
ˆn = ˆr

3

the scatterer is a long cylinder parallel to ˆn presents no diﬃculties and can be treated in
cylindrical coordinate system [15]. Scattering from spherical uniformly anisotropic particles
is not exactly soluble [15] and has been studied by using the Rayleigh–Gans method and
the anomalous diﬀraction approximation in [16, 17].

A simple limit of the physical situations we consider puts ǫ = ǫ1 = ǫ2, with µ = µ1 =
µ2. The ﬁrst condition allows us to concentrate on situations in which the scattering is
governed by the anisotropic part of the dielectric properties. This distinguishes our case
from other studies of scattering by spheres, in which the isotropic optical contrast dominates.
However, there is also a motivation for this hypothesis in terms of liquid crystal device
physics, and we shall discuss this at greater length in a subsequent paper. However, the
result of the hypothesis is that the scattering by our model spheres disappears in the limit
of zero anisotropy.

III. T –MATRIX APPROACH IN ISOTROPIC MEDIUM

A. T –matrix ansatz

In this subsection we remind the reader about the relationship between Maxwell’s equa-
tions in the region of a scatterer and the formulation of scattering properties in terms of the
T –matrix [9, 10]. Our formulation is slightly non-standard. Some technical details, which
can be omitted at ﬁrst reading, have been relegated to the appendices.

We shall need to write the Maxwell equations for a harmonic electromagnetic wave (time–

dependent factor is exp

{−

where ni = √ǫiµi are refractive indexes for the regions, where R2 < r < R1 (i = 1) and
r < R2 (i = 2); ki = nikvac (kvac = ω/c = 2π/λ is the free–space wavenumber). We deﬁne
the anisotropy parameter as u1 = ∆ǫ1/ǫ1 (in the annular layer). Then inside the isotropic
core u2 = 0. Finally, for brevity, in the region outside the scatterer r > R1, the index will
be suppressed, giving k

nkvac and u = 0.

In order to ﬁnd the coeﬃcient functions we use separation of variables. This implies
that the expansions (3) must be inserted into Maxwell’s equations (2). The coeﬃcient
functions then can be derived by solving the resulting system of equations. In the simplest
case of an isotropic medium the coeﬃcient functions can be expressed in terms of spherical
Bessel functions, jj(x) = [π/(2x)]1/2Jj+1/2(x), and spherical Hankel functions [19], h(1)

These formulae deﬁne the elements of the T –matrix in the most general case.

In general, the outgoing wave with angular momentum index j arises from ingoing waves
of all other indices j′.
In such cases we say that the scattering process mixes angular
momenta [13]. The light scattering from the uniformly anisotropic scatterer, depicted in
Fig. 1b, provides an example of such a scattering process.
In this case the cylindrical
symmetry of the optical axis distribution causes the T -matrix to be diagonal over azimuthal
indices m and m′: T nn′
jj′; m. Then we can conveniently rewrite the relation (10)
using matrix notations:

(11)

In simpler scattering processes, by contrast, such angular momentum mixing does not
take place. Many quantum scattering processes and classical Mie scattering belong to this
category. It is seen from Fig. 1a that radial anisotropy keeps intact spherical symmetry of
the scatterer. The radially anisotropic annular layer thus exempliﬁes a scatterer that does
not mix angular momenta. The T –matrix of a spherically symmetric scatterer is diagonal
over the angular momenta and the azimuthal numbers: T nn′

jj′,mm′ = δjj′δmm′T nn′

B. Scattering Amplitude Matrix

We have seen the relation between the scattered wave (7) and the incident plane wave (6)

The scattering amplitude matrix A(ˆksca, ˆkinc), which relates Esca and the polarisation vector
of the incident wave E(inc) is deﬁned in the following way [9, 10, 13]:

All scattering properties of the system can be computed from the elements of the scatter-
ing amplitude matrix. In Eq. (14) we see that this can be deﬁned in terms of the elements of
the T –matrix deﬁned in Eq. (10). Thus computation of these matrix elements is of crucial
importance.

Note that for unpolarised incident light this relation holds even if a scatterer is not spherically

We can now relate the scattering cross-section and the elements of the T -matrix. For
brevity, we restrict ourselves to the spherically symmetric case, considered at the end of
the previous subsection. More precisely, we consider the scattering eﬃciency, Q, that is the
ratio of Csca and area of the composite particle, S = πR2

In order to characterise angular distribution of scattered light intensity let us suppose
that the incident wave is linearly polarised and is propagating along the z-axis, ˆkinc = ˆz.

IV. SCATTERING FROM RADIALLY ANISOTROPIC LAYER

In Sec. III A we started from the general expansion for electromagnetic ﬁeld over the
vector spherical harmonics (3). Then the ﬁelds in isotropic medium were expressed in terms
of the modes, M( α)
jm (see Eq. (5)). This expression is known as the T -matrix
ansatz [13, 14].

jm and ˜M( α)

We shall write down the results for electromagnetic ﬁeld within the radially anisotropic
layer as they are given in [8]. These can be written in the form similar to the T -matrix
ansatz:

Ejm = αjmP(m)

In the next section we shall ﬁnd that the ﬁelds in uniformly anisotropic medium can also
be written in the form (26). However, the expressions for the normal modes in this case
will diﬀer from those of Eqs. (27). In both cases the modes represent solutions of Maxwell’s
equations and turn into the isotropic medium modes (5) in the limit of small anisotropy
parameter, u

0.

The radial anisotropy harmonics (26) do not involve angular momentum mixing and as
such they only have contributions proportional to vector spherical harmonics with angular
momentum numbers given j and m. The important diﬀerence between the two cases lies in
the fact that for the uniformly anisotropic layer this is no longer true.

The ﬁelds inside the isotropic core of the particle similarly also involve no angular mo-

We now pass on to the calculation of the scattering cross-section using the T –matrix
method. The formulae presented in this subsection form a key element in the input to this
calculation.

A. T –matrix: radial anisotropy

In order to calculate the elements of T –matrix, we need to use continuity of the tangential
components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds as boundary conditions at r = R2 and r = R1.
Equivalently, the functions p(α)

Finally, the analogous expressions inside the isotropic core have been given in Eq. (28).

In order to determine the T -matrix we shall insert these expressions into the boundary

V. SCATTERING FROM UNIFORMLY ANISOTROPIC LAYER

By contrast with the case of the radially anisotropic scatterer considered in the previous
section, the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the uniformly anisotropic annular layer can easily
be described in terms of plane waves. Unfortunately this does not render the scattering

problem soluble. The diﬃculty lies in satisfying the boundary conditions for a spherical
scatterer using the plane wave solutions of the Maxwell equations.

The starting point of the T -matrix approach to this case involves ﬁnding a representation
of the electromagnetic wave analogous to the generalised T -matrix ansatz (26). However,
for symmetry reasons, the structure of the modes representing the ﬁelds in the uniformly
anisotropic medium diﬀers from that in the spherically symmetric isotropic (or a radially
anisotropic) geometry. In particular, the lack of spherical symmetry implies that the angu-
lar momentum number j is no longer a good quantum number. However, the cylindrical
symmetry still guarantees conservation of the azimuthal number m.

The procedure is as follows.

In Sec. V A we provide methods of deﬁning modes in a
uniformly anisotropic material. These modes are: (a) solutions of the Maxwell’s equations
and (b) deformations of the isotropic spherical harmonics. The latter condition means that
the isotropic modes Eqs. (5) are recovered in the weak anisotropy limit, u
0. Then
in Sec. V B, we shall use these “quasi-spherical” wave functions to derive equations which
enable the elements of T -matrix to be computed for a uniformly anisotropic annular layer.

→

A. Angular Momentum Representation in the Anisotropic Layer

We have seen above that solutions to Maxwell’s equations can be written in two ways.
Either they can be expressed as plane waves, or, using a separation of variables approach,
they can be written as expansions over spherical harmonics. Deriving an expression for the
T –matrix will require us to make a connection between these two alternative expansions.
In this subsection we carry out this task.

To do this we begin with an isotropic medium. In this special case both the spherical
harmonics and the plane wave solutions are known. The result is a relation between the
plane wave packets and the spherical harmonics. The procedure will then be generalised to
cover the case of a uniformly anisotropic medium, so as to derive a set of ”quasi-spherical”
normal modes.

1. Spherical modes and plane waves in isotropic media

We start with the Maxwell equations (2) for an isotropic medium. Wave-like solutions to
these equations written in terms of spherical coordinate basis functions are given by Eqs. (4)
and (5). An electromagnetic wave can alternatively be written as a superposition of plane
waves:

This procedure has started from plane waves (36) and spherical harmonics (4), and ﬁnished
with Eqs. (40)- (41). This equation deﬁnes a basis set in the space of the angular dependent
amplitudes.

In fact we shall need to carry out the inverse process. The inverse process uses the
jm from

expansions (41) to derive the expressions for the spherical modes M(α)
superpositions of plane waves (36). The procedure works as follows:

jm and ˜M(α)

(a) We substitute the expansions of the amplitudes Ex(ˆk) and Ey(ˆk) from Eqs. (41) into

the superpositions (36).

14

(b) From the expressions for the electric (magnetic) ﬁelds we obtain the spherical modes

as coeﬃcient functions proportional to αjm and

µ/n ˜αjm ( ˜αjm and n/µ αjm).

−

(c) In order to deduce explicit analytical expressions for the modes, we expand the plane
waves over vector spherical functions by using Eqs. (B6). We then integrate the
products of Wigner D–functions over the angles φk and θk by using the orthogonality
condition (A10).

(d) Finally, the modes ˜M(α)

jm are derived from the expressions for M(α)

jm by changing the

Bessel functions, jj(ρ), to the Hankel functions, h(1)

j (ρ).

Note that, if a linear combination of Bessel functions, jj(ρ), represents a solution of linear
homogeneous diﬀerential equations (Maxwell equations in our case), then the corresponding
linear combination of Hankel functions generates another solution. This remark justiﬁes the
last step in the procedure described above.

The crucial point is that this inverse procedure can be generalised to a uniformly
anisotropic medium. Thus it can be applied to superpositions of plane waves representing
solutions of the Maxwell’s equations in the uniformly anisotropic layer, yielding expressions
for the modes used in the generalised T -matrix ansatz (26).
In the next subsection we
perform this generalisation.

2. Wave functions in an anisotropic medium

We start with the expansion (41), and use it to derive formulae for generalised spherical
harmonics in the anisotropic medium. The starting point is the well known result for plane
waves [21, 22, 23, 24]:

We now apply the procedure described at the end of the last section to the plane wave

generalised T -matrix ansatz (26). Now, however, the modes no longer take the form (27),

Explicit formulae for the coeﬃcient functions entering Eqs..(44b) are given in Appendix C
together with some related comments. Evaluating these coeﬃcients involves computing
some products of Bessel spherical function and Wigner D–functions and integrating these
expressions over θk. Their numerical evaluation is relatively easy.

The coeﬃcients with j

= j′ describe angular momentum mixing. It can be shown that

these terms go to zero in the absence of anisotropy, when u = 0 and ne = 1.

The modes introduced in this subsection can be used to derive expansions for incident
plane wave in the anisotropic medium. In an isotropic material the corresponding expansions
are given by Eqs. (6) and (9). In a uniformly anisotropic medium these expansions take an
exactly analogous form:

These equations can be compared to Eqs. (6). In the anisotropic case the spherical harmon-
ics (5) are replaced by by the “quasi-spherical” modes (43).

In order to prove this result we insert the coeﬃcients from Eqs. (9) into Eqs. (41)-(40b).

Then, after performing some rather straightforward algebraic manipulations, we obtain

B. T -matrix: uniform anisotropy

In Sec. IV A we solved for the T – matrix of a radially anisotropic layer. Computing the
elements of T -matrix required the solution of a set of equations resulting from the boundary
conditions (29). The only diﬀerence in other cases is that that appropriate modes for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the anisotropic layer must be used. For uniform anisotropy these
modes are given by Eqs. (44). Mathematically, Eqs. (30) and (31), which describe the ﬁelds
in radially anisotropic layer, are replaced by the following relations:

By analogy with the procedure adopted in Sec. IV A, this system of equations can now
be solved, in principle, to yield solutions for the quantities T α,β
jj;m which occur in Eq. (11).
However, the crucial diﬃculty in this case is that the algebraic structure of the equations
is complicated by the presence of angular momentum mixing. Thus, by contrast with the
radially anisotropic layer considered in Sec. IV A, we are now unable to derive expressions
for the elements of the T –matrix in closed form. The solution of this system of equations
now requires numerical analysis. In future publications in this series, we shall discuss this
problem in greater detail, and present some explicit results.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have developed a T -matrix approach which can describe light scattering
by spherical scatterers containing optically anisotropic material arranged in an annular layer.
We have conﬁned our discussion to the two cases, which we have called, using natural
language, radially and uniformly anisotropic systems. Just as in the related case when the
scatterer itself is anisotropic, but the scattering material is optically isotropic, the presence
of optical anisotropy aﬀects the algebraic structure which underlies the T -matrix theory.

From a mathematical point of view, the radial and uniform anisotropies present inter-
esting but contrasting features. Here we draw the reader’s attention to some of the most
striking of these.

The simplest case is the radially anisotropic layer. Here the scattering material is locally
optically anisotropic, but because of the way that the anisotropy is arranged, the scatterer
itself is spherically symmetric and remains a globally optically isotropic object. The result
is that there is no angular momentum mixing, although we do have to introduce the new
normal mode structure (26) within the anisotropic layer.

We shall discuss quantitative results in detail in a later paper in this series. However, it
is our purpose here to show brieﬂy that the anisotropy eﬀects can be important, even for
this relatively simple case. As an example, we compare scattering by a radially anisotropic
layer and a radially isotropic layer of the same dimensions, chosen in some some sense to be
the best guess to an equivalent isotropic scatterer.

Speciﬁcally, we consider scattering by a scatterer with a radially anisotropic layer as
discussed in section 2, with the ǫ⊥ within the layer matching ǫ in the core and outside the

scatterer, and anisotropy coeﬃcient u inside the layer. The equivalent eﬀective scatterer
has the same dimensions, possesses an isotropic layer of refractive index neﬀ, so that ǫeﬀ is
the dielectric constant and meﬀ = neﬀ/n is the optical contrast. The refractive index neﬀ
is chosen so as to match scattering eﬃciencies of the anisotropic layer and of the eﬀective
scatterer.

In Fig. 2 we compare the angular dependence of the intensities.

We compare the angular dependence of the scattering and the depolarisation factors in
the two cases. The aggregate scattering is the same, by deﬁnition. But disaggregated, we
get diﬀerent contributions, both when looking at angles and when looking at polarisation
shifts.
In the case we
have considered, the eﬀective scatterer gives a much more forward scattering signature, and
the relatively tiny backward scattering contribution has a very diﬀerent angular structure.
Likewise, we see from Fig. 3 that the depolarisation factor (25) as a function of the scattering
angle, θsca, is also very sensitive to the presence of anisotropy.

Given these relatively large eﬀects for what might be thought of as minor anisotropy,
there is every reason to suppose that the inﬂuence of a uniform anisotropic layer will be

even more profound. In this case the light-scattering problem is not exactly soluble. The
key point is that the exact solutions for uniformly anisotropic medium are known as plane
waves, whereas the spherical shape of the particle requires using some kind of spherical
modes.

In the case of the uniform anisotropy we have found it necessary to examine the relation
between spherical harmonic expansions and plane wave solutions of Maxwell’s equations.
We have found that, by choosing the appropriate basis in ˆk–space, we can deﬁne ’quasi-
spherical’ normal modes. These modes are exact solutions of Maxwell’s equations and as
such mix diﬀerent angular momentum. However, in the limit of zero anisotropy, these modes
tend to familiar spherical modes. More importantly, these quasi-spherical modes turn out
to be relatively easily accessible computationally. Thus, there is every reason to suppose
that the strategy can be adopted in rather more complicated situations.

One such problem is the light scattering problem for a Faraday-active sphere. This
problem has been treated using perturbation theory in [25] to explain the origin of magneto-
transverse light diﬀusion known as the “photonic Hall eﬀect” [26, 27].

We now try to place this problem in a more general physical context. We were ﬁrst
motivated by the technological problem of describing light transmission through media with

20

liquid crystalline inclusions, and the inverse problem in which the matrix is liquid crystalline
but the scatterers are isotropic. There is considerable current interest in such materials for
optical applications and displays. The complete problem of light transmission through such
materials not only involves the single scattering processes discussed in this paper, but also
more general multiple scattering processes.

The T –matrix formalism is a natural language within which to discuss such problems.
beginning with single scattering theories of the type discussed in this paper, one can in
principle construct an eﬀective medium theory using, for example, the coherent potential
approximation (CPA) or coated CPA [28, 29]. These theories determine eﬀective optical
characteristics of the medium from the condition that the scattering cross section is minimal
or equal to zero on average. Since this requires averaging over director orientations, it is
important to use basis functions with well deﬁned transformation properties under rotations.
This paper is the ﬁrst in series of papers designed to improve understanding of scattering
by optically anisotropic bodies, both singly and as components within complex anisotropic
media. In the next papers in this series, we shall carry out detailed calculations using the
theory presented in this paper, and compare the results with results derived using the simpler
Rayleigh-Gans (RG) and Van de Hulst or Anomalous Diﬀraction Approximations (ADA).

In conclusion, note that in case, when a series on the right hand side of Eq. (B5) or
Eqs. (B8) represent a solution of the Maxwell equations (2), we can obtain another solution
by replacing jj(ρ) with h(1)

j (ρ).

APPENDIX C: COEFFICIENT FUNCTIONS

By deﬁnition, the coeﬃcient functions that enter the expansions (44) are the matrix
elements (45).
In order to deduce the corresponding formulae we need to substitute the
expansions for plane waves Eqs. (B6) into Eqs. (43) and make use of the matrix elements
for the plane wave polarised along the z axis given by Eqs. (B8a)- (B8c). Note that Eqs. (5)
combined with the orthogonality condition for the vector spherical harmonics (A11) imme-
diately give the following relations:

Below we write the resulting expressions for the matrix elements that correspond to

transverse components of the wave functions (43).

Joint eﬀect of weak birefringent disorder and ampliﬁer noise on transmission in optical ﬁber com-
munication systems is properly described in terms of the Probability Distribution Function (PDF)
of Bit Error Rate (BER). The PDF tail, correspondent to extreme outages and thus anomalously
large values of Bit Error Rate (BER), was analyzed in [1]. In the letter we extend this analysis for
the case of the ﬁrst- and higher-order PMD compensation schemes.

PACS numbers: 42.81.Gs, 78.55.Qr, 05.40.-a

Although Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) is
hardly an issue for 10-Gb/s optical ﬁber systems, it is rec-
ognized as a major impairment in the case of 40-Gbs/s
or higher transmission rate. Full control of PMD may
not be achieved since the ﬁber system birefringence is
changing slowly (however, essentially) under the inﬂu-
ence of stresses, temperature ﬂuctuations, and other en-
vironmental condition variations [2, 3]. Thus, dynamical
PMD compensation became really a major issue in mod-
ern ﬁber optics communication technology [2, 4, 5]. De-
velopment of the experimental techniques capable of the
ﬁrst-order [6, 7, 8] and higher-order [8, 9] PMD compen-
sation have raised a question of how to evaluate the com-
pensation success (or failure). Traditionally, statistics of
the PMD vectors of ﬁrst-order [10, 11, 12] and higher
orders [13, 14, 15] is measured as a test for any partic-
ular compensation method performance. However, these
objects are only indirectly related to what actually rep-
resents the ﬁber system reliability. Thus, we have shown
in [1] that PMD eﬀects should be considered jointly with
impairements due to ampliﬁer noise, so that ﬂuctuatons
of BER, calculated as an ampliﬁer noise average for a
given realization of birefringent disorder, are essential.
We demonstrated that the probability of extreme out-
ages is much larger than one could expect from naive
Gaussian estimates singling eﬀects of either of the two
impairments. This phenomenon originates from a com-
plex interplay between impairments with well-separated
time scales (birefringent disorder is frozen, i.e. it does not
vary on all propagation related scales, while correlation
time of the ampliﬁer noise is extremely short). The eﬀect
can not be explained in terms of just the average value of
BER alone, or even the statistics of any PMD vectors of
diﬀerent orders, but rather should be naturally described
in terms of the PDF of BER, and speciﬁcally in terms of
the PDF tail, correspondent to anomalously large values
of BER. In [1] we have developed a consistent theoretical
approach to calculating this PDF tail. The case when
no compensation is applied and the eﬀect of the simplest

“setting the clock” compensation procedure on the PDF
tail suppression have been already discussed in [1]. In this
letter we extend this approach/analysis to study eﬀects
of the ﬁrst- and higher-order compensations on extreme
outages measured in terms of the PDF of BER.

We discuss the so-called return-to-zero (RZ) modula-
tion format, when pulses (information carriers) are well-
separated in time, t, and it is possible to consider the
pulses separately. The quantity measured at the output
of the optical ﬁber system is the pulse intensity,

I =

dt G(t) |KΨ (Z, t)|

,

2

(1)

Z

where G(t) is the convolution of the electrical (current)
ﬁlter function with the sampling window function. The
two-component complex ﬁeld Ψ (Z, t) describes the out-
put signal envelop (the two components correspond to
two polarizations of the ﬁber mode). The linear operator
K in Eq. (1) stands for variety of engineering “tricks”
applied to the output signal. They consist of the optical
ﬁlter part, Kf , and the compensation part, Kc, assum-
ing that compensation is applied ﬁrst and the result is
ﬁltered afterwards, i.e. K = Kf Kc. Ideally, I takes two
diﬀerent values depending on if the information slot is
vacant or ﬁlled. However, the impairments force devi-
ations of I from this ﬁxed values. Therefore, one has
to introduce a threshold (decision level), I0, and to de-
clare that the signal codes “1” if I > I0 but it stands
for “0” otherwise. Sometimes the information is lost,
i.e.
initial “1” is detected as “0” at the output or vise
versa. BER is the probability of such an “error” event
(with the statistics being collected over many pulses com-
ing through a ﬁber with a given birefringent disorder).
For successful ﬁber performance BER must be extremely
small, i.e. both the impairments typically cause only
small distortion to a pulse. It was already explained in
[1] that anomalously large values of BER may originate
solely from the “1 → 0” events. We denote the probabil-
ity of such events by B and examine its dependence on

the disorder.

Let us brieﬂy recall the major preliminary steps of our
analysis. The output signal Ψ can be decomposed into
two contributions: ϕ, related to a noiseless evolution of
the initial pulse, and φ, that represents the noise-induced
part of the signal. φ appears to be a zero-mean Gaussian
variable, completely characterized by the pair correlation
function

β(Z, t2)i = DξZδαβδ(t1 − t2).
Here Dξ is the noise strength, Dξ = ρ(ω0)l−1
s , with ρ
being the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE) spectral
density generated along a span, ls is the span length,
and Z is the system length. We consider (within the
same uniﬁed framework) either the case of distributed
(e.g. Raman) ampliﬁcation or discrete ampliﬁcation with
Z essentially exceeding the inter-ampliﬁer separation (i.e.
the span length). Note that φ is statistically independent
of both the chromatic dispersion and birefringence.

The noise-independent part of the signal is

where Ψ0(t) is the input signal proﬁle and η =
0 dz d(z)
is the integral chromatic dispersion (z is coordinate along
the ﬁber and d is the local chromatic dispersion). The or-
dered exponent ˆU depends on the matrix ˆm(z) character-
izing the birefringent disorder. The matrix ˆm can be rep-
resented as hj ˆσj, where hj(z) is a real three-component
ﬁeld and ˆσj are the Pauli matrices. Averaging over many
states of the birefriengent disorder any given ﬁber is go-
ing through (birefringence changes on a time scale much
longer than any time scale related to the pulse propa-
gation through the ﬁber), or, equivalently, over instant
states of birefringence in diﬀerent ﬁbers, one ﬁnds that
hj(z) is a zero mean Gaussian ﬁeld described by the fol-
lowing pair correlation function

hhi(z1)hj(z2)i = Dmδij δ(z1 − z2).

(4)

If this birefringent disorder is weak then the integral
Z
H =
0 dz h(z) coincides with the PMD vector. Thus
3DmZ measures the mean square average value of the
R
PMD vector.

Typical damage caused by disorder and noise must
be small. The weakness of the noise allows a saddle-
point evaluation of the noise averages. This leads to
a conclusion that DξZ ln B is a quantity that depends
on the birefringence, the shape of the initial signal and
the details of the compensation and measurement pro-
cedures, however, it is independent of the noise. Typi-
cally, B ﬂuctuates around B0, which is the zero disorder
(hj = 0) value of B. For any ﬁnite value of h one gets,
ln(B/B0) = Γ/(DξZ), where the factor Γ depends on h.
Since the noise is weak even small disorder can generate

2

a strong increase in B. This is why a perturbative cal-
culation of Γ, which starts with expanding the ordered
exponent ˆU in Eq. (3) in ˆm, describes the most essential
part of the PDF of B. Let us recall [1], that for the case
when no compensation is applied, one gets Γ ∝ H3, while
in the simplest case of the “setting the clock” compensa-
1 + H 2
tion one arrives at Γ ∝ H 2
2 .
One deduces from Eqs. (1,3) that the output intensity
depends on the disorder via the factor Kc ˆU . The idea
of the compensation is to build such a linear operator
Kc that dependence of Kc ˆU on h would become weaker
than of ˆU . The so-called ﬁrst-order compensation, cor-
responding to Kc = K1,

boils down to compensation of the ﬁrst term of the or-
dered exponential ˆU expansion in h [13, 14, 15]. Techni-
cally, this is achieved by sending the signal aligned with
either of the two principal states of the ﬁber [6], or insert-
ing a PMD controller (a piece of polarization-maintaining
ﬁber with uniformly distributed and well-controlled bire-
fringence) at the receiver [7]. Expanding K1 ˆU in h, sub-
stituting the result into Eq. (1), followed by evaluating
B leads to

where only the leading O(h2) term is retained. Here the
coeﬃcient µ′
2 is related to the output signal chirp, pro-
duced by either the initial signal chirp and/or nonzero
integral chromatic dispersion η. Recalculating the statis-
tics of Γ using Eqs. (4,6) one obtains the following tail

If the output signal is not chirped, then µ′

this case the ﬁrst non-vanishing term in the expansion of
Γ in hj is of the third order. Expanding K1 ˆU up to the

integral over h.
Integrating over h3 explicitly and ap-
proximating the resulting integral over h1,2 by its saddle

Eq. (9) is valid at DξZ ln(B/B0) ≫ µ3(DmZ)3/2.

The coeﬃcients µ′

2 and µ3 can be computed in the
introduced in [1], with
framework of a simple model,
the decision level threshold I0 being twice smaller than
the ideal intensity, the Lorentzian proﬁle of the opti-
0 dt′ exp[−t/τ ]Ψ(t − t′)/τ , and the
cal ﬁlter, Kf Ψ =
step function form for G, G(t) = θ(T − |t|). To ﬁnd
R
µ′
2, we consider a Gaussian weakly chirped initial signal
Ψ0 ∝ exp(−t2/2)(1 + iβint2), βin ≪ 1 (here both the sig-
nal amplitude and its width are rescaled to unity). Then
the output signal chirp is β = βin + η, η being the in-
tegral chromatic dispersion. Then, µ′
2 is proportional to
β, and the slope µ′
2/β found numerically (see [1] for de-
scription of the numerical procedure) is shown in Fig. 1
for a reasonable range of the parameters T, τ (measured
in the units of the pulse width). The values of ln B0 and
µ3 found numerically (for β = 0) are also plotted in Fig.
1.

There are various ways of improving the ﬁber system
performance even further. First of all, special ﬁltering ef-
forts can be made to enforce the output pulse symmetry
under the t → −t transformation. Then the O(H 3) con-
tribution to Γ will also be cancelled out and Eq. (8) will
be replaced by Γ = O(H 4). Second, one can use a more
sophisticated compensation Kc aiming to cancel as much
terms of the Kc ˆU expansion in h as possible. This ap-
proach known as higher-order compensation techniques
has been implemented experimentally in many modern
setting, see, e.g., [8, 9]. The higher-order compensa-
tion can guarantee an essential reduction in the Γ de-
pendence on h, leading to Γ ∼ µkH k (where k exceeds

3

by one the compensation degree if no additional cancel-
lations occur). Then logarithm of the tail of the PDF
of Γ (corresponding to large ﬂuctuations) is estimated
by −(DmZ)−1(Γ/µk)2/k. This results in the following
expression for the tail of the PDF of B,

ln S ∼ −(DmZ)

−1[µ

−1
k DξZ ln(B/B0)]2/k,

(10)

valid at DξZ ln(B/B0) ≫ (DmZ/µk)k/2. Eq. (10) gen-
eralizes Eqs. (7,9). One concludes that, as anticipated,
the compensation does suppress the PDF tail. However,
one also ﬁnds that the reduction of the outage probabil-
1
B∗ dB S(B), where B∗ is some ﬁxed
ity (deﬁned as O =
value taken to be much larger than B0) is, actually, mild:
R
−1
ln O ∼ −(DmZ)−1[µ
k DξZ ln(B∗/B0)]2/k. This implies
a call for a better compensation strategy.

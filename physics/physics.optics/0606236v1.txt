We study surface states of 1D photonic crystals using a semiclassical coupled wave theory. Both
TE and TM modes are treated. We derive analytic approximations that clarify the systematics of
the dispersion relations, and the roles of the various parameters deﬁning the crystal.

Keywords: photonic crystals, surface waves, semiclassical coupled wave theory

I.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals are artiﬁcial low-loss dielectric struc-
tures with periodic modulation of refractive index, which
have attracted considerable attention in the last two
decades. Due to Bragg reﬂection, electromagnetic (op-
tical) waves cannot propagate through such structures
in certain directions, at certain frequencies. Hence, pho-
tonic crystals can control the propagation of electromag-
netic waves in novel ways, with obvious application to
dielectric mirrors, dielectric waveguides, and dielectric
laser cavities.

As a way to eﬃciently inject light into a photonic crys-
tal (PC) waveguide, it has recently been proposed to use
surface electromagnetic waves (SEW)[1, 2]. In those pa-
pers, the photonic crystal was a two dimensional array
of rods, of inﬁnite length normal to the plane of inci-
dence. Instead, we have studied SEW on a semi-inﬁnite
one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystal sketched in Fig.
1. While retaining all useful properties of 2D and 3D
photonic crystals, a 1D dielectric periodic structure with
high refractive index contrast is more attractive from a
technological point of view.

The usual theoretical methods for wave propagation in
1D photonic crystals, including SEW , are the Floquet-
Bloch modal formalism, coupled wave theory, and the
transfer matrix method. Among these three, the coupled
wave approach[3, 4, 5] oﬀers superior physical insight and
gives simple analytical results in limiting cases. Unfortu-
nately, the conventional coupled wave theory of Kogelnik
fails in the case of high refractive index contrast, which
is essential for a functional 1D photonic crystal.

In this paper, we apply our recently developed semi-
classical version of coupled wave theory[6, 7, 8] to SEW
on 1D photonic crystals. The method is analytically al-
most as simple as conventional coupled wave theory, and
is practically exact for the achievable ratios (e.g. 1.5:4.6)

of the indices of refraction of the materials available to
build devices. We present here a uniﬁed description of
TE and TM SEW. A detailed account of the properties
of the TE surface modes has recently been given by us
in Ref. [9]; here we complement these ﬁndings with those
for TM modes, which are slightly more complex due to
the presence of Brewster points in the bandgaps. As a
result, we thoroughly clarify the systematics of solutions
for surface EM waves in semi-inﬁnite 1D photonic crys-
tals.

Our method is formally quite diﬀerent from that re-
cently presented in Ref. [10], or those in Ref. [11], so
in Section II we provide a short summary of the transfer
matrix approach, in the notation of our previous work[7].
In Section III we rederive the exact equations for SEW
of TM modes and obtain from them various analytic ap-
proximations for a semi-inﬁnite crystal. The analogous
equations for TE modes were given in Ref. [9]. With these
in hand, we discuss systematics of SEW. In Section IV we
apply the semiclassical approximations of Refs. [7] and [8]
to surface waves, and show that the second approxima-
tion is very accurate both for the dispersion relation and
the bandgap boundaries.

II. TRANSFER MATRIX METHOD FOR A
PERIODIC CRYSTAL

We wish to describe surface states that form at the
interface between a medium of low refractive index, n0,
and a semi-inﬁnite 1-D photonic crystal with layers of
refractive indices n1 and n2 and thicknesses d1 and d2.
We choose a coordinate system in which the layers have
normal vector along OZ. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal
is capped by a layer of the same material but diﬀerent
width, dc. For convenience of presentation, we split this
termination layer of index of refraction n1 and width dc

E = Ey(z)ˆeyei(kβx

ωt),

−

(1)

Using that det

−

into two sublayers, of lengths ds + dt = dc. The ﬁrst
sublayer extends from z =
ds to z = 0. Then the
periodic array that forms the 1D photonic crystal consists
of “cells” each made of three uniform layers of widths dt,
dt whose respective indices of refraction are
d2 and d1 −
n1 , n2 and n1. (If dt = d1/2, the unit cell will have
reﬂection symmetry, which simpliﬁes some relations, but
does not change any physical results.) The ﬁrst cell, given
index 0, ranges from z = 0 to z = d
d1 + d2; the second
is given index 1, and ranges from z = d to 2d, etc. The
p-th cell runs from pd to (p+1)d and has n(z) = n1 when
pd < z < pd + dt or pd + dt + d2 < z < (p + 1)d and
n(z) = n2 when pd + dt < z < pd + dt + d2. We choose
n1 > n2 > n0.

≡

For monochromatic TE waves the electric ﬁeld is par-

allel to the OY axis. As in Ref. [7], we write

is the vac-
where ω is the angular frequency, k = ω/c.
uum wavenumber and βk is the (constant) x-component
of the wavevector of modulus k(z) = ωn(z)/c. For an
electromagnetic wave entering the 1D photonic crystal
from a uniform medium, one has

β = n0 sin θ0,

(2)

where θ0 is the angle of incidence measured from the
normal. For monochromatic TM waves it is the magnetic
ﬁeld which lies parallel to the OY axis. Following Ref.
[8], we write

H = Hy(z)ˆeyei(kβx

ωt).

−

(3)

For piecewise constant ǫ(z) = n2(z), the solutions of
Maxwell’s equations for E(z) and H(z) in the p-th cell
are

Ey(z), Hy(z) = apeik1(z−pd) + bpe−ik1(z−pd)
= cpeik2(z−pd) + dpe−ik2(z−pd)
= epeik1(z−pd) + fpe−ik1(z−pd),

(4)

in regions pd < z < pd + dt, pd + dt < z < pd + dt + d2
and pd + dt + d2 < z < (p + 1)d respectively. Of course,
the coeﬃcients (ap, bp), (cp, dp), and (ep, fp) diﬀer for
TE and TM waves.

A numerical determination of the bandgap boundaries
conﬁrms that the gap width shrinks to zero at this point.

III. SURFACE TM WAVES

Most derivations are analogous to TE case, see Ref.
[9]. The magnetic ﬁeld of a surface TM wave is written
as

Hy(z) = aseik1z + bse−ik1z,

when

ds < z < 0 and

[10], this sign is char-
acteristic of each bandgap, unless the width shrinks to
zero in either an optical hole [10] or a Brewster point.
Returning to eq. (20), we can now write θλ−A explicitly
as

Note that all dependence on k on the r.h.s. of eq. (24)
is explicit in the second term. Note also that in taking
the inverse tangent we have introduced a contribution of
+2πν on the r.h.s. This term was discussed at length in
Ref. [9], so here we will discuss only the solutions with
ν = 0.

There is no simple analytic form for θλ−A as a function
of k, so numerical methods must be used to solve eq. (24).
However, the results can be better understood using a
simple graphical approach. In Fig. 2 we plot θλ−A(k)
(continuous line), and the r.h.s. of eq. (24) for a chosen
set of dc’s (dashed lines). One sees that θλ−A increases
from
π/2 to π/2 as k ranges from the lower to the upper
ﬁrst bandgap boundaries. In a more general context, this
property has been shown to hold in Ref. [12]. For a given
dc, the intersection of the corresponding straight line with
the continuous line determines the solution for k. As the
graph shows, when dc decreases, k increases. The values
of dc for which a solution can be found will therefore be

The same expressions also apply when β < βBr, but
then φs = 0.
If we choose β = 1.01, the limits are
dc,min = 75 nm and dc,max = 134 nm. The graphical
solutions are now shown in Fig. 3.

To proceed further in the analysis of the SEW solutions
requires values for the band edges kL, kR for a given β.
These can be obtained from our semiclassical approxi-
mation [8]. In Ref.
[9] we found very accurate analytic
approximations for the TE bandgaps. Formally analo-
gous expressions hold for TM bandgap boundaries, and
their accuracy is also excellent. We have also shown that
the semiclassical theory allows one to derive a good ap-
A. In the
proximate expression for the argument of λ

A. Approximate analytical solutions in the middle
of the ﬁrst bandgap.

SEW in the middle of a bandgap are of interest because
the damping is strong, so most of the surface wave is
conﬁned very close to the surface. For momenta such that
km << w one can make the simpliﬁcation sin−1(2(k

The dependence of k on dc, β and d1 is now transparent.
The role of the bandgap parameters km and w can also

The eigenvalue of the damped wave is λ(2) = (

)qe−γ2d.
Inserting A(1,2) and B(1,2) into eqs. (19), one ﬁnds the
corresponding predictions for k = k(β) of TM surface
waves. Selected results are shown in Fig. 7. As can be
seen, the second approximation gives excellent agreement
with the exact dispersion relation within the range of
validity β < n2 of the semiclassical coupled wave theory,
for the problem at hand.

In Fig. 8 we compare the exact and semiclassical results
for k = k(β), choosing three thicknesses of the cap layer
dc = 25, 50 and 75 nm. The ﬁrst approximation becomes
inaccurate when β exceeds 1.4, but gives accurate results
up to that value. The second approximation is so close to
the exact values that one can see the diﬀerence only for
values of β very close to the critical value β = n2 = 1.5.
Beyond that, our semiclassical approximation cannot be
applied, since k2 becomes imaginary.

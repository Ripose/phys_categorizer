Quantum Electro-Dynamics predicts that due to the coupling of photons to virtual

electron–positron pairs the polarization of a photon beam is altered by an external

magnetic ﬁeld. We show that due to quantum coherence the inﬂuence of magnetic

ﬁelds on the polarization of laser beams is enhanced with respect to naive expec-

tations by the photon occupation number. This magniﬁes the expected eﬀect by

several orders of magnitude, which may explain some of the recent experimental

observations. Since the photon occupation number is signiﬁcantly larger for pulsed

lasers, we expect that the eﬀect will be proportionally stronger in that case. Our

ﬁndings have the potential of opening new possibilities for the manipulation of laser

beams by external ﬁelds; they also imply novel phenomena in the interaction of laser

beams, and allow to increase dramatically the sensitivity of laser experiments to the

existence of new hypothetical particles, such as axions.

The response of quantum vacuum to strong external ﬁelds is a problem of great funda-

mental interest. However quantum vacuum eﬀects in electrodynamics are believed to have

little, if any, practical importance for the physics of laser beams at the intensities achievable

at present. This is because the strength of quantum eﬀects is determined by the product of

the coupling constant α

1/137, and the ratio of the ﬁeld strength and the electron mass

squared, which is small: αB/m2, αE/m2

Recent experiments [1], [2] have studied the polarization of laser beams by an external

magnetic ﬁeld, and reported the eﬀect which exceeds the QED predictions by several orders

of magnitude. These puzzling results justiﬁably have attracted a considerable attention.

In this Letter we will show that in laser beams the vacuum polarization eﬀects are en-

hanced with respect to naive expectations by several orders of magnitude. The enhancement

results from the coherent nature of laser radiation; its magnitude is proportional to the oc-

cupation number of photons in a coherent state. Our results may explain the puzzling

phenomenon of the change of laser beam polarization in external magnetic ﬁelds observed

experimentally [1], [2] and open new possibilities in the manipulation of laser beams by ex-

ternal ﬁelds, and in the physics of beam–beam interactions. We will also demonstrate that

the sensitivity of laser experiments to the existence of new light hypothetical particles, such

as axions, is in fact much larger than assumed before.

Let us consider a photon of frequency ω and momentum k propagating in the external

magnetic ﬁeld B0. This photon can decay into an electron-positron pair, which leads to the

absorption of photon beam with a rate κ(ω). The absorption rate depends on the photon

polarization. The photon polarization states are deﬁned with respect to the plane span by

the vectors k and B0: longitudinal, if the photon polarization vector is in that plane and

transverse, if it is perpendicular to it. In general, κ⊥(ω) > κk(ω) for all ω [3].

The refractive index n(ω) is related to the absorption coeﬃcient κ(ω)/(2ω) by the dis-

persion relation

There are several approximations made in the derivation of Eqs. (2a) and (2b). First,

we neglected terms of higher order in the external ﬁeld. This is a legitimate approximation
as long as B0 ≪
by the eﬀective Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian [5] which is the basis for the description of

Bcr, where Bcr = m2/e. In this case the dynamics is adequately described

light–by–light scattering in quantum electrodynamics. It describes the modiﬁcation of the

free electro-magnetic ﬁeld induced by the presence of virtual electron–positron loops in the

vacuum. In the leading order in electromagnetic coupling α it reads

Lint is the second term in the right-hand-side of (3). In general, P and M are vector

functions of the third order in the ﬁelds E and B.

Second, we assumed that the photon’s ﬁelds E′, B′ are much weaker than the external

ﬁeld. This allows to linearize Maxwell equations with respect to the photon’s ﬁeld. In this

case the polarization vectors become linear functions of the light beam ﬁelds and we have

tuting a plane-wave Ansatz for the beam ﬁeld, using the Maxwell equations and keeping

in mind that the refraction index is the ratio of the absolute value of the wave vector k

and the frequency ω one derives (2a) and (2b) for the longitudinal and transverse photon

polarizations.

Eqs. (2a) and (2b) represent well-known and undoubtedly correct results for the refrac-

tion indices of a plane electromagnetic wave. However, and this is the main point of our

paper, they do not apply to laser beams. Indeed, the laser beam is a coherent state

k and polarization λ [6]. To see the diﬀerence between the photo-pair production by a single

photon and by a coherent state, let us consider the S-matrix element describing the trans-

formation of the laser beam into an e+e− pair, which is proportional to the matrix element

of the photon annihilation operator; the coherent state is an eigen-state of the annihilation

operator, and we get

Eq. (12) can also be derived from the modiﬁed Maxwell equations if we keep in mind that

the coupling to the virtual electron–positron pairs summed up by the interaction term of

(3) is enhanced by the occupation number of photons in the laser beam.

To estimate the number of photons ¯Nk,λ we note that the total energy of a laser beam of
cross-sectional area S and coherence length lc is S lc E2. Since the energy of a single photon
is ~ω we ﬁnd that the number of photons is

For the laser light used in E840 [1], we have E = 5 KV/m and a wavelength λ = 514.5 nm

which translates into ω = 2πc/λ = 3.7

1015 s−1. Using (13) we arrive at the estimate (there

is an additional unit conversion factor ε0 for SI units):

·

This occupation number results according to Eqs. (11) in the enhancement of the polariza-

tion change eﬀect which may account for the experimental results of [1], [2]. The explicit

proportionality of the enhancement factor to the photon occupation number predicted by

Eqs. (11) makes our results amenable to future experimental tests.

Let us comment also on the implications of our results for other phenomena involving

laser beams. In the diagrammatic technique, our results imply that an external photon line
describing a coherent state should be accompanied by an additional factor of √ ¯N, so that an

eﬀective coupling constant is

e. As a result, all quantum eﬀects in the interaction

of laser beams get enhanced. This is especially important for the processes involving two or

more laser beams, as well as for the splitting of the laser beam in external ﬁelds and for the

interaction of laser beams with particle beams. The enhancement which we discussed above

may make QED eﬀects important already at the intensities achievable at present.

It has been proposed [7, 8] to use a conversion (real or virtual) of photons in external

magnetic ﬁeld for the search of new hypothetical particles, such as axions [9, 10, 11]. Our

results suggest that the cross section for the conversion in the case of laser beams is enhanced
by a factor of ¯N , which improves the bounds on axion mass and couplings. It also makes

feasible the detection even for the very low mass axions especially when pulsed lasers are

used, where the occupation numbers can be several orders of magnitude larger.

We consider the nonspherically decaying radiation ﬁeld that is generated by
a polarization current with a superluminally rotating distribution pattern in
vacuum, a ﬁeld that decays with the distance RP from its source as R−1/2
,
instead of R−1
P . It is shown (i) that the nonspherical decay of this emission
remains in force at all distances from its source independently of the frequency
of the radiation, (ii) that the part of the source that makes the main contri-
bution toward the value of the nonspherically decaying ﬁeld has a ﬁlamentary
structure whose radial and azimuthal widths become narrower (as R−2
P and
R−3
P , respectively), the farther the observer is from the source, (iii) that the
loci on which the waves emanating from this ﬁlament interfere constructively
delineate a radiation ‘subbeam’ that is nondiﬀracting in the polar direction,
(iv) that the cross-sectional area of each nondiﬀracting subbeam increases
as RP, instead of R2
P, so that the requirements of conservation of energy are
met by the nonspherically decaying radiation automatically, and (v) that the
overall radiation beam within which the ﬁeld decays nonspherically consists,
in general, of the incoherent superposition of such coherent nondiﬀracting
subbeams. These ﬁndings are related to the recent construction and use of
superluminal sources in the laboratory and numerical models of the emission
from them. We also brieﬂy discuss the relevance of these results to the giant
pulses received from pulsars.

Introduction

1.A. Preamble

Maxwell’s generalization of Amp`ere’s law establishes that electromagnetic radiation can be
equally well generated by an accelerated electric polarization current as by an accelerated
current of free charges.1 A remarkable aspect of radiation by such polarization currents is
that the motion of its source is not limited by the speed of light in vacuo; that is to say,
although the speed of no charged particle can exceed the speed of light, nothing prevents
the distribution pattern of a polarization current, created by the coordinated motion of
subluminal particles, from moving superluminally.2–4 This eﬀect has been observed in the
laboratory.5–8 Furthermore, since electric polarization arises from separation of charges, a
polarization current is by its nature extended, fulﬁlling the requirement that no superluminal
source can be pointlike; a superluminally moving point source would result in surfaces of
inﬁnite ﬁeld strength.2, 9

One of the simplest experimental implementations of a superluminal polarization cur-

2

rent6–8 employs distribution patterns that have the time dependence of a traveling wave
with a centripetally accelerated superluminal motion. Consequently, it is of great value to
calculate the radiation from such polarization currents.10–12 In Ref. 10, the ﬁeld of a super-
luminally rotating extended source was evaluated by superposing the ﬁelds of its constituent
volume elements, i.e. by convolving its density with the familiar Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld of a
rotating point source. This Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld is described by an expression essentially
identical to that which is encountered in the analysis of synchrotron radiation, except that
its value at any given observation time receives contributions from more than one retarded
time. The multivalued nature of the retarded time is an important feature of all superlumi-
nal emission; we shall begin, therefore, by describing the relationship between observation
(reception) time and retarded (emission) time for the particular case of a rotating source
with the aid of Fig. 1.

1.B. Multivalued retarded times, the cusp and temporal focusing

Parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 show the wave fronts that emanate from a small, circularly moving
superluminal source S. As we have already pointed out, no superluminal source can be truly
pointlike. Here we are considering a volume element of an extended source whose linear
dimensions are much smaller than the other length scales of the problem. The wave fronts
from S possess a two-sheeted envelope, a tubelike surface whose two sheets meet tangentially
along a spiraling cusp curve. At any given observation time, three wave fronts pass through
an observation point inside the envelope, while only one wave front passes through a point
outside this surface. The envelope and its cusp are the loci of observation points at which,
respectively, two or three of the simultaneously received wave fronts are tangential to one
another. To specify the retarded times t at which various wave fronts are emitted, let us adopt
a cylindrical coordinate system based on the axis of rotation and denote the trajectory of
the volume element S, shown in Fig. 1, by

r = const., ϕ(t) = ˆϕ + ωt,

z = const.,

(1)

where ˆϕ denotes the initial value of ϕ, and ω is the angular velocity of S. Let a stationary
observer be positioned at a point P, with cylindrical polar coordinates (rP, ϕP, zP). The
retarded-time separation R(t) between the source volume element and the obverver (i.e.
their intantaneous separation at the time t of emission) will therefore be

R(t) = [(zP − z)2 + r2

P + r2 − 2rrP cos(ϕP − ˆϕ − ωt)]

wave fronts (ﬁne circles) emitted by a small element S within an extended,
rotating superluminal source of angular velocity ω. S is on a circle of radius r =
2.5c/ω, or, in our dimensionless units, ˆr ≡ rω/c = 2.5; i.e. its instantaneous
linear velocity is rω = 2.5c. The cross-section is in the plane of S’s rotation;
dashed circles designate the light cylinder rP = c/ω (ˆrP = 1) and the orbit
of S. (b) Three-dimensional view of the light cylinder, the envelope of wave
fronts emanating from S, and the cusp along which the two sheets φ± of this
envelope meet tangentially. (c) The relationship between reception time tP
and source (retarded) time t [ Eq. (3)] plotted for ˆr = 2.5 and three diﬀerent
observation points. The maxima and minima of curve (i) occur on the sheets
φ± of the envelope, respectively. Curve (ii) corresponds to an observation point
that is located on the cusp. Note that the waves emitted during an interval
of retarded time centered at tc are received over a much shorter interval of
observation time at tPc. Curve (iii) is for an observation point outside the
envelope. (After Ref. 10.)

is plotted in Fig. 1(c) for the source speed rω = 2.5c, where c is the speed of light in vacuo.
Note that the ﬁeld inside the envelope receives contributions from three distinct values of
the retarded time [curve (i)], while the ﬁeld outside the envelope is inﬂuenced by only a single
instant of emission time [curve (iii)]. The constructive interference of the emitted waves on
the envelope (where two of the contributing retarded times coalesce) and on its cusp (where
all three of the contributing retarded times coalesce [curve (ii)] gives rise to the divergence of
the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld on these loci. There is a higher-order focusing of the waves, and so
a higher-order mathematical singularity, on the cusp than on the envelope itself. While the
singularity that occurs on the envelope is integrable, that which occurs on the cusp is not.
In that it occurs in the temporal as well as the spatial domain, this focusing is distinct from
that produced by a conventional horn, mirror or lens. The enhanced amplitude on the cusp
is due to the contributions from emission over an extended period of source time reaching
the observer over a signiﬁcantly shorter period of observation time.

The Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld derived in Ref. 10 was used as the Green’s function for cal-
culating the emission from a superluminal polarization current, comprising both poloidal
and toroidal components, whose distribution pattern rotates (with an angular frequency ω)
and oscillates (with a frequency Ω) at the same time.10 It was found that the convolution
of the density of this current with the Green’s function described above results in a ﬁeld
that decays nonspherically: a ﬁeld whose strength diminishes with the distance RP from the
source as R−1/2
P , within the bundle of cusps that emanate from the con-
stituent volume elements of the source and extend into the far zone. This result, which has
now been demonstrated experimentally,6, 7 was derived in Ref. 10 by setting the observation
point within the bundle of generated cusps and evaluating the convolution integrals over
various dimensions of the source.10 The steps in this procedure are listed below.

, rather than R−1

P

1. The integration with respect to the azimuthal extent of the source was performed by
means of Hadamard’s method.13, 14 It was shown that the Hadamard ﬁnite part of
the divergent integral that describes the ﬁeld of a superluminally rotating ring with a
sinusoidal density distribution consists of two parts: one part is exclusively contributed
by the two elements on the ring that approach the observer along the radiation direction
with the speed of light at the retarded time (i.e. the elements for which dR/dt = −c),
and the other part is contributed by the entire extent of the ring.

2. The integration with respect to the radial dimension of the source was subsequently

performed by the method of stationary phase.15

It was found that, when the radiation frequency is much higher than the rotation frequency
ω, the main contribution toward the ﬁeld of a superluminally rotating annular ring comes
from the vicinity of the point on the ring that approaches the observer not only with the wave

5

speed, but also with zero acceleration (i.e. the point at which dR/dt = −c and d2R/dt2 = 0
simultaneously).

These contributing source elements are the ones for which the time-domain phase tP =

t + R(t)/c is doubly stationary. Diﬀerentiating Eq. (3) with respect to t, we can see that

are equivalent to

and

and

dt2 = 0.

These conditions jointly deﬁne the point of inﬂection in curve (ii) of Fig. 1(c), corresponding
to the cusp passing through the point of observation P.

The collection of volume elements satisfying Eq. (4) within an extended source has a
ﬁlamentary locus that is approximately parallel to the axis of rotation for an observation
point located in the far zone (Fig. 2). The nonspherically decaying ﬁeld that is generated
by a volume-distributed source arises almost exclusively from the elements in the vicinity of
this narrow ﬁlament, a ﬁlament whose position within the source depends on the location of
the observer.

1.C. The zeroth-order evaluation of the angular position of the nonspherically decaying

beam

The angle of observation corresponding to the cusp, and the reason for the ﬁlamentary
structure of the contributing parts of the extended source may be inferred from the above
equations. Applying the ﬁrst condition in Eq. (4) to Eq. (2) and solving the resulting equation
for the retarded time t, or equivalently the retarded position ϕ = ωt + ˆϕ, we obtain

where

ϕ = ϕ± ≡ ϕP + 2π − arccos

∆ ≡ (ˆr2

P − 1)(ˆr2 − 1) − (ˆz − ˆzP)2.

In these expressions, (ˆr, ˆz; ˆrP, ˆzP) stand for (rω/c, zω/c; rPω/c, zPω/c), i.e. for the coordinates
(r, z; rP, zP) of the source point and the observation point in units of the light-cylinder radius
c/ω. (This radius, which automatically appears in the present calculations, turns out to be
the main length scale of the problem.)

The retarded times t± ≡ (ϕ± − ˆϕ + 2nπ)/ω respectively represent the maxima and minima
of curve (i) in Fig. 1(c) where n is an integer. Applying both conditions of Eq. (4) to Eq. (2),
we obtain Eq. (6) and ∆ = 0. The retarded time tc ≡ t±|∆=0 represents the inﬂection point
of curve (ii) in Fig. 1(c). Curve (iii) in Fig. 1(c) corresponds to an observation point for
which ∆ < 0, and so ϕ± are not real.

part of the source that approaches the observeration point with the speed of
light and zero acceleration at the retarded time, the orbit of this ﬁlamentary
source, and the subbeam formed by the bundle of cusps that emanate from the
constituent volume elements of this ﬁlament. The subbeam is diﬀractionless
in the direction of θP. The ﬁgure represents a snapshot corresponding to a
ﬁxed value of the observation time tP. The polar width δθP of this subbeam
decreases with the distance ˆRP in such a way that the thickness ˆRPδθP of
the subbeam in the polar direction remains constant: It equals the projection,
δˆz sin θP, of the ˆz extent, δˆz, of the contributing ﬁlamentary source onto a
direction normal to the line of sight. The azimuthal width of the subbeam, on
the other hand, is subject to diﬀraction as in any other radiation beam: δϕP
is independent of ˆRP.

The envelope of wave fronts comprises those observation points at which two retarded
times coalesce, i.e. at which t = t±. Inserting these values of the retarded time in Eq. (3)
and solving the resulting equation for ϕP as a function of (rP, zP) at a ﬁxed observation time
tP, we ﬁnd that

where

These equations describe a rigidly rotating surface in the space (rP, ϕP, zP) of observation
points that extends from the light cylinder ˆrP = 1 to inﬁnity (see Fig. 1).

The two sheets φ± of this envelope meet at a cusp. The cusp occurs along the curve

∆ = 0, ϕP = ωtP + ˆϕ − φ±(rP, zP)|∆=0,

shown in Fig. 4(a). It can be easily seen that, for a far-ﬁeld observation point with the
P)1/2, θP ≡ arccos(zP/RP), ϕP, Eq. (11) reduces to
spherical polar coordinates RP ≡ (r2

2π + · · · ,

P , where ˆRP ≡ RPω/c. [The higher
to within the zeroth order in the small parameter ˆR−1
order terms of this expansion are given in Eqs. (70) and (71).] In other words, the cusp that
is detected at an observation point (RP, θP, ϕP) in the far zone arises from the constructive
interference of the waves that were emitted by the volume elements at ˆr = csc θP, ϕ = ϕP+ 3
2π,
regardless of what their z coordinates may be. These volume elements therefore have a
ﬁlamentary locus parallel to the axis of rotation whose length is of the order of the z extent
of the source distribution along the line ˆr = csc θP, ϕ = ϕP + 3

2π (see Fig. 2).

1.D. The ﬁlamentary locus of the contributing source elements

The locus of source elements that approach the observer with the wave speed and zero
acceleration at the retarded time has a ﬁlamentary shape not only within the zeroth order
approximation in the small parameter ˆR−1
P , but in general. To demonstrate this, we need to
introduce the notion of bifurcation surface.9

When deriving the equation describing the envelope of wave fronts, we kept the coordinates
(r, ˆϕ, z), which label a rotating source element, ﬁxed and found the surface in the space
(rP, ϕP, zP) of observation points on which dR/dt = −c at a given time tP. If we keep
(rP, ϕP, zP) and tP ﬁxed, then dR/dt = −c would describe a surface that resides in the space
(r, ϕ, z) of source points: the so-called bifurcation surface of the observation point P. Like

8

the envelope, the bifurcation surface consists of two sheets that meet tangentially along a
cusp (a spiraling curve on which d2R/dt2 = 0), but the bifurcation surface issues from the
observation point P (rather than the source point S) and spirals about the rotation axis in the
opposite direction to the envelope (see Fig. 3). The similarity between the two surfaces stems
from the following reciprocity properties of P and S: the equation describing the envelope,
Eq. (8), remains invariant under the interchanges r ↔ rP, z ↔ zP, ϕ ↔ −ϕP, t ↔ −tP.

Fig. 3. The bifurcation surface of the observation point P for a source whose
rotational motion is clockwise. The source points that lie inside this surface
inﬂuence the ﬁeld at P at three distinct values of the retarded time, while
those that lie outside this surface inﬂuence the ﬁeld at only a single value of
the retarded time. The source elements on the ﬁlamentary locus at which the
cusp curve of this surface intersects the source distribution approach P with
the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time and so generate
a nonspherically decaying ﬁeld at P.

The locus of source elements that approach an observer P with the wave speed and zero
acceleration at the retarded time is given by the intersection of the cusp curve of the bifurca-
tion surface of P with the volume of the source. This ﬁlamentary locus has exactly the same
shape as the cusp curve of the envelope [shown in Fig. 4(a)], except that it resides in the
space of source points, instead of the space of observation points, and points in the direction
of the source velocity. The projection of this curve onto the (r, z) plane consists of a branch
of a hyperbola with asymptotes that lie along the angles arcsin(ˆr−1
P ) with
respect to the z axis [see Fig. 4(b)]. For an observation point that is located in the far zone,

P ) and π −arcsin(ˆr−1

9

therefore, the projection of the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface onto the (r, z) plane is
virtually parallel to the rotation axis.

The reciprocity relations referred to above ensure that if a source element S is located on
the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface of an observer P, then the envelope of the wave
fronts emitted by S would have a cusp passing through P (or, conversely, if an observer P
is located on the cusp curve of the envelope of wave fronts emitted by a source element
S, then the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface of P would pass through S). In the case
of a single point source, the retarded position ϕ of the source linearly changes with time
(ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt), and so the cusp that it generates is both spiral-shaped and rigidly rotates
about the z axis. In the case of an extended source, on the other hand, the position ϕ of
each contributing source element (an element that lies on the cusp curve of the bifurcation
surface of a far-ﬁeld observer P) is ﬁxed (ϕ = ϕP + 3π/2, ˆr = csc θP), and the elements that
occupy that position are constantly changing. The cusps generated by the moving source
elements that pass through this ﬁxed position at various retarded times have a locus, at any
given observation time, that is straight and stationary as shown in Fig. 2. In other words,
the source elements constituting the ﬁlament at ϕ = ϕP + 3π/2, ˆr = csc θP, each contribute a
quasi-instantaneous ‘pulse’ of nonspherically decaying electromagnetic radiation that in the
far ﬁeld appears to have propagated out along a virtually straight-line locus deﬁned by the
angle θP = arcsin(ˆr−1).

1.E. Objectives and organization of the paper

The objectives of the present paper are as follows (the location of the resolution of each
objective is given in brackets):

1. to show that the nonspherical decay of the radiation ﬁeld that arises from a rotating
superluminal source remains in force at all distances from this source independently of
the frequency of the radiation (Section 3.D);

2. to specify the dimensions of the ﬁlamentary part of the source that makes the main
contribution toward the value of the nonspherically decaying ﬁeld [Eqs. (61)–(62)];

3. to show that the bundle of cusps emanating from this ﬁlament delineates a radiation
‘subbeam’ that is nondiﬀracting in one dimension; that is to say, the width of this
beam in the polar direction remains the same at all distances from the source [Fig. 2,
Eq. (73)];

4. to clarify how the requirements of conservation of energy are met by the nonspherically
decaying radiation: the cross-sectional area of each nondiﬀracting subbeam increases
as RP, rather than R2

P, with the distance RP from the source (Section 4); and

10

5. to show that the overall radiation beam within which the ﬁeld decays nonspherically
consists, in general, of an incoherent superposition of the coherent nondiﬀracting sub-
beams described above (Section 4).

We begin with the mathematical formulation of the problem in Section 2. In Section 3,
we show that objectives 1 and 2 can be achieved by replacing the method of stationary
phase used in Ref. 10 with the method of steepest descents.16 By converting the Fourier-
type integral over the radial extent of the source to a Laplace-type integral and making
use of contour integration, we present an asymptotic analysis for which the large parameter
is the distance from the source (in units of the light-cylinder radius c/ω) rather than the
radiation frequency. Not only is there no restriction on the range of frequencies for which the
emission from a rotating superluminal source decays nonspherically, but the more distant
the observation point, the more accurate the asymptotic analysis that predicts this decay
rate.

The more poweful asymptotic technique we employ here establishes, moreover, that the
transverse dimensions of the ﬁlamentary part of the source responsible for the nonspherically
decaying ﬁeld are of the order of δˆr ∝ ˆR−2
P in the
azimuthal direction (see Section 4). The dimension of this ﬁlament in the direction parallel
to the rotation axis is of the order of the length scale of the source distribution in that
direction.

P in the radial direction and δϕ ∝ ˆR−3

The corresponding dimensions of the bundle of cusps that emanate from the contributing
source elements can be easily inferred from the above dimensions of the ﬁlamentary region
containing these elements. The cusps occupy a solid angle in the space of observation points
whose azimuthal width δϕP has a constant value (as does a conventional radiation beam)
but whose polar width δθP decreases with the distance RP as R−1
P . This may be seen by
considering a cohort of propagating polarization-current volume elements that are at the
same azimuthal angle ϕ and radius r (possessing the same speed rω) but at diﬀering heights
z. Each will give rise to a cusp in the far zone that forms the angle θP = arcsin(ˆr−1) with the
z axis, but starts from a diﬀerent height at the light cylinder (see Fig. 2). The spatial extent
in the direction of increasing θP of the composite set of cusps from this cohort of volume
elements (the subbeam) will therefore be determined solely by the height δz of the region
conﬁning the polarization current. Projected onto a direction normal to the line of sight,
this will result in a width w = |δz| sin θP occupied by the cusps that is independent of the
distance RP from the source. (Note that w is a ﬁxed linear width, rather than an angular
width.)

Thus, the area R2

P sin θPδθPϕP subtended by the bundle of cusps deﬁning this subbeam
increases as RP, rather than R2
P, with the distance RP from the source. In order that the ﬂux
of energy remain the same across a cross section of the subbeam, therefore, it is essential

11

P , rather
P . This requirement is, of course, met automatically by the radiation that propagates

that the Poynting vector associated with this radiation correspondingly decay as R−1
than R−2
along the nondiﬀracting subbeam.

For a rotating superluminal source with the radial boundaries ˆr< > 1 and ˆr> > ˆr<, the
nonspherically decaying radiation is detectable in the far zone only within the conical shell

arcsin(1/ˆr>) ≤ θP ≤ arcsin(1/ˆr<).

(13)

These limits on θP merely reﬂect the fact that a rigidly rotating extended source with ﬁnite
radial spread entails a limited range of linear speeds rω; Eq. (12) shows that a limited range
of speeds results in a limited spread in the angular positions of the generated subbeams. The
overall beam described by Eq. (13) consists, in general, of a superposition of nondiﬀracting
subbeams with widely diﬀering amplitudes and phases. The individual subbeams (which
would be narrower and more distinguishable, the further away is the observer from the
source) decay nonspherically, but the incoherence of their phase relationships ensures that
the integrated ﬂux of energy associated with their superposition across this ﬁnite solid angle
remains independent of RP.

Having made a preliminary description of the salient features of the analysis, we now
embark on the detailed treatment of the problem in Sections 2 to 4. We conclude in Section 5
with some remarks on the applicability of our analysis to numerical calculations of the
emission from superluminal sources and to the observational data on the giant pulses received
from pulsars.

2. The nonspherically decaying component of the radiation ﬁeld from a rotating

superluminal source

As in Ref. 10, we base our analysis on a polarization current density j = ∂P/∂t for which

Pr,ϕ,z(r, ϕ, z, t) = sr,ϕ,z(r, z) cos(m ˆϕ) cos(Ωt),

−π < ˆϕ ≤ π,

(14)

with

ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt,

(15)

where Pr,ϕ,z are the components of the polarization P in a cylindrical coordinate system
based on the axis of rotation, s(r, z) is an arbitrary vector that vanishes outside a ﬁnite
region of the (r, z) space, and m is a positive integer. For a ﬁxed value of t, the azimuthal
dependence of the density (14) along each circle of radius r within the source is the same as
that of a sinusoidal wave train with the wavelength 2πr/m whose m cycles ﬁt around the
circumference of the circle smoothly. As time elapses, this wave train both propagates around
each circle with the velocity rω and oscillates in its amplitude with the frequency Ω. This

12

is a generic source: One can construct any distribution with a uniformly rotating pattern,
Pr,ϕ,z(r, ˆϕ, z), by the superposition over m of terms of the form sr,ϕ,z(r, z, m) cos(m ˆϕ).

The electromagnetic ﬁelds

E = −∇PA0 −

, B = ∇P×A,

(16)

that arise from such a source are given, in the absence of boundaries, by the following classical
expression for the retarded four-potential:

Here, (xP, tP) = (rP, ϕP, zP, tP) and (x, t) = (r, ϕ, z, t) are the space-time coordinates of
the observation point and the source points, respectively, R stands for the magnitude of
R ≡ xP − x, and µ = 1, 2, 3 designate the spatial components, A and j, of Aµ and jµ in a
Cartesian coordinate system.1

In Ref. 10, we ﬁrst calculated the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld that arises from a circularly mov-
ing point source (representing a volume element of an extended source) with a superluminal
speed rω > c, i.e. considered a generalization of the synchrotron radiation to the superlumi-
nal regime. We then evaluated the integral representing the retarded ﬁeld (rather than the
retarded potential) of the extended source (14) by superposing the ﬁelds generated by the
constituent volume elements of this source, i.e. by using the generalization of the synchrotron
ﬁeld as the Green’s function for the problem (see also Ref. 12). In the superluminal regime,
this Green’s function has extended singularities, singularities that arise from the constructive
intereference of the emitted waves on the envelope of wave fronts and its cusp.

Labeling each element of the extended source (14) by its Lagrangian coordinate ˆϕ and
performing the integration with respect to t and ˆϕ (or equivalently ϕ and ˆϕ) in the multiple
integral implied by Eqs. (14)–(17), we showed in Ref. 10 that the resulting expression for the
radiation ﬁeld B (or E) consists of two parts: a part whose magnitude decays spherically, as
R−1
P , with the distance RP from the source (as in any other conventional radiation ﬁeld), and

represents a snapshot at a ﬁxed value of the observation time tP. The cusp
curve of the bifurcation surface of an observer P shown in Fig. 3 has precisely
the same shape, except that it resides in the space of source points, instead
of the space of observation points, and spirals in the clockwise direction: It
touches the light cylinder tangentially at the point (ˆr = 1, ϕ = ϕP + 3π/2,

source that lies close to the cusp in ∆ > 0 contributes to the nonspherically
decaying radiation. The source elements whose (ˆr, ˆz) coordinates fall in ∆ < 0
approach the observer with a speed dR/dt < c at the retarded time and so
make contributions toward the ﬁeld that are no diﬀerent from those made
in the subluminal regime. The asymptotes of the hyperbola ∆ = 0 make
the angles arcsin(1/ˆrP) and π − arcsin(1/ˆrP) with the z axis, so that for an
observation point in the far zone (ˆrP ≫ 1) the projection of the cusp onto the
(ˆr, ˆz) plane is (as depicted in Fig. 2) eﬀectively parallel to the rotation axis.

[see Eq. (27)]. In other words, the phase function φ− is more peaked at its maximum, the
farther the observation point is from the source.

This property of the phase function φ− distinguishes the asymptotic analysis that will
be presented in the following section from those commonly encountered in radiation theory.
What turns out to play the role of a large parameter in this asymptotic expansion is distance
( ˆRP), not frequency (µ±ω).

3. Asymptotic analysis of the integral representing the ﬁeld for large distance

3.A. Transformation of the phase of the integrand into a canonical form

The ﬁrst step in the asymptotic analysis of the integral that appears in Eq. (18) is to
introduce a change of variable ξ = ξ(ˆr, ˆz) that replaces the original phase φ− of the integrand
by as simple a polynomial as possible. This transformation should be one-to-one and should
preserve the number and nature of the stationary points of the phase.15, 16 Since φ− has a
single isolated stationary point at ˆr = ˆrC(ˆz), it can be cast into a canonical form by means
of the following transformation:

φ−(ˆr, ˆz) = φC(ˆz) + 1

2a(ˆz)ξ2,

in which a is the coeﬃcient given in Eqs. (27) and (30).

The integral in Eq. (18) can thus be written as

in which

and α ≡ −µa/2. The stationary point ˆr = ˆrC and the boundary point ˆr = ˆrS respectively
map onto ξ = 0 and

ξ = ξS ≡ −[2a−1(φS − φC)]1/2

The upper limit of integration in Eq. (32) is determined by the image of the support of the
source density (s in uj) under the transformation (31).

The Jacobian ∂ˆr/∂ξ of the above transformation is indeterminate at ξ = 0. Its value at
this critical point has to be found by repeated diﬀerentiation of Eq. (31) with respect to ξ,

and the evaluation of the resulting relation (38) at ˆr = ˆrC with the aid of Eq. (27). This
procedure, which amounts to applying l’Hˆopital’s rule, yields ∂ˆr/∂ξ|ξ=0 = 1: a result that
could have been anticipated in light of the coincidence of transformation (31) with the Taylor
expansion of φ− about ˆr = ˆrC to within the leading order. Correspondingly, the amplitude
A(ξ) that appears in Eq. (33) has the value ˆrC(ˆr2
C − 1)−1uj|ˆr=ˆrC exp(−iµφC) at the critical
point C.

When the observer is located in the far ﬁeld ( ˆRP ≫ 1), the phase of the integrand on
the right-hand side of Eq. (32) is rapidly oscillating irrespective of how low the harmonic
numbers µ± (i.e. the radiation frequencies µ±ω) may be. The leading contribution to the
asymptotic value of integral (32) from the stationary point ξ = 0 can therefore be determined
by the method of stationary phase.15 However, in the limit ˆRP → ∞, ξS reduces to

ξS ≃ −3−1/2 cos4 θP csc5 θP ˆR−2
P ,

(39)

so that the stationary point ξ = 0 is separated from the boundary point ξ = ξS by an
interval of the order of ˆR−2
P only. To determine the extent of the interval in ˆr from which the
dominant contribution toward the value of the radiation ﬁeld arises, we therefore need to
employ a more powerful technique for the asymptotic analysis of integral (32), a technique
that is capable of handling the contributions from both ˆrC and ˆrS simultaneously.

3.B. Contours of steepest descent

The technique we shall employ for this purpose is the method of steepest descents.16 We
regard the variable of integration in

I(ˆz) ≡

dξ A(ξ, ˆz) exp(iαξ2)

(40)

ξ>

ξS

Z

as complex, i.e. write ξ = u + iv, and invoke Cauchy’s integral theorem to deform the
original path of integration into the contours of steepest descent that pass through each of
the critical points ξ = ξS, ξ = 0, and ξ = ξ>. Here, we have introduced the real variable ξ>(ˆz)
to designate the image of ˆr> under transformation (31), i.e. the boundary of the support of
the source term uj that appears in the amplitude A(ξ, ˆz). We shall only treat the case in
which µ (and hence α) is positive; I(ˆz) for negative µ can then be obtained by taking the
complex conjugate of the derived expression and replacing φC with −φC [see Eq. (33)].

The path of steepest descent through the stationary point C at which ξ = 0 is given,

that lies within ∆ > 0 (see Fig. 4). The contours C1, C2, and C3 are the paths
of steepest descent through the stationary point C and the lower and upper
boundaries of the integration domain, respectively.

for ˆRP ≫ 1. Here, we have obtained the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the

The function A|C2 that here enters the integrand can be determined only by inverting the
original transformation (31).

However, since the dominant contribution towards the asymptotic value of the above
integral for ˆRP ≫ 1 comes from the vicinity of the boundary point S, the required inversion
of transformation (31) needs to be carried out only to within the leading order in σ. The
Taylor expansions of φ±(ˆr, ˆz) about ˆr = ˆrS(ˆz) are of the forms

φ± = φS + ˆr−1

|ˆr − ˆrS| ≪ 1,

ˆRP ≫ 1.

(49)

Hence, inserting Eqs. (48) and (49) in Eq. (33), taking the limit ˆRP → ∞, and expressing ξ
in terms of σ, we ﬁnd that

Strictly speaking, we should excise the singularity of A at σ = 0 by means of an arc-shaped
contour. However, since this singularity is integrable and so has no associated residue, the
contribution from such a contour vanishes in the limit that its arc length tends to zero.
An alternative way of handling the removeable singularity at σ = 0, followed below, is to
introduce a change of integration variable. If we let σ = τ 2/α, then the integral in Eq. (45)
assumes the form

The asymptotic value of this integral for ˆRP ≫ 1 receives its dominant contribution from
χ = 0. Because the function A|C3 is regular, on the other hand, its value at χ = 0 can be
found by simply evaluating the expression in Eq. (33) at ˆr = ˆr>. The result, for ˆRP → ∞, is

3.C. Asymptotic value of the radiation ﬁeld

The integral in Eq. (32) equals the sum of the three contour integrals that appear in Eqs. (42),
(51) and (59); the contributions of the contours that connect C1 and C2, and C1 and C3, at
inﬁnity (see Fig. 5) are exponentially small compared to those of C1, C2 and C3 themselves.
On the other hand, the leading terms in the asymptotic values of the integrals over C2 and
C3 decrease (with increasing ˆRP) much faster than that of the integral over C1: The integrals
over C2 and C3, respectively, decay as ˆR−2
P ln ˆRP and ˆR−1
P , while the integral over C1 decays
as ˆR−1/2
[see Eqs. (42), (51), and (59)]. The leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the
P
radiation ﬁeld Bns for large ˆRP is therefore given, according to Eqs. (18), (32), and (42), by

in which µ± can also be negative (see the ﬁrst paragraph of Section 3.B).

This result agrees with that in Eq. (55) of Ref. 10. The two expressions diﬀer by a factor
of 2 because we have here included the additional contribution that arises from the source
elements in the (vanishingly small) interval ˆrS ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆrC. The integration with respect to
ˆr in Eq. (52) of Ref. 10 extends over ˆrC ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆr>, while that in Eq. (40) extends over
ˆrS ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆr>. The contribution from ˆrS ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆrC is given, according to Cauchy’s theorem,
by the contribution from the lower half of C1 plus the contribution from C2.

Even though the length of the interval ˆrS ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆrC vanishes as ˆR−2

P as ˆRP tends to inﬁnity
[see Eq. (39)], the contribution that arises from this interval towards the value of the ﬁeld

21

equals that which arises from ˆrC ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆr>, and is by a factor of order ˆR1/2
greater than
P
that which arises from the open interval ˆrC < ˆr ≤ ˆr>. Thus, the nonspherically decaying
component of the radiation ﬁeld that is observed at any given (xP, tP) arises from those
elements of the source, located at the intersection of the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface
with the volume of the source (Fig. 4), that occupy the vanishingly small radial interval

δˆr ≡ ˆrC − ˆrS ≃ 1

2 cos4 θP csc5 θP ˆR−2

P

(61)

adjacent to the cusp at ˆr = ˆrS ≃ csc θP [see Eqs. (24) and (25)].

The corresponding azimuthal extent of the source from which the contribution described
by Eq. (18) arises is given by the separation φ+ − φ− of the two sheets of the bifurcation
surface shown in Fig. 3 close to the cusp curve of this surface: The contribution of the source
elements outside the bifurcation surface is by a factor of the order of ˆR−1/2
smaller than
those of the elements close to the cusp inside this surface [see Eqs. (41) and (42) of Ref. 10].
Since φ+ − φ− ≃ (25/2/3)(csc θP)−3/2(ˆr − ˆrS)3/2 for |ˆr − ˆrS| ≪ 1 and ˆRP ≫ 1 [see Eq. (46)],
and the contributing interval in ˆr is of the order of ˆR−2
P [see Eq. (61)], it follows that the
contributing interval in ϕ is

P

δϕ ≡ (φ+ − φ−)ˆr=ˆrC ≃ 2

3 cot6 θP ˆR−3
P .

(62)

The contribution from this vanishingly small azimuthal extent of the rotating source is made
when the retarded position of this part of the source is ϕ = ϕC [see Eq. (28)], i.e. when
the contributing source elements approach the observer with the speed of light and zero
acceleration along the radiation direction. Thus, the source that generates the nonspherically
decaying ﬁeld observed at a point ( ˆRP, θP, ϕP) in the far zone ( ˆRP ≫ 1) consists entirely of the
narrow ﬁlament parallel to the z axis that occupies a radial interval δˆr ∝ ˆR−2
P encompassing
ˆr ≃ csc θP and an azimuthal interval δϕ ∝ ˆR−3
P encompassing ϕ ≃ ϕP + 3π/2 at the retarded
time.

3.D. Frequency independence of the nonspherical decay

A further implication of the above analysis is that the generated ﬁeld decays nonspherically
irrespective of what the values of the frequencies µ±ω may be. There is no approximation
involved in introducing the transformation (31), and the asymptotic expansion is for large α.
As derived here, therefore, the only condition for the validity of Eq. (60) is that the absolute
2µ± ˆRP sin4 θP sec2 θP should be large, a condition that is automatically satisﬁed
value of α ≃ 1
in the far zone for all nonzero frequencies.

That the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the integral in Eq. (32) is pro-
portional to ˆR−1/2
P , is a consequence of the particular features of the phase
function φ− described by Eqs. (26)–(30). These features originate in and reﬂect the particu-
lar properties of the time-domain phase t + R(t)/c; they are totally independent of both the

, instead of ˆR−1

P

22

wavelength of the radiation and the size of the source. In contrast to all other nonspheri-
cally decaying solutions of Maxwell’s equations reported in the published literature (see, e.g.,
Refs. 17–19), whose slow spreading and decay only occur within the Fresnel distance from
the source, the nonspherical decay that is discussed here remains in force at all distances. In
fact, the greater the distance RP from the source, the more the leading term dominates the
asymptotic approximation in Eq. (60).

The remaining ˆz integration in the above expression for Bns amounts to a Fourier decom-
position of the source densities sr,ϕ,z|C with respect to ˆz. Using Eqs. (26)–(29) to replace φC
in Eq. (60) by its far-ﬁeld value

φC ≃ ˆRP − ˆz cos θP + 3π/2,

(63)

(64)

(65)

and using Eq. (23) to write out uj in terms of sr,ϕ,z, we ﬁnd that the electric ﬁeld Ens = ˆn×Bns

(outside the plane of rotation) the cusp curve of whose bifurcation surface (Fig. 3) intersects
the source distribution (Fig. 4).

3.E. Relevance to computational models of the emission from superluminal sources

The asymptotic analysis outlined in this section provides a basis also for the computational
treatment of the nonspherically decaying ﬁeld Bns. The original formulation of Bns appearing
in Eq. (18), in which the integral has a rapidly oscillating kernel, is not suitable for computing
a ﬁeld whose value in the radiation zone receives its main contribution from such small
fractions of the ˆr and ˆϕ integration domains as δˆr ∝ ˆR−2
P . The above
conversion of the Fourier-type integrals to Laplace-type integrals renders the selecting out
and handling of the contributions from integrands with such narrow supports numerically
more feasible.

4. The collection of nondiﬀracting subbeams delineating the overall distribution

of the nonspherically decaying radiation

We have seen that the wave fronts that emanate from a given volume element of a rotating
superluminal source possess an envelope consisting of two sheets that meet along a cusp
(Fig. 1). There is a higher-order focusing involved in the generation of the cusp than in that
of the envelope itself, so that the intensity of the radiation from an extended source attains
its maximum on the bundle of cusps that are emitted by various source elements. If a source
element approaches an observeration point P with the speed of light and zero acceleration
along the radiation direction, then the cusp it generates passes through P. The reason is that
both the locus of source elements that approach the observer with the speed of light and
zero acceleration [i.e. the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface (Fig. 3)] and the cusp that is
generated by a given source element are described by the same equation: The cusp curve of
the bifurcation surface resides in the space of source points and so is given by Eq. (11) for
a ﬁxed (ˆrP, ϕP, ˆzP), while the cusp curve of the envelope resides in the space of observation
points and is given by Eq. (11) for a ﬁxed (r, ϕ, z).

4.A. Angular extent of the nonspherically decaying emission

The collection of cusp curves that are generated by the constituent volume elements of an
extended source thus deﬁnes what might loosely be termed a ‘radiation beam’, although its
characteristics are distinct from those of conventionally produced beams. The ﬁeld decays
nonspherically only along the bundle of cusp curves embodying this radiation beam. Since
the cusp that is generated by a source element with the radial coordinate ˆr lies on the cone
θP = arcsin(1/ˆr) in the far zone, the nonspherically decaying radiation that arises from a
source distribution with the radial extent ˆr< ≤ ˆr ≤ ˆr> is detectable only within the conical
shell arcsin(1/ˆr>) ≤ θP ≤ arcsin(1/ˆr<).

The ﬁeld that is detected at a given point P within this conical shell arises almost exclu-
sively from a ﬁlamentary part of the source parallel to the z axis whose radial and azimuthal
extents are of the order of δˆr ∝ ˆR−2
P , respectively [see Eqs. (61) and (62)].
The bundle of cusps emanating from this narrow ﬁlament occupies a much smaller solid
angle than that described above. The parametric equation ˆzP = ˆzP(ˆrP), ϕP = ϕP(ˆrP) of the
particular cusp curve that emanates from a given source element (r, ˆϕ, z) can be written,
using Eq. (11), as

P and δϕ ∝ ˆR−3

ˆzP = ˆz ± (ˆr2

P − 1)1/2(ˆr2 − 1)1/2,

ϕP = ϕ − 2π + arccos[1/(ˆrˆrP)].

(66)

(67)

If we rewrite Eqs. (66) and (67) in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinates (RP, θP, ϕP)
of the observation point P and solve them for θP and ϕP as functions of (r, z) and RP, we

24

ﬁnd that the cusp that is generated by a source point with the coordinates (r, ˆϕ, z) passes
through the following two points on a sphere of radius RP:

where the ± correspond to the two halves of this cusp curve above and below the plane of
rotation (see Fig. 4).

The Taylor expansion of the expressions on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (68) and (69) in

P ± 1

ϕP = ϕ − 3π/2 − ˆR−1

These show that incremental changes δr and δϕ in the position of the source element (r, ˆϕ, z)
result in the following changes in the (θP, ϕP) coordinates of the point at which the cusp
arising from that element intersects a sphere of radius RP in the far zone:

δθP = −ˆr−1(ˆr2 − 1)−1/2δˆr − ˆr−1δˆz ˆR−1

P + · · · ,

and δϕP = δϕ + · · ·. Because δˆr is of the order of ˆR−2
P , while δˆz is of the order of unity for
the ﬁlamentary source of the ﬁeld that is detected at P, the dominant term in the expression
on the right-hand side of Eq. (72) is that proportional to the ˆz extent of the ﬁlament. Given
the observation point P, and hence a set of ﬁxed values for the dimensions (δˆr, δϕ, δˆz) of
the ﬁlamentary source of the ﬁeld that is detected at P, it therefore follows that the bundle
of cusps generated by such a ﬁlament occupies a solid angle with the dimensions

δθP ≃ −δˆz sin θP ˆR−1
P

and δϕP ≃ δϕ

(73)

in the far zone. [Here, we have made use of the fact that θP ≃ arcsin(1/ˆr) to within the
zeroth order in ˆR−1

P to express ˆr in Eq. (73) in terms of θP.]

The bundle of cusp curves occupying the solid angle (73) embodies a subbeam that does
not diverge in the direction of θP. The polar width δθP of this subbeam decreases with the
distance ˆRP in such a way that the thickness ˆRPδθP of the subbeam in the polar direction
remains constant: It equals the projection of the ˆz extent, δˆz, of the contributing ﬁlamentary
source onto a direction normal to the line of sight at all ˆRP. The azimuthal width of the

25

subbeam, on the other hand, diverges as does any other radiation beam: δϕP is independent
of ˆRP (see Fig. 2).

Thus, the bundle of cusps that emanates from the ﬁlamentary locus of the set of source
elements responsible for the nonspherically decaying ﬁeld at P intersects a large sphere of
radius RP (enclosing the source) along a strip the thickness of whose narrow side is inde-
pendent of RP. According to Eq. (73), the area R2
P sin θPδθPδϕP subtended by this subbeam
increases as RP, rather than R2
P, with the radius of the sphere enclosing the source. Conser-
vation of energy demands, therefore, that the Poynting vector associated with this radiation
P instead of R−2
should correspondingly decrease as R−1
P , in order that the ﬂux of energy re-
main the same across various cross sections of the subbeam. This requirement is, of course,
automatically met by the (nonspherical) rate of decay of the intensity of the radiation that
propagates along the subbeam.

The nondiﬀracting subbeams that are detected at two distinct observation points within
the solid angle arcsin(1/ˆr>) ≤ θP ≤ arcsin(1/ˆr<) arise from two distinct ﬁlamentary parts of
the source with essentially no common elements [see Eqs. (61) and (62)]. The subbeam that
passes through an observation point P′, though sharing the same general properties as that
which passes through P, arises from those elements of the source, located at ˆr′ = csc θP′,
ϕ′ = ϕP′, that approach P′, rather than P, with the speed of light and zero acceleration at
the retarded time. Not only are the focused wave packets that embody the cusp constantly
dispersed and reconstructed out of other (spherically spreading) waves,9 but also the ﬁla-
ments that act as sources of these focused waves each occupy a vanishingly small (∼ ˆR−5
P )
disjoint volume of the overall source distribution, and so are essentially independent of one
another. Unlike conventional radiation beams, which have ﬁxed sources, the subbeam that
passes through an observation point P arises from a source whose location and extent depend
on P.

It would be possible to identify the individual nondiﬀracting subbeams only in the case
of a source whose length scale of spatial variations is comparable to ˆR−2
P (e.g. in the case
of a turbulent plasma with a superluminally rotating macroscopic distribution). The overall
beam within which the nonspherically decaying radiation is detectable would then consist
of an incoherent superposition of coherent, nondiﬀracting subbeams with widely diﬀering
amplitudes and phases. The individual coherent subbeams decay nonspherically, but the
incoherence of their phase relationships ensures that the integrated ﬂux of energy associ-
ated with their superposition across this ﬁnite solid angle remains independent of RP. Note
that the individual subbeams constituting the overall beam would be narrower and more
distinguishable, the farther the observer is from the source.

5. Concluding remarks

The analysis we have presented here was motivated by questions encountered in the course of
the design, construction, and testing of practical machines for investigating the emission from
superluminal sources.6 The original mathematical treatment of the nonspherically decaying
radiation,10 in which the integral over the volume of the source has a rapidly oscillating kernel,
is not suitable for the computational modeling of the emission from such machines. We have
seen that the nonspherically decaying radiation detected in the radiation zone receives its
main contribution from such small fractions of the radial and azimuthal integration domains
as δˆr ∼ ˆR−2
P . The above conversion of the Fourier-type integrals to Laplace-
type integrals renders the selecting out and handling of the contributions from integrands
with such narrow supports numerically more feasible.

P and δϕ ∼ ˆR−3

Not only the nonspherical decay of its intensity, but also the narrowness of both the beam
into which it propagates and the region of the source from which it arises are features that are
unique to the emission from a rotating superluminal source. These features are not shared by
any other known emission mechanism. On the other hand, they are remarkably similar to the
observed features of an emission that has long been known to radio astronomers: to the (as
yet unexplained) extreme properties of the giant pulses that are received from pulsars (see,
e.g. Refs. 20–24). The giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar have a temporal structure of
the order of a nanosecond.22 Under the assumption that they decay spherically like other
conventional emissions, the observed values of these pulses’ ﬂuxes imply that their energy
densities generally exceed the energy densities of both the magnetic ﬁeld and the plasma
in the magnetosphere of a pulsar by many orders of magnitude.23 “The plasma structures
responsible for these emissions must be smaller than one metre in size, making them by far
the smallest objects ever detected and resolved outside the Solar System, and the brightest
transient radio sources in the sky.”22

The highly stable periodicity of the mean proﬁles of the observed pulses,20 i.e. the rigidly
rotating distribution of the radiation from pulsars, can only arise from a source whose dis-
tribution pattern correspondingly rotates rigidly, a source whose average density depends on
the azimuthal angle ϕ in the combination ϕ − ωt only: Maxwell’s equations demand that
the charge and current densities that give rise to this radiation should have exactly the
same symmetry (∂/∂t = −ω∂/∂ϕ) as that of the observed radiation ﬁelds E and B. On the
other hand, the domain of applicability of such a symmetry casnnot be localized; a solution
of Maxwell’s equations that satisﬁes this symmetry applies either to the entire magneto-
sphere or to a region whose boundary is an expanding wave front. Unless there is no plasma
outside the light cylinder, therefore, the macroscopic distribution of electric current in the
magnetosphere of a pulsar should have a superlumially rotating pattern in r > c/ω. The
superluminal source described by Eq. (14) captures the essential features of the macroscopic

27

charge-current distribution that is present in the magnetosphere of a pulsar and is thus an
inevitable implication of the observational data on these objects.

Once it is acknowledged that the source of the observed giant pulses should have a super-
luminally rotating distribution pattern, the extreme values of their brightness temperature
(∼ 1039 ◦K), temporal width (∼ 1 ns), and source dimension (∼ 1 m) are all explained by
the results of the above analysis. The nonspherical decay of the resulting radiation would
imply that the energy density and so the brightness temperature of the observed pulses are
by a factor of the order of ˆR/(ˆr> − ˆr<)2 smaller than those that are normally estimated by
using an inverse-square law,10 a factor that ranges from 1015 to 1025 in the case of known
pulsars.20

The nondiﬀracting nature of this nonspherically decaying radiation [Eq. (73)], together
with its arising only from the ﬁlamentary part of the source that approaches the observer
with the speed of light and zero acceleration [Eqs. (61) and (62)], likewise explain the values
of its temporal width and source dimension. Furthermore, that the overall beam within
which the nonspherically decaying radiation is detectable should in general consist of an
incoherent superposition of coherent, nondiﬀracting subbeams (Section 4) is consistent with
the conclusion reached by Popov et al.24 that “the radio emission of the Crab pulsar at the
longitudes of the main pulse and interpulse consists entirely of giant pulses.”24

Two other features of the emission from a rotating superluminal source that were derived
elsewhere25, 26 are also consistent with the observational data on pulsars:20 the occurrence of
concurrent ‘orthogonal’ polarization modes with swinging position angles25 and a broadband
frequency spectrum.26

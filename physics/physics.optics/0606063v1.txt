Abstract

It is found that the amphoteric refraction, i.e. the refraction can be either positive or negative

depending on the incident angles, could occur at a planar interface associated with a uniaxially

anisotropic positive index media (PIM) or an anisotropic negative index media (NIM). Particu-

larly, the anomalous negative refraction can occur at a planar interface from an isotropic PIM

to an anisotropic PIM, whereas the anomalous positive refraction occurs at the interface from an

isotropic PIM to an anisotropic NIM. The optimal conditions to yield the two unusual refractions

are obtained. The diﬀerence of the two types of amphoteric refraction is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The material with negative index of refraction, also known as left-handed media , ﬁrst

introduced by Veselago in 1968 [1], has recently received much more attention in literature.

Experimentally, an artiﬁcial composite media, meta-material, which has negative index of

refraction in the microwave regime, has been built and measured[2, 3]. Theoretically, the

perfect lens, which can realize sub-wavelength focusing, was ﬁrst proposed by Pendry [4].

Although some arguments have been evoked on the concepts of negative refractive index and

the perfect lens both[5, 6, 7, 8], the phenomenon of negative refraction has been examined

and conﬁrmed by many researchers [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

Negative refraction, in which the tangential component of the Poynting vector changes

sign when light refracted, is one of the dramatic properties of the left-handed media.

It

occurs at the interface between a normal positive index media (PIM), where the electric

permittivity ǫ and magnetic permeability µ are both positive, and a negative index media

(NIM), where ǫ and µ are both negative[1]. It was also found recently that negative refraction

can occur in some other media. Negative refraction in photonic crystal without negative

eﬀective index of refraction has been reported[16, 17]. Lindell et al [18] have shown that

negative refraction can occur at an interface associated with a uniaxially anisotropic media,

where only one of the four parameters of ǫ and µ tensors are negative. Recently, Zhang et

al [19] have demonstrated that an amphoteric refraction, i.e. the refraction can be either

positive or negative depending on the incident angles, may prevail at the interface between

two anisotropic PIM when their optical axes are in diﬀerent directions. Further, Liu et

al[20] have pointed out that the amphoteric refraction, as well as the omnidirectional total

transmission, can occur at a planar interfaces associated with a uniaxial media.

Here we investigate the amphoteric refraction characteristics of extraordinary light at

the planar interface associated with an anisotropic positive index media or an anisotropic

negative index media. It is found that the anomalous negative refraction can occur at a

planar interface from an isotropic PIM to an anisotropic PIM, while the anomalous positive

refraction occurs at the interface from an isotropic PIM to an anisotropic NIM. Relying on

dispersion equation, the optimal optical axis angle and the strongest anomalous refraction

angle are obtained. It is noted that for a strong anisotropy media, the maximum incident

angle yields the anomalous refraction could be very large. The diﬀerence of amphoteric

refraction associated with anisotropic PIM and with anisotropic NIM is also discussed.

II. AMPHOTERIC REFRACTION OF LIGHT

The negative refraction at an interface associated with uniaxially anisotropic media, where

some of the four parameters of ǫ and µ tensors are negative, has been generally discussed

[18, 21, 22]. However, in those literature, the optical axis of uniaxial NIM was assumed to

be normal or parallel to the interface. Here we assume that there is an angle ϕ between

the optical axis and the planar interface. It is the necessary condition for the amphoteric

refraction.

We consider the propagation of a planar wave of frequency ω as E = E0eik·r−iωt and
H = H0eik·r−iωt, through an isotropic PIM toward an uniaxially anisotropic media. For

the nonmagnetic isotropic PIM, the relative permittivity and permeability are both scalars,

i.e.

ǫI and µI. For the convenience and without loss of generality, we assume that the

permeability of uniaxially anisotropic media is isotropic, whereas the relative permittivity

is a second-rank tensor, given in principal coordinates as

We assume that ǫ⊥, ǫk > 0 and µ > 0 for the anisotropic PIM, and ǫ⊥, ǫk < 0 and µ < 0

for the anisotropic NIM, in which both ordinary and extraordinary indices are negative. As

shown in Fig.1, we also assume that all the wave vectors and the optical axis are in the x

z

planar, where the interface is the x

y plane at z = 0. The isotropic media is on the left

−

hand side of interface, while the anisotropic media on the right hand side. We refer to the

angle of the optical axis, ϕ, as the angle between the optical axis of anisotropic media and

the x direction.

When dealing with an extraordinary plane wave, polarized along x direction, one have

Ey = Hx = Hz = 0. The iso-frequency surface of the wave vector kt for transmitted

wave is an ellipse described by the dispersion relation. It is worth pointing out that for an

extraordinary wave the time-averaged Poynting vector for the transmitted wave St, which

deﬁnes the actual direction of the energy ﬂow of the extraordinary light, is normal to the

tangential surface of the wave vector ellipse at point kt.

The dispersion relation for extraordinary wave in uniaxial media can be easily obtained by

solving Maxwell’s equations for plane waves in the principal coordinates[23] with a rotation

is θi = tan−1(kix/kiz), and the refractive angle of the transmitted wave vector in anisotropic
media can be found by θr = tan−1(ktx/ktz). From the boundary conditions at the interface

z = 0, the tangential components of the wave vectors must be continuous, i.e. ktx = kix.

Due to the uniaxial anisotropy, the time-averaged Poynting vector St and the wave vector

kt are in diﬀerent directions. There is a bending angle between them. Because of the bending

angle, for some incident wave the negative refraction can occurs in anisotropic PIM, while

the positive refraction can occurs in anisotropic NIM.

At the interface, there are two conditions that the light refraction has to obey. The ﬁrst

is the continuous conditions of the tangential components of the wave vectors, i.e. ktx = kix.

The second is the energy conservation condition which requests the normal components Stz

and Siz must have the same sign. For the anisotropic PIM shown in Fig.1a, the normal

components Stz and ktz are always in the same sign, so we know that ktz and kiz have the

(4)

(5)

(6)

same sign too. It yields that the wave vector refraction is always positive. In this case, if

the tangential components Stx and ktx are in the opposite signs due to the bending angle, it

leads to a manifestation of the negative refraction. It is noted that the negative refraction

only occurs in a narrow range of incident angles.

It is contrary in the anisotropic NIM as shown in Fig.1b. The normal components Stz and

ktz are in the opposite signs now, then ktz and kiz have the diﬀerent signs. So the wave vector

refraction is always negative. The positive refraction also occurs when Stx and ktx have the

same sign due to the bending angle. Therefore, the amphoteric refractions are determined

by whether the signs of Stx and ktx are same or opposite. Their physical essential is due to

the uniaxial anisotropic. For the isotropic media, the Poynting vector St is always parallel

or anti-parallel with the wave vector kt in PIM or NIM, respectively. The signs of tangential

components Stx and ktx are always same (positive refraction for PIM) or opposite (negative

refraction for NIM). There is no amphoteric refraction for isotropic media.

III. THE REALIZATION OF ANOMALOUS REFRACTIONS

As an example of amphoteric refraction in anisotropic PIM, the numerical results cal-

culated for a Y V O4 crystal, which has recently been proposed by Zhang et al in their

experiment[19], is shown in Fig.2a. The Y V O4 crystal is a nonmagnetic uniaxial crystal
with ǫ⊥ = n2

e = 5.06614 and µ = 1. For comparison, an anisotropic NIM

0 = 4.07103, ǫk = n2

is shown in Fig.2b, with parameters of ǫ⊥ =

4.07103, ǫk =

5.06614 and µ =

In Fig.2, the ray refractive angle βr and the wave-vector refractive angle θr are shown

as the solid and dashed curves, respectively. The negative refraction occurs when curves

fall in the second or fourth quadrant of the θi

βr plane. One can see in Fig.2a that

−

it is always positive refraction for the wave-vector refractive angle θr. Whereas for the

ray refraction angle βr, the incident angle can be divided into three regions: one negative

refraction (θi/βr < 0) and two positive refraction(θi/βr > 0). The negative refraction occurs

in the fourth quadrant of the θi

βr plane, i.e. 0

It is noted that the negative refraction occurs in the fourth quadrant for a Y V O4 crystal

because it is a positive uniaxial crystal, i.e. ǫ⊥ < ǫk. Negative refraction should occurs in

the second quadrant for a negative uniaxial crystal. However, The conditions for yielding

The particular incident angle θic is dependent on the optical axis angle ϕ, as well as the

at the interfaces between two isotopic PIMs, and no positive refraction between an isotropic

PIM and an isotropic NIM. The dependence of the particular incident angle

IV. THE STRONGEST ANOMALOUS REFRACTION

It is also worth noting the particular refractive angle βrc, which is the refraction angle of

light when the incident angle is zero or ktx = 0. It represents the strongest negative refraction

for anisotropic PIM or the strongest positive refraction for anisotropic NIM. This angle is

also the particular incident angle of anomalous refraction when the light propagates from

an anisotropic media toward an isotropic media. The phenomena of anomalous refraction

at the interface from an isotropic NIM toward an anisotropic PIM or PIM and its analysis

are similar. So does the anomalous refraction from an anisotropic media toward an isotropic

media.

i.e.

V. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Theoretical investigation above indicates that the amphoteric refraction can be observed

at a planar interface between an isotropic media and an anisotropic media. When certain

conditions are satisﬁed, the interface between an isotropic PIM and an anisotropic PIM

10

(or NIM) can exhibit negative (or positive) refraction. It is worth noting the anomalous

refraction phenomenon occurs only in a narrow range of incident angles for an anisotropic

PIM. Even for a very strongly anisotropy parameter, i.e. (√ǫkµ

An intriguing phenomenon associated with the negative refraction that has generated

considerable interest is partial focusing by an anisotropic NIM planar slab[24, 25]. With

the suitable arrangement of the optical axis and the appropriate selection of anisotropy

parameter of the anisotropic NIM, the optimal focusing for anisotropic NIM as lens structures

can be eﬀectively obtained. Obviously the anomalous positive refraction may impair or

weaken the focusing property. We do not expect that the negative refraction in an anisotropic

PIM may obtain the same results. However, we believe that some potential applications can

be derived based on the amphoteric refractive properties in anisotropic PIM or NIM. They

can, for example, be used to provide bending, angular dispersion, energy ﬁltering, and beam

collimating for optical devices.

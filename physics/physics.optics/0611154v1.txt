We propose a versatile optical ring lattice suitable for trapping cold and quantum degenerate
atomic samples at discrete angular positions. We demonstrate the realisation of intensity patterns
generated from Laguerre-Gauss (exp(iℓθ)) modes with diﬀerent ℓ indices. The ring lattice can have
either intensity maxima or minima, suitable for trapping in red or blue detuned light, and it can be
rotated by introducing a frequency shift between the Laguerre Gauss modes. The potential wells
can be joined to form a uniform ring trap, making it ideal for studying persistent currents and the
Mott insulator transition in a ring geometry.

Conﬁning ultracold atomic samples in optical lattices
allows the investigation of eﬀects conventionally associ-
ated with condensed matter physics within a pure and
controllable system. Optical lattices have been employed
to trap arrays of atoms [1] as well as Bose conden-
sates (BECs).
Important experiments include the in-
vestigation of the quantum phase transition from a su-
perﬂuid to a Mott insulator [2], and the realisation of
arrays of Josephson junctions [3]. Of particular inter-
est is the study of quasi 1D systems as quantum eﬀects
are strongest at low dimensionality. An eﬀective change
of mass and associated lensing have been observed in a
moving 1D lattice [4]. Various ring traps for quantum
degenerate gasses [5, 6] have been generated that are in
many ways equivalent to an inﬁnite 1D geometry. More
recently ring-shaped lattices have been proposed [7].

Optical beams at a frequency far detuned from the
atomic or molecular resonance are one of the fundamen-
tal tools for the manipulation of cold atoms and BECs
[8]. The spatial structure of the intensity distribution
creates an energy potential well to trap and hold the
target species, either in the high intensity region of red
detuned light, or in the low intensity region of blue de-
tuned light. Translation of the intensity distribution of
the beam can be used to impart a global motion to the
trapped atoms/molecules [9]. Arbitrary intensity pat-
terns can be generated using spatial light modulators
(SLMs) acting as reconﬁgurable diﬀractive optical com-
ponents, i.e. holograms. Most notably SLMs have been
employed to form holographic optical tweezers [10] where
a single laser beam is diﬀracted to form multiple foci,
trapping microscopic objects in complex 3D geometries
[11]. Very recently, SLMs have also been used to ma-
nipulate single atoms [12] and BECs [13]. However, the
nature of nematic liquid crystal devices means that most
SLMs are limited in their update rate to around 50 Hz,
and even those based on ferroelectric conﬁgurations are

limited to 1 kHz [13]. In this paper we establish a method
for creating both positive and negative optical potentials
that can be rotated around the beam axis at frequencies
ranging from a few mHz to 100’s of MHz – optical fer-
ris wheels for atoms or BECs. The barriers between the
individual potential wells can be controlled allowing the
Mott transition from a ring lattice to a uniform ring trap.

ROTATING RING LATTICE THEORY

Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams have an azimuthal phase
dependence exp(iℓθ). The center of these beams contains
a phase singularity (optical vortex) where intensity van-
ishes. By overlapping two co-propagating LG beams with
diﬀerent ℓ-values ℓ1 and ℓ2 = ℓ1 + δℓ, the beams interfere
constructively at
azimuthal positions, separated by
regions of destructive interference, leading to a transverse
intensity proﬁle comprising
bright or dark petals. An
δℓ
|
angular frequency shift of δω between the LG beams in-
troduces an angular petal rotation rate of δω/δℓ [14].

Although LG beams with non-zero p-indices (i.e. with
p + 1 intensity rings), will allow more freedom in the cre-
ation of exotic ring lattices, we conﬁne our discussion in
this paper to the p = 0 case as it already allows the sim-
ple, but highly adaptable, formation of both bright and
dark dynamic ring lattices. We furthermore assume that
the interfering LG beams have the same focal position
and beam waist w0 in order to guarantee stable propa-
gation. The scaled electric ﬁeld of an LG beam using a
laser power P at wavelength λ can be expressed as:

ROTATING RING LATTICE EXPERIMENT

≈

Precise laser frequency shifts can be produced by pass-
ing light through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). An
acoustic modulation of angular frequency ωRF applied
to a crystal produces a traveling Bragg grating, shifting
the frequency of the ﬁrst order diﬀracted beam by ωRF.
100 MHz,
Typically operating at around ωRF/(2π)
such modulators can be tuned over 10’s of MHz. Two
AOMs operating at ωRF1 and ωRF2 can produce light
ωRF2
beams diﬀering in angular frequency by ωRF1 −
which can range from 0 to 10’s of MHz. Our radio fre-
quency signal generators (Marconi 2019) are passively
highly stable, but to ensure long term relative stability
we synchronize their 10 MHz clocks. In order to eliminate
the slight angular shift produced by tuning the modula-
tor frequency, the experiment is conﬁgured in a double-
pass arrangement, thus doubling the frequency shift to
ωRF2). We note that alternatively, a
δω = 2(ωRF1 −
small frequency shift can be imposed onto a light beam
by passing circularly polarized light through a rotating
half wave plate [17], which due to an accumulated geo-
metric or Berry phase [18], shifts the frequency by twice
the rotation speed of the waveplate. This approach has
been employed in optical tweezers [19].

A Gaussian laser beam can be readily converted into
a Laguerre-Gaussian mode by diﬀraction from a forked
grating where the positive and negative ﬁrst order beams
In our experi-
correspond to opposite signs of ℓ [20].
ment the forked gratings are generated on a computer
addressed SLM (HoloEye). The mode purity of the
diﬀracted Laguerre-Gaussian beams is enhanced beyond
standard hologram design by incorporating a spatially
dependent modulation of the hologram blazing [21].

Figure 2 shows the experimental arrangement used to
create bright and dark rotating ring lattices. The Gaus-

sian beam from a helium-neon laser is divided and double
passed through two AOMs, leading to laser beams with
an angular frequency diﬀerence of δω. These beams are
expanded to the size of the SLM. For the bright lattice,
the SLM is programmed with an ℓ-forked diﬀraction grat-
ing and the two beams are aligned such that the positive
and negative diﬀracted ﬁrst-order, which have opposite
signs of ℓ, subsequently interfere to give an intensity pat-
tern rotating at angular frequency δω/(2ℓ).

For the dark lattice we need to overlap two appropriate
Laguerre beams with order ℓ1 and ℓ2. In our experiment
we generated the required ℓ1 and ℓ2 forked holograms on
diﬀerent parts of the same SLM, with each laser beam in-
cident on one of the areas and aligned so that the reﬂected
petalled dark
beams are recombined to form the
lattice. We note that alignment of the ℓ1 and ℓ2 beams
is comparatively uncritical as the true zero intensity at
the dark lattice sites results from optical vortices (a 2π
electric ﬁeld phase winding around the dark lattice site).
Visualization of a rotating lattice requires high speed
photography. Using shutter speeds down to 5 ns we have
observed the rotating intensity patterns for frequency
shifts of up to 10 ’s of MHz between the two interfer-
ing Laguerre-Gaussian modes. The petal patterns ro-
tate at the expected frequencies. In Fig. 3(a) and (b) we
show still images of the light and dark lattice respectively,
which agree well with theory.

equal intensity and the dark lattice from ℓ1 = 3, ℓ2 = 11 with
I2 ≈ pℓ2/ℓ1I1. As an illustration of a rotating lattice we have
made movies of the experiments e.g. (link ℓ1 = −ℓ2 = 10).

APPLICATIONS TO ATOM OPTICS

By subjecting cold atoms to the dark or bright ring
lattice described above, they can be trapped in the re-
sulting light potential.
In order to limit losses due to
photon scattering we assume a light beam far detuned
from the atomic resonance. The AC Stark potential U ,
and photon scattering rate S, are related to the light in-
tensity I, and detuning ∆ = ω

where Γ and IS denote the linewidth and saturation
intensity of the atomic transition, respectively. To il-
lustrate the experimental feasibility of our scheme we
use the two-level dipole potential approximation, this
could be extended to a higher-order multi-level atom
model [22]. We now consider the speciﬁc example of
the D2 transition of 87Rb atoms with Γ = 2π
6MHz,
λ = 780nm, IS = 16.3 W m−2. We assume a ring lattice
laser total power of 2 W, which is focussed to a beam
waist of w0 = 30 µm at 1064 nm for trapping in the bright
lattice and 660 nm for trapping in the dark lattice. For
a ring lattice with 10 potential wells this results in a
108 W m2 corresponding to a poten-
peak intensity of 5
tial well 65 µK deep for the bright (ℓ1 = 5 =
ℓ2) lattice
108 W m2 corresponding to 15 µK for the dark
and 0.8
(ℓ1 = 5, ℓ2 = 15) lattices respectively. The coldest atoms
trapped in the high intensity regions of the red detuned
light potential will scatter a photon every 2 s. For the
blue detuned lattice the coldest atoms are trapped at
dark lattice sites and scattering will be negligible – even
the hottest atoms only scatter a photon every 6 s.

The optical lattice potential is suﬃcient to provide con-
ﬁnement in the transverse direction. To additionally lo-
calise atoms in the axial (z) direction we suggest a hy-
brid trap, combining the optical lattice with a quadrupole
magnetic trap [5, 23]. For the red lattice one could con-
sider all-optical conﬁnement in a tightly focused lattice
with a short Rayleigh range, but there is a trade-oﬀ be-
tween axial conﬁnement and scattering rate.
Instead,
atoms could be optically pumped into magnetic weak-
ﬁeld-seeking states and loaded into a quadrupole mag-
netic potential B = B1
. The centre of the
x/2, y/2,
quadrupole ﬁeld could be positioned away from the beam
focus to ensure a stable Gouy phase. However, for a stan-
dard quadrupole gradient of B1 = 100 G/cm, the atoms
will be conﬁned axially to a region much smaller than
the Rayleigh range and the twist of the Gouy phase be-
comes negligible.
In this hybrid magnetic and optical
trap one can use standard RF evaporation, allowing in-
situ cooling to quantum degeneracy. Circularly polarised
LG lattice beams are required to maintain the symmetry
between the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld and the light ﬁeld
and obtain a uniform ring lattice potential.

Alternatively, one can provide axial conﬁnement in a
ring lattice by using counterpropagating laser beams to
create a standing wave, generating an axially separated
stack of δℓ lattices similar to the method suggested in
[7]. However, by introducing a frequency shift between
the forward and backwards LG beam, the individual ring
lattices will not only rotate but also translate along the z-
axis at a speed ∆ωλ/(4π). Additionally, having a single
ring lattice rather than a stack of ring lattices simpliﬁes
the experiment and enables single-site addressability.

Our hybrid ring lattice enables the observation of the
Mott insulator transition in a geometry with periodic
boundary conditions. To adjust the barrier depth, and

hence the tunneling between sites, the relative power η1,2
in the ℓ1,2 beams can be varied. Experimentally, this can
easily be achieved by varying the modulation amplitude
of both AOMs while keeping the overall light intensity
constant. To make full use of all laser power, an electro-
optic modulator could be used to rotate the polarisa-
tion from the laser incident on a polarising beamsplitter
leading to the two AOMs. For the bright lattice η1,2
variation directly converts a uniform ring into a ring lat-
tice. Images from our optical experiment are shown in
Fig. 4(a)-(c) and the corresponding hybrid lattice the-
ory in Fig. 4(d)-(f). For the dark lattice, the transition
between uniform and multi-petalled ring is achieved by
gradually dimming the outer LG beam, and outer trans-
verse conﬁnement is then provided by the magnetic po-
tential (Fig. 4(g)-(i)).

and the boxes have xyz dimensions 120 × 120 × 80 µm3
(260 × 260 × 80 µm3).

The dynamic nature of our lattice could also be used
to initiate persistent currents.
In order to trap atoms
in a rotating well pattern, several conditions need to be
fulﬁlled: their initial temperature must be low enough
in order to be trapped, the rotation speed must change
slowly enough so that the atoms can adiabatically follow,
and the centrifugal acceleration must be small enough
for the radial potential gradient. This constraint is much
higher than the critical rotation rate for vortex creation
in 1D ωc = ~

0.1 rad/s for our parameters.

CONCLUSIONS

We have experimentally obtained both bright and dark
optical ring lattices, with tunable barriers between sites,
and with a tunable rotation rate. Furthermore we have
shown that, in combination with a magnetic trap, these
lattices will be ideal for studying quantum degenerate
gases. Future applications of the lattice include studies
of: persistent currents, rotation of a “quantum register,”
collisional studies using two counter-propagating rings.

We consider photonic tunnelling through evanescent regions and obtain general analytic expressions
for the transit (phase) time τ (in the opaque barrier limit) in order to study the recently proposed
“universality” property according to which τ is given by the reciprocal of the photon frequency. We
consider diﬀerent physical phenomena (corresponding to performed experiments) and show that such
a property is only an approximation. In particular we ﬁnd that the “correction” factor is a constant
term for total internal reﬂection and photonic bandgap, while it is frequency-dependent in the case
of undersized waveguide. The comparison of our predictions with the experimental results shows
quite a good agreement with observations and reveals the range of applicability of the approximated
“universality” property.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent times, some photonic experiments [1]- [4] deal-
ing with evanescent mode propagation have drawn some
attention because of their intriguing results. All such ex-
periments have measured the time required for the light
to travel through a region in which only evanescent prop-
agation occurs, according to classical Maxwell electrody-
namic. If certain conditions are fulﬁlled (i.e. in the limit
of opaque barriers), the obtained transit times are usually
shorter than the corresponding ones for real (not evanes-
cent) propagation through the same region. Due to the
experimental setups, this has been correctly interpreted
in terms of group velocities [5] greater than c inside the
considered region. Although there has been some confu-
sion in the scientiﬁc community, leading also to several
diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the transit time [6], these results
are not at odds with Einstein causality since, according
to Sommerfeld and Brillouin [7], the front velocity rather
than the group velocity is relevant for this. Waves which
are solutions of the Maxwell equations always travel in
vacuum with a front velocity equal to c while, in certain
conditions, their phase and group velocities can be diﬀer-
ent from c [8]. It is worthwhile to observe that the quoted
experiments are carried out studying diﬀerent phenom-
ena (undersized waveguide, photonic bandgap, total in-
ternal reﬂection) and exploring diﬀerent frequency ranges
(from optical to microwave region).
The interest in such experiments is driven by the fact that
evanescent mode propagation through a given region can
be viewed as a photonic tunnelling eﬀect through a “po-
tential” barrier in that region. This has been shown, for
example, in Ref. [9] using the formal analogy between the
(classical) Helmholtz wave equation and the (quantum

mechanical) Schr¨odinger equation (see also Ref. [10]). In
this respect, the photonic experiments are very useful
to study the question of tunnelling times, since experi-
ments involving charged particle (e.g. electrons) are not
yet sensible enough to measure transit times due to some
technical diﬃculties [11].
From an experimental point of view, the transit time τ
for a wave-packet propagating through a given region is
measured as the interval between the arrival times of the
signal envelope at the two ends of that region whose dis-
tance is D. In general, if the wave-packet has a group
velocity vg, this means that τ = D/vg. Since vg = dω/dk
(k wave-vector, ω angular frequency), then we can write
[12]:

,

(1)

τ =

dφ
dω
where dφ = D dk is the phase diﬀerence acquired by the
packet in the considered region. The above argument
works as well for matter particles in quantum mechanics,
changing the role of angular frequency and wave-vector
into the corresponding ones of energy and momentum
through the Planck - de Broglie relations.
However, diﬃculties arise when we deal with tunnelling
times, since inside a barrier region the wave-vector (or
the momentum) is imaginary, and hence no group veloc-
ity can be deﬁned. As a matter of fact, diﬀerent deﬁni-
tions of tunnelling time exist. While we refer the read to
the quoted literature [6], here we use the simple deﬁni-
tion of phase time which coincides with Eq. (1). In fact,
although vg seems meaningless in this case, nevertheless
Eq. (1) is meaningful also for evanescent propagation.
The adopted point of view takes advantage of the fact
that experimental results [1]- [4] seem to conﬁrm the def-
inition of phase time for the tunnelling transit time.

Recently, Haibel and Nimtz [4] have noted that, regard-
less of the diﬀerent phenomena studied, all experiments
have measured photonic tunnelling times which are ap-
proximately equal to the reciprocal of the frequency of
the radiation used in the given experiment. Such a “uni-
versal” behaviour is quite remarkable in view of the fact
that, although photonic barrier traversal takes place in
all the quoted experiments, nevertheless the boundary
conditions are peculiar of each experiment.
In the present paper we carefully study the proposed uni-
versality starting from a common feature of tunnelling
phenomena and, in the following section, derive a gen-
eral expression for the transit (phase) time. Diﬀerent ex-
periments manifest themselves into diﬀerent dispersion
relations for the barrier region. We then analyze each
peculiar experiment in Sects. III,IV,V and compare the-
oretical predictions with experimental observations. Fi-
nally, in Sect. VI, we discuss our results and give conclu-
sions.
Note that, diﬀerently from other possible analysis (see,
for example, the comparison with a photonic bandgap
experiment in [13]), we deal with only tunnelling times,
which have been directly observed, and not with veloci-
ties which, in the present case, are derived from transit
times.

In this paper we study one-dimensional problems or,
more in general, phenomena in which evanescent prop-
agation takes place along one direction, say z. Let us
then consider a particle or a wave-packet moving along
the z-axis entering in a region [0, a] with a potential bar-
rier V (z) or a refractive index n(z), as depicted in Figure
1. The energy/frequency of the incident particle/wave is
below the maximum of the potential or cutoﬀ frequency.
For all experiments we’ll consider, the barrier can be
modelled as a square one, in which V (z) or n(z) is con-
stant in regions I,II,III but diﬀerent from one region to
another. We also assume that V (z) or n(z) is equal in I
and II and take this value as the reference one.
The propagation of the particle/wave through the bar-
rier is described a by a scalar ﬁeld ψ representing the

2

Schr¨odinger wave function in the particle case or some
scalar component of the electric or magnetic ﬁeld in the
wave case. (The precise meaning of ψ in the case of wave
propagation depends on the particular phenomenon we
consider. However, the aim of this paper is to show that a
common background for all tunnelling phenomena exist).
Given the formal analogy between the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion and the Helmholtz equation [9], [10], this function
takes the following values in regions I,II,III, respectively:

−ikz
−χz + B eχz

ψI = eikz + R e
ψII = A e
ψIII = T eik(z−a)

,

(2)
(3)

(4)

where k and k2 = iχ are the wave-vectors (p = ¯hk is
the momentum) in regions I (or III) and II, respectively.
Note that we have suppressed the time dependent factor
eiωt. Obviously, the physical ﬁeld is represented by a
wave-packet with a given spectrum in ω:

ψ(z, t) =

dω η(ω) ei(kz−ωt)

.

(5)

Z

where η(ω) is the envelope function. Keeping this in
mind we use, however, for the sake of simplicity, the sim-
ple expressions in Eqs. (2), (3), (4). Furthermore, for the
moment, we disregard the explicit expression fro k and
χ in terms of the angular frequency ω (or the relation
between p and E = ¯hω). As well known, the coeﬃcients
R, T, A, B can be calculated from the matching condi-
tions at interfaces:

where the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to
z. Substituting Eqs. (2), (3), (4) into (6), (7) we are then
able to ﬁnd R, T, A, B and thus the explicit expression for
the function ψ. Here we focus only on the transmission
coeﬃcient T ; its expression is as follows:

The interesting limit is that of opaque barriers, in which
χa ≫ 1. All photonic tunnelling experiments have
mainly dealt with this case,
in which “superluminal”
propagation is predicted [14]. Taking this limit into Eq.

from the dispersion relations k = k(ω) and χ = χ(ω).

Note that while k1 and k2 are the real or imaginary wave-
vectors in regions I (or III) and II, v1 and v2 represent
the “real” or “imaginary” group velocities in the same
regions. Obviously, an imaginary group velocity (which
is the case for v2) has no physical meaning, but we stress
that in the physical expression for the time τ in (14) only
the ratio k2/v2 enters, which is a well-deﬁned real quan-
tity.
Equations (12) and (14) are very general ones (holding in
the limit of opaque barriers): they apply to all tunnelling
phenomena. It is nevertheless clear that peculiarities of a
given experiment enter in τ only through the dispersion
relations k = k(ω) and χ = χ(ω) or, better, k(ω)/χ(ω).
As an example of application of the obtained general
formula, we here consider the case of tunnelling of non
relativistic electrons with mass m through a potential
square barrier of height V0. (In the next sections we then
study in detail the three types of experiment already per-
formed). The electron energy is E = ¯hω (with E < V0)
while the momenta involved in the problem are p = ¯hk
and iq = ¯hk2 = i¯hχ. In this case, the dispersion relations
read as follows:

The ﬁrst photonic tunnelling phenomenon we consider is
that of frustrated total internal reﬂection [15]. This is
a two-dimensional process, but tunnelling proceeds only
in one direction. With reference to Figure 2, a light
beam impinges from a dielectric medium (typically a
prism) with index n1 onto a slab with index n2 < n1.
If the incident angle is greater than the critical value
θc = arcsin n2/n1, most of the beam is reﬂected while
part of it tunnels through the slab and emerges in the
second dielectric medium with index n1. Note that wave-
packets propagate along the x direction, while tunnelling
occurs in the z direction.
The wave-vectors k1, k2 in regions I (or III) and II satisfy:

where kx is the x component of k1 or k2 and k, χ are as
deﬁned in the previous section. The dispersion relations
in regions I (or III) and II are, respectively:

These equations also deﬁne the introduced quantities:

It is now very simple to obtain the tunnelling time in the
opaque barrier limit for this process; in fact, by substi-
tuting Eqs. (21)-(24) into Eq. (14) we ﬁnd:

This formula can be directly checked with experiments.
However, we ﬁrstly observe the interesting feature of this
expression which does satisfy the property pointed out
by Haibel and Nimtz [4]. In fact, the time τ in Eq. (29)
is just given, apart from a numerical factor depending on
the geometry and construction of the considered experi-
ment, by the reciprocal of the frequency of the radiation
used.
In a certain sense, the numerical factor can be
regarded as a “correction” factor to the “universality”
property of Haibel and Nimtz.
Several experiments measuring the tunnelling time in the
considered process have been performed [3].
In the experiment carried out by Balcon and Dutriaux [3],
two fused silica prisms with n1 = 1.403 and an air gap
(n2 = 1) are used. They employed a gaussian laser beam
of wave-length 3.39 µm with an incident angle θ = 45.5o.
Using these values into Eq. (29) we predict a tunnelling
time of 36.8 f s, to be compared with the experimental re-
sult of about 40 f s. As we can see, the agreement is good
and the “correction” factor in (29) is quite important for
this to occur (compare with the Haibel and Nimtz pre-
diction of 11.3 f s).
In the measurements by Mugnai, Ranfagni and Ronchi
[3], the microwave region is explored, with a signal whose
frequency is in the range 9 ÷ 10 GHz. They used two
paraﬃn prisms (n1 = 1.49) with an air gap (n2 = 1),
while the incidence angle is about 60o. For this exper-
iment we predict a tunnelling time of 87.2 ps, while the
experimental result is 87±7 ps ∗.
Finally, we consider the recent experiment performed
by Haibel and Nimtz [4] with a microwave radiation at
ν = 8.45 GHz and two perspex prisms (n1 = 1.605) sep-
arated by an air gap (n2 = 1). For an incident angle of
45o, from (29) we predict τ = 80.8 ps. The observed ex-
perimental result is, instead, 117±10 ps. In this case, the
agreement is not very good (while, dropping the “correc-
tion” factor, Haibel and Nimtz ﬁnd a better agreement);
probably this is due to the fact that the condition of
opaque barrier is not completely fulﬁlled.

∗

Note that the value of 134 ps used by Haibel and Nimtz
refers to the gap ﬁlled with paraﬃn. In this case no tunnelling
eﬀect is present. We observe that also for this experiment
the “correction” factor in (29) plays a crucial role for the
tunnelling times

IV. UNDERSIZED WAVEGUIDE

Let us now consider propagation through undersized rect-
angular waveguides as observed in [1]. Also in this
case, evanescent propagation proceeds along one direc-
tion (say z) and the results obtained in Sect.
II may
apply. With reference to Figure 3, a signal propagating
inside a “large” waveguide at a certain point undergoes
through a “smaller” waveguide for a given distance a. As
well known [16], the signal propagation inside a waveg-
uide is allowed only for frequencies higher than a typical
value (cutoﬀ frequency) depending on the geometry of
the waveguide. In the considered setup, the two diﬀer-
ently sized waveguides I (or III) and II have, then, diﬀer-
ent cutoﬀ frequencies (the ﬁrst one, ω1, is smaller than
the second one, ω2), and we consider the propagation of a
signal whose frequency (or range of frequencies) is larger
than ω1 but smaller than ω2: ω1 < ω < ω2. In such a
case, in the region 0 < z < a only evanescent propagation
is allowed and, thus, the undersized waveguide acts as a
barrier for the photonic signal. With the same notation
of Sect. II, the dispersion relations in the large and small
waveguide are, respectively:

By substituting this expression into Eq. (12), we imme-

(33)

On the contrary to what happens for tunnelling in to-
tal internal reﬂection setups, the coeﬃcient of the term
1/ν isn’t constant but depends itself on frequency. Thus,
in the case of undersized waveguides, the assumed “uni-
versality” property of Haibel and Nimtz cannot apply in
general; depending on the cutoﬀ frequencies, it is only
a partial approximate property for frequencies far way
from the cutoﬀ values (i.e. when the term in the square
root does not strongly depend on ν).
Let us now compare the prediction (33) with the ex-

experiment we have microwave radiation along waveg-
uides whose cutoﬀ frequencies are ν1 = 6.56 GHz and
ν2 = 9.49 GHz, respectively. The radiation frequencies
are around ν = 8.7 GHz, so that tunnelling phenom-
ena occur in the undersized waveguide. By substituting
these values into Eq. (33), we predict a tunnelling time
of 128 ps, confronting the observed time of about 130 ps.
As it is evident, also for an undersized waveguide setup
the theory matches quite well with experiments. Note
that, despite of the rich frequency dependence in Eq.
(33), the Haibel and Nimtz property also works quite
well (although some correction needs), since the central
frequency value of the radiation used in the experiment
is far enough from the cutoﬀ values.

V. PHOTONIC BANDGAP

The last phenomenon we consider is that of light prop-
agation through photonic bandgap materials. The ideal
setup is depicted in Figure 4. Light impinges on a succes-
sion of thin plane-parallel ﬁlms composed of N two-layer
unit cells of thicknesses d1, d2 and constant, real refrac-
tive indices n1, n2, embedded into a medium of index n0.
It is known [17] that such a multilayer dielectric mirror
possesses a (one-dimensional) “photonic bandgap”, that
is a range of frequencies corresponding to pure imaginary
values of the wave-vector. In practice, it is the optical
analog of crystalline solids possessing bandgaps. Increas-
ing the number of periods will result in an exponential
increase of the reﬂectivity, and thus the opaque barrier
condition can be fulﬁlled. In general, the study of elec-
tromagnetic properties of such materials is very compli-
cated, and the dispersion relation we need to evaluate the
phase time in the proposed formalism is quite involved
for physical situations. This study was performed ana-
lytically in [13] where the dispersion relation (and other
useful quantities) was derived starting from the complex
transmission coeﬃcient of the considered barrier. It is,
then, quite a meaningless issue to get the tunnelling time
from the dispersion relation obtained from the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient, while it is easier to have directly the
phase time τ from Eq. (1), where φ is the phase of the
complex transmission coeﬃcient. We consider only the
relevant case in which each layer is designed so that the
optical path is exactly 1/4 of some reference wave-length

λ0: n1d1 = n2d2 = λ0/4. In such a case, λ0 corresponds
to the midgap frequency ω0 (λ0 = 2πc/ω0). This condi-
tion is fulﬁlled in the considered experiments [2]. Finally,
we further assume normal incidence of the light on the
photonic bandgap material.
From [13] we then obtain the following expression for the
transmission coeﬃcient:

T = [(A C − B) + i A D]

Let us observe that, similarly to total internal reﬂection,
at midgap the time τ in Eq. (46) or (48) is again given
by the reciprocal of the frequency times a “correction”
constant factor.
We now analyze experimental results [2] in the light of
our theoretical speculations.
In the experiment performed by Steinberg, Kwiat and
Chiao, the authors used a quarter-wave multilayer di-
electric mirror with a (HL)5H structure with a total
thickness of d = 1.1µm attached on one side of a sub-
strate and immersed in air (n0 = 1). Here, H repre-
sents a titanium oxide ﬁlm with n1 = 2.22, while L is a
fused silica layer with n2 = 1.41. Thus, we have approxi-
mately N = 5+(1/2). As incident light, they employed a
wave-packet centred at a wave-length λ0 = 702nm, corre-
sponding to the midgap frequency ν0 of about 427GHz.
By substituting these numbers in our formula (48) we
predict a tunnelling time τ = 2.51 f s, corresponding to
a delay time ∆t, with respect to non tunnelling pho-
tons propagating at the speed of light the distance d, of
−1.09 f s. This has to be compared with the experimental
result of ∆t = −(1.47±0.2) f s. However, we point out
that our analytical prediction is aﬀected by two major
approximations. The ﬁrst one is, as already remarked,
that the experimental sample is not really a 5 + (1/2)
periodic structure. Since, in the considered case, the re-
maining “half-period” is made of high refractive index,
corresponding to a quarter-wave thickness d1 = λ0n1/4
smaller than d2 = λ0n2/4, a better approximation is
In this case
achieved by using Eq. (46) with N = 5.
we have τ = 2.42 f s or a delay time ∆t = −1.18 f s,
which is in better agreement with the experimental re-
sult. Furthermore, in our analysis (leading to Eq, (46) or
(48)) there is no room for considering the substrate on a
side of which the photonic bandgap material is attached.
Such an asymmetric structure cannot be taken into ac-
count in an analytic framework, but has to be studied us-
ing numerical matrix transfer method which would give
quite a good agreement with observations [13]. However,
this is beyond the aim of this paper, and we judge our
2σ prediction quite satisfactory.
Finally, we consider the experiment carried out by Spiel-
mann et al. [2] on alternated quarter-wave layers of fused
silica L and titanium dioxide H having the structure
of (substrate)(HL)n(air) with N = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. They
used optical pulses of frequency 375T Hz corresponding
to the midgap frequency of their photonic bandgap ma-
terial. Obviously, increasing N we have a better re-
alization of opaque barrier condition. From Eq.
(46)
with N = 11 (note, however, that for N ≥ 5 the factor

sinh(N − 1)θ/ sinh N θ is almost constant) we have a tun-
nelling time of 2.81 f s to be compared with the observed
value of 2.71 f s. We address the fact that, apart the pres-
ence of the substrate which introduces some approxima-
tion as discussed above, in the considered experiment the
incidence of the light on the sample is not normal, being
≈ 20o the angle between the axis of the sample and the
beam propagation direction. In this case, the described
computations are only approximated ones and, again, the
exact result can be obtained only through numerical im-
plementation. Nevertheless, also within the limits of our
calculations, the agreement between theory and experi-
ment is quite good.
A ﬁnal comment regards the predictions of the “univer-
sality” property proposed by Haibel and Nimtz. Neglect-
ing the “correction” factor in Eq. (46) would yield the
values of ∆t = −1.26 f s and τ = 2.67 f s for the de-
lay time in the Steinberg, Kwiat and Chiao experiment
and the transit time for the Spielmann et al. experi-
ment, respectively. In both cases, the agreement with the
observed values is better than our approximated predic-
tions, showing that the presence of the substrate (and the
non normal incidence in the second experiment) pushes
up the “correction” factor in Eq. (46).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have scrutinized the recently proposed
[4] “universality” property of the photonic tunnelling
time, according to which the barrier traversal time for
photons propagating through an evanescent region is ap-
proximately given by the reciprocal of the photonic fre-
quency, irrespective of the particular setup employed. To
this end, the transit time in the relevant region, deﬁned
here as in Eq. (1), needs to be computed for the diﬀerent
explored phenomena, and in Sect. II we have given gen-
eral expressions for this time in the opaque barrier limit.
The peculiarities of a given photonic setup enter in these
expression only through the dispersion relation relating
the wave-vector and the frequency. More in detail, we
have shown how the knowledge of the ratio between the
wave-vectors in the barrier region and outside it, as a
function of the photon frequency, is suﬃcient to evaluate
the transit time τ in Eq. (12).
Several speciﬁc cases, corresponding to the diﬀerent
classes of experimentally investigated phenomena, have
then been considered. In particular, in Sect. III we have
studied light propagation in a setup in which the evanes-
cent region is provided by total internal reﬂection, while
in Sect. IV the propagation through undersized waveg-
uides has been considered and, ﬁnally, in Sect. V the case
of a photonic bandgap has been analyzed. The relevant
results for the three mentioned phenomena are given in
Eqs. (29), (33) and (46), respectively. As can be easily
seen from these expressions, the frequency dependence
of the tunnelling time for the cases of total internal re-

ﬂection and photonic bandgap is just as predicted by the
property outlined by Haibel and Nimtz [4], although we
have derived a “correction” factor depending on the ge-
ometry and on the intrinsic properties of the sample (this
factor is not far from unity). On the contrary, such a
factor is frequency dependent for undersized waveguides,
revealing a more rich dependence of τ on ν than the sim-
ple 1/ν one (see Eq. (33)). We can then conclude that
the “universality” property of Haibel and Nimtz is only
an approximation, but it gives the right order of magni-
tude (and, in some case, even more) for the tunnelling
time. This conclusion holds also for undersized waveg-
uide propagation, provided that the photon frequency is
far enough from the cutoﬀ frequencies.
We have then calculated the tunnelling times for the dif-
ferent existing experiments and compared the theoretical
values with the observed ones. Results are summarized in
Table 1, where we also report the Haibel and Nimtz pre-
diction 1/ν. From these we can see that, in general, the
agreement of our prediction with the experimental values
is satisfactory. As pointed out in the previous section, the
calculations performed here for photonic bandgap mate-
rials assume some approximations in treating the com-
plex sample, which are nevertheless required to obtain
analytical expressions. Our prediction then suﬀer of this,
and the simple 1/ν rule ﬁts better with experiments. In
all other cases, the “correction” factor introduced in this
paper is quite relevant for the agreement with observa-
tions to be good.

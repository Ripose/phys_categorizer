Geometric interpretation of the 3-dimensional
coherence matrix for nonparaxial polarization

M R Dennis

H H Wills Physics Laboratory, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TL, UK

Abstract. The 3-dimensional coherence matrix is interpreted by emphasising its
invariance with respect to spatial rotations. Under these transformations, it naturally
decomposes into a real symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix, interpreted as the moment
of inertia of the ensemble (and the corresponding ellipsoid), and a real axial vector,
corresponding to the mean angular momentum of the ensemble. This vector and tensor
are related by several inequalities, and the interpretation is compared to those in which
unitary invariants of the coherence matrix are studied.

1. Introduction

2 hermitian
In the standard theory of partial polarization in paraxial light [1, 2], the 2
coherence matrix (with unit trace) is decomposed into components with respect to the
Pauli matrices. These components, the Stokes parameters, summarise the second order
statistical information about the ensemble; in particular, the sum of their squares is 1
for a pure polarization state, and 0 for a completely unpolarized ensemble.

×

There has recently been a revival of interest in the corresponding coherence matrix
in nonparaxial light, where in general there is no well-deﬁned propagation direction,
and the hermitian coherence matrix is 3
3 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In these treatments,
×
by analogy with the two-dimensional case, generalised Stokes parameters are deﬁned by
decomposing the coherence matrix with respect to the Gell-Mann matrices; a generalized
degree of polarization [3, 4, 5, 8, 9] may be deﬁned using the sum of squares of these
components.

Here, I propose a complementary interpretation of the 3

3 coherence matrix,
motivated by geometric reasoning. Rotational, rather than unitary, invariants of the
coherence are emphasised, and the matrix is found to decompose into its real part,
which is symmetric and interpreted geometrically as an ellipsoid, and its imaginary
part, which is antisymmetric and equivalent to an axial vector. The ellipsoid and vector
have natural interpretation in terms of the ensemble of polarization states, and are
related by certain inequalities to be described.

×

Pure states are represented by a complex vector E, representing the electric ﬁeld,
in either two or three dimensions. This is represented geometrically by an ellipse by

taking ReE exp(
iχ) and varying χ (this may represent time evolution) [6, 10, 11]; the
ellipse therefore has a sense of rotation. In two dimensions, this is taken in the natural
sense with respect to the plane, and polarization is either either right- or left-handed.
In three dimensions, the plane of the ellipse may vary, and the sense of rotation is
a direction normal to the ellipse, deﬁned in a right-handed sense with respect to the
ellipse rotation [10, 13]. The eccentricity of the ellipse can be 1 (corresponding to
linear polarization), 0 (corresponding to circular polarization), or any value in between.

polarization ellipses in the ensemble, adding incoherently.

The paper proceeds as follows: the following section is a review of conventional
two-dimensional coherence matrix theory; in section 3, the geometric decomposition of
the 3
3 coherence matrix is described; section 4 is devoted to the properties of the
coherence matrix, and section 5 to examples for certain ensembles. The paper concludes
with a discussion in section 6.

×

Polarization coherence matrices are special (classical) occurrences of density
matrices, perhaps more familiar in quantum mechanics [12, 14] (pure polarization states
corresponding to pure states, etc). Standard properties of density matrices (i.e. positive
deﬁnite matrices with unit trace) will be employed without proof.

the degree of polarization is unchanged when the ensemble is passed through a retarder,
or series of them.

The Stokes vector (2.3) resides in an abstract, 3-dimensional (Stokes) space, and the
representation of phase retarders by 3-dimensional rotations is correspondingly abstract.

For pure states, for which the Poincar´e sphere representation is useful, the Stokes

parameters provide geometric information about the polarization ellipse [6, 11]. S1 and
S2 inform about the alignment of the ellipse axes, the major axis making an angle
arg(S1 + iS2)/2 with the x-axis. S3 gives the ellipse area πS3, signed according to
polarization handedness, so S3 is zero for linear, and
1 for circular polarization.
Obviously, 2-dimensional rotations only aﬀect S1 and S2; the rotation giving (2.8)
represents aligning the major ellipse axis along x, the minor along y.

(Other authors, such as [3], use a diﬀerent set of generators.) The analogies between

the terms in the symmetric, oﬀ-diagonal part, Λ1, Λ4, Λ7, generalise S2; and Λ2, Λ5, Λ7,
appearing in the antisymmetric, imaginary part, S3. In particular, if Λ4, . . . , Λ7 = 0
and Λ8 = √3/8, then the remaining parameters are proportional to the usual Stokes
parameters. This motivates the deﬁnition of the generalised degree of polarization P3

It is physically and geometrically natural, however, to consider ρ3 under orthogonal
transformations rather than unitary ones; if viewed as passive rotations, this is simply
equivalent to redeﬁning cartesian axes in three dimensional space, and no physical
operation at all. Clearly, under rotation, where ρ becomes oρoT (o 3
3 orthogonal),
the real and imaginary parts of ρ transform independently of each other. The real part
is a positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix with ﬁve parameters Λ1, Λ3, Λ4, Λ6, Λ8. Since
the (unit) trace is also unaﬀected by rotation, it may be considered as distinct from
the rest of the real part. The imaginary part is a real antisymmetric matrix with three
Λ5, Λ2) transforms under rotation like
parameters Λ2, Λ5, Λ7, and in fact the triple (Λ7,
an axial vector (noted in [7]). ρ therefore decomposes into three parts: a real scalar (the
trace), a real axial vector, and a real traceless symmetric matrix. These diﬀerent parts
(scalar, vector, tensor) are called irreducible tensor operators in group theory; the same
decomposition occurs for density matrices of atoms with quantum spin 1, for which the
vector part is called the orientation, the tensor part the alignment [16].

From an analytical viewpoint, it is convenient to represent ρ using cartesian axes

as follows.

The real symmetric matrix M may be interpreted as the moment of inertia tensor of
the ensemble. Geometrically, it is the moment of inertia of the set of polarization ellipses
in the ensemble (taking each as an elliptical ring with uniform mass per unit length,
insensitive to the ellipse handedness). As with moment of inertia tensors in mechanics,
it may be represented in terms of its inertia ellipsoid, whose points (x1, x2, x3) satisfy

The ellipse axes are aligned in the 1,2,3 directions, with lengths √M1, √M2, √M3. If
M3 = 0, the ellipsoid is ﬂat (x3 = 0). In general, the inertia ellipsoid is speciﬁed by
6 parameters (the trace and Λ1, Λ3, Λ4, Λ6, Λ8); the diagonal form in (3.4), with three

parameters, reﬂects that three Euler angles have been used implicitly in the choice of
axes 1,2,3. The traceless part, dependent on the Λ parameters only, gives a measure of
departure of this inertia tensor from isotropy.

The vector N also has a simple interpretation as half the expectation value for

(spin) angular momentum in the ensemble,

S = tr(Sρ) = 2N ,

is therefore an average of the angular moemtnum, that is, the sense of rotation of the
ellipses, in the ensemble. Its direction, in general, has no relation to the principal axes of
M (although its maximum length is limited by them, as described in the next section).
The inertia tensor M and orientation vector N therefore provide information
about the real, three-dimensional geometry of the polarization ensemble, and they
rotate rigidly. Under more general unitary transformations (which have no physical
interpretation), the eigenvalues of M and components of N may change arbitrarily
(although keeping the unitary invariants tr ρ, tr ρ2 and det ρ ﬁxed).

As has been noted before [6, 9], ρ admits no decomposition into purely polarized
2 case (2.7). This fact will be discussed further in

and unpolarized parts, as in the 2
section 5.

In this section, various inequalities for M and N shall be found, using the fact that ρ
is a statistical density matrix.

nonnegativity of the determinant, which is stronger than inequalities constructed using

of the distance by which N fails to touch the dual ellipsoid with the dual ellipsoid
volume. This quantity, the trace, and the invariant discussed above are the only unitary
invariants of ρ. Unlike the 2-dimensional case, the properties of ρ are complicated by
the fact that polarization information is contained within both the inertia ellipsoid M
and the orientation vector N .

ellipse). If M1 = M2 = 1/2 in (5.1), the state is circularly polarized, and N3 =

It is easy to visualise ensembles which have N = 0:

their average angular
momentum is zero. This may be achieved, for instance, by requiring for every E in
the ensemble, E∗ has the same statistical weight as E. ρex1 is therefore the coherence
matrix for the ensemble consisting of the pair of states (with equal weight)

(√2, i, 0), (√2,

not the same:
the ellipses in the two ensembles have the same shape (eccentricity

transformation between the two sets of states.

The eigenvectors make up the ensemble, the probability weighting for each being the
corresponding eigenvalue. Since ρex1, ρex2 each have one zero eigenvalue, two states
alone are suﬃcient (the states in
ex2 are linear combinations of the eigenvectors,
and are not orthogonal). The 2-dimensional analogue to (5.6) is the origin of the
decomposition (2.7), and follows immediately. Since the decomposition in (5.6) is in
terms of three density matrices, a decomposition in terms of a single purely polarized
part and unpolarized part is, in general, impossible. The eigenvalues of ρ, being unitary
invariants, do not have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of the inertia ellipsoid
or orientation vector.

6. Discussion

Interfering nonparaxial polarization ﬁelds in three dimensions are more complicated
than their paraxial counterparts, and their analysis involves subtle geometric reasoning
[10, 18, 13, 11]. Most importantly, the Poincar´e sphere description breaks down for
polarization states in three dimensions, because it cannot account for the direction of
the ellipse normal N ; the appropriate nonparaxial analogue of the Poincar´e sphere is
the Majorana sphere, which involves the symmetric product of two unit vectors, which
describe the geometry of the nonparaxial polarization ellipse [19, 20, 18]. These two
vectors have a complicated expression in terms of the pure ﬁeld state E.

It would be of interest to ﬁnd the relationship between the 3

3 coherence matrix
and ensembles deﬁned in terms of the Majorana sphere; a natural physical case would
be when the Ex, Ey, Ez ﬁeld components are gaussian distributed (for example black
body radiation). In this case, for a given ρ the distribution on the Majorana sphere
would be unique and related to other gaussian Majorana statistics [21]. The analogous
2
2 distributions on the surface of the Poincar´e sphere have a rather simple form
[6, 22, 23, 24]. Given the analytical complications of the Majorana sphere, it is unlikely
that the 3
3 calculations will be straightforward, and it is unclear whether the geometric
interpretation presented here would be helpful in this problem.

×

×

×

Experimental situations in which the nonparaxial coherence matrix appears are
likely to be in the optical near ﬁeld, for which measurements of the 3-dimensional
ﬁeld are possible [25] (of course the theory is not restricted to optical frequencies). The
geometric interpretation should provide insight into the ensemble of polarization ellipses
which gives rise to a measured 3

3 coherence matrix.

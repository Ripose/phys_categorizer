The characteristics of an imaging system formed by a slab of a lossy left-handed material (LHM)
are studied. The transfer function of the LHM imaging system is written in an appropriate product
form with each term having a clear physical interpretation. A tiny loss of the LHM may suppress
the transmission of evanescent waves through the LHM slab and this is explained physically. An
analytical expression for the resolution of the imaging system is derived.
It is shown that it is
impossible to make a subwavelength imaging by using a realistic LHM imaging system unless the
LHM slab is much thinner than the wavelength.

INTRODUCTION

II. TRANSFER FUNCTION OF A LHM
IMAGING SYSTEM

Materials that have simultaneously a negative electric
permittivity and a negative magnetic permeability have
attracted much attention recently [1, 2, 3, 4]. These ma-
terials have extraordinary properties, such as the neg-
ative refraction,
inverse Doppler shift and backward-
directed Cherenkov radiation cone, etc [5]. The electric
ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld and the wave vector of an elec-
tromagnetic wave propagating in such a material obey
the left-hand rule and thus it is called the left-handed
material (LHM). Due to its eﬀect of the negative refrac-
tion, a LHM planar slab can act as a lens, and focusing
waves from a point source [5]. Recently, Pendry predicted
that a LHM slab can amplify evanescent waves and thus
behaves like a perfect lens [6].
It is well-known that a
conventional imaging system is limited in resolution by
the wavelength of the used light, since the information
ﬁner than the wavelength is carried by evanescent waves,
which are drastically decayed before they reach the im-
age plane. A LHM slab appears attractive in provideing
an eﬀective approach to achieve a subwavelength imag-
ing. However, the LHM that Pendry considered is quite
ideal and has no loss. Garcia et al [7] pointed out later
that an actual LHM should be lossy and the LHM loss
may completely suppress the ampliﬁcation of evanescent
waves, and consequently a LHM slab can not act as a
perfect lens. It is interesting to ﬁnd out answers to the
following questions: (1) What is the characteristic of a
realistic LHM imaging system? (2) How does the reso-
lution of the system depend on the LHM loss and other
slab parameters? (3) Is it possible to use a realistic LHM
imaging system to make a subwavelength imaging? If
yes, then how to realize it? In the present paper, we will
study these problems theoretically.

Consider a LHM slab imaging system with co-ordinates
as shown in Fig.
1. We assume that the system is
invariant along the y-axis direction and only the one-
dimensional imaging will be considered here for simplic-
ity. In the imaging system, the space can be divided into
three regions: region 1 (z < 0), where the objective plane
is located; region 2 (the LHM slab); region 3 (z
d),
where the image plane is located. The electric permit-
tivity and magnetic permeability in the three regions are
denoted by ǫl and µl (l = 1, 2, 3), respectively. Here
ǫ1 = ǫ3
0, Reǫ2 < 0, and Reµ2 < 0. This
imaging system has the properties of being linear and in-
variant under translation along the x direction, and thus
) or impulse
can be described by a transfer function (
response (h) (the latter is just the Fourier transform of
the former).

In order to calculate the transfer function of the LHM
imaging system, we consider a plane wave propagating
along the z direction from the objective plane z =
a
(a > 0). The plane wave will refract and reﬂect simulta-
neously at the interfaces z = 0 and z = d before it reaches
the image plane z = d + b (at a distance of b away from
the LHM slab). The electromagnetic ﬁelds can be de-
composed into the E- and H-polarization modes. Let’s
ﬁrst consider the E-polarization case, where the electric
ﬁeld has only y component (i.e., ~E = E ˆy), and the mag-
netic ﬁeld has the form of ~H = Hx ˆx + Hz ˆz. All the ﬁeld
components are assumed to have the time dependence of
form exp(
iωt). The electric ﬁeld E of the wave in the
three regions can be written in the following form of

Here t1 represents the eﬀective transmission coeﬃcient
for a plane wave at the interface z = 0 (i.e., t1 =

coeﬃcient at z = d (i.e., t2 = A3/(A2exp(
iqd))). ξ
is related to the impedance matching of the LHM with
1 when the impedance is
the surrounding medium (ξ =
matched). The second term (1+ξ)P 2 in the denominator
of expression (3.1) for t1 is attributed to the eﬀect of the
reﬂection of the wave at the interface z = d. In fact, this
term ((1 + ξ)P 2) vanishes if the LHM slab is completely
matched in the impedance with the medium in region 3
(i.e. ǫ2 =

or µ1 is. P is the phase change factor or amplitude am-
pliﬁcation factor as the wave passes the LHM slab, and
¯P is the total phase change factor or amplitude decaying
factor as the wave goes from the objective plane to the
left surface of the LHM slab and from the right surface
of the LHM slab to the image plane.

INFLUENCE OF THE LOSS IN THE LHM

It is known that an actual LHM should be lossy (i.e.
ǫ2 or µ2 has an imaginary part) since any LHM must be
dispersive [8]. Here we analyze the characteristics of the
transfer function for an imaging system formed by a lossy
LHM slab. Consider ﬁrst the case when the loss comes
only from the imaginary part of ǫ2, i.e.,

evanescent waves are very important for a subwavelength
imaging. For this case our analysis shows that ξ =
1 + (n1k0/kz)4δ2/8, which indicates that δ causes only
−
a second-order perturbation to ξ (the LHM slab seems
still well-matched with the surrounding media for these
0d)
evanescent waves). However,
increases exponentially as kx increases. Thus, unlike the
case of propagating waves, the second term (1 + ξ)P 2 in
the denominator of the expression (3.1) for t1 can not
be neglected. In other words, a tiny δ may cause a sig-
niﬁcant change of the eﬀective transmission coeﬃcient
t1 for the evanescent wave at the interface z = 0 (note
that δ causes only a small perturbation to t2 and P ),
and consequently leads to a quick decrease of
. For
a slab of usual medium (with or without loss), the ef-
fective transmission coeﬃcient t1 must be close to 1 if
the impedance is almost matched (regardless the value of
kx). However, for a LHM slab t1 can be very small (con-
sequently the total transmission coeﬃcient of the LHM
slab can be very small) even the the impedance is almost
matched. The main reason is that the evanescent wave
”reﬂected” at the back interface of the LHM slab may
be eﬀectively ampliﬁed (before it comes out of the slab)
and thus signiﬁcantly suppress the transmission of the
evanescent wave according to Eq. (3.1). Therefore, the
conventional concept of impedance match is insuﬃcient
to describe the medium match for evanescent waves for
a LHM slab. We introduce a critical value (kc
x) for kx,
1/2. Apparently, kc
x is closely related
at which Re
to the resolution of the imaging system. After a pertur-
bation analysis for Eqs. (2)-(3.5), one can conclude that
the critical value kc
x can be approximately determined
from the condition Re[(ξ + 1)P 2] = 2 (physically this
condition can be understood as a balance condition for
the two terms in the denominator of expression (3.1) for
x, the term (ξ + 1)P 2 becomes dom-
kc
t1). When kx

The value of kc

tem since kc

information can be correctly transferred by the system.

that γ =

magnitude. To realize the subwavelength imaging, e.g.,
10k0, it is required that δ < 10−52 when d = 2λ,
kx

10−25 when d = λ. It is doubtful whether
and δ < 2
the loss of a realistic LHM could be reduced to such a
level. Therefore, the thickness of the LHM slab should
be smaller than the wavelength in order to realize the
subwavelength imaging for such a system.

From Eq.

(2)-(3.5) (or Eq.

(8)) one can ﬁnd that
the characteristics of the transfer function (as well as
kc
x/(n1k0)) depend only on δ and d/λ. Fig. 3(a) gives
the contour plot of kc
x/(n1k0) (calculated with Eq. (2)) as
a function of δ and d/λ. From this ﬁgure one sees that
kc
x is very sensitive to the thickness d. Our numerical

calculation shows that the requirement for kc

d = λ, δ = 9
when d = λ/4. Fig. 3(b) shows kc

of the resolution (denoted by ∆) for an imaging system,

and imaginary parts of the impulse response (normalized
by h(0)) of a LHM imaging system, respectively, with
δ = 10−4 and d = λ. One sees that the imaginary part of
the impulse response is very small and can be neglected
as compared with the real part. From Fig. 4(a) one sees
that the real part of h calculated from the Fourier trans-
form of Eq.(2) (the solid line) agrees very well with that
from our analytic expression (the dotted line) in the re-
x (note that our analytic expression

very small, as show in Fig. 4(b)). This indicates that the

IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper we have analyzed the characteristics of
the transfer function for an imaging system formed by a
lossy LHM slab. The small loss in the LHM may com-
pletely change the transfer function in the following as-
pects: (1) the transfer function drops to zero abruptly
near the turning point kx = n1k0 for the propagating

4

H

H

x (at which

and evanescent waves; (2)
decreases to zero rapidly
when kx increases from a critical kc
= 1/2).
Our analysis shows that kc
x is almost linearly propor-
tional to the logarithm of the loss parameter δ (related
to the imaginary part of ǫ2 or µ2) of the LHM. Thus, kc
x
does not increase noticeably even if the loss decreases by
one order of magnitude. Analytical formulas for kc
x and
the resolution of the imaging system have been derived.
It has been shown that the thickness of the LHM slab
should be smaller than the wavelength in order to realize
the subwavelength imaging for such a system.

Our analysis has also shown that a tiny loss of the
LHM may suppress the transmission of evanescent waves
through the LHM slab due to the ampliﬁcation of the
evanescent waves in the LHM slab. Such a suppression
can be eﬀectively relaxed by reducing the thickness of
the LHM slab. We have also tried to eliminate or reduce
the destructive inﬂuence of the LHM loss to the imaging
resolution through manupilating the real and imaginary
parts of µ2 and ǫ2. However, we found this is not possible
(see the appendix).

to eﬀectively reduce the destructive inﬂuence of the LHM
loss to the subwavelength imaging by manupilating the
real and imaginary parts of µ2 and ǫ2.

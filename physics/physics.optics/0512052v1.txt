By numerically integrating the three-dimensional Maxwell equations in the time domain with reference to a
dispersive quadratically nonlinear material, we study second harmonic generation in planar photonic crystal
microresonators. The proposed scheme allows eﬃcient coupling of the pump radiation to the defect resonant
mode. The out-coupled generated second harmonic is maximized by impedance matching the photonic crystal
cavity to the output waveguide.

In the early sixties the very ﬁrst experiments in nonlin-
ear optics were Frankens investigations of traveling-wave
second harmonic generation.1 It took a number of years
to realize that guided-wave optics and resonators could
dramatically enhance phenomena requiring high inten-
sities and tuning of critical parameters.2–4 Since then,
both the advent of nano-optics and the technological ad-
vances have made new solutions available. Among them,
microresonators can certainly be considered among the
best candidates for nonlinear optics and frequency gen-
erations.5–8 In the past few years, photonic crystal (PC)
microcavities, i. e. periodic (bandgap) structures host-
ing a resonant defect, have attracted attention for some
of their unique properties.9, 10 In particular, in PC mi-
croresonators it is possible to obtain extremely high qual-
ity factors (Q) in reduced volumes while tailoring their
dispersive features,11, 12 characteristics which can be ex-
ploited to achieve eﬃcient frequency generation with var-
ious schemes.13–16 The advantages inherent to a high
conﬁnement, however, are partially counterbalanced by
a diﬃcult energy coupling into the resonators: well iso-
lated resonant states, in fact, correspond to large (exter-
nal) quality factors of the cavity.17

To this extent, impedance matching has been proposed
based on a properly designed coupling to/from the mi-
crocavities.18, 19 In this Letter we propose and investigate
an eﬃcient outsourcing scheme to maximize frequency
doubling from a PC defect. Resorting to a second-order
nonlinearity in a large Q photonic crystal microcavity,
an optical pump is up-converted to a resonant cross-
polarized harmonic signal. Since the device is designed
to be nearly transparent to the pump wavelength, input

coupling losses are minimized while the out-coupled sec-
ond harmonic can be maximized by impedance match-
ing.
The temporal evolution of the resonant mode at the
second-harmonic (SH) can be described and related to
the cavity parameters by coupled mode theory in the
time domain (CMT-TD):17

(FF) and SH frequencies, sF F is the amplitude of the
FF guided mode propagating through the cavity via
input and output waveguides. The latter amplitude
acts as a source for SH generation in the resonator. A
pictorial sketch of the PC microcavity with input and
output guides is shown in Fig. 1.

On the RHS of (4) τe and τo have been replaced by in-
ternal Qo and external Qe quality factors of the cavity,
respectively, being 1/Q = 2/(τ ωSH ). For a constant κ
in (4), the SHG eﬃciency is linearly dependent on Qo
and maximized when Qe/Qo = 1. Otherwise stated, once
the cavity geometry is deﬁned (i.e. given a certain Qo)
and for small changes in the overlap integral κ, the out-
coupled SH can be optimized by engineering the factor
Qe. In order to demonstrate the validity of the insight
above, we need to take into account all the loss mecha-
nisms (radiation, absorption and coupling), material and
PC dispersion and nonlinear response. To this extent
we employed a ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain (FDTD)

The last equation describes a dipole oscillation with an

persion with a Lorentzian distribution centered in ωR.

1 to mimic the response of GaAs.
The pertinent tensor D values were selected after a 45
degrees rotation in the plane ˆzy of GaAs crystallographic
axes. This permits to generate (quasi-) TE polarized
second harmonic when a linearly polarized (quasi-) TM
pump-mode is launched in the structure through the in-
put channel. We investigated a microcavity consisting of
a PC membrane with three concentric rings of holes with
a central defect to support a resonant state at SH. The
radius of the PC holes is r = 90nm and the lattice con-
stant a = 300nm. Two suspended channel waveguides
of width w = 1µm and thickness h = 500nm feed and
out-couple the radiation to and from the microcavity, re-
spectively. The separation d can be varied in order to ad-
just the SH impedance of the waveguide to the resonant
mode. For the sake of simplicity, we set the separation d
the same at both the input and the output. The structure
is designed to be resonant at λSH = 1.1370µm for the
TE polarization. The input waveguide couples a TM-

pumping with PF F = 1KW through the input channel.
Such value for PSH needs be linked to the small quality
factor Qo of the resonator (for computational reasons we
analyzed a rather small PC) and to the non-optimized
FF sourcing into the resonating mode at SH (i.e. a lim-
ited κ). Both factors could be enhanced by a proper de-
sign. In conclusion, we have numerically investigated by
FDTD second harmonic generation in a photonic crystal
microcavity, maximizing the out-coupled SH power by
a simple impedance matching based on the separation
between the PC and the output channel. We anticipate
that these results will promote design and realization of
eﬃcient integrated structures for all-optical signal han-
dling.

polarized SH mode of amplitude aSH and out-coupled
to the TE-mode sSH . As d was tuned, we veriﬁed that
the resonant frequency did not change appreciably. With
the FDTD code, ﬁrst we linearly characterized the defect
state. By evaluating the rate of energy decrease and the
transmission T at ωSH , T = (1 + Qe/Qo)2, we calculated
both Qo and Qe for various d, according to:

Fig. 2 displays the computed values: as expected, increas-
ing the distance d between the cavity and the waveg-
uide(s) barely aﬀects the internal (intrinsic) cavity losses,
although an apparent increase takes place in the exter-
nal quality factor owing to a lower coupling to and from
the resonator. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the calculated
ratio between Qe and Qo. On the basis of Eq. (4), the
SH eﬃciency is maximum when such ratio equals unity,
i.e. for values of d/r close to one (see inset). We numeri-
cally launched a TM-polarized cw-like excitation at ωF F
in the feeding waveguide. The top panel of Fig. 3 is a
snapshot of the TM component of the FF electric ﬁeld,
ﬂowing from left to right through the PC and its defect.
The TE-component of the generated electric ﬁeld at SH
is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3: the generated
mode at ωSH clearly resonates in the central portion of
the cavity. To evaluate the SHG eﬃciency we computed
the TE-polarized SH power in the output waveguide and
scaled it to the square power of the FF radiation propa-
gating through the PC. The results are displayed in Fig.
4, which shows an apparent maximum in eﬃciency when
the separation between waveguide(s) and PC cavity re-
alizes the impedance matching, e.g. for d/r = 1. Note-
worthy, at variance with the simple CMT-TD, the latter
ratio accounts for both the variations in κ and the ac-
tual FF power coupled in the structure. For this case, we
calculated an out-coupled SH-power PSH = 0.22W when

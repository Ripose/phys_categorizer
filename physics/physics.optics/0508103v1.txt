Abstract

The backscattering of circularly polarized light at normal incidence to a half-space of
scattering particles is studied using the Electric Field Monte Carlo (EMC) method. The
spatial distribution of the backscattered light intensity is examined for both the time-
resolved and continuous wave cases for large particles with anisotropy factor, g, in the
range 0.8 to 0.97. For the time-resolved case, the backscattered light with the same
helicity as that of the incident beam (co-polarized) is found to form a ring centered
on the point of incidence. The ring expands and simultaneously grows weak as time
increases. The intensity of backscattered light with helicity opposite to that of the incident
beam (cross-polarized) is found to exhibit a ring behavior for g ≥ 0.85, with signiﬁcant
backscattering at the point of incidence. For the continuous-wave case no such ring
pattern is observed in backscattered light for either helicity. The present EMC study
suggests that the ring behavior can only be observed in the time domain, in contrast to
previous studies of light backscattered from forward scattering media based on the scalar
time-independent Fokker-Planck approximation to the radiative transfer equation. The
time-dependent ring structure of backscattered light may have potential use in subsurface
imaging applications.

1 Introduction

Polarized light backscattered from highly scattering media carries medium-speciﬁc infor-
mation that can be utilized in polarization sensitive imaging techniques[1]-[4]. How light
depolarizes and propagates from and within a scattering medium remains an active topic
of research in optical imaging of targets embedded in highly scattering media. Polar-
ization sensitive imaging techniques depend on the level of anisotropy of the scattering
medium, which in turn depends on the relative size of scattering particle and wavelength
of light used. When the particle diameter, a, is small compared to the wavelength,
λ, of incident light, the transport mean free path, lt, becomes equal to the scattering
mean free path, ls, and isotropic scattering results. In isotropic scattering linearly po-
larized light has a longer depolarization length than circularly polarized light and tends
to backscatter with the same polarization as the input whereas circularly polarized light
backscatters with its helicity ﬂipped. This is attributed to single scattering events with

a ≥ λ
4 yielding lt > ls, circularly polarized light has a longer depolarization length than
linearly polarized light and backscatters with preserved helicity[5]. This process is termed
polarization memory[6]. In this case linearly polarized light is backscattered with some
elliptic polarization. This is attributed to forward scattering within the medium, causing
the polarization of linearly polarized light to become randomized over shorter distances
than the circularly polarized light.

The questions that need to be addressed include the following. Is light backscattered
primarily from the point of incidence? Does backscattered light take special pathways
inside the media towards the incident surface? Does the backscattered light exhibit
time-dependent features? These questions warrant study as it is strongly anisotropic
scattering in the forward direction that is encountered in biomedical optical imaging.
Such knowledge would give an indication of the scattering behavior of light as it travels
inside the scattering medium.

An analysis of the spatial dependence of backscattered circularly polarized beams was
ﬁrst carried out by Kim and Moscoso[7] who used the scalar time-independent Fokker-
Planck equation, an approximation to the radiative transfer equation. They predict a
time-independent circularly symmetric peak centered on the point of incidence, hence-
forth referred to as a “ring” or “ring-peak”, in the backscattered light and postulate that
light comprising the ring is of the same helicity as the circularly polarized incident beam.
In this study, the Electric Field Monte Carlo method[8] is used to investigate the
spatial distribution of time-dependent (time-resolved), in addition to steady state (con-
tinuous wave), properties of light backscattered when a pencil-like beam is incident on a
half-space of forward scattering particles whose anisotropy factors range from g = 0.8 to
g = 0.97. The EMC program uses the exact phase function of the individual scatterers
to allow for a more physical simulation of light propagation. The EMC simulation results
suggest that the backscattered light forms rings that can only be observed in the time
domain and can be seen in both the co-polarized and cross-polarized backscattered light
in the presence of forward-peaked scattering with g ≥ 0.85.

2 The Electric Field Monte Carlo Method

Polarized light propagation in turbid media, including human tissues[9], may be described
by the time-dependent vector radiative transfer equation (RTE)[10]:

(c−1

o ∂t + ˆs · ∇r + σt)I(~r, ˆs, t) =

Ω P(ˆs · ˆs′) · I(~r, ˆs′, t)ds′
R

(1)

Here I is the Stokes vector, deﬁned by I = (I , Q , U , V )T , where T denotes transpose.
The components of the Stokes vector are deﬁned in terms of the two orthogonal complex
electric ﬁeld components, E1,2, perpendicular to the direction of the incident light: I =
hE1E∗
2 − E2E∗
2i, U = hE1E∗
1 i.
hAi denotes time averaging of the quantity A, co is the speed of light in the medium, σt
is the total extinction cross section and Ω denotes the unit sphere. P denotes the 4 × 4
phase matrix.

1 i and V = i hE1E∗

2i, Q = hE1E∗

1 − E2E∗

1 + E2E∗

2 + E2E∗

Due to the current absence of analytical solutions to the RTE within a bounded
medium, numerical studies of polarized light propagation involving Monte Carlo sim-
ulation and numerical solutions to the RTE are often the most available tools to ex-
plore polarized light propagation in turbid media from a theoretical perspective. These
methods[8],[12] - [20] have been extensively used to characterize diﬀerent types of scat-
tering media such as particle suspensions, and biological materials.

The Electric Field Monte Carlo method (EMC) traces the multiply scattered electric
ﬁeld of incident light in time to simulate the time-resolved propagation of polarized light
in turbid media. At each step in time, the EMC program simulates light scattering, ab-
sorption, or unhindered propagation giving the scattered electric ﬁeld, E′(t). The parallel
and perpendicular components of the complex electric ﬁeld are updated with respect to
the instantaneous scattering plane by the amplitude scattering matrix and simultaneous
rotations of the local coordinate system spanned by the components of the electric ﬁeld
and the propagation direction. As described in reference[8], if m and n are unit vectors
in the directions of the parallel and perpendicular components of the electric ﬁeld with
respect to the previous scattering plane and s is the electric ﬁeld propagation direction
prior to the current scattering event then the propagation direction s′ of the electric ﬁeld
after the current scattering event is given by:

s′ = m sin(θ) cos(φ) + n sin(θ) sin(φ) + s cos(θ)

where θ is the scattering angle and φ is the azimuthal angle of the current scattering.
The current scattering plane is spanned by s and s′. The unit vectors in the direction
of the parallel and perpendicular electric ﬁeld components with respect to s and s′ are
given prior to scattering by:

e1 = m cos(φ) + n sin(φ)
e2 = −m sin(φ) + n cos(φ)

and after scattering are given by:

e′
1 = m cos(θ) cos(φ) + n cos(θ) sin(φ) − s sin(θ) = m′
2 = e2 = n′
e′

The local coordinate system (m, n, s) is rotated to (m′,n′,s′) with the components of

the incident electric ﬁeld, E = E1m + E2n, being updated correspondingly by:

E′ = E′

1m′ + E′

2n′ = (S2E · e1)m′ + (S1E · e2)n′

where S2(θ) and S1(θ) are the diagonal elements, respectively, of the amplitude scattering
matrix. The amplitude scattering matrix is diagonal as a result of the symmetry of the
spherical scatterers.

To summarize, the local coordinate system (m, n, s) is updated to (m′,n′,s′) by:

where the scattered wave intensity, F (θ, φ), into direction s′ (characterized by θ, φ) has
been introduced as a normalizing factor[8]. This normalization factor insures that the
scattered light intensity is conserved at each scattering event. Absorption of light is
accounted for by adjusting the weight of the scattered photons as in standard Monte
Calro simulations[21].

The coordinate system and electric ﬁeld are updated simulatneously at each scatter-
ing event deﬁned by the sampling of θ, φ from the normalized phase function p(θ, φ) =
F (θ, φ)/πQsca(ka)2 where Qsca is the scattering eﬃciency, k is the wave vector of inci-
dent light on a spherical particle and a is the radius of the particle. To sample θ and
φ the phase function of the particles is determined numerically at the beginning of the
calculation.

After n consecutive scattering events the state of a photon is given by the local
coordinate system (m(n),n(n),s(n)), the complex electric ﬁeld components E(n)
1,2 , the op-
tical path length l (distance travelled by photon in the medium) and weight, w.
Ini-
tially unity at incidence, the weight is multiplied by the albedo of the scatterer at
each scattering event. Once the photon hits the detector the electric ﬁeld at the de-
tector, Ed, and Stokes vector, I, is increased according to the detected light increment:
w1/2Ed = w1/2(E(n)

2 n(n))exp(2πil/λ) [8].

3 Results

A collimated beam, Nδ(t)δ(~r), where N = 2 × 1011 circularly polarized photons, is nor-
mally incident on a slab of scatterers of length 25[ls]. Mie calculations were used to
determine g, ls, lt and the phase function p(ˆs · ˆs′) prior to running the EMC program.
To optimize computation time the calculation was broken up into parts involving a re-
duced number of photons and run simulataneously on the CUNY-GC research cluster.
A 50[ls] × 50[ls] detecting area with a resolution of 0.1[ls] was used to monitor the light

backscattered around the incident direction over a time range of 50[ ls

olution of 0.1[ ls

backscattered light with arbitrary propagation direction was collected and the second
collected only light exactly backscattered (propagation direction anti-parallel to the inci-
dent beam). Computation time was further reduced by employing the circular symmetry
of the spatial proﬁles of the backscattered light to plot the backscattered intensity as a
function of radial distance from the point of incidence. This circular symmetry is at-
tributed to the normal incidence of the beam. All results presented correspond to the
collection of backscattered light with arbitrary propagation direction. As well each plot of
backscattered light intensities, weather spatial or radial, has been normalized according
to the total number of photons,N = 2 × 1011, used in the simulation.

3.1 Time-Resolved Backscattering

For time-resolved detection of light backscattered with the same polarization as the in-
cident beam (co-polarized backscatter), a ring centered on the point of incidence of the
beam is found to form. Initially the radius of the ring expands linearly with time. The
intensity of light at the ring-peak grows weaker as the ring expands. Fig. (1) shows the
intensity of the co-polarized backscattered beam for g = 0.96 at diﬀerent times. Ring
formation corresponds to the red peak which noticeably expands and becomes weaker
(as seen in the change in colorbar scales) as time progresses. The backscatted intensity
at the ring-peak is more pronounced than backscattering at the point of incidence (the
center of the plots). Ring formation was observed in co-polarized backscattered light for
all values of g ranging from 0.8 to 0.97.

Fig. (2) shows radial proﬁles of the backscattered intensity with same helicity as the

incident beam for g = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 and 0.95 at a single time t = 2[ ls
c ]. An important
feature illustrated in Fig. (2) is the weakening of the ring-peak as g increases. This is
due to increased forward-peaked scattering within the medium and a resulting decrease
in the likelihood of return of the photons with polarization of the incident beam.

For each value of g, the ring behavior in the backscattered co-polarized light evolved
in a similar way:
initially the ring expanded linearly in time away from the point of
incidence, growing weaker at each time step, until it reached a maximal radius at which
point the ring-peak ﬂattens and backscattering at the point of incidence begins to take
over, see Fig. (3). After suﬃcient time has passed the backscattered light converges to a
Gaussian-like distribution with peak at the point of incidence. The maximum radius of
the ring and time over which the ring is present (ring-lifetime), increases for increasing
values of g, prior to this ﬂattening eﬀect. This is a consequence of increased forward
scattering as g increases.

The ring behavior occurs due to successive near-forward scattering events which pre-
serve the polarization state of the photon as a result of polarization memory eﬀects[5],[6]
described earlier. The successive near-forward scattering events give rise to arc-like trajec-
tories of photons as they travel into the medium. Rings with smaller radii are composed
of shallow penetrating photons while rings with larger radii are composed of photons that
travel deeper, giving depth information about the scattering medium.

As g increases, the number of near-forward scattering events needed to bring a photon
back to the surface increases, giving rise to weaker ring-peaks and prolonged ring life-
times. The time-dependence of the rings is a result of photons penetrating deeper into the
medium as a result of forward scattering: photons that travel further into the media take
longer to backscatter along the semi-circular trajectories giving rise to ring formation at
later times. Fig. (4) shows a schematic depiction of this process. Fig. (5) shows the
linear dependence on time the ring radius displays up to the point of plateauing of the ring

peak. Beyond this plateauing the radial position of the peak of light intensity moves to
rmax = 0 as backscattering at the point of incidence takes over. This feature can be seen
in the “fall” back to zero of each curve in Fig. (5). As well, it illustrates the relationship
between anisotropy and the duration of the ring behavior of the backscattered light: the
ring is prevalent for longer times as g increases.

Light backscattered with the opposite helicity of the incident circularly polarized
beam is found to display a diﬀerent ring-like behavior for suﬃciently strong forward-
peaked scattering, g ≥ 0.85. Light is primarily backscattered at the point of incidence,
as a result of large angle scattering, with a secondary ring-peak forming some distance
away from the point of incidence. As in the case of the helicity preserved backscattered
light, the ring radius increases in time and the peak associated with the ring decreases
simultaneously.

Fig.

(6) displays the spatially resolved backscattering of light of opposite helicity
with respect to the incident beam (cross-polarized backscatter) for g = 0.96. The dark
red center of the plots correpsonds to backscattering at the point of incidence. The
secondary light blue peak is the ring-peak. Light backscattered at the point of incidence
results from the ﬁnite tail of the phase function, p(ˆs · ˆs′), peaked about the scattering
angle ˆs · ˆs′ = π. Because most of the light is transmitted as a result of forward-peaked
scattering, large angle scattering is dominant when looking at the backscattered light.
Large angle scattering is also responsible for the helicity ﬂip of the backscattered light[6].

As in the case of polarization preserved backscattering, the ring observed for light
bacskcsattered with opposite polarization of the incident beam moves away from the
point of incidence as time progresses, growing weaker as it does so, until a plateauing
occurs with eventual convergence to a Gaussian-like distribution. Fig. (7) displays the

Inset: the radial proﬁle at t = 25[ ls

plateuing for the case in which g = 0.85. The inset displays the gaussian-like convergence,
with peak at the point of incidence, for long times. Again, the ring behavior is attributed
to successive near-forward scattering events with the presence of a small number (mostly,
single) of large-angle scattering events which are responsible for the polarization ﬂip
of the backscattered light, see Fig. (4). Light that travels deeper into the medium is
responsible for ring formation at later times while light that travels to smaller depths is
responsible for ring formation at early times. As g increases the ring-peak deminishes
due to increased forward scattering resulting in greater transmittance of light, see Fig.
(8).

Lastly, a comparison of rings formed by co-polarized and cross-polarized backscattered
light at equal times and equal anisotropies reveals that the radial position of ring-peaks
composed of light with preserved helicity are greater than the radial position of ring-peaks
composed of light with ﬂipped helicity, see Fig. (9). This is attributed to large angle
scattering in which photons deviate from the successive near-forward scattering paths
comprising the arc-like trajectories going back towards the incident surface. As a result,
the photons that undergo large angle scattering towards the incident surface have their
polarizations ﬂipped and traverse a shorter path inside the scattering medium, resulting
in a smaller ring radius, Fig. (4).

3.2 Continuous-Wave Backscattering

In the continuous-wave case, no ring formation is observed in the backscattered light of
either preserved or ﬂipped helicity with respect to the incident beam. Fig. (10) shows the
spatially resolved continuous-wave backscattered intensity of both helicities with g = 0.96.
The radial proﬁles for g = 0.80, 0.85, 0.9 and 0.95, Fig. (11), as well show no ring

formation. Backscattering is dominated at the point of incidence with no ring features.
The absence of ring formation in the continuous wave backscattered light of either
helicity is attributed to the smearing of the ring structure where time is integrated over
all time steps. Figures 12 and 13 compare the continuous wave proﬁles (solid green
lines) of preserved and ﬂipped polarizations, respectively, to snap shots of the time-
resolved proﬁles for various times. The continuous wave (time-averaged) proﬁles have
been superimposed on the time-resolved proﬁles for comparison.

4 Discussion

Ring formation of backscattered light was ﬁrst described by Kim and Moscoso[7] who
predicted a time-independent ring formation using the scalar time-independent Fokker-
Planck approximation to radiative transfer in forward scattering media.
It was also
postulated by these authors that the light composing the ring was of the same helicity
of an incident circularly polarized beam. Ring formation was described by Kim and
Moscoso as a result of successive near forward scattering events, due to the forward-
peaked scattering nature of the particles, which gave rise to a steady state semi-circular
trajectory of photons inside the medium. The EMC results presented here suggest partial
agreement with Kim and Moscoso however, EMC diﬀers in that it predicts a strictly
time-dependent ring formation. As well, the EMC results predict ring formation for light
backscattered with the same and opposite helicity as that of the incident beam.

The results of the EMC simulation provide a basis for the following explanation of
backscattered photon transport in forward-peaked scattering media involving time de-
pendence. In the case of helicity preserved ring formation, the ring peak moves outward
away from the point of incidence in time and grows weak simulatneously. This behavior
can be understood in terms of successive near forward scattering events in which diﬀer-
ent amounts of light penetrate deeper into the medium than others, see the schematic in
Fig. (4). Light that travels to shallow depths is responsible for ring formation at early

times. Due to the forward-peaked nature of scattering, light that travels deeper into the
medium is predominantly transmitted with only a small constituent being successively
scattered to form arc-like trajectories. This light is responsible for ring formation at later
times. This gives rise to an ever widening ring radius and an ever decreasing ring peak
as time progresses. As well, it explains why ring peaks are smaller as g increases: light
is scattered about a smaller distribution of angles about the forward direction increas-
ing the likelihood of transmittance. As well, the arc-like trajectories become longer as
anisotropy increases due to the smaller deviations from the forward direction of the scat-
tering angle resulting in longer ring lifetimes. The ring behaviors described here may be
experimentally observed using time-resolved femtosecond pulses using a streak camera or
Kerr gate.

In the case of helicity ﬂipped backscattering, light is backscattered with high likelihood
at the point of incidence and a secondary ring location. Backscattering at the point
of incidence is attributed to the structure of the phase function of the forward-peaked
scatterers. There is a ﬁnite peak in the phase function about the scattering angle π giving
rise to a ﬁnite probability of backscatter with helicity ﬂip. Because photons are primarily
transmitted due to the forward-peaked nature of scattering, light scattered through a
large angle dominates when analyzing backscatter. Ring formation in this case is a
result of forward-peaked scattering events combined with large angle scattering events.
Forward-peaked scattering brings about the ring behavior while large angle scattering
at some point along the photon’s trajectory is responsible for the helicity ﬂip of the
photon and the decreased ring radius, see Fig. (9). For values of g < 0.85, oﬀ-forward
scattering remains dominant to the point of quenching opposite helicity ring formation
when collecting backscattered light with arbitrary propagation direction. As a result,
backscatter is dominant at the point of incidence with a Guassian-like distribution as
distance from the central point of incidence increases.

Figure 14: Time evolution of simultaneous collection of co-polarized and cross-polarized
backscattered light for g = 0.85.

The analysis of continuous-wave backscatterd light revealed an absence of ring forma-
tion. This can be reconciled with the time-dependent nature of ring formation presented
above by recognizing that the time integration destroys the ring structure. It is noted that
the dependence of ring formation on the collection angle of backscattered light is weak in
the presence of high anisotropy, g ≥ 0.85. When scattering becomes more isotropic it is
expected that ring formation will ﬁrst be observed when collecting light exactly backscat-
tered anti-parallel to the incident beam. Lastly, the ring behavior can be observed when
collecting light of both preserved and ﬂipped polarizations simultaneously, Fig. (14).

5 Conclusion

The EMC method was used to investigate the backscattering of circularly polarized light
at normal incidence to a half-space of forward scattering particles ranging in anisotropies
of g = 0.8 to g = 0.95. The spatial dependence of the backscattered intensity is examined
for both the time-resolved and continuous-wave cases. Time-resolved analysis reveals ring
formation for both co-polarized and cross-polarized backscattered light for g ≥ 0.85. For
values of g < 0.85, oﬀ-forward scattering remains dominant to the point of quenching ring
formation when collecting backscattered light with arbitrary propagation direction and
opposite polarization with respect to the incident beam. Ring behavior is similar in both
types of backscattered light: the ring radius grows in time with the ring-peak decreasing
simultaneously. The ring pattern is more pronounced when light is backscattered with the
same polarization as the input. For the continuous-wave case, no such ring is observed.
The ring formation presented in this study provides an important clue for understanding
how light is backscattered from forward scattering media. Speciﬁcally, the EMC results
suggest that photons undergo successive near-forward scattering events. Futhermore,

15

these ﬁndings suggest that backscattered light is comprised of photons undergoing arc-
like trajectories within the medium.
In addition, the photons penetrate to diﬀerent
depths such that rings that form near the point of incidence of the pencil-like beam
(at early times) are comprised of photons that have penetrated to smaller depths while
rings that form further away from the point of incidence (at later times) are comprised
of deeper penetrating photons. This knowledge may have potential use in polarization
imaging techniques to aquire depth information of targets. Ring formation with cross-
polarized backscattered light arises from succesive forward-peaked scattering events over
most of the photons path with large angle scattering events taking place at some point
along the trajectory to ﬂip the photon’s helicity. It is the large angle scattering events
which give rise to smaller ring radii than in the case of light backscattered with preserved
polarization. It is noted that these results come in contrast to previous theoretical studies
of backscattered light using the scalar time-independent Fokker-Planck approximation to
radiative transfer[7] which predict a continuous-wave ring formation. The results given
by the EMC method suggest that the time dependence and polarization state of the
scattered light intensities play a crucial role in understanding ring formation for forward
scattering media.

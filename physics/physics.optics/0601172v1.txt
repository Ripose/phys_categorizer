Extensive studies in the past have focused on precise calculations of the nonlinear-optical suscep-
tibility of thousands of molecules. In this work, we use the broader approach of considering how
geometry and symmetry alone play a role. We investigate the nonlinear optical response of potential
energy functions that are given by a superposition of force centers (representing the nuclear charges)
that lie in various planar geometrical arrangements. We ﬁnd that for certain speciﬁc geometries,
such as an octupolar-like molecule with donors and acceptors of varying strengths at the branches,
the hyperpolarizability is near the fundamental limit. In these cases, the molecule is observed to be
well approximated by a three-level model - consistent with the three-level ansatz previously used
to calculate the fundamental limits. However, when the hyperpolarizability is below the apparent
limit (about a factor of thirty below the fundamental limit) the system is no longer representable
by a three-level model; where both two-level and a many-state models are found to be appropriate,
depending on the symmetry.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Sum rules, as applied to the sum-over-states per-
turbation expression of the molecular nonlinear-optical
susceptibilities,[1] were ﬁrst used to calculate the fun-
damental
limits of the oﬀ-resonant hyperpolarizability
β,[2, 3] and the second hyperpolarizability, γ.[4, 5] The
role of oﬀ-diagonal elements, such as measured with Hy-
per Rayleigh Scattering,[6] were also considered.[7] In-
deed, the calculated fundamental limits were shown to
be useful in culling out bad measurements.[8] These cal-
culations were later applied to calculating the resonant
two-photon absorption cross-section[9, 10] as well as the
maximum possible two-photon absorption cross-section
when a molecule is doubly-resonant with the excitation
source.[11] The theory is supported by the fact that no
molecule has ever been found to break the fundamental
limit,[12] it has been used as a guide to develop better
small molecules,[13] and it is used to understand scaling
laws.[14]

While all molecules ever measured are found to fall be-
low the limit, it was pointed out that there is a gap be-
tween the fundamental limit and the molecules with the
largest measured nonlinear-optical susceptibility.[3, 5, 15]
This apparent limit, a factor of 103/2 below the funda-
mental limit, has two possible implications. Either, the
theory could be ﬂawed so that it overestimates the fun-
damental limit by more than a factor of thirty; or there is
another factor that acts to suppress the nonlinear-optical
response. To test the hypothesis that the theory has over-
estimated the nonlinear response, all one needs to do is
show that a system exists whose hyperpolarizability ex-

ceeds the apparent limit. The clipped harmonic oscilla-
tor, whose hyperpolarizability can be calculated analyt-
ically without approximation, has a hyperpolarizability
that is an order of magnitude larger than the apparent
limit, yet about a factor of two below the fundamen-
tal
limit
limit.[16] So, calculations of the fundamental
do not appear to be ﬂawed and seem to give a funda-
mental limit that is within reason. Given that very tal-
ented organic chemists have been working almost three
decades to improve the hyperpolarizability of molecules
through structure-property studies, and no molecule has
ever been found to breach the apparent limit, it is proba-
bly prudent to conclude that the best organic molecules
fall below the apparent limit because of some inherent
properties of the types of organic molecules that have
been synthesized.

While nanoengineering methods have been used to in-
crease the second hyperpolarizability per molecule to
within a factor of two of the fundamental
limit,[17] a
more careful analysis shows that the interactions between
molecules makes them respond collectively. As such,
the collection of molecules is acting like a single super-
molecule whose response is still well below the apparent
limit. So, the state of aﬀairs with regards to molecu-
lar hyperpolarizabilities is that all molecules ever mea-
sured and all analytical calculations ever performed fall
below the fundamental limit, though some of the calcula-
tions come close. This set of evidence supports the the-
ory of fundamental limits and the use of the three-level
ansatz.[18, 19] So, while a three-level model implies trun-
cation of the sum rules, which in the Sum Over States
(SOS) expression for β could lead to pathologies, the fact

that the results of this process are consistent with obser-
vation suggests that they are correct, though these nu-
ances deserve further study.

In the present work, we investigate how the geometry
of a molecule aﬀects its oﬀ-resonant hyperpolarizability
and conditions that lead to the maximum response. In
particular, we consider how molecular properties - such
as energy-level spacing and transition moments - are af-
fected by symmetry and set conditions that lead to a
maximized response that breaches the apparent limit and
approaches the fundamental limit. We ﬁnd that at the
fundamental limit, the system becomes a three-level sys-
tem; therefore, the three-level ansatz is obeyed.

The truncated sum rules have been shown to lead to
an absolute limit that scales properly when compared
with the set of all measured values of β.[2, 3] In par-
ticular, the very best molecules fall on a curve that is
a factor of 10−3/2 below the fundamental limit. Even
so, there have been questions raised as to the validity
of this approach[20] since the truncation process leads
to pathologies in some of the resulting sum rule equa-
tions. However, the pathological equations can be elimi-
nated based on the physical principles that the resulting
theory should be self-consistent, consistent with observa-
tions, and free from divergences.[18]

The three-level model is not meant to predict β for
the general molecule with many states, but to treat a
molecule that is getting close to being in the near-ideal
state of maximized β by concentrating, in correct pro-
portion, all of the oscillator strength into the two dom-
inant excited states. Then, by treating the system as a
three-level model (under these circumstances, the trun-
cated sum rules are an excellent approximation), we can
algebraically maximize the mathematical expression to
investigate what combinations of moments will bring us
to the maximum. We thus assume the proposed ansatz
that any quantum system close to the fundamental limit
is represented as a three-level model and that the trun-
cated sum rules, reduced in number by the physical re-
quirements listed above to the reduced set of sum rules,
thus yield the correct limiting case. The calculations we
present here are accurate enough to test the validity of
this approximation.

The process of applying the sum rules to the three-level
model of the sum-over-states expression of the hyperpo-
larizability, β, is described in the literature.[2, 3, 4, 5]

X = 0, the second excited state gets all of the oscillator

B. Numerical Techniques

Our work focuses on understanding how the symme-
tries of one- and two-dimensional molecules aﬀect the hy-
perpolarizability. As such, we solve the two-dimensional
Schr¨odinger eigenvalue problem

for the lowest ten to 25 energy levels, depending on the
degree of convergence of the resulting hyperpolarizabil-
ity. Since our problem is in 2D, we use a logarithmic
potential. For k nuclei with charges q1e, . . . , qke located
at points s(1), . . . , s(k), the potential is

where L is a characteristic length. We assume L = 2˚A,
which has the eﬀect that the force due to a charge at
distance 2˚A is the same as it would be for a Coulomb
potential.

We discretize the eigenvalue problem given by Equa-
tion 10 using a quadratic ﬁnite element method [21, 22]
and solve the resulting matrix eigenvalue problem for the
ten to 25 smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigen-
vectors by the implicitly-restarted Arnoldi method [23] as
implemented in ARPACK [24]. Each eigenvector yields a
wave function Ψn corresponding to energy level En. The

are computed, and these and the energy levels En are
used to compute β and all other quantities by the formu-

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we show how the hyperpolarizability
depends on symmetry by considering various arrange-
ments of force centers in two-dimensions.
In addition,
these studies can be used to determine which geometries
lead to enhanced hyperpolarizability. We will show how
this process sheds light on why there is a large gap be-
tween the best molecules and how one can approach the
fundamental limit. Geometries that we will consider in-
clude:

•

•

Two force centers of varying charge asymmetry
and separation, which tests how β depends on the
dipole moment.

Three force centers on a circle of varying charge
asymmetry and angular separation, which tests
how β varies as the systems makes a transition
from a monopole, to an octupolar arrangement to
a dipole, including the continuum between these
limits.

•

Three force centers on a circle with a fourth charge
at the center, where the middle force center’s charge
is varied.

Since the purpose of these calculations is to study only
the eﬀects of symmetry, all other details of the system

3

−

must be suppressed.
(This is in contrast to most real
molecular structures, in which it is diﬃcult to separate
symmetry from other eﬀects.) To this end, we assume
that the net nuclear charge is +e and that a single elec-
tron of charge
e is placed into this potential. As such,
we can imagine the nuclear skeleton as a collection of
force centers that are surrounded by tightly-bound elec-
trons, which screen the nuclei leaving a net charge of
+e. For simplicity, we assume these nuclear centers and
screening electrons are point charges, and we calculate
the wavefunction of the remaining electron with no elec-
tron correlations, from which we get the hyperpolariz-
ability.

A. Dipolar Symmetry

Figure 1 shows the calculated energy levels, hyperpo-
larizability, and the quantities deﬁned in Equations 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5 for a diatomic molecule as a function of charge
asymmetry.

There are two equivalent sum-over-states (SOS) ex-
pressions that can be used to calculate β. The stan-
dard expression is overspeciﬁed since it is possible to pick
transition moments and energies that are inconsistent
with the sum rules, therefore violating the Schr¨odinger
Equation. Using the sum rules, the dipole terms in the
SOS expression can be removed, yielding a more simple
equation.[25, 26] The SOS results are shown with open
triangles and the dipole-free expression is given by the
solid triangles. The larger triangles represent calcula-
tions using 10 states (the energy levels of the excited
states are shown in the upper part of Figure 1) while the
smaller squares show calculations using 25 states. The
diﬀerence between the two can be used as a test of con-
vergence of the SOS expression.[26] Note that all values
are normalized to the fundamental limit and all excited-
state energies are relative to the ground state energy.

There are several conclusions that we can draw from
the calculated values of β. First, the largest hyperpolar-
q2)/(q1 + q2) =
izability, for a charge asymmetry of (q1 −
0.55 is still more than an order of magnitude smaller than
the fundamental limit. Also, even at 25 states, the calcu-
lation has still not fully converged. (Both the SOS and
dipole-free expression should yield the same value at con-
vergence.) Secondly, we note that the separation between
sites used in this calculation is comparable to the sepa-
ration between atoms in an organic molecule; and, the
shaded region with a charge asymmetry of 0.0
0.25
is the typical range for organic molecules. In the shaded
region, the largest value of β is less than about 0.04,
consistent with the largest measured values of β and the
apparent limit(horizontal shaded region). As such, we
ﬁnd that for parameters typical of an organic molecule,
we get a small value of β; and, we ﬁnd that even for 25
states, the calculation has not yet converged, implying
that many excited states contribute to β. So, our 2-D
calculations are at least approximately consistent with

the behavior of real molecules.

When analyzing the importance of the excited state
energies and transition moments, it is more useful to re-
express Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 so that E10 is the
excitation energy to the state with the largest transition
moment and E20 is the excitation energy of the state with
the second largest transition moment. As such, when
the molecule approaches the fundamental limit, these are
the two states that share the total oscillator strength
of the molecule. Thus, we deﬁne E′ and X ′ to be the
parameters given by Equations 4 and 5 when the two
states of interest are the ones with the largest oscilla-
tor strengths while the unprimed parameters refer to the
two states with lowest excitation energies. The solid cir-
cles in Figure 1a label the states with the largest transi-

4

tion moment to the ground state while the open circles
label the second-most important state.
In Figure 1b,
the solid line represents the function f (E′)G(X ′). The
data points representing the calculated values of β of the
model molecule, however, are normalized to the funda-
mental limit, which uses Equation 7 with E10 as the state
with lowest excitation energy.

According to the three-level ansatz, near the funda-
mental
limit, the quantum system should be approxi-
mated by a three-level model. Since many states are re-
quired to calculate β, clearly, the diatomic molecule with
a 1 ˚A bond length is far from the fundamental limit. This
is consistent with the fact that the function f (E′)G(X ′)
(solid line in Figure 1b) is well above the data (triangles,
in Figure 1). Both f (E′) > 0.5 and G(X ′) > 0.5, so X ′
and E′ of the two dominant excited sates are close to op-
timal. Since β is far from optimized, this would suggest
that many excited states contribute to β, thus diluting
the response.

Figure 2 shows the same calculation with two force
centers separated by 4˚A for 10 states. Note that even for
this small number of states, the calculation has almost
converged. Also, β is well above the apparent limit and
is approaching the fundamental limit. As such, while the
system is not exactly a 3-level model, far fewer states are
required than for the case shown in Figure 1.
Indeed,
at the peak, the two calculations of β yield the small-
est fractional deviation, showing the highest degree of
convergence. This is consistent with the ansatz that as
fewer excited states contribute, the system more closely
approaches the ideal for maximizing β. Furthermore, the
function G(X ′)f (E′) is a better approximation to the
calculated values of β at the maximum, and, the energy
spacing, quantiﬁed by the function f (E′) and the oscilla-
tor strength, quantiﬁed by G(X ′) are both nearly maxi-
mized. Indeed, the plot of the energy levels clearly shows
how the ﬁrst two excited states are well separated when β
approaches the limit. Note that while the two dominant
states have the largest separation for zero charge asym-
metry, β = 0 in the centrosymmetric limit, as required
by symmetry arguments for an even-order susceptibility.
Since the calculated value of β varies slowly beyond a
charge asymmetry of 2.0, our plot does not extend into
the slowly-varying regime. However, it is important to
note that at a charge asymmetry of about 5.3, the neg-
0.305 and
ative value of normalized β peaks at about
approaches zero as the charge asymmetry is further in-
creased.

Our numerical calculations are in accord with the as-
sumptions used in calculating the fundamental limits and
with the ansatz that β is maximum when the system
collapses into a three-level model. Furthermore, β van-
ishes in the centrosymmetric limit, as expected for an
even-order susceptibility, and when ǫ = 1, when one of
the charges vanishes, again leaving a centrosymmetric
system. In the highly polar limit, β vanishes, which is
consistent with both a vast body of literature and the
sum rules, which show that an arbitrarily large dipole

moment diﬀerence necessarily is accompanied by a small
transition moment to that state.[19] Most importantly,
β for a physically reasonable amount of charge asym-
metry peaks near the fundamental limit. However, the
nuclear separation of 4˚A is much larger than for typical
organic molecules, in which the separation between car-
bon atoms is between about 1˚A and 1.5˚A. This may be
one factor that contributes to the thirty-fold gap between
the fundamental limit and the best 1-dimensional organic
molecules.

B. Octupolar Symmetry

Figure 3 shows the diagonal component of the hyper-
polarizability along the horizontal axis of a molecule of

three equal charges (each of magnitude e/3) conﬁned to a
circle of diameter 5˚A, as shown in the inset of Figure 3a.
One charge is ﬁxed and the other two charges are sym-
metrically moved around the circle. When θ = 0, the
charge distribution forms a monopole while for θ = 120o,
the system is a pure octupole (i.e. when monopole and
dipole moments vanish). When θ = 180o the molecule
has strong dipole character. As such, the system goes
dipole as θ varies contin-
from monopole
uously from 0o to 180o.

The hyperpolarizability depends on angle as expected.
For example, several cases of energy-level crossing and
degeneracies are observed at θ = 120o, as expected for
states near the ground state for a system with three-fold
symmetry. Also, while only 10 states are used in the cal-
culation, the SOS expression and dipole-free expression
- within the resolution of the size of the triangles, both

yield the same hyperpolarizability; an indication that the
calculation has converged. This is consistent with the
fact that the oscillator strength is shared among a small
number of states so that the largest observed value of β
at around 145o is near the fundamental limit.

145o with β

A molecule has a nonzero even-order nonlinear-optical
response only if it is non-centrosymmetric. For a second-
order process, only polar or octupolar symmetries will
yield a non-vanishing hyperpolarizability.[27] An inter-
esting question is which symmetry yields the largest β.
For the purely octupolar molecule, when θ = 120o, the
hyperpolarizability is well above the apparent limit with
β = 0.3βMAX
. However, the hyperpolarizability peaks
at θ
. So, we conclude that the
best molecular symmetry is a mixture of octupolar and
dipolar character. In the monopole regime, β is negative
and below the apparent limit. It becomes large and pos-
itive only as the system approaches the octupolar limit.
At 120o, when the molecule is purely octupolar, the
function f (E′) is near a maximum because the two dom-
inant states are the furthest apart in energy. It is inter-
esting to note that the ﬁrst two excited states become
degenerate, but only one of those degenerate states dom-
In fact, at that point,
inates in its oscillator strength.
the energy of the dominant state crosses over from being
the second excited state for θ < 1200 to being the lowest
energy ﬁrst excited state for θ > 1200. Interestingly, β
is by far the largest - and well above the apparent limit,
when the dominant state is of lowest energy. Most impor-
tantly, near the peak of maximum calculated β, the value
of f (E′)G(X ′) and β are nearly equal, which again shows
that the three-level ansatz holds for molecules whose sus-
ceptibilities are near the fundamental limit.

Finally, it is interesting to note that the the function
G(X ′) is near unity for all angles larger than about 150o.
In this regime, the decrease in β can be attributed to
f (E′) since the two dominant state energies are getting
closer together. At θ = 180o, the three-charge system
reduces to the diatomic molecule with a charge asym-
metry of 1/3. Comparing these results with Figure 2,
where G(X ′) is near unity between a charge asymmetry
of 0.2 and 0.5, the value of β in the 2-charge system is
also clearly dominated by f (E′). A comparison of these
two cases also shows that for a diatomic system, a charge
separation of 4˚A is near optimum, giving a larger value
of β than for a 1˚A or 5˚A separation.

The charge arrangement in Figure 3 is unphysical when
compared with typical octupolar molecules, which are
usually conjugated from the center outwards along the
three prongs of the molecule. To make the system more
realistic, we have ﬁxed the angle between the charges at
145o, which yields the largest Figure β but have added a
center charge to represent conjugation through the cen-
ter, as shown in the inset of Figure 4. The hyperpolar-
izability along the horizontal axis of such a molecule of
diameter 5˚A is calculated and plotted in Figure 4b as a
function of the center charge under the constraint that
the total charge is ﬁxed at +e. When the center charge is

0.05e, normalized β is maximized. This suggests that

a small amount of negative charge in the center of the
molecule acts to push the electrons to the outer parts
of the molecule, which appears to be advantageous for
maximizing β.

At a center charge of +1e, all of the charges on the
circle vanish, making the molecule centrosymmetric re-
sulting in a vanishing value of β. Similarly, when the
e, β also becomes small. Note
center charge is about

becomes dominant and the ﬁrst excited state becomes of
secondary importance. This inversion is only observed
in this one geometry. However, the calculated value of β
continues to behave smoothly.

shown in the inset of Figure 4 with a center charge of
0.05 e. The electron in the ground state is mostly
−
shared by the two charges on the left. The transition
from the ground state to the dominant state shows strong
charge transfer yielding a dominant excited state with
82% of the charge centered on the righthand charge.
This is a strong dipolar transition with a large oscilla-
tor strength. The higher-energy sub-dominant state, on
the other hand, shows almost an equal distribution of
charge across the whole molecule. Our calculations thus
suggest that the ideal molecule may be an octupolar one
with slightly broken symmetry that results in strong but
asymmetric charge localization.

It is useful to consider in some detail the properties
that lead to such a large response since this paints a por-
trait of the ideal molecule with a β value that approaches

7

the fundamental limit. This hybrid molecule with opti-
mum geometrical and dynamical parameters that lead to
a maximum value of β, then, has two equal donor groups
on one side of the molecule and an acceptor group on the
third prong lies along the symmetry axis between the two
donors. The force center at the geometric center of the
molecule is slightly negatively charged. Due to the asym-
metry of this geometry along the excitation axis, all of
the lower-energy states are non-degenerate and two well-
separated excited states dominate the response. Further-
more, these two excited states share oscillator strength
in just the right delicate proportion as conﬁrmed by the
fact that G(X)
1. Interestingly, the electron density
is well localized on the two donor groups in the ground
state and centered on the acceptor in the dominant ex-
cited state. On the other hand, the subdominant state
shows full charge delocalization. There is no reason why
such a molecule could not be synthesized.

≈

From the perspective of designing and synthesizing a
molecule, it is useful to have other means of controlling
the symmetry in addition to varying the angle of the
bonds. Another option is to ﬁx the positions of the three
force centers, and allow the magnitude of the charges
to vary. Since it is possible to make planar octupolar
molecules with various donor and acceptor groups on
their three ends, we calculate the case of three evenly-
spaced charges on a circle of diameter 5 ˚A. Two of
the force centers have equal charges (each of magnitude
ǫ)/2), with the β component measured along the
e(1
symmetry axes running through the unique charge (of
magnitude ǫe) and bisecting the line between the other
two charges, as shown in the inset of Figure 6. As the
parameter ǫ is varied from 0 through 1, the net core elec-
tron charge varies from being evenly split between the
left and righthand side of the molecule to all being on
the left. When ǫ = 1/3, the core electrons are evenly
shared by the three nuclei leading to a nuclear charge
distribution that forms a pure octupole.

−

For the pure octupole, when all three charges are equal
(ǫ = 1/3), β is a local maximum; and, its value is consis-
tent with Figure 3 when ǫ = 0. Up to the octupolar limit,
the second excited state is the dominant one. For larger
charge asymmetry beyond the observed crossover point
between the two lowest-energy states, where the sign of β
changes, the ﬁrst excited state dominates and β peaks at
a negative value when ǫ = 1/2. At the peak, then, there
is an equal amount of charge on the left and right sides
of the molecule. So, by controlling the relative strengths
of the charges between the two sides of the molecule to
balance the charge, the optimum is reached.

Once again, near the peak value of β - which is near
the fundamental limit, the measured values of β are near
f (E′)G(X ′) and the second most dominant state is the
third excited state. β is near f (E′)G(X ′) until a charge
asymmetry of about ǫ = 0.8, at which point the sixth
excited state becomes the second most dominant state.
Above ǫ = 0.8, β is much smaller than f (E′)G(X ′). So,
the simplest paradigm for reaching the fundamental limit

may be to synthesize molecules with three-fold symmetry
with donors and acceptors of unequal strength.

Recall that when the fundamental limit of a nonlinear-
optical susceptibility is calculated, the three-level ansatz
is used; that is, at the fundamental limit the system must
be identically a three-level system. While the present
calculations show some large values of β that approach
the fundamental limit, the best molecules are still more
than a factor of 1/3 from the limit. So, it is interesting
to check if a three-level system appears to be a good
approximation when its hyperpolarizability is close to the
fundamental limit.

Figure 7 shows the magnitude of the transition mo-
ments from the ground state as a function of center
charge for the molecule described in Figure 4 for the low-
est nine energy levels. The dashed vertical line shows
the value of charge asymmetry at which the hyperpolar-

izability peaks. The circled points correspond to the two
largest transition moments. Note that Figure 4 shows
that nine states are suﬃcient based on the convergence
test of β.[26] As such, we can conclude that only two ex-
cited states dominate the hyperpolarizability, consistent
with the ansatz that when a quantum system has a hy-
perpolarizability at the fundamental limit, the system is
identically a three-level system. In our calculation, how-
ever, it must be pointed out that β is not at the funda-
mental limit and while two states dominate, there are still
small contributions from a third excited state, which is
probably the cause of β falling shy of f (E′)G(X ′). Also,
we should point out that for a central charge of about
0.4, only one excited state dominates so that the system
is represented by a two-level model. However, β at that
point is small, and is near the apparent limit. This illus-
trates how a two-level model (which is commonly used for
analysis by experimentalists) is not useful in describing
systems near the fundamental limit, and is also consistent
with the three-level ansatz.

The shaded region in Figure 7 corresponds to a range
in the center charge’s magnitude that places the hyper-
polarizability below the apparent limit.
In this region,
the system is clearly no longer described by a three-level
model. This is consistent with the fact that all molecules
ever measured fall below the apparent limit and that
most molecules are not well described by a three-level
model. Indeed, the cause of the gap between the apparent
limit and the fundamental limit is most likely due to the
fact that the oscillator strength in most real molecules is
spread over many excited states, diluting the nonlinear-
optical response. The trick, then, is ﬁnding molecules
that have only two dominant excited states.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have calculated eﬀects of symmetry and geom-
etry on the oﬀ-resonant hyperpolarizability of two-
dimensional systems and ﬁnd that the results are near
the fundamental limit under certain conditions. For ex-
ample, the hyperpolarizability peaks at a negative value
in an octupolar molecule when the three force centers
have charges e/4, e/4, e/2, corresponding to a molecule
with two donors on one side of the molecule each of half
the strength as the one acceptor on the other side. On
the other hand, the hyperpolarizability peaks at a pos-
itive value when two of the three prongs are separated
by 145o; and, a fourth charge, when placed at the center
that acts as a donor increases β. In this case, the ground
state and dominant exited state are strongly localized
and are connected by a large-oscillator-strength dipolar
transition. This may perhaps be the ideal moelcule.

In those cases where the hyperpolarizability peaks near
the fundamental limit, the system is found to be well ap-
proximated by a three-level model, which agrees with the
ansatz that a molecule whose nonlinear susceptibility is
at the fundamental limit must be identically a three-level
system. When the hyperpolarizability is below the appar-

9

ent limit, usually the oscillator strength is shared between
many states, which results in dilution of the hyperpolariz-
ability. Thus, our calculation agrees with real molecules,
which are all measured to be below the apparent limit
and require many states in order to model the nonlin-
ear susceptibility. Ironically, for parameters that make
our simple molecules describable by a two-state system,
the value of β is found to be well below the fundamental
limit.

To summarize, our simple symmetry-based calcula-
tions suggests the ideal geometry and charge distribution
of an asymmetric octuple that maximizes the hyperpo-
larizability, conﬁrms the three-level ansatz that molecules
with β near the fundamental limit are dominated by three
excited states, and may shed light on the origin of the gap
between the best molecules and the fundamental limit.

We measure and stabilize the relative angle of (anti-)parallel laser beams to 5 nrad/√Hz resolution
by comparing the phases of radio frequency beat notes on a quadrant photodetector. The absolute
accuracy is 5.1 µrad and 2.1 µrad for antiparallel and parallel beams, respectively, which is more
than 6 and 16 times below the Rayleigh criterion.

Lasers are universal tools as high-precision “rulers”,
i.e., references of length, time, and/or spatial direction.
Examples are the deﬁnition of the meter, experiments in
fundamental physics [1, 2], and precision inertial sensing.
Extremely high accuracy, both in terms of frequency and
phase [3] as well as pointing stability is demanded in atom
interferometry [4, 5, 6], which is applied for atomic clocks
and inertial sensing for the measurement of Newton’s
constant G, the local gravitational acceleration g, and
the ratio of the Planck constant to the mass of an atom
~/M . In atom interferometers that use two-photon tran-
sitions driven by counterpropagating laser pulses as beam
splitters [7, 8], the phase of the matter waves is measured
keﬀ
cos α,
against the eﬀective wavevector
|
where α
π is the angle between the individual wavevec-
tors k1,2. Present precision atom interferometers, such
as the measurement of ~/M to a few 10−9 absolute accu-
racy, require the same level of accuracy in
[9], and
further improvements are expected. For an accuracy goal
of 10−10, initial misalignment, vibration, or creep in the
counterpropagation angle α must be kept below 15 µrad.
However, creep of conventional optics setups leads to a
systematic error of the order of 10−9 in
in present
experiments [9]. Therefore, we developed an active con-
trol system to stabilize the alignment of (anti-)parallel
laser beams.

The power of optical systems to resolve a small angle β
between light rays is often given in terms of the Rayleigh
criterion β & λ/a, where λ is the wavelength and a the
aperture [10]. Even for the large beam diameters com-
mon in atom interferometry (in our setup, λ = 0.852 µm
0.8 cm, which implies a
and the beam waist w0
a/π
≈
34µrad), sub-Rayleigh align-
Rayleigh criterion of λ/a
ment is necessary for a 10−10 precision in
. Con-
|
ventional methods of measuring the angle β are not well
suited for this purpose: For example, a pair of pinholes
is often used to test the alignment, but it does not indi-
cate the direction of a misalignment. Often, the pinholes
cannot be placed at a suﬃcient distance (similar to the
Rayleigh range zR = πw2
0/λ, 240 m for our beams) to eas-
ily meet the Rayleigh criterion; instead placing them at
the focal distance of lenses may lead to situations where
maximizing the transmission does not mean the beam is
properly aligned. Active alignment is facilitated by using
a corner cube to retroreﬂect one of the beams, and test-
ing the parallelity afterwards. (Hollow corner cubes that
are certiﬁed to have sub-arc second (
5 µrad) alignment
errors are commercially available.) For beams derived

FIG. 1: Schematic of the setup for antiparallel beams (for
parallel beams, the corner cube can be eliminated). The snap-
shot of the interference pattern is depicted for unrealistically
large β. Usually, there is only one fringe in the pattern. The
fringes are oscillating with the beat frequency ω.

from the same source, the interference fringes between
them can then be used to indicate the relative alignment
[11]. However, ﬂuctuations of the fringes caused by vibra-
tions make it hard to extract quantitative information,
and the beams must have the same frequencies. Instead,
we replace the dc readout by a radio frequency beat note
measurement (Fig. 1) and the amplitude measurement
by a comparison of the beat notes’ phases. Thus detect-
ing at frequencies above the technical 1/f noise ﬂoor of
lasers allows us to reach a sub-Rayleigh resolution that
is not compromized by vibrations as in dc or lower fre-
quency interference methods [12].

Whenenver two overlapped electromagnetic waves hav-
ing a frequency diﬀerence of ω are detected (using a
photodiode, for example), interference causes an oscillat-
ing component (“beat note”) at the diﬀerence frequency
ω. For an inﬁnitely small detector area, the beat note’s
phase is equal to the phase diﬀerence φ of the waves at
the location of the detector. For parallel beams, φ is the
same everywhere on the cross section of the beams. If
the beams are misaligned by an angle β
1, however,
φ = 2πrβ/λ is a function of the distance r from the cen-
ter on the plane of incidence normal to one beam (Fig.
1). Thus, comparing the phases φ(r) of beat notes taken
at diﬀerent locations reveals the angular alignment. For
separately measuring the two relevant angles, we measure
the phases between two pairs of detectors. Therefore, we
split oﬀ a
1% intensity sample using a residual reﬂec-
tion from a polarizing beam splitter (PBS), where the
polarizations are set for maximum transmission (Fig. 1).

The sample beams are directed to a quadrant photode-
tector (QD), one by retroreﬂection from the corner cube.
For calculating the phase diﬀerences for a QD of ﬁnite
radius R, we calculate the interference pattern due to
two Gaussian beams within the Rayleigh range (where
the wavefronts are essentially ﬂat), tilted relative to each
other by an angle β

where r and θ are cylindrical coordinates on the QD’s

tion of, e.g., the detector, the corner cube, or the PBS
with respect to the beams (assuming no corner cube er-
rors and that the setup is small compared to the wave-
length of the beat frequency). Also, if the interfering
beams are parallel, but not accurately overlapped, the

additionally the center of the QD is oﬀ the center of the
interference pattern. Also note that φ13 and φ24 are in-
dependent of the rf frequency and that imbalances in
photodetector sensititivity or area should not oﬀset the
zero of the phase measurement. This insenitivity to sys-
tematic eﬀects and the linear dependence of the signal
(rf phase diﬀerence) on the counterpropagation angle β
make our method well suited for reaching sub-Rayleigh
absolute accuracy.

The optical setup is built on a (ﬂoating) optical ta-
ble, using standard lens holders and mirror mounts.
The signals from the quadrants are ampliﬁed by trans-
impedance ampliﬁers in the cascode transistor conﬁgura-
tion [11], using LM7171 operational ampliﬁers. The am-
pliﬁers have a bandwidth of 40 MHz to reduce their phase
shifts to 40 mrad at ω = 2π
1 MHz, corresponding to
a 0.4 µrad oﬀset in β; this, however, cancels out if the
ampliﬁers are alike. The ampliﬁed signals are converted
to ECL signals by four comparators (type AD96687).
This reduces the inﬂuence of laser power variations on
the subsequent stages. Double-balanced mixers (DBMs),
type LPD-1 by Mini-Circuits, are used as phase detec-
tors. Since DBMs produce zero average output voltage
when driven by quadrature signals, we shift φ1 and φ4
by 90◦ using critically damped second-order low-pass ﬁl-
ters before the comparators. Alternatively, one could use
commercially available 90◦ power splitters, which work
over a frequency range of about 2:1 (also removing the
need for trimming). Using sample-and-hold type phase
detectors would eliminate the need for a phase shifter and
could have several GHz bandwidth. The dc output of the
10 kHz bandwidth and
mixers is low-pass ﬁltered to
∼
ampliﬁed by a factor of 10 to
12 V range. The sensitiv-
±
ity of this circuit to the rf phase diﬀerence is measured to
be 10.9 mV/mrad for the X channel and 10.2 mV/mrad
for Y, corresponding to a sensitivity to the beam mis-
alignment angle β of 0.72 V/µrad and 0.67 V/µrad, re-
spectively.

For testing and trimming the electronics, we use two
laser beams separated by 1 MHz in frequency and over-
lapped in a common single-mode ﬁber as a copropaga-
tion reference. After an initial trim of the phase shifters,
drift in the detection and signal processing causes be-
low 0.15 µrad beam alignment error over several weeks.

Varying the intensity of the laser beams by a factor of 8
causes an error below 0.7 µrad. (It causes substantial er-
rors only if one of the beat notes is too weak for the phase
to be accurately detected.) Thus, the overall long-term
error of the electronics is estimated as < 1 µrad.

We also study the inﬂuence of the optical elements on
the accuracy. Two counterpropagating beams are aligned
to produce zero misalignment error signals. Setting an
iris in front of the QD then causes no oﬀset larger than
0.5 µrad for diameters of 5-10 mm.
(For smaller diam-
eters, errors arise due to insuﬃcient signal amplitude.)
Shifting the corner cube orthogonally to the sample beam
directions by up to 8 mm causes an error below 1.4 µrad,
see Fig. 2 (a). We test rotating the PBS away from
its optimum position. For the dimensions of our setup
(Fig. 1), a 1◦ rotation oﬀsets the centers of the beams
on the QD by 3.3 mm from each other and by 5 mm - the
QD’s radius - away from the QD’s center for one beam.
This makes the signal amplitude drop strongly for two
of the quadrants, but even then any oﬀsets are below
0.8◦ (where
∼
the overlap of the beams and the detector area remains
reasonable), the error is below 1.3 µrad, see Fig. 2 (b).
The error ǫ in the retroreﬂection angle of the corner cube
is tested by rotating the corner cube around the beam
axis, which should cause a sinusoidal modulation of 2ǫ
peak to peak in the X and Y alignment error signals.
The data shown in Fig. 2 (c) shows a peak deviation

of ǫ = 4.6 µrad (including

10 µrad. However, for rotations below

For active control of the alignment by a proportional-
integral (PI) feedback, we use a pair of mirrors that can
be tilted by about 200 µrad using piezo actuators with a
sensitivity of
2 µrad/V. This works reliably, as demon-
strated by the 12 h time-trace shown in Fig. 4. The servo
corrects for short and long term alignment ﬂuctuations
3 nrad/√Hz residual noise
of the order of 20 µrad with
∼
in the error signals. In actual atom interferometry appli-
cations, parts of the optics may be mounted on a ﬂoating
vibration isolator, while other parts will have to be ﬁxed
to an optical table. The relative motion of these parts
would considerably increase the long term errors with-
out active stabilization. We plan to operate the beam
stabilization for about one second every few minutes and
store the applied correction. This should be suﬃcient
for keeping the error below 15 µrad at all times. The
time required for acquiring lock is set by the resonance
frequency of the piezo-actuated mirrors, about 1.2 kHz.

We have demonstrated a system for measuring and
maintaining the counterpropagation of
laser beams,
based on retroreﬂecting one beam and comparing the
phase of beat notes between them on a quadrant pho-
todetector. We reach a resolution of 5 nrad in 1 s inte-
gration time. Tests for systematic inﬂuences indicate an
overall absolute accuracy of better than 5.1 µrad. This
is six times below the Rayleigh criterion of 34 µrad. If
the setup is used for copropagating beams, the corner
cube inaccuracy is eliminated, giving 2.1 µrad absolute
accuracy.

We report on the dynamics of photodegradation and subsequent recovery of two-photon ﬂuores-
cence in a dye-doped polymer. The energy dependence suggests that photo-degradation is a linear
process while recovery is entropic. Such recovery could be useful to high-intensity devices such as
two-photon absorbers, which can be used in many applications.

The problem of photodegradation of dye molecules is
well known to high-intensity applications such as in gain
media and laser media.[1, 2] Peng and coworkers showed
that the ﬂuorescence spectrum from rhodamine B-doped
in a PMMA ﬁber decreased as a function of time when ex-
posed to an intense laser source but that the ﬂorescence
signal would partially recover.[3] Howell and coworkers
found that the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE)
signal of DO11 dye-doped PMMA polymer would fully
recover when left in the dark for a couple of days;[4] but
in liquids, there was no recovery.[5] (In the liquid studies,
the total sample volume was exposed to prevent recovery
due to mass transport from the surrounding reservoir.)
In the solid solution experiments, the decay constant in-
creased and the recovered ASE eﬃciency increased with
subsequent cycling of degradation and recovery - suggest-
ing that it may be possible to harden a material against
photodegradation by such cycling. The recovery mech-
anisms was attributed to phototautomerization followed
by dimer formation.[6] In the present work, we report
on photodegradation and recovery of two-photon ﬂuores-
cence (TPF) in the chromophore AF455 (shown in Fig-
ure 1) doped in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
polymer. AF455 is known to have a large two-photon
absorption cross-section and is therefore a promising op-
tical material for many applications.[7]

Figure 2 shows the experimental layout. The laser
beam is ﬁltered to remove all parasitic light and is split
into two parts. Each beam passes into a light-tight black
box through a small aperture. The beam scatters from
a piece of glass in the reference arm and is monitored
with a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The surface of an
AF-455 dye-doped PMMA polymer cylinder (with dop-
ing approximately 0.06% by weight) is illuminated in the
sample arm and the TPF signal is collected by a lens
and imaged onto the photocathode of a PMT. The re-
sponse of the PMT is spectrally broad enough to encom-
pass the whole TPF spectrum, so, the measured signal is
proportional to the integrated TPF energy. A small por-
tion of the incident beam is deﬂected to a power meter
to allow for continuous monitoring of long-term drift in
laser power while the reference arm is used to account for
pulse-to-pulse ﬂuctuations. The PMT signals are read by

a digital oscilloscope and stored for subsequent analysis.

The laser source is a Continuum tunable OPG laser
pumped with tripled Nd:YAG. The pulses are about 25ps
in duration at 10Hz. Since the AF455 sample is known
to have higher two-photon ﬂuorescence in the range 790-

830nm, the experiment was carried out at two wave-
lengths: 800nm, where TPF during degradation and
recovery were measured for laser energies of 6, 7, and
9 µJ/pulse and 828nm, where 3.5 and 7 µJ/pulse were
used. The 7 µJ/pulse runs were identical within experi-
mental uncertainty. Note that the peak power of the 9 µJ
pulse is about 0.36 M W . About half of the laser energy
reaches the sample, yielding energies of 1.75, 3, 3.5, and
4.5 µJ/pulse.

The sample was exposed to the laser source for 3 hours,
and the signals were recorded with the oscilloscope every
5 minutes. The laser beam was then blocked to allow
the sample to recover. A reading was taken every half
hour for 30 seconds over an 8 hour recovery period. The
sample was kept in the dark between readings so that
over the eight-hour period, the sample was exposed to
the pump laser for only 4 minutes over which time at
most 11 mJ of energy was deposited. After the recovery
experiment is completed, the sample is left in the dark
box for 3 days so that it can fully recover before the next
experiment.

The points in Figure 3 shows the TPF signal, normal-
ized to the reference signal, as a function of time, for four
diﬀerent pump pulse energies. While the system is being
pumped, the TPF signal decays, implying a degradation
process that depends on intensity. When the pump is
turned oﬀ, the signal recovers, implying an entropic pro-
cess that opposes the degradation process.

To model this behavior, we assume that in a time in-
terval dt a molecule absorbs α′Idt photons where I is the
number of photons per second incident on the molecule
and α′ the fraction of photons absorbed. If the fraction
of each absorbed photon that results in degradation is γ,
and the entropic decay rate is β, then the change in the
number of ﬂuorescing molecules, dN in the time interval
dt is,

dN = −N αIdt + β (N0 − N ) dt,

(1)

where N0 is the initial population of two-photon ﬂuoresc-
ing molecules, α ≡ γα′, and N0 − N is the population of
non-ﬂuorescing molecules.

and n(t0) is the population of molecules given by Equa-
tion 2 at that time. Since the TPF signal should be pro-
portional to the number of chromophores, N , the TPF
signal normalized to unity at time t = 0 should also fol-

a ﬁt of the data to Equations 2 and 3 with αI and β as
the two adjustable parameters..

We ﬁrst consider the time dependence of TPF recov-
ery. According to Equation 3, the time constant should
be independent of the laser power used in the degrada-
tion process. Indeed, we ﬁnd the time constants to all be
the same within experimental uncertainty. The average
is β = 5.51(±0.16) × 10−5 s−1. Figure 4 shows the values
of αI and β that are determined from a two-parameter
ﬁt of the decay data given by Equation 2. First, we note
that αI is a linear function of the laser pulse energy. The
degradation mechanism therefore must be a linear func-
tion of the intensity for the range of measured intensities,
suggesting the mechanism to be a linear process such as
one-photon absorption. The inset shows the range of β

values determined from the recovery run using Equation
3 (two horizonal lines) as well as the from the decay run
using Equation 2 (points). In the limit of low intensity,
the two appear to converge. So, we propose the hypoth-
esis that during degradation, heating of the sample can
accelerate the recovery process. This suggests that the
recovery mechanism is entropic in nature.

In conclusion, we have observed that photodegradation
of a solid solution of the octupolar AF-455 chromophore
doped in PMMA polymer is reversible when the sample
is placed in the dark for over 9 hours. The TPF signal as
a function of time is well characterized by a model that
takes into account the competition between photodegra-
dation and entropic recovery. The energy-dependence of
the degradation process suggests that a linear process
such as one-photon absorption is responsible. The time
dependence of TPF during recovery for each run are sin-
gle exponentials, all with the same time constant, which
is consistent with our assumption that the recovery pro-
cess is entropic in nature. Furthermore, the low-intensity
limit of the degradation data appears to give the same

recovery time constant while at higher energies, where
the sample absorbs more energy and is therefore heated,
the time constant is shorter. This is also consistent with
the entropic model of recovery.

In high-intensity applications where photodegradation
is a hurdle, understanding the mechanisms of the re-
covery process may help in the design of better mate-
rials. Future studies will be aimed at higher intensities,
where degradation is dominated by multi-photon absorp-
tion. Simultaneous measurements of linear and nonlinear
spectroscopy along with TPF will undoubtedly lead to a
better understanding of the underlying recovery process,
which in turn, would enable the design of hardened ma-
terials.

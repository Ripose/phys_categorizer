We present a theoretical formulation of competition among electromagnetically induced trans-
parency (EIT) and Raman processes. The latter become important when the medium can no longer
be considered to be dilute. Unlike the standard formulation of EIT, we consider all ﬁelds applied
and generated as interacting with both the transitions of the Λ scheme. We solve Maxwell equations
for the net generated ﬁeld using a fast-Fourier-transform technique and obtain predictions for the
probe, control and Raman ﬁelds. We show how the intensity of the probe ﬁeld is depleted at higher
atomic number densities due to the build up of multiple Raman ﬁelds.

PACS numbers: 42.50.Gy, 42.65.-k

Multilevel atomic system interacting with several elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds can give rise to variety of phenomena
that depend on the strength and detunings of the ﬁelds.
Often, the various processes compete with each other,
whereby some processes are suppressed or interference
between processes renders the medium transparent to the
applied ﬁelds [1]. Well known examples include compe-
tition between third-harmonic generation and multipho-
ton ionization [2], and four-wave mixing and two-photon
absorption [3, 4]. Very recently, Harada et al. demon-
strated experimentally that stimulated Raman scatter-
ing can disrupt electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT), where the incident probe beam is depleted and
new ﬁelds are generated via Raman processes [5]. The
disruption of EIT is important to understand because it
may degrade the performance of EIT-based applications,
such as optical memories and buﬀers, and magnetome-
ters. In this paper we present a theoretical formulation
that enables us to study the competing EIT and various
orders of Raman processes to all orders in the applied
and generated ﬁelds.

The standard treatment of EIT [6] is based on the
scheme of Fig. 1, where the atoms in the state |ci in-
teract with a probe ﬁeld of frequency ω. A control ﬁeld
of frequency ωc interacts on the unoccupied transition
|ai ↔ |bi. The probe and the control ﬁelds are tuned
such that

This results in no absorption of the probe ﬁeld provided
the coherence ρbc has no decay. This treatment assumes
that the frequency separation ωbc is so large that the
interaction of the control ﬁeld ωc (probe ﬁeld ω) with

FIG. 1: (Color online) A schematic diagram of a three-level
atomic system with energy spacing ~ωbc between two ground
states |ci and |bi. The control ﬁeld with frequency ωc and
probe ﬁeld with frequency ω act on the atomic transitions
|ai ↔ |bi and |ai ↔ |ci, respectively.

the transition |ai ↔ |bi (|ai ↔ |ci) can be ignored. At
high atomic number densities or for strong ﬁelds, this
approximation no longer holds, which is the situation we
consider here.

At higher densities, Raman processes start becoming
important [7, 8], such as those shown in the Fig 2, for
example. The Raman generation of the ﬁelds at ωc − ωbc,
ω+ωbc can further lead to newer frequencies like ωc−2ωbc.
In order to account for the Raman processes, we write the
electromagnetic ﬁeld acting on both the transitions as

where E(t) denotes the net generated ﬁeld. At the input
face of the medium E(t) has two components to account
for both control and probe ﬁelds

E(t) = Ec + Ep e−i(ω−ωc)t.

Under the Raman-resonance condition (1), we expect
E(t) to have the structure

E(t) =

Thus, E (−1) gives the strength of the Stokes process of the
Fig. 2(a); E (+2) gives the strength of the process of the
Fig. 2(b); and E (+1) describes the changes in the probe
ﬁeld. For low atomic number densities, we expect the
usual results and therefore E (+1) ≈ E and E (0) ≈ Ec.

To calculate the net generated ﬁeld E(t) for arbitrary
atomic number density, we have to solve the coupled
Maxwell and density matrix equations. We consider now
the situation as shown schematically in the Fig. 3. The
applied ﬁeld E(z, t) couples the excited state |ai to both
ground states |bi and |ci . Here 2γ’s represents rates

We have numerically solved the coupled set of equa-
tions when all the atoms are initially in the state |ci and
when the ﬁelds at the input face of the medium are given
by (3). We calculate E(l, τ ) and do a fast Fourier trans-
form to obtain the diﬀerent Fourier components of the
ﬁeld at the output face of the medium. This procedure
enables us to ﬁnd how the probe and control ﬁelds evolve
and determine when the Raman processes become im-
portant.
In the simulations, we have used parameters
that are appropriate for 39K vapor [8] to avoid numerical
problems. In this situation, the spontaneous decay rate

wavelength for the ground state |ci to excited state |ai

EIT Vs Raman Processes In this section, we present
the results of numerical calculations. In Fig. 4, we show
result for the low-density regime. In this region, we notice
almost no change in the probe ﬁeld and thus EIT dom-
inates. It is also seen that the Raman processes slowly
start to build up, leading to the drop in the control ﬁeld
amplitude.

FIG. 6: (Color online) The amplitudes of hyper Raman com-
ponents at frequencies (ωc − 2ωbc), (ω + 2ωbc) as a function
of the atomic density. All parameters are same as in Fig. (5).

We next consider the high-density regime, as shown
in Fig. 5. This is the region when multiple Raman pro-
cesses build up signiﬁcantly [9]. Our numerical results
are in broad agreement with the observations of Harada
et al.[5] where they observe the depletion of the probe
ﬁeld and the generation of the Stokes ﬁeld at (ωc − ωbc).
In particular, we see in ﬁg. 5 that the generation of radi-
ation at (ωc − ωbc) is very important and the probe beam
is depleted. We also notice a new feature - the probe ex-
hibits some oscillatory character before dying out. This
oscillation is due to the fact that any population that
is transferred to the state |bi can produce a ﬁeld at the
probe frequency via the Raman process. When this hap-
pens, the control ﬁeld amplitude falls.

In Fig. 6, we show the build up of several hyper-Raman
processes. The eﬀect of a buﬀer gas on the generated ﬁeld
is shown in Fig. 7, where it is seen that the amplitude of
the probe ﬁeld depletes faster in the presence of buﬀer a
gas. On comparison of Fig. 5 and Fig. 7, we see that the
amplitudes of the probe ﬁeld and the generated Raman
ﬁeld become equal at αζ/γ = 272 (without buﬀer gas)
and 84 (with buﬀer gas). This is in agreement with the
observation in Ref.[5].

In conclusion, we have investigated competition be-
tween electromagnetically induced transparency and Ra-
man processes in a Λ system due to the cross talk among
the optical transitions. We have demonstrated that the
EIT-induced probe spectrum is very pronounced in com-
parison to the higher order Raman sidebands for a low
atomic number density. However, the generated Raman
ﬁelds become dominant for an atomic number density
that is only ten times higher.

FIG. 7: (Color online) The amplitudes of Stokes, control,
probe and anti-Stokes ﬁelds as a function of the atomic num-
ber density in the presence of a buﬀer gas. Here, we have
scaled the amplitudes of probe, Stokes and anti-Stokes ﬁelds
by a factor of two. The other parameters are chosen as: den-
sity n = 1010 atom/cm3, input Rabi frequency ΩE = 0.5γ,
Ep/Ec = 0.5, ∆c = 0.0, Γbc = 0.01γ and ωbc = 100γ. A
nonzero value of Γbc accounts for the buﬀer gas.

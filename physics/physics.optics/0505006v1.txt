A New and Compact Sum-Over-States Expression for Calculating Nonlinear
Susceptibilities without Dipolar Terms

(Dated: October 28, 2012)

Using sum rules, the dipolar terms can be eliminated from the commonly-used sum-over-states
(SOS) expression for nonlinear susceptibilities. The dipole-free expression is more compact, con-
verges to the same results as the common SOS equation, and is more appropriate for analyzing
certain systems such as octupolar molecules.

The

(SOS)

expression for

sum-over-states

second-order nonlinear-optical

the
nonlinear-optical susceptibilities[1] has been used exten-
sively over the last 4 decades as a theoretical model of
the nonlinear response as well as a tool for analyzing
experimental dispersion data.
Indeed, the two-level
model has guided the development of molecules with
susceptibilities
large
(also called hyperpolarizabilities). The SOS equation
is expressed in terms of the matrix elements of the
dipole operator,
exnm, and the energy eigenvalues,
En. The sum rules demand that the dipole matrix
elements and energies be related to each other, so the
SOS hyperpolarizability can be expressed in terms of
a subset of the dipole matrix.[2] In this work we show
that all the dipolar terms can be eliminated to yield a
simpliﬁed expression that is equivalent to the full SOS
expression.

The ﬁrst term in Equation 2 is called the dipole term and
the second term the octupolar term; and, as we shall see
below, the dipole term can be expressed in terms of the
octupolar one using the sum rules.

The generalized Thomas-Kuhn sum rules are a direct
consequence of the Schr¨odinger Equation (without any
approximations) and relate the matrix elements and en-
ergies to each other according to:[3]

where m is the mass of the electron, and N the number

inﬁnite number of equations, one for each value of m and
p. As such, we refer to a particular equation using the
notation (m, p).

To eliminate the dipole term, we consider the Equation

The second term in brackets is the dispersion term that
arises from the dipolar terms.
In the standard SOS
expression, the simplest approximation is the two-level
model, with parameters x10, ∆x10, and E10. The sim-
plest approximation to Equation 8 is the three-level
model with parameters x10, x20, x12, E10, and E20. This
is in contrast to the standard SOS expression, where the
three-level model has two additional dipole terms.

It is important to note that while the dipole-free ex-
pression may seem to be less general than the common
SOS one, it is fully equivalent. Because the sum rules are
a direct consequence of the Schr¨odinger Equation, they
can not be violated in any atom or molecule. Interest-
ingly, the SOS equation, in its unrestricted form, can be
evaluated for unphysical values of the matrix elements
- yielding nonsensical values of the hyperpolarizability.
The restriction imposed on the SOS expression used to
get the dipole-free equation prevents certain unphysical
combinations of dipole and octupolar terms. Indeed, the
standard two-level model is a fully polar expression since
it ignores all octupolar terms. On the other hand, the
dipole-free expression - when truncated - is more appro-
priate for modelling octupolar molecules[4, 5, 6] as mea-
sured with hyper-Rayleigh scattering.[7, 8]

As an illustration of the utility of the dipole-free SOS
expression, we calculate the fundamental upper limit of
β[2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12] to show how it simpliﬁes the problem.
We start with the sum rules (0, 0) and (1, 1) truncated
to three levels, which yield

This is identical to the results from the usual sum-over-
states expression; however, the calculation is much more
straightforward because the dipolar term does not need
to be considered.

Next, we test the dipole-free SOS expression by com-
paring the results it gives with the standard SOS ex-
pression for a potential in which the Schr¨odinger Equa-
tion can be solved analytically. This approach ensures
that the energies and dipole matrix elements are physi-
cally sound and that pathologies or inaccuracies inherent
in approximation techniques are avoided. We choose to
use the exact solution to the clipped harmonic oscilla-
tor (CHO) (where the potential is harmonic for x > 0
and inﬁnite for x < 0) since it is the simplest case of an
asymmetric potential that yields a large hyperpolariz-
ability that is in fact near the fundamental limit.[13] The
matrix elements of the position operator of the clipped
harmonic oscillator (CHO) are given by,

Figure 1 shows the calculated oﬀ-resonant hyperpo-
larizability normalized to the maximum oﬀ-resonant hy-
perpolarizability as a function of the number of states
included in the calculation. Both theories converge to
the same result as the number of states included in the
sums is large, showing that the two models are identi-
cal. Note that the standard SOS expression converges
more quickly than the dipole-free expression, which sug-
gests that the clipped harmonic oscillator is dipolar in
nature. Presumedly, an octupolar molecule would be bet-
ter modelled with the dipole-free term, resulting in faster

Next we consider a particle in a 1-dimensional box that
is perturbed by the potential V = ǫx to make the system
asymmetric. First-order perturbation theory is used to
get the wavefunction to ﬁrst-order in ǫ, from which the
matrix elements of x are calculated. β is calculated from
these matrix elements also to ﬁrst-order in ǫ. This is
an interesting example because the wavefunctions, while
reasonably accurate, are still only approximate.

octupolar potentials. The average of the two models is
also shown, suggesting that a variational principle ap-
plied to the weighting factors of the average may yield

level model. Note that the matrix elements are accu-
rate to better than 5%, yielding convergence of the oﬀ-
resonance limit of the two 25-level models of β to better
than 7% of each other. However, near resonance, the two
models do not agree as well quantitatively - though the
qualitative features are similar. These variations are due
the inaccuracies introduced by the approximations used
in calculating the wavefunctions, so it is not possible to
determine which model is more accurate. However, based
on the two dispersion graphs, it is clear that the dipole
free-expression and standard SOS expressions are equiv-
alent to within the levels of uncertainty one expects from
the level of approximation used.
All higher-order nonlinear

susceptibilities can be
treated in the same way. As an illustration, we brieﬂy
consider the third-order susceptibility. Any diagonal
component of γ, the second hyperpolarizability, along the
x-direction is given by:

where Di(n, m, ...) are energy denominators and n, m, ...
are arguments that show which energies are represented
(i.e. En0, Em0, ...). In analogy to β as given by Equa-
tion 2, the denominators are of the form D1(n, l, m) =
¯h3En0(ωα)Em0(ωβ)El0(ωδ)/4e4 and are most easily de-
termined using Feynman Diagrams for the particular
phenomena of interest. There are two terms in Equa-
tion 18 that depend on the dipole moment, which can be
expressed as,

Using Equations 21 and 23, Equation 18 for γ can be
written in dipole-free form in analogy to Equation 5.

In conclusion, we have derived an expression that is
physically equivalent to the standard SOS equation for β
and γ, but does not include dipole terms. The fact that
they are identical is illustrated with the exact wavefunc-
tions of a clipped harmonic oscillator and approximate
wavefunctions of a particle in a tilted box. In both cases,
when the number of terms included in the sums is large,
the two results converge.

The dipole-free expression is more compact and is
therefore easier to apply to certain classes of problems,
such as calculating the fundamental limits of the nonlin-
ear susceptibility. The dipole-free expression should also
provide a more accurate means for analyzing the disper-
sion of β for octupolar molecules. For example, trun-
cating the sums in Equation 5 to the ﬁrst two excited
states (yielding the lowest-level model with numerator
x01x12x20) provides a more accurate expression for the
dispersion than simply setting the dipole term in Equa-
tion 2 to zero in the standard 3-level model. The new
theory for β and γ presented here therefore provides an
additional avenue for analyzing molecules that go beyond
the common dipolar push-pull paradigm.

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Using a generalized Gaussian beam decomposition method we determine the propagation of a
Laguerre-Gaussian beam that has passed through a thin nonlinear optical Kerr medium. The
orbital angular momentum per photon of the beam is found to be conserved while the component
beams change. As an illustration of applications, we propose and demonstrate a z-scan experiment
using an LG1

0 beam and a dye-doped polymer ﬁlm.

Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes were discovered soon af-
ter the invention of the laser1. A LG beam with angular
mode number l and transverse radial mode number p can
be written as:

For a given LG beam mode, zr (or ω0) alone is suﬃ-
cient to characterize the relative amplitude and phase of
the electric ﬁeld of the beam. When multiple beams are
involved, it is often necessary to specify the waist loca-
tions of each beam. For convenience we use the notation
zw; zr) to describe a LG beam unambigu-
C
ously, where zw is the waist location on the z axis and C
is a complex constant that gives the amplitude and the
initial phase.

The fundamental Gaussian beam LG0

0 has been the
most commonly studied LG mode in both theory and
experiment. However recently higher order LG beams,
especially those with higher angular mode number l, are
attracting more attention. When l > 1, the LG beam
possesses well deﬁned orbital angular momentum of l~
per photon2, zero on-axis intensity due to the phase sin-
gularity, and helical phase fronts. These properties make
high-order LG beams useful in many applications such
as optical manipulation of microscopic particles3, quan-
tum information processing4,5, orbital angular momen-
tum sorting6 and imaging7, nonlinear wave mixing8, op-
tical vortices9, scattering10, and interference11.
In the
present work, we develop a theory for the propagation
of an LG beam after it passes through a thin nonlinear
optical Kerr medium. The results of our calculation can
be used for novel z-scan measurements and new optical
limiting geometries.

The index of refraction of an optical Kerr medium de-
pends on the intensity I of the incident beam and the
nonlinear refractive index n2,

n = n0 + n2I,

(2)

where n0 is the linear refractive index. Consider a nonlin-
ear Kerr-type thin sample that is placed at the position

LGl0

p0 (r, φ, z; zr).
z = zs in a LG beam E(r, φ, z) = E0 ·
Under the thin sample approximation, which requires
that the change of the diameter of the beam due to either
linear diﬀraction or nonlinear refraction can be neglected
within the sample, the electric ﬁeld E′ at the exit surface
of the sample can be expressed as12,13

E′ (r, φ, zs) = E (r, φ, zs) e−αd/2e−i∆Φ(r,φ,zs),

(3)

where α is the linear absorption coeﬃcient, d is the sam-
ple thickness, and ∆Φ (r, φ, zs) is the nonlinear phase dis-
tortion,

is a constant proportional to the maximum nonlinear

(zs = 0) . When the incident beam is a LG0

∆Φ0 = ∆Φmax(zs = 0).

We generalize the so-called “Gaussian decomposition”
method14 to analyze the propagation of a beam that tra-
verses a nonlinear sample. The exponential in Eq. (3)
can be expanded in a Taylor series as

The complex electric ﬁeld of the incident beam after it
passes through the sample can be written as a summation

results are embodied in Eq. (7).

It is worth noting that all the component LG beams
have the same angular mode number l0 as that of the in-
cident beam, which reﬂects the conservation of the pho-
ton’s orbital angular momentum. Therefore the eﬀect of
the Kerr material on the incident LG beam is to gen-
erate new LG beams of diﬀerent radial modes. These
results are important in applications that leverage mode
sensitivity.

The expression in Eq. (7) is especially useful when the
nonlinear phase distortion is small enough so that only a
few terms in the summation are needed to make a good
approximation. To illustrate, assume that the incident
beam is a LG1
0 beam and the maximum nonlinear phase
distortion in the sample at position Z is

Eq. (11) suggests that it is possible to do a Z-scan ex-
periment using the LG1
0 beam to measure the nonlinear-
ity of a thin samples. We demonstrate this on a disperse-
red-1 doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (DR1/PMMA)
thin sample15. The nonlinearity of DR1/PMMA is due
to photo-induced trans-cis-trans isomerization of DR1
molecules followed by reorientation in the direction per-
pendicular to the polarization of the incident laser beam.
It can be treated as an optical Kerr eﬀect when the in-
tensity is low and the exposure time is short enough to
avoid saturation of the refractive index change. Figure 1
shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup. A
LG0
0 beam of 647 nm wavelength from a krypton laser is
converted into a LG1
0 beam by a computer generated bi-
nary phase mask16. The LG1
0 beam is then focused by a
lens to the desired Rayleigh length. A thin DR1/PMMA
sample is placed near the beam waist and a shutter (not
shown) is used to control the exposure time of the sam-
ple. A small aperture is placed on axis of the beam in
the far ﬁeld. The power passed through the aperture is
recorded by a detector as a function of sample position
z as well as the exposure time t. A fresh sample spot is
used for each exposure to avoid history eﬀects. Nonlinear
absorption is determined to be negligible with an open
aperture Z scan.

Figure 2 shows the result of the Z scan of a 1.4mm-
thick 2% w/w DR1/PMMA sample. The power of the
incident beam is 65 µW and the exposure time is 3 sec-
onds. The Rayleigh length of the beam is about 2.4cm.
The normalized transmittance is obtained by dividing the
power recorded by the detector at time t = 3s by that at
time t = 0s. The circles are the experimental data. The
solid curve is Eq. (11) with ∆Φ0 =
1.1 (∆Φmax(Z =
0.4), which gives n2 ≈ −
0) =

The shape of the Z scan curve using the LG1

0 beam dif-
fers from the traditional one using the LG0
0 beam in that
the former has an extra peak and valley (indicated in the
ﬁgure by the arrows). The appearance of this additional
structure is a consequence of the LG1
1 component beam
in Eq. (9). Although the amplitude of these features is
much smaller than the major ones, it has signiﬁcance in

0 beam while it is about 0.406

LG1
for
the LG0
0 beam. Another diﬀerence between the two is
that in the LG1
0 beam Z scan experiment the detector
is placed at the beam center where the intensity is the
weakest due to the screw phase dislocation while in the
LG0
0 beam Z scan experiment the center intensity is the
strongest. As a result the former shows a much bigger
deviation from the normal value if any phase or intensity
distortion that destroys the symmetry of the beam pro-
ﬁle is present. This suggests that the LG1
0 beam Z scan
experiment is more sensitive to changes of the n2 of the
sample.

In conclusion, we have calculated the propagation of
a Laguerre-Gaussian beam after it passes through a thin
nonlinear optical Kerr medium. Applications, such as the
z scan experiment using a LG1
0 beam described here, has
advantages over traditional measurements using a LG0
0
beam. These results can be applied to many other thin
ﬁlm applications such as optical limiting and nonlinear
beam interactions.

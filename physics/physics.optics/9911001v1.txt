The ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method is employed to solve the three dimen-
sional Maxwell equation for the situation of near-ﬁeld microscopy using a sub-wavelength
aperture. Experimental result on unexpected high spatial resolution is reproduced by our
computer simulation.

§1.

Introduction

Near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) 1), 2) is a powerful tool for the
study of nanometer features with spatial resolution of 50-100 nm. The heart of
NSOM is a near-ﬁeld probe, which is a metal-coated optical ﬁber tapered to sub-
wavelength aperture. When the probe end approaches a sample surface, the object
is illuminated and the reemitted light is collected in the near-ﬁeld region of the aper-
ture, whose diameter determines the spatial resolution of NSOM. Optical imaging
beyond the diﬀraction limit is carried out by scanning the probe on the surface. In
addition to this fundamental principle, the resolution of NSOM is also subject to the
tapered structure of the probe. Such a behavior has been demonstrated through our
NSOM spectroscopy of single quantum dots. 3), 4)

Numerical analysis of electromagnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the aperture and
propagation property of light in the tapered waveguide is quite advantageous for
the understanding of experimental results. We employ the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-
domain (FDTD) method 5) in the Mur absorbing boundary condition 6) to solve
the three-dimensional Maxwell equation for the same situation as the experimental
conﬁguration and discuss the validity of simulation results.

§2. Calculations

Figures 1 and 2 show the geometries of the problem. A near-ﬁeld ﬁber probe
with a double tapered structure collects luminescence (λ = 1µm) from a quantum
dot buried λ/10 beneath the semiconductor surface. We assume the source for
luminescence is a point-like dipole current linearly polarized along the x direction.
The radiation caught by λ/2 aperture is transported to the tapered region clad with

We run the simulation with time steps of c∆t = λ/(40√3) until the signal intensity

§3. Results

Figure 3 shows the calculated signal intensity as a function
of the displacement of the probe from the origin. For both scans
along x and y directions, the full width at half maximum of the
signal (spatial resolution of NSOM) is estimated to be around
0.25λ, which is much smaller than the aperture diameter of λ/2.
This performance is beyond the fundamental principle of NSOM
and in good agreement with the experimental result. Through
this preliminary calculation, we demonstrate that FDTD simulation is quite useful to
understand the behavior of light in the near-ﬁeld probe and to optimize its structure
for advanced measurements.

We show that the method of maximum-likelihood estimation, recently introduced in the context of
quantum process tomography, can be applied to the determination of Mueller matrices characterizing
the polarization properties of classical optical systems. Contrary to linear reconstruction algorithms,
the proposed method yields physically acceptable Mueller matrices even in presence of uncontrolled
experimental errors. We illustrate the method on the case of an unphysical measured Mueller matrix
taken from the literature.

In the mathematical description of both polarized light
and two-level quantum systems (or qubits, in the lan-
guage of quantum information), there are many analogies
and common tools. For example, the Poincar´e sphere [1]
for classical polarization and the Bloch sphere for two-
level quantum systems [2] are, in fact, the same mathe-
matical object. Although the classical concepts and tools
were introduced well before the quantum ones, the lat-
ter were developed independently of the former. Thus,
many well established results in classical polarization op-
tics have been “rediscovered” in the context of quantum
optics and quantum information [3]. Interestingly, the in-
verse process of borrowing results from quantum to clas-
sical optics has started only recently [4, 5].

In this Letter we give a contribution to this inverse
process by pointing out a connection between quantum
process tomography (QPT) [6] and classical polarization
tomography (CPT). Speciﬁcally, we show that the re-
cently introduced maximum-likelihood (ML) method for
the estimation of quantum processes [7, 8, 9], can be suc-
cessfully applied to the determination of classical Mueller
matrices. In the conventional approach to CPT, Mueller
matrices are estimated from the measurement data by
means of linear algorithms [10]. However, such recon-
structed Mueller matrices often fail to be physically ac-
ceptable [11]. We show that this problem is avoided by
using the maximum-likelihood method which allows to
include in a natural manner the “physical-acceptability”
constraint. Thus, thanks to a “quantum tool”, we solve
an important issue that has been long debated in the
classical literature [12, 13, 14]. This is in particular im-
portant in view of the present interest in CPT, e.g., for
medical and astronomical imaging.

To begin with, we give ﬁrst a qualitative description of
the connection between QPT and CPT. At the heart of
this connection lies the well known mathematical equiv-
alence (isomorphism) between the density matrix ρ de-
scribing a two-level quantum system and the coherency
matrix [1] J describing the classical polarization state of
a light beam [15, 16]:

ρ ∼ J/Tr J.

(1)

J is an Hermitian, positive semideﬁnite 2 × 2 matrix, as

is ρ. A quantum process that transform an input state
ρin in an output state ρout can be described by a linear
superoperator G : ρout = Gρin. Analogously, a classical
linear optical process (as, e.g., an elastic scattering pro-
cess), can be described by a 4 × 4 matrix M such that
J out = MJ in or, in explicit representation,

J out

Mij,klJ in

i, j, k, l ∈ {0, 1}.

In the same way as the reconstruction of G is the goal
of QPT, the estimation of the elements Mij,kl from the
measurement data is the goal of CPT. However, in the
common practice,
instead of the complex matrix ele-
ments Mij,kl one wants to determine the 16 real elements
Mµν, (µ, ν = 0, . . . , 3) of the associated Mueller matrix
M . In the ML approach, the estimated elements of M
are found to be the most likely to yield the measured
data. In what follows we show how to ﬁnd them.

In a classical polarization tomography experiment, the
measurement data are collected following the scheme
shown in Fig. 1. An input light beam is prepared in a

pure polarization state represented by the coherency ma-
trix J in
(b), and sent through the optical system S where
it is transformed in the output beam represented by
J out
(b) = MJ in
(b). The estimation strategy is to retrieve
information on the system from a series of polarization
tests on the output states J out
(b) obtained from distinct in-
put states J in
(b), (b = 1, . . . , B). A polarization ﬁlter P(a)
that allows the passage of light with speciﬁc polariza-
tion labelled by the index a, (a = 1, . . . , A), provides for

2

the polarization tests. Finally, the intensity Iab of the
beam after the ﬁlter is recorded. If we prepare B diﬀer-
ent input states and we perform A polarization tests per
each output state, then such a CPT experiment will have
A×B outcomes corresponding to all measured intensities
{Iab}, (a = 1, . . . , A, b = 1, . . . , B).

However, in a ML approach, which is a probabilistic
method, one deals with relative rather than absolute in-
tensities. Therefore, from the data set {Iab} we must
extract the relative intensities (or measurement frequen-
cies) fab = Iab/Ib, where Ib is the intensity of the in-
put light beam. Since by deﬁnition 0 ≤ fab ≤ 1 and
fab + fa′b ≤ 1, where a, a′ label two mutually orthogonal
polarization tests, then fab provides an experimental es-
timation of the theoretical probability pab for obtaining
a nonzero output intensity with polarization a when the
input beam is prepared in the polarization state b. The
theoretical probabilities {pab} can be written in terms of
the input and output states as [17]

where {ǫ(µ)} are the elements of the standard basis in
C2×2. By substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (3) we obtain

pab(M) =

HµνTr[Π(a)ǫ(µ)Π(b)ǫT

(ν)],

where the superscript T indicates the transposed matrix.
The probabilities pab(M) as written in Eq. (7) can still
be negative, because only H matrices associated with
physically acceptable Mueller matrices can guarantee the
condition pab ≥ 0. However, we know from the Mueller
matrix theory that the H matrix associated with a physi-
cally acceptable Mueller matrix must be positive semidef-
inite [12]. It is well known that any positive semideﬁnite
matrix can be written in terms of its Cholesky decompo-
sition as

where C is a lower triangular matrix

where we denoted with Π(a) = ˆe(a) ⊗ ˆe†
(a) the 2 × 2 pro-
jection matrix representing the action of the polarization
ﬁlter P(a) oriented along the (possibly complex) unit vec-
tor ˆe(a). Since in a CPT experiment the input beam is
always prepared in a pure polarization state, it can be
represented by a projection matrix Π(b) as J in
(b) = IbΠ(b),
where Ib = Tr J in
(b) is the intensity of the beam. Then we
can rewrite

pab(M) = Tr[Π(a)MΠ(b)]

(4)

where from now on we assume, without loss of generality,
Ib = 1. At this point, having measured the frequencies
{fab} and having calculated the probabilities {pab}, the
sought matrix M can be obtained by maximizing a like-
lihood function L[M] deﬁned as

L[M] =

fab ln[pab(M)]

Iab ln Tr[Π(a)MΠ(b)],

where pab(M) ≥ 0 for any physically acceptable process.
Equation (5) is the ﬁrst main result of this pa-
per.
It contains both experimental (Iab) and theoreti-
cal [pab(M)] quantities. Now, we demonstrate that it
is possible to impose the condition pab(M) ≥ 0 before
the maximization operation, in such a way that the esti-
mated Mueller matrix is automatically physically accept-
able. After a lengthy but straightforward calculation, it
is possible to show that the matrix M can be written in
terms of an Hermitian matrix H as [18]

composed by 16 real parameters hk, (k = 1, . . . , 16), and
we ﬁxed the normalization of H by setting M00 = 1.
Then, after substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (7), the maxi-
mum of L can be found by using a standard maximiza-
tion algorithm [19]. The search for the maximum is per-
formed in the real 16-dimensional space of parameters
{hk}. Once the optimal set of values {hopt
1 , . . . , hopt
16 }
that maximize L has been found, this can be used in Eq.
(8) to obtain the corresponding H opt. Finally, the ele-
ments of the sought physically acceptable Mueller matrix
can be computed as

Mµν = Tr nH opt[σ(µ) ⊗ σ∗

(ν)]o ,

(10)

where {σ(µ)} are the normalized Pauli matrices [18]. This
is our second main result. A Mueller matrix M deter-
mined in this way represents the answer to the question:
“which physically acceptable Mueller matrix is most likely
to yield the measured data? ”

The rest of the paper is devoted to the illustration of
the theory outlined above, by applying it to a realistic
case. We have chosen from the current literature [20] the
following Mueller matrix which was already shown [12]
to be physically unacceptable:

From M ′ we calculated the (normalized) associated Her-

it has one negative eigenvalue:

where we selected both the input beam (represented by
Π(b)) and the polarization ﬁlter (represented by Π(a))
from the set of 6 pure polarization states labelled as hor-
izontal (H) and vertical (V), oblique at 45◦ and oblique
at 135◦, right (RHC) and left (LHC). The so obtained
36 numbers represent our “experimental” data set. Ob-
viously, from these numbers one could generate back M ′
with the conventional linear algorithm. It may worth to
note that the three pairs of polarization states we have
chosen, are the ones usually employed in CPT [1], and
correspond to three mutually unbiased basis [21] often
utilized in QPT. We used the MATHEMATICA 5.1 func-
tion FindMaximum to maximize L. Tho run this func-
tion it is necessary to furnish a set of initial values for
the parameters {h1, . . . , h16} to be estimated. We found
convenient to proceed in the following way: we made
ﬁrst a polar decomposition of H ′ to obtain the positive
semideﬁnite matrix H ′′ = 2pH ′H ′†/TrpH ′H ′†, then
we obtain the initial values from the Cholesky decompo-
sition of H ′′. Finally, after maximization, we obtained
the maximum-likelihood estimation of M ML as

M ML =

0.0001 −0.0496

(14)
As expected, this matrix is indeed a physically acceptable
Mueller matrix, as the eigenvalues of its associated H ML
matrix are all non-negative:

A visual inspection show that M and M ML diﬀers only
by a little amount. This was expected since we choose
an initial Mueller matrix M ′ that is not very unphysical
(only one negative eigenvalue ). A quantitative estima-
tion of the diﬀerence between M ′ and M ML can be given
by calculating their relative Frobenius distance [10]

||M − M ML||
||M + M ML||

= 0.072,

(16)

which indicates that the average relative diﬀerence be-
tween corresponding matrix elements of M and M ML is

about 7%. This conﬁrms the quality of our approach
even with sparse data set (only 36 values).

In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to ap-
ply the maximum-likelihood method, initially developed
for quantum process tomography, to the classical prob-
lem of Mueller matrix reconstruction. Moreover, we have
shown that this method has the beneﬁt to produce always
physically acceptable Mueller matrices as the most likely
matrices which yield the measured data.

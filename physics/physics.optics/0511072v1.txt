We present a simple method to stabilize the optical path length of an optical ﬁber to an accuracy
of about 1/100 of the laser wavelength. We study the dynamic response of the path length to
modulation of an electrically conductive heater layer of the ﬁber. The path length is measured
against the laser wavelength by use of the Pound-Drever-Hall method; negative feedback is applied
via the heater. We apply the method in the context of a cryogenic resonator frequency standard.

INTRODUCTION

The transmission of light through optical ﬁbers is ubiq-
uitous in optics. However, ﬁbers are easily deformed.
Vibrations and temperature changes thus cause an un-
wanted modulation of the optical path length nL (where
n is the index of refraction of the ﬁber core and L the
mechanical length), thus phase modulating the transmit-
ted signal. Even for ﬁbers as short as a few meters under
quiet laboratory conditions, the phase ﬂuctuations easily
exceed 2π on a timescale of seconds. When using ﬁbers to
transmit light between laboratories or diﬀerent buildings,
the corresponding broadening of the spectrum reaches
several kHz [1]. At ﬁrst glance, this may appear negligi-
ble against the frequency of optical radiation. However,
the tremendous progress in optical frequency stabiliza-
tion has lead to lasers with a linewidth of one Hz and
below [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Such lasers are applied, for ex-
ample, in optical clocks [7, 8] and tests of fundamental
laws of physics [4]. Precision atomic physics experiments
10−8 rad2 relative phase
use phase-locked lasers having
variance [9]. It is clear that transmission of such signals
through ﬁbers most signiﬁcantly degrades their frequency
and phase stability.

Path length ﬂuctuations may also have considerable ef-
fects in other ﬁelds: For example, quantum cryptography
bridges distances exceeding 100 km by ﬁbers and is now
beginning to be a commercial technology. Fiber length
ﬂuctuations are important in this context, since some
concepts use interferometry to detect the quantum state
of photons [10]. For global frequency comparisons at
the targeted precision of next generation optical atomic
clocks (10−18), Doppler-shifts caused by the continental
1 cm per year) will have to be
drift (at a velocity of

controlled. Moreover, ﬁber length ﬂuctuations have been
identiﬁed as a limit on the frequency noise of optical comb
generators [11]. They also may play a role in space ex-
periments like the LISA und LISA Pathﬁnder missions,
which use Mach-Zehnder interferometers that have ﬁbers
in the interferometer arms. There is thus a strong and in-
creasing need for a simple and reliable method to remove
ﬁber path length ﬂuctuations.

Cancellation of the phase errors caused by such ﬂuctu-
ations has been demonstrated by L.-S. Ma, P. Jungner,
J. Ye, and J.L. Hall [1]. They use an acousto-optic mod-
ulator (AOM) to pre-modulate the ﬁber input with the
negative image of the phase ﬂuctuations, so that the ﬂuc-
tuations are cancelled at the ﬁber output. The ﬂuctua-
tions are measured by sending back a sample of the trans-
mitted signal and comparing it to the incident one. This
technique is applied in the operation, comparison and
improvement of optical frequency standards [12], tests
of fundamental physics [13], and may even be useful in
quantum optics and atomic physics experiments, includ-
ing quantum computing and cryptography [14].

In this paper, we describe the use of controlled heating
of (a part of) the ﬁber for stabilizing or modulating the
optical path length. It achieves a performance similar to
that of the method reported by Ma et al.. We directly
stabilize the path length itself rather than compensating
for the phase modulation caused by the ﬂuctuations. Our
method does not require the use of an AOM. This sim-
pliﬁes the setup and avoids the loss of the optical power
associated with the deﬂection eﬃciency of the AOM and
makes our method useful even for signals, which cannot
be transmitted through an AOM, such as the very broad-
band light found in optical comb generators.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we de-
scribe the dynamic response of the path length to the

heater. The setup and its performance are described in
section III. In Sec. IV, we show how the method was
used in an experiment on frequency stabilization in a
ﬁber-coupled cryogenic optical resonator (CORE).

II. DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE FIBER

Thermal time constants can easily be of the order of
minutes or longer. Thus, if heating is to be used as an ac-
tuator in a fast servo loop that achieves sub-wavelength
stability, the dynamic response of the path length to heat-
ing has to be considered carefully. Previous studies of the
static [15, 16] and the dynamic response [17, 18] assume
that the ﬁber surface is heated to a ﬁxed temperature
by an external thermal source. However, for fast tem-
perature changes, this assumption becomes unrealistic,
since the ﬁnite thermal conductivity of any material pre-
cludes the instantaneous application of a ﬁxed tempera-
ture. Rather, the dynamic characteristics of the thermal
source itself have to be taken into account. We discuss
the magnitude and the phase of the response, the latter
being of prime interest for the design of a servo loop.

In our model, the response of the path length nL is
given by changes in the index of refraction n and the
physical length L of the ﬁber core:

Our model of the ﬁber consists of up to three concentric
cylindrical layers (see Tables I and II): (i) the inner layer
(radius r1) represents both the ﬁber core and cladding.
Although they are doped to obtain slightly diﬀerent index
of refraction, the thermal and mechanical properties of
the two are alike, so in the thermal model they can be
considered as a single layer. (ii) A protective jacket of
outer radius r2, and (iii) a heater coating of outer radius
r3. (For the gold and aluminum coated ﬁbers, the coating
itself acts as the heater; therefore, r1 = r2 and there are
only two layers in the models for these ﬁbers.) The linear
coeﬃcients Ai and Bi and the material parameters (Tab.
II) for each layer are denoted by subscripts i that take the
values 1,2,3. They are ﬁxed by the boundary conditions
that the temperature and the heat ﬂow be smooth.

The last equation means that for now we assume no
heat dissipation to the environment, the eﬀects of which
will be discussed later. This system of linear algebraic
equations can be solved for the coeﬃcients Ai, Bi. Since
the solution is elementary but lengthy, we will not spell
it out here. The temperature of the core and thus
the associated path length change β∆T (0) are given by
∆T (0) = A1J0(1, 1).

The additional strain term is caused by thermal ex-
pansion, which leads to axial strain (i.e., length change)
[17, 18]. This changes the path length nL directly. (The
temperature changes also cause radial strain which leads
to a change in the phase velocity of light in the waveg-
uide [17, 18]. However, as this eﬀect contributes only
about 10% of the total eﬀect, we can negelect it here.)
Each inﬁnitesimal layer of the ﬁber wants to adjust its
length according to the local temperature. For alternat-
ing temperatures, the temperature distribution is inho-
mogenous; stress builds up, which propagates to other
layers at the speed of sound. For the time-scales relevant
here, we can assume instantaneous sound propagation.
Hence, the length of the ﬁber is then given by a balance
of forces

Here, α is the thermal expansion coeﬃcient and E the

The core temperature and the strain term have the same
sign for slow temperature variations. In what follows, we
study the path length change as given by these terms for
the ﬁbers listed in Tab. I.

a. Plastic-jacketed ﬁber The core temperature and
the strain term for this ﬁber is shown in Fig. 1 (left).
For better presentation in the ﬁgure, the amplitudes have
been multiplied by the frequency f .

−

For frequencies below about 1 Hz, the amplitudes of the
core temperature and the strain term are proportional to
90◦. This is because we neglect
1/f ; their phases equal
heat dissipation to the environment, which means that
the actual thermal energy within the ﬁber is the inte-
gral of the heating rate over time. In practice, this is a
good approximation for frequencies above about 0.1 Hz.
At lower frequencies, the temperature of the ﬁber will be
given by an equilibrium between heating and dissipation.
Thus, the frequency response of the strain and core tem-
perature terms will become constant below about 0.1 Hz.
The phase will then be 0◦. It is, of course, possible to
incorporate dissipation into the above model. However,
the heat dissipation is hard to quantify because of air
currents, Moreover, it is irrelevant for the design of the
ﬁber length feedback loop as it has signiﬁcant eﬀects only
for frequencies much below the loop bandwidth.

For frequencies above about 0.5 Hz, the magnitude of
both terms begins to drop, and the phase lags increase
correspondingly. For the core temperature term, this is
because fast temperature changes are attenuated on their
way to the core due to the ﬁnite thermal conductivity.
The core temperature term drops rapidly with increasing
frequency and gains a large phase shift, which exceeds
180◦ for frequencies as low as 1 Hz. This bandwidth is
much too low for an eﬀective removal of the path length
ﬂuctuations by a servo loop.

Study of the strain term ∆L, however, reveals a much
more favourable behaviour. Like the core temperature
term, it starts to drop for frequencies above about 0.5 Hz,
but only very mildly, proportional to 1/f 3/2. This be-
cause the strain term does not depend on the slow heat
diﬀusion to the core alone. Rather, strain generated in
the outer layers of the ﬁber, which are closer to the
heater,
is transmitted to the core at the velocity of
sound. The 1/√f roll oﬀ (in addition to the overall 1/f
one) arises because the depth to which the temperature
changes penetrate the ﬁber becomes thinner with increas-
ing frequency. This mild frequency response is crucial for

the performance of the servo: The 1/f 3/2 roll oﬀ at 135◦
total phase shift enables a fast and stable servo loop.

The actual frequency dependence of the strain term
shown in Fig. 1 (left) is a consequence of the very low
elastic modulus of the heater coating. A heater out of a
more rigid material will cause a diﬀerent, and even more
interesting, response. This is made evident in the case of
aluminum coated ﬁber, see below.

b. Aluminum-coated ﬁber Aluminum coated ﬁber,
where the Al coating is used as the heater, has a fre-
quency response which is even more suitable for the
present application, see Fig. 1 (middle). Apart from a
general 1/f response, the core temperature term begins
to roll-oﬀ at a frequency of f1
250 Hz, much larger than
for plastic jacket. This is because of the much larger ther-
mal conductivity of the Al coating as compared to acryl,
and because the Al coating as a heater attaches directly
to the core.

∼

The frequency response is again dominated by the
strain term. The major diﬀerence to the plastic-jacketed
ﬁber is that the strain term shows virtually no roll-oﬀ
other than the usual 1/f behaviour for all frequencies at
which the model is valid. This is because the Al coating
as a high elastic modulus, comparable to the one of the
quartz glass core. As the Al layer is much thicker than
the core, the stiﬀness of the ﬁber is almost completely
due to the Al heater layer. Heat is generated throughout
the volume of the Al coating, and there it causes strain
instantaneously. This strain is propagated to the core at
the high velocity of sound.

c. Bare, gold-coated ﬁber The frequency response of
ﬁber coated with a thin layer of gold is shown in Fig. 1
(right). The gold coating is used as the heater. The strain
term is not dominant at low frequencies (because the stiﬀ-
ness of the ﬁber is dominated by the quartz glass core,

with its low thermal expansion coeﬃcient), but overtakes
for larger frequencies. The magnitude of the strain term
depicts a roll-oﬀ of slightly less than 1/f for frequencies
between 100 and 10000 Hz. The reason can be explained
as follows: The thermal expansion coeﬃcient of quartz
glass is much lower than that of gold. Most stress is
thus generated in the thin gold coating, and the result-
ing strain is reduced by the core due to its low thermal
expansion coeﬃcient. At low frequencies, the core also
takes away a signiﬁcant fraction of the thermal energy,
thus reducing the amplitude of the temperature in the
heater volume, thereby reducing the generated stress. At
high frequencies, however, the ﬁnite thermal conductivity
reduces the heat transfer to the core, so that the temper-
ature variation is no longer reduced by heat transfer.

d. Discussion The phase modulation depth that can
be achieved by heating is limited by the permissible tem-
perature and hence the power dissipation of the heater.
Assuming a very moderate heater power of 1 W per meter
of ﬁber length, we obtain a modulation depth of about
2.4 µm/m, 8 µm/m, and 4 µm/m for plastic-, aluminum-,
and gold-coated ﬁber at 1 Hz, respectively. The higher
values are obtained for the aluminum- and gold-coated
ﬁbers, where this ﬁgure drops like 1/f (For the plastic-
jacketed ﬁber, it drops with 1/f 3/2).

The validity of the above model is limited at higher fre-
quencies, since we assumed instantaneous sound propaga-
tion. Sound, however, propagates at a velocity of several
1000 m/s. For a ﬁber radius of 400 µm, this means that
ﬁber will deviate from the above model on a time scale
of the order of 0.1 µs, or frequencies of a few MHz. Since
the additional delay due to the ﬁnite velocity will increase
the phase lag at high frequencies, this represents a theo-
retical limit on the speed of any feedback loop based on
heating of a ﬁber. In view of the very limited modulation

amplitude that can be reached at such high frequencies,
however, heating of the ﬁber cannot take out a distur-
bance of any appreciable amplitude at such frequencies,
even if the linearized feedback loop would theoretically
be stable.

III. APPARATUS

A. Overview

The basic setup is shown in ﬁgure 2. For reading out
the instantaneous length of the ﬁber, we use the method
developed by Pound, Drever, and Hall [19] for reading out
the resonance frequency of a resonant cavity. Indeed, the
ﬁber with its about 4% parasitic reﬂection at each end re-
sembles a Fabry-Perot etalon, although one with a quite
low ﬁnesse. A frequency modulated Nd:YAG laser light
at 1064 nm is sent through the ﬁber. The modulation
frequency is fm = 500 kHz with a modulation index of
about 1 (however, these parameters are not critical for
the performance of the active length control). From the
output of the ﬁber, we split oﬀ a sample and detect its
intensity. Alternatively, the detector can be placed at
the input of the ﬁber. This makes the setup extremely
simple, as no additional components are required at the
remote end of the ﬁber.

Due to the frequency modulation (FM), the laser ra-
diation acquires additional Fourier components at fre-
fm (“sidebands”), where fl is the laser fre-
quencies fl ±
quency. For pure FM, the phase relationship between
these components is such that the amplitude of the sig-
nal is unaﬀected. The resonant and dispersive properties
of the ﬁber alter these phase relationships. In general,
this converts the pure frequency modulation into ampli-
tude modulation (AM) components at multiples of ωm.
When the laser and the resonance frequency coincide, the
detected component of the AM vanishes; if they are de-
tuned, however, a nonzero AM is found, whose amplitude
indicates the magnitude and whose phase relative to the
FM indicates the direction of the detuning. The detector
signal is multiplied with a local oscillator (LO) signal at
fm in a double-balanced mixer (DBM), and the output of
the DBM is low-pass ﬁltered to suppress the modulation
frequency. With the correct LO phase φ, a error signal is
thus generated that indicates the deviation of the optical
path length of the ﬁber relative to a multiple of half the
laser wavelength.

This signal serves as input to a proportional-integral
servo, which controls the ﬁber length by heating a part
of the ﬁber. For determining the gain and time constants
of the servo, we use the results of our above study of the
dynamic response of the ﬁber (Fig. 1). Since a servo
loop is stable for a 1/f 3/2 roll oﬀ with a corresponding
phase shift of 135 degrees, it can operate throughout the
frequency range discussed in the above model.

The most suitable ﬁber would be the aluminum-
jacketed or gold-coated ones (Tab. I). The most unde-

FIG. 2: Basic setup for active length control of an optical
ﬁber: The frequency modulated laser light is sent through
the ﬁber and detected by a photodetector. Demodulation
with the modulation frequency yields an error signal, that is
used by a servo to drive a heater in order to compensate for
ﬂuctuations in length. It is also possible to place the detector
and beamsplitter to the input side of the ﬁber.

sirable one, from the point of view of high servo speed, is
plastic-jacketed ﬁber, because the plastic jacket is thick
and has poor thermal conductivity. The results of the
previous section, however, show that even in this case
loop bandwidths of several 100 Hz can be achieved.

To demonstrate that even in this case a satisfactory
performance can be obtained, we used a 5 m long polar-
ization maintaining ﬁber with plastic jacket (Thor labs
type FS-PM-4511). We tried two diﬀerent methods to
attach a heater layer to it: A manganine wire wrapped
around the ﬁber did not work because of the bad thermal
contact between the wire and the ﬁber. Much better con-
tact was obtained by coating the ﬁber with electrically
conductive silver varnish on a length of 30 cm.

To examine the length stability of the ﬁber, we moni-
tor the error signal with the servo loop open and closed,
which yields a measurement of the actuator-limited per-
formance of the servo loop (Errors in the ﬁber length
sensing by the Pound-Drever-Hall method are not neces-
sarily revealed in this measurement, but should be negli-
gible here.) Without stabilization, the ﬂuctuations reach
up to 0.5µm/√Hz at 1 Hz and increase proportionally to
1/f 2 for lower frequencies. Fig. 3 does only show this for
frequencies above 1 Hz, because the length readout pro-
vided by the Pound-Drever Hall method is restricted to
a range of λ/2. Applying active length stabilization, the
ﬂuctuations are reduced below 8 nm/√Hz for frequencies
below about 1 Hz, and below 1 nm√Hz above 1 Hz. The
ﬂuctuations integrated over the frequency range of Fig.
3 are about 10 nm, or λ/100.

Given the simplicity of our setup, these results compare
well to those due to Ma et al. [1]: For 25 m of ﬁber, within
a frequency band of
2 kHz, they suppressed the
−
phase noise to a level of -60 dBc/Hz, corresponding to
1 nm/√Hz. The
residual length ﬂuctuations below
noise is increasing to 1 µm/√Hz at 0.1 Hz, but this is
a very conservative value, as Ma et al.
infer it directly
from a beat measurement between the incident and the
transmitted light. Although the bandwidth of our lock

achieves a similar performance for low and medium fre-
quencies.

In many cases, the frequency modulation used for read-
ing out the path length will not interfere with the in-
tended application of the ﬁber’s output signal. The side-
bands form separate components in frequency space; in a
frequency comparison by taking a beat note with another
optical signal, for example, they can be removed by elec-
tronic ﬁltering. Its eﬀects can be reduced by using a low
modulation index and by choosing a suitable modulation
frequency.

The coating with silver varnish turned out to be un-
suitable for a long term usage. Occasionally, it breaks at
its weakest point, which makes further length controlling
impossible. Although the defect can easily be repaired
and the ﬁber itself does not suﬀer any damage, a reliable
long-term performance requires a more stable solution,
like using of aluminum-jacketed ﬁber (Tab. I).

IV. APPLICATION WITHIN A CRYOGENIC
RESONATOR FREQUENCY STANDARD

We applied the method in an optical frequency stan-
dards based on a Nd:YAG laser stabilized to a cryogenic
optical resonator (CORE), see ﬁgure 4. This consists of
an oscillator, a monolithic, diode-pumped neodymium-
YAG laser, frequency stabilized to a CORE located in-
side a liquid helium cryostat. The frequency stabilization
uses the Pound-Drever-Hall method using a photodetec-
tor that detects the light that is reﬂected from the core
(Fig., 4, above). In previous work, tis system was shown
to reach a Hz-level stability on a timescale of seconds.

An optical ﬁber is used for coupling the laser light to
the cavity (Fig. 4). While this made the system more
stable on timescales of hours [20, 21], on short timescales,
however, the frequency stability with ﬁber coupling is re-
duced due to path length ﬂuctuations. These introduce

6

phase ﬂuctuations as described above, as they shift the
laser frequency relative to the CORE resonance. Addi-
tionally, since the ﬁber with parasitic reﬂections at its
ends acts like a Fabry-Perot etalon,
it adds parasitic
signal components into the Pound-Drever-Hall error sig-
nal used for feeding back to the laser frequency. These
change from maximum to minimum for a λ/4 length
change of the ﬁber and cause an unwanted ﬂuctuation
of the baseline of the error signal (Fig. 5 (above)), which
have been found to lead to ﬂuctuations of the Nd:YAG
laser frequency of 8 Hz amplitude.

To remove both the Doppler eﬀect and this modula-
tion, we lock the path length of the ﬁber to the Nd:YAG
laser’s wavelength using the method described above: A
photodetector located inside the cryostat (Fig. 4, below)
is used to read out the ﬁber length ﬂuctuations. Its signal
is downconverted with the laser modulation frequency to
generate an error signal for reading out the ﬁber length.
It is fed back to the heater via a proportional-integral
controller. The ﬁber and the heater are of the same type
as described above.

Figure 5 illustrates the eﬀect of ﬁber-length stabiliza-
tion. Above is shown the error signal without active ﬁber
length stabilization, measured by scaning the laser fre-
quency over a range of about 150 MHz. Note the base-
line ﬂuctuations caused by the parasitic etalon due to
the ﬁber with a free spectral range of about 50 MHz. Ac-
tive ﬁber length control tracks the ﬁber length accord-
ing to the actual laser wavelength and removes these ef-
fects (Fig. 5 (below)). For the 150 MHz laser frequency
sweep, the ﬁber length changes by about 2.5 µm to track
the ﬁber length to the actual laser wavelength. Thus,
the ﬁber is always operated with maximum transmission,
where the front and the back reﬂex cancel. A straight
baseline free from the etalon fringes seen in Fig. 5 (above)
and a constant signal amplitude at maximum value are
obtained. The speed of the servo loop made it possible
to track the laser wavelength even while it was scanned
at a rate of about 10 Hz.

Additionally, the error signal used for stabilizing the
laser frequency can be improved by introducing a frac-
tion of the “ﬁber”-detector’s signal into the path of the
“CORE” detector. Adjusting the amplitude an phase re-
lationships between the two carefully, an additional can-
cellation of the unwanted signal components due to the
ﬁber can be achieved.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have presented a method to reduce ﬂuctuations of
the optical path length of optical ﬁbers to below 10 nm
by controlled heating of part of the ﬁber. A theoretical
study of the response of the optical path length to heat
dissipated in the bulk of a heater layer indicates that
servo bandwidths in the kHz range, or indeed even the
low MHz range, can be obtained. The high speed is be-
cause strain propagates in the ﬁber at the speed of sound,

which is a much faster process than heat diﬀusion. The
most suitable ﬁbers for this purpose are bare ﬁber with
a thin gold coating for resistive heating, or aluminum
jacketed one.

We also present a ﬁrst experimental demonstration of
the method. It uses a conductive coating made of silver
varnish on a plastic-jacketed ﬁber. We used this method
in the context of an optical frequency standard based on
a cryogenic optical resonator.

Compared to previous work, our method has the ad-
vantage of simplicity. Moreover, since it directly removes
the path length ﬂuctuations, it can reduce the phase noise
induced by such ﬂuctuations for any signals, even those
for which acousto-optic modulators are not suitable, like
the broadband optical signals in optical frequency comb
generators.

The simple realization of the presented idea for an ac-
tive stabilization leaves plenty of space for further de-
velopments. Use of aluminum-jacketed ﬁber can enhance
the reliability and also increses the useful lock bandwidth
signiﬁcantly. This leads to better stability of the stabi-
lized path length. Another approach could be to try a
bare ﬁber coated with a gold layer as a heater, which
would lead to even better performance. We expect that
the method can soon be routinely applied in many appli-
cations mentioned in the introduction, that require the
transmission of an optical signal through ﬁber with ex-
ceptional stability.

We introduce the concept of subwavelength imaging with an opaque nonlinear left-handed lens
by generating the second-harmonic ﬁeld. We consider a slab of composite left-handed metamaterial
with quadratic nonlinear response and show that such a ﬂat lens can form, under certain conditions,
an image of the second-harmonic ﬁeld of the source being opaque at the fundamental frequency.

One of the most unique properties of the recently
demonstrated left-handed metamaterials, i.e. materials
with simultaneously negative real parts of dielectric per-
mittivity and magnetic permeability [1], is their ability to
focus electromagnetic waves by a ﬂat slab of the material,
the property which makes these materials quite diﬀerent
from the conventional optical lenses with the positive re-
fractive index needed to have curved surfaces to form an
image. Recently, Pendry [2] argued that a slab of a loss-
less left-handed material with ǫ = µ = −1 should behave
like a perfect lens enabling to obtain an ideal image of a
point source through the ampliﬁcation of the evanescent
components of the ﬁeld.

While recent experimental demonstrations conﬁrmed
the main features of negative refraction of the left-handed
materials [3, 4], the question of near-perfect imaging by
ﬂat lens and near-ﬁeld focusing still remain highly con-
troversial [5], and it severely constrained because of large
dissipation and dispersion of metamaterials. Neverthe-
less, numerical studies indicate [6] that nearly-perfect
imaging should be expected even under realistic condi-
tions when both dispersion and losses of the left-handed
composites are taken into account. More importantly,
some of the properties of the left-handed materials, such
as negative refraction, have been predicted [7] and re-
cently demonstrated experimentally [8] in photonic crys-
tals, which are inhomogeneous periodic structures with
a lattice constant comparable to the wavelength. This
negative refraction allows considerable control over light
propagation, and it opens up doors for new applications
of microstructured materials and the extension of the ba-
sic concepts from microwaves to optical frequencies.

Until now, all properties of ﬂat lenses and subwave-
length imaging have been studied only for linear waves.
However, it has been already noticed that the left-handed
metamaterials may possess quite complicated nonlinear
magnetic response [9], or properties of such materials
can be altered by inserting diodes in the resonators of
the composite structure thus making the response of the
entire material nonlinear [10]. In this Letter, we make
one step forward into this direction and study the eﬀects
of the second-harmonic generation and subwavelength
imaging by a nonlinear left-handed lens. In particular, we

analyze the imaging properties of a slab of metamaterial
with quadratic nonlinear response and demonstrate, both
analytically and numerically, that such a slab can form
an image of the second-harmonic ﬁeld of the source being
opaque at the fundamental frequency. This can happen
under certain conditions, which include Pendry’s condi-
tions of a perfect lens satisﬁed for the second-harmonic
ﬁeld, ǫ(2ω) = µ(2ω) = −1, leading to the conditions for
ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) being of the opposite signs at the funda-
mental frequency ω. More importantly, for the case of
two sources we show that the resolution of such a nonlin-
ear left-handed ﬂat lens can be made indeed better than
the radiation wavelength.

We consider a lens in the form of a layer of left-handed
metamaterial with the thickness D, as shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 1. We assume that the metamaterial is a
three-dimensional composite structure made of wires and
split-ring resonators (SRRs) in the form of a cubic lat-
tice. When the lattice period d is much smaller than
the radiation wavelength λ, i.e. d ≪ λ, this composite
structure can be described within the eﬀective-medium
approximation, and it can be characterized by dielectric
permittivity and magnetic permeability which, for the
speciﬁc structure and in the linear regime can be derived
consistently and can be written in the form

and for γe, γm ≪ ω, such a composite structure demon-
strates left-handed transmission, whereas for ω < ω0, it
is opaque because the signs of ǫ and µ are opposite.

FIG. 1: Schematic of the problem. Electromagnetic waves
emitted by a source (located at z = −zs) are reﬂected from
an opaque slab of a left-handed material. Inside the slab, the
exponentially decaying ﬁeld at the fundamental frequency ω
generates the second-harmonic ﬁeld at 2ω, which penetrates
through the slab creating an image at the second harmonics.

In order to achieve a nonlinear response in such a struc-
ture, we assume that each SRR includes a nonlinear el-
ement, e.g. a diode inserted in the SRR [10].
If the
diode has an asymmetric current-voltage characteristics,
the unit cell does not possess a center of symmetry with
respect to the ﬁeld direction, and the resulting nonlinear
response should include, in particular, the second har-
monic of the source frequency.

Our idea is to satisfy the perfect-lens conditions for the
second-harmonic waves and, therefore, we take µ(2ω) =
ǫ(2ω) = −1. From Eqs. (1), (2) we can ﬁnd that these
conditions can be satisﬁed provided

ǫ(ω) = −7,

µ(ω) = (3 − F )/(3 − 2F ).

(3)

For this choice of the material parameters, the slab is
opaque at the fundamental frequency ω, and the waves do
not penetrate into it. However, the nonlinear quadratic
response of the material can allow the process of the
second-harmonic generation. Since the material is trans-
parent at the frequency 2ω, we expect that the second-
harmonic ﬁeld can propagate through the slab creating
an image of the source behind the ﬂat lens.

Using the so-called undepleted pump approximation,
we can obtain the equation for the TM-polarized second-
harmonic ﬁeld H (2ω)
(x, z) inside the slab, which has the
form well-known in the theory of the second-harmonic
generation (see e.g. Ref. [11])

Substituting the explicit expressions for ǫ(ω) and µ(ω)
from Eq. (3) into Eq. (10), we obtain a simple estimate for
an expected resolution limit of the nonlinear left-handed
lens in terms of the critical (limiting) wavenumber,

γ2
lim ≈ 1 +

(3 − F )
7(3 − 2F )

.

(11)

However, the existence of this critical wavenumber does
not necessarily limits the lens resolution and, in reality,
the eﬀect of surface waves on the imaging properties of
the nonlinear lens depends on the eﬃciency of their ex-
citation by each particular source.

Analytical solution of the problem for the spatial spec-
trum of the second-harmonic ﬁeld transmitted through
the left-handed slab can be obtained for narrow enough
spectrum of the source, i.e., when the width of the source
spectrum at the fundamental frequency does not exceed
the value γc, where

γ2
c ≈ |ǫ(ω)µ(ω)|.

(12)

Then, we can use the impedance boundary conditions for
the fundamental ﬁeld at the interface between vacuum
and the metamaterial slab at z = 0. Subsequent numeri-
cal results indicate that this approximation remains valid
provided γc ≫ γlim.

To solve the problem analytically, we assume that the
wave at the fundamental frequency ω penetrates inside
the slab on a distance (the skin layer) much smaller
than the slab thickness D, i.e. Dδ ≫ 1, where δ =
k0
−ǫ(ω)µ(ω). Taking into account the actual values
of ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) (3), one can see that the fundamental
frequency penetration depth, ∼ (2πδ)−1, does not exceed
λ/17. Then, Eq. (6) can be re-written in the form

Thus, the squared ﬁeld at the fundamental frequency
acts as an eﬀective source of the second-harmonic ﬁeld
and, as a result, the image of the squared ﬁeld is re-
produced by the nonlinear left-handed lens. This image
appears at the point zim = D − zs, and this result co-
incides with the corresponding result for the linear lens
discussed earlier [2].

For the objects with the spatial scale larger or equal to
the radiation wavelength, the second-harmonic ﬁeld pro-
ﬁle coincides with the intensity of the fundamental ﬁeld
generated by the source, as shown in Fig. 2(a).

However, when the source contains the spatial scales
less than the radiation wavelength, the imaging proper-
ties of the nonlinear lens depend strongly on the slab
thickness D. As an example, in Fig. 2(b) we show the
results for the transmission of an incident Gaussian beam
of the width λ/10 which reproduces almost exactly the
source proﬁle at the image plane in the case of a thin
lens (dashed line) but generates a strongly distorted im-
age when the slab thickness becomes larger than a half
of the wavelength λ. Distortions appear as periodic vari-
ation of the second-harmonic ﬁeld being caused by ex-
Intensity distribution of the
citation of surface waves.
magnetic ﬁeld in the fundamental and second-harmonic
ﬁelds are shown in Figs. 3(a-d) for (a,b) large and (c,d)
small (compared to the radiation wavelength) size of the
source, respectively.

Figure 2(c) shows the numerical results for imaging
of two sources that generate the Gaussian beams with
the maxima separated by the distance λ/5 in the trans-
verse direction. Again, the image reproduces very well
the source for a thinner lens, and therefore a thin nonlin-
ear lens does provide a subwavelength resolution of the
second-harmonic ﬁeld. In contrast to the linear ﬂat lens,
the resolution of the nonlinear lens depends on the dis-
tance zs between the source and the lens, and the optimal
distance can be determined separately for each particular
case.

In conclusion, we have studied the second-harmonic
generation and subwavelength imaging by a nonlin-
ear left-handed lens, i.e. a slab of metamaterial with
quadratic nonlinear response. We have demonstrated,
both analytically and numerically, that such a slab can
form an image of the second-harmonic ﬁeld of the source
being opaque at the fundamental frequency, with the res-
olution that can be made indeed better than the radiation
wavelength.

(a,b) Wide beam (D = 5λ,
zs = 2.5λ, and a0 = λ) and (c,d) narrow beam (D = λ/5,
zs = λ/10, and a0 = λ/4). Solid lines mark the ﬂat sur-
faces of the nonlinear left-handed lens. Dashed lines show the
predicted locations of the second-harmonic image.

When the size of the source is comparable or less than
the wavelength λ of the fundamental-frequency wave, the
problem cannot be treated analytically, and Eq. (4) has
been solved numerically. In Figs. 2(a-c), we present our
numerical results for the intensity distribution of the in-
cident beam at the source point and the ﬁeld distribution
of the second-harmonic beam at the image location, nor-
malized to the ﬁeld maxima. The actual amplitude of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld at the image location is lower
than the amplitude of the source because of a ﬁnite eﬃ-
ciency of the process of the second-harmonic generation.

Abstract

We present ultrafast all-optical switching measurements of Si woodpile photonic band gap crys-

tals at telecom frequencies. The crystals are homogeneously excited by a two-photon process. We

probe the switching by measuring reﬂectivity over broad frequency ranges as a function of time.

At short delay times, we observe that the photonic gap becomes narrower than in the unswitched

case. After 1 ps, the complete gap has shifted to higher frequencies. This intricate behavior is

the result of competing refractive index changes due to the electronic Kerr eﬀect and to optically

excited free carriers. The frequency shift of the band gap as a function of pump intensity agrees

well with Fourier modal method calculations with no freely adjustable parameters.

Currently many eﬀorts are devoted to a novel class of dielectric composites known as

photonic crystals [1]. Spatially periodic variations of the refractive index commensurate with

optical wavelengths cause the photon dispersion relation to organize in bands, analogous to

electron bands in solids. Generally, frequency windows known as stop gaps appear in which

modes are forbidden for speciﬁc propagation directions. Fundamental interest in photonic

crystals is spurred by the possibility of a photonic band gap, a frequency range for which no

modes exist at all. Tailoring of the photonic density of states by a photonic crystal allows

one to control fundamental atom-radiation interactions in solid-state environments [2, 3].

In this context the hallmark of a photonic band gap is the eagerly awaited full inhibition of

spontaneous emission due to a vanishing density of states [2]. Additional interest is aroused

by the possibility of Anderson localization of light by defects added to photonic band gap

crystals [4].

Exciting prospects arise when photonic band gap crystals are switched on ultrafast

timescales. In particular, switching photonic band gap crystals provides dynamic control

over the density of states that would allow the switching-on or -oﬀ of light sources in the

band gap [5]. Furthermore, switching would allow the capture or release of photons from

photonic band gap cavities [5], which is relevant to solid-state slow-light schemes [6]. Switch-

ing directional properties of photonic crystals also leads to fast changes in the reﬂectivity,

where interesting changes have been reported for Bragg stacks [7, 8], 2D photonic crystals

[9, 10], and ﬁrst-order stop bands of 3D self-assembled crystals [11, 12]. Ultrafast control

of the propagation of light is essential to applications in active photonic integrated circuits

[13].

In this Letter, we present ultrafast all-optical switching measurements of Si woodpile

photonic band gap crystals at telecom frequencies. The crystals are homogeneously excited

by a two-photon process. We probe the switching by measuring reﬂectivity over broad

frequency ranges as a function of time. At short delay times <200 fs, we observe that the

photonic gap becomes narrower than in the unswitched case. After 1 ps, the complete gap

has shifted to higher frequencies. This intricate behavior is the result of competing refractive

index changes due to the electronic Kerr eﬀect and to optically excited free carriers. Our

experiments are compared to Fourier modal method calculations with no freely adjustable

parameters [14]. The measured and calculated frequency shift of the band gap as a function

of pump intensity are found to agree well.

The average lateral distance between two consecutive rods is 650 ± 10 nm. The arrows indicate

the (010) and the (100) direction of the woodpile crystal.

Inset: side view of the crystal. The

width and thickness of each rod is 175 ± 10 nm and 155 ± 10 nm respectively.

The Si woodpile photonic crystals are made using a layer-by-layer approach and are

designed to have a photonic band gap around the telecommunication wavelength of 1.55 µm

[15, 16]. The crystals consist of ﬁve layers of stacked poly-crystalline Si nano rods that have

a refractive index of 3.45 at 1.55 µm. High resolution scanning electron micrographs of a

crystal are shown in Fig. 1. While each second rod in the crystal is slightly displaced by 50

nm, this periodic perturbation and the resulting superstructure do not aﬀect the photonic

band gap region [17]. Our measurements were reproduced on multiple diﬀerent crystals.

A successful optical switching experiment requires an as large as possible switching mag-

nitude, ultrafast time-scales, as low as possible induced absorption, as well as good spatial

3

homogeneity [5]. In Si woodpile photonic crystals, optimum switching conditions are ob-
tained for pump frequencies near the two-photon absorption edge of Si ω/c= 5000 cm−1

(λ= 2000 nm) [18]. Switching experiments at such low pump frequencies require a laser
system that produces pulses with intensities of up to 100 GWcm−2. The setup used in our

experiments consists of a regeneratively ampliﬁed Ti:Saph laser (Spectra Physics Hurricane)

which drives two independently tunable optical parametric ampliﬁers (OPA, Topas). The
OPAs have a continuously tunable output frequency between 3850 and 21050 cm−1, with

pulse durations of 150 fs and a pulse energy Epulse of at least 20 µJ. The maximum pump
intensities that can be achieved in this setup exceed 1 TWcm−2, suﬃcient for our switching

experiments. The E-ﬁeld of the probe beam is polarized along the (-110) direction of the
crystal, incident at normal incidence θ= 0◦, and is focused to a Gaussian spot of 24 µm
FWHM at a small numerical aperture NA= 0.02. The pump beam is incident at θ= 15◦,

and has a much larger Gaussian focus of 113 µm FWHM than the probe, providing good

lateral spatial homogeneity. We ensure that only the central ﬂat part of the pump focus is

probed. The reﬂectivity was calibrated by referencing to a gold mirror. A versatile mea-

surement scheme was developed to subtract pump background from the probe reﬂectance

signal, and to compensate for possible pulse-to-pulse intensity variations in the output of

our laser [19].

Linear reﬂectivity measurements of the crystal are presented as open squares in Fig. 2.
The broad stop band from 5600 to 8800 cm−1 corresponds to the Γ-X stop gap in the band

structure, which is part of the 3D photonic band gap of Si woodpile photonic crystals [14, 15].

The large width conﬁrms that the crystals interact strongly with the light, conﬁrming band

gap behavior. While the crystals are relatively thin, the strong interaction and the excellent

crystal quality result in the high reﬂectivity of 95%. For comparison, Si inverse opal photonic

structures have typically lower reﬂectivity. The small discontinuities in the spectrum appear

at the limits of the scanning range of the diﬀerent signal types of our OPA and are probably

due to a slight beam walk oﬀ. The OPA spectra were well reproduced on diﬀerent positions

on the crystal surface and with a white light spectrometry setup. The dashed curve in Fig.

2 represents an Fourier modal method calculation of the reﬂectivity in the (001) direction

[14]. The measured Si rod dimensions, the displacements of individual layers, as well as the

superstructure were included in our model. The good agreement between our measurements

and the theory is remarkable since no parameters were freely adjusted, and in view of

FIG. 2: (color online) Linear (squares) and switched (circles) reﬂectivity spectra measured in the

(001) direction. A broad stop band with a maximum reﬂectivity of 95% appears for frequencies
between 5640 cm−1 and 8840 cm−1. They gray areas indicate the edges of the scanning ranges of
our OPA. The arrow indicates the pump frequency ωpump= 5000 cm−1. The pump peak intensity
was I0= 26 ± 1 GWcm−2 on the red part, I0= 28 ± 1 GWcm−2 on the central part, and I0= 26 ± 1
GWcm−2 on the blue part of the spectrum. The switched spectra were measured at a pump-probe

time delay of 1 ps on the red part, 300 fs on the central part and 1.5 ps on the blue part of the

spectrum. The dashed curve represents an Fourier modal method calculation that agree well with

the linear measurements in the band gap region.

averaging over the laser bandwidth.

In Fig. 2, the red circles show the reﬂectivity 1.5 ps after switching the crystal with a
laser pulse with peak intensity I0= 28 ± 1 GWcm−2. This spectrum clearly reveals that the
complete spectrum is blue-shifted by as much as 120 cm−1, with decreases on the red edge

5

and increases on the blue edge of the gap. The high reﬂectivity in the gap conﬁrms that

the induced absorption is low, and thus that the switched crystal remains transparent, as

opposed to some previous results [11]. From I0 and the two-photon absorption coeﬃcient
β= 0.2 cmGW−1 [20], we deduce a large pump absorption length ℓpump= 1/βI0= 0.18 cm,

or 2600 lattice spacings. This result conﬁrms that two-photon absorption yields much more

homogeneously switched crystals than one-photon absorption [18].

FIG. 3: (color) Diﬀerential reﬂectivity as a function of both probe frequency and probe delay. The

probe delay was varied from -500 to 1250 fs in steps of ∆t= 50 fs. The probe wavelength was tuned

from 1620 to 1900 nm in ∆λ= 10 nm steps in the low-frequency range, from 1160 to 1600 nm in the

central range, and from 900 nm to 1150 nm in 5 nm steps in the high-frequency range. The pump
intensity was I0= 27 ± 1 GWcm−2 on the red part, I0= 28 ± 1 GWcm−2 on the central part,
and I0= 29 ± 1 GWcm−2 on the blue part. In the central part of the stop band, ∆R/R(ω) was

measured at both negative delays and a delay of 300 fs. The red curves indicate ﬁxed frequency

curves along which delay traces were measured at both short and long delays, see Fig. 4

The independent tunability of our probe laser allows to for the ﬁrst time scan the re-

ﬂectivity spectrum as a function of frequency at a chosen time delay after the pump pulse.

The temporal evolution at ultrafast time scales of the diﬀerential reﬂectivity of the crystal

∆R/R is represented as a three-dimensional surface plot in Fig. 3 as a function of time
delay and probe frequency. At low frequencies near 6000 cm−1, the reﬂectivity displays an

6

ultrafast decrease ∆R/R= -8% indicative of a shift of the red edge of the stop band to higher
frequencies. At intermediate frequencies near 7000 cm−1, the peak reﬂectivity of the stop

band decreases by less than ∆R/R= -1%, conﬁrming that the induced absorption in the
structure is small. At high frequencies >8000 cm−1, we observe intricate temporal behavior:

near zero delay, a brief 200 fs decrease in reﬂectivity (∆R/R= -5%) is followed by either a

further decrease or by a strong increase up to ∆R/R= 25%, depending on ω. The decrease

at zero delay is attributed to the electronic Kerr eﬀect, and was used to correct our temporal

calibration for dispersion in the probe path. The decrease followed by an increase at 9170
cm−1 indicates that the photonic gap becomes narrow at short times, followed by a blue
shifting of the complete gap at longer times. At probe frequencies near 9400 cm−1, strong

variations in ∆R/R with frequency are related to the shift of the superstructure feature at
ω= 9400 cm−1 (see Fig. 2), and provide additional evidence of a large change in refractive

index.

To study the intricate ultrafast behavior in more detail, we have measured time traces

at two characteristic frequencies, namely the red and blue edge of the stop band, that are

indicated by the red traces in Fig. 3. The time delay curves of the calibrated absolute

reﬂectivity change ∆R in Fig. 4 are measured over an extended range. At the blue edge,

a rapid decrease to ∆R= -1% appears within 190 fs, followed after 80 fs by an increase

to ∆R= 5% within 500 fs. The eﬀect decays exponentially with a decaytime of 18 ± 1

ps. The reﬂectivity at the red edge decreases by ∆R= -12% within 1 ps. At delay times

longer than 2.5 ps after the excitation, the eﬀect on the red edge decays exponentially to

∆R= -1% with a decay time of 16 ± 2 ps. The decay times of about 18 ps are much

faster than carrier relaxation times in bulk Si, likely since our photonic crystals are made

of a poly-crystalline material, in which lattice defects and grain boundaries act as eﬃcient

carrier recombination traps [22]. This relatively fast decay time implies that switching could

potentially be repeated at a rate above 25 GHz, which is relevant to possible future switching

and modulation applications.

The measured frequency shift of the blue edge of the stop band at 9100 cm−1 is plotted
2 in ﬁgure 5. We have also plotted the frequency shift
versus peak pump power squared I0
of the reﬂectivity feature at 9750 cm−1. Both features shift approximately linearly with

the peak pump power squared, which conﬁrms that two-photon absorption is indeed the

dominant excitation mechanism. A large maximum shift of the stop band edge ∆ω/ω=

Drude model, which is valid for electron densities in the range of our experiments Neh ≤
1.5×1019 cm−3 [23]. We ﬁnd good agreement between our measurements and the theory

in particular since no parameters were adjusted. We deduce a large maximum change in

refractive index ∆n/nSi= 0.7% in the Si backbone. The physical interpretation of diamond

like structures, in which the photonic band gap appears in the ﬁrst order stop gap region,

is much simpler compared Si inverse opals where the band gap is expected in the range of

second order Bragg diﬀraction where complex multiple Bragg wave coupling must be taken

We have presented ultrafast all-optical switching measurements of thin Si woodpile pho-

tonic band gap crystals at telecom frequencies. The optical properties of a switched photonic

crystal are for the ﬁrst time probed as a continuous function of both frequency and delay

time (see Fig. 3). These features allow us to observe at short times a narrowing of the

9

gap and at longer times of 1 ps a blue-shift of the gap. In other words, the blue edge of

the gap shifts to lower frequency within the duration of the pulse, and subsequently shifts

to higher frequency compared to the unswitched situation while the red edge only shifts to

higher frequency. Consequently, the density of states near the blue edge of the band gap

behaves more complex than predicted [5]:

instead of single jumps as a function of time,

multiple jumps could occur with time diﬀerences governed by the duration of the pump

pulse. Clearly, versatile temporal control of the photonic density of states is expected to

open exciting opportunities both in fundamental physics and in advanced applications.

[19] The intensity of each pump and probe pulse is monitored by two InGaAs photodiodes. The

reﬂectivity signal is measured by a third photodiode (InGaAs or InAs). A boxcar averager

holds the short output pulses of each detector for 1 ms, allowing simultaneous acquisition

of separate pulse events of all three detector channels. Both pump and probe beam pass

through a chopper whose frequency is synchronized to the repetition rate f =1 kHz of the

laser. The alignment of the two beams on the chopper blade is such that each millisecond,

pump and probe beam are blocked or unblocked in a diﬀerent permutation. In one sequence of

four consecutive laser pulses, both pumped reﬂectivity, linear reﬂectivity, and two background

measurements are collected. The pump-probe delay was set by a 40 cm long delay line with

a resolution of 10 fs. At each frequency-delay setting, all detector signals from 4x250 pulse

events were collected and stored to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. From the resulting

large data set, background was subtracted, and each reﬂectance signal was referenced to the

corresponding monitor signal to compensate for intensity variations in the output of the laser.

Abstract

The smaller the size of a light-emitting microcavity, the more im-
portant it becomes to understand the eﬀects of the cavity boundary
on the optical mode proﬁle. Conventional methods of laser physics,
such as the paraxial approximation, become inapplicable in many of
the more exotic cavity designs to be discussed here. Cavities in the
shape of microdisks, pillars and rings can yield low lasing thresholds
in a wide variety of gain media: quantum wells, wires and even dots,
as well as quantum cascade superlattices and GaN. An overview of the
experimental and theoretical status is provided, with special emphasis
on the light extraction problem.

Light emission from microcavities is a problem of great fundamental
and applied interest. A wide range of possible active media can be used
to form microcavities, and consequently the properties of the microscopic
dipoles which generate the light can vary signiﬁcantly. One of our goals is
to identify common, material-independent features of microcavity emitters,
which are strongly determined by the geometric dimensions and shape of
the cavity. Properties of interest are the spectrum of optical modes, their
internal intensity distribution and the external ﬁeld proﬁle of the emitter.
These characteristics in turn determine technological ﬁgures of merit, such
as external quantum eﬃciency in the case of light emitting diodes (LEDs),
or pump threshold and maximum output power in the case of lasers.

A problem in the design of LEDs is their poor external quantum eﬃ-
ciency, owing to the fact that light generated within the diode is not easily
extracted. This is because total internal reﬂection at the interface between

the semiconductor (nin) and the surrounding lower-index medium (nout) al-
lows only those light rays to escape whose angle of incidence χ with respect
to the surface normal satisﬁes

sin χ < nout/nin

A ﬁrst step toward better output coupling in LEDs is to reduce the vertical
dimension (denoted by z) until a planar cavity is obtained [1]. The formation
of Fabry-Perot modes in the z direction leads to redistribution of spectral
weight into peaks of the density of states ρ(k) [2, 3]. As a consequence, the
spontaneous emission of the microscopic dipoles into the remaining cavity
modes is enhanced according to Fermi’s golden rule [4, 5, 6].

This can lead to directional LED emission [7] because the resonant cavity
modes are spatially anisotropic. In a microcavity laser, such as a VCSEL, the
desired directional emission has to be balanced against the additional goal of
obtaining laser oscillation at low threshold power. These two requirements
are incompatible if we consider the conventional threshold condition that
gain and loss must balance out: reducing the linear cavity dimension also
reduces the available gain medium, and this eventually leads to an explosive
increase in pump threshold if the mirror reﬂectivities are kept ﬁxed [8]. On
the other hand, increased mirror reﬂectivity means that the available output
power is small.

Thus, it is desirable both for LED and laser applications to have as
much freedom as possible in the “mirror design” of a microcavity, to create
the analogue of the well-known stable, unstable or confocal conﬁgurations
of macroscopic laser physics [9]. Clearly, vertical layer structures do not
lend themselves to such a level of electromagnetic engineering. However,
the lateral shape of a semiconductor microcavity can be chosen arbitrarily.
To calculate the cavity mode structure, recall that the laser oscillation
condition implies that the wave equation has a solution with outgoing, but
no incoming waves in the far ﬁeld. This radiation boundary condition can
be satisﬁed only at a discrete set of real numbers (k, γ), where k is the
wavenumber and γ the exponential gain constant [10] of the active medium.
This eigenvalue problem can equivalently be stated as a search for complex
wavenumbers ˜k = k
iγ satisfying the above boundary condition with the
index n of the cavity at its transparency value; the solutions are known in
scattering theory as the quasibound states [11]. This is what we mean by
the term “modes” of the leaky cavity.

A possible lateral geometry for a VCSEL is that of a circular cylinder,
It allows comparatively simple modeling because each of its

cf. Fig. 1.

layers can be considered as a short section of a cylindrical waveguide for
which the modes are known analytically [12]. In particular, there are two
types of modes in a cylinder, guided modes whose propagation constant βz
in the z direction is large, and leaky modes with intensity localized close to
the cylinder side wall. When piecing together the ﬁelds in the individual
layers of the VCSEL stack [13], it is not surprising that we encouter both
type of modes in pixelized VCSELs [14]. However, in a ﬁnite-sized, three-
dimensionally conﬁned dielectric cavity all modes are leaky, and in fact the
large-βz modes can turn out to have lower Q than the ones with small βz,
when leakage through the planar mirrors outweighs the lateral radiation
losses. This was conﬁrmed in the threshold behavior of a circular AlGaAs
multiquantum well (MQW) cavity [14] of vertical thickness Lz
λ and
radius R = 15 µm.

≈

n2k2

At large βz, the sidewalls allow waveguiding [15] and hence there is
predominantly vertical emission, with the planar mirrors controlling the
cavity Q factor. On the other hand, small βz leads to total internal reﬂection
at the planar mirrors according to Eq. (1), because the angle of incidence
β2
z /βz, where k is the free-space wavenumber, and
satisﬁes tan χ =
the numerator describes the in-plane component of the internal wave vector.
The lateral leakage is also controlled by total internal reﬂection, provided
the light circulates close to the side wall close to grazing incidence; this is
just the ray-optics equivalent of the ring-shaped intensity patterns which
are commonly known as whispering-gallery (WG) modes, due to an acoustic
analogue described ﬁrst by Lord Rayleigh [4].

p

−

These ring-shaped modes thus avoid refractive escape according to Eq.
(1) at all surfaces of the optical cavity. Hereafter, we deﬁne χ to be the

3

angle of incidence with respect to the side wall normal to focus on the lat-
eral emission properties. Neglecting absorption in the cavity, the WG mode
Q-factor is limited only because internal reﬂection at the side walls is in
fact frustrated by the ﬁnite surface curvature. This wavelength-dependent
correction to the ray picture can be calculated straightforwardly within the
WKB approximation [12, 16], and leads to inﬁnite Q in the λ
0 limit. The
WKB method is here applied to the radial part of the wave equation govern-
ing the cavity ﬁeld (after introducing cylinder coordinates); although it is a
short-wavelength approximation, it has been found to provide quantitative
results even in microcavities of dimensions comparable to the wavelength
[11, 17, 18].

→

In contrast to a VCSEL mode, WG modes of a circular cavity emit
predominantly sideways, and without any prefered azimuthal (in-plane) di-
rection. For such edge emitting devices, Bragg mirrors on top and bottom
of the cavity may be omitted [19], provided the index-diﬀerence between
the guiding layer and surrounding cladding is large enough. The strongest
index contrast clearly results if we manage to suspend the guiding layer in
air. In this way, we get from the circular VCSEL to the microdisk laser [4]:
like a thumbtack, the semiconductor disk is supported in the center by a
pedestal which is thin enough to have only small or no interaction with the
WG modes. Both optically and electrically pumped microdisks have been
realized [20]. For better heat-sinking at room-temperature, one can also
form the WG disk on pillars of other low-index material, e.g. AlxOy [21].

−

Rotational symmetry alone is not suﬃcient to permit exact analytic
solution of the microdisk problem, however. The ﬁeld of a given cavity
mode depends on the cylindrical polar angle φ only through A exp(i mφ) +
B exp(
i mφ), where the integer m is the analogue of a quantum mechani-
cal angular momentum index. However, the radial (r) and z dependence of
the ﬁeld remain coupled by the combination of boundary conditions at the
vertical and lateral interfaces [22]. This makes it necessary either to perform
z plane [23], or to neglect this coupling by
numerical calculations in the r
making a semivectorial approximation [20] which distinguishes between TE
and TM modes. It is in fact conﬁrmed numerically that the electric ﬁeld of
a given mode is either perpendicular to (TM) or in the disk plane (TE), up
to small corrections.

−

If the disk thickness Lz is small enough to satisfy √n2

1kLz < π,
then only the fundamental slab-waveguide standing waves in the vertical
direction are supported for both, TE and TM [22]. The corresponding range
of thicknesses for semiconductor disks (n > 3) is therefore approximately
Lz < λ/5. The TE modes have higher Q than TM modes because the

−

4

electric ﬁeld is better conﬁned in the vertical direction for TE; reported
values for TE modes reach as high as Q = 12000 in a 2 µm diameter disk
with InAs self-assembled quantum dots (“boxes”) as emitters [25]. More
typical Q factors are in the range from Q = 100 . . . 1000; circular disks with
such quality have been used to obtain lasing not only from conventional
MQW structures [20] but also from InAs quantum wires in InP [26] where
optical pump powers of
2mW were found at room temperature. In GaN,
the introduction of a microdisk cavity led to a pump threshold reduction
by an order of magnitude [27]. When only a single quantum dot acts as
the emitter in the disk, lasing is not achieved but highly controlled emission
of single photons under time-periodiv pumping has been demonstrated; the
spontaneous-emission enhancement in the WG microcavity here serves to
reduce the timing jitter [28].

≈

∼

The fact that a microdisk laser emits from its edge could be thought to
cause extreme vertical spreading of the output radiation, if we recall that a
slab waveguide of thickness d has a divergence angle of order
πd/λ: with
disks as thin as 0.2 µm emitting at λ = 1.55 µm, the spreading should be
prohibitive. However, this is not the case [23, 29]. The reason is that the far-
ﬁeld of a microdisk laser cannot be obtained from the near-ﬁeld on its surface
by a simple Fourier transformation, as would be the case for the planar
output mirror of a VCSEL [30]. Rotational symmetry implies conservation
of the φ-“angular momentum” m between the interior and exterior ﬁelds,
and this impresses a centrifugal potential onto the free-space propagation
z plane [11]. This in turn favors radial over
of the emitted light in the r
vertical propagation, reducing the weight of large βz in the emission below
that expected for a Gaussian beam. A rough estimate yields [23] a spreading
angle (FWHM) ∆θ

2/√m.

−

The largest m admitted by a microdisk cavity of radius R and eﬀective
slab index n can be estimated from the condition Eq. (1). One can show
that semiclassically, a mode with azimuthal index corresponds to rays with
angle of incidence satisfying m = n kR sin χ, and since the maximum of χ
is π/2, we ﬁnd that high-Q modes must have m
n kR. As a consequence,
∆θ becomes smaller for larger disk radii, provided they lase on WG modes
close to grazing incidence at the side walls.

≤

≈

Whereas vertical focusing of the emission around the disk plane is thus
surprisingly eﬃcient, there is no easy prescription for inducing focused az-
imutal emission within this plane. As was recognized early on in the pioneer-
ing experiments of Slusher et al., the rotational symmetry of the disk has
to be destroyed [31]. In the inﬁnite space of possible shape deformations,
it is challenging to ﬁnd simple design rules that create preferential emission

5

while at the same time preserving the desired high Q-factor. One type of
shape perturbation that can never be ruled out is side wall roughness. It
turns out, however, that both wavelength and Q factor of WG modes are
quite insensitive to small random perturbations of the circular geometry
[32]. Additional perturbative eﬀects can be caused by the pedestal [33].

When the geometry of the disk is distorted to such an extent that per-
turbative treatments [34] break down, numerical modeling becomes much
more complex because m is no longer a “good quantum number” by which
the modes can be labeled. Motivated by the success of the WKB method
mentioned above, it was suggested early on that short-wavelength approxi-
mations can provide valuable insights into the mode structure and emission
patterns of microlasers [11, 35, 36, 37]. The main observation is that the
internal ray dynamics of a non-circular disk is in general chaotic, so that
methods from the ﬁelds of classical and quantum chaos theory become ap-
plicable. Three chaotic WG modes are shown in Fig. 2, for a wide range
of diﬀerent wavelengths. At the deformation considered here, chaotic ray
motion is the dominant mechanism for escape from the cavity, as opposed
to diﬀractive (λ-dependent) eﬀects. This is evidenced by the fact that γ
in Fig. 2 depends only weakly on wavenumber k. Likewise, one can iden-
tify wavelength-independent features in the internal and external intensity
proﬁles; the emission directionality at large deformations is one of these
characteristics, which to lowest order can be explained without recourse to
the wave nature of light.

The ﬁrst experimental tests of these predictions were performed on lasing
dye microdroplets whose shape is generically oval [36]. When rotational
symmetry is absent, χ in Eq. (1) is not conserved between reﬂections, so
that diﬀusion of photons away from the WG region tends to occur; the
modal decay rate then generally increases with deformation because even
WG rays can reach Eq. (1) after suﬃciently many loops in the cavity.

However, the Q-spoiling due to large deformation is less severe than
expected from ray considerations alone, as was pointed out in Ref. [38]. An
interference eﬀect called “dynamical localization” actually suppresses decay
rates in a manner analogous to Anderson localization in disordered solids
[39], thus making high-Q asymmetric cavities more feasible: the advantages
of asymmetric shapes for directional emission can then outweigh the loss in
cavity Q.

Experimental realizations of non-circular microdisks [40] conﬁrm another
important prediction of the chaos analysis [35]: oval shapes favor WG lasing
only as long as the boundary remains everywhere convex, i.e., has no points
of vanishing curvature. The lateral emission from oval disks is found to

emanate from the regions of highest curvature in semiconductor disks. The
light furthermore escapes tangentially to the surface, as expected for rays at
the critical angle of incidence χc just satisfying Eq. (1).

A striking exception to this rule is expected in similar structures made
of polymers [41] or other low-index materials: the chaotic ray dynamics in
such oval cavities [42] can counter-intuitively prevent WG rays from reaching
χc at the high-curvature points. This “dynamical eclipsing” occurs because
ray chaos is not random, but deterministic; its underlying structure can
in particular rule out certain χ for WG trajectories approaching the high-
curvature points. By changing the material (refractive index) of the cavity
to bring χc into this “forbidden” range, the emission pattern for the same
shape as in Fig. 2 then changes signiﬁcantly.

In contrast to smooth oval deformations, one can also introduce notches
or projections in the side walls, but this tends to increase vertical spreading
[44], thus reducing the expected focusing of the laser. Recalling the depen-
dence of vertical spreading ∆θ on angular momentum, we should aim for
smoothly deformed microdisks emitting near the critical angles of incidence,
yet as anisotropic as possible. At large deformations, cavity modes with this
property can have internal intensity distributions that are qualitatively dif-
ferent from WG modes.

This can be illustrated by a series of experiments on oval lasers, incre-

7

mentally ramping up the deviation from circular shape. Such measurements
have been performed in quantum-cascade microcylinders in the shape of a
ﬂattened quadrupole [43]. The devices were intended for high power and
hence had larger area than the examples above: keeping the minor axis at
b = 50 µm diameter and increasing the major axis to a = 80 µm, it was
found that beyond a threshold deformation a
70 µm, an exponential in-
crease in the maximum achievable output power set in. The lasing mode
was identiﬁed as belonging to a closed “bowtie” ray pattern which does not
exist below the threshold deformation.

≈

The eﬀect of chaos in this experiment is to spoil all cavity modes overlap-
ping the gain region, except for the bowtie modes. This reduces the density
ρ of available modes, while at the same time the internal intensity proﬁle
of the remaining modes becomes more focused in the electrically pumped
center of the structure. The four vertices of the bowtie pattern meet the side
walls near critical incidence, resulting in directional emission. The combined
power of the four emission lobes of up to 10 mW was
1000 times larger
than that of the circular device in the test series.

≈

A special feature of the quantum-cascade system that makes it amenable
to this near-critical mode is that (unlike the previous examples) it strongly
favors emission in TM polarization. This is important because in a high-
index cavity the critical angle for total internal reﬂection is close to the
Brewster angle; therefore, near-critical TE modes suﬀer from much higher
lateral emission than their TM counterparts (the reverse holds for the ver-
tical losses).

A reduced ρ permits reduced lasing thresholds, and the lesson learned
from the bowtie laser is that chaos can reduce the mode density even in rela-
tively large-area cavities. This is because the average of ρ is not determined
by the cavity volume, but by the available phase space volume for long-lived
ray trajectories. The phase space occupied by a ray trajectory is determined
by the real-space area it explores, combined with the range of χ it spans. We
have recently shown [45, 46] that in a WG-cavity of mean radius R (cf. Fig.
2) and index n, the average number of long-lived (non-overlapping) modes
per unit wavenumber interval is

The ﬁrst term is determined by the cavity area, but the corrections for
small n show how the openness of the cavity reduces the density of modes
by expanding the classical escape window Eq. (1) which depends on χ.

In conclusion, phase space reduction and hence lower threshold can be
achieved by shrinking the real area of the cavity, e.g. with holes in the disk
[44] or ring structures [47], or alternatively by engineering the side wall de-
formation to obtain stable modes such as the bowtie while simultaneously
destablilizing most others. Concepts from nonlinear dynamics provide de-
sign guidelines for the latter approach. The rich structure provided by the
ray dynamics in chaotic cavities makes it possible to design shapes for lat-
erally directional emission, which makes it possible to collect the emitted
light more eﬃciently than in rotationally symmetric structures.

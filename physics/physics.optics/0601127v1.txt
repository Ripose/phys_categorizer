A model of the ball lightning

V.K.Ignatovich
Laboratory of Neutron Physics, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, 141980 Dubna
Moscow region, Russia

The ball lightning is supposed to be a shock wave of a point explosion
frozen with electrostriction forces of the internal strong laser discharge.
The life time of the ball with modest parameters is calculated.

PACS numbers:52.80.Mg, 41.90.Jb, 92.60.Pw

Electromagnetic models of ball lightning are considered, for instance, in
papers [1]-[4] notwithstanding the work [5], where it is said that they can not
explain the observed parameters. Most of the authors treat it as a plasma
formation. In particular, in [2] the ball lightning is supposed to be a cavity
with radiation locked by surrounding plasma.

Here we propose another model [6] that can be visualized as a shock wave
of a point explosion in the atmosphere. This shock wave can be stopped and
frozen by a powerful laser discharge inside the wave if it arises in such a mode,
that photon undergoes the total internal reﬂection at the interface of the
shock wave front. In other words the ball lightning is a thin spherical layer
ﬁlled with electromagnetic radiation retained because of the total internal
reﬂection, and the layer itself is conserved because of electrostriction forces
created by the radiation. This model can explain both the high energy and
the long life of the ball lightning. More over it throws some light on the
nature of other phenomena, such as hurricane and tornado and can be used
in many other branches of physics.

To show how the model works we use an analogy with quantum mechanics
of a particle. Since the stationary equation for electromagnetic potential (for
simplicity we use here the scalar approximation)

where k0 = ω/c, ω is the photon frequency, c is the light speed in vacuum
and n is the index of refraction, is very similar to the Shroedinger equation

for particles [8]. Here ψ is the wave function of a particle with wave number
k2, u is a potential energy measured in units ¯h2/2m and m is the mass of the
particle.

To transform equation (1) to the form (2) it is necessary only to denote

[∆ + n2k2

For the equation (2) it is known, that if u is a potential well, the particle

can have a bound state inside it. The same can be said about the photon.

Now, let us consider a potential well, created by an interaction of matter
with a particle. To be concrete, we think of a slow neutron inside a substance.
It is known (see, for example [7]) that the interaction of neutrons with matter
is described by the potential u = 4πN0b, where N0 is the number of atoms
in a unit volume, and b is the coherent scattering amplitude. If b > 0 then
u > 0 and matter repels the neutron, and if b < 0, the matter attracts it. So
a substance with a negative u is a potential well for neutrons. But, and it
is very important, not only matter holds neutron, but the neutron itself also
holds matter i.e it resists its expansion.

Indeed, it is shown on ﬁg.1, that if the matter expands, the density N0 and
the well depth become lower. It leads to rise of the low energy level which
requires supply of energy.

The striction force created by a single particle is small. But if the number
of particles large the force can be also large. This may happen to be very
important for neutron stars. In a neutron star every neutron has a potential
U = 4πN0b, where N0 here is the density of neutrons. It follows, that the
energy of compression may be proportional to N 2
0 . It is very high and may
be greater than the gravitational one. Of course, the neutron is a Fermi

particle. But if we take into account the Fermi statistics [9] and suppose that
the amplitude b of neutron-neutron scattering does not depend on energy,

The gravity compression p =

(4π/3)GR2m2n2 is also proportional to n2.
But it depends on radius R of the star. And for (4/3)R2m3G/¯h2
< 1, which
means R < 22.7 km, the neutrostriction becomes larger then the gravity one.
For the star of the mass of our sun the density of neutrons at such radius is

In the paper [4] the analogous interaction was considered for electrons. It
is shown, that at some density of plasma exchange attractive interaction can
become larger then direct Coulomb repulsion, and it leads to the coherent
binding of plasma particles.

All these considerations can be applied also to γ-quanta. And it leads to
our model for the ball lightning. Indeed n2 = ǫ = 1 + 4πN0α, where N0 is the
number of molecules in a unit volume and α is polarizability of a molecule.
So, the potential

is negative for positive α. It means that usually matter attracts photons, and
this attraction is known as ”pondermotive force” and self focussing. But in
analogy with quantum mechanics of a particle we can speak also about bound
levels of photon, and such approach will give us a possibility to estimate the
life time of the ball.

In the case of anomalous dispersion or at high frequencies ǫ becomes less
then unity. In these cases α < 0, and matter repels photons. This happens,
for instance in the case of interaction with plasma.

It is easy to show, that one should attribute potential and kinetic energy

where d = αE is the induced dipole moment (we suppose the absence of own

For ω < ω01 an unexcited atom is pulled into regions of space with larger
density of photons and if it is excited, it will with the highest probability emit
the same photon which is present in the ﬁeld, because the matrix element of
the transition is proportional to the square root of the total number of the
photons present in the mode. So, the photons in the intense coherent ﬁeld
can not be scattered and atoms are stabilized [12]-[14].

This happens to neutral molecules. But electrons and ions are repelled
by electromagnetic ﬁeld, because their eigen frequencies in space can be put
equal to zero. It means, that if ionization happened at the explosion then the
light electrons will ﬂy before the shock wave front, and after creation of thin
spherical layer ﬁlled with intense electromagnetic ﬁeld electrons remain to
be separated from ions left behind the shock wave, and we obtain a charged
spherical capacity.

Let us consider parameters of the ball lightning. We shall take radius and
the energy of it to be given and equal to 10 cm and 10 kJ respectively and
then estimate its life time.

u(r) is positive, and u represents a

”pocket” on a monotonously decreasing curve, representing the centrifugal
potential. The photons have a metastable state in this pocket. Since the
scattering is prohibited, the only way photons can leave this pocket is through
tunneling.

If total energy is concentrated in photons, then the layer must contain 1023

photons of energy 1 eV each. The density in the layer then is equal Nγ ≈

so the gas density inside the ball can be only 20% higher than outside or the
temperature inside gas is only 60 K higher than outside. Because of higher
density inside the photon ﬁlm, the ball is heavier than environment and falls

can be higher, and the ball can be lighter than the air.

For photon frequencies very close to a resonance the magnitude of n2

can be higher and higher can be the surface tension and gas temperature
inside the ball. Situation improves even more if one takes into account the
Lorenz-Lorentz correction.

The energy of the ball contains also the energy of the spherical capacitor
and the last depends on its charge. Let us suppose that the charge is equal
to Q. An outside electron is attracted by the charge of ions with the force
7 N. But the photons repel it. The

The repulsive force is proportional to the gradient of Nγ. The distribution of
gamma quanta is determined by the Bessel function JL(kr), so dJL(kr)/dr
≈
(L/r0)JL(kr). It means that the force can be estimated as Fe = Lue/r0, or
12 N. This force can withstand the attraction only if the charge is
Fe ≈
10−
10 µCoul. So the total energy of the capacitor is of the order of 1 J,
Q

which is considerably smaller of the total energy. But this is true for a single
electron. For a negative ion the potential (4) can be two order of magnitude
higher, and it increases Q and its electrostatic energy.

To create the ball lightning it is necessary to make a point explosion inside
a medium, where the shock wave makes excitation of atoms. Also it is possible
to use an external pumping. The question is whether the laser discharge will
have enough time to be developed.

To answer this question we compare the time of the light passage around
the ball with that of the shock wave passage over the distance d. The ﬁrst

In principle it is possible to stimulate laser
a photon in the good mode.

It is interesting that external excited atoms incident on the ball may be
reﬂected or deexcited. The last channel is the most probable. After deex-
citation the photon layer pulls the atom inside it, so the ball moves in the
direction of the positive gradient of the density of excited atoms and eats
them up.

In fact, to have a stable ball it is not necessary that all photons inside
the ball skin must be coherent. The coherence is necessary for fast process.

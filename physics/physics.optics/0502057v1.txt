Dielectric microcavities based on cylindrical and deformed cylindrical shapes
have been employed as resonators for microlasers. Such systems support spi-
ral resonances with ﬁnite momentum along the cylinder axis. For such modes
the boundary conditions do not separate and simple TM and TE polariza-
tion states do not exist. We formulate a theory for the dispersion relations
and polarization properties of such resonances for an inﬁnite dielectric rod of
arbitrary cross-section and then solve for these quantities for the case of a
circular cross-section (cylinder). Useful analytic formulas are obtained using
the eikonal (Einstein-Brillouin-Keller) method which are shown to be excellent
approximations to the exact results from the wave equation. The major ﬁnding
is that the polarization of the radiation emitted into the far-ﬁeld is linear up
to a polarization critical angle (PCA) at which it changes to elliptical. The
PCA always lies between the Brewster and total-internal-reﬂection angles for
the dielectric, as is shown by an analysis based on the Jones matrices of the
spiraling rays.

Introduction

There has been a great deal of recent interest in cylin-
drical and deformed cylindrical dielectric resonators for
micro-laser applications.1,2,3,4,5 From the theory side
there is a particular interest in the deformed case, as in
this case such resonators are wave-chaotic systems and
can be analyzed with methods from non-linear dynamics
and semi-classical quantum theory. Analysis of the reso-
nances and emission patterns from such systems has fo-
cused exclusively on the scalar Helmholtz equation which
describes the axial component of the electric (TM mode)
or magnetic (TE mode) ﬁelds for the case of resonant
modes with zero momentum in the axial direction (z-
direction). For this case (kz = 0) the polarization state
is unchanged by boundary scattering and the non-trivial
ray dynamics in the transverse plane does not aﬀect the
polarization state of the resonant solutions. However it is
interesting to consider the solutions of the wave equation
for both cylindrical and deformed cylindrical dielectric
= 0, since in this case the boundary scat-
rods with kz 6
tering couples the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and there
no longer exist TM or TE solutions with a ﬁxed direction
in space for one the ﬁelds. We refer to these non-zero kz

modes as “spiral modes” and note that elastic scattering
from such spiral resonance modes has been measured pre-
viously by Poon et al. Ref. 6, the polarization properties
were unfortunately fully explored in those experiments.
The authors did however measure a systematic “blue-
shift” of the resonance modes with tilt angle, which has
been predicted by Ref. 7,8 and which we will derive be-
low. The modes we study here are similar to the hy-
brid modes known in the study of optical ﬁbers, where it
is also well-known that there are no simple TE, TM or
TEM-like modes, but more complex vector solutions are
necessary. Our emphasis diﬀers however in several ways:
1) we are interested in uniform dielectric rods, not the
variable index proﬁles typical of optical ﬁbers. 2) We are
interested in modes which are not totally internally re-
ﬂected so we can study the nature of the polarization of
the emitted radiation in the far-ﬁeld. 3) We are primar-
ily interested in resonances of uniform rods with cross-
sections in the range of tens to hundreds of µm, so they
are strongly multi-mode and can be treated within the
eikonal (semi-classical) approximation.

Here, we will model ﬁnite resonators as inﬁnite dielec-
tric rods, neglecting the end eﬀects in the z-direction;
we therefore formulate the vector wave equation and the
necessary boundary conditions for an inﬁnite rod of arbi-
trary cross-section. Various approximations are possible
to treat end eﬀects when they are relevant, but we will
not explore them here. We deﬁne the resonant solutions

bitrary cross-section. The ray can refract out and the
polarization can be deﬁned in the far-ﬁeld with respect
to a local coordinate system. For a general deformation,
the polarization will change with the azimuthal angle φ.
Here, we will focus only on the circular cross-section,
where the polarization is constant (with respect to φ)
when referred to the local coordinate system oriented
along and perpendicular to a ray in the far-ﬁeld.

(quasi-bound modes) of such a system and write down a
general formalism which can be used to obtain exact nu-
merical solutions for the vector resonances. We also show
how the corresponding solutions can be used to derive the
spatially-varying polarization state of the emitted radia-
tion in the far-ﬁeld. We then study in detail these equa-
tions in the case of a circular cross-section (cylinder) for
which a great deal of analytic progress and physical in-
sight may be obtained. The analysis of the non-circular
case for which wave-chaotic polarization states are pos-
sible will be published elsewhere.9

Our goal is to relate the polarization state in the far-
ﬁeld to the projected two-dimensional ray motion in the
plane transverse to the z-axis. (See Fig. 1) One can have
spiral resonances which range from motion along the di-
ameter of the rod in the transverse plane (bouncing ball
type modes) to whispering gallery modes which circulate
around the perimeter of the rod as they spiral along it.
We will discuss how the polarization properties of the
resonances vary as the angle of incidence in the plane
(sin χ) and the spiral (tilt) angle (θ) with respect to the
y plane varies. (In Fig. 2 A) we introduce the rel-
x
evant geometric parameters.)
It should be noted that
due to the curvature of the boundary, even modes which
are totally-internally reﬂected according to geometric op-
tics do emit by evanescent radiation into the far-ﬁeld and
their polarization ﬁelds can be obtained from exact so-
lution of the wave equation, although experimentally it
may be impractical to measure their weak emission far

above the critical angle. In the simplest case of kz = 0
(θ = 0) one ﬁnds pure linear polarization in the far-ﬁeld;
in addition, the resonant energies are just those of the
two-dimensional problem of a dielectric disk. In this two-
dimensional case the resonant energies in the semiclassi-
cal limit are determined by the optical path length as
well as by the phase shifts due to caustics and reﬂections
at the boundary.10 These boundary terms in the semi-
classical limit correspond simply to the TIR phase shifts
for TM and TE scattering oﬀ a plane dielectric interface
when sin χ > sin χc = 1/n (here n is the index of refrac-
tion of the rod surrounded by air); if sin χ < sin χc = 1/n
there is zero phase shift but just a loss (imaginary part
of k) given by the Fresnel scattering coeﬃcients. For the
= 0), the boundary terms have a new
spiral modes (kz 6
character corresponding neither to the TE nor to the TM
Fresnel scattering and new phenomena can occur, such
as a non-zero phase shift for modes which are not TIR.
We derive below the generalization of the Fresnel scat-
tering coeﬃcients for spiral modes of the cylinder using
the vector eikonal method. We ﬁnd that the angle at
which a non-zero phase shift sets in is always between
the critical angle and the Brewster angle and coincides
precisely with the onset of elliptical polarization in the
far-ﬁeld. We call this new key quantity the polarization
critical angle (PCA)

In Section 2 of the paper we set up the relevant form
of the vector wave equations for the inﬁnite dielectric
rod and formulate the boundary conditions for the quasi-
bound modes (resonances). In Section 3 we discuss how
to extract the far-ﬁeld polarization of these quasi-bound
modes. All results are for the general case of arbitrary
cross-section of the rod. In Section 4 we specialize to the
case of the dielectric cylinder and reduce the resonance
problem to a simple root-ﬁnding problem. This equation
is exact and is shown to yield the systematic blue-shift in
Ref. 6. In Section 5 we reformulate the same problem us-
ing the eikonal (EBK) method which yields a simpler an-
alytic formula for the resonances and allows a statement
of the polarization problem in terms of generalized Fres-
nel coeﬃcients. The exact and EBK resonance wavevec-
tors are shown to agree quite well, down to small k. In
Section 6 we restate the polarization problem in terms of
Jones matrices and thus derive the internal polarization
state and the farﬁeld polarization of the resonances in the
semi-classical limit. Both the Jones and EBK formula-
tions are shown to yield the same answer for this quantity
and to agree with the exact results to a good approxima-
tion. Finally, the origin of the polarization critical angle
is explained.

we can show that the most general solution of the six-
component vector wave equation for this problem is de-
termined by Ez and Bz components alone; the perpen-
dicular ﬁelds are given by linear combinations of these
two scalar ﬁelds and their derivatives.11 Hence we must

In both cases the equations Eqs. (4)-(7) completely de-

the continuity of the ﬁeld and its normal derivative on
the boundary. In both cases the electromagnetic ﬁeld is
linearly polarized in the far-ﬁeld, either in the direction
parallel to the rod axis (TM) or perpendicular to it (TE).

We will now focus on the kz 6
fer to as spiral modes. We will not consider the extreme
case where k = kz (TEM modes).

Our interest is in the dielectric rod as a resonator, i.e.
as a device for trapping light. Experiments on resonators
fall into two broad categories, and the presence of quasi-
bound modes are manifested diﬀerently in these two sit-
uations. One can measure elastic scattering of incident
laser light from such a rod, as was done in Ref. 6 and focus
on the speciﬁc wavevectors at which one observes scat-
tering resonances. For this case the linear wave equation
that we are studying provides an exact description. One
can also imagine the rod containing a gain medium and
when pumped emitting laser light into these spiral reso-
nances.10 In such a case, the linear wave equation is not
an exact description; however for high-Q resonances typ-
ically the resonances of the passive and active cavity are
very similar.12 In order for the laser to emit speciﬁcally
into spiral modes, there would have to be some mecha-
nism to suppress lasing of planar (kz = 0) modes; one
could imagine doing this with a small seed pump which
is tuned to the frequency of a spiral mode and pushes
it above threshold before all the other modes. It is pos-
sible to describe these two diﬀerent physical situations
(elastic scattering and lasing) using appropriate bound-
ary conditions on the linear vector Helmholtz equation.
To be precise, we assume that the rod is bounded by the
interface ∂D given by (see Fig. 1)

where H ± are the Hankel-functions, H − representing an
incoming wave from inﬁnity and H + an outgoing wave.

To describe the scattering experiment we simply ap-
ply the boundary conditions Eqs. (4)-(7) which will
connect these interior and exterior solutions by a set
of linear equations for the coeﬃcients αm, ξm, . . . , ϑm.
These linear equations will have solutions for any inci-
dent wavevector k and will deﬁne a scattering matrix
for the ﬁelds which can be used to calculate the intensity
scattered at any given far-ﬁeld angle. An example of such
a calculation for the cylinder is given in Fig. 3; the values
of kR (R is the cylinder radius) at which rapid variation
is observed are the resonant wavevectors for which the
incident light is trapped for long periods. However the
precise pattern of radiation in the far-ﬁeld in this case is
determined by both the scattered and incident radiation
and is not representative of a lasing mode for which there
is no incident radiation. To determine the resonances cor-
responding to emission from a source it is conventional to
use the Sommerfeld or radiation boundary conditions; in
this case we would set the incident waves from outside to
zero (the coeﬃcients δm, ϑm in Eq. (12)) and still impose
the boundary conditions of Eqs. (4)-(7). The resulting
linear equations for the remaining coeﬃcients would not
have any solutions for real k (since current is not con-
served), but would have discrete solutions for complex
k values; those solutions are known as the quasi-bound
modes of the problem. It can be shown that the discrete
complex solutions of this problem correspond to the poles
of the S-matrix of the current-conserving problem when
that S-matrix is continued to complex values of k (see
e.g. Ref. 10,13). Re [k] at the pole position gives the ap-
proximate location of the resonant peak in the on-shell
S-matrix and the Im [k] gives the width of the peak; the
Q-value of the resonance is just Q = 2Re [k] /
.
|
These statements hold for kz = 0 resonances; for the spi-
ral modes there are solutions for all kz and for discrete
complex values of the reduced wavevector γ. Once the
resonant wavevector has been found the coeﬃcients of
the outgoing waves can be determined to give the emis-
sion pattern and polarization properties of the emitted
radiation. As is well-known, the Hankel functions with
complex k and large argument grow exponentially and do
not provide normalizable ﬁelds at inﬁnity. This is unim-
portant for studying the emission patterns as a function
of far-ﬁeld angle or polarization properties, although it
may cause some practical diﬃculties in numerical algo-
rithms. If desired, this unphysical feature of the solutions
can be avoided for a given resonance by adding a tunable
imaginary part of the index of refraction to yield a so-
lution with real k outside the dielectric. This imaginary
part represents linear ampliﬁcation in the medium and
would give an estimate for the lasing threshold for that
mode if mode competition eﬀects were negligible. One
ﬁnds that these real k solutions are continuously related
to the complex k quasi-bound states at real index and
have approximately the same spatial properties except
for the absence of growth at inﬁnity.

On the back panel we plot the real k S-matrix, scatter-
ing cross-section at 170◦ with respect to the incoming
wave direction. Notice that the most prominent peaks in
scattering intensity are found at the values of k where a
quasi-bound mode frequency is closest to the real-axis.
These are the long-lived resonances of the cavity. Also
visible is the contribution of resonances with shorter life-
times (higher values of Im [kR]) to broader peaks and the
scattering background. Calculations are for a dielectric
cylinder with n = 1.5 and for kz = 0.

3. Polarization of spiral modes in the far-ﬁeld

Having outlined how to solve for the quasi-bound spi-
ral modes we now analyze their polarization properties.
Strictly speaking polarization of the time-harmonic elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld cannot be deﬁned inside the cavity or
in the near ﬁeld around it as the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds need not be perpendicular to one another or to the
direction of energy ﬂow.
In the far-ﬁeld on the other
hand, where the radiation is well-approximated locally
by a plane wave, we should be able to analyze the po-
larization of the emission from spiral modes in conven-
tional terms. Assuming the matching problem is solved,
the coeﬃcients υm, ζm determining E<
z (ρ, ϕ)
are known and these ﬁelds can be diﬀerentiated in or-
der to ﬁnd E⊥ everywhere outside the rod. These re-
lations simplify if we use the large argument expansion
of the Hankel functions and their recursion relations to
ﬁnd the relative magnitudes of the E-ﬁeld components

To extract the polarization at a particular angular direc-

tion ϕ we need to recognize that far away from the rod
the radiation is not propagating in the radial (ρ) direc-
tion with respect to the cylindrical coordinates centered
on the rod axis but is instead propagating at angle α be-
tween the ρ and z directions determined by Snell’s law
for the z motion (See Fig. 2). We can then rotate our

In this rotated coordinate system in the farﬁeld, the elec-
tric ﬁeld (on the RHS) only has two components in the
plane transverse to the propagation direction. Thus,
the polarization of the electric ﬁeld in the far-ﬁeld is
then determined by the ratio of these two components,
Ez(ϕ)/Bz(ϕ).
If these two ﬁeld amplitudes have zero
phase diﬀerence we have linear polarization in a certain
direction which can vary as the angle of observation ϕ
varies; if there is a non-zero phase shift ∆ between them,
then we typically have elliptical polarization except in the
2 corresponding
speciﬁc case of ∆ = π/2 and
to circular polarization.
It should be noted that when
the angle α is complex kz > k then the wavevector γ2
of the outgoing Hankel functions is pure imaginary and
there is no propagating radiation as ρ
; this cor-
responds to the total internal reﬂection condition with
respect to the z motion of internal ray in the cylinder,
n sin θ = 1 (see Fig. 2), for which there is no evanescent
escape. It should be emphasized however that this does
not correspond to the true total reﬂection condition for
spiraling rays, which comes at smaller θ except in the
case of normal incidence in the transverse plane. In par-
ticular one can ask about the polarization states in the
far-ﬁeld of spiral whispering gallery modes, which emit
solely by evanescent escape.

The analysis up to this point has been exact for a
dielectric rod of arbitrary cross-section and the vari-
ous formulas can be used to solve for both the reso-
nance wavevectors and polarization properties of the spi-
ral modes of such a system. We have developed and
implemented a numerical algorithm to do this11; we in-
tend to describe the algorithm and present results for
deformed cylinders in a subsequent paper.9 At this point
we specialize to the problem of spiral modes of a cylinder
for which a number of analytic techniques are possible
which will allow us to develop a useful physical picture.

4. Quasi-bound resonances in the cylinder

Focusing now on the case of the cylinder (circular cross-
section) we have the immediate simpliﬁcation that the
Helmholtz equation and boundary conditions separate in
cylindrical coordinates and we can look for solutions cor-
responding to a single component of the angular momen-
tum, m, instead of the sums in Eq. 11. In the following
we will use the following notation:

The vanishing of the left bracket describes the reso-

Further insight into the solutions can be obtained by
noting that for kz = 0 and m
= 0 the TE and TM res-
onance values diﬀer so that at a typical TM resonance,
for example, the factor GT E will have its typical order of

magnitude while the factor GT M vanishes. By continuity
of these functions with θ we can expect for small θ that
the resonances will have one of the factors GT M,T E small
while the other is not, and that the corresponding reso-
nance will have a TM or TE character, i.e. the electric
ﬁeld will be predominantly in the z-direction or predom-
inantly in the x
y plane. The TE-like resonances will
then show a large width (imaginary part) near the Brew-
ster angle while the TM-like resonances will not. As the
tilt angle θ increases the spiral modes become full mix-
tures of TE and TM modes and it is no longer possible to
classify them in this manner. In Fig. 4, θ is small enough
to classify them as TE- and TM-like and the coloring
represents this classiﬁcation.

we have developed the theory in a more intuitive semi-
classical approximation in Sections 5 below.

A. Small θ expansion

In the limit of small kz, or θ, we see that Eq. (22) is of
order θ2 on the left hand side. Close to a T E or T M
like resonance at k = k0,kz = 0, one of the factors GT E
or GT M is small while the other is not. We expand the
small term (which vanishes on resonance) to lowest order
in θ2 and insist that the resonance condition is satisﬁed
at a slightly shifted value of the resonance wavevector,
nk = n(k0 + ∆k0). One can then show that

where α is given by a ratio of Bessel functions, which is
plotted in Fig. 5. Note that the coeﬃcient α
1 for rela-
tively small sin χ; exactly this value follows from the EBK
quantization formula near normal incidence discussed in
Section 5. This result can be compared to experiments
done by Andrew Poon,6 where a tilted optical glass ﬁber
was illuminated with an unfocused Gaussian beam. A
simple “wavefront matching” argument for this blue shift
was given in Ref. 6 and is reproduced in Fig. 6. An inci-
dent plane wave propagates along the Xlab direction and
is incident onto a rod tilted by an angle α. An upward
propagating spiral resonance requires that the spiral wave
be in phase with the incident wave farther up the tilted
ﬁber. However upper incident wave of the same phase
front must travel an extra distance d to reach the ﬁber
when it is tilted. Thus the phase-matching condition be-
tween the internal wave and the extended incident wave
reduces the eﬀective cavity length for the spiral wave by
a distance d/n, where n is the refractive index. Fixing

therefore the resonances are quadratic blue shifted with

In Fig. 7 we compare the blueshift obtained from the
exact numerical solution of Eq. (32) to the small θ expan-
sion Eq. (29). The agreement is quite good. We will see
at the end of the next section that the EBK quantization
will give the same quadratic blue shift.

5. The EBK quantization conditions

→ ∞

As already noted, using the quantized solutions of res-
onance condition Eq. (22), we can easily calculate the
polarization in the farﬁeld. However, to get insight into
the dependence of the polarization on the internal ray
motion, a more appealing approach is to use the eikonal
method, and the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) type
formulation of the resonance conditions. The eikonal
method in general refers to ﬁnding approximate solution
of the wave equation with a speciﬁc ansatz which is ex-
pected to be good in the short-wavelength limit (k
).
The EBK method describes how to apply that ansatz to
boundary value problems, typically assuming Dirichlet
or Neumann boundary conditions.15 The approach has
been used for example to ﬁnd approximate quantization
formulas for the circular and elliptical billiard systems.16
Recently it was generalized to treat the scalar Helmholtz
equation for a dielectric billiard in two dimensions.10
However it was also emphasized that the EBK method
only works for the small subset of boundary shapes for
which the ray motion within the boundary is integrable,13
a point which goes all the way back to Einstein’s original
paper in 1917.17 The motion of a ray within an inﬁnite
cylinder is also integrable (the energy and z-components
of linear and angular momentum are conserved) and a
generalization of the EBK method should work in this
case also. The necessary generalization is to introduce
the boundary conditions appropriate for the coupled Ez
and Bz components of the ﬁeld; this will lead to a gener-
alization of the Fresnel coeﬃcients for a plane interface.
We study the vector Helmholtz Equation (3) for
Ez(x, y), Bz(x, y) in the semiclassical limit k, γ1,2 → ∞
;
in this limit we expect the solutions to have rapid phase
variations and relatively slow amplitude variations. The
generalized EBK ansatz for the quasi-bound solutions of

the vector Helmholtz Eq. (3) can be written as

Here the quantity

integers and Γi refer to topologically irreducible set of
loops. To avoid confusion in this section we temporarily
γ. Keller showed that in order
drop the subscript γ1 →
for the EBK solution to be single-valued it is necessary
that these loop integrals of the phase be quantized and
that any two topologically inequivalent and non-trivial
loops can be chosen. Φi is a total phase shift due to
for the scalar two-
caustics and boundary scattering;
dimensional Helmholtz equation in a circle these phase
shifts are known for Dirichlet, Neumann and dielectric
boundary conditions. For the case of a dielectric circle
the phase shifts are complex in general, representing ei-
ther refraction out of the circle or the phase shift at the
boundary due to total internal reﬂection.10 In order to
get the appropriate ray dynamics for the spiral modes it
is easily shown that the eikonals S1, S2 must be identi-
cal to those of the two-dimensional circular billiard (i.e.
kz = 0); the new feature here is an additional eigenvalue
condition on the amplitude two-vector, which will deter-
mine the eigenpolarization directions. This will lead to
a modiﬁcation of the phase shifts Φi with respect to the
two-dimensional case.

Before discussing the latter point we brieﬂy review
the quantization relations assuming the Φi are known.
Two conventional loops for implementing the quantiza-
tion conditions are shown in Fig. 8. The ﬁrst loop, Γ1,
goes just outside the inner turning point of a ray of ﬁxed
angular momentum;
S points in the direction of the
ray so this integral just yields the length of the caus-
tic for this ray. No caustic surfaces are crossed and the
path does not touch the boundary, so the phase Φ1 = 0.
Thus the ﬁrst loop gives a relation equivalent to angular
momentum conservation,

A. Semi-classical boundary conditions for dielectric rod

To treat the spiral modes of a dielectric cylinder in
this approach we need to project the three-dimensional
boundary conditions corresponding to Snell and Fresnel’s
laws into two dimensions. The relevant angles for this
projection are all deﬁned in Fig. 2 Since we are in the
ray optics limit we can regard the “scattering” of the
eikonal from the boundary as the scattering of a plane
wave from the tangent plane. Because of our assumption
of only outgoing waves, it is suﬃcient to assume only an
incident, reﬂected and a transmitted wave (see Fig. 9).

Hence, as is clear geometrically, the projected Snell’s law,
leads to total internal reﬂection of the projected motion
before the critical angle sin χ = 1/n is reached in the
plane (this is simply because the actual angle of incidence
is steeper than the projected angle due to the z-motion);
the function f (θ) which determines the eﬀective critical
angle is plotted in Fig. 10.

We recognize the diagonal elements as the Fresnel coeﬃ-
cients for TM (denoted by subscript s) and TE (subscript
p) plane waves incident on a dielectric interface. The di-
agonal nature of the matrices implies that for θ = 0 these
polarization states are preserved. When θ
= 0 the matri-
ces have oﬀ-diagonal elements implying the mixing of po-
larization states upon reﬂection (strictly speaking these
matrices mix Ez and Bz upon reﬂection, which will be
shown to be equivalent to rotating the local polarization).
Recall that we are applying the EBK quantization condi-
tion (31) to the two-vector (Ez(x, y), Bz(x, y)); when we
integrate around the path B in Fig. 8 which touches the
boundary, we must impose the correct dielectric bound-
ary conditions on this two-vector. In general this changes
the ratio of Ez to Bz and will lead to a multi-valued so-
lution as we complete the closed loop (for uniform in-
dex rods, only boundary scattering leads to the rotation
of the two-vector). Therefore in order to have a single-
valued solution the ratio of Ez to Bz must be unchanged
upon reﬂection, i.e. the two-vector Ψi must be an eigen-
vector a of the reﬂection matrix,

Ra = Λa.

(51)

We thus see that for the spiral modes of the cylinder
there are two allowed mixtures of TM and TE polariza-
tion for each resonance labelled by angular momentum
m and wavevectors γ1, kz; the eigenvalues of the R ma-
trix Λ = eiη will give the extra phase shift Φ2 needed
to complete the EBK quantization condition in Eq. (33)
(Φ2 = η + π/2 where the term π/2 comes from the caus-
tic phase shift). As already shown above, at θ = 0 the
R matrix is diagonal, conventional TE and TM states
are eigenvectors and the eigenvalues are just the Fres-
nel reﬂection coeﬃcients, rs, rp. These have the familiar
property of being purely real and less than unity for inci-
dent angle χ below total internal reﬂection, and complex
numbers of modulus unity for angles above TIR. Hence
one has pure reﬂection and refraction with no phase shift
below TIR, and pure phase shift and no refracted wave
above TIR. The phase shifts for totally internally re-
ﬂected TM and TE waves are diﬀerent and well-known
functions of χ.18 This familiar behavior is modiﬁed for
the spiral modes.

The behaviour of the eigenvalues Λ = eiη of the ma-
= 0 is shown as a function of the angle
trix R for kz 6
sin χ = m/γ in Fig. 11. Note that η is in general complex,
and we are plotting here its magnitude. The magnitude
of the eigenvalues are diﬀerent up to a point between the
Brewster angle (vertical dashed), and the CA (vertical
dashed). At this point the the eigenvalues become com-
plex conjugates of each other. We will call this point, the
polarization critical angle (PCA) and will explain how it
is related to the far-ﬁeld polarization below. Hence spiral
modes acquire a phase shift upon reﬂection before they
reach the critical angle. Not until the CA do Λ1,2 lie
on the complex unit circle as they should for TIR. Thus
we have a new phenomenon, a phase shift for a refracted
wave. Having determined the two possible values of Φ2,

be α = 1 for small sin χ, just as we found in Fig. 5 above.
As noted there, this coeﬃcient changes slightly when the
polarization critical angle is reached; this change is cap-
tured by the contribution from f (χ, θ) we have just ne-
glected. In Tab. 1 we compare the resonances found by
the exact wave matching method (Eq. (22)) and by the
EBK method ﬁnding good agreement for θ = 0.1, 0.2.

In general we can always calculate the R matrix via

sequently act with T on the internal eigen-polarizations

to determine the corresponding polarization in the far-
ﬁeld. A physically more transparent method to do this
involves the a reformulation of the problem in terms of
the actual polarization vector, rather than the two-vector
(Ez, Bz). Below, we will introduce an equivalent ma-
trix description in terms of the Jones Algebra which we
will subsequently show to be exactly equivalent to the
(Ez, Bz) description.

6. Jones formulation of polarization properties

We introduce the parallel and perpendicular components
of the electric ﬁeld, Ep and Es in the local coordinate
system deﬁned by the plane of incidence. The Jones vec-
tor19 which describes the local polarization is

E =

Ep
Es!

 

=

(55)

with E0s and E0p being the magnitude of the electric
ﬁeld and the phases φs and φp. The Jones matrix for
the reﬂection and transmission at a dielectric interface is

and would describe any series of reﬂection in the same
plane of incidence. However a spiraling ray in the cylin-
der changes its plane of incidence at each reﬂection, so

that we need to rotate our coordinate system into the
new plane of incidence between each reﬂection before we
apply the Jones reﬂection and transmission matrices. (It
is precisely this rotation of the plane of incidence for a
spiraling ray which is the physical reason behind the non-
conservation of TE or TM polarization).
If the angle
between the two planes is given by ξ we can do this by
multiplying the Jones vector by the rotation matrix R(ξ).
This angle ξ can be determined for a general cylindrical
symmetry.11 Due to the rotational and translational sym-
metry of the cylinder, the polarization at each angle φ on
the cylinder must be the same for any value of z and must
be described by the same Jones vector when referred to
the plane of incidence at that point. Therefore the Jones
vector emerging from a reﬂection must be the same as
the incident Jones vector once the coordinate system has
been rotated into the new plane of incidence. This yields
an eigenvalue condition for the Jones vectors describing
the spiral modes of the cylinder,

(58)

where J = R(ξ)Jr. Thus the two polarization states
are the two eigenvectors of J and their eigenvalues ν1,2
describe the phase shifts and refractive losses at each
reﬂection, just as do the eigenvalues of R for the two-
vector Ez, Bz studied earlier. Therefore, the two matrices
J and R are related by a similarity transformation and
have the same eigenvalues11 which is conﬁrmed in Fig. 12.

7. Polarization critical angle

Realizing that the eigenvalues of interest are obtained
from the product a rotation and a diagonal Jones matrix
with known entries allows us to understand the behavior
of the these eigenvalues rather simply. The eigenvalues
can now be written in terms of the rotation angle of the
plane of incidence, ξ and the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients

Consider the discriminant of the eigenvalues, D =

are real or complex. Recall that the TM Fresnel reﬂection
coeﬃcient, rs is real and positive for all angles below the
critical angle passing through unity and becoming com-
plex and unimodular above the critical angle; whereas
the TE reﬂection coeﬃcient, rp is real below the crit-
ical angle but becomes negative at the Brewster angle
and passes through negative one before becoming uni-
modular and complex above the critical angle. It follows
that D will always be positive and ν1,2 real for angles
of incidence below the Brewster angle. However for any
non-zero value of the rotation angle ξ, D will become
zero before the critical angle since at the critical angle
cos2ξ) is negative. The value of the incidence

(PCA) which we have already mentioned above. Since
it occurs when both rs, rp have absolute value less than
unity, the eigenvalues ν1,2 also have modulus less than
unity and we have a phase shift upon reﬂection while a

fraction 1
This fraction can be calculated and does not correspond
to either of the usual Fresnel transmission coeﬃcients for
TM or TE. The behavior of the eigenvalues just described
is shown in Fig. 13 A); the behavior of the polarization
critical angle vs. sin χ is shown in Fig. 13 B). We see
that for small θ the onset of the the phase shift is close
to the critical angle (CA); as θ varies the PCA moves
close to the Brewster angle and then for θ close to the
CA, where for any sin χ we will have TIR, the PCA re-
turns to the CA. This analysis allows us a simple un-
derstanding of why there is a PCA which precedes total
internal reﬂection. The TM and TE components of the
spiral resonances have no relative phase shift at reﬂection
until the Brewster angle; at the Brewster angle the TE
component picks up a π phase shift, which mixes with
the TM component to give a phase shift between zero
and π. Right at the Brewster angle rp vanishes and the
local TE component of the resonance is ﬁltered out, but
as the TE reﬂectivity picks up above the Brewster angle
this phase shift appears before total internal reﬂection
condition is reached. It is interesting to note that due
to the ﬁnite phase aquired at the PCA, the resonance
condition Eq. (53) is slightly changed. The term PCA
suggests that at this angle the polarization properties of
the spiral modes change. We shall see that this is the
case in the next section.

8. Polarization properties of spiral modes

When the eigenvalues of the J matrix are real, the eigen-
vectors can be chosen real (up to an overall phase) and
thus there is no relative phase shift between Es and Ep.
While in general polarization is not well-deﬁned inside
the dielectric, in the short wavelength limit we are now
examining it is well deﬁned with respect to the considered
ray direction, and zero relative phase shift implies linear
polarization of the resonance with respect to the spiral-
ing ray direction. Above the PCA, when the eigenvalues
are complex, the eigenvectors also become complex and
there is a relative phase shift between Es and Ep cor-
responding to elliptical polarization of the internal ﬁeld.
This picture is conﬁrmed by the calculation of the eigen-
values plotted in Fig. 14 A), B). At small sin χ we have a
large ratio between the eigenvector components and zero
phase shift, corresponding to linear polarization with the
electric ﬁeld almost completely in the z or transverse di-
rection (TM-like and TE-like). After the PCA we get
a phase shift approaching π/2 and equal ratios leading
to circular polarization right at the CA; above the CA
we have in general elliptical polarization for the internal
ﬁelds with a calculable ellipticity and with a phase dif-
ference of π/2 as expected for whispering gallery modes.
The far-ﬁeld polarization arising from this internal ﬁeld
can be found by applying to the relevant eigenvector of
J the transmission matrix Jt and then rotating the re-
sulting vector by an angle Θ which projects the Jones
vector onto the the plane perpendicular to the outgoing

In Fig. 15 A), B), we compare the far-ﬁeld polarization
states for spiral resonances of the cylinder as predicted by
the exact and geometric optics approach. We ﬁnd good
agreement between the methods, although the exact so-
lutions smooth the abrupt behavior near the PCA pre-
dicted by the geometric optics approach. Above the CA
we have only evanecent emission, but the eccentricity of
the two-vector is still ﬁnite. Note that as formulated, the
Jones approach gives a continuous solution for the two
polarization states, whereas the exact resonances are dis-
crete and correspond to discrete allowed angles χ which
can be also found through the EBK approach. The Jones
approach provides a smooth and k-independent formula
for the polarization states which agress with those of the
resonaces.

equation for a two-component vector ﬁeld living in the
two-dimensional cross-sectional plane. We have devised a
formulation of the resonance problem for the quasi-bound
modes (spiral resonances), which can be implemented nu-
merically for a general cross-section, and shown how the
polarization state of the resonances in the farﬁeld can
be determined. Calculations were reported for the case
of a circular cross-section (cylinder) and the results were
compared to ray-optical results from an EBK formula-
tion of the resonance problem in the semi-classical limit.
We have analyzed the polarization state of the spiral res-
onances both inside the cylinder and in the farﬁeld, and
related its properties to the internal ray motion. It was
shown that as the tilt angle of the spiraling ray with
respect to the cross-sectional plane is increased, there
exists a polarization critical angle at which the polar-
ization changes from linear to elliptical both internally
and externally and this occurs before the total internal
reﬂection condition, so the eﬀect can be measured read-
ily in the far-ﬁeld. The physical picture we developed in
terms of the Jones polarization vectors was useful in un-
derstanding the PCA and may be useful in generalizing
the analysis to arbitrary cross-sections for which the ray
motion can be chaotic.

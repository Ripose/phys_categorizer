Using a microscopic theory based on the Maxwell-semiconductor Bloch equations, we investigate
the possibility of an optically-assisted electrically-driven THz quantum cascade laser. Whereas in
optical conversion schemes the power conversion eﬃciency is limited by the Manley-Rowe relation,
the proposed optically-assisted scheme can achieve higher eﬃciency by coherently recovering the
optical pump energy. Furthermore, due to quantum coherence eﬀects the detrimental eﬀects of
scattering are mitigated.

Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) have become an im-
portant topic during the last decade. Based on transi-
tions between conduction subbands, QCLs have been fab-
ricated for a wide range of infrared frequencies. Recently,
signiﬁcant interest has focused on the development of
QCLs in the THz regime [1]. In a THz-QCL, carriers are
injected directly into the energetically higher laser sub-
band (direct THz-QCL). The lower laser subband can be
depleted by zero, single or double optical-phonon scat-
tering, [1],[2],[3], yielding a population inversion between
the lasing subbands. However, the required threshold is
reasonably low only at low temperature. As both lasing
subbands are located energetically low in the structure
[see Fig. 1 (a)], thermal backﬁlling destroys the popu-
lation inversion at high temperature. Additionally, tem-
perature dependent scattering processes (parasitic cur-
rent channels) also reduce the population inversion. As a
result, lasing threshold of direct QCLs in the THZ regime
increases appreciably with increasing temperature, limit-
ing the present maximum operation temperature to 164
K [4].

Optical conversion is one approach to circumvent the
problem of thermal backﬁlling, e.g.[5],[6]. Instead of elec-
trically injecting the carriers directly into the upper laser
subband, the upper laser subband is populated by an ex-
ternal optical ﬁeld [see Fig. 1(b)]. However, while con-
ventional optical conversion presents a solution to the
problem of population thermalization, it also introduces
a fundamental constraint due to the Manley-Rowe quan-
tum limit,
the highest achievable conversion eﬃ-
ciency is given by the quotient of output and input fre-
quencies.

i.e.

In this letter, we propose and model an optically-
assisted electrically-driven quantum cascade laser.
In
contrast to optical conversion schemes, the THz energy
is not derived from the external optical ﬁeld, but comes
from the forward electrical bias as in a conventional QCL,
thus allowing coherently recovery the pump energy. In
this way we get the advantages of an optical conversion

scheme, but for ﬁrst time are not constrained by the
Manley-Rowe limit. The basic idea is sketched in Fig. 1
(b). Crucial to the approach is the design of the coupled
quantum wells so that the transition frequencies between
subbands 1 and 2, and subbands 3 and 4 are suﬃciently
similar so that an external optical ﬁeld can simultane-
ously populate the higher laser subband (2) and deplete
the lower laser subband (3), thus regaining the pump
photons via stimulated emission.

We investigate our scheme theoretically using a micro-
scopic approach that considers the nonlinear interactions
between the externally applied ﬁeld, the THz-ﬁeld, and
the active region. The active medium is treated within
the framework of the semiconductor Bloch equations for
polarizations Pij (x, t) between subbands i and j and sub-
band populations ni(x, t) at time t and in-plane direction

a carrier density of n = n1 = Pi ni = 5
At lattice temperature TL = 150 K, carrier-carrier and
carrier-phonon scattering redistribute the carriers be-
tween the subbands with γ12 = 0.5 ps −1, γ23 = 1.6
ps−1 and γ34 = 0.14 ps−1. These rates are determined
from quantum kinetic calculations as described in Ref.
[7]]. The ﬁnal subband is depleted with an extraction
rate of γexc = 0.5ps−1. In order to determine the gain
of THz radiation, we probe the structure with a con-
tinuous wave (cw) THz-ﬁeld. By optically exciting the
structure with a Gaussian pulse (temporal width σ = 1
ps, centered around 7.5 ps) which spatially propagates
in the quantum-well in-plane direction x, we control the
population of the energetically higher laser subband 2.
Intersubband transitions occurring between subband 2
and 3 yield the desired THz gain.

Before we evaluate the beneﬁt of recycling the pump
photons in terms, we analyze the underlying physical ef-
fects for three diﬀerent combinations of external exci-
tation strength and probe intensity: (a) Imax, D = 2.8
kW/cm−2, ITHz = 0.044 kW/cm−2; (b) Imax, D = 2.8
kW/cm−2, ITHz = 0.394 kW/cm−2; (c) Imax, D = 26.5
kW/cm−2, ITHz = 0.044 kW/cm−2. As we will show in
the following, these three cases highlight the importance
of the relative strength of the radiative transitions and
their connection to the two diﬀerent origins of THz gain,
i.e. stimulated emission and quantum coherence eﬀects.

Here Γa gives the 2D-conﬁnement (y,z) of the ﬁeld mode
a to the active region.

fects. The dipole-allowed polarizations are dominated

by directly driven intersubband transitions (stimulated
emission or absorption). During the ﬁrst half of the drive
pulse, the excitation of carriers from subband 1 into 2 and
depletion of subband 3 via stimulated emission by the ex-
ternal optical ﬁeld occurs on a faster timescale than the
actual laser transition yielding strong population inver-
sion [see Fig. 2(a1)], which drives the generation of THz
radiation [see Fig. 2(a2)]. With decreasing drive pulse in-
tensity, the strength of the radiative transitions between
subband 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, is diminished. Radiative
and non-radiative transitions between the laser subbands
now occur faster than the radiative transitions between
subbands 1 and 2. Furthermore, the decrease of drive
intensity also yields an attenuation of the directly driven
4 transitions, which are important for emptying the
3
lower laser subband and regaining the pump intensity.
Consequently, the lasing population inversion disappears.

→

In case (b), we use the same driving ﬁeld as in case
(a) but increase the probe intensity. Therewith, we in-
crease the strength of the radiative transitions between
the laser subbands. Intersubband transitions between the
laser subbands occur faster than intersubband transitions
between subband 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, respectively, pop-
ulation inversion does not occur [see Fig. 2(b1)]. Con-
sequently, THz radiation cannot be generated via stim-
ulated emission but only via quantum coherence eﬀects.
Whereas in case (a) quantum coherence eﬀects were al-
most negligible, the increased probe intensity in case (b)
allows the build-up of substantial quantum coherence
contributions - substantial enough to create THz radi-
ation [see Fig. 2 (b2)]. Cases (a) and (b) demonstrate
clearly the importance of the relative strength of the ra-
diative transitions. By changing their ratio externally
(via an increase of the probe intensity) we were able to
completely switch between the two origins of THz gain.

However, in a QCL the THz generation will build up
gradually. As a result, the relative strength of the radia-
tive transitions and the magnitude of quantum coherence
contributions will also change with time. THz radiation
will ﬁrst be generated only via stimulated emission, with
increasing THz intensity quantum coherence eﬀects will
become more important. The latter can be seen in case
(c), where we used the same low probe intensity as in
case (a) but increased the driving ﬁeld drastically. As
in case (a), the relative strength of the radiative transi-
tions allows the build-up of population inversion between
the laser subbands. The THz ﬁeld is too weak to create
substantial quantum coherence contributions, stimulated
emission is the cause of the observed gain in THz radia-
tion. However, compared to case (a) we now excite the
structure with a much stronger driving pulse, i.e.
the
driving pulse does not get absorbed as quickly as in case
(a) and can propagate further into the structure. With
increasing THz intensity (due to stimulated emission)
and decreasing driving ﬁeld, the relative strength of the
radiative transitions changes. After the driving pulse has
propagated roughly 0.15 cm, the population inversion has
almost completely vanished [see Fig. 2(c1)]. Stimulated
emission is no longer the cause of the observed gain in
THz radiation [see Fig. 2(c2)]. Due to the high intensity
of generated THz radiation, quantum coherence eﬀects
are substantial enough to yield a further increase in THz
radiation. Thus, whereas cases (a) and (b) demonstrate
how an external increase in the probe ﬁeld [from case (a)
to (b)] can yield a switch between the two origins of THz
gain, example (c) shows how for the case of a strong ex-
ternal drive ﬁeld the same switch occurs gradually in the
sample.

To evaluate the beneﬁt of recycling the pump photons,
we present in Fig. 3(a) the conversion eﬃciencies for

cases (a)-(c) and compare the results for the optically-
assisted scheme and a conventional optical conversion
scheme (no recovery). As can be seen, the optically-
assisted scheme yields a substantial increase in ﬁnal con-
version eﬃciency due to the recovery of the drive ﬁeld.

counts for the relative loss of pump energy due to the
excitation of carriers from the injection subband into the
higher laser subband, Im(P43(x)) gives the relative recov-
ery of pump energy due to stimulated emission between
the lower laser subband and subband 4. Comparing the
relative strength of the time-integrated polarizations for
the three cases shows that the recovery of the pump is
more successful in case (b) than in case (a) which ac-
counts for stronger improvement in the ﬁnal conversion
eﬃciency compared to the optical conversion scheme. In
cases (b) and (c), the recovery of the pump energy is
strong enough to yield conversion eﬃciencies clearly ex-
ceeding the Manley-Rowe relation. A complete recovery
of the driving ﬁeld intensity would yield a conversion eﬃ-
ciency of inﬁnity. However, non-radiative transitions and
damping of the polarizations due to carrier-carrier and
carrier-phonon scattering reduce the recovery of the drive
intensity. Note that in case (c), the conventional opti-
cal conversion scheme at early distances actually yields a
better eﬃciency than the optically-assisted scheme. This
is because at early distances, the lower laser subband is
depleted less eﬃciently in the optically-assisted scheme
than in the optical conversion scheme yielding less THz-
radiation via stimulated emission.

Figure 3(a) also shows clearly the dependence of the
conversion eﬃciency on the dominant origin of THz gain.
Switching from stimulated emission to quantum coher-
ence eﬀects as the dominant contribution yields a dra-

matic increase in the achievable conversion eﬃciency
[compare case(a) to case (b)] - for both the optically as-
sisted approach and the optical conversion scheme. As
the stimulated emission of THz radiation depends lin-
early on the population inversion, the conversion eﬃ-
ciency in case (a) is strongly suppressed by the amount
of non-radiative transitions between the lasing subbands.
The magnitude of the quantum coherence contributions
on the other hand is less sensitive to the lifetimes of carri-
ers in the higher laser subband yielding higher conversion
eﬃciencies.

In summary, we investigated the feasibility of an
optically-assisted electrically driven THz scheme for
THz-QCL. The uniqueness of the approach involves the
possibility of reducing the amount of parasitic scatter-
ing by energetically lifting the laser subbands, recycling
the pump photons back into the system, and controlling
conversion eﬃciency by tailoring the optical pump. For
the example of pulse excitation, we showed the intricate
interplay of stimulated emission and quantum coherence
eﬀects leading to eﬃcient generation of THz radiation
exceeding the Manley-Rowe quantum limit.

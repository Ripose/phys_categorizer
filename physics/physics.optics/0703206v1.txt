From the conservation of momentum for the general nonlocal nonlinear schroedinger equations,
we predict that the two nearby solitons will attract each other, propagate together, and steer totally
when their phase diﬀerent is not 0 or π. The tilting angle is obvious only when the interval distance
between the solitons is in the region of beam width. The experimental results carried out in nematic
liquid crystal do agree with the theoretical predict quantitatively. It is feasibility to steer light beams
by control their phase diﬀerent.

The solitons are common phenomenon appearing in
many physical ﬁelds, while the interactions of the soli-
tons have great potential for much wildly applications.[1]
The strongly nonlocal soliton, also known as accessi-
ble soliton[2], have some signiﬁcative properties and at-
tracted more attentions in the last decade[2, 3, 4, 5].
Several highly nonlocal medium have been found in ex-
periments, such as the nematic liquid crystall[4, 5, 6], the
lead glass[7], and the thermal nonlinear liquid[8], and the
nonlinear gas of ions[9].

In strongly nonlocal medium, experiments and the-
ories have shown that the attraction can occurr be-
tween the bright solitons with any phase diﬀerence (in-
or out-phase)[10, 11, 12], the coherent or incoherent
solitons[13, 14], or the dark solitons[8, 15]. In the con-
trary the local Kerr-solitons can attract only for in-phase
bright solitons [1].

In above works, the interactions of two strongly non-
local solitons are thought independent of the phase dif-
ference. Here, from the the conservation of momentum,
we predict that when the interval distance between two
solitons are relative small, their interaction should de-
pend on their phase diﬀerence. We show theoretically
and experimentally that two nonlocal solitons with an
arbitrary phase diﬀerence can attract each other, propa-
gate together, and steer by the phase diﬀerence.

Let us consider a (1+2)-D model of light ﬁeld, linear
polarized with envelope A, propagates in z-direction in
the medium with a nonlocal nonlinearity,

We assume the response function R(x−x′, y −y′) is shift-
invariant, while the medium is large enough comparing
to the width of soliton and the inﬂuence of the boundary
condition is negligible weak. The normalized condition,
−∞ R(x′, y′)dx′dy′ = 1, is chosen physically to make the
nonlinear index n2 similar to that in local Kerr-medium.
R
If R(x, y) is a delta function, ∆n(x, y) = n2|A(x, y)|2 and
Eq.(1) becomes to the well-known nonlinear schroedinger
equations (NLSE) in local Kerr medium.

The Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), so-called general nonlocal non-
linear schroedinger equations (GNNSLE), can cover all
nonlocal medium observed in the experiments.

For the GNNLSE, serval well-known invariant inte-
grals are important for the theoretical analysis. The

From the Eq.(7) we can see that the inﬂuence of the
angle α′ is similar to the distance h′. Figure 1 shows the
variation of β′
x depends on h′ and γ, where α′ = 0. For
γ = 0 or π, we have βx = 0. The βx has signiﬁcance value
only when h is about or smaller than the beam width w0.
When h > w0, the two beams in Eq.(5) do not overlap
so the βx decreases to almost zero. The maximum value
of βx is about slight bigger than half of γ.
It means
the steering angle of whole beam are signiﬁcance only for
thin beams (large divergence angle) with small interval
and small escape angle.

When the interval h is ﬁx, two solitons steer left or
right dependent on the γ < π or γ > π. The smaller h,
the larger tilt angle βx. When cos γmax = − exp(−h′2),
βx reach the maximum value. For each h we have two
γmax between π/2 and 3π/2 for steering left and right,
respectively. γmax approach to π while h decreases to
zero.

Although the momentum integral Eq.(3) is also valid
for a local Kerr-medium NLSE system, the inﬂuences
of momentum conservations on the interactions of soli-
tons are signiﬁcant diﬀerent.
In ﬁg.(2), we shown the
numerical simulation of the propagation of two solitons
in a (1+1)D local, weakly nonlocal, and strongly nonlo-
cal medium, where red lines show the gravity center of

FIG. 2: The contour graph of the propagation of two soli-
tons in a local kerr-medium(left column), and in a (1+1)D
nonlocal medium with an exponential-decay response func-
tion R(x) = (2wm)−1

with diﬀerent wm). The red lines show the moving of the
gravity center of two solitons. The phase diﬀerence between
two solitons are 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2, respectively(from top to
bottom).

strongly nonlocal medium can attract each other for any
phase diﬀerence, while only in-phase solitons can attract
in local Kerr-medium[1]. However, the gravity center of
two solitons in both local and nonlocal medium propa-
gate in same trace determined by Eq.(3). As shown in
ﬁg.(2), the two solitons in strongly nonlocal nonlinear
medium can attract each other, propagate together like
a whole bound beams, and steer direction with a angle
determined by momentum M . For local kerr-medium, if
the phase diﬀerent γ = 0 or π, the momentum M = 0,
the two solitons attract or repulse away symmetrically
around z-axis, while for other phase diﬀerence they es-
cape away asymmetrically and the gravity center also
depart from z-axis.

It is worth to note that the model by Synder and
Mitchel[2] can not predict the steering of the strongly
nonlocal soliton pairs. In their model the solitons with
any phase diﬀerence attract and propagate together alone
z-axis, because they deal with the nonlinear change
∆n(x, y) but loss the inﬂuence of the detail distribution
of light ﬁeld A(x′, y′).

which dominates the rotation of the optical ﬁeld. The
conservation of the angular momentum has been used
to explain the rotating of the optical soliton clusters in
Kerr-medium[19]. Here in Fig.(3), we show that the four
soliton cluster with positive (top line) or negative(bottom
line) angular momentum rotates in anti-clock or clock
directions.

The above analysis is universally valid for all strongly
nonlocal media and we carried out the experiment in the
nematic liquid crystals to verify our prediction.

The conﬁguration of the NLC cell is the same as in the
previous works[12, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The optical ﬁeld polar-
ized in y-axis with envelope A propagates in z-direction.
An external low-frequency electric ﬁeld ERF is applied
in y-direction to control the initial tilt angle of the NLC.

The evolution of the paraxial beam A and the tilt angle θ
can be described by the equations in Ref.[[4, 23]].The re-
sponse function of the nematic liquid crystal is a zero-th
order modiﬁed Bessel function,

for a (1+2)D cylindrical symmetrical case[4, 12], or an
exponential-decay function [R(x) = (1/2α) exp(−|x|/α)]
for a (1+1)D case[11]. The parameter α here indicates
the degree of nonlinearity, which is the ratio of beam
width w0 to the characteristic length wm of the nonlinear
nonlocal response function R.

a = 0.5474, and ǫRF

The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 4c. The
laser beam from the laser is split into two beams, then
they are combined together with a small separation
through the other beam-splitter and launched into a
80µm-thick NLC cell by a 10× microscope objective.
The beam width at the focus w0, the separation ds and
relative angle β between the two beams are measured
by an edged-scanning beam proﬁler when the NLC cell
is removed. The cell is ﬁlled with the NLC TEB30A
(from SLICHEM China Ltd.), whose nk = 1.6924, n⊥ =
1.5221, K ≈ 10−11N , ǫop
a = 9.4.
The bias voltage on the cell is set to 1.4V to obtain a
pretilt angle nearly π/4 for the lowest of critical power
of soliton. The launched power for each beam is ﬁxed
to 6mW . The parameters for the beams inside the NLC
are calculated from the measurement without NLC cell,
i.e. w0 = 2.2µm, ds = 2.25µm(h′ = 0.51), tan β =
0.0076(α′ = 0.165), and the divergence angle Θ = 0.0231.
The phase diﬀerence between the two beams is ad-
justed by the rotation of a 1.8mm-thick parallel-face
plate, and measured through the interference pattern
by the beam proﬁler located on the other branch after
the second beam-splitter. First we ﬁnd the position of
the plate while the phase diﬀerence is adjusted to 0 (in
phase), then we rotate the plate in small steps to increase
the phase diﬀerence γ. We record the beam traces for the
diﬀerent γ by the CCD camera, as shown in Fig.5.

In Fig.5 (a) and (b), two single beam are launched into
NLC respectively, and their traces are straight and hor-
izontal. When two beam inject simultaneous, the whole
beam will tilt (c) up or (d) down (actual in x direction).
Since the interval distance is so small that two solitons
cannot be distinguished by the microscope in our exper-
iment, we will see the whole beam, as a bound state,
steering by changing the phase diﬀerent γ. For each γ,
we take ﬁve photos of the beams for minimum the jitters
of the tilting angles due to the instability of the laser
and phase diﬀerence. The tilting angle of each photo
are measured to be shown in Fig.6 as square points, and
the theoretical predication by Eq.7 is shown in solid line.
We can see that the experiment points locate around the
theoretical prediction with a relative small random er-
ror. The error may mainly come from the slight jitter
of the phase diﬀerence γ. Except those random error,

we can say that the experiment results consist with the
theoretical prediction very well.

Our above results are yielded from the momentum con-
servation for the general nonlocal nonlinear schroedinger
equations, we are conﬁdent that in other strongly non-
local medium besides the NLC, two soliton will attract
each other, propagate together, and steer dependent on
their phase diﬀerence. In theoretical the interactions be-
tween nonlocal soliton are diﬀerent for short range (in-
terval distance h < w0) and long range ( h > w0). The
model by Synder and Mitchel[2] is only valid for long
range interaction of strong nonlocal solitons. For short
range, change of one beam may steer the two beams to-
gether, which may have applicable potential for all light
switch or router.

Modern laser sources nowadays deliver ultrashort light pulses reaching few cycles in duration, high
energies beyond the Joule level and peak powers exceeding several terawatt (TW). When such
pulses propagate through optically-transparent media, they ﬁrst self-focus in space and grow in
intensity, until they generate a tenuous plasma by photo-ionization. For free electron densities and
beam intensities below their breakdown limits, these pulses evolve as self-guided objects, result-
ing from successive equilibria between the Kerr focusing process, the chromatic dispersion of the
medium, and the defocusing action of the electron plasma. Discovered one decade ago, this self-
channeling mechanism reveals a new physics, widely extending the frontiers of nonlinear optics.
Implications include long-distance propagation of TW beams in the atmosphere, supercontinuum
emission, pulse shortening as well as high-order harmonic generation. This review presents the
landmarks of the 10-odd-year progress in this ﬁeld. Particular emphasis is laid to the theoretical
modeling of the propagation equations, whose physical ingredients are discussed from numerical
simulations. The dynamics of single ﬁlaments created over laboratory scales in various materials
such as noble gases, liquids and dielectrics reveal new perspectives in pulse shortening techniques.
Diﬀerences between femtosecond pulses propagating in gaseous or condensed materials are un-
derlined. Attention is also paid to the multiﬁlamentation instability of broad, powerful beams,
breaking up the energy distribution into small-scale cells along the optical path. The robustness
of the resulting ﬁlaments in adverse weathers, their large conical emission exploited for multipol-
lutant remote sensing, nonlinear spectroscopy, and the possibility to guide electric discharges in
air are ﬁnally addressed on the basis of experimental results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the past two decades, ultrafast laser sources pro-
ducing ultrashort pulses have come of age. Technological
advances in this ﬁeld have permitted the generation of
light wave packets comprising only a few oscillation cy-
cles of the electric ﬁeld. In space, the extent of the pulses
becomes focusable to a spot size comparable to the laser
In time, mode-locking and chirped-pulse
wavelength.
ampliﬁcation (CPA) technologies allow to access smaller
and smaller durations and optical intensities locally ex-
ceeding hundreds of terawatt (TW) per cm2 at moderate
(sub-mJ) energies. Power levels nowadays approach the
petawatt range with femtosecond pulse durations (1 fs
15 sec.). Ultrashort light pulses enable researchers
= 10−
to probe ultrafast relaxation processes on never-before-
accessed time scales and study light-matter interactions
at unprecedented intensity levels. Due to extreme tem-
poral and spatial conﬁnements, the pulse strength ex-
ceeds that of the Coulomb ﬁeld which binds electrons
at their nucleus. It becomes strong enough to overcome
the Coulomb barrier and triggers optical-ﬁeld ionization.
Pushed to ultrahigh intensities > 1018 cm2, the availabil-
ity of CPA lasers has extended the horizon of laser physics
from atomic and optics studies to relativistic plasmas,
nuclear and high-energy physics (Mourou et al., 2006).

Before reaching such extreme intensities, progress in
ultrashort laser systems has led to the ability to ob-
serve tunnel or multiphoton ionization in several spectral
ranges, before the ionization process reaches saturation.
In this regime, an intriguing phenomenon was discovered
by Braun et al. (Braun et al., 1995) in the middle of the
nineties. By launching infrared pulses with femtosecond
durations and gigawatt (GW) powers in the atmosphere,
the beam became conﬁned to a long-living, self-conﬁned
tube of light capable of covering several tens of meters,
i.e., many linear diﬀraction lengths, along the propaga-
tion axis. The mechanism supporting this ”light bullet”

results from the balance between Kerr focusing, which
increases the local optical index with the wave intensity,
and self-induced ionization. When an ultrashort pulse
self-focuses and couples with a self-induced plasma chan-
nel, its spatial proﬁle exhibits a narrow extent along the
optical path. Spectra broaden due to self-phase modu-
lation (SPM), which is sustained by the mechanism of
high-intensity clamping. This picture classically refers
to what is commonly called a ”femtosecond ﬁlament”.
In the diﬀraction plane, this ﬁlament is characterized by
a white-light spot, surrounded by concentric ”rainbows”
with colors ranging from red to green. The high nonlin-
earities competing through the ﬁlamentation process pro-
duce an impressive supercontinuum leading to white-light
emission. They also aﬀect the beam divergence through
an apparent conical emission, as illustrated in Fig. 1

Femtosecond ﬁlaments have,

for the last decade,
opened the route to a fascinating physics. Their highly
nonlinear dynamics sparked broad interest, ﬁrst because
of the capability of femtosecond pulses to convey high
intensities over spectacular distances, second because of
the white light emitted by the ﬁlaments transforming in-
frared lasers into ”white-light lasers” (Chin et al., 1999b;
Kasparian et al., 2003). For appropriate beam conﬁgu-
rations, long fs ﬁlaments can be created not only in the
atmosphere, but also in noble gases, liquids and dielec-
tric solids, as long as the pulse intensity does not reach
the limit of optical breakdown, which implies the electron
plasma density to remain at subdense levels. These opti-
cal structures are subject to strong modiﬁcations of their
temporal proﬁle, triggered by SPM together with the ion-
ization front and the chromatic dispersion of the medium.
The dynamical balance between nonlinear focusing and
ionization can result in a drastic shortening of the pulse
duration, down to the optical cycle limit. This prop-
erty opens quite promising ways to generically deliver
light with durations of a few fs only, which should fur-
ther impact the ﬁelds of high-order harmonic generation
and sub-fs pulse production. Besides, femtosecond pulses
with broad spatial extents create several ﬁlaments, whose
mutual interactions support the self-guiding of the beam
envelope and can preserve a conﬁned state upon several
kilometers. This recently led to develop ultrashort LIght
Detection And Ranging (Lidar) facilities, that exploit the
white light emitted by these ﬁlaments, in order to detect
and identify several pollutants within a single laser shot.
Many applications have been inspired by this ultra-
fast ”light bullet”, which justiﬁes the present review.
Before commenting on these, an accurate understand-

ing of the ﬁlamentation phenomenon requires a rigorous
derivation of the propagation equations together with ba-
sic tools for capturing the underlying physics. For this
purpose, Section II addresses the model describing the
long range propagation of ultrashort laser pulses in any
optically-transparent medium. Section III reviews the
basic phenomenon of wave self-focusing and its limita-
tion by potential players such as plasma generation, chro-
matic dispersion and optical nonlinearities. Emphasis is
given to semi-analytic (e.g., variational) methods provid-
ing qualitative information about these eﬀects. Section
IV lists the major phenomena driving femtosecond ﬁla-
ments, whatever the propagation medium may be. Sec-
tion V is devoted to pulse shortening that can be achieved
by letting femtosecond pulses ionize atom gases at ap-
propriate pressures and to high-order harmonic genera-
tion. Section VI addresses diﬀerent propagation regimes
in condensed materials (water, silica glasses), from the
laser-induced breakdown limit to X-shaped nonlinear
waves self-guided with no plasma generation. Section
VII concentrates on the atmospheric applications of the
white-light supercontinuum emitted by ultrashort ﬁla-
ments. Current techniques for changing their onset dis-
tance and self-channeling length are discussed, together
with the diagnostics used for plasma and optical-ﬁeld
measurements. Attention is paid to novel ultrashort
LIDAR-based setups and their use in remotely analyzing
aerosols, biological agents, dense targets through remote
ﬁlament-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Their ability
to trigger and guide electric discharges over several me-
ters is also discussed. Section VIII ﬁnally summarizes
the principal aspects of this review and presents future
prospects.

To start with, we derive the model describing the prop-
agation of ultrashort optical pulses in transparent me-
dia. Using conventional description of nonlinear optics,
straightforward combination of the Maxwell’s equations

certain frequency ranges (far from resonances) by, e.g.,

optical or weakly-ionized materials as well. This prop-
erty justiﬁes the use of a scalar description for linearly-
polarized beams having, e.g., Ey = 0.

2. Weak backscattering

The question of evaluating backscattering waves may
be crucial in several areas, such as remote sensing exper-
iments (Kasparian et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2001), which
spectrally analyze the photons returning towards the
laser source. The amount of backscattered photons, how-
ever, constitutes a weak percentage of those traveling
in the forward direction through a transparent medium.
The reason can be seen from the scalar version of Eq.

B. Nonlinear optical responses

We henceforth assume a linearly polarized ﬁeld (along,
e.g., ~ex) and treat nonlinear eﬀects within a scalar de-
scription. For centro-symmetric materials, only one rel-
evant component of the tensor remains in the cubic con-
tribution P (3), e.g., χ(3) = χ(3)
xxxx (Agrawal, 2001). For
simplicity, we may ﬁrst consider χ(3) as keeping a con-
stant value for a spectral domain centered around ω0. Eq.
(4) then simpliﬁes with a single component, noted χ(3)
ω0 ,
and in time domain one ﬁnds P (3)(~r, t) = ǫ0χ(3)
ω0 E3. This
expression holds whenever we suppose an instantaneous
response of the medium, which ignores the contribution
of molecular vibrations and rotations to χ(3). Strictly
speaking, however, the phenomenon of Raman scatter-
ing comes into play when the laser ﬁeld interacts with
anisotropic molecules. This interaction can be schema-
tized by a three-level system built from the rotational
states of a molecule. The molecular scatterer has two
rotational eigenstates, the ground state (level 1) with en-
ergy ~Ω1 and an excited one (level 2) with energy ~Ω2
where ~ = 1.06
34 Js and Ωm denotes the frequency
of the state m = 1, 2, 3. Far above lies an electronic

represents ponderomotive forces acting on slowly-varying
time scales. For linearly-polarized electromagnetic ﬁelds
( ~E, ~B) oscillating at the high frequency ω0, the driv-
ing term ~Π admits envelope components containing gra-
dients of the ﬁeld intensity, radiation pressure due to
electron collisions and changes in the electron den-
sity. Ponderomotive forces induce low plasma currents,
which can in turn generate electromagnetic pulses (EMP)
(Cheng et al., 2001, 2002) and provide sources of co-
herent sub-THz radiation (Tzortzakis et al., 2002). Nu-
merical simulations (Pe˜nano et al., 2004; Sprangle et al.,
2004) have shown, however, that for 100-fs pulses reach-
ing intensities of 1014 W/cm2 and free electron densities

In dielectrics, the plasma

deromotive terms can thus be ignored, as long as peak
intensities are below 1015 W/cm2. In this range, plasma
density perturbations due to Langmuir wave oscillations
and relativistic increase of the electron mass have also a
negligible inﬂuence. Therefore, the equation for the cur-
rent density reduces to Eq. (32) in which Π = 0. At the
lowest order in ve, the growth of the electron density is
only governed by the source term

In dielectrics, much shorter recombination times are in-

decreases like f (ρ) = ρ/τrecomb (Audebert et al., 1994;

the

limit of zero elastic collisions with ions by Kennedy
(Kennedy,
1995), Yablonovitch and Bloembergen
(Yablonovitch and Bloembergen, 1972) and by Feit and
Fleck (Feit and Fleck, 1974). Often linked to what is
called the ”Drude” model, it determines energy losses
through plasma (cascade) ionization.

In Eq. (34), W (I) denotes the rate for photo-
ionization.
It is evaluated from perturbative theories
valid as long as the electric ﬁeld E is weaker than
the atom ﬁeld strength Eat. This rate has been red-
erived in Appendix A, following Keldysh’s and Perelo-
mov, Popov and Terent’ev (PPT)’s theories apply-
ing to atoms or dielectrics (crystals) (Keldysh, 1965;
Perelomov and Popov, 1967; Perelomov et al., 1966,
1967). To describe the ionization of complex atoms, PPT
formula usually includes the so-called ADK coeﬃcients
[for Ammosov, Delone and Krainov (Ammosov et al.,
1986)], originally established in the limit of high inten-
sities. Optical ﬁeld ionization theories stress two major
limits bounded by the ”adiabaticity” Keldysh parameter,

namely, the limit for multiphoton ionization (MPI, γ
≫
1) concerned with rather low intensities and the tunnel
limit (γ
1) concerned with high intensities, from which
the Coulomb barrier becomes low enough to let the elec-
tron tunnel out. Here, Ep denotes the peak optical am-
plitude (Ep = √2c1I). For simplicity, we ignore the phe-
nomenon of above-threshold ionization (Agostini et al.,
1979; Corkum et al., 1989), through which the electron
embarks more kinetic energy than K~ω0 −

dominates, where K = mod(Ui/~ω0) + 1 is the num-
ber of photons necessary to liberate one electron. For
higher intensities, tunnel ionization starts to contribute,
i.e., electrons tunnel out within one optical cycle. De-
spite the complexity of ionization formulas, all of them
exhibit common dependencies on the laser ﬁeld strength
(Perry et al., 1988b; Reiss, 1980). By producing charged
ions of noble gases as a function of the laser inten-
sity, quantitative measurements conﬁrmed the validity of
Keldysh theory for singly-charged ions only (Perry et al.,
1988a). This theory basically applies to hydrogen atoms
and discards the Coulomb ﬁeld of the residual ion on the
outgoing electron. The PPT/ADK or Krainov’s models
(Krainov, 1997), instead, better reproduce experimen-
tal ionization rates of atoms in, e.g., the tunnel regime
and may even suit for higher-charged states (Augst et al.,
1991; Cornaggia and Hering, 2000). On this basis, ion-
ization of diatomic molecules can be predicted through
semi-empirical theories using the PPT rate in which the
electron tunnels through a barrier with eﬀective poten-
tial Zeﬀ /r. Here, Zeﬀ is determined by ﬁtting the theo-

retical slope of the PPT formula onto measured ion sig-
nals. For ion signals collected from the interaction of O2
and N2 molecules with a 800 nm laser pulse, Zeﬀ is in-
ferred from PPT applied to a corresponding atom (Xe
atom) with ionization potential close to that of dioxy-
gen molecules (U O2
12.1 eV, Zeﬀ = 0.53) and to Ar
atoms with Ui close to the energy gap of N2 molecules
(U N2
15.6 eV, Zeﬀ = 0.9) (Talebpour et al., 1999).
The PPT/ADK formula can alternatively be extended
to O2 molecules by selecting the molecular coeﬃcients of
Tong et al. (Tong et al., 2002) within the so-called ”ADK
Molecular” ionization model (Nuter and Berg´e, 2006).

Figure 2 illustrates ionization rates for some of the pre-
vious theories applied to O2 molecules [Fig. 2(a)] or to
fused silica [Fig. 2(b)]. PPT and ADK molecular ioniza-
tion rates plotted in solid and dashed curves diﬀer by only
one decade. The dotted curve indicates the experimental
ﬁt from O+
2 signals with the PPT rate using Zeﬀ = 0.53.
A good agreement is achieved between this ﬁt and the
ADK molecular ionization curve. Note that as long as
the beam saturates below 1013 W/cm2, the MPI limit
alone can be retained. Beyond this intensity, the photo-
ionization rate departs from the law σK I K and must in-
clude tunnel contributions. To get qualitative behaviors
only, the MPI rate may, however, be used at higher in-
tensities, while keeping the interaction physics valid.

Because free carriers are ﬁrst generated by photo-
ionization, we must take the corresponding losses into
account. Via energy conservation law, self-consistent ex-
pressions for these losses can be established. The tempo-
ral evolution of the energy density w is determined by a
local version of the Poynting theorem, i.e.,

d

from which we can compute the energy lost by the
pulse when it extracts electrons through single ionization

The amount of energy per time and volume units is then

~E = Ui∂tρPI where ∂tρPI ≡

describes the self-focusing of optical wave-packets with
n2 > 0 (Askar’yan, 1962; Marburger, 1975). Self-focusing
is a nonlinear phenomenon common to several branches
of physics. In optics, it intervenes through the refractive
optical index Nopt = n0+n2I that increases with the ﬁeld
intensity and forces light rays to refract onto the axis.
This causes a compression of the beam in the diﬀraction

1. Principles of wave self-focusing

With a purely cubic nonlinearity, solutions to the
Cauchy problem (51a) can blow-up (or collapse) at ﬁ-
nite distance (Kelley, 1965; Sulem and Sulem, 1999). To
describe this singular process, let us consider the NLS

ψ stops to exist in H 1 (Rasmussen and Rypdal, 1986).
This mathematical singularity reﬂects the ultimate issue
of the nonlinear self-focusing in the absence of saturation
of the Kerr response and under the paraxiality assump-
tion.

While H < 0 arises from Eq. (54) as a suﬃcient con-

In the critical case D = 2, this inequality can be used to
bound H from below, so that the gradient norm blows up
only if P fulﬁlls the constraint P > Pc. The best constant
in Eq. (55) is exactly Cbest = 2/Pc and it involves the

quantity Pc =
symmetric soliton solution, called the ”Townes mode”, of
1∂rr∂rR+R3 = 0 (Chiao et al., 1964; Weinstein,
−
1983). Pc justiﬁes the existence of a critical power for
the 2D self-focusing of optical beams in nonlinear Kerr
media. In the supercritical case D = 3, a criterion for
collapse, sharper than H < 0, can be established from
a combination of Eqs. (54) and (55) as H < P 2
c /P for
gradient norms initially above 3P 2

2. Variational approaches

Because the cubic NLS equation is not integrable at
high dimension numbers D
2, approximation methods
≥
describing the fate of singular solutions may be employed.
Among those, ”variational approaches” consist in build-
ing a set of dynamical equations governing the size, am-
plitude and phase of the beam. These beam parameters
are evaluated from functional integrals (Action or La-
grangian integrals) computed from a given trial function,
which the pulse is supposed to keep along the optical
path. Such methods give global, qualitative behaviors
within a pedestrian way. Their principal drawback is
that, as they need to fulﬁll the main conservation laws
(e.g., preservation of the L2 norm), they capture the en-
tire initial mass of the solution and do not let the latter
evacuate radiation to the boundaries or relax to an exact
ground state. This discrepancy may partly be cured by
accounting for corrective damping of the nonlinear core
(Ar´evalo and Becker, 2005; Kath and Smyth, 1995), but
improvements become rapidly tricky and limited. Vari-
ational principles applied to NLS solutions were exten-
sively studied (Anderson, 1983; Anderson and Bonnedal,
1979; Anderson et al., 1979; Bondeson et al., 1979;
Desaix et al., 1991) and further exploited in diﬀer-
ent contexts (Cerullo et al., 1996; Karlsson et al., 1992;
Manassah, 1992; Manassah et al., 1988; Pietsch et al.,
1991; Silberberg, 1990; Vidal and Johnston, 1997). They
were also widely worked out by several authors in
the present scope (Couairon, 2003b; Esarey et al., 1997;
Lehner and Auby, 2000; Sprangle et al., 1996).

(59) yield qualitative behaviors for the propagation of a
single femtosecond pulse preserving its cylindrical sym-
metry. It, of course, cannot depict any temporal or spa-
tial splitting phenomenon, but oﬀers a global evolution
of the beam intensity. This evolution fairly supports the
comparison with (3 + 1)-dimensional numerical simula-
tions (Champeaux and Berg´e, 2005), apart from an over-
estimated nonlinear focus. Figure 5 shows an example of
peak intensity reached by Gaussian pulses with param-
eters Pin/Pcr = 22, w0 = 1 mm, tp = 100 fs at the
wavelength λ0 = 800 nm in the limit T
1 and dis-
persion limited to GVD. Collapse is arrested by plasma
generation. The dashed curve corresponds to the solu-
tion reconstructed from the two-scale variational method.
The solid one shows the result obtained from numerical
integration of the propagation equations.

Besides, alternative procedures, such as perturbative
methods, may provide qualitative information about

the changes in the scale L(z, t) induced by contribu-
tions that can stop the collapse. Here, the radial size
L(z, t) tends to zero in the diﬀraction plane as z
→
zc, but it now depends on time. The principle is to
perturb a collapsing state that naturally tends to the
Townes mode R, by means of L2 orthogonal perturba-
tive modes. These will provide an integral relation for
the z-dependent function β [Eq. (57)], directly depending
on

as for NLS with attractive potentials (leMesurier et al.,

the maximal amplitude, in the location of the ﬁrst fo-
cus and in the temporal shapes. Because they rely on
trial functions that capture the same power and shape as
initial, variational procedures cannot accurately describe
ﬂuctuations in the wave envelope. They should therefore
be employed for what they are, i.e., as qualitative proce-
dures yielding ﬁrst indications on the beam dynamics.

B. Saturation by temporal dispersion

≃

By mixing GVD and spatial diﬀraction when T

1,
the Kerr nonlinearity causes defocusing in time for k′′ > 0
(normal dispersion) and temporal compression for k′′ < 0
(anomalous dispersion), besides wave focusing in the
transverse direction. The interplay of these processes
results in the symmetric splitting of the pulse along
the time axis with normal GVD (Chernev and Petrov,
1992a,b) and to a 3D spatiotemporal collapse with
anomalous GVD (Berg´e, 1998). In addition, when ultra-
short pulses develop sharp temporal gradients, the op-
erator T in front of the Kerr term (self-steepening) in-
duces a shock dynamics: The ﬁeld develops a singular
proﬁle with
in the trail (t > 0) of the pulse
(Anderson and Lisak, 1983). This dynamics is reinforced
by space-time focusing (Rothenberg, 1992). Figure 7 de-
picts temporal proﬁles of pulses undergoing steepening
eﬀects in normally dispersive regime (silica glass at 790
nm), together with a transverse collapse.

+

To understand these dynamics, we can consider ultra-
short pulses as being stacked along the temporal direction
into diﬀerent time slices having each their own power,
e.g., P (t) = Pine−
for Gaussian proﬁles. Slices located
at times t < 0 correspond to the front (or leading) pulse;

2t2

those at t > 0 constitute the back (trailing) pulse. Each
time slice self-focuses at its respective singularity point,
zc(t), according to Eq. (50) in which the ratio Pin/Pcr
2t2
must be replaced by Pine−
/Pcr. This scenario is known
as the ”moving-focus” model (Lugovoi and Prokhorov,
1974; Shen, 1976) and yields simple comprehension el-
ements to ﬁgure out the pulse distortions. Here, the cen-

Eq. (63) describes defocusing around the central slice:
Normal GVD transfers power towards non-zero instants,
symmetrically located with respect to t = 0.
Self-
steepening and space-time focusing moreover produce a
transfer of power from the leading ( ˙zc < 0) to the trail-
ing portion of the pulse ( ˙zc > 0). This asymmetrizes the
temporal proﬁle, which was retrieved by direct exper-
iments (Ranka and Gaeta, 1998). Normal GVD alone
”splits” a focusing pulse into two regular, symmetric
spikes at powers < 2Pc. For higher powers, the peak
edges develop shock proﬁles and disintegrate into rip-
plelike cells (Fibich et al., 2003; Germaschewski et al.,

Normal GVD (k′′ > 0) and plasma formation compete
at powers moderately above critical to halt the wave col-
lapse. The stronger the GVD coeﬃcient, the larger the
power interval in which the collapse is arrested by pulse
splitting. By solving the cubic NLS equation with nor-
mal GVD, a boundary δcrit(¯p), function of the ratio of
input power over critical, ¯p = Pin/Pcr, can be calculated
in such a way that initial conditions fulﬁlling δ > δcrit(¯p)
will limit the Kerr self-focusing through GVD splitting
instead of letting the solution diverge into a singular state
(Luther et al., 1994a). Higher-order dispersion together

sense of ”delaying” the self-focusing threshold to higher
powers (Skupin and Berg´e, 2006; Skupin et al., 2006a).
In particular, third-order dispersion tends to delocalize
the pulse by pushing the temporal centroid to the back
(Fibich and Ilan, 2004).

In contrast, for anomalous GVD (k′′ < 0) power is
transferred to center, as seen from Eq. (63) with δ < 0.
Ultrashort pulses thus collapse both in space and time.
A mapping

basis of virial-type arguments (Berg´e and Skupin, 2005;

Figure 8 summarizes the zone of collapse and no-
collapse in the plane (δ, ¯p) for both normally and anoma-
lously dispersive media computed from Eqs. (45). Open
circles represent initial conditions that do not collapse.
Close ones result in a strong divergence of the beam
intensity. Three zones clearly occur: (I) A dispersion-
dominated domain leading to pulse spreading; (II) A
transition zone in which GVD and steepening operators
inhibit the self-focusing; (III) A Kerr-dominated region,
in which chromatic dispersion is unable to stop the wave
blow-up. Here, the ﬁeld intensity can increase by several
decades before reaching the ionization threshold. Note
that for anomalous GVD, the collapse process, which en-
compasses spatial and temporal compressions, makes the
intermediate zone II almost meaningless.

C. Saturation by plasma defocusing

ﬁle through the sudden emergence of an ionization front
near the focus point zc. In the absence of time dispersion

D. Saturation by optical nonlinearities

Additional defocusing quintic nonlinearities pro-
duce stable solitons
in continuous-wave (cw) me-
dia (Trillo and Torruellas, 2001). This property fol-
lows from a balance between diﬀraction, Kerr fo-
cusing and nonlinear saturation. When a quintic
contribution is added (
the beam
starts to self-focus and evacuates part of power into
diﬀracting components to reach a stable ground state
of Eqs. (51) (Gatz and Herrmann, 1997; Kolokolov,
1976; Malkin, 1993; Vakhitov and Kolokolov, 1975;
Vidal and Johnston, 1996). This property is partly re-
ﬂected by Eqs. (62) emphasizing an arrest of collapse like
1/L2, which induces regular oscillations

Reframed in the present context, several papers ad-
dressed the question of limiting self-focusing by nonlin-
ear optical saturations, instead of relying on plasma gen-
eration alone (Gaeta and Wise, 2001; Koprinkov et al.,
2000, 2001). In fact, it appears that the weight of χ(5)
susceptibility depends on the actual pulse length, on the
ratio of instantaneous over delayed Kerr responses and
on the ionization sources, that inﬂuence the maximum
intensity attained by the beam (Ak¨ozbek et al., 2001;
Couairon, 2003a; Vin¸cotte and Berg´e, 2004). This prop-
erty can be seen from the zeroes of the nonlinear refrac-

saturation prevails over ionization and induces a soliton-
like dynamics at high enough values of n4, before the
occurrence of an electron plasma. Relevance of higher-
order optical nonlinearities above all depends on the ion-
ization rate: For example in air, if the laser intensity sat-
urates above 1014 W/cm2 by plasma generation alone,
then even weak values of n4 can soften this peak inten-
sity. At lower intensities, quintic saturation has a more
limited role. For instance, Fig. 10 displays the peak in-
tensities, beam radius (FWHM of the ﬂuence distribu-
tion), maximum electron density and energy losses of a
70-fs, 0.5 mm-waisted unchirped Gaussian pulse prop-

single time slice located near t = t∗
at powers close to critical (Berg´e and Couairon, 2001a;
Henz and Herrmann, 1999). Thus, plasma generation is
accompanied by a sharp duration shortening of the pulse
(see, e.g., inset of Fig. 6).

When GVD and MPA come into play, the leading
peak becomes unstable and refocusing of the trail oc-
curs at high enough input powers. With MPA, the lead-
ing component is partly damped in the intensity ratio

forms a density plateau [see Eq. (62b)]. Consequently,
the electron density attains much lower levels and per-
mits the emergence of a trail. This complex dynamics
leads to two following signatures for plasma defocusing:

focus; (ii) Because ρ scales as R2K, the spatial zone

In addition, circular polarizations on femtosecond ﬁla-

(Kolesik et al., 2001). They moreover weaken the MPI

Compared with plasma formation and chromatic dis-

a limited impact on the nonlinear dynamics. Therefore,
we shall henceforth focus on the ﬁrst two players mainly.

The Kerr eﬀect creates spectral broadening through
self-phase modulation (SPM). The solving for i∂zψ =

modulation experienced by the optical ﬁeld during its
propagation. This intensity-dependent phase shift is re-
sponsible for spectral broadening by virtue of the relation
∆ω =
∂targ(ψ) (Agrawal, 2001; Shen, 1984). Because
the frequency spectrum is expanded by the nonlinearity,
SPM leads to supercontinuum generation and white-light
emission, as the wave intensity strongly increases through
the self-focusing process. With plasma generation, this
phenomenon can be described by employing the following
approximations. First, we assume that the MPI response
behaves like a static density plateau [see, e.g., Fig. 9(f)],

so that the ratio ρ/

ing with t0 = 0 represent the early symmetric broaden-
ing through SPM (Yang and Shen, 1984). When MPI
forms a defocusing plateau, ∆λ/λ0 then becomes larger
in the region where ρ = 0 (non-defocused leading pulse),
A2 (defocused trail). Consequently, as
than when ρ
the beam reaches the ﬁrst focus point zc, the dominant
part of the pulse is the front edge (ρ = 0) and MPI
creates a primary redshift (Lehner and Auby, 2000). In
the trail, full plasma coupling (ρ/A2
1) limits the
spectral enlargement to the opposite side. However, self-
steepening induced at increasing Q inhibits the MPI red-
shifting and instead displaces more the spectrum to the
blue side. As a result, this creates an asymmetric spectral
broadening with a prominent blueshift ∆λ < 0 for τ >
0 (Berkovsky et al., 2005; Champeaux and Berg´e, 2003;
Gaeta, 2000; Ward and Berg´e, 2003; Yang and Shen,

source of ionization (scaling as I K in MPI regime), how-

F. Modulational instabilities: The route to multiple
ﬁlamentation

In the context of nonlinear optics, an intense wave
propagating in a focusing Kerr medium can break
up into several spots from the inhomogeneities aﬀect-
ing its initial distribution.
This phenomenon was
ﬁrst evidenced by self-focusing experiments in liquids
(Bespalov and Talanov, 1966; Campillo et al., 1973) and
the resulting small-scale structures are usually named
”ﬁlaments”. Because it mostly concerns spatial distor-
tions, this process of ”multiﬁlamentation” can be un-
derstood from Eqs. (51), where temporal variations are
discarded. (2 + 1)-dimensional models freezing tempo-
ral dependencies were used to simulate the early ﬁla-
mentation stage of high-power beams in various trans-
parent media, yielding rather good qualitative agree-
ments with experimental measurements (Dubietis et al.,
2004a,c; Fibich et al., 2005, 2004; Kandidov et al., 2005,
1999; Porras et al., 2004). In plasma regimes, 2D mod-

els can also simulate complex multiﬁlamentation patterns
created from terawatt laser pulses (Berg´e et al., 2004;
Skupin et al., 2004b). For instance, by assuming that
MPI mainly counterbalances Kerr focusing at a dominant
time slice t = tc(z), the ﬁeld envelope can be decomposed
as ψ = ˜ψ(x, y, z)
χ[t, tc(z)] where the temporal distri-
bution for the highest-intensity peak is modeled by the
Gaussian χ[t, tc(z)] = e−
with constant extent
τ . Plugging the above expression into Eqs. (51), comput-
ing the expression of ρ and averaging the result over the
entire time domain supplies the extended NLS equation
for the spatial proﬁle ˜ψ:

where the coeﬃcient α averages the Raman delayed re-
sponse. This model does not formally depend on the
longitudinal location of the time slice t = tc(z). The
only arbitrariness is the choice of the peak duration τ .
Because MPI shortens pulses to mean duration reaching
1/10 of their initial values, the value τ = 0.1 was found
to provide the best approximations of ﬂuence patterns
developed by (3 + 1)-dimensional fs pulses.

Modeling ﬁlament formation then requires a perturba-
tion theory involving a steady-state solution, expressed
as ˜ψs(~r, z) = φ(~r)eiλz. Deﬁned in the limit of no dissipa-

Because they constitute rough representations of phys-
ical beams, plane waves can be replaced by the soliton
modes of the NLS equation (72). The resulting instability
appears when a soliton φ is perturbed by oscillatory mod-
ulations developing along one transverse axis. Perturba-
tions are, e.g., local in x and they promote the forma-
tion of bunches periodically distributed over the y axis.

In this regards, solitary waveforms having a ring-

ity with an integer number of windings, m (topologi-

tices”. They convey a constant orbital angular momen-
tum (Kruglov et al., 1992; Kruglov and Vlasov, 1985)

masks and holographic techniques (Desyatnikov et al.,

tion. It has detrimental consequences on the quality of
the beam shape.

IV. UNIVERSAL FEATURES OF FEMTOSECOND
FILAMENTATION

For an eﬃcient propagation, the beam intensity and
electron density must both remain below their so-called
”laser-induced breakdown” (LIB) limits. LIB means
the breakdown of the beam that results in damage or
tremendous energy absorption in dielectrics as well as in
liquids (Kennedy, 1995).
It involves three major pro-
cesses, namely, (i) ionization, (ii) heating of the ”free”
electrons by the radiation, and (iii) transfer of plasma
energy to the medium. Once generated, the electron
plasma absorbs and scatters the remaining pulse en-
ergy. Assuming free electrons seeded by avalanche ion-
ization, ∂tρ
(σ/Ui)ρI, an incident pulse launched in
tightly focused geometry will be signiﬁcantly attenuated
by energy absorption at density levels above a critical
value, ρcr. An estimate of the LIB intensity then fol-
(Ui/σtp)ln(ρcr) (Feng et al., 1995). For
lows as ILIB ∼
subpicosecond pulses, multiphoton processes mostly pro-
vide the dominant breakdown mechanism, such that the
(ρcr/ρntσKtp)1/K applies (Feng et al.,
estimate ILIB ∼
1997). Ranges of values for ρcr are often close to
3 in silica or wa-
10% of ρnt (e.g., ρcr = 1021 cm−
ter) when using femtosecond pulses (Lenzner et al., 1998;
Noack and Vogel, 1999).

In what follows, characteristics of ultrashort pulse
propagation are mostly depicted for peak electron densi-
ties less than the LIB threshold. Density levels maintain
the pulse in self-channeled state without signiﬁcant con-
version of beam energy into the plasma.

The self-channeling mechanism relies on the balance
between Kerr focusing and plasma generation. The
most illuminating example is given by ”femtosecond ﬁl-
aments” in air, as presented in Fig. 1. Atmospheric ﬁl-
aments form microstructures exhibiting
150 µm
in FWHM diameter and
1 mJ in energy at infrared
wavelengths (800 nm). They are accompanied by a
strong SPM-induced spectral broadening and cover sev-
eral tens of meters, whenever the input pulse power ex-

Nibbering et al., 1996). Propagation distances in excess
of 200 m were even reported for 60 fs, 795 nm pulses
with 4 mm diameter, traveling thus upon a few Rayleigh
distances z0. These experiments revealed, after a possi-
ble short stage of multiple ﬁlamentation, the emergence
of one robust ﬁlament coupled to electron densities of
a few times 1016 cm−

Modulational instabilities rather aﬀect the early Kerr
stage in the beam propagation. At later stages, the re-
sulting ﬁlaments become fully nonlinear and they may
interact mutually. From the interplay between diﬀrac-
tion and nonlinearity, two ﬁlaments can fuse, when-
ever their separation distance is below a critical value,
function of their individual powers (Berg´e et al., 1997;
McKinstrie and Russell, 1988). With no saturation, each
ﬁlament whose power is above critical creates its own at-
tractor, at which it freely collapses. By including satu-
ration, ﬁlaments with powers above critical are able to
coalesce into an intense central lobe and develop vari-
ous patterns (Konno and Suzuki, 1979). Without any
control, multiﬁlamentation happens as an harmful insta-

2000a). Similar behaviors involving slightly higher peak
intensities were also reported in N2 molecular gases at
diﬀerent pressures (Becker et al., 2001).

The ”moving-focus” model was ﬁrst revisited to
yield qualitative
this phenomenon
explanations of
(Brodeur et al., 1997; Chin et al., 1999a). Though pleas-
ant and rather intuitive, this model, however, failed at de-
scribing the self-guiding of light that persists beyond the
linear focus of convergent beams (Lange et al., 1998b).
The appropriate scenario for long distance propagation,
called ”dynamical spatial replenishment”, was speciﬁed
by numerical simulations. During the focusing stage, the
beam generates a narrow plasma that strongly defocuses
the trailing part of the pulse and creates one leading
peak. Once the intensity decreases enough (via, e.g.,
MPA), plasma generation turns oﬀ. The back pulse can
then refocus, which produces a two-spiked temporal pro-
ﬁle (Mlejnek et al., 1998a,b). In space, plasma defocuses
only the inner part of the beam intensity, so that the
trailing edge decays into spatial rings (Kandidov et al.,
1994). With increasing propagation distances and as the
front pulse intensity decreases, the spatial rings coalesce
under Kerr compression and allow refocusing of the trail.
Although the beam radius may look ”quasi-static”, the
temporal and spatial distributions of the pulse strongly
ﬂuctuate (see, e.g., Figs. 9 and 10). At high enough
powers, self-channeling is supported by several focus-
ing/defocusing cycles triggered from a dynamical inter-
play between multiple, stringent peaks alternating in the
temporal pulse proﬁle. ”Pushed” by steepening eﬀects,
these peaks are responsible for the formation of optical
shocks in the medium. This complex dynamics was re-
ported by several authors, dealing with pulse propagation
either in air (Ak¨ozbek et al., 2001; Berg´e and Couairon,
2000; Chiron et al., 1999; Couairon et al., 2002), in ar-
gon cells (Champeaux and Berg´e, 2003; Nurhuda et al.,
2002a), or even in fused silica (Tzortzakis et al., 2001d).
Because the fundamental scenario for self-channeling
is that aforementioned, estimates for peak intensities
(Imax), electron densities (ρmax) and ﬁlament radius
(Lmin) can be deduced from equating diﬀraction, Kerr
and ionization responses. This yields the simple relations

that for laser wavelengths about 1µm, the requirement
(9) is always fulﬁlled. As inferred from Table I, the criti-
cal power for self-focusing exceeds the GW level in gases,
but remains limited to a few MW in dense materials.

∼

Plasma generation is mostly expected to stop the di-
vergence of the beam caused by self-focusing, except for
speciﬁc values of the parameters Pin/Pcr and δ
k′′
that privilege collapse arrest by dispersion (see Fig. 8).
For λ0 = 800 nm, nonlinear ﬂuorescence techniques
(Liu et al., 2005b) recently revealed that small-scale ﬁl-
aments created in water at powers lower than 8Pcr did
not need plasma saturation. With 38-fs, 110-µm pulses
560 fs2/cm, the normalized dispersion length
and k′′
≃
is δ
4.9, for which the plasma response may indeed
be inhibited, following Fig. 8. Pulses are then subject
to space-frequency coupling from the interplay among
SPM, dispersion and phase mismatching, that produces
conical emission (see below). The energy loss caused
by the conical wave depends on the energy contained in
the colored part of the spectrum. Liu et al. (Liu et al.,
2005b) suggests that if the phase matching width of light
waves whose frequencies experience self-focusing is small
enough compared with the spectral width of the on-
axis laser pulse, the spectral energy going into the self-
focusing components is small and the energy loss caused
by conical emission becomes large. This phase matching
width is all the smaller as GVD is large and the spread
of energy can stop the Kerr focusing without the help of
plasma defocusing at powers moderately above critical.
Nonetheless, there exist diﬀerent scenarios having at-
tracted attention in the past few years. For instance,
research groups led by P. Di Trapani and A. Dubietis
(Dubietis et al., 2004a, 2003; Porras et al., 2004) empha-
sized the apparent absence of free electron emission in
the self-guiding of 527 nm, 200 fs pulses with
100
µm waist and powers up to 10 Pcr, propagating in wa-
ter in loosely focused geometry. Numerical simulations
outlined the ﬁlament reshaping into a nonlinear X (bi-
conical) wave, driven by the combination between lin-
ear diﬀraction, normal GVD, self-focusing and nonlin-
ear losses (Kolesik et al., 2002). Whereas GVD cannot
halt the beam collapse even in these conﬁgurations (δ

ﬁlament energy (Courvoisier et al., 2003). The ﬁlament
rapidly self-heals and seems unaﬀected by the droplet,
so that an energy balance between the ﬁlament core and
the unfocused part of the beam was conjectured to ex-
plain the rebuilding of the pulse. Unfocused parts of the
beam refer to the ”photon bath”, i.e., the low-amplitude
background surrounding the ﬁlament core.

Numerical simulations constrained to the radial sym-
metry reproduced the smallness of the immediate en-
ergy losses in air and the interaction dynamics was sim-
ilar whatever the pulse self-channels in the ﬁrst (lead-
ing edge) or in the second (trailing edge) focusing
stage (Kolesik and Moloney, 2004b). From water ex-
periments (Dubietis et al., 2004b), analogous conclusions
were drawn, which insisted more on the linear contribu-
tion from the outer conical waves to the ﬁlament recon-
struction. The ”active zone” of the photon bath must,
however, keep time slices with power above critical to
re-localize the beam at center. The ﬁlament must also
be somehow delocalized in space, in order to justify the
smallness of energy losses during the collision. Answer-
ing this point, simulations revealed that the breakup of
rotational symmetry of pulsed beams can push the fo-
cusing components, still untouched by the plasma, out
of axis. The defocused time slices diﬀract to the low-
intensity background, but the focusing ones exit out of
center (Skupin et al., 2003, 2002). A femtosecond ﬁla-
ment thus consists of a ”spatially-extended” structure,
whose most intense components can move within a zone
of several hundreds of µm around the origin. Through
a collision, just a few components are involved, which
explains the smallness of the losses. Three-dimensional
simulations enclosing the ﬁlament inside a circular disk
of 300 µm in diameter clearly showed that over the 2 cm
of self-healing the beam components outside this zone
play no signiﬁcant role in the ﬁlament reconstruction
(Skupin et al., 2004a). Some of these results are sum-
marized in Fig. 14. Recent experiments using pinholes to
block the photon bath conﬁrmed these theoretical predic-
tions. The energy reservoir actively feeding the ﬁlament
core was measured within a diameter of 220
440 µm
and was found to contain up to 50% of the pulse energy
(Liu et al., 2005c).

−

Whereas a single ﬁlament appears as a robust object,
broad pulses having many critical powers become sub-
ject to modulational instability. The background energy
reservoir favors energy exchanges between the diﬀerent
optical cells, that focus under Kerr compression and de-
focus by plasma generation. A sea of collapsing spots is
thus nucleated, forming an ”optically turbulent femtosec-
ond light guide” along which nonlinear dissipation con-
sumes small energy per ﬁlament (Mlejnek et al., 1999).
Inside the bundle, the ﬁlaments are able to merge and
relaunch recurrent collapse events at further distances.
They gather into long-range clusters composed of sec-
ondary cells that occur around the primary ﬁlaments
created from the initial beam defects (Berg´e et al., 2004;
Skupin et al., 2004b). For broad pulses (w0 > 1 cm) en-

is too small), normal dispersion plays an important role
by dispersing the most intense time slices of the pulse.
Instead of an extensive production of free electrons, the
nonlinear losses (MPA) inherent to this process more-
over dominate at laser wavelengths as low as 527 nm.
From Eqs. (76a), it is always possible to compute nu-
merically the ratio I ∗/Imax that dictates the MPA ef-
UiρntW (I)/I] compared with plasma defo-
ﬁciency [

quantity

(78)

that scales like n0/(λ0tp). The resulting curve is dis-
played in Fig. 13 for fused silica, water and air at diﬀer-
ent pulse durations. Keldysh ionization rate for crystals
is used for dense media, while the PPT rate is employed
for air (O2 molecules). This ﬁgure shows that the per-
centage of MPA over the emission of free electrons aug-
ments all the more as the laser wavelength is low and the
pulse duration is short. In air, MPA becomes negligible
compared with MPI. For dense materials, Fig. 13 points
out to a sudden change in the inﬂuence of MPA whenever
λ0 < 600 nm. This mainly follows from the dependences
over λ0 of both the critical plasma density (37) and the
photo-ionization rate W (I). As a result, self-focusing is
stopped at lower intensities and the free electron density
is maintained at lower levels (Skupin et al., 2006a).

B. Robustness and multiﬁlamentation

Femtosecond ﬁlaments are remarkably robust, in the
sense that they can propagate over several meters and
even reform after hitting an obstacle. In the atmosphere,
aerosol particles, like water droplets or dust, may have di-
mensions comparable with the ﬁlament diameter, which
could seriously harm the dynamical balance required to
propagate ﬁlaments. However, even opaque droplets as
large as 100 µm in diameter do not block ﬁlamentation.
More intriguing, energy losses are limited to 15% of the

ulational instability of a 42-fs, 3 mm-waisted collimated
pulse in air (Tzortzakis et al., 2001a).
In the presence
of plasma defocusing, ”parent” ﬁlaments develop spatial
rings whose radius increases with z. Two systems of rings
can thus interfere to yield ”child” ﬁlaments. Each focus-
ing spot triggers a plasma sequence that defocuses the
trail pulse and locates the cells at speciﬁc negative in-
stants. The number of ”ﬁlaments” is therefore higher in
intensity than in the beam ﬂuence, which sums up all the
time slices (Champeaux and Berg´e, 2005).

Since multiﬁlamentation emerges from the initial beam
defects, several techniques to control this process in shot-
to-shot, meter-range experiments have been proposed.
Among those, we can mention the introduction of beam
ellipticity (Dubietis et al., 2004c; Grow and Gaeta, 2005)
or of a tilted lens (Fibich et al., 2004) along the opti-
cal path. Strong ﬁeld gradients or forcing aberrations
through phase masks can also be used to control high
intensities over long scales (M´echain et al., 2004). Other
techniques consist in monitoring the ﬁlamentation dis-
tance by changing the beam divergence angle with a de-
formable mirror (Jin et al., 2005). By this method, a
single ﬁlament has been produced with powers as high
as 420 GW, usually yielding multiple ﬁlaments in col-
limated geometry. Alternative methods consist in tun-
ing the focal distance of a telescope setup composed
of divergent and convergent lenses (Fibich et al., 2006;
Liu et al., 2006). Interesting features have recently been
published concerning the fusion, repulsion and spiral co-
propagation of two ﬁlaments, depending on their rela-
tive phase shift and crossing angle, which may further
be used to optimize the propagation range (Xi et al.,
2006). In the same spirit, arrays of diﬀractive microlenses
(Cook et al., 2005) or periodic meshes (Kandidov et al.,
2005) into the propagation path helps in making the mul-
tiﬁlamentation ”more deterministic”. As a matter of fact,
these methods amount to altering the background sur-
face of the beam from which small-scale ﬁlaments can
randomly emerge from modulational instability. Alter-
native ways may be provided by femtosecond optical
vortices (Vin¸cotte and Berg´e, 2005) that keep the ﬁla-
ments rotating along a ring and are nowadays designed
experimentally on fs time scales (Mariyenko et al., 2005;
Vuong et al., 2006). Further explorations should con-
cern optical smoothing techniques breaking the laser spa-
tial or temporal coherence (Marklund and Shukla, 2006).
These techniques are currently employed in laser facili-
ties devoted to the inertial conﬁnement fusion, in order to
homogenize the beam distribution (Donnat et al., 1992;

FIG. 14 (a,b) 3D surface plots of plasma strings in cases of (a)
free propagation or (b) an impact with a 95 µm large droplet
located at z = 0.4 m (see arrow), computed from (3 + 1)-
dimensional numerical simulations. Note the convected com-
ponents at z ∼ 0.65 m, corresponding to the second focusing
sequence when the trail peak takes over the front pulse and

focusing distance is close to the MI ﬁlamentation distance
Imax
1/n2I0, which varies like 1/Pin whenever I0 ≪
zﬁl ∼
(Campillo et al., 1974; Fibich et al., 2005).

For narrower beams, experiments exploring mJ, mm-
waisted pulses (Hosseini et al., 2004a; Liu et al., 2004;
Tzortzakis et al., 2001a) reported the beam breakup into
two ﬁlaments that continue to increase in intensity by
Kerr focusing. Depending on their separation distance
and individual powers, these ﬁlaments can merge. An
example of this fusion mechanism is shown in Fig 15 for
two (plasma-free) optical spots, resulting from the mod-

Labaune et al., 1992).

C. White light generation and Conical emission

Spectral broadening has been the topic of intense inves-
tigations for several decades (Alfano and Shapiro, 1970).
In 1995, Gil’denburg et al. (Gil’denburg et al., 1995) per-
formed 2D numerical simulations of ultrashort focused
electromagnetic waves creating breakdown plasma due to
tunnel gas ionization. High blueshifts of the pulse spec-
1 > 40% were reported.

perimental spectra revealed an ”ultrafast white-light con-
tinuum”. This occurs in a wide variety of condensed and
gaseous media, whenever the input beam power exceeds
the self-focusing threshold, which ﬁxes a striking ”band
gap” for supercontinuum generation (Brodeur and Chin,
1998, 1999). Around the central wavelength of 800 nm,
blueshifts (∆ω+) down to 0.5 µm in wavelength enlarged
2 times the cen-
the spectra at intensities lower than 10−
tral one. Spectral enlargements appeared asymmetric,
with a limited redshift, which could not be explained by
SPM theory alone. Continua emitted from gases were
found narrower (∆ω+ ≃
0.5 ω0) than those for dense me-
1.6 ω0).
dia (∆ω+ ≃
Because this process mixes all spectral components in
the visible range, the core of the ﬁlament evolves like
a white spot, which gives rise to a ”white-light laser”
(Chin et al., 1999b). Noting by ϕ(~r, t) the phase of the
ﬁeld envelope, frequency variations are dictated by

which varies with the superimposed actions of the Kerr
and plasma responses. Near the focus point, only the
front leading edge survives from this interplay and a red-
shift is enhanced by plasma generation. At later dis-
tances, second focusing/defocusing sequences relax the
spectra to the blue side while the redshifted components
decrease in intensity. A salient blueshift around the cen-
tral frequency follows from self-steepening that creates
a shock edge at the back of the pulse and ampliﬁes a
”blue shoulder” in the spectrum (Ak¨ozbek et al., 2001).
This spectral dynamics readily follows from Eq. (70).
Asymmetries caused by the focusing events are impor-
tant: They design the pulse spectrum which will be pre-
served after the nonlinear stage of the beam.

The pulse spectrum is usually computed from the
Fourier transform of the ﬁeld intensity, either at r = 0,
or being averaged over the ﬁlament radius, Sﬁl(ω) =
2rdr. More insights can be obtained

where θx = kx/k, θy = ky/k are the angles at which dif-
ferent frequency components ω propagate in the medium.
The dependence of the angle θ = θx = θy on wavelength
deﬁnes the supercontinuum cone emission and is obtained
by means of the expression λ = 2πc/ω. Surface plots of
ln S(λ, θ) compared with the spatio-temporal intensity
distributions ﬁgure out a conical emission (CE) driven
by ”wings” directed to non-zero angles and connected
with the plasma-induced spatial rings (Kandidov et al.,
2004, 2003). Nibbering, Kosareva et al. (Kosareva et al.,
1997; Nibbering et al., 1996) ﬁrst revealed the existence
of this conical emission accompanying femtosecond ﬁla-
mentation in air at 800 nm. Recalled in Fig. 16(a), CE

This angle depends on the spatial intensity distribution
of the pulse, which strongly evolves in self-channeling
regime, as illustrated in Figs. 16(b,c,d,e). By compar-
ing the radial dependences of the divergence angle θ(r),
low-frequency components are located nearest the optical
axis. High-frequency components lie near the periphery
rings and their radiation is directed out of the axis.

Besides Kerr and plasma eﬀects, the material disper-
sion can play a relevant role in condensed media, for
which the GVD coeﬃcient is usually high. Kolesik et
al. (Kolesik et al., 2003a,b) compared the extension of
supercontinuum wings generated in air (k′′ = 0.2 fs2/cm
at 800 nm) and in water (k′′ = 500 fs2/cm at 400 nm).
Numerical simulations accounting for the complete linear
dispersion relation displayed evidence of that chromatic
dispersion becomes a key player (for water above all) in
determining the spectral extent of supercontinuum gen-
eration: Full chromatic dispersion included in k(ω) en-
1 operators when passing to an en-
compasses the T, T −
velope description (see Sec. II). These operators induce
steepening of the pulse proﬁle and strongly ”blueshift”
the spectra.

On the other hand, spectral broadening becomes en-
hanced by harmonic generation. The question of cou-
pling ultrafast IR components with self-induced third-
harmonics was raised ten years ago (Backus et al., 1996).
While conversion eﬃciency as high as 0.1% was ﬁrst re-
ported for third-harmonic (TH) generation in air, higher
eﬃciencies up to 0.2% were next achieved by using fo-
cused pulses ﬁlamenting over only

nm results in supercontinuum generation extending down
to 230 nm in air and yielding a continuous spectral
band of UV-visible wavelengths (Th´eberge et al., 2005b).
This phenomenon was observed over laboratory scales
as well as over LIDAR propagation distances > 200
m (Berg´e et al., 2005; M´ejean et al., 2006b). Numerical
simulations evidenced that UV-visible spectral broaden-
ing is created by the overlap of redshift from the TH com-
ponent and blueshift from the IR pump, ∆ωj =
∂tϕj
(j = ω, 3ω), fulﬁlling the phase-locking constraint ∆ϕ =
π mentioned above. Also, TH-induced saturation rein-
forces the defocusing action of the electron plasma and
enlarges the conical emission to
0.25◦ at 0.26 µm.
UV-visible supercontinuum generation in air is plotted
in Figs. 17(a,b) for a meter-range propagation of one
ﬁlament. Numerical results reproduce the experimental
500 nm at the
data in the wavelength domain 200
same distances after the nonlinear focus (∆z = z
zc).
Fig. 17(c) illustrates the maximum TH and pump intensi-
ties, calculated from a propagation model accounting for
TH generation [see Eqs. (67)] without steepening terms.
Resembling spectral dynamics have also been reported
from 45-fs, 1-mJ infrared pulses propagating in argon
at atmospheric pressure, after subsequent compression
by chirped mirrors (Trushin et al., 2005). Simulations of
these experiments (Ak¨ozbek et al., 2006) were performed
from the one-component NEE model (45) in the limit of
weak THG. It was found that temporal gradients inher-
1 operators are suﬃcient to amplify UV
ent to the T, T −
shifts and cover the THG bandwidth for very short pulses
(
10 fs) over short conversion lengths that involve a
≤
limited number of focusing/defocusing cycles. Huge UV
shifts have already been displayed for air propagation in
Fig. 11(d). The issue of knowing under which conditions
steepening eﬀects or THG prevail in the supercontinuum
generation remains open.

D. Role of the laser wavelength

Whereas emphasis was put so far onto optical pulses
delivered by Ti:Sa oscillators operating around 800 nm,
one could wonder whether the propagation dynamics
changes at diﬀerent laser wavelengths. Besides the
Rayleigh length z0, several physical parameters become
modiﬁed when varying λ0, namely,

The Kerr index n2, function of the cubic suscep-
tibility χ(3)
ω0 , decreases inversely proportional to λ0
(Agrawal, 2001; Nibbering et al., 1997).

The photo-ionization rate and the number of pho-
Ui/~ω0 vary
tons consumed by MPI transitions
with λ0. Even though MPI gain and MPA losses
cannot be separated from each other, their respec-
tive inﬂuence changes with λ0 and stresses more
losses at low wavelengths (see Fig. 13).

meter-range distances, the two-colored ﬁlament propa-
gates over longer scales than an IR pulse alone, as the TH

conversion eﬃciency (Berg´e et al., 2005). Experimental
identiﬁcation of the TH component reveals some central
spot surrounded by ring structures embarking most of
the TH energy and having a half-divergence angle of 0.5
mrad (Th´eberge et al., 2005a). This contributes to en-
hance the total conical emission of the beam.

Besides, changes in supercontinuum generation were
numerically addressed by Ak¨ozbek et al. (Ak¨ozbek et al.,
2003), who accounted for THG at other laser wavelengths
such as 1064 nm and 1550 nm. The latter corresponds
to eye-safety and is particularly important for LIDAR
applications. For these wavelengths, the GVD parame-
ters for both pump and TH frequencies are close to each
other. However, the wavevector mismatch strongly de-

niﬁcantly augments at large wavelengths, which allows
higher TH intensities and energy conversion eﬃciency.

More surprising features occur when the laser wave-
length is selected in such a way that k′′ becomes neg-
ative and leads to anomalous dispersion. In that case,
the pulse ceases to be dispersed in time and undergoes
a temporal compression, in addition to the spatial Kerr
focusing. This happens, e.g., in fused silica at λ0 = 1550
280 fs2/cm (see Table I). Re-
nm, for which k′′
cent experiments at this wavelength have shown that col-
lapse events looked ”extended” along the z axis, unlike
the localized events promoted by normal GVD. Plasma
halts the collapse at powers above critical, but anomalous
GVD continues to transfer energy into the collapse re-
gion, resulting in the formation of longer ﬁlaments before
the beam eventually defocuses (Moll and Gaeta, 2004).
The pulse can thus remain conﬁned along several diﬀrac-
tion lengths and develops very narrow, isolated temporal
peaks. A strong temporal compression produces opti-
cal spots whose duration is shrunk to the few-cycle limit
(Berg´e and Skupin, 2005). Sharp shock proﬁles emerge
from this 3D collapsing dynamics and pulse steepening
along each focusing/defocusing event tremendously am-

pending on the material considered, k′′ can turn
from positive (normal GVD) to negative (anoma-
lous GVD), which deeply modiﬁes the spatio-
temporal structure of the beam.

On this topic, propagation studies mostly concerned

atmosphere and ultraviolet ones at, e.g., 248 nm, cre-
ated by an hybrid, frequency-tripled Ti:Sa/KrF excimer

ening attained along a 60-cm long fused-silica hollow ﬁber
ﬁlled with atomic (Ar, Kr) or molecular (N2) gases. Con-
ditions for optimum pulse compression outlined an ap-
propriate combination of SPM and gas dispersion man-
aged by external chirped compensation systems. Pulses
as short as 4.5 fs with output energies up to 70 µJ could
be delivered at 800 nm and 1-kHz repetition rate after
using a chirped-mirror delay line. The potential scalabil-
ity of this system to higher pulse energies was claimed
to hold provided that two conditions are fulﬁlled:
(i)
The laser peak power must be smaller than Pcr; (ii) The
peak intensity must not exceed the ionization threshold,
to preserve a ﬂat spectral phase for an eﬃcient recom-
pression. These two requirements could at that time be
satisﬁed by a delicate tuning of the pressure parameter.

lengths, respectively, with Seﬀ being the eﬀective area
of the beam mode (Nisoli et al., 1997a). This distance is
tuned by the cell length and the local pressure p, in order
to reach the smallest possible pulse duration. Stability of
the beam was insured by selecting the EH11 hybrid mode
with intensity I(r) = I0J 2
0 (2.405r/a), where I0 is the
peak intensity, J0 is the zero-order Bessel function and
a is the capillary radius (Tempea and Brabec, 1998b).
Keeping the beam stable inside the waveguide requires to
limit the excitation of higher-order modes owing to the
nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics. The spectral broad-
ening thus inherently depends on how close the initial
peak power of the beam is to Pcr (Homoelle and Gaeta,
2000). Sub-10 fs pulses are routinely produced through
these techniques (Steinmeyer et al., 1999). They can
even be applied to bulk (BK7 glass) media, from which
pulse shortening by a factor 3-5 and output energies of
220 µJ have been achieved (M´evel et al., 2003).

In this scope, plasma generation may not constitute
a drawback for pulse compression. Tempea and Brabec
(Tempea and Brabec, 1998a) mentioned the possibility
to produce few-cycle optical pulses by compensating the
spectral chirp generated by the plasma nonlinearity with
a dispersive line delay for intense pulses propagating in
ﬁlled-gas hollow ﬁbers. This scenario was experimentally
conﬁrmed by a JILA team (Wagner et al., 2004), who
succeeded in compressing 30 fs pulses to 13 fs in hol-
low argon capillaries, even without any need of external
dispersion compensation. It was recently improved to de-
liver 5 fs, high energy (1 mJ) pulses following the same
scheme supplemented by ampliﬁer systems and chirped-
mirror compressors (Verhoef et al., 2006).

sion through the combined eﬀects of Kerr nonlinearity

temporal distributions of a femtosecond ﬁlament created
in fused silica at 790 nm (k′′ = 370 fs2/cm > 0) and at
1550 nm (k′′ < 0). At 790 nm, normal GVD stretches
the pulse along the time direction. Reversely, at 1550 nm,
anomalous GVD compresses it temporally and makes it
shift to positive instants through third-order dispersion
and self-steepening that push the pulse centroid towards
the region t > 0.

V. ULTRASHORT FILAMENTS IN GASES

This section is devoted to novel trends opened by the
self-guiding of femtosecond pulses over small distances
(< 1 m), such as pulse shortening and high-harmonic
generation. Most of these applications are conducted in
pressurized gas cells, in which the raise of plasma excita-
tions can be controlled by changing the medium pressure.

A. Novel perspectives for pulse shortening

In the last decade, an important challenge has con-
sisted in testing powerful techniques of spectral broad-
ening and ultrabroadband dispersion control, in order
to compress pulses to durations of a few optical cycles
only (τo.c. = λ0/c). Nisoli and co-workers (Nisoli et al.,
1997a,b, 1998) achieved the shortest pulse durations from
1 mJ, 20-fs pulses by manipulating the spectral broad-

∼

tion of free electrons on the leading edge and enable
the rear pulse to refocus at later distances. This pro-
duces a two-peaked temporal distribution whose time
extent is often of the order of the input pulse dura-
tion. Achieving an eﬃcient pulse compression, instead,
requires to isolate one (at least dominant) peak shrunk
in time (Champeaux and Berg´e, 2003).

∼

To realize this challenge, Hauri et al. used a conﬁgura-
tion of two cascaded gas-ﬁlled cells with intermittent dis-
persion compensation for producing sub-mJ light pulses
800 nm (Hauri et al.,
with durations down to 5.7 fs at
2004). The cells were operated at diﬀerent pressures. It
was later suggested that this scheme could be improved
when a single cell with a pressure gradient is used instead,
in order to monitor the refocusing stage of the trail and
create waveforms with a single-cycle temporal signature
(Couairon et al., 2006, 2005). Despite ﬁrst results mainly
directed to higher pulse energies (Suda et al., 2005), fur-
ther eﬀorts are needed to adjust the pressure gradient for
optimum compression to extremely short pulse duration.
Alternatively, Stibenz et al. recently demonstrated an ef-
ﬁcient pure self-compression obliterating the need for any
kind of dispersion compensation, pressure gradients, or
capillaries for beam guiding (Stibenz et al., 2006). The
experimental setup involves beams in convergent geom-
etry with energy up to 5 mJ, w0 = 11 mm, f = 1.5
m, FWHM durations of 45 fs and input powers equal
to 5 times critical. The beam is initially focused and
propagates inside an 1-m long, 50 k-Pa argon cell whose
center is positioned at the location of the geometrical fo-
cus. Output pulses reach durations down to about 10
fs and develop a strong blue-shift, as reported in Figs.
19(a,b). Figure 19(c) details this self-compression mecha-
nism, reproduced numerically from Eqs. (45). First, near

Finally, from z
center, keeping intensity levels above 1013 W/cm2, are
eﬀectively trapped in the ﬁlament, whereas the temporal
wings diﬀract rapidly. A robust, temporally-compressed
structure of 11 fs forms in the core region of the ﬁlament
[Fig. 19(d)]. The pulse center relaxes to a narrow ”waveg-
uide”, preserving its energy at low plasma density levels
(< 1014 cm−
3) after the linear focus. Fig. 19(e) shows
the on-axis intensity spectra, corresponding to this tem-
poral compression. Not shown here, the spectral phase
at the cell exit (z = 2 cm) becomes nearly ﬂat in the blue
wavelengths with tiny variations comprised in the same
proportions as those measured by spectral phase interfer-
ometry for direct electric-ﬁeld reconstruction (SPIDER).
The robustness for this self-compression mechanism was
numerically found limited to rather long f /w0 ratios and
powers around 5 Pcr, in order to avoid another focusing
sequence (Skupin et al., 2006b).

al. (Chen et al., 2006) also succeeded in achieving pulse

pulses with energy < 1 mJ pass through a thin BK7
glass plate, with no subsequent dispersion compensation.
SPIDER and spectral measurements revealed that self-
compression takes place as long as the front pulse focuses
while plasma cuts oﬀ the trail part. At this stage, the
spectrum is marked by a strong redshift. By increasing
the input peak intensity, the back pulse refocuses and
blueshifts the spectrum. Accounting on the balance be-
tween plasma-induced negative chirps and SPM-induced
positive chirps, the spectral output phase was, again,
observed to be ﬂat. All these methods represent new
promising techniques to produce high-energy few-cycle
laser sources in the future.

B. High-order harmonic generation

The possibility to reduce pulse durations to a sin-
gle optical cycle provides ideal conditions for high-
harmonic generation and laser-assisted X-ray photo-
ionization (Drescher et al., 2001). Several fundamental
atomic processes such as inner-shell electronic relaxation
or ionization take place within a fraction of the oscilla-
tion period of visible or near-infrared radiation and they
require very short probes for being investigated. For this
18 sec.)
purpose, bursts of attosecond pulses (1 as = 10−
need to be isolated. This is now feasible by combining
single bursts emitted at extreme ultraviolet (XUV) wave-
lengths and ultrashort lasers, in order to preserve the co-
herence properties at so short time scales. In this micro-
cosm, the ionization processes become crucial, and more
particularly the transient stage of about half laser period
along which an electron is liberated. Developments in at-
tosecond X-ray science have been addressed in several ex-
cellent reviews (Brabec and Krausz, 2000; Pfeifer et al.,
2006; Scrinzi et al., 2006). Subfemtosecond light pulses
can be experimentally obtained by superposing several
high harmonics and making them emit simultaneously.
By controlling their synchronization, pulses of 130 as in
duration have been achieved (Mairesse et al., 2003).

High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) describes the pro-
cess by which laser light at central frequency ω0 is con-
verted into integer multiples of ω0 during the highly non-
In 1993, Corkum
linear interaction with the medium.
(Corkum, 1993) proposed a quasiclassical theory for this
process, which can be divided into three steps:

(i) The electron is freed by ionization and driven away

from the parent ion.

(ii) Since the laser ﬁeld changes its sign over times
about τo.c./2, this electron slows down, stops at a certain
position, then re-accelerates towards the ion.

(iii) When the electron recombines with the nucleus, a
photon with energy equal to Ui plus the electron kinetic
energy is emitted. This gives rise to very high harmonic
orders.

Figure 20 illustrates a typical HHG spectrum. The
harmonic intensity is rapidly decreasing after an almost
ﬂat plateau (λ < 15 nm).
It is terminated by a cut-
oﬀ, signaling the highest harmonics that can be gener-
ated. Among all possible electron trajectories, there in-
deed exists a maximum kinetic energy corresponding to
the maximum photon energy embarked by this process.
The numerical solving for the electron trajectories with
various phases leads this maximum kinetic energy to be

E(t) = E0 cos (ω0t + ϕCE), where the carrier-envelope
phase ϕCE becomes an important parameter for the con-
version eﬃciency into HHG when approaching the optical
cycle (Scrinzi et al., 2006).

In ionized media with symmetry inversion, harmonic
peaks only exist at odd integers multiple of ω0. The
above three-step process repeats every half-cycle of the
laser ﬁeld, so that the Fourier sum in the spectra
makes even harmonics cancel each other along one cy-
cle. The analytical description of this process requires a
quantum-mechanical approach of the dipole moment as-
sociated with the harmonics. To this aim, Lewenstein et
al. (Lewenstein et al., 1994) derived the time-dependent
dipole moment ~d(t) = qeh
that represents

phase integrand and recombination at time t. Stationary
phase conditions yield the information about the electron
trajectories. By Fourier transforming the dipole moment,
the harmonic spectrum can be calculated and it restores
the cut-oﬀ law (83).

The challenging issue is then to describe HHG by ac-
counting for the propagation physics of ultrashort pulses
In 1998, Lange et
having initially a few fs durations.
al. (Lange et al., 1998a) employed self-guided fs pulses
to produce HHG up to the 15th harmonics in noble gases
and maintain the longitudinal coherence of the generated
harmonics. Tamaki et al. (Tamaki et al., 1999) demon-
strated experimentally eﬃcient HHG through the phase-
matched propagation of laser beams in pressurized Ne
with peak intensities up to 1015 W/cm2. By changing the
propagation length, phase-matching magniﬁes the con-
version eﬃciency around the 49th harmonics by 40 times
near the cut-oﬀ region. Tosa et al. (Tosa et al., 2003)

with fs pulses, for which electrons have no time to ef-
ﬁciently couple to the lattice. Du et al.
(Du et al.,
1994) reported a damage threshold ﬂuence higher than
the √tp prediction rule for pulse durations < 10 ps and
they furthermore underlined that short-pulse damage ex-
hibits a deterministic nature, unlike long pulses. A the-
oretical model accounting for MPI, avalanche ionization
and Joule heating stressed the dominant role of photo-
ionization at fs time scales (Stuart et al., 1996). How-
ever, both photo-ionization and avalanche come into play
during the occurrence of damage. Although the role of
the former is initially dominant (Rayner et al., 2005), it
can be masked by avalanche from an initially-high elec-
tron density (> ρc/100) (Tien et al., 1999). To complete
these two processes, the rapid electron decay over
100
fs scales through recombination softens the maximum
electron density for LIB (Li et al., 1999).

Investigations mixing propagation and damage in di-
electrics started from the early 2000’s. Tzortzakis et al.
(Tzortzakis et al., 2001d) observed the 1-cm long self-
channeling of a 160-fs focused pulse conveying 3 critical
powers at 800 nm. The pulse traveled across a fused sil-
ica sample like a narrow waveguide with
20 µm waist.
Local heating caused by the high repetition rate (200
kHz) and damage by local intensities > 10 TW/cm2 were
avoided by making the sample move in the (x, y) plane.
Auto-correlation traces revealed a two-peaked structure
and spectra were asymmetrically broadened, which sig-
naled a pulse splitting driven by plasma. Earlier, Brodeur
and Chin (Brodeur and Chin, 1999) noticed a similar su-
percontinuum in glasses and explained it from the multi-
photon excitation of electrons into the conduction band
at the focus point. The low beam divergence was at-
tributed to the Kerr-lens eﬀect. As an example, Fig.
22(a) shows a transverse photograph of the self-guided
ﬁlament measured at input energy of 2 µJ in fused sil-
ica. Fig. 22(b) details the ﬁlament waist in nonlinear
propagation regime and Fig. 22(c) reproduces this waist
numerically computed from Eqs. (45).

At higher local intensities, the breakdown limit is ap-
proached. Because the plasma generated during break-
down remains at the threshold, a precise control of the
interaction region can be reached with ultrashort pulses.
This property can be used for material processing, medi-
cal laser applications as well as solid-state microelectron-
ics. The major qualitative diﬀerences between damages
caused by short (< 10 ps) and longer pulses (> 50 ps)
appear in the damage morphology: Short pulses ablate
the material, whereas long pulses produce conventional
melting, boiling and fracture. With tightly focused fs
pulses, permanent birefringent structures embedded in
bulk fused silica have been realized over microscopic di-
mensions (Sudrie et al., 1999, 2001). Arrays of paral-
lel grooves formed transmission diﬀraction gratings with
periodically-modiﬁed index changes. Two distinct types
of damages can be created, namely, those consisting of lo-

sities.

ﬁlled with Xe, in which the Kerr response was negligible.
From these results, we easily guess that the next step in
”attosecond” investigations should concern the optimiza-
tion of HHG spectra by means of femtosecond ﬁlaments.
The promising feature of pulse shortening induced by
the balance Kerr/plasma could become an excellent tech-
nique to produce an isolated XUV pulse. Moreover, the
ability to keep the laser pump clamped at suﬃcient high
intensity over several centimeters may magnify the har-
monic signal. For instance, ﬁgure 21 illustrates the am-
plitude of the atomic dipole computed numerically for
a plane-wave pulse traversing an argon cell pressurized
at 60 kPa for two diﬀerent pump intensities. The HHG
spectrum becomes magniﬁed at intensity levels close to
100 TW/cm2. This preliminary result keeps us conﬁdent
with obtaining harmonic signals with high enough energy
level.

VI. ULTRASHORT FILAMENTS IN DENSE MEDIA

Below, we review major physical aspects of ultrashort

ﬁlaments in solid dielectrics and in liquids.

A. Pulse propagation in dielectrics and damages

Transparent dielectrics such as SiO2 samples were rou-
tinely examined during the 90s, in the framework of the
optical breakdown on the one hand (see Sec. IV) and of
the carrier trapping dynamics of band-gap crystals on
the other hand. One of the key parameters being the
potential gap (which is the energy diﬀerence between va-
lence and conduction band), several investigations were
led to identify this gap in silicon dioxide and to mea-
sure the ultrafast excitation and relaxation of an elec-
tron gas pumped into the conduction band by intense fs
laser pulses (Audebert et al., 1994; Martin et al., 1997;
Tohmon et al., 1989).

Meanwhile, other researches concerned laser-induced
breakdown (LIB) in dielectrics. The threshold damage

30

tions in water (Feng et al., 1997) emphasized the domi-
nant role of cascade ionization for long pulses, while mul-
tiphoton ionization was expected to prevail for shorter
pulses. Further studies (Noack and Vogel, 1999) evalu-
ated the absorption coeﬃcients during the LIB process
for 100 ns down to 100 fs pulses. It was established that
3
a critical density threshold for LIB was ρcr = 1020 cm−
for long (ns) pulses, but ρcr = 1021 cm−
3 for short (ps)
ones. In water and for 100-fs durations, LIB results in
bubble formation supported by thermoelastic eﬀects at
pulse powers above the self-focusing threshold. This pro-
cess also causes refractive index changes in the beam path
upstream over several hundreds of microns. Within wa-
ter droplets the tight focusing and the nonlinearities of
the LIB process moreover generate a nanosized plasma
hot enough to emit in the visible, and preferentially in
the backward direction (Favre et al., 2002).

The ﬁrst experiments on fs pulse self-guiding versus
the optical breakdown limit in water were performed
by Liu and co-workers for diﬀerent focusing geometries
(Liu et al., 2002). It was found that the shorter the fo-
cal length, the larger the transverse size of the optical
breakdown plasma is. Self-focusing drives the initial lo-
calization of the plasma towards the beam axis. White
light is generated along a short (< 1 mm) ﬁlament and
deﬂected at a small constant angle only. The supercon-
tinuum sources for the high-frequencies were identiﬁed in
the rings formed by plasma defocusing and ampliﬁed by
the back of the pulse, where shocklike dynamics blueshift
the spectrum (Kandidov et al., 2004, 2003).

≥

∼

Far below LIB limits, the self-guided propagation of
femtosecond ﬁlaments in water was thoroughly exam-
ined by Dubietis, Di Trapani and their collaborators a
few years ago (Dubietis et al., 2004a, 2003; Porras et al.,
3 µJ, 170-fs clean beam with
2004). By launching a
100 µm FWHM diameter onto a water-ﬁlled cuvette in
∼
5 cm) geometry, a single ﬁlament
loosely focused (f
formed at the wavelength of 527 nm and was capable of
covering up to 4 cm along the propagation axis, while
keeping a mean FWHM diameter of a few tens of µm.
The experiment revealed that the ﬁlament dynamics was
not sustained by a balance between Kerr-induced self-
focusing and plasma-induced defocusing. Numerical sim-
ulations outlined, instead, the spontaneous reshaping of
the beam into a Bessel-type X-wave fulﬁlling the require-
ments of minimum nonlinear losses, maximum stationar-
ity and localization. This scenario has been discussed in
Sec. IV.A, where the important role of the laser wave-
length in selecting the key player able to saturate the
wave collapse and support the self-guiding process was
underlined. For this purpose, Fig. 23(a) illustrates the
pulse ﬂuence along the self-guiding range measured at
the exit plane of a 31-mm long cuvette for Pin = 6.6 Pcr.
Fig. 23(b) shows the X-shaped spectral-angular distribu-
tion of the radiation. Plots (c,d) represent peak intensi-
ties and FWHM diameters reached with similar pulse pa-
rameters with and without plasma gain, which evidences
the weak inﬂuence of plasma defocusing in this dynamics

cal isotropic increase of the refractive index at subcritical
powers, and those inducing local birefringence at powers
above critical. The damage track consists of diﬀusing
20 µm transverse width. The total dam-
zones of
age region can extend over a distance reaching 80 µm
along the optical path. Numerical simulations accounting
for photo-ionization, avalanche, electron recombination
and Kerr self-focusing reproduced experimental damage
tracks (Sudrie et al., 2002, 2001), along which electron
3 resulted from the com-
densities up to 3
bined actions of photo- and impact ionization. Account-
ing moreover for Ohmic heating and thermal cooling by
collisional ionization, Pe˜nano et al. (Pe˜nano et al., 2005)
numerically solved the 1D electromagnetic wave equation
to quantify the transmission, reﬂection and absorption of
100-fs laser pulses by a thin plasma layer formed at the
surface of a dielectrics. With a ﬂuence of 3.2 J/cm2,
the interaction fully ionizes the surface and heats the
plasma to
10 eV. A signiﬁcant transmission up to 30%
of the laser energy is possible even when the plasma den-
sity is above critical (ωpe > ω0). In the layer, the elec-
tron density rapidly becomes supercritical and implies a
sharp rise in the reﬂected pulse amplitude. Compared
with MPI alone, collisional ionization increases the peak
plasma density by 30%.

∼

B. Pulse propagation in liquids and applications

Similarly to LIB in solids, the optical breakdown in ﬂu-
ids gained considerable interest, because it ﬁnds various
therapeutic applications for, e.g., plasma-mediated laser
surgery and prevention of ocular damages. First simula-

31

strated the possibility to arrange ﬁlaments in water into
1D arrays of parallel, non-overlapping spots by clipping
the impinging laser beam by a slit aperture built from ra-
zorblades. Metallic wire meshes can also be used to gen-
erate space-controlled 2D arrays of ﬁlaments. Recently,
Heck et al. demonstrated the eﬃciency of an adaptive
control over the position and extent of ﬁlaments in water
tanks, through a closed feedback loop setup employing a
spatial light modulator and a genetic algorithm that al-
low to manipulate the amplitude and phase of the input
pulse.

Apart from water, other ﬂuids can support fem-
tosecond ﬁlamentation, such as alcohols like ethanol or
methanol. Dyes may be introduced into these liquids,
in order to visualize the ﬁlamentary evolution through
one, two or three-photon ﬂuorescence and modify the
multiﬁlamentation patterns by varying the dye con-
centration (Guyon et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2005a, 2003;
Schroeder and Chin, 2004). Relying on the dye nonlin-
ear absorption, the structural changes of the ﬁlamenta-
tion becomes visible to the eyes, due to the ﬂuorescence
from the dye molecules excited by multiphoton excita-
tions at visible wavelengths. From a dilute solution of
methanol and Rhodamine B, Schroeder and Chin ﬁgured
out that femtosecond ﬁlaments propagate straight, may
die oﬀ prematurely or fuse into new spots. Along the
propagation axis, ”mature” ﬁlaments ending after the
bright ﬂuorescence zone were identiﬁed. By means of
the same techniques, Liu et al. observed multi-focusing
events by increasing the beam energy in methanol doped
with 0.13% of Coumarin 440 at 800 nm. The photon
bath surrounding the 20-µm large ﬁlament core was nu-
merically examined: It was found that the near-axis re-
gion takes energy from a ring-shaped region limited to
r < 60 µm around the ﬁlament core. Outside, the periph-
eral domain (r > 60 µm) acquires energy. The resulting
energetic balance preserves an almost constant energy in
the near-axis region. Nonlinear ﬂuorescence techniques
were recently used to discriminate between multiphoton
absorption and conical emission by z-scan analysis us-
ing metal meshes (Liu et al., 2005a).
It appears that
the energy loss caused by conversion into CE (40%) is
3%) at powers
much higher than that caused by MPA (
< 8Pcr (see also Sec. IV.A). Finally, Guyon et al. em-
ployed Coumarin 153 in dye-doped cells of ethanol. At
high dye concentration (4 g/l), the ﬁlamentation pattern
was shown to self-organize into a latticelike (hexagonal)
ﬁgure, by letting the two-photon absorption of Coumarin
switch out ﬁlamentary sites in the (x, y) plane. Pump-
dump experiments furthermore revealed that, at all ﬁla-
mentary sites, excited Coumarin molecules could coher-
ently relax by ﬂuorescence and emit in-phase light stim-
ulated by the dump pulse, i.e., a collection of ﬁlaments
can be used as microscopic laser sources in dense media.
Figure 24 summarizes some of these observations.

Increasing more the pulse power leads to multiple ﬁl-
amentation, which has been addressed in a few papers
(Cook et al., 2003; Heck et al., 2006; Schroeder et al.,
2004). By using a cylindrical planoconvex lens, Cook
et al. produced horizontal arrays of stable white-light
ﬁlaments in water at 800 nm, allowing interference ef-
fects between neighboring cells. Similarly to a pair of
Young’s slits, a ﬁlament pair creates interference pat-
terns, which is the signature for a constant phase re-
lationship between the supercontinua generated by the
ﬁlaments (the same property applies to atmospheric ﬁla-
ments; see Sec. VII.A.4). Those thus appear as coherent
sources of white-light. Besides, Schroeder et al. demon-

VII. FILAMENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE: CONVEYING
INTENSE STRUCTURES OVER KILOMETERS

The ﬁnal section is devoted to the medium which orig-
inally served as the ”birthplace” for the science of fem-
tosecond light ﬁlaments, namely, the atmosphere. Spe-
cial emphasis is laid on experimental diagnostics. From
the theoretical point of view, ﬁlamentation in air is mod-
eled from Eqs. (45), using classical dispersion relation in
air (Peck and Reeder, 1972). Although of weaker per-
centage (20% vs 80% in air), dioxygen molecules have
a lower ionization potential than nitrogen and they pro-
vide the dominant species prevailing through ionization
(Couairon et al., 2002).

A. Long-distance propagation and white-light
supercontinuum

1. Temporal chirping and spatial lensing

The propagation of high-power (TW) femtosecond
laser pulses in air has attracted considerable attention
from the pioneering observation of the white-light super-
continuum beyond 10 km (W¨oste et al., 1997). A number
of important practical applications have been suggested,
including remote sensing (Rairoux et al., 2000), directed
energy delivery and artiﬁcial lightning (LaFontaine et al.,
1999a) among others. Because the ﬁlament onset and
length are key parameters for spectroscopic measure-
ments and for depositing high intensities on remote tar-
gets, monitoring these parameters are of utmost im-
portance. To achieve high intensities at remote dis-
tances, a negative frequency chirp can be introduced in
the laser pulse (Alexeev et al., 2004; Wille et al., 2002).
In addition to transverse self-focusing, the pulse under-
goes a temporal compression as it compensates the nor-
mal group-velocity dispersion along the propagation axis.
Chirping eﬀects can be measured by evaluating diﬀer-
ences in the conical emission with and without pulse
chirping (Rodriguez et al., 2004). For instance, the ver-
tical propagation of the Teramobile beam, presented in
Appendix C, was examined from the ground using the 2-
m astronomical telescope of the Th¨uringer Landesstern-

warte (Thuringia State Observatory, Germany). Col-
lected images were a combination of both (i) cross-section
images of the beam impinged on the bottom of clouds or
haze layers acting as screens, and (ii) side imaging of the
Rayleigh-scattered light from the beam over large alti-
tude ranges. Some of these images are shown in Fig. 25
at both the fundamental wavelength and the white-light
continuum. In this case, the altitude was retrieved using
triangulation. Figure 25(b) demonstrates the eﬃciency
of the supercontinuum generation, since its blue spectral
signal has been detected from altitudes beyond 18 km for
appropriate chirping. These experiments demonstrated
for the ﬁrst time the possibility to deliver high-intensities
and generate white light upon variable km distances, by
means of GVD/chirp precompensation techniques. The
same observation assessed that the conical emission bears
two thirds of the overall white-light energy, while the on-
axis, forward-directed central component carries the re-
maining one third.

To modify the ﬁlamentation distance, a chirp is usually
introduced by changing the distance between the gratings
of CPA laser compressors. Applied to the Gaussian pulse

Pulse chirping mixes two essential modiﬁcations. The

ﬁrst one is dictated by the phase
powers above Pcr, a positive chirp C > 0 delays the oc-
currence of the self-focus point, whereas this occurs ear-
lier along the optical path for a negative chirp (C < 0).

The second one results in diminishing the eﬀective pulse
power, which pushes the ﬁrst focus to later propagation
distances and reduces the number of ﬁlaments in case
of multiﬁlamentation, whatever the sign of C may be.
In usual experimental conditions, this second eﬀect pre-
vails over the ﬁrst one. Despite the strong nonlinearities
driving the ﬁlament dynamics, the chirped-induced lin-
ear compression stage still persists with C < 0. It gives
rise to additional focusing events and keeps the beam lo-
calized at distances close to zmin (Golubtsov et al., 2003;
Nuter et al., 2005). Moreover, the generation eﬃciency
of the supercontinuum may vary by several orders of mag-
nitude compared with that of a transform-limited pulse.
The onset distance and longitudinal extent of fs ﬁla-
ments are also conditioned by the initial spatial focusing
geometry. No simple analytical rule exists on this point,
because of the complex spatial distortions destroying the
initial homogeneity of the beam. The ﬁlament length
moreover depends on the energy consumed by plasma
excitation and on the accessible peak intensity. How-
ever, most of the experiments emphasize the use of rather
large ratios f /w0, in order to avoid an immediate plasma
defocusing in tightly focused conﬁguration. This prop-
erty can be refound by integrating the dynamical equa-
tions (59) derived from the two-scale variational method.
The variational principle indicates that at given Pin/Pcr
the ratio f /z0 must be large enough to insure the self-
1, the
trapping condition zc ≤
beam diﬀracts just after the focal point. Figure 26(a)
shows the beam diameter of 100-fs, 1-mm-waisted pulses
in air at Pin = 10 Pcr and various focal lengths f , which
conﬁrms the previous belief. Figure 26(b) represents the
beam extent along the z axis of temporally-chirped pulses

power ratio, for which tC

2. Plasma and optical ﬁeld measurements

Plasma detection relies on the existence of a diﬀerence
of potential produced by the current generated by ion-
ization of air molecules. Working in free atmospheric
medium makes it easy to measure the conductivity of
the plasma channel, that causes a drastic reduction of
air resistivity after the passage of a self-guided ﬁlament.
This conducting column can directly be evidenced by
letting the ﬁlament pass between two copper electrodes
drilled in their center and between which a DC voltage
of typically 1000 V is applied (see Fig. 27). The cur-
rent circulating through the plasma column is then mea-
sured by recording the voltage induced across an external
load resistance (Tzortzakis et al., 1999, 2001c). Knowing

(Tzortzakis et al., 2000b). The principle is here to use
a probe beam that crosses the ﬁlament path under a
small angle. The far ﬁeld image of the probe forms fringe
patterns, that yield a direct measurement of the accu-
mulated phase containing the plasma-induced defocusing
eﬀect. Let us also mention sonographic methods, that
take advantage of the sound signals along the plasma col-
umn (Hao et al., 2005b; Hosseini et al., 2004b; Yu et al.,
2003). This ”acoustic” diagnostics employs a microphone
placed perpendicularly to the channel and recording the
sound signals by a digital oscilloscope. The sound emit-
ted from a plasma string is a portion of the pressure
modulation of an acoustic wave from which the absorbed
optical energy and plasma density are deduced from the
electric peak voltage at a given distance z. By doing so,
the variations in the electron density can then be plotted
along the propagation axis.

Plasma lengths attained from single

mJ femtosec-
ond pulses currently remain of the order of the meter.
The combination of twin pulses, launched collinearly in
convergent geometry and separated from each other by
a suitable time delay, can, however, double this length
(Couairon et al., 2003; Tzortzakis et al., 2003). This
process, called ”concatenation” of plasma ﬁlaments, re-
lies on locking together the ionized channels generated
by each individual pulse. By tuning their focal lenses

the intensity required to produce ionization. Besides
a CCD camera, a spectrometer and second-harmonic

to measure the spatial, spectral and temporal distribu-
tions of the pulse, respectively. The data, collected from
an initially collimated Gaussian beam, showed spatial
and temporal narrowing and spectral broadening at dis-
crete energy levels preceding the ionization stage. They
conﬁrmed a critical power value for nonlinear compres-
sion eﬀects of 11.5 GW for 800 nm pulses, i.e., about
15 GW. Nowadays, several diagnostics such as

Gordon and co-workers (Gordon et al., 2006; Ting et al.,

ﬁlament is propagated into a helium chamber through a
nozzle that creates a sharp air-helium interface. Because
helium has lower Kerr index and higher ionization po-
tential than air, nonlinear focusing and plasma defocus-
ing are arrested at the transition in the chamber. The
ﬁlament then expands due to diﬀraction to larger sizes
and lower intensities. A calibrated portion of energy can
safely be collected and imaged either directly by a CCD
array or through an imaging spectrometer.

3. Multiﬁlamentation

Open-air terawatt laser facilities make it possible to
observe optical focal spots formed by a myriad of ﬁla-
mentary cells for input powers containing several thou-
sands of critical powers in air. The 2D reduced model
(71) using the experimental ﬂuence as initial condition
actually reproduces the evolution of the multiﬁlamenta-
tion pattern over long scales, saving computational re-
sources when one neglects the temporal dimension. As
an example, Fig. 28 shows the overall envelope of the
Teramobile bundle (see Appendix C) launched in parallel
geometry. The initial pulse contains 700 critical powers
and its transverse proﬁle is scanned at diﬀerent propa-
gation distances. Filaments rise from the initial beam
defects, form a crown of dots growing from the diﬀrac-
tion ring and then excite clusters of cells. These clusters,
some of whose are identiﬁed by the labels (1), (2) and
(3), are faithfully reproduced by the numerics. The ﬁl-
ament number remains in the order of Pin/Pﬁl, where
5Pcr is the power in one ﬁlament. At large dis-
Pﬁl ≃
tances, the primary brightest spots decay into secondary
ﬁlaments by exchanging power through the energy reser-
voir formed by the background ﬁeld (Berg´e et al., 2004).
When the focusing geometry is changed, the ﬁlamenta-
tion pattern becomes severely modiﬁed. Figure 29 shows
a longitudinal visualization of the ﬁlaments nucleated in
a beam with 760 Pcr and focal length f = 40 m. The

ments.

pulse coincides with the most powerful one of the second
pulse starting a new plasma column (Berg´e, 2004).

Experiments over a horizontal path provided more in-
formation about the length over which ionized plasma
channels are formed (M´echain et al., 2005a). The inﬂu-
ence of an initial negative chirp enlarging the pulse dura-
tion from 0.2 to 9.6 ps, corresponding to 190 and 4 Pcr at
constant energy (190 mJ), respectively, was especially ex-
amined upon distances up to 2350 m. Whereas ionization
is clearly observed over propagation scales < 50 m for
short pulse durations (0.2 ps), it becomes more and more
sporadic for durations above 3 ps and ceases for 9.6-ps
pulses, i.e., at powers becoming close to critical. In this
1012 W/cm2), mm-waisted
case, a few low-intensity (
∼
spots survive inside the photon bath, still capable of cov-
ering several hundreds of meters. The bundle does not
convey enough power to trigger full ionization. Instead,
the beam evolves in a regime along which GVD is able to
take over MPI and sustain the beam in a conﬁned state
over distances of the order of the input Rayleigh length
(Champeaux and Berg´e, 2005). When the initial power
is too weak, broad beams may produce a few bright spots
by modulational instability, but none of these is capable
of developing extensive plasma sequences (see Fig. 8).

Several diagnostics exist for optical ﬁeld measure-

by a thick glass plate placed on the propagation axis at
45◦ angle (Fig. 27). The weak reﬂection from the glass

is then imaged with a high-aperture lens onto a linear
charge coupled device (CCD) camera (Tzortzakis et al.,
2001a). Detection is performed out of the highest-
intensity region close to the nonlinear focus, in order to
leave the entrance window of the glass plate undamaged
and keep up the reﬂected beam undistorted. Also, the
high repetition rate of the laser source may not avoid
multi-spot measurements. For this reason, Bernstein

femtosecond ﬁlaments through a multitude of 1 µm large
water droplets randomly-distributed at various densities
in the 10-m long cloud chamber. A ﬁlament is still trans-
mitted through a cloud with an optical thickness as high
as 3.2. For a cloud optical density of 1.2 or below, corre-

Pulse propagation in adverse weather becomes an im-
portant topic for LIDAR applications.
In this scope,
Kandidov et al. addressed the point of the nucleation
of ﬁlaments in a turbulent atmosphere supporting statis-
tical ﬂuctuations of the refractive index (Kandidov et al.,
1999). These ﬂuctuations naturally arise as the medium
becomes, e.g., locally heated. On the basis of a phase
screen model, the cubic NLS equation including statisti-
cal variations of the linear optical index (Kolmogorov tur-
bulence) describes random paths for the nucleation and
position of the nonlinear focus. This focus appears on the
average shorter compared with unperturbed air and the
beam centroid moves along a random path in the (x, y)
plane. This induces a transverse deﬂection of the beam
axis by several mm, which was later observed from exper-
imental averaged data (Chin et al., 2002b). Besides this
beam wandering, femtosecond ﬁlaments keep their posi-

4. White-light generation

∼

The white-light continuum generated in air by ultra-
short laser pulses is essential in view of LIDAR applica-
tions, since it constitutes the light source used in mul-
tipollutant remote sensing. This white light was char-
acterized over the last years, with progressively extend-
ing bandwidths. The supercontinuum has ﬁrst been
characterized in the visible (Alfano and Shapiro, 1970;
Nishioka et al., 1995). J. Kasparian et al. next investi-
gated the infrared region (Kasparian et al., 2000b). Two
diﬀerent terawatt CPA laser systems (A: 60-mJ energy,
35-fs minimal pulse duration, 25-mm FWHM beam di-
ameter; B: 100-200 mJ, 100-fs minimal pulse duration,
35-mm FWHM diameters) produced spectra measured
30 m from the lens, as the laser
at a total distance of
beam was diﬀracting after 20 m of ﬁlament propagation.
Illustrated in Fig. 32(a), the continuum band developed
from laser system A is very broad, extending at least
to 4.5 µm. An almost exponential decay over 4 orders of
magnitude up to 2.5 µm is observed, followed by a slower
decay of one order of magnitude only. As shown from the
inset plotting results from laser system B, variations in
the input energy makes spectral intensity change by only
one decade in some spectral regions. The spectral shape
of these diﬀerent pulses remains, nevertheless, quite sim-
ilar within one decade in spectral intensity. Extension to
the UV-visible domain down to 230 nm (Fig. 17) is not
represented, as it was detected later. For comparison,

single femtosecond ﬁlament has been generated in air by
accounting for third-harmonic generation in the limits

T, T −
model (43). The experimental and numerical spectral
shapes are similar up to 1.2 µm. Diﬀerences, however,
occur at larger wavelengths, as space-time focusing and
self-steepening are included, which shortens the red parts
of the spectrum to some extent. Recovering the experi-
mental redshifts from the UPPE model in air is still an
open issue.

The similarity of white-light spectra emitted by TW
laser pulses (experiments) and GW pulses suggests that
the multiﬁlamentation produces a spectrum analogous to
that generated by a single ﬁlament. This conclusion is
consistent with Chin et al.’s experimental observations
about the coherence properties of femtosecond ﬁlaments
(Chin et al., 2002a). Observation of the interference pat-
tern produced by two or more ﬁlaments allowed to predict
that they emerge in phase from the background ﬁeld and
they possess the same phase relationship. This means
that the laser spectrum around the central wavelength
in the conditions of multiple ﬁlamentation is in principle
identical to that developed by an isolated ﬁlament.

The previous property is important for LIDAR appli-
cations, because it suggests that the comprehension of
the spectral dynamics of one ﬁlament is suﬃcient for
understanding the spectral dynamics of multiﬁlamented

tion stable relatively to the bundle in highly turbulent
regions, as the index variation caused by the nonlinear-
ity exceeds turbulent-induced refractive-index gradients
by two orders of magnitude (Ackermann et al., 2006b).

Furthermore, the inﬂuence of pressure variations on
TW laser pulses was recently investigated. This issue is
timely, as ﬁlaments propagating vertically over several
km undergo an exponential decrease of the local pres-
z/La, where La = 8 km is the at-
sure, p(z) = p0e−
tenuation length for air density (Sprangle et al., 2002).
Pressure variations induce proportional changes in the
GVD coeﬃcient, the Kerr refractive index and molecule
density available for ionization, as recalled by Eq. (82).
At reduced pressure (0.7 atm), experiments performed
at 3230-m altitude above sea level revealed farther ﬁla-
mentation onset and reduction of the ﬁlament number
linked to the decrease of n2(p) by 30% (M´echain et al.,
2005b). The ﬁlamentation process, especially the ﬁla-
ment length, was shown to be qualitatively unaﬀected.
Numerical simulations in this ﬁeld speciﬁed that a sin-
gle atmospheric ﬁlament does not indeed signiﬁcantly
change its self-channeling range and keeps an almost
constant peak intensity.
In contrast, the plasma level,
the ﬁlament width [Eqs. (76)] and the nonlinear focus
(50) evolve with p and √p, respectively, due to the ef-
fective increase of Pcr(n2). Multiﬁlamentation patterns
have their onset distance governed by the maximum rate
1/n2(p)I0 [see Eq.
for modulation instability γmax ∼
(74)]. This length thus varies linearly with air pressure
(Champeaux and Berg´e, 2006).

where they have been backscattered. Such a spatial
resolution, combined with the possibility of sweeping
the laser beam, provides two- and three-dimensional
maps of measured atmospheric species. This is the
main advantage of LIDAR over other measurement
methods for atmospheric trace-gases. One of the most
popular LIDAR techniques is called DIAL (DIﬀerential
Absorbtion Lidar). It allows to selectively measure the
concentration of gaseous pollutants by comparing the
Lidar signals at two wavelengths nearby to one another,
one being on an absorption line of the pollutant, and the
other just beneath. However, this method is basically
limited to pollutants that exhibit a narrow absorption
line without interference from the absorption spectra of
other atmospheric compounds. Moreover, the need to
tune the laser wavelength on the absorption line forbids
to simultaneously identify more than one pollutant
within one acquisition.

Femtosecond Lidars (or so-called ”FemtoLidars”) over-
come classical DIAL limitations. Exploiting the ”Fem-
tosecond atmospheric lamp” discovered in 1997 by W¨oste
et al. (W¨oste et al., 1997), high-power ultrashort laser
pulses can be shined vertically into the sky, where they
generate white-light through the ﬁlamentation mecha-
nism. The backscattered light, recorded with a telescope
linked to a time-gated spectrometer, then provides a fas-
cinating vector for atmospheric research over km ranges
(Rairoux et al., 2000; Rodriguez et al., 2004). The spec-
tral bandwidth developed by fs ﬁlaments is very broad,
since it spans at least from 230 nm in the ultraviolet to
4.5 µm in the mid-infrared (Figure 33). On the spectrum,
the absorption band of water between 1.8 and 2.5 µm is
clearly visible, showing the potential of white-light for
optical remote sensing in the atmosphere.
It also cov-
ers the absorption band of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) between 3 and 3.5 µm. VOCs constitute a family
of organic compounds with strongly overlapping absorp-
tion spectra, which prevents any measurement by clas-
sical DIAL techniques. In addition, the ﬂat continuum
spanning from the visible down to 230 nm through third-
harmonic generation (see Fig. 17) provides a promising
light source for the measurement of trace gases that ab-
sorb in the blue or the UV, such as ozone, toluene, ben-
zene, SO2 or nitrogen oxydes. Recently, femtosecond
laser-induced ﬁlaments were also applied for greenhouse
gaz methane (CH4) in air (Xu et al., 2006a).
Intense
ﬁlaments dissociate pollutant molecules into small frag-
ments, which emit characteristic ﬂuorescence. This can
be used to remotely measure the pollutant concentration
at characteristic spectral lines.

Besides, multiparameter measurements are neces-
sary to monitor the dynamics of atmospheric physico-
chemistry or to remotely analyze a cocktail of species
emitted during a chemical accident. They are also re-
quested to characterize the nucleation and maturation
of clouds. Such processes play an important role for at-
mospheric modeling, both on meteorological and clima-
In particular, the droplet growth and
tological scales.

beams. In addition to the wide spectral region covered by
nonlinear femtosecond pulses, the strong enhancement of
the backscattered photons in ﬁlamentation regime makes
ultrashort laser pulses quite promising tools for the re-
mote identiﬁcation of multipollutants in aerosols. Indeed,
the supercontinuum emitted by a ﬁlament is enhanced in
the backward direction [see Eq. (14)], i.e., towards the
laser source, compared with linear Rayleigh-Mie scatter-
ing (Yu et al., 2001).

In this
technique, a laser pulse is emitted into the atmosphere.
The backscattered light is collected on a telescope and
detected as a function of time, with a typical resolution
of 1-10 nanoseconds. This temporal window yields
a high spatial resolution, since the ﬂight time of the
detected photons is directly proportional to the distance

related density have a key inﬂuence on the forecast of
both precipitations and earth albedo. Their characteri-
zation requires continuous measurements of the size dis-
tribution inside the clouds, with a temporal resolution of
a few tens of minutes, compatible with the evaporation
and growth time ranges. While airborne measurements
are too expensive for routine monitoring, radiosound-
ing does not provide the adequate repetition of prob-
ing. Therefore, optical techniques are promising, and
they can be made optimal with fs laser pulses. As an
example, a high-resolution absorption spectrum over a
spectral interval larger than 200 nm is shown in Fig.
34, based on the white-light continuum, providing both
the water vapor concentration and the temperature of
air (Bourayou et al., 2005; Kasparian et al., 2003). Once
combined, these two parameters supply the relative hu-
midity, which is the relevant factor for atmospheric dy-
namics. Moreover, angular measurements of the multi-
ple scattering yield the size distribution and concentra-
tion within the clouds, through an inversion of the laws
of multiple Mie scattering based on a genetic algorithm.
These measurements require the same laser source and
two independent detectors. With fs Lidar setups, they
can be implemented simultaneously so as to yield a com-
plete characterization of the cloud microphysics.

”FemtoLidars” are not restricted to the white-light Li-
dar. The high intensities carried in the ﬁlaments can
generate nonlinear eﬀects in situ on a target. Such non-
linear processes, which include ablation, ionization and
multiphoton-excited ﬂuorescence (M-PEF), constitute a
supplementary information channel for remote sensing.
An example of this technique has been provided by the
remote detection and identiﬁcation of biological aerosols
through 2-PEF Lidar (M´ejean et al., 2004). Here, the
purpose was to detect and locate rapidly a suspect emis-
sion, to map the emitted cloud, and to identify poten-

tially pathogen agents among the multiple background
atmospheric aerosols, including organic compounds such
as soot or pollens. The 2-PEF allowed, for the ﬁrst time,
to remotely identify aerosols simulating biological agents
in air by nonlinear Lidar (Fig. 35). Moreover, collected
signals based on N-PEF become more eﬃcient than Lidar
signals based on 1-PEF for distances above a few kilome-
ters. This is due to two eﬀects: (i) the directional emis-
sion of the N-PEF from the aerosol particles minimizes
the decrease of the collection eﬃciency with increasing
distances (Boutou et al., 2002), and (ii) the visible or
near-infrared wavelengths used for exciting N-PEF, com-
pared to the UV wavelength required for 1-PEF, experi-
ences less attenuation in the atmosphere because of the
1/λ4 dependence of the Rayleigh scattering.

2. Remote ﬁlament-induced breakdown spectroscopy

The ability of the ﬁlaments to remotely deliver in-
tensities as high as 50 TW/cm2 also opens the way
to innovative exploration techniques, such as the ”re-
mote ﬁlament-induced breakdown spectroscopy” (R-
FIBS) (Stelmaszczyk et al., 2004). This consists of a
combination of Lidar and LIB spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS

(Cremers and Knight, 2000; Cremers and Radziemski,
2006) is a versatile tool allowing an elemental analysis of
surfaces of materials such as metals (Angel et al., 2001),
plastics (Jong-Il et al., 2002; Niessner, 1994), minerals
(Knight et al., 2000; Sharma et al., 2003; Wiens et al.,
2002), aerosols, biological materials (Kyuseok et al.,

tion of the surface by a strongly focused pulsed laser,
typically a Nd:YAG laser. The emission spectrum of the
plasma generated at the surface allows a fast analysis,
either qualitative or quantitative, with detection limits
down to a few parts per million (ppm) for some elements.
The use of subpicosecond laser pulses signiﬁcantly en-
hances the reproducibility of the measurements, because
the lower pulse energy limits the heating of the sample
(Albert et al., 2003; Angel et al., 2001; Dou et al., 2003;
Rohwetter et al., 2003). The use of broadband detection
systems makes LIBS a ﬂexible technique which requires
neither preparation of the sample, nor a priori knowl-
edge of the elements to be found. Applications such as
the identiﬁcation of highly radioactive nuclear waste or
real-time monitoring of melted alloys in industrial pro-
cesses require a remote analysis technique. LIBS, which
is suitable for raw samples, is a good candidate in this
regard, since it only requires a direct view to the sample.
However, due to the limited size of the optical compo-
nents, diﬀraction intrinsically limits the intensity that
can be focused on a remote target. On the contrary, self-
guided ﬁlaments can deliver much higher intensities than
the ablation threshold of many species, at distances of
hundreds of meters or even kilometers. So, in R-FIBS
techniques, the laser-generated ﬁlaments are launched
on a remote target, and the light emitted by the ex-
cited plasma plume is collected through a detection setup
comparable to a Lidar-based one (Fig. 36). Although is-
sued from 180 m distances (Stelmaszczyk et al., 2004),
the data suggest that measurements can be dimensioned
up to the kilometer range (Rohwetter et al., 2003). This
technique is currently developed for various applications,
e.g., the monitoring of heritage (Tzortzakis et al., 2006)
or bacteria (Baudelet et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006b).

C. Towards a laser lightning rod

Besides remote sensing applications, ultrashort ﬁla-
ments may give access to the control of lightning strikes.
Classical techniques to trigger lightning have employed
rocket-pulled wires since the 1970’s. However, the num-
ber of rockets available per storm is necessarily lim-
ited and rockets must be launched synchronized with
the raise of the ambient electric ﬁeld. Moreover, the
wire falling down may pollute the measurement as well
as the environment. Therefore, the idea emerged to
apply lasers to control lightning by ionizing the am-
bient air along the beam and forming a conducting
plasma ”wire”. First attempts used nanosecond pulses
(Ball, 1974; Koopman and Wilkerson, 1971; Miki et al.,

FIG. 36 Principle of Remote ﬁlament-induced breakdown
spectroscopy (R-FIBS). Bottom: beam proﬁle near to the

1993). They were unsuccessful, because such lasers
could not produce continuously-ionized plasma chan-
nels. More recently, this ﬁeld was renewed by the ad-
vent of CPA lasers providing higher intensities in shorter
pulses, therefore avoiding laser absorption by inverse
bremsstrahlung. Encouraging results have been obtained
using focused ultrashort laser pulses to trigger and guide
high-voltage discharges over several meters in the labora-
tory (Comtois et al., 2000; P´epin et al., 2001; Ting et al.,
2005a). Others have been obtained on smaller scales
using UV ultrashort lasers (Rambo et al., 2001). Since
the ﬁlaments provide a conducting path over several me-
ters or even longer, they are particularly suitable for
the atmosphere. Spectacular experiments with the Ter-
amobile laser installed in a high-voltage facility showed
that ultrashort ﬁlaments can guide discharges over up
to 4.5 m (Ackermann et al., 2006a).
Instead of their
usual erratic path, discharges are guided along the trig-
gering laser beam (Fig. 37). Moreover, the breakdown
voltage is typically reduced by 30% (Rodriguez et al.,
2002). Partly guided discharges also occur in sphere-
plane gaps, providing valuable information about the
mechanism of the initiation and propagation of laser-
triggered streamers, with, e.g., plasma lifetimes of about
1µs (Ackermann et al., 2006a). Furthermore, an artiﬁ-
cial rain does not prevent the laser ﬁlaments from trig-
gering such discharges (Ackermann et al., 2004). Cur-
rent research now focuses on the possibility to extend the
plasma lifetime, in order to increase the guiding length
and improve scalability to the atmosphere. This ap-
proach relies on re-heating and photodetaching electrons
of the plasma channel by subsequent pulses, either in the
nanosecond (Rambo et al., 2001) or in the femtosecond
regime (Hao et al., 2005a). Although high laser powers
are usually believed to eﬃciently detach electrons from
O−2 ions in the plasma, it was recently demonstrated
that a subsequent Nd:YAG laser pulse of moderate en-

40

erty. They even amplify it by cutting the back time slices
of the pulse. An accurate control of plasma generation
should push the frontiers in nonlinear optics and allow
for a precise monitoring of high-order harmonics. The
basic scenario of a dynamical balance between Kerr fo-
cusing and plasma defocusing explains the existence and
the long life of femtosecond ﬁlaments in most of propa-
gation conﬁgurations. This scenario must, however, be
revised at visible wavelengths in condensed materials, in
which chromatic dispersion and nonlinear absorption (at
high enough power) seem to drive the self-guiding mech-
anism through an important conical emission managed
by X-shaped waveforms in normally dispersive regimes.
This aspect requires more investigations. Also, propa-
gation regimes of anomalous dispersion, which promote
temporal compression and may further improve self-
compression techniques, should be deepened.

In the last years, impressive progresses have been made
in the understanding of the nonlinear propagation of
high-power laser pulses over long distances in the atmo-
sphere. For broad beams, multiple ﬁlamentation becomes
more and more controllable by the use of deformable
mirrors and genetic algorithms. Besides classical tech-
niques of linear focusing and phase chirping, this will
soon enable experimentalists to optimize the propagation
range of very powerful pulses. Filaments can therefore be
used to remotely deliver high intensities generating in-
situ nonlinear eﬀects. The spectrum of the white-light
continuum is much broader than that expected a few
years ago, especially in the ultraviolet where the mix-
ing between the fundamental and third harmonics wave-
lengths together with the spectral ampliﬁcation caused
by pulse steepening give rise to a spectral plateau ex-
tending down to 230 nm. These progresses open the
way to applications such as remote sensing of gaseous
pollutants and aerosols by Lidar, LIBS analysis of solid
samples, or the control of high-voltage electric discharges
and lightning strikes. Due to its mobility, the Teramobile
allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of many of these
techniques. These applications will probably be pushed
forward in the future by technological improvements in-
volving more compact systems, diode pumping, as well
as spatial and temporal pulse shaping. Novel active me-
dia, such as Ytterbium doping or OPCPA, also open the
way to new spectral regions, especially the infrared. This
spectral region, where eye-safety constraints are easier to
fulﬁll, is nearer the absorption region of many pollutants,
such as volatile organic compounds. These more ﬂexible
systems will be easier to operate, allowing routine uses
for future industrial or atmospheric applications.

ing of the plasma channel enhances photodetachment,
while the resulting higher electron density boosts in turn
the Joule eﬀect.

These ”femtosecond ﬁlaments” are characterized by sizes
of a few tens up to the hundred of microns and can reach
ultrashort FWHM durations down to the optical cycle
limit. They design new objects, that can be exploited for
delivering few-cycle pulses at very high power levels in
the future. Ionization processes do not break this prop-

APPENDIX A: Ionization rates for atoms and molecules

This appendix details diﬀerent photo-ionization theo-

ries for gases and dense transparent materials.

1. Ionization in gases

To model the generation of free electrons by an in-
tense light ﬁeld interacting with a gaseous medium,
photo-ionization theories were ﬁrst developed for atomic
systems by Keldysh (Keldysh, 1965),
later by Perelo-
mov, Popov and Terent’ev (PPT) (Perelomov et al.,
1966, 1967), before being reﬁned by Ammosov, Delone
and Krainov (ADK) twenty years after (Ammosov et al.,
1986). More recently, Tong et al.
proposed a the-
ory for molecular species in tunnel
ionization regime
(Tong et al., 2002).

Keldysh’s theory is limited to hydrogenoid atoms in
their fundamental electronic state and does not consider
the Coulomb interaction between the leaving electron and
the residual ion. The ionization rate W of an atom ir-

the ionization rate for crystals developed by Keldysh
(Keldysh, 1965). Its analytical evaluation is identical to

APPENDIX C: The Teramobile laser

Field experiments are required to characterize the ﬁla-
mentation over long distances as well as to develop atmo-
spheric applications in real scale. Such experiments de-
mand mobility to perform investigations at adequate lo-
cations. Studies of high-power fs-laser beam propagation
over km-range distances can only be performed outdoors,
where relevant aerosol pollutants take place, e.g., in ur-
ban areas or at industrial sites. Laser-induced lightning
investigations require spots where the lightning proba-
bility is high, as well as test experiments at high voltage
facilities. These considerations clearly deﬁne the need
for a mobile fs-TW laser system, embedded in a standard
freight container-integrated laboratory equipped with the
necessary Lidar detection, power and cooling supplies,
temperature stabilization, vibration control, and an addi-

tional standard Lidar system to assure eye safety. These
speciﬁcations were ﬁrst achieved by the Teramobile sys-
tem (Wille et al., 2002). The laser itself is based on a
Ti:Sapphire CPA oscillator and a Nd:YAG pumped Ti:Sa
ampliﬁcation chain. It provides 350 mJ pulses with 70 fs
duration resulting in a peak power of 5 TW at around 800
nm and with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Its integration
in the reduced space of the mobile laboratory required
a particularly compact design (Fig. 38). The classical
compressor setup has been improved into a chirp gener-
ator to pre-compensate the group velocity dispersion in
air. Combined with an adjustable focus, this permits to
control the location of the onset of ﬁlamentation and its
length. Mechanical and thermal stabilities of the mobile
laboratory are kept under control, so that the Teramo-
bile can be transported to any place in the world and
operated even under adverse weather conditions.

The Teramobile container also includes a Lidar detec-
tion chain based on a 40 cm receiving telescope, a high-
resolution spectrometer equipped with a set of gratings
and detectors allowing simultaneous temporal and spec-
tral analysis of the return signal in a wavelength range
comprised between 190 nm and 2.5 µm.

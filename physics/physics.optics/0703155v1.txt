Abstract

Supercontinuum generation by femtosecond ﬁlaments in air is investigated for diﬀerent laser wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet
to infrared. Particular attention is paid on the role of third-harmonic generation and temporal steepening eﬀects, which enlarge the
blue part of the spectrum. A unidirectional pulse propagation model and nonlinear evolution equations are numerically integrated
and their results are compared. Apart from the choice of the central wavelength, we emphasize the importance of the saturation
intensity reached by self-guided pulses, together with their temporal duration and propagation length as key players acting on
both supercontinuum generation of the pump wave and emergence of the third harmonics. Maximal broadening is observed for
large wavelengths and long ﬁlamentation ranges.

1. Introduction

Third harmonic (TH) generation and supercontinuum
(SC) emission are two phenomena which have attracted
broad interest in the past years [1,2,3,4,5]. An evident rea-
son is their direct application in atmospheric remote sens-
ing measurements based on LIDAR (LIght Detection And
Ranging) femtosecond laser setups [6]. In this context, spec-
tral broadening originates from complex mechanisms that
drive the long-range propagation of ultrashort pulses, when
they form narrow ﬁlaments in optically-transparent media.
The physics of isolated femtosecond ﬁlaments in air is
nowadays rather well understood (see, e.g., [7] and refer-
ences therein). It involves the competition between Kerr
self-focusing and plasma defocusing, triggered whenever
the input pulse power exceeds the critical power for self-
λ2
0/(2πn0n2). Here, λ0 is the central laser
focusing Pcr ≃
wavelength, n0 = 1 and n2 are the linear and nonlinear re-
fraction indices in air, respectively. For high enough powers,
multiple ﬁlaments nucleated after an early stage of modula-
tional instability have also been widely investigated [7,8,9].
They produce spectral patterns mostly analogous to those
generated by a single ﬁlament, as ﬁlamentary cells emerge

in phase from the background ﬁeld and possess the same
phase link [10]. By comparing Terawatt (TW) multiﬁla-
mented beams with Gigawatt (GW) single ﬁlaments in air,
this property was again veriﬁed in the UV-visible region
(230-500 nm), where femtosecond self-focusing pulses cen-
tered at 800 nm generically produce a tremendous plateau
of wavelengths [11,12,13].

This latter phenomenon has recently become a subject of
inspiration for several researchers. Two scenarios have been
proposed for justifying the build-up of new wavelengths in
the UV-visible range. On the one hand, temporal steep-
ening phenomena undergone by the pump were shown to
deeply modify the ﬁlament spectrum [14]. Full chromatic
dispersion included in the optical ﬁeld wave number k(ω)
aﬀects both the diﬀraction operator and the nonlinearities.
This induces shock-like dynamics at the back edge of the
pulse through space-time focusing and self-steepening ef-
fects, which strongly ”blueshift” the spectra. On the other
hand, spectral broadening becomes enhanced by harmonic
generation. The coupling of TH with an infrared (IR) pump
produces a ”two-colored” ﬁlament from pump intensities
above 10 TW/cm2 [15,16,17]. The amount of pump energy
transferred into TH radiation depends on the linear wave

distances, the TH component can stabilize the pump wave
with about 0.5% conversion eﬃciency [13]. Experimental
and numerical data reported ring structures embarking
most of the TH energy and having a half-divergence an-
gle of about 0.5 mrad [18]. This process contributes to cre-
ate a continuous spectral band of UV-visible wavelengths
[11,13,19].

Resembling spectral dynamics have also been reported
from 1-mJ infrared pulses propagating in argon at atmo-
spheric pressure, after subsequent compression by chirped
mirrors [20]. Simulations of these experiments [21], discard-
ing TH emission, revealed that temporal gradients inherent
to the steepening operators are suﬃcient to amplify UV
shifts and cover the TH bandwidth down to 250 and 210 nm
for initial pulse durations of 10 and 6 fs, respectively. Very
recently, numerical simulations [22] refound this tendency
for atmospheric propagation, i.e., TH generation, while it
aﬀects the pump dynamics to some extent over long ranges,
does not change signiﬁcantly SC spectra, whose variations
are mostly induced by the fundamental ﬁeld in air.

Despite these last results, we are still missing a detailed
understanding of the key parameters which are supposed
to drive SC generation. A ﬁrst important parameter is, of
course, the laser wavelength itself: How does the supercon-
tinuum evolve when λ0 is varied? This question was ad-
dressed in Ref. [11] for various laser wavelengths, at which
some spectral components were seen to merge. However,
the model used a two-envelope approximation (for the
pump and TH ﬁelds, separately). As emphasized in [22],
splitting into TH and SC pump within envelopes becomes
problematic when their respective spectra overlap inside
a wide frequency interval where the basic validity condi-
1 (j = ω, 3ω) may no longer be fulﬁlled.
tion ∆ωj/ωj ≪
Actually, TH radiation produced through the nonlinear
polarization needs to be described self-consistently from a
single equation governing the total real optical ﬁeld. This
model was missing in Refs. [13,19], which made the role of
TH overestimated in the white light emission. Another im-
portant parameter is the length of the self-guiding range:
Successive cycles of focusing and defocusing events pro-
mote the creation of shorter peaks in the pulse temporal
proﬁle and lead to a maximal extension of the spectrum.
A third potential player is the input pulse duration. In
[21], this was shown to aﬀect the spectra in noble gases
for pulses containing a few optical cycles mainly. Clearing
this aspect requires several simulations using distinct pulse
durations and exploiting diﬀerent propagation ranges. In
connection, we demonstrate that spectral enlargements are
directly linked to the level of maximum intensity: Steepen-
ing operators as well as TH radiation broaden all the more
the spectra as the intensity in the ﬁlament is high.

The paper is organized as follows: Sec. 2 presents the
model equations, namely, a unidirectional propagation
equation for the total electric ﬁeld that generates higher-
order harmonics (mostly TH) through Kerr nonlinearities.
Results from this equation will be compared with those
inferred from the ”standard” nonlinear evolution equation

(NEE) for the pump wave. The major diﬀerence between
these two models lies in the production of the TH ﬁeld and
its coupling with the pump wave. Sec. 3 is devoted to the
long-range propagation of 127-fs pulses in air described by
the previous models. Emphasis is put on the inﬂuence of
the central wavelength λ0 (248, 800, 1550 nm). We discuss
spectral modiﬁcations versus the height of Imax, the input
duration, together with the temporal steepening dynamics
and merging between TH and pump spectral bands. Sec. 4
revisits SC for short-range (focused) propagations. It is
shown that Imax becomes closer to analytical evaluations
when the beam develops few focusing/defocusing cycles.
In this conﬁguration, a lesser broadening may be achieved.
Sec. 5 ﬁnally summarizes the generic features resulting
from our analysis.

2. Models for pulse propagation and underlying
physics

Our unidirectional pulse propagation equation (UPPE)
assumes scalar and radially-symmetric approximations. It
also supposes negligible backscattering. These hypotheses
hold as long as the beam keeps transverse extensions larger
than the central laser wavelength and as the nonlinear re-
sponses (together with their longitudinal variations) are
small compared with the linear refraction index. Straight-
forward manipulations of Maxwell equations allow us to
establish the equation for the spectral amplitude of the op-
tical electric ﬁeld in the forward direction as [7]

Concerning the nonlinearities, we assume a linearly

χ(3) keeping a constant value around ω0, so that PNL
contains the instantaneous cubic polarization expressed
as P (3)(r, t) = ǫ0χ(3)

of Raman scattering comes into play when the laser ﬁeld
interacts with anisotropic molecules, in which vibrational
and rotational states are excited. Depending on the tran-
sition frequency Ω13 in three-level molecular systems and
related dipole matrix element µ [24], the Raman response

In the coming analysis, we shall employ the nonlin-

ear refractive indices n2 = 8
10−19 cm2/W for the wavelengths λ0 = 248, 800 and
1
1550 nm, respectively. At 800 nm, we consider a ﬁtted

MPI formulation for the ionization rate, W (I)
10−99 s−1cm16/W8. This
where K = 8 and σ(8) = 2.88
approximation is known to reproduce experimental data
at λ0 = 800 nm rather faithfully [28,30]. For the two other
wavelengths, we lack well established formulations, so we
employ PPT ionization rates. We consider O2 molecules
having the lowest gap potential (Ui = 12.1 eV) as the
main specy undergoing ionization with an eﬀective resid-
ual charge Zeﬀ = 0.53 [31]. All ionization rates used in
the present paper are illustrated in Fig. 1. They yield
saturation intensity below the threshold of 100 TW/cm2
currently claimed in the literature [7,11]. The dispersion
relation for air has been parametrized as in Ref. [32].

Since our outlook is to understand spectral variations
versus the propagation dynamics at diﬀerent wavelengths,
we ﬁnd it instructive to ﬁx the same ratio of input power
over critical, e. g., Pin = 4
Pcr, at all wavelengths. To lo-
cate the Kerr-driven ﬁlamentation onset upon comparable
z scales, we also adjust the ratio of the nonlinear focus zc

2.1. Self-phase modulation and SC generation

In air, dispersion is weak with k′′ . 1 fs2/cm in the
UV as well as in the mid-IR domains. Self-channeling then
mainly relies on the dynamical balance between Kerr self-
focusing and plasma defocusing, so that estimates for peak
intensities (Imax), electron densities (ρmax) and ﬁlament
radius (Lmin) can be deduced from equating diﬀraction,
Kerr and ionization responses in Eq. (13). This yields the
simple relations

to σK I K

max in MPI-like formulation.

The magnitude of Imax directly impacts spectral broad-
ening, which is basically driven by self-phase modulation
(SPM). Because the frequency spectrum is expanded by
the nonlinearity, SPM leads to SC, as the wave intensity
strongly increases through the self-focusing process. Noting
by ϕ(r, t) the phase of the ﬁeld envelope, frequency varia-
tions are dictated in the limit T, T −1

which varies with the superimposed actions of the Kerr and
plasma responses. Near the focus point zc, only the front
edge of the pulse survives from this interplay and a red-
shift is enhanced by plasma generation. At later distances,
second focusing/defocusing sequences attenuate this ﬁrst
tendency. In contrast, when accounting for temporal steep-
ening (T, T −1
= 1), shock edges in the back of the pulse are
created and a ”blue shoulder” appears in the spectrum, to
the detriment of the early redshift [7,14,33,34].

In addition, the cubic polarization generates third-order
harmonics, modeled by the last term of Eq. (4a). In self-
focusing regimes, the third-harmonic intensity usually con-
tributes by a little percentage to the overall beam ﬂuence
[16]. Despite its smallness, this component may act as a sat-
urable nonlinearity for the carrier wave. It lowers the peak
intensity of the pump and contributes to enhance the blue
side of the spectrum after the TH and pump bandwidths
increase and overlap [11,13].

3. Long-range Propagation

We numerically analyze supercontinuum generation for
the three laser wavelengths of 248 nm, 800 nm and 1550
nm. Results of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger-like equation (13)
for the pump envelope involving or not space-time focusing
and self-steepening operators are compared with those of
the unidirectional propagation equation (10) avoiding any
Taylor expansion in the dispersion relation.

Special attention is here given to the long-range prop-
agation, which rather favors several cycles of focusing-
defocusing events. Before proceeding with the above pa-
rameters speciﬁcally, we perform three diﬀerent series of
simulations showing SC at 800 nm, whose results are sum-
marized in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst one concerns direct integrations
of Eq. (10); the second refers to the same pulse described
by Eq. (13), which eludes TH production; the third ap-
proach relies on Eq. (13), in which temporal steepening is
omitted, i.e., T = T −1 = 1.

The insets in Fig. 2 show the on-axis spectra when SC
is maximal. Following the UPPE description, TH, which
6 m, develops a limited redshift, whereas
emerges from zc ∼
SC of the fundamental is widely extending towards the
blue/UV wavelengths [Fig. 2(a)]. Note that, although a
broad plateau occurs in this domain, the TH bandwidth
still appears separated from the pump spectrum. Following
the NEE description, there is no TH generation. However,
SC is so ampliﬁed in the blue region by temporal steepen-
ing eﬀects, that it overlaps the TH zone and simply hides
it [Fig. 2(b)]. Finally, when neglecting temporal steepen-
ing, the pump instead develops a wide redshift (overesti-
mated by plasma coupling) and a much narrower blueshift
[Fig. 2(c)].

A ﬁrst observation can be drawn from Fig. 2: Since TH
is responsible for lowering the saturation intensity of the
pump [13], Imax reached in the UPPE model is lower and
the frequency variations ∆ω
Imax∆z/∆t are diminished
∼
compared with NEE spectra for the pump wave alone.
Apart from this diﬀerence, no signiﬁcant other change was
detected between both these models, so that NEE seems
to be nothing else but the UPPE description subtracted
by the self-generated harmonics [7]. Importantly, omitting
temporal derivatives of the operators T, T −1 imply more
serious discrepancies, as can be seen from Fig. 2.

3.1. Inﬂuence of λ0

We now examine Gaussian pulses at diﬀerent wave-
lengths (248, 800 and 1550 nm) with tp = 127 fs and
Pin/Pcr = 4 as initial conditions for the UPPE model in
). Figures 2(a) and 3 show
parallel geometry (f = +
∞
snapshots of spectra at maximal extent, together with as-
sociated peak intensities and electron densities. We here
specify that no TH generation was included for λ0 = 248
nm, because no reliable data of the dispersion relation
was available for this wavelength. We believe, instead,
that spectral components below 90 nm should be rapidly
absorbed by the medium.

By comparing Figs. 2(a) and 3, it is seen right away that
supercontinuum generation increases with the wavelength.
To quantify this observation we introduce ∆λSC as the to-

tal extension of the on-axis spectra over wavelengths at
10−5 times the maximal spectral intensity. Then a mea-
surement for the eﬀective broadening is the ratio ∆λSC/λ0,
which we ﬁnd close to
1 at 800 nm
1.5 at 1550 nm. A look at the propagation dynam-
and
ics reveals that the self-guiding range is noticeably aug-
mented at longer wavelengths. This can be explained by
the transverse size of the ﬁlament. Equation (16b) gives
an estimate for the beam waist in ﬁlamentation regime.
If we assume comparable Imax for all wavelengths, we de-
duce that the ﬁlament diameter at 1550 nm is about one
order of magnitude larger than that at 248 nm, which is
compatible with our numerical data. Hence, the larger the
wavelength, the slower the ﬁlament is expected to diﬀract.
Moreover, by virtue of the formula for the critical power
λ2
0/n2 and since a ﬁlament conveys a few Pcr [7], it is
Pcr ∝
obvious that IR ﬁlaments contain much more energy than
their UV counterparts. Thus, nonlinear losses along the ﬁl-
amentation range are less dramatic in the IR domain. Due
to the longer propagation range, more focusing/defocusing
events participate in enlarging the spectra at longer wave-
lengths. Figure 4 details the evolution of the ﬁlaments in
the plane (t, z). It is seen that the time window in which the
pulses disperse occupies the length of the input pulse dura-
tion. Although shorter temporal peaks arise through self-
focusing/defocusing events, multi-peaked proﬁles mostly
develop patterns having a whole extent close to tp.

Fig. 4. Temporal evolutions of the pulses shown in Figs. 2(a) and 3 in
the (t, z) plane: (a) λ0 = 248 nm; (b) λ0 = 800 nm; (c) λ0 = 1550 nm.

Before going on, we ﬁnd it worth investigating SC at 1550
nm more thoroughly, in relationship with third-harmonic
generation. Figure 5 plots three of the SC development
stages, ﬁrst when TH and pump components are clearly
separated (z = 10 m), second when they start to merge
(z = 15 m). At the last propagation distance (z = 25 m),
we can observe that, unlike Fig. 2, TH and pump spectra
overlap and make the TH bandwidth not distinguishable.
For comparison, results from the NEE model for the pump
wave alone have also been plotted.

3.2. Inﬂuence of Imax

The impact of the saturation intensity onto SC is in-
vestigated by simply changing the ionization model: By
decreasing the photo-ionization rate artiﬁcially it is pos-
sible to increase Imax and the maximal plasma level ρmax
accordingly. Reversely, increasing W (I) reduces these two
quantities, which can have a direct inﬂuence on the spec-
tral broadening, as inferred from Eq. (18). To study this
point, we concentrate on the wavelength of 1550 nm only,

because it yields the broadest spectra explored so far. Fig-
ure 6 shows the maximal intensity and peak electron den-
sity at this wavelength, when the ionization rate is artiﬁ-
cially increased (see Fig. 1). All other parameters are un-
changed, compared with the simulation shown in Fig. 3(b).
With the original ionization rate, Imax reaches the value
of 80 TW/cm2; with the artiﬁcial one, Imax stays below
13 TW/cm2. The inset in Fig. 6 details the corresponding
spectrum at zmax = 40 m. With low Imax, the TH compo-
nent is reduced to some extent as the pump intensity barely
exceeds the TH conversion threshold [15]. Meanwhile, SC
of the pump driven by the T, T −1 operators in the blue side
decreases, i.e., a lower Imax for analogous pulse compres-
sion implies less sharp temporal gradients and smoother
optical shocks, which weakens blueshifted frequency vari-
ations. These features are visible in Fig. 6, where TH and
pump broadbands remain separated. In Figs. 3(b) and 5(b),
in contrast, SC extends beyond the TH wavelength and in-
creases more the pulse spectrum. Similar features were ob-
served at the two other wavelengths, when the ionization
rate was changed.

3.3. Inﬂuence of tp

We investigate the inﬂuence of the initial pulse duration
on the propagation dynamics and SC generation. Since we
consider transform-limited pulses, the value of tp is directly
linked to the initial spectral width. Moreover, Imax comes
into play in SC generation and is expected to scale as
∼
(1/tp)1/(K−1) [see Eq. (16a)]. Thus, the initial pulse dura-

tion should play a signiﬁcant role in spectral broadening.
To check this assessment, we performed several simulations
using the UPPE model, by varying tp from 20 fs up to
500 fs. Because group-velocity dispersion becomes very ef-
ﬁcient at short pulse durations and may even stop the Kerr
self-focusing at powers too close to critical [35,36], we in-
creased the input power up to 20 Pcr for tp = 20 fs. With
this, we ensure to trigger a ﬁlamentation regime even for
this short input duration.

To illustrate the dependency of Imax upon tp, short wave-
lengths are preferable because the number of photons for
ionization is small. Figure 7 shows maximum intensity, peak
electron density and maximal spectral extent of a 20-fs
pulse at 248 nm. At this wavelength, K = 3 and, follow-
ing Eq. (16a), Imax and ρmax should increase by a factor
2.5 compared to the 127-pulse shown in Fig. 3(a). In-
∼
deed, both quantities are increased by a factor of
2 in
the simulation. Spectral broadening is augmented from 0.5
to 0.8 in terms of ∆λSC/λ0, especially to the blue side.
As explained in Sec. 3.2, this results from the action of
the steepening operators. The overall propagation dynam-
ics, characterized by the ﬁlamentation length and number
of focusing/defocusing cycles are, however, comparable for
both the 20-fs and the 127-fs pulses.

∼

On the other hand, if we increase the initial duration
tp towards the ps time scale, the propagation dynamics
changes drastically. As an example, Figure 8 shows the
temporal evolution of a 500-fs pulse at 800 nm. Compared
with Fig. 4(b) employing tp = 127 fs, the obvious diﬀerence
is the huge number of focusing/defocusing cycles. The ac-
tion of the generated plasma breaks the pulse proﬁle into
a larger number of shorter peaks. With a longer pulse du-
ration, more ”time slices” are available for feeding succes-
sive focusing events. The ﬁlamentation range is increased
and Imax is maintained over several meters. Inspection of
the simulations, however, reveals maximal spectral extent
comparable with that dispayed in Fig. 2(a).

At 1550 nm the inﬂuence of tp on the maximal inten-
sity is much less pronounced, since we have K = 15 [see
Figs. 3(b) and 9]. For all pulse durations, we indeed ob-

80 TW/cm2. This can explain why the max-
serve Imax ∼
imal spectral extension ∆λSC/λ0 is always found between
1.5 and 2, regardless tp may be. The major diﬀerence lies
in the ﬁlamentation range, which increases with the initial
pulse duration. So, there is no signiﬁcant change in SC gen-
eration between short and long pulses over large enough
propagation scales.

This last observation invites us to look at the temporal
proﬁles upon propagation. If the spectral extent is compa-
rable, we might also ﬁnd similar temporal patterns. Indeed,
the on-axis temporal proﬁles shown in Fig. 10 all exhibit
structures with duration of 10-15 fs. It seems that the initial
pulse length tp just determines how many of these peaks
appear, or, in other words, how many focusing/defocusing
cycles the pulse is able to develop upon propagation. An-
other indication for the change in the eﬀective pulse dura-
tion upon propagation is provided by the curve of the in-
tensity maximum in Fig. 9(b): The ﬁrst focusing cycle is
60 TW/cm2, because
halted at slightly lower intensities
in this early stage the peak duration remains of the order
of tp = 500 fs. At later stages, Imax increases as the pulse
undergoes temporal compression.

4. Short-range Propagation

So far, we have analyzed free propagation dynamics
where long ﬁlaments achieve temporal gradients and SC
extents similar to those produced by initially much shorter
pulses. Now, we force all pulses to cover the same short
ﬁlamentation range through a focusing optics (f = 2 m).
Results are shown in Fig. 11 for tp = 20 and 500 fs at
1550 nm. We can check that the maximum intensity Imax
follows the theoretical expectations (16) involving tp. The
short ﬁlamentation range prevents the occurrence of several

In summary, we have revisited recent works on SC gen-
eration versus third harmonic emission, by showing from a
complete UPPE model that spectral enlargements of fem-
tosecond pulses in self-guiding regime are mostly driven by
space-time focusing and self-steepening. TH generation, al-
though changing the pump dynamics, aﬀects the spectra to
a limited extent only. This conclusion corrects some previ-
ous statements [19], based on a propagation model in which
temporal steepening terms were analyzed separately from
an envelope description for TH generation. Going one step
beyond, we have demonstrated the important role of the
saturation intensity in the frequency variations enlarging
both TH and pump broadbands. The input pulse duration
becomes a signiﬁcant player in the spectral extents as long
as pulses do not propagate too far, i.e., they do not let the
temporal proﬁles of the pulse ﬂuctuate so much that many
peaks and sharp gradients can develop along the optical
path. This property is mainly enlightened in short-range
focused geometry and lost in long-range parallel geome-
try. Finally, the role of the central wavelength is preem-
inent: Our numerical simulations displayed evidence that
SC clearly augments with the laser wavelength.

Fig. 11. Peak intensities (solid curves, left-hand side scales) and
peak electron densities (dashed curves, right-hand side scales) of
4 mm waisted pulses with diﬀerent duration and ratio of input power
over critical equal to 4 at λ0 = 1550 nm propagating in focused
geometry (f = 2 m). The insets show on-axis spectra: dotted curves
represent the initial spectra; the solid curves the spectra at the
distance zmax = 2 m where maximal broadening is observed: (a)
tp = 20 fs; (b) tp = 500 fs. (c) and (d) show the respective temporal
evolution for the pulses of (a) and (b) in the (t, z) plane.

focusing/defocusing cycles, especially for the 500-fs pulse.
Hence, although the pulse self-focuses, its temporal extent
remains comparable with tp, as we can see in Figs. 11(c)
and (d). The 20-fs pulse shows signiﬁcant spectral broad-
ening with a visible, broadened TH peak. The 500-fs pulse
is spectrally too narrow to generate supercontinuum over
roughly 1-m ﬁlamentation range. Therefore, the funda-
mental and harmonic peaks clearly stay separated (note
the occurrence of the ﬁfth harmonics at 310 nm, which is
self-consistently described by the UPPE model). Thus, the
initial pulse duration strongly inﬂuences spectral broaden-
ing in conﬁgurations of short ﬁlamentation range mainly,
which is consistent with the numerical results of Ref. [21].

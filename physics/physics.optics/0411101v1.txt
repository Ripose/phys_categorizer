Abstract— We discuss a phase-sensitive technique for remote
interrogation of passive Bragg grating Fabry-Perot resonators.
It is based on Pound-Drever-Hall laser frequency locking, using
radio-frequency phase modulation sidebands to derive an error
signal from the complex optical response, near resonance, of
interferometer. We examine how modulation
a Fabry-Perot
frequency and resonance bandwidth affect this error signal.
Experimental results are presented that demonstrate when the
laser is locked, this method detects differential phase shifts in
the optical carrier relative to its sidebands, due to minute ﬁber
optical path displacements.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HERE has been a large body of work involving ﬁber

Bragg grating sensors over the past two decades [1]–
[4]. Early demonstrations were based on changes in the gross
Bragg wavelength as the gratings were perturbed due to strain
and temperature. As interrogation techniques became more
sophisticated, various signal processing and active fringe side
locking schemes were employed, which dramatically improved
their resolution [4]–[9]. This was further enhanced by re-
ﬁnement of grating design, enabling Fabry-Perot resonators
to be fabricated [10]–[14], which effectively multiply the
phase change due to ﬁber optical path displacements. With
careful control of the grating writing process and appropriate
choice of glass material, a Bragg grating ﬁber Fabry-Perot
(FFP) can now have a ﬁnesse of well over 1000 and a
linewidth of a few MHz [15]. A ﬁber distributed feedback
(DFB) laser can be fabricated when the FFP is written in
a ﬁber ampliﬁer and pumped optically [16]. These lasers
have attracted signiﬁcant interest for use in various schemes
[17], [18] as active sensing elements, where changes in lasing
wavelength due to environmental perturbations are used as the
sensor signal.

The past decade has also seen intense international effort in
attaining direct gravitational wave detection, which demands
unprecedented interferometric sensitivity to measure the strain

of space-time. Towards achieving this ultra resolution, the
Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) laser frequency locking scheme
[19]–[21] is widely used. It is adopted for laser frequency
stabilization [22], [23], interferometer longitudinal control, as
well as gravitational wave signal extraction [24]–[27].

While the PDH frequency locking technique is well-
established with free-space bulk-optical resonators and solid-
state lasers within the gravitational wave community, it can
readily be extended to diode laser stabilization [28], and
guided-wave optics. It has previously been utilized in a ﬁber
laser stabilization scheme, where an Erbium doped ﬁber
laser was referenced to a coated micro resonator [29]. The
PDH locking scheme can be adapted for both low frequency
(<10Hz) quasi-static strain sensing, and dynamic measure-
ments at higher frequencies.

In this paper we will discuss this technique in some detail,
and demonstrate PDH locking for signal extraction in a ﬁber
sensor, with a Bragg grating FFP as the sensing resonator.
Remote interrogation of passive resonators has signiﬁcant
advantages over active DFB lasers as sensing devices. The
problems relating to dopant clustering and relaxation oscilla-
tions in Erbium doped DFB lasers [30]–[35] are completely
avoided, and the undesirable effects of optical pump noise
is eliminated [38]. In addition, the interrogating laser can be
housed in a controlled environment, and any residual intro-
duction of phase noise due to laser intensity ﬂuctuations are
secondary effects. When the chosen interrogating wavelength
is 1550nm, telecoms grade SMF-28 ﬁber can be used for
both laser delivery as well as grating sensor fabrication, with
the dual beneﬁt of low cost and low loss. This removes the
need for more exotic ﬁbers which requires cutoff below the

pump wavelength for single-mode pump delivery. At 0.1-1mW
output power, Erbium doped ﬁber DFB lasers are inherently
inefﬁcient compared with commercially available extra-cavity
diode lasers, used in this work, with >10mW of output power.
This higher laser power improves the signal to shot noise ratio
by up to an order of magnitude. While this output power
can potentially be matched by Er/Yb codoped DFB lasers,
they require complex ﬁber geometry to achieve sufﬁcient
photosensitivity [36], [37]. In addition, frequency instability
due to thermal pump absorption continues to limit their sensing
performance [38]. Remote interrogation, therefore, presents
itself as an elegant and superior sensing solution.

For the purpose of this discussion, we will simplify our
treatment of the FFP as similar to that of a free space

Bragg reﬂectors are broadband, and both the reﬂectors and
resonator refractive index are non-dispersive. At the optical
carrier frequency ν,
the complex reﬂection response of a
lossless FFP formed by two matched reﬂectors separated by
distance L, both with amplitude reﬂection coefﬁcient r, can
be expressed as

of refractive index n; A(ν) and φ(ν) are, respectively, the
amplitude and phase response. The FFP has a full-width half-
maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of ∆ν1/2.

The PDH locking scheme involves interrogating the FFP
with the laser carrier phase modulated at νm, while measuring
the reﬂected power with a photodetector, as illustrated in

these phase difference terms approach π/2 and the expression

that equation 3, and hence equation 2, become zero. This is the
usual lock point of the frequency servo. From equation 2, it is
clear that when the cross term equals 0 (locked to resonance),
the output V (ν) is equal to zero and independent of Pc and Ps.
Hence, when locked, the PDH system is immune to variations
in laser intensity noise to the ﬁrst order. In comparison, a
fringe-side locking technique shows no implicit immunity to
intensity noise, and requires an additional intensity monitor
and subtraction electronics [7].

Figure 2a illustrates the theoretical error signal for the case
of νm/∆ν1/2 = 0.1, while Figure 2b is for the case of
νm/∆ν1/2 = 100, when ν is scanned across the resonance
of a FFP. Figure 2c shows the intermediate case where
νm/∆ν1/2 = 2. The two satellite error signals in Figure
2b are due to the sidebands undergoing the FFP resonance,
whereas in Figure 2c, the error signals due to the carrier and
sidebands merge to form a single and almost square error
signal. The plots assume a resonance linewidth of 150MHz,
and it is interrogated by phase modulation frequencies 15MHz,
1500MHz and 300MHz respectively.

our FFP to be presented in this paper will show that we were

tuning of the laser was actuated by applying a voltage to
the piezo-electric transducer (PZT), which changed the laser
cavity length. The factory calibration speciﬁed that its laser

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The topology of our PDH interrogation of an FFP is
shown in Figure 1. The laser carrier is provided by a New
Focus Vortex 6029, which was an extra-cavity diode laser
with a factory-estimated linewidth of 1MHz, and an intrinsic
300kHz. Its optical wavelength was centered
linewidth of
around 1550.15nm, with about 0.40nm tuning range, which

After passing through the optical isolator, the laser polar-
ization was adjusted to vertical by a half-wave plate before
being modulated at 15MHz by the resonant phase modulator
(New Focus 4003). The phase modulator was driven by a
radio-frequency (RF) signal generator, which also provided
the local oscillator for the demodulation electronics. The
modulated laser beam was coupled with an aspheric lens into
a ﬁber-pigtailed polarization-independent optical circulator,
which was spliced to the FFP. The FFP was held between
a pair of magnetic clamps, with one of the clamps in turn
mounted on a translation stage, so that the Bragg wavelength
could be stretch-tuned to within the laser frequency range. Our
FFP consisted of a pair of nominally matched 13.5dB Bragg
gratings (R
95.5%) each 15mm long, spaced 10mm apart,
fabricated in a single phase-coherent writing process. The
schematic for the UV exposure along the length of the ﬁber
is illustrated in Figure 5. They were written in hydrogenated
SMF-28 ﬁber with no apodization. Both the transmitted and
reﬂected light were collimated back into free space with
ashperic lenses and then focussed onto photodetectors Tx and
Rx, respectively, each with electronic bandwidth of
20MHz.
The optical isolator in the transmitted port eliminated any
parasitic etalon effects due to residual back reﬂections from
the collimating asphere. The RF local oscillator was phase
shifted before being used to mix down the electronic signal
from the reﬂected port. The mixed signal was low-pass ﬁltered
to provide the PDH error signal. The local oscillator phase
shift ψ was optimized experimentally by maximizing the error
signal.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. High resolution ﬁber Fabry-Perot characterization by laser
frequency scanning

A 95Hz voltage ramp of 2Vp-p and 50:50 symmetry was
applied to the laser PZT input to sweep the laser carrier
frequency, which equates to a slope of 380V/s. The intensities
transmitted and reﬂected by the FFP, as measured by the
photodetectors, and the corresponding mixed down experi-
mental error signal were recorded using a digital oscilloscope
while the laser frequency was scanned. They are displayed

in Figures 6a, 6b and 6c, respectively. There were two FFP
resonances within the Bragg grating bandwidth with differing
peak heights and ∆ν1/2’s. These differences were mainly due
to the frequency dependent reﬂectivity of the Bragg grating
pair, thus resulting in differing ﬁnesse at the two resonances.

error signal for our ﬁber Fabry-Perot.

Since the gratings were not apodized during the fabrication
process, we can expect higher reﬂectivity near the center of
their bandwidth, which is conﬁrmed by the higher ﬁnesse and
thus narrower FWHM of the ﬁrst resonator mode. Further,
by comparing the heights of the two peaks in Figure 6a,
we can see that
the lower ﬁnesse resonance is closer to
impedance matching. At this mode, nearly all of the laser
light was transmitted and the reﬂection approached zero. This
difference in transmitted intensity, compared with the under-
coupled high ﬁnesse mode, can be explained by UV induced
loss in the resonator, particularly in the 10mm spacing between
the grating pair. The higher ﬁnesse resonance transmitted less
intensity due to its greater resonator round-trip number, or
total storage time, which resulted in greater total loss while
circulating within the resonator. To reduce this loss, the UV
laser can be easily controlled to avoid ﬁber exposure between
the grating pair during the resonator fabrication process.

The transmission scan and the reﬂected error signal for
the narrower resonance is enlarged in Figure 7a and 7b. The
30µs,
FWHM time for the PZT scan in Figure 7a was
which corresponds to 11.4mV on the PZT. Recalling that the
factory calibration speciﬁed that its laser PZT input provided
12.5GHz/V of tuning, the FWHM bandwidth of this mode can
be determined to be 143MHz. For comparison, the broader
resonance had a FWHM time of 66µs, which implies a ∆ν1/2
bandwidth of 314MHz. The separation between the two peaks
can be seen to be
1.9ms in Figure 6, which infers a free
spectral range of 9GHz. Hence, the narrower mode had a
ﬁnesse of 63, while the broader resonance had a ﬁnesse of
29.

peak-to-peak time of 38µs, which corresponds to νm/∆ν1/2 of
0.05, and an error signal turning point separation to ∆ν1/2
≃
ratio of
0.58. The error signal turning point separation
to ∆ν1/2 ratios for the two modes are close to each other,
and agree with the values as predicted in Figure 3. At these
linewidths, νm is small enough relative to ∆ν1/2 to approach
the asymptotic value of the lower limit.

The peak-to-peak error signal size for the higher ﬁnesse
mode was larger than that of the lower one, as seen in Figure
6c, since the νm/∆ν1/2 for the higher ﬁnesse mode was twice
that of the lower ﬁnesse mode. This was predicted by the
theoretical plot in Figure 4. The error signal peak-to-peak
voltage for the high ﬁnesse mode was measured to be 1.4V,
while that for the lower ﬁnesse resonance was 0.63V. These
two points, for νm/∆ν1/2 of 0.1 and 0.05, are normalized and
overlaid with the theoretical plot in the inset of Figure 4, to
illustrate the region where these two modes were operated.

Assuming an effective refractive index of 1.45, a free
spectral range of 9GHz yields a resonator length of 11.5mm,
implying that the effective reﬂection point of the gratings was

≃

0.75mm inside each grating.
We tested for polarization dependence of the FFP response
with a second half-wave plate before the laser was coupled
into the ﬁber. No visible shift in resonance frequencies were
observed as the waveplate was rotated. This implies that for the
intent and purpose of this application, the UV illumination of
the grating core during the fabrication process can be regarded
as isotropic. Any degeneracy due to parasitic birefringence was
beyond the linewidth resolution of the FFP resonance, as the
two modes provided well behaved error signals free from input
polarization wander effects.

It is evident from Figures 6 and 7 that PZT scanning to
sweep the frequency of the laser, as demonstrated in this exper-
iment, is a simple alternative to the single-sideband modulation
technique for high resolution spectral characterization of ﬁber
gratings [39].

The slope of the error signal through resonance was

≃
19nV/Hz for the higher ﬁnesse mode, and
9nV/Hz for
the lower ﬁnesse mode. Hence the higher ﬁnesse resonance
was our preferred mode for PDH locking, as it provided a

in sensing applications. One should note, however, that while
higher FFP ﬁnesse is preferred for superior sensitivity, the free
running laser frequency noise sets a limit to interferometer
sensitivity.

B. Sensor signal extraction in frequency locked operation

To lock the laser, the voltage ramp from the signal generator
was turned off, and the PZT DC offset voltage tuned slowly
while the transmitted and reﬂected laser intensities were mon-
itored with an oscilloscope. When the laser is nearly resonant
with the chosen FFP peak, the transmitted intensity approaches
its maximum, and the feedback loop was then engaged to
acquire lock. This process was recorded by the digital oscil-
loscope traces shown in Figure 8. The servo ampliﬁer used in
this experiment had a single real pole response with a corner
frequency of 0.03Hz. The total feedback loop had a DC gain
of
1000 and a unity gain bandwidth of around 40Hz. Lock
acquisition was straight forward and once it was acquired, the
system stayed locked for several hours even when subjected
to large environmental noise events. Lock termination occured
when the grating drifted outside the laser tuning range, and this
typically happened after over 3 hours of locked operation.

was a large component of ambient noise at low frequencies as
the FFP was not isolated from laboratory acoustic and thermal
noise. We were able to identify ﬁber violin modes, broadband
acoustic noise, and PZT resonances in this frequency regime.
For example, the large feature at
5 kHz seen in Figure 9 is
due to closed loop excitation of a laser PZT mode.

Figure 10 shows a wider frequency scan of the ambient
frequency noise. It is overlaid with the calculated shot noise
and measured electronic noise. At frequencies above ambient
excitation, the free running frequency noise of the laser limits
300Hz/√Hz. Assuming the laser has a
this measurement to
Lorentzian lineshape with white spectral density of frequency
noise Sf , the 3dB linewidth of the laser ∆νL can be estimated
by [7], [40], [41]

where Sf has units of Hz/√Hz. Thus, the broadband fre-
300Hz/√Hz corresponds to an intrinsic
quency noise of
laser linewidth of
280kHz, which is consistent with the
manufacturer’s estimate of 300kHz.

C. Strain sensitivity, and dynamic range

In a PDH locking scheme, the sensor signal is extracted
by either monitoring the PZT feedback voltage required to
maintain lock within the servo unity gain bandwidth, or by
monitoring the mixer output at frequencies above the unity
gain bandwidth. Environmental stimulations, such as temper-
ature drift as well as stress and strain due to mechanical or
acoustic perturbation, change the resonance condition of the
FFP. This results in both DC and AC voltage change in the
mixer output and the PZT feedback voltage. When the mixer
output is read with a dynamic signal analyzer, information
about these perturbations can be extracted. The signal analyzer
performs a Fast Fourier Transform of the mixer output voltage,
and provides a trace with units in Volts/√Hz. The quotient
of this trace by the slope of the error signal (19nV/Hz) yields
the callibrated measurement in Hz/√Hz. The low frequency
measurement of this mixer output is shown in Figure 9. There

Since 1pm is equivalent to 125MHz at 1550nm, we can infer

slope then gives the shot noise in units of Hz/√Hz. This

limiting shot-noise sensitivity of (16 Hz/√Hz

Within the unity gain bandwidth of the feedback system, the
sensor dynamic range depends on the laser optical frequency
tuning range. Since our laser had a PZT tuning range of
50 GHz, the low frequency dynamic range of this system is
δε/δνB =) 330 µε. Assuming a
limited to (50
breaking stress of > 100 kpsi [37], and a Young’s modulus
104 kpsi [43] for fused silica, the breaking strain
of 1.02
is > 9800 µε. This means that typically, the breaking strain
is well beyond the limited tuning range of the laser used in
this experiment. Above the unity gain bandwidth, the sensor
dynamic range is limited by the FWHM bandwidth of the
resonator to (143
δε/δνB =) 0.9 µε. Hence, for large
dynamic range applications, the preferred operating approach
is to expand the unity gain bandwidth out to a maximum, and
perform in-loop measurements at the laser PZT actuator input.

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented a passive ﬁber sensor interrogation
technique which was adapted from PDH locking, used in
gravitational wave detection. We demonstrated the robust
and stable operation of the simple locking system in ﬁber.
In many applications, we believe this passive technique is
superior to active methods using ﬁber lasers, due to its better
efﬁciency, improved signal to shot-noise ratio, lower cost, and
its suitability for remote sensing. It has an implied broadband
strain sensitivity limit of 2 pε, which is due to the free-
running frequency noise of our laser. With appropriate laser

stabilization prior to FFP interrogation, however, it has the
potential to surpass the pico-strain regime and approach the
fundamental shot noise limit.

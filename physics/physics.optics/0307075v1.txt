Abstract. Based on the scalar Helmholtz equation and the ﬁnite-diﬀerence
approximation, we formulate a matrix eigenvalue problem for the calculation of
propagation constants, β(ω), in micro-structured optical ﬁbres. The method is
applied to index-guiding ﬁbres as well as air-core photonic bandgap ﬁbres, and in
both cases qualitatively correct results are found. The strength of this approach
lies in its very simple numerical implementation and its ability to ﬁnd eigenmodes
at a speciﬁc eigenvalue, which is of great interest, when modelling defect modes
in photonic bandgap ﬁbres.

1. Introduction

Since the ﬁrst results on photonic crystal ﬁbres [1] (PCF) many exciting phenomena
have been reported (for a recent review see e.g. Ref. [2] and references therein). From
the very start, a great emphasis has been on the modelling of the optical properties
and frameworks of high complexity have been developed. In this work, we develop a
“poor man’s approach” which allows for easy implementation and calculation of the
propagation constant, β(ω), in arbitrarily microstructured ﬁbres. Most approaches
start from the fundamental vectorial wave equation for an isotropic dielectric medium

where k = ω/c and ε(r) is the dielectric function, which may be frequency dependent.
For a ﬁbre geometry with ε(r) = ε(x, y), i.e., translational invariance along the z-
direction, we look for solutions of the form H(r) = h(x, y)eiβz. Substituting this
ansatz into the wave equation results in an eigenvalue problem, which determines

it is often emphasized that in general a
fully-vectorial approach is required for quantitative modelling of micro-structured
ﬁbres. Several fully-vectorial approaches have been reported including plane-wave
methods [3, 4], multi-pole methods [5, 6],
localised-function methods [7, 8], and
ﬁnite-element methods [9]. The complicated implementation is common to all these
methods.
In this work, we present a “poor man’s approach” for calculating the
propagation constant, β(ω), in arbitrary dielectric structures. Despite its obvious
shortcomings, we believe it is far more useful for more qualitative studies as well as
for teaching of the physics of micro-structured optical ﬁbres at the introductory level.

2. Theory

2.1. The scalar Helmholtz wave-equation

We start from the scalar Helmholtz wave-equation

with Ψ being the scalar ﬁeld. In this approximation, we have neglected a logarithmic
derivative of the dielectric function at the interfaces between e.g. SiO2 and air. We also
note that polarisation eﬀects and/or degeneracies may only be fully revealed by a fully-
vectorial approach. The strength of the scalar approach is that it is straight forward to
implement and thus serves as an excellent starting point for researchers and students
entering the ﬁeld of micro-structured optical ﬁbres. Furthermore, the Helmholtz
equation (2) allows for an easy incorporation of eﬀects like material dispersion, ε(ω).

2.2. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation

Equation (2) constitutes an eigenvalue problem from which β(ω) can be calculated.
We take the probably most simple approach based on a ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation
of the Laplacian. For a quadratic grid with j labeling the grid points with spacing a
we e.g. get the symmetrized representation of the Laplacian

where K = 1/a. For the dielectric function we have εj = ε(xj , yj) where (xj , yj) is
the coordinates of the jth lattice point. The numerical task thus consists of ﬁnding
eigenvalues of the matrix Θ, which is easily done using standard numerical libraries.
The matrix is highly sparse, symmetric and when the dielectric function is real, it is
even Hermitian. The numerical accuracy of the approximation is of course increased
by decreasing the lattice constant.

2.3. The homogeneous case

In order to estimate the required size of a, we ﬁrst consider the homogeneous case
where εj = ε. This problem is well-known from solid state theory;
it can be
diagonalized by a plane wave ansatz, which results in the usual cosine-band result

where the relative error of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation is less than 9 %, see
Fig. 1. For higher frequencies, the ﬁnite-diﬀerence procedure becomes an inaccurate
approximation to the exact problem, because of artiﬁcial band-structure eﬀects.

2.4. The boundary problem

In principle Θ is inﬁnite and for the implementation we obviously need to truncate
the matrix. This truncation may aﬀect the accuracy of the calculation. However, we
are also faced with the problem of deciding how the ﬁnite-diﬀerence representation of
the diﬀerential operators (in our case the Laplacian) are represented on the boundary
of the calculation domain. This problem arises because calculation of ﬁnite diﬀerences
on the boundary requires the use of points that fall outside the calculation domain.
Thus, we have to determine a proper way of how these non-existing points should be
treated.

In the deﬁnition of the Θ-matrix, we have simply chosen to neglect the points that
fall outside the calculation domain. This is done in order to limit the complexity of the
Θ-matrix, and thereby keep the formulation of the problem as simple as possible. The
consequence of this simpliﬁcation is that we impose the condition that the ﬁeld has to
be zero on the boundaries of the calculation domain. Naturally, this assumption will
have an eﬀect on the accuracy of the calculation, but the better the ﬁeld is conﬁned
within the calculation domain, the better the truncated problem resembles the correct
solution, since a zero amplitude on the boundary becomes a reasonable approximation
in this case.

3. Modelling of Photonic Crystal Fibres

3.1. Numerical Implementation

Once the theory of the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation has been established, the task
of ﬁnding solutions to the scalar wave equation may be viewed as two subproblems.
First, the Θ-matrix has to be created from a given dielectric structure, and secondly
the eigenvalues, β2, and the corresponding eigenvectors, Ψ, have to be found. We
have chosen to make our implementation in Matlab, because it provides eﬀective tools
for solving both these problems.

×

×

To give a more precise description of our implementation, we consider an example
100 grid.
where an arbitrary dielectric structure has been discretisized in a 100
In this case Θ becomes a matrix with 10000
10000 elements, which indicates that
the ﬁnite diﬀerence approach is very demanding in terms of memory consumption.
However, as most of the elements of Θ are zero, it is advantageous to store Θ as
a sparse matrix, which is easily done with the Sparse-type in Matlab. For an n
×
n dielectric structure, we need to store n4 elements in the full representation, while
5n2 elements are required in the sparse representation. Obviously, this gives
only
rise to a dramatic decrease in the memory consumption, and thereby a corresponding
increase in the size of the dielectric structures that may be examined.

The second problem we are faced with, concerns the search for eigenvalues, β2,
and their corresponding eigenvectors Ψ.
In the sparse representation, a complete
diagonalization of the Θ-matrix may be performed, but this straightforward method
has the disadvantage of being numerically heavy (and thus time consuming) since
it calculates all n2 eigenvalues. Typically, we are only interested in solving for a

few eigenvalues, e.g the largest values of β2, and this is a common feature of several
advanced eigensolver libraries. In our implementation we use the EIGS command in
Matlab which is based on the ARPACK-library [11]. As a further advantage, the EIGS
command has the option of ﬁnding eigenvalues around a speciﬁed value, which may
be particularly useful once a region with guided modes has been found.

3.2. Index-guiding Fibres

As a ﬁrst example, the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method is applied to an index-guiding
micro-structured ﬁbre. Figure 2a shows the square dielectric structure used in the
calculation, which we have chosen to discretisize in a 128
128 grid. The dielectric
structure has a width of 3√3Λ, where Λ is the hole spacing, and it consists of air
holes with a diameter of 0.4Λ placed in a silica background (n=1.45). A single air
hole has been omitted in the center of the structure to create a waveguide core. In
the case of index-guiding ﬁbres, the fundamental mode corresponds to the eigenvector
with the largest eigenvalue. Figure 2a shows the ﬁeld distribution of the fundamental
mode calculated at a normalized wavelength of λ/Λ = 0.15, and it is seen to be well
conﬁned to the core region.

(B) The ﬁeld distribution of the
fundamental mode, calculated at a normalized wavelength of λ/Λ = 0.15.

In ﬁgure 3 we have mapped out the eﬀective mode index of the fundamental mode
for several values of the normalized wavelength. For comparison, we have included
a ﬁnite-diﬀerence calculation, where the width of the calculation domain has been
increased to 6√3Λ. Finally, we have included fully-vectorial results for a fully-periodic
hole-structure, with a repeated defect, obtained in a plane-wave basis using periodic
boundary conditions [4]. The dielectric structure used in this calculation consist of 6
simple cells, and is thus similar to the structure in ﬁgure 2a.

By comparing the ﬁnite-diﬀerence calculations for the small and the large
calculation domain, we are able to see the eﬀect of the truncation.
For the
small calculation domain, we ﬁnd that the calculated value of the eﬀective mode-
index decreases rapidly for long normalized wavelengths. This is because the ﬁeld
distribution extends to the edge of the calculation domain, and thus the assumption of

a zero amplitude on the edge is no longer valid. Consequently, the ﬁeld will penetrate
into the air holes, and thereby cause a lowering of the eﬀective mode index. By
increasing the width of the calculation domain, we are able to shift the onset of this
eﬀect towards larger values of the normalized wavelength.

In the comparison between our scalar ﬁnite-diﬀerence approach and a full-
vectorial method, we ﬁnd that the scalar approach gives qualitative correct results
and accounts well for the overall wavelength dependence. However, especially for
the long wavelengths the simple approach becomes inaccurate because of the scalar
approximation, and the scalar approach is seen to overestimate the value of the
eﬀective mode-index. For λ
Λ the strong proximity of the air-holes require a correct
treatment of the air-silica boundary conditions which can only be quantitatively
accounted for by a fully-vectorial approach.

3.3. Photonic Bandgap-guiding Fibres

In the literature, it is often argued that accurate modelling of photonic bandgap
materials requires the use of a full-vectorial method. This is true for all photonic
crystals of practical interest, because it is required that they have a large index-
contrast in order to obtain large bandgaps. However, this may lead to the
incorrect conclusion that photonic bandgaps and defect modes are pure full-vectorial
phenomena. From a theoretical point of view bandgaps do not arise as a consequence
of coupling between ﬁeld components at a dielectric interface, as it is the case in a
full-vectorial method. Rather, they are a fundamental property of applying the wave
equation to a periodic waveguide structure, and thus photonic bandgaps and defect
modes can also exist in a scalar calculation.

modes in a full-vectorial calculation [12].

photonic bandgap ﬁbre, calculated at a normalized wavelength of λ/Λ = 0.7.

A disadvantage of this ﬁnite-diﬀerence implementation is that there is no simple
way of calculating the position of the photonic bandgaps. Therefore, we have used
a full-vectorial planewave-method to calculate the bandaps of an inﬁnite triangular
lattice with a hole diameter of 0.88Λ. Once the position of the photonic bandgaps
have been located, it is possible to search for a defect mode. As already mentioned,
the EIGS -command in Matlab has the useful ability to ﬁnd eigenvectors around a
speciﬁed eigenvalue. This is particularly useful for bandgap ﬁbres, since the defect
mode appears as an isolated eigenmode inside the boundaries of the photonic bandgap.
By choosing a normalized wavelength of λ/Λ = 0.7 and searching for an eigenvalue
for which β
k, the scalar ﬁnite-diﬀerence method ﬁnds a defect mode localized to
the core region. The ﬁeld distribution of this defect mode is shown in ﬁgure 4b.
For simplicity we have chosen to depict the absolute value of the ﬁeld distribution.
Therefore, the 6 lobes surrounding the central defect do in fact have the opposite
amplitude of the ﬁeld inside the defect. These 6 resonances are a common feature of
airguiding ﬁbres, and they are also found in a full-vectorial calculation.

In ﬁgure 5 we have mapped out the eﬀective mode-index for a range of the
normalized wavelength. For comparison we have included the guided modes and the
bandgap edges from a full-vectorial calculation. Both methods are found to predict
the existence of a fundamental and a second-order mode, and a reasonable agreement

is found between the results of the two methods. However, we generally ﬁnd that the
ﬁnite-diﬀerence method overestimates the values of the eﬀective mode-index.

The major diﬀerence between the full-vectorial and the scalar calculation is that
the latter is seen to predict signiﬁcantly increased bandgaps. This naturally gives
rise to a much wider range in which the structure supports a conﬁned mode. The
bandedges in the scalar calculation have been found as the modes that lie just above
and just below the defect modes. As the bandedge-modes are infact cladding modes,
and thus well distributed over the entire cross section of the dielectric structure, they
are more aﬀected by the truncation of the Θ-matrix than the well conﬁned defect
modes. We have tried to increase the width of the calculation domain and also the
number of grid points, but this is not found to have any inﬂuence on the overall result.
It is therefore believed that the increased bandgap size is a consequence of the scalar
approximation.

The ﬁnal result indicates, that although a scalar approach provides great insight
to the basic physics of photonic bandgap ﬁbres, it cannot reveal the complete picture.
This is not really surprising. However, we still believe that this method is of great
interest, mainly due to it simple implementation. Also, the model can easily be
expanded to include periodic boundary conditions and a full-vectorial implementation
is feasible as well.

4. Conclusion

The ﬁeld of photonic crystal ﬁbres has by now existed for almost a decade and the
results of the research eﬀorts will probably soon move inside the classroom and also

be found in text-book material on ﬁbre optics and electro-magnetic theory of photonic
crystals. This also calls for simple approaches to modelling of micro-structured optical
ﬁbres which are easy to implement and which without too much eﬀort can produce
results which are in qualitative agreement with those observed in real micro-structured
ﬁbres. We believe that the present work provides such a simple approach.

In order to limit the complexity of the mathematical formulation of the problem,
we have considered a scalar wave-equation which is solved by means of the most simple
numerical approach to diﬀerential equations; the ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation. With
appropriate boundary conditions this results in a matrix eigenvalue problem. The
matrix, Θ, of this problem is highly sparse and has very simple analytical matrix
elements which only depend on the lattice spacing, the frequency, and the dielectric
function. Thus, no implementation of complicated basis functions is required. For
a given frequency ω the propagation constant β can easily be found by ﬁnding the
eigenvalues of Θ. By the aid of standard numerical routines, we are able to solve
for a speciﬁc number of eigenvalues closest to a speciﬁed value. This is particularly
useful for bandgap guiding ﬁbres, where the modes of interest corresponds to either
the smallest or the largest eigenvalue, but are placed in an interval determined by the
photonic bandgap edges.

In conclusion we ﬁnd that the presented ﬁnite-diﬀerence method, apart from
being simple to implement and despite the extremely simple model, is able to provide
qualitative correct results for both index-guiding and photonic bandgap guiding ﬁbres.
The latter case is quite surprising, since modelling of photonic bandgap eﬀects is
normally associated with full-vectorial methods. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the method
is robust and it is relatively simple to incorporate periodic boundary conditions, or to
expand the model to a full-vectorial method. This holds interesting prospects for a
future development of this method.

We show that useful non-instantaneous nonlinear phase shifts can be obtained
from cascaded quadratic processes in the presence of group velocity mismatch.
The two-ﬁeld nature of the process permits responses that can be eﬀectively
advanced or retarded in time with respect to one of the ﬁelds. There is an
analogy to a generalized Raman-scattering eﬀect, permitting both red and blue
shifts of short pulses. We expect this capability to have many applications in
short-pulse generation and propagation, such as the compensation of Raman-
induced eﬀects and high-quality pulse compression, which we discuss.

Introduction

In the last decade, there has been much interest in the
nonlinear phase shifts produced by the cascaded inter-
actions of two or three waves in quadratic (χ(2)) nonlin-
ear media. Large nonlinear phase shifts of controllable
sign can be generated, and numerous applications can
be envisioned on the basis of such a capability1. The
prototypical quadratic process is second-harmonic gener-
ation (SHG). During the propagation of a fundamental-
frequency (FF) ﬁeld along with its second-harmonic
(SH), the FF accumulates a nonlinear phase shift (ΦN L)
if the process is not phase-matched. With long pulses
(nanosecond-duration in practice) the FF and SH ﬁelds
overlap temporally despite their diﬀerent group veloc-
ities.
In this so-called stationary limit, an eﬀective
Kerr nonlinearity is obtained (except at high inten-
sity, when the fundamental ﬁeld is depleted), and this
can be a surrogate for the bound-electronic cubic (χ(3))
nonlinearity2. The cascade nonlinear phase shift can be
thought of as arising from an eﬀective nonlinear refrac-
tive index, i.e. the real part of an eﬀective susceptibility.
The residual SHG that occurs in the phase-mismatched
process can similarly be considered the analog of two-
photon absorption (the corresponding imaginary part of
the eﬀective susceptibility).

The use of cascaded quadratic processes with ultra-
short pulses is complicated substantially by the group-
velocity mismatch (GVM) between the FF and SH
ﬁelds3,4. GVM causes the ﬁelds to move apart in time,
which reduces their coupling, and thus the magnitude
of the cascade eﬀects. In addition, the temporal proﬁle
of the nonlinear phase shift becomes distorted. Devia-
tions of ΦN L(t) from the pulse intensity proﬁle hamper
or preclude applications that involve soliton-like pulse
shaping. The solution to this problem amounts to re-
covery of the stationary regime: For given value of the
GVM, the phase mismatch is increased so that the cycles
of conversion and back-conversion that generate the non-

linear phase shift occur before the pulses move apart from
each other in time. Liu et al. showed that acceptable
phase-shift quality can be obtained if at least 2 conver-
sion cycles occur per characteristic GVM length LGVM =
5,6.
0.6cτ0/(ng,1 − ng,2), which implies ∆k > 4π/LGVM
Here, c is the speed of light in vacuum, τ0 is the full-
width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the pulse, and ng,1
and ng,2 are the group refractive indices for the FF and
SH, respectively. In the limit of large phase mismatch an
exact replica of a cubic nonlinearity is asymptotically ob-
tained2. The disadvantage of working with large phase
mismatch is reduced magnitude of the nonlinear phase
shift. GVM thus places a strong constraint on applica-
tions of cascade phase shifts. As one example, increas-
ing GVM reduces the fraction of launched pulse energy
that evolves into a soliton, eventually to zero7. To date,
applications of cascade phase shifts with femtosecond
pulses5,8,9,10 have all been demonstrated under station-
ary conditions. Approaching the stationary boundary,
GVM coupled with self-phase modulation has been ob-
served to asymmetrically broaden the pulse spectrum5,11

The nonlinear refraction experienced by an ultrashort
pulse in a cubic nonlinear medium arises predominantly
from bound-electronic and nuclear (i.e. Raman) contri-
butions to the nonlinear response. Here we show that
cascade phase shifts produced under non-stationary con-
ditions mimic the Raman response, with some remark-
able properties. Frequency shifts of controllable sign and
magnitude can be impressed on short pulses. These ef-
fective Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman processes complete
the analogy between cascade nonlinearities and true cu-
bic nonlinearities, while maintaining the new degree of
freedom provided by the quadratic interaction – control
of the process through the phase mismatch. An interest-
ing feature of the non-stationary cascade process is that
it provides a controllable non-instantaneous (and there-
fore nonlocal) nonlinearity. That the GVM alters the
quadratic processes and produces deviations from a Kerr
nonlinearity is well-known4. However, to date these ef-

fects have been perceived as distortions to be avoided.
Just as the ability to control the sign and magnitude
of an eﬀective nonlinear index has enabled a new class
of applications1,6, controllable Raman-like processes can
be expected to create substantial new opportunities. We
can think of cascade nonlinear processes with short pulses
as dividing naturally into two classes, separated by the
criterion for obtaining nonlinear phase shifts that mimic
those of purely electronic origin. With this view, half of
the possibilities have yet to be explored. Some examples
will be discussed.

2. Analytical Approach

The Kerr-like nonlinearity that arises from the χ(2) : χ(2)
process in the stationary limit can be understood qualita-
tively as follows. A small fraction of the FF is converted
to the SH, which accumulates a phase diﬀerence before it
is back-converted. The nonlinear phase shift impressed
on the FF is delayed by one full cycle of conversion and
back-conversion. However, as long as the SH is not dis-
placed temporally from the FF, the phase shift on the
FF will be proportional to its intensity proﬁle (Fig. 1).
With short pulses, the GVM becomes important if the
ﬁelds separate by approximately the pulse duration be-
fore a cycle of conversion and back-conversion is com-
plete. (We assume that the eﬀect of the diﬀerence be-
tween the group-velocity dispersions (GVD) of the FF
and the SH is negligible; in practice, it typically is much
weaker than the inter-pulse GVM. This will be discussed
quantitatively below.) Thus, after one cycle of conversion
and back-conversion, the intensity proﬁle of the SH ﬁeld
is retarded or advanced with respect to that of the FF,
depending on the sign of the GVM. The corresponding
delay of the nonlinear eﬀect is slightly smaller or larger
than one full conversion cycle. As a result, an eﬀectively
advanced or retarded phase shift is accumulated by the
FF. The corresponding eﬀect in the spectral domain is
a frequency shift toward the blue or the red. Such fre-
quency shifts have been predicted through numerical cal-
culations4,7.

Dashed (solid) lines are for the case of zero (nonzero)

The propagation of the FF and the SH are governed

by coupled equations within the slowly varying envelope
approximation (SVEA)12. We neglect self- and cross-
phase modulation due to χ(3), consider only the tempo-
ral dimension, and assume conditions for type I second
harmonic generation, but the results can easily be gener-
alized.

Here a1 and a2 are the normalized FF and SH ﬁeld
amplitudes. Time is normalized to the initial pulse du-
ration, τ = t/τ0, and the scaled propagation coordi-
nate is ξ = z/LGVM. Here, δj = LGVM/LDS,j, where
2/GVD(ωj) are the dispersion lengths
LDS,j = 0.322τ0
with j = 1, 2. The parameter β = ∆kLGVM where
∆k = k2ω − 2kω is the normalized FF-SH wave-vector
mismatch.

Consider the simple but common case when only FF
light is incident on the quadratic medium. In the limit
of large phase-mismatch, conversion and back-conversion
occur rapidly and most of the energy resides in the FF
at all times. A relation between the FF and the SH
amplitudes can be derived as an expansion in powers of
β2. By eliminating a2 in Eq. 2 and keeping terms up to
order (1/β3), an equation of motion for the FF ﬁeld can
be derived:

a nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE), which is generalized
by the fourth and the ﬁfth terms that describe the
eﬀects of the GVM, and the mismatch of the GVD of
the FF and SH, respectively. The ﬁnal term is negligible
(at order 1/β2) since it is proportional to the square of
the ﬁrst derivative of the ﬁeld envelope (a small quantity
in the SVEA). In addition it is even in time for well
behaved ﬁelds (a1(t)), and hence cannot contribute to
the frequency shifting process. We neglect the GVD
mismatch since its eﬀect is much smaller than inter-pulse
GVM for typical nonlinear media under the assumed
conditions of small conversion to the SH. In that case,

We notice that Eq. 4 resembles the Chen-Liu-Lee equa-
tion (CLLE), which is integrable13. The diﬀerence is the
presence of a cubic nonlinear term. It can be shown that
Eq. 4 reduces to the CLLE:

where |c0|2 = β2pδ1/8, c1 = δ1β2/8, and c2 = β/2,

followed by the coordinate transformation

T = −p2/δ1 τ − βpδ1/2 ξ,

(7)

Z = ξ.

Hence, Eq. 4 is integrable as well. We note that the
CLLE is further related to the well-known, integrable
derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, via a Gauge-
invariant transformation14.

To further understand the eﬀects of the lowest order
correction from GVM in Eq. 4, we can compare it to
the equation governing the propagation of a single ﬁeld
envelope a1 under similar approximations to Eqs. 1-2, but

Here γ = n2ω0/(cπw2) for a Gaussian beam with of

we see that they are similar but with the Raman term of
Eq. 8 replaced by T eﬀ
R ≡ −2i/β.
While the correspondence is not exact since the func-
tional dependence is diﬀerent (∼ a1∂|a1|2/∂τ for Raman-
scattering vs. ∼ |a1|2∂a1/∂τ for the cascaded process),
some qualitative understanding can be gained from con-
sidering the eﬀective cascaded response with T eﬀ
R ∼ i/β:
ﬁrst, the cascaded correction is imaginary and hence does
not contribute directly to the phase (unlike the Raman
response). Rather it alters the ﬁeld envelope. The en-
velope change subsequently couples to the phase proﬁle
through the remaining terms of Eq. 4, so the frequency
shift occurs through a higher order process. Second, T eﬀ

saturates with 1/β ∼ 1/∆k(λ), unlike the Raman re-
sponse which does not depend strongly on wavelength.

This saturation will be explored in greater detail in Sec-
tion 3. Note that the eﬀective response for the cascaded
process can be >∼ two orders of magnitude greater than
that of Raman-scattering, so that signiﬁcant frequency
shifting is possible in cm of quadratic material (vs. me-
ters of ﬁber with Raman).

For a qualitative understanding of the eﬀect of the
GVM term, we decompose the ﬁeld a1(ξ, τ ) in Eq. 4 into
its amplitude and phase with the substitution a1(ξ, τ ) =
u(ξ, τ ) exp(iφ(ξ, τ )), where u(ξ, τ ) and φ(ξ, τ ) are real
functions. The evolution of the amplitude and the phase
is then given by

The ﬁrst term on the right represents the Kerr-like

to the non-instantaneous nonlinear response due to large

The relation in Eq. 13 provides a valid description of
the phase evolution only in its early stages, before the
ﬁeld amplitude is modiﬁed signiﬁcantly, and in the ab-
sence of dispersion. Within these approximations, the

eﬀect of the GVM on the nonlinear phase shift can be

which has a bipolar shape. Positive frequency compo-
nents are attenuated and negative frequencies are ampli-
ﬁed, or vice versa, depending on the sign of the phase-
mismatch to GVM ratio. This result is expected to hold
in general for any smooth, single-peaked pulse shape for
which a1(0, τ ) → 0 for |τ | → ∞. Such a frequency shift
is expected from the GVM term, which has an odd-order
time derivative.

3. Numerical Analysis

Although the approximate one-ﬁeld equation (Eq. 4) is
useful for a qualitative understanding, it is necessary to
consider the coupled equations (Eqs. 1-2) for a quanti-
tative description. To this end, we numerically solve a
version of Eqs. 1-2 that has been generalized to include
self- and cross-phase modulation terms due to the cubic
nonlinearity. We use a diﬀerent ﬁeld normalization here
to facilitate comparison to experimental parameters.

Here the FF and SH envelopes (A1 and A2, respec-
tively) are in units of the initial peak FF ﬁeld A0 (related
to the initial peak FF intensity by I0 = pε/µ|A0|2/2)
and n2 is the Kerr nonlinear index. The cubic nonlinear
length characterizing the pulse propagation is LN L,j =
c/ωjn2I0 (the length over which the accumulated nonlin-
ear phase shift is 1) for frequency ωj with j = 1, 2. The
propagation coordinate z is normalized to the quadratic
nonlinear length ZI = nλ1/2πdeﬀA0 which characterizes
the strength of the nonlinear coupling. deﬀ is the eﬀec-
tive quadratic nonlinear coeﬃcient. Time τ , LDS,j, and
LGVM are deﬁned as for Eqs. 1-2.

Eqs. 16-17 are solved using a symmetric split-step
beam propagation method16. The simulations assume
typical conditions for femtosecond pulses in quadratic
nonlinear crystals. As an example, we calculate the
propagation of 120-fs pulses with a peak intensity of
50 GW/cm2 in a 10 cm-long quadratic medium. The
launched pulse shape is chosen to be Gaussian and the
center wavelength is 790 nm. The quadratic medium used
is barium metaborate (Ba2BO4 or BBO), for which the
material parameters are: n = 1.63, deﬀ = 1.82 pm/V,
n2 = 3.2 × 10−16 cm2/W, GVM = -186 fs/mm, the
FF (SH) GVD = 70 (190) fs2/mm, and the FF (SH)
third-order dispersion is 50 (81) fs3/mm. Note that the
true cubic nonlinearity (n2) is included in the calcula-
tions. Two-photon absorption is neglected since it is
small for BBO at 790 nm. The phase-mismatch is set
to be ∆k = 5π/mm, corresponding to a self-defocusing
nonlinearity and a magnitude that is about half the min-
imum value to obtain a Kerr-like phase shift. This par-
ticular set of conditions, except for the crystal length, is
chosen to correspond to experiments that are described
later in the text. As expected, the spectrum of the pulse
shifts to higher frequencies as it propagates through the
quadratic medium. The evolution of the spectrum is
shown in Fig. 2(a). Initially, the frequency-shift increases
linearly with propagation distance, but eventually the
process saturates (Fig. 2(b)). The spectrum of the SH
ﬁeld shifts opposite from the FF (i.e. to lower frequen-
cies), prior to saturation. This saturation is expected,
since the eﬀective response of the cascaded process de-
creases (or is distorted) with increases frequency shift.
For this choice of pulse parameters and phase-mismatch,
the saturation begins beyond 3 cm, which is close to the
maximum length of available BBO crystals. The cubic
electronic nonlinearity of the quadratic material is in-
cluded here for complete correspondence with experimen-
tal parameters, however the close agreement in Fig. 2(b)
between the saturation trend with and without n2 in-
dicates the dominance of the quadratic process in the
frequency shifting dynamics. In Fig 2(b), the presence
of cubic nonlinearity slightly reduces the resulting fre-
quency shift, as expected due to its self-focusing phase.
One might expect the material’s Raman response to be
relevant to the frequency shifting dynamics studied here,
however the Raman response of BBO with ∼100-fs pulses
is small compared to the cascaded response. In compari-

5

 

son to Raman, the cubic electronic nonlinearity included
above in Fig. 2(b) is a larger eﬀect, even though it al-
ters the frequency shifting process indirectly through the
nonlinear phase.

The pulse propagation is dominated by an interplay
of GVD and the eﬀective nonlinearity from the cascaded
process in the form of soliton-like dynamics. In the time
domain, the pulse undergoes compression since the en-
ergy is more than the amount needed to balance the dis-
persive eﬀects. The intensity proﬁles before the onset of
saturation and at the exit face of the crystal are plotted in
Fig. 3 along with those of the launched pulse. The FF un-
dergoes a steady compression accompanied by energy loss
to the SH: At z = 12 mm, its FWHM is 110 fs with 64%
of the pulse energy remaining in the FF. With propaga-
tion, the pulse shape becomes slightly asymmetrical. The
asymmetrical structure develops into a secondary pulse
in the ﬁnal stages of the propagation, which corresponds
to the secondary structure of the spectrum (Fig. 2(a)).
At z = 100 mm, the FWHM of the main peak is reduced
to 40 fs while ∼ 36% of the launched energy is retained
in the FF. The temporal proﬁles are displaced since the
pulse experiences diﬀerent group velocities as its central
frequency changes.

A similar picture emerges for the total

frequency
shift for ﬁxed propagation distance and varying phase-
mismatch. The magnitude of the nonlinear phase, and
hence the frequency shift, is proportional to 1/∆k be-
fore it saturates. Loss to SH conversion increases with
decreasing |∆k|, so there exists a trade-oﬀ between the
magnitude of the frequency shift and loss. We deﬁne a
ﬁgure-of-merit (FOM) for the shifting process as the ra-

tio of frequency-shift to energy content in the SH ﬁeld,
which attains a maximum for phase-mismatch values
slightly below that of the minimum for obtaining Kerr-
like nonlinear phase shifts (Fig. 4). This is demonstrated
in Fig. 4, which shows simulations of 100-fs, 200-pJ
pulses with center wavelength 1550 nm (and peak in-
tensity ∼ 5 GW/cm2). The material parameters used
correspond to the quadratic material periodically-poled
lithium niobate (PPLN): n = 2.14, deﬀ = 16.5 pm/V,
n2 = 3.2 × 10−15 cm2/W, GVM = -370 fs/mm, and
the FF (SH) GVD = 100 (400) fs2/mm. Under these
conditions, the stationary boundary for Kerr-like phase
shifts corresponds to |∆k| >∼ 25π/mm. Notice that much
larger frequency shifts can be generated closer to phase-
matching, but with larger SH-conversion.

the

The non-instantaneous nature

cascaded
quadratic process with signiﬁcant walk-oﬀ between the
FF and the SH is demonstrated by the nonlinear phase
shift imposed on the FF. Simulations conﬁrm the afore-
mentioned expectations: Eﬀectively retarded or ad-
vanced phase shifts are imposed on the FF depending
on the sign of the GVM (Fig. 5).

4. Experimental Observation of the Frequency-
shift

Experiments were performed with 120-fs, 0.6-mJ pulses,
centered at 790 nm, generated by a Ti:sapphire regener-
ative ampliﬁer. The launched pulse shape was approxi-
mately Gaussian with a clean spatial proﬁle and the peak
intensity is estimated to be 50 GW/cm2. A 17 mm-
long piece of BBO served as the quadratic medium. The
GVM length is LGVM = 0.38 mm, for which the crite-

temporal proﬁle of the pulse did not change signiﬁcantly
in these experiments. The experimental results are com-
pared to the results of numerical simulations which con-
tained no free parameters and were based on experimen-
tal conditions. In Fig. 6, the calculated spectrum of the
unshifted pulse (36π/mm) is normalized so that it con-
tains the same power as the measured unshifted spectrum
and all other traces have the same relative scaling, so that
the units of all the given spectra are the same. With this
in mind, there is excellent agreement between the mea-
sured spectra and the simulations. In particular, the shift
increases greatly from ∆k = 19π/mm to ∆k = 5π/mm.
The latter is the phase-mismatch for which the ratio of
the spectral-shift to SH conversion should peak. The de-
pendence of the frequency-shift on the phase-mismatch,
as summarized by the inset of Fig. 6, agrees qualitatively
with the results of Fig. 4; however, the phase-mismatch
corresponding to maximum spectral-shift to SH conver-
sion is diﬀerent than in Fig. 4 as a consequence of diﬀer-
ent physical parameters in the experiment.

However, red-shifts occur with self-focusing nonlinearity,
which limits the peak intensity available without contin-
uum generation and crystal damage. Consequently we
focus here on blue-shifts.

Increasing frequency-shift of the FF was observed with
decreasing phase-mismatch (Fig. 6). The inset of Fig. 6
shows the spectral shift versus phase-mismatch for self-
defocussing phase shifts, and the main ﬁgure shows exam-
ple spectra. The data presented for ∆k = 36π/mm serve
as a control experiment: At such a large phase mismatch
the cascade nonlinear phase and the Kerr nonlinearity
are negligible and the spectrum is indistinguishable from
the spectrum of the launched pulses (not shown). The

5. Applications

We have shown that cascaded quadratic processes
under phase-mismatched conditions and in the pres-
ence of
signiﬁcant GVM (typical conditions with
femtosecond-duration pulses) result in an eﬀectively non-
instantaneous cubic nonlinearity. The response time
is controllable by appropriate choice of the phase-
mismatch. In addition to providing an intuitive picture
for the eﬀect of phase-mismatch on the propagation of
femtosecond pulses, this nonlinear process oﬀers some
unique features. The nonlocal nature of the Raman-like
cascade nonlinearity is interesting in its own right. Non-
locality of the cubic nonlinearity has been shown to ar-

rest self-focusing collapse and to stabilize solitons, for
example17,18. The nonlocal nature of the cascade pro-
cess under non-stationary conditions can be controlled
or tailored to speciﬁc situations via the phase-mismatch.
Many applications of a controllable eﬀective Raman
process can be envisioned. Perhaps the most obvious one
is the cancellation of the Raman shift that a short pulse
accumulates as it propagates in optical ﬁber. For exam-
ple, in telecommunication systems with bit rates above
∼ 20 Gbit/s, the pulse duration is short enough that
timing jitter is dominated by jitter arising from Raman-
induced frequency shifts19.

In high-energy short-pulse ﬁber ampliﬁers, the nonlin-
ear phase shift can be controlled reasonably well by the
technique of chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation, and as a result
an equally important limitation to pulse energy is stim-
ulated Raman scattering20. The red-shifts produced by
Raman scattering can be compensated by blue-shifting
the pulses prior to, or following, propagation in ﬁber.
As an example, we calculate the pre-compensation of the
Raman-induced red-shift of a 100-fs, transform-limited
pulse centered at 1550 nm in standard single-mode ﬁber
(modal area of 80 µm2 and GVD of −23 ps2/km). The
pulse energy is 1 nJ. The quadratic medium is a 4 cm-
long wave-guide written in PPLN. The modal area of
the waveguide is 40 µm2 and the GVD for the FF is
100 ps2/km21. The phase-mismatch is set to ∆k =
20π/mm. The pulse is ﬁrst blue-shifted in the PPLN
waveguide and then propagates in the ﬁber. These cal-
culations indicate that the central wavelength can be kept
at 1550 nm, following propagation in up to 50 cm of ﬁber.
If no pre-compensation is utilized, the pulse is red-shifted
to 1800 nm (Fig. 7). This result nicely complements the
previously-established conclusion that the cascade non-
linearity can be used to compensate the nonlinear phase
shift produced by the electronic Kerr nonlinearity under
similar conditions22.

Other potential applications include devices that con-
vert peak power to frequency-shift, which can be used to
switch wavelength channels or intensity discrimination
with the addition of a frequency ﬁlter23.

We consider the application to pulse compression in
some detail. For pulse energies in excess of 1 mJ, meth-
ods based on cubic nonlinearity for the generation of
extra bandwidth cannot be used, owing to the limita-
tions of excessive nonlinearity in single-mode waveguides
and material damage through self-focusing for unguided
geometries. Self-defocussing nonlinearities in quadratic
media address these diﬃculties5,24. The generalization
of this approach to include frequency shifts as described
here enables us to implement an analog of Raman-soliton
compression25: high-order solitons are formed, producing
a compressed primary pulse that undergoes a continuous
self-frequency shift. An advantage of this approach is
that the pedestal commonly produced by Raman-soliton
compression consists mainly of unshifted frequency com-
ponents. These components can be eliminated with a
frequency ﬁlter to yield a pedestal-free pulse.

poral proﬁle/spectrum.

Numerical simulations for realistic parameters demon-
strate the utility of this approach: 100-fs, 0.6-nJ pulses
with ∆k = 50π/mm compress to 20-fs upon propaga-
tion through a 6 cm-long waveguide in PPLN (Fig. 8).
The pulse quality (Qc), deﬁned as the ratio of energy
contained within the FWHM of the pulse to that of the
initial pulse, is calculated to be 0.65. The unshifted com-
ponents can be ﬁltered out to produce a longer (38 fs)
but much cleaner (Qc = 0.91) pulse. Compression in a
second 2.5-cm-long PPLN crystal generates a 15 fs pulse
with virtually no additional degradation in pulse qual-
ity (Qc = 0.90). The resulting pulse after two stages of
compression contains ∼50% of the launched pulse energy.
Similarly, calculations indicate that compression factors

of up to 3 should be attainable with 1 mJ pulses and us-
ing a bulk BBO crystal at 800 nm, and experiments are
underway to verify this compression. In addition to the
high pulse quality, a practical advantage of this approach
is that larger nonlinear phase shifts can be produced at
the smaller phase mismatches needed in comparison to
compression in quadratic media under nearly-stationary
conditions.

6. Conclusion

In summary we have demonstrated a new capability of
cascaded quadratic processes under phase-mismatched
conditions: Eﬀectively retarded or advanced nonlinear
phase shifts can be impressed on a pulse in the presence
of signiﬁcant GVM between the FF and SH frequen-
cies. The frequency-domain manifestation of this non-
instantaneous nonlinear response is red- or blue-shifts of
the pulse spectrum. The direction and the magnitude
of the frequency-shift is controllable by the choice of the
phase-mismatch. Just as eﬀectively instantaneous phase
shifts from cascaded processes are analogous to bounded
electronic (χ(3)) nonlinearities for negligible GVM, these
non-instantaneous phase shifts in the presence of strong
GVM are analogous to nuclear (Raman-induced) nonlin-
earities.

We expect the unique features of these processes to
ﬁnd many applications. Here, we numerically demon-
strated compensation of Raman-induced frequency-shifts
and high-quality pulse compression assuming typical con-
ditions for femtosecond pulses in common quadratic non-
linear media. More generally, however, spectral shifts
from cascaded quadratic processes should be applica-
ble to all processes involving Raman-induced frequency-
shifts, but with the added freedom of sign and magnitude
control.

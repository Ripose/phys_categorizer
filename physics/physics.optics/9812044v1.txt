Wave channeling of X-rays in narrow rough capillaries -
non Andronov-Leontovich theory.

L.I.Ognev1

Abstract

The eﬀect of capture of X-ray beam into narrow submicron capillary was inves-
tigated with account for diﬀraction and decay of coherency by roughness scattering
in transitional boundary layer. In contrast to well-known Andronov-Leontovich ap-
proach the losses do not vanish at zero gliding angle and scale proporpional to the
ﬁrst power of roughness amplitude for small gliding angles. It was shown that for
small correlation radius of roughness the scattering decay of coherency can be made
of the same order as absorption decay of lower channeling modes to produce angu-
lar collimation of X-ray beams. Estimates were given for optimum capillary length
at diﬀerent roughness amplitudes for angular sensitivity of X-ray transmission and
chenneling eﬀects that can be useful for designing of detector systems.

Capture of X-ray beam into a narrow dielectric capillary reviels many
features of mode behavior typical for cannelling of relativistic positrons in
crystals [1, 2]. X-ray scattring at rough surfaces is usually investigated within
the well known Andronov-Leontovich approach [3]. A model with transitional
layer was proposed in [4]. Within both the models scattering and absorption
disappear at small grazing angle limit that appearently results from assump-
tion of plane wave incidence that is not true for submicron capillaries. The
evolution of the chenneled X-ray beam can be calculated either by direct
integration of the wave equation [5] or on the basis of the mode approach. In
the latter case the account for strong incoherent scattering is serious problem.
It was shown that at small correlation lengths of roughness absorption
can be prevailing eﬀect. Estimates are given for optimum capillary length at
diﬀerent roughness amplitudes for angular sensitivity of X-ray transmission
and channeling eﬀects that can be useful in designing of detector systems.

A new approach was developed for description of propagation of X-ray
beam in thin dielectric capillary with rough absorbing walls on the basis of
slowly varying scalar amplitudes of electrical ﬁeld vector A(x, y, z). In this
case large angle scattering is neglected so

∂2 < A(x, y, z) > /∂z2 ≪ k · ∂ < A(x, y, z) > /∂z

and because the beam is narrow

∂2 < A(x, y, z) > /∂z2 ≪ ∂2 < A(x, y, z) > /∂x2,

where z and x are coordinates along and across the channel. The assumption
results in ”parabolic equation” of quazioptics.

In the approach the statistical method of Tatarsky (see [6]) was gener-
alised to include stratiﬁed media similar to the case of electron channeling
in single crystals [7]. The dielectric permitance on the rough boundary with
the random shape x = ξ(z) was presented as

ε(x, z) = ε1 + (ε0 − ε1)H(x − ξ(z))

where ε1 and ε0 is the dielectric permittance of the substance and of the
air respectively, H(x) is a step function. So the dielectric permittance of the
transitional layer is the function of the perpendicular to boundary coordinate
x can be written

< ε(x) >= ε1 + (ε0 − ε1) Z

where P (ξ) is the propability distribution of roughness heights which is as-
sumed to be normal.

The coherent part of the amplitude A(x, y, z) can be calculated from the

statistically averaged equation (angular brackets correspond to averaging)

2ik∂ < A(x, y, z) > /∂z − ∆⊥ < A(x, y, z) > −

− k2χ(x, y) < A(x, y, z) > −ik2W (x, y) < A(x, y, z) >= 0,

where

A(x, y, z = 0) = A0(x, y),

χ(x, y) = (< ε(x, y) > −ε1)/ε1.

Roughness is accounted for as scattering potential W (x, y) and can be com-
pared with real absorption Im(χ(x, y)) at various parameters of the capillary.
The value of incoherent absorption term at the boundary can be written as

where R(z) is the autocorrelation coeﬃcient, σ is dispersion of ξ(z) distribu-
tion. It can be shown that the value W (x) in the middle of the transitional
layer (x = 0) does not depend on σ and is nearly proportional to the corre-
lation length lcorr of roughness.

Scattering potential W (x) and normalized dielectric permittance χ(x)
across a ﬂat glass channel were calculated for X-ray energy E = 10keV ,
σ = 100˚A and correlation length of roughness lcorr = 2µm.
Normalized dielectric permittance Re(χ(x, y)) and scattering potential W (x)
curves are shown on Fig. 1 in arbitrary units.

where eigenfunctions are solutions of equations

ing βscatter (dashed line) and absorption βabsorp (solid line) on the

As it is seen from the Figure 2 the eﬀect of incoherent scattering for given
correlation length is an order of magnitude higher than of real absorption.
Coherent eﬀects for the mode number ”1” and higher will decay after several
cm length of the capillary. And decreasing of correlation length will result

5

in nearly proportional decreasing of incoherent scattering.The eﬀect can be
measured by the loss of angular dependence of outgoing beam on input beam
orientation for various quality surfaces.

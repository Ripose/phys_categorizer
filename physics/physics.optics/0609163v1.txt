(Dated: August 9, 2013)

In analogy to a perturbed harmonic oscillator, we calculate the fundamental and some other
higher order soliton solutions of the nonlocal nonlinear Sch¨odinger equation (NNLSE) in the 2nd
approximation in the generally nonlocal case. Comparing with numerical simulations we show that
soliton solutions in the 2nd approximation can describe the generally nonlocal soliton states of the
NNLSE more exactly than that in the 0th approximation. We show that for the nonlocal case
of an exponential-decay type nonlocal response the Gaussian-function-like soliton solutions can’t
describe the nonlocal soliton states exactly even in the strongly nonlocal case. The properties of
such nonlocal solitons are investigated. In the strongly nonlocal limit, the soliton’s power and phase
constant are both in inverse proportion to the 4th power of its beam width for the nonlocal case of
a Gaussian function type nonlocal response, and are both in inverse proportion to the 3th power of
its beam width for the nonlocal case of an exponential-decay type nonlocal response.

INTRODUCTION

Since Snyder and Mitchell’s pioneering work[1], spa-
tial solitons propagating in nonlocal nonlinear media
have been investigated experimentally and theoreti-
cally in a variety of conﬁgurations and material sys-
tems.
It is theoretically indicated that stable spa-
tial bright (dark) soliton states can be admitted in
self-focus(self-defocus) weekly nonlocal media[2] and
Gaussian-function-like bright soliton states can be admit-
ted in self-focus strongly nonlocal media[1, 3]. It has been
shown theoretically that nonlocality drastically modiﬁes
the interaction of dark solitons by inducing a long-range
attraction between them, thereby permitting the forma-
tion of stable dark soliton bound states[4]. The propaga-
tion properties of light beams in the presence of losses in
the strongly nonlocal case are diﬀerent from that in the
local case[5]. By considering the special case of a loga-
rithmic type of nonlinearity and a Gaussian function type
nonlocal response, the dynamics of beams in partially
nonlocal media[6] and the propagation of incoherent op-
tical beams[7] are analytically studied. By using the vari-
ational principle, the propagation properties of a solitary
wave in nonlinear nonlocal medium with a power function
type nonlocal response are studied[8]. The modulational
instability of plane waves in nonlocal Kerr media[9, 10]
and the stabilizing eﬀect of nonlocality[11] have been
studied. The analogy between parametric interaction in
quadratic media and nonlocal Kerr-type nonlinearities
can provide a physically intuitive theory for quadratic
solitons[12]. Some properties of the strongly nonlocal
solitons (SNSs) and their interaction are greatly diﬀer-
ent from that in the local case, e. g. two coherent SNSs
with π phase diﬀerence attract rather than repel each
other[1], the phase shift of the SNS can be very large

comparing with the local soliton with the same beam
width[3], and the phase shift of a probe beam can be
modulated by a pump beam in the strongly nonlocal
case[13]. Employing a Gaussian ansatz and using a vari-
ational approach, the evolution of a Gaussian beam in
the sub-strongly nonlocal case is studied[14]. Recently
it is experimentally shows that solitons in the nematic
liquid crystal(NLC) are SNSs[15, 18]. The team of As-
santo has developed a general theory of spatial solitons
in the NLC that exhibiting a nonlinearity with an arbi-
trary degree of an eﬀective nonlocality and established
an important link between the SNS and the parametric
soliton[15, 16, 17, 18]. They also experimentally inves-
tigated the role of the nonlocality in transverse modu-
lational instability(MI) in the NLC[16, 17] and observed
the optical multisoliton generation following the onset of
spatial MI[19]. The interaction of SNSs has been ex-
perimentally demonstrated[20, 21], and the possibility of
all-optical switching and logic gating with SNSs in the
NLC has been discussed[22].

However the theoretical studies on the spatial nonlo-
cal soliton are mostly focused on the strongly nonlocal
case[1, 3, 5, 13, 15, 18] and the weekly nonlocal case[2].
There is a lack of studies on the moderate nonlocal case.
On the other hand, even though a convenient method
has been introduced in references [3, 5, 13, 14] to study
the propagation of light beams in the strongly nonlocal
case or even in the sub-strongly nonlocal case, to em-
ploy this method eﬃciently the nonlocal response func-
tion must be twice diﬀerentiable at its center. As will
be shown this method can’t deal with the nonlocal case
of an exponential-decay type nonlocal response function
that is not diﬀerentiable at its center.
In this paper,
in analogy to a perturbed harmonic oscillator, we calcu-
late the fundamental and some other higher order soli-
ton solutions of the NNLSE in the 2nd approximation in
the generally nonlocal case. Our method presented here
can deal with the nonlocal case of an exponential-decay
type nonlocal response function. Numerical simulations

conform that the soliton solution in the 2nd approxima-
tion can describe the generally nonlocal soliton states of
NNLSE more exactly than that in the 0th approximation.
It is shown that for the nonlocal case of an exponential-
decay type nonlocal response the Gaussian-function-like
soliton solutions can’t describe the fundamental soliton
states of the NNLSE exactly even in the strongly nonlo-
cal case, that is greatly diﬀerent from the case of a Gaus-
sian function type nonlocal response. The properties of
such nonlocal solitons are investigated. The functional
dependence of such nonlocal soliton’s power and phase
constant on its beam width is greatly diﬀerent from that
of the local soliton. Further more this functional de-
pendence for the nonlocal case of a Gaussian function
type nonlocal response greatly diﬀers from that of an
In particu-
exponential-decay type nonlocal response.
lar in the strongly nonlocal limit, the nonlocal soliton’s
power and phase constant are both in inverse proportion
to the 4th power of its beam width for the nonlocal case
of a Gaussian function type nonlocal response, and are
both in inverse proportion to the 3th power of its beam
width for the nonlocal case of an exponential-decay type
nonlocal response.

II. THE FUNDAMENTAL GENERALLY
NONLOCAL SOLITON SOLUTION IN THE 2ND
APPROXIMATION

Let’s consider the (1+1)-D dimensionless nonlocal non-
linear Sch¨odinger equation(NNLSE) [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12]

As indicated in reference [3], if R(x) is twice diﬀer-
entiable at x = 0 and the 2nd derivative R′′(0) < 0,
and if the characteristic nonlocal length is one order of
the magnitude larger than the beam width of the soli-
ton, the NNLSE (1) can be simpliﬁed to the following
strongly nonlocal model(SNM)

larger than the beam width, the SNM (3) can describe the
NNLSE (1) very well[3]. However, as will be shown, when
the characteristic nonlocal length and the beam width are
in the same order of the magnitude, the SNM (3) can’t
describe the NNLSE (1) very well. The SNM (3) can’t
deal with the generally nonlocal case. Further more, for
the exponential-decay type nonlocal response function
R(x) = 1/(2w0) exp(
/w0) which is not diﬀerentiable

at x = 0, we can’t get the parameter R′′0 of the SNM (3).
So the SNM (3) can’t deal with this nonlocal case of such
an exponential-decay type nonlocal response.

respectively.

In this paper, we deﬁne the degree of nonlocality by the
ratio of the characteristic nonlocal length to the beam
width of the light beam and use the phrase “generally
nonlocal case” to refer to the nonlocal case where the
degree of nonlocality is larger than one and less than
ten. For the Gaussian function type nonlocal response
function and the soliton solution (4), the degree of non-
locality is w0/ν. The larger of w0/ν, the stronger of the
nonlocality. In fact for a given type of nonlocal response,
soliton solutions with the same degree of nonlocality can
be described in the same way. That can be clariﬁed by
taking transformations[23]

¯x =

x
κ

¯z =

z
κ2

¯u = κu

¯R = κR .

(8)

Under these transformations, the form of NNLSE (1)
keeps invariant and the degree of nonlocality keeps in-
variant too. If we set κ equal to the characteristic nonlo-
cal length of R(x), the characteristic nonlocal length of
¯R(¯x) will be scaled to unity and the degree of nonlocal-
ity will be determined only by the beam width of ¯u(¯x, ¯z).
In this case the less of the beam width of ¯u(¯x, ¯z), the
stronger of the nonlocality. On the other hand we may
also set κ equal to the beam width of u(x, z). If we do
this, the degree of nonlocality will be determined only by
the characteristic nonlocal length of ¯R(¯x). The larger of
the characteristic nonlocal length of ¯R(¯x), the stronger

of the nonlocality. In this paper, the characteristic non-
local length of R(x) and the beam width of u(x, z) are
not scaled to unity.

As will be shown, in the generally nonlocal case and the
strongly nonlocal case the parameter µ can be viewed
as the beam width of the soliton, and when x < µ, the
terms αx4 and βx6 are one and two order of the magni-
tude smaller than the term x2/(2µ4) respectively. That
indicates the eﬀects of αx4 and βx6 on the soliton are
considerably small comparing with the eﬀect of x2/(2µ4)
in the generally nonlocal case. Further more in the gen-
erally nonlocal case, the eﬀects of the x8 power term
and the other higher power terms of the Taylor’s series
of V (x) on the soliton are far smaller than the eﬀects
of these three lower power terms. For convenience sake
we will neglect such higher power terms in the following
discussions and simply adopt

Eq. (16) takes the form of the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation, the parameters µ, α, β are depended on the soli-
ton solution ψn(x).

If α = 0 and β = 0, equation (16) reduces to the
well-known stationary Schr¨odinger equation for a har-
monic oscillator. Since in the generally nonlocal case the
eﬀects of the terms αx4 and βx6 on the soliton are far
smaller than that of the term x4/(2µ4), we view the terms
αx4 and βx6 as perturbations in the process of solving
Eq. (16). Following the perturbation method presented
in any a text book about quantum mechanics(for exam-
ple, seeing [24]), we get for the fundamental soliton solu-
tion in the 2nd approximation

However, as the degree of nonlocality decreases the eﬀects
of αx4, βx6 and other higher power terms become larger
and larger, and when the characteristic nonlocal length
is comparable with or less than the beam width of the
soliton, the x8 power term and other higher power terms
are no longer negligible. For such cases we must take the
higher power terms of the Taylor’s series of V (x) into
account.

mulas to calculate the perturbed fundamental generally

This soliton solution can describe the soliton state of the

In the generally nonlocal case, the fundamental soli-
ton solution in the 2nd approximation is described by
ψ0(A, α, β, x) in Eq. (17). As shown in Fig. (1) when
w0 = 2, µ = 1 and A = 3.22, α =
0.0487, β =
0.00317 numerically calculated by the ﬁxed-point method
presented in the section Appendix (A), the diﬀerence
between the fundamental soliton solution in the 2nd
approximation ψ0(A, α, β, x) and that in the 0th ap-
proximation ψ0(A, 0, 0, x) is comparatively small. As a
Gaussian function, the power and the beam width of
ψ0(A, 0, 0, x) are given by A2 and µ respectively. There-
fore the power and the beam width of ψ0(A, α, β, x) are
approximatively given by A2 and µ respectively too. So
in the generally nonlocal case we can approximately de-
termine the degree of nonlocality by w0/µ, and approxi-
mately obtain

Using the NNLSE (1) as the evolution equation
and using the numerical simulation method we investi-
gate the propagation of light beams in nonlocal media
with a Gaussian function type nonlocal response. The
numerical simulation method is the split-step Fourier
Method(SSFM)[25], the step-size ∆z = 0.01, transver-
sal sampling range
10 and the sampling
interval ∆x = 0.1. With diﬀerent input amplitude en-
velops (the initial data of numerical simulations) that
are described by u0(x, 0) in Eq. (22), ψ0(A, 0, 0, x) and
ψ0(A, α, β, x) respectively, we show the propagations of
these light beams in Fig. (2). It is indicated that in the
generally nonlocal case when the degree of nonlocality
w0/µ = 2, ψ0(A, α, β, x) can describe the soliton state
of the NNLSE (1) more exactly than ψ0(A, 0, 0, x) and
u0(x, 0) in Eq. (22). The soliton solution in the 2nd ap-
proximation ψ0(A, α, β, x) also can describe the soliton
state of the NNLSE (1) exactly when w0/µ = 1, that is
shown in Fig. (3). However when w0/µ = 0.5, as indi-
cated in Fig. (4), ψ0(A, α, β, x) can’t describe the soliton
state of the NNLSE (1) exactly. In such a case, we must
take the higher power terms of the Taylor’s series of V (x)
into account and calculate the higher order approxima-
tion. To show how exactly ψ0(A, α, β, x) describe the
fundamental soliton state, we deﬁne

That means for a given value of characteristic nonlocal
length in the strongly nonlocal case the power and the
phase constant of the nonlocal soliton are both in inverse
proportion to the 4th power of its beam width. The
dependence of the power P and the phase constant γ
on the beam width µ are shown in Fig. (5) for a given
value of characteristic nonlocal length.
It is indicated
that Eq. (27) and Eq. (30) can describe these dependence
exactly in the generally nonlocal case.

It is found that several nonlocal media, for example the
nematic liquid crystal[15, 18], their light-induced per-
turbed refractive index can be described by Eq. (35). If
the size of the nonlocal media is much larger than the
beam width of the soliton and the characteristic nonlo-
cal length, the eﬀect of the boundary condition on the
soliton can be negligible and we can simply assume the
size of the nonlocal media is inﬁnity large. For such a

It is worth to note that in the strongly nonlocal case the
parameters α and β are free from the characteristic non-
local length w0. Even when the characteristic nonlocal
length w0 approaches inﬁnity, the parameters α, β still
rest on ﬁnite values and don’t approach zero, and there-
fore ψ0(A, α, β, x) does’t approach ψ0(A, 0, 0, x). That
greatly diﬀers from the nonlocal case of a Gaussian func-
tion type nonlocal response. As a result the Gaussian-
function-like soliton solution ψ0(A, 0, 0, x) can’t describe
the soliton state of the NNLSE (1) exactly even in the

strongly nonlocal case, that is shown in Fig. (6). As
shown in Fig. (7), ψ0(A, α, β, x) also can describe the soli-
ton state of the NNLSE (1) exactly when w0/µ = 1. Even
when w0/µ = 0.5, as indicated in Fig. (8), ψ0(A, α, β, x)
can describe the soliton state of the NNLSE (1) in high
quality. As indicated by the values of ¯θ in table (I),
ψ0(A, α, β, x) can describe the fundamental soliton states
of NNLSE (1) exactly in the generally nonlocal case.

In the strongly nonlocal case the soliton’s power and

phase constant are approximately given by

respectively. For a given value of the characteristic non-
local length, the soliton’s power and phase constant are
both in inverse proportion to the 3th power of its beam
width in the strongly nonlocal case that diﬀers from the
nonlocal case of a Gaussian function type nonlocal re-
sponse where the soliton’s power and phase constant are
both in inverse proportion to the 4th power of its beam
width in the strongly nonlocal case. The dependence of
the soliton’s power P and phase constant γ on its beam
width µ are shown in Fig. (9) for a given value of char-
acteristic nonlocal length. It is indicated that Eq. (42)
and Eq. (43) can describe these dependence very well in
the strongly nonlocal case.

7.606, α =

w0/(√3µ) = 1.5.

−

As the degree of nonlocality w0/(√3µ) approaches in-
ﬁnity, the parameters α and β approach zero, and
ψ1(A, α, β, x) approaches ψ1(A, 0, 0, x). Therefore in the
strongly nonlocal case an Hermite-Gaussian-function-like
second order soliton solution is obtained, and the power
and the phase constant of ψ1(A, α, β, x) are both in in-
verse proportion to the 4th power of its beam width. As
indicated in Fig. (11) and Fig. (12), the second order soli-
ton solution in the 2nd perturbation ψ1(A, α, β, x) can
describe the second order soliton state of the NNLSE (1)
exactly when w0/(√3µ) = 1.5 and describe it in high
qulity when w0/(√3µ) = 1. As shown by the values of

¯θ in table (I),ψ1(A, α, β, x) can exactly describe the sec-
ond order nonlocal soltion state in the generally nonlocal
cases.

Finally since the all eigenfunctions of the harmonic os-
cillator can be found systematically[24], it is possible that
in analogy to a perturbed harmonic oscillator we can also
approximately calculate the third order soliton solution
or the fourth order soliton solution and so on in the gener-
ally nonlocal case for the Gaussian function type nonlocal
response.

ψ1(A, α, β, x) in the nonlocal case of the Gaussian func-
tion type nonlocal response and to ψ0(A, α, β, x) in the
nonlocal case of the exponential-decay type nonlocal re-
sponse, we have V (2)(A, α, β, 0) > 0 for generally nonlo-
cal cases. If we deﬁne

case of the exponential-decay type nonlocal response, we

In such a case we can’t de-
ﬁne 1/µ4 = V (2)(A, α, β, 0) and can’t deﬁne the param-
eters µ, α, β as those in Eqs. (20). However as shown in
Figs. (13a) and (14a), we still can ﬁnd suitable values
of A, α, β for a ﬁxed value of µ to make V (A, α, β, x)
≈
˜V (x). These suitable values of A, α, β can be calculated
by solving the following coupling equations

V (A, α, β, x0) = V0 + 1

nonlocal case. Numerical simulations conﬁrm that the
soliton solutions in the 2nd perturbation can describe
the fundamental and second order soliton states of the
NNLSE (1) in high quality. For the nonlocal case of the
exponential-decay type nonlocal response, the Gaussian-
function-like soliton solution can’t describe the funda-
mental soliton state of the NNLSE (1) exactly even in
the strongly nonlocal case, that greatly diﬀers from the
nonlocal case of the Gaussian function type nonlocal re-
sponse. The functional dependence of the nonlocal soli-
ton’s power and phase constant on its beam width are
greatly diﬀerent from that of the local soliton.
In the
strongly nonlocal case, the soltion’s power and phase con-
stant are both in inverse proportion to the 4th power
of its beam width for the nonlocal case of the Gaussian
function type nonlocal response, and are both in inverse
proportion to the 3th power of its beam width for the
nonlocal case of the exponential-decay type nonlocal re-
sponse.

APPENDIX A: HOW TO CALCULATE THE
PARAMETERS A, α, β WITH EQUATIONS. (20)

In principle, V (A, α, β, x) and the parameters A, α, β
can be found by solving Eq. (19) and Eqs. (20) di-
rectly, but these tasks are considerably involved. Here we
present a ﬁxed-point method to calculate these parame-
ters A, α, β for a ﬁxed value of µ. Firstly corresponding
to V (A, α, β, x) in Eq. (19), we deﬁne

U (α, β, x) =

V (A, α, β, x)
A2

.

(A1)

For an arbitrary pair of initial values of α0, β0 with
suitable order of the magnitude, we can calculate
U (α0, β0, x). Let

A1 =

α1 = A2
β1 = A2

1U (6)(α0, β0, 0)/6!.

(A2)

(A3)
(A4)

For such a pair of values of α1, β1, we can ﬁnd an-
other U (α1, β1, x). Again we obtain another set of values
. Repeating these steps of calculations, we
A2, α2, β2}
{
A2, α3, β3}
can obtain series sets of values

and so on. The diﬀerence between
and

will approaches zero as the num-

{
ber of m approaches inﬁnity. To some accuracy, we can
calculate parameters A, α, β for a ﬁxed value of µ.

The durations and average speeds of ultrashort optical pulses transmitted through chiral sculptured thin ﬁlms (STFs) were calculated
using a ﬁnite–diﬀerence time–domain algorithm. Chiral STFs are a class of nanoengineered materials whose microstructure comprises
parallel helicoidal nanowires grown normal to a substrate. The nanowires are
1–10 µm in length. Durations
of transmitted pulses tend to increase with decreasing (free–space) wavelength of the carrier plane wave, while average speeds tend to
increase with increasing wavelength. An increase in nonlinearity, as manifested by an intensity–dependent refractive index in the frequency
domain, tends to increase durations of transmitted pulses and decrease average speeds. The circular Bragg phenomenon exhibited by
a chiral STFs manifests itself in the frequency domain as high reﬂectivity for normally incident carrier plane waves whose circular
polarization state is matched to the structural handedness of the ﬁlm and whose wavelength falls in a range known as the Bragg regime;
ﬁlms of the opposite structural handedness reﬂect such plane waves little. This eﬀect tends to distort the shapes of transmitted pulses
with respect to the incident pulses, and such shaping can cause sharp changes in some measures of average speed with respect to carrier
wavelength. A local maximum in the variation of one measure of the pulse duration with respect to wavelength is noted and attributed
to the circular Bragg phenomenon. Several of these eﬀects are explained via frequency–domain arguments. The presented results serve
as a foundation for future theoretical and experimental studies of optical pulse propagation through causal, nonlinear, nonhomogeneous,
and anisotropic materials.

1 Introduction

An ultrashort optical pulse is a pulse of light of duration less than
10 optical periods, where the optical
period is calculated from the dominant wavelength in the pulse spectrum. Such ultrashort pulses are
generated with commonly implemented mode–locked lasers, and several schemes for compressing and
amplifying them have been formulated [1]. Optical pulses are used for micromachining [2], lidar [3, 4], and
quantum control and probing of wavepackets and chemical reactions [5,6]; and their use has been suggested
for telecommunications [7].

∼

It is necessary to understand how ultrashort optical pulses propagate in materials in order to design
new materials and devices to manipulate them. Earlier, we reported on the spatiotemporal evolution of
ultrashort optical pulses as they propagate through complex nano–engineered materials called sculptured
thin ﬁlms (STFs). A STF is a unidirectionally nonhomogeneous, anisotropic medium whose morphology,
which consists of an array of parallel shaped nanowires, is engineered by design [8]. The morphology
of STFs may break certain translational and rotational symmetries, and these ﬁlms possess dispersive
dielectric and possibly dispersive magnetic properties in the optical regime.

The circular Bragg phenomenon is exhibited by chiral STFs due to their periodic nonhomogeneity and
structural chirality arising from the constituent nanowires being nanohelixes as shown in the electron
micrograph of Figure 1. As circularly polarized monochromatic light propagates through vacuum, the
electric ﬁeld traces out a helix. If the handedness of this helix matches that of the nanohelixes in a chiral
STF, and if the wavelength of the light lies within a range of wavelengths called the Bragg regime, the
light normally incident on the chiral STF is mostly reﬂected; if the handedness of the helix is opposite, the
reﬂection is little. In the time domain, the circular Bragg phenomenon is manifested as a pulse–bleeding
phenomenon [9, 10].

Previous research has shown that chiral STFs can aﬀect the shapes, durations, and energy content
of ultrashort optical pulses depending on the circular polarization state of the incident carrier plane

wave [10]. As the thickness of a chiral STF increases, the circular Bragg phenomenon ripens: the reﬂection
ﬁrst increases and then saturates, and diﬀerences in shape and duration between incident and transmitted
pulses arise [11]. Ultrawideband pulsed plane waves, known as videopulses, ultranarrowband rectangular
pulsed plane waves, and two–dimensional pulsed beams can therefore also be shaped by chiral STFs [12–14].
Pre– and post–resonance Bragg regimes have also been elucidated [15].

So far, all research into the shaping of pulsed plane waves and pulsed beams by chiral STFs has been of
a qualitative nature. The shapes of pulses reﬂected, refracted, transmitted, and diﬀracted by chiral STFs
were predicted numerically, but measures of the extent of pulse shaping were not introduced. Our purpose
here is to apply three measures of the pulse duration—the equivalent, root mean square, and correlation
durations—and three measures of the average speed of the pulse—the peak speed, the center–of–energy
speed, and the correlation speed—to the shaping of pulsed plane waves of diﬀerent total energies, carrier
wavelengths, and carrier polarization states after transmission through linear and nonlinear chiral STFs.
This work is important for four reasons. First, the measures of pulse shaping will allow direct comparisons
between our theoretical conclusions and future experiments. Second, quantiﬁcation of pulse shaping by
complex materials like STFs will facilitate the design of STFs to shape pulsed plane waves and pulsed
beams in controlled ways. Third, the algorithms we develop can be used to evaluate designs of STF–based
devices; and fourth, they advance the state of the art of the time–domain analysis of electromagnetic pulse
propagation to include propagation in causal, inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and nonlinear materials.

Parenthetically, by virtue of mathematical isomorphism we expect our results to hold, in general, for
cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) too. We note that others have modeled optical propagation in noncausal
nonlinear cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) in the frequency domain [16] and with the slowly–varying
envelope approximation [17]; propagation in linear CLCs has also been undertaken with the ﬁnite element
method [18]. Second harmonic generation in nonlinear chiral STFs was also studied previously in the
frequency domain [19]. Our work distinguishes itself from these earlier studies on account of its causal
time–domain treatment of the propagation of pulsed plane waves through nonlinear chiral STFs without
the invocation of the frequency domain or slowly varying envelope approximation.

Our report on the quantiﬁcation of the shaping of pulsed plane waves by chiral STFs proceeds as
follows. The constitutive relations of a chiral STF, along with a ﬁnite–diﬀerence scheme for calculating the
propagation of pulsed plane waves through vacuum and chiral STFs, are presented in Section 2. Measures
of the durations and average speeds of pulsed plane waves are also introduced in Section 2. We discuss
the main results of our work in Section 3, and present the main scientiﬁc and technological conclusions in
Section 4.

2.1 Maxwell curl postulates and constitutive relations

where E and B represent the primitive macroscopic electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively, while D and
H are the corresponding induction ﬁelds. The electromagnetic ﬁeld is a function of r, the position vector,
and t, the time. We employ a cartesian coordinate system deﬁned by the set of unit vectors
.
The time derivative is denoted by ∂t.

B (r, t) = µ0H (r, t) ,

where ǫ0 is the permittivity and µ0 is the permeability of vacuum. The polarization P is related to the

When pnl = 0, the ﬁlm exhibits a linear response to an applied ﬁeld. When pnl
= 0, the response is
third–order nonlinear; speciﬁcally, the material exhibits an intensity–dependent refractive index [19, 20].
The nonlinearity is thus isotropic. Whether linear or nonlinear, the chosen material does not respond
instantaneously to the applied ﬁeld.

The dielectric susceptibility dyadic χ

(r, t) contains the information about the nonhomogeneous,
anisotropic, and temporally nonlocal properties of a chiral STF. Suppose the chiral STF occupies the
[zL, zR],
region [zL, zR]. Then the dielectric susceptibility dyadic, which is null–valued in the region z /

Even though we treat pulsed plane waves in this paper, it should be noted that no electromagnetic
signal—or STF—can have an inﬁnite transverse extent; indeed, all physical electromagnetic signals are
pulsed beams. However, the pulsed–plane–wave approximation to a pulsed beam is appropriate when the
beamwidth is much larger than the carrier wavelength (but still smaller than the transverse extent of the
STF). The characteristics of two–dimensional pulsed beam propagation in chiral STFs have been reported
elsewhere [14].

2.4 Quantiﬁcation of pulse durations and average speeds

We now turn to quantitative measures of pulse duration and average speed. Our goal is to deﬁne measures
that are useful for experimental research or theoretical insight or both. As the chosen pulses are highly
broadband and suﬀer appreciable distortion, the usual concept of group velocity [25] is not meaningful for
analysis except in frequency–domain arguments. More sophisticated measures were therefore devised.

The pulse duration is an important parameter because it determines the time scale for measurements
or manipulations made with the pulse; pulses of shorter duration permit the measurement of events of
(m)
shorter duration [26]. In order to deﬁne measures of pulse duration, we considered the mth moment
f,ξ
of a scalar function f (ξ) with respect to variable ξ on the interval [ξa, ξb]:

We decided to use τp, τu, and τc as measures of pulse duration in this study.

There are many measures of the pulse speed, including the group speed and the centrovelocity [28]. We
calculated three measures of the speed of the pulse through the ﬁlm: the average speed of the pulse’s peak
value of U (zr, t), the average speed of ζU,t, and the average correlation velocity [29]. The energy density
U (zr, t) of the transmitted pulse was recorded over the interval [ta, tb] at some location zr > zR. Then the

Thus the speeds cp, cu, and cc are the thickness of the chiral STF divided by the computed times tp, tu,
and tc, less the time over which the pulse traverses the vacuous regions 0 < z < zL and zR < z < zr. We
note that these measures are average speeds because they are in the form of a ﬁnite distance over a ﬁnite
time interval, and hence do not reveal variations in the speed of the pulse as it enters, traverses, and exits
the chiral STF. For the foregoing calculations, we approximated integrals with the rectangular rule [30].
The measures of pulse duration and average speed have diﬀerent physical meanings and concomitant
advantages and disadvantages. The equivalent duration τp is the duration a rectangular pulse would have,
if it possessed the same peak value of U (zr, t) and the same total energy per unit area as the pulse
under consideration. Its advantage lies with its simplicity; however, it depends crucially on the correct
determination of the peak value of U (zr, t). This same problem is a disadvantage of cp, which is the
average speed of the peak of the pulse through the chiral STF. This measure of the speed can even become
multi–valued if the peak value of U (zr, t) occurs at more than one local maximum (like the twin humps
of a Bactrian camel).

The duration τu is the RMS deviation of U (zr, t) from its ﬁrst moment, normalized to the total energy
per unit area of the pulse. It is analogous to the concept of radius of gyration in mechanics. We call cu, the
average speed of ζU,t, the center–of–energy speed. It is analogous to the concept of the velocity of a body’s
center of mass in mechanics, and is closely related to the centrovelocity and a redeﬁnition of the group
velocity1, as discussed elsewhere [28]. The advantage of these measures is that they depend on U (zr, t)
over the whole pulse, and not just on the peak value of U (zr, t). However, it is possible for the center of
energy to be located at a value of z at which U (z, t) = 0 [29].

The correlation duration τc is a measure of how tightly U (zr, t) is concentrated in time. The correlation
velocity cc is the average speed of the peak of the correlation of the incident pulse with the transmitted
pulse. Like cp, it depends heavily on the shape of the transmitted pulse. In some cases, it could become a
multi–valued function of zr and the chosen time interval [ta, tb]. However, it does provide a way to track
the propagation of energy in the pulse in a diﬀerent way than cu, and it is fairly robust [29].

All six of the quantities we have deﬁned in this subsection are amenable to experimental determination,
for example by frequency–resolved optical gating (FROG) [26]. In our deﬁnitions of the measures, we

3 Results and discussion

We now turn to a discussion of the results of our calculations.

3.1 Constitutive and excitation parameters

The chiral STF we studied possesses the following constitutive parameters: p1 = 0.52, p2 = 0.42, p3 = 0.40,
N1,2,3 = 100, λ1 = 290 nm, λ2,3 = 280 nm, Ω = 200 nm, and α = 20◦. The ﬁlm is structurally right–
24 m2/V2),
handed, i.e., h = +1, and we chose it to be either linear (i.e., pnl = 0) or nonlinear (pnl = 3
in accord with simple order–of–magnitude estimates [31]. We ﬁxed zL = 30 µm and zR = 34 µm; thus, the
chiral STF is ten pitches thick. The variable z was discretized into intervals of ∆z = 2 nm, and the variable
3 fs. The center wavelength of the Bragg regime of the linear chiral STF
t into intervals of ∆t = 6.34
is approximately 516 nm, and its full–width half–maximum bandwidth is approximately 27 nm [10, 32],
though we note that both these quantities may change slightly when the chiral STF is nonlinear [33]. For
all the results presented here, the incident pulse has the time constant τ0 = 2 fs and time delay td = 8 fs.
We calculated for three diﬀerent combinations of material nonlinearity and incident pulse energy per unit

Quantiﬁcation of optical pulsed–plane–wave–shaping by chiral sculptured thin ﬁlms

3.2 Reﬂected and transmitted pulses

[0, 60] µm,
The spatiotemporal evolution of the incoming pulse was computed on the spatial domain z
of which the chiral STF occupies z
[30, 34] µm. Measures of pulse duration and speed were computed
at zr = 36 µm over the time interval [0, 190] fs. The wavelength λcar of the carrier plane wave was set to
either 415, 515, or 615 nm; and the polarization state of the carrier plane wave was chosen as either LCP
or RCP. At visible wavelengths, the selected linear constitutive properties yield refractive indexes that are
commonplace in optics [34].

Let us now examine the eﬀects of the chiral STFs on pulses reﬂected from and transmitted through
them. We are interested mainly in trends in the pulse shape, duration, and speed as the pulse energy per
unit area, carrier wavelength and polarization state, and the nonlinearity of the chiral STF are varied,
as opposed to particular values that the duration, etc., may take on as those parameters are varied.
The shapes of the incident pulses, as exempliﬁed by snapshots of their energy density in Figure 4, are
independent both of the carrier wavelength and carrier polarization state. The incident pulses traversed
[0, 30] µm), were scattered by the STF, and eventually became transmitted signals in the
vacuum (z
vacuous region z

[34, 60] µm and reﬂected signals in the region z

[0, 30] µm.

∈

Let us begin with Case L. Both transmitted and reﬂected pulses are captured in the snapshots of U (z, t)
at time t = 190 fs in Figure 5, where an important trend can be perceived. Irrespective of the polarization
state of the carrier plane wave, the peak energy density of the transmitted pulse increases with increasing
carrier wavelength. That is, the peak value of U (z, t), z > zR, is greater when λcar = 615 nm than when
λcar = 515 or 415 nm for a given carrier polarization state. This trend applies in reverse to the lengths (i.e.,
z–extents) of the transmitted pulses: the transmitted pulses are longer when λcar takes on lower values.

The eﬀects of structural handedness are most evident in the plots of the reﬂected pulses shown in
Figure 6, which contains plots of U (z, t) as a function of time at z = 27.6 µm. The incident pulse is either
LCP or RCP, and λcar = 415, 515, or 615 nm. The energy densities of the reﬂected pulses (which begin at
t

110 fs) are much smaller than those of the incident pulses.

≈
The eﬀects of the circular Bragg phenomenon are evident in Figure 6. In the bottom row of plots, for
which the conditions for the circular Bragg phenomenon are satisﬁed [10], the primary reﬂected pulse
possesses both a larger head and longer tail than when the incident carrier plane wave is LCP (top row
of plots). The longer tail is due to the bleeding of energy from the refracted pulse inside the ﬁlm to the
reﬂected pulse [10], and it is most pronounced when λcar = 515 nm, i.e. when the carrier wavelength lies
in the Bragg regime.

≈

A secondary pulse appears in all six cases beginning at t

155 fs. This smaller pulse is the result of the
reﬂection from the chiral STF / vacuum interface at z = zR. When the incident light is RCP, U (z, t) at
z < zL oscillates rapidly in both the head of the primary pulse and the secondary pulse, a phenomenon
that is due to interference between LCP and RCP components of the reﬂected light [33]. The tail of the
primary reﬂected pulse does not exhibit such large oscillations because a superposition of LCP and RCP
light of substantially the same energy densities is needed to create them [33]. The LCP component of the
reﬂected pulse is of short duration, on the order of the duration of the incident pulse. The pulse–bleeding
eﬀect only operates on the fraction of incident light in the Bragg regime that is RCP, and so the tail of
the primary reﬂected pulse contains mostly RCP light but little to no LCP light when the circular Bragg
phenomenon occurs.

Corresponding plots for the nonlinear Cases N1 and N2 are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
While still small compared to the incident pulses’, the peak values of U (z, t) in the heads of the primary
reﬂected pulses increase from Figures 6 to 8 for given carrier wavelength and polarization state. This is due
to the increasing eﬀects of nonlinearity in Case N1 as compared to Case L, and in Case N2 as compared
to Case N1. An understanding emerges from the frequency domain [10, 15, 33] as follows: for the type of
nonlinearity we studied, a greater value of Ut creates a greater refractive–index mismatch between vacuum
and the chiral STF because of the multiplicative character of the nonlinearity in (5) [33]. The refractive
= 1 are
index of vacuum is unity, and we can see from Figure 2 that the real parts of n2 6
decreasing functions of carrier wavelength at carrier wavelengths greater than 300 nm. When the chiral
STF is nonlinear, the diﬀerences between the refractive indexes of the chiral STF and unity shall become
even greater, and those diﬀerences will be greatest when the intensity of the beam is highest. Hence, the

reﬂection at the pulse head is greater than otherwise.

The peak values of U (z, t) in the secondary pulses are not appreciably diﬀerent from Case L to Case N1
to Case N2 (at least when normalized by the value of Ut, as was done for all the ﬁgures). Evidently,
absorption by the chiral STF reduces the peak energy density of the primary refracted pulse in Case N2
to a greater degree than in Case N1 and in Case N1 to a greater degree than in Case L [33]. In the
frequency domain, absorption manifests itself through positive values of Im (n2) and Im (nd), as seen in
Figure 2. By the time the primary refracted pulses reach zR, their energy densities drop such that the
refractive–index mismatch between vacuum and chiral STF across z = zR is reduced between Cases L,
N1, and N2. Diﬀerences in energy density that remained were further reduced on the return trip of the
secondary pulse from z = zR to z = zL.

Figures 9 to 11 contain plots of U (z, t) as functions of time recorded at z = 36 µm; these are the
transmitted pulses for Cases L, N1, and N2, respectively. The peak values of U (z, t) increase, for given
carrier polarization state, as λcar increases, an eﬀect that is attributable to the presence of the absorption
resonances at ultraviolet wavelengths. The frequency domain behavior of the absorption resonances is
shown in plots of Im (n2) and Im (nd) in Figure 2. Other parameters being equal, more of the bandwidth
of a pulse with lower λcar overlaps the bandwidth of the absorption resonances of the chiral STF than the
bandwidth of a pulse with higher λcar, and hence more absorption occurs in the former case. For given λcar
and carrier polarization state, the peak values of U (z, t)—again normalized to Ut—drop from Figures 9
to 11. Notice that when the incident carrier plane wave is RCP, but not LCP, the transmitted pulses tend
to have a lobed or humped structure, and that the number and sizes of the lobes increase from Case L to
Case N1 to Case N2. Thus, the presence of the chosen nonlinearity distorts the shapes of the transmitted
pulses and tends to make them highly asymmetric, but the eﬀect is prominent only when the structural
handedness of the ﬁlm matches the sense of the circular polarization state of the incident carrier plane
wave.

3.3 Durations of transmitted pulses

What eﬀects does a change in carrier wavelength have on the durations of pulses transmitted through
a chiral STF? Quantiﬁcation of the eﬀects of the carrier wavelength, carrier polarization state, and the
nonlinearity of the chiral STF on τp, τu, and τc is provided through Figure 12, wherein plots of those
quantities for thirteen values of λcar ranging from 395 to 635 nm are shown. The incident carrier plane
wave is again either LCP or RCP, and Cases L, N1, and N2 are again considered. The overall trend in
the plots is a decrease in pulse duration with increasing carrier wavelength. As the carrier wavelength
decreases, the material exhibits greater dispersion due to proximity to the absorption resonances. The
transmitted pulse is consequently of longer duration, because light of longer free–space wavelength has
both greater phase and group velocities in the chiral STF than light of shorter λ0, as can be seen in
Figure 3. This is because n2 (λ0) and nd (λ0) drop with increasing λ0 above the resonance wavelengths
λ1,2,3, as can be seen in Figure 2. Therefore the chosen pulses, which do not possess any negative chirp in
their carrier wavelengths, tend to spread out as they propagate through the chiral STF.

Although that is the overall trend, there is an exception: there appears to be a local maximum for τu
515 nm and the incident carrier plane wave is RCP. We believe that this eﬀect is due to the
when λcar ≈
circular Bragg phenomenon, because the local maximum appears in the vicinity of the center wavelength
of the Bragg regime, and it does not appear when the incident carrier plane wave is LCP. Additionally,
for the same λcar and carrier polarization state, the duration of the pulses tends to increase from Case L
to Case N1 to Case N2.

3.4 Average transmission speed through chiral STF

Plots of cp, cu, and cc in Figure 13 show that they all tend to increase with increasing carrier wavelength, but
decrease slightly with increasing nonlinearity. These two trends are due to the presence of the absorption
resonances in the ultraviolet regime, and the tendency of the nonlinearities to enhance those resonances.
As is clear from Figure 2, the principal refractive indexes of the chiral STF are higher for wavelengths

closer to the resonances, and hence pulsed plane waves with lower λcar are slowed more by the ﬁlm than
pulsed plane waves with higher λcar, as can be seen in Figure 3.

The presence of nonlinearity increases the refractive indexes because of its multiplicative nature in (5),
and hence pulsed plane waves with higher Ut are slowed more than pulsed plane waves with lower Ut when
propagating through a chiral STF. Both cp and cc are heavily aﬀected by pulse shaping by the chiral STF
which is manifested as the alteration of the peaks of the transmitted pulses. For example, notice the jumps
in these quantities that occur between λcar = 455 nm and λcar = 475 nm for Cases N1 and N2 when the
incident carrier plane wave is RCP. The jumps occur due to the appearance of the lobed structure of the
transmitted pulses mentioned in Section 3.2; and, in the case of cc, also due to the the short duration of
the incident pulse as compared to the transmitted one. The calculations of cp and cc require ﬁnding the
peak value of either U (zr, t) or of its correlation with the U (0, t); and so, if one lobe suddenly becomes
larger than another, the peak of the transmitted pulse has to shift. This shift creates a jump in both cp
and cc. Pulse shaping is to be expected to be particularly prominent when pulses of high peak powers pass
through nonlinear chiral STFs, because the eﬀects of nonlinearity are going to be very pronounced then.

4 Concluding remarks

As a result of our calculations, we oﬀer the following conclusions that may be useful to future designers of
optical pulse shapers fabricated with chiral STFs.

Increased nonlinearity reshapes pulses more—as is evident in the increased formation of a lobed
structure—when the carrier polarization state of the incident pulse has the same sense as the struc-
tural handedness of the chiral STF. Attenuation of the transmitted pulse increases when the carrier
wavelength lies closer to the absorption resonances, which is also conﬁrmed by frequency–domain re-
sults [15, 32].
For speciﬁed carrier polarization state, Ut, and pnl, the durations τp, τu, and τc all tend to increase with
decreasing λcar—except for τu in the case of a linear chiral STF under conditions in which the circular
Bragg phenomenon is exhibited. Therefore a chiral–STF–based device could change the durations of
pulses, contingent on the polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave.
For speciﬁed λcar and polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave, the transmitted pulse dura-
tion tends to increase with increasing nonlinear eﬀects. Therefore, any pulse–shaping device based on
nonlinear chiral STFs can only be expected to work over a certain range of incident pulse intensities.
For a given carrier polarization state, Ut, and pnl, the speed cu tends to increase with increasing λcar.
Therefore chiral STFs can function as wavelength–selective delay elements for ultrashort optical pulses.
For speciﬁed λcar and polarization state of the incident carrier plane wave, the speeds cp, cu, and cc
tend to decrease with increasing nonlinear eﬀects.

To conclude, let us note that our presented technique can accommodate other types of nonlinearities—
speciﬁcally, nonlinearities that are not simply multiplicative but must be incorporated through multiple
convolutions, which appear necessary for modelling the nonlinear response of dielectrics to attosecond
pulses [20]. However, the computational capabilities then required will be signiﬁcantly greater than the
ones commonly available today.

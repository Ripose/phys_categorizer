Abstract

The electrodynamical properties of a volume resonator formed by a perodic struc-
ture built from the metallic threads inside a rectangular waveguide (”grid” volume
resonator) is considered. Peculiarities of passing of electromagnetic waves with dif-
ferent polarizations through such volume resonator are discussed.

1 Introduction

Generation of radiation in millimeter and far-infrared range with nonrelativis-
tic and low-relativistic electron beams gives rise diﬃculties. Gyrotrons and cy-
clotron resonance facilities are used as sources in millimeter and sub-millimeter
range, but for their operation magnetic ﬁeld about several tens of kiloGauss
(ω ∼ eH
mc γ) is necessary. Slow-wave devices (TWT, BWT, orotrons)in this
range require application of dense and thin (< 0.1 mm) electron beams,
because only electrons passing near the slowing structure at the distance
≤ λβγ/(4π) can interact with electromagnetic wave eﬀectively. It is diﬃcult to
guide thin beams near slowing structure with desired accuracy. And electrical
endurance of resonator limits radiation power and density of acceptable elec-
tron beam. Conventional waveguide systems are essentially restricted by the
requirement for transverse dimensions of resonator, which should not signiﬁ-
cantly exceed radiation wavelength. Otherwise, generation eﬃciency decreases
abruptly due to excitation of plenty of modes. The most of the above problems

can be overpassed in VFEL [1,2,3,4,5]. In VFEL the greater part of electron
beam interacts with the electromagnetic wave due to volume distributed in-
teraction. Transverse dimensions of VFEL resonator could signiﬁcantly exceed
radiation wavelength D ≫ λ. In addition, electron beam and radiation power
are distributed over the whole volume that is beneﬁcial for electrical endurance
of the system. Multi-wave Bragg dynamical diﬀraction provides mode discrim-
ination in VFEL.

The electrodynamical properties of volume diﬀraction structures composed
from strained dielectric threads was experimentally studied in [6]. In [8] it was
shown that nonrelativistic and low-relativistic electron beams passing through
such structures can generate in wide frequency range up to terahertz.

In the present paper the electrodynamical properties of a ”grid” volume
resonator that is formed by a perodic structure built from the metallic threads
inside a rectangular waveguide (see Fig.1) is considered.

polarisation vector. Suppose this wave falls onto the cylinder placed into the
origin of coordinates and the cylinder axis concides with the axis x (Fig.2) (in
further consideration −→e will be omitted). Two orientations of −→e should be
considered: −→e is parallel to the cylinder axis x and −→e is perpendicular to the
cylinder axis x. For clarity suppose that −→e k 0x.

Thus, considering a set of cylinders with ρn = (yn, zn) one can express the
scattered wave as

Let us consider the wave passing through the layer of cylinders, which axes

Radiation frequencies of our interest is ν ≥ 10 GHz. In this frequency range
skin depth δ is about 1 micron for the most of metals (for example, δCu = 0.66
µm, δAl = 0.8 µm, δW = 1.16 µm and so on). Thus, in this frequency range
the metallic threads can be considered as perfect conducting.

From the analysis [7] follows that the amplitude A0 for the perfect conducting
cylinder for polarization of the electromagnetic wave parallel to the cylinder
axis can be expressed as:

A0(k) =

Amplitude A0 for the perfect conducting cylinder for polarization of the elec-
tromagnetic wave perpendicular to the cylinder axis is as follows [7]:

where R is the cylinder (thread) radius, J0, N0, J ′

Let us consider a particular example. Suppose radiation frequency ν = 10
GHz and the thread radius R = 0.1 mm, then

ReA0(k) ≈ −0.109, ImA0(k) ≈ 0.043,
ReA0(⊥) ≈ −0.00011, ImA0(⊥) ≈ 3.78 · 10−8

and

nk = 0.795 + i · 0.02,
n⊥ = 0.9998 + i · 3.05 · 10−9

Such values for n provides to conclude that, in contrast to a solid metal,
an electromagnetic wave falling on the described ”grid” volume structure is
not absorbed on the skin depth, but passes through the ”grid” damping in
accordance its polarization.

The electromagnetic wave with polarization parallel to the thread axis is
strongly absorbed while passing through the structure (in the above exam-
ple after passing of six planes of threads the wave amplitude loses about 20
%, while through 20 planes passes less then 1/3 of the wave). Absorption for
the wave with polarization perpendicular to the thread axis is weak (after 20
planes the wave amplitude change is only 0.1 · 10−8).

The values ReA0(k) and ImA0(k) are quite large and for polarization parallel
to the thread axis the exact expression (5,7) should be used. Moreover, in
all calculations we should carefully check whether the condition |n − 1| ≪
1 is fullﬁlled. If no, then we should use more strict description of volume
structure and consider rescattering of the wave by diﬀerent threads.In this
case in contrast to (2) the electromagnetic wave is described by:

Ψ = eikz + ΣmFmH (1)

0m(k |−→ρ − −→ρ m|),

where Fm is the eﬀective scattering amplitude deﬁned by

Fm = a0eikzm + a0Σn6=mFnH (1)

0n (k |−→ρ − −→ρ n|),

Analysis shows that use of (14,15) provides the following expression for n2
(compare with (7))

Then for the same example (ν = 10 GHz, R = 0.1 mm) we obtain:

n2 = 1 +

nk = 0.757 + i · 0.0035,
n⊥ = 0.99987 + i · 2.7 · 10−9

(compare this with (12,13)).

Rescattering eﬀects signiﬁcantly change the index of refraction and its imagi-
nary part appears noticeably reduced. From (17) it follows that the amplitude

of the electromagnetic wave with polarization parallel to the thread axis passed
through 20 planes of the ”grid” volume resonator is about 0.8 of the amplitude
of the incident wave.

3 Conclusion

In the present paper the electrodynamical properties of a volume resonator
that is formed by a perodic structure built from the metallic threads inside
a rectangular waveguide is considered. Peculiarities of passing of electromag-
netic waves with diﬀerent polarizations through such volume resonator are
discussed. If in the perodic structure built from the metallic threads diﬀrac-
tion conditions are available, then analysis of expressions (14-16) shows that
in this system the eﬀect of anomalous transmission for electromagnetic waves
could appear similarly to the Bormann eﬀect well-known in the dynamical
diﬀraction theory of X-rays.

We theoretically investigate the response of optical phase
conjugators to incident probe pulses.
In the stable (sub-
threshold) operating regime of an optical phase conjugator
it is possible to transmit probe pulses with a superluminally
advanced peak, whereas conjugate reﬂection is always sublu-
minal. In the unstable (above-threshold) regime, superlumi-
nal response occurs both in reﬂection and in transmission, at
times preceding the onset of exponential growth due to the
instability.

I. INTRODUCTION

A variety of mechanisms is now known to give rise
to superluminal (faster-than-c) group velocities, which
express the peak advancement of electromagnetic pulses
reshaped by material media:

1. Near-resonant absorption [1,2]: anomalous disper-
sion in the linear regime of an absorbing medium
forms the basis for this superluminal reshaping
mechanism.

2. Reduced transmission or evanescent wave forma-
tion (tunneling) in passive dielectric structures
[3–5]:
this reshaping mechanism has been at-
tributed to interference between multiply-reﬂected
propagating pulse components in the structure [6].

3. Soliton propagation in dissipative nonlinear struc-
tures [7]:
superluminal group velocities can oc-
cur in such systems via nonlinear three-wave ex-
changes, as in stimulated Brillouin backscattering
in the presence of dissipation. They also occur in a
nonlinear laser ampliﬁer [8].

4. Pulse propagation in transparent (non-resonant)
amplifying media [9,10]. Superluminal pulse re-
shaping in this regime has been attributed to either
the dispersion [9] or the boundary reﬂections [10]
of the amplifying medium.

5. Tachyonic dispersion in inverted two-level media:
the dispersion in such inverted collective systems
is analogous to the tachyonic dispersion exhibited
by a Klein-Gordon particle with imaginary mass
it has been suggested [12]
[11]. Consequently,

that probe pulses in such media can exhibit su-
perluminal group velocities provided they are spec-
trally narrow. Gain and loss have been assumed to
be detrimental for such reshaping. We note that
Ref. [12] describes an inﬁnite medium and bound-
ary eﬀects on the reshaping have not been consid-
ered.

In this paper we establish a connection between op-
tical phase conjugation and tachyonic-type behavior in
a ﬁnite medium. To that end we study the reﬂection
and transmission of pulses at a phase-conjugating mirror
(PCM), both in its stable and in its unstable operat-
ing regimes. Similar features in other parametric pro-
cesses, such as stimulated Raman scattering and para-
metric down-conversion will be treated elsewhere. The
dispersion relation in inﬁnite PCM media, which allows
for superluminal group velocities, was derived by Lenstra
[13]. Here we address the questions: can superluminal
features be observed in the response of a ﬁnite PCM to
an incident probe pulse, and how can they be reconciled
with causality?

Pulse reshaping by a PCM has been studied before
[14], but never in the context of superluminal behavior.
We show (Sec. II B) that in the well-known stable oper-
ating regime of a PCM, superluminal peak advancement
can occur in transmission but not in conjugate reﬂection,
as was brieﬂy presented in Ref. [15].
In the unstable
regime (Sec. II C), we demonstrate the existence of su-
perluminal peak advancement in both the reﬂected and
transmitted wave response to spectrally narrow analytic
probes. Further insight into these processes is gained by
spatial wavepacket analysis (Sec. III). For sharply-timed
(abruptly modulated, non-analytic) signals (Sec. IV) the
occurrence of spectral components in the frequency zone
where the gain is highest cannot be avoided. These com-
ponents trigger early exponential growth, which is inde-
pendent of the probe pulse shape. In all cases we develop
criteria for the optimization of probe pulse shapes, aimed
at maximizing their superluminal peak advancement and,
in the unstable regime, the delay of the instability onset.
Our phase-conjugating mirror consists of a nonlinear
optical medium with a large third-order susceptibility
χ(3), conﬁned to a cell of length L. Phase conjugation
is obtained through a four-wave mixing (FWM) process
[16]: when the medium is pumped by two intense coun-
terpropagating laser beams of frequency ω0 and a weak
probe beam of frequency ωp = ω0 + δ is incident on the
cell, a fourth beam will be generated due to the non-
linear polarization of the medium. This conjugate wave

The group velocity ∂δ/∂k in the medium can be shown
from (3) to be always larger than c, the speed of light in
vacuum, and the dispersion relation is therefore of the
tachyonic type (see Fig. 2(a)), analogous to the one for
inverted atoms [12]. Because of the superluminal group
velocity caused by this dispersion, the question arises
how wave packets will be reshaped by a PCM. In the
early 80’s, Fisher et al. studied the phase-conjugate re-
ﬂection of pulses of arbitrary shape at a PCM [14]. No
tachyonic eﬀects were found. They distinguished between
two diﬀerent operating regimes of the mirror, stable (if
κ0L < π
In the stable
regime, the response of the mirror is always ﬁnite and
scales with the probe input. The unstable regime cor-
responds to self-generation of conjugate reﬂection from
arbitrarily small probe input, followed by exponential
growth until saturation is reached (due to depletion). Re-
cently we predicted the occurrence of superluminal ad-
vancement of the peak of a suitably chosen input pulse
upon transmission through a stable PCM [15]. Here we
present the full analysis of both the stable and the un-
stable regimes and demonstrate the existence of superlu-
minal eﬀects in both.

2 ).

In order to study pulse reﬂection and transmission at
a PCM, we use the two-sided Laplace transform (TSLT)
technique introduced by Fisher et al. [14]. The basic
approach is summarized in App. A. To begin with, the
reﬂection and transmission amplitudes for a monochro-
matic probe beam incident on a PCM are given by
(Eqs. (A2) and (A3), at x = 0 and x = L, respectively)

Now consider a probe ﬁeld

decreases faster than exponentially as t
[17]. We
obtain the expressions for the resulting reﬂected phase-
conjugate pulse at x = 0, and the transmitted probe
pulse at x = L from the inverse TSLT (see App. A).
In taking the inverse TSLT we separate the singularities
of rcp(is) and tpp(is) in the right-half s-plane, which give
rise to unstable exponentially growing solutions, from the
singularities in the left-half s-plane, which correspond to
stable solutions. The ﬁnal expressions for 0 < κ0L < 3π

In the second terms in (7) and (8) s1 is the unstable pole,
and h1 and h2 are the residues of the reﬂection and trans-
mission amplitudes at this pole. After rewriting the ﬁrst
term in (7) and (8) as a Fourier transform, it is straight-
forward to analyze
Ep(L, t) numerically. If
κ0L < π/2 there are no singularities with Re(s) > 0, so
h1 = h2 = 0 and the second term in (7) and (8) does
not contribute. Hence, the stable regime is deﬁned by
κ0L < π/2, and the unstable by κ0L > π/2. We now
start by studying pulse reshaping by a stable PCM, and
then move on to the unstable regime.

B. Stable regime

Fisher et al. [14] analyzed the phase-conjugate reﬂec-
tion at a PCM in the stable regime (κ0L < π/2). For a
gaussian input pulse they found a delay of the peak of
Ep(0, t). Here we wish to

stable regime is reshaped in such a way that its peak
emerges from the cell before the time it takes to travel the
same distance in vacuum. The central result, obtained
from Eqs. (7) and (8) with h1 = h2 = 0, is depicted in
Fig. 2(b).

The condition on the frequencies in the input signal
for observing the superluminal eﬀect is that they should
be centered away from the gap in the dispersion rela-
tion. The reason for this is that a pulse which is cen-
tered around δ0 = 0 contains positive as well as neg-
ative frequency components whose respective positive
and negative group velocities interact and compensate
in such a way that no superluminal advancement occurs.
For a pulse centered further up on the dispersion curve
(Fig. 2(a)), however, superluminal peak advancement is
obtained (at δ0 > 2 c/L, curves 2 and 3 in Fig. 2(b)).
This superluminal peak advancement depends on three
parameters: the temporal width of the incoming pulse
∆t, the central frequency of the incoming pulse δ0 and
the coupling strength in the medium κ0. By ﬁxing κ0
and varying simultaneously ∆t and δ0 the superluminal

eﬀect can be (numerically) optimized in several ways.
In absolute terms, we ﬁnd a maximal attainable peak
0.88 L/c. But since this advance-
advancement of
ment, even though large, would only be a small eﬀect if
the pulse is broad in time, it is also useful to optimize
the ratio r = peak advancement/pulse width. We ob-

tain a maximal relative peak advancement of r
In phase-conjugate reﬂection no such superluminal eﬀect
appears: the time at which the peak of the reﬂected sig-
nal emerges at x = 0 is always later than t = 0, the time
at which the maximum of the input pulse entered the
cell.

For δ0 = 0.1 c/L we see that the reﬂected signal starts
growing exponentially as soon as the incoming pulse
reaches the cell. However, for an incident pulse centered
around a frequency further away from the gap in the dis-
0.28 c/L), the reﬂected pulse
persion relation (at δ0 ≈
exhibits a local maximum before the exponential growth
sets in. This peak is clearly advanced with respect to the
peak of the incoming signal. Since κ0L is chosen close to
π/2, the reﬂected pulse is greatly ampliﬁed [18].

For large δ0, where the dispersion relation becomes

4

±

c(k0 ±

asymptotically linear (δ =
k)), the reshaping
of the reﬂected pulse is only minor and the superluminal
eﬀect is no longer noticeable for this pulse. In order to
optimize the superluminal response preceding exponen-
tial growth, one must thus have δ0 small (for maximum
advancement) and κ0L close to π/2 (for maximum inten-
sity and delay of exponential growth).

Just as in the stable regime, we need to optimize three
parameters simultaneously: κ0, δ0 and ∆t. One way of
doing this is by using the exact expression (7) and ana-
lyzing it numerically, but this does not give much insight
into the interplay between these parameters. Another
method is to ﬁnd an approximation of the exact result,
which allows for an analytical treatment of a certain class
of incident pulses and yields quantitatively good agree-
ment with the exact result in that case.

In order to obtain such an approximation we con-
sider the conjugate reﬂection amplitude (4) in the limit

κ0c, corresponding to incident pulses with a large
temporal bandwidth compared to L/c. Equation (4) then

The optimal superluminal eﬀect is found if the reﬂected
intensity is large at tmax and close to zero at tmin and the
tmax is as large as possible. In order to
separation tmin −
obtain the maximal relative advancement we numerically
scan through the three-parameter space (κ0, δ0, ∆t), ﬁx-
ing κ0L and varying the other two parameters simultane-
ously. Using (17), this reveals that the reﬂected pulse is

very sensitive to δ0 (for ﬁxed κ0 and ∆t, see also Fig. 3)
and only arises for incident pulses that are suﬃciently
20 L/c). For signals with broad
broad in time (∆t ≥
spectra, the strong inﬂuence of frequency components in
the instability gap prevents the formation of a discernible
pulse response before exponential growth sets in. Fur-
thermore, κ0L should be close to π/2, because otherwise
the fast onset of exponential growth masks the reﬂected
pulse. In the optimal case one can ﬁnd an advancement

The results for transmission of a gaussian through an
active PCM are qualitatively the same as for phase-
conjugate reﬂection. The amplitude of the advanced

δ0 and ∆t for which it arises. The approximation (14)
cannot be used to describe the transmission in the sta-
ble regime, which occurs for larger values of δ0 than the
superluminal response in the unstable regime. The as-

III. PULSE REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION
- SPATIAL ANALYSIS

To gain further insight into pulse reshaping by a PCM,
we follow an incoming gaussian pulse in space. One can
then observe the following stages: (1) the probe wave
packet approaches the cell; (2) it propagates as an ”op-
tical quasiparticle” (consisting of a probelike part travel-
ing to the right and a conjugatelike part traveling to the
left) [19] in the cell and (3) the reﬂected phase-conjugate
and transmitted probe packets leave the cell. We employ
again the TSLT of Sec. II. The reﬂected phase-conjugate
and transmitted probe pulses at position x in the nonlin-
ear medium and time t are given by (App. A)

|Ep(x, t)
but since we now consider
|Ep(x, t)
|
|
the normalization is diﬀerent. We see how the probe
pulse approaches the cell at t =
2 L/c. At t = 0,
when the forward tail of the pulse has entered the cell, a
small reﬂected phase-conjugate pulse has developed and
is traveling simultaneously in the opposite direction. At
t = 5 L/c the advancement of the transmitted probe peak
6 L,
is clearly visible: the position of the peak is xpeak ≈
whereas it would have been 5 L if the pulse had prop-
agated through vacuum (see dashed vertical line in the
ﬁgure).

the probe pulse enters the cell. For a spectrally narrow
pulse centered around δ0 = 0, exponential growth sets in
immediately for that part of the probe which has reached
the cell boundary at x = 0. For an incoming pulse cen-
0.3 c/L the ”transient” behavior is re-
tered around δ0 ∼
covered. This is illustrated in Fig. 5: at t = 0 the growth
of the incoming signal has set in in the PCM, but in addi-
tion there is a clear phase-conjugate pulse with a superlu-
minally advanced peak traveling to the left. At the same
time one sees a superluminal ”kink” in the transmitted
probe response: the instability prevents the formation of
a full gaussian-shaped transmitted probe pulse for this
set of parameters. The t = 10 L/c time plot shows the
superluminally reﬂected signal on a larger scale.

IV. CHOPPED SIGNALS

Analytic gaussians are of little value as far as informa-
tion transfer is concerned, or as a check whether the ob-
served superluminal eﬀects are in agreement with causal-
ity [6,9,20]. For that purpose, one needs an incoming
modulated or chopped signal. Interesting questions then
arise: how is the sudden change in the input pulse re-
ﬂected in the output pulse? How are the reﬂected re-
sponse and exponential growth in the unstable regime
aﬀected by this change? We have already shown else-
where that for probe transmission in the stable regime,
the edge of a chopped incoming signal is always transmit-
ted causally [15]. Figure 6 shows the transmitted probe
response in the unstable regime for an incident gaussian
pulse which is suddenly switched oﬀ at t = 0.

Fig. 3 and ttr indicates the time it takes to traverse the cell
in vacuum.

|E

|

We see that the sudden change in the incoming pulse
is carried over into the transmitted probe response at
L/c, the time it takes to traverse the cell
time ttr ≡
in vacuum. The ”information content” of the pulse is
thus transmitted with the speed of light, after which the
exponential growth due to the instability immediately
sets in. Note that the superluminal peak advancement of
the reﬂected conjugate pulse remains, just as for the full
gaussian of Fig. 3. This advancement does not violate
causality, but is a pulse reshaping eﬀect. The fact that
the chopped edge of the pulse is transmitted with the
speed of light can be seen more clearly by expressing
Ep(x, t) as (App. A)

suddenly switched on at t = t0, the transmitted response
only starts at t = t0 + L/c, in agreement with causality.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have theoretically studied the re-
ﬂection and transmission of wave packets at a phase-
conjugating mirror. Our main ﬁndings are

(a) In the stable operating regime (for κ0L < π/2), the
peak of the transmitted signal can exhibit a superlumi-
nal peak-traversal time [15]. The conditions for this eﬀect
are that the incoming analytic probe signal be spectrally
narrow and centered around a frequency suﬃciently far
away from the parametric resonance (δ = 0 in Fig. 2(a)).
The maximum advancement obtained is
0.88 L/c and
the maximum ratio (peak advancement)/(pulse width)
0.08. No such eﬀect is found in the reﬂected phase-
∼
conjugate response, whose peak is always delayed with re-
spect to the one of the incoming probe signal (Sec. II B).
The salient advantage of superluminal peak transmission
in this stable regime is that the output pulse is undis-
torted.

∼

(b) In the unstable regime (for κ0L > π/2), for incident
probe pulses with a temporal width much larger than
L/c, a pronounced ”transient” reﬂected phase-conjugate
response develops before the onset of exponential growth
due to the instability. This pulse response exhibits a
superluminally advanced peak, both in phase-conjugate
reﬂection and in probe transmission (Sec. II C). The ad-
vancement and intensity are maximal for κ0L close to
π/2 and the response is very sensitive to the central fre-
quency δ0 of the incoming pulse.

(c) We have demonstrated (Sec. IV) that the superlu-
minal features are observable only for temporally broad
analytic pulses, in agreement with the principle of causal-
ity, whereas a sudden (non-analytic) change in the inci-
dent probe pulse propagates with the speed of light.

∼

∼

∼

Finally, the question arises how these pulse reshaping
eﬀects can be observed. For a realistic PCM, consist-
10−2 m, coupling strengths
ing of a cell of length L
1010s−1 have been reached, so that
of κ0c
c/L
∼
tan2(κ0L)
1 [22]. In order to observe pulse reshaping
in the stable operating regime of this PCM, one needs
an incident probe pulse of width
0.1 ns whose peak
is then transmitted with a superluminal peak transmis-
sion time
0.01 ns. To enter the unstable regime, the
PCM has to be operated using pulsed pump beams. The
pump pulses should be long enough to allow for observa-
tion of the ”transient” pulse response, but short enough
to avoid the instability eﬀects. Since the width of the
superluminally reﬂected and transmitted response is on
the order of
10 L/c, nanosecond pump-pulse durations
are required.

APPENDIX A: TWO-SIDED LAPLACE
TRANSFORM TECHNIQUE

∞

In this appendix we brieﬂy outline the two-sided
Laplace transform (TSLT) technique introduced by
Fisher et al. [14]. The TSLT is deﬁned as ˜
≡
−∞ dt F (∗)(x, t) e−st.
It is only valid for functions
F (x, t) that diminish faster than exponentially at times
R
t
[17]. Its advantage compared to the the usual
one-sided Laplace transform is that it also applies to
functions that do not vanish at t < 0. The starting point
of the analysis is to apply the TSLT to the four-wave
∗
mixing equations (2) with F (x, t) =
c (x, t).
We then obtain the coupled equations

where rcp = hr(x = 0) and tpp = ht(x = L). The choice
of contour γ in (A4) and (A5) is in agreement with causal-
ity, which means in this case that it is to the right of all
the singularities of rcp(is) (and tpp(is)). The singularities
in the right-half s-plane give rise to exponential growth of
Ep(x, t). The integrals (A4) and (A5) can be
Ec(x, t) and
evaluated by taking the contribution of these poles sep-
arately and rewriting the remaining integral as a Fourier
integral, see (7) and (8).

They can also be evaluated in another way, which is es-
pecially insightful when regarding non-analytic, chopped
probe pulses (Sec. IV). To that end we rewrite (A4) and
(A5) as

[19] The name ”optical quasiparticles” is introduced in view
of the analogy [13,21] with the quasiparticle excitations

Just as these superconductor quasiparticles have a mixed
electron-hole character, the optical quasiparticles consist
of both a probe and a conjugate part.

Abstract. Doughnut shaped light beam has been generated from Gaussian
mode (T EM00) cw-Ti sapphire laser. After splitting the pump beam into two
equal intensity components and introducing unequal convergence and phase delay
while they are recombined it results in doughnut mode. Such a beam is tunable
and have long propagation length. The evanescent ﬁeld generated by 360 mW
(at 780 nm wavelength) of such a beam creates optical ﬁeld of 600 nm decay
length with a 5.75 neV repulsive dipole potential. Thus cold Rb atoms (at 10µK
or less temperature) released from MOT can be reﬂected by the surface so that
the atoms are collected ultimately at the bottom of the prism. By focussing such
doughnut beam with 8 cm focal length converging lens, the dark radius reduces
to 22µ. We also observe such beam to contain azimuthal phase as well as radial
phase distribution.

1. Introduction

2

Localization of tiny particle by doughnut beam was ﬁrst demonstrated by Ashkin
[1]which initiated interest on T EM01 laser beam and its application in atom
manipulation. Besides, evanescent ﬁeld atom mirror proposed by Cook and Hill [2]
and subsequent interest on atom mirror led to observation of atom reﬂection [3]. In the
same way conﬁnement of cold atom by hollow core laser beam was realized [4]. These
two mechanism of atom photon interaction have been nicely manifested through the
proposal of atom funnel experiment [5]. Furthermore this hollow core beam (T EM01)
has drawn increasing attention because of its usefulness to manipulate and guide [6]
cold atoms through its dark core, its ability to conﬁne tiny particles [1] as well as atom
reﬂection and collection in atom funnel experiment [5]. With computer generated
hologram such a beam has been generated [7]. It is also possible to use cylindrical
lens [8], or modiﬁed intracavity mirror of laser [9] to generate T EM01 mode. Using
hollow core optical ﬁber a doughnut shaped optical near-ﬁeld was also proposed [10]
In atom funneling a double cone prism was used to
in order to guide cold atoms.
generate cylindrical optical ﬁeld distribution from a Gaussian beam [5]. The success
of the Ashkin trap was the scattering force of photon generated by strong optical ﬁeld
distribution around the particle. However it gradually emerged that the theory of
dipole force proposed by Askar’yan [11] can also help to control atoms [12]. For such
application doughnut beam can be coupled to a hollow prism container receiving cold
atoms so that localized surface waves are generated to collect cold atoms and preserve
its state through reﬂection or, thereafter transport the atoms thought a bottom hole
[5].

Various degree of dark-bright contrast and longer eﬀective length of propagation
are useful characteristics for its application in atom manipulation. With a presence
of non-zero optical intensity at the center a longitudinal scattering force as well
as transverse dipole force can eﬀectively transport the atoms. Double cone prism
produced beam [5] have steeper optical potential distribution across the bright ring,
which is suitable for trapping, than that generated by hologram or other means,
however such mode suﬀers quicker decay with propagation length. Here we report
generation of various doughnut shaped beams that covers longer propagation length
as well as various degrees of dark bright contrast and analyze its usefulness for atom
manipulation.

Cold Rb atoms are generated in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). In order to collect
a large number of such cold atoms a thin walled empty inverted pyramidal prism is
kept below the MOT center so that after release from the trap the cold atoms fall
into the prism under gravitational pull. When light have total internal reﬂection at
glass-air interface an exponentially decaying evanescent ﬁeld is created [2], a typical
range normal to the surface is the optical wavelength of the light used. If frequency
of the laser be slightly higher than the resonance absorption line of Rb atoms then
the evanescent ﬁeld can generate repulsive dipole force. Based on this principle blue
detuned doughnut beam is applied through the bottom of the prism to induce enough
atomic reﬂectivity at the prism wall and cold Rb atoms are collected by the prism [5].

2. Experimental

In order to generate T EM01 beam we use two-beam interference in a Michaelson
type interferometer. Figure 1(a) shows schematic diagram of the experimental setup.

A single mode Gaussian beam comes from Ti-saphire laser (maximum 1 W optical
power). This beam is split into two equal intensity components by a non-polarizing
beam splitter. These two beams are then passed through two diﬀerent lenses F1, F2 in
order to focus along its path. Besides, to recombine and make these beams interfere,
two mirrors are placed in a Michelson interferometer conﬁguration so the beams are
reﬂected back to the beam splitter. One of the mirrors have PZT actuator mounted
at its back so that mirror displacement control in nm level be achievable. Thus the
beams again pass through the respective lenses and have further convergence. The
focal lengths of lenses F1 and F2 are selected experimentally so that the beams are
focussed close to the beam splitter after their second pass and their divergence beyond
their respective focal points are appropriate to generate T EM01 mode. In this case
the eﬀective focal lengths are f1 = 22.2 cm f2 = 19.3 cm. This results in minimum
beam waists of 110µ and 96µ respectively at about 1.2 cm separation. Focal length
of output collimator F3 is 40 cm.

2.1. Analysis of beam mode formation

Each of the beams in the interferometer can be analyzed by taking Fourier transform
of the input beam. This is because Fourier transform can convert frequency domain
spectrum into spatial distribution, which means a monochromatic collimated laser
beam while passed through a converging lens results in a single point in focal plane
where it forms the image.

Although doughnut beam has been described by Laguerre polynomial, Gaussian
function, angular momentum quantum number [13,14], however it has also been
observed that focussed Gaussian beam acquires a axial phase [15] which is known
as Gouy phase. With this we try to analyze the result with simpliﬁed theoretical
model speciﬁc to our system and look into various characteristics experimentally.

simplicity let’s start with one of the two beams. While passing through converging
lens let the electric ﬁeld amplitude be E(x′, y′, z′) at focal plane X ′

It has been observed that the two beams interfere after their respective focal
planes and the topology of generated pattern does not change while the resulting
beam diverges. Thus, while a third lens (F3) is used at some other distance apart in
order to collimate the output beam with desired waist size it does not introduce any
modiﬁcation to beam pattern. It has also been observed that position of this third
lens does not aﬀect beam topology either. Let the lens F3 be placed at X ′′
Y ′′ plane.
The resulting beam diameter is 5 mm.

As the beam widths are ﬁnite and unequal so the interference pattern will depend
not only on relative axial delay between these two beams but also on its spatial optical
ﬁeld distribution. To simplify the analysis, let’s introduce a phase part related to
(δ mod λ) as (sin θ) factor to E2 (x′, y′, z′

This is the simpliﬁed generating function for diﬀerent shape of the output beam
for delay δ. This is called ′simpliﬁed′ because of a number of signiﬁcant assumptions
have been made so far. First and the prominent one is that the phase containing
terms A1f i are equal for i=1 and 2. Secondly, we implicitly assumed that each of the
two interfering beams do not have any azimuthal phase or helicity to alter intensity
distribution of output beams. This is true for Gaussian beam however we will see
later that while the output beam interfere with its mirror image, it exhibits transverse
phase distribution. The possible beam shapes that are obtainable experimentally is
shown in ﬁgure 2,3.

As seen in the ﬁgure 2&3 not all the possible conﬁgurations correspond to
doughnut shape except for ﬁgures within the range of ﬁgure 2. As we see from the
above expression (3) that, at x′′ = 0 = y′′ or, at beam axis, the E (x′′, y′′, z′′) becomes

The ﬁgure 3(d) and 3(h) correspond to additional phase delay, introduced by the

PZT actuator of ﬁgure 1(a).

2.2. Topological Symmetry

∈

Thus we see from equation (3) that the achievable beam modes repeat after each λ
delay. The diﬀerent beam proﬁles thus generated have topological symmetry, meaning
the transformation from one beam structure to another is continuous, reversible and
forms a closed set. Figure 3 shows the full range of available beam modes at several
discrete optical delay in the range of δ = 780 nm, and for any delay δ more than
integral multiple of λ, the (δ mod λ) parameter becomes eﬀective and the generated
beam mode falls within that shown in ﬁgure 3. Thus we can categorize the set (ﬁgure
3) as a topological space with a pair (X, T ) consisting of a set X of collection of possible
beam modes and a family T of subsets of X so that: (a) an empty set Φ
X and
X
T (b) T is closed under arbitrary union (c) T is closed under ﬁnite intersection.
Although topologically it is not allowed to pierce or join two ends of a structure because
of possible ambiguity in regeneration and reversibility, however creating a dark or
bright center, the set of beam proﬁles that can be regenerated are unambiguous and
without any arbitration. This argument is valid for zero intensity points. In this we
can introduce a blank screen as empty set (Φ) which while added or subtracted from
any member does not introduce any change, in practice this corresponds to generating
delay among the two beams so that a particular beam conﬁguration can be maintained,
which in other words means the beam mode locking. Embedding this theory into an
ideal experimental situation it corresponds to zero delay to a stabilized conﬁguration.
The condition (b) states T is closed under arbitrary union, which implies that with
any possible delay the achievable beam proﬁle will always lie within that shown in
the ﬁgure 3 or expressible by equation (3) as the eﬀective delay (δ mod λ) always lies
within 0 to 780 nm. Thus any subset of X are open and the collection T of open
subsets can thus be called topology for X.

∈

With this categorical simpliﬁcation we can further classify this experiment and its
related results to look into its further characteristics. To proceed we broadly devide
the set X into two subsets, one with darker axial proﬁle, ﬁgure 2 or ﬁgure 3(a)-3(d),
and the other with brighter axial intensity distribution, ﬁgure 3(e)-3(h). Let these
be subset A and B. As we know that in the Michaelson interferometer one can get
two beams, one goes away from the laser and other return towards the laser. We
identify this second beam with a prime e.g. B′ for beams with brighter axial proﬁle
like that of ﬁgure 3(e) to ﬁgure 3(h) that returns towards the laser. We select A and
B′, as these are simultaneously observable complementary beam structures the sum of
which always gives the total beam intensity (assuming zero loss through the optics).
Similarly B and A′ can form another complementary set. Thus the delay that results
in evolution of A simultaneously generates B′. To look into this situation analytically
we take the following logical and analytical method.

A homeomorphism between spaces A and B′ is a continuous map f : A
A, so that f (g(b′)) = b′ for all b′

B′
B′,
which has an inverse continuous map g : B′
A . Thus the maps f and g introduces one-to-one and onto
and g(f (a)) = a for all a
function (bijection) between the spaces A and B′. We can see from experiment that A
and B′ are simultaneously generated and forms two subsets of topological spaces that
are distinctly measurable and identiﬁable in real space. In the following we will look
into explicit expression of f and g in accordance to above formalism and investigate

how this leads to interrelating the two spaces A and B′ to stabilize A using information
from B′.

We formulate the f and g in terms of delay and represent with θ, which is a
function of δ. For f and g as continuous and inverse of each other it is suﬃcient
to show that the square matrix representing f and g are inverse of each other. Let

represents the same physical situation in a convenient form. We can consider p1
and q1 as bases of the topology because any member of T can be expressed as a linear
combination of p1 and q1. Taking E (x′′, y′′, z′′) = a and b′ = E′ (x′′, y′′, z′′) say, a
matrix equation can be formed as follows

Or a = [p1 cos θ + q1 sin θ] and b′ = [p1 cos θ

q1 sin θ]. In practice the negative
sign in b′ arises as θ should change by π for the beam B′. Thus the transformation
relations corresponding to f and g are unitary, reversible and the elements that are
generated in this way preserves total optical energy. Consequently, as is evident,
for the delay (or θ) as independent variable of the transformation, the beam intensity
corresponding to a and b′ becomes unequal, except for θ
= (4π + 1) π/4, which implies
one of two beams acquires higher intensity in expense of the other. Table 1 shows the
optical power of doughnut beam at various stages of beam mode.

A point to be noted is that, although a and b′ represents members of A and B′ we
can not use them in the above expressions to analyze their nature of continuity, that is
test for monotonously increasing or decreasing nature will fail. This is because, as has
been mentioned earlier, both a and b′ are not uniform or their identity at diﬀerent θ
are not similar because of topological modiﬁcations. Thus, one can not get condition
for maxima or minima by equating ﬁrst derivative to zero.

optical power measured. Table 1 shows the optical beam intensity at various mode of
the output beam [17, 18].

Note that there is some loss of light at the optics, however the measured A : B′

beam power ratio remains constant.

The ﬁgure 1 shows that the optical delay is controlled by piezo-electric actuator
attached to one of Michaelson-mirrors, it controls the beam mode. Besides, there may
be electrical noise, external mechanical vibration as well as some other disturbance
may create unsteady situation unless and otherwise special precaution is adopted. We
have already observed that the set of beam modes form a topological set where A and
B′ are interrelated (7) and the null element of which while added or subtracted from
the set X does not have any eﬀect. Now we shall use this idea to create a single element
set or a stabilized doughnut beam output in which the null element will be functionally
generated through locking circuit. This is useful in understanding locking the beam
mode to a predetermined form. We know that f and g are inverse operations of each
other. If there is some noise that arbitrarily generates f a complementary process g
should be created to bring the system back to its initial state. We achieve this with
the help of a photo-detector (PD1) and lock-in ampliﬁer combination and feed this
signal back to the PZT actuator (ﬁgure 1(a)) so that the feed back signal can stabilize
the system.

This has been achieved quite simply because the B′ beam diameter is about 5
mm. With a 0.5 mm at the PD1 window aperture of PD1 while placed in its path, can
discriminate a minute change in beam mode. Chopping the beam B′ and feeding the
electrical output of the PD1 to a lock in ampliﬁer (LIA) the g is generated. This is
more evident from ﬁgure 2 that beam intensity distribution continuously varies with
radial distance from beam axis. Thus while a change of beam proﬁle with rise in θ
can lead to increased PD signal, a corresponding fall in θ leads a change in PD signal
on the reverse.

3.2. Focussed doughnut beam

One of several advantages that this beam have is its long propagation length; more
than 3 meters observed in the laboratory. While doughnut beam is used to guide
atom or as an instrument to manipulate atom in a localized space, the characteristics

of such focussed beam will be useful. To observe doughnut beam mode under focus
we used gold coated ﬂat-top aperture ﬁber probe (ﬁgure 4(a)) to pick up optical signal
from minimum beam waist.

Figure 4(b) shows the schematic diagram of free space measurement setup. The
ﬁber probe is mounted on a 3-axis nanomover stage (Melles Griot Inc.) in combination
with a PZT actuator of 60 nm/Volt sensitivity. Figure 4(c) shows the measured free
space beam proﬁle. Accuracy of free space measurement has some limitation due to
scattering at the ﬁber probe as well as non-zero transmission of the gold coating that
covers the probe tip. Single tapered ﬁber probe has been fabricated by conventional
chemical etching process and making a 180 nm gold coating over the tip. A 370
nm aperture has been created by focussed ion beam (FIB) technique, ﬁgure 4(a). A
details of such method can be found in [19].

After that we carried out the optical near-ﬁeld measurement where the optical
ﬁeld is ”blocked” beyond the probe tip and the scattering eﬀect becomes minimum.
Figure 5(c) shows the schematic diagram of the optical near-ﬁeld measurement setup.
Figure 5(a,b) shows the probe used in this measurement. Figure 5(d) shows the optical
near-ﬁeld distribution of the focussed doughnut beam measured in this way. About
20µ dark diameter has been recorded. It shows a dark hole probably exists along the

minimum beam waist at the focal plane and the TEM01 mode can have a continuous
dark core even though the focal plane, when it is focussed. Such a characteristic can
be useful while transporting cold atoms through the dark core and manipulating in a
small dimension.

3.3. Evanescent optical near-ﬁeld

The focussed doughnut beam proﬁle as discussed above, has been the result of optical
nearﬁeld measurement. So at this stage we will discuss about optical near-ﬁeld
generated by doughnut beam in atom funnel system, measure the evanescent ﬁeld
and estimate most probable behaviour of Rb atoms at the funnel wall.

3.3.1. Evanescent atom funnel
In order to measure the optical near-ﬁeld generated at
the funnel surface of the atom funnel experiment, we use bare long ﬁber probe, ﬁgure
5(a), (b). A similar chemical etching technique, as described before, has been used
with longer etching time to create long tip ﬁber probe for evanescent ﬁeld measurement
in funnel. Fiber probe-tip angle is about 23 degrees whereas for a short probe tip
length of 6µ at ﬁber core of diameter 40µ. Thus in the evanescent ﬁeld measurement
over hollow prism it is inconvenient to use short ﬁber probe (for funnel surface, as the
vertical wall angle is about 450). As discussed earlier total internal reﬂection generates
surface wave or evanescent ﬁeld. The doughnut beam while is incident in such a way
that a total internal reﬂection takes place, then a doughnut shaped evanescent ﬁeld will
be created at the prism surface. The measured optical near-ﬁeld intensity distribution
is as shown in ﬁgure 5(d).

The ﬁber probe is placed within the evanescent ﬁeld range and it is kept in a
predetermined position by applying a small vibration to the probe tip and collecting
corresponding error signal.

Application of doughnut beam in atom funnel has been developing [5]. In this
system the necessary beam proﬁle should have at least 250µ dark diameter along with
2.5 mm beam waist. Cold atoms are generated in magneto-optical trap and collected
by the hollow prism with the help of the evanescent ﬁeld created by doughnut beam.
2.5 cm2
The prism wall thickness is about 3 mm and is composed of three 2.5
glass plates glued together. The lower tip of the prism is polished to a ﬂat triangular
surface, at the center there is a 250µ hole. Doughnut beam is aligned at the bottom
of the prism so that dark center lies at the prism hole and the beam gets total internal
reﬂection at the inner surface. This illumination is synchronized with release of cold
atoms from MOT so that the atoms bounce over the inner wall of the prism and
collected through the bottom hole

×

At three diﬀerent optical power evanescent ﬁeld of various strength have been
measured. However the measured range of the ﬁeld primarily depend on the detector
noise level and collection eﬃciency of the ﬁber probe. Thus with intense doughnut
beam we can detect longer range of the ﬁeld.

The characteristic decay length at which the evanescent ﬁeld intensity decays to
e−1 to that at the glass surface has been estimated from experimental result. The start
of the exponential decay has been taken as the maximum value for the evanescent ﬁeld.
The minimum of the exponential decay corresponds to NEP of the detector system.
Thus the range of the evanescent ﬁeld is the range from the maximum evanescent ﬁeld
to the NEP level, which has also been estimated from experimental results.

The probe tip cross section has about 42 nm diameter. Here we can make another
practical approximation. While the doughnut beam is incident from the bottom of
prism, the three planar walls of the prism surfaces will be uniformly covered with
optical near ﬁeld . This is because the wall thickness is about 3.0 mm whereas each
2.5 cm2 and the angle that the three edges make with vertical is 45
wall area is 2.5
degrees. Besides, width of the bright ring is about 2.5 mm. Combining all these with
repeated total internal reﬂections both at the inner and outer surface of the walls we
can approximate to an almost uniform distribution of optical near-ﬁeld. Thus with 360
10−15 m2
mW beam the areal intensity distribution will be 213.3 W/m2. With 5.54
ﬁber probe area optical ﬁeld will be collected and measured. Assuming 70% collection
eﬃciency at the probe tip, because of refractrive index mismatch between probe and
air, and also there be another 30% optical power loss at ﬁber-photodetector (PD2)
coupling. To calibrate optical ﬁeld distribution inside the funnel wall we take the noise
equivalent power (NEP) of the system as the reference. Observed LIA noise level is

3.3.2. Dipole force Grazing incidence reﬂection of atoms by evanescent ﬁeld has
been discussed since 1987 [20,21]. A blue detuned laser light while gets total internal
reﬂection in glass gives a layer of repulsive evanescent ﬁeld over the glass-air interface.
At the blue detuning of laser line, because of faster change in laser ﬁeld compared to
that of atom it responds in a time frame lagging with respect to the external ﬁeld.
We can assume a frequency range (seen by the atom, or in atomic frame) in which
this dipole force is appreciably high, lies close to resonance frequency of Rb atom. It
is obvious that it can not happen at all higher frequencies or in any range of blue
detuning. The principal diﬀerence between photon scattering (or photon reﬂection by
atom) and this dipole force is that in the former case the incident photon frequency
remains almost same to that of the scattered one, whereas in the latter its wave nature
takes precedence. Thus without going into quantum mechanical analysis using dressed
state formalism as well as drawing a sharp boundary between these two interaction
mechanisms we can treat this atom kinetics semi-classically.

In free space if we assume a stationary photon distribution that corresponds to
total doughnut beam power then the Rb atom at 10µK temperature will come across
about 250 photons per second on its path, which in this case will be hypothetical
limiting photon collision rate with cold and falling Rb atoms. To estimate the number
of photons faced by Rb atoms at the prism wall, we take area under the ”decay curve”.
However one may argue that when Rb atom comes close to the glass surface a localized
ﬁeld (dielectric constant) will change and a large number of photons will tunnel across
the barrier to collide with the Rb atoms. We eliminate this situation for ground
state Rb atoms having low multipole moment, falling with small velocity normal to
the surface, thus repulsive dipole force will be stronger before reaching the photon

Doughnut beam..

13

tunneling range. Moreover, if Rb atoms do have suﬃcient velocity to reach to the
photon tunneling range, the atoms will again be reﬂected due to velocity dissipation
and photon scattering. Thus not only very slow atoms can reﬂect from the surface
but also at higher atomic velocity the atom reﬂection can again be observed.

instead of using theoretical value for 2κ, we shall estimate it from experimental result.
Thus the retarding dipole potential is distributed functionally similar to optical ﬁeld
intensity distribution. With 0.36 W doughnut beam power, the dipole potential

Apart from atom optical interaction described above there will be attractive van
der Waals force that acts on Rb atoms due to proximity of the glass surface,UV dw(t) =
λ m−1. It has been known that atoms at a distance
−
of more than 0.2λ the eﬀective force is the repulsive dipole force and Van der Waals
force have little eﬀect on atom repulsion beyond such a distance [12]. Thus considering
the reﬂected atoms we can neglect the Van der Waals force at a distance longer than
156 nm. So the repulsive optical force can be written as

−

5.75 exp (

Uopt ≈

2κt) neV, for t >156 nm. We know from evanescent ﬁeld
measurement that 1/2κ = 600 nm. By integrating this potential from inﬁnity to 156
nm one can get work done on Rb atom while it moves toward the evanescent surface.
Cold Rb atoms at 10µK temperature have most probable kinetic energy of 1.3 neV,
which is smaller than the 5.75 neV. Thus cold Rb atoms will be reﬂected by the
evanescent ﬁeld created by the doughnut beam at the funnel surface.

3.3.3. Dissipation In addition to dipole kinetics near the evanescent surface, atom
may also have dissipation of its energy at the evanescent ﬁeld interaction [23]. Now we
will consider dissipative eﬀect of evanescent ﬁeld interaction in which atom looses part
of its velocity near the surface. Rb atoms (say 85Rb) have two ground levels F=2,3
separated by 3.036 GHz frequency.
It has been observed that while blue detuning
increases from 1 GHz to 1.5 GHz the number of reﬂected atoms also increases [24].
With this trend we can assume that due to atomic velocity and the consequent Doppler
shift a transition takes place from F=2 state by absorbing the photon (frequency ν1)
and a subsequent emission at frequency ν2 to bring the atom back to F=2 state. Thus
as the blue detuning increases so the transition probability rises. So from conservation
of momentum, mu2 −

where m is mass of Rb atom, and λtrans corresponds to blue detuning (with respect

the atom reﬂection from the prism wall, as has been observed. Additionally we are
considering atoms in motion so the atom will see the laser line with Doppler shift,

3.3.4. Radiation force
In addition to the dipole interaction, van der Waals force and
velocity dissipation, there will be photon scattering from atoms as the atoms follow
Maxwell Boltzmann velocity distribution. Let Rb atomic radius be r0 = 0.298nm.
Then most probable number of atomic collision with an evanescent photon will
be n = πr2

of scattering or photon reﬂection by atom can be described simply as follows.
u1 = 12mm/sec for
Conservation of momentum gives m (u2 −
each head-on colision with one photon. The estimated temperature of Rb atoms
falling on the prism is 10µK [5]. Accordingly, the most probable velocity of Rb atoms
will be 44 mm/sec. Thus the atoms need 4 ’pure’ scattering with photon if there be
no induced dipole force and no velocity dissipation. As we can see from experiment
the probable number of atom-photon collision is more than 6 (rather it is estimated
to be around 1575), so atom reﬂection probability is high at 360 mW doughnut beam
power.

4. Azimuthal phase

A characteristic property doughnut beam is its helicity or axial phase distribution
[13]. Moving along circumference of such a beam cross section one faces varying optical
phase covered by the path (or line integral of azimuthal phase), which can be expressed
with a factor exp (imφ) in its amplitude expression [7,13,14], where m is azimuthal
quantum number. Moreover, as we can see from Kirchhoﬀ integral that the factor A1f i
lies outside the integral and we keep it as constant factor for integration. However,

considering exp

factor of A1f i we can say that with r′ =

So the doughnut beam acquires both azimuthal [13] as well as radial phase
distribution. To observe such a characteristic nature of the wavefront we performed
interference of the doughnut beam with its self image. Figure 6(a) shows schematic
diagram of such experimental setup. A 2.5 mm thick parallel face plane glass slide has
been chosen for creating such a self image and interference by division of amplitude.
As we can not modify separation of the faces of the glass slide so we adopt to change
incidence angle (by several milli-radian) of the beam by rotating the slide in a vertical
axis. At this stage we are not going to have quantitative analysis, so we will not
discuss precise value of this angle and corresponding change in interference pattern.
Thus a qualitative estimation will be suﬃcient for the discussion that follows.

It may be noted that the radial phase distribution that arises within Kirchhoﬀ
integral is inherent to each of the two beams. Thus it is independent of this doughnut
beam generation and will remain present in all beam modes of ﬁgure 3. Now we try
to establish the fact experimentally that such phase distribution indeed is present in

the resulting beams described above. Both transmitted beam and reﬂected beams of
ﬁgure 6(a) have been recorded simultaneously, as shown in ﬁgure 6(b) - 6(f).

In ﬁgure 6(b)-6(f) we see that interference dark lines, arising due to parallel
surface slide glass is linear in some part while non-linear at some other. Linear dark
fringes arise when optical phase relationship between the two beams is linear, and
similarly non-linear dark line correspond to non-linear phase relation. Due to helical
wavefront and radial phase distribution, it is possible in the experiment of ﬁg 6(a)
that phase of a part of wavefront becomes linearly related while the other turns out to
be non-linearly related. Thus, while incidence angle is changed (in milli-radian range)
from 6(b) to 6(f), a transition from linear to non-linear dark fringe takes place.

The transmitted part of the beam, going through the glass slide, does not
show repetition of such pattern because of intensity mismatch of component beams.
Furthermore, the azimuthal phase distribution is also demonstrated in ﬁgure 6(g),
which shows only one ’spoke’ [13] of the interference image that corresponds to helicity
m = 1
2 .

5. Discussion

We see that the approximated analytical expression of the resultant beam of
interference is followed by the experiments performed, however the eﬀect of radial
phase and azimuthal phase distribution that we did not take into account at doughnut
beam formation stage, and it becomes evident through later part of experiment. In
ﬁgure 2, 3 we see that the dark core of the doughnut beam does not arise only when
condition θ = (4n + 1) π/4 is fulﬁlled, rather it tends to prevail through a range of
delay. It may be due to radial as well as azimuthal and Gouy phase distribution of the
two interfering beams dominate in such a zone which results in slow transformation
of the dark axial region to bright zone.

In case of evanescent ﬁeld and its role on atom reﬂection we looked into three

D

possible mechanisms of atom photon interaction among these the dipole force and
retardation eﬀect of the optical near-ﬁeld are polarization dependent while the
scattering force does not depend on beam polarization. In addition dipole force is
weaker than scattering force. Therefore, if we extend the analysis a bit further, it may
be possible that the scattering force and the retardation eﬀect have greater role to
play in atom guidance of cold atoms through dark core laser beam.

Van der Waals force is the force in atomic range eﬀective among atoms. When Rb
atom comes closer to the glass wall its electric multipole moment and that of the glass
surface will be responsible to generate such attractive force. The electric multipole
moment will depend on atomic state, e.g.
in the ground state the moment will be
lower than that at excited state. However atom in the excited state while enter the
evanescent region may subject to emit a photon in presence of dipole force ﬁeld and
get de-excited. As a result the atom may face a varying strength of Van der Walls
force. However under the condition when Van der Waals force is weaker than dipole
force and dipole force weaker than scattering force, the eﬀect of such a localized and
instantaneous eﬀects may not have major eﬀect in atom reﬂection in the atom funnel.
To transport cold atoms through its dark core it is necessary to have a suitable
handle so that preferential force on such atom can be applied. A very weak but non-
zero axial optical intensity proﬁle can provide such a force through scattering. This in
combination with radial optical potential ﬁeld of the doughnut beam may transport
and manipulate cold atoms more eﬃciently.

6. Conclusions

Thus, we have generated tunable and stabilized doughnut beam through interference
in a modiﬁed Michael interferometer. The optical power is suﬃcient to reﬂect cold
Rb atoms, at around 10µK temperature. It has been observed that such a beam have
radial as well as azimuthal phase distribution and helicity as 1
2 . Out of various modes
that available in this method, a doughnut mode have beam waist of 2.5 mm and dark
diameter more than 250µ.

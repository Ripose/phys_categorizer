First-order strong ﬁeld approximation for high-order harmonic generation

Ariel Gordon∗ and Franz X. K¨artner
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139

Recently it was shown [A. Gordon and F. X. K¨artner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 223901 (2005)] that
the strong ﬁeld approximation (SFA) for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) is signiﬁcantly
improved when the SFA wave function is used with the acceleration rather than the length form of
the dipole operator. In this work it is shown that using the acceleration form upgrades the SFA
from zeroth-order to ﬁrst-order accuracy in the binding potential. The ﬁrst-order correct three-step
model (1st-order TSM) obtained thereby is systematically compared to its standard zeroth-order
counterpart (0th-order TSM) and it is found that they diﬀer signiﬁcantly even for energetic electrons.
For molecules (in the single-electron approximation), the 0th-order and the 1st-order TSMs in general
disagree about the connection between the orbital symmetry and the positions of the minima in the
HHG spectrum. At last, we brieﬂy comment on gauge and translation invariance issues of the SFA.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The strong ﬁeld approximation (SFA) [1, 2, 3] is a
key technique in the study of interactions of matter with
intense laser ﬁelds.
In particular, the SFA is used to
describe high-order harmonic generation (HHG) [4, 5, 6,
7]. The three-step model (TSM) [5, 6, 7], which is based
on the SFA, has proven very successful describing much of
the experimental behavior. The best known examples are
the cutoﬀ formula [5, 6, 7] and time-frequency structure
of the HHG signal [8], which led to the prediction of
attosecond pulses [9]. Reviews can be found in Refs. [10,
11].

It has been long known however that the TSM is incor-
rect by 1-2 orders of magnitude predicting the spectral
intensity of HHG in atomic hydrogen, as found from com-
parisons with numerically-exact results [11, 12]. For the
H+
2 ion the TSM gives a spectrum which is many orders
of magnitude away from numerically-exact results [13],
and the shape of the spectrum can be heavily distorted
[13, 14].

HHG experiments are now coming to the point where
more accurate theory is needed. The race towards har-
nessing HHG for a coherent short wavelength source
[15, 16, 17] can beneﬁt from quantitative theoretical esti-
mates of the HHG eﬃciency, which to date are very scarce
[18]. The recent orbital imaging experiment [19] uses the
HHG spectrum to infer the structure of a molecular or-
bital, which also requires quantitatively reliable theory,
capable of giving a precise description of the shape of the
HHG spectrum.

In a recent theoretical work [13] we proposed a modi-
ﬁed version of the TSM, where the SFA wavefunction is
used with the dipole operator in the acceleration rather
than the length form. Comparison of the TSM with a
numerical solution of the time dependent Schr¨odinger

∗Electronic address: gariel@mit.edu

equation (TDSE) then demonstrated excellent quanti-
tative agreement for atomic hydrogen, and signiﬁcantly
improved agreement for the H+
2 ion. The argument why
using the acceleration form improves the TSM so much
was that the TSM then becomes correct to ﬁrst order
in the binding potential (we shall henceforth refer to the
TSM obtained this way as 1st-order TSM), whereas the
standard TSM [5, 6, 7] (0th-order TSM) is correct to ze-
roth order in the binding potential.

This work is a followup on Ref. [13], and it has three
goals. First, the ﬁrst-order accuracy of the 1st-order TSM
is established. Second, a detailed and general comparison
between the 1st-order TSM and the 0th-order TSM is
given.
It is shown that the two always disagree with
respect to the connection between the orbital symmetry
and the positions of the minima in the HHG spectrum,
as demonstrated for H+
2 [13, 14]. Third, the opportunity
of re-deriving the SFA is used to give a perspective on
some delicate issues in the derivation, such as gauge and
translation invariance, which have been under debate [20,
21, 22, 23, 24].

This paper is organized as follows. In Sections II and
III the derivation of the SFA and 0th-order TSM is re-
viewed, in an attempt to illuminate some subtleties in
the derivation and in order to set the stage for deriving
the 1st-order TSM in Sec. IV. Section V compares the
0th-order and 1st-order TSMs, and Sec. VI is dedicated to
the discussion of gauge and translation invariance issues
in the SFA. Section VII gives a brief summary.

Atomic units are adopted throughout the paper.

II. STRONG FIELD APPROXIMATION

This work is restricted to the single-electron approxi-
mation, where an atom or a molecule are modeled by an
electron in an eﬀective (local) potential V (r):

H0 =

+ V (r) + Ip,

(1)

2
∇
2

−

Ip is the binding energy of the ground state, and is added
to Eq. (1) for convenience reasons, such that the ground
state of H0 has zero energy. The atom or molecule is
placed in a linearly polarized electric ﬁeld E(t). The
x axis is chosen along the direction of polarization, the
wavelength is assumed suﬃciently long such that the
dipole approximation holds, and the length gauge is cho-
sen, to give the Hamiltonian

H(t) = H0 −

E(t)x.

(2)

The SFA is usually presented [see, e. g. Ref. [10] and
references therein] as a perturbative expansion in V (r),
where the unperturbed Hamiltonian is the Volkov Hamil-
tonian

HV (t) =

E(t)x + Ip.

The evolution operator UV (t, t′) of HV (t), deﬁned by

i∂tUV (t, t′) = HV (t)UV (t, t′); UV (t′, t′) = 1,

(4)

is known exactly [6]. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger
equation one can approximate U (t, t′), the evolution op-
erator associated with H(t) (deﬁned through Eq. (4) with
all V subscripts omitted) to arbitrary order in V (r) [25].
The zeroth and ﬁrst order would be

U0(t, t′) = UV (t, t′)

U1(t, t′) =

One therefore could suggest approximating U (t, t′) in
Eq. (7) by the perturbative expansion outlined in Eqs. (5,

formed. The route is rather by making the ansatz [6]

Let us assume for the moment that a(t) is speciﬁed. The
SFA approximates U in Eq. (10) by a perturbation series
in V upon UV .

One can now ask why the SFA approximates U in
Eq. (10) rather than in Eq. (7), if both lead to an exact
wavefunction when U is exact? In other words, why one
needs the ansatz (8) and the rather non-straightforward
Eq. (9)? To our understanding, the answer to these ques-
tions is that the perturbed UV (t, t′) is a very bad ap-
proximation for describing the evolution of (quasi) bound
states.

Without the laser ﬁeld, perturbation theory for the
evolution operator (the Born series) diverges at bound
states of the full Hamiltonian [26]. The presence of a laser
ﬁeld may change the situation, since formally there are
no bound states at all. We are not in a position to make a
rigorous mathematical statement about the convergence
of the SFA, but since the ground state remains quasi-
bound, one may expect convergence diﬃculties. Obvi-
ously, at least for the the zeroth order theory, UV (t, t′)
itself gives a very bad approximation for the evolution of
a quasi-bound state. In fact, in the Keldysh ionization
rate [1] is found rather indirectly, by calculating the rate
at which the norm of the continuum increases, and the
rate at which the ground-state decays is inferred solely
by conservation of the total norm.

The last term in Eq. (9) is therefore added because we
know in advance that we are going to use an approximate
propagator, which will give a very bad description for the
evolution of the ground state. Yet, Eq. (9) provides a
clear route for systematically improving the SFA: a(t) is
ﬁrst assumed to be known, and Eq. (9) is solved to in
principle an arbitrary order in V (r). Then a(t) is found
by demanding the conservation of norm, or by means of
other approximations, as the perturbed UV (t, t′) alone is
not well suited for this purpose. Note that in the limit
where U is exact, one easily ﬁnds from Eq. (9) and Eq. (8)
that a(t)

III. ZEROTH ORDER TSM

In this section we re-derive the standard 0th-order
TSM. The main reason is that our slightly diﬀerent
derivation lays the technical foundations for establishing
the ﬁrst order accuracy of the 1st-order TSM in Sec. IV.
The 0th-order TSM is obtained by simply replacing
U (t, t′) by UV (t, t′) in Eq. (9). Since UV (t, t′) is known
exactly, the solution can be written in a closed form [6]:

At this point we slightly deviate from the standard
derivation of the TSM [6, 7]: We perform the saddle-
point integration in Eq. (11) right now, before proceed-
ing. This calculation was pioneered by Keldysh [1] and
is further discussed in a vast number of SFA studies [see
e. g. Ref. [27] and references therein]. The discussion
in this work is limited to the tunneling regime, which is
deﬁned by the requirements [27]:

In Eq. (13a) E0 is the amplitude of the driving ﬁeld and
ω is its frequency. These parameters are precisely de-
ﬁned for a sinusoidal driving ﬁeld, and more loosely for a
general ﬁeld, such as a sinusoidal ﬁeld with an envelope.
In the latter case, ω can be thought of as the parameter
characterizing the timescale over which E(t) varies. γ
is the well known Keldysh parameter [1]. Note that the
requirement (13c) follows from (13a) and (13b).

between two diﬀerent Volkov states vanish. The high
harmonics come from the cross term ξ0(t). Using Eq. (14)

Eq. (21) is identical to the original TSM expression de-
rived in Ref. [7]. The only diﬀerence is that Eq. (21) takes
into account the depletion of the ground state, and that
all numerical prefactors (23/2π) were calculated. The re-
derivation of the 0th-order TSM is now concluded.

IV. FIRST ORDER TSM

A straight forward way to upgrade the TSM from ze-
roth to ﬁrst order accuracy in V would be improving the
TSM wavefunction (11) by adding the ﬁrst-order correc-
tion to the evolution operator, Eq. (6). This method has
been employed in Ref. [29], for improving the SFA the-
oretical description of above threshold ionization. For
HHG we propose another method, which is signiﬁcantly
simpler, and does not require correcting the wavefunc-
tion.
If

is the exact solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation with the Hamiltonian (2), then the
Ehrenfest theorem holds:

Therefore computing the time-dependent dipole expec-
tation value in all three forms of Eq. (22), length (22a),
velocity (22b), or acceleration (22c), is equivalent if ac-
companied by the appropriate diﬀerentiation or integra-
tion in time.

However with the approximate wavefunction given by
Eqs. (8) and (14), the results will be in general diﬀerent
for each form. One therefore has to make a choice which
form to use for this particular wavefunction. We argue
that the acceleration form gives in general the best re-
sults, since even if
is only correct to zeroth order
in V (r), the expectation value is automatically correct,
at least formally, to ﬁrst order in V (r). One therefore
needs to evaluate

The last term of Eq. (22c) has been dropped, since it is
the driving ﬁeld itself and thus contains no harmonics.
It is easy to show, exploiting the commutator [p, H0],
that

origin], which is why the corresponding term in Eq. (23)
is missing.

Note that the mere appearance of V in Eq. (23) is
not suﬃcient to warrant ﬁrst order accuracy. One can
see that, for example, from the fact that zeroth order
SFA expressions in V can be transformed such that they
appear linear or quadratic in V [30, 31]. The (formal)
ﬁrst-order accuracy of Eq. (23) is established by the fact
that a ﬁrst-order correction in V to the wavefunction in
Eq. (11) will result in only a second order correction in V
in Eq. (23). This is why we dedicated Sec. II to carefully
deﬁning the procedure by which the SFA is corrected
order by order in V .

The cross term ¨ξ1 has the same structure as ξ0
[Eq. (18)]. Going through the same steps that have led
to Eq. (21), one arrives at the same expression ¨ξ1, with
the only diﬀerence that the matrix element

Eq. (26) is the improved version of the TSM presented
in Ref. [13]. The change in the expression compared to
Eq. (21) is very small and easy to implement, and yet
results in a very large diﬀerence, especially in the case of
molecules.

Eq. (26) is an expression for ¨ξ1, but Eq. (23) contains
also ξc. It turns out that the contribution of ¨ξc to HHG is

4

(27)

(28)

smaller by at least O(ω3/2) than that of ¨ξ1. ¨ξc is therefore
negligible for ω
1, which coincides with Eq. (13c) when
Ip is of O(1). The latter holds for all neutral (or not
highly charged) atoms and molecules. The evaluation of
¨ξc is rather lengthy, especially for potentials with a long-
ranged Coulomb tail, and is given in Appendix B.

-ORDER TSM – COMPARISON

The 0th-order TSM suggests Eq. (18) as an approxima-
tion to the dipole moment, whereas the 1st-order TSM
suggests Eq. (24).
In order to compare them conve-
niently, we now diﬀerentiate Eq. (18) twice in time and
compare ¨ξ0 with ¨ξ1. This is done in detail in Appendix
C. The result is that under the condition (13a), in or-
der to obtain ¨ξ0(t), one has to replace the 1st-order TSM

We now assume that V (r) is an eﬀective potential that
represents a molecule (or, as a special case, an atom) with
nuclei at positions rj with charges Zj, j = 1...N . Com-
mon choices for an eﬀective potential to model such a
system have a Zj/
singularity near the j-th nu-
cleus, which is partially screened oﬀ away from the nu-
cleus. Then the last term in Eq. (32) can be written as

Now one has to distinguish two cases. The ﬁrst case is

Eq. (33) does not vanish [apart from possibly a very few

the most singular one among all terms on the right hand

C. Molecules

The diﬀerences between the 0th-order TSM and the 1st-
order TSM for molecules is particularly striking. The two
models give opposite relations between orbital symmetry
and the positions of the minima in the HHG spectrum,
a subject of many recent theoretical and experimental
studies [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. A set of minima
is predicted by the 0th-order TSM with an odd orbital,
corresponds to an even orbital in the 1st-order TSM, and
vice versa.

Observing Eq. (39) and Eq. (40), it becomes clear why
the 0th-order TSM and 1st-order TSM disagree about the
connection between the symmetry ψ0 and the zeros (or

the zeros, Eq. (40) is the Fourier transform of xψ0(r),
whereas Eq. (39) is the Fourier transform of ψ0(r) (both

viously have the opposite symmetry with respect to a

The 0th-order TSM therefore predicts minima at energies
given by Ip + (2πn/R)2 (n is an integer), whereas the

x, the cosine [sine] in Eq. (41) [Eq. (42)] is re-
placed by a sine [cosine]. Therefore if the 0th-order TSM
is used for reconstructing ψ0(r) from the HHG spectrum,
it ﬂips the symmetry of ψ0(r) from even to odd and vice
versa. This statement is, of course, based only on the
asymptotic behavior of the arec-s. Yet it is

VI. GAUGE AND TRANSLATION
INVARIANCE ISSUES

The dependence of the SFA on gauge has been the
subject of lively discussions [3, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Here
we do not attempt a comprehensive discussion of this
subject. However since some steps in Sec. V seem to rely
on placing the origin of the laser potential and the atom
at the same point, we brieﬂy address the related issue of
translation invariance.

Consider thus the Hamiltonian

H(t) =

2 + V (r)

1
2 ∇

−

E(t)(x

x0) + Ip

(43)

−

−

(x0 is a constant), which is related to Eq. (2) by a gauge
transformation. The exact solution of the TDSE with
Eq. (43) obviously gives the same time-dependent expec-
tation values as with Eq. (2). However the SFA can give
diﬀerent results for Eq. (43) and Eq. (2). In particular,
the SFA with Eq. (43) can give rise to the generation of
even harmonics [21], which is an artifact.

There is an obvious way by which this problem can be

cured, namely, by replacing the ansatz (8) by

(44)

Substituted Eq. (44) into the TDSE with the Hamilto-
nian (43), it is easy to convince oneself that the results
no longer depend on x0. This is because wavefunction
(8) undergoes exactly the gauge transformation that con-
nects Eq. (43) to Eq. (2), guaranteeing gauge invariance.
The SFA depends on the choice of gauge simply because
it crucially depends on the choice of the initial ansatz.

One can now ask how to obtain an ansatz for a given
gauge a-priori, without e. g. gauge-transforming Eq. (8),
and how to obtain the ansatz (8) itself a-priori. Our an-
swer is that the ansatz should provide the best approxi-
mation for the evolution of the quasi-bound ground state,
since the (perturbed) Volkov evolution operator cannot
do it [see Sec. II].

In the low frequency regime [Eq. (13c)], a good ap-
proximation for the evolution of the ground state can
be found using the adiabatic theorem [41]: It is approx-
imately given by e−

The discussion can be extended to at least one common
gauge, namely the velocity gauge. Then the adiabatic ar-
gument would again give a modiﬁed ansatz, similar to the

one used in Ref. [43]. It is likely that the diﬀerences be-
tween the length and velocity gauges reported in Ref. [23]
would then disappear.

VII. DISCUSSION

The large discrepancy between the 0th-order TSM
HHG spectra and numerically-exact calculations has
been attributed long ago [11] to the SFA wavefunction
being inaccurate. It is often argued that this SFA wave-
function is especially inaccurate for molecules [45]. This
work strongly supports these ideas: The length and ac-
celeration forms of the dipole operator used on the same
SFA wavefunction are shown to give dramatically diﬀer-
ent results, especially for molecules. For an exact wave-
function the results would be identical, and thus the large
discrepancy is evidence for the inaccuracy of the wave-
function.

Since the wavefunction is so far from being exact, it
is especially important to use it properly. In this work
we have argued that together with the acceleration form
of the dipole, the zeroth-order SFA wavefunction leads
to an approximation (the 1st-order TSM) with ﬁrst-order
overall accuracy in the binding potential. Since the wave-
function itself is so inaccurate, it can lead to very large
errors if used otherwise than in the specially-suited way
introduced in this work. The accuracy of the 1st-order
TSM should be tested in terms of the expectation values
it generates and not in terms of the wavefunction itself.
We have shown that the continuum-continuum term in
the 1st-order TSM is negligible compared to the bound-
continuum term. Therefore, the widely-used 0th-order
TSM is upgraded to ﬁrst-order accuracy by simply re-
placing x by ∂xV (r) in the recombination amplitude,
which is simple to implement. The 1st-order TSM shows
excellent agreement with numerically-exact results for
atoms [13, 46] and good agreement for H+

2 [13].

The SFA decomposes the wavefunction into a contin-
uum, and a quasi-bound ground state. This is justiﬁed,
since the strong laser ﬁeld smears the excited states of the
unperturbed system and turns them into a continuum [6].
The dynamics of the continuum is approximated by the
Volkov propagator, which can be corrected order by order
in the binding potential. The quasi-bound state however
should be treated separately.

It should be noted that there could be more than one
quasi-bound state. For example, the initial state of the
electron can be an excited state of the laser-free Hamil-
tonian H0, a case that was not treated in this work. This
is commonly the case in single-electron models of multi-
electron atoms. Then the states lying energetically be-
low the initial state are also quasi-bound, and should
also be treated separately. One simple way to do that is
to project these states out of the SFA wavefunction, as
brieﬂy discussed at the end of Ref. [46].

APPENDIX A: COMPLEMENTARY REMARKS
ON THE DERIVATION OF THE 0th-ORDER TSM

Eq. (20) is gives the stationary phase condition only
to leading order in γ. In fact, when S(p, t, tn(px)) is dif-
ferentiated with respect px taking Eq. (15) into account,
the result is

Ip
E(tn)

t

Ztn

+

(A(tn)

A(t′′))dt′′ = 0.

(A1)

−

The second term in Eq. (A1) is of the order of E0/ω2,
while the ﬁrst one is of the order of Ip/E0. Therefore
the ﬁrst term in Eq. (A1) is a second-order correction in
γ to Eq. (20). It is interesting to note however that the
subleading term term is meaningful, since the electron is
released by tunneling roughly at the turning point (x =
Ip/E) [27] rather than at the origin.
Note that the denominator (t

tn(t))3/2 in Eq. (21)
cannot result in a divergence. If the ﬁrst term in Eq. (20)
is retained, the reason is obvious – the duration of a tra-
jectory is never zero, since it begins and ends at diﬀerent
locations. If the ﬁrst term in Eq. (20) is neglected, as
often happens, one can easily show that trajectories for
which t approaches tn(t) can only occur at points where
E(t) = 0, and then w(E) vanishes exponentially. Per-
forming the t′ integration ﬁrst thus spares the need for
the regularizing parameter ǫ used in, e. g. Ref. [6].

I represents the third line of Eq. (B3), and the rest of
the integrand is slowly varying and can be added later.
Eq. (B6) has two oscillating phase factors, centered at
p0 and p′0, and the Coulomb potential. τ and τ ′ are
real and positive, and by comparison with Eq. (B3) one
can see that they represent the traveling times of the two
trajectories.

Eq. (B6) is transformed to

We now carry out the integration in Eq. (B3) in the

that apart from the exponentials in Eq. (B3), the rest of

use the short-range property of V , which assures that Q

it is O(ω3). Moreover, ξ1(t) is proportional to

cally operate under the condition of small ionization per

is formally of the same order in V (r) as ¨ξ1(t), ¨ξc(t) is
more than O(ω2) smaller than ¨ξ1(t), and is thus negligi-
ble under the conditions (13).

It should be noted that since ξ1(t) is proportional to
a∗(t), at very high ﬁelds, where the ground state is almost
completely ionized in one cycle, ξ1(t) becomes exponen-
tially small in the ﬁeld amplitude [44]. In this case ¨ξc(t)
may become signiﬁcant. However this regime is of little
interest form the point of view of HHG, since HHG ba-
sically disappears under these operating conditions [44].

The discussion in Sec. B 1 therefore holds as it is as long
as the condition 1/τ, 1/τ ′
0 is met. This condition

is violated when ∆p0 approaches zero, and this case will
be our concern in what follows. By observing Eq. (B4)
one can see that the latter always happens when n = n′,

with the second case.

We start with having another look at Eq. (B4). For a

Note that we are considering two diﬀerent trajectories,

that two diﬀerent trajectories that return at the same

therefore that Eq. (B11) is O(ω5/2).
For two diﬀerent trajectories, n

singularity therefore enhances the integral Eq. (B3) by
1/2. This is seen by comparing
at most a factor of ω−
Eq. (B7) and Eq. (B11). In Sec. B 1 we have shown that
¨ξc(t) is smaller than ¨ξ1(t) by a factor of O(ω2). Now we
arrive at the conclusion that in the long range case, for
two diﬀerent trajectories, ¨ξc(t) can be sometimes smaller
than ξ1(t) by factor of O(ω3/2) only. Yet, ¨ξc(t) remains
negligible for ω

Eq. (B12) has a simple intuitive meaning. ¨ξ1(t) gives the
beat frequency between the ground state (at frequency
Ip) and a continuum electron with a frequency corre-
sponding to the kinetic energy upon return. In contrast,
¨ξc(t) is obtained from two diﬀerent electron trajectories,
which return to the parent ion at the same time with
two diﬀerent kinetic energies. The emitted radiation is
at the beat frequency corresponding to the diﬀerence in
the kinetic energies upon return.

Obviously, if n = n′, that is, if the two trajectories orig-
inated at the same birth time, they are identical. There-
fore the beat frequency is zero and no high harmonics
are generated. In other words, for n = n′ Eq. (B3) varies
slowly in time. There is yet a subtle point to be checked:
loosely speaking, if Eq. (B3) is very large, then even if it
varies very slowly in time, its high-frequency tail may be
comparable to ¨ξ1(t).

In order to show that this is not the case, we introduce
an infrared cutoﬀ to the Coulomb potential, replacing
r/r0/r. After
it by the Yukawa potential V (r) =

Our statement, that the continuum-continuum term ¨ξc(t)

far as HHG is concerned, is now established.

Of the terms on the right hand side of Eq. (C3), we ar-
gue that the ﬁrst one is the most dominant in the regime
deﬁned by Eq. (13a). In order to show this we note that

an exponential falloﬀ at the rate of

rives at the conclusion that the second term is negligible
compared to the ﬁrst one. Using similar argumentation
and using Eq. (13a) one shows that the ﬁrst term on the
right hand side of Eq. (C3) is indeed the dominant one.
Eq. (28) is thus established.

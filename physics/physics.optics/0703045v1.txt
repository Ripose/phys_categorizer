We have measured the evolution of the light intensity of a random laser during a nanosecond
pump pulse. Relaxation oscillations in a titania random laser were observed in the time trace of the
total emitted intensity. We compare our experimental results with a simple model, based on the
four-level rate equations for a single mode laser.

INTRODUCTION

Relaxation oscillations of conventional lasers are a well-
understood phenomenon.[1] They are especially impor-
tant for continuous wave and long-pulsed lasers. In a ran-
dom laser, a medium in which gain is combined with mul-
tiple scattering of light, relaxation oscillations can also
occur, as was predicted by Letokhov in 1968.[2] A pre-
eminent experimental demonstration of a random laser
was published by Lawandy et al.
in 1994 [3], followed
by many others [4, 5, 6, 7]. Only recently Soukoulis and
coauthors have presented measurements of relaxation os-
cillations in single modes of a picosecond pumped random
laser system.[8] Diﬀerent numerical calculations on ran-
dom lasers also show this oscillatory behavior.[9, 10, 11]
To our knowledge, no measurements have been per-
formed on relaxation oscillations in random lasers in the
interesting regime of long pulses.

In this report we present measurements of the time
evolution of a nanosecond pumped random laser system.
We compare our experimental observations with a simple
model, based on the four-level rate equations for a single-
mode laser.

II. A SIMPLE MODEL

The evolution of the excited molecules N1 and the
number of photons q in a laser are described by the well-
known four-level rate equations [1]

where P is the pumping ﬂuence that is absorbed by the
molecules inside the cavity, τc the cavity decay time, τ

of the laser. The beta factor is deﬁned as the amount
of spontaneous emission that contributes to the lasing
mode, and can also be determined for a random laser [12].
From these rate equations Woerdman and coauthors
have derived an equation for the frequency of the re-
laxation oscillations explicitly including the spontaneous
emission:[13]

where ωres is the relaxation oscillations frequency, and
M the scaled pump ﬂuence, deﬁned as the ratio of the
absorbed ﬂuence P and the threshold ﬂuence Pth.

(cid:21)

We apply this model to the multi-mode pulsed random
laser by simply changing β to βmm and τc to τc,mm, i.e.
we use a mean cavity decay time and a mean beta factor
to describe our multi-mode random laser. This simpli-
ﬁcation accurately describes the threshold behavior of
random lasers [14].

III. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

The random laser used in our experiments consists of a
suspension of TiO2 particles (mean diameter of 180 nm,
volume fraction of 10%) in a solution of Sulforhodamine
B in methanol (1 mmol/liter; pump absorption length,
104 µm; minimal gain length, 83 µm [15]). The suspen-
sion is contained in a fused silica capillary tube, with
internal dimensions 100 × 2 × 2 mm3. To measure the
mean free path of light in this sample, we performed an
enhanced-backscatter cone experiment [16] and an escape
function experiment [17]. We found a transport mean
free path of 0.46 ± 0.1 µm at 633 nm (eﬀective refractive
index, 1.48±0.04).

The samples were excited by a pump pulse at 532 nm,
provided by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO)
pumped by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Coherent In-
ﬁnity 40-100/XPO). The pump pulse had a duration
of 3 ns and a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The pump
light was focused with a microscope objective (water-
immersed, numerical aperture NA, 1.2) onto the sample

(focus area, 12 ± 6 µm2), reaching an intensity in the or-
der of 1 mJ/mm2. The central wavelength of the emitted
light is 594 nm [14], and the narrowing factor (deﬁned as
the spectral width of the emitted light far above thresh-
old divided by the spectral width far below threshold)
is 8. The light emitted by the random laser was col-
lected by the same microscope objective. The emitted
light was detected by a 25 GHz photodiode (New Focus
1404), read out by an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 7404,
analog bandwidth, 4 GHz). The resulting time resolution
was 100 ps. To obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio, the
data shown is an average of 100 oversampled time traces.
The pump light was ﬁltered out of the detection path
by use of a colored glass ﬁlter with an optical density of
more than 4 at the wavelength of the pump laser.

IV. MEASURED RELAXATION
OSCILLATIONS

The normalized time trace of the pump pulse and the
normalized time trace of the total emitted light from the
random laser far above threshold are shown in Fig. 1.
Overall, the duration of the pump laser pulse is longer
than the duration of the pulse of light the random laser
emits. We see in the pulse emitted by the random laser
ﬁrst a fast decay, followed by a slower exponential de-
cay. The fast decay is due to the stimulated emission
In the second part of the decay
in the random laser.
the population inversion is no longer present, and the
spontaneous emission causes a slower decay of intensity.
These observations are in agreement with other random
laser experiments.[8] In Fig. 1 relaxation oscillations in
the emitted light are clearly visible near the peak inten-
sity.

We measured the time evolution for diﬀerent input
ﬂuences.
In Fig. 2 the normalized intensity is plotted
versus time for four diﬀerent pump ﬂuences [18]. The
time traces are shifted vertically with respect to each
other for clarity. The time trace at a pump ﬂuence of
0.06 mJ/mm2 is below threshold, while the time traces
with higher pump ﬂuences are above threshold. We ob-
serve that relaxation oscillations occur above threshold
and become more pronounced when the pump ﬂuence
increases.

The frequency of the relaxation oscillations are com-
puted from the time traces. We determine the times at
which the intensity is at a local maximum. The diﬀer-
ence of two consecutive local maxima ∆t is the period,
and the frequency of the relaxation oscillation νrel is given
by 1/(∆t).

V. COMPARISON OF THE MEASUREMENTS
WITH THE MODEL

FIG. 1: Measured time traces of the pump pulse (gray)
and emission output above threshold (black, input ﬂuence
= 0.47 mJ/mm2) of a titania random laser. The pump pulse
duration is much longer than the duration of the emitted light
of the random laser above threshold. Relaxation oscillations
in the emitted light are clearly visible near the peak intensity.
The decay time of the emitted light is ﬁrst dominated by stim-
ulated emission. In the second part of the decay-curve, the
spontaneous emission is dominating.

Fig. 3 the measured relaxation oscillations frequencies
are plotted versus the scaled pump ﬂuence M . The
relaxation-oscillation frequency signiﬁcantly decreases
when the scaled pump ﬂuence increases from 1 to 2. A
further increase of the scaled pump ﬂuence does not sig-
niﬁcantly change the frequency of the relaxation oscil-
lations. The result of Eq. (2) is depicted for diﬀerent
cavity decay times. This cavity decay time is the only
parameter that could not be directly determined by our
experiment. The trend of the model for a ﬁxed cavity
decay time is that, in contrast to our measurements, the
relaxation-oscillations frequency increases for increasing
pump ﬂuence. Only for large (> 3) normalized pump ﬂu-
ence the ﬁt of the model for a cavity decay time of 5 ps
ﬁts reasonably.

The diﬀerence in the observed trend of the relaxation-
oscillation frequency between the simple model and our
experiments, is probably due to the size of the gain vol-
ume: The gain inside the gain volume of the random
laser saturates at threshold [14]. A further increase of
the pump ﬂuence will lead immediately to a larger gain
volume, and a corresponding longer cavity decay time.
Apparently, this behavior saturates above a scaled pump
ﬂuence of 3.

We have used the distribution of the phase-delay time
to determine the mean cavity decay time τc, given by [14]

We have inferred the relaxation oscillation frequency
for diﬀerent pump ﬂuences from our measurements. In

non-resonant scattering, the diﬀusion constant D =
c0ℓ/(3n′), where c0 is the speed of light in vacuum, ℓ
the transport mean free path and n′ is the real part of
the eﬀective refractive index of the medium. For our ti-
tania random laser we ﬁnd a τc in the order of 10−13 s, in
contrast to 10−12 s that is suggested by the agreement in
Fig. 3 at M = 3. The diﬀerence between the two cavity
decay times is a factor 10. This deviation could origi-
nate in part from the diﬀerence between the mean cavity
decay time τc of all modes and the mean cavity decay
time of the lasing modes: Our experiment suggests that
random lasing preferentially takes place in modes with a
much longer than average cavity decay time.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have seen relaxation oscillations in our random
laser, while looking at the time evolution of the total
emitted light for diﬀerent realizations of the sample. Mul-
tiple modes contributed to these time traces, and we av-
eraged the time traces over several realizations of disorder
of our random laser sample. The resulting time trace still
showed relaxation oscillations: a weighted average of the
oscillations of all the underlying modes.

The measured relaxation oscillations were compared
with a simple model, based on a single-mode continuous-
wave laser system. The observed trend of our experi-
ments diﬀers from the expected trend, due to the increase
of the gain volume and the corresponding cavity decay
time for an increase of the scaled pump ﬂuence. The cav-
ity decay time determined with the ﬁt from the simple

The ﬁt of the model for a cavity decay time of 5 ps ﬁts reason-
ably for high pump ﬂuences, but corresponds to a surprisingly
large value of τ .

model is a factor 10 higher than the mean cavity decay
time of our sample. Our experiment suggests that the
modes contributing to random laser emission have a cav-
ity decay time much longer than the average cavity decay
time.

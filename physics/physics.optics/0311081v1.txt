In positive phase-mismatched SHG and normal dispersion, a gaussian spatio-temporal pulse trans-
forms spontaneously into a X-pulse, underlies spatio-temporal compression and eventually leads to
stationary 3-D propagation. Experimental and numerical data are provided.

PACS numbers: 42.65.Tg, 05.45.Yv, 42.65.Jx

X-pulses (the radial analogous of tilted pulses) are known from linear optics since they sustain propagation with
constant spatio-temporal proﬁle in normal dispersive media [1]. Here we show that X pulses are formed spontaneously
from a gaussian beam/pulse under SHG with positive mismatch (2kω > k2ω) and normal dispersion.

FIG. 1: Nonlinear dynamics. Numerical results

This transformation leads to the relevant dynamics presented by the numerical results in Figure 1. The achieved
spatio-temporal compression is a genuine eﬀect of the space-time interplay. In fact, self-focusing and time broadening
are expected for independent spatial and temporal dynamics. During compression the energy radiates out of the beam
center, as shown by the drop in the energy content (E = τ d2I, where τ and d are FWHM). After such transient the
pulse keeps an almost constant 25 fs duration (GVM splitting lenght=0.7mm, GVD dispersion length=6mm, for a
gaussian proﬁle). Spatially, a very small residual diﬀraction takes place, which let the state to relax slowly toward the
linear regime. Note here the constancy of the energy content (right), which proves that no radiation occurs neither
in time (due to GVM) nor in space (due to oﬀ-axis components). We veriﬁed that a small perturbation of the beam
shape introduces radiation losses. If we switch oﬀ the nonlinearity, than relevant beam diﬀraction and GVM pulse
splitting occurs. Outside the crystal, the pulse broadens due to eﬀective anomalous GVD. The scenario indicates
the occurrence of a novel process, which we might call ”nonlinear diﬀusion”, that keeps, at any ﬁnite intensity, exact
balance among the dispersions (at all orders) introduced by the material, the self-phase-modulation and the angular
dispersion. Asymptotic analysis is in progress to see if the ﬁeld eventually relax to the exact linear spatio-temporal
eigenmode of the double-frequency ﬁeld.

A preliminary experiment done in the same conditions veriﬁed the validity of the model. Figure 2 shows the

Preliminary calculations indicate that, in the absence of GVM, a periodical behavior occurs, consistently with the
existence of a X-type pulse with ﬁnite envelope (e. g. with ﬁnite energy), which propagate without any relaxation.
The intensity evolution of such a state is plotted as continuos line (no symbols) in Fig. 1. [2].

[2] Note: after publication of this paper, the Authors have discovered that the apparent occurrence of non-linear X-waves with
ﬁnite energy in the mentioned, GVM-free, regime was an artefact related to improper use of reﬂecting-boundary conditions
in the numerical calculations, owing to the presence of very weak but fairly extending wave-packet tails

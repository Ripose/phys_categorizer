Abstract. Current quantum cascade lasers based upon conduction band
electron transitions are predominantly TM (electrical ﬁeld normal to the epitaxial
direction) polarized. Here we present a study of localized defect modes, with
the requisite TM polarization, in connected square and hexagonal lattice two-
dimensional (2D) photonic crystals for application as quantum cascade laser
resonators. A simple group-theory based analysis is used to produce an
approximate description of the resonant modes supported by defects situated at
diﬀerent high symmetry points within the host photonic lattice. The results
of this analysis are compared with 2D ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD)
simulations, showing a close correspondence between the two analyses, and
potential applications of the analysis in quantum cascade laser design are
considered.

1. Introduction

Optical microcavities have been the subject of much research within a variety
of ﬁelds, including optoelectronics and laser physics[1], nonlinear optics[2], cavity
quantum electrodynamics[3], and biomolecular sensing[4]. Planar photonic crystal
(PC) defect microcavities[5, 6], formed by an intentionally introduced perturbation
to the periodic photonic lattice, have attracted attention for a variety of reasons,
including lithographic control of many salient properties of the cavity modes[6, 7],
the potential for on-chip integration with PC waveguides[8], and their ability to
support resonant modes that simultaneously exhibit ultra-small (wavelength-scale)
modal volumes and high quality factors[9, 10].
In most of these works, a two-
dimensional (2D) connected dielectric lattice of air holes is employed, often as a result
of experimental constraints (for example, a connected lattice is necessary for undercut
membrane geometries). The focus of these investigations has typically been on cavity
modes with transverse electric (TE) polarization (magnetic ﬁeld normal to the slab)
in a hexagonal lattice, primarily because of the presence of a complete (in-plane)
frequency band-gap for modes of such polarization[11]. Recent calculations[12, 13]
and experiments[10], however, have conﬁrmed that the absence of a complete in-plane
band-gap (in these cases, for TE modes within a connected square lattice of air holes)
does not preclude the formation of low-loss, localized resonant states, provided that the
modes are localized to regions of momentum space where the lattice provides strong

optical feedback. These results thus provide motivation for the study of localized
transverse magnetic (TM) polarized (electric ﬁeld normal to the slab) states within
connected photonic lattices, which also lack a complete in-plane band-gap.

Further encouragement is found in recent work incorporating a PC microcavity
within a quantum cascade (QC) semiconductor heterostructure[14] to form an
electrically-injected PC QC laser[15, 16]. The intersubband transitions responsible for
photon generation within QC lasers are fundamentally TM in nature, while eﬃcient
electrical injection necessitates the use of a connected PC lattice. Though initial
devices more employed more extended microcavity band-edge states, future eﬀorts will
involve optimization of current injection to create further localized electrically-driven
defect mode lasers, attractive due to the potential for reduced cavity radiation loss
(high quality factor) and further suppression of unwanted spontaneous emission. For
such applications, an understanding of the salient properties of the TM defect states
will be valuable.

Our study involves two complementary techniques for understanding the
properties of the TM-polarized defect states in square and hexagonal lattice 2D
PCs. The ﬁrst, detailed in Section 2, is a symmetry-based analysis analogous to that
considered in previous articles[6, 17] for TE-like modes, where the tools of group theory
are used to classify the symmetries and identify the dominant Fourier components of
the defect states. 2D ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the defect
modes are presented in Section 3, and show a close correspondence with the group
theory analysis, while complementing the results with a depiction of the real-space (in-
plane) properties of the modes. The results of these sections provide a starting point
from which more advanced defect designs can be generated, and a simple example of
this is given in Section 4.

2. Symmetry Analysis

The design of PC defect cavities has primarily been done through numerical methods
such as FDTD. The overriding role that symmetry plays in physical systems suggests
that the translational and rotational symmetries present in photonic lattices should
play a leading part in determining the properties of the defect modes, and as a
less numerically intensive methods can also provide valuable
result approximate,
information.
In recent work[6, 17], the methods of group theory were used to
analyze and classify the modes of 2D PC slab WG defect cavities for TE-like modes.
The results of the symmetry-based analysis were compared with FDTD simulations
and photoluminescence measurements, and showed a close correspondence between
the approximate analysis, the detailed numerical simulations, and the experimental
results. In this section, we extend the previously developed analysis to the case of
TM-like modes, with a focus on QC laser applications.

The discrete symmetries of the dielectric function, ǫ(r), determine the symmetries
present within Maxwell’s equations. The group theory analysis we consider consists
of two main steps. Modes of the unperturbed slab waveguide are used as a symmetry
basis to generate approximate ﬁeld patterns for the PC modes at the high symmetry
points within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (IBZ) of the reciprocal lattice. The curvature
of the photonic bands at these points are such that peaks and valleys are created in
the energy-momentum dispersion surface. It is these peaks and valleys which are the
seeds from which localized states are formed. The second step in our approach then
utilizes these PC band-edge states as a basis to generate approximate forms for the

localized defect modes lying within the (partial) band-gap.

We consider quasi-2D PC structures in this paper, where an eﬀective index (neﬀ)
for the fundamental TM mode is used to take into account vertical waveguiding. In this
quasi-2D system, the fundamental TM mode is represented by the scalar ﬁeld Ez; in
a true three dimensional (3D) PC slab WG system, modes can not be separated into
pure TE and TM polarizations, but are nevertheless (for the lower lying frequency
bands) signiﬁcantly TE-like or TM-like in character. As a result, the approximate
analysis presented here will have utility in studies of 3D systems as well (indeed, in
previous work[6, 17], the close correspondence between the symmetry-based analysis
and 3D FDTD results for TE-like modes was established).

2.1. Hexagonal Lattice

Figure 1. (a) Fundamental TM-like guided mode bandstructure (neﬀ = 3.345)
for a hexagonal photonic lattice with r/a=0.35. The air (cladding) light line
is shown as a solid black line. The X and J-point regions from which donor-like
defect modes are formed are circled. (b) Illustration of the (upper) real and (lower)
reciprocal spaces of the two-dimensional hexagonal PC. The high-symmetry points
of the hexagonal lattice, referenced to the center of an air hole, are a = (0, 0),
b = (a/2, 0), and c = (0, a/√3).

The point group symmetry for TM modes in a 2D hexagonal lattice PC is
C6v. A plot of the approximate in-plane bandstructure (calculated by the plane-wave
expansion technique[18]) for the fundamental TM-like guided modes in this lattice is
given in Figure 1(a), where neﬀ = 3.345 in the dielectric regions, and the ratio of the
hole radius r to lattice spacing a of r/a=0.35 has been chosen.

For the fundamental TM modes of an unpatterned waveguide, the electric ﬁeld
within the mirror plane of the slab is given by Ek⊥(r⊥) = ˆze−i(k⊥·r⊥), where k⊥ and r⊥
are in-plane wavenumber and spatial coordinates, respectively. Upon patterning the
slab waveguide, coupling occurs between waveguide modes with similar unperturbed
frequencies and propagation constants modulo G, where G is a reciprocal lattice
vector. This follows from the (approximate) conservation of frequency and crystal
momentum.

Unlike the case for TE modes, the TM mode bandstructure does not exhibit a
clear in-plane bandgap. Nevertheless, the curvature of the photonic bands is such
that we can still expect localized defect states to form, provided that the modes are
composed of Fourier components that lie in a region of momentum space where a
bandgap does exist (i.e., a partial in-plane bandgap). In particular, the J-point of
the third band (by frequency) has the correct curvature to form donor-type modes,
and enough of a bandgap surrounding it to create localized states (the X-point of the
second band also has the correct curvature, but because the bandgap surrounding it
is somewhat small we will not consider it).

2.1.1. J-point Band-Edge Representation In determining an approximate description
of the modes of the patterned slab waveguide we consider those modes of the
unpatterned slab waveguide that are most strongly coupled considering temporal and
spatial frequency conservation. At the J-point these modes have a scalar electric ﬁeld

things being equal, for modes with electric ﬁeld concentrated within regions of high
dielectric constant to be lower frequency than those with electric ﬁeld concentrated in
low dielectric regions[11]. We associate the set of modes

The approximate J-point band-edge modes derived above have their origin at the
center of an air hole (point a). The hexagonal lattice has two other high-symmetry
points around which one may center a defect, points b and c shown in Figure 1(b).
Unlike point a, points b and c are of lower symmetry than that of the lattice (C2v and
C3v,σv , respectively).

To determine the approximate band-edge modes for defect regions centered about
these points, the lower and higher band modes are simply shifted to each of these
points using the transformations rb

2.1.2. J-point Donor Modes We now consider donor modes, which are formed by
a local increase in the dielectric constant within the photonic lattice. As discussed
previously, the lowest frequency region of k-space for which this can occur, while
still enjoying the beneﬁts of signiﬁcant isolation from other bands, is the J-point
of the third frequency band. Therefore, the appropriate symmetry basis to use for
describing localized donor modes are the band-edge modes of J3a, J3b, and J3c for
defects centered around points a, b, and c, respectively. For defects centered about
point a the largest possible symmetry is that of the underlying hexagonal lattice, C6v,
whereas for defects about point b and point c the largest point group symmetries are
C2v and C3v,σv , respectively. Correspondingly, the character values of representation

and the basis functions J3c onto the IRREPs of C3v,σv , we get the donor modes about
point b. The approximate forms of the donor modes found from these projections are
given in Table 2. Also shown in this table is the new mode structure for a defect
cavity of reduced symmetry (C2v) centered about point a (points b and c are already
of lower point symmetry than the lattice), found by using the compatibility relations
between the IRREPs of the full and reduced symmetry groups.

The key pieces of information given by our approximate description are the
dominant Fourier components that comprise each mode. Approximate forms for
localized defect states can be produced by including some form of an envelope function
along with these approximate symmetry-based forms; in previous work[20], the eﬀects
of the underlying photonic lattice are captured through derivation of a Wannier-like
wave equation for the envelope of resonant TE modes. When combined with the
results of the group theory based analysis, a very accurate picture (as conﬁrmed
by FDTD simulations) of the near-ﬁeld behavior of the defect modes is produced.
A similar Wannier-like equation for TM modes can be generated; however, for the
purposes of this paper, we forego such an analysis and instead obtain more detailed
information directly from FDTD simulations. The key point stressed in Ref. [20] that
is of relevance here is that the ground state envelope functions transform eﬀectively as
the identity operator, and as a result have no bearing on the transformation properties
(i.e., the classiﬁcation of the symmetries of the modes) derived here.

Based on the photonic bandstructure diagrams of Figure 2(a), the candidate
regions of k-space from which we expect to form defect modes include the X-point
oﬀ the second frequency band (conduction band donor modes) and the M -point oﬀ
the fourth frequency band (higher band donor modes). Discussion of the M -point of
the ﬁrst frequency band, also a candidate region of k-space (to create valence band
acceptor modes) is not considered here in the interests of keeping the discussion as
concise as possible. The analysis is quite similar to what was done for the hexagonal
lattice; we begin by forming basis functions to describe the band-edge modes, and then
couple these modes via the symmetry of the defect to get an approximate description
of the cavity modes.

2.2.3. Donor modes For the square PC lattice, as described earlier, two band-
edge minima from which donor modes can be formed are the X-point in the second
frequency band and the M -point in the fourth frequency band (Figure 2(a)). For
a symmetric defect centered at points d and f the band-edge modes at the X
and M points couple to form resonant modes which transform as IRREPs of C4v,
whereas for the lower symmetry point e the defect modes transform as IRREPs
of C2v,σv . The representations describing how the X2d, X2e, and X3f symmetry
bases transform under the appropriate point group are given by Sd,dX2, Se,dX2, and
Sf,dX2, respectively. Similarly, the representations describing how the M 4d, M 4e,
and M 4f symmetry bases transform under the appropriate point group are given by
Sd,dM 4, Se,dM 4, and Sf,dM 4, respectively. From their characters in Table 3 we ﬁnd
that Sd,dX2 = A′′
B′′
B2, and Sf,dX2 = E, while Sd,dM 4 = A′′
1 , Se,dX2 = A1 ⊕
1 ,
Se,dM 4 = B2, and Sf,dM 4 = B′′
. For points d and f , defects may also be formed with
2 k
lower symmetry than the C4v symmetry of the square lattice. Using the compatibility
relations between the IRREPs of the full and reduced symmetry groups, we determine
the new mode structure for a defect of C2v,σv symmetry (i.e., with mirror planes
along the ˆx and ˆy directions of Figure 2(b)). Projecting the diﬀerent symmetry bases
onto the IRREPS of the point group symmetry of the diﬀerent cavities one obtains
approximate forms for the TM donor modes in the square lattice, the results of which
are tabulated in Table 4.

1 ⊕

The symmetries and fundamental momentum components of the possible donor modes formed from
k
the M 4 band-edge are trivially given by a single band-edge mode. This is due to the fact that the
M -point in the square lattice is highly symmetric, and the group of the wave vector mixes all four of
the M -points of the IBZ.

3. FDTD Simulations

In this section, FDTD simulations of the donor defect modes identiﬁed in Section 2 are
presented. The FDTD calculations establish the eﬀectiveness of the chosen symmetry
bases of the group theoretical analysis in describing the defect cavity modes. To reduce
computational time, we limit our study to 2D FDTD simulations with an eﬀective
index used to account for vertical guiding; previous papers[6, 17] have shown that 3D
FDTD simulations of TE-like modes in full PC slab WG defect cavities correspond well
with the modes found through the approximate group theory analysis. The FDTD
calculations were performed on a mesh with 20 points per lattice spacing. Excitation
of the cavity modes was performed by an initial ﬁeld (Ez) with a localized Gaussian
proﬁle, located in a position of low symmetry so as not to exclude any possible resonant
modes. TM modes are selected out by constraining the normal component of the ﬁeld
to be purely Ez, and a pair of mirror planes (σx, σy) were used to ﬁlter out cavity
modes according to their projection on the IRREPs of C2v. Each FDTD-generated
cavity mode is thus labelled by the C2v IRREP by which it transforms and an index
corresponding to its energy (frequency) level.

FDTD-generated results are compared with the results of the symmetry analysis
both through conﬁrmation of the symmetry classiﬁcations under the IRREPs of C2v
(although a careful analysis of all available mirror planes within the FDTD simulations
would allow classiﬁcation under higher symmetries such as C4v or C6v) and through
an analysis of the dominant Fourier components of the modes (through examination
Ez)).

We begin by considering donor-type defect modes in the hexagonal lattice formed
around the J-point of the third frequency band, where from our symmetry analysis
we expect to see modes of A1 and B1 symmetries (under C2v). In Figure 3 we show
two examples of simple defects within the hexagonal lattice, one localized around the
point a of the lattice, the other around point b. The chosen defect around the b-
point in the hexagonal lattice, the defect cavity we will consider here, consists of two
reduced size air holes along the y-axis, with r/a = 0.35 and rdef/a = 0.30 (Figure
3(b)). The spectrum for A1 modes shown in Figure 4(a) shows a single dominant
peak in the frequency range of interest; the real space and Fourier space versions

of this ﬁeld are given in Figure 4(b)-(c), and indicate that the mode has dominant
Fourier components at the six J-points within the IBZ, as predicted by our symmetry
analysis. The Fourier transformed electric ﬁeld for the B1 symmetry mode is shown in
Figure 4(f); the mode has its dominant Fourier components at the six J-points, and is
somewhat delocalized in comparison to the A1 mode (Figure 4(e)). Similar results and
correspondence were found for the defect around point a of the lattice (Figure 3(a)).
As a ﬁnal comment, we note that FDTD-generated spectra for A2 and B2 symmetry
modes were also examined (for both points a and b), and signiﬁcant resonance peaks
were not seen in the frequency range of interest.

3.2. Square Lattice

In Section 2 we identiﬁed three high symmetry points in the square lattice about which
defect modes are formed. For each of these points, we considered donor modes oﬀ the
X point of the second frequency band and M point of the fourth frequency band. We
now present FDTD simulations which verify the symmetry classiﬁcation and Fourier
space composition for the defect modes predicted by the group theory analysis.

Figure 5 shows three examples of defect cavities formed about the d, e, and
f points of the square lattice. We present here the FDTD results for the defect
cavity about the f point. In this cavity a localized defect state is formed that has ˆz-
component of the electric ﬁeld predominantly within the high refractive index material,
which for application as a QC laser cavity would provide the largest possible overlap
factor with the gain region in the semiconductor. Donor modes about the f -point
are created by reducing the size of four air holes (Figure 5(c)). For this example,
we have taken r/a = 0.40 and rdef/a = 0.35. The symmetry classiﬁcations for the
modes predicted in Section 2 are conﬁrmed as this perturbation to the dielectric lattice
creates donor modes of type B1, B2, and A2 symmetry, with the primary B1 mode
at a normalized frequency of a/λ0 = 0.220 (Figure 6(a)), the dominant B2 mode at
a normalized frequency of a/λ0 = 0.220 (Figure 6(d)), and the main A2 mode at

4. Summary and Discussion

The group theory analysis presented in Section 2 can be used to ascertain a number
of important properties about TM-polarized defect modes in connected PC lattices,
and as such, serves as a starting point from which more careful designs of PC defect
cavities can originate. For example, recognizing potential modal degeneracies and
modiﬁcations that can be made to split or remove these degeneracies can be important
in laser design[7, 6]. Coupling of the cavities to other in-plane elements can beneﬁt
from an understanding of the modes’ dominant in-plane emission directions, while
knowledge of the position of ﬁeld nodes/antinodes with respect to the dielectric and air
regions is important as some applications (such as coupling to semiconductor quantum
dots) beneﬁt from ﬁeld maxima in the dielectric regions, while others (such as coupling
to states of cold atoms “dropped” within the cavity) are better served by ﬁeld maxima
in the air holes.

With the results obtained from the group theory analysis in hand, more
sophisticated modeling, such as full 3D FDTD simulations, can be used to determine
more quantitative properties of cavity modes such as modal frequency, cavity quality
factor (Q), and precise near and far-ﬁeld emission pattern. This approach was used in
Ref. [12], which focused on the design of high-Q wavelength-scale PC microcavities. In
this work, the group theory based approach was used to analyze TE-polarized modes
localized to diﬀerent high symmetry points within connected square and hexagonal
lattice PCs. Fourier space design principles were then used to determine which of
these candidate modes were particularly suitable for high-Q applications, and then
full 3D FDTD modeling was used in the ﬁnal design steps.

symmetry mode in a graded square

As a simple example, we conclude by considering the formation of a PC defect
laser cavity for TM-polarized modes (used in conjunction with QC heterostructures,
for example). The square lattice defect cavities considered in Section 2 had fairly
large-size air holes (r/a = 0.45), which in fabricated devices can be problematic for
a number of reasons, including reduced dielectric-ﬁeld overlap (Γ) and poor thermal
stability due to the porosity of the lattice. In electrically injected devices, this porosity

K. Srinivasan and O. Painter, Design of two-dimensional photonic crystal...

could also hinder defect mode lasing, as pumping of the central (defect) region of the
cavity will be more diﬃcult for such small current paths. On the other hand, larger
holes create larger frequency-space gaps in which the modes can be localized. One
method for achieving high in-plane reﬂectivity while reducing the porosity of the lattice
is to employ a graded lattice design[12]. Starting with the requirement that our lasing
mode have an electric ﬁeld antinode in a dielectric region (this mode is similar to the
Ef,dX2
E,1 mode of the f -point defect cavity), we use our group theory based analysis
to select the low-frequency Ee,dX2
A1 mode as a mode of interest. We then employ the
graded lattice geometry shown in Figure 7(a) to create such a mode.
It consists
of two levels of conﬁnement: ﬁrst, an initial jump in hole radius between the holes
a/2) (which have r/a = 0.225) and their nearest neighbors (which
centered at (0,
have r/a = 0.25), and then, a parabolic increase in hole radius moving outwards from
the defect center (with a maximum value r/a = 0.30, equal to the hole size used in
lasing devices in Ref.
[15]). The initial jump in r/a serves as a potential well to
help conﬁne the mode in real space, while the grade allows for the hole radius to
be kept small in the region where the mode is primarily located (to keep Γ high),
but large enough outside of this region to produce a high in-plane reﬂectivity. The
resulting real space ﬁeld Ez and Fourier transform
for the A1 mode are shown
in Figure 7. Based on these images, we see that our initial objectives have been met:
the mode remains well localized to the central region of the cavity, despite having now
chosen considerably smaller holes. With this lattice geometry taken as a template, the
Fourier space design principles of Ref. [12] could now be applied, in conjunction with
3D FDTD simulations, to optimize the cavity Q factor for use in high performance
devices.

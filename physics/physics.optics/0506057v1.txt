Abstract

The dispersion relations for conventional uniaxial dielectric mediums may be char-
acterized as elliptical or elliptical–like, according to whether the medium is nondis-
sipative or dissipative, respectively. However, under certain constitutive parameter
regimes, the dispersion relations may be hyperbolic or hyperbolic–like. We investigate
planewave propagation in a hyperbolic/hyperbolic–like uniaxial dielectric medium. For
both evanescent and nonevanescent propagation, the phase velocity is found to be pos-
itive with respect to the time–averaged Poynting vector. A conceptualization of a
hyperbolic–like uniaxial medium as a homogenized composite medium is presented.

Keywords: Hyperbolic dispersion relations, elliptical dispersion relations, Bruggeman ho-
mogenization formalism

1 Introduction

As the materials sciences and technologies continue their rapid development, realistic pos-
sibilities are emerging of realizing so–called metamaterials with novel and hitherto uncon-
sidered optical/electromagnetic properties. A prime example is provided by the recently

discovered metamaterials which support planewave propagation with negative phase velocity
(NPV), and thereby negative refraction. Until 2000, little attention had been paid to the
phenomenon of negative refraction. Since 2000, there has been an explosion of interest in
negative refraction [1, 2], following experimental reports of a metamaterial which supports
negative refraction in the microwave regime [3].

Naturally–occurring uniaxial crystals have been extensively studied ever since the earliest
days of the optical sciences. However, the electromagnetic properties of uniaxial mediums
have recently been revisited by theoreticians in consideration of the prospects for NPV
propagation in such mediums [4, 5, 6, 7]. A closely related issue concerns uniaxial dielectric–
magnetic mediums with indeﬁnite constitutive dyadics [8, 9].

The deﬁning characteristic of a uniaxial dielectric medium is a distinguished axis of
symmetry, known as the optic axis. Mathematically, the permittivity dyadic of a uniaxial
dielectric medium may be expressed as

where a coordinate system has been selected in which the direction of the optic axis coincides
with the direction of the unit vector ˆx lying along the x axis, and I denotes the 3
3 identity
dyadic. The real–valued parameter

may be usefully employed to characterize planewave propagation in the medium speciﬁed
by (1). The upper expression is appropriate to nondissipative mediums whereas the lower
expression is appropriate to dissipative mediums.

The electromagnetic/optical properties of uniaxial mediums with γ > 0 — this category
includes naturally–occurring uniaxial crystals — have long been established. Comprehensive
descriptions can be found in standard works [10, 11]. Uniaxial mediums with γ < 0 are much
more exotic. Interest in these mediums stems from their potential applications in negatively
refracting scenarios [8, 9] and in diﬀraction gratings [12], for example.

Planewave propagation in a uniaxial medium is characterized in terms of a dispersion
relation which is quadratic in terms of the corresponding wavevector components. The dis-
persion relations for nondissipative mediums with γ > 0 have an elliptical representation,
whereas a hyperbolic representation is associated with γ < 0. In this communication we in-
vestigate the planewave characteristics and conceptualization of uniaxial dielectric mediums
with hyperbolic dispersion relations.

We analytically explore the nondissipative scenario for nonevanescent and evanescent
planewave propagation in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, whereas both the dissipative
and the nondissipative scenarios are treated graphically in Section 2.5.

2.3 Nonevanescent propagation

By (14), the inequality

−
is satisﬁed for nonevanescent planewave propagation in a nondissipative medium, where γ is
deﬁned in (2). Thus, Im

= 0. We explore the cases γ > 0 and γ < 0 separately.

an elliptical representation in (α, βex) space.

−

(i) If γ < 0 then the inequality (18) reduces to ω2ǫµ0 < α2. Therefore, we see that

when ǫ < 0. In geometric terms, the wavevector components

Hence, nonevanescent plane waves have PPV regardless of the sign of γ or ǫx.

2.4 Evanescent propagation

by the inequality

Hence, evanescent plane waves have PPV if (a) γ < 0 or (b) γ > 0 and ǫx > 0. However,
negative phase velocity (NPV) propagation arises if γ > 0 and ǫx < 0.

Illustrative examples

Let us illustrate the geometric aspect of the dispersion relations with some representative
numerical examples.

First, suppose we consider the case γ > 0 with ǫ = 2ǫ0 and ǫx = 6ǫ0, where ǫ0 is the
free–space permittivity. In Figure 1 the real and imaginary parts of βex are plotted against
ω√2ǫ0µ0 <
α. The elliptical nonevanescent nature of the dispersion relation is clear for
−
α < ω√2ǫ0µ0, while the hyperbolic evanescent nature is apparent for α <
ω√2ǫ0µ0 and
α > ω√2ǫ0µ0. The elliptical/hyperbolic geometric interpretation breaks down when dissi-
pative mediums are considered. However, the corresponding dispersion relations are geo-
metrically reminiscent of their nondissipative counterparts. This can be observed in Fig-
ure 2 in which the graphs corresponding to Figure 1 are displayed for ǫ = (2 + i0.5) ǫ0 and
ǫx = (6 + i0.75) ǫ0.

−

Second, we turn to the case γ < 0 with ǫ = 2ǫ0 and ǫx =

6ǫ0. The real and imaginary
parts of βex are graphed against α in Figure 3. The graphs mirror those of Figure 1 but with
nonevanescent and evanscent aspects interchanged; i.e., we observe hyperbolic nonevanescent
ω√2ǫ0µ0 and α > ω√2ǫ0µ0, and elliptical evanescent characteristics
characteristics for α <
ω√2ǫ0µ0 < α < ω√2ǫ0µ0. The corresponding graphs for ǫ = (2 + i0.5) ǫ0 and ǫx =

−
6 + i0.75) ǫ0 are presented in Figure 4. Notice that the shapes of the graphs in Figures 4
(

and 2 are similar but not identical.

3 Numerical conceptualization

Although uniaxial dielectric mediums with γ < 0 do not occur in nature (to the best of the
authors’ knowledge), they can be conceptualized as metamaterials by means of homogeniza-
tion.

6

For example, let us consider the homogenization of a composite comprising two compo-
nent materials phases, labelled as a and b. Both component material phases are taken to
be isotropic dielectric mediums: ǫa and ǫb denote the permittivity scalars of phases a and
b, respectively. The component material phases are envisioned as random distributions of
identically–oriented, spheroidal particles. The spheroidal shape — which is taken to be the
same for all spheroids in component material phase a and b — is parameterized via the shape
dyadic U = diag (Ux, U, U). That is, we take the spheroid’s principal axis to lie along the x
axis. The spheroid’s surface is prescribed by the vector

r s(θ, φ) = η U • ˆr(θ, φ) ,

with ˆr being the radial unit vector speciﬁed by the spherical polar coordinates θ and φ. The
linear dimensions of the spheroid, as determined by the parameter η, are assumed to be
small relative to the electromagnetic wavelength(s).

The permittivity dyadic of the resulting homogenized composite medium (HCM)

as estimated using the Bruggeman homogenization formalism, is provided implicitly via

Closed–form expressions for the depolarization dyadic for uniaxial mediums are available in
terms of hyperbolic functions [15]. However, we note that these exact results are not valid
for nondissipative mediums with γ < 0, and numerical evaluation of D has to be resorted
to.

Let us consider the homogenization scenario wherein material component phase a is taken
to be iron at 670 nm free–space wavelength. Correspondingly, we take ǫa = (
4.34 + i20.5) ǫ0.
The material component phase b is assumed to be free space; i.e., ǫb = ǫ0. The shape of
the component spheroids is speciﬁed by Ux/U = 12. The Bruggeman estimates of the HCM
permittivity parameters ǫHCM and ǫHCM
are plotted as functions of volume fraction fa in
Figure 5. At intermediate values of fa we see that γ < 0 for a substantial range of fa values.
Extensive accounts of similar numerical homogenizations, based on the Bruggeman for-

malism and more general approaches, can be found elsewhere [13, 16].

4 Concluding remarks

The dispersion relations for uniaxial dielectric mediums have been characterized with respect
to the parameter γ (2). For γ < 0, the dispersion relations are hyperbolic for nondissipative
mediums and hyperbolic–like for dissipative mediums. Similarly, the dispersion relations
are elliptical for nondissipative mediums and elliptical–like for dissipative mediums with
γ > 0. Through the homogenization of isotropic component material phases based on
spheroidal topology, we demonstrate that metamaterials with γ < 0 may be straightforwardly
conceptualized. Thus, a practical means of achieving the exotic electromagnetic properties
associated with hyperbolic and hyperbolic–like uniaxial mediums is presented.

A birefringent phenomenon is observed in extraordinary optical transmission when

the array with periodic of subwavelength holes is tilted.

It is found that linear

polarization states can be changed to elliptical polarization states and a phase can

be added between two eigenmodes. A model based on surface plasmon eigenmodes

degeneracy is also presented to explain these experimental results.

Since it was ﬁrst reported in 1998[1], the extraordinary optical transmission (EOT)

through periodic arrays of subwavelength holes has attracted much attention owing to its

fundamental implications and its technological potential. Generally, it is believed that metal

surface plays a crucial role and the phenomenon is mediated by surface plasmons (SPs) and

there is a process of transform photon to surface plasmon and back to photon[2, 3, 4].
In 2002, E. Altewischer et al.

[5] ﬁrst showed that polarization entanglement of photon

pairs can be preserved when they respectively travel through a hole array. Therefore, the

macroscopic surface plasmon polarizations, a collective excitation wave involving typically

1010 free electrons propagating at the surface of conducting matter, have a true quantum

nature. After that, polarization properties of EOT were investigated in many works. For

example, strong polarization dependence was observed in EOT of elliptical nanoholes[6, 7];

polarization tomography of metallic nanohole arrays has also been done recently[8, 9].

The mode of excited surface plasmon is related to the periodic structure and the polar-

ization of the incident light. Usually, the surface plasmon eigenmodes are degenerate due to

the symmetry of the hole array and the polarization of photon can be preserved in the EOT

process[5, 8].

In a recent paper, splitting of degenerate surface plasmon eigenmodes was

observed[10]. Then, is there any inﬂuence on the polarization of transmitted photons if the

degeneracy of surface plasmon eigenmodes are removed? A feasible method to remove the

degeneracy is tilting the hole array. In our work, it was found that photons with the same

linear polarization can be transformed into various elliptical polarization states if the hole

2

array was tilted. In detail, if the photons were polarized along the eigenmode directions of

surface plasmons, the polarization states were not changed. Otherwise, a phase was gener-

ated between diﬀerent surface plasmons, as in a birefringent process. A linear polarization

Fig. 1 shows the sketch map of our hole array. It is produced as follows: after subsequently

evaporating a 3-nm titanium bonding layer and a 135-nm gold layer onto a 0.5-mm-thick

silica glass substrate, a Electron Beam Lithography System (EBL, Raith 150 of Raith Co.)

is used to produce cylindrical holes (200nm diameter) arranged as a square lattice (600nm

period). The total area of the hole array is 300µm

300µm. The arrow indicates the tilting

direction.

In experiment, white light from a stabilized tungsten-halogen source passed though sin-

gle mode ﬁber and 4nm ﬁlter (center wavelength 702 nm) to generate 702nm wavelength

photons. Polarization of input light was controlled by a polarizer, a HWP (half wave plate,

702nm) and a QWP (quarter wave plate, 702nm). The hole array was set between two lenses

of 35mm focal length, so that the light was normally incident on the hole array with a cross

sectional diameter about 20µm and covered hundreds of holes. Symmetrically, a QWP, a

HWP and a polarizer were combined to analyze the polarization of transmitted photons. Sil-

For our sample, photons with 702nm wavelength will excite the surface plasmon eigen-

modes (0,

rection with tilt angle θ as shown in Fig. 1. First, transmission eﬃciencies of photons in

horizontal and vertical polarization were measured. For photons in horizontal polarization,

the transmission eﬃciency was kept constant, while for photons in vertical polarization, the

transmission eﬃciency was changing with the tilt angle θ( see Fig. 3(a)). It was also found

that for photons which were polarized along the eigenmode directions (here horizontal and

vertical), the polarization of transmitted photons were not changed. Then photons in polar-

A simple model was given below to explain the experimental results. As we know, the

interaction of the incident light with surface plasmon is made allowed by coupling through

the grating momentum and obeys conservation of momentum

eﬃciency was the sum of the two cases. This deﬁnitely inﬂuence the transmission eﬃciency

of photons in 702nm wavelength as shown in Fig. 3(a). A theoretical calculation was given

in Fig. 3(b), which was just a simple addition of two moved transmission peaks. In the

calculation we supposed that the shape of the transmission peaks was not changed for the

sake of simpliﬁcation. It had a similar curve with the experimental data.

Further, since −→k sp(0,+1) 6

Polarization state tomography method was used to analyze the output states. The output

states were also pure polarization states even they were diﬀerent from the input states.

Phase β was correlated with the diﬀerence between −→k sp(0,+1) and −→k sp(0,−1)(or 2−→k 0), which

was determined by the rotation angle θ. Fig. 4 gives the relation between phase β and tilt

angle θ. This can be seen as a birefringent phenomenon.

In conclusion, we found that when the hole array was tilted in the EOT process, not only

the transmission spectra was inﬂuenced, but also a birefringent phenomenon appeared. The

results might come from the removal of surface plasmon eigenmodes. Our results may give

us more hints on the polarization properties of EOT.

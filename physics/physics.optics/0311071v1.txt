Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) processes are “coherent,” but the phase of the
anti-Stokes radiation is usually lost by most incoherent spectroscopic CARS measurements. We
propose a novel Raman microscopy imaging method called Nonlinear Interferometric Vibrational
Imaging, which measures Raman spectra by obtaining the temporal anti-Stokes signal through
nonlinear interferometry. With a more complete knowledge of the anti-Stokes signal, we show
through simulations that a high-resolution Raman spectrum can be obtained of a molecule in a
single pulse using broadband radiation. This could be useful for identifying the three-dimensional
spatial distribution of molecular species in tissue.

Functional imaging techniques have been developed to
provide insight into biological processes. Optical func-
tional imaging is frequently limited because dyes or mark-
ers must be introduced that alter or damage biologi-
cal tissues. Because it is preferable to use endogenous
properties of tissues to identify molecular contents, meth-
ods such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy are used.
In particular, Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering
(CARS) processes have been successfully integrated with
confocal scanning microscopes [1, 2, 3] to achieve three-
dimensional molecular images of vibrational resonances.
However, existing instruments measure only the total
power of the received anti-Stokes radiation. We propose
a novel method, Nonlinear Interferometric Vibrational
Imaging (NIVI), which utilizes nonlinear interferometry
to measure the amplitude and phase of the anti-Stokes
light. An experimental demonstration of the principle
of this technique has been demonstrated. [4]. This addi-
tional phase information facilitates the inference of the
amplitude and phase of the nonlinear susceptibility of the
molecule. By utilizing NIVI with properly designed illu-
minating radiation, a large region of the amplitude and
phase of the Raman spectrum can be sampled in a single
brief pulse.

Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering processes
have only recently been used to probe biological spec-
imens. The appeal of CARS is that it can probe the
density of molecules with a particular Raman resonance
frequency while exposing the specimen to relatively low
levels of illumination. A typical CARS process illumi-
nates the specimen with a pump pulse of frequency ω1,
and a Stokes pulse of frequency ω2, which are separated

by the vibrational frequency of interest Ω = ω1 − ω2. If
a molecule with a Raman resonance at frequency Ω is
present, an anti-Stokes pulse at frequency 2ω1 − ω2 is

and Stokes beams are scanned through the specimen,
and the anti-Stokes photon count is measured at each
point. This photon count is proportional to the square
of the molecular bond density and the magnitude of the
Raman susceptibility. Nonlinear interferometry has been
used to characterize the magnitude of the stimulated Ra-
man scattering nonlinearity in liquids [5], and also of two
CARS signals [6] in gases.

The model of CARS with broadband pulses used here
is similar to that described by [7, 8]. We do not assume
that the illuminating radiation is narrowband. However,
we stipulate that the molecule does not resonantly inter-
act directly with any of the frequencies inside the illu-
mination bandwidth or the generated anti-Stokes band-
width of the optical signal. The CARS process is com-
posed of two stimulated Raman scattering processes in-
volving four photons that begins and ends with the
molecule in the ground state. To describe CARS, we de-
note the electric ﬁeld incident on the molecule as ˜Ei(ω).
The ﬁrst process is modeled by Eq. 1, and excites the
nonlinear dipole polarization of the resonant transition.

Each pair of frequencies that are separated by a reso-
nance of the molecule at frequency Ω produces a nonlin-
ear polarization in the molecule. Another way to look
at Eq. 1 is that, in the time domain, the molecule has
a nonlinear polarization that is driven not by the elec-
tric ﬁeld but by the instantaneous intensity envelope of

changes in χ(3) that are dependent on the “carrier” en-
velope frequency on which the beats are imposed. There-
fore any pulse train with intensity beats at the resonance
frequency will stimulate the nonlinear polarization. Ex-
amples of this are pulses that are modulated periodically
in the spectral domain with period Ω [7, 8, 9], and in-
terfering two relatively delayed chirped pulses to achieve
a beat frequency proprortional to time delay [10]. The
second step creates anti-Stokes radiation by mixing the
incoming radiation ﬁeld with the polarization in the time
domain, and is modeled by Eq. 2. The Eqs. 1 and 2 allow
one to calculate the emitted CARS radiation ˜Eo(ω) for
a given ˜Ei(ω) and χ(3)(Ω). While these relations do not
constitute a linear relationship between ˜Ei(ω) and ˜Eo(ω),
there is a linear dependence of ˜Eo(ω) on χ(3)(Ω) given an
input ﬁeld ˜Ei(ω). This suggests that with knowledge of
the complex ˜Eo(ω), one can do linear estimation to ﬁnd
χ(3)(Ω). The advantage of NIVI over incoherent detec-
tion is that nonlinear interferometry enables the recovery
of the complex ˜Eo(ω). With a properly designed input
pulse ˜Ei(ω), the nonlinear susceptibility can be found in
a particular frequency range.

NIVI takes advantage of the coherent nature of the
CARS process to allow the phase-sensitive measurement
of the anti-Stokes radiation. Conventional linear inter-
ferometry involves splitting a source light beam into two
parts, each of which scatters linearly in the ﬁeld, and
which are then recombined and detected. NIVI diﬀers in
that a CARS process occurs to one of the split beams.

NIVI can be implemented with the setup detailed
in Fig. 1. We start with a broadband, phase-locked
source of light pulses, such as those from a mode-locked
laser. Sources that can produce such light are ultra-
broadband mode-locked Ti-sapphire oscillators [12], and
supercontinuum sources [13, 14]. Because the source
is phase-locked, there is a deterministic relationship be-
tween phases at various frequencies. This deterministic
relationship will be preserved by coherent processes such
as CARS. To utilize this determinacy, the source band-
width is split into higher and lower frequency bands, as
shown in Fig. 1 with a dichroic beamsplitter. The higher
frequency band will be a reference signal ˜R(ω), and will
correspond to the bandwidth of the anti-Stokes frequen-
cies produced by a sample. The lower frequency band is
temporally shaped to stimulate CARS in the sample, a
signal we denote by the frequency spectrum ˜Ei(ω). Some
of the illumination signal will be converted to anti-Stokes
radiation by the sample. Because CARS processes are
usually rather weak, we will assume that any new anti-

Stokes radiation created in the same bandwidth as the
illumination will be inseparable from the illumination.
Therefore we will discard all anti-Stokes light inside the
illumination bandwidth with a high-pass frequency ﬁl-
ter. The remaining anti-Stokes light that passes through
the ﬁlter, which we denote by the spectrum ˜Eo(ω), corre-
sponds to frequencies in the reference signal. We combine
the reference signal ˜R(ω) and the anti-Stokes spectrum
˜Eo(ω) with a 50:50 beam splitter, and utilize balanced de-
tection to measure the intereference component on two
photodetectors. There is a delay of time ∆t placed in
the reference path to facilitate measuring the temporal
cross-correlation between the reference and anti-Stokes
signals. The diﬀerence in the two intensities ∆I(∆t) as
a function of delay between the signal and reference will
be:

(3)
If we call ˜I(ω) the Fourier transform of ∆I(∆t) with re-
spect to ∆t, we ﬁnd that ∆ ˜I(ω) = 4 ˜Eo(ω)∗ ˜R(ω). Thus
the measured data retains its linear relationship with re-
spect to the anti-Stokes spectrum ˜Eo(ω) and therefore
the nonlinear susceptibility χ(3)(Ω).

Besides the ability to ﬁnd the complex-valued χ(3)(Ω),
interferometry eliminates the need for photon-counting
detectors. Another advantage is that interference will
only occur when the anti-Stokes light and the reference
light arrive at the beam splitter at the same time. Be-
cause of this, temporal gating can be used to produce
three-dimensional vibrational images in a manner analo-
gous to Optical Coherence Tomography [15, 16, 17]. Co-
herent detection is also far less sensitive to stray light
than photon counting. Because of this, NIVI may be

3

more adaptable to various scanning conﬁgurations and
environments outside the laboratory.

To show that NIVI can measure intervals of the Ra-
man spectrum in a single pulse, a pulse must be designed
that can stimulate molecules in a broad Raman spec-
trum. The approach we take creates beats that instead
of being of a constant frequency [10], will be themselves

chirped. This can be accomplished by combining two
chirped pulses with a relative delay, but with diﬀerent
chirp rates. If we have a transform-limited pulsed source
of center frequency ω0 and bandwidth ∆ω, and we wish
to sweep the beat frequency from ΩL to ΩH in time T ,
we can design a pulse ˜Ei(ω) such that:

The variable α is the common chirp to both pulses, β
is the diﬀerence chirp, τ is the time delay between the
two pulses, and κ is the diﬀerence in ﬁeld magnitude be-
tween the two pulses. The pulse bandwidth has been
apodized with a cosine window because in practice it
seems to help the stability of the inversion. Note that
the bandwidth of the source ∆ω must exceed ΩH so that
beats can be formed at all Raman frequencies. When
creating the pulse, the chirp time T will control the reso-
lution with which one will be able to resolve frequencies
in the Raman spectrum. The largest practical T is de-
termined by the dephasing time of the resonances, which
in most liquids is on the order of picoseconds.

To demonstrate the feasibility of NIVI, we simulate
the illumination of a target molecule with the broadband
pulse of Eq. 4 and use the returned signal to estimate the
complex susceptibility χ(3)(Ω). We will show two simu-
lations: one that is able to probe a wide bandwidth of
Raman resonances in a single pulse, and the other which
is able to distinguish between two nearby resonances. We
take as our hypothetical laser source a mode-locked Ti-
sapphire laser that can produce a pulse with a uniform
bandwidth from 700–1000 nm, and the setup of Fig. 1.
The bandwidth from 800–1000 nm will be reserved for
stimulating CARS, with the remainder used as the ref-
erence signal. For the ﬁrst simulation, the CARS excita-
tion bandwidth will be shaped such that ΩL = 700 cm−1,
ΩH = 1300 cm−1, and T = 5 ps. To show that the sys-
tem can reconstruct several simultaneous resonances over
the entire bandwidth, we create a hypothetical χ(3)(Ω)
with several Lorentzian resonances centered at 800 cm−1,
900 cm−1, 1000 cm−1, and 1100 cm−1. These frequen-
cies are in the Raman “ﬁngerprint” region and would be
useful for practical molecular identiﬁcation.

The simulation was implemented by sampling the spec-
tra of χ(3)(Ω), ˜Ei(ω), and ˜Eo(ω) with 20,000 points
spaced at equal intervals from 0 cm−1 to 20000 cm−1 in

1.0 cm−1 steps. The cross-correlations of Eqs. 1 and 2
were computed using the Fast Fourier Transform. These
two equations form a “forward” CARS linear operator
computing χ(3)(Ω) from ˜Eo(ω) which we call A(ω, Ω). To
ﬁnd the inverse of this operator, we used the Tikhonov-
regularized least-squares inversion operator, which is for-
mally denoted by A∗ = (A†A + ǫI)−1A†. The Tikhonov
regularization was included to improve the stability of the
inverse and to account for potential noise sources such
as thermal and photon noise in a practical experiment.
The constant ǫ is chosen to account for the magnitude of
additive white Gaussian noise in a realistic experiment.
In practice, A∗ was computed using the preconditioned
conjugate gradient [18] method to avoid the very com-
putationally expensive direct matrix inversion. While we
do not model a real noise source here, Tikhonov regular-
ization adjusts the inverse operator such that features of
the estimated spectrum χ(3)(Ω) that would be unstable
due to insuﬃcient information for reconstruction would
tend towards zero.

The left column of Figure 2 shows the temporal and
spectral shapes of the input pulse. Part (a) shows two
chirped pulses that partially overlap, producing a beat
pattern that stimulates the resonance. Part (b) shows
the power spectrum of the input pulse. Part (c) shows
the anti-Stokes radiation spectrum, that is calculated us-
ing Eqs. 1 and 2. Because the excitation light is assumed
to be much more powerful that the anti-Stokes light, we
ﬁlter out all of the excitation bandwidth and utilize only
wavelengths shorter than 800 nm for the inverse. The
right column of Figure 2 shows the original and recon-
structed χ(3)(Ω). Part (d) is the magnitude of the spec-
trum of the intensity of the original pulse, i.e. the beat
frequencies of the pulse. It shows the possible measurable
Raman frequencies with this pulse. Part (e) shows the
original χ(3)(Ω) Raman spectrum magnitude. Finally,

structed χ(3)(Ω) based on only the anti-Stokes frequen-
cies from 700–800 nm. In simulation, all of the spectral
lines can be recovered. The minimum discernible sep-
aration in Raman frequencies tends to increase as the
Raman frequency decreases because the anti-Stokes ra-
diation created by lower frequency resonances tends to
overlap the original spectrum more.

As a second demonstration with two closely spaced
Raman lines, we consider deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),
which would be contained in the nucleus of a cell, and ri-
bonucleic acid (RNA) located throughout the cell. Both
macromolecules have PO2 phosphodiester resonances,
but the resonance occurs in DNA at 1094 cm−1 and in
RNA at 1101 cm−1. To show that a properly designed
pulse can recover both resonances distinctly, we design
a χ(3)(Ω) that has resonances both at 1094 cm−1 and
1101 cm−1, that could be created by mixing DNA and
RNA. To probe this mixture, we create a pulse using
Eq. 4 with ΩL = 1070 cm−1, ΩH = 1130 cm−1, and
T = 5 ps. The results of this simulation are shown in
Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the beat frequency spectrum,
and original and reconstructured χ(3)(Ω) Raman spec-
tra. While the reconstructed lines are broadened, they
are still quite distinct and would be useful for discerning
the two molecules.

NIVI is a ﬂexible tool utilizing ultrafast pulses that
can measure small or large portions of a Raman spec-
trum of a molecule in a single pulse. It does so by inter-
ferometrically measuring the anti-Stokes radiation from
a molecule, stimulated by beats in intensity of an ex-
citation ﬁeld. From this anti-Stokes ﬁeld, the complex

Raman susceptibility can be estimated. It is especially
suited to biological imaging because while the pulse en-
ergy can be large, the peak power can remain small by
chirping the pulse. For these reasons, we believe that
NIVI can be a general tool for noninvasively probing the
molecular content of biological tissues.

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We describe the action of a plane interface between two semi-inﬁnite media in terms of a transfer
matrix. We ﬁnd a remarkably simple factorization of this matrix, which enables us to express the
Fresnel coeﬃcients as a hyperbolic rotation.

Keywords: Fresnel formulas, hyperbolic rotations, reﬂection and transmission of light waves.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Reﬂection and transmission at a discontinuity are
perhaps the ﬁrst wavelike phenomena that one en-
counters in any undergraduate physics course. The
physics underlying this behavior is well understood: mis-
matched impedances generate the reﬂected and trans-
mitted waves, while the application of the proper bound-
ary conditions at the discontinuity provide their corre-
sponding amplitude coeﬃcients [1]. Moreover, this gen-
eral framework facilitates a uniﬁed treatment for all the
types of waves appearing in Nature.

For light waves the impedance is proportional to the
refractive index. Accordingly, the behavior of light at
the plane interface between two semi-inﬁnite media are
derived in most optics textbooks [2, 3, 4]. The resulting
amplitude coeﬃcients are described by the famous Fres-
nel formulas. It seems almost impossible to say anything
new about these Fresnel formulas. However, a quick look
at the indexes of this Journal [5], among others [6, 7],
immediately reveals a steady ﬂow of papers devoted to
subtle aspects of this problem, which shows that the topic
is far richer than one might naively expect.

In this paper we reeleborate once again on this theme.
We present the action of any interface in terms of a trans-
fer matrix, and we ﬁnd a hitherto unsuspectedly simple
factorization of this matrix. After renormalizing the ﬁeld
amplitudes, such a factorization leads us to introduce a
new parameter in terms of which Fresnel formulas appear
as a hyperbolic rotation.

As our teaching experience demonstrates, the students
have troubles in memorizing Fresnel formulas due to their
fairly complicated appearance. In this respect, there are
at least two reasons that, in our opinion, bear out the
interest of our contribution: ﬁrst, Fresnel formulas ap-
pears in the new variables as a hyperbolic rotation that
introduces remarkable simplicity and symmetry. Second,
this formalism is directly linked to other ﬁelds of physics,
mainly to special relativity, which is more than a curios-
ity [8, 9, 10].

II. THE INTERFACE TRANSFER MATRIX

Let two homogeneous isotropic semi-inﬁnite media, de-
scribed by complex refractive indices N0 and N1, be sep-
arated by a plane boundary. The Z axis is chosen per-

pendicular to the boundary and directed as in Fig. 1.

We assume an incident monochromatic, linearly polar-
ized plane wave from medium 0, which makes an angle
θ0 with the Z axis and has amplitude E(+)
. The electric
ﬁeld is either in the plane of incidence (denoted by super-
) or perpendicular to the plane of incidence (su-
script
). This wave splits into a reﬂected wave E(r)
perscript
in medium 0, and a transmitted wave E(t)
in medium 1
that makes and angle θ1 with the Z axis. The angles of
incidence θ0 and refraction θ1 are related by the Snell’s
law

N0 sin θ0 = N1 sin θ1.

If media 0 and 1 are transparent (so that N0 and N1 are
real numbers) and no total reﬂection occurs, the angles θ0
and θ1 are also real and the above picture of how a plane
wave is reﬂected and refracted at the interface is simple.
However, when either one or both media is absorbing,
the angles θ0 and θ1 become, in general, complex and
the discussion continues to hold only formally, but the
physical picture of the ﬁelds becomes complicated [11].

We consider as well another plane wave of the same
frequency and polarization, and amplitude E(−)
, incident
from medium 1 at an angle θ1, as indicated in Fig. 1. In
the same way, we shall denote by E(r)
the re-
ﬂected and transmitted amplitudes of the corresponding
waves.

The complex amplitudes of the total output ﬁelds at
opposite points immediately above and below the inter-
face will be called E(−)
and E(+)
, respectively. The wave
vectors of all waves lie in the plane of incidence and when
the incident ﬁelds are
polarized, all plane waves

excited by the incident ones have the same polarization.

where r01 and t01 are the Fresnel reﬂection and trans-
mission coeﬃcients for the interface 01, and r10 and t10
refer to the corresponding coeﬃcients for the interface 10.
These Fresnel coeﬃcients are determined by demanding
that across the boundary the tangential components of E
and H should be continuous [2]. For nonmagnetic media

they are given by

for both basic polarizations.
It is worth noting that,
although these equations are written for electromag-
netic waves, it is possible to translate all the results for
particle-wave scattering, since there is a one-to-one cor-
respondence between the propagation in an interface be-
tween two media of electromagnetic waves and of the non-
relativistic particle waves satisfying Schr¨odinger equa-
tion [12].

The linearity revealed by Eqs. (2) suggests the use of
2
2 matrix methods. However, Eqs. (2) links output
to input ﬁelds, while the standard way of treating this
topic is by relating the ﬁeld amplitudes at each side of
the interface. Such a relation is expressed as [13, 14]

The choice of these column vectors is motivated from
the optics of layered media, since it is the only way of
calculating the ﬁeld amplitudes at each side of every layer
by an ordered product of matrices.

We shall call I01 the interface transfer matrix and, from

Eqs. (2), is given by

By using a matrix formulation of the boundary condi-
tions [15] one can factorize the interface transfer matrix
I01 in the new and remarkable form [7] (that otherwise
one can also check directly using the Fresnel formulas)

Now, it is straightforward to convince oneself that a diag-
onal matrix postmultiplied by R(π/4) and premultiplied
by its inverse is always of the form

a and b being, in general, complex numbers. This result
implies that I01 in Eq. (6) must be also of this form, which
turns out the constraints

This applies to both basic polarizations by the simple at-
tachment of a label to all the coeﬃcients and constitutes
an alternative algebraic demonstration of the well-known
Stokes relations without resorting to the usual time-
reversal argument [12, 15]. Similar results can be also
derived in particle scattering from the unitarity require-
ment on the S matrix. However, note that the equality
implied by Eq. (10) can become counter-
r10|
|
intuitive when applied to particle reﬂection, since one
might expect stronger reﬂection for particle waves mov-
ing up in a potential gradient than for those going down.
In fact, these relations, as emphasized by Lekner [12],
ensure that the reﬂectivity is exactly the same in the two
cases, unless there is total internal reﬂection.

In summary, these Stokes relations allows one to

It is worth noting that the inverse matrix satisﬁes
I−1
01 = I10 and then describes the interface taken in the
reverse order. The physical meaning of these matrix ma-
nipulations is analyzed in Section V.

III. RENORMALIZATION OF FIELD
AMPLITUDES

From Eqs. (7) one directly obtain that, for both basic

polarizations, we have

det Ik

01 = det I⊥

01 =

= 1.

(12)

For the reasons that will become clear in Section IV, it
is adequate to renormalize the ﬁeld amplitudes to ensure
that the transfer matrix has always unit determinant. To
this end, let us deﬁne

It is now evident from Eq. (15) that the renormalized
interface matrix satisﬁes det i01 = +1, as desired. More-
over, by taking into account the general form given in
Eq. (11), we can reinterpret i01 in terms of renormalized
Fresnel coeﬃcients as

This relation does not trivially reduce to the conservation

It is clear from Eqs. (19) that the single parameter
ξ01 gives all the information about the interface, even for
absorbing media or when total reﬂection occurs. We have
01 = i10; that is, the inverse also describes the interface
i−1
taken in the reverse order. Thus, ξ10 = 1/ξ01 and it

glass (N0/N1 = 2/3) and, for the purpose of comparison,
the corresponding values of rk

about these amplitude coeﬃcients and the corresponding
phase shifts can be developed much in the same way as
it is done in most of the undergraduate optics textbooks.

IV. THE INTERFACE AS A HYPERBOLIC
ROTATION

The deﬁnition of the renormalized transfer matrix for
an interface in Eq. (15) may appear, at ﬁrst sight, rather
artiﬁcial. In this Section we shall interpret its meaning
by recasting it in an appropriate form that will reveal the
origin of the rotation matrices R(π/4).

To simplify as much as possible the discussion, let us
assume that we are dealing with an interface between
two transparent media when no total reﬂection occurs. In
this relevant case, the Fresnel reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients, and therefore ξ01, are real numbers. Let us
introduce a new parameter ζ01 by

ξ01 = exp(ζ01/2).

(23)

Then, the action of the interface can be expressed as

e(+)
0
e(−)
0 !

(24)
where the renormalized Fresnel coeﬃcients can be writ-
ten now as

r01 = tanh(ζ01/2),

b
t01 =

1
cosh(ζ01/2)

.

b

(25)

Given the importance of this new reformulation of the
action of an interface, some comments seem pertinent:
it is clear that the reﬂection coeﬃcient can be always
expressed as a hyperbolic tangent, whose addition law is
simple. In fact, such an important result was ﬁrst derived
by Khashan [16] and is the origin of several approaches
for treating the reﬂection coeﬃcient of layered struc-
tures [17], including bilinear or quotient functions [18],
that are just of the form (19). However, the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient for these structures seems to be (almost)
safely ignored in the literature, because it behaves as a
hyperbolic secant, whose addition law is more involved.
Now the meaning of the rotation R(π/4) can be put
forward in a clear way. To this end, note that the trans-
formation (24) is formally a hyperbolic rotation of angle
ζ01/2 acting on the complex ﬁeld variables [e(+), e(−)].
As it is usual in hyperbolic geometry [19], it is conve-
nient to study this transformation in a coordinate frame
whose new axes are the bisecting lines of the original one.
In other words, in this frame whose axes are rotated π/4
respect to the original one, the new coordinates are

V. THE PHYSICAL MEANING OF INTERFACE
COMPOSITION

To conclude, it seems adequate to provide a physical
picture of the matrix manipulations we have performed
in this paper. First, the inverse of an interface matrix, as
pointed out before, describes the interface taken in the
reverse order.

Concerning the product of interface matrices, this
operation has physical meaning only when the second
medium of the ﬁrst interface is identical to the ﬁrst
medium of the second one.
In this case, let us con-
sider the interfaces 01 and 12. A direct calculation from
Eqs. (7) shows that

I01I12 = I02,

(31)

for both basic polarizations, which is equivalent to the
constraints

(32)

r02 =

r01 + r12
1 + r01r12

t02 =

t01t12
1 + r01r12

,

.

Note that the reﬂected-amplitude composition behaves
as a tanh addition law, just as in the famous Einstein
addition law for collinear velocities: no matter what val-
ues the reﬂection amplitudes r01 and r12 (subject only
1) have, the modulus of the
to
composite amplitude
) cannot exceed the unity. Al-
ternatively, we have

r12| ≤
|
r02|
|

r01| ≤
|

1 and

r02 = r02 = tanh(ζ02/2) = tanh(ζ01/2 + ζ12/2)

(33)

which leads directly to the ﬁrst one of Eqs.(32).

b
On the contrary, the transmitted amplitudes composes
as a sech, whose addition law is more involved and is of
little interest for our purposes here.

Obviously, for this interface composition to be realis-
tic one cannot neglect the wave propagation between in-
terfaces. However, this is not an insuperable drawback.
Indeed, let us consider a single layer of a transparent ma-
terial of refractive index N1 and thickness d1 sandwiched
between two semi-inﬁnite media 0 and 2. Let

β1 =

N1d1 cos θ1

(34)

λ

denote the phase shift due to the propagation in the layer,
λ being the wavelength in vacuum. A standard calcula-
tion gives for the reﬂected and transmitted amplitudes
by this layer the Airy-like functions [2]

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have discussed in this paper a simple transforma-
tion that introduces remarkable simplicity and symmetry

5

in the physics of a plane interface. In these new suitable
variables the action of any interface appears in a natural
way as a hyperbolic rotation, which is the natural arena
of special relativity.

This formalism does not add any new physical ingre-
dient to the problem at hand, but allows one to obtain
previous results (like Fresnel formulas or Stokes relations)
in a particularly simple and elegant way that appears
closely related to other ﬁelds of physics.

We theoretically analyze the inﬂuence of the Gouy phase shift on the nonlinear interaction between
waves of diﬀerent frequencies. We focus on χ(2) interaction of optical ﬁelds, e.g. through birefringent
crystals, and show that focussing, stronger than suggested by the Boyd-Kleinman factor, can further
improve nonlinear processes. An increased value of 3.32 for the optimal focussing parameter for a
single pass process is found. The new value builds on the compensation of the Gouy phase shift by
a spatially varying, instead constant, wave vector phase mismatch. We analyze the single-ended,
singly resonant standing wave nonlinear cavity and show that in this case the Gouy phase shift leads
to an additional phase during backreﬂection. Our numerical simulations may explain ill-understood
experimental observations in such devices.

Nonlinear interactions of waves, in particular those of
optical ﬁelds, have opened new research areas and have
found various applications. In general, waves of diﬀerent
frequencies are coupled via nonlinear media, like bire-
fringent crystals. Examples are the production of higher
harmonics of laser radiation [1], the generation of tunable
frequencies through optical parametric oscillation [2] and
the generation of nonclassical light [3, 4] for high preci-
sion metrology [5, 6], fundamental tests of quantum me-
chanics and quantum information [7]. The eﬃciency of a
nonlinear process depends on parameters of the nonlinear
medium, and generally increases with higher intensities
of the ﬁelds involved and with better phase matching of
their wave fronts. To achieve strong nonlinear interac-
tions, pulsed laser radiation, strong focussing and, espe-
cially for continuous wave radiation, intensity build-up
in resonators are used.
In plane wave theory perfect
phase matching is achieved if the wave fronts of inter-
acting ﬁelds propagate with the same velocity. For fo-
cussed laser beams, however, this is not true because of
the well-known Gouy phase shift. This phase shift oc-
curs due to the spatial conﬁnement of a focussed wave
and generally depends on the spatial mode as well as the
frequency of the wave [8]. The inﬂuence of focussing into
a nonlinear medium has been investigated by Boyd and
Kleinman in great detail [9]. They discovered that the
eﬃciency of the nonlinear process does not monotonically
increase with decreasing focal size. They especially con-
sidered the lowest order nonlinearity that enables second
harmonic generation (SHG) and optical parametric am-
pliﬁcation (OPA) and is described by the susceptibility
χ(2), and numerically found an optimum factor between
the length of the nonlinear crystal and the Rayleigh range
of the focussed Gaussian beam for a single pass through
the crystal.

In this Letter we show that focussing stronger than
suggested by the Boyd Kleinman factor can further im-
prove nonlinear processes. We show that this eﬀect can

be understood by considering the Gouy phase shift be-
tween the interacting waves. We also show that the Gouy
phase shift results in a non-trivial phase mismatch prob-
lem in standing wave cavities.

Boyd and Kleinman have found that the maximum
nonlinear coupling between two Gaussian beams of fun-
damental (subscript 1) and second harmonic waves (sub-
script 2) is achieved for a positive wave vector phase mis-
match ∆k = 2|k1|−|k2| > 0 which increases with decreas-
ing waist size of the beam. For a single pass through a
nonlinear crystal of length L they numerically found the
optimal focussing parameter given by the relation

ξ :=

= 2.84 ,

where zR = πw2
0n/λ is the Rayleigh range of the beams
inside the crystal, and w0, n and λ are the beam’s waist
size, refractive index and wavelength, respectively. We
ﬁrst show that the Boyd-Kleinman factor according to
Eq. (1) is a consequence of maximizing the intensity of
the mean pump ﬁeld inside the nonlinear medium under
the constraint of the Gouy phase shift. In a χ(2) medium
the nonlinear interaction is described by the following set
of diﬀerential equations

∂zE0,1(z) ∝ E

where E0,1, E0,2 are the electrical ﬁelds of the fundamen-
tal and the harmonic mode in the focal center at position
z0, and ∆k = 4π/λ ∆n is the phase mismatch between
the two interacting modes. Here we use the following

where w(z) corresponds to the beam width at the posi-
tion z. In plane wave theory one ﬁnds g(z) = exp(i∆kz)
and ∆φ = 0, and equal indices of refraction for the
two interacting modes provide the maximum nonlinear-
ity. When focussing the beam into a nonlinear material
however, there is a non zero phase diﬀerence ∆φ. Since
the phase diﬀerence between a plane wave and a focussed
Gaussian beam is given by the Gouy phase shift, ∆φ
should be the diﬀerence of two such phase shifts. When
considering phase shifts between diﬀerent oscillator fre-
quencies, phases have to be frequency normalized. We
therefore introduce the Gouy phase shift normalized to
the optical frequency of mode i

where m and n describe the spatial Hermite-Gaussian
modes (TEMmn). If we now normalize ∆φ to the har-
monic frequency we ﬁnd

∆φ
ω2

= ˜φG(ω1) − ˜φG(ω2) .

(8)

We point out, that for an optimized nonlinear interaction
of Gaussian beams the Rayleigh ranges are identical for
all modes involved. In the case of frequency conversion
of a single pump ﬁeld this is automatically realized by
the nonlinear process. For the χ(2)-processes considered
in Eqs. (2)-(4) (m = n = 0) we ﬁnd

∆φ = φG .

(9)

From this one can conclude that the Gouy phase shift
leads to a nonperfect matching of the (nonplanar) phase
fronts in nonlinear processes. To quantify this eﬀect we
deﬁne the eﬀective nonlinearity κ of the process. This
quantity is proportional to the conversion eﬃciency in
SHG as well as to the optical gain of OPA. For weak
interaction, i. e. the pump ﬁeld is not depleted by the
nonlinear interaction, κ is given by

FIG. 1: (Color online) Left: For weak focussing into the non-
linear medium (ξ = 0.18) the Gouy phase shift can be com-
pensated by choosing ∆k = 1/zR, and perfect phase match-
ing can be realized over the full crystal length. Right: For
stronger focussing (ξ = 2.03) a constant ∆k can not provide
perfect phase matching. (a) Gouy phase shift ∆φ, (b) com-
pensating phase ∆kz, (c) overall phase φ0, where a constant
value describes perfect phase matching.

This quantity is maximized if the averaged ﬁeld
strength inside the crystal is maximized, i. e. if the focus
is placed in the crystal center and if the condition

∆kz + ∆φ(z) = φ0 = const.

(12)

is satisﬁed. In this case all partial waves are produced ex-
actly in phase to each other, and perfect phase matching
is realized.

Curves (a) in Fig. 1 show the diﬀerential Gouy phase
shifts ∆φ(z) = φG(z) for weak and strong focussing,
respectively. For weak focussing the gouy phase shift
evolves linearly inside the medium, and one can compen-
sate this phase mismatch by choosing ∆k = 1/zR > 0, as
found by Boyd and Kleinman [9]. For stronger focussing,
however, it is not possible to achieve perfect compensa-
tion from ∆k that is constant over the crystal. Curves (b)
show the compensating linear phase ∆kz that is due to
the propagation inside the medium and curves (c) show
the total phase φ0. The value of ∆k was chosen to pro-
vide the lowest variance of φ0 over the whole interaction
range.

We now show that it is possible to realize perfect phase
matching for an arbitrary focussing by applying the fol-
lowing position dependent index of refraction

For the calculation of the doublepass eﬀective nonlinear-

system with a nonlinear medium of length 2L with a thin
lense at position L that refocuses the beam. In this way
we obtain two waists at positions z0 and z′
0 = 2L − z0 of
size w0 indicating the way to the endmirror and the way
back, respectively. Now we integrate over 2L and ﬁnd
the following expression for the eﬀective nonlinearity for
a double pass of the fundamental Hermite-Gauss mode

This expression has the same form as the one for plane
waves as given in Eq. (17). However, an additional phase
shift appears. This phase shift is a result of spatial con-
ﬁnement and the swapping in sign of the wave front’s
radius of curvature during reﬂection, and corresponds to
minus twice the Gouy phase in the limit considered here.
From the expression of ∆ϕ′ in Eq. (20) it follows that this
additional phase jump vanishes if the waist is located ex-
actly at the back reﬂecting surface. In this case we have
plane wave fronts at the end mirror and therefore the
system is similar to a single pass through a nonlinear
medium of length 2L.

cal ﬁeld applied to the crystal could be used. The tem-
perature values on the right vertical axis constitute an
example for 7 % magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate
(MgO:LiNbO3). Data was deduced from measurements
of the nonlinear eﬃciency of crystals used in type I OPA
in [6].

Our result means that with optimum, position dependent
phase matching, the optimal waist size is approximatly
7.5 % smaller than suggested by the Boyd-Kleinman fac-
tor, and according to this, the eﬀective nonlinearity is
further increased by 4.4 %.
We now analyze if

interaction in
standing-wave cavities can be similarily improved.
Standing wave cavities, in particular in the form of a
singly-resonant, single-ended cavity, i. e. with one mir-
ror of almost perfect reﬂectivity, are frequently used in
quantum and nonlinear optics [6, 10] . In such cavities
waves that propagate in two diﬀerent directions interfere
with each other, and the diﬀerential phases introduced
by the reﬂections at the cavity mirrors have to be con-
sidered. Paschotta et al. have investigated the phase
diﬀerence ∆ϕ introduced from back reﬂection and have
suggested an appropriate design of the high reﬂectivity

the eﬀective nonlinearity for a waist position at the crys-
tal’s centre. In the latter case the best choice of the dif-
ferential phase at the back reﬂecting surface is ∆ϕ ≈ π.
This is exactly the opposite of what one might expect
from plane wave theory, where the optimum phase is
∆ϕ = 0, similar to curve (a). Trace (b) shows the ef-
fective nonlinearity for the focussing parameter that was
chosen by Paschotta et. al.

was designed to prevent a diﬀerential phase shift between
the two interacting modes and a value of ∆ϕ = 0 was
chosen. However, their experimental data revealed the
eﬀective nonlinearity to be ≈ 10 % smaller than expected
from their calculations. From our calculation it follows
that the optimum phase for their setup was ∆ϕ ≈ 1.55 π
and that the chosen value of ∆ϕ = 0 decreased the eﬀec-
tive nonlinearity to about 90 % of the maximum value.
Our considerations are therefore in excellent agreement
with experimental results given in that paper and can
solve the observed discrepancy.

In conclusion we have shown how for focussed waves
the Gouy phase shift produces nonideal phase matching
in case of ∆k = 0. For a single pass through a nonlin-
ear medium the optimum focussing parameter is found

fractive index is required to further improve the eﬀective
nonlinearity by 4.4 %. For a double pass and for cav-
ities an optimum focussing parameter above ξ = 2.84
can only be achieved with a refractive index that also de-
pends on propagation direction. We have also shown that
the Gouy phase shift eﬀects the optimum value for the
phases introduced by cavity mirrors, with a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the achievable eﬀective nonlinearity. Our theo-
retical analysis shows exact agreement with experimen-
tal data published elsewhere, and may lead to improved
quantitative descriptions of nonlinear cavities.

on the reﬂecting surface, ∆ϕ = 0 generally provides the high-
est κdp, (a) (here with strong focussing ξ = 2.84, z0 = L); the
same result is found for plane waves. Contrary, for ξ = 2.84

Fig. 3 shows the eﬀective nonlinearity versus ∆ϕ for three
diﬀerent standing wave cavity arrangements. In all cases
the second harmonic wave is not resonant but simply
back reﬂected. Curves (a) and (c) use the focussing pa-
rameter ξ = 2.84. This value optimizes the eﬀective
nonlinearity of the cavity if the refractive index of the
medium does not depend on direction of propagation of
waves. This is evident from Fig. 2 because the position
dependent refractive indices are not symmetric with re-
spect to the focal position and the back reﬂected wave
would require diﬀerent values. However, if one transfers
the results from a single pass through the medium and
realizes the required propagation direction dependent re-
fractive index the optimum focussing parameter is again

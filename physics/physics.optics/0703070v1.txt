The refractive index of novel organosilica (nano/micro)material is determined using two methods.
The ﬁrst method is based on analysis of optical extinction eﬃciency of organosilica beads versus
wavelength, which is obtained by a standard laboratory spectrometer. The second method relies
on the measurable trapping potential of these beads in the focused light beam (laser tweezers).
Polystyrene beads were used to test these methods, and the determined dispersion curves of refrac-
tive index values have been found accurate. The refractive index of organosilica beads has been
determined to range from 1.60–1.51 over the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm.

INTRODUCTION

Properties of (nano/micro)materials are shaped up
by the bulk and structural properties of their build-
ing blocks, with an example being refractive index
that determines the material’s optical characteristics.
These optical properties need to be precisely controlled
in various applications, such as sizing of organosilica
(nano/micro)beads in the ﬂow cytometry biological as-
saying. By manipulating the composition of materi-
als on the nanoscale, new structural properties have
been produced. For reliable production of desirable
(nano/micro)materials both bulk and structural proper-
ties need to be controlled. Since bulk properties of the

material can vary as a result of nanotechnological synthe-
sis, it is important to monitor them in situ. In particular,
silica-derived novel material, termed organosilica, have
been synthesized in the form of (nano/micro)spheres,
with a range of useful qualities that have been re-
ported [1, 2]. Organosilica surface activation have ap-
peared to be straightforward to bind oligonucleotide
and peptide sequences for optical encoding and high-
throughput screening via ﬂow cytometry [1, 2]. The opti-
cal encoding method, however, demands tight margins on
organosilica microspheres size and refractive index to en-
sure reliable readout and correct interpretation of their
scattering intensities in the context of ﬂow cytometry.
However, it has been noticed that the refractive index of
organosilica microspheres is highly dependent on synthe-

sis route [3] calling for a reliable refractometry method
amenable for in situ implementation. Since the organosil-
ica synthesis yields spherical particles ranging from 50
nm to 6 µm, a number of existing refractometry meth-
ods applicable for bulk materials are no longer suitable
for refractometry of this material. Among the suitable
methods, an index matching method has been reported
in a number of particle refractometry applications [3, 4].
In brief, particles in the solution do not scatter, i.e. ren-
dering the sample clear, if refractive indices of the par-
ticles and solution are matched. Therefore, the solution
refractive index read out at the sample maximum trans-
mittivity provides a measure of the refractive index of the
particle ensemble. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the
method is tedious, requiring preparation of the new so-
lution of predetermined refractive index per each experi-
mental data point. The availability of suitable solutions
with high refractive indices is usually limited.

The majority of existing refractometry methods for
particles rely on the acquisition of optical scatter data,
followed by their ﬁtting to the theoretical model from
which one can infer the particle refractive index, or its
size, or both. For example, the determination of re-
fractive index of an ensemble of microspheres have been
demonstrated using holographic method of recording of
the optical scatter [5]. The intensity of optical scatter
has been parameterized in the Rayleigh scattering model
to perform sizing of nanodiamonds [6]. Diﬀerential mi-
croscopy measurements of the optical scatter have also
permitted detection of the minute cell organelle swelling,
i.e. change in the scatterer’s size, as a result of induced
apoptosis [7].

Scattering spectroscopy provides another approach in
the determination of particle refractive index in which
characteristic particle optical extinction eﬃciency versus
wavelength is determined [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Usu-
ally, the acquired spectrum of monodisperse microsphere
samples is ﬁtted to a theoretical model with the refrac-
tive index and microsphere size as parameters. Using
this method, the refractive index for a speciﬁed wave-
length range, i.e. refractive index dispersion, can be de-
termined. The application of the scattering spectroscopy
technique to refractometry of cells, bacteria, and spores
has been also reported [4, 14, 15, 16].

In this paper, we demonstrate the application of two
refractometry methods to determine the refractive in-
dex of novel organosilica microspheres. Firstly, we re-
port application of the reﬁned scattering spectroscopy
method, where we use a commercial laboratory Lamda40
spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) to measure the re-
fractive index and dispersion of organosilica, following
well-characterized polystyrene microsphere refractome-
try. Secondly, we demonstrate application of the recently
reported method for measurement of the refractive index
for single microparticles based on optical tweezers [17].
The two methods are compared, and a very good agree-

ment is achieved.

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Materials

Organosilica spheres were produced using a two-step
process [2]. This process involved the hydrolysis and
subsequent condensation of thiol-based silica precursor.
Aqueous solutions of 5.94 µm organosilica microspheres,
with the addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate for the pre-
vention of agglomeration, were prepared for spectroscopy
measurements. Polystyrene microspheres (ProSciTech,
5.0% w/v in water) of mean diameters of 2.01, 2.09 and
5.26 µm, with a coeﬃcient of variance (CV, deﬁned as
the standard deviation divided by the mean), of less
than 2.4%, were diluted with MilliQ water. For the laser
tweezers refractometry, 2.09 µm polystyrene and 5.16 µm
organosilica microspheres were suspended in MilliQ wa-
ter. Samples were prepared by placing a drop of the sus-
pension between the microscope slide and cover slip and
sealing the chamber with high viscosity silicon grease.

Methods

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

In order to characterize the size distribution of the syn-
thesized organosilica microspheres, SEM was used. Sam-
ples were platinum coated and imaged using SEM (JEOL
JSM 6400F) with accelerating voltage of 5–10 kV. The
size distribution of the microspheres was obtained by pro-
cessing the acquired images followed by statistical anal-
ysis.

Scattering Spectroscopy

In scattering spectroscopy, spherical particle extinc-
tion eﬃciency verses illumination wavelength (hereafter
referred to as the scattering spectrum) was recorded.
Recorded data were ﬁtted to the theoretical model, where
ﬁtting parameters represented refractive index and size of
the particle. To determine the best ﬁt, the value, deﬁned
as the sum of the diﬀerence squared P (Iexp − Itheor)2,
was minimized. Although this method is simple and ef-
fective, the ﬁnal best ﬁt can be signiﬁcantly unalike. This
is due to the recording conﬁguration, which should be a
simple plane wave incident on a single spherical particle
that cast a shadow on a small-size photodetector situated
at a distance. The attenuation of the incident optical ﬂux
along the axis of incidence would be entirely due to light
scattering by the particle, or in other words, the particle

3

terial. Scans were performed at a rate of 480 nm min−1
with a spectral resolution of 2 nm. Recorded data were
digitized and transferred to a personal computer for fur-
ther processing, archiving, and display. The recorded
data were ﬁtted to the theoretical scattering spectra, as
detailed in the modelling method in Section .

Laser Tweezers Refractometry

FIG. 2: Schematic diagram of the optical tweezers refrac-
tometry for refractive index measurement of individual mi-
crospheres. A microsphere was trapped by a tightly focused
laser beam. The microsphere displacement from the centre of
the trap was detected by illuminating it with a helium-neon
laser and detecting the signal on the quadrant photodetector.
The inset shows the microsphere trapped at the centre of the
focused ﬁber laser beam.

The second refractometry method is based on laser
tweezers [17, 18]. Here, we measure the particle trapping
potential created by a high-power focused laser beam,
as shown in Fig. 2. For a particle displaced by a small
distance, ∆l, in transverse direction, the acting force,
Fα, is measured. From this, the trap stiﬀness expressed
in terms of the trap stiﬀness parameter, α,
is calcu-
lated by Fα/∆l (measured in piconewtons per nanome-
tre, pN/nm). This stiﬀness was calculated for a particle
of speciﬁed size for a range of refractive indices of the par-
ticle. From the theoretical analysis of measured results,
as described in Section we obtained the refractive index

scattered light away from the photodetector. Under typ-
ical experimental conditions, however, illumination from
an extended light source could not be regarded as the
plane wave illumination. In addition, instead of a single
particle, one has to account for an ensemble of particles,
and a ﬁnite photodetector size.

In this paper, we employed a commercial Lamda40
spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) to acquire sample ex-
tinction spectra. The sample was an aqueous suspension
of polystyrene or organosilica microspheres in a square-
proﬁle (10 mm × 10 mm) quartz cuvette. The concen-
tration of the suspension was varied (average 1.5 ± 0.6
g/L) to ensure operation in the single-scattering regime
without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Prior to
spectroscopy, every suspension was ultrasonicated for 3
minutes to ensure uniform suspension of microspheres.
To verify suspension uniformity, spectra measurements
were repeated immediately after the ﬁrst recording. Both
spectra were identical, demonstrating no particle drift
occurred during measurements. The cuvette was illumi-
nated by a light source that produced a beam spot of
approximately 1.0 × 7.5 mm2 on the front facet of the cu-
vette, and was characterized by an angular divergence of
0.4◦. A halogen lamp was used as the light source, in the
visible and near-infrared spectral range, whereas a deu-
terium lamp was used in the ultraviolet spectral range.
The illumination light source wavelength was selected
by means of three spectrally adjacent tunable diﬀraction
gratings whose operation wavelength range spanned 300
- 1100 nm. The detector was a silicon photodetector with
an area of approximately 49 mm2 calibrated for the wave-
length range used. The source to detector conﬁguration
is shown in Fig. 1.

In addition, a cuvette with pure water was placed in
the reference path of the spectrometer. Optical transmis-
sion spectra of the sample and reference were recorded
over the wavelength range of 300 - 1100 nm, and each
reference spectrum was subtracted from the sample spec-
trum to account for reﬂections, aberrations and the in-
trinsic absorption proﬁle of the solvent and cuvette ma-

of the microsphere. In order to create the optical par-
ticle trap, the beam from a continuous-wave ﬁber laser
(power 1 watt, wavelength λ = 1070 nm) was focused
to a diﬀraction-limited spot using an objective lens with
high numerical aperture of 1.3.
In order to detect the
particle position in the beam, light from a helium-neon
laser scattered by the particle was detected on a quadrant
photodetector. Alternatively, the ﬁber laser was used
both for trapping and tracking of the particle position.
In both cases, the particle displacement from the trap
centre generated a misbalanced photoelectrical signal on
the photodetector quantiﬁable by means of the electronic
signal processing [19, 20].

FIG. 3: Typical scattering spectra of microsphere suspensions
in solution. (a) Three distinct features can be observed: rip-
ples, local maxima, and a sloping curve. (b) Ripple feature of
the scattering spectra, extracted by high-pass ﬁltering.

A typical scattering spectrum [Fig.

3(a)] exhibits
three major features: ripples, local maxima, and a slop-
ing curve. The ripple represents a small-contrast high-
frequency sinusoidal signal superimposed on the large
background signal. An example of the ﬁltered ripple
structure signal is shown in Fig. 3(b). This ripple signal
is the result of interference between the incident and light
internally reﬂected within the particle. It can provide an
accurate measure of the product of microsphere diame-
ter D and refractive index nsp. It is important to note
that the ripple signal is detectable only if the sample is
monodisperse and the size parameter, x, is much greater
than 1. Otherwise, the ripple structure of the signal is
smeared and ultimately undetectable [9, 21]. The light
source and detector conﬁgurations have little eﬀect on

4

the ripple structure of the scattering spectrum.

A local maxima, in Fig. 3(a). can be explained by
the Lorenz-Mie scattering theory. In brief, it is due to
interference of the incident and diﬀracted light at the
particle-medium interface. A phase delay acquired by
the diﬀracted light depends on the particle diameter and
its relative refractive index nsp/nm , where nm is the
refractive index of the medium. By thin ﬁlm approxima-
tion and consideration of the optical path length diﬀer-
ence, the spectral separation between the maxima of the
scattering spectrum curve can be determined [11]:

∆λ = (cid:0)λ(i+1) − λi(cid:1) ≈

λ2
i
D (nsp − nm)

(1)

where i and i + 1 stand for the adjacent peaks wave-
length indices. We note that the ﬁdelity of this rela-
tionship is aﬀected by the source-detector conﬁguration.
However, in the context of our work, it provides a good
estimation of particle refractive index.

The sloping curve representing the scattering spectrum
is shown in Fig. 3(a) and is tailing towards the long wave-
length side. This curve also stems from the Lorenz–Mie
scattering theory. In brief, the optical scatter of a micro-
sphere takes the form of scattering lobes. The larger
the size parameter, the more pronounced and narrow
its forward-scattering lobe. Alternatively, the shorter
the wavelength of light incident on a sample of micro-
spheres, the less power is scattered away from the pho-
todetector, hence the greater intensity is detected. This
consideration qualitatively explains the sloping trend of
the recorded spectra, although accurate theoretical mod-
elling is needed for precise ﬁtting of experimental data to
the theory, and is beyond the scope of this paper.

In order to obtain a dispersion curve for the refractive
index, a Lorenz–Mie scattering model was used to calcu-
late the extinction cross-section of monodisperse micro-
spheres suspended in a homogeneous medium. These cal-
culations assume an incident plane wave and a inﬁnites-
imally small-size far-ﬁeld detector i.e. collection angle
of zero [22]. Refractive index dependence on the wave-
length was described by the Cauchy dispersion relation.
Its general form is given by

n (λ) = A +

B
λ2 +

C
λ4

(2)

where the Cauchy coeﬃcients A, B (µm2) and C (µm4)
are unique to the material [23]. Using an unconstrained
nonlinear optimization method implemented in Matlab,
particle size and a dispersion curve of refractive indices
over a wavelength range of 300–1100 nm were deter-
mined.

Optical tweezers refractometry

Optical tweezers refer to a technique of trapping a sin-
gle microsphere immersed in ﬂuid at the focus of a laser
beam.
It is well known that particles in ﬂuid experi-
ence random Brownian motion. For a trapped micro-
sphere, Brownian motion is suppressed, where the sup-
pression eﬃciency is a monotonic function of the optical
trap stiﬀness, α, which in turn depends on the micro-
sphere size and refractive index. Therefore, the analysis
of the Brownian motion amplitude versus the controllable
stiﬀness provides a basis for the determination of the par-
ticle refractive index. The Brownian motion amplitude is
determined by detecting the microsphere position ﬂuctu-
ation in the trap, which is analysed in terms of its power
spectrum amplitude. The roll-oﬀ frequency, f◦, of this
spectrum provides a reliable measure of the trap stiﬀness
via the following relationship [17]:

f◦ =

α
2πβ

(3)

where β is the drag coeﬃcient well tabulated for var-
ious ﬂuids. α relates to x and nsp. This dependence
has been analysed in the framework of the generalized
Lorenz-Mie theory and detailed elsewhere [17, 24, 25].
Experimental measurement of α and its comparison with
the theoretical curve of α versus nsp at a ﬁxed x, yields
the refractive index of the particle.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A low-dispersion particle sample is required for pre-
cise determination of refractive indices of microspheres by
means of scattering spectroscopy. Fig. 4 shows a typical
ensemble of organosilica microspheres imaged by SEM.
The CV of organosilica microspheres was determined to
be less than 10%, suitable for the scattering spectroscopy
measurements.

Organosilica microspheres with well controlled diam-
eters could be produced in the size range of 1–6 µm.
In Fig.
5(a), (b), and (c), recorded and calculated
spectra for 2.01 and 5.26 µm polystyrene and 5.94 µm
organosilica microsphere samples, respectively, are pre-
sented. Large size organosilica microspheres were cho-
sen to ensure the experimental spectra exhibited at least
two maxima. In the case of the monodisperse 2.01 µm
polystyrene microsphere aqueous suspension sample, the
recorded scattering spectrum was accurately ﬁtted by the
calculations using the Lorenz-Mie theory. The calcula-
tions of the dispersion of polystyrene refractive index are
presented in Fig. 6(a). The theoretical ﬁtting curve was
parameterized in terms of the Cauchy coeﬃcients (pre-
sented in Table I), which shows very good agreement with
those reported in the literature. We believe that the good

5

FIG. 4: SEM image of monodisperse organosilica micro-
spheres

agreement between the experimental and theoretical data
was due to the relatively small sphere size, which forward-
scattered incident light over wide angles. The evaluation
of the 2.01 µm polystyrene sphere scattering showed that
the forward-scattering lobe overﬁlled the area of the pho-
todetector for λ ≤ 390 nm, as illustrated in the Fig. 6(a)
inset. This qualitative model also explains the discrep-
ancy between theoretical and experimental data at λ ≤
390 nm, where the next side-lobe incident on the detector
interferes constructively with the original incident plane
wave, unlike the forward-scattering lobe which interferes
destructively (which is why extinction in the forward di-
rection occurs). Therefore, the extinction is reduced in
comparison with that calculated in the small photode-
tector approximation. Alternatively, one can view this
in terms of the size parameter x. In Fig 5(a), the intro-
duction of the second side-lobe can be observed at an x
value of 17. The eﬀect of multiple side-lobe interference
is much more pronounced in the case of the scattering
spectrum of 5.26 µm polystyrene microspheres, shown in
Fig. 5(b), and 5.94 µm organosilica microspheres, shown
in Fig. 5(c). Here, the maximum x values are 15 and
17. The insets of Fig. 5(a) and (b) illustrate the detec-
tion scenarios for 2.01 and 5.26 µm polystyrene sphere
aqueous suspension, respectively. Obviously, reducing
the detector size can avoid the collection of the side-
scattering lobe. However, commercially available spec-
trometers have relatively large size detectors, which are
designed to maximize detection sensitivity.

For an accurate theoretical model, which will result in
precise ﬁtting of measured data, a ﬁnite detector must
be accounted for. However, this will require more com-
plex Mie theory calculations and enormous computing
power. Therefore to obtain maintain the simplicity of
this method, we employ high pass ﬁltering to isolate the
ripple signal from the sloping curve of the recorded spec-

tion, was not accounted for in our modelling method.
The eﬀect of multiple scattering has been shown, in liter-
ature, to increase with optical depth (concentration) and
gradually smoothes out the maxima and minima [27].
The spectra of solutions with increasing concentrations
were recorded, and did not exhibit the eﬀects of multi-
ple scattering, which were observed in the work of Cohen
(1975).

The refractive index of the microspheres was also
measured using optical tweezers refractometry. This
method did not require monodisperse suspensions since
only a single particle was measured at a time. For 2.09
µm polystyrene and 5.16 µm organosilica microspheres,
the power spectrum amplitude of Brownian motion,
shown in Fig. , was recorded, and the roll-oﬀ frequencies
determined. Using Eq. (2) and tabulated drag constants,
the trap stiﬀness was calculated, and is shown in Table
II. By using experimentally measured diameters of
the trapped polystyrene and organosilica microspheres
we calculated α versus nsp in the framework of the
Lorenz-Mie scattering theory, with the results presented
in Fig. 8. The intersection of the theoretical curves and
corresponding horizontal lines of the determined values
of α yielded the refractive index of the trapped mi-
crospheres. For polystyrene microspheres, we obtained
a refractive index of nsp = 1.58 ± 0.01 at λ = 1070
nm. This value deviates by a 0.6% from that given in
literature [13]. For the organosilica microspheres, we
obtained refractive indices of 1.52 ± 0.01 and 1.51 ±
0.01 at 589 and 1070 nm respectively, which was in a
good agreement with the respective values of 1.518 and
1.511 obtained by the scattering spectroscopy method.
For comparison with the scattering spectroscopy results,
the refractive index values obtained by laser tweezers
refractometry are also shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b).

tra. The results are presented in Fig. 5(a′) and (b′) for
2.01 and 5.26 µm polystyrene microspheres, respectively.
For the 5.26 µm polystyrene sample, we used the ripple
signal to determine the refractive index dispersion rela-
tionship, provided an independent measurement of the
particle size could be made. For the organosilica micro-
spheres, the ripple structure was not observable due to
relatively large CV value. Therefore, we used the local
maxima to determine their refractive index. The max-
imum was isolated by a high-pass ﬁlter to suppress the
sloping feature of the recorded spectrum. The resultant
spectrum is shown in Fig. 3(c′), and displays a reason-
able agreement with the theoretical scatter spectrum.

CONCLUSIONS

The refractive index of organosilica microspheres was
determined in the 300–1100 nm wavelength range using
laser tweezers refractometry and a relatively simple scat-
tering spectroscopy technique. The refractive index of
organosilica has been found to range from 1.60–1.51 over
the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm, which is consider-
ably greater than that of the organosilica substrate, fused
silica. The development of the refractometry methods
addressed in this paper can be useful for accurate deter-
mination of nano(micro)material refractive index in situ,
whereas the tabulation of refractive index of organosil-
ica microspheres has important applications to biological
screening using ﬂow cytometry.

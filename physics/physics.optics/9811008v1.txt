We present a new class of micro lasers based on nanoporous molecular sieve host-guest systems.
Organic dye guest molecules of 1-Ethyl-4-(4-(p-Dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-butadienyl)-pyridinium
Perchlorat were inserted into the 0.73-nm-wide channel pores of a zeolite AlPO4-5 host. The zeolitic
micro crystal compounds where hydrothermally synthesized according to a particular host-guest
chemical process. The dye molecules are found not only to be aligned along the host channel axis,
but to be oriented as well. Single mode laser emission at 687 nm was obtained from a whispering
gallery mode oscillating in a 8-µm-diameter monolithic micro resonator, in which the ﬁeld is conﬁned
by total internal reﬂection at the natural hexagonal boundaries inside the zeolitic microcrystals.

Structures of optical wavelength scale such as micro
resonators and micro lasers are presently attracting con-
siderable attention in quantum optics, laser physics, ma-
terials science, and device technology. The reduction of
at least one lateral dimension of a laser structure down to
the order of one wavelength modiﬁes the mode density of
the optical ﬁeld inside the laser resonator which in turns
modiﬁes the spontaneous emission rate [1]. As a result,
the light generation eﬃciency in wavelength–scale micro
In addition, the cavity
lasers is expected to increase.
quantum electrodynamic eﬀects that are predicted to ap-
pear in this regime can be exploited to accomplish novel
functions [2,3].

From an experimental point of view, reducing the size
of a laser necessitates that careful attention be given to
the scaling laws of the two basic parameters gain and
losses. On one hand the gain of the light propagating in
the laser structure scales in general with the propagation
length, as do the scattering losses in the medium. On
the other hand, the coupling losses from the inside to the
outside of the laser structure do not depend on geometri-
cal factors. Consequently, even for laser media with very
low scattering losses, scaling down to the size of a few
wavelengths becomes diﬃcult because the reduced gain
can no longer compensate for the coupling losses. Up to
now, laser size reduction down to a few ten micrometers
has been sucessfully carried out for media with high gain,
such as semiconductors (vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers, microdisk [2,4], or spherical lasers [5]), and sper-
ical liquid [6], or polymer dissolved dyes [7,8], as well
as solid state spheres [9]. Thus, realizing wavelength
scale lasers based on alternative materials, geometries,
and emission wavelengths is still a challenging experi-
mental task. As a reward, in addition to a gain in their

basic understanding, one can imagine many practical ap-
plications for microlasers, e.g. as eﬃcient luminophores,
or as bright lasing pixels for displays [10].

In this letter, we report the ﬁrst realization of a new
class of solid state micro lasers based on a host-guest
composite material. In contrast to conventional gain ma-
terials, in which the active centers are not systematically
ordered on the microscopic level, the regular crystallo-
graphic matrix of cavities in a zeolite crystal maintains
the laser active organic guest molecules aligned and ori-
ented.
In fact, the aluminosilicate structure of zeolitic
crystals surrounds regularly arranged cavities or channels
with a size of up to ca. 1×10−9 m [11,12]. It is this frame-
work of crystallographically arranged nanometer cavities
that has stimulated physicists, chemists, and materials
scientists to investigate guest-host modiﬁcations of the
host material on the nanometer scale, with the objec-
tive of tailoring the properties of the composite on the
macroscopic scale. For example, Bogomolov et al. [13]
synthesized nanocomposites of semiconductor based clus-
ters in zeolites and superconducting quantum wires [14],
whereas Cox et al. [15] presented a concept for the mod-
iﬁcation of the nonlinear optical response of molecular
sieve materials. Further applications based on the inclu-
sion concept were proposed, cf. e.g. [16–18]. For optical
functions, the inclusion ansatz was ﬁrst successively em-
bodied by Cox et al. [19]. The group of Caro and Marlow
[20] also transformed various AlPO and SAPO molecular
sieves into a nonlinear material for optical frequency con-
version by inclusion of the noncentrosymmetric organic
molecule p-nitroaniline, and Bredol et al. [21] included
eﬃcient luminophores in zeolites.

The framework of the hexagonal (P 6

m cc) AlPO4-5
crystals discussed here consists of a one-dimensional

1

system of pores (channels) 0.73 nm wide. Guided
mainly by geometrical considerations we selected the
dye molecule 1-Ethyl-4-(4-(p-Dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-
butadienyl)-pyridinium Perchlorat (Pyridine 2) [22] as lu-
minescent activator center. With a width of ca. 0.6 nm
(calculated with the code SHELXTL) it ﬁts into the one-
dimensional channel framework of the zeolite AlPO4-5
[23]; cf. ﬁg. 1.

zeolite AlPO4-5,

its one dimen-
sional channel framework, and the inserted dye molecule
1-Ethyl-4-(4-(p-Dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-butadienyl)-pyri-
dinium Perchlorat (Pyridine 2).

The dye molecules were brought into the pores by in
situ inclusion of the organic dyes during the synthesis
[24], a method pioneered by the group of Schulz-Ekloﬀ
and W¨ohrle [25]. The compound was hydrothermally
synthesized as described in ref. [26]. An ice cold solu-
tion of triethylamine, phosphoric acid, Pyridine 2, and
water was added under stirring over 10 min to an alu-
minumoxidehydroxide suspension prepared as described
in [27]. The mixture was stirred for another 20 min, and
ﬁlled into a Teﬂon lined autoclave, which then was placed
in an oven preheated to 210◦C. Usually, after short reac-
tion times of ca. 1 h, one obtains mostly regularly shaped
hexagonal prisms, whereas longer reaction times lead
preferentially to dumbbell shaped crystals where the pris-
matic center bar splits oﬀ into a fascicle–like ensemble of
diverging prismatic needles; cf. ﬁg. 3(b). These crystals
are characterized by the regular shape of their prismatic
central part, which with a width of about 8 µm, can act
as a laser resonator (ﬁg. 3(c)). The color distribution ob-
served in the light microscope indicates that the dye con-
centrates in this central part, whereas the fascicled end
parts appear colorless, implying a low dye content. Con-
sequently, laser action was observed in the prismatic cen-
tral region of the dumbbell shaped crystals. Whichever
the crystal shape, X-ray powder diﬀractograms reveal no
indication for the presence of any crystallographic phase
other than (P 6
m cc)–AlPO4-5. After the desired reaction
time, the autoclaves are quench cooled, the crystals ﬁl-
tered out, rinsed with water, and dried. Their reﬂuxing
in ethanol did not reveal any extraction of dye inclu-
sions. Syntheses with dye concentrations between 0.1%-
mass and 0.01%-mass were realized.

The long axis of the Pyridine 2 dye guest molecules

2

lines up along the channel pores of the AlPO4-5 host, re-
sulting in a composite with strong macroscopic dichroic
properties. The crystal appears dark red or transparent
depending on the direction of the polarization vector of
the incident light with respect to the channel direction.
Furthermore, the Pyridine 2 molecule is an electron push-
pull-system carrying an electric dipole moment along its
axis. A priori, inclusion into the channel pores can oc-
cur with the dipole moments all aligned in parallel, or
with alternating antiparallel orientation. In the ﬁrst case
the dipole moments add to a static macroscopic moment,
whereas in the latter case the net macroscopic moment
vanishes. Our investigations of single crystal individuums
revealed that with the inclusion of Pyridine-2 dyes, the
AlPO crystals acquire pyroelectrical properties, implying
the presence of a macroscopic moment. Thus, in contrast
with the random orientation of the dye molecules in liq-
uid or polymeric laser media, the dye molecules in the
zeolite solid state system are not only aligned but in av-
erage are oriented as well.

The samples are optically pumped with the second har-
monic of a Q-switch Nd:YAG-laser (λ = 532 nm, 10 ns
pulse length, 10 Hz rep. rate). The excited ﬂuorescence
light was collected with a microscope objective (numer-
ical aperture NA = 0.35). Behind the sample the pump
light was warded oﬀ with a 3 mm Schott RG 610 ﬁlter.
The imaging magniﬁcation of the sample on the CCD-
chip of the cooled imaging camera (Photometrics CH250
running at -20◦C) was 55×.
In order to increase the
light collection eﬃciency without perturbing the imag-
ing properties of the spectrometer (ORIEL MS 257 with
600 L/mm, 400 nm blaze wavelength grating, and In-
staSpec IV detector, slit width ca. 150 µm), the mag-
niﬁcation perpendicular to the entrance slit was, when
needed, reduced to ca. 5× with a cylindrical lens. Imag-
ing camera and the spectrometer were carefully aligned
to collect and display the ﬂuorescence signals originat-
ing from the very same sample area. Pari passu, the
data acquisition time window of the spectrometer was
synchronized with the camera acquisition cycle. In sum-
mary, we made certain that the captured spectra could
be uniquely associated in space as well as in time with
the images acquired by the camera. With this technique
we analyzed samples in a heap, as well as isolated single
individual crystals.

To prevent intersystem crossing processes (energy
transfer to nonluminescent,
long living triplet states)
quenching the ﬂuorescence, the system is pumped with
10 ns pulses. The oriented inclusion of the dye molecules
results in a strongly polarized ﬂuorescence emission. The
ﬂuorescence distribution of the microcrystal individuals
investigated peaks at ca. 685 nm and exhibits a FWHM of
ca. 85 nm. When the pulse energy used to pump a num-
ber of clumped microcrystals (> 100) is increased above
a certain threshold, we observe the sudden appearance
of strong spectral spikes around the ﬂuorescence maxi-

mum. The spikes exhibit an instrument limited width of
ca. 0.6 nm and a spacing of ca. 4 nm. With increasing
pump energy, the spikes grow at a faster rate than the
ﬂuorescence shoulder, as illustrated in ﬁg. 2.

FIG. 2. Ratio of the height of a spectral peak above shoul-
der to the ﬂuorescence shoulder height as a function of the en-
ergy of the unfocused laser pulses (DLaser = 1.2 mm) pump-
ing an ensemble of crystal samples. The diagram reveals the
presence of a threshold and an overproportional growth for
the spectral spike intensity. Shown in the insets are typical
spectra below and above threshold (not scaled). Note that as
the laser emission (spectral spikes) is strongly directed, not
all the emitted laser light from the samples is collected by the
spectrometer aperture.

The presence of a threshold energy together with the
rapid intensity increase with pump power are signatures
of the stimulated emission processes occuring in a laser.
Note that in ﬁg. 2 the contribution of the collected ﬂu-
orescence light originates from a heap of microcrystals
imaged to ﬁll the entrance slit area, whereas the contri-
butions to the spectral peaks originate in small localized
spots, as will be shown below. Thus, the peak to shoul-
der ratio corresponding to a single localized laser emitter
is grossly underestimated in ﬁg. 2.

Inspection of individual crystals revealed that only
samples with a dumbbell-like shape show laser emission,
most of them oscillating on several spectral lines. How-
ever, a number of speciﬁc individuals were found to emit
a single line. A typical example is shown in ﬁg. 3 with its
emission spectrum (a) and the corresponding SEM (b)
and optical (d) micrographs. As seen on ﬁg. 3(d), the
strong part of the ﬂuorescence activity is concentrated
in the prismatic central section of the dumbbell sample
within a 3 - 4 µm wide slice. This is compatible with
the distribution of the dye concentration visible as red
coloration when inspecting the sample with the light mi-
croscope. As a consequence, this strong concentration
of dyes, and thus gain, in a thin slice can conﬁne the
oscillating ﬁeld through gain guiding. Superimposed to

3

the below threshold luminescence image are the local-
ized spots, from where the strong laser lines were emit-
ted. Figure 3(e) shows the spectral distribution of the
emission as a function of the image height. We see that
the strong, narrow line emission emerges from a posi-
tion which is consistent with the spots of strong emis-
sion shown in the micrograph ﬁg. 3(d). As already men-
tioned, the luminescence is linearly polarized parallel to
the crystal axis because of the orientation of the molecu-
lar polarizability of the included dye molecules. For this
reason, luminescence emission, and thus also any stimu-
lated emission, in the direction of the crystal axis are not
possible. Therefore, light ampliﬁcation can only occur
for waves travelling in planes normal to the crystal axis.
In fact, there exist a wide range of wavevectors paral-
lel to the high gain slice, which fulﬁll the conditions for
total internal reﬂection (TIR) at the prism faces. The
faces of the prism therefore form the mirrors of an op-
tical ring resonator in which the necessary feedback for
laser action is provided; cf. ﬁg. 3(c). The optical mode
oscillating in this ring resonator resembles a whispering
gallery mode. Whispering gallery modes were extensively
discussed [2,3,28], and as mentioned at the beginning, las-
ing was observed in diﬀerent geometries. In our case the
mode is conﬁned by the prism faces and by gain guiding
in a 3 - 4 µm thick disk. We estimate the gain induced
index increase to ca. 10−3, suﬃcient to conﬁne the ﬁeld
[29]. Together with the narrow width of the gain re-
gion this leads to single frequency oscillation. In fact, in
samples in which the dye was contained in wider disks,
multiline emission was observed. The lasing threshold
for single microlasers was around 12 × 10−9 J pump en-
ergy falling upon the ca. 200 (µm)3 volume enclosing the
lasing mode (dye concentration ca. 0.05%-mass). In an
ideal whispering gallery mode only minuscule amounts of
diﬀracted light will leave the resonator [30]. In the sam-
ple shown, laser light is outcoupled at small defects at the
crystal surface which disturb the TIR; cf. the hot spots
in ﬁg. 3(d). The roundtrip length for the light circulating
in this ring resonator is about ℓ ≈ 25 µm, correspond-
ing to a longitudinal mode separation ∆λ = λ2/nℓ of
ca. 13 nm. This is more than three times the spectral line
spacing observed in crystals exhibiting multi–spike emis-
sion. We suspect that these lines correspond to diﬀerent
morphology dependent structure modes, anologuous to
those observed in spherical lasers [6].

Although we did not systematically investigate size de-
pendent eﬀects yet, we have demonstrated laser emission
in composite material microlasers with a resonator size
in the regime where size dependent eﬀects such as re-
duction of laser threshold [1,31] start to play a role. To
our knowledge the microlasers presented here are ca. 3×
smaller than the smallest dye lasers realized so far [7]. In
addition, the dye molecules are uniformly aligned in the
zeolitic solid state host. In this system, we also observed
ﬂuorescence emission (yet not laser emission) excited by

two photon absorption of 1064 nm laser light as well as
frequency conversion of the 1064 nm excitation to

(e) On the spectrometer input the horizontal image magniﬁcation is reduced with an anamorphotic-like imaging system so
that the whole crystal length can pass through the entrance slit. The imaging properties of the spectrometer allow to spacially
resolve the light distribution along the entrance slit. The ﬁgure shows the spectrum along the entrance slit (scale matched
to the ﬁgure at left), where the irradiance is rendered in grey levels. The strong laser emission peak at 687 nm exceeds the
dynamic range spanned by the grey scale and is therefore coded with black pixels. It is clearly shown that the laser emission
emerges from regions corresponding to the black coded spots in (d).

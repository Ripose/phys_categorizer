Image transmission through a stable paraxial cavity

We study the transmission of a monochromatic ”image” through a paraxial cavity. Using the
formalism of self-transform functions, we show that a transverse degenerate cavity transmits the self-
transform part of the image, with respect to the ﬁeld transformation over one round-trip of the cavity.
This formalism gives a new insight on the understanding of the behavior of a transverse degenerate
cavity, complementary to the transverse mode picture. An experiment of image transmission through
a hemiconfocal cavity show the interest of this approach.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Image transmission and propagation in a paraxial sys-
tem, using optical devices such as lenses and mirrors is
a well-known and extensively studied problem [1]. The
free-propagation of a ﬁeld changes its transverse distri-
bution, but in some planes, such as conjugate planes,
or Fourier plane, one get simple transformations of the
image. On the other hand, transmission through cav-
ity has a drastic eﬀect on the transverse distribution of
the ﬁeld, as one must take into account the transverse
characteristics and the resonances of the cavities. Opti-
cal cavities have also been studied extensively for a long
time, starting from the Fabry-Perot resonator, then to
the laser[2], and their are commonly used as temporal
frequency ﬁlters. Less known are their spatial frequency
ﬁlter properties. An optical cavity is associated to an
eigenmode basis, i.e. a family of modes (like T EMpq
hermite gaussian modes) which superimpose onto them-
selves after a round-trip inside the cavity. This basis
depends on the geometrical characteristics of the cavity
(length, curvature of the mirrors, ...). Only eigenmodes
can be transmitted through the cavity at resonance and
the cavity acts both as a spatial ﬁlter and frequency ﬁl-
ter. This mode selection property of cavities, that does
not exist in free propagation, is well-known in the lon-
gitudinal domain for frequency ﬁltering. However, the
general transverse eﬀect of a cavity on an image has,
to the authors’ knowledge, never been carefully investi-
gated. Whereas the transmission of an image through a
cavity which is only resonant for one transverse mode is
well-known to be completely destructive for this image,
some particular cavities called transverse degenerate cav-
ities can partially transmit an image, in a way that we
will precise in the present paper.

This work is part of a more general study on quan-
tum eﬀects in optical images [3, 4] and more precisely
on noiseless parametric image ampliﬁcation [5, 6], per-
formed in the continuous-wave regime. In order to have
a signiﬁcant parametric gain with low-power laser, we
need resonant optical cavities, operating in the regenera-
tive ampliﬁer regime, below, but close to, the oscillation

threshold [7]. As a ﬁrst step, we therefore need to pre-
cisely assess the imaging properties of an empty optical
cavity. This study turns out to be interesting in itself,
and might also be useful for other experiments.

We begin this paper by reminding in section II some
useful features of paraxial propagation of an image and
of degenerate cavities. In section III, we develop a new
formalism to understand the transmission of an image
through a paraxial cavity, and link it to the formalism
of cyclic transforms. In section IV, we show simulations
and experimental results of image transmission through
a simple degenerate cavity : the hemi-confocal cavity.

II. ”ABCD” CAVITY ROUND-TRIP MATRIX
TRANSFORMS

All the theory developed in this paper will be per-
formed within the paraxial approximation. We consider a
monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld E(~r,t) at frequency
ω, linearly polarized along a vector ~u and propagating
along a direction z of space. The position in the trans-
verse plane will be represented by the vector ~r = x~i + y~j.
The electric ﬁeld is supposed stationary and can be writ-
ten in a given transverse plane as :

~E (~r, t) = Re[E (~r) e−iωt~u]

where ~u is the polarization unit vector. The local inten-
sity in this plane is then :

I (~r) = 2ǫ0cE (~r) E∗ (~r) .

The input image considered all along this paper is de-
ﬁned by a given transverse repartition of the complex
transverse ﬁeld Ein(~r) in an input plane zin. We sup-
pose that its extension is ﬁnite around the optical axis,
and that its transverse variations are such that this im-
age propagates within the paraxial approximation. We
will consider both intensity images and ”ﬁeld” images, i.e.
not only the transverse intensity distribution of the ﬁeld,
but also the amplitude distribution itself.

Image propagation in a paraxial system

∗Electronic address: gigan@spectro.jussieu.fr

The ﬁeld E(~r) is propagating through an optical sys-
tem along the z axis. An input-output relation of the

form can be written :

Eout (~r) =

[Ein (~r)]

T

(3)

where Ein(~r) and Ein(~r) are the ﬁelds just before and
just after the optical system and
is the transformation
of the ﬁeld associated to the optical system. If the sys-
tem is only a linear paraxial system (made of lenses, or
curved mirrors, but without diaphragms), the propaga-
tion properties of the system are described by its Gauss
matrix T (often called ABCD matrix) which writes :

T

T =

A B
C D

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

All the properties of the system can be inferred from
the values of the coeﬃcients A, B, C and D, and of the
total optical length L of the system (responsible for a
phase factor which is not included in the ABCD coeﬃ-
cients). We will assume that the index of refraction is
the same at the input and at the output of the system.
BC = 1. In
As a consequence, we have det(T ) = AD

In terms of imaging, a conjugate plane corresponds to
a transformation for which one retrieves the input image
within a magniﬁcation factor M. From equations (5) and
(6), it can be inferred that:

•

if B = 0 one retrieves the intensity image but not
the amplitude (there is a phase curvature coming

ikCM~r2
2
2

from the term e
of equation (6)). We will call
such a transform an ”Intensity-Conjugate Trans-
form”, or ICT.

•

if B = 0 and C = 0 one retrieves the amplitude im-
age (and the intensity image of course). We will call
such a transform an ”Amplitude-Conjugate Trans-
form”, or ACT. This transform is sometimes also
called a Near-Field (NF).

Another interesting transformation is the one for which
one obtains the spatial Fourier transform of the image.
Still from equations (5) and (6), one sees that:

2

•

if A = 0 one obtains the Fourier transform for the
ﬁeld, within a curvature phase term corresponding

−iπD~r2
2
Bλ

to the factor e
of equation (5)). This factor
does not aﬀect the intensity distribution. We will
call this transformation a ”Intensity Fourier Trans-
form”, or IFT.

•

if A = 0 and D = 0 one obtains a perfect spa-
tial Fourier transform for the amplitude ﬁeld. We
will call this transformation an ”Amplitude Fourier
Transform”, or AFT. It is sometimes called a far-
ﬁeld (FF).

(4)

It is straightforward to see that a 2f-2f system (a lens
of focal distance f placed before and after a distance
2f ) performs an ACT, and that a f-f system performs an
AFT. Whereas AFT and ACT can be simply and directly
juxtaposed side-by side, this is not the case for IFT and
ICT transformations because of the phase factors.

Let us remind a few obvious facts, which will be
nonetheless useful to understand the rest of the discus-
sion. Two length scales have to be considered for the
optical system length L : The ”rough length”, important
to understand propagation (diﬀraction) eﬀects, and the
”exact length”, which must be known on the scale of λ,
necessary to determine the exact phase of the ﬁeld.

B. Transverse degeneracy of a resonator

For simplicity purposes, all our discussion about cavi-
ties will be restricted to the case of linear optical cavities
with two spherical mirrors. Its extension of the discussion
to more complex cases (ring cavity, cylindrical mirrors,
etc...) is straightforward. We also assume that the trans-
verse extension of the ﬁeld is not limited by the size of the
mirrors. In this simple case the cavity is fully described
by its round-trip Gauss matrix Tcav, starting from a given
reference plane.

|

We consider here only geometrically stable cavities
(
> 2). In this case, the eigenmodes of the de-
A + D
|
vice are the Hermite-Gauss modes (HG) adapted to the
cavity, i.e having wavefront coinciding with the mirror
surfaces. The normalized transverse electric ﬁeld in the
T EMmn mode basis is given by:

w0 is the waist of the T EM00 mode of the cavity taken
in its focal plane, of coordinate z = 0, and q is the com-
plex radius of curvature. It is important to note that q
is independent from m and n, and only depends on the
position and size of the waist. Finally, Ψ(z), the Gouy
phase-shift, will play a major role in this discussion.

Let us note z1 and z2 the mirror positions and L =
z2 −
z1 the total length of the cavity. The resonant cavity
eigenmodes will be the HG modes Amn having a total
round-trip phase-shift is equal to 2p′π, with p′ integer. If
the input ﬁeld has a ﬁxed wavelength λ, this will occur
only for a comb of cavity length values Lmnp′ given by:

(11)

This simple relation has been shown in [8] for a linear
cavity with two curved mirrors. We give in the appendix
a demonstration of this result valid for any stable paraxial
cavity.

A cavity is called ”transverse degenerate” when for
a given frequency and cavity length, several transverse
modes are simultaneously resonant. From equation (9),
we can see that:

•

there is a natural degeneracy for HG modes giving
the same value to s = m + n, related to the cylin-
drical symmetry of the device. We will not consider
this natural degeneracy any longer, and call s the
transverse mode order and p the longitudinal mode
order;

•

the cavity is transverse degenerate when α is a ra-
tional fraction of 2π. Let us write α/2π as an irre-
ducible fraction:

α = 2π

[2π].

N < 1. K/N is called

As the degeneracy order is the remainder part of the
total Gouy phase-shift over one turn of the cavity, we
conclude that there exists an inﬁnite number of cavity
conﬁgurations with the same degeneracy order. Further-
more, the rational fraction ensemble being dense in R,
transverse degenerate cavities is a dense ensemble among
all the possible cavities.

Let us ﬁrst consider the comb of cavity resonant

lengths (see ﬁgure (1)). Rewriting equation (9) as:

Lsp =

(N p + K(s + 1)) .

where p is an integer. One sees that whereas the free
spectral range of the cavity for longitudinal modes (p
periodicity) remains equal to the usual value λ/2, the
natural unit to describe the comb is λ
2N . N and K appear
than as the steps, in this natural unit, for the longitudinal
comb (when ﬁxing s) and for the transverse comb (when
ﬁxing p). Within a free spectral range, there exist N
lengths for which the teeth of the comb coincide, allowing
us to deﬁne N families of modes.

Let us now consider the cavity in terms of rays optics.

where I2 is the identity matrix of size 2

means that any incoming ray will retrace back onto itself
after N round-trips, forming a closed trajectory, or orbit.
The total phase accumulated on such an orbit is 2Kπ (as
can be seen on equation (11).

F ≃

Up to now, only perfect Fabry-Perot resonators have
been considered. If one consider a cavity with a given
2π
ﬁnesse
γ where γ is the energy loss coeﬃcient over
one round-trip, supposed small, then F
2π is the mean num-
ber of round-trip of the energy in the cavity before it es-
capes. As a consequence, for a given ﬁnesse, and a cavity
with a degeneracy order of K/N , we have to compare
F
to N . If the ﬁnesse is low (i.e.
N ) then light will
escape before retracing its path and the previous discus-
sion is not relevant. In the rest of the discussion we will
then stay in the high ﬁnesse limit (

F ≪

N ).

We now have all the tools necessary to study the prop-

F ≫

agation of a paraxial image in a stable resonant cavity.

IMAGE TRANSMISSION THROUGH A

We will consider for simplicity sake an impedance
matched cavity, where the input and output mirror have
the same reﬂectivity and no other losses exist in the cav-
ity, so that at exact resonance a mode is transmitted with

ﬁne the input image as the transverse ﬁeld conﬁguration
Ein(~r) at a chosen plane before the cavity. We want to
image it on a detection plane after the cavity. After prop-
agation along a ﬁrst paraxial system corresponding to an
ACT of magniﬁcation equal to 1, Ein(~r) is transformed
into its near ﬁeld at a given reference plane inside the
cavity (position zref ). After propagation along a second
identical paraxial system, a new near ﬁeld (output image)
is obtained with unity magniﬁcation after the cavity on a
detection plane (a CCD for instance). As the three planes
are perfectly imaged on each other, we will use the same
notation ~r for these three transverse coordinates, and we
will omit the z coordinate.

Let am,n be the projection of the image on the mode

The eﬀect of the cavity on the image can be understood
as a complex transmission tm,n on each mode Am,n, de-
pending on the length and geometry of the cavity. The

Let us consider a single mode cavity having a length
L chosen so that only the T EM00 resonates. The trans-
mission function of the cavity is :

tm,n = δm0δn0

(18)

and the output image is:

Eout (~r, t) =

tm,nam,nAm,n(~r) = a0,0A0,0(~r)

All the transverse information about the input image Ein
is then lost when passing through the cavity. In such a
single mode-cavity, the Gouy phase-shift α/2π is not a ra-
tional fraction, so that whatever N , T N
= I2. In terms
of geometrical optics, this means that no ray (except the
ray on the optical axis) ever retraces its path on itself.
This is the usual understanding of the eﬀect of a cavity
on an image, where the image is completely destroyed.

cav 6

In general the precise length of the resonator is con-
trolled through a piezo-electric transducer. If the single-
mode cavity length is scanned over one free spectral
range, every Laguerre-Gauss cavity eigenmode will be
transmitted one after the other. The intensity ﬁeld aver-
aged over time on a CCD will be, at a given transverse

B. Planar cavity

It is important to study the planar cavity, since it is
both widely used experimentally and often taken as a
model cavity in theoretical works. Let us consider a pla-
nar cavity of length L. The Gauss matrix is :

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(21)

It does not fulﬁll condition (14) for any N value, and is
therefore not degenerate. Strictly speaking, the planar
cavity is not a paraxial cavity, even for rays making a
small angle β with the cavity axis, which escape from
the axis after a great number of reﬂections. As a con-
sequence, there is no gaussian basis adapted to this cav-
ity. The planar cavity eigenmodes are the tilted plane
waves eik(β1x+β2y), which are not degenerate since they
resonate for diﬀerent lengths: L = p λ
2 /2).
For a given length the cavity selects a cone of plane waves
with a given value of β2
2 . The planar cavity is there-
fore not an imaging cavity. However, given a detail size,
if the ﬁnesse is low enough and the cavity short enough
for the diﬀraction to be negligible, then the image can
be roughly transmitted. This study is again outside the
scope of this paper.

C. Totally degenerate cavity

Let us now consider a completely degenerate paraxial
cavity, in which all the transverse modes are resonant for
the same cavity length. As a consequence the transmis-
sion function of this cavity brought to resonance is:

tm,n = 1

(22)

and the output ﬁeld will be:

Eout (~r) =

tm,nam,num,n(~r) = Ein (~r) .

Its Gauss matrix is Tcav = I2, its degeneracy order
is 1: every input ray will retrace its path after a single
round-trip. A completely degenerate cavity can be called
self-imaging. Examples of self imaging cavities have been
described in[9].

D.

cavity of degeneracy order K/N

Let us now study the propagation of an image through
a transverse degenerate cavity with degeneracy order
K/N . We will use a formalism of self-transform func-
tion, that we introduce in the next subsection.

1. Cyclic transforms

Some functions are there own Fourier transform. They

verify:

5

(24)

˜f (u) = f (u)

+∞

−∞

Z

where the Fourier transform ˜f is deﬁned by:

˜f (u) =

f (x)e2πiuxdx.

(25)

f (x) = αe−πx2

Two well known examples are the gaussian functions
and the inﬁnite dirac comb f (x) =
n). These functions are called Self-Fourier func-
tions or SFFs. Caola[10] showed that for any function
P
g(x), then f deﬁned as:

n δ(x

−

f (x) = g(x) + g(

x) + ˜g(x) + ˜g(

x)

(26)

is a SFF. Lohmann and Mendlovic[12] showed later that
this construction method for a SFF (equation (26)) is
not only suﬃcient but necessary. Any SFF f (x) can be
generated through equation (26) from another function
g(x). Lipson [11] remarked that such distributions should
exist in the middle of a confocal resonator. Lohmann [15]
also studied how such states could be used to enhance the
resolution in imaging.

It is straightforward to generalize this approach to a N-
cyclic transform. A transform
TC is said to be N-cyclic

transform function FS of
TC can be generated in this
manner (take g = FS/N for instance). The Fourier trans-
form is 4-cyclic. Other cyclic transforms and associated
self-transform functions are studied in [11, 13, 14].

We will show here that degenerate cavities pro-
duce such self-transform functions from an input image
through a transformation similar to equation (27).

2.

Image propagation through a K/N degenerate cavity

Let us consider a resonator cavity with order of degen-
eracy K/N . Let γ be the (low) intensity losses over one
round trip on the mirrors. For an impedance-matched
cavity without internal losses, the losses are identical on

the two mirrors, meaning that the amplitude transmis-
γ
sion of one mirror is t =

be extended to more complex cavities, provided
cyclic transform, and that the present formalism holds for
single-mode or totally degenerate cavities: in the former
case it means that a self-transform function for a non-
cyclic transform is just a cavity mode; in the latter case
the transform is just the identity, and of course any ﬁeld
is a self-transform for identity.

IV. HEMI-CONFOCAL CAVITY

We will now illustrate this formalism by considering in
more detail a particular cavity, the hemi-confocal cavity,
which is made of a plane mirror and a curved mirror R of
radius of curvature R separated by a distance L = R/2
(see ﬁgure 3), which has already been studied in terms of
beam trajectories[16]. We have studied this kind of cavity
both theoretically and experimentally in the framework
of our experimental investigations on cw ampliﬁcation of
images in a cavity[17].

A. Theoretical study

It is straightforward to show that the round-trip Gouy
phase-shift α is equal to π/2 for a hemi-confocal cavity,

so that its degeneracy order is 1/4: there are four distinct
families of transverse modes, depending on the value p+q
modulo 4. The round-trip Gauss matrix, starting from
the plane mirror, is:

So two round-trips give the opposite of the identity (sym-

matrix of the confocal cavity, and four round-trips give
the identity, as expected for a cavity with degeneracy
order 1/4.

FIG. 4: Ray trajectory picture in the hemi-confocal cavity

For example, the hemi-confocal cavity tuned on the
m + n = 0[4] family will transmit the sum of the even
part of the image and of the even part of its Fourier
transform.

B. Numerical simulation

We will now give results of a numerical simulation in
a simple experimental conﬁguration:
in order to create
the input image Ein, a large gaussian T EM00 mode is
intercepted by a single inﬁnite slit of width w0, shifted
from the optical axis by 1.5w0, which is imaged (near
ﬁeld) onto the reference plane (zref ) of the cavity. With-
out the slit, the input T EM00 mode has in the reference
plane a size equal to three times the waist of the T EM00
cavity eigenmode. We study the transmission of this in-
put image through the cavity at the near ﬁeld detection
plane. We represented on ﬁgure (5) the input image, its
decomposition over the ﬁrst 400 T EMpq modes, (with
0 < p, q < 20), and its spatial Fourier transform. Limit-
400 modes
ing the decomposition of the image to only
is equivalent to cutting high-order spatial frequencies,
and therefore takes into account the limited transverse
size of the optics.

∼

Figure 6 gives the expected transmission peak as a
function of cavity length, and displays the four families of
modes in a given free spectral range. The height of each
peak is proportional to the intensity of the image pro-
jection on the family of mode. For instance a symmetric
ﬁeld will have no intensity on the 1[4] and 3[4] families.
Figure 7 gives the amplitude of the transmitted ﬁeld for
each family of modes, calculated from the transmission of
the 400 ﬁrst T EMmn modes. For each family, one easily
recognizes the even or odd part of the image (two slits)
and the Fourier transform along the axis perpendicular
to the slits.

The expected intensity image is represented on ﬁgure
8 for each family. One observes that the Fourier trans-
form is much more intense that the transmitted image,
even though equation (36) shows that there is as much
energy in the Fourier transform than in the image. In the
present case, the Fourier transform is much more concen-

trated than the image, which is the reason why the local
intensity is higher. As the parity information on the ﬁeld
disappears when looking at the intensity, it is diﬃcult to
infer from it which resonance is involved. An indication
can come from the intensity on the optical axis, which
is always zero for an antisymmetric output. One can
note that if we add the amplitude ﬁelds corresponding to
the resonances m + n = j[4] and m + n = j + 2[4], the

transform overlap. But here we have some a priori in-
formation on the image that we have sent and we know
which part of the output is the image, and which part
is the Fourier transform. In more general cases, the in-
formation we lose is the knowledge about whether what
we observe is the image or the Fourier transform, as well
as half the image (since the parity is ﬁxed by the geom-
etry of the cavity, only half the output image is relevant
to reconstruct it). Therefore for a given resonance, this
cavity not only cuts 75% of the modes, it also destroys
75 % of the information.

As a conclusion, the transmission through the cav-
ity transforms the input image into its its self-transform
function corresponding to the round-trip transform of the
hemi-confocal cavity. One may notice that for the reso-
nance m + n = 0[4], a self-Fourier image, i.e a SFF ﬁeld,
is obtained.

For practical reasons, we had to use a hemi-confocal
cavity in our experimental set-up designed to study para-
metric image ampliﬁcation in optical cavities (see ﬁgure
9). We placed a USAF (US Air Force) resolution target
on the path of a T EM00 mode produced by a Nd:YAG
laser, and imaged it onto the plane mirror of a hemi-
confocal cavity, of length 50mm, servo-locked on a res-
onance peak. The size of the T EM00 mode inside the
cavity was three times larger than the eigenmode waist
of the cavity. The ﬁnesse of the cavity was about 600.
The plane mirror of the cavity was then imaged on a CCD
camera. The experimental transmitted images, together
with the corresponding objects, are represented on ﬁg-
ure (10). The size of the T EM00 cavity mode is roughly
equal to the width of the transmitted slit in the second
line. One notices that each output image is symmetric,
the center of symmetry being the axis of the cavity. It
is possible to recognize on the transmitted images the
symmetrized input image, and the patterns at the center
corresponding to the Fourier transform of the input. For
a slit it is well known that its Fourier transform is the
sinc-squared diﬀraction pattern, perpendicular to the slit.
This kind of pattern can be recognized on the upper two
images of the ﬁgure. On the last image the symmetrized
”2” is somewhat truncated by the limited ﬁeld of view

two terms corresponding to the Fourier transform vanish.
One only gets the even or odd part of the image, which
corresponds to the action on the image of a confocal cav-
ity. It is interesting to note that no combination of modes
transmit only the Fourier transform of the image.

An interesting question is to know which information is
lost in the transmission through the cavity, since one only
transmits a quarter of the input intensity. By looking at
the transmitted image, it seems that no information is re-
ally lost, except on areas where the image and its Fourier

imposed by the size of the illuminating T EM00 mode,
whereas the diﬀraction pattern has the general shape of
the Fourier transform of the slit formed by the main bar
of the ”2”, tilted at 45◦, plus a more complex shape corre-
sponding to the Fourier transform of the remaining part
of the image.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, this paper has studied in a general way
the problem of image transmission through a paraxial
cavity, characterized by its round-trip (ABCD) matrix,
the eigenvalues of which give the round-trip Gouy phase
shift, and therefore the order of transverse degeneracy of
the cavity. We have shown that the formalism of self-
transform functions, already applied in optics but never
to cavities, was very useful to understand how an image
is transmitted through a degenerate cavity: at resonance
the cavity transmits the self-transform part of the in-
put ﬁeld. We have then focused our attention on the
hemi-confocal cavity, which performs a spatial Fourier

9

transform over one round trip, and shown that it trans-
mit the self-Fourier part of the image. This property was
demonstrated experimentally on various shapes of input
images. Furthermore we have shown that a transverse
degenerate cavity is a very convenient way to produce a
self-transform ﬁeld from any input ﬁeld, for instance in
the case of the hemi-confocal cavity a ﬁeld which is its
own Fourier transform, i.e. its own far-ﬁeld). Such states
are interesting for optics[15] and in physics in general[11].
From a more practical point of view, transverse degen-
erate cavities can be useful for imaging purposes. For ex-
ample they are necessary for intracavity c.w. parametric
ampliﬁcation of images. The observation of c.w.
image
ampliﬁcation with low pump powers will be reported in a
forthcoming publication [17]. These experimental results
open the way to the observation of speciﬁc quantum as-
pects of imaging which have been predicted to occur in
such devices, such as noiseless phase-sensitive ampliﬁca-
tion, local squeezing or spatial entanglement.

APPENDIX: EIGENVECTORS AND GOUY
PHASE OF A CAVITY

Let A,B,C and D be the coeﬃcients of the cavity
round-trip Gauss matrix Tcav, starting from any plane.
Given that AD
BC = 1, the eigenvalues of this Gauss
are:

−

µ1,2 = e±i arccos A+D

(A.1)

They are simply related to the matrix trace A+D, and as
expected independent of the reference plane one choses
in the cavity to calculate the Gauss matrix. Let us now
consider the fundamental gaussian mode of the cavity,
E(r) = E(0)e−ikr2/2q, where q is the complex radius of
curvature. Using the propagation relation (5), one easily
computes that, on axis, it becomes after one round trip:

The round-trip Gouy phase shift α for this mode is there-
fore:

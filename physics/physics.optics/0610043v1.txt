Abstract

The perceived lateral position of a transmitted beam, upon propagating through a slab
made of homogeneous, isotropic, dielectric material at an oblique angle, can be controlled
through varying the velocity of the slab.
In particular, by judiciously selecting the slab
velocity, the transmitted beam can emerge from the slab with no lateral shift in position.
Thereby, a degree of concealment can be achieved. This concealment is explored in numerical
calculations based on a 2D Gaussian beam.

Keywords: Minkowski constitutive relations, moving slab, Gaussian beam, counterposition

Introduction

The topic of invisibility — which is a very old one in optics and electromagnetics (Wolf &
Habashy 1993) — has lately acquired a new lease of life with the advent of metamaterials
(Fedotov, Mladyonov, Prosvirnin & Zheludev 2005; Al`u & Engheta 2006). In a similar vein,
it has recently been proposed that the exotic electromagnetic possibilities oﬀered by metama-
terials may be harnessed to achieve cloaking, at least in principle (Leonhardt 2006; Milton &
Nicorovici 2006; Pendry, Schurig & Smith 2006). The theoretical arguments underlying this pro-
posed cloaking are based on the facilitation of coordinate transformations by nonhomogeneous
metamaterials.

A quite diﬀerent approach to concealing a material is pursued in this paper. It is based
on the perceived deﬂection of light by a material slab translating at constant velocity. No
special material properties are required, but for illustrative purposes, we consider an isotropic,
In two previous studies, we have demonstrated that the

much–heralded negative–phase–velocity phenomenon often associated with negatively refracting
electromagnetic metamaterials can be realized by conventional materials through the process of
uniform motion (Mackay & Lakhtakia 2004, 2006a). Here, we demonstrate that a substantial
degree of concealment may also be realized by uniform motion.

As regards notational matters, 3 vectors are in boldface, with theˆ symbol identifying unit
vectors. Double underlining signiﬁes a 3

superscript T denotes the transpose of a column vector. The permittivity and permeability of
vacuum are ǫ0 and µ0. The vacuum wavenumber is k0 = ω√ǫ0µ0 with ω being the angular
frequency, and the vacuum wavelength is λ0 = 2π/k0.

space. Suppose that a plane wave is launched with wavevector ki = kiˆki from vacuum (z < 0)
towards the half–space z > 0 occupied by an isotropic, nondissipative, dielectric material. This
material moves at constant velocity v = vˆv = vˆx, parallel to the interface and in the plane of
incidence. In an inertial frame of reference that moves with the same velocity v with respect to
the laboratory frame of reference wherein ki is speciﬁed, the refracting material is characterized
by relative permittivity ǫr. The Minkowski constitutive relations of the moving half–space in
the laboratory frame of reference are (Chen 1983)

In order to exclude the possibility of evanescent plane waves, ǫr > 1 is assumed. The envisaged
scenario is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.

The angle φt between the refracted wavevector kt = ktˆkt, as observed from the laboratory

In connection with Figure 2, it is of particular interest here that φP = φi at (i) β = 0.08 for
φi = 15◦, (ii) β = 0.29 for φi = 45◦, and (iii) β = 0.78 for φi = 75◦. That is, there exist angles of
incidence at which the time–averaged Poynting vector is not deﬂected by the uniformly moving
half–space. This suggests that it may be possible for a light beam — not to be confused with a
plane wave — to pass through a uniformly moving slab at an oblique angle without experiencing
a lateral shift in position. That suggestion inspired the research presented in the next section.

3 Beam propagation through a uniformly moving slab

Suppose that the uniformly moving half–space considered in
2 is now replaced by a slab of
§
thickness L moving at constant velocity v = vˆx parallel to its two surfaces, as schematically
illustrated in Figure 3. The slab — which is characterized, as before, by ǫr > 1 in a co–moving
reference frame — is immersed in vacuum.

Regardless of the polarization state, the transmitted beam does not undergo a lateral shift

4 Concluding remarks

Our numerical investigations show that a 2D beam can pass obliquely through a uniformly
moving slab without undergoing a lateral shift in its position. At a ﬁxed angle of beam incidence,
this eﬀect occurs only for a unique translational slab velocity. However, extrapolating from
Figure 2, for every angle of beam incidence a slab velocity can be found at which the beam
undergoes no lateral shift. Furthermore, for a ﬁxed angle of incidence, a pulsed beam will
undergo zero lateral deﬂection, provided that the constitutive parameters do not vary with
angular frequency in the pulse spectrum.

The degree of concealment achieved by uniform motion is not 100% due to reﬂections but,
3, almost 90% of the peak energy density
§

in the particular case of the example considered in
of the beam can be transmitted without deﬂection.

Appendix

The reﬂection coeﬃcients rk,⊥ and transmission coeﬃcients tk,⊥ are straightforwardly calculated
by solving the reﬂection–transmission problem as a boundary value problem. We outline the
procedure here, further details being available elsewhere (Lakhtakia & Messier 2005).

Consider the plane wave with electric and magnetic ﬁeld phasors

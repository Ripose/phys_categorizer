In this Letter, it is claimed that, in addition to the Chiao-Wu geometric phase and optical
Aharonov-Carmi geometric phase, there exists a new interesting geometric phase caused by the
helicity inversion of photons in the optical ﬁber composed periodically of left- and right- handed
(LRH) media. By making use of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related
unitary transformation formulation, we calculate this geometric phase. It is emphasized that this
geometric phase should not been neglected when considering the anomalous refraction on the inter-
faces between left- and right- handed media.

Keywords: Geometric phase, helicity inversion, left-handed media

More recently, a kind of composite media ( the so-called left-handed media ) having a frequency band where the
eﬀective permittivity (ε) and the eﬀective permeability (µ) are simultaneously negative attracts attention of many
researchers in various ﬁelds such as materials science, condensed matter physics, optics and electromagnetism [1–5].
In 19641, Veselago considered this peculiar medium and showed that it possesses a negative index of refraction [6].
It follows from the Maxwell’s equations that in this medium the Poynting vector and wave vector of electromagnetic
wave would be antiparallel, i. e., the wave vector k, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld H form a left-handed
system; thus Veselago referred to such materials as “left-handed (LH) ”, and correspondingly, the ordinary medium in
which k, E and H form a right-handed system may be termed the “right-handed (RH) ” medium. Other authors call
this class of materials “negative-index media (NIM)”, “double negative media (DNM) [5]” and Veselago’s media. It
is readily veriﬁed that in such media having both ε and µ negative, there exist a number of peculiar electromagnetic
properties, for instance, many dramatically diﬀerent propagation characteristics stem from the sign change of the
group velocity, including reversal of both the Doppler shift and Cherenkov radiation, anomalous refraction, modiﬁed
spontaneous emission rates and even reversals of radiation pressure to radiation tension [2,6]. In experiments, this
artiﬁcial negative electric permittivity media may be obtained by using the array of long metallic wires (ALMWs),
which simulates the plasma behavior at microwave frequencies, and the artiﬁcial negative magnetic permeability media
may be built up by using small resonant metallic particles, e. g., the split ring resonators (SRRs) with very high
magnetic polarizability [3,7–9].

All the above optical and electromagnetic properties and eﬀects of left-handed media were predicted and studied
based on the classical Maxwell’s theory. Since left-handed media possess so many peculiar properties and eﬀects, we
think it is also physically interesting to consider some certain quantum eﬀects in the left-handed optical ﬁber. So, in
this paper, we deal with a problem of geometric quantum phase of photons inside the left- and right- handed (LRH)-
periodical ﬁber.

Historically, the ﬁrst physical realization of the Berry’s quantum geometric (topological) phase [10] was proposed by
Chiao and Wu [11–14] after Berry suggested the adiabatic quantum theory. By using Berry’s adiabatic phase formula
[10], Chiao and Wu investigated the geometric phase of the polarized photon propagating inside a noncoplanarly curved
optical ﬁber [11]. Based on the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory [15–17], we have calculated the non-adiabatic non-
cyclic Chiao-Wu geometric phase of photons [18]. Since it is readily veriﬁed that the photon propagating inside a
curved ﬁber may be regarded as acted upon by an eﬀective Coriolis force ( Lorentz-type force ) [18,19], one can predict
that there exists an optical Aharonov-Carmi eﬀect [20,21] for moving photons in the curved optical ﬁber, where the

Note that, in the literature, many authors mention the year when Veselago suggested the left-handed media by mistake.
They claim that Veselago proposed the concept of left-handed media in 1968. On the contrary, the true fact is as follows:
Veselago’s excellent paper was ﬁrst published in July, 1964 [Usp. Fiz. Nauk 92, 517-526 (1964)]. In 1968, this original paper
was translated into English by W. H. Furry and published again in the journal of Sov. Phys. Usp. [6].

geometric phase is similar to the Aharonov-Bohm phase.

In the present Letter, we argue that, if, for example, the photons propagating inside a ﬁber that is composed
periodically of left- and right- handed (LRH) media, then a new geometric phase of photons due to helicity inversion
will arise. In this LRH-periodical optical ﬁber, helicity inversion ( or the transitions between helicity states ) of photons
may be easily caused by the interaction of light ﬁeld with interfaces of LRH materials. So, this geometric phase arises
on the interfaces between left- and right- handed media ( LRH interfaces ), where the anomalous refraction occurs
when the incident lightwave travels to the LRH interfaces. we think, in the literature, it gets less attention than it
deserves. So, in what follows, we calculate the photon wavefunction and geometric phase in this physical process, and
emphasize that we should attach importance to this geometric phase when considering the wave propagation on the
LRH interfaces.

c in LH section and n ω

Let us consider the applied optical ﬁber that is fabricated periodically from both left- and right- handed (LRH)
media with the optical refractive index being −n and n, respectively. Thus the wave vector of photon moving along
the ﬁber is respectively −n ω
c in RH section, where ω and c respectively denote the frequency
and speed in a vacuum of light. For convenience, we assume that the periodical length, b, of LH is equal to that of
RH in the ﬁber. If the eigenvalue of photon helicity is σ in right-handed sections, then, according to the deﬁnition
of helicity, h = k
|k| · J with J denoting the total angular momentum of the photon, the eigenvalue of helicity acquires
a minus sign in left-handed sections. We assume that at t = 0 the light propagates in the right-handed section and
the initial eigenvalue of photon helicity is σ. So, in the wave propagation inside the LRH-periodical optical ﬁber, the
helicity eigenvalue of h is then (−)m σ with m =
nb . This, therefore,

[S+, S−] = 2S3 and [S3, S±] = ±S±. The time-dependent frequency parameter ω (t) may be taken to be ω (t) =
dt p (t), where p (t) = (−)m with m =
ζ d
, and ζ is the coupling coeﬃcient, which is determined by the physical
mechanism of interaction between light ﬁeld and media. Since p (t) is a periodical function, by using the analytical
continuation procedure, it can be rewritten as the following combinations of analytical functions

In what follows, we solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation ( in the unit ¯h = 1 )

governing the propagation of light in the LRH- periodical ﬁber. According to the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory,
the exact particular solution |Ψσ (t)i of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (3) is diﬀerent from the eigenstate
of the invariant I(t) only by a time-dependent c- number factor exp

with |Φσ (t)i being the eigenstate of the invariant I(t) ( corresponding to the particular eigenvalue σ ) and satisfying
the eigenvalue equation I (t) |Φσ (t)i = σ |Φσ (t)i, where the eigenvalue σ of the invariant I(t) is time-independent.
Thus we have

So, in order to obtain |Ψσ (t)i, we should ﬁrst obtain the eigenstate |Φσ (t)i of the invariant I(t). In accordance with
the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory, the invariant I(t) is a conserved operator ( i. e., it possesses time-independent eigenvalues
) and agrees with the following Liouville-Von Neumann equation

− iω cos θ = 0,

(cid:17)
˙θ + ω sin φ = 0,

which are used to determine the time-dependent parameters, θ (t) and φ (t), of the invariant I(t).

It should be noted that we cannot easily solve the eigenvalue equation I (t) |Φσ (t)i = σ |Φσ (t)i, for the time-
dependent parameters θ (t) and φ (t) are involved in the invariant (7). If, however, we could ﬁnd ( or construct )
a unitary transformation operator V (t) to make V †(t)I(t)V (t) be time-independent, then the eigenvalue equation
problem of I(t) is therefore easily resolved. According to our experience for utilizing the invariant-related unitary
transformation formulation [22], we suggest a following unitary transformation operator

where β(t) and β∗(t) will be determined by calculating IV = V †(t)I(t)V (t) in what follows.

Calculation of IV = V †(t)I(t)V (t) yields

V (t) = exp [β (t) S+ − β∗ (t) S−] ,

IV = V † (t) I (t) V (t) = 2S3,

if β and β∗ are chosen to be β (t) = − θ(t)
2 exp [iφ (t)]. This, therefore, means that we can
change the time-dependent I(t) into a time-independent IV, and the result is IV = 2S3. Thus, the eigenvalue equation
of IV is IV |σi = σ |σi with σ = ±1, and consequently the eigenvalue equation of I(t) is I (t) V (t) |σi = σV (t) |σi.
So, we obtain the eigenstate |Φσ (t)i of I(t), i. e., |Φσ (t)i = V (t) |σi.

2 exp [−iφ (t)] ,

β∗ (t) = − θ(t)

Correspondingly, H(t) is transformed into

Further analysis shows that the exact particular solution |Ψσ (t)iV of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (12)
is diﬀerent from the eigenstate |σi of the time-independent invariant IV only by a time-dependent c- number factor

It follows from the obtained expression (15) for geometric phase of photons that, if the frequency parameter ω is
˙θ ≃ 0, the Berry
ω ) of parameter space of invariant I(t) is

small (i. e., the adiabatic quantum process ) and then according to the auxiliary equations (8),
phase ( adiabatic geometric phase ) in a cycle ( i. e., one round trip, T ≃ 2π

ϕ(g)

σ (T ) = 2πσ(1 − cos θ),

where 2π(1 − cos θ) is a solid angle over the parameter space of the invariant I(t), which means the geometric phase
is related only to the geometric nature of the pathway along which quantum systems evolve. Expression (17) is
analogous to the magnetic ﬂux produced by a monopole of strength σ existing at the origin of the parameter space.
This, therefore, implies that geometric phases diﬀer from dynamical phases and involve the global and topological
properties of the time evolution of quantum systems.

It is worthwhile to point out that the geometric phase of photons due to helicity inversion presented here is of
quantum level. However, whether the Chiao-Wu geometric phase due to the spatial geometric shape of ﬁber is of
quantum level or not is not apparent ( see, for example, the arguments between Haldane and Chiao, Tomita about this
problem [24,25]), since the expression for the Chiao-Wu geometric phase can be derived by using both the classical
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, diﬀerential geometry and quantum mechanics [13,14,23–25]. However, the geometric
phase in this Letter can be considered only by Berry’s adiabatic quantum theory and Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory,
namely, the classical electrodynamics cannot predict this geometric phase. Although many investigators have taken
into account the boundary condition problem and anomalous refraction in left-handed media by using the classical
Maxwell’s theory [4,6], less attention is paid to this geometric phase due to helicity inversion. It is believed that this
geometric phase originates at the quantum level, but survives the correspondence-principle limit into the classical level.
So, We emphasize that it is essential to take into consideration this geometric phase in investigating the anomalous
refraction on the LRH interfaces. In addition, in the Chiao-Wu case, there exists the vacuum geometric phase at pure
quantum level, which arises from the vacuum quantum ﬂuctuations of photons ﬁeld [18]. We think such quantum
vacuum geometric phase deserves consideration also in the present case.

It is well known that geometric phases arise only in time-dependent quantum systems. In the present problem, the
transitions between helicity states on the LRH interfaces, which is a time-dependent process, results in the geometric
phase of photons. This may be viewed from two aspects: (i) it is apparently seen in Eq. (8) that if the frequency
parameter ω in the Hamiltonian (1) vanishes, then ˙φ = 0 and the geometric phase (15) is therefore vanishing; (ii) it
follows from (2) that the frequency coeﬃcient ω (t) of Hamiltonian (1) is

In addition to obtaining the expression (15) for geometric phase, we obtain the wavefunction (16) of photons in the
LRH- optical ﬁber by solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (3) based on the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant
theory [15] and the invariant-related unitary transformation formulation [16,17]. We believe that this would enable
us to consider the propagation of light ﬁelds inside the optical ﬁber in more detail.

Since we have constructed an eﬀective Hamiltonian (1) to describe the time evolution of helicity states of photons,
it should be noted that the method presented here is a phenomenological description of propagation of lightwave in
the LRH-periodical ﬁber. This phenomenological description is based on the assumption that the direction of wave
vector k becomes opposite nearly instantaneously on the LRH interfaces. This assumption holds if the periodical
length b is much larger than the wavelength of lightwave in the ﬁber.

To close this Letter, we conclude with some remarks on the potential signiﬁcance of the subject in this Letter:

(i) The obtained geometric phase itself is physically interesting. Moreover, it is necessary to consider this geometric
phase in discussing the anomalous refraction and wave propagation in left-handed media ( on the LRH interfaces ).
(ii) Helicity inversion of photons, which is in exact analogy with the transition operation from 0 to 1 in digital
circuit, can be caused due to the electromagnetic interactions on LRH interfaces, and the time evolution of helicity
states is governed by (16). We think these processes may possess some potential applications in information technology
and therefore deserve further investigation.

(iii) It is of physical interest to consider the quantum eﬀects such as propagation of photons ﬁeld, polarization
of photon states ( time evolution of photon wavefunction ) and spontaneous emission decay rate of atoms [2] in
left-handed media. In this Letter, an illustrative example of quantum eﬀects of photons ﬁeld resulting from helicity
inversion caused by the LRH interfaces is presented. We hope the present consideration in this paper would open
up new opportunities for investigating more quantum mechanical properties, phenomena and eﬀects in left-handed
media.

The existing optical microscopes form an image by collecting photons emitted from an object.
Here we report on the experimental realization of microscopy without the need for direct optical
communication with the sample. To achieve this, we have scanned a single gold nanoparticle acting
as a nano-antenna in the near ﬁeld of a sample and have studied the modiﬁcation of its intrinsic
radiative properties by monitoring its plasmon spectrum.

PACS numbers: 07.79.Fc, 42.50.Lc, 42.30.-d, 78.67.Bf

Over the years, several clever techniques such as dark-
ﬁeld, phase contrast, ﬂuorescence, diﬀerential interfer-
ence contrast, confocal, and scanning near-ﬁeld micro-
scopies have provided powerful ways of performing op-
tical imaging. In all these methods, as in any other vi-
sual process, one ”sees” an object when photons orig-
inating from it reach the detector. The details of the
imaging mechanism depend sensitively on the intensity,
phase and polarization of light both in the illumination
and collection channels. The thought of recording op-
tical images without receiving photons from the object,
therefore, seems to be a contradiction in terms. In this
Letter we show that this is indeed possible if one monitors
the intrinsic spectral properties of a nanoscopic antenna
scanned close to the sample.

When an oscillating dipole is placed in conﬁned ge-
ometries its radiative properties, such as eigenfrequency
In an intuitive pic-
and linewidth, are modiﬁed [1, 2].
ture these modiﬁcations are due to the interaction of
the oscillating dipole with its image dipoles whereby the
boundary materials and their distances to the oscillator
determine the strength and phase of this interaction. In
an alternative point of view the radiative changes are
due to the modiﬁcation of the density of photon states
available for emission. In the context of recent develop-
ments in nano-optics, theoretical investigations have ex-
tended these concepts to subwavelength geometries and
have shown that the linewidth [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and the tran-
sition frequency [5, 6] of a dipole also respond sensitively
to the optical contrast of its nanoscopic environment.
Hence, it has been proposed that the spectral modiﬁ-
cations of a nano-antenna could serve as the signal for
a novel mode of Scanning Near-ﬁeld Optical Microscopy
(SNOM) [4, 5, 7]. Here we report on the ﬁrst realiza-
tion of this idea, using a single gold nanoparticle as a
subwavelength antenna.

It is well known that the collective excitation of free
electrons in metallic particles can give rise to plasmon
resonances, depending on the size, shape, and index of
refraction of the particle as well as the optical constants
of its surrounding [8]. For a spherical particle placed in a
homogenous medium, the plasmon spectrum can be cal-

culated using Mie theory based on a multipole expansion.
For gold particles of diameter 100 nm or smaller the op-
tical response is by large due to the dipolar mode of the
plasmon excitation. Thus, a gold nanoparticle can be
considered as a dipolar antenna with a well-deﬁned res-
onance frequency and linewidth. Having a large polariz-
ability, single gold nanoparticles can be optically detected
even down to a size of about 5 nm [9]. Furthermore, the
large quantum yield of a gold nanoparticle [10] makes it
a suitable candidate for studying the radiative properties
of its environment. Finally, compared to the commonly
used systems such as single dye molecules or semiconduc-
tor nanocrystals, metallic nanoparticles have the decisive
advantage that they are indeﬁnitely photostable.

In our laboratory we have developed a procedure for
mounting a single gold nanoparticle to the end of an un-
coated glass ﬁber tip [11]. We have also reported on the
realization of apertureless SNOM by detecting the inten-
sity of the light scattered from the gold nanoparticle at a
ﬁxed wavelength [11]. In the current experiment we use
the same kind of probe (particle diameter of 100 nm), but
we now record its plasmon spectrum at every scan pixel.
Figure 1a shows the principal elements of the experiment.
White light from a xenon lamp is brought to the exper-
imental stage via a multimode ﬁber with a core diam-
eter of 100 µm, passed through a polarizer and weakly
focused onto the tip end by using a lens system. The
scattered light is collected by a microscope objective, di-

rected through a pinhole, coupled into a multimode ﬁber,
and sent to a spectrometer equipped with a cooled CCD
camera. Figure 1b displays scattering spectra of a gold
nanoparticle at the end of the tip after it was picked up
but away from the substrate. The diamonds and circles
show the recorded spectra for s and p polarized incident
light, respectively. The fact that the s and p spectra are
nearly identical lets us conclude that the cross-section of
the particle facing the incident beam is to a very good
approximation circular [12].

A suitable sample for our studies should have a mini-
mal topography, large optical contrast with sharp edges
and be suﬃciently transparent to allow detection in
transmission. To fabricate such a sample, ﬁrst we spin
coated latex spheres of diameter 2 µm on a microscope
cover slip at a very low coverage. Next we evaporated
about 8 nm of chromium and removed the latex beads.
The resulting sample consists of 2 µm round openings in a
semi-transparent Cr ﬁlm on a cover glass with very sharp
edges that rise within less than 10 nm [11]. This sam-
ple was placed on a 3D piezoelectric scanner, mounted
on an inverted microscope. A home-made SNOM stage
was used to position the tip and to stabilize its distance
from the sample to about 5-10 nm via shear-force feed-
back [13]. Figure 2a shows the shear-force topography
image recorded when the sample was scanned under the
gold nanoparticle probe, whereas the inset displays a
cross section along cut (ii) (see Fig. 2c). The elevated
annulus (height of about 30 nm) in the middle of the
glass region is produced by the collection of residual ma-
terial at the junction between the latex particles and the
substrate in the spin casting and lift-oﬀ processes.

During the shear-force scan shown in Fig. 2a the spec-
trometer camera was triggered at each of the 1600 pix-
els, and the plasmon spectrum of the gold particle was
recorded. The symbols in Fig. 3a show spectra from pix-
els α and β marked in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b displays the
total intensity integrated over the wavelength range 450-
750 nm for each pixel. As expected, the signal is higher
when the gold nanoparticle is on the glass part of the
sample [11], but the intensity distribution is somewhat
smeared out at the edges because we have not discrim-
inated against unwanted far-ﬁeld stray scattering. Eﬃ-
cient separation of the near-ﬁeld signal from the stray
background is also a central issue in conventional aper-
tureless SNOM using extended tips [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

Now we discuss the essential results of our work,
namely the modiﬁcations of the particle’s plasmon spec-
trum. Comparison of the spectra in Fig. 3a reveals a red
shift and a broadening of α with respect to β. While it
is not possible to state a simple analytic formula for the
spectrum of the nanoparticle in the near ﬁeld of an in-
homogeneous sample, we have found that we can ﬁt our
experimental data using a phenomenological model. In
order to quantify the observed spectral modiﬁcations, we
adapted the formalism of Wokaun, Gordon and Liao [19]

based on the deﬁnition of an eﬀective polarizability for
a metallic nanoparticle. These authors showed that the
total induced dipole moment P (ω) of a nanoparticle with
volume V ≪ λ3 and dipolar polarizability α(ω) is given
by

P (ω) = α(ω) (cid:2)E0 + iη (cid:0)2k3/3(cid:1) P (ω)(cid:3)

(1)

where E0 denotes the applied external electric ﬁeld and
k = 2π/λ. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) considers the dipole
moment that is induced directly by the incident ﬁeld.
The second term describes the so-called radiation damp-
ing eﬀect where the ﬁeld emitted by the particle interacts
with its own dipole moment P (ω). In the original work
of Wokaun and coworkers η was set to 1, but here we
have introduced this real parameter in a phenomenolog-
ical manner to represent the part of the particle’s self
ﬁeld caused by reﬂections from the surroundings. We
note that since we are dealing with near-ﬁeld interac-
tions, retardation eﬀects could be neglected at this point.
Rearrangement of Eq. (1) leads to an expression for the
eﬀective dipolar polarizability,

αef f (ω) =

P (ω)

=

α(ω)
1 − η[i2k3α(ω)/3]

The solid curves in Fig. 1b represent theoretical ﬁts to
the particle plasmon resonance in the absence of a sub-
strate; i.e. η was set to 1. Here the detected intensity

was taken to be proportional to the scattering cross sec-
tion and therefore to k4 |αef f (ω)|2, using the quasi-static
polarizability α(ω) [8, 12]. Following the same proce-
dure, but leaving η as a variable parameter, we then ﬁtted
the plasmon spectra of the gold particle in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the sample. The solid curves in Fig. 3a
show examples of the ﬁts obtained for spectra α and β.
The dashed lines display the linear functions that have
been added to the radiated intensity of the particle to ac-
count for the background scattered light. The excellent
signal-to-noise ratio and the robust ﬁt to the experimen-
tal spectra allow us to determine even small changes in
the peak positions and the full widths at half maxima
(FWHM) of the spectra. The results for all scan pixels
are displayed in Figs. 2c and d. The circular glass open-
ing in the chromium ﬁlm is clearly imaged in both cases.
Figures 3b and c display cross sections of Figs. 2c and
d along cut (i). As expected, the near-ﬁeld coupling of
the antenna to the lossy excitations in the chromium ﬁlm
causes a red shift and a broadening of its resonance when
it is moved from the glass region to above the Cr-ﬁlm [20].
These results embody the essence of this novel near-ﬁeld
imaging mechanism where the information about the lo-
cal optical contrast of the sample is ”encoded” in the
spectrum of the nano-antenna and not in the ﬁeld, phase
or polarization of the received photons.

We now discuss some details of the images in Fig. 2. To
facilitate this, we have overlayed circles as guides to the
eye. These were ﬁrst matched to the circular features of
the topography image and then overlayed onto images 2c
and d, allowing for a lateral oﬀset due to a commonly
observed displacement between the position of the gold
nanoparticle and the lowest edge of the tip that traces
the topography. We note that images 2c and d are much
sharper than that in 2b where the overall scattered in-
tensity is plotted. Furthermore, it is interesting that the
central circular sedimentation does not appear in Figs. 2c
and d, presumably because its refractive index is not very
diﬀerent from that of glass. There are, however, modu-
lations of the resonance wavelength and linewidth in the
illumination direction, both on the Cr-ﬁlm and within
the glass opening. We will discuss these below, but be-
fore doing so, we present numerical calculations that pro-
vide quantitative agreement with the magnitudes of the
observed spectral shift and broadening.

Consideration of experimental parameters such as the
ﬁnite size of the gold particle, its distance to the sample,
the thinness of the Cr-ﬁlm (less than a skin depth) and
the interface between chromium and glass calls for rig-
orous numerical simulations. To do this, we have used
the ﬁnite-element method to solve the time-harmonic
Maxwell’s equations in a two-dimensional setting for the
magnetic ﬁeld component Hx perpendicular to the com-
putational plane. We took the tabulated dielectric func-
tions for gold [21] and chromium [22] and implemented
the Sommerfeld radiation condition with a special per-
fectly matched layer adapted to the structure of the ex-

periment [23]. Figure 3c displays a snap shot of the inten-
sity distribution |Hx|2 at λ = 570 nm for a particular par-
ticle position. We determined the energy ﬂux scattered
into the detection numerical aperture from the angular
spectrum representation of the ﬁeld at the lower border
of the simulation box, which was 7.4 µm wide. By repeat-
ing the calculations for a large number of wavelengths,
we obtained spectra that we ﬁtted using the same proce-
dure used for the experimental spectra. Figures 3e and
f display the central wavelength and the FWHM of the
calculated spectra as a function of particle position. For
comparison, in Figs. 3g and h we also show the experi-
mental data along the illumination direction correspond-
ing to cut (ii) in Fig. 2. In both the theoretical and ex-
perimental curves we ﬁnd about 30 nm broadening and
10 nm of red shift in the plasmon resonance as the par-
ticle is moved from the glass to the chromium section
of the sample. The agreement between the experimental
and theoretical ﬁndings is quantitative even though the
calculations were only two-dimensional.

Next, we turn to the issue of modulations in Figs. 2c
and d, which appear on both Cr and glass sections. The
dashed lines in cross sections 3g and h indicate that these
modulations repeat at a period of about 580 nm, which is
of the order of the particle plasmon resonance wavelength
λres. The key issue is that although we have minimized

the collected stray light by illumination at grazing inci-
dence and by placing a pinhole in the detection path, the
edges of the circular opening can scatter a non-negligible
amount of light onto the detector. This background ﬁeld
interferes with the radiation of the particle at the detec-
tor (note that as shown in Fig. 3a, the background is
much smaller than the particle radiation). As described
in the supplementary material [30], scanning the sam-
ple results in an apparent modulation of the peak wave-
length and linewidth of the plasmon spectrum at a pe-
riod of about λres. Interestingly, Figs. 3e and f also dis-
play periodic modulations but this time at a period of
about λres/2. Indeed, as indicated in Fig. 3d, there are
strong standing waves that can be traced to the interfer-
ence of the particle backscattering and the illumination
ﬁelds around the sample. These fast modulations are,
however, an artefact of 2D considerations which overesti-
mate backscattering as compared to 3D geometries. Fi-
nally, we have checked that due to the large absorption
of Cr, the coupling of the particle emission to surface
plasmons [24] in the Cr ﬁlm plays a negligible role in all
these processes.

As a last point, we remark that the spatial resolution of
our method depends on the size of the antenna. In our
current experiment, however, the observed edge sharp-
ness of 170-370 nm in Figs. 3 have been strongly inﬂu-
enced by the above-mentioned modulations, preventing
us from determining the true resolution of the system.
This source of artefact could be fully eliminated if imag-
ing were performed via the measurement of the excited-
state lifetime of a nanoscopic ﬂuorescent emitter.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the intrin-
sic spectral properties of a nano-antenna can be used to
probe the near-ﬁeld optical contrast of a sample. The
interesting aspect of this novel experiment is that there
is neither a need to illuminate the sample, nor to receive
light from it; instead one has to excite a subwavelength
radiating dipole and measure the changes in its radiative
characteristics. Although in the present work we have
used photons to ”read out” the spectrum of the antenna,
one could imagine achieving this via electronic excitation
of plasmon resonances [25] or by using electrical excita-
tion of luminescent material [26, 27]. Changes of polari-
ton or plasmon resonances in scanning probe microscopy
have been also addressed in recent experiments where a
tip interacts with an extended open geometry [28, 29].
Here we have realized an experiment where the modiﬁ-
cation of a well-deﬁned localized plasmon resonance due
to its near-ﬁeld interaction with the sample has been put
into evidence. Future experiments using very small gold
nanoparticles [9] or ﬂuorescent emitters promise to push
the resolution of our method to the nanometer level.

Supplementary material for ”Optical microscopy using
the spectral modiﬁcations of a nano-antenna” by T.
Kalkbrenner, U. H˚akanson, A. Sch¨adle, S. Burger, C.
Henkel, and V. Sandoghdar

We treat the issue of modulations observed both in
peak position and linewidth along the direction of illu-
mination, both on the Cr and glass parts of the sample
(see Figs. 2c, 2d, and 3g and 3h of the Letter). We be-
lieve that the modulation is caused by the interference
between the particle radiation and the stray light scat-
tered by the edge(s) of the chromium ﬁlm. In our exper-
iment the illumination and therefore the light scattered
by the edges are white. The light scattered by the par-
ticle, on the other hand, follows its plasmon spectrum.
Figure 4a below shows the schematic essence of the sit-
uation at hand, where we have replaced the sample by
a localized white scatterer (this is justiﬁed because the
pinhole in our detection path only selects light from a
very small region of the sample). Let us consider the
gold particle to be ﬁxed. For simplicity, we can take its
radiation spectrum to be a Lorentzian of width γ, cen-
tered at frequency ω0 (see Fig. 4b). The electric ﬁeld of
the light scattered by the particle can be written,

(3)

(4)

Epart(ω) = Apart

γ/2
γ/2 − i(ω − ω0)

.

The electric ﬁeld of the background light can be written
as,

Ebg(ω, z) = Abgeiωz/c,

where z is deﬁned as the path diﬀerence between the
particle emission and that of the background light (see
Fig. 4a). Here we have taken the paths from the gold
particle and the white scatterer to be about equal, which
is a very good assumption for a far detector. Note that
z ≈ y for grazing incidence. The total intensity at the
detector is thus given by

Itot(ω, z) = |Epart(ω) + Ebg(ω, z)|2.

(5)

To approximate our experimental conditions, we take γ =
0.2ω0 and consider the intensity of the background light
to be about 10% of the maximum particle radiation. Now
we let z vary (i.e. we scan the sample). Each wavelength
component of the background ﬁeld and the particle ﬁeld
interfere diﬀerently, leading to a slight modiﬁcation of
the line shape. Fig. 4c shows examples of the resulting
spectrum for four distinct path diﬀerences. Fig. 4d shows
the same information in grey scales over a displacement
of about 3λ0. Note that although the resulting spectra
are no longer truly Lorentzian, one can still attribute a
line center and FWHM to them.

z=z +0 l0/4

Figures 4e and f show the FWHMs and peak frequen-
cies of these spectra, which turn out to oscillate by a
small amount. The oscillations are not periodic, but for
small displacements one can recognize a period of about
λ0 = ω0/2πc. This picture is in very good agreement
with the observation of the small modulations in our ex-
perimental data.

The propagation of a Bessel beam (or Bessel-X wave) is analyzed on the basis of a vectorial
treatment. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are obtained by considering a realistic situation able to
generate that kind of scalar ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, we analyze the ﬁeld due to a ring-shaped aperture
over a metallic screen on which a linearly polarized plane wave impinges. On this basis, and in the
far ﬁeld approximation, we can obtain information about the propagation of energy ﬂux and the
velocity of the energy.

The motion of a Bessel beam is of great interest in physics both for its characteristic as a non-diﬀracting beam
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and for its implications with regard to the topic of superluminality [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Extended
studies have been devoted to these subjects from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. However, in
spite of the many eﬀorts devoted to this topic, no deﬁnite answer has been found about the amount of the energy
transfer and its velocity.

As far as Bessel beam propagation is concerned, the problem is mainly related to the diﬃculty in ﬁnding the
vectorial ﬁeld that describes this system, while, on the contrary, the ﬁeld in the scalar approximation is well-known.
The purpose of the present work is to investigate the propagation of a Bessel beam on the basis of a vectorial
treatment. This kind of approach allows us to obtain information regarding the propagation of the energy ﬂux and
the energy mean velocity.

A Bessel beam consists of a set of plane waves with directions of propagation s = α1i+ β1j + γ1k which makes
the same angle θ0 (0 ≤ θ0 < π/2) with the z-axis (hence γ1 = cos θ0 for all the plane waves). In spherical coordinates
(ρ, θ, ϕ), the direction of propagation is speciﬁed by

(1)

(2)

Thus, for propagation in vacuum or air, each one of these waves, at the point x, y, z, can be written as

α1 = sin θ0 cos ϕ , β1 = sin θ0 sin ϕ γ1 = cos θ0 .

u(P ) = u0dϕ exp[ik0(α1x + β1y + γ1z)] exp(−iωt),

where u0dϕ is the amplitude of the elementary wave, ω is the angular frequency, k0 = ω/c is the wavenumber, and
x, y and z denotes the Cartesian coordinates of P . In cylindrical coordinates ρ, ψ, z around the z-axis

and the total ﬁeld U , given by the superposition of all the waves (2), can be obtained by integrating over dϕ, that is,

x = ρ cos ψ, y = ρ sin ψ, z ≡ z,

U = u0

FIG. 2: Electric ﬁelds Ex, Ey and Ez normalized to 2πe0 exp(iξz) (continuous lines) vs. ρ, as given by Eqs. (12)-(14), for
k = 2, ψ = 10◦ and θ0 = 10◦. In Ez phase factor eiπ/2 is disregarded. The dashed line represents the normalized scalar ﬁeld
(3) for the same parameter values.

The scalar ﬁeld of Eq. (3) is known as a Bessel beam (or Bessel-X wave), the unusual features of which are

- that it does not change its shape during propagation, since its amplitude is independent of z[15];
- that it propagates in the z direction with phase and group velocities v = c/ cos θ0 larger than c[8, 9, 10, 16].
Both the above mentioned characteristics can be analyzed in detail by means of a vectorial treatment, since the scalar
ﬁeld (3) represents an approximation of an electromagnetic ﬁeld, and only a knowledge of the vectorial ﬁeld (and of
the Poynting vector in particular) can provide detailed information about the energy propagation.

Vectorial ﬁelds with amplitude proportional to the zero-order Bessel function can be found in diﬀerent ways.
However, in order to derive just the vectorial ﬁeld describing a system which has Eq. (3) as scalar approximation,
we have to consider a realistic situation that is able to generate a ﬁeld of that kind. For this purpose, let us consider
the system of Fig. 1, which consists of a ring-shaped aperture, of radius r, over a metallic screen on which a linearly
polarized plane wave impinges (from the left). The ring is placed on the focal plane of the converging system C with
focal length f ≫ λ, λ being the wavelength. Let us consider the impinging electric ﬁled to be polarized in the i

direction, and the thickness d of the ring to be very small with respect to λ. We may assume the element dA of the
ring, at S(r, ϕ, −f ), to behave as an elementary dipole, parallel to i, with amplitude proportional to dϕ (this requires
a suitable choice of the transparency of the ring at S). Thus, the associated ﬁeld at the optical center O of C has the
well-known characteristics of the far ﬁeld radiated by an elementary dipole, that is to be a spherical wave centered
at S, with the electric ﬁeld e in the meridional plane of the dipole through O, and perpendicular to the direction R
from S to O. We can write

R = −r cos ϕ i − r sin ϕ j + f k,
e = exi + eyj + ezk.

The two characteristics mentioned above can be written as

e · R = −r cos ϕ ex − r sin ϕ ey + f ez = 0
(R × e) · i = f ey + r sin ϕ ez = 0,

where we disregarded a phase factor exp(ikR). By solving Eqs. (5) we obtain

At this point, we can assume that the ﬁeld emerging from the optical converging system is a plane wave propagating

this condition can be experimentally obtained by a suitable choice of the transparency of the ring as a function of

Equation (12) (the main contribution of the electric ﬁeld) describes a ﬁeld diﬀerent from the scalar ﬁeld of Eq. (3)
because of the presence of the term depending on tan θ0. However, for θ0 ≪ π/2 (r ≪ f ), as in the present case, this
term is negligible. We note that also the dependence on ψ (which is absent in the scalar approximation) is negligible,
and may be due to the approximation indicated in [17]. In Fig. 2 we report the normalized value of Ex, Ey and Ez vs
ρ, for θ0 = 10◦, together with the scalar ﬁeld of Eq. (3). The scalar ﬁeld is practically coincident with Ex. Therefore,
we can conclude that the vectorial ﬁeld derived above has Eq. (3) as its scalar approximation, at least for r ≪ f .

The magnetic ﬁeld can be derived by Eq. (9), and results in

From a knowledge of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, we are now in a position to evaluate the mean density of the
energy ﬂux which is deﬁned as one half of the real part of the complex Poynting vector[18, 19]

For the ﬁelds (12)-(14) and (15)-(17), it turns out that S has only the k-component

S =

Re (E × H⋆) .

that is the propagation of the energy ﬂux occurs only in the z-direction, in accordance with the information given by
the scalar ﬁeld (3). Moreover, since the ﬂux is independent of z, the energy propagates with no deformation.

Sz =

(19)

(cid:1)

,

In Fig. 3, the behavior of the energy ﬂux (19) is shown as a function of ρ for a few values of θ0. We note that,
for θ0 very small (nearly plane wave) the ﬂux is nearly independent of ρ, while when the beam originates the ﬂux
increases by increasing θ0, and tends to concentrate near ρ = 0, that is, along the z-axis. Thus, for small values of ρ
(that is, in the proximity of the z-axis), the power supplied by a Bessel beam is always greater than the one due to a
plane wave.

As for the velocity of the energy, from Eq. (3) it follows that in the scalar approximation the dependence of the
ﬁeld on t and z occurs only through the quantity (z/c) cos θ0 − t and, therefore, the ﬁeld propagates with velocity
v = c/ cos θ0. On the basis of these arguments, it could be concluded that also the energy propagates with a velocity
ve greater than c.

In the vectorial treatment we can evaluate the energy velocity ve as [18, 19]

ve =

Sz
1
4 (εE · E⋆ + µH · H ⋆)

,

where the quantity (1/4)(εE · E⋆ + µH · H ⋆) is the total mean density of energy which can be evaluated with the help
of Eqs. (12)-(14) and (15)-(17).

In Fig. 4, we report the normalized velocity of energy as a function of the radial coordinate ρ, for θ0 = 10◦. The
velocity is found to be equal to c from ρ = 0 up to near to the ﬁrst zero of the Bessel function: that is, the beam
moves like an almost rigid system, in spite of its dependence on ρ and ψ. In the proximity of the ﬁrst zero of the
Bessel function, the velocity decreases and tends to zero. Naturally, the zero in the velocity does not represent a stop
of the motion but, more simply, the absence of energy ﬂux. In this situation, the concept of velocity has no physical
meaning.

Some remarks must be made on this surprising result. In fact, we recall that for propagation in vacuum “if an
energy density is associated with the magnitude of the wave . . . . . . the transport of energy occurs with the group
velocity, since that is the rate of which the pulse travel along”[20]. If the deﬁnition of the energy velocity as given
by Eq. (20) is applicable also to a Bessel beam (or, more generally, to localized waves), it is not clear what kind of
physical mechanism makes the energy velocity diﬀerent from the phase and group ones.

We wish to recall that the present analysis was performed for an ideal system in the far ﬁeld approximation. For
a real system, we have to take into account the ﬁnite dimension of the converging system, which limits the ﬁeld
depth and introduces diﬀractive eﬀects. The role of diﬀraction, together with the analysis of the near ﬁeld (as in real
experimental situations), make the problem much more complicated, and is beyond the purpose of this paper.

[15] The situation is similar to what occurs when only two plane waves interfere, the only diﬀerence being that the two-wave
interference pattern occupies the whole space, while the ﬁeld (3) is practically limited to a restricted zone of space, that is,
to the ﬁrst zero of the J0 function. In this connection, it is worth noting that the ﬁeld of Eq. (3) is not properly a beam,
since it is not limited by a caustic surface, inasmuch as J0 oscillates when its argument tends to inﬁnity.

[16] With respect to the monocromatic wave of Eq. (3), the situation does not change in the case of a wave packet (that is,
for a modulated carrier). Also in this case, because of the absence of dispersion, all components at diﬀerent frequencies do
not suﬀer deformation and propagate with the same velocity.

[17] To be precise, the amplitude of the ﬁeld is not constant over a wavefront. We will neglect such a variation, which limits the
applicability of our results to a small value of θ0 and ρ. This position is justiﬁed also because we have to avoid the zeros
of the ﬁeld. In fact, when the ﬁeld is zero, we lose information on the direction of propagation, and the Poynting vector
may have some anomaly.

Asymptotic Probability Density Function of

Nonlinear Phase Noise

The asymptotic probability density function of nonlinear phase noise, often

called the Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect, is derived analytically when the number

of ﬁber spans is very large. The nonlinear phase noise is the summation

of inﬁnitely many independently distributed noncentral chi-square random

variables with two degrees of freedom. The mean and standard deviation of

those random variables are both proportional to the square of the reciprocal

of all odd natural numbers. The nonlinear phase noise can also be accurately

modeled as the summation of a noncentral chi-square random variable with

two degrees of freedom and a Gaussian random variable.

When optical ampliﬁers are used to compensate for ﬁber loss, the interaction

of ampliﬁer noise and the Kerr eﬀect causes phase noise, often called the Gordon-

Mollenauer eﬀect or nonlinear phase noise.1 Nonlinear phase noise degrades both

phase-shifted keying (PSK) and diﬀerential phase-shift keying (DPSK) systems2, 3

that have renewed attention recently.4, 5, 6 Usually, the performance of the system is

1

estimated based on the variance of the nonlinear phase noise.1 However, the nonlinear

phase noise is not Gaussian noise3 and the variance is not suﬃcient to characterize

the system. The probability density function (p.d.f.) is required to better understand

the system and evaluates the system performance. This letter provides an analytical

expression of the asymptotic p.d.f. for the nonlinear phase noise when the ampliﬁer

noise is modeled as a distributed process for a large number of ﬁber spans. The

characteristic functions are ﬁrst derived analytically as a simple expression and the

p.d.f is the inverse Fourier transform of the corresponding characteristic function. The

asymptotic p.d.f. can be accurately applied to system having more than 32 spans.

For an N-span ﬁber system, the overall nonlinear phase noise is1

Previous studies8 are equivalent to the Karhunen-Lo´eve transform of ﬁnite num-

ber of random variables of (1) based on numerical calculation. While the eigenvalues

of the covariance matrix corresponds approximately to σ2

k of (10), the eigenvectors

always require numerical calculations.8 The assumption of a distributed process of

(2) can derive both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of (10) analytically.

The p.d.f. of the normalized phase noise of (3) can be calculated by taking the

inverse Fourier transform of either the exact (15) or the approximated (18) charac-

teristic functions. Fig. 1 shows the p.d.f. of the normalized nonlinear phase noise for

three diﬀerent optical SNR of ρ2 = 11, 18, and 25, corresponding to about an error

probability of 10−

6, 10−

9, and 10−

12, respectively, when ampliﬁer noise is the only

impairment. Fig. 1 shows that the p.d.f. using the exact (15) or the approximated

(18) characteristic function, and the Gaussian approximation with mean and variance

of mφ = ρ2 + 1/2 and σ2

φ = (4ρ2 + 1)/6. The exact and approximated p.d.f. overlap

and cannot be distinguished with each other.

Fig. 2 shows the cumulative tail probabilities as a function of Q-factor. The Q-

factor is deﬁned as Q = (φ

mφ)/σφ and gives an error probability or tail probability

−
2erfc(Q/√2) for Gaussian distribution, where erfc(
·

of 1

) is the complementary error

function. Fig. 2 is plotted for the case of ρ2 = 18. From Fig. 2, the p.d.f. calculated

from the exact (15) or approximated (18) characteristic function has no diﬀerence.

The Gaussian approximation underestimates the cumulative tail probability for Q > 1

but overestimates the cumulative tail probability for Q < 1.

The p.d.f. for ﬁnite number of ﬁber spans was derived base on the orthogonal-

ization of (1) by N i.i.d. random variables.8 Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the p.d.f.

for N = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 of ﬁber spans8 with the distributed case of (15). Using an

optical SNR of ρ2 = 18, Fig. 3 is plotted in logarithmic scale to show the diﬀerence

in the tail. Fig. 3 also provides an inset in linear scale of the same p.d.f. to show the

diﬀerence around the mean. The asymptotic p.d.f. of (15) with distributed noise has

the smallest spread in the tail as compared with those p.d.f.’s with N discrete noise

7

sources. The asymptotic p.d.f. is very accurate for N

32 ﬁber spans.

≥

In summary, this letter derives the asymptotic p.d.f. of nonlinear phase noise

when the number of ﬁber spans is very large. Gaussian approximation based solely

on the variance cannot use to predict the performance of the system accurately. The

nonlinear phase noise can be modeled accurately as the summation of a noncentral χ-

square random variable with two degrees of freedom and a Gaussian random variable.

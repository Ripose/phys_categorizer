Low-frequency measurements of electro-optic coeﬃcients and electrical conductivity
of KTiOPO4, Na:KTiOPO4, and RbTiOAsO4

We report the measurement of some of the r23 and r33 electro-optic coeﬃcients and of the z-axis
electrical conductivity of the nonlinear optical crystals KTiOPO4 (KTP), Na:KTP, and RbTiOAsO4
(RTA). We observed a marked decrease of the electro-optic eﬀect in the KTP crystals for frequencies
below 100 Hz. This eﬀect is absent in RTA. Additional measurements of the electrical conductivity
evidenced a non-ohmic behavior in KTP, which may be part of the explanation for the decrease of
the electro-optic eﬀect.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent work, our group demonstrated an ultrastable,
continuous-wave, nondegenerate optical parametric oscil-
lator (OPO), based on an x-cut Na:KTP crystal. The
frequency diﬀerence of the OPO signal and idler beams
was controlled to sub-hertz accuracy and continuously
tunable between 0 Hz and hundreds of MHz.[1] This was
achieved by electronically locking the optical phase diﬀer-
ence of the two OPO beams. In this lock, the correction
signal was sent to electrodes across the Na:KTP crys-
tal, generating a ﬁeld along its z axis. The electro-optic
(EO) eﬀect was thus used to tune the OPO frequencies to
exact degeneracy, thereby generating quantum mechan-
ically indistinguishable, photon-number correlated opti-
cal beams, which were used in the ﬁrst demonstration of
macroscopic Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference.[2]
In the course of this experiment, we observed an unex-
pected decrease of the EO tuning with the frequency of
the phase-lock error signal. This was tested by apply-
ing an EO sinusoidal modulation to the OPO crystal and
monitoring the resulting FM spectrum on the signal-idler
beat note, which revealed a dramatic diminution of the
modulation depth as the modulation frequency decreased
below a few kHz. This observation in our Na:KTP OPO
crystal provided the incentive for the present investiga-
tion of the EO eﬀect at low frequencies in ﬂux-grown
KTP, Na:KTP, and RTA.

We used two methods to measure the dependence of
the electro-optic coeﬃcients on the frequency of the ap-
plied ﬁeld. In the ﬁrst method, the crystal was placed
inside an optical resonator and the EO eﬀect was easily
observed by measuring the cavity resonance shift with
an oscilloscope. The EO coeﬃcients r23 and r33 of the
crystal were then individually measured by polarizing the
input light ﬁeld along the y and z axes of the crystal, re-
spectively. Although sensitive, due to the ampliﬁcation
of the EO eﬀect from the multiple passes of the resonant
ﬁeld through crystal, this measurement of the resonance

shift was nevertheless fairly noisy. We therefore used an
ellipsometry setup in order to conﬁrm the initial results.
This ellipsometry measurement was more precise than
the ﬁrst method, even though it only enabled access to
the composite EO coeﬃcient n3
yr23. The two
methods produced consistent results for Na:KTP.

Finally, in order to investigate the possible correlation
of the EO coeﬃcient frequency dependence with ion cur-
rents in the crystals, we measured the electrical conduc-
tivity of the crystals along their z-axis, by using an auto-
balancing bridge.[3] In Section 2, the experimental setups
and results are presented. We then conclude in Section
3.

light at λ = 532 nm was emitted by a frequency-doubled

142). We used an x-cut, 5 mm

Associates and AR coated at 1064 and 532 nm. The

voltage was applied to the top and bottom x-y surfaces
of the crystal, onto which were attached Copper foil elec-
trodes. Hence, an electric ﬁeld Ez was established along
the z crystal axis. The cavity’s optical length is

where k = y, z, depending on the polarization of the

the index of refraction. The cavity free spectral range is

Using Eqs. (3,4) in the previous equation, one obtains

Since the EO eﬀect is small, one can write the cavity
resonance change as

the Na:KTP EO coeﬃcients |r23|, |r33|, versus EO modulation
frequency.

The modulation amplitudes δνk and the free spectral
ranges ∆k are measured on a digital oscilloscope, tak-
ing great care not to choose commensurable frequencies
for the ﬁeld modulation and the PZT scan. The free
spectral ranges for diﬀerent light polarizations are taken
equal to ﬁrst-order approximation.

Figure 2 displays the measurement results. One clearly
sees that the EO coeﬃcients of Na:KTP drop sharply
when the frequency of the applied electric ﬁeld is below
20Hz. At higher frequencies, the measured values for
r23 and r33 in Fig. 2 are in agreement with the respective
values of 15.7 pm/V and 36.3 pm/V, previously measured
at 633 nm for KTP.[5]

Although giving access to the individual EO coeﬃ-
cients, this method is fairly noisy and inconvenient (it
could be improved by use of lock-in detection, for ex-
ample). In order to be able to conveniently study and
compare diﬀerent crystals, we subsequently adopted a
diﬀerent approach.

B. Ellipsometry measurements in Na:KTP, KTP,
and RTA

The experimental setup is shown in Fig.3. The polar-

ization of the incident light is now linear at a 45o an-
gle from y and z. The relative phase shift between the
two polarizations yields an elliptically polarized beam.
Crossed polarizers thus allow us to measure the changes
of the degree of ellipticity caused by the EO modulation
in the crystal. For an input ﬁeld

In all KTP crystals, the EO eﬀect is seen to disappear
at low frequency. In addition, results of Fig. 2 have been
plotted on Fig.4 for comparison: it is clear that the two
methods give consistent results. Undoped KTP seems to
display an even lower EO eﬀect than Na:KTP, whereas
RTA, remarkably, has a quasi constant EO eﬀect at all
frequencies. We also found that the measured value of

It is well known that RTA has a much lower ionic
conductivity than ﬂux-grown KTP.[5] To conﬁrm this,
we decided to measure the electrical conductivity of our
samples. Our initial hypothesis was that the KTP crys-
tals would become more conductive at lower frequencies,
thereby allowing for a decrease of the internal ﬁeld in the
crystal and therefore of the EO index change.

where C is the capacity of the crystal, S its x-y face area,
and L its thickness. One would therefore expect to see
a slope change in the measurement data, if the capac-
ity were changing. Figure 6 displays the measurement
results for frequencies above 500 Hz. Our simple mea-
surement technique did not allow us to obtain decent
enough signal-to-noise ratio for lower frequencies. For
all crystals, the slope of the conductivity is found to be
constant. Unsurprisingly, the RTA sample exhibited the
lowest conductivity. No capacity change could be seen,
even for the KTP crystal for which the EO eﬀect drops
at a few kHz, well above 500 Hz. However, the exis-
tence of nonzero ordinate intercepts in Fig.6 indicates the
non-Ohmic nature of KTP and Na:KTP crystals at low
frequencies: one could therefore still be in the presence
of site-hopping K+ ion currents, which would eﬀectively
decrease the internal electric ﬁeld and thereby the EO
eﬀect.

III. CONCLUSION

C. Electrical conductivity measurements in
Na:KTP, KTP, and RTA

Use was made of an auto-balancing bridge circuit
based on a low-noise OPA134PA operational ampliﬁer
(Fig.5).[3] The alternate input resistor r was used for

We have observed a decrease of the EO eﬃciency below
100 Hz modulation frequency for KTP and Na:KTP crys-
tals. RTA crystals do not show this eﬀect. Measurements
of the electrical conductivity did not show any related
variation, in particular for the KTP crystal in which the
EO eﬀect decreased well in the range of the conductiv-
ity measurements. We hypothesize that an explanation

4

for this decrease in the electro-optic eﬀect might still be
related to internal ﬁeld decrease due to ion migration in
the crystal, but of a non-ohmic nature. These results are
of importance for the realization of ultrastable OPO’s
for quantum optics applications, including continuous-
variable entanglers for quantum information[6] and ul-
traprecise measurements.[7] We ﬁnd that RTA (or peri-
odically poled RTA) crystals are better suited than KTP
for these systems, with similar nonlinear coeﬃcients and
no EO abnormalities.

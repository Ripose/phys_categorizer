The backward scattering of TM-polarized light by a two-side-open subwavelength slit in a metal
ﬁlm is analyzed. We show that the reﬂection coeﬃcient versus wavelength possesses a Fabry-Perot-
like dependence that is similar to the anomalous behavior of transmission reported in the study
[Y. Takakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5601 (2001)]. The open slit totally reﬂects the light at the
near-to-resonance wavelengths. In addition, we show that the interference of incident and resonantly
backward-scattered light produces in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone a spatially localized wave whose
intensity is 10 − 103 times greater than the incident wave, but one order of magnitude smaller than
the intra-cavity intensity. The amplitude and phase of the resonant wave at the slit entrance and
exit are diﬀerent from that of a Fabry-Perot cavity.

INTRODUCTION

uide modes giving a Fabry-Perot-like behavior.20,21,36
In the case of ﬁlms, whose thickness are too small to
support the intra-cavity resonance, the extraordinary
transmission can be caused by another mechanism, the
generation of resonant surface plasmon polaritons and
coupling of them into radiation.11,16,22 Both physical
mechanisms play important roles in the extraordinary
transmission through arrays of two-side-open slits (trans-
mission gratings) and the anomalous reﬂection by arrays
of one-side-open slits (reﬂection gratings) . A model of
trapped (waveguide) modes has been recently used to
show that an array of two-side-open slits can operate
like a reﬂection grating totally reﬂecting TE-polarized
light.37 The surface plasmons and Rayleigh anomalies
were involved in explanation of reﬂective properties of
such kind of a grating.29

The most impressive features of light scattering by
subwavelength metallic nanostructures are resonant
enhancement and localization of the light by excita-
tion of electron waves in the metal (for example, see
refs.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40).
In the last few years, a great number of studies have been
devoted to the 2D nanostructures in metal ﬁlms, namely
a single slit, a grating of slits and a slit surrounded by
parallel grooves. The localization and enhancement of
light by a single slit1,2,3 can be used in NSOM4,5,6,7.
The extraordinary (resonantly enhanced) transmission
of light through a grating of slits or a slit surrounded
by grooves is expected to ﬁnd numerous applications in
nanophotonics.8,9,10 For instance, a nanoslit ﬂanked by a
ﬁnite array of grooves can act as a lens focusing a light or
can produce a µm-size beam that spreads to an angle of
only few degrees.10,11,12 The quasi-diﬀraction-free beam
optics based on the light transmission through nanoslits
was suggested to extend the physical principle of a 2D
NSOM to the not-too-distant far-ﬁeld regime.14 The
high-throughput wavelength selective gratings can be
used in photolithography and many kinds of sensors and
actuators.8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37

The studies20,21,23,36 have pointed out that the ori-
gin of anomalous scattering of light by a grating of slits
(holes) can be better understood by clarifying the trans-
mission and reﬂection properties of a single subwave-
length slit. Along this direction, it was already demon-
strated that the intensity of TM-polarized light reso-
103
nantly transmitting through a single slit can be 10
times higher than the incident wave2,3,36 and that the
transmission coeﬃcient versus wavelength possesses a
Fabry-Perot-like behavior20,36. Unfortunately, the reﬂec-
tion properties of the slit have received no attention in the
literature. The very recent study37 only concerned the
problem by regarding the total reﬂection of TE-polarized
light by a grating of two-side-open slits to properties of
the independent slit emitters.

subwavelength apertures

Since the paper8 of Ebbesen and colleagues on
the light anomalous transmission observed for a 2D
in metal ﬁlms,
array of
the phenomenon is
intensively discussed in the
literature.8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37
In the case of a slit array in a thick metal ﬁlm, the
transmission exhibits enhancement due to a pure geo-
metrical reason, the resonant excitation of propagating
TM-modes inside the slit waveguide.16,18,22 At the
resonant wavelengths, the transmitted ﬁeld increases via
the strong coupling of an incident wave with the waveg-

In this article, the backward scattering of light by a
two-side-open subwavelength slit is analyzed. To com-
pare properties of the light reﬂection with the extraor-
dinary transmission20,36 , we consider the scattering of
TM-polarized light by a slit in a thick metallic ﬁlm of

−

perfect conductivity. The traditional approach based on
the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solutions of Maxwell’s equations is
used in the computations.1,2,3 The article is organized as
follows. The theoretical background, numerical analysis
and discussion are presented in Section II. The summary
and conclusions are given in Section III. The detailed
model and method of solution of the Neerhoﬀ and Mur
integral equations are presented in the Appendix.

II. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

It is well known that when a light scattered by a sub-
wavelength metallic object, a signiﬁcant part of the inci-
dent light can be scattered backward (reﬂected) whatever
the object be reﬂecting or transparent. It was recently
demonstrated that an array of a two-side-open subwave-
length metallic slits eﬀectively reﬂects light waves at the
appropriate resonant conditions.29,37 One may suppose
that this is true also in the case of a single slit. In this
section, we test whether a light wave can be resonantly re-
ﬂected by a single two-side-open subwavelength metallic
slit. To address this question, the energy ﬂux in front of
the slit is analyzed numerically under various regimes of
the light scattering. In order to compare properties of the
light reﬂection with that of the extraordinary (resonant)
transmission20,21,36, we consider the zero-order scatter-
ing of a time-harmonic wave of TM-polarized light by a
thick slit in a perfectly conducting metal ﬁlm placed in
vacuum. The energy ﬂux ~SI in front of the slit is com-
pared with the ﬂuxes ~SII and ~SIII inside the slit and
behind the slit, respectively. The amplitude and phase
of the light wave at the slit entrance and exit are com-
pared with that of a Fabry-Perot cavity. The electric ~E
and magnetic ~H ﬁelds of the light are computed by us-
ing the traditional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ and
Mur solutions of Maxwell’s equations.1,2,3 The detailed
description of the model and the method of solution of
the Neerhoﬀ and Mur integral equations are presented in
the Appendix.

According to the model, the electric ~E(x, z) and mag-
netic ~H(x, z) ﬁelds in front of the slit (region I), inside the
slit (region II) and behind the slit (region III) are deter-
mined by the scalar ﬁelds U1(x, z), U2(x, z) and U3(x, z),
respectively. The scalar ﬁelds are found by solving the
Neerhoﬀ and Mur integral equations. The time averaged
Poynting vector (energy ﬂux) ~S of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is given by ~S = (c/16π)( ~E
~H). In front of
the slit, the ﬁeld U1(x, z) = U i(x, z)+U r(x, z)+U d(x, z).
The ﬁeld U i(x, z) = exp (
ikz) represents the incident
−
ﬁeld, which is assumed to be a plane wave of unit ampli-
tude; U r(x, z) = U i(x, 2b
z) denotes the ﬁeld that would
be reﬂected if there were no slit in the ﬁlm; U d(x, z)
describes the backward diﬀracted ﬁeld due to the pres-
ence of the slit. The reﬂection coeﬃcient R = Srd
int is
n = Srd/Si integrated
given by the normalized ﬂux Srd
over the slit width 2a at the slit entrance (z = b), where

Srd is the z component of the backward scattered ﬂux,
and Si is the incident ﬂux along the z direction. The
ﬂux Srd = Srd(U r, U d) is produced by the interference
of the backward scattered ﬁelds U r(x, z) and U d(x, z).
The transmission coeﬃcient T = S3
int(b) is determined
by the normalized ﬂux S3
n = S3/Si integrated over the
slit at the slit exit (z = 0), where the ﬂux z-component
S3 = S3(U 3) is produced by the forward scattered (trans-
mitted) ﬁeld U 3(x, z). In the following analysis, the R

We have analyzed the backward scattering of light
for the wide range of scattering conditions determined
by values of the wavelength λ, slit width 2a and ﬁlm

R = Srd
int(b) as a function of the ﬁlm thickness b com-
puted for the wavelength λ = 800 nm and the slit width
2a = 25 nm is shown in Fig. 1(a). The transmission coef-
ﬁcient T = S3

agreement with the previous results20,21,36, we see also
the transmission resonances having the same period and
the peak heights T
It is
worth to note the correlation between the positions of
maximums and minimums in the reﬂection and trans-
mission. The resonance positions for the total reﬂec-
tion are somewhat left-shifted with respect to the trans-
mission resonances. The maximums of the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient correspond to the reﬂection minimums.
To clarify a role of the ﬁelds U i, U r, U d and U 3 in
the resonant backward scattering, we compared the in-
tegrated ﬂux Sird
int(U d)
int (U i, U r, U d) with the ﬂuxes Sd
int(U 3) = T . As can be seen from Fig. 1(a),
and S3
the ﬂux Sird
int produced in front of the slit by interfer-
ence of the incident ﬁeld U i(x, z) and backward scattered
ﬁelds U r(x, z) and U d(x, z) is practically undistinguish-
able from that generated by the backward diﬀracted ﬁeld
U d and forward scattered (transmitted) ﬁeld U 3. The in-
tegrated ﬂux Sird
int (a, b) as a function of the slit half-width
a and ﬁlm thickness b is shown in Fig. 1(b). We no-
tice that the widths and shifts of the resonances increase
with decreasing the value a. Analysis of Fig. 1(a) indi-
cates that the diﬀerence between the integrated ﬂuxes
int(U 3) = T appears due to the
int(U r, U d) = R and S3

interference of the backward diﬀracted ﬁeld U d(x, z) and
the reﬂected ﬁeld U r(x, z). Because of the interference,
the maximums in transmission are accompanied by the
minimums in the reﬂection.

sion peaks, the slit forms very wide reﬂection bands. At

well with the results2,3,36. It is worth to note the corre-
lation between the wavelengths for maximums and mini-
mums in the reﬂection R(λ) and transmission T (λ). The
resonance wavelengths for the total reﬂection are some-
what red-shifted with respect to the transmission reso-
nances. To understand the physical mechanism of the

connection that the behaviors of R(λ) and T (λ) are sim-
ilar to that observed in the case29 of excitation of surface
plasmons in an array of slit in a thin metal ﬁlm.

In the study29, the minimums in reﬂection spectra cor-
responding to the maximums in the transmission spec-
tra were attributed to the redistribution of the energy of
diﬀracted evanescent order into the propagating order.
In the case of a thick ﬁlm, we explain such a behavior
by another physical mechanism, the interference of the
backward diﬀracted ﬁeld U d(x, z) and the reﬂected ﬁeld
U r(x, z). It can be noted that the total reﬂection (see,
Figs. 1(a) and 2(a)) compare well also with the total re-
ﬂection eﬀect predicted by the study37 for TE-polarized
light scattered by a grating of two-side-open slits in a
thick metal ﬁlm. However, the dispersions R(λ) and
T (λ) are in contrast to the relation R(λ) + T (λ) = 1
and the positions of reﬂection minimums and transmis-
sion maximums derived in the study37. The diﬀerence
can be perhaps attributed to the boundary conditions
used in the study37 for the TE polarization. Indeed, in
our model we consider the incident wave with TM polar-
ization. According to the theory of waveguides, the vec-
torial wave equations for this polarization can be reduced
to one scalar equation describing the magnetic ﬁeld H of
TM modes. The electric component E of these modes is
found using the ﬁeld H and Maxwell’s equations. The
TM scalar equation for the component H is decoupled
from the similar scalar equation describing the ﬁeld E
of TE (transverse electric) modes. Hence, the formalism
works analogously for TE polarization exchanging the E
and H ﬁelds. The symmetry, however, is broken by us-
ing the diﬀerent boundary conditions for the TM and TE
polarizations.

amplitude and phase of the light wave at the resonant
and near-resonant wavelengths inside and outside the slit

However, in contrast to the Fabry-Perot-like modal dis-
tributions, the resonant conﬁgurations are characterized
by antinodes of the electric ﬁeld at each open aperture
of the slit. Such a behavior is in agreement with the
results18. It is interesting that at the slit entrance and
exit, the amplitudes Ex of the resonant ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tions possess the Fabry-Perot-like phase shifts on the val-
ues of π and 2π, respectively (Fig. 3). The integrated

10

In the present paper, the backward scattering of TM-
polarized light by a two-side-open subwavelength slit in
a metal ﬁlm has been analyzed. We predict that the re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient versus wavelength possesses a Fabry-
Perot-like dependence that is similar to the anomalous
behavior of transmission. The open slit totally reﬂects
the light at the near-to-resonance wavelengths. The res-
onance wavelengths for the total reﬂection are somewhat
red-shifted with respect to the transmission resonances.
The sharp resonant maximums of transmission are ac-
companied by the wide minimums of the reﬂection. In
addition, we showed that the interference of incident and
resonantly backward-scattered light produces in the near-
ﬁeld diﬀraction zone a strongly localized wave whose
intensity is greater than the incident wave by a factor
103 and about one order of magnitude
λ/2πa
smaller than the intra-cavity intensity. The correlation
between the amplitude and phase distributions of light
waves inside and outside the slit was also investigated.
The slit cavity was compared with a Fabry-Perot res-
onator. We showed that the amplitude and phase of the
resonant wave at the slit entrance and exit are diﬀerent
from that of a Fabry-Perot cavity. The physical mecha-
nism responsible for the total reﬂection is the interplay of
the backward diﬀracted ﬁeld U d(x, z) and the reﬂected
~H)
ﬁeld U r(x, z) in the energy ﬂux ~S
at the near-to-resonance wavelengths. The wavelength-
selective total reﬂection of light by two-side-open metal
slits may ﬁnd application in many kinds of sensors and
105)-times
actuators. The (10
enhancement of the light intensity in front of the slit and
inside the slit can be used in reﬂective nanooptics and
in intra-cavity spectroscopy of single atoms. We believe
that the presented results gains insight into the physics of
resonant scattering of light by subwavelength nano-slits
in metal ﬁlms.

Appendix

We brieﬂy summarize

the Neerhoﬀ and Mur
formulation1,3 describing the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of a
plane continuous wave by a subwavelength slit of width
2a in a perfectly conducting metal screen of thickness b.
The slit is illuminated by a normally incident plane
wave under TM polarization (magnetic-ﬁeld vector par-
allel to the slit), as shown in Fig. 5. The magnetic ﬁeld
of the wave is assumed to be time harmonic and constant
in the y direction:

~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x, z)exp(

iωt)~ey.

(1)

The electric ﬁeld of the wave is found from the scalar
ﬁeld U (x, z) using Maxwell’s equations. The restrictions
in Eq. 1 reduce the diﬀraction problem to one involving
a single scalar ﬁeld U (x, z) in two dimensions. The ﬁeld
is represented by Uj(x, z) (j=1,2,3 in region I, II and
III, respectively), and satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation:
j )Uj = 0, where j = 1, 2, 3. In region I, the ﬁeld

where γm = [k2
(mπ/2a)2]1/2. The ﬁeld can be found
at any point once the four unknown functions in Eqs. 7-
10 have been determined. The functions are completely
determined by a set of the four integral equations:

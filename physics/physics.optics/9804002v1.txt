Abstract

The ampliﬁed spontaneous emission spectrum of the light ﬁeld in the non-
lasing supermode of two coupled semiconductor lasers is analyzed using lin-
earized Langevin equations.
It is shown that the interference between the
laser mode and the ﬂuctuating light ﬁeld in the non-lasing mode causes spa-
tial holeburning. This eﬀect introduces a phase sensitive coupling between
the laser ﬁeld and the ﬂuctuations of the non-lasing mode. For high laser
ﬁelds, this coupling splits the spectrum of the non-lasing mode into a triplet
consisting of two relaxation oscillation sidebands which are in phase with the
laser light and a center line at the lasing frequency with a phase shift of
π/2
relative to the laser light. As the laser intensity is increased close to threshold,
the spectrum shows a continuous transition from the single ampliﬁed spon-
taneous emission line at the frequency of the non-lasing mode to the triplet
structure. An analytical expression for this transition is derived and typical
features are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The carrier density dynamics of semiconductor lasers couple not only to the lasing modes,
but also modify the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission into the non-lasing modes. It is there-
fore possible to gain interesting insights into holeburning eﬀects by studying the light ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing modes [1–4]. The most simple system which can exhibit hole-
burning eﬀects is a laser array in which each of the individual lasers can be considered to
operate in a single mode which is coupled to the local carrier density of that individual laser.
A rate equation description for this type of device was developed by Winful and Wang [5,6]
and has been discussed in a more general context by the authors [4]. In the following, this
model will be referred to as the split density model since the characteristic feature of the
model is the separation of the carrier density into distinct density pools associated with the
individual lasers in the array. Originally, the split density model was intended to describe
instabilities in semiconductor laser arrays. Indeed, the model for a two laser array exhibits
a region of instability with a limit cycle [5]. However, the model can also describe the stable
anti-phase locking between neighboring lasers in an array. This type of anti-phase locking
is commonly observed in vertical cavity surface emitting laser arrays [7–10]. In particular,
the presence of carrier diﬀusion leading to a stochastical exchange of carriers between the
lasers was found to enhance the stability of the anti-phase locking considerably [4]. In the
case of stable anti-phase locked operation, the special features of the model are still present
in the dynamics of the quantum ﬂuctuations causing ampliﬁed spontaneous emission in
the non-lasing modes of the array. Speciﬁcally, the spatial holeburning represented by the
carrier density diﬀerence between individual lasers is part of the ﬂuctuation dynamics, mod-
ifying the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission spectrum in the non-lasing modes according to
this coupling between the light ﬁeld and the carrier density dynamics [11].

In section II, we introduce the split density model for two lasers operating in the anti-
symmetric supermode. The Langevin equation for the light ﬁeld in the non-lasing mode is
derived and the eﬀects of spatial holeburning on the ﬂuctuation dynamics are discussed.

In section III, the Langevin equation is solved and the analytic expression of the spectrum

is derived. General features of the spectrum are discussed.

In section IV, the spectra of four typical cases are presented, illustrating the diﬀerent
spatial holeburning features which may arise in diﬀerent types of semiconductor array de-
vices.

II. SPLIT DENSITY MODEL OF A TWO LASER ARRAY

A. Rate equations

Generally a semiconductor laser array can exhibit a large range of dynamical eﬀects
involving far more than just two light ﬁeld modes and two spatially separated carrier systems.
However, the region of stable anti-phase locked operation relevant for at least some of the
experimental realizations [7–10] can be described realistically by a split density model limited
to only two light ﬁeld modes and two carrier densities. The consistency of such a description
with a more detailed model based on partial diﬀerential equations has been established in
[12]. We will use a version of the model which includes both the possibility of carrier diﬀusion

2

and of a diﬀerence in the cavity loss rate between the symmetric and the antisymmetric
supermodes. The rate equations read

where E1, E2 are the ﬁeld amplitudes of the individual lasers, normalized so that the inten-
sities E∗
2E2 correspond to photon numbers in the cavity and N1, N2 are the carrier
densities above transparency in the active media of laser one and two, respectively, each nor-
malized to represent the actual number of carriers in the laser. The total carrier injection
rate µ is split equally between the two carrier pools. The linear gain coeﬃcient w is then
equal to the spontaneous emission rate into the laser mode. The rate of carrier losses due to
electron-hole recombinations by spontaneous emission into modes not conﬁned to the cavity
is given by γ. The properties of the individual laser cavities are given by the frequency at
transparency ¯ω and the cavity loss rate ¯κ. The carrier density dependent frequency change
is represented by the linewidth enhancement factor α.

The coupling between the two lasers is described in terms of the parameters Γ, s and
Ω. The carrier diﬀusion rate Γ represents diﬀusive carrier exchange between the two lasers
which tends to equilibrate the carrier densities in the two regions of the gain medium. Γ may
be derived from the ambipolar diﬀusion constant of the carriers, Ddif f , and the distance r
between the two lasers, resulting in

Γ = 4π2 Ddiﬀ
r2

.

Note that the consideration of carrier diﬀusion eﬀects represents an extension of the orig-
inal model of Winful and Wang [4,5]. The dissipative optical coupling term s represents
additional optical losses in the region between the two lasers, where the two ﬁeld modes
interfere. Constructive interference (E1 has the same phase as E2) thus leads to increased
losses, while destructive interference (phase diﬀerence of π and, therefore, opposite sign)
leads to reduced losses. This coupling mechanism is itself suﬃcient to explain anti-phase
locking [2,7]. The particular physical explanation associated with this term in a real laser
device depends on the type of waveguiding mechanisms used to separate the two lasers. In
gain guided twin stripe arrays, the additional losses are due to internal absorption in the
region of negative gain between the lasers. In vertical cavity surface emitting laser arrays
fabricated by destroying the Bragg mirrors between the lasers [7], this term represents the
increased light emission from the cavity in that region. The coherent coupling of the two
localized ﬁeld modes by optical diﬀraction is represented by Ω, the frequency diﬀerence
between the symmetric and the anti-symmetric supermodes in the cavity at N1 = N2.

Since this model represents a perfectly symmetric array of two lasers, it is useful to
express the dynamics in terms of the symmetric and the anti-symmetric supermode, E+ =

1/√2(E1 + E2) and E− = 1/√2(E1 −

N2. The equations then read

B. Fluctuation dynamics

If the eﬀects of spatial holeburning are neglected by omitting all terms which depend
on ∆, the stable solution is given by E+ = 0, since κ+ > κ−. Therefore, only the anti-
symmetric supermode will show laser activity. In the presence of a non-vanishing spatial
holeburning variable ∆, the stability analysis becomes more involved, as will be discussed
below. However, there is always a stationary solution with

where I0 is the total laser intensity in terms of the photon number in the anti-symmetric
supermode. The linearized dynamics of small ﬂuctuations around this stationary solution
may be separated into the relaxation oscillations of the laser mode and the ﬂuctuations in the
non-lasing mode and the holeburning parameter. This independence of the linear dynamics
in E+ and ∆ from ﬂuctuations in E− and N is a consequence of the fact that E− = ∆ = 0 is
stationary for all values of E+ and N. Only the relaxation and oscillation rates of the small
ﬂuctuations in E+ and ∆ are altered by E+ and N. Therefore, the ﬂuctuations in E+ and
N appear only in the quadratic terms of the ﬂuctuation dynamics, as products with ∆ and
E+, respectively.

While the linearized ﬂuctuations in the lasing mode describe the unaltered relaxation
oscillations of a single mode laser, the ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing mode are described by

Note that the ﬂuctuation dynamics can be written using δE+ = E+ and δ∆ = ∆ because
the averages of the non-lasing ﬁeld mode E+ and the holeburning parameter∆ are zero.

Both the amplitude √I0 and the phase

(ω− + ακ−)t of the average laser ﬁeld appear
−
in the ﬂuctuation dynamics, representing the hole burning eﬀects of the interference term
between the weak non-lasing mode and the laser ﬁeld. Thus the ﬂuctuation dynamics are not
independent of the phase of E+. The phase sensitivity can be represented in the ﬂuctuation
dynamics by expressing the complex ﬁeld amplitude E+ in terms of the component fk in
phase with the laser ﬁeld and the component f⊥ which is π/2 out of phase with the laser
ﬁeld, i.e.

E+ = (fk −

i(ω− + ακ−)t].

The ﬂuctuation dynamics can now be rewritten as a linear matrix equation in a real three
dimensional space. Adding the quantum noise terms Q⊥ and Qk, one obtains the linearized
Langevin equation of the ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing mode,

The quantum noise terms include quantum ﬂuctuations of the light ﬁeld vacuum entering
the cavity and the dipole ﬂuctuations of the gain medium. Here we have neglected the shot
noise terms acting on the carrier density diﬀerence ∆. This assumption can be well justiﬁed
in the case of ¯κ > γ, where within an order of magnitude of the threshold current the total
number of carriers in the gain medium is much larger than the number of photons in the
cavity . The relative shot noise in the carrier system will therefore be much lower than the
photonic shot noise in the light ﬁeld system. Note that the presence of relaxation oscillations
is an indicator that this assumption is valid. The limit of its validity is reached when the
stimulated emission overdamps the relaxation oscillations.

The quantitative expression for the optical quantum noise terms Qk and Q⊥ may be
derived by comparing the corresponding intensity noise with the expected shot noise for
the quantized processes. The vacuum noise entering the cavity thus corresponds to the
quantization of photons emitted from the cavity and the dipole noise in the gain medium
corresponds to the quantization of photon emission from the gain medium into the cavity.
Note that reabsorption of photons due to incomplete inversion may add extra noise. In the
following, however, we assume perfect inversion in the gain medium by using the minimum
noise terms required by quantum mechanics,

0), the light ﬁeld
dynamics are governed by the frequency Ω representing the frequency diﬀerence between
the supermodes and the damping coeﬃcient s representing the loss rate diﬀerence between
the supermodes. The interference eﬀects between the laser ﬁeld and the light ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations in the non-lasing mode couple the holeburning parameter ∆ to the ﬁeld dynamics
of the non-lasing mode. The total coupling strength is given by the relaxation oscillation

In the case of weak laser light (I0 ≈

frequency √2κ−wI0. The damping of the holeburning parameter ∆ is given by the sum of
the spontaneous emission rate γ, the Diﬀusion rate 2Γ and the rate of stimulated emission
wI0.

To illustrate the physical processes involved in the coupling between the spatial holeburn-
ing parameter ∆ and the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing mode, it is useful to examine the
real time dynamics of the ﬂuctuations in fk and f⊥ for large intensities I0. If √2κ−wI0 ≫
Ω,
relaxation oscillations dominate the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations. However, since the hole-
burning is only caused by the ﬁeld ﬂuctuation fk which are in phase with the laser ﬁeld, any
ﬂuctuations in f⊥ will not cause oscillations. Instead, f⊥ relaxes exponentially with

f⊥ ≈

f0e−(s+αΩ)t.

(9)

The eﬀect of the frequency diﬀerence Ω is suppressed by the fast relaxation oscillations and
would not have any inﬂuence on the dynamics if it were not for the phenomena expressed by
the linewidth enhancement factor α. The α factor describes waveguiding properties induced
by spatial holeburning. If a carrier density diﬀerence ∆ exists between the two cavities, α
induces a change in the relative phase between the local ﬁelds E1 and E2. In terms of the
supermodes, this means that the components of E− and E+ which are out of phase by π/2
are coupled. Therefore, ∆ causes a change in f⊥ via α by coherently converting part of the
laser light amplitude into the non-lasing mode. In the presence of a strong laser ﬁeld, even
the negligibly small holeburning caused as Ω rotates f⊥ into fk is suﬃcient to diminish f⊥
by destructive interference with the light coherently transferred from the laser mode.

In the relaxation oscillations caused by the spatial holeburning eﬀect of interference
between the laser light and in-phase ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing modes, the α factor
produces an out-of-phase component of α times the in-phase ﬂuctuation, i.e. f⊥ = αfk.
Also, some of the ﬁeld in f⊥ is rotated into fk by the frequency diﬀerence Ω to cause
an eﬀective undamping of the oscillations. Note that this is the exact counterpart of the
additional damping in the exponential decay of f⊥. The real time evolution of the relaxation
oscillations reads

If the dynamics are dominated by the relaxation oscillations, the exponentially damped
dynamics of f⊥ should produce a Lorentzian line at the laser frequency with a width of
2s + 2αΩ in the spectrum of the non-lasing mode, while the relaxation oscillation dynamics
should form two sidebands shifted from the laser line by the relaxation oscillation frequency
and having a width of γ + 2Γ + wI0 + s
αΩ. If the α factor was zero, these sidebands
would be fully symmetric. The main eﬀect of α is to correlate the ﬂuctuations in fk with
the ﬂuctuations in f⊥ as expressed in equation (10). If the relaxation starts at fk = f0 and
f⊥ = 0, the total relaxation dynamics are given by

Figure 1 shows this relaxation trajectory for a typical choice of laser parameters. The ques-
tion of whether this trajectory contributes to a high frequency line or to a low frequency line
depends on its curvature. The parts of the trajectory curved left rotate counterclockwise and
contribute mainly to the low frequency line, while those parts curved right rotate clockwise
and therefore contribute mainly to the high frequency line. Note that the sections of the tra-
jectory contributing mainly to the low frequency sideband are signiﬁcantly longer than the
sections contributing mainly to the high frequency sideband. It is therefore to be expected
that the high frequency sideband is lower than the low frequency sideband because of the
α factor correlation between the relaxation oscillations along f⊥ = αfk and the exponential
relaxation along fk = 0.

If αΩ is larger than γ + 2Γ + s the relaxation oscillations may become undamped for
intensities wI0 < αΩ
s. However, as the relaxation oscillations are slower at low
s as predicted
intensities wI0, this eﬀect does not necessarily occur at wI0 = αΩ
by equation (10). To ﬁnd the correct stability boundaries, we will in the following examine
the stability condition of the complete ﬂuctuation dynamics given by S.

examination of the stability boundary is of interest in the present context. In particular, it
is possible to determine the condition for no instability at any laser intensity,

III. SPECTRUM OF THE NON-LASING SUPERMODE

A. General formula

The Langevin equation (7) can be solved analytically in the frequency regime by de-
termining the Greensfunction corresponding to the dynamical matrix S and applying it to
the white noise input. The Greensfunction is obtained by inverting the matrix S + iω. In
the two dimensional subspace describing only the optical ﬁeld components fk and f⊥, the
Greensfunction of the two density model is

(16)

Note that M is a complex function of ω and I0 which includes all parameters associated
with the carrier dynamics. For M = 0, the Greensfunction is that of a cavity mode with
Ω relative to the laser line and a damping rate of s. M increases with
a frequency of
increasing laser intensity I0, describing the transition from the cavity resonance to relaxation
oscillations.

B. General properties of the spectrum

To understand the physical processes associated with the spectrum described by the
general formula given in equation (19), it is helpful to discuss the two limiting cases given
by M = 0 and M
. For M = 0, equation (19) describes the ampliﬁed spontaneous
emission spectrum expected without spatial holeburning at a total carrier density pinned to

Here, the total photon number in the non-lasing cavity mode is given by κ−/s. In this case,
no phase relation exists between the non-lasing mode and the lasing mode. In the opposite
limit, i.e. M
, only the component of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission out of phase with
the laser mode remains undamped by the high stimulated emission rate and the spectrum
shows a single line at the laser frequency ω = 0,

For M
the total photon number in the non-lasing supermode corresponding to this
spectrum is κ−(1 + α2)/2(s + αΩ). For α = 0, this intensity is one half of the intensity at
M = 0, reﬂecting the suppression of out-of-phase emissions. The linewidth enhancement
factor α changes this simple situation however. It enhances the noise eﬀect by a factor of
1 + α2. This is the same mechanism which enhances the phase noise in the laser light and
therefore increases the linewidth of the laser line. Moreover, α introduces an additional
damping eﬀect of αΩ, which makes this line wider than the one for M = 0 and reduces the
total photon number accordingly.

The typical spectra pertaining to values of the complex rate M between these two ex-
tremes are triplet spectra. The case described by equations (10) features not only the
centerline corresponding to M
, but also a pair of relaxation oscillation sidebands
corresponding to the in-phase component of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission. In the limit
of fast relaxation oscillations assumed in equations (10), the sidebands are centered around
√2κ−wI0. Therefore, the sidebands can be de-
the relaxation oscillation frequency ωR =
ωR in the vicinity of
rived from equation (19) by approximating the spectrum for large
ω = ωR. The result of this approximation, including the lowest order asymmetry between
the sidebands, reads

The sidebands are clearly damped by the stimulated emission into the laser line, wI0, as well
as by spontaneous recombinations and carrier diﬀusion expressed by γ + 2Γ. The increase
in the stimulated emission rate is responsible for the suppression of the sidebands with
increasing laser intensity. Note that the undamping of relaxation oscillations discussed in
section II also appears in the total intensity of the sidebands, possibly raising the sideband
intensities far above the intensity of the centerline at low laser intensities.

The asymmetry of the sidebands can be traced back to two separate contributions, one
proportional to the frequency diﬀerence between the modes Ω and one proportional to
α(s + γ + 2Γ + wI0). In both cases, the low frequency sideband intensity is greater than
the high frequency sideband intensity. The ﬁrst term can be understood as a remnant of
the cavity resonance of the non-lasing supermode in the absence of spatial holeburning.
The low frequency line continuously evolves from the line at ω =
Ω for M = 0 while
the high frequency line only emerges as the laser intensity is increased. However, the low
frequency line is also stronger for Ω = 0. This is the eﬀect explained in section II.B which
is caused by the α factor. Within the approximation assumed here, the sideband intensity
ratio corresponding to the parameters given in Figure 1 is about two to one.

−

While the general considerations given above already cover the qualitative eﬀects which
can be expected in the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission spectrum, the quantitative changes
in the spectrum as spatial holeburning eﬀects get stronger with increasing laser intensity are
best illustrated and discussed on spectra pertaining to typical examples of device parameters.
In the following, we will therefore discuss four cases, with either strong centerlines (Ω < s)
or weak centerline (Ω > s) and either low carrier diﬀusion (γ + 2Γ
κ−) or high carrier
diﬀusion (γ + 2Γ = κ−/2).

IV. EXAMPLES OF SPECTRA FOR TYPICAL DEVICE PARAMETERS

A. Triplet structure

A typical triplet structure can be observed in devices where the frequency diﬀerence Ω
is smaller than the dissipative optical coupling s. The intensity of the centerline is then
comparable to the intensity of the single line at M = 0. The carrier relaxation and diﬀusion
rate γ + 2Γ will suppress the sidebands, so a low value for this rate produces the strongest
possible sidebands. The evolution of the spectrum as a function of laser intensity for the
device parameters κ− = 400 GHz, s = 3 GHz, Ω = 1 GHz, γ + 2Γ = 10 GHz and α = 3 is
shown in Figure 2 and 3. The laser intensity is given in terms of the stimulated emission rate
wI0 which can be converted to units of threshold current by dividing wI0 by the spontaneous
emission rate γ. Since γ is usually close to one Gigahertz, realistic values for wI0 range from
about zero to ten Gigahertz.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the triplet structure with increasing intensity. Equation
(22) describes this evolution very well, except for the immediate vicinity of the threshold.

10

Note that the asymmetry of the sidebands is extremely strong. At wI0 = 1 GHz, the choice
of parameters corresponding to ﬁgure 1, the intensity ratio between the sidebands is about
two to one, as predicted by the approximate equation (22).

Figure 3 displays an enlarged part of ﬁgure 2 close to threshold.

In this region, the
triplet has not yet been formed. Between wI0 = 0 and wI0 = 0.03 GHz the maximum of the
single spectral line rapidly shifts to lower frequencies, increasing in intensity in the process.
Between wI0 = 0.03 GHz and wI0 = 0.15 GHz, the line widens and ﬁnally forms a plateau
on the low frequency side. At about wI0 = 0.25 GHz, the plateau on the low frequency side
splits from the center line to form the lower sideband. The high frequency sideband emerges
in a similar fashion between wI0 = 0.1 GHz and wI0 = 0.5 GHz.

B. Sideband suppression

Since the center line is only damped by the sum of rates s + αΩ while the sidebands are
additionally damped by carrier diﬀusion, the sidebands will be suppressed in the presence
of fast carrier diﬀusion. In this case, only a single line which gets frequency locked to the
laser frequency as the laser intensity increases remains in the spectrum. This eﬀect can
indeed be seen in the spectra by choosing the same parameters as for the triplet structure
(section IV A), κ− = 400 GHz, s = 3 GHz, Ω = 1 GHz and α = 3, except for an increased
carrier recombination and diﬀusion rate of γ + 2Γ = 200 GHz.

Figure 4 clearly shows the evolution of a single line. However, the peak frequency is not
just reduced to zero as the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission is phase locked to the laser light
by the increasingly strong spatial holeburning eﬀects. Instead, the peak even shifts to larger
negative frequencies just above threshold. Between wI0 = 0.5 GHz and wI0 = 1.0 GHz the
peak frequency is about 2 GHz, twice as large as the frequency at wI0 = 0. This shift to
higher frequency diﬀerences between the laser light and the non-lasing mode is similar to
the one observed in the case of low carrier diﬀusion discussed above. However, the shift is
not as rapid in the high diﬀusion case and instead extends to much higher laser intensities
wI0. In the vicinity of wI0 = 0, an analytical expression may be derived for the change in
peak position by considering the coupling terms between the holeburning parameter ∆ and
the ﬁeld components fk and f⊥ in the dynamical matrix S as weak perturbations. The peak
position ωp is given by the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of S. Near wI0 = 0 it shifts at
a rate of

d(ωp)
d(wI0)

=

ακ−
(γ + 2Γ)

.

(24)

Note that this equation generally applies to all parameter sets. However, in the case of
low carrier diﬀusion it is only valid extremely close to threshold. In particular, the shift of
d(ωp)/d(wI0) = 120 for the low diﬀusion case in ﬁgure 2 extends only to wI0 = 0.03 GHz.In
the low diﬀusion case displayed in ﬁgure 3 the shift of d(ωp)/d(wI0) = 6 is the dominant
feature of the spectrum up to intensities of wI0 = 0.4 GHz, and even at wI0 = 2 GHz the
peak of the line is still 1 GHz below the laser frequency. These features in the evolution of
the spectrum demonstrate how carrier diﬀusion suppresses the spatial holeburning eﬀects.
We note that a quantitative expression for the relative importance of spatial holeburning is
given by the complex rate M introduced in equation (16). It is the denominator of M which

11

includes the carrier diﬀusion rate 2Γ. Thus increased carrier diﬀusion reduces the absolute
value of M, thereby suppressing spatial holeburning eﬀects.

C. Undamped sidebands

If αΩ is larger than s+γ +2Γ, the undamping eﬀect may cause an instability as discussed
in section II. If the instability is only narrowly avoided by choosing parameters close to the
stability condition (15), the sidebands should grow large and become narrow as the laser
intensity passes the region of instability in the phase diagram. Figure 5 shows the phase
diagram for variable damping of the holeburning parameter, γ + 2Γ, and κ− = 100 GHz,
s = 5 GHz, Ω = 10 GHz, and α = 3. The horizontal line at γ + 2Γ = 15 GHz shows the
section of this phase diagram corresponding to the choice of parameters in ﬁgure 6. The
sidebands clearly have their maximum at a stimulated emission rate near wI0 = 5 GHz, the
point closest to the unstable region in the phase diagram. The linewidth of the sidebands
in this region is close to 1 GHz, as compared to the linewidth given by 2s = 10 GHz.
The maximal value of the total photon number in the non-lasing mode is roughly 240 at
wI0 = 5 GHz. For comparison, the total photon number at wI0 = 0 is 20 and the centerline
photon number for wI0 → ∞
is 14.3. The asymmetry of the lines is given by an intensity
ratio of about three to one, e.g. at wI0 = 5 GHz the photon numbers in the sidebands are
approximately 180 in the low frequency sideband and 60 in the high frequency sideband.

D. Sidebands in the presence of strong carrier diﬀusion eﬀects

If the carrier diﬀusion is increased, the undamping of the sidebands is suppressed. How-
ever, the sidebands still remain the dominant feature of the spectrum if the line at wI0 = 0
is well separated from the laser line by Ω > s. This eﬀect can be illustrated using the same
parameters as those in the case of undamped sidebands (section IV C), κ− = 100 GHz, s = 5
GHz, Ω = 10 GHz and α = 3, except for an increased carrier damping and diﬀusion rate of
γ + 2Γ = 50 GHz. As shown in ﬁgure 7, the low frequency sideband continuously evolves
from the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission line at threshold as intensity increases. Meanwhile,
the weak phase locking eﬀects cause a low intensity mirror image line to appear at the corre-
sponding position on the high frequency side. Note that the frequency separation from the
laser line increases from Ω = 10 GHz at wI0 = 0 to almost 40 GHz at wI0 = 10 GHz. The
relaxation oscillation frequency at wI0 = 10 GHz is about 45 GHz. This indicates that the
line at wI0 = 10 GHz is actually a relaxation oscillation line created by the carrier dynamics,
while the suppression of the high frequency sideband is not only an eﬀect of Ω but also of
the α factor as described by equation (11). Indeed, the approximation given by equation
(22) predicts an intensity ratio of twenty to one between the sidebands for the parameters
used here.

We have demonstrated that the spatial holeburning caused by interference between the
laser light in the antisymmetric supermode of a two laser array and the ampliﬁed sponta-

V. CONCLUSIONS

12

neous emission in the non-lasing symmetric supermode can give rise to relaxation oscillations
which phase-lock the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission to the laser light. In the limit of high
laser intensities, this eﬀect splits the spectrum into a center line at the laser frequency
and two sidebands. The center line represents the out-of-phase component of the ampli-
ﬁed spontaneous emission which does not interfere with the laser light. The two sidebands
correspond to the relaxation oscillations between the in-phase component of ampliﬁed spon-
taneous emission and the depth of spatial holeburning in the carrier distribution.

The sidebands may become undamped by the linewidth enhancement factor α, which
describes the conversion of laser light from the antisymmetric mode to the symmetric mode.
This eﬀect can be countered by carrier diﬀusion, which dampens the sidebands and may
actually suppress them. Depending on the device parameters, it is therefore possible to
alternatively ﬁnd in the spectrum only the sidebands, only a single center line, or the full
triplet. The continuous transition from a single line at the frequency of the symmetric
supermode to any of the three possibilities can be described analytically using equation
(19).

In all cases, the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission in the non-lasing supermode is strongly
modiﬁed by the spatial holeburning eﬀects. The spectra of the non-lasing modes above laser
threshold are therefore quite diﬀerent from the spectra at or below threshold described by
linear optics. It should be possible to observe such spectra experimentally by measuring the
spectrum of anti-phase locked laser arrays in the center of the farﬁeld, where contributions
from the anti-symmetric laser mode is close to zero. The type of spectrum observed will then
allow a determination of the coupling strength and the type of coupling in the respective
device.

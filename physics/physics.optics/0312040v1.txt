It is shown that three-dimensional nonparaxial beams are described by the

oblate spheroidal exact solutions of the Helmholtz equation. For the ﬁrst time,

their beam behaviour is investigated and their corresponding parameters are

deﬁned. Using the fact that the beam width of the family of paraxial Gaussian

beams is described by an hyperbola, the connection between the physical

parameters of nonparaxial spheroidal beam solutions and those of paraxial

beams is formally stablished. These results are also helpful to investigate the

exact vector nonparaxial beams.

Recent developments in science and technology brings the necessity of revisiting

the theory and concepts of nonparaxiality of optical beams. Its understanding has

great relevance in the description of optical ﬁelds which are tightly focused or, optical

beams whose diameter can be of the order of a few wavelengths as can be the case in

optical nanolasers.

When studying beams beyond the paraxial approximation, the standard ap-

proach, introduced by Lax, has been to start with the paraxial solution and then

to include some corrections.1, 2, 3, 4 Rigurously speaking, nonparaxial beams are solu-

tions of the wave equation without the paraxial approximation, in other words, they

are solutions of the Helmholtz wave equation

2E + k2E = 0, with k the wave num-

ber. Thus, such kind of solutions must be investigated in order to describe nonparaxial

beams.

A class of nonparaxial solutions has been introduced assuming a point source

located at a complex position along the z

axis. The spherical wave ﬁeld from this

virtual complex source is converted into a directional wave ﬁeld which remains a

rigurous solution of the Helmholtz equation.5 This virtual source mode has wave-

fronts that are approximately oblate spheroidal.6 This fact has also been discussed by

several authors and even have expressed the virtual source mode wave in spheroidal

coordinates.7, 8, 9, 10 Whatever the coordinate system used, the ﬁeld expression reduces,

under the paraxial approximation, to Gaussian beam.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

The virtual complex source point solutions carry an inherent singularity which

makes them inadequate to describe propagating ﬁelds near the origin or focal source

point.6, 8 To elliminate this problem a non-singular superposition of incoming and

∇

−

outgoing spherical waves has been used,6, 8 however even this non-singular solution

has problems since, to realise them physically, inﬁnite energy is required.12

In this letter we investigate the solutions of the scalar Helmholtz equation in

oblate spheroidal coordinates and we show that they can have a beam behaviour.

By identifying that the evolution of the beam width of a Gaussian mode follows an

hyperbola we relate the physical parameters of nonparaxial spheroidal beam solutions

and those of paraxial beams. This also allows to deﬁne quantitatively a threshold

between nonparaxial and paraxial beams. In the paraxial limit the oblate spheroidal

solution tend to Laguerre-Gaussian beams.

Pure plane, spherical or cylindrical waves of the Helmholz equation, cannot be

used, in a strict sense, to describe optical beams if we understand as such those ﬁeld

distributions that are concentrated around an imaginary line that will be identiﬁed

as the beam propagation axis. Here we show that solutions of the Helmholtz equation

in spheroidal coordinates can satisfy this requirement depending on the value of the

ellipsoidal parameter (to be deﬁned below).

The propagation axis will be the z

axis that will also be the azimuthal axis of the

oblate spheroid coordinate system. This coordinates are deﬁned by x = d(ξ2+1)1/2(1

where in the spheroidal radial functions R(p)

mn (ξ; c), the superindex p deﬁnes the kind

of solution (ﬁrst kind p = 1, second kind p = 2 and so on). With p = 3, 4 the solutions

are linear combinations of the ﬁrst two, namely R(3,4)

what we will use as they, can be used to describe travelling waves. There are two

spheroidal angular solutions S(1,2)

mn (η; c) but, we exclude the second one since it tends

to inﬁnity as it approaches the z-axis then, only that of ﬁrst kind can describe beams

of ﬁnite energy and so we drop the superindex for this solution.

In order to understand the physics of Eq. (2) we refer to Fig. 1 where the intensity

of the modes with m = n = 0 and m = n = 1 are shown. One immediately realises

that for c

= 0, the waveﬁeld distribution is concentrated around the z

axis, in other

−

words, it behaves like a beam. The angular part of (2) determines the transverse

pattern of the waveﬁeld while the radial part deﬁnes the propagation features. The

azimuthal and radial parts of the solution determine the form of the propagating

phase front, when m = 0 they are oblate spheroidal, Fig 1a), and when m

= 0 the

solution describes waveﬁelds with rotating wavefronts, Fig 1b).

To relate spheroidal solutions, Eq. (2) with those of the paraxial wave equation

analyse the geometry of paraxial beams. Their beam width w(z) is given by w2(z) =

w2

0(1+z2/R2

0) where w0 is the beam waist and R0 is the Rayleigh distance.15 Rewriting

this expression we get the hyperbola equation w2(z)/w2

z2/R2

0 = 1 to which we

can associate an oblate spheroidal coordinate system, this is shown in Fig. 2. In it,

d is the distance to one of the foci and w0 is the vertex of the hyperbola. From the

geometry of the hyperbola, the equation

(4)

has to be fulﬁlled. From the equation of the hyperbola, the angle of the asymptote

or far ﬁeld angle is tan α = w0/R0, this assigns a geometric place to R0 in Fig. 2.

We now make the connection between paraxial and spheroidal beams through the

common parameter d. Sustituting c = kd and R0 = kw2

0/2 in Eq. (3), after some

algebra, we get

This equation is the link that connects oblate spheroidal beams and paraxial beams.

There must exist a range of values of c for which oblate spheroidal beams describe

paraxial beams. This can be obtained, expressing this parameter in terms of the far

ﬁeld angle c = 2/(tan α sin α), since paraxial beams cannot diverge at cone angles

limit and compare them with the corresponding paraxial beam. Also, for reference,

it is plotted the normalised axial intensity for a highly nonparaxial beam with c < cp

(inner thin line). The small diﬀerences can be attributed to that the paraxial Laguerre-

Gauss beam is in the limit of its validity. In fact, for c > cp the behaviour of the oblate

spheroidal beams is even closer to paraxial beams. We have evaluated the waveﬁeld

proﬁles for large values of c > cp and found that the transverse part of the spheroidal

beams described by the angular solutions Smn (η; c) tend to the Laguerre-Gauss beam,

as expected.13 This similarity occurs earlier for the zero-order mode for c just above

cp. Finally, notice that from Eq. (4) when c

the radial functions R(3,4)

mn tend to

plane waves for the fundamental order mode and when c

0, the nonparaxial oblate

spheroidal beams tend to resemble spherical waves.

That the solutions discussed here are diﬀerent from those obtained with the

complex source point method (CSPM) expressed in spheroidal coordinates.7, 8, 9, 10 The

zero-order nonparaxial beams obtained with the CSPM have a singularity inherited

from its construction from a source point.12 The oblate spheroidal beams presented

here do not present any singularity whenever c

= 0. Using the CSPM,7, 8, 9, 10 it is

usually proposed that in the paraxial limit d can take the value of R0. From eq. (3)

it is clear that this situation can never be possible since it would imply a physical

inconsistency, w0 = 0 and a far-ﬁeld angle α = 0 (see Fig. 2).

In conlcusion, for the ﬁrst time, we have demonstrated that spheroidal beams

describe paraxial and nonparaxial beam exact solutions of the Helmholtz equation.

We have established a threshold that separates nonparaxial and paraxial regimes.

Higher oblate spheroidal modes reduce in a natural way to Laguerre-Gauss beams

when the spheroidal parameter c exceeds the critical value cp. The results presented

here were in the neighborhood of the paraxial limit and thus the scalar treatment is

valid. Our approach extends straightforward to vector nonparaxial beams in Eq. (2),

to obtain the corresponding vectorial components obtained.16 Thorough investigations

Abstract

A numerical study of the properties of Gaussian pulses propagating in
planar waveguide under the combined eﬀect of positive Kerr-type nonlinear-
ity, diﬀraction in planar waveguides and anomalous or normal dispersion, is
presented.
It is demonstrated how the relative strength of dispersion and
diﬀraction, the strength of nonlinearity and the initial spatial and temporal
pulse chirps eﬀect on the parameters of pulse compression, such as the maxi-
mal compression factor and the distance to the point of maximal compression.

1 Introduction

A compression of optical pulses in Kerr-type nonlinear media have been subject
to investigation for many years and continues to attract a certain attention [1, 2].
In single-mode ﬁbers with anomalous group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and positive
nonlinearity the pulse compression is based on the mechanism of higher-order soliton
generation [3]. In single-mode ﬁbers with normal GVD the pulse compression can
be obtained in the conﬁguration with a grating pair [4, 5]. In both cases the self-
phase modulation (SPM) induced by an intense pulse is used. However, the intense
pump pulse propagating together with a weak probe pulse can also cause pulse
compression by the mechanisms of the so-called cross-phase modulation (XPM) [6],
or the induced-phase modulation (IPM) [7].

A possibility of pulse compression in non-dispersive nonlinear bulk media due to
another nonlinear eﬀect, that of self-focusing, is discussed in [8]-[10] with the aid of
the paraxial ray approximation, [8, 10], and by means of the variational analysis,
[9]. Still another pulse compression technique that uses the self conﬁnement of
two-dimensional spatial bright solitons propagating in non-dispersive bulk media is
mentioned in [11], where the two-beam interference technique is used in order to
ensure that a ﬁlamentation (a splitting of the beam into many sub-beams) does not
occur.

Moreover, a simultaneous space-time collapse, which can occur in bulk media
and in planar waveguides under the combined eﬀect of nonlinearity, diﬀraction and
anomalous dispersion, may also be useful for pulse compression [12, 13]. This kind
of collapse gives rise to short pulses with extremely high optical ﬁeld [14, 15, 16]. It
is realizable both in the case when dispersion and diﬀraction have comparable eﬀect
on pulse propagation and in the more general case when one of the eﬀects above is
dominating (see [17]).

On the other side, the interplay of normal dispersion and positive nonlinearity
causes quite diﬀerent behavior of the pulse. In optical ﬁbers where diﬀraction terms
are not included it leads to a monotonic pulse spreading. However, the inclusion of
the diﬀraction term, which is necessary for a planar waveguide, can lead to a pulse
compression, as it was described in [17, 18]. Besides, in planar waveguide, normal
dispersion slows the self-focusing of the pulse and causes a splitting of the pulse into
two pulses [18, 19]. The eﬀect of splitting of a pulse was observed also in the bulk
media [12].

In this paper a compression of a pulse propagating in planar, self-focusing nonlin-
ear planar waveguide in the regime of anomalous and normal dispersion is considered.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion describing dispersive pulse propagation in nonlinear planar waveguides and the
parameters of pulse compression are introduced. In Section 3, an estimation of the

2

condition of pulse collapse is made with the aid of the so-called method of moments
[20]. Numerical results describing the inﬂuence of the magnitude of nonlinearity, the
relative strength of dispersion and diﬀraction and the spatial and temporal chirp of
the initial Gaussian pulse on the pulse compression parameters are discussed in
Section 4.

2 Basic equations

It is well known that starting from the Maxwell equations for the envelope U(x, y, z, t)
of the electric ﬁeld

E(x, y, z, t) = U(x, y, z, t)e−i(ωt−n0β0z)

propagating along the z axis in a planar waveguide with positive, instantaneous Kerr-
type nonlinearity, one obtains the 2-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation

Solution of NSE (Equation 1) with the initial condition given by Equation 2 can
describe a propagation of a dispersive Gaussian pulse in nonlinear planar waveguides.
It is worth remarking that for the anomalous dispersion regime a solutions of this
equation can also describe a dispersion-less elliptic Gaussian beam, [24, 25] (i.e. a
cw beam with elliptic Gaussian transverse proﬁle) propagating in a nonlinear bulk
media.

In this paper we refer to the case of σ =

spatiotemporal pulse; the case of σ

−

In the particular case of the cylindrical spatiotemporal pulse a simple analytic
solution of the NSE exists which describes a behavior of beam propagating in non-
linear media by means of the variational approximation [14] or by means of the
scaled complex rays formulation within the so-called ABCD matrix formalism (see
[26, 27]). For the asymmetric spatiotemporal pulse only a semi-analytical approach
of [24, 25] is known in the literature.

It is known that some solutions of the two- or three-dimensional NSE can de-
velop into a singularity of the electric ﬁeld when the initial pulse power exceeds a
certain critical value [14]. This phenomenon, known as a pulse collapse, can occur
simultaneously in space and time for a pulse propagating in planar waveguide with
the anomalous GVD [14, 15], and also for a dispersion-less beam propagating in
self-focusing bulk medium. This singularity, however, is obviously non-physical, for
it emerges just as an artifact of the paraxial approximation made when deriving
the NSE. In order to avoid this limitation, either a non-paraxial treatment of the
process of self-focusing [28] or some other eﬀects, such as the nonlinear absorption
and the saturation of the nonlinear refractive index, should be taken into considera-
tion. From another hand, the appearance of a non-physical singularity in numerical
simulations based on NSE can serve as an indication to the real collapse taking place
in the certain point of space. This is in fact the criterion used in Section 4.

Studying the details of developing the pulse collapse we leave beyond the scope
of this paper. Instead, our task is to determine the values of the parameters σ and

4

N 2 for which the pulse collapse can occur. For this purpose the so-called method of
moments [29] could be used. However, it gives only an estimation of the suﬃcient
conditions of the pulse collapse, whereas the latter can occur, in fact, at the earlier
times or on the shorter propagation distances [10]. More precise conditions will be
obtained by means of the numerical simulations presented in Section 3, (cf. also
[14])

The method of moments originates from the paper of Vlasov e.a.
used as an approach to the determination of whether a given initial wave pulse can
collapse to a singular point in a ﬁnite period of time [30]. An application of the
method of moments to the NSE may be found in [20].

In order to formulate the condition of collapse in terms of the strength of non-
linearity, N 2, and the relative strength of dispersion and diﬀraction, σ, we ﬁrst

when the self-focusing caused by the nonlinearity dominates over the broadening of
a pulse, which is due to the diﬀraction and dispersion. It is obvious that for smaller

4 Numerical results and discussion

×

In this Section, the results of numerical solution of the 2+1 dimensional NSE by
means of the well-known Split-Step Spectral Method (SSSM) [31] with the two
dimensional (2d) Fast Fourier Transform [32] are presented. The calculations on
512 points (transverse steps, ∆ξ = ∆τ = 0.08)
the two-dimensional grid with 512
and with the longitudinal step depending on the nonlinearity so that for N 2 = 1,
∆ζ = 0.01, were performed. Because of the lack of spatial-temporal cylindrical
symmetry of the problem it is not possible to simplify calculations by reducing the
2d Fast Fourier Transform to the one dimensional Hankel Transform developed in
[33, 34]. Several checks of our numerical procedure were made, which include a
simulation of beam propagation in the absence of group-velocity dispersion (σ = 0),
repeated testing with diﬀerent transverse grid and longitudinal step length, and the
monitoring of pulse energy during each simulation. The latter was kept constant
with an error < 0.00005

As initial conditions in numerical calculations we take Gaussian pulse given by
Equation 2. First, for the case of anomalous dispersion regime we will compare
conditions of pulse collapse predicted by method of moments with those obtained
from numerical calculations. Further, with the aid of numerical calculations we will
study inﬂuence of the strength of nonlinearity, relative strength of dispersion and
diﬀraction and spatial and temporal pulse chirps on pulse compression parameters.
Above analysis will be perform both for anomalous as well as normal dispersion
regime.

4.1 The anomalous dispersion regime

In this section the inﬂuence of the parameters σ and N 2 on the pulse collapse and
compression will be considered.

In Fig. 1, a comparison of the conditions of the collapse of pulse predicted by
the method of moments with those obtained by numerical calculations is presented.
In our numerical procedure the occurrence of pulse collapse was identiﬁed with the
eiφ,
discontinuity of the phase φ(0, 0, ζ)) in the central point of the pulse u =
and with a non-monotonic behavior of the intensity in the central point of the pulse
after reaching the collapse point. The results of numerical simulation are plotted by
two kinds of points corresponding to the cases when, respectively, the pulse collapse
occurs or does not occur. The prediction of the method of moments is given by the
straight line N 2 = 1
σ, (see Equation 5). The boundary line between the collapse
and the no collapse regions, obtained from the numerical data is approximately
described by N 2
It is parallel to the straight line predicted by the
method of moments, unless the absolute value of σ is too small.

Therefore, for both methods, the magnitude of the parameter N 2 which is suf-
ﬁcient for the pulse collapse to occur increase linearly with
. The discrepancy
appears due to the theoretical idealization of the picture of the collapse where all
the energy of the pulse goes to the singularity point. This also explains why condi-
tions of numerical collapse are typically softer than those predicted by the method
of moments described in Section 3.

Studying details of pulse collapse we leave beyond task of this paper. Instead,
we will study the inﬂuence of the relative strength of dispersion and diﬀraction,
the nonlinearity and the spatial and temporal chirps on the parameters of pulse
compression under the condition that the pulse collapse does not occur.

Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 represent the results of calculations of the inﬂuence of the
relative strength of dispersion and diﬀraction, σ, on the maximal compression factor,
cmax, and on the position of the minimal pulse width, ζm, for diﬀerent values of the
strength of nonlinearity, N 2 and for Gaussian initial pulse with ﬂat phase front.
As it could be expected the parameters of pulse compression, cmax and ζm,increase
monotonically with the increase of N 2 and the decrease of σ until collapse conditions
are reached. This behavior is obvious from the fact that increase of N 2 cause increase
of pulse self-focusing, it helps to concentrate pulse energy in the center, in addition,
decrease of σ cause decrease of dispersion broadening of the pulse.

In Fig. 4 the results of numerical simulations of the inﬂuence of the initial spatial,
C, chirps on the pulse compression
Cξ = C, and two cases of temporal, Cτ =
parameters are presented. In order to distinguish between the above two cases we
introduce a parameter

±

S = sgn(

CξCτ σ),

−
which equals 1 for the case of focusing (defocusing) temporal and spatial chirps and
equals -1 for the case of focusing (defocusing) temporal and defocusing (focusing)
spatial chirps.

As it could be expected, the focusing spatial and temporal chirps, C < 0, S = 1,
cause the increase of the pulse compression parameters. The explanation is that
a defocusing chirp spreads the energy out from the center of the pulse, whereas a
focusing chirp concentrates it there. As the result, the nonlinearity-induced phase
curvature of the ﬁeld is, respectively, reduced or enhanced. Similar eﬀect of the
focusing chirp of the initial pulse takes place in the region close to the collapse.
Namely, the focusing spatial chirp can hasten the collapse, whereas a defocusing
chirp can either delay or eliminate it entirely [17].
1 (i.e.

the spatial focusing chirp and
the temporal defocusing chirp occur simultaneously). The increase of the maximal
compression factor occurs only for the case of focusing temporal chirp, C > 0,
whereas this is not always true for a spatial focusing chirp C < 0, see Fig. 4.
One can conclude that the temporal chirp has larger eﬀect on the temporal pulse

More interesting is the case of S =

−

8

compression than he spatial one. One can expect the reverse situation in the case
of spatial compression of the pulse.

4.2 Normal dispersion regime

In the case of normal dispersion regime the collapse of the pulse doesn’t occur.
However, due to the the spatiotemporal coupling occurring in nonlinear medium
when both the diﬀraction and the dispersion eﬀects take place a pulse compression
can be obtained [18].

In this section we will study the inﬂuence of the relative strength of dispersion
and diﬀraction, the nonlinearity and the spatial and temporal pulse chirps on the
parameters of pulse compression.

It is seen from Fig. 5 that the maximal compression factor, cmax, monotoni-
cally decreases with σ, and increases with N 2. It is clear because smaller value of
the parameter σ has a weaker inﬂuence on the dispersion broadening of the pulse,
moreover the increase of N 2 leads to the increase of the spatiotemporal coupling
and nonlinearity induced phase curvature of the ﬁeld. In the end both eﬀects lead
to the temporal compression of the pulse.

From Fig. 6 it is seen that for suﬃciently small values of σ the parameter ζm
decreases with N 2. However it appears to be practically independent on σ once a
certain threshold level of N 2 is reached. This fact was explained in [17] by means of
the periodic beam narrowing of higher-order spatial solitons. A diﬀerent behavior
takes place at larger values of sigma (σ > 0.25). Namely, at ﬁrst ζm increases with
N 2 for suﬃciently small N 2 and then it slowly decreases after reaching a maximal
value at the certain value of N 2. This behavior is explainable by the fact that at
small nonlinearities the eﬀects of dispersion prevent a creation of spatial solitons.

In Fig. 7 the results of numerical calculations of the inﬂuence of the initial pulse
chirp on the parameters of pulse compression cm and ζm are presented. The focusing
spatial and temporal chirps, C < 0, S = 1, cause the increase of the compression
parameters (cmax ans ζmax) and this behavior appears to be similar to that which we
have previously observed in Fig. 4 for the anomalous dispersion regime. However,
in the case of the anomalous GVD cmax grows with C much faster that in the case of
normal GVD. Namely, for the anomalous GVD the maximal compression factor for
a chirped initial pulse with C =
2 is three times larger than that for an initial pulse
cmax(C = 0). For the normal
with ﬂat phase front (C = 0, i.e. cmax(C =
GVD the increase of the cmax is rather slow, e.g. cmax(C =
cmax(C = 0),
and a saturation of the maximal compression factor occurs for the initial chirps below

2 (see Fig. 7).

Moreover, for the case of C < 0, S =

1 (i.e. the spatial focusing chirp and
the temporal defocusing chirp) the maximal compression factor increases only for

focusing temporal chirp, whereas this is not always true for a spatial focusing chirp
Cξ < 0.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, the physical conditions of collapse and compression of dispersive
Gaussian pulses propagating in waveguide with the positive Kerr-type nonlinearity,
diﬀraction and the anomalous or normal dispersion are investigated.

We determine the values of the relative strength of dispersion and diﬀraction,
σ, and the strength of nonlinearity, N 2, for which the pulse collapse can occur. For
this purpose we ﬁrst present an estimation given by the method of moments [29].
More precise conditions are obtained by means of the numerical simulations based
on the (2+1)-dimensional Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation (see Section 4).

We characterize a pulse compression by two parameters: the maximal compres-
sion factor, cmax, and the distance to the point of the maximal compression, ζm, (see
Section 2). By means of a numerical simulation we study how these two parame-
ters depend on the parameters N 2 and σ, and the initial spatial and temporal pulse
chirps. We demonstrate that in the regime of both anomalous and normal dispersion
the increase of the nonlinearity and the decrease of the relative strength of dispersion
and diﬀraction cause the increase of the maximal compression factor. Moreover, in
the case of anomalous dispersion regime the compression factor is maximal in the
region of 1

N 2.

Furthermore, we observe that the increase of the focusing temporal and spatial
chirps of the initial pulse lead to the increase of the maximal compression factor,
cmax.
In the case of the anomalous GVD cmax grows with chirp, C, much faster
that in the case of normal GVD, for which a saturation of the maximal compression
factor occurs.

Moreover, the increase of the focusing temporal chirp might lead, even in the
presence of the defocusing spatial chirp, to the increase of the maximal compression
factor, cmax, whereas the defocusing temporal chirp always leads to the decrease of
cmax, even in the case of the focusing spatial chirp. It may be concluded, therefore,
that the temporal chirp has larger eﬀect on the maximal pulse compression factor
than the spatial chirp. In reverse, it is expected that the spatial focusing chirp has
larger impact on the beam with than the temporal chirp, independently on its sign.

Figure 1: Comparison of the suﬃcient conditions for pulse collapse predicted by the
method of moments (straight line) and numerical calculations (ﬁlled circle points
denote pulse collapse and empty circle points indicate no collapse). It was done for
initial Gaussian pulse with ﬂat phase front, propagating in a medium described by
two parameters: the strength of the nonlinearity, N 2 and the relative strength of
dispersion and diﬀraction, σ.

of dispersion and diﬀraction, σ < 0, for diﬀerent value of the strength of nonlinearity,
N 2, and for initial Gaussian pulse with ﬂat phase front.

We study the second-harmonic generation in left-handed metamaterials with a quadratic non-
linear response. We demonstrate a novel type of the exact phase matching between the backward
propagating wave of the fundamental frequency and the forward propagating wave of the second
harmonics. We show that this novel parametric process can convert a surface of the left-handed
metamaterial into an eﬀective mirror totally reﬂecting the second harmonics generated by an incident
wave. We derive and analyze theoretically the coupled-mode equations for a semi-inﬁnite nonlinear
metamaterial. We also study numerically the second-harmonic generation by a metamaterial slab
of a ﬁnite thickness, and reveal the existence of multistable nonlinear eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

the cubic nonlinearity or its diﬀerent generalizations.

Recent years demonstrated many advances in the de-
sign and engineering of artiﬁcial composite structures
with unique electromagnetic response, which have broad-
ened signiﬁcantly the range of possible wave phenomena

that the composite metallic periodic structures may al-
low realizing hypothetical and surprising materials, ﬁrst
predicted theoretically and termed left-handed media [1],
which possess simultaneously negative dielectric permit-
tivity and magnetic permeability. Indeed, the composite
metallic structures consisting of arrays of wires and split-
ring-resonators have been demonstrated to possess left-
handed properties in the microwave frequency range [2].
These composite materials received a great deal of inter-
est due to their highly nontrivial and quite often counter-
intuitive electromagnetic properties. In particular, such
materials support backward waves, and they exhibit neg-
ative refraction at interfaces [3].

The study of linear wave propagation and linear prop-
erties of left-handed materials is a major subject of re-
search in this ﬁeld. It is indeed the case when both mag-
netic permeability and dielectric permittivity of the ma-
terial do not depend on the intensity of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld. However, the future eﬀorts creating tunable
structures where the ﬁeld intensity changes the transmis-
sion properties of the composite structure would require
the knowledge of nonlinear properties of such metama-
terials, which may be quite unusual.
Indeed, inserting
small conducting elements into a periodic metallic struc-
ture of the metamaterial brings an unique opportunity
to enhance nonlinear response in such left-handed media
because the microscopic electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the
structure resonant elements can become much stronger
than an average macroscopic ﬁeld. Indeed, it has already
been shown analytically and numerically that the com-
posite material containing nonlinear elements in the slits
of split-ring resonators possesses a hysteresis-type nonlin-
ear magnetic response [4, 5]. This is an example of self-
action of electromagnetic waves usually associated with

Inclusion the elements with non-symmetric current-
voltage characteristics such as diodes into the split-ring
resonators will result in a quadratic nonlinear response of
the metamaterial [6]. This quadratic nonlinearity is re-
sponsible for the recently analyzed parametric processes
such as the second-harmonic generation (SHG) [7] and
three-wave mixing [8]. In particular, the ﬁrst analysis of
SHG from a semi-inﬁnite left-handed medium has been
brieﬂy presented by Agranovich et al. [7], who employed
the nonlinear optics approach and also made a state-
ment that for metamaterials “... SHG in transmission
is badly phase-mismatched” parametric process, and “it
is then the SHG in reﬂection that is more interesting”.
(see Ref. [7], p. 165112-5).

In this paper we consider the problem of SHG during
the scattering from a semi-inﬁnite left-handed medium
(or a slab of the left-handed material of a ﬁnite extent)
and demonstrate that the original paper by Agranovich
et al. [7] missed an important additional phase-matching
condition, quite speciﬁc for the harmonic generation by
the backward waves. With this condition, we demon-
strate that exact phase matching between a backward
propagating wave of the fundamental frequency (FF) and
the forward propagating wave at the second harmonics
(SH) is indeed possible. This novel phase matched pro-
cess allows for creating an eﬀective “quadratic mirror”
that reﬂects the SH component generated by an incident
FF wave.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we describe
our model including both the electric and magnetic re-
sponses. Quadratic nonlinearity and the SHG process in
metamaterials are discussed in Sec. 3.
In Sec. 4, we
develop the corresponding coupled-mode theory for SHG
with backward waves and present the analysis of both
lossy and lossless cases of this model. Section 5 is devoted
to the case of SHG process a slab of ﬁnite-extension. At
last, Sec. 6 concludes the paper.

II. MODEL

We consider a three-dimensional composite structure
consisting of a cubic lattice of conducting wires and split-
ring resonators (SRR), shown schematically in the insert
of Fig. 1. We assume that the unit-cell size of the struc-
ture d is much smaller then the wavelength of the propa-
gating electromagnetic ﬁeld and, for simplicity, we choose
a single-ring geometry of the lattice of SRRs. The results
obtained for this case are qualitatively similar to those
obtained in more involved cases of double SRRs. This
type of microstructured medium is known to possess the
basic properties of left-handed metamaterials exhibiting
negative refraction in the microwave region.

In the eﬀective-medium approximation, a response of
this composite metallic structure can be described by av-
eraged equations allowing to introduce the eﬀective di-
electric permittivity and eﬀective magnetic permeability
of the form

where ωp is the eﬀective plasma frequency, ω0 is a reso-
nant frequency of the array of SRRs, F is the form-factor
of the lattice, and ω is the angular frequency of the elec-
tromagnetic waves. The product of permittivity ǫ and
permeability µ deﬁnes the square of the eﬀective refrac-
tive index, n2 = ǫµ, and its sign determines if waves can
(n2 > 0) or cannot (n2 < 0) propagate in the medium.
Due to the medium dispersion deﬁned by the dependen-
cies (1) and (2), the wave propagation becomes possible
only in certain frequency domains while the waves de-
cay for other frequencies. Metamaterial possesses left-
handed properties when both ǫ and µ become simultane-
ously negative, and such a frequency domain exists in the
model described by Eqs. (1) and (2) provided ωp > ω0.
In this case, the metamaterial is left-handed within the
frequency range

where ωp is the plasma frequency introduced in Eq. (1).
We assume that ωM < ωp, and in this case we have
two frequency ranges where the material is transparent,
the range where the material is left-handed (LHM), and
the right-handed (RHM) domain for ω > ωp, where both
permittivity and permeability are positive (shaded do-
mains in Fig. 1). For the frequencies outside these two
domains, the composite material is opaque.

additional diodes are inserted into the SRRs of the struc-
ture [6], as shown schematically in the insert of Fig. 1.
Quadratic nonlinearity is known to be responsible for var-
ious parametric processes in nonlinear media, including
the frequency doubling and generation of the second-
harmonic ﬁeld.
In dispersive materials, and especially
in the metamaterials with the frequency domains with
diﬀerent wave properties, the SHG process can be rather
nontrivial because the wave at the fundamental frequency
and the second harmonics can fall into diﬀerent domains
of the material properties.

The most unusual harmonic generation and other para-
metric processes are expected when one of the waves (ei-
ther FF or SH wave) has the frequency for which the
metamaterial becomes left-handed. The speciﬁc interest
to this kind of parametric processes is due to the fact that
the waves in the left-handed media are backward, i.e. the
energy propagates in the direction opposite to that of the
wave vector. Both phase-matching condition and nonlin-
ear interaction of the forward and backward waves may
become quite nontrivial, as is known from the physics

interested in this type of parametric wave interactions.

In nonlinear quadratic composite metamaterials, in-
teraction of the forward and backward waves of diﬀerent
harmonics takes place when the material is left-handed
either for the frequency ω or the double frequency 2ω.
Under this condition, there exist two types of the most
interesting SHG parametric processes in metamaterials.
Case I. The frequency of the FF wave is in the range
ω0/2 < ω < ωM /2 and, therefore, the SH wave is gen-
erated with the double frequency in the LHM domain
(see Fig. 1). For such parameters, the electromagnetic
waves at the FF frequency are non-propagating, since

ǫ(ω)µ(ω) < 0. As a result, the ﬁeld with the frequency
ω from this range incident on a semi-inﬁnite left-handed
medium will decay exponentially from the surface inside
the metamaterial. Taking into account Eqs. (1) and (2),
the depth δ of this skin-layer can be found as

where kk is the tangential component of the wavevector
of the incident wave, and λ is a free space wavelength.
For the SH wave generated in this layer, the metama-
terial becomes transparent. In this case, a thin slab of
a metamaterial may operate as a nonlinear left-handed
lens that will provide an image of the source at the sec-
ond harmonics, as suggested recently in Ref. [10]. This
case has also been mentioned in the earlier paper on the
second-harmonic generation [7].

Case II. The FF wave is left-handed, whereas the SH
wave is right-handed. Such a process is possible when
ωp < 2ω0 (see Fig. 1). What is truly remarkable here
is the possibility of exact phase-matching of the SHG
parametric process, in addition to the cases discussed
earlier in Ref. [7]. The phase-matching conditions for this
parametric process are depicted in the dispersion diagram
of Fig. 2 for the propagating waves in the metamaterial
where the dispersion of the plane waves is deﬁned by the
relation

ǫ(ω)µ(ω)

The exact phase matching takes place when 2k(ω) =
k(2ω). Diﬀerent signs of the slopes of the curves at the
frequencies ω and 2ω indicate that one of the waves is
forward, while the other wave is backward.

and SRRs. To generate a nonlinear quadratic response
of the metamaterial, we assume that each SRR contains
a diode, as depicted schematically in the inset of Fig. 1.
The diode is described by the current-voltage depen-
dence,

I =

where Uc and Rd are the parameters of the diode, and
U is the voltage on the diode. Equation (6) is valid pro-
Uc, and it represents two terms of the Tay-
vided U
lor expansion series of the realistic (and more complex)
current-voltage characteristics of the diode.

≪

Following the standard procedure, we consider two
components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld at the fundamen-
tal frequency ω and its second harmonics 2ω, assuming
that all other components are not phase matched and
therefore they give no substantial contribution into the
nonlinear parametric interaction. Subsequently, we write
the general coupled-mode equations describing the simul-
taneous propagation of two harmonics in the dispersive
metamaterial as follows,

and the period of the metamaterial, respectively, and γ
is the damping coeﬃcient of the SRR. For simplicity, we
assume that both FF and SH waves are of the same polar-
ization, and therefore they can be described by only one
component of the magnetic ﬁeld. In this case, Eqs. (7)
become scalar. In the derivation of Eqs. (7) we take into
account the Lorentz-Lorenz relation between the micro-
scopic and macroscopic magnetic ﬁelds [11]. Also, it is
assumed that the diode resistance Rd is much larger than
1/ωC, so that
the impedance of the SRR slit, i.e. Rd ≫
the resonant properties of the composite are preserved.

IV. SEMI-INFINITE METAMATERIAL

First, we consider a semi-inﬁnite left-handed medium
and the SHG process for the wave scattering at the sur-
face. We assume that a TM-polarized FF wave is incident
on a LH material from the vacuum, as shown schemat-

the fundamental frequency satisﬁes the dispersion rela-
tion (5) which deﬁnes the wavenumber k. As is discussed
above, the FF wave in the left-handed medium is back-
ward, meaning that the normal component of the wave
vector is directed towards the surface, i.e. in the direction
opposite to the Poynting vector.

When the phase-matching conditions are satisﬁed, the
generated SH wave has the wavevector parallel to that of
the FF wave (see Fig. 3). However, the SH wave is for-
ward propagating, so that the energy at this frequency
should propagate towards the interface. When losses are
negligible, the FF wave will be transformed completely
into the SH wave with the energy ﬂows in the direction
opposite to that of the FF wave. This kind of the SHG
process in a semi-inﬁnite left-handed medium is charac-
terized by two major features: (i) the eﬃciency of the
SHG process may become very high, and (ii) the SH wave
propagates in the direction opposite to that of the incom-
ing FF wave.

A. Coupled-mode equations

To describe the SHG process analytically, we employ
the coupled-mode theory and the slowly-varying envelope
approximation for the FF and SH ﬁelds, and present the
magnetic ﬁelds in the material in the form:
H1,2(t, z) = a1,2(t, z)eik1,2z + c.c.,

(9)

where the amplitudes of the FF and SH ﬁelds a1,2(t, z)
are assumed to vary slow in both space and time, i.e.
∂a1,2/∂t
ka1,2. Substituting
Eqs. (9) into Eqs. (7) and neglecting the second-order
derivatives, we obtain the coupled equations,

The incoming FF backward travelling wave has the
group velocity in the z-direction, and the phase velocity
– in the opposite direction. The generated SH forward
wave has both the phase and group velocities in the
z-
direction. The FF wave propagates inside the material,
and it loses the energy due to SHG and also due to losses
in the medium. As a result, the SH amplitude decreases
in the z-direction, and the boundary conditions should
be taken in the form b1,2(

B. Lossless process

First, we neglect the metamaterial losses assuming, for
simplicity, that ν1,2 = 0 and Im(q1,2) = 0. At the large
enough value of the phase mismatch we can neglect the
derivatives in the second equation of the system (13), and
obtain a local coupling between the FF and SH ampli-
tudes,

Looking for stationary solutions of Eqs. (17), we take

it corresponds to an explosive instability of the paramet-
rically interacting waves. However, this singularity does
not appear in the corresponding boundary problem.

pled FF and SH ﬁelds, where the FF wave has a localized
proﬁle, while the SH wave has a tanh proﬁle,

that in the moving reference frame both waves should

arbitrary constants, β and T , so that the corresponding
family of solutions is two-parametric.

Next, we consider more realistic case with a linear
damping of the SH wave smaller than that of the FF
wave, since the FF wave is much closer to the resonance
where such losses may become quite essential. We as-
sume again Im(q1,2) = 0, so that the stationary solution
of Eqs. (13) can be found in this case analytically under
the conditions of the exact phase matching. First, we

slab, so that the reﬂected and transmitted waves of both
the frequencies ω and 2ω appear (see Fig. 4), with the
amplitudes H (t)

We have presented a comprehensive study of the spe-
ciﬁc features of the second-harmonic generation in left-
handed metamaterials with a quadratic nonlinear re-
sponse. First, we have demonstrated a possibility of the
exact phase matching between backward propagating FF
and forward propagating SH waves. Then, we have de-
veloped an analytical approach based on a novel type of
the coupled-mode equations in order to characterize the
process of the harmonic generation from a semi-inﬁnite
left-handed metamaterial. In particular, we have demon-
strated that a surface of the left-handed metamaterial
can operate as an eﬀective mirror that reﬂects all gen-
erated SH waves. Finally, we have performed numerical
simulations of the second-harmonic generation process
for a ﬁnite slab of the metamaterial, and revealed quite
unusual multi-valued multistable transmissions and re-
ﬂections.

We suggest a novel type of photonic structures where the strength of diﬀraction can be managed
in a very broad frequency range. We introduce optimized arrays of curved waveguides where light
beams experience wavelength-independent normal, anomalous, or zero diﬀraction. Our results sug-
gest novel opportunities for eﬃcient self-collimation, focusing, and reshaping of beams produced by
white-light and super-continuum sources. We also show how to manipulate light patterns through
multicolor Talbot eﬀect, which is possible neither in free space nor in conventional photonic lattices.

It is known that periodic photonic structures can be
employed to engineer and control the fundamental prop-
erties of light propagation [1, 2]. In particular, the beam
refraction and diﬀraction can be modiﬁed dramatically,
resulting in many unusual phenomena. For example,
a beam can experience negative refraction in the direc-
tion opposite to normal at the interface with a photonic
crystal [2, 3, 4, 5]. Additionally, the natural tendency
of beams to broaden during propagation can be con-
trolled through diﬀraction management [6]. Diﬀraction
can be eliminated in periodic structures leading to self-
collimation eﬀect where the average beam width does not
change over hundreds of free-space diﬀraction lengths [7].
On the other hand, diﬀraction can be made negative al-
lowing for focusing of diverging beams [8] and imaging of
objects with sub-wavelength resolution [9, 10].

The physics of periodic photonic structures is governed
by scattering of waves from modulations of the refractive
index and their subsequent interference. This is a res-
onant process, which is sensitive to both the frequency
and propagation angle. Strong dependence of the beam
refraction on the optical wavelength known as superprism
eﬀect was observed in photonic crystals [11]. Spatial
beam diﬀraction also depends on the wavelength, and
it was found in recent experiments [7, 12] that the ef-
fect of beam self-collimation is restricted to a spectral
range of less than 10% of the central frequency. Such a
strong dependence of the spatial beam dynamics on wave-
length can be used for multiplexing and demultiplexing
of signals in optical communication networks [13, 14].
However, it remains an open question whether photonic
structures can be used to perform spatial steering and
shaping of beams emitted by white-light sources, such as
light with supercontinuum frequency spectrum generated
in photonic-crystal ﬁbers and ﬁber tapers [15, 16].

In this Letter, we suggest a novel type of periodic
photonic structures designed for wavelength-independent
diﬀraction management in a very broad frequency range,
covering a spectral range up to 50% of the central fre-
quency. We introduce the optimized periodic struc-

tures where multicolor beams experience constant nor-
mal, anomalous, or zero diﬀraction. This opens up
novel opportunities for eﬃcient self-collimation, focus-
ing, and shaping of white-light beams. For example, in
such optimized structures it becomes possible to manipu-
late white-light patterns through multicolor Talbot eﬀect,
which otherwise is not feasible in free space or in conven-
tional photonic lattices.

We study propagation of beams emitted by a contin-
uous white-light source in a periodic array of coupled
optical waveguides [see Fig. 1(a)], where the waveguide
axes are also periodically curved in the propagation di-
rection [see examples in Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)]. In the linear
regime, the overall beam dynamics is deﬁned by indepen-
dent evolution of complex beam envelopes E(x, z; λ) at
individual frequency components governed by the nor-
malized paraxial equations,

ulated with the period d in the transverse direction, and
x0(z) ≡ x0(z + L) deﬁnes the longitudinal bending pro-
ﬁle of the waveguide axis with the period L ≫ d. When
the tilt of beams and waveguides at the input facet is
less than the Bragg angle at each wavelength, the beam
propagation is primarily characterized by coupling be-
tween the fundamental modes of the waveguides, and can
be described by the tight-binding equations taking into
account the periodic waveguide bending [12, 17],

First, we demonstrate

self-
collimation of white-light beams, where all the wavelength
components remain localized despite a nontrivial evolu-
tion in the photonic structure. Self-collimation regime
is realized when the diﬀraction is suppressed and the ef-
fective coupling coeﬃcient vanishes, Ceﬀ = 0. This ef-
fect was previously observed for monochromatic beams
in arrays with zigzag [6] or sinusoidal [12] bending pro-
ﬁles, however in such structures the condition of zero
coupling cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously with Eq. (4),
resulting in strong beam diﬀraction under frequency de-
tuning by several percent [12]. We ﬁnd that broad-
band diﬀraction management becomes possible in hy-
brid structures with a periodic bending proﬁle that con-
sists of alternating segments [see example in Fig. 2(a)],
x0(z) = A1{cos [2πz/z0] − 1} for 0 ≤ z ≤ z0, x0(z) =
A2{cos [2π(z − z0)/(L/2 − z0)] − 1} for z0 ≤ z ≤ L/2,
and x0(z) = −x0(z − L/2) for L/2 ≤ z ≤ L. Eﬀective
coupling in the hybrid structure can be calculated analyt-
ically, Ceﬀ (ω) = C(ω)2L−1[z0J0(ξ1) + (L/2 − z0)J0(ξ2)],
where Jm is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of the
order m, ξ1 = 2πA1ω/z0, and ξ2 = 2πA2ω/ (L/2 − z0).

We select a class of symmetric proﬁles of the waveg-
uide bending to avoid asymmetric beam distortion due to
higher-order eﬀects such as third-order diﬀraction. Ad-
ditionally, the waveguides are not tilted at the input, i.e.
˙x0(z = 0) = 0, in order to suppress excitation of higher-
order photonic bands by incident beams inclined by less
than the Bragg angle. The eﬀect of Zener tunneling to
higher bands [21, 22] and associated scattering losses can
be suppressed irrespective of the waveguide tilt inside the
photonic structure by selecting suﬃciently slow modula-
tion to minimize the curvature ¨x0(z) and thereby achieve
adiabatic beam shaping.

In order to realize broadband self-collimation, we
choose the structure parameters such that ξ1(ω0) =
˜ξ1 ≃ 2.40 and ξ2(ω0) = ˜ξ2 ≃ 5.52 are the ﬁrst and
the second roots of equation J0( ˜ξ) = 0. Then, the
self-collimation condition is exactly fulﬁlled at the cen-
tral frequency ω0, Ceﬀ (ω0) = 0, and simultaneously the
condition of frequency-independent coupling in Eq. (4)
is satisﬁed for the following modulation parameters,
A1 = [ ˜ξ1 ˜ξ2J1( ˜ξ2)/2π( ˜ξ2J1( ˜ξ2) − ˜ξ1J1( ˜ξ1))ω0]L/2, A2 =
−[J1( ˜ξ1)/J1( ˜ξ2)]A1, and z0 = 2πω0A1/ ˜ξ1. As a result,
we obtain an extremely ﬂat coupling curve shown in
Fig. 2(b) where the point ‘d’ corresponds to the cen-
tral frequency.
In this hybrid structure not only the
ﬁrst derivative vanishes according to Eq. (4), but the sec-

d2Ceﬀ (ω)/dω2
ond derivative vanishes as well,

the points ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ in (b). Waveguide width is 3µm
and substrate refractive index is n0 = 2.35.

C(ω) deﬁnes a coupling strength between the neighboring
waveguides, and it characterizes diﬀraction in a straight
waveguide array with x0 ≡ 0 [18, 19]. The coupling coeﬃ-
cient decreases at higher frequencies [20] and accordingly
the beam broadening is substantially weaker at shorter
wavelengths, see Figs. 1(b-e).

We consider symmetric proﬁles of the waveguide bend-
ing such that x0(z) = f (z − za) for a given coordinate
shift za, where function f (z) is symmetric, f (z) ≡ f (−z).
Then, after a full bending period (z → z + L) the beam
diﬀraction is the same as in a straight waveguide array
with the eﬀective coupling coeﬃcient [12, 17]

According to Eq. (3), diﬀraction of multicolor beams is
deﬁned by an interplay of bending-induced dispersion
and frequency dependence of the coupling coeﬃcient in
a straight waveguide array. We suggest that spatial evo-
lution of all frequency components can be synchronized
allowing for shaping and steering of multi-color beams,
when eﬀective coupling remains constant around the cen-
tral frequency ω0,

dCeﬀ (ω)/dω|ω=ω0 = 0,

and we demonstrate below that this condition can be
satisﬁed by introducing special bending proﬁles.

the maximum waveguide curvature is inversely propor-
tional to the period, max|¨x0(z)| ∼ L−1. Although the
beam evolution inside the array does depend on the wave-
length, the incident beam proﬁle is exactly restored after
a full modulation period, see examples in Figs. 2(c-e).
Self-collimation is preserved even at the red spectral edge,
where coupling length is the shortest and discrete diﬀrac-
tion in the straight array is the strongest [cf. Fig. 2(c)
and Fig. 1(c)]. The hybrid structure provides a dramatic
improvement in the bandwidth for self-collimation eﬀect
compared to the array with a simple sinusoidal modu-
lation, where beams exhibit diﬀraction under small fre-
quency detuning, see Figs. 2(f-h).

We now analyze

the

conditions

for

frequency-

independent normal or anomalous diﬀraction that may
ﬁnd applications for reshaping of multicolor beams. In
order to reduce the device dimensions,
it is desirable
to increase the absolute value of the eﬀective coupling
and simultaneously satisfy Eq. (4) to achieve broadband
diﬀraction management. We ﬁnd that Eq. (4) can be sat-
isﬁed even in the simplest two-segment hybrid structure
with z0 = L/2 and A1 = (ξ/2πω0) L/2. Here a set of
possible parameter values ξ is determined form the re-
lation J0(ξ)/J1(ξ) = C0ξ/C1ω0, where C0 = C(ω0) and
C1 = dC(ω)/dω|ω=ω0 characterize dispersion of coupling
in a straight array. It is possible to obtain both normal
and anomalous diﬀraction regimes for normally incident
beams, corresponding to positive and negative eﬀective
couplings Ceﬀ (ω0) = C0J0(ξ) depending on the chosen
value of ξ. For example, for the waveguide array shown
in Fig. 1, at the central frequency ω0 = 250 [correspond-
ing wavelength is λ0 = 532nm] coupling parameters
are C0 ≃ 0.13mm−1 and C1 ≃ −0.0021mm−1. Then,
constant positive coupling around the central frequency
Ceﬀ (ω0) ≃ 0.25C0 is realized for ξ ≃ 6.47 and constant
negative coupling Ceﬀ (ω0) ≃ −0.25C0 for ξ ≃ 2.97.

We perform a comprehensive analytical and numeri-
cal analysis, and ﬁnd that a hybrid structure with bend-
ing proﬁle consisting of one straight (i.e A1 ≡ 0) and
one sinusoidal segment can provide considerably im-

4

odic intensity revivals disappear for the multicolor input,
see Fig. 4(b). Multicolor Talbot eﬀect is also not pos-
sible in free space where revival period is proportional
to frequency. Most remarkably, multicolor Talbot ef-
fect can be observed in optimized waveguide arrays with
wavelength-independent diﬀraction, see Fig. 4(c). In this
example, we use the shape of structure with constant pos-
itive diﬀraction shown in Fig. 3, and choose half of the
bending period to be equal to the period of the Talbot
recurrences for the corresponding eﬀective coupling in
this structure, L(2)
T = (2π/3) [1/Ceﬀ(ω)]. We note that
the length of the straight segment is equal to the Tal-
bot distance at central wavelength in the straight array,
z0 = L(1)
T , which explains partial revivals at the end of
the straight segments visible in Fig. 4(c).

In conclusion, we have introduced a novel class of pho-
tonic structures where diﬀraction can be engineered in
a very broad frequency range. We have analyzed the
optimized array of periodically curved waveguides where
light beams experience wavelength-independent normal,
anomalous, or zero diﬀraction, and predicted the multi-
color Talbot eﬀect which is not possible in free space and
conventional waveguide arrays. Our results suggest novel
opportunities for eﬃcient self-collimation, focusing, and
reshaping of beams produced by white-light and super-
continuum sources.

this structure, the eﬀective coupling at central frequency

Example of a hybrid structure which provides strong
wavelength-independent diﬀraction is shown in Fig. 3(a),
and the corresponding eﬀective coupling is plotted in
Fig. 3(b). The output diﬀraction proﬁles in this opti-
mized structure are very similar in a broad spectral re-
gion, see examples for three wavelengths in Figs. 3(c-e).
We note that the outputs at these wavelengths are sub-
stantially diﬀerent after the same propagation length in
the straight waveguide array, as shown in Figs. 1(c-e).

As one of the applications of the broadband diﬀrac-
tion management we consider a multicolor Talbot eﬀect
which allows to manipulate white-light patterns. The
Talbot eﬀect, when any periodical monochromatic light
pattern reappears upon propagation at certain equally
spaced distances, has been known since the famous dis-
covery in 1836 [23].
It was recently shown that the
Talbot eﬀect is also possible in discrete systems for
certain periodic input patterns [20]. For example, for
the monochromatic periodic input pattern of the form
{1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, . . .}, Talbot revivals take place at the dis-
tance L(1)

T = (2π/3) [1/C(ω)], see Fig. 4(a).

Period of the discrete Talbot eﬀect in the waveguide
array is inversely proportional to the coupling coeﬃ-
cient C(ω), which strongly depends on frequency, see
Fig. 1(b). Therefore, for each speciﬁc frequency Talbot
recurrences occur at diﬀerent distances [20], and peri-

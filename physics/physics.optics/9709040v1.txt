Abstract

It is shown that the interference between spontaneous
emission into the non-lasing supermode and the laser
ﬁeld of a semiconductor laser array causes spatial hole-
burning which couples the dynamics of the spontaneous
emission with the laser ﬁeld. In particular, phase locking
between the spontaneous emission and the lasing mode
leads to the formation of a spectral triplet composed of
in-phase relaxation oscillation sidebands and an out-of-
phase line at the lasing frequency.

The investigation of spontaneous emission into the
non-lasing modes of a semiconductor laser operating in
cw-mode can provide valuable insights into the carrier
dynamics of the laser device1,2. This is especially use-
ful in the study of phase-locked laser arrays, such as
two-dimensional arrays of vertical cavity surface emit-
ting lasers (VCSEL arrays)3–6. Such coherently coupled
VCSEL arrays are fabricated e.g. to obtain maximal co-
herent output power. They usually exhibit stable anti-
phase locking between adjacent lasers resulting in the
lasing of only the supermode with highest frequency3–6.
However, there is still spontaneous emission into the
other non-lasing modes5. Generally, the interference
terms between the laser light and the non-lasing modes
determine the spatial intensity distribution inside the
laser cavity. The signiﬁcance of these terms depends
on the phase relation between the spontaneous emission
and the laser light. It is particularly strong if the spon-
taneous emission is in phase with the laser light. Con-
sequently one can expect that the in-phase spontaneous
emission will cause spatial hole-burning and spatial re-
laxation oscillations, while the out-of-phase spontaneous
emission will not couple to the carrier dynamics.

In this letter, we describe the dynamics of the lasing
antisymmetric supermode and the non-lasing symmet-
ric supermode of a two laser array using a rate equa-
tion model similar to the one introduced by Winful and
Wang7,8. In this model, the spatial distribution of the
carrier density is approximated by assigning separate
carrier densities to the individual lasers of the array.
For a two laser array, the dynamical equations of the
ﬁeld and the carrier densities may be written in terms

of the anti-symmetric supermode E− and the symmetric
supermode E+. The validity of this discretization of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld and the limitation to two modes
is established in a more detailed model based on par-
tial diﬀerential equations9. The total carrier density N ,
which is the sum of both carrier densities in the lasers,
interacts equally strong with both modes. The spatial
carrier density diﬀerence between the two lasers, ∆, is
a measure of spatial hole-burning eﬀects on the length
scale of the array. The dynamical equations then read

The linear optical properties of the laser cavity are given
by the loss rates κ+ and κ− and the frequencies at N = 0,
ω+ and ω−. The symmetric supermode E+ and the anti-
symmetric supermode E− are eigenmodes of the linear
optical equations. The optical coupling between the two
lasers is given by the diﬀerences between the eigenvalues,
ω+. The gain and the car-
s = κ+ −
rier induced frequency shift are represented by the linear
gain coeﬃcient w/2 and the linewidth enhancement fac-
tor α, respectively. w is the linear gain coeﬃcient of the
individual laser. The factor of 1/2 is a result of the nor-
malization of the electromagnetic modes in the two laser
array.

κ− and Ω = ω− −

The timescales of the carrier dynamics are given by the
injection rate above transparency µ, the recombination
rate at zero ﬁeld γ and a diﬀusion rate Γ. The diﬀusion
rate Γ may be derived from the ambipolar diﬀusion con-
stant of the carriers Ddiﬀ by solving the diﬀusion equa-
tion for a carrier density distribution modulated with a

1

period equal to the distance r between the lasers in the
array. The diﬀusion rate is thus

Γ =

4π2
r2 Ddiﬀ.

(2)

Note that such a treatment of diﬀusion represents an
extension of the original model of Winful and Wang7,8,
as discussed elsewhere10.

The stable solution of the array dynamics is given by
∆ = 0, N = 2κ−/w, E+ = 0 and E− = √I0 exp[
i(ω−+
ακ−)t], where the laser intensity I0 is a linear function
of the injection rate µ. The linearized dynamics of small
ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing mode E+ and the spatial

Note that ﬂuctuations in the lasing mode E− or the
total density N do not appear in the linearized equations
for E+ and ∆. The ﬂuctuations in the non-lasing mode
are therefore not correlated with the ﬂuctuations in the
lasing mode.

The laser ﬁeld itself does aﬀect the dynamics of ﬂuc-
tuations, however, as expressed by the ﬁnal terms of the
linearized equations which are sensitive to both the am-
plitude √I0 and the phase

are the quantum noise terms acting on the cavity mode
from the quantum vacuum outside the cavity and from
the dipole ﬂuctuations in the gain medium. Pump noise
in the carrier density has been neglected since its eﬀect
is much smaller than that of the quantum ﬂuctuations
in the case of strong relaxation oscillations investigated
in this letter. The minimal quantum ﬂuctuations for
complete inversion in the gain medium are given by

The ﬂuctuation dynamics depends on four timescales,
the damping coeﬃcients of the ﬁeld s and of the carrier
density diﬀerence γ + 2Γ + wI0, the frequency diﬀer-
ence between the supermodes Ω and the coupling fre-
quency between the ﬁeld and the carrier density dif-
ference
2κ−wI0. Note that this coupling frequency
is identical with the frequency of relaxation oscillations
in the total intensity. Physically, it represents the spa-
tial variations in the relaxation oscillations associated
with ﬂuctuating spatial hole-burning. If the spatial hole-
burning eﬀect represented by ∆ is negligible, the ﬂuc-
tuations in fk and f⊥ are rotations with frequency Ω
damped at a rate of s. This corresponds to a single
Lorentzian spontaneous emission line at ω+ with a width
of 2s.

p

We will now examine the opposite case of strong spa-
tial hole-burning eﬀects, however, which applies if the
frequency diﬀerence Ω is much smaller than the relax-
2κ−wI0. In this limit, the
ation oscillation frequency
light ﬁeld is phase locked to the laser ﬁeld by the spatial
p
hole-burning associated with the in-phase ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations fk. The ﬁeld dynamics separates into two un-
correlated solutions. The out-of-phase ﬂuctuations are
described by an exponential relaxation of ﬂuctuations in

The spectrum of the spontaneous emission into the
non-lasing mode is a triplet composed of a central line at
the laser frequency representing the out-of-phase emis-
sion processes and two sidebands representing the relax-
ation oscillations caused by in-phase spontaneous emis-
sion. The total spectrum reads

The Intensity is given in terms of the average photon
number inside the optical cavity. The emission rate is
found by multiplying with 2κ+. δω is the frequency dif-
ference to the position of the laser line at ω− + ακ−.
Figure 1 shows the spontaneous emission triplet of the
non-lasing supermode for a typical choice of parameters,
γ = 10 GHz, Γ = 20 GHz, κ− = 2000 GHz, α = 3,
Ω = 5 GHz and s = 15 GHz. The laser intensity is given
in units of γ/w, which typically corresponds to about
10000 photons in the cavity.

The central line does not change as the laser intensity
increases. The reason lies in the fact that the interfer-
ence term of the out-of-phase ﬂuctuations and the laser
light vanishes. The spatial intensity distribution is not
modiﬁed by out-of-phase spontaneous emission and no
spatial hole-burning results. Therefore, this component
of the spontaneous emission is the unchanged emission
from the carrier density N pinned at N = 2κ−/w.

±

p

The sidebands at δω =

2κ−wI0 represent that
part of the spontaneous emission which has a component
in phase with the laser light. The non-zero interference
term between the non-lasing mode and the laser light
causes spatial hole-burning as represented by the param-
eter ∆. Consequently, there are spatial relaxation oscil-
2κ−wI0.
lations at the relaxation oscillation frequency
Since the Interference term between the non-lasing mode
and the laser light represents the intensity diﬀerence be-
tween the two lasers in the array, the oscillation in the in-
phase component of the non-lasing ﬁeld fk corresponds
to a spatial intensity oscillation. The phase of the side-
band emission processes is not the same as the phase
of the laser ﬁeld, however. As can be seen in equation
(8), the out-of-phase component f⊥ is α times as large
as the in-phase component fk. This is a consequence
of the spatial change in the refractive index. While the

p

gain-guiding properties associated with a non-zero car-
rier density diﬀerence ∆ convert the ﬁeld of the lasing
supermode into the non-lasing supermode at the same
phase, the index guiding properties change the phase by
π/2. Since the ratio of the index guiding and the gain
guiding induced by the changes in carrier density is given
by α, the phase diﬀerence between the laser ﬁeld and the
relaxation oscillation sidebands of the non-lasing mode
is equal to arctan(α).

Since the relaxation oscillation sidebands represent
the spatial eﬀects induced by the in-phase component
of spontaneous emission into the non-lasing mode, the
linewidth, the frequency, and the total intensity are a
function of the carrier dynamics as well as of the laser
ﬁeld. The dependence on laser intensity is shown in ﬁg-
ure 2, in which the out-of-phase contribution has been
removed. The total intensity in the two sidebands Isb
compared to the total intensity of the central line Icl is

The diﬀusion Γ and the total rate of induced and spon-
taneous transitions γ + wI0 both suppress spontaneous
emission processes into the non-lasing supermode by
damping the carrier density diﬀerence ∆. In this man-
ner, the total spontaneous emission into the non-lasing
supermode decreases as laser intensity increases, even
though the average carrier density remains pinned at
N = 2κ−/w.

The spontaneous emission triplet of the non-lasing su-
permode should be observable in the spectrum emitted
from the symmetric non-lasing supermode of the laser
array cavity. Since the symmetric supermode has its
far-ﬁeld intensity maximum in the center of the far-ﬁeld,
where the stable anti-symmetric laser mode should have
zero intensity, it seems likely, that this spectrum can be
observed by measurements of the weak intensities in the
center of the far ﬁeld. The assumptions of the model ap-
plied in this letter may then be tested by measurements
of the linewidths and frequencies. An interesting point
would be the comparison of sideband intensities. If the
coherent coupling Ω is such that
Ω does
not hold anymore, then the lower frequency sideband in-
tensity should be stronger than the high frequency side-
band intensity – up to the point where Ω
2κ−wI0
and there is a single spontaneous emission line left at
ω+. This case would imply extremely strong coupling
between the individual lasers of the array, however, im-
plying that the array acts as a single laser with a modi-
ﬁed cavity.

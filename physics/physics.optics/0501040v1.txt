Comparison of Nonlinear Phase Noise and
Intrachannel Four-Wave-Mixing for RZ-DPSK
Signals in Dispersive Transmission Systems

Keang-Po Ho, Senior Member, IEEE and Hsi-Cheng Wang

Abstract— Self-phase modulation induced nonlinear phase
noise is reduced with the increase of ﬁber dispersion but
intrachannel four-wave-mixing (IFWM) is increased with dis-
persion. Both degrading DPSK signals, the standard deviation of
nonlinear phase noise induced differential phase is about three
times that from IFWM even in highly dispersive transmission
systems.

four-wave-mixing, ﬁber nonlinearities

I. INTRODUCTION

R ECENTLY, differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) sig-

nal has been studied extensively for long-haul lightwave
transmissions [1]–[4]. Mostly for 40-Gb/s systems, DPSK
signal has 3-dB receiver sensitivity improvement and provides
good tolerance to ﬁber nonlinearities than on-off keying. Most
DPSK experiments use return-to-zero (RZ) pulse and launch
a pulse train with phase modulated to each RZ pulse.

The interaction of ﬁber Kerr effect with ampliﬁer noise
induces nonlinear phase noise [5]–[8], or more precisely,
self-phase modulation (SPM) induced nonlinear phase noise.
Added directly to the signal phase, as shown later, nonlinear
phase noise is the major degradation for DPSK signals.

When RZ pulse broadens by chromatic dispersion and
overlaps with each other, the pulse-to-pulse collision gives
intrachannel cross-phase modulation (IXPM) and four-wave-
mixing (IFWM) [9], [10]. While IXPM has no effect on DPSK
signals, IFWM adds ghost pulses to each DPSK RZ pulse
[11]–[15].

For RZ-DPSK signals, the variance of the nonlinear phase
noise is derived here analytically, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst
time. Comparing with the IFWM variance from [14], [15], the
phase noise standard deviation (STD) from nonlinear phase
noise is about three times larger than that from IFWM even
at highly dispersive transmission systems.

II. NONLINEAR PHASE NOISE FOR RZ PULSES

For a comparison to IFWM, nonlinear phase noise is eval-
uated based on the model of [11]–[15]. Assumed a Gaussian

spreading over time than ∆u′

IFWM scales up by a factor of
times increase in the width of IFWM ghost pulse [11], [12],
[15]. Figure 2 also includes the corresponding result for non-
return-to-zero (NRZ) signal at D = 0 [7], [16].

The IFWM-induced ghost pulses give a phase noise variance
increase with ﬁber dispersion. With large ﬁber dispersion and
signiﬁcant pulse overlap, more terms induce ghost pulses and
the overall contribution from IFWM increases slowly with
ﬁber dispersion. From (1), ﬁber dispersion reduces the pulse
amplitude but the increase of number of terms balances that
out. For D > 7 ps/km/nm, the contribution from IFWM
increases slowly with the increase of ﬁber dispersion.

The STD from nonlinear phase noise of σ∆φn reduces with
ﬁber dispersion. Even with large ﬁber dispersion, σ∆φn from
nonlinear phase noise is about three times larger than that from
IFWM. Figure 2 also shows the STD of ∆φn with contribution
from only SPM of ζ0,0 and ζ1,1. At large dispersion, the
contribution from IXPM phase noise of ζm,k, m
= k is larger
than that from SPM of ζm,m. With an interesting implication,
the STD of σ∆φn closes to that for NRZ signal at large
dispersion. The results of [7], [8] are approximately correct
for RZ pulses for system with large dispersion.
Figure 2 is for N identical ﬁber spans with

= 1 rad.
For arbitrary link conﬁguration, the integration of (11) can
be replaced by N integrations for each span. Figure 2 also
assumes an optical match ﬁlter of to = T0. The function of

ΦNLi
h

fm(ω) is valid for general Gaussian optical ﬁlter but other
ﬁlter types are possible, may be required another layer of
integration.

For lossless ﬁber, both [17], [18] studied nonlinear phase
noise with chromatic dispersion for continuous-wave signal
[17] and without IXPM phase noise [18].

III. CONCLUSION

The variance of nonlinear phase noise is derived analytically
for RZ-DPSK signals in highly dispersive transmission sys-
tems. For an initial pulse width of T0 = 5 ps, the phase noise
STD from nonlinear phase noise is about three times larger
than that from IFWM at large ﬁber dispersion of D = 17
ps/km/nm. Nonlinear phase noise typically degrades a DPSK
signal more than IFWM ghost pulses.

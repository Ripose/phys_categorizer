Channel drop ﬁlters in a plasmon-polaritons metal are studied. It shows that light can be eﬃ-
ciently dropped. Results obtained by the FDTD method are consistent with those from coupled
mode theory. It also shows, without considering the loss of the metal, that the quality factor for the
channel drop system reaches 4000. The quality factor decreases signiﬁcantly if we take into account
the loss, which also leads to a weak drop eﬃciency.

INTRODUCTION

Channel drop ﬁlters (CDFs), which single out one
channel from wavelength division multiplexed signals,
and pass through other channels undisturbed, are use-
ful and essential elements for photonic integrated circuits
and dense wavelength division multiplexing optical com-
munication systems [1, 2, 3, 4]. Various CDFs exist,
such as ﬁber Bragg gratings, Fabry-Perot ﬁlters, and ar-
rayed waveguide gratings. Resonant CDFs, which involve
waveguide/cavity interaction, are attractive candidates
for this purpose because they can potentially realize the
narrowest linewidth for a given device size. In particu-
lar, resonant CDFs implemented in photonic crystals can
be made ultra-compact and highly wavelength selective
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

A surface plasmon (SP) is a collective oscillation of the
electrons at the interface between a metal and a dielec-
tric. SPs give rise to surface-plasmon-waves, which are
propagating electromagnetic waves bound at the metal-
dielectric interface [10, 11, 12, 13]. A usual dielectric
waveguide cannot restrict the spatial localization of op-
tical energy beyond the λ0/2n limit, where λ0 is the
free space photon wavelength and n is the refractive in-
dex of the waveguide. As opposed to dielectric waveg-
uides, plasmonic waveguides have shown the potential
to guide subwavelength optical modes, the so-called sur-
face plasmon polaritons (SPP), at metal-dielectric inter-
faces, such as metallic nanowires [14, 15] and metallic
nanoparticle arrays [16, 17].
In this letter, we investi-
gate disk/ring resonator channel drop ﬁlters realized in a
two-dimensional (2D) plasmon-polaritons metal using a
ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method [18] with
perfect matched layer boundary conditions, together with
the coupled mode theory. A combination of FDTD tech-
niques and Pade approximation with Baker’s algorithm is
used for the quality factor of the system and unload res-
onant cavity [19, 20]. In our numerical calculations, the
ring/disk resonator is described by a spatial discretiza-

∗Electronic address: min@imit.kth.se

tion grid in FDTD method, which naturally introduces
a surface roughness. It has been shown that the surface
roughness leads to back reﬂections into the counter prop-
agating mode and a splitting of the resonant peak [21].
Here, we use a spatial grid size of 2.5nm in FDTD algo-
rithm which we found to be suﬃcient for the convergence
of numerical results.

FIG. 1: Channel drop ﬁlter structure realized in a plasmon-
polaritons metal with (a) an air disk resonator; (b) a ring
resonator.

Consider ﬁrstly a resonant channel drop ﬁlter with an
air circular disk resonator in a plasmon-polaritons metal,
where the waveguide and the resonator are introduced
by removing the metal with a speciﬁc shape. The corre-
sponding structure is shown in Fig. 1 (a), where d, L and
R is the waveguide width, distance between the bound-
aries of the air disk and the waveguide, and the radius
of the air disk resonator, respectively. The radium of the
air disk is chosen as 1µm, and the dielectric function of
the metal (Silver) is described by the loss Drude model:

ε(ω) = ε∞ −

(ε0 − ε∞)ω2
p
ω2 + 2iωνc

,

(1)

where ε∞/ε0 is the relative permittivity at inﬁnite/zero
frequency, ωp is the plasma frequency, and νc is the col-
lision frequency. We choose ε∞ = 4.017, ε0 = 4.896,
ωp = 1.419 × 1016rad/s and νc = 1.117 × 1014rad/s for
the Drude model, which ﬁts the experimental data quite
well [22]. The waveguide width, chosen as 60nm, is much
smaller than the wavelength so that only the fundamen-
tal transverse magnetic (T M ) waveguide mode is excited.
Our studies show, to realize a CDF system, that the T M0
mode waveguide is preferred. The reason is that, com-
pared with the T M0 mode waveguide, it is much diﬃcult
to couple the energy from the waveguide to the resonator

for the higher-order T M mode waveguide, which almost
act as a perfect metallic waveguide.

Coupled mode or scattering theory are used to ana-
lyze theoretically the interaction of a cavity resonator
with a waveguide system [2, 23]. But these works con-
sider waveguides with continuous translation symmetry
and ignore waveguide dispersion. Waks et. al. derive
an analytical coupled mode theory including waveguide
dispersion , especially for a photonic crystal waveguide
[24]. However, for such a SPP waveguide, the conven-
tional coupled mode or scattering theory are also often
suitable since the dispersion for the SPP waveguide is
quite weak in the frequency region of interest, as well as
for a optical ﬁber waveguide. According to the coupled
mode theory, we can easily obtain the ﬁlter response of
the system [2]

where ω0 is the resonant frequency, 1/τo and 1/τe are
the decay rate due to loss and the rate of decay into
the bus/drop waveguide, R is the reﬂection from the in-
put port, T is the transmission through the bus and DL
and DR represent the transmission into the left and right
ports of the receiver. 1/τe1,3 and 1/τe2,4, deﬁned as the
decay rates in the forward and backward direction, sat-

In a travelling-wave mode, the power ﬂows continu-
ously in only one direction in the resonator. It can be
easily obtained that the incident power in the bus in the
forward direction is partially transferred to the receiver
in the backward direction, limited only by the loss for the
unloaded resonator, i.e., for 1/τ0 = 0 the channel with
resonant frequency ω0, can be transferred completely into
the drop waveguide. For a pure standing-wave mode,
the resonant mode decays equally into the forward and
backward propagating waveguide mode. From Eqs. (2)-
(5), one knows that the maximum drop eﬃciency is
|DL|2 = |DR|2 = 0.25(1 − τe/τo),
i.e, half the input
power at resonant frequency can be dropped into the
drop waveguide if the loss for the unloaded resonator is
ignored.

Look back to the channel drop ﬁlter system, as shown
in Fig. 1 (a). Not only surface travelling resonant modes,
but also standing wave modes in the air disk resonator

will be excited. Our calculations show that the intrin-
sic quality factor (Q) for the unload resonator is quite
large and reaches 1010 if we ignore the loss of the metal,
and the quality factor (Qk) for the ﬁlter system is about
600 with the resonant frequency f = 1.261(1/µm) (nor-
malized to light velocity in vacuum c) when the distance
between the waveguide and resonator is L = 25nm. Ba-
sically, Qk can increase if we enlarge L. Based on the
coupled mode analysis above, almost 100% power can be
dropped by the surface-travelling mode, while the drop
eﬃciency at one output based on standing waves is quite
small, at most 25%. The spectral response after 500, 000
time steps, for L = 25nm, are shown in Fig. 2(a), where
the solid and dotted line represent the transmission at
the forward bus and backward drop waveguide, respec-
tively. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that the light can
be eﬃciently dropped for some frequencies. For some
resonant frequencies, the drop eﬃciency is quite high,
close to 100%, due to the surface travelling mode. How-
ever, the drop eﬃciency, governed by the standing wave,
is below 25%, which is in agreement with results from
coupled mode theory. Figure 3(a) shows the oscillation
of the steady-state ﬁeld distribution at a resonant fre-
quency with f = 1.404(1/µm) , where almost all energy
is dropped by a surface travelling resonant wave.

One important factor characterizing a channel drop
ﬁlter is its channel
isolation (CI), deﬁned as CI =
10log(P1/P2), where P1 and P2 are the power of the se-
lected channel transferred to the drop waveguide and the
power remaining in the bus respectively. The channel
isolation should be as large as possible to avoid the cross
talk. For the resonator with a surface travelling mode
mentioned above, CI is quite large and theoretically in-
ﬁnite if ignored the loss of the metal. However, CI for
a single-mode standing wave resonator is quite small. It
is possible to get a high CI for a single-mode travelling-

wave resonant ﬁlter using two standing-wave modes. In
this letter, to avoid exciting the standing-wave modes in
the resonator, a channel drop ﬁlter with a ring resonator
is investigated, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The width of
the ring waveguide is same as the bus/drop waveguide
and the outer radius of the ring resonator is also cho-
sen as 1µm. Mechanism in this system is quite similar
to the conventional ring resonator. Coupled mode the-
ory tells us that a single-mode travelling wave resonator
side-coupled to the bus and the receiver can fully transfer
a channel at the resonant frequency from the bus to the
receiver, only limited by Qk/Q.

The spectral response at both the forward bus (solid
line) and backward drop waveguide (dotted line) are
shown in Fig. 3(b) when L = 25nm. It can be seen from
Fig. 3(b) that light can be almost completely dropped
for resonant frequencies. The results for the resonant
frequency f = 1.201(1/µm), obtained by coupled mode
theory, are shown in Fig. 3(c) by circled and asterisk
lines. It can be seen from Fig. 3(c) that those obtained
from coupled mode theory are consistent with the re-
sults by FDTD method. Combined with the resonant
conditions (N × 2π = 2πRnef f k0), the eﬀective index
(nef f ) for the ring waveguide with the width of 60nm,
is about 1.339 for the resonant frequency 1.426(1/µm)
from the FDTD results. However, the eﬀective index for
the straight waveguide with the same width is 1.501 for
the same resonant frequency. There is still no any good
analytical approximate method to calculate the eﬀective
index of the ring waveguide when the working wavelength
is close to the radius of the ring. Figure 4(b) shows the
oscillation of the steady-state ﬁeld distribution at a res-
onant frequency with f = 1.426(1/µm), where almost
100% of the ﬁeld energy is transferred along the back-
ward drop waveguide. However, the quality factor for
the ﬁlter is quite slow, only about 250 for the resonant
frequency f = 1.426(1/µm). Since the intrinsic quality
factor for the unload resonator is much high, the quality
factor of the channel drop ﬁlter can be increased if we en-
large the distance between waveguide and ring resonator,
which also keeps a high drop eﬃciency. Qk reaches 4×103
when L = 50nm.

A metal (ε(ω) = εr + iεi) is always a loss material
especially in the visible and infrared frequency region,

3

which satisﬁes εr < 0 and | εr |≫ εi. The loss problem
for a straight SPP waveguide can be dealt with the ﬁrst-
order perturbation theory, which considers the imaginary
part of permittivity as a perturbation for the real part of
permittivity. Consider a channel drop ﬁlter with a ring
resonator in a lossy plasmon-polaritons metal. If we take
into account the loss of the metal, the quality factor for
the unloaded resonant cavity decreases signiﬁcantly. Q
is only about 60 for the cavity with a radius of 1µm. To
increase the drop eﬃciency, we shorten the distance be-
tween the waveguide and the cavity in order to enlarge
the coupling. We set the source and two detectors with
a distance of 0.5µm with the center of the ring resonator
in the propagation direction. For the channel drop ﬁlter
system with L = 10nm, the quality factor of the channel
drop ﬁlter is only 30, which leads to weak drop eﬃciency.
The spectral response at both the forward bus (solid line)
and backward drop waveguide (dotted line) are shown in
Fig. 4. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the drop eﬃ-
ciency is quite slow, as well as the quality factor. The
drop eﬃciency becomes larger with increasing the res-
onant frequency. Since the quality factor for the ﬁlter
becomes smaller with increasing the resonant frequency,
based on the coupled mode theory, the drop eﬃciency
will naturally increase.

In Conclusion, we have investigated channel drop ﬁl-
ters in a plasmon-polaritons metal. Our results show that
light can be eﬃciently dropped in these channel drop sys-
tems. The results obtained by FDTD method are consis-
tent with the results from coupled mode theory. Without
considering the loss of the metal, the quality factor of the
channel drop systems reaches 4000. However, the quality
factor decreases signiﬁcantly if we take into account the
loss of the metal. For the channel drop system in a loss
metal with L = 10nm, the maximum drop eﬃciency is
about 30% and the quality factor is only 30. Recently,
many theoretical and experimental results show that us-
ing surface plasmon polaritons the scale of optoelectronic
devices can be shrunk by at least an order of magnitude
[25]. People used dielectrics with gains to compensate the
loss of the metal [26]. However, the loss of the plasmon-

polaritons metal is still a problem.

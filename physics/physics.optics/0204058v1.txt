Abstract

We demonstrate a technique for locking the frequency of a tunable diode laser

to a ring-cavity resonator. The resonator is stabilized to a diode laser which

is in turn locked to an atomic transition, thus giving it absolute frequency

calibration. The ring-cavity design has the principal advantage that there is

no feedback destabilization of the laser. The cavity has a free-spectral range

of 1.3 GHz and Q of about 35, which gives robust locking of the laser. The

locked laser is able to track large scans of the cavity.

The easy availability of diode lasers over most of the near-infrared spectrum has led to

their widespread use in atomic and optical physics experiments [1]. The principal advantages

of these lasers lie in their low cost, narrow spectral width, tunability over several nm, eﬃcient

power consumption, reliability, and ease of operation. In addition, by placing a single-mode

diode in an external cavity and using optical feedback from an angle-tuned grating, it can

be made to operate at single frequency (single longitudinal mode) with linewidth of order 1

MHz [2,3]. Such frequency-stabilized diode lasers ﬁnd applications in several experiments as

low-cost replacements for ring-cavity dye or Ti-sapphire lasers. In particular, experiments

on laser cooling have become accessible to a large community of researchers because several

alkali atoms and alkali-like ions have cooling transitions which are accessible with diode

lasers [4]. However, to use lasers in such applications eﬀectively it is necessary to set their

absolute frequency with ∼MHz precision.

In many cases, this is achieved by locking the

laser to a known atomic or molecular transition using saturated-absorption spectroscopy in

a vapor cell. But this may not always be possible, especially when working with short-lived

radioactive species or trapped ions.

In this Letter, we solve this problem by locking a tunable diode laser to a stabilized

ring-cavity resonator. Tunable lasers are traditionally locked to linear Fabry-Perot reference

cavities. In fact, several commercial dye and Ti-sapphire lasers use a temperature-controlled

linear cavity for locking. The main problem with such a design for the diode laser is that it

can cause unwanted feedback into the laser and destabilize it. By contrast, our ring-cavity

design has a traveling wave inside the cavity and there is no possibility of feedback into the

laser. The ring cavity has several other advantages:

i) The cavity provides at least three

output beams that can be used to measure the signal from the cavity.

ii) The angle of

incidence on the cavity mirrors is not normal, therefore the mode structure inside the cavity

is elliptical; diode laser outputs are also elliptical, and this makes it easier to mode-match

the output of the diode laser into the cavity.

iii) The design is compact and the cavity is

easily temperature controlled to increase its passive stability.

The cavity is actively stabilized to a diode laser (called the “master laser”) that is

2

itself locked to an atomic transition. Using a diode laser locked to an atomic transition as

the absolute frequency reference has several advantages over alternatives such as using a

stabilized HeNe laser. The atomic transition typically has several hyperﬁne peaks and the

laser can be locked to any of them. For example, we use the D2 line in Rb for locking the

master laser. Rb has two stable isotopes, and two ground-state hyperﬁne levels and four

excited-state hyperﬁne levels in each isotope. Thus, there are potentially 24 lock points

available in the saturated-absorption spectrum [5], with frequencies varying over a range of

several 100 MHz. Now, when the arbitrary frequency of a tunable laser (called the “slave

laser”) has to be set, its frequency will generally be oﬀset from the cavity resonance, and the

oﬀset can be as large as the cavity free-spectral range. This oﬀset is accounted for by shifting

the laser frequency using an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and then locking to the cavity.

If the cavity is stabilized to a single frequency from a HeNe laser, the free-spectral range of

the cavity has to be quite small so that the frequency oﬀset lies within the range of the AOM,

which is typically limited to 100–200 MHz. This implies the use of long cavities with their

concomitant diﬃculty in maintaining temperature stability. By contrast, the wide range

of lock frequencies available with the atomic transition means that the cavity free-spectral

range can be of order GHz, and it is still possible to ﬁnd one lock point for which the slave

laser frequency lies within the range of the AOM. One other advantage of using a diode

laser locked to an atomic transition is that it makes scanning of the slave laser quite simple.

The master laser can be scanned over a large frequency range around the atomic transition

by changing its grating angle, and the slave laser tracks this scan. This kind of scanning is

quite important in spectroscopy experiments.

The schematic of our system is shown in Fig. 1. The master laser is tuned to the D2 line

of atomic Rb at 780 nm (5S1/2 ↔ 5P3/2 transition). It is locked to one of the hyperﬁne peaks

or crossover resonances in the saturated-absorption spectrum. The absolute frequency of the

Rb D2 line has been measured previously with kHz accuracy [6], therefore the frequency of

this laser is known very precisely. The error signal for the locking is obtained by modulating

the injection current into the diode. Next, the cavity is stabilized by locking it to the master

3

laser frequency. The error signal for this is obtained by modulating the cavity length using

a piezo-mounted mirror. Finally, the slave laser is locked to a cavity resonance by dithering

its injection current. All the modulation frequencies are in the range of 10–50 kHz and the

lock-in ampliﬁers are home built around the Analog Devices AD630 mixer chip.

The two diode laser systems are built around commercial single-mode laser diodes. The

output is ﬁrst collimated using a 4.5 mm, 0.55 NA aspheric lens. The laser is then frequency

stabilized in a standard external-cavity design (Littrow conﬁguration) [2] using optical feed-

back from an 1800 lines/mm diﬀraction grating mounted on a piezoelectric transducer. For

the master laser, a part of the output beam is tapped for Doppler-free saturated-absorption

spectroscopy in a Rb vapor cell. The laser is locked to one of the hyperﬁne transitions in the

D2 line by feeding the error signal to the piezoelectric transducer that controls the grating

angle. The slave laser is tuned near the D1 line of Rb at 795 nm.

The ring cavity consists of two plane mirrors and two concave mirrors in a bow-tie

arrangement, as shown in Fig. 1. One of the plane mirrors is partially reﬂecting (97%) and

is used to couple light into the cavity. The second plane mirror is mounted on a piezoelectric

transducer and is used to adjust the cavity length electronically. The two concave mirrors

have radius of curvature of 25 mm. The concave mirrors are placed 26.5 mm apart, while

the optical path length between them through the plane mirrors is 200 mm. The angle of

incidence on all mirrors is 15o. The mirrors are mounted on a 10-mm thick copper plate

that is temperature controlled to ±0.01oC using a thermoelectric cooler.

We have analyzed the cavity using standard ABCD matrices for Gaussian beam propa-

gation [7]. Because of the non-zero angle of incidence on the curved mirrors, it is necessary

to analyze the sagittal and tangential planes separately. The cavity modes are therefore

elliptical. The cavity has two beam waists, a small one of diameter 13.8 µm ×13.4 µm be-

tween the concave mirrors and a large one of diameter 224 µm ×119 µm between the plane

mirrors. The larger waist is used for eﬃcient mode matching of the laser beams into the

cavity. The output of the diode lasers is directly fed into the cavity through a lens of focal

length 50 cm. About 15% of the light gets coupled into the cavity. Using an anamorphic

4

prism pair after the diode laser, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity of the input beam and

improve the coupling eﬃciency to 50%, but we do not do this on a routine basis.

The cavity has been designed to have a Q of about 30. The measured cavity modes are

shown in Fig. 2 which is a plot of the power inside the cavity as a function of the cavity

length. The measured Q is 35, which is close to the designed value. The free spectral range

is 1.3 GHz corresponding to a cavity length of 226.5 mm. This implies that the cavity

modes have a linewidth of about 37 MHz. The low Q of the cavity ensures that the locking

of the slave laser is robust and is quite insensitive to sudden perturbations. The error signal

obtained by modulating the cavity length is fed to the piezo-mounted mirror to lock the

cavity to the master laser. The piezoelectric transducer has a full deﬂection of 6.1 µm for

a voltage of 150 V. This gives a wide dynamic range for the cavity to track scans of the

master laser.

There are two ways to produce the error signal for locking the slave laser to the stabilized

cavity. The ﬁrst technique, which is easier to implement, is to modulate the injection current

into the slave laser. The second technique is to modulate the frequency of the AOM which

is used to shift the frequency of the laser and match it to a cavity resonance. The second

technique has the advantage that the laser frequency does not vary and there is no increase

in its linewidth. However, the scheme is complicated because it requires double passing

through the AOM in order to maintain directional stability. Therefore, we have used the

ﬁrst technique in these experiments.

In order to test the ability of the slave laser to track scans of the master laser, we have

used the slave laser to measure transitions on the Rb D1 line (5S1/2 ↔ 5P1/2 transition)

while it was locked to the cavity. The slave laser is ﬁrst tuned near the D1 line by measuring

its frequency using a home-built wavemeter [8]. The wavemeter also uses the master laser

locked to the atomic transition for absolute frequency calibration. This gives us the slave-

laser frequency with an accuracy of about 20 MHz. The frequency shift in the AOM is then

adjusted so that the slave laser is on a cavity resonance and the laser is then locked to the

cavity. The master laser is now scanned over a frequency range of several 100 MHz. The

5

saturated-absorption spectrum of the 5S1/2, F = 2 → 5P1/2, F ′ transitions in 85Rb is shown

in Fig. 3. We see that the slave laser is able to track scans of order GHz or more without

losing lock.

In conclusion, we have shown that the frequency of a tunable diode laser can be locked

using a stabilized ring-cavity resonator. The ring cavity has several advantages over a linear

etalon, the main one being that there is no feedback destabilization of the laser. The cavity

is stabilized using a diode laser which is in turn locked to an atomic transition. The atomic

transition has several peaks in the spectrum, and thus provides several calibrated frequency

markers for locking. The cavity we have used in the current experiments has a free spectral

range of 1.3 GHz and a Q of 35. The low Q allows robust locking of the slave laser. The

piezo-mounted mirror in the cavity has a wide dynamic range that allows large scans of the

master laser to be tracked by the slave laser. We have veriﬁed that the slave laser stays

locked while the master laser is scanned over a frequency range of 1 GHz or more. The

cavity modes have a linewidth of about 37 MHz and this determines the tightness of the

lock. In future, we plan to use a longer cavity with free spectral range of about 500 MHz

and mode linewidth of 15 MHz. We expect to get much tighter locking with the new design.

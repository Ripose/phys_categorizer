We demonstrate a simple method for controlling nonlinear switching of discrete solitons in arrays
of weakly coupled optical waveguides, for both cubic and quadratic nonlinearities. Based on the
eﬀective discrete nonlinear equations describing the waveguide arrays in the tight-binding approx-
imation, we develop the concept of the array engineering by means of a step-like variation of the
waveguide coupling. We demonstrate the digitized switching of a narrow input beam for up to
eleven neighboring waveguides, in the case of the cubic nonlinearity, and up to ten waveguides, in
the case of quadratic nonlinearity. We discuss our predictions in terms of the physics of the engi-
neered Peierls-Nabarro (PN) potential experienced by strongly localized nonlinear modes moving in
a lattice and calculate, for the ﬁrst time, the PN potential for the quadratic nonlinear array. We also
conﬁrm our concept and major ﬁndings for a full-scaled continuous model and realistic parameters,
by means of the beam propagation method.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Discrete nonlinear systems are known to support self-
localized modes that exist due to an interplay between
a coupling between the lattice sites and nonlinearity [1].
Such spatially localized modes of discrete lattices existing
without defects are known as discrete solitons or intrinsic
localized modes, and they appear in many diverse areas of
physics, such as biophysics, nonlinear optics, solid state
physics [2, 3]. More recently, such modes have been pre-
dicted in the studies of the Bose-Einstein condensates in
optical lattices [4] and photonic-crystal waveguides and
circuits [5].

One of the most important applications of discrete
solitons is found in nonlinear optics where discrete
optical solitons were ﬁrst suggested theoretically by
Christodoulides and Joseph [6] for an array of weakly
coupled optical waveguides. Because the use of discrete
solitons promises an eﬃcient way to realize and control
multi-port nonlinear switching in systems of many cou-
pled waveguides, this ﬁeld has been explored extensively
during the last ten years in a number of theoretical pa-
pers (see, e.g., Refs. [7, 8, 9] as an example). More im-
portantly, the discrete solitons have also been generated
experimentally in fabricated periodic waveguide struc-
tures (see, e.g., some original papers reporting on the
experimental observations [10, 11] and also the recent
review papers [12, 13, 14]).

The majority of theoretical studies conducted so far
is devoted to the analysis of diﬀerent types of station-
ary localized modes in discrete models and their stabil-
ity. Consequently, experimental papers have reported
on the observation of self-trapped states in the peri-
odic systems with broken translational symmetry and
some of their properties, in both focusing and defocus-
ing regimes [12, 13, 14]. However, only very few studies
and experimental demonstrations addressed more speciﬁc

properties of localized modes introduced by discreteness
such as the soliton steering in and discreteness-induced
trapping by the lattice (see, e.g., Ref. [15]). As a result,
a very little eﬀort has been made so far to link these
ﬁndings with realistic applications of discrete solitons for
multi-port all-optical switching.

Indeed, one of the major problems for achieving con-
trollable multi-port all-optical switching of discrete soli-
tons in waveguide arrays is the existence of an eﬀective
periodic Peierls-Nabarro (PN) potential which appears
due to the lattice discreteness. As a consequence of this
potential, a narrow large-amplitude discrete soliton does
not propagate freely in the lattice and, instead, it be-
comes trapped by the array. Several ideas to exploit
the discreteness properties of the array for digitized all-
optical switching have been suggested [16, 17]. However,
the main result of those earlier studies is the observa-
tion that the discrete solitons can be well controlled only
in the limit of broad beams whereas the soliton dynam-
ics in highly discrete arrays has been shown to be more
complicated and even chaotic [17].

In this paper, we explore in detail an eﬀective way to
control nonlinear switching of discrete solitons in arrays
of weakly coupled optical waveguides earlier suggested
in our brief letter [18]. First, using the discrete model
valid in the tight-binding approximation, we estimate the
PN potential experienced by a strongly localized nonlin-
ear mode moving in a cubic nonlinear waveguide array.
The result suggests a possible control mechanism for the
switching of strongly localized excitations by means of a
step-like variation of the waveguide coupling. For par-
ticular types of the engineered arrays, we are able to
demonstrate the digitized switching of a narrow input
beam for up to eleven waveguides. Second, we demon-
strate the validity of predictions made in the framework
of the discrete model by performing a full-scaled contin-
uous simulation using realistic parameters. In addition,

we extend the concept of controllable digitized switch-
ing of discrete optical solitons to the case of quadratic
nonlinear waveguide arrays, where the experimental ob-
servation of discrete optical solitons has been reported
very recently [19]. Here, we obtain, for the ﬁrst time to
our knowledge, the PN potential for the discrete soliton
and demonstrate digitized switching for up to ten waveg-
uides.

In Sec.

The paper is organized as following.

II we
study the arrays of cubic nonlinear waveguides. First,
we consider the system dynamics described by the dis-
crete nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, and show how to
modulate the waveguide coupling in order to suppress
the chaotic dynamics and achieve fully controllable dig-
itized switching. We also employ the beam propagation
method and simulate numerically a more realistic contin-
uous model of the waveguide arrays with realistic param-
eters, and conﬁrm that our concept can be very useful for
optimization of the soliton switching in realistic settings.
Next, in Sec. III we extend our analysis to the arrays of
weakly coupled quadratic nonlinear waveguides, where
discrete quadratic solitons are composed of the beams
of the fundamental and second-harmonic ﬁelds. Finally,
Sec. IV concludes the paper.

II. CUBIC NONLINEAR WAVEGUIDES

The most common theoretical approach to study the
discrete optical solitons in arrays of weakly coupled op-
tical waveguides is based on the decomposition of the
electric ﬁeld of the periodic photonic structure into a
sum of weakly coupled fundamental modes excited in
each waveguide of the array; in solid-state physics this
approach is known as the tight-binding approximation.
According to this approach, the wave dynamics can be
described by an eﬀective discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger
(DNLS) equation, that possesses spatially localized sta-
tionary solutions in the form of discrete localized modes.
Many properties of the discrete optical solitons can be an-
alyzed in the framework of this approach and the DNLS
equation [6, 9].

A. Discrete model

A standard model of a weakly coupled array of cubic
nonlinear waveguides is described by the DNLS equa-
tion [6] that we write in the normalized form [20],

the n-th waveguide, the normalized parameter V is pro-
portional to the propagation constant of a single waveg-
uide and it characterizes the coupling between the neigh-

boring waveguides, and z is the propagation distance
along the waveguide. The parameter γ = ω0n2/(cAeﬀ ) is
the eﬀective waveguide nonlinearity associated with the
Kerr nonlinearity of the core material. Figure 1 shows a
typical experimental structure of a quasi-one-dimensional
homogeneous waveguide array and the excitation scheme
for generating a discrete optical soliton.

Steering and trapping of discrete optical solitons in
the framework of the model (1) have been analyzed in
a number of theoretical studies. Being kicked by an ex-
ternal force, the discrete soliton propagates through the
lattice for some distance, but then it gets trapped by
the lattice due to the discreteness eﬀects. For a larger
kick, the output soliton position ﬂuctuates between two
(or more) neighboring waveguides making the switching
uncontrollable [17].

In order to show this known feature, ﬁrst we consider
homogeneous arrays and select an input proﬁle in the
form of a narrow sech-like beam localized on a few waveg-
uides,

un(0) = A sech[A(n

nc)/√2] e−ik(n−nc),

for n
1, and un(0) = 0, otherwise. For the
particular results presented below, we consider the array
of 101 waveguides and place the beam at the middle po-
sition, nc = 50. The maximum normalized propagation
distance used in our simulations is zmax = 45. Parame-
ter k in the ansatz (2) has the meaning of the transverse
steering velocity of the beam, in analogy with the contin-
uous approximation. It describes the value of an eﬀective
kick of the beam in the transversal direction at the input,
in order to achieve the beam motion and shift into one
of the neighboring (or other desired) waveguide outputs.
In our simulations, we control the numerical accuracy
by monitoring the two conserved quantities of model (1),

The input condition (2) does not correspond to an ex-

for k = 0 and, as the input kick (k
calized wave move to the right (k < 0) or left (k > 0),
its motion is accompanied by some radiation. The eﬀec-
tive lattice discreteness can be attributed to an eﬀective
periodic potential, the PN potential, which is dynamic
and changes in time. Due to both the strong radiation
and the presence of the PN barrier which should be over-
taken in order to move the beam transversally, the dis-
crete soliton gets trapped at one of the waveguides in the
array. In most of the cases, the shift of the beam posi-
tion to the neighboring waveguide is easy to achieve, as
shown in many studies [17]. However, the soliton switch-
ing becomes rather complicated and even chaotic. This
is shown on Fig. 2 where, for a ﬁxed value of the input
angle, a slight variation in the beam intensity results in
a erratic switching of the beam.

2. Modulated Arrays

In this paper, we suggest to modulate the coupling in
the waveguide arrays in order to achieve a controllable
output and to engineer the switching results. What this
modulation of the couplings does is to aﬀect the PN bar-
rier, providing us with a simple physical mechanism for
ﬁne tuning and control of the beam self-trapping.

To justify the validity of our concept, we perform a
qualitative estimate of the PN barrier in a framework
of the applicability of the discrete model and pertur-
bation theory. We study the case of strongly local-
ized modes [21] propagating in a homogeneous waveguide
array with identical coupling between the neighboring
waveguides, described by Eq. (1). We consider a general
localized mode that we want to propagate throughout the
array. Due to discreteness, our system lacks the transla-
tional invariance and, as a result, some of its energy must
be supplied in order to force the mode moving. Another
way to look at this problem is to consider that, because
of the lattice discreteness, the localized mode “sees” a

3

potential barrier (the PN barrier), whose height depends
on the eﬀective discreteness of the system as seen by the
excitation [21]. Thus, for wide modes, the barrier will be
smaller that for narrow modes. A rough estimate of this
PN barrier can be obtained by equating it to the diﬀer-
ence in the values of the Hamiltonian, between the mode
centered on a guide (odd mode) and the mode centered
between two neighboring guides (even mode) [21].

exp(

In order to evaluate a change of the PN barrier for the
mode initially kicked by an external force, we introduce
an initial phase tilt that is proportional to the factor

the eﬀective PN potential for an initially kicked localized
mode.

where u0 is the mode amplitude, k is a parameter of the
initial “kick” (an eﬀective transverse angle) applied to the
mode, λ1 is the longitudinal propagation constant, and
ǫ1 is a small parameter, to be determined from Eq. (1).
After substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (1) and keeping only
linear terms in ǫ1, we obtain

λ1 = 2ǫ1V cos(k) + γu2
0

and ǫ1 = V cos(k)/λ1, so that

where, as above, ˜u0 is the amplitude of the even mode,
k is the initial angle or eﬀective parameter of the initial
“kick”, λ2 is the longitudinal propagation constant of the
even mode, and ǫ2 is a small parameter. After substitut-
ing Eq. (7) into Eq. (1) and keeping only linear terms in
ǫ2, we obtain

λ2 = (1 + ǫ2) V cos(k) + γ ˜u2
0

and ǫ2 = V cos(k)/λ2, so that

¿From Eqs. (6) and (8) we obtain that, in order to have
strongly localized modes, the nonlinear contribution, rep-
0( or γ ˜u2
resented by the term γu2
0) must be much larger
than the linear term, represented by V cos(k). Now, for
calculating the PN barrier, we should relate the ampli-
tudes of the modes of two diﬀerent symmetries. One way

is to think of both the modes as diﬀerent states of a sin-
gle eﬀective mode shifted by a half lattice site along the
chain. This means that the power content of both modes

In comparison with the previously obtained result for
the PN barrier [21], Eq. (11) adds an extra, albeit small,
term that show how the PN barrier is modiﬁed for the
mode initially kicked in the lattice.
Indeed, besides
the ﬁrst term with dependent on the mode amplitude,
Eq. (11) has a linear term proportional to the factor
V cos(k), whose magnitude could be modiﬁed by a judi-
cious adjustment of the waveguide couplings and/or the
value of the initial kick.

Dependence of the PN barrier on the mode coupling
suggest that, if we wish to ﬁnd a way to engineer the
value of the PN barrier in the lattice, we should study the
properties of a modiﬁed model described by the evolution
equation

where the coupling Vn between two neighboring guides is
assumed to vary either through the eﬀective propagation
constant or by a change in the spacing between neighbor-
ing waveguides. To study the beam steering in this novel
model, we use again as an initial condition the sech-like
proﬁle (2), although this is not really fundamental limi-
tation, as argued below.

We mention that a variation of the waveguide coupling
in the array constitutes the starting point for our con-
cept of the waveguide array ’engineering’. A change of
the couplings breaks the symmetry between the beam mo-
tion to the right and left at the moment of trapping, thus
eliminating chaotic trapping observed in the case of ho-
mogeneous arrays.

We have tested diﬀerent types of modulation in the
array coupling and the corresponding structures of the
super-lattices. An example of one of such optimized
structure, where we modulate the coupling parameter Vn

markable contrast with other studies (see, e.g., Ref. [17]),
the coupling modulation allows to achieve a controllable
digitized switching of discrete optical solitons in the array
with very little or no distortion.

As is shown in Fig. 4, by decreasing the amplitude
of the input pulse at a ﬁxed value of the steering pa-
rameter k (in our example, ﬁxed to be k =
0.9), it is
possible to achieve self-trapping of the discrete soliton
by the lattice at some (short) distance from the input at
diﬀerent waveguide positions. Due to the step-like mod-
ulated coupling, we create a selection between the beam
motion to the right and left at the moment of trapping
thus suppressing or eliminating the chaotic trapping ob-
served in homogeneous waveguide arrays. In this way, we
achieve a controllable digitized nonlinear switching where
the continuous change of the amplitude of the input beam
results in a quantized displacement of the output beam
by an integer number of waveguides. Consequently, for

the parameters discussed above we observe almost undis-
torted switching up to eleven waveguides. Incidentally,
we notice here that the use of a linear ramp potential
(e.g. of the form Vn = an) for this purpose does not lead
to an eﬀective switching but, instead, it makes the soliton
switching even more chaotic due to the phenomenon of
Bloch oscillations which become randomized in the non-
linear regime.

In Fig. 5 we show another example of the optimized
coupling modulation, this time as a function of the ef-
fective input ‘kick’, for a ﬁxed beam intensity.
In this
case, we can achieve completely controlled switching up
to nine waveguides.

If the input beam was to excite initially ﬁve waveguides
instead of three, creating in this manner a wider excita-
tion (i.e., being closer to the continuum limit), one could
expect a smaller amount of radiation emitted. However,
this would imply a longer distance before the beam gets
trapped by one of the waveguides in the array due to
the eﬀective PN potential. Also, this means that one
could, in principle, switch the soliton beam to any de-
sired waveguide in the waveguide array, no matter how
far; it would be just a matter of choosing an initial beam
wide enough, i.e., closer to the continuum (in addition
to optimize the coupling in a step-wise manner), by re-
moving the random selection between the directions and
suppressing the beam random switching.

Another observation is that the sech-like initial proﬁle
is not really fundamental. We have veriﬁed the similar
dynamics for other types of the input beam proﬁles, in-
cluding a nonlinear impurity-like proﬁle of the form

un(0) = A

(13)

The reason for this universal behavior seems to rest on
the observation that, for any system with local nonlin-
earity, a narrow initial proﬁle, will render the system into

5

an eﬀective linear one containing a small nonlinear clus-
ter (or even a single site); the bound state will therefore
strongly resemble that corresponding to a nonlinear im-
purity [22].

B. Continuous model

In Sec. II A we have obtained exceedingly interesting
results for the switching of discrete solitons, v`ia the use
of the discrete model and tight-binding approximation.
In this section, in order to conﬁrm our predictions, we
perform the corresponding numerical simulations of the
continuous evolution equations of the electric ﬁeld in-
side a waveguide array, by means of the Beam Propa-
gation Method (BPM) [23]. As we show below, these
results support our major ﬁndings concerning the digi-
tized switching of an optical beam in engineered nonlin-
ear waveguide arrays.

In the continuous model, the starting point is an op-
tical beam propagating in a three-dimensional medium
with an index of refraction that varies in space and is
also intensity-dependent accounting for the Kerr eﬀect.
For a nonlinear waveguide array, the beam is assumed to
propagate along the z direction and to diﬀract or self-
focus along the transversal directions x and y. Assum-
ing that the beam envelope A(x, y, z) varies with z on a
scale much longer that the wavelength λ, the beam enve-
lope is found to obey [24] the three-dimensional nonlinear
Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation,

The waveguide structure creates a periodic modula-

directions (say, x). Along the other transversal direc-
tion y we assume the beam conﬁnement. Therefore, the
real dimensionality of the system is two (i.e., the lon-
gitudinal propagation and the transversal spreading or
self-trapping). We write the electric ﬁeld envelope in the
form A(x, y, z) = a(x, z)b(y) and use the eﬀective index

Figure 6 shows the switching of the beam as the ini-
tial input beam power is varied: Switching to three, ﬁve
and seven guides was observed for a power of 2750 W ,
2330 W and 2130 W , respectively. As expected from the
estimates of section II A 2, as power is decreased, so does
the PN Barrier, which allows the beam to get self-trapped
farther away from the vicinity of the input guide.

The above constitute a strong conﬁrmation of the ro-
bustness of the switching mechanism predicted by a sim-
ple theory, against more realistic eﬀects. Fine tuning of
the switching by an appropriate modulation of the eﬀec-
tive waveguide couplings, will allow a ﬁne control of the
position of the destination waveguide. However, this task
is beyond the main scope of the present paper.

III. QUADRATIC NONLINEAR WAVEGUIDES

Up to now we discussed the arrays of weakly coupled
waveguides with the cubic nonlinearity. However, during
last years a growing interest is observed in the study of
nonlinear optical eﬀects based on the so-called quadratic
nonlinearities.
In contrast to the conventional studies

of quadratic nonlinearities where the main attention is
centered primarily on parametric processes and the fre-
quency conversion, more recent works are focused on the
phase modulation of the fundamental as well as the sec-
ond harmonic waves [26]. This phase modulation ac-
companies the familiar amplitude modulation, being the
basis of any frequency conversion, and it may produce
the eﬀects which resemble those known to occur in cu-
bic nonlinear materials. Typical examples are all-optical
switching phenomena in interferometric or coupler con-
ﬁgurations as well as the formation of spatial and tem-
poral solitons in planar waveguides (for a comprehensive
overview, see Ref. [26] and the references therein).

Recently, it was demonstrated theoretically [27, 28, 29]
that arrays of quadratic nonlinear waveguides represent
a convenient system to verify experimentally many the-
oretical predictions done for the dynamics of nonlinear
latices with cubic nonlinearity. The ﬁrst experimental
observation of discrete quadratic solitons has been re-
cently reported by Stegeman and co-authors [19], who
demonstrated the formation of discrete quadratic soli-
tons in periodically poled Lithium Niobate waveguide
arrays, excited with fundamental wave pulses at a wave-
length of 1572 nm. These experimental observations open
many perspectives for employing much larger nonlinear-

we extend the concept of the controlled digitized soliton
switching discussed above to the case of quadratic dis-
crete solitons.

A. Discrete Model

The standard discrete model for an array of weakly
coupled quadratic nonlinear waveguides has the form [9]:

i

+ Va(an+1 + an−1) + 2γ2bna∗

dan
dz
+ Vb(bn+1 + bn−1) + βbn + γ2a2

n = 0

n = 0,

(16)

i

dbn
dz

where an and bn represent the amplitudes for the funda-
mental (ω) and second harmonic (2ω) ﬁelds on the n-th
guide, Va and Vb are the linear coupling parameters be-
tween the nearest neighbors waveguides. Parameter γ2
describes the nonlinear second-order coeﬃcient propor-
tional to the second-order dielectric susceptibility, and β
is the eﬀective mismatch between the ﬁelds in the array.
As in the case of the cubic nonlinearity, the system (16)

possesses two conserved quantities: The total power,

However, unlike the case of cubic nonlinear arrays
where it is possible to ﬁnd analytical solutions in the
continuum limit which can be used as input proﬁles for
numerical simulations of discrete solitons, in the case of
the quadratic nonlinearities no exact solutions are avail-
able. Thus, we will resort to the limit of strongly local-
ized modes (SLMs) in order to calculate the PN barrier
and use the SLM proﬁle as an input beam proﬁle for the
numerical computation of the switching properties.

From Eq. (20) and Eq. (22) it is easy to see that, in or-

be much larger than the linear coupling terms, Va cos(k)
and Vb cos(2k).

tures: The main term is cubic in the mode amplitude,
while for the cubic case it was quartic [see Eq. (11)].
Also we notice that the ﬁrst correction to the PN barrier
is linear in the couplings and depends on the square of the
SLM amplitude. This is exactly the same term as in the
case of the nonlinear cubic array. This implies that the
ﬁrst-order correction is more important in the nonlinear
quadratic array than that in the nonlinear cubic array
suggesting that the appropriate engineering of the cou-
plings and/or input ‘kick’ to achieve digitized switching
should be easier to achieve.

waveguides with the initial input centered at the middle,

plete phase-matching, i.e. β
0, and identical coupling
for both the harmonic ﬁelds, Va,n = Vb,n. Figure 7 shows
that the controlled digitized switching of the discrete two-
frequency (fundamental + second harmonic) soliton can
be achieved for up to 10 array sites, by varying the inten-
sity of the input fundamental mode for a ﬁxed parameter
1. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the coupling modu-
k =
lation required to achieve this type of engineered switch-
ing, which is particularly simple and consists of only a
single change of about 5% in the value of the coupling
parameter. Figure 8 demonstrates the switching of the
discrete mode, composed of the fundamental and second-
harmonic ﬁelds, to six, ﬁve, and four neighboring waveg-
uides, as the intensity of the input fundamental mode is
increased. In this respect, it is interesting to point out
that in all cases of the digital switching both the fun-
damental and second-harmonic ﬁelds acted as a strongly
coupled state, and that no ‘lagging behind’ was observed
of any of the modes with respect to the other.

We have performed other

simulations with the
quadratic array including the cases Vb = 0 (decoupled
second-harmonic ﬁelds in the array) and Vb = αVa (re-
duced coupling of the second-harmonic ﬁelds) with α < 1,
etc. In all of those cases, we have observed the digitized
switching of the discrete solitons by engineering the cou-
pling in the array as discussed above.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have suggested and demonstrated numerically a
simple but yet eﬀective method for controlling nonlinear
switching of discrete solitons in arrays of weakly cou-
pled optical waveguides. We have demonstrated how to
achieve the digitized switching of discrete optical solitons
in weakly coupled arrays of cubic and quadratic nonlin-

ear waveguides described, in the framework of the tight-
binding approximation, by discrete models such as the
DNLS equation with a step-like variation of the waveg-
uide coupling parameter. Our approach involves a weak
step-like modulation of the coupling strength (or, equiv-
alently, distance between the waveguides) in the arrays
with the period larger than the waveguide spacing. Such
kind of a super-lattice waveguide structure allows to mod-
ify the trapping properties of the array due to discrete-
ness as well as engineer the strength of the eﬀective
Peierls-Nabarro potential arising due to the lattice dis-
creteness. In particular, we have demonstrated the digi-
tized switching of a narrow input beam for up to eleven
waveguides, in the case of the cubic nonlinear array, and
up to ten waveguides, in the case of quadratic nonlinear

array. We have conﬁrmed our predictions for a full-scaled
continuous model and realistic parameters by employing
the beam propagation method.

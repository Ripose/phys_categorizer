We express the electromagnetic ﬁeld propagating in an arbitrary time-independent non-dispersive
medium in terms of an operator that turns out to be pseudo-Hermitian for Hermitian dielectric and
↔µ. We exploit this property to determine the propagating
magnetic permeability tensors
ﬁeld. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for a planar ﬁeld in an isotropic medium with
↔ε = ε
↔

of plane waves due to a localized inhomogeneity.

The study of electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds propagating
in a linear (non-dispersive) medium is one of the oldest
problems of physics. Most textbook treatments of this
problem begin with the assumption of harmonic time-
dependence. In this letter, we present a systematic solu-
tion of this problem that does not rely on this assump-
tion and instead makes use of the notion of “pseudo-
Hermitian operator” that was originally developed in
[1, 2] to deal with PT -symmetric Hamiltonians [3].

Consider the propagation of EM ﬁelds in a linear
source-free medium with time-independent dielectric and
↔ε (~x) and
inverse magnetic permeability tensors
↔′µ (~x), [4]. Then the electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
↔′µ =
~E and ~B, satisfy Maxwell’s equations:

~E0 := ~E(~x, 0) and ~B0 := ~B(~x, 0). We will consider loss-

We begin our study by expressing Eqs. (2) in terms
of ~E and ~B. Taking the time-derivative of the second
of these equations and using the result in the ﬁrst, we
obtain

In view of the ﬁrst equation in (2), the magnetic ﬁeld is
given by ~B(~x, t) = ~B0(~x) −

0 ds D ~E(~x, s), [13].

Relation (4) is of limited practical importance, because
R
in general its right-hand side involves inﬁnite deriva-
tive expansions. We can choose the initial ﬁelds such
that they are eliminated by a positive integer power of
Ω2. This leads to an inﬁnite class of exact solutions of
Maxwell’s equations with polynomial time-dependence.
In order to use (4) in dealing with physically more inter-
esting situations, we will express (5) and (6) as integral
operators and compute the corresponding integral kernels
(propagators). This requires a closer look at the operator
Ω2.

ˆj are the unit vectors along the x- and y-axes, and ε(z)
and µ(z) are respectively (the z-dependent) dielectric and
magnetic permeability constants. We will in particular
consider the cases that ε(z) and µ(z) tend to constant
values as z → ±∞.

For this conﬁguration all the ﬁelds are independent of
x and y-coordinates and we have Ω2 = ε(z)−1p µ(z)−1p,

(cid:19)

Because of the above-mentioned asymptotic behavior of
ε(z) and µ(z), the eigenfunctions of h are the solutions of
(11) fulﬁlling the bounded boundary conditions at ±∞.
Also note that ω2 ∈ R+, because h is a positive operator.
For an arbitrary ε we cannot solve (11) exactly. There-
fore, we employ the WKB approximation. To do this we
express ψ in its polar representation: ψ = R eiS where
R and S are real-valued functions. Inserting ψ = R eiS
in (11) gives

Σ(z, w; t) := sign[u(w) − u(z) + t] − sign[u(w) − u(z) − t].
Because u is a monotonically increasing function that
vanishes only at z = 0, it is invertible and its inverse u−1
is also a monotonically increasing function with a single
zero at z = 0. This implies that the quantity

w±(z, t) := u−1(u(z) ± t)

(22)

is the only zero of u(w) − (u(z) ± t). Hence, δ[u(w) −
u(z) ± t] = δ[w − w∓(z, t)]/|u′(w∓(z, t))|. In view of this
relation and (16), we have

∆(z, w; t) =

δ[w − w−(z, t)]
v(w−(z, t))−1 +

δ[w − w+(z, t)]
v(w+(z, t))−1 .

(23)

Furthermore, because both u and u−1 are monotonically
increasing, for t > 0 we have w−(z, t) < w+(z, t) and

Σ(z, w; t) =

for w−(z, t) < w < w+(z, t),

In vacuum where v = (εµ)−1/2 = c and WKB approxima-
tion is exact, (27) coincides with D’Alembert’s solution
of the 1+1 dimensional wave equation [9].

In general, (27) is a valid solution of Maxwell’s equa-
tions, if WKB approximation is reliable. This is the case
whenever |Q(z)| is negligibly smaller than the right-hand
side of (12), [15]. In view of (15) and (16) this condition
takes the form

(28)

where we have suppressed the z dependence of v and µ.
Due to the asymptotic behavior of µ and ε, v tends to
constant values as z → ±∞. This in turn implies that the
square root of the left-hand side of (28) has a least upper
bound that we denote by ωmin. In this case, (28) means
|ω| ≫ ωmin. Recalling the role of ω in our derivation
of (27), we can view this condition as a restriction on
the choice of the initial conditions. More speciﬁcally,
(27) is a good approximation provided that for all ω ∈

0. For a planar laser pulse with initial envelope functions
E0 and B0 picked far away from the region where ε and
µ vary signiﬁcantly, these conditions hold for c−1ωmin ≪
|k0|. The same is true for an initial plane wave with
suﬃciently large wave number |k0|.

a < 1, ωmin < cγ−1. This means that WKB approxima-
p
tion and consequently (27) are valid provided that the
allowed ω values be much larger than cγ−1.

In order to implement (27), we must compute w±. This
involves the evaluation and inversion of u. For the choice
(29), we expand u and u−1 in power series in the inho-
mogeneity parameter a and perform a perturbative cal-
culation of w±. This yields

use (27) to determine the dynamical behavior of the EM
ﬁelds for initial conﬁgurations of the form (9) provided
that the initial ﬁelds do not violate the condition of the
reliability of the WKB approximation and that we can
neglect the third and higher order contributions in pow-
ers of a. For example we can use this method to deter-
mine the eﬀect of the inhomogeneity (29) on the planar
propagation of a Gaussian laser pulse [16].

Another application of our results is in the solution of
the scattering problem. It is not diﬃcult to see that for

To summarize, we have obtained a closed form expres-
sion (4) for the propagation of EM ﬁelds in an arbitrary
non-dispersive stationary medium that yields the ﬁelds in
terms of a pseudo-Hermiticity operator Ω2. This allows
for formulating the problem in terms of an equivalent
Hermitian operator h. Using the spectral resolution of h
and the WKB approximation we have found an explicit
formula for the propagating ﬁelds and demonstrated its
application for the scattering of plane waves moving in an
inhomogeneous non-dispersive medium. Although simi-
lar spectral techniques have previously been used in deal-
ing with EM waves [10], we believe that our treatment
provides a more straightforward and systematic solution
for this problem with a wide range of applications, e.g.,
to study wave propagation in inhomogeneous ﬁbers, ob-
servation of superﬂuid vortices, etc.

Our results may be generalized in various directions.
↔ε fails to be Hermitian,
For example, for the cases that
one may appeal to the notion of weak pseudo-Hermiticity
[11] and use the results of [12] to obtain an appropriate
equivalent Hermitian operator h to Ω2. One may also
↔′µ
incorporate the dispersion eﬀects by letting the
that appear in the eigenvalue equation for h to depend

[16] We have studied a pulse with E0(z) = A e− (z+L)2

B0(z) = 0, A, L, σ ∈ R+, L ≫ γ, and L ≫ σ. Then
the WKB approximation is valid whenever γ−1 ≪ k0.
We do not report the results here for lack of space.

detect the eﬀect of the inhomogeneity in the interference
pattern of two beams one travelling through the medium
and the other through the vacuum.

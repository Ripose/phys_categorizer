Recently the investigation of the extremely short (subpicosecond) X-ray pulses inter-

action with crystals takes interest because of the development of linac-driven X-ray Free

Electron Laser, operating in the SASE mode and X-ray Volume Free Electron Laser [1, 2].

According to the analysis [3] short X-ray pulse passing through a crystal is accompanied

by the signiﬁcant time delay of radiation. The δ

pulse delay law for the Bragg diﬀraction

In the present paper the delay law dependence on the diﬀraction asymmetry param-

eters is analyzed. It is shown that the use of subpicosecond pulses allows to observe the

phenomenon of the time delay of pulse in crystal and to investigate the delay law experi-

mentally. It is also shown that the pulse delay law depends on the quanta polarization.

Let us consider the pulse of electromagnetic radiation passing through the medium with

the refraction index n(ω). The wave packet group velocity is as follows:

c
n(ω) + ω ∂n(ω)
∂ω
where c - is the speed of light, ω - is the quantum frequency.

Substituting n(ω) to (1) one can obtain that vgr ≃

describe pulse passing through a crystal. Maxwell equations are linear, therefore it is

convenient to use Fourier transform by time and to rewrite these equations as functions of

frequency:

where χij(~r, ω) - is the spatially periodic tensor of susceptibility, i, j = 1, 2, 3, repeated

indices imply summation.

Making the Fourier transformation of these equations by coordinate variables one can

derive a set of equations matching the incident and diﬀracted waves. When two strong

waves are excited under diﬀraction (so-called two-beam diﬀraction case) the following set

of equations for wave amplitudes determining can be obtained:

Here ~k is the wave vector of the incident wave, ~k~τ = ~k +~τ , ~τ is the reciprocal lattice vector;

It is possible

to discriminate several types of diﬀraction geometries, namely, the Laue and the Bragg

schemes are the most well-known [4].

The diﬀraction is signiﬁcant in the narrow range near the Bragg frequency, therefore

χ0 and χτ can be considered as constants and the dependence on ω should be taken into

can become equal to zero (Bragg reﬂection threshold) and vgr →
that in the presence of the time-alternative external ﬁeld a crystal can be described by the

eﬀective indices of refraction that depend on the external ﬁeld frequency Ω . Therefore, in

this case vgr appears to be the function of Ω . This can be easily observed in the conditions

of X-ray-acoustic resonance. The analysis done allows to conclude that center of the X-

ray pulse can undergo the signiﬁcant delay in a crystal ∆T

Let us study now the time dependence of delay law of radiation after passing through

a crystal. Assuming that B(ω) is the reﬂection or transmission amplitude coeﬃcients of a

crystal one can obtain the following expression for the pulse form

Since χ0 and χτ are complex, both as and ∆ωB have real and imaginary parts. Accord-

ing to (12-14) in the case of Bragg reﬂection of short pulse (pulse frequency band width

≫
frequency width of the total reﬂection range) appear both the instantly reﬂected pulse and

the pulse with amplitude undergoing damping beatings. Beatings period increases with

grows and χτ decrease. Pulse intensity can be written as

It is evident that the reﬂected pulse intensity depends on the orientation of photon

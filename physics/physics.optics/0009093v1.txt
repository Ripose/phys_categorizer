Abstract

We review the theory of light propagation in moving media with
extremely low group velocity. We intend to clarify the most elemen-
tary features of monochromatic slow light in a moving medium and,
whenever possible, to give an instructive simpliﬁed picture.

1 Introduction

Waves experience moving media as eﬀective gravitational ﬁelds. To under-
stand why, imagine a deﬁnite example — light traveling in a moving trans-
parent ﬂuid such as ﬂowing water [1, 2].
In each drop of the liquid, light
propagates along a straight line and so each drop distinguishes a particular
inertial frame. Now imagine light passing from one drop to a next one which
happens to move with a diﬀerent velocity vector. Again, the new drop in the
way of the light distinguishes an inertial frame, but this new frame will diﬀer
from the previous one. Light traveling in a non–uniformly moving medium
is constantly forced to adapt to new inertial frames. An analogous situation
occurs in curved space–time when light, and all other matter, experiences
space and time as consisting of connected inertial frames. Space–time can be
thought as being locally ﬂat, even in the vicinity of the most violent gravitat-
ing objects, yet each local frame is non-trivially connected to the neighboring
frames, a connection mathematically described in terms of the curvature ten-
sor [3]. In a moving medium, the local co-moving frames of the medium play
the role of the local pieces of ﬂat space–time. Because theses pieces diﬀer
in non–uniform ﬂows, light propagation in a moving medium resembles light
propagation in curved space–time, i.e. the medium appears to light as an
eﬀective gravitational ﬁeld [4]-[6].

One could conceive of employing moving media for creating artiﬁcial as-
tronomical objects in the laboratory. For example, water going down the
drain of a bathtub appears to light as a rotating black hole. However, in
order to observe spectacular eﬀects of general relativity in laboratory–based
analogues, truly astronomical ﬂow velocities are required. For establishing
a black hole, the ﬂuid should move faster than the speed of light in the
medium (c divided by the refractive index n). The chances of creating anala-
goes of black holes are much better when one employs sound instead of light
in appropriate supersonic ﬂows [7]-[16]. One of the most fascinating eﬀects
of black holes is Hawking radiation [17]-[19], the spontaneous generation of
photon pairs near the hole’s horizon where one of the photons falls into the
hole and the other tunnels out of the attraction zone and become visible. The
acoustical equivalent of Hawking radiation is quantum sound in superﬂuids
[7]-[16]. However, superﬂuidity tends to break down before the ﬂuid has a
chance to move faster than the speed of sound [20]. Furthermore, quantum
sound and ﬂow are just two aspects of the same object, the quantum liquid.

2

The ﬂow is the macroscopic and the sound the microscopic motion. Under
extreme circumstances such as near the horizon of a sonic black hole, a clear
distinction between sound and ﬂow might be diﬃcult. An advantage of light
in a moving medium is the clear separation between wave and ﬂow, and both
light and medium can be regarded as separate quantum systems.

Recently, light has been slowed down dramatically [21]-[23] due to an ef-
fect called Electromagnetically Induced Transparency [24]-[26]. The use of
slow light could open the opportunity for observing the radiation of quantum–
optical black holes. Note, however, that slow light is a more complicated
phenomenon than light in a moving non–dispersive dielectric where the re-
fractive index does not depend on the frequency of light. Slow light is based
on a highly dispersive medium created by dressing the atoms of the medium
with an appropriate light beam. Instead of the phase velocity only the group
velocity is reduced. Therefore, it is not always advisable to conclude directly
from the behavior of light in ordinary dielectrics to the motional eﬀects of
slow–light media. It is the purpose of these notes to clarify the most elemen-
tary features of slow light in a moving medium [27] and, whenever possible,
to give an instructive simpliﬁed picture.

2 Dispersion relation

Imagine the medium as being decomposed into drops. Each drop should be
small enough such that the ﬂow does not vary signiﬁcantly within the size of
the drop, but each drop should be suﬃciently large to sustain several optical
oscillations. We thus assume that the wave length of light is much shorter
than the typical scale of changes in the ﬂow. In this case, we can describe
light by a dispersion relation in the local co–moving frame of each medium
drop denoted with primes

k′2 −

ω′2
c2 − χ(ω′)

ω′2
c2 = 0 .

(1)

The susceptibility χ(ω′) characterizes the medium. In Electromagnetically
Induced Transparency [24]-[26] a coupling beam dresses the upper two levels
of a three–level atom shown schematically in Fig. 1. The dressing of the
upper two levels inﬂuences strongly the propagation of the probe light with
a frequency that should match the atomic transition frequency ω0 between

induced transparency. A strong drive laser ﬁeld couples the levels a and

transition a↔b.

the lower and one of the upper levels. Exactly on resonance, the medium
decouples from the probe light and becomes transparent, whereas ordinary
dielectrics are extremely absorbing at atom–light resonances. Furthermore,
the susceptibility changes rapidly, see Fig. 2, and, near the resonance, χ(ω′)
assumes a linear dependence on the detuning between the light frequency ω′
and the atomic frequency ω0,

χ(ω′) =

2c
ω0vg

(ω′ − ω0) ,

(2)

giving rise to a very low group velocity vg. If the slow–light medium is moving
coherently, the motion will slightly detune each atom from exact resonance
due to the Doppler eﬀect.

Imagine that the ﬂow of the medium, u, varies only in two dimensions
and that the coupling beam propagates orthogonally to the ﬂow, see Fig
3. In this case we can ignore the ﬁrst–order Doppler eﬀect of the coupling
beam and we should focus only on the Doppler detuning of the probe. In the
laboratory frame the probe shall be monochromatic at the atomic frequency
ω0. In the co–moving local frames of the medium the probe–light frequency

to ﬁrst order in u/c. Let us transform the dispersion relation (1) to the
laboratory frame. We take advantage of the Lorentz invariance of k2−(ω/c)2
and obtain to ﬁrst order in u/c the relation

In Ref. [27] a more complicated dispersion relation has been derived which is
correct up to second order in u/c. Note that the relation (4) describes eﬀects
in leading order of u/(vgc)1/2, because the second–order corrections of Ref.
[27] are proportional to v−1
g .

to the coupling beam (grey arrow). This beam prepares the medium such
that the group velocity of light is signiﬁcantly reduced. The probe beam
(lines) experiences the Doppler detuning due to the moving medium and
becomes deﬂected or even trapped.

3 Magnetic model and metric

We are going to use the simpliﬁed relation (4) to illuminate the most char-
acteristic features of slow light in moving media. First we note that we can
write the relation as

Monochromatic light waves with ﬁxed polarization thus obey the wave equa-
tion

 −i∇ + k0

φ − k2

(7)

The ﬂow has a two–fold eﬀect: On one hand, the velocity u appears as an
eﬀective vector potential, for example the magnetic vector potential acting
on an electron wave [28], and, on the other hand, the hydrodynamic pressure
proportional to u2 [29] acts as a scalar potential. This resembles the R¨ontgen
eﬀect of static electromagnetic ﬁelds on polarizable atoms [30, 31].

Alternatively, we can regard the ﬂow as generating an eﬀective gravita-

tional ﬁeld. To see this, we introduce the four–dimensional wave vector

kν = (k0,−k) ,

(8)

and, adopting Einstein’s summation convention, write the dispersion relation
(4) as

with the contravariant metric tensor

gµνkµkν = 0

gµν =   1

u/vg

u/vg −1 ! .

(9)

(10)

Four–dimensional wave vectors are null vectors with respect to the eﬀective
metric gµν and, in turn [1], light rays follow zero-geodesics with respect to
the line element

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν

,

dxν = (ct, x) .

(11)

7

The covariant metric tensor gµν is the inverse of the contravariant one, and
is given by

1

gµν =

1 + u2/v2

u/vg

g   1

u/vg −1 ! .

(12)

In contrast to sound [14] or light in non–dispersive media [1], a genuine
event horizon of slow light cannot exist at this level of approximation. The
potential existence of an event horizon is thus conﬁned to eﬀects to second
order in u/(vgc)1/2which are excluded from our simpliﬁed model [32].

4 Non–relativistic analogue

To get more insight into the behavior of slow light in moving media, let us
study another analogue. Consider a non–relativistic free particle attached to
moving frames. The particle is supposed to move freely in each of the local
frames but is bound to adapt from one frame to the next, similar to light
in drops of ﬂowing water. However we use pure non–relativistic physics to
transform from frame to frame. In case the local frames constitute a global
frame, for example a rotating solid body, the particle would move along a
straight line with respect to this frame. In the laboratory frame, the parti-
cle’s trajectory appears to be bent, attributed to the eﬀect of Coriolis and
centrifugal forces. The Lagrange function of such a ﬁctitious non–relativistic
particle is

L =

v′2 =

1
2

1
2

(v − w)2 ,

(13)

up to a constant mass factor that we can set to unity, because we are inter-
ested in inertial eﬀects only. The velocity of the local intertial frames is w
and we have used the non–relativistic addition theorem of velocities

v′ = v − w .

(14)

Note that we could apply Einstein’s relativistic addition theorem of velocities
to describe light in moving non–dispersive media of refractive index n, but we
should use an eﬀective speed of light of c/n in the theorem. The momentum
of the ﬁctitious non–relativistic particle is

∂L
∂v

p ≡

= v − w

8

(15)

and the Hamiltonian is

H ≡ v · p − L =

1
2

p2 − w · p = E .

(16)

The important point is that we can translate the Hamiltonian (16) into the
dispersion relation (4) by setting

p = c

k
k0

, w =

c
vg

u , E =

c2 .

(17)

with the enhanced eﬀective frame velocity w [33]. Consequently, slow light
experiences the moving medium in the same way as a non–relativistic particle
experiences moving inertial frames. Excused by its ﬁctitious nature, the
“non–relativistic” particle would move at an extraordinary speed reaching c
in regions where the medium is at rest, because the energy is

c2 = E = H =

We obtain from Hamilton’s equations,

5 Light rays around a vortex

Consider a speciﬁc example of a non–uniform ﬂow, a vortex. Quantum vor-
tices in alkali Bose–Einstein condensates have been recently made [34, 35].
They give rise to intriguing slow-light phenomena. However, vortices do not
posses genuine event horizons [32] and they will not radiate spontaneously.
The ﬂow of an ideal vortex of vorticity W is
eϕ = i W

u = W

written in polar coordinates or using the complex notation z = x + iy, z∗ =
x − iy of the planar Cartesian coordinates x, y. The curl of the vortex ﬂow
vanishes,
(22)

∇ × u = 0 ,

and hence we obtain the equation of motion of a particle in an attractive r−2
potential [36]-[38],

or, in complex notation,

(23)

(24)

The trajectories of the fall into a r−2 singularity are well known in polar
coordinates [36] but here we suggest a more elegant description using the
complex notation of the planar Cartesian coordinates,

z =  −ct + i

with the real parameter b and

µ =  1 − W 2

(25)

(26)

One can easily verify that this solution satisﬁes the equation of motion (24).
In the inﬁnite past, t → −∞, the trajectories approach

z ∼ −ct + ib .

(27)

From this asymptotics we see that the light is incident from the right to the
left with initial velocity c and impact parameter b. Depending on the impact
parameter, the coeﬃcient µ is real or purely imaginary. In the case of a real
g b2 the incident light particle will be able to escape, because
µ when W 2 < v2
the modulus squared of z, c2t2 + b2/µ2, will never reach zero, the vortex core.
In the inﬁnite future, t → +∞, the particle will approach

z ∼ ct (−1)µ + ib = cteiπµ + ib

and, consequently, leaves at the angle πµ. In the case of a purely imaginary
gb2 the light is sucked into the vortex, because the
coeﬃcient µ when W 2 > v2
modulus squared of z, c2t2 + b2/µ2, reaches zero at the time t = −|b/(µc)|. In
practice, the light will hit the vortex core and will bounce back. In theory, the

Fig. 4.

Light waves around a vortex

Near the vortex core, rays of slow light feel the presence of the centrifugal
r−2 attraction but no Coriolis force, because the curl of the ﬂow vanishes.

11

Light waves, however, will show a distinctive interference pattern, an optical
Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect [39]-[42] due to the long–range nature of a vortex ﬂow.
Far outside the vortex core, light rays are hardly deﬂected, yet rays passing
the vortex in ﬂow direction will be dragged and those swimming against the
current lag behind. This does not aﬀect the ray trajectories but it produces
a phase shift between the dragged and the lagging rays, and, in turn, creates
a typical interference pattern [41, 42]. Note that the Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect
of waves in moving media is not restricted to light.
Indeed, Berry et al.
[43] have reported and analyzed a beautiful bathtub experiment with water
waves in a tank, visualizing clearly the interference structure generated by
the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect. A further experiment has been reported [44]
showing spiral waves. Acoustical analogues of the eﬀect have been observed
in moving classical media [45] and are predicted for superﬂuids [46]. The
acoustical eﬀect might even lead to a friction felt by traveling vortices due to
the so-called Iordanskii force [47]-[49]. The optical Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect of
slow light [27] can be applied to observe in situ the ﬂow of quantum vortices
in alkali Bose–Einstein condensates [34, 35] using phase–contrast imaging
[50].

Consider the propagation of slow–light waves through a vortex ﬂow. In

(31)

We could simply eliminate the optical analogue of the vector potential by
representing φ as

φ = φ0 exp(−iνABϕ)

(32)

where φ0 feels only the local r−2 attraction due to the centrifugal force. The
modulation exp(−iνABϕ) describes the long–range Aharonov–Bohm phase
pattern [41]. Strictly speaking, however, the ansatz (32) is only justiﬁed when
the function exp(−iνABϕ) is single–valued after a complete cycle of ϕ, i.e.
when νAB is an integer. For non–integer ﬂux quanta the interference pattern

12

is slightly more complicated, showing, most prominently, a line of zeros of the
wave function after passing the vortex (which resolves the problem of a multi–
valued phase, because a phase is not deﬁned when the amplitude is zero).
Even in the case of non–integer optical ﬂux quanta νAB, the modulation
exp(−iνABϕ) accounts for the dominant phase pattern.

(35)

Figure 5 shows plots of slow–light waves around a vortex to illustrate the
long–range phase shift brought about by the optical Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect.

Close to the vortex core, a light ray is doomed to fall into the singularity
g. In

when the square of the impact parameters, b2, does not exceed W 2/v2
this case the angular momentum m lies in the interval

because, according to Eqs. (15,17) and the pattern (21) of the vortex ﬂow,

− 2νAB ≤ m ≤ 0 ,

(36)

r × k = r × k0(v − w)/c = (k0b − νAB) ez .

(37)

The fall of light rays into the vortex core corresponds to a drastic change
of the behavior of the corresponding partial waves φm. In the case (36) the
index (35) of the Bessel function in a radial wave (34) is purely imaginary.
Using the ﬁrst term in the power–series expansion of the Bessel functions
[51] we see that um is rapidly oscillating near the core,

as we see from the asymptotics of the Bessel functions [51]. For a negative
imaginary ν the second term in Eq. (39) dominates and so most of the light
is incident, yet a small fraction with weight exp(−2iπν) is able to tunnel out
of the attraction zone.
Where is the borderline between pure inﬂux and partial tunneling out of
the attraction zone? Consider the geometrical optics of a radial wave. We
make the eikonal ansatz

Quite typically, valuable insight into the behavior of waves can be gained
by analytical continuation to the complex plane of the wave’s argument.
Consider the line in the complex plane of the radius r where the eikonal is
purely imaginary, i.e. where

Re "qρ2 + 1 − arsinh  1

ρ!# = 0 ,

(42)

see Fig. 6. This line is called a Stokes line [52, 53]. When passing a Stokes
line, one component of the superposition (40) becomes exponentially small
and hence irrelevant [52]. The asymptotics in the limit of geometrical optics
switches from a two–component regime, for example in–and–out ﬂux, to a
single component behavior, such as pure inﬂux [52]. The Stokes line in Fig.
6 thus marks the boundary where light is able to tunnel out of the optical
black hole.

6 Summary

We analyzed the propagation of slow light in moving media in the case when
the light is monochromatic in the laboratory frame. Slow light is generated
by the electromagnetically induced transparency of an atomic transition.
The Doppler detuning due to the moving medium generates ﬂow-dependent
eﬀects. We considered analogies to magnetism and general relativity and
studied light propagation around a vortex in some detail. The subject is far
from being exhausted — light detuned from the atomic resonance and non–
monochromatic light will behave diﬀerently, opening perhaps new exciting
analogies and opportunities for laboratory tests of astronomical eﬀects on
Earth.

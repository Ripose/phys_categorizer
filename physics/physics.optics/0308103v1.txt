Abstract

In recent years there has been an explosive development of interest in
the measurement of forces at the microscopic level, such as within living
cells [1, 2, 3], as well as the properties of ﬂuids and suspensions on this
scale [4], using optically trapped particles as probes. The next step would
be to measure torques and associated rotational motion [5]. This would
allow measurement on very small scales since no translational motion
is needed. It could also provide an absolute measurement of the forces
holding a stationary non-rotating particle in place. The laser-induced
torque acting on an optically trapped microscopic birefringent particle
[6] can be used for these measurements. Here we present a new method
for simple, robust, accurate, simultaneous measurement of the rotation
speed of a laser trapped birefringent particle, and the optical torque acting
on it, by measuring the change in angular momentum of the light from
passing through the particle. This method does not depend on the size
or shape of the particle or the laser beam geometry, nor does it depend
on the properties of the surrounding medium. This could allow accurate
measurement of viscosity on a microscopic scale.

Introduction

Optical torques have been measured previously; two methods have been used.
if a particle with known birefringent properties has a simple and
Firstly,
accurately known size and shape, ideally a ﬂat disc, the torque can be calculated
from the beam power [6]. However, particles of more complex shapes will
often be used in experiments or encountered in samples; for example, spherical
particles are ideal for making measurements of viscosity. Secondly, torques
have been determined by measuring the rotation speed in a medium of known
viscosity [6, 7]. This method cannot be used if the aim is to measure an unknown
viscosity. This method would also fail if there were other torques acting on the
particle, or if the viscous drag is aﬀected by nearby walls or other particles,
or if the particle is not rotating. Previous methods for measuring rotation
speeds, based on the periodic variation of backscattered light [8], can also have
problems. Very regular or rotationally symmetric particles provide insuﬃcient

variation or variation at an increased frequency. Consideration of the basic
physical processes giving rise to the torque gives a new method for measuring
the torque and rotation speed that overcomes all of these problems.

Since optical torques and forces are very small, microscopic particles are
ideal for the observation and application of optical torques and rotation. Such
microscopic particles will typically be conﬁned within a laser trap. Strongly
focussed laser light incident on a transparent particle, usually in a liquid
medium, will produce a gradient force acting on the particle towards the region
If this gradient force near the focus is stronger than

scattering and absorption forces, the particle will be trapped at the beam
focus, where the irradiance is highest. This technique of three-dimensional
conﬁnement and manipulation is called laser micro-manipulation, trapping, or
optical tweezers.

2 Polarised beams

A monochromatic laser beam can be written as a plane wave in terms of two
orthogonal components:

E = (Ex ˆx + Ey ˆy) exp(ikz

iωt)

−

where the beam is propagating in the z-direction. In general, the amplitudes
Ex and Ey are complex in order to account for the phases of the components.
There are two cases of special interest. The ﬁrst is when the phase angle
between the complex amplitudes Ex and Ey is equal to 0 or π, in which case
the total electric ﬁeld always lies in a single plane resulting in a beam which is
linearly polarised. The direction of the x-axis can be chosen to coincide with
the plane of polarisation, so the beam can be written as

E = Ep ˆx exp(ikz

iωt)

−

The second special case is when the phase angle is

where Ep is the complex amplitude of the linearly polarised light
.

π/2, and
|
In this case, Ey = Ex exp iθ, with θ =
π/2. The total electric ﬁeld has a
constant magnitude, with the direction varying with the optical frequency ω so
that the beam is circularly polarised. When θ = +π/2, the electric ﬁeld has
a positive, or right-handed, helicity. Such a beam is here called left circularly
polarised. When θ =
π/2, the beam has negative helicity and is called right
circularly polarised. A circularly polarised beam can always be written as

with the sign depending on whether the beam is left or right circularly polarised,
and Ec is the complex amplitude.

In general, however, the phase angle θ will have a value between these
limiting values, or even if θ =
. In these cases, the beam is

components using the (complex) orthogonal basis vectors

Although we have only considered the beam as a classical EM wave so far, the
fact that the angular momentum of left and right circularly polarised photons
is

When the irradiance is integrated across the whole beam, the total power
can be obtained and will be given by P = PL + PR = R ILdA + R IRdA. A
suitable average coeﬃcient of circular polarisation can be deﬁned by
σz = (PL −

(13)

with the resulting total angular momentum ﬂux of the beam being

Lz = σzP/ω.

3 Optical torque

If the beam passes through some birefringent material, the polarisation will be
aﬀected.
In general, σz will change. The incident beam will have an initial
coeﬃcient of circular polarisation σzin, and will have an emergent polarisation
described by σzout. Thus the angular momentum of the beam will change, and
a reaction torque on the birefringent material will result. The reaction torque
is equal to the change in the angular momentum ﬂux:

τ = (σzin −

σzout)P/ω

(15)

assuming that absorption and reﬂection can be ignored. Equation (15) is
general, and can always be used to ﬁnd the torque if the coeﬃcients of circular
polarisation of the incident and outgoing beams are known or can be found.

Although equation (15) applies in general, it is instructive to carry through
a detailed calculation for a simple case: a uniform sheet of birefringent material,
for example calcite.

A uniaxial birefringent material such as calcite can be described by two
refractive indices: an ordinary refractive index no for electric ﬁelds normal to
the optic axis, and an extraordinary refractive index ne for electric ﬁelds parallel
to the optic axis. For calcite, no = 1.66 and ne = 1.49. Consider a thickness d
of uniaxial birefringent material with the optic axis in the xy plane, at an angle
of θ to the x-axis. The front face of the material is at z = z0, and the rear face
is at z = z0 + d. If the electric ﬁeld of the incident beam at the front surface
of the material is given by equation (1), we can express this in terms of unit
vectors ˆi and ˆj parallel to and normal to the optic axis:

E = [(Ex cos θ + Ey sin θ)ˆi + (

which is independent of the orientation of the birefringent material.

If the birefringent material is of a uniform thickness, the total torque can
be simply calculated from this [6].
In general, a laser trapped birefringent
particle will have a varying thickness, and direct calculation of the torque will
not be feasible. Also, if the orientation of the birefringent particle is diﬀerent,
so the the optic axis does not lie in the xy plane, the calculation will be further
complicated. Equation (15), however, is general, and will still apply, and the
torque acting on the particle can be deduced from the change in polarisation of
the light.

4 Optical torque measurement

Consider a circularly polarised laser beam used to trap a microscopic particle
composed of a uniaxial birefringent material such as calcite or a suitable
polymer. If the optical torque is large enough to overcome forces holding the
particle in place, the particle will rotate at a speed determined by the equilibrium
between the optical torque and other forces such as viscous drag. In this way,
a probe particle can be used to measure viscosity on a microscopic scale. If the
particle does not rotate, the optical torque can be used to determine the torque
due to static forces acting on the particle.

Nieminen et al. Optical measurement of microscopic torques

The maximum torque and rotation rate will occur when the incident beam
is completely circularly polarised (ie σzin = 1). The torque in this case will also
be constant as well as maximal [6], and we will only consider this case here.
The torque τ acting on the trapped particle is given in equation (15) by the
diﬀerence between the incident and outgoing angular momentum ﬂuxes, and in
this case, assuming no reﬂection or absorption, is

τ = (1

σzout)P/ω.

−

(26)

Measurement of the outgoing polarisation σzout and beam power P gives an
absolute measurement of the torque, which does not depend on the mechanical
properties of the surrounding medium or the particular size or shape of the
particle or laser beam.

We can also note that the plane of polarisation of the linearly polarised
component of the outgoing beam exiting a rotating birefringent particle will be
rotating at the same rotation rate Ω as the particle. If the outgoing beam is a
(rotating) purely plane-polarised beam, as would occur if the particle acted as
a quarter-wave plate, rotating at Ω, and of power P , and is passed through a
linear polariser, the measured power Pm will be Pm = (1 + cos 2Ωt)P/2 (with
variation at a frequency of 2Ω since a rotation of 180◦ rotates the plane of
polarisation onto itself) [10]. By measuring this power, the rotation rate Ω of
the trapped particle can be simply determined. This will still be the case for an
elliptically polarised beam, as the same variation at a frequency of 2Ω will be
observed. The angular momentum associated with this rotation of the plane of
ω.
polarisation will be negligible as Ω

In the general case, there will be an elliptically polarised outgoing beam,
consisting of both plane and circularly polarised components. The measured
power Pm after the outgoing beam passes through a linear polariser acting as
an analyser will be

≪

Pm =

1 + (1

{

P/2.

}

(27)

Measurement of the variation of the transmitted power therefore allows the
determination of the rotation period of the trapped particle, and the degree of
(but not the direction of) circular polarisation. The result of a measurement of
this type will be as shown in ﬁgure 1. This measurement is an average over the
beam, and it is not important whether or not the entire beam passes through the
particle. In the case where the particle is not rotating, due to some restraining
torque, the plane of polarisation of the transmitted light will not be rotating.
The degree of circular polarisation can be measured in this case by rotating the
linear polariser, which will give the same result where Ω is the rotation rate of
the polariser relative to the particle. The orientation of the particle can also be
determined from the position of the measured power maxima.

In many cases, the direction of the transmitted polarisation will be known
beforehand—such as when the particle is insuﬃciently thick to change the
direction of polarisation (note that a calcite particle approximately 3µm thick
is a λ/2 plate for 1064 nm light), or when the particle is small and the outgoing
light is dominated by light that did not pass through the particle and has not
changed in polarisation. If necessary, the direction of circular polarisation can
be measured simply by placing a reversed circular polariser (eg a quarter-wave
plate followed by a linear polariser appropriately oriented) in the beam path

mean power measured through the polariser is half of the power incident on the
particle. The frequency of the variation is two times the rotation rate Ω of the
particle. The optical torque can be found from the amplitude of the variation
and the measured power once the direction of the transmitted polarisation is
known. In this case, for a 100 mW trapping beam of wavelength 1,064 nm, an

handed helicity (left circularly polarised, with σzin = +1), the light emergent
from the particle can be described in terms of left and right circularly polarised
components PL and PR, where PL = (1 + σzout)P/2 and PR = (1

If the output beam is predominantly left circularly polarised, σzout > 0, and
PL > PR. A right circularly polarised beam has σzout < 0, and PR > PL. It is

incident beam will be reﬂected from the trapped particle;

5 Conclusion

A simple method of measuring the rotation speed and the optical torque applied
to a laser trapped birefringent particle has been described. This method can
be used even if the viscosity of the medium in which trapping is performed
is unknown, and provides a means to measure this viscosity. Thus, this
method is suitable for employment in a micro-rheometer, which could be simply
constructed by trapping a birefringent probe particle in the ﬂuid of interest. A
suitable test particle would be a small fragment of calcite, the exact shape not
being critical at the very low Reynolds numbers encountered in these cases, or
a more ideal shape could be fabricated from a birefringent polymer [11]. As
the optical torque can be controlled by varying the power, the probe particle
rotation speed can be varied, allowing, for example, the investigation of non-
linear properties of the ﬂuid. Wall eﬀects and the small-scale behaviour of

polymer and colloidal suspensions could be investigated, or even the rheological
properties of intracellular ﬂuids or membranes in vivo.

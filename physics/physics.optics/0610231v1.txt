We propose a way to control solitons in χ(2) (quadratically-nonlinear) systems by means of periodic
modulation imposed on the phase-mismatch parameter (“mismatch management”, MM). It may be
realized in the co-transmission of fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves in
a planar optical waveguide via a long-period modulation of the usual quasi-phase-matching pattern
of ferroelectric domains. The MM may also be implemented by dint of the Feshbach resonance in
a harmonically-modulated magnetic ﬁeld in a hybrid atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), with the atomic and molecular mean ﬁelds (MFs) playing the roles of the FF and SH,
respectively. The problem is analyzed by two methods. First, we identify stability regions for spatial
solitons in the MM system, in terms of the MM amplitude and period, using the MF equations for
spatially-inhomogeneous conﬁgurations.
In particular, an instability enclave is found inside the
stability area.The robustness of the solitons is also tested against variation of the shape of the
input pulse, and a threshold for the formation of stable solitons is found in terms of its power.
Interactions between solitons are virtually unaﬀected by the MM. The second method (parametric
approximation), going beyond the MF description, is developed for spatially-homogeneous states.
It demonstrates that the MF description is valid for large modulation periods, while at smaller
periods the non-MF component acquires gain, which implies destruction of MF under the action of
the high-frequency MM.

INTRODUCTION

Solitons are robust localized pulses that have been predicted theoretically and created experimentally in diverse
physical settings. The current research in this ﬁeld is heavily focused on nonlinear optics [1] and Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) [2]. Typical solitons are found in uniform media with constant characteristics. However, in
many cases it is necessary to consider solitary waves (which are also called “solitons”, in a loose sense, even if
they are not described by integrable equations) traveling across heterogeneous media, or subjected to strong time
modulation. A well-known example of the former setting is dispersion management, which is an important concept
in ﬁber-optic telecommunications, helping to support stable soliton trains used as data-carrying streams [3, 4]. On
the other hand, a possibility to stabilize matter-wave solitons by means of the nonlinearity management, applied to
them via the Feshbach resonance in a modulated magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., time-periodic variation of the scattering length
that determines the coeﬃcient in front of the cubic term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation), in one-dimensional (1D)
[5] and 2D [6] geometries, has drawn considerable attention in the studies of BEC. Another example of a setting
supporting the transmission of robust solitons in a strongly heterogeneous periodic system, that combines features
of both the dispersion management and nonlinearity management, is the split-step model (SSM). In the simplest
case, it is composed of periodically alternating pieces of optical ﬁbers with zero dispersion and zero nonlinearity (i.e.,
it is built as a periodic concatenation of nonlinear and dispersive segments, the latter ones taken with anomalous
In a more realistic variant of the SSM, the nonlinear and dispersive segments are allowed to
dispersion) [4, 7].
have nonvanishing dispersion and nonlinearity, respectively [8]. Multicomponent generalizations of the SSM were
elaborated too, including one for the WDM (wavelength-division-multiplexed) system [9], and a model taking into
regard two polarizations of light [10].

In the above-mentioned examples, solitons are supported by the cubic nonlinearity of the medium. It is well known
that the quadratic (second-harmonic-generating, alias χ(2)) nonlinearity also gives rise to stable solitons, that have
been studied in detail theoretically and experimentally in optics [11]. In most cases, these are spatial solitons, i.e.,
self-supporting localized beams in bulk or (which is more relevant to the present work) planar waveguides. Temporal
χ(2) solitons have been created too [11, 12], but under very sophisticated conditions.

In terms of BEC, a counterpart of the second-harmonic generation is the Feshbach association in atomic BEC
[13, 14, 15], induced by the coupling of atomic and molecular mean ﬁelds (MFs) with the help of resonant optical
ﬁelds or by hyperﬁne interactions, using the Zeeman eﬀect for the mismatch tuning. Quadratic solitons in BEC
have been predicted in Ref. [16]. In terms of the comparison with optics, these solitons in BEC may be classiﬁed as

2

temporal ones.

In those studies, it was established that conditions for the existence and stability of χ(2) solitons are most sensitive to
the mismatch between the fundamental-frequency (FF) wave and the second harmonic (SH), or, in terms of the BEC,
between the atomic and molecular MFs. This fact suggests a natural question, which is the subject of the present
paper – how the quadratic solitons will react to a periodic modulation of the mismatch, i.e., “mismatch management”
(MM). The issue is of general interest, as a possible contribution to the theory of the “soliton management” [4],
and may also be potentially promising as concerns the use of χ(2) spatial solitons in optical switching [11] and other
applications to photonics. As for the soliton-management schemes, almost all of them were explored in terms of media
with the cubic nonlinearity; the only example dealing with a χ(2) setting was the model of “tandem solitons”, which
assumed their transmission in a waveguide built as a concatenation of χ(2)and linear segments, in 1D [17] and 2D [18]
geometry (actually, the purpose of the tandem model was to reduce the mismatch).

A ubiquitous approach to the reduction of mismatch in optical waveguides is based on the use of the quasi-phase-
matching (QPM) scheme, in which the material of the χ(2) waveguide is subjected to periodic poling (since the
material, such as LiNbO3, is a ferroelectric, this is usually carried out through periodic reversal of the orientation of
ferroelectric domains) [19]. The poling gives rise to a change of the sign of the χ(2) coeﬃcient with a certain period,
LQPM, and thus adds an extra wave vector, kQPM = (2π/LQPM) ez, aligned with the propagation direction, ez, to
the relation between the FF and SH wave vectors, kFF and kSH, which may be used to cancel the original mismatch,
kSH. In terms of this technique, the MM may be implemented by imposing a long-period supermodulation on
2kFF −
the QPM poling.

Besides its direct relevance to optics, the MM may also be implemented in the above-mentioned atomic-molecular
BEC, through the Feshbach-management technique. As mentioned above, in terms of BEC, the application of the
latter technique, which is based on the Feshbach resonance driven by a modulated magnetic ﬁeld, to the stabilization
of various types of 1D [5], 2D [6] (and also 3D [20]) matter-wave solitons was theoretically studied in detail for
the atomic BEC which obeys the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with the cubic nonlinearity, but no similar results were
reported, thus far, for atomic-molecular condensates.

Although in the limit of large values of the mismatch a χ(2) system may be reduced to a χ(3) limit by means of
the well-known cascading approximation, there is a fundamental diﬀerence between the systems. While χ(3) models
may have exact Bethe-ansatz solutions [21] even beyond the MF approximation, the introduction of the SH (the
molecular ﬁeld) lifts the integrability [22]. Thus, we expect eﬀects of MM in χ(2) systems, at small or moderate values
of the mismatch, to be diﬀerent from earlier studied eﬀects of the nonlinearity management in the χ(3) model (in the
cascading limit, the χ(2) MM goes over into the χ(3) nonlinearity management).

The objective of the paper is to study solitons and their stability in one-dimensional MM systems, in both the
optical and BEC realizations. The MF model, based on a set of partial diﬀerential equations, is introduced in Sec. II.
A piecewise-constant periodic modulation of the mismatch parameter in this model is natural in the optical setting.
Basic results for solitons in the MF model are collected in Sec. III. We report stability regions for the solitons, and
conditions necessary for their self-trapping from input beams. Interactions between the solitons are considered too,
with a conclusion that characteristics of the interactions in the MM system are virtually the same as in its ordinary
(unmodulated) counterpart.

In Sec. IV, we employ the parametric approximation [23], which goes beyond the mean ﬁeld, and is based on a
set of ordinary diﬀerential equations, in the case of spatially uniform conﬁgurations. Although this model is unable
to generate solitons, it allows us to analyze eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations, which may be important in both optical
[24] and, especially, BEC [23] realizations of the χ(2) interactions, as well as relaxation eﬀects, which may appear
in the BEC due to inelastic collisions. In the framework of this analysis, we adopt the usual, in terms of the BEC,
harmonic form of the periodic modulation of the magnetic ﬁeld which tunes the Feshbach resonance, rather than the
piecewise-constant format, adopted in the optical model. Numerical solutions of parametric-approximation equations
demonstrate that the non-condensate component in the atomic-molecular gas is not essentially excited by the MM,
under a natural condition that the modulation frequency is low enough. On the other hand, the modulation at higher
frequencies may lead to destruction of the condensate. The paper is concluded by Sec. V.

II. THE MISMATCH-MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR THE OPTICAL MEDIUM

In a normalized form, which is widely adopted in nonlinear optics, the fundamental χ(2) model in one dimension
is based on a system of coupled equations for complex local amplitudes of the FF and SH waves, u(z, x) and v(z, x)
[11]:

iuz + uxx −

2ivz + vxx −

u + vu∗ = 0,
αv + (1/2)u2 = 0,

(1)

3

(2)

(4)

(5)

where α is the mismatch parameter [this coeﬃcient is an irreducible one in the framework of the notation adopted
in Eqs. (1), if solitons are intended to be looked for in the z-independent form], and the asterisk stands for the
complex conjugation. Here, it is assumed that, in the case of spatial solitons, light propagates along axis z in a
planar waveguide with the transverse coordinate x. In terms of temporal solitons, x is the reduced-time variable. MF
equations for atomic-molecular BEC in an atomic waveguide, where x is directed along the waveguide axis, can be
reduced to the form of Eq. (1) as well, with z being time (see Sec. IV below).

In the notation of Eq. (1), complete matching is attained at α = 4, while the single exact analytical solution for

the χ(2) soliton is available at α = 1,

u =

3/√2

sech2(x/2), v = (3/2)sech2(x/2)

± (cid:16)

(cid:17)

(the Karamzin-Sukhorukov soliton [26]). At other values of α, solitons were found numerically, as well as in an
approximate analytical form, by means of the variational method [11].

The simplest model of the MM (similar, in particular, to that of the dispersion management [3, 4]) assumes periodic
modulation of α according to the following map (the latter term follows the pattern of the “dispersion-management
map” [3, 4]):

α(z) =

∆α, nL < z < (n + 1/2)L
α0 −
α0 + ∆α, (n + 1/2)L < z < (n + 1)L

(cid:26)

, n = 0, 1, 2, 3...,

(3)

where α0 is the average value of α, while ∆α and L are the amplitude and period of the periodic management. We
here assume equal lengths, L/2, of the two segments forming the MM cell. Simulations supplementing those reported
below demonstrate that a change of the relative length of the two segments (with the respective change of the local
values of the mismatch in them) produces little eﬀect on eventual results, quite similar to what is known about the
dispersion management [3, 4].

While the MM map in the piecewise-constant form of Eq. (3) is most natural in terms of optical waveguides, for
the application to the atomic-molecular BEC a more natural choice is, as mentioned above, the harmonic modulation
of the mismatch, corresponding to the periodic time dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld tuning the Feshbach resonance,
see Eq. (14) below. The experience gained in the studies of various models of the dispersion management [4] suggests
that the piecewise-constant and harmonic formats of the modulation cannot lead to qualitatively diﬀerent results.

Equations (1) conserve a known integral of motion, viz., Manley-Rowe invariant,

even in the case of the z-dependent mismatch parameter, whereas the Hamiltonian corresponding to Eqs. (1) is not
conserved. In addition, in the case of “walking” solitons [25] [in fact, these are spatial solitons tilted in the plane of
(x, z)], Eqs. (1) with variable α(z) conserve the total momentum,

It is also worthy to note that Eqs. (1) with α = α(z) are invariant with respect to the spatial Galilean boost, hence a
generic tilted soliton, (˜u, ˜v) , can be generated from the straight one by means of the corresponding transformation,

˜u(x, z)

with an arbitrary real tilt parameter c. As follows from Eqs. (4) - (5), the momentum of the tilted soliton is P = cI,
i.e., c and I play the role of the eﬀective velocity and mass of the soliton.

In the case of the atomic-molecular BEC mixture, the Galilean invariance has its literal meaning (in the temporal,

rather than spatial, domain). However, it is broken if the axial trapping potential is taken into regard.

III. DYNAMICS OF SPATIAL SOLITONS UNDER THE MISMATCH MANAGEMENT IN THE
OPTICAL MODEL

A. Formation of stable mismatch-managed solitons

To simulate the transmission of spatial optical solitons under the MM conditions, we solved equations (1) with MM
map (3) by means of the split-step numerical method, which uses the Fourier transform to handle the linear stage of

the evolution. As the input (initial pulse), we took either an ordinary soliton corresponding to the averaged version of
the model, i.e., one with α(z)
α0, or a deliberately altered pulse, to verify whether the MM system will provide for
self-trapping into a stable transmission regime. Below, we display systematic results obtained for α0 = 1 and α0 = 2
(comparison with results collected with other values of the average mismatch parameter demonstrate that these two
cases adequately represent the generic situation). In particular, for α0 = 1 we launched the initial pulse taken as
exact solution (2) corresponding to α = 1. For α0 = 2, we typically used either a soliton solution found in a numerical
form for α = 2, or, in order to try the eﬀect of a strong change of the input, we again took expression (2), i.e., the
exact soliton appertaining to α = 1. At a ﬁxed value of α0, results were collected by varying the MM amplitude ∆α
and period L.

First, in Fig. 1 we display a typical numerical solution for α0 = 1, L = 1 and ∆α = 1, generated with the use of
exact soliton (2) as the initial condition. In this ﬁgure, panels (a) and (b) present the evolution of the FF and SH
components of the ﬁeld. In fact, in all cases considered, there was no conspicuous diﬀerence in the dynamics of the two
components, therefore in other cases shown below we only display the picture for the FF beam. As is seen from Fig.
1, the input beam readily gives rise to a robust spatial soliton (intrinsic pulsations with period L = 1, caused by the
MM, are almost invisible in Fig. 1); the soliton remains stable in indeﬁnitely long simulations. The transient stage,
necessary for the self-trapping, is fairly short, comprising a few MM cells. In the subsequent evolution, gradually
fading residual oscillations of the pulse’s amplitude can be seen, with a period covering several cells (these oscillations
are caused by the initial perturbation, rather than the periodic MM). Further examples of stable transmission regimes
are displayed below in Figs. 3(a) and (c).

B. Stability diagrams

Conclusions drawn from systematic simulations are summarized in the stability diagrams, which are displayed in
Fig. 2 for α0 = 1 (a) and α0 = 2 (b). As said above, in the former case we launched the pulse corresponding to
Karamzin-Sukhorukov soliton (2), which is an exact solution for α(z)
1, and in the latter case the initial pulse
≡
2. The diagrams display areas in parameter
was a numerically found stationary soliton corresponding to α(z)
plane (∆α, L) where the initial pulse gives rise to stable transmission, or decay of the pulse [an example of the latter
outcome is displayed below in Fig. 3(b)]. Naturally, the stability regions tend to extend along the parameter axes, as,
in either limit of ∆α
0, this is provided
by averaging), where the initial pulse represents an ordinary stable soliton.

Generally, the instability of the χ(2) solitons in a part of the parameter space may be realized as a result of a
resonance between the perturbation frequency, introduced by the periodic action of the MM, and the frequency of the
intrinsic mode, which, as is well known, χ(2) solitons have in the system with constant coeﬃcients [on the contrary to
the nonlinear-Schr¨odinger (NLS) solitons] [11]. Indeed, comparison of the numerically found instability border, shown

FIG. 2: Stability and instability areas in the mismatch-management model, in the plane of the management amplitude (∆α)
and period (L). Panels (a) and (b) display the stability diagrams for the model with average mismatch α0 = 1 and α0 = 2,
respectively. In either case, the diagram was built by collecting results of many simulations, with the input taken as a soliton
of the respective averaged model, i.e., one with α(z) ≡ α0 [for α0 = 1, the initial pulse is the analytical Karamzin-Sukhorukov
solution, given by Eq. (2)].

in Figs. 2(a) and (b), with values of the intrinsic eigenfrequency, which are known from numerical computations too,
demonstrates that the explanation of the instability by the resonance is feasible, although the intrinsic frequency is
deﬁned for inﬁnitely small perturbations, while the instability sets in when the solitons are strongly perturbed.

It is also relevant to note that, in the limit of large positive values of mismatch α, the SH (or the molecular MF,
u2/2α,
in terms of BEC) can be eliminated from Eqs. (1) by means of the well-known cascading approximation, v
reducing the χ(2) system to the single NLS equation. The same is valid when the large mismatch is subjected to the
management [provided that α(z) does not change its sign]. In that case, the cascading limit will lead (as mentioned
above) to the NLS equation featuring periodic nonlinearity management [4]. In fact, solitons in the latter equation
and their stability were investigated in some detail in various contexts [4, 5]. In particular, a resonant mechanism of
the destabilization of higher-order solitons (bound states of fundamental solitons) under the action of the nonlinearity
management, qualitatively similar to one outlined above, has been demonstrated in Ref. [27].

≈

A noteworthy feature of the diagrams is the presence of an instability enclave inside the stability area. In Fig. 2(a),
the enclave is shown symbolically by a square, as exact delineation of its borders requires extremely long simulations.
In Fig. 2(b), the borders of the enclave approximately correspond to its real shape. It may be relevant to mention
that examination of similar stability diagrams in the above-mentioned SSM had revealed a diﬀerent but somewhat
similar feature, viz., a system of stability islands inside the instability area at large values of L [7]. In the present
MM model, the simulations do not reveal stability islands (on the other hand, no “instability lakes”, that would be
similar to the enclaves in Fig. 2, were found inside the stability area in the SSM). We surmise that there may exist
additional small instability enclaves, and, in principle, they may even form a fractal pattern. However, an accurate
investigation of these issues requires extremely high numerical accuracy, and they are left beyond the scope of this
work.

The existence of the instability enclave is further illustrated by a set of simulations presented in Fig. 3, which are
performed along a vertical line, ∆α = 0.3, cutting through the enclave in Fig. 2(a). A notable diﬀerence is observed in
the self-trapping into stable transmission regimes below and above the instability region: in the former case, at L = 4
(which is close to the instability border), the established pulse is very diﬀerent from the input, due to considerable
radiation loss in the process of the establishment of the stable-transmission regime (in the SH component of the wave
ﬁeld, which is not shown in Fig. 3, an approximately the same degree of the loss is observed). It is relevant to mention
that the formation of stable solitons in the SSM may also be accompanied by strong losses, depending on parameters
of the system and the form of the input [7]. On the other hand, above the instability enclave, the loss is small, and
the established soliton is closer to the input, as seen in Fig. 3(c) (the same is observed in the SH counterpart of the
latter ﬁgure, which is not shown here).

mismatch-management system with α0 = 1 and ∆α = 0.3, the modulation period being L = 4 (a), 6 (b), and 7 (c). Point (b)
falls into the instability enclave in Fig. 2(a); in this case, the soliton suﬀers, eventually, complete destruction.

C. The system’s tolerance to variations of the input pulse

Another noteworthy feature revealed by the simulations is great tolerance of the spatial solitons established in the
MM system to variance of the input beam. In particular, if the input launched into the system with α0 = 2 was
deliberately taken in the “wrong” form of expressions (2) (recall they would yield an exact solution for the averaged
equations with α = 1, rather than α = 2), the simulations, performed for various values of ∆α and L, produced a
stability diagram nearly identical to that shown in Fig. 2(b).

It is natural to expect that decrease of the input power will eventually lead to a failure in the self-trapping of the
spatial soliton, i.e., there must exist a certain power threshold for the soliton formation. To ﬁnd it, we performed
additional simulations with the inputs similar to those used above [in particular, waveform (2) was taken for α0 = 1],
but multiplied by a power-reducing factor, W < 1:

It was found that the critical value of W , below which the thus altered input pulse (2) fails to generate a stable soliton

is Wcr ≈
∆α = 0). Figures 4(a,b) show what happens when W is taken, respectively, above and below Wcr.

FIG. 5: Interaction of two identical in-phase solitons in the ordinary χ(2) model (with α = 1, ∆α = 0) (a), and its mismatch-
managed counterpart with α0 = ∆α = L = 1 (b). The initial separation between the solitons is ∆x = 3.8, while the minimum
separation at which the solitons do not interact is ∆xmin ≈ 5, in this case.

It was also checked that the change of the distribution of the Manley-Rowe invariant [see Eq. (4)] between the
two components of the input beam virtually does not aﬀect the self-trapping threshold (in particular, one may start
with the entire power put in the FF ﬁeld, while v0 = 0). The ordinary χ(2) system, with ∆α = 0, features a similar
property [11].

D. Soliton-soliton interactions

We have also performed systematic simulations of interactions between solitons in the MM model. It was found that
the character of the interaction remains virtually the same as in the ordinary χ(2) model with constant mismatch, that
was studied in detail in earlier works [11]. The main characteristic of the interaction is a minimum initial separation
between co-propagating identical in-phase solitons, ∆xmin, which is deﬁned so that the solitons do not demonstrate
any interaction for ∆x > ∆xmin, while, being placed at distance ∆x < ∆xmin, they start to attract each other and
eventually merge into a single beam. A typical example displayed in Fig. 5 shows that the interaction indeed seems
identical in the MM system and its ordinary counterpart.

IV. EFFECTS OF RELAXATION AND QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS

As explained in Introduction, the χ(2) model can also describe a hybrid atom-molecule BEC [13] under quasi-1D
conﬁnement.
In the parametric approximation, developed for the case of free space in Ref. [23], the condensate
is described by the following system of equations of motion for the molecular mean ﬁeld ϕm (X, t) and the atomic
annihilation operators ˆΨa (X, t):

(time-dependent) detuning D1D can be expressed, as follows, in terms of elastic scattering length abg, phenomenolog-
ical Feshbach-resonance strength ∆, the diﬀerence between the magnetic momenta of an atomic pair in the open and

In the present analysis, the initial moment, t = 0, corresponds to a relatively small detuning. As the initial state

Unlike the 3D case [23], the 1D problem does not require renormalization, as the integral of ms is free of the
ultraviolet divergence. Nevertheless, it now diverges at zero momentum. This formal infrared divergence is related to
phase ﬂuctuations and to the absence of true condensate in the inﬁnite 1D system. However, in the present work we
actually consider coordinate-dependent solitons, while the divergence is a consequence of the neglect of the coordinate
dependence in the parametric approximation. A more careful analysis of the inhomogeneous case yields an asymptotic
estimate, ms (p, t)
pmin, where the characteristic momentum is inversely proportional to the soliton’s
size, pmin = 1/√mgΦ. Thus, pmin may be naturally chosen as the lower-integration limit in Eq. (13). The resultant
value of the integral features a weak dependence on the lower limit, as the divergence is logarithmic.

FIG. 6: (Color online) Densities of the molecular and atomic fractions in the condensate (solid and dashed lines), and of
non-condensate atoms (dot-dashed lines), calculated with ∆α = 1 for L = 3 (a) and L = 2 (b), see Eq. (14).

Figure 6(a) demonstrates that, for large modulation periods in Eq. (14), the non-condensate fraction remains below
the level of 10%, and the lifetime due to the deactivation is large enough to allow experimental observation of the
soliton dynamics described in the previous sections, in terms of the optical medium, in the hybrid atom-molecule
BEC too.

However, Fig. 6(b) demonstrates that the non-condensate fraction of the atomic population acquires substantial
gain for smaller modulation periods. Therefore, the mean-ﬁeld approach may not be applicable in this region for the
description of the atom-molecular quantum gas, and new instability mechanisms can be expected.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have proposed a model of the second-harmonic-generating (χ(2)) system with the mismatch
parameter subjected to the periodic modulation (“mismatch management”, MM). The system may be implemented
in two altogether diﬀerent physical contexts: the co-propagation of the FF (fundamental-frequency) and SH (second-
harmonic) waves in a planar optical waveguide, and atomic-molecular mixtures in the BEC (in the latter setting, the
atomic and molecular mean ﬁelds play the roles of the FF and SH components, respectively). The most physically
relevant approach to the realization of the MM in these media are, respectively, a long-period supermodulation imposed
on top of the quasi-phase-matching periodic arrangement of ferroelectric domains in the χ(2) optical waveguide, such as
LiNbO3, and the Feshbach resonance tuned by a modulated magnetic ﬁeld in the atomic-molecular BEC. Accordingly,
the natural form of the periodic modulation is piecewise-constant in the former case, and harmonic in the latter one.
The main issue considered in the framework of the mean-ﬁeld approach was identiﬁcation of the stability region for
the mismatch-managed spatial solitons in the plane of two control parameters, ∆α and L (the MM amplitude and
period). In particular, a notable feature of the stability area is the existence of an instability enclave embedded in it.
Also investigated was the robustness of the solitons against variation of the shape of the input beam, and reduction
of its power. It was found that the stability of the established regime virtually does not depend on the particular
shape of the input, as well as on distribution of the total power (Manley-Rowe invariant) between the FF and SH
component in the input. On the other hand, reduction of the initial peak power by a factor of W < 1 reveals the
existence of a threshold, Wcr ≈
In the model of the atomic-molecular BEC, we have demonstrated that the time-evolution equations for the mean
ﬁelds are tantamount to the spatial-evolution equations in the optical model. On the other hand, important issues in
the context of BEC are the stability of the condensate against generation of ﬂuctuational (non-condensate) components
in the degenerate quantum gas, and losses due to inelastic collisions. These eﬀects were analyzed within the parametric
approximation, which goes beyond the mean-ﬁeld description. Numerical calculations have demonstrated that, quite

0.72, below which the initial pulse decays.

naturally, the condensate is eﬀectively stable against the periodic perturbations introduced by the MM in the low-
frequency modulation format, and unstable in the high-frequency regime.

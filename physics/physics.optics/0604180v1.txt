We desribe a method to probe the spetral (cid:29)utuations of a transition over broad ranges of

frequenies and timesales with the high spetral resolution of Fourier spetrosopy, and a temporal

resolution as high as the exited state lifetime, even in the limit of very low photoounting rates.

The method derives from a simple relation between the (cid:29)uoresene spetral dynamis of a single

radiating dipole and its (cid:29)uoresene intensity orrelations at the outputs of a ontinuously sanning

Mihelson interferometer. These (cid:28)ndings de(cid:28)ne an approah to investigate the fast (cid:29)uoresene

spetral dynamis of single moleules and other faint light soures beyond the time-resolution

apabilities of standard spetrosopy experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Chromophores embedded in a ondensed medium inevitably exhibit time-dependent, (cid:29)utuating optial properties

reporting on the dynamis of their nanosale environment. Studied on ensembles of moleules [1℄, these (cid:29)utuations

illuminate the omplex dynamis of a broad range of disordered host systems suh as low-temperature glasses, proteins

and liquids, over timesales extending from femtoseonds to hours [2, 3℄. Observed at the single emitter level, hro-

mophore (cid:29)utuations reveal surprisingly varied and omplex dynamial phenomena kept hidden in ensemble-averaged

experiments [4℄, whose understanding is ruial for developing appliations suh as single moleule probes in biophysis

or single photon soures in quantum information proessing [5℄.

Single moleule spetrosopy reahes its fullest potential when ombined with high time resolution, so as to resolve

the fast proesses and temporal heterogeneities of any given isolated emitter. Obtained down to timesales shorter than

the exited state lifetime for single emitter intensity (cid:29)utuations [6℄, high time resolution proves muh more di(cid:30)ult

to ahieve when probing spetral (cid:29)utuations, due to the (cid:28)nite integration time (typially larger than milliseonds)

neessary to ollet enough photons to measure the spetrum of the emitter [7℄.

The (cid:28)rst attempt to ahieve fast single moleule spetrosopy was undertaken by Plakhotnik, who demonstrated

that time resolution ould be improved by averaging the autoorrelation funtions of many individual fast san spetra

provided by single moleule laser spetrosopy [8, 9℄. The time resolution of this intensity-time-frequeny orrelation

(ITFC) method is however tehnially limited to the order of milliseonds by the (cid:28)nite san rate of the laser, and

no appliation followed this pionneering work. As a result, our urrent understanding of fast spetral (cid:29)utuations in

single emitters is so far mostly inferred from inhomogenously broadened ensemble experiments.

In this artile, we desribe an approah overoming these limitations to explore the spetral dynamis of a single

transition at both high temporal and high spetral resolutions with standard photoounting equipment, and without

requiring mode-loked laser soures for exitation as in ITFC. The method is based on the observation that spetral

(cid:29)utuations under ontinuous exitation an be diretly enoded in the intensity orrelation funtions measured at the

output of a ontinuously sanning Mihelson interferometer by a pair of photodiodes followed by a photon orrelation

ounting board [Fig. 1℄. The setup is investigated theoretially, simulated numerially, and ompared to standard

spetrosopy experiments.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Intensity orrelation funtions at the output of a sanning interferometer

The basis of our approah is the existene of an intimate relation between the spetral (cid:29)utuations of a transition and

the intensity orrelation funtion of its radiated (cid:28)eld after transmission through a sanning Mihelson interferometer.

We (cid:28)rst derive this relation in the ase of a monohromati transition undergoing random stationnary (cid:29)utuations

δω(t) around a frequeny ω0 = hω(t)i over a mean-squared range σ2 = hδω(t = 0)2i, and later generalize to (cid:29)utuating

transitions with any lineshape.

Starting from an initial optial path di(cid:27)erene δi at time t = 0, the mirror travelling at a onstant veloity V reates
a time dependent optial path di(cid:27)erene δ(t) = δi +2V t between the two arms of the interferometer. After entering the

interferometer, frequeny (cid:29)utuations propagate in the arms and reombine on the beamsplitter. This reombination

an be desribed as instantaneous, as the retardation e(cid:27)ets (of order δi/c) indued by optial path di(cid:27)erenes δi
shorter than the maximum possible oherene length cT1 of the emitter remain neglible over the timesales τ > T1
onsidered throughout this paper (i.e. δi/c ≪ τ . See also [10℄). Hene, we have :

These osillating intensities feed a photon ounting board integrating photons between t = 0 up to a time t = T for

omputing the time-averaged intensity orrelation funtion between the two outputs of the interferometer

Ia(t) ∝ 1 + cos[(2V t + δi)ω(t)/c]
Ib(t) ∝ 1 − cos[(2V t + δi)ω(t)/c].

g(τ ) =

Ia(t)Ib(t + τ )

,

where ... denotes time-averaging from t = 0 up to t = T . The integration time T is hosen so that the orresponding
hange in optial path di(cid:27)erene ∆ = δ(T ) − δ(0) = 2V T spans a large number of fringes, reduing the time-averages

in Equation 2 to :

g(τ ) = 1 −

with α(t) = 2δω(t + τ )V τ /δi + (1 + 2V t/δi)ζτ (t), where ζτ (t) = δω(t + τ ) − δω(t) denotes the random frequeny
(cid:29)utuation observed between times t and t + τ .

This general expression of g(τ ) simpli(cid:28)es with an appropriate hoie of the sanning parameters V and δi , sine the
(cid:28)rst term of α(t) beomes negligible in g(τ ) at slow sanning veloities, when 2δω(t + τ )V τ /δi ∼ 2σV τ /δi ≪ c/δi , i.e.
as the hange in the optial path 2V τ ouring over the timesale τ under investigation remains small ompared to
the oherene length Λ = c/σ of the emitter. The quantity α(t) then redues to α(t) = ζτ (t) in Eq. 3 when δi ≫ ∆,

and the intensity orrelation funtion beomes :

g(τ ) = 1 −

cos(2ω0V τ /c + ζτ (t)δi/c)dt.

For integration times T muh larger than the typial timesale over whih spetral (cid:29)utuations our, time averages
an be replaed by the ensemble-average over the distribution pτ (ζ) of all the possible realizations of the random
variable ζ = ζτ (t = 0), so g(τ ) now beomes :

when the (cid:29)utuation proess is time-reversal invariant, whih imposes pτ (ζ) = pτ (−ζ).

Hene, provided the two onditions i) 2V τ ≪ c/σ and ii) δi ≫ ∆ are ful(cid:28)lled, the time-averaged intensity orrelation
funtion g(τ ) measured at the output of a sanning Mihelson interferometer osillates with the frequeny 2ω0V /c

at whih fringes osillate on the photodetetors, and with an amplitude given by the value of the Fourier transform

FT[pτ (ζ)](θ) at θ = δi/c, where pτ (ζ) is the distribution of frequeny shifts.

General ase : narrow transition with arbitrary lineshape

The result obtained above holds for (cid:29)utuating transition of any (narrow) lineshape, integration over the (cid:28)nite

linewidth simply hanging the distribution of frequeny shifts pτ (ζ) into the more general expression :

where h...i denotes ensemble averaging over all possible realizations of spetral (cid:29)utuations, and st(ω) is the time-

resolved emission spetrum of the transition [2℄ :

where T1 is the exited state lifetime of the transition. Remarkably, Eq. 5 identi(cid:28)es with the time-frequeny spetrum
provided by past ITFC experiments, and is the Fourier transform (in ζ ) of the eho obtained in three-pulse photon

eho spetrosopy [2, 9℄.

Photon-orrelation Fourier spetrosopy

The key point is that at timesales τ shorter than the periodiity πc/ω0V at whih the fringes osillate on the
photodetetors, ondition i) (f. 2.1) is automatially ful(cid:28)lled for any narrow spetral (cid:29)utuations (i.e. when σ ≪ ω0 )

and Eq. 4 an be reverted as :

pτ (ζ) = 2FT

−1[1 − g(τ )]ζ=2πc/δi .

The distribution of the spetral (cid:29)utuations pτ (ζ) of the emitter an therefore be determined diretly from the
measurement of its (cid:29)uoresene intensity orrelation funtion g(τ ) at various optial path di(cid:27)erenes δi of the sanning

interferometer.

Determining the distribution pτ (ζ) of an emitter rather than its (cid:29)uoresene spetrum st(ω) suggests an original

approah to investigate its fast spetral dynamis, very muh in the same way that measuring an intensity autoor-

relation funtion instead of an intensity time trae transformed the study of photon statistis on short timesales in

faint light soures suh as distant stars or nanosale emitters [11℄. This an be understood by taking a loser look at

some of the general properties of the distribution pτ (ζ). When τ → ∞, the spetra st(ω) and st+τ (ω) are statistially
independent, and so pτ (ζ) redues to the autoorrelation of the time-averaged (inhomogenous) linewidth s(ω − ω0) of
the transition aessed by any standard (cid:29)uoresene spetrosopy experiment. On the ontrary, in the limit τ → 0,
pτ (ζ) is given by the autoorrelation of the time-resolved (homogenous) Lorentzian lineshape of purely radiative width
, as no (cid:29)utuation has time to our within delays τ = 0. The distribution pτ (ζ) hene naturally bridges the gap
T

−1
1

between single moleule (cid:29)uoresene tra jetory analysis and ultra-fast spetrosopy ensemble experiments.

The time-frequeny distribution pτ (ζ) also has the property of being time-independent for any stationnary dis-
tribution of (cid:29)utuations. The measurement of pτ (ζ) an therefore be made by integrating photon oinidenes over

long durations to improve signal-to-noise ratio without degrading temporal and spetral resolutions. Derived within

the frame of lassial eletrodynamis, our analysis extends down to timesales τmin as short as the exited state
lifetime of the emitter T1 , readily aessible by the modi(cid:28)ed Hanbury-Brown Twiss photon orrelation detetion setup

desribed Fig. 1 [10℄. This approah - whih we all photon orrelation Fourier spetrosopy (PCFS) - therefore om-

bines the high spetral resolution ζmin ∼ c/δi of Fourier spetrosopy with a high temporal resolution down to the
Fourier-transform limit τminζmin ∼ 1, beyond the urrent apabilities of standard single moleule experiments.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSION

Numerial simulations were performed to investigate the validity of PCFS for exploring fast spetral (cid:29)utuations

and highlight some of its instrumental properties. All simulations were made assuming an exited state lifetime

in standard single moleule spetrosopy experiments for emitters suh as moleules or semiondutor quantum dots.

T1 = 1 ns, and fast random spetral (cid:29)utuations over a total range δλ = 2λ0σ/ω0 = 1 nm around an average
wavelength λ0 = 600 nm, with an exponential frequeny orrelation funtion C(τ ) = hδω(t)δω(t + τ )i of orrelation
0 C(t)dt/σ2 = 5 µs. The hoie of these numerial parameters orresponds to typial values as enountered

PCFS measurements were numerially simulated with a speed of the translation stage set to V = 30 µm/s to
ful(cid:28)ll ondition i) (V ≪ 1.8 mm/s) over timesales τ < 100 ms. The photon arrival times at the entrane of the
interferometer were drawn aording to the Poissonian statistis of a light beam of intensity I = 5 × 104
This orresponds to a situation where spetral (cid:29)utuations our at timesales τc = 5 µs muh faster than the average
delay I −1 = 20 µs between two suessive photodetetion events, and so are ompletely averaged out in standard single

photons/s.

moleule spetrosopy experiments. The photons were statistially direted towards either photodiode depending on

their wavelength and arrival time in the interferometer. Intensity orrelation funtions were alulated for various δi
by integrating photons over 30 fringes over 500 sans, orresponding to a total aquisition time of 5 min per intensity

orrelation funtion.

PCFS and spetral (cid:29)utuation dynamis analysis

We (cid:28)rst investigated the outome of a PCFS experiment for a transition undergoing disrete spetral (cid:29)utuations,

with a frequeny ω(t) swithing between two values ω1 and ω2 = ω1 + Ω (here orresponding to wavelength jumps of
±1 nm) as a random telegraph signal S(t) [Fig. 2, Tab. 1℄ as enountered in the study of hromophores interating

with the two-level systems in glasses at low temperature [2℄. The transition frequeny (cid:29)utuations were generated

with exponentially distributed waiting times of rate k1 and k2 with k1 = k2 (and τc = [k1 + k2]−1

). Observed in

standard spetrosopy, the transition spetrum would appear as predited by the Anderson-Kubo lineshape theory

[12℄, i.e. a doublet of separation Ω = 2σ entered in [ω1 + ω2]/2, indisernible from the spetrum of a stati doublet
of transitions at frequenies ω1 and ω2 with similar intensities.

Figure 2 shows the result of PCFS experiments on a stati doublet (left), and on the swithing transition (right).

Tab. I (cid:21) Theoretial expression of the intensity orrelation funtion g(τ ) measured in PCFS for disrete and
ontinuous spetral (cid:29)utuations. C(τ ) = hδω(t)δω(t + τ )i is the frequeny orrelation funtion of the (cid:29)utuations.
pi=1,2 denote the fration of time spent by the transition in states 1 and 2 respetively.

As seen in Fig. 2(a)(d), in both ases, the shape of the intensity orrelation funtion strongly depends of the delay δi
where it was measured. Repeating the measurement of g(τ ) over di(cid:27)erent optial path di(cid:27)erenes δi , we determined
the evolution of g(τ ) with δi [Fig. 2(b)(e)℄, from whih the distribution pτ (ζ) was extrated with Eq. 7 [Fig. 2()(f )℄.
For a stati spetrum, photons do not exhibit spetral orrelation, and so pτ (ζ) redues to the autoorrelation of

the time-averaged spetrum measured in standard spetrosopy (here a doublet), i.e. a triplet of lines of intensities

{1/4,1/2,1/4} at frequenies {−Ω, 0, +Ω} independently of the timesale τ , as observed in the experimental results

shown Fig. 2().

For the swithing transition, this pattern is only preserved over timesales where (cid:29)utuations are unorrelated, i.e.

when τ > τc = 5 µs [Fig. 2(f )℄, and breaks down as soon as τ ∼ τc , when the sidebands of pτ (ζ) in ζ = ±Ω deay
progressively as τ dereases, asymptotially leaving us with the autoorrelation of the time resolved spetrum of the
. Interestingly, the alulation of g(τ ) from Eq. 4-6 (f. Tab. 1)
transition as τ → 0 - here a Lorentzian of width T

−1

indiates that the orrelation funtion of the random telegraph signal governing the frequeny swithing proess is

diretly enoded in the deay of the sidebands amplitude AΩ with τ .

The insets in Fig. 2()(f ) - showing the orrelation funtions C(τ ) extrated from the deay of the measured sideband
amplitudes AΩ - on(cid:28)rm this predition. Indeed, they indiate respetively that the stati and dynami doublet exhibit

null and exponentially deaying orrelation funtion, as expeted. Illustrated here on binary spetral jumps, the ability

of PCFS to investigate spetral (cid:29)utuations dynamis down to the exited state lifetime of the emitter an also be

exploited on a transition oupled to a olletion of (cid:29)ipping two-level systems, for example to determine the detailed

physial properties of the latter (energy splittings Ω, swithing timesales τc , et.) [9℄.

High-resolution spetrosopy beyond temporal inhomogenous broadening

PCFS also opens a perspetive for performing high resolution spetrosopy despite the presene of broad, fast,

ontinuous spetral (cid:29)utuations, as reported on most emitters - often down to low temperatures (4.2 K) [13℄. This

point is illustrated Fig. 3, showing the result of a PCFS experiment simulated for a doublet undergoing fast stationnary

Gaussian (cid:29)utuations over a range σ muh broader than the doublet separation Ω (here σ = 5Ω), with an exponential
orrelation funtion C(τ ) (Ornstein-Uhlenbek (cid:29)utuation proess) with τc = 5 µs.

Observed in onventional spetrosopy, the transition would appear as a Gaussian lineshape of width σ , and the

existene of the underlying doublet would remain unnotied. PCFS, in omparison, reveals a ompletely di(cid:27)erent

pattern. Here again, the intensity orrelation funtions were found strongly dependent of δi [Fig. 3(a)℄, and, measured
for di(cid:27)erent values of δi , provided the distribution pτ (ζ) [Fig. 3(b)()℄. As seen in Fig. 3(), the distribution pτ (ζ) -
broad (here a Gaussian of FWHM=2σ) over durations τ > τc - progressively narrows when τ < τc . This is onsistent
with the fat that for photons separated by delays τ shorter than the (cid:29)utuation orrelation time τc , (cid:29)utuations are
inreasingly seen as (cid:16)frozen(cid:17) as τ → 0.

Due to this (cid:29)uoresene line-narrowing e(cid:27)et, the doublet an be resolved over short timesales, as seen from the

quasi-periodi osillations (of periodiity 2πc/Ω in δi ) appearing in the intensity orrelation funtion g(τ ) when τ ∼ 5

EXPERIMENTAL PROPERTIES

From a tehnial standpoint, the intensity orrelation measurements at the basis of PCFS an be onsidered as

an intensity homodyne detetion, where the osillating intensity deteted by a photodiode is demodulated by the

osillating intensity deteted on the other photodiode. A (cid:28)rst onsequene of this observation is that PCFS diretly

provides the envelope of the Fourier transform interferogram of the radiation (cid:28)eld, without the omplex demodulation

shemes usually involved in sanning Fourier spetrosopy.

Seondly, the self-demodulation proess implies that the shape of g(τ ) is robust against (cid:29)utuations in the sanning
veloity V (as aused by stik-slip and vibrations in the translation stage), and is independent of the exat average
frequeny ω0 of the transition, making PCFS intrinsially insensitive to rare, large spetral jumps whih often limit the

measurement time of laser spetrosopy experiments (e.g. the PCFS inversion formula (Eq. 8) is indeed independent

of V and ω0 ). Numerial simulations (not shown) on(cid:28)rmed this analysis. For example, random veloity (cid:29)utuations

of 30% were found to have no signi(cid:28)ant impat on any of the simulated results presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

Finally, we note that PCFS also o(cid:27)ers high time and high spetral resolution over a broad range of frequenies and

timesales, ontrasting with laser spetrosopy, whih - beause of its very sanning nature - only provides high time

and spetral resolutions simultaneously in the limit of vanishing spetral ranges.

CONCLUSION

7

Replaing the beamsplitter of a Hanbury-Brown Twiss detetion system by a sanning Mihelson interferometer

allows the measurement of spetral (cid:29)utuations of a transition at high spetral resolution, down to timesales as short

as the transition exited state lifetime, whih opens unexplored possibilities for studying the fast (cid:29)uoresene spetral

dynamis of single dipoles in a range of ontexts.

In solid state physis, this photon-orrelation spetrosopy method suggests an approah to investigate the relation

between lineshape broadening and deoherene in moleules and semiondutor quantum dots, as well as the dynamial

interations of these systems with optial (cid:28)elds and their nanosale environment. Implemented in a (cid:29)uoresene

orrelation spetrosopy (FCS) experiment, PCFS might also provide some insight into the spetral dynamis of

nanosale emitters under the in(cid:29)uene of hemial reations, onformational hanges or intermoleular interations in

liquid environments.

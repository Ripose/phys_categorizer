We report a detailed experimental study of vector modulation instability in

highly birefringent optical ﬁbers in the anomalous dispersion regime. We prove

that the observed instability is mainly induced by vacuum ﬂuctuations. The

detuning of the spectral peaks agrees with linear perturbation analysis. The

exact shape of the spectrum is well reproduced by numerical integration of

stochastic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations describing quantum propagation.

In birefringent silica ﬁbers, stable propagation of a monochromatic wave can be inhibited

by a nonlinear process called vector modulation instability (V-MI) in both dispersion regimes

(normal or anomalous).1,2,3 This contrasts with the scalar modulation instability (S-MI)

that does not require birefringence but can only arise in the anomalous dispersion regime

(at least when second order dispersion dominates4,5). Two limits, those of weak and strong

birefringence, are amenable to relatively simple analytical study.6 These predictions have

been conﬁrmed experimentally in a number of cases,7,8,9 particularly in the normal dispersion

regime.

The only experimental investigation of V-MI in the anomalous dispersion regime that we

are aware of is a recent unsuccessful attempt using photonic crystal ﬁbers.10 Here we report

what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst experimental study of V-MI in strongly birefringent silica

ﬁbers in the anomalous dispersion regime. We also carry out a very precise comparison

between experimental results and the predictions of numerical simulations.

Modulation instabilities (MI) can be induced by classical noise present initially together

with the pump beam. But MI can also arise spontaneously through ampliﬁcation of vacuum

ﬂuctuations.11 In practice classical input noise and vacuum ﬂuctuations compete for inducing

MI. The experiment reported here is carried out in the regime where the quantum noise is

dominant.

Elsewhere,12 we present an uniﬁed approach to the problem of scalar and vector MI based

on the stochastic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations (SNLSE) which generalizes the work of

Ref. 13. This approach is particularly well suited for numerical simulations in complex

situations where classical noise and vacuum ﬂuctuations act together, where the pump is

depleted, or where the higher order harmonics of MI appear. In previous work on modulation

instability, comparison between theory and experiment has generally been limited to noting

that the frequency at which the maximum gain of the MI occurs is correctly predicted.

Here we show that there is excellent agreement between the experimental results and the

numerical integration of the SNLSE. In particular the detailed shape of the output spectrum

can be predicted in detail, even in the case where higher order harmonics appear (which

cannot be predicted by linear perturbation theory). To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst time

experimental and theoretical studies of MI are compared in such detail. A related work

is the comparison between theory and experiment for RF noise measurements reported in

Ref. 14.

The experimental setup is reported in Fig. 1. It consists of a Q switched laser (Cobolt

Tango) that produces pulses at 1536 nm, with a 3.55 ns full-width-at-half-maximum

(FWHM) duration τ and a 2.5 kHz repetition rate f . The Gaussian spectral shape of the

laser has been characterized using a Fabry-Perot interferometer. The measured 0.214 GHz

FWHM spectral width is slightly larger than expected in the Fourier transform limit. The

pump power is adjusted using variable neutral density ﬁlters (ND). We measured the in-

jected mean power Pm at the end of the ﬁber. The peak power P0 is relied to the mean

power according to the relation:

P0 = 2

A polarizing beam splitter (PBS1) ensures the pump pulse is linearly polarized. A half-wave

plate is used to tune the angle θ between the pump polarization direction and the principal

axes of the ﬁber. A polarizing beam splitter (PBS2) can be used in order to observe the ﬁeld

components polarized along the fast or slow axes separately. Lastly, spectra are recorded

using an optical spectral analyser (OSA). In our experiment we use the Fibercore HB1250P

optical ﬁber. The ﬁber length L = 51 m, the group-velocity dispersion (GVD) parameter

β2 = −15 ps2 km−1 and the group-velocity mismatch parameter ∆β1 = 286.1 fs m−1 have

been measured by independent methods (only signiﬁcant digits have been indicated). Note

that the accuracy on the value of β2 is poor compared to the standards. This is because
the interferometric method15 that we used turned out to be diﬃcult to implement with a

birefringent ﬁber. The group-velocity mismatch parameter ∆β1 is deduced from the walk-oﬀ

between pulses propagating on the principal axes of the ﬁber. The ﬁber length L is deduced

from a measurement of the pulse time of ﬂight. The other important parameters of the ﬁber,

and a more accurate estimation of β2, can be inferred from MI spectral peaks positions, as

explained further.

Fig. 2 shows a typical spectrum at the ﬁber output when the angle θ is set to 45 degrees.

The fast and slow polarization components have been separated using PBS2 and their spectra

recorded successively. The plot clearly exhibits two V-MI peaks at 1511.4 nm and 1561.4 nm

that are polarized along the fast and slow axes respectively. It also shows S-MI peaks at

1530.0 nm and 1541.9 nm, with ﬁrst harmonics.

In contrast with V-MI, S-MI is equally

generated on both principal axes. By polarizing the input ﬁeld along the fast or slow axes,

we have observed that V-MI disappears and that the amplitude of the S-MI peaks increases

for S-MI and V-MI peaks respectively. Here, γ stands for the Kerr nonlinearity parameter of

the ﬁber. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the spectrum of light emerging from the ﬁber when
the pump power is increased. Using Eqs. (2) and (3), the ratios ∆β1
|β2| = 18.740 (rad) THz
and γ
|β2| = 0.2135 (rad) THz2 W−1 where deduced from these measurement. The ﬁrst ratio
and the measured value of ∆β1 permits to infer that β2 = −15.27 ps2 km−1, which is

compatible with the independently measured value. From the second ratio, we deduce that

γ = 3.26 W−1 km−1.

The exponential growth of the MI peaks and harmonics is clearly apparent on Fig. 3.

From these measurements we deduce that the ratio between the maximum gain of the V-MI

and of the S-MI is 0.67±0.05, in good agreement with the theoretical value 2/3. We also ﬁnd

that the ratio between the maximum gain of the 1st harmonic and of the S-MI is 1.88±0.15,

in good agreement with the theoretical value16,17 of 2.

We now focus on the quantitative comparison between experimental spectral amplitudes

and those predicted by the SNLSE model for spontaneous (or vacuum-ﬂuctuations induced)

modulation instabilities. This comparison makes sense because the exact shape of the spec-

trum, and in particular the relative intensities of the modulation instability peaks and har-

monics, is very strongly dependent on the initial noise and pump peak power. Experimental

and computed spectra are plotted together in Fig. 4. In the simulations we used the pa-

rameters deduced from experimental MI peaks positions (see above), but in order to obtain

a good ﬁt we had to increase the peak pump power by 5% with respect to that deduced

from the measurements using Eq. (1). We are not sure of the origin of this discrepancy.

It could either be due to a systematic error in the measured values of Pm, to an error in

the experimental measure of ∆β1, to the fact that the experimental pulses are not exactly

Fourier-transform limited, or to some classical noise photons (for instance due to Raman

scattering in the ﬁber) that are added to vacuum ﬂuctuations and slightly speed up the

4

instability. In any case the discrepancy is small enough to conﬁdently conclude that in our

experiment the MI is mainly induced by vacuum-ﬂuctuations. Indeed with this small ad-

justment the experimental MI spectra are very well reproduced by numerical integration of

the SNLSE model.

In summary, we report what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst experimental observation of

spontaneous vector modulation instability in a highly birefringent silica ﬁber in the anoma-

lous dispersion regime. The pump power dependence of the detuning of both scalar and

vector side-bands, as well as their polarizations, agree with linear perturbation theory when

the pump depletion is small. We have also obtained very good agreement between the exper-

imental spectra and those obtained by numerical integration of the SNLSE derived from the

quantum theory. This is to our knowledge the ﬁrst time that theoretical and experimental

spectra are compared in such quantitative detail. This very good agreement between the two

approaches proves that the modulation instability that we observed was truly spontaneous,

in the sense that it mainly results from the ampliﬁcation of vacuum-ﬂuctuations.

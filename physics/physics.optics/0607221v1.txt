Abstract

We analyze the control of the propagation speed of three wave packets interacting in a medium

with quadratic nonlinearity and dispersion. We found analytical expressions for mutually trapped

pulses with a common velocity in the form of a three-parameter family of solutions of the three-

wave resonant interaction. The stability of these novel parametric solitons is simply related to the

value of their common group velocity.

A three-wave resonant interaction (TWRI) is ubiquitous in various branches of science, as

it describes the mixing of waves with diﬀerent frequencies in weakly nonlinear and dispersive

media. Indeed, TWRI occurs whenever the nonlinear waves can be considered as a ﬁrst-

order perturbation to the linear solutions of the propagation equation. TWRI has been

extensively studied alongside with the development of nonlinear optics, since it applies to

parametric ampliﬁcation, frequency conversion, stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering.

In the context of plasma physics, TWRI describes laser-plasma interactions, radio frequency

heating, and plasma instabilities. Other important domains of application of TWRI are

light-acoustic interactions, interactions of water waves, and wave-wave scattering in solid

state physics. Two classes of analytical soliton solutions of the TWRI have been known for

over three decades. The ﬁrst type of solitons describes the mixing of three pulses which travel

with their respective linear group velocity, and interact for just a short time [1, 2, 3, 4]. The

second type of solitons, also known as simultons, are formed as a result of the mutual trapping

of pulse envelopes at the three diﬀerent frequencies. Hence the three wave packets travel

locked together with a common group velocity [5]. In all of the above discussed domains

of application, parametric TWRI solitons play a pivotal role because of their particle-like

behaviour, which enables the coherent energy transport and processing of short wave packets

[1, 5, 6].

In this Letter we reveal that the class of TWRI simultons (TWRIS) is far wider than

previously known. We found a whole new family of bright-bright-dark triplets that travel

with a common, locked velocity. The most remarkable physical property of the present

solitons is that their speed can be continuously varied by means of adjusting the energy of

the two bright pulses. We studied the propagation stability of TWRIS and found that a

stable triplet loses its stability as soon as its velocity decreases below a well deﬁned critical

value. Another striking feature of a TWRIS is that an unstable triplet decays into a stable

one through the emission of a pulse, followed by acceleration up to reaching a stable velocity.

The coupled partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) representing TWRI in (1 + 1) dimen-

sions read as [2]:

where the subscripts t and z denote derivatives in the longitudinal and transverse dimension,

respectively. Moreover, En = En(z, t) are the complex amplitudes of the three waves, Vn are

their linear velocities, and n = 1, 2, 3. We assume here the ordering V1 > V2 > V3 which,

together with the above choice of signs before the quadratic terms, entails the non–explosive

character of the interaction. In the following, with no loss of generality, we shall write the

equations (1) in a reference frame such that V3 = 0. A remarkable property of the Eqs.(1)

is their invariance with respect to the transformation

ˆEn(z, t) = s exp[i(qnzn + αn)]En(sz + z0, st + t0)

(2)

where α1 + α2 + α3 = 0, qn = q(Vn+1 − Vn+2), zn = z + Vnt are the characteristic coordinates

and n = 1, 2, 3 mod(3). As the transformation (2) depends on six real parameters, namely

α1, α2, s, q, z0 and t0, clearly one may introduce these parameters in the expression of any

given solution of the TWRI equation.

Each of the above conserved quantities is related to a given internal parameter of the TWRIS

which, in turn, is associated with a symmetry (e.g., phase rotation or space translation) of

the TWRI equations (1) [7]. As a consequence, one may expect that Eqs.(1) possess a

and n = 1, 2, 3 mod (3). The above expressions depend on the ﬁve real parameters

V1, V2, p, k, q, and the complex parameter a. From the deﬁnition of Q, one can see that
the above parameters must be chosen so that if k = 0, then p2 > |a|2.

The TWRIS is composed of two bright pulses (7a, 7b), and a kink or shock-like pulse

(7c), which travel with a common locked velocity V . The expressions (7) may be represented

in a more convenient form as

En(ξ, τ ) = Un(ξ) exp[ iΦn(ξ, τ ) ], n = 1, 2, 3.

Here we used a reference frame that moves along with the soliton, with co–ordinates ξ =

z +V t, τ = t where U and Φ are real functions and Φn(ξ, τ ) = φnτ +fn(ξ). A simple analysis

of (8) shows that, for any value of the parameters, the pulse amplitudes U1(ξ), U2(ξ) and

U3(ξ) are even functions of ξ and the phase constants satisfy φ1 + φ2 + φ3 = 0. On the

other hand, if k = 0 the phase proﬁles are all piecewise linear in ξ and obey the condition

f1(ξ) + f2(ξ) + f3(ξ) = 0 for pξ > 0 and f1(ξ) + f2(ξ) + f3(ξ) = π for pξ < 0. Whereas for

k 6= 0 the phase proﬁle f3(ξ) is nonlinear and cos[f1(ξ) + f2(ξ) + f3(ξ)] is an odd function of

ξ; moreover the kink pulse E3 is “grey” if k 6= 0 and is “dark” if k = 0. Such amplitude and

phase front proﬁles prevent a net energy exchange among the three waves. It is important

to point out that the condition −1 < Q < 1 leads to a speed V that lies in-between the

characteristic velocities V1 and V2 of the two bright pulses, i.e. V1 > V > V2. The above

described properties mean that TWRIS represent a signiﬁcant generalization with respect

to previously known three-wave solitons which exhibit a simple (constant) phase proﬁle and

correspond to the special case k = q = 0 , r > 0 [5]. In Fig.1 we plotted two characteristic

examples of TWRIS amplitude and phase-fronts (7).

It is interesting to consider the physical meaning of the various TWRIS parameters ap-

pearing in (7). For a given choice of the characteristic linear velocities V1 and V2, we

are left with the four independent parameters p, k, q, and a. We may note that p is ba-

sically associated with the scaling of the wave amplitudes, as well as of the coordinates

z and t. The parameter a determines the amplitude of the asymptotic plateau of the

kink E3. The value of k provides the wave–number of a “carrier–wave”. The parameter

q adds a phase contribution which is linear in z and t. Since the system (1) is invariant

under a transformation (2), without loss of generality we may set a = 1, which reduces

the number of essential parameters to just three, corresponding to the three symmetries

of Eqs.(1). The parameters p, k, q in (7) may be more conveniently mapped into the pa-

rameters V, φ1, φ2 of Eq.(8), which provide a more direct physical insight into the features

of a TWRIS. Such a mapping is obtained by comparing Eqs.(7) with (8), and reads as:

V = 2V1V2/[ V1 + V2 − Q(V1 − V2) ], φ1 = qV2(V1 − V ) + χV + ω, φ2 = qV1(V − V2) − χV − ω.

The TWRIS is thus simply expressed in terms of its velocity V and the two phase constants

φ1 and φ2. Let us investigate what are the TWRIS properties for a ﬁxed choice of the linear

velocities V1 and V2, upon variations of its energy ﬂows and transverse momentum. As an

example, Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of the phase constant φ1 on the locked velocity

V , for the case where φ2 = −φ1, with diﬀerent values of the conserved energy I12. More-

over, Fig. 2(b) illustrates the dependence of the energies I1 and I2 (which happen to be

time–independent for a TWRIS) on the locked velocity V , for diﬀerent choices of the phase

constant φ1 = −φ2. As it can be seen, the intensity and phase proﬁles, as well as the energy

distribution among the diﬀerent wave packets, strongly depend upon the value of the locked

velocity V .

The next crucial issue is the propagation stability of TWRIS. A ﬁrst insight into this

problem may be provided by performing a linear stability analysis (LSA) as in Ref.[9]. Let

us consider a perturbed TWRIS of the form

˜En(ξ, τ ) = (xn(ξ) + Pn(ξ, τ ))eiφnτ , n = 1, 2, 3

where xn(ξ) = Un(ξ) exp[ifn(ξ)] is the soliton proﬁle, and we consider a weak perturbation

|Pn| << |xn|. By inserting the above ansatz in Eqs.(1), and by retaining only linear terms

are V1 = 2, V2 = 1, a = 1, k = 0.5, q = 1. For the stable simulton (upper ﬁgures) p = 1

in Pn, one obtains a linear system of PDEs. For the numerical analysis, these PDEs can be
reduced to a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations ˙P (τ ) = MP (τ ), by approximating the

spatial derivatives with ﬁnite diﬀerences, where P is the perturbation vector sampled on a

ﬁnite grid. A necessary condition for the instability of a stationary solution xn(ξ) is that the

matrix M has at least one eigenvalue with positive real part. Numerical computations over

a wide parameter range show that eigenvalues of M exist with a positive real part whenever

p < 0. On the other hand, for p > 0 the largest real part of the eigenvalues is equal to zero,

which means that the TWRIS are only neutrally stable. Note that the instability condition

p < 0 leads to the inequality V < Vcr = 2V1V2/(V1 + V2). Extensive numerical integrations

of Eqs.(1) conﬁrm that TWRIS with V < Vcr (V > Vcr) are always unstable (stable). The

propagation of either stable or unstable TWRIS is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the

general feature of unstable solitons with V < Vcr. Namely, the simulton decays into a stable

soliton with V > Vcr, and it emits a pulse in the wave E3.

It is quite remarkable that

the dynamics of the decay from unstable into stable solitons may be exactly described by

analytical solutions with variable velocity or boomerons [8]. A complete description of the

parametric boomerons will be the subject of a more extended report.

We performed further investigations of TWRIS stability by carrying out a multi-scale

asymptotic analysis (MAA) [10, 11]. The MAA aims to ﬁnd the rate of growth λ (with

λ << 1) of small perturbations, by linearizing Eqs.(1) around the soliton solution. This

procedure leads to a linear eigenvalue problem, whose solution can be expressed as an

asymptotic series in λ [12]. In this way, one obtains the following condition which deﬁnes

the borderline between stable and unstable TWRIS

G =

∂(I12, I 23, J)
∂(φ1, φ2, V )

= 0,

where G is the Jacobian of the constants of motion I12, I 23, J with respect to φ1, φ2, V . Note

that in (9) I 23 and J are obtained by re–normalizing the divergent integrals (5) and (6)

according to the prescription

where |E30| = limz→∞ |E3| is the asymptotic amplitude of the kink [13]. Note that the

availability of exact soliton solutions allows for the analytical calculation of the above inte-

grals, hence of the condition (9), which is an extension of the well-known Vakhitov-Kolokov

criterion. Thus (9) provides a suﬃcient stability condition, which can only be applied under

speciﬁc constraints such as φ1 = φ2. Indeed, in this case we ﬁnd that the condition G = 0

leads again to the previously found marginal stability condition V = Vcr = 2V1V2/(V1 + V2).

A direct insight into the global stability properties of TWRIS for all possible values of

their parameters can be obtained by means of a geometrical approach [14]. Indeed, TWRIS

may be obtained as solutions of the variational problem

δ(H + φ1I12 − (φ1 + φ2)I 23 − V J) = 0,

(12)

where δ is the Frech´et derivative.

In other words, TWRIS represent the extrema of the

Hamiltonian (3), for a ﬁxed value of the energies and momentum (V, φ1, φ2 represent La-

grange multipliers). Stable triplets are obtained whenever such extrema coincide with a

global minimum of H. Clearly, if multiple solutions exist with the same I12, I 23, J, the

stable solution is obtained on the lower branch of H.

(9) corresponds to solitons such that the normal vector to the three–dimensional surface

H = H(I12, I 23, J) lies in the space H = const.. The above geometrical considerations

permit the visualization of the stability boundaries when considering a projection of the

hyper-surface H = H(I12, I 23, J) on the plane (I12, H). For example, Fig. 4 displays the

dependence of H upon I12 for the case φ1 = −φ2, where the criterion (9) cannot be applied,

and in the case φ1 = φ2. Here it is evident that the two branches of the Hamiltonian merge

exactly at V = Vcr: at this point, the normal to the H curve is also orthogonal to the

vertical axis. Interestingly enough, Fig. 4 shows that the borderline TWRIS corresponds

to a minimum of the bright pulses energy I12 with respect to V . To summarize, we have

shown that diﬀerent numerical and analytical methods concur in predicting that the TWRIS

stability is determined by the condition V > Vcr.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the experimental conditions for the observation of TWRIS in nonlin-

ear optics. For instance, when considering a three-wave oeo interaction in a 5 cm-long bulk

PPLN sample with 18µm periodicity, the ﬁeld envelope carriers λE1 = 1.5µm, λE2 = 0.8µm,

λE3 = 1.8µm, pulse durations of about 1ps, TWRIS can be observed with ﬁeld intensities
of a few MW/cm2.

In conclusion, we have described a novel three-parameter family of (1+1) bright-bright-

dark soliton waves as exact solutions of the three-wave resonant interaction equation. These

TWRI solitons exhibit nonlinear phase-fronts curvatures, and exist for a given range of their

locked velocity and energy ﬂows. Their propagation stability has been investigated with the

upshot that stable triplets occur whenever their velocity V is greater than a certain critical

value Vcr. On the other hand, unstable solitons dynamically reshape into stable solitons with

9

higher velocity. The remarkable properties of these parametric solitons may open the way

to new possibilities for the control of coherent energy transport in various physical settings.

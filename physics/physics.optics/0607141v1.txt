We present experimental data of the frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) measurements of
light pulses revealing interference features corresponding to sub-Planck structures in phase space.
For superpositions of pulses a small, sub-Fourier shift in the carrier frequency leads to a state
orthogonal to the initial one, although in the representation of standard time–frequency distributions
these states seem to have a non-vanishing overlap.

It was shown by Zurek [1] that sub-Planck structures in
phase space - an unexpected sign of quantum interference
play a surprisingly important role in the distinguishabil-
ity of quantum states. A sub-Planck phase space shift of
a superposition of coherent states is suﬃcient to produce
a state which is orthogonal to the unshifted one. This
seems counter-intuitive because superpositions of coher-
ent states seem to overlap nearly perfectly, nevertheless,
due to a very small shift they can become orthogonal
to each other, which makes them - at least in principle
- distinguishable. The eﬀect was originally studied for
a superposition of four coherent states [1] and then in
[2, 3] it was shown that superpositions of just two coher-
ent states lead to a similar result.

Both in classical optics and quantum mechanics the
linear superposition principle is the basis of all interfer-
ence phenomena. Thus, it should not surprise one that if
quantum wave packets are replaced by light pulses, the
eﬀects similar to sub-Planck structures i.e. sub-Fourier
structures should be observed. In this letter an experi-
mental realization of a time-frequency version of this phe-
nomenon is reported.

Instead of superpositions of coherent states in phase
space, optical ﬁelds in the form of coherent superposi-
tions of pulses are used and the FROG spectrogram is
recorded. A speciﬁc cross-section of this spectrogram
represents a scalar product of the measured ﬁeld and the
ﬁeld with the same envelope but a shifted carrier fre-
quency. We show that for ﬁelds that have the form of a
superposition of two pulses this scalar product is an oscil-
lating function of the frequency shift. Moreover, zeros of
this scalar product are spaced by sub-Fourier distances
in the scale of the superposed pulses i.e., the distance
between them is smaller than the single pulse spectral
width.

During the last decade FROG (Frequency Resolved
Optical Gating) has become a standard method for re-

construction of the amplitude and phase of ultrashort
light pulses [4, 5, 6]. In the second harmonic version of
this technique (SH FROG) a pulse to be measured is split
and its two mutually delayed replicas are overlapped in a
nonlinear optical crystal. The sum frequency signal gen-
erated in the crystal is spectrally resolved and recorded
for diﬀerent time delays τ . The resulting time–frequency
map has the form

IF ROG(τ, ω) =

dt E(t − τ )E(t)eiωt

and its cross-section for zero delay reads

IF ROG(0, ω) =

dt E(t)E(t)eiωt

For transform-limited pulses of a given carrier frequency

ωc the form of IF ROG(0, δ + 2ωc) is the same as the one
given by Eq.(4). In other words, the τ = 0 cross-section
of the FROG map measured at 2ωc + δ is equal to an
overlap of the ﬁeld E(t) and the same ﬁeld shifted in
frequency by δ, i.e. E(t)eiδt.

Formula (6) can be derived from (7) after substituting
δ → δ + 2ωc. For t0 6= 0 Eqs. (6) and (7) have an inﬁnite
number of nearly equally spaced zeros. This means that
a superposition of two Gaussian pulses is orthogonal to
similar superpositions with appropriately shifted carrier
frequencies. Moreover, the smallest of these leading–to–
zero–overlap shifts is given approximately by π
, which
2t0
for suﬃciently large separations 2t0 becomes sub-Fourier
in a single pulse scale. These sub-Fourier shifts corre-
spond directly to the sub-Planck shifts leading to or-
thogonality of superpositions of two (or four) coherent
quantum wave packets [1, 2].

The experimental setup is presented in Fig.1. The
pulse source was a home-built Ti:Sapphire oscillator de-
livering 50 fs (FWHM) pulses centered at 780 nm with
a 80 MHz repetition rate. To generate a pulse pair with
a highly stable delay we used a half waveplate, a crys-
talline quartz block 10 mm thick (optic axis parallel to
the input surface) and a polarizer. The pulse polariza-

tion was ﬁrst rotated causing the pulse to split into two
replicas of mutually perpendicular polarizations and sim-
ilar energies in the crystal. After the polarizer set at 45
degrees with respect to the optic axis a pair of delayed

pulses with parallel polarizations emerged. The group de-
lay between 800 nm pulses propagating as ordinary and
extraordinary rays is approximately 30 fs/mm in crys-
talline quartz. The total delay was ﬁne–tuned by tilting
the quartz block. The standard FROG apparatus con-
sisted of a dielectric beamsplitter, a delay line with a
stepper motor-driven translation stage (8 fs/step), a 100
µm type I BBO crystal for second harmonic generation
and a specrometer with a linear CCD array of 2048 pixels
providing resolution better than 0.5 nm (Ocean Optics,
USB 2000).

with slightly diﬀerent separation distances 2t0 between the pulses:
a) 2t0 = 305 f s ; b) 2t0 = 309 f s. Black rectangles represent
minimal uncertainty relation areas of a single pulse, white give the
corresponding FWHM widths.

Figures 2a and 2b present the FROG spectrograms
measured for a superposition of two pulses with the sep-
aration 2t0 of 305 fs and 309 fs, respectively. Numer-
ically calculated maps for pulse pairs with parameters
corresponding to the measurements are presented in Figs.
3a and 3b. The black rectangles at the contour-plots
show minimal uncertainty relation areas of a single pulse
for λ = 390 nm, the white ones give the corresponding
FWHM widths. Figures 4a and 4b show τ = 0 cross-
sections of the measured spectrograms and the corre-
sponding theoretical ﬁts.

The dispersion σ of the superposed pulses was 20.1±0.5

length λ0 = 780 nm imposes a 8.1 ± 0.2 nm Fourier limit
on the dispersion △λ780 (or, equivalently, 19 ± 0.5 nm

equals to 2.0 ± 0.05 nm (4.7 ± 0.1 nm FWHM). The ze-
ros of the oscillating structures are less then 1.75 nm
apart, which is below the Fourier limit imposed by any
of the single pulses. These zeros correspond to carrier
frequencies shifts for which pairs of pulses have a vanish-
ing overlap (nie jestem pewien czy to co napisalem jest

corresponding numerically calculated curves. The relative phase
between the pulses was the only free parameter of the ﬁts.

The Fourier/Heisenberg uncertainty relation is cer-
tainly not violated for the state under study – the smaller

the change of the carrier frequency leading to the zero
overlap, the larger the separation distance 2t0 between
the pulses.

It is instructive to study the eﬀect demonstrated in this
paper using standard time-frequency distribution func-
tions. The Wigner distribution [8, 9] for a pulse with an
electric ﬁeld E(t) is deﬁned as

An important property of the Wigner function that links
the Wigner function of two ﬁelds E1(t), E2(t) and their
scalar product, is given by the Moyal formula:

Figure 5a presents a contour plot of the Wigner func-
tion for the superposition of two Gaussian pulses, Eq.
(5), with the separation 2t0 = 7 and σ = 1/2. The sec-
ond contour plot (Fig. 5b) corresponds to the Wigner
function of the same pair of pulses but with the carrier
frequencies shifted by π/2t0. The scalar product of the
two superpositions is zero. In the Wigner representation,
the vanishing of the scalar product may be interpreted as
an interference eﬀect: the interference fringes in Fig.5b
are shifted by half of the modulation period with respect
to those in Fig.5a. This shift causes that in the scalar
product calculated according to Eq. (9), a negative con-
tribution from the interference terms cancels exactly the
positive contribution from the Gaussian peaks.

Another widely used time-frequency distribution is the
Husimi function (or the Glauber Q-function) [10]. Fig-
ures 6a and 6b present the Husimi function calculated for
the state described by Eq.(5) with the same parameters
as those used in the evaluation of the Wigner function.

2t0
two plots appear very similar the scalar product of these two pairs
vanishes.

The plots presented in Figs 6a, 6b are almost identical.
The fact that the scalar product of the corresponding
ﬁelds vanishes is rather surprising – at least until one
recalls that the Moyal formula given by Eq.(9), is not
applicable to the Husimi function.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the presence of
sub-Fourier structures in the measured time–frequency
representation of light pulses. These structures are clas-
sical counterparts of sub-Planck features in the phase
space. The FROG spectrogram approach to interfer-
ence of optical pulses reveals a remarkable similarity to
quantum-mechanical interference phenomena. We have
shown that two pairs of pulses displaced by a small, sub-
Fourier shift of the carrier frequency may be mutually or-
thogonal even if they seem to have a non-vanishing over-

4

lap in the time-frequency representation of some com-
monly used quasi–distributions.

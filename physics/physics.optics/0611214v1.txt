Abstract

A nondestructive technique, based on Fresnel diﬀraction from phase
objects, is purposed for specifying the refractive index proﬁles of op-
tical ﬁbers without requiring index matching liquid. The method in-
volves measurement of normalized intensity distribution on the Fresnel
diﬀraction pattern of a monochromatic plane wave diﬀracted from a
ﬁber and evaluation of the ﬁber core introduced phase proﬁle from
the intensity distribution by the iteration technique which yields the
required refractive index proﬁle. Simulation and experimental studies
show that the technique is reliable and quite sensitive to refractive
index change.

1 Introduction

The refractive index proﬁle of an optical ﬁber is a signiﬁcant parameter.
There are many reports dealing with destructive and nondestructive mea-
surements of ﬁbers’ index proﬁles[1, 2, 3]. Among these techniques, those

1

based on interferometry are more reliable and accurate. In these techniques
the required information are derived from the interference fringes formed by
a part of the ﬁber in an interference microscope by diﬀerent methods, such
as FFT, Abel inversion, and so on[4, 5, 6]. The shortcomings of these meth-
ods include smallness of sample, requirement of index matching liquid, and
time consuming slice sample preparation for destructive measurement. Two
popular non-interferometric techniques are ray tracing and focusing methods
[1, 7]. In the former, it is necessary to scan the ﬁber core perpendicular to
the ﬁber axis by a very narrow beam and trace the output beam carefully,
which is a tricky process. In the latter technique, the ﬁber is illuminated by
an incoherent parallel beam perpendicular to the ﬁber axis and the intensity
distribution is measured at a plane outside the core. It is diﬃcult to locate
the accurate location of the latter plane and this aﬀects the result consider-
ably. Both techniques require index matching liquid and since microscope is
used, samples of small sizes can be studied.

Recently, it has been shown that Fresnel diﬀraction from ﬁxed and vari-
able phase steps has numerous application potentials [8, 9]. For example, it
renders to measure phase distribution in one dimension very accurately. In
this report we treat the optical ﬁber as a 1D phase object and illuminate it
perpendicular to its axis by a parallel coherent beam of monochromatic light.
The required refractive index proﬁle is obtained by measuring the normalized
intensity distribution on the diﬀraction pattern of ﬁber in the Fresnel ﬁeld
and evaluating the ﬁber phase proﬁle from the latter by iteration technique.
The technique has been applied to step index and graded index ﬁbers suc-
cessfully. Although, immersing the ﬁber into a liquid reduces the refractive
index diﬀerence between the cladding and the surrounding, and this enhances
the sensitivity of the technique, but it is not crucial. Also, it is shown that
consideration of the inclination factor in the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ integral has
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on intensity distribution.

The report is organized as follows. In Section 2 theoretical approach and
In Section 3 experimental procedure and

simulation study are presented.
results are covered. Conclusions are included in Section 4.

2 Theoretical approach

2.1 Step index ﬁber

In ﬁgure 1(a), a monochromatic parallel beam of light strikes an optical ﬁber
perpendicular to its axis. The cross sections of the ﬁber core and cladding
are represented by two concentric circles of radii a and b. We treat the ﬁber
as a thin strip of width 2b parallel to the ﬁber axis with phase distribution
across its width. Justiﬁcation of this approach is discussed in appendix.
The magnitude of the phase at point P located at the distance x′ from z′
axis in ﬁgure 1(b) corresponds to optical path (AB) between planes Σ1 and
Σ2 in ﬁgure 1(a). The optical phases between planes Σ1 and Σ2 in ﬁgure
1(a), introduced by the surrounding, the cladding, and the core at diﬀerent
distances from z′ axis, can be expressed as follows

The intensity at point Q in ﬁgure 1(b) is given by

I = U(Q)U ∗(Q).

(12)

Dividing the latter by the intensity at point Q in the absence of the ﬁber
we get the normalized intensity and plotting the latter versus x we get the
normalized intensity distribution across the Fresnel diﬀraction pattern.

Since the problem is to ﬁnd the core index proﬁle from the experimen-
tal intensity distribution on Fresnel diﬀraction of a ﬁber, we check the ap-
proach by some simulations. First, for a step index ﬁber characterized by
2a = 50µm, 2b = 125µm, nCl = 1.4580, and nCo = 1.4780, held in air, us-
ing equations (10) and (12) we plot the intensity distribution on a screen at

the distance z′ = 20mm from the ﬁber, ﬁgure 2(a). Then, assuming ϕCo is
unknown, by iteration technique we evaluate ϕCo from the intensity distri-
bution and plot it, ﬁgure 2(b). From the latter plot and the second equation
in equation (2) the required index nCo is obtained. The obtained value,
nCo = 1.479
.001 is practically the same as that used for intensity calcula-
tions. In ﬁgures 3(a) and (b) the intensity and core phase ϕCo are simulated
for the same ﬁber but, immersed in water. For this case nCo = 1.4780
.0008
is obtained, which is quite satisfactory. In another simulation we changed
the ﬁber to screen distance in the ﬁrst example from 20mm to 25mm. The
corresponding normalized intensity distribution and core phase are plotted
in ﬁgures 4(a) and (b). Comparing these plots with the corresponding plots
in ﬁgures 2, the diﬀerences can be appreciated clearly, but both core phases
yield, practically, the same core refractive index.

2.2 Graded index ﬁber

Now, we consider a graded index ﬁber with the following core index proﬁle[11]

n(x′, y′) = n0(1

∆

r′
a2 ),

−

where, n0 is the refractive index at the core center, ∆ is a constant, a is the
radius of the core, and r′ is the distance from the ﬁber axis. Considering
ﬁgure 5 the optical path length (OP L) for a ray traversing the core at the
distance x′ from the axis is

OP L(x′) =

n(x′, y′)dy′,

The complex amplitude of the diﬀracted wave at a given point on the
screen can be calculated from equation (6) provided that in the third integral

ϕCo obtained from the intensity distribution for a graded index ﬁber are
plotted in ﬁgures 6(a) and (b)(solid curve), respectively. For calculation of
the intensity distribution equation (13) is used as the core refractive index
proﬁle. The numerical speciﬁcations of the ﬁber are: n0 = 1.4707, ∆ =
0.01, nCl = 1.456, 2a = 50µm, 2b = 125µm, and the ﬁber-screen distance
is 20mm. The dashed curve in ﬁgure 6(b) is the core phase proﬁle of a
step index ﬁber of the similar cladding, but of core index 1.4707 plotted for
comparison.

Finally, to show sensitivity of the normalized intensity distribution to the
refractive index change and the eﬀect of the reducing the refractive index dif-
ference between the cladding and the ﬁber surrounding medium, the follow-
ing simulations are carried out. The intensity distributions on the diﬀraction
pattern of light diﬀracted from two step index ﬁbers which diﬀer only in their
nCl = .002 are plotted when held in air, ﬁgures
core refractive index by nCo
7(a) and (b), and immersed in water ﬁgures 7(c) and (d). The speciﬁcations
of the ﬁbers are: 2b = 125µm, 2a = 40µm, nCl1 = 1.457, nCo1 = 1.467,
nCo2 = 1.469, and ﬁber to screen distance is 18mm. Comparing the plots in
ﬁgures 7(a) and (b) one can appreciate the diﬀerences in details, but, these
diﬀerences are more clear for the ﬁbers immersed in water. Thus, reduction
of the index diﬀerence between the cladding and the surrounding yields more
accurate results.

3 Experimental procedure and results

The experimental set up is sketched in ﬁgure 8. An expanded and collimated
He-Ne laser beam, of power 7.5mW and wavelength 632.8nm, illuminates
the optical ﬁber.

The intensity distributions are recorded before and after installing the
9µm, speciﬁed by ”sbig ST-
ﬁber, by an astronomical CCD of pixel size 9
7E”, connected to a computer . Dividing the latter by the former gives the
normalized intensity distribution on the Fresnel diﬀraction pattern. In order
to get diﬀraction patterns for diﬀerent ﬁber to CCD distances the ﬁber is
mounted on a movable platform.

×

In ﬁgure 9, a typical diﬀraction pattern of the laser beam diﬀracted from
a step index optical ﬁber and recorded by CCD is shown. The experiments
were carried out by step index single-mode and multi-mode ﬁbers held in air
and immersed in water.

Figure 13: (a) The normalized experimental intensity distribution ”dots” on
the diﬀraction pattern of a laser beam diﬀracted from a single-mode step
index ﬁber, immersed in water, for the ﬁber to CCD distance, 22mm. The
continuous curve is the best theoretically ﬁtted curve. (b) The core phase

The dots in ﬁgure 10(a) are the experimental normalized intensities on
the Fresnel diﬀraction pattern of a step index multi-mode ﬁber held in air
at the distance 23mm from the CCD. The speciﬁcations of the ﬁber are
2b = 125µm, 2a = 52µm, and nCl = 1.458. The continuous curve is the
best theoretically ﬁtted intensity distribution. The latter curve is applied
to reconstruct the core phase by iteration technique, ﬁgure 10(b). Using
the second part of equation (2), from each point of the latter curve one
can get the core index. The average core index obtained in this manner is
nCo = 1.474
0.001. This experiment was repeated for the same ﬁber, for
the ﬁber to screen distance of 29mm. The results are illustrated in ﬁgures
11(a) and (b). Superimposing the corresponding curves of ﬁgures 10 and 11,
it is noticed that for a distance change of 6mm the changes of the intensity
curves are appreciable but, the curves of the core phases coincide nicely. The
curves in ﬁgure 12(a) and (b) correspond to the previous ﬁber but immersed
in water at the ﬁber to CCD distance 27mm. The core index obtained in
this case is nCo = 1.4746
0.0008 which is slightly more precise than that
obtained for the ﬁber held in air. This means that reducing the refractive
index diﬀerence between the cladding and the surrounding medium improves
the precision of the measurement.

The graphs in ﬁgure 13(a) and (b) correspond to a single-mode ﬁber of
speciﬁcations: 2b = 125µm, 2a = 10µm, nCl = 1.458, immersed in water
at the distance 22mm from the CCD. The evaluated core index is nCo =
1.468
0.002. It seems that as the core diameter decreases the measurement
error increases. This is because the contribution of the core is reduced in the
intensity distribution on diﬀraction pattern. That is why we do not see the
eﬀect of the axial shallow region of the ﬁber on intensity distribution. We
have also checked this point by simulation, considering cylindrical hole of the
diameter 1µm around the ﬁber axis.

4 Conclusions

1. This study shows that the Fresnel diﬀraction from phase objects has
high potential in providing phase distributions. It provides large vol-
umes of reliable data in a relatively simple way.

2. The diﬀerent approaches of this study, theoretical, simulation, and ex-
perimental show that in the Fresnel diﬀraction from ﬁbers consideration

19

of the inclination factor is not necessary and paraxial approximation
leads to the satisfactory results. This could be the case in other prob-
lems.

3. This study shows that the refractive index proﬁles of the ﬁbers can be
evaluated by the Fresnel diﬀraction method in a simple, nondestructive,
and reliable way. Dealing with macroscopic size of ﬁber, relaxation of
the index matching liquid requirement, and access to a large volume of
data are the other advantages of the method.

4. According to this study, the size of the phase object,

its distance
from the observation screen and the refractive index of the surround-
ing medium are signiﬁcant parameters in the measurement precision.
In future studies the eﬀects of these parameters and their relationship
with the phase distribution will be investigated.

A

In the introduced approach we have ignored the appreciable deﬂections of the
rays traversing the ﬁber. In fact, we have considered the problem in paraxial
approximation. Now, by considering the inclination factor, the exact am-
plitude and the phase in the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ integral, we show that the
intensity distribution on the central part of the diﬀraction pattern of a par-
allel beam diﬀracted from a transparent rod is mainly due to the diﬀraction
of the lights emerging paraxially from the rod.

In ﬁgure 14, the optical path for the ray traversing path (ABCD) is

∆ = n1AB + n2BC + n1CD,

(17)

where, n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the media. Considering ﬁgure
14 one can write the corresponding phase as

we get the exact complex amplitude at point Q. Multiplying U(Q) by
U ∗(Q), the required intensity is obtained. In ﬁgure 17 the simulations of the
intensity distributions on the Fresnel diﬀraction pattern of light diﬀracted
from a transparent rod, calculated exactly (dashed line) and in paraxial ap-
proximation introduced in the text, are plotted when the rod is held in air.
As one can see the diﬀerences are negligible, so the introduced approach is
quite justiﬁed. This is because, according to Fermat’s principle, when light
diﬀracts from a rather large aperture the optical energy mainly propagates
in the direction of the wavefront phase gradient. therefore, contribution to
other directions is negligible.

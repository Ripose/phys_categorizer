The ﬁeld energy distributions and eﬀective mode areas of silica-based pho-

tonic bandgap ﬁbers with a honeycomb airhole structure in the cladding and

an extra airhole deﬁning the core are investigated. We present a generaliza-

tion of the common eﬀective area deﬁnition, suitable for the problem at hand,

and compare the results for the photonic bandgap ﬁbers with those of index-

guiding microstructured ﬁbers. While the majority of the ﬁeld energy in the

honeycomb photonic bandgap ﬁbers is found to reside in the silica, a sub-

stantial fraction (up to

30 %) can be located in the airholes. This property

∼

may show such ﬁbers particularly interesting for sensor applications, especially

those based on nonlinear eﬀects or interaction with other structures (e.g. Bragg

gratings) in the glass.

Introduction

Photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs), which guide light in a single-material structure by

coherent scattering from an array of µm-sized airholes (for recent reviews we refer

to Refs. 1, 2 and references therein), have in recent years emerged as an attractive

alternative to conventional optical ﬁbers within the area of nonlinear ﬁber devices.3, 4

The advantages of the PCFs are ﬁrstly that very small mode areas can be obtained

due to the large refractive index contrast between silica and air, leading to high

nonlinearity coeﬃcients. Secondly, the PCFs allow for a more ﬂexible tailoring of

the dispersion properties, which are crucial for many applications. PCFs with zero-

dispersion wavelengths ranging from 565 to 1550 nm and high nonlinearity coeﬃcients

have been demonstrated.5, 6

The highly nonlinear PCFs fabricated today are of the index-guiding type,7 in

which a missing hole in a triangular lattice of airholes deﬁnes a high-index core, which

guides light by total internal reﬂection. Fibers guiding light in large hollow cores by

means of the photonic band gap (PBG) eﬀect have also been demonstrated,8 with the

intention of obtaining very low losses and nonlinearities. However, an alternative PBG

ﬁber design in which a honeycomb airhole lattice is modiﬁed by addition of an airhole

to form a low-index core region9 has until now not been investigated thoroughly

although its practical feasibility was demonstrated as early as 1998.10 The design is

shown in Fig. 1, and can be characterised by three parameters: The physical distance

between nearest-neighbor airholes (commonly denoted the pitch, or Λ), the diameter

of the cladding holes, dcl, and the diameter of the hole forming the core defect, dc.

2

These ﬁbers guide the majority of the light in silica, just as the conventional index-

guiding PCFs, and may, therefore, constitute an alternative way of fabricating highly

nonlinear ﬁbers. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the design depicted

in Fig. 1 with respect to ﬁeld energy distribution and nonlinear coeﬃcients. It will

be shown that nonlinearities comparable to those obtained in index-guiding PCFs

can be achieved in the honeycomb PBG ﬁbers, while at the same time, a substantial

fraction of the ﬁeld energy may be pushed into the airholes. This may make these

ﬁbers particularly interesting for applications as sensing devices.11, 12

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe our theoretical

methods, and derive a generalized formula for the ﬁber nonlinearity coeﬃcient, in

terms of an eﬀective area, which is valid for all ﬁeld distributions, including those

where a substantial part of the ﬁeld energy resides in air. In Sect. 3, we present and

discuss our numerical results for some selected honeycomb designs, and compare them

to results for index-guiding PCFs. Finally, Sect. 4 summarizes our conclusions.

2. Theoretical approach

We consider a structure, which is uniform along the z-axis while structured in the

x-y plane. The magnetic ﬁeld vector, H, may then be written:

for a monochromatic wave. The fundamental equation for H is:

H(r) = ei(ωt−βz)H(x, y),

where ε(r) = ε0εr(r) is the dielectric function. For a ﬁxed propagation constant, β, this

equation may be solved for ω, which can then be regarded as a function of β and ε(r).

From the magnetic ﬁeld vector, the corresponding electric ﬁeld is straightforwardly

obtained using Amperes law (SI units are used throughout the paper):

H = iωεE

∇ ×

The eﬀective area is a concept originating in the theory of third-order nonlin-

earity eﬀects in optical waveguides.13 In a homogeneous material, such as amorphous

silica, the third-order part of the nonlinear susceptibility gives rise to an amplitude

dependent shift in the material refractive index:

n = n0 + ∆n = n1 + n2 |

E

|

where n1 is the refractive index of silica in the limit of zero ﬁeld, and n2 is a nonlinear

coeﬃcient related to the nonlinear-susceptibility tensor, χ(3), through:13

n2 =

In an optical ﬁber, the change in material index leads to a corresponding change

in the eﬀective index (neﬀ = β

ω ). In ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, the mode-ﬁeld

distribution can be considered unchanged by the index perturbation, and the change

in ω for a (Kerr-induced) ∆ε for ﬁxed β is from Eq. (2) found to be:

Usually, the experimental situation is that light is launched at a ﬁxed frequency

ω0 and the Kerr-induced change in refractive index eﬀects a change in the propagation

constant β from β0, say, to β0 + ∆β. ∆β is then determined by:

ω(β0 + ∆β) + ∆ω = ω0, ω(β0) = ω0.

(8)

Here, ω(β) is the relation between ω and β in the absence of the Kerr eﬀect, and we

have neglected the change in ∆ω arising from the shift in β, assuming that both ∆ω

and ∆β are small. We can then obtain ∆β by linear expansion:

Here, v0

g is the waveguide group velocity in the absence of material dispersion eﬀects

(since we consider propagation at a ﬁxed frequency, the frequency dependence of ε

should not be taken into account when evaluating ∂ω

∂β ). The change in neﬀ arising from

the Kerr eﬀect is then:

where, in the last equality, the inner product of H with itself has been rewritten

using Eq. (2) and (4). The integral is taken over the xy-plane. Note that, for a

microstructured ﬁber, n1, n2 are position-dependent quantities.

In the case of ordinary silica ﬁbers, the parameters n1, n2 have little variation

over the ﬁber cross section, and it is common practice to express the Kerr-induced

change in the guided-mode eﬀective index as:

∆neﬀ = P

where P is the power launched into the ﬁber, nP

2 = n2

n1ε0c and Aeﬀ is the eﬀective

mode area. In a microstructured ﬁber, both n1 and n2 can have a strong position

dependence, and a generalization of Eq. (13) is not straightforward. However, in the

case where n1, n2 are piecewise constant functions, taking on N diﬀerent values over

the ﬁber cross section, we can modify the above deﬁnition to:

∆neﬀ = P

In the present paper, we shall only be concerned with the case of pure silica/air

ﬁbers, in which n1, n2 are equal to 1 and 0, respectively, in the air regions while having

the values appropriate for silica in the rest of the transverse plane. In this case, the

nonlinear coeﬃcient will be entirely determined by the eﬀective area relating to the

The values for n1, n2 are now understood to be those of pure silica.

At this point, two comments are in order: Firstly, note that of the two n1 factors

in the denominator of Eq. (18), one comes from the deﬁnition of nP

2 in terms of n2,

whereas the other one comes from the fundamental wave equation. Therefore, if one

uses a table value of nP

2 derived with a n1 diﬀerent from that at which experiments

are done, it may be necessary to use two diﬀerent n1 values in the product. Secondly,

Eq. (18) diﬀers somewhat from the formula commonly used for Aeﬀ , namely:

Thus, the commonly used formula (19) appears as a limiting case of the more

general result (18). The approximations leading from Eq. (18) to (19) are reasonably

well fulﬁlled in standard ﬁbers and in most index-guiding PCFs. This is, however, not

the case for the ﬁber designs examined in the present work. In Fig. 2 we show the

relative diﬀerence between the Aeﬀ deﬁnitions in Eqs. (18),(19) deﬁned as:

∆Aeﬀ = Aeﬀ −

˜Aeﬀ

(21)

with Aeﬀ , ˜Aeﬀ given by Eqs. (18), (19) respectively. The diﬀerences have been calcu-

lated for some ﬁbers designed to have a substantial part of the ﬁeld energy in air, as

discussed in the next section. It is evident that diﬀerences of 10-20% between the two

deﬁnitions can easily occur. Also, the diﬀerence varies in both sign and magnitude

over the transmission window of the ﬁbers, so that no simple scaling rule between the

two deﬁnitions can be extracted.

In this work, we solve Eq. (2) by expanding the magnetic ﬁeld and the dielectric

function in plane waves, using a freely available software package.15 Eq. (4) can be

used to derive the electric ﬁeld vector from the magnetic, and the eﬀective area can

then be found from Eq. (18). Since it is important for many applications of nonlinear

eﬀects to be close to a wavelength at which the group velocity dispersion is zero,

8

we have also investigated the dispersion properties of the ﬁbers. In order to scan a

range of physical pitches eﬃciently we have used a recently developed perturbative

approach to the inclusion of material dispersion eﬀects.16 We have found this scheme

to be both eﬃcient and accurate in the case of silica/air microstructured ﬁbers.

3. Numerical results and discussion

In the present investigation, we will primarily focus on structures with d

Λ lying in

the interval between 0.3 and 0.8 for both core and cladding holes. Such structures

are by now routinely fabricated by fusing and drawing hand-stacked capillary tubes

and rods of silica. However, in order to investigate the limitations of the hole-defect

honeycomb PBG ﬁbers, we have also studied a design with dcl

Λ =0.95 and dc

Λ in the

range between 0.1 and 0.3. Results for dc

Λ =0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 are shown in Fig. 3. The

lowest value of Aeﬀ is 0.76λ2 and is obtained for dc

Λ =0.2. The occurence of a minimum

Aeﬀ as a function of core hole diameter can be understood as follows: Since nonlinear

eﬀects only occur in the silica part of the ﬁber, reduction of core hole size increase

the region of integration in the denominator of Eq. (18), thereby acting to decrease

the eﬀective area. On the other hand, as is evident from Fig. 3, reduction of the core

hole size also decreases the values of λ

Λ , where the guided mode becomes localized.

In other words, the ﬁber dimensions becomes larger relative to the wavelength of the

guided mode, and this acts to increase the eﬀective area, when measured relative to

λ2.

In the case of index-guiding PCFs, eﬀective areas as low as 1.7 µm2 at a wave-

length of 1.55 µm have been reported experimentally, corresponding to Aeﬀ ∼

0.75λ2.

9

The minimal mode area that can be obtained in a silica rod in air has been proposed

as a theoretical lower limit on the eﬀective area in silica-based index-guiding ﬁbers,

and has been found to be 1.48 µm2 at 1.55 µm (or 0.62λ2).17 Thus, in spite of the

fact that the guided mode is localized around an airhole in the honeycomb structures

considered here they are able to obtain mode areas, which are only slightly larger

than what is possible in index-guiding PCFs.

In Fig. 4 we show the eﬀective area as a function of wavelength for dcl

Λ =0.56,

0.68 and 0.80, and dc

Λ around 0.3-0.5. It can be seen that Aeﬀ ∼
obtained, and that the minimal area decreases with increasing size of the cladding

3λ2 is readily

1.5

−

holes and increases for increasing size of the core hole.

In many experiments involving nonlinear eﬀects it is important to work at a

wavelength at which the chromatic dispersion of the ﬁber is close to zero. In these

situations, it is the minimal eﬀective area obtainable at a given wavelength, under

the condition that the dispersion coeﬃcient be zero, which is of interest. Both index-

and PBG-guiding PCFs can have complicated dispersion curves with several zero-

dispersion points. Some examples of what can be achieved with the honeycomb design

for dcl

Λ =0.68 are shown in Fig. 5. Following the three curves with dc/dcl=0.45 it can be

seen that the zero-dispersion point can have a discontinuous behaviour as a function

of Λ. The curve for dc/dcl=0.55 is an example of a ﬁber with several dispersion zeros.

To investigate the eﬀective area at the zero-dispersion point we have chosen to focus

on the longest zero-dispersion wavelength for a given design, since this is where one

will usually have the smallest eﬀective area relative to the wavelength of the light.

For the PBG ﬁber we have, therefore, investigated the location of the longest zero-

10

dispersion wavelength, λ0 over a range of physical ﬁber dimensions from √3Λ=1.5 to

5 µm. In Fig. 6 we report λ0 versus the physical pitch, Λ, and in Fig. 7 the eﬀective

area at λ0 is plotted versus λ0. Broken curves indicate a discontinuity in λ0 as a

function of Λ. In some cases, the zero-dispersion wavelength can sweep over the same

frequency several times as Λ is varied, which is why some of the curves in Fig. 7 are

multi-valued. Generally, the honeycomb ﬁbers tend to have dispersion zeros falling in

the range between 0.8 and 2 µm.

For comparison we have also considered index-guiding PCFs with a triangular

array of airholes constituting the cladding and a core-defect formed by a missing air

hole. For air hole diameters d

0.45Λ) this class of PCFs is endlessly

d∗ (with d∗

≤

∼

single mode7 and by scaling the pitch both large-mode area PCFs as well as small-core

non-linear PCFs can be formed. In addition to the mode-size the dispersion properties

may also be engineered. In the top panel of Fig. 8 we show the zero-dispersion wave-

length λ0 as a function of the pitch Λ for 5 hole diameters. Depending on the pitch the

PCF may have none, one, or two (or even three if also considering the near-infrared

regime) dispersion zeros. For the situation with two dispersion zeros it is seen that the

second dispersion zero (counting from the short wavelength limit) depends strongly

on both the pitch and the hole diameter whereas for the ﬁrst dispersion zero the

dependence on hole diameter dominates over the much weaker dependence on pitch.

One of the exciting properties of these PCFs is that by increasing the hole diameter

the lowest dispersion zero can be moved toward the visible regime. In the lower panel

of Fig. 8 we show the eﬀective area versus zero-dispersion wavelength. In general we

ﬁnd that when the hole size is increased the mode becomes more tightly conﬁned

11

with a smaller eﬀective area. The plot also illustrates a highly desired property; when

shifting the ﬁrst dispersion-zero toward the visible the eﬀective area also decreases

so that the intensity thresholds for various non-linear phenomena also decreases. We

note that the ﬁrst dispersion zero may be moved to the visible and the eﬀective area

may be decreased by further increasing the air hole diameter (so that d > d∗), but

then care must be taken that the PCF remain single-mode near the dispersion zero.

Comparing Figs. 7 and 8 it can be seen that the honeycomb PBG ﬁbers inves-

tigated here do not oﬀer substantially improved ﬂexibility in the tailoring of mode

areas and dispersion properties compared to the index-guiding PCFs. The PBG de-

signs with large cladding holes do seem to oﬀer smaller mode areas at the longer values

of λ0 but this could also be obtained in index-guiding PCFs by increasing the size

of the airholes, thereby going further out of the endlessly single-mode regime. Deter-

mining the single-mode regime for PBG ﬁbers with large cladding airholes is diﬃcult

due to the appearance of multiple bandgaps even at relatively long values of λ

Λ . For

the ﬁbers with dcl

Λ =0.8 we have found that a guided second-order mode is present

at λ0 over most of the Λ range investigated. For the ﬁbers with smaller values of dcl
Λ

the second-order modes mostly appears at wavelengths shorter than λ0 for Λ-values

smaller than

2 µm meaning that a useful range of λ0 values without second-order

∼

mode guidance is available. We have not, however, checked for the presence of guided

modes in higher-order gaps.

One interesting feature of the honeycomb PBG design compared to the index-

guiding PCFs is that a relatively large fraction of the ﬁeld energy resides in the airholes

of the ﬁber. This is illustrated in Fig. 9, where the fraction of electric ﬁeld energy

12

present in air has been plotted for the ﬁber designs discussed above. It is evident that

energy fractions of 10-15% in air are readily obtained, even for holes of moderate size,

and that the fraction increases with increasing size of the core hole defect. To estimate

the range of energy distributions accessible, we have investigated some designs, in

which the core hole defect has been further enlarged. In Fig. 10, we show results for

eﬀective areas and the energy fraction in air for ﬁbers with dc

Λ around 0.6 and varying

size of the cladding holes. It can be seen that the energy fraction in air can be as large

as 30%, while still having a range of possible zero-dispersion wavelengths and fairly

small mode areas. Further increase of dc does not push appreciably more ﬁeld energy

into the airholes, however, the transmission windows and accessible zero-dispersion

ranges are quickly diminished. The somewhat counterintuitive fact that the that the

minimum of the eﬀective area curves (i.e., the maximum of the nonlinear coeﬃcient at

a particular wavelength) occurs approximately at the same λ

Λ values as the maximum

of the energy fraction in the airholes is due to the fact that the energy fraction in air

is high at long wavelengths, where the ﬁber size relative to wavelength is small.

In Fig. 11 we show some radial mode proﬁles obtained by integrating the electric

ﬁeld energy density over the angular coordinate in a polar coordinate system around

the core center. The curves are calculated for ﬁbers with dcl

Λ =0.8 and varying size

of the core hole, and have been normalized so that their radial integral is unity. The

wavelength has been chosen so as to maximize the fraction of ﬁeld energy in air.

Only 5-10% of the ﬁeld energy is present in the central hole deﬁning the core. This

shows that the increase in the energy fraction present in air for increasing dc

Λ is not

so much due to the ﬁeld energy being pushed into the central core hole, but rather

13

to an increase of the ﬁeld energy present in the cladding region as is also evident

from Fig. 11. The presence of a substantial part of the ﬁeld energy in air not only

inﬂuences the integrals in Eq. (18), but also makes the group velocity of the guided

mode deviate substantially from the material refractive index, thus inﬂuencing the

prefactor

. In Fig. 12, this fraction is depicted for the designs with dcl

Λ =0.8. Its

2

n1

g

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

importance for a correct evaluation of the eﬀective area in these structures is evident.

The power fraction in air (which is not completely equivalent to the quantity

calculated here) for index-guiding PCFs was investigated by Monro and co-workers18

who found that large airhole diameters and λ

Λ -values were needed to obtain appre-

ciable power fractions in air. In Fig. 13, we report the fraction of ﬁeld energy in air

for some index-guiding PCFs with the same cladding structure as those discussed

above but somewhat larger airholes. Comparing Figs. 9 and 10 with Fig. 13 it is

evident that the λ/Λ values needed to push a given fraction of ﬁeld energy into the

air region are considerably larger in the index-guiding ﬁbers, calling for smaller values

of the physical pitch for operation at a given wavelength. This may make the honey-

comb ﬁbers particularly relevant for evanescent ﬁeld devices,11, 12 such as gas sensors,

based on interactions with the glass, through, e.g., nonlinear eﬀects or inscribed Bragg

gratings.

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have investigated the ﬁeld energy distribution and nonlinear coef-

ﬁcients of honeycomb photonic bandgap ﬁbers and compared them to index-guiding

photonic crystal ﬁbers with a cladding structure consisting of a triangular array of

14

airholes. A generalized concept of eﬀective mode area, which is adequate for the treat-

ment of ﬁbers with a substantial part of the ﬁeld energy present in the airholes, has

been derived for this purpose. While the honeycomb ﬁbers do not seem to oﬀer in-

creased ﬂexibility in the design of dispersion properties and mode areas they do oﬀer

the same possibilities as the index-guiding ﬁbers, at wavelengths above

1 µm. In

∼

addition, the honeycomb ﬁbers have a larger fraction of the ﬁeld energy present in the

airholes which may make these ﬁbers particularly interesting for sensor applications

based on interactions with the glass, through e.g. nonlinear eﬀects and/or inscribed

Bragg gratings.

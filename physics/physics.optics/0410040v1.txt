We present a new method to measure the guided, radiated and total decay rates in one-dimensional waveguides.
It is also theoretically shown that large modiﬁcations of the total decay rate can be achieved in realistic EDFAs
and EDWAs with eﬀective mode area radii smaller than ≈ 1µm.

It is well-known that the spontaneous decay rates of
emitting sources such as atoms or quantum wells can
be largely modiﬁed in optical micro-cavities.1 − 4 Con-
trolled spontaneous-emission plays a key role in a new
generation of micro and nano-optical devices. High-
performance micro-cavity lasers, for instance, have been
already experimentally demonstrated.5, 6 Spontaneous
decay rates modiﬁcations are also expected to impact
the performance of optical waveguide ampliﬁers as the
guided mode area radii of these devices become smaller
than ≈ 1µm.7, 8 In order to characterize one dimensional
nano- and micro-optical devices one key decomposition
of the total decay rate (τ −1
) into two components was in-
troduced in Refs. [3, 4]. The decay rate was divided into
the guided modes (τ −1
) and into the radiated modes
0 = τ −1
(τ −1
. In
r
contrast to large devices, where just the total decay rate
must be considered for their characterization, the model-
ing of nano- and micro-optical devices requires the mea-
sure of both components of the decay rate. The classical
method to determine the spontaneous decay rate of an
emitting source embedded in a one-dimensional waveg-
uide consists in the measure of the exponential decay
rate of the Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission (ASE) out-
put power when the pump source is switched oﬀ.9 The
spontaneous decay rate is given by the exponential decay
coeﬃcient of the ASE output power.

Two natural questions arise here:(1) How can τg and
τr be measured? (2) What is actually measured when
using the classical method to determine the spontaneous
decay rate? In this Letter we answer these two questions.
We show that the classical method to measure τ0 in one
dimensional waveguides gives τr if used in long length
waveguides and actually τ0 in short waveguides (assum-
ing no reﬂections at the waveguide ends). We also show
how these measures are modiﬁed in lossy mediums, i. e.,
when a background loss coeﬃcient is incorporated into

the rate and propagation equations. Then we show how
these ideas are useful on devices of practical interests.
Three cases are considered: Erbium Doped Waveguide
and Fiber Ampliﬁers (EDWAs and EDFAs) and Semi-
conductor Optical Ampliﬁers (SOAs).

Theory: decay rate measures and background loss in-
ﬂuence. We employ the analytical solution for the lon-
gitudinal z dependence of the rate equations presented
in Ref. [8] to investigate the measure of the spontaneous
decay rate in one dimensional waveguides. The analyti-
cal solution presented there is valid only for waveguides
in which the excited state population of the emitting
source, N2(z), is constant along the ﬁber. Since the mea-
sure of the decay rate is performed when N2 → 0 along
z, this approximation is valid when measuring τ0. The
rate equation is:8

where N1 + N2 = 1 are the normalized population of the

spontaneous lifetime of the upper level, ρ is the number
density of active ions, S is the doped region area, and
αn and γn are the absorption and gain constants. The
propagation equation is:

Measuring the decay rate. In the classical method9 to
determine the spontaneous decay rate, the input power
is turned oﬀ (P in
n (t) = 0) and the useful data is collected
when the concentration of excited ions is low (N2 ≪ 1).
With these two conditions Eqs. (3) and (7) become:

where we introduce the eﬀective background loss coeﬃ-
cient for the nth mode βn = αloss/(αn + αloss). Look-
ing at Eq. (8), which is linear in N2(t), we see that the
right hand side of Eq. (10) is also linear in N2(t). There-
fore, it can be rewritten as dN2(t)/dt = −N2(t)/τm,
where τm is what is actually measured by the classical
method and not τ0. Since τm is quite cumbersome, we
do not explictly write it here. But two limiting cases de-
serve a detailed study. Case 1: short length waveguides.

In this case L ≪ 1 (a weaker equivalent condition is
(αn + αloss)L ≪ 1). With this approximation Eq. (10)
reduces to

dN2(t)

(11)

This result shows that only for short length waveg-
uides the classical method9 furnishes the total sponta-
neous decay rate of the ion. It is interesting to note that
Eq. (11) is valid whether or not we have background loss
(αloss 6= 0). Case 2: long length waveguides. Here L ≫ 1
(a weaker equivalent condition is (αn + αloss)L ≫ 1).

The fact that the guided decay rate in a given mode
can be written as τ −1
gn = 2γn∆ν/ρS is pointed out here
for the ﬁrst time. It arises naturally from the interpreta-
tion given in Ref. [8] for this term as being the photons
captured by the guided modes per unit time. In contrast
to Ref. [3], in which the guided decay rate is given as a
function of the dipole moment matrix element between
the emitting source excited and ground states, we use
here the easily measurable gain constant γn.

Therefore, the total (τ −1

0 ) and the radiated (τ −1

) de-
cay rates in a given one-dimensional waveguide can, in
principle, be measured separately employing two diﬀer-
ent waveguide lengths. The guided decay rate can also
be determined by simply subtracting the later from the
former (τ −1
). Anyway, the guided decay
rate is also easily obtained from the waveguide intrinsic
parameters, as discussed in the previous paragraph.

We observe that in Ref. [8], Section 3.2.b, the results
above were outlined for αloss = 0. But now we explicitly
perform the calculations and reinterpret these results in
light of the decomposition of the decay rate into guided
and radiated modes.

and τ −1

Simulations. We end this letter studying waveguide
lengths range at which τ −1
can be measured.
We use three sets of parameters of practical interest.
They represent typical EDFAs, EDWAs, and SOAs. It
is worth mentioning that the term proportional to N 2
2 ,
which is usually included in the modelling of EDWAs
and SOAs, can be neglected since N2 ≪ 1.

r

EDFAs and EDWAs. In usual EDFAs and EDWAs,
with optical mode areas larger than ≈ 1µm2, the guided
decay rate is negligible and the total lifetime is equal to
the radiated lifetime (τ0 ≈ τr ≈ 10ms). However, when
the optical mode area becomes smaller, the guided de-
cay rate starts to have a non-negligible and measurable

2

value. For instance, using the parameters shown in Table
1, a 1µm optical mode radius, and Eq. (10), we deter-
mine the measured lifetime as a function of the waveg-
uide length for typical EDFAs and EDWAs (assuming
perfect detection). Without loss of generality, we use an
eﬀective gain and absorption constant along the total
transition bandwidth of ≈ 15T hz centered at 1.55µm.

Fig. 1. Simulations of the measured lifetimes as a function of
the waveguide length for typical EDFAs (a) and EDWAs (b). The
black lines are for non-lossy waveguides and the light grey ones for
αloss = 0.3dB/m (EDFAs)11 and 1dB/cm (EDWAs),10 typical of
ﬂuorozirconate EDFAs and silica based EDWAs, respectively.

We observe in Fig. 1 that a 1µm optical mode radius is
small enough to cause a variation of ≈ 5% between the
total and the radiated lifetimes, measured at small and
large waveguide lengths, respectively. Although small, an
optical mode radius of ≈ 1µm is already commercially
available in Photonic Crystal Fibers. Moreover, it has
been shown that waveguides with high index-contrast
(and, consequently, small mode areas) have several ad-
vantages,12 which envisages the future construction of
very-small mode area devices. To study how the total
and radiated decay rates can be measured in such de-
vices, we perform simulations assuming the values shown
in Table 1 for an EDWA, but an optical mode area of
0.02µm2, which was obtained, for instance, in Ref. [6].
The results are shown in Fig. 2. Of course, such highly-
conﬁned EDWA would use materials which will not nec-
essarily have the parameters shown in Table 1. But the
graphic in Fig. 2 is illustrative of the eﬀects that would
always occur at smaller mode areas: the diﬀerence be-
tween the total and the radiated lifetime increases (as a
consequence of larger guided decay rate), the diﬀerence

3

between the decay rates in lossy and non-lossy waveg-
uides increases, and, at last, the waveguide lengths to
obtain the radiated lifetime with a given accuracy also
increases.

SOAs. In SOAs, the condition N2 + N1 = 1 does not
hold, but it is easy to show that the method here pre-
sented to measure the radiated and total lifetime also
works. We observe that γn can be written as σe
nΓρ /S,
where σe
n is the emission-crosssection at wavelength λn
and Γ is the overlap factor between the optical mode and
the doped region area.13 Then, the guided decay rate
n Γ = 2.0 × 10−16
is given by τ −1
cm2 for a typical SOA,14 we found that the guided de-
cay rate becomes comparable to the radiated decay rate
of ≈ 200ps only at optical mode radius smaller than
≈ 1nm, far from the possibilities of present technologies.

We report on design and fabrication of nano-composite metal-dielectric thin ﬁlm coatings with high re-
ﬂectance asymmetries. Applying basic dispersion engineering principles to model a broadband and large
reﬂectance asymmetry, we obtain a model dielectric function for the metamaterial ﬁlm, closely resembling
the effective permittivity of disordered metal-dielectric nano-composites. Coatings realized using disordered
nanocrystalline silver ﬁlms deposited on glass substrates conﬁrm the theoretical predictions, exhibiting sym-
metric transmittance, large reﬂectance asymmetries and a unique ﬂat reﬂectance asymmetry.

An asymmetric mirror is a planar layered optical device ex-
hibiting asymmetry in reﬂectance of light incident from either
side, while its transmittance is symmetric1. In such a system
the relations describing the energy balance are T + R1,2 +
A1,2 = 1, where T , R and A are the mirror transmittance,
reﬂectance and losses (in form of absorption as well as scat-
tering,) respectively, and the subscripts 1 and 2 specify the di-
rection of light-incidence on the mirror. Asymmetric mirrors
have recently found use in specialized Fabry-Perot interfer-
ometer systems2. To obtain such a mirror, two conditions must
hold: (i) The layered system should lack inversion symme-
try, and (ii) the structure should impart a non-unitary energy-
transformation to the beam. The latter may be achieved either
through out-of-beam scattering, or by assuring that the dielec-
tric function of at least one of the thin ﬁlms is complex, i.e.
exhibiting either absorptive losses or gain. One of the sim-
plest structures for an asymmetric mirror is a thin metal ﬁlm
on a dielectric slab, embedded in a uniform dielectric.

Asymmetric mirrors have been realized using smooth thin
metal ﬁlms on planar dielectric substrates3,4, or corrugated
metal ﬁlms (gratings)5. The optical characteristics of these
mirrors, such as reﬂectance asymmetry and the associated
bandwidth are typically constrained to a narrow range, due
to a limited choice of materials. Alternately, it is known
that precise control of the optical response can be realized in
metamaterials – artiﬁcial structures with engineered permit-
tivities. These materials may consist of disordered metallodi-
electric nanocomposites6,7 or exhibit the long range ordering
of photonic crystals8. In this Letter we show how a disordered
metal–dielectric metamaterial may be implemented to achieve
broadband and highly asymmetric optical reﬂectors.

Solving Maxwell’s equations for an electromagnetic ﬁeld
of frequency ω impinging on a thin ﬁlm of thickness d and per-
mittivity ǫf , deposited on a semi-inﬁnite substrate of permit-
tivity ǫs embedded in vacuum, we ﬁnd the reﬂectance asym-
metry may be compactly written as

It is important to understand the dependence of the re-
ﬂectance asymmetry on the optical constants of the metal
ﬁlm, and in particular its dependence on optical losses. Such
knowledge is instrumental in designing asymmetric mirrors
with controllable spectral response. Since in general the per-
mittivity of the metal is a function of frequency, a simple
closed-form expression for ∆R is not always available.
In
Fig. 1(a) we plot the reﬂectance asymmetry of a thin silver
ﬁlm on a glass substrate embedded in vacuum, calculated us-
ing experimentally tabulated values for silver10. Close exam-
ination of ∆R in Fig. 1(b) reveals frequency dependence, re-
sulting from the aforementioned material dispersion as well
as ﬁnite ﬁlm-thickness effects, while the value of ∆R in the
minimum dispersion range is only

2%.

The behavior shown in Fig. 1 is typical to most metals
which are reﬂective in the visible and near-infrared (NIR).

requires careful design of the ﬁlm’s structure and composi-
tion, yielding a dispersion-engineered metamaterial. Below
we present an example of such a design process.

We start by imposing two constraints on the mirror: (i) The

asymmetry should be large (
∼
should posses a broadband characteristic, i.e ∂ (∆R) /∂λ = 0
at a given ﬁlm thickness. To further illustrate our approach,
we select the functional form of ∆R to resemble that in
Fig. 1(a), and choose an exact crossover point for a ﬁlm thick-
ness of d = 50nm. Fig. 2(a) shows the desired asymmetry
of the thin metamaterial ﬁlm, plotted against ﬁlm thickness
over the visible and NIR range. The permittivity ǫf (λ) may
now be extracted from the expression for ∆R by simple inver-
sion. We note that in general, for a given form of ∆R, there
exists a wide range of values of d (0 < d
50nm) and ∆R
(up to
15%) for which the resulting permittivity exhibits the
general form expected for a conducting material satisfying the
causality relations.

and ǫ′′

The resulting components of the complex dielectric re-
sponse are shown in Fig. 2(b). We see that ǫ′
f is negative over
the entire visible range, implying a metallic response. We also
f increase when the crossover point is set
ﬁnd that
for lower values of d. For large enough values of ∆R (
15%)
ǫ′
f > 0 at short wavelengths, crossing over to negative values
in the mid-visible range. Comparing the desired properties of
ǫf to permittivities of noble metals, we note that (i) ǫ′′
f is sig-
niﬁcantly greater than the known values for silver, and (ii) the
effective plasma wavelength of ǫf is red-shifted with respect
to that of silver.

∼

While the desired ǫf differs from the permittivities of
known materials, a dielectric function similar to the one in
Fig. 2(b) may be achieved in a composite metal–dielectric
ﬁlm, often described by an effective medium approach. Ac-
cording to this, composite materials with spatial inhomo-
geneities of typical size much smaller than the relevant length
scale of the system (i.e. optical wavelengths) may be treated
as homogeneous on average. To ﬁnalize our design we ap-
ply the well-known Bruggemann effective medium theory
(EMT)11 to model such a metal–dielectric nano-composite
ﬁlm with a metal ﬁlling fraction p. The effective dielectric
function of this material, ǫeff is given by

where ǫm and ǫd are known dielectric functions of the metal
and the dielectric, respectively, and g = 0.68 is a constant
describing the microscopic morphology of the ﬁlm’s con-
stituents, and is also known as the depolarization factor12.
Note that since the effective optical response depends on p (for
a given choice of materials,) it should be possible to tune the
asymmetry not only with ﬁlm thickness as in Fig. 2(a) but also
through the metal ﬁlling fraction. Ultimately, this approach
allows the design of composite metal–dielectric mirrors with
broadband asymmetry.

The dashed lines in Fig. 2(b) show the results of Brugge-
mann modelling for a silver nano-composite embedded in vac-
uum. We ﬁnd that although the loss mechanisms speciﬁc to
the Bruggemann model cannot reproduce the desired ǫ′′
f , a
value of p = 0.71 yields excellent agreement with the real
part the desired permittivity.

Semi-continuous silver ﬁlms with varying ﬁlling fractions
were deposited on microscope glass slides using a modiﬁed
Tollen’s reaction13. The typical polycrystalline and discontin-
uous morphology of the silver ﬁlms achieved by this method
can be seen in the scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) in
Fig. 3. The degree of surface coverage was controlled by mon-
itoring the chemical deposition time, with reactions lasting
6 hours. The metal ﬁlling fractions ranged from
from 1
0.9 and were determined from high resolution
p
SEM data as in Fig. 3(a)-(b), using a previously developed im-
age analysis method14. Ensuing deposition all samples were
stored under inert conditions, to minimize silver oxidation.

Optical reﬂectance and transmittance spectra were col-
lected using an inverted optical microscope with a 10X ob-
jective (0.25 N.A.) whose output port was directly imaged on
the entrance slit of a 320mm focal length spectrometer. Re-
ﬂected and transmitted light signals from a tungsten-halogen
white light illuminator impinging at normal incidence on each
side of the sample were imaged onto a liquid-nitrogen-cooled
charge-coupled device. The reﬂected signals were carefully
normalized using a high-reﬂectance mirror (Newport Broad-
band SuperMirror, R
99.9%). To eliminate spurious ef-
fects from local inhomogeneities in the metal ﬁlms, the sig-
nals collected from
1000µm across the ﬁlm in each sample
were then averaged. Various degrees of reﬂectance asymme-
try were observed for ﬁlms with different silver ﬁlling frac-
tions. Nevertheless, the transmittance always remained sym-
metric, even for rough ﬁlms with high surface coverage, as
shown in Fig. 3(c)-(d). The latter indicates that the transmis-
sion symmetry is not broken by the disorder-mediated (i.e.
diffuse) scattering from the rough silver interfaces.

It is now possible to address the effect of metal ﬁlling frac-
tion on the reﬂectance asymmetry. In Fig. 4 we plot ∆R ob-
tained from 10 samples with increasing values of p. As can
be seen, both the magnitude and sign of ∆R depend strongly

and trend of ∆R, as well as for its target value of ∆R
10%.
We note that instead of plotting ∆R as function of ﬁlm thick-
ness we plot it against p, as the ﬁlling fraction can be mea-
sured with much higher accuracy than the thickness of these
rough ﬁlms. The most noticeable feature is the theoretically
predicted crossover point near p = 0.74, where the dispersion
in ∆R is minimal.

∼

Comparing the data in Fig. 4 to the model in Fig. 2(a) we
ﬁnd that the functional form of ∆R in experiment differs from
the theoretical model, especially near p = 0.6, where ∆R is
non-monotonic. This is not surprising, since EMTs such as
the Bruggemann approach used for modelling ǫf in Fig. 2(b),
while resembling the optical response of metamaterials, do
not provide a complete description of scattering at rough in-
terfaces. Whenever applying a scattering analysis such as
that leading to Eq. 1 one assumes knowledge of the scatter-
ing boundary conditions. The latter are often not known for
very rough and thin metal ﬁlms whose optical response may
be dominated by surface scattering and enhanced absorption.
Indeed, we have computed ǫf of our ﬁlms using the measured
ﬁlling fractions, but were not able to reliably reproduce the
asymmetry for most values of p.

It is now possible to utilize the effective-medium approach
to design metamaterial coatings with extended functionalities.
Loss-compensated asymmetric mirrors may be realized by in-
corporating a gain medium into the embedding matrix15. Al-
ternately, electro-active or semi-conducting embedding matri-
ces may enable implementation of these mirrors in photonic
devices, solar cells and full-color displays.

In summary, we realized strongly asymmetric mirrors us-
ing disordered nanocrystalline silver ﬁlms deposited on glass
substrates. Basic dispersion engineering principles were ap-
plied to model a broadband and large reﬂectance asymme-
try, which was then inverted to yield the effective permittiv-
ity. An effective-medium approach was then implemented to
approximate the required optical response function in a metal-
dielectric metamaterial, closely mimicking that of disordered
silver-dielectric composites. The dependence of the optical
asymmetry on metal ﬁlling fraction in the coatings was mea-
sured, demonstrating the predicted broadband characteristic.

on surface coverage. Comparing this result to the predicted
model in Fig. 2(a) yields good agreement for the general shape

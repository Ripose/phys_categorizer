Mugnai et al. [1] have reported an experiment in which microwave packets appear to travel
in air with a speed substantially greater than c, the normal speed of light in vacuum. The
packets consist of square pulses, many wavelengths in extent, which are chopped segments
of the Bessel beam

J0(ρk sinθ) expni(zk cosθ − ωt)o

(1)

moving in the z direction, where θ is a parameter around 20◦, ρ is the cylindrical radial
variable, J0 is the Bessel function, and ω = kc.

The authors found experimentally that signals moved in the z direction with speed equal

to

vexp = c/cosθ ,

(2)

a superluminal speed that they assert agrees with the group velocity derived from Eq. (1).
Putting aside the experimental result, I point out here that Eq. (2) is not correct. It

disagrees with the wave equation

which gives a group velocity

for the Bessel beam of Eq. (1). Therefore, the reported experimental result cannot be
reconciled with the Maxwell equations. If the experiment is correct, the Maxwell equations
in the laboratory system are grossly in error at microwave frequencies, independently of any
considerations of relativity theory.

Carrying out the ρ and z integrals gives δ(Kρ − kρ)(−2πi)δ ′(Kz − kz) and then carrying out
the two K integrals gives

hzit = −iZ ∂A(kz, kρ)∗

For the Bessel beam of Ref. [1], the right-hand side of Eq. (9) is equal to the constant
cosθ and so a pulse of any shape moves with group velocity equal to c cosθ and not with
the superluminal velocity given in Eq. (2). In particular, an initial delta-function pulse will
move with the same group velocity. In the absence of dispersion, the delta function will not
spread as it progresses, so the signal velocity is also equal to c cosθ.

Phase Diﬀerence Function in Coherent Temporal-spatial Region
and Uniﬁed Equations of Steady, Non-steady Interference

(Dated: July 27, 2013)

Phase diﬀerence function is established by means of phase transfer function between time domains
of source and interference point. The function reveals a necessary interrelation between outcome
of two-beam interference, source’s frequency and measured subject’s kinematic information. As
inference uniﬁed equations on steady and non-steady interference are derived. Meanwhile relevant
property and application are discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

On two beam interference, the explicit interrelationship among source’s frequency parameter, time functions of
the beams between time domains of source and interference point [1] and instantaneous outcome of the interference
constructs a necessary foundation for any two-beam interferometry’s design and interpretation of measured data. By
means of phase transfer function between time domains of source and observer [2], the accumulated phase or phase
function for either of the wave beams at any spatial point in the coherent temporal spatial region can be determined
by source’s parameter and corresponding instant. Upon the beam’s phase function in the coherent temporal-spatial
region, the phase diﬀerence function, two variables function in interference temporal-spatial region, is established.
Is the phase diﬀerence function a general interrelationship itself. From it, the uniﬁed equations on steady and non-
steady interference are inferred directly under the cases respectively. For steady interference, conventional rule on
the interference spatial distribution is a particular example of the uniﬁed equation as the two beam’s wavelengths are
same. In addition Michelson-Morley experiment result is reinterpreted with the equation. For non-steady interference
two sets of the equations are derived for diﬀerent interferometry outcomes: beat frequency and fringe’s instantaneous
displacing velocity; moreover on some of typical dynamical measurement: history of distance, velocity and acceleration
as well as source frequency property, the principle formulas are presented for application illustration.

A. Phase diﬀerence function, through phase transfer function and involved time function, reﬂects the theoretical
interrelation between outcome of two-beam interference, frequency characteristics of two autonomic wave sources,
d ˙t = ±2π and subject’s kinematic
for example, as beat equation
information involved in corresponding time function. The time function applied in phase transfer function must
R
be reversible, in most cases it is positive reversible, that is, dt
dt > 0; all inference and property of
the phase diﬀerence function can be applied in case of two autonomic wave sources, although in most cases two
coherent wave sources are derived from one by splitting. Since phase diﬀerence function is consisted of or can be
expressed by spatial frame independent physical quantities, the theoretical relation and consequent inferences
do no depend upon spatial-frame’s selection.

B. Explanation of zero fringe displacing result of Michelson-Morley experiment.

According to steady interference equation (6a) (6b), the only existing explanation for the experimental result
is phase diﬀerence at observing interference point remains same or invariable in two cases, that is, light speed
with respect to interferometer remains same in both cases.

V. CONCLUSION

Phase diﬀerence function reveals the necessary interrelation between outcome of two-beam interference, frequency
parameter of two autonomic wave sources, and concrete time function’s information aﬀected by subject kinematic
movement. Uniﬁed equation on steady and non-steady two-beam interference can be derived from the phase diﬀerence
function. Phase diﬀerence function and related inference are independent to spatial-frame’s selection or remain
invariable under frame transformation [6].

Abstract

The emission optics of a Steigerwald type electron gun is re-examined. The vir-

tual and real points of divergence, divergence angles and beam-widths of the electron

beams at diﬀerent telefocusing strength are measured in detail for ﬁrst time . Two

diﬀerent Wehnelt cylinders are used to establish a contrasting viewpoint. The orig-

inal ‘focusing’ curves measured by Braucks are reconstructed and will be explained

only through a ‘new’ interpretation which is diﬀerent from the conventional views.

While the image of the emitting surface in front of the ﬁlament is indeed telefocused

beyond the anode, the envelope of the beam does not ‘focus’ as expected. A new

model for the emission mechanism is established based on our results.

1 Introduction

An electron gun with a telefocus Wehnelt grid was ﬁrst proposed by K.H. Steigerwald in

1949[1] ( see Figure 1). The focusing properties of this design are based on the shape

of the equipotential lines inside the Wehnelt cylinder closely imitating a diverging and

a converging lens combination. The name ‘telefocusing’ follows the optical analog. A

detailed experimental veriﬁcation of the predicted property was carried out by Braucks[2].

By changing the position of the inner Wehnelt cone (a) or the size of the outer Wehnelt

opening (dw), the strength of the two electron optical lenses will vary with the ﬁelds. As

shown in Figure 2, Braucks demonstrated the telefocusing property of the Steigerwald

type gun. The focusing distances (Lq) identiﬁed with the smallest beam diameter from

the ﬁlament tip were plotted as a function of parameters dw and a for his design. Changing

the ratio dw/a, the focal length could be varied at will. An intense electron beam that is

naturally collimated without limiting apertures makes this gun very attractive for electron

diﬀraction experiment.

Several authors have applied the Steigerwald type gun in gas phase electron diﬀraction

units using counting techniques [3], [4], [5] and photographic plates(ﬁlms)[6]. To get high

count rates and keep the angular precision at the same time, it is advantageous that

the beam is intense and narrow at the intersection of the beam and the gas jet, and

the focal point of the beam is set at the entrance of the Faraday cage in the detecting

plane[7]. In the telefocusing systems, the distance between two electrodes can be varied

by the axial movement of the inner Wehnelt cone or the anode, thus allowing the focal

distance to be adjusted and beam quality to be ﬁne tuned. To investigate the eﬀect

inﬂuenced by the geometry of the lensing system, the beam proﬁle at the proximity of

the ‘focal point’ was measured and is discussed here for diﬀerent combinations of a, D,

3

and d. It has already been pointed out by Schmoranzer et al.[8], and later investigated

extensively by Schiewe et al.[9] that the sum a + D, i.e. the distance from the anode to

the ﬁlament tip, strongly aﬀects the focusing mechanism. We built a telefocus gun to

probe the optics of an electrostatic analyzer. The measured magniﬁcation factors of the

analyzer deviated signiﬁcantly from the value one would expect based on computational

simulation which was veriﬁed in several other ways. Two possibilities could account

for this: the long established telefocusing theory could be wrong, or there could be an

anomalous broadening in the analyzer that is responsible for the diﬀerences. Therefore

diagnostic measurements have been setup to re-examine the electron beam generated

from our telefocus gun, especially to ﬁnd the focal points and the beam proﬁles in their

proximity.

2 Experiments

2.1 Setup

As depicted in Figure 3, the telefocus electron gun was mounted on a movable stage which

was able to move along the viewing line of a Faraday cage, whose entrance aperture was

50 micron. Two sets of deﬂector plates were placed between the gun and Faraday cage.

The ﬁrst set of deﬂector plates (aligner) moved along with the e-gun so that the emitting

direction could be ﬁne tuned. The second set of deﬂector plates (scanner) were attached

to the detector, and a computer controlled power supply (Bertan 205B) was used to scan

the beam over the aperture to investigate the size of the beam. The intensity proﬁle of the

beam was recorded with a Keithley 616 digital electrometer connected to a P100 computer

through GPIB ports. The scans were taken at a 15mHz repetition rate. The emission

4

current from the electron gun was set to be in the range ∼ 1µA. The beam proﬁles, which

were always gaussian in shape, were measured at 5-7 diﬀerent distances, ranging from

Le =90mm to 180 mm, in order to determine the divergence angle. The size of the beam

could be determined in two diﬀerent ways. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) was

obtained by ﬁtting the proﬁle with a standard gaussian. The FWHM was compared with

directly recorded half-maximum points. The two results agreed with each other within

5%. To determine the opening angle of the electron beam, the FWHMs from diﬀerent

positions were combined to track the envelope. However, in some extreme cases the beam

proﬁle became very broad that sweeping the beam could charge up the insulator behind

the deﬂector plates. Furthermore the deﬂecting ﬁeld became inhomogeneous, introducing

additional error. To avoid this situation, we estimate the gaussian beam size by taking the

inverse of the square root of the peak intensity and then calibrating the results with the

cases where reliable scans were available. Since the peak intensity could be measured very

accurately, the above method was an excellent method for extrapolating gaussian beam

for larger beam diameters. Two diﬀerent outer Wehnelt cylinders were used to investigate

the eﬀects due to ﬁeld penetration. (A) Wehnelt had an opening of dw = 3.175cm, and

dw = 1.12cm was the value for (B) Wehnelt.

2.2 Results and Discussions

In all cases no focal points have been found. For all the adjustible range of the gun the

FWHM of the beam investigated grew linearly with the distance between the gun and the

detector (Le). 3-dimensional plots of the beam-widths measured at diﬀerent dw/a over the

range from Le = 0 to 250mm were constructed for two Wehnelt cylinders. (Figure 4, 5)

‘Point of divergence’ can be deﬁned as the point source on the symmetric axis where the

beam intersects with the zero beam-width plane. The locations of these ‘virtual sources’

5

points determine whether a real crossover appears along the beam path. Figure 6 shows

that only in section marked (c) the real crossover appears in front of the ﬁlament; whereas

in section (b), representing smaller beam-widths, the points of divergence are behind the

ﬁlament. In section (c) the divergent lens contributes most strongly. Those crossovers

should not be called ‘focuses’ as was recognized ﬁrst by Braucks and later on conﬁrmed

by Schmoranzer et al.[8]. The beam-widths in (c) are actually larger than those in (b)

along the observed distances.

It is not clear whether a crossover will appear at larger

distance as Braucks measured(Figure 2). We suspect that Schmoranzer et al.

[8],[9]

observed cuts at a ﬁxed Le value and the minimum beam-width was mistaken as ‘focal

point’ of the beam. Figure 7 shows such cuts measured at Le = 93.2mm. The origin of

the coordinate system for Le and the position of the inner Wehnelt cone is set at the front

edge of the electron gun (Figure 3). By changing the dw/a ratio in the gun, the size of

the emitting surface and the divergence angle both change. The narrowest beam-width

observed is the minimization due to the combination of both factors. In the proximity

of the gun, the size factor dominates, but in the far ﬁeld, the dispersion angle is more

important. As supported by both Figures 4 , 5 we found that while moving the detector

to larger Le value, the minimum beam-width starts from a low dw/a value then gradually

moves toward a particular dw/a value with the lowest dispersion angle. This actually

agrees with one of the features in Braucks’ original plot (Figure 2) where the dw/a values,

corresponding to increasing ‘focal lengths’ (Lq), converge at one point. To support our

argument, we inserted into Braucks’ plot our measurements, using Lq as the distance

from the ﬁlament to the detector, the minimum beam-width was achieved by tuning

dw/a. Figure 2 shows that the dw/a values actually agree with Braucks’ measurements.

Another feature we reproduced well is that the ‘density’ of the function f (Lq, dw/a) grows

at lower dw. However, the density of f in our measurement is much greater than Braucks’.

6

One possible way of explanation may come from D, the distance from the anode to the

Wehnelt cylinder. As pointed out by Schmoranzer and Schiewe, the value of (D + a) is a

good parameter in the ‘focusing’ mechanism[9]. The dw/D values in our setup were larger

than those Braucks used. That means our converging ﬁeld is stronger inside the Wehnelt

cylinder while the diverging ﬁeld is weaker. Since the spreading of Lq curves in Braucks’

plot was the result of telefocusing mechanism, it may be reasonable to link the increased

density to our stronger convergent ﬁelds.

The telefocusing lenses do exist in the Wehnelt cylinder, but a complete ray tracing

which simulates the beam emission process has never been realized as in other gun types

[10]. The general dispersion angle involved in this case is in mrad range, which is diﬃcult

to simulate; the uncertainty in the initial conditions poses a fundamental problem. A

reverse ﬁeld created by the self-biasing and the kinetic energy of the thermal electrons

deﬁnes a zero energy surface. This surface, not the ﬁlament, serves as the emitting object

in the imaging system of a telefocusing gun. The shape of this surface depends mostly

on the local symmetric mechanical design and the electron-electron interaction, but not

on the shape of the ﬁlament. This explains why the electron beams are circular while

the hair-pin ﬁlament is elongated in one direction. The emission current would increase

exponentially as a decreases however the zero energy surface grows due to a greater reverse

ﬁeld created by the self-biasing resistor, and vice versa.

In Figure 6, the point of divergence appears in front of the ﬁlament only for small

values of dw/a when a is rather large (marked as section c). For very high dw/a (section

a), the emitting surface is fully exposed to the anode and no crossover will appear. In

the intermediate dw/a range (section b) a minimum beam-width might be obtained, but

no crossover has to occur. This avoids the ‘Boersch’ eﬀect coming from the Coulom-

bic electron-electron repulsion at the crossover[11], and ensures the fact that the beam

7

divergence angle can be kept very small at high emission current.

As shown in Figure 8, it is interesting to note that in many cases the relative momen-

tum spread (δp/p) in phase space, which deﬁnes the dispersion angle α for each ray bundle

emitted from emitting surface, is smaller than the thermal broadening, αT = qkT /eV ∼
4.18 × 10−3 rad. Particularly for Wehnelt cylinder (A), the average transverse velocity of

the thermal electrons is reduced by a factor of 10 at the minimum beam-width condition.

Generally in a simpliﬁed treatment one assumes that the transverse velocity distribution

changes only little in the emission process, however this is only true for electrons leaving

the charge cloud perpendicularly. In the transverse direction, the equipotential lines of

the local reverse ﬁeld act as ﬁlters and reduce the emittance angles. It also indicates that

the angular spread of the beam envelope is mostly from the inherent thermal broadening

than from the lensing process in the gun. Therefore by using ﬁlament with lower oper-

ating temperature, e.g. barium oxide, hexaboride cathodes, beams with smaller angular

spread can be obtained.

It is noteworthy that in section (b) marked in Figure 6, the

electron would acquire highest brightness since both beam-width and dispersion angle

were minimized.

The answer to why the beam envelope created by a telefocuing electron gun does not

converge actually can be illustrated also by its optical analog. In a telescope, the remote

object is imaged upon the eye through a telefocusing mechanism. The envelope of all

the incoming light rays, traced back, is diverging as it will ultimately reach the star we

are observing. Similarly for an electron gun, it should be that the image of the emitting

surface be reconstructed remotely while the beam envelope as a whole keeps diverging.

As will be discussed in more details in the following article, the very same electron gun

with (B) Wehnelt is used to probe the imaging optics of a spherical analyzer. Two beam-

proﬁles are measured very accurately at the entrance and exit of the analyzer. Based

8

on the measurements of the beam envelope obtained in this work, and the ratio of the

two beam proﬁles, the location of the images could be deconvoluted. The position of the

image of the emitting surface at diﬀerent dw/a is shown in Figure 9 where indeed the

source to image distance (Lq) increases as the strength of the telefocusing increases(dw/a

decreases).

We propose a new model to describe the performance of a telefocus electron gun which

is illustrated in Figure 10. In case (a) the inner Wehnelt cylinder is most retracted from

the anode, the total emission is very low, and the reverse biasing ﬁeld is rather weak.

The emitting surface thus is very close to the ﬁlament and small; also a real crossover

is observed to form in the gun. These two features facilitate a small beam size at the

proximity of the gun, as shown in Figure 4. This geometry also creates the strongest

diverging ﬁelds which account for the largest imaging length measured, as shown in Figure

9. Moving the inner cylinder further out, the real crossover withdraws toward the emitting

surface. In case (b) the electron gun is on the verge of having a real crossover inside the

Wehnelt cylinder. While the total emission current is increasing, the emitting surface

begins to move out of the ﬁlament and grows in size. As the inner Wehnelt cylinder

continues to be moved forward, the strength of the converging and diverging ﬁelds adjust

accordingly. In case (c) the electron gun has the least spreading beam and correspondingly

the furthermost virtual point of divergence. Total emission current grows further, and

the larger emitting surface contributes to a wider beam-width in the proximity of the

gun compared to case (a) but produces the narrowest beam in the far ﬁeld due to its

very small angular spread. No real crossover is present anywhere in the emission process.

This relieves the energy broadening from coulombic repulsion force. As the inner Wehnelt

cylinder is further moved forward, in case (d) , the emitting surface is greatly exposed to

the anode voltage; the very weak diverging ﬁelds account for the shortest imaging length.

9

While the emission current is the greatest, the beam-width and the dispersion angle are

also greatest in this geometry. Note that in case (c) the minimum beam-width condition is

actually the interplay of the diverging and converging lenses inside the Wehnelt cylinder.

Surprisingly, by reducing the self-biasing resistor and hence increasing the total emission

current, the lensing ﬁelds do not change much. Also the growth of the emitting surface

is insigniﬁcant as veriﬁed by a small increase in the beam-width. This weak response

is caused by the very great potential gradient in the proximity of the emitting surface

which downgrades the reverse biasing ﬁelds in this situation. The lensing ﬁelds obviously

operate in larger scale and depend most critically on geometrical factors. Note that the

spreading of the beam is highly exaggerated in Figure 10 to help illustrate the emission

proﬁles. In reality, the overall beam envelopes and the singular emitting proﬁles coming

from point sources on the emitting surface very much overlap with each other.

3 Conclusion

The very small dispersion angle found in (A) Wehnelt cylinder demonstrated the superb

ability of telefocus gun to create a very narrow, well collimated and intense electron beam

with very simple design. Our new model explains the changes in the emission optics

of the Steigerwald type gun from generating focused beams to creating parallel beams.

Throughout the investigation, the emission current of the electron gun was set to ∼ 0.1µA

range to avoid complications due to Coulomb repulsion force at the emitting surface. It

was found that the positions of points of convergence stayed within 10% while the current

could be increased up to a factor of 100. Also our dw/a values in Figure 2 agreed well

to Braucks’ results although the general structures of the electron guns were diﬀerent.

These two facts point to the possibility of studying the emission optics of the telefocusing

electron gun systematically based on geometric parameters (e.g. dw/a, dw/D) in spite of

the fact that the emission surface can not be constructed reliably.

Abstract

A new deﬁnition for the electromagnetic ﬁeld velocity is proposed. The velocity de-
pends on the physical ﬁelds.

The question posed by the title of this paper is, surprisingly, not yet answered uniquely
today; not even by way of deﬁnition. According to modern assumptions the light is the
electromagnetic ﬁeld (with corresponding frequencies) and therefore it is obvious that the
answer to the posed fundamental question is not obvious.

Today the follwing deﬁnitions of the velocity of light are used [1,2]:

1) Phase velocity,
2) Group velocity,
3) Velocity of energy transport.

The deﬁnition of phase- and group velocity is based on assumptions that the electro-
magnetic wave can be characterized by the function Ψ(t, ~x), which has the following form
[1,2]

where A(~x) is the wave amplitude and g(~x) is an arbitrary real function. The phase-
velocity is deﬁned by the following formula

Ψ(t, ~x) = A(~x) cos(ωt − g(~x))

Ψ(t, ~x) =

Aω(~x) cos(ωt − gω(~x))dω,

By the above formulas it is clear that the deﬁnition of the phase- and group-velocity is
based on the assumption that the electromagnetic wave has the structure (1) (or (2)) and
its velocity does not depend on the amplitude A. Moreover, the equation which is to be
satisﬁed by Ψ, has never been clearly stated. This is, in fact, a very important point since
Ψ can satisfy the standard linear wave equation (d’Alembert equation) or, for example a
nonlinear wave equation [3]. These two cases are essentially diﬀerent and lead to principly
diﬀerent results. One should mention that the phase- and group-velocities cannot directly
be deﬁned in terms of the electromagnetic ﬁelds ~E and ~H.

The velocity of electromagnetic energy transport is deﬁned by the formula

~v2 =

~S
W

,

~S = c( ~E × ~H),

W = ~E

+ ~H

,

where ~S is the Poyting-Heaviside vector.
Formula (4) has the following disadvantage: Both E and H are invariant under the Lorentz
transformation, whereas v2 does not have this property.

The aim of the present paper is to give some new deﬁnitions of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld velocity.

If the electromagnetic ﬁeld is some enery ﬂow, then we deﬁne the velocity of such ﬂow,

in analogy with hydrodynamics [4], by the following equation

The structure and explicit form of the coeﬃcients a1, . . . , a6 is deﬁned by the demand
that equation (5) should be invariant with respect to the Poincar´e group if the ﬁelds are
transformed according to the Lorentz transformation [5].

The main advantage of (5), in comparison with (1), (2), lies in the following:

1. The velocity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is directly deﬁned by the observables ~D, ~B, ~E,

~H, ~J , and their ﬁrst derivatives.

2. For particular coeﬃcients, eq.(5) is invariant under the Poincar´e group.

3. In the case where a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = 0 and the ﬁelds ~D, ~B, ~E, ~H satisfy Maxwell’s

equation

c( ~▽ × ~H) − ~D − 4π ~J = 0,

c( ~▽ × ~E) + ~B = 0,

then the velocity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is of constant value, with

In order to use eq.(5) one should concretely deﬁne the coeﬃcients a1, . . . , a6.

The explicitly-covariant deﬁnition of electromagnetic ﬁeld velocity can be given the

Using Maxwell’s equation in vacuum, one can obtain the following formula for the velocity
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

From (7) it is clear that the velocity depends only on derivatives of the ﬁelds.
|~v| is a
conditional invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation, i.e, if ~E and ~H satisfy
the full system of Maxwell’s equations in vacuum, then |~v| would be an invariant of the
Lorentz group. In other words, the conditional invariant is a particular scalar combination
of the ﬁelds, for which the ﬁelds satisfy some equations with nontrivial solutions. Well
known invariants for the electromagnetic ﬁeld ~E · ~H and ~E2 − ~H 2 are absolute invariants
with respect to the Lorentz group.

We demonstrate the generation and weak beam control
of two-dimensional (2D) multicolored transverse arrays in a
thick quadratic nonlinear medium pumped by two spatially
overlapped and temporally synchronized femtosecond beams.
Above relatively low input fundamental pulse intensities (∼
6.7 GW/cm2), reproducible multiple ﬁlaments are induced by
small ellipticity of one of input beams, and two-dimensional
multicolored transverse arrays are launched as a result of
multiple four-wave mixing between the induced multiple ﬁla-
ments and crossly coupled fundamental and second harmonic
pulses. By seeding with weak second harmonic pulses, the
two-dimensional arrays are suppressed into one-dimensional
ones. The weak beam control is independent upon the rela-
tive phase of the second harmonic seed. This suggests a simple
but robust phase-insensitive all-optical control to switch 2D
array of strong beams with a weak seed beam, in contrast
with the requisite of a strong beam to control a weak beam
in the usual case of all-optical switching. Furthermore, the
phase-insensitive control is of practical importance, since it
provides an unusual coherent process without any necessities
to determine the phase of the signal and match it to an ap-
propriate phase of the control beam as normally required for
usual all-optical switches.

Generation of multiple ﬁlaments and soliton-like waves
during the propagation of intense wave packets is cur-
rently one of the most active areas in nonlinear optics.
The form of multiple ﬁlaments can be considered as am-
pliﬁcation of perturbations in the input beams or noise
in the nonlinear optical systems [1–13]. In the absence
of any external perturbations, the breakup of a low-noise
input wave packet is triggered and ruled by determinis-
tic wave-envelope modulation in spite of stochastic na-
ture of the input noise [14]. Deterministic multiple ﬁl-
ament patterns that are reproducible from shot to shot
have been observed for elliptical input beams propagat-
ing in water [15]. Control of multiple ﬁlaments has been
demonstrated for intense elliptical beams propagating in
air by changing the input ellipticity [16]. Stable multiple
quadratic solitons have been generated in a quadratic
nonlinear medium due to the nature anisotropy of the
medium or input beam asymmetry [17–19]. It has been
shown that the quadratic solitons could be simply con-
trolled by seeding a second harmonic (SH) beam [20].

On the other hand, one-dimensional multiple soliton-

like waves could be generated due to the spatial mod-
ulational instability in a quadratic nonlinear medium
[21]. However, the onset of 2D soliton-like waves re-
quired a quite high-intensity pump, which was obviously
limited by the damage thresholds of the nonlinear ma-
terials. A recent experiment has demonstrated that 2D
multicolored transverse arrays (MTAs) could be launched
in a quadratic nonlinear medium at relatively low in-
put fundamental-wave (FW) intensities [22], as a result
of multiple four-wave mixing between the crossly cou-
pled FW and SH pulses and the reproducible multiple
ﬁlaments induced by the small input beam asymmetry.
The observed 2D MTAs may ﬁnd interesting applications
in ultrafast photonics. For instance, a 2D array of all-
optical switches can be developed if the 2D MTAs can
be controlled with appropriate seeding pulses. As the 2D
MTAs were caused by multiple four-wave-mixings involv-
ing the reproducible multiple ﬁlaments, which could be
controlled by a weak SH seed [20], accordingly, a weak
SH seed can be used to suppress 2D MTA patterns. In
this letter, we demonstrate that 2D MTA patterns can
be switched into 1D ones by using a weak SH seeding
along one of FW input beam. The controlling process
was veriﬁed to be independent upon the relative phase
shift between the FW and the seeded SH pulses.

The experimental setup is sketched in Fig.1. A regen-
eratively ampliﬁed Ti:sapphire fs laser (Spectra-Physics,
Spitﬁre) was used to produce fundamental pumping
pulses (50 fs, 800 nm), which were split into an on-
axis beam ~k1 and slightly oﬀ-axis beam ~k2. The on-axis
~k1 laser beam was focused by a spherical concave high-
reﬂection mirror at a small fold angle, and the oﬀ-axis ~k2
fundamental beam was down-collimated with a concave
high-reﬂection mirror and a lens. Both input beams were
polarized perpendicular to ~k1 and ~k2, and were steered
to cross inside a 4mm-thick β-barium borate (BBO II,
type-I 29.18o-z cut) crystal at a variable angle (θp) with
accurate synchronization and spatial cross-overlapping,
and the BBO II crystal was placed 20 mm before the
focus point of the ~k1 beam. The beam diameters of the
pumping pulses were about 1.3 mm. The BBO II crystal
was arranged so that the on-axis ~k1 beam fulﬁlled the
type-I SH phase-matching condition.

In the presence of only the on-axis ~k1 beam, the FW
and SH pulses were observed to break up spatially into

1

stable ﬁlaments [2–13]. This was caused by the on-axis
beam ellipticity [15,16,19] due to the asymmetric focus-
ing with concave high-reﬂection at a small fold angle. For
example, at a fold angle of ∼ 12◦, the on-axis ~k1 pump
beam was focused into an elliptical beam of the spatial
proﬁle as E(x, y) = F (x2/a2+y2/b2) with e = b/a = 1.58
on the input facet of the BBO II crystal. Within the
crystal, quadratic nonlinearity brought about a stable
spatial break of the input elliptical FW beam and the
associated SH beam into two colored ﬁlaments along the
minor axis [15,16,19]. The red ﬁlament showed a quite
broad spectrum, while the spectrum of the blue one was
relatively narrow. As shown in Fig.2(a), the inner blue
ﬁlaments corresponded to the sum-frequency generation
between the on-axis ~k1 pulses and the outer red ﬁlaments.
As both the on-axis ~k1 and oﬀ-axis ~k2 beams were syn-
chronously crossed the BBO II crystal, MTAs were ob-
served at an observation screen perpendicular to ~k1. Fig-
ure 2(d) shows a typical MTA pattern observed with an
intensity ratio I~k1 /I~k2 = 17 and cross angle θp=2.75◦.
The observed patterns consisted of red and blue arrays,
denoted by R(nr, mr) and B(nb, mb), where R(nr=0,
mr=0), R(nr=1, mr=0), and R(nr = ±1, mr = 0) rep-
resent the ~k1 and ~k2 beams, and red multiple ﬁlaments,
while B(nb = 0, mb = ±1), B(nb = 0, mb = 0), and
B(nb = 1, mb = 0) represent the blue multiple ﬁla-
ments, SH of the ~k1 beam, and frequency-summed pulses
~k = ~k1 + ~k2, respectively. The onset of MTAs was crit-
ically dependent upon the pump intensity, which was
measured to be consistent with the onset of multiple ﬁl-
aments. In principle, the observed MTAs were caused by
multiple four-wave-mixings as follows. Four-wave mixing
between B(nb = 0, mb = ±1), B(nb = 0, mb = 0), and
B(nb = 1, mb = 0) generated B(nb = 1, mb = ±1), and
further multiple four-wave-mixings generated B(nb, mb)
in the observed blue MTAs [22]. Similarly, the red pat-
terns R(nr, mr) were generated by multiple four-wave-
mixings originated from R(nr = ±1, mr = 0), R(nr=0,
mr=0), and R(nr=1, mr=0) [22]. The generated repro-
ducible multiple ﬁlaments were involved in the multi-step
nonlinear couplings as novel beams.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of SH seed on the
generation of 2D MTAs, we used a straightforward ex-
perimental setup as follows. A 1mm-thick BBO crystal
(BBO I, type-I 29.18o-z cut) was placed before the 4mm-
thick BBO II crystal, which provided a weak seed SH
generation of the on-axis FW beam. The energy ratio
SH/FW of the on-axis beam before BBO II crystal was
changed by rotating the BBO I crystal to vary the phase-
matching condition. Figure 2 shows clearly the control of
multiple ﬁlaments and the corresponding MTAs by vary-
ing the input SH seed. Both red and blue ﬁlaments were
completely suppressed when the energy ratio SH/FW was
increased up to 3.6%. Correspondingly, all the red and

blue patterns R(nr 6= 0, mr) and B(nb 6= 0, mb) were
completely suppressed as a result of complete suppression
of multiple four-wave-mixings, and the 2D MTA patterns
were switched to 1D one. Even under a complete sup-
pression of red and blue multiple ﬁlaments, there still
existed coplanar nonlinear couplings between the ~k1 and
~k2) beams, which generated beams within the plane (~k1,
~k2).

To verify that the suppression of 2D MTAs was not
originated from intensity decrease of the on-axis FW
pulse, BBO I was rotated so that no SH pulses were gen-
erated and the on-axis FW pulses were attenuated by a
variable attenuator. The threshold to launch multiple ﬁl-
aments and 2D MTAs was about 6.7 GW/cm2. However,
when the 2D MTA patterns were suppressed by seeding
a weak SH pulse, the residual FW pulse intensity after
BBO I was about 15.0 GW/cm2. It clearly indicates that
the suppression of the 2D MTAs is originated from the
weak SH seed rather than intensity decrease of the FW
pulse. A detailed dependence of the 2D MTAs upon the
energy ratio SH/FW is plotted in Fig.3. The intensities
of the 2D MTA patterns decrease monotonously with the
increase of the energy ratio SH/FW. The blue patterns
could be suppressed at a smaller SH seed than the red
patterns.
It is consistent with the fact that the inner
blue ﬁlaments were generated by the frequency-summing
of the on-axis FW beam and the outer red ﬁlaments. It
is clear that the suppression of 2D MTA patterns was
accompanied with the suppression of red and blue mul-
tiple ﬁlaments. This presents an experimental evidence
that the formation of 2D patterns were originated from
four-wave mixing between input beams and the induced
multiple ﬁlaments.

To understand the intrinsic physics of the experimen-
tal observations, we performed numerical simulations.
The real experimental situations can only be simulated
by solving the (3+1)D equations for the slowly-varying
envelopes of relevant electric ﬁelds, which involves a
formidable computation task since multiple ﬁlament gen-
eration and fs pulse propagation in the quadratic non-
linear medium cannot be simulated by using cylindrical
symmetry. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated that
multiple ﬁlaments can be described successfully as a spa-
tial breakup in the frame of spatial (CW) models in spite
of the genuine spatiotemporal nature of the involved pro-
cesses [23,24]. For the sake of simplicity, we neglect in
our simulation the pulse properties of the coupled waves,
such as the group-velocity mismatch, group-velocity dis-
persion, and etc., and adopt a simpliﬁed (CW) simulation
by solving the coupled wave equations [18,20]

y stands

merical model did not represent the experimental situa-
tions, the simpliﬁed (CW) simulations qualitatively re-
produced the experimental observations with regard to
the role of input asymmetry and SH seed in the gener-
ation of multiple ﬁlaments. Figure 5(a) shows that an
additional pair of ﬁlament are generated when a small
asymmetry is assumed in the input pulses (b/a=2.0).
Then, by seeding a weak SH pulse (SH/FW=1.0 % ),
the wave break is completely suppressed and the ﬁla-
ments around the on-axis input beam disappear. As the
generation of MTAs is closely related with multiple ﬁla-
ments, suppression of multiple ﬁlaments eventually leads
to suppression of the MTA patterns out of the plane(~k1,
~k2), and thus a switch of MTAs patterns from 2D into
1D can be observed.

Interestingly, the switching of the MTA patterns from
2D to 1D is not dependent on the relative phase between
the on-axis FW and the seeded SH pulses. In the exper-
iments, as shown in Fig.1, the relative phase shift can
be changed by tilting an inserted 1mm-thick CaF2 plate.
Due to the dispersion property of the plate, the pulses
with diﬀerent carrier frequencies undergo diﬀerent eﬀec-
tive optical lengths, which introduces a relative phase
shift. As shown in Fig.5, as an example, the disappear-
ance of the ﬁlaments and 2D MTA patterns out of the
(~k1, ~k2) plane is not aﬀected as the relative phase shift
was varied from 0 to 2π by tilting the inserted thin plate.

In summary, we have demonstrated a weak beam con-
trol of 2D MTAs. By seeding a weak SH pulse, 2D MTA
patterns were switched to 1D ones, and the switching
was independent upon the SH seed phase. This may lead
to various intriguing applications in ultrafast information
processing such as all-optical multi-switches, in which a
weak beam controls an array of strong beams.

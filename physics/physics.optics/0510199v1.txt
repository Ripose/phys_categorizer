(Dated: February 20, 2014)

Using sum rules and a new dipole-free sum-over-states expression, we calculate the fundamental
limits of the dispersion of the real and imaginary parts of all electronic nonlinear-optical suscepti-
bilities. As such, these general results can be used to study any nonlinear optical phenomena at any
wavelength, making it possible to push both applications and our understanding of such processes
to the limits. These results reveal the ultimate constraints imposed by nature on our ability to
control and use light.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of

light with matter is of

importance in studying materials;[1] and,

funda-
lies
mental
at the heart of many critical technologies that span
telecommunications,[2] optical data storage,[3] three-
dimensional nano-photolithography,[4] and making new
materials[5] for novel cancer therapies.[6] Because the
strength of interaction, as quantiﬁed by the nonlinear-
optical susceptibility, governs the eﬃciency of an appli-
cation - and indeed whether or not a particular appli-
cation is practical, making materials with ever larger
nonlinear susceptibility has been the central focus of re-
search in organic nonlinear optics. Is there a fundamen-
tal limit to the susceptibility? Our work shows that
nature imposes such an upper bound. Prior work de-
termined the fundamental limit of only the oﬀ-resonant
susceptibility.[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] In the present studies,
we calculate the most general case: the fundamental lim-
its of the dispersion of the real and imaginary parts of
all electronic nonlinear-optical susceptibilities, which can
be used to study or apply any nonlinear optical phenom-
ena at any wavelength. We show below how our work
provides an understanding of the constraints imposed by
nature on our ability to control and use light, and lays
the foundation for developing better materials and novel
applications.

We focus on the second-order nonlinear-optical suscep-
tibility of a molecule, often called the hyperpolarizability
β, as an example of the process we use for ﬁnding the
fundamental limit of any nonlinear susceptibility. Fur-
thermore, since our goal is to set an upper bound, we will
only consider the largest tensor component, βxxx. The
nonlinear-optical electronic susceptibilities are calculated
using perturbation theory in the dipole approximation,
which yields an expression that incudes the excited state
properties of all the quantum states of the system. This
theoretical result is called a sum-over-states (SOS) ex-
pression, and for β is given by:[13]

state 0, D−1
nm(ωα, ωβ) gives the dispersion of β (and is
deﬁned later) and ¯hωi(i = 1, 2) are the frequencies of
the photons. The primes indicate that the ground state
is excluded from the sum and the permutation operator
Pωα,ωβ directs us to sum over all six frequency permuta-
tions given by the Feynman Diagrams. Since the dipole
moment of the molecule is proportional to the position
(px =
ex), we loosely call xnm the transition moment
and xnn the excited state dipole moment. The ﬁrst term
in Equation 1 is called the dipole term and the second
one the octupolar term.

−

Equation 1 is a function of an inﬁnite number of ma-
terial parameters, xnm and En0, so the maximum value
of β for each possible pair of photon energies requires an
optimal set of transition moments and energies. The sum
rules, which are directly derivable from the Schr¨odinger
Equation, are relationships between the transition mo-
ments and energies. In the present work, we apply the
sum rules to put the SOS expression of the nonlinear
optical susceptibilities into a form that can be maxi-
mized. We then use these results to calculate the ultimate
nonlinear-optical susceptibility.

II. THEORY

The generalized Thomas-Kuhn sum rules, derived di-
rectly from the Schr¨odinger Equation (without any ap-
proximations), relate the matrix elements and energies
to each other according to:[8]

ets implicitly accounts for the dispersion of the dipolar
contributions of all the excited states.

concentrated in at most two states when a molecule’s

limit has its . So, we us the dipole free three-level model

Having exhausted all the sum rules that meet the three

to the parameter µ10 for µ10 = −4√3µMAX .

The maximum value of βxxx at any set of wavelengths
(i.e. any value of ω1 and ω2) and for any second-order
process is determined by calculating the maximum value
of Equation 10 with respect to the parameter E for ﬁxed
value of E10 and damping factor Γn0.

III. DISCUSSION

All

second-order nonlinear optical processes are
bounded by Equation 10. Figure 1 shows the real and
imaginary parts of the maximum allowed one-electron
hyperpolarizability as a function of the energy of the
two incident photons, normalized to the maximum oﬀ-
resonant value βMAX

There are two dominant peaks in the fundamental limit
of the real part of βxxx. The electrooptic hyperpolariz-
ability, βxxx(
ω, 0, ω), peaks at just under 80 times the
oﬀ-resonant fundamental limit while the second harmonic
generation hyperpolarizability, βxxx(
2ω, ω, ω), peaks at
just under 50 times the oﬀ-resonant limit. Starting with
the single electron system with these typical excited state
energies and damping factors, the ultimate hyperpolar-
izabilities for an N -electron system is

One might be concerned that on resonance the higher-
lying states that we ignore could have large contributions
to β. At the fundamental limit, the oscillator strength is
distributed solely between the two dominant states, so,
such higher-order terms will not contribute.

At the oﬀ-resonant fundamental limit of β, the second
excited state energy is inﬁnite. Given that in most sys-
tems, the energy level spacing gets smaller for higher en-

ergy states, it is not clear how one could make a molecule
that gets near the limit. Indeed, the factor of 30 gap be-
tween the best molecules and the oﬀ-resonant limit[18]
may be partially due to this fact.

Figure 2a shows a plot of the real part of the fun-
damental limit of the resonant electrooptic hyperpolar-
izability β(0, ¯hω = E10) normalized to the oﬀ-resonant
limit (with E10 = 1eV ) as a function of E20, for vari-

ous values of ΓF W HM
. As one would expect,
20
the maximum resonant value increases as the width de-
creases. However, the hyperpolarizability peaks when the
second excited state is close in energy to the ﬁrst excited
state. In the limit of zero width, β peaks when the two
states are degenerate. Such excited state energy spacing
is common in organic molecules, so it may be possible to
identify molecules with an ultra-large resonant response
using this strategy.

This resonant result appears to be at odds with the oﬀ-
resonant result, which predicts that the best molecules
are those for which the second excited state energy is
inﬁnite. Our present calculations, in the zero-frequency

limit of β(ω, ω), are summarized by the series of plots in
Figure 2b, which show the fundamental limits for several
photon energies between 0 and 0.4 eV with a damping
factor of Γn0 = 100meV . For ¯hω = 0, the fundamental
limit clearly approaches the normalized value of unity,
as previously calculated. For each oﬀ-resonant photon
E10/2,
energy, the fundamental limit increases, as ¯hω
when the second excited state energy approaches inﬁnity;
so that for ¯hω = 0.4 eV , the fundamental limit is three
times the oﬀ-resonant case.

→

The ultimate limits in the dispersion of the real
and imaginary parts of the third-order susceptibility,
γ(ω1, ω2, ω2), can be calculated in a similar way. To do
so, we again start with the three-level model in dipole-
free form and apply it to the third-order nonlinear-optical
susceptibility,[14] which is expressed in terms of transi-
tion moments from the ground to the second excited state
and the transition moment between the ﬁrst and second
excited states. The sum rules can then be used to re-
express the results in a form analogous to Equations 10,
which depends only on a dispersion factor. A full discus-
sion of third-order susceptibilities is beyond the scope of
this work and will be presented in a future paper.

For a polar-aligned bulk material made of such molecules,
at a concentration of 1021 cm−3, the oﬀ-resonant elec-
trooptic coeﬃcient would be rMAX (0, 0) = 3, 000 pm/V
and the resonant case would yield rMAX (0, ¯hω = E10) =
24, 000 pm/V . Higher concentration systems would have
even higher values. As such, our calculations show that
there is room for improvement over today’s best materi-
als.

×

We stress that our theory is general and that few ap-
proximations have been used in calculating the disper-

4

sion of the limits. First, we have used a procedure that
recognizes that truncated sum rules are a good approxi-
mation when the oscillator strength is dominated by two
excited states. Second, we have only considered processes
that can be described by perturbation theory, a realm in
which the material response is expressed as a series in
the electric ﬁeld with the susceptibilities as coeﬃcients.
Furthermore, we have only considered the electric dipole
approximation (i.e. the wavelength of light is small com-
pared with the size of the quantum system under study
and also magnetic terms are ignored). While it is often
the case that higher-order terms or magnetic ones may
be larger than lower-order terms, the fundamental lim-
its of the higher-order terms should not be larger than
the fundamental limits of lower-order terms. Third, we
only consider the largest diagonal components of β and γ.
Short of unexpected new Physics, we would not expect
that the maximum limit of an oﬀ-diagonal component
of a susceptibility to exceed a diagonal one. Note that
our calculations include resonance, so Kleinman Symme-
try is expected to be broken, leading to potentially large
oﬀ-diagonal components of susceptibilities that are dis-
allowed oﬀ resonance. For such cases, one would need to
use oﬀ-diagonal sum rules.

In conclusion, we have recast the nonlinear suscepti-
bilities in a dipole-free form which allows us to apply the
sum rules to any complex susceptibility to calculate the
fundamental limits of the dispersion. We ﬁnd that these
results reduce to the oﬀ-resonant case that we have pre-
viously studied, and that on resonance, maximization of
the nonlinear-optical response requires a diﬀerent set of
conditions, i.e. the two excited state energies need to be
well separated in the oﬀ-resonance case, but, they need
to be closely spaced in the resonant case to reach the fun-
damental limit. Clearly, there is still room for substantial
improvements in all nonlinear molecular susceptibilities,
especially on resonance sin systems with closely-spaced
excited state, such as octupolar molecules.[19]

Imaging using nano metallic ﬁlms: from evanescent wave lens to resonant tunnelling

A thin metal slab is known to be able to focus the near ﬁelds of TM wave of a point source. Here,
we show that a thin metal slab in fact possesses a far-ﬁeld image and through a simple modiﬁcation
on the system by resonance tunneling, a double metal slab can give a bright image with both the
far-ﬁeld and the near-ﬁeld details.

Double-negative (DNG) medium, with permittivity (ǫ)
and permeability (µ) simultaneously negative, exhibits a
negative value of refractive index [1, 2] and the resulting
negative refraction has been demonstrated both numer-
ically [3] and experimentally [4, 5]. The DNG slab with
ǫ = µ =
1 is a perfect lens [2] in the sense that it
can focus all geometric beams (the far ﬁelds) of diﬀerent
directions from a point source to a real image by neg-
ative refraction and it can compensate exactly all the
evanescent waves (the near ﬁelds). The experimental re-
alization of the perfect lens is diﬃcult due to its extreme
sensitivity to the system parameters [6]. On the other
hand, if we are working in the near-ﬁeld regime for TM
waves, the condition ǫ =
1 is suﬃcient so that a thin
metallic ﬁlm acts as a near-ﬁeld lens [2, 7, 8]. However,
for the metallic ﬁlm, the position of the focal plane for
the far ﬁelds is ambiguous although it is a common prac-
tice [7, 9] to place the image plane at a distance double
the slab thickness beyond the point source. The position
of the focal plane is proposed to be determined from the
phase contour or the streamline of Poynting vector [3, 10]
but whether a far-ﬁeld image exists remains unclear.

lens, the phase of the source-to-image transfer function
can only be certain quantized values. The ǫ = µ =
1
perfect lens is a special case of the general condition. It
follows naturally from our results that a “single negative”
metallic ﬁlm can focus a point source to a far-ﬁeld im-
age. In addition, a Fabry-Perot-like cavity of two metal-
lic ﬁlms can provide both far-ﬁeld and near-ﬁeld imaging
with high transmittance. Here, a far-ﬁeld image means
the image formed by all the propagating waves and it can
be recorded (e.g. by a camera) far away from the lens.

Let us ﬁrst establish the condition for negative re-
fraction (a negative lateral shift) for a ﬂat slab of pre-
speciﬁed values of permittivity ǫ and permeability µ.
Without loss of generality, we consider TM waves. Fig. 1
shows a schematic diagram showing the situation when a
geometric beam impinges on this slab. f here is deﬁned
as the distance measured from the exit interface of the
slab when the beam returns to the z-axis and ∆x is the
lateral beam shift. For negative (positive) refraction, f is
positive (negative) and ∆x is negative (positive). Using
the stationary-phase method [11], f can be proved to be
given by

FIG. 1: A transmitted beam undergoes negative refraction
for a slab of thickness d. ∆x is the lateral beam shift. φ is
the phase change across the slab. φ0 is the phase change in
vacuum and φtot is the total phase change for the beam in
returning to the z axis.

where φ is the phase change across the slab and we use
kz(k0z) to denote the wave number in the z-direction in
the slab (vacuum). In general, f is a function of the inci-
dent angle where k0z ranges from 0 at grazing incidence
to k0 (the wave number in vacuum) at normal incidence.
Now, we search for optimal conﬁgurations such that
f is nearly independent of the incident angle (measured
by k0z). Such an optimal conﬁguration implies the slab
behaves like a lens, and the lensing condition can be re-
stated in terms of the phase change as

∂φtot (k0z)

In this paper, we take an alternative approach by con-
sidering the far-ﬁeld focusing of a thin slab with arbitrary
ǫ and µ. We show that if the slab can be regarded as a

where φtot is the total phase change when the beam re-
turns to the z-axis. We can measure how well Eq. (2) can
be satisﬁed by deﬁning an operational aberration using

which measures the deviation of f (k0z) from its para-

of a are plotted in grayscale in Fig. 2 with black color
denoting smaller values. The loci of the local minima of
a in the ǫ

focusing. Interestingly, they form bands and each band
can be characterized according to the total elapsed phase

where m is any integer and the approximation is valid
for all k0z ranging from 0 to k0. The stationary φtot is
thus quantized. In fact, the bands can be approximated
by analytic formulas. We will not prove them in details
but simply state them here. We found that there are two
scenarios that can lead to Eq. (4). The ﬁrst scenario is
given by

χ = mπ,

(5)

−

where χ is deﬁned by χ = √ǫµ
1k0d and m is an in-
teger. Eq. (5) yields the bands of φtot = mπ in the ǫ-µ
plane. These bands for a slab of d = 0.19λ are plotted as
black open circles in Fig. 2. The two bands of m = 0 cor-
respond to a transparent slab of refractive index +1 and
a DNG slab of refractive index –1. The second scenario
is given by

which yields the bands of φtot = (m + 1/2)π. These
bands are plotted as white crosses in Fig. 2. In Eq. (6),
χ can be either purely real or purely imaginary from its
deﬁnition.

−

We see that the bands of φtot = (m + 1/2)π is in gen-
eral broader than the bands of φtot = mπ (which in-
1 as a special case). The DNG lens with
cludes n =

ǫ = µ =
1 is the “best lens” since it has exactly zero
aberration, but it is also the least robust. The “poor
man’s superlens” show up as a special case as the band
φtot = π/2. Only ǫ is negative (single-negative), but the
aberration can be very small. In particular, we select the
case (ǫ, µ) = (

s1 + s2 = f where s1 (s2) is the distance of the point
source (image) from the ﬁrst (second) interface. s2 is pos-
itive (negative) for a real (virtual) image. If we denote

to the image for the lens, the image is formed due to the
phase conservation of ttot at diﬀerent incident angles and
it does not require the amplitude of ttot to be a constant.
In the current example, the amplitude varies from 0.3 at
normal incidence to 0 at grazing incidence. As the image
is formed by tunnelling, f stays nearly the same as we
increases the slab thickness (unlike the DNG slab where
f scales with the slab thickness). However, the transfer
amplitude drops exponentially with the slab thickness.

been given explicitly. Based on the optimal example, the
brightness of the image can in fact be increased to nearly
unity using an interesting property of tunnelling focus-
ing. As the slab has a mirror symmetry in the z-axis,
the reﬂection phase φr from the slab entrance interface
satisﬁes φr = φ
π/2. If we stack another slab of the
same conﬁguration at precisely one f beyond the original
slab (details shown in Fig. 3), the phase change per cycle
within the cavity is 2(φr + φ0) = 0 or 2π. It is a resonat-
ing condition satisﬁed for all incident angles, resulting
in an all-angle (or equivalently a real-space) Fabry-Perot
(FP) cavity. Moreover, a real image is formed at one f
beyond the second slab with φtot = 2 (φ + φ0) = π which
is independent of the incident angle. As an example, if
we stack two identical metal slabs with ǫ =
1.0914 and
thickness d = 0.19λ together with an air gap equal to
one f of that a single slab in between, we can form a
real image with s1 + s2 = 0.256λ. Fig. 3 illustrates the
source and the image proﬁle for this double-slab system
if we place a point source at f /2 in front of the ﬁrst
slab. Only propagating ﬁelds from the point source are
included in our calculation. The intensity at the source

−

point is normalized to one and nearly the same intensity
is found at the image. In principle, the propagating wave
transmittance is essentially unity independent of the in-
cident angle for thin slabs, but if thicker metal slabs are
employed, the transmittance of the double-slab system
becomes more sensitive to the aberration the single-slab
system.

We now consider the evanescent wave components.
Fig. 4(a) shows ttot of the same system plotted against
kx, the wave number in the transverse direction. From
kx = 0 to k0 (the propagating waves), ttot
1 for all
incident angles. Therefore, the image proﬁle for a far-
ﬁeld observer is simply (sin(k0x)/(k0x))2 as shown by
the solid line in Fig. 4(b). Therefore, for a far-ﬁeld ob-
server, the double-slab system behaves just like the DNG
perfect lens. For the near ﬁelds with kx > 1, the double-
slab system can also support surface plasmons, indicated
by the peaks shown in Fig. 4(a), and this leads to super-
resolution. The image proﬁle with the evanescent waves
included is shown by the solid line in Fig. 4(c). It has a
half-pitch resolution of 0.25λ which breaks the diﬀraction
limit. The dashed lines in Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the im-
age proﬁle if we introduce some absorption (an extra 0.1i
is added to the permittivity of the metal) into the sys-
tem. The lensing eﬀect is still retained. A double-layer
structure is currently employed for reducing the absorp-
tion in near-ﬁeld focusing in the literature [8] Our results
show that a similar system can work for the far ﬁelds as
well by tuning it into FP resonance. The image can be
transferred farther away by cascading a number of these
cavities.

In summary, we have considered the general lensing
condition for a homogeneous slab, which is found to be
discrete values of the transmission phase. For a metal
slab capable in focusing, an all-angle FP cavity can be
constructed by stacking two of them. A far-ﬁeld image
with high transmittance is formed. The double-slab sys-
tem is an improved version of the near-ﬁeld lens from a
single metallic ﬁlm as far-ﬁeld focusing can also be ob-
tained.

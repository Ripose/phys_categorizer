The variance of nonlinear phase noise is analyzed by including the eﬀect of
intrachannel cross-phase modulation (IXPM)-induced nonlinear phase noise.
Consistent with Ho and Wang1 but in contrary to the conclusion of both
Kumar2 and Green et al.3, the variance of nonlinear phase noise does not
decrease much with the increase of chromatic dispersion. The results are con-
sistent with a careful reexamination of both Kumar2 and Green et al.3.

Keywords: nonlinear phase noise, intrachannel cross-phase modulation.

Recently, phase-modulated optical communication sys-
tems are found to have wide applications in long-haul
lightwave transmission systems4,5. Added directly to the
signal phase, nonlinear phase noise is the major degrada-
tion for phase-modulation signals1. However, the recent
paper by Kumar2 and early paper by Green et al.3 shown
that, in contrary to Ho and Wang1, nonlinear phase noise
becomes much smaller for highly dispersive transmission
system than that for a system with no dispersion. The
main purpose of this paper is to reconcile the discrep-
ancy among those three letters1,2,3. Although there is
no numerical error in both Kumar2 and Green et al.3,
the conclusion is unfortunately generalized further than
its numerical results for a single pulse2 or continuous-
wave signal3. The methods in both Refs. 2,3 are correct
and their results are consistent largely with the results of
Ref. 1 after a careful reinterpretation.

Ref. 2 found that the variance of the peak nonlin-
ear phase noise for a single pulse decreases rapidly
with chromatic dispersion. However, a phase-modulated
lightwave transmission is typically a chain of optical
pulses with diﬀerent modulated phases. Ref. 2 ignores
the nonlinear phase noise induced from adjacent op-
tical pulses, called intrachannel cross-phase modulation
(IXPM) phase noise1. When IXPM phase noise is in-
cluded, even with the model of Ref. 2, nonlinear phase
noise does not decrease much with chromatic dispersion.
As shown later in this letter, the IXPM phase noise may
aﬀect another pulse that is hundreds of picoseconds away
from the originated pulse.

The variance of nonlinear phase noise in Ref. 3 also
decreases signiﬁcantly for a continuous-wave signal with
chromatic dispersion. When the variance of nonlinear

phase noise was calculated, the numerical value of Eq. (9)
of Ref. 3 depending on the optical ﬁlter bandwidth [
∆ of
Eq. (9) there]. For the case of having an optical matched
0 for continuous-wave signal, the vari-
ﬁlter with ∆
ance of nonlinear phase noise of Ref. 3 is independent of
the amount of chromatic dispersion [i.e., Eq. (9) becomes
Eq. (8) there]. Another interpretation of Ref. 3 based on
optical matched ﬁlter may conclude that the variance of
nonlinear phase noise is independent of chromatic dis-
persion. Optical matched ﬁlter is used in this letter and
nonlinear phase noise does not decrease that much with
chromatic dispersion, largely consistent with the results
of Ref. 3 with same kind of ﬁlter.

Unfortunately, the method of Ref. 1 cannot directly ap-
ply to the system of both Refs. 2,3 without some modiﬁ-
cations. Similar to the analytical results of both Refs. 2,6,
there is an optical matched ﬁlter before the receiver.
Optical matched ﬁlter is either implicitly or explicitly
assumed1,2,6. For example, the ﬁnite variance of linear
phase noise [see Eq. (25) of Ref. 2] implicitly assumed a
matched ﬁlter7 but the numerical simulation of Ref. 2 as-
sumes an ideal band-pass ﬁlter with 70-GHz bandwidth.
When white Gaussian noise with inﬁnite bandwidth is
assumed, the noise power approaches inﬁnity. A ﬁnite
signal-to-noise ratio requires some types of optical ﬁlter
and an optical matched ﬁlter has the smallest bandwidth
and does not distort the signal. Optical matched ﬁlter is
used in some experimental measurements to improve the
receiver sensitivity8,9.

To make a direct comparison with Refs. 2,6, we con-
sider a transmission system consisting of two segments
of equal length within an ampliﬁed ﬁber span. The dis-
persion of the ﬁrst segment is anomalous whereas that
of the second segment is equal in magnitude but op-
posite in sign. Within each ﬁber span, the accumu-
lated dispersion as a function of distance is given by
z) where β2 is the group-velocity

dispersion coeﬃcient and L is the length of the ﬁber span.
In the ﬁrst order, the temporal distribution of nonlinear
phase noise is independent to the number of ﬁber spans
if all ﬁber spans has the same conﬁguration.

−
variance of (2) as a function of time is calculated in
Ref. 1. For system without chromatic dispersion, the
variance of (2) is equal to inﬁnity as n(z, t) is commonly
assumed as white Gaussian noise. The temporal proﬁle
ho(t) is calculated here, where ho(t)
of ζ(t) = ∆un(t)
is the impulse response of the optical ﬁlter preceding the
receiver. As the received signal is s(t) = u(L, t)
ho(t),
the nonlinear phase noise is approximately equal to

peak variance of nonlinear phase noise in Ref. 2. The
variance of φnl(t) was obtained in Ref. 1 for some dis-
crete points. Here in this letter, the whole temporal pro-
ﬁle of the variance of φnl(t) is derived and calculated. If
T0
the temporal proﬁle of φnl(t) is concentrated around
that is the 1/e-pulse width of u(0, t) = u(L, t), the peak
nonlinear phase noise from Ref. 2 is more than suﬃcient
to evaluate the system performance. However, if the tem-
poral proﬁle of φnl(t) is far wider than
T0, conclusion
derived from the peak nonlinear phase noise is not suﬃ-
cient to characterize the system performance. Although
the method here is similar to Refs. 1,5, the temporal pro-
ﬁle for the nonlinear phase noise is never shown and the
discrepancy between Refs. 1,2,3 is never reconciled.

From the model of both Refs. 1,2, with prefect span-
by-span dispersion compensation, the temporal proﬁle
for nonlinear phase noise is independent of the number
of ﬁber spans. The temporal proﬁle for a single-span
system is derived by the assumption by ﬁrst-order per-
turbation. With the ﬁrst-order perturbation, the tem-
poral distribution is also independent to the launched
power of the signal. For an optical matched ﬁlter with
ho(t) = u(0, t) = u(L, t), we obtain s(0) = √πA2
0T0 as
the energy of each optical pulse.

Using the property that both ∆un(t) and ζ(t) are cir-
cular symmetric complex Gaussian random variable, af-
ter some algebra and followed Refs. 1,5, the variance of
nonlinear phase noise as a function of time is

Figure 1 shows the temporal proﬁle of the standard
deviation (STD) of nonlinear phase noise of σnl(t) as a
function of time. The y-axis of Fig. 1 is in arbitrary linear
unit. Figure 1 is calculated for a 80-km ﬁber link with
dispersion coeﬃcient of D = 0, 3.5, 8, and 17 ps/km/nm
and an initial launched pulse of T0 = 5 ps. As explained
earlier, the temporal distribution by itself is independent
of the number of ﬁber spans. The number of ﬁber spans,
signal-to-noise ratio, and launched power scale the whole
curves of Fig. 1 up or down.

The x-axis of Fig. 1 does not have the same scale. The

x-axis of the curve in Fig. 1 having a larger dispersion
coeﬃcient is scaled down by a factor of 2 than the one
with smaller dispersion coeﬃcient. Similarly, the y-axis
of the curve in Fig. 1 having a larger dispersion coeﬃcient
is scaled up by the same factor of 2 than the one with
smaller dispersion coeﬃcient. After the scaling, all curves
in Fig. 1 have more or less the same height and width.

nonlinear phase noise also broadens rapidly with chro-
matic dispersion. With a range from
200 to +400 ps,
the temporal distribution of σnl(t) for D = 17 ps/km/nm
is about 20 times wider than the case without dispersion
of D = 0 of within

15 ps.

If the eﬀect of chromatic dispersion to ASE noise is ig-
nored (the model of Ref. 2), IXPM phase noise from ad-
jacent pulses to the same pulse is 100% correlated. If the
eﬀect of chromatic dispersion to ASE noise is included,
the correlation between IXPM phase noise from adjacent
pulses decreases slightly but the tail of the temporal pro-
ﬁle increases. For a qualitative understanding without
repeating the calculations in Refs. 1,5, we can assume
that the nonlinear phase noise induced by adjacent pulses
to the same pulse is highly correlated. For highly corre-
lated noise, the combined noise has a STD approximately
equal to the sum of the individual STD, approximately
the same as the area of the curves of Fig. 1. Because main
parts of the four curves in Fig. 1 have the same peaks and
width after scaling up in height and down in time by the
same factor, nonlinear phase noise does not decrease that
much with the increase of chromatic dispersion1,5.

Other than the dispersionless case with D = 0, the
temporal proﬁle of nonlinear phase noise is asymmetric
with respect to the original center of the pulse of t = 0.
In Ref. 3, a shift was observed in frequency domain but
the shift in time domain of Fig. 1 is ﬁrst observed in this
letter. The peak of nonlinear phase noise is located ap-
proximately at the center of the pulse but shifted slightly
to positive time. The asymmetric temporal proﬁle is due
to the inclusion of the dispersive eﬀects to the ASE noise.
Without the inclusion of the dispersive ASE, the tempo-
ral proﬁle of σnl(t) is symmetrical with respect to the
pulse center of t = 0.

The model here is very similar to the model of
Ref. 2. Only the ﬁrst-order term is used here but

3

S(z2)]ω2/2

Ref. 2 also included a minor second-order term [see
Eq. (16) there]. The model here includes the correla-

of ASE noise is ignored in Ref. 2. The temporal pro-
ﬁle here is asymmetric but the temporal proﬁle of Ref. 2
[given by hr(t) in Eq. (16) there] is symmetrical. The
temporal proﬁle h(t) in Ref. 2 [Eq. (16) there] is very sim-
ilar to (4) here. If IXPM phase noise is included to the
numerical method of Ref. 2, diﬀerent conclusion should
be arrived.

The optical matched ﬁlter for continuous-wave optical
signal is a very narrow-band optical ﬁlter. Using a very
narrow-band ﬁlter in the model of Ref. 3, the nonlinear
phase noise is independent of chromatic dispersion there.
If the optimal optical ﬁlter is used to detect a signal, both
Refs. 1,3 should arrive with similar results.

This letter ﬁnds that all three letters of Refs. 1,2,3
should provide consistent results if IXPM phase noise is
included in Ref. 2 and optical matched ﬁlter is used in
Ref. 3. Nonlinear phase noise does not decrease much
with the chromatic dispersion in a practical lightwave
transmission system. With optical matched ﬁlter and
according to both Refs. 3 and 1, the nonlinear phase noise
for system with large dispersion is approximately equal
to an equivalent dispersionless continuous-wave system
having the same power.

If the correlation of ASE noise due to chromatic dis-
persion is included to the model, the temporal proﬁle of
the STD of nonlinear phase noise is asymmetrical with
respect to its peak. The time-domain asymmetric proﬁle
is ﬁrst observed for nonlinear phase noise here.

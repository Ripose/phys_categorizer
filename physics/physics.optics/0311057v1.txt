A new interferometric technique is demonstrated for measuring Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman
Scattering (CARS) signals. Two forward-directed CARS signals are generated, one in each arm
of an interferometer. The deterministic nature of the CARS process allows for these two signals,
when spatially and temporally overlapped, to interfere with one another. Heterodyne detection can
therefore be employed to increase the sensitivity in CARS signal detection. In addition, nonlinear
CARS interferometry will facilitate the use of this spectroscopic technique for molecular contrast
in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an interfero-
metric optical imaging technique capable of imaging tis-
sue microstructure at near histological resolutions [1].
Unfortunately, the linear scattering properties of patho-
logical tissue probed by OCT are often morphologically
and/or optically similar to normal tissue. To address this
problem novel contrast methods for OCT have been re-
cently developed, such as spectroscopic OCT [2], a pump
and probe technique [3], and the use of engineered mi-
crospheres [4] or microbubbles [5].

Spectroscopic OCT (SOCT) measures the spectral ab-
sorption from tissues by measuring the spectral diﬀer-
ences between the source and the backscattered interfer-
ence signal to provide information about the properties
of the scatterers in the sample. However, this technique
is limited to the identiﬁcation of scatterers that have ab-
sorption within the bandwidth of the optical source. A
diﬀerent method to obtain contrast enhanced OCT em-
ploys engineered microsphere contrast agents, which can
be targeted to cell receptors thereby providing molecu-
lar speciﬁc contrast [4]. A drawback to this technique,
however, is that the contrast agents may negatively im-
pact the biology under investigation. We present a new
method for achieving enhanced OCT contrast, exploiting
the inherent vibrational frequency diﬀerences between
molecular bonds within the tissues. The spectroscopic
technique that is employed to detect these vibrational
diﬀerences is Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering
(CARS).

CARS is a well-known spectroscopic technique that
has recently received signiﬁcant attention for its appli-
cations to scanning microscopy. In CARS spectroscopy,
the frequencies of two incident lasers, ωp (pump) and ωs
(Stokes), are chosen such that the diﬀerence ωp −ωs = ωv

is equal to a Raman-active vibrational mode of the
molecule under study [6]. CARS is a non-linear, four-
wave mixing process. Furthermore, the CARS ﬁeld is a
result of the interaction between four photons and is gen-
erated in the phase-matching direction at the anti-Stokes
frequency ωAS = 2ωp − ωs, implying that the CARS sig-
nal intensity is linearly dependent on the Stokes ﬁeld in-
tensity and quadratically dependent on the pump ﬁeld
intensity. Note that, in addition to the CARS signal, a
broadband non-resonant background is always present,
limiting the vibrational contrast achieved in CARS mi-
croscopy. However, CARS is a coherent process, with
the phase of the anti-Stokes ﬁeld deterministically re-
lated to the phase of the excitation ﬁeld. Therefore, con-
structive interference of the anti-Stokes ﬁeld causes the
CARS signal to be signiﬁcantly larger than the sponta-
neous Raman signal, given the same average excitation
power [7]. All these characteristics have allowed CARS to
be successfully employed to provide vibrational contrast
in scanning microscopy [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

CARS scanning microscopy generally involves scan-
ning overlapped and tightly focused pump and Stokes
lasers through a sample while measuring the anti-Stokes
signal amplitude point by point. The ﬁrst CARS micro-
scope [8] utilized non-collinear pump and Stokes visible
lasers to demonstrate microscopic imaging of the spatial
distribution of deuterated molecular bonds in a sample of
onion skin. Tightly focused, collinear near-infrared pump
and Stokes pulses were used [9] to achieve improved back-
ground signal suppression, and three-dimensional sec-
tioning in living cells. In each of these CARS microscopy
techniques, the anti-Stokes photons are counted in order
to estimate the density of the Raman scatterers and/or
Raman susceptibility magnitude in the focal volume of

the microscope. However, the spectral phase informa-
tion is lost in this process and can only be inferred. In
this Letter we propose and demonstrate a new CARS
interferometric technique called Nonlinear Interferomet-
ric Vibrational Imaging (NIVI) with the capability for
heterodyne detection and the possibility to obtain a full
reconstruction of the magnitude and phase of the sample
Raman susceptibility.

The CARS interferometer described in this paper is
presented in Fig.1. An excitation ﬁeld consisting of two
overlapped pulses centered at the pump and Stokes wave-
lengths is divided by a beamsplitter into two separate
interferometer paths, which are referred to in Fig.1 as
arm ”S” (or sample arm) and arm ”R” (or reference
arm). A sample of a molecule is placed into each arm
into which the split excitation ﬁelds are focused. If the
frequency diﬀerence between the pump and Stokes pulses
is tuned to a Raman active vibrational mode present in
both sample S and sample R, an anti-Stokes signal is
generated in each arm of the interferometer. Because
the anti-Stokes pulse phase is deterministically related
to the phase of the pump and the Stokes pulses, the anti-
Stokes ﬁelds are coherent with the excitation ﬁelds and
also with each other. It follows (Feynman principle) that
when these anti-Stokes ﬁelds are temporally and spatially
overlapped, interference can be observed.

In our current setup the CARS is stimulated by a laser
system similar to that employed by [9]. A diode pumped
frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 laser is used to pump a
mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator operating at a center
wavelength of 807 nm, with a bandwidth of 30 nm, a rep-
etition rate of 82 MHz, and an average power of 300 mW.

These pulses seed a regenerative chirped pulse ampliﬁer
(Coherent, RegA 9000) producing approximately 70 fs,
5 J pulses at a repetition rate of 250 kHz with an aver-
age power of 1.25 W. Ten percent of this average power
is used as the pump beam while the remaining power
is directed to an optical parametric ampliﬁer (Coherent,
OPA 9400) which generates a 4 mW average power Stokes
beam, tunable from 400-1200 nm.

The pump and Stokes pulses, at 807 and 1072 nm re-
spectively, are used to excite the strong, isolated Raman-
active vibrational mode of benzene at 3063 cm−1. As
shown in Fig.1, these pulses are collinearly overlapped
using a dichroic mirror and split with a 50:50 ultrafast
beamsplitter into arms S and R. In each arm, a 30 mm
focal length, 12 mm diameter achromatic lens is used to
focus the pump and Stokes beams into a quartz cuvette
ﬁlled with benzene. The anti-Stokes signals generated in
each arm are collected in the collinear phase matching
direction using 30 mm focal length, 12 mm diameter sin-
glet lenses. The two anti-Stokes pulses are overlapped
in time by adjusting the relative delay and in space by
adjusting the position on a second beamsplitter. A high-
pass ﬁlter at 742 nm eliminates the remaining excitation
light. The ﬁltered anti-Stokes signal is spatially ﬁltered
through a 50 m diameter pin hole. The relative delay is
scanned by a computer-controlled single axis translation
stage at a constant rate in arm R, and the CARS signal
intensity is measured with a photomultiplier tube PMT
(Hamamatsu, HC 123). Lastly, the signal from the PMT
is ﬁltered with a low-pass anti-aliasing ﬁlter and sampled
with a PC based data acquisition system.

FIG. 3: CARS interferogram detected at the beamsplitter BS
and produced as the pathlength of arm R is scanned. The
modulus of the degree of the coherence function is used to ﬁt
to the envelope of the interferogram. The inset shows an en-
larged version of the interference pattern and its ﬁt by the real
part of the degree of coherence function. LC is the coherence
length of the CARS pulse.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the observed relationship
between the CARS and the Stokes intensity (pump inten-
sity ﬁxed) and the CARS and the pump intensity (Stokes
intensity ﬁxed), respectively. The solid lines represent
linear ﬁts of the experimental data. In agreement with
theory, the slope of the ﬁtted lines veriﬁes the linear re-
lationship between the anti-Stokes and the Stokes inten-
sities and the quadratic relationship between the anti-
Stokes and the pump intensities. Our signal is there-
fore a result of a four-wave mixing process. Moreover,
this process is CARS resonance because the anti-Stokes
power is maximized when the Stokes wavelength is tuned
to resonance with the Raman-active benzene vibrational
mode.

Fig.3 contains the measured interferogram resulting
from the interference between the two anti-Stokes signals
at the beamsplitter BS. The real part and the modulus of
the coherence function, for the case of a Gaussian spec-
tral distribution, are used to ﬁt the experimental data
(interferogram and envelope respectively). The resulting
coherence length LC, or the axial resolution of the inter-
ferometric CARS measurement technique, is found to be
equal to (32.3 +/- 0.3) µm (reduced χ2 = 0.001).

The inset of Fig.3 shows an enlarged version of the
interferogram fringes. Open circles correspond to the
experimentally measured data and the solid line repre-
sents a ﬁt of the data. This result indicates that two
anti-Stokes signals generated in separate samples can be
demodulated interferometrically, where the amplitude of
the fringe envelope gives information about the concen-

3

tration of the scatterers in the focal volume of the sam-
ple objective lens. The presence of interference clearly
demonstrates the potential of CARS as a promising tech-
nique for providing molecular contrast for OCT-like in-
terferometric imaging systems. In fact, the presence of
the interference indicates that similar Raman-active vi-
brational frequencies are present in both the reference
and the sample arm at the same path length from the de-
tector. The “ﬁngerprint” nature of Raman spectroscopy,
combined with the possibility to switch between diﬀerent
samples in arm R, could permit selective detection and
imaging, within the above mentioned axial resolution, of
diﬀerent molecular species present in the sample S.

Note ﬁnally that the interferometric detection scheme
could provide numerous advantages over traditional pho-
ton counting CARS microscopy.
Interfering a weak
CARS signal with another strong CARS signal, can
provide heterodyne sensitivity for improved S/N ratio.
Moreover, with full knowledge of the excitation pulses
and of the CARS interferogram, the spectral amplitude
and the phase of the CARS pulse can be measured. A
complete reconstruction of the Raman susceptibility may
then be attained allowing for a more accurate molecular
identiﬁcation [12].

In conclusion, we have described a new technique for
CARS measurement that relies on the deterministic na-
ture of the CARS process. The interference between two
CARS signals, generated in separate samples, was ob-
served allowing for heterodyne detection. This result is
extremely promising for the development of a new molec-
ular imaging technique (NIVI) based on non-linear, low-
coherence interferometry. While this demonstration used
forward CARS, epi-detected CARS [7] is coherent as well,
and is compatible with OCT coherence-ranging systems.
CARS interferometry provides CARS microscopy the ad-
vantages of interferometric detection and provides OCT
with molecular-speciﬁc contrast. These advantages could
make CARS interferometry a powerful tool for biologi-
cal imaging with OCT and for disease diagnosis at the
molecular level.

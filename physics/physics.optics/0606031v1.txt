When a circularly polarized plane wave is normally incident on a slab of a structurally chiral material with
local ¯42m point group symmetry and a central twist defect, the slab can function as either a narrowband re-
ﬂection hole ﬁlter for co–handed plane waves or an ultranarrowband transmission hole ﬁlter for cross–handed
plane waves, depending on its thickness and the magnitude of the applied dc electric ﬁeld. Exploitation of
the Pockels eﬀect signiﬁcantly reduces the thickness of the slab.

1 Introduction

Upon illumination by a normally incident, circularly polarized (CP) plane wave, a slab of a
structurally chiral material (SCM) with its axis of nonhomogeneity aligned parallel to the thickness
direction, is axially excited and reﬂects as well as transmits. Provided the SCM slab is periodically
nonhomogeneous and suﬃciently thick, and provided the wavelength of the incident plane wave lies
in a certain wavelength regime, the circular Bragg phenomenon is exhibited. This phenomenon may
be described as follows: reﬂection is very high if the handedness of the plane wave is the same as
the structural handedness of the SCM, but is very low if the two handednesses are opposite of each
other. This phenomenon has been widely used to make circular polarization ﬁlters of chiral liquid
crystals [1] and chiral sculptured thin ﬁlms [2].
If attenuation with the SCM slab is suﬃciently
low, it can thus function as a CP rejection ﬁlter. The circular Bragg phenomenon is robust enough
that periodic perturbations of the basic helicoidal nonhomogeneity can be altered to obtain diﬀerent
polarization–rejection characteristics [3]–[6].

In general, structural defects in periodic materials produce localized modes of wave resonance
either within the Bragg regime or at its edges. Narrowband CP ﬁlters have been fabricated by
In the absence
incorporating either a layer defect or a twist defect in the center of a SCM [2].
of the central defect, as stated earlier, co–handed CP light is substantially reﬂected in the Bragg
regime while cross–handed CP light is not. The central defect creates a narrow transmission peak
for co–handed CP light that pierces the Bragg regime, with the assumption that dissipation in the
SCM slab is negligibly small.

Numerical simulations show that, as the total thickness of a SCM slab with a central defect in-
creases, the bandwidth of the narrow transmission peak begins to diminish and an even narrower
peak begins to develop in the reﬂection spectrum of the cross–handed CP plane wave. There is a
crossover thickness of the device at which the two peaks are roughly equal in intensity. Further
increase in device thickness causes the co–handed transmission peak to diminish more and eventu-
ally vanish, while the cross–handed reﬂection peak gains its full intensity and then saturates [7],
[8]. The bandwidth of the cross–handed reﬂection peak is a small fraction of that of the co–handed
transmission peak displaced by it. Such a crossover phenomenon cannot be exhibited by the com-
monplace scalar Bragg gratings, and is unique to periodic SCMs [8]. An explanation for the crossover
phenomenon has recently been provided in terms of coupled wave theory [9].

Although the co–handed transmission peak (equivalently, reﬂection hole) has been observed and
even utilized for both sensing [10] and lasing [11], the cross–handed reﬂection peak (or transmission
hole) remains entirely a theoretical construct. The simple reason is that the total thickness for
crossover is very large [7]–[9]. Even a small amount of dissipation evidently vitiates the conditions
for the emergence of cross–handed reﬂection peak. Clearly, if the crossover thickness could be
signiﬁcantly reduced, the chances for the development of the cross–handed reﬂection peak would be
greatly enhanced.

Such a reduction could be possible if the SCM were to display the Pockels eﬀect [12] — this
thought emerged as a result of establishing the eﬀect of a dc electric ﬁeld on a defect–free SCM
endowed with a local ¯42m point group symmetry [13]. A detailed investigation, as reported in the
following sections, turned out to validate the initial idea.

The plan of this paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a description of the boundary value
problem when a CP plane wave is normally incident on a SCM slab with local ¯42m point group sym-
metry and a central twist defect. Section 3 contains sample numerical results to demonstrate that
the chosen device can function as either a narrowband reﬂection hole ﬁlter or an ultranarrowband
transmission hole ﬁlter — depending on (i) the thickness of the SCM slab, (ii) the handedness of the
incident plane wave, and (iii) the magnitude of the applied dc electric ﬁeld. Vectors are denoted in
boldface; the cartesian unit vectors are represented by ˆux, ˆuy, and ˆuz; symbols for column vectors
and matrixes are decorated by an overbar; and an exp(
iωt) time–dependence is implicit with ω as
the angular frequency. The wavenumber and the intrinsic impedance of free space are denoted by
k0 = ω√ǫ0µ0 and η0 =
µ0/ǫ0, respectively, with µ0 and ǫ0 being the permeability and permittivity
of free space.

The reﬂection amplitudes rL,R and the transmission amplitudes tL,R can be computed for speciﬁed

3 Numerical Results

Calculations of the reﬂectances and transmittances as functions of the parameter λ0/Ω were made
with and without electro–optic properties. The constitutive parameters used are that of ammonium
dihydrogen phosphate at λ0 = 546 nm [12], [14]: ǫ(0)
1 = 1.532, ǫ(0)
10−12 m V−1
10−12 m V−1. For illustrative results, the SCM was chosen to be structurally right–
and r63 = 8.5
handed (i.e., h = 1) and the tilt angle χ was ﬁxed at π/6. The parameter L/Ω was constrained to
be an even integer.

Figures 1 and 2 present the variations of the reﬂectances and transmittances with the normalized
wavelength λ0/Ω when the Pockels eﬀect is not invoked (i.e., Edc
z = 0), for L = 30Ω and L = 180Ω,
respectively. The twist defect Ψ = π/2. A co–handed reﬂection hole is clearly evident in the plot of
RRR at λ0/Ω
3.02, and the corresponding co–handed transmission peak may be seen in the plot
of TRR in Figure 1. This hole/peak–feature is of high quality. As the ratio L/Ω was increased, this

≃

4

feature began to diminish and was replaced by a cross–handed transmission hole in the plot of TLL
along with a corresponding cross–handed peak in the plot of RLL. At L = 180Ω (Figure 2), the
second feature is of similar quality to the feature in Figure 1. The bandwidth of the second feature
is a tiny fraction of the ﬁrst feature, however. Neither of the two features requires further discussion,
as their distinctive features are known well [7], [9], [15], [16], except to note that they constitute a
defect mode of propagation along the axis of chiral nonhomogeneity.

Figures 3 and 4 are the analogs of Figures 1 and 2, respectively, when the Pockels eﬀect has been
z = 1.5 GV m−1. Although L = 16Ω in Figure 3, the narrowband feature
invoked by setting Edc
therein is of the same high quality as in Figure 1. The ultranarrowband feature for L = 58Ω in
Figure 4 is wider than its counterpart in Figure 2, but could still be acceptable for many purposes.
The inevitable conclusion is that the incorporation of the Pockels eﬀect in suitable SCMs provides a
means to realize thinner narrowband and ultranarrowband ﬁlters that are also CP–discriminatory.
This is the main result of this communication.

parameters selected for Figures 1–4, this enhancement is signiﬁcant for low values of χ. The greater
the enhancement, the faster does the circular Bragg phenomenon develop as the normalized thick-

4 Concluding Remarks

The boundary value problem presented in this paper is of the reﬂection and transmission of a
circularly polarized plane wave that is normally incident on a slab of a structurally chiral material
with local ¯42m point group symmetry and a central twist defect. Numerical results show that the
slab can function as either a narrowband reﬂection hole ﬁlter for co–handed CP plane waves or an
ultranarrowband transmission hole ﬁlter for cross–handed CP plane waves, depending on its thickness
and the magnitude of the applied dc electric ﬁeld. Exploitation of the Pockels eﬀect signiﬁcantly
reduces the thickness of the slab for adequate performance. The presented results are expected to
urge experimentalists to fabricate, characterize, and optimize the proposed devices.

This paper is aﬀectionately dedicated to Prof. R. S. Sirohi on the occasion of his retirement as the Director
of the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.

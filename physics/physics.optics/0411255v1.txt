Abstract

We derive coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (CNLSE) for arbitrary polarized light
propagation in single-mode ﬁber. Considering a weak nonlinearity which is connected with
Kerr eﬀect, we give explicit expressions for nonlinear constants via integrals of Bessel functions.
The method of projecting we use allows a direct generalization to multi-mode ﬁber case.

Introduction. Basic equations

There are lot of publications devoted to the propagation and interaction of polarized electromagnetic
wave pulses in optical ﬁbers (see the review [1] ). Almost most of them exploit the results of [2], that
is going up to [3]. It is claimed that one can consider the ﬁber as made of isotropic material and the
origin of birefringence is originated from the third order nonlinearity (Kerr eﬀect [4]). The result
of the derivation is achieved by means of averaging across the ﬁber section and give the following
evolution along z axis.

where X +, X − are the components of electric ﬁelds (polarizations), k′′± is the dispersion constants
respectively, γ correspond to SPM (self phase modulation) and η correspond to XPM (cross phase
modulation). The computation of the γ/η relation (ratio) for Kerr medium which can be generally
elliptically birefringent, depends on birefringent ellipse axis choice [2, 5, 6, 7] and have value from
2/3 (linear case) to 2 (circular case). V ±
gN is a group velocity of polarization components. Here we
accept that the origin of a birefringence comes from nonlinear eﬀects, but it can be also descent
from random defects of ﬁber or special structure of waveguide (polarization maintaining ﬁbers).

The averaging procedure looks reasonable from a physical scope but in many cases leads to signif-
icant deviations from experiments [8]. The transition from a three-dimensional to one-dimensional
picture by the averaging is quite impossible in the case of multi-mode ﬁeld:
it leads to the only
equation while the modes should be described by independent variables.

In this paper we would base on a projecting procedure to the mode subspaces in a functional
space of a multi-mode ﬁeld [8]. In the nonlinear theory it leads to the important diﬀerence with the
mentioned approach already in the one-mode case that we shall study.

We describe polarization modes interaction in the cylindrical optical ﬁbers. We start from the

Maxwell electromagnetic ﬁeld equations

we use following system in the cylindrical polar coordinate and materials equations

When one study boundary conditions the polarization vector P is considered as a linear function of
E, we take the simplest form for the isotropic medium

and a wave equation for the electric ﬁeld in ﬁber is

Boundary conditions for our waveguide are

∇ · B = 0,
∇ · D = 0,

∇ × E = −

∇ × H =

D = ε0E + P.

P = χlinearE

∂t2 = 0.

Dr1 − Dr2 = 0,
Br1 − Br2 = 0,
n × (E2 − E1) = 0,
n × (H2 − H1) = 0.

Conditions (6c) for electric ﬁeld yield

ε1Er(r0+) = ε2Er(r0−),
Eϕ(r0+) = Eϕ(r0−),
Ez(r0+, ϕ, z) = Ez(r0−, ϕ, z)

(r0 - waveguide radius).

Wave number k must be same inside and outside waveguide to perform boundary conditions, we

deﬁned two parameters α and β

α2 = ω2ε0µ0ε1 − k2,
β2 = k2 − ω2ε0µ0ε2,

r ≤ r0,
r > r0,

where ω is the frequency of light wave.

Now if we use solution inside and outside waveguide for linear polarization and all of boundary
conditions we get equation for the eigenvalues kln (see equations 8). From this equation (which is
well known in linear theory of waveguides [4]) we can numerically evaluate eigenvalues. We put
values for l = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . and n = 1, 2, . . . where n is numbering following eigenvalues (following
solutions for ﬁxed l).

2 Nonlinearity account - Kerr eﬀect

In general the polarization should be written as

P = ε0 (cid:18)

χ(1)E + χ(2)...EE + χ(3)...EEE + · · ·

,

(cid:19)

(9)

where χ(1) is linear dielectric susceptibility and corresponds to the refraction of light. In a case of
the second order dielectric susceptibility χ(2), we could omit it because it is equal zero in materials
construct with symmetrical molecule. From higher order dielectric susceptibility we save only third
order because rest of orders are negligible. The third order susceptibility are responsible for nonlinear
refraction of light, self phase modulation (SPM) and cross phase modulation (XPM).

Now we can write nonlinear polarization for our waveguide in the form

PNL(t) = ε0

χ(3)(t − t1, t − t2, t − t3)

...E(t1)E(t2)E(t3)dt1dt2dt3.

If we take into consideration that we have impulses longer then 0.1ps we can treat response of

medium as instantaneous and write

PNL(t) = ε0χ(3)(t, t, t)

...E(t)E(t)E(t).

The third order dielectric susceptibility χ(3) for the isotropic media is discussed in the papers [4] [9].
Basing on it we write

χijkl = χxxxxδij δkl + χxyxyδikδjl + χxyyxδilδkj,

χxxxx = χyyyy = χzzzz = χxxyy + χxyxy + χxyyx,

all of components are in form

χxxyy ≃ χxyxy ≃ χxyyx,

This mean that we load light into waveguide with two orthogonal polarization.
We take into computation electric ﬁeld in form

For more generality considering about birefringent axis see [5].

Let us construct the only transversal mode with ﬁxed α and β which mean that we chose the
simplest form by ﬁxing l = 0 and n = 1 (we cut series to one term, this allow us to simplify
calculation of the Pz). We introduce a slowly varying amplitude of the wave envelope [11] in form

We insert equations (29) into (31) and then we put the slowly varying amplitude (25) in it and
if the relation between parameters is ǫ2 ∼ σ and if we use a new coordinate system which moves at
group velocity (32), than to the second order in ǫ we can obtain nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in

In this paper we shows a new approach to derive a formula for CNLS equations.

The main idea is to take into account multi-mode case. Here we show the simplest case for n = 1
but if we use equation (25) and take electromagnetic ﬁeld (29) with more modes (this mean n > 1)
we could compute multi-mode case. The proceeding is the same as n = 1 but it is more intricate
and derive simple formula is more diﬃcult.

In this paper we don’t show formula for V ±
Additionally we can allow for change birefringent axis (see eq. (30)) and take case with diﬀerent

gN but it can be calculate.

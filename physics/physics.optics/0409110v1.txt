In this paper, we report high-precision absolute distance and vibration
measurements performed simultaneously with frequency scanned interfer-
ometry using a pair of single mode optical ﬁbers. Absolute distance was
determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning
the laser frequency. A high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot interferometer(F-P) was
used to determine frequency changes during scanning. Two multi-distance-
measurement analysis techniques were developed to improve distance precision
and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations. Under laboratory
conditions, a precision of 40 nm was demonstrated for an absolute distance
of approximately 0.45 meters using the ﬁrst analysis technique. The second
analysis technique has capability to measure vibration frequencies ranging
from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz with minimal amplitude on few nanometers order
without a priori knowledge.

Introduction

The motivation for this project is to design a novel optical system for quasi-real time
alignment of tracker detector elements used in High Energy Physics (HEP) exper-
iments. A.F. Fox-Murphy et.al. from Oxford University reported their design of a
frequency scanned interferometer (FSI) for precise alignment of the ATLAS Inner
Detector.1 Given the demonstrated need for improvements in detector performance,
we plan to design an enhanced FSI system to be utilized for the alignment of tracker
elements used in the next generation of electron positron Linear Collider (NLC) de-
tectors. Current plans for future detectors require a spatial resolution for signals from
a tracker detector, such as a silicon microstrip or silicon drift detector, to be ap-
proximately 7-10 µm.2 To achieve this required spatial resolution, the measurement
precision of absolute distance changes of tracker elements in one dimension should be
on the order of 1 µm. Simultaneous measurements from hundreds of interferometers
will be used to determine the 3-dimensional positions of the tracker elements.

We describe here a demonstration FSI system built in the laboratory for ini-
tial feasibility studies. The main goal was to determine the potential accuracy of
absolute distance measurements (ADM’s) that could be achieved under laboratory
conditions. Secondary goals included estimating the eﬀects of vibrations and study-
ing error sources crucial to the absolute distance accuracy. A signiﬁcant amount of

1

research on ADM’s using wavelength scanning interferometers already exists.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
In one of the most comprehensive publications on this subject, Stone et al. describe in
detail a wavelength scanning heterodyne interferometer consisting of a system built
around both a reference and a measurement interferometer,3 the measurement preci-
sions of absolute distance ranging from 0.3 to 5 meters are
250 nm by averaging
distance measurements from 80 independent scans.

∼

Detectors for HEP experiment must usually be operated remotely because of
safety reasons such as intensive radiation, high voltage or strong magnetic ﬁelds.
In addition, precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other detector
components, making access diﬃcult. For practical application of FSI, optical ﬁbers
for light delivery and return are therefore necessary.

we constructed a FSI demonstration system by employing a pair of single mode
optical ﬁbers of approximately 1 meter length each, one for transporting the laser
beam to the beam splitter and retroreﬂector and another for receiving return beams.
A key issue for the optical ﬁber FSI is that the intensity of the return beams received
10−10 for a
by the optical ﬁber is very weak; the geometrical eﬃciency is 6.25
measurement distance of 0.5 meter. A novelty in our design is the use of a gradient
index lens (GRIN lens) to collimate the output beam from the optical ﬁber.

×

We believe our work represents a signiﬁcant enhancement in the ﬁeld of FSI in
that high-precision ADM’s and vibration measurement are performed simultaneously
without a priori knowledge using a tunable laser, an isolator, an oﬀ-the-shelf F-P, a
ﬁber coupler, two single mode optical ﬁbers, an interferometer, novel fringe analysis
and vibration extraction techniques. Two new multi-distance-measurement analysis
techniques are presented, to improve precision and to extract the amplitude and
frequency of vibrations. Major uncertainties are also estimated in this paper.

2. Principles

The intensity I of any two-beam interferometer can be expressed as

I = I1 + I2 + 2√I1I2 cos(φ1

φ2)

−

where I1 and I2 are the intensities of the two combined beams, φ1 and φ2 are the
phases. Assuming the optical path lengths of the two beams are L1 and L2, the phase
diﬀerence in Eq. (1) is Φ = φ1
(ν/c), where ν is the optical frequency
L2
of the laser beam, and c is the speed of light.

φ2 = 2π

For a ﬁxed path interferometer, as the frequency of the laser is continuously
scanned, the optical beams will constructively and destructively interfere, causing
“fringes”. The number of fringes ∆N is

∆N =

(∆ν/c) = L∆ν/c

where L is the optical path diﬀerence between the two beams, and ∆ν is the scanned
frequency range. The optical path diﬀerence(OPD for absolute distance between
beamsplitter and retroreﬂector) can be determined by counting interference fringes
while scanning the laser frequency.

3. Demonstration System of FSI

A schematic of the FSI system with a pair of optical ﬁbers is shown in Fig. 1. The
light source is a New Focus Velocity 6308 tunable laser (665.1 nm < λ < 675.2 nm).
A high-ﬁnesse (> 200) Thorlabs SA200 F-P is used to measure the frequency range
scanned by the laser, the free spectral range (FSR) of two adjacent F-P peaks is
1.5 GHz, which corresponds to 0.002 nm. A Farady Isolator was employed to reject
light reﬂected back into the lasing cavity. The laser beam was coupled into a single
mode optical ﬁber by using a ﬁber coupler. Data acquisition is accomplished using a
National Instruments DAQ card capable of simultaneously sampling 4 channels at a
rate of 5 MS/s/ch with a precision of 12-bits. Omega thermistors with a tolerance of
0.02 K and a precision of 0.01 mK are used to monitor temperature. The apparatus
is supported by a damped Newport optical table.

In order to reduce air ﬂow and temperature ﬂuctuations, a transparent plastic
box was constructed on top of the optical table. PVC pipes were installed to shield
the volume of air surrounding the laser beam. Inside the PVC pipes, the typical
standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about 0.5 mK. Temperature
ﬂuctuations were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic
box and PVC pipes.

The beam intensity coupled into the return optical ﬁber is very weak, requiring
ultra-sensitive photodetectors for detection. Considering the limited laser beam in-
tensity and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of interferometers, it’s
vital to increase the geometrical eﬃciency. To this end, a collimator is built by placing
an optical ﬁber in a ferrule (1mm diameter) and gluing one end of the optical ﬁber
to a GRIN lens. The GRIN lens is a 0.25 pitch lens with 0.46 numerical aperture,
1 mm diameter and 2.58 mm length which is optimized for a wavelength of 630nm.
The density of the outgoing beam from the optical ﬁber is increased by a factor of
approximately 1000 by using GRIN lens. The return beams are received by another
1010V /A.

4. Analysis and Results

For a FSI system, drifts and vibrations occurring along the optical path during the
scan will be magniﬁed by a factor of Ω = ν/∆ν, where ν is the average optical
frequency of the laser beam and ∆ν is the scanned frequency. For the full scan of our
laser, Ω
67. Small vibrations and drift errors that have negligible eﬀects for many
optical applications may have signiﬁcant impacts on a FSI system. A single-frequency
vibration may be expressed as xvib(t) = avib cos(2πfvibt + φvib), where avib, fvib and
φvib are the amplitude, frequency and phase of the vibration respectively. If t0 is the
start time of the scan, Eq. (2) can be re-written as

where Ltrue is the true optical path diﬀerence without vibration eﬀects. If the path
averaged refractive index of ambient air ¯ng is known, the measured distance is Rmeas =
Lmeas/(2¯ng).

−

If the measurement window size (t

t0) is ﬁxed and the window to measure a set of
Rmeas is sequentially shifted, the eﬀects of the vibration will be evident. We use a set
of distance measurements in one scan by successively shifting the measurement win-
dow one F-P peak forward each time. The arithmetic average of all measured Rmeas
values in one scan is taken to be the measured distance of the scan. For a large num-
ber of distance measurements Nmeas, the vibration eﬀects can be greatly suppressed.
Similarly, the uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination dominant in our
current system can also be reduced with multiple uncorrelated measurements. Av-
eraging multiple measurements in one scan provides similar precision improvement
as averaging distance measurements from multiple independent scans, but is faster,
more eﬃcient and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift. In this way, we
can improve the distance accuracy dramatically if there are no signiﬁcant drift er-
rors caused by temperature variation. This multi-distance-measurement technique is
called ’slip measurement window with ﬁxed size’. However, there is a trade oﬀ in that
the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of Nmeas because of the larger
magniﬁcation factor Ω for smaller measurement window size.

The typical measurement residual versus the distance measurement number in
one scan using above technique is shown in Fig.2(a), where the scanning rate was 0.5
nm/s and the sampling rate was 125 kS/s. Measured distances minus their average
value for 10 sequential scans are plotted versus number of measurements (Nmeas) per
scan in Fig.2(b). It can be seen that the distance errors decrease with an increase of
Nmeas. The standard deviation (RMS) of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is
1.1 µm if there is only one distance measurement per scan, Nmeas = 1. If Nmeas = 1200
and the average value of 1200 distance measurements in each scan is considered as the
ﬁnal measured distance of the scan, the RMS of the ﬁnal measured distances for 10
scans is 41 nm for the distance of 449828.965 µm, the relative distance measurement
precision is 91 ppb.

In order to extract the amplitude and frequency of the vibration, another multi-
distance-measurement technique called ’slip measurement window with ﬁxed start
point’ was presented. In Eq. (3), if t0 is ﬁxed, the measurement window size is en-
larged one F-P peak for each shift, an oscillation of a set of measured Rmeas values
reﬂects the amplitude and frequency of vibration. This technique is not suitable
for distance measurement because there always exists an initial bias term includ-
ing t0 which cannot be determined accurately in our current system. In order to
test this technique, a PZT transducer was employed to produce vibrations of the
retroreﬂector. For instance, the frequencies of controlled vibration source were set
0.02 µm, respectively.

Based on our current analysis, vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 100 Hz
and amplitudes ranging from
5 nm to 1 micron order can be extracted precisely.
Vibration frequency far below 0.1 Hz can be regarded as drift error which can not
be suppressed by the above analysis techniques. A dual-laser FSI system6, 10 intended
to cancel the drift errors is under study in the lab currently(to be described in a
subsequent article).

Nanometer vibration measurement by a self-aligned optical feedback vibrometry
technique has been reported.9 The vibrometry technique is able to measure vibration
frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz with minimal measurable vibration ampli-
tude of 1 nm. Our second multi-distance-measurement technique demonstrated above
has capability to measure vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz with
minimal amplitude on few nanometers order without a priori knowledge.

5. Error Estimations

Some major error sources are estimated in the following;

1) Error from uncertainties of fringe and scanned frequency determination. The
measurement precision of R (the error due to the air refractive index uncertainty is
considered separately below) is given by (σR/R)2 = (σ∆N /∆N )2 + (σ∆ν/∆ν)2. For
a typical scanning rate of 0.5 nm/s with 10 nm scan range, the full scan time is 20
seconds. The total number of samples for one scan is 2.5 MS if the sampling rate is 125
kS/s. There is about a 4
5 sample ambiguity in fringe peak and valley position due to
a vanishing slope and the limitation of the 12-bit sampling precision. However, there
is a much smaller uncertainty for the F-P peaks because of their sharpness. Thus,
1.9 ppm. If Nmeas = 1200, the corresponding
the estimated uncertainty is σR/R
Ω∗

∼

2) Error from vibrations. The detected amplitude and frequency for vibration
(without controlled vibration source) are about 0.3 µm and 3.2 Hz. The corresponding
time for Nmeas = 1200 sequential measurements is 5.3 seconds. A rough estimation
of the resulting error gives σR/R

3) Error from thermal drift. The refractive index of air depends on air tempera-
ture, humidity and pressure etc(ﬂuctuation of humidity and pressure have negligible
eﬀect on distance measurement for the 20-second scan). Temperature ﬂuctuations are
well controlled down to about 0.5 mK(RMS) in our laboratory by the plastic box on
the optical table and the pipe shielding the volume of air near the laser beam. For a
room temperature of 21 0C, an air temperature change of 1 K will result in a 0.9 ppm
change of air refractive index. For a temperature variation of 0.5 mK in the pipe,
42 ppb.
Nmeas = 1200, the estimated error will be σR/R
89 ppb,
with the major error sources arising from the uncertainty of fringe determination and
the thermal drift. The estimated relative error agrees well with measured relative
spreads of 91 ppb in real data.

Ω∗
The total error from the above sources, when added in quadrature, is

Besides the above error sources, other sources can contribute to systematic bias
in the absolute diﬀerential distance measurement. The major systematic bias comes
from uncertainty of the FSR of the F-P used to determine scanned frequency range
precisely, the relative error would be σR/R
50 ppb if the FSR was calibrated by
an wavemeter with a precision of 50 ppb. A wavemeter of this precision was not
available for the measurements described here. Systematic bias from uncertainties
of temperature, air humidity and barometric pressure scales should have negligible
eﬀect.

6. Conclusion

An optical ﬁber FSI system was constructed to make high-precision absolute distance
and vibration measurements simultaneously. A novel design of the optical ﬁber with
GRIN lens was presented which improves the geometrical eﬃciency signiﬁcantly. Two
new multi-distance-measurement analysis techniques were presented to improve dis-
tance precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations. An accuracy
of 40 nm for a distance of approximately 0.45 meters under laboratory conditions was
achieved using the ﬁrst analysis technique. The second analysis technique is able to
measure vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz with minimal amplitude
on few nanometers order. Major error sources were estimated, and the observed errors
were found to be in good agreement with expectation.

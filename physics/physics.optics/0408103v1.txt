A right-handed isotropic medium with a negative refractive index

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The sign of the refractive index of any medium is soley determined by the requirement that the
propagation of an electromagnetic wave obeys Einstein causality. Our analysis shows that this
requirement predicts that the real part of the refractive index may be negative in an isotropic
medium even if the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are both positive. Such a
system may be a route to negative index media at optical frequencies. We also demonstrate that
the refractive index may be positive in left-handed media that contain two molecular species where
one is in its excited state.

PACS numbers: 41.20.Jb,78.20.Ci,42.25.Fx

In 1968 Veselago [1] considered the electrodynamic
properties of isotropic media where the real part of the
electric permittivity ǫ and the real part of the magnetic
permeability µ are simultaneously negative. Veselago
showed that if ǫ, µ < 0 then the electric ﬁeld E, the
magnetizing ﬁeld H and the wave-vector k form a left-
handed orthogonal set, contrary to all known naturally-
occurring materials where the triplet of these vectors is
right-handed. Media with both negative electric per-
mittivity and magnetic permeability are referred to as
left-handed materials (LHM) at the frequencies for which
ǫ, µ < 0.

A consequence of simultaneously negative ǫ and µ is
H and the wave-vector
that the Poynting vector S = E
k = (ω/
B point in opposite directions for a
monochromatic plane wave with angular frequency ω, as
here the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld necessarily op-
poses that of the magnetizing ﬁeld, B = µH [1]. Vese-
lago argued that the direction of the energy ﬂow (S) must
point away from its source and thereby reached the sur-
prising conclusion that in LHM the wave-vector points
toward the source [1]. This in turn lead to the prediction
that LHM exhibit a negative refractive index, as well as
reversed Doppler and Cherenkov eﬀects [1].

No naturally-occurring isotropic material is known to
have ǫ, µ < 0 at the same frequency, since the underly-
ing polarizabilities and magnetizabilities, in general, ex-
hibit diﬀerent frequency responses (resonances). Pendry
et al. thus [2] suggested that structures containing metal
strips and split-ring resonators could be engineered such
that both ǫ and µ are negative at microwave frequencies.
Shelby et al.
[3] subsequently reported the observation
of negative refraction at 10.5 GHz in a left-handed meta-
material. There are to date no experimental reports of
homogeneous, isotropic media that exhibit a negative re-
fractive index at optical frequencies. We note that nei-
ther photonic crystals [4, 5], nor birefringent crystal as-
semblies [6] are isotropic and can therefore not be char-
acterized by a single, scalar refractive index.

In this Letter we consider several cases in which neg-
ative refraction may be achieved in isotropic and homo-
geneous media. Some aspects of the connection between
Einstein causality and the sign of the refractive index
have been discussed previously [7, 8]. Here we show that
a standard analysis of causal wave-propagation, as ﬁrst
discussed by Sommerfeld and Brillouin [9], reveals that
the real part of the refractive index, Re[
n(ω)], may in
principle be of either sign for a LHM. Remarkably, a
n(ω)] < 0, may be observed
negative refractive index, Re[
e
even when both ǫ, µ > 0 (i.e. a right-handed medium
(RHM)). This may be particularly promising for the ob-
servation of negative refraction and associated phenom-
ena [1, 10] at optical frequencies in isotropic media.

deﬁned and when a certain branch-cut has been chosen
k(ω) become analytic (see for instance [11]) such
does
that the sign of the refractive index can be determined.
The causal propagation of an electromagnetic wave re-
quires that the Green functions g(z, t) = 0 for t < (z/c)
(see also [12]). Further, the following conditions hold
i) due to a material’s ﬁnite bandwidth
ǫ0 and
µ(ω)
k(ω) is analytic in the

upper-half of the complex ω-plane. The latter implies
ǫ(ω) and
that not only the poles but also the zeros of
e
µ(ω) must lie outside the upper-half of the complex ω-
plane, such that the material response is causal. This
can be shown using Titchmarsh’s theorem [11, 13]. The
e
branch-cuts of
k(ω) can then be chosen to lie outside the
upper-half of the complex ω-plane, and (the principal)

It is then possible to evaluate the integral in Eq. (4)
by closing the contour in the upper-half of the complex
ω-plane, and it follows that g(z, t) = 0 for t < (z/c), as
is required by causality [9, 14, 15, 16].

We now express the permittivity and the permeability
in terms of Lorentz oscillator models as their general-
ity facilitates the discussion of the refractive index for
a variety of systems, such as atoms in the gas phase,
conductors near a plasmon resonance, or any medium
whose optical properties are directly related to the un-
derlying molecular polarizabilities and magnetizabilities.

LHM with a positive refractive index: For the sub-
sequent discussion we consider the cases for which the
sign of F and G in equations (5) and (6) can indepen-
dently vary. We suppose that this may, at least in prin-
ciple, be achieved in a multi-component system or in cer-
tain multi-level systems. Considering a two-component
system, we assume that in a certain frequency range
the electric permittivity is dominated by one molecular
species whereas the magnetic permeability is dominated
by the other species. If only one of the species is inverted,
then we may have F and G of opposite sign. Similarly, in
an inverted one-component multi-level system there may
be nearby lying states that have electric-dipole allowed,
but magnetic-dipole forbidden transitions, such that the
polarizability and magnetizability, which respectively un-
µ(ω), are of opposite sign. If for these sys-
derlie
tems we describe
µ(ω) by an eﬀective Lorentz
oscillator model, then there are the following possible
combinations: F, G > 0 (Fig. 2(a)), F and G of opposite
e
sign (Fig. 2(b)), only one case is shown), and F, G < 0
(Fig. 2(c)).

LHM does not necessarily need to have a negative refrac-
tive index. Table I lists the four possible combinations.
To our knowledge only the passive LHM (Type I) has
been discussed previously.
RHM with a negative refractive index: Now, we
show that even when both ǫ and µ are positive, i.e. a
right-handed medium (RHM), the structures of the ze-
ros and poles may in certain cases give rise to a negative
refractive index. Remarkably, this can happen for a non-
magnetic system and is therefore a potential route to
negative index media at optical frequencies. We consider
a two-component system with µ = µ0 and with

< π, such that
(3π/4) <
(3π/2) < φǫ < 2π. Hence, the real part of
ǫ is positive.
Given that µ = µ0 is real and positive, the system is a
RHM. However, the refractive index will have a negative
real part, since (3π/4) < φn = (φǫ/2) < π. Similarly,
for the lower sign in Eqn. (8) and Eqn. (9) (not shown
in the ﬁgure), we can have
(3π/2). Hence,
ǫ is again positive and the system is also

real part, since
(3π/4). It is in-

teresting to note that for this system the imaginary part
of the refractive index is now negative. This indicates
that while the system with the upper sign in Eqn. (8)
and Eqn. (9) is lossy, the system with the lower sign has
gain.

Numerical estimates show that for certain frequency
ranges RHM with negative refractive index may be re-
alized experimentally. We considered gas-phase as well
as condensed-phase media, and here we provide two spe-
ciﬁc examples using values typical of condensed molecu-
lar media. In these examples the number densities are
somewhat high, however, the results show that it is plau-
sible that such systems may be realized.

α and β are given by

α =

and

β =

2N2p2

,

(10)

where p1 and p2 are the transition dipole moments, and
N1 and N2 the number densities of molecular species 1
and 2, respectively. We now assume that species 1 is in its
1028 m−3 with a resonance
ground state and has N1 = 3
×
at ωpole1 = 14, 000 cm−1. Further, we take p1 = p2 = 3
Debye, and Γ = 400 cm−1. If species 2 is in the excited
state at ωpole2 = 20, 000 cm−1 with N2 = 2.52
1027
m−3, then the real part of the refractive index becomes
negative between 445 and 530 nm. For the wavelengths
between 455 and 495 nm the material is moreover right-
handed, i.e., the real part of the refractive index domi-
nates, and reaches
1.2 in this wavelength range. The
parameters used above are based on the upper sign in
Eqn. (8) and Eqn. (9), and the system is lossy for the
frequency range where the real part of the refractive in-
dex becomes negative, as can be seen in Fig. 4(a).

Similarly, we can envision a system with gain by con-
sidering the lower sign case in Eqn. (8) and Eqn. (9). As-
1027 m−3 for the non-inverted species,
suming, N1 = 2
1028 for the inverted species, ωpole1 = 14, 000
N2 = 1.75
cm−1, ωpole2 = 20, 000 cm−1, Γ = 400 cm−1, and tak-
ing p1 = p2 = 3 Debye, we ﬁnd that the real part of
the refractive index becomes negative (for the wavelength
range 650 to 920 nm), and within the range of 720 to 915
nm, the material is right-handed and its refractive index
reaches
1.1 (see Fig. 4(b)). However, now the imagi-
nary part of the index is also negative, i.e. the system

−

has gain which may facilitate observation of the eﬀect. It
is also clear that a negative refractive index can appear
when the material is not right-handed, i.e. when the real
part of the permittivity is negative.

We have considered the connection between Einstein
causality and the refractive index based on Sommer-
feld and Brillouin theory of causal wave propagation
[9, 14, 15, 16]. The refractive index is uniquely deter-
mined for any given ǫ and µ. Considering both inverted
systems and two-component systems, we have shown that
a LHM does not need to have a negative refractive index.
We predict the existence of non-magnetic RHM systems

The latter suggests a new class of negative refractive in-

We use a phenomenological Hamiltonian approach to derive a set of coupled mode equations that
describe light propagation in waveguides that are periodically side-coupled to microcavities. The
structure exhibits both Bragg gap and (polariton like) resonator gap in the dispersion relation. The
origin and physical signiﬁcance of the two types of gaps are discussed. The coupled-mode equations
derived from the eﬀective ﬁeld formalism are valid deep within the Bragg gaps and resonator gaps.

INTRODUCTION

In the past several years the linear and nonlinear prop-
erties of side-coupled waveguiding structures have at-
tracted the attention of many researchers1−12. These
structures consist of one or more waveguiding elements
in which forward and backward propagating waves are
indirectly coupled to each other via one or more mediat-
ing resonant cavities. Perhaps the most common propos-
als for realizing these structures involve photonic crys-
tal (PC) waveguides with defect modes slightly displaced
from the waveguiding region (Fig. 1a, left)2,6, or micro-
ring resonator structures in which two channel waveg-
uides are side-coupled to micro-ring resonators (Fig. 1a,
right)7. In the PC structure the forward and backward
propagating modes within the waveguide are coupled via
the defect; for the micro-ring structure, the forward going
mode in the lower (upper) channel waveguide is coupled,
via the micro-ring, to the backward going mode in the
upper (lower) channel. The linear and nonlinear proper-
ties of both types of structures have been studied2,6−9.
The electromagnetic properties of these structures can
be accurately determined in great detail using numer-
ically intensive methods such as ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-
domain (FDTD) simulations14. An analysis in terms
of Wannier functions can substantially reduce compu-
tation time for the PC structure15, but the numerical
problem remains daunting. In particular, full FDTD cal-
culations of the micro-ring structures have to date been
conﬁned to two-dimensional analogs of the actual struc-
tures of interest14. Furthermore, direct numerical sim-
ulation, while valuable for design purposes, oﬀers little
insight into the physics of the structures. Consequently,
semi-analytical techniques, such as the scattering-matrix
approach of S. Fan et al.2 and Yong Xu et al.6, have been
proposed. Using these techniques the optical properties
of side-coupled structures can be understood in terms of
the interactions between a small number of modes.

is to derive coupled mode equations (CME) that describe
pulse propagation in such structures. Coupled mode the-
ory has long been used as an eﬀective design tool for grat-
ing structures where forward and backward propagating
waves are directly coupled via an index grating16. In di-
rectly coupled structures, it is well known that a Bragg
gap opens in the dispersion relation of the structure when
the phase accumulated in one round trip through a pe-
riod of the grating is an integer multiple of 2π, so that
the slight reﬂections that are incurred due to the grat-
ing are coherently enhanced. Structures possessing a
Bragg gap have found a variety of uses, such as dispersion
compensation17 and wavelength division multiplexing18.
In the side-coupled structure the Bragg feedback mech-
anism, and hence the Bragg gap, does exist, although it
is now mediated by the coupling cavity. However, there
is also a second type of gap: a resonator gap, which is
associated with the resonance frequencies - and therefore
the geometry - of the mediating cavity. For the micro-
ring resonator structure the interpretation of this gap is
straightforward: when the phase accumulated in a round-
trip through the micro-ring resonator is an integer mul-
tiple of 2π, then the coupling between the forward and
backward going waves is resonantly enhanced. Of these
two gaps, the resonator gap is perhaps the more impor-
tant, because it exhibits a deep transmission dip seen
even in a structure with only one unit cell.

Because side-coupled structures exhibit both Bragg
and resonator gaps, it is to be expected that a CME de-
scription of optical pulse propagation will be more com-
plicated than in Bragg gratings. The CME for Bragg
gratings involve two ﬁelds (forward and backward going)
interacting via a coupling coeﬃcient. For side-coupled
structures, the most interesting situation is when a res-
onator gap lies near one of the Bragg gaps, and we show
in this paper that the relevant CME then involves three
ﬁelds: a cavity ﬁeld and forward and backward going
ﬁelds.

In this paper we concentrate our attention on periodic,
side coupled structures (Fig. 1b). Our primary objective

We derive our CME using a phenomenological Hamil-
tonian approach, which distills the essential physical in-

teractions of the structure, and hence provides a simple
physical picture of optical interactions. We build the
ﬁelds in our CME as Fourier superpositions of the modes
in the Hamiltonian. Hence, our CME are derived for in-
ﬁnite, periodic structures in which the coupling to each
cavity is the same. Nevertheless, we show that our CME
can be generalized to describe ﬁnite, apodized structures,
in which the coupling (but not the period) varies from
cavity to cavity. Therefore, the CME can be used to
describe ﬁnite structures with only a small number of
cavities. Indeed, the general Hamiltonian approach we
advocate can be applied even to structures with only one
or two cavities, if the formalism we introduce in Sec. II
is extended to a discrete number of (not necessarily iden-
tical) cavities. In both discrete and periodic scenarios,
the Hamiltonian approach exhibits the similarities of the
optical dynamics of these artiﬁcially structured materials
to more traditional problems in solid state physics. As
well, it allows for an easy quantization of the description
to address the quantum optics of these structures. We
plan to turn to this, as well as the direct derivation of
our phenomenological Hamiltonian from the underlying
electrodynamics, in future publications.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we
describe the Hamiltonian model for a system with a single
microresonator,
investigate the transmission/reﬂection
spectrum of the structure, and indicate how the param-
eters in our phenomenological Hamiltonian can be set
from more common models of cavity resonators. In Sec.
III we discuss how the Hamiltonian can be used to model
a periodic waveguide-resonator structure. We then dis-
cuss methods of reducing the number of ﬁelds and in-
teractions in our Hamiltonian while retaining the basic
physics. In Sec. IV we derive the coupled mode equations
in terms of eﬀective ﬁelds built as Fourier superpositions
of the modes in the Hamiltonian of Sec. III, and we show
how to modify these CME to describe ﬁnite, apodized
structures. In Sec. V we conclude.

II. HAMILTONIAN MODEL AND
TRANSMISSION FOR A SINGLE CAVITY
STRUCTURE

In this section we construct a Hamiltonian model for
a structure in which forward and backward propagating
waves are indirectly coupled to each other via a cavity
centred at z = z0. We will focus on classical optics here,
but because its easy generalization to quantum optics is
one of the strengths of this approach, we adopt a quan-
tum notation and, for the classical Poisson bracket
,
.., ..
}
we write (i¯h)−1 [.., ..]; we also use † to indicate complex
conjugation. We will also often speak of operators rather
than variables, especially when it makes the physics more
clear. For example, we introduce a†
k as creation
operators for photons propagating with wavenumber k
in the forward and backward direction respectively. Be-
cause k > 0 (k < 0) indicates that the photons are prop-

ﬁelds is ¯hωka†
/n, where
kck, with ωk = c
c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is a constant
eﬀective index, equal for the forward and backward prop-
agating waves. By ignoring the frequency dependence of
n we are neglecting the underlying material dispersion
within the waveguides; we discuss the validity of this ap-
proximation after equation (5) below. To describe light
in the cavity, we deﬁne a creation operator b†, and iden-
tify the energy in the ﬁeld as ¯hω0b†b, where ω0 is the
resonant frequency of the cavity. For the micro-ring res-
onator structure of Fig. 1a (right), the a†
k could
represent creation operators for light propagating in the
forward direction in the lower waveguide and the back-
ward direction in the upper waveguide, while b† could
represent the ﬁeld circulating in the counter-clockwise
direction in the micro-ring resonator. Our notation im-
plies that the two waveguides have a common mode in-
dex n, but this could easily be generalized. For the PC
structure of Fig. 1a (left), the a†
k would represent
creation operators for light propagating in the forward
and backward direction in a waveguide mode of the PC
waveguide, and b† would represent the creation operator
for the ﬁeld inside the single mode defect. Regardless of
their interpretation, the operators satisfy the commuta-

In writing down (2), (3) and (4) we have implicitly
assumed that the cavity supports only one mode, with
resonant frequency ω0, and that the waveguides guide
light in only a single spatial mode proﬁle. Strictly speak-
ing, of course, neither of these assumptions is valid. In
general, cavities support more than one mode, oscillating
at one or more resonance frequencies, and for suﬃciently
high frequencies a waveguide will support multiple trans-
verse modes. However, we are primarily interested in the
physics of these structures for frequencies at or near a
speciﬁc resonant frequency ω0. We then assume that
within this frequency range only one resonance of the
cavity exists or, alternatively, that only a single mode of
a multi-mode cavity is excited, and that the waveguides
of the structure are single mode. Furthermore, we as-
sume that the underlying material or modal dispersion

The transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients in (6),(7)
are of precisely the form that follows from simple transfer
matrix models of resonant cavities or ring resonators6,7.
In the latter structure, for example, the coupling of the
cavity to the waveguides is described by self-coupling and
cross-coupling coeﬃcients σ and κ respectively, which in
a simple case (where the coupling is assumed to occur
at the point of smallest separation) are real and satisfy
σ2 + κ2 = 1. Comparing the transmission and reﬂection
coeﬃcients found there with (6),(7), we ﬁnd that they
become equivalent if we put

where ¯n and R are the eﬀective index and radius of the
resonator respectively. Thus if a given resonator is pa-
rameterized by σ and κ, as well of course by the resonance
frequency ω0, then relation (8) allows one to determine
the eﬀective coupling coeﬃcient ξ ˜ω0 and thus set what
will be, as we will see, the crucial elements in the phe-
nomenological Hamiltonian (2). The appropriate values
of σ and κ for a single resonator could be determined by
experiment, or directly calculated from the underlying
channel and resonator geometries, as discussed by Waks
and Vuckovic12.

A typical spectrum for a single cavity structure is
shown in Fig. 2. On resonance, the reﬂection induced by
the cavity reaches 100% (albeit only for a single wave-
length), and remains signiﬁcant as long as the detuning,
∆, is on the order of γ. The width of the spectrum is
dictated by γ, and the larger the coupling to the cavity,
the broader the resonance. In physical terms, this means
that as the waveguides are brought closer to the cavity
of Fig. 1a, the resonance width increases.

backward propagating modes are coupled to an inﬁnite
series of periodically spaced cavities (Fig. 1b). We as-
sume that the resonators are not directly coupled to each
other, although of course they do couple indirectly via
the waveguides. Generalizing the Hamiltonian (2) to in-
clude the periodic sequence of resonators, we write

with the same resonance frequency, ω0, and associated
with the creation operator b†
l , where l indexes the res-
onator. The resonators are evenly spaced at zl = lΛ,
which gives a fundamental reciprocal lattice vector G0 =
2π/Λ. The Hamiltonian (9) can be re-written as

FIG. 2: Transmission (solid line) and reﬂection (dotted line)
spectrum for the one cell structure obtained using equations
(6) and (7). The structure can demonstrate 100% reﬂection
and 0% transmission when the frequency is matched to the
resonance frequency of the microresonator. For comparison
with later plots, the frequency is normalized with a distance
Λ, which we use as the distance between resonators when we
consider a periodic array.

The dispersion relation of the system can be deter-
mined by traditional transfer matrix methods, using (6),
(7) for the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients of a sin-
gle resonator. However, to see the connection with the
coupled mode equations we will derive, we consider deter-
mining the dispersion relation directly from the Hamilto-
nian (13), by applying the Heisenberg equation of motion
to generate equations for the time derivatives of ak+G,
ck−G and bk. Assuming harmonic time dependence e−iωt

for the operators, we determine an expression for ω as
a complicated function of the countably inﬁnite set of
ω±|k|±G, and the discrete value ω0. Alternately (and
equivalently) we can exhibit the Hamiltonian in a matrix

where G′ is the reciprocal lattice vector associated with
the forward (backward) band that has ωk+G′ (ωk−G′ )

nant frequency is very close to a Bragg frequency with
its associated gap at the Brillouin zone centre, and so
ωb, where ωb is the Bragg frequency clos-

est to the resonance frequency8. We refer to eqn. 16
as the “three mode model.” Its validity near a resonance
frequency for any particular structure can be formally in-
vestigated by including the omitted terms in a multiple
scales analysis, or by simply comparing the dispersion
relation following from eqn. 16 with a full solution of
the dispersion relation using a transfer matrix approach.
This is done in Fig. 4, using the parameters in Table
I as was done in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 4 we also plot the
imaginary part of k within the gaps. Note that the ex-
act solution and that from the three mode model are in
good agreement for the frequency range shown in Fig. 4.
Such agreement fails at other Bragg frequencies that are
further from the resonant gap, of course, since the three
mode model (eqn. 16) only contains the physics of the
Bragg gap closest to ω0. It is to frequencies near ω0 that
we henceforth restrict ourselves.

IV. COUPLED-MODE EQUATIONS IN THE
THREE-MODE MODEL

In this section we derive a set of coupled-mode equa-
tions which describe pulse propagation in the periodic
structure, based on the three-mode Hamiltonian (16).
We then demonstrate that although these coupled mode
equations are derived for an inﬁnite periodic system with
equal coupling at each resonator, they can, with only
slight modiﬁcations, be used to describe ﬁnite systems
with varying coupling at each resonator. We start by
deﬁning eﬀective ﬁelds in terms of the amplitudes ak+G′ ,
ck−G′ and bk:

where G′
indexes the reciprocal lattice vector that is
retained within the three mode approximation. These
ﬁelds can be interpreted as a forward propagating ﬁeld,
a backward propagating ﬁeld, and the ﬁeld distribution
in the resonators respectively. Using the deﬁnitions in
(17), the eﬀective ﬁelds satisfy the equal time commuta-

One can obtain the dispersion relation directly from (20)
by assuming that each ﬁeld is a plane wave eikz−iωt, with
k restricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. The results are
equivalent to those in Fig.4, obtained by diagonalizing
(16).

Although the CME (20) were derived assuming an in-
ﬁnite medium, they can be used to describe a struc-
ture where the coupling constant Ξ varies slowly over
a distance on the order of the spacing between the res-
onators. A multiple scale analysis can be used to iden-
tify this limit and corrections to it. A more striking in-
homogeneous structure is one beginning with a region

It can be easily seen that this model formally violates

and similarily for all other ﬁelds. Then the ﬁrst equation

ted, since the third of (20) together with the position
dependent coupling constant guarantees that b (z) will
only be nonzero in the region between z = 0 and z = L.
Note however that at z = 0 and z = L the equation (21)
leads to a discontinuous ∂g+ (z) /∂z if it is assumed that
g+(z) is everywhere continuous. This violates, of course,
the assumption that ﬁelds such as g+ (z, t) are of the form
(17).

Despite such a formal violation of our assumptions,
this simple model in fact gives a good description of the
optical response of a ﬁnite structure. To see this, consider
ﬁrst the ﬁelds g±(z, t) within the structure. It is clear
from (20) that for a supposed frequency ω there are two
Bloch wavenumbers, which equivalently follow from (16);
they are given by k (¯ω) =

In Fig.

of a two channel micro-ring resonator structure with
30 cavities, calculated both using the transfer matrix

eqn. 24. Again we adopt the parameters of Table I. Gen-
erally there is good qualitative agreement, with the main
features of the spectrum well described by the coupled
mode equation result (24), although as noted above it is
being applied beyond its strict range of applicability. An
extension of this approach leads to the use of the CME
(20) to treat a ﬁnite structure where the coupling con-
stant Ξ varies from one resonator to the next. To describe
this we simply allow Ξ in (20) to adopt a z-dependence,

matrix results is presented, as well as a very simple
application of the CME (25) using a piecewise uniform
function to represent Ξ, where in the nth unit well we
set Ξ = Ξn. Again there is good qualitative agreement,
although the CME are being applied beyond their strict
range of applicability. Besides the diﬀerence between
the CME and transfer matrix results with respect to
the Fabry-Perot type oscillations, as seen in Fig.
5,
here the CME solution also consistently overestimates
the transmission on the high-frequency side of the stop
gap. This can be traced back to the eﬀects on the band
curvature induced by the next highest Bragg gap, which
are implicitly included in the transfer matrix solution
but not in the CME calculation.

Finally, we note that while at least three coupled mode
equations are necessary to describe the kind of struc-
tures we consider here if we deal with both their space
and time dependence, if we instead restrict ourselves to a
stationary time dependence, g± (z, t) = g± (z) e−i¯ωt and
b(z, t) = b(z)e−i¯ωt, then in fact we can eliminate the
variable b (z, t) and construct coupled mode equations
involving only g+ (z, t) and g− (z, t). They are

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented a phenomenological Hamiltonian
description of
light propagation in side-coupled res-
onators. This formulation is appealing in its simplicity,
since it captures the basic physics of the structures via
a set of readily understandably parameters. The most
interesting special case is perhaps where a resonator gap
is close to a Bragg gap, and at frequencies close to these
gaps a three mode model gives a good description of the
dynamics of a periodic structure of resonators. Coupled
mode equations based on these captures the dispersion
relation even deep within the gaps, and a naive extension
of these equations to describe ﬁnite structures, although
not within the strict range of applicability of the model,
gives a good qualitative description.

A hallmark of the kind of approach we have taken
here is the connection of theoretically calculated or ex-
perimentally observed parameters, such as the coupling
coeﬃcient σ, to the parameters that appear in our phe-
nomenological Hamiltonian. Such a strategy is particu-
larly amenable to the description of quantum and non-
linear optical eﬀects. The Hamiltonian description leads
to straightforward quantization, of course, and appropri-
ate nonlinear terms can easily be added to the Hamilto-
nian. In a previous study by Grimshaw et al.22, it was
shown that three nonlinear coupled mode equations sup-
port stationary solitary wave solution in the presence of
Kerr nonlinearity. Numerical studies have indicated that
soliton-like waves exist in resonator structures. In future
work we plan to apply the approach we have detailed
here to study such ﬁeld excitations, where a Hamiltonian
framework provides the ability to characterize conserved
quantities in terms of the symmetries of the nonlinear
ﬁeld theory.

VII. APPENDIX 1

In this appendix we use the Hamiltonian (2) to deter-
mine the transmission properties of a single-cavity struc-
ture. These transmission properties have been inten-
sively studied using various methods such as ﬁnite dif-
ference, time domain simulations14, and scattering ma-
trix techniques26, and it is well-known that a Lorentzian
function gives an excellent approximation to the response
of the structure. Here we show that our Hamiltonian also
leads to a Lorentzian spectrum. To discuss transmission
and reﬂection, we assume that there is a time-dependent

10

source, u (t), coupled to the forward propagating modes
at zs < z0. We therefore modify the Hamiltonian (2) to
include a source term:

describing the small shift in the resonance frequency of
the cavity due to the presence of the waveguide. To es-
timate the eﬀect of α(ω), we assume ξk takes a gaussian
form in k space with a peak centered at k = ˜ω0. We take
the width of the gaussian proﬁle to be about 1µm−1,
associated with a typical length over which the coupling
between the waveguide and resonator is signiﬁcant. Us-
ing this approximate form for ξk in the expression for

α(ω) and numerically evaluating the integral, we have
veriﬁed that α(ω) is much smaller than the resonance
frequency ω0 for structures of interest. Note that in (32)
we have switched our notation for wavenumber from k to
ω = nω/c =
to stress that we are now considering the
frequency response of the structure. To determine the
transmission and reﬂection spectrum of the structure we

The ﬁrst (second) of the expressions in (35) is the trans-

From these coeﬃcients, it is clear that the cavity aﬀects
the transmission/reﬂection of the structure when the de-
tuning, ∆, is on the order of 2πnξ2
˜ω/c. In the limit of very
weak coupling – that is, when the value of 2πnξ2
˜ω/c is ap-
proximately constant over a frequency range centered at
ω0 and spanning several multiples of 2πnξ2
˜ω/c, then the
transmission and reﬂection are well approximated by a
Lorentzian lineshape

for our assumed ∆k

(see equation (8) and Table I).

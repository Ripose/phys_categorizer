We experimentally demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that a radially polarized ﬁeld can be focussed
to a spot size signiﬁcantly smaller (0.16(1)λ2) than for linear polarization (0.26λ2). The eﬀect of
the vector properties of light is shown by a comparison of the focal intensity distribution for radially
and azimuthally polarized input ﬁelds. For strong focusing a radially polarized ﬁeld leads to a
longitudinal electric ﬁeld component at the focus which is sharp and centered at the optical axis.
The relative contribution of this component is enhanced by using an annular aperture.

PACS numbers: 42.25.Ja; 42.15.Dp

A large number of optical instruments and devices
make use of a sharply focussed light beam. Prominent
examples are in lithography, confocal microscopy, opti-
cal data storage as well as in particle trapping. A highly
concentrated and well matched ﬁeld is also a necessary re-
quirement for manipulating nanoscopic quantum systems
in quantum information processing or cavity quantum
electrodynamics [1]. When reaching for the limits the
polarization properties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld play
a dominant role. For a vectorial description of strong fo-
cusing using high numerical apertures diﬀerent methods
have been developed [2, 3, 4, 5]. It turns out that in gen-
eral all three mutually orthogonal ﬁeld components ap-
pear at the focal region. The electric energy density pat-
terns of individual polarization components were mapped
using single molecules with the absorption dipole axis
pointing in the three diﬀerent directions [6, 7, 8]. For
linearly polarized light, the energy density distribution
of a longitudinally polarized component in the direction
of propagation of the beam is not rotationally symmet-
ric. This primarily causes an asymmetric deformation
of the focal spot. When using an annular aperture, the
relative contribution of the longitudinal component is in-
creased and the asymmetry becomes more pronounced
[9]. These asymmetries were recently conﬁrmed experi-
mentally [10]. In addition, it was predicted that a special
polarization pattern is needed for focusing down to the
smallest possible spot [11].

The eﬀects of the vector properties of light on the
structure of the focus are best observed if one compares
two special input beams with identical intensity distribu-
tion but diﬀerent polarization properties. A good exam-
ple for two such ﬁelds are an azimuthally and a radially
polarized ﬁeld with identical doughnut shaped intensity
distributions. When focusing with a high numerical aper-
ture the radially polarized input ﬁeld leads to a strong
longitudinal electric ﬁeld component in the vicinity of the
focus [11, 12]. In contrast, the azimuthally polarized ﬁeld
generates a strong magnetic ﬁeld on the optical axis [13]

while the electric ﬁeld is purely transverse and zero at
centre [14]. In general, the direction of the polarization
may vary largely inside the focal spot. Especially when
sub–wavelength–structures are investigated this has to be
carefully considered in a quantitative analysis [15]. The
predicted axial light forces acting on particles in an op-
tical tweezer set up are diﬀerent in a vectorial treatment
as compared to theories based on paraxial and geometric
optics [16]. The speciﬁc interaction of the diﬀerent ﬁeld
components at the focus with single molecules can pro-
vide information about the orientation of the absorption
dipole of the molecules [6, 7]. Although these ﬁeld com-
ponents may also occur in the vicinity of near ﬁeld aper-
tures [17], a far ﬁeld technique can be advantageous as it
avoids a modiﬁcation of the dynamics of the molecule due
to an interaction with the probe [18, 19]. For the spec-
troscopy of magnetic dipole transitions in quantum dots
it was proposed to use an azimuthally polarized ﬁeld for
the excitation and take advantage of the strong magnetic
and the vanishing electric ﬁeld component on axis [13].
To couple eﬃciently to small quantum systems such as
single atoms the incoming ﬁeld must be well matched in
both its amplitude and phase but also in its polarization
properties [1].

The vector properties not only aﬀect the local ﬁeld
direction but also the intensity distribution at the fo-
cus. This is experimentally demonstrated here below by
comparing highly resolved measurements for azimuthally
and radially polarized input ﬁelds. The radially polar-
ized beam can have a narrow central peak due to the
appearance of the strong longitudinal ﬁeld component
that is sharply centered around the optical axis. The
experimental results reported here conﬁrm for the ﬁrst
time, to the best of our knowledge, that a radially polar-
ized input ﬁeld leads to the smallest possible spot size in
far ﬁeld focusing observed so far. Three diﬀerent types
of set up have been described with which a radially or
azimuthally polarized doughnut mode can be produced
[29]. Most of them either generate the mode inside a
laser resonator [20, 21] or use a Mach–Zehnder like in-
terferometer [22, 23]. A third approach involves the use
of mode–forming holographic and birefringent elements
[24].

Here we use another approach for the generation of
this polarization mode. The TEM00–beam of a linearly
polarized, single mode helium–neon laser (λ=632.8nm)
is expanded and collimated by a telescope with an addi-
tional pinhole as a mode cleaner (Fig. 1). The collimated
beam is then sent through a polarization converter. This
element consists of four half–wave plates, one in each
quadrant. The optical axis of each segment is oriented
such that the ﬁeld is rotated to point in the radial direc-
tion. However, due to the limited number of segments
and some diﬀraction losses at the boundaries between
adjacent segments, the ﬁeld is not perfectly radially po-
larized. Nevertheless, this ﬁeld has a large overlapp with
the desired mode and a smaller overlapp with additional
higher order transverse modes. These undesired modes
are ﬁltered out by sending the beam through a non– con-
focal Fabry–Perot interferometer that is operated as a
mode–cleaner and which is kept resonant only for the
radially or azimuthally polarized doughnut–mode. With
this method, a purity of >99% is achieved.

The beam was collimated such that the beam radius
at the maximum intensity was 1.2mm. To ensure mini-
mum wave front aberrations we analyzed the beam with a
Shack–Hartmann wave front sensor yielding a root mean
square wave front error < λ/35. By rotating the polar-
ization of the beam before the polarization converter by
90◦, it is possible to switch between a radially and an
azimuthally polarized beam. For measurements with an
annular aperture, a stop is placed directly in front of the
microscope objective to block the inner part of the beam.
The stop is a high quality glass substrate (surface accu-
racy of < λ/20) coated with an opaque disc (di=3.0mm
or 3.3mm). The diameter of the entrance pupil of the
focusing microscope objective (NA=0.9) is 3.6mm. To
measure the focal intensity distribution [30] we used an
experimental set up which is based on the knife edge
method. The edge is formed by a sharp edged opaque
pad that is deposited on the active surface of a photodi-
ode. Therefore no subsequent optical system is needed to
collect the transmitted light and eﬀects due to diﬀraction
at the edge are minimized. A more detailed description
of the properties of the sensor is given in [10]. The knife

edge method allows one to measure the one dimensional
projection i.e. the line integrated intensity of the two di-
mensional intensity distribution onto the direction along
which the edge is moved. By measuring a set of pro-
jections onto diﬀerent directions one acquires the input
data needed for a tomographic reconstruction of the two
dimensional intensity distribution, using e.g. the Radon
back–transformation formalism [25].

For rotationally symmetric input ﬁelds the focal spot
also shows rotational symmetry and all projections onto
any line are identical. Therefore one representative mea-
surement would in principle suﬃce. But we measured
projections onto two orthogonal lines to exclude the pos-
sibility that the symmetry of the focussed ﬁeld is aﬀected
by non–spherical aberrations introduced e.g. by the mi-
croscope objective. The results were identical within the
limits of reproducibility. Line integrals of the intensity
distribution were also measured for diﬀerent positions of
the knife edge sensor with respect to the focal plane. This
yields a line integrated cross section of the propagating
beam containing the optical axis (Fig. 2).

FIG. 2: Defocus series for a radially (a) and azimuthally (b)
polarized input ﬁeld. The insets illustrate how the polariza-
tion of the input beam varies spatially across the beam cross
section. Note that identical initial intensity distributions lead
to diﬀerent distributions at focus.

An evidence for the strong longitudinal electric ﬁeld
at the focus of the radially polarized beam is the fact
that the intensity projection shows a maximum on the
optical axis in the focal plane (Fig. 2a).
In contrast,
the azimuthally polarized beam has no longitudinal ﬁeld
component and on the optical axis the intensity projec-
tion has a minimum. The measured projections in the
focal plane are shown in ﬁgure 3 for the two modes along
with the calculated distributions of the transverse and
longitudinal ﬁeld components. The curves were normal-
ized such that for each case the total intensity in the focal
spot equals 1 (arbitrary unit). Cross sections for the to-
mographically reconstructed intensity distributions (Fig.
3) show that the intensity on the optical axis vanishes
for the azimuthally polarized beam. The beam proﬁle at
the focus is very similar to the doughnut shaped proﬁle
of the input beam just as one would naively expect based
on the scalar diﬀraction theory.
In contrast, the radially polarized mode leads to a narrow
peak around the optical axis where the ﬁeld is basically
directed into a longitudinal direction. The transverse
ﬁeld components show a proﬁle very similar to the proﬁle

FIG. 3: Measured projections (a,c) and cross sections
through the tomographically reconstructed intensity distri-
butions (b,d) in the focal plane for an azimuthally (a,b) and
a radially (c,d) polarized input ﬁeld. Open squares: experi-
mental data; calculated curves: solid black line: total ﬁeld;
dashed line: transverse ﬁeld; solid triangles: longitudinal ﬁeld

of the azimuthally polarized beam. The power contained
in the longitudinal ﬁeld is calculated to be 49.6% of the
total beam power. The relative contribution of the longi-
tudinal component can be enhanced when the numerical
aperture of the focusing system is increased.
For a numerical aperture of 0.9 as in this experiment the
calculated spot size [31] associated with this longitudi-
nal ﬁeld alone is 0.2λ2 which is below the spot size for a
linearly polarized input ﬁeld with homogeneous intensity
distribution (0.31λ2). The spot size of the total ﬁeld is
still larger (0.47λ2) than for linear polarization due to
the broad distribution of the additional transverse ﬁeld
component. We note in passing that, in general, a cal-
culation using a scalar ﬁeld tends to underestimate the
spot size for large numerical apertures. The reason is
that due to the vector properties of light the plane waves
that form the focussed ﬁeld in image space cannot inter-
fere perfectly at the focus as the electric (and magnetic)
ﬁeld vectors are not all parallel at the focus.

In the case of the radially polarized doughnut mode
the rays that propagate under a small angle to the op-
tical axis show only a small longitudinal component.
The stronger transverse ﬁeld components associated with
these waves all cancel out on the optical axis and form a
broad, doughnut shaped proﬁle which increases the spot
size. But when an annular aperture is used for focusing,
only waves that propagate under a large angle to the
optical axis contribute to the focal ﬁeld. For a high nu-
merical aperture and a large inner radius of the annular
aperture the electric ﬁeld vectors for a radially polarized
input ﬁeld are essentially parallel to the optical axis. All
rays interfere perfectly and consequently the spot size is

power. Open squares: experimental data; calculated curves:

a scalar theory. Cross sections through the tomographi-
cally reconstructed intensity distributions are shown for
an azimuthally (Fig. 4) and for a radially (Fig. 5) polar-
ized input ﬁeld when using the annular aperture. Com-
pared to the case without annular aperture the sidelobes
are more pronounced in both cases, indicating that the
relative contribution of the intensity in the side lobes has
increased at the expense of a decreased central maximum.

The spot size for radial polarization with annular aper-
ture is reduced to 0.16(1)λ2 (theoretical value 0.17λ2)
(Fig. 5b). This is well below 0.26λ2, the theoretically
achievable spot size for linear polarization under the same
experimental conditions and also well below 0.22λ2, the
theoretical value for circularly polarized light. The latter
is a little smaller as compared to linear polarization due
to the deﬁnition of the spot size used here.

Expressed in units of λ2 this is to our knowledge the
smallest measured spot size that has been reached in far
ﬁeld focusing in air (NA<1).

It is worth noting that for a radially polarized input
ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld vectors point in the azimuthal
direction just as the electric ﬁeld vectors do for an az-
imuthally polarized input beam. The magnetic energy
density distribution for a radially polarized beam shows
the same distribution as the electric energy density distri-
bution for an azimuthally polarized beam and vice versa.
In summary, we have experimentally veriﬁed the inﬂu-
ence of the polarization on the shape of the focal spot.
For a radially polarized ﬁeld distribution with annular
aperture, the focal spot size was reduced to the small-
est focal spot observed up to now when normalizing to
the wavelength (λ2). The experimentally observed spot

4

size for NA=0.9 is about 35% below the theoretical limit
for linearly polarized light. The calculated spot size for
the longitudinal ﬁeld alone is 0.14λ2. Therefore, if a sur-
face is covered with a special photosensitive layer which
is only sensitive to the narrow longitudinal ﬁeld distribu-
tion [11] even smaller spot sizes can be reached. These
ideas may well be combined with other concepts for the
increase of transverse resolution such as the solid immer-
sion lens [26] or coupling to small mesoscopic antennae
[27]. A radially polarized ﬁeld will also provide the input
ﬁeld which is best suited for coupling into the recently
proposed all–dielectric waveguide [28].

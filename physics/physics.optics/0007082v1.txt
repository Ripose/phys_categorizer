Complex photonic band structures (CPBS) of transmission metallic gratings with rectangular
slits are shown to exhibit strong discontinuities that are not evidenced in the usual energetic band
structures. These discontinuities are located on Wood’s anomalies and reveal unambiguously two
diﬀerent types of resonances, which are identiﬁed as horizontal and vertical surface-plasmon reso-
nances. Spectral position and width of peaks in the transmission spectrum can be directly extracted
from CPBS for both kinds of resonances.

Recently, metallic ﬁlms with sub-wavelength apertures became the subject of increasing interest. Experiments show
that 2D arrays of sub-wavelength holes in metallic ﬁlms can lead to extraordinary transmission of light [1–5]. These
properties have been attributed to the excitation of coupled surface-plasmons on the upper and lower surfaces of the
grating. The ability of these structures to control light has been shown [6,7], and applications have already been
proposed in order to exploit these properties in diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as electromagnetic ﬁlters or photolithography.

Electromagnetic calculations have been carried out by Porto et al. [8] in order to study the mechanisms that
enhance the transmission of light through metallic gratings with very narrow slits. They distinguished two diﬀerent
mechanisms, that is the excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons on both surfaces of the metallic grating, and
the coupling of incident plane waves with waveguide resonances located in the slits. They correspond respectively to
surface-plasmon bands and ﬂat bands in the energetic band structure. Similar resonances located in grooves have also
been observed experimentally and numerically in the reﬂected light of metallic gratings [9–11].

Complex photonic band structures (CPBS) were previously calculated by Kuzmiak et al. for 2D periodic systems
with metallic components [12], in order to obtain the attenuation and the lifetime of each mode. CPBS allowed a
splitting of the lifetime of degenerate modes at Brillouin-zone boundaries to be observed.

In this Letter, we will show that, in the case of rectangular metallic gratings, complex dispersion curves demonstrate
the existence of a new kind of discontinuities. Much stronger than for 2D periodic systems, they are located on Wood’s
anomalies. They correspond to the transition between two diﬀerent types of resonances, identiﬁed as horizontal and
vertical surface-plasmon resonances. The ﬁrst one is a periodic structure resonance, the second one is a Fabry-
Perot like resonance. The discontinuity can be up to four orders of magnitude. Moreover, we will see on zero-order
transmission spectra that the calculated complex frequencies are in excellent accordance not only with the spectral
position, but also with the width of resonances’ peaks.

Fig. 1 shows the structure studied in this Letter, which is similar to the one of Porto et al. [8]. In the following,
the period of the grating d = 3.5 µm and the width of the slits a = 0.5 µm will be kept constant, whereas the height
h of the grating will vary. It is a symmetric structure, surrounded with air. The metal is assumed to be gold, whose
dielectric function is taken from the reference used by Porto [13].

Our calculations were carried out for the TM polarization (the incident magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the direction y
of the grating, see Fig. 1). They are based on the exact modal expansion in region II [14] and S-matrices formalism.
In the upper and lower regions (I and III), the electromagnetic ﬁeld is expressed as superposition of plane waves
e[i(k(n)
x , which represents the in-plane
momentum of photons is given by Eq. (1):

z z)−iωt] (Rayleigh’s expansion). Their pure real wave vector component k(n)

The two other terms k(n)

z

x (cid:17)2
and ω are complex quantities, according to the relation (cid:16)k(n)

z (cid:17)2
+ (cid:16)k(n)

= (ω/c)2.

For the calculation of CPBS, we use a S-matrix formalism, in which the amplitude of the reﬂected and transmitted
diﬀracted waves are given by a matrix S applied to a vector containing the amplitude of the upper and lower incident
waves. An electromagnetic mode is deﬁned by the condition of the existence of a wave in the structure without any
incident wave, which is equivalent to say that the inverse (S−1) of the S-matrix has an eigenvalue that is null, with
an eigenvector (Rn, Tn), corresponding to an electromagnetic ﬁeld in regions I and III:

Tn e[i(k(n)

x x−k(n)

z z)−iω0t],

(2)

For a given kx = k(0)

x , the electromagnetic modes are deﬁned by complex frequencies ω0. The inverse of the
imaginary part of the frequency provides the amplitude lifetime 2τ of the resonance [15,12], which can be associated
to the dimensionless quality factor Q = ℜ(ω0) τ .

The complex dispersion curves are lines in the three-dimensional space deﬁned by the complex frequency ω0 of
resonance modes and the parallel momentum of photons kx. For a more comprehensive representation we are plotting
two projections of ω0, the energy E = ¯h ℜ(ω0) and the dimensionless quality factor Q = ℜ(ω0)/(−2 ℑ(ω0)).

Fig. 2 shows the complex dispersion curves calculated for a height h = 1.4 µm. The lines on the energetic band
structure (Fig. 2(a)) represents the frontier of the Wood-Rayleigh’s anomalies. They correspond to the emergence (or
the vanishing) of a diﬀracted wave in the region I or III, which wave is then at the grazing angle. These anomalies
are observed on transmission spectra when the nth parallel wave vector k(n)
(given by Eq. (1)) is equal to the real
incident wave vector k0.

The energetic band structure in Fig. 2(a) shows two diﬀerent types of modes, whose dispersion relations have already
been studied by Porto. The bands located close to Wood’s anomalies, with slightly smaller energies, characterize
horizontal surface-plasmon resonances. They are excited by the ﬁrst non-propagating (or evanescent) diﬀracted wave,
and their quality factors are greater than 10 and up to more than 104 (see Fig. 2(b)). On the other hand, ﬂat bands
represent electromagnetic modes which are almost independent of the incident angle θ, and with lower quality factors
(below 20). They were previously reported as waveguide resonances [8]. We will justify further in this Letter why
these resonances are more precisely vertical surface-plasmon resonances.

The most remarkable result is given by the quality factor of the upper energetic band, which is broken into three
parts. Considering the point A in Fig. 2(a), we see that the energetic band is continuous whereas the quality
factor’s curve is discontinuous at the corresponding points A’ and A” in Fig. 2(b). On the left side of point A, the
ﬂat band corresponds to a vertical resonance with very low quality factors (of the order of 3), whereas the right side
corresponds to an horizontal surface-plasmon resonance with high quality factors (up to more than 104). The lifetimes
of the resonances are τ = 2.9 fs at A’ and τ = 33 ps at A”.

In order to understand physically the behavior of the electromagnetic waves, it must be pointed out that the
discontinuous transitions between the two types of resonance are located exactly on Wood’s anomalies (point A
and its symmetrical point B), so that they are linked to the emergence or the vanishing of a diﬀracted wave. This
phenomenon can be explained in considering the energetic band structure: below Wood’s anomaly, the ﬁrst non-
propagating (evanescent in z direction) diﬀracted wave (n = +1 at the point A and n = -2 at the point B) is
responsible for the excitation of the horizontal surface-plasmon resonance. When the resonance crosses Wood’s
anomaly, the evanescent wave becomes a z-direction propagating diﬀracted wave (at grazing angle) which can not
excite an horizontal resonance anymore, but is coupled to vertical surface-plasmons located on the vertical walls of
slits. Then, we obtain a ﬂat band which corresponds to a ”weaker” resonance in the Fabry-Perot like cavity delimited
by the top and bottom surfaces of the grating. This vertical resonance is coupled with the last propagating diﬀracted
wave, thus it ends at the crossing with Wood’s anomaly, where this wave vanishes.

The complex band structure in Fig. 2 has also a continuous transition between the horizontal and the vertical
resonances in the lower band. The ﬂat band at normal incidence corresponds to vertical resonances, and becomes a
surface-plasmon band for greater incident angles. Its quality factor increases from 20 to about 300 during this smooth
transition. The last ﬂat band at about 0.35 eV corresponds to a vertical resonance for the whole range of kx in Fig. 2.
By varying the width a of the slits, we have observed that the complex mode of the vertical resonance is nearly
unchanged. In the calculation, it can be seen from the modal decomposition of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, that this
resonance corresponds mainly to the excitation of the ﬁrst eigenmode of a z inﬁnitely extended region II. The wave is
evanescent in the x direction and propagates at the vertical interfaces air/metal (z direction). This TM mode exists
for any width of slit, and becomes equal to the wave vector kps of the surface-plasmon of a semi-inﬁnite air-metal
interface in the limit of wide slits, so that it is more correct to call it a vertical surface-plasmon mode instead of a
waveguide mode. The transitions between the regions II/I and II/III act as mirrors for the vertical surface-plasmon
mode. Their reﬂection coeﬃcients are low, so that the vertical resonance is a Fabry-Perot like resonance with low
quality factors.

Complex dispersion curves shown above can be seen as convenient compact representations of the resonances, which
can be associated to transmission spectra. For that purpose, we make the hypothesis that the complex frequency ωi
0
of a resonance i is a single pole of the amplitude of the transmitted waves. Consequently, the zero-order transmitted
energy can be approximated by a Lorentzian function near the resonance i. Assuming ω is the (real valued) frequency
of the incident wave, we obtain:

T0 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

αi

ω − ωi
0

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

The complex band structure of the grating is shown in Fig. 3 for a height h = 3 µm. Fig. 4 shows the zero-order
transmission spectra calculated for the same height and two diﬀerent angles of incidence. They correspond to θ = 0◦
(a) and θ = 12◦ (b) cuttings in Fig. 3(a). The Lorentzian curves corresponding to Eq. (3) are added to the spectra.
The constant αi is ﬁtted to obtain the same maximum value as the spectra. At normal incidence (Fig. 4(a)), the
broad resonances at 0.38 eV and 0.54 eV (not represented in Fig. 3) are not separated enough to allow the comparison
to their respective Lorentzian functions to be made. In such a case, the amplitude of the transmitted wave is the sum
of two complex Lorentzian functions, and phase considerations make it more diﬃcult to ﬁt to the spectra.

For the other peaks, Fig. 4 shows an excellent agreement of the Lorentzian curves with the spectra. Hence, the

single-pole approximation is justiﬁed and Eq. (3) gives the width at half maximum:

∆ω0 = − 2 ℑ(ωi

0).

(4)

It justiﬁes also the above deﬁnition of the quality factor of the resonance, which corresponds to the more conventional
Q = E/∆E.

These transmission spectra allow some important characteristics of the resonances to be pointed out. At ﬁrst, it
must be noted that the ﬂat band at about 0.35 eV has no solution at normal incidence, and the peak γ disappears
at θ = 0◦. An energetic shift can be seen for the horizontal surface-plasmon resonances between θ = 0◦ and θ = 12◦,
whereas the vertical resonance at about 0.17 eV does not move. Another point which comes out of the calculations
is that vertical resonances in contiguous slits are nearly uncoupled. As a consequence, a periodic structure is not
necessary for them to exist: the vertical surface-plasmon resonance could be excited in an unique slit, and fully coupled
with a few ones. Hence, an important result is that the vertical resonance can be eﬃciently excited by a strongly
focalized beam.

In conclusion, we have carried out the calculation of the complex dispersion curves of rectangular metallic gratings
in TM polarization. CPBS are directly linked to experimental data, like transmission spectra. The quality factor and
the lifetime of resonances, that they provide, are crucial characteristics in many applications already proposed for the
extraordinary eﬀects appearing in such transmission metallic gratings. CPBS show pronounced discontinuities located
on Wood’s anomalies, which can not be evidenced in the usual energetic dispersion curves. They allow to distinguish
unambiguously the two diﬀerent natures of resonances: horizontal and vertical surface-plasmon resonances. Similar
results can be obtained for reﬂection gratings. This work can also be extended in order to analyze resonances in
more complex geometries, as Ebbesen’s structures [1] for example, for which a cutoﬀ diameter exists for vertical
modes. The characteristics of the resonances studied in this Letter open up new possibilities in photonic materials.
Moreover, these structures allow huge concentrations of light in very small volumes, which could have applications in
fundamental optics [16] and in optoelectronics.

We study coupling and decoupling of parallel waveguides in two-dimensional
square-lattice photonic crystals. We show that the waveguide coupling is
prohibited at some wavelengths when there is an odd number of rows between
the waveguides. In contrast, decoupling does not take place when there is even
number of rows between the waveguides. Decoupling can be used to avoid

cross talk between adjacent waveguides.

Two-dimensional photonic crystals are promising candidates for implementing
integrated optical components.1 Optical waveguiding in two-dimensional photonic
crystals is achieved by introducing line defects in the structure that is otherwise
periodic in two dimensions.2 Two parallel waveguides can be used as a directional
waveguide coupler.3–7 On the other hand, it might be desirable to decouple the two
waveguides to minimize cross talk between them, for instance when envisioning closely
packed photonic wires in integrated optical circuits.8

We study the coupling between two parallel waveguides in a square-lattice pho-
tonic crystal and ﬁnd that the decoupling of the waveguides depends on the number of
rods between the waveguides. If there is an odd number of rods between the waveg-
uides, they are decoupled at a deﬁned wavelength. In case of an even number of
rods, the waveguides are coupled at all wavelengths. Previous studies such as5 have
considered an even number of rods and therefore not demonstrated the decoupling
behavior.

The studied geometry is a two-dimensional photonic crystal of cylindrical dielec-
tric rods in a square-lattice in air. The dielectric constant of the rods is taken to be
ǫ = 8.9ǫ0, their radius r = 0.2a and the lattice constant a = 512 nm. The photonic
crystal has a large TE (electric ﬁeld aligned with the cylinders) band gap around
ω = 0.8πc/a, where a is the lattice constant of the crystal. With a = 512 nm, this
gap is in the wavelength range from 1100 nm to 1600 nm. Two parallel waveguides are
formed in the structure by removing two parallel rows of rods. The number of rods
between the two waveguides is varied. In Fig. 1 (a) and (c) we show two examples
of the geometries, i.e. one and two rows of rods between the waveguides. We have
considered 1-7 rows of rods between the waveguides.

The guided eigenmodes supported by this geometry have two possible parities
with respect to the symmetry axis between the waveguides. These modes can be
classiﬁed by the parity of the z-component of the electric ﬁeld, Ez. Following directly

points out of the plane.

from Maxwell’s equations, the parity of Hx is always opposite to the parity of Ez,
and the parity of Hy is always the same as that of Ez. According to the parity of Ez,
the two eigenmodes can be labeled “even” and “odd”. Here z is the direction of the
cylinders (out of plane), x is along the waveguides and y is orthogonal to the cylinders
and the waveguides.

When the system only supports two guided modes, any signal Ψ(x, y, t) with a
deﬁnite frequency ω propagating in the system can be written as a superposition of
these two eigenmodes

Ψ(x, y, t) = ψE(x, y, t) exp(ikEx) + ψO(x, y, t) exp(ikOx).

(1)

Here, ψE and ψO stand for even and odd eigenmodes and kE and kO for the corre-
sponding values of k. The spatial dependence of ψE and ψO is lattice-periodic. This
kind of a superposition gives rise to beating between the eigenmodes. The plane wave
terms in Eq. (1) are in the same phase when x = 0 and in the opposite phase when
x = π/|kO − kE|. The beating wavelength is therefore

κ =

2π
|kO − kE|

.

(2)

When the eigenmodes are in the same phase, their superposition has most of its energy
in one of the waveguides and when in opposite phase, in the other. The propagating
signal oscillates between the two waveguides with the characteristic wavelength κ
given above. This is the mechanism applied e.g. in waveguide couplers. Note that
coupling can be realized also by defects between the waveguides9 or coupling can be
between a waveguide and a defect.10

The beating wavelength κ becomes inﬁnite when kE = kO. This means that there
is no energy transfer between the waveguides, i.e. the waveguides are decoupled. For
the k-values to be identical, the bands of the even and odd eigenmodes have to cross.
If they avoid crossing, κ is always ﬁnite and the two waveguides cannot be decoupled.
We have calculated the band structures of two parallel waveguides in a square-
lattice photonic crystal with the MIT Photonic Bands11 program. The band structures
for the case of one and two rods between the waveguides are shown in Fig. 1 (b) and
(d), respectively. It can be seen that the bands for the even and odd eigenmodes cross
in Fig. 1 (b), but do not cross in Fig. 1 (d). We calculated the band structures for
1-7 rows between the waveguides and found that, for geometries with an odd number
rods between the waveguides, the bands for odd and even eigenmodes cross, whereas
they never cross when there is an even number of rods between the waveguides.

We calculated the coupling wavelengths κ [Eq. (2)] from the band structures
(Fig. 1) and also with the Finite-Diﬀerence Time-Domain Method.12 Results from
both methods are shown in Fig. 2 for the same geometries as considered in Fig. 1.
There is a singularity, corresponding to decoupling, in case there is an odd number
of rows between the waveguides [see Fig. 2 (a)]. In Fig. 2 (b) the value of κ is always
ﬁnite. We found such behavior for 1-7 rows of rods between the waveguides. We
performed the same calculations with FDTD for 1-4 rows between the waveguides.
The calculations using the band structures and FDTD simulations are in excellent
agreement.13

In order to explain the strong eﬀect of the geometry one has to consider the ﬁeld
distributions of the eigenmodes. The Ez and Hy components of the odd eigenmode
have a node in the symmetry plane of the structure. The parity of the Hx component
is the opposite of the parities of the Ez and Hy components. When there is an odd
number of rods between the waveguides, the nodes of the Ez and Hy components
of the odd eigenmode are in the center of a dielectric rod. For the even eigenmode,
the Ez and Hy components are nonzero at the symmetry plane. It is known that the
more the ﬁelds are inside the material of high dielectric constant, the smaller the
energy. Thus at small values of the wave vector, the energy of the even eigenmode
is smaller than that of the odd eigenmode. The bands cross at some value of the
wave vector. This is because the relative power of the Hy component compared to
the power of the Hx component increases with increasing values of the wave vector.
Then Hy starts to determine the eﬀective parity of the mode. Thus at large values of
the wave vector the eﬀective parities of the eigenmodes change and thus the bands
cross. When there is an even number of rods between the waveguides, the node of
the odd eigenmode is in air and the eﬀective parity does not have such an eﬀect to
the energies of the eigenmodes. In this case the odd eigenmode has a lower energy
at all values of the wave vector. This explanation corresponds to the behavior of
the eigenmodes in the particular geometry considered in this paper. In general, our
ﬁndings demonstrate that symmetry properties of a photonic crystal waveguide pair,
especially parity eﬀects, can be used to design the waveguide properties, for instance,
to produce complete decoupling. In this sense photonic crystal waveguides posses an
additional degree of freedom compared to traditional dielectric waveguides.

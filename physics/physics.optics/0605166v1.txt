ABSTRACT: A composite material comprising randomly distributed spherical particles of two

diﬀerent isotropic dielectric–magnetic materials is homogenized using the second–order strong–

property–ﬂuctuation theory in the long–wavelength approximation. Whereas neither of the two

constituent materials by itself supports planewave propagation with negative phase velocity (NPV),

the homogenized composite material (HCM) can. The propensity of the HCM to support NPV

propagation is sensitive to the distributional statistics of the constituent material particles, as

characterized by a two–point covariance function and its associated correlation length. The scope

for NPV propagation diminishes as the correlation length increases.

Keywords: homogenization, strong–property–ﬂuctuation theory, negative refraction

1. INTRODUCTION

The descriptions of electromagnetic planewave propagation traditionally encountered in stan-

dard textbooks generally involve positive phase velocity (PPV) — that is, the phase velocity casts

a positive projection onto the time–averaged Poynting vector. On the other hand, there is growing

recognition of the importance of negative–phase–velocity (NPV) propagation, wherein the phase

velocity casts a negative projection onto the time–averaged Poynting vector [1, 2]. Of the many

exotic phenomenons that follow as a consequence of NPV, negative refraction has been the focus

of particular attention because of its scientiﬁc as well as technological signiﬁcance [3].

Manifestations of NPV are not readily observed in naturally occurring homogeneous materials.

In contrast, artiﬁcial metamaterials may be conceptualized — and in some instances physically

realized — which support NPV propagation. To date, experimental developments with NPV–

supporting homogeneous metamaterials have been limited to wavelengths larger than in the visible

regime, with the micromorphology based on elements of complicated shapes [4, 5, 6].

In a recent study, we proposed a simple recipe for a NPV–supporting metamaterial, based on the

homogenization of a random assembly of two diﬀerent types of spherical particles [7]. The two types

of constituent particles, type a and type b, are each made of an isotropic, homogeneous dielectric–

magnetic material, the relative permittivities being denoted by ǫa,b and the relative permeabilities

by µa,b. Provided that ǫa,b and µa,b lie within certain parameter ranges, with the real parts of

ǫa,b being negative–valued and the real parts of µa,b being positive–valued (or vice versa), the bulk

constituent materials do not support NPV propagation whereas the corresponding homogenized

composite material (HCM) does. The constitutive parameters of the HCM were estimated using

the well–established Bruggeman homogenization formalism [8]. The Bruggeman approach has the

advantages other recent approaches involving NPV–supporting metamaterials [9, 10] that (i) the

constituent particles are not resonant, and (ii) it is not limited to dilute composites.

The sizes of the constituent material particles play a signiﬁcant role in determining whether

or not HCMs support NPV propagation [9, 10]. Using an extended Bruggeman approach [11],

we recently reported that increasing the particle size diminishes the scope for NPV propagation

2

in the HCM [12]. The role of the distributional statistics of the constituent material particles in

NPV–supporting metamaterials has also been highlighted recently [10] — it is this topic that we

explore herein.

The Bruggeman homogenization formalism takes into account the distributional statistics of the

constituent material particles only at the lowest order, via the volume fractions of the constituent

materials. A diﬀerent approach is provided by the strong–property–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) in

which a comprehensive description of the distributional statistics of the constituent material par-

ticles may be accommodated. The provenance of the SPFT lies in wave–propagation studies for

continuous random mediums [13, 14], but it has more recently gained prominence in the homog-

enization of particulate composites [15]. Within the SPFT, estimates of the HCM’s constitutive

parameters are calculated as successive iterates to the constitutive parameters of a homogenous

comparison medium. The iterates are expressed in terms of correlation functions describing the

spatial distribution of the constituent material particles. In principle, correlation functions of ar-

bitrarily high order can be incorporated.

The SPFT is commonly implemented at the second–order level of approximation wherein the

distribution statistics are stated in terms of a two–point correlation function and its associated cor-

relation length [16]. The correlation length is taken to be large relative to the constituent material

particles, but small relative to the electromagnetic wavelengths. The electromagnetic responses of

constituent material particles within a region of linear dimensions given by the correlation length

are mutually dependent, whereas the electromagnetic responses of constituent material particles

separated by distances much greater than the correlation length are assumed to be independent

[17].

In the following sections, the second–order SPFT is applied to investigate the role of corre-

lation length in predicting whether or not an isotropic dielectric–magnetic HCM supports NPV

2. HOMOGENIZATION

Let us consider the homogenization of two constituent materials described in the previous

section. Both constituent materials are composed of electrically small spherical particles, which

are randomly mixed together. Since materials a and b are assumed to be passive, the principle of

causality — combined with the implicit time–dependence exp(

iωt) — imposes the constraint [18]

The HCM is an isotropic, homogeneous, dielectric–magnetic material. By application of the

SPFT, estimates of its relative permittivity ǫHCM and relative permeability µHCM are provided by

the iterative reﬁnement of the corresponding constitutive parameters of a homogeneous comparison

medium. Furthermore, it transpires that the relative permittivity and relative permeability of the

comparison medium are identical to those yielded by the Bruggeman homogenization formalism

[15, 17] — namely, ǫBr and µBr [7].

At the second–order level of approximation, the SPFT estimates emerge as [15, 17]

3. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Let us now explore how the correlation length L aﬀects the propensity of the chosen type of

HCM to support NPV propagation. We do so by evaluating (6) and (7) for speciﬁc values of ǫa,b,

µa,b, fa and L.

To allow for direct comparison with numerical results based on the Bruggeman homogenization

formalism reported elsewhere [7, 12], let us select the following values: ǫa =

6 + 0.9i, µa =

−

1.5 + 0.2i, ǫb =

1.5 + i, and µb = 2 + 1.2i.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The isotropic dielectric–magnetic HCM arising from a random mixture of two isotropic dielectric–

magnetic materials — neither of which supports NPV propagation itself — supports NPV prop-

agation within certain parameter ranges. This conclusion, which had previously been established

by the Bruggeman [7] and the extended Bruggeman [12] homogenization formalisms, is herein con-

6

ﬁrmed by the more sophisticated SPFT. In contrast to previous studies involving NPV–supporting

metamaterials [9, 10], the SPFT–based HCM supports NPV propagation across a wide range of

volume fraction and the prediction that the HCM supports NPV propagation does not rely upon

resonant behaviour by the constituent material particles.

By increasing the correlation length, the scope for NPV is found to diminish, but not disappear.

In this respect, the eﬀect of increasing the correlation length is similar to the eﬀect of increasing

the size of the constituent material particles [12]. That the correlation length and the particle size

give rise to similar eﬀects has been observed elsewhere, in a diﬀerent context [22].

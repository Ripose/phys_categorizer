Abstract
Based on the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory of soliton, the Gordon-Haus timing jitter induced by
ampliﬁer noise is found to be non-Gaussian distributed. Compared with Gaussian distribution given
by the linearized perturbation theory, both frequency and timing jitter have larger tail probability.
The timing jitter has a larger discrepancy to Gaussian distribution than that of frequency jitter.

The Gordon-Haus timing jitter in ﬁber soliton due
to ampliﬁer noise is usually assumed to be Gaussian
distributed1,2,3 when the ﬁrst-order perturbation the-
ory of soliton4,5,6 is used. Previous works showed that
the non-Gaussian timing jitter is induced by soliton
interactions7,8,9 and regeneration10,11 but not by ampli-
ﬁer noise alone. When the ﬁrst-order perturbation of
soliton is linearized1,3, the Gordon-Haus timing jitter is
indeed Gaussian distributed. However, if the ordinary
diﬀerential equations from the ﬁrst-order perturbation is
not linearized, as shown later, the amplitude, frequency
and timing jitters are all non-Gaussian distributed.

In this letter, the amplitude jitter is found to be non-
central chi-square (χ2) distributed, conﬁrming the previ-
ous simulation results2 and the non-Gaussian statistics11.
Both the frequency and timing jitters are also non-
Gaussian distributed.

From the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory of soliton4,5,6,
with ampliﬁer noise alone, the soliton parameters are
evolved according to the following ordinary (or stochas-
tic) diﬀerential equations:

n is the noise variance and E

where σ2
denotes ex-
pectation. From (4) to (6), the variances depend on
the amplitude of A(ζ) and amplitude jitter transfers to
both frequency and timing jitter.
If the amplitude in
the variances of (4) to (6) is assumed to be constant
A(0) = A0] as a ﬁrst-order approximation, am-
[A(ζ)
plitude, frequency and timing jitters are indeed Gaussian
distributed.

≈

The inclusion of amplitude jitter in (4) to (6) is still
within the equations of the ﬁrst-order soliton perturba-
tion theory4,5,6. The nonlinear ﬁrst-order perturbation
can be interpreted the repeated usage of the linearized
ﬁrst-order perturbation3.

Based on (1) and (4), the stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tion (SDE) of the amplitude jitter is dA = √AdwA
where wA is a Wiener process with autocorrelation of
E
n min(ζ1, ζ2). With an initial value

of A(0) = A0, the amplitude jitter is

The timing jitter equation of (3) has two terms, the
ﬁrst-term of
Ω gives the Gordon-Haus timing jitter in-
creasing with ζ3 and second term of nT (ζ) is just the
projection of ampliﬁer noise into timing jitter1. The ﬁrst
term of Gordon-Haus timing jitter is far more interesting
than the second term. The SDE of dTGH =

respectively. Note that the timing jitter has a variance
increase with ζ31.

From the frequency jitter of (8), the non-Gaussian dis-

tribution is induced by the term of 1

noise and noise interaction. The second-order soliton per-
turbation also includes noise and noise interaction20,21.
However, the equations of (1) to (3) with noise variances
of (4) to (5) are directly from the ﬁrst-order perturbation
of soliton4,5,6. Similarly, the non-Gaussian timing jitter
of (9) is induced by the term of 1

2
also includes noise-noise interaction.

Gordon-Haus timing jitter are the inverse Fourier trans-
forms of the corresponding characteristic functions of
(10) and (11), respectively. Figs. 1 plot the probability
density of frequency and Gordon-Haus timing jitter as

ity density functions are shown for signal-to-noise ratio

In conclusion, based on the ﬁrst-order perturbation
theory of soliton, both frequency and timing jitters are
found to be non-Gaussian distributed. Amplitude, fre-
quency, and timing jitters are all Gaussian distributed if
the equations from perturbation are linearized. Without
linearization, the noise projected into frequency and tim-
ing jitters are modulated by the amplitude jitter, lead-
ing to non-Gaussian distribution. The timing jitter has
larger discrepancy to Gaussian distribution than that of
frequency jitter.

frequency σΩ(ζ) and timing σT (ζ) jitter [see (21)] for
Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively. Because the character-
istic functions of (10) and (11) are even real functions,
the probability density functions are also even functions.
Figs. 1 just plot for the positive frequency and timing
jitter. Comparing the frequency jitter of Fig. 1(a) and
the timing jitter of Fig. 1(b), the frequency jitter has a
distribution more close to the Gaussian distribution than
that of timing jitter.

Figs. 2 plot the tail probabilities corresponding to the
probability density functions of Figs. 1. The tail prob-

From both Figs. 1 and 2, both frequency and tim-
ing jitters have a larger tail probability than that of the
Gaussian distribution. The non-Gaussian distribution
leads to higher error probability than that of Gaussian
distribution.

From both Figs. 1(b) and 2(b), the distribution of
Gordon-Haus timing jitter has a large diﬀerent to Gaus-
sian distribution at the tail. Comparing the generat-
ing function of (15) and the Gaussian approximation
of (20), the non-Gaussian timing jitter distribution is
given by the factor of [fλ(ζ)/fλ(0)]1/2 exp(λ2σ2
nA0β2)
that is obviously non-Gaussian. Comparing the gen-
erating function of (14) and the Gaussian approxima-
tion of (20), the non-Gaussian frequency jitter distribu-
tion is given by two factors: the third and higher-order
and the factor of
powers of tanh(x) = x

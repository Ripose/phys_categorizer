Beams that experience third-harmonic generation (THG) also experience Kerr eﬀects. With
Kerr eﬀects, beams do not take simple Gaussian shapes, but exhibit nonlinear dynamics. These
nonlinear dynamics have an eﬀect on the THG accumulated by focusing and then diverging beams.
We formulate a self-consistent and complete set of nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations for a pair of
coupled beams – a fundamental and its third-harmonic. Numerical simulations show that the Kerr
nonlinearities allow some third-harmonic to propagate to the far-ﬁeld even for zero or negative
phase-mismatch. This is because the nonlinear dynamics break the beams’ reﬂection symmetry
about the focal plane and therefore increases far-ﬁeld THG by changing some of the interference
from destructive to constructive. THG conversion eﬃciencies are computed as functions of several
beam parameters.

INTRODUCTION

We study the dynamics of two-color beams in a nonlinear isotropic medium. We take the initial conditions to
be a one-color beam with Gaussian proﬁle. With a cubic (χ(3)) nonlinearity, which is the lowest order possible
in an isotropic medium, the possible nonlinearities are THG, Kerr, and Raman. Any other nonlinearity requires
either a diﬀerent susceptibility (second-harmonics, high-harmonics), or more than two slowly-varying envelopes (sum
and diﬀerence frequency generation). This is one of the simplest nonlinear optics problems, and is for that reason
important; it has an application to third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy [1].

The usual model of THG takes the fundamental beam to be Gaussian, and (inconsistently, or as an approximation)
has THG as the sole nonlinearity [2, 3]. This model has exact analytic solution in which the third-harmonic (TH)
beam takes a Gaussian proﬁle. For a phase-mismatch that is zero or negative, the energy in the TH peaks at the
focus of the fundamental beam, and, after the focus, destructive interference causes all the TH to be re-absorbed by
the fundamental. The latter is often said to be due to the Guoy shift [3], the phase-shift of π that a Gaussian beam
experiences in going from a far-ﬁeld, through a focus, to a far-ﬁeld. But, in fact, the details show it to depend on
the beam’s phase and shape everywhere along its path. However, the fast (electronic) nonlinear response of optical
materials that yields THG also generates Kerr eﬀects (self- and cross-phase modulation). Therefore, one should
include Kerr and perhaps also Raman eﬀects when modeling THG. These can have quite drastic eﬀects on a beam [4].
Although it was recognized as early as 1973 that Kerr eﬀects could inﬂuence THG [5], and although Kerr, THG, and
dispersion have been examined in studies without transverse spatial dynamics [6, 7], the results of transverse nonlinear
dynamics on THG have not heretofore been studied in quantitative detail.

We have derived a set of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equations for two slowly-varying envelopes, with the
relevant nonlinearities treated rigorously and consistently [8]. Because of the microscopy application, we are interested
in very tightly focused beams and pulses, with large momentum and frequency spreads. The NLS equations are thus
given to all orders in dispersion and diﬀraction; numerical simulations are carried out with a method that is accurate
to all orders relevant for the grid [9, 10, 11]. We express the ﬁeld as a fundamental, Aω(x, t), centered about a carrier
wave at frequency ω0, and a TH, A3ω(x, t), centered about a carrier wave at frequency 3ω0,

In the NLS equations (1), △⊥ ≡ ∂2
y is the transverse Laplacian, n(ω) is the index of refraction at frequency ω,
and β(ω) ≡ n(ω)ω/c is the wavenumber. The ﬁrst summation terms on the right-hand sides (RHS) of Eqs. (1) are
dispersion, the second summation is diﬀraction, the third summation is cross-dispersion/diﬀraction. The nonlinear
polarization includes THG, Kerr, and Raman eﬀects [3, 7, 12]. Self-steepening terms [13, 14], of the form ∂(|A|2A)/∂t
and self-frequency shifting terms of the form ∂|A|
∂t A are contained in the ﬁrst-order time derivatives of the nonlinear
polarizations Pω(x, t) and P3ω(x, t) in Eqs. (1). The NLS equations (1) show that self-steepening terms and self-
frequency shifting terms are just the ﬁrst terms of a family of higher order nonlinear terms.

This breaks up the nonlinear response into an electronic (fast) part and a nuclear (slow) part. It also assumes that
the electronic part of the response may be considered frequency-independent on the scale of the pulse bandwidths;
it does not make this assumption for the nuclear part of the response. For the calculations, we take a more speciﬁc
nonlinear polarization, essentially the standard model of the third-order susceptibility of fused silica [12, 15, 16, 17]
plus a generalization,

Here the THG coeﬃcient is decoupled from the other electronic susceptibilities; this is outside the usual model
for pure fused silica in which the electronic contribution is considered instantaneous and the nuclear contrubution
takes the form arising from a single damped harmonic oscillator, χ(t; t1, t2, t3) = χelec δ(t − t1)δ(t1 − t2)δ(t2 − t3) +
χnucl(t1 − t2)δ(t − t1)δ(t2 − t3), with χelec = n2(1 − fRaman), χnucl(t) = n2fRaman(τ 2
exp(−t/τ2) sin(t/τ1),
n2 = n(ω)c nI
2 = 2.8 × 10−20 m2/W, fRaman = 0.18, τ1 = 12.2 fs, and τ2 = 32.0 fs. If the electronic THG
susceptibility diﬀers from the other electronic susceptibilities, the electronic contribution to the susceptibility is not
instantaneous compared to all scales. Direct experimental measurements of the THG susceptibilities are available
[18, 19, 20]. The more recent measurement of the THG coeﬃcient χTHG [19] is smaller than the electronic contribution
to self-phase modulation [18] χelec by a factor of almost four; older measurements [20] give a THG coeﬃcient smaller
than the electronic part of the self-phase modulation by a factor of about 1.5. In the absense of direct experimental
measurements of all the nonlinear polarization coeﬃcients for doped silica, we use the simplest case χTHG = χelec
in numerical simulations, but discuss how the results scale for diﬀerent values of the THG coeﬃcient. Vector eﬀects
are neglected. Inter-band Raman scattering is negligible at the carrier frequencies because of the fast relative phase
oscillation; but in the pulse simulations, inter-band Raman scattering is possible between the lower frequencies within
the higher frequency band, and the higher frequencies within the lower frequency band.

A numerical NLS propagation scheme may be said to be accurate to all orders of dispersion and diﬀraction if it
is accurate to as many orders as there are grid points. Accuracy up to all available orders requires the index of
refraction over the entire numerically represented frequency range. In the split-step fast Fourier transform scheme,
linear propagation is carried out in momentum space; the algorithm may be made accurate to all orders by putting
the frequency dependent index of refraction directly into the formulas for the propagators [8], i.e.,

Here F and F −1 are Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms in x, y, t, k⊥ =
y is the transverse momentum,
and ω is frequency. The linear dispersion eﬀects are contained in β(ω) = n(ω)ω/c; diﬀraction is contained in k⊥. The
oﬀsets by ω0 and 3ω0 are due to the fact that the ﬁelds are slowly-varying envelopes about carrier waves at those
frequencies; when these appear, ω is the frequency relative to the oﬀset. There is no need to compute the coeﬃcients
for dispersion, diﬀraction, self-steepening, etc., explicitly because they are contained implicitly in the linear dispersion
β(ω). Since we simulate focusing and collapse, during which diﬀractive, dispersive, and nonlinear length scales can
easily change by factors of a hundred or more [12, 14], we allow the propagation step to vary such that it remains an
order of magnitude less that the smallest relevent scale.

q

The eﬀects that we are interested in are larger and clearer when the fundamental and TH are not too far from
being phase-matched, ∆k ≡ 3β(ω0) − β(3ω0) ≈ 0, or n(ω0) ≈ n(3ω0). Optical materials may be doped to obtain
desired properties [12, 21]. We consider silica doped with neodynium to obtain approximate phase-matching between
the fundamental λ = 1.5 µm and TH λ = 0.5 µm. To model the frequency dependent index of refraction, we use the
Sellmeier relation for fused silica [22], but add one additional resonance at λNd = 0.59 µm, which is neodynium’s largest
resonance in the vicinity of our TH. For this, phase-matching is achieved at the Sellmeier coeﬃcient BNd ≈ 0.0138,
which corresponds to a few percent doping of the material. Phase-mismatch is varied by changing the dopant
concentration (in this model, the Sellmeier coeﬃcient BNd). We take the conventional nonlinear coeﬃcients for pure
silica [12], as given above.

We simulated the propagation of both pulses and continuous beams, over a range of light intensities, phase-mismatch
values, and focusing strengths. The eﬀects of the nonlinearity are clearly visible in Fig. 1, which shows the evolution
of beams with varying intensity. For all simulations, we took initial conditions with zero power in the TH, and the
fundamental in the form of a Gaussian with some radial phase factor A1(x, t; z = 0) = A1 exp[−(ic1 + 2 ln 2/W 2
1 )(x2 +
y2)]. The radial phase factor c1 can be related to the wavefront radius of curvature R1 via the magnitude of the
wavevector β(ω) = n(ω)ω/c according to the formula R1 = 0.5β(ω)/c1. Because the fundamental focuses very
intensely, while only a relatively small part of it is converted to TH, we illustrate the peak intensity of the fundamental
beam and the power of the TH beam. In Fig. 1, the input beam has initial width FWHM = 50 µm, a radial phase
factor c1 = 5.0 × 109/m2 that brings the beam to a focus in 0.6 mm, and the material is phase-matched (the reciprocal
of the phase-mismatch is more than an order of magnitude greater than the simulation distance). The fact that the
normalized TH power varies with fundamental input intensity shows that the beams experience nonlinear dynamics,
changing shape as the intensity changes. In Fig. 1, the initial wave front radii of curvature are small and their eﬀect
on the position of the focus overshadow the intensity dependence. One can see that the beams approach the linear
limit at low intensities, as these curves start to almost overlap. Fig. 2 shows the normalized far-ﬁeld TH power as a
function of input power, for the data in Fig. 1 and for another set of runs with weaker focusing.

For a qualitative explanation of these ﬁgures, we ﬁrst contrast our results with the model

in which
in the case with phase-matching, the TH power PTH(z) =
THG is the only nonlinearity [2, 3]. Here,
(3/2)(2π/nc)2(ω/c)4(πW 2
1] reaches a maximum at the focus of the fundamental and
then drops oﬀ as the inverse square of z/z1, where z1 = πW 2
1 /λ0 is the Rayleigh range of the fundamental and the
TH beam, and W1 is the width of the fundamental at its focus. Our simulations show that at high intensities, the
Kerr eﬀect causes the beams to lose reﬂection symmetry about the focal plane. With this asymmetry, THG from the
incoming and outgoing beams does not fully interfere destructively, and allows some TH to propagate to the far-ﬁeld.
The lower-intensity curves in Fig. 1 do not quite drop oﬀ as the inverse square of distance because the numerical
simulations did not start out from minus inﬁnity, but began with merely a large (ﬁnite) beam width. The reﬂection
asymmetry in Fig. 1 is due partly to the nonlinearities and partly to starting with a ﬁnite initial beam width. As long
as the amount of energy in the TH is relatively small, the nonlinear dynamic eﬀects will remain in the fundamental

4

beam, and the TH peak intensities and beam powers may scale up or down by a uniform factor, but will be otherwise
unaﬀected. Clearly, there is signiﬁcant variation with the fundamental input power. Moreover, this variation is quite
diﬀerent for diﬀerent focusing conditions.

In another series of simulations, phase-mismatch is varied. Fig. 3 shows the peak intensity of the fundamental and
the TH beam power with initial FWHM = 50 µm, radial phase-factor c1 = 5.0 × 109/m2, and phase-mismatch from
-12.9 to 51.8 mm−1. Because the TH power ﬁrst increases and then decreases with phase-mismatch, we show the
former range on one plot and the latter on another. Clearly, there is a residual far-ﬁeld TH and its power depends on
phase-mismatch. Fig. 4 shows the far-ﬁeld TH conversion eﬃciency as a function of phase mismatch, for the runs in
Fig. 3 and another set of runs with weaker focusing, c1 = 2.5 × 109/m2. As in the linear model [2], THG by a focusing
beam is maximized around a certain phase-mismatch; but the nonlinear dynamics complicate the results considerably.
In a further series of simulations, the intensity and phase-mismatch were held constant, and the radial phase
factor varied. This mixes up a few physical eﬀects, since initial conditions with small radial phase factors cannot be
considered as starting from the far-ﬁeld. Fig. 5 has extremely small phase-mismatch (∆k = 0.067 mm−1), and radial
phase factors which vary from zero (i.e., starting at a focus) up to c1 = 5.0 × 109/m2. The horizontal axis is on a
log scale to help visually distinguish the superimposed sumulations. The peak fundamental intensity varies, but over
the range studied, the peak TH power is rather insensitive to the wavefront radius of curvature of the fundamental,
but the far-ﬁeld TH power does vary considerably. Fig. 6 shows the far-ﬁeld TH power as a function of radial phase
factor, for the runs in Fig. 5, and also for a series of runs with signiﬁcant positive and negative phase-mismatch. In
increasing (decreasing) the tightness of the focusing, the nonlinear and diﬀraction lengths both decrease (increase);
the complexity of the results for far-ﬁeld THG reﬂect the complexity of the nonlinear dynamics of the beam.

Fig. 7 shows the dependence of the third-harmonic power on the when the THG suseptibility χTHG is varied. The
curve labeled χTHG = χelec corresponds to the same conditions used in Fig. 3 but with ∆k = 0.067 mm−1 (i.e., almost
phase-matched). The third harmonic power scales with |χTHG|2 when the third-harmonic intensity is small since then
the nonlinear dynamics of the fundamental is unaﬀected by TH and the generation of TH ﬁeld is proportional to
χTHG. The values of χTHG used in the calculations shown in Fig. 7 are a factor of 1.0, 1/3.9, and 1/1.5 times the
value used in the previous ﬁgures, where the latter two factors correspond to the measured values of χTHG reported
in Refs. [18, 19, 20]

Numerical simulations showed the dynamics of pulses to diﬀer from those of continuous waves in essentially two
ways. First, the group velocities of the fundamental and TH will, except for special cases, not be the same. A TH
pulse will thus generally walk oﬀ from a fundamental pulse. This tends to reduce destructive interference; it also limits
the eﬀective distance over which the pulses interact. Compared to beams, TH pulses tend to carry oﬀ a larger part of
the fundamental pulse energy. Secondly, the dynamics of pulses (3+1–dimensional) are qualitatively diﬀerent to those
of continuous beams (2+1–dimensional). For strongly focused but not very short pulses, these diﬀerences tend to be
minor. A thorough analysis of focused pulses in this system is quite involved, and will be pursued elsewhere. Thus,
the detailed results for continuous-wave beams apply to pulses for which group-velocity diﬀerences are relatively small
or for pulses that are relatively long.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In a nonlinear medium, intense beams or pulses of ﬁnite diameter which converge to a focus and then diverge may
exhibit nonlinear dynamics that signiﬁcanly aﬀect propagation dynamics. These nonlinear eﬀects break the beam’s
reﬂection symmetry about the focal plane. The greater the intensity, the bigger the diﬀerence between incoming
and outgoing beams. THG with such an input beam or pulse produces TH in the far-ﬁeld when the phase-mismatch
between the fundamental and its third-harmonic is zero or negative (and small). We have quantitatively demonstrated
this for several cases. When phase-mismatch is positive, where some far-ﬁeld TH power is possible in the essentially
linear case, the nonlinear beam dynamics complicate the accumulation of TH power. The non-zero far-ﬁeld THG
for zero or negative phase-mismatch – a qualitatively new eﬀect for homogeneous media – is aﬀected by, and thus
contains information about the medium in the region of the beam focus. For an inhomogeneous medium, and for
THG microscopy, these eﬀects should be understood, either to be utilized or better avoided.

smaller radial phase factor, that brings the beam to a focus in about 1.2 mm.

with identical power, width, and radial phase factor, while the phase-mismatch goes from -12.9 to 51.8 mm−1

and another with smaller radial phase factor, that brings the beam to a focus in about 1.2 mm. Initial intensities are
held constant.

Fig. 5. Peak intensity of the fundamental beam, and power of the third-harmonic versus propagation distance for
diﬀerent fundamental radial curvatures. The curves show beams with phase-matching and initially identical power
and width; the initial radial phase factors go from zero (starting at a focus) up to 5.0 × 109/m2, by increments of
0.5 × 109/m2 (the curves here correspond to circled points in the appropriate curve in Fig. 6).

The plane-wave dynamics of 3ω → 2ω, ω subharmonic optical parametric oscillators containing
a second harmonic generator of the idler-wave ω is analyzed analytically by using the meanﬁeld
approximation and numerically by taking into account the ﬁeld propagation inside the media. The
resonant χ(2)(−3ω; 2ω, ω) : χ(2)(−2ω; ω, ω) cascaded second-order nonlinearities induce a mutual
injection-locking of the signal and idler waves that leads to coherent self phase-locking of the pump
and subharmonic waves, freezing the phase diﬀusion noise.
In case of signal-and-idler resonant
devices, largely detuned sub-threshold states occur due to a subcritical bifurcation, broadening out
the self-locking frequency range to a few cavity linewidths.

I. INTRODUCTION

The synthesis of phase-coherent (sub)harmonic optical radiation (ω, 2ω, ..., N ω) is useful in high precision optical
measurements, such as optical frequency metrology [1], [2]. In frequency metrology, a phase-coherent optical by-N
divider allows to reduce the absolute measurement of an optical frequency N ω (e.g, couting cycles in the hundreds of
THz range) to the measurement of a smaller frequency interval ∆ = ω by use of a femtosecond laser comb generator
whose radio-frequency intermode spacing is phase-locked to a primary microwave clock [3]. The generation of a comb
of phase-locked harmonic radiation can also be the starting basis for the generation of attosecond pulse train by Fourier
synthesis [4], [5], [6]. Indeed, the superposition (Fourier synthesis [7], [8]) of a comb of N equal amplitude optical
harmonic ﬁelds with a controllable relative phase relationship can lead to a temporal train of ultra-short pulses with
a sub-optical cycle duration (τ ∼ 2π/N ω) and a repetition rate equal to the fundamental harmonic ω. Phase-locked
optical harmonic generators are often based on many lasers linked via nonlinear upconversion parametric processes
[1], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Phase coherence among the harmonic waves is usually achieved by use of complex electronic
phase-locking loops. The high conversion eﬃciencies of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) combined with the
engineering ﬂexibility oﬀered by periodically poled (PP) nonlinear materials may allow a compact implementation of
such optical subharmonic generators or attosecond pulse generator.

The study of OPOs as by-N dividers (N = 2, 3, 4) of a pump frequency νp is motivated by their capacity to
perform the phase-coherent division of a pump photon into two highly phase-correlated subharmonic photons. In
N 2) compared
precision measurement setups, subharmonic generation leads to a subsequent phase noise reduction (
N 2). Graham and Haken have ﬁrst demonstrated that the phase sum ϕ1 + ϕ2 of the
to harmonic generation (
idler and signal waves from an OPO follows adiabatically the phase noise ϕp of the pump laser, while their phase
ϕ1 undergoes a phase diﬀusion process stemming from the interaction of both modes with the vacuum
diﬀerence ϕ2 −
ﬂuctuations [13]. To act as pertinent phase-coherent dividers, the idler and signal waves have thus to be phase-locked,
ϕ1 to copy the phase of an external RF oscillator
for instance by use of an electronic servo control that forces ϕ2 −
referenced to a primary clock. Such an electronic servo technique has been implemented to develop phase-coherent
divide-by-2 (2:1) [14], and divide-by-3 (3:1) OPOs for high resolution optical metrology [15], [16] with corresponding
residual phase diﬀerence variance well below 1 rad2.

Electronic phase-locking loops are however subject to limited response time bandwidth and require fast OPO cavity
length actuators. As an alternative, all-optical self phase-locking (SPL) methods are currently being investigated [17],

1

[18] to by-pass the bandwidth limitation of electronic servos and simplify the implementation of phase-locked dividers.
These methods are based on the self injection-locking of the subharmonic waves, similarly to the injection locking
process of a slave laser oscillator by a master laser which possesses a better spectral purity and frequency stability [7],
[19]. In injection-locked systems, the phase of the slave oscillator, φ(t) = ωt + ϕ(t), is a perfect copy of the phase of
the injecting master oscillator. Phase locking can occur only when the two frequencies are close enough, e.g. within a
Pm/Ps of the injecting
certain locking range ∆ωlock =
master power to the slave power. It is thus expected that the self-locking range in an OPO divider should depend
on whether the OPO is conﬁgured as a doubly-resonant (DRO), a triply-resonant (TRO) or a pump-enhanced singly
resonant oscillator (PRSRO). Strong self injection-locking regime occurs only when the signal and idler waves are
simultaneously resonant.

For divide-by-2 OPOs based on a type-I nonlinear process (the signal and idler are identically polarized), self-
injection locking occurs naturally when the OPO is tuned close enough to the frequency-degeneracy [20]. Recently a
type-II self phase-locked 2:1 DRO was demonstrated, in which a small mixing of the two orthogonally polarized signal
and idler waves, performed by an intracavity wave plate, induces the injection locking [17]. In both cases the evidence
of self phase locking was provided by the high level of phase-coherence between the frequency degenerate signal and
idler waves. Following the experiment in ref [17], the theory of linearly coupled type-II 2:1 SPL-DROs has been
reported [21]. In the case of 3:1 OPO dividers, obviously such a linear coupling cannot be implemented, and one must
use a nonlinear coupling via χ(2)(
2ω; ω, ω) cascading processes (for instance by introducing inside
the OPO cavity a second nonlinear material phase-matched for the SHG of the idler wave). The ﬁrst implementation
of such a self phase-locked (SPL) OPO was recently reported, and used a dual-grating periodically poled lithium
niobate chip carrying the OPO and SHG sections in a pump-resonant idler-resonant conﬁguration (PRSRO) [18]. An
extremely small locking range of ∼500 kHz, corresponding to a fraction of the idler cavity linewidth, was reported
due to the weak (non resonant) doubled idler power. A diﬀerent situation should occur when both the signal and
idler waves are resonant, as in a DRO or a TRO. Because of the enhanced energy ﬂow exchange between the 2ω and
ω modes, the dynamics of such a self-phase locked OPO (SPL-OPO) is expected to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from that of a
conventional OPO. Strictly speaking the 3:1 SPL-DRO or TRO can be regarded as a degenerate sub/second harmonic
generator (2ω ⇆ ω +ω) internally pumped by the signal wave of a non-degenerate OPO (3ω ⇆ 2ω +ω). While theories
of OPO devices containing additional up or down conversion of the signal and idler waves have been investigated in
the past with the aim of generating new frequencies [22], [23], [24], [25], or revealing the quantum noise signature of
competing χ(2) nonlinearities [26], [27] such a subharmonically resonant conﬁguration of competing nonlinearities in
OPOs has never been theoretically investigated in detail. A 3:1 DRO-SHG rough rate equation analysis based on
photon ﬂux conservation, but neglecting the role of cavity detunings and ﬁeld phase coherence, was previously given
by Zhang et al [28] with the conclusion that self-phase locking should manifest through an imbalance of the signal and
idler intensities at exact 3:1 division. Actually our in-depth analysis shows that such an imbalance holds only for zero
detunings: When the nonlinear phase shift due to cascading is compensated by a non-zero optimal cavity detuning,
one can obtain the same output intensities as in a conventional DRO.

In this paper, we provide a detailed plane-wave description of the dynamics of divide-by-3 SPL-OPOs that encom-
passes all the three cavity conﬁgurations (only the main results are summarized in the conclusion for the PRSRO,
which will be detailed elsewhere). The dynamics of the nonlinearly coupled OPO is shown to diﬀer substancially from
the linear coupling case of a type-II 2:1 SPL-DRO [21]. In particular, the nonlinear coupling gives rise to a subcrital
bifurcation for any non-zero cavity detuning while conventional OPOs undergo subcritical bifurcations only for the
case of largely pump-detuned TROs [29], [30]. As a consequence of the nonlinear phase shifts due to the cascading
processes, SPL-DROs or TROs will be shown to display large-intensity stable stationary states that would correspond
to non-lasing detuning domains in conventional OPOs, extending thus the phase-locking detuning range up to a few
cavity linewidths.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II we describe the basic plane-wave ring cavity model leading to the
meanﬁeld solutions that will be compared with the full propagation solutions. In section III, we ﬁrst treat in detail
the DRO conﬁguration case. We then extend the theory to the case of a TRO in section IV. Main results on the
PRSRO conﬁgurations will be also summarized in the conclusion. Section V discusses the practical implementation
of such SPL-OPOs on the basis of the theoretical ﬁndings and section VI concludes with some prospective studies
aroused by this ﬁrst theoretical approach.

II. BASIC MODEL AND EXACT NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS

The OPO-SHG device described in the paper is schematically sketched in Fig.1. We consider a ring cavity containing
the cascaded OPO and SHG nonlinear media, each of length L1 and L2 respectively and assume that the pump, signal
and idler waves satisfy already the 3:2:1 frequency ratios. Though the drawing depicts the case of a dual-grating PP
material, phase-matched for an (eee) interaction, the model is valid also for any separate birefringent material sections,
or a single material phase-matched for both interactions. In the case of birefringent phase-matching however, the
OPO should be of type-II kind (e.g. e
e),

The solutions at the SHG crystal exit can be limited to few terms of the Mac-Laurin ﬁeld expansion serie at the cell
entrance, because of the smallness of the parametric gain coeﬃcients. We shall refer to ML1 approximation, keeping
only the lowest-order perturbative terms, i.e. quadratic terms in powers of the ﬁeld amplitudes. At the exit of the
SHG crystal, the ML1 axpproximation provides the solutions for the signal and idler amplitudes as functions of their

B. Boundary conditions

The reduced Maxwell equations have to be completed by the boundary conditions for the three waves at the entrance
of the OPO crystal to derive the cavity equations. The ﬁeld Aj (t + τ, 0) at location ”0” and at a time t + τ , where
τ = Λ/c is the cavity roundtrip time (Λ is the total cavity optical path), is the ﬁeld Aj(t, L1 + L2) at point ”2”of
Fig.1, which propagates freely after bounces at the totally reﬂecting (R = 1) and output coupling (rj , tj) mirrors and
eventually summed with an input ﬁeld, as it is the case for the pump ﬁeld. We deﬁne by rj (tj) the overall mirror
amplitude reﬂectivities (transmissivities), such that r2

in . Each ∆j is the usual cavity detuning
between the frequency of the waves and the corresponding cold cavity frequency, scaled to the HWHM cavity resonance
width ( Only nearly resonant waves will be considered, ∆j << 2π).

The set of equations (9) and (11) forms a mapping of the ﬁeld amplitudes at location ”0”, from which meanﬁeld

equations may be derived.

The meanﬁeld model was originally derived from a similar set of equations for a two-level cell ring cavity device when
the atomic dephasing time is much greater than the round-trip time τ , but much smaller than the photon lifetime τ /κ
[31]. For an OPO, the situation is somewhat diﬀerent because the response of the crystal is assumed to be instantaneous
(see Eqs. 5). Nevertheless, meanﬁeld equations can be also derived from the ML1 equations (9) and the boundary
conditions (11) if the ﬁeld amplitudes are slowly varying during a round-trip time, i.e. τ (dAj /dt) << Aj(t) [32], [33].

The solutions X+ and X− are represented by the lines a and a’, respectively, in Fig. 2 that displays a subcritical
bifurcation: Indeed, only the stationary solution X+ is stable ( solid line a ) and extends from the saddle-node intensity
I0 to the Hopf bifurcation intensity IH , above which the solution is periodic (dashed portion) . The stationary solution
X− is marginally unstable (dashed line a’), whatever the input intensity might be [See Appendix].

Let us notice that the conventional DRO detuning condition, ∆= ∆1/κ1 = ∆2/κ2 does no longer necessarily hold
and hence the SPL-DRO can oscillate with a wider detuning range. This result is similar to the result of a 2:1
degenerate SPL-DRO, in the case of a linear coupling. However, this latter case does not display any subcriticality:
The linear coupling gives rise instead to two self phase-locked states corresponding to two distinct thresholds, for a
given pumping rate [21].

The time evolution of the ﬁeld amplitudes is obtained by solving the propagation equations (5-6) with the boundary

by numerical integration of Eqs. (5-6) using of a fourth-order Runge Kutta algorithm, until convergence is achieved.
In most of the calculations, the cavity loss coeﬃcients are taken constant and equal, κ1,2 = 0.005, and the SHG phase
mismatch ξ = ∆kL2/2 = 0, unless otherwise stated. The input amplitude, the detunings and the coupling constant
are varied.

the stability of the subthreshold states against external perturbations that tend to modulate the detuning parameter

We can deﬁne a self-locking domain in the (∆1, ∆2) plane over which the DRO is self phase-locked with a well-deﬁned
phase relationship. Contour plots of the numerical solutions for the idler I1, the signal I2, the total subharmonic
intensity I1 + I2 and the phase diﬀerence η are shown in Figs 5 for
= 0.2 and for a given pumping rate N =
Ip/κ1κ2 = 4 . The subharmonic intensities are scaled to the conventional zero-detuning DRO values as deduced from
Eqs.(12c), I DRO
1,2 = 2κ2,1. These contour plots are obtained by adiabatical following of the stationary solutions in
order to reveal the 2D subthreshold domain. The granular small regions adjacent to the ∆1 = 0 axis correspond to a
time-dependent regime. The I1 and I2 intensity distributions in Figs 5a-5b display oﬀ-diagonal maxima that are larger
than the conventional DRO signal and idler outputs ( I1,2/I DRO
1,2 = 1.6). Note also that the exact intensities I1 and
I2 are not invariant with respect to the product ∆1∆2, diﬀerently from the predicted meanﬁeld intensities (16) but
they satisfy the relation (19). The ﬁgure (5c) shows that the maximum total intensity, slightly larger (I1 + I2 = 2.2 )
than the conventional DRO total intensity, I1 + I2 = 2, occurs in the subthreshold domain close to the saddle-node
bifurcation (see diagonal line d in Fig.3). These curves show that the relative phase control of the subharmonics can
be achieved via the control of the relative output intensities, provided that an independent control of both cavity
detunings is implemented (see section V).

Phase-locking

The numerical phase η related to the diﬀerence between the signal and idler phases agrees extremely well with the
mean-ﬁeld prediction in Eqs. (20b),( 22b) or (23),(24b) for any values of the detuning and cavity loss parameter, but
the numerical phase µ related to the sum of the signal and idler phases is found to depart signiﬁcantly from the mean-
ﬁeld value (20a) when ∆1,2/κ1,2 % 1. We have checked numerically the self phase-locking eﬀect of the signal-idler
output, by varing randomly the initial phase of the signal and idler noise. This general result is illustrated in Fig.6,
= 0, as
for ∆1/κ1 = ∆2/κ2 where the phase diﬀerence η follows randomly the initial values (blank circles), when
expected for a conventional DRO. However, yet for a vanishingly small value S = 0.001, the phase diﬀerence η locks
to 0 or π (mod kπ) for ξ = 0 and the sum phase locks to a constant value determined only by the pumping rate.

idler amplitudes of Fig.3 but induces a slight imbalance of the signal and idler intensity ratio compared to the ratio
(19) and slightly reduces the self-locking range. The relation µ = 0 (mod π) is still valid and η locks to ξ. In some
undesirable operating conditions, for instance, when the system approaches a Hopf bifurcation for a given pumping
rate and detuning set (see Fig.2 for S = 0.2, ξ = 0), a small amount of phase mismatch produces a shift of the periodic
oscillation threshold towards higher pump rate. Diﬀerently, for ∆= 0 and the same other parameters as for curve (c)

From the simulations carried out, we conclude that a moderate SHG phase-mismatch does not change signiﬁcantly

the main bifurcation dynamics studied up to this point, except for the ∆1,2 = 0 case.

Finally let us point out that the SPL-DRO solutions expanded up to the second-order in Eq. (9) (ML2 approxima-
tion) agree very well with the exact solutions in almost the whole range of the pump intensity and detunings below
the Hopf bifurcation threshold, except for the singular case ∆1,2 = 0 corresponding to the transition from subcriti-
cality to supercriticality, where it fails to converge. Only the propagation model can solve this case, which requires a
double-precision computation due to the slow convergence associated to a critical slowing-down phenomenon.

In pump-detuned conventional TROs, subcriticality occurs only when the condition ∆p∆> 1 holds [29], [30]. The
experimental observation of this subcriticality requires a high pumping level because of the pump detuning dependence
in Eq.(28) [35] . It is interesting to study how the subcriticality originating from the nonlinear OPO/SHG cascading
would aﬀect the intrinsic detuned TRO bistability curve. In Fig.9 we have plotted the numerically computed idler

In summary, the only improvement due to a moderate pump resonance is the stabilization eﬀect respective to the

onset of temporal dynamics. The extended self-phase locking range is paid back with lower output intensities.

V. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF SPL-OPOS

In order to avoid spurious cavity loss, the use of a dual-grating quasi-phase matched periodically poled crystal
is particularly well suited to the implementation of SPL-OPOs. However, the grating period should be accurately
designed so as to phase-matched simultaneously both interactions for the same chip temperature, even though the
theoretical analysis predicts a minor inﬂuence of SHG phase mismatch.

From an experimental point of view, it is desirable to implement 3:1 SPL-OPOs using the least constraining OPO
conﬁguration. Diagnosis methods to check the high phase coherence between the subharmonics under SPL have to be
implemented. In the frequency domain, this can be achieved by monitoring the beatnote between the signal wave and
the externally frequency-doubled idler wave (or between the summed subharmonics and the pump). Because under
SPL operation these two waves are frequency degenerate, the output signal wave must be preliminary frequency-
shifted by a suitable RF frequency ωRF using, e.g., an acousto-optic modulator. When the OPO operates within the
locking range, the beatnote frequency should be ﬁxed to ωRF and its power spectral density should approach a Dirac
function. Another equivalent method to check the phase coherence is to perform an interferometric fringe pattern
measurement by overlapping the two beams on a slow detector [17]. In the following, other indirect methods, based
on the theoretical analysis will be outlined.

As a starting point of the analysis, we have assumed perfect 3:2:1 frequency ratios for the pump, signal and idler
waves. In practical devices, such a situation will be unlikely met at once. The major diﬃculty will come from the
ﬁne (continuous) tuning of the signal and idler frequencies close enough to the 2:1 degeneracy, in order to fall within
the capture range of the self-phase locking. For a ﬁxed pump frequency, such a ﬁne tuning is usually performed
via the temperature or angle tuning of the phase-matching. Singly resonant devices (PRSROs) oﬀer an easy and
relaxed mode-hop free frequency tuning because only one subhamonic wave is resonant, especially in a dual-arm
cavity conﬁguration to control independently the pump and signal resonances [36]. However from our analysis of the
SPL-PRSRO with a resonant signal wave, which also displays subcriticality, extremely small self-locking ranges are
predicted due to the weak coupling between the injecting frequency-doubled idler and the resonant signal. While in
a conventional PRSRO the signal ﬁeld is constrained to oscillate with a nil cavity detuning, the nonlinear coupling
is found to allow oscillation over a small detuning range not exceeding the cavity linewidth. The increase of the
locking range versus the coupling parameter (e.g. the SHG crystal length) is only moderate, even with
= 1 (which
would correspond to a SHG crystal ∼ 1.5 times longer than the OPO crystal supposing that both OPO and SHG
interactions have the same nonlinearity magnitude) . Due to this limited capture range, experimentally conﬁrmed in
ref [18], 3:1 SPL-PRSROs would probably require an additional electronic servo on the cavity length to operate as a
stable divider device. A convenient criterion for the assessment of SPL in PRSROs would be the slight enhancement

χ
|

|

of the signal intensity when the nonlinear coupling is switched on, compared to the slight decrease predicted for the
SPL-DRO (Fig.3 ). A possible way to realize such a switching is to have an OPO-only grating section patterned
beside the OPO/SHG dual-grating section on the periodically-poled wafer.

|

|

χ

From our theoretical study, the widest SPL range (a few cavity linewidths) is obtained with the doubly resonant
conﬁguration (SPL-DRO) due to the strong self-injection regime, with eventually a weak pump resonance (SPL-TRO)
to stabilize the device. Even though the amount of nonlinear coupling required can be extremely small (
= 0.01 )
- and such low level doubled idler can even be spontaneously generated via non-phase matched or higher-order quasi-
phase matching in PP single-grating nonlinear OPO crystals - a coupling strength corresponding to
0.2 will
ensure a robust self-phase locking of the subharmonic wave. Preliminary single mode-pair operation of DRO/TROs
usually require an intensity sidelock servo to control the stability of the cavity length. This sidelock servo compares
the output signal (or idler) intensity to a stable electronic voltage reference which sets the operating (usually non-zero)
signal and idler cavity detuning values. When a linear cavity is used, the signal and idler (plus eventually the pump)
detunings cannot be independently controlled via the cavity length. It is then probable that the oscillating mode pair
will have equal normalized detunings (condition (12a)) that satisfy the minimum threshold. Under sidelock servo the
transition from conventional to SPL states is accompanied necessarily by a detuning transition (see Fig.3). It is then
important to set the sidelock reference voltage as close as to the maximum fringe intensity in order that the new
detuning value does not exceed the allowed subthreshold range. In the case of a well resolved DRO mode pair cluster,
the observation of these subthreshold states, and the associated broadened mode pair fringe, should be made possible
via adiabatic cavity length tuning. Such an observation would be an indirect diagnosis of SPL. But it is necessary to
have an independent control of the signal and idler detunings to explore the full allowed range of (∆1, ∆2) detunings
depicted in Figs.5 and 10. A dual-cavity DRO/TRO design would then be appropriate. The control of these detunings
allows the control of the relative phase between the pump, signal and idler. The output subharmonic intensity ratio
I1/I2 (see Eq.19) can be used as an error signal for the relative phase control.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have theoretically demonstrated that resonant χ(2) : χ(2) nonlinear cascaded OPO/SHG processes induce a self
injection-locking between the subharmonic waves of an OPO leading to the self-phase locking of the three interacting
waves, unlike in a conventional OPO for which the absolute phases of the signal and idler are undetermined. The
theoretical treatment encompasses the meanﬁeld model as well as a full propagation model. The doubly and triply
resonant oscillator conﬁgurations lead to the widest self phase-locking ranges. The main conclusions are: a) the
minimum threshold of oscillation of these devices are identical to the conventional devices; b) the nonlinear cascading
leads to a subcritical behaviour, even in the case of a DRO or a PR-SRO, and can lead to the occurrence of self-pulsing
instabilitities. This subcriticality is diﬀerent from the standard subcriticality reported in pump detuned conventional
TROs. The nonlinear coupling removes the detuning constraints of conventional systems, allowing for a potentially
accurate control of the relative phase between the subharmonic waves. The range of allowable detunings over which
the ﬁeld phases are locked depends on the magnitude of the nonlinear coupling and on the self-injection regime.
While this range is smaller than the cavity linewidth for PRSROs (weak injection regime), it spans over several
cavity linewidths under strong injection-locking regime obtained in signal/idler resonant devices (DRO/TROs). The
SPL-DRO/TRO give rise to a richer dynamics than the singly resonant PRSRO for which no occurence of a Hopf
bifurcation is found in the whole range of the system parameters. It is thus interesting to extend the theoretical
model by including diﬀraction eﬀects in order to investigate the possible occurrence of new spatio-temporal dynamics,
[33], [37]. These self-phase locked OPOs will be useful tools for applications requiring a high degree of optical phase
coherence between optical harmonic waves, such as precision optical measurements in the mid-IR or Fourier synthesis
of ultra-short optical pulses.

The model developed can be easily extended to the study of divide-by-4 SPL-OPOs based on the cascading
OPO/OPO processes 4ω ⇄ 2ω ⇄ ω which has the potential to generate up to 8 phase-locked harmonic waves
by additional up-conversion processes. Such a strong nonlinearly coupled system can be viewed as a secondary degen-
erate OPO (DOPO) embedded in a primary DOPO. Our future work will be directed to the theoretical investigation
of the stability of 4:1 OPO dividers. A classical signature of the system, derived from the meanﬁeld analysis, is the
clamping of the secondary pump 2ω to the threshold power for the fundamental oscillation.

The present study of 3:1 OPO dividers, which makes the simplest assumption of exact 3:2:1 frequency ratios, arouses
another interrogation. An interesting situation not considered regards the behaviour of the nearly 3:1 OPO/SHG
system when the frequency ratios slightly departs from the perfect 3:2:1 division ratio by a radio-frequency quantity
δ << ω, e.g. when 3ω
δ, ω + δ. The frequency diﬀerence beween the signal wave and the doubled idler is

phase matching), a multitude of self-phase locked mode pairs equally spaced by 3δ may potentially oscillate, provided
that the pumping level is suﬃciently high. Such a complex system opens the prospect of building a mode-locked,
dual-band OPO frequency comb generator using cascaded second-order nonlinearities as the passive mode-locking
mechanism. In the time domain, the output of such a system would consist of a train of short optical pulses with
a repetion rate set by the F SRs intermode spacing, provided that the relative phase between adjacent mode pairs
is preserved and group velocity dispersion is compensated. We note that a similar cw-DRO running near frequency
degeneracy with thousands of mode pairs actively locked by an intracavity electro-optic phase modulator has been
recently reported, with a striking passive output stability feature compared to a conventional quasi-degenerate single-
mode pair DRO [38].

The roots for Λ and consequently the eigenvalues λ have been calculated for various detunings ∆1,2 as a function of
the input amplitude Ain for the trivial solutions A1,2 = 0 and the non trivial solutions (A1,2)± deduced from Eqs.(16)
and (20).

The trivial solution is veriﬁed to be stable for any input pump intensity below Ith(Eq.18).
On the other hand the solution X− is found to be unstable with respect to any constant perturbation for any
detuning and input pump intensity: Indeed, in this case, Eq.( A8) has a root Λ = 0,i.e, λ = 0, because the constant
coeﬃcient Φ0 is identically nil, when replacing X− by its expression (16).

Diﬀerently, the upper branch displays two sets of complex conjugate eigenvalues, (σ1,2 ±

iβ1,2) with negative real
parts for a range of the input pump intensity, lying from I0 to IH where the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation
(σ1 = 0). For Ip > IH , the signal and idler intensities oscillate with time at angular frequency β1. Therefore the
upper branch is stable for I0<Ip < IH .

The Hopf bifurcation threshold intensity IH may be either smaller or larger than the threshold intensity Ith,
depending on detunings ∆1 and ∆2. Let us introduce the parameter µH that measures the departure between the
threshold for lasing Ith and the Hopf bifurcation threshold as

−
The variation of µH is presented in Fig. 11 as a function ∆1 = ∆ either with ∆1 = ∆2 in curve (a) or ∆1 = 1

µH = (Ith

IH )/Ith

in curve (b).

For ∆1 = ∆2, the Hofp bifurcation (σ1 = 0, σ2 < 0) occurs above threshold only for ∆ . κ. Therefore lasing
stationary solutions can be reached from rest only for detunings smaller than the cavity loss coeﬃcient. Otherwise,
lasing at larger detunings can be reached, when increasing adiabatically the detunings from values smaller than κ. In
the other case, ∆1 = 1
2 ∆2, µH is positive for any ∆1 . 5κ. For higher detuning, σ2 reaches zero at an input intensity
much smaller than the value at which σ1 = 0 crosses zero. This causes an abrupt decrease of IH , so that µH suddenly
becomes negative for ∆1 > 5κ, as shown in the curve (b) of Fig. 11.

Finally, the angular frequency βH at the Hopf bifurcation threshold, not reported here, is found to vary propor-

tionally to the detuning.

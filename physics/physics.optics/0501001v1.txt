Abstract. The diﬀraction of electromagnetic plane waves by a rectangular grating formed

by discrete steps in the interface of a homogeneous, isotropic, linear, negative phase–

velocity (negative index) material with free space is studied using the semi–analytic C

method. When a nonspecular diﬀracted order is of the propagating type, coupling to that

order is signiﬁcantly larger for a negative index material than for conventional material.

The computed coupling strengths reported here are in agreement with recent experiments,

and illustrate the role of evanescent ﬁelds localized at the grating interface in producing

this enhanced coupling.

The study of electromagnetic ﬁelds received a major boost in 2001 with the experimental

conﬁrmation of negative refraction by dielectric–magnetic materials with negative real

permittivity and negative real permeability [1]. When considered as linear, isotropic and

homogeneous, these materials possess a complex–valued refractive index whose real part

is negative, and are therefore often called negative index (NI) materials. Alternatively,

these materials can be referred to as negative phase–velocity (NPV) materials, as the phase

velocity and the time–averaged Poynting vectors therein are antiparallel. Other names are

also in circulation; but, regardless of the name used, the common observable phenomenon

is negative refraction [2, 3, 4].

All experimental realizations of NPV materials thus far are as periodically patterned

composite materials. The unit cell comprises various arrangements of conducting ﬁlaments

in order to realize both dielectric and magnetic response properties in the same frequency

range. For such a material to be considered as eﬀectively homogeneous, the unit cell must

be electrically small — i.e., it must be considerably smaller than the free–space wavelength

as well as the wavelength in the material [5]. In the wedge sample used by Shelby et al.

[1], the unit cell size was about one–sixth of the free–space wavelength. The ﬁnite size of

the unit cell meant that one of the two exposed surfaces of the sample was not planar, but

rather formed a rectangular grating [6]. Because of this grating, the specular (or zeroth–

order) reﬂected/refracted plane wave could be accompanied by nonspecular (higher–order)

diﬀracted plane waves [6].

Recently, using Ansoft’s HFSS package, an electromagnetics equation solver based on

the ﬁnite–element method, Smith et al. [7] examined the plane–wave response of a wedge

having the same properties as that used by Shelby et al.

[1]. One of the two exposed

surfaces was set up as a shallow rectangular grating. The simulation revealed not only

a zeroth–order transmitted plane wave but also, unexpectedly, a strong ﬁrst–order trans-

mitted plane wave. The latter was much stronger for a NPV wedge than for a wedge with

identical dimensions but made of a positive phase–velocity (PPV) material. Although

2

higher–order refracted plane waves were not experimentally observed by Shelby et al. [1],

the ﬁrst–order was deﬁnitively present in later experiments [4, 7].

While full–wave simulations conﬁrm the phenomenon of enhanced diﬀraction at the

NPV grating, the numerical results are not of use in determining the physical origin of the

eﬀect. An alternative approach is furnished by mathematical treatments of diﬀraction by

gratings based on analytic ﬁeld expansions. These treatments have continued to develop

over the last hundred years, and have now acquired a considerable degree of sophistication.

We apply one of these methods here, the so–called C method, both to independently verify

the simulation results obtained by the ﬁnite–element method and to provide further insight

as to the underlying mechanism [7]. The C method, originally developed for dielectric

gratings [8], was modiﬁed to handle dielectric–magnetic gratings [9].

In a rectangular coordinate system (x, y, z), we consider the periodically corrugated

boundary y = g(x) = g(x + d) between vacuum and a homogeneous, isotropic, dielectric–

magnetic material, with d being the corrugation period, as shown in Figure 1. The region

y > g(x) is vacuous, whereas the medium occupying the region y < g(x) is characterized

by complex–valued scalars ǫ2 = ǫ2R + iǫ2I and µ2 = µ2R + iµ2I , such that ǫ2I ≥ 0 and

µ2I ≥ 0. The refracting medium is assumed to be eﬀectively homogeneous at the angular

frequency of interest. A linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave is incident on this

boundary from the region y > g(x) at an angle θ0, (|θ0| < π/2), with respect to the y axis.

Let the function f (x, y) represent the z–directed component of the total electric ﬁeld

for the s–polarization case, and the z–directed component of the total magnetic ﬁeld for

the p–polarization case [10]. Outside the corrugations, f (x, y) is rigorously represented by

The grating of Shelby et al. [1] has a rectangular proﬁle, shown in Figure 1, with the long

and the short sides in the ratio 3 : 1 and period d = 15.81 mm. To simulate this proﬁle for

4

the C method, g(x) was replaced by the truncated Fourier sum

which was found adequate to represent the grating proﬁle.

In Figure 2, we show the diﬀraction eﬃciencies obtained as functions of θ0 at a frequency

of 11.75 GHz, the highest frequency used by Smith et al.

[7], which corresponds to

ωd/c = 2π/1.58. The refracting medium is of either the the NPV (ǫ2 = −5 + i0.01, µ2 =

−1 + i0.01) or the PPV (ǫ2 = 5 + i0.01, µ2 = 1 + i0.01) type. Calculations were made for

both the s– and the p–polarization incidence conditions. As conﬁrmed by perturbation
analysis [12], in this case the transformation {ǫ → −ǫ∗, µ → −µ∗} does not greatly aﬀect

eρ
0 (Fig. 2a), except at low |θ0|. In contrast, Figs. 2b and 2c show that the nonspecular
reﬂection eﬃciencies eρ

±1, are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the type of the refracting medium.

In particular, the interplay between the polarization state and the angle of incidence

leads to (i) very little diﬀerence for the PPV grating between the two polarizations; (ii)

considerable diﬀerence for the NPV grating between the two polarizations, and (iii) a shift

of the diﬀerence between PPV and NPV gratings from one polarization to the other as the

sign of the angle of incidence changes. As the refracting medium is dissipative, diﬀraction

eﬃciencies for the refracted orders cannot be deﬁned.

To study refraction eﬃciencies explicitly, we made the refracting material nondissipative

(ǫ2 = ±5, µ2 = ±1), while the other parameters were kept the same. The higher–order

reﬂection eﬃciency curves display the same qualitatitive behaviors as in Figure 2, and are

therefore not shown in Figure 3. All refraction eﬃciencies are greatly aﬀected by the type

of the refracting medium, as becomes clear from Figs. 3a–c. In particular, the coupling

of power into the n = ±1 refracted orders (Figs. 3b and c) for the NPV grating is much

larger than for a PPV grating, a fact that again is in agreement with the results of Smith

et al. [7].

A similar conclusion is drawn from Figure 4, for which the eﬃciency curves were com-

puted at a frequency of 9.0 GHz (the smallest frequency used by Smith et al.

[7]), the

5

other parameters being the same as in Figure 3. Whereas the zeroth–order (Fig. 4a, the

only propagating order reﬂected at this frequency) reﬂection eﬃciency is much less af-

fected by the type of the refracting medium than in our previous examples, the refraction

eﬃciencies depend strongly on the refracting medium being of the PPV or the NPV type.

The increased coupling into higher–order diﬀracted plane waves represents an important

distinction between the behaviors of PPV and NPV materials, and conﬁrms that surface

periodicity plays a much more signiﬁcant role in the latter [7]. The physical origin of

the enhanced higher–order reﬂection eﬃciencies for the NPV grating can be understood

in an approximate manner by examining the reﬂection eﬃciencies for shallow gratings.

In general, a grating couples the specular coeﬃcients (ρ0 and τ0) with all nonspecular
coeﬃcients (ρn and τn, |n| > 0) [6], thereby coupling eρ

n, |n| > 0. All coeﬃcients

0 with all eρ

for a grating of arbitrary proﬁle are obtained together by some numerical technique.

In the limit of the grating proﬁle becoming planar, the reﬂection coeﬃcients (and,

therefore, the eﬃciencies) coincide with those for a planar interface. The introduction of

shallow corrugations only slightly perturbs the coeﬃcients [13], and we may then write

ρn ≃ −

β(2)
n − σβ(1)
n
n + σβ(1)
β(2)
n

.

(4)

In the limit of small dissipation, β(2)

n is real–valued for propagating orders in the refracting

medium. As this medium transforms from PPV to NPV, β(2)
changes sign along with σ,
n
and the magnitude of ρn is thus unchanged. But for evanescent (nonspecular) orders, β(2)
n

is imaginary, and thus always positive in accordance with causality. Hence, for nonspecular

orders, the reﬂection coeﬃcients are inverted as the refracting medium is transformed from

PPV to NPV. The evanescent orders then, which play a minor role for the PPV grating,

mediate a much larger interaction between the specular and the nonspecular modes for

the NPV grating.

Equation (4) shows that there is the possibility of a pole for one or more reﬂection

orders. A pole indicates the presence of a bound surface mode, identical to the surface

6

plasmon that occurs at the interface with a metal at optical wavelengths. At least in

a perturbative sense, the enhanced diﬀraction by a NPV grating has the same origin

as other plasmon–mediated eﬀects, including enhanced light transmission [14] and the

“perfect lens” eﬀect [15].

The detailed treatment presented here of diﬀraction from a NPV grating reveals en-

hanced diﬀraction, in agreement with recent experiments. As NPV materials are consid-

ered for various applications, the results found here indicate that great care is necessary

in describing the surfaces of NPV materials. In particular, the recent artiﬁcially struc-

tured metamaterials are based on periodic cells, whose inherent periodicity can lead to a

quite signiﬁcant surface nonhomogeneity, which may assume even greater importance for

surfaces that are not nominally planar.

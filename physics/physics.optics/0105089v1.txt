We study lasing emission from asymmetric resonant cavity (ARC) GaN micro-lasers. By comparing
far-ﬁeld intensity patterns with images of the micro-laser we ﬁnd that the lasing modes are concen-
trated on three-bounce unstable periodic ray orbits, i.e. the modes are scarred. The high-intensity
emission directions of these scarred modes are completely diﬀerent from those predicted by applying
Snell’s law to the ray orbit. This eﬀect is due to the process of “Fresnel ﬁltering” which occurs when
a beam of ﬁnite angular spread is incident at the critical angle for total internal reﬂection.

Understanding the correspondence between classical
phase space structures and wave functions for a gen-
eral classical dynamics is the goal of investigations in
quantum/wave chaotic systems [1]. Generic Hamiltonian
systems have mixed phase spaces which consist of tori
(which support quasi-periodic orbits), stable periodic or-
bits with their associated islands of stability, and unsta-
ble periodic orbits which lie in regions of phase space
with chaotic motion. The simplest possibility, explored
in the early days of the ﬁeld, was that quantum wave-
functions, when projected into phase space would cover
approximately uniformly the various classical invariant
sets; hence wavefunctions associated with chaotic regions
would ﬁll such regions uniformly (with ﬂuctuations) as
would the corresponding ergodic classical trajectories.
We now know [2] that this situation is only realized at
extremely high quantum numbers and that states local-
ized on unstable classical periodic orbits in the chaotic
regions of phase space (“scars”) are common in many
systems of interest [3,4]. The same considerations which
lead to scarred eigenstates of the Schr¨odinger equation
also imply that the wave equation of electromagnetism
will have scarred modes when its boundary conditions
(e.g. shape of a resonator) generate chaotic ray motion;
and indeed such modes have been previously observed in
microwave cavities [5].

It has been shown that dielectric optical micro-cavities
and micro-lasers represent a realization of a wave-chaotic
system and one that presents many unsolved problems
for optical physics [6–10]. For example, quadrupole-
deformed InGaAs and GaAs quantum cascade micro-
lasers which lased on stable bow-tie modes were found
to produce 1000 times higher output power than unde-
formed cylindrical lasers of the same type which lased on
whispering gallery modes [8,10]. The mechanism of mode
selection and the increase of output power in these de-
vices is not currently understood. Recently we reported
preliminary data [11] indicating that in deformed GaN
diode lasers the stable bow-tie modes are not selected
but instead unstable “triangle” modes are the dominant
ones. This was the ﬁrst time that scars had been observed

in an active as opposed to a passive cavity. Moreover,
while these modes are based on triangular periodic or-
bits which strike the boundary near the critical angle for
total internal reﬂection, their emission intensity pattern
is completely diﬀerent from that expected by applying
Snell’s law to the underlying periodic orbit. Below we in-
terpret this surprising ﬁnding as due to an eﬀect we term
“Fresnel Filtering” which arises when a beam of ﬁnite
angular spread is partially transmitted through a dielec-
tric interface near the total internal reﬂection condition.
This is a generic eﬀect, somewhat similar to the well-
studied Goos-H¨anchen shift for a reﬂected beam [15,16],
but it has not to our knowledge been clearly identiﬁed
or studied in the optics literature. We are able to estab-
lish this eﬀect because, in contrast to earlier studies, we
simultaneously collect far-ﬁeld emission patterns and im-
ages of the sidewall of the resonator. Two other groups
have very recently reported lasing emission from dielec-
tric micro-cavities which they interpret as due to scarred
modes [13,14].

The experimental set-up is shown schematically in
Fig. 1(a). A GaN micro-laser of refractive index n = 2.65
is optically pumped at 355nm and emits at 375nm. The
structure is based on MOCVD-grown GaN on a sap-
phire substrate which is etched from a mask using stan-
dard photolithography to create a 2µm high pillar with
a quadrupolar deformation of the cross-section, r(φ) =
r0(1 + ǫ cos 2φ) with r0 = 100µm. Light emitted from
the laser is imaged through an aperture subtending a 5◦
angle and lens onto a CCD camera which is rotated by
an angle θ in the far-ﬁeld from the major axis. A band-
pass ﬁlter restricts the imaged light to the stimulated
emission region of the GaN spectrum. The CCD camera
records an image of the intensity proﬁle on the sidewall of
the pillar as viewed from the angle θ which is converted
from pixels to angular position φW . Summing these in-
tensities yields the total far-ﬁeld intensity emitted in di-
rection θ. Data were taken for quadrupole lasers with
ǫ = 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18, and 0.20 and for other shapes
as well. The full data set will be analyzed in a later work,
here we focus on the data for ǫ = 0.12

data are displayed in a color scale which identiﬁes both
the highest emission directions and the brightest points
on the sidewall (labelled by their angle φW ). The data
show that the maximum intensity in the 1st quadrant is
74◦ and is emitted from the region
observed at angle θ
17◦. The data also show a

number of well-localized bright spots on the sidewall sug-
gests a lasing mode based on a short periodic ray trajec-
tory. The two-bounce stable Fabry-Perot mode would
emit from φW = 90◦ in the direction θ = 90◦. The sta-
ble four-bounce bow-tie mode, dominant in the devices
of Ref. [8], is also inconsistent with our data. It is very
low-Q at this deformation due to its small angle of inci-
dence and would give bright spots at φW = 90◦
17◦,
far away from the brightest spot at φ = 17◦. There is
however a pair of symmetry-related isosceles triangular
orbits (inset, Fig. 2(a)) with bounce points very close to
the observed bright spots (see inset to Fig. 1(b)). These
orbits are unstable for ǫ > 0.098 with trace of the mon-
odromy matrix equal to -5.27 at ǫ = 0.12. The two equiv-
17◦ and
alent bounce points in each triangle at φW =
180◦
0.42, very near to the critical
value, sin χc = 1/n = 0.38, whereas the bounce points
90◦ have sin χ = 0.64 and should emit neg-
at φW =
ligibly (inset to Fig. 2(a)). This accounts for the three
bright spots observed experimentally in Fig. 1(b) (the
197◦ does not emit into the ﬁrst
fourth spot at φW
quadrant, see also inset to Fig. 3(a)). Solutions for the
quasi-bound states of this resonator in the empty cavity
can be found numerically, both in real-space and phase
space, and we ﬁnd that indeed there exist such scars
(see Figs. 2(a), (b)). Here we plot both the modulus
of the electric ﬁeld in real-space and the projection of
the Husimi distribution of the mode onto the surface of
section of the resonator [17]. The Husimi distribution is a
(gaussian) smoothed version of the Wigner transform of
the mode, which represents a wavefunction or mode as a
phase space density consistent with the uncertainty prin-
ciple. Projection onto the surface of section then gives a
measure of the density of rays which strike the boundary
at a given position, φW and a given incidence angle, χ.
Additionally we evaluate this mode in the far-ﬁeld and
ﬁnd an emission pattern in good agreement with the ex-
perimental measurement (see inset, Fig. 1(c)). Finally, if
we take this scarred mode and propagate it numerically
via a lens transform [18] we obtain the result shown in
Fig. 1(c), which is in quite reasonable agreement with
the experimental data of Fig. 1(b), taking into account
that the lasing mode should diﬀer somewhat from the
resonance of the empty cavity. Hence we conclude that
the dominant lasing mode in the experiment is such a
scarred mode.

10−3,
(see Fig. 3). Moreover the ratio λ/nR = 2.8
so we are far into the regime in which the wavelength
is small compared to the geometric features of the res-
onator and ray optics would be expected to be a good
approximation. The resolution of this apparent paradox

clear that the scarred mode, while localized around the
triangle orbit, has a signiﬁcant spread in angle of inci-
dence, ∆ sin χ
0.2. This means that we must regard
the scarred mode as a (non-gaussian) beam with a large
angular spread, with some components almost totally re-
ﬂected and other components transmitted according to
the Fresnel transmission law. This law is rapidly varying
near sin χc = 1/n and strongly favors the components
with lowest angle of incidence. Thus the centroid of the
transmitted beam is shifted away from the tangent di-
rection (i.e. away from the geometric optics result for a
plane wave) by an amount ∆θF F by this eﬀect, which
we call “Fresnel ﬁltering”. Since the sidewall of the res-
onator is curved, strictly speaking the Fresnel law (which
is for an inﬁnite ﬂat surface) does not hold, but the cur-
vature corrections should be small when λ/nR
1, as
is the case here. Thus we can evaluate the Fresnel ﬁl-
tering eﬀect theoretically for a ﬂat dielectric interface.
We express the outgoing beam in the angular spectrum
representation [20] and evaluating the resulting integral
by the saddle point method in the asymptotic farﬁeld
region, we obtain the far-ﬁeld intensity pattern I(θ) [19]:

To model the experiment we assume that the probabil-
ity distribution for the incidence angle is approximately
the same as the cross-section of the Husimi distribu-
tion of Fig. 2(b) evaluated at the triangle bounce point
φW = 17◦. In general, a unimodal distribution of inci-
dence angles produces a bimodal outgoing beam proﬁle,
because Snell’s law spreads out the various transmitted
components diﬀerentially; however near the critical angle
the less refracted lobe is much larger due to the Fresnel
Filtering eﬀect, and it is the angular position of this lobe
that we plot as the beam emission angle χe(θ) in Fig. 3
vs. incidence angle χi. We ﬁnd a very large angular shift
∆θF F , in approximate agreement with experiment.

(n is the index of refraction, k = 2π/λ) and ǫ = 0.12 which
scars the triangular periodic orbits shown in the inset (M. V.
Berry has termed this the “Scar of David”). The four points of
low incidence angle which should emit strongly are indicated.
(b) Husimi (phase-space distribution) for the same mode pro-
jected onto the surface of section of the resonator. The x-axis
is φW and the y-axis is sin χ, the angle of incidence at the
boundary. The surface of section for the corresponding ray
dynamics is shown in black, indicating that there are no stable
islands (orbits) near the high intensity points for this mode.
Instead the high intensity points coincide well with the bounce
points of the unstable triangular orbits (triangles). The black
line denotes sin χc = 1/n for GaN; the triangle orbits are just
above this line and would be strongly conﬁned whereas the
stable bow-tie orbits (bow-tie symbols) are well below and
would not be favored under uniform pumping conditions.

The data of Figs. 1(a), (b) however present an intrigu-
ing puzzle from the point of view of ray optics. A mode
localized on these triangular orbits would be expected to
emit from the four bounce points approximately in the
tangent direction according to Snell’s law; this means
that the bright spot at φW = 17◦ should emit into the
115◦ (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the data clearly
direction θ
indicate that the 17◦ bright spot emits in the direction
θ = 72◦. Thus the emission pattern violates the intuitive

modes. Thus, while the Fresnel Filtering eﬀect should
be present for gaussian resonator modes based on stable
periodic orbits, it appears to be signiﬁcantly enhanced
for unstable (scarred) modes.

In conclusion, we have found that the dominant las-
ing mode in quadrupolar GaN micro-lasers are unstable
(scarred) modes. For resonators with chaotic ray dynam-
ics, such scarred modes play a special role as they allow
high-Q resonances despite the ray chaos. Such modes ex-
hibit a novel emission pattern, which is completely diﬀer-
ent from that expected by applying Snell’s law to the un-
derlying periodic ray trajectory, due to the phenomenon
of Fresnel Filtering.

FIG. 3. (a) Solid line: beam emission angle vs. incidence
angle for a beam of angular spread equivalent to the scarred
mode of Fig. 2 incident on a plane interface. Dashed line
is Snell’s law, the discrepancy is the Fresnel Filtering angle
∆θF F . Inset schematic shows the three emitted “beams” de-
tected in the experiment and illustrates their strong deviation
from Snell’s law (dashed tangent lines). (b) Dependence of an-
gular spread of the “incident beams” vs. nkr0 for scarred tri-
angle modes (triangles) and stable (gaussian) bow-tie modes;
inset shows that the spread decreases as 1/√nkr0 (see inset)
for stable gaussian modes as predicted, whereas no clear vari-
ation with nkr0 is seen for the scarred modes.

The size of the Fresnel ﬁltering eﬀect depends strongly
on the angular beam spread. For gaussian resonator
modes one can show that this spread tends to zero as
1/√nkr0 [19], (see inset Fig. 3(b)). Since our numeri-
cal simulations of the scarred mode are for nkr0 = 129,
4, 440,
whereas the experiment corresponds to nkr0
one may ask whether the large Fresnel Filtering angle
found in Fig. 3(a) (for nkr0 = 129) will extrapolate cor-
rectly to agree with the experiment. As there is currently
no theory of this scaling for scarred modes, we studied the
scaling of the angular width numerically (Fig. 3(b)). We
found no detectable decrease in the angular width with
nkr0, in clear contrast to the behavior of the gaussian

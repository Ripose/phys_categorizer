ABSTRACT: The phase velocity of plane waves propagating in an isotropic chiral medium

can be simultaneously positive for left–circularly polarized light and negative for right–circularly

polarized light (or vice versa). The constitutive parameter regimes supporting this phenomenon

are established for nondissipative and dissipative mediums. The boundary between positive and

negative phase velocity is characterized by inﬁnite phase velocity.

Keywords: negative refraction, positive refraction, inﬁnite phase velocity

1. INTRODUCTION

stitutive relations

An isotropic chiral medium is characterized in the frequency domain by the Tellegen con-

wherein ǫr, µr, and κ are frequency–dependent complex–valued scalars, whereas ǫ0 and µ0 are

the permittivity and permeability of free space (i.e., vacuum).

Electromagnetic waves in this medium are best described using left– and right–handed

Examining plane–wave propagation in an isotropic chiral medium, Mackay [2] obtained

the conditions to delineate negative–phase–velocity (NPV) and positive–phase–velocity (PPV)

propagation therein. Those conditions led to the following question: Can an isotropic chiral

medium simultaneously support NPV and PPV propagation? If the answer is in the aﬃrmative,

an isotropic chiral slab could behave like the so–called perfect lens for right–circularly polarized

(RCP) light from a certain source but not for left–circularly polarized (LCP) light from that

same source (or vice versa) [3].

2. ANALYSIS

Let us begin with the nondissipative scenario wherein ǫr, µr, and κ are all real–valued. The

restriction ǫrµr > 0 is imposed to exclude evanescent plane waves from consideration. We have

the nondissipative isotropic chiral medium simultaneously supports both PPV and NPV plane–

wave propagation. The transition from PPV to NPV (or vice versa) arises as the relevant

wavenumber (kL or kR) passes through zero. Therefore, the PPV/NPV boundary is character-

ized by the magnitude of the phase velocity becoming inﬁnite, as has been reported previously

for isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums [4].

Next we turn to the dissipative scenario wherein ǫr, µr, and κ are all complex–valued. The

wavenumbers lie in the upper half of the complex plane, as dictated by the Kramers–Kronig
relations [5]. Let us consider the regimes ρ > 0 and ρ < 0, where1

The PPV/NPV boundary occurs where the real part of the relevant wavenumber passes through

zero and the magnitude of the phase velocity correspondingly becomes unbounded [4].

3. CONCLUDING REMARKS

When the magnitude of the real part of its relative magnetoelectric parameter κ is suﬃciently

large relative to the magnitudes of the real parts of its relative permittivity ǫr and relative

permeability µr, an isotropic chiral medium can simultaneously support both PPV and NPV

plane–wave propagation, with diﬀerent circular polarization states. Large values of κ are diﬃcult

to realize [7], and perhaps the best option to simultaneously propagate NPV and PPV plane

waves in an isotropic chiral material would be to focus on realizing

< 1 and

< 1 [8].

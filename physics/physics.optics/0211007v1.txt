Abstract

Unusual transmission occurs in the Bragg regime of a stack of layers composed of alternate

right-handed material and left-handed material. The calculation of the reﬂectance with the matrix

transform matrix clearly shows this phenomena. The physical explanation of such a phenomena is

give. The unusual transmission still exists even when the materials are absorbing or dispersive.

FIG. 1: A multilayered system composed with two alternate materials. The ﬁrst and the last layer

are the same kind of material.

Very recently, a substance studied theoretically by Veselago[1] in which the permittivity

and permeability are both negative has been experimentally demonstrated by[2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

One dimensional(1D) alternate layers including a LHM have already been investigated

through calculating the transmittance or the reﬂectance of the structure[8, 9]. Photon

tunnelling eﬀect and Bragg regime are observed in those work. In this letter, we present

an unusual property of such a system that it demonstrates unusual transmission at some

discrete wavelength. An actual model when the material is dispersive and lossy is also

employed at the later part of the letter to conﬁrm the unusual phenomena.

A multilayered system composed with two alternate materials is shown in Fig.

1.

The ﬁrst layer and the last layer of the system we consider here are the same kind of
material. The electric ﬁeld in the lth layer are expressed as El(z)eikxx−iωt with Elz =

for a propagation wave with θl = sin−1 (n1 sin θ1/nl). nl is the refraction index of the lth

A stack of alternate layers known as a DBR exhibits very high reﬂectance in the well-

known Bragg regime. The Bragg regime forms a almost ﬂat top and very steep edges when

the following Bragg condition is satisﬁed.

ϕ1 =

(cos θ1n1d1 + cos θ2n2d2) = k1zn1d1 + k2zn2d2 = Nπ,

, and n1, n2 and d1, d2 are the refractive indices and the thickness of

the two constituents, respectively. When the wave with the wavelength satisfying the above

condition is reﬂected from the interface of diﬀerent periods and reach the ﬁrst interface, the

phase diﬀerence is 2Nπ compared with the wave reﬂected from the ﬁrst interface, which

always increases the reﬂectance. If kz varies a little in value, the phase diﬀerence changes

little around 2Lπ for the reﬂective waves from the a few beginning periods which reﬂects

most of the incident waves. We can still expect they sum to an increasing reﬂectance. That

is why around the center Bragg wavelength, there is a ﬂat top region where the reﬂectance

is almost 1. However, there are always some cases when the above condition is satisﬁed, the

Bragg regime is not found. When that happens, another transparent condition dominates.

The transparent condition is that a multilayered system is transparent to the wavelength,

ϕ2 =

cos θ2n2d2 = k2zn2d2 = Mπ,

the above matrix is a diagonal matrix. The slab is transparent to the waves with the wave-

length satisfying the above condition for both TE and TM polarizations. The waves which

can go through one slab can also go through another same slab. So the whole multilay-

ered system is transparent to the waves. Similar with the Bragg condition, around the

transparent wavelength, the transmission will still hold with some oscillation (e.g., see Fig.

The formation of the Bragg region is the competitive result of the Bragg condition and

the transparent condition. The physical explanation is given roughly as follows. When the

alternate layers are both RHMs, if the Bragg condition and the transparent condition are

both satisﬁed, e.g. ϕ1 = Lπ, ϕ2 = Mπ, (obviously,

>

M

), the Bragg ﬂat regime can

not form. That is because for the very small change of the wavelength ∆(1/λ) = q(1/λ) (q

is a small number),

∆ϕ1|

|

=

qLπ

>

|

|

∆ϕ2|

|

, the phase change for the transparent

condition is smaller than for the Bragg condition, the transparent condition dominates. We

can observe oscillating dotted curves of the reﬂectance in the Fig. 2(a) when the materials

are both RHMs. Note that it is also true when the alternate layers are both LHMs.

However, we can expect

M

<

N

if the structure contains LHMs. The transparent

|

|

|

|

wavelength shown in Eq. 5 can locate where the Bragg regime is formed. The solid lines in

Fig. 2(a) gives the reﬂectance as an example of n2 =

1. The reﬂectance is zero at λ = Λ

−

where the transparent condition 5 is satisﬁed. Diﬀerent from the case of n2 = 1, when λ

deﬂects from Λ, the reﬂectance reaches 1 steadily. Fig. 2(b) shows the reﬂectance for the

same structure when θ1 = 0o and θ1 = 45o for both TE and TM incident waves. The TE

and TM waves have the same reﬂective characteristics. We can obtain some very steeple

valleys in the reﬂectance spectrum at some discrete wavelengths. Only the waves around

the discrete wavelengths can pass the structure.

Fig. 3 is another example when the refraction index of the LHM is n2 =

transmission still occurs. Diﬀerent from Fig. 2(b), other transmission region also exists.

If the LHM if dispersive and lossy as suggested by [10], an actual model should be

employed. As long as the permittivity and the permeability of the materials vary little

around a target frequency, we can still observe the unusual transmission. As an example,

we assume the following frequency dependence for the parameters,

When t = 5, if λ changes 2Λ, ǫ2 and µ2 changes about 10% shown in Fig. 4(a). The steeple

valley at λ = Λ still exists in Fig. 4(c) for γ = 0.15. The small decrease of the reﬂectance at

the region 1 < Λ/λ < 1.5 in Fig. 4(c) is because of the loss caused by the image part of the

refractive index n2. The comparison is also given in Fig. 4(c) with the ideal case. Around

the target wavelength, the unusual transmission still holds.

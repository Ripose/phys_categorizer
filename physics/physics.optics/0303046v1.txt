Optical Resonances in Reﬂectivity near Crystal Modes with Spatial Dispersion

(Dated: September 26, 2013)

We study the eﬀect of spatial dispersion of crystal modes on optical properties like the reﬂectivity
R. As an example for isotropic media, we investigate the simplest model for phonons in ionic crystals
and compare with previous results for highly anisotropic plasmons, which are now understood from
a general point of view. As a consequence of the wave vector dependence of the dielectric function
small eﬀects for the lineshape are predicted. Beyond that, if the frequency of minimal R is near the
pole of the dispersionless dielectric function, the relative amplitude of dips in R with normal and
anomalous dispersion diﬀer signiﬁcantly provided that dissipation and disorder is very low.

Usually, in crystal optics the dependence of the di-
electric function on the wave vector k is neglected be-
cause the wave length λ is much larger than inter atomic
length scales s and eﬀects of spatial dispersion are ex-
pected to be of the order s/λ ≪ 1, see Refs. 1,2 and
references therein. Recently, it was shown for the re-
ﬂectivity near the Josephson plasma resonance (JPR) in
highly anisotropic superconductors3,4, which is an inter-
layer charge oscillation of Cooper pairs, that spatial dis-
persion provides a novel way to stop light and can have
eﬀects of order unity on the relative amplitude of plasma
modes with diﬀerent dispersion. This system is excep-
tional with respect to the symmetry (high anisotropy),
the fact that light is screened away from the JPR, and
the type of the excitation (plasmon).

Here we discuss the possibility that such eﬀects appear
under more general conditions. We choose as a generic
example of a spatially dispersive resonance the simplest
model of one optical phonon band in an ionic crystal5
(also describing certain excitons1) and study the optical
properties of the isotropic phonon-polariton, which is the
lattice vibration coupled to light. Thereby, we determine
under what circumstances similar eﬀects can be expected
in a large class of systems and clarify the origin of pre-
vious results for the highly anisotropic plasmon obtained
in Ref. 3. We show that the eﬀect of spatial dispersion
is of order unity, if the resonance in reﬂectivity is in a
frequency region of size ∆ω/ω0 = s/λ near the pole ω0
of the dispersionless dielectric function ǫ(ω). The ampli-
tudes in reﬂectivity of phonon bands with normal and
anomalous dispersion then diﬀer signiﬁcantly.

Weak disorder and small dissipation turn out to be
essential for signiﬁcant eﬀects due to spatial dispersion,
which is the case in the plasmon system of the JPR be-
low the superconducting gap. In insulators, e.g. in ionic
crystals with perfect lattice symmetry and weak disorder,
these ideal conditions might be realized as well, while in
metals similar eﬀects would be strongly overdamped.

For deﬁniteness, to solve Eq. (2), we consider the spa-
tially dispersive dielectric constant ǫ(ω, q), q = skz,
q ∈ [0, 2π], of an ionic crystal, which can be obtained
by solving the microscopic equation of motion for the
ions1 (deviations due to surface eﬀects are neglected)

persion of the crystal mode, and ρ is the damping due
to disorder (ρ/ω0 ∼ 10−2 for NaCl, see Ref. 5). Since
α/d ≪ 1, the wave vector dependence of the oscillator
strength can be neglected. The sign of d determines the
shape of the dispersion and both d > 0 (normal disper-
sion) and d < 0 (anomalous dispersion) naturally appear
in ionic crystals due to the backfolding of the modes into
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (e.g. realized in fcc structured
NaCl for the directions kk[100] and kk[111], see Ref. 5).
The dielectric function in Eq. (3) is also a model for cer-
tain excitons, where the damping ρ/ω0 ∼ 10−4 is much
smaller, see Ref. 1.

optical (TO) phonon. Multiple modes q1, q2 are excited by
incident light of frequency ω according to the solutions of
Eq. (2). The appearance of an extremal frequency ωe, where
the group velocity vgz = ∂ω/∂kz vanishes and q changes sign,

and a crystal mode with anomalous dispersion.

is conserved due to translational invariance parallel to
the surface (θ is the angle of incidence). The dielectric
constant parallel to the surface ǫa(ω) = ǫa0(1 − ω2
a/ω2)
is non-dispersive. The resonance frequency ωa for the
oscillation parallel to the surface is far above the c axis
plasmon, ωa ≫ ωc0, and for frequencies near ωc0 it fol-
lows ǫa(ω) ≃ −ω2

a/ω2 ≪ −1.

First we will focus on the phonon system. The mode
equation (2) with ǫ(ω) from Eq. (3) has generally two
(complex) solutions n2
p, p = 1, 2, for the refraction in-
dices np = ckp/ω at each frequency ω, i.e. spatial disper-
sion gives rise to the excitation of multiple modes in the
crystal. In a semi-inﬁnite crystal, the causality principle
requires that the group velocity of propagating modes in
z direction, vgz = ∂ω/∂kz, is positive, thus only two of
the four solutions for np are physical, e.g.
for anoma-
lous dispersion the real part of np is negative. When
|n1| ≫ |n2|, only the small mode n2 is light like and ex-
pected to aﬀect optical properties, while for |n1| ≈ |n2|
both modes have to be considered. Note that for two
real modes near ωe, where vgz = 0 (Fig. 1), causality
demands n1 = −n2.

In the absence of spatial dispersion and for vanishing
damping ρ = 0, there are poles in the dielectric func-
tion at the phonon resonance ω0, where k2(ω) ∝ ǫ(ω)
becomes large, cf. Eq. (2). Due to spatial dispersion,
these poles are regularized as shown in Fig. 2. Thereby
the appearance of an extremal frequency ωe, where the
group velocity vgz vanishes, is characteristic for the mix-
ing of the normal dispersive light mode and an anomalous
crystal mode in Fig. 2(a), while in case of equal disper-
sion of light and crystal modes a special frequency ωi,
where q2
2(ωi), appears, see Fig. 2(b). Near
ωe,i the amplitude and lineshape in the reﬂectivity can
be sensitive to the type of dispersion, see below.

1(ωi) = −q2

The excitation of multiple modes poses the problem
that the usual Maxwell boundary conditions, requiring
continuity of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds parallel
to the surface, are insuﬃcient to calculate the relative

amplitudes of these modes.
In the past, this problem
was addressed in a phenomenological way by introducing
so called additional boundary conditions (ABC) for the
macroscopic polarization P. We use the general ABC1

P(z) + l (∂P/∂z) = 0

(z → 0),

(5)

where l is a phenomenological decay length and P =
χ(ω, k)E, with χ(ω, k) = (ǫ(ω, k) − ǫ∞) /4π for the
isotropic medium. These ABC have been justiﬁed for the
anisotropic plasmon in a microscopic model by subtract-
ing the true equation of motion for the surface layer from
the hypothetical bulk equation of this layer, see Ref. 3.
The analogous analysis for the phonon allows to identify
the parameter l in Eq.
(5) with the nearest neighbor
separation s/2 in fcc cubic crystals (e.g. NaCl).

Given the boundary conditions on E and B, we de-
termine the reﬂectivity R at the boundary z = 0 to the
vacuum, which is the ratio of the reﬂected and the inci-
dent energy ﬂux density,

R = |r|2,

(6)

In the dispersionless case the reﬂectivity R shows a dip
with a minimal value Rmin = 0 at ǫ(ω) = κ2 = 1, while
the frequency range of total reﬂection, R = 1, between
the pole and the zero of ǫ is bounded by sharp edges
in R(ω), see Fig. 3. In the following we will show how
spatial dispersion can reduce the amplitude 1 − Rmin of
the dip in R near κ = 1, and modify the lineshape of R
close to the region of total reﬂection (cf. Fig. 3).

For a spatially dispersive medium in the simplest case
of normal incident light, where two transverse modes
kp = (0, 0, kp), p = 1, 2, are excited, we expand the elec-

The above expressions for κ enter the reﬂectivity R,
see Eq. (6). The diﬀerence in Eqs. (7), (8) arises from
the anisotropy ǫa 6= ǫc in the plasmon system. Away
from ωe,i, where |n1| ≫ |n2|, Eq. (7) reduces to κiso = n2
and the usual Fresnel theory is recovered, i.e. the smaller
(light like) refraction index determines the optical prop-
erties of the medium.
In the same limit Eq. (8) reads
κaniso = n2/(ǫa cos θ), i.e. the value of κ is suppressed
due to the strong anisotropy |ǫa| ≫ 1.

For d < 0 close to ωe, where |n1| ∼ |n2| and the
group velocity vgz vanishes, the standard Fresnel the-
ory is invalid and small length scales, which enter the
reﬂectivity R via the parameter ξ, become relevant. The
amplitude 1 − Rmin of the dip for isotropic phonons
and anisotropic plasmons is equal to (1 + ξ2)−1 ≈ 1
and 2/ (cid:0)(1 + ǫ2
aξ2 cos2 θ)1/2 + 1(cid:1) < 1 respectively. As
ǫaξ ∼ O(1), 1 − Rmin is signiﬁcantly suppressed in the
anisotropic system, while ξ ≪ 1 is negligible for the
isotropic one. Note that at the frequency ωe, where the
(positive) solutions k2
p of Eq. (2) merge (cf. Fig. 1) and
n1 = −n2 due to causality, κiso in Eq. (7) is purely imag-
inary and thus R = 1, see Eq. (6). This indicates that
the band edge ω0 of the dispersionless theory is slightly
shifted to lower frequencies ωe due to spatial dispersion,
∆ω/ω0 = (ω0 − ωe)/ω0 ∼ p|d|s/λ ∼ ξ (Figs. 3, 4).

For d > 0 near ωi and above ω0, one solution k2 of
Eq. (2) is positive, Fig. 3(a), and thus creates a tail,
where R < 1 instead of R = 1, see Fig. 4. The diﬀerence

dispersion for damping ρ/ω0 ∼ ξ is ∼ 1% near the upper
band edge of the lower polariton branch, see Fig. 4.

These eﬀects on the phonon lineshape in the reﬂectiv-
ity R are small and, in particular, the amplitude 1−Rmin
of the dip above ω0 is not aﬀected, see Fig. 3(c). In com-
parison with the anisotropic plasmon, where a strong de-
pendence of the dip amplitude on spatial dispersion was
reported3, we seek to identify the crucial diﬀerence to
the present system and under what circumstances such
an eﬀect might appear in the phonon system.

Firstly, we conclude from Eq. (4) that in an anisotropic
z ∼ n2 = ǫa − (ǫa/ǫc) sin2 θ
system (ǫa 6= ǫc) a pole in k2
like in Fig. 2 is created in oblique incidence (θ 6= 0) at the
zero of ǫc in a similar way as it appears in the isotropic
case at the pole of ǫ(ω). More importantly, the strong
anisotropy |ǫa| ∼ 1/ξ ≫ 1 (∼ 104 for JPR) suppresses
the value of κaniso in Eq. (8), such that the dip in R near
κ = 1 is close to the bandedge and thus in the frequency
range of the special points ωe,i (cf. Fig. 2), where spatial
dispersion is relevant, see Fig. 5.

Guided by this observation, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant eﬀects
on the dip amplitude 1 − Rmin, if the minimum in R is
within the frequency interval ∆ω/ω0 ∼ s/λ near the pole
of ǫ(ω). This can be achieved (a) by a second background
b /(ω2 −
dispersionless phonon, ǫ∞ → ǫpole(ω) = ǫ∞ +Sb ω2

b −iρbω), which is suﬃciently close to ω0, (ω0−ωb)/ω0 ∼
|ǫpole(ω0)| ∼ 1/ξ ≫ 1, or similarly (b) in
s/λ ∼ ξ, i.e.
extreme oblique incidence (θ ≈ π/2 − ξ1/2), where the

dispersionless κ = n/ǫ cos θ = (ǫ − sin2 θ)(1/2)/ǫ cos θ is 1
at ω0+O(ξ). This results in signiﬁcant diﬀerences in Rmin
for normal and anomalous dispersive phonon bands, if the
dissipation is very small, see Fig. 7. Physically the larger
suppression of 1 − Rmin for dispersion d > 1 is related to
the fact that near ωi only a single propagating mode is
excited, while the other one decays into the crystal. This
eﬀect is of order unity and the dip of width ∆ω/ω0 ∼ ξ
in R can be resolved in optical phonon spectra6.

In conclusion, for isotropic phonons small eﬀects for
the lineshape in reﬂectivity due to spatial dispersion are

can depend signiﬁcantly on the sign of the dispersion, if
the frequency of minimal reﬂection is in a small distance
∆ω/ω0 ∼ s/λ to the dispersive resonance (Fig. 7). This
can be realized in strongly anisotropic systems such as
the JPR3 or in the isotropic case due to a second almost
degenerate resonance or for nearly parallel incidence.

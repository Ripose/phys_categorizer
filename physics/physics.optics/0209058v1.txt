Abstract. A Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to track light rays in
cylindrical ﬁbres by ray optics. The trapping eﬃciencies for skew and meridional
rays in active ﬁbres and distributions of characteristic quantities for all trapped
light rays have been calculated. The simulation provides new results for curved
ﬁbres, where the analytical expressions are too complex to be solved. The light
losses due to sharp bending of ﬁbres are presented as a function of the ratio of
curvature to ﬁbre radius and bending angle. It is shown that a radius of curvature
to ﬁbre radius ratio of greater than 65 results in a loss of less than 10% with the
loss occuring in the initial stage of the bend (at bending angles Φ ∼ π/8 rad).

1. Introduction

Active optical ﬁbres are becoming more and more important in the ﬁeld of detection
and measurement of ionising radiation and particles. Light is generated inside the ﬁbre
either through interaction with the incident radiation (scintillating ﬁbres) or through
absorption of primary light (wavelength-shifting ﬁbres). Plastic ﬁbres with large core
diameters, i.e. where the wavelength of the light being transmitted is much smaller
than the ﬁbre diameter, are commercially available and readily fabricated, have good
timing properties and allow a multitude of diﬀerent geometrical designs. The low
costs of plastic materials make it possible for many experiments to use such ﬁbres
in large quantities, particularly in highly segmented tracking detectors and sampling
calorimeters (see reference [1] for a review of plastic ﬁbres in high energy physics).
Although for many years ﬁbres have been the subject of extensive studies, only
fragmentary calculations of trapping eﬃciencies and light losses in curved ﬁbres have
been performed for multi-mode ﬁbres. We have therefore performed a full simulation
of photons propagating in simple circularly curved ﬁbres in order to quantify the
losses caused by the bending and to establish the dependence of these losses on the
angle of the bend. We have also brieﬂy investigated the time dispersion in ﬁbres. For
our calculations the most common type of ﬁbre in particle physics is assumed. This
standard ﬁbre is speciﬁed by a polystyrene core of refractive index ncore = 1.6 and
a thin polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cladding of refractive index nclad = 1.49,

Computational studies of light in straight and curved optical ﬁbres

where the indices are given at a wavelength of 590 nm. Another common cladding
material is ﬂuorinated polymethacrylate which has a slightly lower index of reﬂection
of nclad = 1.42. Typical diameters are in the range of 0.5 – 1.5 mm.

The treatment of small diameter optical ﬁbres involves electromagnetic theory
applied to dielectric waveguides, which was ﬁrst achieved by Snitzer [2] and Kapany [3].
Although this approach provides insight into the phenomenon of total
internal
reﬂection and eventually leads to results for the ﬁeld distributions and electromagnetic
radiation for curved ﬁbres, it is advantageous to use ray optics for applications to
large diameter ﬁbres where the waveguide analysis is an unnecessary complication.
In ray optics a light ray may be characterised by its path along the ﬁbre. The path
of a meridional ray is conﬁned to a single plane, all other modes of propagation
are known as skew rays.
In general, the projection of a meridional ray on a plane
perpendicular to the ﬁbre axis is a straight line, whereas the projection of a skew ray
changes its orientation with every reﬂection. In the special case of a cylindrical ﬁbre
all meridional rays pass through the ﬁbre axis. The optics of meridional rays in ﬁbres
was developed in the 1950s [4] and can be found in numerous textbooks, for example
in references [5, 6].

This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the analytical expressions of
trapping eﬃciencies for skew and meridional rays in active, i.e. light generating, ﬁbres.
The analytical description of skew rays is too complex to be solved for sharply curved
ﬁbres and the necessity of a simulation becomes evident. In Section 3 a simulation code
is outlined that tracks light rays in cylindrical ﬁbres governed by a set of geometrical
rules derived from the laws of optics. Section 4 presents the results of the simulations.
These include distributions of the characteristic properties which describe light rays
in straight and curved ﬁbres, where special emphasis is placed on light losses due to
the sharp bending of ﬁbres. Light dispersion is brieﬂy reviewed in the light of the
results of the simulation. The last section provides a short summary.

2. Trapping of Photons

When using scintillating or wavelength-shifting ﬁbres in charged particle detectors
the trapped light as a fraction of the intensity of the emitted light is important in
determining the light yield of the application. All rays which are totally internally
reﬂected within the cylinder of the ﬁbre are considered as trapped. It is very well
known that the critical angle for internal reﬂection at the sides of the ﬁbre is the
limiting factor (see for example [7] and references therein). For very low light
intensities as encountered in many particle detectors the photon representation is
more appropriate to use than a description by light rays. In such applications single
photon counting is often necessary.

The geometrical path of any rays in optical ﬁbres, including skew rays, was ﬁrst
analysed in a series of papers by Potter [7] and Kapany [8]. The treatment of angular
dependencies in our paper is based on that. The angle γ is deﬁned as the angle of
the projection of the light ray in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the ﬁbre with
respect to the normal at the point of reﬂection. One may describe γ as a measure
of the “skewness” of a particular ray, since meridional rays have this angle equal to
zero. The polar angle, θ′, is deﬁned as the angle of the light ray in a plane containing
the ﬁbre axis and the point of reﬂection with respect to the normal at the point of
reﬂection. It can be shown that the angle of incidence at the walls of the cylinder, α,
is given by cos α = cos θ′ cos γ. The values of the two orthogonal angles θ′ and γ will

Computational studies of light in straight and curved optical ﬁbres

be preserved independently for a particular photon at every reﬂection along its path.
In general for any ray to be internally reﬂected, the inequality sin α ≥ sin θ′
crit =
nclad /ncore must be fulﬁlled, where the critical angle, θ′
crit , is given by the index of
refraction of the ﬁbre core, ncore, and that of the cladding, nclad . In the meridional
approximation the above equations lead to the well known critical angle condition
for the polar angle, θ′ ≥ θ′
crit , which describes an acceptance cone of semi-angle,
θ [= π/2 − θ′], with respect to the ﬁbre axis. Thus, in this approximation all light
within the forward cone will be trapped and undergo multiple total internal reﬂections
to emerge at the end of the ﬁbre.

For the further discussion in this paper it is convenient to use the axial angle, θ,
as given by the supplement of θ′, and the skew angle, γ, to characterise any light ray
in terms of its orientation, see ﬁgure 1.

The ﬂux transmitted by a ﬁbre is determined by an integration over the angular
distribution of the light emitted within the acceptance domain, i.e. the phase space
of possible propagation modes. Using an expression given by Potter [9] and setting
the transmission function which parameterises the light attenuation to unity, the light
ﬂux can be written as follows:

where Ω is the element of solid angle, γ(θ) refers to the maximum axial angle allowed
by the critical angle condition, ρ is the radius of a cylindrical ﬁbre and I(θ, φ) is the
angular distribution of the emitted light in the ﬁbre core. The two terms, Fm and
Fs, refer to either the meridional or skew cases, respectively. The lower limit of the
integral for Fs is γ = arccos (sin θcrit / sin θ).

The trapping eﬃciency for forward propagating photons, Ω1/2, may be deﬁned
as the fraction of totally internally reﬂected photons. The formal expression for the
trapping eﬃciency, including skew rays, is derived by dividing the transmitted ﬂux by
the total ﬂux through the cross-section of the ﬁbre core, F0. For isotropic emission of
ﬂuorescence light the total ﬂux equals 4π2ρ2I0. Then, the ﬁrst term of equation (1)
gives the trapping eﬃciency in the meridional approximation,

Ω1/2

m = Fm/F0 =

(1 − cos θcrit ),

where all photons are considered to be trapped if θ ≤ θcrit , independent of their
actual skew angles. The latter formula yields a trapping eﬃciency of Ω1/2
m = 3.44%
for standard plastic ﬁbres with ncore = 1.6 and nclad = 1.49.

The integration of the second term of equation (1) gives the contributions of all

skew rays to the trapping eﬃciency. Integrating by parts, one gets

which is 6.64% for standard plastic ﬁbres,
i.e. approximately twice the trapping
eﬃciency in the meridional approximation. Nevertheless, for long ﬁbres the eﬀective
trapping eﬃciency is closer to Ω1/2
m than to Ω1/2 since skew rays have a much longer
optical path length and therefore get attenuated more quickly see Section 4 for a
quantitative analysis.

3. Description of the Photon Tracking Code

The simulation code is written in Fortran. Light rays are generally represented as
lines and determined by two points, ~r and ~r ′. The points of incidence of rays with
the ﬁbre-cladding boundary are determined by solving the appropriate systems of
algebraic equations. In the case of a straight ﬁbre the geometrical representation of a
straight cylinder is used resulting in the quadratic equation

′
(x + (x

− x) × m)2 + (y + (y

− y) × m)2 − ρ2 = 0,

′

(6)

where ρ is the ﬁbre radius and the ﬁbre axis is along the z-direction. The positive
solution for the parameter m deﬁnes the point of incidence, ~rR, on the cylinder wall.
In the case of a ﬁbre curved in a circular path, the cylinder equation is generalised by
the torus equation

R −

(y + (y

− y) × m)2 − ρ2 = 0,

(cid:17)

(7)

where the ﬁbre is bent in the xz-plane with a radius of curvature Rcurve. The roots of
this fourth degree polynomial are calculated using Laguerre’s method [10]. It requires
complex arithmetic and an estimate for the root to be found. The initial estimate is
given by the intersection point of the light ray and a straight cylinder that has been
rotated and translated to the previous reﬂection point. The smallest positive, real
solution for m is then used to determine the reﬂection point, ~rR.

In both cases the angle of incidence, α, is given by cos α = ~rin ·~n, where ~n denotes
the unit vector normal to the ﬁbre-cladding boundary at the point of reﬂection and
~rin = (~r − ~rR)/|~r − ~rR| is the unit incident propagation vector. The unit propagation
vector after reﬂection, ~rout , is then calculated by mirroring ~rin with respect to the
normal vector: ~rout = ~rin − 2~n cos α.

4. Results of the Photon Tracking Code

Figure 1 shows the passage of a skew ray along a straight ﬁbre. The light ray has
been generated oﬀ-axis with an axial angle of θ = 0.42 and would not be trapped if it
were meridional. The ﬁgure illustrates the preservation of the skew angle, γ, during
the propagation of skew rays.

4.1. Trapping Eﬃciency and Acceptance Domain

Figure 2 shows the total acceptance domain and its splitting into the meridional and
skew regions in the meridional ray approximation. The ﬁgure gives the values for the
two trapping eﬃciencies which can be determined by integrating over the two angular
regions. The integrals are identical in value to formulae 2 and 4, when the photons
are generated randomly on the cross-section of the ﬁbre with an isotropic angular
distribution in the forward direction.

A skew ray can be totally internally reﬂected at larger angles θ than meridional
rays and the relationship between the minimum permitted skew angle, γ, at a given
axial angle, θ, is determined by the critical angle condition: cos γ = sin θcrit / sin θ.
Inside this region the phase space density is not constant but increases with cos γ2
and sin θ.

It is obvious from the critical angle condition that a photon emitted close to the
cladding has a higher probability to be trapped than when emitted close to the centre of
the ﬁbre. Figure 3(a) shows the trapping eﬃciency as a function of the radial position,
ˆρ, of the light emitter in the ﬁbre core. The trapping eﬃciency is almost independent of
the radial position for ˆρ < 0.8 and the meridional approximation, exactly valid only at
ˆρ = 0, is a good estimate. At ˆρ ≥ 0.9 the approximation signiﬁcantly underestimates
the trapping eﬃciency. This fact has been discussed before, e.g. in [11]. Figure 3(b)
shows the the trapping eﬃciency as a function of the axial angle. All photons with
axial angles below θcrit are trapped in the ﬁbre, whereas photons with larger angles
are trapped only if their skew angle exceeds the minimum permitted skew angle. It
can be seen that the trapping eﬃciency falls oﬀ very steeply with the axial angle.

4.2. Light Attenuation

A ﬁbre can conveniently be characterised by its attenuation length over which the
signal amplitude is attenuated to 1/e of its original value. However, light attenuation
has many sources, among them self-absorption, optical non-uniformities, reﬂection
losses and absorption by impurities.

Restricting the analysis to the two main sources of loss, the transmission through
a ﬁbre can be represented for any given axial angle by T = exp [−P (θ)LF /λ] × qηLF ,
where the ﬁrst term describes light losses due to bulk absorption and scattering, and
the second term describes light losses due to imperfect reﬂections which can be caused
by a rough surface or variations in the refractive indices. A comparison of some
of our own measurements to determine the attenuation length of plastic ﬁbres with
other available data indicates that a reasonable value for the bulk absorption length is
λ ∼ 3 m. Most published data suggest a deviation of the reﬂection coeﬃcient, which
parameterises the internal reﬂectivity, from unity between 5 × 10−5 and 6.5 × 10−5
[12]. Only for very small diameter ﬁbres (∼ 10 µm) are the resulting scattering lengths
of the same order as the absorption lengths. Because of the large radii of the ﬁbres
discussed reﬂection losses are not relevant for the transmission function. A reasonable
value of q = 0.9999 is used in the simulation to account for all losses proportional to
the number of reﬂections.

Internal reﬂections being less than total give rise to so-called “leaky” or non-
guided modes, where part of the electromagnetic energy is radiated away at the
reﬂection points. They populate a region deﬁned by axial angles above the critical
angle and skew angles slightly larger than the ones for totally internally reﬂected

Computational studies of light in straight and curved optical ﬁbres

photons. These modes are taken into account by using the well known Fresnel
reﬂection formulas, where unpolarised light is assumed and the reﬂection coeﬃcients
for the two planes of polarisation are averaged. However, it is obvious that non-guided
modes are lost quickly.

The absorption and emission processes in ﬁbres are spread out over a wide
band of wavelengths and the attenuation is known to be wavelength dependent.
For simplicity only monochromatic light is assumed in the simulation and highly
wavelength-dependent eﬀects like Rayleigh scattering are not included explicitly. Light
rays are tracked in the ﬁbre core only and no tracking takes place in the surrounding
cladding. In long ﬁbres cladding modes will eventually be lost, but for lengths < 1 m
they can contribute to the transmission function and will lead to a dependence of the
attenuation length on the distance from the excitation source.

A question of practical

importance for the estimation of the light output
of a particular ﬁbre application is its transmission function.
In the meridional
approximation and substituting exp(− ln q) by exp(1 − q) the attenuation length can
be written as

Λm = − sec θcrit LF [1/λ + (1 − q) sin θcrit /2ρ] ,

which evaluates to Λm = 2.8 m for the given attenuation parameters. The correct
transmission function can be found by integrating over the normalised path length
distribution (which will be discussed in the following section):

T =

1
N Z

∞

P =0

dN/dP e

−P L/λ dP.

(8)

(9)

Figure 4 shows this transmission function versus the ratio of ﬁbre to absorption length,
LF /Λm. A simple exponential ﬁt, T ∝ exp [−LF /Λeﬀ ], applied to the points results
in an eﬀective attenuation length of Λeﬀ = 2.4 m. This description is suﬃcient to
parameterise the transmission function for LF /Λm ≥ 0.2, at lower values the light is
attenuated faster. The diﬀerence of order 15% to the meridional attenuation length
is attributed to the tail of the path length distribution.

4.3. Propagation of Photons

The analysis of trapped photons is based on the total photon path length per axial
ﬁbre length, P , the number of internal reﬂections per axial ﬁbre length, η, and the
optical path length between successive internal reﬂections, lR, where we follow the
nomenclature of Potter and Kapany. It should be noted that these three variables are
not independent: P = η × lR.

Figure 5 shows the distribution of the normalised optical path length, P (θ), for
photons reaching the exit end of straight and curved ﬁbres of 0.6 mm radius. The ﬁgure
also gives results for curved ﬁbres of two diﬀerent radii of curvature. The distribution
of path lengths shorter than the path length for meridional photons propagating at
the critical angle is almost ﬂat. It can easily be shown that the normalised path length
along a straight ﬁbre is given by the secant of the axial angle and is independent of
other ﬁbre dimensions: P (θ) = sec θ. In case of the curved ﬁbre the normalised path
length of the trapped photons is less than the secant of the axial angle and photons
on near meridional paths are refracted out of the ﬁbre most.

The distribution of the normalised number of reﬂections, η(θ),

for photons
reaching the exit end of straight and curved ﬁbres is shown in ﬁgure 6. Again,
the ﬁgure gives results for curved ﬁbres of two diﬀerent radii of curvature. The

Computational studies of light in straight and curved optical ﬁbres

7

number of reﬂections a photon experiences scales with the reciprocal of the ﬁbre radius.
In the meridional approximation the normalised number of reﬂections is related by
simple trigonometry to the axial angle and the ﬁbre radius: ηm(θ) = tan θ/2ρ. The
distribution of ηm, based on the distribution of axial angles for the trapped photons,
is represented by the dashed line. The upper limit, η(θcrit ), is indicated in the plot by
a vertical line. The number of reﬂections made by a skew ray, ηs(θ), can be calculated
for a given skew angle: ηs(θ) = ηm(θ)/ cos γ. It is clear that this number increases
signiﬁcantly if the skew angle increases. From the distributions it can be seen that in
curved ﬁbres the trapped photons experience fewer reﬂections on average.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of the reﬂection length, lR(θ), for photons reaching
the exit end of ﬁbres of radius ρ = 0.6 mm. The reﬂection length will scale with the
ﬁbre radius. The left ﬁgure shows lR(θ) for three diﬀerent over-all ﬁbre lengths and
the attenuation behaviour of the photons is made apparent by the non-vanishing
attenuation parameters used. Short reﬂection lengths correspond to long optical path
lengths and large numbers of reﬂections. Because of the many reﬂections and the
long total paths traversed, these photons will be attenuated faster than photons with
larger reﬂection lengths. This reveals the high attenuation of rays with large skew
angles. In the meridional approximation the reﬂection length is related to the axial
angle by:
In the ﬁgure the minimum reﬂection length allowed by
the critical angle condition is shown by a vertical line at lR(θcrit ) = 3.29 mm. The
right ﬁgure shows lR(θ) in sharply curved ﬁbres of two diﬀerent radii of curvature. It
can be seen that the region of highest attenuation is close to the reﬂection length for
photons propagating at the critical angle. On average photons propagate with smaller
reﬂection lengths along the curved ﬁbre.

lR = 2ρ/ cos θ.

In contrast to the analysis of straight ﬁbres an approximation of the sharply
curved ﬁbre by meridional rays is not a very good one, since only a very small fraction
of the light rays have paths lying in the bending plane. It is clear that when a ﬁbre
is curved the path length, the number of reﬂections and the reﬂection length of a
particular ray in the ﬁbre are aﬀected, which is clearly seen in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, where
the over-all ﬁbre length is 50 cm. The average optical path length and the average
number of reﬂections in a ﬁbre curved over a circular arc are less than those for the
same ray in a straight ﬁbre for those photons which remain trapped.

4.4. Trapping Eﬃciency and Losses in Sharply Curved Fibres

One of the most important practical issues in implementing optical ﬁbres into compact
particle detector systems are macro-bending losses. In general, some design parameters
of ﬁbre applications, especially if the over-all size of the detector system is important,
depend crucially on the minimum permissible radius of curvature. By using the
waveguide analysis a loss formula in terms of the Poynting vector can be derived [13],
but studies on bending losses in single-mode ﬁbres cannot be directly applied to large
diameter ﬁbres. By using ray optics for those ﬁbres the analysis of the passage of skew
rays along a curved ﬁbre becomes highly complex.

The angle of incidence of a light ray at the tensile (outer) side of the ﬁbre is always
smaller than at the compressed side and photons propagate either by reﬂections on
both sides or in the extreme meridional case by reﬂections on the tensile side only. If
the ﬁbre is curved over an arc of constant radius of curvature photons can be refracted,
and will then no longer be trapped, at the very ﬁrst reﬂection point on tensile side.
Therefore, the trapping eﬃciency for photons entering a curved section of ﬁbre towards

Computational studies of light in straight and curved optical ﬁbres

8

the tensile side is reduced most. Figure 8 quantiﬁes the dependence of the trapping
eﬃciency on the azimuthal angle between the bending plane and the photon path for
a curved ﬁbre with a radius of curvature Rcurve = 2 cm.

Figure 9 displays the explicit dependence of the transmission function for ﬁbres
curved over circular arcs of 90◦ on the radius of curvature to ﬁbre radius ratio for
diﬀerent ﬁbre radii, ρ = 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 and 1.2 mm. No further light attenuation is
assumed. Evidently, the number of photons which are refracted out of a sharply
curved ﬁbre increases very rapidly with decreasing radius of curvature. The losses are
dependent only on the ratio, since no inherent length scale is involved, justifying the
introduction of the curvature to ﬁbre radius ratio as a scaling variable. The light loss
due to bending of the ﬁbre is about 10% for a radius of curvature of 65 times the ﬁbre
radius.

In the meridional approximation in the bending plane a cut-oﬀ angle

cos θcut =

cos θcrit

R + 2ρ
R + ρ

(10)

(11)

can be introduced so that photons emitted with this axial angle cos θcut are reﬂected at
the tensile side of the ﬁbre with the critical angle. Figure 10 shows the passage of this
meridional ray through the ﬁbre. Reference [14] makes a comparison of the meridional
approximation with the waveguide analysis and justiﬁes its use. A transmission
function can be estimated from this cut-oﬀ angle by assuming that all photons with
axial angles θ > θcut are refracted out of the ﬁbre:

T = 1 −

1
1 + Rcurve/ρ

cos θcrit
1 − cos θcrit

.

This transmission function is shown in ﬁgure 9 and it is obvious that it is
overestimating the light losses, because of the larger axial angles allowed for skew
rays.

The ﬁrst point of reﬂection for photons entering a curved section of ﬁbre can be
characterised by the bending angle, Φ, through which the ﬁbre is bent. Close to the
critical angle the angular phase space density is highest. For photons emitted towards
the tensile side the corresponding bending angle is related to the axial angle of the
photon, Φ = θcrit −θcut . For a ﬁbre radius ρ = 0.6 mm and radii of curvature Rcurve =
1, 2, and 5 cm the above formula leads to bending angles Φ = 0.19, 0.08 and 0.03 rad,
respectively.

Photons emitted from the ﬁbre axis towards the compressed side are not lost
at this side, however, they experience at least one reﬂection on the tensile side
if the bending angle exceeds the limit Φlimit = arccos [Rcurve/(Rcurve + 2 ρ)] ≈
arccos [1 − 2 ρ/Rcurve]. A change in the transmission function should occur at bending
angles between Φlimit /2, where all photons emitted towards the tensile side have
experienced a reﬂection, and Φlimit , where this is true for all photons. Figure 11
shows the transmission as a function of bending angle, Φ, for the same ﬁbre conditions
as before. Once a sharply curved ﬁbre with a ratio Rcurve/ρ > 83 is bent through
angles Φ ∼ π/8 rad light losses do not increase any further. The limiting angles range
from Φlimit = 1.06 rad to Φlimit = 0.44 rad and are indicated in the ﬁgure by arrows.
At much smaller ratios Rcurve/ρ the meridional approximation is no longer valid to
describe this initial behaviour.

Contours of phase space distributions for photons refracted out of sharply curved
ﬁbres with radii of curvature Rcurve = 2 and 5 cm are shown in ﬁgure 2. The contours

Computational studies of light in straight and curved optical ﬁbres

demonstrate that skew rays from a small region close to the cos γ curve are getting
lost. The smaller the radius of curvature, the larger the aﬀected phase space region.

4.5. Light Dispersion

A pulse of light, consisting of several photons propagating along a ﬁbre, broadens
in time.
In active ﬁbres, three eﬀects are responsible for the time distribution of
photons reaching the ﬁbre exit end. Firstly the decay time of the ﬂuorescent dopants,
usually of the order of a few nanoseconds, secondly the wavelength spectrum of the
emitted light, which leads to diﬀerent propagation velocities for diﬀerent photons in a
dispersive medium, and thirdly the fact that photons on diﬀerent paths have diﬀerent
transit times to reach the ﬁbre exit end, known as inter-modal dispersion. The timing
resolution of scintillators are often of paramount importance.

The transit time in ray optics is simply given by τ = P (θ)/ccore, where ccore is the
speed of light in the ﬁbre core. The simulation results on the transit time are shown
in ﬁgure 12. The full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the pulses in the time
spectrum are presented for four diﬀerent ﬁbre lengths. The resulting dispersion has to
be compared with the time dispersion in the meridional approximation which is simply
the diﬀerence between the shortest transit time τ (θ = 0) and the longest transit time
τ (θ = θcrit ): ∆τ = LF (sec θcrit − 1)/ccore, where LF is the total axial length of the
ﬁbre. The dispersion evaluates for the diﬀerent ﬁbre lengths to 197 ps for 0.5 m, 393 ps
for 1 m, 787 ps for 2 m and 1181 ps for 3 m. Those numbers are in good agreement with
the simulation, although there are tails associated to the propagation of skew rays.
With the attenuation parameters of our simulation the fraction of photons arriving
later than τ (θ = θcrit ) decreases from 37.9% for a 0.5 m ﬁbre to 32% for a 3 m ﬁbre
due to the stronger attenuation of the skew rays in the tail.

5. Summary

We have simulated the propagation of photons in straight and curved optical ﬁbres.
The simulations have been used to evaluate the loss of photons propagating in ﬁbres
curved in a circular path in one plane. The results show that loss of photons due to
the curvature of the ﬁbre is a simple function of radius of curvature to ﬁbre radius
ratio and is < 10% if the ratio is > 65. The simulations also show that for larger
ratios this loss takes place in the initial stage of the bend (Φ ∼ π/8) during which
a new distribution of photon angles is established. The photons which survive this
initial loss then propagate without further bending losses.

We have also used the simulation to investigate the dispersion of transit times of
photons propagating in straight ﬁbres. For ﬁbre lengths between 0.5 and 3 m we ﬁnd
that approximately two thirds of the photons arrive within the spread of transit times
which would be expected from the use of the simple meridional ray approximation
and the refractive index of the ﬁbre core. The remainder of the photons arrive in a
tail at later times due to their helical paths in the ﬁbre. The fraction of photons in
the tail of the distribution decreases only slowly with increasing ﬁbre length and will
depend on the attenuation parameters of the ﬁbre.

We ﬁnd that when realistic bulk absorption and reﬂection losses are included in
the simulation for a straight ﬁbre, the overall transmission can not be described by
a simple exponential function of propagation distance because of the large spread in
optical path lengths between the most meridional and most skew rays.

We anticipate that these results on the magnitude of bending losses will be of use

for the design of particle detectors incorporating sharply curved active ﬁbres.

Simulated transmission function for a straight ﬁbre with a bulk
light absorption length λ = 3 m and a reﬂection coeﬃcient q = 0.9999. The
transmission as a function of the ratio of ﬁbre to absorption length, LF /Λm, is
calculated from the optical path length distribution. A simple exponential ﬁt
results in an eﬀective attenuation length of Λeﬀ = 2.4 m. The dashed line shows
the transmission function in the meridional approximation with Λm = 2.8 m.

Abstract. The strong waveguide dispersion in photonic crystal ﬁbres provides
unique opportunities for nonlinear optics with a zero-dispersion wavelength λ0 far
below the limit of ∼ 1.3 µm set by the material dispersion of silica. By tuning
the air-hole diameter d, the pitch Λ, and the number of rings of air holes N ,
the strong waveguide dispersion can in principle be used to extend λ0 well into
the visible, albeit to some extend at the cost of multimode operation. We study
in detail the interplay of the zero-dispersion wavelength, the cut-oﬀ wavelength
λc, and the leakage loss in the parameter space spanned by d, Λ, and N . As a
particular result we identify values of d (∼ 500 nm) and Λ (∼ 700 nm) which
facilitate the shortest possible zero-dispersion wavelength (∼ 700 nm) while the
ﬁbre is still single-mode for longer wavelengths.

1. Introduction

Photonic crystal ﬁbres (PCFs) [1, 2] have led to an enormous renewed interest in
nonlinear ﬁbre optics [3, 4, 5, 6]. In particular, the strong anomalous group-velocity
dispersion has facilitated visible super-continuum generation [7], which apart from
being a fascinating and rich non-linear phenomenon [8] also has promising applications
including frequency-comb metrology [9, 10] and optical coherence tomography [11].

(cid:79) (cid:47)

The regular triangular arrangement of sub-micron air-holes running along the
full
is a key concept for the realization
length of the ﬁbre [12, 13], see Fig. 1,
of strong anomalous chromatic dispersion which arises in a competition between
material dispersion and wave-guide dispersion originating from the strong transverse
conﬁnement of light. At the same time the strong transverse conﬁnement of light
also serves to dramatically decrease the eﬀective area and increase the non-linear
coeﬃcient [14] so that very high optical intensities may be achieved relative to the
input power.

The zero-dispersion wavelength may be tuned down to the visible [15, 16] by
carefully increasing the normalized air-hole diameter d/Λ while at the same time
decreasing the pitch Λ. However,
in many cases the very short zero-dispersion
wavelength is achieved at the cost of multi-mode operation. Furthermore, the
reduction of the pitch may require a large number N of rings of air holes in order
to circumvent leakage loss.

In this paper we in detail study the complicated interplay of the zero-dispersion
wavelength λ0, the cut-oﬀ wavelength λc, and the leakage loss in the parameter space
spanned by d, Λ, and N . As a particular result we identify values of d and Λ which
facilitate the shortest possible zero-dispersion wavelength while the ﬁbre is still single-
mode for longer wavelengths, i.e. λc ≤ λ0.

2. Competition between material and wave-guide dispersion

The linear dynamics and response of a waveguide is typically studied within the
framework of temporal harmonic modes, ~E(~r, t) = ~E(~r⊥)e−iωt = ~E(~r⊥)ei(βz−ωt),
where ~E(~r) is a solution to the vectorial wave equation

∇ × ∇ × ~E(~r) = ε(~r, ω)

ω2
c2
Here, ε(~r, ω) = n2(~r, ω) is the spatially dependent dielectric function of the composite
air-silica dielectric medium, see Fig. 1, and n(~r, ω) is the corresponding refractive
index.

~E(~r).

Solving the wave equation, Eq. (1), provides us with the dispersion relation
ω(β) which contains all information on the spatial-temporal linear dynamics of wave
packets and it is furthermore important input for studies of non-linear dynamics.
However, quite often the dynamics and evolution of pulses are quantiﬁed by the derived
dispersion parameters βn = (∂nω/∂nβ)
being recognized as the
inverse group velocity. The group-velocity dispersion β2 is in ﬁber optics commonly
quantiﬁed by the dispersion parameter D (typically in units of ps/nm/km) which can
be written in a variety of ways including

will compress or broaden in time depending on the sign of D. The zero-dispersion
wavelength λ0, deﬁned by D(λ0) = 0, is thus of particular relevance to pulse dynamics
in general and non-linear super-continuum generation in particular. By pumping
the ﬁber with high-intensive ultra-short nano and femto-second pulses near λ0 the
pump pulses will loosely speaking maintain their high intensity for a longer time (or
propagation distance) thus allowing for pronounced non-linear interactions.

The ﬁnite group-velocity dispersion is a consequence of both the dispersive
properties of the host material itself as well as the strong transverse localization of
the light caused by the pronounced spatial variations in the dielectric function. Since
the variation with frequency of the refractive index of silica is modest (at least in the
transparent part of the spectrum) the dielectric function satisﬁes

ε(~r⊥, ω) = ε0(~r⊥, ˜ω) + δε(~r⊥, ω),
δε(~r⊥, ω) = ε(~r⊥, ω) − ε0(~r⊥, ˜ω) ≪ ε0(~r⊥, ω)

where ˜ω is some arbitrary, but ﬁxed frequency where consequently δε = 0. The high
attention to the telecommunication band has often made ˜λ = 1550 nm a typical choice,
though this is by no means a unique choice. From ε0 one may deﬁne a pure waveguide
contribution Dw to the dispersion parameter by the deﬁnition

Dw =

∂λ∂ω

where β0(ω) is the solution to the wave equation with ε(~r⊥, ω) = ε0(~r⊥, ˜ω), i.e. the
frequency dependence of the dielectric function is ignored. Furthermore, this has the
consequence that the wave equation, Eq. (1), becomes scale invariant which is very
convenient from a numerical point of view since results for one characteristic length
scale can easily be scaled to a diﬀerent length scale.

For the dielectric material itself one likewise deﬁnes a material dispersion Dm
m(ω). From the simple

homogeneous-space dispersion relation it readily follows that

Dm = −

D ≈ Dw + Dm

Intuitively, one might speculate that the two kinds of sources of dispersion simply add
up and actually the approximation

is used widely in the literature. While the approximation is useful in qualitatively
understanding the zero-dispersion properties it is however also clear (see e.g. the work
of Ferrando et al. [17]) that quantitative correct results requires either a self-consistent
solution of the wave equation or some accurate perturbative method [18, 19].

In this paper we use a fully self-consistent solution of the wave equation, Eq. (1).
For the dielectric function we use the frequency-independent value ε = 1 in the air-
hole regions while we for silica employ the usual three-term Sellmeier polynomial
description,

Figure 2 illustrates the typical dispersion properties of a photonic crystal ﬁbre.
The strongly negative material dispersion Dm of silica below λ ∼ 1.3 µm tend to make
the total dispersion D of standard ﬁbres negative for λ . 1.3 µm, simply because of the
very weak waveguide contribution Dw. However, photonic crystal ﬁbres are contrary
to this since the composite air-silica cladding is seen to provide the guided mode with
a strongly positive waveguide dispersion Dw which tends to shift the zero-dispersion
wavelength λ0 far below 1.3 µm towards the visible. While the material dispersion is
ﬁxed the waveguide dispersion varies strongly in the phase-space spanned by d and Λ
and in this way the competition between waveguide and material dispersion becomes
a powerful mechanism in engineering the zero-dispersion wavelength.

3. A strand of silica in air — the ultimate limit?

As mentioned in the introduction the zero-dispersion wavelength may be pushed to
lower values by simply increasing the air hole diameter and decreasing the pitch.
For d/Λ → 1 this will to some extend eﬀectively leave us with a single strand of silica
surrounded by air. This limiting case has been emphasized previously in the literature
and in Fig. 3 we reproduce the zero-dispersion wavelength results reported by Knight
et al. [15]. Generally, the strand of silica will have either two dispersion zeros or none,
with the exception of the special case where it only supports a single dispersion zero.
PCFs turn out to follow the same overall pattern and the existence of two dispersion
zeros turns out to have interesting applications in super-continuum generation [20].

The results in Fig. 3 leave promises for a zero-dispersion wavelength down to
below 500 nm which will eventually also be the ultimate limit for silica based PCFs.
However, as also indicated by the dashed line the large index contrast between air and
silica in general prevents single-mode operation at the zero-dispersion wavelength. In
the following we will study to which degree the photonic crystal cladding concept of
PCFs can be used to circumvent this problem.

4. Photonic crystal cladding as a modal sieve

As demonstrated already by Birks et al. [13] the photonic crystal cladding of a PCF
acts as modal sieve which may prevent localization of high-order modes to the core
region. This so-called endlessly single-mode property has later been studied in great
detail [14, 21, 22, 23] and it was recently argued that the endlessly single-mode
phenomena is a pure geometrical eﬀect and that the PCF is endlessly single mode
for d/Λ . 0.42 irrespectively of the ﬁbre material refractive index [24]. The photonic
crystal cladding thus serves to limit the number of guided modes and at the same
time the guided modes will to some extend inherit the chromatic dispersion properties
observed for the strand of silica in air [15].

The problem of zero-dispersion wavelength versus pitch has previously been
studied for PCFs with an inﬁnite photonic crystal cladding [19] demonstrating curves
qualitatively resembling the curve in Fig. 3. Here, we extend that work to PCFs with
a photonic crystal cladding of ﬁnite spatial extent. In particular, we study the eﬀect
of a varying number N of rings of air holes surrounding the core region. We also
study the cut-oﬀ and leakage properties to explore the possibility for a single-mode
PCF with a zero-dispersion wavelength in the visible.

Our numerical solutions of the wave equation, Eq. (1), are based on a ﬁnite-
element approach which is described in detail in Ref. [25]. For the calculation of the
cut-oﬀ wavelength and the leakage loss we refer to Refs. [26, 27] and references therein.
The results of extensive numerical simulations are summarized in Fig. 4. First
of all we notice that the zero-dispersion wavelength versus pitch has a curve-shape
qualitatively resembling the result in Fig. 3 for a strand of silica in air. Furthermore,
we see that the number N of rings of air holes has little inﬂuence on the zero-dispersion
wavelength. In particular, the results for N = 10 are in full quantitative agreement
with those reported in Ref. [19]. On the other hand, the spatial extent N × Λ of the
photonic crystal cladding is as expected seen to have a huge impact on the leakage
loss [28, 27] as seen from the red shading indicating the region with a leakage loss
exceeding 0.1 dB/km. Furthermore, N has as expected little eﬀect on the cut-oﬀ
wavelength since the cut-oﬀ and the modal sieving is governed by the width (Λ − d)
of the silica regions between the air holes [24] rather than the spatial extent N × Λ of
the photonic crystal cladding.

Finally, we note that by choosing d/Λ ∼ 0.7 we may realize a PCF with a single
zero-dispersion wavelength down to ∼ 700 nm with the ﬁbre being single-mode for
longer wavelengths. We believe this to be the ultimate limit for silica-based PCFs
having a photonic crystal cladding comprising a triangular arrangement of circular air
holes. Such results have been demonstrated experimentally by e.g. Knight et al. [15].
In practice, the limit might be pushed slightly further toward the visible since real
PCFs tend to have a slightly shorter cut-oﬀ wavelength compared to the expectations
based on the ideal ﬁbre structure [23]. Most likely, this tendency originates in the
presence of scattering loss in real ﬁbres which also acts in suppressing the high-

order modes even though they are weakly guided by the photonic crystal cladding.
In order to push the zero-dispersion wavelength further into the visible one would
have to tolerate guidance of high-order modes or alternatively employ somewhat more
complicated designs involving a varying air-hole diameter throughout the cladding [29].

5. Conclusion

In conclusion we have studied the zero-dispersion wavelength λ0 in silica based
photonic crystal ﬁbres with special emphasis on the interplay with the cut-oﬀ
wavelength and leakage loss. In the large parameter space spanned by the air-hole
diameter d and the pitch Λ we have identiﬁed the values facilitating the shortest
possible zero-dispersion wavelength (∼ 700 nm) while the ﬁbre is still single-mode for
longer wavelengths.

We believe that our λ0-maps are an important input for the eﬀorts in designing
nonlinear photonic crystal ﬁbres with still shorter zero-dispersion wavelengths for
super-continuum generation in the visible.

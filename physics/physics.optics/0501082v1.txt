Theory of short-wavelength dispersion and modal properties of photonic crystal ﬁbers

We consider photonic crystal ﬁbers made from arbitrary base materials and derive a uniﬁed semi-
analytical theory for the dispersion and modal properties which applies to the short-wavelength
regime. In particular we calculate the dispersion and the eﬀective index and comparing to fully-
vectorial plane wave simulations we ﬁnd excellent agreement. We also calculate asymptotic results
for the mode-ﬁeld diameter and the V -parameter and from the latter we predict that the ﬁbers are
endlessly single mode for a normalized air-hole diameter smaller than 0.42, independently of the
base material.

Photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCF) are dielectric optical
ﬁbers with an array of air holes running along the full
length of the ﬁber. Typically, the ﬁbers employ a
single dielectric base material (with dielectric function
εb = n2
b ) and historically silica has been the most com-
mon choice.[1, 2] Recently other base materials have
been studied including chalcogenide glass,[3] lead sili-
cate glass,[4] telluride glass,[5] bismuth glass,[6] silver
halide,[7] teﬂon,[8] and plastics/polymers.[9] The, fab-
ricated ﬁbers typically share the same overall geometry
with the air holes arranged in a triangular lattice and the
core defect being formed by the removal of a single air-
hole. There has been a major theoretical and numerical
eﬀort to understand the dispersion and modal proper-
ties of especially silica-based PCFs, but since the scale-
invariance of Maxwell’s equations[10] cannot be applied
directly to generalize the results to other base materials.
The reason is that PCFs made from diﬀerent base mate-
rials do not relate to each other by a linear scaling of the
dielectric function, ε(r) 9 s2ε(r). The increased focus
on use of new base materials thus calls for a theory of
PCFs with an arbitrary base material.

This Letter oﬀers a uniﬁed approach to the dispersion
properties which utilizes that the base material typically
have a dielectric function exceeding that of air signiﬁ-
cantly, εb ≫ 1.
In that case it is well-known that the
short-wavelength regime is characterized by having the
majority of the electrical ﬁeld residing in the high-index
base material while the fraction of electrical ﬁeld in the
air holes is vanishing. The calculation starts from the
fully-vectorial wave-equation for the electrical ﬁeld,[10]

∇ × ∇ × E(r) = ε(r)

E(r).

(1)

ω2
c2

For a ﬁber geometry with z along the ﬁber axis we have
ε(r) = ε(x, y) and we look for solutions of the plane-wave
form ei(βz−ωt) with the goal of calculating the dispersion
ω(β) relation. The above discussion for εb ≫ 1 suggests
that we can approximate the problem by imposing the
boundary condition that E is zero at the interfaces to
air. Since the displacement ﬁeld D = εE is divergence
free we have 0 = ε∇ · E + E · ∇ε ≈ ε∇ · E and the wave
equation now reduces to

−∇2E(r) ≈ εb

E(r).

(2)

ω2
c2

At this point we note that a similar scalar treatment has
recently been applied successfully to PCFs in the short-
wavelength regime.
[11] While that approach took the
electrical ﬁeld in the air holes into account we shall here
solve Eq. (2) with the boundary condition that E is zero
at the interfaces to air. Obviously, the scalar problem
posed by Eq. (2) is separable and formally we have that

c
nb

p

ω =

Ω2

xy + Ω2

z =

γ2Λ−2 + β2

(3)

q

where Ωz = cβ/nb is the frequency associated with the
longitudinal plane-wave propagation, Ωxy = γ × cΛ−1/nb
is the frequency associated with the transverse conﬁne-
ment/localization, and γ is a corresponding dimension-
less and purely geometrical number, which only depends
on the normalized air-hole diameter d/Λ. From Eq. (2)
it follows that γ is an eigenvalue governed by a scalar
two-dimensional Schr¨odinger-like equation
x + ∂2

y )ψ(x, y) = γ2ψ(x, y),

−Λ2(∂2

(4)

with the scalar function ψ being subject to hard-wall
boundary conditions at the interfaces to the air-holes,
i.e. ψ = 0 in the air holes.

The developments in computational physics and engi-
neering have turned numerical solutions of partial diﬀer-
ential equations in the direction of a standard task. Here,
we employ a ﬁnite-element approach[12] to numerically
solve Eq. (4) and calculate γ2 versus d/Λ. Panel (A) in
Fig. 1 summarizes the results for the fundamental core
mode (see inset in Fig. 2) and the fundamental cladding
mode (see inset in Fig. 3). As the normalized air-hole di-
ameter d/Λ is increased the conﬁnement becomes more
tight and as expected the eigenvalue increases. For the
fundamental core mode the dashed line shows a third-
order polynomial,

With Eqs. (3) and (5) at hand we have now provided
a uniﬁed theory of the dispersion relation in the short-
wavelength regime for PCFs with arbitrary base materi-
als and Eq. (3) illustrates how geometrical conﬁnement
modiﬁes the linear free-space dispersion relation.

In ﬁber optics it is common to express the dispersion
properties in terms of the eﬀective index neﬀ = cβ/ω ver-
sus the free-space wavelength λ = c2π/ω. From Eq. (3)
it follows straightforwardly that

which obviously is in qualitative agreement with the ac-
cepted view that neﬀ increases monotonously with de-
creasing wavelength and approaches nb in the asymptotic
short-wavelength limit as reported for e.g. silica-based
PCFs.[2] However, how good is the quantitative agree-
ment for diﬀerent base materials? In Figs. 2 and 3 we
employ fully-vectorial plane-wave simulations[16] to com-
pare Eq. (1) with the predictions of Eq. (8) for the fun-
damental core and cladding modes, respectively. As seen
there is an over-all good agreement between the fully-
vectorial numerical results from Eq. (1) and the semi-
analytical predictions of Eq. (8). In the short-wavelength
limit λ ≪ Λ the agreement is excellent, which underlines
the high relevance of the present results to large-mode

V -parameter, and Panel (C) the eﬀective mode-ﬁeld radius of
the fundamental core mode. The data-points are obtained
from ﬁnite-element simulations[12] of Eq. (4) and the dashed
lines are guides to the eyes. The gray region indicates the
endlessly single-mode regime with VPCF < π.

and the numerical results shown in Panel (B) agrees
nicely with the short-wavelength asymptotic limit of re-
cent simulations on silica-based PCFs.[14] The endlessly
single-mode regime,[2] deﬁned by VPCF < π,[13] exists for
d/Λ . 0.42 independently of the base material. Panel(C)
shows results for the eﬀective mode-ﬁeld radius[15] weﬀ

becomes more localized. For VPCF = π we ﬁnd that

comes comparable to the pitch Λ the quantitative agree-
ment is less good. The reason is well-known from highly
non-linear silica-based PCFs where a non-negligible frac-
tion of the electrical ﬁeld is forced to reside in the air-hole
regions and where also vectorial eﬀects of Eq. (1) start
to matter.

In conclusion we have shown how a uniﬁed descrip-
tion of the short-wavelength dispersion and modal prop-
erties is possible. The theory illustrates how the waveg-
uide dispersion originates from the geometrical trans-
verse conﬁnement/localization of the mode and the semi-
analytical description of the short-wavelength properties
is readily applied to PCFs made from any base material.

The quality factors of modes in nearly identical GaAs and Al0.18Ga0.82As microdisks are tracked
over three wavelength ranges centered at 980 nm, 1460 nm, and 1600 nm, with Q-values measured as
high as 6.62×105 in the 1600-nm band. After accounting for surface scattering, the remaining loss
is due to sub-bandgap absorption in the bulk and on the surfaces. We observe the absorption is, on
average, 80 percent greater in AlGaAs than in GaAs and in both materials is 540 percent higher at
980 nm than at 1600 nm.

In recent semiconductor cavity QED experiments in-
volving self-assembled III-V quantum dots (QDs), Rabi
splitting of the spontaneous emission line from indi-
vidual QD excitonic states has been measured for the
ﬁrst time [1, 2, 3]. Potential application of these de-
vices to quantum networks [4] and cryptography [5] over
long-haul silica ﬁbers has sparked interest in developing
QD-cavity systems with eﬃcient light extraction oper-
ating in the telecommunication bands at 1300 nm and
1550 nm [6]. The demonstration of vacuum-Rabi split-
ting in this system, a result of coupling a QD to local-
ized optical modes of a surrounding microresonator, has
been greatly aided by prior improvements to the design
and fabrication of semiconductor microcavities [7, 8]. At
the shorter wavelengths involved in these Rabi splitting
experiments (740–1200 nm), the optical quality factors
of the host AlGaAs microcavities were limited to Q
≈
104—corresponding to a loss rate comparable with the
2
coherent QD-cavity coupling rate. Further reduction of
optical loss would increase the relative coherence of the
QD-cavity system and would allow greater coupling eﬃ-
ciency to the cavity mode.

In previous measurements of wavelength-scale AlGaAs
microdisk resonators, we have demonstrated Q-factors
105 in the 1400-nm band [9] and attributed
up to 3.6
the improved performance to an optimized resist-reﬂow
and dry-etching technique, which produces very smooth
sidewalls [10].
Subsequently, we have also measured
Al0.3Ga0.7As microdisks with similar quality factors be-
tween 1200 nm and 1500 nm; however, these disks exhibit
a signiﬁcant unexpected decrease in Q at shorter wave-
lengths (λo
In related work on silicon
microdisks, methods have been developed to speciﬁcally
measure and characterize losses due to material absorp-
tion and surface scattering [10, 12, 13].
In this Let-
ter we study the properties of GaAs and Al0.18Ga0.82As
microdisks across three wavelength bands centered at
980 nm, 1460 nm, and 1600 nm. After estimating and
removing the surface-scattering contribution to the cav-
ities losses, we ﬁnd the remaining absorption, composed
of losses in the bulk and on the surfaces, depends signif-

icantly on both wavelength and material composition.

Within the microdisk resonators studied here, optical
loss can be separated into three main components: intrin-
sic radiation of the whispering-gallery modes (WGMs),
scattering from roughness at the air-dielectric interface
due to fabrication imperfections, and absorption at the
surface or in the bulk of the semiconductor material. The
measured total intrinsic Qi is given by

1/Qi = 1/Qrad + 1/Qss + 1/Qa,

(1)

where Qrad, Qss, and Qa describe cavity losses to radia-
tion, surface scattering, and absorption, respectively. For
proper values of the thickness and diameter, microdisk
cavities support a large number of modes with very low
106
radiation loss; for all the modes studied here Qrad is
and typically is

108.

The samples were fabricated from high-quality het-
erostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a
GaAs substrate. Two diﬀerent samples were grown: a
“GaAs” sample containing a 247-nm GaAs disk layer,
and an “AlGaAs” sample with a 237-nm Al0.18Ga0.82As
disk layer.
In both samples the disk layer was grown
nominally undoped (background doping levels np .
1015 cm−3) and was deposited on a 1.6-µm Al0.7Ga0.3As
3.4 µm
sacriﬁcial layer. Microdisks with a radius of
were deﬁned by electron-beam lithography and etched in
a 55 percent (by volume) HBr solution containing 3.6 g of
K2Cr2O7 per litre [14]. The disks were partially under-
cut by etching the sacriﬁcial layer in 8 percent HF acid
for 45 s, prior to e-beam resist removal.

∼

Passive measurements of the cavity Qi were performed
using an evanescent coupling technique employing a dim-
pled ﬁber-taper waveguide [12, 15, 16]. The dimpled ta-
per was mounted to a three-axis 50-nm-encoded stage
and positioned in the near ﬁeld of the resonator. Using
the taper position to vary the coupling, the WGMs of
the microdisks were excited using three swept tunable
laser sources (linewidth < 5 MHz, covering 963–993 nm,
1423–1496 nm, and 1565–1625 nm). By weakly loading
the cavity, the resonance linewidth [see Fig. 1(b)] is a
good measure for the intrinsic quality factor (Qi = λo/δλ

2

The measured Qis for all observed modes are summa-
rized in Fig. 2(a). Modes with Qis dominated by radia-
tion loss, i.e. the measured Qi is near Qrad calculated us-
ing FEM simulations, are omitted. In the 1600-nm band,
the high-Q TE modes are p = 1–4 in GaAs and p = 1–3
in AlGaAs; all TM modes are radiation limited in this
band. Near 1460 nm, the TEp=1−4 and TMp=1 modes in
both materials are detectable and not radiation limited.
In the 980-nm range, identifying modes becomes more
diﬃcult: at this wavelength families through TEp=8 and
TMp=7 are not radiation limited, and signiﬁcant spectral
overlap between the modes causes Fano-like resonance

because they are poorly phase matched to the ﬁber taper.
Despite eﬀorts to produce perfectly smooth side walls,
Figs. 1(c,d) indicate that signiﬁcant surface roughness is
still present. Surface roughness on microdisk resonators
backscatters light between the degenerate WGMs, which
breaks their degeneracy and results in the measured
mode-splitting (∆λ) shown in Fig. 1(b). Following the
theory developed in Refs. [10] and [18], ∆λ and Qss are
both dependent on the characteristic volume of the scat-
terer (Vs):

We employ two separate measurements to ﬁnd rough
bounds on Qss. First, we use the average doublet split-
ting for each family to ﬁnd the average

by each mode and then calculate the Qss associated with
each family.

Second, we statistically analyze the roughness of the disk
edges in high resolution SEM images [12]. Fitting the au-
tocorrelation of the roughness to a Gaussian, the rough-
ness amplitude (σr) and correlation length (Lc) give the
“statistical” scatterer volume (V s = σrt√RLc where t
and R are the disk’s thickness and radius) for each disk,

each mode will not sample all of the disk’s physical ir-
regularities, the roughness estimated by the statistical
analysis is slightly greater than the roughness calculated
from the doublet splittings. Hence, the doublet splitting
places an upper bound and more accurate value for Qss
[Fig. 2(c)]. The statistical analysis gives a lower bound,
although neither bound is strict in the theoretical sense.
Through Eq. (1), Qss and Qrad are removed from the
measured Qi to obtain limits on Qa [Fig. 2(d)]. To
relate cavity losses to material properties, the mate-
rial absorption rate (γa,p) for the pth mode is given by
γa,p = 2πc/λoQa [23]. We weight each measured dou-
blet equally and average over all families in a band to
determine an average γa. Table I compiles the aver-
age absorption rates for both GaAs and Al0.18Ga0.82As
across the three wavelength ranges. The average rates
are 540 percent larger at 980 nm than at 1600 nm and
80 percent greater in AlGaAs than in GaAs.

The measured absorption may be due to a number
of sources. Although nonlinear-absorption-induced op-
tical bistability was measured for internal cavity energies
as low as 360 aJ, the losses reported in Table I were all
taken at input powers well below the nonlinear absorp-
tion threshold. Free carrier and Urbach tail absorption
can also be neglected given the nominally undoped mate-
rial and the relatively long wavelengths studied here [19].
This leaves deep electron (hole) traps as the likely source
contributing to bulk material absorption in the measured
microdisks. Similar wavelength dependent absorption
has been observed in photocurrent measurements of MBE
grown AlGaAs waveguides [20] and attributed to sub-
bandgap trap levels associated with vacancy complexes

and oxygen incorporation during growth [21]. Given the
high surface-volume ratio of the microdisks, another pos-
sible source of loss is surface-state absorption. The sensi-
tivity to absorption from surface-states can be quantiﬁed
by the pth mode’s energy overlap with the disk’s sur-
face, Γ′
p; TM modes are more surface-sensitive than TE
modes [13] whereas both polarizations are almost equally
sensitive to the bulk. The calculated surface overlap ratio
is Γ′
2.65 for p = 1 modes in the 1460-nm band,
where all surfaces of the disk (top, bottom, and etched
edge) are treated equally. For these modes the measured

In summary, after accounting for radiation and sur-
face scattering losses, we measure greater sub-bandgap
absorption in Al0.18Ga0.82As microdisks than in similar
GaAs resonators, and the absorption in both materials
decreases towards longer wavelengths. From the polar-
ization dependence of the measured optical loss, we in-
fer that both surface states and bulk states contribute
to the residual absorption in these structures. Our re-
sults imply that reductions in the optical loss of AlGaAs-
based microphotonics, especially at the shorter wave-
lengths < 1 µm and in high Al content alloys, will require
further study and reduction of deep level traps, and that
surface passivation techniques [22] will also likely be im-
portant.

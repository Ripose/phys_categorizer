Abstract

The second-harmonic interferometric spectroscopy (SHIS) which combines both am-

plitude (intensity) and phase spectra of the second-harmonic (SH) radiation is pro-

posed as a new spectroscopic technique being sensitive to the type of critical points

(CP’s) of combined density of states at semiconductor surfaces. The increased sensi-

tivity of SHIS technique is demonstrated for the buried Si(111)-SiO2 interface for SH

photon energies from 3.6 eV to 5 eV and allows to separate the resonant contributions

from E′

0/E1, E2 and E′

1 CP’s of silicon.

Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is inherently sensitive to surface and interface prop-

erties of centrosymmetric materials. Recently, the spectroscopy of the second-harmonic (SH)

intensity has been proved as a promising probe of surfaces and interfacial layers1 and inten-

sively employed in numerous works for oxidized2, reconstructed3 and H-terminated4 silicon

surfaces. The resonances of the SH intensity are attributed in these cases to direct interband

electron transitions. By analogy with the spectrum of the linear dielectric function ε(ω) the

spectrum of the quadratic susceptibility χ(2)(2ω) of such semiconductor surfaces could be

expressed as the superposition of several van Hove singularities (critical points (CP’s) of

the combined density of states) χ(2)

m (2ω) ∝ (2ω − ωm + iΓm)n with threshold frequencies

ωm and broadenings Γm

5. The exponent n reﬂects the dimensionality of CP: n = 1/2, 0

1

(logarithmic),−1/2, −1 for 3D, 2D, 1D and excitonic CP, respectively. Although the line

shapes χ(2)(2ω) are quite diﬀerent for various n, in most cases a large number of adjustable

parameters makes the determination of the type of CP solely from the SH intensity spectrum

doubtful, and most of authors interpret the SHG spectroscopy data within excitonic CP line

shape6.

The single-beam SH interferometry traces back to the mid-1960s8 and is conventionally

used for the determination of the phase of the quadratic susceptibility of adsorbate molecules

and their absolute direction9 and for separation of the SH contributions from thin ﬁlms and

their substrates10. Another use of SH phase measurements is a homodyne mixing technique

to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for surface SHG probe11. The use of external12 and

internal13 homodynes for dc or low-frequency modulated electric-ﬁeld-induced SHG allows

to measure the in-plane spatial distribution of the electric ﬁeld vector with micron resolution

or to visualize weak nonlinear contributions. Further developments of the SH interferometry

are the frequency-domain interferometric SH spectroscopy14 exploring the broad bandwidth

of femtosecond laser pulses, and the hyper-Rayleigh scattering interferometry15 using the

correlation of ﬂuctuations in linear and nonlinear optical properties of thin inhomogeneous

ﬁlms.

In this Letter, a modiﬁcation of the SH spectroscopy - the SH interferometric spec-

troscopy (SHIS) which combines both amplitude (intensity) SH spectroscopy and SH inter-

ferometry is proposed. The combination of the phase and amplitude SH spectra, extracted

from the SHIS data, is shown to be sensitive to type of CP even for systems with interfering

SH contributions from close electronic resonances. Additionally SHIS allows to avoid the

sign uncertainty of Re(χ(2)) inherent in the conventional spectroscopy of the SHG inten-

sity. The spectral dependence of the phase and amplitude of the SH waves from the buried

Si(111)-SiO2 interface is measured using the SHIS technique in the spectral range in the

vicinity of silicon E2 CP. In contrast to E′

0/E1 CP revealing the excitonic type, the family of

E2 CP’s of the bulk silicon demonstrates the 2D type in linear response7. The resonant con-

tributions to the quadratic susceptibility from E′

0/E1, E2 and E′

1 silicon CP’s are extracted

2

within the simple phenomenological model which accounts the complex Green’s function

corrections for the SH wave generation.

The scheme of the SHIS setup is shown in Fig.1(a). The p-polarized output of a tunable

nanosecond parametric generator/ampliﬁer laser system (Spectra-Physics MOPO 710) op-

erating in the interval of 490 - 690 nm is focused onto the sample at an angle of incidence

of 45◦. The SH signal is detected by a monochromator, a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and

an electronic peak-hold detector. To normalize the SH intensity spectrum over the laser

ﬂuence and the spectral sensitivity of the optical detection system a SHG intensity reference

channel is used with a slightly wedged z-cut quartz plate and with the detection system

identical to the one in the sample channel. The (phase-)reference sample is chosen (i) to

be thin enough to avoid Maker fringes in the SH response during tuning the fundamental

wavelength λω, (ii) to be optical inactive for conservation the polarization state of the fun-

damental radiation while transmitting through it, (iii) to have no resonance features in the

tuning region of both the fundamental and SH waves. Therefore the 1 mm-thick plate of

fused quartz coated with a 30 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlm is chosen as a reference.

The SH interferogram is obtained by translating the reference along the fundamental laser

beam varying the distance l between the reference and the sample. The SH signals from the

reference, I 2ω

r , and from the sample, I 2ω

s , are monitored separately by inserting appropriate

ﬁlters (yellow or UV, respectively) between the reference and the sample. I 2ω
r

is adjusted

with the angle of incidence of the fundamental beam at the ITO phase reference. The de-

tected SH intensity I 2ω is the result of interference of the SH waves from the reference, E2ω
r ,

and from the sample, E2ω
s :

(1)

where L = λω(2∆n)−1 is the period of SH interferogram with ∆n = n2ω − nω describing

the air dispersion, and α < 1 indicates the laser coherence. The position-dependent phase

shift 2πl/L between E2ω

r and E2ω

s

comes from the diﬀerent refractive indices of air for the

fundamental and SH waves. The spectral dependences of χ(2) of the reference and the

3

sample as well as the complex Green’s function corrections for the SH wave produce a

position-independent phase shift Φrs(λω, λ2ω). The dependence I 2ω

r (l) is described by the

conventional formula for focused Gaussian beams. The spectrum of the phase of the SH wave

from the ITO ﬁlm, Φr ≡ Arg(E2ω

r ), is measured using the 1 mm-thick backside-immersed

y-cut quartz as a sample since the phase of the SH wave from the quartz surface is spectrally

independent in the whole used spectral region. The Φr spectrum of the ITO ﬁlm appears to

be a constant within the error bars and I 2ω

r gradually increases with decreasing λω without

any resonance features.

The samples are natively oxidized p-doped Si(111) wafers with resistivity of 10Ω · cm.

SHIS has been performed at the maximum of the azimuthal SH rotational anisotropy for

the p-in, p-out polarization combination of the fundamental and SH waves. Figure 1(b)

shows typical SH interference patterns measured for diﬀerent λω. The spectral dependence

of the period L due to the air dispersion and clear changes in the contrast of the patterns

due to the distance dependence of I 2ω
r

in the focused laser beam are seen. The ﬁt of the

set of SH interference patterns by Eq.(1) with Φrs, I 2ω

s , L, and α as adjustable parameters

leads to the spectra of Φrs, I 2ω
s

and L shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) and in the inset of

Fig. 1, respectively. To emphasize the spectral features of I 2ω

s (2ω), we combine the ﬁtted

intensity spectrum with the I 2ω

s (2ω) dependence measured directly with a ﬁne resolution in

SH photon energy. Φrs increases approximately by 1.2 radians within the interval of 4.2-4.6

eV and decreases outside this energy region. A small, but reliable, non-monotonic feature

is seen at 3.8 - 4.0 eV. The I 2ω
s

spectrum has pronounced peaks centered approximately at

3.9 eV and 4.3 eV. The position of the 4.3 eV resonance is close to E2 CP and we associate

the observed features of SH phase and intensity spectra for energies between 4.1 and 4.6 eV

with direct interband electron transitions at E2 CP of Si7.

The relative phase Φrs measured in SHIS is given by:

Φrs = Φs − (Φr + Arg(R2ω)),

(2)

where R2ω is the Fresnel reﬂection factor of the p-polarized SH radiation from the Si-SiO2

4

interface. The phase Φs ≡ Arg(E2ω

s ) originates from both complex surface χ(2),S and bulk

quadrupole χ(2),BQ quadratic susceptibilities as well as from Green’s function corrections16:

E2ω

s = Gkχ(2)

k + G⊥χ(2)
⊥ ,

(3)

where Gk and G⊥ are the Green’s function corrections for the generation and the propagation

of in-plane and normal components of E2ω

s , and χ(2)

k and χ(2)

⊥ are the corresponding eﬀective

components of χ(2). χ(2)

k and χ(2)

⊥ are the linear combinations of χ(2),S and χ(2),BQ components

with nonresonant coeﬃcients depending only on the fundamental wavevector and taking

into account the geometry of the nonlinear interaction. This allows to consider the spectral

dependences of χ(2)

k and χ(2)

⊥ as a superposition of two-photon resonances for diﬀerent CP’s:

χ(2)

α (2ω) = B −Xm

f α
m exp(iφα

m)(2ω − ωm + iΓm)n,

(4)

where α =⊥, k, and m numerates the CP resonances. The oscillator strengths f α

m are

supposed to be real numbers. For the sake of simplicity, a slight spectral dependence of the

term B including the Si resonances with threshold energies below 1.5 eV3 is neglected, and

φα

m are integer multiples of π/2 deﬁning the type of CP. The solid lines in Fig.2 show the ﬁt

of Φrs and I 2ω
s

spectra by Eq.(2) and |E2ω

s |2 from Eq.(3), respectively, with the Si dispersion

data from Ref.[17] and expressions for Gk and G⊥ from Ref.[18]. Five resonant contributions

are included into the ﬁt. The ﬁrst resonance, centered at ω1 = 3.45 eV, has excitonic

line shape (n = −1, φ1 = 0) and corresponds to the direct electron transitions at E′

0/E1

CP. The second resonance at 3.97 eV with 1D maximum line shape (n = −1/2, φ2 = 0)

has no equivalent in the band structure of crystalline bulk silicon. However, a resonance

in the close energy interval has been recently observed at the Si(001)-SiO2 interface6 and

could be associated with transition in Si atoms located at the interface with reduced lattice

symmetry. The strong resonant features in the vicinity of 4.3 eV are formed by interference of

two resonances centered at ω3 = 4.12 eV and at ω4 = 4.34 eV with almost equal amplitudes

(f4 ≈ 0.9f3). It is mostly reasonable to attribute these peaks to transitions at E2(X) and

E2(Σ) CP’s. These resonances are ﬁtted with 2D minimum (φ3 = 0) and 2D maximum

5

(φ4 = π) line shapes (χ(2)

m ∝ ln(2ω − ωm + iΓm)) by analogy with the linear case7. Note,

that ω3 and ω4 are approximately 0.1 eV red-shifted from resonances of linear χ(1). This

allows to interpret also 4.12 eV-resonance as a contribution from E0 CP, which is normally

very weak in the linear response. The best representation of the data is obtained with a

2D minimum line shape of the last resonance, centered at 5.15 eV, which can be associated

with electron transitions located near E′

1 CP7. The error bars for the central frequencies are

approximately 0.03 eV and mostly attributed to the relative weight of χ(2)

k and χ(2)

⊥ being

unresolvable from our data. Excitonic line shapes for all resonances (dotted lines in Fig.2)

ﬁt the I 2ω
s

spectrum with almost the same quality as the CP model, but ﬁt the Φrs spectrum

obviously worse.

Summarizing, the general scheme of the second-harmonic interferometric spectroscopy is

presented. The phase and amplitude of the SH wave from the buried Si(111)-SiO2 interface

are measured simultaneously using the SHIS technique in the interval of SH photon energies

from 3.6 eV to 5 eV. The contributions of interband transitions located at E′

0/E1, E2 and

E′

1 Si critical points are separated and sensitivity of SHIS to CP line shapes is shown.

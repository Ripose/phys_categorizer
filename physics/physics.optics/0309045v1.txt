Mode Competition in Gas and Semiconductor Lasers

Abstract

The output spectrum of both gas and semiconductor lasers usually contains more
than one frequency. Multimode operation in gas versus semiconductor lasers arises
from diﬀerent physics. In gas lasers, slow equilibration of the electron populations at
diﬀerent energies makes each frequency an independent single-mode laser. The slow
electron diﬀusion in semiconductor lasers, combined with the spatially varying optical
intensity patterns of the modes, makes each region of space an independent single-mode
laser. We develop a rate equation model for the photon number in each mode which
captures all these eﬀects. Plotting the photon number versus pumping rate for the
competing modes, in both subthreshold and above threshold operation, illustrates the
changes in the laser output spectrum due to either slow equilibration or slow diﬀusion
of electrons.

1 Introduction

The basic physics of mode competition in gas and semiconductor lasers has been known
since the 1960’s [1]- [4]. When the laser medium is in quasi-equilibrium and spatial variations
in the mode patterns can be neglected, only a single frequency appears in the laser output.
A rate equation model developed by Siegman [2, 3] describes the subthreshold, transition,
and lasing regions of operation for a single mode laser. Quantum theories of a single mode
laser [5] give similar (if not idential) results for the laser output power versus pumping rate
as the simpler semiclassical models.

Figure 1: A four level lasing system representing both gas and semiconductor lasers. A
current I pumps electrons from a lower thermodynamic reservoir (L) into an upper electron
bath (U). Currents IA (IB) then transfer electrons into the upper level of transition A
(B). An electron electron scattering rate sAB (sBA) from the upper levels of transition A to
transition B (B to A) is also present in this model. The upper lasing levels has occupation
factor fA (fB), while the occupation factor of the lower lasing level is assumed to be ˜fA = 0
( ˜fB = 0).

In this paper we extend the rate equation models for a single model laser [2, 3] to include
mode competition in both gas and semiconductor lasers. For the gas laser we develop a set
of coupled rate equations which allow electron scattering between the lasing levels. The slow
electron scattering rate in gas lasers allows the electron occupation factors in the diﬀerent
lasing levels to get out of equilibrium with each other, producing multiple frequencies in the
laser output. In semiconductor lasers electron scattering between the diﬀerent energy levels
is rapid, keeping the occupation factors in the diﬀerent lasing levels in equilibrium with
each other. But spatial variation in the optical mode intensities inside the laser cavity favor
diﬀerent lasing modes in diﬀerent regions of space within the semiconductor. Following
Ref. [4] we extend the rate equations for a homogenous (semiconductor) line to allow for
spatially varying mode patterns, generating multiple frequencies in the laser output.

We assume both gas and semiconductor lasers are a four level system, with two intermedi-
ate lasing levels, as shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity we consider only two lasing modes, mode
A and mode B, with mode A the favored lasing mode. For the gas laser A and B represent
localized atomic states, while for the semiconductor A and B are spatially extended states
within the energy band of a quantum well. To simplify the mathematics we assume lower
lasing level is always empty, having occupation factors ˜fA = ˜fB = 0. In the language of gas
lasers this means we assume electrons in the lower lasing level empty very eﬃciently into an
electron bath (τA , τB → 0). In semiconductor language we would say there is extremely eﬃ-
cient hole capture into the quantum well. We therefore consider only pumping electrons into
the upper lasing level. In physical systems would also have to guarentee charge neutrality
while pumping the laser, and therefore also consider details of pumping and relaxation out
of the lower lasing level.

In this paper we limit consideration of laser mode competition to only 1-2 competing
modes. In actual lasers many modes compete, and this case has been considered by Casper-
son [6]. The rate equation models in this paper can be easily generalized to consider multiple
lasing modes.

2 Gas Lasers: Spectral Hole Burning

We construct the rate equations for an inhomogeneous line following the example of a
single mode laser from Refs. [2, 3]. We consider a scattering rate sA→B = sAB for electrons
from mode A to mode B. If we ﬁrstly neglect optical transitions, the rate equation for the
occupation probability fA for electrons in state A is

dfA
dt

= −fAsAB(1 − fB) + fBsBA(1 − fA) + IA.

Here IA is the pumping current per state. Specializing to thermodynamic equilibrium (no
pumping current) implies the rates sAB and sBA are related by a Boltzmann factor as

(1)

(2)

sAB = sBA exp (EA − EB)/kBT .

3

The rate equation for the photon number nA in mode A is unchanged from that for a single
mode laser

= KA(nA + 1)NA − γAnA.

(3)

dnA
dt

Here KA is an optical rate constant for the A transition, NA the number of A states (number
of atoms of type A in a gas laser), and γA the cavity escape rate for photons having frequency
ωA. Putting Eqs. (1)-(3) together (along with analogous equations for mode B) into a single
matrix equation for the variables fA, fB, nA, and nB gives

We now specialize to (EA − EB) ≪ kBT so that we can approximate sAB ≃ sBA = s.
As scattering rate s becomes large (s → ∞), the occupation factors fA and fB are forced to
equal each other (fA = fB) in this approximation. Without the approximation sAB ≃ sBA,
and in the absence of any optical transitions, we would have the occupation factors forced
towards a Fermi distribution f (E) having fA = f (EA) and fB = f (EB) as sAB → ∞.
The approximation sAB ≃ sBA therefore makes only a minor correction to the occupation
factors, and is therefore not essential for our analysis of mode competition. We therefore
approximate sAB ≃ sBA = s leading to

Inspection of the upper left quadrant of the matrix in Eq. (5) shows that the scattering
rate s is negligible until s exceeds one of the spontaneous emission rates AA or AB. Thus,
the transition from two independent lasers (s = 0) to a homogeneous line (s → ∞) occurs
when the scattering rate s exceeds the spontaneous emission rates AA and AB. This is true
in open cavity lasers with luminescence through the sides of the laser cavity, so that the
spontaneous emission rates AA and AB greatly exceed the cavity escape rates γA and γB.
If the cavity is closed, so that no side luminescence occurs, the spontaneous emission rates
are forced towards the cavity rates, i.e. AA → γA and AB → γB. In the case of a closed
cavity the transition from two independent lasers to a homogeneous line occurs when the
scattering rate s is comparable to the cavity rates γA and γB. Note that on a homogeneous

We have tried several diﬀerent types of initial guesses for fA, fB, nA, and nB to start the
iterative procedure, and the ﬁnal results seem to be independent of the diﬀerent initial
guesses. The initial guess which seems to converge in the shortest time is to start in the
subthreshold region and take for f i
A, and ni
B the analytical results for two independent
single mode lasers (s = 0). When incrementing to the next pumping rate, assume an initial
guess for fA, fB, nA, and nB which are just the converged values at the previous pumping
rate.

We use some results from the single mode laser [2, 3] to frame our discussion of two
coupled lasing modes. When the two laser modes are decoupled (s = 0), the threshold

emission rate of mode A (s = 1.0AA). Scattering forces the occupation factors fA and fB
towards each other, reducing the threshold current for mode A and increasing the threshold
current of mode B.

th = γAAA/NAKA and I B

currents for each mode are I A
th = γBAB/NBKB. The normalized
pumping rate r is deﬁned as r = IA/I A
th. We deﬁne the ratio of the two threshold currents
th/I A
when the modes are decoupled as z = I B
th. We assume the pumping current divides
equally among the two states so that IA = IB = I/2. The occupation factors above threshold
are ﬁxed at fA = f A

th = γB/NBKB due to gain saturation.

th = γA/NAKA and fB = f B

An important laser parameter is the number of luminescent modes p, where AA ≡ pKA.
For mode B this leaves the relation AB ≡ pzKB(γA/γB)(NB/NA). We further simplify by
taking N = NA = NB and γA = γB = γ. In the absence of mode coupling (s = 0), the
results for photon numbers versus normalized pumping rate r are then

2nA = p(r − 1) + p

(r − 1)2 + (4r/p)

and

2nB = p(r − z) + p

(r − z)2 + (4r/p).

Figures 2-4 show the photon numbers and occupation factors versus normalized pumping
rate r for diﬀerent scattering rates s. We choose p = 107 and z = 1.1 in Figs. 2-4.
In
Fig. 2 there is no scattering between states A and B (s = 0), leaving two independent single
mode lasers. Iterating Eq. (7) (solid lines) then just reproduce the analytical results from
Eqs. (8)-(9) (circles) in Fig. 2(a). The normalized occupation factors fA/f A
th in
Fig. 2 increase approximately linearly with pumping below threshold and saturate above the
lasing threshold.

th and fB/f A

As the scattering rate increases to s = 1.0AA in Fig. 3, and even further to s = 5.0AA
in Fig. 4, we see the lasing threshold for mode A shifts to a lower pumping current. The

threshold current for mode B continues to increase as the scattering rate s increases. The
increase in lasing threshold for mode B is much more pronounced than the decrease in
threshold current for mode A. Inspection of the occupation factors for the two decoupled

forces the two occupation factors towards each other. In Fig. 2(b) we have fB > fA in the
subthreshold region. Hence scattering between the modes will increase fA and decrease fB
in the subthreshold region as seen in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4(b). Scattering then lowers the
threshold current required for mode A to lase. Once mode A reaches the lasing threshold,
additional scattering between states A and B makes it more diﬃcult for mode B to raise its
occupation factor to fB = f B

chosen in Figs 2-4, additional scattering s lowers the threshold current for mode A. If the
occupation factors obey fB < fA in the subthreshold region, then the threshold current for
mode A increases with additional scattering s. When the pumping current divides equally
between the states A and B as we have assumed, the threshold current for mode A shifts
down with additional scattering s if (f B
th) > (f A
th), or, equivalently, if the spontaneous
rates obey AA > AB. Given our assumptions of γA = γB = γ and NA = NB = N, we require
KA > zKB for additional scattering s to lower the threshold current of mode A. Since we
choose z = 1.1 and KB = 0.75KA in Figs. 2-4 this condition is satisﬁed. Increasing z and/or
KB could reverse the inequality and raise the threshold current for mode A with increased
scattering s.
If the pumping current divides unequally as IA = αI and IB = (1 − α)I,
the requirement for additional scattering s to lower the threshold current of mode A is
(1 − α)AA > αAB. The threshold current required for mode B to lase will always increase

In the limit of s → ∞ we move towards a homogeneous line. Figure 5 shows the solution
of Eq. (5) with with s = 100AA. The photon number nB and occupation factor fB are
now essentially ﬁxed when mode A starts lasing due to gain saturation. Iteratively solving
Eq. (6) produces essentially the same graph as shown in Fig. 5. The homogeneous line shown
in Fig. 5 is the opposite limit of two independent laser lines shown in Fig. 2. Varying the
scattering rate s interpolates smoothly between the solutions in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5.

3 Semiconductor Lasers: Spatial Hole Burning

When there are spatial variations in the optical intensity in diﬀerent modes, two lasing
frequencies can coexist on a homogeneous line. Figure 6 shows the normalized optical mode
intensities |uA|2 and |uB|2 for the lowest two longitudinal modes in a cavity. Near the center
of the laser (region I), mode A is the favored lasing mode. However in region II, where the
optical intensity |uB|2 > |uA|2, mode B is the favored lasing mode. If the gain medium were
conﬁned to region I, only mode A would lase. Similarly, for the gain medium restricted to
region II, only mode B would lase. For semiconductor lasers the gain media ﬁlls the entire
laser cavity, so there is competition for the available optical gain between the lasing modes.
Whether or not a single or multiple frequencies appear in the laser output spectrum
depends on the size of the electron diﬀusion coeﬃcient D. For single frequency laser operation
to occur the electron must diﬀuse from region I to region II in Fig. 6 before the photon exits
the cavity. If the photon escapes the laser cavity before the electron can diﬀuse from region
I to region II, the regions are essentially independent as far as the laser light is concerned.
Optically, the laser behaves as if two independent (single mode) lasers operate inside the
cavity. The distance from region I to region II in Fig. 6 is approximately one quarter of
the lasing wavelength (λ/4). So for open cavity lasers we expect essentially single mode
operation whenever D ≫ (λ/4)2 ˜A. If the cavity is closed (no side luminescence) so that
˜A → γA, the condition for single mode laser operation becomes D ≫ (λ/4)2γA.

Figure 6: Competition between two lasing modes A and B is possible on a homogeneous
line when the optical mode intensities |uA|2 and |uB|2 vary in space. Mode A is favored in
region I, while in region II mode B is the favored lasing mode.

To describe semiconductor lasers quantitatively we need to generalize Eq. (4) to account

for the spatial variation in the mode patterns and electron density inside the laser. The
occupation factors in each mode will be spatially varying such that fA → fA(r) and fB →

is given

¯hωAnA(t)|uA(r)|2 = ǫ(r)|EA(r, t)|2,

where EA(r, t) is the electric ﬁeld of mode A and ǫ(r) the dielectric constant. Since we must
have

ǫ(r)|EA(r, t)|2dV = ¯hωAnA(t),

where the integration region L denotes the entire laser cavity, the mode functions uA(r) are
normalized as

|uA(r)|2dV = 1.

We can insert this factor of ’1’ from Eq. (15) wherever necessary in order to generalize Eq. (4)
to account for spatially varying electromagnetic ﬁelds.

Eqs. (16)-(17) can be used to construct a generalization of the coupled mode Eq. (4) to
account for spatial variations in the laser.

Our interest is in semiconductors with homogeneous optical lines, so we do not pursue the
full generalization of Eq. (4). We assume the scattering rate sAB → ∞ in the semiconductor,
so that we are back on a homogeneous optical line. We assume negligible separation of the
energy levels as before so that (EA − EB) ≪ kBT and s = sAB = sBA The occupation
factors we therefore take to be in equilibrium with each other at each point in space so that

for spatial variations while lasing on a homogeneous line. We simplify further by taking
the electron density of states to be constant in space so that the rate constants ˜KA(r),

competition between the longitudinal laser modes, though the same procedure would work

constant D = 0, letting us solve Eq. (19) for ρ and substitute back into Eqs. (20)-(21) leading

deﬁned the normalized pumping rate as r = R/RA

Figure 7: Photon numbers nA and nB versus normalized pumping rate r when the optical
mode intensities |uA|2 and |uB|2 are (a) constant in space and (b) have spatial variation.
Mode B cannot lase when the mode intensities are uniform in (a). Spatial variations in the
mode intensities allow mode B to lase in (b).

Figure 7 shows the photon numbers nA and nB for two modes competing on a homoge-
neous line. In Fig. 7(a) the optical mode intensities are constant, so that |uA|2 = |uB|2 =
1/(ALL) (as we implicitly assumed for the gas laser of section 2). Figure 7(a) therefore mim-
ics the case where spatial variations in the laser are negligible. Two other cases where we
can neglect spatial variation of the mode intensities are in a ring laser or in a semiconductor
laser with rapid electron diﬀusion. In Fig. 7(a) the photon number nB in mode B is ﬁxed
whenever mode A begins lasing. The solution of Eqs. (27)-(28) therefore reproduces lasing
on a homogeneous line whenever the optical mode intensities |uA|2 and |uB|2 are constant.
We let the optical mode intensities vary in space in Fig. 7(b), where we have taken the
lowest two longitudinal cavity modes (A = 1 and B = 2). Mode B can indeed begin lasing
in Fig. 7(b), but requires a higher pumping rate than for two independent lasers on the same
optical line. We have chosen parameters z = 1.1 and p = 107 in Fig. 7. The circles in Fig. 7
show the solutions from Eqs. (8)-(9) for two independent single mode lasers.

Spatial vatiations in the optical mode intensities |uA|2 and |uB|2 become less relevant
when the optical rate constant ˜KB becomes small. The ratio of the rate constants z =
˜KA/ ˜KB in Fig. 7 is z = 1.1. We increase z in Fig. 8 to (a) z = 1.3 and (b) z = 1.5, raising
the threshold current required for mode B to lase. For the parameter z = 1.5 in Fig. 8(b),
mode B no longer lases for the range of pumping currents shown (0 ≤ r ≤ 3). Although
spatial variations in the optical mode intensities are still present in Fig. 8, they become less
relevant when the optical coupling constant ˜KB for mode B is too weak.

Figure 9(a) shows the photon numbers nA and nB versus pumping and for two higher
lying longitudinal modes having A = 6 and B = 7. The photon numbers nA and nB in
Fig. 9(a) are essentially unchanged from those for the two lowest cavity modes having A = 1
and B = 2 in Fig. 7(b). Figure 9 and Fig. 7 use the same parameters, namely z = 1.1

Figure 8: Increasing the ratio of the optical rate constants from z = ˜KA/ ˜KB = 1.1 in
Figure 7 to (a) z = 1.3 and (b) z = 1.5 increases the threshold current required for mode
B to lase. Spatial variations in the optical intensities become less relevant when the optical
rate constant for mode B becomes too small.

and p = 107. The photon numbers nA and nB versus pumping therefore have little (if
any) dependence on the number of half wavelengths in the cavity. The weak dependence of
Fig. 7(a) on the number of half wavelengths (where A − B = 1) is because the fraction of the
gain media where |uB|2 ≥ |uA|2 is essentially independent of the number of half wavelengths
in the cavity, as can be checked numerically.

Spatial holes are burned into the electron density ρ(x) in Fig. 9(b), especially when mode
B begins lasing. Figure 9(b) shows the electron density ρ(x) inside the active laser medium
for diﬀerent pumping rates r. Because the mode intensities have a node at the mirrors and
there is no electron diﬀusion, the pumping rates can be read directly from the normalized
density axis at the mirrors (points l = 0 and l = 200) in Fig. 9(b). The normalized pumping
rates in Fig. 7(b) are r = 0.6, 0.8, 1.05, 1.65, 2.25, 3.0. The electron density ρ(x) is essentially
constant for pumping rates below threshold (r = 0.6, 0.8) in Fig. 7(b). There is a small
variation in electron density for pumping rates below threshold, which is invisible on the scale
in Fig. 9(b). Above threshold the variation in electron density becomes quite pronounced,
especially when mode B begins lasing (r = 1.65, 2.25, 3.0). The growth of electron density
ρ(x) as we move from the center of the gain media towards the mirrors is due to our neglect
of diﬀusion. Since the optical mode intensites |uA|2 and |uB|2 have a node at the mirrors, a
large spatial hole is also burned into the main body of the laser. Smaller spatial holes arising
from the oscillating optical mode intensities produce oscillations in the electron density.

3.2 Fast Diﬀusion

When we include diﬀusion (D 6= 0), we can no longer solve Eq. (19) directly for the
density ρ(x). Instead we discretize the active lasing medium, taking lattice points xl = la.

Figure 9: (a) Photon numbers and (b) electron density ρ(x) for two higher lying longitudinal
modes A = 6 and B = 7. The photon numbers versus pumping in (a) depend only weakly on
the number of half wavelengths in the laser cavity. Spatial holes are burned into the electron
density ρ(x) in (b), due both to the mirrors and the oscillating optical mode intensities.

Here a is the lattice spacing and 0 ≤ l ≤ lmax, with La = lmaxa the length of the active
medium. With this lattice Eq. (19) reads

Figure 10: (a) Photon numbers and (b) electron density ρ(x) when the electron diﬀusion
constant is D = (9/400)λ2 ˜A. Adding some electron diﬀusion has raised the threshold current
for mode B and reduced spatial hole burning eﬀects due to the mirrors.

Figures 10 and 11 show the eﬀects of adding electron diﬀusion to the photon numbers
and electron density in Fig. 9. In Figs. 10-11 the number of half wavelengths in the cavity
are A = 6 and B = 7 with a ratio of optical rate constants z = ˜KA/ ˜KB = 1.1, the same
parameters as in Fig. 9. Figure 10 uses a diﬀusion constant D = 100a2 ˜A with L = 200a
(t = 100p with lmax = 200), while Fig. 11 uses a larger diﬀusion constant D = 500a2 ˜A
with L = 200a (t = 500p with lmax = 200). Since the cavity is six half wavelengths long
(L = 6λ/2), we have D = (9/400)λ2 ˜A in Fig. 10 and D = (45/400)λ2 ˜A in Fig. 11. These
values for the diﬀusion constant are in good agreement with our order of magnitude estimate
for when diﬀusion should aﬀect the laser output characteristics.

Adding electron diﬀusion raises the threshold current required for mode B to lase, as
can be seen in Figs. 10(a) and 11(a). The larger the diﬀusion constant, the greater is the
threshold current required for mode B to begin lasing. Diﬀusion also reduces the spatial
hole burning eﬀects due to the mirrors, leaving only the smaller spatial holes due to the
diﬀerence in the number of half wavelengths in the cavity between modes A and B. Some
overall gradients are still visible in the electron density in Fig. 10(b), while in Fig. 11(b) the
overall average electron density density is essential uniform (mirror eﬀects are negligible).

Figure 11: (a) Photon numbers and (b) electron density ρ(x) when the electron diﬀusion
constant is D = (45/400)λ2 ˜A. The diﬀusion constant is now large enough that mirror eﬀects
are negligible. The electron density oscillates essentially periodically and the photon number
in mode B is essentially constant above threshold.

Fig. 11(b) resembles the picture of electron density used to illustrate the eﬀects of spatial
hole burning in the laser in Ref. [2].

4 Conclusions

We have generalized the laser rate equations in Refs. [2, 3] both electron scattering
between the diﬀerent lasing levels to describe spectral hole burning eﬀects in gas lasers. In
order to model spatial hole burning eﬀects present in semiconductor lasers, and guided by
Ref. [4], we then further generalized the rate equation model to include the eﬀects of spatially
varying optical mode intensities in the laser.

In order for multiple frequencies to lase simultaneously, either the energy spectrum or
spatial variation of the optical gain must be broken up into many independent (single moded)
lasers. Electron equilibration (scattering rate) is slow in gas lasers, and this allows the energy
spectrum to be broken up into many independent frequency ranges. An order or magnitude
estimate for single mode laser operation to occur in gas lasers is that the scattering rate
between electrons in the diﬀerent energy ranges must exceed the spontaneous emission rate
(s ≫ A). For semiconductor lasers the electron diﬀusion is slow, and the gain media can
be viewed as many independent lasers at each point in space. Due to spatial variations in
the optical mode intensities, diﬀerent lasing modes will be favored at each point in space.
Since the regions where diﬀerent modes dominate lasing are spatially separated by about
one quarter wavelength, we need the diﬀusion constant to exceed D ≫ λ2A/16 for single
moded operation in semiconductor lasers. Numerical simulations given in this paper agree
with these two order of magnitude estimates for the transition from single to multiple moded
laser operation.

Finally, we can summarize some general (and well known) conclusions about single versus
multiple moded laser operation. Firstly, all lasers are single moded for some range of pumping
rates near threshold. The range of pumping rates for single moded operation is larger for
more scattering between electronic states and for faster electronic diﬀusion. But a range
of pumping rates for single moded operation nonetheless exists no matter how weak the
equilibration or how slow the electronic diﬀusion (unless two degenerate states are lasing).
Secondly, all lasers become multi-moded when pumped hard enough (unless the gain medium
is ﬁrst destroyed by too high of a pumping rate). Finally, bad economic analogies do not
describe laser mode competition. Statements such as ’Laser mode competition is just like
life. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.’ are clearly incorrect. Even as the photon
number in mode A increases, the worst that can happen is that the photon number in mode
B remains constant. Mode B can also begin lasing (become an economic success) either
by electrons scattering from mode A (working in a supporting industry often created by a
competitor) or by specializing its spatial mode pattern to take advantage of optical gain
inaccessible to A (working in another area of the economy to exploit talents and resources
unavailable to a competitor).

Abstract. Electromagnetic localization and existence of gap solitons in nonlinear
metamaterials, which exhibit a stop band in their linear spectral response,
is
theoretically investigated. For a self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity, the equation for the
electric ﬁeld envelope with carrier frequency in the stop band - where the magnetic
permeability µ(ω) is positive and the dielectric permittivity ǫ(ω) is negative - is
described by a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with a dispersive nonlinear term. A
family of standing and moving localized waves for both electric and magnetic ﬁelds is
found, and the role played by the nonlinear dispersive term on solitary wave stability
is discussed.

1. Introduction

The study of electromagnetic propagation in metamaterials, i.e. artiﬁcially constructed
media showing negative eﬀective dielectric permittivity ǫ(ω) and magnetic permeability
µ(ω), has received a tremendous and increasing interest in the past few years especially
after the fabrication of microstructured materials showing negative refraction at
microwaves [1, 2, 3]. Electromagnetic wave propagation in left-handed (LF) materials
in the linear regime has been extensively investigated since the pioneering work by
Veselago [4] (see, e.g., [5, 6, 7, 8] and references therein), and many unusual eﬀects with
a potential impact in diﬀerent ﬁelds of science have been predicted, the most notably
one being the realization of a ”perfect” lens [9] which has raised a debate among the
scientiﬁc community [10]. Only very few papers [11, 12] have been so far devoted to
study nonlinear electromagnetic propagation in metamaterials despite they are expected
to exhibit nontrivial nonlinear properties [13]. In particular, surface-polariton solitons
have been studied in metamaterial interfaces assuming a simple Kerr-type nonlinearity
for the dielectric response of the medium [12]. An interesting property of composite
metamaterials, which is usually found in periodic media, is the existence of a frequency
stop band in their linear spectral response [1], corresponding to negative values of either
ǫ(ω) or µ(ω). As compared to most common band gaps found in periodic media, where
forbidden frequencies arise due to multiple Bragg scattering, in composite lossless LH
materials forbidden frequencies exist because of the special dispersion curve for the
eﬀective permittivity and permeability, which have opposite sign in a spectral interval
which separates allowed (propagative) regions of LH (i.e., ǫ, µ < 0) and right-handed
(RH, i.e. ǫ, µ > 0) waves. Experimental evidence for such band gaps at microwaves
was reported in Ref.[1] using a microstructured medium made of a periodic array of
conducting split ring resonators and wires [14]. A rather universal feature of nonlinear
periodic media exhibiting a frequency stop band in their linear dispersive response is the
existence of self-transparent gap soliton envelopes supported by the nonlinearity [15],
which have been extensively investigated in the ﬁelds of nonlinear optics [15, 16, 17, 18]
and matter waves [19, 20] and usually modelled by a generalized massive Thirring
model. The existence of a frequency stop band in metamaterials connecting RH and
LH propagative regions raises the question whether, in presence of nonlinear eﬀects, gap
solitons can be supported in microstructured media, despite Bragg scattering eﬀects do
not play any role and the medium behaves as a homogeneous one [14]. In this Letter it
is shown indeed that envelope gap solitons can be supported in lossless metamaterials
exhibiting a cubic dielectric nonlinearity when the carrier frequency of the ﬁelds is
tuned inside the stop band separating LH and RH propagative spectral regions. In Sec.
2 a nonlinear envelope equation for the electric ﬁeld is derived starting from Maxwell’s
equations in the limit of a narrow spectral band gap. The resulting equation is a complex
nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NLKGE) with a dispersive cubic term, which arises
due the strong dispersion of the magnetic permeability for linear waves. Solitary wave
solutions to this equation are studied analytically and numerically in Sec.3. In particular,

a two-parameter family of steady or moving bright solitary waves for both electric and
magnetic ﬁelds is found. Numerical simulations indicate also that these solitary waves
are stable.

2. Electromagnetic wave propagation in metamaterials with a cubic
nonlinearity: derivation of the nonlinear envelope equation

Let us consider propagation of electromagnetic plane waves in a dispersive medium, with
frequency-dependent relative dielectric permittivity ǫ(ω) and magnetic permeability
µ(ω), which exhibits an instantaneous cubic (Kerr-type) nonlinearity in its dielectric
response. Assuming quasi-monochromatic electric and magnetic ﬁelds with carrier
frequency ω0 polarized along the transverse x and y directions,
E(z, t) =

H(z, t) =
PN L = ǫ0χ(3)(E
E)E (χ(3) > 0 for a self-focusing nonlinearity), from Maxwell’s equation
the following coupled-mode equations for the slowly-varying electric and magnetic ﬁeld
envelopes

can be derived in the rotating-wave approximation:

where ωp, ωm, F , γǫ and γµ can be tuned by changing the geometrical and physical
parameters of the microstructures forming the composite medium [1, 3]. For an ideal
lossless medium, one has γǫ = γµ = 0. Referring to this ideal case and assuming a plasma
F )1/2, linear waves of Eq.(3) are evanescent
frequency ωp larger than ω = ωm/(1
(k2(ω) < 0) in the spectral interval ω < ω < ωp (band gap) , where µ(ω) > 0 but
ǫ(ω) < 0, whereas they are propagative (k2(ω) > 0) for ω > ωp and ω < ω (down to the
resonance ωm), with a LH [RH] behavior of the material on the left [right] side of the band
gap. A typical behavior of ǫ(ω) and µ(ω), for parameter values compatible with recent
experimentally fabricated structures [1], is shown in Fig.1. Let us now assume a reference

3. Gap solitons

In this section we focus our analysis on the existence and stability of stationary and
moving solitary waves to the nonlinear envelope equation derived in the previous section,
Eq.(7). From a mathematical viewpoint, Eq.(7) is a complex NLKGE which diﬀers from
the most usual ones encountered in other physical ﬁelds (see, e.g.
[23, 24, 25, 26])
due to the presence of a nonlinear dispersive term, represented by the right hand
side term in Eq.(7). The physical reason for the appearance of a nonlinear dispersive
term in the envelope equation despite the instantaneous (i.e. non-dispersive) nature
of the Kerr nonlinearity is due to the fact that close to the bandgap (ω
ω0) the
magnetic permeability µ(ω) is small and its frequency dependence can not be neglected,
leading to the appearance of the nonlinear dispersive term in Eq.(7) [27]. Using a
common terminology adopted for solitary waves in nonlinear periodic media, we will
call stationary or moving localized waves to Eq.(7) gap solitions. However, the reader
should be aware that gap solitons in metamaterials, as described by Eq.(7), have
a diﬀerent physical origin and should not be confused with usual Bragg solitons in
nonlinear periodic media, which are described by a generalized massive Thirring model
for counterpropagating ﬁelds. In fact, as we already pointed out [14], despite artiﬁcial
metamaterials show a microscopic periodic structure, they behave as homogeneous

media and Bragg scattering does not occur. In this sense, gap solitons to Eq.(7) should
be regarded as a kind of self-transparency solitary waves rather than true Bragg solitons,
thought no coherent eﬀects of the medium are involved.
In order to ﬁnd an analytical form of gap solitons, let us ﬁrst observe that, if the
dispersive nonlinear term were negligible, Eq.(7) would reduce to the well-known ψ4
NLKGE; existence and stability of bright solitary waves for such an equation were
previously studied in Ref.[23, 24]. Steady solitary waves read explicitly
Ω2)1/2z′] exp(iΩt′), where Ω is a free-family parameter
ψ(z′, t′) = [2(1
< 1 for existence), which measures the frequency oﬀset of the soliton from the
(
|
band gap center. By exploiting the Lorentz invariance of the ψ4 NLKGE, a family of
< 1 (slow
moving gap solitons, with an arbitrary velocity v satisfying the condition
gap solitons), can be then generated. A linear stability analysis of such solitary waves
shows that they are linearly stable provided that 1/√2 <
< 1 [24]. If -as it is our
case - the nonlinear dispersive term in Eq.(7) can not be neglected, an explicit analytical
form of solitary waves can not be obtained in general, and Lorentz invariance is broken.
We can nevertheless look for moving bright solitary waves of Eq.(7) in the form [28]
ψ(z′, t′) = F (z′
, where v is the solitary
wave speed and Ω, Q are real-valued parameters; with the further constraint Q = vΩ,
the envelope F can be found as a homoclinic loop emanating from the unstable solution

be then computed by numerical integration of Eq.(5). Explicit analytical expressions of
companion electric and magnetic gap solitons have been found solely in the steady case

light in vacuum.
An important issue is the stability of the solitary waves. A rigorous stability analysis is
challenging and can not be framed in the analysis of Klein-Gordon solitons developed
in Ref.[24]. However, from numerical integration of Eqs.(5) and (6) we could ascertain
stable propagation in a wide range of the existence domain. In particular, we found that
the dispersive nonlinear term entering in Eq.(7) plays a stabilizing eﬀect on the solitary
wave dynamics. We numerically integrated Eqs.(5) and (6) using a pseudospectral
split-step technique with typical 512 discretization points in a traveling reference frame
vt′ and η = t′, where the unperturbed solitary wave is at rest; as an initial
ξ = z′
condition we assumed a solitary wave perturbed with a small random noise to seed
possible instabilities. As an example, stable evolution of a steady solitary wave, with
carrier frequency at the band gap center, and of a moving solitary wave are shown in
Fig.3. We note that, if the nonlinear dispersive term in Eq.(7) were neglected, the
steady solitary wave of Fig.3(a) would be unstable according to the analysis of Ref.[24].
We checked indeed the stabilizing eﬀect played by the nonlinear dispersive term by a
numerical analysis of Eq.(7) with and without the right hand side term, assuming as an
initial condition their respective non-moving solitary waves with an added small random
noise. We assessed the reliability of our numerical method by exactly reproducing the
stability domain 1/√2 <
< 1 for steady solitary waves of the ψ4 NLKGE according
to the linear stability analysis [24]. Figure 4 shows the numerical results of evolution
of the steady solitary waves of Eq.(7) at the band gap center in absence [Fig.4(a)] and
in presence [Fig.4(b)] of the nonlinear dispersive term. Note that, as in the former
case the solitary wave is unstable according to the linear stability analysis [24], in
the latter case no unstable growing modes were observed in the numerical simulation,
indicating that the nonlinear dispersive term plays a stabilizing eﬀect. The emergence of
instabilities for gap solitons and their physical explanation are usually nontrivial issues
and represent a challenging task [29]; therefore a detailed physical explanation of the
instability suppression observed in our numerical simulations goes beyond the aim of the
present work. We just mention that for the NLKGE without the nonlinear dispersive
< 1/√2),
term the instability of the gap soliton close to the band gap center (
as numerically reproduced in Fig.4(a), arises because of the emergence of an unstable
internal mode of the soliton [24]. Our numerical results suggest that the presence of
the nonlinear dispersive term in the NLKGE makes such internal mode damped in the
entire bandgap region of linear waves (

4. Conclusions

In conclusion, we have predicted the existence of stationary and moving gap solitary
waves for electric and magnetic ﬁelds in metamaterials with a Kerr nonlinearity. These
waves, which are supported by the nonlinear dielectric response of the medium, exist
in the band gap spectral region of the medium, corresponding to ǫ < 0 and µ > 0,
which separates the spectral regions of allowed propagation where the medium behaves

as a LH or as a RH material. The gap solitary waves studied in this work - which
can be described by a complex NLKGE with a dispersive cubic term - represent a new
class of gap solitons in artiﬁcially-constructed microstructured periodic media which do
not involve Bragg scattering and provide a noteworthy and physically relevant example
of self-transparent electromagnetic wave propagation in the recently developed class of
composite metamaterials.

[14] It should be noted that, though artiﬁcially constructed metamaterials show a periodic structure
[3], the interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld occurs in the long-wavelength limit (i.e. the
wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is much larger than the characteristic period of
the microstructured material), so that a metamaterial behaves as a homogeneous dielectric and
magnetic medium with an eﬀective electric permittivity ǫ and magnetic permeability µ which
are strongly inﬂuenced by the internal (microscopic) structure of the medium [3]. The existence
of a frequency stop band arises because of ǫµ < 0 in the frequency range separating LH and RH
propagative spectral regions. Conversely, in periodic media such as gratings and photonic crystals
the wavelength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is comparable with the characteristic period of the
structure and Bragg diﬀraction eﬀects are fundamental to create forbidden spectral regions.

magnetic ﬁeld ϕ (lower ﬁgures) for a few values of family parameters v and Ω.
Continuous curves: modulus square of the ﬁelds ; dotted curves: real part of the
ﬁelds; dashed curves: imaginary part of the ﬁelds. In (a) steady soliton with v = 0
and Ω = 0 (see Eqs.(9) and (10) given in the text); in (b) moving soliton with v = 0.8
and Ω = 0; in (c) moving soliton with v = 0.8 and Ω = 1.2 (the real and imaginary
parts are taken at t′ = 0 in this case). In the plots of lower ﬁgures (magnetic ﬁeld),
we assumed ǫ

0 = 1.

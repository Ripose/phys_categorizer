Microscopic Origin of Spatial Coherence and Wolf Shifts∗

I. INTRODUCTION

Wolf 1,2,3,4 discovered how the spatial coherence characteristics of the source aﬀect the spectrum of the radiation
in the far zone. In particular the spatial coherence of the source can result either in red or blue shifts in the measured
spectrum.His predictions have been veriﬁed in a large number of diﬀerent classes of systems. Wolf and coworkers
usually assume a given form of source correlations and study its consequence. In this paper we consider microscopic
origin of spatial coherence and radiation from a system of atoms5,6,7,8. We discuss how the radiation is diﬀerent from
that produced from an independent system of atoms. We show that the process of radiation itself is responsible for the
creation of spatial correlations within the source. We present diﬀerent features of the spectrum and other statistical
properties of the radiation, which show strong dependence on the spatial correlations. We show the existence of a
new type of two-photon resonance that arises as a result of such spatial correlations. We further show how the spatial
coherence of the ﬁeld can be used in the context of radiation generated by nonlinear optical processes. We conclude
by demonstrating the universality of Wolf shifts and its application in the context of pulse propagation in a dispersive
medium.

We start by giving a summary of Wolf’s main results1,2. Consider the radiation produced by two point sources
P1 and P2 at the observation point P , Fig. 1. Let us consider for simplicity the case of scalar ﬁelds U (P, ω). The
spectrum of the ﬁeld at P is given by

where as the spectrum of the source is deﬁned by

We assume identical spectra for the two sources. Let µQ(ω) be the spectral degree of coherence between two sources

This is a measure of correlation between the two sources. For two coherent sources µ is 1 whereas for incoherent
sources µ = 0. The ﬁeld U at the point P can be related to the strength of the sources via

Here we have ignored unnecessary numerical factors. Using Eq. (5) the spectrum of the ﬁeld is related to the spectrum
of the source and the degree of spatial coherence

Clearly in general, the source spectrum and the spectrum at P are not equal

SU (P, ω) 6= SQ(ω).

Clearly the measured spectral characteristics will also be determined by µQ and SU (P, ω), in general, would exhibit
correlation induced spectral shifts. Wolf used phenomenological model for SQ and µQ to demonstrate a variety of
spectral shifts and even the correlation induced splitting of a line into several lines. Clearly it is desirable to understand
the origin of source correlations.

II. MICROSCOPIC ORIGIN OF SOURCE CORRELATIONS

We thus examine the question of how the atom radiate. Consider for example an atom in its excited state. It
interacts with the modes of quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum state. The atom makes a transition to the
ground state by the emission of a photon. The photon can be emitted in any mode of the ﬁeld. The atom has inﬁnity
of available modes. It is known that the spectrum of the emitted radiation has Lorentzian spectrum

where ω0 is the frequency of the atomic transition and γ is half the Einstein A coeﬃcient.

Next consider two atoms located at ~rA and ~rB. Let each atom be initially in its excited state. The question is
whether the atoms radiate independently of each other i.e. whether the spectrum of the emitted photons factorizes

or not. The correlations between the two atoms6,7,8 would invalidate (9) and it would in general also imply that

i.e., the spectrum of the emitted radiation would be diﬀerent from the one if the other atom was absent. Note that
both atoms interact with a common quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld. This interaction with a common ﬁeld results
in an eﬀective interaction between two atoms even if the atoms do not interact. This can also be understood by
considering, say, the net ﬁeld on the atom B(A) which would consist of the vacuum ﬁeld and ﬁeld radiated by the
atom A(B). Let us denote by χij(~rA, ~rB, ω) as the i − th component of the ﬁeld at position ~rA due to a unit dipole
oriented in the direction j at the position ~rB.

This function has close connection with the spatial coherence of the vacuum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Let us write
the electric ﬁeld operator in terms of its positive and negative frequency parts

E = E(+) + E(−).

It is well known in quantum optics that E(+)(E(−)) corresponds to the absorption (emission) of photons. Further
E(+) is an analytical signal. Let us consider second order coherence function of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

which is non-vanishing even-though the ﬁeld is in vacuum state. Its Fourier transform is given by9

= 0

if ω < 0.

We thus conclude that the vacuum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has spatial coherence which extends over the dimensions
of wavelength. Therefore the correlation between atoms would extend over at least distances of the order of wavelength.
Clearly in a macroscopic sample these correlation could build up over much larger distances. Explicit results for two
atoms can be found in Refs. [6],[7],[8].

We next discuss several other situations where atom-atom correlations play an important role. Consider ﬁrst the
case of two unidentical atoms with transition frequencies ωA and ωB and which are located within a wavelength of
each other. Let both the atoms start in ground state and let these interact with a laser ﬁeld of frequency ωl. We now
study the total intensity I(ωl) of the emitted radiation as a function of ωl. Clearly I(ωl) will exhibit single photon
resonance at ωl = ωAeg, ωBeg. In principle there is also the possibility of two photon resonance 2ωl = ωAeg + ωBeg. It
turns out that in the absence of source correlations, the two photon resonance does not occur as the two paths

|gA, gBi → |eA, gBi → |eA, eBi, and |gA, gBi → |gA, eBi → |eA, eBi

(15)

interfere destructively. Thus the source correlations are the key to the two photon resonance. In an earlier work the
eﬀect of source correlations on such a two photon resonance was studied in great detail7 and recently it has been
observed in experiments involving single molecules12 further very recently we show how the source correlation arise
in a cavity13.

FIG. 6.

Another class of systems where spatial coherence plays an important role is for example, the emission of radiation
in front of a metallic mirror10 or in a cavity formed by metallic or dielectric mirrors. The spectrum of the emitted
radiation depends on the distance of the atom from mirror. As a matter of fact both line width and line shift become
b-dependent. If the metallic mirror is treated as a perfect conductor, then the calculations show that the line shifts,
for example, are determined by the spatial coherence of the ﬁeld at the location of the atom and its image. Thus the
)i, which is related to χ(~b, −~b, ω), determines the line shifts and line
correlation of the vacuum h ~E(+)(~b, t) ~E(−)(−~b, t
widths. Explicit results for the b - dependence of shifts and widths can be found in Refs. [10],[14].

V. SPATIAL COHERENCE INDUCED CONTROL OF NONLINEAR GENERATION

We next discuss the eﬀects of spatial coherence in the context of nonlinear optics. We would show that the generation
of radiation using nonlinear processes can be controlled by source correlations. Consider for example, the process of
second harmonic generation (SHG) with P = χ(2)E2, E ∼ ei~k.~r. The eﬃciency of the SHG depends on the phase
matching integral

f =

which goes to unity if ~q = 2~k.The function f determines the direction in which second harmonic generation is
dominant.

Clearly now the direction of SHG would be determined by the spatial coherence of the ﬁeld. Thus spatial coherence
can serve as a control parameter for the nonlinear generation. Clearly the above ideas should also ﬁnd interesting
applications in other areas of nonlinear optics as well.

VI. UNIVERSALITY OF WOLF SHIFT

Before concluding the paper we also like to make some general remarks for the universality and applicability of
Wolf shifts in the context of other systems. We know for instance, that other standard equations of physics (such as
those describing vibrations of string, heat transport) admit following relation between the eﬀect Φ of the source P at
the observation point

where G is Green’s function for the underlying equation. The observed quantities are usually quadratic in Φ. Thus
observation at the point ~r would depend on the correlations of the source at two points. This is due to the nonlocal
nature of the solution (26).

VII. FLUCTUATING PULSES IN A DISPERSIVE MEDIUM

As another example of this universality we can consider the propagation of pulses in a dispersive medium which is

described by the equation

Clearly the intensity of the pulse at the output plane is not completely determined by the intensity of the pulse at
input plane.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

Thus in conclusion we have shown that the vacuum of electromagnetic ﬁeld has intrinsic partial spatial coherence
in frequency domain which eﬀectively extends over regions of the order of wavelength λ. This spatial coherence leads
to a dynamical coupling between atoms and is the cause of source correlations. We showed how such correlations can
lead to a new type of two photon resonance and how these are relevant for near ﬁeld optics. We further showed how
the source spatial correlations can lead to new phase matching conditions for nonlinear optical eﬀects leading to the
possibility of using spatial coherence to produce tailor made emissions. We also discussed the universality of source
correlation eﬀects and as a speciﬁc example we treated the case of the propagation of ﬂuctuating pulses in a dispersive
medium.

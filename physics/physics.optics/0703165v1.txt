Application of the multiple-scattering method to analysis of systems with semi-inﬁnite
photonic waveguides

We propose a technique of compensating the spurious reﬂections implied by the
multiple-scattering (MS) method, commonly used for analyzing ﬁnite photonic
crystal (PC) systems, to obtain exact values of characteristic parameters, such
as reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, of PC functional elements. Rather
than a modiﬁcation of the MS computational algorithm, our approach involves
postprocessing of results obtained by the MS method. We derive analytical
formulas for the ﬁelds excited in a ﬁnite system, taking explicitly into account
the spurious reﬂections occurring at the artiﬁcial system boundaries. The in-
trinsic parameters of the investigated functional element are found by ﬁtting
the results of MS simulations to those obtained from the formulas derived. De-
vices linked with one and two semi-inﬁnite waveguides are analyzed explicitly;
possible extensions of the formalism to more complex circuits are discussed
as well. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested in a number of sys-
tems; the results of our calculations prove to be in good agreement with those
obtained independently by other authors.

Introduction

Photonic crystals (PCs) have recently become the ob-
ject of increased interest as possible hosts for optical
functional devices, e.g., beam splitters, demultiplexers,
[1] These elements, as well as the basic build-
etc.
ing blocks of photonic integrated circuits—waveguide
bends, junctions etc.—have often been investigated by
methods designed for ﬁnite systems, such as the ﬁnite-
diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method [2] and the
multiple-scattering (MS) method [3, 4]. Consequently,
the devices in question were considered to be embedded
in a ﬁnite fragment of a PC. This, however, involved spu-
rious reﬂections at the artiﬁcial PC boundaries, signiﬁ-
cantly complicating the analysis of the device behavior.
To remedy this situation, several methods suitable
for analyzing systems with semi-inﬁnite waveguides have
been developed.
In the eﬀective discrete equations
method [5] and the Wannier function method [6], the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are represented in a basis of
states localized at elementary defects; various grating-
based techniques, like those presented in [7, 8, 9], have
been developed as well. Both approaches, however, im-
pose some restrictions on the problems to which they
can be applied:
the former is ill-suited to open sys-
tems (i.e., those with vacuum regions extending to in-
ﬁnity), while the latter only applies to systems with uni-

directional waveguides. Recently, the multiple multipole
method has been extended by Moreno et al. [10] to sys-
tems with semi-inﬁnite waveguides; here, the ﬁelds on a
transverse section of each waveguide, suﬃciently distant
from discontinuities (junction, bend etc.), are matched
to a linear combination of the waveguide eigenstates. As
demonstrated in [10], this technique is very general and
applicable also to the problems which cannot be dealt by
the other above-mentioned methods.

The aim of this paper is to show how to take into ac-
count the presence of semi-inﬁnite waveguides in calcula-
tions performed on the basis of the MS technique. Owing
to its particular simplicity and eﬃciency in dealing with
the case of PCs composed of cylindrical rods, this tech-
nique has gained signiﬁcant popularity [11, 12, 13]. Al-
though the approach proposed by Moreno et al. [10] could
be straightforwardly carried over to the combination of
the MS method and the method of ﬁctitious sources, for-
mulated in [14], this would require signiﬁcant changes
in the computational procedure, as well as availability
of externally calculated data describing the ﬁelds corre-
sponding to the waveguide eigenstates. In contrast, the
approach outlined below consists solely in postprocess-
ing of the results obtained by the ‘pure’ MS method.
While admittedly less general than the other technique,
it is nevertheless applicable to a number of situations
frequently encountered in practice. Two of them are dis-
cussed in Sections 2 and 3, in which the proposed proce-
dure is applied to devices linked with one waveguide and
two waveguides, respectively. Possible extensions of the
method are discussed in Section 4.

2. One waveguide

A. Theory

The ﬁrst system to be considered is a single waveguide
terminated at the surface of a semi-inﬁnite PC [Fig. 1(a)].
A frequently discussed problem (see, e.g., [15, 16, 17]) is
the design of the precise shape of the waveguide outlet
that would allow maximization of the power transmit-
ted into free space. In this case, the main objective is to
calculate the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the outlet; the inten-
sity of the ﬁeld produced at some point of the free-space
region (possibly at inﬁnity) when an eigenmode of uni-
tary power propagates towards the end of the waveguide
is sometimes searched for, too. In the following we will
show how both quantities can be found on the basis of
calculations done for the ﬁnite system shown in Fig. 1(b),
presenting a waveguide that is N unit cells long.

The waveguide is assumed to be a single-mode one, and
its unit cell to have a mirror-symmetry plane parallel to
the yz plane, so that the propagating Bloch states of the
waveguide are characterized by wave numbers k and −k.
An arbitrary source S placed near the waveguide inlet ex-
cites the right-propagating mode, which then undergoes
multiple reﬂections. Let un and dn (n = 0, 1, . . . , N ) de-
note the z component of the electric (TM polarization)
or magnetic (TE polarization) ﬁeld corresponding to the
mode of wave number k and −k, respectively, at point n
represented by coordinates (x = na, y = y0) in Fig. 1(b).
The choice of y0 is arbitrary; the zero value can be as-
sumed unless the waveguide eigenmode is antisymmetric
with respect to the xz plane. From the Bloch theorem,
we have

the following ‘boundary conditions’:

where r and r′ are the reﬂection coeﬃcients at the wave-
guide outlet and inlet, respectively, and uinc stands for
the eﬀective ﬁeld corresponding to the right-propagating
mode excited by the source S, extrapolated to point
n = 0. By combining Eqs. (1)–(3) and eliminating the
variables u0, d0, uN , and dN , we get the linear system

.

In cells lying suﬃciently far from the waveguide ends for
the contribution of the evanescent states to be negligible,
the total ﬁeld fn can be expressed only in terms of the
propagating modes:

fn = un + dn =

Φn + rΦ2N −n
1 − rr′Φ2N uinc.

We are interested in the reﬂection coeﬃcient r, as well
as in the intensity |f ideal(Q)|2 of the ﬁeld which would
be generated at some point Q in the free space if
the waveguide were semi-inﬁnite and the incident right-
propagating mode carried unitary power.

(5)

(6)

The reﬂection coeﬃcient can be found simply by least-
squares ﬁtting of the numerically calculated values of
fn+1/fn to those calculated by the formula resulting from
Eq. (6):

since the incident power in each case is proportional to
|uinc|2. As shown in the Appendix, the total power ﬂow-
ing through an arbitrary transverse section of the wave-
guide is equal to

3

(12)

1 − |r|2

P =

|1 − rr′Φ2N |2 Pinc.

This power can be easily calculated by the MS method.
By using Eq. (12) for eliminating from Eq. (11) the factor
|1 − rr′Φ2N |2, which contains the unknown coeﬃcient r′,
we ﬁnally get

|f ideal(Q)|2 = (1 − |r|2)

|f (Q)|2.

To sum up, the data obtained in a single MS calcu-
lation performed for a ﬁnite system with an N -cell-long
waveguide suﬃce for determination of the reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient of the waveguide outlet, as well as the ‘corrected’
ﬁeld intensity in free space. When only the former quan-
tity is required, the ﬁeld excited at N +1 sites lying along
the waveguide axis is all that needs to be calculated in
the simulation; otherwise, the power ﬂow through an ar-
bitrary transverse section of the ﬁnite waveguide must be
computed too.

B. Examples

As an example of application of these results, let us ﬁrst
consider the system shown in Fig. 1(a): a W1-type wave-
guide embedded in a hexagonal lattice of dielectric cylin-
ders with permittivity 11.56 and radius 0.18a, where a is
the lattice constant. The surface termination creates a
slight tapering of the waveguide exit. Figure 2 presents
the frequency dependence of the reﬂection coeﬃcient |r|2
in this conﬁguration; the results obtained by the pro-
posed technique are compared to the data reported in [18]
[Fig. 7(c)], acquired by the plane-wave-based transfer-
matrix method. Our calculations were done for wave-
guide length N = 15 with margin B = 4. The con-
in fact, the data obtained in the
vergence is very fast:

In addition to r, this gives also the value of Φ, which can
be used for calculating the wave number k. Let us note
by the way that solving Eq. (7) for n = l − 1 and n = l,
where l is some ﬁxed integer, yields

(7)

(8a)

(8b)

these values, calculated for l ≈ N/2, i.e., near the wave-
guide center, can be used as starting points in the nonlin-
ear least-squares ﬁtting procedure. The sign of k should
correspond to the physics of the problem at hand.

It should be stressed that only cells distant enough
from the waveguide ends (i.e., those labeled n = B, B +
1, . . . , N − B, where the ‘margin’ B is a suﬃciently large
integer) should be taken into account in the above ﬁt-
ting procedure, since Eq. (7) has been derived with the
assumption that evanescent states are of negligible am-
plitude in the cells labeled n and n + 1.

Let us proceed to the determination of |f ideal(Q)|2.
The intensity |f (Q)|2 of the ﬁeld generated at point Q in
the ﬁnite system can be written as

|f (Q)|2 = |t|2|τ (Q)|2|uN |2 =

|t|2|τ (Q)|2
|1 − rr′Φ2N |2 |uinc|2,

(9)

where the transmission coeﬃcient |t|2 = 1 − |r|2 repre-
sents the fraction of the total energy emitted into free
space when a waveguide mode reaches the outlet, and
the ‘transfer coeﬃcient’ τ (Q), dependent on the position
of Q and the geometry of the waveguide outlet, but not
on the waveguide length, is a measure of the amount of
this energy getting to point Q. In the ideal case of the
semi-inﬁnite waveguide, r′ would be zero; thus,

|f ideal(Q)|2 = |t|2|τ (Q)|2|uideal

inc |2

(10)

with |uideal
carry power P ideal

inc = 1. From Eqs. (9)–(10) we get

N = 7, B = 2 case (essentially the shortest waveguide
for which ﬁtting makes sense) diﬀer by at most 6% from
those plotted in the graph, and for frequency values below
0.468 × 2πc/a the diﬀerence does not exceed 1%. There
is a good agreement between our results and those of Lin
and Li [18], except for a small peak at frequency value
ω ≈ 0.46 × 2πc/a, present in the |r(ω)|2 plot obtained
by these Authors, but not reproduced by the curve re-
sulting from our calculations. Since the waveguide is a
single-mode one and the mode dispersion curve is smooth
around this frequency value, the physical origin of this
sharp peak is not clear to us and we believe it might be
a numerical artifact.

As a second example, let us consider the leaky-wave
photonic antenna [19, 20, 21] shown in Fig. 3(a). Here,
the surface surrounding the waveguide outlet is corru-
gated with period 2a and supports leaky surface modes,
which are excited by the radiation coming from the wave-
guide. At a certain frequency value waves scattered
at individual perturbed surface cylinders interfere con-
structively along the surface normal to produce a colli-
mated beam. Figure 3(b) presents the frequency depen-
dence of the far-ﬁeld intensity of the radiation emitted
perpendicularly to the surface; the outcomes of ‘na¨ıve’
calculations done for ﬁnite-length waveguides are jux-
taposed with those obtained by the proposed scheme
for the semi-inﬁnite waveguide. All curves are normal-
ized to their absolute maxima. Evidently, in the ﬁnite-
waveguide case, the shape of the main peak depends
on the precise length of the waveguide; this dependence
is especially pronounced to the right of the maximum,
where the intensity values obtained for waveguides 11
and 12 cells long diﬀer by as much as a factor of two.
On the other hand, the sidelobes in the frequency range
ω < 0.40×2πc/a are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by changes
in the waveguide length; this leads to the conclusion that
they result from interference occurring at the crystal sur-
face rather than in the waveguide.

text. Smigaj-3.eps

In this Section, we will focus on the more complex system
with two linked semi-inﬁnite waveguides; the link can be
realized, for instance, by a junction, a bend or a resonant
cavity where scattering can occur. Our goal is to calcu-
late the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients of this
discontinuity. The waveguides are again assumed to be
single-mode ones and to possess a transverse symmetry
plane; to these assumptions let us add that of their iden-
tical geometry. Figure 4 depicts the ﬁnite system used
in numerical calculations, where the left and right wave-
guide comprise N and M unit cells, respectively, and the
ﬁeld is excited by the source S.

Let un and dn denote the ﬁeld (electric or magnetic,
depending on the polarization), at point n = 0, 1, . . . , N
inside the left waveguide in Fig. 4, corresponding to the
incoming and outgoing guided modes, respectively. Their

right-waveguide counterparts at point m = 0, 1, . . . , M
will be labeled ¯um and ¯dm. The junction linking the
waveguides can be described by its scattering matrix ˆS

where r is the reﬂection coeﬃcient at the waveguide outer

(19b)

The above procedure can be repeated for the situation
when source S is replaced with source ¯S located near the
entry of the right waveguide; in this case, the ﬁelds gn
and ¯gm in the left and the right waveguides are given by

¯τ (rΦn + Φ−n)ΦN +M

(20b)

¯uinc being deﬁned analogously to uinc.

It is important to note that the MS method allows very

eﬃcient calculation of the ﬁelds excited in a single struc-
ture by several independent sources (e.g., S and ¯S), since
the scattering matrix of the whole system, whose diago-
nalization is by far the most time-consuming step of the
computational algorithm, is independent of the incident
ﬁeld [3, 4]. In the following we show how the values of
fn, ¯fm, gn, and ¯gm, calculated by the MS method, can
be used for determination of the junction parameters ρ,
¯ρ, τ , and ¯τ . As before, in all these computations only
cells suﬃciently distant from the waveguide ends should
be taken into account.

4. The reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients ρ, ¯ρ,
τ , and ¯τ can now be calculated from Eqs. (23)–
(24), since the values of all the other parameters
are already known.

B. Example

To test the accuracy of our method, we are going to
apply it to the waveguide bend depicted in Fig. 4. A
number of numerical studies of this system, using dif-
ferent methods, are available in the literature [5, 6, 10],
providing a reference for new techniques. The super-
imposed plot in Fig. 5 shows the frequency dependence
of the reﬂection coeﬃcient |ρ(ω)|2 (since the bend is
symmetric, ρ = ¯ρ) calculated according to the above-
presented scheme against the spectra obtained by the ef-
fective discrete equations method [5], the Wannier func-
tion method [6], and the multiple multipole method [10].
Clearly, the overall shape of all four curves is very simi-
lar, although the exact values of |ρ(ω)|2 diﬀer, especially
near the boundaries of the bulk crystal gap. The spec-
trum resulting from our calculations is almost identical
to that calculated by Moreno et al. [10] This may be
partly due to the similarity of the MS and multiple mul-
tipole methods (in both of them the ﬁeld is expanded in
a basis of Bessel and Hankel functions); however, it must
also be noted that these methods are intrinsically ‘exact’
in the sense that the Maxwell equations are solved rig-
orously, which makes the calculations accuracy only de-
pend on the maximum order of the basis functions kept,

and the results are known to be rapidly convergent with
the truncation order [4].
In contrast, the derivation of
the eﬀective discrete equations [5] involves a number of
approximations (for instance, only the monopole eigen-
modes of the elementary defects are taken into account).
This may be the reason why the reﬂection coeﬃcient cal-
culated by Mingaleev et al. takes values ∼ 30% larger
than those obtained in our approach.

4. Extensions

The two device classes discussed above, i.e., those linked
with one or two semi-inﬁnite waveguides, represent a
large fraction of commonly investigated photonic build-
ing blocks. Though the two-waveguide case has been ana-
lyzed with the assumption of identical geometry of both
waveguides, this condition can be eliminated, with the
transmission coeﬃcients renormalized to refer to eigen-
modes carrying unitary power, in a way similar to that
presented for a single waveguide at the end of Section 2 A.
Our formalism can be extended to systems with more
than two waveguides as well. However, many such sys-
tems, including most T and Y junctions discussed in the
literature, are symmetric with respect to the axis of one
or more constituent waveguides. Therefore, they can also
be analyzed with the simpler two-waveguide formalism
presented in this paper. To see this, note that the scat-
tering matrix ˆS of a three-waveguide junction is deﬁned
by [cf. Eq. (14)]

where ui
N and di
N refer to the incoming and outgoing
mode, respectively, in the ith waveguide (i = 1, 2, 3).
For simplicity reasons, all the waveguides are assumed
to be of the same length N . If waveguides 2 and 3 are
identical and the axis of waveguide 1 is a symmetry plane
of the system, we have ρ2 = ρ3, τ12 = τ13, τ21 = τ31,
and τ23 = τ32. To these equalities we can add u2

Therefore,
the junction can be treated as a two-
waveguide system with eﬀective reﬂection and transmis-
sion coeﬃcients given by the above formula. The val-
ues of these parameters can be calculated by the method
presented in Section 3. Evidently, the coeﬃcients ρ2 and
τ23 occur only in the form of their sum, and therefore
cannot be obtained independently. However, normally,
the quantities of interest are the coeﬃcients ρ1 and τ12,
which are related to transmission and reﬂection of the
radiation incoming from the ﬁrst (‘input’) waveguide.
Equation (30) clearly shows that these parameters can be

obtained straightforwardly from the two-waveguide for-
malism.

5. Conclusions

We have presented a method, based on multiple-
scattering numerical simulations performed for ﬁnite sys-
tems, allowing to ﬁnd the reﬂection and transmission co-
eﬃcients of photonic crystal functional elements linked
with ideal semi-inﬁnite waveguides. As our approach
does not involve modiﬁcation of the existing code imple-
menting the multiple-scattering method, no serious pro-
gramming and testing eﬀort are necessary for its appli-
cation. The proposed formalism allows for dealing with
a wide variety of photonic crystal building blocks likely
to be encountered in practice, as demonstrated by its
successful application to a tapered waveguide outlet, a
photonic crystal leaky-wave antenna, and a waveguide
bend.

Appendix: Power ﬂow in ﬁnite waveguides

This Appendix presents the derivation of formula (12) for
the power ﬂowing through an arbitrary transverse section
of the waveguide shown in Fig. 1(b). Only TM polariza-
tion will be considered; the procedure to be followed in
the case of TE polarization is completely analogous.

The power P (na) ﬂowing to the right through a plane
x = na (perpendicular to the waveguide axis) per unit
length in the z direction is given by the integral of the
x component of the time-averaged Poynting vector S:

P (na) =

From Eq. (6) we have

.

(cid:21)

(A.1)

Ez(na, y) =

Φn + rΦ2N −n
1 − rr′Φ2N ez(y),

(A.2)

where ez(y) denotes the electric ﬁeld corresponding to
the right-propagating waveguide eigenmode of amplitude
satisfying the condition ez(0) = uinc. Similarly, for the
magnetic ﬁeld we obtain

Hy(na, y) =

Φn − rΦ2N −n
1 − rr′Φ2N hy(y);

(A.3)

note the change of sign in the numerator, which results
from the magnetic ﬁeld being a pseudovector. By includ-
ing these formulas into Eq. (A.1), after some straightfor-
ward algebra, we arrive at

P (na) =

|1 − rr′Φ2N |2

where

(A.5)

From the conservation of energy, P (na) must be constant
for all n, since the waveguide is not leaky. We conclude
that the second term in braces in Eq. (A.4), being n-
dependent, must be identically zero; this leads to the
following condition for the ﬁelds corresponding to the
waveguide eigenmode:

Im J = 0.

(A.6)

In consequence, Eq. (A.4) simpliﬁes to

1 − |r|2

P =

|1 − rr′Φ2N |2 Pinc,

(A.7)

where Pinc ≡ Re J denotes the power carried by the in-
cident mode.

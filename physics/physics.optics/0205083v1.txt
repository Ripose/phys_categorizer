Abstract
Matrix representations of the Maxwell equations are well-known. However,
all these representations lack an exactness or/and are given in terms of a
pair of matrix equations. We present a matrix representation of the Maxwell
equation in presence of sources in a medium with varying permittivity and
permeability. It is shown that such a representation necessarily requires 8
8
matrices and an explicit representation for them is presented.

1 Introduction

Matrix representations of the Maxwell equations are very well-known [1]-
[3]. However, all these representations lack an exactness or/and are given in
terms of a pair of matrix equations. Some of these representations are in free
space. Such a representation is an approximation in a medium with space-
and time-dependent permittivity ǫ(r, t) and permeability µ(r, t) respectively.
Even this approximation is often expressed through a pair of equations using
3 matrices: one for the curl and one for the divergence which occur in
3
the Maxwell equations. This practice of writing the divergence condition
4 matrices [1] for Maxwell
separately is completely avoidable by using 4
equations in free-space. A single equation using 4
4 matrices is necessary
and suﬃcient when ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) are treated as ‘local’ constants [1, 3].
A treatment taking into account the variations of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) has
been presented in [3]. This treatment uses the Riemann-Silberstein vectors,

×

×

×

F ± (r, t) to reexpress the Maxwell equations as four equations: two equations
are for the curl and two are for the divergences and there is mixing in F + (r, t)
and F − (r, t). This mixing is very neatly expressed through the two derived
functions of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t). These four equations are then expressed as a
pair of matrix equations using 6
6 matrices: again one for the curl and one
for the divergence. Even though this treatment is exact it involves a pair of
matrix equations.

×

Here, we present a treatment which enables us to express the Maxwell
equations in a single matrix equation instead of a pair of matrix equations.
Our approach is a logical continuation of the treatment in [3]. We use the
linear combination of the components of the Riemann-Silberstein vectors,
F ± (r, t) and the ﬁnal matrix representation is a single equation using 8
8
matrices. This representation contains all the four Maxwell equations in
presence of sources taking into account the spatial and temporal variations
of the permittivity ǫ(r, t) and the permeability µ(r, t).

×

In Section-I we shall summarize the treatment for a homogeneous medium
In Section-II we shall
and introduce the required functions and notation.
present the matrix representation in an inhomogeneous medium, in presence
of sources.

2 Homogeneous Medium

We shall start with the Maxwell equations [4, 5] in an inhomogeneous medium
with sources,

We assume the media to be linear, that is D = ǫE, and B = µH, where
ǫ is the permittivity of the medium and µ is the permeability of the
medium. In general ǫ = ǫ(r, t) and µ = µ(r, t). In this section we treat them
as ‘local’ constants in the various derivations. The magnitude of the velocity

One possible way to obtain the required matrix representation is to use

For any homogeneous medium it is equivalent to use either F + (r, t) or
F − (r, t). The two diﬀer by the sign before ‘i’ and are not the complex
conjugate of one another. We have not assumed any form for E(r, t) and
B(r, t). We will be needing both of them in an inhomogeneous medium, to
be considered in detail in Section-III.

If for a certain medium ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) are constants (or can be treated
as ‘local’ constants under certain approximations), then the vectors F ± (r, t)
satisfy

Thus, by using the Riemann-Silberstein vector it has been possible to reex-
press the four Maxwell equations (for a medium with constant ǫ and µ) as
two equations. The ﬁrst one contains the the two Maxwell equations with
curl and the second one contains the two Maxwell with divergences. The
ﬁrst of the two equations in (3) can be immediately converted into a 3
3
matrix representation. However, this representation does not contain the di-
vergence conditions (the ﬁrst and the fourth Maxwell equations) contained
in the second equation in (3). A further compactiﬁcation is possible only by
4 matrix representation. To this

to the Lagrange brackets of classical mechanics and J corresponds to the
Poisson brackets. An important relation is Ω = J −1. The M-matrices are:

Each of the four Maxwell equations are easily obtained from the matrix
representation in (6). This is done by taking the sums and diﬀerences of
row-I with row-IV and row-II with row-III respectively. The ﬁrst three give
the y, x and z components of the curl and the last one gives the divergence
conditions present in the evolution equation (3).

It is to be noted that the matrices M are all non-singular and all are
hermitian. Moreover, they satisfy the usual algebra of the Dirac matrices,
including,

Mxβ =

Before proceeding further we note the following: The pair (Ψ±, M ) are
not unique. Diﬀerent choices of Ψ± would give rise to diﬀerent M , such that
the triplet M continues to to satisfy the algebra of the Dirac matrices in (9).
We have preferred Ψ± via the the Riemann-Silberstein vector (2) in [3]. This
vector has certain advantages over the other possible choices. The Riemann-
Silberstein vector is well-known in classical electrodynamics and has certain
interesting properties and uses [3].

In deriving the above 4

4 matrix representation of the Maxwell equations
we have ignored the spatial and temporal derivatives of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) in
the ﬁrst two of the Maxwell equations. We have treated ǫ and µ as ‘local’
constants.

In the previous section we wrote the evolution equations for the Riemann-
Silberstein vector in (3), for a medium, treating ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) as ‘local’

constants. From these pairs of equations we wrote the matrix form of the
Maxwell equations. In this section we shall write the exact equations taking
into account the spatial and temporal variations of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t).
It
is very much possible to write the required evolution equations using ǫ(r, t)
and µ(r, t). But we shall follow the procedure in [3] of using the two derived
laboratory functions

Velocity Function : v(r, t) =

Resistance Function : h(r, t) =

(10)

The function, v(r, t) has the dimensions of velocity and the function, h(r, t)
has the dimensions of resistance (measured in Ohms). We can equivalently
use the Conductance Function, κ(r, t) = 1/h(r, t) = ǫ(r, t)/µ(r, t) (measured
in Ohms−1 or Mhos!)
in place of the resistance function, h(r, t). These
derived functions enable us to understand the dependence of the variations
more transparently [3]. Moreover the derived functions are the ones which
are measured experimentally. In terms of these functions, ǫ = 1/√vh and
h/v. Using these functions the exact equations satisﬁed by F ± (r, t)

4 Concluding Remarks

We have been able to express the Maxwell equations in a matrix form in a
medium with varying permittivity ǫ(r, t) and permeability µ(r, t), in presence
of sources. We have been able to do so using a single equation instead of a
pair of matrix equations. We have used 8
8 matrices and have been able
to separate the dependence of the coupling between the upper components
(Ψ+) and the lower components (Ψ−) through the two laboratory functions.
Moreover the exact matrix representation has an algebraic structure very
similar to the Dirac equation. We feel that this representation would be
more suitable for some of the studies related to the photon wave function.
This representation is the starting point for the exact formalism of Maxwell
optics [6]-[8]. This formalism provides a uniﬁed treatment of beam-optics
and polarization.

We demonstrate that non-magnetic (µ ≡ 1) left-handed materials can be eﬀectively used for
waveguide imaging systems. We also propose a speciﬁc THz realization of the non-magnetic left-
handed material based on homogeneous, naturally-occurring media.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The materials with negative refractive index [1] (also known as left-handed media, LHM) have attracted a great
deal of attention during recent years [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, despite numerous eﬀorts to bring LHMs
to optical or even THz domain [12, 13, 14], all modern realizations of these fascinating systems are limited to GHz
waveguides[7, 9, 15, 16].

LHMs associated with materials with simultaneously negative values of dielectric constant ǫ and magnetic perme-
ability µ, are typically based on several interconnected resonant structures. A fraction of these resonators is used
to achieve negative dipole response, while others provide negative magnetic response [7, 16]. This basic LHM de-
sign however immediately leads to two problems. First, high-Q resonators needed in this approach, require extreme
fabrication accuracy and uniformity across the the system – something which is currently unachievable on a mass-
production scale. Furthermore, the operation in a proximity of any resonance is typically accompanied by strong
resonant absorption – with the resulting loss of resolution [17].

An alternative approach of using photonic crystals to achieve a negative phase velocity [8], besides being sensitive
to minute defects in the actual fabricated structure, typically yields direction-dispersive index of refraction with
corresponding deterioration of optical properties.

A new approach to obtain a left-handed response has been recently proposed in Ref. [18]. In contrast to the resonant-
based systems described above, the proposed material is non-magnetic (i.e. µ ≡ 1), with the negative-n response
achieved in a waveguide conﬁguration with anisotropic dielectric core. In this work we study the imaging properties
of these non-magnetic LHMs, and propose their THz realization based on a homogeneous, naturally occurring material.

II. WAVE PROPAGATION AND IMAGING IN NON-MAGNETIC LHMS

The proposed system is schematically shown in Fig. 1. It is represented by a planar (capacitor-type) waveguide
with metal walls and anisotropic core. The dielectric constant of the core material is assumed to be uniaxial, with
anisotropy axis perpendicular to the waveguide walls.

An arbitrary electromagnetic wave propagating inside this system can be expressed in terms of its normal modes.
Each of these modes is characterized by its polarization (with either electric [TE] or magnetic [TM] vector in the
waveguide plane) and by its structure in x (transverse) direction [19]. As it has been shown in Ref. [18], the propagation
of a mode in the proposed system is mathematically equivalent to propagation of a plane wave in an isotropic medium
governed by the free-space-like dispersion relation

Imaging using the proposed non-magnetic LHM system: the electric ﬁeld component Dz is plotted; the left-handed
material is extended from z/λ = 2 to z/λ = 6; (left): imaging through the ǫ−ν matched system [ǫRHM = −ǫLHM = 1/2; νRHM =

where kz and ky are the propagation components of the wavevector of the mode, ω is its frequency, ǫ is equal to ǫ⊥
for TM modes and to ǫ|| for the TE ones, ν = 1 − c2κ2
ǫ||ω2 , and mode parameter κ is deﬁned solely by the mode structure
in x direction.

The eﬀective refractive index of the waveguide system is given by n2 = ǫν. Thus, in order for the proposed planar
system to support a propagating mode, the corresponding parameters ǫ and ν have to be of the same sign. The
case of ǫ > 0; ν > 0 is typically realized in the planar systems with isotropic dielectric core [20] and corresponds to
the “normal” (“right-handed”) propagation. However, in contrast to this behavior, the case ǫ < 0, ν < 0 describes
transparent structure with negative refractive index [18]. In such system – similarly to the conventional (ǫ, µ) LHMs
– all phenomena directly related to phase velocity (e.g. Snell’s law) are reversed. In particular, the planar slab of a
non-magnetic LHM can be used to image objects within the waveguide.

Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrates such imaging process. To generate the data for these ﬁgures, we numerically solved
Maxwell equations in the proposed system. In our numerical simulations we assumed a single-mode excitation with
κ = k/2. Since the main focus of this paper is on THz perspectives of LHMs, we further assumed the waveguide walls
to have inﬁnite conductivity.

In these simulations, a source of EM radiation was located at the origin (inside the RHM part of the structure), and
its radiated wave was represented as a series of propagating TM modes with the same frequency and mode parameter
κ. We then determined the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients for each radiation component at front (z = 2λ)
and back (z = 6λ) interfaces of the LHM insert, and computed the EM ﬁeld throughout the system.

The corresponding panels of Figs. 2 and 3 represent the same imaging processes, but show either the value of the
z component of the ﬁeld (Fig. 2) or the total intensity at a given point (Fig. 3). The three diﬀerent panels in each of
these ﬁgures represent three principally diﬀerent cases: (i) the case of complete ǫ − ν match between LHM and RHM
region [panel (a)], (ii) the case when RHM and LHM structures have the same refraction index, but the constitutive
parameters are not matched [panel (b)], and (iii) the case when no parameters matched [panel (c)]. In each of the
cases we can identify the formation of two images by an LHM slab – the ﬁrst image is formed inside the left-handed
structure, while the second one appears in the right “right-handed” system. Note that the mismatch between the
refractive index of right- and left-handed media in our case does not lead to a signiﬁcant deterioration of the image
quality.

We also point out that if the source is positioned inside the LHM structure, one can eﬀectively obtain two images on
both sides of LHM region. This particular application may be useful for lasers based on sub-wavelength waveguides.

III. HOMOGENEOUS NON-MAGNETIC LHMS

As we discussed earlier, the realization of the non-magnetic left-handed materials requires a strongly anisotropic

of the realizations of this non-magnetic LHM system. Note that while no natural material having simultaneously
negative ǫ and µ have been found so far, the materials with strongly anisotropic eﬀective mass do exist – such as e.g.
monocrystalline bismuth.

The high-frequency dielectric constant of a (semi-)conductor material containing the substantial amount of free
electrons or holes is typically dominated by the dynamics of these free charge carriers. The resulting response is
plasma-like, and with the dielectric constant being adequately described by the Drude model[20]:

where ǫ0 is the (frequency-independent) contribution of the bound electrons, Γ describes inelastic processes, and the
plasma frequency ωp deﬁned solely by free-charge-carrier concentration N and eﬀective mass meﬀ

Two points can be immediately derived from the Eqs. (2-III). First, the eﬀective dielectric constant changes
sign when the excitation frequency crosses the plasma frequency [21]. Second, the anisotropy of the eﬀective mass
immediately leads to the anisotropy of the plasma frequency, and correspondingly, to the anisotropy of the dielectric
constant.
It is therefore possible to achieve the desired strongly anisotropic dielectric constant provided that the
material has strongly anisotropic eﬀective carrier mass, and the operating frequency is between the plasma frequencies
corresponding to the diﬀerent eﬀective mass directions.

We now illustrate the above considerations using the example of thin monocrystalline bismuth ﬁlm, with the trigonal
axis (C3) perpendicular to the ﬁlm surface. The strong anisotropy of the eﬀective masses of the electrons and halls in
this semimetal (by a factor of up to ∼ 100 for the electron pockets), leads to diﬀerent values of the plasma frequency
depending on the direction of the electric ﬁeld. In particular, for our conﬁguration the experimental data of Ref. [22]
yield ωp;⊥ = 187cm−1 and ωp;|| = 158cm−1. Therefore, for the frequencies ωp;|| < ω < ωp;⊥ (corresponding to THz
domain) ǫ⊥ < 0; ǫ|| > 0 (see Fig. 4).

Another exciting property of left-handed system based on bismuth ﬁlm is the extremely low material loss. In fact,
the losses in Bi are so small that already in 1960s, bismuth mono-crystalline systems could yield the carrier mean free
path at liquid helium temperatures on the order of millimeters - see e.g. Refs. [23]. As a result, the typical imaginary
part of the dielectric constant of Bi can reach the values on the order of 10−6 (see Fig. 4). Such a low loss is extremely
advantageous for imaging and transmission applications [17].

Fig. 5 demonstrates the refraction of a wavepacket incident onto the Bi-based LHM system from a conventional

waveguide .

show the direction of the propagation of the incident (red), refracted (green) and reﬂected beams (blue). The medium on the
left side of the boundary is an isotropic dielectric with ǫ = 55; the medium on the right side is monocrystalline bismuth; the
whole system is in a metallic waveguide with the thickness of d = 4.5µm, and the (free space) wavelength is λ = 61µm.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have studied the imaging properties of the recently proposed non-magnetic negative-n materials.
We have demonstrated that these systems can be eﬀectively used for imaging, and that refraction index or dielectric
constant matching are not critical for the system performance.

We have also proposed homogeneous, ultra low-loss, naturally occurring material (Bi ﬁlm) with the strong anisotropy

of the dielectric constant required for construction of non-magnetic LHMs, for THz frequencies.

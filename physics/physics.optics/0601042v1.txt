We present an analytic theory for the optical properties of ellipsoidal plasmonic particles covered
by anisotropic molecular layers. The theory is applied to the case of a prolate spheroid covered
by chromophores oriented parallel and perpendicular to the metal surface. For the case that the
molecular layer resonance frequency is close to being degenerate with one of the particle plasmon
resonances strong hybridization between the two resonances occur. Approximate analytic expres-
sions for the hybridized resonance frequencies, their extinction cross section peak heights and widths
are derived. The strength of the molecular - plasmon interaction is found to be strongly dependent
on molecular orientation and suggest that this sensitivity could be the basis for novel nanoparticle
based bio/chemo-sensing applications.

INTRODUCTION

The recent decade has witnessed extensive research
eﬀorts directed at localized surface plasmons (LSP’s),
i.e resonant charge-density oscillations conﬁned to sub-
wavelength metal structures, such as particles1, holes2,
shells3 or rods4. LSP’s are important because they lead
to strongly enhanced optical absorption and scattering
cross-sections, and because they readily couple to op-
tical far-ﬁelds, unlike the ordinary surface plasmons of
In the small particle regime,
extended metal surfaces.
the LSP resonance wavelengths of a single nanostruc-
ture are uniquely determined by its shape and dielectric
function, and by the optical constants of the embedding
medium. Thus, the color of the nanostructure can be
tuned over an extended wavelength-range, including most
of the visible and infrared regions in the case of silver
or gold structures, through a variation in shape. More-
over, the color can be used to ”sense” the optical proper-
ties of the surrounding. In addition, excitation of LSP’s
leads to strongly enhanced and localized ﬁelds in certain
regions near the metal surface, and these ﬁelds can be
used to amplify various molecular cross-sections. A bi-
sphere system, for example, support resonances for which
the ﬁeld is concentrated to the gap between the spheres,
which is crucial for single-molecule surface-enhanced Ra-
man scattering (SERS)5, and a sharp point or protru-
sion support LSP-enhanced ﬁelds at its apex, which can
be utilized for various types of near-ﬁeld microscopy6.
Sensing applications rely on the fact that it is only the
optical properties of the material within the zone of high
ﬁeld-enhancement that strongly aﬀect the LSP resonance

condition.7 The LSP spectrum, which can be measured
through far-ﬁeld extinction or Rayleigh scattering spec-
troscopy, can therefore be used for ultrasensitive sensing
applications aimed, for example, at quantifying various
biomolecular recognition reactions.8,9

As is known from a range of experiments and cal-
culations on nanostructured or ﬂat metal surfaces cov-
ered with chromophores, such as dye molecules, the in-
teraction between a plasmonic structure and its dielec-
tric environment can be very strong if the dielectric
possesses an optical resonance that is degenerate with
a surface plasmon resonance mode.10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17
This strong coupling also forms the basis for impor-
tant applications in molecular spectroscopy, in particular
surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS)
and surface-enhanced ﬂuorescence.18,19,20 For atoms and
molecules conﬁned in microcavities similar strong cou-
pling can occur.21,22 In many applications, it is advanta-
geous to bind the molecular layer to the metal via speciﬁc
functional groups, for example thiols, in which case the
molecular transition dipole moment will have a more or
less well-deﬁned orientation relative to the local ﬁelds
generated at plasmon resonance. This will in turn aﬀect
the degree of coupling between a molecular resonance and
a plasmon.

In this work, we present an analytical theory for calcu-
lating the optical properties of a sub-wavelength metal-
lic ellipsoid, the prototypical example of a nanostruc-
ture supporting tunable LSP’s, covered by an optically
anisotropic molecular layer. We then utilize this for-
malism for investigating strong coupling eﬀects in nano-
plasmonics. The quasi-static theory of dipolar plasmons
for ellipsoids has played an important role in nano-optics,

as it can be used to model a wide range of nanoparti-
cle shapes of practical interest, including rods, spheres,
oblate and prolate particles, accessing a broad range of
frequencies. The extension of this theory to ellipsoidal
cores with anisotropic coatings means that it is now pos-
sible to also investigate the eﬀect of molecular orientation
relative to the core surface.

II. THEORY

While the polarizability of a metallic particle with and
without coating has been studied in the past, and can
be found in text books, to our knowledge, the eﬀect of
anisotropy, i.e., molecular orientation, has not been an-
alyzed earlier in the context of plasmonics. Here, we
recapitulate recent analytic results23,24 for the dipolar
polarizability of an ellipsoid with an anisotropic coating
(the coating dielectric function being diﬀerent parallel
and perpendicular to the coating normal, see Fig. 1a),
and combine these results with realistic microscopic di-
electric functions for the metallic nanoparticle and the
coating.

The system we have in mind is depicted in Fig. 1a:
We consider a coated ellipsoidal particle in an exter-
nal electric ﬁeld ~E0, with ﬁeld-component E0v in the
v-direction (v = x, y, z). The frequency of the exter-
nal ﬁeld is ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light and
λ is the wavelength. The principal semiaxes of the inner
and outer ellipsoids are av and bv with ax ≥

(see Ref. 24). The “material” properties of the coated
nanoparticle enters through the relevant dielectric func-
tions: We denote the dielectric function of the inner el-
lipsoid by εin(ω). The coating has dielectric function
εck(ω) in the normal direction and εc⊥(ω) in the tangen-
tial direction. The dielectric function of the surrounding
medium is assumed to be real and frequency independent
and is denoted by εm. The entities above completely de-
termine the electromagnetic response of a coated ellip-
soidal particle, i.e., determine, for instance, the particle
polarizability αvv and the electric ﬁeld distribution in
and around the coated ellipsoid.23,24

εck(ω), εc⊥(ω) and εm are also indicated. b) Extinction spec-
trum, where σvv = ωℑ[αvv], v = x, y, z. The dash-dotted
curves are for an uncoated metallic ellipsoid, where the red
(blue) curve is for the external ﬁeld along the x-axis (z-axis).
The red solid (x-direction) and blue solid (z-direction) curves
correspond to the case of an ellipsoidal molecular layer (with-
out an interior metallic region, i.e. we set ǫi = 1) with a
resonance parallel to the layer normal. Here, this situation
is modeled by taking γ0k/v0 = 0.2, γ∞k/v0 = 0.02, and
γ0⊥/v0 = γ∞⊥/v0 = 0.01 (corresponding to eﬀective oscilla-
tor strength c0k ≈ 2.26, and large frequency refractive index
nk ≈ 1.06, see text). The red dashed (x-direction) and blue
dashed (z-direction) curves are for the case that the molecular
layer has a resonance perpendicular to the layer normal. We
take γ0⊥/v0 = 0.1 and γ∞⊥/v0 = γ0k/v0 = γ∞k/v0 = 0.01
(so that c0⊥ ≈ 1.13 and n⊥ ≈ 1.07). The following parame-
ters were used: e2
o = 0.8, s = 1, ∆V = 0.08, Γp/ωp = 0.05,
ω0k/ωp = ω0⊥/ωp = 0.5, Γk/ωp = Γ⊥/ωp = 0.03 and εm = 1.
The extinction cross-sections are shown in units of the total
volume Vo. The solid and dashed vertical bars indicate the
plasmon and molecular resonance frequencies, respectively.
Notice the small peak heights of the molecular layer reso-
nances (here enlarged by a factor 50) compared with the plas-
mon resonance heights.

metallic nanoparticle we must proceed by incorporating
realistic microscopic dielectric functions for the coating
and metal into the expression (3) for the dipolar particle
polarizability.

Let us consider the interior metallic region. In a stan-
dard fashion we assume that the dielectric function of the
metal is described by a Drude function:

with ωp being the plasmon frequency, Γp is a phenomeno-
logical damping parameter and ε∞ is the dielectric func-

this study. An uncoated metallic ellipsoidal particle in
vacuum (ǫm = 1) has dipolar plasmon resonance frequen-
cies

We now give the dielectric function of the coating; we
assume that the coating consists of molecules with dipo-
lar polarizabilities which are diagonal but with diﬀerent
components in normal and tangential directions; we de-
note the polarizabilities by γk (γ⊥), [where a subscript
⊥
) denotes polarizability component perpendicular (par-
(

and γ⊥ to the dielectric functions εck(ω) and εc⊥(ω) ap-
pearing in coated ellipsoid polarizability αvv: assuming
that the surface is locally ﬂat, and imposing the con-
ditions that the normal component of the total macro-
scopic electric ﬁeld and the tangential component of the
displacements ﬁeld are continuous across the surface sep-
arating the molecular coating from the surrounding, we
straightforwardly arrive at the following relation between
the molecular polarizabilities and the coating dielectric

nk = εck(ω =

out that the induced dipole coupling between molecules
(and image dipoles in the metal) in general, introduce
extra anisotropy by renormalizing the resonance frequen-
cies, static polarizabilities, large frequency polarizabili-
ties and damping parameters compared to their “bare”
values,24,30,31 and all such anisotropies are included in
the expression (9).

To summarize, the general procedure for obtaining
the polarizability αvv(ω) (v = x, y, z) for an ellipsoidal
metallic nanoparticle coated with an anisotropic molecu-
lar layer is: Consider a nanoparticle with principal semi-
axes ax, ay, and az. The size of the molecules together
with these nanoparticle principal semiaxes determine the
outer principal semiaxes bx, by and bz, see Fig. 1. From
these six principal semiaxes one calculates the the total
volume Vo, and the shape parameters s, e2
o (for small
coating thickness e2
o are related through the rel-
ative coating thickness ∆V ). The problem is completed
by specifying the metallic nanoparticle parameters in Eq.
(6), and the renormalized polarizability parameters of
Eq. (9); alternatively, one may use experimental results
for the nanoparticle and coating dielectric functions. Fi-
nally, the parameters above are used in the expression
for αvv(ω) explicitly given in Eq. (3).

i , e2

For the case where the coating resonance frequency
ω0µ is close to being degenerate with one of the parti-
cle plasmon resonances (i.e., ωpv of Eq. (7)) one expect
hybridization between the two resonances.3 In order to
address this point we proceed by ﬁnding an approximate
expression for the resonance frequencies for αvv(ω). As-
1, and utilizing the near
suming a thin coating ∆V ≪
resonance approximation (the large u-result23,24) we ob-
tain a simpliﬁed form for αvv, as detailed in appendix A.
Below we use this αvv for obtaining approximate expres-
sions for the coupled (hybridized) resonance frequencies
and for the extinction peak height at these resonances.
The damping constants associated with the hybridized
resonances are given in Eq. (A28). We point out the the
approximate expressions for αvv given in appendix A are
useful for investigating other quantities as well.

The resonance frequencies are obtained by ﬁnding the
poles of αvv; using the results in the appendix we ﬁnd
that resonances occur at frequencies ω = ω±

Ref. 3). The strength of the molecular-plasmon interac-
tion is characterized by the polarization and molecular

the molecular response properties through c0µ, as well as
on diﬀerent geometric quantities.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS.

ℑ

In the following, we illustrate the electromagnetic re-
sponse properties of a coated metallic nanoparticle via
the extinction cross-section σvv = ω
[αvv] for the case of
a prolate (ay = az, i.e. s = 1, “cigar-shaped”) spheroid.
We consider two diﬀerent situations: the case when the
molecules in the coating have their “resonant” axes (i)
parallel and (ii) perpendicular to the surface normal. The
polarizability component along the resonant axis is αk in
case (i) and α⊥ = αk/2 in case (ii), which corresponds to
coatings with identical but diﬀerently oriented molecules.
For each of the two cases, the external ﬁeld ~E0 is applied
either along the long axis (x-axis) or the short axis (y-
or z-axis).

In Fig. 1b, the polarization averaged extinction cross-
section for an uncoated metallic spheroid is shown to-
gether with the cross-section for an spheroidally shaped
molecular layer without an interior nanoparticle and with
the resonant transition dipole moments oriented in the
parallel and perpendicular directions. There are two
plasmon peaks, as expected for a spheroidal metal par-
ticle (two of the principal axes equal), with resonance
wavelengths to the red ( ~E0k
x-axis) and to the blue

(λ/λp = √3

ular layer is about 50 times weaker than the plasmons
for both molecular orientations. Notice that, for geomet-
ric reasons, the extinction peak height for the molecular
layer is smallest for the case where the external ﬁeld is in
the x-direction, with the molecules oriented in the par-
allel direction; see Ref. 24 for a thorough discussion on
geometric and molecular orientation dependent eﬀects in
the response of an ellipsoidal molecular layer. Also no-
tice the small diﬀerence in peak position between case (i)
1 there
and (ii); in Ref. 24 it was shown that for ∆V ≪
are no curvature induced shifts for the molecular layer
resonance frequencies (see also appendix A). Here, ∆V
is not suﬃciently small and there are some minor shifts
of the resonance frequencies.

In Fig. 2, we show extinction spectra corresponding to
the full coated spheroid response problem for the four
distinct cases mentioned above,
i.e molecular orienta-
tion perpendicular (a, b) or parallel (c, d) to the sur-
face normal and incident ﬁeld parallel to the short (a, c)
or the long (b, d) spheroid axes. The diﬀerent colors of
the curves corresponds to diﬀerent coating resonance fre-
quencies ω0µ. It is clear that there is strong hybridization
between the coating and plasmon resonances whenever
and v = x, y, z) in all cases. How-
ω0µ ≈
ever, the degree of hybridization diﬀers greatly between
the diﬀerent molecular orientations and polarization con-
ﬁgurations.

In order to investigate the peak height of the reso-

vµ (deﬁned in Eq. (A7)) compared to the scaled peak
height Tvµ(εi = 1) for a molecular layer (obtained from
Fig. 1), for diﬀerent coating resonance frequencies. A
comparison to the result given in Eq. (17) is also made.
We notice the two coupled resonances obtain similar peak
height as ω0µ approaches the particle plasmon frequency
ωpv. We also point out that the approximate expression
Eq. (17) works surprisingly well, considering that it is
based on a close to resonance and thin coating approxi-
mation, even far oﬀ the resonances.

When the molecular resonance is far above or far be-
low a plasmon resonance, we have a situation that can
best be described as surface-enhanced absorption from
the molecular layer18, i.e the magnitude of the molecu-
lar resonance peak is greatly enhanced but its position
and width is not changed dramatically from the case of a
”free” molecular layer, see Figs 2 and 3. In this regime,
the particle plasmons (at λpv, with v = x, y, z) become
either red-shifted or blue-shifted relative to the uncoated
metallic spheroid resonance wavelength depending on the
molecular resonance wavelength λ0. Interestingly, the en-
hanced absorption from the molecular layer is not sym-
metric on the two sides of the plasmon. This can be
seen when comparing Fig. 2 a) and c) (see also Fig. 3),
corresponding to polarization along the short axis of the
spheroid. When the molecular resonance is far to the red
of the plasmon, absorption enhancement is seen for the

The spectrum is in units of the total volume Vo of the coated
spheroid. σµ
vv = ωℑ[αvv], (µ = k, ⊥ and v = x, z) and
λ = 2πc/ω is the wavelength of the external electromagnetic
ﬁeld. a) The external ﬁeld is along the z-axis (short axis) of
the spheroid. The molecules have their resonant axes perpen-
dicular to the metallic particle normal; b) the external ﬁeld
along the x-axis (long axis), and the molecules are perpendic-
ular to the layer normal; c) the ﬁeld is along the z-axis, and
the molecules have their resonant axis parallel to the layer
normal; d) the ﬁeld is along the x-axis, and the molecules
are oriented parallel to the layer normal. The diﬀerent col-
ors are spectrum for diﬀerent molecular resonant wavelengths;
the upper vertical bars indicate these resonance wavelengths
λ0µ = 2πc/ω0µ. Here, we chose the following values for ω0µ:

given in the text right after Eq. (17). The solid and dashed

units.

vµ)/(Vo(ω±

eters used here) occur to the red of the plasmon for the
parallel case with the incident ﬁeld along the x-axis.

The diﬀerences above can be understood as follows: To
the red of a plasmon resonance, the induced ﬁeld from
the particle is in phase with the applied ﬁeld and nor-
mal to the surface at the poles of the particle (where the
poles are deﬁned by the direction of the induced dipole),
resulting in enhanced absorption from molecules oriented

parallel the surface normal. Molecules with the perpen-
dicular orientation instead couple mainly to the total ﬁeld
around the equator of the particle, where the ﬁeld is per-
pendicular to the surface normal. But to the red this
ﬁeld is weak, because here the induced ﬁeld is out-of-
phase with the applied ﬁeld. Hence, there is very little
enhanced absorption to the red of the plasmon in Fig 2
a) but a large enhancement in Fig. 2 c). The same type
of arguments apply to the case when the molecular reso-
nance is to the blue of the plasmon, but here the situation
becomes reversed because the induced particle dipole is
out-of-phase with the incident ﬁeld.35

The case when the molecular resonance is degenerate
with one of the plasmons corresponds to a regime that
can not be described in terms of enhanced absorption.
Instead, we have two completely hybridized resonances
that exhibit ”avoided crossing”, analogous to the case of
two strongly coupled (quantum or classical) harmonic os-
cillators, as is seen in Eq. (10). Fig. 4 illustrates this be-
havior for the two molecular orientations considered. In
the vocabulary of Ref. 3, the high frequency modes ω+
vµ
in Eq. (10) correspond to ”anti-bonding” combinations,
i.e. the case where the induced dipole on the particle is
out-of-phase with the molecular transition dipoles, while
the ”bonding” modes ω−
vµ corresponds to the case when
the excitations are in phase.
In a diabatic representa-
tion, this corresponds to Rabi oscillations in which the
excitation energy oscillates back and forth between the
plasmonic particle and the molecular layer. As can be
seen in Fig. 4, the mode splitting is much more signif-
icant when the molecular resonance is oriented parallel
to the surface normal (Fig. 4a) than for the perpendic-
ular case (Fig. 4b). This diﬀerence simply reﬂects the
predominant polarization of the local ﬁeld at the surface
(the ﬁeld would be strictly parallel to the surface normal
for a perfect conductor at zero frequency). We also note
that the splitting (expressed in frequency units) is larger
for the plasmon that corresponds to polarization along
the short axis of the prolate spheroid for both molecular
orientations, which is somewhat surprising considering
that the ﬁeld enhancement is highest at the sharp ends
of the spheroid.35 However, the coupling strength is de-
termined by the surface integrated local ﬁeld at the two
plasmon resonance frequencies, and for geometric reasons
this quantity is higher for the doubly-degenerate short-
axis plasmon in the present case.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no experimen-
tal studies that have directly probed the orientation de-
pendent plasmon-molecule coupling discussed here. How-
ever, the advanced nanofabrication and molecular func-
tionalization technologies of today clearly make such
studies a realistic possibility. One of the most interest-
ing options could be to use a plasmonic nanoparticle cov-
ered by an ordered layer of chromophores as a nanoscopic
bio/chemo sensor. For example, it can be expected that
the exact orientation of the chromophores on the sur-
face will be sensitive to pH and to the interaction with
molecules in solution. The chromophores might also be

molecules that change orientation/conformation upon
biorecognition reaction with an analyte. Such sensing
reactions would then aﬀect the coupling between the sur-
face plasmons and the chromophores, giving rice to pro-
nounced changes in the extinction or scattering spectrum
of the composite nanoparticle. To illustrate this possibil-
ity, Fig. 5 shows the diﬀerence spectra between the par-
allel and perpendicular orientations discussed above. As
expected, the diﬀerence is largest for molecular resonance
wavelengths that overlap the LSP modes. However, a
noticeable diﬀerence is observed even far oﬀ the plasmon

IV. SUMMARY

We have described an analytic method for calculating
the optical response of arbitrary ellipsoidal nanoparticles
with anisotropic molecular coatings in the small particle
limit and applied this theory to the case of a prolate metal
spheroid covered with chromophores. The results show
that the hybridization between the molecular resonance
and the localized plasmon resonances of the nanoparticle
is highly anisotropic. It is suggested that this sensitivity
can be utilized for novel bio/chemo sensing applications
that are based on molecular orientation rather than re-
fractive index contrast.

widths. It is convenient to deﬁne

Concluding, we above showed that close to one of the
resonances the polarizability can be approximated by a
Lorentzian, see Eqs. (A25), with a width determined by
Eq. (A28).

the following relation between the scaled peak height and

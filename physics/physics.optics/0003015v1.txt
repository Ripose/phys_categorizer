Abstract

We exhibit the strong inﬂuence on light propagation of the ﬁnite size in
photonic band-gap material. We show that light emission can be controlled
by the symmetry group of the boundary of the ﬁnite device. These results
lead simply to important practical applications.

Photonic crystals are expected to permit the realization of devices for integrated optics or
laser microcavities [1–5]. The today technology now authorizes the making of bidimensional
photonic crystals in the optical range [6]. From the theoretical point of view, there are
two ways for characterizing PBG materials. The ﬁrst way is the one commonly used in
solid state physics where pseudo-periodic boundary conditions are imposed leading to Bloch
waves theory. This is a powerful tool for the computation of the band structure of the
material [7]. However, this theory cannot be used when dealing with the scattering of an
electromagnetic wave by a ﬁnite device (which is the actual experimental situation) [8–10].
In that case, boundary eﬀects cannot be skipped and must be taken into account. In this
letter, we address the problem of the eﬀect on light propagation of both the symmetry group
of the lattice and the symmetry group of the boundary of a ﬁnite piece of the material. The
general study of the symmetry of the lattice modes has already been addressed in order to
understand the possible degeneracies and the existence of full band gaps [11–15]. Here, we
show that the ﬁnite size of the device strongly modiﬁes the behaviour of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, and that the symmetry of the boundary is a crucial parameter for the control of light
emission from PBG devices.

We deal with a bidimensional photonic crystal that is made of a ﬁnite collection of parallel
dielectric rods of circular section. The rods are settled according to a lattice with some
symmetry group GY (Y denotes the elementary cell) of the plane. The relative permittivity
of the lattice is a Y -periodic function εr (x, y). The rods are contained in a domain Ω, having
a symmetry group GΩ. As we deal with objects that are embebbed in an aﬃne euclidean
space, both groups must be given as subgoups of the group of plane isometries O (2), in a
canonical oriented basis. This is due to the fact that the use of the abstract groups does not
permit to distinguish between two isomorphic realizations. Indeed, using the abstract groups
and unspeciﬁed representations of degree 2, we could not, for instance, distinguish between
two squares C1,2 deduced from one another through a rotation r of angle π/4: denoting Γ1
a realization of D4 as an invariance group of C1, then Γ2 = rΓ1r−1 is a representation of C2

1

and therefore the equivalence class of Γ1 is not suﬃcient to compare the two ﬁgures and a
canonical basis has to be precised.
Denoting 1Ω the characteristic function of Ω (which is equal to 1 inside Ω and 0 elsewhere),
the relative permittivity is given by εΩ (x, y) = 1 + 1Ω (εr (x, y) − 1). Assuming a s-polarized
incident ﬁeld (electric ﬁeld parallel to the rods), the total electric ﬁeld veriﬁes the d’Alembert
equation:

c−2∂ttEz = ε−1

Ω ∆Ez

(1)

Our aim is to study the invariance of this equation under the action of the various groups
characterizing the geometry of the problem. For arbitrary cross-sections of the ﬁbers, we
should also introduce their symmetry group (for instance the group D4 for square rods). The
choice of circular rods simpliﬁes the study in that their symmetry group O (2) contains both
GY and GΩ. Note however that strong eﬀects can be obtained by using peculiar symmetries
of the rods, including the enlargment of the band gaps [16]. Let us now denote Γ (GY ) and
Γ (GΩ) the groups of operators associated to GY and GΩ respectively [17]. Both operators ∆
and ∂tt commute with Γ (GY ) and Γ (GΩ). However, due to the function εΩ, the propagation
equation is only invariant under the intersection group Γ (GY ) ∩Γ (GΩ). This simple remark
is a crucial point in understanding the invariant properties of ﬁnite crystals and it leads to
extremely important eﬀects in practical applications: it is a clue to controlling the directions
of light propagation in the structure. Indeed, due the boundary of Ω, the degree of the global
symmetry group of the device is reduced and consequently, from selection rules, the number
of forbidden directions increases.

In order to make this reasoning more explicit, we present two numerical experiments
obtained through a rigorous modal theory of diﬀraction [10,18] that takes into account all
of the multiple scattering between rods (in case of an inﬁnite lattice this is exactly the KKR
method), moreover it has been succesfully compared with experiments [19]. This method
allows to deal with ﬁnite structure without periodizing tricks [20] that may lead to spurious
phenomena [21]. As a lattice group GY , we choose the diedral group D6 [22], so that the
lattice has a hexagonal symmetry. The distance between neighbouring rods is denoted by
d. In order to create a defect mode in that structure, we open a microcavity at the centre
of the crystal by removing a rod (see [8,9,12,23,24] for studies of the properties of defects
in photonic crystals). A defect mode appears within the ﬁrst gap at a complex wavelength
λ/d = 2.264 + 0.06i (using a harmonic time-dependence of e−iωt). Such a structure can be
used as a resonator coupled to waveguides [14].

In the ﬁrst experiment, we choose the same group for the boundary as that of the lattice
(ﬁg.1)(i.e. GΩ = D6). In that case the propagation equation is completely invariant under
Γ (D6). We plot the map of the Poynting vector modulus associated to the defect mode (ﬁg.1)
and the radiation pattern is given in ﬁg.2. Clearly the ﬁeld shows a hexagonal symmetry,
which is obvious from the invariance of the d’Alembert equation. However, when designing
light emitting devices, one whishes to control the direction of light emission. In this example,
there are too many directions of emissions: such a device is to be coupled, for instance to
waveguides, and to get a good transmission ratio, one needs to concentrate the ﬁeld in a
few useful directions. As it has been stated above, the number of authorized directions can
be reduced by reducing the global symmetry group D6 of the device. This is what we do in
the next numerical experiment where we have changed the boundary so that it has now a

2

rectangular symmetry (GΩ = {e, sx, sy, r}, where s denotes a symmetry with respect to x
and y respectively and r is a rotation of angle π), the device is depicted in ﬁg. 3. In that
particular case, the group of the boundary is contained in the group D6. Then the equation
(1) is no longer invariant under Γ (D6) but solely under Γ (D6) ∩Γ (GΩ) = Γ (GΩ) which is
strictly contained in Γ (D6). All the other transformations are now forbidden. That way, we
expect a strong reduction of the directions of propagation of the ﬁeld.

Indeed, the map of the Poynting vector of the defect mode (ﬁg. 3) as well as the radiation
pattern (ﬁg. 4) shows a strong enhancement of the vertical direction by forbidding the
transverse directions linked to the rotations and the oblique symmetries. We have designed
a resonator that permits to couple the radiated ﬁeld in up and down directions with a better
eﬃciency.

It should be noted that a group theoretic analysis gives only informations on the possi-
ble directions of emission, the actual directions on which the ﬁeld concentrates cannot be
obtained by this mean: a rigorous computation involving a ﬁnite structure is then needed.
Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that it was possible to strongly increase the eﬃciency of
resonators by simply taking into account the symmetry of the boundary of the device. This
remark can be used rather easily in experimental situations and could lead to a dramatic
enhancement of the output of PBG based devices.

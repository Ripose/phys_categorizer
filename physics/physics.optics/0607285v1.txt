Intense ultrashort electromagnetic pulses and the
equation of motion

Abstract

The equations of motion of charged particles under the inﬂuence of short

electromagnetic pulses are investigated. The subcycle regime is considered,
and the delta function approximation is applied. The eﬀects of the self force
are also considered, and the threshold where radiation becomes important is
discussed. A dimensionless parameter is deﬁned that signals the onset of
radiation reaction eﬀects.

Very short and even subcycle optical pulses have been gaining increasing

attention in recent years.[1] The theory of the interaction of short pulses with

charged particles has been studied in [2], [3] in one dimension. In three dimensions

the subcycle problem becomes more complicated, and contentious [5]-[9], and it has

also been studied in plasmas.[10] Often, as the pulses decrease in their temporal
span, the intensity rises correspondingly. In fact, intensities of 1022 W cm−2 have

been reached, and this number is expected to go even higher.[11] At such extreme

conditions, the radiation reaction force should be examined, and we will examine the

intensities and pulse durations where the onset of the self force becomes important.

To begin, a nonrelativistic approximation is used to assess the use of a delta

function to model a short pulse. It is shown to be in agreement with the exact

solution of a Gaussian pulse, the approximation improving as the Gaussian pulse

becomes smaller. It is then shown how the delta approximation works for the

relativistic case, and ﬁnally, self force eﬀects are considered.

For a short pulse the slowly varying envelope approximation fails, and for a

subcycle pulse the whole notion of a wave train is derailed. Opposite the limit of a

monochromatic wave sits a delta function, and in the following we examine the

usefulness of this, other extreme, approximation. The value of this approximation

lies in the following observation. As the pulse becomes ever smaller, the exact pulse

shape may not be known exactly, and furthermore, sometimes the detailed motion

during the ﬂeeting moment of interaction is not of interest anyway, where the ﬁnal

velocity and energy are of more interest.

The most drastic approximation to be made is the one dimensional model,

meaning that the pulse, or waveform is of the form f (z

ct), i.e., the plane wave

−

approximation (although not necessarily a wave). Real pulses are focused down in a

variety of ways and, regardless of how they are made, the ﬁeld is a function of all of

the coordinates. This has been discussed extensively in the references given above.

Nevertheless, there are times when the 1-D approximation is useful and sheds light

on the more exact physics. This is one of those cases, where we are able to examine

both the delta function approximation and self force eﬀects with relative ease.

For example, consider Gaussian pulse. Non-dimensionalized units are used

where z/L

where w is a dimensionless parameter ﬁxing the width of the pulse. This must be

accompanied by a magnetic ﬁeld

E = Ee−((z−t)/w)2 ˆx

B = Ee−((z−t)/w)2 ˆy.

For nonrelativistic dynamics one may ignore the magnetic ﬁeld and integrate

F = ma = qE, for a particle with charge q and mass m. It is helpful to deﬁne the

impulse by

I =

F dt = qEwL√π/c.

Figure 1: mv/I vs t for w = 1, 1/2, 1/4, showing that the smaller w is, the more
steplike is the response.

This shows that replacing the Gaussian by a delta function reproduces the

solution of the equation of motion in the limit of a narrow pulse. In the limit that

w

0 these results show that the Dirac approximation precisely coincides with the

→

exact result given by the Gaussian approximation. In reality, short pulses have a

complicated proﬁle, but these results show the advantage of the delta function

approach: It changes the problem from solving a diﬀerential equation to an

algebraic equation.

To consider the relativistic situation consider the equation of motion

t it satisﬁes the wave equation, which also follows from the fact

We consider an electromagnetic wave of the form

and

This represents a plane wave of amplitude E, polarized in the x direction, described

by any dimensionless function f . With this (7) gives,

where the dimensionless parameter a = eLE/(mc2).

As these equations stand, the delta function approximation fails. This is

because, since the velocity is like a step function function, the integral of (13), for
example, is diﬃcult to assess.2 A better way to proceed is to note that (10) and (13)

imply,

which leaves the pair

θ(t)δ(t) = 1/2. Since v1 is not exactly a step function, this result is inapplicable

as well.

a fascinating result. It states that the x component of the four velocity is essentially

equal to the nonrelativistic three velocity evaluated at the proper time τ . With this,

(14), and (17), the relativistic solution is completely determined in terms of the

nonrelativistic solution for an arbitray 1D wave form f (z

particular this is valid for a >> 1. For example, at I = 1019 W cm−2 the diﬀerence

Having an analytical expression for the velocity is useful for looking at the

self force. The equation of motion with radiation reaction forces is 3

where the dimensionless parameter b

cτ0/L, τ0 = 2q2/(3mc3) and the overdots

imply diﬀerentiation with respect to the proper time. This is called the Lorentz

Abraham Dirac equation, but the other form of the equation of motion is obtained

by starting with (22) but using

which is called the Landau Lifshitz Rohrlich equation. The LAD equation fell under

bad times to the the runaway solutions, preaceleration issues, or the apparent need

to invoke non-zero size particles,[12] while the LLR equations seems to be only an

approximation. For a nice introduction to the issues, with historical notes, one may

consult Rohrlich[13], which has many of the seminal references and discusses the

distinction between “self forces” and “radiation reaction forces.” More recent work

considers the problem in various dimensions,[14][15] the eﬀect of the magnetic

dipole,[16][17], connections to QED[18] and vacuum polarization,[20], mass

conversion[19], and hydrogenic orbits.[21]

Whenever b is small, which is true for all but the most extreme light, it is

sensible to expand the solution in terms of this parameter,

where 0vσ is the solution without self forces, 1vσ is

(b), and so on. Then, for the

plane polarized ﬁeld used above we have,

expect, the eﬀect of the radiation reaction is to reduce the ﬁnal velocity of the

results diverge drastically, as expected.4

the case that Ω = 1 = w at 1023W cm−2. This is just below the radiation reaction

“threshold,” but it is interesting to see how strongly relativisitic the solution is.

This is evident in Figs. 6 and 7, which show the four velocity as a function of proper

time and the corresponding velocity (dz/dt) versus t.

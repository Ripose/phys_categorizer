The existence of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of light waves by subwavelength
slits in metal ﬁlms [for example, see T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667 (1998) and
H.J. Lezec et al., Science, 297, 820 (2002)] leads to the basic question: Can a light be enhanced and
simultaneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit? To address this question, the
spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of an ultrashort (femtosecond) wave-packet diﬀracted by a
subwavelength (nanometer-size) slit was analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the
Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution of Maxwell’s equations. The results show that a light can be enhanced
by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm-
and fs-scales. Possible applications in nanophotonics are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade nanostructured optical elements based on scattering of light waves by subwavelength-size metal
objects, such as particles and screen holes, have been investigated, intensively. The most impressive features of
the optical elements are resonant enhancement and spatial localization of optical ﬁelds by the excitation of electron
waves in the metal (for an example see, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25]). Recently, some nanostructures namely a single subwavelength slit, a grating with subwavevelength
slits and a subwavelength slit surrounded by parallel deep and narrow grooves attracted a particular attention of
researchers. The study of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of waves in close proximity to a single
subwavelength slit acting as a microscope probe [1, 2, 3] was connected with developing near-ﬁeld scanning microwave
and optical microscopes with subwavelength resolution [4, 5, 6, 7]. The resonant transmission of light by a grating with
subwavevelength slits and a subwavelength slit surrounded by grooves is an important eﬀect for nanophotonics [8, 9,
10, 11]. The transmissitivity, on the resonance, can be orders of magnitude greater than out of the resonance. It was
understood that the enhancement eﬀect has a two-fold origin: First, the ﬁeld increases due to a pure geometrical reason,
the coupling of incident plane waves with waveguide mode resonances located in the slit, and further enhancement
arises due to excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons localized on both surfaces of the slit (grating) [10, 11, 12].
A dominant mechanism responsible for the extraordinary transmission is the resonant excitation of the waveguide
mode in the slit giving a Fabry-Perot like behavior [11]. In addition to the extraordinary transmission, a series of
parallel grooves surrounding a nanometer-size slit can produce a micrometer-size beam that spreads to an angle of
only few degrees [9]. The light collimation, in this case, is achieved by the excitation of coupled surface plasmon
polaritons in the grooves [12]. At appropriate conditions, a single subwavelength slit ﬂanked by a ﬁnite array of
grooves can act as a ”lens” focusing a light [13]. It should be noted, in this connection, that the diﬀractive spreading
of a beam can be reduced also by using a structured aperture or an eﬀective nanolens formed by self-similar linear
chain of metal nanospheres [14, 15].

New aspects of the problem of resonantly enhanced transmission and collimation of light are revealed when the
nanostructures are illuminated by an ultra-short (fs) light pulse [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. For instance, in the study
[16], the unique possibility of concentrating the energy of an ultrafast excitation of an ”engineered” or a random
nanosystems in a small part of the whole system by means of phase modulation of the exciting fs-pulse was predicted.
The study [17] theoretically demonstrated the feasibility of nm-scale localization and distortion-free transmission of fs
visible pulses by a single metal slit, and further suggested the feasibility of simultaneous super resolution in space and
time of the near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The quasi-diﬀraction-free optics based on transmission
of pulses by a subwavelength nano-slit has been suggested to extended the operation principle of a 2-D NSOM to
the ”not-too-distant” ﬁeld regime (up to 0.5 wavelength) [18]. Some interesting eﬀects namely the pulse delay and

long leaving resonant excitations of electromagnetic ﬁelds in the resonant-transition gratings were recently described
in the studies [19, 20].

The great interest to resonant enhanced transmission, spatial localization (collimation) of continuous waves and
light pulses by subwavelength metal slits leads to the basic question: Can a light be enhanced and simultaneously
localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit? If the ﬁeld enhancement can be achieved together with nm-scale
spatial and fs-scale temporal localizations, this could greatly increase a potential of the nanoslit systems in high-
resolution applications, especially in near-ﬁeld scanning microscopy and spectroscopy. In the present article we test
whether the resonant enhancement could only be obtained at the expense of the spatial and temporal broadening of
a light wavepacket. To address this question, the spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of an ultrashort (fs) pulse
diﬀracted by a subwavelength (nanosized) slit in a thick metal ﬁlm of perfect conductivity will be analyzed by using
the conventional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution of Maxwell’s equations. In short, we ﬁrst will
describe the theoretical development of Neerhoﬀ and Mur (Section 2) and the model will then be used to calculate the
spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of the transmitted pulse (wavepacket) under various regimes of the near-ﬁeld
diﬀraction (Section 3). We will show that a light can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized
in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales. The implications of the results for diﬀraction-unlimited
near- and far-ﬁeld optics will then be discussed. In Section 4 we summarize results and present conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

An adequate description of transmission a light by a subwavelength nano-sized slit in a thick metal ﬁlm requires
solution of Maxwell’s equations with complicated boundary conditions. The light-slit interaction problem even for a
continuous wave can be solved only by extended two-dimensional (x, z) numerical computations. The tree-dimensional
(x, z, t) character of the pulse-slit interaction makes the numerical analysis even more diﬃcult. Let us consider the
near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of an ultrashort pulse (wave-packet) by a subwavelength slit in a thick metal screen of perfect
conductivity by using the conventional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ and Mur solution of Maxwell’s equations.
Before presenting a treatment of the problem for a wave-packet, we brieﬂy describe the Neerhoﬀ and Mur formulation
[1, 3] for a continuous wave (a Fourier ω-component of a wave-packet). The transmission of a plane continuous
wave through a slit (waveguide) of width 2a in a perfectly conducting screen of thickness b is considered. The slit is
illuminated by a normally incident plane wave under TM polarization (magnetic-ﬁeld vector parallel to the slit), as
shown in Fig. 1. The magnetic ﬁeld of the wave is assumed to be time harmonic and constant in the y direction:

The electric ﬁeld of the wave is found from the scalar ﬁeld U (x, z) using Maxwell’s equations:

~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x, z)exp(

iωt)~ey.

Notice that the restrictions in Eq. 1 reduce the diﬀraction problem to one involving a single scalar ﬁeld U (x, z) in two
dimensions. The ﬁeld is represented by Uj(x, z) (j=1,2,3 in each of the three regions I, II and III). The ﬁeld satisﬁes
the Helmholtz equation:

where j = 1, 2, 3. In region I, the ﬁeld U1(x, z) is decomposed into three components:

U d describes the diﬀracted ﬁeld in region I due to the presence of the slit. With the above set of equations and
standard boundary conditions for a perfectly conducting screen, a unique solution exists for the diﬀraction problem.

Let us now consider the diﬀraction of an ultra-short pulse (wave packet). The magnetic ﬁeld of the incident pulse

is assumed to be Gaussian-shaped in time and both polarized and constant in the y direction:

where τ is the pulse duration and ω0 = 2πc/λ0 is the central frequency. The pulse can be composed in the wave-packet

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the diﬀracted pulse are found by using the expressions (1-32) for each ω-Fourier
component of the wave-packet (34). This algorithm is implemented numerically by using the discrete fast fourier
transform (FFT) instead of the integral (34). The spectral interval [ωmin, ωmax] and the sampling points ωi are
optimized by matching the FFT result to the original function (33).

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we test weather a light pulse can be resonantly enhanced and simultaneously localized in space and
time by a subwavelength nano-sized metal slit. To address this question, the spatial distribution of the energy ﬂux of
the transmitted pulse under various regimes of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction is analyzed numerically. The electric ~E and
magnetic ~H ﬁelds of the transmitted pulse in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone are computed by solving the equations (1-
32) for each Fourier ω-component of the wave-packet (34). The amplitude of a FFT ω-component of the wave-packet
transmitted through the slit depends on the wavelength λ = 2πc/ω. Owing to the dispersion, the Fourier spectra
of the transmitted wave-packet changes leading to modiﬁcation of the pulse width and duration. The dispersion
of a continuous wave is usually described by the normalized transmission coeﬃcient Tcw(λ), which is calculated by
integrating the normalized energy ﬂux Sz/Si
z over the slit value [1, 3]:

where Si
z is the energy ﬂux of the incident wave of unit amplitude; Sz is the transmitted ﬂux. In order to establish
guidelines for the results of our numerical analysis, we computed the transmission coeﬃcient Tcw(λ, a, b) for a con-
tinuous wave (ω-Fourier component) as a function of screen thickness b and/or wavelength λ for diﬀerent values of
slit width 2a. Throughout the computations, the magnitude of the incident magnetic ﬁeld was assumed to be equal
to 1. As an example, the dependence Tcw = Tcw(b) computed for the wavelength λ=800 nm and the slit width 2a =
25 nm is shown in Fig. 2. The dispersion Tcw = Tcw(λ) for 2a = 25 nm and diﬀerent values of the screen thickness
b is presented in Fig. 3. In Fig. 2, we note the transmission resonances of λ/2 periodicity with the peak heights
λ/2πa at the resonances. Notice, that the resonance positions and the peak heights are in agreement with the
Tcw≈
results [2, 3]. The dispersion Tcw = Tcw(λ) (curves A and B) presented in Fig. 3 indicates the wave-slit interaction
behavior, which is similar to those of a Fabry-Perot resonator. The transmission resonance peaks, however, have a
systematic shift towards longer wavelengths. Our computations showed that the peak heights at the main (strongest)

dence indicates that the optical transmission of a time-harmonic continuous wave can be enhanced by several orders
of magnitude by decreasing the slit width and increasing the wavelength. Notice, that the Fabry-Perot like behaviour
of the transmission coeﬃcient is in agreement with analytical and experimental results published earlier [21, 22].

The existence of transmission resonances for Fourier’s ω-components of a wave-packet leads to the question: What
eﬀect the resonant enhancement has on the spatial and temporal localization of a light pulse? Presumably, the high
transmission at resonance occurs when the system eﬃciently channels Fourier’s components of the wave-packet from
a wide area through the slit. At resonance, one might assume that if the energy ﬂow is symmetric about the screen,
the pulse width and duration should increase very rapidly past the screen. Thus the large pulse strength associated
with resonance could only be obtained at the expense of the spatial and temporal broadening of the wave-packet.
To test this hypothesis, the spatial distributions of the energy ﬂux of a transmitted wave-packet were computed for
diﬀerent slit thickness corresponding to the resonance and anti-resonance position. As an example, Figs. 4 (a) and 5
(a) show the energy ﬂux of the anti-resonantly transmitted pulses. Figures 4 (b) and 5 (b) correspond to the case of
the waveguide-mode resonance in the slit. Figures 4 and 5 show the transmitted pulses at the distances
= a/2 and
a, respectively. The comparison of the ﬂux distribution presented in Fig. 4 (a) with those of Fig. 4(b) shows that, for
the parameter values adopted, a transmitted wavepacket is enhanced by one order of magnitude and simultaneously
localized in the 25-nm and 100-fs domains of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone. Thus at the distance
= a/2, the slit
resonantly enhances the intensity of the pulse without its spatial and temporal broadening. The result can be easily
understood by considering the dispersion properties of the slit. For the screen thickness b = 200 nm, the amplitudes
of Fourier’s components of the wave-packet, whose central wavelength λ0 is detuned from the main (at 500 nm)
resonance, are practically unchanged in the wavelength region near 800 nm (see, curve B in Fig. 3). This provides
the dispersion- and distortion-free non-resonant transmission of the wave-packet (Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)). In the case of
the thicker screen (b = 350 nm), the slit transmission experiences strong mode-coupling regime at the wavelengths
near to 800 nm (see, curve A of Fig. 3) that leads to a profound and uniform enhancement of amplitudes all of the
Fourier ω-components of the wave-packet (see curve C in Fig. 3). Thus, the slit resonantly enhances by one order
of magnitude the intensity of the pulse without its spatial and temporal broadenings (Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)). Also,
notice that at the distance
= a (Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)), both the resonantly and anti-resonantly transmitted pulses
experience natural spatial broadening in the transverse direction, while their durations are practically unchanged.

By comparing the data for anti-resonant and resonant transmissions presented in Figs. 4 and 5 one can see that
at the appropriate values of the distance
and the wave-packet spectral width ∆ω the resonance eﬀect does not
inﬂuence the spatial and temporal localization of the wave-packet. To verify this somewhat unexpected result, the
FWHMs of the transmitted pulse in the transverse and longitudinal directions were calculated for diﬀerent values

transmission condition ∆ωp < 0.1∆ωr (here, ∆ωr is the resonance spectral width), the transmitted pulse indeed does
not experience temporal broadening. Thus the temporal localization associated with the duration τ of the incident
pulse remains practically unchanged under the transmission. The value of τ is determined by the dispersion-free
1/∆ωp > 1/0.1∆ωr, where ∆ωr = ∆ωr(a) practically does not depend on the screen thickness b. We

enhanced by a factor λR
0 /2πa and simultaneously localized in the time domain at the τ = τ (a) scale. It was also seen
that the FWHM of the transmitted pulse in the transverse direction depends on the wave-packet central wavelength
λ0 and the distance z from the slit. Nevertheless, the FWHM of the transmitted pulse can be always reduced to the
= a/2, in the case of Fig. 4).

Thus high transmission can be achieved without concurrent loss in the degree of temporal and spatial localizations of
the pulse. In retrospect, this result is reasonable, since the symmetry of the problem for a time-harmonic continuous
wave (Fourier’s ω-component of a wave-packet) is disrupted by the presence of the initial and reﬂected ﬁelds in
addition to the diﬀracted ﬁeld on one side (Eq. 6). As the thickness changes, the ﬁeld U d and U3 change only in
magnitude, but the ﬁeld U1 changes in distribution as well since it involves the sum of U d with unchanging ﬁelds U i
and U r. At resonance, the distribution of U1 leads to channeling of the radiation, but the distribution of U3 remains
unaﬀected. By the appropriate adjusting the slit-pulse parameters a light can be enhanced by orders of magnitude
and simultaneously localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales.

The limitations of the above analysis must be considered before the results are used for a particular experimental
device. The resonant enhancement with simultaneous nm-scale spatial and fs-scale temporal localizations of a light
by a subwavelength metal nano-slit is a consequence of the assumption of the screen perfect conductivity. The slit
can be made of perfectly conductive (at low temperatures) materials. In the context of current technology, however,
the use of conventional materials like metal ﬁlms at a room temperature is more practical. As a general criterion,
the perfect conductivity assumption should remain valid as far as the slit width and the screen thickness exceed the
extinction length for the Fourier ω-components of a wavepacket within the metal. The light intensity decays in the
metal screen at the rate of Is = I0exp(
b/δ), where δ = δ(λ) is the extinction length in the screen. The aluminum has
the largest opacity (δ < 11 nm) in the spectral region λ > 100 nm [20]. The extinction length increases from 11 to 220
nm with decreasing the wavelength from 100 to 50 nm. Hence, the perfect conductivity is a very good approximation
in a situation involving a relatively thick (b > 25 nm) aluminum screen and a wave-packet of the duration τ
1/∆ωp
having the Fourier components in the spectral region λ > 100 nm. However, in the case of thinner screens, shorter
pulses and smaller central wavelengths of wave-packets, the metal ﬁlms are not completely opaque. This would reduce
a value of spatial localization of a pulse due to passage of the light through the screen in the region away from the
slit. Moreover, the phase shifts of the Fourier components along the propagation path causing by the skin eﬀect can
modify the enhancement coeﬃcient and temporal localization properties of the slit.

The above analysis is directly applicable to the two-dimensional near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy and spec-
troscopy. In a conventional 2D NSOM, a subwavelength (2a < λ) slit illuminated by a continuous wave is used as a
near-feld (
< a) light source providing the nm-scale resolution in space [4, 5, 6, 7]. The non-resonant transmission
z
|
of fs pulses could provide the super resolution of NSOM simultaneously in space and time [17, 18]. The above-
described resonantly enhanced transmission together with nm- and fs-scale localizations in the space and time of a
pulse could greatly increase a potential of the near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy, especially in
high-resolution applications. It should be noted in this connection that the high transmission (Tcw(λR
λR
0 /2πa)
of a pulse can be achieved without concurrent loss in the temporal and spatial localizations of the pulse only at the
short (
(a)) distances from the slit. The presence of a microscopic sample (a molecule, for example) placed
z

|
at the short distance in strong interaction with NSOM slit, however, modiﬁes the boundary conditions. In the case
<< 0.1a, the response function ac-
of the strong slit-sample-pulse interaction, which takes place at the distance
counting for the modiﬁcation of the quantum mechanical behavior of the sample should be took into consideration.
The potential applications of the eﬀect of the resonantly enhanced transmission together with nm-scale and fs-scale
localizations of a pulse are not limited to near-ﬁeld microscopy and spectroscopy. Broadly speaking, the eﬀect con-
cerns all physical phenomena and photonic applications involving a transmission of light by a single subwavelength
nano-slit, a grating with subwavevelength slits and a subwavelength slit surrounded by parallel grooves (see, the
studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and references therein). For
instance, the eﬀect could be used for sensors, communications, optical switching devices and microscopes.

IV. CONCLUSION

7

In conclusion, in the present article we have considered a question weather a light can be enhanced and simul-
taneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength metal nano-slit. To address this question, the spatial
distributions of the energy ﬂux of an ultrashort (fs) pulse diﬀracted by a subwavelength (nanosized) slit in a thick
metal screen of perfect conductivity have been analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the Neerhoﬀ
and Mur solution of Maxwell’s equations. The analysis of the spatial distributions for various regimes of the near-ﬁeld
diﬀraction demonstrated that the energy ﬂux of a wavepacket can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simulta-
neously localized in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales. The extraordinary transmission, together
with the nm-scale and fs-scale localizations of a light, make the nano-slit structures attractive for many photonic
purposes, such as sensors, communications, optical switching devices and NSOM. We also believe that the addressing
of the above-mentioned basic question gains insight into the physics of near-ﬁeld resonant diﬀraction.

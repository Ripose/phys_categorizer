Abstract

We consider the wave and ray dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in
a parabolic dome microcavity. The structure of the fundamental s-wave
involves a main lobe in which the electromagnetic ﬁeld is conﬁned around
the focal point in an eﬀective volume of the order of a cubic wavelength,
while the modes with ﬁnite angular momentum have a structure that
avoids the focal area and have correspondingly larger eﬀective volume.

The ray dynamics indicate that the fundamental s-wave is robust with
respect to small geometrical deformations of the cavity, while the higher
order modes are unstable giving rise to optical chaos. We discuss the
incidence of these results on the modiﬁcation of the spontaneous emission
dynamics of an emitter placed in such a parabolic dome microcavity.

Introduction

The miniaturization of optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes or
semiconductor lasers, is expected to lead to an improvement of their energy
eﬃciency and to a lowering of the lasing threshold. This tendency towards
miniaturization has led to the exploration of optical microcavities whose dimen-
sions are of the order of a few wavelengths [1]. In such microcavities the extreme
conﬁnement of the electromagnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes the interaction of the active
medium with the radiation ﬁeld so that the process of spontaneous emission
is altered both in its spatial and its dynamical characteristics. Spontaneous
emission can thus be redirected, enhanced or inhibited in a way that may be
exploited for the operation of light-emitting diodes or lasers. A modiﬁcation
of the characteristics of spontaneous emission, such as its directionality or the
emission rate, has been shown for several microcavity designs such as for the

traditional Fabry-Perot planar cavities [2] and for disk-shaped [3] or spherical
[4] cavities displaying whispering gallery modes.

One of the key requirements for enhancing the dynamics of spontaneous
emission and reducing the laser threshold is that the electromagnetic ﬁeld at
the site of the emitting dipole should be enhanced inside the cavity with re-
spect to its value in free space. A class of resonators for which this can be
achieved very eﬃciently are confocal cavities: A few experiments with spheri-
cal confocal cavities [5], or semi-confocal microcavities [6] have been reported
already, in which signiﬁcant spontaneous emission modiﬁcation or extremely
low laser thresholds have been observed. Among the diﬀerent designs of con-
cave mirrors, parabolic mirrors have an important advantage in that their focal
point displays no astigmatism and is free from spherical aberrations. Basic ge-
ometric optic thus leads us to expect that double-parabolic confocal cavities or
plano-parabolic semi-confocal cavities should display a strong enhancement of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the focal point, and a concomitant
modiﬁcation of the emission characteristics of an active medium placed there.
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of microcavities formed by a
parabolic mirror at or close to the confocal condition. The study is motivated
by experimental work in which such a system has in fact been fabricated. The
experimental characterization of the modal structure and dynamics, being now
in progress, will be given in a separate publication [7]. Here, we brieﬂy describe
the experimental structure, in order to deﬁne the system for which our model
calculations are intended. We have fabricated a semi-confocal plano-parabolic
semiconductor microcavity (see Fig. 1) by etching an appropriately-prepared
GaAs wafer by a Focused Ion Beam [8] to produce a “hill” of cylindrical sym-
metry and parabolic vertical cross-section having a diameter of 7.2 µm and
a height of 1.8 µm (corresponding to optical lengths of respectively 27 λ and
6.75 λ for a wavelength (in vacuo) of 960 nm) which was subsequently covered
with a thin metallic layer of gold. This gold dome constituted thus a concave

sisting of parabolic gold mirror and a planar Bragg mirror placed at the focal

parabolic mirror with its focal point inside the GaAs substrate. At the base of
the parabolic hill, the wafer had a 6-period GaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror, closing
the semi-confocal cavity (see Fig. 2). This cavity is expected to possess a mode
in which the electric ﬁeld is strongly enhanced in the vicinity of the focal point,
so that a localized semiconductor emitter, such as a quantum box or quantum
well, emitting at a wavelength near 960 nm, will have its spontaneous emission
greatly enhanced when placed there. The use of a dielectric mirror with lower
refractive index rather than a metallic mirror at the focal plane is important
because it introduces a boundary condition that requires the tangential electric
ﬁeld to be maximal at the focal plane. This condition cannot be fulﬁlled on a
metallic mirror, on which the tangential electric ﬁeld should vanish, producing
thus a vanishing ﬁeld at the focal point of the parabola.

In order to understand the operation of such a cavity and to assess its per-
formance in modifying spontaneous emission, in this paper, we examine ﬁrst the
modal structure of an ideal confocal double-parabolic, or semi-confocal plano-
parabolic microcavity. We then investigate the stability of these modes with
respect to geometric deformations of the cavity that correspond to deviations
from confocality; this condition is inevitably violated in a realistic cavity due
to fabrication defects. The discussion of this case provides the conceptual and
theoretical background for the experimental analysis to be presented in a sub-
sequent paper.

The calculation of the modal structure of the parabolic dome microresonators
cannot be treated within the paraxial approximation of conventional [11] res-
onator theory, because of the very large aperture displayed by the parabola and
because the cavity dimensions are comparable with the optical wavelength. Ex-
tensions of the paraxial approximation to the highly convergent (or divergent)
beams produced by parabolic mirrors are cumbersome even in macroscopic res-
onators [9] where the optical axis is long compared with the wavelength – in
microresonators, the latter breaks down as well. However, there are other ap-
proximate techniques which are well-suited to the problem we consider. As
a valuable tool for simplifying the exact solution of Maxwell’s equations for
the cavity modes, we employ a short-wavelength approximation leading to sim-
ple WKB quantization conditions. The assumption that wavelengths are much

4

shorter than the relevant cavity dimensions is common to both WKB and parax-
ial approximation, and it is therefore at ﬁrst sight surprising that the WKB ap-
proach yields excellent quantitative agreement with the exact cavity spectrum
even for the longest-wavelength modes of the parabolic cavity. We show how
this arises by discussing in detail the structure of the classical ray dynamics in
the resonator which makes the WKB approximation possible. As a result, we
shall then also be able to assess the stability of the modal structure with regard
to fabrication imperfections, based on a ray analysis for parabolic cavities in
cases where confocality is violated. To characterize the modes of the parabolic
resonator, the internal caustic structure formed by the rays turns out to be of
crucial importance. These considerations establish a connection between the the
microcavity optics of the paraboloic dome and the ﬁeld of quantum chaos: even
minute deviations from confocality introduce chaos into the ray dynamics, and
we have to address the signiﬁcance of this eﬀect for the relevant cavity modes.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2, introduces the mathematical
model that describes confocal parabolic cavities, while Section 3 presents the
wave equation for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in cylindrical and parabolic coordi-
nates and discusses its exact vectorial and scalar solutions. Section 4 presents
the WKB approximation of the wave equations for the parabolic cavity, an ap-
proach that will permit us in Section 6 to make the connection with ray optics,
while Section 5 compares the numerical solutions of the wave equations in the
parabolic microcavity with those of the WKB approximation. Section 6 intro-
duces the main concepts of ray optics applied to our parabolic cavities with
cylindrical symmetry, while Section 7 analyzes the stability of the ray trajecto-
ries in a parabolic cavity in which there is a slight deviation from confocality.
Section 8 discusses the problem of the ﬁnite acceptance angle of Bragg mirrors,
a feature that limits the lifetime of modes in semiconfocal cavities bounded by
such mirrors. Finally, Section 9 summarizes the results of this study and gives
its conclusions.

2 The model

We consider a model structure for an ideal semi-confocal cavity which is bounded
by a metallic concave parabolic mirror on one side and a planar dielectric mirror
on the other side, placed at the focal plane of the parabola.

In cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z, φ) the parabolic mirror is given by

where f is the focal distance of the parabola, while the focal plane (and the
planar mirror) corresponds to

Figure 3: (a) Representation of parabolic cylinder coordinates in the z - ρ plane
of a cylindrical coordinate system (z is the vertical axis). The third dimension
is obtained by rotating the ﬁgure around ˆz by the angle φ. The point A is
speciﬁed by ξ = 1.3 f , η = 0.9 f and φ = 0. The focus of all parabolas is at
the origin. (b) By unfolding the parabolic dome into a double paraboloid, the
boundary conditions on the common focal plane can be restated as simple parity
requirement under reﬂection at this plane (z = 0). For TE modes, the electric
ﬁeld must be even under this reﬂection. The unfolded cavity is shown in side
view with meridians which make 90◦-corners at the focal plane. The latter is
also the equatorial plane of the cavity.

It is convenient to describe this cavity in parabolic coordinates (ξ, η, φ), whose
properties are summarized in the Appendix. For reference, we reproduce here
the transformation to cylindrical coordinates as given in Eq. (99):

To illustrate this coordinate system, we show in Fig. 3 (a) how the intersection
of the coordinate surfaces deﬁnes a point A in the plane z versus ρ. Also shown
is the cavity shape itself: the parabolic mirror corresponds to

ξ = 2 f,

(5)

In an ideal cavity, the parabolic metallic mirror can be assumed to be lossless,
displaying an amplitude reﬂectivity r = -1. This produces a π phase change upon
reﬂection so that it corresponds to a boundary condition in which the tangential
electric ﬁeld vanishes. In parabolic coordinates this can be expressed as

Eη(ξ = 2f ) = 0

Eφ(ξ = 2f ) = 0

Bξ(ξ = 2f ) = 0

(6)

Similarly, the planar dielectric mirror can be assumed to have a reﬂectivity of r =
+1, producing no phase change upon reﬂection so that the tangential magnetic
ﬁeld vanishes on the focal plane of the cavity. In cylindrical coordinates, this
can be expressed as

Bρ(z = 0) = Bφ(z = 0) = 0

and Ez(z = 0) = 0

(7)

6

Alternatively, this implies that the tangential electric ﬁeld is maximum on the
focal plane and is symmetric under reﬂection of the whole cavity at the z = 0
plane. Thus, instead of considering this plane as an additional boundary with
the properties (7), one can unfold the cavity across this plane by reﬂection, to
obtain a confocal double paraboloid shown in Fig. 3 (b). This extended cavity
requires only the metallic boundary conditions on its parabolic walls, that is
Eq. (6) and its equivalent in which ξ and η are interchanged. It will support
modes that can be either symmetric or antisymmetric under reﬂection at the
focal plane. If we restrict ourselves to modes in which Eρ and Eφ are symmetric,
this subset is identical to the modes of the original dome with the conditions of
Eqs. (6) and (7).

The advantage of considering the unfolded cavity is that the focal plane as a
physical boundary drops out of the discussion; this will considerably simplify the
interpretation in terms of the ray picture later on. Therefore, in the remainder
of this paper, we can refer to Fig. 3 (b) as our model system.

The boundary conditions and the constraint of zero divergence imposed on
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in general will lead to a coupling between the various
vectorial components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In simpler geometries
such as cylinders, spheres or rectangular cavities, a suitable choice of polariza-
tions reduces the problem to ﬁnding the eigensolutions of a scalar Helmholtz
equation [10]. However, in our case the three polarizations and the intersecting
parabolic surfaces forming the resonator cannot be labeled by the coordinate
lines of a single orthogonal coordinate system, as is possible in the textbook
systems mentioned. We discuss now the implications of this complication.

We note that the wave equation couples the radial and angular components of
the electric ﬁeld (Eρ and Eφ), while the equation for the axial component Ez is
scalar. One can achieve a further simpliﬁcation in this system of equations as
follows:

The rotational symmetry around the z axis permits us to assume a φ-

dependence of all components of the ﬁeld of the form

quantum number m = 0, this reduces to two identical equations. If, on the other
hand, m
= 0, we can form a suitable linear combination of Eρ and Eφ which
decouples these two equations. Naively setting Eφ = 0 would not achieve this
goal because it forces both ﬁeld components to vanish.

The proper linear combination in which to decouple this system of diﬀerential

However, this decoupling of polarizations in the wave equation does not
reduce the problem to a truly scalar one because the ﬁeld components are still
coupled by the boundary conditions and by the condition of zero divergence.

3.2 The absence of longitudinal electromagnetic modes

Unfortunately, the set of boundary conditions Eq. (16) is not yet a complete
list of constraints that we have to satisfy. An additional requirement is that
the ﬁeld at every point in the resonator has to have zero divergence, which in
parabolic coordinates reads

This assumption already entered the derivation of the system of wave equation,
Eq. (10), from the original Maxwell equations in the form of Eq. (8). However,
this does not guarantee that all solutions of Eq. (10) or Eq. (11) satisfy Eq.
(17). The latter is just the well-known statement that the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is purely transverse, ruling out longitudinal modes: the transverse electric ﬁeld

In view of the constraints imposed by the boundary conditions (16) and by
the zero divergence condition (17) it is not possible (except for the case m = 0,
as we shall see later) to set one (or two) of the vector components to zero without

9

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

setting the full electric ﬁeld identically to zero, and thus it is not possible to
reduce in a rigorous manner the vector problem into a scalar one.

The problem can in principle be solved by converting Eq. (17) from a condi-
tion in the cavity volume to a boundary condition which can then be treated on
the same footing as Eq. (16). One way of achieving this [12] is by noting that if

The latter is automatically divergence-free. In order for ~E to satisfy the bound-
ary condition ~Et = 0, we require for ~E0

on the boundary. The problem is therefore reduced to ﬁnding the auxiliary ﬁeld
~E0 and then deducing the transverse ﬁeld from Eq. (21). This leads to a system
of three second-order diﬀerential equations for each vector component of ~E0,
given by Eq. (11), all of which are coupled by boundary conditions that are,
however, quite complex.

The next step is then to write the ﬁeld components as linear combinations
of independent general solutions of Eq. (11) and determine the unknown coef-
ﬁcients in that expansion from the matching conditions at the boundary. The
solution proceeds in an analogous but much less tedious way if we neglect the ad-
ditional divergence condition. The important simpliﬁcation is that we are then
components of the electric ﬁeld independently,
able to consider the E+ and E
by setting all except for one component to zero. The boundary conditions (16)
are then decoupled as well. More precisely, it will be shown that the wave equa-
tions are then not only scalar but also separable, i.e., reducible to the solution
of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

−

We therefore would like to neglect the coupling that results from the condi-
tion of zero divergence, provided that this can be justiﬁed in the context of the
present study. There are various reasons why this approximation will provide
us with useful results. Foremost, it will turn out below that the most important
modes we ﬁnd in this way in fact conspire to satisfy Eq. (17) a posteriori, cf.
Section 3.5: the modes that provide the best conﬁnement of the ﬁeld in a tightly
focused region around the focal point are the ones with m = 0. For these, the

10

diﬀerent vector components decouple rigorously and the scalar program is exact.
These m = 0 modes are particularly signiﬁcant because they provide the best
conﬁnement of the ﬁeld in a tight focal volume. This is the paramount aim of
the experimental dome structure.

In addition to this exact result, the more transparent simpliﬁed problem
allows us to evaluate the stability of the stationary states of the ﬁeld in the
parabolic cavity with respect to deviations from the confocality condition – a
deformation that can readily occur in the course fabrication. This will be ad-
dressed with the help of the ray picture in Section 7, and the ray trajectories
themselves are independent of whether a vectorial or scalar ﬁeld is considered.
Since the exact nature of the deformation is unknown, it is necessary to make
model assumptions and parametrize the deformation in some way. Although
the range of possible behaviors explored within our model can be argued to
be generic, we lose at that point the ability to predict accuratey all the indi-
vidual modes of the speciﬁc sample. The error incurred by this fundamental
uncertainty about the precise boundary shape is larger than the error made by
adopting the simpliﬁed boundary conditions, and hence the latter are warranted
on physical grounds.

The consistency of these arguments is proven in Section 7 where we ﬁnd
that the only modes which can in fact be reliably predicted for a large range
of possible deformations (because they are structurally stable against the emer-
gence of chaos) are the ones with low m (or angular momentum in the classical
picture), concentrated strongly near the z-axis. For these modes one can set
approximately m

and Ez = 0 so that Eq. (17) becomes valid.

3.3 The wave equation in parabolic coordinates

Having discussed the boundary conditions, we now provide the solutions to Eq.
(15). In order to ﬁnd a system of general solutions to the formally scalar diﬀer-
ential equations, Eqs. (11 c) or (15), we express the scalar Laplacian appearing
there in parabolic coordinates (ξ, η, φ), leading to the form

when we transformed the vector ﬁeld components to cylindrical coordinates in
Eq. (11).

At this point we introduce the approximation of discarding the divergence
condition so that we merely have to consider the boundary conditions (16) with
one and only one of the three ﬁeld components nonzero. Then, Eq. (23) is
separable in η and ξ. We shall return to the details of the solution procedure
in Section 4; for now it is suﬃcient to give the result: Denoting the separation
constant by β, the solution can be written in the form

The set of curves parametrized by this constraint will intersect the curves deﬁned
by Eq. (29) at certain isolated points in the β - k plane. By ﬁnding these
intersection points, we determine the quantized values of β and k corresponding
to solutions of Eq. (23) which satisfy the boundary conditions. It is not clear
at this stage of the discussion how many intersections there are, or even how
the curves deﬁned by each equation separately will look. Before we analyze
the diﬀerent branches of these equations and identify their intersections based
on asymptotic methods in Section 4, it is useful to discuss in more detail the
consistency of the ﬁelds thus obtained.

3.4 Behavior at the focal point

±

The main experimental purpose of the cavity is to concentrate the ﬁeld near
the focus as much as possible. Since one always has Ez = 0 there, it remains
to discuss the behavior of E
in the focal region. Because of the “angular-
momentum-barrier” on the righthand side of Eq. (23), the solutions F given in
Eq. (27) attain a factor ξn/2 which suppresses the ﬁeld near the origin ξ = 0
when n
= 0. The Kummer function itself goes to M = 1 at ξ = 0, so that
the only way of getting a nonvanishing ﬁeld at the origin is to set n = 0 in
Eq. (26). This means that the angular momentum quantum number must in
fact satisfy m = 1 for E
1 for E+ according to Eq. (24). But this
or m =
leads to a contradiction:
if the ﬁeld is nonzero at the origin, then because of
iφ) one faces a singularity at ξ = η = 0 in which the
the azimuthal factor exp(
ﬁeld is indeterminate. Therefore, there is no possibility to obtain a nonzero ﬁeld
precisely at the focus of the cavity.

−

±

−

±

For m =

1 there are still solutions of Eq. (23), but they must involve
solutions of Eq. (23) in suitable linear combinations such as to yield a vanishing
ﬁeld at ξ = η = 0. We have the freedom to linearly combine eigenstates of
the wave equation at the same wavenumber k (yielding a stationary state with
monochromatic time dependence). First we use the real-valued solutions in Eq.
(27) to form a superposition of the type Eq. (30) with a plus sign. Despite its
symmetry it can also be made to vanish at ξ = η = 0, if one or both of the
functions F (k, β, ξ) and F (k,

β, η) are zero at the origin.

Although we can hence ﬁnd solutions for arbitrary m with a tangential elec-
tric ﬁeld that is symmetric under reﬂection at the focal plane, we can only
attempt to concentrate the ﬁeld near the focus, always with a node at the focal
= 0 by the phase singularity at the origin. For m = 0, there
point, dictated for m
is the residual angular momentum barrier due to n
= 0, and thus even in this
simple case – contrary to our expectation from quantum mechanical analogues
– the “s-wave” solutions have vanishing ﬁeld at the focus, as a consequence of
the vector nature of the ﬁeld.

3.5 Particular case: the fundamental s-wave

The case m = 0 can be discussed in more detail because it permits simple
analytical expressions for the wave solution, if we specialize further to β = 0.
In this case, the solutions in Eq. (27) simplify to

Eφ = Q = F (k, 0, ξ) F (k, 0, η)

(33)

as in Eq. (25). This already satisﬁes the condition of symmetry with respect
to the focal plane, without having to form a superposition of the type (30).
Moreover, it satisﬁes the condition of vanishing divergence, as can be checked
with Eq. (17).

By splitting the various terms appearing here into two contributions, the elec-

Here, we have used the substitution ρ = r sin θ in the denominators.

The ﬁrst ﬁeld, Eq. (39), corresponds to cylindrical standing waves with a
phase variation along the z direction, while the second ﬁeld, Eq. (40), cor-
responds to spherical standing waves with a phase variation along the radial
direction. This conﬁguration is reminiscent of what is expected from a simple
geometrical optics argument in which a ray bundle emerging from the focal point
can propagate outwards as a spherical wave, upon reﬂection on the parabola it
gets converted into a cylindrical wave, which in turn can counter-propagate back
to the focal point after being reﬂected on the planar mirror and a second time
on the parabola. In the unfolded double-paraboloid, the ray trajectories are of
the type shown in Fig. 4. It should be noted that these two partial waves are
not physical when taken individually, because in both cases the electric ﬁeld
diverges along the axis of the parabola. The divergence, however, cancels out
when the superposition of the two partial waves is considered. We have so far
only drawn this ray interpretation from a particular decomposition of the exact

15

solution; the question is how arbitrary that decomposition is and what we can
learn from it. This will be pursued in the following section. The actual intensity
distribution of these n = 1 states in the cavity will be plotted in Section 5.2
where we can compare their spatial patterns with those obtained for larger n,
in order to justify our claim that the s-wave modes provide the best focussing.

4 Finding the modes within the short-wavelength

approximation

Having seen that even the long-wavenlength s-wave in our cavity can be inter-
preted as standing waves arising from counterpropagating ray bundles and their
accompanying wavefronts, we now turn to a more quantitative eikonal analysis.
Such an analysis can provide accurate starting points for a numerical search of
the exact wave solutions, which are determined by ﬁnding intersection points
between the families of curves (29) and (31) in the plane of β vs. k. Such
semiclassical considerations based on the short-wavelength approximation are
an important ﬁrst step because there are, as we shall see, inﬁnitely many in-
tesections between the sets of curves determining the exact solutions, and one
desires a means of ﬁnding them in a systematic way, labeling them by “quantum
numbers”, giving the number of nodes in the ﬁeld along the coordinate lines for
ξ and η. Beyond this very practical use of the short-wavelength limit, we also
want to establish a physical understanding of the resonator modes that allows
us to predict how they depend on changes in the cavity shape. This aspect of
the ray picture will be expounded in the last section.

4.1 WKB approximation and eﬀective potential

The equation to be solved is Eq. (26), an ordinary second-order diﬀerential
equation, where the angular momentum m enters as a parameter trough the
constant n. We are looking for solutions F (ξ) which satisfy the boundary con-
dition F (2 f ) = 0 and are not singular at ξ = 0. The standard short-wavelength
approach to be employed here is the WKB approximation[14]. After division
by ξ, Eq. (26) takes the form

This has a form similar to the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation of quan-
tum mechanics, except for the ﬁrst u-derivative which makes the kinetic energy
operator non-selfadjoint. This term appears in the radial equation of cylin-
drically symmetric problems but does not aﬀect the applicability of the WKB
approximation [15].

The WKB solution requires us to ﬁnd the classical turning points in the
potential appearing in this equation, with Z playing the role of the total energy.

smoothly goes through zero as it changes sign, and hence the probability per
unit time of ﬁnding the particle becomes inﬁnite.
In the ray dynamics, this
phenomenon gives rise to a caustic. This will be discussed further in Section 6.
The outer turning point of this classical picture is determined by the Dirichlet
boundary condition at the parabolic mirror, which in the new coordinate is
located at

It is the boundary condition f (u1) = f (√2 kf) = 0 in which the short-wavelength

eter satisﬁes

i.e. this additional boundary is far away from the classical turning point u0 of
the eﬀective potential. All steps discussed above for f (ξ) apply analogously to

sign of Z everywhere and replace u by the variable

4.2 Quantization conditions

Under this condition, the semiclassical determination of the eigenfrequencies
proceeds by applying the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization to the action integral
for one period of the motion in the eﬀective potential. One round trip consists
of the path from u0 to u1 and back to u0. The quantized action is therefore

The integer ν = 0, 1 . . . is the number of nodes of the wavefunction in the
potential, and the constant 3/4 takes into account the phase shifts of π and
π/2, at the outer and inner turning points, respectively. In other words, the
above quantization condition is an approximate way of writing the phase-shift
requirements that hold at boundaries and caustics, using the approximation that
the wave propagation itself is described by a wavefront whose phase advance in
x is given by the function J.

This is an equation for the two unknowns Z and x, i.e. for the rescaled separation
constant and size parameter. It is therefore analogous to Eq. (29). The integer
ν uniquely labels all the allowed solutions fν of Eq. (44). This is an important
diﬀerence to Eq. (29): there, the function F in fact has inﬁnitely many branches
that satisfy the equation, which are however not labeled explicitly. The great
advantage of Eq. (53) is that these branches are explicitly enumerated by ν, so
that ﬁxing this index selects exactly one curve in the Z-x plane instead of an
inﬁnte family.

As in Eq. (25), the ﬁeld consists of products of the form

Q = fν(x, Z, u) fµ(x,

Z, v)

−

with v deﬁned as in Eq. (50). The two function fν and fµ have their analog in
the exact solutions F of Eq. (26), corresponding to the branches of F labeled
by ν and µ, respectively.

We then form combinations the form of Eq. (30) to enforce the required
symmetry with respect to the focal plane. The semiclassical WKB quantization
for the function fµ(x,

Z, v) provides a second equation of the form (53),

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

These two quantization conditions play the same role as Eqs. (29) and (31): the
intersections of the curves parametrized by them determine the quantized values
of Z and x. However, the WKB method aﬀords a great simpliﬁcation: by ﬁxing
the branches ν and µ, the intersection of the two resulting curves is uniquely
determined. To illustrate this situation, we show in Fig. 6 how the lines deﬁned
by the above two equations traverse the Z-x plane. Only a small portion of this
plane is shown, emphasizing the behavior of the semiclassical results at small
x where their accuracy should be at a minimum. Comparison with the exact
families of curves shows, however, that the WKB results are excellent even in this
long-wavelength limit. Note that by symmetry, intersections occurring at Z = 0
are always between curves with the same branch index ν = µ. All curves shift
to larger x with increasing n because of the larger centrifugal barrier, pushing
the classically allowed regions of the eﬀective potential in Fig. 5 outward.

The dashed black curves show the analogous graphical solution of Eqs. (29) and

for n = 0), attesting to the striking accuracy of the former even at the smallest
possible size parameters x. All plots can be continued to Z > 0 by reﬂecting at
the axis Z = 0. The WKB curves with positive slope belong to Eq. (55), the
falling lines are created by Eq. (53). They are labeled starting from the leftmost

5 Exact solution for the modes and their ﬁeld

distribution

Once the allowed combinations of Z and x – or equivalently β and k – at which
the boundary conditions are satisﬁed have been found, the problem of ﬁnding
the modes is solved. For example, we can now plot the intensity distribution of
each mode by using the quantized values of β and k in Eq. (27) and forming
the proper linear combinations of the form Eq. (30).

5.1 Mode proﬁles

This will now be carried out for the lowest-lying modes as obtained from the
intersections in Fig. 6. Any given value of n can have a diﬀerent meaning for
the intensity distribution in the azimuthal direction, depending on which case
in Eq. (24) we choose to consider: n = m
1 for the modes. Since the azimuthal
ﬁeld variation is trivial,
exp(imφ), we wish to restrict our attention to the
mode proﬁle in the plane spanned by ρ and z in cylindrical coordinates. The
variable governing this property is n, not m. Therefore, n is used here to classify
the mode proﬁles.

±

∝

As has been done in the previous sections, we shall take the focal plane to
be the symmetry plane of a double paraboloid, and plot the wave ﬁelds in this
unfolded cavity. This is done in view of the subsequent discussion, where we
shall establish the connection between these modes and the ray dynamics. Some
wave plots are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Note that the case n = 0 does not appear
among the solutions listed here because it corresponds to wave ﬁelds that do
not vanish on the z-axis and hence are irreconcilable with the ﬁnite angular
momentum m =

1, as discussed in section 3.4).

If we look at only the left column of Figs. 7 and 8, it is apparent that all

±

21

Figure 8: The modes shown here do not follow the simple law of Eq. (56) but
were obtained numerically. With increasing centrifugal barrier, labeled by n,
the forbidden region around the z-axis grows outward.

states with Z = 0 look similar, as do all states with Z
= 0. A similar observation
can be made in the right columns of the ﬁgures. Comparison to the intersecting
lines in the graphical solution, Fig. 6, shows that states with the same nodal
pattern indeed result from the crossing of the same pair of lines – labeled by
the same µ and ν, only for diﬀerent n which pushes the intersecting lines to
higher x. However, the interpretation of µ, ν as the number of nodes in the
parabolic coordinate directions cannot be carried through in all of the plots.
We will return to this problem in Section 5.3.

In order to achieve the best possible concentration of ﬁelds near the focus,
the most promising candidates are the modes with n = 1. Among these, the
patterns shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the states at Z = 0 in turn show the
highest intensity near the focal plane. These are precisely the fundamental s-
waves we discussed in Section 3.5, with the wavenumbers quantized according
to Eq. (36), which for the size parameter reads

xN = 2 knf = 2 π N.

(56)

This is an exact result which can be compared to the WKB quantization condi-
tion in Eq. (53) with Z = 0, n = 1. The latter actually has a more complicated
form,

1 + arcsin

= 2π (ν + 1),

but to second order in the small quantity 1/x this is identical to Eq. (56) with
N = ν + 1. This conﬁrms the observation made in Fig. 6 that the numeri-
cal agreement between exact and semiclassical solutions is good even for small
quantum numbers.

5.2 Focussing and the eﬀective mode volume

In order to evaluate the ﬁeld enhancement that is achieved in the fundamental
TE modes discussed in Section 3.5 and shown in Fig. 7, it is necessary to examine
the distribution of the electromagnetic energy in that mode. The energy in a
parabolic cavity of focal length f is

where the value of the integral can be evaluated numerically.

For the experimentally realized cavity described in Section 1, kf = 14 π
so that the value of the integral is 2.527. The intensity distribution for this
mode is shown at the bottom right of Fig. 7 (note x = 2 kf ). To examine the
energy distribution in the cavity, we can evaluate the energy that is contained
at each lobe of the standing wave of parabolic wavefront that corresponds to the
mode. We note then that the ﬁrst lobe, corresponding to a parabolic wavefront
of focal length f1 = λ/2, contains 48% of the total energy; to see this, replace
the integration limit in Eq. (59) by π. This lobe occupies a physical volume of
πλ3/4 whereas the volume of the overall cavity, V = 2π f 3, is 2744 times
V0 ≡
larger.

This underscores the very large conﬁnement of the ﬁeld that occurs in the
vicinity of the focal point and points to the possibility of observing a very large
enhancement of spontaneous emission into this mode. The fraction of the total
energy contained in the ﬁrst lobe of course reaches 100% if the smallest possible
cavity with k f = π is considered. However, the size achieved in our present
sample already approaches the optimal conditions if one takes into account that
enhancement of spontaneous emission requires not only a small eﬀective mode
volume but most of all a small local density of states [16]. The average density
of modes in an arbitrarily-shaped electromagnetic resonator of volume V is a

H. Weyl [19]:

indicating that the number of modes in the interval dk is proportional to the
number of additional volume quanta V0 that ﬁt into the given volume V when
k increases to k + dk. The local density of states in the focal volume V0 can
therefore be interpreted to be the same as the total density of states in a small
cavity of volume V = V0. This, in turn, is roughly the eﬀective mode volume
for the fundamental s-wave in our structure. ¿From this we conclude that the
spontaneous emission enhancement should be close to the maximum possible
value even though our cavity is not of the minimum possible size. This is one
of the central advantages we were looking for in the parabolic cavity design. In
this discussion we have assumed for simplicity that the Q-factor of the modes
under consideration is ﬁxed, independent of size and quantum numbers. This
severe simpliﬁcation will be removed in Section 8.

In the higher order modes with m > 0, the centrifugal barrier prevents the
ﬁeld from approaching the focal point. This implies that these modes will
have a larger eﬀective volume and, correspondingly, a smaller enhancement
of the spontaneous emission rate. An added diﬃculty concerning the higher
order modes arises from the limited experimental control over the exact cavity
shape. As discussed in Section 7, small deformations of the cavity (modeled as
deviations from confocality), result in chaos, leading to a loss of constraints on
the possible regions of phase space which can be explored. This further increases
the eﬀective volume of these modes. The enhanced spontaneous emission into
the fundamental s-wave implies that this mode will also exhibit a large gain
and, correspondingly, a low lasing threshold. The preliminary conclusion of this
section is therefore that a mode with low angular momentum and small Z (or
β) will be the dominant mode in a laser of parabolic geometry.

5.3 Caustic structure in the wave solutions

In order to arrive at the solutions shown in Fig. 8, we started from the semi-
classical (short-wavelength) approximation and then reﬁned the quantized Z
and k further by applying the exact modal conditions. However, the question
arises how the quantum numbers µ and ν which label the semiclassical solutions
can be visualized in Fig. 8. The answer is that the symmetrization procedure
obscures this identiﬁcation. What happens can be understood if we ignore the
parity requirement and plot the wave ﬁelds in the simple product form of Eq.
(25).

Figure 9: Mode intensities as in Fig. 8, but without performing the symmetriza-
tion prescribed by the focal plane boundary condition. The WKB quantum
numbers µ (and ν) can be read oﬀ by counting the number of wavefunction
nodes parallel (and perpendicular) to the reference line γ. Modes in the ﬁrst
three rows correspond to the symmetrized versions of Fig. 8. In order to illus-
trate the approach to the short-wavelength limit, additional modes are shown for
which the formation of caustics is apparent in the high-intensity ridges (black)
bordering the classically forbidden regions (white).

The symmetrization performed according to Eq. (30) with A = B intro-
duces no change whatsoever if the separation constant is β = 0. Therefore, the
intensity proﬁles of all modes with Z = 0 in Fig. 8 are the same before and
after symmetrization. However, the wave patterns acquire a qualitatively diﬀer-
ent and simpler form if we desymmetrize the remaining states. This is shown in
Fig. 9. The nodal patterns now appear in a regular fashion along the coordinate
lines for u and v (or ξ and η), and their number along these lines is uniquely
determined by µ and ν.

−

By symmetrizing a state such as the one shown for n = 3, k = 18.59 and
Z =
2.54 in Fig. 9, the ﬁeld shown in the desymmetrized plot is added to
its reﬂection at the focal plane, thus allowing some nodal lines to be “ﬁlled
in”, as seen in the corresponding state at the bottom right of Fig. 8. The
desymmetrized waves in Fig. 9 exhibit nodal lines precisely along lines of η =
const or ξ = const. In addition to the simple nodal structure, we also observe a
clear segregation between regions of negligible intensity and regions of oscillatory
ﬁeld, with dividing lines between them that become more and more pronounced

25

as the size parameter x = 2 k f increases. These are the caustics, which in fact
accumulate an increasing amount of intensity as the short-wavelength limit is
approached. The caustics follow parabolic coordinate lines as well, as is apparent
8.72 is bounded
from the last row of Fig. 9. The ﬁeld at n = 3, x = 34.16, Z =
from below by a broad inverted parabola, and excluded from the z-axis by a
steep upright parabola. The intersection of both parabolas forms the caustic. In
the mode at n = 4, x = 73.73, Z = 0, both the upright and inverted bounding
parabolas are symmetric as we expect for Z = 0.

6 Caustic structure in the ray picture

In this section we will elaborate on the relation between mode structure and ray
dynamics, as a basis on which we can predict the eﬀect of shape perturbations
on the mode structure. The caustic patterns revealed in the last section by the
decomposition into the product states as in Eq. (25) is a direct consequence of
the classical turning points in the eﬀective potential V , Eq. (45), for the motion
along the ξ and η directions. The distinction between classically allowed and
forbidden regions gives rise to the regions of oscillatory and vanishing ﬁelds in
Fig. 9. The eﬀective potential has, so far, been discussed only as an auxiliary
concept that proved convenient in the WKB treatment; its relation to the be-
havior of the rays of geometric optics is, however, well-known. For the sake of a
self-contained presentation, we convey here the idea behind the general eikonal
theory by showing how to derive ray equations from the one-dimensional sepa-
rated wave equations, Eq. (26). The argument is non-standard in the sense that
Eq. (26) is based on the full vectorial wave equation (i.e. with polarization),
and we therefore shall ﬁnd that for a given angular momentum m, slightly dif-
ferent ray trajectories have to be considered depending on polarization. This is
because the quantity entering Eq. (26) is n, not m.

6.1 Ray equations from the WKB approximation

Inserting the WKB ansatz, Eq. (46), into the wave equation for the separated
variables, Eq. (26), one ﬁnds to leading semiclassical order that p must satisfy
the equation

We can interpret this as the Hamiltonians of two decoupled linear systems, and
add them to obtain the Hamiltonian for the combined system,

The Hamiltonian in this form is analogous to the wave equation in parabolic
coordinates, Eq. (23), where the Laplacian is divided by the same scale factor
(u2 + v2) that accompanies the conjugate momenta here. One can now use

being

Here we used the deﬁnitions of the coordinates in Eqs. (3) and (42). To examine
what this equation has to do with the ray dynamics, we take the ray-picture
point of view now.

6.2 Geometric optics in cylindrical coordinates

If we consider the three-dimensional motion of rays in a double paraboloid of the
shape in Fig. 3 (b), their propagation between reﬂections at the parabolic walls
will of course follow straight lines, and hence there is no place for any coordinate-
dependent potential V . However, in order to compare the ray dynamics to
wavefunction plots in the z-ρ plane as shown in Fig. 9, we must project the
ray motion onto this plane as well. In the wave analysis, this projection was

27

achieved by using the rotational symmetry of the cavity around the z axis to
eliminate the azimuthal coordinate φ from the problem in favor of the angular
momentum quantum number m.

In ray optics, we can do the same: rays can be classiﬁed by an angular
momentum Lz because of the axial symmetry. To see this, we ﬁrst deﬁne Lz.
A ray trajectory is a curve consisting of straight line segments between each
reﬂection. If we parametrize this curve as r(l), where l is the path length along
= 1. Here and in the
the ray from some arbitrary starting point, then
following, the dot represents the diﬀerentiation with respect to arc length, d/dl.
In cylinder coordinates ρ, φ, z, we can decompose this as

˙r(l)
|
|

˙r = ˙ρ eρ + ˙z ez + r ˙φ eφ.

Between any two reﬂections, this is a constant unit vector in the direction of
the ray. With this, the equation for a straight line segment can be written in
general as

r

˙r

L,

≡
where L is a constant analogous to the angular momentum of classical mechan-
ics.

×

Because of the rotational symmetry around the z-axis, the azimuthal unit
vector eφ at the point of reﬂection is always tangent to the surface. Therefore, a
reﬂection does not change the component of ˙r along eφ, so that ρ ˙φ is continuous.
Since the ray curve is itself continuous everywhere, so is ρ(l). Hence the quantity

is also continuous at each reﬂection. But this is just the z-component of L in
Eq. (73), as can be veriﬁed by performing the cross product there. Thus, Lz is a
constant between reﬂections, which together with its overall continuity implies
that it is a conserved quantity for the whole ray trajectory.

Using Eq. (74), the fact that ˙r is a unit vector, Eq. (72), can be recast as

¿From the ray approach we have thus obtained an equation almost identical
to Eq. (71). We only have to re-deﬁne the path length variable l to make it
dimensionless, by introducing

Then Eqs. (71) and (75) become identical, if we interpret the dot in Eq. (71)
to mean d/ds. The scale factor of the “time” variable parametrizing our trajec-
tories is irrelevant for the shape of the paths, so that we can conclude that the
ray picture introduced here is equivalent to the motion described by the WKB
eﬀective potential, with the important identiﬁcation of Eq. (78).

Besides Eq. (75), the only other equation that is needed to completely de-
termine any ray trajectory from its initial conditions is the law of specular
reﬂection, which can be formulated with the help of the outward normal unit
vector u at the reﬂection point as

˙rref lected = ˙r

2 u (u

˙r).

−

·

(79)

This corresponds to a reversal of the normal component of ˙r. Here we can
see explicitly that reﬂections do not aﬀect the component of ˙r in the direction
of eφ, since the normal u has no eφ-component as a consequence of the axial
symmetry.

This latter fact also means that we can simply drop the eφ-component from
Eq. (79) altogether. Therefore, we now deﬁne the two-component vectors in
the z - ρ plane by dropping the eφ-components from the corresponding three-
component vectors. Thus, ˙r becomes

In this two-dimensional space, the specular-reﬂection condition retains the form
of Eq. (79),

This is the reason why we can call the motion in the z - ρ plane a billiard
problem.

6.3 Curved ray paths in the centrifugal billiard

We know that the trajectories between reﬂections are straight lines, so that the
components of ˙r in the cartesian coordinate frame are constant for each segment.
In our new z - ρ frame of reference, the z-axis is the same as the cartesian one,
so that we still have vz = ˙z = const between reﬂections in Eq. (80). However,
the same does not hold for the ρ-component of v. Instead, we obtain from Eq.

z/ρ2 in Eq. (75), and we would recover straight lines, i.e.

to ﬁnd that Eq. (85) describes a curved path ρ(z) in the z -ρ plane. The curved
nature of this trajectory is a direct consequence of the centrifugal potential
L2
linear variation of
ρ(l) for Lz = 0. This is why we refer to this problem as a centrifugal billiard [17].
For a visual example of how curved traces arise from stright-line trajectories,
the reader is referred to Fig. 13 (e) which will be discussed in Section 7.

An example of the ray motion in the special case Lz = 0 is already displayed
in Fig. 4, showing no curved trajectories because there the z - ρ plane is indis-
= 0, curved ray trajectories
tinguishable from the cartesian z - x plane. For Lz 6
in the z - ρ plane are shown in Fig. 10 for four diﬀerent initial conditions under
which the ray is launched. Note that the parameter Lz as given in the plot
has dimensions of length, cf. Eq. (75). This reduced two-dimensional problem
can be analyzed completely without reference to the original three-dimensional
ray tracing, with Lz as a parameter that encapsulates the third degree of free-
dom φ which has been eliminated. We have, broadly speaking, converted to a
co-rotating frame of reference (with rotation speed always matching the vary-
ing angular velocity of the ray), and thus obtained a planar problem in which
we now look for the classical orbits. The simpliﬁcation is considerable because
the three-dimensional ray motion in the cavity is rather diﬃcult to visualize,
compared to the motion in the z - ρ plane.

The two periodic orbits in Fig. 10 (a) exemplify this situation: after the
trajectory completes one round-trip in the z - ρ plane, it returns to its initial
position with the initial orientation – but in the original three-dimensional cavity
there has also been a motion in φ which does not necessarily amount to a full
rotation around the z axis. Hence, this periodic orbit of the centrifugal billiard
is not in general a true periodic orbit of the parabolic dome, cf. Fig. 13 (e).
However, we can reverse this statement and conclude that any periodic orbit of
the three-dimensional problem must also be periodic in the z - ρ plane. This
cautionary remark concerning the interpretation of Fig. 10 is relevant if we
attempt to interpret the actual modes of the original cavity in terms of a naive

30

Figure 10: All starting conditions for the rays in (a), (b) and (c) amount to the
same angular momentum, Lz = 0.1 f , but prescribe diﬀerent angles of incidence

shows a single path, which is quasi-periodic because it does not close on itself
even in this projection. Instead, it densely ﬁlls a region of space delimited by
a caustic whose shape is given by the parabolas (blue). The caustic becomes
more asymmetric in (c) and (d), each of which shows a quasiperiodic orbit.
The angular momentum in (d) is Lz = 0.6 f , leading to a larger forbidden zone
around the z - axis.

physical optics approach: one might think that a quantized mode has to be
associated with ray paths that form a closed loop and in that way “reproduce”
themselves. However, a comparison between Figs. 9 and 10 reveals that periodic
orbits seem to play no special role for the mode structure.

What shapes the modes is not any single periodic ray orbit, but the caustics
as they appear in Fig. 10 (b) - (d). The spatial distribution of the ray trajectories
exhibits a clear correspondence with the modal intensities shown in Fig. 9,
particularly in the shape of the caustics. This is most convincing for the two
examples in the bottom row of Fig. 9 where the wavelength is shortest: The
8.72 should be compared to Fig. 10 (c), and the
state at n = 3, x = 34.16, Z =
reﬂection-symmetric mode with n = 4, x = 73.73, Z = 0 ﬁnds its counterpart
in Fig. 10 (d).

−

Caustics are immediately generated when we follow a single quasiperiodic
orbit, but not so for a periodic one. However, periodic orbits occur in inﬁnte
families which, when plotted together, again ﬁll a region of space bounded by a
caustic curve. The two members of the family shown in Fig. 10 (a) are obtained
by launching a ray from the focal plane, perpendicular to it, diﬀering only in
the radial distance ρ of the launch. All other siblings of the examples in Fig. 10
(a) combined, would create a picture almost identical to the one generated by
the single quasiperiodic orbit in Fig. 10 (b) – the latter is in fact the result of
only a slight deviation from the initial conditions chosen in Fig. 10 (a), with the
result that the orbit almost, but not quite, closes on itself after one round trip,
and continues to fall short of closing itself after each subsequent round trip as
well. The conclusion is that from the point of view of the caustic structure in

31

our system, there is no qualitative diﬀerence between periodic and quasiperiodic
orbits.

The fact that all orbits can be characterized by a particular caustic which
they touch, and that moreover all periodic orbits come in inﬁnite families, is a
general property of integrable Hamiltonian systems, to which the special cen-
trifugal billiard deﬁned here belongs. That the paraboloid billiard is integrable,
can already be concluded from the existence of a separation ansatz for the wave
equation, which we discussed in Section 3. However, we have not yet completed
our program of connecting the ray and wave approaches, and in particular we
have not addressed the question of how to determine quantitatively the type of
ray trajectories that correspond to a given mode. So far, the correspondence
was established by visual inspection alone. The quantitative connection is ob-
tained by comparing the ray patterns of Fig. 10 with the eﬀective potential V
of Eq. (45). We shall see that for an integrable system, we can in fact uniquely
connect a particular caustic with a given mode.

As a ﬁnal remark concerning the periodic orbits in this integrable system,
it is worth comparing the patterns of Fig. 10 (a) and especially Fig. (4) with
the “bowtie laser” of Ref. [18]. There, a semiconductor cavity was designed in
such a way as to obtain lasing from a bowtie-shaped mode with highly desirable
properties, foremost among them its focussing action in the center of the cavity.
The focussing patterns of Fig. (4) are very similar, but the main diﬀerence is
that in our case these orbits occur in families whose members can cross the z = 0
plane with all possible axial displacements ρ. In the semiconductor cavity, most
rays move on chaotic trajectories, and only a small range of initial conditions
for the rays lead to a stable bowtie pattern, leading to modes which are strongly
concentrated near a unique bowtie path, and hence even less spread out in space
than the examples shown in Fig. 7. This leads us to anticipate that the beneﬁcial
properties of the n = 1 modes found for our integrable system can in fact be
enhanced if we allow for the possibility of chaos in the ray dynamics.

6.4 Connection with the eﬀective potential in parabolic

coordinates

The classical turning points for the two degrees of freedom u and v in the
potential of Eq. (45) determine the parabolas which describe the caustics in Fig.
10. We notice that the caustics (and also the quasiperiodic rays that generate
the caustics we show) have a well-deﬁned distance of closest approach ρ0 with
respect to the z axis, given by the corner at which the two bounding parabolas
meet. Describing this in parabolic coordinates, we ﬁnd that ρ0 is approached if
both ξ and η simultaneously reach their inner turning points. Expressing this
condition in terms of Eqs. (47) and (51), we obtain the simple semiclassical
relation

(87)

ρ0 =

n
k

.

32

Here, we have used the coordinate transformation ρ = √ξ η, cf. Eq. (3), and the
deﬁnition of the rescaled variables, Eq. (42).

The distance of closest approach for individual periodic orbits is not given
by this expression, but the minimal ρ over the whole family of such orbits does
follow this law. The caustics in Figs. 10 (b-d) exhibit cusp singularities at
ρ0 because in that extreme point the z motion has zero velocity:
it is clear
from Eq. (75) that the smallest ρ will be achieved when ˙ρ = ˙z = 0. But
from the same equation we immediately obtain that the angular momentum
then equals the axial distance, and with Eq. (87) this reproduces Eq. (78).
We have therefore established that the ray’s “angular momentum” is directly
proportional to the modiﬁed angular momentum quantum number n of the
mode under consideration. In the semiclassical limit of large k, the diﬀerence
1 and m becomes negligible in this expression, so that we
between n = m
recover the intuitively expected proportionality

±

m
k

.

(88)

Lz = ρ0 ≈
This approximation means that we can neglect the eﬀect of polarization on the
ray-wave correspondence in the semiclassical limit – however, we shall make use
of this only later, in the ray analysis of Section 7. Since we have been interested
in states at rather small k and in particular n
1, we have plotted in Fig. 10
only trajectories with Lz 6
A second semiclassical relation follows from Eqs. (47) and (51) if we ask for
the value z0 of z corresponding to the point u0, v0 at which the caustics have
their singularities. The whole caustic is uniquely determined by its singular
point at radial distance ρ0 and height z0, cf. Fig. 10. According to Eq. (3), we
get

= 0.

≥

z0 =

Z
2k

.

(89)

This identiﬁes the meaning of the separation constant Z, also quantifying the
earlier observation that for E = 0 both the wave and ray patterns are symmetric
with respect to the focal plane: in that case, the cusp occurs on this mirror plane,
as in Fig. 10 (b).

With Eqs. (78) and (89), we have completed the bridge from the exact wave
equation via semiclassical WKB quantization to the ray caustics. By specifying
the quantized n, Z and k of a given mode, we uniquely determine a caustic and
with it a particular family of ray paths. Now we can use additional properties
of the ray picture to better understand the cavity modes. This is especially
promising in this system because we have seen that the semiclassical approx-
imation is extremely accurate here. The reason for this somewhat surprising
accuracy lies itself in the properties of the ray dynamics, but in order to make
this clearer we need to introduce the concept of a phase space in which the ray
dynamics can be described.

33

6.5 Families of rays and Poincar´e sections

A phase-space description is often used in classical mechanics because it carries
more information about the possible trajectories than mere real-space diagrams.
This approach has recently been applied to the analysis of ray dynamics in
optical cavities as well [26, 27], with the goal of providing insights that are
not revealed by ray tracing in real space.
In particular for the treatment of
non-integrable resonator geometries, it has proved valuable to represent the
phase space of the rays in terms of Poincar´e Surfaces of Section (SOS). For our
purposes, the following SOS will be chosen:

It is easy to convince ourselves by recalling Fig. 3 that any ray trajectory in
the cavity has to encounter the focal plane inﬁnitely many times as it propagates.
However, the radial distance of these crossings, as well as the value of ˙ρ may
vary from one crossing of this plane to the next. Now we can consider

˙ρ

(90)

ρ and pρ ≡
as a pair of canonically conjugate position and momentum variables, and at-
tempt to image the subset of phase space spanned by them.
In order to do
that, we launch a ray trajectory and follow it for many crossings of z = 0, each
time recording the instantaneous values of ρ, pρ as a point in a two-dimensional
graph. The result is shown in Fig. 11. A typical trajectory is – as mentioned
above – quasiperiodic, and in the SOS generates a dense set of points that all
lie on a smooth curve. Several trajectories have been followed in this way and
are represented in Fig. 11 by the diﬀerent individual curves. Each curve ex-
hibits some minimal axial distance ρmin > ρ0; this is a true inequality because
quasiperiodic orbits do not reach their point of closest approach to the z axis
precisely on the focal plane. Since the SOS records the instantaneous ρ upon
crossing the focal plane, the resulting curves have their turning points at larger
ρ.

The only orbits which have their real turning points exactly at the focal plane
are the periodic orbits. A periodic orbit as displayed in Fig. 10 (a) generates
exactly two discrete points in the SOS, corresponding to the two distinct values
of the radial distance ρ at which the axis z = 0 is crossed. Both points in the SOS
lie at pρ = 0 for the periodic orbit, as can be veriﬁed from the trajectory in the
z - ρ plane which always crosses the z axis perpendicularly. The quasiperiodic
trajectory of Fig. 10 (b) corresponds to the leftmost curve in Fig. 11, which has
its turning point almost at ρ0 in the SOS. The caustic is almost on the focal
plane but still oﬀset from it by an amount that is not discernible in Fig. 10 (b).

The distinction between the periodic orbit and its closely neighboring quasiperi-

odic relative in the SOS of Fig. 11 is appreciable – a pair of points generated by
the former, versus a one-dimensional curve for the latter. But exactly on the
line pρ = 0, there exists an inﬁnite number of other pairs of points, belonging
to the periodic orbits of the same family.

34

Figure 11: Poincar´e surface of section of the ray dynamics for Lz = 0.1 f as in
Fig. 10 (a-c). The minimum distance ρ0 from the z axis, given by Eq. (87), is
indicated by the dashed line. All quasiperiodic trajectories ﬁll smooth curves
ρ0 and ρ = 2 f . The two gray dots
extending between some minimum ρmin ≥
are the crossings of the focal plane generated by a periodic orbit as shown in
Fig. 10 (a). The plot uses 2 f as the length unit.

The SOS in these coordinates allows us to see directly in which places the
focal plane comes into contact with the rays under consideration. This is a
central piece of information when it comes to estimating the focussing at this
plane where the quantum well is assumed to be. The forbidden regions around
the z axis induced by the angular momentum barrier show up as inaccessible
portions of the SOS toward small ρ.

6.6 Accuracy of the semiclassical approximation

We can also comment on the striking accuracy of the semiclassical approach
in this system. The Poincar´e section shows that almost all trajectories (with
the exception of the periodic paths) generate curves with the same topology:
they begin and end at ρ = 2 f , with one turning point inbetween. There are
other integrable systems for which the Poincar´e section has a more complicated
structure, one closely related example being the ellipsoidal cavity[22] or its two-
dimensional counterpart, the ellipse billiard[25]. In that case, the phase space
consists of two components in which the topology of the trajectories is diﬀerent:
One type of motion consists of rays circulating around the perimeter as so-
called whispering-gallery orbits, the other is a bouncing-ball oscillation across
the short diameter[20]. There is a division between these two types of trajecto-
ries, similar to that between oscillation and rotation in a pendulum – called the
separatrix. The WKB approximation or its higher-dimensional generalization,
named after Einstein, Brillouin and Keller (EBK), cannot be applied without
severe corrections in the vicinity of such a separatrix in phase space [21, 22, 25].
In our case, this breakdown never occurs, and semiclassical results are thus of
high accuracy. Being a conic section, the parabola can of course be considered
as a limiting case of the ellipse, with one of its foci moved to inﬁnity. This
leaves no possibility for bouncing-ball trajectories, which leads to the absence

35

of a separatrix.

Finally, it is worth asking why the sharp corners at the intersection between
the paraboloid and the focal plane do not cause any corrections to our semi-
classical treatment, even though the surface curvature at these points is clearly
much shorter than the wavelength. It is known that in such cases diﬀraction can
occur which makes it impossible to explain the mode structure purely based on
classical orbits[23, 24]. However, this phenomenon is absent for certain special
angles subtended by the corners. One of these “benign” angles is precisely the
90◦ angle we encounter at the corners of the double paraboloid, cf. Fig. 3. When
the confocal condition is violated so that deviations from a right angle occur at
the corners, we have to expect diﬀractive corrections to the semiclassical anal-
ysis, resulting from classical rays that hit the corners and are reﬂected in an
arbitrary direction because the law of specular reﬂection is undeﬁned in that
instance. Fortunately, we shall see in Section 7 that such orbits are far removed
from the regions of phase space where we expect the important focussing modes
to lie.

In this section, we have discussed how the ray dynamics develops caustic
structure, and how the latter can be represented with the help of the Poincar´e
section. We have also observed that the high-intensity regions in the wave
solutions correspond to the ray caustics, because there the density of rays is
high - in fact divergent if we recall the discussion of the classical turning points
in the eﬀective potential below Eq. (47). Therefore, even in situations where we
cannot obtain the wave solutions easily, their possible intensity distribution can
be inferred by investigating the ray dynamics ﬁrst. This will now be carried out
for a cavity that deviates from the ideal model shape.

7 The non-confocal double paraboloid

Having obtained an overview of the types of ray motion that can be encounterd
in the parabolic dome, and established the connection to the mode structure
of the full vectorial wave equations via the short-wavelength approximation, we
now want to introduce a model cavity for which the wave solutions cannot be
obtained by separation of variables. The variety of possible deviations from the
ideal model geometry of Fig. 3 is enormous, so we have to restrict attention to
certain special distortions that can be expected to be generic in some sense.

7.1 The model deformation

The distortions we choose are obtained by pulling the two intersecting paraboloids
in Fig. 3 apart or pushing them together along the z axis by an amount 2 ǫ.
Speciﬁcally, in spherical coordinates as a function of polar angle θ, the shape is

The respective foci, which coincide in the integrable model, then move oﬀ the
ρ axis. This non-confocal arrangement of the parabolic walls can be viewed as
a model for fabrication-induced deviations from the ideal cavity shape – where
the dome could be slightly too ﬂat or too pointed. It can also be interpreted in
a diﬀerent way, taking into account the possibility that the boundary condition
at the base of the dome is not exactly given by Eq. (7), if some penetration
of the ﬁeld through the dielectric mirror on the quantum well is taken into
account. This is of course a realistic expectation, and its eﬀect on the wave
solutions would be that the TE electric ﬁeld no longer needs to be strictly
symmetric under reﬂection at the focal plane. If one maintains that the dome
has indeed been fabricated with its base in the focal plane, this “soft” boundary
condition on the mirror can be modeled by assuming that our solutions should
correspond to waves reﬂected at a plane removed from the dielectric interface
by some amount ǫ.

Therefore, the non-confocal double paraboloid is a way of taking into account
the cumulative eﬀects of fabrication uncertainty and soft boundary conditions at
the dielectric mirror with a single model parameter ǫ, denoting half the distance
between the foci of the top and bottom parabolic wall in the unfolded cavity.
One could think that a perturbation theory in ǫ could allow us to use the solu-
tions obtained so far and smoothly extend them to the non-confocal situation.
This is the traditional approach in physics and it is the reason why only simple,
integrable systems are treated in textbooks on quantum mechanics or classi-
cal mechanics alike. However, perturbation approaches become tedious and
even impossible for wave equations whose short-wavelength limit (i.e. ray pic-
ture) exhibits chaotic dynamics. The diﬃculties that arise can already be seen
without introducing chaos, if we try to obtain the wave functions of an ellpsoid-
shaped resonator as a perturbative expansion starting from the eigenfunctions
of a spherical cavity. This poses no problems as long as one is interested only
in modes of the ellipsoid whose topology is analogous to that found in the circle
[28]. However, as mentioned earlier, the ellipsoid exhibits separatrix structure
in phase space because there exists a type of motion that the sphere does not
possess: the bouncing-ball trajectories.

Analogous nonperturbative eﬀects arise in the present model, because the
distortion can lead to new types of trajectories that are not present in the con-
focal cavity, in a process known as bifurcation [29, 30]. The ﬁrst consequence of
the deformation ǫ is that the inﬁnite families of periodic orbits break up, leaving
only a distrete number of periodic orbits of the same topology, which can be
divided in an equal number of stable and unstable paths. Stable paths have the
property that rays with slightly diﬀerent initial conditions remain close to the
given periodic path for all times, while unstable periodic orbits are surrounded

37

Figure 12: Surface of section at Lz = 0.1 f of a non-confocal double-paraboloid,
with foci pulled apart by ǫ = 0.02 f . This destabilizes the cavity, leading to
chaotic ray dynamics which generates an irregular cloud of points ﬁlling almost
the whole region that is accessible for this Lz. A special point is encountered
on the line pρ = 0 where the irregularity gives way to a conﬂuence of hyperbolic
traces whose vertices are centered on a single, unstable periodic orbit. The
spatial pattern of this new periodic orbit is shown in Fig. 13 (a).

in their immediate neighborhood by chaos – trajectories deviate from such a
periodic orbit at an exponential rate if the initial condition is only inﬁnitesi-
mally varied. For more quantitative statements and further background on the
transition to chaos, the reader is referred to the literature [29, 31, 17].

7.2 Unstable and stable ray motion in the deformed cavity

The Poincar´e section is very suitable as a diagnostic tool to identify this process
of emerging chaos on on hand, and the stabilization of certain periodic orbits
on the other hand. This is illustrated in Fig. 12. The perturbation consists of
pulling the foci of the walls apart by ǫ = 0.02 f along the z - axis. Since this
preserves the axial symmetry of the cavity, Lz is still a conserved quantity –
the arguments of Section 6.3 rely on no other symmetries of the problem. We
chose Lz = 0.1 f in the plot. The small distortion of one percent is already
suﬃcient to change the phase space portrait signiﬁcantly, compared to Fig.
11). The unstable periodic orbit appearing prominently in Fig. 12) as a so-
called hyperbolic point, is shown in its spatial pattern in Fig. 13 (a). It is a
self-retracing periodic orbit because it reﬂects from the boundary at normal
incidence (in the z - ρ plane).

The eﬀects that chaos can have on the ray motion are illustrated in Fig.
13 (b). Shown there is a single ray trajectory which superﬁcially has some
similarity to Fig. 10 (b). However, the path does not trace out a well-deﬁned
caustic in Fig. 13 (b). What looks like a caustic here is in fact better described
as two caustics of the type in Fig. 10, arranged almost symmetrically with
respect to the focal plane. Note in particular the symmetric occurrence of cusps
both below and above the line z = 0. Recall that in the integrable case the
position ρ0, z0 of the caustic singularity is uniquely given by the turning points

odic orbit arising at ǫ = 0.02 f , Lz = 0.1 f , cf. Fig. 12. For the same parameter,
a chaotic trajectory is seen in (b). Oscillatory motion around stable periodic
orbits occurs in (c) and (d), where ǫ =
0.02 f and Lz = 0.1 f as in the SOS
of Fig. 14. The patterns of type (a) and (c) derive from the periodic motion
of Fig. 10 (a) as a result of the shape perturbation. In real three-dimensional
cartesian space, (e) shows the straight-line ray motion (arrows) giving rise to

ξ0 and η0 (or equivalently u0, v0), in the eﬀective potential. Reversing the sign
of the cusp coordinate z0 corresponds to exchanging the role of ξ and η. The
signiﬁcance of Fig. 13 (b) is therefore that the degrees of freedom ξ and η are
no longer decoupled, because during a single ray trajectory both the cusps at z0
and
z0 are reached. By virtue of Eq. (89), the quantity Z is thus not conserved
anymore. A trajectory is able to exhibit multiple points of closest approach to
the z axis and is not strictly guided by caustics.

−

Under these circumstances, it is not clear what to expect for the mode struc-
ture of the cavity because we lose the possibility of labeling the eigenstates by
a complete set of quantum numbers. This does not imply there are no modes
associated with chaotic rays, but one requires additional techniques to perform
a semiclassical quantization [31, 32]. The destruction of the conserved quantity
Z means that there is one less constraint which the ray trajectories have to sat-
isfy; this allows them to ﬁll two-dimensional areas instead of one-dimensional
curves in the SOS. Since the SOS gives us a picture of how the rays intersect
the plane z = 0, chaotic rays can be seen to show less concentrated overlap with
that plane. We anticipate that the presence of true caustics is required to create
the best focussing action. With this hypothesis, the goal must be to identify
ray orbits that exhibit caustics. This occurs in the vicinity of stable periodic
orbits, due to the fact that perturbed trajectories execute an oscillatory and in
general quasi-periodic motion around such stable orbits. In Fig. 12, however,
no stable periodic orbits can be identiﬁed, telling us that for the deformation
chosen ther, no stable modes with Lz = 0.1 f should exist.

The situation changes if we consider Fig. 14, in which Lz is the same but
the sign of the non-confocal displacement ǫ is reversed. The walls of the dou-
ble paraboloid are hence pushed together instead of being pulled apart. The
resulting phase space structure in the SOS diﬀers markedly from Fig. 12: many
trajectories trace out one-dimensional curves in the SOS which organize as closed
loops, forming island chains that proliferate with various sizes. All these islands

most prominent island of stability is centerd on the the line pρ = 0 where a small
circle indicates the location of the corresponding periodic orbit around which
other trajectories can oscillate. Shown in the inset is the central stable peri-
odic orbit. The next innermost closed line in the SOS belongs to the trajectory

−

are centered around stable periodic orbits – the biggest island of stability lies
symmetrically around the line z = 0 and corresponds to oscillatory motion of
the type shown in Fig. 13 (c). The center of the island is in fact formed by
a periodic orbit similar to Fig. 13 (a) – the only diﬀerence being, that small
perturbations of its initial conditions do not lead to chaos as in Fig. 12, but to
the motion of Fig. 13 (c).

Another oscillatory ray path centered at a stable periodic orbit is shown in
Fig. 13 (d). The pattern should be compared to Fig. 10 (c) which has the same
Lz. The similarity is apparent, except for the fact that the path in Fig. 10 (c)
will eventually ﬁll the remaining gaps in that plot, if one follows it longer. The
path in Fig. 13 (d), on the other hand, is truly restricted to the vicinity of a
self-retracing orbit which reverses its propagation direction at one end due to
perpendicular reﬂection at the wall, and at the other end by running up the
centrifugal barrier perpendicular to the z axis.

All islands of stability in Fig. 14 generate their own caustics, which are topo-
logically diﬀerent from the ones in the integrable system. The caustic created by
the orbit in Fig. 13 (c) is simply the boundary of the regions into which the ray
never penetrates. The diﬀerence between the absence and presence of caustics
in Figs. 13 (b) and (c) is not easily appreciated if we consider only the real-space
plots. Here, the usefulness of the Poincar´e section as a diagnostic tool is again
to be noted – showing two-dimensional clouds of points versus one-dimensional
curves, respectively, for trajectories without and with caustics.

It follows from the preceding discussion that a negative ǫ leaves us with a
cavity that is in many respects similar to the unperturbed double paraboloid, cf.
the ray pattern of Fig. 13 (d). However, the qualitative and important diﬀerence
is that some periodic orbits are now more stabilized than at ǫ = 0. In particular,
there are simple ray bundles such as Fig. 13 (c) that promise reasonable focusing

40

Figure 15: For the same deformation ǫ = 0.02 f as in Fig. 12, this surface of
section at the smaller angular momentum Lz = 0.03 f shows that a stable orbit
exists in addition to the unstable hyperbolic one. This is indicated by the elliptic
(lens-shaped) island structure. The hyperbolic point is located to the right of
the island. The ray pattern near the stable periodic orbit is shown in the inset.
The small corresponding mode volume is apparent.

close to the center of the unfolded cavity. The physical explanation for the
general stabilizing eﬀect that we achieved by moving the paraboloids closer
together lies in the well-known fact that a two-mirror resonator conﬁguration
has a a focusing action when the mirrors are separated less than the sum of
their radii of curvature. Conversely, mirrors that are further apart than this
criterium act in a defocusing way. This is consistent with the observation of a
large chaotic domain in Fig. 12.

These simple arguments, and the chaotic picture of Fig. 12, seem to suggest
that stable ray motion is not to be expected in the supposedly defocusing con-
ﬁguration with ǫ = 0.02 f . However, when applying the standard criteria for
focusing and defocusing resonator geometries, we have to bear in mind that we
are dealing with a centrifugal billiard whose ray trajectories are curved. The
eﬀect of the centrifugal barrier is to push the regions of allowed ray motion out-
wards until only a small patch surrounding the equatorial corners of the cavity
is accessible. At large Lz the motion is then so conﬁned that chaos does not de-
velop. This is just the whispering-gallery phenomenon[17]. On the other hand,
at Lz = 0.1 f we certainly found chaos with no remaining islands of stability.
Small Lz are what we must be interested in if concentration near the focal points
is to be achieved.

In view of this, it is all the more surprising that the same cavity does in fact
support stable orbits at even smaller angular momenta than in Fig. 12. This is
shown in Fig. 15 for Lz = 0.03 f . The periodic orbit responsible for the single
stable island in that SOS is again almost identical to the one shown in Fig. 13
(a), and its oscillatory neighborhood is analogous to Fig. 13 (c); the inset of
Fig. 15 shows this similarity. This stable orbit exists only at suﬃciently small
0.038 f . The

in Fig. 13 (c), and hence the stable modes associated with this pattern should
be robust. This is also conﬁrmed by analogous Poincar´e sections for larger
displacements of the foci. At larger

inset of Fig. 15 is in fact stabilized further – for both directions of displacements
alike.

The modes corresponding to this particular ray pattern are closely related
to the fundamental s-waves we discussed in Section 3.5, because both arise from
ray bundles in the immediate vicinity of the shortest periodic orbits in the cavity.
For ǫ = 0 this was the family of paths in Fig. 10 (a), members of which can be
smoothly deformed into Fig. 13 (a) without changing the topology – i.e., the
number and sequence of reﬂections and turning points. We shall therefore call
all these orbits the fundamental orbits of the cavity. The mode spacing of the
corresponding eigenstates should be comparable as well for the perturbed and
unperturbed case. However, we have to defer a detailed analysis of the wave
solutions and their semiclassical correspondence to a future paper. Here, the
goal has been to introduce the ray dynamics and its phase space as the backbone
on which the mode structure is built.

Assuming that the deformation is ǫ = 0.02 f , we have the peculiar situation
that the fundamental orbit is unstable if Lz > 0.038 f , cf. Fig. 12. Therefore,
the most desirable modes will be those with smaller Lz. According to Eq.
(78), we have to choose modes with low n and high k to achieve this. For the
experimental cavity we have k f
14π. Taking n = 1 as in Section 3.5, we
arrive at the semiclassical value

which is close to the situation depicted in Fig. 15. The diﬀerence in the SOS
is insigniﬁcant. We have no accurate way of determining the actual value of
ǫ most closely describing the real structure, but these considerations give us
considerable conﬁdence that modes with a spatial pattern as in Fig. 13 (c) or
Fig. 15 will be found in the cavity, because the relevant Lz estimated above is
in a range where this fundamental orbit is stable – irrespective of the sign of ǫ
and moreover largely independent of its magnitude.

8 Bragg mirror as an escape window in phase

space

The internal ray dynamics of the dome resonator has up to this point been
evaluated under the assumption that the cavity is a perfect resonator. There
are two physical mechanisms that invalidate this viewpoint: absorption in the
gold mirror and transmission through the Bragg grating. The trade-oﬀ between
the comparatively large absorption of a metal on the one hand and its ability
In our context,
to reﬂect omnidirectionally have been discussed in Ref. [33].

42

metallic absorption will always degrade the Q factor because the gold layer pro-
vides only an estimated 95% reﬂectivity [33]. However, the reﬂectivity of the
Bragg mirror can be signiﬁcantly lower for certain modes and in that case con-
stitutes the dominant mechanism for Q-spoiling. The variable that determines
the reﬂectivity of the Bragg mirror (at the ﬁxed operating frequency) is the an-
gle of incidence χ with respect to the z-axis. For the purposes of a qualitative
analysis, we assume that the Bragg reﬂectivity is unity for χ < 22◦
χc but
20% outside this cone of incidence [33]. In other words, χc is the
drops to
boundary between absorption-dominated and leakage-dominated Q factors. A
second window of high reﬂectivity opens for rays at very oblique incidence on
the grating surface, more speciﬁcally for χ > 60◦. This second window will be
discussed further below.

≈

The ray picture allows us to use this rough transmission criterion as a guide
in order to separate long-lived cavity modes from short-lived ones. The angle χ
between z-axis and a trajectory is, according to Eq. (72), given by

so that

One can substitute this as the righthand side of Eq. (83) and obtains an equation
for a curve in the plane ˙ρ, ρ ( ˙ρ = pρ) spanning the Poincar´e section:

Using the critical value of χc in this equation speciﬁes the escape condition in
the Poincar´e section: the Bragg mirror becomes ineﬀective when

In order to get a feeling for the type of ray orbits that can remain in the
cavity under this escape condition, we plot in Fig. 16 the resulting curves in
the surface of section for the two diﬀerent values of Lz appearing in Figs. 11,
12, 14 and 15. The plot should be superimposed on these plots to decide which
parts of the respective phase space falls within the high-reﬂectivity range of the
DBR grating. Note that the critical lines for ray escape are independent of
deformation because they rely only on Eq. (83).

As a result of this comparison, we ﬁnd ﬁrst of all that low angular momenta
are required by the escape criterion, because the phase-space area enclosed by
the critical curves in Fig. 16 shrinks with increasing Lz. This is understand-
able because the ray motion in this case has a strong azimuthal component

tion to the stable periodic orbits arising in the chaotic Poincar´e sections. The
case Lz = 0.1 f shown previously for illustrative purposes turns out now to be
roughly the maximum angular momentum at which the stable orbit of Fig. 14
is still conﬁned by Bragg reﬂection. The lower angula momentum Lz = 0.03 f
coming close to the estimated value for the s-waves of our experimental cavity, on
the other hand, places the stable periodic orbit well inside the high-reﬂectivity

For the chaotic orbits, we observe that they spread out over the Poincar´e
section in such a way as to yield signiﬁcant overlap with the low-reﬂectivity
regions of Fig. 16. This is true for all Poincar´e sections shown in this paper.
Therefore, we conclude that cavity modes associated with the chaotic phase space
regions are short-lived, and the corresponding broad resonances will not aﬀect
the spontaneous emission enhancement of the parabolic dome. A quantitative
estimate of the resonance lifetimes could be obtained by measuring the time that
a chaotic trajectory spends, on average, in the high-reﬂectivity region without
excursions beyond the critical line. However, we shall not attempt quantitative
predictions at this stage of our investigation, and defer it to future work.

A quantitative analysis would also be necessary to determine the modal life-
times in the marginal case of the ideal confocal cavity. The reason is that the
ray picture alone does not allow a clear distinction between classically conﬁned
and unconﬁned orbits, because the classiﬁcation according to stable and unsta-
ble trajectories does not apply in the integrable parabolic dome. All the solid

in order to remain in the cavity.

curves in the Poincar´e section of Fig. 11 cross into the low-reﬂectivity region
of Fig. 16 at some point, but the time spent in the high-reﬂectivity range can
be very long classically. To illustrate this, we show in Fig. 17 a particular ray
trajectory for Lz = 0.1 f in the confocal paraboliod, which for almost 500 cross-
ings of the focal plane remains inside the regions of high reﬂectivity. This time,
the second window of high reﬂectivity close to the border of the SOS is im-
portant because the ray alternates between the low- and high-χ windows from
one crossing of the focal plane to the next. The regular nature of this motion
makes long lifetimes possible because it strictly prevents the ray from entering
the low-reﬂectivity region for long times, whereas a chaotic orbit would quickly
explore this domain in a quasi-random way.

The trajectory shown in Fig. 17 is practically identical to the one shown in
Fig. 10 (b). The alternating way of intersecting the focal plane can be under-
stood from that ﬁgure, or from Fig. 10 (a) which shows periodic orbits closely
neighboring the quasiperiodic trajectory of plot (b). Note that the ray model al-
lows us in addition to predict the spatial location where the mode corresponding
to this ray bundle will preferentially be coupled out through the Bragg mirror.
As can be seen in Fig. 17, the low-reﬂectivity region is reached for the ﬁrst
time when, after many reﬂections, the trajectory departs from the immediate
neighborhood of the focal region, i.e. intersects the focal plane with a ρ that is
slightly too large.

The subtle balance of parameters that prevents chaos from appearing will, in
all experimental realizations, be shifted to either the defocusing or the focusing
side. Therefore, the above ray analysis of the mixed phase spaces for these
two situations above is our main concern. However, as in the previous sections
the integrable case is a useful starting point to illustrate our strategy. The
advantage of the ray approach is that it provides fast and intuitive predictions,
but further studies are required in order to determine how this model succeeds in
characterizing the cavity quantitatively. Paradoxically, we can already conclude

45

that the existence of chaos and islands of stability makes it easier to obtain
results from a ray analysis, because there is a sharper separation between long
lifetimes for the stable modes discussed above and short lifetimes for modes
associated with the chaotic portions of the SOS.

9 Conclusion

In this paper we have examined the modal structure of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
in a semiconfocal plano-parabolic cavity (or, equivalently, in a double-paraboloid
confocal cavity) in view of our recent fabrication of semiconductor microcavities
having that geometry.
In order to account for the eﬀects of the inevitable
fabrication defects we also considered the stability of the modes with respect to
deformations consisting of deviations with respect confocality. This theoretical
analysis was thus motivated by our ongoing experiments on these structures,
and feeds back into this experimental work by opening a novel perspective in
terms of investigating the chaotic structure and dynamics of some of the modes
of cavity.

Regarding the structure of the modes in the parabolic cavity, we note that
the scalar wave equation is solvable analytically by separation of variables. How-
ever, the vectorial boundary conditions for the electromagnetic ﬁeld destroy this
property, leaving only the cylindrical symmetry. Nevertheless, the fundamental
series of s-waves (free of azimuthal nodes) in a confocal electromagnetic cav-
ity can be solved rigorously. It has its energy concentrated in a small volume
(of order λ3) around the focal point, even though at the focal point itself the
electric ﬁeld is zero due to the vectorial nature of the ﬁeld. The higher order
modes cannot be solved as readily in the full three-dimensional model, but it is
possible to appreciate their features by reducing the problem to scalar form. In
these higher order modes, the energy is concentrated in lobes that surround the
focal point but avoid it because of the centrifugal barrier that arises from the
cylindrical symmetry. Indeed, these modes correspond to non-zero values of the
angular momentum (m
= 0) and for large values of m tend towards a type of
whispering-gallery modes with intensity concentrated in a ring along the focal
plane, [cf. Fig. 10 (d)].

The stability of the modes of the parabolic cavity with respect to geometrical
deformations can be assessed by examining the ray trajectories that correspond
to each mode. For a deformation that corresponds to a small deviation from
confocality, chaotic ray patterns emerge. However, we also ﬁnd stable ray orbits
concentrated in a small part of the cavity volume. Independent of deformation,
the most important stable orbits being those which in cylinder coordinates ρ
and z follow the shortest possible periodic trajectory. This general topology is
the same for a range of deformations (including the ideal confocal cavity) and
corresponds to a ray returning to the same ρ and z after two reﬂections, missing
the focal point by a small amount because the ﬁeld there has to vanish. The

46

6
generic shape of this orbit is represented in Fig.13, and its special modiﬁcation in
the confocal case with its marginal stability is shown in Fig.10. The topological
equivalence between the stable orbits of the distorted cavity on one hand and of
the confocal system on the other indicates that the structure of the fundamental
s-wave is stable with respect to deformations.

From the experimental viewpoint, the results of this theoretical analysis indi-
cate that the cavities already fabricated in our laboratory should possess stable
modes in which the energy is conﬁned in a volume of order λ3 in the vicinity
of the focal point, in spite of fabrication errors. The higher order modes, in
which the ﬁeld is concentrated away from the focal point, in whispering-gallery
type conﬁgurations, will be unstable because of the presence of fabrication de-
fects. At the same time these modes will decay very fast as they correspond to
oblique incidences onto the Bragg mirror, at angles for which the mirror is no
longer reﬂecting. Experiments are in progress to characterize the structure and
dynamics of both the stable and unstable modes [7]. The robust stable modes
in which the ﬁeld is conﬁned in the vicinity of the focal point should give rise
to strong enhancement of the spontaneous emission of a dipole (such as a semi-
conductor quantum well or a semiconductor quantum box) placed there, and
a concomitant lowering of the lasing threshold, even for our cavities that are
of mesoscopic dimensions. This is because because even in such large cavities,
whose geometric volume is of the order of a few thousand cubic wavelengths,
the central lobe of the fundamental s-wave (which contains most of the energy)
has an eﬀective volume of the order of one cubic wavelength.

These considerations underscore the interest that parabolic microresonators
present by exhibiting quantum electrodynamic eﬀects as well as optical chaos,
in spite of their relatively large dimensions. In addition, the mesoscopic cav-
ity dimensions of these structures are an important practical feature, as they
make the fabrication accessible to existing experimental techniques (such as Fo-
cused Ion Beam etching) while, at the same time, they greatly facilitate the
theoretical analysis of these devices as they permit the use of short-wavelength
approximations.

x2 + y2 + z2 is the spherical radius vector. With this deﬁnition, ξ
where r =
and η have the same dimensions as the cartesian coordinates, which is helpful
for physical considerations. The surfaces ξ = constant are paraboloids by revo-
lution about the positive ˆz-axis having their focal point at the origin, while the
surfaces η = constant are directed along the negative ˆz-axis. The plane z = 0
corresponds to the condition ξ = η.

retains u as the variable.

Abstract

This article recounts deﬁnition, classiﬁcation, history, and applications of microstructured
optical ﬁbers.

1. Deﬁnition and Varieties

Since the ﬁrst microstructured optical ﬁber (MOF) demonstrated by Knight et al.,1 research
on this class of optical waveguides has thrived. To date, lots of ﬁbers with air-hole inclusions
were reported. In fact, to meet diﬀerent application purposes, the “holey” ﬁbers experience
constant alterations and they evolve divergently in many directions. Some of ﬁbers deviate
much in structure from that in the very ﬁrst publication. To address these ﬁbers, several
names have been coined—they include photonic crystal ﬁber (PCF), holey ﬁber (HF), mi-
crostructured optical ﬁber (MOF), and photonic bandgap ﬁber (PBGF). “PCF”, “HF”, and
“MOF” are deﬁned from structure point of view, whereas “PBGF” are deﬁned from optical-
property point of view. Among the names, MOF is the most general one. In fact, MOF can
be used to address all ﬁbers which have their feature size at micrometer (or submicrometer)
scale. The rest names can be considered as subsets of MOF, and they can’t address rigorously
all MOFs reported in general. For example, “PCF” is not appropriate for ﬁbers which lack
of periodic cladding; “HF” is not appropriate for those ﬁbers made of all solid materials;
“PBGF” is certainly only applicable for those guiding light by cladding’s photonic bandgap
(PBG).

Figure 1 and 2 show novel MOFs made or proposed during recent years. While PBG
ﬁbers (except the air-silica Bragg ﬁber) shown in Fig. 2 are observed to adhere to the term
“photonic crystal (PC)” faithfully, index-guiding ﬁbers sometimes can be nothing to do with
photonic crystal (for example, the air-clad ﬁber). We will come across most of the ﬁbers
displayed in these two ﬁgures later in Section 3 of this chapter.

Index-guiding MOFs not presented in Fig. 1 include hole-assisted MOFs,13, 14 double-clad
index-guiding MOF,3 and graded-index MOF.15 PBG-guiding MOFs not presented in Fig. 2

not shown in either of the ﬁgures.

Having mentioned all these MOF varieties, we will however limit discussions on MOFs
with periodic cladding in this thesis. Hence in certain places an MOF can be also referred
to as PCF without ambiguity.

A.

Index-guiding v.s. PBG-guiding

In fact, the index-guiding ﬁber can be considered as a PBG-guiding ﬁber in the sense that the
propagation constant of a core mode can not be supported by the cladding. The bandgap
region used in an index-guiding ﬁber is the largest one possessed by the cladding, i.e.,
the region below the cladding’s radiation line β = knclad in β − k plot (β is the x-axis
value, β = 2π
λ , with λ free-space wavelength). In this region, the cladding
can’t support any propagating mode, as the lightwave (wavelength at λ) in a homogeneous
material (refractive index at n) should have its smallest propagation constant at β = 2π
λ n.
And the smallest propagation constant happens when the light propagates as a plane wave.
Any other mode of propagation will increase its propagation constant.

λ neﬀ and k = 2π

Refer to Fig. 3, as an inﬁnitely-extending rod of high-index (ncore) is introduced in an
inﬁnitely-extending low-index material (nclad), due to the fact that the high-index material
has its radiation line β = kncore positioned lower than that for the low-index material
β = knclad, there exists a region in the β − k plot (enclosed by β = kncore and β = knclad)
in which light can propagating in the rod but not in the background material. This is how
a conventional step-index ﬁber works.

Now as the homogeneous background material is replaced by a photonic crystal, the
cladding’s radiation line becomes β = knfsm, where nfsm is eﬀective index of the funda-
mental space-ﬁlling mode (FSM) of the crystal structure. The main diﬀerence between a
composite and a homogeneous material is that, other than the region below its radiation
line, there are, possibly, some small regions above the radiation line, in which light can’t
propagate in the crystal [Fig. 3(b)]. Indeed, we can make use of these small regions to con-
ﬁne light in a material whose index is smaller than nfsm. This is how a photonic bandgap
ﬁber works.

B. PBG-guiding v.s. Guidance by Antiresonant-reﬂection

To diﬀerentiate these two terms, we have to recall the history of the antiresonant-reﬂecting
optical waveguide (ARROW).

Multi-layered substrate was proposed by Ash to replace homogeneous substrate in slab
waveguide to guide surface wave in 197019 1. Such problem was then theoretically treated

core but not allowed in cladding) are possible. ncore, nclad, nfsm are assumed to be constant
with respect to wavelength.

by A. J. Fox in 1974.20 Both papers call such waveguide as grating waveguide. However,
Fox did not show wave guidance in a low-index material. Two years later, Yeh et al. the-
oretically demonstrated, by use of Floquet-Bloch theorem, guidance in low-index material
(air) for a slab waveguide with layered cladding.21 Such waveguide is named by Yeh et al. as
Bragg waveguide. In this paper, very importantly, they used a third material in core region
(air), and cladding is a periodic structure made of two solid materials. Half a year later,
Cho from Bell Laboratories experimentally conﬁrmed conﬁned propagation in such waveg-
uides.22 In 1978, Yeh et al. put one step further from slab-type waveguides, and proposed
to use multi-layered cylinders to propagate light in an air column.23 Such ﬁber is named
as Bragg ﬁber. Both slab-type Bragg waveguide and the Bragg ﬁber were not investigated
further until eight years later in 1986 Duguay et al. fabricated on silicon wafer a Bragg
waveguide.24 Their waveguide is however formed by two material, i.e., core material is one of
the cladding materials. But Duguay et al. rename the waveguide as “antiresonant-reﬂecting
optical waveguide” (ARROW) and attribute the guidance to the antiresonance of the high-
index layer (analogous to a Fabry-Perot resonator) placed adjacent to the low-index core. To
some extent, this paper revives the research on such waveguides. A 2D ridge-type ARROW
was also fabricated by Freye et al. in 1994.25

Research on ARROW should really be considered as pioneer work on photonic crystal
waveguides (bandgap guidance). In fact, these work can easily lead to the concept of photonic
crystal. However, as the authors did not generalize the layered dielectric media to other
dimensions, their impact was limited.

Let’s review what is the traditional ARROW model made popular by Duguay et al.. Refer
to the simplest slab-type ARROW shown in Fig. 4, the model states that properties of the
high-index layers around the core determines the guidance in the low-index core region. When
the high-index cladding layers are in resonance with the core mode, light is relayed outwards
laterally by the high-index layers. When the layers are not in resonance (in antiresonance)
with the core mode, light is rejected and conﬁnement in low-index core region is achieved. The
resonant and antiresonant conditions can be quantitatively derived from the Bragg reﬂection
conditions for the lateral wavevector component kx (Fig. 4). The lateral phase variation in
a high-index layer is

φx = k0qn2

· d2.

(1)

where d2 is width of high-index layers. If φx is equal to odd number of π/2, the high-index
layers are considered to be in antiresonant state with the core mode. Or we can say Bragg
reﬂection is met along x-direction. The core mode hence has the least radiation loss under
this condition. If φx is equal to even number of π/2, the high-index layers are considered to
be in resonant state with the core mode. The core mode experiences rapid dissipation after
being launched.

Fig. 4. A traditional ARROW waveguide. Refractive index n2 > n1. The big arrow denotes
light is launched into the core region. Notice the core can be made of a third material of
diﬀerent index (normally lower than both n1 and n2).21 kz is the wavevector component
in longitudinal direction, which can be more commonly written as β. kx is the wavevector
component in lateral direction. Notice for a particular propagation mode, kx has diﬀerent
values in layers with diﬀerent refractive indices, whereas the same kz value is shared in all
layers.

This traditional ARROW model does explain successfully light conﬁnement in a material
of lower index. It even does not acknowledge the cladding to be periodic (which suggests
that we might have missed certain things as nowadays we explicitly use a periodic PC
cladding to conﬁne light in a lower index material). Also the model can accurately predict
the exact highest-loss and lowest-loss wavelength points by considering the high-index layers
in cladding to be in complete resonance and antiresonance, respectively. However, we would
like to point out that ARROW is indeed just another name for regular waveguides whose
guidance is achieved by the photonic bandgap eﬀect. Antiresonance of cladding composite
gives rise to a forbidden bandgap. And in fact, we should establish a equation

cladding bandgap = completely antiresonant state of cladding

+ partially antiresonant states of cladding.

(2)

In the ARROW model proposed by Duguay et al., the role of low-index layers in cladding
region has been ignored. In fact, their antiresonance also contributes to the conﬁnement of
lightwave in core region2. In other words, to better conﬁne light in the core region, we need
2However, the antiresonance of the low-index layers has less contribution than that of the high-index layers
to the conﬁnement of lightwave. This can be easily explained by calculating a few lowest-order supermodes (or
space-ﬁlling modes) of the cladding composite. The ﬁrst group of modes have about π lateral phase variation
in the high-index layers. The next group of modes have about π/2 lateral phase variation in the high-index
layers. For both mode groups, very little ﬁeld is located in the low-index layers. If we plot the dispersion

to tune the widths of both high- and low-index layers in cladding so that they meet their
anti-resonance conditions together.

ARROW model is straightforward for slab-type waveguides shown in Fig. 4. Nice equa-
tions can be written down to determine wavelength points where the lowest and the highest
leakage loss happen. However, it should be mentioned that such equations are diﬃcult, if
not impossible, to be analytically written down for a 2D PBG waveguide. For example, for
the all-solid PBG ﬁber shown in Fig. 2(f), though the resonance conditions for the cladding
high-index rods can be approximately written down using certain expression,26, 27 resonance
condition for the low-index cladding region is not. Especially in such 2D waveguides a full
transverse bandgap of the cladding is necessary for conﬁning light. Hence we have to consider
all wavevector components in the transverse direction for analyzing resonance and antireso-
nance conditions (remember we only considered x-component of the wavevector for slab-type
waveguide shown in Fig. 4).

At this point, we may conclude that the name “photonic crystal ﬁber” is sometimes mis-
leading, as it gives us the impression that photonic bandgaps can only exist in periodic
cladding structures. A consequence of the ARROW model is that the cladding of an PBG
waveguide does not need to be periodic. Refer to Fig. 4, the most straightforward example
would be: the high-index cladding layers can be of certain width to cause π/2 lateral phase
variation, and they also can be thicker to introduce 3π/2 lateral phase variation. Besides,
as far as the optimum conﬁnement at a particular wavelength is concerned, the periodicity
requirement of the cladding composite is automatically lifted in the case of Bragg ﬁber (and
any other 2D PBG waveguide). This is owing to the fact that mode ﬁeld in a Bragg ﬁber is
represented by aperiodic Bessel functions3.23

curves for these two groups of modes in a β-k diagram, the region in between of these two dispersion curve
groups is the bandgap used for our guidance. As little ﬁeld is located in low-index layers, this consequence
is valid:

some small variation in the low-index layer width
→ little change in two mode groups’ dispersion curves
→ little change in the bandgap
→ little change in guidance in core region.

In above argument, we have assumed the primary bandgap of the cladding is used for guidance. This makes
sense, as ARROWs and PBGFs fabricated to date almost explicitly use bandgaps found among several
lowest-order space-ﬁlling modes.

3For a 2D PBG ﬁber like Bragg ﬁber, we would however be better oﬀ by using a periodic cladding in
practice. There are several reasons. First, aperiodic cladding can only enhance guidance at a single wavelength
point, not the whole cladding PBG window. And improvement in PBG guidance can always be achieved
by including more cladding layers. Second, fabrication of periodic structure is easier than that of aperiodic
structure. Third, periodic structure facilitates deployment of Bloch theorem in bandgap calculation.

2. PCF Classiﬁcation

Figure 5 shows the possible conﬁgurations of a PCF. This ﬁgure has generalized PCF to
those made of a PC cladding and a PC core.18 Though we only consider PCs made of two
materials, it should be kept in mind that more materials can be involved. Structurally, only
PCs exhibiting C6v symmetry are presented owing to their ease of fabrication. Depending
on fabrication method, other-latticed PCs should be able to exist.

From Fig. 5, a particular two-material ﬁber can be named accurately by mentioning the
cladding and core structures. For example, if the cladding is TPC and core is HPC, then the
ﬁber can be referred to as a TPC-HPC ﬁber; for a ﬁber with TPC cladding and silica core,
we can name it as solid-core TPC ﬁber; for a ﬁber with TPC cladding and air core, we can
name it as air-core TPC ﬁber, etc.

Besides those shown in Fig. 5, we should mention that a MOF can have a homogeneous

cladding and a PC core.28

1. Triangular v.s. Honeycomb

These two terms are sometimes confusing. Early PCFs are made of circular air holes in silica
background. Hence, we normally tell a PCF’s cladding type according to the placement of
air holes. However, as PCF design gets complicated, such as air-guiding TPC ﬁber and HPC
ﬁber shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the ﬁber cladding is more close to silica rods immersed in air
background.8, 29 If we deﬁne the lattice according to position of the silica pillars, traditional
TPC (HPC) becomes HPC (TPC).

9

Addressing the lattice pattern of a PC can also be ambiguous without specifying corre-
sponding lattice vectors. For a traditional HPC, if we use a second-level unit-cell, the crystal
becomes a TPC.18

In this thesis, we stick to traditional naming convention, i.e., a crystal structure is deﬁned
by the air hole positions, though the air holes may not be circular. Also, the primitive basis
vectors are normally used for deﬁning the crystal’s lattice pattern, unless otherwise stated.

3. Technology Review and Current Trends

A.

Index-guiding MOF

1. Technology Review

The possibility of fabricating a ﬁber whose cladding is made of photonic crystal was ﬁrst
proposed in30 4. In this paper, Birks et al. theoretically showed that full 2D photonic bandgaps
exist in an air-silica (holes-in-silica) photonic crystal (PC) when the oﬀ-plane wavevector
component is large enough. And they suggest “a new type of optical ﬁbre, the PBG ﬁbre,
is possible” by using “a periodic air/silica cladding surrounding a uniform core”. “The core
can be solid silica or a hollow air region”. One year later, the same group published a
paper on the ﬁrst fabricated photonic crystal ﬁber (PCF).1 As the central defect is silica,
the ﬁber does not guide light using PBG eﬀect. Though Knight et al. have included the
term “photonic crystal” in naming the waveguide, the ﬁber, in principle, is equivalent to
a conventional step-index ﬁber (SIF). Lack of PBG guidance, however, does not prevent
such ﬁber being exceptional. Knight et al. identiﬁes an interesting property, i.e., it has is a
very broad single-mode operation wavelength range (458nm∼1550nm for the ﬁber reported,
with Λ = 2.3µm and d/Λ = 0.15). Their work attracted immediately lots of attention and
related studies were carried out by diﬀerent research groups around the world. More special
waveguiding properties were reported. In year 1998, Mogilevtsev et al. theoretically studied
group velocity dispersion (GVD) of PCFs,34 and found some novel dispersion properties, such
as zero-dispersion point at short wavelength and large normal dispersion value at 1550nm,
can be easily achieved by adjusting the ﬁber parameters (Λ and d). The dispersion tuning in
such ﬁbers was later overwhelmingly studied by researchers. To name a few, dispersion-ﬂatten
PCFs were studied in,35–39 dispersion-compensating PCFs were studied in.40–43 Remarkable
birefringence property of PCFs were also reported on several occasions in the literature. They
4Here we would like to draw attention to the paper published in 1978 by Yeh et al. on Bragg ﬁber.23
Strictly speaking, their work should be regarded as the ﬁrst paper on ﬁber design employing a photonic
crystal (1D) cladding. However, they did’t generalize the idea to 2D and 3D situations. Their work was put
into practice by a group of people in MIT about 20 years later (for example, see31 and16). This is quite
similar to the case that 1D photonic crystal was ﬁrst explained by Lord Rayleigh in 1887, but revived by E.
Yablonovitch32 and S. John33 100 years later. There are always some people ahead of time.

include.4, 44–46 Nonlinear optics in PCFs is also demonstrated to be promising as the ﬁbers
can be fabricated with ultrahigh nonlinearity can be fabricated using large-sized cladding air
holes and small silica core. Among all nonlinear eﬀects, third-harmonic generation in PCF
can be found in,47 four-wave mixing can be found in, for example,,48, 49 Raman eﬀect can be
found in,50–52 supercontinuum phenomenon can be found in, for example,53–55 etc, etc.

It should be mentioned that beside using silica, other materials are also explored for,
especially, index-guiding PCF design. The materials include high-lead silicate glass, tellurite
glass, gallium lanthanum chalcosulﬁde glass, and also polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA).
The ﬁrst three types of glasses have quite low softening temperature, hence they are also
called soft glasses. Using these soft glasses to fabricate PCFs has been summarized in.56 Two
thermally-matched soft glasses have also been used to form an index-guiding PCF.6 The ﬁrst
polymer PCF was reported in.57

2. Trends

Though conﬁnement loss of index-guiding MOF has been reduced to 0.48 dB/km,58 we don’t
see immediate necessity to deploy such ﬁber into transmission system. There are several rea-
sons for this: ﬁrst of all, the loss is still higher than conventional step-index ﬁber; second,
the cost is certainly higher as compared to standard commercial step-index ﬁber5; third,
compatibility (such as splicing) with existing system is still a problem. Index-guiding MOF
can indeed be tailored to have some excellent property in certain aspect, but not all aspects.
In next few years, application of such ﬁbers would, most probably, still be limited to subsys-
tems or optical devices. In particular, exploration of high nonlinearity and high birefringence
properties in MOFs would be likely to attract fair amount of attention. Its deployment in
ﬁber lasers will also be a very meaningful research topic.

B. PBG-guiding MOF

1. Technology Review

The ﬁrst PCF whose guidance is due to existence of its cladding PC’s photonic bandgap
(PBG) was reported in year 1998 by Knight et al.59 However, the propagating light concen-
trates in silica portion within the core region, which is inevitable as the ﬁber’s cladding is of
honeycomb lattice and the core is made of air-silica composite.18 The ﬁrst air-guiding PBG
ﬁber was reported in 1999 by Cregan et al.60 The transmission spectrum is measured using a
short ﬁber of a few centimeter length. It is claimed to be single-mode. However, the authors
5MOF uses only pure silica, therefore its preform is cheaper in terms of material as compared to conven-
tional SIFs where doping of chemical element is involved. But stacking of preform bundle is labor-intensive
(there is currently no better way to prepare the preform) and the uncertainties involved during fabrication
(dust contamination, ﬂuctuation in pressure controlling etc) is higher than that for conventional ﬁber. Unless
high-level automation is realized, it is correct to conclude that MOFs are more expensive.

11

didn’t convincingly prove their point. Fiber technique is greatly improved in the following
several years. By year 2003, loss is greatly reduced to 13dB/km at 1500nm by Corning.7 And
in year 2004, lowest ﬁber loss is even as small as 1.2 dB/km.61, 62

Air-guiding PBG ﬁber was originally proposed for ultra-low loss optical communication.
In addition, it was said that signal propagating in such ﬁber is “free of group velocity
dispersion”. However, to date, we have achieved neither of these two goals. The loss is
still high compared to conventional step-index ﬁbers. The group velocity dispersion is quite
large, especially near bandgap edges.63 Recently it is found that there are uncertainties in
such ﬁber’s polarization mode dispersion (PMD) property.64 What’s more, a true low-loss
single-mode air-guiding PBG ﬁber has never been fabricated. All these factors would prevent
such ﬁber from being deployed for long-haul transmission link at this moment. However, due
to the unique hollow-core feature, it has thrived in areas like high-power pulse delivery,65, 66
nonlinear optics in gases,67, 68 atom guiding,69 and sensing applications,70 etc.

Besides hollow-core PBG ﬁbers, there exist several types of solid-core PBG ﬁbers. Theo-
retical work on this can be traced to71 and.27 Experimentally, two soft glasses have been used
to fabricate a PBG ﬁber by Luan et al.12 Doped silica has also been used to form scatterers in
the cladding region of a solid-core PBG ﬁber.72 It was observed that such low-index contrast
PBG ﬁber has wider transmission window.72 However, no particular application has so far
been identiﬁed using these types of ﬁbers, largely due to the fact that light is conﬁned in a
solid core, which is quite analogues to conventional step-index ﬁber.

Besides using 2D PC to form a PBG ﬁber’s cladding, cylindrical-1D PC was also exploited
for conﬁning light in a hollow core. Omniguide ﬁber, or Bragg ﬁber, was ﬁrst fabricated by
Fink et al .31 The same group has demonstrated using Bragg ﬁber to deliver high-power CO2
laser.16 Recently, they have produced such ﬁber with transmission window near IR (0.85
to 2.28µm) wavelength.73 Vienne et al. fabricated the so-called air-silica Bragg ﬁber whose
cladding highly resembles a cylindrical-1D PC.11 Very similar Bragg ﬁber has also been
fabricated very recently by Agyros et al. using air and polymer.74 However, the air-silica
Bragg ﬁber suﬀers from a very fragmented transmission window.75 Whereas Bragg ﬁbers
made by Fink’s group has three materials (core is made of air, cladding is made of soft
glass and polymer bi-layers), people have also tried to fabricate Bragg ﬁbers using two solid
materials (core material is one of the cladding materials with lower index). These include.17, 76

2. Trends

The traditional air-guiding PBG ﬁber uses a TPC cladding. Such 2D PC was recently gener-
alized by Yan et al .29 It is found that by slightly modifying the PC structure, it is possible to
tune the bandgap favorably for diﬀerent purposes, e.g., smaller leakage or even true single-
mode air-guiding etc. A hollow-core ﬁber with such PC cladding was theoretically studied

12

in.77 The ﬁber has very wide surface-mode-free PBG guiding wavelength range and it pro-
motes single-mode operation. Technologically speaking, fabrication of such ﬁber does not
impose any additional diﬃculty as compared to conventional air-guiding PBG ﬁber. It will
be very interesting to see an actual ﬁber in near future.

HPC cladding was not considered to achieve air guiding until its capability was theoreti-
cally validated by Yan et al.78 Such ﬁber’s leakage loss was later studied in.8 The hollow-core
of such ﬁber can be less than 6µm in diameter, which suggests single-mode operation is
possible. Also the surface-mode problem has been completely mitigated in such ﬁbers. Such
HPCF can be a competitive alternative to existing air-guiding PBG ﬁbers if they can be
fabricated successfully.

As we have mentioned, the ﬁrst fabricated honeycomb PBG ﬁber has an air-silica compos-
ite core.59 The idea of using two diﬀerent pieces of PCs to form a ﬁber (core and cladding
are both composite) was put forward by Yan et al.18 Depends on the design, PBG-guiding
or index-guiding can be achieved in such ﬁbers. Such ﬁbers are expected to perform better
in application of gas or liquid sensor. Also, they should have important applications that
exploit the phenomenon of discrete soliton.79

As compared to air-silica PBGFs, Bragg ﬁber suﬀers signiﬁcantly higher radiation loss.
New types of high index-contrast, low-absorption dielectric materials which are matched in
thermal properties (softening temperatures, expansion coeﬃcients, viscosity) and chemical
properties (non-diﬀusive to each other) need to be identiﬁed to fabricate more robust hollow-
core Bragg ﬁber. Preferably, the guidance should be around 1550nm wavelength point. For
air-silica Bragg ﬁber fabricated by Vienne et al., more theoretically work is necessary to
understand its leakage loss. It might be possible to prevent the fragmentation of the trans-
mission window by an improved design. If that indeed happens, we can reduce the overall
leakage loss by increasing the number of air-hole rings in the cladding.

Application-wise, high-power pulse or beam delivery will still be an important direction to
go.80 Nonlinear optics in such ﬁbers with gas- or liquid-ﬁlled core will also be very interesting.

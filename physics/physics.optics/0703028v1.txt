We report the experimental demonstration of directly produced polarization squeezing at 1064
nm from a type I optical parametric ampliﬁer (OPA) based on a periodically poled KTP crystal
(PPKTP). The orthogonal polarization modes of the polarization squeezed state are both deﬁned
by the OPA cavity mode, and the birefringence induced by the PPKTP crystal is compensated for
by a second, but inactive, PPKTP crystal. Stokes parameter squeezing of 3.6 dB and anti squeezing
of 9.4 dB is observed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The quantum properties of polarization states of light
has recently received a great deal of attention. It is not
only interesting from a fundamental point of view, but it
also has some practical relevance since it facilitates the
execution of various quantum information protocols: A
future quantum information network will probably con-
sist of nodes of atoms, where the quantum information
are processed, linked by optical channels [1]. The trans-
fer of quantum information from atoms to photons and
photons to atoms is made possible using the quantum
properties of the diﬀerent polarization states [2].

Several methods for generating polarization squeezed
states have been proposed and experimentally realized.
For example, making use of the nonlinearity provided by
Kerr-like media, such as in nonlinear ﬁbers and atomic
media, or by combining a dim quadrature squeezed beam
generated by an optical parametric ampliﬁer (OPA) with
a bright coherent beam on a polarizing beam splitter
(PBS) [2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

In the works by Heersink et al. [12, 13], polarisation
squeezed light was generated by combining two orthogo-
nally polarisation components inside a spatial mode sup-
ported by a ﬁber. It means that the polarisation squeezed
state was directly generated in the nonlinear medium. In
contrast, in previous approaches where optical paramet-
ric ampliﬁcation has been used, the polarisation squeez-
ing was produced by combining a coherent beam with a
quadrature squeezed beam on a polarizing beam splitter.
This method is limited by the losses of the beam splitter
and imperfect spatial mode overlap in the beam splitter.
In this paper we overcome this problem by injecting the
coherent beam into the cavity along with the squeezed
beam but in an orthognal polarization mode. Since both
beams are supported by the same spatial cavity mode
the spatial overlap between them is perfect, and thus the
polarisation squeezing is optimized. Also in this paper

we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time squeezing at 1064 nm
using periodically poled KTP. This crystal has proven to
be superior for squeezed state generation due to the ab-
sence of nonlinear absorption eﬀects. It has been use to
squeeze light at 532 nm [18], 795 nm [19, 20], 860 nm [21]
and 946 nm [22] but so far not at 1064 nm.

II. POLARIZATION SQUEEZING

The polarization state of light can be described by the
four Stokes operators ˆS0, ˆS1, ˆS2 and ˆS3, where ˆS0 rep-
resents the beam intensity whereas ˆS1, ˆS2 and ˆS3 char-
acterize its polarization and form a cartesian coordinate
system . If the Stokes vector points in the direction of ˆS1,
ˆS2 or ˆS3 the polarized part of the beam is horizontally,
linearly at 45◦, or right-circularly polarized, respectively
[3, 4]. It is well known that the polarization of a light
beam is a property which is limited by quantum noise and
that it is possible to achieve polarization states below the
standard quantum noise limit (QNL). This was ﬁrst sug-
gested in the work by Cirkin et al.
in 1993 [5], where
the Heisenberg inequalities for the Stokes operators were
derived by making use of their cyclical commutation re-
lations:

V ˆSi

V ˆSj

≥ εijk|h ˆS2

ki|,

(1)

where i, j, k = 1, 2, 3. This means that intrinsic quantum
ﬂuctuations of the diﬀerent Stokes operators exist. The
i i − h ˆSii2, can
variances of the Stokes operators, Vi = h ˆS2
be expressed in terms of the amplitude and phase quadra-
ture operator variances, V ±
s,p, where ± refers to squeez-
ing and anti-squeezing of the s- and p-polarized states,
respectively. Assuming that the s- and p-polarized states
are uncorrelated it can be shown that the variance of the
diﬀerent Stokes operators are given by [6]:
sV +
V0 = V1 = α2
V2(θ) = cos2(θ)(cid:0)α2

s + α2
sV +
+ sin2(θ)(cid:0)α2
V3(θ) = V2(θ − π/2),

pV +
p + α2
sV −

pV +
s (cid:1)
pV −
p + α2
s (cid:1)

(2)

p

where θ is the phase between the s-polarized and p-
polarized beams and αs, αp are the classical amplitudes.
In our experiment we use a phase diﬀerence of θ = 0.

In the case of an s-polarized bright amplitude squeezed
beam and vacuum in the orthogonal polarization mode
we expect the variances to be: V0 = V1 < 1 and
V2 = V3 = 1, where we have normalized the QNL and
amplitudes. Note that this is not polarization squeez-
ing, but simply amplitude squeezing. The generation of
polarization squeezing requires the presence of vacuum
squeezing along with a bright beam. For example, con-
sidering the case of a dim s-polarized squeezed beam and
a strong p-polarized coherent beam the expected vari-
ances will be: V0 = V1 = 1, V2 < 1 and V3 > 1 (see
Eq. 2), and thus the state is polarization squeezed.

The polarization states can also be visualized in a 3-
dimensional diagram, the so-called Poincar´e sphere. The
mapping of the state onto the Poincar´e sphere provides
the full characterization. A recent example of such a
mapping of the polarization state was demonstrated by
Marquardt et al.
[7]. The polarization plane on which
the classical stokes parameter is perpendicular deﬁnes the
polarisation squeezing of the state in case of large coher-
ent excitation [13]. Therefore, if the light is classically S1
polarized, the ”dark” polarization plane is spanned by
the S2 and S3 parameters, and the squeezing and anti-
squeezing of the quantum polarization is to be found in
this plane. Using this simple observation, the analogy be-
tween polarization squeezing and quadrature squeezing is
obvious [8, 9].

III. GENERATION AND DETECTION OF
POLARIZATION SQUEEZING

Our squeezing setup is depicted in Fig. 1 and consists
of an empty cavity, an optical parametric ampliﬁer and
a detection scheme. The laser source, a cw solid-state
monolithic YAG laser, Diabolo from Innolight, provides
800 mW at 532 nm and 450 mW power at 1064 nm.
The 1064 nm beam from the laser is directed through an
empty ring cavity, a so-called mode-cleaner (MC), which
ﬁlters out the intensity and frequency noise of the laser
above the bandwidth of the MC. In addition the MC
deﬁnes a high quality spatial TEM00 mode. A bandwidth
of 2.7 MHz is measured and a transmission greater than
90% is obtained for the TEM00 mode.

We used a bow-tie shaped cavity for the OPA in or-
der to avoid possible destructive interference that may
result from a double passed linear cavity. Furthermore
the circulating beam encounters the passive loss in the
crystal only once per round trip. The nonlinear crys-
tal used is a 1x2x10 mm3 type I periodically poled KTP
(PPKTP) crystal manufactured by Raicol Inc. Our bow-
tie cavity consists of two curved mirrors of 25 mm radius
of curvature and two plane mirrors. Three of the mir-
rors are highly reﬂective at 1064 nm, R > 99.9%, while
the output coupler has a transmission of T = 15%. The

pensating crystal.

transmittance of the mirrors at the pump wavelength,
532 nm, is more than 95%. The crystal is placed in the
smallest beam waist, which is located between the two
curved mirrors. In order to maximize the conversion ef-
ﬁciency, corresponding to an optimization of the Boyd-
Kleinmann factor [23], a beam waist of 20 µm is chosen.
This was enabled by using a cavity length of about 145
mm and setting the distance between the two curved mir-
rors to be 28 mm. The OPA has a measured ﬁnesse of
approximately 20, a free spectral range (FSR) of 2 GHz
and a cavity bandwidth of 100 MHz. From the ﬁnesse
of the cavity we deduced an overall intra-cavity loss of
L = 1.0 ± 0.2%.

We use the half-wave plate in front of the OPA to
inject a beam that has components of both s- and p-
polarization, where the s-polarized beam is a seed for the
squeezed beam, and the p-polarized beam is the coherent
beam. Due to the birefringence of the nonlinear crys-
tal the s- and p-polarization is not simultaneously reso-
nant. A diﬀerence between the s- and p-polarization res-
onances is measured to 0.5 FSR at a crystal temperature
of 32◦C, which is the optimal phase-matching tempera-
ture. By changing the temperature of the crystal to 24◦C
a simultaneous resonance of the s- and p-polarization
could be enabled. However, this temperature lies outside
the phase-matching bandwidth of the nonlinear crystal,
which was measured to be approximately 5◦C. We there-
fore use a second, but identical, PPKTP crystal for com-
pensating the birefringence. We tune the temperature of
the second crystal so that the s- and p-polarization are
simultaneously resonant. The cavity was locked to reso-
nance using the Pound Drever Hall locking technique [24].
Depending on the relative phase between the pump
and the seed, the seed is either ampliﬁed or de-ampliﬁed.
We measure a maximum ampliﬁcation of 14 and a de-
ampliﬁcation of 0.38. The relative phase is locked to de-
ampliﬁcation in order to generate an amplitude quadra-

ture squeezed beam. This beam is then directed to the
polarization measurement scheme [25].

In order to perform the measurement of the Stokes op-
erators the state propagates through a sequence of wave-
plates and is subsequently projected on a PBS. The in-
tensities of the two outputs are then measured and by
subtracting the resulting photocurrents any Stokes pa-
rameter can be accessed. If the waveplates are aligned so
that the polarization state is unchanged ˆS1 is accessed.
To measure ˆS2 the polarization of the beam was rotated
by 45◦ with a half-wave plate, and if, in addition to the
half wave plate rotation, a quarter wave plate introduces
a π/2 phase shift between s- and p-polarization, ˆS3 is
measured. The spectral densities of the resulting diﬀer-
ence currents are measured with an electronic spectrum
analyser (ESA).

The measurements were performed at a detection fre-
quency of 14 MHz. The detectors used are designed to
be resonant at 14 MHz having a 1 MHz bandwidth. The
variances have all been corrected for dark-noise of the de-
tectors, which is more than 12 ± 0.2 dB below the QNL,
and thus had a negligible eﬀect on the noise spectrum.
Each trace depicted in Fig. 2 is normalised to the QNL
and measured with a resolution bandwidth (RBW) of the
ESA set to 300 kHz and with a video bandwidth (VBW)
of 300 Hz. The calibration of the QNL is done by op-
erating the OPA without the pump. We then adjusted
the seed power to be equal to that of the squeezed beam
when the pump is turned on.

The total detection eﬃciency of our experiment is given
by: ηtotal = ηcavηpropηdetηOL, where ηprop = 0.97 ± 0.02
is the propagation eﬃciency from the cavity to the detec-
tors, ηdet = 0.95 ± 0.02 is the quantum eﬃciency of the
photo-detectors, ηcav = T /(T + L) = 0.94 is the quan-
tum escape eﬃciency and ηOL is the overlap eﬃciency.
Since both the seed and coherent beam are injected into
the cavity the eﬃciency is ηOL ≈ 1. The total detection
eﬃciency of our system is therefore ηtotal = 0.87 ± 0.02.
We ﬁrst measured the polarization state of a sin-
gle bright amplitude squeezed beam without a coher-
ent beam in the orthogonal polarization mode. This
is achieved by injecting all the OPA seed light into
the squeezed p-polarization mode and subsequently mea-
suring the amplitude of output with a single detector.
The variance of the measurement outcomes is displayed
in Fig. 2a, and we see that amplitude squeezing of -
3.8±0.2 dB relative to the quantum noise limit is ob-
served. Taking into account the detection eﬃciency we
infer an amplitude squeezing of -5.0±0.4 dB.

Next we generated and measured the polarization state
of a dim amplitude squeezed beam combined with a
strong coherent beam in the orthogonal polarization
mode. The seed light was then mainly launched into the
inactive polarization mode of the parametric cavity and

only a small amount into the squeezed mode. The mea-
sured spectral densities associated with the three Stokes
parameters are shown in Fig. 2b,c and d. Since the p-
polarized coherent beam was much more intense than

the s-polarized squeezed beam, the ˆS0 and ˆS1 parame-
ters are at the QNL. The ˆS2 parameter is squeezed by
-3.6±0.2 dB relative to the QNL, while the ˆS3 operator is
anti-squeezed +9.4±0.2 dB relative to the QNL. Taking
into account the detection eﬃciency, we infer squeezing
and anti-squeezing values of -4.6±0.4 dB and +10.0±0.4,
respectively.

IV. SUMMARY

We have demonstrated the generation of polarization
squeezed light using periodically poled KTP. We gener-
ated -3.6±0.2 dB squeezing in ˆS2 and +9.4±0.2 dB anti-
squeezing in ˆS3 using a dim amplitude squeezed beam
combined with a coherent beam. To ensure an eﬃcient
spatial mode overlap between the coherent state and the
squeezed state, both modes were deﬁned in the same cav-
ity in orthogonal polarization modes. We also produced
bright amplitude squeezing and measured -3.8±0.2 dB
squeezing. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst demonstra-
tion of squeezing at 1064 nm using PPKTP.

The integration of a double barrier resonant tunneling diode within a unipolar optical waveguide
provides electrical gain over a wide bandwidth. Due to the non-linearities introduced by the double
barrier resonant tunneling diode an unipolar InGaAlAs/InP optical waveguide can be employed both
as optical modulator and optical detector. The modeling results of a device operating as optical
modulator agree with preliminary experimental data, foreseeing for an optimized device modulation
depths up to 23 dB with chirp parameter between -1 and 0 in the wavelength range analyzed (1520
nm - 1600 nm).

INTRODUCTION

Due to their high-speed response and radio frequency
(rf) gain, several groups have proposed the application
of resonant tunnelling diodes (RTDs) in the optical and
infrared domains [1].

A novel optoelectronic device based on the integration
of a RTD with an optical waveguide (OW), the RTD-OW,
as been proposed for electro-optical and opto-electrical
conversion [2]. The waveguide conﬁguration is used to
ensure large interaction volume between the RTD re-
gions and the guided light. The full demonstration and
development of this new device concept in the ternary
AlGaAs/GaAs and quaternary InGaAlAs/InP material
systems can be of great importance for optical commu-
nication, specially in high-speed ﬁbre radio links. The
AlGaAs/GaAs material system is interesting for short
hall communications in the wavelength range around 900
nm, and the InGaAlAs/InP material system is useful in
the wavelength range where optical ﬁbres have the lowest
loss and chromatic dispersion (1300 nm to 1600 nm).

Our group has successfully integrated AlGaAs and
InGaAlAs RTDs within unipolar AlGaAs/GaAs and
respectively, and
InGaAlAs/InP optical waveguides,
demonstrated optical modulation of guided light around
900 nm and 1550 nm [3][4]. In this paper we report mod-
eling results of the device operating as an electro-optical
converter at 1550 nm, conﬁrms preliminary experimental
data [4][5].

II. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION AS A
MODULATOR

Essentially, the RTD-OW is a unipolar device consist-
ing of a double barrier quantum well (DBQW) resonant

tunneling diode (RTD) embedded within a ridge channel
optical waveguide. The DBQW-RTD structure consists
of two AlAs barriers surrounding a InGaAs quantum well.
The optical waveguide comprehends two moderately n-
doped InGaAlAs layers lattice matched to InP, sand-
wiched between highly n-doped InP cladding regions,
Fig. 1.

The presence of the DBQW-RTD within the waveguide
core introduces high nonlinearities in the current-voltage
(I-V) characteristic of the unipolar waveguide: the de-
vice I-V curve shows large negative diﬀerential resistance
(NDR), Fig. 2. The physics that gives rise to this type
of I-V is explained in [4].

FIG. 2: Experimental current-voltage characteristic of an
InGaAlAs/InP RTD-OW.

As a consequence of the presence of the RTD within
the unipolar waveguide core a non-uniform potential dis-
tribution is induced across the waveguide cross-section,
Fig. 3. The magnitude of the associated electric ﬁeld
distribution depends strongly on the bias voltage. When
the device operating point switches from the peak to the
valley regions of the I-V curve there is an enhancement
of the electric ﬁeld across the waveguide depletion re-
gion. This produces substantial changes in the absorp-
tion coeﬃcient of the waveguide at wavelengths near the
core material band-edge via the Franz-Keldysh eﬀect (for
more details see [4]). The operation of the RTD-OW as
an optical modulator takes advantage of this absorption
change induced by the RTD peak-to-valley switching.

Preliminary experimental results indicate that a non-
optimized device designed to act as a modulator is ca-
pable of high-speed modulation (up to 26 GHz) with ex-
tinction ratio higher than 10 dB over a wide range of
wavelengths at driving power as low as 7.7 dBm, Fig. 4
[5].

part, the waveguide optical properties induced changes
such as the extinction coeﬃcient and the refractive index
variations at diﬀerent bias voltage and as function of the
guided light wavelength are calculated.

The RTD-OW electrical modelling employs

the
WinGreen simulation package [6] that determines the de-
vice I-V characteristic and the potential proﬁles across
the waveguide cross-section as function of the applied
bias. The I-V curve permits to extract the NDR region
characteristics: the peak and the valley voltages, Fig. 5.

The electric ﬁeld distribution F (z) across the waveg-
uide for a given bias voltage V , Fig. 6b), is obtained
through the gradient of the potential distribution, Fig.
6a).

The waveguide absorption coeﬃcient at a given voltage
V is then determined as a function of the electric ﬁeld
distribution F (z), in V/cm, and of the light energy E, in
eV, using the Franz-Keldysh relation [7],

propagation loss. To achieve this purpose it is necessary
to maximize the electric ﬁeld change when the device op-
eration point switches from the peak to the valley region
and the overlap between the electric ﬁeld distribution and
the guided mode.

According the modeling results, the optimized modu-
lator structure corresponds to a RTD-OW conﬁguration
consisting of two 2 nm thick AlAs barriers surrounding a
6 nm thick InGaAlAs quantum well, symmetrically em-
bedded within a 300 mm unipolar InGaAlAs waveguide
core with doping concentration of 1 × 1016 cm−3 and
600 nm thick InP cladding layers highly doped (2 × 1018
cm−3). A 200 µm long RTD-OW shows extinction ratio
up to 23 dB around 1560 nm with chirp parameter of
-0.25, Fig. 7. The results also show the propagation loss
are considerable higher than the “best” values reported
in the literature. The way to decrease the propagation
loss are under current investigation.

where Fp,v represents the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld

The objective of this work is to understand the role
of the structural and material parameters on the device
performance in order to determine the optimized device
structure for each application. The study reported here
aims the determination of the RTD-OW structure that
gives the highest modulation depth with the minimum

The refractive index change and the extinction coef-
ﬁcient variation are shown in Fig. 8, and appears to
indicate the RTD-OW has high potential to operate as
an electro-refraction modulator through an interferome-
ter conﬁguration.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

4

The modeling results corroborate preliminary modu-
lation depth experimental data [4][5]. The fabrication
of devices based on the present optimized structures is
being considered.

The current devices also show detection capabilities.
Its is foreseen the device can operate as a light detec-
tor incorporating an intrinsic integrated ampliﬁer for the
photocurrent generated by the incident light. The pre-
sented model is currently being extended to include the
eﬀect of light absorption.

We analyze the rates of noise-induced transitions between period-two attractors. The model investigated
is an underdamped oscillator parametrically driven by a ﬁeld at nearly twice the oscillator eigenfrequency.
The activation energy of the transitions is analyzed as a function of the frequency detuning and ﬁeld
amplitude scaled by the damping and nonlinearity parameters of the oscillator. The parameter ranges
where the system is bi- and tristable are investigated. Explicit results are obtained in the limit of small
damping (or strong driving), and near bifurcation points.

I. INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear systems driven by a suﬃciently strong pe-
riodic ﬁeld often display period doubling [1]. The two
emerging stable periodic states are the same: the only
diﬀerence between them is that they are shifted in time
by the period of the force 2π/ωF . This feature is a con-
sequence of the symmetry with respect to translation in
time by 2π/ωF , and it has attracted much attention to
such systems as elements of digital computers.
In the
presence of noise, there occur ﬂuctuational transitions
between the period-two attractors, which correspond to
phase slip of the system by π. Such transitions have
been observed recently for electrons oscillating in a Pen-
ning trap [2]. They have been also investigated in an
analog electronic circuit [3], in the context of stochastic
resonance [4].

Motivated by these observations, in the present paper
we develop a theory of escape rates from period-two at-
tractors. The analysis is done for the simplest generic
model that displays period doubling: an underdamped
oscillator parametrically driven by a force at nearly twice
the oscillator eigenfrequency ω0 [5]. This model applies,
in particular, to axial vibrations of an electron in a Pen-
ning trap [2]. Much work on a parametrically excited os-
cillator has been done in the context of squeezed states of
light, cf. [6]. We analyze escape due to classical ﬂuctua-
tions, which were substantial for the systems investigated
in [2,3].

Parametrically excited oscillator is an example of a sys-
tem away from thermal equilibrium. Such systems usu-
ally lack detailed balance [7], they are not characterized
by free energy, and escape rates depend on the system
dynamics and the noise that gives rise to ﬂuctuations
in the system. In the important and quite general case
where the noise is Gaussian, there has been developed a
technique which reduces the problem of calculating es-
cape rates to a variational problem [8]. The solution of
this problem describes the optimal path along which the
ﬂuctuating system is most likely to move when it escapes.
Such path is often called the most probable escape path

(MPEP) [9]. The value of the variational functional gives
the exponent in the expression for the escape rate.

An advantageous feature of the problem of period dou-
bling in an underdamped oscillator is that the period
doubling occurs for comparatively small amplitudes F of
the driving force, where the nonlinearity of the oscillator
is still small: the anharmonic part of the potential energy
0q2/2. In this case,
is much less than the quadratic term ω2
the quantities of interest are the amplitude and phase of
ω0. They vary
the vibrations at the frequency ωF /2
−1
only a little over the time
F . The corresponding
∼
dynamics is aﬀected by Fourier components of the noise
within a narrow band centered at ωF /2. Essentially, this
means that, in the analysis of the dynamics of slow vari-
ables, the noise may be assumed white. A similar situa-
tion arises [10] in the problem of transitions between the
stable states of forced vibrations of a resonantly driven
underdamped oscillator.

Below in Sec. II we provide the results on the the phase
portrait of the oscillator in the rotating frame, derive the
properties of noise for slow variables, and, for low noise
intensities, formulate the variational problem for the ac-
tivation energy of escape. In Sec. III we provide explicit
expressions for the escape rates in the following parame-
ter ranges: vicinities of the bifurcation points where pe-
riod two attractors emerge and where there emerge two
unstable period two states, and the range of compara-
tively strong driving where the motion in slow variables
is underdamped. In Sec. IV numerical results for the gen-
eral case are discussed and compared with the results for
the limiting cases. Sec. V contains concluding remarks.

II. ASYMPTOTIC EXPRESSION FOR THE
ESCAPE RATES

A. Phase portrait in slow variables

To set the scene, we will ﬁrst discuss the phase por-
trait of a parametrically driven underdamped oscillator.

Here, Γ is the friction coeﬃcient, γ is the nonlinearity
parameter, F is the amplitude of the regular force, and
ξ(t) is a zero-mean noise,
= 0. The eﬀect of cubic

nonlinearity in the Hamiltonian of the oscillator can be
taken into account by renormalizing the parameter γ (cf.
[5]). The results can be also easily generalized to the case
where, for special reasons [2], γ is numerically small, and
q5 in the equation
it is necessary to allow for the term
of motion.

B. Noise in the equations for slow variables

In many cases of physical interest, the noise ξ(t) driv-
ing the oscillator is Gaussian. This noise may originate
from the coupling to a thermal bath (which also gives
rise to the friction force in Eq. (1)), or it may be due to
an external nonthermal source. A zero-mean Gaussian
noise is characterized by its power spectrum

For a stationary noise the power spectrum (8) is indepen-

φ(ω) is smooth near the oscillator eigenfrequency ω0.

The noises ξ1,2(t) in Eq. (4) are nonstationary, gener-
ally speaking. One obtains from Eqs. (1), (3), (4) the
following expressions for their power spectra:

It follows from Eq. (9) that the spectra of the diagonal
have both time-independent and
correlators
fast-oscillating in time components, whereas the power
spectrum of the cross-correlator of ξ1, ξ2 is fast oscillat-
ing in time. Therefore, in the analysis of the eﬀect of the
noise on the slowly varying functions q1,2, in the spirit
of the averaging method, one can assume that the noise
components ξ1(t), ξ2(t) are asymptotically independent
of each other; one can also leave out the terms
cos ωF t
in the power spectra of the diagonal correlators (cf. [10]
where the analysis was done for a microscopic model of
noise resulting from coupling to a bath; rigorous math-
ematical results on the method of averaging in noise-
driven systems are discussed in [11]).

(the function ˜δ(x) is of the type of a δ-function: it is large

1, and its integral is equal to 1).

The quantity D gives the characteristic intensity of the
noise in the equations of motion for slow variables q1, q2
(4). In particular, if the oscillator is coupled to a thermal
bath with the correlation time much smaller than 1/ω0,
so that it performs a “truly” Brownian motion, and the
random force ξ(t) in Eq. (1) is δ-correlated, with intensity
4ΓkT , we have D = 3
F Γ. We note, however,
that the dynamics of slow variables can be described as
Brownian motion even where this description does not
apply to the motion of the initial oscillator, i.e. where the
correlation time of the thermal bath is >
1/ω0. In this
∼
latter case, the friction force in Eq. (1) is also retarded
(cf. [10]).

C. Activation energy of escape

If the dimensionless noise intensity D is small, for most
of the time the oscillator ﬂuctuates in a small vicinity
of one or the other stable state q(n)
st . Only occasionally
there occurs a large ﬂuctuation which results in a tran-
sition to another stable state. The probability Wn of
such ﬂuctuation is exponentially small, and its depen-
dence on the noise intensity is given by the activation
Sn/D) (see [8] for a review). In fact,
law, Wn ∝
to logarithmic accuracy Wn is determined by the prob-
ability density of the least improbable realization of the
force ξ(τ /Γ) which results in the corresponding transi-
tion. Therefore the quantity Sn is given by the solution

of a variational problem. This problem is of the form (cf.
[10,11]):

III. ACTIVATION ENERGY OF ESCAPE IN THE
VICINITIES OF THE BIFURCATION POINTS

The activation energies Sn, as deﬁned by (11), depend
on two dimensionless parameters of the driven oscillator:
the scaled ﬁeld strength ζ and the scaled frequency de-
tuning Ω (6). In the general case, Sn may be calculated
numerically (see Sec. VI). Explicit expressions for Sn can
be obtained in several limiting cases.

In the range of comparatively small nonlinearity (7),
the oscillator may experience two bifurcations with the
varying ﬁeld frequency, as seen from Fig. 1. In the vicin-
ity of a bifurcation point, one of the motions of the system
near the emerging stable state(s) becomes slow: there
arises a “soft mode” [14]. Correspondingly, ﬂuctuations
near a bifurcation point have universal features [15].

Near a bifurcation point one can either solve the vari-
ational problem (11) explicitly or reduce the system of
equations of motion (4) to one ﬁrst order equation. From
this equation one can ﬁnd not only the exponent, but also
the prefactor in the expression for the escape rate.

The equation for a slow variable Q can be derived from

(4) by appropriately rotating the coordinates:

(ΩB are the bifurcation values of the dimensionless fre-

0 the
dimensionless relaxation time of the variable Q goes to
inﬁnity, whereas that of P is 1/2, and therefore P (τ )
follows the slow variable Q(τ ) adiabatically [15]. The
ﬂuctuations in P can be neglected compared to the ﬂuc-
tuations in Q. Using the adiabatic solution for P (i.e.,
neglecting ˙P and the noise term in the equation for ˙P )
we obtain the following equation for Q:

tion of a particle with the coordinate q1 and momentum

particle moves along closed trajectories shown in Fig. 2

The conservative motion (16) depends only on one pa-

between the frequency detuning and the ﬁeld strength.
The shape of the eﬀective energy G(X, Y ) for two diﬀer-
ent values of µ is shown in Fig. 3. The trajectories in
Fig. 2 are just the cross-sections of the surface G(X, Y )
by planes G =const. The extrema of the surface G(X, Y )
are the ﬁxed points of the system.

tion G(X, Y ) has two maxima at X = 0, Y =

dle point at X = Y = 0. For µ > 1, in addition to the
above maxima the function G(X, Y ) has a minimum at
X = Y = 0 (the maxima and the minimum correspond to
the stable states of the oscillator), and two saddle points

B. Escape rates

The eﬀect of small dissipation in Eqs. (4) is to trans-
form the closed trajectories in Fig. 2 into small-step spi-
rals which wind down to the corresponding stable states

(cf. Fig. 1). The motion can be described in a standard
way in terms of slow drift over the energy g towards the
stable state (cf. [1]).

The random force which drives the system away from
the stable state should “beat” this drift. It would be ex-
pected that the optimal ﬂuctuational path corresponds
to energy diﬀusion away from the stable state. A solu-
tion of the variational problem (11) for small dissipation
was obtained in [10] for a diﬀerent form of the function
g(q1, q2). Alternatively, one can use the approach ﬁrst
suggested by Kramers [16] in the analysis of escape of un-
derdamped thermal equilibrium systems. This approach
is equivalent to deriving from Eqs. (4) an equation for ˙g
and averaging the dissipative term and the noise inten-
sity in this equation over the period of vibrations with
a given g in the absence of dissipation and noise. The
dissipative term (the dissipation rate of g) is then given
by the expression
[q1(∂g/∂q1) + q2(∂g/∂q2)], with an
accuracy to the correction
D (here, overline means
∝
averaging over the vibration period). The diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient for g is given by D[∂g/∂q1)2 + (∂g/∂q2)2]. The
resulting ﬁrst order equation for g can be solved to give
the following expression for the activation energy:

The values of Gn (n =1,2) and Gu are the extreme val-
ues of G(X, Y ) as given by Eq. (17). The double inte-
grals in (18) are taken over the areas A(G) limited by
the trajectories G(X, Y ) = G in Fig. 2 which surround
the nth center (the expressions for M (G), N (G) were ob-
tained from the expressions for the drift and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients for g using the Stocks theorem, with account
taken of Eqs.(16), as it was done in [10]).

The expressions for M (G), N (G) (18) can be fur-
ther simpliﬁed by changing to polar coordinates X =
R cos ϕ, Y = R sin ϕ. Solving Eq. (16) for R2 in terms of

C. Explicit limiting expressions for the escape rates

±

The expressions for the activation energies are simpli-
ﬁed near bifurcation points (yet not too close to the bifur-
cation points, so that the damping of the vibrations with
a given g (16) be small compared to their frequency).
These bifurcation points are µ =

As the increasing µ goes through the value µ =
1,
the maximum of the function G(X, Y ) at X = Y = 0
becomes a saddle point from which there are split oﬀ two
maxima of G corresponding to period two attractors (see
Fig. 3). With the further increase in µ, for µ = 1 the
point X = Y = 0 becomes a minimum of G(X, Y ) from
which there are split oﬀ two saddles of G. Escape from
the emerging stable states is determined by small-radius
orbits G(X, Y ) = G. For such orbits M (G)/N (G)

are exponentially smaller than from the state where the
vibrations are not excited. As a consequence, the station-
ary population of the period two attractors w1 = w2 is
exponentially larger than the population w0 of the steady
state:
w1 = w2 = (W0/2W1)w0, w1/w0 ∝

exp[(S1 −

S0)/D].

(25)

For larger frequency detuning (Ω = µζ), the steady
state becomes more populated, in agreement with the
intuitive physical argument that, as the ﬁeld is detuned
further away from the resonance, it is less likely that the
period two vibrations will be excited, for the same ﬁeld
intensity.

V. EFFECTS OF THE SIXTH-ORDER
ANHARMONIC TERM

In the experiments [2], because of the structure of the
electrostatic ﬁeld in the trap for an oscillating electron,
the 6th order anharmonic term in the Hamiltonian of the
electron vibrations could be relatively large (in fact, the
4th order term could be relatively small), while higher-
order terms remain much smaller than both the 4th and
6th order terms [17]. The advantage of suppressing the
4th order term is that the amplitude of the period-two
vibrations becomes larger. When the 6th order anhar-
monicity is taken into account, the equation of motion
takes the form

d2q

+ ω2

0q + γq3 + λq5 + qF cos ωF t = ξ(t)

(26)

For the model (26), the equations of motion in the
rotating frame are again of the form (4), but now the
function g(q1, q2) is given by the expression

We have neglected the renormalization (
linearity parameter parameter λ (this renormalization is
substantial when γ is not small, in which case the role
of the 6th order anharmonicity is insigniﬁcant, or the
whole approximation of small-amplitude vibrations does
not apply). The dimensionless parameter ρ characterizes
the “strength” of the 6th order nonlinearity.
For Ω very close to the bifurcation values

escape from the small-amplitude stable state(s) is deter-
mined by the motion with small q2

ity, and therefore neither this motion nor the bifurcation
values of the parameters are aﬀected by the higher-order
nonlinear terms.

In what follows we will investigate the eﬀect of the
λ in (26) on the escape rates from the period
term
two attractors, and also from the zero amplitude stable
state for Ω > (ζ2
1)1/2, far from the bifurcation points.
We will analyze the case of weak damping, which is of
utmost interest for the experiment [17].

In the neglect of dissipation and ﬂuctuations, the mo-
tion of the oscillator (26) in the rotating frame can be
described by Eqs. (16), but when the 6th order nonlin-
earity is taken into account, the eﬀective energy G(X, Y )
is of the form

For ρ > 0 (i.e., for γλ > 0 in Eq. (26)), the phase
portrait of the conservative motion (16), (28) remains
qualitatively the same as that shown in Figs. 2a,b for
ρ = 0, as does also the topological structure of the sur-
face G(X, Y ) in Fig. 3. The centers which correspond
to the period two attractors lie on the Y -axis, X1,2 = 0,
they correspond to the maxima of the function G(X, Y ),
whereas the hyperbolic points which correspond to the
unstable period two states lie on the X-axis, Yu1,2 = 0;
they correspond to the saddles of G(X, Y ).

The general expression for the activation energy of es-
cape Sn is given by Eq. (18), but now the functions M (G)
and N (G) have to be calculated with account taken of
the 6th order terms in G(X, Y ) (28). In particular,

A. Activation energies of escape near bifurcation
points

For underdamped systems where the sixth order an-
harmonicity, the analysis of the activation energies of es-
cape for parameter values close to the bifurcation points
is similar to that in Sec. IV C. In the range 0 < µ+1
1
the centers (X1,2, Y1,2)) which correspond to the period
two attractors are close to the saddle point at the origin.
In this case R±
1 in Eqs. (31), and the terms with
X 2 + Y 2 in Eq. (29) can be neglected. These terms can
be also neglected in the problem of escape from the sta-
ble state X = Y = 0 for 0 < µ + 1
1, as in this case
the hyperbolic points (Xu1,2, Yu1,2) are close to the sta-
ble state. Therefore, in both cases, M (G)/N (G)

It follows from Eqs. (27), (36), (42) that, in the limit of
large sixth-order nonlinearity, the fourth-order nonlinear-
ity parameter γ drops out of the expressions for the ac-
tivation energies ˜Sn, the reduced noise intensity ˜D, and
the escape rates. This is in agreement with Eq. (35),
ρ−1/2 for large ρ, and
which shows explicitly that Sn ∝
therefore ˜Sn = ρ1/2Sn is independent of γ.

It is clear from the asymptotic expressions (35), (43)
that the activation energy of escape from the period two
attractors ˜S1,2 is a nonmonotonic function of µ, i.e. of
2ω0. The decrease of ˜S1,2
the frequency detuning ωF −
for large µ can be understood as follows. As we men-
tioned before, the eﬀective reciprocal “temperature” of
the distribution of the system over the energy G, which
is given by the M/N = ˜M / ˜N , is determined by the ra-
tio of the rates of the drift and diﬀusion of the oscillator
over G (for a Brownian particle this ratio is indeed equal
to 1/kT ). The drift coeﬃcient is linear in the charac-
teristic velocity ˙X, ˙Y of the oscillator in rotating frame,
whereas the diﬀusion is quadratic in this velocity. There-
fore when the velocity is large, the ratio M/N becomes
small. This happens for large µ. Here, the characteristic
time scale for the motion with a given G is set by the
reciprocal frequency detuning 1/
, and the ra-
2ω0|
1/µ. On the other hand, the
ωF −
tio M/N

∝
Gu for large µ is increasing with µ
energy interval G1 −
sublinearly, if the sixth order nonlinearity is dominating
(and linearly, if the fourth order nonlinearity is dominat-
ing). Therefore, for large ρ and µ the activation energy
decreases with the increasing µ.

FIG. 3. The Hamiltonian function G(X, Y ) (16) (a) for
µ = 0.5 where the function G has two maxima (which corre-
spond to period two attractors, with account taken of dissi-
pation) and a saddle point at X = Y = 0, and (b) for µ = 2.0
where G has two maxima, a minimum at X = Y = 0, and two
saddles which correspond to unstable period two vibrations,
with account taken of dissipation.

FIG. 2. Trajectories of the conservative motion (16) for (a)
µ = 0.5 and (b) µ = 2.0. The values of the Hamiltonian
function G(X, Y ) are shown near the trajectories. The dots
show the positions of the centers and the hyperbolic points.

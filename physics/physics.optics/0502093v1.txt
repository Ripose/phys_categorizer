Parameterizing Quasiperiodicity: Generalized
Poisson Summation and Its Application to
Modiﬁed-Fibonacci Antenna Arrays

Vincenzo Galdi, Giuseppe Castaldi, Vincenzo Pierro,
Innocenzo M. Pinto, and Leopold B. Felsen ∗

Abstract

The fairly recent discovery of “quasicrystals”, whose X-ray diﬀrac-
tion patterns reveal certain peculiar features which do not conform
with spatial periodicity, has motivated studies of the wave-dynamical
implications of “aperiodic order”. Within the context of the radiation
properties of antenna arrays, an instructive novel (canonical) exam-
ple of wave interactions with quasiperiodic order is illustrated here for
one-dimensional (1-D) array conﬁgurations based on the “modiﬁed-
Fibonacci” sequence, with utilization of a two-scale generalization of
the standard Poisson summation formula for periodic arrays. This
allows for a “quasi-Floquet” analytic parameterization of the radiated
ﬁeld, which provides instructive insights into some of the basic wave
mechanisms associated with quasiperiodic order, highlighting similar-
ities and diﬀerences with the periodic case. Examples are shown for
quasiperiodic inﬁnite and spatially-truncated arrays, with brief dis-
cussion of computational issues and potential applications.

1 Introduction

The recent discovery (1984) of “quasicrystals”, i.e., certain metallic alloys
whose X-ray diﬀraction patterns contain bright spots displaying symme-
tries (e.g., 5-fold) which are incompatible with spatial periodicity [1], [2],
has stimulated a growing interest in the study of aperiodic order and its
wave-dynamical properties.

In electromagnetics (EM) engineering, use of random or deterministic
aperiodic geometries has been customary within the framework of antenna
array thinning [3]–[5], whereas multiperiod conﬁgurations have recently been
proposed for optimizing the passband/stopband characteristics of frequency
selective surfaces [6] and photonic bandgap (PBG) devices [7].
In [8], we
explored the radiation properties of two-dimensional (2-D) antenna arrays
based on the concept of “aperiodic tiling” [9], [10], which had previously
found interesting applications in the ﬁeld of PBG devices (see the brief sum-
mary and references in [8]).

In this paper, we turn our attention to the radiation properties of a dif-
ferent category of aperiodic structures consisting of two-scale Fibonacci-type
sequences [11]. Materials exhibiting this type of aperiodic order, technically
called “quasiperiodicity” (see the deﬁnition in Sec. 2.2), were ﬁrst fabricated
in 1985 as GaAs-AlAs heterostructures (1-D multilayers) [12]; their techni-
cal classiﬁcation as “quasicrystals” is still debated [13]. The wave-dynamical
properties of 1-D and 2-D Fibonacci-type structures have been widely investi-
gated, theoretically and experimentally, in quantum mechanics, acoustics and
EM (see [14]–[26] for a sparse sampling). Particularly interesting outcomes
concern the self-similar fractal (Cantor-type) nature of the eigenspectra [14],
[16], [20], and the possible presence of bandgaps [19], [21], omnidirectional
reﬂection properties [22], [25], and localization phenomena [14], [18], [23].

Here, we concentrate on the study of the radiation properties of a simple
class of 1-D antenna arrays based on the so-called “modiﬁed-Fibonacci” se-
quence. This novel prototype array conﬁguration appears particularly well
suited to exploration of some basic characteristics of wave interactions with
quasiperiodic order. First, this array model is amenable to analytic parame-
terization via a generalized Poisson summation formula, by exploiting some
recent results in [27] (this paper is easily accessible through the web). Note
that, in principle, one can derive generalized Poisson summation formulas
that accommodate a variety of “nonperiodicity scales” (see, e.g., [28]). Here,
we consider only two scales, d1 and d2. This opens up the possibility of

2

extending the Floquet-based parameterization of inﬁnite and semi-inﬁnite
time-harmonic periodic arrays in [29], [30] to the case of two-scale quasiperi-
odic arrays. Next, the inherent degree of freedom in the choice of the ratio
between the two scales can be used to study the “transition” from periodic
= d2) order, so as to better understand the
(d1 = d2) to quasiperiodic (d1 6
quasiperiodicity-induced footprints in the wave dynamics. Finally, although
the main focus of this preliminary investigation is on wave-dynamical phe-
nomenologies, computational and applicational issues for a test example are
brieﬂy addressed as well, including possible exploitation of the two-scale de-
gree of freedom for pattern control in practical applications.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the problem geometry is
described, and the modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence is introduced together with
general aspects of quasiperiodicity.
In Section 3, the generalized Poisson
summation formula for modiﬁed-Fibonacci arrays is introduced, and its sim-
ilarities and diﬀerences with the periodic case are discussed. In Section 4, a
“quasi-Floquet” (QF) parameterization of the radiated ﬁeld for inﬁnite and
semi-inﬁnite modiﬁed-Fibonacci arrays is derived, paralleling [29], [30]. Nu-
merical results and potential applications are illustrated in Section 5, followed
by brief concluding remarks in Section 6.

2 Background and Problem Formulation

2.1 Geometry

Referring to the geometry depicted in Fig. 1, we begin with an inﬁnite phased
line array of z-directed electric dipoles, subject to uniform unit-amplitude
time-harmonic exp(jωt) excitation, described by the current distribution

spacings d1 and d2 ≤

2.2 Modiﬁed-Fibonacci Sequence: An Example of

Quasiperiodic Order

The Fibonacci sequence [11], introduced in 1202 by the Italian mathemati-
cian Leonardo da Pisa (Fibonacci) (ca. 1170–ca. 1240), in connection with
a model for rabbit breeding, is probably the earliest and most thoroughly
investigated deterministic aperiodic sequence. Since then, it has found ap-
plications in many diﬀerent ﬁelds, owing to its intimate relation with one of
the most pervasive mathematical entities, the Golden Mean [11]. In its sim-
plest version, the Fibonacci sequence can be generated from a two-symbol
alphabet

, by iteratively applying the substitution rules

{

Note that the string at each iteration is obtained as the concatenation of
the two preceding ones (sn = sn
sn
2). The process can be iterated ad
inﬁnitum, yielding an inﬁnite sequence of “a” and “b” symbols which seems
to display no apparent regularity, but actually hides a wealth of interesting
properties (see [11] for details). For instance, in the limit of an inﬁnite
sequence, it can be shown that the ratio between the numbers of “a” and
“b” symbols (Na and Nb, respectively) approaches the Golden Mean τ =
(1 + √5)/2 [11],

In connection with the antenna array problem of interest here, there are
several ways of embedding the above-introduced Fibonacci-type aperiodic
sequence. One possibility would be keeping the geometry periodic (i.e., uni-
form inter-element spacing) and associating with the “a” and “b” symbols in
the Fibonacci sequence two possible current amplitudes. Another possibil-
ity, pursued in this investigation, assumes uniform excitation and associates
the “a” and “b” symbols with two possible inter-element spacings, d1 and
d1, respectively (see Fig. 1). Accordingly, the dipole positions zm in
d2 ≤
(1) can be obtained from the symbolic strings in (3) or, in an equivalent and

Following [27], the particular case d2 = d1/τ in (5) will be referred to as
“standard Fibonacci”. The general case, in which the scale ratio ν = d2/d1
is left as a degree of freedom, will be referred to as “modiﬁed Fibonacci”,
and represents one of the simplest extensions of the Fibonacci sequence. The
reader is referred to [28], [31], [32] for other examples of possible exten-
sions/generalizations.

Note that the modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence in (5) includes as a limit the
periodic case (d1 = d2). It can be proved that, with the exception of this de-
generate case, the sequence in (5) and the corresponding dipole distribution
in (1) display a “quasiperiodic” character, which represents one of the most
common and best known forms of aperiodic order. The concept of quasiperi-
odicity stems from the theory of “almost-periodic” functions developed by
H. Bohr during the 1920s [33], [34].
In essence, a quasiperiodic function
can be uniformly approximated by a generalized Fourier series containing a
countable inﬁnity of pairwise incommensurate frequencies generated from a
ﬁnite-dimensional basis (see [33], [34] for more details).

It follows from (4) that, in the inﬁnite-sequence limit, the average inter-

element spacing dav is [27]

dav =

τ d1 + d2
1 + τ

.

(7)

Anticipating the analytic derivations and parametric analysis in Secs. 3 and
4, it is expedient to parameterize the sequence in (5) in terms of the average
spacing dav in (7) and the scale ratio ν = d2/d1, rewriting d1 and d2 as

d1 =

(1 + τ )
(ν + τ )

dav,

d2 = νd1, 0 < ν

1.

(8)

≤

The modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence in (5) admits an instructive alternative
interpretation in terms of a “cut-and-project” graphic construction [27], as il-
lustrated in Fig. 2. Cut-and-project schemes are systematic tools for generat-
ing quasiperiodic sets via projection from higher-dimensional periodic lattices

5

(see [10] for details). In our case, one starts from a 2-D square lattice of side
d0 = d1√1 + ν2 traversed by a straight line with slope tan φ0 = 1/τ . Those
lattice points whose “Vorono¨i cell” [10] (light-shaded square cell of side d0
centered around the point, in Fig. 2) is crossed by the line (or, equivalently,
those falling within the rectangular window of size h = d0(1 + τ )/√2 + τ
centered around the line, in Fig. 2) are orthogonally projected onto another
straight line (z-axis in Fig. 2) with slope tan φ = ν to yield the desired
modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence in (5). For the standard-Fibonacci sequence
(ν = 1/τ ), the two lines coincide (φ = φ0) and the above scheme becomes
equivalent to the canonical cut-and-project scheme described in [10].

3 Generalized Poisson Summation Formula

For periodic structures, Floquet theory provides a rigorous and powerful
framework for spectral- or spatial-domain analytic and numerical analysis.
In this connection, the Poisson summation formula [35] can be utilized to sys-
tematically recast ﬁeld observables as superpositions of either individual or
collective contributions. Problem-matched extensions have also been devel-
oped to accommodate typical departures from perfect periodicity in realistic
structures, such as truncation (ﬁniteness) and smooth perturbations in the
spatial period as well as in the excitation (tapering) [36]–[39].

Considering the degenerate periodic limiting case (d1 = d2 = d, i.e., zm =
md) of the modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence in (5), the corresponding periodic
limit f (per) of the current distribution in (1) can be recast, via the standard
Poisson summation formula [35], as

(9b)

The m-indexed individual dipole contributions in (9a) are thereby recast into
the inﬁnite superposition of linearly smoothly-phased q-indexed equivalent
line source distributions in (9b). Remarkably, a similar re-parameterization
is always possible for the general (i.e., quasiperiodic) case of the modiﬁed-
Fibonacci sequence in (5), since it can be shown that the spatial Fourier

Equation (13) thus represents a generalization of the standard Poisson sum-
mation formula for periodic arrays in (9) to the more general quasiperiodic
modiﬁed-Fibonacci array in (5), and will accordingly be referred to as gen-
eralized Poisson summation formula. It is readily veriﬁed that for the special
case of periodic arrays (d1 = d2 = d, i.e., ν = 1), one obtains

dav = d, Wq1q2 = (q1 −

q2)π, Sq1q2 = δq1q2,

(14)

with δq1q2 denoting the Kronecker delta, and thus (13) reduces to the standard
Poisson summation formula in (9b).

A few observations are in order to highlight similarities and diﬀerences
between (13) and (9). Similar to (9), the individual dipole contributions in

7

(5) are recast via (13) as a superposition of collective contributions arising
from linearly smoothly-phased equivalent line source distributions. However,
at variance with the q-indexed single inﬁnity of equispaced spatial frequen-
cies in (9b), the generalized Poisson summation formula in (13) entails a
(q1, q2)-indexed double inﬁnity of generally pairwise-incommensurate spatial
frequencies. This could be expected recalling the deﬁnition of the quasiperi-
odic functions given in Sec. 2.2. Note that the spatial frequencies kzq1q2 in
(12) depend on the average inter-element spacing dav, but are independent
of the scale ratio ν = d2/d1. The dependence on ν shows up (via Wq1q2) in
the amplitude coeﬃcients Sq1q2 in (11), which are not constant as for the pe-
riodic case in (9b). It is worth pointing out that such dependence is smooth,
and consequently no abrupt transition occurs when ν is varied between ratio-
nal and irrational values, i.e., going from commensurate to incommensurate
scales d1 and d2. However, for case of commensurate scales,

ν =

=

d2
d1

, p1, p2 ∈

N,

one can readily verify that

kz(q1+M p1)(q2+M p2) = kzq1q2 + M

W(q1+M p1)(q2+M p2) = Wq1q2, M

,

p2(cid:19)

and thus the array spectrum in (10b) is periodic with period 2πp2/d1. It can
be veriﬁed that the opposite implication is also true, and thus the spectrum
is periodic if and only if the scales d1 and d2 are commensurate, although
the array remains aperiodic in physical space [27].

4 Radiated Field

In order to further explore possible similarities and diﬀerences between the
wave phenomenologies associated with periodicity and quasiperiodicity, it is
instructive to consider the radiated ﬁelds. To this end, in what follows, we
extend the Floquet-based frequency-domain analysis in [29], [30], for inﬁ-
nite and semi-inﬁnite periodic phased arrays of dipoles, to the quasiperiodic
modiﬁed-Fibonacci case. As in [29], [30], attention is restricted to the z-
directed vector potential A(r) = A(r)uz, with r
(z, ρ) and with uz denot-
ing a z-directed unit vector, from which all ﬁeld quantities of interest can be

computed. Whenever applicable, partial results from [29], [30] are recalled
and used, without going into the details of the technical derivations.

4.1

Inﬁnite Arrays

For inﬁnite arrays, proceding analogous to [29], the generalized Poisson sum-
mation formula in (13) can be used to recast the element-by-element (spher-
ical wave) synthesis of the ﬁeld potential,

In the (q1, q2)-plane, the propagating spectral range in (21) is mapped into
an inﬁnite strip, thus indicating the general presence of an inﬁnite number of
propagating QF waves. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, for a nonphased (η = 0)
array with dav = 1.1λ0 and various values of the scale ratio ν = d2/d1.
Also shown, for comparison, is the periodic case (Fig. 4(a)), which entails
a ﬁnite number of propagating Floquet waves. In the general quasiperiodic
case, it is observed that the propagating spectral range is vastly populated,
irrespective of the commensurate (Fig. 4(b)) or incommensurate (Fig. 4(c))
character of the scales d1 and d2. However, it follows from (11) that moving
toward large values of q1, q2 (with opposite sign), the amplitude coeﬃcients

trivial periodic case (Fig. 5(a)), one observes highly-populated spectra, which
display perfect periodicity in the case of commensurate scales (Fig. 5(b)) and
only some loose repetitiveness otherwise (Fig. 5(c)). In both cases, a vast
majority of the spatial frequencies have amplitude coeﬃcients signiﬁcantly
smaller (.

Note that evanescent (

tions at observation points far from the array axis, but they excite propa-
gating diﬀracted ﬁelds that need to be taken into account. As in [30] (see
the discussion after Eq. (35) there), these contributions are approximated
via nonuniform asymptotics (F
1 in (26)). We point out that, at variance
with the periodic array case (cf. Eq. (36) in [30]), it is not possible here to
recast the total spherical wave diﬀracted ﬁeld in a more manageable form.

5 Results and Potential Applications

Although our main interest in this preliminary investigation is focused on
wave-dynamical phenomenologies associated with radiation from quasiperi-
odic antenna arrays, we brieﬂy discuss some computational and applicational
aspects with the hope of providing further insights. We stress that no at-
tempt has been made at this stage to devise optimal computational schemes,
nor do we deal with actual fabrication-oriented issues (feeding, matching,
inter-element coupling, etc.).

5.1 Numerical Results

From a computational viewpoint, the actual utility of the QF syntheses
in Sec. 4 (double summations involving an inﬁnite number of propagating
waves) might appear questionable as compared with brute-force element-by-
element synthesis. However, as observed in Sec. 4.1 (see also Fig. 5), under
appropriate conditions, a large number of propagating QF waves could be
weakly excited, thus suggesting the possibility, yet to be explored, of devising
eﬀective truncation schemes. Here, we try to quantify some of these aspects
via numerical examples. We begin by considering a 101-element nonphased
standard-Fibonacci array (η = 0, ν = 1/τ ,
50 in (1)). The truncated
QF synthesis developed in Sec. 4.2 for a semi-inﬁnite array can readily be

exploited here by expressing the ﬁnite array interval as the diﬀerence be-
tween two overlapping semi-inﬁnite intervals. Figure 6 shows the near-ﬁeld
(R = 100λ0) QF synthesis results for dav = 0.5λ0, using the crudest possible
truncation criterion based on retaining Np dominant propagating QF waves
in (23). Also shown, as a reference solution, is the element-by-element syn-
thesis in (17) (with
50). It is observed that the QF synthesis with
Np = 9 propagating waves provides reasonably good agreement, and even
Np = 3 is still capable of ﬂeshing out most of the waveﬁeld structure. Sim-
ilar statements can be made for the far-ﬁeld pattern in Fig. 7.
In order
to better quantify the accuracy, and address convergence issues, we have
computed the r.m.s. error

where the subscripts “RS” and “QF ” denote the reference solution and the QF
synthesis, respectively. Figure 8 shows the error behavior vs. the number Np
of dominant propagating QF waves retained, for near-ﬁeld synthesis (results
for the far-ﬁeld are practically identical). Also shown, for comparison, are
results obtained by retaining a number Ne = Np of dominant evanescent QF
10) of QF waves
diﬀracted waves. It is observed that a moderate number (
is capable of providing acceptable accuracy (∆A
20dB). The contribu-
tion of Ne retained evanescent QF diﬀracted waves is practically negligible
for Ne . 20, but can give observable improvements at larger Ne-values. Intu-
itively, one would expect the convergence behavior to improve in the presence
of weaker aperiodicity (ν
1) and smaller average inter-element spacing, and
viceversa. This is conﬁrmed by the results shown in Fig. 9, for two values
of the inter-element spacing (dav = 0.5λ0 and 0.75λ0) and three values of the
scale ratio (ν = 0.9, 0.75 and 1/τ ).

To sum up, the above results seem to indicate that moderate-size QF
syntheses, truncated by using even crude criteria, can still be capable of
capturing the dominant features of the relevant wave dynamics. However,
besides the computational convenience, which can become questionable if
highly accurate results are needed, the QF parameterization can oﬀer valu-
able insights for judicious exploitation of the inherent degree of freedom (scale
ratio ν = d2/d1) in the array (see, e.g., Sec. 5.2).

5.2 Potential Applications

In view the discrete character of its spectrum (see (10b)), the modiﬁed-
Fibonacci array in (1) does not oﬀer particular advantages within the frame-
work of array thinning, as compared with periodic arrays. In this connection,
other 1-D aperiodic sequences, such as the Rudin-Shapiro [20] (characterized
by continuous spectra), might be worth being explored.

However, the degree of freedom available in the choice of the scale ratio
ν = d2/d1 can be exploited in principle to control the spectral properties and
achieve, for instance, a multibeam radiation pattern. As a simple example,
we consider a nonphased (η = 0) conﬁguration with average inter-element
spacing dav < λ0.
It is readily observed from (11), (12) that, besides the
unit-amplitude QF wave (q1 = q2 = 0) (main beam at broadside), the only
other propagating QF waves (secondary beams) are

Note that, since
and (29b) will always be at least 13dB below the main beam, and thus at the
same level of sidelobes as in ﬁnite-size periodic arrays, irrespective of the scale
ratio ν. Conversely, for the secondary beam in (29), one has
π, and
thus its amplitude can be controlled over a wide range by varying the scale
ratio ν. Restricting attention to the (q1 = 0, q2 = 1) beam, one ﬁnds from
(11), (12) the corresponding direction β01 (from endﬁre) and amplitude S01
to be

(30)

The direction β01 can thus be steered, by varying dav/λ0, up to a maximum
value β(max)
51.83o, corresponding to the maximum
spacing (dav = λ0) allowable to prevent emergence, in the visible range, of
higher-order grating lobes. The amplitude S01 can be controlled (from 0 to

= arccos [τ /(1 + τ )]

1, in principle) by varying the scale ratio ν = d2/d1 (from 1 to 0). One thus
obtains a multibeam radiation pattern with the possibility of controlling the
secondary beam amplitude. Results for the (q1 = 0, q2 =
1) beam follow
from symmetry considerations. Obvious fabrication-related issues prevent ν
from being exceedingly small, but values of ν
0.25 are suﬃcient to achieve
secondary beam amplitudes
2dB. Figure 10 shows the radiation pattern
(array factor) of a 101-element array, with dav/λ0 and ν chosen from (30) so
as to create a secondary beam at 45o with various amplitudes. It is observed
that actual amplitude values are very close to the inﬁnite-array predictions
in (30), and that minor sidelobes never exceed the periodic-array sidelobe
level (-13dB).

It is hoped that the above observations might open up new perspec-
tives for reconﬁgurable arrays. Note that rational values of ν (commen-
surate scales) correspond to conﬁgurations interpretable as periodic arrays
with aperiodically-distributed lacunas. In these cases, one can think of easily-
implementable reconﬁgurable strategies, based on switching from single-beam
(periodic array) to multibeam (modiﬁed-Fibonacci) radiation patterns, via
on-oﬀ selection of a set of antenna elements, keeping the average inter-element
spacing dav < λ0.

6 Conclusions and Perspectives

A simple illustrative example of wave interaction with quasiperiodic order
has been discussed in connection with the radiation properties of 1-D an-
tenna arrays, utilizing the modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence. A “quasi-Floquet”
analytic parameterization, based on a generalized Poisson summation for-
mula, has been derived for inﬁnite and semi-inﬁnite arrays. Computational
issues and potential applications have been brieﬂy addressed.

It is hoped that the prototype study in this paper, through its instructive
insights into some of the basic mechanisms governing wave interactions with
quasiperiodic order, may lead to new applications in array radiation pattern
control, in view of the additional degrees of freedom available in aperiodic
structures. Accordingly, we are planning current and future investigations of
modiﬁed-Fibonacci arrays that will emphasize the eﬀects of the scale ratio
parameter (ν = d2/d1) on the input impedance as well as on the coupling to
possible dielectric-substrate-induced leaky modes. Exploration of the radia-
tion properties of antenna arrays based on other well-understood aperiodic

15

sequences (e.g., Thue-Morse, period-doubling, Rudin-Shapiro [20]) is also
being pursued.

Appendix
Pertaining to (10)–(13)

In [27], the modiﬁed-Fibonacci array spectrum in (10) is computed using
two equivalent approaches, one directly based on the cut-and-project scheme
described in Sec. 2.2 (see also Fig. 2), and the other based on an “average
unit cell” method [32]. Although the two approaches are relatively simple in
principle, their implementation is rather involved and not reported here for
brevity. The reader is referred to [27], [32] for theoretical foundations and
technical details, and to [40], [41] for an alternative approach applicable to
rather general substitutional sequences. We point out that in [27], the result
for the radiation spectrum is given in normalized form, with a non-explicit
multiplicative constant, and assuming zero phasing (η = 0). In the paper
here, the possible presence of phasing is accounted for via the spectral shift
k0η in (12). The calculation of the proper multiplicative constant in (10)
(and hence that in (13)) has been accomplished by ﬁrst observing that for
the modiﬁed-Fibonacci sequence in (5), the number of array elements falling
within a window of width 2ζ approaches the ratio between the window width
and the average inter-element spacing dav in (7), as ζ

Acknowledgements

For some reason the act of writting acknowledgements puts me in a contemplative
state. Me, looking at an empty page. Not because of lack of people to whom I have
to say thanks, but because I would like to ﬁnd the best words. The dilemma is that,
sometimes, these words seems weak to express oneself gratitude. Our ‘Thanks a lot’
dissolves in the everyday use. For those appearing in these lines my thanks are more
than what my poor writting is able to express.

To you, Mario, my most sincerly gratitude, respect and appreciation. Also, for all
your support and encouragement over all this time. I hope to return you some of what
I received from you.

To the Fundaci´on Antorchas. I started my postgraduate studies with its support;
now, I am also ﬁnishing with them. Since, the foundation ﬁnancined my last year in
Germany. Also, to all the people working there, whom have all my gratitude.

To Martina Z¨ahle, for all her pacience teaching me the mathematical tools used
in part of this thesis. All those encounters helped me to consolidate the original idea
displayed in the last chapters. Also, for all her eﬀort turning my stay in Jena as best
as possible.

Finally to my parents and friends.

The Turbulent Refractive Index:
Dynamics and Stochastic
Properties

The study of phenomena occurring in a turbulent ﬂuid has been successively improved
during the last 40 years. Speciﬁcally, the concentration of a substance advected by the

turbulence has received most of the attention, for it covers a wide range of natural and
engineering settings: heat transport, dye diﬀusion, microscopic organism movements,

etc.. These substances are described by scalar ﬁelds with a negligible back-eﬀect on
the ﬂow; thus, they are called passive scalar ﬁelds.

The turbulent refractive index also belongs to this class; this is not a novelty

(Tatarsk˘ı, 1961). The temperature is a passive scalar ﬁeld whenever it produces buoy-
ancy forces smaller than the inertial stresses driving the ﬂow, and a direct calculation
shows that its ﬂuctuations are proportional to those of the index.

Our interest in lightwave propagation through turbulent media must start here
then. That is, we have to comprehend the media before attempt a description of

In the forthcoming sections we will study the dynamics and
the propagation itself.
stochastic properties of passive scalars, and eventually propose models for the refractive
index.

1.1.1 The turbulent ﬂow: Kolmogorov hypotheses

Above we have, without more precisions, referred to the turbulent media. From now
on, we mean incompressible ﬂuids in turbulent state; moreover, all our discussions will

be targeting the atmosphere or experiments that resemble it. Of course, this section is
intent to explain what ‘turbulent’ is.

Let us start from the beginning; as it is well known ﬂuids are governed by the

The balance is given here between the ﬁrst term on the rightmost-hand side of this

equation, which represents the energy injected per unit time into the system, and the
energy dissipated by the viscous forces, that is, the second term.

It was Kolmogorov (1941) who ﬁrst realized that from dimensional and reliable

heuristic arguments the energy transfer could be explained. His success was to notice
that the results of this analysis become universal laws in the statistical sense. The

turbulent velocity ﬁeld should be thought a stochastic variable in the ensemble’s sense
of the statistical mechanics. It is independent on how the turbulence began: it does
not matter the way the energy is injected. That is, the statistics of the chosen force

has no eﬀect over the statistics of the turbulence.

Moreover, we will also assume that a fully developed turbulence is spatially isotropic,

homogeneous, and stationary: for any linear transformation and translation the system
looks the same.

In this section we will treat the turbulence development under the direct energy

injection. That is, the energy is injected by the largest disturbances of size L—the
integral scale—, corresponding to the size of the bath, and then it is transferred towards
the smallest scales. Finally a minimum scale l0—the inner length—is reached, there
the energy is dumped by the viscosity into heat (the magnitude of the inner length
oscilates between 10−

3m and 10−

2m).

The range of scales l where the energy transfer happens without loss, the ﬂux of

energy from scale to scale is constant, is called inertial range

l0 ≪

l

≪

L.

This process can be thought as a cascade of energy that propagates through the scales

via a succession of disturbances (eddies which are portions of ﬂuid with size l and

according to its size, from the bigger to the smallest, as follows:

with π < 1 the contraction ratio of the eddy size from one generation to the other.

Now, we can use this scheme to estimate some of the quantities involved in the
generation of the turbulence. Thus, let Vln be the volume occupied by the eddies of

the following estimation for the energy transfer rate,

If we now consider that the volume occupied by the eddies is independent of the scale,
i.e., Vl ∼

This scaling law is the fundamental result, as we shall see, of the whole chapter for it
will be underneath every property we are about to show.

For instance, let us try some examples: we have deﬁned before the inner length as

method is so successful because it allows us to override this second step.

Assume the mean ﬂow is zero and the random velocity ﬁeld has the properties we

have discussed at the beginning: homogeneity and isotropy. The existence of scaling
laws for the n-correlation functions means the existence of exponents ηn such that

Because the energy transfer per unit volume is constant all over the inertial range

and there is independence from the source of turbulence, the n-correlators of the
stochastic velocity ﬁeld will just depend from the scale. If we look back at equation

of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld, is scarce explaining the way the transference of energy
occurs between the diﬀerent scales. This the task to be tackled in the next section.

1.1.2 The energy cascade in isotropic turbulence

As before, we are dealing with an homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The energy
is then constant throughout space. Thus, when we consider the transport of turbulent

energy, this will be in wavenumber rather than in the coordinate space. So, we can
foresee a transfer from one range of eddy sizes to another: the cascade phenomenon.

We used McComb’s (1991) book as the main guide for this section.

In order to have isotropy and homogeneity we will make the boundary of our system
go to inﬁnity. We will deal here and thereafter with incompressible ﬂuids, so going back

to equation (1.1) we set
the Navier-Stokes equation, applying the divergence to both sides of it yields:

F = 0. Additionally, we can obtain another property from

There, the superﬁcial terms are zero according to the conditions imposed to the tur-

The formation of a stationary isotropic turbulence requires the external force F

to counter-eﬀect the action of the viscous force, but for the present discussion we
momentarily set it equal to zero.

This equation concentrates all the non-linear eﬀects producing the advection on its left
side, while the smoothing diﬀusive term is on the right-hand side. Also, for all the
practical problems the non-linear term here is no more complex than the original one.

Although possible, we would rather not build diﬀerential equations for the moments
of the velocity ﬁeld from equation (1.14); instead, it will be enough for us to recover

an energy balance equation. Thus, we introduce the Fourier transform of the random
velocity,

Previously we introduced the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the conﬁguration space
assuming the process is also time-stationary, but equation (1.35) does not posses that

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

the greater the wavenumber the faster the energy density will decay.

So, that is how the cascade happens: the non-linear term takes energy from the

1.1 Turbulence

13

low wavenumbers, where there is net energy production, to compensate the net losses
due to viscosity dissipation at high wavenumbers. We hope that this transfer will lead

the system at large times to a steady state. Because this situation is found in many
real ﬂows, the fully developed turbulence model is a representative class of turbulent

phenomena.

To consider a time-stationary state within this model we will introduce an artiﬁcial
term. We will restore an external random force-like term f(k, t) into the spectral

equation. It should also satisfy, remember equation (1.16),

k

f(k, t) = 0.

Now, in order to ﬁnd an explicit form for the rightmost term above we must char-

its autocorrelation is given by

While the ﬁrst equation tells us that the energy injected to the system from the
low modes are transferred by the non-linear term to the higher modes, i.e., the inertial

forces transfer energy from low to high wavenumbers. The second equation explains
that the energy transferred is dissipated in the range k∗ < k′ <

.

We have ﬁnished characterizing the stochastic properties of the turbulence; also, we
provided a model for the energy cascade. The inertial range is thus deﬁned by those
wavenumbers lesser than some k∗, where most of the advective term is concentrated.
Therefore from the dimensional arguments we have used in Section 1.1.1, we can take
3/4. We mentioned before that the injected energy W should
kd = k∗
be concentrated around k = 0; so, the limit 2π/L is the cut-oﬀ that sets the injection

of energy. This is how the inertial range (see Figure 1.1) is set within the wavenumber
space:

2π

Now, the spectral density of energy becomes independent of the viscosity in this

range as long as the Reynolds number is high. There is no other possibility for this
function than to be

E(k) = αε 2/3k−

5/3,

with α an adimensional constant. But, of course, this is the case of ν
0 which is an
idealization. If we introduce the dissipation via kd the distribution should be written,

The theoretical form for F is still under discussion. Moreover, there are strong
clues that suggest that this functional relation extends all over the inertial range. It

Figure 1.1: Energy balance: three intervals are marked: below 2π/L (in blue) the
energy is injected by the external forces, above k∗ (in red) the energy is dissipated
by viscous forces, and ﬁnally the inertial range comes from the balance between the
energy injection and dissipation—as it is shown in equation (1.42).

1.1.3 The problem of the intermittency: Kolmogorov reﬁned

hypotheses

The phenomenon of intermittent turbulence was ﬁrst experimentally noticed by Batch-

elor and Townsend (1949). They found that the energy was nonuniformly distributed
throughout space in a fully developed turbulence. Some regions showed to be more
active than others. The energy intermittence also implies that the dissipation behaves

in the same way: this contradicts the assumptions that lead to equation (1.7). That
is, the volume Vl occupied by eddies of size l is not constant, as we supposed after
(1.6). Therefore, the global average should be replaced by local averages of the energy
dissipation rate, for the former does not represent the behavior of ε.

citetpaper:oboukhov was the ﬁrst to tackle this problem. His proposal was to divide
the spatial domain into a collection of ensembles with characteristic dissipation εr—
where εr is the locally averaged dissipation over a spherical volume with diameter r
and center r′. Later Kolmogorov (1962) used this proposal to rebuild his hypotheses.
He added another hypothesis to shape the randomness of the energy dissipation rate:

1.1 Turbulence

εr(r′, t) is a Gaussian variable having as variance of log εr the following

σ2
r (r′, t) = A(r′, t) + 9µ log

u(r′), Kn is an adimensional constant, and ε is, as before, the

energy dissipation rate averaged over the entire bath of characteristic size L. Never-
theless, it is found that the universal constant µ depends on the order n. This is known

−

as scale-similar theory of intermittency. It is worth nothing that it is unnecessary the
log-normality to explain (1.49).

To get a picture of how intermittence is created from the continous process of

stretching and twisting of the advective term we will follow Frisch et al. (1978). Let us
restart from equation (1.5), assume that the average number of oﬀspring of any eddy
is N—an eddy of scale ln is supposed to give rise to N eddies of scale ln+1, irrespective
of the value of n. These N eddies occupy a fraction β of their predecessor . This
fractional reduction in volume from one generation to the next is given by

With the arguments we have given, the accumulated energy from the eddies of size n

through the diﬀerent eddies scales is not valid (Frisch and Parisi, 1983).

h

To override this problem let us suppose that instead a single scale h there is a
range of them hmin ≤
hmax where (1.56) happens. Thus, we have a wider set
[hmin,hmax]Sh. Each subset has its own fractal dimension Dh. To
of singularities,

calculate the moments of the velocity variation ∆ur at a point r′ we have to look for
the probability of ﬁnding such variation in one of the subsets Sh. This probability is
proportional to the volume of Sh thickened along the normal direction by a length r.

Besides the latter model, other alternatives to the β-model using fractal geometry

has been proposed (Benzi et al., 1984) to explain the energy transfer: the random
β-model. It is assumed that the eddy splitting is not constant; from one generation

to the other N changes. That is, the contraction factors β are independent random
variables.

These fractal models gives a better understanding of the phenomenon of advection

and intermittence. But neither of them predict the values the anomalous dimension,
and it must be found by experimental means.

1.2 Passive Scalar Fields’ Characterization

1.2.1 Scalar turbulence

The turbulent ﬂow transports and disperses any scalar by making parcels of ﬂuid
follow chaotic trajectories: the non-uniformity of the turbulence causes lines of constant

scalar stretch and fold. This process drives the scalar concentration through smaller
scales; eventually, the diﬀusivity κ associated to the scalar (e.g. thermal diﬀusivity,
molecular diﬀusivity, etc.) prevails over the advective mixing. There are so many

parallels between this behavior and the one of velocity ﬁeld that we address it as scalar
turbulence (Shraiman and Siggia, 2000).

In a turbulent ﬂow the scalar is controlled by two processes: transport, the physical
translocation of the scalar via the combined action of ﬂuid advection and diﬀusion;
and mixing, the irreversible decay of ﬂuctuations because of the scalar diﬀusion, κ,

that tends to reduce the scalar ﬁeld to uniformity. In a turbulent ﬂow, both processes
become independent of κ as it goes to zero. This limit is the so called fully developed
scalar turbulence.

Any given scalar (concentration of the) quantity Θ put into a static ﬂuid is subject

to a diﬀusion equation, that is,

∂
∂t

Θ(r, t) = κ

Θ(r, t).

The extension to ﬂowing ﬂuids is accomplished replacing the partial time derivative by

with v the random velocity ﬁeld which is naturally solenoidal, i. e.,

v = 0.

Now, the above equation is our starting point. One should consider introduce the

Navier-Stokes equation to describe the velocity ﬁeld, but we will not do so. In fact, most
of the actual developments in scalar turbulence does not need a deep understanding
of the velocity ﬁeld: for all the purposes here will be enough to describe it as a given

(1.72)

The idea that all the properties encountered studying the turbulent velocity can be

mapped to the scalar turbulence was also employed to build an inertial convective (time-
stationary) spectrum for the scalar variance. Oboukhov (1949) and, independently,
Corrsin (1951) settled down the ﬁrst steps towards a scaling law for scalar ﬁelds. Using

the analogy between the scalar diﬀusion coeﬃcient κ and the viscosity coeﬃcient they
both used dimensional arguments to ﬁnd an extra cut-oﬀ for the energy spectrum:

kc = ε1/4κ−

3/4.

(1.73)

Because we now have two ultraviolet cut-oﬀs, kc and kd, the inertial convective
range should be that where both the viscosity and the diﬀusion coeﬃcients go to zero,
i.e., 2π/L
. Afterwards, within this range the power spectrum for

Unlike the velocity ﬁeld, there is an innate term

injecting energy down to the
small scales, and it can not be discarded at will. It causes one of the characteristic
features of the scalar turbulence: the observation of ramp-and-cliﬀ structures regardless

the model introduced for the velocity ﬁeld. This is the source of scalar intermittence
and anisotropy seen in experiments and numerical simulations. On the contrary, the

Kolmogorov-Oboukhov-Corrsin (KOC) theory assumes that the advective term restores
universality, i.e., independence of large-scale injection mechanisms, and thus isotropy
at the inertial-convective range. This is far from our ﬁnal goal, which describes the

full behavior of the scalars. But before inspect the anomalous scaling inherent to
intermittence, we will introduce an isotropic model binding the scalar ﬁelds to the

velocity scaling behavior.

1.2 Passive Scalar Fields’ Characterization

1.2.2 Kraichnan’s model

The Kraichnan’s model (1968) for passive advection assumes that both velocity and
scalar ﬁelds are homogeneous and isotropic. So, we must introduce an external force
f —proportional to the diﬀusion κ—in order to compensate the energy dissipation.

This model for the stochastic velocity ﬁeld is far from realistic. Besides the fact

that it mimics the spatial dependence of the correlation function, the opposite happens
with the time. The velocities are white noise in time: they are uncorrelated everywhere
but t = t′. Hence, at any instant all the moments of the velocities are inﬁnite! There is
independence from the past, which contradicts the KOC model where the time-to-live

Therefore, homogeneous and isotropic scalar turbulence imposes a universal law for

the correlation function, since it only depends on the mean dissipation rate and the
distance.

1.2.3 Anomalous scaling, anisotropy and diﬀusion

We surveyed with the Kraichnan’s model the behavior of the isotropic and homogeneous
scalar turbulence. We note that intermittence in the velocity ﬁeld is directly translated
to the scalar ﬁeld, equation (1.87). The anomalous scaling in scalar turbulence is just

the separation from this inherited power spectra.

In the present context universality of scalar ﬁelds should be understood as the

Πnϑ(rn, tn)
in a stationary regime when
existence of limiting correlation functions
κ, m, 1/L
0—as deﬁned in the former section—are independent of the external
force, i.e., the shape of the correlation function C. This condition let us build the

with D as in (1.77).

Gaw¸edzki and Kupiainen (1995) determined that the correlators become indepen-

dent of the diﬀusion and infrared cut-oﬀ, but there exits a dependence upon the external
force. The integral scale L contributes to the n-point structure functions

L as κ, m go to zero. The amplitudes γ2n depend on ζ and the function
for
C, while the exponents ρ2n are just functions of ζ but not C. While for n = 1 the
intermittence is absent, ρ2 = 0, for n > 1 the ρ’s are positive, increasing, and convex
function of n.

They followed the arguments from Kraichnan (1994) who noticed that an exact
expression can be written for advection eﬀects on scalar structure functions when ve-

locity ﬁelds change rapidly in time, they are delta correlated. The second assumption
is the need for the scalar ﬁeld ϑ to be Gaussian, because it makes possible to break
down the closure problem, that is, the dependence on higher moments of the scalar.

and has a long scaling range 0 < ζ2(u) < 2—in the sense of (1.58)—it acts like a rapidly
changing ﬁeld because the large scales sweep ﬂuid elements rapidly through the small
scales. So we should have ζ(η) = ζ2(u) + 1, but it does not hold for any pair of values
ζ(η), ζ2(u). As can be seen from the ranges covered by each power; moreover, it seems
valid near the classical values: ζ(η) = 4/3 and ζ2(u) = 1/3. In any case we can aﬃrm
that there is not exist an invective relation between both variables.

Up to now, we have seen that the eﬀect of the external source can not be separated

from the phenomenon of intermittence. Besides, scalar turbulence is generated from
the existence of a mean ﬁeld of the scalar. So the prescription of an isotropic external
source must be abandoned: the scalar ﬂuctuations are excited by entwining of the mean

external gradient of the passive scalar by turbulent ﬂow.

Therefore, given the external gradient

The transference of the scalar concentration is done through the wavenumber space.
So, let us consider the spectrum of the anisotropic scalar in the wavenumber interval
2π/L < k < min
. Because the molecular diﬀusivity is supposed to go to
{

inﬁnity, the two relevant terms are the advection and mean scalar gradient in the
above equation. Both must be of the same order.

Besides, the eddy diﬀusivity, as we brieﬂy introduce it before, measures the rate
of transport of scalar concentration from one portion of ﬂuid to another. It was ﬁrst
introduced by Heisenberg (1948) (see McComb, 1991, p. 75) and as a function of the

We are seeing two processes in this discussion: the largest eddies grabbing energy
from the anisotropic mean ﬁeld, they signiﬁcantly contribute to the structure function
below certain scale 1/k
; above this characteristic length the external forces turns

isotropic introducing the suitable power spectra.

These anomalous exponents sensibly modify the probability distribution of the

scalar ﬁelds. That is, they deviate from the Gaussian shape adding (exponential) tails.
But because in this work we are just interested in the second moments the Gaussian
approximation is enough.

Among all the passive scalars ﬁelds, the kind represented by the temperature re-
quires more attention. Usually its turbulent state is reached through convection, but

because temperature diﬀerences are the trigger for turbulent mixing the temperature
ﬁeld should not, at ﬁrst, be passive. Whether the temperature is active or passive de-
pends on the magnitude of the contribution from buoyancy forces to the total energy.

1.3 The Turbulent Index of Refraction

It is despicable when the Rayleigh number is small:

αg∆T L3

Ra =

νκ ≪

(1.97)

where α is the volume expansion coeﬃcient, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and ∆T
is the temperature diﬀerence between bottom and top of the bath of size L. Meaning it
does not aﬀect the state of turbulence. It happens when this number becomes relevant

that scaling and gaussianity of the temperature ﬁeld are observed (Sano et al., 1989;
Ra < 107). But
Gollub et al., 1991; Ching, 2000) (for the soft convective turbulence
the scaling exponent behavior is more complex than in the scalar turbulence problem,
and most of the arguments presented here are not applicable.

1.3 The Turbulent Index of Refraction

We are going to ﬁnish this chapter describing the behavior of the refractive index inside
a turbulent ﬂow. It has been proven long ago (Bean and Dutton, 1968) that

propagation it is assumed that the humidity term is negligible, hence

That is, deviations from the mean temperature ﬁeld are proportional to those of the
refractive index. Adiabatic corrections must be introduced to this formula when the

system is the whole atmosphere (see Ishimaru, 1997, p. 523), but they do not break

1.3 The Turbulent Index of Refraction

34

the linear relation. Therefore, the deviations from the mean ﬁelds are proportional,
and the refractive index inherits the passive scalar properties from the temperature

ﬁeld proved it is a scalar ﬁeld.

As we introduced a synthetic turbulent velocity ﬁeld to make insight into the be-

havior of the scalar turbulence. We will do the same for the lightwave propagation in
turbulent media. That is, we will introduce a model for the refractive index such that
most of the properties described in the former sections are present in it.

Our assignment is to associate to the turbulent index of refraction a suited stochastic
process. We have seen that the anomalies in the exponents of the n-point correlation
functions drives the scalar ﬁelds apart from the Gaussian statistics at ﬁrst. Never-

theless, all the theoretical models presented here induce a Gaussian behavior for the
scalars because the stochastic velocity ﬁeld is Gaussian. Moreover, because in this work

we will only be interested in the ﬁrst moments of the propagated light, the Gaussian
distribution is enough.

The family of Gaussian processes is wide, and each member of it is deﬁned, as

we shall see in the next section, by its 2-point correlation function or covariance.
Because we are specially interested in the properties of the atmospheric propagation, a

fully developed turbulence, the covariance deﬁned within the inertial range characterize
almost all its properties. Although until now we have not explicitly given an expression
for this covariance, we will show that the structure function is suﬃcient.

When the velocity ﬁeld is homogeneous and isotropic, and the external source is
isotropic the structure function for the stochastic refractive index, according to (1.90),

should have the form:

µ is the stochastic component of the turbulent refractive index n, the constant A2 is
known as structure constant 3, and 0 < ζ < 2 . Even the limit ζ
2 must be taken in
consideration because of the anisotropic behavior of the passive scalars

→

The structure function is in fact the covariance of the increments. The translation
invariance of equation (1.99) implies that these increments are stationary in the statis-
ε when ζ = 2/3. Its range is around 10−14–10−11m−2/3 for low altitude

3Usually is noted as C2

measures and 10−18–10−16m−2/3 for the high altitude (Tatarsk˘ı, 1961; Ishimaru, 1997).

1.3 The Turbulent Index of Refraction

35

tical sense. That is, the probability distribution remains the same under translations.
On the other hand, previous works make diﬀerent prescriptions for the turbulent

index from the ones we have given. They assume the process should be stationary and
give other covariance functions in consequence, for example: the exponential correlation

function,

that makes the process markovian in the propagation direction z, ﬁrst suggested4 by
Klyatskin and Tatarsk˘ı (1970) and later mathematically formalized by Leland (1989).

But we have seen the stationary property for the stochastic refractive index is
unnecessary; moreover, the 2-point correlation function (1.99) only demands stationary
increments. Our proposal will be to use the fractional Brownian motion as a model

for passive scalar ﬁelds (P´erez and Garavaglia, 2001).

1.3.1 The synthetic refractive index: the fractional Brownian

motion

Finally, in this section we will construct the synthetic index we are going to employ
studying lightwave propagation. For such a task the refractive index must follow most of

the properties described above. From all the possible Gaussian processes, the fractional
Brownian motions seem the best suited to accomplish this as they present the following

and so the increments are locally stationary.

Now, the departure µ from the mean index of refraction n0 is a small quantity.
That is why the stochastic index also measures the behavior of the permitivity, i.e.,
n2
ε(r)
0 + 2µ(r). It is a convention among the literature to substitute the turbulent
index by the stochastic permitivity ǫ(r) = 2µ(r), and so we will do here. If we write

≃

the exponent in equation (1.99) as ζ = 2H, from the former property (1.104) under
the conditions given, thus we deﬁne

ǫ(r) := α ˜BH(r/l)

(1.105)

with α an adimensional constant and l some characteristic scale. When we consider

a fully developed turbulence, isotropic and homogeneous, the Kolmogorov hypotheses
sets H = 1/3. We are considering departures from this ideal situation so 1/3
H < 1
will be our working range.

Let us compare the structure function of the permitivity against the structure
function generated by this synthetic permitivity. Thus using equations (1.99), (1.104)

the coeﬃcient α = 2 lH√A2. Therefore, we must determine the characteristic length

Although, the relation between these two is linear, and thus does not coincide with

This expression exactly matches the one calculated by Constantin et al. (1991). Since,
it replicates the equation (1.93) with ζ1 = H as we proved above.

We have shown here that the isotropic fBm not only provides stationary increments

and reproduces the structure function for the stochastic refractive index but also gives
the right fractal dimension associated to the passive scalars. Moreover, the structure
function (1.99) gives a covariance function v which corresponds to a non-diﬀerentiable

process. A simple calculation

The Cram´er and Leadbetter’s Lemma (1967) proves the refractive index is non-dif-
ferentiable. This is the same with the isotropic fractional Brownian motion as it is

proved in the Appendix A.

Therefore, these reasons are enough to use this model as source in the Optics’

diﬀerential equations. In particular, we will use plenty of it in the last chapter.

Chapter 2

Classical Methods Applied to
Turbulent Lightwave Propagation

The problem of light passing through a hollow made on a surface is explained in
every Optics treatise. In this chapter we are going to make a brief introduction to it;

afterwards, we will show how it is related to the Feynman’s Path Integrals formalism.
It is this technique which had proven fundamental studying image formation in the
case of light propagating through a turbulent medium. Further ahead we will describe

such a problem, and eventually use it to study some characteristic properties of the
refractive index.

2.1 From the Green’s Theorem to the Feynman’s

Path Integral

mathematically described as follows;

Figure 2.1: The surface where the boundary condition u is set is represented by its
normal vector σ. It is contained in the (x, y)-plane, while the z-axis is the direction of
propagation.

where G is the Green’s solution to the wave equation (2.1), u is the boundary condition

given by the hollowed surface (Figure 2.1). Therefore, the solution to the Kirchhoﬀ-
Huygens equation is written in this context as

plane wave factor—so we will drop it oﬀ the paraxial approximation. Besides, setting

2.2 Image Formation using the Feynman’s Path In-

tegral Representation

In the following we are going to change the representation space we are actually using

by another called velocity representation space. This representation was introduced
and used frequently by Russian scientists—it is just a functional change of variables.
It has proven extremely useful in handling propagation problems (Klyatskin, 1970,

1975). Now, let us introduce it:

Also, this new variable requires its own normalization, that is,

Green function to introduce the procedure we will afterwards follow in more complex
situations. As always, we start dividing the interval [0, L] in N new subintervals, but
this time we will also introduce the following Fourier transform,

So it is appropriate to write the Green function as:

G(R, L; R0, 0) = g(R0, R, L) G0(R, L; R0, 0),

(2.30)

therefore, we have concentrated all the random features of the medium within this last

function—it is set equal to 1 when perturbations are absent.

Before going further, we have to describe the environment in Optics where ap-
proximation (2.15) holds. As in Section 1.3.1, we write the permitivity as a constant

term—we will assume equal to one—plus another term ǫ containing all the information
coming from the medium. There, we consider the propagation of quasi-monochromatic

lightwave radiation with frequency ω, that is,

+ [1 + ǫ(r, z)]k2

(r, z) = 0,

△

E

(cid:8)

(cid:9)
(r, z) is the scalar electromagnetic ﬁeld—there is no polarization here. Suppos-
where
ing that backscattering is negligible, and thus the propagation has a preferred direction,
let us say

ωt), the latter equation changes to

(r, z) = E(r, z) ei(kz

E

−

E

+ k2ǫ(r, z)

E(r, z) = 0.

(2.32)

△
(cid:2)
Hence, under the condition kz
1 we retrieve equation (2.15). Thereafter this is
a stochastic parabolic equation, and it can be solved when ǫ is a markovian1 process
along the propagation axis as it was shown by Rytov et al. (1989). Moreover, its

≫

(cid:3)

solution coincides with the deterministic solution we have just shown. Charnotsk˘ı
(1991) extensively discusses the applications of the path integral formulation to this
problem. In the Appendix B we summarize how he characterizes the cohabitation of two

regimes: weak and strong. Basically the technical diﬀerences between both regimes are

1See Chapter 3 for a detailed description.

2.2 Image Formation using the Feynman’s Path Integral Representation 56

the following. The weak regime cumulates a variety of methods grouped under the tag
of Rytov’s formalism—whose central idea is to solve equation (2.32), or an equivalent

form, using a Taylor -like series expansion—in practical terms this distinction provides
a way to select the best method for solving a particular problem. While the strong

regime has, until now, one tool: the path-integral approach. Nevertheless, it is this
approach the only one covering both regimes.

Finally, let us build the irradiance distribution from the solution to the inhomo-

geneous wave equation (2.32). According to deﬁnition (2.30) and equation (2.26) we
have:

E(R, L) =

d2R0 E(R0, 0) G(R, L; R0, 0)

=

d2R0 E(R0, 0) G0(R, L; R0, 0) g(R0, R, L),

and so the intensity function is

I(R, L) = E∗(R, L)E(R, L)

=

d2R′0 d2R0 E∗(R′0, 0)E(R0, 0) G∗(R, L; R′0, 0) G(R, L; R0, 0). (2.33)

Now suppose the coherence time ω−

furthermore, it can be assumed ergodic. So, if the source is spatially incoherent, the

E∗(R′0, 0)E(R0, 0) = A(R0) δ(2)(R′0 −

Nevertheless, for the current discussion we will keep the distribution function A, and

self-image system.

In the next section we will apply these results to the case of image formation in

2.3 Intensity Distribution of Self-image Systems into

Turbulent Media

Here we will describe light propagation through a Lau-like arrangement, that is, two

Ronchi grids out of phase half a period within a turbulent medium. Also, we will
inspect how degradation produced by the turbulence can be estimated in terms of the
spacing between two parallel grids, the number of lines per millimeter, and C 2
ǫ , the
structure constant of the medium (P´erez and Garavaglia, 1999).

Now, we introduce the optical system for the present discussion: as it is sketched

in Figure 2.3, it consists of a Lau system of grids—we have no lens here—separated by
a distance L and half a period out of phase. That is, each grid can be thought as the
negative image of the other. Finally, between the grids there is a turbulent medium
with structure constant C 2
ε , roughly homogeneous in the plane perpendicular to the z
direction. At z = l there is a screen where we want to observe the system behavior.

We suppose that the medium between the second grid and the screen plane is free from
turbulence.

In this problem there are only two optical elements: the grids. Both of them have

the same tramittance function, it can be modeled as a family of square wave functions

problem: the light passing through the ﬁrst grid coming from a spatial incoherent source

A0 is the maximum value for the irradiance distribution and D is the size of the
rectangular grid; while the tramittance A2 of the second grid is modeled using the
same functional relationship, but with A0 = 1 and setting the phase α = d.

The irradiance function I(R), as we showed arriving to equation (2.36), can be

expressed as follows:

Finally, the Fourier transform of the irradiance distribution (2.46) is obtained multi-
plying the tramittance and complex correlation transforms. Nevertheless, we should be

cautious. The approximation we suggested induce the constant terms to produce more
delta functions than the Fourier integral is able to handle. Therefore, we will redeﬁne
those problematic terms. Let us start with y-axis, because all tramittance functions

depends on the x-axis we can write,

We observe from above that eliminating the eﬀects from the edges corresponds to the

condition

D/2 < Ry < D/2, there we have the constant intensity distribution:

makes this exponential real. On the other hand, it also makes the series in m from the

Figure 2.4: When L = (2s)l is satisﬁed we obtain non-constant irradiance patterns: a)
The condition L = (2p + 1)d2/λ gives an almost triangular irradiance. b) A triangular
shape is found whenever L = (2p)2d2/λ and l = (2q)2d2/λ, but the shape has less
contrast—it is 1/16 of the latter. c) The triangular shaped and parabolic teethed
functions contribute to a) but just the former to b). The parabolic teethed function
weights considerably less than the triangular so its contribution is almost negligible.

Therefore, it only depends on the quotient between L and l. The nearer the screen to
the last grid the higher is the value of the visibility.

2.3.2 The turbulent case

The statistical averages we will use here are understood as long exposure time-averages
(Roddier, 1981). Furthermore, the only relevant assumptions about the permitivity ǫ

is being Gaussian process and markovian on the z-axis (Tatarsk˘ı and Zavorotny, 1980).

smoothing the original irradiance pattern. The integer N
good measure of this cutoﬀ—terms beyond that number add corrections of order less

between the patterns generated by infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths for the same

geometric arrangement.

Afterwards, we can estimate the visibility. The visibility in the turbulent case is
smaller than in the non-turbulent one because of the cutoﬀ, and it turns smaller as the
wavelength decreases: for L = (2p + 1)d2/λ,

= 0.69742,

V

V1.2µm = 0.67865,

and

V400nm = 0.63036;

Figure 2.5: The ﬁgure compares the irradiance patterns for two very diﬀerent wave-
lengths, 400nm (soft-ultraviolet) and 1.2µm (red), given a ﬁxed geometric conﬁgura-

Amazingly, it is the second irradiance distribution pattern (2.84), which has a ﬂattened
pattern, more sensitive to changes in the wavelength and turbulence behavior against
what their patterns suggest.

The cutoﬀ also depends on the geometry of the system. Two instances are relevant;

in the non-turbulent case—equations (2.73) and (2.74). These results show us how
the geometry inﬂuences image formation in a turbulent media. The behavior of the
visibility is in agreement with the results of Zavorotny (1988) for an inﬁnitely extended

source as it vanishes when d goes to inﬁnity. Moreover, if d is small enough the eﬀects
of the turbulent medium vanish and the visibility recovers the value it takes in the

absence of turbulence.

Finally, here we have established the conditions for image formation in a Lau-like

Figure 2.6: The ﬁrst graphic displays the irradiance patterns for a λ = 400nm wave-
length and the second for λ = 1.2µm. The degradation is clearly observed in the ﬁrst
example, but hardly can be seen in the red wave length.

arrangement. For a visibility diﬀerent from zero, the separation between grids, L, and
the distance from the last of them to the screen, l, are related by the condition (2.57).
We observe the appearance of a characteristic length d2/λ, it is called Talbot distance
and is widely present in grids systems. Only on integer multipliers of it we have found

a non-zero visibility. In these situations we were able to express the degradation in
terms of a few variables: the physical C 2

ǫ and λ, and the geometrical L and d.

Also, the mean irradiance is exact: either it is useful in both strong and weak

regimes. Equations like (2.83) and (2.84) provide us with a new way to calculate the
structure constant of the medium at laboratory from a density section of an image.
Indoor experiments carried out with laser beams through turbulent medium (Consortini

et al., 1990, 1996) are based in measures of their wander and thus an statistical analysis.
While ours just needs an interpolating Fourier polynomial.

We have given an introduction to the classical methods in turbulent propagation
based on a markovian model. In the forthcoming chapters we will introduce processes
with memories to accurately resemble the model we introduced in the ﬁrst chapter.

Chapter 3

Stochastic Calculus

We have shown that deﬁned the turbulent refractive index as a member of the family
of fractional Brownian motions it is not diﬀerentiable. Furthermore, we usually ﬁnd in

Optics derivatives of the refractive index within diﬀerential equations, but when the
media is turbulent these equations are undeﬁned in terms of the Classical Calculus.

For instance, let us suppose it is possible to deﬁne the derivative of a fractional or
˙BH . Thus, the integral equation associated to

standard Brownian motion, the noise:

Nevertheless, conditions over the argument function x(t) for the existence of this

type of integrals are now well established, and a Stochastic Calculus can be build from
it. This calculus and how it can be used to solve stochastic diﬀerential equations will

be described next.

3.1 Introduction: White Noise and Brownian Mo-

tion

In this section we will present the stochastic analysis for the standard Brownian motion,
and set the notions that will be later extended to the more general fractional Brownian
case.

The theory of distributions had provided us with derivatives for functions without
them in the classical sense. Therefore, it is natural to propose the white noise as a

distribution, but to do so we must also give the right abstract probability space. It
was Hida (1980) who ﬁrst used this idea as the building block for a stochastic analysis.
Here we are going to build such a space and show how it allows deﬁne integrals in the

sense of (3.1).

S

Let

(Rd) be the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth (C ∞(Rd)) real
∗(Rd)—the space of tempered
= ω(φ) the action

valued functions on Rd, and let us choose its dual
distributions—as the probability space Ω. We represent with
of the elements of the dual, ω

∗(Rd), on the functions belonging to

(Rd).

Of course, to properly deﬁne the probability space we have to attach a σ-algebra
and a probability measure. The former is straightforward, we just use the family of
(Rd)), and associated to this algebra we need to prove the existence of
Borel subsets
a measure. The Bochner-Minlos theorem (for a proof see Holden et al., 1996, Appendix
A) shows that such a measure, µ, exists; moreover, it has the following property: for

It is evident from deﬁnition (3.6) that this process is almost surely zero at x = 0.

three concepts are very important, for they provide a set of analytic tools—Itˆo formula
included—that will allow us to solve stochastic diﬀerential equations.

pansion for the 1-dimensional (1-parameter) Brownian motion deﬁned in the preceding
section. The expansion of the step function χ[0,t], using the Hermite functions, is:

3.3 Stochastic Calculus for fractional Brownian mo-

tions

In the past years diﬀerent approaches have been given to produce a Stochastic Calculus
for fractional Brownian motions: Z¨ahle (1993,2001), Decreusefond and ¨Ust¨unel (1998),
and F¨ollmer et al. (1995). Basically, these approaches tackle the problem of construct-
ing a calculus, but from two diﬀerent starting points: one uses a pathwise deﬁnition
of the integral while the other rests on the Malliavin Calculus as we sketched earlier

in this chapter. In all these circumstances the processes have are persistent. We will
follow Hu and Øksendal (1999) and Duncan et al. (2000) into the second approach.

We will construct a Stochastic Analysis from a Chaos expansion.

Stochastic Geometric Optics

Diverse experimental techniques have been devoted to the study of the optical prop-
erties of the turbulent atmosphere. Plenty of them are based on the analysis of the

output of laser beams making their way through it. But also, controlled experiences
had been developed for the laboratory, such as the experiments performed by Con-
sortini and O’Donnell (1991, 1993); Consortini et al. (1997). These experiences apply

Geometric Optics to interpret the data acquired.

All these studies have their theoretical grounds on the precursor paper by Beckman

(1965), who was able to ﬁnd a nice relationship between the variance of the turbulent
refractive index µ(r)—being homogeneous and isotropic—and the variance of the laser
beam wandering over a screen. As it was pointed out in Chapter 1, he proposes (1.100)

as covariance function because it gives meaning to the derivatives of the refractive
index. Moreover, he pointed out that the Kolmogorov-like structure functions “. . . are
mathematically fairly unmanageable”. The literature after him forgot this warning:

modiﬁcations to his solution were given (e.g., Consortini and O’Donnell, 1991) but for
the wrong covariance, the Kolmogorov structure function.

We do intent to show here, armed with our refractive index’s model, that the ray-
path equations are manageable. But this requires the Stochastic Calculus we have
introduced in the last chapter.

Before start working in our approach we will brieﬂy describe the diﬀerences between
it and other works. In most of them the markovian model plays a central role. Le-

land (1989) exaustively depicted by it. The markovian model provides the following
covariance:

E[ ǫ(ρ; z)ǫ(ρ′; z′)] = δ(z

z′)A(ρ

(4.1)

where A is a diﬀerentiable function as deﬁned in Appendix B. This covariance is asso-
ciated to a process build from the Brownian motions’ distribution space to a bounded
; that is, ǫ = L( ˙B1/2). Since this opera-
linear operator L on some Hilbert space
H
tor can be described by using some kernel function whose coeﬁcients are diﬀerentiable

functions in ρ. Obviously, this model transfers all the discontinuities to the z-axis.

For instance, let us illustrate the problem with the simple example: choose L( ˙B1/2) =

z

0 F (ρ; s) ˙B1/2(s) ds. Assuming F is continuously diﬀerentiable in ρ, the following



Therefore, not only this model does not match the covariance function but also
does not provide the right dimension for the refractive index. It eﬀectively allows some

degree of diﬀerentiability but at the cost of eliminating some physical informatin from
the refractive index covariance. Moreover, this markovian approach is not isotropic,

and an isotropic version will inexorably lead to a non-diﬀerentiable process.

In particular, we may cite the work of Consortini and O’Donnell (1991). They
follow Beckman’s steps to evaluate the covariance of the displacements of a ray over a

screen. Ending up with an equation of the form

Figure 4.1: The graphic shows the behavior of the log of the variance against the
distance L. Interpolating lines can be calculated and the values of their tangents are
shown.

where A is some constant. Afterwards, the authors commutate the derivatives with the
average. But they do not mention the markovian approximation as the cause of this,

and soon after they replace the covariance function by the isotropic one. This violates
the valid use of the commutation property (4.3); since an isotropic process does not

provide derivatives, the above equation has a priori no meaning thus it is not true we
can commute operators.

Moreover, we observe the markovian model is dependence on the characteristic

1
lenght L as L1/2, then the former integral behaves as L2
2 . The covariance of the
displacements will grow proportional to L3. This is a quality of the Brownian or
markovian processes.

Finally, we observe in Figure 4.1 several plots of the logarithm of displacement
covariance against the distance, based in the experimental data found in the work of

Consortini et al. (1997). In all cases the estimated power is below the theoretically

4.2 Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations in Geometric Optics

117

estimated. Just in the higher cases the error is wide enough to cover the calculated
value α = 3 and its value near it.

Next, we will use the isotropic fractional Brownian model within the Geometric
Optics to obtain an equation for the rays. We will show that under the correct frame-

work a solvable stochastic equation exists and its result can be directly applied to the
problem of a ray wandering over a screen.

Optics

4.2.1 The ray-path equations

As it is well-known, the Fermat’s Extremal Principle is in the foundations of the Geo-

metric Optics, that is, to ﬁnd the ray trajectories we must ﬁnd the variational solution
to

(cid:19)

(4.5)

We shall denote this solution by q(τ ), and τ is a parameter with, in principle, no
physical meaning. In Optics Treatises this parameter is usually replaced with one of
the trajectory coordinates, which fulﬁlls dqi/dτ > 0, and is thus called the propagation
direction. But the election of this parameter can not be done at will (Synge, 1937),

since, for any parameterization chosen, the Optical Lagrangian

The degeneracy of the Lagrangian should be worked out in the Hamiltonian frame-
work because of the constraint we have just found. This problem of constrained Hamil-
tonians is known as Dirac’s problem in the literature. The procedure is to reduce it to

a Lagrangian problem: because given a set of constraint functions

associated to a Lagrangian L, there is a solution q : [a, b]

4.2.2 Linearizing the trajectory equations

The ray equations we have just found are evidently nonlinear, so in this section we are
going to linearize them. But ﬁrst, we must deﬁne the parameter τ and the refractive
index. Let n be the refractive index of the medium and n0 its average, as it was deﬁned
in Section 1.3.1, we write

n2(q) = n2

0 + α ǫ∗(q),

(4.18)

we changed the stochastic permitivity ǫ(q) by α ǫ∗, where
1, so the strength
of perturbation is due to α. This term contains all the inhomogeneities of the media,
thus when α = 0 the index is constant. Now, we suppose the solution to (4.15) can be

(ǫ∗)

O

∼

expressed as power series on α, i.e.,

q(τ ) = q0 +

αnqn(τ ).

(4.19)

∞

n=1
X

Also, we should develop a series for the constraint function λ.
Instead of using an
undetermined constraint we will set its value beforehand: from all the possible param-

eterizations we choose the arc-length (4.17). Now, we can rewrite equation (4.15) as
follows

in short we will write λ2

Now, we must insert both power series in α, the expansion (4.19) and the latter
for λ2, into (4.20). We will obtain afterwards a family of diﬀerential equations from
claiming the equality between the coeﬃcients on the right and left for the same power.

it implies that b = 0; also, using the constraint condition (4.24) we obtain

2 = 1, so
we are free to choose the coordinate frame best suited to our purposes. Let us choose:

a
k

k

zˇez := q0 = τ ˇez,

(4.28)

this will be our forward direction of propagation. Now, we proceed to calculate the
next diﬀerential equation: the ﬁrst-order constraint condition (4.25) reads then

dqz
1
dz

= 0.

This and the initial condition (4.27) make the component along the z-axis null all
over the ray trajectory. Of course, this constraint is compatible with its corresponding
dynamical equation (4.22). Therefore, at ﬁrst-order in α we just have a diﬀerential

equation for the perpendicular (to the direction of propagation) displacements:

beam it will be enough to consider this ﬁrst-order equation.

With the tools we have used until now further analysis can not be done: the proper-

ties of the turbulent refractive index must be introduced in order to completely linearize
the former equation.

4.3 The Stochastic Volterra Equation

As we already know, the gradient in equation (4.30) should be given when looking for
a solution; thus, we must provide a context to understand the previous equation. That

is, a stochastic equation is not only determined by the type of process (the fractional
Brownian motion in our case) attached to it, but also by the integro-diﬀerential theory
employed in deﬁning its derivatives. Moreover, there are distinctive stochastic integra-

tion methods whether H > 1/2 or H
1/2 (Decreusefond, 2000). Here we are going
to make use of the stochastic calculus exposed in the last chapter, so only the H > 1/2

≤

case will be considered. By doing so, either we are considering the inertial-diﬀusive
range, in the following sense

ζn >

1
3

,

or the anisotropic scalar situation ζn →
1 (Elperin et al., 1996). The physical interest
about this particular situation comes from the many optical experiments where as-
pects regarding the creation of turbulence are neglected. Usually, heaters are used to

create a turbulent medium but neither buoyancy or the temperature distribution are
measured nor controlled, opposed to the conditions we have given through this work.

Furthermore, the isotropic state of the index can be questioned.

Afterwards, because the turbulent refractive index oscillates around its mean value,
it is expected that the light wanders around the z-axis over the screen (which corre-

sponds to the case α = 0). So, the solution we are looking for should also have
expectation zero. This is easily achieved by the formalism we introduced: the frac-
tional Itˆo integrals have expectation zero as it is seen from properties (3.53), (3.71)

and their deﬁnition (3.77). Henceforth, using the model’s deﬁnition (1.103) we can

for i = 1, 2. This equation should be understood within
∗H—it has nothing to do with
the usual concept of derivative: we have used the chain rule and the fractional white

noise deﬁnition (3.65).

The procedure to interpret equation (4.30) requires to replace all the ordinary
products containing stochastic variables by Wick products. If we do not follow this

rule, the integrals should be interpreted as Stratonovich integrals. Thus, we observe
from (3.80) that the mean value of the solution is non-zero, and we do not want that.

Still, besides the changes, we have a non-linear stochastic diﬀerential equation. Worse
than that, we have a composition of two stochastic processes. We have to ﬁnd a
reasonable way to deﬁne it. In the last chapter we explained that because any analytic

function is expressed by a power series, it can be extended into the Hida space—
whenever a stochastic process is an argument for it—by replacing the powers by Wick

powers. We are going to extend this substitution rule. The representation for the
∗H is a series with analytic functions as components (3.65); thus, it is valid

in the distribution Hida space. Their proof is based on the existence of a bound via
q. The same theorem can also be shown valid in the fractional Hida

4.4 Ray-light Statistics: a Test Case

In this section we will use the stochastic ray-equation solution to study the behavior of
the displacements with respect to the characteristic variables of the system: C 2
ε , l0 and
L. We note that both coordinates of displacement are independent, and they also hold
the same (non-coupled) diﬀerential equation. It is enough to consider a 1-dimensional

case then. The parameter election (4.17), we have used in our treatment, also deﬁnes
the meaning of the transversal velocities, for they are the angles of deviation. Being

the velocities continuous we can set,

˙Q0 := lim
0
→

ǫ

˙Q(ǫ) = θ

|ǫ=0 ∈ S

∗H .

Since our solution is dependent of the initial refractive angle θ, its behavior at the
boundary, ǫ
0, should be given. This boundary is just the interface between tur-
bulent and resting air. Henceforth, we will also model the initial angle as a fractional

→

Brownian motion,

θ(ǫ) = c

the constant c is adimensional and measures the strength of the noise. The length

ǫ works as a kind of correlation distance, as it goes to zero we are examining the
properties of the interface’s short-range correlation.

Besides, any stochastic process can be put in terms of the spans described in the
past chapter, and these depend on the construction of stochastic integrals by step
functions. In any case, even if the former model needs to be corrected—maybe the

interface introduces long-range correlations—the next results are useful; since, they
are the building blocks for more complex stochastic processes—see p. 101.

Now, using the chaos expansion (4.48) and the initial conditions given here, the

solution (4.38) is written :

Conclusions

We started Chapter 1 making a revision of the up-to-date Passive Scalar Fields prop-
erties. Also, we have shown the refractive index is among them: this is well-known

in Atmospheric Optics. Nevertheless, the progress made in Fluid Dynamics on scalar
turbulence has hardly impacted turbulent propagation. Later on, we compared the
properties a fair model should comply against those followed by actual optical models.

Afterwards, we formulated the properties that make the family of isotropic fractional
Brownian motion a good candidate to simulate the turbulent refractive index:

•

The Structure Function asociated to the index µ, a scalar ﬁeld, obeys the power
2H with 0 < H < 1. The value of the (Hurst) parameter H depends
law
on the state of the turbulence: H > 1/2 for highly anisotropic scalar turbulence,

∼ k

k

r

and H < 1/2, almost always near 1/3, whenever the forces that generate the
turbulence are not relevant.

•

•

The Structure Function dependence in r induces a variance corresponding to a
non-diﬀerentiable process.

It is assumed a Gaussian process. This is an ad-hoc supposition widely used

among the literature: it is specially applied when the process plays the role of a
source in a ﬂuid equation. This approximation is good whenever we are interested

in the low moments associated to the stochastic process.

We have proved our proposed model (1.105) fulﬁlls all these conditions. Moreover,
we obtained its fractal dimension, equation (1.93), matches the estimated by (Con-
stantin et al., 1991) for passive scalar: dim ǫ−
determines the state of the turbulence.

Conclusions

Finally, we must stress this model give us a local structure function for the refractive
index—as suggested by P´erez and Garavaglia (2001) and some preliminar experimental

measures.

On Chapter 2 we have shown under what conditions the wave-equation bring to us

the paraxial approximation. Then, following Charnotsk˘ı et al. (1993) we have written
its Green function using a path integral velocity representation.

All over this chapter the Markovian approximation is used. It has dominated the

Atmospheric Optics scenario among the classic models. As it was noted, this model
discriminates the direction of propagation, z, from the remaining coordinates. Implying

a Brownian motion governs the behavior in that direction, that is,

ǫ(ρ, z)

W (z).

∝

Thus, we used this model to calculate the eﬀects of the turbulence over a system of
grids (P´erez and Garavaglia, 1999). First, we have analized the image formation with
and without turbulence. We observe the grids arrangement naturaly selects certains

positions where the visibility is diﬀerent from zero; that is, the formation of auto-
images. After the introduction of the turbulence this property remains unchanged.

On the other hand, the quality of the image is degradated.

It depends on the
geometry of the grids, represented by d and L, as it is shown in ﬁgures (2.5) and (2.6).
In the particular case d
, the visibility behaves as if the turbulence were absent

in coincidence with Zavorotny (1988).

→ ∞

Since the turbulent medium produces a cut-oﬀ in Fourier series for the irradiance

pattern introduces a method to evaluate the structure constant C 2

ε as we showed.

Finally, with the tools exposed in the third chapter we can advance to Chapter 4

and solve the ray-equation coming from the Geometric Optics in the turbulent case.

At the introduction to this chapter we have shown substantial diﬀerences between
our model and the Markovian approximation. We also proved that in the markovian

case it is admisible to commutate derivatives and averages—this is assumed true in
Optics not caring about the kind of process at hand. Also, this approximation has
fractal dimension equal to 2 1
2, and thus it is not capable of determine the state of the
turbulence. There are other models like thise. For example a set of fractal screens
equispaced has dimension less than 2, and therefore it completely falls out of the

Conclusions

foretold range for scalar ﬁelds.

Next, we gave an alternative demonstration to Synge (1937)’s to ﬁnd ray-equations

for the (singular) optical lagrangian. The equations for ray light trayectories coming
from this lagrangian are nonlinear, and then we proceed to linearize them.

We speciﬁcally studied the H > 1/2 problem. The motivations for such a choice are
various. From the mathematical point of view, we were able to deﬁne a composition
of stochastic processes. Afterwards, we have shown the ﬁrst order ray-equation cor-

responds to a Stochastic Volterra Equation. Moreover, we have shown that a unique
analitical solution exists. This solution was expressed as kernel convolutions can be

rewritten by means of a chaos expansion; thus, turning it into a manageable expression.
This analysis covers a priori only those cases where average temperature gradients
are relevant, that is, introduce strong anisotrophies. This behavior is likely to be found

at the laboratory. Usually, these experiences disregard the process of turbulence mak-
ing. It is considered that aligning a row of heaters along the ray trajectory (eventually

using fans) and taking measures at a couple of meters high above them (e.g. Consortini
et al., 1996) is enough to produce a completly developed turbulence. This asumption
is at least ingenuous. As we have seen the conditions for isotropy and homogeneity are

diﬃcult to obtain. First, it must be known for certain the non-existence of a convective
turbulence; that is, we must observe small Rayleigh numbers for the system (p. 33).

Also, an inertial tubulence does not necesarly produces an isotropic and homogeneous
scalar turbulence. As was shown by Villermaux and Gagne (1994), true isotropic and
homogeneous scalars ﬁelds are obtained making the turbulent ﬂow circulate through

some particular grid arrangement.

The validity range for our solution contains all the possible distances at the laboratory—
106m. Therefore, our problem is completly determined by the initial conditions;
L
our election of the incoming angle as a fBm (4.54) is the right choice given the behavior
of the scalar quantities. Since this condition is related to short-range correlations we

≪

should ﬁnd the constant c depends on the inner scale and the structure constant.

Afterwards, when we use the solution (4.67) to estimate the variance of a laser

Nevertheless, this result is coherent with the markovian model since the stochastic

happens in our case. On the other hand, supposing the extension for H

We observe that in the case H > 1/2 consecutive increments tend to have the same
sign, they are persistent. For the Brownian motion these are as likely to have the same

sign as the opposite. While in the last case H < 1/2 the increments are more likely to
have opposite signs, and so we call them anti-persitent.

As we did with the translation, we deﬁne the operator φα such that (f

φα and αHX have the
f (αt). We say then the process X is scalar invariant if both X
same probability distribution for any α and H. For 0 < H < 1 the fractional Brownian

motion is scalar-invariant:

BH (αs) d= αHBH (s),

for any α,

(A.11)

where d= means they share the same probability law. Usually scalar-invariant processes
are called self-similar if they have stationary increments.

It is worth mentioning that given the change of variable Φ : T

T ′, with Φ an
invective transformation, the redeﬁned stochastic process Zt = XΦ(t) is also a Gaussian
process over T with mean µ(t) = µ′(Φ(t)) and covariance

→

v(s, t) = v′(Φ(s), Φ(t)),

(A.12)

where µ and Φ are those deﬁned for the original process X.

The fractional Brownian motion processes are not diﬀerentiable with probability
12. This result can be proven from the following lemma found in Cram´er and Lead-
better (1967, §9.4): If a Gaussian process X is diﬀerentiable in t with prob. 1 then
(∂2v/∂s ∂t)(t, t), v(s, t) is the covariance function of the process. Therefore, the co-

the potential theory. It is known (Falconer, 1990, Theorem 4.13, p. 64) that given a

Markovian Model for the Turbulent Refractive Index

The markovian model we introduced in Chapter 1 determines a preferred direction

of propagation, let us say the z-axis, and thus the behavior across this direction is
diﬀerent from those perpendicular to it. That is, its increments the are independent,
so they do not have memory of their past. This property, as we mentioned earlier,

describes a martingale or markovian process.

Here we will show how the function A in equation (1.101) can be built from the

original structure function. Let us begin with a locally homogeneous process X having
as structure function the following:

DX(r) =

X(r + r′)

Moreover, if we assume it is stationary and Gaussian, as discussed on page 143, its
correlation function has a spectral representation (Shiryayev (1984), p. 387)

Validity Range of the Path Integral Representation

To study the validity range of the Feymann’s path integral representation we will look

at the energy ﬂux of a point source radiation through a pupil. If the pupil’s transfer
function is O(R) then we have

The reciprocity principle implies that this is equivalent to the irradiance I evaluated
at the point (0, L) provided the initial irradiance distribution function is the same as
the transfer function.

being larger than the coherence radius, is likely to occur in many situations, even for
short propagation path, so the only viable tool is the strong-scintillation approach

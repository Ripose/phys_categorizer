Susceptibilities

Truncated sum rules have been used to calculate the fundamental limits of the nonlinear suscep-
tibilities; and, the results have been consistent with all measured molecules. However, given that
ﬁnite-state models result in inconsistencies in the sum rules, it is not clear why the method works. In
this paper, the assumptions inherent in the truncation process are discussed and arguments based on
physical grounds are presented in support of using truncated sum rules in calculating fundamental
limits. The clipped harmonic oscillator is used as an illustration of how the validity of truncation
can be tested; and, several limiting cases are discussed as examples of the nuances inherent in the
method.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Truncated sum rules were ﬁrst used at the turn of
the century to calculate the fundamental limits of the
oﬀ-resonant hyperpolarizability β,[1, 2] and the second
hyperpolarizability, γ.[3, 4] The role of oﬀ-diagonal el-
ements, such as measured with Hyper Rayleigh Scat-
tering, were also considered.[5] These calculations were
later applied to calculating the resonant two-photon ab-
sorption cross-section[6] as well as the maximum possible
two-photon absorption cross-section when a molecule is
doubly-resonant with the excitation source.[7] The the-
ory is supported by the fact that no molecule has ever
been found to break the fundamental limit.[8]

While all molecules ever measured were found to fall
below the limit, it was pointed out that there is a gap be-
tween the fundamental limit and the molecules with the
largest measured nonlinear-optical susceptibility.[2, 4, 9]
This apparent limit, a factor of 103/2 below the funda-
mental limit, had two possible implications. Either, the
theory could be ﬂawed so that it overestimated the fun-
damental limit by more than a factor of thirty; or there
was another factor that acted to suppress the nonlinear-
optical response. To test the hypothesis that the theory
has overestimated the nonlinear response, all one needs to
do is show that a system exists whose hyperpolarizability
exceeds the apparent limit. The clipped harmonic oscilla-
tor, whose hyperpolarizability can be calculated analyt-
ically without approximation, has a hyperpolarizability
that is an order of magnitude larger than the apparent
limit, yet about a factor of two below the fundamental
limit.[10] Given that very talented organic chemists have
been working almost three decades to improve the hy-
perpolarizability of molecules through structure-property
studies, and no molecule has ever been found to breach
the apparent limit, it is probably prudent to conclude
that the best organic molecules fall below the apparent
limit.

While nanoengineering methods have been used to in-
crease the second hyperpolarizability per molecule to

within a factor of two of the fundamental limit,[11] a
more careful analysis of this case shows that the interac-
tions between molecules makes them respond collectively.
As such, the collection of molecules is acting like a single
supermolecule where its response is still well below the
apparent limit. So, the state of aﬀairs with regards to
molecular hyperpolarizabilities is that all molecules ever
measured and all analytical calculations of β and γ ever
performed fall below the fundamental limit, though some
of the calculations come close. This set of evidence sup-
ports the theory of fundamental limits. So, while the
process of truncating the sum rules and applying them
to the analysis of the Sum Over States (SOS) expression
for β could lead to pathologies, the results of this process
seems consistent with observation.

II. THEORY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMIT

This section develops the theory of the fundamental
limits of the hyperpolarizability (the second hyperpolar-
izability follows along the same lines but is algebraically
more messy, so will not be presented here). The method
presented follows the literature,[1, 2] but, close attention
will be focused on the assumptions underlying the cal-
culations and all of the details will be presented with
commentary on their meaning.

which relate the matrix elements of the position operator,
Em, between
xnm, to the energy diﬀerences, Enm = En −
the states n, and m. Since the sum rules derive directly
from the Schr¨odinger Equation, they are of a fundamen-
tal nature and apply to all systems in which one can write
a potential energy function. Note that Equation 1 yields
a distinct equation for each distinct pair of values of m,
and p. As such, we will refer to the sum rule equation

with indices m and p as Equation Xmp. When the sum
rules are truncated to include only ℓ terms (i.e. the sum
over n in Equation 1 ranges from 0 to ℓ
1), we will refer
to the truncated sum rule as x(ℓ)
nm.

A. Linear Susceptibility

We begin by treating the linear susceptibility, which
is the simplest possible case. A quantum perturbation

tem, α, yields,

where ω is the frequency of light, ωn0 the transition fre-

oﬀ-resonance limit, where ω
0 and calculate the real
part of the polarizability, where Re[α], where γn0 = 0,

where we have used En0 = ~ωn0.

Now we use the non-truncated sum rules to simplify
Equation 3. The sum rule Equation X00 (Equation 1

then clearly, the maximum value of α is obtained by plac-
ing all of the oscillator strength into the ﬁrst excited state
and setting all of the other transition moments to zero,
that is xn0 = 0 for n > 1. Note that when all of the tran-
sition moment is concentrated into the ﬁrst excited state,
x10 takes on its maximum value as given by Equation 7.

The important lesson of this calculation is that in the
limit of maximal α, the oscillator strength gets concen-
trated into the transition between the ground and ﬁrst
excited state. It is instructive to treat this problem as
a three-level system where the SOS expression includes
only the ground and ﬁrst two excited states; and simi-
larly, to truncate the sum rules to three levels.

The three-level model for α is given by

Using the reduced three-level model, we assume that
the energy parameter, E, and the transition moment pa-
rameter, X, are independent variables. Figure 1 shows
a plot of h(X, E) as a function of X for several values
of E. Clearly, h(X = 1, E) = 1 for all values of E, so,
the three-level model yields the same maximum value of
α = αMAX as the inﬁnite-state result.

The reduced three-level model yields insights into the
nature of fundamental limits. First, the fact that X = 1
at the fundamental limit clearly shows that all of the
oscillator strength must reside in the ﬁrst excited state.
This is consistent with the results of the inﬁnite level
model. Secondly, note that at E = 1, when the two ex-
cited states are degenerate, the polarizability is at the
fundamental limit for all possessible values of the tran-
sition moment to the ﬁrst excited state. This behavior

(15)

As such, the degenerate case acts like a two-level model.
This simple example shows that the fundamental limit
of the polarizability occurs when all of the oscillator
strength is concentrated in the transition to the ﬁrst ex-
cited state. As such, it is suﬃcient to consider only a
reduced three-level model since this is a good approxi-
mation for any quantum system that has a polarizability
near its maximum value.

B. Nonlinear Polarizability

In the case of the hyperpolarizability and higher-order
polarizabilities, the sum-over-states expressions are so
complicated that it is not possible to calculate the exact
result as we did for α. In the linear case, we concluded
that the fundamental limit occurs when all the oscilla-
tor strength is concentrated into one transition. How-
ever, the nonlinear susceptibilities depend on two types
of terms. So, it would not be unreasonable to expect that
the oscillator strength may need to be shared between at
least two excited states.

Assuming that a fundamental limit indeed exists, we

therefore use the following ansatz:[12]

•

Ansatz:
In the limit when the static nonlinear
polarizability of a bound quantum system in its
ground state approaches the fundamental limit, the
only allowable non-vanishing matrix elements of the
dipole operator are described by a 3

3 matrix.

×

and

3

An important consequence of this ansatz is that the sum
rules must be truncated, resulting in a ﬁnite number of
equations of the form X (3)
nm, with m < 3 and n < 3. The
set of truncated sum rules leads to several problems, such
as self inconsistencies. To deal with inconsistencies and
decide which set of sum rules are appropriate, we adopt
the following guiding principles:

1. The set of sum-rule equations must be self-

consistent.

2. The predictions following from the application of
the sum rules must be consistent with experiment.

3. When oﬀ-resonance, all measurable quantities

should be free from divergences.

Our ﬁrst priority is to decide on the fundamental set
of sum-rule equations. First, we note that sum rule
equation X (3)
22 yields a nonsensical result, and, it is in-
consistent with the sum rule equation X (3)
00 . Based on
Principles 1 and 2, we eliminate X (3)
22 . Secondly, we
note that the remaining sum-rule equations are overly
restrictive since they predict that all molecules should
have the same ratio, E. This violates Principle 2 since
molecules with a continuous spectrum of E vales are ob-
served. As such, we must drop at least one additional
equation. To determine which equation to drop, we go
through the process of dropping one equation, and an-
alyzing the ramiﬁcations of the remaining set. We ﬁnd
that the only equation that can be dropped, which leaves
a set of equations that do not result in divergences in
the calculated oﬀ-resonant nonlinear susceptibilities (i.e.
obeys Principle 3), is X (3)
21 .[13] If we drop an additional
equation, then the result one gets is that there is no limit
on the susceptibility. Since experiment strongly suggests
that the nonlinear-optical response can not be arbitrar-
ily large, we conclude that the 4 independent equations
X (3)
20 form the complete set. (Note
that Equations X (3)
mn are complex conjugates of
each other, and for a real dipole matrix, are identical.)

The process of applying the truncated sum rules to the

III. ANALYSIS

FIG. 2: Contour plot of κ(3)

mp. Inset shows matrix elements.

In this section, we develop a method for analyzing the
validity of using truncated sum rules by studying how
the truncated series compares with the exact results. We
begin by deﬁning the κ-matrix, which derives from the
sum rules given by Equation 1,

κ(ℓ)
mp = δm,p −

m
~2N

ℓ

n=0
X

(Enm + Enp) xmnxnp.

(21)

Note that κ-matrix is a generalization of an idea ﬁrst pro-
posed by Champagne and Kirtman.[14] If the sums rules
are exactly obeyed, the κ-matrix vanishes. Therefore,
kappa is calculated for a given system by substituting
the known values of the transition moments and energies
into Equation 21. Deviations of κ(ℓ)
mp from zero is a sign
that either the act of truncation in inaccurate; or that
the matrix elements of the dipole operator and energies
are incorrect for that particular system.

In order to test the pathologies associated with trunca-
tion, we must start with a potential energy function for
which the Schr¨odinger Equation can be solved analyti-
cally. This approach ensures that the energies and dipole
matrix elements are physically sound and that patholo-
gies or inaccuracies inherent in approximation techniques
are avoided. The clipped harmonic oscillator (CHO)
is the ideal system(where the potential is harmonic for
x > 0 and inﬁnite for x < 0) since it is the simplest
case of an asymmetric potential that yields a hyperpo-
larizability that is near the fundamental limit.[10] The
matrix elements of the position operator of the clipped
harmonic oscillator (CHO) are given by,

xmn = xMAX

Figure 2 shows a surface plot of κ(3)

mp and the inset
shows the matrix elements. Recall that the κ-matrix is a
measure of the fractional deviation of the particular trun-
cated sum-rule equation X (ℓ)
nm. As such, when truncating
to three levels, the sum rule X (3)
00 with the clipped har-
monic oscillator wavefunctions gives a deviation of less
than 7% from the inﬁnite-level case. The sum rule equa-
tions X (3)
22 , which we dropped from our analysis,
deviate by 82% and almost 270%, respectively.

12 and X (3)

Since the clipped harmonic oscillator’s hyperpolariz-
ability is near the fundamental limit, we would expect
that the three-level sum rules that are kept in the anal-
ysis to deviate substantially less than the equations that
are dropped. Figure 3 conﬁrms that the domain of the
sum rules used in our maximization calculation is rela-
tively ﬂat.

To show how quickly the sum rules converge, and how
well the exact clipped harmonic oscillator obeys them, we
consider a 32-level model. Figure 3 shows a contour plot
of κ(32)
. First, we note that the deviations
alternate sign when m + p changes from even to odd.
(This same pattern is also observed for κ(3)
mp in Figure
2.) The jagged line in Figure 3 represents the point at
which κ(32)
0.025. The areas that are shaded black

represented matrix elements of κ that are larger than 0.1.
As such, most of the sum rules are accurate. Indeed, even
κ(10)
mp converges quickly and the deviations are small for
all sum rule equations for m + p < 10.

call that in the case of the three-level model, we ignored

physical results. The κ-matrix may be a useful tool in
studying which sum rule equations that need to be dis-
carded in higher-level models.

22 for contradicting X (3)

It is interesting to speculate whether the abrupt sign
changes in the κ-matrix may result in a cancellation of
terms in the SOS expression for the nonlinear-optical sus-
ceptibility; and, if small errors in the matrix elements
may lead to large uncertainties in the nonlinear-optical
response.

To test this hypothesis, the matrix elements and ener-
gies of the clipped harmonic oscillator were recalculated
with random ﬂuctuations of
5 % added to each using
the equations,

So, it appears that a small error in the matrix elements
and energies can lead to a large violation of the sum rules.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have shown that the sum rules
can be used to calculate the fundamental limits of the
nonlinear-optical susceptibility provided that the system
approaches a three-level model as β and γ approach the
fundamental limit. This process of truncating the sum
rules and demanding that the fundamental limit occurs
in the three-level limit is motivated by exact results that
are calculated for the polarizability. We introduce three
guiding principles that aid us in determining which sum
rule equations should be dropped, and show that the fun-
damental limit is unique. Furthermore, we introduce a
method for testing the validity of the transition moments
and energy levels and ﬁnd that even small errors in them
can lead to large violations of the sum rules. As such, this
method is ideal for testing the results of semi-empirical
calculations.

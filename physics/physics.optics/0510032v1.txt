The Fourier inversion of phased coherent diﬀraction patterns oﬀers images without the resolution
and depth-of-focus limitations of lens-based tomographic systems. We report on our recent experi-
mental images inverted using recent developments in phase retrieval algorithms, and summarize ef-
forts that led to these accomplishments. These include ab-initio reconstruction of a two-dimensional
test pattern, inﬁnite depth of focus image of a thick object, and its high-resolution (∼ 10 nm res-
olution) three-dimensional image. Developments on the structural imaging of low density aerogel
samples are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

these proceedings by Lima.3

In the last ﬁve years or so several new ideas have
combined to provide us with a working solution to the
phase problem for non-periodic objects. This capabil-
ity opens exciting possibilities for using coherent x-ray
diﬀraction microscopy (CXDM) for 3D imaging of few-
micron-sized objects at resolution levels previously in-
accessible to x-ray microscopy. Since the ﬁrst proof of
principle demonstration of CXDM1, a number of groups
have been working to bring these possibilities into real-
ity. Recent estimates2 of the dose and ﬂux requirements
of such measurements, indicate that attractive resolution
values (about 10 nm for life science and 2–4 nm for mate-
rial science) should be possible with reasonable exposure
times using modern synchrotron-radiation sources. Thus
CXDM promises a 3D resolution limited only by radi-
ation damage, the collection solid angle and the num-
ber of x-rays collected. We therefore expect to have an
advantage over lens-based tomography schemes that are
currently limited in resolution and eﬃciency by the lens
fabrication technology and, in principle, by the depth
of focus eﬀect. This capability provides an extremely
valuable tool for understanding nanoscience, such as the
study of minimum energy pathways for crack propagation
in brittle solids, and characterizing the internal structure
of mesoporous structures that are synthesized for a wide
range of applications.

In this paper we review the historical developments
which have led to these opportunities and describe some
of the activities of our multi-institutional collaboration,
working at beam line 9.0.1 at the Advanced Light Source
at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In par-
ticular we will describe here two experiments, which
demonstrate spectacular 3D imaging at 10 nm resolution.
The portion of the work devoted to life-science imaging,
largely by the Stony Brook group, has been reported in

II. CONCEPTUAL HISTORY

The observation by Sayre in 19524 that Bragg diﬀrac-
tion under-samples the diﬀracted intensity pattern was
important and led to more speciﬁc proposals by the
same author for X-ray diﬀractive imaging of non-periodic
objects.5 These ideas, combined with the rapid develop-
ment of computational phase retrieval in the wider op-
tics community especially the “support constraint”6,7,8,
enabled the ﬁrst successful use of CXDM. An important
review, which attempted to integrate the approaches of
the optical and crystallographic communities, appeared
in 1990.9 The connection was made between the ”solvent-
ﬂattening” or ”density-modiﬁcation” techniques of crys-
tallography and the compact support requirements of the
hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm. The importance
of ﬁne sampling of the intensity of the measured diﬀrac-
tion pattern was recognised at an early stage10 and has
led to the method being referred to as ”oversampling”,
since the Shannon sampling interval is half the Bragg
interval in each dimension. The result of Shannon sam-
pling the intensity is that the diﬀracted phased amplitude
is at least two-fold oversampled in each dimension, which
implies that the object obtained by transformation of an
exactly-known amplitude function will be surrounded by
a zero-padded region of at least three times the object
area for 2D reconstructions, or at least seven times the
object volume for 3D reconstructions. Such zero padding
is a necessary concomitant of the use of a support con-
straint, although it is suﬃcient to oversample at less than
the factor of two per dimension11. The use of the support
constraint as a means to phase the diﬀraction pattern is
now very widespread in the growing CXDM community.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Our experiments reported here were carried out us-
ing the abovementioned Stony Brook University diﬀrac-
tion apparatus, as well as an earlier apparatus20. In the
Stony Brook apparatus we carried out experiments using
750 eV (1.65 nm wavelength) X-rays that were selected
from the undulator spectrum by a zone-plate monochro-

III. EXPERIMENTS WITH X-RAYS

In spite of the promise shown in simulations, the above
theoretical advances were not accompanied by immedi-
ate experimental progress in the practical application of
phase retrieval. The ﬁrst successful X-ray technique was
developed by the Stony Brook group at the X1 undulator
beam line at the National Synchrotron Light Source at
Brookhaven. The fruit of this eﬀort, reported by Miao,
Charalambous, Kirz and Sayre in 1999,1 was the ﬁrst in-
version of an experimental X-ray diﬀraction pattern to
an image of a non-periodic object at 75 nm resolution.
This success proved to be the beginning of a signiﬁcant
expansion in interest in CXDI in the US.

In the last few years CXDM activities in the US has
involved four groups which have all made contributions
to the XRM 2005 conference: Stony Brook/Brookhaven,
University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Univer-
sity of Illinois / Argonne, and ourselves at University of
Arizona / Livermore Lab / Berkeley Lab. Stony Brook /
Brookhaven have constructed a sophisticated experimen-
tal station for tomographic imaging of life-science speci-
mens at cryogenic temperatures.12 This apparatus is now
installed at ALS beam line 9.0.113 and serves all of the
groups doing CXDM at the ALS. Robinson and cowork-
ers at the University of Illinois have applied the princi-
ples of CXDM to hard x-ray experiments on microcrys-
talline particles, the density variations of which produce
a diﬀraction pattern centered on each Bragg spot. The
pattern can be reconstructed in 2D14 or scanned in 3D by
very slight rotation of the crystal to give the equivalent
of a tilt series. Such data have been reconstructed tomo-
graphically to produce a 3D image at 80 nm resolution.15
Miao (now at UCLA) and coworkers have made consid-
erable progress in pushing the CXDI method to higher
resolution in 2D (7 nm), higher x-ray energies and to
a limited form of 3D.16 They have also made the ﬁrst
application of CXDM to a biological sample.17

Our own eﬀorts in this area have concentrated on re-
trieving phase based on the diﬀraction data alone18, three

mator with a spectral resolution of λ/∆λ=1000. The
4-µm-diameter monochromator exit pinhole also selects
a transversely spatially coherent patch of the beam. The
sample was located 20 mm from this pinhole. A direct-
detection bare CCD detector, with 20 µm pixel spac-
ing, 1340×1300 pixels, was located 142 mm behind the
sample. At these CCD and wavelength settings we have
an object sampling interval in x and y of ∆x = 9.8 nm
(in the small-angle approximation) and a ﬁeld width of
w = N ∆x= 11.7 µm. A beam-stop blocks the direct
undiﬀracted beam from impinging on the CCD. More
details are given by Beetz et al.12. Diﬀraction patterns
were collected with the sample oriented at rotation an-
gles φ of -60◦ to +60◦, at 1◦ intervals. Total exposure
time was about 3 hours per sample.

Test samples were made by placing a droplet of so-
lution containing unconjugated colloidal gold balls on a
silicon nitride membrane (thickness 100 nm) and allowing
it to dry. A two dimensional object was imaged without
prior knowledge about its shape by periodically updating
the support region based on the current object estimate
(Fig. 1)18.

A three-dimensional test sample was produced by
placing a droplet of colloidal gold solution on a three-
dimensional silicon nitride pyramid-shaped membrane.19
This drop quickly evaporated and left the gold balls in
a characteristic pattern where the gold tended to ﬁll in
the edges of the pyramid. An SEM image of the object is
shown in Fig. 2. The pyramid base width is 2.5 µm and
the height (base to apex) is 1.8 µm. An earlier, larger,
silicon nitride pyramid object is shown on the right side
of Fig. 2.

Two dimensional projection images may be recovered
from the diﬀraction intensities without having to ﬁrst
undergo a full 3D reconstruction, and we found this is
a useful step to quickly examine our 3D datasets. The
diﬀraction intensities from a single sample orientation are
recorded on the Ewald sphere and will have the same
depth of focus as a microscope with NA equivalent to the
solid angle intercepted by the CCD. For our experimental
parameters, giving NA = 0.084, we have a depth of focus
of 120 nm, which is considerably smaller than the 1.8
µm thickness of the pyramid object. A reconstructed
image, from a single-view diﬀraction pattern is shown in
Fig. 3(a). Artifacts due to defocus are clearly seen in
the image. By the choice of the parabolic term of the
retreived phases23 the plane of focus can be numerically
scanned throughout the depth of the object.

By sectioning the three dimensional Fourier space with
a sphere of larger radius than the Ewald surface, we can
increase the depth of focus. Inﬁnite depth-of-focus two-
dimensional projection images were obtained (Fig 3b)
from a plane in reciprocal space perpendicular to the pro-
jection direction (Fig. 3c)19.

A full 3D image was obtained19 by performing phase
retrieval8,21 on the entire 3D diﬀraction dataset. The
reconstructed volume image reveals the structure of the
object in all three dimensions and can be visualized in

many ways including isosurface renderings, projections
through the data (Fig. 4), or slices (tomographs) of the
data.

We have applied 3D diﬀraction imaging to determin-
ing the 3D structure of low density aerogel foam samples.
These metal oxide foams are low density (100 mg/cc) and
have an internal skeleton structure composed of Ta2O5.
Our full 3D reconstructions were obtained with no a pri-
ori information about the sample, including no measure-
ment of the missing low spatial frequency data in the
beamstop region. The reconstructed image, shown in
Fig. 5, reveals not only the particle shape, but also in-
ternal foam structure such as the strut geometry, which
can be used to calculate the foam mechanical properties.
Further details will be given in another paper.

V. PHASE RETRIEVAL AND IMAGE
ANALYSIS

We overcame two key computational challenges in im-
plementing high-resolution 3D phase retrieval,22 specif-
ically performing the numerous 1k3 FFTs required for
phase retrieval in a reasonable time and managing the
memory requirements of large 3D data sets. Memory
and calculation requirements are signiﬁcant and suggest
a cluster-based solution. The FFTs (dist ﬀt) have been
optimised for the G5 vector processor architecture by
the Apple Advanced Computation Group and uses stan-
dard MPI interfaces to perform distributed giga-element

4

or larger FFTs. Reconstruction code is written in C, is
fully parallelised, and uses distributed memory and MPI
interfaces to share the workload across all CPUs in the
system. This includes application of real and Fourier
space constraints and dynamic support reﬁnement using
the Shrinkwap algorithm.

Using 16 G5 Macintosh computers with Inﬁniband in-
terconnects we achieve an FFT speed of 7.9 sec/FFT on
a 10243 voxel data set, giving a full reconstruction time
of 14 hours (based on 2000 iterations, 2 FFTs per itera-
tion plus other ﬂoating point operations needed for the
reconstruction). Timings for a 5123 data cube are 850
msec/FFT, enabling us to perform a full reconstruction
in 1.5 hrs.

VI. HOLOGRAPHIC-ENHANCED PHASE
RETRIEVAL

It was noted that the autocorrelation functions in
some of this work also included faithful, although low-
resolution, holographic images of some of the clusters,
due to the occurrence of a single isolated ball near the
object.
In analogy with the “heavy atom” method of
crystallography, by placing a reference point object near
the sample we can obtain a one-step, estimate of the sup-
port function. Although the holographic image is noisier
than the recovered image (Fig. 7), it provides a useful
starting point to the algorithm.

FIG. 6: Line-outs of the real part of the reconstructed com-
plex amplitude 3D image, through the isolated single ball at
the pyramid apex. Dashed lines show a simulated 3D coherent
◦
image with a cube OTF of 10 nm resolution and with a 60
missing sector19. The lineout through three lines (d) demon-
strates that the resolution is suﬃcient to clearly distinguish
between diﬀerent 50 nm gold spheres.

Although we cannot exactly quantify the resolution of
the image, which would require knowing the object’s 3D
structure, our analysis shows we can consistently retrieve
phases out to the maximum spatial frequency recorded19
(further improvements in.23 A line-out through the re-
constructed image can easily resolve 50 nm spheres that
are touching each other (see Fig. 6). From such image
line-outs, and comparisons of reconstructed X-ray im-
ages with the SEM image, we have conﬁdence that our
achieved image resolution is close to 10 nm. Further anal-
ysis of the consistency of the retrieved phases, and the
agreement of the Fourier amplitudes of the reconstructed
image with the data, back up this assertion19,23.

FIG. 7: Fourier transform of the diﬀraction pattern of the
object illuminated with a large beam: the central part of the
picture shows the autocorrelation of the pyramid, but some
reference points produce oﬀ-centered holograms.

Inspired by this holographic method to help the phase
retrieval step (see also23, we developed a methodology
to deposit controlled reference points near the object by
metallorganic deposition using a focused ion beam. Our
initial trials are illustrated in Fig. 8.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated ab-initio two dimensional im-
ages with inﬁnite depth of focus, and three dimensional
images of test objects at a resolution of 10 nm. Pre-
liminary images of areogel foams were presented. These
images of complicated and unknown objects, along with
the rigorous analysis of known test objects, show the ro-
bustness of our ab initio phase retrieval technique. In the
case of the aerogel particle, the reconstruction was per-
formed “blind” without the operator (A. Barty) of the
reconstruction software aware of the SEM image, or the
size or shape of the object.

While the recent experimental progress to date has
been rapid and extremely encouraging, we are looking
forward to further improvements in the technique, includ-
ing faster acquisition times (with an improved beamline)
that will allow us to achieve even higher image resolu-
tion. Given the scaling of required dose to the inverse
fourth power of resolution2, and estimates of coherent
ﬂux improvements achievable with an optimized beam-
line and undulator source, we estimate that we should be
able to achieve resolutions of 2–4 nm on material science
samples. Possible2 applications for the technique include
characterizing the pore structure of vesicular basalt, the
formation of voids in metals, and many other investiga-

tions of the nanoworld. The techniques that we have
developed will also be applied to exciting new prospects
for imaging of large macromolecules and assemblies at
near atomic-resolution imaging, which will be achieved
using X-ray free-electron lasers24 and aligned molecule
diﬀraction25.

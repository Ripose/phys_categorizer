Abstract

We studied the durations and average speeds of videopulses transmitted through
chiral sculptured thin ﬁlms using a ﬁnite–diﬀerence algorithm. The chiral STF was
either linear or possessed an intensity–dependent permittivity. Videopulse durations
tended to decrease with increasing carrier wavelength and to increase, for given carrier
wavelength and polarization state, when the chiral STF was nonlinear with intensity–
dependent permittivity. The rate of decrease in durations with wavelength was less
than that for longer–duration pulses. The eﬀect of the circular Bragg phenomenon was
swamped by the wide bandwidth possessed by videopulses. Two measures of videopulse
average speed did not change much with carrier wavelength, and decreased slightly, for
a given carrier wavelength and polarization state, in the nonlinear case. The other
measure of average speed tended to increase with increasing carrier wavelength, and
decrease, for a given carrier wavelength and polarization state, in the nonlinear case.

Introduction

When circularly polarized light is incident normally on a periodically nonhomogeneous,
structurally chiral medium of suﬃcient thickness—such as a chiral sculptured thin ﬁlm
(STF)—the circular Bragg phenomenon may occur [1]. The part of the light spectrum
that falls within a range known as the Bragg regime is largely reﬂected from the chiral
STF provided that the circular polarization state matches the structural handedness of the
medium. If the circular polarization state is opposite, little light is reﬂected.

Research has elucidated the time–domain mechanism of the circular Bragg phenomenon
as pulse bleeding, a continuous transfer of energy from the refracted pulse within the chiral
STF to the reﬂected pulse outside of it [2]. Pulse bleeding has also been predicted for
incident videopulses, which are about one or two optical cycles in duration [3]. The purpose

of this communication is to extend previous work on the quantiﬁcation of the durations and
average speeds of ultrashort optical pulses through chiral STFs to videopulses [4].

We computed three measures each of the durations and average speeds of videopulses
transmitted through linear and nonlinear chiral STFs. The videopulses had diﬀerent carrier
wavelengths and polarization states, and we identiﬁed trends in duration and average speed
as those parameters were varied.

Section 2 gives the constitutive relations of the chiral STFs studied, and explains the
measures of duration and average speed we used. Section 3 contains explanations of the
trends we identiﬁed.

2 Theory

Let us now describe the constitutive relations of the chiral STFs we studied and provide
deﬁnitions of the measures of videopulse duration and average speed we used.

2.1 Constitutive relations

The polarization P of a spatially local, dielectric, structurally right–handed chiral STF
occupying the slab region [zL, zR] depends on the electric ﬁeld E as follows:

nonlinearity parameter pnl determines whether the chiral STF will obey the superposition
principle; when pnl = 0 the ﬁlm is linear, but it exhibits an intensity–dependent permittivity
otherwise [5, 6].

2.2 Pulse durations and average speeds

A pulsed plane wave, consisting of a circularly polarized carrier plane wave ϕ (t) that is
amplitude–modulated by a pulse envelope ψ (t), was launched from the plane z = 0 towards
the chiral STF. The carrier plane wave was characterized by the carrier wavelength λcar
and whether it was left circularly polarized (LCP) or right circularly polarized (RCP). The
pulse envelope was gaussian as per

The propagation of the pulse was computed with a ﬁnite–diﬀerence method [4]. We
considered three measures of pulse duration—the equivalent, root mean square (RMS),
and correlation—and three measures of average speed—the peak, center–of–energy, and

3 Results

The results of our calculations for incident videopulses are presented in Figures 1 and 2.
The parameters describing the chiral STF were chosen as follows: p1 = 0.52, p2 = 0.42,
p3 = 0.40, N1,2,3 = 100, λ1 = 290 nm, λ2,3 = 280 nm, Ω = 200 nm, and α = 20◦; the
10−24 m2/V2). The
ﬁlm was either linear (case L, pnl = 0) or nonlinear (case N, pnl = 3
chiral STF was ten pitches thick (zL = 30 µm and zR = 34 µm). These parameters ﬁx the
center wavelength of the Bragg regime of the linear chiral STF to
516 nm and the full–
27 nm [10, 11]; but both quantitites will shift slightly
width half–maximum bandwidth to
10−24 m2/V2 [12]. The incident videopulses had the following parameters:
when pnl = 3
106 J/m2, τ0 = 0.4 fs, and td = 1.6 fs. They therefore comprised about 1

of 20 nm.

Several general trends are evident in Figures 1 and 2. The durations tended to decrease
with increasing carrier wavelength, and tended to increase, for given carrier wavelength and
polarization state, in going from the linear case to the nonlinear one. These two trends
were also noted in an earlier study for longer–duration (τ0 = 2 fs) incident pulses [4].
There are several diﬀerences between these results and the results of the previous study. In
Figure 1, there is a large spread between the three measures of duration. Moreover, the
decrease in durations with wavelength is less drastic in the case of videopulses than with the
longer–duration pulses we studied earlier. This comparison can be explained by recourse to
frequency–domain arguments as follows. The canonical refractive indexes of a chiral STF
decrease with increasing free–space wavelength above the resonance wavelengths, along with

the dispersion exhibited by the ﬁlm [4]. This decrease accounts for the decrease in durations
with increasing wavelength, as there is less dispersion at higher wavelengths to elongate
the pulse. As the duration of the incident pulse is decreased to that of a videopulse, its
bandwidth widens accordingly. This wider bandwidth causes the pulse to disperse more, for
a given carrier wavelength, than a pulse with narrower bandwidth. Therefore, the durations
of transmitted pulses decrease at a slower rate with increasing wavelength when the incident
pulses are of shorter duration.

Moreover, in our earlier work, we found that that there is a local maximum in the RMS
measure of duration when the chiral STF is linear and the circular Bragg phenomenon
occurs [4]. There is no such local maximum evident in Figure 1. We attribute this eﬀect to
the wide bandwidth of the videopulses as compared to the longer–duration pulses studied
earlier. The wide bandwidth eﬀectively swamps the circular Bragg phenomenon.

The center–of–energy speeds increase modestly with increasing wavelength; and they
decrease, for given carrier wavelength and polarization state, for the nonlinear case as com-
pared to the linear one. However, the peak and correlation speeds remain roughly constant
with increasing carrier wavelength, close in value, and larger than the center–of–energy
speeds. And the peak and correlation speeds decrease, for given carrier wavelength and po-
larization state, from the linear to the nonlinear case, but only slightly. The rate of increase
in center–of–energy speed with increasing carrier wavelength is less for videopulses than for
the longer–duration pulses we studied earlier [4].

We expect identiﬁcation of these trends to be useful to designers of chiral STF–based
devices. Such devices shall be limited to shaping pulses of bandwidth narrower than a
certain value, due to the swamping of the circular Bragg phenomenon by shorter–duration

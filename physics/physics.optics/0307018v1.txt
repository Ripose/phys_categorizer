Abstract

We propose in this article an unambiguous deﬁnition of the local density of electromagnetic states

(LDOS) in a vacuum near an interface in an equilibrium situation at temperature T . We show that

the LDOS depends only on the electric ﬁeld Green function of the system but does not reduce in

general to the trace of its imaginary part as often used in the literature. We illustrate this result by

a study of the LDOS variations with the distance to an interface and point out deviations from the

standard deﬁnition. We show nevertheless that this deﬁnition remains correct at frequencies close

to the material resonances such as surface polaritons. We also study the feasability of detecting

such a LDOS with apetureless SNOM techniques. We ﬁrst show that a thermal near-ﬁeld emission

spectrum above a sample should be detectable and that this measurement could give access to the

electromagnetic LDOS. It is further shown that the apertureless SNOM is the optical analog of

the scanning tunneling microscope which is known to detect the electronic LDOS. We also discuss

some recent SNOM experiments aimed at detecting the electromagnetic LDOS.

INTRODUCTION

The density of states (DOS) is a fundamental quantity from which many macroscopic

quantities can be derived. Indeed, once the DOS is known, the partition function can be

computed yielding the free energy of the system. It follows that the heat capacity, forces, etc

can be derived. A well-known example of a macroscopic quantity that follows immediately

from the knowledge of the electromagnetic DOS is the Casimir force1,2. Other examples are

shear forces3 and heat transfer4 between two semi-inﬁnite dielectrics. Recently, it has been

shown that unexpected coherence properties of thermal emission at short distances from an

interface separating vacuum from a polar material are due to the contribution to the density

of states of resonant surface waves5. It has also been shown that the Casimir force can be

interpreted as essentially due to the surface waves contribution to the DOS1,2.

Calculating and measuring the local density of states (LDOS) in the vicinity of an inter-

face separating a real material from a vacuum is therefore necessary to understand many

problems currently studied. The density of states is usually derived from the Green function

of the system by taking the imaginary part of the Green’s function6,7. In solid-state physics,

the electronic local density of states at the Fermi energy at the surface of a metal can be

measured with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)8. This has been proved by several

experiments, in particular the so-called quantum corral experiments9. Although one can

formally generalize the deﬁnition of the electromagnetic LDOS by using the trace of the

imaginary part of the Green’s tensor10, it turns out that this deﬁnition does not yield the

correct equilibrium electromagnetic energy density.

Recently, it has been shown theoretically that the STM and the Scanning Near-ﬁeld Op-

tical Microscope (SNOM) have strong analogies11. More precisely, in the weak tip-sample

coupling limit, it was demonstrated that a uniﬁed formalism can be used to relate the STM

signal to the electronic LDOS and the SNOM signal to electromagnetic LDOS. SNOM in-

struments12 have been used to perform diﬀerent kinds of emission spectroscopy, such as

luminescence13, Raman spectroscopy14 or two-photon ﬂuorescence15. For detection of in-

frared light, apertureless techniques16 have shown their reliability for imaging17 as well as

for vibrational spectroscopy on molecules18. Moreover, recent calculations and experiments

have shown that an optical analog of the quantum corral could be designed, and that the

measured SNOM images on such a structure present strong similarities with the calculated

2

electromagnetic LDOS22,23. These results suggest that the electromagnetic LDOS could be

directly measured with a SNOM.

The purpose of this article is to show how the electromagnetic LDOS can be related to the

electric Green-function, and to discuss possible measurements of the LDOS in SNOM. We

ﬁrst introduce a general deﬁnition of the electromagnetic LDOS in a vacuum in presence of

materials, possibly lossy objects. Then, we show that under some well-deﬁned circumstances,

the LDOS is proportional to the imaginary part of the trace of the electrical Green function.

The results are illustrated by calculating the LDOS above a metal surface. We show next

that the signal detected with a SNOM measuring the thermally emitted ﬁeld near a heated

body is closely related to the LDOS and conclude that the natural experiment to detect

the LDOS is to perform a near-ﬁeld thermal emission spectrum. We discuss the inﬂuence

of the tip shape. We also discuss whether standard SNOM measurements using an external

illumination can detect the electromagnetic LDOS22,23.

II. LOCAL DENSITY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC STATES IN A VACUUM

As pointed out in the introduction, the LDOS is often deﬁned as being the imaginary

part of the trace of the electric-ﬁeld Green dyadic. This approach seems to give a correct

description in some cases22,23, but to our knowledge this deﬁnition has never been derived

properly for electromagnetic ﬁelds in a general system that includes an arbitrary distribu-

tion of matter with possible losses. The aim of this section is to propose an unambiguous

deﬁnition of the LDOS.

Let us consider a system at equilibrium temperature T . Using statistical physics, we

write the electromagnetic energy U(ω) at a given positive frequency ω, as the product of the

DOS by the mean energy of a state at temperature T , so that

U(ω) = ρ(ω)

where 2π¯h is Planck’s constant and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. We can now introduce24

a local density of states by starting with the local density of electromagnetic energy energy

U(r, ω) at a given point r in space, and at a given frequency ω. This can be written by

deﬁnition of the LDOS ρ(r, ω) as

The density of electromagnetic energy is the sum of the electric energy and of the magnetic

energy. At equilibrium, it can be calculated using the system Green’s function and the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Let us introduce the electric and magnetic ﬁeld correlation

The goal of this section is to study the LDOS behavior for some well-characterised physical

situations, based on the result in Eq. (9).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Vacuum

In a vacuum, the imaginary part of the trace of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld Green

functions are equal.

Indeed, the electric and magnetic ﬁeld Green functions obeys the

same equations and have the same boundary conditions in this case (radiation condition

at inﬁnity).

In a vacuum, the LDOS is thus obtained by considering the electric ﬁeld

contribution only, and multiplying the result by a factor of two. One recovers the familiar

result

ρv(r, ω) = ρv(ω) =

ω2
π2c3

(10)

which shows in particular that the LDOS is homogeneous and isotropic.

B. Plane interface

Let us consider a plane interface separating a vacuum (medium 1, corresponding to the

upper half-space) from a semi-inﬁnite material (medium 2, corresponding to the lower half-

space) characterised by its complex dielectric constant ǫ2(ω) (the material is assumed to be

linear, isotropic and non-magnetic). Inserting the expressions of the electric and magnetic-

ﬁeld Green functions for this geometry20 into equation (9), one ﬁnds the expression of the

LDOS at a given frequency and at a given height z above the interface in vacuum.

In

this situation, the magnetic and electric Green functions are not the same. This is due to

the boundary counditions at the interface which are diﬀerent for the electric and magnetic

ﬁelds. In order to discuss the origin of the diﬀerent contributions to the LDOS, we deﬁne

and calculate an electric LDOS (ρE(z, ω)) due to the electric-ﬁeld Green function only, and a

magnetic LDOS (ρH(z, ω)) due to the magnetic-ﬁeld Green function only. The total LDOS

ρE(z, ω) = ρE(z, ω) + ρH(z, ω) has a clear physical meaning unlike ρE(z, ω) and ρH (z, ω).

Note that ρE(z, ω) is the quantity which is usually calculated and considered to be the true

It is important to note that the electric and magnetic LDOS have similar expressions, but

are in general not equal. The expression of ρH (r) is obtained by exchanging the s and p

polarisations in the expression of ρE(r). As a result, the two polarisations have a symmetric

role in the expression of the total LDOS ρ(r).

The vacuum situation can be recovered from the previous expression by setting the values

of the Fresnel reﬂection factors to zero. The same result is also obtained by taking the LDOS

at large distance from the interface, i.e, for z

λ where λ = 2πc/ω is the wavelength. This

≫
means that at large distances, the interface does not perturb the density of electromagnetic

states. In fact, e−2|p|ωz/c becomes negligible for the evanescent waves and e2ipωz/c is a rapidly

oscillating function for the propagating waves when integrating over κ. The result is that

all the terms containing exponential do not contribute to the integral giving the LDOS in

the vacuum.

Conversely, at short distance from the interface, ρ(r, ω) is drastically modiﬁed compared

to its free-space value. Equations (11)-(13) show that the Fresnel coeﬃcients and therefore

the nature of the material play a crucial role in this modiﬁcation. For example, as pointed out

by Agarwal25, in the case of a perfectly conducting surface, the contribution of the electric

and magnetic LDOS vanish, except for their free-space contribution. In this particular case,

one also retrieves the vacuum result.

We now focus our attention to real materials like metals and dielectrics. We ﬁrst calculate

ρ(ω) for aluminum at diﬀerent heights. Aluminum is a metal whose dielectric constant is

well described by a Drude model for near-UV, visible and near-IR frequencies27:

with ωp = 1.747 1016 rad.s−1 and γ = 7.596 1013 rad.s−1. We plotted in Fig.1 the LDOS

ρ(r, ω) in the near UV-near IR frequency domain at four diﬀerent heights. We ﬁrst note that

the LDOS increases drastically when the distance to the material is reduced. As discussed

in the previous paragraph, at large distance from the material, one retrieves the vacuum

density of states. Note that at a given distance, it is always possible to ﬁnd a suﬃciently high

frequency for which the corresponding wavelength is small compared to the distance so that

a far-ﬁeld situation is retrieved. When the distance to the material is reduced, additional

modes are present: these are the evanescent modes that are conﬁned close to the interface

and that cannot be seen in the far ﬁeld. Moreover, aluminum exhibits a resonance around

ω = ωp/√2. Below this frequency, the material supports resonant surface waves (surface-

plasmon polaritons). Additional modes are therefore seen in the near ﬁeld. This produces an

increase of the LDOS close to the interface. The enhancement is particularly important at

1. This behavior is analogous to

that previously described in Ref.24 for a SiC surface supporting surface-phonon polaritons.

−

Also note that in the low frequency regime, the LDOS increases. Finally, Fig.1 shows that

it is possible to have a LDOS smaller than that of vacuum at some particular distances

and frequencies. Figure 2 shows the propagating and evanescent waves contributions to the

LDOS above an aluminum sample at a distance of 10 nm. The propagating contribution

is very similar to that of the vacuum LDOS. As expected, the evanescent contribution

dominates at low-frequency and around the surface-plasmon polariton resonance), where

pure near-ﬁeld contributions dominates.

We now turn to the comparison of ρ(z, ω) with the usual deﬁnition often encountered

in the literature, which corresponds to ρE(z, ω). We plot in Fig.3 ρ, ρE and ρH above an

aluminum surface at a distance z = 10nm. In this ﬁgure, it is possible to identify three

diﬀerent domains for the LDOS behaviour. We note again that in the far-ﬁeld situation

(corresponding here to high frequencies i.e. λ/2π

z), the LDOS reduces to the vacuum

situation. In this case ρ(z, ω) = 2ρE(z, ω) = 2ρH(z, ω). Around the resonance, the LDOS is

≪

dominated by the electric-ﬁeld Green contribution. Conversely, at low frequencies, ρH (z, ω)

dominates. Thus, Fig.3 shows that we have to be very careful when using the expression

ρ(z) = ρE(z, ω). Above aluminum and at a distance z = 10nm, this approximation is only

C. Asymptotic form of the LDOS in the near-ﬁeld

In order to get more physical insight, we have calculated the asymptotic LDOS behaviour

in the three regimes mentioned above. As we have already seen, the far-ﬁeld regime (λ/2π

≪
d) corresponds to the vacuum case. To study the near-ﬁeld situation, we focus on the

evanescent contribution as suggested by the results in Fig.2. When λ = 2πc/ω

At a distance z = 10nm above an aluminum surface, these asymptotic expressions matches

almost perfectly with the full evanescent contributions (κ > 1) of ρE and ρH . These expres-

sions also show that for a given frequency, one can always ﬁnd a distance to the interface z

below which the dominant contribution to the LDOS will be the one due to the imaginary

part of the electric-ﬁeld Green function that varies like (k0z)−3. But for aluminum at a

distance z = 10nm, this is not the case for all frequencies. As we mentionned before, this

is only true around the resonance. For example for low frequencies, and for z = 10nm, the

LDOS is actually dominated by ρvǫ

/(16k0z).

′′

D. Spatial oscillations of the LDOS

Let us now focus on the LDOS variations at a given frequency versus the distance z to the

interface. There are essentially three regimes. First, for as discussed previously, at distances

much larger than the wavelength the LDOS is given by the vacuum expression ρv. The

second regime is observed close to the interface where oscillations are observed. Indeed, at

a given frequency, each incident plane wave on the interface can interfere with its reﬂected

counterpart. This generate an interference pattern with a fringe spacing that depends on the

angle and the frequency. Upon adding the contributions of all the plane waves over angles,

the oscillating structure disappears except close to the interface. This leads to oscillations

around distances on the order of the wavelength. This phenomenon is the electromagnetic

analog of Friedel oscillations that can be observed in the electronic density of states near the

interfaces7,28. As soon as the distance becomes small compared to the wavelength, the phase

factors exp(2ipωz/c) in Eq. (13) are equal to unity. For a highly reﬂecting material, the real

part of the reﬂecting coeﬃcients are negative so that the LDOS decreases while approaching

the surface. These two regimes are clearly observed for aluminum in Fig. 4. The third regime

is observed at small distances as seen in Fig. 4. The evanescent contribution dominates and

ultimately the LDOS always increases as 1/z3, following the behaviour found in Eq. (17).

This is the usual quasi-static contribution that is always found at short distance26. At a

frequency slightly smaller than the resonant frequency, surface waves are excited on the

surface. These additional modes increase the LDOS according to an exponential law as

seen in Fig. 5, a behavior which was already found for thermally emitted ﬁelds5,26. At low

frequency, the LDOS dependance is given by Eq.(18). The 1/z magnetic term dominates

because the 1/

ǫ + 1

2 takes large values. The 1/z3 contribution equals the 1/z contribution

The main results of this section can be summarized as follows. The LDOS of the electro-

magnetic ﬁeld can be unambiguously and properly deﬁned from the local density of electro-

magnetic energy in a vacuum above a sample at temperature T in equilibrium. The LDOS

can always be written as a function of the electric-ﬁeld Green function only, but is in general

not proportionnal to the trace of its imaginary part. An additional term proportional to the

1. Close to this resonance, the approximation ρ(z, ω) = ρE(z, ω) holds.

−

In the next section, we discuss how the LDOS can be measured.

IV. MEASUREMENT OF THE LDOS

A. Near-ﬁeld thermal emission spectroscopy with an apertureless SNOM

In this section we shall consider how the LDOS can be measured using a SNOM. We con-

sider a frequency range where ρ is dominated by the electric contribution ρE. We note that

for an isotropic dipole, a lifetime measurement yields the LDOS as discussed by Wijnands

et al.10. However, if the dipole has a ﬁxed orientation x, the lifetime is proportionnal to Gxx

and not to the trace of

↔
G. In order to achieve a direct SNOM measurement of the LDOS, we

have to fulﬁll two requirements. First, all the modes must be excited. The simplest way to

achieve this is to use the thermally emitted radiation by a body at equilibrium. The second

requirement is to have a detector with a ﬂat response to all modes. To analyse this problem

we use a formalism recently introduced.

12

We consider a SNOM working in the detection mode, and detecting the electromagnetic

ﬁeld thermally emitted by a sample held at a temperature T . The system is depicted in

Fig. 6. The microscope tip is scanned at close proximity of the interface separating the solid

body from a vacuum. The signal is measured in the far ﬁeld, by a point detector sensitive to

the energy ﬂux carried by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We assume that an analyzer is placed

in front of the detector (polarized detection). The direction of polarization of the analyzer

is along the direction of the vector jrec. If the solid angle dΩ under which the detector is

seen from the tip is small (a condition we assume for simplicity), the signal

S(ω)

at the

detector, at a given frequency ω, reads

h

i

(19)

S(ω)

=

h

i

ǫ0c

Ed( ω)

2r2dΩ

|

where ǫ0 is the permittivity of vacuum, c is the speed of light in vacuum, r is the distance

between the tip and the detector, and Ed is the electric ﬁeld at the position of the detector.

Let us denote by Eexp (experimental ﬁeld) the thermal ﬁeld, emitted by the sample, in

the gap region between the tip and the sample. This ﬁeld can be, in principle, calculated

following the approach recently used in5,24. For simplicity, we shall neglect the thermal

emission from the tip itself (which is assumed to be cold) compared to that of the heated

sample. But we do not need, at this stage, to assume a weak coupling between the tip and the

sample. In particular, in the expressions derived in this section, the experimental ﬁeld Eexp

is the ﬁeld emitted by the sample alone, in the presence of the detecting tip. Following the

approach of29, based on the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism30, an exact relationship

between the signal

S(ω)

and the experimental ﬁeld Eexp can be established. It can be shown

i
that the signal is given by an overlapping integral.

h

To proceed, one considers a ﬁctitious situation in which the sample is removed, and a

point source, represented by a monochromatic current jrec oscillating at frequency ω, is

placed at the position of the detector (see Fig. 6(b)). The orientation of this reciprocal

source is chosen along the direction of polarization of the analyzer used in the experimental

situation. The ﬁeld created around the tip in this reciprocal situation is denoted by Erec.

Using the reciprocity theorem, the ﬁeld at the detector can be written29:

Ed(ω)

jrec = −

·

2i
µ0ω ZS

∂Erec(R, z, ω)
∂z

·

Eexp(R, z, ω)dR

(20)

where the integration is performed in a plane z = z0 between the tip and the sample and

R = (x, y) are the coordinates along this plane. Equation (20) connects the ﬁeld above the

13

surface Eexp to the ﬁeld in the detector Ed along the direction of the analyzer. Note that

the reciprocal ﬁeld Erec encodes all the information about the detection system (tip and

collection optics). Reporting the expression of the ﬁeld at the detector (20) in (19), one

ﬁnds the expression for the measured signal:

S(ω)

=

h

i

ǫ0c
8π2

ZSZS

Hij(R, R′, z, ω)Wij(R, R′, z, ω)dRdR′ .

(21)

Equation (21) establishes a linear relationship between the signal and the cross-spectral

density tensor Wij of the electric ﬁeld deﬁned by

Eexp,i(R, z, ω)E∗

exp,j(R′, z, ω′)

= Wij(R, R′, z, ω) δ(ω

ω′) .

(22)

i

−

h

The response function Hij only depends on the detection system (in particular the tip

geometry and composition), and is given by

Hij(R, R′, ω) =

∂Erec,i(R, z, ω)
∂z

∂Erec,j(R′, z, ω)
∂z

.

(23)

The cross-spectral density tensor Wij describes the electric-ﬁeld spatial correlation at a

given frequency ω. For the thermal emission situation considered here, it depends only on

the dielectric constant, on the geometry and on the temperature of the sample.

Equation (21) is a general relationship between the signal and the cross-spectral density

tensor. It is non-local and strongly polarization dependent. This shows that one do not

measure in general a quantity which is proportional to Wkk(r, r, ω), and thus to ρE(r, ω).
Nevertheless Eq. (21) suggested that ρE(r, ω) can be recovered if the response function Hij is
localized. Indeed, in that case the signal is proportional to Wij(R, R, z, ω), thus to ρE(r, ω).

As shown in the next section, a dipole tip (small sphere) would exhibit such a response

function.

B. Detection of the LDOS by an ideal point-dipole probe

Let us see what would be measured by an ideal probe consisting of a single electric

dipole described by a polarizability α(ω). Note that such a probe was proposed as a model

for the uncoated dielectric probe sometimes used in photon scanning tunneling microscopy

(PSTM), and gives good qualitative prediction31. We assume that the thermally emitting

medium occupies the half-space z < 0, and that the probe is placed at a point rt. As in the

14

preceding section, the detector placed in the far ﬁeld measures the ﬁeld intensity at a given

point rd, through an analyser whose polarization direction is along the vector jrec. In this

case, Eq. (20) simpliﬁes to read

Equation (25) shows that with an ideal probe consisting of a signal dipole (with an

isotropic polarizability α(ω), one locally measures the cross-spectral density tensor at the

position rt of the tip. Nevertheless, polarization properties of the detection still exists so
that the trace of Wij, and therefore ρE(r, ω), is not directly measured. A possibility of

measuring the trace would be to measure a signal

a natural way to achieve the measurement of ρE(r, ω). Close to the material resonances, i.e

in the frequency domain where ρE(r, ω) matches ρ(r, ω), such a near-ﬁeld thermal emission

spectrum gives the electromagnetic LDOS.

15

C. Analogy with scanning (electron) tunneling microscopy

The result in this section shows that a SNOM measuring the thermally emitted ﬁeld

with a dipole probe (for example a sphere much smaller than the existing wavelengths)

measures the electromagnetic LDOS of the sample in the frequency range situated around

the resonant pulsation. As discussed above, the measured LDOS is that of the modes which

can be excited in the thermal emission process in a cold vacuum. This result was obtained

from Eq. (20) assuming a weak tip-sample coupling, i.e., the experimental ﬁeld is assumed

to be the same with or without the tip.

The same result could be obtained starting from the generalized Bardeen formula derived

in ref.11. Using this formalism for a dipole probe, one also ends up with Eq. (25), which

explicitly shows the linear relationship between the signal and ρE(r, ω). This derivation

is exactly the same as that used in the Tersoﬀ and Haman theory of the STM8. This

theory showed, in the weak tip-sample coupling limit, that the electron-tunneling current

measured in STM was proportional to the electronic LDOS of the sample, at the tip position,

and at the Fermi energy. This result, although obtained under some approximations, was

a breakthrough in understanding the STM signal.

In the case of near-ﬁeld optics, the

present discussion, together with the use of the generalized Bardeen formula11, shows that

under similar approximations, a SNOM using an ideal dipole probe and measuring the ﬁeld

thermally emitted by the sample is the real optical analog to the electron STM. We believe

that this situation provides for SNOM a great potential for local solid-surface spectroscopy,

along the directions opened by STM.

D. Could the LDOS be detected by standard SNOM techniques ?

Before concluding, we will discuss the ability of standard SNOM techniques (by “stan-

dard” we mean techniques using laser-light illumination) to image the electromagnetic LDOS

close to a sample. Recent experiments23 have shown that an illumination-mode SNOM using

metal-coated tips and working in transmission produce images which reproduce calculated

maps of ρE(r, ω) (which is the adopted deﬁnition of the LDOS in this experimental work,

see also22). We shall now show that this operating mode bear strong similarites to that

corresponding to a SNOM working in collection mode, and measuring thermally emitted

16

ﬁelds. This will explain why the images reproduce (at least qualitatively) the electric LDOS

ρE(r, ω).

Let us ﬁrst consider a collection-mode technique, in which the sample (assumed to be

transparent) is illuminated in transmission by a monochromatic laser with frequency ω, and

the near-ﬁeld light is collected by a local probe. If we assume the illuminating light to be

spatially incoherent and isotropic in the lower half-space (with all incident directions in-

cluded), then this illumination is similar to that produced by thermal ﬂuctuations (except

that only the modes corresponding to the frequency ω are actually excited). Note that this

mode of illumination corresponds to that proposed in Ref.33. This similarity, together with

the discussion in the precedding paragraph, allows to conclude that under these operat-

ing conditions, a collection-mode SNOM would produce images which closely resemble the

electric LDOS ρE(r, ω).

We now turn to the discussion of images produced using an illumination-mode SNOM, as

that used in Ref.23. The use of the reciprocity theorem allows to derive an equivalence be-

tween illumination and collection-mode conﬁgurations, as shown in Ref.34. Starting from the

collection-mode instrument described above, the reciprocal illumination-mode conﬁguration

corresponds to a SNOM working in transmission, the light being collected by an integrating

sphere over all possible transmission directions (including those below and above the critical

angle). Under such conditions, the illumination-mode SNOM produces exactly the same im-

age as the collection-mode SNOM using isotropic, spatially incoherent and monochromatic

illumination. This explains why this instrument is able to produce images which closely fol-

low the electric LDOS ρE(r, ω). Finally, note that in Ref.23, the transmitted light is collected

above the critical angle only, which in principle should be a drawback regarding the LDOS

imaging. In these experiments, it seems that the interpretation of the images as maps of

the electric LDOS remains nevertheless qualitatively correct, which shows that in this case,

the main contribution to the LDOS comes from modes with wavevector corresponding to

propagation directions above the critical angle.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have introduced a deﬁntion of the electromagnetic LDOS ρ(r, ω). We

have shown that it is fully determined by the electric-ﬁeld Green function, but that in general

17

it does not reduce to the trace of its imaginary part ρE(r, ω). We have studied the LDOS

variations versus the distance to a material surface and have explicitly shown examples

in which the LDOS deviates from ρE(r, ω). Nevertheless, we have shown that around the

material resonances (surface polaritons), the near-ﬁeld LDOS reduces to ρE(r, ω). Measuring

the LDOS with an apertureless SNOM using a point-dipole tip should be feasible. The

principle of the measurement is to record a near-ﬁeld thermal emission spectrum. Under such

condition, the instrument behaves as the optical analog of the STM, in the weak-coupling

regime, which is known to measure the electronic LDOS on a metal surface. Finallly, we have

discussed recent standard SNOM experiments in which the LDOS seems to be qualitatively

measured. Using general arguments, we have discussed the relevance of such measurements

and compared them to measurements based on thermal-emission spectroscopy.

APPENDIX A: CALCULATION OF THE FIELD AT THE DETECTOR FOR AN

IDEAL POINT-DIPOLE PROBE

Let erec(K) and eexp(K) be the bidimensional Fourier component of Erec(r) and Eexp(r).

whereas the experimental ﬁelds propagates to the positive z. Thus

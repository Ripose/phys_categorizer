We report on the operation of a 50 mW continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL) in the
9.2 µm range, phase locked to a single mode CO2 laser with a tunable frequency oﬀset. The wide
free-running emission spectrum of the QCL (3-5 MHz) is strongly narrowed down to the kHz range
making it suitable for high resolution molecular spectroscopy.

PACS numbers: 42.60.By,42.62.Eh,42.55.Px

Continuous wave high power (≥50 mW) quantum cas-
cade laser sources (QCL) recently became commercially
available [1]. They exhibit new features for infrared laser
spectroscopy. Mid-IR QCLs are easily and widely tun-
able over more than 200 GHz by adjusting their tem-
perature or injection current. Since they do not present
phase-amplitude coupling, their ultimate linewidth is ex-
pected to be very narrow. In practice, due to thermal
instabilities, they present a wide free-running emission
spectrum, in the MHz range [2, 3]. Several experiments
have shown a signiﬁcant reduction of the QCL linewidth
down to the 10 kHz range by injection current locking to a
molecular line [4], or well below the kHz range by locking
to a Fabry Perot cavity [5] using the Pound-Drever-Hall
technique.

Phase-locking is a well-known technique used to reduce
the relative phase noise between two laser oscillators or to
transfer the spectral features of a stable laser to a noisy
one [6]. This method consists in comparing the phase of
the laser beat note with that of a RF synthesizer signal.
It has recently been applied to the frequency control of
terahertz QCLs [7], but never so far to infrared QCL
linewidth reduction.

Our motivation for developping a frequency controlled
QCL source is high resolution vibrational spectroscopy
of the hydrogen molecular ions H+
Indeed,
those ions have recently been pointed out as good can-
didates for optical proton to electron mass ratio deter-
mination [8, 9, 10, 11]. Recent calculations have shown
that two-photon vibrational spectroscopy of H+
2 in the
9.1-9.3 µm range is feasible [8] with interaction times of
a few tens of ms. Transitions frequencies have been pre-
dicted with 1 ppb relative accuracy. Further progress in
QED correction calculations should allow proton to elec-
tron mass ratio determination with a relative accuracy of
10−10, in signiﬁcant progress over the present one (CO-
DATA 2002) [14]. This corresponds to an uncertainty of
a few kHz on the transition frequencies, hence the need
for a kHz linewidth laser source.

In the 9.1-9.3 µm wavelength range, only two kinds of
cw laser sources are available : CO2 lasers and QCLs.
Single mode CO2 lasers can deliver up to several watt of
optical power in a narrow bandwidth of less than 1 kHz.
Unfortunately, their tunability covers a range of a few
tens of MHz and the CO2 emission lines do not over-
lap with the H+
2 spectrum. In this paper, we show that
it is possible to combine the advantages of both kinds
of sources by transferring the spectral properties of a
CO2 laser to a widely tunable QCL using phase-lock
loop techniques. We demonstrate the operation of a tun-
able narrow-line high-power laser source suitable for two-
photon spectroscopy of hydrogen molecular ions with a
kHz resolution.

Power output

FIG. 1: Simpliﬁed experimental setup. The low power CO2
laser output (≈50 mW) is beated with a fraction of the QCL
emission (≈10 mW). The frequency divider and phase com-
parator are described in text, and the servo circuit in Fig. 2.

The experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 1. The
quantum cascade laser (SBCW496DN from AlpesLaser)
is a single mode distributed feedback laser. When oper-
ated in cw regime under cryogenic conditions, it delivers
up to 160 mW and is tunable between 9.16 and 9.24 µm
(32.44 and 32.73 THz). Its threshold current is 400 mA
at 77 K, and its maximum driving current is 1 A. The

temperature and current tunabilities are 3 GHz/K and
150 MHz/mA.

The QCL is mounted in a liquid nitrogen cryostat with
a ZnSe output window and driven by a home-made, low-
noise stabilized current source. The voltage across the
QCL is about 9 V and the dynamic resistance is 1.8 Ω.
The electrical power dissipated in the QCL can be as high
as 9 W, which requires eﬃcient heat dissipation. For this
purpose, the laser chip is ﬁxed on a monolithic copper
post, screwed on the cryostat cold plate in order to min-
imize the thermal resistance. The post can be heated
and temperature controlled at the 10 mK level. With
a 700 mA driving current, the QCL temperature stabi-
lizes around 80 K without external heating and the QCL
delivers an optical power of 50 mW at 9.166 µm, the re-
quired wavelength to probe the (v=0, L=2)→(v=1,L=2)
two-photon line in H+
2 .

The output beam is collimated using ZnSe collimating
optics from Cascade Technologies (CO-01, 0.85 mm N.A.
and 1.6 mm working distance). The far ﬁeld transverse
structure of the QCL beam presents a nodal structure
with one main and two secondary lobes along the vertical
axis. Along the horizontal axis, the Gaussian beam shape
dependence on propagation distance is consistent with a
M2 parameter of about 3.3.

We use the CO2 laser both as local oscillator to char-
acterize the QCL spectrum properties, and as stability
reference to phase lock the QCL. It is a sealed-oﬀ, low
pressure, dual-discharge-arm, 1 m long single longitudi-
nal mode laser. The cavity is closed by a Rmax mirror at
9.2 µm and a 150 lines/mm grating in the Littrow conﬁg-
uration. The grating zeroth diﬀraction order is the main
output of the laser (95% eﬃciency). When operated with
13 Torr of standard gas mixture (CO2-He-N2) and 24 mA
discharge current, the laser oscillation is obtained in the
9 µm band up to the 9R(48) line with more than 1 W of
optical power. The CO2 laser emission spectrum has a
linewidth in the kHz range [15] and only very slow drifts
(less than 1 MHz/s).

About 10 mW of QCL and 50 mW of CO2 laser opti-
cal powers are mixed on a room temperature HgCdZnTe
fast photodetector followed by a 37 dB low-noise RF am-
pliﬁer. Although the beams’ overlap is rather low, we
obtain a signal to noise ratio of more than 45 dB in a
1 MHz resolution bandwidth for a beat frequency f0 up
to 1.5 GHz. The free-running QCL emission spectrum
(Fig. 3a) is about 3 to 5 MHz wide as already observed
with other QCLs [2, 3] and exhibits a low frequency jitter
over more than 10 MHz.

In order to eﬃciently phase lock the QCL on the CO2
laser, we tailor a wideband phase error signal and use a
standard second order feedback loop [6, 16, 17]. The opti-
cal and electronic paths are shortened as much as possible
(about 2 m) to minimize time delay. The beat note sig-
nal is high-pass ﬁltered above 700 MHz and divided by
8 using a MC12093 high speed frequency divider. The
phase comparison with a synthesized reference signal is
performed at f0/8 using a MCH12140 phase/frequency

2

detector with a ±2π range. As a result, we obtain a very
wide band (≥10 MHz) ±16π phase/frequency compari-
son of the two lasers’ spectra. The measured slope of the
error signal is s = 0 · 022 V/rad.

The servo loop is depicted in Fig 2. It simply consists
in an integrator with a 600 kHz cut-oﬀ frequency built
with a fast operational ampliﬁer. The feedback loop gain
is adjusted using a variable resistor. The correction signal
is directly applied to the QCL through a ≈1kΩ resistor
that limits the output current from the ampliﬁer. This
resistor is split into two parts. The ﬁrst one belongs to a
phase advanced ﬁlter with 2.4 MHz cut-oﬀ frequency ad-
justed to optimize the loop bandwidth. The second part
is directly soldered on the QCL pads inside the cryostat
in order to minimize wire capacitance eﬀects. Because
we use a phase-frequency detector, we have to choose
the suitable sign for the correction signal depending on
whether the QCL frequency is red or blue detuned with
respect to the CO2 laser frequency. This is the aim of
the second inversor follower ampliﬁer.

FIG. 2: Servo electronics of the phase lock loop. The resistor
values are in Ω.

The beat note spectrum, taken with the tracking servo
active, is shown in Fig. 3b.
It represents the relative
phase noise spectral density between the QCL and CO2
laser. It exhibits an extremely narrow central peak with
a -3 dB width of less than 200 Hz, limited by the res-
olution of the spectrum analyzer. This width is much
smaller than the CO2 laser one, meaning that the CO2
laser’s spectral features are transferred to the QCL. The
spectrum’s wings show a servo-loop unity gain frequency
of the order of 6 MHz with a carrier 53 dB above the
phase noise level in a 10 kHz resolution bandwidth. We
now estimate the energy concentration ratio in the cen-
tral peak. The normalized beat note spectrum can be
expressed as [17]

S(f ) ≈ e

2

−σ

ϕ δ(f ) + Sϕ(f )

(1)

where σϕ is the phase error variance, δ(f ) the Dirac
delta-function and Sϕ the phase noise spectral density.
We have Sϕ(f ) ≈ 10−9.3 ≈ 5 · 10−10rad2/Hz. Graph-
ical integration within the loop bandwidth gives an es-
timation of half the actual phase variance, i.e.
ϕ =
3 10−3 rad2 [16, 17]. Fig. 4 shows the phase error
spectral density at the output of the phase comparator.
Comparison of curves (b) and (c) shows that the inte-
grator reduces phase noise by more than 10 dB up to

200 kHz. The phase noise error signal spectral density
exhibits a plateau at the Su=10−12.4 V2/Hz level corre-
sponding to a phase noise spectral density Sϕ = Su/s2 =
8 · 2 10−10 rad2/Hz. Taking into account the 6 MHz
noise bandwidth, we obtain an alternative estimation of
the phase variance 1
ϕ = 0 · 005 rad2 in good agree-
ment we the ﬁrst one. From those values, we can deduce
that the energy concentration ratio in the narrow cen-
tral peak e−σ
ϕ is higher than 99%. Let us stress that
the large feedback loop bandwidth is essential to obtain
this result [18]. The phase locked operation of the QCL

2 σ2

is easily obtained with a tunable frequency oﬀset in the
200-1500 MHz range around the CO2 emission line. The
high frequency limit is due to the detector cut-oﬀ. The
low frequency limit is the minimum beat frequency nec-
essary to obtain a wide band error signal after division
and phase comparison. It can be overcome by frequency
shifting the high power output of the CO2 laser with an
acousto-optic modulator before beating with the QCL.
Stable operation of the lock during several hours is ob-
tained.

In conclusion, we have shown that the spectral features
of CO2 lasers can be transferred to a QCL with a tunable
frequency oﬀset, making QCLs very interesting tools for
high resolution molecular spectroscopy. We have used
this source to observe several absorption lines of the ν6
band of formic acid [19] in quasi-coincidence with the
9R36 to 9R42 emission lines of the CO2 laser with a kHz
resolution and measured their absolute frequencies [20]
to obtain suitable molecular frequency references for H+

vibrational spectroscopy.

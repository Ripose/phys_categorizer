Abstract. We demonstrate generation and frequency doubling of unit charge vortices
in a linear astigmatic resonator. Topological instability of the double charge harmonic
vortices leads to well separated vortex cores that are shown to rotate, and become
anisotropic, as the resonator is tuned across resonance.

Creation, doubling, and splitting, of vortices in intracavity second harmonic generation2

Optical vortices are topological objects whose transformation properties under
propagation in linear and nonlinear optical media have been the subject of much recent
work[1]. The vortex charge of a beam, deﬁned as the closed loop contour integral of
the wave phase modulo 2π, is generally a conserved quantity under linear propagation
in free space. Optical vortices occur naturally in speckle ﬁelds[2], and can be generated
in a controlled fashion using diﬀraction from holographic plates[3, 4]. They can also
be generated in lasers[5, 6] and cavities with nonlinear elements[7], while high order
vortex modes have been observed in active cavities with ﬁeld rotating elements[8, 9].
Astigmatic optical elements as well as nonlinear wave interactions can be used to change
the vortex charge of a beam. For example in the weak pump depletion regime of
second harmonic generation the amplitude of the envelope of the harmonic ﬁeld at
frequency ω2 can be written as A2 ∼ A2
1. Thus an input ﬁeld with charge m of the form
A1 ∼ eımφ generates an output ﬁeld A2 ∼ eı2mφ with twice the charge. This eﬀect has
been demonstrated experimentally by several groups using optical vortices created by
diﬀraction from a hologram, and then allowing the beam to pass through a frequency
doubling crystal[10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

In this work we describe a diﬀerent approach to the generation of vortices in second
harmonic generation that is based on frequency doubling of resonator modes with a
vortical structure. Consider an empty resonator with the pump beam mode matched to
the lowest order transverse resonator mode (TEM00 mode), which has a slowly varying
amplitude at the cavity waist given by u00 ∼ exp(−r2/w2
c ), with ~r = xˆx + y ˆy and wc
the cavity waist. By changing the cavity tuning, and slightly tilting and displacing
the pump beam, we can couple to higher order transverse modes of the cavity. By
appropriate alignment of the pump beam it is possible to couple to a single higher order
transverse mode, such as u10 ∼ x exp(−r2/w2
c ) which have edge
dislocations. Following the cavity by an astigmatic mode-converter[15] the Hermite-
Gauss modes can be eﬃciently converted into azimuthally symmetric Laguerre-Gauss
modes with non-zero vortex charge, as was demonstrated by Snadden et al.[16].

c ) or u01 ∼ y exp(−r2/w2

As we show here it is also possible to generate a vortex mode directly, without
using an astigmatic mode converter, by aligning the pump beam to give the desired
superposition of u10 and u01 modes. Let the pump beam be a displaced and tilted

we have up = exp (−|~r − ~rp|2/w2
p) exp (i~q · ~r). Here wp is the pump beam waist, ~rp =
xp ˆx + yp ˆy is the transverse displacement of the pump beam, and ~q = qx ˆx + qy ˆy is the
transverse wavevector that is proportional to the pump beam tilt in the x, y plane. The
lowest order odd cavity mode that the pump couples to can be written as

u = o10a(ν − ν10)u10 + o01a(ν − ν01)u01

pumn is an overlap integral, and a(ν − νmn) is a complex
coeﬃcient that depends on the diﬀerence between the pump frequency ν and the
resonant frequency of the mode νmn. The amplitude and phase of the overlap coeﬃcients
can be independently varied by adjusting the pump beam[17]. Performing the integrals

we ﬁnd o10 = h(2xp/wp−ikxwp) and o01 = h(2yp/wp −ikywp), where h is an unimportant
common factor. By adjusting the pump beam we can obtain o01 = o10 exp (iπ/2) which
results in vortex generation when a(ν − ν10) = a(ν − ν01).

Vortices were generated in this way using the experimental setup shown in Fig. 1.
A Ti:Sapphire laser at 858 nm generates a continuous wave fundamental beam with a
power of up to 300 mW incident on the freqency doubling cavity. The beam is mode
matched to a linear cavity with two R = 25 mm end mirrors that contains a 1 cm long
a-cut KNbO3 crystal with anti-reﬂection coated ends. The input and output mirrors
had T858nm = 4.8%, 0.04% and T429nm = 92% so that only the fundamental ﬁeld was
resonant in the cavity. Phase matching was controlled by varying the temperature of the
crystal. With the distance between the mirrors set to Lcf = R + nc−1
nc Lc = 30.7 mm for
confocal operation (nc, Lc are the crystal refractive index and length), and the crystal
temperature tuned for large phase mismatch so no harmonic beam was generated, a
cavity ﬁnesse of about 80 was measured. This agrees well with the theoretical value
of F = 84 that was calculated using measured values of the crystal losses. With the
crystal temperature tuned for optimum phase matching up to about 60 mW of 429 nm
light was generated in a TEM00 mode.

The cavity length was then reduced by 1.63 mm which resulted in the appearance
of higher order transverse modes in the cavity transmission spectrum as seen in Fig.
2. Using the measured free spectral range as a scaling parameter the theoretically
calculated frequencies of the ﬁrst few higher order (q, m, n) modes have been indicated
in the ﬁgure. The observed resonance frequencies agree to within a few percent with the
calculated values. The cavity was locked to a (q, 1, 0) resonance using the rf sideband
technique[19] which resulted in stable generation of a unit charge vortex mode as seen

The phase structure of the harmonic ﬁeld was observed by interference with a
TEM00 beam generated in a second doubling cavity. As expected the second harmonic
beam contained a doubly charged vortex as seen in Fig. 3. The detailed structure of
the beam had a sensitive dependance on resonator alignment. Careful alignment of the
crystal position resulted in observation of a doubly charged core region, although there
was an apparent tendency for the vortices to repel each other so that a small vortex
separation remained as seen in Fig. 3. We attribute the splitting to the topological
instability of m > 1 vortices[18]. Adjustments to the crystal and/or pump beam
alignment resulted in the core splitting into two well separated singly charged vortices,
with a controllable relative orientation and separation.
It was also found that when
the resonator was aligned so that the cores were well separated, the relative orientation
angle of the cores rotated in a repeatable fashion as the resonator was tuned across the
(q, 1, 0) resonance, as seen in Fig. 4.

The observations of vortex rotation can be explained by taking account of the
cavity astigmatism due to crystal birefringence. Let the fundamental beam propagate
along z (a-axis of KNbO3) and be polarized along y (b-axis). Beams propagating in
the x − z plane correspond to ordinary polarized rays with an index nb = 2.279 at
858 nm and the temperature set for phase matching. We will label the x − z plane
modes with the ﬁrst transverse index m (the x axis is horizontal in the ﬁgures). Beams
propagating in the y − z plane correspond to extraordinary polarized rays with an index
n(θ) = nb(1 + tan2 θ)1/2/(1 + (nb/na)2 tan2 θ)1/2 where θ is the angle of the ray with
respect to the y axis and na = 2.238 We will label the y − z plane modes with the

second transverse index n. The eﬀective crystal thickness for x − z plane modes is Lc/nb
while the eﬀective thickness for y − z plane modes is Lc/˜n, where ˜n = n2
a/nb is the
eﬀective index[20]. Since ˜n < nb the crystal is eﬀectively longer in the y − z plane
and these modes have lower resonance frequencies. A short calculation shows that the
frequency splitting can be written as

from confocality. For our exprimental parameters the shift given by Eq. (2) is about
15 MHz, which is a non-negligible fraction of the cavity resonance which has a FWHM
of 2γ = 2π × 42 MHz. Indeed, close inspection of Fig. 2 reveals that the odd order
transverse modes are somewhat wider than the lowest order modes, in agreement with
Eq. (2). The modal coeﬃcient a that appears in Eq. (1) can be written as

where χmn = f sin[π(ν − νmn)/(F γ)]/{1 − f cos[π(ν − νmn)/(F γ)]}, and f = 1 − π/F.
For our experimental parameters the relative phase shift when the resonator is tuned to
the midpoint between the (10) and (01) resonances is tan−1 χ10 − tan−1 χ01 ∼ 40◦.

The simulations of vortex rotation shown in Fig. 4 were obtained by calculating u
from Eq. (1), squaring the ﬁeld, and adding a small constant oﬀset which resulted in
splitting of the vortices. The phase diﬀerence between o10 and o01 was set to π/2−40◦ to
give the correct π/2 phase shift for ν at the midpoint between the modes, after which the
frequency ν was tuned across the resonance. We observe qualitative agreement between
the observed rotation, and the calculated results. The reason for the calculated rotation
being somewhat smaller than that observed may be that the calculations correspond
to the near ﬁeld while the observations shown in Fig. 4 were recorded in the far ﬁeld.
Additional observations revealed that the rotation angle was noticeably smaller in the
near than in the far ﬁeld. This is fully consistent with the propagation induced rotation
of a vortex pair[10]. It should be emphasized however that the observed dependence

of the rotation angle on the cavity tuning is not a propagation eﬀect, but rather due
to the interference of nondegenerate cavity modes with amplitudes given by Eq. (3).
We also note that the shape of the vortex cores becomes elliptical on either side of the
resonance. This may be due to the unequal changes in amplitude and phase of a which
implies that we are generating and doubling anisotropic vortices[21].

In conclusion we have observed creation, doubling, and splitting of vortices in a
second harmonic generating resonator. Tuning of the resonator across a pair of non-
degenerate transverse modes results in rotation of the harmonic vortex pattern.

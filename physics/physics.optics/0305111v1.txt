Eﬀects of boundary roughness on a Q-factor of whispering-gallery-mode lasing
microdisk cavities

We perform numerical studies of the eﬀect of sidewall imperfections on the resonant state broad-
ening of the optical microdisk cavities for lasing applications. We demonstrate that even small
edge roughness (. λ/30) causes a drastic degradation of high-Q whispering gallery (WG) mode
resonances reducing their Q-values by many orders of magnitude. At the same time, low-Q WG
resonances are rather insensitive to the surface roughness. The results of numerical simulation ob-
tained using the scattering matrix technique, are analyzed and explained in terms of wave reﬂection
at a curved dielectric interface combined with the examination of Poincar´e surface of sections in the
classical ray picture.

During recent years signiﬁcant experimental eﬀorts
were put forward towards investigation of laser emis-
sion of dielectric and polymeric low-threshold microdisk
cavities1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The high eﬃciency of lasing oper-
ation in such devices is related to the existence of natu-
ral cavity resonances known as whispering gallery (WG)
modes. The origin of these resonances can be envisioned
in a ray optic picture, wherein light is trapped inside the
cavity through total internal reﬂections on the cavity-air
boundary.

One of the most important characteristics of cavity
resonances is their quality factor (Q-factor) deﬁned as
Q = 2π∗(Stored energy)/(Energy lost per cycle). The
Q-factor of a microdisk cavity is mostly governed by a
radiative leakage through the curved interface due to
diﬀraction. An estimation of the Q-factor in an ideal
disk cavity of a typical diameter d ∼ 10µm for a typical
WG resonance gives Q ∼ 1013 (see below, Eq. (4)). At
the same time, experimental measured values reported
so far are typically in the range of 103 ∼ 104 or lower.
A reduction of a Q-factor may be attributed to a variety
of reasons including side wall geometrical imperfection,
inhomogeneity of the height and diﬀraction index of the
disk, eﬀects of coupling to the substrate or pedestal and
others. Several experimental studies point out side wall
imperfections as the main factor aﬀecting the Q-factor of
the cavity5,6,7. An indirect indication of the importance
of this factor in disc microcavities is provided by the ob-
servation that typical Q-factors of spheroidal microcavi-
ties are several orders of magnitude higher than those of
microdisk of comparable dimensions1,10. This is believed
to be due to superior quality of the microsphere surfaces
where boundary scattering may be limited by thermal
ﬂuctuations of the surface only. Therefore, the eﬀect of
surface roughness appears to be of crucial importance for
the design, tailoring and optimization of Q-values of las-
ing mikrodisk cavities. To the best of our knowledge, this
eﬀect has not been considered to date and warrants an
investigation.

In order to compute the resonant states of a cavity of
an arbitrary shape we develop a new approach based on
the scattering matrix technique. The scattering matrix

technique is widely used in analyse of waveguides11 as
well as in quantum mechanical simulations12. This tech-
nique was also used for an analysis of resonant cavities for
geometries when the analytical solution was available13.
Note that because the problem at hand requires a ﬁne dis-
cretization of the geometry, commonly used time-domain
ﬁnite diﬀerence methods14 would be prohibitively expen-
sive in terms of both computer power and memory. While
a detailed description of the calculations will be given
elsewhere, we present here the essence of the method.

We consider a two-dimensional cavity with the refrac-
tion index n surrounded by air. Because the majority
of experiments are performed only with the lowest trans-
verse mode occupied, we neglect the transverse (z-) de-
pendence of the ﬁeld and thus limit ourself to the two-
dimensional Helmholtz equation. We divide our system
in an outer and an inner regions. In the outer region the
refraction index n is independent of the coordinate and
the solution to the Helmholtz equation can be written in
polar coordinates in the form

We deﬁne the scattering matrix S in a standard
fashion11,12,13, B = SA, where A, B are column vectors
composed of the expansion coeﬃcients Aq, Bq for incom-
ing and outgoing states in Eq. (1). The matrix element
Sq′q gives the probability amplitude of scattering from
an incoming state q into an outgoing state q′. In order
to apply the scattering matrix technique we divide the
inner region into N narrow concentric rings. At each
i-th boundary between the rings we introduce the scat-
tering matrix Si that relates the states propagating (or
decaying) towards the boundary, with those propagating
(or decaying) away of the boundary. The matrices Si are
derived using the requirement of continuity of the tangen-
tial components for the E- and H-ﬁeld at the boundary

between the two dielectric media. Successively combin-
ing the scattering matrixes for all the boundaries11,12,
S1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ SN, we can relate the combined matrix to the
scattering matrix S.

To identify the resonant states of a resonant cav-
ity we introduce the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix
Q = i
c (dS†/dk) S,2,13,15 where the diagonal elements
Qqq give a time delay experienced by the wave inci-
dent in q-th channel and scattered into all other chan-
nels. The Q-value of the cavity is Q = ωτD(k), where
τD(k) is the total time delay averaged over all M incom-

FIG. 1: (a) Dependence of the quality factor Q = Q(λ) of
the circular disk for diﬀerent surface roughness ∆r indicated
in the ﬁgure; the disk radius is R = 5µm, the refraction in-
dex n = 1.8. The inset illustrates a cavity where the surface
roughness ∆r = 200nm and ∆l = 2πR/50 (the dotted line
represents an ideal circular boundary, the shaded region cor-
responds to the cavity). ρ characterizes the average radius of
local curvature due to boundary imperfections. TE modes of
the cavity exhibit similar features and are not shown here.

Figure 1 shows calculated Q-values of the disk resonant
cavity for diﬀerent surface roughnesses for TM modes in
some representative wavelength interval. Note that an
exact experimental shape of the cavity-surface interface
is not available. We thus model the interface shape as
a superposition of random Gaussian deviations from an
ideal circle of radius R with a maximal amplitude ∆r/2
and a characteristic distance between the deviation max-
ima ∆l ∼ 2πR/50 (see illustration in inset to Fig. 1).

The solid curve in Fig. 1 corresponds to an ideal disk
cavity without imperfections. Resonant states of an ideal
disk (as well as the bound states of the corresponding
closed resonator) are characterized by two numbers, q

(see Eq. (1) and m. The index m is a radial wave num-
ber that is related to the number of nodes of the ﬁeld
components in the radial direction r. The angular wave
number q can be related to the angle of incidence χ in a
classical ray picture2

q = nkR sin χ.

FIG. 2: Dependence Q on the surface roughness ∆r for sev-
eral representative resonances. (Each curve remains practi-
cally unchanged for diﬀerent realizations of surface rough-
ness). The inset shows the dependence of local radius of
roughness curvature ρ subject to ∆r. Parameters of the cavity
are the same as in Fig. 1.

The dependence of the averaged Q-values on the sur-
face roughness ∆r is summarized in Fig. 2 for several
representative resonances. A common feature of all high-
Q resonances is a dramatic decrease of their maximal Q-
value that takes place for very small values of ∆r . λ/20.
For example, a Q-value of at he resonant state TM83,1
drops from Q ≈ 1013 for an ideal disk to Q ≈ 103 for
surface roughness of only ∆r = 20nm. In contrast, low-
Q resonances show a rather slow decrease in their Q-
values over the range of variation of ∆r. For example,
for the same surface roughness ∆r = 20 the Q-value of
the resonant state TM56,7 decreases only by a factor of
1.5, dropping to Q ≈ 200.

In order to understand these features we combine a
Poincar´e surface of section (SoS) method with an anal-
ysis of ray reﬂection at a curved dielectric interface19.
The Q-value of the cavity can be related to the transmis-
sion probability T of an electromagnetic wave incident
on a curved interface of radius ρ by Q = 2nkρ cos χ/T 17
(this expression is valid for large angles of incidence χ
when T ≪ 1). In turn, for knρ ≫ 1, the transmission
probability reads19

Figure 3 illustrates that T decreases exponentially as the
diﬀerence χ − χc grows.

The inset to Fig. 3 depicts the Poincar´e SoS for two
states with q = 56 and 83 shown in Fig. 1, where the
initial angle of incidence χ0 of launched rays is related to
the angular number q by Eq. (3). The SoS demonstrates
that initially regular dynamics of an ideal cavity trans-
forms into a chaotic one even for a cavity with maximum
roughness ∆r . 20nm. ∆T 83,1
in Fig. 3 indicates the es-
ch
timated increase in the transmission coeﬃcient due to the
broadening of the phase space, ∆χch, as extracted from
the Poincar´e SoS for the state with q = 83. This cor-
responds to the decrease of ∆Q ∼ ∆T −1 ≈ 10−2. This
value is much smaller that the actual calculated decrease
of the Q-factor for the high-Q resonance TM83,1.

To explain the rapid degradation of high-Q resonances,
we concentrate on another aspect of the wave dynamics.
Namely, the imperfections at the surface boundary eﬀec-
tively introduce a local radius of surface curvature ρ that
is distinct from the disk radius R (see illustration in Fig.
1). One may thus expect that with the presence of a local
surface curvature, the total transmission coeﬃcient will
be determined by the averaged value of ρ rather than by
the disk radius R. The dependence of ρ on surface rough-
ness ∆r for the present model of surface imperfections is
shown in the inset to Fig. 2. Figure 3 demonstrates
that the reduction of the local radius of curvature from
5µm (ideal disk) to 1.7µm (∆r = 20nm) causes an in-
crease of the transmission coeﬃcient by ∆Tcur ≈ 108.
This estimate, combined with the estimate based on the
change of ∆Tch is fully consistent with the Q-factor de-
crease shown in Figs. 1,2. We thus conclude that the
main mechanism responsible for the rapid degradation of
high-Q resonances in non-ideal cavities is the enhanced
radiative decay through the curved surface because the
eﬀective local radius (given by the surface roughness) is
smaller that the disk radius R.

For the case of low-Q resonances the change in the
transmission coeﬃcient due to enhanced radiative decay
∆Tcur is of the same magnitude as the change ∆Tch due
to the broadening of the phase space caused by the tran-
sition to chaotic dynamics (as illustrated in Fig. 3 for
the resonance TM56,7). Therefore, both these factor play
comparable roles in degradation of the low-Q WG reso-
nances.

It is worth mentioning that one often assumes that

3

long-lived high-Q resonances in idealized cavities (e.g.
in ideal disks, hexagons, etc.) are not important for
potential application in optical communication or laser
devices13,18 because of their extremely narrow width.
Our simulations demonstrate that it is not the case, be-
cause in real structures the Q-values of these resonances
becomes comparable to those of intermediate-Q reso-
nances already for small or moderate surface roughness
of ∆r ∼ 10 − 50 nm.

To conclude, our results highlight the importance of
surface roughness for the performance of microcavities

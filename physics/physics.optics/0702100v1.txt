We introduce a novel approach to the problem of refraction of a light ray at an interface between
two homogeneous, isotropic and non-dispersive transparent optical materials in uniform rectilinear
motion. The approach is an amalgamate of the original Fermat’s principle and the fact that an
isotropic optical medium at rest becomes optically anisotropic in a frame where the medium is
moving at a constant velocity. We implemented the method to investigate the refraction at a
vacuum-material interface, when the optical material is moving: a) parallel to the interface; and b)
perpendicular to the interface. In each case, we give a detailed analysis of the obtained refraction
formula, and in the latter case, we notice and describe an an intriguing backward refraction of light.

INTRODUCTION

[21, 22, 23].

The variational approach in geometrical optics was es-
tablished in 1657 when the famous French mathemati-
cian Pierre de Fermat provided a mathematical proof
that the straight line is not the fastest way for light
to traverse between two optical media [1, 2, 3]. This
simple and new way of looking at the propagation of
light was allready empirically noticed by Hero of Alexan-
dria ﬁfteen centuries before Fermat by observing that
the path of the light between two points upon reﬂec-
tion from a plane mirror is the shortest possible path.
Fermat’s insightful and intriguing idea that “the Nature
always acts in the shortest ways” has inﬂuenced gen-
erations of scientists, like Maupertius, Euler, Lagrange,
Hamilton and Feynman, to successively translate classi-
cal and quantum physics into the language of variational
calculus [1, 4, 5, 6]. Today, the practical value of Fer-
mat’s principle is immense, ranging from applications in
geophysics, oceanography and material physics on one
side, to general relativity and astrophysics on the other
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

The modern formulation of Fermat’s principle states
that a light in going between two ﬁxed points traverses
an optical path length that is stationary with respect to
the variations of that path. In most cases, this formu-
lation reduces to the original one that the actual path
between the two points is the one which requires the
shortest time [20]. An accurate description of the pro-
cess beyond Fermat’s principle is provided by the modern
quantum electrodynamics, where the light is considered
to be made out of photons. Accordingly, the photon takes
all the available paths in going between two ﬁxed points,
each path at a certain probability, and the principle of
least time follows as an approximation of this argument

Fermat’s principle has been initially established for
optical systems whose properties are time-independent,
and, as such, has entered the mainstream of the standard
undergraduate physics curriculum through the deriva-
tions of the well-known laws of reﬂection and refraction of
light at a smooth stationary interface between two optical
materials at rest [21]. Recently, Fermat’s principle was
proven valid for optical systems with time-dependent pa-
rameters, including the situations when the optical media
and the boundaries between them are in uniform rectilin-
ear motion [24, 25, 26]. It was also shown that Einstein’s
law of reﬂection of light from a uniformly moving plane
mirror follows from Fermat’s principle and the constant
speed of light postulate, providing an indirect proof of
the validity of Fermat’s principle when the boundaries
upon which the light is reﬂected are moving at rela-
tivistic speeds [27]. Apart from the latter example, it
seems that the problems of light propagation involving
uniformly moving boundaries and media were never at-
tacked directly by using Fermat’s principle of least time.
Motivated by the latest extensions to non-stationary
cases, in this paper we will apply Fermat’s principle to
derive the formulas for refraction of a light ray in two spe-
ciﬁc situations when the boundaries and the media are
moving at constant velocities. We will limit our analy-
sis to optical media that are homogeneous, isotropic and
nonconducting in their rest frames of reference. Also, we
consider the media to be non-dispersive at rest, in the
sense that the correcting terms due to dispersion are so
small that can be neglected.

We begin our discussion in Sec.

II by showing that
an optical medium, isotropic in its rest frame, exhibits
an optical anisotropy with respect to the frame where
the medium is in uniform rectilinear motion. We derive
the expression for the speed of the photon in the moving
medium and show that it depends on the angle between
the light ray and the velocity of the medium. We de-
scribe this relativistically induced optical anisotropy in
a more convenient way, by introducing an eﬀective re-

fractive index of the moving medium, deﬁned as a ratio
between the speed of the photon in vacuum and the speed
of the photon in the moving medium. The notion that
the photon will “see” the moving medium as a station-
ary medium having an eﬀective refractive index diﬀerent
from its refractive index at rest, is incorporated into Fer-
mat’s principle in Sec. III and IV to investigate the re-
fraction of the photon incident from a vacuum half-space
upon a uniformly moving material half-space. In Sec. III
we investigate the situation when the material half-space
is moving parallel to the interface, and in Sec.
IV we
take the material half-space to move perpendicularly to
the interface.
In both cases, we consider the plane of
incidence to be normal to the vacuum-material interface
and parallel to the velocity of the medium.

II. AN OPTICAL ANISOTROPY OF A
TRANSPARENT MEDIUM INDUCED BY ITS
UNIFORM MOTION

If a ﬂash of light is emitted from a ﬁxed point source
in an empty space (a vacuum), the outgoing photons will
move radially on a spherical wavefront expanding at a
speed of light c. With respect to an observer from a
frame that moves in a straight line at a constant velocity,
the wavefront of the pulse will remain sphere, expanding
at the same constant speed c in all directions [28]. The
result is a corollary of the second postulate of special
relativity that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same
in all inertial frames of reference regardless of the motion
of the light source [29].

The situation is changed if the expansion of the pulse
is taking place in a material medium [30, 31]. If we con-
sider a homogeneous, isotropic and non-dispersive trans-
parent medium at rest with respect to S′-frame, and if we
treat the problem two-dimensionally, the equation that
describes the evolution of the pulse is:

x′2 + y′2 = (c/n)2t′2,

(1)

where n is the refractive index of the material at rest.
This is an equation of an expanding circle whose radius
at time t′ is (c/n)t′. By using the Lorentz transformation:

x′ = γ(x − ut), y′ = y, t′ = γ(t − ux/c2),

(2)

with γ = (1 − u2/c2)−1/2, we can make a transition to
S-frame where the medium is moving at a constant speed
u along the positive direction of the x-axis. In this way,
Eq. (1) is transformed into:

FIG. 1: An illustration of the light drag in the S-frame where
the medium is moving at a constant speed u (< c/n) in the
direction of the positive x-axis. The motion of the medium is
a cause for the wavefront of the pulse originating from O to be
a dragged ellipse possessing an axial symmetry with respect
to the x-axis. Hence, the photon emitted from O at an angle
ϕ will travel at a speed v(ϕ).

ray surface) with respect to an observer in S-frame is
an expanding ellipse “dragged” by the moving medium
(see Fig. 1). At time t from the emission of the pulse,
the product ηt is the dragging parameter, denoting the
distance from the origin O of the pulse (the origin of
the xy-coordinate system) to the center of the ellipse,
and the products at and bt are the semi-minor and semi-
major axes of the ellipse, respectively. Consequently, the
parameters a and b are the speeds of expansion of the
semi-minor and semi-major axes of the ellipse, and η is
the speed of the center of the ellipse along the x-axis.
When η < a, the ellipse will be incompletely “dragged”,
and the origin of the pulse will remain inside the ellipse
at all times. This is the case of a subluminal motion of
the medium, when the speed of the medium u is smaller
than c/n. On the other hand, when η ≥ a, the “drag-
ging” is overwhelming, and the ellipse no longer encloses
the origin. In this case the medium is moving at “super-
luminal” speeds (c/n < u < c), causing an existence of
a Mach cone, outside of which no light signal can ever
reach, and inside of which light is doubled up, with two

pulses of light in each direction [28, 30, 31].

We may translate Eq. (3) into the polar coordinates by

Here, v is the speed of the photon along a light ray di-
rected at an angle ϕ from the velocity of the medium
(see Fig. 1). Equation (7) is a quadratic in v, and it can
be solved for v in terms of the angle ϕ, the speed of the
medium u, and the refractive index n of the medium at
rest. By rejecting the second solution of Eq. (7) from
the requirement that v = c/n when u = 0, we obtain:

v(ϕ) =

(8)

From Eq. (8) we conclude that the ray velocity in the
moving medium depends on the angle ϕ between the di-
rection of the ray and the velocity of the medium. In this
sense, an optical medium that is optically isotropic in its
rest frame will possess an optical anisotropy in the frame
in which it is moving at a constant velocity. This induced
optical anisotropy is of a purely relativistic origin, and it
is diﬀerent from the usual anisotropy in the crystals [32].
The observer in the S-frame may track the path of a
light ray in the moving medium by considering it to be
a ”stationary” medium that possesses a relativistically
induced optical anisotropy characterized by an eﬀective
refractive index nef (ϕ):

nef (ϕ) =

c
v(ϕ)

.

(9)

Recalling Eq. (8) for v(ϕ), the expression for nef in Eq.
(9) can be re-written in terms of u, n and ϕ:

nef (ϕ) =

(u/c)(1 − n2) cos ϕ + n[1 − u2/c2]1/2

When n = 1, Eqs. (8) and (10) reduce to nef = 1 and
v = c for all ϕ, which describes an expansion of the pulse
in a vacuum. Also, when u = 0, we have nef = n and
v = c/n for all ϕ, which is the case when the medium is
stationary. If the photon moves parallel to the velocity
of the medium, nef ≈ n ± u/c and v ≈ c/n ± u(1 − 1/n2)
to the ﬁrst order in u/c, where the sign is taken “+” or

tively. This longitudinal light drag has been theoretically
predicted by Fresnel (1818) on the basis of his ether the-
ory, and experimentally conﬁrmed by Fizeau (1851) in
his celebrated running water experiment [30].

III. REFRACTION FROM A MATERIAL
HALF-SPACE MOVING PARALLEL TO THE
INTERFACE

A photon traveling in vacuum is incident upon the sur-
face of a semi-inﬁnite optical material which occupies the
positive region of the y-axis (see Fig. 2). The material
half-space is moving at a constant speed u in the positive
direction of the x-axis, parallel to the vacuum-material
interface. The material in its rest frame has a refractive
index n, and is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic
and non-dispersive. We will use Fermat’s principle to
derive the formula for the law of refraction of the photon
from the interface between the vacuum and the moving
medium.

Let A be the space-point in the vacuum half-space,
belonging to the incident ray of the photon, and B is
the space-point in the moving medium that lies on the
refracted ray. By dA and dB we denote the shortest dis-
tances between the interface and the points A and B,
respectively, and ℓ is the distance between the orthogo-
nal projections of the points A and B on the interface.
According to Fermat’s principle, the true path between
the two ﬁxed points A and B taken by the photon is the
one that is traversed in the least time. Of all the points
along the interface, the photon will be refracted at the

point O whose x-position minimizes the total time tAB
required for the photon to cover the path from A to B:

which we use into Eq. (17) to get:

tAB = tAO + tOB.

is the only one that is physically correct, which we choose
from the requirement that when u = 0 it should reduce
to the usual Snell’s law of refraction.

Equation (22) is the formula for the law of refraction
of the photon from the vacuum-material interface when
the optical material is moving uniformly parallel to its
surface. It gives the angle of refraction β of the photon
as a function of the incident angle α, the speed u of the
medium, and the refractive index n of the medium in its
rest frame.

The functional dependence of the angle of refraction β
on the incident angle α is plotted in Fig. 3 for n = 1.5 and
for several diﬀerent values of the speed u of the medium.
We immediately notice that the law of refraction in Eq.
(22) diﬀers considerably from the usual Snell’s law in the
case of a stationary medium. First of all, when u/c > 0,
the angle of refraction β attain non-zero values even when
the incident angle α is zero.
In other words, the pho-
ton that enters the moving medium perpendicularly to
its surface will be dragged by the medium in the mov-
ing direction. This is the transverse Fresnel-Fizeau light
drag, theoretically predicted by Fresnel in 1818 and ex-
perimentally detected by Jones in the early 1970s with
an accuracy up to the ﬁrst order of u/c [30, 33, 34, 35].
The inﬂuence of the dragging eﬀect on the refraction is
also visible for non-zero incident angles, especially when
they take negative values [36].
if
v/c > 0, starting from α = 0◦ down to a certain neg-
ative incident angle, the angle of refraction β is positive
(see Fig. 3), which means that both the incident and the
refracted ray of the photon will lie on the same side with
respect to the interface normal. Morever, when the speed

into account that v(ϕ) = c/nef (ϕ), and use Eqs. (12)
and (13), we may re-write the total transit time tAB in

FIG. 3: The angle of refraction β versus the incident angle
α for n = 1.5 and for diﬀerent speeds u of the material half-
space, when the material half-space is moving parallel to the
interface.

u of the medium becomes greater than c/n2, the angle
of refraction will be positive for any value of the incident
angle α.

Equation (22) can also be used to calculate the angle
of refraction of the photon when the medium moves in
the opposite direction to the one in Fig. 2, that is, in the
negative direction of the x-axis. However, the situation
when the photon is incident at a positive angle α upon the
medium which moves at a speed −u is physically identical
to the situation which corresponds to a negative incident
angle −α and a speed u.

At the end, we emphasize that the absolute value of
the angle of refraction β in Eq. (22) cannot become equal
or greater than 90◦, no matter what the values of α, n
and u are. In other words, it is not possible to observe
the situation in which the photon would slide along the
surface of the medium, or to be reﬂected back to the
vacuum half-space. To prove this property, we will try to
ﬁnd such a value of α which will turn the denominator
in the right-hand side of Eq. (22) into zero. This is the
condition for the angle β to equal ±90◦. Hence, α should
be such that:

Having in mind that n > 1 and u < c, we have |(n ±
u/c)(nu/c ± 1)−1| > 1, which means that there are no
real values for the angle α to satisfy Eq. (23).

IV. REFRACTION FROM A MATERIAL
HALF-SPACE MOVING PERPENDICULAR TO
THE INTERFACE

In the following, we consider the case in which the ma-
terial half-space in Sec. III is moving at a constant speed
u in the positive direction of the y-axis. The geometry
of the problem is shown in Fig. 4. Observe that unlike
the case in Sec. III, the vacuum-material interface also
is in uniform motion, having the same constant speed u
as the medium in the positive y-direction.

A photon is emitted from point A in the vacuum half-
space. At this instant, the vacuum-material interface co-
incides with the x-axis, and dA is the shortest distance
between the interface and the point A. After being re-
fracted from the moving interface, the photon reaches the
ﬁxed point B in the material half-space. We denote by
dB the shortest distance between the interface and the
point B at time when the photon was emitted from A,
and by ℓ the distance between the orthogonal projections
of the points A and B on the interface.

Due to the motion of the vacuum-material interface,
the hypothetical points from which the photon may be
refracted at the interface will not lie on the same hori-
zontal. According to Fermat’s principle, the photon will
be refracted from a point O that makes AOB the path
of the shortest transit time (see Fig. 4). We denote by
tAO the time required for the photon to go from A to O,
and by tOB the time from O to B. Observe that when
the photon reaches point O, the interface has allready

6

crossed the distance utAO in the positive y-direction from
its position y = 0 when the photon was emitted from A.
The total time tAB for the photon to travel the path

AOB is:

We now invoke the principle of least time that the value of
x should be such that the transit time tAB of the photon
is minimum. We take the derivative of tAB in Eq. (33)
with respect to x and set the result to zero to obtain:

tAB = tAO + tOB.

From Fig. 4 we have:

(ctAO)2 = (dA + utAO)2 + x2,

where v(β) is the speed of the photon in the moving
medium in the direction determined by the angle β. The
speed v(β) of the photon follows from Eq. (8) if we simply
substitute β for ϕ. In order to simplify the derivation of
the refraction formula, we re-write Eqs. (26) and (27) as:

which is the formula for the law of refraction of the pho-
ton in this case. We reject the second solution of Eq. (41)
as a physically incorrect one, from the fact that β = 0◦
when u = 0 and α = 0◦.
[A derivation of Eq. (42) via
relativistic velocity transformation formulas is provided
in Appendix A.]

The obtained refraction formula works both for posi-
tive and negative values of the incident angle α, as well
as for both moving directions of the medium. The right-
hand side of Eq. (42) is an odd function of α, and hence
the change in the sign of α does not introduce physically
new situation. The path of the photon which is incident
upon the surface at a negative angle −α will be sym-
metric with respect to the surface normal, to the path
of the photon corresponding to a positive incident angle
α. Therefore, in the following, we consider only positive
incident angles (0◦ ≤ α < 90◦).

When the medium moves in the positive direction of
the y-axis, u/c > 0 and the right-hand side of Eq. (42) is
always positive, which means that the angle of refraction
β is between 0◦ and 90◦. The dependence of β on the
incident angle α for n = 1.5 and for various positive
values of u/c is shown in Fig. 5. We see that as u/c varies
from 0 to 1, the curves corresponding to diﬀerent values
of u/c are regularly shifted toward the smaller values of β,
which is expectable if one takes into account the dragging
eﬀect of the moving medium.

The situation changes dramatically when u/c < 0. In
this case, the denominator on the right-hand side of Eq.
(42) can take zero or even negative values, which implies
that the angle of refraction β can become equal or greater
than 90◦. In Fig. 6 we plotted β as a function of α for
n = 1.5 and for various negative values of u/c. What we
see in Fig. 6 can be summarized as follows. When the
medium moves in the negative direction of the y-axis up

FIG. 6: The angle of refraction β as a function on the incident
angle α for n = 1.5 when the material half-space is moving
perpendicular to the interface, in the negative direction of
the y-axis. When −κ1 < u/c < 0 the refraction is regular,
and the angle of refraction β of the photon is in the interval
[0◦, 90◦]. For −κ2 < u/c < −κ1, the refraction is: a) regular
(0 ≤ β < 90◦), if 0 ≤ α < αc; and b) backward (90 < β <
180), if αc < α < 90◦. If u/c < κ2, the refraction is always
backward.

to some value of |u/c| denoted as κ1, the refraction seems
to be regular. In this range of speeds (−κ1 < u/c < 0), as
the absolute value of the speed increases, the curves are
shifted toward higher values of β, and β remains smaller
than 90◦ for each α. When u/c < −κ1, a speciﬁc value
for the incident angle α appears for which the angle of
refraction of the photon becomes equal to 90◦. We denote
this critical incident angle by αc. For αc < α < 90◦,
the angle of refraction β is greater than 90◦. By further
increasing the absolute value of u/c, the critical angle αc
decreases, and for some value of |u/c|, denoted by κ2, αc
becomes 0◦. For u/c < −κ2, the angle of refraction β is
greater than 90◦ for all values of α. The quantities κ1 and
κ2 are functions on the refractive index n of the medium
in its rest frame, and as n increases, the values of κ1 and
κ2 are becoming closer to each other. It can be shown
(see Appendix B) that κ1 = (1 + n2)−1/2 and κ2 = 1/n
(for n = 1.5, κ1 ≈ 0.55 and κ2 ≈ 0.67). Evidently, the
value κ2 corresponds to the smallest superluminal speed
of the medium.

The existence of angles of refraction greater than 90◦
in the case v/c < 0 implies that the photon, instead of
moving in the same general direction as before the refrac-
tion, moves backward. At ﬁrst sight, it might seem that
the photon was reﬂected at the interface instead of be-
ing refracted, but this is not what had happened. Once
the photon strikes the vacuum-material interface, it un-
dergoes a refraction, enters the medium and continues

to move into the medium at all times. The curious be-
haviour of the refracted photon is due to the fact that the
y-component of its velocity in the moving medium is neg-
ative, which means that the refracted photon will move in
the same general direction as the medium. However, the
absolute value of its y-velocity-component in the moving
medium is smaller than the speed of the medium, and
thus, the backwardly refracted photon cannot ”escape”
the medium.

We emphasize that the path of the photon that un-
dergoes a backward refraction does not coincide with the
path which it would trace if it were reﬂected from the
interface. The path of the backwardly refracted photon
is fully determined by Eq. (42), and the path of the re-
ﬂected photon obeys the Einstein’s formula for reﬂection
[27, 37, 38]).
from a uniformly moving mirror (see Ref.
In the language of modern quantum electrodynamics,
whether the photon will be reﬂected or refracted at the
inerface is a matter of probability.
In this sense, if a
beam of photons is incident on the moving interface at
an angle α, and if the conditions for the appearance of
the backward refraction are fulﬁlled, some of the photons
will be reﬂected, and some backwardly refracted. There-
fore, in a more realistic view in which the reﬂection is
considered also, two diﬀerent beams spreading backward
will be identiﬁed. In this way, we have a full consistency
between the observations with respect to both inertial
frames, S and S′. Namely, for the observer in S′-frame
in which the medium is at rest, both processes are de-
veloping in an ordinary way: the refracted photon moves
forward, obeying the Snell’s law of refraction, while the
reﬂected one moves backward, according to the usual law
incident angle equals the reﬂected angle.
of reﬂection:
Hence, the observer in S′ clearly distinguishes two rays,
and consequently, two rays must exist with respect to
the observer in the S-frame: one reﬂected, and one back-
wardly refracted.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In conclusion, we have presented a novel approach to
the problem of refraction of light when the boundaries
and the media are in uniform rectilinear motion. Our
method amalgamates the original Fermat’s principle and
the fact that a homogeneous, isotropic and non-dispersive
optical material at rest will possess an eﬀective optical
anisotropy if it is moving at a constant velocity. We have
analyzed in details the refraction at a vacuum-material
interface, when the material half-space is moving paral-
lel or perpendicular to the interface. In both cases, we
considered the plane of incidence to be normal to the in-
terface and parallel to the velocity of the medium.
In
addition, when the material half-space moves perpendic-
ular to the interface, in the direction which is opposite
to that of the incident light, we observed a “backward
refraction” of light. To our knowledge, this optical eﬀect
have not been noticed before in the literature.

8

We emphasize that the refraction formulas obtained in
this paper refer to refraction of a photon, and thus, de-
scribe the refraction of a light ray. We note that in a set
of papers on the subject of reﬂection and transmission of
a plane electromagnetic wave by a moving medium, start-
ing with the pioneering papers by Tai and Yeh, the refrac-
tion formulas for diﬀerent setups were derived by using
the notions from the classical electromagnetic theory and
the Lorentz transformation [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Al-
though these derivations also include the cases discussed
in our Sections III and IV, the resulting refraction for-
mulas do not match the refraction formulas in Eq. (22)
and (42) in this paper [46]. This mismatch is due to
the fact that Tai, Yeh and their successors consider the
angles of incidence, reﬂection and refraction of the light
wave as the angles between the corresponding propaga-
tion vectors and the interface normal. However, we have
shown that an optical isotropic medium in uniform rec-
tilinear motion becomes an optical anisotropic medium,
and hence, the propagation vector in the moving medium
will, in general, not coincide with the light ray in the
moving medium. Therefore, the refraction formulas by
Tai, Yeh and their followers do not refer to refraction of
a light ray.

The approach in this paper can be extended to include
more sophisticated situations, speciﬁcally, by taking into
account the dispersion of the material, or considering var-
ious three-dimensional cases when the plane of incidence
is not necessary normal to the interface and not parallel
to the velocity of the medium. We also suggest a rep-
etition of the derivations in Sec.
III and IV when the
refraction occurs at an interface between two uniformly
moving non-vacuum optical materials having diﬀerent re-
fractive indices in their rest frames of reference.

APPENDIX A: A DERIVATION OF EQ. (42) BY
USING RELATIVISTIC VELOCITY
TRANSFORMATION FORMULAS

The refraction formula in Eq. (42) can also be obtained
by comparing the path of the photon in the S′- frame
where the medium is stationary, to the corresponding
path of the photon in the S-frame where the medium is in
uniform rectilinear motion. We ﬁrst describe the reﬂec-
tion with respect to S′-frame. Let the vacuum-material
interface coincide with x′-axis, with y′ > 0 being the re-
gion of the material half-space, and y′ < 0 the region of
the vacuum half-space. Let the photon be incident on the
interface from the vacuum half-space in a direction mak-
ing a positive angle α′ with the interface normal. The
photon is refracted in the material half-space at an an-
gle β′ with respect to the interface normal, obeying the
Snell’s law of refraction:

sin α′ = n sin β′,

(A1)

where n is the refractive index of the medium at rest.
Taking that the incident photon moves at a speed of light

in vacuum c, and the refracted photon at a speed c/n,
the velocity components of the photon in the S′-frame
are:

We substitute Eq. (A17) into Eq. (A15) and simplify
the result to obtain the law of refraction of the photon
in Eq. (42).

where index “1” corresponds to the components of the

refracted photon (for simplicity, we use v′

of v′

terial half-space is moving at a constant speed u in the
positive y-direction, the photon is incident on the moving
interface at an angle α at the same constant speed c as
in the S′-frame, but its speed after being refracted from
the interface is vβ which is a function of the angle of re-
fraction β. Thus, the corresponding velocity components
of the photon in S-frame are:

vx1 = c sin α,
vy1 = c cos α,
vx2 = vβ sin β,
vy2 = vβ cos β.

Dividing Eq. (A8) with Eq. (A9), and using the relativis-
tic transformation formulas for the velocity components
between S and S′:

we rewrite Eq. (42) by putting −κ instead of u/c (κ =

corresponds to negative critical incident angles. What is

For a ﬁxed n, one can determine the interval of values

ward refraction actually appears, and for α < αc the
refraction is regular (forward), while for α > αc the re-
fraction is backward. The ends of the interval [κ1, κ2]
correspond to the critical incident angles αc = 90◦ and
αc = 0◦, respectively, and can be obtained from the fol-

The quadratic equation in Eq. (B11) has two solutions in

is not consistent with the inequality in Eq. (B11), since
x′
2 < 0 (we have taken into account that 0 < κ < 1).
1 = 1−κ2
Thus, the only solution of the system (B11) is x′

Since the solution x′′

Eq. (B12), we reject it and consider only the solution

Equations (B13) and (B14) determine the length of the
interval [κ1, κ2] and its dependence on n. We can now
summarize the results. For κ < (1 + n2)−1/2, the refrac-
tion is regular (forward) for any incident angle α. When
(1 + n2)−1/2 ≤ κ ≤ 1/n, there exists a critical incident
angle αc, such that for α in the interval 0◦ < α < αc the
refraction is regular (forward), while for αc < α < 90◦
the refraction is backward. The angle αc can be calcu-
It depends on κ, and tends to
lated from Eq.
zero as κ approaches 1/n. When κ = 1/n, αc = 0◦,
and the right-hand side of Eq. (B1) becomes an unde-
termined expression of type 0/0, which can be resolved
by using L’Hospital’s rule. When κ > 1/n, the denom-
inator in Eq. (B1) is negative for any α. On the other
hand, the numerator in Eq. (B1) is always non-negative.
Therefore, for κ > 1/n, β > 90◦ for each α. Hence,
when the medium is moving in the negative direction of
the y-axis, there exists a critical speed for the medium
|uc| = κ2c = c/n, corresponding to the treshold for the
“superluminal” speeds. Beyond this critical speed, the
photon will always be backwardly refracted.

is not quite correct, since there are some cases in which
the transit time is a maximum rather than a minimum.

[28] Although the speed of each photon on the wavefront of
the pulse will be frame-invariant, the frequency, the in-
tensity and the angular distribution of the photons will
depend on the reference frame from where the observa-
tion is made. See G. P. Sastry and T. R. Ravuri, “Mod-
eling some two-dimensional relativistic phenomena using
and educational interactive graphics software,” Am. J.
Phys. 58, 1066–1073 (1990).

[29] The invariance of the shape and the speed of expansion
of the pulse also follows from the Lorentz-invariance of
the equation for the wavefront of the pulse.

[46] For example, in the case when the material half-space
is moving parallel to the interface, Yeh’s refraction for-
mula predicts that when the incident angle is zero, the
refracted angle will be zero for any value for the speed of
the medium (see Ref. [41] above). This is contrary to the
observed transverse Fresnel-Fizeau light drag, which sug-
gests non-zero angles of refraction even when the incident
angle is zero.

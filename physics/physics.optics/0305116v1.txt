We consider plane waves propagating in quadratic nonlinear slab waveguides with nonlinear quasi-
phase-matching gratings. We predict analytically and verify numerically the complete gain spectrum
for transverse modulational instability, including hitherto undescribed higher order gain bands.

PACS numbers:

With the maturing of

the quasi-phase-matching
(QPM) technique, in particular by electric-ﬁeld poling
of ferro-electric materials, such as LiNbO3 [1], by poling
of polymers [2] and quantum-well disordering in semi-
conductors [3], the number of applications of quadratic
nonlinear (or χ(2)) materials has increased signiﬁcantly.
Even complicated QPM grating structures are now com-
mercially available in periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN).
It is therefore more important than ever to have com-
plete knowledge of the eﬀects a QPM grating has on the
properties of χ(2) materials. The most fundamental ef-
fect of a QPM grating, with a certain spectrum of spa-
tial wave vectors, is to allow noncritical phase matching
at all wavelengths for which the wave-vector mismatch
∆k matches a component of the grating spectrum. Thus
QPM gratings allow for eﬃcient multiple wavelength sec-
ond harmonic generation (SHG) [4], which may, for ex-
ample, be used for multiple-channel wavelength conver-
sion [5].

In addition to providing phase matching, QPM grat-
ings have the basic eﬀect that they induce an asymmetric
cubic nonlinearity (ACN) in the equations for the aver-
age ﬁeld in the form of self- and cross-phase modulation
terms [6]. This ACN appears in linear and/or nonlinear
periodic QPM gratings of arbitrary shape [7], it can be fo-
cusing or defocusing, depending on the sign of the phase
mismatch [7], and its strength can be increased (e.g.,
dominating the Kerr nonlinearity) by modulation of the
grating [8]. In continuous-wave operation the ACN in-
duces an intensity-dependent phase mismatch, just as the
inherent Kerr nonlinearity, with potential use in switch-
ing applications [9, 10]. The ACN further explains a
wide spectrum of novel fundamental properties of soli-
tons [6, 7, 11] and modulational instability (MI) [12, 13].
Importantly the ACN is a general eﬀect of non-phase-
matched wave interaction and as such appear also in
homogeneous χ(2) materials in the cascading limit.
In
fact, in this case the asymmetric signature of the ACN
may be measured as the diﬀerence between the proper-
ties in upconversion and downconversion, since there is
no eﬀective χ(2) nonlinearity competing with the ACN
as in QPM gratings. Such an experiment was recently
reported [14] and thus the ACN has now been conﬁrmed
both numerically and experimentally.

The MI gain spectrum in general QPM gratings has a
multipeaked structure of up to three fundamental bands
with accompanying overtones [12, 13]. The fundamental
(long-wave instability) bands at low transverse wavenum-
bers is due to MI of the averaged ﬁeld. For QPM with a
simultaneous linear and nonlinear grating and/or with a
nonlinear grating with a dc-value (as with QPM in poly-
mers [2] and semiconductors [3]), the ACN is necessary
to describe how these fundamental bands may disappear,
making plane waves modulationally stable over hundreds
of diﬀraction lengths [12, 13]. The gain bands in the
ﬁrst overtone were surmised to be related to the inher-
ent instability in homogeneous (non-phase-matched) χ(2)
media [12, 13]. However, an accurate description of the
ﬁrst overtone bands has not been found and the higher
overtone bands have not been discussed at all.

Here we study MI in 1+1D χ(2) media with a purely
nonlinear QPM grating with no dc-component, such as
in PPLN slab waveguides. With this simple QPM grat-
ing, it is not necessary to take into account the ACN
for an accurate description of MI [12, 13]. We present
the ﬁrst analytical and numerical description of the com-
plete MI spectrum with all overtones. We show explicitly
that the overtone series are caused by MI in the rapidly
varying components of the propagating ﬁelds, which are
in turn induced by the grating. We derive approximate
analytic expressions for the positions of the gain bands
and compare them with exact Floquet results and direct
numerical simulation, to ﬁnd good agreement.

We consider a linearly polarized electric ﬁeld propagat-
ing in a lossless χ(2) slab waveguide with a QPM grating
under conditions for (the most eﬃcient) ﬁrst-order QPM
and type I SHG. The normalized dynamical equations for
the slowly varying envelopes of the fundamental E1(x, z)
and second harmonic (SH) E2(x, z) take the form

i∂zE1 + ∂2
i∂zE2 + ∂2

xE1/2 + χ(z)E∗
xE2/4 + χ(z)E2

bands, with extrema remaining close to an=−en (diag-

To derive a simple result we consider nearly phase-

PPLN) square QPM grating, for which dn=0 for n even
and dn=2/(iπn) for n odd. The requirement |κ| ∼
|β| ≫ 1 allows us to assume that the amplitudes wn
and vn vary slowly compared to exp (iκz) and that the
higher harmonics are much smaller than the dc-ﬁelds,

(n=0), each with a set of equally spaced weak overtone
gain bands (n 6= 0). However, the gain is large only near
an=0 (see Fig. 1). For n 6= 0, an ≃ 0 can only be satisﬁed
without violating the assumptions on HB−, and thus the
overtones of the other branches will be small.

Consider κ=672 and ˜β=0, i.e., a particular PPLN crys-
tal at exact phase matching. For Λ=1 our analytic results
predict only one fundamental n=0 gain band (HB+) and
three gain bands in all overtones. However the overtones
of DB and HB+ are too small to be seen. Thus the visible
gain bands have maxima at ν0=1.18 (HB+), ν−1=36.64,
ν−2=51.84, etc. (all HB−). The analytical results agree
with exact Floquet calculations [12, 13], as seen in Fig. 2.

For Λ=−1 two fundamental n=0 bands are predicted
(DB and HB+), with one set of visible overtones from
HB−. The maxima are at ν0=2 (DB), ν0=3.38 (HB+),
ν−1=36.70, ν−2=51.88, etc. (all HB−). This is again con-
ﬁrmed by the exact Floquet calculations seen in Fig. 2.
Figure 2 also shows the gain proﬁles predicted by Eq. (8),
which again agree well with the exact Floquet results. Di-
rect numerical simulation [12, 13] of Eqs. (1-2) with MI
seeded by noise conﬁrmed again our results (see Fig. 3).

In conclusion, we have presented a simple theory able
to accurately predict the complete MI spectrum in gen-
eral QPM gratings in χ(2) materials. In particular, we
have predicted and veriﬁed that overtone gain bands orig-
inate from MI in the higher-order Fourier components of
the ﬁeld. This research is supported by the Danish Tech-
nical Research Council (Grant No. 26-00-0355) and the

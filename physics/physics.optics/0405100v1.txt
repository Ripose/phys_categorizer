(Dated: July 30, 2013)

Using the maximum-likelihood detector (MLD) of a soliton with timing jitter
and noise, other than walk-out of the bit interval, timing jitter does not degrade
the performance of MLD. When the MLD is simulated with important sampling
method, even with a timing jitter standard deviation the same as the full-width-
half-maximum (FWHM) of the soliton, the signal-to-noise (SNR) penalty is
just about 0.2 dB. The MLD performs better than conventional scheme to
lengthen the decision window with additive noise proportional to the window
wide.

Keywords: ﬁber soliton, timing jitter, Gordon-Haus eﬀect.

The Gordon-Haus timing jitter1 limits the transmis-
sion distance of a soliton communication system. The
arrival time of the soliton has a variance increase cubi-
cally with distance. Previously, the decision window of
the soliton is widened to signiﬁcantly reduce the impact
of timing jitter2. However, the widening of the decision
window allows more noise entering the decision circuits.
For example, if the decision window is doubled to twice
wider than necessary, the amount of noise is doubled.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is halved, giving 3-dB
SNR penalty to the system. Using an electro-absorption
modulator as an optical time-domain demultiplexer to
provide a wide decision window3, the timing window may
reach 80% of the bit interval for timing-jitter resilient
reception4.

In conventional detection theory5, the matched ﬁlter
based receiver maximizes the output SNR. The matched
ﬁlter can be implemented optically with an impulse re-
sponse identical to the soliton pulse shape. Unfortu-
nately, the matched ﬁlter cannot apply directly to a sig-
nal with timing jitter. A wide decision window is equiva-
lent to an intergator with an integration interval the same
as the decision window. Even for a soliton with timing
jitter, a rectangular decision window is inferior to the
match ﬁlter based receiver. Method to combat timing jit-
ter without leading to signiﬁcant increase in SNR penalty
is investigated here based on maximum-likelihood detec-
tion (MLD).

MLD of a signal minimizes the error probability of
the detection of a binary signal. If digital “1” and “0”
are represented by the presence or absence of a soliton
and assumed that “1” or “0” is transmitted with equal
probability, MLD decides the presence of a soliton by

where ak
ton, s(t) = sech(1.76t) is the normalized soliton pulse
with unity full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), t0 is a
random variable representing the timing jitter, φ is the
random phase due to the propagation delay and soliton
phase jitter, and n(t) is the additive complex-value white
Gaussian noise with spectral density of N0/2. Only the
noise with the same polarization as the soliton is consid-
ered here by assuming a polarized receiver. The phase of
φ is assumed to be uniformly distributed from 0 to 2π.

Usually, soliton propagation with noise is studied by
the ﬁrst-order perturbation of the soliton2,6,7,8 in which
ampliﬁer noise is directly projected to amplitude and fre-
quency jitter. When the ﬁrst-order soliton perturbation
is linearized2, there is no diﬀerence whether amplitude
jitter is a distributed contribution along the ﬁber or a
lumped contribution at the beginning or the end of the
ﬁber. For example, if n(t) = n1(t) + n2(t) with n1(t)
and n2(t) from the ﬁrst and second half of the ﬁber link,
respectively. With the small signal or linearized model2,
the projection of n(t) to amplitude and frequency jitter
is the same as ﬁrst applied n1(t) and then n2(t), or even
ﬁrst applied n2(t) and then n1(t). Of course, if ﬁrst-order
large signal perturbation is used, there is small diﬀerence
between the distributed or lumped model2,9,10. The re-
ceived signal of (1) assumes all ampliﬁer noise at the end
of the ﬁber link and is more accurate than ﬁrst-order per-
turbation for amplitude and frequency jitter if time jitter
is included in t0 and phase jitter is included in φ.

If the soliton is detected by a photodetector, the phase
of φ in (1) does not aﬀect the system performance. With

The decision rule of (6) together with the parameter q
calculated by (4) can be implemented by the block dia-
gram of Fig. 1. The received signal ﬁrst passes thought
an optical matched ﬁlter having an impulse response
equal to the soliton pulse of s(t). The output of the
optical matched ﬁlter is qejφ. The output of the op-
tical matched ﬁlter converts to electrical signal using a
photodetector. The photodetector gives an output pro-
portional to the square of q2. The implementation of
the correlation of (4) using matched ﬁlter can be found,

Fig. 2. Simulated error probability of the MLD for soli-
ton with timing jitter. Various markers are the error
probability from simulation. Dashed-line is the theoret-
ical error probability without timing jitter. Solid lines
include the walk-out probability that the timing jitter is
outside the bit interval.

for example, in [5, ch. 6]. With the output of q2 from
the photodetector, the value of I0(2√Eq/N0) in (6) can
be found. The integration in (6) with respect to t0 is
again implemented using a ﬁlter with impulse response
of pT (t0) which output is sampled at the right time. In
Fig. 1, the probability density of pT (t0) is not necessary
to be Gaussian distributed9,11 but must be symmetrical
with respect to zero. After the sampler, the presence or
absence of the soliton is decided when compared with
exp(E/N0).

Without timing jitter or pT (t0) = δ(t0), the right-hand
sided of (6) becomes I0(2√Eq/N0)
t0=0 and the decision
|
rule of (6) can be simpliﬁed to a quadratic detector [5,
q2
Sec. 8.3]. The quadratic detector is q2
th with qth as
the optimal threshold without timing jitter. With a per-
formance the same as that for non-coherent detection of
amplitude-shift keying signal, the performance can be an-
alyzed by the well-known Marcum Q-function12,13. The
error probability for the case without timing jitter is
shown in Fig. 2 as dashed line. The error probability
of Fig. 2 is shown as a function of SNR, given by the
ratio of E/N0. The threshold of detection is calculated
using (6) with pT (t0) = δ(t0). An error probability of
10−9 requires an SNR about 18.9 dB.

The performance of the MLD of (6) does not lead to a
simple analytical error probability for soliton with timing
jitter. Numerical simulation is conducted if the timing
jitter is zero-mean Gaussian distributed with variance of
σ2
t . The simulation results are shown in Fig. 2 with σt
normalized to the FWHM of the soliton. Fig. 2 shows
that MLD for soliton with timing jitter has very small

SNR penalty for σt up to one FWHM of the soliton.

In order to investigate those cases with very small error
probabilities, numerical simulation cannot be conducted
directly based on Monte-Carlo methods. The simulation
of Fig. 2 is based on important sampling, similar to the
methods of [10,14]. The received signal has soliton with
diﬀerent timing jitter according the Gaussian distribu-
tion with variance of σ2
t . The noise sample after the
optical matched ﬁlter of Fig. 1 with a time correspond-
ing to the peak optical intensity is generated based on
uniform distribution. Other noise samples are generated
by Gaussian distribution with a covariance depending on
the optical matched ﬁlter. Each error count is weighted
according to the probability diﬀerence between the ac-
tual Gaussian noise samples with the generated noise
samples10,14. Other than adding a biased noise sample
after the optical matched ﬁlter of Fig. 1 instead of the
actual signal with ampliﬁer noises before the ﬁlter, the
numerical simulation followed closely the detector of Fig.
1.

The error probability calculated from simulation is
shown in Fig. 2 using diﬀerent marker for σt from 0.1
to 1.0 of the FWHM of the soliton. Even with a soliton
having a large timing jitter of σt = 1.0, the SNR penalty
is just about 0.2 dB compared with the case without tim-
ing jitter (dashed line). If a widening decision window is
used instead, for example, σt = 0.5 requires a decision
window wide of τw
6 such that the probability of the
soliton walking-out of the decision window is less than
10−9 [1]. A decision window size
erfc
6 gives approximately 7 dB of SNR penalty.

(cid:2)
Fig. 2 also shows the error probability taking into ac-
count the probability that the soliton may have a timing
jitter outside the bit interval when σt = 0.8, 1.0 and
the bit interval is 10 times the FWHM of the soliton.
The bit interval of T = 10 is chosen for convenience1.
For σt < 0.8, the walk-out probability does not aﬀect the
overall error probability and is not shown in Fig. 2. From
Fig. 2, soliton with large timing jitter is mainly aﬀected
by the walk-out probability, especially for system with a
bit interval just T = 4, 6 times the FWHM of the soli-
ton. Unlike the receiver with widening decision window,
the simulation results of Fig. 2 show that the receiver
schematic of Fig. 1 does not give large SNR penalty.

(cid:3)

The MLD of (6) or Fig. 1 has a ﬁlter with impulse

3

response the same as the probability density of pT (t0).
The walk-out probability depends on the tail of pT (t0)
but the left hand-sided of (6) depends on the center of
pT (t0) around its mean of t0 = 0. While the MLD of (6)
depends weakly on the timing jitter variance of σ2
t , the
walk-out probability depends strongly on σ2
t as from Fig.
2.

The MLD of soliton with timing jitter is derived, to
our knowledge, the ﬁrst time. Other than the walk-out
probability that the soliton has a timing jitter outside the
bit-interval, soliton is not aﬀected by timing jitter when
MLD is used. Even with a timing jitter standard devi-
ation the same as the soliton FWHM, the SNR penalty
is just about 0.2 dB. The MLD has signiﬁcantly smaller
SNR penalty than detector with a widening decision win-
dow.

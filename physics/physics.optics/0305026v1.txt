Abstract

Free-space propagation can be described as a shearing of the Wigner distribution func-

tion in the spatial coordinate; this shearing is linear in paraxial approximation but assumes

a more complex shape for wide-angle propagation. Integration in the frequency domain al-

lows the determination of near-ﬁeld diffraction, leading to the well known Fresnel diffrac-

tion when small angles are considered and allowing exact prediction of wide-angle diffrac-

tion. The authors use this technique to demonstrate evanescent wave formation and diffrac-

tion elimination for very small apertures.

The Wigner distribution function (WDF) provides a convenient way to describe an optical

signal in space and spatial frequency [1, 2]. The propagation of an optical signal through ﬁrst-

order optical systems is well described by the WDF transformations [3, 4], which allows the

reconstruction of the propagated signal. On the other hand, some authors have linked Fresnel

diffraction and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) [5, 6]; both of these papers associate

free-space propagation to a rotation of the WDF and the corresponding FRFT accompanied by

a quadratic phase factor.

In this paper we show that free-space propagation is always associated with shearing of the

WDF. This can be used to evaluate the near-ﬁeld diffraction. In the paraxial approximation our

results duplicate the well known Fresnel diffraction, with the advantage that we do not need to

resort to the Cornu integrals. The same procedure can be extended to wide angles, where other

phenomena are apparent, namely the presence of evanescent waves.

The Wigner distribution function (WDF) of a scalar, time harmonic, and coherent ﬁeld

distribution ϕ(q, z) can be deﬁned at a z = const. plane in terms of either the ﬁeld distribution

or its Fourier transform ϕ(p) =

ϕ(q) exp(−ikqT p)dq [2, 3]:

In the paraxial approximation, propagation in a homogeneous medium of refractive index n

produces a perfect mapping of the WDF according to the relation [2, 3]

W (q, p, z) = W (q −

p, p, 0).

After the WDF has been propagated over a distance, the ﬁeld distribution can be recovered by

The ﬁeld intensity distribution can also be found by

Eqs. (4) and (5) are all that is needed for the evaluation of Fresnel diffraction ﬁelds. Con-

sider the diffraction pattern for a rectangular aperture in one dimension. The WDF of the

W (q, p) =

Fig. 1 shows a typical diffraction pattern obtained in this way.

For wide angles the WDF can no longer be mapped from the initial to the ﬁnal planes. It

must be born in mind that the components of the conjugate momentum p correspond to the

direction cosines of the propagating direction multiplied by the refractive index; the appropriate

transformation is given by [7]

W (q − zp/

n2 − |p|2, p, 0)

Eq. (8) shows that only spatial frequencies corresponding to momenta such that |p| < n

can be propagated [8]. In fact |p|/n = sin α, with α the angle the ray makes with the z axis.

It is then obvious that the higher frequencies would correspond to values of | sin α| > 1; these

frequencies don’t propagate and originate evanescent waves instead, Fig. 2. The net effect on

near-ﬁeld diffraction is that the high-frequency detail near the aperture is quickly reduced.

The ﬁeld intensity can now be evaluated by the expression

Fig. 3 shows the near-ﬁeld diffraction pattern when the aperture is exactly one wavelength

wide. The situation is such that all the high order maxima of the WDF appear at values of

|p| > 1 and are evanescent, resulting in a ﬁeld pattern with one small minimum immediately

after the aperture, after which the beam takes a quasi-gaussian shape, without further minima.

A sub-wavelength resolution would be possible about half a wavelength in front of the aperture,

where the ﬁeld distribution shows a very sharp peak.

We return now to the subject of FRFT to analyze the connection between this and Fres-

nel diffraction. Being associated with a rotation of the WDF, the FRFT can only represent

diffraction if associated with a quadratic phase factor that effectively transforms the rotation

in a shearing operation [5]. The implementation of the FRFT needs a combination of paraxial

free-space propagation, a thin lens and a magniﬁcation telescope [6, 9].

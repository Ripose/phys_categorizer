Abstract

We study the transmission properties for the waveguide bends composed by a circular photonic

crystal. Two types (Y and U type) of the waveguide bends utilizing the circular photonic crystal

are studied. It has been shown, compared with the conventional photonic crystal waveguide bends,

transmission properties for these bends can be signiﬁcantly improved. Over a 6.4% bandwidth,
less than 1-dB loss/bend are observed. U bent waveguide, i.e., 180o bend, can be easily realized

with low loss using the circular photonic crystal.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic Crystals (PhCs) are artiﬁcial structures with periodically modulating refrac-

tive indices and have photonic bandgaps wherein the propagation of photons is prohibited

[1, 2, 3]. PhCs have received considerable attention owing to their abilities for the realization

of ultra-compact and multi-functional devices for high-density photonic integrated circuits

(PICs) [4]. It is inevitable for introducing waveguide bends in the high-density PICs. This

kind of waveguide bends, speciﬁcally sharp corners, represents a discontinuity for a wave

propagating through the waveguide and becomes one of the main contributions in not only

generating loss but also limiting the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. Various alter-

native approaches for bend designs have been theoretically or experimentally studied, e.g.,

deforming the PhCs lattice near the bend [5, 6], adding a defect at the bend [7], optimization

the waveguide bends [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and using of polycrystalline PC lattice [13]. Most of

these works are based on the optimization method for the bends, in which the structure of

the waveguide bends are always much complicated.

In this paper, we propose a simple method for designing waveguide bends and demonstrate

the use of a circular photonic crystal as a waveguide bend to improve transmission property

of the bend in a two-dimensional triangular photonic crystal. Y and U type of waveguide

bends are considered in the following text.

II. DESIGN AND SIMULATION RESULTS

The two-dimensional photonic crystal we considered here is a triangular lattice of air holes

in a dielectric medium with a lattice constant a and a hole radius r = 0.3a. The refractive

index of the dielectric medium 3.24 has been assumed, corresponding to the the index of

InP/GaInAsP around λ = 1.55µm. It can be obtained by the plane-wave expansion method

[14] that such a structure has a bandgap for transverse-electric (TE) modes from 0.22(a/λ)

to 0.29(a/λ). To guide light, photonic crystal waveguides (PhCWs) are then introduced by

removing one row of air holes, which are oriented along ΓK direction. For the triangular
lattice conﬁguration, a conventional PhCW bend is naturally bent in steps of 60o, which

is shown in Fig. 1(a). Due to the discontinuity of the generic PhCW bend, light will be

scattered by air holes around the corner when going through it, which leads to high bending

loss and narrow bandwidth of the transmitted signal. To overcome these limitations, we

design the waveguide bend by use of part of a circular photonic crystal (CPC)[15] instead of

the generic PhC bend, which is shown in Fig. 1(b). The CPC is non-periodic but systematic

arrangement of air holes, which exhibits sixfold symmetry. The air holes are arranged in

the form of concentric circles with radial distance d = √3a/2, matched with the triangular

photonic crystal. The positions of the air holes in the xy plane for such a CPC are given by

bandgap for TE modes between 0.22(a/λ) to (0.3a/λ), which makes it possible that light

can be guided by the waveguide of the CPC. For the CPC is non-periodic, it should be noted

that there is no bandgap in the region of large radial distance, where the CPC is almost

like a square lattice of air holes in a dielectric medium (without bandgap for TE modes).

Looked again back to Fig. 1 (b), compared with the conventional PhCW bend (as shown

in Fig. 1 (a)), the CPC makes the bend much smoother, e. g., the discontinuity at the

bend becomes much smaller. Moreover, we also keep the symmetry of the corner, which is

vital for improvement of transmission eﬃciency as described by Jensen et. al. [8]. In our all

simulations, we use a dielectric waveguide as input and output waveguide and put a detector

in the output waveguide. In order to accurately obtain transmission spectra of the waveg-

uide bend, we need to separate the transmission spectra of the bend from the complicate

propagation loss, as well as the in/out coupling loss when light travels through the photonic

crystal waveguide. Here we use a straight photonic crystal waveguide as a reference, which

has same propagation length, as well as identical in-coupling and out coupling mechanisms.

The transmission of the bend can then be deﬁned as the ratio of the output power P0 for the

waveguide bend to the reference power Pi for the corresponding straight waveguide, which

is given by T = 10log10(Pi/P0). Numerical simulations for the bends are performed by the

two-dimensional ﬁnite-diﬀerence-time-domain (FDTD) computational method [16] with a

boundary treatment of perfectly matched layers [17].

First we study the case of Y type waveguide bend, i.e., 60o bend, in a W1 channel

waveguide oriented along ΓK direction. The conventional bend in the triangular photonic

crystal is shown in Fig. 1 (a). It has been shown by several authors [5, 10, 11, 12] that the

transmission of this generic waveguide bend is quite small. Light will be strongly scattered by

air holes around the corner due to the mismatch of the guided mode. In order to minimize the

scattering, we use a matched circular photonic crystal to connect the conventional PhCW,

which are shown in Fig. 1 (b),(c) and (d). The regions between two solid lines are the

transition region for the bends. Only diﬀerence for these three structures is the position of the

center (O) for the CPC. Waveguides in the CPC can be denoted by N, where N = 5, 7 and

9 represent the waveguide structures of Fig. 1 (b), (c) and (d), respectively. Transmission

spectra of the bend, i.e, bend loss, can be obtained by the method mentioned before in order

to eliminate the coupling and the propagation loss. Bend losses for the structures shown in

Fig. 1 are plotted in Fig. 2. The solid line with asterisk markers represents the bend loss

for the conventional PhCW bend and the solid, dotted and dashed line represent the bend

loss for the three waveguide bends utilizing the CPC, respectively. It is obviously seen that

the bend loss for the generic bend is much large in our considered frequency region, which is

in agreement with other results [5, 10, 11, 12]. For the bends by use of the CPC, the bend

losses are quite small in a large frequency domain, which agrees well with what we expected

above. It can also be seen from Fig. 2 that less than 1-dB loss/bend can be obtained in a

normalized frequency range from 0.272(a/λ) to 0.288(a/λ). As for the working wavelength

λ = 1.55µm, the bandwidth is about 90nm. Compared other corresponding work in the

literatures [9, 10, 11], although the bandwidth for the low bend loss in this paper is not the

best result, the bandwidth is still enough wide for the practical application. Moreover, the

structure of the waveguide bend is much simpler than those in Ref. [9, 10, 11].

Figure 3 shows the steady-state magnetic ﬁeld distribution (ω = 0.276(a/λ)) of the

mode proﬁle when light goes through the waveguide bends. The left image shows the mode

behavior for light travelling through the generic PhCW bend and right image is for the bend

by use of the CPC, the corresponding structure of which is shown in Fig. 1(b). One can

clearly see from the Fig. 3(a) that transmission is quite small for such a generic PhCW

bend. However, shown in Fig. 3(b), the CPC waveguide bend guides the light nicely, which

is in agreement with the description above.

As for the high-density, it is necessary to introduce diﬀerent type of waveguide bend in
PICs. Next we consider U type photonic crystal waveguide bend, i.e., 180o bend, by use

of the circular photonic crystal. The CPC bend structure can be introduced by removing

waveguide can also be denoted by N = 3, 5, 7 and 9 for four kinds of U type waveguide

bends. Our simulation results are shown in Fig. 5. The solid, dotted, dashed line and

solid line with asterisk markers represent the bend loss for the four bends shown in Fig. 4,

respectively. One can see from Fig. 5, the bend loss are quite small in a relative wide band

for these U type waveguide bends. Over 6.4% bandwidth, less than 1-dB loss/bend can be

observed for the structure shown in Fig. 4 (a). As for the working wavelength λ = 1.55µm,

the bandwidth is about 100nm, which is enough wide for application. It can be also seen

from Fig. 5 that the bandwidth for large transmission becomes narrow, especially for the

results of the dotted line, with increasing of the bend radius. This is mainly caused by the

eﬀect that the bandgap for the CPC will shrink with the increase of the radial length due

to its non-periodic structure. Figure 6 shows the steady-state magnetic ﬁeld distribution

for the light ω = 0.2827(a/λ). The mode behavior for light travelling through the bend

(corresponding structure is shown in Fig. 5 (a)) is shown in the left image. Right image

shows the mode behavior for light going through the structure shown in Fig. 5 (b). They
both show that such these CPC waveguide bends can realize 180o turning with much low

bend losses. For the structure of Fig. 5(a), the bend radius is about 1µm for the working

wavelength λ = 1.55µm, which is quite small.

III. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have studied the waveguide bends by use of a circular photonic crystal.

Compared with the conventional generic PhCW bends, the bends with CPC have shown good

transmission properties not only of the transmission eﬃciency, but also of the bandwidth

with the large transmission. Two types (Y type and U type) of the waveguide bends utilizing

the circular photonic crystal are considered in this paper. Over a 6.4% bandwidth, less than

1-dB loss/bend are observed. For the working wavelength λ = 1.55µm, the bandwidth

is about 100nm, which is enough wide for the application. Moreover, very small bend

radius of about 1µm for U type bend can be easily obtained. Further work on experimental

veriﬁcation of our results mentioned above has been in the progress, which will be presented

in the future.

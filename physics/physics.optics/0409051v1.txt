Abstract

A sharp resonance line that appears in three-photon transitions between the 1S0 and 3P0 states of

alkaline earth and Yb atoms is proposed as an optical frequency standard. This proposal permits

the use of the even isotopes, in which the clock transition is narrower than in proposed clocks

using the odd isotopes and the energy interval is not aﬀected by external magnetic ﬁelds or the

polarization of trapping light. The method has the unique feature that the width and rate of the

clock transition can be continuously adjusted from the M Hz level to sub-mHz without loss of

signal amplitude by varying the intensities of the three optical beams. Doppler and recoil eﬀects

can be eliminated by proper alignment of the three optical beams or by point conﬁnement in a

lattice trap. The three beams can be mixed to produce the optical frequency corresponding to the

3P0 - 1S0 clock interval.

Atomic clocks using optical transitions with high intrinsic line-Q oﬀer unprecedented

opportunities for improved metrology standards [1] and tests of fundamental physics [2].

Recently, much attention has focused on using the forbidden 1S0 → 3P0 transitions in alkaline

earth and Yb atoms, which become weakly allowed in the odd isotopes through the hyperﬁne

interaction of the nuclear spin [3]. The atoms can be conﬁned in an optical lattice trap to

eliminate the ﬁrst-order Doppler and recoil eﬀects, and the trap wavelength can be set to the

‘magic’ value at which the ground and excited states undergo the same light shift, leaving

the clock transition unshifted [3].

Here we discuss the alternative of basing a clock on the sharp lines that appear in three-

photon transitions between the 1S0 and 3P0 states. This method permits the use of the

even isotopes, in which the clock transition is narrower than in the odd isotopes and the

energy interval is not aﬀected by external magnetic ﬁelds or the polarization of trapping

light at the magic wavelength. The three-photon scheme oﬀers other interesting options.

By varying the intensities of the three optical beams the rate, and hence the width, of the

clock transition can be continuously adjusted from the MHz level to sub-mHz without

loss of signal amplitude. Furthermore, proper alignment of the three beams can eliminate

Doppler and recoil eﬀects without the point conﬁnement of a lattice trap. Finally, the three

beams can be mixed to produce the clock frequency corresponding to the 3P0 - 1S0 interval.

The proposed frequency standard consists of four atomic energy levels interacting with

three light ﬁelds: a strong coupling ﬁeld, a weak coupling ﬁeld, and a probe ﬁeld, as shown

in Fig. 1 (a). Our general results will be applicable to any of the alkaline earth atoms

and Yb, but as an example the four levels for the speciﬁc case of Yb are shown in Fig. 1

(b). Relevant transitions and wavelengths for Ca, Sr and Yb are shown in Table I. The

idea is based on the concept of electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption

(EITA) [4]. The three light ﬁelds connect the state |1i (the 1S0 ground state) to the state
|4i (the metastable 3P0 state) via two short-lived intermediate states, |2i and |3i (3P1 and
3S1), but the width and position of the three-photon EITA features are determined by the

narrow initial and ﬁnal states and not the relatively broad intermediate states. In the case

of the even isotopes trapped in an optical dipole trap [3], the ground and the metastable

state both have zero total angular momentum, so their energy diﬀerence is unaﬀected by

external magnetic ﬁelds or trapping light polarization. Here for simplicity we assume only

one sublevel in each intermediate state (3P1 and 3S1) participates, and ignore any eﬀect of

2

(1)

(2)

polarization of the light ﬁelds. We also ignore other decays of 3S1, including those to the
metastable 3P2 state, from which atoms can be removed by a separate laser.

Under the rotating wave approximation, the four-level atomic system coupled to the three

light ﬁelds can be described by the following density matrix equation,

dρ(t)
dt

= −

i
~ [H, ρ(t)] + L [ρ(t)] ,

where ρ(t) is the atomic density matrix. The summation of the diagonal elements satisﬁes

the probability normalization, i.e., ρ11 + ρ22 + ρ33 + ρ44 = 1.

where Ωp, Ωs and Ωw (see Fig. 1) are the complex Rabi frequencies associated with the

couplings of the probe ﬁeld, the strong coupling ﬁeld and the weak coupling ﬁeld to atomic

transitions |1i → |2i , |2i → |3i and |3i → |4i, respectively. ∆p = ωp − ω21, ∆s = ωs − ω32

and ∆w = ωw − ω34 are the detunings between the ﬁeld frequencies, ωp, ωs and ωw, and the

atomic resonance frequencies, ω21, ω32 and ω34, respectively. The Liouvillian matrix L [ρ(t)]

describes relaxation by spontaneous decay, and is deﬁned in Eq. (3). Because the ground

state |1i and the metastable state |4i normally have very long coherent times (typically

much larger than seconds), here we assume there is no decay from these states. Decay rates

γ32 and γ34 give the decay from state |3i to states |2i and |4i respectively, and typically they
have values of order 107s−1 or larger. γ21 is the rate from |2i to |1i (the intercombination
transition 3P1 → 1S0), and the value ranges from about 106s−1 in Yb to about 103s−1 in

Ca.

In the following numerical calculations, we choose γ32 = γ34 = 10γ21 = γ, where γ

denotes the atomic characteristic decay rate, and the relative value of γ21 is appropriate for

Yb. With Sr and Ca, the basic behavior will be similar, but some numerical details will be

markedly diﬀerent because γ21 is much smaller.

Considering the system in steady state (dρ/dt = 0) and retaining the probe ﬁeld only to

ﬁrst order in |Ωp|2, we obtain the following expression for the absorption rate of the probe

light per atom:

(cid:18)

where M =

|Ωs|2

2(∆s+∆p)+i(γ34+γ32)+

|Ωw |2
2(∆w −∆s−∆p)

. When |Ωp| ≪ |Ωw|, γ21, γ32, γ34 < |Ωs|, a very

sharp absorption peak appears due to the electromagnetically induced transparency and

absorption, as shown by the solid line in Fig. 2. Here for illustration, we chose |Ωp| =

0.0001γ, |Ωw| = 0.01γ, |Ωs| = 3γ, and ∆s = ∆w = 0. The sharp peak is much narrower

than the normal single-photon absorption peak, shown by the dashed line in Fig. 2 with

|Ωw| = |Ωs| = 0.

Close to the sharp absorption peak, when the three-photon detuning ∆ ≡ ∆s + ∆p − ∆w

is very small (i.e. when |∆| ≪ |Ωw|2/|2(∆s + ∆p) + i(γ34 + γ32)|), Eq. (4) takes a simple

form that exhibits most of the important features:

Im(Ωpρ21) = ρ11|Ωp|2[γ21(1 + 4(∆ − ¯∆)2/W 2)]−1,

(5)

where W = γ21|Ωw|2/|Ωs|2 is the full width of the three-photon resonance and ¯∆ =
−∆p|Ωw|2/|Ωs|2 is the shift in the resonance peak from ∆ = 0 due to individual photon

mistunings. Both this width and shift become arbitrarily small as |Ωs| increases, as illus-

trated in Fig. 3. Thus the line width of the resonance can be very narrow and give a very

high Q-value. Also, the height of the peak in Eq. (5) clearly equals the full single-photon

absorption rate ρ11|Ωp|2/γ21, as was shown in Fig. 2.

Under the further assumption that |Ωs/Ωw|2 ≫ 1, the position of the sharp absorption

peak in Eq. (5) may be written in terms of the probe laser frequency as

∆P eak
p

= ∆w − ∆s − W (∆w − ∆s)/γ21.

(6)

This shows that the shift in the peak position from the atomic intrinsic three-photon reso-

nance frequency is less than the linewidth W provided the detuning of the individual ﬁelds

is controlled well enough that |∆s − ∆w| < γ21. In this case, if the probe laser frequency

is locked to the narrow peak, although the individual frequencies of the strong and weak

coupling laser ﬁelds might still ﬂuctuate, the algebraic sum of the three laser frequencies is

locked very close to the three-photon resonance, i.e., ωp +ωs −ωw ≈ ω21 +ω32 −ω34. External

magnetic ﬁelds or optical trapping ﬁelds can shift the intermediate states relative to the |1i

and |4i states, and thereby shift the three-photon resonance peak a small amount according

to Eq. (6). A more detailed analysis of such eﬀects, as well as the eﬀect of polarization of

the individual optical ﬁelds will appear elsewhere [5].

Because the signal-noise ratio of an error signal determines the line width of a laser

locked to a frequency discriminator [6], probe light intensity is normally increased until the

absorption rate shortens the coherence time of the transition and broadens the line. These

same considerations apply here. As |Ωp|2 increases, the probed sharp absorption peak will

be broadened and, when (∆w − ∆s) is ﬁnite, pushed away from the intrinsic three-photon

resonance frequency, as shown in Fig. 4. Here Eq. (1) is solved numerically, thereby reﬂecting

the nonlinear eﬀect of |Ωp|2. Thus in practice, we have to make a proper trade-oﬀ between

the distortion of the sharp absorption peak and the signal magnitude. It is evident that a

system composed of a large number of atoms, such as laser-cooled neutral atoms, is more

ideal to realize this proposal, because the absorption rate will be increased and the low light

intensity limitation can be balanced. In addition, to reduce technical noise, some alternative

ways to detect the sharp resonance feature can be considered in experiments. For example,

detecting the ﬂuorescence instead of the absorption can be considered because ﬂuorescence

peaks due to decays from states |2i and |3i have good correspondences with the absorption

peak.

The Doppler eﬀect is always a major cause of shifts and broadening of sharp optical

resonances even for cold atoms. Neutral atom frequency standards typically use the method

of Ramsey interference to eliminate the ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect, while trapped ion standards

and the optical lattice proposal make use of Lamb-Dicke conﬁnement. A third technique

becomes available for three-photon transitions: Doppler-free alignment of the three laser

beams [7]. If the light wave vectors satisfy the phase matching relation (7), the Doppler

frequency shift is zero regardless of the atomic velocity. Atoms with arbitrary velocities can

5

therefore contribute to the probe signal eﬀectively and hence enhance the signal-noise ratio.

It is therefore equivalent to the Ramsey method and superior to conventional Doppler-free

saturated absorption spectroscopy, in which only atoms with zero velocity contribute to the

signal. Also, the condition on the wave vectors (8) is relaxed in comparison with two-photon

electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT) [8], and readily satisﬁed in Yb, Sr and Ca,

as shown in Table I.

kp + ks − kw = 0

|kp − ks| ≤ kw ≤ kp + ks

(7)

(8)

In practice, alignment of the three beams will not be perfect; however, partial cancellation

of the Doppler eﬀect could still be very useful because it would correspondingly increase

the size of the Lamb-Dicke region, thereby eliminating the ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect when

atoms are conﬁned in a region larger than the optical wavelength. An additional advantage

of this Doppler-free alignment is that there is no net momentum transfer in the three-photon

transition process from light ﬁelds to the atom; thus there is no recoil energy shift of the

resonance.

A practical issue with the three-photon technique is how to combine the three laser

frequencies to make an optical frequency standard. To begin with, it is necessary for the

sum of the laser frequencies, ωp +ωs −ωw, to have a very small jitter, since this is the eﬀective

frequency of the sharp EITA peak that constitutes the clock reference. The complexity of

independently stabilizing each laser to its own optical cavity can be avoided by using non-

linear techniques to directly generate a beam at the clock frequency ωclock = ωp + ωs − ωw;

this beam can be frequency-locked to a stable optical cavity by applying the correction to

only one laser. The corrections applied to the single stabilized laser will correct for both its

own frequency ﬂuctuations as well as those of the other two lasers according to the algebraic

relationship given above. The mixing can be done either in two steps using two separate

doubly-resonant build-up cavities [9] or in a single step (as a 4-wave mixing process) in a

single triply-resonant cavity [9]. A more indirect method for stabilizing the lasers would

be to compare the three lasers to the nearest components of a comb[10] generated by a

femtosecond laser whose repetition rate is stabilized to a radiofrequency source. If ∆ωp, ∆ωs

and ∆ωw are the three beat notes for the lasers, the quantity ∆ωclock = ∆ωp ± ∆ωs ± ∆ωw

6

could be generated by radiofrequency mixing and applied to one of the lasers using an

optical modulator. The comb spacing would be stabilized using a fourth, “ﬂywheel” laser;

this would lock the frequency of the radiofrequency source.

In conclusion, we have set forth the scheme for an optical frequency standard based on the

remarkably sharp resonance line that appears in three-photon transitions between the 1S0
and 3P0 states of alkaline earth and Yb atoms. The scheme has an advantage of permitting

the use of the even isotopes, in which the clock transition is narrower than in the odd isotopes

and should be shifted by external magnetic ﬁelds or polarized trapping light. Based on the

electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption, the width of the clock resonance

in the scheme can be continuously adjusted from the MHz level to sub-mHz without loss of

signal amplitude by varying the intensities of the three optical beams. We believe that this

unique feature will be very useful in locking lasers to the transition. Furthermore, Doppler

and recoil eﬀects can be eliminated without the point conﬁnement of a lattice trap by a

proper alignment of the three beams.

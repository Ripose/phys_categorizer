Self-consistent simulations of the ultrafast electron dynamics in thin metal
ﬁlms are performed. A regime of nonlinear oscillations is observed, which
corresponds to ballistic electrons bouncing back and forth against the ﬁlm
surfaces. When an oscillatory laser ﬁeld is applied to the ﬁlm, the ﬁeld energy
is partially absorbed by the electron gas. Maximum absorption occurs when
the period of the external ﬁeld matches the period of the nonlinear oscillations,
which, for sodium ﬁlms,
lies in the infrared range. Possible experimental
implementations are discussed.

The recent progress in the study of metallic nanostructures is mainly due to the development
of ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, which allow the experimentalist to probe the electron
dynamics on a femtosecond (and, more recently, attosecond) time scale. Typical “pump-
probe” experiments involve perturbing the system via a ﬁrst stronger pulse, followed by a
second weaker pulse that acts as a diagnostic tool. By modulating the relative amplitude of
the signals, as well as the delay between the pump and the probe, it is possible to assess
with great precision the dynamical relaxation of the electron gas.1–4

In the present work, we focus on the ultrafast electron dynamics in thin metallic ﬁlms.
Several experiments have shown1, 2 that electron transport in thin metal ﬁlms occurs on a
femtosecond time scale and involves ballistic electrons traveling at the Fermi velocity of the
metal vF . These ﬁndings were corroborated by accurate numerical simulations,5 which high-
lighted a regime of slow nonlinear oscillations corresponding to ballistic electrons bouncing
back and forth on the ﬁlm surfaces. These oscillations were recently measured in transient re-
ﬂection experiments on thin gold ﬁlms.6 The existence of this regime prompted us to analyze
the possibility of boosting energy absorption in the ﬁlm by optically exciting the electron
gas at the frequency of the nonlinear oscillations.

In the rest of this Letter, time is normalized in units of the inverse plasmon frequency
pe , velocity in units of the Fermi speed vF , and length in units of LF = vF /ωpe. For alkali

metals we have LF = 0.59 (rs/a0)1/2 ˚A, ω−1
eV and TF = 5.82 × 105 (rs/a0)−2 K, where rs is the Wigner-Seitz radius. We concentrate
primarily on sodium ﬁlms, for which rs = 4a0 (a0 = 0.529 ˚A is the Bohr radius).

We consider a system of electrons interacting via a Coulomb potential and conﬁned within
a slab of thickness L. The ion background is represented by a ﬁxed density with soft edges,
ni(x) = ni [1 + exp ((|x| − L/2)/σi)]−1, where ni = 3/(4πr3
s) is the ion density of the bulk
metal and σi ≪ L a diﬀuseness parameter.7 In this jellium model, the self-consistent electro-
static potential depends only on the coordinate normal to the surface (here noted x). Thus,
the motion of an electron parallel to the surface of the ﬁlm is completely decoupled from the
motion normal to the surface and a one-dimensional (1D) model can be adopted.

The electrons are initially prepared in a Fermi-Dirac equilibrium at ﬁnite (but small)
temperature. They are subsequently excited by imposing a constant velocity shift ∆vx =
0.08vF to the initial distribution.7 This scenario is appropriate when no linear momentum is
transferred parallel to the plane of the surface (i.e., qk = 0) and is relevant to the excitation
of the ﬁlm with optical pulses.8 For qk = 0, only longitudinal modes (volume plasmon with
ω = ωpe) can be excited.

After the excitation is applied, the electron distribution function fe(x, vx, t) starts evolving

in time according to the semiclassical Vlasov equation

where me is the electron mass and e denotes the absolute electron charge. The electrostatic
potential is obtained self-consistently, at each instant, from Poisson’s equation

with ne = R fedvx. As a reference case, we studied a sodium ﬁlm with initial temperature
Te = 0.008TF ≃ 300 K, diﬀuseness parameter σi = 0.3LF, and thickness L = 50LF ≃ 59 ˚A.8
The time evolution of the thermal Eth and center-of-mass Ecm energies was analyzed5 (Fig.
1). During an initial rapidly-oscillating phase, Ecm is almost entirely converted into thermal
energy (Landau damping). After saturation, a slowly oscillating regime appears, with period
equal to 50ω−1
pe ≈ 5.3 fs. This period is close to the time of ﬂight of electrons traveling at the
Fermi velocity and bouncing back and forth on the ﬁlm surfaces (further details are provided
in our previous work5).

The above nonlinear oscillations appear for all reasonable values of the physical parameters.
Preliminary studies suggest that electron-electron collisions do not destroy this regime either,
at least for relatively low excitation energies and short times. It is tempting, therefore, to
investigate whether some kind of resonant absorption can be achieved when the system is
externally excited at the same frequency of the nonlinear oscillations.

A similar scenario was investigated by Taguchi at al.9 (building on an idea due to Brunel10)
in order to simulate the interaction of an argon cluster with a strong laser ﬁeld (≈ 1015 −
1016 W/cm2). In their simulations, the neutral cluster is quickly ionized by the laser ﬁeld,
which heats the electrons up to 10 eV. At these temperatures, the electrons behave classically
and are initially described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. In that case, the electron
transit velocity through the cluster is not clearly deﬁned and depends on the intensity of the
laser (indeed, in the classical case, there is no “natural” oscillatory regime like the one seen
in Fig. 1). For a degenerate electron gas, the transit velocity is unambiguously given by the
Fermi velocity of the metal and thus we expect an even neater resonance to occur.

Our conjecture can be tested in the following way. At time ωpet = 1000 (≈ 106 fs for a
sodium ﬁlm), when the oscillatory regime is well established, we switch on a small external
electric ﬁeld, uniform in space and sinusoidal in time with period T : Eext = E0 sin(2πt/T ),
where E0 is the (constant) ﬁeld amplitude. The simulation is then continued with the external
ﬁeld on for another 4000ω−1
pe ≈ 425 fs. This situation corresponds to a laser pulse that is
switched on very quickly and lasts for a duration longer than 425 fs.

For an electron transit velocity exactly equal to vF , we would expect resonance for a laser
period T = 2L/vF (= 100 in units of ω−1
pe ). The factor 2 comes from the fact that the electric
ﬁeld must keep the same sign during a transit from one surface to the other, and reverse sign
during the “return” transit. We note that the resonance is expected to fall in the infrared
(IR) domain. Indeed, for a laser period T = 100ω−1
pe = 10.6 fs, the corresponding wavelength
is λ = 3.2 µm.

2ε0E2

The amplitude E0 of the laser ﬁeld can be estimated by noting that the total energy of
the laser pulse is U = (cid:0) 1
0(cid:1) cτ S, where c is the speed of light in vacuum, τ is the pulse
duration, and S is the surface of the laser spot. Typical values for IR lasers11 are S = 0.01mm2
and U = 1µJ, and by taking a pulse duration τ = 400fs (similar to the duration used in the
simulations), we obtain an electric ﬁeld E0 = 4.3 × 108V/m. In the numerical simulations,
the electric ﬁeld is normalized to E ≡ mevF ωpe/e = 1.70 × 1012(rs/a0)−5/2 V/m, yielding
E = 5.31 × 1010V/m for sodium ﬁlms. Therefore, by taking a ﬁeld amplitude E0 = 0.01E, we
get a dimensional value that is realistic for an IR laser pulse. This external ﬁeld amplitude
is an order of magnitude smaller than the self-consistent electric ﬁeld present at the ﬁlm
surfaces.

The results for the reference case (L = 50LF ) are shown in Fig. 2, where the electron
thermal energy is plotted against time. We observe that the absorption is clearly enhanced
for ωpeT = 106 and ωpeT = 150, whereas for larger or smaller values virtually no energy is
absorbed. We also veriﬁed that the resonance does not depend on the phase of the external
oscillating ﬁeld.

The resonant period is close, but not exactly equal, to the predicted value ωpeT = 100

and the resonance displays a certain broadness. The latter can be explained by noting that
a certain dispersion exists in the electron velocities around vF , which generates a dispersion
in the resonant period. If the period is T = 2L/v, then the resonance broadness should be
|δT | = (2L/v2) δv. In order to estimate the broadness, we plot, in Fig. 3, the variation of the
velocity distribution at the center of the ﬁlm: δf (vx) = |fe(x = 0, vx, ωpet = 1000) − fe(x =
0, vx, t = 0)|. The distribution is indeed modiﬁed around the Fermi velocity, as expected (see
also Fig. 3 in Ref. 5). Note that δf is not symmetric around vx = 0, because the initial
excitation was not symmetric either. On closer inspection, the peaks occur at a velocity
slightly smaller (in absolute value) than vF , roughly |vx| ≃ 0.9vF . Their broadness can be
estimated by assuming that a deviation of 2% (relative to the maximum fe = 1) is signiﬁcant.
Then, v varies in the interval 0.7vF < v < 1.1vF (and equivalently for negative velocities), so
that δv ≃ 0.4vF . This yields a broadness ωpeδT ≃ 50, with 90 < ωpeT < 140. This estimate is
compatible with the simulation results of Fig. 2, where the resonance has clearly disappeared
at ωpeT = 73 and 230.

In order to test the robustness of this nonlinear resonance eﬀect, we repeated the same
numerical experiment with a thicker ﬁlm, L = 100LF (the initial evolution for this case is
shown in our previous work5). The resonant period is expected to scale linearly with the ﬁlm
thickness, and indeed we observed enhanced absorption for ωpeT = 212 and 250 (Fig. 4).

In contrast, we observed that the resonance virtually disappears for thicker ﬁlms, L =
200LF or larger. We interpret this result by noticing that the existence of the resonance
depends on nonequilibrium electrons traveling coherently through the ﬁlm. The phase space
portraits of the electron distribution function (see Fig. 3 in our previous work5) show a
complex structure of traveling vortices. It is probable that, for thicknesses larger than a
certain threshold, the necessary coherence is lost, so that the resonance cannot manifest
itself.

The resonance also disappears for very small amplitudes of the external ﬁeld. For the
reference case L = 50LF , the resonance is still observed for E0/E = 0.005, but no longer
for E0/E = 0.001. This may be related to the fact that the absorbed energy at resonance
Uabs scales quadratically with the ﬁeld amplitude: Uabs ∝ e2E2
0T 2/me (this formula becomes
exact for the harmonic oscillator). For small ﬁelds, the resonance is thus very weak and other
factors (e.g., Landau damping) can easily erase it completely.

In summary, we have shown the existence of a nonlinear absorption regime in the electron
dynamics of thin metal ﬁlms. This eﬀect is generic and should not, in principle, depend on
the nature of the metal. The resonance occurs in the IR domain and should be accessible via
experiments employing ultrafast laser sources with standard speciﬁcations. This absorption
mechanism could be used as an optical diagnostic technique to determine, for instance, the
thickness of the ﬁlm, or to obtain information on the electronic distribution.

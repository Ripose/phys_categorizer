The availability of

few-cycle optical pulses
opens a window to physical phenomena occur-
ring on the attosecond time scale.
In order
to take full advantage of such pulses, it is cru-
cial to measure1,2,3,4 and stabilise1,2 their carrier-
envelope (CE) phase, i.e., the phase diﬀerence be-
tween the carrier wave and the envelope function.
We introduce a novel approach to determine the
CE phase by down-conversion of the laser light to
the terahertz (THz) frequency range via plasma
generation in ambient air, an isotropic medium
where optical rectiﬁcation (down-conversion) in
the forward direction is only possible if the inver-
sion symmetry is broken by electrical or optical
means5,6,7,8,9,10. We show that few-cycle pulses
directly produce a spatial charge asymmetry in
the plasma. The asymmetry, associated with THz
emission, depends on the CE phase, which allows
for a determination of the phase by measurement
of the amplitude and polarity of the THz pulse.
The ability to measure1,2,3,4 and stabilise1,2 the CE
phase, which is also often named absolute phase and de-
ﬁned by Eq. 4 (Methods), of few-cycle laser pulses, i.e.,
the ability to completely control ultrashort high-intensity
electromagnetic ﬁelds, provides access to a whole series
of novel physical phenomena, and creates options for
their coherent control. An example is the manipula-
tion of the electron recombination process during “re-
collision”11, with the aim to fully control the generation
of both intense VUV higher-harmonic radiation12,13 as
well as of high-intensity single attosecond pulses. The
progress has led to the establishment of a new ﬁeld
of research, “attosecond science”, with highlights of re-
cent work including the eﬃcient tomography of molecu-
lar wave functions by coherent diﬀraction of rescattered
electrons14 as well as the preparation of high-intensity,
monochromatic femtosecond electron beams evolving
from “bubble generation”15. Many of the phenomena
studied depend critically on the CE phase. Exam-
ples include the dynamics of above-threshold ionisation
(ATI)4, light-induced non-sequential double ionisation16,
Gouy phase observation17, and quantum interference in

photocurrents18. An exciting prospect is the application
of the CE phase as a coherent-control tool, e.g., to steer
bound electrons in molecules19.

The state-of-the-art method for CE phase determi-
nation of ampliﬁed laser pulses is stereo ATI20,21.
In
this letter, we present a new approach based on down-
conversion into the THz frequency range in a laser-
generated ambient air-plasma. The concept relies on the
detection of the THz electromagnetic pulses emitted dur-
ing photo-ionization of the air by the focussed few-cycle
pulses. The method is easy to apply, because it does not
require a vacuum chamber and relies on standard opto-
electronic THz detection technology 5,8.

THz-pulse emission from laser-generated plasmas has
been investigated in the past, but only with much longer
laser pulses. There, the transient electric currents re-
sponsible for the THz radiation have their origin either
in ponderomotive forces22, the Coulomb force of an ex-
ternally applied DC bias5,6, or an optical “AC bias”
achieved by superimposing the light pulses with their own
second-harmonic radiation7,8,9,10. The THz-wave genera-
tion mechanism for the latter has been discussed in terms
of a four-wave-mixing (FWM) process 7,9,10. For the
present case where the pulse spectra are octave-spanning
FWM results in a low-frequency (Ω → 0) polarisation:
P (Ω = ω1 + ω2 − ω3) ∝
I (ω1) I (ω2) I (ω3) cos (ϕCE),
because the CE phases ϕCE of all three input waves are
the same (as all frequency components arise from the
same near-transform-limited few-cycle pulse). The CE
phase is hence directly imparted onto the single-cycle
THz pulse and can thus be determined via electroop-
tic measurement of the THz ﬁeld amplitude. The same
argument concerning the transfer of the CE phase to the
THz ﬁeld can be readily generalised to the case of higher-
order non-linear contributions.
Whilst such a wave-mixing process illustrates the mech-
anism for CE phase-sensitive THz generation, we will
give an alternative description based on static-tunnelling
theory23, which explains the origin of non-linear polarisa-
tion on a microscopic level. For simplicity, we assume the
air to consist only of N2. Figure 1 displays the calculated

FIG. 1: Ionisation rate for N2 vs. electric ﬁeld strength based
on the static-tunnelling theory as a function of the optical
ﬁeld strength, respectively the light intensity. The calculation
was performed with the help of Eq. 1 of Sec. I. An ionisation
−1 corresponds to a probability of 100 % for a
rate of 1015 s
molecule to be ionised during a time interval of 1 fs. Note,
that the probability for ionisation of a molecule has a value
of 1% per fs at a threshold ﬁeld of 3.3·1010 V/m (vertical
black line), and that the ionisation probability per fs already
becomes 100% at 5.5·1010 V/m, i.e., at less than twice the
threshold ﬁeld.

ionisation rate wtun for N2 at a pressure of 1 atm, respec-
tively the ionisation probability rate of a single molecule.
The strongly non-linear intensity dependence of the ion-
isation rate translates into temporal ionisation patterns
as illustrated in Fig. 2. The upper panels display the two
pulse shapes considered here, both with the same pulse
duration of τ = 6 fs (FWHM), the same centre wave-
length of λ = 800 nm, and the same peak electric ﬁeld of
               
opt = 4.2·1010 V/m, but with diﬀerent
the envelope of E0
CE phases, ϕCE = 0 and ϕCE = π/2. The middle panels
of Fig. 2 exhibit the time evolution of the ionisation rates
for the two cases. A common signature is that only the
three or four most intense half-cycles of the pulses ionise
a signiﬁcant amount of molecules. The ionisation rate at
each half-cycle, however, depends sensitively on the CE
phase. This becomes even clearer when we calculate the
temporal evolution of the plasma density. We distinguish
two quantities, ρ+(t) and ρ−(t), which describe the den-
sities of free electrons produced at positive and negative
polarity of the optical laser ﬁeld, respectively. The total
density of free electrons is given by ρtotal = ρ+(t)+ρ−(t).
The lower pair of panels of Fig. 2 shows that for ϕCE = 0,
the total plasma density generated at negative ﬁeld po-
larity is signiﬁcantly smaller than the density for positive
polarity. For ϕCE = π/2, the densities only diﬀer little
after the pulse has passed through the focus.

sities as a function of time for CE phases ϕCE = 0 and
               
ϕCE = π/2. The plasma densities ρ+ and ρ−, generated at
positive respectively negative ﬁeld polarities, are calculated
with Eqs. 2 and 3 of Sec. I. The ionisation threshold is the ar-
bitrarily chosen electric-ﬁeld value where the ionisation prob-
               
ability is 1% per fs.

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               
respondingly, electrons generated at negative polarity
are displaced in the negative direction. Such a collec-
tive charge displacement after the passage of the pulse
(limt→∞(ρ+(t) − ρ−(t)) 6= 0), creates a quasi-DC macro-
               
scopic dipole moment. Because of its transient character,
it acts as the source of an electromagnetic pulse, whose
polarity and ﬁeld amplitude are determined by the ratio
               
R∞
ρ = limt→∞((ρ+ − ρ−)/(ρ+ + ρ−)), a quantity which is
proportional to the maximal generated dipole moment.
A value of R∞
ρ = ±1 corresponds to the highest possi-
ble THz pulse amplitude, with the polarity of the signal
               
depending on the sign of R∞
ρ = 0, THz emis-
sion vanishes. Figure 3 displays R∞
ρ as a function of ϕCE
for laser pulses with Gaussian envelope of various dura-
tions τ . One ﬁnds that the magnitude of R∞
ρ is directly
related to the CE phase with a nearly cosine-like depen-
dence. The contrast, however, rapidly vanishes when the
pulse duration rises towards 10 fs.

Whilst the theory for stereo ATI requires modelling of
both the quiver motion and recollision of electrons, this
is not necessary for THz emission from a plasma gen-
erated at atmospheric pressure. The reason for this is

that the coherent motion of the majority of electrons is
terminated by ultrafast scattering before recollision and
the THz signal is proportional to the asymmetry in the
tunnelling process. Therefore the signal in our method
is conceptually and in contrast to stereo ATI directly re-
lated to the CE phase in a way such that a cosine-like
pulse (ϕCE = 0) will produce a maximum asymmetry in
ionisation rates and also a maximum THz-signal. The
introduced THz method would measure directly the ab-
solute CE phase, if the plasma would be a point object.
However, the plasma is an extended object 24 and we
expect a CE phase variation by dispersion during pulse
propagation and a concomitant interference of the THz
signals generated along the beam path. The strength of
this eﬀect for the moment is unknown, but will be inves-
tigated in future measurements and simulations.

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

An experimental test of these theoretical ﬁndings was
performed by THz-emission spectroscopy with phase-
stabilised 8-fs ampliﬁed laser pulses (see in Methods a
detailed description of the set-up displayed in Fig. 4).
We measured the THz ﬁeld value from a laser-generated
air plasma at a ﬁxed temporal position (that with the
largest amplitude of the THz transients) while continu-
ously varying the CE phase by slowly ramping the set-
point of the control loop (with a slope of 2π per minute).
An exemplary time series spanning 8 minutes is shown
in Fig. 5a. The CE phase data measured in the fre-
quency domain by two f-to-2f interferometers2 (CEP2
and CEP3) are compared to the THz data. The THz sig-
nal varies with the ramped CE phase, as expected from
the model calculations shown in Fig. 3.

               

               

In a second experiment, the CE phase was kept con-
stant in the oscillator and laser ampliﬁer (CEP2), but
varied with the help of a piezo-driven glass-wedge pair
behind the pulse compressor and in front of both the

(also with a phase ramping of 2π per minute). The re-
sults are depicted in Fig. 5b. The measurements again
consolidate the expected change of the THz signal with
varying CE phase.

               

In order to provide a more quantitative analysis of the
               
measurements, we show in Fig. 5c the THz signal as a
function of the CEP3 data (open dots), averaged over a
74-minute time series, where we ramped the phase of the
oscillator as in Fig. 5a. The error bar indicates the stan-
dard deviation of the THz-signal values. The correlation
between THz signal and CEP3 compares well with the
dependence predicted in Fig. 3 for 8-fs pulses (full line
in Fig. 5c). The slight deviation of the theoretical data
from the experimental ones may be a consequence of a
non-Gaussian shape of the envelope.

The status of the THz approach for CE phase determi-
nation can be considered as a proof-of-principle. Never-
theless, to classify its current precision, we compare it to
stereo ATI, which achieves a 3σ error of 100 mrad for 10
seconds of data acquisition and for 6.5-fs 20-µJ pulses 21.
The precision reached with the THz system is 700 mrad

FIG. 5: a) Variation of the CE phase of 8-fs pulses obtained
by slowly ramping the set-point of the control loop. The
CE phase is measured by a f-to-2f interferometer (CEP2)
directly behind the laser ampliﬁer, another f-to-2f interfer-
ometer (CEP3) behind the recompressor, and by the THz
measurement system via electro-optical detection of the THz
radiation generated in an ambient air plasma. The integra-
tion time constant of the lock-in ampliﬁer in the THz mea-
surements was 100 ms.
In addition, a sliding average was
calculated numerically, bringing the eﬀective integration time
constant to 5 sec. Dispersion eﬀects result in an arbitrary
oﬀset between the CE phases measured by CEP2, CEP3 and
the THz system. b) Variation of the CE phase of 8-fs pulses
by a change of the dispersion in the beam path, realised by
two variable glass wedges. c) Adjacent average of the correla-
tion of the CEP3 and the THz data. The window chosen for
averaging was ±0.5 radians of CEP3. For the averaging, the
total data pool recorded within 74 min. is taken into account.
The error bar depicts the standard deviation of this averag-
ing. The solid line shows the results of model calculations of
R∞
ρ for an 8-fs pulse (constant scaling factor between theory
and experiment). The peak electric ﬁeld used for calculations

for 10 seconds of data acquisition for 8-fs 66-µJ pulses.
Considering the factor-of-4 improvement to be achieved
with 6.5-fs instead of 8-fs pulses (see Fig. 3), the THz ap-
proach compares well with the much more mature ATI
method already now. The sensitivity of low-repetition-
rate THz-detection can be enhanced signiﬁcantly by box-
car techniques or by THz interferometry with intensity
detection over a large THz-photon bandwidth.

               

               

               

               

               

               

               

In summary, we report (i) frequency down-conversion
in an isotropic medium without breaking the symmetry
of the non-linear medium by external means, and (ii) CE
phase measurement of sub-10-fs ampliﬁed optical pulses,
both by detection of the THz radiation emitted from a
laser-generated ambient-air plasma. The theory of tun-
nelling ionisation explains the ﬁndings well, in particu-
lar the down-conversion (THz generation) by a spatially
asymmetric process of ionisation and charge acceleration.
THz-emission spectroscopy possesses the potential to be-

come a commonly employed tool for determination and
long term stabilisation of the CE phase for ampliﬁed few-
cycle pulses.

Ionisation model employed in the simulations
We base the quantitative description of the photo-
ionisation process of atoms and molecules on static-
tunnelling theory23, with the following expression for the
ionisation rate:

where ωa = 4.13·1016 1/s is the atomic frequency unit,
Ea = 5.145·1011 V/m the atomic unit of the electric ﬁeld,
and Eopt the optical ﬁeld strength. U H
ion = 13.6 eV and
U N2
ion = 15.6 eV denote the ionisation potentials of atomic
hydrogen and molecular nitrogen, respectively. The sim-
ple tunnelling model is known to describe the experimen-
tal data for N2 well if the intensity of the laser pulses is
above 1014 W/cm2, and to achieve a fair agreement down
to 5·1013 W/cm2 25.

               

Temporal evolution of the ionisation

In order to determine the temporal evolution of the
plasma current, we compute the plasma densities ρ+(t)
and ρ−(t) by solving the following coupled diﬀerential
equations:

               

wtun(Eopt(t)) · (ρ0

gas − ρ+(t) − ρ−(t)),

ρ+(t) =

it is perfectly reasonable for the shortest pulse durations
we consider here.
Light source

The experiments were performed with a light source as
sketched in Fig. 4a. A commercial available Ti:Saphire
Multipass CPA System “Femtopower Compact Pro”
(Femtolasers, Vienna) is seeded with a self-build laser
oscillator (pulse energy 4 nJ, pulse duration 20fs, centre
wavelength 810 nm, CE phase-stabilised with f-to-2f self
referencing1 (CEP1)) and driven at a repetition rate of
2.8 kHz. Its output (500 µJ, 30fs, @805 nm) is focused
into a gas-ﬁlled hollow ﬁbre (inner diameter 200 µm,
length 82 cm, 4.5 bar Neon). A small fraction of the CPA
output (few µJ) are used for a f-to-2f interferometer2
(CEP2) to correct for slow CE phase drifts in the am-
pliﬁer. The ﬁbre output is then compressed to its band-
width limited duration of 8 fs by the use of dispersive
mirrors and a prism-compressor sequence with two fused
silica prisms, with ﬁnal output parameters (83 µJ, 8 fs,
@750 nm (centre wavelength)).

THz-emission spectroscopy system

80% of the ﬁnal output is fed into the THz detection set-

up, which is sketched in Fig. 4b. 10% (the residual 10%
are unused) is used for a third f-to-2f interferometer2
(CEP3), which is tracing CE phase changes for direct
comparison with the THz data in respect to an con-
stant arbitrary oﬀset. The THz system is a typical THz
pump-probe measurement system with balanced electro-
optical THz detection5,8, the whole set-up is ﬁtting on a
30×45-cm2 breadboard. The pump beam is mechanically
chopped at half the laser repetition rate. The plasma is
generated in the focus of an oﬀ-axis paraboloidal mirror
with an eﬀective focal length of 76 mm. For optimi-
sation of the alignment and a ﬁrst determination of the
zero-delay point for the THz detection, an additional DC
bias ﬁeld can be applied to the focal region5. The probe
beam passes along a variable delay line and is focused
collinearly with the THz beam into the electro-optical
ZnTe detector crystal. The THz wave-form as measured
with a DC-biased air plasma is depicted in the lower left
part of Fig. 4b. For the CE phase measurements, the
delay stage of the probe beam is positioned at the zero-
delay point where the strongest THz signal is obtained,
and the external bias ﬁeld is switched oﬀ.

I. INTRODUCTION

Aside from their intrinsic interest, surface electromag-
netic waves (SEW) have recently been proposed [1–4] as
a way to eﬃciently inject light into a photonic crystal
waveguide, or to extract a focussed beam from a chan-
nel. Absent some such mechanism, the insertion and ex-
traction is problematic. In the cited works, the photonic
crystal (PC) was a two dimensional array of rods, of inﬁ-
nite length normal to the plane. In this paper we consider
SEW on a one-dimensional (1D) PC, for which we re-
cently developed accurate semi-classical approximations.
Surface electromagnetic waves on a 1D PC were ob-
served almost 30 years ago [5] [6]. The basic theory
was developed at that time, [7], and can be found in
the monograph of Yariv and Yeh [8]. More recently the
eﬀect of varying the thickness of the termination layer
has been measured experimentally [9,10] and a sensor
based on the properties of SEW’s has been proposed and
demonstrated [11]. In parallel, numerical calculations for
SEW’s in the bandgaps have been performed, and further
aspects of the theory have also been developed [12–15].
Here we study the properties of semi-inﬁnite 1D pho-
tonic crystals with termination layers of various thick-
nesses. The dispersion equation for the SEW’s is well
known [8]. However, exact results can be obtained only
numerically, and to our knowledge, no simple analytic
approximations for them have been developed. Accurate
approximations not only assist in ﬁnding exact solutions,
but also clarify the role of the various parameters deﬁning
the crystal.

Starting from the dispersion equation, we ﬁrst derive
exact expressions for the critical thicknesses at which
SEW solutions appear and disappear. We then intro-
duce approximate analytic forms for the dispersion rela-
tion which are valid in speciﬁed cases. We also apply the
semiclassical method introduced by us in [16] and [17]
to SEW’s. These semiclassical approximations provide
simple and accurate expressions for the bandgap edges.
They also suggest a useful empirical parametrization that
underlies our analytical approximate forms.

For brevity we will discuss only the case of TE waves.

Because our methods are formally quite diﬀerent from
those recently presented in [15], in Section II we provide
a short summary of the transfer matrix approach, in the
notation of our previous work [16]. In Section III we red-
erive the exact equation for SEW and obtain from it var-
ious analytic approximations for a semi-inﬁnite crystal.
With these in hand, we discuss systematics of SEW’s. In
Section IV we apply the semiclassical approximations of
[16] to surface waves, and show that the second approx-
imation is very accurate both for the dispersion relation
and the bandgap boundaries. This lends support to the
parametrization introduced in Section III. In Appendix A
we derive some closed analytic expressions for quantities
introduced in [16] as inﬁnite series. These allow a better
understanding of the role of the various parameters of
the PC.

II. TRANSFER MATRIX APPROACH FOR A
PERIODIC CRYSTAL

We study surface waves of the Tamm type, that form
at the interface between a uniform medium of low refrac-
tive index, n0, and a semi-inﬁnite 1-D photonic crystal,
capped by a termination layer of the same material but
selected width. To clearly separate the periodic bulk from
the remaining surface layer, we split the termination layer
of index of refraction n1 and width dc into two pieces, of
lengths ds + dt = dc. Then the periodic array that makes
the bulk of the crystal consists of “cells” each made of
dt whose
three uniform layers of widths dt, d2 and d1 −
respective refraction indices are n1 , n2 and n1. The
cells are reﬂection symmetric when 2dt = d1. A sketch is
shown in Fig. 1. The initial cell, extending from z = 0
d1 + d2 will be given the index 0, the second
to z = d
index 1, and so on, so that the p-th cell extends from pd
to (p + 1)d and has n(z) = n1 when pd < z < pd + dt
or pd + dt + d2 < z < (p + 1)d and n(z) = n2 when
pd + dt < z < pd + dt + d2. As is customary, we will
suppose n1 > n2 > n0. The rest of the cap layer extends
from z =
ds to 0, and the uniform medium is located
to the left of z =

≡

ds.

We choose a coordinate system in which the layers
have normal vector along OZ. An obliquely incident plane
wave deﬁnes the OX axis. For monochromatic TE waves
the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the OY axis. As in [16], we
write

where ω is the angular frequency, k = ω/c is the vacuum
wavenumber and βk is the (constant) x-component of
the wavevector of modulus k(z) = ωn(z)/c. For a TE
wave entering the 1-D photonic crystal from a uniform
medium, one has

β = n0 sin θ0 ,

(2)

where θ0 is the angle of incidence measured from the
normal. Maxwell’s equations require that in a periodic

Eq. 16 determines the dispersion relation k = k(β) for
the surface waves. It has to be solved numerically, and
we will refer to the solutions thereby obtained as “exact”.
We begin by examining the structure of eq. 16. From
the deﬁnitions of q0 and k1 given above, we see that the
left hand side depends on β, but not on k. Eq. 10 shows

on the r.h.s. of this equation depend on k, while the
others do not.

The term 2πν arises from the inverse of the tangent
appearing in eq. 19. When for a given β and dc = dc,0
the ν = 0 solution is k = k0, one sees easily that k =
k0 is also a solution corresponding to the same β and
dc = dc,0 + νπ/(n1β0 k0), with ν =
. This is
analogous to the well known property of solutions of the
Schr¨odinger equation for a ﬁnite square well potential:
increasing the width of the well by a half-wavelength,
produces a state of the same energy but one additional
node. For simplicity we will focus, from here on, on the
case ν = 0.

If θλ−A was linear or quadratic in k for ﬁxed β, we
could easily solve eq. 23 for k(β,
) in terms of the other
parameters, and so identify the SEW’s. Since that is not
the case, one is reduced to numerical or graphical meth-
ods of solution. To see how this works, we consider an
example in the ﬁrst bandgap, taken from [16]: a PC with
parameters n1 = 2, d1 = 100 nm, n2 = 1.5 and d2 = 250
nm. In Fig. 2 we plot separately the left hand side (con-
tinuous line), and the right hand side for several values
of dc (dashed lines). In the ﬁrst bandgap, sin k2d2 > 0
and therefore we have set φs =
π. As k varies over the
bandgap from kL to kR, the argument θλ−A increases
from
π/2 to π/2. This is a generic feature, as discussed
in [18]. The intersection of any dashed line with the con-
tinuous line deﬁnes a corresponding solution for k. One

−

−

sees that as dc decreases the corresponding k increases,
as expected (think of the analogy with the solutions of
the Schr¨odinger equation). The extreme values of dc for
which a solution exists will therefore be those for which
the r.h.s. of eq. 23 takes the values
π/2. This gives the

In the example shown in the ﬁgure, corresponding to β =
1.2, one ﬁnds dc,min =
27. nm and dc,max = 86.5 nm.
The negative sign merely indicates that there is a surface
wave solution for dc ranging from 0 to dc,max.

−

To proceed further in the analysis of the SEW solutions
requires values for the band edges kL, kR. These will
be obtained from our semiclassical approximation [16] in
Section IV. Before we delve into that, we ﬁrst introduce
an empirical approximation to θλ−A which will be justi-
ﬁed by the semiclassical theory. For the ﬁrst bandgap,
we write

λ−A = sin−1

kL. In Fig. 3 we
with km ≡
compare the exact and the empirical forms of θλ−A for
four values of β ranging from n0 to n2. It can be seen
that the approximation is quite satisfactory.

Based on the above development, we now derive two
analytical approximations for the dispersion relation.
The ﬁrst is valid when the crossing point in Fig. 2 lies in
the linear portion of θλ−A, while the second is valid near
the upper and lower ends of the curve.

A. Solutions in the middle of the bandgap.

These are of particular interest because the damping is
stronger, strongly conﬁning the wave to the surface [9].

In this way we can easily construct k(β) for a ﬁxed value
of dc, or conversely, study k = k(dc) for ﬁxed β. The role
of the bandgap parameters km and w is also quite easy to
analyze. Fig. 4 shows the accuracy of this approximation
when dc = 25 nm. For this example, when β > 1.4 the
approximation ceases to be valid and one has to resort to
other approximations described in the next subsection.

B. Solutions near the bandgap boundaries.

These approximations will be useful in analyzing the
results of experiments like those of Robertson and May
[10], where the SEW’s appear very close to the bound-
aries. As seen in Fig. 3, the linear approximation to
the arcsine fails near the band boundaries. We discuss
solutions near the lower boundary, but similar approxi-
mations can be developed for the upper boundary.

In the second bandgap, Fig. 6 shows that an optical hole
occurs, where the width of the gap shrinks to zero. (See
Section IV and [15] for the exact location.) At the optical
hole, k2d2 = π, giving a change of sign of sin k2d2 at this
critical β = βoh. Correspondingly, one ﬁnds that φs = 0
for β < βoh and φs =
π for β > βoh. The continuous
lines in Fig. 7 show dc,max and dc,min, computed from eq.
33 with ν = 0. The horizontal dashed lines correspond to
various values of dc. The plot shows that for dc = 10 nm,
there is a SEW for β less than approximately 1.25, and
that the SEW reappears for β > βoh. Similarly, for dc =
15 nm there is a SEW when β is less than approximately
1.325, reappearing for β > βoh. For dc = 20 nm SEW
appear for β < βoh, and for β greater than approximately
1.4. Finally, for dc = 40 nm there is a SEW only when
β < βoh.

Fig. 7 shows surface wave solutions when dc = 0.15d1
and dc = 0.40 d1, and conﬁrms the above discussion.
Note that numerically it is rather diﬃcult to locate the
end point of the surface wave solution for dc = 0.15 d1,
because the solutions run very close to the band bound-
ary. In contrast, eq. 33 and the graph Fig. 7 locate that
end point very easily.

5 shows again the validity of this approximation. Note
also that the condition Λ = 0 determines the location of
the zone boundary. Writing it out, one recovers eq. 24,
so that eqs. 31 and 32 do not violate this exact relation.

duced in [16] leads to similar but more involved expres-

Inserting A(2)

presenting these results, we will show the usefulness of
this second approximation in giving accurate values for
the bandgap boundaries.

In eqs. (31) and (32) of ref. [16] we showed that the ﬁrst
approximation provides simple estimates for the bandgap
boundaries. In the second approximation, the condition
γ2 = 0 deﬁnes the band boundaries, because it corre-
sponds to inﬁnite decay length of the surface state. Us-
ing the explicit form of γ2 from eq. (25) of [16], we can
write this condition, for the q-th bandgap boundaries, as

In Fig. 6 we compare the exact bandgap boundaries to
those of eq. 55 and, as can be seen, the latter works very
well except very close to β = n2, where the semiclassical
approximation is expected to fail. For β close to n0 the
values of η are small and one can neglect them in eq. 53.
This leads to simpler forms:

kL = kB −

Neglecting the contribution from r2 we recover the ex-
pressions of the ﬁrst approximation (γ1 = 0) already dis-
cussed in [16].

Direct inspection of the expression for Re(A) derived
from eq. 8 shows that the points where the bandgaps
shrink to zero width correspond to special values of the
optical depths of the layers: k1d1 = m1π, k2d2 = m2π,
with m1, m2 integers. These give

n1,βd1m2 = n2,βd2m1 ,

(58)

and koh = m1π/(d1n1,βoh), in agreement with [15]. The
point where the second bandgap shrinks to zero width, in
Fig. 6, corresponds to m1 = m2 = 1, q = 2. It is easy to

(59)

check that with the above semiclassical approximations
one ﬁnds exactly the same optical hole. Note that at this
critical value

αB = πq

k2d2

(60)

so that r2 = 0, SB = η = 0, and therefore

kL = kR = kB .

C. Results for SEW’s

In Fig. 11 we compare the exact and semiclassical re-
sults for k = k(β), choosing three thicknesses for the cap
layer: dc = dt = 25, 50 and 75 nm. The ﬁrst approxima-
tion becomes inaccurate when β exceeds 1.4, but gives
accurate results up to that value. The second approxi-
mation is so close to the exact values that one can see the
diﬀerence only for values of β very close to the critical
value β = n2 = 1.5. Beyond that, our semiclassical ap-
proximations cannot be applied, since k2 becomes imag-
inary. In the second bandgap, the accuracy of the ﬁrst
approximation is signiﬁcantly worse, whereas the second
approximation is as good as for the ﬁrst bandgap. For
brevity, we do not show any ﬁgures for A and B as func-
tions of k and β. For most of the values in the ﬁrst
bandgap the agreement is similar to that seen in ﬁg. 11
for the dispersion relations.

boundaries and the dispersion relation. We took advan-
tage of this to derive accurate and simple approximations
for the boundaries: eqs. 56 and 57. The ﬁrst approx-
imation already supports the validity of the empirical
parametrization of θλ−A: cf. eqs. 25 and 50.

In conclusion: we have presented a set of analytic re-
sults, exact and approximate, that clarify the systemat-
ics of solutions for surface EM waves in semi-inﬁnite 1D
photonic crystals. In addition, we have found simple ana-
lytic expressions for the bandgap boundaries that should
be useful for the design of PC conﬁgurations. We plan
next to extend our results to layered conﬁgurations with
cylindrical symmetry [20,21]. It would also be interest-
ing to see whether the systematics found here apply to
surface states in 2D and/or 3D photonic crystals.

APPROXIMATIONS

1. Analytic expression for u = v1(0)

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The function v1(z) is deﬁned in eq. 19 of [16] as

By considering the semi-inﬁnite limit of a 1D PC
we have derived a dispersion equation for SEW’s, valid
for termination layers of selected width. Our goal has
been to clarify the systematics of the solutions of this
equation. To do so we ﬁrst discussed a graphical so-
lution. This allowed us to derive analytic expressions
for the critical thicknesses at which solutions appear at
the bandgap boundaries. Further, by introducing a suit-
able parametrization of θλ−A, 25, we have derived simple
approximations for solutions either in the middle of the
bandgap or near the edges: eqs. 26, 31, and 32. We
tested them by an example whose ﬁrst bandgap has no
optical holes. We then extended the analysis of criti-
cal thicknesses to the second bandgap, where there is an
optical hole. The appearance and disappearance of solu-
tions as a function of cap layer thickness is again easily
predicted: eq. 33. For completeness we have also ex-
amined solutions when β > n2, and again found very
simple approximations eqs. 41 and 42, valid over most
of the range n2 < β < n1, that allow us to study the
systematics in a transparent way.

Finally, in section IV, we applied the semiclassical ap-
proximations derived in [16] to SEW’s. The second ap-
proximation is very accurate in predicting the bandgap

FIG. 11. First bandgap: k = k(β) curves for dc = 25, 50 and 75 nm. Continuous lines: exact. Long dashes: ﬁrst approxima-
tion, short dashes: second approximation. The latter curves are so close to the exact ones that the diﬀerence can be seen only
when β > 1.45.

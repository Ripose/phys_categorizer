Abstract:
Since the discovery of backward-wave materials, people have
tried to realize strong chiral medium, which is traditionally thought impos-
sible mainly for the reason of energy and spatial dispersion. We compare
the two most popular descriptions of chiral medium. After analyzing several
possible reasons for the traditional restriction, we show that strong chirality
parameter leads to positive energy without any frequency-band limitation
in the weak spatial dispersion. Moreover, strong chirality does not result
in a strong spatial dispersion, which occurs only around the traditional
limit point. For strong spatial dispersion where higher-order terms of
spatial dispersion need to be considered, the energy conversation is also
valid. Finally, we show that strong chirality need to be realized from the
conjugated type of spatial dispersion.

Introduction

Chirality is ﬁrst referred to a kind of asymmetry in geometry and group theory in mathemat-
ics. The asymmetry exists broadly in organic molecules, crystal lattices, and liquid crystals,
leading to two stereoisomers, dextrorotatory and laevorotatory, as a hot research domain in
stereochemistry. If the two stereoisomers coexist in one molecule (mesomer), or equally differ-
ent steroisomers get mixed (raceme), there will be no special characters other than the common
magneto-dielectric. When we get one pure steroisomer, however, interesting phenomena occur
with an incident linearly-polarized wave, which can be seen as a superposition of two dual
circularly-polarized waves. In case of perpendicular incidence, the two different circularly po-
larized waves have different phase velocities and their polarized planes rotate oppositely. As a
result, the output polarization direction gets rotated, also known as optical activity or natural op-
tical rotation phenomenon, which was ﬁrst observed by Arago in 1811. For oblique incidence,
the two different polarized waves will split even the medium is isotropic, which was veriﬁed
by Fresnel using prism series made from dextrorotatory and laevorotatory quartz [1, 2, 3, 4].
Moreover, in elementary particle physics, chirality and asymmetry also play important roles,
but they are out of the range of this paper.

2. Two major electromagnetic models to describe a chiral medium

The electromagnetic theoretical explanation of optical activity is spatial dispersion [5, 6, 7, 8].
Usually, under the weak spatial dispersion, we use the ﬁrst order (linear) approximation, which
is written as

¯D = e DBF ¯E + e DBF b
¯B = m DBF ¯H + m DBFb

¯E,
¯H.

×

×

Such a representation is named as Drude-Born-Fedorov (DBF) relation for a natural result of
linearly spatial dispersion. Rotation terms are added to the basic constitutive relation, standing
for the spatial dispersion, whose coefﬁcients e DBF b or m DBF b can be either positive or nega-
tive for two stereoisomer structures. Solving the constitutive relation together with Maxwell’s
equations, we can easily get two eigenwaves, which are left and right circularly polarized with
different wavevectors. There are also some other representations, among which the most com-
mon one is deduced by Pasteur and Tellegen as

¯D = e ¯E + (c + ik ) ¯H,
ik ) ¯E,
¯H + (c
¯B = m

−

in which electromagnetic coupling terms are added to the basic terms. Bi-isotropy or bi-
anisotropy is used for calling such constitutive equations, according to the parameters to be
scalars or tensors. If k = 0 and c
= 0, as the

= 0, it is the Tellegen medium; if c = 0 and k

requirement of reciprocity, it is the Pasteur medium:

We pay more attention to such a chiral medium. Positive and negative k values differentiate
two conjugated stereoisomer structures. We assume k > 0 in the following analysis.

Actually, the constitutive relations above are essentially equivalent, with corresponding pa-

rameters to be [7]

It is clear that the parameters are different in such two representations. Then a question may
rise up: which are the “true” material permittivity and permeability? The answer is, both. The
concepts of permittivity and permeability are effective coefﬁcients derived from a mathematical
model. We actually have different mathematical models describing the same physical material.
Thus there are different effective parameters describing the proportion of ¯D to ¯E and ¯B to ¯H.
The rotation terms in DBF model include both real and imaginary parts, resulting in a change
in the real part and creating the imaginary chiral terms in the Pasteur model, vice versa. In
other words, the difference in representations of coupling terms lead to different permittivity
and permeability formulations.

It should be noticed that Faraday gyratory medium can also lead to optical rotation within
the plasma or ferrite under an additional DC magnetic ﬁeld [9, 10]. Hence it is not natural,
and is usually referred as “gyratory”, “Faraday optical rotation”, “magneto-optical effect”, etc.
However, sometimes people do not differentiate “chiral” and “gyratory”. We need pay attention
that such two types of optical rotation have different essence and different characters [10]. Only
natural optical activity is discussed here.

3. Energy and spatial dispersion in strong chiral medium

There is a long dispute on strong chiral medium since it was introduced theoretically [11].
Traditional electromagnetic conclusions have limited us to understand strong chirality, i.e. k 2 >
me
[7, 11], until we see the fact that artiﬁcial Veselago’s medium [12] was successfully realized
in certain frequency bands [13]. Hence, we have to ask the following question: can strong chiral
medium exist?

In Ref. [[8, 11]], the reason for traditional restriction of chirality parameters was concluded
as: 1) The wavevector of one eigenwave will be negative; 2) The requirement of a positive
deﬁnite matrix to keep positive energy:

e

ik

−

(cid:20)

m

.

(cid:21)

(10)

With the exploration of backward-wave medium, we know that negative wavevector, or opposite
phase and group velocities, are actually realizable. And there is an unfortunate mathematical
error in the second reason: in linear algebra, only if it is real and symmetric, positive deﬁnite
matrix is equivalent to that all eigenvalues should be positive. The matrix (10) is a complex one,
making the analysis on restriction of positive energy meaningless.

Actually, in a strong bi-isotropic medium with constitutive relations as Eqs. (5) and (6), the

energy can be drawn as

(11)

Even if the strong bi-isotropic medium is not frequency dispersive, i.e. k 2 > me
for whole fre-
quency range, the energy will still keep positive as long as the permittivity and permeability
are positive, under the weak spatial dispersion condition. This is quite different from the Vese-
lago’s medium since there is no bandwidth limitation and the frequency dispersive resonances
are no longer required. In another word, the strong chiral medium does not contradict the energy
conservation, at least in the weak spatial dispersion model.

Therefore, the real reason for traditional strong-chirality limitation is neither negative

wavevector nor energy conversation. Next we will point out two other important reasons.

First, with the assumption that e > 0, m > 0, k > 0 and k > √me

, we easily show that e DBF ,
m DBF and b
turn to negative from the transformation between Pasteur constitutive relations and
DBF relations shown in Eqs. (7)-(9). This is absolutely unacceptable before people realizing
Veselago’s medium. Actually, strong chiral medium can be equivalent to Veselago’s medium
for the right circularly polarized wave [11, 14]. The negative e DBF and m DBF have shown such
a point. Hence the negative sign in the DBF model is not strange at all, since we realize ef-
fective double-negative with strong chirality parameter instead of simultaneously frequency
resonances. For a limiting case, the chiral nihility [11], in which e
= 0,
the parameters in DBF representation become e DBF
, m DBF
), re-
maining a ﬁnite value after a simple mathematical analysis. There is no evidence that strong
chirality cannot exist in this aspect.

Second, it is the effectiveness of linear models. Similar to the case that linear optical and elec-
tromagnetic models can no longer deal with very strong optical intensity and electromagnetic
ﬁeld, we introduce nonlinear optics to take into account the higher order terms of polarization.
If the spatial dispersion is strong enough, the higher order coupling terms cannot be neglected as
before [7]. People used to mistake strong chirality with strong spatial dispersion, hence adding
a limitation to chirality parameter, k < √me
. We believe that this is the most probable reason.
However, the strong spatial dispersion is embodied in the DBF model, e.g. the value of b
, while
the strong chirality is represented by the Pasteur model, e.g. the ratio of k
. That is to
say, strong chirality does not necessarily lead to strong spatial dispersion.

Based on Eqs. (7)-(9), we have computed b and e DBF /e or m DBF /m versus k /√em

in Figs. 1 and 2. When k

spatial dispersion. Hence the singular point is the very point of traditional limitation. However,
with k continuously increasing, the spatial dispersion strength falls down very quickly. There-
fore, if k
, we need not take nonlinear
terms into consideration at all. Hence the strong spatial dispersion and nonlinearity cannot put
the upper limitation to chirality parameters either.

from the classical nonlinear optics because it is strong spatial dispersion instead of strong ﬁeld
intensity. Hence it is not a power series of ¯E and ¯H ﬁelds.

Nevertheless, the Pasteur relations should remain the form as Eqs. (5) and (6) as long as
the medium is lossless and reciprocal, no matter how strong the spatial dispersion is. The only
thing to be changed is the transform relation between DBF and Pasteur models, which becomes
much more complicated. That is to say, though there are a lot of higher-order rotation terms, ¯D
can still be represented as a real part proportional to ¯E and an imaginary part proportional to ¯H
with modiﬁed coefﬁcients. ¯B has similar representations to ¯D. The nonlinear terms contribute
to the alteration of effective e , m and k
in the Pasteur model, which might be negative, leading

Actually, when introducing higher order terms in the DBF model, e DBF and m DBF will be
altered.Every rotation term includes real and imaginary components, related to ¯E and ¯H, re-
spectively. Comparing to the DBF model, the Pasteur model is relatively stable since its e
stands for the total proportion of ¯D to ¯E. Similar conclusions are valid for m .

Moreover, it has already been shown that any medium satisfying the Lorentz frequency-

dispersive model has positive energy densities.[15] Using the Pasteur relations, we have

in which w′ is the energy density in non-chiral Lorentz medium. Substituting the relation ¯E =
¯H for two circularly polarized eigenwaves into above equations, the last term of Eq. (14)
±
can be cancelled. Hence the energy density remains the same as that in the common Lorentz
medium.

4. Conclusions

From Fig. 1, it is clear that enhancing spatial dispersion will not lead to strong chirality and will
reach the traditional limitation point. This is why we have never succeeded in realizing strong
chirality no matter how to improve the asymmetry and spatial dispersion.

Fortunately, as pointed out earlier, the strong chirality does not require strong spatial dis-
persion. Hence the most important difference between strong and weak chirality is that k and
b have opposite signs, which necessarily leads to negative e DBF and m DBF . Here, k stands for
chirality and b
is the coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst order for spatial dispersion. Strong chirality roots
from using one type of spatial dispersion to get the conjugate stereoisomer, or chirality. It is an
essential condition for supporting the backward eigenwave in strong chiral medium.

In conclusion, a strong chiral medium behaves like Veselago’s medium. Under the weak spa-
tial dispersion, the energy is always positive for chiral medium. We show that strong chirality
does not equal strong spatial dispersion, which occurs only around a singular point. Even in
this small region with very strong spatial dispersion, the Pasteur model is meaningful. Neither
spatial dispersion nor energy will hinder chirality to be stronger, but we cannot realize strong
chirality only by increasing the spatial dispersion. The necessary condition of strong chiral
medium is that the chirality and spatial dispersion are of conjugated types.

We remark that strong chiral media have found wide applications in the negative refraction
and supporting of backward waves, which have been discussed in details in Refs. [14] and
[16]-[21].

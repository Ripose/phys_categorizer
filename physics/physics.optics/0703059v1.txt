We theoretically show how slow light in an optoﬂuidic environment facilitates enhanced light-
matter interactions, by orders of magnitude. The proposed concept provides strong opportunities
for improving existing miniaturized chemical absorbance cells for Beer–Lambert–Bouguer absorption
measurements widely employed in analytical chemistry.

Optical techniques are ﬁnding widespread use in
chemical and bio-chemical analysis, and Beer–Lambert–
Bouguer (BLB) absorption in particular has become one
of the classical workhorses in analytical chemistry [1].
During the past decade, there has been an increasing
emphasize on miniaturization of chemical analysis sys-
tems [2] and naturally this has stimulated a large ef-
fort in integrating microﬂuidics [3, 4] and optics in lab-
on-a-chip microsystems [5], partly deﬁning the emerging
ﬁeld of optoﬂuidics [6, 7]. At the same time, there is
an increasing attention to slow-light phenomena as well
as the fundamentals and applications of light-matter in-
teractions in electromagnetically strongly dispersive en-
vironments [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In this Letter we consider
the classical problem of BLB absorption. As with the
phenomenon of photonic band-edge lasing [13], we show
how slow light in an optoﬂuidic environment facilitates
enhanced light-matter interactions, by orders of magni-
tude, with strong opportunities for improving existing
miniaturized chemical absorbance cells.

The principle of a BLB measurement is illustrated in
panel (a) of Fig. 1 with an optical probe, with intensity
I0, incident on a sample with absorption parameter αl

due to a concentration of some chemical species. Typi-
cally the chemicals will be dissolved in a liquid, but gas
and transparent solid phases are in principle also possi-
ble. Neglecting coupling issues, the transmitted intensity
I will then, quite intuitively, be exponentially damped,
I = I0 exp(γαlL), with L being the optical path length
and γ being a dimensionless measure of the slow-light en-
hanced light-matter interactions. For a uniform medium
of course, we have γ ≡ 1 and the expression is often
referred to as Beer’s law. Since α correlates with the
concentration of the absorbing chemical species, Beer’s
law provides optical means for detecting and quantifying
the concentration of chemical solutions [1]. Obviously,
the eﬀect relies heavily on having a suﬃciently long op-
tical path length and the longer L is the lower a concen-
tration can be monitored for a given sensitivity of the
optical equipment measuring I/I0. Lab-on-a-chip imple-
mentations of chemical absorbance cells are thus facing
almost exhausting challenges since the miniaturization,
i.e. reduction of L, decreases the sensitivity signiﬁcantly.
This problem has already been conﬁrmed experimentally
for lab-on-a-chip systems operated in the visible with L
of the order 100 to 1000 µm [14]. In this work, we show
a route to achieve enhancement factors γ much larger
than unity, thus potentially compensating for the cost of
miniaturization and reduction in optical path length.

In order to explicitly show this phenomenon, we start
from the electromagnetic wave equation for the electrical
ﬁeld,

and consider the case of a weakly absorbing medium
with ǫ = ε + iδε. Since absorption is a weak pertur-
bation, δε ≪ ε, standard ﬁrst-order electromagnetic per-
turbation theory is fully adequate to predict the small
imaginary shift in frequency, ∆ω ∝ iδε. For the unper-
turbed problem, we may obtain the dispersion relation
ω(κ) by solving the wave equation (see method section)
with ǫ = ε. For a ﬁxed frequency, the perturbation iδε
changes into an imaginary shift i∆κ of the wave vector
κ so that the absorption parameter α = 2∆κ becomes
α = k(c/vg)(cid:10)E(cid:12)
E(cid:11), where the electrical ﬁeld
ε(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
is the unperturbed ﬁeld in the absence of absorption,
vg = ∂ω/∂κ is the group velocity, and k = ω/c is the

free-space wave vector. As a reference we consider a
homogeneous liquid with ǫl = n2
l where we have a lin-
ear dispersion ω(κ) = (c/nl)κ with a group velocity of
c/nl and thus αl = kδε/nl. Next, imagine that the dis-
persion is modiﬁed by introducing a non-absorbing (at
least compared to the liquid) material of diﬀerent index
in the liquid, see panels (b–d) in Fig. 1. Compared to the
bare liquid such a composite medium may support an en-
hancement of the eﬀective absorption. The enhancement
factor γ ≡ α/αl can now be expressed as

(cid:12)
0 < f < 1 is restricted to the region containing the ab-
sorbing ﬂuid while the integral in the denominator is spa-
tially unrestricted. This expression clearly demonstrates
how BLB absorption beneﬁts from slow-light phenomena.
For liquid inﬁltrated photonic crystals and photonic crys-
tal waveguides, it is possible to achieve vg ≪ c and at the
same time have a ﬁlling factor of the order unity, f ∼ 1,
whereby signiﬁcant enhancement factors become feasible.

understood in terms of an eﬀective enhancement of the
light-matter interaction time given by the Wigner–Smith
delay time τ . For the homogeneous problem, we have
τl ∼ L/(c/nl) while for the strongly dispersive problem
τ ∼ L/vg so that γ ∼ τ /τl ∝ (c/nl)/vg in agreement with
the result in Eq. (2) rigorously derived from perturbation
theory. The presence of the ﬁlling factor f is also easily
understood since only the fraction f of the light residing
in the ﬂuid can be subject to absorption. These con-
clusions may be extended to also non-periodic systems,
including enhanced absorption in disordered systems as
well as intra-cavity absorbance conﬁgurations, by use of
scattering matrix arguments [15].

Let us next illustrate the slow-light enhancement for
the simplest possible structure; a Bragg stack with nor-
mal incidence of electromagnetic radiation. Panel (a) of
Fig. 2 shows the photonic band structure of an optoﬂu-
idic Bragg stack of period Λ = al + a2 with the low-
index material layers of width al = 0.8Λ being a liq-
uid with refractive index nl = 1.33 while the high-
index layers have a width a2 = 0.2Λ and a refractive
index n2 = 3. Photonic band gaps are indicated by
yellow shading and the dashed line indicates the long-
wavelength asymptotic limit where the Bragg stack has a
meta-material response with a close-to-linear dispersion
ω ≃ cκΛ/(alnl + a2n2). When approaching the band-

gap edges, the dispersion ﬂattens corresponding to a slow
group velocity. It is well-known that the ﬂat dispersion
originates from a spatial localization of the ﬁeld onto the
high-index layers and thus f ≪ 1 near the band edges
where the inverse group velocity diverges. However, in
spite of the localization, the enhancement factor may still
exceed unity as shown in panel (b) where the dashed
line indicates the long-wavelength asymptotic limit with
f ≃ (cid:10)1(cid:12)
In order
(cid:12)
to further beneﬁt from the slow-light enhanced light-
matter interaction, we obviously have to pursue optoﬂu-
idic structures supporting both low group velocity and at
the same time large ﬁlling factors. Fig. 3 shows one such
example where high-index dielectric rods are arranged in
a square lattice. Compared to the Bragg stack, some of
the modes in this structure have both a low group veloc-
ity and at the same time a reasonable value of the ﬁlling
factor f . Particularly the third band in panel (a) is quite
ﬂat and with a ﬁnite f giving rise to an enhancement fac-
tor γ exceeding 5 even at the centre of the band. As in-
dicated on the right y-axis, the enhancement may have a
bandwidth of order 50 nm for a pitch around Λ ∼ 850 nm,
which indeed makes fabrication of such structures real-
istic with state of the art micro and nano fabrication
facilities. As a ﬁnal example, Fig. 4 shows the result of
introducing a line-defect waveguide in such a structure.
The waveguide mode has f ∼ 60% combined with a low
group velocity near the band edges.

For the above numerical results, fully-vectorial eigen-
modes of Maxwell’s equations, Eq, (1), with periodic
boundary conditions were computed by preconditioned
conjugate-gradient minimization of the block Rayleigh
quotient in a planewave basis, using a freely available
software package [16]. For the resolution, we have used a
basis of 210 plane waves for the 1D problem in Fig. 2 and
210 × 210 plane waves for the 2D problem in Fig. 3. In
Fig. 4 we have used a resolution of 27×27 and a super-cell
of size 1 × 7.

In the above examples we have for simplicity consid-
ered dielectric constants corresponding to semiconductor
materials suitable for the near-infrared regime. How-
ever, we would like to emphasize that applications ex-
ist also in the visible, mid-infrared, far-infrared, and
even the microwave and sub-terahertz regimes. The pre-
dicted enhancement of light-matter interactions makes
liquid-inﬁltrated photonic crystals obvious candidates
for improving existing miniaturized chemical absorbance
cells. Previous work on liquid-inﬁltrated photonic crys-
tals [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] has focused on the solid type with
liquid inﬁltrated voids illustrated in panel (d) of Fig. 1,
while we in this work have focused on rod-type photonic

crystals which have the technological strong advantage
that they are permeable to an in-plane liquid ﬂow, thus
making them integrable with micro-ﬂuidic channels in
planer lab-on-a-chip technology.

In conclusion, we have studied the potential of us-
ing liquid-inﬁltrated photonic crystals to enhance Beer–
Lambert–Bouguer absorption. The slow-light enhance-

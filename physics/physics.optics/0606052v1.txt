Enhanced transmission of slit arrays in an extremely
thin metallic ﬁlm

Abstract

We explore the behaviour of slit arrays for very low thicknesses and found that
they could constitute very interesting ﬁlters. Two mechanisms are responsible for the
enhanced transmission depending on the thickness : ﬁrst, cavity resonances, for a
suprisingly low thickness and a resonance whose nature still has to be understood for
extremely small thicknesses.

Since the discovery of Ebbesen that subwavelength hole arrays could transmit
light,[1] much has been understood concerning the behaviour of such structures. Reso-
nances of the structure are responsible for the extraordinary transmission. Two types of
resonances are usually involved : surface resonances (plasmons) for bidimensional hole
arrays[3, 4] and cavity resonances, for slit arrays[2, 5, 6, 7] and coaxial hole arrays[9, 10].
This paper deals with the case of subwavelength slit arrays, which have attracted
much attention[2, 6] and are quite well understood[3, 7]. The enhanced transmission
is explained for these structures by cavity resonances : the propagative mode inside
the slits is excited and each slit behaves like a cavity because the mode is reﬂected on
the upper and on the lower side. The transmission is then very well approximated by
a one-mode model[5, 7].

Our purpose is to study the behaviour of such structures for very small thicknesses.
Since the resonances involved in the transmission are cavity resonances, other authors
do not expect such resonances to occur below a given depth of the slits[2, 3, 7], and
no resonance of the structure is of course expected when the one-mode approach is
not valid any more. The lower limit for a perfect validity of the one-mode approach is
thought to be around one third of the wavelength[7].

We have found that cavity resonances occur for surprisingly low thicknesses and
that the one-mode approach can be considered as relevant in this case. In addition,
we have found that another type of resonance may occur for extremely thin structures
when many evanescent Bloch waves have to be taken into account.

The geometrical parameters of the structure are its thickness h, its period d and
the width of the slits, a. The structure is represented ﬁgure 1. The metal considered
here is silver. The optical constants of silver are taken from [11].

Let us recall the one-mode approach of the transmission of the slits array. Each
slit can be considered as a waveguide. For a slit width smaller than the wavelength,
there is only one propagative mode in the slit. In consequence, there always exists a
propagative Bloch mode in an array of slits. This mode corresponds to the excitation of
the guided mode in each slit. The assumption that only the propagative Bloch mode is
responsible for the extraordinary transmission leads to a classical Fabry-P´erot formula
for the zero-order transmittance of the whole structure [2, 7]:

guided mode and λg its eﬀective wavelength (which is close to the real wavelength).
The coeﬃcient t0 is the transmission coeﬃcient between the incident wave and the
propagative Bloch mode, while t1 is the transmission coeﬃcient between the propaga-
tive mode and the plane wave (sse ﬁgure 1). When there are no losses t0 = t1 due to
reciprocity. Here, t0 and t1 slightly diﬀer from each other. Finally, r is the reﬂection
coeﬃcient of the guided mode inside the slits. The propagation constant and all these
coeﬃcients are computed using a Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis[12, 13].

(1)

A cavity resonance occurs when the denominator of (1) is close to zero. This is the
case when two conditions are fulﬁlled. First the modulus of r must not be null, and as
close to 1 as possible, which is fulﬁlled as soon as λ > d. Second, if we denote φ the
phase of r, the resonance condition can be written

φ(λ) − β h = m π

(2)

where m is an integer. When the reﬂexion coeﬃcient is real, the condition (2) cannot
be fulﬁlled if h is smaller than λg
2 . But it can be fulﬁlled for very low h if either the
phase is close to zero but positive with m = 0 (we will label the associated resonance
0+), or if it is close to −π but greater than −π with m = −1 (the resonance being
labelled π+).

Figure 2 shows a typical internal reﬂexion coeﬃcient r for a period d = 600 nm and
a slit width a = 100 nm. In order to understand the behaviour of the structure, we
will perform an analysis using the zeros and the poles[7] of the diﬀerent coeﬃcients in
equation (1).

At λ ≃ 568 nm an almost real zero of r can be seen. For this wavelength the
transmission does not depend on the depth h of the slits. At λ ≃ 618 nm there is a
pole of r. Of course, this pole is rather far from the real axis because the modulus
of r must remain smaller than one. It can be seen that the phase goes from −π to a

ﬁnite and positive value between the zero and the pole of the reﬂexion coeﬃcient. It
is null for λ ≃ 608 nm. Considering the phase only, both 0+ and π+ resonances may
thus occur between the zero and the pole for very low values of h.

Let us consider the case of the 0+ resonance. The modulus of r is close to 1 for
λ > d because of the presence of the pole. This means that the denominator of (1)
can be very close to zero. Since the transmission given by (1) must remain ﬁnite, the
product t0 t1 presents a zero at exactly the same wavelength[6, 7]. This wavelength
corresponds to the surface plasmon excitation condition

where ǫ is the permittivity of silver. For d = 600 nm we ﬁnd that the wavelength at
which the surface resonance is excited is λp = 618 nm. In the case of the slits array,
the surface resonance can be seen as two counter-propagative surface plasmons which
interfere destructively above the slits. That is why this mode is not sensitive to the
presence of the slits and why the position of the zero of t0 t1 does not depend on the
width of the slits[7]. Finally, because of the presence of this zero, the 0+ resonance
cannot occur for a very small thickness.

An optimization using a genetic algorithm has been performed in order to see
if this structure can be considered as a good monochromatic ﬁlter at λ = 600 nm.
The objective function which is minimized is simply |1 − T (600)| + T (400) + T (750).

monochromatic ﬁlter.
The zero order transmittance spectrum of the obtained structure (d = 505 nm, a =
115 nm, h = 125 nm) is shown ﬁgure 3. Even if the resonance provides a very intense
transmission, the slits are so wide that the propagative mode is easily excited. Finally,
the transmission is quite high at any wavelength (except near the plasmon resonance).
The one-mode approach is perfectly valid for these conditions.

Figure 3: Zero-th order transmission of a structure with d = 505 nm, a = 115 nm and
h = 125 nm (solid line). The comparison is made with the prediction of the one-mode
model, which is found to be very accurate. The peak at 505 nm is a peak of t0 t1 that can
be found when λ = d.

Let us now consider the π+ resonance. For slits larger than 70 nm this resonance
cannot occur because in the range where the phase is close to −π, r has a zero. But
when the slits becomes smaller, the zero is heading towards the pole located at λp (see
ﬁgure 4). It goes oﬀ the real axis, so that the minimum of |r| is no longer zero. There
is no major change in the behaviour of the phase : it is equal to −π at the minimum of
|r|. Some minor changes occur, though : the phase varies slower near the zero so that
for very thin structures the condition on the phase (2) is veriﬁed somewhat further
from the zero, in a range where the modulus of r is greater. Finally, a phase close to
−π can be found when |r| is not too small if the width of the slits is small enough. A
π+ cavity resonance can thus be expected for narrow enough slits for extremely low
thicknesses, as long as the one-mode assumption (on which this prediction relies) is
still valid. Because the phase varies very rapidly near the zero of r, the transmission
peak linked to the π+ resonance is expected to be very narrow. As far as we know, this
resonance has never been studied in previous works[2, 6, 5, 7] maybe because all authors
expect enhanced transmission to occur for λ > d and for wide enough slits[2]. Another
reason is that previous works deal with lower frequencies at which the permittivity
of silver is higher, so that the zero and the pole of r are much too close and the π+
resonance cannot be excited.

When the thickness is large enough, both the 0+ and the π+ resonances can be seen
on the same transmission spectrum (see ﬁgure 5). As expected, the one-mode model
gives excellent results in this case.

We have performed the same optimization than for the 0+ resonance, except that
we have imposed a < 70 and a period d much closer to 600 nm. The obtained structure
has a period of 600 nm, a slit width of a = 45.5 nm and a thickness of only 60.5 nm. The
π+ resonance is shown ﬁgure 6. It can be seen that the one-mode approach is correctly
predicting the position, the width and the intensity of the enhanced transmission even

if this is not the case at other wavelengths. That is why we think that the peak in
the transmission spectrum can be considered as a cavity resonance, but with a 60 nm
thick only cavity - which is surprising.

Even if this resonance is clearly a cavity resonance, it is excited when the trans-
mission coeﬃcients t0 and t1 reach a peak, at exactly 600 nm. The fact that these two
phenomenon coincide is due to the optimization : the best possible resonance is clearly
found when the cavity resonance and the peak of t0 t1 occur at the same wavelength.
When it is not the case, the transmission is of course not as high as in the previous
case.

When the thickness becomes even smaller, the role of the evanescent waves cannot
be neglected any more. They can be responsible for the transmission. Surprisingly,
we found that at extremely low thicknesses an enhanced tranmission is still observed
for λ = d. It cannot be explained using the one-mode model (see ﬁgure 7). Since it
occurs for a wavelength equal to the periodicity of the array it does not seem that is
can be linked to the plasmon resonance. Until now, we have no explanation for this
resonance.

In conclusion, we can say that the behaviour of slit arrays at very small thick-
nesses has been explored. Let us ﬁrst underline that, although the surface plasmon
resonance hinders the excitation of cavity modes, its existence is responsible for the
unusual behaviour of the structure. The phase and the modulus of the internal reﬂex-
ion coeﬃcient for the Bloch mode, r, are indeed determined by the position of the pole
and the zero linked to the plasmon resonance. And the exotic behaviour of the phase
allows the excitation of cavity resonances for thicknesses as small as one tenth of the
wavelength in vacuum. Using optimization techniques, we have found some structures
could constitute very interesting ﬁlters.

For even thiner structures, the one-mode approach is not valid any more but an
enhanced transmission is still observed when the wavelength is equal to the period. It
cannot be explained using the one-mode approach, and it does not clearly correspond
to a plasmon resonance. The exact nature of this resonance is still an open problem.

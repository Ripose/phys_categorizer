We present a comparative overview of existing laser beam proﬁling methods. We compare the
the knife-edge, scanning slit, and pin-hole methods. Data is presented in a comparative fashion.
We also elaborate on the use of CCD proﬁling methods and present appropriate imagery. These
methods allow for a quantitative determination of transverse laser beam-proﬁles using inexpensive
and accessible methods. The proﬁling techniques presented are inexpensive and easily applicable to
a variety of experiments.

INTRODUCTION

How large or how ”good” a particular laser beam is,
can seem like an inﬁnitely abstract question since a laser
beam fades gradually. However, comparing the eﬀects of
an expanded laser beam striking a piece of paper with
burning a piece of paper with the same focused laser
beam brings across the notion that the beam size can
make a diﬀerence in many physical scenarios. Of course,
questions on which methods are appropriate to determine
beam quality, divergence and size arise immediately in
these types of discussions.

It is a valuable exercise to agree on some type of quan-
titative deﬁnition of a laser beam radius. The standards
which the scientiﬁc community has agreed upon can then
be discussed in a meaningful way.

In general, the irradiance, I(x, y), of an ideal laser
beam displays a Gaussian proﬁle as described by Chapple
[1]:

I(x, y) = I0 exp

2((x

−

x0)2 + (y
r2

−

y0)2)

−

(cid:20)

(1)

,

(cid:21)

where I0 is the peak irradiance at the center of the beam,
x and y are the transverse (cross-sectional) cartesian co-
ordinates of any point with respect to the center of the
beam located at (x0, y0), and r is the 1/e2 beam radius.
The deﬁnition above assumes a Gaussian distribution for
the electric ﬁeld commonly used in theory. When the
electric ﬁeld expression[2] is squared we end up with a
factor of 2 in the exponent as shown in Eq. (1). It be-
comes clear from Eq. (1) that at the radius, r, the ir-
radiance drops to 1/e2 of its peak value. The Gaussian
distribution of the irradiance can also be deﬁned as given
by McCally [3]:

I(x, y) = I0 exp

In this case, the beam radius, R, is reached when the
irradiance drops to 1/e of its maximum value as shown
in Fig. 1. Note that the beam radius, r, in Eq. (1) is √2
times larger than R.

FIG. 1: The Gaussian beam proﬁle of the irradiance, I, is
displayed in this two dimensional ﬁgure as a function of x.
The 1/e2 beam radius, r, as well as the 1/e beam radius, R,
are indicated.

We will use the deﬁnition given by Eq. (1) for the beam

radius, r, in this paper.

We can simply replace the irradiance, I, by the power,
P, in equations (1) and (2), since power and irradiance
diﬀer only by a constant factor, i.e., the area. This real-
ization comes in handy during measurements.

The measurement of Gaussian laser beams can be chal-
lenging even though the deﬁnitions for the size of Gaus-
sian beam are clear.[4–7] The challenge in measuring
a Gaussian beam proﬁle lies in the nature of the laser
light and the properties that are to be determined, i.e.,
whether the experimentalist is interested in the size of
the beam or the beam structure. There are a variety
of methods available to measure the properties of Gaus-
sian laser beams. In this paper, we will present a conve-
nient overview of commonly used beam-proﬁling methods
based on the nature of the laser light and the experi-
mental limitations. The data presented here allows for
qualitative and quantitative comparison of the various
beam-proﬁling methods.

KNIFE-EDGE METHOD

The knife-edge method is a beam proﬁling method that
allows for quick, inexpensive, and accurate determina-
tion of the cross-sectional laser beam parameters. The
knife-edge method requires a sharp edge (typically a ra-
zor blade), a translation stage with a micrometer and
a power meter or an energy meter when working with
pulses. The knife-edge is translated perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the laser beam. With the
knife-edge initially covering the laser beam, the microme-
ter can be adjusted in appropriate increments. Each data
point will show an increase in total power, P T , passing
by the knife-edge until the entire beam is detected by the
power meter at power P T 0 as shown in Fig. 2. The plot
shows then the two dimensional Gaussian proﬁle inte-
grated over the displacement of the razor blade, x, which
is the Error function, erf (x), describing the total power,
P T , bypassing the knife edge:

P T (x) = P0r

There are several ways to evaluate the 1/e2 radius us-

ing this type of data:

1. Fitting the Error function and evaluating ﬁtted pa-
rameters in accordance with Eq. (3). This is, how-
ever, a more involved procedure based on the math-
ematical nature of the error function, we do not
recommend a ﬁt to the error function for practi-
cal reasons and for quick results. We reserve the
discussion of this method for another paper.

2. Taking the derivative of the data using an algo-
rithm that allows for smoothing of the derivative is
practical. In this case, the derivative at any data
point was taken by averaging the derivative of two
adjacent data points:

FIG. 2: (a) A Coherent Verdi laser was used for the collection
of this sample data. The total power, PT , passing by the
knife-edge is shown as a function of knife-edge displacement.
(b) The derivative of the knife-edge data is found by using
Eq. (4). The 1/e2 radius, r, is 1270µm ± 20µm.

gives the power at a particular point x in the beam
as shown in Fig 2b. This type of derivative may be
taken quickly by using spreadsheets. The students
then have two options of ﬁnding the 1/e2 radius, r:

(a) One can simply estimate by dividing the max-
imum value in the derivative plot by e2 and
ﬁnding the corresponding r value by linear ex-
trapolation between points.

(b) Alternatively, a Gaussian can be ﬁt to the data
in Fig 2b using one of the widely available data
analysis programs. This will also allow for a
quick assessment of the experimental error as-
sociated with this ﬁt. We used Origin 7.5 in

It is then instructive to compare
this case.
these results with the method described in 2a.

A few data points are suﬃcient to determine the size
of a Gaussian laser beam to very high accuracy, limited
by the resolution of the translation stage and the stabil-
ity of the laser. Using a relatively inexpensive mechani-
cal micrometer, the resolution can be 2µm or better[8].
Diﬀraction does not have a signiﬁcant impact since the
light does not spread signiﬁcantly after passing the knife-
edge. The knife-edge can therefore ﬁt in easily at any
point an optical set-up while the detector can be con-
veniently placed after the knife-edge, depending on the
spatial conﬁguration of the setup.

A drawback of the knife-edge method is the lack of re-
solved features in the resulting beam-proﬁle. Since we

are measuring the integral of the Gaussian beam, fea-
tures such as hot-spots disappear. Taking too many data
points can be a disadvantage since any noise will be am-
pliﬁed by taking the derivative. Keeping the number of
data points to a minimum will ensure a smoother ﬁt.
Methods allowing for a more detailed examination of the
beam-proﬁle are discussed in the following sections.

SLIT METHOD

Using a slit to obtain a beam proﬁle can be achieved
by simply replacing the Knife-Edge in section by a nar-
row slit. We used a 7µm slit to conﬁrm the data we
obtained with the knife-edge. Since we obtain the same
error for the 1/e2 radius, r, for both methods, we see that
in this case most of the error originates from instabilities
in the laser beam independently of the method chosen,
i.e., more accurate results can only be obtained with a
more stable laser.

The slit method assumes that the slit is inﬁnitely nar-
row so that we can map the power transmitted through
the slit at any point of the proﬁle. We can therefore use
the slit as long as it is much narrower than the beam.
The data can then be plotted directly as shown in Fig. 3.

FIG. 3: The same Coherent Verdi laser used in the knife-
edge measurement was used for the collection of this sample
data. The power, P , passing through a 7µm slit is shown as a
function of slit displacement. The 1/e2 radius, r, is found to
agree with the results reported in section (1270µm ± 20µm).

s is the width of the slit.

0s is the uncorrected size of the beam waist, and

Even though slits are most appropriate for large
beams, care must be taken that the results are not dis-
torted by the beam exceeding the longitudinal dimension
of the slit. Diﬀraction is not an issue as long as the de-
tector is positioned close enough to the slit to collect the
light after passing through the slit before it spreads be-
yond the dimensions of the detector. A lens can be used
right after the slit to collect the diﬀracted light if the
detector cannot be placed immediately after the slit.

Finally, the slit method may be impractical when mea-
suring low power beams since only a very narrow slice of
the laser beam passes through the slit. This power drop
becomes evident when comparing Figs. 2 and 3.

As with the Knife-Edge method, the Slit method does
not reveal beam proﬁle features like hot spots. However,
these methods are most practical for determining the size
of a Gaussian laser beam.

PINHOLE METHOD

The pinhole method allows the user to scan across a
laser beam and record the irradiance at every point. This
technique allows for the collection of a highly resolved
beam proﬁle. Hot spots and other beam features can
then be detected. Intensity distributions across a laser
beam become critical for experiments involving optical
non-linearities.

Traditionally slits have been used as a proﬁling method
when the slit width is much smaller than the beam itself
as it is the case in our example. Nevertheless, a slit may
also be used when the slit width is about the same size
as the laser beam when measuring the beam waist, w0,
of a focused beam as Chapple[1] has shown:

FIG. 4: The same Coherent Verdi laser beam was probed
for the collection of this sample data. Diﬃculty in locating
beam center and the exact location of the pinhole inside the
BeamProﬁler by Photon Inc., contributed to the systematic
error which resulted in a measured beam width of 1110µm ±
10µm deviating from the results of sections and .

The beam proﬁle in Fig. 4 was obtained using an com-

puter controlled pinhole by Photon Inc. It is impractical
to mount a pinhole on a translation station and take the
data manually as we did when we used the knife-edge or
slit. It is more advantageous to use the pinhole in an au-
tomated system that allows for quicker data collection.
In our case, the pinhole and sensor are contained in one
unit so that the exact position of the pinhole and sen-
sor could not be located easily. Also, there is no insight
into the mechanism of determining the beam center for
the horizontal sweep of the pinhole resulting in another
possible source of systematic error. These two system-
atic errors account for a beam width of 1110µm
10µm
deviating from the results in sections and by 160µm.
The light passing through the pinhole is signiﬁcantly
reduced in intensity compared to the slit and therefore
even harder to detect and more prone to poor signal to
noise ratio issues. It should be noted that it can be diﬃ-
cult to sweep exactly across the center of the laser beam.
The beam can thus appear smaller than it really is.

CCD CAMERAS

Quick qualitative analysis of transverse laser beam pro-
ﬁles can be achieved through the use of CCD cameras as
shown in Fig. 5. Visual inspection of this beam proﬁle
reveals not only an almost elliptical shape but also other
irregularities in the proﬁle.

FIG. 5: CCD image of CW Verdi laser beam. The image
reveals a somewhat elliptical shape that shows a combination
of modes. Artifacts from due to interference are visible.

There are many diﬀerent types of CCD cameras avail-
able. The resolution of a CCD camera is governed by
pixel-size and number of pixels. An adjustable dark cur-
rent can prevent the CCD camera from saturating with-
out the use of attenuators. An inexpensive digital cam-
era can also be used to capture a beam proﬁle as long
as the beam is carefully attenuated to prevent satura-
tion or damage to the camera. It should be noted that
attenuation tends to distort the beam proﬁle and beam
size. High-intensity or pulsed lasers may introduce non-

4

linearities in experimental camera optics leading to a dis-
torted beam proﬁle. Interference eﬀects originating from
dust and the use of a neutral density ﬁlter are visible in
Fig. 5 and should not be confused with beam features.

CREATING A BEAM MAP

The knife-edge method can even be used to determine
beam overlap and relative beam propagation when using
several beams. Also, beam divergence can be determined
by measuring the beam radius at various points along the
beam path. The type of beam propagation data shown in
Fig. 6 is useful in many research projects or may simply
be used to demonstrate Gaussian beam propagation in
an undergraduate laboratory.[2]

CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated the reliability of the knife-edge
and slit beam-proﬁling methods in determining the size
of a Gaussian laser beam by presenting the identical re-
20µm for the beam radius for both
sults of 1270µm

methods whereas the pinhole method shows deviations
as presented above. Furthermore, we have presented two
beam proﬁling methods, the CCD array and the pinhole
method, in evaluating beam quality. There are many
sophisticated beam proﬁling instruments that are com-
mercially available. Nevertheless, beam proﬁles can be
obtained eﬀectively with modest resources. Most of the
commercially available beam proﬁlers are based on the
principles outlined in this paper. Under certain circum-
stances, it can certainly be convenient and a time saver
to purchase a beam proﬁling system.

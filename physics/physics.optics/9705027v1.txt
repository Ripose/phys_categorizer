Emitting Lasers

We present a generalized rate equation model for the array
and polarization dynamics of general one or two dimensional
arrays of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs).
It is demonstrated that our model includes both the previous
theory for edge emitting laser arrays and the theory of polar-
ization dynamics in quantum well VCSELs in a single uniﬁed
description. The model is based on the physical assumption
of separated carrier densitiy pools individually coupled to dif-
ferent light ﬁeld modes. These modes, deﬁned by the sepa-
rate gain proﬁle of each pool, interact through the coherent
dynamics of the light ﬁeld derived from Maxwell’s equations
and represented by the coeﬃcients for index and loss guiding.
The special case of two densities and two light ﬁeld modes
is solved and the implications of the results for large VCSEL
arrays are discussed. Our analytic results show that typical
solutions of the split density model range from phase locking
to chaos, depending on the magnitude of the frequency coef-
ﬁcients. For weak coupling, the stable supermode is always
the mode of highest frequency. This indicates that anti-phase
locking is the only stable phase locking possible in arrays.

I. INTRODUCTION

If vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are
fabricated in the form of a densely packed two dimen-
sional array as shown in Fig.1, their highly symmetric
geometry around the axis of emission calls for an inves-
tigation of both polarization dynamics and laser array
interactions. Previously these two aspects have been
treated separately. Experimental investigations of VC-
SEL arrays [1–3] usually cite theories derived for the one
dimensional case of side-by-side edge emitting laser ar-
rays such as the theory introduced by Winful and Wang
in 1988 [4]. On the other hand, a model for the descrip-
tion of polarization dynamics in individual VCSELs was
introduced by San Miguel, Feng and Moloney in 1995 [5].
Both models are rate equation models for type B lasers.
Adiabatic elimination of the dipole density is used to re-
duce the description of the electronic system to carrier
densities. However, the similarity does not end here.
In both models, the carrier density is split into sepa-
rate pools, each of which couples to a diﬀerent light ﬁeld
mode. The diﬀerences between the models arise only
from the choice of parameters which describe the dynam-
ics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the diﬀusive exchange
of carriers between the carrier density pools.

Since the physical assumptions of the models for polar-
ization and array dynamics are so similar, we will show in
the following that indeed a general model for the polariza-
tion and array dynamics of arbitrary VCSEL arrays can
be formulated. The coeﬃcients of this generalized split
density model will then contain all the information nec-
essary to describe any special case. Therefore, the choice
of the coeﬃcient, which describe the physical properties
of the device studied, is critical and a good understand-
ing of the microscopic physics from which they can be
derived is necessary to distinguish between common and
exotic cases.

In section II, the physical justiﬁcations for introducing
split densities in both the polarization and the array dy-
namics is discussed. Parameters for carrier diﬀusion and
scattering are approximated. In section III, we present
the general formalism of the split density model. The
coeﬃcients derived from Maxwell’s equations are intro-
duced and discussed. In section IV, the special case of
two densities and two light ﬁeld modes is treated. Fixed
points and limit cycles are analytically calculated. In sec-
tion V, our analytic results of the two density model are
applied to large arrays. A stability analysis is presented
and conditions for chaotic dynamics are discussed.
In
section VI, we conclude by discussing the strengths and
weaknesses of the split density model as the basis of a de-
scription for general semiconductor laser array dynamics.

II. THE PHYSICAL JUSTIFICATION OF SPLIT
DENSITIES

A. Polarization dynamics: separation of carrier
density pools by angular momentum

In quantum well VCSELs, the axis of symmetry of
the quantum well structure is identical to the axis of
laser light emission. Therefore, the conservation of an-
gular momentum may be applied to describe the emis-
sion process. Photons with an angular momentum of +1
(right circular polarized light) may only be emitted by
electron-hole pairs with a total angular momentum of
+1 and photons with an angular momentum of -1 (left
circular polarized light) may only be emitted by elec-
tron hole pairs with a total angular momentum of -1. If
only the bands closest to the fundamental gap are con-
1/2
sidered, electrons have an angular momentum of

±

1

and holes have an angular momentum of
3/2. Conse-
quently, electrons with an angular momentum of +1/2
may only recombine with holes of -3/2 angular momen-
tum, emitting left circular polarized light. Electrons with
an angular momentum of -1/2 may only recombine with
holes of +3/2 angular momentum, emitting right circular
polarized light.

±

Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the
carrier density is therefore split into a carrier density
emitting only right circular polarized light and a car-
rier density emitting only left circular polarized light.
This eﬀect was ﬁrst included in a rate equation model
by San Miguel and coworkers in [5]. In that model, it is
assumed that the two densities interact by spin ﬂip scat-
tering processes which give rise to a diﬀusive exchange
of carriers between the two densities. Experimental in-
vestigations of quantum well structures indicate that this
scattering rate is of the order of 1010s−
1, similar to the
carrier recombination rate [6]. The assumption of split
densities should therefore be well justiﬁed if the separa-
tion of bands in the quantum well structure is suﬃcient
to exclude the participation of higher bands in the laser
process.

B. Array dynamics: spatial separation of carrier
density pools

In a typical semiconductor laser array, carriers are
injected into spatially separated regions of the active
medium. If the distance of separation is suﬃciently large,
gain guiding eﬀects will give rise to spatially separated
optical modes, each associated by the gain function with
its own carrier density pool. The localized modes are
then coupled by Maxwell’s equations, since the evanes-
cent parts of the neighbouring optical modes overlap.

The rate equation theory for laser arrays of this type
was developed by Winful and Wang in 1988 [4]. However,
in that early formulation, carrier diﬀusion is completely
neglected. To check the justiﬁcation of that assump-
tion, we need to estimate the time it takes carriers to
diﬀuse from one localized carrier density pool to a neigh-
bouring one. Noting that the microscopically computed
ambipolar diﬀusion constant of charge carriers in GaAs
based lasers is typically about 1µm2/ns = 10 cm2/s [7],
we can estimate the diﬀusive carrier exchange rate be-
tween lasers separated by a few micrometers to be close
to 1010s−
1, similar to the spin relaxation rates expected
for the polarization dynamics. However, the carrier ex-
change rates depend on the square of the distance be-
tween the lasers, which implies that the split density
model rapidly loses its validity as the separation between
elements of the array is reduced. In order to investigate
the eﬀects of diﬀusion, the possibility of carrier exchange
between the densities is included in the generalized split
density model presented in III.

In this model, carrier diﬀusion is described in terms of
a carrier exchange rate. Of course, this is just a crude

approximation of the real physical process of continuous
diﬀusion which is quite diﬀerent from the spin ﬂip scat-
tering involved in the carrier exchange between carrier
density pools of diﬀerent angular momentum. However,
as long as the light ﬁeld is only sensitive to the average
carrier density within one laser of the array and higher
transversal modes are neglected, the overall eﬀect of dif-
fusion can be summarized in a single carrier exchange
rate.

We cannot but note that some of the coupled mode the-
ories frequently cited use the assumption of homogeonous
and stationary gain, ignoring the dynamical eﬀects of
spatially resolved carrier densities altogether [1,3,8–10].
In type B lasers, that assumption is only valid at the
ﬁxed points. As a consequence, those theories can not
be used as starting points for an analysis of the stability
and the dynamics of laser arrays.

III. GENERAL FORMALISM FOR THE
DESCRIPTION OF VCSEL ARRAYS

A. Rate equations for the carrier densities:
injection, non-radiative recombination and diﬀusion

The carrier densities of a VCSEL array can be sepa-
rated into densities Di associated with a position in the
array and either left or right circular polarization. In a
two dimensional VCSEL array, i represents the coordi-
nates (r, c,
) for row number r, column number c and
plus for right circular polarization, minus for left circular
polarization. When no electromagnetic ﬁeld is present,
the carrier dynamics including the eﬀects of injection,
non-radiative recombination and diﬀusion are

±

Di = µi −

γiDi − Xj

Tij(Di −

Dj),

(1)

where µi is the eﬀective local injection current, γi the
local non-radiative recombination rate and Tij = Tji is
the rate of diﬀusive carrier exchange between the den-
sities Di and Dj. Note that the model assumes trans-
parency at µ = 0. When comparing the predictions of
the model with experiment, it must be taken into ac-
count that µ represents the additional injection current
after transparency has been reached. The real injection
current is µ plus a device dependent constant. The non-
radiative recombination rate and the carrier diﬀusion can
conveniently be combined into a single relaxation matrix
of the densities by deﬁning

Γij = δij (γi +

Tik)

Tij.

Equation 2 describes the diﬀusive relaxation to an
equilibrium of injection and recombination of electron-
hole pairs. This constitutes the complete carrier dynam-
ics at zero ﬁeld. Typical relaxation rates are around
1010s−

1, as was discussed in II.

B. Maxwell’s equations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld:
gain, loss and coherent propagation

±

The electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the optical cavity of
the laser array can be described by the complex ﬁeld
amplitudes of localized modes Ei of either left or right
circular polarization. Each mode is associated with one
density pool. In a two dimensional array, i represents the
same coordinates (r, c,
) given above. This is an essen-
tial feature of the split density model. The split densi-
ties correspond to a set of modes for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld which is diﬀerent from the Eigenmodes of Maxwell’s
equations. Instead, these modes are Eigenmodes of the
gain. They are the natural modes for the description of
relaxation oscillations and limit cycles as well as the sta-
bility of ﬁxed points. We will therefore chose this set
of Eigenmodes and not the supermodes to describe the
laser array. We note that we limit our theory to the fun-
damental mode of each laser in the array and disregard
possible eﬀects of spatial hole-burning within each laser.
A generalization to include higher modes is possible, but
would make it more diﬃcult to distinguish array eﬀects
from the internal dynamics of individual lasers.
The dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,

includ-
loss and coherent propagation are given by
ing gain,
Maxwell’s equations, which are linear wave equations. In
a general mode representation, they may be written as

d
dt

Ei = wiDi(1

−

iα)Ei − Xj

(κij + iωij)Ej.

(3)

The carrier density dependent gain is given by wiDi.
The rate of spontaneous emission into the laser mode wi
is typically around 106s−
1. Since most arrays will have
very similar values for the diﬀerent wi, the average and
the deviations from this average may be seperated into
wi = ¯w(1 + fi). In this context, fi is the measure of the
relative ﬂuctuation in the coupling between density pool
i and mode i.

The alpha factor α describes band structure eﬀects
which shift the gain proﬁle to higher frequencies as the
total density is increased. Typical values range from 2 to
6. Eﬀectively, this shift of the gain proﬁle introduces a
carrier density dependent index of refraction.

κij describes the losses through the mirrors. In most
cases, the coeﬃcients coupling diﬀerent modes are very
small and most of the losses are given by ¯κδij with ¯κ
around 1012s−
1. Small irregularities and birefringence in
the mirrors may cause non negligible loss guiding eﬀects
which can be represented by small corrections ¯κlij.

The matrix ωij describes the unitary coherent dynam-
ics of Maxwell’s equations based on the index of refrac-
tion of the array structure. Neighbouring modes interact
by their overlapping evanescent waves, while right and
left circular polarization modes are coupled by stress in-
duced birefringence commonly found in epitaxially grown
semiconductor heterostructures [15]. Since the magni-
tude of these eﬀects is highly dependent on device archi-

tecture, it is diﬃcult to estimate. However, their order
of magnitude should be roughly between 1010s−
1 and
1 to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the dynamics. For
1012s−
a given architecture, numerical simulations may be used
to determine the eﬀective coupling constant.

For stationary densities Di, the dynamics of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is strictly linear. It is therefore possible
to ﬁnd orthogonal Eigenmodes of the dynamics includ-
ing the cooperative eﬀects of gain guiding (wiDi), loss
guiding (κij) and index guiding (ωij). These modes are
the supermodes of the coupled mode theories. Note that
Eigenmodes of diﬀerent density distributions Di need not
be orthogonal. Since semiconductor lasers are type B
lasers, the dynamics of the Di cannot be neglected and
the modes deﬁned by stationary Di are next to useless
for the investigation of dynamical eﬀects and stability
analysis.

C. Combined dynamics of the carrier density and
the electromagnetic ﬁeld

Now, the total dynamics of carrier density and elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld can be constructed by adding only the
2wiE∗i EiDi, to the car-
term of induced emission, i.e.
rier density dynamics. The resulting equations of motion
for N split densities and N complex ﬁeld amplitudes rep-
resenting, for example, an array of N/2 VCSELs with two
polarizations each are

These two lines of equations already contain a large num-
ber of diﬀerent physical eﬀects. The localized modes in
the array are not only coupled by overlapping evanescent
waves (ωij) but also by carrier diﬀusion (Γij) and by
variations in the losses (lij ). The injection current may
be varied (µi) and the coupling of the active medium to
the laser mode may also be diﬀerent for each laser in the
array (fi).

In the following, we shall focus our attention on ar-
rays pumped homogeneously (µi = µ) and with negligible
variations in the gain and loss coeﬃcients (fi = lij = 0),
resulting in

fects of coherent coupling and non-negligible gain-loss

IV. THE TWO DENSITY MODEL

A. Formulation of the rate equations

To understand how the eﬀects of coherent ﬁeld dynam-
ics and carrier diﬀusion inﬂuence the stability of phase
locking and the transition to chaos, we will now start our
discussion with an investigation of the most simple case
of two carrier density pools and two light ﬁeld modes.
This case describes either the polarization dynamics of
a single VCSEL or an array of two edge emitting lasers.
In these contexts, the equations of the two density model
have been studied previously by Martin-Regalado (polar-
ization) [12] and by Winful and Wang (array) [4] on the
basis of numerical simulations. In the following we will
review the results of the two density model and analyti-
cally derive general properties of array and polarization
dynamics.

The equations for a symmetrical system of two carrier
densitiy pools are deﬁned by the parameters ¯w, ¯κ, Γ11,
Γ12, and ω12. It is useful to keep in mind that Γ11 is the
sum of the carrier diﬀusion rate Γ12 and the non-radiative
recombination rate γ. They read

All rates are given by positive and real values. This is
not a natural assumption for ω12, since a phase trans-
formation in one of the two modes would generally also
change the phase factor of ω12. A real and positive ω12
implies that the E1 +E2 mode has a lower frequency than
E2 mode for D1 = D2 (no gain eﬀects on the

In an array, this is a natural choice.
mode structure).
If the modes describe orthogonal polarizations, however,
the phase factor of ω12 is an important deﬁnition of the
phase relation between the modes.

B. Stability analysis

If the two subsystems were not coupled by ω12, they
could be described as two identical lasers operating at
the same injection current. Therefore, D1 = D2 and
E∗1 E1 = E∗2 E2 is stationary. The introduction of ω12

removes the arbitrary choice of phase and deﬁnes the
supermodes with E1 =
E2 or E1 = E2 as the only
possible stationary solutions for the light ﬁeld.

−

The exact stationary solutions are given by D1 = D2 =
¯κ/ ¯w and E∗1 E1 = E∗2 E2 = µ/2¯κ
γ/2 ¯w. To analyse the
stability of the two possible supermodes, small ﬂuctua-
tions around these stable values are deﬁned:

Note that in the case of polarization dynamics, s1 and

is equal to plus or minus the total intensity for the two
stationary solutions.

where ns = E∗1 E1 + E∗2 E2 is the total intensity of the
stationary solution. To obtain the stability matrix for
the symmetric supermode with E1 = E2 and s3 = +ns,
one only has to change the sign of ω12.

The stability matrix can be separated into two blocks.
One two by two block describes the relaxation oscillations
of the total intensity. The remaining three by three block
contains all the relevant information on the interaction
between the subsystems. For weak coupling, s1 and d
show relaxation oscillations damped by diﬀusion, while
s2 will be stabilized or destabilized exponentially by its
interaction with d via α.

The condition for the stability of a solution is, that the
real parts of all Eigenvectors of the matrix given above
are negative. For the symmetric supermode E1 + E2,
which is the lowest frequency mode, this condition may
be found by searching for a parameter set with one Eigen-
value equal to 0. This is done by setting the determinant
of the stability matrix to 0. The result of this analysis is

ω12 > 2¯κα

¯wns
γ + ¯wns + 2Γ12

.

Since we must assume that the diﬀusion rate Γ12 is not
much larger than the non-radiative recombination rate γ
for the split density model to be valid and since the rate
of induced emission ¯wns cannot be much larger than γ
for reasonable injection currents, this condition can only
be fulﬁlled if ω12 is as large as the loss rate ¯κ. This
would require frequency separations of THz between the
supermodes, which is unlikely if any reasonable gain, in-
dex or loss guiding exists to separate the modes. Since
such guiding eﬀects are absolutely necessary to deﬁne
the array, the low frequency solution is only stable if the
description of the device as an array of coupled lasers
breaks down. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in
a laser array guiding eﬀects reduce ω12 to values below
¯κ. Consequently only the highest frequency supermode
can be stable in a two mode array. If a diﬀerent super-
mode is stabilized, this is most likely not an array eﬀect,
but instead represents higher mode eﬀects typical of a
broad area laser device [13,14]. In the case of polariza-
tion dynamics in VCSELs, a birefringence eﬀect of THz
is unrealistically high. Experiments indicate that ω12 is
more likely to be of the same order of magnitude as γ
[15]. Therefore, the stable polarization corresponds al-
ways to the one with the highest frequency. Of course,
the stability condition for the low frequency mode can
still be fulﬁlled very close to threshold. This gives rise
to a bistability which was reported in [12]. However,
according to our estimates, this bistability should only
occur extremely close to threshhold, where noise eﬀects
dominate the laser dynamics. This bistability is therefore
not likely to be of any practical relevance.

−

The condition for stablility of the anti-symmetric su-
E2 is found by searching for parameters
permode E1
permitting the existence of purely imaginary Eigenvec-
tors. This indicates the point at which the relaxation
oscillations of s1 and d become undamped. The condi-
tion for damped relaxation oscillations is found to be

αω12 < γ + ¯wns + 2Γ12.

(10)

This condition is always fulﬁlled if the damping eﬀect
of the diﬀusion rate 2Γ12 exceeds the undamping eﬀect
of the coherent coupling αω12. Eﬀectively, a moderate
amount of diﬀusion stabilizes phase locking and prevents
the transition to limit cycles and chaos. If αω12 exceeds
γ + 2Γ12, a minimal intensity is necessary to stabilize
phase locking. Possibly, this intensity is unrealistically
high, so that injection currents far above threshold would
be necessary to stabilize the dynamics. Otherwise, a
transition from stability to a limit cycle will be observ-
able as the injection current is lowered.

C. Dynamics close to the ﬁxed point: damping and
undamping of relaxation oscillations

In order to provide a foundation for the discussion of limit
cycles and for the extrapolation of the results to larger
arrays, we will now take a closer look at the dynamics
of ﬂuctuations around the ﬁxed point. This is done by
ﬁnding the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues of the stabil-
ity matrix. Although, in principle, approximations are
not necessary to diagonalize the two by two and three by
three blocks of the stability matrix it helps the interpre-
tation of the physics if we make use of the fact that for
semiconductor lasers, the cavity loss rate ¯κ is typically
two orders of magnitude larger than the non-radiative
recombination rate γ. As a result, the ﬂuctuations of
semiconductor lasers are dominated by fast relaxation
oscillations of the frequency ν = (2¯κ ¯wns)1/2. The sta-
bility matrix can then be diagonalized by treating the
damping term γ + ¯wns + 2Γ12 and the coherent coupling
ω12 as small perturbations of the relaxation oscillations.

The solution 1/2 describes the linearized relaxation os-
cillations of the total intensity and carrier density, solu-
tion 3 describes the stabilization of anti-phase locking
and solution 4/5 describes the relaxation oscillations of
the diﬀerence in the intensities and carrier densities.

The solutions 3 and 4/5 describe the supermode stabil-
ity we are interested in. We note that an important fea-
ture of the Eigenvectors is their non-orthogonality. This
is caused by the α factor. The α factor converts density
ﬂuctuations into phase ﬂuctuations. An example to illus-
trate this eﬀect can be given by the relaxation dynamics
of a ﬂuctuation in the intensity diﬀerence s1, described
at time t = 0 by the vector (0, 0, 0, 1, 0). As shown in
Fig. 2, this intensity ﬂuctuation induces a phase ﬂuctua-
tion proportional to α as it relaxes.

The relaxation rates of the solution are inﬂuenced by
this correlation between phase ﬂuctuations and intensity
ﬂuctuations. In solution 3, the α factor converts the time
derivative of the intensity diﬀerence, d/dt s1 = ω12s2, into
a time derivative of the phase, λ3s2 = α d/dt s1, causing
stability or instability, depending on the mode. In solu-
tion 4/5, the time derivative of the phase is likewise con-
verted into a time derivative of the intensity diﬀerence,
increasing or decreasing stability. If the phase diﬀerence
is stabilized, the relaxation oscillations are destabilized
and vice versa. Mathematically, this is necessary because
the sum of all Eigenvalues λi must be equal to the trace
of the stability matrix.

Since the α factor increases frequency with increasing
carrier densities, the equations show that only the super-
mode with highest frequency is stabilized in the presence
of relaxation oscillations. However, the stability analysis
has shown that strong coupling may destabilize this so-
lution as well. In the Eigenvalues of solution 4/5, this is
expressed by the negative contribution of αω12.

To understand the undamping eﬀect given by αω12, let
us recall that s1 and s2 oscillate in phase, with s2 = αs1.
Consequently, the matrix element ω12 causes an undamp-
ing of this oscillation by adding a term equivalent to
+αω12s1 to the time derivative of s1. Eﬀectively, we
thus encounter the surprising property that the coher-
ent dynamics of the light ﬁeld pumps intensity from the
mode at low intensity to the mode at high intensity. This
destabilizing eﬀect is countered by the carrier density re-
laxation eﬀects when the carrier density diﬀerence d is
maximal and the light ﬁeld intensity diﬀerence s1 is zero.
In this way, non-radiative (γ) and radiative ( ¯wns) carrier
recombination and diﬀusion (2Γ12) stabilize the relax-
ation oscillations by damping d, while coherent coupling
(αω12) destabilize them by undamping s1.

D. Low amplitude limit cycle

If the relaxation oscillations are undamped, the result
is a low amplitude limit cycle. For small amplitudes, this
limit cycle still resembles relaxation oscillations with

The damping term is still linear, since the diﬀusion and
the carrier recombination terms are linear over a wide
range of carrier densities. The undamping term is more
complicated. It results from the phase dynamics

For small s1/ns, the term of 3rd order in s1 reduces
and ﬂattens the maxima of s2. To determine the time
averaged eﬀect on the amplitude A0, the contributions
to the time derivative of s1 in phase with the oscillations
must be found. This is the Fourier component of sin(νt).
Since the Fourier component of sin(νt) in sin3(νt) is 3/4,
the total time averaged damping is

This equation describes the transition from stability to

sion. The intensity dependent contribution to the stabil-
ity is the rate of induced emission, ¯wns.

The amplitude of the limit cycle which has been calcu-
lated numerically in the paper on laser arrays by Winful
and Wang [4] can now be determined analytically using
this formula. That limit cycle was calculated at an in-
jection current of 1.1 times threshold, while stability is
reached at 2 times threshold for the parameters used.

V. GENERALIZATION OF THE TWO DENSITY
MODEL RESULTS TO LARGER ARRAYS

B. Stability of the anti-phase locked supermode

A. Eﬀective next neighbour interaction

Our analysis shows that in the case of stability, two
interacting lasers will emit light 180 degree out of phase.
This result can also be applied to larger arrays. Usually,
the coupling constants ωij only couple next neighbours.
If all ωij are real and positive, the stable mode will be the
one in which next neighbours emit light 180 degree out
of phase. Note that in the case of a VCSEL array, the
two circular polarizations must be considered as separate
members of the array, coupled by birefringence. In this
sense, VCSEL polarization adds a third dimension to the
otherwise two dimensional array.

In most conventional geometries, it is very easy to ﬁnd
a single stable supermode in which all next neighbours
emit exactly out of phase. For example, a square array
of VCSELs will emit light of a single linear polarization
in the highest frequency supermode. In the far ﬁeld, this
corresponds to four intensity maxima emitted into direc-
tions tilted towards the corners of the array. This result
has been observed experimentally [1], providing evidence
that the split density model is a valid description for re-
alistic devices.

In unconventional geometries such as triangular arrays
or spatially varying birefringence, there may be more
than one stable supermode. The stationary solutions
may be obtained by letting the ﬁeld amplitudes Ei be
equal to +E0 or
E0. Among these modes, promising
candidates for stability are always the arrangements with
the highest possible number of phase changes between
next neighbours.

−

Once the stable modes have been identiﬁed using the
rule that next neighbours try to achieve anti-phase lock-
ing, the stability of this mode with regard to phase ﬂuc-
tuations and relaxation oscillations may be investigated.
Since we can assume that the fastest time scale is that
of the relaxation oscillations, the two eﬀects may be sep-
arated. The justiﬁcation for this separation is the same
as the one underlying the stability analysis of IV: The
Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues of the stability matrix may
be determined by treating ωij and the eﬀects of damping
and diﬀusion as small perturbations of the fast relaxation
oscillations. The 3N dimensional system of equations for
the carrier densities and the real and imaginary parts of
the ﬁelds of N lasers can then be separated into a system
with 2N dimensions describing relaxation oscillations and
one of N dimensions describing phase coupling.

In the following, we limit the coupling terms to next
neighbour interactions, allowing a complete stability
analysis of large symmetric laser arrays.

First, we will investigate the N dimensional stability
matrix which describes the phase coupling of the ar-

This result may be generalized to larger arrays by using

ics of phase ﬂuctuations is then given by

(20)

This equation describes the linear relaxation of phase
ﬂuctuations in an array of arbitrary size and geometry.
The stability matrix is deﬁned by the αωij . Note, that
the relaxation has the properties of a diﬀusion such as
the one described by Tij for the carrier densities as in-
troduced in III. This indicates that local phase changes
diﬀuse to the neighbouring systems until the whole array
is again phase locked. For an array with lattice constant
a0, the phase diﬀusion constant is approximately given by
a2
0αωij. Thus, for micrometer scale arrays, typical phase
diﬀusion constants are probably around 1µm2/ns. This
is the same order of magnitude as the carrier diﬀusion
constant, even though the physical properties deﬁning
each are quite independent of each other.

C. Anti-diﬀusion and the route to chaos

The remaining 2N variables of the stability matrix de-
scribe relaxation oscillations of the carrier densities and
the light ﬁeld intensities of the array.

In the two density model, the relaxation oscillation am-
plitude of both the total intensity and the intensity diﬀer-
ence are damped by the non-radiative and the radiative
recombination of carriers, i.e. γ + ¯wns. In addition, the
oscillations of the intensity diﬀerence are damped by dif-
fusion, 2Γ12 and undamped by the coherent interaction
between the two systems, αω12. Again the coherent in-
teraction acts as a diﬀusion process. However, this time
the diﬀusion constant is negative: the coherent coupling
gives rise to anti-diﬀusion, increasing the intensity diﬀer-
ence between next neighbours.

If we denote the local amplitude of the relaxation os-
cillations in the subsystem i by the complex value Ai, the
two density result may be generalized to arbitrary arrays

ous subsection to the phase ﬂuctuations. The dynamics

(21)

Note, that Γij has been decomposed into the contribu-
tions from non-radiative carrier recombination γi and
from diﬀusion Tij, because they contribute to diﬀerent
types of eﬀects. γi + ¯wns causes an overall relaxation
of the oscillations, while the diﬀusion and anti-diﬀusion
αωij /2 are sensitive only to amplitude dif-
terms Tij −
ferences between nearest neighbours. For γi = γ0 =
constant, the relaxation eﬀect stabilizes all forms of re-
laxation oscillations equally well. The diﬀusion stabi-
lizes especially the relaxation oscillations with an am-
plitude which varies strongly between neighbouring sys-
tems. Consequently, these relaxation oscillations are also
undamped most eﬀectively when Tij < αωij /2.
In a
regular lattice, the least stable relaxation oscillation in
the presence of such anti-diﬀusion is the one in which
Ai =
Aj for next neighbours. In a square lattice with
constant coherent interaction ωnn and constant diﬀusion
Tnn between next neighbours, the stability condition for
this oscillation is

−

αωij < 2Tij +

(γiAi + ¯wns)

(22)

When αωij exceeds this limit, the relaxation oscilla-
tions become undamped and the near ﬁeld intensity os-
cillates in a chessboard pattern. Since this implies that
the intensities of all VCSELs emitting in the same phase
oscillate in parallel, this oscillation should show up as a
small intensity peak in the otherwise dark center of the
far ﬁeld pattern.

For stronger anti-diﬀusion, more and more relaxation
oscillations become undamped and the amplitude of the
oscillations increases. The chessboard pattern of the os-
cillations will then be washed out and non-linear eﬀects
shift the frequencies and add higher harmonics. For very
strong coupling, the neighbouring VCSELs will switch on
and oﬀ in an unpredictable chaotic fashion.

VI. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND OPEN
QUESTIONS

The split density model is the most simple way of de-
scribing the array and polarization dynamics of VCSELs.
It is also applicable to the array dynamics of conventional
edge emitting arrays.

For the most interesting case of large symmetric ar-
rays, the results of the split density model are strikingly
simple and clear: if the separation between the lasers in

the array does not break down because of rapid diﬀu-
sion, next neighbours lock into anti-phase laser emission.
Consequently, only the highest frequency supermode is
stabilized.

For VCSEL arrays, this behavior has indeed been ob-
served experimentally in [1–3]. In [1], this eﬀect is ex-
plained as the result of higher losses between the VCSELs
in the array. In the split density model, this corresponds
to a coupling via the lij terms introduced in III. Such
terms do indeed stabilize the highest order supermode to
a certain degree. However, since the lij are proportional
to the weak intensities, while the ωij terms are propor-
tional to the ﬁelds between the VCSELs , this eﬀect is
likely to be much smaller than the coherent interaction.
We therefore conclude that the explanation given in [1]
for the experimentally observed anti-phase locking may
be a misinterpretation caused by the neglect of carrier
dynamics in many coupled mode theories [8–10]. Those
theories certainly ignore the stabilizing eﬀects of carrier
dynamics and coherent interaction, which cannot be ne-
glected in type B lasers.

Another aspect of the split density model, pioneered
in the numerical work by Winful and Wang [4], is the ex-
istence of limit cycles and chaos in semiconductor laser
arrays. We have calculated the stability limit includ-
ing carrier diﬀusion eﬀects and have shown that stability
is not as unlikely as predicted in the original paper by
Winful and Wang. Indeed, carrier diﬀusion may stabi-
lize phase locking.

A careful analysis of the ﬂuctuations in the center of
a far ﬁeld pattern such as the one observed in [1] could
reveal whether the array is well stabilized by diﬀusion
(weak ﬂuctuations in the center), shows anti-diﬀusion
(ﬂuctuations have a maximum in the center) or is al-
ready oscillating in a weak limit cycle (coherent light is
emitted into the center of the far ﬁeld). Possibly, the
correct range of parameters necessary for limit cycles and
weak chaos could be realized experimentally by varying
the distance between the VCSELs to change diﬀusion ef-
fects and by using diﬀerent types of optical guiding. For
larger separations, pure gain guiding may be suﬃcient,
while loss guiding is better for very small arrays.

In the same spirit, VCSEL polarization may be investi-
gated, using the quantum well width to change scattering
rates and stress to induce birefringence. Here, too, the
frequency spectrum of the polarization orthogonal to the
laser mode reveals a lot about the mechanism of stabi-
lization in the VCSEL and may actually include coherent
emissions from a limit cycle. Possibly, some of the VC-
SELs classiﬁed as having only poor polarization stability
in reality show a well stabilized high frequency limit cy-
cle and it is the time average of this limit cycle which is
observed in polarization measurements.

Of course, when interpreting experimental results, the
underlying assumptions made in the split density model
must be kept in mind.
If the diﬀusion or the spin ﬂip
scattering is too strong, the split densities must again be
considered as a single carrier density and the supermodes

(γ + ¯wns + 2Γ12 − αω12)/2 = ν/5. This example illustrates
clearly, that ﬂuctuations in the intensity diﬀerence s1 induce
strong ﬂuctuations in the phase diﬀerence described by s2.

the experimentally accessible range of injection current and

become higher modes of a single laser with many modes.
Consequently, the split density model can be used to de-
scribe the transition from split to uniﬁed density. This
has been attempted for polarization dynamics in quan-
tum well VCSELs by Martin-Regalado in [12]. However,
that approach is only valid for a narrow range of parame-
ters and it may be debatable if the limitation to the low-
est quantum well bands implied in [5,12] is still justiﬁed
in quantum wells with such a strong spin ﬂip scattering.
If the injection current is increased, higher order modes
of the individual lasers in the array may also participate
in the dynamics. However, to simplify the presentation
we have disregarded multi-transverse modes of an indi-
vidual laser. When considering that case, one has to
assume that the dynamics is not governed by array ef-
fects, but instead by phenomena typical of broad area
laser dynamics. The transition between the two regimes
can be seen in numerical simulations of gain guided edge
emitting arrays [13,14]. In order to simulate the eﬀect in
the framework of the split density model, higher modes
must be assigned to each density. However, this rapidly
reduces the simplicity which makes the model so attrac-
tive.

In conclusion, we have shown that the split density
model provides a simple description of semiconductor
laser arrays and is equally useful for the description of
VCSEL polarization. The results clearly show that the
mode with the highest frequency is stabilized. This is in
agreement with the experimental results reported in [1–3]
and indicates that the handwaving explanation of the
anti-phase locking given in [1] may indeed be wrong. We
have seen that strong coupling may undamp the relax-
ation oscillations, leading through limit cycles to chaos.
However, carrier difusion and both radiative and non-
radiative carrier recombinations stabilize the anti-phase
locked mode, which makes the stable operation of a VC-
SEL array more likely than the chaotic case.

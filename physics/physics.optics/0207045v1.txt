We demonstrate the combination of a hemispherical solid immersion lens with a micro–
photoluminescence set–up. Two advantages introduced by the SIL, an improved resolution of 0.4
times the wavelength in vacuum and a 5 times enhancement of the collection eﬃciency, make it an
ideal system for spatially resolved spectroscopy applications. The inﬂuence of the air gap between
the SIL and the sample surface is investigated in detail. We conﬁrm the tolerance of the set–up
to an air gap of several micrometers. Such a system is proven to be ideal system in the studies of
exciton transport and polarization dependent single quantum dot spectroscopy.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Photoluminescence (PL) is one of the most important
methods to investigate electronic states in semiconduc-
tors. Since semiconductor nanostructure becomes in-
creasingly important in optoelectronic applications, the
PL has been developed to local spectroscopy. To re-
alize spatial resolution, one needs local excitation or

lution is limited by diﬀraction.
In a common micro-
photoluminescence (µ-PL) system, the achieved resolu-
tion is about 1 µm. This limitation of the resolution can
be overcome by working in the near–ﬁeld regime, where
the diﬀraction limit is not yet established. Scanning near-
ﬁeld optical microscopy (SNOM), designed according to
this idea, realized a resolution of ∼ 100 nm. Despite of
this high resolution, several inherent as well as technical
problems[1] limit the performance of SNOM.

Another way to deal with the diﬀraction limitation is
to increase the refractive index of the media around the
sample, i.e., to increase the eﬀective numerical aperture
(NAef f ) of the optical system. This can be realized by
immersing the sample into oil or put a tiny lens, named
solid immersion lens (SIL), on the surface of the sample.
In the case of semiconductor spectroscopy, the latter is
more suitable since SIL is easily to be dealt with and
there is no risk to contaminate the sample.

During the last decade, SIL has been used in solid
immersion microscope[2] and (magneto–)optical data
storage[3] for high spatial resolution or high storage den-
sity, respectively. Recently, SIL has also been intro-
duced in spatially resolved pump–probe experiments.[1,
4]. By including a superspherical SIL[5](s–SIL) in a
µ–PL system, an improved spatial resolution at room
temperature[6] as well as low temperatures[7] has been
demonstrated by PL imaging measurements of GaAs
quantum well (QW). The high spatial resolution has
allowed to study carrier migration under global[7] or
local[8] excitation conditions. Besides, s–SIL has also
been used in a scanning µ–PL setup to investigate exci-
ton localization in GaAs QW [9, 10].

Up to now, only s–SIL has been applied in µ–PL sys-
tem. But, the thickness of an s–SIL is designed for one
particular wavelength since the incident parallel beam is
focused at the distance r(1 + 1/nSIL) away from the top

of the s–SIL, where r is the radius of the SIL and nSIL is
the refractive index of the SIL material. Consequently,
the focus of an s–SIL is wavelength-dependent since nSIL
depends on the wavelength of light, λ. On the contrast,
a hemispherical SIL (h–SIL) is universal for any wave-
length.
In a PL experiment, one typically deals with
diﬀerent wavelengths for excitation and detection. Thus,
although an s-SIL can improve the resolution n2
SIL times
while an h-SIL can only improve it nSIL times, the latter
is more appropriate for PL studies.

In this paper, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the
combination of an h-SIL with a confocal µ-PL system.
We conﬁrm the realized spatial resolution of 0.4λ by in-
troducing the h-SIL. We also ﬁnd an enhancement of
collection eﬃciency of about 5 times, which is consis-
tence with a theoretical estimation. We discuss in de-
tail the inﬂuences of an air gap between the SIL and the
sample surface on the resolution and collection eﬃciency.
We demonstrate that an air gap of several micrometers
can be tolerated in a system with NAef f < 1. Finally,
some applications of this system to semiconductor spec-
troscopy are discussed, with an emphasis on its advan-
tages over a SNOM system.

II. SOLID IMMERSION LENS–ENHANCED
MICRO–PHOTOLUMINE-SCENCE

A. Experimental Setup

Figure 1 shows schematically the SIL–enhanced µ–PL
system. The excitation source can be a continuous wave
(cw) or pulse laser. The laser beam is expanded to ﬁt the
diameter of objective, then reﬂected by a beam–splitter
and focused on the sample surface through a microscope
objective (20 ×, numerical aperture NAObj = 0.4). The
same objective is used for collecting the PL from the
sample. The signal passes the beam-splitter and a tube
lens and is then focused to the image plane of the micro-
scope. A set of pinholes, with diﬀerent sizes, is installed
in the image plane to select the detection area. By scan-
ning the pinhole in the image plane, one can detect lumi-
nescence from diﬀerent positions on the sample surface.
For cw measurements, the PL is recorded by a double-
grating monochromator and a cooled CCD camera, with

a spectral resolution of 30 µeV. For time–resolved mea-
surements, a streak camera with temporal resolution of
2 ps is used in combination with a CCD camera with
photon counting.

The h–SIL, made of ZrO2 with nSIL = 2.16 at λ =
600 nm, is adhesively ﬁxed to the sample surface. The
sample with the SIL is vertically mounted in a helium–
ﬂow cryostat. The SIL can be used in the temperature
range of 6∼300 K for an unlimited number of cooling
cycles. The diameter of the SIL is chosen to be 1 mm,
which is large enough for giving an enough working area
for spectroscopy and being handled without any special
equipment, and still small enough to be sticked on the
sample adhesively even in vertical conﬁguration.

B. Spatial Resolution

In a far–ﬁeld optical system, the spatial resolution is
limited by diﬀraction of the light. For a plane wave inci-
dent light, the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of
the Airy pattern is given by

HWHM =

0.26λ
nNAobj

.

(1)

Here, n represents the refraction index of the media
around the sample. Without SIL, n ≈ 1 (air) and with
the h–SIL we have n = nSIL = 2.16. Thus, by introduc-
ing the h–SIL, we can improve the resolution by more
than 2 times.
In order to conﬁrm the achieved resolu-
tion, we install the SIL onto an arbitrary ﬂat sample and
focus the incident laser beam of a He–Ne laser on the
sample surface (i)underneath and (ii)outside the SIL, re-
spectively. We measure two–dimensional intensity maps
of the laser spots in both case, as shown in Fig. 2(a) with
the same color encoding. The length–scale collaboration
in these maps is obtained by imaging an optical grating
with known parameters. The spatial intensity proﬁles in
Fig. 2(b) are obtained by taking a line–scan across the
laser spots. As expected, the proﬁle with SIL (i) is about
2 times narrower than that obtained without SIL (ii). In
(i) the realized spatial resolution (HWHM of the laser

spot) is 0.4λ (corresponding to 260 nm for the He–Ne
laser (633 nm)) in contrast to 0.8λ for (ii). We note that
the achieved values of HWHM in both cases are larger

than that calculated from Eq. 1. This is consistent with
theoretical calculation[11], and can be attributed to the
Guassian proﬁle, rather than plane wave, of the laser
beam[12] used in the experiment and the high NA[11] of
the system.

In a confocal µ-PL system, the resolution can be fur-
ther improved by introducing a pinhole with a suitable
size to the image plane of the microscope.[12] In the fol-
lowings, we present a quantitative analysis of this further
improvement. The illumination function of the laser ex-
citation can be described by a Guassian function,

iill(q) = exp(−2

).

Here, q is the coordinate in the focal plane, i.e., sample
surface, and wlaser is the spot radius at 1/e2. The de-
tection function idet can also be described by Guassian
function, but with a diﬀerent radius wlumi since generally
the wavelength of the luminescence is diﬀerent from that
of the excitation laser in a PL experiment. The trans-
mission function of the pinhole is

with q0 the radius of the pinhole image. Thus, the detec-

FIG. 3: Calculated HWHM of the confocal acceptance func-

tal full line represents the HWHM obtained with an inﬁnite
large pinhole. In the calculation, the excitation and detection
wavelengths are 476.5 nm and 529 nm, respectively, which are
consistent with the experimental conditions.

The confocal acceptance function (CAF) is then given by

pconf(q) = iill(q) · c(q).

(5)

Based on the above analysis, we calculate the pconf of
our SIL–enhanced µ–PL system. Figure 3 shows the cal-
culated HWHM of the CAF, which deﬁnes the confocal
resolution, as function of the pinhole size. The horizontal
line represents the resolution obtained without pinhole.
We ﬁnd that a pinhole of 60 µm has no eﬀect on the res-
olution, but decreasing the pinhole size from that value
the resolution is enhanced. Below 10 µm, the enhance-
ment is saturated while further decrease the pinhole size.

In order to conﬁrm that the enhancement of resolu-
tion by the SIL and pinhole can be achieved in a real-
istic PL measurement, we measure the spectra from a
ZnCdSe/ZnSe quantum dot sample with diﬀerent SIL–
pinhole conﬁgurations. In this sample, a ZnCdSe layer
with a thickness of 2.9 monolayers is embedded between
two ZnSe barriers, including Cd–rich quantum dots with
an average size of about 10 nm. The spectrally sharp
lines in the spectrum correspond to excitonic transitions
in individual dots. The variations in size, shape and com-
position of these dots lead to a wide spectral distribu-
tion of the lines. Hence, in a macroscopic PL spectrum
(not shown here), one observes a broad smooth emis-
sion band due to the large number of contributing dots.
When decreasing the detection area, hence the number
of the dots, individual sharp lines can be resolved on top
of the unresolved smooth background. The resolved part

becomes more and more pronounced with decreasing de-
tection area. Eventually, once the detection area is small
enough, the unresolved background will disappear. Such
a kind of sample, with suitable dot density, can be used to
prove qualitatively the enhancement of spatial resolution
by introducing the SIL.

Figure 4 shows four spectra detected at a sample tem-
perature of 6 K with diﬀerent SIL–pinhole conﬁgurations,
i.e., without SIL and pinhole (A), with SIL but without
pinhole (B), with SIL and a 20 µm diameter pinhole (C),
with SIL and a 10 µm diameter pinhole, respectively. The
sample is excited by the 476.5 nm line of an Ar–ion laser.
All spectra are composed of a resolved and an unresolved
part, but the resolved sharp lines in the spectrum is more
pronounced as we go from (A) to (D). We ﬁt the back-
ground by a Gaussian function in order to separate the
resolved and the unresolved part. The choice of a Gaus-
sian is legitimate because of the inhomogeneous distribu-
tion of a large number of quantum dots contributing to
the spectra. For each spectrum, we calculate the ratio,
R, of the spectrally integrated intensities of the resolved
part to the unresolved smooth background. Such a ratio
increases with enhancing the resolution of the system, as
we discussed above. From Fig. 4 we obtain an increase of
R by 30 % by introducing the SIL (compare 0.109 of A to
0.143 of B). By introducing a 20 µm pinhole, R is further
increased by 20 % (0.171 of C). In case D, a 10 µm pin-
hole is used instead of the 20 µm one. But we don’t ﬁnd
a further increase of R (0.170 of D). This is consistent
with our analysis discussed above. As shown in Fig. 3,
the enhancement of the resolution introduced by chang-
ing a 20 µm pinhole to a 10 µm one (vertical dots) is
much smaller than that from non–pinhole to 20 µm pin-
hole (vertical full line). In practice, the signal level drops
seriously as decreasing the pinhole size from 20 µm, and
the alignment becomes more diﬃcult. Thus, a pinhole
size of 20 µm is the optimal choice in our system.

C. Collection Eﬃciency

In a PL experiment, only a part of luminescence from
the sample can be collected due to the reﬂection losses
and the ﬁnite size of the optics. The collection eﬃciency
of a spectroscopy system is of crucial importance, es-
pecially in the cases of low excitation conditions or low
signal level. Since it is operated in the far ﬁeld, the col-
lection eﬃciency of a µ–PL system is much higher than
that of typical near–ﬁeld systems. By introducing a SIL
into a µ–PL system, the collection eﬃciency can be fur-
ther improved. By comparing the luminescence inten-

4

of the angle of incidence and the polarization of the ray.
This angle dependency is weak in the range of angles
given by the microscope objective. Thus, for average, we
calculate for each polarization the transmission of a ray
with an angle to the optical axes of θ/2. Furthermore,
the transmissions of s and p polarizations are averaged
to get the total transmission. Considering the reﬂection
losses of both the laser and the luminescence, we get an
enhancement factor kT = 1.2.

sities measured with SIL and without SIL, we ﬁnd the
enhancement of collection eﬃciency of our system by the
SIL is about 5 times, depending mainly on the cleaning
process of both the sample and the SIL.

Here, we present a quantitative analysis on the en-
hancement of the collection eﬃciency introduced by us-
ing the SIL. Since the nSIL is smaller than the refraction
index of the sample, nsamp, the SIL has the property to
reduce the reﬂection losses, i.e., enhance the transmission
of both the luminescence and the laser. The enhancement
of the collection eﬃciency by this factor, kT, can be cal-
culated by using Fresnel formula. Figure 5(a) shows the
conﬁgurations for our calculation of the kT by comparing
the transmissions when the SIL is used (i) or not (ii). In
case (i), since the light enters perpendicularly on the top
of the SIL, the transmission coeﬃcient of the intensity is
given by 4nSIL/(1 + nSIL)2 for all rays. However, when
entering the sample, the transmission coeﬃcient depends

FIG. 5: Schematic drawing of the SIL-sample conﬁgura-
tion. The enhancement of collection eﬃciency is explained
by higher transmission (a) and larger collection angle in the
sample (b).

Beside this transmission enhancement, the SIL can en-
large the collection angle of the µ–PL system, as shown
in Fig. 5(b). The solid angle outside of the sample is
independent of whether the SIL is used (i) or not (ii)
and is directly given by NAobj. However, the solid angle
inside the sample increases when the SIL is introduced.
This is due to the smaller refraction of the light at the
sample surface since the material on top of the sample
having now a refractive index higher than that of air. As
a result, a point source emitting light in all directions
as shown in Fig. 5(b) experiences a larger solid angle in
which the emitted photons can be collected by the ob-
jective. A ray emitted outside of this angle will miss the
objective and not contribute to the signal, even if its an-
gle to the optical axis is smaller than the critical angle
of total internal reﬂection.
In the approximation that
the photons are emitted homogeneously in all directions,
the enhancement of collection eﬃciency due to the larger
PL collection angle, kΩ, is given by the ratio of the solid
angles Ωi with SIL to Ωii without SIL:

In our set–up, we have kT = 1.2, kΩ = 4.8 so ktotal =

imental results.

III.

INFLUENCE OF AIR GAP

In the analyses of the previous section, we assume that
the SIL is ideally attached on the sample surface. In a
realistic experiment, there exists an air gap between the
ﬂat surface of the SIL and the sample surface due to the
ﬂuctuations of both surfaces as well as due to particles
between them. In this section, we discuss the inﬂuence of
such an air gap on the resolution and collection eﬃciency
of the SIL–enhanced µ–PL system.

As discussed above, the NAef f , of a SIL–enhanced
µ–PL system is determined by the NAobj and nSIL,
i.e., NAobj · nSIL for h–SIL and NAobj · n2
SIL for s–SIL.
The inﬂuence of the air gap on the resolution depends
strongly on whether NAef f > 1 or not. In a system with
NAef f > 1, near–ﬁeld coupling is required. Theoretical
analysis shew that even an air gap with a thickness of
one ﬁfth of the wavelength can deteriorate the resolu-
tion seriously.[13] In contrast, a system with NAef f < 1
is still in far–ﬁeld regime, and it has been shown theo-
retically that an air gap of several micrometers doesn’t
inﬂuence the resolution.[14].
In our set–up, we have
NAef f = 0.87 < 1 thus far–ﬁeld coupling. To check
the inﬂuence of air gap on the resolution of our system,
we load the SIL on the sample with and without clean-
ing procedure, respectively. In the latter case, an air gap
of several micrometers is anticipated (we will prove this
fact later). We focus the laser beam on the sample sur-
face, and in both cases we get the same size of the laser
spots. We even load the SIL on the surface of an op-
tical grating without any special treatment and obtain
the same resolution. Thus we conﬁrm that in a system
with NAef f < 1, an air gap of several micrometers has
no inﬂuence on the resolution.

Generally, an air gap introduces additional reﬂection
losses between the sample and the SIL, thus reduces
the collection eﬃciency.
In a near–ﬁeld system with
NAef f > 1, the collection eﬃciency can be deteriorated
seriously by an air gap of several hundreds nanometers,
i.e., comparable to the light wavelength.[14] In contrast,
a system with NAef f < 1 is anticipated to be more ro-
bust due to the far–ﬁeld feature. In order to investigate
the tolerance of our system to the air gap, we load the
SIL on a ZnCdSe/ZnSe quantum dot sample without any
cleaning procedure. By comparing the spectra measured
beneath or outside the SIL at a sample temperature of
6 K, we ﬁnd an enhancement of collection eﬃciency by a
factor of 2.

FIG. 6: Schematic drawing of the SIL-sample conﬁguration
with an air gap.

The explain the observed enhancement, we calculate
the collection eﬃciency of the system with an air gap.
Figure 6 shows the conﬁguration of the SIL, air gap and
the sample. As measuring the spectrum, we focus on the
sample surface. The path of the ray is shown as the solid
line in Fig. 6. We can also ﬁnd the focus of the ﬂat sur-
face of the SIL, as shown as the dots. Since the images
of both surfaces are clearly observable, the distance be-
tween these two foci, d, can be measured accurately. In
this experiment, we have d=40 µm. By some simple ge-
ometrical considerations, we deduce the thickness of the
air gap to be 5 µm from the measured d. Based on Fig. 6,
we calculate the collection eﬃciency of this conﬁguration
by the method discussed in the previous section. We
obtain kT = 0.55, kΩ = 4.27 so ktotal = 2.36. The cal-
culation is well consistent with the experiment. We note
that the deterioration of enhancement from 5.76 to 2.36
by the 5 µm air gap originates mainly from the increasing
of the reﬂection losses (kT drops from 1.2 to 0.55). The
enhancement due to the enlarged collection angle, kΩ, is
not sensitive to the presence of the air gap.

Thus, we prove the tolerance of the SIL–enhanced µ–
PL system to an air gap of several micrometers. This
feature is quite diﬀerence from a near–ﬁeld system with
NAef f > 1. In a typical measurement, there exists an air
gap of about 1 µ thick between the SIL and the sample
surface after a regular cleaning procedure. The enhance-
ment factor of collection eﬃciency is about 5 in our ex-
periments, as mentioned above. In principle, by increas-
ing the NAobj or nSIL, or using a s–SIL, one can further
improve the resolution of a SIL–enhanced µ–PL system.
But, if the NAef f is increased beyond 1, the near–ﬁeld
regime is reached, and the tolerance to the air gap drops
seriously.
In this sense, our choice of NA = 0.864 is
a good compromise between the enhancement of spatial
resolution and collection eﬃciency as well as the feasibil-
ity in practical operations. Further, it is worth noting
that such a system can be used even for samples with
rough surfaces with ﬂuctuations of several micrometers.

IV. APPLICATIONS

Generally, the SIL–enhance µ–PL system described
above can be applied to any semiconductor spectroscopy
experiments whenever the spatial resolution is needed
and the sample has a relative ﬂat surface. In some cases,
this system is even more suitable than any other spa-
tially resolved methods. We present in the following two
kinds of applications where the SIL–enhanced µ–PL sys-
tem shows its unique advantages.

A. Exciton Transport in Quantum Wells

The exciton in-plane transport process is an important
part of exciton dynamics in QWs. Due to the continues
miniaturization of electronic and optical devices thus the
increasing importance of nanostructures, the transport
has to be understood on a length scale comparable to
the light wavelength. The resolution of a conventional
µ–PL system, about 1 µm, is not enough for this kind
of studies.
In SNOM, one can achieve a resolution of
∼ 100 nm by using the coated tip. But the collection
eﬃciency is very poor. By using a uncoated tip, the col-
lection eﬃciency can be improved, but simultaneously
the resolution drops.[15] Furthermore, a SNOM exper-
iment has another disadvantage for transport measure-
ment: one cannot detect spatially resolved spectra from
positions outside the excitation spot. Thus, one can only
study the transport process indirectly.

In contrast, the SIL–enhanced µ–PL can be used to
investigate the transport behavior in a rather direct way
with sub-µm resolution. By scanning the pinhole in the
image plane of the objective, one can detect lumines-
cence from positions which are diﬀerent from the position
where the sample is locally excited. This enables one to
get the spatial proﬁle of the luminescence intensity, thus
the spatial distributions of the carrier density. The ﬁeld
of view of the SIL[14] (35 µm in our setup) is far be-
yond the typical transport length of carriers. In Fig. 7,
we show an example of the spatial proﬁles of the lumi-
nescence intensity measured for a ZnSe/ZnSSe multiple
quantum well at 6 K. The excitation laser used for this
measurement is a tunable cw Ti:Sapphire laser pumped
by an Ar–ion laser and frequency–doubled using a BBO
crystal. Comparing with the proﬁle of the laser excita-
tion spot, measured in the same pinhole–scanning, the
spatial distribution of the luminescence is signiﬁcantly
wider due to exciton in-plane transport. The improved
resolution enables us to access the hot exciton transport
regime.[16]

This kind of direct transport measurement can also be
performed with time resolution by using a short pulse
Ti:Sapphire laser and a synchroscan streak camera and
CCD with photon counting. In this conﬁguration, one
can detect the time evolution of the spatial proﬁle of lu-
minescence, as shown in Fig. 8(b) for a ZnSe/ZnMgSSe
multiple QW. The combination of the 200 nm spatial

bottom to top) 43, 64, 100, 180, 260, 340 and 420 ps.

resolution with the 2 ps temporal resolution enables one
to investigate more details of the exciton transport. We
note that for the time-resolved measurements, the high
collection eﬃciency introduced by the SIL is particularly
crucial, not only because of the signal losses at the pin-
hole but also because signal intensity spread due to the
time resolution.

FIG. 9: SIL–enhance µ–PL spectrum of a GaAs/AlAs su-
perlattices measured at a sample temperature of 6 K. The
excitation source is a He–Ne laser, at an excitation intensity
of 0.5 W/cm2. Isolated sharp lines from quantum dots formed
by interface ﬂuctuations are well resolved.

B. Single Quantum Dot Spectroscopy

Investigation on properties of individual quantum dot
requires single dot spectroscopy. This can be achieved
by small dot density (e.g. by nano–aperture or mesa) or
high spatial resolution (e.g. SNOM). In SIL–enhanced
µ–PL, single dot spectroscopy can also be achieved for
samples with low quantum dot density.
In such a sys-
tem, the choice of dots is more ﬂexible. Since there is no
patterning required, it is a non–destructive method.

The high spatial and spectral resolutions of the SIL–
enhance µ–PL system enable us to detect isolated narrow
lines from single quantum dot undisturbed by the lumi-
nescence from other dots. Figure 9 shows a spectrum of a
GaAs/AlAs superlattices. In this kind of samples, quan-
tum dots are formed due to the interface ﬂuctuations.[17].
A He–Ne laser is used for excitation, with an excitation
density of 0.5 W/cm2. By using the SIL and the 20 µm
pinhole,
isolated sharp lines from individual quantum
dots are well resolved.

Furthermore, we conﬁrm that the polarization infor-
mation of the luminescence, which is of crucial impor-
tance e.g. in the investigations of spin dynamics, is pre-
served in this set–up. In Fig. 10 we show the spectra of a
single quantum dot in a quantum well of 6.5 monolayers
ZnCdTe embedded in ZnTe barriers. The sample is ex-
cited with the 488 nm line from the cw Ar–ion laser. To
determine the polarization of luminescence, a linear po-
larizer is placed in the detection path. The spectra show
a doublet structure composed of two lines which are lin-

early polarized along two orthogonal directions. Such line
doublets are ascribed to ﬁne–structure splitting of exci-
tons in asymmetric quantum dots.[18] Our measurement
demonstrates that SIL can be applied to µ-PL when the
polarization of the light is of interest. It is typically very
diﬃcult to extract the polarization from other spatially
resolved techniques like near-ﬁeld spectroscopy.[19]

V. SUMMARY

We demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the combination of a
h–SIL with a µ–PL set–up. Two advantages introduced
by the SIL, an improved resolution of 0.4λ and a 5 times
enhancement of the collection eﬃciency, make it an ideal
system for spatially resolved spectroscopy applications.
We analyze the improvement of the resolution by using
the pinhole, and ﬁnd the optimal pinhole size. The in-
ﬂuence of the air gap between the SIL and the sample
surface is investigated in detail. We conﬁrm the toler-
ance of the set–up to an air gap of several micrometers.
Such a system is proven to be ideal system in the studies
of exciton transport and polarization dependent single
quantum dot spectroscopy.

Abstract

Equations of motions and energy-momentum density tensors are
obtained for a dispersive and dissipative medium sustaining electric
and magnetic polarizations, using Lagrangian formalisms. A previous
work on the subject by the authors has been simpliﬁed by reduction
in the Lagrangian of the number of independent vector ﬁelds, with
which the sink modes (associated with the dissipation) interact. The
paper also formulates the dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the
medium in a covariant (relativistic) manner. We discuss (and compare)
the results, especially from the point of view of the positivity of the
energy density.

Introduction

Lagrangian methods provide a systematic and uniﬁed approach to dynamic
phenomena. Every mature subject in physics can and should be described

1

by a Lagrangian. To name a few: particle physics is described by the ”stan-
dard Model” Lagrangian, General relativity by the ”Curvature Scalar” La-
grangian and so on.

Nevertheless, there are some phenomenological treatments that are not
obviously expressible by a Lagrangian formalism and have led to ambigui-
ties and controversies. An instance of this is the dynamics of polarization
in dispersive-dissipative materials. While the equations of motion (shown
below in equation (10) and equation (11)) have been in frequent use, the
derivation of these equations from a Lagrangian has been wanting for some
time. As a consequence, basic quantities like energy and momentum densi-
ties, that are integral parts of the Lagrangian method, have become variously
formulated and subject to dispute. A brief account of the history of energy
densities is found in [1]. Following that account and adopting a Lagrangian
formulation, that work has unambiguously derived an expression for the
energy density.

Relativistic treatments of dissipative electromagnetic media, but not
based on a Lagrangian formalism, were given in [2]. A comparison of three
diﬀerent approaches for relativistic treatments of dissipative electromagnetic
media was undertaken in a book by Fano, Chu and Adler [3]. In this book
the authors compared the approach they endorse with two other approaches,
denoted the Minkowski and Amperian approaches. The Minkowskian ap-
proach was criticized by the authors because it assumes a linear scalar rela-
tion between the displacement ﬁeld ~D and the electric ﬁeld ~E, and between
the magnetic ﬁeld ~H and the magnetic ﬂux density ﬁeld ~B. The authors
argue that this relation is not invariant under a general Lorentz transfor-
mation and thus is not objective but subjective and can only be regarded
as true in a a particular frame of reference. Furthermore, even according
to an observer in rest with respect the electromagnetic medium, the lin-
ear scalar relations are not generally true since some magnetic materials
have a hysteresis curve and thus ~B and ~H are not linearly related, while
other materials possess a tensorial dielectric constant instead of a scalar
one. Fano, Chu & Adler also claim that the Lorentz force resulting from
the Minkowskian formalism contradicts experimental evidence regarding po-
larized and magnetized materials. The Amperian approach is criticized in
the book on the basis that the resulting Lorentz force contradicts experi-
mental evidence regarding magnetized materials. The authors of this paper
do not follow the approach of Fano, Chu & Adler, since it is not based on
a variational approach and thus one cannot canonically derive an energy
expression. Furthermore, Fano, Chu & Adler do not regard the magneti-

2

zation and polarization of a material as degrees of freedom subject to their
own dynamics; rather, these are treated as given source terms for the the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. It should be noted however, that both the en-
ergy density obtained by them and that using the Amperian approach are
positive.

Other approaches, notably for physical systems containing both vis-
cous ﬂows and electromagnetic ﬁelds are discussed by Felderhof [4] and
Rosensweig [5]. The ﬁrst work postulates an energy-momentum tensor
(equation (3.12) in [4]); in our formalism we will aim at deriving the en-
ergy momentum tensor from a Lagrangian using the well known canonical
formalism (see below). The second work [5] is based on an ”engineering”
type of approach. Rosensweig has postulated balance equations in a moving
frame for linear momentum, angular momentum and energy and has derived
”constitutive equations” using the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynam-
ics. The energy momentum tensor was not considered in this work, nor a
Lagrangian to derive the energy momentum tensor from.
It is evident that the energy density, written as T 0

0 , is a component of
the energy momentum tensor T k
j ([9]-[12]). This is uniquely derivable from
the Lagrangian density
(uk, uk,j), which is composed of the ﬁeld variables
uk and of their derivatives uk,j. (A symbol after the comma represents a
derivative.) The formal deﬁnition of the energy-momentum density is given
by

Summation is implied for repeated indexes. In our convention the indexes
take the value 0 for the time component and the numbers (1, 2, 3) for the
remaining, space components. The dot over a quantity will signify a time
derivative.

The expression for the energy found in [1] was positive. The essential idea
there was the introduction of added degrees of freedom (named sinks), which
are depositories of the the energy residing in the electromagnetic ﬁeld and in
the polarization of the medium. Physically, the sinks are macroscopic modes
of motion in the solid (and less obviously, in its surrounding) diﬀerent from
the polarization modes, but weakly interacting with them. These degrees of
freedom have been given microscopic interpretation in the thermodynamic
limit, in terms of a set of interacting oscillators with a special interaction
matrix [6]. The need to include additional degrees of freedom to treat the
irreversible behavior of polarizable systems was noted in a classic text [7].

3

The proof that any set of diﬀerential equations can be embedded in a larger
set that can be derived from a variational principle was supplied by Bateman
[8].

Our aim in the present work is twofold: ﬁrst we simplify our previous
formulation by reducing the number of vector degrees of freedom. Thus, the
formalism presented here contains two vector degrees of freedom less than
the previous one. The resulting Lagrangian is considerably simpler without
compromising the power of our formalism. Secondly, in later sections, we
give a relativistic covariant formalism, making the theory valid also in a
moving system of reference. The motivation for this is twofold:

1. It is well known that any physical theory should obey the laws of
special relativity and should be invariant under Lorentz transformation
- in this paper we construct a theory along the same lines as our
previous theory [1], which satisﬁed these requirements.

2. Our previous theory did not contain spatial derivatives of certain quan-
tities; the principle of covariance has helped us put those derivatives
in.

Further, we discuss the implications. Some of the equations in the earlier
sections have already appeared in [1]; however, they are indispensable both
for a self-contained reading of the simpliﬁed theory and as an introduction
to and comparison with the covariant theory.

2 Time independent polarizations

Our ﬁrst task is to formulate the Lagrangian density of the electromagnetic
and polarization and magnetization ﬁelds for a material whose polarization
are static. We use CGS Gaussian units. Connections between the electric
displacement ﬁeld ~D and the electric ﬁeld ~E and polarization ~P , and, like-
wise, between the magnetic ﬁeld ~H and the magnetic induction ﬁeld ~B and
magnetization ~M are then provided by the relations:

The above ﬁelds satisfy both the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations:

~D = ~E + 4π ~P .

~H = ~B

4π ~M .

div ~D = 4πρ

(5)

We further make the assumption that both free charges ρ and currents ~J
are zero.

It is not possible to derive these equations from a Lagrangian density
expressed in terms of the ﬁelds. However, this diﬃculty is traditionally
overcome by representing the ﬁelds in terms of vector ~A and scalar Φ po-
tentials, as follows:

~E =

Using these deﬁnitions one can see that the homogenous equations (4) are
satisﬁed automatically. The inhomogeneous equations (5) are the outcome
of the functional derivation of the Lagrangian below:

The last term ~M 2 can be usually discarded for static magnetization, since it
represents nothing but a time-independent constant. However, we include
it for reference in future sections, where the electric polarization and the
magnetization will become dynamic degrees of freedom.

3 Equations of motion with dissipative terms

The equations that treat the development of the polarization ~P by an applied
electric ﬁeld ~E, and the magnetization ~M as induced by an external magnetic
ﬁeld ~H are, as appearing in e.g., [13], the following:

with all symbols and notation as deﬁned in [13]. These equations hold for
0. Fourier transformed to the frequency (ω) domain, the equations for

the frequency components of the ﬁelds are written, after a transposition of
terms as

Returning now to equation (10) and equation (11), for self-consistency these
have to be supplemented by the Maxwell-equations given in the previous
section and derived from the Lagrangian of equation (7) that contain the
contravariant four-vectors Aα = ( ~A, Φ).

To take account of the dissipative nature of the processes we introduce
a set of new ﬁelds, designated canonical ﬁelds. These will be formally dis-
tinguished from the previous, physical ﬁelds by writing them in lower case
symbols. The introduction of these ﬁelds follows theories by [14] -[16]. The
canonical ﬁelds (taken to be real) are made to be part of a Lagrangian for-
mulation. We note that for the preceding physical quantities (written in
upper case symbols), this cannot be achieved [14].

To make our new notation explicit, we shall work with electric polariza-
tion pα and magnetization mα and the electromagnetic ﬁelds eα, hα and the
(contravariant) vector-potentials aα. It will be later demonstrated that these
new, canonical ﬁelds contain a time dependent factor which (partly, but not
fully) neutralizes the dissipative process. Otherwise, the choice of the ﬁelds
(and of the various constant factors) is guided by the requirement that we
recapture the form of the equations of motion and the energy density cur-
rently widely employed in solid state optics in the appropriate limiting case
of no dissipation. (This requirement impairs at times the formal symmetry
between the modes linked with the polarization and the magnetization, re-
spectively.) The physical meaning of the canonical ﬁelds will be made clear
later by comparing their equations of motion with those of the physical
ﬁelds. (For a similar procedure see [14].)

In addition, we shall introduce two new scalar ﬁelds, the so called ”sink”
ﬁelds: the ﬁrst being Ψ, that incorporates macroscopic degrees of freedom
associated with the dissipation of the polarization (analogous to the degree of
freedom denoted with the same symbol in [16]) and the second, the sink-ﬁeld
Φ which accounts for the dissipation in the magnetic mode (and originates
physically in atomic spin or angular momenta in the solid).

L
tains the Lagrangians in the polarization modes, the magnetization modes,
the electromagnetic ﬁelds, the Ψ and Φ sink ﬁelds and then the interaction-
Lagrangians between polarization and electric ﬁeld, magnetization and mag-
netic ﬁeld and, ﬁnally, the polarization and magnetization with their respec-
tive sink ﬁelds. The various terms are written out as:

having chosen the x (or 1) axis as the direction of the polarization and mag-

modes of motion (when there is no coupling to other ﬁelds.) This choice
seems to allow the simplest type of representation of unspeciﬁed (and, so
far, arbitrary) degrees of freedom. The symbols κ, ρ, λ, ν are constant, non-
negative coeﬃcients, whose values depend on the nature of the relaxation
mechanisms.

The ﬁrst-written forms are sums of squares with non-negative coeﬃcients;
this ensures that each part of the energy density is positive (non-negative).
The usual expressions for the energy density, e.g. in [12] or [13], diﬀer from
the above by the presence of the terms in Φ and Ψ and their time derivatives.
In the following section we shall eliminate these variables by making use of
the equations of motion, equation (28) and equation (29).

5 A simple solution

To work out a fully solvable case, we postulate that the coeﬃcients ρ and ν in
equation (24) and equation (25) vanish. Then the equations of motion for the
sink-modes, equation (28) and equation (29), can be integrated. We shall
carry through the electric polarization case, but an analogous development
holds for the magnetization sink-variable. We assume the following initial
conditions for Ψ(t)

Ψ(0) = 0,

˙Ψ(0) = Γe/2

With these choices the diﬀerential equation (10) is regained for short times,
t << 2
, as will be shown presently. (This is similar to the procedure in
Γe
[14]). Then, from equation (28),

A ﬁrst integration gives

One can now substitute this expression and equation (39) into equation

In the case of slow relaxation, when Γe is small (quantitatively, when Γe√κ <<

in the quantity C 2 being a small quantity of the second order, which can be

The above two expressions for the energy densities, equation (44) and equa-
tion (45), resemble those in equation (11) of Ruppin [13], except that they
are written in the canonical (small letter) variables, rather than in the phys-
ical variables (the relations between these will be presently obtained), and
that in the denominators they contain the polarization ﬁelds squared. The
role of these is to damp out ”kinetic” energy in the polarization motion,
associated with the motion of charged (or spinning) matter.

The main results of this section, equation (43) and its analogue for the
magnetization energy density, are exact and contain non-perturbative cor-
rections to the energy density, due to the presence of the sink degrees of

11

freedom. While exact, they are model dependent in the sense that sinks rep-
resented by diﬀerent Lagrangians would lead to diﬀerent energy densities.
This is clear, due to the presence in the energy densities of the parameters κ
and λ that were introduced in the Lagrangian in equation (24) and equation
(25). This outcome was anticipated some time ago in [17]. (We also note
the opposing view in [18].) It is of interest to note that the non-dissipative

Interpretation of the ﬁelds

We now ﬁnd the relation of the canonical ﬁelds to the physical ﬁelds in the
presence of dissipation and sink modes. We regain the original equations
of motion, equation (10) and equation (11), for the physical polarization
variable, as follows: We postulate

p(t) = eΨ(t)P (t)
m(t) = eΦ(t)M (t)

This turns (the vector form of) equation (26) into the following:

¨~P + 2 ˙Ψ(t)

˙~P (t) + ω2

~P = ω2

and likewise for the magnetization variables. Then, from equation (37), for
short times 0 < t << 2

We then obtain

−Ψ(t)~e

Recalling equation (10) and equation (11), we can thus extrapolate to later
times so as to identify

(49)

(50)

(51)

and regain equation (10) and equation (11). This provides a physical mean-
ing for all the ”canonical” variables, as those ﬁelds in which the decay has

~e(t) = eΨ(t) ~E(t)
~h(t) = eΦ(t) ~H(t)

12

been reinstated. On the other hand, the decay is itself dependent on the
ﬁelds. (Cf. [19].) Furthermore, the Maxwell equations for the physical ﬁelds

modiﬁed Maxwell equation) also appears in [15] and [16] (eq. (14) and eq.
(12), respectively).

7 A covariant dissipative Lagrangian density

In this section we introduce a covariant Lagrangian density which is a
Lorentz invariant generalization of the Lagrangian density described in equa-
tion (18). Again we introduce a set of new ﬁelds, which are formally dis-
tinguished from the previous, physical ﬁelds by writing them in lower case
symbols. Explicitly, we shall work with the scaled polarization and elec-
tromagnetic tensors pαβ and f αβ and other lower case quantities that were
introduced earlier. Notice that the Lagrangian introduced here will contain
less terms since both the magnetization and the polarization are now part
of the polarization tensor pαβ. This Lagrangian has the following parts:

The ﬁeld equations with respect to pαβ, Ψ and the electromagnetic ﬁelds can

already derived by taking the variational derivative of equation (89) with
respect to aα and further change is unnecessary (except for that from upper
to lower case symbols ). Taking the variational derivative of

they are complicated non-linear partial diﬀerential equations. In the follow-
ing subsection we will present a solution for a particular, simple situation.
Notice that this situation is completely diﬀerent from the situation in the

8 Conclusion

In this paper the Lagrangian method for a dissipative medium (capable
also of sustaining electric and/or magnetic polarizations) was carried out
to obtain equations of motion, energy-momentum densities, etc. To apply
the method it has been found necessary to introduce additional degrees of
freedom (”sink-modes”), associated with decay mechanisms in the electrical
and magnetic modes.

Two versions have been formulated: The ﬁrst one, which is not invariant
under Lorentz transformation, has led to equations for both the electromag-
netic ﬁelds (a slightly corrected set of Maxwell equations) , polarization and

17

magnetization and, using a model for the sink variables, has unambiguously
yielded energy densities, shown in equation (43) - equation (45). These are
positive and resemble the corresponding results in [13]. The results obtained
are similar to the ones obtained in [1], however, they have been obtained
here with a much simpler Lagrangian, containing fewer degrees of freedom.
To be precise, two vector degrees of freedom (or six independent quantities)
have been omitted from the beginning, thus making the formalism more
useful for numerical calculations.

Secondly, a covariant Lagrangian was formulated, one that is invariant
under the Lorentz transformation and contains spatial as well as tempo-
ral derivatives. From this, we have derived equations for both the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds, polarization and magnetization . Calculating the energy
momentum tensor we have derived expression for both the energy density
and the generalized Poynting vector. However, we ﬁnd that with a speciﬁc
model for the sink modes, the energy density derived from this covariant
Lagrangian is not positive deﬁnite. This points to the need to introduce a
better model for the sink degrees of freedom, perhaps with better physical
underpinning.

APPENDIX

A The covariant formalism

In a covariant formalism of the electromagnetic theory one uses a four dimen-
sional space-time formalism instead of the usual distinction that is practised
between spatial and temporal coordinates. In this formalism the invariance
of the Lagrangian of the electromagnetic theory under Lorentz transforma-
tion is clear.

A.1 Four dimensional notations

The four dimensional coordinate are deﬁned as:

x0 = ct,

x1 = x,

x2 = y,

x3 = z

In this formalism there is a diﬀerence between coordinates with upper and
lower indexes. For example:

x3 =

The connection between upper and lower coordinates is established through
the metric matrix gαβ, which is deﬁned as

A.2 Electromagnetic theory in four dimensions

The vector and scalar electromagnetic potentials are replaced by a single
four-vector

Aα = (Φ, ~A)

antisymmetirc tensors:

Furthermore, the equations appearing in (5) can be rewritten as a single

In this the four current is deﬁned as J α = (cρ, ~J ) and the subscript f refers
to free currents and charges. In what follows we assume that the material
under study does not contain any free currents or charges. The covariant

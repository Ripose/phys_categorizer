Abstract

We experimentally investigate the depolarizing power and the polarization entropy of a broad

class of scattering optical media. By means of polarization tomography, these quantities are

derived from an eﬀective Mueller matrix, which is introduced through a formal description

of the multi-mode detection scheme we use, as recently proposed by Aiello and Woerdman

(arXiv:quant-ph/0407234). This proposal emphasized an intriguing universality in the polarization

aspects of classical as well as quantum light scattering; in this contribution we demonstrate exper-

imentally that this universality is obeyed by a surprisingly wide class of depolarizing media. This,

in turn, provides the experimentalist with a useful characterization of the polarization properties

of any scattering media, as well as a universal criterion for the validity of the measured data.

INTRODUCTION

Characterization of optically transparent media with polarized-light scattering methods,

is important for communication technology, industrial and medical applications [1]. When

polarized light is incident on an optically random medium it suﬀers multiple scattering and,

as a result, it may emerge partly or completely depolarized. The amount of depolarization

can be quantiﬁed by calculating either the entropy (EF ) or the degree of polarization (PF )

of the scattered ﬁeld [2]. It is simple to show that the ﬁeld quantities EF and PF are related

by a single-valued function: EF (PF ). For example polarized light (PF = 1) has EF = 0

while partially polarized light (0

PF < 1) has 1

EF > 0. When the incident beam is

≤

≥

polarized and the output beam is partially polarized, the medium is said to be depolarizing.

An average measure of the depolarizing power of the medium is given by the so called index

of depolarization (DM ) [3]. Non-depolarizing media are characterized by DM = 1, while

depolarizing media have 0

DM < 1. A depolarizing scattering process is always accompa-

≤

nied by an increase of the entropy of the light, the increase being due to the interaction of

the ﬁeld with the medium. An average measure of the entropy that a given random medium

can add to the entropy of the incident light beam, is given by the polarization entropy EM

[4]. Non-depolarizing media are characterized by EM = 0, while for depolarizing media

quantities EM and DM .

1. As the ﬁeld quantities EF and PF are related to each other, so are the medium

In a previous paper [5] we showed the existence of a universal

relation EM (DM ) between the polarization entropy EM and the index of depolarization DM

valid for any scattering medium. More speciﬁcally, EM is related to DM by a multi-valued

function, which covers the complete regime from zero to total depolarization. This universal

relation provides a simple characterization of the polarization properties of any medium, as

well as a consistency check for the experimentally measured Mueller matrices. We emphasize

that the results found in [5] apply both to classical and quantum scattering processes, and

might therefore become relevant for quantum communication optical applications, where

depolarization is due to the loss of quantum coherence [7].

In this contribution, we present an experimental study of the depolarizing properties of a

large set of scattering media, ranging from milk to multi-mode optical ﬁbers. The results

conﬁrm the theoretical predictions for the bounds of the multi-valued function EM (DM ).

The manuscript is divided as follows: in Section II we review the Mueller-Stokes formalism

2

and show the diﬀerences between deterministic (non-depolarizing) and non-deterministic

(depolarizing) scattering media. We also discuss the statistical nature of a depolarizing

process resulting from the average (either spatial or temporal) performed in a multi-mode

detection scheme. Furthermore, in order to describe the transverse spatial average present in

our multi-mode detection set-up, we formally introduce the concept of an eﬀective Mueller

matrix (Meﬀ ). In Section III we describe the experimental scheme for polarization tomog-

raphy that was used to characterize the diﬀerent scattering samples. These can be divided

into two categories: (a) non-stationary (samples which ﬂuctuate during the measurement

time) and (b) stationary (samples which do not ﬂuctuate). We then show the experimental

results obtained for these samples followed by a brief discussion of the interesting structures

in the (EM , DM ) plane, that were revealed by the experiments. Finally, in Section IV we

draw our conclusions.

II. DEPOLARIZING AND NON-DEPOLARIZING MEDIA

In the Introduction we stressed the fact that passive optical systems may be grouped

in two broad classes: depolarizing and non-depolarizing systems. To the ﬁrst class belong

all media which decrease the degree of polarization PF of the impinging light, while to the

second one belong all media which do not decrease PF . In this Section we want to make the

discussion more quantitative by using the Mueller-Stokes formalism which is widely used for

the description of the polarization state of light beams.

A. Mueller-Stokes formalism

Consider a quasi-monochromatic beam of light of mean angular frequency ω [6]. Let

us denote with x, y, z the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system, with the z-axis along the

direction of propagation of the beam whose angular spread around z is assumed to be small

enough to satisfy the paraxial approximation. Let

respectively, at the point (x, y) located in the transverse plane z = z0 at time t0. If the ﬁeld

is uniform on the transverse plane, then Ex and Ey will be, in fact, independent of x and y

and a complete description of the ﬁeld can be achieved in terms of a doublets E of complex

variables (with possibly stochastic ﬂuctuations):

E =



,

E0
E1



where E0 and E1 are now complex-valued functions of z0 and t0 only. A complete study of

the propagation of E along z can be found, e.g., in [8], however, for our purposes the main

result we need is that propagation through non-depolarizing media can be described by a

deterministic Mueller (or Mueller-Jones) matrix M J , while to describe the propagation of a

light beam through a depolarizing medium it is necessary to use a non-deterministic Mueller

With this we mean that if E and E′ describe the polarization state of the ﬁeld immediately

before and immediately after the scatterer respectively, then they are linearly related by the

From the structure of M J follows that a deterministic medium does not depolarize, that is

Let us conclude by noticing that for deterministic media the two descriptions in terms of J

or M J are completely equivalent in the sense that the 16 real elements of M J do not contain

more information than the 4 complex elements of J.

2. Non-deterministic Mueller matrix M

A non-deterministic scatterer is, in a wide-sense, an optical systems which cannot be

described by a Mueller-Jones matrix. In this class fall all the depolarizing optical system as,

From ref.

[5] we know that EM is a multi-valued function of DM and that this depen-

dence determines some physical bounds to any polarization scattering process. The func-

tion EM (DM ) shows thus character of universality. In the next Section we shall conﬁrm this

theoretical prediction with experimental results.

B. Unpolarized light and depolarizing media

In classical optics, a light beam appears to be depolarized when its polarization direction

varies rapidly with respect to other degrees of freedom that are not measured during the

experiment (e.g. wavelength, time or position of the beam) [12]. Moreover, depolarization

occurs also when a single-mode polarization input beam is coupled with a multi-mode (either

6

spectral or spatial) system as, e.g., an optical ﬁber. In fact it is possible to identify two basic

depolarizing processes, (a) one intrinsic to the medium, and (b) one due to the measurement

scheme. In the ﬁrst case (a) non-stationary temporal ﬂuctuations of the optical properties

of the medium, for instance due to the Brownian motion of suspended particles in a liquid

[13], cause depolarization even when a single-mode detection scheme is employed (the time

average performed during the measurement is responsible for the depolarization). On the

other hand, type (b) stationary depolarizers (i.e. glass ﬁbers) do not ﬂuctuate in time and

produce light depolarization only in the presence of a multi-mode detection scheme. In this

case it is simple to build explicitly the ensemble of Mueller-Jones matrices representative of

the medium, that we introduced in the previous subsection.

To this end, let us consider the case of a scattering process in which a coupling between

polarization and spatial modes of the ﬁeld occurs and a multi-mode detection scheme is em-

ployed. This is, in fact, the case occurring for the optical ﬁbers we used. The Mueller-Stokes

formalism, is suitable for a single-mode description of the ﬁeld; however, it is possible to

extend this formalism to the case in which Nin spatial modes of the ﬁeld impinge on the

scatterer, Nout leave from it and D modes are eventually detected. We make the assump-

tion that diﬀerent spatial modes of the ﬁeld are uncorrelated, that is we do not consider

interference phenomena which are ruled out by the required linearity with respect to the

intensities of the ﬁeld [9]. Moreover, without loss of generality, we assume Nin = Nout = N.

a cascade of non-depolarizing optical elements is still a non-depolarizing optical system), a

sum, in general, is not. This causes depolarization. Moreover, since the “matrix coeﬃcients”

A(j) are non-negative, the matrix Meﬀ in Eq. (23) is an explicit version of the Mueller

matrix written in Eq. (12). Then we have shown, by an explicit derivation, how to build

the statistical ensemble representing the depolarizing medium, for this particular case.

III. DEPOLARIZATION EXPERIMENTS

A. Experimental scheme for polarization tomography

In order to measure the eﬀective Mueller matrix Meﬀ and thus the index of depolarization

DM and the entropy EM of a scattering medium, it is straightforward to follow a tomography

procedure: The light to be scattered by the sample is successively prepared in the four

polarization basis states of linear (V, H, +45◦) and circular (RHC) polarization, which are

represented by four independent input Stokes vectors Sin. For each of these input ﬁelds the

corresponding Stokes vector Sout, that represents the output ﬁeld, is obtained by measuring

the intensities of the scattered light in the same four polarization basis states. This procedure

provides the 4

4 independent parameters required to determine the 16 elements Mµν of

the Mueller matrix from Eq.(8). Note that we actually employ two additional polarization

basis states (

45◦, LHC) in our experiments and perform 6

6 measurement, which allows

×

us to reduce experimental errors by averaging within the over-complete data set.

×

−

The experimental scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1. The light source is a power-stabilized

9

He-Ne laser at 633 nm wavelength. The input ﬁeld is prepared by the polarizer unit (PU),

consisting of a ﬁxed polarizer (P1), a half-wave plate (H1), and a quarter-wave plate (Q1).

A microscope objective (MO,

50/0.55) couples the light into the sample. The scattered

×

light is collimated by a standard photographic objective (PO, 50 mm/1.9), followed by an

adjustable pinhole (PH) that deﬁnes the amount of transverse spatial average to be per-

formed in the light detection. The analyzer unit (AU) consists of a quarter-wave plate (Q2)

and a polarizer (P2). Together with a focusing lens (L) and a photodiode (PD), it probes

the polarization state of the scattered output ﬁeld. As an estimation of the systematic error

of the set-up, mainly due to imperfections of the used retarders, we measured the Mueller

matrix of air (i.e. the identity matrix) and of well-known deterministic optical elements such

as wave-plates. In all these cases, we found the deviations from the theoretically predicted

matrix elements limited to

∆Mµν| ≤ ±

|

0.04.

B. Collection of scattering media

The various scattering media we investigated can be divided into (a) non-stationary

samples where, e.g., Brownian motion induces temporal ﬂuctuations within the detection

integration time, and (b) stationary samples without such ﬂuctuations, most notably multi-

mode polymer and glass optical ﬁbers. More speciﬁcally, we chose our scatterers from:

– polystyrene microspheres (2 µm dia., suspended in water, Duke Scientiﬁc Co.,

(a) Non-stationary media:

USA).

– diluted milk;

(b) Stationary media:

Germany);

Optics Co., USA);

– ZenithTM polymer sheet diﬀusers (100 µm thick, SphereOptics Hoﬀman GmbH,

– holographic light shaping diﬀusers (0.5◦, 1◦, 5◦, and 10◦ scattering angle, Physical

– quartz/silica wedge depolarizers and quartz Lyot depolarizers, Halbo Optics, UK);

10

– step-index polymer optical ﬁber (NA=0.55, core dias. 250 µm, 500 µm, 750 µm

ESKA CK type, Mitsubishi Rayon, Japan);

– step-index glass optical ﬁber (NA=0.48, core dias. 200 µm, 400 µm, 600 µm

FT-x-URT type, distributed by Thorlabs, Inc., USA);

– step-index glass optical ﬁber (NA=0.22, core dia. 50 µm, ASF50 type, distributed

by Thorlabs, Inc., USA);

– graded-index glass optical ﬁber (NA=0.27, core dia. 62, 5 µm, GIF625 type,

distributed by Thorlabs, Inc., USA).

C. Experimental results

For a large collection of diﬀerent samples, Fig. 2 shows the measured polarization entropy

EM vs. the corresponding index of depolarization DM . The black lines represent the calcu-

lated analytical boundaries in the (EM , DM ) plane, whose functional dependence EM (DM )

was derived in Ref. [5]. These boundaries provide universal constraints to the possible values

(EM , DM ) for any physical scattering system, that is, the range of admissible values is re-

stricted to the rather limited grey-shaded area within the boundaries. As it is apparent from

the experimental data, our choice of samples allowed us to widely ﬁll in the range of values

(EM , DM ), in good agreement with the prediction from Ref. [5]. For rather diﬀerent scatter-

ing media, we observed similar values of the pairs (EM , DM ), which display the universality

in this quantitative description of the depolarizing properties. We found samples throughout

the full range of values in entropy and depolarizing power, 0

EM , DM ≤

≤

1. However, note

that the region below the curve connecting the points A and C in the (EM , DM ) plane is

not covered by any data so far. Work is in progress to investigate this peculiarity.

Several scatterer-speciﬁc tuning parameters allowed us to realize this wide range of depolar-

izing systems and to reveal details of the depolarizing properties for the various media, as

will be discussed in the following subsection.

The most versatile scatterers used to acquire data in the (EM , DM ) plane, were the multi-

mode optical ﬁbers. For them, the depolarization is caused by multiple reﬂections within

the cylindrical light-guide together with mode mixing. We selected ﬁbers of various lengths

that displayed the full range between non-depolarizing and completely depolarizing prop-

eﬀective Mueller matrices Meﬀ. In fact, a small pinhole, corresponding to an average over a

small set of modes j in Eq. (23), leads to a large index of depolarization. However, due to

the huge optical mode volume in our ﬁbers, the pinhole adjustment allowed only for small

special care was taken to select a suﬃciently large number of speckles in the scattered out-

put ﬁeld. (The step-index glass ﬁber with 50 µm core showed the largest speckles of about

500 µm FWHM.) This is necessary in order to average out interference eﬀects, generated

by the coherent source (He-Ne laser), so that the assumption of uncorrelated modes in the

derivation of Meﬀ holds [16].

D. Discussion

In Fig. 3, we separately show the results for (a) step-index polymer ﬁbers, (b) step-index

and graded-index glass ﬁbers, and (c) other scattering media. For the polymer ﬁbers it

is apparent that most of the data fall on the upper curve connecting the points A and

D. This curve corresponds to Mueller matrices that have an associated operator H with

its four eigenvalues of the degenerate form

λ, µ, µ, µ

. This degeneracy can be associated

{

}

with isotropic depolarizers, which is obviously a good description for the polymer ﬁbers.

Contrarily, in Fig. 3(b) (glass ﬁbers), we ﬁll in also the allowed (EM , DM ) domain below

the isotropy curve. These domains correspond to anisotropic media, the anisotropy being

supposedly due to stress-induced birefringence in the glass ﬁbers. It was actually this bire-

fringence which we used as an additional tuning parameter accounting for changes of a few

percent in the index of depolarization. The data obtained for long ﬁber samples, both in

polymer and glass, are close to the cuspidal point A (λ = µ = 1/4), which corresponds to

total depolarizers. Contrarily, the data for very short ﬁber samples are close to the cuspidal

point D (λ = 1, µ = 0), which corresponds to a deterministic (i.e. non-depolarizing) system.

In case of watery suspensions such as milk and microspheres, we observed purely isotropic

depolarization, i.e. all data are found on the isotropic curve, similar to the polymer optical

ﬁbers (see Fig. 3(c)). We adjusted the depolarizing power by varying the concentration of
the scatterers. The 100 µm thick ZenithTM polymer diﬀuser sheet was found to be almost

completely depolarizing, whereas the holographic diﬀusers, when used alone, did not cause

any signiﬁcant depolarization. The latter eﬀect is due to the absence of multiple scattering

in the transmission of light through these surface-optical elements. In combination with a

subsequent wave-plate we could, however, couple the scattered light angular spectrum to

the polarization degrees of freedom, and thus achieve depolarization.

Finally, the data for standard wedge and Lyot depolarizers are also shown in Fig. 3(c).

Wedge depolarizers are designed to completely depolarize a well deﬁned linear input po-

larization, whereas our tomographic measurement procedure represents an average over all

independent input polarizations. This results in a non-zero index of depolarization. The

Lyot depolarizer is, within the experimental error, non-depolarizing since it is designed to

depolarize a broadband light source while we operated with a monochromatic laser source.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

By means of polarization tomography we have experimentally characterized the depolar-

izing properties for a large set of scattering optical media. We describe these media with

both the index of depolarization DM and the polarization entropy EM that is added by

the medium to the scattered ﬁeld. These quantities are derived from a measured eﬀective

Mueller matrix, which we formally introduce in the description of scattering systems

subject to a multi-mode detection, as is the case of our experimental conﬁguration. The

set of studied media ranges from non-stationary scatterers such as milk and polystyrene

microspheres to stationary scatterers such as multi-mode optical ﬁbers, diﬀusers, and

standard wedge depolarizers.

In Ref. [5] a universality was predicted for the possible values of EM and DM , these values

being restricted to a limited domain described by a set of analytical boundaries. The

collected experimental data for our scatterers ﬁll in this domain almost completely and give

evidence of the predicted depolarization universality in light scattering. A certain range of

the predicted (EM , DM ) values is, however, not covered by the scatterers we investigated so

far. Work on this issue is currently under progress.

Furthermore, the quantities DM and EM provide insights into the particular depolarization

mechanisms of the various media, as well as a consistency check for the measured data (see

[16]), and may provide a useful classiﬁcation of optical scatterers for quantum applications,

where depolarization stands for decoherence [7]. In this spirit, an extension to twin photon

quantum scattering experiments is relatively straight-forward. Work along this line is also

under progress in our group.

We have greatly beneﬁted from many discussions with Martin van Exter and with Eric

Abstract

The eﬀect of the Kerr nonlinearity on linear non-diﬀractive Bessel beams is inves-
tigated analytically and numerically using the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The
nonlinearity is shown to primarily aﬀect the central parts of the Bessel beam, giving
rise to radial compression or decompression depending on whether the nonlinear-
ity is focusing or defocusing, respectively. The dynamical properties of Gaussian-
truncated Bessel beams are also analysed in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity. It
is found that although a condition for width balance in the root-mean-square sense
exists, the beam proﬁle becomes strongly deformed during propagation and may
exhibit the phenomena of global and partial collapse.

1 Introduction

Diﬀractive spreading of waves is a classical phenomenon in wave dynamics and
an inherent feature of beam propagation. Much attention has been devoted
to the possibility of counteracting the dispersive spreading by focusing eﬀects
due to medium nonlinearities e.g. the Kerr eﬀect, cf. [1]. However, it has
also been pointed out, [2], that non-diﬀracting beams are possible also in
linear media. In particular, the Helmholz equation that governs the linear
diﬀractive dynamics of a wave beam allows classes of diﬀraction-free solutions.
In addition to the plane wave solutions, the two-dimensional counterparts, the
cylindrically symmetric Bessel solutions, also propagate with preserved form,
while also allowing for a concentrated beam proﬁle. The drawback from an
application point of view is the fact that these beams have inﬁnite energy,
and consequently cannot be realized physically. Various ways to circumvent
this problem have been suggested, the most obvious being to truncate the
Bessel beam at some radius e.g. by a Gaussian truncation, forming the so

called Bessel-Gauss beams, [3]. While such a truncation clearly reintroduces
diﬀraction, the beam broadening could be made small if the propagation length
is kept smaller than the corresponding diﬀraction length of the Bessel-Gauss
beam. In particular, since the Bessel beam diﬀracts sequentially, starting with
the outer lobes, cf. [4], the central part of the beam remains intact for a certain
distance of propagation.

Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear eﬀects in connection
with Bessel and Bessel-Gauss beams, [5,6,7,8]. Of special interest for the
present investigation is the attention given to media with an intensity de-
pendent refractive index, i.e., Kerr media, see e.g. [7]. The work carried out
in [7] considers the limit of weak nonlinearity, which makes it possible to use
a perturbation approach involving an expansion around the lowest order lin-
ear (stationary) Bessel solution for solving the evolution equation, being the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.

In the present paper, we investigate in more detail the nonlinear generalisa-
tion of the linear diﬀraction-less Bessel beam solutions as well as the nonlinear
dynamics of Bessel-Gauss beams. Stationary solutions in two dimensions are
determined by the Bessel equation modiﬁed by a nonlinear term, i.e., the radi-
ally symmetric nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The modiﬁed Bessel solutions,
the “nonlinear Bessel beams”, are studied using approximate analytical and
numerical methods. The results show that the nonlinearity primarily aﬀects
the central high intensity parts of the beam proﬁle, which become radially
compressed or decompressed depending on whether the nonlinearity is fo-
cusing or defocusing, respectively. The beam proﬁle for large radii remains
a Bessel function with a phase shift being the only remaining eﬀect of the
nonlinearity. However, for the defocusing nonlinearity an amplitude threshold
exists, above which no solutions decaying to zero exist.

The dynamical properties of Gaussian-truncated Bessel beams in the presence
of a Kerr nonlinearity are also studied. An exact analytical solution was pre-
viously found for the linear dynamics of the Bessel-Gauss beams, [3]. Based
on the virial theorem, which gives an exact analytical description of the vari-
ation of the beam width in the root-mean-square (RMS) sense, important
information about the eﬀect of the nonlinearity on the beam dynamics can
be obtained. In particular, it is found that a focusing nonlinearity tends to
cause an evolution stage where the central parts of the Bessel beams are
initially compressed. Depending on the strength of the nonlinearity, diﬀerent
scenarios are possible, e.g. the subsequent evolution may involve an essentially
diﬀraction-dominated behaviour, but for increasing nonlinearity, two forms of
collapse may appear. Either a part of the beam collapses, while the RMS width
of the beam still increases, or above a certain threshold, the RMS width goes
to zero in a ﬁnite distance. Numerical simulations of the dynamics illustrate
the diﬀerent scenarios.

2 The nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation

The propagation of an optical wave in a nonlinear Kerr medium is described
by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. This implies that the slowly varying
wave envelope, ψ(z, r), of a cylindrically symmetric beam satisﬁes the following
equation

where z is the distance of propagation, k0 is the wave number in vacuum, and
κ is the nonlinear parameter. Additional physical eﬀects, e.g. attenuation and
gain, can be modelled by using complex coeﬃcients in Eq. (1). The obtained
complex equation, which in one dimension has analytical soliton solutions, [9],
is the cylindrical generalisation of the Pereira-Stenﬂo equation. It has been
investigated using a variational approach, [10], but further work is needed
to fully describe the complex case. In the present work, the coeﬃcients are
assumed to be real. It is convenient to introduce the normalisation ˜r = r/a0,
where a0 is a characteristic width of the beam, and ˜z = z/LD, where LD ≡
2k0a2

0 is the Rayleigh length. Eq. (1) then takes the form

where ˜κ = LDκ. For simplicity we will suppress the tilde in the subsequent
expressions.

We begin the analysis by looking for stationary solutions of Eq. (2). For this
purpose we write ψ = ψ(z, r) = A(r) eiδz, which leads to the eigenvalue equa-
tion

This equation is to be solved subject to the boundary conditions that the so-
lution should be ﬁnite when r = 0 and go to zero as r
. The lowest order
solution in the physical situation when the nonlinearity balances the diﬀrac-
tion, i.e., the focusing case with κ > 0, corresponds to the so called Townes
soliton [11], which has essentially the same properties and sech-shaped form as
the one-dimensional soliton solution, cf. [12]. In particular, this solution only
exists for negative eigenvalues, which are uniquely related to the maximum
amplitude.

The Bessel beams are the solutions of the linear Schr¨odinger equation (κ = 0)
and are given by A(r) = A0J0(√δ r). Clearly, well-behaved solutions exist
only for positive eigenvalues δ. In contrast to the nonlinear case, the linear
eigenvalue problem has a continuous set of (positive) eigenvalues, which are
independent of the amplitude of the beam proﬁle. The ﬁrst task of the present
analysis is to analyse the nonlinear Bessel beams, being the solutions of Eq. (3)
for positive δ and κ

3 Nonlinear Bessel beams

In order to analyse the properties of the nonlinear Bessel beams analytically
it is instructive to start by examining the central part of the pulse, which is
determined by √δ r
1. Since the initial derivative of A(r) must be zero,
we have the approximation A(r) = A0 + O(r2), which implies that to second
order in r, Eq. (3) can be approximated by the linear equation

with the corresponding solution

A = A0J0(

0 r).

q

This solution is valid for small r only, but nevertheless gives important infor-
mation about the nonlinear modiﬁcations of the Bessel beam. In the focusing
case (κ > 0), the main lobe tends to be compressed and we expect that the
amplitude of the nonlinear Bessel beam will oscillate more rapidly than the
linear Bessel beam. On the other hand, in the defocusing case (κ < 0), the
main lobe should become wider and the nonlinear solution should oscillate
slower than the linear one. In particular, if the amplitude is chosen to fulﬁl

δ + κA2

0 < 0,

the expression under the square root will be negative. This corresponds to
the modiﬁed Bessel function, which is growing with r. Thus the presence of a
defocusing nonlinearity can qualitatively change the behaviour of the solution.

It is clear that if the second derivative of A is positive initially, it will remain
positive. This can be seen by rewriting the equation as

d2A

+ δeﬀ A = 0,

δ + κA2. If δeﬀ is negative at r = 0, the solution will be growing
where δeﬀ ≡
for small r and δeﬀ will be further decreased. This increases the derivative of
the solution, and implies that a suﬃciently strong defocusing nonlinear term
will give rise to a monotonically growing solution, which is not compatible
with the condition at inﬁnity.

A more accurate description of the main lobe of the solution can be obtained
using variational analysis and Ritz optimisation, cf. [12]. When using varia-
tional analysis, it is important to ﬁnd a good set of trial functions that gives
tractable calculations while maintaining suﬃcient accuracy. A trial function
that should approximate the main lobe of the nonlinear Bessel beam reason-
ably well is

where j0 is the ﬁrst zero of the Bessel function. This also has the advantage
that the exact linear result is recovered in the limit κ

procedure, we assume r0 to be given and consider A0 as a free parameter. The
Lagrangian corresponding to Eq. (3) is

By setting κ = 0, the linear result √δ r0 = j0 is recovered. If κ is positive the
value of r2
0 is decreased, which corresponds to compression of the main lobe.
A negative κ gives the opposite eﬀect. This result conﬁrms the previously
obtained picture of the eﬀects of the nonlinearity on the main lobe of the
linear Bessel solution.

The result of the variational analysis is compared with numerical solutions in
Figs. 1 and 2. Diﬀerent r0-values have been used, and they are easily identi-
ﬁed in the ﬁgures, since the variational approximation is zero when r = r0.
For clarity the plotted curves have been normalised with respect to their am-
plitudes at r = 0. It is seen that the Bessel ansatz represents a rather good
approximation in the focusing case, but that the presence of the nonlinearity
changes the shape for small r, making it more peaked than the Bessel pro-
ﬁle. In the defocusing case, the nonlinear solution instead has a ﬂatter form
than the linear Bessel function, Fig. 2. It is also seen that for increasing r0, or
equivalently increasing A0, the approximation deteriorates. This is due to the
fact that in this case there exists a threshold value for the amplitude in order
to have well-behaved solutions, cf. (7). The critical value for the amplitude
is A0 = 1. The variational result also predicts this behaviour, although, as is
inferred from Eq. (14), the critical value is found to be slightly diﬀerent

Clearly, as A(0) approaches the threshold value, which is unity, we expect the
accuracy of the variational approximation to deteriorate.

We now turn to an investigation of the overall behaviour of the nonlinear
Bessel beam proﬁles. The fact that the main inﬂuence of the nonlinear term
is a rescaling of the radial coordinate makes it reasonable to look for an ap-
proximate solution of the form

where f (r) is a function of r, δ, κ, and A0. It is diﬃcult to determine f using
analytical methods, but by noticing that the linear solution can be written as

Although this is, in fact, an integral equation for A(r), it nevertheless provides
a very simple formula for ﬁnding A numerically. The corresponding approx-
imate solution is compared to the numerical solution of the full equation in
Fig. 3. When the amplitude is low the two curves are identical, since the ansatz
then reduces to the Bessel function. In the case of a focusing nonlinearity, there
is good agreement between the two approaches, but it is also seen that a phase
shift appears between the curves for increasing A0. Quite good agreement is
seen also in the defocusing case. In particular, the initial ﬂattening is well
modelled. The phase shift is now of the opposite sign.

r

This approximate solution implies that the argument of the Bessel function
0 √δ + κA2 dr′, which is a nonlinear generalisation
increases approximately as
of the linear case. Thus the main eﬀect of a focusing nonlinearity is to increase
R
the curvature of the peaks by increasing the growth rate of the argument,
making the solution radially compressed. In the defocusing case the curvature
is decreased, which is most clearly seen in the main lobe.

4 Analysis of nonlinear Bessel-Gauss beams

The linear diﬀraction properties of Bessel-Gauss beams have been analysed
and solved analytically, see [3]. In the present section we will analyse the
nonlinear dynamics of beams, which initially have a proﬁle in the form of
a Bessel function truncated by a Gaussian. Since a general solution of this
problem cannot be given, we will use the virial theorem to obtain analytical
information and numerical simulations for determining the evolution of the
beam proﬁle.

The virial theorem, see e.g. [13,14,15], provides exact and explicit information
about the dynamic variation of the width of the beam, σ, deﬁned in the RMS
sense as σ2

This means the invariants correspond to the (integrated) beam intensity and

ψ(0, r). For initial phase functions that do not depend on r, the linear term
in z vanishes, and the beam width varies as

Clearly this approach cannot be used for analysing the linear, or the nonlin-
early modiﬁed, stationary Bessel beam solutions of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation since all integrals involved in the virial theorem are inﬁnite. However,
for a physical beam, with ﬁnite integral content, the virial theorem is useful.
In general it is seen that with weak nonlinear focusing eﬀects, the Hamiltonian
is positive and the RMS width will increase quadratically with a characteristic
diﬀraction length given by L0. When the amplitude of the beam increases, the
Hamiltonian decreases and eventually changes sign. This implies that the RMS
width goes to zero after a ﬁnite length equal to L0—the well known nonlinear
collapse phenomenon, where L0 now plays the role of collapse length.

with D2 ≈
ρ0, i.e., the diﬀraction is determined solely by the truncation
simply as L0 ∝
radius and as ρ0 → ∞
, the non-diﬀracting Bessel beam is recovered. For
increasing values of the nonlinearity parameter, Λ, but for a ﬁxed truncation
radius, the value of L0 increases and for a certain critical value of Λ, the
nonlinearity balances the diﬀraction to give a Bessel-Gauss beam, which is
diﬀraction-less in the RMS sense.

5 Dynamics of Bessel-Gauss beams

When a truncated linear Bessel-Gauss beam propagates, the diﬀraction ini-
tially aﬀects only the outermost part of the pulse, where the truncation has
changed it from the Bessel shape. The central parts are initially diﬀraction bal-
anced and remains so until the “diﬀraction front” propagating inwards from
the outer parts eventually reach the inner lobes and also these parts start
to diﬀract outwards. On the other hand, the nonlinear eﬀect is strongest at
the centre of the beam, where the intensity is highest, and with a focusing
nonlinear term, the main lobe will start to compress. In fact, it will start to
compress irrespective of the degree of nonlinearity since the linear diﬀraction
is already balanced. If the nonlinear eﬀect is weak the compression will even-
tually stop, and diﬀraction will become the dominating eﬀect. This evolution
is illustrated in Fig. 6, where an FDTD simulation using A0 = 1 and µ = 0.01
is shown. Although the central parts initially compress, the virial theorem pre-
dicts beam broadening in the RMS sense. Clearly this is no contradiction since
the broadening of the outer parts more than compensate the compression of
the centre. In order to further illustrate how the main lobe is compressed, the
intensity at r = 0 has been plotted for diﬀerent initial amplitudes as a func-
tion of propagation distance in Fig. 7. The curves have been normalised with

respect to their amplitudes at r = 0 and µ = 0.01. We emphasise the oscillat-
ing behaviour for the highest amplitudes. If the nonlinear eﬀect is suﬃciently
strong, the virial theorem predicts a collapse of the beam to zero RMS width.
According to Eq. (33), the amplitude threshold for this type of behaviour is
2.26 for µ = 0.01. It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of
A0 > Ac ≈
two-dimensional beams may lead to a break up of the beam into a diﬀracting
background proﬁle with a monotonously compressing ﬁlament, that collapses
in a ﬁnite distance of propagation. Thus, the width of the ﬁlament goes to zero
and the intensity becomes inﬁnite whereas the beam width in the RMS sense
still increases. The simulations for the present case of Bessel-Gauss beams
show that when the amplitude is increased further above A0 = 1, the small
second peak of Fig. 7 will start to dominate and eventually the simulations
indicate a collapse of the second peak, although the RMS width still tends to
inﬁnity. In fact, even if the RMS width remains constant, the beam should
still be able to undergo partial collapse.

Much eﬀort has been devoted to the study of two-dimensional collapse phe-
nomena induced by the Kerr nonlinearity, see e.g. [13,14,15] and references
therein. In particular, it has been found that the virial theorem poses a suf-
ﬁcient but not necessary condition for the occurrence of a singularity where
the amplitude becomes inﬁnite. Thus the appearance of a partial collapse sin-
gularity below the threshold for a global collapse, as predicted by the virial
theorem, is in accordance with earlier results.

6 Conclusions

Based on the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in cylindrical geometry we have
studied the modiﬁcation of the diﬀraction-less linear Bessel beams caused by
the nonlinear Kerr eﬀect. The stationary as well as the dynamic properties
of the solutions to this equation have been analysed and both analytical and
numerical techniques have been used. The investigation shows that the non-
linearity primarily aﬀects the main and inner lobes of the Bessel beams. In
the case of the stationary solutions, the central region of the nonlinear Bessel
beam tends to become radially more narrow or more extended depending on
whether the nonlinearity is focusing or defocusing, respectively. Asymptoti-
cally the solutions are still of the same oscillating form as the diﬀraction-less
Bessel beams, the only remaining feature of the nonlinearity being a phase
shift as compared to the linear case. However, in the case of the defocusing
nonlinearity, there is a ﬁnite amplitude threshold for well-behaved solutions to
exist. Above this limit the nonlinear diﬀraction eﬀect becomes larger than the
linear eﬀect, which counteracts the diﬀraction, and no solutions are possible
which vanish at inﬁnity.

The properties of Gaussian-truncated Bessel beams have also been studied in
the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity. It has been shown, using the virial the-
orem, that a non-diﬀracting situation in the RMS sense is possible to obtain
by balancing nonlinear focusing and linear diﬀraction. However, this situation
does not correspond to a stationary case of the beam proﬁle. Signiﬁcant re-
distribution of the beam occurs and using numerical simulations, the dynamic

14

interaction between linear diﬀraction and nonlinear focusing has been anal-
ysed for varying degrees of nonlinearity. It has been found that, in particular
the central parts of the beam may become signiﬁcantly distorted and may even
partially collapse even though the beam width, deﬁned in the RMS sense, re-
mains constant or even increases. This result is in agreement with the classical
picture of dynamic self focusing of two-dimensional beams in nonlinear Kerr
media.

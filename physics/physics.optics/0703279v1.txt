(Dated: February 9, 2014)

We numerically demonstrate eﬀectively strong diamagnetic resonance at visible frequencies in
stratiﬁed metal-dielectric metamaterials. The eﬀective optical constants are extracted by two com-
plex reﬂectivity method. It is clariﬁed that the eﬀective diamagnetic response emerges at eﬀective
plasma frequency and originates from mesoscopic stratiﬁed layers of thin metals. Consequently, the
diamagnetic response is regarded as a collective excitation in mesoscopic scale. In addition, it is
shown that the diamagnetic resonance is spatially dispersive and the diamagnetism is sensitive to
the surface layer.

Photonic metamaterials are trials to invent and pro-
duce novel electromagnetic (EM) states by modifying pe-
riodic structures in which constituents have the same op-
tical constants with bulk materials. The trials start at
gigahertz and proceed to terahertz and optical frequen-
cies with remarkable progress reviewed in Refs. [1, 2].
The strategy is mainly based on the control of geometri-
cal structures in metamaterials, is to seek novel eﬀective
EM states which are solutions of Maxwell equations for a
homogenized system obtained by coarse-graining, and is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from nano-scale materials science
in which quantum size eﬀect on electronic states is a key.
Magnetization in visible frequency range is a tough ob-
ject and had been considered to be unrealistic due to the
description in a famous textbook [3]. Recently, metal-
lic structures of sprit-ring resonators (SRR) [4, 5], per-
forated metal-dielectric-metal layers [6], and short wire
pairs [7] become candidates to be exceptions in visible
range to the statement by Landau and Lifshitz [3]. Some
of the results are based on experimental examination
[6, 7], and revealed the resonant and anti-resonant be-
havior of permittivity and permeability [8]. As a result,
the EM states in metamaterials turn out quite compli-
cated and lossy.

A simple theoretical analysis presented a possibility of
negative refractive index in a thin metal ﬁlm [9] and the
sub-diﬀraction-limited image was shown experimentally
[10].
It is expected that near-EM-ﬁeld enhancement is
induced to compensate the loss at resonance with ex-
ploiting thin metallic layers. Another experimental re-
sult was reported which supports the enhancement by
stratiﬁed thin metals [11]. Besides, it was very recently
argued that negative refractive response appears in strat-
iﬁed stacks composed of metal-dielectric several layers
[12]. Thus, the magnetic response in metallic thin ﬁlms
attracts great interest, connecting to optics with negative
refraction.

In the present Communication, we specify stratiﬁed
metal-dielectric metamaterials (SMDM) to examine ef-

fective magnetic response at visible frequencies. The
schematic drawing of SMDM and the coordinate conﬁgu-
ration are shown in Fig. 1. Since the structure is uniaxial,
eﬀective tensors of permittivity ε and permeability µ are
assumed to be diagonal and uniaxial:

ε = 


εx 0
0
0 εy 0
0 εz
0





, µ = 


µx 0
0
0 µy 0
0 µz

.





(1)

The tensors are also assumed to describe local EM re-
sponses. The optical axis is set z axis, and then the two
relations of εx = εy and µx = µy hold in Eq. (1). The
periodicity is taken 75 nm. The thickness of metal (Ag)
and dielectric (MgF2) are 15 and 60 nm, respectively.
The thickness of silver layers was set to ensure using di-
electric constant of bulk silver in literature [13].

We concentrate on bulk SMDM which is thick enough
to eliminate transmission, and extract full components
of ε and µ tensors by two complex reﬂectivity method
(TCRM). Although the method and numerical details
were described already [14], we brieﬂy survey the scheme
in the following. Complex reﬂectivity rs under s polar-

where ˆkz(θ) is the z component of refractive wavenum-

particular, ˆkz(0) is refractive index along z axis. Besides,
n0 and µ0 denote the refractive index and permeability
in vacuum. Equation of dispersion under s polarization
is written as

where ˆkx(θ) = n0 sin θ in the conﬁguration of Fig. 1. Set-
ting the right hand side of Eq. (2) to be fs(θ) and com-
bining Eqs. (2) and (3), we obtain the next equation:

Two diﬀerent angles (θ1 6= θ2) derive sin θ1 6= sin θ2,
and enable to evaluate εy/µx and µxµz uniquely. By
permutating the conﬁguration (x, y, z) → (y, z, x), we
can ﬁgure εz/µy and µyµx. Since the relations of εx = εy
and µx = µy are assumed for SMDM, µ2
x is evalated;
succeedingly, the rest components of µz, εx, and εz are
uniquely obtained except for the sign. We set the sign
of µx to be µx ≈ 1 at oﬀ-resonant energy of 1.5 eV and
identify the sign without discontinuous jump as shown in
Fig. 2. The precision in the computation for rs ensures
that the full components of tensors are determined within
a-few-percent numerical error.

Figure 2 presents the full components of (a) ε and (b) µ
tensors extracted by TCRM with the two angles of 0◦ and
15◦. Other sets of two incident angles (0◦ and θ 6= 0◦)
result in the same spectra of εx, εz, and µx within a nu-
merical error. In TCRM analysis using Eq. (4) and the
angle pair (0◦,θ), it is easily found that µz depends only
on θ; therefore, we can extract µz(θ) at oblique angle.
Thus, all the components of ε and µ tensors are deter-
mined in a well-deﬁned manner at visible frequencies in
Fig. 2.

The εx component has typical dispersion of Drude
metal (upper solid and dotted lines in Fig. 2(a):
the
real and imaginary parts of εx, respectively), and the
eﬀective plasma frequency ωp,eﬀ, which is deﬁned by
Re(εx(ωp,eﬀ)) = 0, is located at ωp,eﬀ = 2.6 eV. On the
other hand, the εz spectrum exhibits typical dielectric
properties for the incident light of Ein||z (lower solid and
dotted lines in Fig. 2(a): the real and imaginary parts of
εz, respectively). Concerning permeability components,
µx is close to 1 at 1.5–3.5 eV (upper solid and dotted lines
in Fig. 2(b): the real and imaginary parts of µx, respec-
tively), while µz goes down to 0.57 at 2.6 eV and indicates
strong diamagnetism (lower solid and dotted lines in Fig.
2(b): the real and imaginary parts of µz, respectively).
Refractive indexes along x and z axes are shown in Fig.

Re(nx) and Im(nx), and the lower solid and dotted lines
respectively stand for Re(nz) and Im(nz). The imaginary
parts of nx and nz are small above ωp,eﬀ, and correspond
to eﬃcient EM-wave propagation.

In Fig. 3, we examine the validity of description by
eﬀective refractive index. The interface of vacuum and
SMDM is set at z = 0 and incident light of 2.65 eV il-
luminates on xy plane normally. Solid lines denote (a)
electric and (b) magnetic ﬁelds of incident light in vac-
uum (z < 0); they represent refractive components of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in SMDM (z > 0). Dashed
lines present the eﬀective ﬁeld proﬁles calculated by us-
ing nz in Fig. 2(c) and reproduce the proﬁles in SMDM
well. It is thus conﬁrmed that the eﬀective description
works well in the visible range of interest.

As shown in Fig. 2, diamagnetic response is detected
in µz. This implies that magnetic induction Bz and mag-
netic ﬁeld Hz behave in a diﬀerent way. Figure 4 displays
the image plot of (a) Bz and (b) Hz at 2.65 eV. Arrows

to inner multi-reﬂection is not negligible. When the EM
ﬁelds are monochromatic plane waves and proportional
to exp(ik · r − iωt), the computation for Bz is carried out
from one of Maxwell equations:

Magnetic ﬁeld Hz is also calculated from

iωB = ik × E.

ik × H = −iωD.

Figure 4 obviously shows that the directions of Bz and
Hz are opposite in metallic layer (20 < z < 35 nm). Di-
electric layers behave like paramagnetic materials. Be-
sides, the Hz component in the metallic layer is far more
intense than the Hz in vacuum and dielectric layers. In
this way, the metallic layers act as if they are diamag-
netic materials. The diamagnetic nature does not come
from electronic spin states of silver but from superim-
posed magnetic ﬁeld in mesoscopic structure of SMDM.
The backward component is indeed responsible for the
diamagnetic response.
In this sense, the diamagnetic
response is eﬀectively induced by the structure in the
metamaterial and is actually extracted by using eﬀective
optical constants. We can thus draw a concise picture by
eﬀective description.

Figure 5 shows the dependence of µz on incident an-
gle. Employing the two angles of 0◦ and θ(6= 0◦), the
extracted µz depends only on θ, as is easily veriﬁed from
Eq. (4). The other components (µx, εx, and εz) are al-
most independent of θ. Therefore, the µz spectra in Fig. 5
can be interpreted as the indication of spatial dispersion,
that is, µz = µz(k) where k is the wavenumber vector
in SMDM. As is shown in Fig. 4, the eﬀective diamag-
netic response is generated in the mesoscopic structure
of SMDM and moreover emerges at ωp,eﬀ. Consequently,
the eﬀective diamagnetic response is regarded as mag-
netic component of collective excitation at ωp,eﬀ. Note
that µz at oﬀ-resonance below 2.3 eV is almost indepen-

dent of θ and the spatial dispersion is a resonant behav-
ior.

Figure 6 displays the eﬀect of surface layer on the ef-
fective µz. Figures 2–5 are the results regarding the sur-
face thickness d = 20 nm; the spectra is shown again
in Fig. 6. From bottom to top, the thickness d varies
from 0 to 30 nm, respectively. SMDMs with d = 0 and
10 nm show diamagnetic property in a wide frequency
range. The increase of surface thickness d gradually can-
cels diamagnetic response and ﬁnally eliminate the dia-
magnetism at d = 30 nm. Since the surface layer directly
aﬀects the phase of EM wave in SMDM, it is crucially
signiﬁcant how to set the surface layer in realizing the
diamagnetism. Figure 6 is the explicit indication, which
is consistent with the conclusion in a recent numerical
study [15], showing that the interfaces play a vital role
in photonic slabs of ﬁnite thickness, in extracting eﬀec-
tive constants.

As is shown in Figs. 4 and 6, the eﬀective diamag-
netic response emerges at ωp,eﬀ, comes from the stratiﬁed
metallic layers, and is directly connected to the surface
layer in SMDM. In other words, the diamagnetic reso-
nance is induced in the mesoscopic structure including
the surface layer. Indeed, as the ωp,eﬀ shifts with vary-
ing the ratio of metal in the unitcell, the diamagnetic
resonance follows the shift of ωp,eﬀ. Furthermore, it is
spatially dispersive as indicated in Fig. 5. Although there
is not yet general theory to elucidate the relation of EM
resonances with mesoscopic structures, the origin of the
diamagnetic resonance is diﬀerent from that of magnetic
resonance in SRR, which has Lorentian frequency disper-
sion, and does not show spatial dispersion. The magnetic

4

resonance in SRR has an analogy to the resonance in LC
circuit [5].

From computational and theoretical studies, it was re-
ported that magnetism takes place in the systems com-
posed of dielectric [16, 17] and metallic rods [18, 19],
comes from the Mie resonances peculiar to the rods, and
is spatially dispersive [17, 18]. There is another approach
to analyze the media of metallic rods in view of nonlocal
response [20]; strong spatial dispersion was shown even
in the very long wavelength limit. Thus, several theoret-
ical approaches have been proposed so far. In order to
test them, it is probably necessary to extract, using the
theories, eﬀective optical constants in concrete systems,
as is performed here.

We have focused on thick enough SMDM in this Com-
munication. Of course, this system is not easily fabri-
cated in reality. However, it is a good touchstone to
examine how the eﬀective optical responses emerge in pe-
riodic metal-dielectric systems. As long as the eﬀective
constants are valid for semi-inﬁnite system, the system
of ﬁnite thickness is probably described except for the
interference eﬀects associated with another surface.
In
the present analysis, there is no evidence to indicate neg-
ative refraction in SMDM, which was lately argued in
ﬁnite systems [12]. If negative refraction took place in
ﬁnitely thick SMDM, it should be due to an interference
eﬀect.

In conclusion, we have numerically extracted the full
components of eﬀective tensors of ε and µ in SMDM
by TCRM in a well-deﬁned way, and clariﬁed the eﬀec-
tive diamagnetic resonance along the optical axis. The
diamagnetism originates from the EM response in meso-
scopic structure composed of stratiﬁed metals. The ef-
fective optical responses in metamaterials directly result
from the mesoscopic structure including the surface lay-
ers. Moreover, it has been shown that the resonance is
spatially dispersive. The diamagnetic nature of thin met-
als is experimentally feasible, and it is expected to open
a new route to nonlinear optical processes using diamag-
netic resonance.

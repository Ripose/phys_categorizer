over a Flat Dielectric Substrate

We present a theory to compute the force due to light upon a particle on a dielectric plane by the
Coupled Dipole Method (CDM). We show that, with this procedure, two equivalent ways of analysis
are possible, both based on Maxwell’s stress tensor. The interest in using this method is that the
nature and size or shape of the object, can be arbitrary. Even more, the presence of a substrate can
be incorporated. To validate our theory, we present an analytical expression of the force due to the
light acting on a particle either in presence, or not, of a surface. The plane wave illuminating the
sphere can be either propagating or evanescent. Both two and three dimensional calculations are
studied.

I. INTRODUCTION

The demonstration of mechanically acting upon small
particles with radiation pressure was done by Ashkin and
coworkers1,2. A consequence of these works was the in-
vention of the optical tweezer for non destructive manip-
ulation of suspended particles3 or molecules and other
biological objects4–6. Recently, these studies have been
extended to the nanometer scale7–12, and multiple par-
ticle conﬁgurations based on optical binding have been
studied13–17. Also, the eﬀect of evanescent waves cre-
ated by total internal reﬂection on a dielectric surface
on which particles are deposited was studied in Ref. [18].
However, the only theoretical interpretation of such sys-
tem is given in Refs. [19-20].
In Ref. [19] no multiple
interaction of the light between the particles and the di-
electric surface was taken into account. On the other
hand, in Ref. [20] a multiple scattering numerical method
was put forward limited to a 2-D conﬁguration.

It is worth remarking here that several previous theo-
retical works on optical forces usually employ approxima-
tions depending on the radius of the particle; if the parti-
cle is small it has been usual to split the force into three
parts: the gradient, scattering, and absorbing forces21.
However, a rigorous and exact calculation requires the
use of Maxwell’s stress tensor. We shall use it in this
paper. Some work has been done in free space7,22, or for
a spherical particle over a dielectric surface illuminated
by a Gaussian beam.23

We shall present, therefore, a detailed theoretical anal-
ysis in three dimensions of how the optical force is built
on the multiple interaction of light with the particle and
the dielectric surface. This will be done whatever its size,
shape, or permittivity. To this end, we shall make use of
the Coupled Dipole Method (CDM), whose validity was
studied in detail in Ref. [24].

In Section II we present the CDM, and two possibili-
ties that arise with this method to compute the force by

1

means of Maxwell’s stress tensor. Concerning the ﬁrst
one, in Section II A we use directly Maxwell’s stress ten-
sor and perform the surface integrations. As regards the
second one, we present in Section II B the dipole approxi-
mation on each subunit of discretization for the numerical
calculations. Since however these methods are somewhat
cumbersome from a numerical point of view, we have in-
troduced in Section III an analytical calculation for the
force due to the light on a small particle in the presence
of the surface. Results are illustrated in three dimensions
in Section III A (a little sphere) and in two dimensions in
Section III B (a small cylinder). In Section IV we com-
pute the force with the CDM, and we validate these cal-
culations on electrically small particles by means of the
analytical solution presented in Section III. After this
validation of the CDM on little particles, we present in
Section IV C calculations on larger particles.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE COMPUTED
WITH THE COUPLED DIPOLE METHOD

The Coupled Dipole Method (CDM) was introduced
by Purcell and Pennypacker in 1973 for studying the
scattering of light by non-spherical dielectric grains in
free space.25 This system is represented by a cubic array
of N polarizable subunits. The electric ﬁeld E(ri, ω) at
each subunit position ri can be expressed as:

N

Xj=1

E(ri, ω) = E0(ri, ω) +

[S(ri, rj, ω)

(1)

+ T(ri, rj, ω)]αj(ω)E(rj, ω).

where E0(ri, ω) is the ﬁeld at the position ri in the ab-
sence of the scattering object, T is the ﬁeld susceptibility
associated to the free space26 (with T(ri, ri, ω) = 0 to
avoid the diagonal case), and S represents the ﬁeld sus-
ceptibility associated with the surface in front of which
the particle is placed (see Fig. 1). The derivation of the

ﬁeld susceptibility of the surface is extensively developed
in Refs. [ 27, 28]. αj(ω), the polarizability of the subunit
j, is expressed as:

αj(ω) = α0

cording to Eq. (2) as deﬁned by Draine29. The term

j (ω) is the radiative reaction term, necessary
for the optical theorem to be satisﬁed and for a correct
calculation of forces via the CDM.30

FIG. 1. Geometry of the conﬁguration considered in this
paper: sphere, or cylinder, of radius a on a dielectric ﬂat sur-
face. The relative permittivity is ε = 2.25 both for the sphere
(or the cylinder) and the surface. The wavelength used is
λ = 632.8nm in vacuum and the incident wave vector k is in
the XZ plane.

Once the values of E(ri, ω) are obtained by solving the
3N ), it is easy

linear system, Eq. (1), (whose size is 3N

where S is a surface enclosing the object, n is the local
outward unit normal,

and
e represents the real part of a complex number. Let
us notice that Eq. (5) is written in CGS units for an ob-
ject in vacuum, and so will be given all forces presented
in Section IV. To apply Eq. (5) with the CDM, we must
ﬁrst solve Eq. (1) to obtain E(ri, ω) at each dipole po-
sition, and then, through Eq. (4) and Faraday equation,
the electromagnetic ﬁeld is computed at any position r
of S. This enables us to numerically perform the two
dimensional quadrature involved in Eq. (5).

B. Force determined via the dipolar approximation

Let us consider a small spherical particle with a radius
smaller than the wavelength. Then the u-component of
the force can be written in the dipole approximation:33,30

Fu(r0) = (1/2)

ℜ

Xv=1 (cid:18)

(u=1, 2, 3)

where r0 is the position of the center of the sphere and
u and v stand for the components along either x, y or
z. We discretize the object into N small dipoles pi(r, ω)
(i=1,...,N ) so that it is possible to compute the force on
each dipole from Eq. (6). Hence, to obtain the total force
on the particle it suﬃces to sum the contributions F(ri)
from of all the dipoles. To use this method it is necessary

∂Ev(ri, ω)
∂u

to know

at each discretization subunit. On

performing the derivative of Eq. (1) we obtain:

∂E(r, ω)

∂r (cid:19)r=ri

(cid:19)r=ri

(7)

[S(r, rj, ω) + T(r, rj, ω)]

αj(ω)E(rj, ω).

(cid:19)r=ri

Thus, the derivative of the ﬁeld at ri, requires that
of E0(ri, ω) and that of the ﬁeld susceptibility both in
free space and in the presence of the surface for all pairs
(ri, rj). Hence we now have two tensors with 27 compo-
nents each. It is important to notice that the derivative
of the ﬁeld at ri has been directly computed from just the

(cid:18)

N

+

Xj=1 (cid:18)

∂
∂r

ﬁeld at this position ri, so it is not computed in a self-
consistent manner. To have the required self-consistence
for the derivative, it is necessary to perform in Eq. (1)
a multipole expansion up to second order. Then, this
equation must be written up to the quadrupole order af-
ter taking its derivative. As a result, we obtain a linear
system, whose unknowns are both the electric ﬁeld and
its derivative. The disadvantage of this method is that
the size of the linear system increases up to 12N
12N
and requires the computation of the second derivative of
the ﬁeld susceptibility (81 components). More informa-
tion about the CDM by using the multipole expansion
can be found in Ref. [24].

×

In what follows, we shall denote CDM-A the force com-
puted directly from Maxwell’s stress tensor Eq. (5) and
CDM-B the force obtained on using the ﬁeld derivative
Eq. (6). The advantages of these two methods is that
they are not restricted to a particular shape of the ob-
ject to be discretized. Furthermore, this object can be
inhomogeneous, metallic, or in a complex system when-
ever it is possible to compute its ﬁeld susceptibility.

III. FORCE ON A DIPOLAR PARTICLE

A. The three dimensional case: a sphere

Eq. (1) with N = 1, taking the surface into account,
gives for the ﬁeld at the position r0 = (x0, y0, z0) of the
sphere of a radius a:

E(r0, ω) = [I

α(ω)S(r0, r0, ω)]

E0(r0, ω),

(8)

−1

−

−

where I is the unit tensor, and α(ω) the polarizabil-
ity of the sphere according to Eq. (2) with α0(ω) =
a3(ε(ω)
1)/(ε(ω) + 2). We notice that S is purely di-
agonal and depends only on the distance z0 between the
center of the sphere and the surface (see Fig. 1). We also
assume that the sphere is near the surface and, hence, the
ﬁeld susceptibility of the surface can be used in the static
approximation (k0 = 0, we shall discuss the validity of
this approximation in Section IV). Therefore, the com-
ponents of this tensor become Sxx = Syy =
0),
and Szz =
ǫ)/(1 + ǫ) repre-
0), with ∆ = (1
senting the Fresnel coeﬃcient of the surface. Since we
consider the object in the presence of a surface with a
real relative permittivity, ∆ is real. As shown by Fig. 1,
the light incident wave vector k0lies in the XZ plane.
Therefore, there is no force in the Y -direction. On us-
ing Eqs. (6) and (8), and assuming the incident ﬁeld E0
above the surface to be a plane wave either propagating
or evanescent, depending on the illumination angle θ, the
components of the force on the sphere can be written as:

for s-polarization. We see that the advantage of working
with the static approximation is that an analytic form of
the force is obtained. To see the eﬀect of the incident
ﬁeld only (i.e., without interaction with the surface), we
can put z0
or ∆ = 0 in Eqs. (9)-(12). The forces
are then expressed as:

If we look at Fig. 1, we see that the incident ﬁeld above
the surface always has kx real, but kz can be either real
(propagating wave) or imaginary (evanescent wave when
θ > θc where θc is the critical angle deﬁned as √ǫ sin θc =
1). Hence, all forces in the X-direction have the form
e(α(ikx)∗) where A is always a positive number. In

using Eq. (2) we ﬁnd that
(we have assumed that (4/9)k6
1, in fact this ex-
10−7 for a = 10nm, λ = 632.8nm,
pression is about 6.6
and ε = 2.25, thus this approximation is perfectly valid).
Hence, whatever the ﬁeld, either propagating or evanes-
cent, and the system either in presence of a surface or in
free space, the force in the X-direction is always along
the incident ﬁeld.

From Eq. (14) and from the discussion above, it is easy
to see that in the absence of interface the force is pos-
itive for a propagating incident wave (kz real).
In the
case of an evanescent incident wave, kz = iγ with γ > 0,
2/2; namely
and hence the force becomes Fz =
|
the sphere is attracted towards the higher intensity ﬁeld.
Concerning the force along the Z-direction, its sign will
depend on the nature of the ﬁeld and the interaction of
the sphere with the surface. We shall discuss this in Sec-
tion IV A.

B. The two dimensional case: a cylinder

For a cylinder with its axis at (x0, z0), parallel to the
Y -axis (Fig. 1), the electric ﬁeld at its center is obtained
by an equation similar to Eq. (8), but with a diﬀerent

polarizability. With the help of Refs. [34] and [35] we
write this polarizability:

The subscripts i = 1, and 2 correspond to the ﬁeld ei-

der, respectively. The ﬁeld susceptibility of the sur-
face in the two dimensional case is given in Ref. [36]
for s-polarization and in Ref.
[37] for p-polarization.
Since we address a cylinder with a small radius a and
near the surface, we use the static approximation, then
∆/(2z2
0) and Syy = 0. In the same way as
Sxx = Szz =
seen before, the force is written as:

−

as those established for the sphere with only a replace-
ment of α by α1 or α2, depending on the polarization.
Concerning the force along the X-direction, we have the
same eﬀect as for the sphere, namely Fx has the sign of
kx.

which corresponds to a power of 1.19mW distributed on
a surface of 10µm2, the force on the sphere in MKSA

units is 2.7991
both CDM-A and B the convergence is reached even for
a coarse discretization, and, hence, either one of the two
CDM approaches can be used. As regards the dipolar
approximation, we conclude that it is perfectly valid to
use it for a sphere of radius a =10nm (a/λ < 0.016).

Now that we have validated our methods (both ana-
lytic and CDM) we proceed to take the surface into ac-
count. It should be remarked that with the CMD-A it
is not possible to compute the force when the sphere is
on the surface. This is because for an observation point
very close to the sphere, the electromagnetic ﬁeld values
are aﬀected by the discretization of the sphere, and so
the ﬁeld is not correctly computed. An empirical crite-
rion that we have found24 is that the electric ﬁeld must
be computed at least at a distance d from the sphere
but this criterion depends on the relative permittivity.
For more precision about the dependence of the criterion
and the relative permittivity one can look to Ref. [29].
With the CDM-B this problem does not occur because
with this approach it is not necessary to obtain the ﬁeld
outside the sphere.

a sphere of radius a = 10nm, at an angle of incidence
θ = 42◦, without any approximation with the CDM-A
(namely, taking into account all retardation eﬀects) with
the SAFSS, and with the approximation in which no in-
teraction between the sphere and the surface is consid-
ered. The diﬀerence between SAFSS and the exact cal-
culation is less than 1.5%. This is in fact logical. Near
the surface, the SAFSS is correct, far from the surface,
however, the ﬁeld susceptibility associated with the sur-
face in the exact calculation is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
the ﬁeld susceptibility derived from a static approxima-
tion. Nevertheless, for distances larger than z = 30nm
the curves overlap because the sphere does not feel the
substrate at this distance. This is manifested by a diﬀer-
ence of only 2% between the exact calculation result and
that computed without addressing the surface (horizon-
tal line).

In all ﬁgures shown next, we plot the force versus the
distance z between the sphere (or the cylinder, see Sec-
tion IV B) and the plane, (notice that we represent by z0
the distance between the center of the sphere, or cylin-
der, and the plane). The calculation using the dipole
approximation, as well as the CDM(A-B), has been done
with the static approximation for the ﬁeld susceptibility
of the surface (SAFSS). However, the distance between
the sphere and the surface goes generally up to 100nm.
In order to justify the study of the force at distances
about 100nm between the sphere and the plane through
a calculation done in the static approximation, we plot

FIG. 3. Normalized force in the Z-direction on a sphere of
radius a = 10nm. The full line corresponds to the dipole ap-
proximation, the dashed line to the CDM-A, and the dotted
◦
line to the CDM-B. The angle of incidence is θ = 0
. The
inset shows the force near z = 50nm. We show the zero force
and the force computed from Mie’s limit with Eq. (21).

Fig. 3 shows the normalized force for light at an an-
gle of incidence θ = 0◦. The curves corresponding to
CDM-A and B are similar, and the dipole approximation
appears slightly above when the sphere is close to the
surface. This may seem strange at ﬁrst sight in view of
the good results presented in Table I (we will discuss it
later). We can see that although the illuminating wave
is propagating, if the sphere is near the surface, it is
attracted towards it, opposite to the propagation direc-
tion. To understand this, we look at Eq. (12), established
with the dipole approximation with the values kx = 0,
kz = k0, E0z = 0 which corresponds to θ = 0◦. Af-

ter some approximations (namely (4/9)k6

The factor before the bracket of Eq. (22) corresponds to
the intensity of the ﬁeld at the position of the sphere.
The ﬁrst term in the bracket of this equation is due to
the light scattering on the particle (as in free space) and
is always positive. The second term in the bracket is al-
ways negative as ∆ < 0. Therefore, the relative weight
of the two terms in Eq. (22) determines the direction of
Fz. Fz given by Eq. (22), becomes zero for:

(23)

Hence, in our example we ﬁnd z0 = 57nm. Below the
value of Eq. (23) the force is attractive towards the sur-
face, and above this value the sphere is pushed away.
This is seen in the inset of Fig. 3 which enlarges those
details. We ﬁnd Fz = 0 at z = 47nm namely at
z0 =(47+10)nm=57nm, which is exactly the same value
previously found. Physically, the attraction of the sphere
is due to the second term of Eq. (22) which corresponds
to the interaction of the dipole with its own evanescent
ﬁeld reﬂected by the surface. Now we can explain the
discrepancy between the dipole approximation and the
CDM as regards the good results obtained in free space.
In fact, when the computation is done in free space the
ﬁeld can be considered uniform over a range of 20nm.
However, in an evanescent ﬁeld, the applied ﬁeld is not
uniform inside the sphere and the Clausius Mossotti re-
lation is less adequate, hence, the dipole approximation
departs more from the exact calculation. However, when
the sphere is out from the near ﬁeld zone, the three meth-
ods match together (see the inset of Fig. 3). We can also
see in the inset of Fig. 3, that these three curves tend
towards the Mie limit because at large distance there is
no interaction with the surface.

FIG. 4. Normalized force in the Z-direction acting on the

sphere with a =10nm. The angle of incidence θ = 42
is
larger than the critical angle θc = 41.8◦. The full line cor-
responds to the dipole approximation, the dashed line to the
CDM-A, and the dotted line to the CDM-B. Curves without
symbols are for p-polarization, and those with symbol + are
for s-polarization.

Fig. 4 shows the z-component of the normalized force
when the incident wave illuminated at θ = 42◦ > 41.8◦ =

It is easy to see that for a dielectric sphere both the ﬁrst
and second terms within the brackets of Eq. (24) are
always negative. Hence, the sphere is always attracted
towards the surface (the same reasoning can be done for
p-polarization). Near the surface the force becomes larger
because of the interaction of the sphere with its own
evanescent ﬁeld. We notice that the normalized force
becomes constant at larger z. This constant reﬂects the
fact that the force decreases as e−2γz from the surface.

B. Results for a small cylinder

Let us now address an inﬁnite cylinder. Since the CDM
method used here works in three dimensions, we have
computed the force on a ﬁnite length cylinder. In order
to verify this approximation, we once again compare the
force, obtained in free space from the CDM with diﬀerent
cylinders lengths, with that from a calculation done with
the dipole approximation established in Section III B,
and that from an exact calculation for an inﬁnite cylin-
der38 (i.e. the well known 2-D version for cylinders of
the Mie calculation for spheres, hence referred to in the
table as “Mie”) . We consider a radius of the cylinder,
a = 10nm, with the same spacing lattice as for the case of
the sphere, namely 81 subunits. We have seen that this
value of d = 4nm gives consistent results. In all cases we
compute the force per unit length of the cylinder.

The ﬁrst case addressed is with the electric ﬁeld per-
pendicular to the axis of the cylinder (p-polarization).
The results are given in Table II. The second case con-
sidered (s polarization) in Table III.

We notice that the dipole approximation gives cor-
rect results for p-polarization, but it is worse for s-
polarization.
If we compare the CDM-A and CDM-B,
we see that they both give the same results. But we
also see that the length of the cylinder has a great in-
ﬂuence on them, although up to a diﬀerent extent ac-
cording to whether we deal with p or s-polarization. For
p-polarization, the simulation of an inﬁnite cylinder be-
comes correct at L
λ/2 and for s-polarization only it
is so at L
2λ. This can be understood by the fact
that in p-polarization the electric ﬁeld is continuous at

≃

≃

the end of the cylinder, thus, the end has not a large in-
ﬂuence on the ﬁeld computed around the cylinder. How-
ever, in s-polarization the ﬁeld is discontinuous at the
end of the cylinder and then the ﬁeld will strongly vary
around this end and so will do the force. This is why in
s-polarization it is necessary to consider cylinders with

large lengths in order to avoid edge eﬀects. Now let us
address the presence of the plane surface to compute the
force. We consider the cylinder length L = 1551nm. Like
for the sphere, we address both θ = 0◦, (Fig. 5), and 42◦,
(Fig. 6). The curves from CDM-B stop at z =10nm due
to the disadvantage previously remarked.

Eq. (25) is of the same form as Eq. (22). Hence, the same
consequence is derived: near the surface the cylinder is
attracted towards the plane surface. But far from the
plane the cylinder is pushed away because at this dis-
tance the cylinder cannot interact with itself. Like for
the sphere, we can compute the distance z0 at which the
force is null:

the sphere. However, in s-polarization there is a diﬀer-
ence. Then the force obtained from the dipolar approxi-
mation is always constant because there is no interaction
with the surface. This is clear from Eq. (19), and it is due
to the fact that in the electrostatic limit the ﬁeld suscep-
tibility Syy tends to zero, and then there is no inﬂuence of
the surface on the cylinder. This is a consequence of the
continuity of both the ﬁeld and its derivative of both the
plane and the cylinder.36 Therefore, the cylinder does
not feel the presence of the plane, and as the wave is
propagating, the force is positive thus pushing the cylin-
der away from the plane with magnitude values given by
table III. Notice that the force obtained from CDM-B,
when the sphere is in contact with the surface, becomes
negative in s-polarization. This is due to the diﬀraction
of the ﬁeld at the end of the cylinder, which induces a
component perpendicular to the plane, and therefore an
attractive force.

p polarization

s polarization

observe a force always attractive (Fz < 0) whatever the
polarization. For p-polarization we have exactly the same
behaviour as for the sphere. However, for s-polarization
the normalized force is always constant whatever the dis-
tance between the cylinder and the surface, due to the
same reason as before, namely, Syy = 0. Only when the
cylinder is on the surface, we can see from the CDM-B
calculation that the force is slightly more attractive for
the same reason previously quoted.

C. Results for a sphere beyond the Rayleigh regime

Let us now consider a sphere of radius a =100nm. This
size is far from the Rayleigh scattering regime (
λ/3).
As in previous cases, we ﬁrst validate our method with
the aid of Mie’s calculation in free space. The following
table shows the results:

≈

As before, as d decreases, the CDM results tend to the
Mie’s calculation. The error never exceeding 1.7%. Now,
we address the presence of a ﬂat dielectric surface. The
forces, to be shown next, are computed with CDM-B only
since the particle can be in contact with the surface.

In Fig. 7 we present the case θ = 0◦. We have plotted
two curves: the exact calculation and the SAFSS done
with N = 1791. In the inset of Fig. 7, we see that even
near the surface the SAFSS is not good. This is due
to the large radius of the sphere, then the discretization
subunits on the top of the sphere are at 100nm from the
surface, and thus the eﬀects of retardation are now im-
portant. The SAFSS calculation also shows that at a
distance of 200nm (which corresponds to the size of the
sphere: 2a=200nm) the sphere does not feel the surface,
as manifested by the fact than then the curve obtained
from this computation reaches the Mie scattering limit
previously obtained in Table IV (cf.
the full horizon-
tal line in the inset). Hence, we conclude that evanes-
cent waves are absent from the interaction process at
distances beyond this limit. From the exact calculation
we obtain a very low force near the surface, due to the
interaction of the sphere with itself. This eﬀect vanishes
beyond z
50nm where oscillations of the force Fz take
place with period λ/2. As these oscillations do not occur
in the SAFSS, this means that they are due to interfer-
ences from multiple reﬂections between the surface and
the sphere. As expected, they decrease as the sphere goes
far from the surface.

FIG. 8. Normalized force in the Z-direction on a sphere
with radius a =100nm, λ =632.8nm, and ε = 2.25. The light
angle of incidence is θ = 42◦ > θc. The full line corresponds
to the exact calculation with CDM-B, and the dashed line to
the static approximation. the curves without symbol are in
p-polarization, and those with the + symbol in s-polarization.

Fig. 8 shows the force computed with an angle of inci-
dence θ = 42◦. We plot the exact calculation (full line)
and the SAFSS (dashed line) both for p-polarization (no
symbol) and s-polarization (+ symbol). Once again, we
see that the SAFSS is not adequate even near the sur-
face. On the other hand, in the exact calculation, the
two polarizations show oscillations of the force Fz with
period λ/2. However, there is a large diﬀerence of mag-
nitude of these oscillations between the two polarizations
(see inset of Fig. 8). To understand this diﬀerence, we
must recall that the sphere is a set of dipoles. When a
dipole is along the Z-direction there is no propagating
wave in this direction. But if the dipole is oriented in

9

the X(or Y )-direction, its radiation is maximum in the
Z-direction. However, in s-polarization all dipoles are,
approximately, parallel to the surface, so there is an im-
portant radiation from the dipole in the Z-direction, and,
consequently, between the sphere and the surface.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented exact three dimen-
sional calculations based on the Coupled Dipole Method
and an analytical expression for the force on either a
sphere or an inﬁnite cylinder, both in front of a ﬂat di-
electric surface. The results for small bodies show that,
whatever the polarization, in the case of a sphere, and
in p-polarization for the cylinder, the force always has
the same behaviour: namely, in the case of illumination
under total internal reﬂection, the particle is always at-
tracted towards the surface. A surprising result in the
case when the illuminating beam is perpendicular to the
surface and the object remains sticked to the surface, is
that then the force is attractive due the interaction of the
particle with itself, and therefore this object keeps sticked
to the surface. However, when the object is far from the
surface, the force becomes repulsive, as one would have
expected.

For s-polarization, the cylinder does not “feel” the
presence of the substrate. This is more noticeable for
a propagating wave, namely, at angles of incidence lower
than the critical angle. However, when an evanescent
wave is created by total internal reﬂection, the force is
attractive under s-polarization.

The scope of the static calculation for this conﬁgura-
tion has been validated. We have also shown the ad-
vantage of having an analytical form which shows the
contribution of the incident ﬁeld on the particle, as well
as that of the force induced by the sphere (or cylinder) on
itself, thus yielding a better understanding of the physical
process involved.

For bigger spheres, we have observed somewhat dif-
ferent eﬀects of the forces. Under the action of evanes-
cent waves, the force is always attractive, but it always
becomes repulsive when it is due to propagating waves.
Unlike the case of small sphere, there is no point of zero
force.

Multi-frame blind deconvolution with linear equality constraints

Institute for Solar Physics of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

Mats G. L¨ofdahl

ABSTRACT

The Phase Diverse Speckle (PDS) problem is formulated mathematically as Multi Frame Blind Deconvolution (MFBD)
together with a set of Linear Equality Constraints (LECs) on the wavefront expansion parameters. This MFBD–LEC
formulation is quite general and, in addition to PDS, it allows the same code to handle a variety of diﬀerent data collection
schemes speciﬁed as data, the LECs, rather than in the code. It also relieves us from having to derive new expressions
for the gradient of the wavefront parameter vector for each type of data set. The idea is ﬁrst presented with a simple
formulation that accommodates Phase Diversity, Phase Diverse Speckle, and Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensing. Then
various generalizations are discussed, that allows many other types of data sets to be handled.

Background: Unless auxiliary information is used, the Blind Deconvolution problem for a single frame is not well
posed because the object and PSF information in a data frame cannot be separated. There are diﬀerent ways of bringing
auxiliary information to bear on the problem. MFBD uses several frames which helps somewhat, because the solutions
are constrained by a requirement that the object be the same, but is often not enough to get useful results without further
constraints. One class of MFBD methods constrain the solutions by requiring that the PSFs correspond to wavefronts
over a certain pupil geometry, expanded in a ﬁnite basis. This is an eﬀective approach but there is still a problem of
uniqueness in that diﬀerent phases can give the same PSF. Phase Diversity and the more general PDS methods are special
cases of this class of MFBD, where the observations are usually arranged so that in-focus data is collected together with
intentionally defocused data, where information on the object is sacriﬁced for more information on the aberrations. The
known diﬀerences and similarities between the phases are used to get better estimates.

Keywords: Wavefront sensing, Deconvolution, Phase diversity, Inverse problems, Image restoration, Shack-Hartmann.

1. INTRODUCTION

We ﬁrst present a technique for jointly estimating the common object and the aberrations in a series of images that diﬀer
only in the aberrations. With no extra information beyond the image formation model, including aberrations from the
phase in the generalized pupil transmission function, it is a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution
(MFBD)1 method. Constraining the PSFs to be physical by requiring that they come from an underlying parameterization
of the phase over the pupil is a powerful technique. Although such methods do work,2, 3 methods using more information
work better.4 Data sets used in Phase-Diverse Speckle (PDS) interferometry5–7 has such extra information in the form
of two (or more) imaging channels with a known diﬀerence in phase (at least to type), with Phase Diversity (PD)6, 8, 9
as the special case of only one such pair (or set). These are all diﬀerent data collection schemes lending themselves
to similar joint inversion techniques. The purpose of the formulation presented here is to recognize the similarities and
outlining a method for treating them all with a single algorithm. We discuss how the formulation accommodates also
Shack–Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensing (WFS) as well as, with a couple of simple generalizations, several other types
of data sets.

We start with the ML metric for a MFBD data set and derive an algorithm for the joint estimation of object(s) and
aberrations for a variety of imaging scenarios. In its simplest form, it is equivalent to MFBD, while the known relations
between image channels for particular data collection schemes are expressed as Linear Equality Constraints (LECs).

Throughout this paper a Gaussian noise model for the data is assumed because that permits simpliﬁcations in the ML
solution methods. It is our experience with Gaussian noise PD, that it is a good model for low-contrast objects like the

solar photosphere6 but also that artiﬁcial high-contrast objects (like a laser–pinhole source) can often be imaged in such a
way that the noise is negligible.10

A code based on the formulation presented here has been successfully applied to PD, PDS, and MFBD data of various

kind, both from the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope as well as several diﬀerent simulated data sets.

2. MULTI-FRAME BLIND DECONVOLUTION

The Gaussian white noise assumption allows us to use the inverse Wiener ﬁlter estimate of the object,

When minimizing L, the γobj term in Q has the eﬀect of establishing stability with respect to perturbations in the object.
Its use in Eq. (4) suggests setting γobj to something proportional to the inverse of the signal to noise ratios of the image
data frames. The other regularization parameter, γwf, stabilizes the wavefront estimates and can be set by examining the
relation between L and the RMS of the wavefront.12 For simplicity, this term is given under the assumption that the
ψm are Karhunen–Lo`eve (KL)13 functions, where λm is the expected variance of mode m. This should work reasonably
well also for low-order Zernike polynomials. In the general case, the wavefront regularization term is a matrix operation
involving the covariances.11

Note that, although presented in a PD setting, this metric has nothing to do with PD per se, it is just a MFBD metric.

The PD part enters in the parameterization in earlier PD methods and, equivalently, in the LECs in this presentation.

2.2. Gradient and Hessian for Traditional Phase Diversity

Eﬃcient minimization of L requires the gradients and, for some methods, the Hessian with respect to the aberration
parameters. We start by considering the traditional PD problem, for which the normal equations can be written as

where the elements of α are the coeﬃcients of an expansion of the single phase that is at the pupil of all diversity channels.

2.3. Gradient and Hessian for MFBD

The diﬀerence between MFBD and PD is that we in general do not know any relation between the wavefronts in the diﬀer-
ent channels. The PD gradient and Hessian expressions can then be simpliﬁed considerably by relaxing all dependencies
between imaging channels, because we can then set all multiplications involving pupil quantities with diﬀerent j to zero.
This corresponds to J diﬀerent pupils with independent phases.

We also have to multiply with a factor √J for each diﬀerentiating operation. This is because we are splitting each
independent variable αm into J diﬀerent α jm. The vector sum of J instances of identical dα jm is √J times larger than
dαm. Because this factor appears in the denominator of the derivatives, we have to correct the gradient and the Hessian by
multiplying with √J and J, respectively.

We lexicographically arrange all the α jm in a single column vector, α, with N = JM elements, so that we can also

refer to them as αn, with a single index n = ( j

3. LINEAR EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

3.1. Notation and Theory

Now we add information about the data set in the form of LECs. The theory for solving optimization problems with LECs
can be found in some text books on numerical methods, e.g. Ref. 14. The idea is that each constraint reduces the number
of unknowns by one. We can transform a constrained optimization problem with N parameters and NC constraints into an
unconstrained problem with N

NC unknowns.

The constraints are given as a set of linear equations that have to be satisﬁed exactly,

Eq. (17) is under-determined and can therefore be solved exactly by several diﬀerent α. All solutions to Eq. (17) can be
written as

α = α + Q2 ·
where α is a particular solution to Eq. (17) and the N′ = N
NC column vectors of Q2 are an orthogonal basis of the null

space of C. A particular solution can always be found by setting the N′ last elements of α to zero and solving the reduced
system

NC submatrix of C and α′ is a vector containing the ﬁrst NC elements of α. Note, though,
where C′ is the upper left NC ×
that all known diﬀerences can be incorporated into θ j, so we can set d
0 without loss of generality, and we always have
the particular solution α = 0. We can ﬁnd a basis for the null space by using an orthogonal decomposition of C, such as
SVD or QR. With QR factorization, we write

where Q2 is the rightmost N′ columns of Q and T used as a superscript denotes matrix transpose.

The constrained minimization problem in α can be transformed into an unconstrained minimization problem in a
reduced set of variables, β, an N′ element vector of parameters, βn′ . The normal equations for the transformed problem
are obtained by left-multiplying Eq. (12) with QT

Once we have a solution for β, we easily get the solution for α from Eq. (18).

In order to eﬃciently express the LECs, we need to be able to distinguish between frames collected in diﬀerent ways.

where we momentarily disregard the registration of the imaging channels. The rows can be in any order but it seems

Q2 is easily interpreted by looking at Eq. (18). The K individual α j are identical copies of β/ √K. Identical α j are

3.3. Phase Diversity with Partly Unknown Diﬀerences in Phase
For modes with unknown diﬀerences between the channels, we simply do not add any constraint, thus allowing the
algorithm to optimize the corresponding coeﬃcients independently in the two channels based on the available data. This
can be used e.g. for the focus mode, if the diversity it is not known well, or for other low order modes that may diﬀer
between diversity channels.

The most common unknown diﬀerences, however, are for the tilt modes, corresponding to image registration. Unless
we have information from other data sets, we generally don’t know the tilt diﬀerences. So we want to exclude the tilt
modes from Eq. (22). However, we may wish to prevent a common tilt to grow without bounds by requiring that they add
up to zero,

In practice, we must allow for unknown registration between PD channels as well as between consecutive PD sets.
Normally we know that the diﬀerence in tilt between the PD channels, k, is constant over time, t. Finally, we require that
the registration parameters sum up to zero independently in the two directions.

Note that this problem is just as constrained as the problem with completely known phase diﬀerences, thus the null space
matrices have the same dimensions. See sample matrices in Fig. 4. The special tilt constraints result in a less orderly and
sparse null space matrix, although not as bad as in the PD case.

When working with seeing degraded data, it is likely that all PD sets are not of the same quality. One strength with
PDS is that bad data can be helped by being processed jointly with the worse data. However, intuition suggests that there
are cases where the bad data disturbs the inversion of the good data. It can then be useful to calculate individual metrics
for each PD set, use Eq. (6) but skip the γwf term and limit the sum over j to one t.

3.5. Shack–Hartmann WFS

A Shack–Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensor consists of a microlens array that form a number of sub-images, each sampling
diﬀerent parts of the pupil. SH wavefront sensing works with point sources as well as with extended objects. An example
of the latter is that it has been used with solar telescopes.15, 16 A fundamental limitation for such applications is that the
number of microlenses is restricted by the requirement that each sub-image must resolve solar ﬁne structure.

6

Usually, the mean gradient of the phase is estimated by measuring the relative or absolute image motion in the subim-
ages. These local tilts are then combined into a phase over the whole pupil. This means that in conventional analysis
of SH wavefront data, information about wavefront curvature over the microlenses, manifested as diﬀerential blurring in
the subimages, is discarded. It is only by more detailed modeling that all relevant information on the wavefronts can be
extracted, which in principle should be made down to the noise level of the data.

With diﬀerent A j for diﬀerent imaging channels, j, Eqs. (1)–(3) accommodate SH data. The phase over the full pupil
is constrained to be the same for all channels, while the diﬀerent A j correspond to the diﬀerent parts of the pupil that are
sampled by the diﬀerent microlenses. The constraints matrix is the same as for PD with J channels.

Calibration of the relative positions of the SH sub-images is required for conventional processing. If such data are
available, they can be entered as tilts in the diﬀerent θ j. However, it should be possible to estimate these tilts from the data
if θ j is set to zero and local tilts are included in the parameterization of the wavefront. On the other hand, no global tilts
are necessary.

It has been demonstrated in simulation with two microlenses that this image formation model allows higher modes
to be estimated than with conventional local tilt approximations, because local aberrations within each subimage is taken
into account.17 SH data have also been considered for regular PD analysis. The microlens array acts as a single phase
screen and the sub-images are regarded as a single phase diverse image, to be processed together with a conventional high-
resolution image.18, 19 Both approaches are sensitive to getting the geometry of the microlens array right (phase screen in
the latter case, positions of the A j in the MFBD–LEC case). However, in the MFBD–LEC approach, the registration of
the subimages does not have to be known; it can be estimated.

You can still use a conventional image as another image channel in the MFBD–LEC formulation. If local tilt calibra-
tion data is available, this should be straight-forward. One would want to avoid estimating local microlens tilts for the
high-resolution channel. This can easily be done by adding LECs that set them to zero. See also Sect. 4.1.

4. EXTENDING THE PRESENTED FORMULATION

The formulation presented so far was chosen so that it would be fairly straight-forward, while still accommodating PDS
and SH WFS. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the LEC approach, we now discuss brieﬂy a number of relaxations
of some of the requirements, and the types of data sets that can then be treated.

4.1. Diﬀerent Phase Parameterization
It is trivial to relax the requirements that M is the same for every data set. The single index of the α and b arrays can then
be written as n = m +

j
−

1

j′=1 M j′ rather than n = JM.

One application for this is the SH processing of Sect. 3.5. If the SH sub-images are to be processed together with a
conventional high-resolution image, one may want to exclude the local sub-pupil tilts from the parameterization of the
phase seen by the conventional camera. See also the following subsections.

P

4.2. Diﬀerent Objects
We can also relax the requirement that all images have the same object. This requires involving another index, say
(for “scene” or “set”), and changing the formulae for the metric and its derivatives to allow for separate
s
objects Fs. The metric can then be written as L =
s Ls, where Ls is from Eq. (6) but summing over j only that involves
object Fs.

1, . . . , S

∈ {

}

P

One application for this is high-resolution solar magnetograms, see Ref. 20, 21. Magnetograms can be made by
calculating the diﬀerence between opposite polarization components of light in a Zeeman sensitive spectral line collected
through a birefringent ﬁlter. Because the magnetic signal is essentially the diﬀerence between two very similar images, it is
important to minimize artifacts from a number of error sources, among them registration, seeing, in particular diﬀerential
seeing, and instrumental eﬀects.

The diﬀerential seeing problem can be handled by making each image the sum of many short exposures, where bad
frames are discarded and the images can be well registered before adding. The short exposures can be made simulta-
neously in the two polarization channels by using a polarizing beamsplitter. To reduce also the inﬂuence of diﬀerent

aberrations in the paths after the beamsplitter, the polarization states can be rapidly switched between the detectors, so
that each polarization state is recorded with a aberrations from both paths.

In order to reduce the eﬀects of seeing degradation of the image resolution, the two sequences of short exposures could
also be MFBD restored for seeing eﬀects. Better would be to do this using constraints that come from the fact that the
aberration diﬀerences between the two channels is constant, with proper respect paid to the switching. Since registration
parameters are estimated along with the phase curvature terms, this could solve the seeing problem while at the same
time registering the image channels to subpixel accuracy. This should be better than registration with cross-correlation
techniques, since non-symmetric instantaneous PSFs would tend to corrupt such alignment.

The fact that the diﬀerences between the two polarization signals are so subtle might inspire another approach. If the
object is considered to be the same for wavefront sensing purposes, then we can treat the data as a PDS data set with zero
diversity terms θ j. The object is the same and so are the phases, except for the registration terms.

4.3. Diﬀerent wavelengths
If PDS data of the same object is collected in several diﬀerent wavelengths, and the cameras are synchronized, it has been
shown that wavefronts estimated from one PDS set can be used for restoration of the object seen in the data collected
in the other wavelengths.22 However, this requires information about the wavefront diﬀerences as seen by the diﬀerent
cameras. The diﬀerences that come from the diﬀerent wavelengths can easily be calculated and other diﬀerences can be
estimated from a selected subset of a larger data set and then applied to all the data under the assumption that they do not
change.

This assumption could also be used to advantage in a joint treatment of the simultaneous PDS (SPDS) sets. The

diﬀerent-object generalization from Sect. 4.2 is used together with PDS LECs and LECs that express this assumption,

CSPDS :

where λs is the wavelength (in arbitrary units) used for set s. For the assumption of wavelength independent aberrations
to hold, the optical system should be approximately achromatic. In practice, this means the diﬀerences between the
wavelengths should not be too large.

Again, this can also be relevant for SH, if a high-resolution image is processed together with the SH data – and the

wavelength is not the same in the SH sensor as in the imaging camera.

4.4. Diﬀerent Numbers of Diversity Channels
Finally, we can also treat data sets with diﬀerent numbers of phase diversity channels in diﬀerent wavelengths. This
requires a K that varies with s, J =
s Ks. This is perhaps most useful because it permits setting Ks = 1 for some s. This
corresponds to PDS data set in one wavelength and simultaneous MFBD data in another wavelength as in Refs. 23, 24.

P

We should be able to run several such sets jointly and constrain the aberration diﬀerences between diﬀerent s to be the

same for all t, without requiring the object to be the same.

Again, the advantage of the joint treatment is of course that wavefront diﬀerences between diﬀerent imaging cameras

do not have to be calibrated but are estimated together with the aberrations that are in common to the diﬀerent cameras.

5. DISCUSSION

We have presented a formulation of the MFBD problem that accomodates the varying data collection schemes involved in
PD and PDS as well as SH WFS and a number of combinations of data in diﬀerent wavelengths or polarizations and with
or without diversity in the phase or pupil geometry. In doing this, we have not exhausted the types of data sets that can be
treated with the method presented in this paper. As long as there are known relations between the imaging channels, that
can be formulated in terms of constraints on the wavefront coeﬃcients, the data could be handled and the constraints can
be used to beneﬁt wavefront sensing and image restoration.

8

We have written a code that implements the method presented in this paper. It has been tested for PD, PDS and MFBD,
but the other suggested processing strategies have not been tried yet. Trying some of the suggested strategies will be the
subject of future papers.

The code is new and as we apply it to diﬀerent problems we anticipate signiﬁcant improvements in the implementation
of the method as well as in the method itself. One particular area of improvement is the calculation of the null space matrix.
It consists of basis vectors for the null space and for any constraints matrix, there are inﬁnitely many null space matrices,
corresponding to rotations of the coordinate system in the null space. A method for making a null space matrix that is as
sparse and regular as possible would be very useful. Matrix multiplications involving sparse matrices can be performed
much faster than full matrices when the size of the problem is large. Also, a null space matrix such as the one in Fig. 1 is
so much more instructive and easy to interpret than the one in Fig. 2.

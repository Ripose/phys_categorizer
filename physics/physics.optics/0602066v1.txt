Rows of optical vortices from elliptically perturbing a high-order beam

Compiled February 2, 2008

An optical vortex (phase singularity) with a high topological strength resides on the axis of a high-order
light beam. The breakup of this vortex under elliptic perturbation into a straight row of unit strength
vortices is described. This behavior is studied in helical Ince-Gauss beams and astigmatic, generalized
Hermite-Laguerre-Gauss beams, which are perturbations of Laguerre-Gauss beams. Approximations of these
beams are derived for small perturbation, in which a neighborhood of the axis can be approximated by a
polynomial in the complex plane: a Chebyshev polynomial for Ince-Gauss beams, and a Hermite polynomial
for astigmatic beams.

The light beams most often studied have cylindrical sym-
metry – their intensity is invariant with rotation about
the optic axis. When such beams carry orbital angular
momentum,1 such as Laguerre-Gauss (LG)2 and Bessel
beams,3 they possess an axial optical vortex (phase sin-
gularity),4 where the intensity vanishes, and about which
the phase changes by 2πℓ. This integer vortex strength
ℓ equals the beam’s orbital angular momentum. For a
high-order beam (
> 1), the axial singularity is un-
ℓ
|
stable to perturbation. A simple example is the addition
of a small-amplitude cylindrical beam without a vortex
unit
(ℓ = 0), whence the axial vortex unfolds into
strength vortices which, in a transverse plane, are equally
spaced on a circle centered on the axis. Thus rotational
symmetry is broken from continuous to discrete.

Here, I want to draw attention to a natural class of
perturbations, where the high-order vortex breaks up
into a straight row of same sign unit strength vortices,
destroying rotational symmetry. At least three exam-
ples exhibit this: helical Ince-Gauss (IG) beams,5, 6 re-
lated to gaussian modes separated in elliptic coordinates;
their propagation-invariant analogue, Mathieu beams;7
and Hermite-Laguerre-Gauss (HLG) beams,8 generated
by astigmatic transformations of LG and Hermite-Gauss
(HG) beams. IG and HLG beams are perturbations of
LG beams; Mathieu beams, of Bessel beams.

The unfolding of high-order vortices into rows under
certain transformations is important in the understand-
ing of the physical structure of vortex cores.9, 10 In par-
ticular, in any synthesis of LG beams from HG modes
with mode converters,11 any misalignment will lead to a
row of closely spaced vortices, as will be described.

Two assumptions are made without loss of generality:
the description is conﬁned to the waist plane, and ℓ is
positive. A normalized LG beam, of mode order N =
ℓ + 2p, is therefore represented2

are polar coordinates, and w0 is the waist width. It is
proportional to Rℓ exp(iℓφ) = (x + iy)ℓ near the axis,
like any complex high-order beam.

A beam’s nodal structure may be understood in terms
of crossings of the zero contours of its real and imaginary
parts. For Rℓ exp(iℓφ), the real and imaginary contour
pattern consists of 2ℓ alternating, regularly spaced ra-
dial lines, reﬂecting the ℓ-fold rotational symmetry of
the phase singularity (see Fig. 1a). Adding a small real
constant a > 0 (approximating a vortex-free cylindrical
beam) only aﬀects the real contours (Fig. 1b), leading to
vortices at positions

a1/ℓ exp(2πin/ℓ) for n = 1, ..., ℓ.

This contrasts with elliptically perturbed beams,
where the high-order vortex breaks into a row of ℓ
vortices of strength +1. These beams are conjugation-
symmetric about the x-axis (real (imaginary) part
(anti)symmetric), with an imaginary zero at y = 0; vor-
tices occur where the real zero contours cross this line.
These vortices have the same sign, which appears to vi-
olate the sign rule,13 since they all lie on the same imag-
inary zero contour. However, between each pair of real
contours, another imaginary contour crosses the x-axis –
there is a phase saddle between adjacent vortices, which
must therefore have the same sign by the extended sign
rule.14 Examples are shown in Fig. 1c and d.

The presence of these saddles illustrates a general fea-
ture: upon perturbation, a high-order vortex unfolds, not
only to ℓ unit strength vortices, but also ℓ
1 saddle
points. This is because the Poincar´e index of phase gra-
dient (current) must be conserved; a vortex, of whatever
strength, is an index +1 circulation, so must be balanced
1 phase saddle points.14, 15 In perturba-
by ℓ
tion by a constant, these saddles remain degenerate at
the origin. These observations will now be justiﬁed for
helical IG beams, Mathieu beams, and HLG beams.

For the discussion of IG beams, the notation of Ref.
5 will mostly be adopted. In the waist plane, the real
and imaginary parts of helical IG beams are standing
IG modes (real part symmetric, imaginary part antisym-
metric). Each mode is a product of Ince polynomials5, 16
in elliptic coordinates u, v; contours of constant u (v) are

N (v, e), Cℓ

functions of Ince’s equation, which is of Sturm-Liouville
type: between adjacent zeros of Sℓ
N (v, e) must
have a zero.18 Thus helical IG beams possess a straight
row of alternating equal-sign zeros and saddles between
their foci, with positions corresponding to the zeros of

The transition from LG to helical IG beams has been
described as a perturbation; to see how the high-order
vortex becomes a row, it is instructive to study the limit
of small e. As e
0, Ince’s equation tends to the
equation of simple harmonic motion, and Cℓ

where Tℓ is a Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst kind12
(in the limit, the normalizations of C and S are equal17).
A neighborhood of the origin, of order f0, may there-
fore be approximated by a polynomial in the complex
plane, whose zeros, which scale with f0, are all on the
real axis. A consequence of this representation is that all
zeros have sign +1 (they are not poles), and their cores
are isotropic.19 This isotropy is somewhat surprising, as
one might expect the singularity phase structure to be
squeezed as the row contracts; the isotropy is ensured by
the complex analytic approximation.20

The argument for Mathieu beams is almost identical.
The vortex (saddle) positions on the row is given by the
zeros of (anti)symmetric Mathieu functions, which have
the same limiting behavior as Ince polynomials.

HLG beams are the ﬁnal example. They occur in ex-
periments when a HG or LG beam undergoes an astig-
matic transformation,8 due, for instance, to a cylindrical
lens or variable-phase mode converter,11 the perturba-
tion parameter being the orientation angle α of the lens.
(In the language of Ref. 11, θ = π/2 and φ = α.) They
can be mathematically understood using the analogy be-
tween gaussian beams in the waist plane and the quan-
tum 2D harmonic oscillator:21 HG states correspond to
linear, LG to circular, and HLG to elliptic orbits. Using
Schwinger’s analogy between the 2D harmonic oscilla-
tor and quantum spin,22 HLG beams may be written as
sums of LG beams whose coeﬃcients are spin rotation
matrix elements (Wigner d-functions). Therefore, the LG
beam ψLG,ℓ,p is perturbed by α to

Unlike IG beams, HLG beams cannot be expressed in
terms of a separable coordinate system (since only carte-
sian (HG), polar (LG) and elliptic (IG) are possible17).
Thus, vortex breakup into a row cannot be justiﬁed using
Sturm-Liouville analysis. Furthermore, for large enough
α, the negative vortices can appear on the row, which
ultimately vanishes (when α = π/4, the beam is HG).
However, the high-order vortex of ψLG does break into a
row of vortices and saddles for small α, and in fact, may
be approximated by a complex analytic function.

where Hℓ is the ℓth Hermite polynomial.12 That is, for
small α and R, a HLG beam is proportional to a Hermite
polynomial in the variable (x + iy)/2w0√α; this is again
a complex analytic approximation, so the ℓ zeros have
strength one and are isotropic. The vortices lie in a row
since Hermite polynomials have real zeros.

I have described the phenomenon of the breakup of a
high-order phase singularity in a rotationally symmet-
ric beam into a straight row of equal sign, unit strength
singularities, and gave explicit examples for helical Ince-
Gauss and generalized Hermite-Laguerre-Gauss (astig-
matic) beams. In each case, the unfolded row of ℓ vortices
scales by the square root of the dimensionless perturba-
tion parameter (e or α), as this tends to zero. In this
limit, the transverse neighborhood of the beam axis is
approximated by a polynomial depending on the com-
plex variable x + iy, with real zeros, automatically im-
plying a straight row of vortices with equal sign. The
intensity near the row is also proportional to the pertur-
bation strength (given explicitly in Eq. (7)).

Helical IG and HLG beams are distinct, since Eqs. (3)
and (7) involve diﬀerent polynomials; each row’s rela-
tive vortex spacings are diﬀerent. It is likely that elliptic
perturbations can be characterized using group theory,17
but this is outside the scope of the present work.

In a paraxial beam, an optical vortex is a trans-
verse solution of Laplace’s equation, so it has the form

try implies an axial vortex is isotropic (a = 0). Isotropy
of the unfolded vortices implies that the perturbation,
to leading order, only involves cylindrical beams of the
same sign. An anisotropic, high-order vortex thus will
unfold into anisotropic vortices, and not approximable
by a function of x + iy. Of course, there are many other
ways an order ℓ LG beam may be perturbed, involving
beams of the same mode order. However, it is quite dif-
ﬁcult to construct superpositions in this way leading to
vortex rows; nevertheless, the elliptic perturbations de-
scribed here are physically natural.

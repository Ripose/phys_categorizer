1 Mie Theory

Gustaw Mie in 1908 had considered a problem of the light scattering by the
macroscopic dielectric spheres. Mie ﬁnd an exact solution of the problem of
diﬀraction the plane wave on the homogenous sphere with constant density.
Similar solution was published by Debay.

The Mie solution satisﬁes also the scattering on many spheres with the
same structure and diameter – like scattering on the drops. The Mie solutions
in widely used in various situations up to nowadays.

Many scientists ([1], [2], [3], [4] and others) show a lot of simply models,
more simply than Mie’ s to application. Unfortunately, all of this approxima-
tions, works only in strictly deﬁned area (sometimes with great error). For
precisely calculation done in all the spectrum of measure we must used the
main theory, now is only one such theory – Mie Theory.

On the long distances, the process of light scattering is described by

amplitude A of electric ﬁeld E:

E as

= A

exp(ikr)
ikr

, kr >> 1.

The dependencies of angle give us angle distribution like:

dσ/dΩ = |A/ik|2 .

After integration over all angles it takes us total cross section. Amplitude
can be write also in such form:

A = n × (e × n) H1 + n × (e × k) H2

This form is more useful for calculation of physically dependencies. For
example, amplitude of radiation, with parallel polarisation, is equal to:

Ak = (H1 cos θ + H2) cos ϕ,

and for perpendicular

A⊥ = − (H1 + H2 cos θ) sin ϕ .

For non-polarised wave the intensity of reﬂected light is equal:

I⇓ (θ) =

|H1 cos θ + H2|2 ,

I⊥ (θ) =

|H1 + H2 cos θ|2 .

These components give us total intensity I(θ) :

I(θ) =

1 + cos2 θ

(cid:0)
Polarisation P (θ) is given as:

|H1|2 + |H2|2

+ 2 cos θ Re (H1H ∗
2 )

(cid:1)

If H2 = 0, then we get the known Rayleigh’s results for amplitude

Intensity is expressed by:

and polarisation as:

P (θ) = sin2 θ

|H1|2 − |H2|2
2I(θ)

.

AR = n × (e × n)H1.

IR(θ ) =

1 + cos2 θ

|H1|2 ,

PR(θ ) =

sin2 θ
1 + cos2 θ

.

2 The Mie sum for amplitude H

We consider electrical ﬁeld satisﬁed the Maxwell equations [5], [6], [7], [8]. If
t = cos ϑ, then:

(10)

H1 = (M − tE)′, H2 = (E − tM)′.

Using an operator notation [7] we can write:

Both E and M have a well-known structure:

= ˆOphl (α) jl (β)

D(p)
l
ˆOM = β∂β − α∂α
ˆOE = α∂β − β∂α

α = kR
β = NkR.

E =

2l + 1
l(l + 1)

P ′l(t)El,

M =

P ′l(t)Ml,

2l + 1
l(l + 1)

El = eiδ E

l sin δ E

l =

Ml = eiδ M

l sin δ M

l =

where Pl (t) are the Legendre polynomials. Now, E and M can be written as

where jl(z), hl(z) are cylindrical functions of Bessel and Hankel (ﬁrst kind
functions). We can write now the electric part

and magnetic one

El =

jl(α )j′
hl(α )j′

l(β ) − Nj′
l(β ) − Nh′

l(α )jl(β )
l(α )jl(β )

,

Ml =

Njl(α )j′
Nhl(α )j′

l(β ) − j′
l(β ) − h′

l(α )jl(β )
l(α )jl(β )

.

3 Approximations

For small α, the scattering cross-section was written by Lord Rayleigh [17],
[18], [16]:

QR =

8α4
3

(N 2 − 1)2
(N 2 + 2)2 .

For water, this approximation work for α < 0.5 with error smaller than 1%.
In range of α >> 1, good approximation take us the formula of van de Hulst
[3]:

QH = 2

1 − 2

(cid:20)

sin δ
δ

+ 2

1 − cos δ
δ2

(cid:21)

, δ = 2α(N − 1) .

(20)

Scattering cross - section is deﬁned as:

σsc =

dΩ |A/k|2 .

Z

After normalisation by πa2 is equal:

Q =

(2l + 1)

2
α2

∞

Xl=1

|El|2 + |Ml|2
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

.

So, we obtained total cross section.

4 FMA - Fast Mie Algorithm

(19)

(21)

(22)

Our program calculated Eq.(22). This program is written in Turbo Pascal
language. The structure of algorithm is very simple so the translation to
another language can take no more like some minutes.

In program we used recursion, so the time of calculation is minimized
to some seconds for thousand of dates. Recursion used main properties of
calculated functions and is most eﬃcient for great alpha.

Program generates the data ﬁle with location C:\MIE.DAT.

plots we can see very interesting structure with resonances Fig 3,4 and 5.

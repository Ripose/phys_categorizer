Abstract

We study the free-propagation features of an optical ﬁeld endowed with
a non-uniform polarization pattern with elliptical symmetry. The ﬁelds
derived in this way are called Elliptically Symmetric Polarized Beams
(ESPB for short). Some properties of these ﬁelds are analysed. Moreover,
it is shown how it is possible to obtain such light beams by applying the
results to Bessel-Gauss beams.

Introduction

Recently there was a growing interest, in the Optics community, towards those
optical ﬁelds possessing unusual polarization features; this because some phe-
nomena have shown to be strongly dependent by vectorial properties of the ﬁeld.
For instance, it was experimentally demonstrated that a radially polarized ﬁeld
can be focused to spot size of extension much smaller than that obtainable by
using a linear polarized one [1]. Also, azimuthally and radially polarized ﬁelds
[2] have found use in many sector of optics, like particle beam trapping, optical
microscopy, superrisolution [3], specially when these polarization features are
associated to a particular intensity proﬁle (the so-called donut beams are an
example of that) which implies the presence of a strong longitudinal compo-
nent of the optical electric ﬁeld; moreover it was shown that beams possessing
ﬁeld lines in the shape of a spiral, namely spirally polarized beams, are suit-
able to describe ﬁelds with vortices in their phase transverse proﬁle [4]. In the
present paper we wish to widen this scenario, by introducing coherent beams
with a non-uniform polarization state with an elliptical symmetry. By doing
so, we wish to show how some of the aforesaid properties are easily extendable
to other polarization’s geometry and where the diﬀerences among these kinds
of polarizations reside. The paper is organized as follows:
in section 2, after
having recalled brieﬂy some deﬁnitions about cylindrical coordinate system, we
specialize the subject to elliptical coordinate system; in section 3 we derive some
results in paraxial optics regime by applying the theory to Bessel-Gauss beams.

2 Curvilinear coordinate system

Let us suppose we have a free-space beam, which propagates along a mean di-
rection, say z-axis, on starting from a source-plane on which we know the ﬁeld

1

In this context the term non-uniform,
distribution of amplitude and phase.
when addressed to the ﬁeld polarization features, implicity refers to the trans-
verse component of the same ﬁeld analysed through a rectangular (Cartesian)
coordinate system. So we say that a polarization is non-uniform if, while mov-
ing along a ﬁxed direction in the (x, y) plane, we see the vector ﬁeld changing
in direction when compared with the unit vector basis ˆx and ˆy. Actually, it
should still be possible to ﬁnd a new coordinate system respect to which the
ﬁeld mantains its polarization state. In other words, the ﬁeld should be uni-
formly polarized respect to this new coordinate system. In a generical cylindrical
orthogonal reference frame we can write the ﬁeld, across the plane z = 0, as

where

ET(q1, q2, 0) = E1(q1, q2, 0)ˆq1 + E2(q1, q2, 0)ˆq2

indicates the trasverse ﬁeld and ˆq1, ˆq2 and z indicate the vector basis of a gener-
ical cylindrical orthogonal coordinate system, which is related to a Cartesian
orthogonal system by the following relationships

E = ET + Ez ˆz

x = g1(q1, q2)
y = g2(q1, q2)

z = z

(1)

(2)

(3)

where g1 and g2 are smooth functions of q1, q2 variables. Rectangular, circular
and elliptical ones are special cases of equations (3). The ﬁrst and the second
kind have receveid more attention than remainder. In particular, speaking about
the circular symmetry, recently several authors have focused their attention on
ﬁelds polarized in a radially or azimuthally way whereas the third case, for
which also it is possible to speak of radially or azimuthally polarization, does
not have received any attention at all. This fact is a little odd, specially if one
thinks the way in which a radially or azimuthally circular polarized ﬁeld can be
obtained in practice [5]. For instance, one of the methods to obtain a radially
polarized beam is to combine coherently an Hermite-Gauss beam of order (0, 1)
and an analogous beam, but of order (1, 0), both arising from a laser beam,
on supposing that amplitude and phase of the two beams are the same. There
exist other metods, but all of them also suppose to have a very good control
of the amplitude of the two components that one adds togheter. Actually this
is true only approximately and in practice one can consider the eﬀect of some
diﬀerence in amplitude between the two emerging beams, a diﬀerence which
gives rise just to an elliptical symmetry.
In the next section we analyse the
behaviour of a ﬁeld decomposed in a radial (but elliptical) component and in a
azimuthal (but elliptical too) component and we will show the connection with
the circular case.

2.1 Elliptical coordinate system

Recall some deﬁnition. An elliptical coordinate system is described from the
following relationships

x = coshξ cosη

2

y = sinhξ sinη

z = z

between x, y, z Cartesian variables and ξ, η, z elliptical ones. We recall that, in
analogy to the circular case, ξ assumes the role of radial variable, with ξ ∈ [0, ∞),
and η that of angular variable, with η ∈ [0, 2π). As it will be of some use in the
continuation of the present paper, also we report here the connection between
the unit vectors of rectangular (ˆx, ˆy) and elliptical ( ˆξ, ˆη) system

2

ˆξ = (cosh

ξ − cos
ˆη = (cosh2ξ − cos2η)

2

−1/2

(ˆxsinhξcosη + ˆycoshξsinη)
η)
−1/2(−ˆxcoshξsinη + ˆysinhξcosη)

in which is easy to see that, contrary to the Cartesian case, ˆξ and ˆη are not
constant on the transverse plane. In Figure 1 we report the curves respectively
calculated by ﬁxing ξ and η coordinate. They are families of ellipses of equation

and hyperbolae of equation

In the next section we will utilize this basis to decompose a vector ﬁeld in a
radial and azimuthal elliptical component.

2.2 Vectorial beam in elliptical reference frame
Let us suppose we have a ﬁeld like that in equation (1) and ET be

ET = Af (r, z)cos(θ + α)ˆx + Bf (r, z)sin(θ + α)ˆy

(8)

where A and B indicate two arbitrary real constants, f (r, z) is a radial-circular
function across a z plane and α is a constant angle. We suppose here that
A 6= B.
It is straightforward to show that the ﬁeld in equation (8) can be
rewritten as follows

ET = Cf (r, z)[sinhξcos(θ + α)ˆx + coshξsin(θ + α)ˆy]

by choosing the terms C and ξ as

C = B2 − A2

coshξ =

B
C

Equation (9) is interesting because allows to write the ﬁeld ET as a linear
combination of a radial-elliptical and an azimuthal-elliptical part. Indeed, by
using equation (5) we obtain

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(9)

(10)

(11)

ET = Cf (r, z)[(sinhξcosθˆx + coshξsinθˆy)cosα +

(cosα ˆξ + sinαˆη)
= Eξ ˆξ + Eη ˆη

= Cf (r, z)(cosh

where we have introduced the elliptical components Eξ = Cf (r, z)cosα(cosh2ξ−
cos2θ)1/2 and Eη = Cf (r, z)sinα(cosh2ξ − cos2θ)1/2. In equation(12) the angle
α plays a very important role, the polarization features of the ﬁeld depending
from its value. Indeed we can ﬁnd the ﬁeld lines by imposing the condition

d( ˆξξ)
dη

=

ET
|ET|

ˆξ +

|ET|

ˆη

and obtain

dξ
dη

=

Eξ
|ET|

ξ =

Eη
|ET|

(recall that d ˆξ/dη = ˆη). The system in equation (14) can be solved and it gives
the ﬁeld lines equation

ξ = ξ0exp(η/tanα)

(15)

where ξ0 is a constant parameter. Equation (15) represents an elliptical log-
arithmic spiral, and the ﬁeld in equation (12) is an elliptically symmetric and
spirally polarized beam. Spirally beams were introduced by Gori [4] for circular-
symmetric case. Here we found a natural extension to elliptically-symmetric
case. In the following we analyse some properties of this kind of beam. First of
all, we can see that when the angle α tends to zero the polarization tends to be-
come radial-elliptical, the ﬁeld being tangent to hyperbolae like that in equation
(7) whereas when α tends to ∞ the polarization tends to be azimuthal-elliptical,
the ﬁeld being tangent to ellipses described by equation (6). Also we note that
the beam described by equation (9) is anisotrope, i.e its tranverse intensity
pattern depends by θ angle. Indeed, for the intensity of transverse component
holds

2
IT (r, θ, z) ∝ |ET|

= C2|f (r, z)|2[cosh2ξ − cos2(θ + α)]

in which the angular dependence is evident. It is simple to see that the maximum
intensity directions are

(m = 0, 1, 2..)in which equation (16) becomes

θ1 = π/2 − α ± mπ

2
IT (r, θ, z) ∝ |ET|

= C2|f (r, z)|2cosh2ξ

so we can ﬁnd the value of angle α and, as a consequence, also the polariza-
tion kind, by intensity measurement, contrary to the circular-symmetric case in
which the intensity is dependent only to the radial coordinate r and does not give
any information about polarization. In other words, in the circular-symmetric
case all transverse intensity proﬁles associated to a particular polarization state
(radial, azimuthal, spiral ones, etc.) are undistinguishable one to another. In
the elliptical-symmetric case, one can obtain all the parameters, i.e. the ratio
B/A and the angle α, simply by the intensity transverse map measured across
a generical tranverse plane. Indeed, with reference to equation (16), by measur-
ing the maximum intensity direction one evalues the angle α (equation (17)),

whereas by measuring the angular-visibility ratio

νr =

(19)

one evalues the values of A and B (the indice r indicates that the radial coor-
dinate is ﬁxed). Also we note that the equation (16) never goes to zero, this
because the term cosh2ξ − cos2(θ + α) is diﬀerent to zero ∀ξ 6= 0 (the case ξ = 0
represents linear polarization and here is not considered). It follows that it ever
holds ν < 1. Obviously the ﬁeld in equation (8) can describe not only an ellip-
tic polarization but also a circular one: it is suﬃcient to remove the condition
A 6= B or, as it will be more clear in the next section, to consider high values
of ξ coordinate. It remains to see how one can obtain such a ﬁeld. This is the
purpose of the next section.

3 Elliptically Symmetric Polarized Bessel-Gauss

Beams

It is well known that Bessel-Gauss beams (BG beams for short) are solution of
scalar paraxial wave equation and that were introduced for the ﬁrst time by Gori
et al.[7]. In particular Gori introduced the linearly polarized BG beams of zero-
order, here denoted for convenience as BG0. Subsequently many authors have
been interested both to the generalization to vectorial [9] and to higher-order
BG beams, as well as to beam with unusual polarization features, as azimuthal
and radial ones [6]. Here we recall, for reader convenience, the form of a BG0

BG0 =

J0[

(1 + iz/L)

]exp[

−r2
w2(1 + iz/L)

]exp[

]

(20)

where J0 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind, L is the Rayleigh length, w is the
minimum spot size of the Gaussian beam, and β is the intensity of the tranverse
wave vector; to enlarge the vectorial treatise to encompasse also a non-uniform
elliptical polarization we start from a vectorial paraxial wave equation. On
starting from Maxwell’s equations in vacuum, in absence of sources, we arrive
to the following equation for the complete vector ﬁeld E

On introducing a ”slowly varying part” of E, say F, with

and by making use of the paraxial approximation, we obtain that F is governed
from the following equations [10]

∇T · FT + ikFz = 0
(24)
in which we have decomposed the ﬁeld F in longitudinal and transverse com-
ponent, i.e. F = FT + Fz ˆz. Now, if we decompose also the ﬁeld FT into

∇ × ∇ × E = k2E
∇ · E = 0

E = Fexp(ikz)

ial wave equations, each for single component,

∇2

(25)

T Fx + 2ik∂zFx = 0

T Fy + 2ik∂zFy = 0
∇
equation (25)-(26) can be rewritten as LFx = 0 and LFy = 0, after introduced
a linear diﬀerential operator L = ∂2
x + ∂2
y + 2ik∂z. Now, as the L operator
commutes with the inﬁnitesimal displacement operators [8] ∂x, ∂y and ∂z, it
is possible to obtain new solutions from known solutions by mean of arbitrary
diﬀerentiation. This observation will be crucial to obtain elliptically symmetric
polarized BG beams. Indeed, the ﬁrst thing to do is diﬀerentiating, respect to x
and y variables, a BG0 beam; in this way we obtain two new possible solutions
for a scalar paraxial wave equation: ∂xBG0 and ∂yBG0.
If we now linearly
combine them properly we ﬁnd the ESPB. To this purpose it is suﬃcient to let

(26)

Fx = A[∂x(BG0)cosα − ∂y(BG0)sinα]
Fy = B[∂y(BG0)cosα + ∂x(BG0)sinα]

(27)
(28)

in which A and B are two arbitrary constant, with A 6= B, and α, as usual,
is a constant angle. On utilizing the position in equations (10)-(11) we ﬁnally
obtain

FT(r, z) =

coshξsin(θ + α)ˆy]

In Figures (2) we report the intensity pattern of a ESP Bessel-Gauss beam,
evalued at diﬀerent transverse planes. We see that the beam mantains, during
its paraxial propagation, a zero in correspondence of z axis (a properties that is
shared with the classical donut beams). In Figure (3) we report the polarization
pattern, in correspondence to the z = 0 plane, in which is shown the behaviour
of tranverse ﬁeld for α = 0.8, and a ratio B/A = 10/3. On changing the sign of
the linear combination in equation (27) as well as the ratio B/A one can obtain
other interesting polarization pattern.
In Figure (4) we plot intensity across
the tranverse plane z = 0, for diﬀerent values of angle α. Before closing the
present section, we wish to say something about the longitudinal component of
the electric ﬁeld. To do that we will refer to the generical form of EPSB as
that in equation (9) and we shall use equation (24) to obtain the longitudinal
component in paraxial regime:

Fz =

∇T · FT

(30)

After straightforward calculations we ﬁnd

Fz = (∂rf (r, z) +

wich represents the full form of the longitutinal component in paraxial approxi-
mation. Here we see that, contrary to the circular-symmetric case for which an
azimuthally polarized ﬁeld does not give rise to a component along the z-axis,
when we have an azimuthal-elliptical polarization (for which α = π/2), Fz is
not null and holds

Fz = exp(−ξ)[

(∂rf (r, z) −

)sin2θ]

and it goes to zero as exp(−ξ). This is obvious if we recall that when ξ → ∞
the geometry polarization tends to become circular because for high value of
ξ, sinhξ ≈ coshξ ≈ exp(ξ) and the ellipses in equation (6) tends to become
circles. The fact that the longitudinal component changes its value by changing
coordinate system is well-known and it can be explained in a geometric point
of view. Indeed, equation (30) states that Fz is a divergence of a vectorial ﬁeld.
The divergence ∇T · FT counts the algebrical sum of sinks (i.e. where a ﬁeld
line of FT terminates) and sources (i.e. where a ﬁeld line of FT originates) into
a surface element, across a (x, y) plane. Since the divergence is a pseudoscalar,
namely we are dealing with a density, it is not invariant under a generical space
deformation. If, for example, the space is squeezed in a way by which the areas
are reduced, the density (i.e. Fz) increases. In practice, a distortion of space can
be thought as a transformation of coordinates and the fact that the divergence
operation is dependent by the coordinate system in which we work means that
we are dealing with metrical, and not topological, features of the ﬁeld [11].

4 Conclusion

We have introduced unconventionally polarized optical beams endowed with
elliptically-symmetric features in their tranverse polarization pattern. In par-
ticular we have derived a natural extension to elliptically-symmetric case of
spirally-polarized beams introduced by Gori [4] for circular symmetric case by
making use of another vectorial basis disposable to describe the polarization
feature of a ﬁeld, diﬀerent respect to the ”classical ones”, i.e. rectangular or
circular ones. Some properties of this kind of ﬁeld have been analysed. In partic-
ular, we have pointed out that, by using an elliptically-symmetric polarization,
the tranverse intensity proﬁle gives directly information about the polarization
state, the angular behaviour of the intensity depending from it. This implies
that it is possible to measure the ﬁeld polarization state only by an acquisition
of the intensity pattern across a generical tranverse plane. This is in contrast
with the analogous situation in circular-symmetric case, in which the intensity
pattern is indipendent from the particular polarization state. Indeed, a ﬁeld po-
larized in a radially way produces a tranverse intensity proﬁle identical to that
one produced by the azimuthally or spirally polarized ones, or any other com-
bination of them which mantains the circular symmetry. Due to its important
role in optics microscopy, we have reported also the form of the longitudinal
component for the electric ﬁeld, in paraxial approximation.

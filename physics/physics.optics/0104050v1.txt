We reelaborate on the basic properties of lossless multilayers. We show that the transfer matrices
for these multilayers have essentially the same algebraic properties as the Lorentz group SO(2,1) in
a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, as well as the group SL(2,R) underlying the structure of the ABCD
law in geometrical optics. By resorting to the Iwasawa decomposition, we represent the action of
any multilayer as the product of three matrices of simple interpretation. This group-theoretical
structure allows us to introduce bilinear transformations in the complex plane. The concept of
multilayer transfer function naturally emerges and its corresponding properties in the unit disc are
studied. We show that the Iwasawa decomposition reﬂects at this geometrical level in three simple
actions that can be considered the basic pieces for a deeper undestanding of the multilayer behavior.
We use the method to analyze in detail a simple practical example.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Layered media are important for many applications in
modern optics. To fully capitalize these media one must
have a clear picture of all the mechanisms involved in
the propagation of the optical waves in them. In spite of
this fact, multilayer optics is usually approached from a
practical view, in relation to optical ﬁlters and the like.
In this spirit, the topics covered in most of the textbooks
on the subject use a mixture of design, manufacture, and
applications; treating only the basic physics needed to
carry out practical computations [1].

However, for a variety of reasons layered media have
physical relevance on their own [2, 3]. The mathematical
basis for understanding their behavior is the fact that
the matrix representing any lossless multilayer belongs
to the group SU(1,1). It is known that this group is lo-
cally isomorphic to the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz group
SO(2,1) [4, 5]. This leads to a natural and complete iden-
tiﬁcation between reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients
of the multilayer and the parameters of the correspond-
ing Lorentz transformation. It is, precisely, the abstract
composition law of SU(1,1) the ultimate responsible for
the curious composition law of these reﬂection and trans-
mission coeﬃcients. Moreover, this fact allows one to
perform experimental tests of special relativity with sim-
ple optical measurements involving multilayers [6, 7, 8].
In this respect, another remarkable fact to be consid-
ered is that SU(1,1) is also isomorphic to SL(2,R), which
is the natural group underlying the mathematical struc-
ture of the celebrated ABCD law in ﬁrst-order optics. In
this paper, we also exploit this correspondence to explore

intriguing connections of layered media with geometrical
optics.

These purely algebraic results seem to call for a geo-
metrical interpretation. It is diﬃcult to overestimate the
role played by geometrical ideas in all the branches of
physics, particularly in special relativity. The hyperbolic
geometry associated with the group SU(1,1) [or, equiva-
lently, SO(2,1)] is an established doctrine [9]. In light of
these considerations, it is easy to convince oneself that
this geometrical approach might provide deeper insights
into the action of a multilayer in a wider unifying frame-
work that can put forward fruitful analogies with other
physical phenomena.

In consequence, it is natural to view the action of a
SU(1,1) multilayer matrix as a bilinear (or M¨obius) trans-
formation on the unit disc, obtained by stereographic
projection of the unit hyperboloid of SO(2,1). This kind
of bilinear representations have been discussed in detail
for the Poincar´e sphere in polarization optics [10, 11], for
Gaussian beam propagation [12], and are also useful in
laser mode-locking and optical pulse transmission [13].

In addition, the isomorphism with SL(2,R) allows us
to translate the geometrical structure deﬁned in the unit
disc to the complex plane, recovering in this way an al-
ternative model of the hyperbolic geometry that is useful
in shedding light into the behavior of the multilayer.

In spite of these achievements, the geometrical action
of an arbitrary lossless multilayer could still become cum-
bersome to interpret in physical terms. In fact, in prac-
tice it is usual to work directly with the numerical values
of a matrix obtained from the experiment, which cannot
be directly related to the inner multilayer structure. To

remedy this situation, we have resorted recently [14] to
the Iwasawa decomposition, which provides a remarkable
factorization of the matrix representing any multilayer
(no matter how complicated it could be) as the product
of three matrices of simple interpretation.

At the geometric level, such a decomposition trans-
lates directly into the classiﬁcation of three basic actions,
which are studied in this paper, that are the basic bricks
from which any multilayer action is built.

The contents of this paper are organized as follows.
In Section 2 we present in detail some relevant algebraic
properties of lossless multilayers. These properties have
a direct translation into hyperbolic geometry, both in the
unit disc and in the complex plane, which is explored in
Section 3. Finally, Section 4 devote to develop a simple
yet relevant example that illustrates the power of this
approach and to expose our concluding remarks.

II. SOME PROPERTIES OF LOSSLESS
MULTILAYER MATRICES

A. Transfer matrix for a lossless multilayer

We ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the essential ingredients of
multilayer optics we shall need for our purposes [10].
The conﬁguration is a stratiﬁed structure, illustrated in
Fig. 1, that consists of a stack of 1, . . . , j, . . . , m, plane–
parallel lossless layers sandwiched between two semi–
inﬁnite ambient (a) and substrate (s) media, which we
shall assume to be identical, since this is the common
experimental case. Hereafter all the media are supposed
to be lossless, linear, homogeneous, and isotropic.

a

We consider an incident monochromatic linearly polar-
ized plane wave from the ambient, which makes an angle
θ0 with the normal to the ﬁrst interface and has ampli-
tude E(+)
. The electric ﬁeld is either in the plane of
incidence (p polarization) or perpendicular to the plane
of incidence (s polarization). We consider as well another
plane wave of the same frequency and polarization, and
with amplitude E(−)
, incident from the substrate at the
s
same angle θ0. [15]

As a result of multiple reﬂections in all the interfaces,
we have a backward-traveling plane wave in the ambi-
ent, denoted E(−)
, and a forward-traveling plane wave
a
in the substrate, denoted E(+)
. If we consider the ﬁeld
amplitudes as a vector of the form

s

which applies to both ambient and substrate media, then
the amplitudes at each side of the multilayer are related
2 complex matrix Mas, we shall call the multilayer
by a 2
transfer matrix [16], in the form

are, respectively, the overall reﬂection and transmission

Therefore, the condition det Mas = +1 is equivalent to

matrices reduces to the group SU(1,1), whose elements
depend on three independent real parameters.

2 = +1.

(5)

When the ambient and substrate media are diﬀerent,
this result also holds after a convenient renormalization of
the ﬁeld amplitudes [4]. The identity matrix corresponds
to Tas = 1 and Ras = 0, so it represents an antireﬂec-
tion system. The matrix that describe the overall system
obtained by putting two multilayers together is the prod-
uct of the matrices representing each one of them, taken
in the appropriate order. So, two multilayers, which are
inverse, when composed give an antireﬂection system.

B. A basic factorization for multilayers: the
Iwasawa decomposition

Many types of matrix factorizations have been consid-
ered in the literature [17, 18, 19], all of them decomposing
the matrix as a unique product of other matrices of sim-
pler interpretation. Particularly, given the essential role
played by the Iwasawa decomposition, both in fundamen-
tal studies and in applications to several ﬁelds (especially
in optics), one is tempted to investigate also its role in
multilayer optics.

Without embarking us in mathematical subtleties, the
Iwasawa decomposition is established as follows [20, 21]:
any element g of a (noncompact semi-simple) Lie group
can be written as an ordered product of three elements,
taken one each from a maximal compact subgroup K,
a maximal Abelian subgroup A, and a maximal nilpo-
tent subgroup N . Furthermore, such a decomposition is
global (in the sense that it applies to every group ele-
ment) and essentially unique (in the sense that the el-
ements of the factorization are uniquely determined in
terms of g).

For the problem at hand of a lossless multilayer matrix

∈

SU(1,1), the decomposition reads as [14]
Mas = K(φ) A(ξ) N(ν) ,

corresponding limits on the parameters φ, ξ and ν, and
vice versa.

which is nothing but the energy-ﬂux conservation, as
could be expected from physical considerations. In ad-
dition, the matrix K(φ) preserves the product E(+)E(−),
the matrix A(ξ) preserves the quadratic form E(+)2
+
E(−)2
, and the matrix N(ν) preserves the sum E(+) +
i E(−).

C. Connections with geometrical optics

It this subsection we wish to show a remarkable anal-
ogy with geometrical optics that could provide new in-
sights into the interpretation of the action of any lossless
multilayer. To this end we note that by applying the
unitary matrix

to both sides of Eq. (2), we can recast it as

In other words, the matrices
as belong to the group
SL(2,R), which plays an essential role in a variety of
branches in optics, ranging from the celebrated ABCD
law of geometrical optics [22, 23, 24, 25], to squeezed
states in quantum optics [26, 27], including beam prop-
agation problems [28]. The transformation by
estab-
lishes a one-to-one map between the group SL(2,R) of
as and the group SU(1,1) of matrices Mas,
matrices
which allows for a direct translation of the properties
from one to the other. Such a correspondence is an iso-
morphism of groups, because

Now, we can interpret the physical action of the ma-
trices appearing in both factorizations in SU(1,1) and
SL(2,R), respectively. In this way, K(φ) represents the
free propagation of the ﬁelds E in the ambient medium
through an optical phase thickness of φ/2. Obviously,
this reduces to a mere shift of the origin of phases. Al-
ternatively, one can consider
(φ) as an ABCD matrix
in geometrical optics that applies to position x and mo-
mentum p (direction) coordinates of a ray in a transverse
plane [30]. These are the natural phase-space variables

of ray optics and then

these variables [28]. In the multilayer picture,
(−) can be seen as the

corresponding p.

In Eq. (7), the second matrix A(ξ) represents a sym-
metric multilayer (i.e., the reﬂection coeﬃcient is the
same whether light is incident on one side or on the op-
π/2)
posite side of the multilayer, and so τA
with transmission and reﬂection phase shifts of τA = 0
and ρA =
π/2, and a transmission coeﬃcient TA =
sech(ξ/2). There are many ways to get this performance,
perhaps the simplest one is a Fabry-Perot system com-
posed by two identical plates separated by a transpar-
ent spacer. By adjusting the refractive indices and the
thicknesses of the media one can always get the desired
values. Viewed in SL(2,R),
(ξ) represents a magniﬁer
that scales x up to the factor m = exp(ξ/2) and p down
by the same factor [28].

The third matrix, N(ν), represents a system having
TN = cos(τN) exp(iτN) and RN = sin(τN) exp(iτN), with

tan(τN) = ν/2. The simplest way to accomplish this
task is by an asymmetrical two-layer system. Using the
analogy with the ABCD matrix in geometrical optics,
(ν) represents the action of a lens of power ν [28].
Finally, in complete equivalence with the invariants
found for the Iwasawa decomposition of SU(1,1), the ma-

D. Connections with special relativity

Apart from the geometrical-optics perspective devel-
oped in the previous subsection, multilayer action can be
viewed in a relativisticlike framework, that has proved to
be very appropriate to understand some peculiarities of
multilayer behavior. To this end, let us ﬁrst recall some
well-known facts about the Lorentz transformations in
(2+1)-dimensions.

Introducing a three-dimensional real vector space of
vectors with components (x0, x1, x2), where x0 = ct, a
Lorentz transformation Λ is a linear transformation be-
tween two coordinate frames

x′µ

= Λµ

ν xν

(18)

(the Greek indices run from 0 to 2), such that the pseudo-

Thus, the set of Lorentz transformations can be classiﬁed
in two classes: proper transformations, with det Λ = +1,
1. The proper Lorentz
and improper ones, with det Λ =
transformations form a subgroup, but the improper ones
do not.

Furthermore, it is easy to check that

1. There-
fore, the transformations of the Lorentz group can also be
classiﬁed according to the sign of Λ0
0: the orthochronous
Lorentz transformations, with Λ0
1, form a subgroup,
0 ≥
but the antichronous ones, with Λ0
1, do not.
0 ≤ −

We are interested in dealing with the three-parameter
restricted Lorentz group SO(2,1); i.e., the group of the
Lorentz transformations with determinant +1 and that
do not reverse the direction of time.
In fact, we wish
to discuss now a very close correspondence between
the group SU(1,1) introduced above and the restricted
Lorentz group SO(2,1). We shall show this important
correspondence explicitly in the following form that we
recall for clarity [31]: with each point of our three-
dimensional vector space with coordinates xµ we asso-
ciate the Hermitian matrix

It is clear from Eq. (22) that the matrices M and
generate the same Λ, so this homomorphism is two-to-
one. This equation can be easily solved to obtain M
(uniquely deﬁned up to the sign) from a given Λ.

III. GEOMETRICAL INTERPRETATION OF
THE MULTILAYER ACTION

A. Multilayer transfer function and hyperbolic
geometry in the unit disc

In many instances (e.g., in polarization optics [10]) we
are interested in the transformation properties of ﬁeld
quotients rather than the ﬁelds themselves. Therefore, it
seems natural to consider the complex numbers

zs =

E(−)
s
E(+)
s

,

za =

E(−)
a
E(+)
a

.

(28)

The action of the multilayer given in Eq. (3) can be then
seen as a function za = f (zs) that can be appropriately
called the multilayer transfer function [16].

From a geometrical viewpoint, this function deﬁnes
a transformation of the complex plane C, mapping the
point zs into the point za, according to

za = Φ[Mas, zs] =

β∗ + α∗zs
α + βzs

,

(29)

and the point of the inﬁnity is given by

Φ[Mas,

α/β] =

−

,

∞

Φ[Mas,

] = α∗/β .

(30)

∞

This bilinear transformation deﬁnes an action of the
group SU(1,1) of multilayer transfer matrices on the com-
plex plane C. The complex plane appears then foliated
in three regions that remain invariant under the action of
the group: the unit disc, its boundary and the external
region. In fact,

and, in consequence, the diﬀerence between the numera-

which shows our assertion relative to the invariance of
those regions.

Alternatively, the unit disc can be seen as obtained
from the upper sheet of the unit two-sheet hyperboloid
deﬁned by Eq. (25) with K = 1 by means of stereographic
projection using the south pole (
1, 0, 0) as projection
centre. In fact, a simple calculation shows that, in such

−

a case, the projection of the point (e0, e1, e2) becomes in
the complex plane

e1 + ie2
1 + e0 =
in full agreement with Eq. (28).

z =

E(+) ,

The boundary of the unit disc corresponds to the pro-
jection of the inﬁnity point and then, since
=
1, it can be identiﬁed with the action of perfect mirrors
(i.e., Tas = 0).

The Iwasawa decomposition has an immediate trans-
lation in this geometrical framework, and one is led to
treat separately the action of each one of the matrices
appearing in this decomposition. To this end, it is worth
noting that the groups we are considering appear always
as groups of transformations of some space. The con-
cept of orbit is especially appropriate for obtaining an
intuitive meaning of the corresponding action. We recall
that, given a point P , its orbit is the set of points P ′
obtained from P by the action of all the elements of the
group. In Fig. 2 we have plotted a typical example of the
orbits for each one of the subgroups of matrices ΛK(φ),
ΛA(ξ), and ΛN(ν). For ΛK(φ) the orbits are the inter-
section of the hyperboloid with planes e0 = constant,
for ΛA(ξ) with planes e1 = constant, and for ΛN(ν) with
planes e0

e2 = constant.

Through stereographic projection, as indicated in
Fig. 2, we are working in the unit disc and the corre-
sponding orbits for the SU(1,1) matrices K, A, and N
are

−

z′ = Φ[K(φ), z] = z exp(

z′ = Φ[A(ξ), z] =

,

(34)

z′ = Φ[N(ν), z] =

As plotted in Fig. 3.a, for matrices K the orbits are cir-
cumferences centered at the origin. Since for these matri-
ces Ras = 0, the action of any antireﬂection system can
be always pictured as one of these circumferences. For
the matrices A, they are arcs of circumference centered in
i
the real axis and going from the point +i to the point
−
through z. Finally, for the matrices N the orbits are cir-
cumferences centered in the imaginary axis and passing
all of them through the points i, z, and

z∗.

The importance of the Iwasawa decomposition reﬂects
also at the geometrical level: no matter how complicated
a multilayer is, its action can always be viewed in terms of
these three basic actions with a clear geometric meaning.
Its explicit application to a real case will be demonstrated
in the next Section.

B. Hyperbolic geometry in the upper semi-plane

The unitary transformation (10) has played an impor-
tant role as intertwining between multilayer and geomet-
rical optics. One can expect that the structure deﬁned in

the unit disc for the former could be translated accord-
ingly for the latter. To this end, note that if the point
w

C is deﬁned in terms of z by

∈

w = Φ[

, z] =

U

z + i
1 + i z

,

(35)

it is easy to check that the interior of the unit disc is
mapped onto the upper semi-plane of the complex plane
w, the boundary maps onto the real axis, while the exte-
rior of the unit disc becomes the lower semi-plane.

The relationship between SU(1,1) and SL(2,R) out-
lined in Section 2 allows us to transport the action of
SU(1,1) onto C to give an action Ψ of SL(2,R) onto C,
ﬁnding in this way an alternative model of the hyperbolic
geometry and for determining the orbits of the matrices
of SL(2,R), that are the natural arena of geometrical op-
tics.

The corresponding orbits are now

IV. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE AND CONCLUDING
REMARKS

It seems pertinent to conclude by showing the power
of this geometrical approach. In consequence, we shall
analyze in some detail a practical example: a single glass
plate of refractive index n1 = 1.5 and thickness d1 = 1.1
mm embedded in air. The plate is illuminated with a
monochromatic light of wavelength in vacuo λ = 546 nm
that impinges from both ambient and substrate at an
angle θ0 = 45◦.

For this system a standard calculation gives the follow-

ing reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients:

Ras =

where r01 is the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcient at the inter-
face 01 (which applies to both p and s polarizations by
the simple attachment of a subscript p or s) and β1 is the
plate phase thickness

2π
λ

β1 =

n1d1 cos θ1.

(38)
If we take as initial condition that in the substrate
zs = 0.5 exp(iπ/6), then we obtain from Eqs. (37) the
value za =
0.6149 + 0.0498 i (for s polarization). In
Fig. 4 we have plotted these points zs and za in the unit
disc. Obviously, from these (experimental) data alone
we cannot infer at all the possible path for this discrete
transformation.

−

However, the Iwasawa decomposition remedies this se-
rious drawback: from the geometrical meaning discussed
before, and once we know the values of φ, ξ, and ν [that
are easily computed from Eqs. (8)] we get the intermedi-
ate values of z′ for the ordered application of the matrices
K(φ), A(ξ), and N(ν), which, in fact, determines that the
trajectory from zs to za is well deﬁned through the cor-
responding orbits, as shown in Fig. 4.

Moreover, and this is the important moral we wish to
extract from this simple example, if in some experiment
the values of zs and za are measured, one can ﬁnd, no
matter how complicated the multilayer is, in a unique
way, the three arcs of orbits that connect the initial and
ﬁnal points in the unit disc.

We stress that the beneﬁt of this approach lies not in
any inherent advantage in terms of eﬃciency in solving
problems in layered structures. Rather, we expect that
the formalism presented here could provide a general and
unifying tool to analyze multilayer performance in an ele-
gant and concise way that, additionally, is closely related
to other ﬁelds of physics, such as special relativity and
geometrical optics.

Abstract: We study the application of squeezed states in a quan-
tum optical scheme for direct sampling of the phase space by photon
counting. We prove that the detection setup with a squeezed coherent
probe ﬁeld is equivalent to the probing of the squeezed signal ﬁeld with
a coherent state. An example of the Schr¨odinger cat state measure-
ment shows that the use of squeezed states allows one to detect clearly
the interference between distinct phase space components despite losses
through the unused output port of the setup.

Introduction

Phase space quasidistribution functions are a convenient way of characterizing the quan-
tum state of optical radiation [1]. Over past several years, they have gained experimental
signiﬁcance due to the reconstruction of the Wigner function of a single light mode per-
formed using tomographic algorithms [2]. Recently, an alternative method for measuring
quasidistribution functions of a light mode has been proposed [3,4]. The method is based
on photon counting of the signal ﬁeld superposed on a probe ﬁeld in a coherent state.
The advantage of this method is that there is no complicated numerical processing of

the experimental data. A simple arithmetic operation performed on the photocount
statistics yields directly the value of a quasidistribution function at a point deﬁned by
the amplitude and the phase of the coherent ﬁeld.

The purpose of this communication is to study the application of squeezed states
in the proposed photon counting scheme. The most important feature of squeezed states
is that quantum ﬂuctuations in some observables are reduced below the coherent state
level [5]. In the context of optical homodyne tomography, the squeezing transformation
has been shown to be capable of compensating for the deleterious eﬀect of low detection
eﬃciency [6]. Therefore, it is interesting to discuss the information on the quantum state
of light which can be retrieved in a photon counting experiment using squeezed states.

2. Experimental scheme

We start with a brief description of the proposed setup, depicted in Fig. 1. The ﬁeld
incident on a photodetector is a combination, performed using a beam splitter with
a power transmission T , of a transmitted signal mode and a reﬂected probe mode.

which has a clear and intuitive interpretation within the Wigner function formalism:
the measured quantity is proportional to the phase space integral of the product of the
signal and the probe Wigner functions with relatively rescaled parameterizations [4].
Hence the proposed scheme is a realization of direct sampling of the quantum phase
space.

This observable is closely related to a certain quasidistribution function. The most
straightforward way to identify this link is to recall that an s-ordered quasidistribution
function at a complex phase space point β is given by the expectation value of the
normally ordered operator:

Fig. 1. The setup for direct probing of the quantum phase space. The detector
measures the photocount statistics {pn} of a signal ˆaS combined with a probe ﬁeld
ˆaP using a beam splitter with a power transmission T .

Thus, the alternating series computed from the photocount statistics yields the value
of a quasidistribution function at a point
T )/T α deﬁned by the amplitude and
the phase of the probe coherent ﬁeld. The complete quasidistribution function can be
p
scanned point–by–point by changing the probe ﬁeld parameters.

The ordering of the measured quasidistribution function depends on the beam
splitter transmission. This is a consequence of the fact that a fraction of the signal ﬁeld
escapes through the second unused output port of the beam splitter. These losses of
the ﬁeld lower the ordering of the detected observable. This eﬀect is analogous to the
one appearing in balanced homodyne detection with imperfect detectors [7,8]. In the
limit T
1, when the complete signal ﬁeld is detected, we measure directly the Wigner
function, corresponding to the symmetric ordering.

3. Sampling with squeezed state

We will now consider the case when a squeezed coherent state SP (r, ϕ)
P enters

through the probe port of the beam splitter. We use the following deﬁnition of the
squeezing operator for an ith mode:

Si(r, ϕ) = exp[r(e−iϕˆa2

eiϕ(ˆa†

The detected quantity is now given by the expectation value of the following operator
acting in the Hilbert space of the signal mode:

In order to ﬁnd an interpretation for this observable, we will derive a formula for
the squeezing transformations of the parity operator ˆΠ. We start from a simple unitary
transformation:

which states that generation or annihilation of pairs of photons conserves parity. There-
fore, the parity operator is invariant under the squeezing transformation:

ˆS†
out(r, ϕ) ˆΠ ˆSout(r, ϕ) = ˆΠ.

(11)

(13)

This identity has nontrivial consequences when written in terms of the signal and the
probe modes. It is equivalent to the equation:

S(r, ϕ) ˆS†
ˆS†

P (r, ϕ) ˆΠ ˆSP (r, ϕ) ˆSS(r, ϕ) = ˆΠ

which, after moving the signal squeezing operators to the right hand side, yields the
following result:

P (r, ϕ) ˆΠ ˆSP (r, ϕ) = ˆS†

This formula shows that squeezing of the probe mode is equivalent to squeezing of the
signal mode with the opposite sign of the parameter r. This change of the sign swaps the
ﬁeld quadratures that get squeezed or antisqueezed under the squeezing transformation.
Finally we obtain the following explicit expression for the detected signal ﬁeld

Let us note that it was possible to carry the squeezing transformation from the
probe to the signal degree of freedom only due to a speciﬁc form of the measured observ-
able. We have explicitly used the conservation of the parity operator during generation
or annihilation of pairs of photons. For a general observable deﬁned for the outgoing
mode ˆaout, there is no formula analogous to Eq. (13).

4. Detection of Schr¨odinger cat state

As an illustration, we will consider a photon counting experiment for a Schr¨odinger cat
state, which is a quantum superposition of two coherent states [9]:

where κ is a real parameter. The Wigner function of such a state contains, in addition
to two positive peaks corresponding to the coherent states, an oscillating term originat-
ing from quantum interference between the classical–like components. This nonclassical
feature is extremely fragile, and disappears very quickly in the presence of dissipation
[10].

p

As we have found in Eq. (14), the outcome of the photon counting experiment
with a squeezed probe ﬁeld is related to an s-ordered quasidistribution of the squeezed
Schr¨odinger cat state ˆSS(
. For simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the case

ϕ = 0. A simple but lengthy calculation yields the explicit formula for the phase space
quasidistribution at a complex point β = q + ip:

When coherent states are used, only a faint trace of the oscillatory pattern can be
noticed due to losses of the signal ﬁeld. In contrast, probing of the Schr¨odinger cat
state with suitably chosen squeezed states yields a clear picture of quantum coherence
between distinct phase space components. This eﬀect is particularly surprising if we
realize that 20% of the signal ﬁeld power is lost through the unused output port of the
beam splitter.

p

−

The visibility of the oscillatory pattern depends substantially on the sign of the
squeezing parameter r. This can be most easily understood using the Wigner phase space
description of the discussed scheme [4]. In order to detect the interference, ﬂuctuations
in the probe squeezed states have to be reduced in the direction corresponding to the
rapid oscillations of the Wigner function corresponding to the Schr¨odinger cat state.
The width of the rescaled probe Wigner function along the squeezed direction must be
smaller than the spacing between the interference fringes.

5. Conclusions

We have studied the quantum optical scheme for direct sampling of the quantum phase
space using squeezed coherent states. We have shown that squeezing transformations
performed on the signal and the probe input ports of the setup are equivalent. The
application of squeezed states with the appropriately chosen squeezing direction allows
one to detect quantum interference despite losses through the unused output port of
the setup.

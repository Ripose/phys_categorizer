INTRODUCTION

Focusing of light has drawn considerable attention for many centuries due to its impor-

tance in many ﬁelds of physics. Microscopy, spectroscopy and optical data storage are only

a few of the ﬁelds utilizing focused light. The earliest treatment of electromagnetic focusing

problems are due to Ignatowsky[1]. However, the structure of the focused ﬁeld was not

clariﬁed until the 1950’s and 60’s, when Wolf and coworkers did the ﬁrst detailed studies of

aplanatic electromagnetic focusing systems[2, 3, 4]. Here the socalled Debye approximation

was adopted, where only the plane waves with propagation vectors that fall inside the geo-

metrical cone whose apex is at the focal point contribute to the ﬁeld in the focal region[2, 5].

The Debye approximation predicts that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is symmetrical about the

focal plane. However, later it was found that the Debye theory is valid only when the focal

point is located many wavelengths away from the aperture, the angular aperture is suﬃ-

ciently large, and the wavefront deviation kept reasonably low[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In the general

case the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not symmetrical about the geometrical focal plane, and

focal shifts may occur.

Focusing through dielectric interfaces is of broad interest since this geometry is often

used in optical data storage and biology (see e.g. Refs.

[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

and references therein). To date, most studies have concentrated about focusing through a

dielelectric interface with its normal along the optical axis. However, in some applications

it is of importance to understand what happens when the interface is tilted. For example,

consider an optical disk which rotates around its axis in a DVD player. If the disk is slightly

tilted (e.g. by shaking the DVD player), then the wavefront is aberrated, and the focus

is distorted. To ﬁnd out how much the focus is distorted, it is most common to perform

optical ray tracing or use scalar wave theory (see e.g. Refs. [16, 17] and references therein).

However, also in the case of electromagnetic focusing it is of interest to obtain an explicit

expression for the intensity distribution in the focal region, since this may give a clearer

understanding of the physical problem. The aim of this Letter is to treat the problem of

electromagnetic focusing through a tilted dielectric interface in more detail. First I will

formulate the problem, and then look at the small angle limit in the Debye approximation.

It should be emphasized that no numerical analysis is given here.

II. GENERAL FORMULATION

In general, the diﬀracted ﬁeld near the focal plane can be calculated in the Kirchoﬀ

approximation as [11]

E = −

where ki = 2πni/λ is the wavenumber in medium i, si = (six, siy, siz) is the unit vector along
a typical ray, and T the vector pupil distribution which accounts for the polarization, phase

and amplitude distributions at the exit pupil. Let us consider focusing through a tilted

isotropic dielectric interface when the optical axis crosses the interface at a distance zi = −d

(see Fig. 1). Without loss of generality, we let the angle β be the tilting angle about the

y-plane. Thus, the z-coordinate at the interface is given by zi = −d + xtanβ. When β = 0
we have s1 = (s1x, s1y, s1z). The unit vector corresponding to a ﬁnite tilt angle is then given
by a rotation of the coordinate system s′

1 = Ks1, where

and s′

1 = (s1xcosβ − s1zsinβ, s1y, s1xsinβ + s1zcosβ). Here we have used the equivalence be-

tween tilting the optical axis and the dielectric interface for a single ray. We will see that this

change of coordinate system is useful for expressing the electric ﬁeld in the second medium.

Moreover, Snell’s law is now expressed as; n1s1y = n2s2y and n1(s1xcosβ − s1zsinβ) = n2s2x.

We note that these equations are not valid when n1 = n2 and β 6= 0, since in this case

we can not immediately assume equivalence between tilting the (absent) substrate and the

optical axis.

and

note that

It is convenient to write the electric ﬁelds in the ﬁrst and second media as (see also Ref.

Moreover, we must match the electric ﬁeld at the interface, which gives

where F (s1, β) is the transmission factor (Fresnel coeﬃcients) through the tilted surface.

Now we may write

T 2 = ˜T (s1, β) exp(iΨM + iΨT ) ,

˜T (s1, β) =

where

and

ΨM and ΨT are given by

ΨT = xtanβ(k1s1z − k2s2z) .

(10)

Naturally, ΨT vanishes when there is no index mismatch. Note also that s2z =

1 − s2

2x − s2

This is expression enable us to calculate the electric ﬁeld for reasonable tilt angles in the

Kirchoﬀ approximation. In the next section I will study the special case of high angular

apertures and small tilt angles, and it will be shown that only a simple aberration term

remains.

III. SMALL TILT ANGLES IN THE DEBYE APPROXIMATION

We now consider focusing with high angular aperture assuming that the Debye approxi-

mation can be used. Then only the plane waves with propagation vectors that fall inside the

geometrical cone whose apex is at the focal point contribute to the ﬁeld in the focal region.

Moreover, we assume that β ≪ 1 and z = 0. Then the inﬂuence of β on ˜T (s1, β) can be

neglected, and only the lowest order contribution in the phase remains. Equation (11) can

therefore be written as

E2 = −

where Ω is the solid angle formed by all the geometrical rays,

Ψ′

Ψ′

M = −dk1s1z + dk2s2z0 ,

u = dβ(k1/k2)(s1z/s2z0) and s2z0 =

by expanding s2z and only keeping the lowest order in β. Note that Ψ′

M is the usual

aberration introduced by focusing through a planar, nontilted dielectric surface, see Ref.

[15]. This aberration term will be neglected here, which is a reasonable approximation

for systems corrected for the index mismatch (in absence of tilting).

It is seen that the

tilt introduces a coordinate shift, u, which depends on the tilt and index mismatch. Note

in particular that u ≈ dβ when n1 ≈ n2, which is just the shift expected from a tilt

in the coordinate system. Moreover, u is clearly altered when the index mismatch and

numerical aperture change. In the further studies I will neglect this shift, concentrating on
the remaining aberration term Ψ′

T . This term is also nonzero when n1 ≈ n2. However, I

argue that it has the correct symmetry, and is a real aberration term due to the ﬁnite tilt β.

I now assume that the aperture is circular symmetric, which means that it is most con-

venient to adopt spherical coordinates:

si = (sinθicosφ, sinθisinφ, cosθi) ,

rc = (rcsinθccosφc, rcsinθcsinφc, z) .

and

Equation (12) can now be written as

In order to be able to evaluate this integral, it remains to ﬁnd the vector pupil function
˜T (θ1, φ). This can be done following the guidelines given in e.g. Ref. [18], which results in

˜T(θ1, φ) = A(θ1)

a[tpcosθ2cos2φ + tssin2φ] + b[tpcosθ2sinφcosφ − tssinφcosφ]
a[tpcosθ2cosφsinφ − tssinφcosφ] + b[tpcosθ2sin2φ + tscos2φ]

−tpsinθ2[acosφ + bsinφ]

where A(θ1) is an apodization factor, a(θ1, φ) is the strength of the incident x polarized

light, b(θ1, φ) the strength of the incident y polarized light and tp,s the Fresnel transmission

coeﬃcients. In the case of linearly polarized light (a=1, b=0) we obtain the following electric

ﬁeld components:

Ex ∝ i (I0 + I2cos2φc) ,

Ey ∝ iI2sin2φc ,

Ez ∝ 2I1cosφc ,

(24)

We see that now the only eﬀect of the tilt is to introduce an aberration term which depends

on the azimuthal angle φc as well as θ1. When β = 0, these equations reduces to the ones

found in e.g. Refs. [15, 18].

In conclusion, focusing through a tilted dielectric interface has been investigated. It is

found that the tilt introduces additional aberration terms.

In the small angle limit and

Debye approximation, only a simple aberration term remains.

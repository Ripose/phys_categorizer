A two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavity design supporting a wavelength-scale volume resonant mode
with a calculated quality factor (Q) insensitive to deviations in the cavity geometry at the level of Q & 2 ×
104 is presented. The robustness of the cavity design is conﬁrmed by optical ﬁber-based measurements of
passive cavities fabricated in silicon. For microcavities operating in the l = 1500 nm wavelength band, quality
factors between 1.3-4.0 × 104 are measured for signiﬁcant variations in cavity geometry and for resonant mode
normalized frequencies shifted by as much as 10% of the nominal value.

Two-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) slab waveguide
microcavities[1, 2] offer the promise of simultaneously
exhibiting a high quality factor (Q) and an ultra-small,
wavelength-scale modal volume (Veff). These two parame-
ters, which physically represent long photon lifetimes and
large per photon electric ﬁeld strengths, respectively, are key
to microcavity-enhanced processes in nonlinear optics, quan-
tum optics, and laser physics[3, 4, 5, 6]. Recent progress
on PC microcavities has included theoretical work on the
design of PC microcavities with predicted Q factors from
104 to 106[7, 8, 9], and experimental work demonstrating Q
factors in excess of 104 in InP-based lasers[10] and silicon
membranes[11, 12]. A range of microcavity designs have
been employed in these studies, and in many cases, the ex-
perimental achievement of high-Q is predicated on the ability
to fabricate the design with a small margin for error. For ex-
ample, in Ref.
[2], the discrepancy between the fabricated
device and the intended design led to a theoretical degrada-
tion of Q from 3.0 × 104 to 4.4 × 103, consistent with the
measured Q of 2.8 × 103. Extraordinary control over fabri-
cated geometries has been demonstrated in recent work[11],
where a shift of ∼ 60 nm in the positions of holes surround-
ing the cavity defect region reduced Qs as high as 4.5 × 104
by over an order of magnitude. Here, we discuss work on a
PC microcavity[10, 12] that exhibits a degree of robustness,
both theoretically and experimentally, to deviations from the
nominal design sufﬁcient for Qs above 104 to be maintained.
This robustness in Q to changes in the PC cavity geometry
is of practical importance for future experiments in the afore-
mentioned disciplines, to provide insensitivity to fabrication
imperfections, as well as to maintain the ﬂexibility in cavity
design required to form resonant modes with a prescribed ﬁeld
pattern and polarization.

Radiative losses in planar waveguide two-dimensional PC
defect microcavities can be separated into in-plane and out-
of-plane components, quantiﬁed by the quality factors Qk and
Q⊥, respectively, with the total radiative Q given by Q−1 =
Q−1
k + Q−1
⊥ . Qk is determined by the size and angular extent
(in-plane) of the photonic bandgap, while Q⊥ is determined
by the presence of in-plane momentum components (k) within
the waveguide cladding light cone, which are not conﬁned by
total internal reﬂection at the core-cladding interface. In Ref.

2 mode.

cavity with a graded defect design (PC-5 described below).

[8], PC microcavities were designed using two mechanisms
to avoid radiative loss: (i) use of a mode that is odd about
mirror planes normal to its dominant Fourier components, in
order to eliminate the DC (k = 0) part of the in-plane spatial
frequency spectrum and hence reduce vertical radiation loss,
and (ii) use of a grade in the hole radius to further conﬁne the
mode and reduce in-plane radiative losses. The resulting PC
microcavity design within the square lattice creates a TE-like
(magnetic ﬁeld predominatly along ˆz) donor-type defect mode
(labeled A0
2[17]) as shown in Fig. 1(a). FDTD simulations of
this resonant mode predict a Q-factor of 105 and an effective
modal volume of Veff ∼ 1.2(l /n)3. We now show how use of
mechanisms (i) and (ii) above create a level of robustness in
the cavity design.

Use of an odd symmetry mode to suppress vertical radiation
loss is, at a basic level, independent of changes in the size of
the holes deﬁning the defect cavity. This feature has been con-
ﬁrmed in simulations of simple defect cavity designs in square
lattice photonic crystals[8], where Q⊥ did not degrade be-
low 104, despite signiﬁcant changes (as much as 40%) in the
size of the (two) central defect holes. Perturbations that cause
the cavity to be asymmetric create a mode which, though not
strictly odd, will be a perturbation to an odd mode, and hence
will still largely suppress DC Fourier components and exhibit
high Q. However, for the square lattice photonic crystal struc-
tures considered here, perturbations to the central defect hole

the design less susceptible to ﬂuctuations in the size of indi-
vidual holes. Instead, the continuous change in the position
of the conduction band-edge resulting from the grade in hole
radius creates an approximately harmonic potential well[13].
This smooth change in the position of the band-edge creates
a robust way to mode-match between the central portion of

work[11], softening of this transition is achieved by adjusting
the position of two holes surrounding the central cavity region
(which consists of three removed air holes in a hexagonal lat-
tice). This method can achieve high-Q, but as mode-matching
is achieved by tailoring only two holes it is more sensitive to
perturbations than the adiabatic transition created by a grade
in the hole radius. Finally, we note that even though a rela-
tively large number of holes are modiﬁed to create the graded
lattice, Veff is still wavelength-scale, and remains between 0.8-
1.4(l /n)3 in all of the devices considered in this work. In ad-
dition, the methods used here to achieve robustness in Q are
general and can be applied to cavities in other PC lattices[14].
To highlight these ideas, 3D FDTD simulations of cavities
with varying grades and average normalized hole radius (¯r/a)
were performed. Figure 2(a)-(b) shows the grade in r/a along
the central ˆx and ˆy axes for several designs (PC-A through PC-
E), and Table I lists the calculated resonant frequency, verti-
cal, in-plane, and total Q factors. In all of these simulations,
Q⊥ remains close to 105, with PC-E showing more signiﬁ-
cant degradation largely as a result of the increased modal fre-
quency (creating a larger-sized cladding light cone). In addi-
tion, an inappropriate choice of grade along the ˆx-axis can lead
to increased in-plane losses via coupling to M-point modes.
Nevertheless, the loss in any of the simulated devices did not
cause Q to be reduced below 2 × 104.

To test the sensitivity of the design to perturbations experi-
mentally, cavities were fabricated in a d=340 nm thick silicon
membrane through a combination of electron beam lithogra-
phy, inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion etching, and wet
etching. Figure 2(c)-(d) shows the values of r/a along the
central ˆx and ˆy axes for a number of fabricated devices (PC-1
through PC-7), as measured with a scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM). Cavities are passively tested[12] using an opti-
cal ﬁber taper[15], which consists of a standard single mode
optical ﬁber that has been heated and stretched to a minimum
diameter of 1-2 µm. At such sizes, the evanescent ﬁeld of
the ﬁber mode extends into the surrounding air, providing a
means by which the cavity modes can be sourced and out-
coupled. The ﬁber taper is spliced to the output of a ﬁber-
pigtailed scanning tunable laser (1565-1625 nm) with 1 pm
resolution, and is mounted (Fig. 3(a)) above and parallel to
an array of PC cavities (Fig. 3(b)). When it is brought into
close proximity (∼ 500 nm) to the sample surface, evanescent
coupling between the taper and cavity modes occurs.

Fig. 3(c)-(d) shows measurements for devices PC-5 and
PC-6, which have signiﬁcantly different r/a proﬁles (Figure
2(c)-(d)). The inset of Fig. 3(c) shows the normalized taper
transmission as a function of wavelength when the taper is
350 nm above cavity PC-5. By measuring the dependence of

geometry can result in a degradation in Qk, due in part to the
lack of a complete in-plane bandgap within the square lattice.
This lack of a complete bandgap requires the defect geometry
to be tailored so as to eliminate the presence of Fourier com-
ponents in directions where the lattice is no longer reﬂective.
This tailoring was achieved in Ref. [8] by a grade in the
hole radius moving from the center of the cavity outwards.
The grade, shown in Fig. 1, serves to help eliminate cou-
plings to in-plane radiation modes along the diagonal axes of
the square lattice (the M-point of the reciprocal lattice) where
the PC is no longer highly reﬂective, while simultaneously
providing a means to keep the in-plane reﬂectivity high along
the ˆy axis (the direction of the mode’s dominant Fourier com-
ponents). The use of a large number of holes to deﬁne the de-
fect region ensures that no single hole is responsible for creat-
ing the potential well that conﬁnes the resonant mode, making

3

largest hole sizes such as PC-7, which may have more vertical
sidewalls, also begin to exhibit higher vertical radiation loss as
a result of a larger modal frequency and cladding light cone.
In addition, surface roughness is a potential source of loss; for
PC-6, which exhibited the highest Q value, a chemical resist
stripping process was used (rather than a plasma de-scum) and
may have produced a cleaner, smoother surface.

In summary, the robustness in Q to errors in the in-plane
design of a PC microcavity consisting of a graded square lat-
tice of air holes is discussed. This property is conﬁrmed both
by FDTD simulations of devices where the steepness of the
grade and the average hole radius are varied without degrad-
ing Q below 2 × 104, and in measurements of microfabricated
Si cavities that exhibit Q factors between 1.3-4.0 × 104 over
a wide range of device parameters. For these high-Q cavities,
current limitations on the Q factor appear to stem principally
from slightly angled sidewalls and etched surface roughness,
as opposed to errors in the in-plane shape or size of holes.

cavity mode linewidth (g ) on the vertical taper-PC gap (D z)
(Fig. 3(c)), an estimate of the true cold-cavity linewidth (g 0)
is given by the asymptotic value of g reached when the taper is
far from the cavity. For PC-5, g 0 ∼ 0.065 nm, corresponding
to Q ∼ 2.5 × 104. Fig. 3(d) shows the linewidth measurement
for PC-6. For this device, g 0 ∼ 0.041 nm, corresponding to a
Q ∼ 4.0 × 104. As described in Ref. [12], the strength of the
taper-PC coupling as a function of taper position can be used
to estimate the spatial localization of the cavity ﬁeld; these
measurements closely correspond with calculations and for
PC-6 are consistent with an FDTD-predicted Veff ∼ 0.9(l /n)3.
These PC microcavities thus simultaneously exhibit a high-Q
factor that is insensitive to perturbations, and an ultra-small
Veff.

Linewidth measurements for each of the cavities PC-1
through PC-7 are compiled in Table I. The robustness of the Q
to non-idealities in fabrication is clearly evident. Though all
of the devices exhibit a general grade in r/a, the steepness of
the grade and the average hole radius (¯r/a) vary considerably
without reducing Q below 1.3 × 104. These high-Q values are
exhibited despite the fact that many cavities are not symmetric
(the odd boundary condition is thus only approximately main-
tained), and the frequency of the cavity resonance varies over
a 10% range, between a/l o = 0.243-0.270.

The measured Q values in Table I are still lower than
predicted from simulations. This discrepancy is likely due
in part to slightly angled etched sidewalls that have been
shown in calculations to lead to radiative coupling to TM-like
modes[16]. This non-ideality helps explain why PC-1, which
is closest in r/a value to the desired design (PC-A), does not
exhibit the highest Q experimentally. In particular, we have
observed that the sidewall angle is poorer for smaller sized
holes. On the other end of the spectrum, cavities with the

We address the long-standing unresolved problem concerning the V –parameter in a photonic
crystal ﬁber (PCF). Formulate the parameter appropriate for a core-defect in a periodic structure
we argue that the multi-mode cut-oﬀ occurs at a wavelength λ∗ which satisﬁes VPCF(λ∗) = π.
Comparing to numerics and recent cut-oﬀ calculations we conﬁrm this result.

In photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs) an arrangement of
air-holes running along the full length of the ﬁber pro-
vides the conﬁnement and guidance of light. The air-
holes of diameter d are typically arranged in a triangular
lattice[1] with a pitch Λ (see insert in Fig. 2), but e.g.
honey-comb[2] and kagome[3, 4] arrangements are other
options. By making a defect in the lattice, light can be
conﬁned and guided along the ﬁber axis. The guidance
mechanism depends on the nature of the defect and the
air-hole arrangement. For the triangular lattice with a
silica-core light is conﬁned by total-internal reﬂection[1]
whereas for an air-core a photonic-bandgap conﬁnes light
to the defect.[5] For recent reviews we refer to Ref. 6 and
references therein.

Both type of PCFs have revealed surprising and novel
optical properties.
In this work we consider the silica-
core PCF (see insert in Fig. 2) which was the one ﬁrst
reported.[1] This structure provides the basis of a va-
riety of phenomena including the endlessly single-mode
behaviour,[7] large-mode area PCFs,[8] as well as highly
non-linear PCF with unique dispersion properties.[9, 10,
11]

Properties of standard ﬁbers are often parametrized
by the so-called V –parameter and the entire concept is
very close to the heart of the majority of the optical
ﬁber community (see e.g. Refs. 12, 13). The cut-oﬀ
properties and the endlessly single-mode phenomena of
PCFs can also be qualitatively understood within this
framework.[1, 7, 14, 15, 16] However, the proper choice
of the correct length scale for the V –parameter has, until
now, remained unsolved as well as the value of V ∗ that
marks the second-order cut-oﬀ. In this Letter we clar-
ify this problem and also put recent work on multi-mode
cut-oﬀ[17, 18] into the context of the V –parameter.

The tradition of parametrizing the optical properties
in terms of the V –parameter stems from analysis of the
step-index ﬁber (SIF). The SIF is characterized by the
core radius ρ, the core index nc, and the cladding index
ncl which all enter into the parameter VSIF given by

VSIF(λ) =

2πρ
λ qn2

c

− n2
cl.

(1)

Because of its inverse dependence on the wavelength λ,
this quantity is often referred to as the normalized fre-

quency. However, in a more general context, this is some-
what misleading (especially if nc and/or ncl has a strong
wavelength dependence) and in this Letter we would like
to emphasize a more physical interpretation. To do this,
we ﬁrst introduce the numerical aperture NA (or the an-
gle of divergence θ) given by

NA = sin θ = qn2

c

− n2
cl

(2)

which follows from use of Snell’s law for critical incidence
at the interface between the nc and ncl regions (see e.g.
Refs. 12, 13). Next, we introduce the free-space wave-
number k = 2π/λ and its transverse projection k⊥ =
k sin θ. The V –parameter can now simply be written as

VSIF = k⊥ρ.

(3)

From this form it is obvious why the parameter carries
information about the number of guided modes; the nat-
ural parameter describing the transverse intensity distri-
bution is nothing but k⊥ρ. Furthermore, for the second-
order cut-oﬀ wavelength λ∗ the usual value VSIF(λ∗) =
V ∗
SIF ≃ 2.405 follows naturally from the solution of the
ﬁrst zero of the Bessel function, i.e. J0(V ∗

SIF) = 0.

In general, for wave-propagation in conﬁned structures
the number k⊥ρ has a very central role. The transmis-
sion cross-section of a narrow slit[19] is an example and
counterparts of the electro-magnetic problem can also be
seen in e.g. electronic systems like the quantum-point
contact where k⊥ρ also determines the number of modes
(see e.g. Ref. 20). In the context of PCFs it is also natu-
ral to consider a V –parameter which was done already in
the seminal work by the Bath–group[1] and in the sub-
sequent work on endlessly single-mode properties[7] and

eﬀective V –values.[14] However, in attempt of adopting
Eq. (1) to PCFs one is faced with the problem of choos-
ing a value for ρ and in Refs. 7, 14 it was emphasized that
one may choose any transverse dimension. In this Letter,
we point out that the problem is not a matter of deﬁning
a core-radius, but rather one should look for the natural
length-scale of the problem; the air-hole pitch Λ. This
choice was also suggested in Ref. 7 though considered an
arbitrary choice. Regarding the second-order cut-oﬀ it
was in Refs. 14 suggested that V ∗
PCF ≈ 2.5 but it was
also concluded that the arbitrary choice of the length
scale means that the particular number for V ∗
PCF also
becomes somewhat arbitrary. In this Letter, we demon-
strate that this is not the case and that a very simple
and elegant solution exists.

To show this, we introduce the following V –parameter

for a PCF

(4)

cl(λ)

VPCF(λ) =

c(λ) − n2

2πΛ
λ qn2
where nc(λ) = cβ/ω is the “core index” associated with
the eﬀective index of the fundamental mode and similarly
ncl(λ) is the eﬀective index of the fundamental space-
ﬁlling mode in the triangular air-hole lattice. The second-
order cut-oﬀ occurs at a wavelength λ∗ where the eﬀective
transverse wavelength λ⊥ = 2π/k⊥ allows a mode with
a single node (see schematics in Fig. 1) to ﬁt into the
defect region, i.e. λ∗
⊥ ≃ 2Λ. Writing Eq. (4) in terms of
k⊥ the corresponding value of V ∗

PCF easily follows

Though this derivation may seem somewhat heuristic we
shall compare to numerical results and show that the very
central number π is indeed the correct value.

For the numerical comparison we need to calculate
both VPCF(λ) and the second-order cut-oﬀ λ∗. For
the V –parameter we use a fully-vectorial plane-wave
method[21] to calculate nc(λ) and ncl(λ) for various air-
hole diameters. For the material refractive index we use
n = 1 for the air-holes and n = 1.444 for the silica. Ig-
noring the frequency dependence of the latter, the wave
equation becomes scale-invariant [22] and all the results
to be presented can thus be scaled to the desired value
of Λ. Regarding the cut-oﬀ, one of us recently suggested
a phase diagram for the single and multi-mode operation
regimes[17] which was subsequently followed up in more
detail by Kuhlmey et al.[18] From highly accurate multi-
pole solutions of Maxwell’s equations, it was numerically
found that the single/multi-mode boundary can be ac-
counted for by the expression[18]

FIG. 2: Panel (a) shows the single/multi-mode phase dia-
gram. The solid line shows the phase-boundary of Kuhlmey
et al.[18]
[Eq. (6)] and the circles indicate solutions to
VPCF(λ∗) = π [Eqs. (4,5)]. Panel (b) shows numerical re-
sults for PCFs with varying hole diameter (d/Λ = 0.43, 0.44,
0.45, 0.475, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, and 0.70 from below). The
full lines show results for the V –parameter [Eq. (4)], the cir-
cles indicate the corresponding cut-oﬀ wavelengths [Eq. (6)],
and the dashed line shows V

∗
PCF [Eq. (5)].

Here, α ≃ 2.80 ± 0.12, γ ≃ 0.89 ± 0.02, and d∗/Λ ≃
0.406. This phase-boundary is shown by the solid line

in panel (a) of Fig. 2 and it has recently been conﬁrmed
experimentally based on cut-oﬀ measurements in various

3

PCFs.[23] For d/Λ < d∗/Λ the PCF has the remarkable
property of being so-called endlessly single-mode[7] and
for d/Λ > d∗/Λ the PCF supports a second-order mode
at wavelengths λ/Λ < λ∗/Λ and is single-mode for λ/Λ >
λ∗/Λ.

In panel (b) of Fig. 2 we show numerical results for
various values of d/Λ. The full lines show results for
the V –parameter, Eq. (4), the circles indicate the cor-
responding cut-oﬀ wavelengths, Eq. (6), and the dashed
line shows V ∗
PCF, Eq. (5). First of all we notice that
the cut-oﬀ results of Kuhlmey et al.,[18] Eq. (6), agrees
with a picture of a constant V –value V ∗
PCF below which
the PCF is single-mode. This similarity with SIFs in-
dicate that the cut-oﬀ in SIFs and PCFs rely on the
same basic physics. Furthermore, it is also seen that
the cut-oﬀ points are in excellent agreement with the
value V ∗
PCF = π, Eq. (5), and this also supports the idea

of Λ as the natural length scale for the V –parameter.
We emphasize that the extremely small deviations from
this value are within the accuracy of the coeﬃcients in
Eq. (6). In panel (a) the data-points show cut-oﬀ results
calculated from VPCF(λ∗) = π and these results are in
perfect agreement with the results of Kuhlmey et al..[18]

In conclusion we have shown that the multi-mode cut-
oﬀ in PCFs can be understood from a generalized V –
parameter and that the single-mode regime is character-
ized by VPCF < V ∗

PCF = π.

Abstract

The accuracy of calculation of spectral line shapes in one-dimensional

approximation is studied analytically in several limiting cases for ar-
bitrary collision kernel and numerically in the rigid spheres model. It
is shown that the deviation of the line proﬁle is maximal in the center
of the line in case of large perturber mass and intermediate values of
collision frequency. For moderate masses of buﬀer molecules the error
of one-dimensional approximation is found not to exceed 5%.

1 Introduction

Modern high resolution spectrometry of molecular gases requires a precise
knowledge of spectral lines shapes. The present-day experimental techniques
have reached so high precision and accuracy, that models describing line
shapes have to take into account such ﬁne eﬀects as velocity dependence of
collisional width and shift, correlation between velocity changing and phase
shifting collisions, ﬁnite impact time, and radiation relaxation. The proﬁle
of an isolated spectral line is usually obtained by solving quantum kinetic
equation for the oﬀ-diagonal element of the density matrix describing the
active gas [22]. The essence of any model describing line shapes is the way

1

it accounts for the collisions of radiator and perturber molecules. In prin-
ciple, in the impact approximation the term accounting for collisions can
be obtained by averaging the corresponding transition frequencies over ve-
locities of the buﬀer molecules, as described in [21]. The kinetic equation
is a three-dimensional integral equation. Actually, it can be reduced to a
two-dimensional, because the problem has an axial symmetry with respect
to the wave propagation direction. Due to computational diﬃculties, this
ab initio approach is rarely used for approximating experimental line shapes.
Instead, most works on this subject utilize various simpliﬁed models of colli-
sion term. The simplest of these models lead to one-dimensional equations.
They are the strong collisions [15], the weak collisions [7] and the Keilson-
Storer [9] models. The more complicated ones, such as the rigid spheres [10]
and “kangaroo” [5] models yield 3D equations.

The work [10], in which the ﬁrst attempt was made to proceed from the
simplest models to a more complicated one introduced a combined approach.
The rigid spheres collision kernel, which was analyzed in this work, leads to
a 3D integral equation. However, in order to simplify the numerical calcula-
tions, the kinetic equation was reduced to a 1D integral equation by averaging
the kernel over the transverse components of velocity with Maxwellian weight.
This reduction is equivalent to adopting the assumption that the distribu-
tion of the oﬀ-diagonal element of the density matrix over the transverse (to
the wave propagation direction) velocity components is Maxwellian. In other
words, this approximation, known as the one-dimensional model, neglects the
transfer of nonequilibrium created by the interaction with the light wave to
the distribution over the transverse velocities. Later the 1D approximation
was used in [21] and [3] to analyze general aspects of inﬂuence of collisions
on spectral line proﬁles. The 1D approximation in the rigid spheres model
was utilized in [11] to ﬁt the experimental line shapes. The line shapes in 1D
rigid spheres were comprehensively studied and compared to other models in
[23].

In our time the calculation of a line shape in the rigid spheres model can
be performed on a usual desktop computer without utilizing 1D approxima-
tion. However, it may still become useful when improvement of precision of
experimental measuring of spectral lines proﬁles will persuade researchers to
turn to even more realistic models, with kernels describing simultaneously
dephasing and velocity-changing collisions.

The investigation of precision of the 1D approximation is also motivated
by the following. It has been pointed out recently [24] that probably much

2

of the disagreement between theoretical and experimentally measured line
shapes could be removed if the calculation of dephasing term was performed
using the correct velocity distribution of the oﬀ-diagonal element of the den-
sity matrix instead of Maxwell’s distribution. The understanding of to what
extent this distribution really diﬀers from equilibrium is required to clarify
this problem. The answer to the question, how much of the non-equilibrium
is transported to the distribution over transverse velocities, could contribute
to such understanding.

The question of precision of the 1D approximation was ﬁrst studied quan-
titatively in [19].
In this article the problem was studied in the so-called
”kangaroo” model. The accuracy of the 1D approximation was found to be
good. Later the same result was extended to the accuracy of 1D approxima-
tion in describing the light induced drift eﬀect [16] in the “kangaroo” model.
This research was continued in [17] with special attention to Dicke narrowing
eﬀect and gave the same result. The overall conclusion of these three articles
regarding 1D approximation is, its accuracy is high and it can be used for
studying a wide range of problems both in linear and nonlinear spectroscopy.
This thorough analysis does not seem quite general and comprehensive. The
mere fact that the three mentioned simple models of collision integral lead
to 1D kinetic equation (and so the 1D approximation is precise for them)
shows that the accuracy of this approximation is determined by some ﬁne
properties of the collision integral. Thus the model of collision integral which
is used to study this problem should be more realistic than the degenerate
(in the sense that it has inﬁnite number of eigenvectors with zero eigenvalue)
collision kernel of the “kangaroo” model. It seems more appropriate to uti-
lize the rigid spheres model for this purpose. This model’s collision kernel is
obtained by direct averaging of the cross-section (though for a not very real-
istic potential), so it has many realistic features. Another factor that draws
attention to this model is that it is often used (in combination with other
terms accounting for collisional broadening and shifting) to ﬁt experimentally
obtained proﬁles, e.g. in [25, 14].

The goal of the present work is to study the precision and the area of ap-
plicability of the 1D approximation quantitatively in the rigid spheres model.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section the rigid spheres model
is brieﬂy described and the 1D approximation is introduced. Section 3 is de-
voted to analysis of the accuracy of 1D model in several limiting cases. The
results of numerical calculations in the rigid spheres model are presented and
discussed in Section 4. The conclusions are drawn in the last section.

2 Basic equations

2.1 The rigid spheres model

Let us brieﬂy remind the basic equations deﬁning spectral line shapes, fol-
lowing [21]. The gas interacting with radiation can be described in terms of
density matrix ˆρ(v), depending on velocity v. Let the wave’s frequency be
close to resonance with the transition between the levels m and n. Then, in
the resonance approximation, the line shape is deﬁned by the oﬀ-diagonal el-
ement ρmn(v). Below we will denote it as ρ(v) without indices. It is governed
by the following master equation:

ıω + ıkv + Γ) ρ(v, ω) = W (v) + ˆSρ(v, ω),

(1)

(

−

here ω is the detuning of the wave’s frequency from the resonance, k is
the wave vector of the light wave, W (v) is Maxwell’s distribution, Γ is the
relaxation constant, ˆS is the collision operator. The line shape is given by
the formula

I(ω) =

Re

ρ(v) d3v.

π

Z
The relaxation constant Γ is assumed to be velocity-independent. In this

case, it inﬂuences the line shape in the following way:

I(ω, Γ) =

I(ω′, 0)

Z

Γ
Γ2 + (ω

,

that is, the line shape is a convolution of the form of the line in the absence
of Γ with a Lorentzian proﬁle. Thus the relaxation tends to conceal any
details of the collision integral, including the diﬀerences between the initial
3D collision integral and its 1D analog. In this paper we consider equation (1)
only with Γ = 0, because in this case the inaccuracy of the 1D approximation
is most noticeable.

We consider the collision operator ˆS in the impact approximation and
also assume that the cross section of scattering of active molecule by buﬀer
gas molecules is independent of the molecule’s state (full phase memory).
Under these assumptions the collision integral takes the form

(2)

(3)

ˆSρ(v) =

A(v, v′)ρ(v′)dv′

ν(v)ρ(v).

(4)

Z

The function A is the collision kernel, ν is the scattering-out frequency. Ow-
ing to the assumption we made, the functions ν and A are bound by the
following relation:

It can be inferred from equations (4) and (5) that

ν(v) =

A(v′, v) dv′.

Z

dv ˆS ρ = 0

Z

for any ρ(v). Another general property of the collision integral (4) can be
derived from the detailed balancing principle:

A(v, v′)W (v′) = A(v′, v)W (v).

Taking into account the deﬁnition (5) of ν we obtain

ˆSW (v) = 0.

Below we utilize the rigid spheres (or ”billiard balls”) collision kernel
in all the calculations requiring a deﬁnite collision integral. In this model
the diﬀerential cross section of scattering is considered to be independent
of relative velocity and equal to dσ/do = a2/4, here a is the eﬀective sum
of radii of active and buﬀer molecules, and do is the element of solid angle.
The collision kernel in the rigid spheres model is obtained by averaging the
probability of a collision, changing the velocity of active molecule from v to
v′, over the velocities of buﬀer molecules. Its explicit form is [21, 10]

kernels corresponds to suppression of small angle scattering. The kernel

2.2 The one-dimensional model

Equation (1) is a two-dimensional (due to axial symmetry of the problem)
integral equation. Its direct numerical solution presents certain diﬃculties,
so various simpliﬁed models are widely used. One of such models is so-called
one-dimensional approximation. In this models the dependence of ρ(v) on
the transverse components of the velocity v is considered to be Maxwellian.
This assumption allows to write instead of (1) an equation for dependance
of ρ on the longitudinal velocity vz:

The line shape in the 1D rigid spheres model can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from its
shape in full rigid spheres model, as it is demonstrated in Fig. 2. It can be
seen on this picture, that the 1D line almost coincides with 3D in the wings
of the line, but goes considerably lower in its center. In the next section we
will analyze this diﬀerence in several limiting cases.

The essence of the 1D model is the assumption that the transfer of non-
equilibrium to the distribution of ρ over the transverse components of velocity
is negligible. Figure 3 demonstrates, that this transfer is not weak in general
case. Fig. 3 (a) represents the distribution of ρ(v), divided by Maxwellian
distribution, in absence of collisions. It can be seen that the dependence on

transverse velocity is uniform. Fig. 3 (b) represents the distribution of the
same value in presence of the collision integral. The dependence on the trans-
verse velocity becomes strongly nonuniform. Thus it could be expected that
the impact of transfer of non-equilibrium on line shapes would be also strong.
However, as it will be shown, in most cases it turns out to be numerically
small.

3 The limiting cases

3.1 The wings of spectral line proﬁle

Let us at ﬁrst consider the spectral wings of the line. Note that the calcula-
tions below take into account only rigid spheres elastic collisions and ignore
other eﬀects determining the far wings. It is convenient to turn to the time
domain for this purpose and to introduce the Fourier transform of ρ(v, ω)

ρ(v, t) =

ρ(v, ω) e−

(15)

ıωt dω
2π

.

Z

The function ρ(v, t) satisﬁes the following evolution equation:

+ ıkv

ρ(v, t) = ˆSρ(v, t) + W (v)δ(t).

(16)

∂
∂t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

This equation has only one solution that tends to zero at t
deﬁne the autocorrelation function Ψ(t) as

→ ±∞

. Let us

Ψ(t) =

ρ(v, t) dv.

(17)

This function is diﬀerent from usually used function Φ(t) [21] in the following
way: Ψ is an even function of t, while Φ is zero at negative values of t. It is
evident from (15), (16) and (17) that Ψ(t) is a real continuous even function
connected with the line shape by the Fourier transform

I(ω) =

Ψ(t)eiωtdt.

(18)

Z
The asymptote of I(ω) at ω
is determined by the discontinuities of
the derivatives of Ψ(t) at t = 0. Using (16) and taking into account (8) and

Z

Z

(6) we ﬁnd that (in the absence of Γ) the lowest order of derivative of Ψ(t)
having a jump at t = 0 is third. Thus the asymptote of I(ω) can be written
as

I(ω) =

dv kv ˆS kv W + O(1/ω6)

at ω

.

→ ±∞

(19)

In order to obtain the value of the coeﬃcient of the dominant term of this
asymptote we have to substitute the deﬁnition (4) of ˆS into Eq.(19) with some
speciﬁc kernel A(v, v′). In the 1D approximation we would have to substitute
the reduced kernel (11). It is clear that the expression in 1D case is the same
as in initial model, the only diﬀerence is the order of integration. Thus
the 1D approximation always gives correct principal term of the asymptotic
expansion of the line shape at ω
. It should be noted that if Γ is nonzero,
the tails of the line have universal Lorentzian form Γ/ (πω2) regardless of any
details of the collision integral.

→ ∞

The fact that the tails of the line proﬁle are insensitive to the transfer of
non-equilibrium to the distribution over the transverse velocities means that
the deviation of the line shape in 1D approximation manifests itself mostly
close to the center of the line. This tendency is evident, for instance, in
Fig. 2, where the diﬀerence between 1D and 3D line shapes is largest in the
center. So in the rest of this paper we will mainly analyze the behavior of
intensity in the center of the line Io = I(ω = 0).

3.2 Small collision frequency

The next limiting case we would like to consider is the case of low collision
frequency. In absence of the collision integral and relaxation the line shape
is Gaussian near the center:

I (0)(ω) =

1
√πkvT

exp

ω2
(kvT )2

−

+ O(ν).

(20)

(cid:20)
If the collision frequency is small, the line shape I(ω) can be expanded
in power series with respect to this parameter. The ﬁrst term of this series
can be symbolically written as

I (1)(ω) =

Since ˆS is a linear integral operator, the expression (21) contains inte-
grations over both initial and ﬁnal velocities. If we perform the integration

−

Z

10

only over the transverse velocities, we obtain the ﬁrst term of this expansion
corresponding to 1D collision integral. Hence it is evident that the ﬁrst terms
of the power expansion in ˆS in 1D approximation and in initial model always
coincide.

3.3 Small perturber mass β

1

≪

In this case the weak collision model is applicable. In this model the colli-
sion integral is replaced by a Fokker-Planck diﬀerential operator, and master
equation takes the form:

(cid:19)

It is obvious that in this equation variables can be separated, and thus the
assumption of 1D approximation holds true. The collision operator of the
weak collisions model is really the leading term of expansion of collision
integral in power series in small mass ratio β. In this section we are going to
analyze validity of 1D approximation in the next-to-leading order in β.

This analysis should exactly account for collision frequency ν, because it
is not supposed to be small, although it is proportional to β. For instance,
for the rigid spheres model

ν =

8√π

Nb vbT a2β (1 + β)2 .

(23)

Generally, the weak collisions model is applicable when β is small, but Nb is
large, so that ν is ﬁnite.

The term of the next-to-leading order in the collision operator is a fourth

order diﬀerential operator. For the rigid spheres it has the form

term in the spectral line shape (that is, exact in ν and of the ﬁrst order

utilizing the time domain Green’s function of equation (22). But here we are
interested only in the diﬀerence of such terms in an arbitrary model and its
1D analog. This diﬀerence can be symbolically written as

Here G(t) is the time domain Green’s function of (22), its velocity arguments
are omitted, and L1D is one-dimensional fourth order diﬀerential operator
representing one-dimensional collision operator in the considered approxi-
mation. Let us consider the expression (25) consequently. The expression
G(t′)W (depending on velocity v and time t′) is a product of Maxwellian
distribution over the transverse velocities and a non-equilibrium distribution
over the longitudinal velocity vz. According to the deﬁnition (11), the inte-
L1DG(t′)W is equal to its 3D analog

model gives correct result for the correction of the ﬁrst order in β to the
weak collisions model.

The dependance of Io on C obtained by numerical solution of (32) to-
gether with dependance (28) is presented on Fig. 4. Both functions increase
monotonously with collision frequency, approaching their linear asymptotes
(29) and (34). Comparing (29) and (34) we ﬁnd that in the Lorentz limit
the relative deviation of Io in the 1D approximation is approximately 0.2.

4 Numerical results

The diﬀerence between the rigid spheres model and 1D approximation is best
characterized by dependence of Io on the collision frequency. Before calcu-
lating this dependence we have to choose a value characterizing the collision
frequency. In the Lorentz limit we used C to characterize it. In general case,
2 /2D , where
it is customary to use the diﬀusion frequency, deﬁned as νd = vT
D is the mutual diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The value of D depends on the collision
kernel. Which kernel should we use to deﬁne D and νd? It is clear that the 1D
approximation should be compared with the rigid spheres at the same values
of physical parameters, such as Nb and a. Using its own diﬀusion coeﬃcient
for each model would break this requirement. On the other hand, using the
rigid spheres diﬀusion coeﬃcient for both models does not seem consequent.
Taking all that into account we decided to characterize collision frequency
by νd = vT /2D′, where D′ is the ﬁrst order Chapman-Enskog diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient. The calculation of D′ only accounts for longitudinal motion [13].
Thus the 1D approximation leads to correct value of D′ for any kernel. For

In order to solve equations (1) with collision kernel (9) we used a method
based on decomposition of ρ(v, ω) into a linear combination of Burnett func-
tions [12, 6]. The problem is axially symmetric, and can be reduced to two-
dimensional by turning to variables x = v/vaT , y = cos(k, v). The Burnett
functions have the form:

The desired absorbtion intensity is given by n = 0, l = 0 coeﬃcient in the
decomposition of ρ(v, ω).

For numerical solution, we need to limit the decomposition by some
l = lmax and n = nmax. The structure of emergent system of linear alge-
braic equations allows to perform the calculation considerably faster than
for a generic linear system. The matrix of the system turns out to be block
tridiagonal if we group the coeﬃcients of decomposition of ρ(v, ω) so that l
numerates blocks, and n numerates the elements within each block. Then the
blocks in the main diagonal are square symmetric matrices, and the blocks in
the neighboring diagonals are two-diagonal matrices, the blocks above and
below the main diagonal are transposed with respect to each other. The
vector in the right hand side of the system has only one non-zero element,

This system was solved by the special method for block tridiagonal ma-
trix [8]. As in the scalar marching method for a tridiagonal matrix [18], two
sequences of coeﬃcients are calculated using recurrent formulas. The diﬀer-
ence is, these coeﬃcients are not numbers but matrices and vectors. In our
case, only matrix sequence of coeﬃcients needs to be calculated because the
vector coeﬃcients are deﬁned by the right hand side and thus they are equal
to zero:

The one-dimensional problem (10) was solved numerically in a straight-
forward way by discretization of velocity. The integrals appearing in (10)
were approximated with sums by Simpson’s formula with accuracy O(1/N 4)
[18], where N is number of points. The obtained system of linear equations
was solved using Gaussian method.

The results of 3D and 1D numerical calculations are presented on Fig. 5,

The deviations are small, the corresponding scaling coeﬃcients are indicated.

proﬁles in 3D and 1D case increases with β and with νd. In agreement with
theoretical expectations, the deviation tends to zero at the wings of the line
proﬁles.

Taking into account the behavior of deviation of 1D approximation in the
limiting cases, it seems natural to expect that the relative deviation would
grow monotonously with collision frequency and with β, reaching maximum
0.2. However, this assumption proves to be wrong. Numerical
values of
calculations in the rigid spheres model show that at β < 100 the relative
deviation of 1D approximation is less than 0.1. At β < 30 the deviation is
less than 0.05.

∼

Fig. 8 presents Io(νd) obtained by numerical calculation in the rigid
spheres model and in its 1D approximation for β = 100 in comparison with
the Lorentz case. All the curves on this plot increase monotonously and
approach corresponding linear asymptotes as collision frequency tends to in-
ﬁnity. The 3D β = 100 curve is close to 3D Lorentz line at small νd. As the
collision frequency increases, it goes down and crosses the 1D line, represent-
ing both Lorentz and β = 100 case.

The behavior of the curves on this plot can be described as follows. The
Lorentz model is the limiting case of the rigid spheres model at β
. The
dependence of Io on νd in the rigid spheres model approaches that dependence
in the Lorentz limit as β goes to inﬁnity. However, this approaching is not
uniform in νd: at any ﬁxed β, no matter how large, at suﬃciently large νd the
dependence deﬂects from Lorentzian asymptote downwards and approaches
some other linear asymptote. This other (ﬁnal) asymptote goes lower than
(34), so the 3D line crosses the one corresponding to 1D approximation. It
can be said that due to this intersection of the two plots the error of 1D
approximation at reasonable values of β is much less than in Lorentz limit.
As it is known, in case of full phase memory in the limit of large collision

formula (43) does not describe the Lorentz limit itself, its asymptote is given
by (29). The derivation of (42) implies that the only distribution that is
turned to zero by the the collision operator is equilibrium distribution. The
Lorentzian collision operator is degenerate in this sense, because it turns
to zero all distributions depending only on absolute value of velocity. This
consideration shows that in case of large but ﬁnite β function Io(νd) should
behave as follows: while νd is not too large, it is close to (28). At large values
of νd the function Io(νd) must approach the asymptote (43). This is exactly
what numerical calculations show. The remaining question is, at what values
of νd does the function Io(νd) switch from (28) to (43).

d/(kvT )2

Let us consider the collision operator of the rigid spheres model. As it
is shown in [1], all its eigenvalues are positive, except the one corresponding
to equilibrium distribution, which is zero. It is clear that in case of large β
1. It means
the minimal positive eigenvalue has the order of magnitude of β−
that the coeﬃcient in O(1/νd) term in (42) is of the order β. Thus the ﬁrst
term in (42) is much greater than the second when ν2
β. So the
transition happens (and the 1D plot intersects with rigid spheres plot) at
√β kvT . This result is in good agreement with numerical calculations.
νd ≃
As it was mentioned, the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence between 3D and
1D line proﬁle is observed in case which is eﬀectively Lorentzian: 1
≪
√β. The reason of such big deviation is that at large β the
νd/(kvT )
3D rigid spheres model and 1D approximation behave diﬀerently:
in 3D
model, the kinetic energy of an active molecule almost does not change in
collisions. In contrast to that, in 1D approximation there is no such conser-
vation. This ”energy persistence” property of the 3D rigid spheres collision
kernel can be interpreted in terms of the generalization of the Keilson-Storer
model recently proposed in [4]. This model introduces two velocity persis-
tence parameters, γm and γo. They are responsible for the persistence of the
modulus of velocity and its orientation, correspondingly. The separation of
these two parameters is incident in the rigid spheres model. Indeed, in case of
heavy perturber gas, the typical change of the speed of an active molecule in
1, while its orientation changes totally.
a single collision is of the order vT β−
Thus, in case of large β the modulus persistence parameter γm is close to
unity, and the diﬀerence has the order of magnitude

γm ≈

[4] are 0.92 and 0.96 correspondingly.

5 Conclusion

We have analyzed several limiting cases for arbitrary collision kernel and
found the following. The term 1/ω4 in the asymptote of the tails of the line
shape, which is principal in absence of dephasing, is given correctly by the
1D approximation. Thus the transfer of disequilibrium distribution to the
transverse components of velocity manifests itself mostly close to the center
of the line, and the error of 1D approximation can be characterized by the
deviation of absorption in the center of the line. We demonstrated that in
case of small collision frequency the ﬁrst correction in this parameter is also
given correctly by 1D approximation.

In the limit of small perturber to radiator mass ratio β it is known that
the line shape in 1D approximation coincides with that in the initial 3D
model. We have shown that the line shape given by 1D approximation re-
mains correct also in the next order in β. In the opposite limiting case of
large β any realistic 3D collision integral conserves the kinetic energy of ac-
tive molecules. The 1D collision integral cannot reproduce such property. We
have shown that due to this diﬀerence, the most signiﬁcant deviation of 1D
line shapes is observed in case of heavy perturber molecules. The deviation
vanishes at small collision frequency, and reaches its maximal value in the
kvT . We found that in the rigid spheres model for
hydrodynamical limit ν
inﬁnite β the relative error of 1D approximation reaches the value of
20%.
The case of intermediate mass ratio was analyzed numerically in the rigid
spheres model. The inaccuracy of 1D approximation was found considerably
20%. This happens due to intersection of
smaller than expected value of
the plots describing the collision frequency dependance of intensity in the
center of the line in 1D and 3D models. For moderate values of β, that is,
β . β0 ∼
30, the relative error of 1D approximation does not exceed 0.05.
The error increases monotonously with β. At β < β0 the error takes its
maximal value in the hydrodynamical limit. At larger β the maximal error
occurs at ν

√βkvT .

PLANE WAVES WITH NEGATIVE PHASE VELOCITY IN ISOTROPIC

CHIRAL MEDIUMS

ABSTRACT: The propagation of plane waves in an isotropic chiral medium (ICM) is investi-

gated. Simple conditions are derived — in terms of the constitutive parameters of the ICM — for

the phase velocity to be directed opposite to the direction of power ﬂow. It is demonstrated that

phase velocity and power ﬂow may be oppositely directed provided that the magnetoelectric

coupling is suﬃciently strong.

Keywords: Negative phase velocity; isotropic chiral medium; negative refraction

1. INTRODUCTION

Homogeneous mediums in which plane waves propagate with phase velocity directed oppo-

site to the direction of power ﬂow are known as negative phase velocity (NPV) mediums. The

archetypal NPV medium is the lossless, isotropic, dielectric–magnetic medium, characterized

by the scalar permittivity ǫ and scalar permeability µ, with ǫ < 0 and µ < 0 being satisﬁed

simultaneously.

In the 1960’s Veselago predicted that such a medium would exhibit a range

of interesting and potentially useful electromagnetic phenomenons, such as negative refraction,

inverse Doppler shift and inverse ˘Cerenkov radiation [1]. Recent experimental observations in-

volving the microwave illumination of certain composite metamaterials are supportive Veselago’s

predictions [2]–[5] and have sparked an intensiﬁcation of interest in this area [6].

In reality, isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums are characterized by complex–valued con-

stitutive parameters ǫ and µ. Phase velocity and power ﬂow are oppositely directed in such a

ums, as has been demonstrated elsewhere for anisotropic [8, 9] and bianisotropic [10] mediums.

The present communication concerns the generalization of the NPV condition (1), within the

regime of isotropic mediums. Speciﬁcally, we consider the propagation of plane waves in the

most general linear isotropic medium, namely the isotropic chiral medium (ICM). It is shown

that the introduction of magnetoelectric coupling extends the possibilities for NPV planewave

propagation in isotropic mediums.

Our particular interest in this communication lies in the relative orientations of the phase

this matter, let us express the components of the electric ﬁeld phasor as E0 = (E0x, E0y, E0z)

and — without loss of generality — choose ˆk = ˆz. Thereby, it follows straightforwardly that

3. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Through the introduction of magnetoelectric coupling, and the associated expansion of the

constitutive parameter space, the scope for phase velocity and power ﬂow to be oppositely di-

rected is extended for isotropic mediums. In particular, it is demonstrated that if the magnitude

of the magnetoelectric constitutive parameter ξ is suﬃciently large relative to the permittivity

ǫ and permeability µ then NPV propagation is facilitated. While the parameter ξ is typically

small for naturally–occurring ICMs [12], the NPV potential for artiﬁcial ICMs, designed to

provide enhanced magnetoelectric coupling, is highlighted by the results presented herein.

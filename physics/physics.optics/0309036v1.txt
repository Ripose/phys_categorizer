Abstract

Wave catastrophes are characterized by logarithmic phase singularities.
Examples are light at the horizon of a black hole, sound in transsonic ﬂuids,
waves in accelerated frames, light in singular dielectrics and slow light close
to a zero of the group velocity. We show that the wave amplitude grows with
a half-integer power for monodirectional and symmetric wave catastrophes.

Keywords: waves at horizons, logarithmic phase singularities

Imagine light propagating away from a black hole. Suppose that the light has
been emitted immediately before the horizon. A distant observer decomposes the
light into its spectral components with frequencies ω. The wavelength of each spec-
tral component must shrink to zero close to the horizon, in order to compensate
for the inﬁnite gravitational redshift here. It turns out [1] that the wavelength is
proportional to the radial distance from the horizon. Consequently, the wavenum-
ber depends inversely on the distance and the phase diverges logarithmically. Such
rapid oscillations occur only in the direction orthogonal to the horizon, which al-
lows us to ignore all other spatial dimensions and to focus on an eﬀectively 1+1
dimensional model where we can also ignore the polarization of light. In this model
a monochromatic wave ϕ behaves like

ϕ ∼ (z − z0)iνe−iωt

(1)

near the horizon at z0 where z denotes the spatial coordinate and t the time. Note
that the behavior (1) may extend also beyond the horizon for negative z − z0 [1].
The dimensionless power iν characterizes the wave singularity. The real part of ν
gives the number of phase cycles per e-fold of z − z0 and the imaginary part of ν
describes how the amplitude grows near the horizon. For a black hole ν equals ω/α
where α denotes the gravitational acceleration at the horizon divided by the speed
of light.

Logarithmic phase singularities of the type (1) are not conﬁned to the physics
of waves near black holes. Sound waves in ﬂuids suﬀer a similar fate in transsonic
ﬂows (at sonic horizons) [2, 3, 4, 5] and so do waves in accelerated frames (Rindler
coordinates) [1], light in singular dielectrics [6] and slow light close to a zero of the
group velocity [7, 8]. We refer to a behavior of the type (1) as a wave catastrophe
[7, 8], in contrast to diﬀraction catastrophes [9, 10] that are catastrophes of light
rays in the sense of catastrophe theory [11, 12] as singularities of gradient maps.
The ray catastrophes are accompanied by characteristic wave eﬀects — interference
patterns, whereas the wave catastrophes may be responsible for characteristic quan-
tum eﬀects [7, 8, 13, 14] — spontaneous particle production [1, 15]. The spectrum
of the generated quantum radiation seems to depend on the imaginary part of the
index ν [7, 8]. All the examples of wave catastrophes studied so far correspond to

Im ν =

n ∈ Z .

In this paper we develop a simple argument showing that the property (2) is not
a coincidence for two general classes of wave catastrophes. (A) The catastrophe
aﬀects only waves propagating in one direction, such as the outgoing waves from
the horizon of a black hole where incident waves are not singular. In this case only
one non-zero ν exists at the horizon z0. (B) The catastrophe aﬀects both directions
equally. This case corresponds to two powers iν that are complex conjugate, one
describing waves propagating to the right and the other refers to waves propagating
to the left. Waves in accelerated frames [1], light in singular dielectrics [6] and
slow-light catastrophes [7, 8] belong to case (B).

Consider real scalar waves φ in 1+1 dimensions that are subject to the Principle
of Least Action. We assume that the wave equation is linear and of second order.

Consequently the most general Lagrangian for φ is
L = Aµµ′

(∂µφ)(∂µ′φ) + 2Bµφ ∂µφ + Cφ2 .

The indices refer to the time t (µ = 0) and to the spatial coordinate z (µ = 1),
the ∂µ denote partial derivatives and we employ Einstein’s summation convention.
Without loss of generality we assume that

Aµµ′

= Aµ′µ .

We express the Lagrangian as

L = Aµµ′

(5)
Since the divergence ∂µ(Bµφ2) does not inﬂuence the action and hence the equations
of motion, we can reduce the problem to a Lagrangian of the form

(∂µφ)(∂µ′φ) + φ2(C − ∂µBµ) + ∂µ(Bµφ2) .

We obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations

L = Aµµ′

(∂µφ)(∂µ′φ) − Mφ2 .

∂µAµµ′

∂µ′φ + Mφ = 0 .

We assume a stationary regime where Aµµ′
and we decompose φ into monochromatic waves ϕ with

and M may depend on z, but not on t,

∂tϕ = −iωϕ .

We get

− ω2A00 − 2iωA01∂z − iω(∂zA01) + ∂zA11∂z + M
In order to obtain a solution of the type (1) near z0, the Aµµ′
behave like

ϕ = 0 .

with the constants α, β, γ, δ. The power n must be integer, because otherwise the
Lagrangian (6) is not real for all φ. We substitute the structure (10) into the wave
equation (9) and solve for ν with the result

If the wave catastrophe aﬀects only wave propagating in one direction, like the
outgoing wave from a black hole, one of the ν is zero. Consequently, the other is
in/2 − 2βω.
In the case the catastrophe aﬀects both directions equally, β must
vanish. If ν corresponds to a wave catastrophe it must have a non-vanishing real
part. Consequently, the imaginary part of ν is n/2.

This proves our statement. At wave catastrophes, i.e. at logarithmic phase
singularities, the wave amplitudes rise with the power n/2 for monodirectional and
for symmetric catastrophes.

Few Cycle Pulse Propagation

(Dated: October 7, 2011)

We present a comprehensive framework for treating the nonlinear interaction of few-cycle pulses using an
envelope description that goes beyond the traditional SVEA method. This is applied to a range of simulations
that demonstrate how the effect of a c (2) nonlinearity differs between the many-cycle and few-cycle cases. Our
approach, which includes diffraction, dispersion, multiple ﬁelds, and a wide range of nonlinearities, builds upon
the work of Brabec and Krausz[1] and Porras[2]. No approximations are made until the ﬁnal stage when a
particular problem is considered.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of optical pulse propagation traditionally in-
volves describing a pulse in terms of a complex ﬁeld envelope,
while neglecting the underlying rapid oscillations at its carrier
frequency. The resulting “slowly varying envelope approxi-
mation” (SVEA) (see e.g. [3]), which reduces second order
differential equations to ﬁrst order, is valid when the enve-
lope encompasses many cycles of the optical ﬁeld and varies
slowly. The alternative approach is to solve Maxwell’s equa-
tions numerically (see e.g. [1, 4]), which is more general but
involves greater computational effort, and lacks the intuitive
picture of a pulse “envelope”.

For example, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) based
on aperiodically-poled lithium niobate (APPLN) have gener-
ated 53 fs idler pulses at 3µm that are nearly transform limited,
and contain only ﬁve optical cycles [5]; laser pulses with less
than three optical cycles have been generated in other contexts
[6]. Under these circumstances, the validity of the slowly-
varying envelope approximation is clearly open to question.

Brabec and Krausz [1] derived corrections to the SVEA,
which they included in their “slowly evolving wave approx-
imation” (SEWA). This enabled the few-cycle regime to be
modelled with improved accuracy, and the SEWA has subse-
quently been applied in different situations, including ultra-
short IR laser pulses in fused silica [7, 8], the ﬁlamentation of
ultra-short laser pulses in air [9], and even in microstructured
optical ﬁbres [10]. Later, Porras [2] proposed a slightly dif-
ferent “slowly evolving envelope approximation” (SEEA) that
included corrections for the transverse behavior of the ﬁeld.

Here we use a ﬁeld envelope approach to simulate the prop-
agation of ultrashort pulses in a c (2)medium. The novelty is
that we (a) derive a more general form than that of Brabec
and Krausz, called the “generalised few-cycle envelope ap-
proximation”(GFEA); and (b) apply it to both optical (non-
degenerate) parametric ampliﬁcation (NPA), and the optical
parametric oscillator (OPO). More comprehensive results, in-
cluding some for a variety of systems such as second har-

monic generation (SHG) and degenerate parametric ampliﬁ-
cation (DPA), can be seen in [11]. The only previous multiple
ﬁeld application of this kind of result was for four wave mix-
ing [12].

We compare the SEWA/SEEA equations to our own (sec-
tion II), and explain the differences and subsequent adjust-
ments to the necessary approximations. This theory enables
us to rigorously study what combination of approximations af-
fords the most efﬁcient method for treating a given nonlinear
interaction involving few-cycle pulses. Next (section III) we
discuss the c (2) nonlinearity and a scaling scheme designed
to reveal the few-cycle effects. Then we compare the SVEA
predictions to the few cycle GFEA theory using idealised sit-
uations (section IV) and more realistic OPO models (section
V). Finally, we present our conclusions (section VI).

II. THEORY

This section contains a summary of a complete rederivation
[13] of a Brabec & Krausz style theory, which yields an evolu-
tion equation for an envelope description of pulse propagation
in the few-cycle regime. Our result is more complicated than
the SEWA equation [1], but reduces to it in the appropriate
limits; it also explains the slight differences between their re-
sult and that of Porras [2].

Following Brabec-Krausz, we consider the case of small
transverse inhomogeneities of the polarization, and so start
with the three dimensional wave equation

Eqn. (11) is exact – it contains no more approximations

by recombining A and knowing the carrier. The partial deriva-
tives (ı¶
t ) in the denominators can, if necessary, be treated by
Fourier transforming into the conjugate frequency space (W
).
Note that like t , W

is scaled relative to the carrier frequency.
If we set TR = 0, this gives us a generalised few cycle enve-
lope (GFEA) equation, which contains the SVEA [3], SEWA
[1], and SEEA [2] within it as special cases. Of course we
cannot just set the TR term to zero without some justiﬁcation,
and this is discussed below.

(cid:12)

These conditions are the same as those required for the
SEWA and SEEA theories, with the SVEA conditions being
a special case gained by setting |W
| ≪ 1 for the diffraction
and nonlinearity conditions – implying that modulations in
the envelope are so slow compared to the carrier frequency
that they can be neglected. Note that backwardly propagating
behaviour has not been explicitly excluded, but since it would
appear as a modulation on the envelope A, it would be approx-
imated away as part of the evolution condition (eqn. (15)).

As a ﬁnal comment, note that the exact solution of eqn.
(11) makes no reference to a particular choice of carrier phase
y 0. This implies that once a solution for the propagation of a
particular envelope has been obtained, the problem has in fact
been solved for a set of pulses (and initial conditions) based on
different carrier phases – where that set is determined by the
initial envelope and some arbitrary choices of carrier phase
y 1 ∈ [0, 2p ). The ﬁnal state is then given by the chosen y 1
combined with the ﬁnal form of the envelope.

FIG. 1: Pump timing offset (see section III). The pump pulse is
injected into the crystal just before the signal pulse is reﬂected off
the input mirror. The faster moving signal pulse then catches the
pump pulse up about halfway through the crystal, and an idler pulse
is generated.

III. THE c (2) NONLINEAR SYSTEM

When modelling c (2) nonlinear systems we split the optical
ﬁeld into two or three parts, depending on whether a degener-
ate or non-degenerate system is being treated. For example, a
parametric ampliﬁer would have pump, signal, and idler ﬁeld
components. We then deﬁne an envelope Aa and carrier eıX
a ,
a = b
,0 for each ﬁeld component, and use a
separate propagation equation for each. The total ﬁeld is then
the sum of these different components:

,0z − w

,0t + y

E = Ep + Es + Ei
= ApeıX p + AseıX

s + A∗

i e−ıX

i + c.c.

(18)

Because the wave equation eqn. (1) is linear in the electric
ﬁeld, we can use eqn. (18) in the theory of section II, then split
the propagation equation into a separate GFEA-like equation
for each ﬁeld component in the usual way [3].

Our chosen nonlinear crystal is congruent LiNbO3, for
which we calculate refractive index and dispersion data from
the Sellmeier equations of Jundt [14]. We model the nonlin-
ear polarization using the square of the total electric ﬁeld, re-
taining the parts resonant with our ﬁeld carriers in the normal
way. Our OPO simulations (see section V) assumed a pump
frequency of 357.1 THz, with nominal signal and idler carrier
frequencies of 257.5 THz and 99.6 THz respectively (wave-
lengths 0.84000µm, 1.16500µm, 3.0110µm). This means the
pump pulse will travel through LiNbO3 more slowly than the
signal and it therefore needs to be injected into the crystal
ahead of it (see ﬁg. 1). When the two overlap, an idler is gen-
erated by the nonlinear interaction, and the three pulses then
continue to interact with each other as they propagate through
the crystal. Note that our ideal non-degenerate parametric am-
pliﬁer simulations (see section IV) use the same ﬁeld frequen-
cies, but idealise the crystal parameters by setting the group
velocities and dispersions to zero.

A. System Scalings

In a typical experiment, the crystal length would be ﬁxed,
as would any properties deﬁned by its design, such as peri-
odic poling. If we were to investigate this case for a range
of pulse durations, there would naturally be differences be-
tween the results, even within the SVEA. For example, the rel-
ative pulse broadening caused by travelling through a 1000µm
crystal is greater for a 12fs pump pulse than for a 48fs one.
Similarly, a ﬁxed timing offset for injection would have dif-
ferent effects; and a ﬁxed pump pulse power would generate
different strengths of nonlinear interaction for different pulse
lengths. All these effects would confuse any attempt at a sys-
tematic comparison of the few cycle effects in the models we
consider.

Therefore, in order to isolate speciﬁc few-cycle effects, we
must scale the pump pulse FWHM Tp, crystal length Lc,
pump pulse energy W , and pump timing offset tD
in such a
way as to ensure the effects of group velocity, pump timing,
and nonlinearity occur in the same proportions to one another
over the range of pulse lengths.

We can work out an appropriate scaling by examining a
simple version of the propagation equation (eqn.11), where
we write the group velocity prefactors as B1, the second order
dispersion prefactors as B2, and the polarization terms as CA2.
To assist us with the scaling process we also write x = r− f x
′,
t = r−gt
′, and A = rhA′, where r is the scaling factor. Our
simple propagation equation is therefore

rh+ f ¶

′A′ = rh+gB1¶

t ′ A′ + rh+2gB2¶ 2

t ′A′ + r2hCA′2.(19)

We can easily match the LHS term with the polarization
term by setting f = h; but then we must choose either h =
g to match group velocities, or f = 2g to match the second
order dispersion – we cannot match both. For our chosen OPO
situation (see section V), it is best to match the group velocity
terms, which control how long the pump and signal pulses
overlap – in general, the dispersion has a much smaller effect.
We take our reference situation to be a 20nJ 24fs FWHM
pump pulse propagating through a 500µm crystal, with a
pump timing offset of 48fs. For the chosen parameter scal-
ing ( f = g = h)

sion with B2 = r−gB′
2, the relative amount of pulse spread-
ing changes to become the same for each simulation – e.g. if
the 48fs pulse widens by 10% in a 1000µm crystal, the 12fs
will also widen by 10% in its 250µm crystal. We did a set of
SVEA simulations on this basis, and as expected saw identical
pulse proﬁles regardless of the chosen pulse length. However,
we chose not to use this perfect scheme for the bulk of our
OPO simulations because it is far from being experimentally
practical.

IV.

IDEAL PARAMETRIC INTERACTIONS

A parametric ampliﬁer is a single-pass device: pump and
signal pulses are injected into one end of the nonlinear crys-
tal, they interact within it, then exit at the far end. However,
because real nonlinear crystals (such as LiNbO3) tend to have
signiﬁcant dispersion, very short pulses quickly spread out,
making them difﬁcult to create, and reducing the few-cycle
effects we aim to study.

In order to demonstrate clearly the nature of few-cycle ef-
fects in c (2) materials, in this section we investigate an ideal
case by setting the dispersion to zero, and make the group
velocity the same at all frequencies. This means that s = 1,
so the “few-cycle” polarization prefactor K is identical for
both the SEWA and GFEA theories. Note that it is difﬁcult
to do no-dispersion simulations over long times because pulse
self-steepening causes both the numerical integration and the
theoretical approximations to break down.

We inject Gaussian pump and signal pulses at exactly the
same time (i.e. tD = 0), with the same width. They then travel
down the crystal with maximum overlap, interacting all the
way. Other parameters are ﬁxed by the scaling rules from
section III A. Further, when graphing results for the ﬁgures,
we scale the times for each pulse length to the 6fs case (e.g.
for a 24fs pulse, “t = 10” corresponds to 40fs), and scale the
pulse intensities in proportion to their initial intensities. This
means that graphs of the initial conditions for a range of pulse
lengths would be identical.

Finally, note that in these ideal results, the nonlinear inter-
action is “strong”, with signiﬁcant transfer of energy between
the ﬁelds.

duration. The proﬁles show little variation with pulse dura-
tion except for the shortest pulses (t . 20), where distortion
is evident; the signal and pump proﬁles show deviations of a

FIG. 3: NPA: Scaled GFEA idler pulse envelopes |A|2 on exit
from the ideal dispersionless crystal. The SVEA results for all pulse
lengths are essentially identical to the 96fs result.

More dramatic effects appear in the phase proﬁles:
in
ﬁg. 4, the phases of the pulse envelopes at pulse durations
of 18fs and 96fs are shown with the phase distortions due
to the ﬁnite pulse lengths (see eqn. (13)). As the pulse du-
ration shortens, the principal effect is to increase the magni-
tude of the phase distortion, leaving the shape of each proﬁle
largely unchanged; however more complex phase oscillations
develop for the shortest pulses. At 96fs, the proﬁles show
a smaller distortion, and are tending towards the long-pulse
SVEA limit. In this limit, the proﬁles are essentially ﬂat, al-
though the pump ﬁeld develops nodes which give rise to a
step-like change in the phase.

B. Non-degenerate Parametric De-ampliﬁcation (NPD)

As a variant on the case just treated, signal and idler pulses
with equal numbers of photons were injected, and the rela-
tive phases of the pulses set to ensure that the signal and idler
experience initial de-ampliﬁcation (see ﬁg. 5). Since the sub-
sequent evolution is sensitive to phase changes, and the ﬁnite
pulse length terms in the GFEA affect the phases, this is an
interesting situation to examine. In the SVEA, the signal and
idler decay away towards zero as the pulses propagate, so the
SVEA output signal is just some residual part of the input.
The GFEA evolution is different, as can be seen from eqn.
(13) – the ﬁnite pulse lengths alter the phase proﬁle of the non-
linearity, and hence change the evolution of the pulses. Dur-
ing an initial period of de-ampliﬁcation, the pulses undergo a
gradual phase distortion. Then, as the discrepancy increases,
ampliﬁcation takes over. In a comparison of SVEA and GFEA
models, the effect caused by the phase distortion is more vis-
ible when the interaction is been strong enough for the input
component of the signal pulse to be strongly depleted, and
also is much stronger for shorter pulses

The GFEA signal pulse proﬁles on exit from the crystal as

photons. Although both signal and idler will initially be de-
ampliﬁed, as they approach zero photon number, one ﬁeld will
“overshoot” the zero and be inverted. This alters the phase
relationships, and so again ampliﬁcation takes over. As an
example, simulations based on our 18fs pulses suggested that
photon number mismatches of about one percent would not
noticeably disrupt the appearance of either ﬁg. 6 or 7.

V. OPTICAL PARAMETRIC OSCILLATION (OPO)

We move on from optical parametric ampliﬁcation to a
synchronously-pumped Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO).
As shown in ﬁg. 8, we considered the case of a LiNbO3 crystal
in an optical cavity with mirrors that reﬂect the signal wave-
length only. The oscillator is driven by a train of gaussian
pump pulses whose periodicity closely matches the natural pe-
riod of the cavity, and which amplify and then sustain the sig-
nal pulse conﬁned within it. The cavity length can be “tuned”
about exact synchronisation. The idler pulse, generated when
the signal pulse interacts with each new pump pulse, is trans-
mitted through the output mirror with the pump, while the sig-
nal is strongly reﬂected. For a given set of parameter values,
we modelled the development of the signal pulse over many
cavity transits until it reached a steady state. Typically, we
found that the signal stabilised in several hundred transits al-
though, in a few cases, no equilibrium was achieved and the
system oscillated indeﬁnitely. Here we present results for the
perfectly phase matched, sychronised case.

FIG. 6: NPD: Output GFEA signal intensities for f s = p /4 and
f p = 0 for a range of pulse durations, peak value ≈ 6 × 105. Equiv-
alent SVEA results are very different: they are the same for all pulse
lengths, are too small to show up on the scale of this graph (being
∼3% of the height of the 48fs GFEA peaks), and the two peaks are
located further from the origin (at t ≈ ±10).

length and initial phase. The data for f signal = p /2 demon-
strates the effects of exact initial conditions and ﬁnite pulse
length; maximum de-ampliﬁcation occurs in the long-pulse
(SVEA) limit. If we instead start with a signal phase slightly
different from p /2, e.g. 0.51p
, the de-ampliﬁcation is less ef-
ﬁcient and will eventually be overtaken by the ampliﬁcation,
even for the SVEA model. Consequently, comparisons for im-
perfect initial phases are dependent on the length of the crys-
tal. However, since we use a scaling procedure, the results still
behave in a systematic way, even if they are not completely
generic.

Of course, changing other initial conditions can also disturb
the de-ampliﬁcation: e.g. different numbers of signal and idler

A. Scaled OPO

The complex nature of the dynamics, which arises from
repetitive cycling of the signal pulse in the presence of many
interacting processes makes the isolation and analysis of few-
cycle effects within the different models quite complicated.
Fig. 9 shows intensity proﬁles for the pump, signal, and idler
(bottom to top in each frame) for the SVEA (dashed line) and
GFEA (solid line) for four different pulse durations.

The ﬁrst point to note in ﬁg. 9 is that the SVEA results are
not identical in all frames, even though the scaling procedure
in section III A is designed to make them, as far as possible,
independent of pulse duration. The reason is that, as noted in
section III A, the dispersion scales in a different way to the

group time delay, and so is not correctly compensated by eqn.
(20).

A second rather surprising feature is that we might expect
the GFEA results to tend to the SVEA as pulse length in-
creases, but this is not evident from the graphs. The expla-
nation for this is that the steady state of the OPO can change
suddenly as the parameters are varied. This property is high-
lighted in ﬁg. 10, which shows the GFEA signal pulse proﬁle
for pulse durations from 6fs to 192fs; the sudden adjustment
of the GFEA when moving from 36fs to 48fs takes it close to
the SVEA, and the difference between the two gradually dis-
appears as the pulse duration is increased further (see Fig. 11
and [11]). Note that the scaling procedure used for ﬁg. 10 is
an extension of eqn. (20) in that the dispersion term is also
scaled, making the SVEA results completely independent of
pulse duration.

Spectral proﬁles corresponding to the temporal proﬁles of
ﬁg. 9 are shown in ﬁg. 12. The spectral shape for each ﬁeld
is similar across all pulse durations, with a pulse of double
the (time) width naturally having half the bandwidth. Notice
that the pump and signal spectra in the 6fs frame are close to
overlapping, which indicates that the separation of the total
EM ﬁeld into distinct pump, signal, and idler components is
becoming a questionable assumption.

Inclusion of the carrier wave in the results raises some
quite subtle issues that need careful consideration. It must be
stressed again that the carrier drops out of the analysis leading
to eqn. (11). The envelope description is therefore complete,
although the phases of two of the three envelope functions
can be changed by arbitrary constants without any effect on
the computations apart from an appropriate adjustment in the
phase of the third envelope. For instance, if the phases of the
pump and signal envelopes are changed by D
s, the
phase of the idler envelope is changed by D
s.
Adjustments of this kind show up in the results only if graphs
of the complete electric ﬁeld proﬁles, including the carrier
waves, are displayed, as in ﬁg. 13. If the simulations in that
ﬁgure were re-run with differing envelope phases, this would
be reﬂected in temporal displacements of the carrier-like os-
cillations beneath the envelopes.

p and D
i = D

p − D

A further interesting feature is that, while the moduli of the
pulse eneleopes may have stabilised in a simulation, the enve-
lope phases can (and usually do) change from pass to pass;
this process continues indeﬁnitely, so a movie made up of
frames from successive transits would show the pump, signal,
and idler electric ﬁeld oscillations drifting across underneath
the respective steady envelope proﬁles.

The different models discussed in this paper give signiﬁ-
cantly different results for the pass-to-pass phase drift. Fig. 14
shows the phase change for the signal pulses as a function of
pulse length for the SVEA, SEWA, and GFEA; note that the
SEWA and GFEA results are similar to each other, while the
(less accurate) SVEA exhibits a very different dependence.

The reference point used in calculating the phase drift is at
the maximum amplitude of the envelope of the signal pulse,
which is in fact not necessarily at the point of maximum elec-
tric ﬁeld. This is a good choice for our purposes because it
does not move between passes once a steady state is estab-

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a new and more complete derivation of
how the envelopes of extremely short optical pulses evolve in
nonlinear interactions. We have compared the results of our
new (GFEA) model to those of the traditional slowly varying
envelope approximation (SVEA) using a scaling procedure to
distinguish speciﬁc few-cycle effects from other phenomena
caused by changing pulse duration. It should be noted that the
SVEA becomes inadequate whenever the envelope changes
rapidly within a few carrier periods. Strictly speaking, a few-
cycle pulse is not required, because a steep edge within a
longer pulse also fulﬁls the conditions.

The effect of the extra “few-cycle” terms in the GFEA evo-

lution equation is to add a phase distortion to the nonlinear
polarization term, which then imposes itself on the pulse en-
velopes. This is demonstrated by our single-pass optical para-
metric ampliﬁer NPA model where, whilst the SVEA model
is insensitive to pulse length, the GFEA theory shows clear
changes as the pulses get shorter and contain fewer optical
cycles.

Further, when we studied the highly sensitive de-
ampliﬁcation case (i.e. NPD), we saw dramatic differences
between the SVEA and GFEA simulations even outside the
few-cycle regime. These arose from the phase distorting ef-
fects of the few-cycle terms in the theory disrupting the exact
phase relationships needed for de-ampliﬁcation. While the
absolute size of these differences do depend on the chosen pa-

rameters of crystal length, pulse energy, and so on, they will
always get dramatically larger for shorter pulses,

On the other hand, the repetitive cycling nature of the op-
tical parametric oscillator (OPO) produces more complicated
and subtle dynamics; small changes in parameter values can,
for instance, cause sudden changes in the steady state ﬁelds.
It is therefore no surprise that comparison of the results pre-
dicted by the different models is less straightforward in the
OPO case. The new model certainly produces differences in
the pulse envelopes as well as the phases, although the way in
which the GFEA tends to the SVEA in the long-pulse limit has
some interesting features. The two models also predict differ-
ent results for the pass-to-pass phase drift of OPO pulses, and
this implies signiﬁcant differences in the electric ﬁeld struc-

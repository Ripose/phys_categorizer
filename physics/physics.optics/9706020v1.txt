We investigate the eﬀects of the electron-hole spin dynam-
ics on the polarization ﬂuctuations in the light emitted from a
vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The Langevin
equations are derived based on a rate equation model includ-
ing birefringence, dichroism and two carrier density pools sep-
arately coupled to right and left circular polarization. The
results show that the carrier dynamics phase lock the polar-
ization ﬂuctuations to the laser mode. This is clearly seen in
the diﬀerence between the ﬂuctuations in ellipticity and the
ﬂuctuations in polarization direction. Separate measurements
of the polarization ﬂuctuations in ellipticity and in polariza-
tion direction can therefore provide quantitative information
on the non-linear contribution of the carrier dynamics to po-
larization stability in VCSELs.

I. INTRODUCTION

Although vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VC-
SELs) are often highly symmetric around the axis of laser
emission, practical devices usually emit linearily polar-
ized light. The investigation of the weak anisotropies
responsible for this polarization stability has been the ob-
ject of a number of recent experimental and theoretical
studies [1–6]. One of the questions raised in this search
for a better understanding of the polarization proper-
ties of VCSELs is whether it is suﬃcient to consider
the eﬀects of the optical anisotropies separately from the
carrier dynamics or whether the highly anisotropic sat-
uration of the gain in quantum well VCSELs must be
taken into account as well. This question is particular-
ily complicated because semiconductor lasers are type
B lasers and usually it is not realistic to adiabatically
eliminate the carrier dynamics from the laser equations.
The correct description of gain saturation eﬀects there-
fore requires the inclusion of carrier densities as dynami-
cal variables. A rate equation model for the polarization
dynamics of quantum well VCSELs including the spin
dynamics of the carriers was introduced in 1995 by San
Miguel and coworkers [7]. This model shows that the ef-
fects of the linear anisotropies can be greatly modiﬁed
as a result of the carrier dynamics [6].
In the case of
relaxation oscillation frequencies greater than the spin
relaxation rate the carrier dynamics can be observed as
relaxation oscillations in the ﬂuctuations of ellipticity and
of polarization direction [8]. Recent experimental results,
however, suggest that the spin relaxation rate is indeed
faster than all other timescales considered in the model.

In one study, the contributions of the carrier dynamics
have been neglected altogether since the observed polar-
ization stability could be interpreted in terms of a type A
laser model including only linear optical anisotropies [9].
A direct experimental determination of the carrier dy-
namics contribution to polarization stability would thus
be useful to test the validity of the diﬀerent models.

In this paper we therefore investigate the diﬀerent con-
tributions of the linear anisotropies to the polarization
ﬂuctuations in the case of fast spin relaxation. In section
II the rate equations are introduced and the Langevin
equations at the stable point are formulated. In section
III the Langevin equation is solved and the resulting po-
larization ﬂuctuations are presented. In section IV the
diﬀerence between the contributions of birefringence and
dichroism and the contributions of the relaxation oscil-
lation dynamics of the carriers is discussed and exper-
imental possibilities of identifying the contributions are
proposed. In section V the conclusions are presented.

II. POLARIZATION DYNAMICS OF THE SPLIT
DENSITY MODEL

A. The rate equations

In the model introduced by San Miguel [7], the carrier
density is subdivided into two carrier density pools in-
teracting only with right or left circular polarized light,
respectively. The physical justiﬁcation for this assump-
tion is the conservation of angular momentum around
the axis of symmetry. In the following equations, we will
use the parameters D for the total carrier density above
transparency and d for the diﬀerence between the carrier
density interacting with right circular polarized light and
the carrier density interacting with left circular polarized
light. n is the total number of photons in the cavity. The
polarization is described using the normalized Stokes pa-
rameters.
In terms of the complex amplitudes of the
circular polarized light ﬁeld modes E+ and E−, these
are

The relevant timescales of the laser process are given by
the rate of spontaneous emission into the laser mode, 2w
107s−1), the rate of emission into
(usually around 106
non-laser modes γ (usually around 109
1010s−1), and
the rate of emission from the cavity, 2κ (usually around
1012
1013s−1). In addition, the spin ﬂip scattering rate
γs is an important timescale for the polarization sensi-
tive interaction between the light ﬁeld and the carrier
1012s−1.
It is expected to be around 1010
densities.
In the following analysis, we will therefore consider it to
be the fastest time scale in the laser process. The case
in which γs is much smaller than 2κ such that relaxation
oscillations dominate the dynamics has been described in
[8].

−

Similar to the deﬁnition of the Stokes vector, the
anisotropies can be deﬁned as vectors. The orientation
of the vector indicates the polarization for which the re-
spective physical quantities are at a maximum. There
are three types of anisotropies:

1. the relative gain anisotropy given by g, such that
the rate of spontaneous emission into the laser
mode is 2w(1 + P

g)

·

2. the loss anisotropy l, such that the rate of photon
emission from the cavity is given by 2κ(1 + P

l)

·

3. the frequency anisotropy Ω, such that the length of
Ω is equal to the frequency diﬀerence between the
modes of orthogonal polarization.

Since we only consider small anisotropies, we will neglect
the eﬀects of gain and loss anisotropies on the total in-
tensity of the laser process by assuming that 1 + g

with s = 2κ(g
for 2κwn/γs = 0 this equation is essentially the Stokes
parameter version of the linear equation used in [9]. The
interpretation of the polarization stability in terms of a
type A laser model is possible because d can be adiabat-
ically eliminated. It should be noted, however, that the
type A model does not correctly describe the dynamics
of the ﬁeld intensity. The use of normalized Stokes pa-
rameters is therefore more appropriate. In particular, the
possibility of relaxation oscillations in the laser intensity
is not included in the equations used in [9].

The eﬀects of the split density model are given by the
terms proportional to 2κwn/γs. 2κwn is approximately
equal to the square of the relaxation oscillation frequency.
To estimate the importance of the split density model
contributions to the laser dynamics it is therefore useful
to compare the relaxation oscillation frequency with the
spin ﬂip scattering rate.

The contributions of dichroism s, birefringence Ω and
carrier dynamics χn can be recognized clearly in this ma-
trix equation. The noise term f (t) is a consequence of
the vacuum ﬂuctuations in the electromagnetic ﬁeld en-
tering the cavity and in the dipole density of the gain
medium. The magnitude of the noise terms for the
Langevin equations may be derived by considering that
photonic shot noise must be present both in the circular
polarized modes and in the linear polarized modes at 45
degrees to the polarization of the laser light.

The factor of 4κ/n is the rate 4κn at which photons enter
and leave the cavity, divided by the squared normaliza-
tion of the Stokes parameter. This is the minimum noise
term necessary to satisfy the quantum mechanical uncer-
tainty relations. Additional noise may arise from reab-
sorption of photons into the laser medium. This eﬀect
will be extremely strong in ultra low threshold lasers.
For typical VCSELs however, the minimal noise terms
should be the main contribution to f (t).

The eigenvalues λ± and the left and right eigenvectors
a± and b± of the 2

be analytically determined to obtain the linear response
of the laser to the polarization ﬂuctuations.

The eigenvalues already indicate an intensity dependent
contribution to both the frequency and the relaxation
rate of polarization ﬂuctuations. The linear response to
the polarization ﬂuctuations is then given by the Greens
function

The ﬂuctuations in the polarization of the laser light can
be determined by applying this Greens function to the

Figure 1 shows the two-time correlations as a function of
the delay time τ for a typical choice of parameters.

In addition to the quantitative changes in the relax-
ation rate and the oscillation frequency, the non-linear
contribution of the carrier dynamics introduce clear qual-
itative modiﬁcations to the polarization ﬂuctuations.
This is a consequence of the split density model in which
the ellipticity is stabilized by the carrier dynamics in ad-
dition to the dichroism. Therefore the ﬂuctuations in el-
lipticity are smaller than the ﬂuctuations in polarization
direction. Also, the phase shift between the oscillations
of ellipticity and of polarization direction is not π/2 as
one would expect for a purely linear birefringence. These
diﬀerences between a linear optical model and the split
density model may provide possibilities for experimental
investigations of the split carrier density contributions to
polarization stability.

C. Polarization noise in the emission spectrum

Because the laser ﬁeld amplitude Ek is large compared
to the noise, the two-time correlation function of the ﬁeld
amplitude polarized orthogonally to the laser mode E⊥
may be determined from the two-time correlations of the
normalized Stokes parameters. In fact, the measurement
of the Stokes parameters corresponds to a heterodyne
detection of the ﬁeld dynamics of E⊥. Consequently, the
two-time correlations of E⊥ may be obtained using

E⊥ =

P2 + iP3
2

Ek.

(12)

The measurement of the ﬂuctuations in ellipticity and
in polarization direction is therefore equivalent to a phase
sensitive measurement of the ﬂuctuations in the laser cav-
ity mode of orthogonal polarization to the lasing mode.
The diﬀerence between the in-phase ﬂuctuations cor-
responding to the polarization direction and the out-
of-phase ﬂuctuations corresponding to ellipticity corre-
sponds to a phase locking eﬀect between the emissions
into the non-lasing polarization mode and the lasing
mode.

The two-time correlation function of E⊥ also shows
some features of the phase locking. However, the infor-
mation is somewhat hidden by the summation over the
separate contributions. Neglecting the ﬂuctuations in Ek,
the two-time correlation function of E⊥ is

Note that the intensity is given in units of photon num-
ber. For small χ the total intensity of emission polarized
orthogonally to the lasing mode is 2κ, which corresponds
to 10−6W for 2κ = 1012
If the photon emis-

sion rate 2κ of the cavity is known, the minimum noise
asumption of equations (7a) and (7b) may be tested by
comparing the total intensity in the orthogonally polar-
ized mode with 2κ.

(15)

If χn/Ω is large enough the small noise peak at the op-
posite side of the laser line should be suﬃcient for a deter-
mination of χ. The fact that no such peak was observed
in [3,4,9] indicates that χn is indeed small compared to
Ω in the devices studied.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL POSSIBILITIES

A. Spectrum of light polarized orthogonally to the
lasing mode

If the carrier density dynamics is negligible for po-
larization stability the birefringence Ω is given by the
frequency diﬀerence ω0 betweeen the laser line and the
emission line of the orthogonally polarized mode and the
dichroism s is given by one half of the linewidth at half
maximum ∆ωF W HM . This is the assumption used in [9].
That the linewidths reported in that paper seem to be
larger than 2s may be a consequence of the carrier den-
sity dynamics. In particular, the linewidth with carrier
density dynamics is given by

∆ωF W HM = 2s + χn.

(16)

The frequency shift ω0 is much harder to identify. Ac-
cording to the theory the frequency should increase with
intensity until χn = 2αΩ and then decrease again un-
til overdamping occurs at χn = 2Ω(α + √α2 + 1). The
linear increase of frequency is

ω0 ≈

Ω + αχn/2.

(17)

The most important feature predicted by the split den-
sity model is the peak on the opposite side of the laser

If the frequency shift ω0, the linewidth ∆ωF W HM and
ω0) are measured it is
the intensity ratio I⊥(ω0)/I⊥(
possible to determine the contribution of the carrier den-
sity dynamics χn as well as the dichroism s and the bire-
fringence Ω at a ﬁxed laser intensity. Note that to obtain
correct quantitative results the linewidth enhancement
factor α must be known. The peak at ω = +ω0 may
be very small because of the second order dependence on
χn/Ω. For χn/Ω = 0.1 the intensity in that peak would
be 100 to 1000 times lower than that in the main peak
ω0. This corresponds to a total intensity of
at ω =
around 10−9W . This may be the reason why it has not
been observed in previous experiments. If there really is
no peak at ω = +ω0 however, it must be concluded that
the split density model is not a valid description of the
polarization dynamics in the device under consideration.

−

B. Separate measurements of the ﬂuctuations in
ellipticity and in polarization direction

While it is possible to observe the eﬀects of phase lock-
ing between the E⊥ mode and the lasing mode Ek in the
spectrum by measuring the small peak at the opposite
side of the laser peak separate measurements of the ﬂuc-
tuations in ellipticity P3 and in polarization direction P2
are more sensitive to the eﬀects of χn and reveal more
details of the phase locking. This is most clearly seen in
ﬁgures 1 and 2. At χn/Ω = 0.5 the intensity at ω = +ω0
is still very small while the features of the polarization
ﬂuctuations clearly reveal strong eﬀects of the carrier dy-
namics.

The most important indicator is the ratio of ﬂuctu-
ations in polarization direction and in ellipticity. This
ratio can even be measured at low time resolutions since
it is a constant over all times and frequencies.

Note that the α factor is responsible for the diﬀerent

This phase shift shows how the additional damping
of the ellipticity by the carrier density dynamics makes
the ellipticity ﬂuctuate less than π/2 out of phase with
the polarization direction. The frequency ω0, the relax-
ation rate s + χn/2, the ﬂuctuation ratio
P2(t)P2(t +

and the correlation phase δφ provide
/
i
all the information needed to determine the dichroism s,
the birefringence Ω, the contribution of the carrier den-
sity dynamics χn and the linewidth enhancement factor
α. Note that the time resolution necessary to measure
the dynamics of polarization ﬂuctuations in this regime
is given by the birefringence Ω. This suggests that a
time resolution of several nanoseconds may actually be
suﬃcient.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The calculations presented here clearly demonstrate
how the carrier dynamics modify the polarization ﬂuc-
tuations both in the spectrum of E⊥ and in the Stokes
parameters of ellipticity P3 and of polarization direction
P2. Even if the contribution of the carrier density dynam-
ics χn is very small compared to the birefringence Ω a
careful analysis of the experimental data on polarization
ﬂuctuations should reveal these modiﬁcations. Such an
analysis would show whether an interpretation of polar-
ization stability in terms of birefringence and dichroism
only is valid or not. If the carrier dynamics of the split
density model are relevant to the polarization stability of
a given device, the measurement of polarization ﬂuctua-
tions provides information on the optical anisotropies Ω
and s, on the spin relaxation rate γs and on the linewidth
enhancement factor α. If the non-linear contribution χ
turns out to be zero, it seems likely that valence bands
with an angular momentum other than 3/2 around the
axis perpendicular to the quantum well also contribute
to the laser process in vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers.

FIG. 1. Two-time correlations of the polarization ﬂuctu-
ations hPi(t)Pj(t + τ )i for α = 2 , s = 0.5 GHz, Ω = 4
GHz and χn = 2 GHz. (a) shows the ﬂuctuations in ellip-
ticity hP3(t)P3(t + τ )i and the ﬂuctuations in polarization
direction hP2(t)P2(t + τ )i.
(b) shows the correlations be-
tween ellipticity and polarization direction, hP2(t)P3(t + τ )i
and hP3(t)P2(t + τ )i.

FIG. 2. Spectrum I⊥(ω) of the emission polarized orthogo-
nally to the lasing mode for α = 2 , s = 0.5 GHz, Ω = 4 GHz
and χn = 2GHz. Even though χn/Ω = 0.5 the peak near +5
GHz is still very small.

The modal cut-oﬀ is investigated experimentally in a series of high quality non-linear photonic
crystal ﬁbers. We demonstrate a suitable measurement technique to determine the cut-oﬀ wave-
length and verify it by inspecting the near ﬁeld of the modes that may be excited below and above
the cut-oﬀ. We observe a double peak structure in the cut-oﬀ spectra, which is attributed to a
splitting of the higher order modes. The cut-oﬀ is measured for seven diﬀerent ﬁber geometries with
diﬀerent pitches and relative hole size, and a very good agreement with recent theoretical work is
found.

Since the invention of the photonic crystal ﬁbers[1] sev-
eral new ﬁber applications have emerged (for a recent
review we refer to Ref. 2 and references therein). Espe-
cially, the use of small-core non-linear photonic crystal
ﬁbers (NL-PCFs) for super continuum generation[3] and
other non-linear processes has attracted much attention,
both scientiﬁcally but also from an application point of
view. Most of the pioneering experiments have been car-
ried out on ﬁbers with a small silica core surrounded by
one or a few periods of large holes, and issues such as the
regularity of the hole structure and the number of guided
modes have not been considered in detail. However, with
recent improvements in the production of NL-PCFs very
large and regular holey structures are routinely achieved,
and a comparison between theory and experiment is fa-
cilitated. One of the most important properties of funda-
mental nature is the modal cut-oﬀ of NL-PCFs, and its
dependence on the pitch and hole size of the structure.
In the present Letter we report on what we believe to
be the ﬁrst systematic experimental investigation of the
modal cut-oﬀ in a series of NL-PCFs, and discuss the
results in relation to recent theoretical work.[4, 5, 6]

The ﬁbers under investigation are fabricated using the
typical PCF design with a triangular arrangement of air
holes in the cladding and one missing hole that forms the
core. All ﬁbers have been drawn from the same preform
having nine full rings of air holes and a tenth incom-
plete ring, see Fig. 1 (right). The air-hole diameter d
and air-hole pitch Λ have been determined using a cal-
ibrated high-resolution optical microscope and commer-
cially available image analysis software. Also shown in
Fig. 1 (left) is a histogram of the distribution of the rel-
ative hole sizes, d/Λ, for the four inner and nine rings in
the cladding. The four inner rings show a narrow size dis-
tribution with an average relative hole size of 0.659 and
a standard deviation of 0.024, whereas for the nine full
rings, the distribution is broadened toward smaller holes,
yielding an average of 0.627 and a standard deviation of
0.070. In the following, we will use the size distribution

since it was theoretically found, that the cut-oﬀ does not

to nine.[5] In Table I, the pitch and relative hole size are

in the ﬁber as a function of wavelength. The transmission
shows a signiﬁcant increase below the cut-oﬀ wavelength
since more modes are available to carry power. This mea-
surement principle is also used in standard ﬁber technol-
ogy (see e.g. Ref. 7), however due to the small cores and
high index steps in the NL-PCFs special care must be
taken to launch and collect light with suﬃciently high
NA to measure the contributions from all modes. In the
set-up used here, white light from a Tungsten Halogen
lamp is coupled into the ﬁber using a microscope ob-
jective (MO) with an NA of 0.9. At the output, the
emerging light is collimated using an identical MO and
focused into a multi-mode ﬁber with an MO having an
NA of 0.16. The multi-mode ﬁber is connected to an opti-
cal spectrum analyzer. The chromatic aberrations of the
lens pair at the output as well as the white light source
itself give rise to a strongly wavelength dependent power
spectrum. In order to obtain a reference spectrum, the
measurements have been performed starting with 3.0 me-
ters of ﬁber, which is then cut back to 0.5 meters keeping
the output coupling constant.

In Fig. 2 the transmission spectra are shown for the
two lengths of ﬁber #1, as well as the diﬀerence of the
spectra. Since the higher order modes are very lossy close
to cut-oﬀ, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence is expected between the
transmission on the long length and the short length of
ﬁber,[8] which is clearly seen in the spectral range be-
tween 925 nm and 1025 nm. As an alternative to using
the cutback technique, we also tried keeping the length
constant, recording the transmission spectra for diﬀerent
bending radii of the ﬁber, as prescribed in several stan-
dard ﬁber measurement procedures.[9] However, no mea-
surable diﬀerence between the spectra were observed for
radii down to less than 5 mm. Most likely this is due to
the high NA of the higher-order modes that makes them
much less sensitive to bending compared to higher-order
modes in standard ﬁbers.

of ﬁber #1. The diﬀerent panels show (a) the fundamental
mode at 635 nm, (b,c) higher-order modes at 635 nm, panel
(d) fundamental mode at 780 nm, (e,f) higher-order modes
at 780 nm, (g) fundamental mode at 987 nm, (h) the only
observed higher-order mode at 987 nm, and (i) fundamental
mode at 1550 nm.

The double peak structure of the subtracted spectra
was observed in all the ﬁbers investigated here. In order
to clarify the nature of the double peak we investigated
the spatial structure of the modes propagating in 2 me-
ters of ﬁber at 635 nm, 780 nm, and 987 nm. These
results are summarized in Fig. 3. Both at 635 nm and
780 nm it is possible to excite a fundamental mode with
a maximum in the middle of the core [panels (a) and
(d)], as well as two spatially orthogonal double-peaked
intensity proﬁles having a minimum in the middle of the
core [panels (b), (c), (e), and (f)]. However, at 987 nm
only one of the double-peaked intensity proﬁles could be
excited [panel (h)], which was observed independent of
the orientation of the polarization of the launched light.
The source at 987 nm is located in the minimum be-
tween the two peaks in Fig. 2 and hence each of the peaks
are attributed to higher-order modes [with the proﬁles in
e.g. panels (e) and (f)] having diﬀerent cut-oﬀ wave-
lengths, in this case at 1012 nm and at 970 nm. In the
ideal NL-PCF structure the ﬁrst four higher order modes
are in fact not four-fold degenerate,[10] as they are in
the weakly guiding approximation for circular step index
ﬁbers.[11] In the presence of weak asymmetry, plane wave
simulations show that the mode-indices of the four high-
order modes group two by two.
In the ﬁrst group the
modes have a spatial structure similar to panels (b,e,h)
and the two modes in the other group have a structure
corresponding to panels (c,f). Within each group we ﬁnd
that the two modes are orthogonally polarized, in agree-

ment with the experimental ﬁndings. The presence of
a small asymmetry in Fiber #1, is supported by mea-
surements of the group birefringence of the fundamental
mode at 1050 nm, yielding a value of ∆n = 1.3 × 10−4
(note that ∆n = 0 for the ideal structure[10]). With
the small pitches in the ﬁbers investigated here, only
a very small variation of the pitch or hole size around
the core may give rise to a birefringence on this order of
magnitude.[12]

All the cut-oﬀs of the ﬁbers measured here are plotted
in Fig. 4 as a function of relative hole size in units of the
normalized wavelength, λ/Λ. The solid line shows the
phenomenological relation

where α ≃ 2.80 ± 0.12 and γ ≃ 0.89 ± 0.02. This re-
lation was found to account well for numerical cut-oﬀ
simulations[5] and recently we have shown that it can also
be derived from V -parameter considerations.[6] These
predictions are in very good agreement with observed
cut-oﬀ dependence, although the experimental data gen-
erally yield a slightly lower cut-oﬀ wavelength. It should
be noted that the experimental criteria for cut-oﬀ is dif-
ferent than the criteria used in the simulations. The
measurements described here deﬁnes the cut-oﬀ as the
wavelength at which the attenuation of the higher order
modes is on the order of 1 dB/m, whereas the simulations
use the peak of the second derivative of the attenuation
to deﬁne the cut-oﬀ.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a measurement
procedure for determining the modal cut-oﬀ in NL-PCF,
which takes into account the high NA of the modes as
well as the weak sensitivity to bends. The method is
validated by inspecting the near ﬁeld of the modes that
may be excited in the ﬁber above and below cut-oﬀ. The
cut-oﬀ spectra show a double-peak structure, which is
attributed to a splitting of the higher order modes in-
duced by asymmetry in the structure, in agreement with
a high birefringence observed for the fundamental mode.
Seven diﬀerent NL-PCF designs with varying pitches and
relative hole sizes have been investigated, and very good
agreement is found with recent theoretical work on the
modal cut-oﬀ.

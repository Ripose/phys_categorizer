On total reﬂection from a half–space ﬁlled with an isotropic, homogeneous, weakly
dissipative, dielectric–magnetic medium with negative phase–velocity (NPV) charac-
teristics, it is shown here that a linearly polarized beam can experience either a nega-
tive or a positive Goos–H¨anchen shift. The sign of the shift depends on the polarization
state of the beam as well as on the signs of the real parts of the permittivity and the
permeability of the NPV medium.

1 Introduction

This communication addresses the topic of Goos–H¨anchen shifts of beams at the spec-
ularly ﬂat interface of two isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums, one of which dis-
plays negative phase–velocity (NPV) characteristics and the other displays positive
phase–velocity (PPV) characteristics. While positive phase velocities are commonly
encountered [1], negative phase velocities are permitted by the structure of the Maxwell
postulates and several instances have been recorded [2].

Negative Phase Velocity: Isotropic dielectric–magnetic materials with negative phase

velocity — i.e., phase velocity opposed in direction to the time–averaged Poynting vec-
tor — have attracted much attention of late [3]. Over three decades ago, Veselago [4]
suggested many unusual properties of materials with negative real permittivity and
negative real permeability at a certain frequency, including inverse refraction, negative
radiation pressure, and inverse Doppler effect. But his suggestion was completely spec-
ulative until a breakthrough was announced by Smith et al. [5] in 2000. Many names
have been proposed for these materials [3] — of which the most inappropriate is left–
handed material. The least ambiguous of all extant names is NPV material. Two recent
publications are recommended for ongoing developments on NPV materials [3, 6].

Goos–H¨anchen Shift: If a beam of light were to impinge on a planar interface
with an optically rarer dielectric material and total reﬂection were to occur, Newton
had conjectured that the reﬂected beam would be displaced forward by a distance d
parallel to the interface [7]; see Figure 1. Performing an ingenious experiment some
two centuries later, Goos and H¨anchen were able to prove Newton correct [8, 9]. Since
then, these shifts have been estimated as well as measured for planar interfaces between
several different pairs of homogeneous materials [10, 11]. Although Figure 1 shows a
positive shift, negative shifts are also possible [12] — without violation of causality —
as shown in Figure 2. The signiﬁcance of Goos–H¨anchen shifts has grown with the
emergence of near–ﬁeld optical microscopy and lithography [13].

The vast majority of publications on Goos–H¨anchen shifts deal with dielectric
mediums. The role of permeability appears to have been largely ignored. But per-

meability is virtually of the same status as permittivity for NPV materials.

Reversal of the signs of the real parts of both the permittivity and the permeability
of the optically rarer medium has been proved to result in the reversal of the sign (and,
therefore, the direction) of the Goos–H¨anchen shift [14]. Furthermore, if the optically
rarer medium has negative real permittivity and negative real permeability, the Goos–
H¨anchen shifts of both perpendicularly and parallel polarized beams have been shown
to be negative [15]. However, a NPV material need not have both of those constitutive
quantities as negative [16], which prompted the research reported here.

2 Theoretical preliminaries

Consider the planar interface of two homogeneous mediums labeled a and b, with re-
spective relative permittivities ǫa,b = ǫ′
a,b + iǫ′′
a,b and relative permeabilities µa,b =
µ′
a,b + iµ′′
a,b at the angular frequency ω of interest. Medium a is supposed to be nondis-
sipative (i.e., ǫ′′
a = 0), while dissipation in medium b is assumed to be very
b ≪ µ′
small (i.e., ǫ′′
b) for the sake of simplicity. The incident and the
reﬂected beams lie in medium a, and an exp(−iωt) time–dependence is implicit.

must choose Im [αb] ≥ 0, as beﬁts any passive medium.

The phase velocity vector opposes the direction of the time–averaged Poynting

vector in medium b, whenever the inequality

ﬁcient, but not necessary, requirement for the phase velocity to be negative. In other
words, both ǫ′
b do not have to be negative for the phase velocity to be negative.

3 Analysis and conclusions

When investigating Goos–H¨anchen shifts, it is best to write the reﬂection coefﬁcients
as

(cid:12)
As dissipation in medium b is assumed here to be very small, the reﬂection coefﬁcients
(cid:12)
are essentially of unit amplitude when θinc exceeds the critical angle. Artmann [17]
showed that Goos–H¨anchen shifts can then be be estimated as

more signiﬁcant effect shall be on the sign of ϕk (in contrast to ϕ⊥) and therefore on
the sign of dk. Likewise, reversal of the sign of µb would change the signs of ϕ⊥ and
d⊥. This understanding should hold also when medium b is weakly dissipative (i.e.,
b ≪ ǫ′
ǫ′′

b and µ′′

b ≪ µ′

b).

We can conclude the following: Let the medium of incidence and reﬂection be
nondissipative and of the PPV type, and the refracting medium be optically rarer as
well as of the NPV type with weak dissipation. When the conditions for total reﬂection
prevail, the Artmann expressions (6) suggest that negative Goos–H¨anchen shifts are
possible for

• only parallel–polarized beams if the real part of the permittivity of the NPV

medium is negative,

• only perpendicularly polarized beams if the real part of the permeability of the

NPV medium is negative, and

• both parallel– and perpendicularly polarized beams if the real parts of both the

permittivity and the permeability of the NPV medium are negative.

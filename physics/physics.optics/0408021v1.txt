Abstract

Propagation of electromagnetic plane waves in some directions in gravitationally
aﬀected vacuum over limited ranges of spacetime can be such that the phase veloc-
ity vector casts a negative projection on the time–averaged Poynting vector. This
conclusion suggests, inter alia, gravitationally assisted negative refraction by vacuum.

Keywords: General theory of relativity, Negative phase velocity, Poynting vector, Special
theory of relativity

1 Introduction

The discovery of (purportedly) isotropic, homogeneous, dielectric–magnetic materials that
bend electromagnetic rays the “wrong way” [1] created quite a stir in 2001 [2], with claims
and counterclaims ﬂying all around. The situation settled in 2003, with unequivocal demon-
strations by several independent groups [3]. A range of exotic and potentially useful phe-
nomenons — such as negative refraction, negative Doppler shift and inverse ˘Cerenkov radia-
tion — have been predicted for materials of this type, wherein the phase velocity is directed
in opposition to the energy velocity as quantiﬁed through the time-averaged Poynting vec-
tor. These materials have several names, including left–handed materials, negative–index
materials, and negative-phase–velocity (NPV) materials. We prefer the last term [3].

Subsequently, the possibility of NPV propagation of light and other electromagnetic waves
was established in a variety of anisotropic materials [4]–[6]. In these materials, NPV prop-
agation is indicated by the projection of the phase velocity on the time–averaged Poynting
vector being negative.

Even more interestingly, materials that do not permit the observation of NPV propaga-
tion by observers in a relatively stationary (i.e., co–moving) inertial reference frame have

been shown, after the invocation of the postulates of special theory of relativity (STR), to
allow observation of NPV propagation in other inertial frames [7]. That permits one to
envisage STR negative refraction being exploited in astronomical scenarios such as, for ex-
ample, in the remote sensing of planetary and asteroidal surfaces from space stations. Quite
possibly, space telemetry technologies will be the ﬁrst to reap the beneﬁts of STR nega-
tive refraction. Application to remotely guided, extraterrestrial mining and manufacturing
industries can also be envisioned. Furthermore, many unusual astronomical phenomenons
would be discovered and/or explained via STR negative refraction to interpret data collected
via telescopes [8].

As is well known, vacuum (i.e., matter–free space) appears the same to all inertial ob-
servers [9]. Therefore, as a co–moving observer cannot deduce the occurrence of NPV propa-
gation in vacuum, neither can any observer moving with a constant velocity. This could lead
one to believe that NPV propagation is impossible in huge expanses of interstellar space.
However, gravitational ﬁelds from nearby massive objects will certainly distort electromag-
netic propagation, which is a principal tenet of the general theory of relativity and is indeed
used nowadays in GPS systems. Our objective here is to establish that gravitationally af-
fected vacuum can support NPV propagation, at least in spacetime manifolds of limited
extent.

2 Theory

A gravitational ﬁeld curves spacetime, which eﬀect is captured through a metric gαβ.‡ Elec-
tromagnetic propagation in gravitationally–aﬀected vacuum may be described in terms of
propagation in an instantaneously responding medium in ﬂat spacetime [10], at least in
spacetime manifolds of limited extent. That is, the nonuniform metric gαβ can be locally ap-
proximated by the uniform metric ηαβ [11]. On asssuming the convention ηαβ = (+,
),
the constitutive relations of vacuum in the equivalent ﬂat spacetime are expressed in Gaus-
sian units as [10]

Our coordinate system is chosen such that the second–rank cartesian tensor γ is diagonal; i.e.,
γ = diag (γx, γy, γz). In the gravitational ﬁeld of a mass rotating with angular momentum J,
J , where R is the radial vector from the centre
the gyrotropic vector Γ is proportional to R

remote location from the centre of mass, we take Γ to be independent of R.

Here k is the wavevector, r is the position vector, ω is the angular frequency, and t denotes

An eigenvector equation for E 0 is developed as follows. By combining (5)–(8) with the

Let us consider eigenvector solutions to (14). Substitution of (18) into (14) provides

thereby, all eigenvector solutions are necessarily orthogonal to p • γ. To proceed further, let
us — without any loss of generality — choose the wavevector k to lie along z axis, and the

3 Concluding Remarks

The inequalities (38) and (39) can be satisﬁed for speciﬁc ranges of the angle θ, for given
γ and Γ. Thus, we have shown that NPV propagation in some directions is possible in
gravitationally aﬀected vacuum over limited ranges of spacetime. The possible existence of
gravitational ﬁelds which can deliver γ and Γ necessary for the satisfaction of (38) and/or
(39) is a matter for astrophysicists to discuss.

We are content here to state that, just as scientiﬁc and technological applications of STR
negative refraction (by materials) can be envisaged [7, 8], similar and diﬀerent consequences
of gravitationally assisted negative refraction by vacuum are possible. In particular, current
ideas on the distribution of mass in the as–observed universe may require signiﬁcant revision.
Finally, our work opens up research on consequences of GTR negative refraction by materials,
as well as of the removal of the restriction of ηαβ being symmetric.

Quadrate hole array is explored to study the inﬂuence of unsymmetrical periodicity on extraor-
dinary optical transmission through periodic arrays of subwavelength holes. It is found that the
transmission eﬃciency of light and the ratio between transmission eﬃciencies of horizontal and
vertical polarized light can be continuously tuned by rotating the quadrate hole array. A simple
theoretical model is also given.

The extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through
periodic arrays of subwavelength holes has attracted
much attention since it was ﬁrst reported in 1998[1]. Gen-
erally, it is believed that metal surface plays a crucial
role and the phenomenon is mediated by surface plas-
mons and there is a process of transforming photon to
surface plasmon and back to photon[2, 3, 4]. The po-
larization of the incident light determines the mode of
excited surface plasmon which is also related to the peri-
odic structure. This phenomenon can be used in various
applications, for example, sensors, opto electronic device,
etc[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Polarization properties of nanohole ar-
rays have been studied in many works[10, 11, 12]. Re-
cently, orbital angular momentum of photons were ex-
plored to investigate the spatial mode properties of sur-
face plasmon assisted transmission [13, 14]. The shape
distortion of single wavepacket during photon to plas-
mon and back to photon process was also discussed[15].
In 2002, E. Altewischer et al. [16] also showed that quan-
tum entanglement of photon pairs can be preserved when
they respectively travel through a hole array. Therefore,
the macroscopic surface plasmon polarizations, a collec-
tive excitation wave involving typically 1010 free electrons
propagating at the surface of conducting matter, have a

true quantum nature. However, the increasing use of
EOT requires further understanding of the phenomenon.
For the manipulation of light at a subwavelength scale
with periodic arrays of holes, two ingredients exist: shape
and periodicity[2, 3, 4, 17, 18, 19]. In this work, we used
a quadrate hole array to investigate the inﬂuence of un-
symmetrical periodicity on extraordinary optical trans-
mission through periodic arrays of subwavelength holes.
It was found that the optical transmission spectra were
changed when we rotated the hole array. The transmis-
sion spectra strongly depends on the rotation angle, in
other words, the angle between polarization of incident
light and axis of hole array. We also gave a simple model
to explain the results. Using this feature, we can con-
tinuously tune the transmission eﬃciency of light with
certain polarization by rotating the quadrate hole array.
The ratio between transmission eﬃciencies of horizontal
polarized and vertical polarized light can also be modi-
ﬁed.

subsequently evaporating a 3-nm titanium bonding layer
and a 135-nm gold layer onto a 0.5-mm-thick silica glass
substrate, a Electron Beam Lithography System (EBL)
is used to produce cylindrical holes (200nm diameter)
arranged as a square lattice (600nm period). The area
of the hole array is 300µm × 300µm. (b) is a quadrate
hole array. It is produced by a Focused Ion Beam Etching
system (FIB). Periods in two axes are 600nm and 540nm
respectively. The area of the hole array is 42µm × 44µm.
Transmission spectra of the hole arrays were recorded
by a Silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) single pho-
ton counter couple with a spectrograph through a ﬁber.
White light from a stabilized tungsten-halogen source
passed though a single mode ﬁber and a polarizer (only
vertical polarized light can pass), then illuminated the
sample. The hole arrays were set between two lenses of
35 mm focal length, so that the light was normally in-
cident on the hole array with a cross sectional diameter
about 20µm and covered hundreds of holes. The light
exiting from the hole array was launched into the spec-
trograph.

In our experiment, the hole arrays were rotated anti-
clockwise in the plane perpendicular to the illuminating
light, as shown in Fig.1 (c). First, we used the square
sample and recorded the transmission spectra with rota-
tion angle θ = 0o, 30o, 60o, 90o respectively. The results
were shown in Fig. 2. We can see that there is no obvious
change among the spectra of four cases.

Now we used the quadrate hole array and recorded
the transmission spectra with rotation angle θ =
0o, 15o, 30o, 45o, 60o, 75o, 90o respectively. The results
were shown in Fig. 3. Much diﬀerent from the case of
square sample, the spectra have a large change in both
the heights and the locations of peaks. For θ = 0o, the

wavelengths at two peaks are about 555nm and 700nm
with transmission eﬃciencies 1.21% and 6.30%. While
for θ = 90o, the wavelengths at two peaks are about 570
nm and 680nm with transmission eﬃciencies 1.53% and
3.99%. For other rotation angles, the heights and the
locations are located between the upper two cases. The
transmission spectra is more close to the case of θ = 90o
with increasing of θ.

To explain this phenomenon, we gave a simple model.
Since the surface plasmons were excited in the directions
of long (L) and short (S) axes of quadrate hole array,
we can suspect that this two directions are eigenmode-
directions for our sample. The polarization of illuminat-
ing light was projected into the two eigenmode-directions
to excite surface plasmons. After that, the two kinds of
surface plasmons transmitted the holes and irritated light
with transmission eﬃciencies TL and TS respectively. So
for light whose polarization had an angle θ with the L

This equation is appropriate for any wavelength. So if we
know the transmission spectra for enginmode-directions
(here L and S), we can calculate out the transmission
spectra (including the heights and locations of peaks)
for any θ. Fig.
4 gave the comparison between the
calculations (lines) and experimental results (dots) for
θ = 15o, 30o, 45o, 60o, 75o. It can be seen that the exper-
imental data ﬁt the lines well, which sustains our model.
Since the square hole array has the relation: TL = TS for
any wavelength, transmission eﬃciencies will always be
Tθ = TL = TS and the transmission spectra will not be
inﬂuenced, as shown in Fig. 2. Unlike the square hole
array, not only the transmission eﬃciencies of light, but
also the ratio of transmission eﬃciencies between vertical
and horizontal polarized light are changed when we ro-
tated the quadrate hole array. For rotation angle θ, the
ratio is

As an example, the case for 700nm wavelength light was
showed in Fig. 5. Obviously, the ratio can be varied in
a range by changing the rotation angle θ. Of course, the
polarization of transmitted light will be changed due to
this unequal transmission eﬃciencies. Our model may
also be extended to other structures, such as metal plate
with subwavelength slits. While for diﬀerent structures
and materials, the eigenmode-directions might be diﬀer-
ent.

In conclusion, quadrate hole array is explored to study
the inﬂuence of periodicity on extraordinary optical
transmission through periodic arrays of subwavelength
holes. Because of the reduced symmetry of structure,
the transmission spectra were changed when we rotated
the hole array. A simple model is given to explain this
phenomenon. Using this protocol, we can continuously
tune the transmission eﬃciency of light with certain po-
larization by rotating the quadrate hole array. The ratio
of transmission eﬃciencies between horizontal and verti-
cal polarized light can also be modiﬁed. Our results may
be useful in the further application of plasmonics.

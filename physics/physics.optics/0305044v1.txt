By using a method, previously established to calculate electromagnetic ﬁelds, we compute the
force of light upon a metallic particle. This procedure is based on both Maxwell’s Stress Tensor and
the Couple Dipole Method. With these tools, we study the force when the particle is over a ﬂat
dielectric surface. The multiple interaction of light between the particle and the surface is fully taken
into account. The wave illuminating the particle is either evanescent or propagating depending an
whether or not total internal reﬂection takes place. We analyze the behaviour of this force on either
a small or a large particle in terms of the wavelength. A remarkable result obtained for evanescent
ﬁeld illumination, is that the force on a small silver particle can be either attractive or repulsive
depending on the wavelength. This behaviour also varies as the particle becomes larger.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. COMPUTATION OF THE OPTICAL FORCES

Since the ﬁrst demonstration of particle manipulation
by the action of optical forces,1,2 optical tweezers3 and
other conﬁgurations of light beams have been established
to hold suspended particles like molecules ,4 or more re-
cently, dielectric spheres.5–7 Also, the possibilities of cre-
ating microstructures by optical binding and resonance
eﬀects have been discussed8–12 as well as the control of
particles by evanescent waves.13,14 Only a few works exist
on the interpretation, prediction and control of the opti-
cal force acting on a small particle on a plane surface. To
our knowledge, the only theoretical works dealing with
this subject are those of Refs. [15,16,17]. In Ref. [15] no
multiple interaction of the light between the particle and
the dielectric surface is considered. On the other hand,
Ref. [16] deals with a 2-D situation. Only recently in
Ref.[17] the full 3-D case with multiple scattering was
addressed for dielectric particles.

This work, extends the study of Ref.[17] to metallic
particles and, as such, this is the ﬁrst theoretical study
of light action on a metallic particle. We shall there-
fore present a rigorous procedure to evaluate the elec-
tromagnetic force in three dimensions. Further, we shall
analyze how this force depends on the wavelength, dis-
tance between the particle and the surface, angle of in-
cidence (whether the excitation is a plane propagating
or an evanescent wave), and on the excitation of plas-
mons on the sphere. We shall make use of the couple
dipole method previously employed, and whose validity
was analyzed in detail in Ref.[17].

In section II we introduce a brief outline on the method
used to compute the optical force on a particle. We also
write its expression from the dipole approximation for a
metallic sphere in presence of a surface. Then, in Sec-
tion III A we present the results and discussion obtained
in the limit of a small sphere, and in Section III B we
analyze the case of larger spheres compared to the wave-
length.

The Coupled Dipole Method (CDM) was introduced
by Purcell and Pennypacker in 1973.18 In this paper we
use this procedure together with Maxwell’s Stress Ten-
sor (MST)19 in order to compute the optical forces on a
metallic object in the presence of a surface. Since we de-
veloped this method in a previous paper,17 we shall now
It should be remarked
outline only its main features.
that all calculations next will be written in CGS units
for an object in vacuum.

The system under study is a sphere, represented by a
cubic array of N polarizable subunits, above a dielectric
ﬂat surface. The ﬁeld at each subunit can be written:

E(ri, ω) = E0(ri, ω) +

[S(ri, rj, ω)

where E0(ri, ω) is the ﬁeld at the position ri in the ab-
sence of the scattering object, T and S are the ﬁeld sus-
ceptibilities associated to the free space20 and the sur-
face,21,22 respectively. αi(ω) is the polarizability of the
ith subunit. Like in Ref. [17] we use the polarizability of
the Clausius-Mossotti relation with the radiative reaction
term given by Draine:23

where α0 holds the usual Clausius-Mossotti relation α0 =
a3(ε − 1)/(ε + 2).17,24 In a recent paper,25 we have shown
the importance to compute the optical forces taking into
account the radiative reaction term in the equation for
the polarizability of a sphere. For a metallic sphere, the
polarizability is written as α = α0(1 + (2/3)ik3

Being the object under study a small sphere located at

proximation, and hence use directly Eq. (3) with N =1.
Within the static approximation for the ﬁeld suscepti-
bility associated to the surface (SAFSAS) (that is to
say k0 = 0), we have found an analytical expression for

From Fig. 1 is easy to see that kx is always real what-
ever the angle θ, hence we can write Eqs. (4) and (6) for
metallic particles as:

izations constitutes the ﬁeld intensity at z0. The ﬁrst
term within these square brackets corresponds to the ab-
sorbing force whereas the second represents the scatter-
ing force on the sphere. We see from Eqs. (8) and (9)
that Fx always has the sign of kx. Notice that it is not
possible to write a general equation for the force along
the Z-direction, as kz will be either real or imaginary,
according to the angle of incidence.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. small particles

We ﬁrst address a small isolated silver particle with
radius a =10nm. In this case we can use the dipole ap-
proximation, hence we consider Eqs. (4)-(7) with ∆ = 0.
Fig. 2a presents the polarizability modulus (|α0|) of the
sphere. The maximum of the curve corresponds to the
plasmon resonance, i.e. when the dielectric constant is
equal to -2 in Drude’s model. Notice that, in this model
the dielectric constant is real, on using experimental val-
ues,27 the dielectric constant is complex and the reso-
nance is not exactly at ℜe(ε) = −2 but slightly shifted.
In Fig. 2b we plot the real part of the polarizability
(ℜe(α0)), and Fig. 2c shows its imaginary part (ℑm(α0)).
Fig. 2d represents the force in free space computed from
an exact Mie calculation (full line) and by the dipole
approximation from Eqs. (4)-(7) with ∆ = 0 (dashed
line) and Eq. (2) for α. In this case, the dipole approx-
imation slightly departs from Mie’s calculation between
350nm and 375nm. We can compute the polarizability
α from the ﬁrst Mie coeﬃcient a1 given by Dungey and
Bohren (DB).28 Therefore, the electric dipole polarizabil-
ity is α = 3ia1/(2k3
0).29 The symbol + in Fig.2d corre-
sponds to the DB polarizability and it is exactly coinci-
dent with the Mie calculation. When the optical constant

of the metallic sphere is close to the plasmon resonance,
the calculation from the Clausius-Mossotti relation with
the radiative reaction term, departs from the exact cal-
culation, even for a small radius. We shall next use the
polarizability of DB. Analytical calculations will always
be done with Eq. (2) to get simple expressions, and thus a
better understanding of the physics involved. The curve
of the force obtained by Mie’s calculation has exactly the
same shape as the imaginary part of the polarizability,
this is due to the fact that for a small metallic sphere the
absorbing force is larger than the scattering force.

The inset shows details of the zero force.

Next, we consider the small sphere on a dielectric plane
surface as shown by Fig. 1. Illumination takes place from
the dielectric side with θ = 0◦, hence in vacuum kz = k0
and kx = 0. Fig. 3 represents the force in the Z-direction
from Eq. (7) versus z for diﬀerent wavelengths. Far from
the surface the force tends to the Mie limit. Near the
surface the force decreases, and, depending on the wave-
length, it can become negative. For a better understand-
ing of this force we write Eq. (7) as:

Fz =

having made the approximation |α| ≈ |α0|, and D ≈ 1
since we have a small sphere compared to the wavelength
(k0a ≪ 1). The factor in front of the bracket corresponds
to the intensity of the ﬁeld at z0. The ﬁrst and the second
terms within brackets represent the interaction between
the dipole moment associated to the sphere and the in-
cident ﬁeld: the ﬁrst term is the absorbing force whereas
the second one corresponds to the scattering force, hence
these forces are always positive. The third term is due
to the interaction between the dipole and the ﬁeld ra-
diated by the dipole and reﬂected by the surface. We
can consider this term as a gradient force exerted on the
sphere due to itself via the surface. Hence, this force
is always negative whatever the relative permittivity ε.
Since this term is proportional to 1/z4
0, it becomes more
dominant as the sphere approaches the surface, hence the
force decreases. To derive the point z0 at which the force
vanishes, if such a point exists, let us assume the scat-
tering force smaller than the absorbing force, then from
Eq. (10) the zero force is:

z4
0 =

3|α0|2
16k0ℑm(α0)

ǫ − 1
ǫ + 2

.

(11)

This equation always has a solution. We ﬁnd z0 for the
three wavelengths used to be: λ = 270nm, z0 = 7.9nm,
λ = 360nm, z0 = 12.8nm, λ = 500nm, z0 = 21.6nm.
Now, z0 (the location of the center of the sphere) must
be larger than the radius a, or else, the sphere would be
buried in the surface. Therefore the ﬁrst of those values
of z0 is not possible. Hence, the force is always positive.
Thus, the distance between the sphere and the surface is
z=2.8nm and 11.6nm for λ =360nm and 500nm, respec-
tively. These values are very close to those shown in the
inset of Fig. 2. Notice that near the plasmon resonance
for the sphere (λ ≈ 360nm) both |α0| and ℑm(α0) are
maxima, hence the force is very large when the sphere
is far from the surface and, due to the third term of
Eq. (10), which depends of |α0|2, the decay of this force
is very fast. We have used the static approximation for

3

the susceptibility tensor associated to the surface (SAF-
SAS) at large distance. We plot in Fig. 2 with crosses the
force obtained from an exact calculation for S with the
dipole approximation. As we see, these crosses coincide
with those curves obtained with the SAFSAS whatever
the distance z. Yet, we obtain for dielectric spheres the
following: near the surface the SAFSAS is valid, whereas
far from the surface the sphere does not feel its presence,
and, thus, whether using the tensor susceptibility associ-
ated to the surface in its exact form, or within the static
approximation, has no inﬂuence.

with a = 10nm versus the wavelenght λ in the dipole ap-

We next consider the surface illuminated at angle of
incidence θ larger than the critical angle: θ = 50◦ >

4

41.8◦ = θc. Now the transmitted electromagnetic wave
above the surface is evanescent. We plot in Fig. 4 from
Eqs. (4)-(7) the force on the sphere for the two polar-
izations in the Z-direction versus the wavelength, and
in the X-direction in Fig. 5, when the sphere is located
at z0=30nm. In Fig. 4 we see that the force in the Z-
direction is also either positive or negative. In a previous
work17, we have observed that the force on a small dielec-
tric sphere is always attractive when the sphere is located
in an evanescent wave. This is no longer the case for a
metallic sphere. To understand this diﬀerence, and as
the two polarizations have the same behaviour, we take
the analytical solution for Fz with kz = iγ (γ > 0) for
s-polarization. Then Eq. (7) can be written:

As shown by Fig. 3, when the sphere is located at
z0 =30nm, the inﬂuence of the surface becomes negli-
gible, thus we can use Eq. (13) with the hypothesis that
z0 is large. Hence, Fz ≈ −|E0y|2γℜe(α0)/2. This is
the gradient force due to the incident ﬁeld, and there-
fore due to the interaction between the dipole associated
to the sphere and the applied ﬁeld. This force exactly
follows the behaviour of ℜe(α0) (cf. Fig. 2). When
ℜe(α0) is negative, the dipole moment of the sphere
oscillates in opposition to the applied ﬁeld and so the
sphere is attracted towards the weaker ﬁeld. Notice that
the same phenomenon is used to build an atomic mir-
ror: for frequencies of oscillation higher than the atomic
frequency of resonance, the induced dipole oscillates in
phase opposition with respect to the ﬁeld. The atom
then undergoes a force directed towards the region of
weaker ﬁeld.30 For p-polarization, the force can be writ-
ten Fz ≈ −(|E0x|2 + |E0z|2)γℜe(α0)/2. As the modulus
of the ﬁeld becomes more predominant in p-polarization,
the magnitude of the force becomes more important. We
now search more carefully the change of sign in the force.
Writing ε = ε′ + iε′′ for the relative permittivity, we get:

ℜe(α0) = a3 (ε′ − 1)(ε′ + 2) + ε′′2

(ε′ + 2)2 + ε′′2

ℑm(α0) = a3

3ε′′
(ε′ + 2)2 + ε′′2

(14)

(15)

If the damping is weak, then the change of sign of Fz
happens both for ε′ ≈ 1 and at the plasmon resonance
for the sphere, i.e., ε′ ≈ −2. Between these two values,
the gradient force is positive. In fact, the limiting val-
ues of the positive gradient force are always strictly in

the interval [−2, 1] due to damping. For example, the
force vanishes at λ = 352nm with ε = −1.91 + 0.6i and
λ = 317nm with ε = 0.66 + 0.95i. We notice that the
change of sign happens steeply at the plasmon resonance
since then the denominator of the real part of the po-
larizability becomes very weak (see Eq. (14)), hence the
zero force is surrounded by the two maxima of the force
(one positive and the other negative). At λ = 317nm
the change of sign is smoother as in that case the de-
nominator is far from zero. The third case, λ = 259nm,
lies between those two previous cases as the damping of
the relative permittivity is important: ε = −1.65 + 1.12i.
We have also investigated the cases of gold and copper
spheres, where a plasmon easily takes place, but we found
not possible change of sign for Fz for these two materials
as the damping is then too important: if ε′′ > 3/2, then
ℜe(α0) is always positive whatever ε′. However, if the
particle is embedded in a liquid with a relative permit-
tivity 2, then it is possible to get ℜe(α) < 0 for gold.
Notice that if θ is close to θc, then γ ≈ 0 and so we only
have the third term of Eq. (13), then the force is always
negative whatever the wavelength. In Fig. 5 we see, as
previously, that the force in the X-direction has the sign
of kx and, as the absorbing force is the most predomi-
nant one, the curve has the same shape as the imaginary
part of the polarizability (cf. Fig. 2). In that case, the
maximum of the force Fx is at the plasmon resonance
(see Eq. (15)) namely at λ = 354nm.

that near the surface the force is attractive, this is due,
as seen before with a propagating wave, to the term of
∆/z4
0 in Eqs. (10) and (13) which is always negative,
irrespective of the kind of wave above the surface. At
λ =317.5nm ,(dotted line), we have ℜe(α) = 0 which is
why the force very quickly goes to zero when z grows. The
two other cases correspond to ℜe(α) > 0 (λ =260nm) and
ℜe(α) < 0 (λ =340nm) and far from the surface the force
tends to zero. As the force is proportional to |E0|2, we
have Fz ∝ e(−2γz).

B. large particles

It is diﬃcult to obtain convergence for the CDM when
the relative permittivity of the medium to discretize is
large. This imposes a very ﬁne sampling. In this section,
we use the range 250-355nm for the wavelength, the real
part of the relative permittivity being small. Then, the
computation is simpliﬁed. In addition, this is the most
interesting case as then ℜe(α) = 0 three times in this
interval of wavelengths.

puted points.

In Fig. 7 we plot the force in the Z-direction for an in-
cident propagating wave (θ = 0◦) versus the distance be-
tween the sphere and the surface at three diﬀerent wave-
lengths: λ =255nm, 300nm, 340nm. The calculations are
done without any approximation. The curves have a sim-
ilar magnitude and behaviour at the three wavelengths.
The forces present oscillations due to the multiple reﬂec-
tion of the radiative waves between the sphere and the
surface, hence the period of these oscillations is λ/2. The
magnitude of these oscillations depends on the reﬂectiv-
ity of the sphere, so the higher the Fresnel coeﬃcient is,
the longer these oscillations are. As expected, they are

both polarizations, only appearing a diﬀerence of magni-

less remarkable when the sphere goes far from the surface.
We notice that the decay of the force when the metallic
sphere gets close to the surface is not comparable to that
on a dielectric sphere (see Ref.[17]). This is due to strong
absorbing and scattering forces on the metallic sphere in
comparison to the gradient force induced by the presence
of the dielectric plane.

observe the same behaviour as in the previous section for
an incident evanescent wave, namely at λ = 255nm and
340nm, the force in the Z-direction is positive, and it
becomes negative for λ = 300nm for both polarizations.
These curves show a dependence proportional to the cube
of the radius as ℜ(α0) ∝ a3. At the plasmon resonance,
the force is slightly positive as there is no gradient force,
but only weak absorbing and scattering forces.

wavelengths: λ = 255nm (plain line), λ = 300nm (dashed
line), and λ = 340nm (dotted line). symbol +: s-polarization;
without symbol: p-polarization.

In Fig. 8 we plot for θ = 50◦ the normalized force
in the Z-direction, i.e., Fz/|E0|2, E0 being the ﬁeld at
z0 in the absence of the sphere. We remark two im-
portant facts at this angle of incidence. First, the de-
cay of the force when the sphere is near the surface is
more important in p-polarization. Notice that with the
CDM it is not possible to numerically split the scatter-
ing, absorbing, and gradient forces. Therefore, when the
sphere is large we shall argument on the set of dipoles
forming it.
In p-polarization, due to the z-component
of the incident ﬁeld, the dipoles also have a component
perpendicular to the surface, and this is larger than in
s-polarization. Hence, in agreement with Fig. 6, due to
this z-component, the attraction of the sphere towards
the surface is larger for p-polarization. Second, all forces
are positive when the sphere is far from the surface ex-
cept for λ =300nm in p-polarization. At this wavelength,
for a small sphere, the force is negative for both s and
p-polarization, hence we can assume an eﬀect due to the
size of the sphere. Just to see this eﬀect, we present in
Fig. 9 the force in the Z-direction versus the radius a, on
a sphere located at z0 = 100nm for an angle of incidence
θ = 50◦ but without taking into account the multiple
interaction with the surface (i.e., S = 0). We take the
previous wavelength of Fig. 8 (λ = 255nm, 300nm, and
340nm) more the wavelength at the plasmon resonance,
λ = 351.5nm where ℜ(α0) = 0. For small radius, we

(dotted line), and λ = 351.5nm (thick line). Symbol +:
s-polarization; without symbol: p-polarization. The inter-
action between the sphere and the surface is not taken into
account.

But as shown by Fig. 9, when the radius grows, in s-
polarization at λ =300nm, the force sign changes and
it becomes positive around 82nm as p-polarization keep
the same behaviour. This conﬁrms the fact that the pos-
itive force obtained in Fig. 8 for λ =300nm is only a size
eﬀect. For the cases λ = 255nm, 340nm, the gradient
force is positive in the Z-direction, like the scattering
and absorbing forces . Hence, the force, is always posi-
tive whatever the radius. Nevertheless, for λ = 300nm,
these is a negative gradient force, the two other forces
being positive. As previously said, it is not possible to
know the relative contribution of the diﬀerent forces, but
in s-polarization the dipoles have a component mainly
parallel to the plane. In that case, the dipole associated
to each subunit radiates a ﬁeld both propagating and
evanescent along the Z-direction. Hence, we can assume
that due to the radiative part, the absorbing and scatter-
ing forces acting on the subunits inside the sphere, be-
come important when the radius increases. Concerning
p-polarization, due to the component of the ﬁeld perpen-
dicular to the plane, the dipoles have a component along
Z and thus only radiate evanescent waves along this di-
rection. In this case, we believe that the gradient force
is more important on each subunit and counterbalances

the absorbing and scattering forces. At plasmon reso-
nance λ = 351.5nm, when the radius grows, the absorb-
ing and scattering forces become larger, but as no gra-
dient force exists, the force is lower than those obtained
at λ = 255nm and 340nm. In fact, the curve shown at
λ = 340nm is the most important one, due to the onset
of the plasmon resonance, thus |α0| and ℑm(α0) being
near their maximum, and ℜe(α0) close to its minimum.
In this case, the gradient force is maximum and positive.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a theoretical study of the optical
forces acting upon a metallic particle on a dielectric plane
surface either illuminated at normal incidence or under
total internal reﬂection. This study is done both with the
coupled dipole method and Maxwell’s stress tensor. We
observe that when the incident wave is propagating, the
diﬀerence between the force acting on a dielectric sphere
and that on a metallic sphere stems from the absorbing
force. Due to this contribution, the force upon a small
silver sphere close to the dielectric surface can be posi-
tive in spite of the gradient force. The opposite happens
with a dielectric sphere. The main diﬀerence between
the two cases (dielectric and metallic) arises however on
illumination under total internal reﬂection. In that case,
the eﬀect on a small silver sphere is completely diﬀerent
to that observed on a dielectric sphere. Depending on
the wavelength, the gradient force due to the incident
ﬁeld can be either repulsive or attractive. The change of
sign happens both at the plasmon resonance and when

two values the gradient force is positive. The explana-
tion is very similar to that on the eﬀect used to build
an atomic mirror. At a wavelength where the gradient
force on a small sphere is negative, we see that when
the sphere radius grows, the force along the Z-direction
stays negative for p-polarization, and it becomes positive
for s-polarization due to the size eﬀect. Nevertheless, at
any arbitrary wavelength and angle of incidence, as the
sphere approaches close to the surface, the attraction of
the surface on the sphere increases: repulsive forces di-
minish and even can change sign, eventually becoming
attractive at certain wavelengths. Attractive forces, on
the other hand, increase their magnitude.

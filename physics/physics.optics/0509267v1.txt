The standard model predicts the dipole moment of the electron at a level of about 10−

the supersymmetry is an important ingredient of modern physics it would be desirable
to achieve the sensitivity of measurements enabling us to test these predictions. Present
limit on the electron EDM is de < 1.6

27 [4].
Measurement of an angle of the polarization plane rotation of light when it
propagates through a gas immersed in an electric ﬁeld is one of the possible ways to
search for the electric dipole moment of an electron. Interaction of an electric ﬁeld with
the electron dipole moment leads to the splitting of the atomic levels, analogous to the
Zeeman eﬀect and, consequently, to polarization plane rotation (similar Faraday eﬀect)
when a photon propagates along the electric ﬁeld direction.

×

×

It was shown in [7, 8, 9] that in addition to the atomic level splitting one more
mechanism leading to light polarization plane rotation exists. It is the interference of
the Stark and P-T- induced transition amplitudes.

In a typical transmittance experiment with a cell (Fig. 1a) the intensity of a light
beam decreases when it propagates in a medium. This restricts the length available for
polarization plane rotation measurements [10]. An idea to use a photon trap (resonator)
with an ampliﬁer (Fig 1b, 1c) to compensate light absorption was proposed in [9].
Because of the trap contains exited medium the ampliﬁcation cancels the losses and
light can stay in the resonator for a long time.

Below we give a detailed theoretical analysis of the photon trap with an ampliﬁer
for measurements of the P-T- noninvariance. The simplest trap is a laser placed in the
electric ﬁeld (Fig. 1b). This system is similar to the laser in the magnetic ﬁeld considered
in 70th [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and recently as a footing of the laser magnetometers [16, 17].
The main diﬃculty for laser magnetometery is linear anisotropy of losses of the
resonator [16, 17]. The same diﬃculty is deferred on the measurements of P-T-
noninvariant rotation in the electric ﬁeld, because the linear anisotropy of resonator is
much greater than the circular anisotropy created by the electric ﬁeld provided that P-
and T- invariance breakes. Under these circumstances there is no polarization plane
rotation with the constant angular velocity. When the electric ﬁeld turns on, the
polarization plane rotates for a small angle and then stops. Just this angle should
be measured.

2. The angle of polarization plane rotation in the electric ﬁeld

Let us consider a stationary electromagnetic wave in a resonator containing an exited
medium possessing linear and circular anisotropy. The eﬀect of polarization plane
rotation can be described by the P- T- noninvariant term nij
k in the tensor
of the refractive index of the medium [5, 6], where eijk is the completely antisymmetric
tensor and E is the external electric ﬁeld. Let the mirrors of the resonator are

P T ∼

perpendicular to the z-axis, and the external electric ﬁeld E is directed along it.

It is convenient to choose the reference frame providing for the matrix of anisotropic
losses of the resonator to be diagonal. Thus the tensor part of the generalized refractive
index (see Appendix), which includes the resonator, has the form:

Measurements should be performed by the analyzer placed perpendicularly to the
polarization plane of the laser beam (when the electric ﬁeld is turned oﬀ). Orientation
of the polarization plane of the laser light is determined by residual anisotropy of losses
it is directed along the
in the resonator and coincides with one of the main axes i.e.
vector h =

χ, 0, 0

.

As the electric ﬁeld is turned on, the circular anisotropy a depending linearly on
the electric ﬁeld appears and the polarization plane rotates by the angle φlas, which
can be found from the Eq. (27) given in appendix. This equation describes stationary
polarization of light. The angle φlas is the half of the angle between vector O at a = 0,
when there is no electric ﬁeld and that at some a produced by the tuned on electric
χ. Vectors h and r in (27) are

2χ2 appears. However, this
angle can not depend linearly on the electric ﬁeld. One more additional angle (so-called
”base angle” [10]) arises due to inexact perpendicular orientation of the analyzer with
respect to the polarization plane of the laser beam.

The conventional experimental method implies modulation of the ”base angle” with
the frequency Ω by the additional Faraday element placed between laser and analyzer.
The signal at the output of analyzer is proportional to the squared sum of the P-T-
violating angle of rotation and the ”base angle”. Presence of Ω component in the
Fourier transform of the output signal is the signature of P-, T- invariance violation.

3. Estimates for the ”trap” and ”transmittance” layouts

Let us estimate the advantage of the laser experiment (Fig. 1b) compared to the light
transmission experiment using a cell (Fig. 1a).

The P-, T- violating refractive index does not depend on the type of the atomic
transition, i.e. it is approximately the same for the dipole electric, magnetic and strongly

5

(8)

forbidden magnetic transitions [8].
In the transmittance experiments with a cell the
angle of rotation is usually measured for two absorption lengths, thus it is reasonable to
choose transitions with the greatest absorption length. These are magnetic dipole and
strongly forbidden magnetic transitions. The angle of polarization plane rotation in a
cell for the length L is equal to (see [7, 8, 9, 10]):

where k is the wave number. As we have mentioned, ∆nP T in the equation (5) diﬀers
from ∆n′P T in the expression (4). The ﬁrst quantity corresponds to a medium in the
ground state and transitions happen from the ground level to the exited one whereas,
in the case of the laser medium, the transitions happen from a top level to the bottom.
These quantities are connected to each other by the relation

where N is the concentration of atoms, and ∆N is the density of inversely populated
atoms. Substituting ∆n′P T from (6) to the equation (4) one obtaines:

where σ is the absorption cross section for this transition. From the equations (7) and
(5) we can see that the angle of polarization rotation in the laser is equal to the angle
of rotation at the absorption length Labs = 1
∆Q. Thus one expect to
obtain 2Q
106 enhancement in comparison with a layout, using a cell. Let us remind
that the experiment with a cell uses the strongly forbidden transition, therefore the real
gain will only appear if the laser also operates at transitions of this type. In the laser
operating at ordinary electric dipole transitions, a very low inversion of population is
required to compensate absorptions in the resonator, because σ in (8) is large. The
real part of the refraction index is also proportional to the inversion of population and
additional suppression given by (6) arises. Thus, the most of the gas lasers, using E1
transitions are unsuitable as a trap for measuring P-T- violation. Although there are no
lasers working at a strongly forbidden magnetic transition, lasers working at a magnetic
dipole transitions do exist. One of such examples is the chemical atomic iodine gas laser
that uses 2P3/2 →

2 P1/2 transition [18, 19].

The P- T- odd refractive index can be expressed in terms of the P- T-odd

polarizability βP T of iodine the atom:

∆nP T =

2πNβP T .

Two mechanisms contributing to βP T were considered in [7, 8, 9]. The ﬁrst one is the
interference of Stark and P-T- odd transition amplitudes. The value of βP T in this case
can be estimated as:

Sources of P- T- violation are the electron EDM, EDM of the nucleons, and the

The matrix element of P-T- odd interaction between atomic states can be estimated

Z 2α2 [10], where υ is the typical electron velocity in atom, Z is the atomic
number. However, the Shiﬀ theorem does not concern the ”mixing” mechanism, because
an atom EDM does not appear in it. Thus we have to use two diﬀerent < HT > to
describe ”mixing” and ”splitting” mechanisms. Unfortunately, in Ref. [8] we used the

5. Appendix

One can obtain condition for stationary oscillation in a resonator supposing that the
amplitude of the running wave after light travels back and forth in the resonator is
equal to the initial amplitude. If, for example, the resonator is ﬁlled with a medium
with a constant refractive index n then the amplitude of a running wave departed from
some point near the mirror (Fig. 1b) and returned to the original point will be equal to
2iknLE0, where k is the wave number of the wave in vacuum, L is the length of
E = e−
the resonator. Since the initial and ﬁnal amplitudes are equal to each other, knL = m π,
where m is an integer number. Diﬀerence of the refractive index from that given by the
2i∆n k L E after the
above condition by ∆n results in change of the amplitude ∆E =

This equation may be derived also in a less heuristic way [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Losses
corresponding to the reﬂectance of the resonator mirrors can be “smeared out” over the

Nonlinear properties of the laser medium results in dependence of the factors h0,

However, it is possible to neglect dependence of intensity ξ0 on time in factors h0, rz,
hz. Thus nonlinearity will result in renormalization of these factors.

One more manifestation of nonlinearity is so-called ”self-rotation” [14] resulting in

possibility of dependence:

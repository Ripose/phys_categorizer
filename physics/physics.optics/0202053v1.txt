We elaborate on the consequences of the factorization of the transfer matrix of any lossless mul-
tilayer in terms of three basic matrices of simple interpretation. By considering the bilinear trans-
formation that this transfer matrix induces in the complex plane, we introduce the concept of
multilayer transfer function and study its properties in the unit disk. In this geometrical setting,
our factorization translates into three actions that can be viewed as the basic pieces for understand-
ing the multilayer behavior. Additionally, we introduce a simple trace criterion that allows us to
classify multilayers in three types with properties closely related to one (and only one) of these
three basic matrices. We apply this approach to analyze some practical examples that are typical
representatives of these types of matrices.

INTRODUCTION

Layered media play an important role in many appli-
cations in modern optics, especially in relation to optical
ﬁlters and the like. Therefore, it is not surprising that
the topics covered in most of the textbooks on the subject
use a mixture of design, manufacture, and applications;
dealing only with the basic physics needed to carry out
practical computations [1].

However, for a variety of reasons, layered media have
physical relevance on their own [2, 3]. As any linear sys-
tem with two input and two output channels, any multi-
2 transfer matrix.
layer can be described in terms of a 2
In fact, it has been recently established that for a lossless
multilayer this transfer matrix is an element of the group
SU(1,1) [4, 5]. From this perspective, it is precisely the
abstract composition law of SU(1,1) the ultimate respon-
sible for the curious composition law of the reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients [6, 7].

×

This purely algebraic result is certainly remarkable.
But, as soon as one realizes that SU(1,1) is also the ba-
sic group of the hyperbolic geometry [8], it is tempting
to look for an enriching geometrical interpretation of the
multilayer action. Moreover, given the role played by ge-
ometrical ideas in all branches of physics, particularly in
special relativity, it is easy to convince oneself that this
approach might provide deeper insights into the behavior
of a multilayer in a wider unifying framework that can
put forward fruitful analogies with other physical phe-
nomena.

Accordingly, we have proposed [9] to view the action
of any lossless multilayer as a bilinear transformation
on the unit disk, obtained by stereographic projection
of the unit hyperboloid of SU(1,1). This kind of bilin-
ear representations have been discussed in detail for the
Poincar´e sphere in polarization optics [10, 11], for Gaus-
sian beam propagation [12], and are also useful in laser
mode-locking and optical pulse transmission [13].

In spite of these achievements, the action of an ar-
bitrary lossless stack could still become cumbersome to
interpret in physical terms. In fact, in practice it is usual
to work directly with the numerical values of a matrix
obtained from the experiment, which cannot be directly
related to the inner multilayer structure. To remedy this
situation, we have resorted recently [14] to the Iwasawa
decomposition, which provides a remarkable factoriza-
tion of the matrix representing any multilayer (no mat-
ter how complicated it could be) as the product of three
matrices of simple interpretation.

At the geometrical level, such a decomposition trans-
lates directly into the classiﬁcation of three basic actions
in the unit disk, which are studied in this paper, that
can be considered as the basic bricks for understanding
multilayers. Moreover, we have also shown [15] that the
trace of the transfer matrix allows for a classiﬁcation of
multilayers in three diﬀerent types with properties very
close to those appearing in the Iwasawa decomposition.

In this paper we go one step further and exploit this
new classiﬁcation to study several practical examples
that are representatives of each type. This shows the
power of the method and, at the same time, allows for
a deeper understanding of layered media. As a direct
application, we treat the outstanding case of symmetric
multilayers, ﬁnding a precise criterion for zero-reﬂectance
conditions. Nevertheless, we stress that the beneﬁt of
this formulation lies not in any inherent advantage in
terms of eﬃciency in solving problems in layered struc-
tures. Rather, we expect that the formalism presented
here could provide a general and unifying tool to an-
alyze multilayer performance in an elegant and concise
way that, additionally, is closely related to other ﬁelds of
physics, which seems to be more than a curiosity.

II. TRANSFER MATRIX FOR A LOSSLESS
MULTILAYER

We ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the essential ingredients of
multilayer optics we shall need for our purposes [10].
The conﬁguration is a stratiﬁed structure, illustrated in
Fig. 1, that consists of a stack of 1, . . . , j, . . . , m, plane–
parallel
lossless layers sandwiched between two semi-
inﬁnite ambient (a) and substrate (s) media, which we
shall assume to be identical, since this is the common
experimental case. Hereafter all the media are supposed
to be lossless, linear, homogeneous, and isotropic.

a

We consider an incident monochromatic linearly polar-
ized plane wave from the ambient, which makes an angle
θ0 with the normal to the ﬁrst interface and has ampli-
tude E(+)
. The electric ﬁeld is either in the plane of
incidence (p polarization) or perpendicular to the plane
of incidence (s polarization). We consider as well another
plane wave of the same frequency and polarization, and
with amplitude E(−)
, incident from the substrate at the
s
same angle θ0. [16]

As a result of multiple reﬂections in all the interfaces,
we have a backward-traveling plane wave in the ambient,
denoted E(−)
, and a forward-traveling plane wave in the
a
substrate, denoted E(+)
. If we take the ﬁeld amplitudes
s
as a vector of the form

E =

E(+)
E(−) (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

(1)

(2)

(3)

which applies to both ambient and substrate media, then
the amplitudes at each side of the multilayer are related
2 complex matrix Mas, we shall call the mul-
by the 2
tilayer transfer matrix,

[17] in the form

×

Ea = Mas Es .

The matrix Mas can be shown to be of the form [6]

Mas =

are, respectively, the overall reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients for a wave incident from the ambient. Note
that we have det Mas = +1, which is equivalent to
2 = 1, and then the set of lossless multilayer

|
|
matrices reduces to the group SU(1,1), whose elements
depend on three independent real parameters.

2 +
|

|

The identity matrix corresponds to Tas = 1 and Ras =
0, so it represents an antireﬂection system without trans-
mission phase shift. The matrix that describe the over-
all system obtained by putting two multilayers together
is the product of the matrices representing each one of
them, taken in the appropriate order. So, two multilay-
ers, which are inverse, when composed give an antireﬂec-
tion system.

(5)

If we denote by Rsa and Tsa the overall reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients for a wave incident from the sub-
strate (physically this corresponds to the same multilayer
taken in the reverse order) one can check that [4]

RasRsa = exp(i2τ ),

−

Rsa =

R∗

as exp(i2τ ),

−

which is a generalization of the well-known Stokes rela-
tions [3] for the overall stack.

On the other hand, it is worth noting that, while the
picture of a multilayer taken in the reverse order is clear,
at ﬁrst sight it is not so easy to imagine the inverse of
that multilayer. However, using Eqs. (5), one can obtain
that

M−1

as = M∗

(6)

which remedies this drawback.

III. A BASIC FACTORIZATION FOR
MULTILAYERS: THE IWASAWA
DECOMPOSITION

Many matrix factorizations have been considered in
the literature [18, 19, 20], the goal of all of them being to
decompose a matrix as a unique product of other matri-
ces of simpler interpretation. Particularly, given the es-
sential role played by the Iwasawa decomposition, both in
fundamental studies and in applications to several ﬁelds
(especially in optics), one is tempted to investigate also
its role in multilayer optics.

Without embarking us in mathematical subtleties, the
Iwasawa decomposition is established as follows [21]: any
element of a (noncompact semi-simple) Lie group can be
written as an ordered product of three elements, taken
one each from a maximal compact subgroup K, a maxi-
mal Abelian subgroup A, and a maximal nilpotent sub-
group N. Furthermore, such a decomposition is global
and unique.

For a lossless multilayer matrix Mas

SU(1,1), the

decomposition reads as [14]

∈

Mas = K(φ) A(ξ) N(ν) ,

(7)

where

K(φ) =

The parameters φ, ξ, and ν are given in terms of the

fore, given a priori limits on α and β (i.e., on Tas and
Ras), one could easily establish the corresponding limits
on φ, ξ and ν, and vice versa.

Now, we can interpret the physical action of the matri-
ces appearing in Eq. (7). K(φ) represents the free prop-
agation of the ﬁelds E in the ambient medium through
an optical phase thickness of φ/2, which reduces to a
mere shift of the origin of phases. Alternatively, this can
be seen as an antireﬂection system. The second matrix
A(ξ) represents a symmetric multilayer with real trans-
mission coeﬃcient TA = sech(ξ/2) and reﬂection phase
π/2. There are many ways to get this perfor-
shift ρA =
mance, perhaps the simplest one is a Fabry-Perot system
composed by two identical plates separated by a trans-
parent spacer. By adjusting the refractive indices and the
thicknesses of the media one can always get the desired
values (see Section 7). Finally, the third matrix, N(ν),
represents a system having TN = cos(τN) exp(iτN) and
RN = sin(τN) exp(iτN), with tan(τN) = ν/2. The sim-
plest way to accomplish this task is by an asymmetrical
two-layer system.

IV. A REMARKABLE CASE: SYMMETRIC
MULTILAYERS

So far, we have discussed various properties of arbi-
trary lossless multilayers. However, the particular case
of symmetric structures has deserved a lot of attention.
In this Section, we wish to show how the Iwasawa de-
composition provides a nice tool to deal with them.

We recall that for a symmetric stack the reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients are the same whether light is
incident on one side or on the opposite side of the mul-
tilayer.
In consequence, one has Ras = Rsa and the
generalized Stokes relations (5) give then the well-known
result [22, 23, 24]

ρ

τ =

π/2.

−

±

(10)

This implies that the element β in the transfer matrix (3)
is a pure imaginary number. Therefore, the matrix Mas
depends only on two real parameters, which translates
into the fact that φ, ξ, and ν [see Eqs. (9)] are not in-
dependent. In fact, a straightforward calculation shows
that they must fulﬁll the constraint

ν = (eξ

1) tan(φ/2);

−

and thus Ras can be written as

Ras = e

−iφ tanh(ξ/2)[tan(φ/2)

i]
i tanh(ξ/2) tan(φ/2)

−

1

.

−

Particular care has been paid to the characterization
of zero reﬂectance conditions for these symmetrical sys-
tems [25, 26]. Equation (12) allows us to express the locii

(9)

of zero Ras by the simple condition

ξ = 0,

3

(13)

which, by Eq. (11) implies ν = 0 and imposes that in this
case Mas reduces trivially to a matrix K(φ).

The stability of these nonreﬂecting conﬁgurations has
been studied by Lekner [26]. Indeed, by using a conti-
nuity argument, he has shown that “almost all partial
reﬂectors with symmetric proﬁles which are close in pa-
rameter space to a proﬁle which has reﬂectivity zeros,
will also have reﬂectivity zeros”. We intend to show how
our formalism allows for a more precise criterion.

To this end, let us assume a symmetric multilayer sat-
isfying initially the condition (13). Now, suppose that
some parameter(s) (refractive index, thickness, angle of
incidence, ...), we shall generically denote by ℓ, is var-
ied. Obviously, admissible variations must preserve the
symmetry of the system.

The variation of ℓ induces changes in Ras, and so in φ
and ξ. The new multilayer will have also zero Ras if the
parameters satisfy dRas/dℓ = 0; that is,

then that the condition we are looking for is

(15)

This result fully characterizes the partial reﬂectors in-
voked by Lekner, and can be of practical importance for
the design of robust antireﬂection systems.

V. MULTILAYER TRANSFER FUNCTION IN
THE UNIT DISK

In many instances (e.g., in polarization optics [10]), we
are interested in the transformation properties of quo-
tients of variables rather than on the variables them-
selves. In consequence, it seems natural to consider the
complex numbers

z =

E(−)
E(+) ,

(16)

(11)

(12)

for both ambient and substrate. From a geometrical
viewpoint, Eq. (2) deﬁnes a transformation of the com-
plex plane C, mapping the point zs into the point za,
according to

za = Φ[Mas, zs] =

(17)

β∗ + α∗zs
α + βzs

.

Thus, the action of the multilayer can be seen as a func-
tion za = f (zs) that can be appropriately called the mul-
tilayer transfer function [9]. The action of the inverse
matrix M−1
as , za].

as is zs = Φ[M−1

These bilinear transformations deﬁne an action of the
group SU(1,1) on the complex plane C. The complex
plane appears then decomposed in three regions that re-
main invariant under the action of the group: the unit
disk, its boundary and the external region. [27]

The Iwasawa decomposition has an immediate trans-
lation in this geometrical framework, and one is led to
treat separately the action of each one of the matrices
appearing in this decomposition. To this end, it is worth
noting that the group SU(1,1) that we are considering ap-
pears always as a group of transformations of the complex
plane. The concept of orbit is especially appropriate for
obtaining an intuitive picture of the corresponding ac-
tion. We recall that, given a point z, its orbit is the
set of points z′ obtained from z by the action of all the
elements of the group. In Fig. 2 we have plotted some
typical orbits for each one of the subgroups of matrices
K(φ), A(ξ), and N(ν). For matrices K(φ) the orbits are
circumferences centered at the origin and passing by z.
For A(ξ), they are arcs of circumference going from the
point +i to the point
i through z. Finally, for the ma-
trices N(ν) the orbits are circumferences passing through
the point +i and joining the points z and

z∗.

VI. TRACE CRITERION FOR
CLASSIFICATION OF MULTILAYERS

To go beyond this geometrical picture of multilay-
ers, let us introduce the following classiﬁcation: a ma-
trix is of type K when [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4, is of type A
when [Tr(Mas)]2 > 4, and ﬁnally is of type N when
[Tr(Mas)]2 = 4. To gain insight into this classiﬁcation,
let us also introduce the ﬁxed points [28] of a transfer ma-
trix as the points in the complex plane that are invariant
under the action of Mas; i.e.,

z = Φ[Mas, z],

whose solutions are

Since we have

(18)

(19)

(20)

one can easily check that the matrices of type K have
two ﬁxed points, one inside and other outside the unit
disk, both related by an inversion; the matrices of type
A have two ﬁxed points both on the boundary of the unit
disk and, ﬁnally, the matrices of type N have only one
(double) ﬁxed point on the boundary of the unit disk.

Now the origin of the notation for these types of ma-
if one consider the Iwasawa de-
trices should be clear:
composition (7), one can see that the matrices K(φ) are
of type K with the origin as the ﬁxed point in the unit
disk, matrices A(ξ) are of type A with ﬁxed points +i

4

(22)

(23)

−

i and matrices N(ν) are of type N with the double
and
ﬁxed point +i. Of course, this is in agreement with the
orbits shown in Fig. 2.

To proceed further let us note that by taking the con-
SU(1,1) we obtain

jugate of Mas with any matrix C
another multilayer matrix; i.e.,

For our classiﬁcation viewpoint it is essential to remark
that if a multilayer has a transfer matrix of type K, A, or
N , one can always ﬁnd a family of matrices C such that
Mas in Eq. (21) is just a matrix K(φ), A(ξ), or N(ν), re-
spectively. The explicit construction of this family of ma-
b
trices is easy: it suﬃces to impose that C transforms the
ﬁxed points of Mas into the corresponding ﬁxed points of
K(φ), A(ξ), or N(ν). By way of example, let us consider
the case when Mas is of type K and its ﬁxed point inside
the unit disk is zf . Then, one should have

Φ[CMasC−1, 0] = Φ[CMas, zf ] = Φ[C, zf ] = 0.

(24)

where δ is a real free parameter. The same procedure
applies to the other two cases.

Since the matrix

Mas belongs to one of the subgroups
K(φ), A(ξ), or N(ν) of the Iwasawa decomposition, and
all these subgroups are, in our special case, Abelian and
uniparametric, we have that

Mas(µ2) =

where µ represent the adequate parameter φ, ξ, or ν.
Therefore, when dealing with a periodic layered system,
whose matrix is obtained as the N th power of the basic
period, we have

b

(27)

where Mas is now the matrix of the basic period. This
is a remarkable result [29], and our procedure highlights

b

that it does not depend on the explicit form of the basic
period.

We wish to point out that the trace criterion has been
previously introduced [30, 31] to treat the light propa-
gation in periodic structures. In fact, in that approach
the values of the trace separate the band-stop from the
band-pass regions of a period stratiﬁcation.

Finally, in order to broaden the physical picture of this
classiﬁcation, let us transform Eq. (2) by the unitary ma-
trix

the Iwasawa decomposition (7),
we get the corresponding one for SL(2,R), which has been
previously worked out [36]:

a family of matrices that gives a new vector basis such
that the action of the multilayer, when viewed in such
a basis, is exclusively rotationlike, or magniﬁerlike, or
lenslike [15].

VII. SIMPLE EXAMPLES AND CONCLUDING
REMARKS

It seems pertinent to conclude by showing how our ap-
proach works in some practical examples. Perhaps, the
best way of starting is to consider the simplest layered
structure one can imagine: a single ﬁlm sandwiched be-
tween the same ambient and substrate media. In spite
of its simplicity, it contains the essential physical ingre-
dients of multilayer optics.

In consequence, we consider a single transparent ﬁlm
(medium 1) of refractive index n1 and thickness d1 em-
bedded in air (medium 0). For this system we have [10]

thickness (here λ is the wavelength in vacuo of the inci-
dent light and θ1 is the refraction angle). Accordingly,
we get

(32)

−

[Tr(M010)]2 = 4 cos2 β1 ≤
and the equality holds only in resonance conditions; i.e.,
when
= 1. In consequence, the matrix
cos β1|
of a single ﬁlm is always of type K.

T010|
|

(33)

Let us consider now two ﬁlms (1 and 2) described by
the matrices M010 and M020, respectively. The compound
system obtained by putting them together is described
by the product of these matrices M010M020 [4, 6, 10]. In
conclusion, since any layered stack can be viewed as the
composition of single ﬁlms, this shows that any multilayer
matrix is generated by the product of matrices of type
K. Take into account that the product of two matrices
of type K (or A or N ) can have trace lesser than, greater
than or equal to 4.

On the other hand, as we have stated at the end of
Section 3, to get a pure matrix A(ξ) one should consider
a Fabry-Perot–like system formed by two identical plates
(each one of them with phase thickness β1) separated by
a spacer of air with phase thickness β2. If we take as ini-
tial condition that in the substrate zs = 0.4 exp(
iπ/3),
then a standard calculation gives Tas and Ras, and from
them we obtain the value za =
0.44 + 0.49 i, with the
parameters indicated in Fig. 3. Obviously, from these
(experimental) data alone we cannot infer at all the pos-
sible path for this discrete transformation.

−

−

However, the Iwasawa decomposition remedies this se-
rious drawback: from the geometrical meaning discussed
before, and once we know the values of φ, ξ, and ν [that
are easily computed from Eqs. (9)] we get, by the or-
dered application of the matrices K(φ), A(ξ), and N(ν),
that the trajectory from zs to za is well deﬁned through
the corresponding orbits, as shown in Fig. 3.

Moreover, and this is the important moral we wish to
extract from this simple example, if in some experiment
the values of zs and za are measured, one can ﬁnd, no

6

matter how complicated the multilayer is, in a unique
way, the three arcs of orbits that connect the initial and
ﬁnal points in the unit disk.

In Fig. 4 we have plotted the values of the parameters
φ, ξ, and ν for this system when β2 is varied between 0
and π. We have also plotted the values of [Tr(Mas)]2. It
is evident that the system can be of every type depending
on the value of β2. The marked points determine special
behaviors in agreement with Eq. (11) for symmetrical
systems: for the left one, φ = ν = 0 and the system is
represented by a pure matrix A(ξ); in the right one, ξ =
ν = 0 and then it is represented by a matrix K(φ); i.e., it
is antireﬂection stack with Tas = exp(
iφ/2). Note that
this system can never be represented by a matrix N(ν),
because it is symmetric.

−

To show the characteristic properties of an asymmetric
system, we consider, as indicated in Section 3, the sim-
plest one constituted by a two-layer stack made of a glass

plate (with phase thickness β1) coated with a ﬁlm of zinc
sulphide (with phase thickness β2).
In Fig. 5 we have
plotted the values of φ, ξ, and ν, as well as [Tr(Mas)]2,
when β1 is ﬁxed and β2 is varied between 0 and π. From
our previous analysis it is clear that only in the marked
point we have φ = ξ = 0 and [Tr(Mas)]2 = 4, so the
system is represented by a pure matrix N(ν). Contrary
to the previous example, this system can never be repre-
sented by a matrix A(ξ), because it is asymmetric.

In summary, we expect that the geometrical scenario
presented here could provide an appropriate tool for an-
alyzing and classifying multilayer performance in an ele-
gant and concise way that, additionally, could be closely
related to other ﬁelds of physics.

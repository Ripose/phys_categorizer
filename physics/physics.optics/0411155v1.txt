Abstract

Absorption of light by a nanoparticle in the presence of resonant atom
and ﬂuorescence of the latter are theoretically investigated. It is shown,
that absorption of light by a nanoparticle can be increased by several or-
ders because of presence of atom. It is established, that optical bistability
in such system is possible.

1 Introduction

The cross-section of light adsorption by an isolated spherical nanoparticle imbed-
ded in a host medium and which radius a is essentially smaller then light wave-
length λ in the medium (a/λ ≪ 1) is given by the classical formula [1]

σp = 24π

a
λ

ǫ′′
|ǫ + 2|2 S ,

where S = πa2, ǫ ≡ εp/εh = ǫ′ + iǫ′′ is the relative complex dielectric function
of the nanoparticle, εh and εp are dielectric functions of the nonabsorbing host
medium and nanoparticle respectively.

As a rule, σp is smaller then geometrical cross-section of the nanoparticle S.
On the other hand, it is well known that the cross-section of resonant atom-light
interaction is considerably larger:

where γ0h and γ are the radiation and the total width of the resonant transition
of an atom imbedded in a host medium. Note that γ0h is expressed in terms

of free-space spontaneous emission rate 2γ0 as γ0h ≡ (εh)1/2|(εh + 2)/3|γ0 (see,
e.g., [2, 3]).

As a rule, σp ≪ σa (see Fig. 1).

The aim of the paper is clariﬁcation of the probability of cascade energy
transfer from light to an atom and then to a nanoparticle [4], and investigation
of atomic ﬂuorescence in this conditions.

2 Oscillating classical dipole

Let us consider an auxiliary problem connected with atomic excitation transfer
to a nanoparticle, the particle absorption of the electric ﬁeld energy of clas-
sical dipole d ≡ d{sin(ψ), 0, cos(ψ)} which oscillates with frequency ω and is
at a distance R from the nanoparticle center. The power Qc absorbed by the
nanoparticle can be represented in the form

Qc = − ˙d(R) δE(R) ,

where δE(R) is the ‘image ﬁeld’ of the dipole, and overline denotes time aver-
aging over the time that is considerably greater than period of light wave. Since
δE depends linearly on d, the absorbed power Qc can be rewritten as

(3)

(4)

Qc = 2ω Im

where Gαβ(R, R; ω) is the ﬁeld susceptibility (or tensor-valued Green function):

δEα(r, ω) =

Gαβ(r, r′; ω)dβ(r′, ω) .

2.1 Field susceptibility

Xβ

In the near zone (R ≪ λ) the ‘image ﬁeld’ of the dipole (and, consequently, G)
can be found by solving electrostatic Laplace equation. One can start with the
scalar potential of a single charge e located on the axis Z at the distance R from
the center of the particle [5]):

where Pn(cos(θ)) is the Legendre polynom and θ is an elevation angle of the
vector r.

The potential of the point-like dipole d located on the axis Z at the distance
R from the center of the particle is the sum of potentials (6) caused to nearly
situated charges e and −e

So, the ‘image ﬁeld’ and G are found from (7) and represented as a series
(see, for example, [6]). This series diverges when R → a, so that the higher
terms start play the major part in it. Fortunately, one possible to rewrite it in
a reasonable way, so that the ﬁeld susceptibility tensor can be expressed in the

As is well known, in this case the ‘image ﬁeld’ that corresponds to (10) and
(11) can be represented by the sum of the ﬁelds of the charge q0 ≡ adz/R2
and −q0, and of the dipole d0 ≡ (a/R)3d{− sin(ψ), 0, cos(ψ)} ﬁeld. The
charge -q0 is placed at the particle center; the charge q0 and dipole d0 are
located along Z axis at the distance a̺0 from dipole d(another words, at
distance a2/R from the particle center toward the dipole d).

Similarly to this limit case, the ﬁrst three terms in square brackets of the equa-
tions (8) and (9) can be interpreted as the sum of the ﬁelds of the charges
q ≡ µ3(ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 1)q0, −q, qǫ ≡ −q/ǫ, −qǫ, and of the dipole d1 ≡ µ3(ǫ −
1)/(ǫ + 1)d0. Charge q and dipole d1 are located along Z axis at the distance
R′
1 ≡ a̺ from dipole d, whereas the charge −q is disposed at the distance
from dipole d along the same Z axis. Charges qǫ
R1 ≡ aρ
and −qǫ are located at the distance R1 and R′
1 respectively from dipole d along
X axis (see Fig. 2). These terms of the equations (8) and (9) dominate while as

Substituting this expression in (15) we get (14).

nonradiative one γc.

The ﬁeld susceptibility, G, Eqs. (8)–(9), is the quasistatic approximation
of the exact one, Gex. Hence, it is responsible for nonradiative decay only.

5 Eﬃciency of the cascade energy transfer

Eﬃciency of the cascade energy transfer η ≡ Qc/Qp (where Qp = Iσp) can be
found by using expressions (1), (19) and (26)

Obvious, eﬃciency of the cascade energy transfer can rich as much as several
orders of magnitude because of multiplication of large values λ/a, σa/S, |ǫ +

The limit cases

• Large distances, R/a ≫ 1

In this case ˜γ → 1, ˜γc ∼ R−6 (see Eqs. (27) and (13)). Hence, Eq. (29) is
became

η ∼ R−6.

• Small distances, R/a − 1 ≪ 1

In this conditions ˜γ ≈ ˜γc ∼ (R/a − a/R)−3 (see Eqs. (27) and (11)).
Assuming in addition 1

2 ˜γ−2ξ2g( ˜Ω) ˜I ≪ 1, we get from Eq. (29)

η ∼ (R/a − a/R)3.

This decreasing of η is rather unexpected because the probability of the
energy transfer from atom to nanoparticle is about 1 in this case. How-
ever, atomic resonance cross-section is decreased when γ is increased (see
Eq.(2)).

It is supposed that the light frequency is tuned in to the resonance atomic
frequency at any distance. Calculations are made for a silver nanoparticle
(εp = −15.37 + i0.231, λ = 6328 nm)

So, the eﬃciency is decreased both for large and small distances between
atom and particle. Therefore, it achieves a maximum at an intermediate R &
a. Fig. 3 shows eﬃciency of the cascade energy transfer η versus R/a in the
assumption of the exact resonance at any R/a. On the other hand, ﬁgure Fig. 4

This sharply outlined resonance can be used to determine location of an

atom regarding the surface with subnanometer precision.

As well known, the qubic equation (33) may have 3 solution at some param-
eters. Therefore, z may exhibit bistable behaviour. In the Fig. 6 it is shown the
regions of such bistability.

8 Conclusions

• Cascade energy transfer eﬃciency can rich as mach as several order of

magnitude (103 − 105)

• Eﬃciency is drastically decreased at both large and small distances be-

tween atom and nanoparticle surface

• For constant light frequency the eﬃciency as sharply as resonance depends

from the distance between atom and nanoparticle

• This sharp dependence can be used to determine the atom position near

the surface

• Bistability may take place when the population diﬀerence and the rela-
tive growth of the image part of the particle dielectric function have the
opposite signs.

We report on high-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of spatial structure of
InAs/AlGaAs quantum dots (QDs) by using a near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscope (NSOM).
The double-peaked distribution of PL spectra is clearly observed, which is associated with the bi-
modal size distribution of single QDs. In particular, the size diﬀerence of single QDs, represented
by the doublet spectral distribution, can be directly observed by the NSOM images of PL.

Self-assembly growth process has raised interesting
questions regarding the growth dynamics of quantum
dots (QDs) and the resulting size and shape distribu-
tions.1,2,3 The size uniformity of InAs/GaAS QDs is typ-
ically broken beyond QD deposition of more than 2.0
monolayer, which is characterized by the bimodal or mul-
timodal QD distribution.4,5 In previous works, the spatial
structures of the bimodal QD systems have been inves-
tigated by observing photoluminescence (PL) at various
conditions of QD coverage growth.4,6,7,8,9 These results
have been valuable for understanding optical properties
of QD ensemble structures grown with various cover-
age thickness. However, it is diﬃcult to acquire a high
spatial as well as spectral resolution of single QDs in
bimodal QD system if far-ﬁeld optical spectroscopy is
employed. Several experiments have been performed by
using a near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscope (NSOM)
for nano-scale optical measurement of semiconductor QD
structures.11,12,13,14 Such a unique capability may allow
a detailed study of individual QDs that are grown under
various structure conditions. In this Letter, we report on
the observation of high-resolution near-ﬁeld laser spec-
troscopy of bimodal QD size distributions in the high-
density InAs/AlGaAs QD structures.

High density (∼5.5 ×1010 cm−2) InAs QDs, embed-
ded in 50-nm AlGaAs cladding layers with a 5-nm GaAs
capping layer, were grown by molecular beam epitaxy.
The InAs/AlGaAs QD structure was grown on a 100-
nm-thick GaAs buﬀer layer deposited on a GaAs (100)
substrate.3 This structure conﬁnes strongly charge carri-
ers within single QDs due to the large energy diﬀerence
between InAs QDs and AlGaAs barriers. However, the
size uniformity of QDs is not so good due to the strain
induced by lattice mismatch between InAs QDs and Al-
GaAs barriers. Thus the size distribution and deposition
thickness of InAs single QDs is not uniform and depends
on the speciﬁc location of nano-scale region on the sam-
ple, even though the average coverage of InAs is about
2.3 monolayer.

For optical pumping of QDs, a Ti:sapphire laser, op-
erated at the photon energy of 1.67 eV, was used. The
excitation laser light was coupled to a single-mode opti-
cal ﬁber and guided to a chemically etched sharp ﬁber
tip on which a 100-nm gold-coated aperture was fabri-
cated.15 Such a nano-scale light source, generated by an
apertured ﬁber probe, made it possible to excite single

InAs QDs in small area with nano-scale position selec-
tivity. The resulting PL signal was collected by the same
ﬁber so that any loss of spatial resolution due to diﬀu-
sion could be minimized.13,16,17 Both the sample and the
apertured ﬁber probe were enclosed in a He-ﬂow-type
cryostat and kept at 10 K. The PL signal was dispersed
by a 0.3 m single monochromator with a spectral res-
olution of 0.3 meV and detected by a liquid-nitrogen-
cooled charge coupled device camera to accomplish the
high signal-to-noise ratio.

Figure 1 shows the time-integrated, high-resolution PL
spectra collected for 10 s at each excitation power density
from 0.3 to 8 kW/cm2. We have observed many sharp
PL peaks of single QDs, with an average linewidth of
about 0.7 meV. It is found that the PL intensity, resulting
from the ground state (dotted arrows), is saturated as the
excitation power density is increased. The PL from the
excited state (solid arrows), on the other hand, emerges
and its intensity increases with excitation power.

Figure 2 shows the time-integrated PL spectra col-
lected for 10 s, obtained at diﬀerent positions on the
same sample with 8 kW/cm2 excitation power density.
In Fig. 2(a), the PL peaks may be ﬁtted by one Gaus-
sian distribution, which is the same as that obtained at

temperature using an 100-nm-apertured optical ﬁber tip with
increasing the excitation power density from 0.3 to 8 kW/cm2.

the excitation power density of 8 kW/cm2 in Fig. 1. How-
ever, the PL spectrum in Fig. 2(b), obtained at a diﬀerent
position, could be decomposed into two Gaussian distri-
butions (centered at 1.34 eV and 1.38 eV, respectively)
and a shoulder (centered at 1.45 eV). The similar PL
peaks in Fig. 2(c) can be relatively clearly divided into
two dominated Gaussian distributions (centered at 1.33
and 1.38 eV, respectively) and a shoulder (centered at
1.45 eV). This feature of Gaussian distributions shown
in Figs. 2(b) and (c) are the characteristic ﬁngerprints of
the bimodal size distributions of single QDs, obtained in
far-ﬁeld PL experiments on the samples having various
QD thickness.4,5,6,7,8,9,10 Note that the reported energy
interval between doublet-like features of far-ﬁeld PL spec-
tra due to the bimodal-sized QDs was about several tens
meV,5,6,7 as similarly observed in our experiment.

Each PL spectrum, which can be ﬁtted into three
groups by Gaussian functions as in Figs. 2(b) and (c),
can be attributed to two contributions of QD size dis-

apertured optical ﬁber tip at the excitation power density of

ground, excited states of large size single QDs, and ground,
excited states of small size single QDs, respectively.

tribution. The ﬁrst group is the lowest energy distribu-
tion (centered at 1.33 eV in Fig. 2(b) and 1.34 eV in
Fig. 2(c)), which is associated with the ground states
of large-sized QDs (EL(g)). And the second one, repre-
sented by the middle energy group (centered at 1.38 eV
in Fig. 2(b) and (c)), is contributed by the excited states
of large-sized QDs (EL(e)) as well as the ground states of
small-sized QDs (ES(g)). The last group is the shoulder
group, centered at 1.45 eV in Fig. 2(b) and (c), comes
from the excited states of small-sized QDs (ES(e)), as
also reported by other works.4,9

We may observe that the thickness of InAs QDs at the
sample position in Fig. 2(b) and (c) is larger than that in
Fig. 2(a), because it was obtained at the lower-energy PL
peaks (EL(g)) in the doublet-like PL peak-distribution.
The number of large-sized QDs in Fig. 2(c) is also con-
sidered to be larger than that in Fig. 2(b), because the
Gaussian peak at EL(g) in Fig. 2(c) is lower by 10 meV
and broader by 22 meV than that in Fig. 2(b). Here the
center of energy state and linewidth of EL(g) Gaussian
peaks are 1.34 eV and 33 meV [1.33 eV and 55 meV]
in Fig. 2(b) [2(c)], respectively. Thus, we infer that the
InAs QDs coverage on position in Fig. 2(c) is larger than
in Fig. 2(b). This is the ﬁrst time observation of varying
the near-ﬁeld PL spectra of bimodal size-distributed QDs
on diﬀerent InAs deposited positions of sample with such
a high spectral resolving power.

The PL spectrum from 1.362 eV to 1.404 eV in
Fig. 2(c) is magniﬁed and shown in Fig. 3(a). This spec-
trum was collected with a probe located at the center of
scanning PL image area which was marked by a cross as
illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3(a). Note that there are
EL(e) peaks and ES(g) peaks in this PL spectrum range
(from 1.35 eV to 1.41 eV) in Fig. 2(c). We also obtain PL

images of selected three PL peaks(1.3762 eV, 1.3854 eV,
and 1.3884 eV) at the same area (500 nm×500 nm) in
Fig. 3(b), (c), and (d).

The data acquisition(DAQ) process is as follows:

(1)The 100 nm apertured probe is located on a selected
sample position and PL spectrum is taken in the entire
spectral range with a nitrogen-cooled CCD camera dur-
ing 10 s.
(2)This DAQ process is repeated sequentially in all other
20 × 20 pixels of the scanning area.
(3)Then, each PL image at a given energy level from the
400 data ﬁles is processed to obtain the corresponding
energy and spatial spectrum of the InAs single QDs.17

The FWHM of horizontal cross section axis on the
PL images in Fig. 3(b), (c), and (d) are about 200 nm,
260 nm, and 400 nm, respectively. The large-sized sin-
gle QD with anisotropic PL image in Fig. 3(d) is due to
our growth condition that the average InAs deposition
thickness is about 2.3 ML. Note that if the thickness of
a deposited InAs layer is larger than 2.0 ML, large QDs
with a diameter and height greater than that of the aver-
age single QDs size (in our case, 20 nm lateral dimension
and 0.7-nm height) are created as in the previous obser-

vations.2,4,5 We have found that the size of single QD of
1.3854 eV is about twice larger than that of 1.3884 eV
and 1.3762 eV PL peaks in Fig. 3. Therefore, it seems
clear that each selective peaks were divided by EL(e)
peaks(centered at 1.3854 eV) and ES(g) peaks(centered
at 1.3884 eV, 1.3762 eV) with PL spectrum in Fig. 2(c)
and PL images in Fig. 3. It is very diﬃcult to discrim-
inate the size diﬀerence of single QDs, which are grown
in such a high density (∼5.5 ×1010 cm−2) and embed-
ded in between barrier and cap layers. Nevertheless, we
have distinguished single QDs with diﬀerent size having
selective PL energy states from the measured PL images
obtained by using an NSOM.

In conclusion, we have observed the variation of high-
resolution PL spectra associated with the size distribu-
tion depending on diﬀerent locations of QDs structure.
We also have characterized the size-diﬀerence of single
QDs having PL peaks in doublet-like distribution by us-
ing the PL images obtained by an NSOM.

The atoms moving within the waveguide with a critical frequency higher

than the resonant frequency of atoms are suggested for obtaining the ”slow

light”. Due to the absence of the resonant mode in the guide the atoms

conserves excitation and coherence. The speed of this mixed excitation (elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld + moving atom) can be very low or even zero.

The ”slow light” optics is a new trend in physics which appeared during the last decade.

The main problem of the ”slow light” physics is to create some medium in which the speed

of optical pulse can be reduced up to several tens meters per second. Medium with a ”slow

light” is supposed to be used for storage and processing of information. The review of

achievements and questionable points in ”slow light” research one can ﬁnd in [1]. The goal

of the present paper is to discuss the obtaining of the ”slow light” by means of atoms moving

through the waveguide with critical frequency higher than the resonant frequency of atoms.

Let us consider the two-level atom with resonant frequency ω0 placed into the waveguide

tube whose transverse size h is small enough for critical frequency of the waveguide ωc be

higher than the resonant frequency of the atom i.e. ωc > ω0. Hence the electromagnetic

wave with frequency ω0 is exponentially decays (grows) along the waveguide with some

characteristic length λ ∼ h (Fig.1 a). Let our two-level atom be excited, so its electrical

dipole moment is oscillating at frequency ω0. Due to the above mentioned property of the

waveguide no radiation decay take place and the amplitude of oscillations is conserving the

same for inﬁnitely long time. The oscillating dipole moment produce the electromagnetic

ﬁeld around the atom but this ﬁeld goes down to zero on the right and left hand of the

1

atom with characteristic length λ (Fig.1 b). So we come to the conclusion that the oscil-

lating dipole within the waveguide with appropriate critical frequency forms some localised

excitation having zero speed and spatial size ∼ λ along the waveguide. This excitation is

of mixed (atom + electromagnetic ﬁeld) nature. The increasing of lifetime of the oscillator

placed into the resonator having no resonant mode is wellknown and have been observed

experimentally.

If atom has non-zero speed v along the waveguide this excitation will travel along the

waveguide. Note that the speed v of this mixed (atom + electromagnetic ﬁeld) excitation can

be pretty low or even zero. The quantization of this mixed excitation must give the polariton

with very low speed of propagation. These excitations can be treated as a ”slow light” and

can be used for creating of low speed optical pulses in the following experiment. Suppose

that some amount of atoms in the ground state have been prepared near the left end of

the waveguide. Let resonant electromagnetic pulse focused on the left end of the waveguide

create the cloud of excited atoms near the left end of the guide. Under the action of this pulse

this cloud acquire some momentum and start moving along the waveguide. This momentum

can be estimated using the balance of photon and atom momentum: ¯hω0/c = mv, where

c - is a speed of ligth, m - mass of the atom, v - speed of the atom. Because of the small

value of photon momentum the speed of atom v can be many times smaller than that of

light in vacuum. Due to the absence of the resonant electromagnetic mode in the waveguide

these atoms conserves optical excitation and coherence and moves slowly to the right end

of the guide. After reaching of the right end of the guide the cloud of excited atoms emits

the electromagnetic pulse similar to that which produced this cloud on the left end of the

guide. The time delay between the initial pulse on the left end of the guide and the pulse

emitted from the right end is determined by the speed of atoms within the guide and can

be very large.

One can control the propagation of excited atoms through the waveguide by changing the

transverse size of the guide. The variation of the transverse size of the waveguide produces

the corresponding potential distribution for the excited atoms within the guide. Using this

2

fact one can speed up or slow down the cloud of excited atoms described above.

Note that the waveguide must be empty before the cloud of excited atoms start moving.

It sounds like truth that this cloud of excited atoms within the waveguide with ωc > ω0 has

much in common with soliton. What will happens if two optical pulses acts on the left end

of the guide in the above experimental setup? In this case two separated clouds of excited

atoms will be injected into the guide. If the spatial gap between these clouds is larger than

λ ∼ h the clouds will propagate independently. So minimal spatial distance between the

clouds must be ∼ h. The interaction between clouds is a matter of calculation.

If the resonant frequency of the atom in above experiment lays in the optical region

(the corresponding wave length is ∼ 1µm) the transverse size of the waveguide tube must

be less than 1µm. The losses in the waveguide must be low enough for dipole moment

oscillation not to decay during atoms travels from one end of the guide to another.

It

seems impossible to create such a device at present time but the achievements of modern

technology (the photonic crystals technology) gives some hopes that it will become possible

in nearest future.

Be free to comment and criticize all the above statements in online regime.

FIG. 1. a. The electromagnetic ﬁeld at frequency ω0 goes down to zero within the guide whose

critical frequency ωc > ω0, b. The atom whose dipole moment is oscillating at frequency ω0 < ωc

conserve its excitation and produce the localized electromagnetic ﬁeld within the guide. This

excited atom can travel along the guide and introduce the ”slow light”.

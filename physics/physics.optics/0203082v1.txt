ABSTRACT
A perfect focus telescope is one in which all rays parallel to the axis meet at a point
and give equal magniﬁcation there. It is shown that these two conditions deﬁne the
shapes of both primary and secondary mirrors. Apart from scale, the solution depends
upon two parameters, s, which gives the mirror separation in terms of the eﬀective
focal length, and K, which gives the relative position of the ﬁnal focus in that unit.
The two conditions ensure that the optical systems have neither spherical aberration
nor coma, no matter how fast the f ratio. All known coma–free systems emerge as
approximate special cases. In his classical paper, K. Schwarzschild studied all two
mirror systems whose proﬁles were conic sections. We make no such a priori shape
conditions but demand a perfect focus and solve for the mirrors’ shapes.

Key words: optics – telescopes – cameras – coma – spherical aberration.

INTRODUCTION

When the author saw the optical design for the corrector of
the Hobby–Eberly Telescope, which involved four reﬂections
after the primary and produced a four minute of arc ﬁeld,
he decided that it ought to be possible to do better. This
led him to study optics from ﬁrst principles. The methods
used have much in common with those of Descartes (1634),
(see Smith 1925) but the author has one signal advantage
in that Newton’s calculus is known now, whereas Descartes
(1596–1650) had to rely on geometry alone; (indeed it is of
some interest that Descartes seems to have invented ana-
lytical geometry in order to solve optical problems). Optics
and optical phenomena have stimulated work by many great
scientists besides Descartes. Galileo (1564–1642), Mersenne
(1588–1650)(1636), Fermat (1601–1665), Huygens (1629–
1695), Hooke (1635–1702), Newton (1642–1727)(1704), W.
Herschel (1738–1822), Young (1773–1829)(1802), Fresnel
(1788–1827), Hamilton (1788–1856)(1824, 1830, 1832, 1931),
Foucault (1819–1868), Zeiss (1816–1888), Seidel (1821–
1896)(1856), Maxwell
(1831–1879), Abbe (1840–1905),
Michelson (1852–1931), Schwarzschild (1873–1916)(1905),
Schmidt (1879–1935)(1931), Einstein (1879–1955), Zernicke
(1888–1966) made major advances in our understanding.
The work of Lord Rosse (1800–1867), Ritchey (1864-1945)
and Chr´etien (1879–1956)(1922) much improved the optics
of large telescopes.

In past centuries aspheric surfaces were very expen-
sive and diﬃcult to make, so attention was concentrated on
spherical surfaces or those whose proﬁles were conic sections
(see e.g., Schwarzschild (1905)). The coming of computers
has enabled the designer to evaluate the performance of even
very complicated optics with ease. Thus computers may be

c(cid:13) 2001 RAS

programmed to optimise a design according to whatever cri-
teria are chosen. This has revolutionised optical design. In
reality the design is computed by directed trial and error. In
the hands of an experienced optical designer this is a very
powerful and adaptable method which will doubtless remain
the prime tool for the foreseeable future, see e.g., Willstrop,
R.V. (1987) who gave a ﬁne wide–ﬁeld telescope design. An-
gel’s wide–ﬁeld survey telescope is based on a development
of this design with smaller ﬁeld and a smaller hole in the
primary. I understand that this is now to be built with an
eight metre primary mirror.

Traditional optical theory expands all the trigonometric
functions in powers of the angles. Baker (1940) and Burch
(1942) implemented Petzval’s theory to eliminate the low-
est order astigmatism, and the book by Korsch (1992) gives
an account of further developments in that direction. Com-
puter based ray–tracing developed by Wynne (1959, 1974)
led to ﬁne designs for multi-element glass prime focus correc-
tors which gave larger ﬁelds to a whole generation of optical
telescopes. However, the design of aerials for centimeter and
millimeter radio astronomy and communications led to a re-
quirement for very fast designs where the angles were not
small. The coming of computers has allowed such designs
to be investigated numerically and this led to a new ﬂow-
ering of computationally based optics. The book by Mertz
(1996) gives original, fast and imaginative optical designs.
Methods for fast optical designing are given in the book by
Cornbleet (1994). This is no place to discuss the myriad of
designs produced by computer optics because the paper is
devoted to analytical mathematical theory.

Quite recently new optical fabrication techniques have
made it possible to produce mirrors of any desired proﬁle,

although those with axial symmetry are still much cheaper.
This makes the study of systems with mirrors which may
be of any shape especially topical. Whereas the earliest
workers prescribed the shapes and then asked what the sys-
tem would do, cataloging its failures as “aberrations”, the
modern ray–tracing methods are really solving an inverse
problem in which the mirror shapes are varied until the de-
sired performance is achieved as closely as possible. Here we
shall use analytical methods but leave the shapes of the two
mirrors to be determined so as to give an exact on–axis focus
near which all rays give equal magniﬁcation. We show that
this problem may be solved exactly yielding a two parame-
ter family of exact ray–optical solutions even for very fast F
ratios. Some of our solutions are more appropriate for spec-
trograph cameras than for telescopes. Others, with exact foci
at which the rays enter over a hemisphere or more, may be
appropriate for solar furnaces or lighthouses. In discovering
exact formulae for all two mirror telescopes/cameras with
neither spherical aberration nor coma the diﬃcult part is
not in proving the theorems but in ﬁnding the right variables
so that the problem can be solved analytically in parametric
form. Directed trial and error by a persistent mathematician
who feels the problem is simple enough to have a nice solu-
tion, here replaces the directed trial and error of the optical
designer with a computer. However, although the analyti-
cal method covers all cases at once, it is conﬁned to perfect
images at and close to the optic axis, whereas the main in-
terest lies in the breadth of ﬁeld oﬀ the axis. The author has
gained much from the tutelage of an expert on optics, Dr
R.V. Willstrop, and he has used his computer ray–tracing
methods to show that these designs give as good oﬀ–axis
performance as those designed with computers.

Although there are some new designs to be found among
our two parameter set of solutions, most of the useful de-
signs were discovered long ago. In this respect, the present
paper may be regarded as a uniﬁcation of all those opti-
cal designs into analytical formulae. These formulae have
the small advantage of giving ‘perfect’ on axis performance.
The reason we have concentrated on the removal of spheri-
cal aberration and coma is that these aberrations depend on
the lowest powers of the angle oﬀ axis, α. They are therefore
the dominant aberrations close to the axis. Table 1 gives the
behaviour of the aberrations with that angle and with the
F ratio, F = focal length/aperture.

Whereas our systems are free of the ﬁrst two aberrations
by design, some of them are also free of astigmatism. It may
be argued that digital recorders may in principle be made to
ﬁt ﬁeld curvature, and distortion is readily removed in the
computer.

Even on axis, the rays emerging from some achromatic
axially symmetrical optical train do not generally give a
good focus; rather those rays at an angle 2θ to the axis

will cross it at some point x(θ) which depends on θ. The
function x(θ) plays a prominent role in our analysis so we
call it the defocusing function. Only when it is constant do
all the rays pass through a focus without any corrector. Such
systems are said to have no spherical aberration.

In section 2 we give a Lemma that shows how to correct
a given set of rays for spherical aberration. This Lemma can
be useful on its own when only a point focus is needed, so
coma is unimportant.

We show that rays with a known defocusing function
may be redirected to an exact focus at any chosen point,
xf , on axis by a corrector mirror whose pole is at xc. This
mirror’s shape and size are given explicitly in terms of the
defocusing function x(θ) and the parameters xf and xc. We
also show that the corrector mirror’s shape is completely
determined by the uniting function U (θ) which unites the
dependency on x(θ) with that on xf and xc.

In section 3 we show that any given defocusing func-
tion can arise from a single primary mirror whose pole is at
any chosen xp. Thus x(θ) and xp together totally determine
the shape, size and position of the primary mirror. We go
on to show that any two mirror telescope is characterised
by specifying just the uniting function U (θ) and the mirror
separation xp
xc. However, most such telescopes will be
almost useless save for limited point spectroscopy because
the rays that come to the ﬁnal focus originating from diﬀer-
ent rings of the primary mirror will arrive carrying diﬀerent
magniﬁcations. Objects a little oﬀ axis will therefore suﬀer
from coma which can be severe.

−

Many years ago, Abbe (1873) (see Jenkins & White
1957) gave the criterion for eliminating coma near the axis.
The rays arriving at focus when projected back must meet
the corresponding incoming parallel rays on a sphere centred
at the focus.

In section 4 we show that Abbe’s condition used in con-
junction with the results of sections 2 and 3 gives a diﬀeren-
tial equation which we solve to determine the shapes of both
primary mirror and corrector. Thus we have determined all
perfect–focus two mirror telescopes. The resulting systems
depend on three parameters: 1. The scale; 2. A dimension-
less ratio s that determines the separation of the two mirrors
in units of eﬀective focal length of the whole system; 3. The
dimensionless ratio K that measures the distance of ﬁnal
focus from the secondary measured in that unit. Thus sec-
tion 4 proves the main theorem, and gives the shapes of the
mirror systems parameterised by s and K.

This paper derives and explores the properties of such
systems on axis. Their properties oﬀ axis are best explored
by ray tracing. The accompanying paper describes the re-
sults of such studies.

We thank the referee for pointing out, that the problem
of designing two aspheric surfaces has been considered more
concisely by Born & Wolf (1999) and is the subject of their
paragraphs 4.10.1 and 4.10.2. Indeed they treat both the
lens and the mirror cases, but paragraph 4.10.2 ends some-
what lamely by giving two complicated simultaneous ﬁrst
order non-linear diﬀerential equations with their boundary
conditions and saying that they may be integrated numer-
ically case by case. The advance made here is that for two
mirrors new variables are found in terms of which the dif-
ferential equations are integrated analytically to give the
general solution for the mirrors’ shapes. Exploration of the

full panoply of solutions, for all s all K and all F -numbers,
is therefore made easy. The actual mirror shapes found for
very fast systems have cusps and asymptotes which might
prove awkward to compute numerically over the full range
in the variables of Born & Wolf. However fore-warned is
fore-armed and given the answers here derived those who
prefer totally numerical work will no doubt be able now to
reproduce each particular case in turn, to the accuracy of
the computation.

2 A SPHERICAL ABERRATION CORRECTOR

FOR ANY RAYS WITH AN AXIS

Let the rays emerging from some optical train at an angle
2θ to the axis intersect it at some point x(θ) as in Figure 1.
We wish to ﬁnd the shape of a corrector mirror (with pole at
xc) which will bring rays of all θ to an exact focus at some
prescribed point on axis, xf .

Q.E.D.

Notice that these equations give R(θ) and X(θ)
uniquely once x(θ) and the parameters xf & xc are known.
Equivalently, if U (θ) is taken as known, then the shape of the
corrector mirror is determined by (11), (16), (17) and dif-
ferent values of xf give the same mirror displaced provided
that the same function U (θ) is used. In this respect U (θ)
is more closely related to the corrector’s shape than is the
defocusing function x(θ). Notice also that systems for which
the corrector has the same intrinsic shape but are scaled up
by a factor λ have λU replacing U . So in this respect too the
function U characterises the corrector mirror. It is therefore
sensible to use U (θ) rather than x(θ) where this is possible.
In any particular case we plot R(θ) against X(θ) to get

the corrector’s shape.

Post–focus correctors are already included in the anal-
ysis if we allow for φ being of the opposite sign to θ and
R < 0. Since the solution – (14) (15) – is given paramet-
rically, we may expect to encounter the cusps and folds of
catastrophe theory. Indeed, some of the strangest mirrors
come from these.

This Lemma is formally stated here because it is needed
in the proof of the main theorem in section 4. The Lemma
is not new. Cornbleet (1994) states that x(θ) determines the
mirror’s shape, and the principles on which the Lemma is
based are clearly stated by Descartes (1634).

Parallel rays fall on a concave spherical mirror of radius of
curvature a. The reﬂected rays at angle 2θ to the axis meet
it at points distant a(1

from the paraxial focus of rays at small θ. We measure x(θ)

drawn. The spherical aberration has them crossing at about
0.01 rather than at zero. After hitting any one of these cor-
rectors these (and all other rays) will be redirected to pass
through the new exact focus at 0.

One of the mirrors is now very strangely shaped (like a
trumpet), with a pronounced cusp at the focus. It reﬂects
some rays by external glancing incidence (actually 62% of
the light, see ﬁgure 3) but gets in the way of those near the
axis. We shall say more of this later.

In ﬁgure 2b we draw four other correctors for the same
spherical primary but we have now moved the ﬁnal focus
to
0.05 to the left of the original paraxial focus. Again
all these mirrors reﬂect the diverging rays to the new fo-
cus and all are possible alternative correctors for spherical
aberration.

−

Figure 2c is the same as the others, but now the ﬁnal
focus is to the right of the uncorrected one, so all the mirrors
reﬂect the rays back to make the corrected focus at +0.05.
The diagrams illustrate the variety of corrector mirrors
for just one primary, a fast sphere. There is a two parame-
ter set of possible correctors, however, most of them suﬀer
from very bad coma when used oﬀ axis. Most of the rest
of this paper is concerned with the question of eliminating
this coma by suitable choices of the shapes of both primary
and secondary mirrors. We now show that the very strange
cusped mirror of ﬁgure 2a satisﬁes Abbe’s condition and has
no coma although its peculiar shape gives it a very small
ﬁeld.

This unusual, but interesting, trumpet–shaped correc-

tor is found by taking xf = xc = 0 in e(18). Then

For such a corrector the rays are not reﬂected back but are
given a glancing reﬂection which allows them to continue to
the focus, see Figure 3. In this case the focus coincides with
the paraxial focus of the uncorrected rays. The shape of the
corrector as given by (6) and e(21) is

which is a cardiod with its cusp at the focus. We have deﬁned
the acute angle Φ = π
φ which for this system is equal to
θ. Thus after correction the rays halve their angle to the
axis and come into the focus at θ rather than 2θ. Since the
focus is a/2 from the mirror’s centre of curvature, such rays
are parallel to the normals to the primary mirror at the
points where they hit it. Since the focus is at a/2 beyond
the centre of curvature, the extrapolated rays from focus
meet the corresponding extrapolated incoming parallel rays
on a sphere a/2 behind the primary mirror. Thus the sphere
and the cardiod corrector give an example of a perfect focus
telescope obeying Abbe’s condition (see section 4). The ﬁnal
image is therefore free of coma. We explore this system in
another paper because it leads to very small correctors for
very fast spheres.

convergent rays are reﬂected glancingly from the outside of the
corrector and on reﬂection the rays have angles to the axis half
as great as those incident on the corrector. Only 62% of the light
is caught before the corrector’s surface gets in the way of the
incident light but the remaining 38% can be redirected to form a
separate focus. The sphere and trumpet corrector form the s =

Clearly any primary mirror will have a defocusing function,
but in this section we are interested in the inverse problem
of determining the shape of the primary mirror when defo-
cusing function x(θ) is known and is due to just the primary.

tice that this shape depends on the integration constant c1.
We may determine this by dividing (30) by tan 2θ and then
letting θ

with xp the position of the primary’s pole. The right hand
side becomes
x(0) + c1 so c1 = xp and the only parameter
is thus the position of the primary.

We found that U (θ) was preferable to x(θ) at least for
the speciﬁcation of the corrector. It is therefore of interest
to re-express the equations for the primary in terms of U (θ)
rather than x(θ). From (10)

A number of corrector mirrors for a fast sphere are illus-
trated in ﬁgure 2 a, b, c. The rays are drawn for the strangest
of these in ﬁgure 3. Just as for the secondary, the shape of
the primary is determined by U (θ) but it now needs also the
mirror separation. The parameter xf is needed only if we
want to locate the two–mirror system within our arbitrary
coordinate system. Thus U (θ) together with the separation
xp
xc speciﬁes the 2 mirrors. Notice that we can, if we so
wish, choose a coordinate system zeroed at ﬁnal focus, in
which case xf = 0 and that parameter vanishes from the
system.

−

Glancing incidence primaries can be included in the
same analysis by letting θ take the values between π/4 and
π/2.

We have shown that the uniting function U (θ) together with
the mirror separation determines the shapes of both mirrors.
We now show how the equal magniﬁcation or no coma con-
dition of Abbe can be used to determine U (θ). Abbe’s con-
dition (Abbe 1873) is that rays approaching the ﬁnal focus
when extrapolated back to meet their corresponding incom-
ing parallel rays must intersect them on a sphere centred at
the focus. In our notation this means

where b is the radius of the Abbe sphere which is the eﬀective
focal length of the optical system.

Rp = b sin φ

Theorem

In any two mirror telescope with no spherical aberration and
no coma, the angle of the rays to the axis after reﬂection in
the primary, 2θ, is related to the angle φ at which those rays
enter the ﬁnal focus by

Thus K determines the amount by which the focus lies

rector mirror to the ﬁnal focus and the mirror separation
both measured in terms of the eﬀective focal length b.

the theorem i.e., that which gives the mirror shapes.

5 SINGULARITIES ASYMPTOTES AND
CATASTROPHES IN THE MIRRORS

After equation (17) we commented that because the equa-
tions for the corrector mirror’s shape are parametric, cusps
and singularities can be expected. Indeed the general theory
of the shapes obtained when the parameters of parametric
equations are eliminated is called Catastrophe Theory and
not without reason. Poincar´e was the ﬁrst to develop it and
he applied it both in orbit theory and to the theory of ro-
tating liquid masses. More recently the theory was much
developed and elaborated by Thom, Zeeman and Arnold.
Both mirrors of the coma and spherical aberration free op-
tical systems are deﬁned by parametric equations so we can
expect cusps to occur at special points of each of our mir-
rors for some s, K values. Also it is quite possible for a
mathematically deﬁned mirror to reach out to inﬁnity and
to come back from the other direction as such asymptotes
are common in mathematics. In practice only a small part
of a mathematically designed mirror is made and much has
to be left out anyway to let the light see the pieces of mirror
that are to be used.

Since the special points where cusps or asymptotes oc-
cur in the mirror shapes can be determined from a study
of the equations that deﬁne the mirrors, we now step aside
from the main line of this paper to make such a study. Of
course it is possible just to draw the shapes of the mirrors
from the parametric equations and so discover the singu-
lar points merely by observation. Those less interested in
mathematics may be well advised to go straight to ﬁgure 4
which describes the special points encountered on the mir-
rors for each value of s and K. The theory that precedes that
ﬁgure allows the reader to understand why the boundaries
between mirrors with diﬀerent types of cusps or asymptotes
occur where they do in the s, K parameter space.

Rp = 2bT /(1 + T 2) maximises at b when T = 1, that is
φ = π/2. At that φ the rays approach the ﬁnal focus at right
angles to the axis. Now from (25) dXp/dT =
tdRp/dT so
dXp/dT is also zero at T = 1. Both Rp(T ) and Xp(T ) turn
back at the same point which makes a cusp in the primary
mirror. These cusps point in the direction of increasing x
when t(1) < 0 and decreasing x when t(1) > 0 where t(1) =

. Beyond this cusp the rays enter
2s
the ﬁnal focus backwards (φ > π/2) T > 1 and we refer to
the primary as having its second sheet, see Figure 5a. Since
Rp remains in the range 0 6 Rp 6 b for all T its radius is
always ﬁnite, however this does not mean that the mirror is
always ﬁnite because it can reach out to inﬁnity in directions
parallel to the axis. We may rewrite (37)

latter case gives a singular backward (x

axis for the primary’s second sheet when s > 1. The former
case also occurs on the second sheet since T 2 = η > 1. The
mirror then asymptotes to the cylinder Rp = 2bη1/2/(1 + η).
For K > 0 the mirror approaches this cylinder from the
outside (Rp decreasing) as T increases towards η and Xp

that range it is a sharp cusp with dRp/dXp = 0 there.

The corrector mirrors also have asymptotes unless
K/s > 0 with η negative (i.e., s outside the range 0 to
1). Since R/X = tan φ these asymptotes are caused as
and make cones with apices at the ﬁnal focus.
ρ
From (40) it seems as though there would be inﬁnities in ρ
when T 2 = η > 0, but from (35) we see that t has a com-
pensating inﬁnity there, so the only inﬁnities in ρ are when
tT is zero. Using (35) for t and the relation between s

and η these occur when

As stated earlier such asymptotes occur unless K/s is posi-
tive and η negative in which case the two sides have opposite
signs. All other cases have asymptotes.

The occurrence of cusps in the corrector mirror is best
considered in polar coordinates ρ, φ except that we use T =
tan φ/2 rather than φ. Combining equations (40) and (35)
we have the following expression for ρ(T ).

Figure 4. The diagram illustrates by diﬀerent shadings, which
sometimes overlap, the parts of the s, K plane of optical designs
in which the mirrors have diﬀerent types of singular behaviour.
For example a design with s < −1 and K < 0 will have both
a corrector mirror without singularities and a primary with a
cusp on the axis of its second sheet. This is why such designs
lie in regions in which the diagonal shading overlaps the dots in
squares pattern. The values of η = s/(1 − s) are given at the top
for convenience.

6 USE OF THE FORMULAE

Mathematics can be blind and misleading. We have not re-
quired that the light can get to the primary without hitting
the secondary, nor that the light can actually reach the fo-
cus. Some of the foci are virtual, sometimes it is only the
backward extrapolation of the ray that is reﬂected from the
primary that would have hit the secondary and been re-
ﬂected to the focus. Thus, while we have all useful spherical–
aberration–and–coma–free two mirror systems, we have to
cut away unused pieces of the mirrors to get them and along
with useful designs there are many useless ones. There is
no substitute for drawing the designs in detail, so that one
may ensure that the system can be baﬄed against stray
light. This is done in the companion paper by Willstrop and
Lynden-Bell (2002).

−

In ﬁgures 1–6 we assumed that the light came in from
the left initially, hit the primary to the right of the diagram,
and returned to hit the secondary. In applying the formu-
lae one ﬁnds that the two parameter set of designs is best
studied in the s
K plane and that when s is negative, the
light should be assumed to come in from the right instead.
However, we like to maintain the convention that the light
comes in from the left so we have left-right reversed ﬁgure 7.
Most of the good designs are perfect focus variants of
well known ones listed in Table 2 with the values of K and
s that give them. Figure 5 gives the s = 0.274, K = 0.335
perfect focus version Ritchey–Chr´etien telescope design. In
5a we have drawn just the mirrors for all values of T . The
primary mirror has the full line. Its proﬁle makes a strange
wiggle just prior to the edge cusp. The second sheet is reg-
ular and remains smooth on axis. The corrector is drawn

also has a wiggle but then asymptotes upper left to inﬁn-
ity reappearing lower right on its second sheet. This second
sheet meets the axis in a cusp (in accordance with ﬁgure
4). In ﬁgure 5b the paths of some representative rays are
illustrated. Clearly large parts of the secondary must be cut
away to let the light hit the primary. The ray at φ/2 = 2.25
radians is reﬂected away from focus by the secondary and so
gives only a virtual focus. The focus is marked by a larger
circle. In ﬁgures 5b, 6a and 7 the primary is represented by
a chain of small circles with every ﬁfth one larger and every
tenth ﬁlled in. The secondary is denoted by a chain of dots
with every ﬁfth a circle and every tenth ﬁlled. Virtual rays
are dashed.

In the lower half of Figure 5c just the useful parts of
the mirrors are shown along with a number of rays starting
at the plane X =
0.1, initially parallel to the axis, falling
on the primary and secondary mirrors in turn, and ending
at the focus at X = 0.0. In the upper half of Figure 5c are
four spot diagrams. At the left, we show the distribution of
rays on the primary mirror. The other three spot diagrams
are greatly enlarged, and show the computed distribution
of rays at the focus. In this case the image is on axis, and
all three of these spot diagrams are identical. Their size is
entirely due to the limited accuracy of our computer, which
uses double precision codes. The total spread of each image

Figure 6 gives a perfect focus version of the Bowen spec-
trograph camera while ﬁgure 7 gives a design in which rays
approach the ﬁnal focus over a full hemisphere. Such coma–
free designs are more suitable for solar furnaces or light-
house beams than they are for telescopes or spectrographs.
Superﬁcially similar designs are illustrated in Mertz
(1996) who says the relevant ﬁgure originated in the work of
Sebastian von Hoerner. However, on closer inspection, these
designs are correctors for a spherical primary and thus can-
not obey Abbe’s no coma condition exactly. In spite of this
these corrector designs for a sphere may be more practical
than those given here with an aspheric primary because the
corrector assembly can be moved to follow the sun for a
signiﬁcant time even if the spherical primary is ﬁxed. For
an aspheric primary such a movement would destroy the
spherical aberration correction. Mertz gives there a number
of other designs for solar furnaces.

There are also designs for systems which have either
primary or secondary of very low power. One of these gives
an all reﬂecting Schmidt which replaces Schmidt’s corrector
plate by a reﬂector which gives the returning rays just the

c(cid:13) 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–10

right corrections for the sphere. Only by turning a normal
Schmidt upside-down and punching a large hole in the spher-
ical mirror could any light enter this system and its eﬃciency
would then be very low. It may be that other ‘almost ﬂat’
mirrors could be better replaced by suitably ﬁgured glass
as in the real Schmidt. However, there are variants of the
Strand astrometric telescope at Flagstaﬀ that slightly ﬁgure
the ﬂat secondary and greatly improve the ﬁeld.

In the accompanying paper (Willstrop & Lynden-Bell,
2002), we describe how to use the parametric equations of
the mirrors to trace oﬀ axis rays. We also discuss the designs
found over the whole s
K plane from which the above are
a selection.

Figure 5.
a) Mirror proﬁles for the ‘perfect–focus’ version of a Ritchey–
Chr´etien system s = 0.274, K = 0.335. The two sheets of a
primary are drawn with a continuous line with second sheet on
the right. The corrector is drawn dashed and has an asymptote.
There is also a cusp on the axis of the corrector mirror’s second
sheet T −→ ∞.
b) As 5a with some rays drawn. That with φ/2 = 2.25 gives only
a virtual focus.
c) Parts of the mirrors used in the Anglo Australian Telescope.

Figure 6. a) The s = 2.0 K = 4.236 Perfect–Focus System gives
the Bowen spectrograph camera. Notice that the primary has an
asymptotic spike on axis of its second sheet and the corrector is
regular everywhere.
b) Ray paths and mirror parts used in the camera.

Figure 7. The s = 2.0, K = −0.1 Perfect–Focus System gives
a focus at which the rays enter over 2π steradians. Such systems
are suitable for solar furnaces.

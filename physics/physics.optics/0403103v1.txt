We reveal the existence of asymmetric vortex solitons in ideally symmetric periodic lattices, and
show how such nonlinear localized structures describing elementary circular ﬂows can be analyzed
systematically using the energy-balance relations. We present the examples of rhomboid, rectangular,
and triangular vortex solitons on a square lattice, and also describe novel coherent states where the
populations of clockwise and anti-clockwise vortex modes change periodically due to a nonlinearity-
induced momentum exchange through the lattice. Asymmetric vortex solitons are expected to
exist in diﬀerent nonlinear lattice systems including optically-induced photonic lattices, nonlinear
photonic crystals, and Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices.

Vortices are fundamental objects which appear in
many branches of physics [1]. In optics, vortices are as-
sociated with phase dislocations (or phase singularities)
carried by diﬀracting optical beams [2], and they share
many common properties with the vortices observed in
superﬂuids and Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) [3].
Vortices may emerge spontaneously or can be generated
by various experimental techniques, and they are impor-
tant objects for fundamental studies also having many
practical applications. Nonlinear self-action eﬀects are
inherent to many physical systems, and they support the
existence of localized vortex-like structures in the form of
vortex solitons when the ﬂow around the singularity does
not change the density distribution, the property natu-
rally observed for axially symmetric structures in homo-
geneous media [Fig. 1(a)].

Periodic lattices, such as photonic structures for laser
beams or optical lattices for atomic BECs, allow for a
strong modiﬁcation of the wave propagation, which also
depends on the energy density. Recently, it was demon-
strated experimentally that photonic lattices can support
stable oﬀ-site (small radius) and on-site (larger radius)
vortices on a square lattice [4]. The square-like proﬁles of
such vortices resemble a homogeneous vortex modulated
by the underlying periodic structure [Fig. 1(b)]. Vortex
solitons describe elementary circular energy ﬂows, and
therefore their properties are intrinsically linked to the
wave transport mechanisms in the underlying periodic
lattice.
In this Letter, we demonstrate that this con-
nection is highly nontrivial due to an interplay between
nonlinearity and periodicity. We predict analytically and
conﬁrm by numerical simulations that even ideally sym-
metric periodic structures can support robust asymmet-
ric vortex solitons, and our approach allows for a sys-
tematic study of such novel types of singular states. We
ﬁnd that some symmetries are always allowed, whereas
other conﬁgurations, such as a triangular vortex shown
in Fig. 1(c), may exist under certain conditions derived
from a balance of the energy ﬂows. Additionally, we pre-

tons in a periodic lattice. Arrows indicate the direction of the

dict the existence of fully coherent states in the form of
vortices which exhibit a charge ﬂipping, i.e. a periodic re-
versal of the energy ﬂow. This eﬀect can occur for larger-
radius vortices, uncovering a key diﬀerence between the
on-site and oﬀ-site vortex states.

We consider the nonlinear propagation of an optical
beam in a two-dimensional periodic lattice [5] described
by the dimensionless nonlinear equation,

i

∂Ψ
∂z

+ D∇⊥Ψ + V (x, y)Ψ − G(x, y, |Ψ|2)Ψ = 0,

(1)

where ∇⊥ stands for the transverse Laplacian, Ψ(x, y, z)
is the complex ﬁeld amplitude, x, y are the transverse
coordinates, z is the propagation coordinate, D is the
diﬀraction (or dispersion) coeﬃcient. Function V deﬁnes
a periodic potential of the two-dimensional lattice, and
the function G characterizes a nonlinear response. Sim-
ilar mathematical models appear for describing the self-
action eﬀects in nonlinear photonic crystals [6], and the
nonlinear dynamics of atomic BEC in optical lattices [7].
Nonlinearity in Eq. (1) can compensate for the
diﬀraction-induced beam spreading in the transverse di-
mensions leading to the formation of stationary struc-
tures in the form of spatial solitons, Ψ(x, y, z) =
ψ(x, y)eiβz, where ψ(x, y) is the soliton envelope, and

β is a nonlinear shift of the propagation constant, the
soliton parameter. Periodic lattices can modify dramat-
ically the soliton properties, as was demonstrated for
waveguide arrays and dynamically-induced periodic pho-
tonic lattices [5]. In particular, periodic lattices can sta-
bilize and support propagation of discrete vortex soli-
tons [8, 9, 10, 11] which have recently been observed in
experiment [4].

In order to analyze the vortex-like structures in a pe-
riodic potential, we write the ﬁeld envelope in the form,
ψ(x, y) = |ψ(x, y)| exp[iϕ(x, y)], and assume that the ac-
cumulation of the phase ϕ around a singular point (at
ψ = 0) is 2πM , where M is an integer topological charge.
We consider spatially localized structures in the form of
vortex-like bright solitons with the envelopes vanishing
at inﬁnity. Such structures can exist when the soliton
parameter β is placed inside a gap of the linear Floquet-
Bloch spectrum of the periodic structure [6, 7].

The proﬁles of four-lobe symmetric vortex solitons dis-
cussed so far in both the theory [8, 9, 10, 11] and ex-
periment [4] resemble closely a ring-like structure of the
soliton clusters [12] in homogeneous media. Then, we
look for novel vortex solitons of arbitrary symmetry as a
superposition of a number of the fundamental solitons,

Ψ(x, y; z) =

An(z)ψs(x − xn, y − yn)eiβz,

(2)

where ψs are the proﬁles of the individual fundamental
solitons, n = 0, . . . , N − 1, N is the total number of soli-
tons, (xn, yn) are the soliton positions, and An is the
scaling coeﬃcient deﬁning the phase of the n-th soliton
and variation of its amplitude due to interaction with
other solitons. In contrast to the case of a homogeneous
medium [12], the positions of the individual solitons are
ﬁxed by the lattice potential, provided the lattice poten-
tial is suﬃciently strong. In order to determine the soli-
ton amplitudes, we present Eq. (1) in the Hamiltonian
form, idΨ/dz = δH(x, y, Ψ, Ψ∗)/δΨ∗, and derive, after
substituting Eq. (2) into the full Hamiltonian, the re-
duced Hamiltonian Hs(x, y, An, A∗
n) . The resulting am-
plitude equations can be written in the form,

We note that the approximation (2) is valid when
cn6=m, G, F/An ∼ ε ≪ 1. As was demonstrated ear-
lier [13, 14], under such conditions the amplitudes An are
only slightly perturbed, and we can seek stationary solu-
tions of Eq. (3) corresponding to vortex solitons by means
of the perturbation theory: An = [1 + O(ε)] exp[iϕn +

portional to the forth-order overlap integrals and, there-

In the sum (4), each term deﬁnes the energy ﬂow between
the solitons with numbers n and m, so that the equa-
tions (4) represent a condition for a balance of the energy
ﬂows which is required for stable propagation of a soliton
cluster and the vortex-soliton formation. These condi-
tions are satisﬁed trivially when all the solitons are in- or
out-of-phase. We note that Eq. (3) with Fn ≡ 0 has the
form of a discrete self-trapping equation, which appears
in diﬀerent physical contexts [15, 16]. However, nontriv-
ial solutions of Eqs. (4) corresponding to the vortex-like
soliton clusters have been analyzed only for symmetric
conﬁgurations, and even then some important solutions
have been overlooked, as we demonstrate below. More-
over, we show that the existence domains of asymmetric
vortex-like solutions are highly nontrivial, due to speciﬁc
properties of the coupling coeﬃcients calculated for real-
istic periodic lattices.

In order to provide a direct link to the recent ex-
perimental results [4], ﬁrst we apply our general ana-
lytical approach to describe the vortex solitons in two-
dimensional optically-induced lattices created in a pho-
torefractive crystal. Then, the diﬀraction coeﬃcient in
Eq. (1) is deﬁned as D = z0λ/(4πn0x2
0), where x0 and
z0 are the characteristic length-scales in the transverse
and longitudinal spatial dimensions, respectively, n0 is
the average medium refractive index, and λ is the vac-
uum wavelength. The lattice potential and nonlinear
beam self-action eﬀect are both due to the photorefrac-
tive screening nonlinearity,

where γ is proportional to the external bias ﬁeld, Ib is
the dark irradiance, and I0 is the intensity of interfering
beams that induce a square lattice with the period d (see
details in Refs. [4, 17]).

We use nonlinear localized (soliton) solutions obtained
by using the ansatz (2) as initial conditions for a numer-
ical relaxation algorithm applied to the model (1),(5).
We start by considering a four-soliton vortex on a square
lattice [Fig. 2(a)]. The previously reported solutions
[Figs. 2(b,c)] have both the reﬂection and 90o rotational
symmetries, similar to the underlying lattice. Accord-
ingly, c01 = c12 = c23 = c30 and c02 = c13, and Eqs. (4)
have a nontrivial-phase solution with ϕn = nπ/2 corre-
sponding to a charge-one symmetric vortex. However,
our analytical approach allows us to predict more gen-
eral, reduced-symmetry vortex solitons when the 90o ro-

and ϕ3 + ϕ0 = ϕ1 + ϕ2. Since an inverse cosine function
has two branches, there exist four solutions correspond-
ing to two pairs of positively and negatively charged vor-
tices with diﬀerent positions of singularity. We ﬁnd that
the singularity is always shifted away from the center
of rectangle along its longer dimension, as illustrated in
Figs. 4(a,b). This happens due to a highly asymmetric
phase structure of the vortex, which in turn can lead to
deformations of the vortex intensity proﬁle resulting in a
trapezoid-like shape shown in Fig. 4(a).

various symmetries in a square lattice potential shown in (a).

tational symmetry is removed. In particular, we ﬁnd a
rhomboid conﬁguration that has a vortex charge with
ϕn = nπ/2 [Fig. 2(d)]. We found that rhomboid vortices
are remarkably robust suggesting that their generation in
experiment can be possible by using elliptically shaped
singular beams.

Most remarkably, for both square and rhomboid con-
ﬁgurations, we ﬁnd that the balance equations (4) admit
more general exact solutions, which were overlooked in
the earlier studies [15] of Eq. (3), namely ϕ0 = ϕ2 − π
and ϕ1 = ϕ3 − π, where the phase diﬀerence ϕ1 − ϕ0
is arbitrary. These novel solutions describe a family of
vortex solitons having the same intensity proﬁle but dif-
ferent phase structure. Due to such a degeneracy, a small
change in the amplitude of two opposing solitons can ini-
tiate a slow variation of the free phase, ϕ1 − ϕ0 ≃ κz;
this regime corresponds to a periodic ﬂipping of the vor-
tex charge. Although the general equations (3) are only
satisﬁed when ϕ1−ϕ0 = 0, π/2, . . ., the charge-ﬂipping ef-
fect can be induced by a ﬁnite perturbation when the the
nonlinear coupling terms (Fn) are small. Indeed, we ﬁnd
that a closely packed vortex-like state shown in Fig. 2(b)
is resistant to the charge ﬂipping eﬀect, similar to vortices
in single-well potentials [18], whereas the vortex shown
in Fig. 2(c) can exhibit the charge ﬂipping after increas-
ing the amplitudes of two opposing solitons by 7%, as
shown in Fig. 3. The bottom plot clearly illustrates that
the solitons strongly exchange energy, however the ﬂows
always remain balanced. These are novel coherent states,
where the populations of clockwise and anti-clockwise ro-
tational modes change periodically due to nonlinearity-
induced momentum exchange through the lattice.

We now consider another example, vortices with rect-
angular arrangement of the fundamental solitons. In this
case, c01 = c23, c03 = c12, and c02 = c13. With no loss
of generality, we assign the soliton numbers such that
c01 ≤ c03, and then nontrivial solutions of Eqs. (4) are:
ϕ1 − ϕ0 = cos−1(−c02/c03), ϕ2 − ϕ0 = cos−1(−c01/c03),

corresponding to marked points in plots (a,c) (β = 2.5).

Finally, we mention another remarkable example of
asymmetric vortex solitons in the form of a triangular
structure. We ﬁnd that Eqs. (4) possess nontrivial so-
lutions for N = 3 only when the normalized coupling
coeﬃcients, c1 = c12/c01 and c2 = c02/c01, satisfy the fol-
lowing conditions, (1 + |c1|−1)−1 < |c2| < |1 − |c1|−1|−1,
and we show the existence domain in Fig. 5(a). It fol-
lows that highly asymmetric triangular vortices are not
allowed. On the other hand, isosceles conﬁgurations are
always possible if the soliton base is suﬃciently narrow,
so that condition c1 = c2 < 2 is satisﬁed. We show an
example of such vortex soliton in Fig. 5(b).

In order to underline the generality and broad applica-
bility of our results, we also search for asymmetric vor-
tex solitons in repulsive atomic Bose-Einstein conden-
sates loaded onto a two-dimensional optical lattice.
In
the mean-ﬁeld approximation, this system is described
by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (1) with

2
V = V0[sin(πx/d) + sin(πy/d)]; G = γ|Ψ|

,

(6)

where γ > 0, and V0 is the depth of an optical-lattice
potential. Repulsive nonlinearity can lead to wave lo-
calization in the form of gap solitons [7], which exhibit
eﬀective long-range interaction. This allows, in particu-
lar, the existence of triangular vortices with a wider base

4

[Fig. 5(d)] compared to the conventional solitons in the
self-focusing regime [cf. Fig. 5(b)]. We ﬁnd that such tri-
angular gap vortices exist throughout the whole band-gap
since c1 = c2 < 2 [Fig. 5(c)], except for the immediate
vicinity of the spectrum band edges where our approxi-
mation (2) is not applicable.

In addition, we have veriﬁed that all vortex-like struc-
tures discussed above are created by strongly coupled soli-
tons. This is an important issue, since it may be formally
possible to construct various composite states of almost
decoupled solitons, which exchange the energy at an ex-
tremely slow rate, so that Eqs. (4) are nearly satisﬁed.
In contrast, in the cases discussed above there is a strong
internal energy ﬂow within the phase-locked and charge-
ﬂipping vortices, as seen in Fig. 2 to Fig. 5.

In conclusion, we have revealed that periodic lattices
can support diﬀerent types of robust asymmetric vortex-
like nonlinear localized structures. Such vortices resem-
ble the soliton clusters trapped by the lattice, but they
are associated with a non-trivial power ﬂow. We have
presented the examples of novel vortex solitons on a
square lattice, and other solutions can be obtained and
analyzed using the general energy-balance relations. We
believe our ﬁndings will initiate the experimental eﬀorts
to observe such vortices in optically-induced photonic
structures, Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices,
photonic crystals, and photonic crystal ﬁbers.

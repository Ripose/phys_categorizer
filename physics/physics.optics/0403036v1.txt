Résumé

We onsider the magneto-eletri optial properties of the quantum vauum and show that all the di(cid:27)erent

phenomenona are related by Lorentz invariane. As a model alulation we show how rossed (cid:28)elds properties

an be alulated starting from single (cid:28)eld properties by using Lorentz transformations. Using this method

we have studied for the (cid:28)rst time the ase of a rossed stati magneti (cid:28)eld and eletri (cid:28)eld applied with one

of these two (cid:28)elds parallel to the diretion of light propagation. We also show that parallel (cid:28)eld properties

an be found using general symmetry properties.

Introdution

Several new magneto-eletri optial phenomena in entrosymmetri media have reently been observed for

the (cid:28)rst time [1℄ [2℄ [3℄. When a stati magneti (cid:28)eld

B0 and eletri (cid:28)eld

E0 are applied perpendiular to eah

other and to the propagation vetor of the light

, the existene of magneto-eletri linear birefringene [2℄, and

the existene of a polarization-independent anisotropy, proportional to

B0 × E0 [3℄ have been proven. When, on
E0 are parallel, the existene of magneto-eletri Jones birefringene was demonstrated

B0 and

the other hand,

for the (cid:28)rst time [1℄.

The most elementary entrosymmetri medium is the quantum vauum. Non-linear optial phenomena in

vauum have been predited sine 1935 [4℄ in the framework of quantum eletrodynamis [5℄ [6℄. In partiu-

lar, the existene in the vauum of a linear birefringene indued by a transverse stati magneti (cid:28)eld (the

Cotton-Mouton e(cid:27)et), or by a transverse stati eletri (cid:28)eld (the Kerr e(cid:27)et), has been predited [7℄, but

not yet observed. Reently, magneto-eletri linear birefringene, magneto-eletri Jones birefringene [8℄ and

polarization-independent magneto-eletri anisotropy [9℄ have also been predited for the quantum vauum.

Here we perform a omplete study of the magneto-eletro-optial properties of the quantum vauum using

Lorentz invariane. Using a suggestion by the authors of Ref. [3℄, we relate single (cid:28)eld properties to rossed

(cid:28)eld properties like magneto-eletri anisotropy. This method is based on the magneti (eletri) (cid:28)eld behavior

under Lorentz transformation that allows us to look for an appropriate referene frame in whih the two rossed

(cid:28)elds are transformed into only one (cid:28)eld. In this referene frame the only existing e(cid:27)et is a magneti (eletri)

linear birefringene whose harateristi values of index of refration are known. These refrative index values

an be transformed bak to the laboratory frame values by using the well-known result of the eletrodynamis

of moving media, as e.g. used to desribe Fizeau's experiment [5℄. This method is ideally suited for the quantum

vauum sine it is invariant under Lorentz transformation, and one an alulate the analytial value of the

refrative index in any referene frame.

Magneto-eletro-optis of the quantum vauum

With this method, we reprodue in a straightforward way the results, obtained in previous publiations by

more elaborate alulations, onerning magneto-eletri birefringenes, and polarization-independent anisotropy,

1

proportional to

B0 × E0 . The ase where a stati magneti (cid:28)eld

B0 and a stati eletri (cid:28)eld

E0 are simulta-

neously applied perpendiular to eah other but with one of these two stati (cid:28)elds parallel to the diretion of

propagation has never been treated before. Here we demonstrate for the (cid:28)rst time that only the (cid:28)eld perpendi-

ular to the diretion of propagation gives an e(cid:27)et and that no bilinear phenomenon exists for this geometry. In

the same ontext we also examine the ase of both (cid:28)elds parallel to the diretion of propagation. By symmetry

arguments we relate parallel (cid:28)elds properties to rossed (cid:28)elds properties and show that no e(cid:27)et exists for this

geometry.

The starting point of any alulation of the propagation of light in the quantum vauum [8℄, [9℄ is the

Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian [10℄. The form of the e(cid:27)etive Lagrangian LHE of the eletromagneti interation

is essentially determined by the fat that the Lagrangian has to be relativisti and CPT invariant and therefore

an only be a funtion of the Lorentz invariants [11℄ F, G that in Heaviside-Lorentz units an be written as

F = (E2 − B2)

G = (E · B)

LHE = L0 +

(aF 2 + bG2)

term

Up to seond order in the (cid:28)elds, LHE an be written as LHE = L0 + LEK where L0 is the usual Maxwell`s
1
2 F and LEK is the (cid:28)rst order non linear term (cid:28)rst alulated by Euler and Kokel [4℄. LEK is valid in the
approximation that the (cid:28)elds vary slowly over the Compton wavelength of the eletron λ = ~/mec and during
ec3/e~ i.e. B ≪ 4.4 × 109
a time te =λ/c . Moreover E and B have to be smaller than the ritial (cid:28)eld Ecr = m2
T and E ≪ 1.3 × 1018

V/m. LHE an be written in Heaviside-Lorentz units as

A term proportional to F G is Lorentz invariant but not CPT invariant and therefore does not appear in the
expression of LEK . Higher order terms of LHE an be written in the same way by looking for ombinations of
the two invariants F and G that also respet CPT. In the ase of a plane wave in vauum, both F and G are

equal to zero. The propagation of a plane wave in vauum is thereby not a(cid:27)eted by non linear interations

sine LHE = 0.

The values of a and b are provided by QED. The alulation by Heisenberg and Euler gives a = e4~/45πm4c7 =
B0 , we showed

2.67 10−32 G−2
in Ref. [8℄ the existene of a Cotton-Mouton birefringene ∆nCM ∝ B2
0 and a
magneto-eletri linear birefringene ∆nMELB ∝ E0B0 . In Ref. [9℄ we also showed the existene of a magneto-
eletri anisotropy, independent of polarization, ∆nMEA whih is also proportional to E0B0 . In the ase of

and b = 7a. Based on this Lagrangian, in the ase of rossed stati (cid:28)elds

0 , a Kerr birefringene ∆nK ∝ E2

E0 and

parallel stati (cid:28)elds we also showed in Ref. [8℄ the existene of a magneto-eletri Jones birefringene orre-

sponding to a ∆nJ ∝ E0B0 . Faraday and Pokel e(cid:27)ets are not permitted in vauum sine no terms ontaining

three eletromagneti (cid:28)elds exist in the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian. As far as we know, the ase of rossed

eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds with one of the two parallel to the diretion of propagation of light has never been

treated, neither in vauum, nor in any other medium. All the e(cid:27)ets predited for the quantum vauum have

been observed in entrosymmetri media. The quantum vauum behaves exatly like any other entrosymmetri

medium. The predited values for all these e(cid:27)ets in vauum are unfortunately so small that observation has

not yet been possible.

For our purpose, we just need to suppose that when a stati magneti (cid:28)eld

B0 is present in a vauum,

perpendiular to the diretion of light propagation, the light veloity hanges in suh a way that

nk = 1 + ηkB2

0

and

n⊥ = 1 + η⊥B2
where nk and n⊥ are the index of refration for light polarized parallel and orthogonal to the stati magneti
(cid:28)eld, respetively. Sine the veloity of light has to be smaller than c, ηk and η⊥ are positive.

The ase of two rossed (cid:28)elds

E0 and

B0 an be ompletely solved by an appropriate Lorentz transformation

thanks to the Lorentz invariane of the quantum vauum. Using Lorentz transformations one an express the

Light polarization in a moving medium

We are interested in e(cid:27)ets that depend on the polarization of light. We therefore have to study how the

polarization of light is transformed going from frame K to frame K
in K when no external (cid:28)elds are present and reall that the quantities E2 − B2
Lorentz transformation. For a plane wave in vauum Eω = Bω and
(cid:28)elds. Sine E2
in K

Eω · Bω are equal to zero in K , they are also equal to zero in K
E0 and

Eω · Bω = 0 where

ω − B2

E · B

ω and

we still have a plane wave. If in addition, stati

′

and

′

B0 (cid:28)elds are also present, the total (cid:28)elds an be
B = B0 + Bω . Using the linearity of Eqs. 6 and 7 with respet to the (cid:28)elds, it is

. This means that

written as

E = E0 + Eω and

are invariant under

Eω, Bω are the optial

. We (cid:28)rst onsider the ase of a plane wave

′

straightforward to show that

where

ω and

ω are the transformations of the optial (cid:28)elds alone. We an therefore onlude that the optial

(cid:28)elds transform as if no external (cid:28)eld were present and thus a plane wave in K remains a plane wave in K

′

.

Eω and

Let's now investigate how the orientation of

If for example

Let's (cid:28)nally alulate the value of n using the expressions derived in the previous paragraphs. We onsider
E0 × B0 and

E0⊥B0 and assume for the moment that E0 < B0 and that
v

k

′

, the only existing e(cid:27)et is a Cotton-Mouton e(cid:27)et proportional to the

the situation when

depends on the polarization of light. Thanks to eqs. 4, 5, we an write that

δn′

k = ηkB′2

0 = ηk(1 − β

2

2
)B
0

and, using Eq. 15,

E0 and

sine

δnk = ηk(1 − β)2B2
B0 are perpendiular. For the same reason, we an write

0 = ηk(B2

0 − 2E0B0 + E2
0 )

δn⊥ = η⊥(1 − β)2B2

0 = η⊥(B2

0 − 2E0B0 + E2
0 )

So if ηk 6= η⊥ i.e. if the Cotton-Mouton e(cid:27)et exists, we have demonstrated that the Kerr e(cid:27)et and the
magneto-eletri birefringene proportional to E0B0 must also exist. Moreover, beause of Lorentz invariane,

Kerr birefringene has to be of opposite sign ompared to the Cotton-Mouton one sine light retardation is

equal for light polarized parallel to the B0 (cid:28)eld and orthogonal to the

E0 (cid:28)eld and vie versa. As for magneto-

eletri birefringene, the oe(cid:30)ient that multiplies the (cid:28)elds is twie the one of the Cotton-Mouton or Kerr

Let's now ome to the polarization-independent magneto-eletri anisotropy. If we write ηk = η⊥ + ∆ we

(cid:28)nd that light is retarded by the existene of the stati (cid:28)elds independently of the polarization by a quantity

birefringene.

If we hange

δn0(k) − δn0(−k) = −4η⊥E0B0

For the ase when B0 < E0 , one obtains exatly the same results and they are idential to those that we
have obtained in ref. [8℄ and that we have omplemented in ref. [9℄ where we have used for ηk and η⊥ the

aepted values. We stress that the existene of the magneto-eletri anisotropy is only related to the fat

that η⊥ is di(cid:27)erent from zero. This e(cid:27)et ould exist even if the Cotton-Mouton e(cid:27)et would not exist, as the
Cotton-Mouton e(cid:27)et exists only if ∆ is di(cid:27)erent from zero, independent of the value of η⊥ .

We (cid:28)nally study the ase when E0 = B0 . If

k

is parallel to

E0 × B0 , δnk = δn⊥ = 0. This result is somewhat

obvious sine this ase orresponds to the propagation of a plane wave in the (cid:28)eld of a o-propagating plane

wave. If

is antiparallel to

k

E0 × B0 , the e(cid:27)et is not zero. This means that two ounterpropagating plane waves

an a(cid:27)et eah other.

We note that ηk and η⊥ are diretly related to the oe(cid:30)ients of the invariants F 2
2 and η⊥ = 2a and, for the Cotton Mouton e(cid:27)et, we have

The ase of

show in the following how we an solve it using our method. Let's assume that E0 < B0 and onsider

v

B′

0 is no more

ollinear with the diretion of propagation of light. In this frame, only the Cotton-Mouton e(cid:27)et an exist, and

Therefore only the Kerr e(cid:27)et exists for this ase. Let's now onsider the ase E0 > B0 . The resulting

Parallel (cid:28)elds geometry

To omplete our analysis, we onsider the geometry where the two (cid:28)elds

other. The ase in whih the two (cid:28)elds are perpendiular to the

vetor of light has been studied in detail

by Ross, Sherborne and Stedman in ref. [15℄. These authors proved by symmetry onsiderations that in this

on(cid:28)guration, magneto-eletri Jones birefringene should exist and that it should have the same magnitude as

the magneto-eletri linear birefringene in rossed (cid:28)elds. The two e(cid:27)ets are atually two di(cid:27)erent faets of the

same phenomenon.

What has not been studied yet is the ase where the two parallel (cid:28)elds are parallel to the

vetor. We will

k

show that no bilinear e(cid:27)et exists for this geometry. First assume that suh an e(cid:27)et exists i.e.

B0 and

E0 are parallel to eah

k

Let's regard the two (cid:28)elds in a K ′

referene frame moving at a veloity β in the diretion of

k

. Using equations

6 and 7, one an show that

Using equation 15 we must then onlude that

Sine β an take any value between 0 and 1,this is in disagreement with our starting assumption, unless η is

equal to zero. Thus the two parallel (cid:28)elds in the diretion of

give no bilinear e(cid:27)et.

We have shown that the magneto(cid:21)eletri optial properties of the quantum vauum an be dedued from

the priniple of Lorentz invariane. We have reprodued in a straightforward manner theoretial results obtained

by muh more elaborate methods, and have also onsidered new geometries, never treated before. In partiular

we have found the new result that in rossed stati eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds, a stati omponent parallel

to the propagation of light does not give rise to an optial e(cid:27)et. Although our method ould also be applied

to material media, it is less onvenient there, as one also has to take into aount the transformations of the

Nonlinear optical media that are normally dispersive, support a new type of localized (non-
diﬀractive and nondispersive) wavepackets that are X-shaped in space and time and have slower
than exponential decay. High-intensity X-waves, unlike linear ones, can be formed spontaneously
through a trigger mechanism of conical emission, thus playing an important role in experiments.

The nonlinear response of condensed matter can com-
pensate for the diﬀractive spreading of optical beams, or
the dispersive broadening of pulses due to group-velocity
dispersion (GVD), forming spatial [1] or temporal soli-
tons [2], respectively. Recent experimental results con-
cerning the self-focusing behavior of intense ultrashort
pulses [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] indicate, however, that the spa-
tial and temporal degrees of freedom cannot be treated
separately. When the three length scales naturally asso-
ciated with diﬀraction, GVD, and nonlinearity become
comparable, the most intriguing consequence of space-
time coupling is the possibility to form a nondiﬀractive
and nondispersive localized wavepacket (LWP), namely
a spatio-temporal soliton or light bullet [9] characterized
by exponentially decaying tails. A strict constraint for
the formation of light bullets is that the nonlinear phase
changes counteract both the linear wavefront curvature
and the GVD-induced chirp, leading to space-time focus-
ing, as occuring in Kerr-like focusing media with anoma-
lous GVD [5, 7].

Viceversa, a normal GVD rules out the possibility to
achieve bullet-type LWPs. In this regime, the ﬁeld evo-
lution is known to be qualitatively diﬀerent, and involves
complex phenomena such as temporal splitting and spec-
tral breaking [3, 4, 7]. This is the reason why no attempts
have been made to answer the fundamental question as
to whether any form of nonlinearity-induced localization
could still take place in normally dispersive media.
In
this letter, we show that LWPs do exist also with normal
GVD in the form of nonlinear X-waves (NLXWs) or X-
wave solitons. To date X-shaped waves are known only
in the context of linear acoustic [10], or electromagnetic
[11] propagation, and constitute the polichromatic gener-
alization of diﬀraction-free Bessel (or Durnin [12]) beams.
They have been observed in both acoustical [13] and op-
tical [14] experiments, both requiring beam-shaping tech-
niques. Here, we ﬁnd propagation-invariant NLXWs that
can be naturally regarded as the continuation of linear
X-waves into the nonlinear regime. Yet, we ﬁnd one
fundamental diﬀerence between linear and NLXWs. At

high intensity, the formation of X-shaped LWPs occurs
spontaneously from conventional bell-shaped (in space
and time) beams throughself-induced spectral reshaping
triggered by a mechanism of conic al emission. Thus,
NLXWs are expected to have stronger impact on experi-
ments than linear X waves.

To support the generality of NLXW concept, we
choose two diﬀerent phenomena, whose spatio-temporal
dynamics have been widely investigated experimentally.
Speciﬁcally, we consider self-action of a scalar wavepacket
u1 (carrier ω0) due to a pure (cubic) focusing Kerr ef-
fect, or generation of a u2 wavepacket at second-harmonic
(SH, 2ω0) in non-centrosymmetric (quadratic) media. In
the paraxial regime, the evolution in Kerr media is ruled
by the scalar 1+3 nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation,

While the anomalous GVD regime (Dm < 0) guaran-
tees that, for β < 0 (b, α < 0), nearly separable LWPs
(light bullets) exist with exponentially decaying tails, in
the normal GVD regime (Dm > 0) the nature of the
LWP solutions (if any) must change dramatically, be-
cause the low-intensity exponential damping no longer
takes place. Pseudo-spectral numerical techniques (i.e.,
solve Eqs. (3-4) as a dynamical evolution problem in r
with appropriate discretization in t [15]) are well suited to
search for strongly nonseparable objects with slow spatio-
temporal decay. We have implemented such methods
(using two diﬀerent algorithms), and found LWPs when

smaller ∆, the stronger the localization. The LWP solu-
tions, obtained from Eq. (3) with ∆ = 1 in Eq. (5) are
shown in Fig. 1. For b = 0 and moderate nonlinearities

In the case b = 1, while the ﬁeld maintains its basic X-
shape, it develops radial (damped) oscillations as shown

both of oscillatory type (b = 1, α
= 0, with out-of-phase
coherent oscillation), an example of the latter case being
shown in Fig. 2.

In both nonlinear processes the oscillations stem from
the fact that the spatial behavior of the low-intensity
portion of the LWPs is governed by a zero-th order
Bessel equation, which can be easily obtained by Fourier-
transforming the linear (γ = 0) limit of Eq. (3) or (de-
coupled) Eqs. (4). Therefore NLXWs exhibit the char-
acteristic damped spatial oscillations of J0 Bessel func-
tions, and can be regarded as the natural generalization
of monochromatic nondiﬀractive conical J0 beams, whose
physical realization was demonstrated both in the linear
[12] and nonlinear [16] regimes. More precisely, once the
NLXW solutions fm = fm(r, t) are obtained, they can be
represented in the spectral domain of transverse wavevec-
tor K = (K 2

Compared with their counterpart in the anomalous
GVD regime (i.e., 1+3D bullet LWP), NLXWs possess
important diﬀerences: (i) NLXWs experience weaker lo-

Γ = 0; (iii) NLXWs are not unique, in the sense that
iniﬁnitely many solutions can be found for ﬁxed β and
Γ. This follows also from (ii) since also linear paraxial X-
waves are a continuous family, e.g. parametrized by ∆ in
Eq. (5); (iv) NLXWs and bullets exist for diﬀerent sign
of β, entailing opposite phase shifts in Kerr media, and
δk/2 for NLXWs, β < δk/2

Once the existence of nonlinear LWPs supported by
normal GVD is established, one might wonder about
their importance and observability. In the linear regime,
both Durnin J0 beams [12] and nonmonochromatic X-
shaped LWPs [14] can be observed only by means of
experimental arrangements that adapt the input to the

LWP (e.g., by means of lensacons or axicons). Vice-
versa, we have found that the interplay of the non-
linearity and normal GVD is responsible for a univer-
sal mechanism, namely colored conical emission (CE),
that allows for the self-induced spectral (in Ω-K) re-
shaping necessary to turn conventional, e.g. gaussian,
pulsed beams into X-waves.
In fact, it is known that
in Kerr media [17] the (modulational) stability analy-
sis of the cw plane-wave solution u = eiΓζ of Eq. (1)
yields exponential ampliﬁcation of conical plane-wave
(or Bessel) perturbations with wavevector K and fre-
quency detuning Ω, such to yield real values of gain
1/2. This analysis can be

m = 1, 2. In the normal GVD regime (dm > 0) these
expressions entail CE, i.e. preferential ampliﬁcation of
waves at K (angles) linearly increasing with frequency
detuning. By comparing (see Fig. 3) the CE gain with
the NLXW spectrum, obtained by inverting Eq. (6), it is
clear that the instability provides ampliﬁcation at K
Ω
pairs that favour the formation of NLXWs. Although the
stability analysis is carried out for cw plane-wave pum-
ping beams, CE occurs also from tightly-focused short-
pulse input beams [17]. In this case, we expect CE to
amplify frequencies K
Ω contained in the broad in-
put spectrum, while preserving the phase coherence be-
tween diﬀerent spectral components necessary for the
formation of a NLXW. In order to support this con-
jecture and prove that NLXWs are the key to under-
stand the dynamics of experiments carried out with nar-
row beams and short pulses in the normal GVD regime,
we have conducted numerical simulations of the propa-
gation. This is crucial also to assess the observability
of such type of LWPs with ﬁnite-energy, which are the
nonlinear counterpart of monochromatic ﬁnite-aperture
J0 [12] or Bessel-Gauss beams, and nonmonochromatic
ﬁnite-energy linear X-waves [13, 14], observable in the
real world. While extensive results will be reported else-
where, we focus speciﬁcally on quadratic media [Eqs. (2)]
in the large negative mismatch limit, where the ﬁeld u1
plays a leading role, and experiences an eﬀective focus-
ing Kerr eﬀect [1, 5]. This case has twofold relevance:
(i) higher-order eﬀects not included in our models (Ra-
man, self-steepening, space-time coupling, saturation,
etc.) have lesser impact on the propagation as com-
pared with true Kerr media; (ii) experimental results in

Lithium Triborate (LBO) indicates the occurence of pulse
compression in spite of the fact that the medium is nor-
mally dispersive [19]. We model the latter case assuming

2 = 0.07 ps2/m,
χ2
30 cm−1 (δk =
180), and a spatio-
a mismatch ∆k =
temporal input gaussian beam u1(Z = 0) with FWHM
170 fsec duration and 65 µm beam width. Figure 4 (top
panel) shows the output intensity in a 4 cm crystal, in
the GVM-matched case (λ = 1.3µm, T = 35 C in LBO)
2
for an intensity Ip = 50 GW/cm
(Znl = 0.6 mm). As
shown, while a moderate fraction of the energy lags be-
hind and in front in the form of pulse satellites, the main
portion of the beam develops the characteristic structure
of a NLXW. Importantly, we observe that the forma-
tion of NLXW-type of LWPs in Fig. 4 is accompanied by
strong pulse compression. In fact, it can be shown that
the peculiar spatio-temporal structure of a NLXW leads
to an eﬀective GVD, which we obtain in the form k′′

Therefore the dispersive contribution which stems from

NLXWs are robust also against strong GVM. First,
when v
= 0 in Eqs. (2), we ﬁnd CE as well as NLXW
solutions of Eqs. (2) characterized by an additional com-
plex phase proﬁle (details will be given elsewhere). On
the other hand, our simulations show that, at suﬃciently
high intensity, after a short distance, the launched (u1)
and generated (u2) ﬁelds tend to develop spontaneously
NLXW shapes, meanwhile leading to nonlinear walk-oﬀ
compensation (u1,2 travel locked together). For instance
2 ob-
in Fig. 4 (bottom panel) we show the proﬁle

tained for an input intensity Ip = 70 GW/cm2 after 1.5
mm propagation in LBO at λ = 1.06µm, where a GVM
as large as δV = 45 ps/m (v = 75) is compensated.

Our results show that, contrary to common belief, non-
linear space-time localization takes place also in normally
dispersive media. NLXWs are the eigenmodes of 1+3D
paraxial wave propagation models, and will be central to
interpret correctly numerical and experimental results.
Having restricted ourselves to NLXWs that travel at the
natural group-velocity of light, further work will be de-
voted to search for NLXW solutions with ﬁnite energy (of
which we have given numerical evidence), and/or sub- or
super-luminal nature, as well as the role played by non-
paraxiality and higher-order nonlinear terms.

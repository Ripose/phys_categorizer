Abstract

A new type of perturbative expansion is built in order to give a rigorous derivation
and to clarify the range of validity of some commonly used model equations. This
model describes the evolution of the modulation of two short and localized pulses,
fundamental and second harmonic, propagating together in a bulk uniaxial crystal with
non-vanishing second order susceptibility χ(2), and interacting through the nonlinear
eﬀect known as “cascading” in nonlinear optics. The perturbative method mixes
a multi-scale expansion with a power series expansion of the susceptibility, and must
be carefully adapted to the physical situation.
It allows the determination of the
physical conditions under which the model is valid: the order of magnitude of the
walk-oﬀ, phase-mismatch, and anisotropy must have determined values.

Introduction

1.1 A methodological problem

Many scientists, in recent times, came to the idea that physics is intrinsically nonlinear and
that most of the linear theories have been introduced because they were mathematically
tractable, contrarily to the nonlinear problems. Nowadays, the theoreticians of nonlinear
physics almost always try to keep the largest part of the ideas involved by the linear theories
of the physical problems considered. Both mathematical tools and physical concepts are
conserved. The nonlinear theory appears then mainly as a perturbative approach in which
the linear theory is the zero order. As an essential example, the Fourier theory and
the plane monochromatic wave concept are the main tools in the linear theory of wave
propagation. The theory of nonlinear wave propagation considers some wave packet, that
is in fact a monochromatic plane wave (i.e. the linear wave) modulated by some slowly
varying envelope (which is thus some ﬁrst correction to the linear theory). This theory
involves thus at least two space scales: that of the wavelength and that of the pulse
length, which are treated separately by the mathematical model. The natural frame for
the derivation of the nonlinear models is thus the so-called multiscale expansion method.
From the mathematical viewpoint, formal computations in this frame can be performed

in a perfectly rigorous way. Convergence proofs have also been given [5]. They enhance
and clarify the validity of the formal computations.

A multiscale expansion, as well as any asymptotic expansion, has a structural drawback.
It involves some small parameter ε, that is inﬁnitely small in the mathematical theory,
while it takes a small but ﬁnite value in the physical applications. Consider then some
physical quantity, small in relation to the physical value of ε, but independent of it.
Because it is ﬁnite while ε is not, the mathematical theory considers it de facto as if it
were large in relation to ε. This may sometimes introduce erroneous results, in so far that
some further approximation is not taken into account. To introduce, beside the slowly
varying envelope approximation and mixed to it, a further approximation of another type
yields great technical diﬃculties. Such an approach mixing a multiscale expansion to an
approximation of another type has already been done for the treatment of damping for
soliton propagation, in particular for electromagnetic waves in ferromagnets [15, 10]. The
damping parameter is identiﬁed to some power of the perturbative parameter ε, and all
involved quantities are expanded in a power series of the damping constant.

In other situations, the ansatz must be constructed through a careful analysis of the
physical situation. We study in this paper a situation in which such a mixed expansion is
needed. It is presented from a methodological point of view, and should be of interest for
the readers who intend to apply the same kind of perturbative approach to other physical
situations. The proper physical consequences of the result will be published elsewhere [13].

1.2 Solitons through cascading

The physical situation we consider is the propagation of optical solitons using the so-
called cascading phenomenon, viz. second-harmonic generation and back-conversion to
the fundamental, that arises in a dielectric medium with a non-vanishing second-order
nonlinear susceptibility χ(2). Several theoretical results have been published in order to
show that this phenomenon could be responsible for the stabilization of a short pulse
and for solitonic behavior [1, 9, 14, 16]. These theoretical works study by analytic and
numerical methods some partial diﬀerential system, derived in the frame of the slowly
varying envelope approximation, and analogous in its form to the nonlinear Schr¨odinger
(NLS) equation, at least for the linear part. The nonlinear part of this system gives account
for the interaction between the fundamental and the second harmonic. Some applications
of this model have been found in good agreement with experimental results. However, the
way it is derived in the literature is quite phenomenological. It appears thus to be worth
giving a rigorous formal derivation of that model, and to clarify its range of validity.

Two waves propagating together are considered here, and their interaction is expected
to stabilize the pulse. Therefore two conditions must be satisﬁed, at least in an approxi-
mate way. First the interaction must be resonant, thus the waves must be phase-matched.
If not the interaction will not be strong enough to yield the expected eﬀect. Second the
two waves must propagate together during a long enough time. Thus their group veloci-
ties must be equal, or at least very close together. We determine precisely the order of
magnitude of the allowed small deviation from phase-matching and small walk-oﬀ. We
restrict for technical reasons our attention to crystals having some particular symmetry.
However, the required phase and group velocity matching conditions cannot be realized in
any crystal of this type: the linear dispersion relation of the material must satisfy several

128

H Leblond

conditions. The order of magnitude of some physical quantities must be comparable to
powers of the perturbative parameter characteristic of the multiscale expansion.

2 Analysis of the physical problem

2.1 The equations for a uniaxial optical crystal

We consider a bulk crystal with a non-zero second order susceptibility (χ(2)) tensor, opti-
cally uniaxial from the linear point of view and perfectly transparent. These hypotheses
are satisﬁed by potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) and analogous materials or by
lithium niobate, as examples. Wave propagation in such a medium is described by the
Maxwell equations that reduce to

no(ω) and ne(ω) are called respectively the ordinary and extraordinary indices [2]. A wave
propagates along the optical axis with the velocity c/no. If the propagation direction makes
some nonzero angle θ with this axis, two waves can propagate, with diﬀerent speeds and
polarizations. They are referred to as ordinary and extraordinary waves. The charac-
teristic feature of the extraordinary wave is that its group velocity is not parallel to its
phase velocity, which never happens in isotropic media. If θ = π/2, the wave polarized
perpendicular to the optical axis is the ordinary one, the wave polarized along the axis is
extraordinary, and propagates with the velocity c/ne.

2.2 The phase-matching angle

No wave interaction can occur far from the phase resonance, or phase-matching. Therefore
we must work close to it. We denote by vϕ(ω) and vϕ(2ω) the phase velocities of the
fundamental and second harmonic respectively. The phase-matching condition obviously is

vϕ(ω) = vϕ(2ω).

(2.4)

Mixed Perturbative Expansion: the Validity of a Model for the Cascading

129

It is well-known [17] that this phase-matching condition can be realized by some adequate
choice of the value of the angle θ between the optical axis (z-axis) and the propagation
direction. Several situations arise, depending on the relative magnitude of the indices in
the considered material and on the polarization of both waves. We consider only one of
these cases, of major importance for applications. For KDP and many other materials,
the inequalities no(2ω) > no(ω) and no(ω) > ne(ω) are satisﬁed. It is easily shown that in
this case the phase-matching angle exists when the fundamental wave is ordinary and the
second-harmonic extraordinary, but does not exist for other polarizations, except if both
waves are extraordinary. In the latter situation, the experimental values of ne and no do not
yield a real phase-matching angle value. We restrict thus the study to the particular case
where the fundamental wave is ordinary and the second-harmonic extraordinary, which
is the only physical situation in which the phase-matching angle exists for the materials
under consideration. The phase-matching condition is then [17]

(2.7)

The ﬁrst condition to be satisﬁed by our ansatz is that the angle θ between the propagation
direction and the z-axis must satisfy the phase-matching condition (2.5), at least in an
approximate way.

2.3 Transverse velocity

The dispersion relation ω(~k) follows from (2.3), the value of the group velocity is then
computed according to ~v = ∂ω/∂~k. While the group velocity of the ordinary wave is par-
allel to the phase velocity, that of the extraordinary wave has a transverse component [17].

(k is the wave vector and ω the pulsation of the fundamental, n′

we expect that the walk-oﬀ is small, ve,x must be close to zero. This can be achieved in
two ways: either by setting ne close to no, or when sin 2θ is small. Try ﬁrst to satisfy
the former condition: anisotropy must be weak. However, anisotropy is needed for the
phase-matching that must be realized at least in an approximate way. The diﬀerence
no) appears indeed in the denominator of (2.5), and therefore it cannot be zero. The
(ne −
no), must be small but not too small. This is the second
anisotropy, or the diﬀerence (ne −
condition imposed to our ansatz. It can be satisﬁed in many real materials.

It is likely also necessary that sin 2θ is small. We note in (2.5) that, when ne(2ω) =
no(ω), then sin2 θ = 1.
In this case θ = π/2 and sin 2θ = 0. We deduce this way
a third condition to be satisﬁed by the ansatz: ne(2ω) must be close to no(ω). Thus the
achievement of phase-matching and reduction of walk-oﬀ necessitate that no(2ω) and ne(ω)
are very close together, and that anisotropy is weak. The ansatz used below is built in
order to satisfy these conditions. It is seen from published experimental data [6] that they

130

H Leblond

are realized in many real materials which are in fact the most commonly used for practical
applications of the second harmonic generation. Further it was very early recognized that
the arising of the transverse group velocity or walk-oﬀ is the main limitation to an eﬃcient
second harmonic generation at phase-matching angle [3], and the fact that the condition
“ne(2ω) close to no(ω)” ensures the reduction of the walk-oﬀ in this situation follows
straightforwardly from the properties of light propagation in a birefringent medium.

3 An adequate ansatz

3.1 The scaling parameter

As usual in the frame of multiscale analysis, we introduce some small parameter ε.
It
characterizes the pulse size in the following way: we call L the common order of magnitude
of the pulse length and width, and λ the wavelength. Then the perturbative parameter is
deﬁned as

The electric ﬁeld ~E is expanded both in a power series of some small parameter ε, and in
a Fourier series of some fundamental phase φ as

~E =

l eipφ.

Xl≥l0,p∈Z

(3.1)

(3.2)

l0 ﬁxes the order of magnitude of the main term. It is discussed below. The amplitudes ~Ep
l
are functions of slow variables that are deﬁned below. The main slow variables characterize
the pulse shape and its propagation at the group velocity. According to (3.1), they are
variables of order ε, deﬁned by

ξ = εx,

η = εy,

ζ = εz,

τ = εt.

(3.3)

We seek for the evolution of the pulse shape through propagation distances long in relation
to the pulse length L, say L/ε, as in the standard nonlinear Schr¨odinger model. On these
grounds and because the propagation direction is close to the x-axis (see below), the slow
variable giving account for the evolution can be chosen as

ξ2 = ε2x.

(3.4)

3.2 The carrier

The phase φ determines the carrier monochromatic plane wave. It thus determines the
propagation direction. Recall that, because phase-matching must be at least approxi-
mately realized, the angle θ between the z-axis and the propagation direction must be
close to the value given in (2.5). On the other hand, it has been shown in subsection 2.3
that the latter value must be close to π/2. We write it as

θ =

2 −

εaγ,

where γ is a free parameter at this point, and the exponent a is positive and is determined
below. The phase φ is

(3.7)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

A dependency with regard to some slow variable εaz appears (a > 0). For a
1, this
dependency can be incorporated in the amplitude, that depends on ζ = εz. Thus only
values of a less than 1 are interesting. On these grounds, and taking into account the fact
that the perturbative expansion will involve only integer powers of εa, it is seen that the
correct choice for a is a = 1/2. Further, due to the anisotropy, the wave vector norm k
depends on the angle θ. Thus, according to (3.5), k depends on ε. As ε tends to 0, k must
be expanded in a power series of √ε. A term involving √εx appears then in (3.7). The
terms of order ε1 and higher are incorporated in the amplitude. The complete phase φ
can thus be written as

≥

φ = k

1 + α√ε

In the same way as k, all quantities such as group velocities or polarization vectors, that
(cid:1)
depend on the angle θ, are expanded in a power series of √ε. Therefore we must introduce

Leaving aside the half integer powers of ε, this is mainly the “classical” multiscale
expansion that leads ordinary to the nonlinear Schr¨odinger-type (NLS-type) models ([7],
p. 495 sq.) describing long-distance propagation along the x-axis. Recall indeed that
it is not necessary to introduce a priori the statement that the ﬁeld is at ﬁrst order a
function of (x
V t). Else, the linear transport equation, that is the equation giving
account for the modulation propagation at group velocity, is obtained as a solvability
condition of the perturbative scheme. The main originality of the expansion (3.2)–(3.9) is
the introduction of an intermediate scale x√ε, z√ε in the expression of the phase φ. The
expansion therefore involves not only 3 scales for the longitudinal space variable, as in
the usual NLS-type expansions, but 5 diﬀerent scales (including ξ1). The term √εkγz in
expression (3.8) for φ represents a deviation for an angle √εγ from the propagation along
the x-axis.

3.3 Expansion of the susceptibility

Here comes the diﬃcult point which is the introduction of a second approximation beside
the multiscale expansion. It has been seen that the components of the linear susceptibility
tensor must satisfy several hypotheses that allow certain approximations to be made. The
problem is that the only consistent way of describing mathematically these hypotheses
requires the χ(1) tensor to be written as a function of the perturbative parameter ε.
However, ε represents the pulse size, and χ(1) does not depend on it from the physical

132

point of view. Nevertheless, we assume that the linear susceptibility tensor χ(1) can be
formally expanded in a power series of √ε in the following way:

3.4 The amplitude

An important diﬀerence between the ansatz (3.2) and the standard one for NLS is the
order of magnitude of the leading term, that is the value of l0 in (3.2). It is determined
as follows. The model that we intend to derive and to justify is used in [16, 14, 9]. It has
the following form:

i∂ξ2 ϕ + D2
~ξ
i∂ξ2ψ + D′2

ϕ = A1 ψϕ∗,
~ξ ψ = A2 ϕ2,

(3.11a)

and D′2
where D2
~ξ are second-order partial diﬀerential operators relative to the slow variab-
~ξ
les (τ
ξ/V ), η, ζ that describe the shape of the pulse. A1, A2 are some constants.
ϕ and ψ are the amplitudes of the fundamental and second harmonic respectively. These
amplitudes are assumed to have an order of magnitude εl0. Furthermore, ξ, η, ζ, τ have an
order of magnitude ε, and ξ2 an order ε2. Therefore the left-hand-side of equation (3.11)
has the order ε2+l0, and its right-hand-side has the order ε2l0 . We must thus have 2 + l0 =
2l0, and l0 = 2.

This diﬀers from the case of the cubic NLS equation, which is

i∂ξ2f + D2
~ξ

f + Af

f
|

2 = 0,
|

(3.12)

with analogous notations, f being the modulated amplitude. There we would have l0 +2 =
3l0, thus l0 = 1. This has a very important physical meaning: the present model requires
input energy pulses from a smaller range than the NLS solitons obtained either in cubic
media by the Kerr eﬀect or in quadratic media by cascading, far from phase-matching [8].
This is due to the fact that the interaction is resonant, or very close to resonance. Note
that the multiscale analysis justiﬁes this diﬀerence between the required power inputs
without making any special assumption about the values of the nonlinear susceptibilities.

4 Solving the perturbative scheme

4.1 A technical point

The order by order resolution of the perturbative scheme can now be performed. The
detail of this derivation is given in the appendix. The vector amplitudes whose evolution

It describes both a propagation at speed v and a linear phase modulation measured by
the coeﬃcient δ1.

(cid:19)

The expressions of the constants v and δ1 are given by solving the multiscale expansion.
They can be interpreted, and written in a convenient way, by using some power series
expansion of the wave numbers. We introduce the following notations:

For the derivatives of these quantities, the notations used are

and

Then the values of the coeﬃcients are found,

δ1 = k1,o −

and

0,o.

Thus the phase factor eiδ1ξ accounts for the corrections to the x-component of the wave
vector ~k at order ε, in norm (term k1,o) and in direction (2nd term). Similar corrections
appear at following order ε3+
2 , it is the factor eiρ1ξ1 in formula (A.9), and for the second
harmonic: the factors eiρ1ξ1 and eiρ2ξ1 in formulas (4.13a) and (4.13b). These corrections
are a characteristic feature of the kind of “mixed” expansion used here.

1

Note that it is decisive, for going further in the perturbative expansion, that equa-
tion (4.2) has its particular form. The multiscale expansion frame considered describes
indeed the long-distance evolution of some state, that is a steady state in the ﬁrst ap-
proximation. Usually, the order zero is a plane wave, invariant in amplitude, thus order
one can be considered. The order one presents Galilean invariance, thus order two can
be considered. Higher order make sense mainly if order two describes a soliton, which

134

H Leblond

is another kind of invariance. Therefore, the arising of a ξ1-dependency should a priori
forbid to go to the next order, except if this dependency presents some invariance. As an
example, an exponentially decreasing ξ1-dependency, describing absorption, would reduce
all following orders to small linear corrections to this decreasing, that would give account
for the main physical behavior. There is, however, some invariance here, because the
ξ1-dependent factors are unitary phase factors, and we can pursue the expansion.

4.2 The phase-matching condition

The ﬁrst order of the dispersion relation, found at ﬁrst nonzero order ε2, is

Because k is unique, the ﬁrst order of the phase-matching condition is obtained as

k =

n(ω)ω
c

n(2ω)ω

.

n(2ω) = n(ω).

(4.9)

(4.10)

The common value of n(ω) and n(2ω) is written n below.

At order ε2+

1
2 , the anisotropy appears through a condition involving αk, the term of
order √ε in the expansion of k. We choose, as written above, the fundamental and the
second harmonic as ordinary and extraordinary waves respectively. α takes the value

2n2 =
Because α is unique, the second order of the phase-matching condition is got at this point.
It is

α =

∆n2

o(ω) = ∆n2

e(2ω).

(4.12)

Thus the two ﬁrst orders of the phase-matching condition are a direct consequence of the
ansatz, precisely of the unicity of the wave vector in the phase φ deﬁned by (3.8). A more
complicated ansatz involving two fundamental phases could be envisaged. However, it
would not be able to give account for the wave interaction. It is indeed proved below that
the following terms in the expansion of the linear susceptibility ˆχ(1) must also coincide
(see equation (4.16)). The same kind of considerations would prove the same result for
ﬁrst order, if it was not set a priori in the ansatz.

The following order of the phase-matching condition appears at order ε4 when wri-
ting down the nonlinear evolution equation for the complex amplitudes ϕ and ψ of the
fundamental and second harmonic respectively. They are equations (3.11), while the
amplitudes ϕ and ψ satisfy

In this frame, there is no dependency of the amplitudes relative to the variables ξ and ξ1.
On the other hand, phase factors depending on these variables appear. These factors are

exp i [(δ2 −

in the evolution equation for ϕ, and the inverse in the evolution equation for ψ. These
two equations yield equations (4.21a) and (4.21b) respectively, after cancellation of the
factors mentioned. This yields two approximate phase-matching conditions, in addition
to (4.11): δ2 = 2δ1 and ρ2 = 2ρ1. The ﬁrst condition can be written as k1,e = 2k1,o, or as

Conditions (4.10), (4.12) and (4.16) do not involve a phase-matching angle. They state
that the approximate phase-matching must be realized “spontaneously” by the material up
to order ε. The last of the phase-matching conditions obtained in the previous subsection is

Formula (4.18) coincides with the usual phase-matching condition (2.5), taking into ac-
count the power series expansion of χ(2) and the “spontaneous” approximate phase-
matching, up to order ε. A deviation from the exact phase-matching of order ε2 is possible.
It is described by the terms B1ϕ in equation (4.21a) and B2ψ in equation (4.21b). The
present multiscale expansion proves that the model is by no means valid for a larger de-
viation. In such a case, only a model involving non-resonant interaction can describe the
physical phenomenon. Completely integrable models such as the nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation (NLS) or the Davey Stewartson system (DS I and II) can be derived in this frame,
but involve much higher intensities: of order ε instead of ε2 in the present case [11, 12].

4.4 The group velocity matching

The phase-matching is a phase velocity matching, but for short pulses a group veloci-
ty matching is also necessary. Without it, the two pulses cross each other without ha-
ving time enough to interact. Mathematically, the group velocity matching condition
appears through the requirement that the variables (˜τ , ˜η, ˜ζ, ˜ξ2) are uniquely deﬁned by
equation (4.14). In other words, the frame moving with the pulses, in which equation (3.11)
describes the evolution of the waves, must be deﬁned in a unique way, thus must be the
same for both waves.

At order ε3, the ﬁrst order term of the group velocity is found. It is 1/v = k′

0,o for the
fundamental and 1/v = k′
0,e for the second harmonic. According to the above statements,
the velocity v is the same for both waves.
If these velocities diﬀer, it is found at next
order that no interaction between the waves is possible. From the formal point of view,

136

H Leblond

the ξ1 and ξ2-dependencies of ϕ and ψ would be linear if both group velocities have not
the same value. For this reason, we must have k′
0,o: this means that the group
velocities coincide at order zero. Using the zero order phase-matching condition (4.10),
this condition can be written in terms of the index n as

0,e = k′

n′(ω) = 2n′(2ω).

(4.19)

The ﬁrst correction 1/v1 to the inverse of the group velocity is obtained at following
for the fundamental and

An explicit walk-oﬀ appears in the ﬁnal equations (4.21a)–(4.21b) through the terms in-
volving a ﬁrst order τ -derivative. It is measured by the diﬀerence between k′
1,e. As
the deviation from phase-matching, the walk-oﬀ has a ﬁxed maximal order of magnitude,
that of ε. If this group velocity matching is not satisﬁed, the model yielded by equations
(4.21a)–(4.21b) is theoretically no more valid. This means physically that for a pulse size,
a power input, and a propagation distance in accordance with the scaling, the two waves
do not coexist at the same place during a long enough time, and cannot interact.

The nonlinear interaction constant A1 and A2 are deﬁned in the general case by equations
(A.24)–(A.30) (in appendix). Using the symmetry properties of the χ(2)-tensor, inclu-
ding the so-called complete symmetry property, we have A2 = 2A1, at least for the ¯42m
and 3m symmetry classes, for which the common value of these coeﬃcients is given by
equations (A.27) and (A.29).

Equations (4.21a) and (4.21b) yield the sought model. They are analogous to the
equations given by Menyuk in [14], but here in a complete (3 + 1)-dimensional version.
Kanashov and Rubenchik shown [9] that no collapse occurs in this model, and that a soliton
solution exists in the sense of a stable localized pulse. System (4.21a)–(4.21b) is written
in a coordinate frame that moves with the wave at a speed equal to its group velocity up
to order √ε. It is seen that the group velocity of both fundamental and second harmonic
must coincide up to this order. Walk-oﬀ terms of order ε appear in equations (4.21a)
and (4.21b). These are the terms involving ﬁrst order τ - and ζ-derivatives. In an analogous
way, it is seen that the approximate phase-matching must be realized “spontaneously” by
the material up to order ε, and once more at order ε3/2 by some particular choice of the
angle √εγ, according to equation (4.18).

Consider now the expansion (3.10) of the susceptibility tensor, that also has the ex-
pression (2.3). Because we must have an isotropic zero order term, √ε is the order of
magnitude of the anisotropy. The interaction must be phase-matched “spontaneously” up

5 Conclusion

A long-distance propagation model (equations (4.21a)–(4.21b)) for two interacting waves
with diﬀerent velocities has been derived through a rigorous multiscale analysis. It uses
a new type of expansion that mixes a multiscale expansion, and an expansion in a power
series of some physical quantity, that here represents mainly the anisotropy. This expan-
sion involves 5 longitudinal space scales, instead of 3 in the usual NLS-type models. The

138

H Leblond

supplementary scale is related to approximate conditions satisﬁed by the linear suscep-
tibilities. The expansion considered will be useful for the mathematical justiﬁcation of
asymptotic models of the above mentioned type. This rigorous derivation has allowed the
determination of the validity conditions of the model.

From a more concrete point of view, the model equations (4.21a-4.21b) describe the
evolution of the modulation of two short localized pulses, fundamental and second har-
monic, propagating together in a bulk uniaxial crystal with non-vanishing second order
susceptibility χ(2), and interacting. Much theoretical work has already been done about
this system. It has been proved that no collapse occurs [9, 1], analytical solutions have
been found in (1 + 1) dimensions [14], and numerical simulations have shown the existence
of stable solutions [16]. We have determined the physical conditions under which the
model is valid: both phase and group velocity of the waves must be close enough together.
Group velocities are matched when anisotropy is small. Thus the phase-matching angle
must be small. Therefore, the phase-matching must be realized by the intrinsic properties
of the material and for any propagation direction with some precision. Hence the model
cannot be valid in any material and at any frequency. X-Mozilla-Status: 0000

Appendix. Details of the derivation

A.1 Dispersion relation

In this appendix, we give the rigorous derivation of system (4.21a)–(4.21b), using the
perturbative scheme described in Section 2. The convolutions involved by expression (2.2)
of ~D are treated using the formulas derived in [11]. We solve it order by order: the ﬁrst
nonzero order, ε2, gives that Ep,s
is zero for all s = x, y, z, and all integer p, except for
2
p =

2, and s = y, z, if the dispersion relation (4.9) is satisﬁed.

pression (4.11) of the coeﬃcient α. The polarization vectors ~E1

are deﬁned as (4.1). ϕ and ψ are the amplitudes whose evolution is under investigation,

Thus, relative to ˆξ, ∂ ˆξf is some constant A, and

B being some constant. Because f0 must be bounded as ˆξ tends to inﬁnity, A must be
zero. This implies that f0 is a function of ˆτ alone, and this yields some partial diﬀerential

A.4 The evolution equations

At order ε4, the evolution equations for ϕ and ψ are obtained as follows: the equation of
order ε4 for the y-component of the fundamental is a partial diﬀerential equation involving
F , f , and ϕ. Using the variables ˆξ and ˆτ deﬁned by equation (A.5), and writing F =
F0(ˆξ, ˆτ )eiδ1 ˆξ, it is found that ∂ ˆξF0 is equal to some expression depending on ϕ0, f0, and
their derivatives. This expression does not depend on ˆξ. Thus, as shown above for f0, F0
is a function of ˆτ only, and the terms depending on F cancel in the equation.

(A.20)

The notation ∂ ˆξ1 holds for the partial derivative relative to ξ1 in the variables deﬁned by
equation (A.20). Transferring (A.9) and (A.20) into the equation, the following result is
obtained: ∂ ˆξ1f1 is equal to some expression that depends on ϕ1 only. Thus ∂ ˆξ1f1 does not
depend on ξ1. Because f1 must be bounded as ξ1 tends to inﬁnity, f1 is independent of ξ1
too. Then f1 disappears from the equation, that reduces to the evolution equation (4.21a)
for ϕ, taking into account the nonlinear term computed in the following subsection.

The equation for the second harmonic is obtained in a similar way.

It comes from
the equation of the multiscale expansion at order ε4, for the z-component of the second
harmonic. In the same way as for the functions F and f in the case of the fundamental,
it is seen that the functions G and g must have the form

G = G0

The value of this nonlinear term depends on the symmetry properties of the χ(2)-tensor.
For the ¯42m class of crystals, to which belongs e.g. KDP, in the crystal axes frame [4], the
non-vanishing components of the χ(2)-tensor are

would be zero. Thus the crystal axes must be rotated for some angle β around the optical
axis (the z-axis). We call (x′, y′, z′) this rotated crystal axes frame. Relative to it, the
nonlinear term becomes

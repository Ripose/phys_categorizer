Abstract

Counter-propagating light ﬁelds have the ability to create self-organized one-dimensional opti-

cally bound arrays of microscopic particles, where the light ﬁelds adapt to the particle locations

and vice versa. We develop a theoretical model to describe this situation and show good agreement

with recent experimental data (Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 128301 (2002)) for two and three particles, if

the scattering force is assumed to dominate the axial trapping of the particles. The extension of

these ideas to two and three dimensional optically bound states is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The ability of light to inﬂuence the kinetic motion of microscopic and atomic matter has

had a profound impact in the last three decades. The optical manipulation of matter was

ﬁrst seriously studied by Ashkin and co-workers in the 1970s [1, 2, 3], and led ultimately to

the demonstration of the single beam gradient force trap [4], referred to as optical tweezers,

where the gradient of an optical ﬁeld can induce dielectric particles of higher refractive index

than their surrounding medium to be trapped in three dimensions in the light ﬁeld maxima

[4]. Much of Ashkin’s early work centered not on gradient forces, but on the use of radiation

pressure to trap particles [1], and a dual beam radiation pressure trap was demonstrated in

a which single particle was conﬁned. This work ultimately contributed to the development

of the magneto-optical trap for neutral atoms [5].

Recently we observed one-dimensional arrays of silica spheres trapped in a dual beam

radiation pressure trap [6]. These arrays had an unusual property in that the particles that

formed the array were regularly spaced from each other. The particles were redistributing

the incident light ﬁeld, which in turn redistributed the particle spacings, allowing them to

reside in equilibrium positions. This eﬀect, known as “optically bound matter” was ﬁrst

realised in a slightly diﬀerent context via a diﬀerent mechanism to ours some years ago [7, 8]

using a single laser beam and was explained as the interaction of the coherently induced

dipole moments of microscopic spheres in an optical ﬁeld creating bound matter.

In the context of our study optically bound matter is of interest as it relates to the way

in which particles interact with the light ﬁeld in extended optical lattices, which may prove

useful for the understanding of three-dimensional trapping of colloidal particles [9]. Indeed

optically bound matter may provide an attractive method for the creation of such lattices

that are not possible using interference patterns. Bound matter may also serve as a test bed

for studies of atomic or ionic analogues to our microscopic system [10].

Subsequent to our report a similar observation was made in an experiment making use

of a dual beam ﬁber trap [11]. In this latter paper a theory was developed that examined

particles of approximately the same size as the laser wavelength involved. In this paper we

develop a numerical model that allows us to simulate the equilibrium positions of two and

three particles in a counter-propagating beam geometry, where the particle sizes are larger

than the laser wavelength, and fall outside the upper bound of the limits discussed in [11].

2

The model can readily be extended to look at larger arrays of systems. We discuss the role

of the scattering and refraction of light in the creation of arrays. In the next section we

describe the numerical model we use for our studies and derive predictions for the separation

of two and three spheres of various sizes. We then compare this with both previous and

current experiments.

II. THEORY SECTION

Our model comprises two monochromatic laser ﬁelds of frequency ω counter-propagating

along the z-axis which interact with a system of N transparent dielectric spheres of mass

m, refractive-index ns, and radius R, with centers at positions {~rj(t)}, j = 1, 2, . . . N, and

which are immersed in a host medium of refractive-index nh. The electric ﬁeld is written

~E(~r, t) =

ˆe

(1)

where ˆe is the unit polarization vector of the ﬁeld, E±(~r) are the slowly varying electric

ﬁeld amplitudes of the right or forward propagating (+) and left or backward propagating

(−) ﬁelds, and k = nhω/c is the wavevector of the ﬁeld in the host medium. The incident

ﬁelds are assumed to be collimated Gaussians at longitudinal coordinates z = −L/2 for the

forward ﬁeld and z = L/2 for the backward ﬁeld

E+(x, y, z = −L/2) = E−(x, y, z = L/2) =

where r2 = x2 + y2, w0 is the initial Gaussian spot size, and P0 is the input power in each

beam. It is assumed that all the spheres are contained between the beam waists within the

length L >> R.

Consider ﬁrst that the dielectric spheres are in a ﬁxed conﬁguration at time t speciﬁed by

the centers {~rj(t)}. Then the dielectric spheres provide a spatially inhomogeneous refractive

index distribution which can be written in the form

n2(~r) = n2

h + (n2

θ(R − |~r − ~rj(t)|),

(3)

where θ(R − |~r − ~rj(t)|) is the Heaviside step function which is unity within the sphere of

radius R centered on ~r = ~rj(t), and zero outside, and ns is the refractive-index of the spheres.

Then, following standard approaches [12], the counter-propagating ﬁelds evolve according

to the paraxial wave equations

is the transverse Laplacian describing beam diﬀraction. Thus, a given conﬁguration of the

dielectric spheres modiﬁes the ﬁelds E±(~r) in a way that can be calculated from the above

ﬁeld equations. We remark that even though the spheres move, and hence so does the

refractive-index distribution, the ﬁelds will always adiabatically slave to the instantaneous

sphere conﬁguration.

To proceed we need equations of motion for how the sphere centers {~rj(t)} move in

reaction to the ﬁelds. The time-averaged dipole interaction energy [4], relative to that for

a homogeneous dielectric medium of refractive-index nh, between the counter-propagating

ﬁelds and the system of spheres is given by

where the angled brackets signify a time-average which kills fast-varying components at 2ω.

The most important concept is that the dipole interaction potential depends on the spatial

conﬁguration of the spheres U(~r1, . . . , ~rN ) since the counter-propagating ﬁelds themselves

depends on the sphere distribution via the paraxial wave equations (4). This form of the

dipole interaction potential (5) shows explicitly that we pick up a contribution from each

sphere labelled j via its interaction with the local intensity. Assuming over-damped motion

of the spheres in the host medium with viscous damping coeﬃcient γ, the equation of motion

for the sphere centers become

mγ

d~rj

= ~Fgrad,j + ~Fscatt,j,

~Fgrad,j = −∇jU(~r1, . . . , ~rN )

(6)

where ∇j signiﬁes a gradient with respect to ~rj, and ~Fgrad,j, ~Fscatt,j are the gradient and the
scattering forces experienced by the jth sphere, the latter of which we shall give an expression

for below.

Carrying through simulations for a 3D system with modelling of the electromagnetic

propagation in the presence of many spheres poses a formidable challenge, so here we take

4

advantage of the symmetry of the system to reduce the calculation involved. First, for the

cylindrically symmetric Gaussian input beams used here we assume that the combination

of the dipole interaction potential, and associated gradient force, and the scattering force

supplies a strong enough transverse conﬁning potential that the sphere motion remains

directed along the z-axis. This means that the positions of the sphere centers are located

along the z-axis ~rj(t) = ˆzzj(t), and that the gradient and scattering forces are also directed
along the z-axis ~Fj = ˆzFj. Second, we assume that the sphere distribution along the z-axis

is symmetric around z = 0, the beam foci being at z = ±L/2. This means, for example,

that for one sphere the center is located at z = 0, for two spheres the centers are located at

z = ±D/2, D being the sphere separation distance, and for three spheres the centers are at

z = 0, ±D. For three or less spheres the symmetric conﬁguration of spheres is captured by

the sphere spacing D, and we shall consider this case here. For more than three spheres the

situation becomes more complicated and we conﬁne our discussion to the simplest cases of

two and three spheres.

With the above approximations in mind the equations of motion for the sphere centers

At this point it is advantageous to consider the case of two spheres, N = 2, to illustrate how

calculations are performed. For a given distance D between the spheres we calculate the

counter-propagating ﬁelds between z = [0, L] using the beam propagation method. From

the ﬁelds we can numerically calculate the dipole interaction energy U(D) for a given sphere

separation, and the resulting axial (z-directed) gradient force is then Fgrad(D) = −∂U/∂D.

Thus, by calculating the counter-propagating ﬁelds for a variety of sphere separations we

can numerically calculate the gradient force which acts on the relative coordinate of the two

spheres. For our system we approximate the scattering force [13] along the positive z-axis

for the jth sphere as

with σ the scattering cross-section. This formula is motivated by the generic relation Fscatt =

nhPscatt/c for unidirectional propagation, with the scattered power Pscatt = σI0, and I0 the

incident intensity. The integral yields the diﬀerence in power between the two counter-

propagating beams integrated over the sphere cross-section, and when this is divided by the

5

sphere cross-sectional area πR2 we get the averaged intensity diﬀerence over the spheres. For

the case of two spheres we calculate the scattering force Fscatt(D), evaluated at the position

of the sphere at z = D/2, and for a variety of sphere spacings D. A similar procedure can

readily be applied to the case of three spheres.

Our goal is to compare the axial gradient and scattering forces for an array of two and

three spheres and compare with the experimental results. However, the scattering cross-

section for our spheres, which incorporates all sources of scattering in a phenomenological

manner, cannot be calculated with any certainty. Our approach, therefore, will be to cal-

culate the equilibrium sphere separation F (D) = 0 for the gradient and scattering forces

separately, which does not depend on the value of the cross-section, and compare the cal-

culated sphere separations with the experimental values. By comparing the theoretical

predictions with the experiment for N = 2, 3 we can diagnose the dominant source of the

axial force acting on the spheres.

III. EXPERIMENT

To compare our theory with experiment we use data from our previous work [6] and also

recreate that experiment, but using a diﬀerent laser wavelength and particle sphere size.

The previously reported experiment [6] makes use of a continuous-wave 780nm Ti:Sapphire

laser, which is split into two beams with approximately equal power (25mW) in each arms.

Each of the beams is focussed down to a spot with a 3.5 µm beam waist and then passed,

counterpropagating, through a cuvette with dimensions of 5mm x 5mm x 20mm. The beam

waists were separated by a ﬁnite amount, which is discussed further below. Uniform silica

spheres with a 3µm diameter (Bangs Laboratories, Inc) in a water solution were placed

in the cuvette, and the interaction of the beam with the sample caused one-dimensional

arrays of particle to be formed. We also carried out a similar experiment using a 1064nm

Nd:YAG laser where the beam waists were 4.3µm and we used 2.3µm diameter spheres.

The particles were viewed by looking at the scattered light orthogonal to the laser beam

propagation direction viewed on a CCD camera with an attached microscope objective (x20,

NA=0.4, Newport).

To compare our theory with experimental results we need to concentrate on a small

number of parameters, the sphere size, the beam waist, the refractive index of the spheres

6

and the beam waist separation. We know the particle sizes and can make a good estimate as

to their refractive index, further we can measure the beam waist to a high degree of accuracy.

The only problematic factor is the beam waist separation. Due to experimental constraints,

this is quite diﬃcult to measure. We estimate the waist separation by ﬁlling the cuvette

with a high density particle solution and looking at the scattered light from the sample. The

high density of particle allows us to map out the intensity pattern of the two beams and

hence make an estimate as to the waist separation. This is, however, an inaccurate method

and leaves us with an error of more than 100%. We therefore use our model to help us ﬁx

the beam waist separation on a single result and then examine the behavior of the model

when varying other parameters.

We begin by examining the case of the 2.3 micron diameter spheres.

A. 2.3 micron diameter spheres

We consider the case for chains of both 2 and 3 spheres. Here we measure a sphere

separation of 34µm, for a beam waist, ω0 = 4.3µm at a laser wavelength, λ = 1064nm.

Using a beam waist separation of 180µm our model predicts a equilibrium in the scattering

force of 34µm, as is shown in ﬁgure 1. We see no such equilibrium in the gradient force, shown

in ﬁgure 2 and conclude that the scattering force is the dominant factor in this instance.

Using the same parameters for the three sphere case give us a sphere separation prediction of

62µm, as shown in ﬁgure 3. Again this dominates over the gradient force, this assumption

being valid, as the theory gives a good prediction of our experimental observations. Our

experimental result is 57µm, but we estimate our model value falls within the standard

deviation error we observe on our experimental measurements.

B. 3 micron diameter spheres

The data for 3 microns spheres carried out at a diﬀerent wavelength than the 2.3 micron

data (λ = 780nm) also ﬁts well with our theory. For two spheres, with the beam waists

150µm apart, we predict a sphere separation of 47µm (ﬁgure 4) while our experiment

predicts a distance of 45µm. Using the same parameters for the three sphere case we

predict a sphere separation of 27µm (ﬁgure 5), while our experiment predicts 35µm. Again,

as we predict equilibrium positions with the scattering force component, but not with the

gradient force component, we conclude that the scattering force is the dominant factor in

determining the ﬁnal sphere separations.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Our model accurately predicts separations for the case of two and three spheres, at certain

approximation, the assumption is that in these smaller size regimes the model breaks down.

This in contrast to the work detailed in [11] which works in size regimes closer to the laser

wavelength, λ, and begins to break down in the larger size regimes (λ > 2D), where D is

the sphere diameter.

We also note that the beam separation distance becomes less critical as it become larger.

For small beam waist separation distances, any change in this parameter leads to a sharp

change in the sphere separation distance, whereas at the distances we work at the change

is separation distance is far more gentle, and hence can give some rise to uncertainty over

exact ﬁts with theory and experiment. The other main parameter is sphere size, which has

an appreciable aﬀect on the predicted sphere separation. The incident power on the spheres

does not make much of a diﬀerence and is more of a scaling factor in the forces involved

rather than a direct modiﬁer in the model. Sensitivity is also evident when changing the

refractive index diﬀerence between the spheres and the surrounding medium.

It should also be possible to create two-dimensional and possibly three dimensional ar-

rays from optically bound matter. The extension to two dimensions is relatively simple to

envisage with the use of multiple pairs of counterpropagating laser beams. In three dimen-

sions the formation of such optically bound arrays may circumvent some of the problems

associated with loading of three-dimensional optical lattices [9]. It is often assumed that

the creation of an optical lattice (via multibeam interference, say) will allow the simple,

unambiguous trapping of particles in all the lattice sites, thereby making an extended three-

dimensional array of particles. Such arrays may be useful for crystal template formation [9]

and in studies of crystallization processes [14, 15]. However crystal formation in this manner

is not particularly robust in that as the array is ﬁlled the particles perturb the propagating

light ﬁeld such that they prevent the trap sites below them being eﬃciently ﬁlled. Arrays of

optically bound matter do not suﬀer from such problems, as they are organized as a result

10

of the perturbation of the propagating ﬁelds. Further the fact that the particles are bound

together provides more realistic opportunities for studying crystal and colloidal behaviour

than that in unbound optically generated arrays, such as those produced holographically

[14, 16, 17].

We have developed a model by which the propagation of counter-propagating lasers beams

moving past an array of silica spheres may be examined. Analysis of the resulting forces on

the spheres allows us to predict the separation of the spheres which constitute the array. We

have compared this model with experimental results for diﬀerent beam parameters (wave-

length, waist separation, waist diameter) and found the results to be in good agreement

with our observations. The model, does not however, work with sphere sizes much less than

approximately twice the laser wavelength. Our model is readily extendable to larger number

of spheres, and will be of great use in the study of such one- and higher-dimensional arrays

of optically bound matter.

In this paper, we present an approximate expression for determining the eﬀective permittivity
describing the coherent propagation of an electromagnetic wave in random media. Under the Qua-
sicrystalline Coherent Potential Approximation (QC-CPA), it is known that multiple scattering
theory provided an expression for this eﬀective permittivity. The numerical evaluation of this one
is, however, a challenging problem. To ﬁnd a tractable expression, we add some new approximations
to the (QC-CPA) approach. As a result, we obtained an expression for the eﬀective permittivity
which contained at the same time the Maxwell-Garnett formula in the low frequency limit, and the
Keller formula, which has been recently proved to be in good agreement for particles exceeding the
wavelength.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The description of electromagnetic waves propagation
in random media in term of the properties of the con-
stituents has been studied extensively in the past decades
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
In most of works, the ba-
sic idea is to calculate several statistical moments of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld to understand how the wave inter-
act with the the random medium [8, 11, 12, 13, 16].
In this paper, we are concerned by the ﬁrst moment
which is the average electric ﬁeld. Under some assump-
it can be shown that the average electric ﬁeld
tion,
propagates as if the medium where homogeneous but
with a renormalized permittivity, termed eﬀective per-
mittivity. The calculation of this parameter as a long
history which dates back from the work of Clausius-
Mossotti and Maxwell Garnett [24]. Since then, most
of the study are concerned with the quasi-static limit
where retardation eﬀect are neglected [21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. In order to take
into account scattering eﬀects, quantum multiple scat-
tering theory has been transposed in the electromagnetic
case [6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16], but as a rigorous analytical an-
swer is unreachable, several approximation schemes have
been developed [6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. One of the most advanced
is the Quasicrystalline Coherent Potential Approxima-
tion (QC-CPA) which takes into account the correlation
between the particles [13, 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Un-
fortunately, except at low frequency, the answer is still
too involved to permit the calculation of the eﬀective
permittivity.

The aim of this paper is to add some new approx-

imations to the (QC-CPA) approach which furnish a
tractable equation for the eﬀective permittivity. The ex-
pression obtained contains the low frequency limit of the
(QC-CPA) approach. At this limit, the (QC-CPA) equa-
tions can be written as a generalized Maxwell Garnett
formula and are proven to be in good agreement with the
experimental results [15, 16, 49, 50, 51]. Furthermore,
the formula obtained contains also the approximate for-
mula due to Keller, which has been derived in using scalar
theory, but seems to be in accord with the experimental
data for particles larger than a wavelength [52, 53, 54].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
introduce the multiple scattering formalism and we show
under what hypothesis the eﬀective medium theory is
valid. In section III, we recall the diﬀerent steps in order
to obtain the system of equation veriﬁed by the eﬀec-
tive permittivity under the (QC-CPA) approach. Then,
we introduce, in section IV, some new approximations in
order to obtain a tractable formula for the eﬀective per-
mittivity. In the two following section V, VI, we derive
respectively the low frequency and high frequency limit
of our new approach.

II. DYSON EQUATION AND EFFECTIVE
PERMITTIVITY

In the following, we consider harmonic waves with
e−iωt pulsation. We consider an ensemble of N ≫ 1 iden-
tical spheres of radius rs with dielectric function ǫs(ω)
within a inﬁnite medium with dielectric function ǫ1(ω).
The ﬁeld produced at r by a discrete source located at r0
is given by the dyadic Green function G(r, r0, ω), which
veriﬁes the following propagation equation:

∇ × ∇ × G(r, r0, ω) − ǫV (r, ω) K 2

vac G(r, r0, ω)
= δ(r − r0)I

(1)

where Kvac = ω/c with c the speed of light in vaccum
and

If we introduce the T matrix of each scatterer by:

tri = vri + vri · G

ǫV (r, ω) = ǫ1(ω) +

[ǫs(ω) − ǫ1(ω)] Θs(r − rj) ,

where r1, . . . , rN are the center of the particles and Θs
describes the spherical particle shape :

we can decompose the T matrix for the whole system, in a
series of multiple scattering processes by the particles [6,
11, 13, 16]:

The solution of equation (1) is uniquely deﬁned if we
impose the radiation condition at inﬁnity.

The multiple scattering process by the particles is
mathematically decomposed in introducing the Green
∞
function G
1 , describing the propagation within an ho-
mogenous medium with permittivity ǫ1(ω), which veriﬁes
the following equation:

∇ × ∇ × G

vac G

∞

= δ(r − r0)I ,

with the appropriate boundary conditions. In an inﬁnite
random medium, we have [16, 55, 56]:

In using this Green function, we decompose the Green
function G(r, r0, ω) under the following form [6, 11, 13,
16]:

This T matrix is useful to calculate the average ﬁeld <

age Green function < G > is the mass operator Σ deﬁned
by:

< G >= G

(16)

Similarly to equation (11), we have the following rela-
tionship between the average T matrix and the mass op-
erator:

The mass operator correspond to all irreducible diagrams
in the Feynman representation [6, 8, 11, 13]. The equa-
tion (16) written in diﬀerential form is:

[A · B](r, r0) =

d3 r1 A(r, r1) · B(r1, r0) .

The potential V , which describes the interaction between
the wave and the particles, is given by:

Z

vri (r, r0, ω) = (2π)2 δ(r − r0) vri(r, ω) ,
s − K 2
1 ] Θd(r − ri)I .

vri(r, ω) = [K 2

For a statistical homogeneous medium we have:

Σ(r, r1, ω) = Σ(r − r1, ω) ,
< G(r, r0, ω) > =< G(r − r0, ω) > .

Thus, we can use a Fourier transform:

For a statistical isotropic medium, we have:

e(−||k||, ω) . In using the residue the-
orem, we easily evaluate these integrals. However, we
neglect the longitudinal excitation, which are solutions
of ǫ⊥
e(K, ω) = 0, since we are only
interested by the propagation of the transversal ﬁeld.

e (K, ω) = 0 and ǫk

Furthermore, we see that the contribution due to pole
K = 0 in the second term of equation (32) is null; in
fact, the dyadic ∇∇ operate on a constant since we have
ei K ||r|| = 1 for this pole. Hence, we obtain the following
expression for the Green function:

where Ke i are the roots of K 2
vac such
as Im(Ke i) > 0 to insure that the radiation condition
at inﬁnity is veriﬁed. Sheng has called the roots Ke i
the quasi-modes of the random media [11, 43].
If we
only consider the root Ke = Ke j which has the smallest
imaginary part (Im(Ke j) = mini [Im(Ke i)]) and then
the smallest exponential factor in equation (33), we de-
ﬁne the eﬀective permittivity by ǫe(ω) = ǫ⊥
e (Ke, ω). The
average Green function is then equal to the Green func-
tion for an inﬁnite homogenous medium with permittiv-
ity ǫe(ω) :

Thus, the eﬀective medium approach is valid if we ne-
glect the longitudinal excitation in the medium and if
the propagative mode with the smallest imaginary part
is the primary contribution in the developpement (33).

III. THE COHERENT-POTENTIAL AND
QUASI-CRYSTALLINE APPROXIMATIONS

Previously, we have shown how the mass operator is re-
lated to the eﬀective permittivity. To calculate the mass
operator, we can use equations (14) and (18). However,
we can improve this system of equations in rewriting the
Green function development (5) in replacing the Green
function G

∞
1 by G

∞
e :

G = G

∞
e + G

∞
e · V e · G ,

where we have to introduce a new potential V e:

V e =

Similarly to the previous section, we introduce a T matrix
such that:

(42)

In supposing that the eﬀective medium approach is cor-
rect, we impose the following condition on the average
ﬁeld:

e

e

e

e

< G(r, ω) >= Ge(r, ω) ,

or equivalently,

< T e >= 0 ,

(43)

(44)

due to equation (40). The condition (43) is the Coherent-
Potential Approximation (CPA) [12, 13, 16, 35, 40]. The
expression (44) and (41) form a closed system of equa-
tions on the unknown permittivity ǫe(ω). To the ﬁrst or-
der in density of particles, this system of equations gives
equation:

<

te,ri >= 0 .

(45)

In Fourier-space, the T matrix for one scatterer veriﬁes
the property:

te,ri (k|k0) = e−i(k−k0)·ri

te,o(k|k0) ,

(46)

e

te,o is the T matrix for a particle located at the ori-
where
gin of coordinate. The average of the exponential term,
introduced in equation (45) by the properties (46), gives
for a statistical homogeneous medium:

and

where we have introduced the density of scatterers n =
N/V with V the volume of the random medium. The
condition (45) becomes:

te,o(k0|k0) = 0 .

(49)

e

This CPA condition has been used in several works [11,
te,ri (k|k0)
43, 57]. It is worth mentioning that operator
is not the T matrix describing the scattering by a particle
of permittivity ǫs(ω) surrounded by a medium of permit-
tivity ǫe(ω). To do so, the operator (39) should have the
following form:

e

ve,ri (r, ω) = [K 2

s (ω) − K 2

e (ω)] Θs(r − ri)I .

(50)

e

4

1 − K 2

ve,ri (r, ω) is quiet
However, we see that the operator
diﬀerent from the equation (39), and in particular we
ve;ri (r, ω) = [K 2
e ]I for ||r − ri|| > rs contrary
have
ve;ri (r, ω) = 0 when r is
to the deﬁnition (50), where
te,ri is non-local
outside the particle. Thus, the operator
and cannot be obtained from the classical Mie theory [2,
te,ri is
4, 35]. To overcome this diﬃculty, the operator
replaced by the scattering operator of a ”structural unit”
in the works [11, 21, 57]. Nevertheless, this approach
doesn’t seem to have any theoretical justiﬁcation.

Hence, we prefer to use the more rigorous approach
introduce in the scattering theory by disorder liquid
metal [38, 39] and adapted in the electromagnetic case
by Tsang et al. [13, 16]. In this approach, the non-local
term [K 2
e ]I is correctly taking into account by av-
ve,ri ,
eraging equations (41) where the correct potential
deﬁned by (39), is used. A system of hierarchic equa-
tions is obtained where correlation functions between two
or more particles are successively introduced. The chain
of equations is closed in using the Quasi-Crystalline Ap-
proximation (QCA), which neglect the ﬂuctuation of the
eﬀective ﬁeld, acting on a particle located at rj, due to a
deviation of a particle located at ri from its average po-
sition [36]. This approximation describes the correlation
between the particles, only with a two-point correlation
function g(ri, rj) = g(||ri − rj||). Under the QC-CPA
scheme, we obtain the following expression for the mass
operator [13, 16, 35, 38, 39]:

Σ(k0, ω) = n Ce,o(k0|k0) ,

If we rewrite the potential (55) under the following form:

(59)

where we have deﬁned a new wave number ˜K 2
s −

a scatterer of permittivity ˜ǫs = ǫs − ǫ1 + ǫe in a medium

s = K 2

As it is described in the previous section, the eﬀec-
tive propagation Ke constant is the root,which has the
smallest imaginary part, of the equation:

K 2

e = K 2

1 + Σ⊥(Ke, ω) ,

(60)

where the mass operator is decomposed under the form
(25). Once the eﬀective wave number Ke obtained, the
eﬀective permittivity is given by:

result with equation (64), we obtain the following
relationship: :

4π f (ˆk|ˆk0) =(I − ˆkˆk)

· te,o(Ke ˆk|Ke ˆk0) · (I − ˆk0 ˆk0) ,

(68)

Our far-ﬁeld approximation consist in neglecting
the longitudinal component and the oﬀ-shell con-
tribution in the operator te,o, and we write:

ǫe(ω) = K 2

e /K 2

vac .

= 4π (I − ˆkˆk) · f (ˆk|ˆk0) · (I − ˆk0 ˆk0) .

where the last equality comes from the properties
(65-66).

• A forward scattering approximation: For scatter-
ers large compared to a wavelength, the scattered
ﬁeld is predominantly in the forward direction (i.e.
|f (ˆk0|ˆk0)| ≫ |f (−ˆk0|ˆk0)|). Our forward approxi-
mation consist in keeping only the contribution of
the amplitude of diﬀusion f (ˆk|ˆk0) in the direction
of the incident wave ˆk0. We write in using the hy-
pothesis (69):

te,o(Ke ˆk|Ke ˆk0) = 4π f (ˆk|ˆk0) ,
≃ 4π f (ˆk0|ˆk0) ,
= 4π (I − ˆk0 ˆk0)f (Ke, ω) ,

with S1(0) = S2(0) given by the Mie theory [2, 4,
5, 58]. It is worth mentioning that the approxima-
tion (72) is also valid for small scatterers (Rayleigh
scatterers). In this case, the scattering amplitude
f (ˆk|ˆk0) doesn’t depend on the direction of the in-
cident and scattered wave vector ˆk and ˆk0, since
we have

te,o(k|k0) = te,o(ω)I .

From equation (68), we show that:

f (ˆk|ˆk0) = f (ˆk0|ˆk0) .

IV. SOME FURTHER APPROXIMATIONS

As it can be guessed, solving numerically the pre-
vious system of equations (51-61) is full of complex-
ities. However, the low frequency limit of this sys-
tem of equation has been obtained analytically and has
shown to be in good agreement with the experimental
results [13, 16]. We have also to mention that the numer-
ical solution of the quasicrystalline approximation (but
without the coherent potential approximation) has been
developed [15, 50].

To reduce the numerical diﬃculties in the system of
equations (51-61), we add two new approximations to
the QC-CPA scheme:

• A far-ﬁeld approximation: For an incident plane

wave:

Ei(r) = Ei(k0) ei k0·r

,

transverse to the propagation direction ˆk0:

where k0 = Ke ˆk0 and ˆk0 · ˆk0 = 1, the scattered
far-ﬁeld, by a particle within a medium of permit-
tivity ǫe(ω), is described by an operator f (ˆk|ˆk0)
such that:

expressed with the operator te,o by:

In using the phase perturbation method in equation
(67), the scattered far-ﬁeld is obtained in function
of the operator te,o(k|k0), and in comparing the

and we also obtain the coeﬃcient f (Ke, ω):

4π f (Ke, ω) = te,o(ω) .

Furthermore, we see from equation (52), that to
zero order in density:

C e,o(k|k0) = te,o(k|k0) ,

(78)

and that the forward approximation (72) applied
to the operator C e,o(k|k0) in the low density limit.

We will suppose that the forward approximation is
valid whatever the order in density for the operator
Ce,o(k|k0) and we write:

that the Dyadic Green function has a singularity which
can be separated in introducing the principal value of the
Green function [15, 16, 55, 59]:

Ce,o(k|k0) ≃ C e,o(k0|k0) ,

With this hypothesis, only the path of type 1 in the
ﬁgure (1) are considered. This approximation also
implied that the operator C e,o(k|k0) is transverse
to the propagation direction ˆk0.

In introducing the approximation (103) in equation (97),
the Dirac distribution provides an analytical answer for
the T matrix of a single particle:

V. RAYLEIGH SCATTERERS

We now show how to recover the low-frequency limit
of the QC-CPA approach. First, we have to ﬁnd an ex-
pression for the T matrix for a single scatterer when its
size is small compared to a wavelength (Kvac rs ≪ 1).
The T matrix te,o veriﬁes the following equation:

It’s easy to recognize that the coeﬃcient αdip is the po-
larization factor of a dipole. Hence, the singularity in the
Green dyadic function describes the depolarization factor
due to the induced ﬁeld in the particles. The relationship
between the singularity of the Green function and the de-
polarization ﬁeld acting on a particle has been described
in numerous works [13, 16, 55, 56, 59, 60, 61, 62]. From
the meaning of the coeﬃcient αdip, we inferred that equa-
tion (97) describes the multiple scattering process by the
dipoles inside the particle (where Θd(r) 6= 0).

As the particles are small compared to a wavelength,

we use a point scatterer approximation:

where the term ΛT is proportional to the inverse of the

a single particle is:

It has been shown that the T matrix (107,108) veriﬁes the
optical theorem and can present a resonant behavior due
to the ΛT term [7, 60]. The validity of the optical theorem
is an important point, to insure that that the attenuation
of the coherent wave due to scattering is correctly taken
into account in the (QC-CPA) approach. Hence, the ex-
pressions (108) must be used rather than the usual T
matrix for a Rayleigh scatterer te,o(Ke, ω) = K 2
vide αdip
which doesn’t verify the optical theorem [7, 16]. Further-
more, from equations (68), we notice that:

4π f (Ke, ω) = te,o(Ke, ω) .

(109)

The small size of the scatterers allow us also to approx-
imate the term m(Ke) in equation (93).
In fact, as
there is no long range correlation in a random medium
(g(r) − 1 ≃ 0 for r ≫ rs) and as Ke rs ≪ 1, we can
evaluate the function p(Ker) in the integral (91) for Ker
close to zero. In using the limit:

p(x) =

+ o(x) x → 0 ,

we obtain the following leading term of the real and imag-

We are now going to show that the relation (93) that we
have obtained contain also the Keller formula [52]. This
formula has recently been shown to be in good agreement
with experimental results for particles larger than a wave-
lengh [53, 54]. The Keller formula can be obtained in con-
sidering the QC-CPA approach in the scalar case [13, 16].
The equations are formerly identical to equation (51-58)

For non resonant Rayleigh scatterers, we can ne-

compare to 1 − fv. Moreover, we
have usually Re(ǫe) ≫ Im(ǫe) and equation (112) can
be simpliﬁed into:

ǫe = ǫ1 +

fvol

where a Percus-Yevick correlation function for g(r)
gives [13, 15]:

w2 =

(1 − fv)4
(1 + 2 fv)2 .

The equation (115) is the usual low-frequency limit of
the QC-CPA approach obtained by Tsang et al. [13, 16].
In particular, we see that in the static-case (ω = 0) the
imaginary term in the right hand side of equation (115)
is null, and if we replace the eﬀective permittivity ǫe by
ǫ1 in the right-hand side of equation (115), we recover
the classical Maxwell Garnett formula:

ǫe = ǫ1 +

3(ǫs − ǫ1) ǫ1 fvol
(ǫs − ǫ1) (1 − fvol) + 3 ǫ1

,

which is usually written in the following form:

ǫe − ǫ1
ǫe + 2ǫ1

= fv

ǫs − ǫ1
ǫs + 2ǫ1

.

In comparing equation (117) and (112), we see that the
scattering process modiﬁed the Maxwell Garnett formula
by adding a new term:

−

As was shown by Waterman et al, this development is
valid if the following condition is veriﬁed:

(4π)2 n |f (Ke, ω)|2/Ke ≪ 1 .

(123)

In the geometric limit, the scattering cross section σs for
a single particle is in good approximation given by σs ≃
2 π r2
s . As the cross section is connected to scattering
amplitude by the relation σs = 8π
3 |f (Ke, ω)|2 and as the
maximum density is n = 1/vs, we see that for particles
larger than a wavelength the condition (123) is satisﬁed:

(4π)2 n |f (Ke, ω)|2/Ke ≃ 1/Ke rs ≪ 1 .

(124)

The equation (122), which has been derived by
Keller [52], has proven to be in good agreement with
experiments for particles larger than a wavelength.
If
we now use a Taylor development in equation (93), we
obtain

This development is valid if the condition (123) is sat-

function p(Ke r) in the deﬁnition (91) of m(Ke), since for
Ke r ≫ 1 we have from equation (92):

We see that equation (127) diﬀer from the equation (122),
only by the factor 1/3K 2
e , which is due to singularity
of the vectorial Green function and consequently cannot
be derived from the scalar theory developed by Keller.
We also remarks that that to solve numerically our new
equation (93), we can use the same procedure that is used
to solve the original Keller formula (122) with the Muller
theory [54]. Consequently, we have derived a numerical
tractable approximation to the (QC-CPA) scheme.

VII. CONCLUSION

The intent of this paper has been to establish a new
formula for the eﬀective dielectric constant which charac-
terize the coherent part of an electromagnetic wave prop-
agating in a random medium. The starting point of our
theory has been the quasicrystalline coherent potential
approximation which takes into account the correlation
between the particles. As the numerical calculation of
the eﬀective permittivity is still a diﬃcult task under

9

the (QC-CPA) approach, we have added a far-ﬁeld and a
forward scattering approximations to (QC-CPA) scheme.
In the low frequency limit, equation is identical with the
usual result obtained under the (QC-CPA) scheme, and
in the high frequency limit the expression include the gen-
eralization, in the vectorial case, of the result obtained
by Keller. Further study is necessary to assess the lim-
itation of this approach on the intermediate frequency
regime.

Abstract

Scattering processes in an optical microcavity are investigated for the case of silicon nanocrystals

embedded in an ultra-high Q toroid microcavity. Using a novel measurement technique based on

the observable mode-splitting, we demonstrate that light scattering is highly preferential: more

than 99.8% of the scattered photon ﬂux is scattered into the original doubly-degenerate cavity

modes. The large capture eﬃciency is attributed to the enhancement of the optical density of

states over the free space value and has the same origin as the Purcell eﬀect in spontaneous

emission. The experimentally determined Purcell factor amounts to 883. We predict that in any

materials system, optical scattering can be reduced in an optical microcavity.

Optical microcavities conﬁne light both temporally and spatially and ﬁnd application in

a variety of applied and fundamental studies, such as photonics, cavity quantum electrody-

namics, nonlinear optics and sensing[1]. In nearly all embodiments of microcavities, such as

microdisks, microspheres, micropillars or photonic crystals, sub-wavelength defect centers

are present, either caused by intrinsic material irregularities, fabrication imperfection or

intentionally induced (such as quantum dots). The concomitant refractive index perturba-

tions lead to scattering, which increases the cavity loss rate. In this manuscript we analyze

the eﬀect of scattering in an optical microcavity and demonstrate a novel phenomenon:

The enhanced density of states in the microcavity strongly supresses scattering losses. We

demonstrate this eﬀect for a toroid microcavity containing silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) as

scattering centers. Using a novel measurement technique we demonstrate that light scatter-

ing is highly preferential; 99.8% of all scattered light is scattered into the original eigenmodes

(a more than two-order of magnitude reduction with respect to bulk scattering losses). This

value cannot be explained by the existing geometrical optics theory[2]. A novel theoretical

analysis shows that the observed modiﬁed scattering rate into the original cavity mode is

due to the enhancement of the optical density of states (DOS) over the free space value, and

therefore has the same origin as the Purcell-eﬀect in spontaneous emission. The presented

experimental and theoretical results establish the signiﬁcance of the Purcell-factor for scat-

tering processes within a microcavity and constitute the highest experimentally measured

Purcell factor to date (883).

It is a well known phenomenon [2, 3, 4] that the resonances of whispering gallery mode

(WGM) microcavities such as droplets, microspheres, microtoroids or microdisks appear as

doublets. The doublet splitting is due to lifting of the two-fold degeneracy of the clockwise

(CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) whispering-gallery-modes (WGMs) that occurs when

these modes are coupled due to scattering, either by intrinsic or surface inhomogeneities.

In the Rayleigh limit (particle radius r ≪ λ), this leads a scattered power P per unit solid
4πǫ k4 |~p|2 cos2(θ), with ǫ the dielectric constant of the medium, k
angle Ω as given by dP
the magnitude of the wave vector, and θ the scattering angle. As discussed in reference [2]

dΩ = 1

this leads to doublet splitting due to lifting of the CW and CCW mode degeneracy, since

part of the scattered light is channeled back into the original pair of eigenmodes, leading

to an observable mode splitting. In what follows, it is analyzed how the observable mode

spitting can be used to infer the capture eﬃciency (η), which is deﬁned as the fraction of

2

light scattered into the original eigenmodes (and which, therefore, does not contribute to

cavity losses). For a single nanoparticle scattering cross section σscat, and a number density

N, the total scattering rate is given by γ

−1
tot = σscatN c

n where c is the speed of light. The

mode splitting (in the frequency domain) is then given by

The factor of 1

2 takes into account that the scattering of light into original eigenmodes
(i.e., self-coupling) does not contribute to the observed mode splitting. Owing to the small

size of the scattering centers in comparison to the wavelength of light, it is assumed that

scattering is equally divided into CW and CCW direction. The dissipation rate of light not

scattered into the cavity mode is given by:

γ−1 =

ηγ−1
tot

2

τ −1 = (1 − η)γ−1
tot

In addition, 1/τ 0 will describe losses associated with absorption, and the cumulative eﬀect

of these processes (1/τ 0 + 1/τ ) causes a reduction in cavity Q. The degree to which the

scattering process couples the initially degenerate cavity modes can be described by the

modal coupling parameter Γ [4], which can be expressed by:

Γ =

τ

(cid:18)

Γ thus reﬂects the relative “visibility” of the doublet as appearing in the under-coupled

resonance spectrum; measurement of this parameter is described in detail in refs. [3, 4].

The capture eﬃciency η can be retrieved from Γ as follows. In the presence of other loss

channels, such as residual material absorption, two limits of Eq. 3 can be considered. First,
if the cavity losses are dominated by absorption,i.e. τ −1

tot, Eq. 3 simpliﬁes to:

0 ≫ (1 − η)γ−1

i.e. the doublet visibility, measured for diﬀerent cavity modes, increases linearly with intrin-

sic Q (if scattering is constant for all modes). In this regime, a lower bound of the capture
eﬃciency η can be found, given by η > 2γtotΓ
which τ −1

. Second, in the scattering-limited case, for

tot it follows from Eq. 3 that:

In this regime an improved lower bound of the capture eﬃciency η can be inferred from

measurements of Γ (with the accuracy given by the amount residual absorption). Signiﬁ-

cantly, in the case where the residual absorption (i.e. τ 0) is known and is identical for all

cavity modes (i.e. an intrinsic property of the resonator) η can be inferred exactly. It can

then be determined by measuring Γ for modes with various amounts of scattering (γtot), and

inferring η via the functional relation of Γ(Q, γtot) as given by Eq. 3.

To test the above model, we have investigated the scattering processes of SiO2 toroid mi-

crocavities. These microcavities exhibit ultra-high-Q whispering-gallery type modes [5], and

can be used as ultralow threshold chip based Raman lasers, optical parametric oscillators,

or erbium microlasers. Details on fabrication and on the coupling technique (using tapered

optical ﬁbers) can be found in Refs.[5, 6]

Figure 1 shows measurement of the Γ-parameter for an undoped SiO2 50-µm-diameter

toroid microcavity, measured for successive fundamental resonances with diﬀerent Q in the

1550 nm band. A cavity resonance scan is shown in the upper right panel of Fig. 1, and

shows the typical doublet splitting of ˜10 MHz observed for pure SiO2 toroids. The data

in the main panel of Fig. 1 clearly follow a linear relationship, indicating that the cavity

resonances follow absorption-limited behavior (attributed to adsorbed water and OH on the
surface of the toroid[7]). The scattering rate γ−1/2π derived from the data is plotted in the

lower right ﬁgure (as Qsplit = ωγ), and is indeed to a very good approximation the same for

all modes. From the highest observed doublet splitting (Γ = 28) the lower estimate of the

capture eﬃciency is η > 96.4%. This value cannot be explained by the quasi-geometrical

estimations of Ref.

[2] which predict a maximum capture eﬃciency of 90%. This model

assumes that scattered light obeys a Rayleigh-type angular distribution, and can couple

back into the CW and CCW modes, provided the scattering angle θ is within the critical

angle φ of the mode i.e. θ<φ. This model, while adequate to describe losses of a waveguide-

bend, is (as will be shown below), incomplete as it neglects the periodic nature of light

scattering in a microcavity.

To infer the capture eﬃciency more exactly, measurements were performed in the

scattering-limited regime, by fabricating SiO2 toroid micro-cavities doped with Si NCs. Si

NCs exhibit quantum-conﬁned photoluminescence (PL) in the visible and near-infrared,

and have various potential applications in photonic and electronic devices[8]. Si NCs do not

posses signiﬁcant absorption transitions at λ = 1.5 µm and have a high refractive index

4

relative to the SiO2 matrix (n = 3.48 vs. n = 1.44) and thus act (in the 1550-nm band)

as strong scattering centers. The Si NC doped cavities were made by ion-implantation of
900 keV Si+ ions (ﬂuence 9.1 × 1016 cm−2) into a thermally oxidized Si wafer (2 µm oxide),

followed by annealing[9] and toroid fabrication. In order to conﬁrm the presence of Si NCs

after fabrication, 2-D cross-sectional PL images were measured using a confocal imaging mi-

croscope (using a rhodamine doped index matching oil). Figure 2(a) shows a cross sectional

image of the integrated PL in the 650 − 690 nm band, taken in the toroid’s equatorial plane.

A bright luminescent ring is observed, characteristic of quantum-conﬁned emission from Si

NCs embedded in the toroid. The emission spectrum (cf. Fig.2) peaks at λ = 675 nm,

corresponding to a NC diameter of ∼3 nm. A cross sectional image of the toroid’s minor

ring is shown in Fig. 2 ( resolution of 400 × 850 nm). Clear NC PL is again observed inside

the toroidal ring. The outer PL ring in Fig. 2 corresponds to emission from the rhodamine

dye adsorbed onto the surface, and serves to determine the cavities’ outer contour. We ﬁnd

that while the NC PL is inhomogeneously distributed, Si NC PL is observed throughout the

entire toroidal volume.

The optical resonances of Si NC doped microcavities exhibited splitting frequencies as

large as 1 GHz, nearly two orders of magnitude larger than for the undoped SiO2 toroids.

This conﬁrms that scattering centers (here Si NCs) are responsible for the observed strong

modal coupling (i.e. Γ ≫ 1). The highest observed modal coupling parameter was Γ = 50.

Correspondingly, according to Eq. 5, the capture eﬃciency is η > 98%. Thus despite strong

scattering from the NCs, long photon storage times are still achievable. Indeed, Q-factors

> 107 are observed for most measured resonances.

In order to obtain an even more exact value of the capture eﬃciency, two diﬀerent sets

of transverse cavity modes (attributed to the radial mode index n = 1 and n = 2) were

characterized with progressing angular mode numbers (ℓ, ℓ + 1, ℓ + 2, ...). Due to the in-

homogeneous distribution of the NCs (cf. Fig. 2), these modes are dominated by diﬀering

levels of scattering. However, due to the presence of water and OH adsorbed onto the cavity

surface, each set of radial modes experiences the same amount of residual absorption. Γ

and Q measurements for each of these resonances are shown in Fig. 3 where the splitting

frequency is expressed as splitting quality factor Qsplit = ωγ. The solid line in Fig. 3 is a

two-parameter (η and τ 0 ) ﬁt of Eq. 3 applied to the high-Q experimental data (attributed

to the n = 1 radial modes), and excellent agreement is obtained for η = 99.42% (±0.04%)

5

and τ 0 = 115 ns (±3 ns) (i.e.Q0 = 1.4 × 108). The deviation between ﬁt and data for the

lower-Q data is attributed to higher-order radial modes (n = 2), which possess increased

intrinsic (OH and water) absorption losses, owing to their slower decaying ﬁeld amplitude

outside the cavity. The mode identiﬁcation is also consistent with the inhomogeneous distri-

bution of NCs, which causes increased scattering for higher order radial modes (cf. Fig. 2).

These modes follow absorption-limited Q behavior, represented by a constant Qscat, (and

a linear dependence of Γ(Q), see inset Fig. 3). The inferred intrinsic cavity lifetime τ 0 is

in good quantitative agreement with recent estimates of the absorption loss due to water

adsorbed onto the cavity surface.[7] The remarkably high capture eﬃciency of 99.42% found

here clearly demonstrates that optical scattering in microcavities occurs preferentially into

cavity eigenmodes.

This observation can be understood by the following qualitative reasoning. For a sin-

gle nanoparticle coupled to a microcavity mode, the temporal conﬁnement of light implies

periodic scattering with the temporal periodicity given by the cavity round-trip time. Con-

versely, one can treat the problem as scattering by a chain of M equidistantly spaced scatter-

ing centers (spatial periodicity of L = 2πR). The incident optical ﬁeld will induce a dipole

moment ~p, which is in phase at each scattering site. The number (M) of excited dipoles is

approximately given by the cavity lifetime divided by the round trip time (T ) i.e.

M ˜=

τ c
2πnef f R

(6)

This problem can be recognized as 1-D scattering of a periodic lattice and is well known

in solid state physics or diﬀractive optics. The interference of all M scattering centers,

leads to a scattering intensity (i.e. diﬀraction pattern) with a width of the corresponding
principal diﬀraction maxima as given by: ∆θ = 2π

M . Therefore, the on-axis scattering rate is
enhanced by the cavity by a factor of M, compared to the peak scattering rate of a single

emitter (dipole) in free space i.e.

super-radiance[10] and pertains both to an atomic (quantum) dipole as well as to a classical

system of radiators. Note that M is proportional to Q/Vm where Vm is the mode volume.

This motivates a second interpretation, by considering the eﬀect of DOS in the scattering

process.

If we consider ~Ed to be the dipole ﬁeld, then the probability of scattering into a des-

6

ignated plane wave with wave vector ~k and polarization ~σ is proportional to the integral
~Ek,σ · ~EddV .[11] The total scattering rate is obtained by summation over all possible

ǫ

modes. Correspondingly, if the DOS is altered – e.g. due to the presence of a cavity – the

R

emission into certain modes is enhanced, while emission into others is suppressed. The en-

hancement of scattering is therefore given by the ratio of the optical DOS in the microcavity

to the value of free space, which at resonance is given by[12]

i.e. the well known Purcell factor. An explicit mathematical derivation of the enhancement

as outlined here has also been undertaken and will be communicated elsewhere.

Note that an excited atom within a high-Q microcavity (in the regime of weak coupling),

will also preferentially emit into the cavity mode. This is referred to as the Purcell eﬀect,

and the corresponding shortening of the spontaneous emission (SE) lifetime is given by the

Purcell factor as ﬁrst proposed in Ref. [12]. Note that the origin of preferential emission for

an atomic and a classical dipole are identical; for an atom the enhancement of SE follows

from classical electrodynamics, and results from the enhanced DOS of the vacuum ﬁeld[13].

Furthermore, atomic SE enhancement can be interpreted in terms of a chain of radiating

dipoles (as done here in the case of scattering) when using the image method, which replaces

the cavity mirrors (in case of a Fabry- P´erot cavity) by an inﬁnite chain of image dipoles[14].

Having established the relation of preferential scattering and the optical density of states,

we can now relate the capture eﬃciency η to the Purcell factor via:

(7)

(8)

as in the case of an atomic emitter (β factor). The experimentally found value of η = 99.42

±0.04% (cf. Fig. 3) then corresponds to a Purcell factor F = 172 ± 10. This represents the

highest measured value of this parameter to date. Theoretically, the Purcell factor for the

toroid microcavities used in the experiments (Q = 1.3 × 108, D = 72µm , Aef f = 14µm2)

equals F = 2060, corresponding to η = 99.95%. The discrepancy between this and the

experimentally found value is likely to be caused by the presence of minute absorption

(originating from defect-related mid-gap states, or from two-photon absorption in the Si

equivalent Purcell factor is F = 883 (+484/ − 229) and is in better agreement with the

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

theoretical prediction. The remaining discrepancy is attributed to the fact that scattering

centers located at diﬀerent positions in the toroid experience the local density of states,

which is lower than the value given by eqs. 7. Therefore the measured value corresponds to

the local D.O.S averaged over the spatial distribution of the scattering centers.

In conclusion, we have analyzed and determined for the ﬁrst time the capture eﬃciency

of scattered light in an optical micro-cavity. For a toroidal microcavity doped with silicon

nanocrystals, 99.89% of the scattered light is preferentially scattered into a cavity mode,

leading to a reduction of plane-wave bulk scattering losses by more than two orders of

magnitude. This enhancement is found to be related to the enhancement of the density of

states over the free space value, as given by the Purcell-factor, and is a intrinsic property of

any microcavity.

We have measured -3.5 dB (-8.1 dB corrected for losses) relative intensity squeezing between the probe and
conjugate beams generated by stimulated, nondegenerate four-wave mixing in hot rubidium vapor. Unlike
early observations of squeezing in atomic vapors based on saturation of a two-level system, our scheme uses
a resonant nonlinearity based on ground-state coherences in a three-level system. Since this scheme produces
narrowband, squeezed light near an atomic resonance it is of interest for experiments involving cold atoms or
atomic ensembles.

Twenty years ago, the pioneering work of Slusher,
et al. led to the ﬁrst experimental demonstration of a
squeezed state of light, using four-wave mixing (4WM)
in sodium vapor.1 Since that time, many groups have
demonstrated squeezing based on 4WM in atomic va-
pors under a variety of diﬀerent conditions2, 3

Despite the breadth of these experimental results,
4WM in atomic vapors has never generated large
amounts of squeezing. To our knowledge, the highest
reported level of squeezing from atomic-vapor 4WM is
-2.2 dB,3 using cold atoms in a cavity. This is in marked
contrast to systems based on 4WM in optical ﬁbers,
for which relative intensity squeezing of up to -4.6 dB
(−10.3 dB after loss correction) has been observed.4 Sys-
tems based on parametric down-conversion (PDC) have
been even more successful, generating better than -9 dB
(measured) of relative intensity squeezing.5, 6

It has been suggested that squeezing from 4WM in
atomic vapors is limited by spontaneous emission noise
when the nonlinearity is based on coherences between
levels separated by optical transitions.7 A large num-
ber of recent experiments have demonstrated the power
of atomic-vapor 4WM using nonlinearities based on
ground-state coherences, in which coherent population
trapping and electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) can reduce or eliminate spontaneous emission
noise. Of particular relevance to this work, classical noise
correlations in such a Λ system were measured in sodium
vapor8 and 4WM in this system was predicted to gen-
erate squeezing.9, 10 Approximately -0.2 dB of squeezing
has been demonstrated in a Λ system in rubidium va-
por.11

Inspired by these results and motivated by the desire
to produce correlated photons that can interact with
laser-cooled atoms to produce correlated atom-optical
beams12, 13 we have revisited the question of squeezing
generated by 4WM in atomic vapors. In this Letter, we
report the demonstration of -3.5 dB (-8.1 dB corrected)
of relative intensity squeezing between the probe and
conjugate beams produced in a seeded, nearly coprop-
agating, nondegenerate 4WM scheme in hot rubidium
vapor. Our system does not involve a cavity or cold

atoms and has a single-pass net optical gain of only
∼ 4. We anticipate that further experimental improve-
ments to the system could produce signiﬁcantly greater
squeezing, perhaps making atomic-vapor 4WM compet-
itive with optical ﬁbers and PDC-based systems as a
source of squeezed light.

Our experiment begins with two Ti:Sapphire lasers
tuned to the D1 line of rubidium (795 nm). We use
350 mW of light from one as a pump beam, and up to
0.2 mW of light from the other as a probe. We com-
bine the pump and probe beams with crossed linear
polarizations and send them into a natural-abundance
rubidium vapor cell heated to 125 C (atomic density
∼ 3 × 1013cm−3) with no magnetic shielding. The beams
cross at a small angle (∼0.75 degrees) and the cell is
tilted at Brewster’s angle (∼8 mm path length) to min-
imize reﬂection losses for the probe polarization. (See
Fig. 1.) The pump beam waist is 600 µm while the probe
beam waist is 350 µm. After the cell the pump beam is
ﬁltered out using a Glan-Taylor polarizer, with a dis-

1

crimination of ∼ 105:1.

With the pump detuned ∼1 GHz to the blue of the
85Rb F=2 → F’ transition, we scan the probe by 12 GHz
across the D1 line and observe a number of transmission
features (see Fig. 1). The most prominent are two probe
intensity gain peaks, at the 85Rb ground-state hyperﬁne
splitting of 3 GHz to the red and blue of the pump detun-
ing. These are due to forward 4WM gain. The probe gain
is accompanied by the generation of a conjugate beam
with detuning from the pump opposite to that of the
probe, polarization parallel to the probe, and propaga-
tion direction at the same pump-probe angle but on the
opposite side of the pump. The slight dispersive charac-
ter of the redder of the two 4WM gain features is caused
by a competition between Raman absorption, EIT, and
the 4WM gain. The absorptive feature at -2.5 GHz is
6.8 GHz to the red of the pump detuning, and is due to
Raman absorption in the 87Rb atoms.

In order to measure the relative intensity noise be-
tween the probe and conjugate, we switch to a phase-
locked probe beam of the same waist, generated by
double-passing a small
fraction of the pump light
through a 1.5 GHz acousto-optic modulator. We then
calibrate the standard quantum limit (SQL) “shot noise”
of our system by picking oﬀ the probe before the cell,
splitting it with a 50/50 beamsplitter, and directing the
resulting beams into a balanced, ampliﬁed photodetector
with a transimpedance gain of 105V/A and 82% quan-
tum eﬃciency. We measure the spectrum of electrical
noise power of the photodetector output voltage on a
spectrum analyzer set to a 300 kHz resolution bandwidth
and a 100 Hz video bandwidth. The balanced detection
technique subtracts away common-mode noise to bet-
ter than 25 dB. The balanced photodetector noise level
is a measure of the SQL for the total amount of opti-
cal power arriving at the photodetector. The shot noise
should be independent of frequency, which is indeed the
case within the bandwidth of our detection electronics,
which begins to roll oﬀ above 3 MHz. For a total power
of 180 µW (90 µW out of each port) the measured SQL
is -68 dBm (see Fig. 2).

Next, with a pump detuning of 750 MHz and the probe
tuned 3.03 GHz to the red, the light is redirected through
the atoms. Under these conditions the probe has a gain
g = 4. As a seeded process the probe and conjugate
should have a power ratio of g/(g − 1). In the absence of
the pump, the absorption of the probe is ∼ 7%, while the
absorption at the conjugate detuning is negligible. Due
to this diﬀerential absorption the probe and conjugate
emerge from the cell with the same power to within 10%.
We direct these beams onto the balanced photodetector
and measure the noise-power spectrum. For a total op-
tical power (probe plus conjugate) of 180 µW, the noise
power is as much as 3.5 dB below the SQL for frequencies
from 300 kHz to ∼4 MHz (see Fig. 2).

To better quantify the degree of squeezing we measure
the relative probe-conjugate noise power at 1 MHz as a
function of the total optical power impinging on the pho-

todetector, and compare it with the 50/50 beamsplitter
SQL measurement as described above, for various powers
(see Fig. 3). Fitting both the 4WM and SQL noise power
curves to straight lines, we ﬁnd that the probe and con-
jugate relative intensity noise is 3.5 dB below the SQL.
Using a model for twin-beam losses14, 15 we correct for
our detector eﬃciency (82%) and the transmission of the
optical path from the atoms to the detector (80%), re-
sulting in a noise power 8.1+1.4
−1.0 dB below the SQL before
the exit window of the cell. This is limited by both the
(asymmetric) absorption in the cell and the imbalance
due to the injected probe light.

We next measure the noise properties of the individual
probe and conjugate beams after the cell, by blocking one
and then the other. The resulting noise spectra are nearly
identical, and show increased noise above the SQL (see
Fig. 2). Since the probe and conjugate alone have only
half the total optical power, the correct SQL with which
to compare them is lower by 3 dB (-71 dBm), since SQL
noise power scales linearly with optical power. At 1 MHz
the probe and conjugate alone each have 7.6 times more
noise than the SQL. The net probe intensity gain is 4 at
the end of the vapor. If the 4WM system were operating
as a perfect quantum-noise-limited ampliﬁer with this
gain (and correcting for losses) we would expect only 4.9
times the SQL with a shot-noise-limited input probe.

As a ﬁnal experimental check, we tune the probe
3.03 GHz to the blue of the pump, coinciding with the
blue 4WM gain peak. For this conﬁguration the probe

and conjugate display relative intensity noise reduction
of only about 2.5 dB. This is consistent with the fact
that the conjugate beam now experiences more absorp-
tion than the probe, leading to less well-balanced optical
powers on the detector.

Our 4WM conﬁguration is related to that discussed by
Lukin and coworkers,10 with probe and conjugate pho-
tons playing complementary roles in the atomic prepa-
ration and photon scattering from the atomic coherence.
Previous experiments working with the Λ scheme have
tended to operate at low power and near resonance. The
experiments reported here, however, operate in a dif-
ferent regime and combine a number of features used
individually in previous investigations of Λ systems, in-
cluding a nearly copropagating geometry, a very large
Rabi frequency for the pump laser (Ωpump ≈ 100Γ),
and a large detuning. Furthermore, the choice of cross-
polarization of the pump and probe reduces the reab-
sorption, since it leads to optimal EIT on the D1 line of
rubidium by creating a dark state that simultaneously
satisﬁes multiple Λ transitions.16

The phase stability of the pump and probe beam ap-
pears to be an important but not critical issue; we were
able to observe nearly the same amount of squeezing by
using independent pump and probe lasers, although with
a phase-locked pump and probe the spectrum of squeez-
ing was extended to lower frequencies by about 250 kHz.
We intend to explore further EIT improvements with
magnetic shielding and buﬀer gases, as well as single-
isotope cells of 85Rb, which should allow us greater free-
dom in detuning. In addition, by pumping on the tran-
sitions that we used here as the probe and conjugate,
it should be possible to produce degenerate twin beams
and quadrature squeezing. These photons would be nar-
rowband and at a frequency required for cold atom ex-
periments.

In conclusion, we have measured -3.5 dB (-8.1 dB cor-
rected for losses) relative intensity squeezing in forward

four-wave-mixing in hot atomic vapor, in a simple system
without a cavity or feedback loops. This system promises
to be an important source of narrowband squeezed light
near atomic transitions.

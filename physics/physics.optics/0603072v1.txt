We consider propagation of a paraxial beam carrying the spin angular momentum (polarization)
and intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) in a smoothly inhomogeneous isotropic medium.
It is shown that the presence of IOAM can dramatically enhance and rearrange the topological
phenomena that previously were considered solely in connection to the polarization of transverse
waves. In particular, the appearance of a new-type Berry phase that describes the parallel transport
of the beam structure along a curved ray is predicted. We derive the ray equations demonstrating the
splitting of beams with diﬀerent values of IOAM. This is the orbital angular momentum Hall eﬀect,
which resembles Magnus eﬀect for optical vortices. Unlike the recently discovered spin Hall eﬀect of
photons, it can be much larger in magnitude and is inherent to waves of any nature. Experimental
means to detect the phenomena is discussed.

Introduction. The total angular momentum (TAM)
of an electromagnetic wave packet
(or a beam)
can be presented in the form of three summands:
TAM=EOAM+IOAM+SAM. Here IOAM stands for the
intrinsic orbital angular momentum of the packet, i.e. the
orbital angular momentum relative to the center of grav-
ity of the packet, EOAM is the extrinsic orbital angular
momentum related to the motion of the center of gravity,
and SAM is the spin angular momentum determined by
the polarization of the wave packet. While EOAM and
SAM are well known and studied during many decades,
the beams carrying IOAM evoked intensive theoretical
and experimental investigations only in last 14 years [1].
This fact is connected to the contemporary laboratory
resources for the generation and transformation of light
beams as well as single photons with non-zero values of
IOAM. The most popular beams with IOAM are the
Laguerre–Gaussian beams which contain the optical vor-
tices along their axes and form a complete, orthogonal,
basic set from which an arbitrary ﬁeld distribution can
de described. The states of light with well-deﬁned IOAM
oﬀer now exciting possibilities for the optical manipula-
tion with matter, study of the entanglement of photons,
and a lot of problems of the classical electrodynamics [1].

Simultaneously,

in the past decade, the topological
phenomena related to the spin of particles caused a great
activity in the various areas of physics: condensed mat-

fundamental character of the problems and promising ap-
plications in new areas of nanotechnologies, such as spin-
tronics, photonics, etc. Nontrivial evolution of the spin
states in the semiclassical approximation can be treated
by means of the spin-orbit interaction, which is the cou-
pling between SAM and EOAM. Spin-orbit interaction
leads to the mutual inﬂuence of the polarization and the
trajectory of the particle’s motion, and produces two re-

ciprocal topological phenomena. These are the geomet-
rical Berry phase [2,3] and recently discovered topolog-
ical spin transport or intrinsic spin Hall eﬀect [4].
In
the geometrical optics, the Berry phase provides for the
parallel transport of the polarization vector along the
ray [3], whereas the spin Hall eﬀect manifests itself as
the transverse deﬂection of polarized beams when prop-
agating in an inhomogeneous medium. The latter phe-
nomenon includes the polarization-dependent transverse
Fedorov–Imbert shift in the reﬂection or refraction of the
beam on a sharp boundary [5,6,8,10], and the splitting of
rays of diﬀerent polarizations in a smoothly inhomoge-
neous medium [6–9]. The common roots of these eﬀects
and their connection to the spin-orbit interaction and
TAM conservation are indicated in the papers [6,8,10].

All mentioned phenomena are related to the interac-
tion between the polarization of light (SAM of the ﬁeld)
and its extrinsic orbital features, EOAM. At the same
time, the presence of the IOAM in the beam apparently
may lead to analogous eﬀects. Then large values of IOAM
can give a great advantage compared to small polariza-
tion phenomena constrained by unit value of SAM per
photon (¯h = 1). The transverse Fedorov–Imbert shift re-
lated to IOAM has been recently described and measured
In the present paper, similarly to the developed

[6–9], we evolve the geometrical optics with the orbit-
orbit interaction, i.e., an interaction between IOAM and
EOAM of the beam propagating along a curved ray.

Berry connection and curvature. We consider a
monochromatic paraxial electromagnetic beam with def-
inite values of SAM and IOAM, which propagates in a
smoothly inhomogeneous isotropic medium. Locally, the
beam’s electric ﬁeld (without e−iωt factor) can be repre-
sented as in homogeneous medium:

Ep,l,σ = eσF p,|l| (ρ) exp [ilϕ + iks] .

Here k is the central wave vector directed along the beam
axis; (ρ, ϕ, s) are the local cylindrical coordinates follow-
ing the central ray whose trajectory is described by the
geometrical optics ray equations; eσ is the unit vector
of the polarization of wave with the helicity σ = ±1
which is the value of s-directed SAM per photon (e±

tions, so that e±∗ = e∓ and eσ†eσ
); F p,|l| is the
radial function with quantum number p = 0, 1, 2, ...; ﬁ-
nally, l = 0, ±1, ..., ±p is the azimuthal quantum number
which is the value of s-directed IOAM per photon. The
expression (1) is given in a diﬀractionless approximation
and does not account for variations of the beam’s enve-
lope, phase front, and the Guoy phase; as it is known,
the diﬀraction phenomena do not contribute to the ge-
ometrical optics characteristics of the wave packet evo-
lution. In the paraxial approximation one can consider
the longintudinal wave vector k as independent of the
transverse structure of the wave ﬁeld and the polariza-
tion vector eσ as common for the whole beam. This is
the paraxial approximation that enables one to consider
the states of ﬁeld with simultaneously well-deﬁned val-
ues of the helicity (SAM) and IOAM [1]. The axis of
the beam (1) contains an optical dislocation (the phase
singularity): the optical vortex of the strength l. The
scalar product for beams (1) is deﬁned as for vectors
in Hilbert space, with integration over the beam cross-
section; we assume that beams (1) form an orthonor-

Thus, the Berry connection for beams (1) is also a diag-
onal Abelian potential represented by a tensor of higher
rank. Propagation in a smoothly inhomogeneous medium
keeps the beam’s helicity, σ, and IOAM, l, conserved in
the geometrical optics approximation. Hence, the Berry
connection and curvature for a given beam (1) equal
Aσl = (σ + l) A and F σl = (σ + l) F = − (σ + l) k/k3.
Thus, topologically, a beam with IOAM behaves similarly
to a polarized beam containing only SAM; however, the
magnitude of the phenomena changes: instead of SAM,
σ, now they are proportional to the total intrinsic angu-
lar momentum of the beam: SAM+IOAM, σ + l. First,
this can dramatically enhance some topological eﬀects,
since the value of l can reach tens and even hundreds.
Second, in contrast to situations considered previously,
the nontrivial topological features can be manifested by
beams without SAM, σ = 0, in particular by beams of
longitudinal (sound) waves with l 6= 0.

Geometrical phase and parallel transport of the beam
structure. We proceed to describe the basic phenom-
ena arising from the Berry connection (3). It is known
that during the beam evolution it acquires an additional
phase, namely, the Berry geometrical phase that equals

Θσl

B =

Aσldk = (σ + l)

A dk = (σ + l) ΘB0,

(4)

Z
C

Z
C

where C is the contour of the ray evolution in the k-
space, and ΘB0 is the Berry phase accumulated in the
beam with σ = 1 and l = 0. For a cyclic evolution in
the k-space, when C is a loop, the Berry phase can be
represented as a surface integral of the Berry curvature:
F dk = − (σ + l) Ω, where C = ∂S, and
Θσl

B = (σ + l)

Ω is the solid angle at which contour C is seen from
the origin k = 0. With the Berry phase (4) taken into
account, the ﬁeld (1) of the beam propagating along a
curved ray should be rewritten as

HS

Ep,l,σ = eσeiσΘB0 F p,|l| exp [il (ϕ + ΘB0) + iks] .

(5)

Here factor eiσΘB0 is the known Berry phase associated
with the parallel transport of the polarization vector [3],
while the new-type ‘orbital’ Berry phase, incorporated
into the azimuthal distribution, shows that on the evolu-
tion, the transverse distribution of the ﬁeld rotates at the
angle −ΘB0, which corresponds to the parallel transport
of the beam structure along the ray. It follows from Eq.
(5) that an arbitrary electromagnetic beam representable
as a superposition of beams (1), e.g. a Hermite–Gaussian
beam, will also experience a rotation at the angle −ΘB0
in accordance with the parallel transport law, Fig. 1
[12]. The rotation of the transverse intensity distribu-
tion in the beam can be observed in propagation of a
Hermite–Gaussian beam along a helical ray in an axially
symmetric medium or in a circular multimode optical

trinsic orbital angular momentum Hall eﬀect.
Indeed,
the splitting of beams (5) with diﬀerent (opposite) val-
ues of l implies the appearance of the transverse current
of IOAM (Fig. 2) [16]. Various examples of media, where
the orbital angular momentum Hall eﬀect gives rise to no-
ticeable transport of rays, can be found in papers [7–9]
dealing with the analogous spin transport. Let us em-
phasize once more that the transport described by Eqs.
(6) can be: (i) independent of the polarization, and (ii) l
times greater in magnitude then the spin transport.

Since the center of the beam (1) is a vortex core, Eqs.
(6) can be regarded as the equations for the ﬁeld disloca-
tion line in an inhomogeneous medium. Then, deﬂection
δrσl strongly resembles the eﬀect of Magnus force acting
on a vortex in superconductors, where it also directly re-
lated to the Berry phase but in r- rather than k-space
[17] (see also [14]). Association with the vortex core gives
a great opportunity for measuring δrσl, since the singu-
larity can be observed with a great accuracy.

TAM conservation and Fedorov–Imbert shift. TAM of
the paraxial beam (1) (including EOAM) can be repre-
sented in the form J = r × k + (σ + l) k/k. It can be
easily shown [4,8], that it is the Berry curvature term
in the equations of motion (6) that guarantees conser-
vation of Jz in an axially symmetrical with respect to z
axis medium, as well as conservation of J in a medium
spherically symmetric with respect to the origin. The
conservation of TAM of the beam reveals the common na-
ture of the transport under consideration and the trans-
verse Fedorov–Imbert shift at a sharp interface between
two media. The latter problem has been analyzed rig-
orously for paraxial beams with IOAM in [11]. When
a Laguerre–Gaussian beam experiences scattering at the
interface with a low contrast δn ≪ 1, the reﬂected beam
can be neglected, and the transverse shift of the refracted
beam approximately equals [11] δx ≈ (σ+l)
δn
n tan ϑ. Here
ϑ is the angle of incidence, and x axis points orthogo-
nally to both k and the normal to the interface (∇n).
Precisely the above shift provides for conservation of the
normal component of J [5,8,10]. In the diﬀerential limit,
δn → dn, δx → dx, it leads to the ray equations (6) in a
smoothly inhomogeneous medium, see [6].

unit state vector in the basis of beams (1) [1]. Then,
one can determine the expected value of any quantity
for the superposition state. Since the Berry gauge ﬁeld
is Abelian, the transition to the expected values is real-
ized in a straightforward way. The ray equations for ex-
pected values, ¯r and ¯k, (which are the coordinates of the
center of gravity of the total beam in the phase space),

modes of the ﬁber have the form of Eq. (1) [13,14] and,
hence, the speckle pattern at the output of the ﬁber will
rotate depending on its torsion [15].
In the ﬁber, the
eigen modes (1) experience no diﬀraction, which will be
helpful when detecting the eﬀect [12].

Ray equations: spin and orbital Hall eﬀects. The ray
equations, which describe the motion of the center of
the beam (5) in a smoothly inhomogeneous medium, are
Hamiltonian semiclassical equations of motion. They
have been derived a number of times for various parti-
cles in the presence of the Berry curvature in the k-space
[2,4,6–9]. Completely similarly to the case of the spin-
related Berry curvature [6–9], we obtain:

where dot denotes the derivative with respect to s, and
n(r) is the refractive index of the medium. Equations
(6) diﬀer from the ‘traditional’ ray equations of the ge-
ometrical optic by the term proportional to the Berry
curvature in the right-hand side of the second equa-
tion. This term is referred to as “anomalous veloc-
ity” (since it contributes to ˙r) [4]; it describes the ray
deﬂection, δrσl, which crucially depends on the polar-
ization and IOAM of the beam, Fig. 2. The deﬂec-
tion is small in magnitude (it is proportional to the
wavelength), and, like the Berry phase, can be repre-
sented in the form of a contour integral in the k-space:
δrσl =

is determined by the rays of zero approximation (i.e. by
Eqs. (6) with ˙r = k/k). Deﬂection δrσl is non-integrable
and can grow unlimitedly with the ray length s; its maxi-
max ∼ |σ + l| s/kL,
mum value can be estimated as
where L is the characteristic scale of the medium inho-
mogeneity. Since the deﬂection δrσl is directed orthog-
onally to both the main beam propagation direction, k,
and the applied ‘external force’ ˙k ∝ ∇n (Fig. 2), the
phenomenon can be treated as intrinsic Hall eﬀect of pho-
tons, which is of a universal nature for various particles
[4].
If one separates the spin and orbital parts in an
obvious way, δrσl = δrσ + δrl, the previously known de-
ﬂection δrσ can be associated with the spin Hall eﬀect
of photons [6–9], whereas the deﬂection δrl, introduced
in the present paper, should be interpreted as the in-

4

However, there are some sharp distinctions. First, the ad-
ditional Berry phase acquired during the beam evolution
provides for the parallel transport of the intensity cross
distribution in the beam along the ray. The eﬀect can
be detected when a Hermite–Gaussian beam propagates
of along a helical trajectory or through the measurement
of rotation of the speckle-pattern when a circular multi-
mode ﬁber is twisted. Second, the ray equations describ-
ing deﬂections of beams with diﬀerent values of σ + l,
predicts thereby the intrinsic orbital angular momentum
Hall eﬀect for photons, which resembles Magnus eﬀect
for optical vortices. The eﬀect has signiﬁcant advantages
compared to the spin Hall eﬀect of photons: (i) it can be
dozen of times larger in magnitude with the respective
values of l; (ii) it is independent of the polarization and
takes place for waves of any nature. The eﬀect can be
measured through the deﬂection or splitting of singular-
ity lines for vortices with diﬀerent l.

worth noticing that though the evolution of the beam’s
center of gravity is described by the expected values, in
actual fact the total beam splits into the partial beams
propagating along slightly shifted trajectories (6). This
can be detected, as in the Hall eﬀects, through accu-
mulation of the photon states with opposite signs of σ
or l at the opposite sides of the beam, see [10,18], or
through the splitting of the singularity lines of vortices
with diﬀerent l. In this way, a Hermite–Gaussian beam
propagating in an inhomogeneous medium will split into
composing Laguerre–Gaussian beams (1) with opposite
values of l. Like the circularly rather than linearly polar-
ized plane waves are independent modes in an inhomo-
geneous medium [7,10,18], it is the Laguerre–Gaussian
beams that constitute the independent localized modes.
This follows from the diagonality of the Berry connection
(3) in the basis of beams (1).

When a superposition of beams (1) is considered, their
Berry phases introduced explicitly in Eq.
(5) can be
taken into account by means of the equation of evolution
of the state vector aplσ. Analogously to the equation of
motion for the state vector with one quantum number σ

Conclusion. We have considered propagation of a
paraxial beam carrying intrinsic spin and orbital angular
momenta in a smoothly inhomogeneous medium in the
geometrical optics approximation. It is shown that ex-
pressions for the Berry connection and curvature, as well
as the equations of motion, are similar to situation when
only SAM is presented, with a substitution σ → σ + l.

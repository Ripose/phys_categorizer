One of the fundamental limitations to high bit rate, long distance, telecommunication in optical
ﬁbers is Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD). Here we introduce a conceptually new method to
reduce PMD in optical ﬁbers by carrying out controlled rotations of polarization at predetermined
locations along the ﬁber. The distance between these controlled polarization rotations must be less
than both the beat length and the mode coupling length of the ﬁber. This method can also be
combined with the method in which the ﬁber is spun while it drawn. The incidence of imperfections
on the eﬃciency of the method is analysed.

Introduction. Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD)
arises when two orthogonal states of polarization prop-
agate at diﬀerent velocities in optical ﬁbers. PMD is
one of the fundamental limitations on high speed, high
bit rate communication in ﬁber systems because it dis-
torts the shape of light pulses, and in particular induces
pulse spreading. Hence much eﬀort has gone into reduc-
ing PMD in optical ﬁbers, see [1, 2] for reviews.

PMD arises because of uncontrolled stresses or
anisotropies induced in the ﬁber during the manufac-
turing process and during deployement. These cause
unwanted birefringence, and hence PMD. This residual
birefringence changes randomly along the ﬁber, resulting
in random mode coupling as the light propagates along
the ﬁber. Because of this statistical process, the eﬀects
of PMD -such as pulse spreading- increase as the square
root of the propagation distance[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This sta-
tistical process makes it extremely diﬃcult to correct the
eﬀects of PMD after the light has propagated through a
long length of ﬁber. For this reason one rather tries to
reduce the PMD of the ﬁber itself.

Two main methods have been devised to reduce PMD
in optical ﬁbers. The ﬁrst is to minimize asymmetries
in the index proﬁle and stress proﬁle of the ﬁber. To
this end the manufacturing process has been steadily im-
proved. The second method is to spin the ﬁber during
the manufacturing process as described in [8, 9]. Spin-
ning does not reduce the anisotropies in the ﬁber. Rather
it modiﬁes the orientation of the anisotropies along the
ﬁber in such a way that after one spin period the eﬀec-
tive birefringence and PMD is reduced. The eﬀects of
spinning on PMD were analyzed in e.g. [10, 11, 12, 13].
Residual birefringence can be characterized by the ﬁber’s
beat length, which in present day ﬁbers is of order 10m.
In the present work we introduce a conceptually diﬀer-
ent method for reducing PMD in optical ﬁbers. Our basic
idea is to introduce controlled polarization rotations at
predetermined locations along the ﬁber in such a way
that the eﬀects of PMD are reduced. This is paradox-

ical since the aim is to reduce birefringence and PMD,
and we claim to achieve this by introducing additional
polarization rotations. Our main idea is that after sev-
eral such controlled polarisation rotations, the state of
polarisation of the light has been oriented along many
diﬀerent directions on the Bloch sphere in such a way
that the eﬀects of the ﬁber birefringence averages out.
We will show that this can be a highly eﬀective method.
It can also be combined with the method of spinning the
ﬁber.

We will not be concerned here with how the controlled
polarization rotations are implemented in practice. We
note that there are many ways of inducing controlled
birefringence in ﬁbers, and hence controlled polarization
rotations. Typically these imply inducing stress in the
ﬁber, for instance through compression, twisting, etc. We
leave for future work to determine which implementation
of controlled polarization rotations is most suitable for
reducing PMD.

The method presented here for reducing PMD in op-
tical ﬁbers is inspired by the pulse sequences (e.g. spin
echo) that have been developed in Nuclear Magnetic Res-
onance (NMR) to reduce the eﬀects of imperfections, see
for instance [14]. It is also related to the ”bang-bang”
technique introduced by Viola and Lloyd to reduce de-
coherence in the context of quantum information[15, 16].
Wu and Lidar [17] suggested applying bang-bang control
to reduce losses in optical ﬁbers through controlled phase
shifts, but their proposal is impractical because the con-
trol operations need to be implemented over distances
comparable to the wavelength of light. On the other
hand in the present case the control operations need to
be implemented over distances of order 1m, which makes
reducing PMD with controlled polarisation rotations a
practical proposal. An important conceptual diﬀerence
which we stress is that in the bang-bang technique one
wishes to average to zero the coupling between the sys-
tem and the environment, whereas in the present case it
is the coupling between the polarisation and frequency

of light itself, ie.
system, which one wishes to average to zero.

Polarized light propagating in optical ﬁbers.
Consider a light pulse propagating along a birefringent
optical ﬁber. The pulse is centered on frequency Ω and
has wave number K. The distance along the ﬁber is de-
noted l. Its amplitude can be written as

A(l, t)e−iΩt+iKl

(1)

where the slowly varying envelope of the pulse A(l, t) =

A1(l, t)
A2(l, t)

is a two component vector, called the Jones

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
vector, which describes the polarisation state of the light.
We introduce the variable t′ = t
l/vg where vg is the
group velocity of the pulse, whereupon A obeys the evo-
lution equation

−

i∂lA = B0(l)A + iB1(l)∂t′ A

(2)

B0|
|

where B0 and B1 are traceless, hermitian matrices de-
scribing the birefringence and PMD along the ﬁber. (The
parts of B0 and B1 proportional to the identity are in-
corporated into the wave vector K and the average group
velocity vg. For simplicity we neglect loss, dispersion, and
non linearities.) The term proportional to B0 describes
the phase birefringence. Its magnitude is generally mea-
sured by the beat length LB = π/
which is the length
after which the polarization is brought back to its origi-
nal state. If only B0 was present in the ﬁber, the state of
polarization would evolve in an unknown way, but there
would be no pulse spreading. The PMD is encoded in the
group birefringence B1 which describes the diﬀerence in
group velocities of the two orthogonal states of polariza-
tion. This term will give rise to spreading of pulses. The
birefringence changes along the ﬁber, hence both B0(l)
and B1(l) depend on the position l along the ﬁber. In
present day low birefringence ﬁbers both LB and the dis-
tance over which B0 and B1 change are comparable and
of order 10m.

We can rewrite these matrices as

Basic Principle of the method. For simplicity we
will ﬁrst suppose in the following paragraphs that ~B(ω)
is independent of l, whereupon the Jones matrix is

U (l) = e−i ~B(ω)·~σl.

(7)

Let us now show that, even though we do not know
~B(l, ω), it is possible to compensate for the evolution
so that after compensation the polarization comes back
to its initial state. The following procedure consisting of
four basic steps that are then repeated, realises this:

1. The light propagates over distance l. The distance
l is taken short enough such that
l << 1, hence

the evolution can be well approximated by the ﬁrst-
order approximation:

i ~B~σl = 1

il(Bxσx + Byσy + Bzσz) .

2. We interrupt the evolution by ﬂipping the polariza-
tion around the x axis. We then let the light evolve
over a new distance l and ﬁnally we ﬂip again the
polarization around the x axis. The evolution in
step 2 is thus described by σxU (l)σx. To ﬁrst order

which eﬀectively compensates the evolution due to
the By and Bz components. The evolution due to
the Bx component is not yet compensated; this will
be accomplished during the next two steps.

3. The same as Step 2, but the spin is ﬂipped around
the y axis. Step 3 is thus described by σyU (l)σy.
By expanding U (l) to ﬁrst order we obtain

σyU (l)σy ≈

the z axis. Step 4 is thus described by σzU (l)σz.

Putting all together, the time evolution over the four

(9)

where we denote by lseq = 4l the length of the sequence.
The evolution is therefore eﬀectively stopped. The proce-
dure is then repeated again and again. Note that because
σyσz = iσx, eq. (8) simpliﬁes to

A(l, ω) = U (l, ω)A(0, ω)

U (lseq) = σzU (l)σxU (l)σzU (l)σxU (l) .

(10)

The method relies on the fact that the interaction, al-
though unknown to us, does not change along the ﬁber
(at least for the short lengths lseq we are considering
here). The unknown birefringence ~B that is responsi-
ble for the rotation of the polarization in the ﬁrst place
is there all the time, and aﬀects the polarization after the
x, y and z rotations, and brings it back to its initial state
at the end of the sequence.

B1.

In optical ﬁbers the phase birefringence is of the same
order as the group birefringence. This implies that
Since ω, the frequency spread of the
B0/Ω
≃
pulse,
is much smaller than Ω, the carrier frequency,
we can expand eq. (9) to ﬁrst order in ωB1 to obtain
U (lseq) = 1 + O(B2
seq) + O(ωB1B0l2
seq). Consider now
the evolution over a ﬁxed length L > lseq. It is given by
1 + O(B2
U (L) = U (lseq)L/lseq
0 lseqL)+ O(ωB1B0lseqL)
whereas in the absence of the control sequence it would
have been given by 1 + B0L + ωB1L. Hence there is a
reduction of PMD by a factor B0lseq = πlseq/LB.

Note that as shown in [16] it is possible to devise se-
quences that cancel not only the terms of order Bl, but
higher order terms as well. For instance the sequence

U (l)σxU (l) = 1 + O(B3l3

cancels the evolution up to order B3l3.

Combining Controlled Polarization Rotations
and Spun Fibers.
It is possible to reduce PMD in
optical ﬁbers by combining the methods of controlled po-
larization rotations and of spinning the ﬁber while it is
drawn. Here we ﬁrst show how to include both methods
in a uniﬁed description, and then we discuss how they
can be used in combination.

For spun ﬁbers the evolution equation is no longer

given by eq. (4), but by

3

If we incorporate controlled polarization rotations, we

get the evolution equation:

i∂lA =

U †

spin(l)B(ω)Uspin(l) + Bc(l)
(cid:17)

A

(cid:16)

(14)

where Bc(l) (proportional to Dirac delta functions) de-
scribes the controlled polarization rotations. It is conve-
nient to rewrite this equation in the frame that rotates
with the spin. To this end we deﬁne ˜A(l) = Uspin(l)A(l).
The rotated Jones vector obeys the evolution equation

(cid:16)

i∂l ˜A =

spin(l)
(cid:17)

B(ω) + ∂lα(l)σy + Uspin(l)Bc(l)U †

˜A .
(15)
Thus in the rotating frame, spin is formally identical to
a continuous controlled polarization rotation given by
∂lα(l)σy, whereas the controlled polarization rotations
Bc(l) are rotated and take the form Uspin(l)Bc(l)U †
spin(l).
Therefore even though they have completely diﬀerent ori-
gins, they can easily be combined. For instance one easily
checks that by carrying out a σx ﬂip of polarization af-
ter each spin period one cancels both linear and circular
birefringence.

Imperfections.

In the above calculations we have
supposed that the unknown polarization rotation ~B does
not change along the ﬁber. The method stays valid if
~B(l) changes slowly along the ﬁber. To see this suppose
that ~B(l) is a smooth function which can be expanded in
Taylor series

~B(l) = ~B(0) + l∂l ~B(0) + O(l2) .

(16)

We deﬁne the length over which the birefringence changes
by

B(0)
Lchge = |

∂lB(0)

.

(17)

i∂lA = U †

spin(l)B(ω)Uspin(l)A

(12)

Because B(l) is now position dependent, the evolution

eq. (7) must be replaced by

where

Uspin(l) = e−iα(l)σy

(13)

U (l)

describes the spin of the ﬁber, α(l) is the spin function
(the angle by which the ﬁber is spun), and σy is the Pauli
matrix that generate polarization rotations around the
circular polarization axis. To ﬁrst order in B the evolu-

This expression must be inserted into eq. (8). The terms

have supposed that ∂lB1/B1 ≃
that in modern ﬁbers with low birefringence the beat
length LB is comparable to the length Lchge over which
the birefringence changes. Hence the two terms in eq.

∂lB0/B0 = L−1

(19) are of comparable magnitude and there may not be
much to gain by going to a sequence such as eq. (11)
which cancels the PMD to second order

The second source of imperfections we consider is the
fact that in general the controlled polarisation rotations
will not be achromatic, and will therefore themselves in-
troduce PMD. Thus, instead of carrying out the rota-
tion σx, one carries out the rotation exp[iσxπ(1 + ωβ)/2]
where β
1/Ω. In order for the method to be
eﬀective we must cancel the PMD due to β. To do this
we propose using the idea of stacking several chromatic
waveplates to yield an essentially achromatic waveplate
[19]. For instance the following stack of 3 π rotations,
with C = 1/2 and S = √3/2, cancels all PMD to order
(ωβ)2:

B1/B0 ≃

≃

eiσx(π+ωβ)/2e−i(Cσx−Sσy)(π+ωβ)/2eiσx(π+ωβ)/2
= i(Cσx + Sσy) + O(ωβ)2 .

(19)

Thus, by replacing each controlled polarisation rotation
by three controlled polarisation rotations, one can create
achromatic sequences.

·

·

~σ)/2] = iσx(1 + i~r

A third limitation is that the controlled polarisation
rotations will diﬀer slightly from π rotations in a random
way. Thus instead of implementing σx one implements
exp[i(πσx +~r′
~σ + O(r2)) where ~r and
~r′ are small random vector (which are simply related to
each other). The main eﬀect of these errors is that the
stacks of 3 π rotations mentioned above will no longer
be perfectly achromatic. If we suppose that the random
vectors ri associated with the successive controlled polar-
isation rotation are independent, then we have to include
an error term of the form O(ωβ√Nr) where N is the to-
tal number of controlled polarisation rotations and r is
the average length of the random deviations ri.

As an illustration of the eﬀects of imperfections let us
consider the case where the residual PMD is characterised
10m. We correct for the
Lchge ≃
by length scales LB ≃
PMD using the simple sequence of polarisation rotations
eq. (10), and in order to cancel the PMD of the polari-
sation rotations themselves, we replace each rotation by
a triplet of rotations as described above. After one beat
length the Jones matrix is of order

U (LB) = 1 + O(ω0) + O(ωB1lseq) + O(βωr

LB/lseq) .

q

Assuming r = 1/30, and inserting omitted numerical con-
stants, we ﬁnd that the PMD is reduced by a factor of 5
for the optimal value of lseq = LB/7.

Conclusion. We have presented a method to reduce
PMD in optical ﬁbers based on the use of controlled po-
larisation rotations. The results presented here are only
a ﬁrst overview of the potentialities of the method, and

4

we expect that signiﬁcant improvements of the sequences
presented can be achieved by using the same methods
which are succesfully used to optimize pulse sequences in
NMR. The method presented here can be combined with
the well established method of spinning the ﬁber. The
eﬃciency of the combined method will depend on the
detailed properties of the residual birefringence in spun
ﬁbers, and on the precision with which the controlled po-
larisation rotations can be implemented. In addition to
the important application for long distance, high speed
telecommunication in optical ﬁbers, this method may
ﬁnd applications in other systems in which one wants
to reduce unwanted birefringence. Finally, on the con-
ceptual side, our work provides a simple system in which
to test the ideas of bang-bang control.

What are the left-handed media and what is
interesting about them?∗

K. Yu. Bliokh†and Yu. P. Bliokh‡

Abstract

We review the intensively discussed ideas about wave propagation and re-
fraction in media where both electric permittivity and magnetic permeability
are negative. The criticism against negative refraction as violating the causal-
ity principle is considered. Starting from the initial wave equations, refraction
of beams at the boundary of a left-handed medium is analyzed. The physics
of a perfect lens formed by a ﬂat layer of a left-handed material is considered.

1 Introduction

The term “left-handed media” was ﬁrst introduced by V. G. Veselago in 1967 [1] for
media with a negative refractive index1. The increase in the number of publications
on this subject is clearly illustrated by the table (Fig. 1) published by J. B. Pendry
in April 2003 in the introduction to a special issue of Optical Express [3]. A ﬂood
of interest in this problem at the end of the 1990s was initiated by the creation of
composite media with negative refraction and their ﬁrst experimental studies. What
is so interesting about these media that has made many physicists abandon their
current activities and turn to investigating them? The present paper is an attempt
to answer this question.

Figure 1: The number of publications on negative-index media (NIM) (from Ref. [3])

2 Negative-index media

The sign of the refractive index of a medium depends on whether the phase and
group velocities of a wave are parallel or antiparallel in this medium. In the ﬁrst
case, the group velocity is considered positive and in the second case it is considered
negative. We believe that it is worth quoting L. I. Mandel’shtam’s paper of 1945 [4]
in this connection:

“Perhaps it should be stressed that the sign of the group velocity has a consider-
able eﬀect on some phenomena that are usually discussed without even mentioning
the group velocity.

I mean, for instance, reﬂection and refraction of a plane wave at the plane bound-

ary between two nonabsorbing media.

In deriving the corresponding equations – for the direction of the refracted beam
and for the amplitudes of the reﬂected and refracted waves – one makes an assump-
tion, usually not mentioned explicitly, that the phase velocity of the refracted wave

1The concept of a negative refractive index was also ﬁrst introduced by Veselago [2]

forms an acute angle with the normal to the boundary directed towards the “second”
medium.

At the same time, according to the physical essence of the problem, this assump-
tion should relate to the group velocity (to the velocity of energy propagation). The
resulting equations are correct only because in real situations, as mentioned above,
we deal with positive group velocities.

If the group velocity is negative, the requirement that the energy propagates
from the boundary is equivalent to the requirement that the phase on the boundary
is increasing. In this case, the refracted beam is directed not in a usual way but
symmetrically with respect to the normal to the boundary.”

In the same paper, Mandel’shtam notes that a spatially periodic medium (in his
analysis, a crystal lattice) provides an example of a medium where the refractive
index can be negative within a certain frequency range. Composite left-handed
media, which were developed at the end of the nineties [5, 6] and caused an explosion
of interest in this problem, are also spatially periodic. Such media have a negative
refractive index for microwaves with frequencies of the order of 10 GHz.

Periodic waveguide systems, or slow wave structures, have been well known in
microwave electronics for a long time. Waves with negative refractive index are
also well known: these are backward waves, or negative-dispersion waves. So what
is the diﬀerence between the “old” slow wave structures and the new ones, the
left-handed media? A principal diﬀerence is that the traditional “old” slow wave
structures are one-dimensional, while the left-handed media are multi-dimensional
(two- or three-dimensional). Refraction of a wave at the interface of two media is a
multi-dimensional eﬀect and is therefore absent in slow wave structures.

Investigation of multi-dimensional periodic structures was started long ago (see
Refs. [7, 8, 9] and the references therein) but the authors of Refs. [5, 6] do not
cite any previous works. This is possibly because they are unaware of papers pub-
lished in Russian; another reason may be that their approach to the problem is
totally new. The authors of theoretical paper [5] consider the possibility of creat-
ing a periodic structure with a surface where low-frequency weakly decaying waves
could exist, similarly to plasmons – collective waves in metals. This is possible in
a medium with negative electric permittivity (dielectric constant). The authors of
Ref. [5] have shown that a periodic grating of thin wires has low losses and negative
electric permittivity ε < 0 for electromagnetic waves with frequencies of 1–10 GHz.
Later, it was shown [6] that a periodic grating of ring cavities has negative magnetic
permeability µ < 0 in the same range. By combining both gratings, a left-handed
negative-index medium was formed [10, 11].

It should be said to the credit of Western scientists that they managed to make
their research a tremendous success due to publications in respected physics journals

3

as well as in popular publications, including newspapers2. But we now put the
questions of prestige aside and turn to physics.

As another example [12] of a left-handed medium, we mention photonic crystals,

which are media with a spatially periodic refractive index n(r).

Thus, left-handed media are two- or three-dimensional periodic structures. In
such anisotropic media, the angle between the phase and group velocities of a wave
can be diﬀerent. The only exceptions are spatially periodic media that are isotropic3
in the long-wave approximation, when the wavelength λ is much larger than the
d. In this case, a medium can be characterized by eﬀective electric
period d, λ
permittivity ε and eﬀective magnetic permeability µ, and waves can be classiﬁed as
forward and backward. It was shown in Ref. [12] that in photonic crystals, where
modulation of parameters is rather strong, anisotropy in some frequency ranges near
bandgaps can be negligibly small.

3 Wave propagation and refraction in left-handed

media

We consider a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in a medium with a scalar
electric permittivity ε and a magnetic permeability µ. If ε > 0 and µ > 0, the electric
ﬁeld ~E, magnetic ﬁeld ~H, and wavevector ~k form a right-handed vector triplet; if
ε < 0 and µ < 0, they form a left-handed triplet. This is the origin of classifying
media into left-handed and right-handed [1]. The energy ﬂux of a wave is given by
the Poynting vector

~S =

~E ~H

,

c
4π

h
which always forms a right-handed triplet with the vectors ~E and ~H. Therefore,
the group and phase velocities are parallel in right-handed media (positive group
velocity) and are anti-parallel in left-handed media (negative group velocity).

i

Refraction of a plane wave at the interface of a left-handed medium and a right-
handed one looks quite unusual. For deﬁniteness, we consider a wave propagating
from a usual right-handed medium (which is assumed to be the vacuum in what
follows) to the plane boundary of a left-handed medium. The group velocity of
the refracted wave is directed from the boundary and its phase velocity is directed

3While we were preparing this material for publication, a paper appeared [13] where refraction of
light at the interface of two anisotropic media with diﬀerent directions of optic axes was erroneously

towards the boundary. This means that the phase velocities of both waves are
directed towards the boundary, and hence the phases of both waves increase on the
boundary. This is possible only if the propagation directions of both waves (group
velocities) are on the same side of the normal to the boundary (Fig. 2). In other
words, the refractive index n entering Snell’s law for the left-handed medium is
negative, n =

√εµ.

Figure 2: Refraction of a plane wave.

The fact that the incident and refracted waves are on the same side of the normal
to the boundary enables one to manufacture quite unusual optic elements of left-
handed media. For instance, a plane-parallel plate made of a left- handed material
works as a collecting lens, as can be readily seen from the ray diagram in Fig. 3.
it has no focal plane. It therefore forms a
Such a lens has a remarkable feature:
three-dimensional image of an object, which makes it similar to a mirror. But in
contrast to a mirror, it forms a real image, and this feature opens new possibilities for
three-dimensional photography. Of course, this ﬂat lens also has a certain drawback:
for an object to be imaged, it must be placed suﬃciently close to the surface of the
lens. For instance, for an object placed near a lens made of a “perfect” left-handed
material (ε = µ =
1), only those points whose distance from the lens surface does
not exceed the thickness of the lens have real images (Fig. 4).

−

It is no accident that we have used the term “perfect left-handed medium” for the
medium with ε = µ =
1. Indeed, such a medium has some additional interesting
features. First, a perfect left-handed medium has zero reﬂection coeﬃcient: all the
energy of the incident wave is passed to the refracted wave. Second, a plane-parallel
plate of a perfect left-handed material forms a perfect image because the phase
incursion along any trajectory between the object and the image equals zero. This

can be easily understood by noting that for any beam traveling from the object to
the image, half of the path is in the ordinary medium and the other half is in the
perfect left-handed medium. Because phase velocities in the two media have equal
values but opposite directions, phase delays along the two parts of any trajectory
exactly compensate each other.

But these are not all the wonderful properties of a perfect left-handed medium.
In 2000, Pendry published a paper “Negative refraction makes a perfect lens” [15].
Here, “a perfect lens” means a lens whose resolving power exceeds the limit set by
the wave nature of light. In order to understand the author’s reasoning, we consider
a monochromatic light source placed in the plane parallel to a plate of a perfect
left-handed material. Let the distribution of the ﬁeld (magnetic ﬁeld, for instance)

as a spatial Fourier transform,

It can be seen from representation (2) that the Fourier components with k⊥ >
ω/c decay exponentially with the distance from the source. These nonpropagating
waves are usually neglected. Omitting harmonics with k⊥ > ω/c means losing the
information about the details of the image that are smaller than the wavelength
λ = 2πc/ω.

In Ref. [15], it is noted that the exponential decay of nonpropagating waves
aﬀects only their amplitudes but not their phases. Therefore, one can completely
restore the information about the spatial structure of the source by amplifying these
waves. It is shown in Ref. [15] that a plate of a perfect left-handed material can
serve as this “perfect” ampliﬁer, increasing the amplitudes of nonpropagating waves
by exactly the same value as that of their decay.

These unusual (and quite tempting from the practical standpoint) properties
of left-handed materials have caused an outburst of publications during the recent
years. However, not all the participants in the discussion in the literature agree with
the optimistic conclusions that we have brieﬂy reviewed in this section.

4 Negative refraction and the causality principle

In 2002, Physical Review Letters published a paper entitled “Wave refraction in
negative-index media: always positive and very inhomogeneous” [16]. The authors
claim that negative refraction contradicts the causality principle and therefore does
not exist. The authors’ reasoning can be most easily understood with the help of
Fig. 5.

Let a wave packet be incident on an interface of the vacuum (left) and a left-
handed isotropic medium (right). The group velocity ~v(1)
and the phase velocity
~v(1)
ph of the wave packet in the vacuum coincide. Let the wave packet front coincide

g

Figure 5: Negative refraction and the causality principle.

g

with the line AA1 at time t1 and with the line BB1 at time t2 > t1. In the left-
handed medium, the phase velocity of the refracted wave ~v(2)
ph is directed towards
the boundary. According to the authors’ reasoning, if the group velocity ~v(2)
of
the refracted wave were directed oppositely to the phase velocity, then the front
of the refracted wave packet would be oriented along the line AC (dashed line in
Fig. 5), orthogonally to the group velocity direction. Because the time required for
AC is the same for all points
the front displacement along the path AA1 →
of the front, it follows from Fig. 5 that the signal should travel along the path A2BC
with inﬁnite velocity. This violates the causality principle. The authors conclude
that the front of the refracted wave should coincide with the bold line BC1 and the
group velocity should be orthogonal to it. They suggest that one should distinguish
between phase and group refractive indices. The ﬁrst describes the change in the
direction of the phase velocity, and it is indeed negative for left-handed media.
But the group refractive index describes the direction of energy propagation, and
it is positive. Because the beam diagram used in geometric optics (like the one
shown in Fig. 3) should indicate the direction of energy propagation and not phase
propagation, there can be no focusing properties of the plate, to say nothing of
forming a “perfect” image.

BB1 →

Further, a large diﬀerence between the group and phase velocities of the refracted
wave means strong dispersion; therefore, a wave packet “spreads” after passing the
interface of the two media, its amplitude decreases very fast, and decay of the
incident wave occurs instead of focusing.

The standpoint of the authors of Ref. [16] is described in full detail, with pictures

and animations, at http://www.utexas.edu/research/cemd/nim/.

5 Wave and geometric optics of a left-handed me-

dium

Two ﬂaws can be seen in the above proof that the “actual” (i.e., group) refraction
cannot be negative. First, the authors claim that group and phase velocities can be
noncollinear in an isotropic medium. Second, to investigate the focusing properties
of an optical system (in our case, a plane-parallel plate) one does not need to consider
a multi-frequency wave packet, hence, dispersion of the medium is not relevant.

In order to ﬁnd the source of error in Ref. [16], we consider refraction of a
narrow monochromatic light beam in the framework of the wave equation. First of
all, this approach enables us to do without the concept of group velocity direction
as the direction of energy propagation. (Indeed, the beam direction is evidently
the same as the direction of energy propagation.) Second, using the wave equation
approach allows ﬁnding whether the geometric optics approximation is applicable
to left-handed media.

Let the incident wave be the exact solution of the two-dimensional Maxwell

equations in the vacuum. It can be represented as the Fourier integral

and therefore the refraction law is the same for the phase and group velocities.

Thus, by exactly solving the Maxwell equations, we see that there is no diﬀerence
between phase and group refractive indices and that the refractive index is negative
for a left-handed medium.

We next consider the contradiction between the exact solution of the Maxwell
equations and the statement in Ref. [16] that “causality and ﬁnite signal speed pre-
clude negative refraction for any waves incident on any material, including NIM”
(negative-index medium). We return to the scheme of wave packet refraction shown
in Fig. 6; this time, however, negative refraction is assumed. Figure 7 shows the
positions of the wave packet at three consecutive time instants, t1 < t2 < t3, which
allows reconstructing the shape of the packet in the medium. Indeed, the front of the
refracted packet coincides with the line BC1 shown in Fig. 5, but the statement in
Ref. [16] that the normal to the front gives the group velocity direction is erroneous.
Hence, the conclusion that the phase and group velocities in a left-handed medium
are noncollinear is also erroneous. Actually, when the packet crosses the boundary
of a left-handed medium, its shape changes: an initially “straight” packet becomes

12

Figure 7: Transformation of a wave packet at the boundary of a left-handed medium.

a “slanting” one. (In Ref. [17], such behavior was called “crab-like motion”.) Cer-
tainly, there is no causality violation here.

We had two reasons to choose the test solution of the Maxwell equations in
the form of a narrow wave beam in this section. First, it allowed us to resolve
the paradox in Ref. [16] without using the notion of group velocity; second, this
way we could formally demonstrate that geometric optics (the concept of beams) is
applicable to left-handed media. Actually, we never used the inequality k0a
1;
≫
therefore, the solutions we obtained are also valid for describing other situations.

We ﬁnally note that after paper [16] had been published, a number of papers
appeared where the authors, by means of analytic [17, 18] or numerical [19, 20]
methods, came to the same conclusion as the one we make in this section. However,
in all those papers, nonmonochromatic waves were considered. In our opinion, this
is not necessary for solving the present problem and can make the wrong impression
that the methods of traditional optics, where nonmonochromaticity is considered
only as a source of chromatic aberrations, cannot be applied to left-handed media.

6 A perfect lens

In analyzing equation (7), we have already considered the imaging of a source inside
a left-handed medium in the simplest case of ε = µ =
1 and a ﬂat source placed
parallel to the boundary of the medium. The same relation (7) can be used in a more
general case where the source has arbitrary orientation relative to the boundary. We
express k′

⊥ through k⊥ and write Eq.(7) in the form

Relation (10) means that the source and its image are placed symmetrically with
respect to the boundary. Similarly, one can obtain relations in a more general case
of a medium with arbitrary ε and µ. Without presenting these relations, we only
mention that the source ﬁeld can be exactly restored only in the case of a perfect left-
handed medium. In all other cases, the image has imperfections. Monochromatic
aberrations can be avoided if the lens is made of an anisotropic left-handed material
with specially chosen dispersion dependence [21], but we do not consider anisotropic
media in the framework of this paper. The properties of anisotropic left-handed
media are considered in detail in Ref. [9].

We recall that the accuracy of restoring the image inside a plane layer of a
perfect left-handed medium is limited by the wavelength, as in usual optical systems.
But this is true only in the case where the left-handed medium does not amplify
nonpropagating waves with k⊥ > k0. At ﬁrst sight, the statement in Ref. [15] that
a layer of a left-handed medium ampliﬁes nonpropagating waves and hence enables
one to exceed the wave limit for the accuracy of image restoration looks erroneous
because a left-handed medium is a passive medium. But we refrain from hasty
conclusions and try to scrutinize the problem. Because the problem is linear, we

We start again from the problem of a plane wave incident on an interface of
a right-handed medium and a left-handed one. Let the magnetic ﬁeld Hy of the
incident wave be H (in0) exp (ikzz), the plane z = zl being the interface of the media.
The magnetic ﬁelds of the transmitted and reﬂected waves occurring at the

∼

interface are represented, respectively, as

ikzz) (z < zl),

We note the denominators in Eqs. (12).

If both the incident wave and the
transmitted wave are propagating ones, then the denominators are nonvanishing at
any values of k⊥, because sgn ε = sgn qz. But if either the incident wave or the
transmitted wave is a nonpropagating one, for which k2

Equation (14) is the dispersion equation of surface eigenmodes, which can exist on
the interface of a right-handed medium and a left-handed one in the absence of a
source ﬁeld H (in0) [22].

q

If the wavevector k⊥ of the source ﬁeld coincides with the solution to dispersion
equation (14), then the amplitudes of the transmitted and the reﬂected waves be-
come inﬁnite, because the external ﬁeld acts as a resonant force exciting nondecaying
eigenmodes of the medium. Hence, the interface itself is a resonant “ampliﬁer” of
nondecaying waves. Similarly to the case of a usual cavity, taking nonzero losses in
the medium into account restricts the amplitude of the resonant surface wave and
determines the resonance linewidth.

Before passing to the plane-parallel lens, we note an interesting feature of surface
waves: their energy ﬂux is directed along the surface and changes sign on the surface.

(13)

(14)

15

In the case of a perfect left-handed medium, the ﬂuxes on the right and on the left
of the surface have equal absolute values, and therefore the total energy ﬂux along
the surface is equal to zero.

We now consider a plane wave incident on a plane-parallel plate of a left-handed
material. Let the second boundary of the plane coincide with the plane z = zr. In
addition to the previously considered waves, two new waves appear now: the one
reﬂected from the second boundary and the one passing through the plate. Their
magnetic ﬁelds are denoted by

H (ref 2) exp (

iqzz), H (tr2) exp (ikzz),

respectively. From the boundary conditions on the two surfaces, taking all waves
into account, we express their amplitudes as

The zeroes of the function D(k⊥), whenever they exist, indicate the existence of
nondecaying eigenmodes of the ﬁeld in the plate. It is clear that D(k⊥) has no zeroes
if the wavevector kz is real. This is why we saw no ampliﬁcation in the preceding
sections, where we only considered propagating waves.

For an arbitrary sign of ε, the equation D(k⊥) = 0 always has a solution if qz
is real and kz is imaginary. These are the eigenmodes of a transparent plate placed
into a nontransparent medium without dissipation. The nonpropagating ﬁeld of the
source is “ampliﬁed” near the values of resonant wavevectors k(n)
⊥ corresponding to
the eigenmodes of the plate.

But the most interesting result is obtained when both kz and qz, are imaginary.

In this case, the D(k⊥) can be written as [23]

It follows from (19) that the ﬁeld of the Fourier harmonic in the plane z = 2d
is close to unity, i.e., to its value in the source plane z = 0, if the wavevector k⊥ is
in the “resonance” domain k0 < k⊥ < k(res)
⊥ . At the same time, it is exponentially
small in the domain k⊥ > k(res)
(see Fig. 8)5. We see that in the plane z = 2d, the
amplitudes and phases of the source ﬁeld are the same as in the plane of the source,
not only for propagating Fourier harmonics, but also for nonpropagating ones. In
other words, both propagating and nonpropagating Fourier harmonics participate in
the image formation. The size of the smallest details resolved in the image is given
by the value 2π/k(res)
⊥ , which can be much smaller than the wavelength λ = 2π/k0.

5When this paper was in preparation, Ref. [24] appeared where the dependence shown in Fig. 8
was obtained from a numerical solution to the Maxwell equations. Because the case of a dissipative
medium was considered in Ref. [24], the dependence there had a narrow maximum at k⊥ = k(res)
instead of a divergence, as in Fig. 8

It follows from Eqn. (20) that for a given increase in the resolving power k(res)

For instance, for k(res)

⊥ /k0 = 3 and d = λ = 2π/k0 (this is the case for the
dependence in Fig. 8), δ should be smaller than 10−7. Therefore, although a source
can formally be imaged with any given precision, in practice only a small resolution
increase is possible for a source placed at a small distance (z
λ) from the surface
of a thin lens (d
λ). Such a combination of the object, lens, and image placed at
a distance of the order of the wavelength or smaller should be considered not as a
lens but rather as a complex source of radiation in a layered medium [25].

We make one more remark. For the cavity formed by the plate of a left-handed
material to amplify the weak “input signal” (the nonpropagating wave from the

18

source), this cavity should accumulate a large energy, which requires a long transient
process. The larger the resolution that the lens is required to produce, the smaller
the “input” level of the corresponding nonpropagating modes, and the larger the
level of the ﬁeld in the cavity and the time of the transient process. Most probably,
ignoring this fact prevented the authors of Ref. [20] from observing the eﬀect of
a “perfect” lens when they performed numerical simulation of a time-limited wave
packet propagating through a plane-parallel plate of a left-handed material.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we tried to give a review of left-handed media and some interesting
eﬀects related to them. Certainly, we could not mention most of the papers con-
nected with this subject (see Fig. 1) but we hope to have mentioned the basic ones.
Although the stream of papers is still huge (in 2003, several dozen papers have been
published), the peak of the excitement has gone. In 1999 – 2002, almost every new
statement was soon followed by arguments disproving it, but the present discussion
is more productive. Now, very few researchers doubt the existence of left-handed
media. Left-handed media have been realized in various ways by many experimen-
talists, and these works conﬁrm both the unusual refraction law at the interface of
two media and the focusing properties of a plane-parallel plate. The situation is
somewhat worse with the perfect lens eﬀect, because observation of this eﬀect is
possible only under very strict requirements to the parameters of the left-handed
medium.

In this work, we did not touch upon subjects such as nonlinear optical eﬀects
at the interface of right-handed and left-handed media, one-dimensional periodic
waveguide media containing left-handed elements, etc. All these ques- tions are
related to the further development of this direction, while our aim was only to
acquaint the reader with the basic principles of the physics of left-handed media.

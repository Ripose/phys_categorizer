The one-dimensional holographic display

Kim Young-Cheol

This paper introduces a new concept of one-dimensional hologram which
represents one line image, and a new kind of display structure using it. This
one-dimensional hologram is similar to a superpositioned diﬀraction lattice.
And the interference patterns can be eﬃciently computed with a simple
optical computing structure. This is a Proposal for a new kind of display
method.

Introduction

This paper intends to introduce a new display method using the holography theory by Dennis
Gabor in 1948. The holography had been expected to be a popular display method for a 3-
dimensional image, but the burden of tremendous amount of data processing prohibited the
practical application. Thus, I would like to introduce a one-dimensional holographic display
concept which can reduce the burden of data processing, can adopt simple optical computing
method, and has some more practical merits in manufacturing. A one-dimensional hologram
can display only a two-dimensional image, but it does not require the lenses like HMD(Head
Mount Display). Instead, this one-dimensional holographic display device has a possibility of
showing a real-time two-dimensional information without a lens, within today’s technology.
This paper contains theoretical considerations about the one-dimensional Holography, and
the equations that I derived showing the existence of the one-dimensional hologram as well
as discussions about practical structures of the display device, the light modulators, and the
optical computing device.

This work had started by considering the information dimension of a hologram. A tra-
ditional two-dimensional hologram can display a three dimensional image, So I speculated
that this 2 to 3 relationship between data dimension and image dimension could be trans-
formed into 1 to 2 relationship. So, I ﬁrst tried to ﬁnd a one-dimensional hologram for a
two-dimensional image by geometrical method, but failed. Instead, I found that a diﬀraction
lattice like one-dimensional hologram is formed by some special condition of line image. And,
I had conceived a vector and matrix based mathematical technique which can easily express
the idea. Unexpectedly, this technique was also useful to handle the problem of diﬀraction
eﬃciency and noise cancelling problem for computed artiﬁcial two-dimensional hologram.

2. The Hologram

A phasor expression for a wave from one point source is Eq. (1).

Let A(~r) represent the relative phase and the amplitude of a wave function, then

A(~r) = α(~r) exp (i[f (~r) + δ])

(1)

≫

(α(~r) = √the detection probability of wave quanta , f (~r) = 2πr/λ ) The α is indeed a
complex function, but when r
λ, it is a simple function proportional to 1/r, and it
is actually a constant when computing a one-dimensional hologram mainly discussed in
this paper. The traditional wave function Ψ is obtained by considering the time term.
Ψ(~r, t) = A(~r) exp(2πiωt) The above phasor expression does not represent a real wave,
but the interference pattern of a certain point depends on only relative phase diﬀerences be-
tween light rays, so the time term disappears when computing the interference pattern. The
coherent rays have constant relative phases. The polarization of lights are ignored. A phasor
expression for waves from many point sources is Eq. (2) by the principle of superposition.

Let S(~r) be superpositioned A(~r) of Eq.(1), then

S(~r) = X α(~r) exp (i[f (~r) + δ])

An actual hologram is a record of the interference pattern on a photographic plate. The
interference pattern depends on the illumination.

Let I(~r) be the illumination over the space then,

I(~r) =

This can be rewritten as

I(~r) = X α(~r) exp (i[f (~r) + δ])

× X α(~r) exp (

−

i[f (~r) + δ])

And, when expanded to a matrix, it is

Take this matrix’s diagonals to the ﬁrst term, remaining ﬁrst column to the second term,
remaining ﬁrst row to the third term, and others are added to their symmetry conjugated
and deﬁned by cosine function, then the result is

J(~r) = exp (if1(~r))(1 + X α2)

The ﬁrst term is 0th order term, the second term represents image, the third term represents
conjugate image, and the fourth term is noise term. The above method does not depend on
any particular coordinate system, so it can explain volume hologram, as well.

3. The One-dimensional Hologram

When considering the dimensions of storing and displaying hologram, the volume hologram
can display three-dimensional image, and can be multiplexed with wavelengths and spatial
coordinates of light sources. The two-dimensional hologram can display three-dimensional
image, and can not be multiplexed. When considering one-dimensional hologram, one-
dimensional hologram can display one-dimensional image(one-line image), and can not be
multiplexed.

In Cartesian coordinate system, when r

λ, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as

A(~r) = A(X, Y, Z)

formation on a XY plain can be obtained by substitution Z = 0. The thickness of zero can
not exist in real world, so an actual two-dimensional hologram by photographic method is a
thin volume hologram and in fact, it is signiﬁcantly advantageous to reduce image noise.

If Y is substituted with zero again, it could be called as a one-dimensional hologram.
But, it is a hologram on a physical line. It is hard to ﬁnd physical meaning. Instead, if a
hologram on a plain is expressed with single axes information, then it also can be called as
the one-dimensional hologram.

The phase of Eq. (8) is relative to the source of light. It is possible to transform the
expression to be relative to the origin (X, Y, Z) = (0, 0, 0) of coordinate system. When the
light is parallel, the r of Eq. (1) is inﬁnite, r0 is the distance between the origin and source.

on x axes only. Therefore, Eq. (11) represents a one-dimensional hologram in this paper.

shall be displayed. And, the whole plain image is displayed by updating the one-dimensional

light synchronously and in sequence. The natural color is obtained by repeating display with
the three primary colors.

The incident angle of reproducing light should be adjustable, so a deﬂection device is
needed. There may be many kind of deﬂection device, but the one-dimensional hologram
itself also can be used as a deﬂector. In fact, the one-dimensional hologram deﬂector is
identical to a cosine diﬀraction lattice.

The deﬂecting plate 1, 2 and the one-dimensional hologram are cross structured light
modulators. One of the deﬂecting plate 1 or 2 operates at a time and the other maintains
the transparent state. The incident angle of parallel ray in ﬁgure 1 is ﬁxed as in ﬁgure 2,
then one of the deﬂectors 1 and 2 deﬂects the parallel ray by deﬂection range 1 or 2 in
ﬁgure 2. This structure makes it possible to eliminate the 0th order light by total internal

reﬂection. It is considerable to replace one of the one-dimensional hologram deﬂectors with
a multiplexed volume hologram.

Theoretically, it is possible to display a two-dimensional image with above scheme, but
there are some more considerable problems to actually develop and operate this display
device. They are developing optical modulation device, noise cancelling of image, and the
fast computation of the interference pattern. And, the comparison with conventional two-

7

dimensional hologram method or with controllable diﬀraction lattice method is needed to
verify the usefulness of the one-dimensional hologram display method.

4.A. The light modulating device

A hologram display device requires very high resolution spatial light modulator than con-
ventional display device. Recently, it had been announced that liquid crystal display device
has reached the resolution of 10µm. However, this resolution is still not enough to display a
hologram.

The hologram method display device has no relation between the image resolution and the
resolution of optical modulation device. The resolution of modulator is related to the ﬁeld of
view, precisely, it is related to the angle between a light from a picture element of an image
and the reference light of hologram. When α1 = 1, Eq. (11) can be rewritten as,

be λ/4 to display a image without the limitation of visual ﬁeld. To express natural color, if
about 400nm of blue ray wavelength is substituted for λ, then a modulator of approximately
100nm resolution is required. When using previously mentioned liquid crystal display device

been continuous researches for other types of optical modulation devices. As one of them,
according to recently opened Japan NTT Docomo’s patent document2, they have mentioned
that higher than 1µm resolution may be obtained by using a photo-refractive crystal. This is
capable of displaying about 20cm wide screen at 1m distance, but still it is not fully enough.
The 1µm resolution mentioned above is the possible resolution for the two-dimensional
hologram. The resolution of modulator can be improved by using one-dimensional hologram.
To display a two-dimensional hologram, one pixel electrodes should be placed for each pixel,

wires, all these elements should be placed on a transparent plate with a matrix form. Figure
3 is a light modulation device structure for hologram display suggested by NTT Docomo.

Fig. 3. NTT Docomo’s light modulator.

To display a one-dimensional hologram, all the structures mentioned above may not be
placed on the displaying transparent plate, except the pixel electrodes. Displaying the ﬁgure
4 clearly doesn’t need the matrix of ﬁgure 3.

Only the pixel electrodes are needed to be placed for display and all other elements may
be placed at the edge of each electrode. This will improve the display resolution almost to
the limit of wiring technology. It seems that the recent 60nm wiring technique is enough for
the goal of 100nm resolution.

4.B. The noise eliminating in hologram calculation

A practical display device needs to consider about the problem of image quality. The image
quality is determined by resolution of image, luminosity and noise. The resolution problem
shall not be discussed, because the holography is intrinsically high resolution display, regard-
less of the modulator’s resolution. And, the luminosity problems may be solved by multiple
modulating of phase modulation method. Then the noise remains.

The 4th term of Eq. (7) and term

of Eq. (12) are the noise terms. These noises are
caused from the assumption that light modulation happens instantly at a surface. When
reproducing light is illuminated to hologram of Eq. (11), the energy distribution E of all
modulated lights by hologram without normalization is

When the number of image elements is n and assuming that all image elements have identical
luminosity for convenience, the Eq. (14) can be rewritten as E = 1 + nα2 + nα2 + n2α4. The

10

ﬁrst term is the 0th order term except diagonals, the second term is the total luminosity of
image, third term is the total luminosity of conjugate image and fourth term is sum of 0th
order diagonals and noise term. when α
0 with same n the total luminosity of image is
suﬃciently less than reference light, the energy of noise term becomes negligible than the
energy of image. This shows that the noise term is especially important for the computer
generated hologram on a plain, and negligible when a volume hologram is used. But, noise
can be eliminated by simply throwing the noise term and using row 1 and column 1 of Eq.
(5), except diagonals. That is, instead of the expression of Eq. (3)

So, it is expressed with cosine function.

The negative value becomes possible, so, it needs diﬀerent way for normalization. This one-

4.C. Fast hologram computing

One of the most big problem in hologram display device is its tremendous data process-
ing burden. When displaying 3-D image with a hologram, there is no other way except
improving the algorithm, but when displaying 2-D image, it is possible to compute only
partial area of modulator, and can reuse its data on whole area to improve the speed of
computing. When using one-dimensional holography, this situation becomes better. For two-
dimensional hologram, all the hologram pixels (column H(ologram) pixels
row H pixels)
must be computed by all the image pixels(column I(mage) pixels
row I pixels). But, For
one-dimensional, just one column of the hologram pixels(column H pixels) are computed by
one column of the image pixels(column I pixels), and repeats this for number of the row line
of image(row I pixels). This increases computing speed by

The aperture size of human eyes1 are between 2mm to 8mm. So, for clean visuality, let the
size of partial hologram to be 2mm, and let the hologram resolution to be 100nm, then the
one-dimensional hologram may be computed 20,000 times faster than the 2-D displaying
two-dimensional hologram. But, current digital calculator may not be able to handle the
required computing burden for real time color motion picture display.

Fortunately, there is other solution for one-dimensional hologram calculation. It is possible
to make adjustable one-dimensional interference pattern then read it with photo-sensor array.
A coherent light started from a source is modulated and diﬀused by light modulation
device with input signal, this light is modulated into multiple parallel rays by lens, and gain
hologram output data by reading interference patterns from those parallel rays with photo-
sensor array. This is shown on ﬁgure 5. In this case, the calculation speed depends on the

used, so, small values of α should be used. In order to do so, A multi-layered one-dimensional
hologram may be used. The light modulation eﬃciency should be lowered at each hologram,
and the modulation is repeated with multiple layer.

the structure of ﬁgure 5 can be applied to all latitude lines regardless of ˆr
reducing ˆr

be changed to more paraxial, and at the same time, it makes the size of the photosensor
array larger. The method in ﬁgure 5 can be formed in a thin shape with tens thousand pixel
lineal CCD in one-dimensional holography, but when applied to two-dimensional hologram,
it would encounter the problems of embodying in a thick shape, illuminating the reference
light very out of ranged from radical axis, and making hundreds million pixel CCD.

4.D. The comparison with diﬀraction lattice

As mentioned above, a one-dimensional hologram can be regarded as a multiplexed diﬀraction
lattice, too. So, the comparison of one-dimensional and diﬀraction lattice is considerable.

When examining the calculation speed of diﬀraction lattice to display an image, for a
diﬀraction lattice, each column of the lattice line pixel ( column L pixels) should be computed
by each pixels of the image, and this should be repeated for the number of the row lines
of image ( row I pixels), then repeated again for the number of the column lines of image (
column I pixels). This amount of calculation equals to that of the one-dimensional hologram.
Considering the computing speed, diﬀraction lattice is not bad, but there are other prob-
lems in diﬀraction lattice method. The light modulator for displaying the diﬀraction lattice
should be changed for each image pixels. When one line image of one-dimensional hologram
consists of 2000 pixels, the modulator for diﬀraction lattice should be reconﬁgured 2000
times more than one-dimensional hologram. This means that the light modulator and all
the elements of ﬁgure 5 should have 2000 times faster speed than those of one-dimensional
hologram.

To compare the data transfer rate, let us assume that light modulator consists of 1mm

1mm parts by 100nm resolution, the displaying image consists of 2000
2000 pixels, and let
us choose the frame rate of 48 frames per a second(24 is traditional frame rate, but a hologram
or a lattice can express only one color at a time, thus some extra frames are needed. It seems
that 72 monochrome frames are not required for 24 color frames, when 6 frames are used
for three times of shape refreshing, and two times of color refreshing, 48 frames are enough.
48 is chosen because it is about 50 that is easy to handle.), then the time limit for a frame

of two-dimensional hologram is about 1s/50 = 20ms, for a line frame of one-dimensional
hologram is about 1s/50/2000 = 10µs, and for a dot frame of the diﬀraction lattice is
1s/50/2000/2000 = 5ns.(A 2000
2000 pixel image is quite high resolution for plain pictures,
but it is only not so bad resolution for eyeglasses type display devices of wide visual angle.)
And, with 1mm/100nm = 10000, the transfer rates are calculated as 10000
10000/20ms = 5
giga times per a second for two-dimensional hologram, 10000/10µs = 1 giga times for one-
dimensional hologram, and 10000/5ns = 2 tera times for diﬀraction lattice. These results
show that the one-dimensional holography is most eﬃcient.

Some other ways of using diﬀraction lattice exist they avoid calculation and transmis-
sion of data. A material which self arranges its fringe by voltage has been known, and the
method of using acoustic wave as the diﬀraction lattice also has been known. But, the ar-
rangement speeds of these methods seem diﬃcult to meet 5ns of time limit, because the state
of molecules in that kind of material should be determined by their neighbour molecules, and
the informations are exchanged with the speed of acoustic wave. The acoustic wave method
may be considerable for one-dimensional holography, if it is capable of expressing 100nm
resolution.

5. Conclusion

The one-dimensional holography is a new display method which has balanced characteristics
between conventional two-dimensional holography and diﬀraction lattice method. This is a
theoretical method yet, and thus it seems that there are no precedent and few references. But,
this is not a unique theory, this is an application of common theory for a special problem,
thus, this could be theoretically veriﬁed easily.

Many researcher’s dedications are required for practical use of one-dimensional holography.
Especially, the research for a fast responsive light modulating material seems essential. As
modulating method, phase modulating or polarization modulating material may be adequate.
Also, more precise design of optical calculator is required. Other computing methods like
analog computing device or faster DSP could be researched. And, many others may also be
needed.

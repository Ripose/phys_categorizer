Electron interferometry with nano-gratings

(Dated: January 24, 2014)

We present an electron interferometer based on near-ﬁeld diﬀraction from two nanostructure
gratings. Lau fringes are observed with an imaging detector, and revivals in the fringe visibility occur
as the separation between gratings is increased from 0 to 3 mm. This veriﬁes that electron beams
diﬀracted by nanostructures remain coherent after propagating farther than the Talbot length zT =
2d2/λ = 1.2 mm, and hence is a proof of principle for the function of a Talbot-Lau interferometer
for electrons. Distorted fringes due to a phase object demonstrates an application for this new type
of electron interferometer.

Near-ﬁeld interference eﬀects that result in self-similar
images of a periodic structure were noticed by Talbot in
1836, and later described as Fourier images [1, 2, 3]. One
remarkable feature is that revivals in image visibility oc-
cur periodically as the plane of observation is separated
from the periodic structure. The visibility of self-images
is maximized at half-integer multiples of the Talbot dis-
tance zT = 2d2/λ, with d being the period of the struc-
ture and λ the wavelength of the light or de Broglie waves
illuminating the structure. Partially coherent waves are
required to observe self-images of a single grating (the
Talbot eﬀect). However, a related phenomenon (the Lau
eﬀect) occurs with incoherent light if two gratings are
used [3, 4, 5]. Fringes are then formed behind the second
grating, and the fringe visibility oscillates as a function
of grating separation. These Lau fringes have maximum
visibility on a distant screen when the gratings are sepa-
rated by nd2/λ, with n being an integer. In a Talbot-Lau
interferometer, Lau fringes are detected with the aid of
a third grating, but the fringes can also be observed di-
rectly on a screen, thus making a Lau interferometer as
shown in Figure 1.

Here we present a Lau interferometer for electrons
based on two nanostructure gratings that each have a
period of d = 100 nm. With medium energy (5 keV)
electrons that have a de Broglie wavelength of λ = 17
pm, the Talbot length is 1.16 mm. An imaging detec-
tor 80 cm beyond the gratings was used to observe the
Lau fringes shown in Figure 2, and the fringe visibility
as a function of grating separation is plotted in Figure 3.
If the fringes are analyzed with a third grating (even a
digital grating in the image processing can achieve this
purpose), then this apparatus serves as a Talbot-Lau in-
terferometer. However, even more information is gained
by studying images of the Lau fringes directly.

Interferometers based on the Talbot and Lau eﬀects
have found applications in light optics [3, 5, 6], in atom
optics [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], and more recently with x-rays [12].
Yet even though electron interferometry is a mature ﬁeld
[13, 14, 15], neither Lau nor Talbot-Lau interferometer
designs have been operated with electrons until now.

Perhaps the chief reason that Talbot-Lau interferom-
eters have not previously been created for electrons is
that suitable periodic structures have not been available.
Crystals with a lattice period on the order of 1 nm can

serve as a grating, but the resulting Talbot length of 200
nm is too short for many practical interferometer exper-
iments [16]. A further complication is that the angular
misalignment of the two gratings must be smaller than
one grating period over the height of the beam. Hence
alignment within 10−6 radians is required when using
crystal gratings and a 1 mm high beam. These limita-
tions are overcome by using nanostructure gratings with
a 100 nm period. Then the talbot length is increased
to 1 mm, and the alignment tolerance is relaxed to 10−3
radians.

Nanostructures for electron optics are new. The grat-
ings that we use are fabricated at MIT [17], and were
only recently used to study electron diﬀraction [18, 19].
Similar gratings have enabled several atom interferome-
ters [9, 10, 20, 21], and thicker gratings have given ﬁrst
light to x-ray Talbot interferometers [12]. That nano-
structures can be used for coherent electron optics was
not obvious for several reasons. Local charging of the
nano-structures, non-uniform image charge interactions
with the nano-structures, and the possibility of coulomb
drag and electron energy loss due to passing within a
few nanometers of a surface are just a few mechanisms
that could lead to decoherence. Our results show that
suﬃcient coherence is maintained to operate an electron
interferometer with nanostructure gratings.

In the rest of this paper we describe the electron op-
tics setup, and the diﬀraction theory used to study the
revivals in Figure 3. We comment on the role of im-
age charge interactions between electrons and the nano-
gratings. Then we demonstrate an application of this
interferometer: the study of the index of refraction for
electrons due ﬁelds around a charged needle tip.

The Lau fringes have highest visibility when the grat-
ing separation (z0) and the distance to the screen (z)
satisfy

where d is the period of the gratings. Equations 1 and
2 are derived in the Fresnel approximation in references
[3, 6, 11]. Because the distance to the screen is typi-
cally 800 times as long as the separation between gratings
(z/z0 = 800) in our experiment, the fringes are eﬀectively
magniﬁed so that d′ = 800d. The ratio of periods for G1,
G2 and the detected fringes is therefore 1:1:800.

To describe

shape and visibility,
V ≡ (max − min)/(max + min), of the fringes as a func-
tion of grating separation we relied on a calculation given
in Equation 3 of reference [11]. Brieﬂy, the concept is
that the ﬁrst grating is considered to be a set of mutu-
ally incoherent point sources of monochromatic waves.
Waves from each point source are diﬀracted by G2 and
arrive at the imaging screen in the near-ﬁeld (Fresnel)
diﬀraction regime. The intensity pattern on the screen is
generated by adding diﬀraction patterns from each point
source. Grating G1 and the screen deﬁne the position
of many sources and detectors; they function as classical
components. In contrast, grating G2 acts as a quantum
mechanical diﬀraction object. This theory was used to
generate the curves in Figure 3 and the theoretical por-
tion of Figure 4.

We are justiﬁed in considering incoherent illumination
of G1 by the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, which gives

FIG. 3: Revivals in fringe visibility as a function of grat-
ing separation (z0). Data (symbols) are compared to theory
(line) from reference [11] for two gratings each with 35% open
fraction. Visibility maxima are found when the gratings are
separated by a half integer number of Talbot lengths, and
this depends on the electron accelerating voltage (Vacc). The
maximum visibility is 30% for both the 3keV and 5keV elec-
trons. Visibility decays when the fringe period is comparable
to the resolution of the detector.

the transverse coherence length, ℓtcoh ≈ λ/θ in terms of
θ, the angle subtended by the source. The electron beam
is focused to a 10 µm spot just 2 cm in front of G1 (see
ﬁgure 1) and the spot size in this plane cannot be made
smaller because of the extended electron source and lens
abberations. This corresponds to a coherence length of
ℓtcoh = 10 nm, which is smaller than the grating period
of d = 100 nm.

As remarked in reference [11], the essential coherent
eﬀect is diﬀraction at the second grating. The ﬁrst grat-
ing simply serves as an array of sources, and the fringes
could be detected by a transmission mask (with a pe-
riod d′) and an integrating detector. One virtue of using
an imaging detector, with a digital sampling density of
100 pixels per mm, is that we can study fringes of vary-
ing period (d′) as the grating separation (z0) is changed.
Images also reveal the fractional Talbot eﬀect by show-
ing fringes of half the period compared to that given by
Equation 2, when the grating separation is three quarters
of the Talbot length, z0 = 3/4zT . The fractional Talbot
eﬀect was also observed with z0 = 1/4zT .

Our experimental data are best ﬁt by a grating trans-
mission function for G1 and G2 that is described by a
35% open fraction, and a weak image-charge interaction
between electrons and the grating bars.
Image-charge
interactions were discussed in detail in [18, 19], and the
have a similar eﬀect on the electron optics as the Casimir-
Polder interaction does for atom optics [11, 22, 23]. We
include the strength of the image-charge and the phys-

FIG. 4: Lau fringes vs. grating separation. Each row in this
composite image represents a row from a diﬀerent raw image.
The raw images were taken with diﬀerent values of G1-G2 sep-
aration (z0). The theoretical composite was generated with
the theory given in reference [11]. A point spread function for
the imaging detector (Gaussian with rms = 40 µm), and the
open fraction of the gratings (35%) is included in the theory.

ical size of the grating windows as two free parameters
in the transmission function for the second grating. The
best ﬁt image charge for 3 keV electrons is q′ = 0.03|e|,
and the best ﬁt image charge for 5 keV electrons is only
q′ = 0.01|e|. This suggests that the electron-surface in-
teraction at the nanometer scale depends on the velocity
of electrons with respect to the surface. More research
to investigate this is under way.

Additional analysis of the shape of the fringes was ac-
complished by taking the Fourier transform of images
such as Figure 2. These image transforms show how the
spatial frequency of the fringes change with grating sep-
aration. A composite image of fringe spectra, in which
each column represents the spatial frequency spectrum
of fringes for a speciﬁc grating separation (z0), is shown
in Figure 5. The fractional Talbot eﬀect is clear at the
grating separation z0 = 0.85 mm. The higher harmon-
ics of spatial frequency indicate that the fringes are not
purely sinusoidal, but tend in places to look more like
the binary (Ronchi rule) masks made by ideal absorbing
nanostructure gratings. This is the self-imaging property
of the Talbot and Lau eﬀects.

To demonstrate that this interferometer can be used
to study phase shifts for electrons due to various objects,
we inserted a charged wire in the beam after the second
grating in plane P of Figure 1. Like a lightening rod, the
tip of the wire causes large gradients in electric poten-
tial. The electric potential in the space around the wire
changes the index of refraction for electron waves and
distorts the interference fringes as shown in Figure 6.

sensitive only to gradients in phase, not phase di-
rectly. This design is known as a shearing interferom-
eter and shifts in fringe position are proportional to
[∂/∂x]Φ(x, y) and distortion in the fringes is associated
with [∂/∂x]2Φ(x, y), where Φ(x, y) =
n(x, y, z)k0dz,
with n(x, y, z) being the index of refraction [3, 5, 6, 12,
13, 14, 15]. For electron de Broglie waves this is Φ(x, y) =

trons, m the electron mass, e the magnitude of the elec-

Because phase gradients are caused by energy gradi-
ents, i.e. forces, the sensitivity demonstrated here is not
diﬀerent in principle from a deﬂection sensor that can
study classical forces on electrons. However, the virtue
of the interferometer is still apparent because the fringes
make it easier to detect deﬂections. One advantage is
that the fringe period is 10 times ﬁner than the smallest
focus that could be produced with the incoherent beam
and abberations of the lens system in this apparatus. Sec-
ond, the fringes are formed simultaneously over a large
spatial region without scanning the beam.

A continuous wire produces a uniform linear phase gra-
dient (∇Φ(x, y)) with opposite sign on either side of the
wire. That is how it serves as a bi-prism [15]. Around the
tip of the freely suspended charged wire, however, there is
a strong double gradient term (∇2Φ(x, y)). Hence fringe
distortion is expected around the tip of the charged wire,
and uniform fringe shifts are expected along the sides of
the charged wire. Since the shifts are perpendicular to
the wire, and in general the wire can be skew to the grat-
ing bars, fringes on either side of the wire can appear out
of step as indicated in ﬁgure 6. This serves as a proof
of principle that the interferometer setup presented here
can be used to study diﬀerential phase shifts due to a
phase object.

At the time of writing of this manuscript, we are aware
of the construction of a Mach-Zehnder electron interfer-
ometer in the group of H. Batelaan, which requires a
much higher degree of electron spatial coherence than our
interferometer. Our results are distinct in that we use an
incoherent electron beam and we image electron interfer-

ence fringes directly. The imaging tool allows us to detect
fringes with arbitrary period (d′), and thus permitted us
to study quantitatively the revivals in fringe visibility as
a function of grating separation. Imaging also enabled

us to observe the fractional Talbot eﬀect with electrons
and nanostructures. The most useful result of using an
imaging detector is the ability to study fringe distortions
due to phase objects in the electron interferometer.

In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel electron in-
terferometer that uses two nanostructure gratings and
near-ﬁeld interference eﬀects. We demonstrated the Lau
eﬀect for electrons and observed revivals in fringe vis-
ibility when the gratings are separated by multiples of
the Talbot length. This type of electron interferometer
does not require spatially coherent electron waves from
the electron gun, but still it tests how well the nanostruc-
tures generate and preserve coherence for electron waves.
The eﬀect of image-charge interactions between electrons
and the grating structure was observed, but it does not
inhibit the electron interference. The apparatus is a rudi-
mentary sheering interferometer, and serves to demon-
strate diﬀerential phase shifts. We have thus shown that
metal-coated silicon nitride nanostructure gratings can
be used as elements for coherent electron optics.

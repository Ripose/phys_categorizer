(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Photonic crystal (PC) coupled cavity waveguides (CCWs) with completely separated eigenfre-
quencies (or supermodes) are investigated. Using a coupled mode theory, the properties of the
supermodes, such as the electric ﬁeld proﬁles, the eigenfrequencies (including the central frequencies
and corresponding linewidths), and the quality factors (Qs) are expressed in very simple formulas,
and these results agree well with those of “exact” numerical method. We also discuss the great
diﬀerences between the supermodes and continuous modes, which are described by tight binding
(TB) theory. Then, the properties of supermodes are used to investigate their potential applications
in multichannel (covering the whole C-band) bistable switchings, and bistable loops are obtained
numerically. We also predict and verify that all the thresholds are uniform inherently.

Photonic crystal (PC) [1, 2] coupled cavity waveguides
(CCWs) [3, 4], which are formed by series of coupled
point defects in otherwise perfect PCs, have been inves-
tigated intensively using tight binding (TB) theory in
the last several years [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and the propaga-
tion mechanism of hopping between neighboring cavities
has been clearly understood [10]. Generally speaking, a
periodic CCW possesses a continuous transmission band
of Ω0(1
), where Ω0 is the
|
eigenfrequency of an individual cavity and κ, ∆α are
two related overlap integrals [3, 4]. For convenience, the
modes of the continuous band derived from TB theory
are called TB-modes in this paper. Many potential ap-
plications, such as broadband dropping [11], broadband
splitting [12, 13], broadband optical switching and limit-
ing [14, 15], and ultrashort pulse transmission [16] are all
based on the continuous transmission bands (TB-modes).
In practice, however, the number of the cavity N is
ﬁnite, and Born-von Karman periodic condition is used
[5, 9] and N discrete modes are obtained, which satisfy
the dispersion relation of [5, 9]:

Where R is the distance between two neighboring cav-
ities, and L is the total length of the system. When
the coupling strength between the cavities are designed
carefully, and some criteria are satisﬁed[17], a quasi-ﬂat
spectrum with N small dips formed by the N discrete
modes may be obtained[17]. Actually, the broadband
operations mentioned above [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] are all
realized using the quasi-ﬂat transmission band.

On the other hand, one can also design a N -cavity
CCW to make the N modes separated completely[17],

FIG. 1: One dimensional photonic crystal CCW structure
considered in this paper. The individual cavity of C is repre-
sented by C = ¯ababcbab¯a. Where a, b and c are three diﬀer-
ent kinds of medium layers with refractive indexes of na, nb
and nc, and physical thicknesses of λ0/(4na), λ0/(4nb) and
λ0/(2nc), respectively. The layer ¯a is the same as layer a
except that the thickness is a/2. λ0 is a reference wavelength.

(these separated modes are called supermodes in this pa-
per and the reasons are given below), rather than to
form a quasi-ﬂat band. We ﬁnd that the predictions
of TB theory become inexact (as shown below) in this
case. Although the supermodes of a N -cavity system
have been noticed early[17], the properties of them are
not investigated intensively (such as the mode proﬁles
and linewidths of each supermodes), which prevents them
from wide application.

According to the criterion developed in Ref. [17], one
dimensional (1D) CCW with discrete supermodes is de-
signed, as shown in Fig. 1. Although some numeri-
cal methods, such as the ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain
method (FDTD) [18], transfer matrix [19, 20] can be used
to extract the properties we expected, we prefer to un-
derstand them from the viewpoint of physics and express
them in analysis and simple formulas.

In this paper, a general coupled mode theory is pre-
sented to analysis the supermodes of N -cavity CCW sys-
tems, as shown in Fig. 1. The eigenfrequencies, includ-
ing both the central frequencies and the corresponding
linewidths (and also the quality factors), as well as the

mode proﬁles of the supermodes are obtained, and agree
well with “exact” numerical results (obtained using stan-
dard transfer matrix method). Subsequently, these prop-
erties of supermodes are used directly to design a poten-
tial application of multichannel bistable switchings in the
whole C-band. Using the results of coupled mode theory,
we prove that the thresholds of the multichannel switch-
ings are low and uniform when Kerr media are carefully
introduced into the cavities.

COUPLED MODE THEORY ANALYSIS OF
SUPERMODES

In the coupled mode theory presented in this paper, the
electric ﬁeld Eω(r) of the entire coupled cavity system is
expressed as a linear superposition of the modes of the
N cavities:

N

Eω(r) =

AnEΩ(r

· · ·

n=1

where An (n = 1,
, N ) are complex coeﬃcients that
determine the relative phase and amplitude of the cav-
ities. Eω and EΩ(r
nRez) are the ﬁelds of the entire
coupled system and those of individual cavities centered
at nRez respectively. ez is the direction of the cavities
being aligned. ω and Ω are the allowed frequency of the
coupled system (is unknown now) and the frequency of
an individual cavity (is already known). We normalize
EΩ(r) to be unity according to
E(r) = 1,
with ǫ0(r) the dielectric function of an individual cavity.
Eq. (2) is very similar to the linear superposition ﬁeld
used in TB theory, which reads [3, 4]:

the same modulars of

determined. However, in Eq.(2), the coeﬃcients of An
are arbitrary complexes, and the amplitudes and phases
of them may be greatly diﬀerent for various of n. This
is one of the most important diﬀerences between super-
modes and TB-modes.

Eq. (5) is very similar to the governing equations of
coupled waveguide arrays [21], or phase-locked injection
laser arrays [22, 23, 24], where, the solutions are called
supermodes of the waveguide (or laser) arrays. Similarly,
we name the solutions of Eq.(5) as the supermodes of
the CCW. Generally, Eq. (5) can not be solved in closed
form, however, it can be simpliﬁed and solved for some
very special cases. For example, when only the nearest
neighboring coupling are considered and the cavities are
uniformly spaced. Then the coeﬃcients are simpliﬁed to

Then, using the same method as used in Ref.[21, 22,
23, 24] and proper boundary conditions, one obtain the
solutions of the Eq. (5). Generally, there’re N solutions
(supermodes) for a N -cavity CCW system. For the Lth

(5) and Eq.

Eq.

(15) are the main results of the
coupled mode theory discussed above. We want to
point out that in Eq. (12), CL tends to inﬁnite when
θL = mπ + π/2 (m is an integer). For example, when
N = 5 and L = 3. However, this does not mean that the
coupled mode theory is invalid in this case. Because the
parameter of CL is a function of frequency of the super-
mode, α and β (see Eq. (6)), but not an physical quality.
The values of physical qualities of AL
n (Eq.(11)) and ωL
(Eq. (15)) are both ﬁnite and correct when compared
with numerical results.

Actually, the method shown above is not new, and it
has been considered in Ref.
[4] for the special cases of
N = 2 and 3. When N = 2, one can derive from Eq. (13)
that C1,2 =

results of Eq. (2) in Ref.
[4]. Similarly, one also can
calculate the frequencies and ﬁelds for the case of N = 3,
which are also the same as the results in Ref. [4]. (In Eq.
(3) of Ref. [4], the ∆α is regarded as negligible small).

±

In order to show the power of the coupled mode the-
ory discussed above, we consider a one dimensional CCW
with a large number of cavities (i.e., N = 16), as shown
in Fig. 1. Using the standard transfer matrix method
(TMM) [19], one can easily obtain the transmission spec-
trum, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Using Eq. (15), (12) and
(13), one also can calculate the 16 eigenfrequencies, and
the results are shown in Fig. 2(b). Clearly, the theoret-
ical results agree well with the numerical results. Here,
the parameters are set to be α = 0.00499, β =
0.01497
and ∆α = 0, which are obtained according to the follow-
ing two steps: Firstly, we numerically obtain the two
eigenfrequencies of (ω1,2/Ω0) = 0.990017, 1.009983 for
the case of N = 2. Secondly using Eq. (16), we calcu-
late the above parameters of α, β. Here we assumed that
∆α is negligible compared to α and β. On the contrary,
when the values of α, β, ∆α and km are substituted into
Eq. (1), much larger errors of ω(km) from the numerical
results are found. Therefore, the coupled mode theory
gives more exact results than the TB theory in the case
of discrete supermodes.

The quality factors (Q’s) of the supermodes can also
be derived from the results of coupled mode analysis.
The Q’s of the Lth supermode is deﬁned as QL =
ωLW L/∆W L, where W L = 1
D is the total en-
2
·
ergy stored in the coupled cavity system of the Lth super-
mode, and ∆W L =
dW L/dt is the energy dissipated.
According to the normalization condition of Eq. (14), one
can easily ﬁnd that the total energy of all the N super-
modes are the same, i.e, W L = W0. For the CCWs com-
posed of lossless media, the dissipation of energy of the N
supermodes are all due to the coupling out of the system
through the 1st and N th cavities. Therefore, the energy
dissipation of ∆W L is proportional to the energy stored
in the ﬁrst and last cavities, i.e., ∆W L = ∆W0 sin2(θL).
Here, we have used the results of Eq. (11). Then, one
can ﬁnd the quality factor QL of the Lth supermode:

QL = ωL W L

∆W L = ωL

W0
∆W0 sin2(θL) ≈

Q0
sin2(θL)

(17)

Here, Q0 = Ω0W0/∆W , and we have used the the fact
of ωL
Ω0. The results of Eq. (17) have been shown in
Fig. 2(c) with the parameter Q0 = 2.6347

104.

≈

On the other hand, we can also derive the QL by ﬁnd-
ing the values of QL = ωL/∆ωL
f whm from the numerical
results (Fig. 2(a)), where ∆ωL
f whm is the full width at
half maximum of the Lth supermodes. The results are
also shown in Fig. 2(c), and they agree well with the
results of Eq. (17).

×

Fig. 3 shows the ﬁeld proﬁles of the ﬁrst half super-
modes of ω1,··· ,8. For the case of clarity, the modes of
ω9,··· ,16, which are very similar to the modes of ω8,7,··· ,1
respectively, are not shown. Clearly, the results of cou-
pled mode theory of Eq. (13) are agree well with those
of the transfer matrix method. The amplitudes of indi-
vidual cavities of the Lth supermodes lie on an envelope
function of sin( xLπ
N +1 ). Therefore, the amplitude of some
cavity modes may be tend to zero, while others reach to
maxima. In the TB model, however, the amplitude of all
the cavity modes are the same.

From the discussion above, one can ﬁnd that the cou-
pled mode theory presented above describes the main
characteristics of the supermodes very well, provided that
the parameters of α, β and Q0 are given. The super-
mode states of a CCW are very diﬀerent with the states
of TB-modes, which are described by the tight binding
theory[3, 4]. For the TB-modes, the transmission band
is determined by Eq. (1), while in the supermodes, the
central frequencies are determined by Eq. (15). In the
TB modes, the localizations in each cavities are the same,
while in the supermodes, the localizations change greatly
according to a simple sine function. In the next section,
one of the possible applications of supermodes of multi-
channel bistable switchings is proposed and analyzed us-
ing the results of coupled mode theory given above.

MULTI-CHANNEL BISTABLE SWITCHINGS
WITH UNIFORM THRESHOLDS

One of the potential applications of the supermodes is
multichannel optical bistable (OB) switching, which is a
key component in all optical information systems. The
OB switching have been widely investigated in photonic
crystals with Kerr defects [14, 25, 26, 27, 28], of which
the refractive index changes with local light intensity.
i.e., n = n0 + n2I with n0 the linear refractive, n2 the
nonlinear Kerr coeﬃcient and I the local light intensity.
However, most of the researches are focused on a single
frequency operation [25, 26, 27]. In a wavelength divi-
sion multiplexer (WDM) system, there’re always need a
multi-channel switching for all the working channels. We
ﬁnd that the supermodes of CCWs are very suitable for
this function [28]. As an example, we investigate the
systems of 16-cavity CCW structures shown in Fig. 1.

According to the OB switching theory, the shift of the
eigenfrequencies with the changes of the dielectric con-
stants of the cavities is a key factor for OB operation.
Using the perturbation theory [29], one can ﬁnd the shifts
of eigenfrequencies of supermodes with the change of di-
electric constant ∆ǫ(r):

cies are proportional to their FWHMs respectively, i.e.,

cies ωL

central frequencies according to ωL
f whm, the
thresholds of the multi-channel bistable switching are ex-
pected to be uniform.

Using the nonlinear transfer matrix method [30], and
setting y = 2, we obtain the bistable switching loops, and
the results are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4 we have used
the normalized intensity of n2I [14]. We can see that the
thresholds of the switchings are almost the same. Except
for the 1st and 16th channel (In practice, the 1st and
N th channels may be tuned slightly in order to switch
them with approximately the same thresholds as other
10−6
channels), the maximum of the thresholds is 4.8
(the channel of ω15
10−6 (the
channel of ω8
in), and the relative diﬀerence is about 6%.
When the thicknesses of a, b layers are 193.8nm and
387.5nm respectively, the central frequency of λ0 is at
about 1.55µm, and the multi-channel frequencies cover
the C-band of optical ﬁber communication entirely. For
10−13cm2/W (a
a Kerr nonlinear coeﬃcient of n2 = 2
value achievable in many nearly instantaneous nonlinear
10−6W/cm2,
materials), the thresholds are about 4.6
which is much smaller than those of the switchings stud-
ied before [14, 25].

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have analyzed the supermodes of
CCW systems, which are diﬀerent from the TB-modes
and are also important operation states of CCWs. Using
the coupled mode theory, the eigenfrequencies, including
the centers and the FWHMs, quality factors, and mode
proﬁles of the supermodes are formulated in very simple
forms. And they agree well with exact numerical results.
We also discussed the great diﬀerence of the supermodes
with the quasiﬂat TB-modes. We investigated one of
the potential applications of the supermodes, which is
a 16-channel bistable switching with uniform thresholds
covering the C-band of optical ﬁber communication. The
results show that the thresholds are low and uniform.

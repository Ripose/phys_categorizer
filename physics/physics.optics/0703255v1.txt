We have measured the spectral correlations and intensity statistics of random lasing modes in
weakly scattering systems, and compared them to those of the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission
spikes. Their dramatic diﬀerences revealed the distinct physical mechanisms. We ﬁnd that local
excitation of a weakly scattering system may greatly reduce the number of lasing modes even without
absorption outside the pumped region. The lasing modes can be very diﬀerent from the quasimodes
of the passive system due to selective ampliﬁcation of the feedback from the scatterers within the
local gain region.

Random laser has attracted much interest over the past
few years. One important subject is the nature of ran-
dom lasing modes, which was not fully understood. For
random systems in or close to the localization regime,
the lasing modes are the quasimodes of the passive sys-
tem [1, 2]. The mode formation rely on the interfer-
ence of scattered waves which return to the same co-
herence volume via diﬀerent closed paths. Thus scatter-
ing provides coherent and resonant feedback for lasing,
leading to the selection of lasing frequencies [3]. Sur-
prisingly, random lasing with resonant feedback was also
realized in diﬀusive or even ballistic systems, despite the
coherent interference eﬀect was expected to be negligi-
bly small [4, 5, 6, 7]. Although the lasing modes were
assumed to be the quasimodes with small decay rates
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12], recent theoretical studies suggested
that the quasimodes of a passive random system may
not be the genuine normal modes of the same system
with gain [13, 14]. Experimentally local pumping is nec-
essary to observe discrete lasing peaks, which is hard to
explain if the lasing modes were the quasimodes spatially
extended across the entire system. Although they could
be the anomalously localized modes [9], the lasing modes
are not as rare as expected. Our latest model of the
absorption-induced conﬁnement of lasing modes in the
pumped region [15] does not apply when the absorption
outside the pumped region is negligible.

In addition to the lasing peaks, sharp random spikes
were observed in the single-shot spectra of ampliﬁed
spontaneous emission (ASE) from colloidal solutions over
a wide range of scattering strength [16]. The spikes
were stochastic and varied from shot to shot. They were
attributed to single spontaneous emission events which
happened to take long open paths inside the amplify-
ing random medium and picked up large gain. Thus
the emergence of ASE spikes did not rely on resonant
feedback or coherent interference. However, a clear dis-
tinction between the stochastic ASE spikes and coherent
random laser modes is still missing.

In this Letter, we present a systematic experimental
study to illustrate the diﬀerence between the ASE spikes
and lasing peaks. While the ASE spikes can appear in
the absence of scattering, the lasing peaks require the co-
herent feedback provided by scattering. The ensemble-
averaged spectral correlation functions for the ASE spikes
and lasing peaks, as well as the statistical distributions
of their spectral spacing and intensity, are shown to be
very diﬀerent. Such diﬀerences underline their distinct
physical mechanisms. We ﬁnd that local pumping of a
weakly scattering system may greatly reduce the num-
ber of lasing modes even without absorption outside the
pumped region. This increases the frequency spacing of
lasing modes and facilitates the observation of discrete
peaks in spectrum. The lasing modes, though still ex-
tended across the entire system, can diﬀer dramatically
from the quasimodes due to selective ampliﬁcation of the
feedback from the scatterers within the local gain region.
Our experiments were performed on the diethylene gly-
col solutions of stilbene 420 dye and TiO2 particles (mean
radius = 200nm). The experimental setup was the same
as that in Ref.
[8]. The stilbene 420 was intentionally
chosen for the weak reabsorption of emitted light outside
the pumped region. The absorption length la at the cen-
ter emission wavelength λe = 427nm was 6cm at the dye
concentration M = 8.5mM. It was much larger than the
dimension (∼ 1cm) of the cuvette that held the solution.
At the particle density ρ = 3 × 109cm−3, the scattering
mean free path ls ≃ 1.3mm at the pump wavelength λp
= 355nm, and ls ≃ 1.0mm at λe. Although la ≃ 10µm
at λp, the pump light penetrated much deeper than la
due to the saturation of absorption by intense pumping.
The excitation volume had a cone shape of length a few
hundred micron and base diameter 30µm. Because the
cone length was smaller than ls, the excitation cone in
the colloidal solution was almost identical to that in the
neat dye solution. For the emitted light, the transport
was diﬀusive in the colloidal solution whose dimension
was much larger than ls. Light ampliﬁcation, however,

occurred only in a sub-mean-free-path region. The mo-
tion of particles in the solution provided diﬀerent random
conﬁguration for each pump pulse, which facilitated the
ensemble measurement under identical conditions.

The single-shot emission spectra from the colloidal so-
lution are shown in Figs. 1(a)-(c) with increasing pump
pulse energy Ep. At Ep = 0.05µJ [Fig. 1(a)], the spec-
trum exhibited sharp spikes on top of a broad ASE band.
From shot to shot the spikes changed completely. The
typical linewidth of the spikes was about 0.07nm. The
neighboring spikes often overlap partially. As pumping
increased, the spikes grew in intensity. When Ep ex-
ceeded a threshold, a diﬀerent type of peaks emerged in
the emission spectrum [Fig. 1(b)]. They grew much more
rapidly with pumping than the spikes, and dominated
the emission spectrum at Ep = 0.13µJ [Fig. 1(c)]. The
peaks, with the typical width of 0.13nm, were notably
broader than the spikes. Unlike the spikes, the spectral
spacing of adjacent peaks was more or less regular. We
repeated the experiment with solutions of diﬀerent ρ as
well as the neat dye solution of the same M . The peaks
could only be observed with particles in the solution,
while the spikes appeared also in the spectrum of emis-
sion from the neat dye solution [Fig. 1(d) - (f)]. Although
they were similar at Ep = 0.05µJ, the emission spectra
with and without particles were dramatically diﬀerent at
Ep = 0.13µJ. Even under intense pumping, the emission
spectrum of the neat dye solution had only spikes but
no peaks [Fig. 1(f)]. The maximum spike intensity was
about 50 times lower than the maximum peak intensity
in the colloidal solution at the same pumping [Fig. 1(c)].
While the pump threshold for the appearance of peaks
depended on ρ, the threshold for the emergence of spikes

in solutions with low ρ was similar to that with ρ = 0.

In our previous experimental and numerical studies [7],
we concluded that the large peaks represented the lasing
modes formed by distributed feedback in the colloidal so-
lution. Although the feedback was weak at low ρ, the in-
tense pumping strongly ampliﬁed the backscattered light
and greatly enhanced the feedback. In contrast, the feed-
back from the particles was not necessary for the spikes
which also existed in the neat dye solution. Thus the
spikes were attributed to the ampliﬁed spontaneous emis-
sion.

To demonstrate quantitatively the diﬀerences between
the ASE spikes and lasing peaks, we investigated their
spectral correlations and intensity statistics. Since it was
diﬃcult to obtain reliable statistical data for the ASE
spikes from the colloidal solution at high pumping due to
the presence of dominant lasing peaks, the data of ASE
spikes were taken from the neat dye solution instead. We
checked that at low pumping where the lasing peaks had
not appeared, the statistical data for ASE spikes collected
from the colloidal solution with low ρ were similar to
those from the neat dye solution. The ensemble-averaged
spectral correlation function C(∆λ) was obtained from
200 single-shot emission spectra acquired under identical
condition. We chose the wavelength range 425-431 nm,
within which the gain coeﬃcient did not change much, to
compute C(∆λ) = hI(λ)I(λ+∆λ)i/hI(λ)ihI(λ+∆λ)i−1.
At low pumping [Figs. 1(a) & (d)] C(∆λ) for the neat
dye solution was very similar to that for the colloidal
solution with low ρ, while at high pumping [Figs. 1(c)
& (f)] C(∆λ) became signiﬁcantly diﬀerent as shown in
Figure 2(a). C(∆λ = 0), which was equal to the inten-
sity variance, had a much larger value for the colloidal
solution than for the neat dye solution. This result re-
ﬂected the intensity ratio of the lasing peaks to the back-
ground emission was much higher than that of the ASE
spikes. Moreover, C(∆λ) for the colloidal solution ex-

hibited regular oscillations with the period ∼ 0.27nm.
Due to slight variation of lasing peak spacing, the oscil-
lation was damped and the correlation peaks were broad-
ened with increasing ∆λ. Nevertheless, the oscillation of
C(∆λ) survived the ensemble average despite the lasing
peaks changed from shot to shot. This result conﬁrmed
not only the lasing peaks in a single-shot spectrum were
more or less regularly spaced, but also the average peak
spacing was nearly the same for diﬀerent shots. In con-
trast, C(∆λ) for the neat dye solution was smooth and
decayed quickly to 0 as ∆λ increased from 0 [inset of Fig.
2(a)]. The ASE spikes produced irregular oscillations in
the spectral correlation function of a single shot emis-
sion spectrum. However, such oscillations were removed
after average over many shots. This result reﬂected the
stochastic nature of the ASE spikes.

We also obtained the statistical distribution P (δλ) of
wavelength spacing δλ of the ASE spikes and that of the
lasing peaks. Fig. 2(b) represented P (δλ) extracted from
the same data as Fig. 2(a). Due to the ﬁnite width of
spikes/peaks, we could not get P (δλ) at δλ close to 0.
P (δλ) for the ASE spikes could be ﬁtted approximately
by an exponential decay. It suggested the ASE spikes sat-
isﬁed the Poisson statistics, which meant the frequencies
of individual ASE spikes were uncorrelated. Instead of
an exponential decay, P (δλ) for the lasing peaks reached
the maximum at δλ ≃ 0.25nm. This result reﬂected
the spectral repulsion of lasing modes. Such repulsion
could not be explained simply by mode competition for
gain [17], because the average mode spacing depended on
the length of excitation cone. Although the particle sus-
pension was in the diﬀusive regime, P (δλ) for the lasing
modes did not ﬁt the Wigner-Dyson distribution [18].

Further diﬀerence between the ASE spikes and lasing
peaks was revealed in the statistical distributions of the
intensities (I) of lasing peaks and ASE spikes. The log-
linear plot in Fig. 3(a) clearly showed that P (I/hIi) for
the ASE spikes had an exponential tail at large I. The

3

tail became more extended as Ep increased. The solid
and dotted curves in Fig. 3(a) represented the expo-
nential ﬁtting P (I/hIi) ∼ exp(−aI/hIi) at large I for
Ep = 0.13µJ (cross) and 0.39µJ (triangle) with a = 5.7
and 4.0, respectively. The log-log plot in Fig. 3(b) re-
vealed that P (I/hIi) for the lasing peaks had a power-law
decay at large I, P (I/hIi) ∼ (I/hIi)−b. The ﬁtting of
the data at Ep = 0.09µJ (open circle) and 0.13µJ (solid
square) gave b = 3.0 and 2.3, respectively. Hence, the
power-law decay became slower with increasing pump-
ing.

The above experimental results demonstrated the fun-
damental diﬀerence between the ASE spikes and lasing
peaks. Next we presented a qualitative explanation for
some of the data. The stochastic structures of the pulsed
ASE spectra of neat dye solutions were observed long ago
[19]. In our experimental conﬁguration, the ASE spikes
originated from the photons spontaneously emitted by
the stilbene molecules near the end of the excitation cone
at the beginning of the pump pulse. As they propagated
along the cone, these photons experienced the largest am-
pliﬁcation due to their longest path length inside the gain
volume. The ASE at the frequencies of these photons was
the strongest, leading to the spikes in the emission spec-
trum. Although the spontaneous emission time was a few
nanosecond, the 25ps pump pulse created the transient
gain and only the initial part of the spontaneous emission
pulse was strongly ampliﬁed. Thus the ASE pulse was a
few tens of picosecond long, followed by a spontaneous
emission tail. The spectral width of the ASE spikes was
determined by the ASE pulse duration. We extracted the
average width of ASE spikes from C(δλ) in Fig. 2(a).
After taking into account the spectral resolution of our
spectrometer, we estimated the ASE pulse duration to
be 10-100 ps, in agreement with the pumping duration.
Since diﬀerent ASE spikes originated from diﬀerent spon-
taneous emission events which were independent of each
other, their frequencies were uncorrelated. It led to the
Poisson statistics of the frequency spacing of neighbor-
ing ASE spikes. Although the occurrence of ASE spikes
did not rely on scattering, multiple scattering could elon-
gate the path lengths of spontaneously emitted photons
inside the gain volume and increase the amplitudes of
some spikes. In our experiment the size of gain volume
is less than ls, the eﬀect of scattering on the ASE spikes
was negligibly small, thus the ASE spikes exhibited little
dependence on the particle density.

To interpret the data for the lasing peaks, we must
understand how the lasing modes were formed with local
pumping and negligible reabsorption. We calculated the
quasimodes of 1D random systems and the lasing modes
under global or local pumping using a method described
in Ref.[20]. This method was valid for linear gain up
to the lasing threshold, with both gain saturation and
mode competition for gain being neglected. Thus the
number of lasing modes Nl we calculated represented the

maximum number of lasing modes that a random system
could possibly have. If optical gain existed only in part of
a weakly scattering system and there was no absorption
elsewhere, Nl was less than the number of quasimodes
of the passive system. This was very diﬀerent from the
case of uniform gain where the lasing modes had one-
to-one correspondence with the quasimodes. Moreover,
local pumping made the spatial proﬁle of a lasing mode
very diﬀerent from that of the quasimode. Although the
lasing mode was still extended across the entire random
system, the relative weight of its intensity distribution
in the part far from the gain region was reduced. Such
diﬀerences could be understood as follows. Because the
feedback from the scatterers within the pumped region
was selectively ampliﬁed, its contribution to the lasing
mode formation was greatly enhanced. Meanwhile, the
feedback from the scatterers outside the pumped region
was not ampliﬁed, and its contribution to lasing became
relatively weak.

The aforementioned calculation results provided qual-
itative explanation for the experimental data. Tight fo-
cusing of the pump light greatly reduced the number of
potential lasing modes Nl. The increase of mode spac-
ing facilitated the observation of discrete lasing peaks.
Since the reduction of Nl was a result of local ampliﬁ-
cation, it did not rely on the reabsorption of emission
outside the pumped region. The decrease of Nl with the
size of local gain region agreed qualitatively with the ex-
perimental observation of wider lasing peak spacing for
shorter excitation cone (with larger M ). Since the reab-
sorption outside the pumped region was extremely weak,
the feedback from the particles in the unpumped part of
the solution was not negligible. Hence, the lasing modes
were not equal to the quasimodes of the reduced system
deﬁned by the gain volume. Our numerical calculation
also showed that the frequency spacing of adjacent las-
ing modes under local pumping became more regular as
the scattering strength decreased. Such regularity was
intrinsic and not caused by mode competition for gain.
Because of the dramatic diﬀerence between the lasing
modes and the quasimodes, P (δλ) for the lasing peaks
[Fig. 2(b)] did not ﬁt the Wigner-Dyson distribution,
which held for the quasimodes of the colloidal solution
without dye. The statistical distribution of decay rate of
the quasimodes could not be used for the calculation of
P (I/hIi). Moreover, the mode competition and gain sat-
uration, as well as the initial spontaneous emission into
individual modes, must be taken into account. The rapid
variation of gain in time and space make the explanation
of intensity statistics even more diﬃcult not only for the

4

lasing peaks but also for the ASE spikes. We hope our
data will stimulate further theoretical work.

In summary, we demonstrate experimentally the spec-
tral correlation and intensity statistics for the lasing
modes in a weakly scattering system are very diﬀerent
from those for the ASE spikes. Since the ASE spikes
originate from independent spontaneous emission events,
their frequencies are uncorrelated,
leading to Poisson
statistics for their spectral spacing. The lasing peaks rep-
resent the lasing modes, which can be drastically diﬀerent
from the quasimodes due to local pumping. Even with-
out reabsorption outside the pumped region, the number
of potential lasing modes may be greatly reduced by local
excitation of a weakly scattering system. The selective
ampliﬁcation of the feedback from the scatterers within
the gain region can make the spatial proﬁle of the lasing
mode very diﬀerent from that of the quasimode.

Abstract

We study the excitation, decay and interactions of novel, velocity locked three-wave parametric

solitons in a medium with quadratic nonlinearity and dispersion. We analytically describe the

particle-like scattering between stable or unstable soliton triplets with linear waves in terms of

explicit solutions featuring accelerated or decelerated solitons.

Three-wave resonant interactions (TWRI) are widespread in various branches of physics,

as they describe the resonant mixing of waves in weakly nonlinear and dispersive media.

The TWRI model is typically encountered in the description of any conservative nonlinear

medium where the nonlinear dynamics can be considered as a perturbation of the linear

waves solution, the lowest-order nonlinearity is quadratic in the ﬁeld amplitudes and the

phase-matching (or resonance) condition is satisﬁed. Solutions to the TWRI have been

known for a long time [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and extensive applications are found in nonlin-

ear optics (parametric ampliﬁcation, frequency conversion, stimulated Raman and Brillouin

scattering), plasma physics (laser-plasma interactions, radio frequency heating, plasma insta-

bilities), acoustics (light-acoustic interactions), ﬂuid dynamics (interaction of water waves)

and solid state physics (wave-wave scattering). Soliton solutions of TWRI are of partic-

ular interest in the study of coherent energy transport and frequency conversion. Indeed,

solitons behave as particles: as a result, diﬀerent waves belonging to the same soliton may

propagate locked together as a single entity. Such eﬀect has no counterpart for linear waves

[1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In a related paper [13], we discovered a novel multi-parameter TWRI

soliton family consisting of a triplet of bright-bright-dark waves (or simulton) that travel

with a common velocity. We could also identify the conditions for stable (fast) and unstable

(slow) solitons. The fate of the unstable solitons however remained unknown.

In this Letter, the solution of this problem is fully reported by giving, strikingly enough,

an analytic exact solution which describes the entire evolution of the unstable solitons. In

fact, we reveal and explore a novel consequence of the particle-like nature of TWRI simultons

(TWRIS), namely their inelastic scattering with particular linear waves. Such phenomenon

is associated with the excitation (decay) of stable (unstable) simultons by means of the

absorption (emission) of the energy carried by an isolated linear pulse. The decay (excita-

tion) of simultons is associated with their speed-up (slowing-down) and creation of another

triplet with complementary stability properties. As shown below, such processes are ex-

actly described in terms of an analytical higher-order soliton solution with varying speed,

or boomeron. The present TWRIS scattering process may be pictured as the interaction

of radiation with a two-level atomic system: transitions among excited and ground soliton

states are induced by the absorption and spontaneous emission of a wave.

The coupled partial diﬀerential equations that rule TWRI in (1 + 1) dimensions read as

where the subscripts t and z denote derivatives in the longitudinal and transverse dimensions,

En = En(z, t) are the complex wave amplitudes with velocities Vn, and n = 1, 2, 3. We chose

here V1 > V2 > V3 which, together with the above choice of the signs before the quadratic

terms, entails the non-explosive character of the three-wave interaction [7]. In the following,

with no loss of generality, we shall consider Eqs.(1) in a reference frame with V3 = 0. Since

we consider resonant interactions, the frequencies and momenta of the three waves must

satisfy the prescriptions ω1 + ω2 + ω3 = 0 and k1 + k2 + k3 = 0.

The TWRI equations (1) represent an inﬁnite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, which

conserves the Hamiltonian, the sum of the energies of waves E1 and E2, the sum of the

energies of waves E2 and E3, and the total transverse momentum (see Ref. [13] for details).

Equations (1) exhibit a three-parameter family of simulton solutions in the form of bright-

bright-dark triplets that travel with a common, or locked velocity V [13]. The most remark-

able physical property of these simultons is that their speed V may be continuously varied

by means of adjusting the energy of the two bright pulses. The propagation stability analysis

of TWRIS reveals that a triplet is no longer stable whenever its velocity V decreases below

a well deﬁned (critical) value, namely V < Vcr = 2V1V2/(V1 + V2) [13]. As an example,

in Fig. 1(a) we show the contour plot of the amplitude of the three waves that compose

an unstable simulton. These plots should be compared with Fig. 1(b), obtained from the

numerical propagation with an initial (i.e., at t = −5) condition given by the exact simulton

solution of Fig. 1(a). The results of Fig. 1 illustrate that an unstable simulton with V < Vcr

decays into a stable simulton with V > Vcr. This process is accompanied by the emission

of an isolated pulse in wave E3. It is quite remarkable that the simulton decay and wave

emission as it is numerically observed in Fig. 1(b) may be exactly reproduced in terms of

an analytical higher-order soliton solution with varying speed, or boomeron. Such solution

was found by means of the techniques described in Ref.[14], and it can be expressed as

It is worth noting that the above solution depends upon seven real parameters

V1, V2, p, k, q, a, θ. From the deﬁnition of Q, it is apparent that these parameters must be

chosen in such a way that if k = 0, then p2 > a2.

The analytical solution (2), while rather complicate at intermediate times, asymptotically

consists of one or two coherent structures. In fact, let us consider ﬁrst the decay process: if

we assume p < 0, for negative large t (t → −∞) the boomeron is asymptotically composed

of two bright pulses (E1, E2) and a kink-like pulse (E3) travelling with the locked velocity

Vi. If instead t is large and positive (t → +∞) the boomeron is composed of two bright

pulses (E1, E2) and a kink-like pulse (E3) traveling at the locked velocity Vf (Vf > Vi), plus

another pulse (E3) that travels with the linear group velocity V3. The velocities Vf and Vi

can be calculated from (2):

FIG. 1: a) Analytical solution; b) numerical propagation of an unstable TWRIS, which coincides

with a boomeron solution. Here V1 = 2, V2 = 1. The simulton velocity is V = 1.1 (V < Vcr ≈ 1.3).

The triplet travelling at very large |t| with the locked velocity Vi (Vf ) is itself an exact solution

of Eqs.(1), namely it is the unstable (stable) TWRIS as presented in Ref.[13]. Therefore the

boomeron solution (2) provides the exact description of the decay from unstable into stable

solitons.

Let us consider next the situation where a stable TWRIS collides with an isolated pulse

in the wave E3, namely the excitation by absorption. Once again, this scattering process is

exactly described by the boomeron solution (2), and it leads to the excitation of an unstable

TWRIS, induced by the absorption of the isolated wave E3. Indeed, whenever p > 0 and t is

very large and negative, the boomeron (2) is composed of a triplet consisting of two bright

pulses (in waves E1, E2) and a kink-like pulse (in wave E3), all traveling with the same

velocity Vi, plus an isolated pulse in wave (E3) that travels with the linear group velocity

V3. The triplet and the isolated pulse collide and, as a result, the pulse in E3 is completely

absorbed by the triplet. Finally, for very large and positive t the boomeron consists of a

single triplet formed by two bright pulses (in waves E1, E2) and a kink-like pulse (in wave

E3), again traveling together with the velocity Vf (Vf < Vi). Note that the asymptotic

boomeron triplets traveling with velocities Vi and Vf can be analytically mapped into the

stable and unstable TWRIS as given in [13]. In conclusion, the analytical solution (2) with

p > 0 provides the exact description of the excitation of an unstable TWRIS as a result of

the inelastic collision between a stable TWRIS and a linear wave packet.

FIG. 2: a) Analytical boomeron solution describing the collision of a stable TWRIS with a single

pulse in wave E3. Parameters are V1 = 2, V2 = 1, V3 = 0, p = 1, a = 1, k = 0.5, q = 1, θ = π/6. The

triplet velocities are Vi = 1.8 and Vf = 1.1 (Vcr ≈ 1.3). b) Numerical double scattering process.

Figure 2(a) displays the analytical boomeron solution corresponding to the collision be-

tween a stable TWRIS and a pulse in wave E3. Whereas Fig. 2(b) shows the inelastic

scattering of the TWRIS and the linear wave as numerically computed by integrating the

equations (1) with the initial data at t = −0.5 equal to the solution of Fig. 2(a). As it can

be seen in Fig. 2(b), the excited unstable TWRIS has a ﬁnite lifetime since it eventually

decays into a stable or ground state TWRIS via the emission of another linear wave. It is

worth noting that both the excitation and the decay processes may described by properly

adjusting the parameters of Eqs.(2).

The dynamics of the scattering between TWRIS and linear waves is analogous to the

interaction between radiation and a two-level atom.

Indeed, transitions between excited

and ground soliton states are induced by the absorption and spontaneous emission of a

linear pulse in the wave E3.

Let us now brieﬂy discuss the role of the various parameters in Eqs. (2). Two of these

parameters (i.e. the velocities V1 and V2) are ﬁxed by the linear dispersive properties of the

medium. We are thus left with ﬁve independent real parameters, namely p, k, q, a, θ (with

the restrictions a > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π). We point out that our discussion above implies that

the speciﬁcation of these parameters allows one to deﬁne the properties of both unstable

and stable TWRIS since these solitons result as asymptotic states of the analytic boomeron

expression (2) in the limit as |t| → ∞. The parameter p is associated with the rescaling of

the wave amplitudes, and of the coordinates z and t. Whereas a measures the amplitude of

the kink background in wave E3. The value of k is related to the soliton wavenumber. The

parameter q simply adds a phase shift which is linear in both z and t. Finally, θ ﬁxes the

shape of the stationary kink pulse E3. By adjusting the various degrees of freedom of the

boomeron family of solutions (2), one may foresee the dynamical reshaping of the amplitude,

phase, and velocity of the TWRIS, as well as fully describe the process of energy exchange

among the three waves.

In order to emphasize the novel and striking features of the scattering between TWRIS

and linear waves, let us brieﬂy consider now, the collisions between diﬀerent TWRIS. Since

7

Eqs.(1) are completely integrable, interactions between two initially well-separated TWRIS

do not modify the shapes of triplets that emerge after the collision. Indeed, the numerical

simulation of Fig. 3 shows that two TWRIS with diﬀerent velocities penetrate and cross

each other with no change of their shapes. The only eﬀect of the interaction is a spatial shift

and a phase shift, as it happens with ordinary bright TWRI solitons [10]. However, in a

manner similar to cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger solitons ([15, 16], [17] and references therein),

whenever the initial simulton separation is reduced, complex interaction phenomena may

take place owing to the excitation of higher order soliton solutions. For example, Fig. 4(a)

shows that two equal and in-phase TWRIS with the same velocity attract each other and

periodically collapse. Whereas Fig. 4(b) shows that a repulsive force exists between two

equal and out-of-phase solitons with the same velocity (the phase diﬀerence α between the

two solitons is imposed by multiplying the wave E1, respectively E2, of one of the solitons by

the phase factor exp[iα], respectively exp[−iα]). In this case, two distinct TWRIS moving

with diﬀerent velocities emerge from the initial collision. Hence TWRI solitons may cross,

attract or repel each other depending on their initial separation, velocity diﬀerence, and

relative phase.

In conclusion, we described in terms of analytical solutions the scattering process of

three-wave simultons and linear waves. An unstable simulton decays into a stable simulton

by accelerating its speed and emitting an isolated pulse. Moreover, a stable triplet may be

excited into an unstable simulton by slowing down as a result of the absorption of a linear

wave. Finally, simultons with diﬀerent speeds are stable upon collision, and simultons with

equal speeds interact with each other in a way which is strongly dependent upon their initial

relative phase.

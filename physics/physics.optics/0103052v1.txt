ABSTRACT

New improvements to compute Mie scattering quantities are presented. They are
based on a detailed analysis of the various sources of error in Mie computations and on
mathematical justiﬁcations. The algorithm developed on these improvements proves to

1. INTRODUCTION

The Mie theory of light scattering by a homogeneous sphere is used for many prob-
lems of atmospheric optics and also in other ﬁelds in Physics. The application of Mie
theory still needs modern computers for numerical calculations of the many functions and
coeﬃcients involved. The primary diﬃculty is in the precise evaluation of expansion coef-
ﬁcients an and bn. This is further aggravated as x gets large, and when the calculation of
size distribution is needed. An optimization of computer time for reliable computation is
clearly of necessity.

The formulas for Mie scattering are well known1,2. Here we follow the notation of

Bohren and Huﬀman3. The scattering and extinction eﬃciency factors are given by

Presently, there are many versions of Mie scattering computer codes (Dave5,6,
Blattner7, Grehan and Gouesbet8,9, Wiscombe10,11, Goedecke et al.12, Miller13) and au-
thors who had been doing Mie calculations (Kattawar and Plass14, Deirmendjian15, Quen-
zel and M¨uller16, Bohren and Huﬀman3). These are reﬂected in performing our work.

Some essential points should be addressed by any Mie scattering algorithm:

1) How to determine the number N for truncating a Mie series.

2) Whether the Riccati-Bessel functions will be computed by upward recursion or by

downward recursion.

3) If downward recursion is used, how to initialize it.

4) How to structure the algorithm in an eﬃcient way.

Answers to all the above questions constitute the objective of this paper. We focus
particularly on analyzing the numerical error sources and show that our Mie algorithm
permits users to prescribe a precision ǫ beforehand, to eﬀect an eﬃcient, reliable Mie
coeﬃcients calculation. Needless to say, the precisely evaluated Mie coeﬃcients an, bn are
required for calculating the angular scattering amplitudes1,2,3,5,6,10.

2. CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF THE MIE SERIES

In this section we shall estimate the error introduced in some typical quantity such
as the eﬃciency factors, by keeping a ﬁnite number N of partial waves in the Mie series.
We shall also ﬁnd a criterion for choosing the value of N . In this section the quantities
an, bn themselves are assumed to be computed exactly.

In order to investigate the convergence properties of the scattering coeﬃcients an, bn
we shall make use of very well known properties of the spherical Bessel functions (e.g. ref.
4, p. 438 and ﬀ.). Let us recall some properties which are relevant for us:

i)

lim
n→∞

ψn(z) = 0 ,

lim
n→∞

ζn(z) =

.

∞

(5)

ii) For z = x real, ψn(x) and ζn(x) have two distinct regimes as functions of n:

a) oscillating regime for n < x. ψn(x) and ζn(x) keep changing their sign regularly,

and

ψn(x)

and

ζn(x)

are bounded by slowly changing functions of n.

|

|

|

|

b) exponential regime for n > x. ψn(x) becomes exponentially decreasing and

ζn(x)

|

|

becomes exponentially increasing.

In view of these considerations one concludes from eqn. (2), that all the partial
waves n < x (x being the size parameter from now on) will contribute to the Mie series
and convergence will appear only after n enters in the exponential regime. This is so
because ψn(x), ψ′
n(x) go to
inﬁnity in the denominator. On the other hand ψn(y), ψ′
n(y) appear both in numerator
and denominator and therefore seem to play no role in the convergence. We can emphasize

n(x) go very quickly to zero in the numerator and ζn(x), ζ ′

where we have extracted the factor ψn(x)/ζn(x) responsible for the convergence of an and
bn and also we have reexpressed the ratios ψ′

Let us state more clearly our assumption: we shall assume that the quantities
[a]n, [b]n are bounded by slowly varying functions of n in the exponential regime n > x.
The validity of this assumption will be analyzed in a later section.

If [a]n and [b]n are well behaved for large n, we can approximate them by their
asymptotic values in order to discuss the convergence of an and bn. In order to take ad-
vantage of this approximation we can use the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel functions
for large orders (ref. 4, p. 365),

Using this and the asymptotic values (8), it can be shown that the truncation error in Qe
is bounded by

The proof is presented in Appendix I where it is shown that the series

Let us now ﬁnd a criterion for choosing the number N of partial waves that should

Putting together the bound (11), the criterion (12) and the estimate (10) we ﬁnd

the following prescription

4, p.439)

ψn−1(x)ζn(x) = i,

and the asymptotic values of An(x) and Bn(x). In this way we obtain (within approxima-
tions keeping the order of magnitude)

cause by doing so N may increase at most by one unit (recall that ζn(x)/ζn−1(x)
Also we have used that Re ζn(x) = ψn(x) is negligible as compared to Im ζn(x) in the ex-
ponential region.

≈

It is remarkable that the value of N obtained from (16) for ǫ = 10−8 is virtually
identical to the standard prescription N = x + c x1/3 + 1, with c = 4.3. It is shown in
Appendix II that it must be so using asymptotic expansions for ζn(x), and also how to
modify c if some other precision ǫ is desired. To know N (x) in advance is necessary if the
computer code is to be vectorized10,11.

3. NUMERICAL ERROR AND UPWARD RECURRENCE

In this section we shall discuss the propagation of numerical error through the

calculation.

5

It is known that the determination of ψn(z) by upward recursion is intrinsically
unstable (see e.g. ref. 5). Let us clarify this point.* For the sake of simplicity let us
assume that the numerical error is coming from the initial values

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

˜ψ0(z) = ψ0(z) + ǫ0,

˜ψ1(z) = ψ1(z) + ǫ1

but the recursion itself is free of roundoﬀ error, i.e.

˜ψn+1(z) = Fn(z) ˜ψn(z)

˜ψn−1(z)

−

−

′

ǫ0, ǫ1 being small numbers depending on the precision of the computer, and ˜ψn(z) being the
numerical sequence that is actually obtained instead of the exact one, ψn(z). Subtracting
the exact recursion for ψn(z) from (18) we ﬁnd

δψn+1(z) = Fn(z)δψn(z)

δψn−1(z)

where δψn(z) = ˜ψn(z)
ψn(z) is the error in our numerical sequence. Any sequence
satisfying the recurrence relation (4) is a linear combination of ψn(z) and ζn(z), therefore

−

δψn(z) = ηψn(z) + η

ζn(z)

The small numbers η, η′ are directly related to ǫ0, ǫ1 through eqn. (17), namely

η = i(ǫ0ζ1 −
i(ǫ0ψ1 −
=
η
−
Recalling now that ζn(z) diverges for large n we conclude that the absolute error in ˜ψn(z)
will eventually blow up. More generally, if the recursion itself is not exact due to computer
roundoﬀ error, ˜ψn(z) is rather given by

ǫ1ψ0)

ǫ1ζ0)

(21)

′

δψn(z) = ηnψn(z) + η

′
nζn(z)

(22)

where ηn, η′
n are of the order of the roundoﬀ error or the initial values error, whichever the
largest. In any case the conclusion is still that δψn(z) is small for small n (or while n is in
the oscillating regime for z nearly real), but blows up when n enters in the exponentially
increasing regime of ζn(z). Since ψn(z) itself goes to zero in the exponential regime, ˜ψn(z)
has less and less correct ﬁgures at each step.

We can extract some corollaries from the previous discussion:

1) The upward recursion is always unstable for computing ψn(z) for large n, de-
pending on z. The error δψn(z) grows as
. On the other hand the upward recursion
ζn(z)
is perfectly stable for computing ζn(x) for any value of n. This is because δζn(x) still

grows as
relative error in the quantity Re ζn(x) = ψn(x) is not at all small.

, therefore the relative error in ζn(x) is kept small. Note however that the

ζn(x)

|

|

2) A downward recursion is stable for computing ψn(z), because

is either
slowly changing (in the oscillating regime) or quickly decreasing with decreasing n (in the
exponential regime). This allows for taking even very rough estimates for the initial values
of ψn(z) in the downward recursion and the ratio ˜ψn−1(z)/ ˜ψn(z) will still quickly approach
the exact value An(z). On the other hand, a downward recursion is not appropriate for
computing ζn(x) or the ratio Bn(x) if it starts in the exponential regime.

ζn(z)

|

|

Now let us study the inﬂuence of the numerical error on the an, bn coeﬃcients, and

and Bn(x) are assumed to be exact due to previous considerations. On the other hand
An(y) is also assumed to be exact. The eﬀect of using approximate values of ψn(y) will be
considered later. We can make the discussion for an. Similar conclusions will hold for bn.
Eqn. (6) can be rewritten as

where only the An(x) dependence is shown explicitly as it is the only relevant one for error
analysis. The relative error in an will be given by

an =

.

Recalling the deﬁnition (7), the relative error in An can be estimated to be of the same
order of magnitude as that of ψn, and taking into account that f is a smooth function of
the order of unity (cf. eqn. (10)), one gets the estimate

where use has been made of eqn. (22) and η′ is some typical value of η′
n.

This means that the absolute error in an or bn, remains roughly constant throughout
the computation. Of course eqn. (24) holds only for small δψn, but this is guaranteed
as N is of the order of x and so the recurrence does not go deep inside the exponential
region. The important consequence of eqn. (25) is that the upward recursion can be used
to obtain ψn(x) because the error introduced is of the order of the roundoﬀ error (see
however the comment at the end of Section 6). Let us note that this fact is consistent
with available algorithms for doing Mie calculations, where ψn(x) and ζn(x) are always
computed by upward recursion (e.g. refs. 5,11).

Let us consider now the eﬀect of the numerical error coming form ψn(y). We have
argued before that an upward recursion would not be appropriate for computing ψn(z) in
general, however we have just shown that it can be used in the case of ψn(x). The reason

7

(23)

(24)

(25)

for this was that the relative error in ψn(x) grew as ζn(x)/ψn(x) but the quantities an and
bn themselves converged to zero as ψn(x)/ζn(x). Both factors cancel rendering δan and
δbn bounded. We cannot apply a similar argument to δψn(y) and therefore an upward
recursion is not reliable to compute ψn(y) for arbitrary y. We can consider two limiting
cases

a) mI = 0. In this case y is real and greater than x, thus the instability in ψn(y) starts

only after that in ψn(x), therefore the upward recursion can be used.

b) Large mI . From the initial values4

To summarize, the upward recursion to compute ψn(y) can be used if mI is small
enough but becomes unstable for large mI . We have not analyzed in any detail in which
cases the upward recursion for ψn(y) is reliable, therefore we shall only consider downward
recurrences for this quantity. See however refs. 10,11 for an extensive analysis of this
problem through computer experiments. Noting that all we need is the ratio An(y), for

Computing the initial value AN (y) requires some algorithm such as that of Lentz17 or the
one we present in the next section. Let us estimate now the precision required in AN (y) in
order not to introduce an error in Qe larger than the prescribed precision ǫ. By arguments
similar to those used for ψn(x), we have

4. INITIALIZATION OF THE DOWNWARD RECURRENCE

In this section we present a new method to compute AN (z), of similar eﬃciency to
that due to Lentz17 (actually ours needs one multiplication less at each step). This method
has the advantage of being able to implement a precision condition as that in eqn. (32),
hence controlling the required precision in An(y).

Let Xn(z) and Yn(z) be two sequences satisfying the recurrence (4) for some value
of z (the dependence on z is irrelevant here). Then they will satisfy the Wronskian identity

where C is independent of n. We can rewrite it as a diﬀerence equation

and solve it in Xn

D being a constant. To write (35) we have assumed that Yn is a sequence going to inﬁnity
for large n, which is true for almost any solution of the recurrence (4). If we take Yn as a
ﬁxed sequence and regard C, D as free parameters, then Xn is the most general solution of

(30)

(31)

(33)

(34)

(35)

the recurrence relation (4). In particular for D = 0, Xn goes to zero as n goes to inﬁnity,
as a consequence it must be proportional to ψn,

About the convergence of the series in (39), we note that it is very fast when Yk enters
in its exponential regime. Note that for real y the convergence begins only after k
y.
A similar conclusion was reached by other authors11 in Lentz’s method which basically
follows the same principle as ours and so has similar convergence properties.

The sequence in eqn.

(39) must be truncated at some value k = M in such a
way as to fulﬁll the requirement (32). This can be easily done by noting that the error

5. COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHM

Using the previous ideas, we have developed a computational algorithm which we
shall brieﬂy describe now. The input is x, m and ǫ and the main output are the coeﬃcients
an and bn, and N . To start with, analytic expressions for ζ0(x) and ζ1(x) are taken
to initiate an upward recurrence for ζn(x). This quantity is kept in a (complex) array
variable. The recurrence stops when the condition (16) is fulﬁlled, providing the value
of N . The quantities ψn(x) are automatically obtained as the real part of ζn(x). As a
second step, AN (y) is computed using eqns. (38), (39) and (42). Here we note that from a
computational point of view an equivalent form of (42) is more convenient, which consist
in doing the check for the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts. This is much
faster than computing the modulus of a complex number.

Then a downward recurrence is performed for An(y), eqn. (28), until n = 1. Si-
multaneously, an and bn are computed using ζn(x) and An(y). The quantities Qs and Qe
can then be computed. We have not developed any especial algorithm for computing the
scattering amplitudes S1 and S2. To do this eﬃciently see for instance ref. 11.

The criteria developed above are intended to be robust, hence they are rather con-
servative. As a consequence the error in Qe is smaller than the prescribed precision ǫ. This
is especially true for small values of x, whereas for x
1, about two more ﬁgures than
expected are obtained. We point out also that Qs is always obtained as accurately as Qe
or more. This fact was expected because the criteria were stated for
while Qs goes as

6. RESONANT TERMS IN THE MIE SERIES

Let us recall that after eqn. (7) we stated a smoothness assumption for the quantities
[a]n, [b]n, namely that they are nearly constant in the x exponential regime and do not
play any role in the convergence of the Mie series, which is only controlled by the ratio
ψn(x)/ζn(x). In particular this assumption implied that the highest partial wave with a
relevant contribution is independent of m (cf. eqn. (16)). In other words, N is a function of
x only. This result is also supported numerically, (see for instance refs. 10,11). Therefore
it was a surprise for us to discover that strictly speaking such a statement must be false.
Moreover, for any choice of N as a function of x only, and for any prescribed value of n,
n > N , one can always pick a value of m (in fact inﬁnitely many of them) in such a way
that the n-th term in the Mie series is not negligible, for instance one can make an = 1.
The consequence of this that in order to guarantee that the numerical value of Qe is correct
within some prescribed precision, N should depend on m as well as on x.

In order to clarify the point let us consider the worst case, which is also the simplest,
namely mI = 0, i.e. y real. This is the only case in which
can reach the value
1. The point can be made for an: recalling that for z real Re ζn(z) = ψn(z), eqn. (2) can

where Dn is a complex quantity. Obviously an = 1 if and only if

Let us regard x and n as given and look for solutions of (45) in the variable y. The equation
can be rewritten as

Im Dn = 0 .

In the interval y > n, ψn(y) is a real oscillating function of y with inﬁnitely many zeroes.
Between two zeroes of ψn(y), the l.h.s. of eqn. (46) takes every real value, therefore there
are inﬁnitely many solutions to our equation for any values of x and n, no matter how large
is n as compared to x. For these values of x, m, and n, an will not at all be negligible.

Let us now show that these resonances do not occur for unrealistic values of m.
Typically (and asymptotically for large y) the distance between two consecutive zeroes of
ψn(y) is of the order of π, therefore for given x and n the lowest resonant value of m will
occur near the interval ( n
x ) approximately. For large x this happens for m near to
unity, and all the other resonant values will follow at a distance of about π/x from each
other.

x , n+π

From a rigorous point of view these ﬁndings would invalidate the estimates (10) and
their consequences. They would also invalidate any algorithm in which N depends on x
only, namely every existent algorithm known to us. In fact the only practical way to make
sure that the resonant partial waves have been accounted for would be to take N greater
than y in order to guarantee that ψn(y) has no zeroes for n > N .

Nevertheless it is clear that in practice the existent algorithms to do Mie scattering
calculations work. To account for this fact we should consider not only the existence of
resonant partial waves but also their width. Let us show that for sensible choices of N (as
a function of x) and for n > N the resonances are so narrow that they will not normally
show up. Let y0 be one the values of y such that an = 1. A look to eqn. (44) shows
that for generic y, Re Dn goes as ψn(x) whereas Dn goes as ζn(x), therefore an is very
small. However for the especial value y0 there is a cancellation between two huge numbers
in Im Dn, leaving an of the order of unity. The range of values of y for which a partial
cancellation takes place is related to the slope of Dn in y = y0, namely

we can see that m or x should be ﬁne tuned at least with a precision ǫ in order to pick
a resonant term for some n > N . On the other hand, except for these rare cases, an, bn
are indeed small and of the order of ψn(x)/ζn(x), therefore our analysis applies. If m is
allowed to be complex, a more involved analysis would be needed, but we expect that the
conclusion would not diﬀer.

Let us ﬁnally note another consequence of the resonant terms on the calculation,
even when they are taken into account. For one of these terms the quantity f in eqn. (23)
is no longer of the order of unity, on the contrary it is rather large, and the last step in
eqn. (25) cannot be taken. This means that a resonant term ampliﬁes the error due to
ψn(x). The cure is simply to compute ψn(x) by downward recursion for x < n < N . This
has in fact been observed in selected quantities such as the backscattering eﬃciency for
suitable values of x and m (Ref. 5).

7. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have addressed several points relevant to Mie scattering calcula-

tions. To be speciﬁc:

a) We have estimated the error introduced in the calculation by truncating the Mie
series, thereby ﬁnding a prescription for choosing N . We have found that in the generic
case N depends on x only.

b) The possible instabilities in the recursions used to compute ψn and ζn have been
analyzed. We have found that upward recursion is always unstable for computing ψn(z)
if n is large enough. However it can be used to compute ψn(x) in Mie calculations. As a
matter of fact ψn(x) is computed in this way in nowadays available algorithms. We have
also found that upward recursion can be used for ψn(y) if mI is small enough, but no
criterion is given for how small mI should be.

c) A criterion has been established for the allowed error in ψn−1(y)/ψn(y).

d) A new method to compute ψn−1(y)/ψn(y) is presented which is eﬃcient and

allows for controlling the error and removing ill-conditioning.

e) It has been shown the existence of resonant terms in the Mie series which can also
appear for n > N . Strictly speaking the existence of these terms invalidates any algorithm
in which N is a function of x only. However we have also shown that those resonant terms
are extremely rare, namely they appear with a probability of the order of ǫ.

A speciﬁc algorithm is also described. It is meant to be robust and eﬃcient for a
wide range of size parameters and refractive indices. With this algorithm we have written
the computer program LVEC-MIE18, which is available both in single and double precision
contacting V.E. Cachorro.

In order to know in advance the value of N that will be obtained from the prescrip-
(x), Yν(z) being the

tion (16) for given x and ǫ, let us recall that Im ζn(x) =
Bessel function of the second kind. Let ν and c be deﬁned by

The right hand side of (II.4) has a very strong dependence on c whereas it depends very
smoothly on ν. Actually (ν/2√2)1/6 is of the order of unity for ν = 1 up to 105. Therefore
using eqn. (16), c will be determined by ǫ. We ﬁnd that c = 4.3 corresponds to ǫ = 10−8.
Other values are c = 4.0, ǫ = 10−7, and c = 5.0, ǫ = 10−10, computed for ν = 100 in
(II.4).

Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that imaging with resolution well beyond
the diﬀraction limit can be obtained with so-called superlenses. Images formed by such superlenses
are, however, in the near ﬁeld only, or a fraction of wavelength away from the lens. In this paper, we
propose a far-ﬁeld superlens (FSL) device which is composed of a planar superlens with periodical
corrugation. We show in theory that when an object is placed in close proximity of such a FSL, a
unique image can be formed in far-ﬁeld. As an example, we demonstrate numerically that images
of 40 nm lines with a 30 nm gap can be obtained from far-ﬁeld data with properly designed FSL
working at 376nm wavelength.

INTRODUCTION

Conventional optical

lens imaging suﬀers from the
diﬀraction limit which originates from the loss of evanes-
cent waves that cannot travel to the far ﬁeld. In the near-
ﬁeld, an object under illumination scatters both propa-
gating and evanescent waves. Propagating waves carry
the low spatial resolution information on the ﬁeld mod-
ulation up to λ0/n, where λ0 is the illumination wave-
length in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the
surrounding medium. On the other hand, information
on modulation of the ﬁeld smaller than λ0/n are carried
by evanescent waves.

One promising approach of

imaging beyond the
diﬀraction limit emerged with the recent proposal of
superlenses[1]. Basically a superlens is made of a slab of
material that can support surface waves along the slab
from electromagnetic excitation.
In contrast with con-
ventional material for which evanescent waves decays,
using a superlens, evanescent waves can be transmit-
ted with enhanced amplitude resulting from the surface
wave excitation. Therefore a superlens has the ability
to eﬀectively recover the evanescent components radi-
ated by the object in the image plane[2][3]. A good im-
age can be obtained if the enhancement of evanescent
waves by the superlens occurs within a broadband of
spatial frequency. A superlens can be constructed from
metamaterial with eﬀective negative index media[4][5]
consisting of metallic resonators, and dielectric[6][7][8]or
metallic[9] photonic crystals consisting of periodically
varying dielectric material. Also a superlens can be built
from a slab of natural material that can support sur-
face wave polaritons[3][10][11] with either negative per-

mittivity or negative permeability. Experimental studies
have demonstrated superlens imaging both in microwave
regime[12] using a two dimensional photonic crystal and
in optical regime using a silver ﬁlm[3][13][14]. Although
the resolution of the superlens is still limited by the in-
ternal absorption losses of the materials due to inherent
in strongly dispersive material[15], imaging well beyond
the diﬀraction limit has been shown.

However, there is one drawback to the planar super-
lens. The superlens images are still in near-ﬁeld zone as
demonstrated by Podolskiy et al.[16], since the enhanced
evanescent waves remain evanescent after transmission
and vanish very quickly outside the superlens. Therefore,
a challenge remains as how to use the superlens eﬀect to
form an image in far ﬁeld with a resolution beyond the
diﬀraction limit.

Another approach to recover the evanescent waves is
to introduce an antenna into the near ﬁeld that interacts
with the evanescent waves and then radiates into the far

near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) where
optical nanoantennas such as plasmonic nanoparticles or
metallic tips are used. Considerable studies have been de-
voted to interpret the far-ﬁeld signals[17][18][19][20][21]
depending of the NSOM conﬁguration, and images with
resolution down to 10nm have been demonstrated possi-
ble. Nevertheless, NSOM do not project a physical im-
age as a conventional lens does, and the slow scan speed
prevents a dynamic imaging[22], often of practical impor-
tance.

In this letter, we show theoretically that a new de-
vice termed as far-ﬁeld superlens (FSL) can overcome
the near-ﬁeld limitation of a superlens, that is, in other
words, able to project in far-ﬁeld, an image of the evanes-
cent component of the near-ﬁeld. Moreover, we demon-
strate theoretically that the image is unique. The image
pattern is not a real space image, but rather provides the
information on the ob-
ﬁeld angular spectrum[23], i.e.
ject in spatial spectral domain. The far-ﬁeld signal can
be easily processed numerically in order to obtain a real
space image of the local ﬁeld distribution above the ob-

ject with a resolution beyond the diﬀraction limit. As
an example, a realistic design of an optical FSL made of
metal/dielectric is proposed from exact numerical calcu-
lation.

IMAGING THEORY WITH A FAR-FIELD
SUPERLENS MADE OF ARBITRARY
MATERIAL

Adding a periodic grating on a superlens positioned
in the near-ﬁeld above an object may help to realize a
lens-like imaging with a resolution below the diﬀraction
limit. However, the imaging capability of a grating is
not straightforward. Let us ﬁrst introduce some general
transmission properties of a grating without considering
the superlens eﬀect. We assume an object radiating op-
tical waves at a wavelength λ0 below a grating immersed
into the same medium with a refractive index . For the
sake of simplicity and without losing generality, we con-
sider a 2 dimensional problem where the material prop-
erties of both object and grating are function of (x, z)
and invariant along the y axis. The grating is periodic
along the x axis with a periodicity d. Periodic gratings
are known to be able to couple out evanescent waves into
propagating waves by a simple diﬀraction process. This
property can be understood by writing the for instance
the grating law:

k′ = k + pG,

(1)

where k′ and k are the transmitted and the incident
transverse wave number respectively; p is the diﬀraction
order; and G is the grating wave number of the grat-
ing. The transverse wave number is the projection of
the wavevector of a plane wave along the x axis. Trans-
verse wave number of evanescent waves are such that
|k| > nk0 where k0 = 2π/λ0, while transverse wave num-
ber of propagating waves satisfy to |k| < nk0. Incident
evanescent waves with a large k can be lowered by the
grating wave number using for instance the order p = −1
of diﬀraction. Evanescent waves can be converted by this
way into propagating waves that reach the far-ﬁeld if G
is large enough. But incident propagating waves would
be also transmitted in far-ﬁeld through the order p = 0
without wave number change. So that incident propagat-
ing and evanescent waves transmitted through the order
0 and −1 respectively will overlap in far-ﬁeld making it
diﬃcult to separate them for imaging purposes. Indeed,
waves transmitted in far-ﬁeld for instance with a trans-
verse wave number |k′| < nk0 are the results of the over-
lap of incident waves transmitted through several orders
p with transverse wave numbers satisfying:

kp = k′ − pG.

(2)

Let us write the relationship between the ﬁeld trans-
mitted in far-ﬁeld and the incident ﬁeld assuming TM
polarized waves where the magnetic ﬁeld H is oriented

2

along the y axis. The H-ﬁeld transmitted above the grat-
ing with and its angular spectrum[23] are noted Ht(x, z)
Ht(k′, z). Only plane waves with |k′| < nk0 that can
and
e
reach the far-ﬁeld are considered. The near ﬁeld radi-
ated by the object under the grating with z0 < z < z1
is noted Hobj(x, z). The near-ﬁeld can be decomposed
into a broadband angular spectrum of both propagating
(|k| < nk0) and evanescent (|k| > nk0) plane waves. Sep-
arated by a grating, those two angular spectra are linked
by a discrete linear summation of waves scattered into all
orders of diﬀraction:

Ht(k′, z2) =
e

+∞

X
p=−∞

tp(kp)

Hobj(kp, z1),
e

(3)

In Eq. (3), tp is the p-order ﬁeld transfer function of the
grating from z = z1 to z = z2, deﬁned as the ratio be-
tween the ﬁeld transmitted in the order p of diﬀraction,
and the ﬁeld of an incident plane wave. The transfer
function is a convenient tool commonly used in Fourier
optics[23] to describe the transmission properties of op-
tical system by plane waves. Transfer functions can be
either measured experimentally or numerically by solving
Maxwell’s equations.

In general, the original near-ﬁeld

Hobj(k, z1), cannot
e
be retrieved unambiguously from the far-ﬁeld measure-
ment of the angular spectrum
Ht(k, z) using Eq. (2-3)
e
because of an overlap of several incident plane waves with
diﬀerent kp scattered into with the same transverse wave
number k′ ( the same direction). In general, there is no
one-to-one relationship between the near-ﬁeld angular ra-
diated by the object and the far-ﬁeld angular spectrum
transmitted by a grating.

We demonstrate that this problem of the overlap of
waves transmitted through several order of diﬀraction
can be overcome by combining the superlens eﬀect to the
diﬀraction properties of a grating. The imaging prin-
ciples can be understood following a very simple pic-
ture. Let us look ﬁrst at transmission properties of a
planar superlens as show in Fig 1a. Transmitted ampli-
tude of incident evanescent waves (in black) are substan-
tially enhanced through the slab because of the super-
lens eﬀect. Comparatively incident propagating waves
are poorly transmitted (in red). However, after trans-
mission enhanced evanescent waves remain evanescent,
limiting imaging with a superlens in the near-ﬁeld zone.
In contrast, let us consider now transmission properties
of planar superlens corrugated with a subwavelength pe-
riodic structure termed as far-ﬁeld superlens (FSL). As
shown in Fig. 1b, a FSL not only enhances the incident
evanescent ﬁeld because of the excitation of surface waves
in the slab based superlens, but also eﬀectively convert
these waves into propagating waves by scattering through
a negative diﬀraction order of the grating following Eq 1.
Overall, these incident evanescent waves transmitted and
converted into propagating waves are projected in the far-
ﬁeld with large amplitude. In the others hand compared
to the transmission of incident evanescent waves, inci-

FIG. 1: Schematic picture of the transmission properties of a
conventional superlens versus a far-ﬁeld superlens. Through
a conventional superlens (a), incident evanescent waves are
enhanced in transmission and vanish quickly in the near-ﬁeld
zone. In contrast, a FSL (b) both enhances and converts them
into propagating waves by diﬀraction while blocking incident
propagating waves.

dent propagating waves are expected to be very poorly
transmitted in far-ﬁeld because of a lack of surface wave
excitation, This property may be written:

|t0(k − G)| << |t−1(k)|,

(4)

with |t0(k − G)| << |t−1(k)| within the bandwidth of
evanescent waves for which the superlens eﬀect occurs.
Let us note that a similar relation occurs for negative
transverse wave numbers if the grating has a -axis sym-
metry grating. If in addition, the superlens is designed
with a large transmission within selective bandwidth
k ∈ [G; nk0 + G], then the relationship between the far-
ﬁeld angular spectrum above the FSL and the near-ﬁeld
angular spectrum below the superlens given by Eq (2)

and (3) reduces to:

for the positive half-space 0 < k′ < nk0; and

Ht(k′, z1) = t+1(k)
e

Hobj(k, z) where k = k′ − G,
e

It follows from this result that any propagating wave
transmitted in far-ﬁeld by a FSL has a unique origin.
For a positive k′ for instance, the origin is the incident
evanescent wave that has been transmitted through the
diﬀraction order −1 with k = k′ + G. This property is
true for any k′ so that there is a unique one to one rela-
tionship between the near-ﬁeld angular spectrum under
the FSL and the transmitted angular spectrum in far-
ﬁeld above the FSL. This results means that when an ob-
ject is placed in close proximity of a FSL, a unique image
of the near-ﬁeld distribution can be projected in far-ﬁeld.
Moreover, using Eq. (5) and (6) and the rigorous diﬀrac-
tion theory[23], the near-ﬁeld angular spectrum radiated
by the object can be retrieved unambiguously from mea-
surement of the far-ﬁeld transmitted angular spectrum
Ht(k′, z).
e
If both amplitude and phase of the angular spectrum
can be measured in far-ﬁeld, then a real space image of
the near-ﬁeld
Hobj(k, z) above the object can be recon-
e
structed from Hobj(x, z) using a simple inverse Fourier
transform. However, the measurement of the phase is a
practical diﬃculty. This diﬃculty appears also in diﬀrac-
tion optical microscopy[24] where both amplitude and
phase of the angular spectrum have to be measured. For
this purpose, an experimental set-up such as the one use
by Lauer[24] based on interferometry may be a good ap-
proach. Alternatively, a direct real space image might be
obtained using the Fourier transform transmission prop-
erties of lens[23] and other optical devices.

In principle, the maximum spatial frequency of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld that a FSL can image in far-ﬁeld
is (n + λ0/d)k0. Consequently, the best transverse res-
olution ∆l that could be obtained on the image of the
local density of electromagnetic energy is:

∆l =

λ0
2(n + λ0/d)

.

(7)

By comparison,
the best resolution that could be
achieved with a diﬀraction limited microscope is λ0/2n
assuming a numerical aperture NA=n.

Using a FSL, we have demonstrated that the near-ﬁeld
angular spectrum and subsequently the local near-ﬁeld
distribution can be measured. However, the electromag-
netic distribution of the ﬁeld above the object depends
on how the object is exposed. For instance, in normal in-
cidence or with a grazing angle exposure by a plane wave,
the FSL would provide accordingly diﬀerent images. A
model is needed if one wants to image an intrinsic prop-
erty of the object that does not depend on the exposure
condition such as the local polarizability or the local ab-
sorptivity.

transmission of evanescent waves and convert them into prop-
agating waves through the order -1 while the transmission of
propagating waves through the order 0 is comparatively small.

III. CASE OF A SILVER FAR-FIELD
SUPERLENS

How to design such a FSL for which the transmission
properties satisfy to Eq (4) is a crucial question. One
may start from the design of a superlens slab that en-
hances strongly incident evanescent waves within a large
bandwidth. The enhancement can be provided by the
excitation of surface waves mode of the slab based su-
perlens. When a periodic corrugation is added on a su-
perlens, the surface modes supported by the slab become
leaky modes. As a result, as it was demonstrated by
Smith et al[25] in case of a superlens made of metamate-
rial with a negative refractive index, corrugations at the
interfaces of the superlens lead to smaller values of the en-
hancement of evanescent waves by the superlens. Despite
this expected diﬃculty, we have successfully designed an

4

optical FSL made of silver/glass with the proper trans-
fer functions satisfying to Eq (4), a necessary condition
for imaging purpose. Details on the design of this FSL
are provided in Ref.[26]. Feature sizes of this nanos-
tructure are shown in Fig 2a. This FSL has been de-
signed to work at λ0 = 376nm with TM polarized waves.
We have computed the transfer functions of this struc-
ture from z = z1 to the top z = z2 by solving numer-
ically Maxwell’s equations using the Rigorous Coupled
Wave Analysis (RCWA) algorithm[27][28] with experi-
mental permittivity data of glass ǫ = 2.31 and silver[29]
ǫ = −3.16 + 0.2i. The numerical solution provided has
been tested using the theorem of reciprocity of electro-
magnetic waves and was applied for both propagating
and evanescent waves[30][31]. The results of order 0 and
±1of the amplitude transfer functions are plotted in Fig.
2b. With a periodicity d = 150nm and the wavelength
λ0 = 376nm, incident transverse wave numbers trans-
mitted through the order −1 of the grating are shifted
by −2.5k0.

Fig. 2b clearly shows that Eq (4) is satisﬁed with
k ∈ [2.5; 4]k0, demonstrating that using a superlens pe-
riodically corrugated, a large bandwidth of evanescent
waves can be both enhanced and converted into propa-
gating waves with large amplitude, while incident propa-
gating waves are poorly transmitted. Consequently, this
FSL could be used for imaging with resolution well be-
low the diﬀraction limit. Fig 2b shows similarly that
|t0(k + G)| << |t+1(k)| with k ∈ [−4; −2.5]k0 .

silver,

In a superlens made of

surface plasmon
polaritons[32] (SPP) play a key role on the enhancement
of evanescent waves [2][3][13]. At a metal/dielectric inter-
face, SPP are surface waves resulting from the coupling
between p-polarized electromagnetic waves and the in-
duced collective excitation of free electrons in the metal.
In a silver ﬁlm superlens, the wavelength and the thick-
ness are chosen so that SPP can be excited within a large
bandwidth of transverse wave numbers[3][13]. How the
optical FSL presented in this letter has been designed in
close connection to SPP behavior, is detailed in Ref.[26].
Due to the position of the selective bandwidth of en-
hancement as shown Fig. 2b, waves transmitted into
order −1 and +1 can be substantially overlapped with
k ∈ [−0.2; 0.2].
For this reason, this small band-
width has to be omitted from the measurement in or-
der to retrieve the near-ﬁeld angular spectrum unam-
biguously. Finally, it can be deduced using Eq (5) and
(6) that the near ﬁeld angular spectrum
Hobj(k, z) with
e
k ∈ [−4; −2.7] ∪ [2.7; 4]k0 can be retrieved from the mea-
Ht(k′, z) with
surement of the far-ﬁeld angular spectrum
e
k′ ∈ [−1.5; −0.2] ∪ [0.2; 1.5]k0. Because this speciﬁc FSL
can resolve a transverse ﬁeld modulation with a maxi-
mum spatial frequency 4k0 , the transverse resolution on
the image of the local density of electromagnetic energy is
λ0/8. By comparison, the resolution of diﬀraction limited
microscope is λ0/3 with a numerical aperture N A = 1.5.
As an example, we provide the result of the image
reconstruction using a FSL, of an object constituted of

case a numerical aperture NA=1.5. Image of the density of
electromagnetic energy with the FSL is reconstructed using
Eq 5 and 6 and from the rigorous computation of the trans-
mitted angular spectrum in far-ﬁeld z >> λ0. This result
computed rigorously directly demonstrates the optical imag-
ing method with resolution below the diﬀraction limit from
Far-ﬁeld data, using a FSL made of silver/glass without any
scanning

two 40nm lines sources of coherent TM waves separated
by a deep subwavelength gap. A unity value of the H
component is assumed on the two-line sources and van-
ished everywhere else. The near ﬁeld computed at 5nm
above the object using rigorous diﬀraction theory[23],
is shown as the black curve in Fig. 3. For compari-
son, the computed diﬀraction limited image using con-
ventional optical microscope assuming a numerical aper-
ture N A = 1.5 is shown in blue in Fig 3. The optical
FSL described in Fig 2a is placed 20nm above the ob-
Ht(k′, z) transmitted by the

Ht(k′, z) provide
ing RCWA and Eq. (2-3). Values of

a complete set of data simulating a measured signals in
an experiment. These known data are used subsequently
for the image reconstruction. Because the designed sil-
ver FSL processes a unique one to one k′ → k relation,
it allows us to use this ”experimental” data to retrieve
the angular spectrum of the near-ﬁeld 5nm above the
object unambiguously only by using Eq.(5-6) and the
rigorous diﬀraction theory. By combining this angular
spectrum with its propagating component, we obtain the
near-ﬁeld angular spectrum 5nm above the object with
k ∈ [−4; −2.7] ∪ [−1.5; 1.5] ∪ [2.7; 4]k0. By applying a
simple inverse Fourier transform, we ﬁnally obtain suc-
cessively a reconstruction of the H-ﬁeld distribution and

5

the image of the density of electromagnetic energy 5nm
above the object. We have successively obtained faithful
images reconstruction from 120nm down to 30nm gap.
The case of 40nm gap is reported by the red curve in
Fig. 3 where the separation of the two lines source is very
clear. Let us note the formation of some artefacts[26] in
the image may appear because of the missing band in the
near-ﬁeld angular spectrum. The image in case of 30nm
gap (not shown) is the smallest gap between sources that
we have been able to demonstrate following the Rayleigh
criterion[33].

IV. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated theoretically how to overcome
the limitation of a conventional superlens for which only
images in the near-ﬁeld can be obtained[3][16]. We have
shown that when the object is positioned close to a new
device termed as the far-ﬁeld superlens (FSL), a unique
image of evanescent waves radiated by the object can be
formed in far-ﬁeld. In contrast to conventional near-ﬁeld
scanning optical microscope (NSOM), the FSL does not
require scanning. In this sense, a FSL is similar with con-
ventional lenses imaging with which a whole and unique
image of an object can be recorded in a single snap-shot.
From the measurement of the far-ﬁeld image pattern and
a simple inversion of the linear and scalar Eqs. (5) and
(6), the near-ﬁeld electromagnetic distribution above the
object can be obtained with a resolution beyond the
diﬀraction limit. By combining the superlens eﬀect and
the diﬀraction modes of a grating, the unique transmis-
sion properties of a FSL lies in a broadband excitation
of surface wave leaky modes used to convert the incident
near-ﬁeld angular spectrum into a transmitted far-ﬁeld
angular spectrum, related by a one to one relationship.
A realistic design of an optical FSL was given made of
silver/glass with such a transmission properties, owing to
the excitation of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) leaky
modes. This new imaging approach has the potential
to reach similar or better resolution than NSOM after
more development. Such a far ﬁeld superlens could have
great impact not only in nano-scale imaging but also in
nanolithography and photonic devices.

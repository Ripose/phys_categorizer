A bottleneck limiting the widespread application of photonic crystals is scattering of light by

unavoidable variations in size and position of the crystals’ building blocks. We present a new

model for both 2 and 3-dimensional photonic crystals that relates the resulting loss length to the

magnitude of the variations. The predicted lengths agree well with our experiments on high-quality

opals and inverse opals over a wide frequency range, and with literature data analyzed by us. In

state-of-the-art structures, control over photons is limited to distances of 50 lattice parameters

(∼ 15 µm). Consequently, applications of photonic crystals in optical integrated circuits remain a

fata morgana, unless an unprecedented reduction of the random variations is achieved.

Koenderink & Vos ‘Optical loss due to intrinsic structural variations of photonic ...’ 2

The promise of full control over emission and propagation of light has led to a widespread

pursuit of photonic crystals in recent years [1]. Photonic crystals are dielectric structures

in which the refractive index varies periodically over length scales comparable to the wave-

length of light. For three-dimensional periodicities, such crystals promise a photonic band

gap, i.e., a frequency range for which emission and propagation of light are completely for-

bidden. Ideally, photonic band gap crystals will form a backbone in which many photonic

devices, such as ultrasmall waveguides, cavities and light sources, are combined to create

optical integrated circuits [2]. This requires photonic crystals with negligible optical loss

over millimeter distances [2].

Tremendous progress has been made in the fabrication of photonic bandgap materials of

the required high refractive index-materials [3, 4, 5, 6]. These structures have point and

plane defect densities suﬃciently low for the band gap to survive [6]. Structural variations in

size and position of the building blocks, however, are intrinsic to three- and two-dimensional

(3D, resp. 2D) photonic crystals alike, and can be traced back to basic arguments in ther-

modynamics [7]. Indeed, in all current state-of-the-art photonic crystals the variations in

size and position amount to at least 2 to 7% [3, 8]. These unavoidable deviations from per-

fect periodicity cause scattering, and hence exponential attenuation of beams propagating

through photonic crystals over loss lengths ℓ, also known as the ‘mean free path’. After

propagating over a distance ℓ, a light beam is converted to a diﬀuse glow that corrupts

the functionality of any photonic integrated circuit. Therefore, it is crucial to obtain the

relation between the loss length ℓ and the structural disorder. In this paper, we derive such

a relation and test it against available experimental results.

We consider the loss in photonic crystals due to scattering by size polydispersity and

displacements from lattice sites of the structural units (typical size r) that compose the

unit cell (size a, the lattice spacing). Light scattering is caused only by the diﬀerence in

refractive index proﬁle of the displaced, slightly polydisperse building blocks as compared

to the ideally ordered structure. As sketched in Fig. 1, this diﬀerence is a collection of thin

shells of high and low index material. The polydispersity and displacements of the building

blocks translate into the shell thickness ∆r. We treat the ideal crystal as a homogeneous

medium with index neﬀ equal to the volume-averaged refractive index [9]. Each of the thin

shells has an extinction cross-section σ = Qσgeom that is a factor Q times the geometrical

cross-section σgeom. The light scattering from all shells adds up to the loss length equal to

Koenderink & Vos ‘Optical loss due to intrinsic structural variations of photonic ...’ 3

ℓ = 1/ρσ. The high shell density ρ is set by the number of structural units per unit cell

volume (β). Even though scattering by each shell is very weak, the huge density causes the

overall eﬀect of small variations to be an important scattering mechanism.

To evaluate the loss length, we only need to know the scattering eﬃciency Q per shell. As

each individual shell is weakly scattering, the Rayleigh-Gans approximation can be applied

to obtain the scattering eﬃciency [10]. We ﬁnd that the loss length ℓ in units of a is set by:

We now discuss 3D photonic crystals. Size polydispersity results in scattering due to thin

spherical shells with a Gaussian distribution of thicknesses. We ﬁnd that the inverse loss

a spread ∆r in their average radius r, each slightly displaced (displacement ∆u) from the lattice

sites. The real structure is the sum of the perfect crystal and the diﬀerence between the real and

perfect structure. This diﬀerence is a collection of thin shells that each scatter weakly. Due to

their high number density, the shells dominate the scattering loss.

and titania inverse opals (b). Open symbols in (b) were obtained by averaging total transmission

spectra for many samples with diﬀerent a. The blue shaded area indicates the standard deviation.

In the stop gap (orange bar), total transmission is reduced in excess of ℓ/L due to Bragg reﬂection

of the input beam. This aﬀects the data in this limited range but not our model. In both (a) and

(b), the loss length agrees well with the model (2) with ∆r/r ∼ 5% (red curves). Green curves

scales quadratically with the size polydispersity ∆r/r and with m − 1. In particular for

opals and inverse opals that consist of spheres (mean radius r), the increase of loss with

normalized frequency a/λ = ωa/(2πc) tends to a quadratic form, due to the form of F [11].

We have checked the validity of our result using the Mie-solution for spherical shells. This

exact model reproduces the quadratic scaling with relative variation ∆r/r and with contrast

m−1, though quantitative diﬀerences appear in the factor F for m > 2. Our model captures

both the eﬀect of polydispersity ∆r/r and displacements ∆u/r: calculations of F show that

both eﬀects are similar in magnitude, and can be combined by taking an eﬀective relative

shell thickness ∆r′/r ≃ ∆r/r + 0.5∆u/r. An essential result of our paper is that given the

current fabrication accuracies of ∆r′/r ∼ 5%, the loss length ℓ is limited to less than 50

lattice spacings a for frequencies that match the photonic gaps in high-index crystals.

Enhanced backscattering measurements have allowed us to determine the loss length ℓ

in synthetic opals, i.e., fcc crystals of close packed polystyrene spheres with n = 1.59 and

neﬀ = 1.45 [12]. In Figure 2(a), we plot ℓ for a wide normalized frequency range, obtained

with λ = 632, 685 and 780 nm, and many diﬀerent a. We see that ℓ decreases from 100a

for frequencies below ﬁrst order diﬀraction, to 5a at the highest frequencies. The observed

decrease of ℓ with a/λ conﬁrms the quadratic scaling predicted by our model and refutes the

Koenderink & Vos ‘Optical loss due to intrinsic structural variations of photonic ...’ 5

often assumed Rayleigh ω4 dependence [4, 13]. The degree of scattering is inconsistent with

the common assumption that scattering is due to point defects, e.g., missing spheres: From

the cross-section of a sphere [10] we ﬁnd that the observed scattering would require a density

of missing spheres worse than 0.13a−

3, inconsistent with the estimated density 0.01a−

3 [6,

13]. Another unlikely explanation for scattering loss are sphere-to-sphere variations of the

refractive index [14], which is over an order of magnitude weaker than the scattering evident

from Fig. 2(a).

In contrast, the magnitude of ℓ agrees well with scattering due to non-

uniformities and displacements of the spheres, assuming ∆r/r = 5% in Eq. (2). This value

agrees well with the cumulative eﬀect of polydispersity ∼ 2% and rms displacements of

spheres from their lattice sites (≤ 3.5% of the nearest neighbor distance), as independently

determined by small angle X-ray scattering [15].

We have carried out new experiments to probe losses in strongly interacting photonic crys-

tals, i.e., fcc inverse opals in a TiO2 backbone. While the magnitude of the non-uniformities

is similar to those in the opals [3], the inverse opals present a much larger index contrast

n = 2.7 ± 0.4 (neﬀ ≈ 1.18). We have determined ℓ from frequency-resolved total diﬀuse

transmission(T = ℓ/L, with L the sample thickness) using white-light FTIR spectroscopy

to cover a wide normalized frequency range for many samples with a = 650 nm to 930 nm.

As a function of a/λ, all total diﬀuse transmission spectra coincide up to a scaling factor

L/a. We have averaged the total transmission spectra (open symbols in Fig. 2(b)) for all

samples after compensating for this scaling. We calibrate the magnitude of ℓ using data

determined by enhanced backscattering [12] and with absolute values of ℓ from total trans-

mission (closed symbols). Figure 2(b) shows that ℓ decreases from 100a at a/λ = 0.4 to

only 4 lattice spacings at a/λ = 1.6. This decrease of ℓ is in excellent correspondence with

our prediction (solid curve), taking a non-uniformity ∆r/r = 4% that is consistent with

independent structural data [3].

To further test the validity of our model, we have analyzed transmission data reported in

many papers encompassing fcc and bcc crystals, with sphere volume fractions from ϕ = 0.7%

to 74% and index contrasts nhigh/nlow from 1.05 to 1.5 [13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Loss by

scattering causes the transmission outside stop gaps to decrease according to Lambert-Beer’s

law T = e−

L/ℓ. Table I shows that losses for a wide range of crystals agree with ∆r/r ≈ 5%,

consistent with typical sphere polydispersities and displacements of 2–5%. The relevance of

our model is furthermore conﬁrmed by examining the scaling of ℓ with frequency. We have

Koenderink & Vos ‘Optical loss due to intrinsic structural variations of photonic ...’ 6

ﬁtted a power law dependence ℓ ∝ ω−

x to each data set. In all cases we ﬁnd exponents

x < 4, except of course for the dilute crystal [18]. The ﬁtted exponents correspond well

to the frequency dependence of the calculated ℓ in the same frequency windows. Both the

quantitative agreement of ℓ with Eqs. (1,2) and the scaling with frequency conﬁrm that

polydispersity and displacements of unit cell building blocks determine the scattering loss

in 3D photonic crystals.

We now generalize the loss length to all photonic crystals. Figure 3 and Table I show

the universal behavior of the loss length at the frequency of the ﬁrst order stop gap as

a function of the photonic interaction strength. The loss length decreases strongly with

increased interaction strength, gauged by the relative width ∆ω/ω of the lowest gap. Indeed,

the generally pursued large gap widths require a large index contrast nhigh/nlow and are

thus associated with stronger scattering, due to the factor |m − 1|2 in Eq. (1). We have

calculated both ∆ω/ω and ℓ/a at the stop gap frequency as a function of the index contrast

in inverse opals (74% air) for several values of the non-uniformity ∆r/r. In Fig. 3, both the

experimental loss in Table I, and the calculated loss are plotted as a function of ∆ω/ω. A

surprisingly good agreement between the simple model with ∆r/r = 4% and all experimental

data is obtained. A photonic band gap requires ∆ω/ω > 15%; loss lengths less than 20

lattice spacings are expected at the current level of fabrication accuracy. Ultimately, one

hopes to realize photonic crystals that combine many optical functions. Recent technology

roadmaps foresee crystals containing ∼ 104 optical functions per mm2, requiring negligible

loss over more than mm distances (Ref.

[2], p. 245). From the general scaling of loss

with non-uniformity we conclude that applications of photonic band gap crystals in circuits

are a fata morgana, since a formidable tenfold increased perfection in statistical fabrication

accuracy to ∆r/r < 0.25% is required. Such an improvement is far beyond the current

state-of-the-art [1, 2].

Although 3D photonic crystals potentially oﬀer the best platform for photonic crystal

functionality, 2D photonic crystals posses many of the desired properties with the advantage

of ease of fabrication. While the fabrication methods are radically diﬀerent, 2D photonic

crystals suﬀer from similar polydispersity and displacements of their unit cell building blocks

as 3D crystals [8]. To obtain the scattering losses, we consider 2D crystals of inﬁnitely long

cylinders. In the range of cylinder radii relevant for 2D photonic crystals, the Rayleigh-Gans

silicon crystals pioneered by Gr¨uning et al. [22], we ﬁnd ℓ ∼ 40a for frequencies near lowest

order stop gaps, assuming a non-uniformity ∆r/r of 5%. A much larger ℓ is required for

integrated circuit applications. Unfortunately, calibrated transmission data or estimates of

the true non-uniformity are not yet available for these photonic crystals. In contrast, many

eﬀorts currently focus on quantifying losses in 2D crystals made from high index slabs on

lower index cladding layers, for which the nonuniformity ∆r/r is around 5% [1, 8]. Although

the guided wave proﬁle normal to the slab is not incorporated in our model, we believe that

Eq. (3) yields a reasonable estimate of losses due to nonuniformity of the air holes in such

structures. We conclude that applications of all 2D structures in photonic crystal integrated

circuits are next to impossible, since they also require a formidable increase in fabrication

accuracies beyond the current state-of-the-art [1, 2].

In addition to our microscopic description of loss due to disorder, several alternative

loss mechanisms in 2D slab crystals have been discussed. A heuristic model pioneered by

Benisty et al. [23] has shown that out-of-plane scattering losses occur even in hypothetical

perfectly manufactured 2D slab crystal designs, with loss lengths ℓ ∼ 50a comparable to

those due to structural variations. Many eﬀorts have since been devoted to reduce loss by

optimizing design parameters such as the average hole depth and average hole steepness [23].

The overall loss, however, is set by the added eﬀect of all these mechanisms. Prospects

for photonic crystal integrated circuits therefore appear bleak, unless both the challenges

of optimizing the average building block and of reducing the statistical variations in size

and position to sub-nanometer level are simultaneously met.

Importantly, the statistical

variations cannot be reduced by design optimization.

Variations in artiﬁcial structures such as photonic crystal diﬀer fundamentally from those

in atomic crystals, in which each building block is identical (∆r = 0). In addition, positional

variations in atomic crystals are dynamic, and can be vanishingly small at low tempera-

ture [7]. In other words, a real photonic crystal is quite diﬀerent from the ideal crystal of

solid-state theory. This manifests itself as prohibitive loss due to scattering from intrin-

sic non-uniformities of structural units, both for 2D and 3D photonic crystals. Unless the

Koenderink & Vos ‘Optical loss due to intrinsic structural variations of photonic ...’ 9

statistical imperfections of photonic crystals are considerably reduced, to sub-nanometer

precision, photonic crystal integrated circuits and similar applications have a dim future.

[9] Interference between scattering and photonic structure is of minor importance since (I) ex-

perimentally the loss length appears to be unaﬀected by photonic gaps, even when the gaps

severely conﬁne the propagation of light [12], (II) the loss length ℓ reﬂects loss averaged over

all allowed Bloch modes, which strongly reduces the importance of the Bloch mode proﬁles.

Thus we believe that the eﬀective medium model correctly captures the frequency dependence

of ℓ.

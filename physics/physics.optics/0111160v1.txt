We discuss curvature corrections to Fresnel’s laws for the reﬂection and transmission of light at a
non-planar refractive-index boundary. The reﬂection coeﬃcients are obtained from the resonances
of a dielectric disk within a sequential-reﬂection model. The Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect for curved light
fronts at a planar interface can be adapted to provide a qualitative and quantitative extension of
the ray model which explains the observed deviations from Fresnel’s laws.

The fabrication of lasing microresonators [1,2] and
opto-mechanical microdevices [3] has generated a surge
of interest in the conﬁnement and propagation of light
in small dielectric structures. Some understanding has
been achieved from the ray optics of these systems, com-
plemented by Fresnel’s laws of refraction and reﬂection
at the interfaces, e.g., in order to identify and describe
the relevant resonator modes [1,2]. Fresnel’s laws give the
probability of reﬂection and refraction of plane electro-
magnetic waves at planar interfaces of media with diﬀer-
ent refractive index n. Microresonators, however, often
are so small that the curvature of their boundary cannot
be neglected.

In this paper we investigate,

in the limit of large
wavenumbers, the corrections to the Fresnel coeﬃcients
which appear due to the curvature of the dielectric in-
terface. The reﬂection coeﬃcients are obtained via a
sequential-reﬂection model [4] from the resonance widths
of a microresonator, which are analytically accessible for
large wavenumbers. The deviations from Fresnel’s laws
are most noticeable around the critical angle for total
internal reﬂection, χc = arcsin(1/n) (where the refrac-
tive index of the surrounding medium is set to unity)
and amount in a systematic reduction of the reﬂection
probability.

The reduction of the reﬂection probability is conven-
tionally related to tunneling escape at the curved inter-
face. In view of the previous success of the ray model,
which often is desired to be retained for its simplicity, we
provide an alternative qualitative and quantitative expla-
nation of the deviations by incorporating into this model
the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect [5–10]. This eﬀect results from
the interference of rays in a beam with slight variations
of the angle of incidence and consists of a shift of the ef-
fective plane of reﬂection. At a curved interface, it turns
out that the reﬂection probability is then reduced be-
cause the angle of incidence at the eﬀective interface is
smaller than at the physical interface.

There is evidence obtained in the context of quantum-
mechanical scattering problems [11] that incorporating
the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect is equivalent to a semiclassical
approximation. Also the eﬀect has been used in Ref. [12]
to explain the decreased spacing of resonances observed

in experiments with dielectric spheres, in terms of an
eﬀective optical size of the cavity which is larger than its
physical size. Our work can be seen as complementary to
this previous study, because we are concerned with the
resonance widths, not only the resonance energies.

Curvature corrections to Fresnel coeﬃcients have been
addressed in the past in a number of works, by applying
various techniques; see for example Refs. [13–16]. The
works closest in spirit to the present paper are those
which employ the complex ray method, e.g., to describe
light rays approaching a disk from outside [15,16].

Although we restrict our discussion to circular inter-
faces, the results for the reﬂection coeﬃcients should be
applicable to microresonators of general shape as soon as
locally the curvature can be approximated as a constant.
According to Fresnel’s laws, a plane electromagnetic
wave incident on a planar dielectric interface with an-
gle of incidence χ is reﬂected with the polarization-
dependent coeﬃcients

RTM =

sin2(χ − η)
sin2(χ + η)

, RTE =

tan2(χ − η)
tan2(χ + η)

,

(1)

where TM (TE) signiﬁes transverse polarization of the
magnetic (electric) ﬁeld at the interface and η =
arcsin(n sin χ) is the direction of the refracted beam (ac-
cording to Snell’s law).

Let us compare the Fresnel coeﬃcients with the reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcients at a curved interface with radius of cur-
vature rc. Their angular dependence can be conveniently
obtained from the energies and widths of resonance states
in a two-dimensional circular disk of radius rc. In this ge-
ometry the two possible polarization directions decouple
and angular momentum (quantum number m) is con-
served. We introduce polar coordinates r and φ and de-
note the (complex) wavenumber by k. We will concen-
trate on the case close to geometric optics Re krc ≫ 1.

The resonance states are obtained by matching the
wave ﬁeld ∝ Jm(nkr)eimφ inside the disk (with the Bessel
function J) at r = rc to the wave ﬁeld ∝ H (1)
m (kr)eimφ
outside the disk (with the Hankel function H (1)), where
the matching conditions follow from Maxwell’s equations:

in the TE case (primes denote derivatives). Given a com-
plex solution k, the angle of incidence is obtained from
the real part by comparing the angular momentum in the
ray picture and in the wave picture,

sin χ =

while the reﬂection probability

R = exp(4n Im krc cos χ)

(4)

(5)

follows from the imaginary part of k because it deter-
mines the escape rate, which in turn can be related to R
by the sequential-reﬂection model [4].

Because the discrete set of resonance energies obtained
from Eqs. (2) and (3) only is meaningful for the disk, let
us ﬁrst derive analytical expressions for the resonance
width as a function of a continuous resonance energy
which smoothly interpolate between these solutions. It
is interesting to note [4] that one cannot simply expand
Eqs. (2), (3) in Im k when k is not close to an exact solu-
tion. Moreover, for TE polarization Im k would diverge
at the Brewster angle if it is calculated by inserting the
Fresnel coeﬃcient (1) into Eq. (5). In order to achieve a
more accurate expansion we separate out the problematic
term and cast Eqs. (2) and (3) into the form

slowly varying complex function of its argument, and the
argument can be taken real because Re k ≫ |Im k|. The
logarithmic derivative of Bessel functions, however, is a
rapidly ﬂuctuating function, and its dependence on Im k
has to be worked out carefully. This can be achieved by
approximation by tangents [17],

Figures 2 and 3 show the result for the two values
Re krc = 50 and Re krc = 150, respectively. Deviations
from Fresnel’s laws (1) are most visible around the critical
angle χc = arcsin(1/n) where the reﬂection coeﬃcients
increase rapidly as the regime of total internal reﬂec-
tion is approached. The correction consists not only in
a broadening of the transition interval, but most notably
also in a shift of this transition region towards higher an-
gles of incidence, resulting in a systematic reduction of
the reﬂection coeﬃcient.

The deviations from Fresnel’s laws in Figs. 2 and 3
increase as Re krc is reduced, that is, the more notice-
able the curvature of the interface is. On the other

FIG. 2. Reﬂection coeﬃcients R in a dielectric disk with
Re krc = 50. The solid curve is the analytical result (12),
which smoothly interpolates between the exact solutions of
Eqs. (2), (3) with real part close to 50 [squares, translated
into angular-dependent reﬂection coeﬃcients by Eqs. (4) and
(5)]. The dashed curve is the result of incorporating the
Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect into a ray model (assuming for TE po-
larization that the shift is the same as for TM polarization, for
reasons explained in the text). The dotted curve is Fresnel’s
law (1).

hand, in the zero-wavelength limit Re krc → ∞ of ge-
ometric optics any interface appears planar, and Fres-
nel’s laws should apply without modiﬁcation.
Indeed
it can be seen that they are recovered from Eq. (12)
when the approximation by tangents is also applied to
the Hankel functions in F , resulting in F TM = in−1 cos η,
F TE = in cos η. The deviations close to the critical angle
are directly related to the break-down of this approxi-
mation when the argument of the Hankel functions be-
comes smaller than the index. As we will discuss now,
the curvature corrections to Fresnel’s coeﬃcients can be
obtained within a minimal extension of the ray picture
when the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect is taken into account (the
result obtained is given by the dashed curves in Figs. 2
and 3).

The Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect [5–10] refers to the displace-
ment of the reﬂected beam when the incident beam con-
sists of rays with slight variations of the angle of inci-
dence, and arises because each ray experiences a slightly
diﬀerent phase shift when it is reﬂected. As is illustrated
in Fig. 4a, the lateral shift along the interface also can be
interpreted as resulting from a displacement of the eﬀec-
tive plane of reﬂection (a signature of this displacement

The result based on the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect is almost indis-

is the increased Wigner delay time which recently has
been measured at metallic gratings [18].)

Since at a planar interface the reﬂection law is not af-
fected by parallel displacement and fulﬁlled for the mean
angles of incidence, the reﬂection coeﬃcients are not af-
fected by the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect—the only consequence
of the slight variation of angles is that their angular de-
pendence is smeared out. However, the situation changes
at a curved interface [11] as shown in Fig. 4b. The inter-
section of the incident and the laterally shifted reﬂected
ray deﬁnes an eﬀective boundary of radius r′
c > rc. We
now can assume that the ray is specularly reﬂected at the
eﬀective boundary, resulting in a smaller eﬀective angle of
incidence χ′ < χ, and evaluate the Fresnel reﬂection co-
eﬃcients (1) at this smaller angle χ′. Since the reﬂection
probability is then reduced this qualitatively explains the
observed deviations from Fresnel’s laws in Figs. 2 and 3.
For a quantitative comparison we need the distribution
of angles of incidence P (χ), which can be related to the
radial width ∝ rc(nRe krc)−2/3 of the caustic in the ra-
dial wave ﬁeld Jm(nkr). (The same distribution of angles
will also be used to smooth out the reﬂection coeﬃcients
as is appropriate even for the planar interface.) The vari-
ation of angles of incidence arises from the intrinsic cur-
vature of the beam wave front and also directly from the
curvature of the interface—note that both mechanisms
should contribute equally to the Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect.

FIG. 4. (a) Goos-H¨anchen shift at a planar interface. An
incident beam containing contributions from plane waves of
slightly diﬀerent angle of incidence χ appears to be reﬂected
at a position that is shifted a distance zGH away from the
point of incidence. Alternatively, one can think of the beam
to be reﬂected at a shifted interface indicated by the dashed
lines.
(b) Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect at a curved interface. The
reﬂection seems to occur at an interface of larger curvature
radius r′

c > rc under a smaller angle χ′ < χ of incidence.

We found that for our purposes P (χ) is suﬃciently well
approximated by that of a Gaussian beam of half width
σ = rc(nRe krc)−2/3 ≪ rc. It is good to observe that this
Gaussian beam geometry does not put us into conﬂict
with the ﬁnite disk size while at the same time leaving us
in the paraxial regime nRe kσ = (nRe krc)1/3 ≫ 1. For
TM polarization the eﬀective radius of curvature r′
c can
then be calculated by applying the formulas of Ref. [7]
(which are lengthy expressions and hence not given here).
The result of this Goos-H¨anchen-eﬀect-based approach
is presented as the dashed curves in the upper panels of
Figs. 2 and 3. There is good agreement with the exact
results obtained within the sequential-reﬂection model.
For TE polarization and the chosen refractive index, the
analytic results in the literature becomes applicable only
for Re krc >
∼ 1000. Surprisingly (see however Ref. [19]),
in the current situation nice agreement is found by sim-
ply assuming that the Goos-H¨anchen shift is identical
to the TM case, as is indicated by the dashed curves in
the lower panels of Figs. 2 and 3. (For Re krc >
∼ 1000,
however, it is appropriate to work with the correct TE
formulas.)

In conclusion, we investigated the reﬂection coeﬃ-
cients at a curved refractive index boundary by relat-
ing them to resonances in a circular dielectric disk and
derived analytic expressions valid in the limit of large
wavenumbers. The deviations from Fresnel’s laws can be

4

explained within geometric optics by incorporating the
Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect. In this work we concentrated on
the wave ﬁeld conﬁned by reﬂection inside the microcav-
ity. The Goos-H¨anchen shift also aﬀects the wave ﬁeld
outside the cavity [11,16,20], because the modiﬁed angle
of incidence results in a change of the angle of refraction.
It is desirable to investigate the implications on the re-
markable emission directionality of non-circular devices
[1,2], which sometimes departs substantially from what
is expected from geometric optics [21].

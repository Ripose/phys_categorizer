The reorientational nonlinearity of nematic liquid crystals enables a self-localized spatial soliton
and its waveguide to be deﬂected or destroyed by a control beam propagating across the cell. We
demonstrate a simple all-optical readdressing scheme by exploiting the lens-like perturbation induced
by an external beam on both a nematicon and a co-polarized guided signal of diﬀerent wavelength.
Angular steering as large as 2.2 degrees was obtained for control powers as low as 32mW in the near
infrared.

Optical spatial solitons, i.e. self-localized light beams
in nonlinear media, are excellent building blocks for all-
optical signal processing. In Kerr-like media with a self-
focusing response, spatial solitons can also conﬁne a sig-
nal which propagates un-diﬀracted in the corresponding
waveguide.1,2,3,4 Owing to their “particle-like behavior”,
spatial solitons have been exploited in several conﬁgura-
tions and materials for optical signal readdressing, logic
gating and switching.1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

In most conﬁgurations, however, spatial solitons were
required to interact with other solitons or beams over
propagation lengths orders of magnitude larger than their
transverse size. Recently, the highly non local and non-
resonant molecular response of undoped nematic liquid
crystals (NLC) has enabled the demonstration of stable
(2+1)-dimensional spatial solitons (or nematicon12) and
their interactions at mW power levels.12,13,14,15,16 In this
Letter, based on the large molecular nonlinearity of NLC
(several orders of magnitude higher than in CS2),17,18
we demonstrate all-optical readdressing of spatial soli-
tons via the lens-like perturbation induced by an external
beam propagating across the medium.

NLC consist of anisotropic rod-like molecules which
tend to be aligned in a speciﬁc direction owing to
intermolecular forces, anchoring at the interfaces, an
electrostatic (or in general low-frequency) or magneto-
static bias.19 Fig.
1(a) shows a typical cell arrange-
ment in the presence of an external voltage to pre-tilt
the molecules and facilitate their all-optical response.13
An extraordinary-polarized light beam can reorient the
molecules towards the ﬁeld vector due to (induced) dipo-
lar reaction. Such reorientation results in a self-focusing
nonlinearity (an extraordinary index increase) because of
the medium birefringence; this response is also non local
because of the elastic forces binding the molecules to one
another.15 When diﬀraction is balanced by nonlinearity,
a nematicon is obtained: its own graded-index waveguide
also able to guide a co-polarized (weak) signal even at a
diﬀerent wavelength (see Fig. 1(b)).12

An external z -polarized (control) beam propagating
through the NLC cell can also induce an index pertur-
bation owing to reorientation (see sketch in Fig. 1 (a)
and (c)). Such perturbation can overlap the refractive
distribution due to the voltage bias and the nematicon,

an x-polarized weak signal (35µW at 633nm) is conﬁned in

the perturbation can be evaluated by considering both

conditions corresponding to our experimental arrange-
ment were θ(0,y,z )=θ(h,y,z )=2◦, a bias V =1.4V, a Gaus-
sian control beam of given waist w c and power Pc. Figure
2(a) shows the refractive distribution due to the exter-
nal voltage V and experienced by a z -propagating wave
polarized in the xz (principal) plane, i.e. corresponding
to or guided by a nematicon). Figs. 2(b-c) display the
eﬀect of a control beam (of waist 8µm and power 32mW)
which, owing to its polarization, tends to reduce θ and
determine a diverging (defocusing) lens-like perturbation
with a negative index peak of 0.049. When a spatial soli-
ton is excited, therefore, this negative lens close to or
on its path is expected to interfere with its propagation,
destroying or deviating it according to their relative posi-
tion. The same considerations apply to the co-polarized
signal eventually guided by the nematicon.

In the experiments we employed a sample with the ne-
matic E7 and the parameters speciﬁed above. The planar
cell, realized in glass (see Fig. 1(a)), was equipped with
Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) electrodes for the application of
a bias. The setup consisted of a Nd:YAG pump collinear
with a He-Ne probe and injected into the cell (along z )
in the extraordinary polarization to excite a nematicon.
A λ=1064nm z -polarized control beam was focused in
the NLC as it propagated across the cell thickness (along
x ). The control spot could be precisely positioned with
respect to the soliton trajectory in the yz plane. In the
absence of the control beam, typical results for a 35µW
probe co-launched and co-polarized with the 1.064µm
pump are displayed in Fig. 1(b). When a nematicon
was generated for input powers as low as 2.2mW and
V =1.4V, the weak signal propagated undiﬀracted as a
guided mode on the nonlinear waveguide for propagation
distances well exceeding the Rayleigh length.12

When the control beam was turned on and focused
nearby the nematicon we could observe two main phe-
nomena, as shown in Fig. 3. When the nonlinear lens
was formed on the soliton trajectory, the latter split up
into two symmetrically displaced arms, thereby forming
a Y junction. The guided He-Ne probe underwent the
same behavior, as visible in Fig. 3(a). Noticeably, the
two beams after the Y-stem were self-localized or diﬀract-

ing depending on the amount of power associated to the
nematicon, in substantial agreement with the behavior
predicted for the interaction of spatial solitons with lo-
calized inhomogeneities.20 As the perturbing lens was
shifted along y, the soliton and its signal were steered to-
wards the higher index region, bending in the half plane
(yz ) not containing the external beam. Fig. 3(b) shows
such a case corresponding to P c=32mW and a y-shift
of 9µm. In our geometry the latter value maximized d
the sought steering for powers never exceeding 32mW,
i.e. low enough not to induce thermal eﬀects. We could
ascertain the negative sign of the induced nonlinear in-
dex change based on standard analysis of the diﬀraction
ring-like patterns induced by a light beam traversing an
NLC layer,17,21 whereas its reorientational nature was
conﬁrmed by time-resolved pump-probe experiments, the
turn-on time being much faster for a thermally-induced
response.
Fig. 4 graphs various nematicon trajectories as the con-
trol power was varied. In each curve, noise and slight os-
cillations are due to thermal ﬂuctuations of the medium
as well as dis-uniformities in the cell. Finally, Fig. 5 plots
the steering angle (with respect to the unperturbed case)
versus P c: a maximum deﬂection of 2.2◦ was achieved for
P c=32mW.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated all-optical rout-
ing based on the nonlinear interaction between orthog-
onally propagating beams in nematic liquid crystals. A
nematicon and the signal it conﬁned could be deviated
using the negative lens-like perturbation induced by a
control beam. The externally induced GRIN did not
appreciably aﬀect the guiding properties of the soliton,
solely intervening on its trajectory except for the head-on
geometry (Fig. 3(a)).

the one exploited in this work.12

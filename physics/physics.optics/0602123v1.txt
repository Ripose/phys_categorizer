Abstract

The resonant buildup of light within optical microcavities elevates the radiation pressure which

mediates coupling of optical modes to the mechanical modes of a microcavity. Above a certain

threshold pump power, regenerative mechanical oscillation occurs causing oscillation of certain

mechanical eigenmodes. Here, we present a methodology to spatially image the micro-mechanical

resonances of a toroid microcavity using a scanning probe technique. The method relies on record-

ing the induced frequency shift of the mechanical eigenmode when in contact with a scanning probe

tip. The method is passive in nature and achieves a sensitivity suﬃcient to spatially resolve the vi-

brational mode pattern associated with the thermally agitated displacement at room temperature.

The recorded mechanical mode patterns are in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical

strain ﬁelds as obtained by ﬁnite element simulations.

The work of V.B. Braginsky[1] predicted that due to radiation pressure the mechani-

cal mirror-eigenmodes of a Fabry-P´erot (FP) resonator can couple to the optical modes,

leading to a parametric oscillation instability. This phenomenon is characterized by regen-

erative mechanical oscillation of the mechanical cavity eigen-modes. Signiﬁcant theoretical

studies have been devoted to this eﬀect in the context of the laser gravitational wave obser-

vatory (LIGO) ([1, 2]), as it potentially impedes gravitational wave detection. Whereas in

macroscopic resonators the inﬂuence of radiation pressure is weak and only appreciable at

high power levels[3], the mutual coupling of optical and mechanical modes is signiﬁcantly

enhanced in optical microcavities (such as silica microspheres[4], microdisks or toroids[5])

which simultaneously exhibit ultra-high-Q optical modes and high-Q mechanical modes in

the radio-frequency range. The combination of high optical power and small mechanical

mass and dissipation leads to threshold levels in the micro-Watt regime for regenerative

acoustic oscillations (i.e. parametric oscillation instability), making it the dominant micro-

cavity nonlinear optical eﬀect as reported previously in toroid microcavities[6, 7, 8].

In this letter, we report a novel scanning-probe technique, which allows direct spatial

imaging of the amplitude of the micro-mechanical modes of a microcavity associated with

their thermally driven displacement at room temperature. The method is based on the

induced resonance shift by a scanning probe tip, whose inﬂuence on the mechanical oscilla-

tor’s resonance frequency is detected optically via the light transmitted past the microcavity.

This technique is passive in nature, and reaches a sensitivity which is suﬃcient to detect the

minute amplitude of the thermally driven mechanical modes. Initial demonstrations of this

method show very good agreement between the mechanical mode distribution obtained by

scanning-probe spectroscopy and ﬁnite-element modeling. Besides providing insight into the

spatial pattern of the mechanical modes of an optical microcavity, this technique should pro-

vide a useful tool for the study of other micromechanical or nano-mechanical resonators[9].

The experimental scenario is depicted schematically in Figure 1. It consists of a standard

geometry in which a pump wave is coupled from a waveguide (a tapered optical ﬁber[10])

to an ultra-high-Q microcavity mode of a toroid microcavity on a chip [5]. In addition to

their excellent optical properties, this microcavity geometry - owing to its free hanging silica

membrane supporting the toroidal periphery - possesses high-Q micromechanical resonances.

The inset in ﬁgure 3 shows the ﬁrst two (n = 1, 2) mechanical modes of the structure,

calculated using ﬁnite element modeling. The modes are rotationally symmetric (i.e. their

2

azimuthal mode number being m = 0). As evident from the ﬁnite element simulation, the

motion of the ﬁrst and second order ﬂexural mode is primarily in the out-of plane direction

(of the toroid and disk).

On resonance the high buildup of light within the cavity leads to an increase in radiation

pressure, expanding the cavity (optical round trip) and thereby coupling the optical mode to

the mechanical eigenmodes of the cavity as described in Refs[6, 7, 8]. The mutual coupling

of the mechanical and optical mode is described by the following set of equations:

is the cavity round-trip time), which is excited with a pump laser detuned

by the amount ∆ω from line-center. The expressions Kom and Kmo describe the mutual

coupling of optical and mechanical eigen-modes, and depend on the respective modes. The

coupling can be mapped to a Fabry-P´erot cavity, by considering the modes as a harmonic

oscillator with in plane (radial amplitude r, which modulates the cavity pathlength) and

out-of plane motion (amplitude z). Solving equations (1)-(2) shows that the radiation pres-

sure causes the mechanical oscillator to experience: (1) a change in rigidity; (2) the addition

of a velocity dependent term (providing either a viscous force or an accelerating force), i.e.

The approximate solutions are (for ωm ≪ ω0/Q): ∆βL = τ dF

the laser being detuned to the blue with respect to the cavity resonance (∆βL > 0) leads

dx and ∆kL = dF

to mechanical gain. If the mechanical gain exceeds the mechanical loss, a parametric oscil-

lation instability can be observed in which regenerative mechanical oscillations occur. This

phenomenon has been observed for the ﬁrst time recently in toroid microcavities and has

been extensively characterized[6, 7, 8].

Here we investigate the interaction of a local probe (whose dimensions are small compared

to the optical microcavity) with the mechanical modes, and demonstrate a novel method

which can spatially resolve the mechanical mode pattern associated with the thermally

agitated displacement of the toroid microcavities. In order to spatially image the mechanical

modes a scanning probe is introduced as shown in Figure 1 which contacts the free hanging

disk connected to the toroidal cavity and supported by the silicon pillar. The scanning

probe setup consisted of a silica tapered ﬁber tip controlled by a piezoelectric stage (with

80 nm resolution). The tip of the scanning probe was fabricated by CO2 laser melting and

stretching of a single mode ﬁber, and had a tip-diameter ca. 3 µm. The probe was lowered

onto the silica support disk (i.e. the interior region of the toroidal microcavity), while the

taper was simultaneously coupled to the toroid. Figure 1 a,c shows an optical micrograph

of the taper-cavity system in contact with the probe (top view, side view respectively). The

presence of the probe couples the mechanical microcavity mode to the acoustical modes of

the probe. This coupling has two eﬀects; (1) the mechanical quality (Qm) factor of the

microcavity structure is reduced; and (2) the mechanical eigenfrequency (ωm) is changed,

due to a change in rigidity[9]. We note the similarity of this method to the ”AC” mode of

an atomic force microscope[11, 12] , which uses the change in mechanical frequency of an

oscillating cantilever to record the topology of the surface (induced by position dependent

forces due to the presence of near-ﬁeld forces). However, in the present case, not the resonant

frequency shift of the probe is monitored, but rather the resonant frequency and Q of the

micromechanical resonator itself. As the mechanical cavity-motion modulates the optical

power coupled to the cavity (i.e., cavity transmission) and thereby creates sidebands at

ω = ω ± ωm in the transmitted optical spectrum, the mechanical oscillation frequency and

Q-factor can be readily measured via the transmitted pump power past the cavity.

If the optical pump power is low (compared to the threshold for mechanical oscillations

to occur) then the optical ﬁeld acts purely as a probe of the mechanical oscillation and

does not modify the mechanical properties of the structure (i.e. the light will not excite
mechanical resonances, since P ≪ Pthresh equivalent to ∆βL ≪ ωm
Qm
mechanical oscillation can be increased rapidly (and the regime P ≪ Pthresh achieved),

). The threshold for

when biasing the coupling junction into the overcoupled regime[13], owing to the fact that

threshold scales inverse cubically with the optical Q factor (in cases where the mechanical

frequency is smaller than the cavity bandwidth[6, 7]). Therefore the system can be described

In this regime (P ≪ Pthresh), the oscillator is only thermally driven (i.e. the energy being

equal to kbT ), causing modulation of the ﬁeld stored inside the cavity, due to the change in

cavity path-length. The solutions in this regime to the above equation are given by:

The appearance of sidebands (at ωm and harmonics) is thus observable at the mechanical

eigen-frequencies with a modulation depth M which is governed by the speciﬁcs of the

coupling mechanism and the amplitude of the motion, i.e. M = Kmo · xT , where xT is the

thermal displacement noise, as given by xT =

of the optical probe ﬁeld is increased above the ambient temperature of 300 K by several

degrees, due to absorption of photons and subsequent heating (as evidenced from thermal

hysteresis)[14]. Detection of light transmitted past the microcavity exhibits modulation

components at ωm and harmonics, as the transmitted light past the tapered ﬁber interferes

with the modulated ﬁeld emerging from the cavity, i.e.

sion is maximum. By spectral decomposition of the cavity transmission (T ), the mechanical

resonance frequency and mechanical Q-factor can therefore be recorded. The inset of Fig-

ure 2 shows the lorentzian lineshape of the ﬁrst ﬂexural mode as well as a theoretical ﬁt

(solid line). Therefore, the transmitted pump light can be used to optically probe both the

micromechanical resonant frequency, as well as the mechanical Q factor.

Having established a detection technique for the mechanical resonant characteristics (ωm,

Qm) static probe contact measurements were carried out. When the probe is brought in

contact with the silica disk, a reduction of the mechanical Q factor is observed, as the

5

probe constitutes a dissipative loss channel to the mechanical oscillator. The reduction

of Q factor increases with contact pressure of the probe.

In addition, we note that the

observed decrease in Q is concomitant with an increase in mechanical eigenfrequency. Figure

2 shows Qm as a function of frequency ωm. As can be seen, a linear relationship between
mechanical loss (∝ Q−1

m ) and induced frequency shift (∆ωm) is obtained. This is non-

intuitive at ﬁrst sight, and not in agreement with a damped harmonic oscillator model,

which predicts that the increase in damping (e.g. due to the tip) causes a red-shift of the
resonance frequency, i.e. ω′ = ω

Q2 . However, the presence of the tip causes not only a
change in dissipation but also a change in the rigidity of the oscillator (∆kP ) which causes a

1 − 4

q

blue-shift by ∆ω∆k = ωm

−∆k
2k . This eﬀect is well known for cantilevers used for atomic force
microscopy [11, 12, 15]. This empirical linear relationship of Qm and ∆ωm was recorded for

diﬀerent modes (1,2,3) and found repeatedly for all measurements reported in this letter.

Next spatial probing was carried out, and the inﬂuence of the mechanical resonant char-

acteristics (ωm, Qm) on the spatial probe position analyzed. Figure 3 shows the results of

this measurement in which scanning is performed along the entire cross section of a toroidal

cavity with a diameter of 104 µm (the resonant frequencies for the n = 1 and n = 2 modes

were 6.07 MHz and 14.97 MHz). The cavity was fabricated with a strong undercut, in order

to promote the recorded amplitudes (the thermal displacement was approximately xT ≈ 1

pm for the n = 1 mode). As can be observed in Fig. 3 (upper graph) for the n = 1 mode

(which in its unperturbed state has a resonant frequency of 6.07 MHz) a continuous de-

crease, followed by a plateau and then followed by an increase in the mechanical frequencies

was observed while scanning from the one outer edge of the toroid to the opposing edge

(The frequency range covered the unperturbed value of 6.07 MHz to 6.17 MHz, equating
to a fractional change of ∆ωm
ωm

≈ 0.016). Similarly the mechanical Q-factor was continually

reduced, plateaud in the interior region, followed again by an increase. The data in Fig.

3 represents the recorded frequency shift normalized to unity. This is a ﬁrst indication,

that the induced frequency shifts and Q-factor change depend critically on the amplitude

of the mechanical oscillations, and therefore probe local information about the mechanical

amplitude. To conﬁrm that this eﬀect is not topological in nature (e.g. due to an irregular

shape of the interior silica disk surface), and in order to establish that the recorded shift in

frequency is indeed a measure of the mechanical amplitude, thedependencies for the n = 2

mode were measured. The result for the n = 2 mode is shown in Fig. 3b, and is clearly

6

distinct from the n = 1 mode. These measurements were obtained repeatedly on diﬀerent

samples, with diﬀerent tips. As evident the mechanical frequency is perturbed maximally

at the point of maximum mechanical amplitude and decreases to zero in the interior of the

toroid, as well as at the outer edge. This clearly indicates that the observed frequency shift

is not related to the surface-topology, but in fact provides direct information on the local

mechanical oscillation amplitude. In order to make a qualitative comparison of the recorded

frequency shift and the actual mechanical motion, the numerically calculated amplitude (

in the z-direction) is superimposed in ﬁgure 3. The calculations employed ﬁnite element

modeling of the actual geometry (as inferred by SEM). The theoretically modeled ampli-

tudes were scaled to unity in the vertical direction. We note that the position of maximum

amplitude of the n = 1 and n = 2 mode, agrees very well with the ﬁnite element simulation

as does the overall shape of the curves.While a detailed understanding of how the probe

changes the resonant characteristics of the oscillator is at present lacking, the data along

with the modeling strongly suggests that the recorded frequency shifts do directly relate to

the strain ﬁelds in the z-direction. Note that deviation of the recorded shift with the numer-

ical modeling is expected, due to the convolution of the ﬁnite probe size (in the experiments

this is approximately 3 µm) with the mechanical motion.

In summary a novel method is presented which allows direct probing of the vibrational

mode patterns of a micromechanical oscillator. The method relies on spatially recording the

induced frequency shift by a scanning probe tip, and exhibits suﬃcient sensitivity to detect

the mode pattern of thermally excited acoustic modes. The present results should also be

applicable to other types of micromechanical oscillators, and could provide a useful tool in

the ﬁeld of MEMS/NEMS[9], as well as to achieve tuning of mechanical resonator modes[9],.

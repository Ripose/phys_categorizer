We study the beam reﬂection from a layered structure with a left-handed metamaterial. We
predict a giant lateral (Goos-H¨anchen) shift and splitting of the beam due to the resonant excitation
of surface polaritons with a vortex-like energy ﬂow between the right- and left-handed materials.

As is known, a totally reﬂected beam experiences a lat-
eral displacement from its position predicted by the geo-
metric optics because each of its plane-wave components
undergoes a diﬀerent phase change [1]. For the beam
reﬂected from an interface, the lateral beam shift (the
so-called Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect) is usually much less than
the beam width. However, larger beam shifts may occur
in the layered systems supporting surface waves, which
are able to transfer energy along the interface. Such sur-
face waves are not excited at a single interface because
the phase-matching condition between the incident and
surface waves are not satisﬁed. However, a surface po-
lariton can be excited in a layered structure, when the
beam is incident at the angle larger than the angle of
the total internal reﬂection. Excitations of polaritons
take place in two well known geometries of the attenu-
ated beam reﬂection (used e.g. for the measurements of
the dielectric permittivity of solids): (i) glass prism-air-
silver structure (the so-called Otto conﬁguration) and (ii)
prism-silver ﬁlm-air structure (the so-called Kretchmann
conﬁguration) (see, e.g., Ref. [2] and references therein).

The extensive study of novel microstructured mate-
rials with negative refraction recently fabricated exper-
imentally [3], the so-called left-handed metamaterials,
demonstrates that an interface between right- and left-
handed material supports surface polaritons of TE and
TM types [4, 5], which can enhance dramatically the
Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect because surface waves can transfer
the energy along the interface. In this Letter, we predict
and analize the giant Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect in the struc-
ture (i) (the Otto conﬁguration), where the third medium
is substituted by a left-handed metamaterial.

We consider a two-dimensional geometry shown in
Fig. 1(a), where the beam, incident from an optically
dense medium (ǫ1µ1 > ǫ2µ2) at the angle larger than
the angle of the total internal reﬂection, is reﬂected from
the interface. We assume that the third medium is sepa-
rated by a gap (which we call the second medium), and
it is made of a left-handed metamaterial which possesses
both negative real parts of dielectric permittivity ǫ3 and
magnetic permeability µ3. The interface between the sec-
ond and third media supports surface waves which can
be excited resonantly when the tangential component of
the wave vector of the incident beam coincides with the

propagation constant of the surface polariton.

a case, the surface wave can transfer energy along the
interface leading to a great enhancement of the lateral
beam shift.

The Goos-H¨anchen shift ∆ can be calculated analyt-
ically as ∆ = −dΦ/dkx [6], when the phase Φ of the
reﬂection coeﬃcient is a linear function of the wave vec-
tor component kx along the interface, across the spectral
width of the beam. The (standard) lateral beam shift
has been calculated for the reﬂection from layered struc-
tures with left-handed materials, for the cases of a single
interface [7] and for a periodic structure of alternating
right- and left-handed layers [8].

In our geometry [see Fig. 1(a)], the reﬂection coeﬃcient
R = R(kx) for the TE-polarized plane monochromatic
[∼ exp (iωt)] wave can be found as

R =

(α1 + 1)(α2 + 1) − (α1 − 1)(α2 − 1)e2ik2d
(α1 − 1)(α2 + 1) − (α1 + 1)(α2 − 1)e2ik2d ,

where α1,2 = kz1,3µ2/kz2µ1,3, kzi = (ω2ǫiµi/c2 − k2
x)1/2,
where i = 1, 2, 3, d is the gap thickness, and c is the speed
of light in vacuum. Here, we consider the TE polarized
waves, but the results are qualitatively similar for the
TM polarized waves.

We consider an incident beam of the Gaussian shape,
Ei(x) = exp (−x2/4a2 − ikx0x), where a is the width of
the beam, kx0 determines the angle of incidence φ, kx0 =
k1 sin φ, and k1 is the propagation constant in the ﬁst
medium, k1 = ω
(ǫ1µ1)/c. The reﬂected ﬁeld is found
in a standard way

where ¯Ei is the Fourier spectrum of the incident beam.
Larger lateral beam shifts are expected at the angles
of incidence such that the beam spectrum contains the
components with the same kx as the propagation con-
stant of the surface waves. As has been shown recently,
both forward and backward surface polaritons can exist
at the left-handed interface [5], depending on the param-
eters X = |ǫ3|/ǫ2 and Y = |µ3|/µ2. Excitation of the
forward surface waves results in the energy transfer in
the direction of incidence. A negative shift of the beam
is obtained when the backward surface waves are excited,
this corresponds to the parameters XY > 1 and Y < 1.

The values ∆ ≪ 1 correspond to the beam shift much
smaller then the beam width, while ∆ ≥ 1 corresponds
to a giant Goos-H¨anchen shift. The second momentum
∆2 characterizes a change of the beam width during the

We chose the following parameters of the media: ǫ1 =
12.8, µ1 = ǫ2 = µ2 = 1, ǫ3 = −3, µ3 = −0.5. The propa-
gation constant of surface polaritons can be found from
the relation h2 = (ω/c)2ǫ2µ2Y (Y − X)/(Y 2 − 1), and for
these parameters the surface waves at the interface are
backward propagating. Figures 1(b,c) show the depen-
dence of ∆ and W on the angle of incidence at ωa/c = 100
and ωd/c = 3, respectively. We observe a distinctive res-
onant dependence of the beam shift, and the maximum
corresponds to the phase matching condition kx0 = h.

In the inset (2) of Fig. 1(c), two distinctive peaks in
the reﬂected beam are observed. The ﬁrst peak corre-
sponds to a mirror reﬂection, while the second peak is
shifted from the incident beam and it appears due to the
excitation of surface waves. At the resonance, the lateral
beam shift becomes larger than the beam width. The

double-peak structure appears only for narrow beams,
when the beam spectrum is wider than the spectrum
width of the surface mode, the later can be found as
a width of the resonance shown in Fig. 1(b). The com-
ponents of the beam spectrum outside this region are re-
ﬂected in a mirror-like fashion, while the spectrum com-
ponents near the resonance transform into a surface wave,
being responcible for the second peak in the shifted re-
ﬂected beam. For wider beams, such that their spectrum
is completely falls into the surface mode excitation line,
only the shifted peak appears. With an increase of the
beam width, though, the relative beam shift decreases
due to the fact that the absolute shift of the beam grows
slower than the beam width.

Figures 2(a-c) show the beam shift and width vs. the
normalized gap thickness and the structure of the energy
ﬂow. The resonances observed in Figs. 2(a,b) have sim-
ple physical explanation. Indeed, when the gap is absent
(d = 0) or small, no surface wave is excited, and the beam
shift is negligible. Increasing the gap width, one increases
the quality factor of the surface mode, thus increasing its
propagation distance and the reﬂected beam shift. Simi-
larly, for large d the surface wave is not excited, and the

reﬂected beam shift becomes small again.

To understand deeper the physical mechanism for the
giant Goos-H¨anchen shift, we calculate the energy ﬂow
for the beam reﬂection and compare it with the results
for the right-hand media [9]. Figure 2(c) shows the struc-
ture of the energy ﬂow for the case of a negative lateral

3

shift. The strongly curved ﬂow lines in the upper medium
correspond to the interference of the incident and mirror-
like reﬂected beams. The ﬁnite-extension surface wave
excited in a slab along the interface has a distinctive
vortex-like structure [10]. This surface wave transfers
the energy in the negative direction, and then the energy
is reﬂected from the interface as a shifted beam.

To make our predictions more realistic, we study the
eﬀect of losses always present in left-handed materials.
We introduce losses by adding the imaginary parts to
the dielectric permittivity ǫ3 and magnetic permeability
µ3. In particular, we take Im(µ3) = −2 · 10−5 and vary
the imaginary part of ǫ3. We notice that the losses in
the left-handed medium aﬀect mostly the surface waves
and, therefore, the major eﬀect produced by the losses is
observed for the strongly shifted beam component.

We distinguish two limiting cases. When the beam is
narrow, i.e. its spectral width is large, only a part of the
beam energy is transferred to surface waves, while the
other part is reﬂected. This case is shown is Figs. 3(a,b).
In this case the increase of losses, i.e. the increase of the
absolute value of Im(ǫ3), results in the suppression of
the second peak in the reﬂected beam, which is due to
the surface wave excitation. The growth of the amplitude
of the mirror-like reﬂected beam can be explained by a
detuning from the resonance between the incident wave
and the surface polariton.

For a wide beam with a narrow spectrum, almost all
energy of the beam is transferred into a surface wave
and, therefore, the lateral shift becomes strongly aﬀected
by the losses in the left-handed medium, as shown in
Fig. 3(c). Figure 3(d) show the dependence of the re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient on the imaginary part of the dielectric
permittivity in the third medium.

In conclusion, we have described the Goos-H¨anchen
shift and splitting of a beam totally reﬂected from a lay-
ered structure with a left-handed metamaterial. The gi-
ant lateral shift of the beam is explained by the resonant
excitation of surface vortex-like polaritons at the inter-
face between the right- and left-handed materials. The
beam shift can be both positive and negative, depending
on the type of the surface waves excited at the interface.
We believe that the giant enhancement of the lateral shift
of the reﬂected beam can be employed for direct measure-
ments of the parameters of left-handed materials.

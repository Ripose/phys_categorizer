Abstract

Low-dimensional ordered arrays of optical elements can possess bound modes, having extremely

high quality factor. These elements are traditionally made of metals, which restricts their perfor-

mance due to the absorption of light. In this letter we address the question, can bound modes be

formed in dielectric systems, where the absorption of light is negligible. Our investigation of circu-

lar arrays of spherical particles shows that (1) the high quality modes can be attained there at least

for a refractive index nr > 2.57; (2) the most bound modes have nearly longitudinal polarization

tangential to the circle; (3) in practically interesting case of GaAs particles (nr = 3.5) the quality

factor of the most bound mode increases at least by order of magnitude with the addition of each

10 extra particles. We hope that this preliminary study will stimulate experimental investigations

of bound modes in dielectric particle low-dimensional arrays.

Assemblies of microsize particles serve in a variety of optical applications because of their

resonant interaction with a visible light. Although most of the present research is focused

on three dimensional (3

d) systems (e. g. photonic crystals), low-dimensional (1

d and

2

d) structures attract the increasing attention because they can be easier constructed and

maintained then their 3

d counterparts. Despite of a low dimension, even 1

d structures

can show the remarkable eﬀect of an array geometry on an absorption, a photoluminescence

and Raman scattering of light [1, 2, 3, 4]. Recently the nano-waveguide has been made of a

1

d chain of silver particles [5].

The strong dependence of light scattering and absorption on the array geometry suggests

that the polariton modes exist in extended 1

d arrays and the resonant interaction of light

−
with those modes is responsible for their properties. Each mode can be characterized by the

complex eigenfrequency z = ω + iγ/2, with the real part ω, representing the mode frequency

and the imaginary part γ representing the mode decay rate [6]. Modes of interest must have

the large quality factor Q = ω/γ because they should be capable to propagate along the

whole 1-d structure, so they have to be bound to the array.

In fact, 1

d arrays of N identical particles can possess bound modes with the quality

factor approaching inﬁnity for N

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], so γ(N =

) = 0. This takes place

in a linear chain of identical particles separated by a suﬁciently small distance a compared

to the resonant wavelength λ

a < λ/2 = c/(2ω).

(1)

If Eq. (1) is satisﬁed, then there exists at least one polariton mode having the maximum

wavevector qmax = π/a exceeding the wavevector of the resonant photon k = 2π/λ. When

the chain is inﬁnite the decay of such polariton is forbidden by the momentum conservation

law requiring k > q. In the ﬁnite system of N paticles the polariton decay rate is ﬁnite,

but it tends to zero when N

bound modes of the ﬁnite system possess a very narrow resonance, which can be used in a

variety of photonics applications including waveguides [5], antennas and detectors [7, 8, 10]

emitting or absorbing in the very narrow frequency range, close to the single photon regime

[12]. The sharp resonance leads to the well resolved far ﬁeld emission pattern which can be

used to send guiding signals to aircrafts [13]. In addition, modes possessing the high quality

factor can be used in lasers, because their small decay rate leads to the low pump threshold

[14, 15, 16, 17].

One can expect, because of the symmetry, that the highest quality factor can be attained

for particles placed into the circle and separated equally from each other (Fig. 1). The

circle has no sharp ends in contrast with the particle chain where the lifetime of polariton is

limited to the travel time between the ends of the chain [6]. Indeed, it has been demonstrated

that the modes in the circular array of cylinder-shaped antennas, perpendicular to the circle

plane, possess the quality factor growing exponentially with the number of antennas [7, 11]

(see also [18, 19]). Also the circularly shaped structural ﬂuctuations have been suggested in

Ref. [18] to explain lasing in random media [15].

We believe that the exponentially small decay rate is the common property of circular

arrays. This expectation can be justiﬁed as following. Consider the array of N identical

particles located at the circle of the radius R and separated by the distance a (see Fig. 1).

The symmetry of the problem suggests that the rotation by the angle 2π/N will change

eigenmode amplitudes by the factor exp(iqa), where the wavevector q takes values q = m/R

m = 0,

menta m. We consider only even numbers N for the sake of simplicity. The polariton can

decay, emitting the photon outside of the circle. The angular momentum of the emitted

photon takes the discrete set of values m, m + N, m

N, ... due to the rotational symmetry

−

and we study the most eﬃcient regime, when it is equal to its minimum value m. The rate

of the emission of photon, possessing the angular momentum m is deﬁned by the squared

3

overlap integral of polariton and photon wavefunctions. This integral can be estimated

using the wavefunction of the photon within the circular array (Fig. 1), characterized by

the cylinder coordinate ρ = R. This wavefunction is given by the Bessel function Jm(kR),

where k = ω/c is the wavevector of the emitted photon, and ω is its frequency. Thus one

can estimate the polariton decay rate dependence on the number of particles as

γ(k)

JqR(kR)

(2)

This result reproduces the estimate of Ref. [11] for interacting antennas in the very case of

a polariton possessing the certain quasi-angular momentum. If the argument of the Bessel

function is smaller than its index (k < q in accordance with Eq. (1)), then in the limit

one can approximate Eq. (2) by the exponential function (x = k/q) [13] (See Fig.

Exponentially narrow resonances contribute directly to the optical properties of the sys-

tem when the width of the resonance Eq. (2) exceeds the rate of the absorption of light by

particles. Metal particles or antennas always have a signiﬁcant absorption due to conducting

electrons. This is not the case for dielectric particles having negligible absorption, when the

photon energy is less than the width of the forbidden band. In addition, the optical (Mie)

resonance frequency of the dielectric particle is inversely proportional to its size and can

be easily changed to the desirable value, while the resonance of metal particles is bound to

their plasma frequency. Therefore we ﬁnd it important to test whether narrow resonances

Eq. (2) can be attained in the array of dielectric particles possessing a realistic refractive

index nr.

Bound modes have to satisfy Eq.

(1). The interparticle distance a cannot be made

smaller than the spherical particle diameter d, so we cannot satisfy the condition k < q at

any refractive index. Since the resonant wavelength increases with increasing the refractive

nr, bound modes will exist at suﬃciently large nr. Standard

index nr approximately as λ
optical materials have refractive indices of order of 1 (e. g. nr ≈
T iO2 and nr ≈
materials, can possess bound modes. Below we employ the multiple sphere Mie scattering

3.5 for GaAs). It is not clear whether the arrays of particles, made of those

modes exist at least for the particles made of GaAs and T iO2.

coeﬃcients Dp(θ) are deﬁned in Ref.

polaritons ωa and their decay rates γa.

mn = bmne2πi(m+qa)l,

(6)

where q = 2πp/(Na) is the wavevector (p =

1, 1, 2, ...N/2). Then the dimension of Eq.

−
(4) is reduced by the factor of N, because the intersphere interactions bA, bB get replaced
with their Fourier trasforms. At the next step one should restrict the maximum value of

the angular momentum n < nmax and solve the equations requiring the weak sensitivity of

the solution to the increase of nmax.

In this letter we study the simplest case nmax = 1

for coeﬃcients amn, while we set all “magnetic” coeﬃcients bmn to be equal to zero. This

approach is similar to the coupled dipolar approach. It is justiﬁed for a large refractive index
nr ≫
frequency [10]. In fact, we are interested in these modes, because they can be bound most

1 and for modes corresponding to the dipolar Mie resonances possessing the lowest

easily (cf. Eq. (1)).

The materials like T iO2 do not possess a suﬃciently high refractive index to use the

dipolar approach. However bound modes, found in the dipolar approach, will remain bound

if higher multipoles will be taken into account. In fact, higher multipoles add additional

modes generated by corresponding Mie resonances, located all above the dipolar resonance.

Those resonances can shift the energies of dipolar resonances downwards only because of

the energy level repulsion. Such a behavior has been seen, for instance, in Ref. [23] where

the rigorous approach is compared with the discrete dipolar approach. The approximate

method overestimates the size of the sphere at the resonance, which is equivalent to an

underestimate of the resonant frequency. Therefore Eq. (1) will be satisﬁed better in the

more sophisticated approach because of the increase of the resonant wavelength. Thus our

method gives upper estimates for the decay rate of bound modes and the minimum refractive

index n∗ necessary to form bound modes.

In the dipolar approach one can separate polariton modes into three branches t1, t2 and

l depending on their polarization (Fig. 1). The particle polarization for the transverse mode

t1 is perpendiqular to the array plane and it is described by the amplitude a01 (m = 0). The

6

transverse mode t2 is characterized by the particle polarizations in the radial directions of

the x

y plane. It is deﬁned by amplitudes a±11 (a−11 = 4a11 [24]). The longitudinal mode

l is characterized by the polarization tangential to the circle. It is deﬁned by amplitudes

The Fourier transform of interactions in the simpliﬁed Eq.

deﬁnitions of Ref. [20], yields the dispersion equations for all three modes t1, t2 and l, given

Then the algorithm usually converges to the frequency of the bound mode with the smallest

decay rate.

In our calculations we have used the particle diameter d = 200nm and took the minimum

possible interparticle distance a = d, where the bound modes form most easily (Eq. (1)).

Although the accurate analysis of electric and magnetic ﬁelds will be diﬃcult in this case due

to the singularity at the point, where particles touch each other [25], the dipolar approach

should still serve as a good upper estimate for mode frequencies and decay rates. The

generalization to diﬀerent particle sizes is straghtforward because frequences behave as z

FIG. 3: The dependence of polariton frequency and decay rate on the refractve index.

For large number of particles (N > 20) the smallest decay rate has been always found at

the maximum wavevector q = π/a, corresponding to the quasi-angular momentum m = N/2

[6, 8, 9, 10]), and we further discuss only that case. In accordance with Eq. (1) we

for k = Re(za/c) < π/a, ωa < ωthr =

→ ∞

are most easy to bound. Bound modes are formed when ωl(nr, q = π/a) < ωthr. According
to our calculations this happens at nr > n∗ = 2.57. The mode frequency decreases with the
number of particles for bound modes (nr > n∗) and increases with the number of particles
for unbound modes (n < n∗, see Fig. 3), which makes easier ﬁnding the crossover. The

threshold refractive index for transverse modes has been estimated as n∗

2.95. It is larger

t ≈

than that of longitudinal modes, because transverse modes have higher frequencies.

Thus we can conclude that the bound polaritons can exist in arrays of T iO2 and GaAs par-
ticles, because their refractive indices exceed the upper estimate of the threshold n∗ = 2.57.

For GaAs (nr = 3.5) transverse modes can also be bound. Decay rates of the longitudinal

modes for T iO2 and GaAs and of the transverse t1 mode for GaAs calculated at the max-

imum wavevector q = π/a are shown in Fig. 2. They all decrease exponentially with the

number of particles N and one can ﬁt this dependence with the squared Bessel function Eq.

(3) as illustrated in Fig. 2 for T iO2. As was discussed, the actual frequencies of low energy

modes are smaller than our estimate, so the decay rates should decrease faster with N than

we predicted (see Eq. (3)). Even within our approach the decay rate of the longitudinal

mode for nr = 3.5 (GaAs) decreases by order of magnitude with the addition of ten particles

to the array. Similar eﬀect in a 3

d photonic crystal can require the addition of 103

particles, which is much more diﬃcult practically. Therefore we believe that the remarkable

progress in photonics technology can be made using circular arrays of dielectric particles.

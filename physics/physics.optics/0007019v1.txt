Various algebraic structures of degenerate four-wave mixing equations of optical phase conjuga-
tion are analyzed. Two approaches (the spinorial and the Lax-pair based), complementary to each
other, are utilized for a systematic derivation of conserved quantities. Symmetry groups of both
the equations and the conserved quantities are determined, and the corresponding generators are
written down explicitly. Relation between these two symmetry groups is found. Conserved quanti-
ties enable the introduction of new methods for integration of the equations in the cases when the
coupling Γ is either purely real or purely imaginary. These methods allow for both geometries of the
process, namely the transmission and the reﬂection, to be treated on an equal basis. One approach
to introduction of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures for the 4WM systems is explored, and the
obstacles in successful implementation of that programe are identiﬁed. In case of real coupling these
obstacles are removable, and full Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of the initial system are
possible.

I. INTRODUCTION

There is a short story prefacing the paper. The work
on symmetries in optical phase conjugation started in
early nineties by Predrag Stojkov and Milivoj Beli´c. It
was interrupted by Predrag’s leaving for America in 1992.
During the stay of M. Beli´c at the Texas A&M Univer-
sity in 1995 and 1996, the problem and an early draft of
the paper were brought to Marko’s attention. At the time
he was phasing out of quasicrystals, and was open to new
ideas. Marko liked the problem and agreed to participate.
He read the manuscript, made numerous changes, and
suggested a new direction to it. Owing to his commit-
ments for the sabbatical at Cornell University in 1995
and the visit to Israel in 1996, it was decided to postpone
the serious work after he is back. However, during the
Israeli visit Marko was diagnosed with the brain tumor.
The paper is left essentially unchanged. It is dedicated to
his memory.

Steady-state four-wave mixing (4WM) equations de-
scribing optical phase conjugation (OPC) in photorefrac-
tive (PR) crystals have been solved up to now in a num-
ber of ways [1–4]. A common feature of all solution meth-
ods is that, ﬁrst, conserved quantities are determined,
and then the number of equations is reduced. However,
the determination of conserved quantities and the reduc-
tion of equations is usually performed in an ad hoc man-
ner. Furthermore, the solution of the OPC equations in
the two basic geometries of the process, the transmission
geometry and the reﬂection geometry, is usually obtained
using unrelated methods.

Apparent symmetries of wave equations have not been
used up to now [5,6] to facilitate the analysis and the

solution of the problem.
In this work the symmetries
of the equations and the integrals of motion are investi-
gated and used to present a uniﬁed method for systematic
derivation of conserved quantities, an equal treatment of
both geometries, and the reduction in the number of in-
dependent variables [7]. Such an analysis allows for not
only an easier handling of otherwise cumbersome and un-
related relations, but also for a deeper understanding of
the physics of the process. Also, rudiments of a formal
presentation of the problem along the lines of the theory
of dynamical systems are presented.

The geometry of the process is simple. Three laser
beams intersect within a piece of the PR crystal: two
counterpropagating laser pumps A1 and A2, and a signal
A4. Owing to the PR eﬀect, a fourth wave A3 is gener-
ated inside the crystal, that counterpropagates to, and is
the phase conjugate replica of the signal. There are two
main channels along which the generation may proceed.
In the ﬁrst one, the signal wave builds a diﬀraction grat-
ing with the pump A1. The other pump is diﬀracted oﬀ
that grating and transmitted across the crystal into the
PC wave A3. This is the so-called transmission geometry
(TG) of the process.

In the second channel the signal interferes with the
pump A2, and the beam A1 is reﬂected oﬀ the grating
into the PC wave. This is the reﬂection geometry (RG)
of the 4WM process. It is assumed that all waves oscil-
late at the same frequency (the degenerate 4WM). Also, a
steady-state is assumed, and all beams are approximated
by plane waves.

The equations of interest are the slowly varying enve-
lope wave equations describing 4WM in PR media [1]. In
TG, they are of the form

TG and −1 for RG, and Π±σ = (1 ± σ)/2 are the corre-

The analysis is organized as follows. Two methods
to derive the integrals of motion (IOM) are discussed in
Section II. The ﬁrst method is based on the observation
that 4WM EOM have a special symmetric form that is
allowing an equivalent spinorial formulation. Such a form
of EOM leads directly to the derivation of the full set of
”regular” IOM as suitable bi-spinorial combinations. The
symmetries of these IOM are the special unitary groups:
SU (2) for TG, and SU (1, 1) for RG. Initial spinor-like
doublets of ﬁelds turn out to transform as the funda-
mental irreducible representations of these groups, thus
justifying the name ”spinors”. It is indicated how they
can be used to reduce the number of dynamical variables.
In the second method the Lax pair approach is uti-
lized. The diadic products of the 4WM spinors are used
as possible choices for the evolving member (L) of the
Lax pair problem. The traces of products of these ma-
trices represent IOM. It was established that all higher

order IOM are various combinations of the basic IOM
already obtained by the spinorial approach. At the end
of Section II two special cases (Γ ∈ R and Γ ∈ iR) are
considered in some detail.
In Section III attention is focused on the derivation
of the symmetry groups of EOM, and the corresponding
generators. The relation between these symmetries and
the symmetries of IOM is discussed.

In Section IV the symmetries of IOM are used to write
the solutions of EOM (for Γ ∈ R) in terms of elementary
transcendental functions. Then an alternative solution
procedure is explored. In the last part of Section IV the
Γ ∈ iR case is solved completely.
The possibility of introducing the Hamiltonian and La-
grangian description of 4WM EOM is explored in Section
V. Section VI oﬀers some conclusions and identiﬁes open
questions for future research.

II. INTEGRALS OF MOTION AND THEIR

SYMMETRIES

A. Preliminaries

In this work the 4WM equations are treated as a dy-
namical system deﬁned on the phase space V :≡ ˜V /ρ ≡
R8, with the time variable z. Here ˜V is the full sixteen-
dimensional space ˜V :≡ C8 ≡ R16 with the complex co-
ordinates {xµ} ≡ {Bi, ¯Bi} and ρ is the equivalence rela-
tion (analyticity condition) satisﬁed by the 4WM system:
xi+4 = (xi)∗ [i.e. ¯Bi = (Bi)∗] for i = 1, 4. The tangent
space T V (the space of vector ﬁelds on V ), is spanned by
the coordinate basis {∂µ} ≡ {∂i = ∂/∂Bi; ¯∂i = ∂/∂ ¯Bi}.
The dynamics on the space V is given by the trajectory
c : Rz → V . It is described by the velocity vector-ﬁeld
~F ∈ T V :

~F = µ(σB3∂1 − B2∂4) + ¯µ(σB4∂2 − B1∂3) + c.c.

(2.1)

where µ :≡ ΓQ/I. For a general function f (z, x) ∈
C1(Rz × V ), the corresponding evolution equation is

(cid:18) df
dz(cid:19) = (∂z + ~F )f .

(2.2)

In general, an integral of motion (IOM) q(z, x) is a
function that is constant along the trajectory c,
i.e.
(∂z + ~F )q|c = 0 (on-shell constancy). Here the more
restrictive deﬁnition of IOM is used:
instead of an
on-shell constancy, the condition of oﬀ-shell constancy
[(∂z + ~F )q = 0 in whole V ] is used. Also, only the inte-
grals q(x) without the explicit time-dependence are con-
sidered, leading to the deﬁning equation

~F q = 0.

(2.3)

2

There is no general procedure for ﬁnding IOM, and one
has to take into account various speciﬁcs of the system at
hand. For example, one may resort to the brute-force so-
lution procedure, which is based on the observation that
~F is a linear diﬀerential operator of the zeroth degree of
homogeneity (i.e. upon its action on some homogeneous
function Ps(x) of degree s, it produces another homoge-
neous function of the same degree s). This allows one to
replace Eq. (2.3) by the set of inﬁnitely many equations:

~F q(s) = 0,

(2.4)

for s ∈ N, where q(s) are the components of q with the
ﬁxed degree of homogeneity s (q = P∞
s=1 q(s)). In gen-
eral, Eqs. (2.4) can be solved by a general ansatz (the
summation over the repeated indices is assumed):

q(1) = αµxµ,
q(2) = αµν xµxν,

···

(2.5)

which turns Eq. (2.4) into a set of conditions for the ma-
trices α. After some algebra, one ﬁnds that there are no
integrals of the ﬁrst degree, and that there are several of
the second and higher degrees.

B. Spinorial formalism

There exists a more elegant way to ﬁnd integrals of
motion of the second degree of homogeneity in the 4WM
equations [6]. It is based on the fact that convenient pairs
of columns (”spinors”) can be formed:

B3(cid:19) ,
|ψ1i =(cid:18) B1

|ψ2i =(cid:18) B4

−σB2(cid:19) .

(2.6)

Now the equations of motion (1.4) can be written as a
pair of matrix equations:

|ψji′ = m |ψji ,

(j = 1, 2)

where the ”evolution matrix” m is

m =(cid:18) 0
−¯µ

σµ

0 (cid:19) ,

(2.7)

(2.8)

and µ = ΓQ/I. The matrix m is traceless and Hermitian
(for TG) or skew-Hermitian (for RG), so it belongs to the
su(2) algebra for TG, or to the su(1, 1) for RG.

IOM are found using a simple Lemma:

• Lemma 1 : A pair of linear matrix equations

|ψAi′ = mA |ψAi , |ψBi′ = mB |ψBi ,

(2.9)

has an integral of motion hψA| n|ψBi, if there exists a
constant matrix n such that

nmB + m†

An = 0,

(2.10)

3

where the dagger denotes the adjoint matrix.

In 4WM the IOM are searched for in two possible

forms, as hψi| n|ψji or as (cid:10) ¯ψi(cid:12)(cid:12) n|ψji. For the ﬁrst form,

we have the deﬁning equation (2.10) speciﬁed as

nm + m†n = 0,

(2.11)

whereas for the second form of integrals, the deﬁning
equation is

nm + mT n = 0.

(2.12)

For the general (complex) Γ, the unique solutions (up to
rescaling by a constant) of these deﬁning equations are
the matrices

0

n1 =(cid:18) 1

0 σ(cid:19) =(cid:26) 1 for TG,

σ3 for RG,

(2.13)

for (2.11) and

n2 = (cid:18) 0 −σ

0 (cid:19) = −σiσ2 =(cid:26)−iσ2 for TG,

iσ2 for RG,

σ

(2.14)

for (2.12), where σj are the Pauli matrices. The corre-
sponding integrals are

(2.15)

q1 = hψ1| n1 |ψ1i = I1 + σI3,
q2 = hψ2| n1 |ψ2i = I2 + σI4,
q3 = hψ2| n1 |ψ1i = B1 ¯B4 − B3 ¯B2,
q4 = (cid:10) ¯ψ1(cid:12)(cid:12) n2 |ψ2i = B1B2 + σB3B4.

Since these IOM are present for arbitrary complex cou-
pling Γ, they are said to be the regular IOM of the 4WM
system. Later it will be shown that for special choices of
Γ this system possesses additional (exceptional) IOM.

Not all of the conserved quantities q1, q2 , q3, ¯q3 , q4

and ¯q4 are independent. There exists a relation

|q4|2 + σ|q3|2 = q1q2

(2.16)

that reduces the number of (real) integrals of motion to
ﬁve. Using the integrals, one can express the conjugated
ﬁelds as dependent variables:

¯B1 = [σB3 ¯q3 + B2q1]/q4,
¯B2 = [B1q2 − σB4q3]/q4,
¯B3 = [B4q1 − B1 ¯q3]/q4,
¯B4 = [B2q3 + B3q2]/q4.

(2.17)

A more natural way to reduce the number of variables
using conserved quantities is to introduce polar coordi-
nates, suggested by the form of the conserved quantities
q1 and q2:

B1 = √q1c(σ, α1) exp(iβ1),
B2 = √q2c(σ, α2) exp(iβ2),
B3 = √q1s(σ, α1) exp(iγ1),
B4 = √q2s(σ, α2) exp(iγ2).

(2.18)

Here the new variables are the six angles: α1, α2, β1, β2,
γ1, and γ2. The symbols c and s stand for the trigono-
metric cosine and sine functions in the TG case, and for
the hyperbolic cosine and sine in RG case (see Appendix
A).

To further ilucidate the connection between IOM and
the new variables, it is convenient to employ the integral
q, introduced below [Eq. (2.41)]. It can be expressed in
terms of the new variables, and the result is

q = q2

2 + 2q1q2[c(σ, 2α1)c(σ, 2α2)+

1 + q2
+σs(σ, 2α1)s(σ, 2α2) cos(Φ)],

(2.19)

where Φ = β1 +β2−γ1−γ2 is the so-called relative phase.
From the spherical and the hyperbolic [8] trigonometry
it is known that the expression in brackets can be un-
derstood as a cosine (hyperbolic cosine) of some angle ρ,
so that 2α1 , 2α2 and ρ are the sides of a spherical (hy-
perbolic) triangle, and Φ is its central angle. Therefore

c(σ, ρ) =

1 − q2
q − q2
2q1q2

2

= const.

(2.20)

and Φ only depends on α1 and α2 :

cos(Φ) =

c(σ, ρ) − c(σ, 2α1)c(σ, 2α2)

σs(σ, 2α1)s(σ, 2α2)

.

(2.21)

∂zhψµ| = −σhψµ|m,

(2.24)
where the index µ = i,¯i and |ψ¯ii :≡ n1n2| ¯ψii. The fol-
lowing matrices

Lµν :≡ |ψµihψν|n1,

satisfy the Lax pair equations

∂zLµν = [m,Lµν ].

The corresponding Laxian IOM are given by

qµ1ν1···µkνk :≡ Tr (Lµ1ν1 ···Lµkνk ) .

For k = 1 we have

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

.

(2.28)

For higher k, the resulting IOM are the products of q(1).
For example,

q(2)µναβ = q(1)ανq(1)µβ.

Thus, the higher Laxian IOM are not yielding any new
independent integrals.

An alternative variant of the Lax pair approach is pre-

sented in Appendix B.

It is easy to check that:

D. I-Symmetry

|q4|2 = q1q2c(cid:16)σ,
|q3|2 = q1q2s(cid:16)σ,

ρ

ρ

,

(2.22)

in agreement with Eq. (2.16). Thus, there are ﬁve in-
dependent real conserved quantities: q1, q2, ρ, and the
phases of q3 and q4. The solution of EOM using these
quantities is performed in Sec. IV.

C. Lax Pairs

The Lax pair representation (if it exists) helps deter-
mination of the integrals of motion. In general, if given
dynamical system admits a Lax pair representation

d ˆL
dz

= [ ˆM, ˆL],

(2.23)

where ˆL and ˆM are suitably chosen operators or matri-
ces, then all the traces T r( ˆLk) (k ∈ N) are IOM. The
determination of such a Lax pair of operators ( ˆM, ˆL) is
usually the hardest part of the problem. The brackets in
Eq. (2.23) stand for the commutator.

In the case of 4WM, the suitable matrices are easy
to ﬁnd, starting from the compact form of the spinorial
EOM (2.7) and their conjugated equations:

∂z|ψµi = m|ψµi,

• Deﬁnition 1 : The symmetry of the set of integrals
{qα} (the I-symmetry) is the mapping {xµ} → {x′µ}
which preserves the analytical structure (x′)i+4 = ((x′)i)∗
and leaves all the integrals invariant qα(x′) = qα(x).

I-symmetries deﬁne the algebraic structure of the sis-
tem at hand. In practice one ﬁrst calculates the inﬁnites-
imal I-symmetries, given by

δqα(x) ≡ ~lqα ≡ δxµ∂µqα = 0,

(2.29)

where ~l = ωµ(x)∂µ is the generating vector ﬁeld, and then
establishes the large (non-inﬁnitesimal) I-symmetries, by
exponentiating the inﬁnitesimal ones. This is the stan-
dard procedure in the theory of Lie-groups.

Although in general the coeﬃcients ωµ are nonlinear
functions of {x} (the nonlinear I-symmetries), here only
the linear I-symmetry algebras will be considered. These
can be calculated easily by a linear ansatz ωµ = aµ
νxν .
In this way a general linear symmetry of the full set
{q1,··· , ¯q4} of the regular IOM is found:

2δB1 = +iǫ3B1 + (ǫ2 + iǫ1)B3,
2δB2 = −iǫ3B2 + (ǫ2 − iǫ1)B4,
2δB3 = −iǫ3B3 − σ(ǫ2 − iǫ1)B1,
2δB4 = +iǫ3B4 − σ(ǫ2 + iǫ1)B2.

(2.30)

In the spinor notation the matrix form of I-symmetries

is

4

δ |ψ1,2i = ΣT |ψ1,2i ,

where the traceless matrix Σ is given by

(2.31)

Σ =

2(cid:18) iǫ3

ǫ2 + iǫ1

−σ(ǫ2 − iǫ1)

−iǫ3

(cid:19) = iǫaSa,

and {ǫa} are real parameters. The basis matrices (the
generators) are

(2.33)

The set of all matrices Σ that are traceless and satisfy
the generalized hermiticity condition Σ†η+ηΣ = 0 forms
the Lie-algebra su(2) for TG, and su(1, 1) for RG. The
matrix η = n1 is called the su(2)/su(1, 1) metric matrix.
The generators {Sa} obey the standard commutation re-
lations

[S1, S2] = −iσS3 ,
[S2, S3] = −iS1 ,
[S3, S1] = −iS2 .

(2.34)

Thus, both |ψ1i and |ψ2i are transforming according to
the fundamental (spinorial) representation of the corre-
sponding algebra gI .

Every ﬁnite Lie-algebra g has the corresponding Lie-
group G of ”large” transformations, obtained via expo-
nential mapping:

∀Σ ∈ g ⇒ G :≡ exp(iΣ) ∈ G.

For gI = su(2) (the TG case), the group is GI = SU (2),
and for gI = su(1, 1) (the RG case), the group is SU (1, 1),
the noncompact version of SU (2). Both groups can
be represented by sets of 2 × 2 complex matrices G
that are unimodular (det G = 1) and (pseudo)unitary
(G†ηG = η).

The Cayley-Klein parameterization of the general

SU (2)/SU (1, 1) group element

G =(cid:18) y1 + iy2
−σ(y3 − iy4)

y3 + iy4

y1 − iy2(cid:19) ,

(2.35)

where y1,···,4 ∈ R, turns the unimodality condition into a
geometric relation (the deﬁnition of the parameter man-
ifold of the group GI ):

det G = (y1)2 + (y2)2 + σ(cid:2)(y3)2 + (y4)2(cid:3) = 1.

(2.36)

Thus, the parameter manifold for SU (2)I is the sphere
S3, and for SU (1, 1)I it is the hyperboloid H3, both em-
bedded in R4. (For a short classiﬁcation of hyperboloids
in R4 see Appendix C.)

From this fact alone, one could expect that the TG case
will be expressed in a natural way in terms of the trigono-
metric functions, and the RG case in terms of both the
trigonometric functions (compact dimensions) and the
hyperbolic functions (noncompact dimensions). In this
sense the cases are ”twins”, i.e.
there is a number of
equations holding in both cases, up to the exchange of
the trigonometric/hyperbolic functions.

E. Action of I-Symmetries on the Lax variables

It is of interest to know the action of the I-symmetries
on the Lax matrices Lµν . Since the Lax matrices are con-
structed out of the basic spinors, some regularity must
be induced in the transformation law of these variables.
For example, for L11 = |ψ1ihψ1|n1, the action of the

inﬁnitesimal I-symmetry yields

δL11 = ΣTL11 + L11n−1

1 Σ∗n1.

Owing to matrix identities n−1
−ΣT , this expression simpliﬁes to

1 = n1 and n1Σ∗n1 =

δL11 =(cid:2)ΣT ,L11(cid:3) .

This represents the adjoint action of the I-symmetry on
L11. In a similar way, one ﬁnds that the same transfor-
mation law is valid for all Lµν:

(2.37)

(2.38)

δLµν = (cid:2)ΣT ,Lµν(cid:3) .

Thus, due to cyclic invariance of the matrix trace oper-
ation, all Laxian IOM are invariant upon the action of
I-symmetries. This is expected.

F. Exceptional IOM

The ”regular” IOM, obtained in the subsection II B,
form the full set of IOM for the complex coupling Γ. How-
ever, in the special cases when Γ is either real or imagi-
nary, there exist additional IOM. These will be called the
”exceptional” IOM.

To see the signiﬁcance of these special cases, let us
evaluate the ”time”-change of the grating amplitude Q:

IQ′ = −ΓQq5.

(2.39)
Here q5 is the expression q5 = I1 + I2 − σ(I3 + I4), whose
”time”-change is

Iq′

5 = 4σRe (Γ)|Q|2.

(2.40)

Notice that q5 is IOM in the case of imaginary Γ (so, it
is an ”exceptional” IOM). However, when Γ is a complex
number, this quantity turns out to be a suitable variable
for later calculations.

From equations (2.39) and (2.40) another conserved

quantity (for the general, complex Γ) is obtained:

5

q = (q1 + q2)2 − 4σ|q3|2.

Nevertheless, q5 plays an important role in one of the two
presented procedures for solving EOM in the Γ ∈ R case.

From Eq. (2.39), two important relations follow:

I|Q|′ = −Re (Γ)|Q|q5,

Iarg(Q)′ = −Im (Γ)q5.

(2.43)

These equations indicate the existence of two important
special cases: Γ ∈ R and Γ ∈ iR. The case Im Γ = 0
implies arg Q = const, so that φ :≡ arg µ = const, while
the case Re Γ = 0 implies that |Q| = const. The Γ ∈ R
case is considered ﬁrst.

1. Γ ∈ R

Analysis of this case is based on the fact that the phase
φ of the grating amplitude Q is constant for real cou-
plings. This allows introduction of a new independent
0 dz′|µ(z′)| + θ0, which casts the prob-
lem into a linear form. The matrix m is now replaced by

These IOM are the same as the ones already obtained

Here the condition n−1

ways:

• Case 1: ν2 = −σ. This corresponds to φ = ±π/2 (in
TG) and to φ = 0 or π (in RG). This case allows for the
full suI symmetry, i.e. all three ǫa parameters can have
non-zero values. However, only the diagonal part of ΣT

which is symmetric. Having the new matrices n3 and
n4 that satisfy the Lemma, a set of additional conserved
quantities can be constructed:

w2 :≡ hψ2| n3 |ψ2i = −2iσIm (ν ¯B4B2),
w3 :≡ hψ1| n3 |ψ2i = −σν ¯B1B2 − ¯ν ¯B3B4
w4 :≡ (cid:10) ¯ψ1(cid:12)(cid:12) n4 |ψ1i = ¯νB2
w5 :≡ (cid:10) ¯ψ1(cid:12)(cid:12) n4 |ψ2i = ¯νB1B4 − νB3B2,

Note that hψ2| n3 |ψ1i = −w3 and (cid:10) ¯ψ2(cid:12)(cid:12) n4 |ψ1i = w5.

(2.47)

• Case 2: ν2 6= −σ. Here only the diagonal part of
I-symmetries survives, i.e. ǫ1 and ǫ2 have to be set equal
to zero. The transformation law still has the same form
as in the case above.

Thus, the w IOM are invariant under the full suI sym-
metry algebra if ν2 = −σ, and under the u1 subalgebra
generated by σ3/2 if ν2 6= −σ.
An important special case is the phase conjugation,
when the relative phase Φ (≡ β1 + β2 − γ1 − γ2) is
constant (0 or π). Then, using relations (2.18) and the
fact that the argument φ (= β1 − γ1 = γ2 − β2) of µ
is constant, the following values for the integrals w are
obtained:

w1 = 0,
w2 = 0,

w3 = −√q1q2c(σ, α1 − α2) exp(i(β2 − γ1)),
w6 = −√q1q2s(σ, α1 − α2) exp(i(β1 + β2)).

w4 = q1 exp(i(β1 + γ1)),
w5 = σq2 exp(i(β2 + γ2)),

(2.51)

These relations imply that all the phases β1, β2, γ1, γ2
are constant, and that the α-variables are linearly depen-
dent: α1−α2 = constant. Hence, all the ﬁelds essentially
depend on only one real quantity, for example on α1.

The parameters θ0 and θ4 correspond to the two noncom-
pact dimensions of the symmetry group GE, i.e. their val-
ues are arbitrary real numbers. This is in contrast to the
rest of the parameters, which are periodic. So, the group
of E-symmetries GE ≡ exp gE is R ⊗ U (1)2 ⊗ SU (1, 1).
It is easy to check [from the deﬁning relation (3.1)] that
the E-symmetries always map the integrals of motion to
the integrals of motion (and also the solutions of EOM
to the solutions of EOM). Hence:

δq1 = 2θ0q1 + (θ4 + iθ5)¯q4 + (θ4 − iθ5)q4,
δq2 = 2θ0q2 − (θ4 + iθ5)¯q4 − (θ4 − iθ5)q4,
δq3 = [2θ0 + i(θ2 + θ3)]q3,
δq4 = 2(θ0 + iθ1)q4 + (θ4 + iθ5)(q2 − q1).

(3.7)

This is a version of the N¨other theorem: If one of IOM
is taken as the ”Hamiltonian” H of the system, then the
action ~Li(H) of each ~Li on such a Hamiltonian produces
another IOM.

Here, the following linear combinations of regular
IOM are forming the irreducible representations of the
u(1)L0⊕su(1, 1)L1,L4,L5 algebra under the E-symmetries:
q1 + q2, q3 and ¯q3 form singlets

The case of Γ imaginary has only one exceptional in-
tegral, q5. The corresponding I-symmetry of the set
{q1, ..., q5} is restricted to the diagonal part of Eq. (2.30):

2δB1 = iǫ3B1,
2δB2 = −iǫ3B2,
2δB3 = −iǫ3B3,
2δB4 = iǫ3B4 .

This is a u(1) algebra of the transformations:

(2.52)

(2.53)

and the corresponding group is U (1). The parameter
space of this group is the circle S1 of circumference 4π.
That group is the subgroup of both SU (2)I and SU (1, 1)I
groups.

III. SYMMETRIES OF THE EQUATIONS OF

MOTION

In general, one should distinguish the symmetries of
the integrals of motion from the symmetries of the equa-
tions of motion.

• Deﬁnition 2 : E-symmetries [9]: Any vector-ﬁeld
~L that satisﬁes the master equation

h~L, ~Fi = 0,

is the symmetry of the dynamical equations (1.4).

(3.1)

The set gE of E-symmetries is also a Lie-algebra, i.e. it
is linear, and the commutator of any two E-symmetries
is another E-symmetry. So, one can describe the full al-
gebra by its generators and their commutation relations.
The E-symmetries are sought in the form of the most

general linear ansatz

~L = xµaµ

ν∂ν .

(3.2)

δ(q1 + q2) = 2θ0(q1 + q2),

After some algebra, six generators are found for the 4WM
system:

~L0 = B1∂1 + B2∂2 + B3∂3 + B4∂4 + c.c.,
~L1 = i(B1∂1 + B2∂2 + B3∂3 + B4∂4 − c.c.),
~L2 = i(B1∂1 − B2∂2 − c.c.),
~L3 = i(B3∂3 − B4∂4 − c.c.),
~L4 = ¯B2∂1 − ¯B1∂2 + ¯B4∂3 − ¯B3∂4 + c.c.,
~L5 = i( ¯B2∂1 − ¯B1∂2 + ¯B4∂3 − ¯B3∂4 − c.c.). (3.3)
These six generators form the complete set of linear E-
symmetries for the general (complex) Γ. They generate

7

δq3 = [2θ0 + i(θ2 + θ3)]q3,
δ¯q3 = [2θ0 − i(θ2 + θ3)]¯q3,

(3.8)

while |Ti :≡ (cid:8)q4, (q1 − q2)/√2, ¯q4(cid:9)T
is transforming as
the triplet representation δ|Ti = P|Ti, where P is given
by
2(θ0 + iθ1) −√2(θ4 + iθ5)

√2(θ4 − iθ5)
−√2(θ4 − iθ5)


2(θ0 − iθ1) 
 .

Hence, one can start from the knowledge of only q1
and recover the (almost) full set of regular integrals
{q1, q2, q4, ¯q4}, by acting on them with the E-symmetries.

√2(θ4 + iθ5)

A. Γ ∈ R

In the Γ ∈ R case, one can apply the same linear ansatz
as in the general case. The set of linear E-symmetries
thus obtained is {~L0,··· , ~L7}, where ~L0−5 are the already
known generators (3.3), and the two additional genera-
tors are found for the RG case:

~L6 = B4∂1 − B3∂2 + B2∂3 − B1∂4 + c.c.,
~L7 = i( ¯B4∂1 + ¯B3∂2 + ¯B2∂3 + ¯B1∂4 − c.c.).

(3.9)

An alternative approach is to perform the redeﬁnition
z → θ(z) of the ”time” variable (introduced in the previ-
ous section), making the matrix ˜m = (cid:18) 0
0 (cid:19) con-
−¯ν

stant. This allows one to translate the vector-ﬁeld lan-
guage (applicable in the general case) into the matrix
language. Deﬁne the column

σν

|Ψi ≡


|ψ1i
|ψ2i
|ψ¯1i
|ψ¯2i




.

(3.10)

The evolution equation (2.7) can now be written as

∂θ |Ψi = M|Ψi ,

where the constant evolution matrix is

(3.11)

M :≡ 14 ⊗ ˜m =


(3.12)

The master equation (3.1) now has the matrix form

[K, M] = 0,

(3.13)

where the matrix K = (Kµν ) deﬁnes the inﬁnitesi-
mal symmetry of the big ”spinor” δ|Ψi = K|Ψi (here
µ, ν ∈ {1, 2, ¯1, ¯2}). The above master equation is trans-
lated into ”smaller” versions [Kµν, ˜m] = 0, valid for each
2×2 block matrix Kµν. Solutions of these ”small” master
equations are all of the same form

Kµν = αµν 12 + βµν ˜m,

(∀µ, ν).

constraints

The analiticity conditions |ψ¯ii = n1n2(cid:12)(cid:12)

α¯ij = −σαi¯j,
α¯i¯j = αij,

β¯ij = −σβi¯j ,
β¯i¯j = βij ,

i.e.

K¯ij = −σαi¯j 12 − σβi¯j ˜m,
K¯i¯j = α¯i¯j 12 + β¯i¯j ˜m.

Hence:

(3.14)

¯ψi(cid:11) yield the

(3.15)

+αij(cid:12)(cid:12)ψ¯j(cid:11) + βij ˜m(cid:12)(cid:12)ψ¯j(cid:11) .

In this way the rescaled EOM have 32 symmetries, char-
acterized by the the real and the imaginary parts of the
parameters {αij, βij, αi¯j , βi¯j} (i, j = 1, 2).

(3.17)

B. On the relation between I-symmetries and

E-symmetries

One may ask the question, what is the relation be-
tween the two groups of symmetries: I-symmetries and
E-symmetries? The following general consideration clar-
iﬁes this issue a bit. Let ~F be the EOM vector ﬁeld,
δ an arbitrary E-symmetry, δ an arbitrary I-symmetry,
and q an arbitrary IOM. Since [ ~F , δ] ≡ 0 and ~F (q) ≡ 0,
it follows that ~F (δq) = 0, i.e.
δq ∼ q (N¨other theo-
rem: E-symmetry of IOM is also IOM). From this con-
clusion and from δq ≡ 0 it follows that [δ, δ]q = 0, i.e.
[δ, δ] ∼ δ (E-symmetry maps an I-symmetry into another
I-symmetry). Hence, one expects that [~Li, ~Sa] ∼ ~Sb.
This can be explicitly checked in the case of 4WM sys-
tem: the generators ~Li for i ∈ {0, 1, 4, 5} commute with
all three ~Sa generators, whereas the remaining two E-
symmetries ~L2,3 have nontrivial commutators with ~Sa:

[~L2, ~S1 ± ~S2] = ∓i(cid:16)~S1 ± ~S2(cid:17) ,
[~L3, ~S1 ± ~S2] = ±i(cid:16)~S1 ± ~S2(cid:17) ,

[~L2,3, ~S3] = 0.

(3.18)
Thus the su(1, 1)E symmetry (generated by {~L1, ~L4, ~L5})
commutes with the su(2)I /su(1, 1)I symmetry.

IV. SOLUTION PROCEDURES

A. Γ ∈ R: The ﬁrst procedure

We present in detail the solution procedures for the
case when Γ is real. This case is physically the most rele-
vant. The case when Γ is imaginary, is treated similarly.
The equations for α1 and α2, extracted from Eqs.

(1.4), form a closed system of equations:

2Iα′
2Iα′

1 = −Γ [q1s(σ, 2α1) + q2s(σ, 2α2) cos(Φ)] ,
2 = −Γ [q1s(σ, 2α1) cos(Φ) + q2s(σ, 2α2)] ,

(4.1)

which can be integrated with little diﬃculty. Once α1
and α2 are known, the remaining four angles are found
easily:

2Iβ′

1 = −σΓq2 sin(Φ)s(σ, 2α2)t(σ, α1),

2Iβ′
2Iγ′
2Iγ′

2 = −σΓq1 sin(Φ)s(σ, 2α1)t(σ, α2),
1 = −Γq2 sin(Φ)s(σ, 2α2)ct(σ, α1),
2 = −Γq1 sin(Φ)s(σ, 2α1)ct(σ, α2),

(4.2)

where t and ct are the remaining two trigonomet-
ric/hyperbolic functions, formed by using the rule (A4)
(see Appendix A).

Equations (4.1) are integrated as follows. First, two

new variables are introduced:

x1 = c(σ, 2α1), x2 = c(σ, 2α2).

(4.3)

In terms of these variables q5 = q1x1 + q2x2 , and Eqs.
(4.1) become

Ix′
Ix′

1 = Γ [q1 + q2c(σ, ρ) − x1q5] ,
2 = Γ [q2 + q1c(σ, ρ) − x2q5] .

(4.4)

Note that, due to symmetry, only one of Eqs. (4.4) is
independent. The solution of the other is obtained from
the solution of the ﬁrst one by interchanging q1 and q2 .
This, however, holds only when Γ is real. On the other
hand, using Eq. (2.41), Eq. (2.40) can be written as:

(4.5)

Iq′

5 = Γ(cid:0)q − q2
5(cid:1) .

The integration of this equation depends on the geome-
try. For TG, the total intensity is constant (I = q1 + q2),
so that

.

For RG, the intensity is not constant, and

(4.6)

B. Γ ∈ R: The second procedure

Another convenient method for solution of 4WM equa-
tions is based on the linearization procedure (the replace-
ment of the ”time” variable z by the variable θ(z) =
R z
0 |µ(z′)|dz′ + θ0). Then (2.7) remains the same, but the
matrix m → ˜m becomes constant [µ → ν = exp(iφ)].
The explicit solution of Eqs.(2.7) is now

|ψj(θ)i = (cid:18) c(σ, Θ)
−¯νs(σ, Θ)

σνs(σ, Θ)

c(σ, Θ) (cid:19)|ψj(θ0)i ,

(4.11)

where Θ = θ − θ0 and θ0 is to be determined from the
boundary conditions. The subscript 0 stands for the
quantities evaluated at z = 0. The matrix in Eq. (4.11)
explicitly displays the SU nature of the symmetry of so-
lutions, and allows for an easy identiﬁcation of Euler an-
gles for the problem: α = φ, β = 2θ, γ = −φ. In this
formulation (real Γ) only one independent variable (θ) is
found necessary. The angle φ is ﬁxed by the boundary
conditions.

The evaluation of θ0 is facilitated by writing |Q| and

q5 in terms of θ:

|Q| = √qs(σ, 2θ)/2, q5 = −σ√qc(σ, 2θ).

(4.12)

The form of the solution is diﬀerent in the two geome-
tries, since I is constant in TG, whereas it is not in RG.
At this point the symmetry in treating the two geome-
tries is broken. The solution of Eq. (4.5) is

tan(θ) = tan(θ0) exp (√qΓz/I) ,

(4.13)

Z q5dq5
q − q2

5

= Γz.

(4.7)

in TG, and

The value of the integral in TG depends on whether q is
larger or smaller than q2

q5(z) = √q tanh(cid:20)tanh−1(cid:18) q5(0)

√q (cid:19) +

5 . For the ﬁrst case:
√q
I

whereas for the second:

q5(z) = √q cotanh(cid:20)cotanh−1(cid:18) q5(0)

√q (cid:19) +

Γz(cid:21) (4.8)
√q
I

Γz(cid:21) .

(4.9)

In RG:

q2
5(z) = q2

5(0) exp(−2Γz) + q [1 − exp(−2Γz)] .

(4.10)

Once q5 is determined, Eqs. (4.4) for x1 and x2 (i.e. α1
and α2) can be integrated. The problem, therefore, can
be reduced to the determination of one variable. Other
variables can be solved in quadratures. To complete the
solution, it remains to ﬁt boundary conditions. This
problem, however, is more conveniently addressed by an
alternative solution procedure.

sinh(2θ) = sinh(2θ0) exp(Γz),

(4.14)

in RG. The procedure for evaluation of θ0 is also diﬀerent
in the two geometries. We ﬁrst present the TG case.

The angle θ0 is found when boundary conditions are
applied to the solution given by Eq. (4.13). The condi-
tions are that the ﬁelds are given at the opposite faces of
the crystal: Aj(z = 0 or z = d) = Cj. In OPC C3 = 0.
Using these conditions, a number of auxiliary quantities
is deﬁned:

u = |C4|2 − |C1|2 + |C2|2,
v = |C4|2 − |C1|2 − |C2|2,
p = 2C1 ¯C4 exp(−iφ),
α = exp (−√qΓd/I) ,

(all real), and a shorthand notation is introduced:

x = tan(θd − θ0), y = tan(θd + θ0).

(4.15)

(4.16)

There exists a rational relation connecting x and y:

y =

ux + p
v − px

, x =

vy − p
u + py

.

(4.17)

9

It is seen that x and y depend on θ0 and [through Eq.
(4.13)] on q. However, there also exists a relation ex-
pressing x (and likewise y) only through q:

x = −

c

q − a ±"(cid:18) c

q − a(cid:19)2

q − b

q − a#1/2

,

−

(4.18)

where a = p2 + u2 , b = p2 + v2 , c = p(u− v) = 2p|C2|2 .
This relation is used to write an implicit equation for q:

α = ξ2 − η2,

(4.19)

where ξ = (1 − α)/2x, η = (1 + α)/2y. Thus, given the
boundary conditions, Eq. (4.19) is to be solved numeri-
cally, to determine q. Given q, x and y are found, and θ0
evaluated from the relation

tan(θ0) =

α

ξ + η

.

(4.20)

This completes the TG procedure.

For RG, one ﬁnds two expressions for the modulus of

the grating |Q| at z = 0:

µ(z) = |µ0| exp(iφ0 − iΩz),

(4.27)
where |µ0| :≡ |˜Γ||Q|/I, φ0 :≡ π/2 + arg ˜Γ + arg(Q(0))
and Ω :≡ ˜Γq5/I.
Now the evolution matrix m(z) from the spinor EOM
(2.7) has the form

m(z) =(cid:18)

0

−|µ0|e−iφ0+iΩz

σ|µ0|eiφ0−iΩz

0

(cid:19) , (4.28)

and the formal solutions of EOM (2.7) are

|ψi(z)i = U(z)|ψi(0)i.

(4.29)

The U(z) matrix is the ordered exponential (see Ap-
pendix D for a discussion) of m(z):

U(z) =(cid:18)exp(cid:18)Z z

0

dz′m(z′)(cid:19)(cid:19)+

(4.30)

where the plus subscript indicates the path-ordered na-
ture of the exponential. In practice, to obtain the explicit
form of U(z) in terms of non-ordered quantities, one has
to solve the initial value problem (IVP)

(4.21)

∂zU(z) = m(z)U(z),

U(0) = 1.

(4.31)

|Q0| = tanh(Θd)|C|2/(e − 1) =
= |p|sech(cid:0)|C1|2 + |C4|2(cid:1) ,

where |C|2 = P|Ci|2 , e = exp(Γd), and now |p| =
| ¯C2C4|. This yields an expression for sinh(Θd):

sinh(Θd) =

|p|(e − 1)

e (|C1|2 + |C4|2) + |C2|2 .

(4.22)

Using Eqs. (4.21) and (4.22), an expression for tanh(2θ0)
is obtained:

sinh(2Θd)

tanh(2θ0) =

e − cosh(2Θd)
This completes the RG procedure.

.

(4.23)

C. Γ ∈ iR

It is useful to note that beside the equations (2.39) and

(2.43), one can derive an equation for the intensity

II ′ = 2(σ − 1)Re (Γ)|Q|2.

(4.24)

From these equations it follows that in the Γ imaginary
case a number of additional quantities is constant: |Q|,
q5, I. The equation for the phase can be recast as

I∂z arg(Q) = −˜Γq5,
where Γ ≡: i˜Γ, and solved:

arg(Q(z)) = arg(Q(0)) − ˜Γ

• For the TG case the beams B1 = A1 and B3 = A4

that both spinors |ψii (i = 1, 2) are satisfying the mixed

V. THE (PSEUDO)HAMILTONIAN

STRUCTURE OF 4WM

Considering again the form of the spinorial EOM (2.7),
one may notice that (in the TG with µ ∈ R case) the ma-
trix m is antisymmetric, resembling the symplectic ma-
trix used in the Hamiltonian formalism for mechanical
systems. This notice gives rise to the question whether
it is posible to reformulate the 4WM system as a Hamil-
tonian system. In this section one possible approach to
the problem is considered. First the neccessary general
deﬁnitions are given, and then the speciﬁcs of the 4WM
system are discussed.

A. Preliminaries

For the formulation of the Hamiltonian formalism [10]
one needs a phase space in the form of a smooth mani-
fold V and a closed nondegenerate diﬀerential 2-form ˆF
(the ﬁeld-strength form) deﬁned on it, which endows a

{f, g}P B =

D

Xk=1

(∂qk f ∂pk g − ∂qk g∂pk f ).

(5.5)

The Poisson bracket is bilinear, skew-symmetric, and
obeys the Jacobi identity, which is equivalent to the close-
ness of the 2-form ˆF : d ˆF = 0. Later more will be elabo-
rated on this condition.

The dynamics is determined by the choice of the
Hamilton function H on V . The external diﬀerential dH
is a covector ﬁeld (1-form), and ˆJ · dH is the correspond-
ing Hamilton’s vector ﬁeld on V . The Hamilton equation
of motion is speciﬁed by equating the tangent vector ﬁeld
˙~x :≡ ˙xµ∂µ with the Hamilton’s vector ﬁeld:

˙~x = ˆJ · dH.

(5.6)

The Poisson bracket {f, g}P B may now be represented
by the action of the covector df on Hamilton’s vector
ﬁeld ˆJ · dg: {f, g}P B = df ( ˆJ · dg). Therefore, the deriva-
tive of function f in the direction of Hamilton’s vector
ﬁeld ˆJ · dH is in fact {F, H}P B. Hence, the Hamil-
ton equation (5.6) can be written as ˙f = {f, H}P B for
an arbitrary function f . Since the coordinate functions

11

{q1, ...qD, p1, ...pD} form a complete basis, the equations

˙qk = {qk, H}P B = ∂pk H,
˙pk = {pk, H}P B = −∂qk H,

(5.7)

form a closed system. These are the canonical Hamilton
equations of motion.

These matrices are chosen in such a way to satisfy the
three basic requirements: they are antisymmetric, non-
singular (in the matrix sense), and they give the same
EOM

B. Four-wave mixing

In an attempt to cast the 4WM system in the Hamil-

tonian form, one encounters several problems.

First, there is no clear choice of the Hamiltonian
(Hamilton’s function) H(x). It can be an arbitrary real
function of the full set of conserved quantities: H(x) =
h(q(x)). For example, for the general Γ ∈ C, one can
identify three convenient families of Hamiltonians

HQ1,ǫ = q1 + ǫq2,
HQ3λ = λq3 + ¯λ¯q3,
HQ4λ = λq4 + ¯λ¯q4,

(5.8)
where ǫ = ±1 and |λ| = 1. Clearly, these families are
not exhausting all the possible choices, even among the
Hamiltonians that are linear in the regular IOM.

The corresponding symplectic matrices are

J µν
K ∂νHK = f µ(x),

where f µ(x) is the right-hand side of the EOM (1.4):
˙xµ = f µ. The fact that all Hamiltonian structures must
reproduce the same dynamical equations (1.4) means
that for any two structures (HA, JA) and (HB, JB) one
can write:

†∇BAHA = ∇HB,

(5.11)

where †∇BA :≡ RBA · ∇ deﬁnes the cogradient and
RBA :≡ J−1
B JA is the recursion matrix, connecting the
Hamiltonian structures (A) and (B).

Equation (5.11) deﬁnes the mapping from the ﬁrst
Hamiltonian structure (A) to the second one (B).
It
is interesting to assume for a moment that there exists
some function HC whose gradient is the BA-cogradient
of HB. If such a function exists, it will be an integral of
motion:

∂zHC = ˙xµ∂µHC =

B ∂ν HB(J −1

= J µν
= −∂αHBJ αβ

B )µαJ αβ
A ∂βHB ≡ 0.

A ∂βHB =

Thus, the conserved quantity HC , if it exists, is a new
Hamiltonian of the system, and the corresponding sym-
plectic matrix is JC :≡ RABJB = JB J−1
One can continue along the same lines, deﬁning a series
of conserved quantities (”Hamiltonians”) and the corre-
sponding symplectic matrices:

A JB.

HA → HB → HC → ···
ˆJA → ˆJB → ˆJC → ···

(5.12)

The sequence terminates when the Hamiltonians start re-
peating themselves (i.e. they became linear combinations
of the previous members of the sequence). This type of
sequence of the Hamiltonians and the corresponding sym-
plectic matrices is common in the two-dimensional inte-
grable systems. There exists a multi-Hamiltonian prop-
erty of integrable systems, whereby the chain of Hamilto-
nians is (usually) non-terminating, leading to an inﬁnite
set of non-equivalent IOM, and, thus, to the complete
integrability of the system.

In 4WM one expects that all such sequences, if they
exist at all, should terminate after a few terms. For ex-
ample, consider the two structures (HA :≡ HQ1,+1 =
q1 + q2, JA) and (HB :≡ HQ1,−1 = q1 − q2, JB), where JA
and JB are the special cases of (5.9). The recursive ma-
trix is RBA :≡ J−1
B JA = diag(1,−1, 1,−1, 1,−1, 1,−1)

and the basic identity is †∇BAHA = ∇HB. The deﬁni-
tion of the induced HC is
∇HC :≡ †∇BAHB,

(5.13)

and its solution is HC = q1 + q2. Thus HC = HA and
the sequence is periodic: HA → HB → HA → ···.
sponding Poisson bracket:

Each Hamiltonian structure (HK , JK) has the corre-

{f, g}K :≡ (∇f )T JK (∇g).

(5.14)

This bracket is antisymmetric {g, f}K = −{f, g}K, and
can be characterized by the set of basic brackets:

{xµ, xν}K = J µν
K .

(5.15)

However, a bracket so deﬁned does not satisfy the ex-
pected Jacobi identity {f,{g, h}K}K + cyclic ≡ 0. The
tensor of non-Jacobianity measures the violation of the
Jacobi identity:

Ωµνα
(K)

:≡ {{xµ, xν}K, xα}K + cyclic =
= (∂σJ µν

K )J σα + cyclic.

(5.16)

This tensor is essentially the same as the tensor of de-
ﬂection from the Bianchi identity, ω :≡ d ˆF (i.e. ωµνα :≡
∂µFνα + cyclic):

(K) = J µµ′
Ωµνα

K ω(K)µ′ν ′α′ .

K J νν ′

K J αα′

(5.17)

In the case of non-singular J, the Jacobi condition is
equivalent to the Bianchi identity.

In the system at hand, the fact that Ω(K) is not dis-
appearing is the consequence of the non-constancy of µ.
For example, take again the Hamiltonian H = HQ1,+1 =
q1 + q2. Then

J = µE+ + ¯µE−,

(5.18)

From this, one obtains

(5.21)

(5.22)

For example, ωB1,B4, ¯B2 = − 1
µ2 ∂1µ. Thus, the Bianchi
identity is clearly broken, and one can not ﬁnd the po-
tential Aµ(x) such that Fµν (x) is its strength tensor.
One can see the dual nature of the same obstacle, ex-
pressed in terms of the Poisson bracket, in the following
way. The basic brackets are

(cid:8)B1, ¯B3(cid:9)P B = µ,
(cid:8)B2, ¯B4(cid:9)P B = ¯µ.
ΩB1 ¯B3B2 = −¯µ ¯∂4µ.

and one non-vanishing component of Ω is

(5.23)

(5.24)

The full list of non-vanishing components of Ω is given
in the Appendix F. Thus, the Poisson bracket is not
self-consistent: one can not apply it consecutively on the
phase space without running into inconsistencies. This
is the second, and much more serious problem with the
presented approach to casting the 4WM system in the
Hamiltonian form. One can say that the 4WM system
has a pseudo-Hamiltonian structure.

If all components of ω were zero, one would be able
to ﬁnd the potential functions Aµ of strength tensor
Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ. Then the system could be formu-
lated as the Lagrangian one, with the action functional
S(z1, z2) :≡ R z2
dzL(x, ˙x), where the Lagrangian func-

tion is

z1

L(x, ˙x) :≡ ˙xµAµ(x) − H(x).

(5.25)

The Euler-Lagrange EOM corresponding to this La-
grangian are the Hamilton equations (5.6). The elements
of the Lagrangian formalism are provided in Appendix G.
Since ω 6= 0, one may search for the solutions in the

form

Fµν = f (∂µAν − ∂νAµ),

(5.26)

13

which leads to

(∂αf )Fµν + cyclic = f ωαβγ.

(5.27)

The direct consequence of this equation is

∂α ln f =

1

2D − 2

(5.28)

(5.29)

where φ = arg(µ).

C. The Γ ∈ R case

If φ is constant (i.e. Γ ∈ R), the solution of Eq. (5.29)

is f = 1/|µ|. Then

˜Fµν = −¯ν (E+)µν − ν (E−)µν ,

Note that if in the above expression M(z) is directly re-
placed by |µ(x)|, the obtained corresponding variation
equations are wrong.
In the Γ ∈ R case the set of IOM is enlarged by the ”ex-
ceptional” IOM {w1−6} (and their complex conjugates),
and one can construct some additional families of (linear
in IOM) Hamiltonians (ǫ = ±1, |λ| = 1, |θ| = 1):

HW 1,ǫ = w1 + ǫσw2,
HW 3,λ = λw3 + ¯λ ¯w3,
HW 5,λ = λw5 + ¯λ ¯w5,
HW 4,λθ =

(λw4 + ¯λ ¯w4 + θw6 + ¯θ ¯w6) .

Aµ = −

1

2h¯ν (E+)µν + ν (E−)µνi xν ,

(5.30)

with ν = exp(iφ) (not to be confused with the index ν).
To construct the action for this case one has to go
one step back. The factorization of f = 1/|µ(x)| from
Fµν is equivalent to the introduction of a new time pa-
rameter θ(z) :≡ R z
0 dz′M(z′) + const. into EOM, where
M(z) :≡ |µ (x(z))| is the on-shell value of |µ(x)|. Thus

˜Fµν

The constant ”ﬁeld-strength” form ˆ˜F is closed, and its

These matrices JW ··· do not depend on µ, i.e. they are
constant. So, their Poisson brackets satisfy the Jacobi
identity. This is the case not only for the real, but also
for the complex coupling Γ. However, the Hamiltonians
(5.33) are not IOM for the complex Γ.

To sum up the results, for a general Γ two types of

pseudo-Hamitonian structures exist:

• (HQ, JQ): Hamiltonians HQ are linear in regular
IOM. They are conserved quantities in general case, but
the corresponding ﬁeld-strength forms ˆFQ are non-closed

d ˆFQ 6= 0. The defect of this type is the non-closeness of
its symplectic structure.
• (HW , JW ): Hamiltonians HW are linear in excep-
tional (Γ ∈ R) IOM. The corresponding ﬁeld-strength
forms ˆFW are constant and closed in general case. The
defect of this type of structure is the nonconservation of
W -Hamiltonians (in general, Γ ∈ C case).
In the case of real coupling, both defects disappear,
the ﬁrst one after rescaling z → θ(z), and the second
one because W -Hamiltonians become constant. Then
one can construct a consistent Hamiltonian structure for
the 4WM system.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the algebraic structures of the 4WM equa-

tions in PR crystals were studied.

First, the form of the equations of motion was used to
group the basic ﬁelds into two doublets, leading to the
new form of EOM, resembling the Dirac equation in one
dimension (”time”), with the ﬁeld-dependent mass ma-
trix. This lead to the simple procedure for ﬁnding the
complete set of ”regular” (i.e. present in the complex Γ
case) integrals of motion. Then an alternative but closely
related procedure, based on the Lax pair approach, was
used to check the completeness of the obtained set of
IOM. Both procedures were extended to the special case
Γ ∈ R, to obtain an additional (”exceptional”) set of
IOM.
Afterwards, the concept of symmetries of the ”regular”
IOM was deﬁned (the I-symmetries), and the Lie algebras
(and groups) corresponding to the linear I-symmetries
were found. These are the su(2) symmetry for the trans-
mission gratings and the su(1, 1) symmetry for the reﬂec-
tion gratings. The initial doublets of basic ﬁelds, which
were introduced as a convenience for more compact cal-
culations, turned out to be the fundamental (i.e. spinor)
representation of those symmetry algebras. Also, the Lax
matrices, constructed from these basic spinors, transform
in the regular way, i.e. they form the adjoint representa-
tion of the I-symmetries.

In the special case Γ ∈ R the number of IOM increases,
so only the subset of ”regular” I-symmetries survives.
This is to be expected, since the I-symmetries now have
to satisfy a larger set of constraints than in the general
(Γ ∈ C) case.
In the second part of the paper another type of sym-
metries was considered, the symmetries of EOM (the E-
symmetries). The corresponding symmetry algebras are
the products of several abelian factors (one noncompact
∼ R1, and two compact ∼ u(1)) and of one su(1, 1) factor
(for both geometries). The action of these symmetries on
the regular IOM was studied and a special kind of N¨other
theorem is found to be valid here.

In the special case Γ ∈ R the number of independent
EOM gets smaller, leading to the increase in the number
of E-symmetries. This is clearly the opposite behavior
to the case of I-symmetries. Further study is necessary
to clarify the relation between the ”regular” and ”excep-
tional” cases. At the end of this part, the action of the
E-symmetries on the I-symmetries was considered (in the
”regular” case). The non-abelian factor of E-symmetries
commutes with the I-symmetries, and the two u(1) fac-
tors act as rotations in the 1 − 2 plane of I-symmetries.
As a short excursion from the algebraic orientation of
the paper, Section IV is devoted to the solutions of EOM
in two ”exceptional” cases: Γ ∈ R and Γ ∈ iR. In both
cases it is relatively straightforward to obtain the gen-
eral solutions (two methods for Γ ∈ R were presented
and one for Γ ∈ iR), but satisfying the boundary con-
ditions characteristic of 4WM geometries required more
attention.

In the last Section one possible approach to the Hamil-
tonian formulation of the 4WM system was discussed.
The problems that occurred in that program were two-
fold: the non-uniqueness of the choice of the Hamiltonian
(Hamilton’s function), and the non-closeness of the ﬁeld-
strength 2-form. The ﬁrst problem leads to the recog-
nition of the multi-Hamiltonian nature of the 4WM sys-
tem, and is not really a problem. It is just the type of the
”gauge-symmetry” of EOM. The second problem, how-
ever, is the real obstacle to the fulﬁllment of the program.
The structure of this obstacle is topological (the violation
of the Jacobi and Bianchi identities). This was studied
for one speciﬁc ”gauge” (the choice of the Hamiltonian),
and a special circumstance when this obstacle can be re-
moved was found, essentially corresponding to the Γ ∈ R
case.
The same Γ ∈ R case was then treated in a diﬀerent
way, leading to the discovery of even bigger space of pos-
sible Hamiltonians. The topological obstacle is absent in
this case, and nothing prevents a full consistent applica-
tion of the Hamilton formalism, and identiﬁcation of the
corresponding Hamiltonian action of the system.

Future work: The presented work contains several

topics that deserve future attention.

Questions pertaining to the general class of dynamic
systems: Clarifying the freedom of choice of Hamilto-
nian function among IOM; Studying properties of E-
symmetries upon the local (i.e. x-dependent) scalings
of the dynamic vector ﬁeld ~F ; Finding classes of equiva-
lency of the symplectic form ˆJ (under such scalings) that
have the same structure of the tensor of non-Jacobianity
ω; etc.

Questions related to the 4WM system in particular:
Full relation between the Γ ∈ R and Γ ∈ C E-symmetries;
Explicit resolution of boundary conditions in Γ ∈ C case;
Extending the theory to multiple gratings; etc.
The last question is particularly intriguing. Even in

15

the case of single gratings, 4WM EOM possess rich al-
gebraic structure. However, the writing of gratings in a
photorefractive crystal is a dynamic holographic process,
and more than one grating can coexist simultaneously in
the same region of the crystal. EOM then contain terms
coming from diﬀerent types of gratings, and the analysis
should be much more involved.

In the general case of complex Γ the factor µ is non-
constant (with respect to z), and some of the parameters
ξ have to be set to zero: ξ1 = ξ3 = ξ5 = ξ7 = 0. However,
if Γ is real, the phase factor ν:≡ exp(iargµ) is constant,
and one may redeﬁne the time variable z → θ, to absorb
the non-constant absolute value |µ(z)|. In eﬀect this per-
mits the full set of non-zero ξ in the above matrix C (with
the replacement µ → ν).
Let us consider the general case. The presence of
four non-zero ξ parameters indicates the existence of four
IOM:

IOMξ2 = ¯α(I1 + σI3) = ¯αq1,
IOMξ8 = β¯γ(I2 + σI4) = β¯γq2,
IOMξ4 = ¯αβ( ¯B1B4 − ¯B3B2) = ¯αβ ¯q3,
IOMξ6 = σ¯γ( ¯B4B1 − ¯B2B3) = σ¯γq3,

These integrals are the already known ”regular” IOM.
Only q4 is not obtained in this way. It will be obtained
in the next subsection, with a diﬀerent choice of L.
In the Γ ∈ R case, there are eight free parameters (ξ)
and there should be eight IOM. The ﬁrst four of them
are the ”regular” ones {q1, q2, q3, ¯q3}, and the additional
four are:

IOMξ1 = |α|2(ν ¯B1B3 − ¯ν ¯B1B3) = |α|2w1,
IOMξ7 = σ|γ|2(ν ¯B4B2 − ¯νB4 ¯B2) = −|γ|2w2,
IOMξ3 = ¯αγ(ν ¯B1B2 + σ¯ν ¯B3B4) = −σ ¯αγw3,
IOMξ5 = −σα¯γ ¯w3.

¯Ψ(cid:11)hΨ|B, where
Now search for L in the form L = A(cid:12)(cid:12)
A and B are some constant matrices (diﬀerent from the
ones in the previous subsection). Then
∂zL = ANA−1L + LB−1N TB,

(B11)
and the requirement that L satisﬁes the Lax-type evolu-
tion equation has the form:
B−1N TB = −ANA−1,

i.e.

APPENDIX D: ORDERED EXPONENTIAL

In this appendix some general properties of the matrix

U(z) are discussed.

The basic 4WM EOM (2.7) has a formal solution

|ψi(z)i = U(z)|ψi(0)i ,

where U(z) satisﬁes the initial value problem

(D1)

(D2)

N TC = −CN ,

(B13)
where, again, C :≡ BA. The solution to this condition is

∂zU(z) = m(z)U(z),

U(0) = 1.

(B14)

In the Γ ∈ C case one has to set ξ2 = ξ8 = ξ7 = ξ4 = 0
and the remaining ξ parameters give rise to the following
four ”regular” IOM:
IOMξ1 ≡ 0,
IOMξ3 ≡ 0,
IOMξ5 = αγ(B1B2 + σB3B4) = αγq4,
IOMξ6 = αγq4.

(B15)

The Γ ∈ R case has additional w integrals:
3 ) = αw4,
2 ) = βγw6,

IOMξ2 = α(¯νB2
IOMξ4 = βγ(σ¯νB2
IOMξ8 = αβ(¯νB1B4 − νB3B2) = αβw5,
IOMξ7 = γw5.

1 + σνB2
4 + νB2

(B16)

In this way, the full sets of ”regular” (q-set) and ”excep-
tional” (w-set) IOMs are reconstructed. The presence of
the arbitrary complex constants α, β and γ in the pro-
cedure indicates that there are no additional IOM of the
bilinear type.

One can write the formal solution to this equation in the
form

U(z) :≡(cid:18)exp(cid:18)Z z

0

dz′m(z′)(cid:19)(cid:19)+

(D3)

which is called the (Path) Ordered Exponential (OE). The
notion of ordering is referring here to the right-to-left
multiplication of the factors in the deﬁnition of OE:

(D4)

i.e. one alternates the inﬁnitesimal integrations (along
the path between the z′ = 0 and z′ = z) and exponenti-
ations of, in such a way obtained, inﬁnitesimal matrices.
OE is an entirely diﬀerent object from the ordinary ma-
0 dz′m(z′)), where the whole inte-
gration along the path is performed ﬁrst, and then only
one exponentiation executed on this integrated matrix.
The source of the diﬀerence is in the non-commutativity
of the matrices m(z) evaluated at diﬀerent points.

Uij(z) = u11 exp(iωijz),

(E3)

The methods to evaluate OE are frequently non-exact:
one may easily prove that the knowledge of U(z) for arbi-
trary m(z) is equivalent to the knowledge of the solution
to the Schr¨odinger equation for an arbitrary complex po-
tential (and this is known to be a non-solvable problem).
However, in the cases when m(z) has one of the several
special forms, the exact solution for U(z) can be found.
Two such cases are encountered in this work:

• for Γ ∈ R the matrix m(z) is proportional to the con-
stant matrix ˜m(z) = (cid:18) 0
0 (cid:19), and all commutators
−¯ν

[m(z), m(z′)] are equal to zero. Thus, OE reduces to the
ordinary exponential, and the result is displayed in Eq.
(4.11).

σν

• for Γ ∈ iR the matrix m(z) has the raising and the
lowering components that oscillate with the opposite fre-
quencies Ω. The Appendix E gives one possible way to
obtain U(z) for such an m(z).

In the general case, the OE U(z) satisﬁes several sim-

ple identities, induced by the properties of m(z):

• From the tracelessness of m(z) follows the unimodal-

ity condition det U(z) = 1 (∀z):

(D5)

• From the membership of m(z) in the Lie alge-

transformations, these equations are the constraints on
the Hamiltonian dynamics of system:

κµ :≡ pµ − Aµ(x).

(G6)

Constraints obtained from the contact transformations
are called the primary constraints,
implying that
there may be some additional constraints in the system
(all these additional constraints are called secondary
constraints). Hamiltonian systems with constraints are
treated by the Dirac method which outlines are given in
the rest of this Appendix.

For the speciﬁc system at hand, the naively deﬁned
Hamiltonian (G5) has the arbitrary weighted terms pro-
portional to primary constraints:

H = V + κµ ˙xµ ≃ V

(G7)

(F1)

Its unique (non-arbitrary) part is called the Canonical
Hamiltonian Hc = V . For the further purposes, one
needs the (temptative) Total Hamiltonian:

APPENDIX G: LAGRANGE FORMULATION OF

GENERALIZED HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS

H ′

T = Hc + κµvµ.

(G8)

1. From the singular Lagrangian to the generalized

Hamiltonian dynamics

The singular Lagrangian (µ ∈ 1, D):

L = Aµ(x) ˙xµ − V (x),

(G1)

generates the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion:

Eµ :≡

∂L
∂xµ −

d
dt

∂L
∂ ˙xµ = Fµν ˙xν − ∂µV = 0,

(G2)

where Fµν :≡ ∂µAν − ∂νAµ is the tensor of the ”ﬁeld
strength”. If it is nonsingular (det F 6= 0; possible only
for even D), its inverse, the tensor of symplectic struc-
ture J :≡ F−1 can be deﬁned. Then Eq. (G2) have the
form of the generalized Hamilton equations:

˙xµ = J µν ∂νV.

(G3)

To initiate the Hamilton formulation, one starts with the
deﬁnition of canonical momenta

pµ :≡

∂L
∂ ˙xµ = Aµ(x),

and of the (naively deﬁned) Hamiltonian function

H :≡ pµ ˙xµ − L.

(G4)

(G5)

The deﬁnitions of momenta (G4) are supposed to be
(non-singular) contact transformations replacing veloc-
ities ˙xµ by the momenta pν, thus allowing (by inversion)
to express the velocities ˙xµ in terms of the momenta
pµ. Here, however, these equations are singular: the ve-
locities do not ﬁgure (at all) on their right-hand-sides
(RHS). Thus, instead of being the (successful) contact

where vµ are the Lagrange multipliers, for this mo-
ment taken to be arbitrary functions of time z. The
prime on H ′
T denotes the temptative nature of this quan-
tity: once when (and if) the Lagrange multipliers are
determined (i.e.
replaced with suitable functions over
phase space), this quantity will be replaced by symbol
HT . One can not know apriory what values will vs ac-
quire. Instead, the (Dirac’s) constraint analysis has to be
performed to determine the full set of constraints in the
system and then to classify the constraints as either the
ﬁrst class (ones that commute in a weak sense with all
other constraints) or the second class (ones that are
not of the ﬁrst class). Then, the Lagrange multipliers
standing next to the primary constraints of the second
class will be determined as a speciﬁc functions on the
phase space, while the Lagrange multipliers correspond-
ing to the primary constraints of the ﬁrst class will stay
undetermined. Presence of the second class constraints
leads to the reduction of the phase space, while the ﬁrst
class constraint generate the gauge transformations (on
the phase space).

The phase space Γ = {(x, p)|∀x, p ∈ RD} possesses the

Poisson bracket:

{f, g}P B :≡

∂f
∂xµ

∂g
∂pµ −

∂f
∂pµ

∂g
∂xµ .

(G9)

The evolution of any function f on the phase space Γ is
deﬁned by

df
dt

= {f, H ′

T}P B.

(G10)

The consistency equations of the primary constraints

dκµ
dt

= {κµ, H ′

T}P B = −∂µV + Fµν vν = 0,

(G11)

19

can be solved if F = (Fµν ) is non-singular, giving the
ﬁnal expression for the Lagrange multipliers:

2. When the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics has

the Lagrangian formulation?

vµ = J µν ∂νV,

(G12)

If F is singular, some components of the RHS of Eq.
(G11) can not be solved for v, and one has to deﬁne
the secondary constrains (and then to check their con-
sistency, and so on). In this work, only the case of non-
singular F is discused.

Here, all primary constrains are of the second class, i.e.
each of them has (at least) one other constraint that does
not commute (in Poisson bracket sense) with it. This is
easy to see from

{κµ, κν}P B = Fµν (x),

(G13)

and the non-singularity of the matrix F. Constraints
of the second class reduce the phase space of the system
(whereas the ﬁrst class constraints, if they existed, would
be the gauge symmetries of the corresponding action).

To successfully perform the reduction of phase space,
one needs to replace the Poisson brackets with the Dirac
brackets, deﬁned as:

{f, g}DB :≡ {f, g}P B − {f, κµ}P B J µν {κν, g}P B .
(G14)

With respect to this structure, the connections κ are con-
stant, i.e. every function f (x, p) on the phase space com-
mutes with them:

{f, κµ}DB = 0.

(G15)

On this way, one can consistently work with the reduced
phase space Γ∗ :≡ Γ/{κ = 0} = {(x, p = A(x))|∀x ∈
RD}. The Poisson bracket on this space is deﬁned as

{f, g}P B on Γ∗ :≡ {f, g}DB on Γ|κ=0 .

(G16)

Since the coordinates xµ do not commute with respect

to the Dirac bracket

{xµ, xν}DB = J µν ,

(G17)

on the space Γ, their Poisson bracket on Γ∗ are non-
vanishing, too:

{xµ, xν}P B on Γ∗ = J µν|Γ∗ .

(G18)

From non-singularity of the tensor J one can conclude
that the half of coordinates x can be used as the real
coordinates on the Γ∗, and rest of them are the corre-
sponding conjugated momenta.

One can turn any even-dimensional generalized Hamil-
tonian system (given by Eqs (G3)) into the Lagrangian
(G1) iﬀ:

a) Matrix J is nonsingular, so one can deﬁne its inverse

F, and

the Darboux condition d ˆF = 0.

b) 2-form ˆF :≡ 1
2 Fµν dxµ ∧ dxν is closed, i.e. satisﬁes
The two conditions are (in a simple connected region
U of the phase space: π1(U ) = 0) suﬃcient to assure the
existence of ”potentials” ~A = Aµdxµ, such that ˆF is ex-
act 2-form ˆF = d ~A (and, therefore, closed). Under these
conditions the potentials are:

Aµ(x) =

1

2Z x

x0

Fµν (y)dyν,

(G19)

where the integration is along any path connecting points
x0 and x, which belongs to the domain U , and x0 is the
point where Aµ(x0) = 0.
2 Z x2

The action has the form:

The ﬁrst term is the weighted surface integral over the

it lives only on the line that
connects the points x1 and x2.

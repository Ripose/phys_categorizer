Abstract

We propose to employ the quasiisotropic metamaterial (QIMM) slab to create a polarization

insensitive lens, in which both E- and H-polarized waves exhibit the same refocusing eﬀect. For

shallow incident angles, the QIMM slab will provide some degree of refocusing in the same manner

as an isotropic negative index material. The refocusing eﬀect allows us to introduce the ideas

of paraxial beam focusing and phase compensation by the QIMM slab. On the basis of angular

spectrum representation, a formalism describing paraxial beams propagating through a QIMM slab

is presented. Because of the negative phase velocity in the QIMM slab, the inverse Gouy phase

shift and the negative Rayleigh length of paraxial Gaussian beam are proposed. We found that the

phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in vacuum can be compensated by that caused

by the inverse Gouy phase shift in the QIMM slab. If certain matching conditions are satisﬁed,

the intensity and phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image

plane.

INTRODUCTION

About forty years ago, Veselago ﬁrstly introduced the concept of left-handed material

(LHM) in which both the permittivity ε and the permeability µ are negative [1]. He predicted

that LHM would have unique and potentially interesting properties, such as the negative

refraction index, the reversed Doppler shift and the backward Cerenkov radiation. Veselago

pointed out that electromagnetic waves incident on a planar interface between a regular

material and a LHM will undergo negative refraction. Hence a LHM planar slab can act as

a lens and focus waves from a point source. LHM did not receive much attention as it only

existed in a conceptual form. After the ﬁrst experimental observation of negative refraction

using a metamaterial composed of split ring resonators (SRR) [2, 3], the study of such

materials has received increasing attention over the last few years. While negative refraction

is most easily visualized in an isotropic metamaterial [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], negative refraction can

also be realized in photonic crystals [7, 8, 9, 10] and anisotropic metamaterials [11, 12, 13,

14, 15, 16] have also been reported.

Recently, Pendry extended Veslago’s analysis and further predicted that a LHM slab

can amplify evanescent waves and thus behaves like a perfect lens [17]. He proposed that

the amplitudes of evanescent waves from a near-ﬁeld object could be restored at its image.

Therefore, the spatial resolution of the superlens can overcome the diﬀraction limit of con-

ventional imaging systems and reach the subwavelength scale. The great research interests

were initiated by the revolutionary concept. More recently, the anisotropic metamaterials

have proved to be good candidates for slab lens application [18, 19, 20, 21]. Although the

focusing is imperfect, the substantial ﬁeld intensity enhancement can readily be observed.

In these cases, the anisotropic metamaterials under consideration are characterized by a

hyperbiloid wave-vector surface, and the focusing is restricted to either E- or H-polarized

radiation. The recent development in quasiisotropic metamaterial (QIMM) oﬀer further op-

portunities to extend the previous work and further predict that both E- and H-polarized

waves can be refocused.

The main purpose of the present work is to construct a polarization insensitive lens

by a QIMM slab. For shallow incident angles the QIMM slab will provide some degree

of refocusing in the same manner as an isotropic negative index material. We show that

both E- and H-polarized waves can exhibit the same refocusing eﬀect. Starting from the

representation of plane-wave angular spectrum, we derive the propagation of paraxial beams

2

in the QIMM slab. Our formalism permits us to introduce ideas for beam focusing and

phase compensation of paraxial beams by using the QIMM slab. Because of the negative

anisotropic parameters, the inverse Gouy phase shift and negative Rayleigh length in the

QIMM slab are proposed. As an example, we obtain the analytical description for a Gaussian

beam propagating through a QIMM slab. We ﬁnd that the phase diﬀerence caused by the

Gouy phase shift in isotropic RHM can be compensated by that caused by the inverse Gouy

phase shift in the QIMM slab. If certain matching conditions are satisﬁed, the intensity and

phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image plane.

II. POLARIZATION INSENSITIVE METAMATERIAL

Before we consider the polarization insensitive lens, we ﬁrst analyze what is the QIMM.

For anisotropic materials, one or both of the permittivity and permeability are second-rank

tensors. In the following we assume that both the permittivity and permeability tensors are

simultaneously diagonalizable:

εx 0 0

ε = 



where εi and µi (i = x, y, z) are the permittivity and permeability constants in the principal

coordinate system.

Following the standard procedure, we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld

E(r, t) = Re[E(r) exp(

iωt)] and B(r, t) = Re[B(r) exp(

iωt)] of angular frequency ω

be represented by a three-dimensional surface in wave-vector space. This surface is known

as the normal surface and consists of two shells. Under the condition of Eq. (5), we can ﬁnd

E- and H-polarized waves have the same wave-vector surface. Thus the anisotropic medium

also be regard as QIMM [23, 24]. Clearly, we can ﬁnd the dispersion surface has following

two types: ellipsoid, single-sheeted hyperboloid and double-sheeted hyperboloid, as show in

relation:

FIG. 2: The circle and hyperbola represent the dispersion relations of isotropic and quasiisotropic

media, respectively. The incident wave vector k is parallel to the Poynting vector SI in vacuum.

Because of the anisotropy in QIMM, ST must lie normal to the frequency contour. The wave vector

undergoes a negative refraction, while the energy ﬂow undergoes positive refraction.

Now, a question is easily answered whether E- and H-polarized exhibit the same propa-

gation character. We choose the z axis to be normal to the interface, the x and y axes locate

at in the plane of the interface. The z-component of the wave vector can be found by the

solution of Eq. (6), which yields

Combining Eq. (10) and (13) we can easily ﬁnd that E- and H- polarized waves have the

same refraction properties.

Now we are in the position to study the negative refraction in the QIMM. Unlike in

isotropic media, the Poynting vector in The QIMM is neither parallel nor antiparallel to

the wave vector, but rather makes either an acute or an obtuse angle with respect to the

wave vector. In general, to distinguish the positive and negative refraction in quasiisotropic

media, we must calculate the direction of the Poynting vector with respect to the wave

vector. Positive refraction means qx

ST > 0, and negative refraction means qx

ST < 0 [24].

The negative refraction phenomenon is one of the most interesting peculiar properties of

the QIMM. We can see that the refracted waves will be determined by µz for E-polarized

incident waves and εz for H-polarized incident waves.

Because of the importance of refocusing eﬀect, we are intersted the two types of QIMM,

which can formed from the combinations of material parameter tensor elements.

As noted above, the Poynting vector will exhibit the negative refraction in the two types

of QIMM. The negative refraction is the important eﬀect responsible for the slab lens. To

simplify the proceeding analyses, we will focus our attention on the QIMM with ellipsoid

III. THE PARAXIAL MODEL OF BEAM PROPAGATION

In this section, Let us examine the polarization insensitive eﬀect in paraxial regime. As

depicted in Fig. 3, the QIMM slab in region 2 is surrounded by vacuum in region 1 and

region 3. From the ray tracing picture of Fig. 3, we can easily ﬁnd that there is a strong

astigmatism eﬀect in the image plane.

manner as an isotropic negative index material, as shown in Fig. 4. Hence the interesting

property allow us introduce the idea to construct a anisotropic matamaterial slab lens in

paraxial beam region.

Equation (3) can be conveniently solved by employing the Fourier transformations, so

the complex amplitude in RHM and LHM can be conveniently expressed as

From Eqs. (24) and (25) we can ﬁnd that the ﬁeld of paraxial beams in QIMM can be written

in the similar way to that in regular material, while the sign of the eﬀective refraction index

is reverse.

IV. BEAM FOCUSING BY POLARIZATION INSENSITIVE LENS

The previous section we have understand both E- and H-polarized beams have the same

propagation character in QIMM slab. Hence we do not wish involve in the trouble to

discuss the focusing eﬀect of two polarized waves.

In this section we will investigate the

analytical description for E-polarized beam with a boundary Gaussian distribution. This

example allows us to describe the refocusing features of beam propagation in QIMM slab.

The beam will pass the interfaces z = a and z = a + d before it reaches the image plane

z = a + b + d. To be uniform throughout the following analysis, we introduce diﬀerent
coordinate transformations z∗

i (i = 1, 2, 3) in the three regions, respectively. First we want

to explore the ﬁeld in region 1. Without any loss of generality, we assume that the input

waist locates at the object plane z = 0. The fundamental Gaussian spectrum distribution

can be written in the form

We are now in a position to investigate the ﬁeld in region 2. In fact, the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst

A further important point should be noted that we have introduce the negative Rayleigh

length. The inherent physics underlying the negative Rayleigh length is the waves undergo

a negative phase velocity in the QIMM slab. As we will see the following, the negative

Rayleigh length will give rise to the corresponding reverse Gouy phase shift.

Finally we want to explore the ﬁeld in region 3. The ﬁeld in the second boundary can be

easily obtained from Eq. (31) under choosing z = a + d. Substituting the ﬁeld into Eq. (20),

the angular spectrum distribution can be written as

that generally the Gaussian beam is astigmatic.

Up to now, the ﬁelds are determined explicitly in the three regions. Comparing Eq. (31),

longer remain Gaussian. We take the image position z = a + d + b to be the place of the

second focusing waist. For the purpose of illustration, the intensity distribution in object

plane is plotted in Fig. 5a. In general, the shape of intensity distribution is distorted in

image plane as shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5c. Careful evaluation of Eq. (34) reveal that the

secret underlying the intensity distortion is the anisotropic diﬀraction.

Next, the most obvious question is whether the intensity distribution at the object plane

can be completely reconstructed at the image plane. In the next step, we want to explore

the matching condition of focusing. We can easily obtain the place of the focusing waist by
choosing z∗
the astigmatic eﬀect, the beam waists should locate the same place, namely z∗

i = 0. Let us assume the incident beam waist locates at plane z = 0. To eliminate

3y. Using

12

these criterions, the matching condition for focusing can be written as

εyµz(a + b) + σ√εxµyd = 0,

εx = εy.

(36)

Under the focusing matching condition, the intensity distribution at the object plane can be

completely reconstructed at the image plane Fig. 5d. A further point should be noted is that

the thickness of the QIMM slab should satisfy the relation d > σεyµza/√εxµy, otherwise

there is neither an internal nor an external focus.

V. PHASE COMPENSATION BY POLARIZATION INSENSITIVE LENS

In this section, we attempt to investigate the matching condition for phase compensation.

In isotropic LHM, plane waves can propagate with negative phase velocity directed opposite

to the direction of Poynting vector. Hence the phase diﬀerence can be compensated by the

LHM slab [1, 17, 24]. However, the negative tensor parameters associated with anisotropic

medium provides a wealth of opportunities for observing and exploiting negative phase-

velocity behavior.

Eq. (28) give the phase

First let us investigate the phase distribution in region 1. A more rigorous calculation of

that caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in the QIMM slab. The phase fronts of Gaussian beam

We should mention that there are two diﬀerent radius of curvature, R2x and R2y , that

characterize the beam undergo diﬀerent diﬀraction eﬀects in the direction of x and y axes,

respectively.

The radius of curvatures are given by Eq. (44). The Gouy phase shift in QIMM is given by

Eq. (45). The anisotropic eﬀect result in the two radius of curvatures keep their diﬀerence

even if the Rayleigh lengths are equal.

It is known that an electromagnetic beam propagating through a focus experiences an

additional π phase shift with respect to a plane wave. This phase anomaly was discovered

by Gouy in 1890 and has since been referred to as the Gouy phase shift [22, 29]. It should be

mentioned that there exists an eﬀect of accumulated Gouy phase shift when a beam passing

through an optical system with positive index [30, 31, 32]. While in the QIMM slab system

we expect that the phase diﬀerence caused by Gouy phase shift can be compensated by that

caused by the inverse Gouy shift in the QIMM slab.

We might suspect whether the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in vacuum

can be compensated by that caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in QIMM slab. To obtain

the better physical picturer, the schematic distribution of phase fronts are plotted in Fig. 6.

The phase fronts of a focused Gaussian beam are plotted with solid lines, and the phase

fronts of a perfect spherical wave with the dashed lines. The phase diﬀerence on the optical

axis is caused by the Gouy phase shift. The inherent secret underlying the reverse Gouy

phase shift in the QIMM slab is the waves undergo a negative phase velocity.

Let us investigate what happens if we consider the phase diﬀerence caused by Gouy shift.

Under the focusing matching conditions, the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase

The ﬁrst and third Equations dictate the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy shift in regions

1 and 3, respectively. The second equation denotes the phase diﬀerence caused by the inverse

Gouy phase shift in QIMM slab. Subsequent calculations of Eq. (46) show

∆Φ1 + ∆Φ2 + ∆Φ3 = 0.

(47)

This means that the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in vaccum can be

compensated by that caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in QIMM slab. Therefore the

condition for phase compensation can be simply written as

(a + b)k0 + σ√εyµxdk0 = 0.

(48)

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (48) are the phase deference caused by the plane wave in vacuum,

and the other term is the phase deference caused by the plane wave in QIMM slab. For the

purpose of illustration, the phase distribution in object plane is plotted in Fig. 7a. Generally,

the phase distributions in image plane is distorted as shown in Fig. 7b and Fig. 7c. As

mentioned above, the phase distortion is caused by the eﬀect of anisotropic diﬀraction.

Now an interesting question naturally arises: whether the matching conditions of focusing

and the phase compensation can be satisﬁed simultaneously. Clearly, if we seek a solution

satisfying Eqs. (36) and (48), the only possibility is

εx = εy,

εyµz = 1.

(49)

Under the matching conditions, the intensity and phase distributions at the object plane

can be completely reconstructed at the image plane.

It should be mentioned that, for the QIMM slab with double-sheeted hyperboloid wave-

vector surface, both E- and H-polarized beams can also exhibit the same intensity and

phase reconstructed eﬀect. Because of the positive phase velocity embedded in this type of

QIMM, the paraxial beam will experience the positive Rayleigh distance and Gouy phase

shift. Therefore the accumulated phase delay eﬀect give rise to a large phase deference

between the object and image planes.

VI. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have proposed how to employ the QIMM slab creat a polarization in-

sensitive lens by the QIMM slab, in which both E- and H-polarized waves exhibit the same

refocusing eﬀect. For shallow incident angles the QIMM slab will provide some degree of

refocusing in the same manner as an isotropic negative index material. We have investigated

the focusing and phase compensation of paraxial beams by the QIMM slab. We have in-

troduced the concepts of inverse Gouy phase shift and negative Rayleigh length of paraxial

beams in QIMM. We have shown that the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift

in vacuum can be compensated by that caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in the QIMM

slab. If certain matching conditions are satisﬁed, the intensity and phase distributions at

object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image plane. In spite of potential diﬃ-

culties in the road to a practical polarization insensitive lens, the essential physics described

in this paper may have been observed in a diﬀerent system. An extremely promising ma-

terial has been previously explored in certain designs of photonic crystals, which can be

eﬀectively modelled with anisotropic permittivity and permeability tensors [33, 34, 35]. In

spite of some potential technical diﬃculties, we wish the essential physics described in this

paper will provide reference in the road to construct the polarization insensitive lens.

Optimal conditions for light pulses coherence transformation in thin
nonlinear media

M. Karelin, A. Lazaruk ∗

ABSTRACT

Via solution of appropriate variational problem it is shown that light beams with Gaussian spatial proﬁle and

suﬃciently short duration provide maximal destruction of global coherence under nonlinear self-modulation.

Keywords: nonlinear phase self-modulation, controllable coherence degradation.

INTRODUCTION

Earlier it was demonstrated,1 that self-modulation of light ﬁelds in a nonlinear medium can serve as a
convenient tool for controllable coherence manipulation. Process of local interaction of coherent incident ﬁeld
(r)e(t) with “optically thin” nonlinear layer, being described by Raman-Nath approximation, causes
Ein(r, t) =
diﬀerent nonstationary phase shifts

where the phase is determined by media parameters and intensity of input light in every particular point r
of a beam cross-section. The resulting degradation of spatial coherence can be treated as a decay of initially
single-mode (but nonuniform) radiation into a number of mutually incoherent, orthogonal modes. Such a process
imitates the action of moving phase diﬀuser and can in principle be used for speckle-noise reduction in experiments
with short light pulses.

The main characteristic of output ﬁeld in discussed process is an overall degree of coherence

— pulse energy (nonlinear medium is supposed to be absorbtionless). The value (2) determines the contrast
of all interference phenomena (including speckles) and it is closely connected with coherent-mode structure of
optical ﬁelds. Modal treatment is an analogue of Karhunen-Lo´eve transformation, and the main parameter of
such approach — eﬀective number of modes — is Nef f = 1/µ (see Ref. 2, 3 for further details).

2 OPTIMISATION OVER SPATIAL BEAM DISTRIBUTION

The consideration in paper1 was carried out for the model of cubic nonlinearity with exponential relaxation and
speckled input ﬁeld. Maximal coherence destruction there is achieved in the ultimate case of inertial interaction
with inﬁnite memory

Z
For this limit the value (2) does not depend on temporal shape of input pulse, and every initial ﬁeld is equivalent
to rectangular pulse of duration T :

The interaction with inﬁnite memory provides maximal total phase shift, so one can expect, that the case (4)
will result in maximal coherence destruction for any input beam. Hence the main aim of the present analysis is
(r), what can be done
to optimise the transformation (1), (4) over possible spatial distributions of initial ﬁeld
via solving variational problem on minimum of double integral

So far the above two functionals do depend on incident intensity only, the task can be simpliﬁed by transition

Function P (I) has a meaning of measure of contribution into these integrals due to ﬁeld points of given inten-
sity. In particular important case of axially symmetric and monotonous dependence I(r) it is easy to see that
P (I) = 2πr(I)

3 DISCUSSION

(5b)

(7)

(8)

The derived proﬁle of input beam has some unique features, that makes it especially attractive for nonlinear

speckle-noise reduction. First, such ﬁelds are easy to generate, to control and to operate.

Second, in bulk a layer of nonlinear media1 diﬀractional mixing diminish the resulting decoherence of a ﬁeld.
Gaussian beam has absolutely minimal diﬀractional divergence and consequently it allows to use thicker layers,
increasing the eﬃciency of coherence transformation.

At last, it should be noted that according to paper4 zones of identical intensity (for (7) these are concentric
circles) belong to one mode or, in other words, produce coherent radiation. In order to generate output light with
desired structure of spatial coherence function one just need to mix the ﬁeld after nonlinear media on suitable
stationary diﬀuser.

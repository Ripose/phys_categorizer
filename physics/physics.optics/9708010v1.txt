Abstract

This is a theoretical study of the interplay of optical phase-conjugation and
multiple scattering. We calculate the intensity of light reﬂected by a phase-
conjugating mirror when it is placed behind a disordered medium. We com-
pare the results of a fully phase-coherent theory with those from the theory
of radiative transfer. Both methods are equivalent if the dwell time τdwell
of a photon in the disordered medium is much larger than the inverse of
the frequency shift 2∆ω acquired at the phase-conjugating mirror. When
τdwell∆ω <
1, in contrast, phase coherence drastically aﬀects the reﬂected
∼
intensity. In particular, a minimum in the dependence of the reﬂectance on
the disorder strength disappears when ∆ω is reduced below 1/τdwell. The
analogies and diﬀerences with Andreev reﬂection of electrons at the interface
between a normal metal and a superconductor are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

∆ω, a process known as four-wave mixing [5–7].

Phase conjugation is the reversal of the sign of the phase of a wave function. A phase-
conjugated wave retraces the path of the original wave, thereby canceling all accumulated
phase shifts. Phase conjugation was ﬁrst discovered for electronic waves [1], and later for
optical waves [2,3]. For electrons, phase conjugation takes place at the interface between
a normal metal and a superconductor. An electron at energy E above the Fermi energy
EF is reﬂected at the angle of incidence (retro-reﬂected) as a hole at energy E below EF ,
a process known as Andreev reﬂection [4]. A phase-conjugating mirror for light consists of
a cell containing a liquid or crystal with a large nonlinear susceptibility, pumped by two
counter-propagating beams at frequency ω0. A wave incident at frequency ω0 + ∆ω is then
retro-reﬂected at frequency ω0 −
The interplay of multiple scattering by disorder and phase conjugation has been studied
extensively in the electronic case, both experimentally and theoretically. (See Ref. [8] for
a review.) In the optical case the emphasis has been on weakly disordered media, which
do not strongly scatter the waves [9]. Complete wave-front reconstruction is possible only
if the distorted wave front remains approximately planar, since perfect time reversal upon
reﬂection holds only in a narrow range of angles of incidence for realistic systems. (For the
hypothetical case of perfect time-reversal at all angles, see Ref. [10].) McMichael, Ewbank,
and Vachss [11] measured the intensity of the reconstructed wave front for a strongly inho-
mogeneous medium (small transmission probability T0), and found that it was proportional
to T 2
0 — in agreement with the theoretical prediction of Gu and Yeh [12]. If T0 ≪
1, the
intensity of the reconstructed wave is much smaller than the total reﬂected intensity. The
total reﬂected intensity was not studied previously, perhaps because it was believed that the
diﬀusive illumination resulting from a strongly inhomogeneous medium would render the
eﬀect of phase conjugation insigniﬁcant. In this paper we show that a strongly disordered
medium backed by a phase-conjugating mirror has unusual optical properties, diﬀerent both
from the weakly disordered case and from the electronic analogue.

We distinguish two regimes, depending on the relative magnitude of the frequency shift
2∆ω acquired at the phase-conjugating mirror and the inverse of the dwell time τdwell of

conjugation leads to a constructive interference of multiply scattered light in the disordered
medium. In the incoherent regime, ∆ω
1/τdwell, interference eﬀects are insigniﬁcant. In
both regimes we compute the reﬂectances R+ and R−, deﬁned as the reﬂected power at
∆ω divided by the incident power at frequency ω0 + ∆ω. A distinguishing
frequency ω0 ±
feature of the two regimes is that (in a certain parameter range) the reﬂectance R− decreases
monotonically as a function of L/l in the coherent regime, while in the incoherent regime it
ﬁrst decreases and then increases.

The outline of this paper is as follows. After having formulated the problem in Sec. II, we
discuss in Sec. III its solution using the Boltzmann equation, ignoring phase coherence. This
is the theory of radiative transfer [13,14]. A simple result is obtained if we neglect angular
correlations between the scattering in the disordered medium and at the phase-conjugating
mirror. We compare this approximation with an exact solution of the Boltzmann equation.
In Sec. IV the phase-coherent problem is addressed, analytically using random-matrix theory,

and numerically using the method of recursive Green functions. Results of this section were
brieﬂy presented in Ref. [15]. We conclude in Sec. V with a comparison with the electronic
analogue of this problem.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

We study the system shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a disordered medium (length L, mean
free path l), backed at one end by a phase-conjugating mirror. The other end is illuminated
diﬀusively at frequency ω+ = ω0 + ∆ω, where ω0 is the pump frequency of the mirror. We
are interested in the amount of light reﬂected at frequency ω+ and ω− = ω0 −
To reduce the problem to the scattering of a scalar wave, we choose a two-dimensional
geometry. The scatterers consist of dielectric rods in the z-direction, randomly placed in
the x-y-plane. The electric ﬁeld points in the z-direction and varies in the x-y-plane only.
Two-dimensional scatterers are somewhat artiﬁcial, but can be realized experimentally [16].
We believe that our results apply qualitatively to a three-dimensional geometry as well,
because the randomization of the polarization by the disorder renders the vector character
of the light insigniﬁcant.

The z-component of the electric ﬁeld at the frequencies ω+ and ω− is given by

The crucial diﬀerence with Ref. [10] is that the reﬂectance is angle dependent and that the
reﬂection matrix is non-Hermitian. This implies that not all phases will be canceled in the
2 as a function of the angle
conjugation process. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the reﬂectance
of incidence φ for α = π/4 and two values of δ = 0.75 and 0.9. The value α = π/4 is chosen
such that a = 1 for normal incidence at frequency ω0 (i.e. for φ = 0 , δ = 0). The two values
of δ have been chosen such that the angular average of the reﬂectance,

is > 1 for δ = 0.75 and < 1 for δ = 0.9. (The cos φ weight factor in Eq. (2.7) corresponds
to diﬀusive illumination.) In most of the numerical examples throughout this paper we will
use these values of α and δ.

III. PHASE-INCOHERENT SOLUTION

B. Neglect of angular correlations

A simple analytical treatment is possible if the angular correlations between multiple
reﬂections by the disorder and the phase-conjugating mirror are neglected. Here we present
this simpliﬁed treatment, and in the next subsection we compare with an exact numerical
solution of the Boltzmann equation.

We ﬁrst consider the disordered region by itself. The plane-wave transmission probability
2 is the ratio of transmitted to incident ﬂux when the incident light is a plane wave in
t(φ)
|
the direction (cos φ, sin φ). The transmission probability T for diﬀusive illumination is then
given by

|

such that T is the fraction of the ﬂux incident from a diﬀusive source which is transmitted
through the disordered region. This probability has been calculated in Ref. [21] from the
Boltzmann equation (3.2). The result is

Since T and A are angular averages, we are neglecting angular correlations. The light

The light that has been reﬂected once has traversed the medium twice, which leads to a
contribution T 2A to R−. Light that has been reﬂected three times by the mirror contributes

Eq. (3.16) is the analogue for the present problem involving two coupled frequencies
of the Schwarzschild-Milne equation in the theory of radiative transfer [13,14]. We have
solved it numerically by discretizing with respect to x so that the integral equation becomes
a matrix equation. From the average intensities ¯I±(x) one ﬁnds the intensities I±(x, φ)
using Eqs. (3.14) and (3.15). The reﬂectances R± then follow from Eqs. (3.6)–(3.8). For
numerical stability we have imposed a cut-oﬀ on the rapidly oscillating function a(φ) at
grazing incidence, by setting a(φ) = 0 for 0.497 π < φ < 1

In Figs. 3 and 4 we show results for ¯I±(x) and R± for α = π/4 and δ = 0.75 and 0.9. For
δ = 0.75 there is an eﬀective gain at the mirror (A > 1), while for δ = 0.9 there is an eﬀective
loss (A < 1). For an ordinary mirror one can show that ¯I±(0) = 1
2I0. Instead, we ﬁnd that
2I0 for δ = 0.75, indicating gain, and ¯I−(0) < ¯I+(0) < 1
¯I−(0) > ¯I+(0) > 1
2I0 for δ = 0.9,
indicating loss. In each case the density proﬁles are approximately linear in the bulk, with
L and x = 0. For δ = 0.75, both R− and R+
some bending near the boundaries at x =
diverge when L/l = 28, while for δ = 0.9 no such divergence occurs. As discussed earlier,
the divergence indicates that for δ = 0.75 and L/l > 28 there is no stationary solution to
the Boltzmann equation. For ﬁxed L/l and α, the divergence of R± occurs at a critical
value δc, such that a stationary solution requires δ > δc. The dependence of δc on L/l at
ﬁxed α = π/4 is plotted in Fig. 5.

In Figs. 4 and 5 we also compare the exact numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation
of this subsection with the approximate analytical solution (3.12) of the previous subsection.
As one can see, the agreement with the exact results is quite good.

dimensional scattering matrices we embed the disordered medium in a waveguide (width W ),

is discretized on a square lattice (lattice constant d, length L, width W ). Disorder is
introduced by letting the relative dielectric constant ε ﬂuctuate from site to site between
δε. Using the method of recursive Green functions [23] we compute the scattering matrix
1
Sdisorder(ω) of the disordered medium at frequencies ω+ and ω−. The reﬂection matrix rPCM
of the phase-conjugating mirror is calculated by discretizing Eq. (2.2). From Sdisorder(ω±) and
rPCM we obtain the reﬂection matrix r of the entire system, and hence the reﬂectances (4.10).
We took W = 51 d, δε = 0.5, α = π/4, and varied δ and L. For the coherent case we
took ω+ = ω− = 1.252 c/d, and for the incoherent case ω+ = 1.252 c/d, ω− = 1.166 c/d.
These parameters correspond to N+ = 22, l+ = 15.5 d at frequency ω+. The mean free path
is determined using Eq. (3.10), which holds up to small corrections of order N −1. In the
incoherent case we have N− = 20, l− = 20.1 d. This leads to ∆ω = 0.043 c/d and a dwell
6.5, which should

be well in the incoherent regime. For comparison with random-matrix theory, we take the

V. COMPARISON WITH ANDREEV REFLECTION

We have studied the reﬂection of light by a disordered dielectric medium in front of a
phase-conjugating mirror. This problem has an electronic analogue [17,18]. The electronic
disordered system consists of a metal, in which electron or hole excitations are scattered
elastically by randomly placed impurities. Retro-reﬂection at the phase-conjugating mirror
is analogous to Andreev reﬂection at the interface with a superconductor. The Fermi energy
EF plays the role of the pump frequency ω0, while the excitation energy E corresponds to
the frequency shift ∆ω. In spite of these similarities, the optical eﬀects found in this paper
have no electronic analogue. It is instructive to see where the analogy breaks down.

To this end we compare the wave equation (2.2) with the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation

bility is played here by the pair potential ∆(r), which is only nonzero in the superconductor,
where it equals ∆0e−iψ. Comparing Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) for the electronic case with the
optical equations (2.2) and (2.4) one notices many similarities, and some diﬀerences which
amount to a redeﬁnition of quantities. There is however one essential diﬀerence: the matrix
operator in Eq. (5.1) is Hermitian, while that in Eq. (2.2) is not, because of an extra mi-
nus sign in one of the oﬀ-diagonal elements. This minus sign is the origin of the diﬀerence
between Andreev reﬂection and optical phase conjugation.

In the optical case a disordered medium becomes transparent (R− = 1) [9,10] for unit
reﬂectance at the phase-conjugating mirror (a = 1). This does not happen in the electronic
case, where R− is reduced by disorder even for ideal Andreev reﬂection. The reﬂection matrix

Comparison with Eq. (4.6) for rPCM shows that Andreev reﬂection is independent of the
angle of incidence; the matrix a in Eq. (4.6) is replaced by the unit matrix in Eq. (5.3). This
is a substantial simpliﬁcation of the electronic problem, compared with the optical analogue.
The matrix rNS is unitary, in contrast to rPCM, so that the appearance of gain or loss at

the phase-conjugating mirror has no electronic counterpart. The reﬂectance R− = 1

The result (5.5) is what one obtains from Eq. (3.12) for the case A = 1 of unit reﬂectance
at the interface. (The transmittance T = (1 + 2L/πl)−1 of the disordered medium is the
same for electrons and photons.) The result (5.4) however, is not what one would expect
from the optical analogue. Indeed, Eq. (4.17) with a0 = 1 would give R− = 1 for all L in the
case of unit reﬂectance at the phase-conjugating mirror. The reason that the analogy with
Andreev reﬂection breaks down is the diﬀerence of a minus sign in the wave equations (2.2)
and (5.1), which reappears in the reﬂection matrices (4.6) and (5.3) for phase conjugation,
and ultimately in the reﬂectances in the coherent regime:

Here t and r are the transmission and reﬂection matrices of the disordered medium, which
satisfy tt† + rr† = 1.

In conclusion, we have shown that the presence of a phase-conjugating mirror behind
a random medium drastically changes the total reﬂected intensity, even when the medium
is so disordered that wave-front reconstruction is ineﬀective. On increasing the frequency
diﬀerence ∆ω between the incident radiation and the pump beams, a minimum in the
disorder dependence of the reﬂected intensity appears. In a certain parameter range, the
disordered medium reﬂects less radiation on reducing ∆ω. Experimental observation of this
“darkening” would be a striking demonstration of phase-shift cancellations in a random
medium.

Integrals over the unitary group are needed for the computation of
decomposition (4.11) of the transmission and reﬂection matrices. We ﬁnd it convenient
to use a slightly modiﬁed version of the diagrammatic technique, in which we apply the
diagrammatic rules without making explicit use of the polar decomposition. We ﬁrst outline
in which the diagrammatic method is used for the integration of
the calculation of
the matrices U and V in Eq. (4.11), and then discuss the modiﬁcation of the diagrammatic
method.

compute the value of the coeﬃcients Vc1,...,ck, but it is not relevant for the general structure

transformations

that respect the symmetry of r. The same group of transformations leaves invariant the
circular orthogonal ensemble (COE), consisting of uniformly distributed unitary and sym-
metric matrices. A diagrammatic technique for averages over the COE is presented in Ref.
[24]. As before, the general structure of the average of a polynomial of a matrix from the
COE is entirely determined by the invariance under the transformations (A7), and therefore
applies to the reﬂection matrix r as well. It reads [24,31]

Now that we have identiﬁed the formal equivalence of an average over the (non-unitary)
symmetric reﬂection matrix r and a unitary symmetric matrix from the COE, we can directly
apply the diagrammatic rules of Refs. [29] and [24] to an average over the matrix r, provided
we know the coeﬃcients Vc1,...,ck for the ensemble of reﬂection matrices r of a disordered
waveguide. To ﬁnd these coeﬃcients, we use the fact that they factorize, to leading order

from which s(x, y), s′(x, y), and h(x) can be calculated. The average reﬂectances

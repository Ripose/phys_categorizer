Propagation of ultrashort electromagnetic wave packets in free space beyond the
paraxial and slowly-varying-envelope approximations : a time-domain approach

A time-domain approach is proposed for the propagation of ultrashort electromagnetic wave pack-
ets beyond the paraxial and the slowly-varying-envelope approximations. An analytical method
based on perturbation theory is used to solve the wave equation in free space without resorting
to Fourier transforms. An exact solution is obtained in terms of successive temporal and spatial
derivatives of a monochromatic paraxial beam. The special case of a radially polarized transverse
magnetic wave packet is discussed.

State-of-the-art mode-locked laser oscillators can gen-
erate ultrafast pulses whose duration can be as short as
a few optical cycles [1]. Such pulses – with a ﬁnite spa-
tiotemporal extent and thus carrying a ﬁnite quantity of
energy – can in principle be isolated, ampliﬁed, tempo-
rally compressed, and spatially focused to reach extreme
ﬁeld intensities within a volume that is of the order of the
third power of the laser wavelength (λ3) [1]. In this sit-
uation the commonly used paraxial approximation and
slowly-varying-envelope approximation (SVEA) do not
apply directly and must be corrected.

In 1975, Lax et al. proposed a method to express exact
solutions of Maxwell’s equations in terms of an inﬁnite se-
ries of corrections applied to a paraxial electric ﬁeld [2].
So far, this approach has led numerous studies dealing
with non-paraxial optics. Unfortunately, as it is also the
case for the electromagnetic beam theory developed by
Davies [3], the so-called “method of Lax” only applies to
monochromatic beams, or CW laser signals. With the
outstanding developments in femtosecond and attosec-
ond technologies, more appropriate tools are required to
describe the propagation of non-paraxial ultrashort light
pulses, sometimes called light bullets. Recently, Lu et
al. [4] have proposed a method to describe the free-space
propagation of vectorial non-paraxial ultrashort pulsed
beams in the frequency domain. In this letter, we present
an alternative approach to this problem entirely in the
time domain, i.e. without using Fourier transforms.

The spatiotemporal propagation of an electromagnetic
wave packet is governed by Maxwell’s equations. Solving
these equations in free space proceeds in three steps :
1. the transverse electric ﬁeld vector E⊥ is found from
the wave equation, 2. the longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez
E = 0),
is obtained from the divergence equation (
and 3. the magnetic ﬂux vector B is calculated from the
∂tB) or
diﬀerential form of Faraday’s law (
B = c−2∂tE),
the diﬀerential form of Amp`ere’s law (
where c is the speed of light in vacuo, and ∂ t
∂/∂t.
In the case of a paraxial wave packet whose duration
is much longer than the optical period, this sequence of
operations is performed with ease. We now describe each
of these three steps in detail beyond the range of validity
of the paraxial approximation and of the SVEA.

The use of the retarded time t′ = t

z/c instead of
the (normal) time t is sometimes preferred when dealing
with the propagation of electromagnetic signals of ﬁnite
spatiotemporal extent [5]. More speciﬁcally, it separates
the transverse envelope (diﬀraction) from the temporal
envelope (pulse shape). After some manipulations, the
result given at Eq. (3) can be expressed in terms of the
retarded variables t′ = t

. For paraxial and
with Θ = j
quasi-monochromatic optical beams, the term Θ˜E⊥ is
(cid:1)
vanishingly small compared to the complex ﬁeld ˜E⊥ it-
˜E⊥. In that case, Eq. (5) leads
self, i.e.
to the paraxial wave equation [7]. On the other hand,
when the transverse (or longitudinal) dimension of the
wave packet is of the order of the wavelength, the term
Θ˜E⊥ can no longer be neglected. However, the modulus
Θ˜E⊥
of this contribution, i.e.
, remains small even for

strongly focused single-cycle light pulses [2, 6, 8, 9]. As
a consequence, we can consider Eq. (5) to be a perturbed
paraxial wave equation.

We observe that the partial diﬀerential operator Θ
cannot be reduced to a simpler operator, proportional
z or
only to spatial or temporal derivatives, i.e. Θ

temporal eﬀects cannot be decoupled. Consequently, a
solution of Eq. (5) is found by expanding the transverse
electric ﬁeld vector ˜E⊥ as a power series of Θ. In a com-
pact notation it reads :

A general equation giving the magnetic ﬂux vector B
of an arbitrary ultrashort wave packet can be deduced
from Maxwell’s equations but cannot always be reduced
to a simple expression, as it is the case for monochro-
matic transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves (see Eq.
(7.11) of Ref. 5). However, for a given distribution and
polarization of the transverse electric ﬁeld vector corre-
sponds a spatiotemporal arrangement of the ﬁelds that is
unique and guarantees the stability of the wave packet.
As an example, let us consider the case of a TM0l wave
packet whose transverse electric ﬁeld is radially polar-
ized, i.e. E⊥ = Erar and Eθ = 0, where r and θ are polar
coordinates in the plane perpendicular the propagation
axis (the z-axis), and l = 1, 2, 3, . . . The intensity proﬁle
of this particular family of beams is characterized by l
concentric and angularly symmetric (∂θE⊥ = 0) bright
B = c−2∂tE), we ob-
rings [7]. From Amp`ere’s law (
tain the two following equations (Br = 0 and Bz = 0) :

If we combine Eqs. (11a) and (11b) together, we obtain
the divergence equation that we solved earlier at Eq. (10).
Thus, the solution of Eq. (11a) assures that Eq. (11b)
is also respected.
If we express the ﬁelds in complex
notation (and then in terms of the retarded variables),
the formal inversion of Eq. (11a) yields :

In the past, many investigations have been devoted to
the study of the paraxial wave equation and its solutions
(see for example Ref. 11). More speciﬁcally, we make
reference to the wide family of the Gauss-Hermite and
Gauss-Laguerre beam modes, considered to be a good
representation of the transverse electromagnetic modes
of optical resonators [7, 12]. According to the formal-
ism we propose, these solutions, or any solution obtained
under the paraxial beam optics theory, can be extended
to the case of tightly focused (non-paraxial) ultrashort
(few-cycle) wave packets using the general formulation
we developed. We emphasize the fact that we obtained
all the spatiotemporal corrections in the time-domain, al-
ternatively to the Fourier transform approach [4]. How-
ever, the method described here has the feature that it
displays directly the corrections of the SVEA on the four-
dimensional structure of the wave packet, as needed to
correctly predict ultrafast interactions with matter. For
instance, dispersion and nonlinear optical eﬀects could
be embedded in this formalism [6].

vectorial and non-paraxial generalization – of a previ-

ble to show that Eq. (9) simpliﬁes to the equation for
paraxial ultrashort pulsed beams when the spatial varia-
tions of the ﬁeld due to diﬀraction are negligible com-
pared to the variations of the temporal envelope, i.e.
−1
0 ∂ t′ (see Eq. (8) of Ref. 8). Besides, it
when Θ
has been demonstrated that the perturbation method we
used leads to the same results that are obtained from
integral methods [8]. We thus observe that the ﬁelds
given at Eqs. (9) and (10) are equivalent to the Eqs. (25)
and (28) of the paper of Lu et al. [4].

The irreducibility of the expansion parameter Θ in-
dicates that in free space, the spatial and temporal en-
velopes of a non-paraxial ultrashort wave packet are non-
separable. This coupling ensures the wave packet’s sta-
bility under tight focusing and reveals itself as a reorga-
nization of the structure of the wave packet, noticeable as
modiﬁcations of the carrier wave and the spatiotemporal
envelope [8].

For a gaussian beam (with a gaussian pulse
the spatial and temporal contributions,
i.e.
shape),
(2k0)−n∂ n
z′ ˜E⊥ and ω
t′ ˜E⊥, are respectively propor-
tional to (2k0zR)−n = (k0r0)−2n and (ω0∆t)−n, where
zR = k0r2
0/2 is the Rayleigh distance, r0 is the wave
packet transverse extent at focus (beam waist), and ∆t
is the pulse duration. The expansion of Θn yields also

crossed-terms with various powers of k0r0 and ω0∆t.
However, for a single-cycle pulse (∆t = 2π/ω0) focused
down to one wavelength (r0 = 2π/k0), the most im-
portant contribution comes from the temporal envelope
and decreases as (2π)−n. Consequently, it is observed
that a truncated series (n = 0, 1, 2) reproduces the exact
ﬁeld with a good accuracy (see Porras [8]). Nonetheless,
for slightly focused and long pulses (r0 >> 2π/k0 and
∆t >> 2π/ω0), the formalism reduces to the expressions
for paraxial and monochromatic beams [2, 11].

The full vectorial treatment we have presented here
also leads to an exact evaluation of the associated longi-
tudinal electric and magnetic ﬁelds. These ﬁeld compo-
nents are not usually dealt with in optics ; however, they
must be taken into consideration for the study of rela-
tivistic eﬀects in laser-matter interactions and for the in-
vestigation of electron acceleration in intense laser ﬁelds.

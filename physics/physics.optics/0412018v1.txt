We perform coherent three-level spectroscopy and demonstrate induced transparency in acetylene
molecules in a hollow-core photonic band-gap ﬁber (HC-PBF) at 1.5µm. The induced spectral
transmission window is used to demonstrate slow-light eﬀects, and we show that the observed
broadening of the spectral features is due to collisions of the molecules with the inner walls of the
ﬁber core. Our results illustrate that such ﬁbers can be used to facilitate strong coherent light-matter
interactions even when the optical response of the individual molecules is weak.

The ﬁelds of photonics and quantum optics have under-
gone immense technological and scientiﬁc advancement
in the past decade. The growth of the telecommunica-
tions industry has given rise to exotic devices such as
the hollow-core photonic band-gap ﬁber (HC-PBF) [1, 2]
which can guide light over hundreds of meters through a
hollow core surrounded by a photonic crystal structure
(see Fig.1.) that localizes light in the core. In addition,
since the nonlinearities are determined primarily by the
gas in the ﬁber’s core, such ﬁbers can be used to produce
eﬃcient Raman scattering [3] and solitons with megawatt
powers [4].

In parallel with these developments, there has been
tremendous progress in the ﬁeld of coherent atom-photon
interactions. The richness of physics in manipulating
quantum states of matter and creating coherent super-
positions has led to numerous studies in atom cool-
ing and Bose-Einstein condensation [5], quantum infor-
mation and computation [6, 7, 8], and electromagnet-
In particu-
ically induced transparency (EIT) [9, 10].
lar, the phenomenon of EIT has led to an assortment
of potentially practical applications such as ultra-slow
light [11, 12], light storage in a medium [13], and single-
photon switching [14, 15]. Our research is motivated by
the desire to integrate novel photonic devices [16] with
coherent atom-photon interactions and to build useful de-
vices for the ﬁelds of telecommunications and quantum
information processing. Hollow-core photonic band-gap
ﬁber, with the ability to conﬁne atoms and molecules to
its core for extremely long interaction lengths and to in-
tegrate itself readily with the existing telecommunication
technology, seems to be the ideal bridge between photon-
ics and quantum optics.

In this Letter, we describe experiments that repre-
sent the ﬁrst demonstration of coherent resonant spec-
troscopic eﬀects in these ﬁbers. We perform coherent
three-level spectroscopy of acetylene molecules conﬁned

to the core of a HC-PBF. Using a strong control beam to
modify coherently a three-level molecular system, we ob-
serve induced transparencies of the probe beam as large
as 50% and we demonstrate slow light delays via this
transparency window. These results indicate that such
ﬁbers can be used to greatly enhance light-matter inter-
actions even when the optical response of the individual
molecules is weak.

Acetylene has attracted signiﬁcant interest due to its
spectral overlap with the low-loss C-band ﬁber telecom-
munications window [17].
In addition, several low-loss
HC-PBF have been demonstrated with bandgaps in this
spectral range [2]. This motivates us to study coherence
eﬀects in acetylene (C2H2), a linear symmetric molecule,
which has clean ro-vibrational transitions [18] in this
wavelength range [19]. Only a few studies have demon-
strated coherence eﬀects in molecular systems [20, 21],
and one of the primary reasons is due to the typically
weak oscillator strengths of the molecular transitions.
Observation of an appreciable eﬀect in a bulk molecu-
lar gas necessitates the opposing requirement of a tightly
focused laser beam and a long interaction length. While
the eﬀective interaction between the optical ﬁeld and the
molecular system can be enhanced by using an optical
cavity, the small core diameter of the HC-PBG, together
with practically loss-less propagation of ﬁelds over many
meters, provides an attractive alternative.

In our experiments we use a 1.33-m-long HC-PBF
(Blazephotonics, HC-1550-01) which has a core diameter
of 12 µm and a band gap extending from 1490 to 1620 nm.
As shown in Fig. 1, the two ends of the ﬁber are placed
in separate vacuum cells. During assembly, we purge the
air inside the ﬁber using nitrogen gas and then evacuate
to a pressure below 10−6 Torr. One of the cells is then
ﬁlled with 99.8% pure C2H2. We detect the presence of
the gas in the other cell spectroscopically to ensure that
the core is ﬁlled with acetylene. All experiments are per-
formed in steady state with both of the cells at the same
pressure, which ranges from 10-100 mTorr. For the ﬁber
used in these measurements, steady state is reached in
less than an hour.

We use two tunable external-cavity lasers for pump-
probe spectroscopy. The emission from one of the lasers is
tuned to 1534 nm and ampliﬁed by a 1-W erbium-doped
ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA). We use the ampliﬁed beam as
our control beam. The other laser is tuned to 1517 nm
and serves as the probe beam. The control and probe
beams are mixed using ﬁber polarization controllers and
a polarization beam combiner. The co-propagating con-
trol and probe beams are collimated and then launched
into one end of the ﬁber with coupling eﬃciencies of 50%
using a microscope objective. We ﬁlter out the control
beam from the probe using an interference ﬁlter with a
rejection ratio of >50 dB, and the probe is detected by a
photodetector.

beam is tuned between the levels 0(Σ+
g)(J=17) and
ν1+ν3(Σ+
u)(J=16), denoted as levels b and c, respec-
tively. The probe beam is tuned between level a, which
is 0(Σ+
g)(J=15), and c. These are the P(17) and

2

R(15) lines of 12C2H2 [18]. The probe power is main-
tained below 500 µW, and the wavelength of the probe
is scanned over the R(15) transition line. As shown
in Fig. 2(a), without the control beam we observe the
Doppler-broadened absorption of the probe beam with a
width of 480 MHz. In the presence of the control beam,
a transparency window is opened. Figure 2(b) shows a
typical trace of the probe-ﬁeld absorption of the R(15)
line in presence of a 320 mW (measured at the output
of the ﬁber) control beam tuned exactly to the center
of the P(17) transition. While induced transparencies of
this magnitude have been observed routinely in focused
geometries in atomic systems such as rubidium, observ-
ing this transparency feature in acetylene is remarkable
in light of the fact that the oscillator strength of the tran-
sition is several orders of magnitude less than that for the
D1 and D2 rubidium transitions. We ﬁnd that the use
of orthogonally polarized pump and probe beams does
not aﬀect our measurements since the polarizations of
the two beams are scrambled as they propagate through
the ﬁber.

For an understanding of our experimental results, we
solve the density matrix equations for a three-level Λ
system (see Fig. 2), where one of the two lower levels,
(Jb, m) is coupled to the upper level (Jc, m) with a strong
control ﬁeld Ec, while the transition (Ja, m) − (Jc, m) is
probed with a weak ﬁeld Ep. Here m is the orientational
quantum number, denoting the alignment of the other-
wise degenerate ro-vibrational levels. We ﬁrst calculate
the steady-state population distribution for the three-
level system in presence of the strong control ﬁeld and no
probe ﬁeld [22]. We consider a semi-open system, where
the upper level radiatively decays to the two lower levels
with a decay rate (γ) independent of m. We further con-
sider a collisional redistribution of population between
the two lower levels at a rate wab = wba. We use the
resulting steady-state population expressions ρm(0)
for

The dephasing rates are expressed in the form, γij =
(γi + γj)/2 + γcoll
, for i = a, b, c, where, γi is the decay
rate of level i and γcoll
is the dephasing rate due to colli-
sion of the molecules with each other and with the inside
wall of the HC-PBG ﬁber. Following Ref. [25], an esti-
mate for the pressure-broadened lifetimes for these tran-
sitions of C2H2 at wavelengths of 1.5 µm is of the order of
10 MHz/Torr. At our working pressures near 50 mTorr,
the line width is estimated to be less than 1 MHz. In con-
trast, an estimate of the linewidth due to dephasing colli-
sions with the inside walls of the ﬁber, assuming a mean
thermal velocity of the molecules of 400 m/sec inside a
cylinder of diameter 12 µm, predicts a value which is an
order of magnitude larger. We expect these collisions to

be the major source of decoherence in our system. The
dephasing rate γij is therefore assumed to be the same
for all coherences, with γcoll

wall.
To compare our experiment with theory, we ﬁrst av-
erage the coherence over the Doppler proﬁle and sum
over the orientation (m) to obtain the probe ﬁeld sus-
ceptibility χ, and we ﬁt our experimental data to the
transmission coeﬃcient

where L is the length of the ﬁber. In Eq. (3), we assume
the Rabi frequency for the control ﬁeld is constant along
the length of the ﬁber.

The variable parameters in the theory are:

(i) the
constant term in the exponent of Eq. (3), which is the
product of the number density, the length of the ﬁber,
and the constants for the Rabi frequency of the probe
ﬁeld, (ii) the collisional redistribution rate of the ground-
state population wab, (iii) the pure electronic-vibrational
c = 2µ0Ec/~, (iv) the upper-state de-
Rabi strength Ω0
cay rate 2γ, and (v) the dephasing rate γwall
coll due to
collisions with the inside walls of the ﬁber. We ﬁrst
estimate the constant for (i) for the probe ﬁeld by ﬁt-
ting the Doppler-broadened probe-ﬁeld absorption with-
out the control ﬁeld (Fig. 2a.). The relative height of
the probe-ﬁeld absorption, with and without the control
ﬁeld, depends primarily on the rate wab. A choice of
wab = 0.4γ matches well with all our experimental ab-
sorption curves over the entire range of the control-ﬁeld
strength. We ﬁt the remaining parameters, Ω0
c, γ, and
γwall
coll to the experimental data. We make an initial guess
of Ω0
c by estimating Ec from the input control ﬁeld power
in the ﬁber and using the values for µ0 from Ref. [26]. For
γ we use an estimate from Ref. [25], and our initial guess
for γwall
coll

is as discussed above.

As seen in Fig. 2(b), our theoretical model is in excel-
lent agreement with our experimentally measured probe-
ﬁeld absorption. Our value for Ω0
c = 9.3 MHz, is consis-
tent with the measured control power of 320 mW, and
a value of γ = 0.96 MHz and γcoll
wall = 17.28 MHz is esti-
mated from the ﬁt. Figure 3(a) shows a plot of the trans-
parency as a function of the control power measured at
the output end of the ﬁber together with the correspond-
ing theoretical plot. Presently in our experiments, we
are limited by the power of our ampliﬁers for the control
ﬁeld, but theory predicts a much larger transparency at
higher powers. The measured transparency full-width at
half maximum (FWHM) in Fig. 3(b) shows a linear de-
pendence on control power, which has the behavior of the
EIT linewidth ΓEIT ⇒ Ω0

An interesting application of our system, which has
relevance to both telecommunications and quantum in-
formation, is to use this spectroscopic feature to induce
a controllable pulse delay. Sharp changes in the absorp-
tion of a probe ﬁeld due to coherent eﬀects produced by a
strong control ﬁeld are accompanied by dramatic changes
in the refractive index [11, 12]. The group delay expe-

using a tunable bandpass ﬁlter, and the probe pulses
were detected with a 10- GHz receiver. For these mea-
surements the control beam power measured at the out-
put of the ﬁber is 200 mW, and the on-resonance probe
absorption and relative transparency are both approxi-
mately 40%. Figure 4 shows the probe pulse with the
control beam oﬀ and with it on. The delay measured in
the presence of the control beam is 800 ps. This repre-
sents, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst demonstration of slow
light at telecommunications wavelengths using molecular
spectroscopic features.

In summary, we have performed coherent three-level
spectroscopy with acetylene molecules inside a HC-PBF.

One of the major advantages of our system is that for
a given L, we can produce large delays even at low
pressures. As a proof of concept, we generated 19-ns
(FWHM) probe pulses using an amplitude modulator
and tuned the wavelength of the probe to be on resonance
with the a − c transition. The wavelength of the coprop-
agating CW control beam was tuned to be on resonance
with the b − c transition. The control beam was ﬁltered

decoherence due to collision of the molecules with the
inside wall of the ﬁber. We used this spectroscopic fea-
ture to demonstrate a potential application of producing
slow light with molecules inside optical ﬁbers at telecom
wavelengths.

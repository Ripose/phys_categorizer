Abstract

In the process of optical second-harmonic generation an X-wave, travelling at the

group velocity of the fundamental frequency, spontaneously forms.

Its parame-

ters, as well as the angular spectrum, are directly correlated to the group velocity

mismatch and to the wavevector mismatch between the two harmonics. A novel

mechanism for spatio-temporal localized waves generation is thus proposed.

According to some authors (see (Recami, 1998)) the ﬁrst prediction of localized solutions

to the linear Maxwell equations dates back to the work of Stratton in 1941. (Stratton, 1941)

Since then a huge amount of research work has been produced in this ﬁeld, starting from

the article by Durning et al. in 1987. (Durnin et al., 1987) Experimental results have con-

ﬁrmed the existence of these waves, (Mugnai et al., 2000; Saari and Reivelt, 1997; Sonajalg

et al., 1997) and important theoretical advances have been obtained: from generalization of

the propagation invariant solutions (Gutierrez et al., 2000; Piestun and Shamir, 1998), to

the description of practical realizations with ﬁnite aperture (Shaarawi, 1997; Stepanishen,

1998; Stepanishen and Sun, 1997; Ziolkowski et al., 1993), to the analysis of dispersive me-

dia (Porras, 2001; Sonajalg and Saari, 1996; Zamboni-Rached et al., 2002) and waveguides

(Zamboni-Rached et al., 2001a). A lot of attention has been dedicated to the superluminal

propagation(Recami, 1998) and signiﬁcant possible applications, as femtosecond microscopy

and communication systems(Lu and He, 1999) have been evisaged. (Saari, 2001)

The most simple localized wave, solution to the wave equation in a dispersive media with

refractive index n(Ω), can be expressed as a superposition of Bessel beams:

∞

E(r, z, t) = Z

0

S(Ω)J0(κr)exp[i(kzz

Ωt)]dΩ,

−

where κ = β(Ω)sin[θ(Ω)] and kz = β(Ω)cos[θ(Ω)] are, respectively, the transversal and the

longitudinal wavenumbers, with β(Ω) = (Ω/c)n(Ω) and c the vacuum light velocity.(Sonajalg

and Saari, 1996) Eq.(1) describes a non-diﬀracting-non-dispersive beam if the X-wave dis-

persion relation

(1)

(2)

is satisﬁed. Indeed, in such a way, the group velocity dispersion k′′

z is zero (together with

higher order derivatives of kz) and the intensity only depends on the combination t

βXz, i.e.

−

kz(Ω) = α + βXΩ,

2

βX = k′

z is the inverse velocity of the wave. Given the spectrum S(Ω), α and βX are the two

parameters of the localized wave. In the case of vacuum, when α = 0 the spatio-temporal

(or angular) spectrum has an X-shape (κ2 = Ω2

c2 (1

−

c2β2

X)) and, due to the invariant prop-

agation, the far-ﬁeld coincides with the near-ﬁeld; thus the wave retains its X-shape in the

physical space (x, y, z, t) and it is superluminal: c

< 1 (in the Fourier-transformable

stationary regime no general theorem about causality and Maxwell equations is violated

(Levi-Civita, 1931), as discussed extensively in the literature (Lunardi, 2001; de Oliveira

et al., 2001; Recami et al., 2000; Rodrigues et al., 2001). When α

= 0 the X in the spectrum

is curved and subluminal propagation is allowed. (Salo and Salomaa, 2001)

In general these localized waves have inﬁnite energy, and only approximations can be re-

alized in practice (as for non-diﬀracting Bessel beams). Finite energy (not propagation

invariant) solutions have been obtained.(de Oliveira and Rodrigues, 2001; Zamboni-Rached

et al., 2001b)

In the case of dispersive media the situation is much more complicated (the general angular

spectra is given by κ2 = β(Ω)2

(βXΩ + α)2, encompassing evanescent waves). In (Reivelt

−

and Saari, 2000) methods for generating X-waves in the optical domain have been suggested:

linear dispersive optical elements may help to satisfy eq.(2). Experiments were realized by

computer holograms. (Sonajalg et al., 1997)

Very recently experimental results (Valiulis et al., 2001) and theoretical investigations (Conti

et al., 2002a,b; Trillo et al., 2002) have pointed out the relevant rule of X-waves in the ﬁeld

of nonlinear optics. As shown in (Trillo et al., 2002), in Kerr and in quadratic media

a plane wave breaks up, due to spatio-temporal modulational instability (the conical emis-

sion), with an angular-spectrum gain strongly resembling that of a localized wave. In (Conti

et al., 2002b), X-shaped numerical solutions of nonlinear wave equations have been reported

3

6
for the ﬁrst time. With reference to second harmonic generation (SH-G), these solutions

are given by two X-waves, one at the fundamental frequency (FF) and the other at the SH,

travelling locked together (they cannot be considered solitary waves, or solitons, in the usual

sense, because they continue to exist in the absence of nonlinearity).

Since X-waves exist in the linear regime (i.e. in the absence of any coupling between FF and

SH), but also as solutions to nonlinear wave equations, it is natural to study the mechanism

of their formation in the intermediate stages. We will show in this Letter that X-waves are

spontaneously produced by an FF pulsed pump beam generating SH during propagation.

We consider the process of SHG in the undepleted pump approximation. For slowly-varying

envelopes and paraxial beams, the SH amplitude a obeys the following equation:

The parameters in (3) are: the wavevector mismatch ∆β = k2 −
(j = 1, 2), and the inverse SH group velocity βS = β′(ω2), being ω2 the SH and ω1 the

2k1 with kj = β(ωj)

FF frequency. We neglect group velocity dispersion (GVD), as being typically small in the

experiments, while the group velocity mismatch (GVM), given by βF −
is dominant.

In (3) the source term is given by the squared amplitude A2 (measured in

βS (βF = β′(ω1)),

W/m2 as

2) of the FF beam, weighted by the relevant nonlinear coeﬃcient χ. Note that

a practically unavoidable loss term ǫ > 0 has been included in the model for technical

convenience. The results will concern the case ǫ

0+. For the sake of simplicity, we

will neglect the diﬀraction at FF, i.e. we will consider suﬃciently large input FF beams.

Consequently A will be an envelope travelling undistorted with group velocity 1/βF . The

initial condition for the SH is assumed to be a(z = 0) = 0, i.e. no SH energy is seeded at the

input face of the nonlinear crystal. To integrate equation (3) we make use of the Fourier-

Bessel representation: a(r, t, z) = 1

practical ﬁnite-aperture realizations of vacuum localized waves. (Ziolkowski et al., 1993) As

in that case, it can been shown that the a ﬁeld is the sum of two X-waves which cancel each

other in the non-causal regions, a form of the extintion theorem. (Born and Wolf, 1980) In

the source-sink picture developed by Saari (Saari, 2001), only the source cone is present (as

physically reasonable).

Eq. (5) strongly resembles the vacuum nondiﬀracting beams developed in (Salo and Salomaa,

2001). However, since we are dealing with a dispersive media, we need to show that (5)

belongs to the class given by (1). By applying the paraxial approximation, we have kz =

inverse spatial separation between FF and SH during tF .

At this point it is necessary to discuss the adopted nomenclature. Rigourously speaking,

eq. (1) deﬁnes the so-called Focus Waves Mode (FWM), a more general class than X-waves,

according to the literature.(Reivelt and Saari, 2000) However we are dealing with almost

monochromatic optical waves, and hence FWM are the so called X-Bessel (Saari and Reivelt,

1997; Sonajalg and Saari, 1996). On the other hand eq. (5) resembles the Focused X-waves

(Saari, 2001). Furthermore the causality implies that only one-half of the double cone is

generated, and thus they can be identiﬁed with the so-called Y-, or Hankel-, waves. (Salo

et al., 2000) For the sake of simplicity we used the term “X-wave” from the beginning.

7

In conclusion we have theoretically predicted that in the process of second harmonic gener-

ation an X-wave, travelling at the FF velocity, and with the α parameter directly connected

to the wavevector mismatch, is spontaneously generated. For a given input FF wave, the

X-wave can be modiﬁed by acting on the parameters ruling the process of SHG, e.g. by

varying the temperature and the orientation of the crystal, while the resulting angular spec-

tra (the far ﬁeld) is given by horizontal parabolas (Eq.(7)) . This mechanism appears as a

valid alternative to the generation of optical localized-waves by linear dispersive devices, or

computer holograms.

Our results can also be interpreted in a diﬀerent way. The fact that the X-waves sponta-

neously form unreveals their fundamental role. In any ultrafast parametric process (e.g. four-

wave mixing or optical parametric ampliﬁcation) the phase-matching condition produces the

correlation between spatial and temporal degrees of freedom at the basis of X-waves. We

believe that, by taking into account such a framework, new generations of parametric sources

could be developed.

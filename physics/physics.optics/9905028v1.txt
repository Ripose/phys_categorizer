Abstract

We analytically compute a localization criterion in double scattering ap-

proximation for a set of dielectric spheres or perfectly conducting disks uni-

formly distributed in a spatial volume which can be either spherical or layered.

For every disordered medium, we numerically investigate a localization crite-

rion, and examine the inﬂuence of the system parameters on the wavelength

localization domains.

I. INTRODUCTION

Several works of Anderson on localization [1] have mostly been related to electrons trans-

port in solids with random impureties. Wolﬂe [2] has proposed a diagrammatical treatment

for the electronic localization in a bidimensional disordered medium. This formalism was

extended to the electromagnetic waves in a volume of disordered medium [3], [4], where

the impureties are modeled by dielectric spherical scatterers, and the role played by the

backscattering mechanism in the energy localization was established. The physical basis of

the localization is a consequence of the vanishing of diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the electromag-

netic wave energy, this condition was then called a localization criterion.

The purpose of this paper is to analytically determine several conditions on the param-

eters of some disordered systems (namely, the number of scatterers, their size, permittivity,

geometry, the width of the medium) satisfying a localization criterion of the electromagnetic

energy, and to show their inﬂuence on the wavelength localization domains [5]. We give

the analytic expressions of the localization criterion for a spherical or layered medium made

of dielectric spheres or perfectly conducting disks. We numerically determine the sets of

parameters oﬀering ranges in wavelength where the localization criterion is satisﬁed. More

precisely, we compute the evolution of the range when we modify every parameter, and we

show that the location and the bandwitdh of these ranges may be controlled by varying

some characteristic parameters of the disordered system.

This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, we recall in Section 2 the

mathematical model used to describe the behaviour of the electromagnetic wave in a disor-

dered medium, and the expression of a localization criterion. Then in Section 3, we derive

analytically a localization criterion for several disordered media. In Section 4, we numeri-

cally compute the localization criterion for these media in order to determine localization

domains, and we examine the inﬂuence of the system parameters on these localization do-

mains. Computations with a multidipolar formulation are used for comparison with the

theoretical model. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to the conclusions.

II. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL

We consider N identical scatterers of relative permittivity ¯¯ǫs(ω) distributed in a spatial

volume V . The location of scatterers is given by the vector −→Rp, p

[1, N]. The background

∈

medium has a relative permittivity ǫ0. An incident electromagnetic plane wave of pulsation

ω, and wavevector k0 =

√ǫ0, interacts with the set of scatterers (ﬁgure 1).

The electric ﬁeld −→E (−→r , ω) at location −→r satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation

with the relative permittivity of the medium, where the components are given by

A. The Green’s formalism

In order to solve the Helmholtz Eq. (5), we ﬁrst introduce the dyadic Green function

gij(−→r , −→r′ , ω) [6] which determines the wave at location −→r generated by a pointlike cur-
rent source located in −→r′ . Its components satisfy the Helmholtz equation

∆gij(−→r , −→r′ , ω) +

The dyadic Green functions are deﬁned by the kernels of the operators. The operator δV

in Eq. (7) is deﬁned as the multiplicative operator, and the direct product between two

successive operators is written as a point.

Using this formalism, we can rewrite the integral equation like

The calculation of the kernel of

knowledge of the 3N space coordinates relative to the location of scatterers. Due to their

complexity, we introduce a statistical approach of the problem. We call ρN (−→R1...−→RN ) the

probability density of location of the N scatterers in the medium [7], and we introduce the

3. Macroscopic homogenization of the disordered medium - Scalar formulation

We use the hypothesis of macroscopic homogenization of the disordered medium in order

to calculate the kernel of IE

, i.e., the dyadic Green function of the averaged wave. We

suppose that after averaging, the medium behaves like a homogeneous one, which implies

G
(cid:16)

an invariance under translation. In consequence, we can ﬁrst write the Dyson equation (16)

like a convolution equation

The other consequence of the macroscopic homogenization hypothesis is the possibility to

write a scalar form of the previous equation. Indeed, the averaged medium being homoge-

neous, the kernel of IE

may be written as

(cid:16)

is the ﬁrst moment of the scalar Green function of the electromagnetic

wave. The same consideration holds for the kernel of the self-energy operator. Extracting

where we notice that the invariance by translation of the averaged medium implies that the

ﬁrst moment of the Green function and the self energy function in Fourier space are only

−→k dependent. IE(G) is the scalar Green function of the homogenized medium.

The argument of Sheng [4] is to treat the averaged medium like an eﬀective medium,

where the characteristic length of the averaged inhomogenities is small with respect to

the wavelength, and therefore, they are not resolved by the wave, which explains that the

averaged medium may be considered like a homogeneous one. In that case, the self-energy

function Σ describing the local microstructures of the medium, is weakly dependent on the

variable −→k , so it is treated like a pulsation dependent function Σ(ω).

If this condition is satisﬁed, the ﬁrst moment of the Green function physically represents

a propagative wave of eﬀective wavevector ˜k2

e = k2

0 + Σ(ω), from which we deduce the

wavevector of the wave

(25)

The decreasing factor in the expression of the ﬁrst moment of the Green function shows

the fact that during the path in the averaged medium, the wave loses its phase coherence

over a characteristic length given by l, as a consequence of the successive scatterings. Over

a distance of several scattering lengths l, the ﬁrst moment of the Green function becomes

negligible. In order to describe the behaviour of the electromagnetic wave for large distances,

we need to investigate the second moment of the dyadic Green function.

of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is a consequence of the backscattering eﬀect of the electromagnetic

The energy of the electromagnetic wave is said to be localized when the general diﬀusion co-

eﬃcient (30) vanishes, i.e. the corrective term generated by the backscattering compensates

the Boltzmann diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which gives us the condition

III. CALCULATION OF THE LOCALIZATION CRITERION

FOR SEVERAL MEDIA

We propose to derive an analytic expression of the localization criterion for an electromag-

2π
k0

netic wave of wavelength λ0 =

interacting with the two following sets of media.

- A set of N identical dielectric spheres of radius a and relative permittivity ǫs, uniformly

distributed in a spherical volume V , or in a layered volume of thickness ez (ﬁgure 2).

- A set of N identical perfectly conducting disks of radius a and relative permittivity ǫs,

uniformly distributed in a spherical volume V , or in a layered volume of thickness ez (ﬁgure

3).

The deﬁnitions of the averaged wavevector ke and the scattering length l are given by the

relations (24) and (25). To express the ke.l product, we have to calculate the self-energy

function for every disordered medium.

8

A. Macroscopic homogenization conditions

First, we need to verify some conditions on the media in order to consider them as macroscop-

ically homogeneous, which means that the self-energy function must be only k dependent.

The self-energy function in Fourier space for a medium of N identical scatterers of scat-

tering function t(−→k , −→k ′) is given by

. In the following we have computed the ke.l

ke.l(λ). Then we will look for the inﬂuence of the system parameters on the localization,

for instance: the number N, the width a of the scatterers and for the case of spheres, their

permittivity ǫs, the volume V of the medium. In our simulations, we have supposed that

the relative permittivity ǫs is weakly dependent on the pulsation, so we have treated it as a

scalar. However, it is possible to give a description by a frequency law dependent upon the

The ﬁrst medium we study is an array of N dielectric spheres of radius a, permittivity

ǫs, uniformly distributed in a volume V of radius R. We numerically found a localization

domain for the following set of parameters (ﬁgure 4)

working in the range k.a < 1, and only the ﬁrst term of the expansion (40) was used in the

calcultations of the scattering function for the spheres.

Now, we will investigate the eﬀect of the parameters on the localization domain.

We show in ﬁgure 5, the localization curves for several values of the spheres radius. The

dotted curve is taken for reference (a = 0.01µ). When the value of a decreases (0.095µ)

(plain curve), the minimum of the curve occurs for lower wavelength, the corresponding

value of the ke.l product increases and the localization domain narrows. Oppositely, when

the radius is increased (0.0105µ)(dashed curve), the minimum of the localization curve

occurs for higher wavelength, the corresponding value of the ke.l product decreases and the

localization domain enlarges.

In ﬁgure 6, we start from the reference conﬁguration, and we modify the relative permit-

tivity of spheres. The curves are shown for the values: ǫ = 15 (plain curve), ǫ = 16 (dotted

curve) and ǫ = 17 (dashed curve). When we slightly increase the relative permittivity of the

spheres, the localization domain enlarges with a translation to higher wavelengths.

Next, we have ﬁxed the real part of the permittivity (Re(ǫ) = 16), and we simulate a

absorption on the surface of spheres by adding an imaginary part to the relative permittivity,

so we obtain a dissipative dielectric. The ﬁgure 7 shows the localization curves for the

respective values 0 (plain curve), 0.4 (dotted curve), 0.8 (dashed curve) and 1.2 (long dashed

curve) of the imaginary part of the relative permittivity. When the value of the imaginary

part increases, the value of the minimum of the localization curve also increases and the

localization domain narrows and ﬁnally disappear. By adding an imaginary part to the

relative permittivity, the scatterers absorb a part of the electromagnetic energy and the

interactions during successive scatterings are reduced, which explains the disappearance of

An other interesting parameter is the density n =

.

Indeed, when we increase the

density of scatterers, we also increase the backscattering contributions from the successive

interactions of the wave with scatterers, as a consequence the localization is more easily

attained.

We verify the inﬂuence upon the number N of scatterers in a ﬁxed volume medium.

The Figure 8 shows the localization curves corresponding to N = 1 million (plain curve),

N =1.5 millions (dotted curve) and N =2 millions (dash curve) spheres. When the number

of scatterers increases, we observe a deepening of the localization curve minimum and a

broadening of the localization domain. The inverse phenomenon was obtained when we ﬁx

the number of spheres and at the same time increase the radius of the medium. Figure 9

shows the localization curve for the radius R values 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 µ respectively.

In that case, the minimum of the localization curve increases with R and the localization

domain disappears. The localization gradually vanishes because the medium is diluted, so

the interactions between the scatterers are reduced. In both cases, the N or R variations

show that the location of the minimums are weakly dependent, it means that one can choose

a conﬁguration giving a central vawelength localization, and then modify the width of the

localization domain around this value by the mean of medium density.

In the next part, we only focuse on the density eﬀect.

In the following example, we consider N dielectric spheres uniformly distributed in a

The ﬁgure 11 presents the localization curves when the number N of spheres takes

respectively the values: 105 (plain curve), 1.2105 (dotted curve) and 1.5105 (dashed curve),

the other parameters are kept ﬁxed. We observe that the minimum of the curves diminishes

13

with the increase of N and the localization domain enlarges. Then, if we ﬁx the number of

spheres N = 105, and modify the thickness ez of the layer with respect to the macroscopic

homogenization condition. The ﬁgure 12 shows the curves obtained for ez = 1µ (plain

curve), ez = 1.5µ (dotted curve) and ez = 1.8µ (dashed curve). The minimum of the curves

increases with the thickness ez of the layer, the localization domain narrows and ﬁnally

disappears. The observed eﬀects are the same as in the case of a spherical volume.

In a second series of tests, we replace the spheres by perfectly conducting disks, oriented

following a plane perpendicular to the wavevector (ﬁgure 3).

For the two respective media (spherical and layered), we numerically ﬁnd a localization

domain for the set of parameters in a spherical volume (ﬁgure 13),

Figures 15 and 16 show the localization curves for the spherical volume case when we vary

respectively the number of disks and the radius of the volume. In ﬁgure 15, the volume radius

is ﬁxed, R = 15µ, and the number N takes the values 1 billion (plain curve), 1.5 billions

(dotted curve) and 2 billions (dashed curve), for this last value, the localization domain is

located in the range [0.45 µ, 0.72 µ], it is larger compared to the case N=1.5 billion ([0.45 µ,

0.60 µ]). In ﬁgure 16, we have ﬁxed N at 1 billion and computed localization curves for R =

10 µ (plain curve), R=12.5 µ (dotted curve), and R = 15 µ (dashed curve). In the last case,

14

the minimum of the localization curve is 1.1 for λ = 5µ, but there is no more localization.

The same eﬀects occur in the case of a layered medium. When we increase the number

of disks (ﬁgure 17) the localization domain enlarges, oppositely, when the thickness of the

medium increases (ﬁgure 18), the localization range narrows and disappears.

B. A Numerical check

In order to numerically control the behaviour of the electromagnetic ﬁeld near a localiza-

tion range, we have used a multidipolar diﬀusion formulation [10]. The principle consists to

discretize a dielectric sphere of radius a < λ by an array of dipoles [11], and to compute the

scattered ﬁeld using a multidipolar expansion. To characterize the scattered ﬁeld, we use

the intensity functions Iij(θ) described in [12], where i and j respectively refer to the polar-

ization of the incident and scattered electric ﬁeld, θ is the scattering angle. More precisely,

we are interested by the intensity behaviour around the backscattering direction, where the

localization phenomenon manifests by the creation of a backscattering peak.

We compute the averaged intensity functions by supposing the disordered medium er-

godic, which means that the mathematical expectation value of the intensity function is

obtained by averaging intensity functions on a large number of disordered medium conﬁgu-

rations.

Due to the large number of spheres we used for computations, we simplify the problem

by modeling a little sphere by a single dipole located at its center.

C. Case of a spherical volume

We ﬁrst use the localization parameters previously obtained for the set of spheres in

a spherical volume to compute the averaged intensity functions. In this model, a number

of spheres around 1 million is too large to be handled by numerical computations. But

we notice that the fundamental parameter which occurs in the localization criterion is the

15

N
V

density n =

. To simulate an equivalent conﬁguration, we deﬁne a medium of the same

density but with a smaller number of spheres. However, the consequence is also to reduce

the radius of the medium, and then alterate the macroscopic homogenization condition (34).

We choose the set of the following parameters: R = 0.2µ and N = 1000. The localization

parameters are then

N = 1000

a = 0.01 µ

ǫs=16

R = 0.2 µ

λ

[0.0805µ, 0.083µ]

∈

We propose to compute the intensity functions for several values of N, when we approach

a localization range (i.e., N

1000). Figure 19 shows the intensity functions Ixx(θ) (in

→

arbitray units) for the respective values of N =300,500,700,900. We notice the appearance

of a peak in the backscattering direction when the value of N approaches the theoretical

value of N given by the mathematical model (N=1000).

D. Case of a layered medium

We use the localization parameters given for the set of spheres in a layered volume to

compute the averaged intensity functions. Like in the previous example, the number of

spheres is too large for a numerical computation. To overcome this diﬃculty, we use an

equivalent medium with the same density.

We choose the set of equivalent parameters: ex = 0.3µ, ey = 0.3µ, ez = 0.28µ and

N = 800 . The localization parameters are then

N = 800

a = 0.01µ

ǫs = 16

16

ex = ey = 0.3µ

ez = 0.28µ

λ

[0.081µ, 0.083µ]

∈

We present the intensity function curves Ixx(θ) when the number of spheres N have

respectively the values 200, 400, 600, 800 (ﬁgure 20). We also observe a backscattering peak

when N tends to the initial value where one observes an electromagnetic energy localization

in the mathematical model.

V. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES

We have analytically calculated the value of the ke.l product as a function of the incident

wavelength in order to ﬁnd wavelength domains satisfying the localization criterion ke.l

≤
in diﬀerent media. We have considered some conﬁgurations where the volume may be

s
ﬁnite or inﬁnite, and the scatterers are dielectric spheres or perfectly conducting little disks.

π

We have studied the inﬂuence of electromagnetic system parameters on the localization

domain, for instance, the complex permittivity of spheres, their radius, their number and

the dimensions of the surrounding medium. Computations have shown that the density

oﬀers the optimal way to adjust the width of the localization domain.

The multidipolar model allowed us to detect a backscattering peak when the system

parameters are closed to the localization parameters provided with the theoretical model.

Many works were already realized in order to calculate the expression of the backscattering

peak [4], [13], however these results were not related to the localization criterion. This

peak, predicted by the theoretical model, occurs from the crossed diagrams contribution

[2] responsible of the backscattering, it represents a ﬁrst manifestation of the localization

phenomenon. However, we were limited by the size of the matrix describing the system, and

the conditions where the medium is macroscopically homogeneous were not exactly fulﬁlled.

The same matrix limitation implies that we have, in the simulation, described a little sphere

by a single dipole. A way to perform a more realistic simulation would consist to describe

17

the sphere itself by a set of dipoles located on a cubic lattice inside the sphere [11].

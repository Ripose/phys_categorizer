We study the formation of dark-bright vector soliton pairs in nonlocal Kerr-type nonlinear medium. We
show, by analytical analysis and direct numerical calculation, that in addition to stabilize vector soliton pairs
nonlocal nonlinearity also helps to reduce the threshold power for forming a guided bright soliton. With help of
the nonlocality, it is expected that the observation of dark-bright vector soliton pairs in experiments becomes
more workable.

Recently the study of nonlocal nonlinearity brings new
features in solitons,1 such as modiﬁcation of modulation
instability2 and azimuthal instability,3 suppression of
collapse in multidimensional solitons,4 change of the soli-
ton interaction,5 and formation of soliton bound states.6
Nonlocal eﬀect comes to play an important role as the
characteristic response function of the medium is compa-
rable to the transverse content of the wave packet. Ex-
perimental observations of nonlocal response also have
been demonstrated in various systems, such as pho-
torefractive crystals,7 nematic liquid crystals,8 thermo-
optical materials,9 and 52Cr Bose-Einstein condensates
with strong dipole-dipole interaction.10

For nonlinear local media, dark-dark, bright-bright, or
dark-bright soliton pairs can exist in normal or anoma-
lous dispersion region in vector settings in contrast to
the scalar models.11, 12 Especially with the help of a
dark soliton, a bright soliton in normal dispersive me-
dia is formed through soliton-induced guiding eﬀect.13
With nonlocal nonlinearity, a large number of multi-
hump multi-component vector solitons are found with a
remarkable stabilization.14 For nonlocal Kerr-type non-
linear medium, the nonlocality is known to improve the
stabilization of solitons due to the diﬀusion mechanism
of the nonlinearity. The price to pay is that nonlocal
solitons also need to increase their formation power to
compensate the diﬀusion eﬀect in nonlocal materials. In
this Letter, we study vector solitons with dark-bright
pairs in nonlocal nonlinear media. We reveal that stable
bright solitons can be formed in normal dispersive re-
gion guided by dark soliton backgrounds. Moreover we
ﬁnd that the nonlocal nonlinearity also helps to reduce
the threshold power for such a guided bright soliton due
to the combination of nonlocality and vectorial coupling.

We consider two mutually incoherent wave packet
propagating along the ξ axis within a nonlocal Kerr-
type nonlinear medium. The governing equations of the
vectorial Manakov system which consists of two vector

components U and V are given by,

where η is the transverse coordinates, n(ξ, η) is the re-
fractive index proﬁle induced by the exponential-type
diﬀusion kernel function R(η) responding to the intensity
soliton intensity.15 The coeﬃcient d stands for the de-
gree of nonlocality which governs the diﬀusion strength
of refractive index. With the nonlocal vector model in
Eq. (1-4), stationary solutions in form of V (ξ, η) =
v(η)exp(iµvξ) and U (ξ, η) = u(η)exp(iµuξ) are assumed
to be the solution of dark-bright vector soliton pairs with
real propagation constants, µv and µu, respectively. The
two component solutions of dark-bright vector soliton
pairs are subject to the boundary condition u(
) = 0
and v(

±∞

) =

√µv.

The solutions of dark-bright vector soliton pairs in
local and nonlocal media, as well as the refractive in-
dex proﬁles, are shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b). The
dependence of the power for bright component, deﬁned
in Eq.(9), and its propagation constant µu is plotted in
Fig. 1 (c). As the case in scalar model, a bright soli-
ton in nonlocal media has higher cutoﬀ potential than
the local one due to the diﬀusion of the nonlinear in-
dex. In Figure 2, the relations between the propagation
constant for bright soliton µu and the degree of nonlo-
cality d at diﬀerent ﬁxed powers are shown. It can be
seen that the propagation constant of the bright one in
a dark-bright soliton system is growing as the degree of
nonlocality increases, for the bright component sees a
potential directly from the nonlinear index that is raised
due to the diﬀusion nonlocality in response to the inten-
sity sum of the dark-bright soliton pair. But in contrast

to the scalar soliton in local media,16 the bright soliton
guided by a dark soliton in vector model requires lower
forming power in nonlocal region as the same propaga-
tion constant is concerned, as the marked points A and
B shown in Fig. 1 (c).

In addition to direct numerical treatments, we exam-
ine the formation power of bright soliton in nonlocal
media analytically by variational methods. To simplify
the analysis, a constant dark pulse is assumed as the
background and the Lagrangian equation for the bright
soliton in a vectorial nonlinear nonlocal system has the
form,

is the expansion of the Fourier transform, H(ω), of the
kernel function R(η) in Eq. (4). To solve the Lagrangian
equation in Eq. (5), we use following solution ansatz for
the bright and dark solitons,

 

U (η) = Ausech(η/au)exp(iφu + icuη2),
V (η) = Avtanh(η/av)exp(iφv + icvη2),

where the parameters Aj , aj, φj and cj, (j = U, V )
are amplitude, width, phase, and chirp for bright and
dark solitons, separately. By assuming that dark soliton
is invariant to the change of the degree of nonlocality in
the low nonlinear limit, a set of Euler-Lagrangian equa-
tions for Au, au,φu and cj can be obtained. Furthermore,
˙φu = µu is a constant,
we assume that in steady state,
and cj is zero for chirpless soliton solutions. Then for a
set of propagation constants of dark-bright soliton pairs,
µv and µu, an approximate linear dependence of bright
soliton power versus nonlocality is derived as,

tons, our analytical model shows a linear dependence of
the formation power for bright solitons on the degree
of nonlocality and also matches the numerical simula-
tions very well. With the reduction of forming threshold
power, we believe that our results are very useful for the
observation of dark-bright vector soliton pairs in nonlo-
cal nonlinear media.

soliton in vector model decreases as the degree of the
nonlocality increases. In addition, when d = 0, Eq. (9)
reduces to the case of soliton solutions in the local me-
dia.17 In Fig. 3, we show the dependence of threshold
power for forming bright solitons with the degree of non-
locality both by direct numerical simulation of Eq. (1-4)
and the Lagrangian equation in Eq. (5), which is con-
sistent with the results in Fig. 1(c). In this case we ﬁx
µv to 1 since it is associated with the dark component
which is given by the boundary conditions and can be
scaled out. Conceptually, as the degree of nonlocality in-
creases, the tendency for refractive index to advance to
the region of lower light intensity grows stronger. Even
though the dark pulse almost remains unchanged, the
existence of bright pulse drives out index ﬂow. Conse-
quently the index modulation induced by the soliton pair
becomes shallower, and the nonlinearity required to form
the bright soliton decreases. The power of bright soliton
decreases in a dynamical balance with the refractive in-
dex ﬂow. This implies that the threshold power to form
a bright soliton guided in the dark background can be
reduced with nonlocal interaction.

The stability of dark-bright soliton pairs in nonlocal
nonlinear media is analyzed by standard linear stability
analysis with introduction of perturbations solutions, i.e.

U = eiµuξ[u0 + (pu + iqu)eλξ + (p∗u + iq∗u)eλ
V = eiµv ξ[v0 + (pv + iqv)eλξ + (p∗v + iq∗v)eλ

where the small perturbations grow at the rate of the
real part of λ. As the case in local media,18 dark-bright
soliton pairs in Manakov model are stable in the nonlocal
nonlinear media.

In conclusion, we study the formation of dark-bright
soliton pairs in vectorial nonlocal nonlinear model ana-
lytically and numerically. We ﬁnd that in addition to the
stabilization of vector soliton pairs, nonlocal nonlinear-
ity also helps to reduce the threshold power for forming
a guided bright soliton due to the dynamical balance be-
tween the nonlinearity and nonlocal induced refractive

We calculate the static dielectric tensor of a periodic system of aligned anisotropic

dielectric cylinders. Exact analytical formulas for the eﬀective dielectric constants

for the E- and H- eigenmodes are obtained for arbitrary 2D Bravais lattice and

arbitrary cross-section of anisotropic cylinders. It is shown that depending on the

symmetry of the unit cell photonic crystal of anisotropic cylinders behaves in the

low-frequency limit like uniaxial or biaxial natural crystal. The developed theory of

homogenization of anisotropic cylinders is applied for calculations of the dielectric

properties of photonic crystals of carbon nanotubes.

INTRODUCTION

Periodic dielectric structures - photonic crystals (PC) - have found many useful techno-

logical applications.1 Progress in the development of optical devices that operate using the

principles of the control of light as proposed by Yablonovich2 gave rise to theoretical studies

of the general properties of the spectra of PC’s.3 In particular, the region of low frequencies,

where the ideas and methods of the theory of homogenization4 are applicable, has attracted

a signiﬁcant amount of attention in the last decade. In the low-frequency limit the light

wave in a non-absorbable periodic medium has linear dispersion, ω

k. This allows the

In the general case, this eﬀective parameter depends on the direction of propagation ˆk =

k/k and has tensor structure. The latter property is emphasized for 2D PC’s, which are

anisotropic uniaxial or biaxial crystals, depending on the symmetry of the unit cell.5 Unlike

this, 3D PC’s may be isotropic.6

Optical anisotropy of the PC’s studied in Refs.

[5,6,7] is determined by the geometry of

the unit cell only. The constituents themselves are considered to be isotropic dielectrics.

This is not the case, for example, for a structure of aligned carbon nanotubes arranged

periodically in the plane perpendicular to the tubes. Here anisotropy manifests itself at the

”microscopic” level, since the nanotubes (”atoms” of the PC) possess a natural anisotropy.

This anisotropy originates from the layered structure of the crystal of graphite, which has

diﬀerent dielectric constants along the c-axis and in the perpendicular plane. The static

values of these dielectric constants are εk = 1.8225 and ε⊥ = 5.226.15 The elongated topology

and the natural anisotropy of graphite cause PC’s of carbon nanotubes to exhibit large

optical anisotropy.8 Three-dimensional PC’s with anisotropic dielectric spheres have been

studied in Refs.[9]. It was shown, that, depending on the symmetry of the unit cell, the

anisotropy of the spheres may be favorable for either broadening or narrowing the band

gaps.

High anisotropy of 2D photonic crystals may ﬁnd interesting applications in nanophoton-

ics as it was recently proposed by Artigas and Torner.10 Namely, the surface of an anisotropic

2D photonic crystal supports propagation of a surface wave predicted by Dyakonov.11 The

surface mode does not radiate and is localized close to the surface due to the interference

between the ordinary and extraordinary waves.

In natural crystals, it can be hardly ob-

served because of the low anisotropy. Since it is a surface wave with very low energy losses,

the Dyakonov wave may replace surface plasmons in the near-ﬁeld optics and integrated

photonic circuits.

An eﬀective medium theory for the PC of anisotropic carbon nanotubes was proposed in

Ref.

[12]. This theory is based on the Maxwell-Garnet approximation.13 and it leads to a

simple analytical formula for the eﬀective dielectric constant. The formula is valid at low

3

ﬁlling fractions. Since the Maxwell-Garnett approximation does not discriminate between

periodic and non-periodic arrangements of the nanotubes, the in-plane anisotropy of the
eﬀective dielectric constant is lost. In other words, εef f in Eq. (1) is independent on ˆk, i.e.,

the Maxwell-Garnet approximation always leads to an eﬀective medium which is equivalent

to a uniaxial crystal. The PC considered in Ref. [12] has a square unit cell that gives rise to

in-plane isotropy of the eﬀective dielectric tensor.

In this paper we extend the results of the theory of homogenization5 to the case of

anisotropic dielectric cylinders. Exact analytical formulas are obtained for the princi-

pal eﬀective dielectric constants of a 2D PC with an arbitrary cross-sectional form of

anisotropic cylinders, arbitrary Bravais lattice, and ﬁlling fraction. We compare our re-

sults with the results obtained for the PC of carbon nanotubes in the modiﬁed Maxwell-

Garnet approximation.12 This comparison shows that the Maxwell-Garnett approximation

gives correct results for a dilute system with ﬁlling fraction less then 5%. However, at higher

ﬁlling fractions the Maxwell-Garnet approximation overestimates the values for the eﬀective

dielectric constant. For a close-packed structure the error is about 10%. We also consider

a PC with a rectangular unit cell and calculate two diﬀerent in-plane dielectric constants.

In this case the corresponding eﬀective medium is a biaxial crystal.

It was argued that

for the H-polarized mode the eﬀective dielectric constant for hollow and solid cylinders are

practically indistinguishable.12 Using our approach, we study the eﬀect of the internal cavity

on the eﬀective dielectric constant and show explicitly how the eﬀective dielectric constant

decreases with the internal radius.

II. THE FOURIER EXPANSION METHOD IN THE LONG-WAVELENGTH

LIMIT

We consider a 2D periodic structure of dielectric cylinders with their axes parallel to

z and whose cross section can have an arbitrary shape. The cylinders are imbedded in

a dielectric matrix. A 2D PC supports propagation of two uncoupled modes with either

E-polarization (where the vector E is parallel to the cylinders), or H-polarization (in this

case the vector H is parallel to the cylinders). The background material is an isotropic

dielectric with permittivity εb and the cylinders are rolled up from an anisotropic dielectric
sheet characterized by a tensor ˆε(a). For carbon nanotubes, this tensor has two diﬀerent

eigenvalues, and in cylindrical coordinates is represented by a diagonal matrix with elements
ε(a)
θθ = ε(a)
characterized by the coordinate-dependent dielectric tensor,

rr = εk. As a whole, the periodic inhomogeneous dielectric medium is

The determinant in the right-hand side can be written as a product of two eigenvalues.

Within the graphite wall of the cylinders this product is εkε⊥. Outside the wall it is either
(ε(b))2 (for r being outside the cylinders) or 1 for the interior region of the cylinder, which

is free from the dielectric material.

Eq.(3) depends only on the zz component of the dielectric tensor, i.e., it is insensitive to

the in-plane anisotropy. Therefore the eﬀective dielectric constant in the long-wavelength

limit is the same as for the parallel arrangement of isotropic cylinders (not necessarily

periodic). It is given by a simple formula

the interior of the hollow cylinders respectively. Substituting Eqs. (8) and (9) into Eq. (4)

we get a generalized eigenvalue problem in G-space,

Eq. (11) is an inﬁnite set of homogeneous linear equations for the eigenfunctions hk(G).

The dispersion relation ω = ωn(k) (n = 1, 2, . . .) is obtained from the condition that this set

has non-trivial solutions.

The periodic medium behaves as a homogeneous one if the Bloch wave (8) approaches

a plane wave. This occurs if the Fourier coeﬃcients with G

= 0 in (8) vanish in the long-

wavelength limit. To obtain the behavior of hk(G) we substitute G = 0 in both sides of Eq.

(11), divide the both sides by hk(G = 0) and take the limit as k

in the right-hand side are inversely proportional to k. In order to make the sum ﬁnite, the

amplitudes of non-zero harmonics, h⋆

k(G′) must approach zero linearly with k. Thus, in the

long-wavelength limit the Bloch wave (8) can be written as a linear expansion over powers

Since the sum over G vanishes linearly with k, Eq. (13) shows that the medium becomes

homogeneous, i.e. the solution of the wave equation (4) approaches a plane wave with an

amplitude h0 = hk(G = 0) when k

0.

Now, to calculate the eﬀective dielectric constant (1), we develop a theory of perturbation

with respect to a small parameter ka (a is the lattice period). In Eq. (11) we keep the linear

terms and obtain the following relation,

The quadratic approximation is given by Eq.

between the eigenvectors h⋆

k(G). Note that this relation is obtained from the eigenvalue

problem Eq. (11) for G = 0 and the linear approximation Eq. (14) is obtained for G

= 0.

The linear relations, Eqs.

(12) and (14), are the homogenized equations for the Fourier

components of the magnetic ﬁeld. These equations are consistent, if the corresponding

determinant vanishes:

Since Eqs. (12) and (14) are homogenous with respect to k, the dispersion equation (15)

depends only on the inverse eﬀective dielectric constant, (ω/ck)2. This fact is a manifestation

of a general property: At low frequencies an electromagnetic wave has a linear dispersion in

a periodic dielectric medium.

Although Eq. (15) is an inﬁnite-order polynomial equation in Λ, it turns out that it has

only a unique nonzero solution. The fact that the second term in the determinant Eq. (15)

is a product of two factors, one of which depends only on G and the other only on G′, plays

a crucial role. Omitting the mathematical details, which can be found in Ref. [5], we obtain

the ﬁnal answer for the inverse eﬀective dielectric constant obtained from Eq. (15) as:

crystal, and the direction of propagation in the plane of periodicity.

In the case when

aij(G) = η(G) δij Eq. (16) is reduced to the formula obtained for isotropic cylinders.5

by an index ellipsoid.14 Taking into account Eq. (6) the equation for this ellipsoid can be

ˆz, i.e. the z0 direction coincides with z-axis. In the x

y plane the cross section of

the index ellipsoid is given by Eq. (16), which can be rewritten in the canonical form as

Eq.

ef f (ϕ) gives the index of refraction of H-mode and the angle ϕ is related to the direction

of propagation, ˆn = (cos ϕ, sin ϕ). The directions x0 and y0 coincide with the semi-axes of

the ellipse given by Eq. (18) and the in-plane indices of refraction √ε1, √ε2 are given by
the lengths of the semi-axes. The angle of rotation of the axes of the ellipse Eq. (18) with

respect to the arbitrary axes x, y, is given by the relation

If the unit cell possesses a third- or higher-order rotational axis z, then the tensor Aij is

reduced to a scalar, Aij = Aδij, and the ellipse given by Eq. (18) is reduced to a circle. In

this case the PC in the long-wavelength limit behaves like a uniaxial crystal; otherwise, it

is biaxial.

IV. UNIAXIAL AND BIAXIAL PC’S OF SOLID GRAPHITE CYLINDERS

vectors. Because of the high symmetry of the unit cell, the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the

tensor aik(G) vanish. The diagonal elements for hollow cylinders with outer and inner radii

In this section we consider solid cylinders, i.e. γ

≡

eﬀective dielectric constant, given by Eq. (18), of the H-mode as a function of the ﬁlling

fraction, f = πR2/Ac, for uniaxial PC with a square lattice. The number of G values (plane

waves) considered in this calculation was 1200, which provided a good convergence in Eq.

(18). The dielectric constant for the extra-ordinary mode (E-mode), Eq. (6) (shown by

triangles in Fig. 1) is always larger than that for the ordinary wave (H-mode). Therefore,

the eﬀective medium is a uniaxial positive optically anisotropic crystal. To check the validity

of the Maxwell-Garnett approximation, we plot in Fig. 1 (squares) the eﬀective dielectric

constant proposed in Ref. [12]

system, f < 0.07, the Maxwell-Garnett approximation gives results that are practically in-

cylinders the Maxwell-Garnet approximation overestimates the dielectric constant by about

diﬀerence between the two dielectric constants increases with the ﬁlling fraction, giving

rise to a higher anisotropy of the corresponding eﬀective medium. The Maxwell-Garnett

approximation Eq. (23), which does not take into account the anisotropy of the unit cell,

gives the values for εM G that lie between the two principal values, ε1 < εM G < ε2.

V. UNIAXIAL PHOTONIC CRYSTAL OF CARBON NANOTUBES

In our model we consider the carbon nanotubes as hollow graphite cylinders.

In the

experimental study8 of the dielectric properties of carbon nanotues the outer radius of the

cylinders was approximately R = 5 nm. The nanotubes formed a thin ﬁlm and they were

oriented along a speciﬁc direction. Although the nanotubes were not necessarily arranged

periodically, one can assume that they formed almost a regular lattice, since the nanotube

density is about 0.6 - 0.7 which is near the value of fc = π/4

0.785 for a close-packed

≈

structure. Thus, the separation between the nanotubes (the period of the square lattice

d) slightly exceeds 2R, and in Ref.

[12] it was estimated to be d = 10.15 nm. The inner

radius γR = 0.25

2 nm.12 was evaluated from the amount of electromagnetic absorption

for the E-polarized light. The four parameters f , R, γ, and Ac = a2 are not independent

dielectric constant is shown by the squares.

f = πR2(1

(24)

Substituting the aforementioned parameters of the square unit cell into this formula allows

one to check that they are self-consistent. It is worthwhile to mention that the background

material in the experiment8 is not air but the host material Delrin or Teﬂon with εb > 1.

Since neither the density of the host material nor its dielectric constant is known, one cannot

expect very good agreement between the experimental results8 and theory. In all theoretical

considerations it was assumed that εb = 1. Because of this lack of experimental data, the

eﬀective medium theories12,16 and the results shown in Fig. 1 give lower values for εef f than

that observed in the experiment.8

It is obvious that the inner cavity reduces the permittivity of an isolated nanotube as

compared to a solid graphite cylinder of the same size. It was argued12 that for a periodic

arrangement the eﬀect of the inner cavity is less than that for a single cylinder and even

can be ignored, if the ratio between the inner and outer radii γ does not exceed 0.4. This

conclusion was supported by comparing the results of the Maxwell-Garnet approximation

Eq. (23) and numerical band structure calculations. In Fig. 3 we plot the dielectric constant

for a square lattice of hollow carbon nanotubes and compare the exact results obtained from

FIG. 3: The plot of the eﬀective dielectric constant for square lattice of carbon nanotubes versus

the outer radius for tubes with diﬀerent ratios of the inner and outer radii, γ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7.

The exact results are shown by circles and the results of the Maxwell-Garnett approximation are

shown by squares.

Eqs. (18), (19), and (22) (shown by the circles) with the results given by the Maxwell-

Garnett approximation (squares). One can see that, for the same outer radius, the eﬀective

dielectric constant drops with an increase of the inner radius. Thus, if the outer radius is

ﬁxed, the dependence on the inner radius cannot be ignored, even in the Maxwell-Garnett

approximation. However, the eﬀective dielectric constants exhibits much less sensitivity

to the internal radius if it is plotted as a function of the ﬁlling fraction, Fig. 4.

In the

Maxwell-Garnet approximation (23) there is no dependence on the parameter γ, therefore,

this approximation is represented by a single curve in Fig. 4. Here, only the total amount

of the dielectric material is important, but not the topology of the cylinders. In the exact

theory the eﬀective dielectric constant depends on the details of the microstructure of the

photonic crystal, but as far as the ﬁlling fraction is concerned, the topology plays a much

less important role. Since the cylinder is uniquely determined by either two parameters out

of three, R, γ, and f , the curves in Fig. 4 may cross each other. This means that at the

crossing point the values of f and γ correspond to the same hollow cylinder. This can be

easily seen from Eq. (24).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We calculated the low-frequency dielectric tensor for 2D photonic crystal of anisotropic

parallel cylinders arranged in a periodic lattice in the perpendicular plane. The exact ana-

lytical formula for the principal values of the dielectric tensor was obtained. The results are

applied for the periodic arrangement of carbon nanotubes which are rolled up from uniaxial

graphite crystal with static values of the dielectric tensor εk = 1.8225 and ε⊥ = 5.226. It was

shown that the interior (vacuum) region of the nanotubes has a small eﬀect on the dielectric

properties of the photonic crystal and can be ignored. Although we are interested in the

static dielectric tensor, it is clear that the developed long-wavelength limit approach remains

valid, even for optical frequencies since the period of the lattice of carbon nanotubes d = 10

nm is much less than the optical wavelength λ

500 nm. To calculate the dynamic dielectric

≈
tensor, one has to substitute in the general formula Eq. (16) the corresponding frequency-

dependent values for εk and ε⊥. Of course at ﬁnite frequencies Eq. (16) gives the real part

of the dielectric function. Calculations of the imaginary part require a generalization of the

presented theory. This result will be reported elsewhere.

The exact theory presented here allows a calculation of the eﬀective dielectric constant

13

of carbon nanotubes imbedded in a gas. Due to high absorbability of nanotubes, the con-

centration of gas in the interior region of the nanotubes may be diﬀerent from that in the

atmosphere. This leads to slightly diﬀerent dielectric constants of the material in the interior

and exterior regions of the cylinders. This eﬀect can be registered by precise measurements

of the shift of the resonant frequency of a resonant cavity.18 Thus, the proposed theory may

ﬁnd applications in the microwave detection of poisson gases in the atmosphere.

One more interesting application of carbon nantonube photonic crystal is related to its

huge anisotropy of the eﬀective dielectric constant. Recently Artigas and Torner10 demon-

strated that the electromagnetic surface wave (Dyakonov wave11) can propagate along the

surface of a photonic crystal with high optical anisotropy. This wave propagates in a loss-

less dielectric medium and decays much slower than the surface plasmon. Since crystals

with huge optical anisotropy are rare in nature, carbon nanotube photonic crystals may be

considered as a promising material for integrated photonic circuits.

We have monitored the space-time transformation of 150-fs pulse, undergoing self-focusing and ﬁl-
amentation in water, by means of the nonlinear gating technique. We have observed that pulse split-
ting and subsequent recombination apply to axial temporal intensity only, whereas space-integrated
pulse proﬁle preserves its original shape.

Spatial and temporal transformations of wave packets
which undergo self-focusing in transparent media with
Kerr nonlinearity attract a great deal of interest from
the point of view both of fundamental and applied sci-
ence. Self-focusing of ultrashort light pulses with power
well exceeding that for continuous-wave (CW) beam col-
lapse gives rise to a variety of spatial, temporal and
interrelated (spatio-temporal, ST) eﬀects and has been
a topic of intense theoretical and experimental research
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Discovery of a long range prop-
agation (ﬁlamentation) of ultrashort laser pulses in air
boosted an interest in ST transformation through ﬁla-
mentation dynamics in gasses [9, 10], solids [11] and liq-
uids [12, 13].

Numerical models of diﬀerent complexity have been
elaborated to study temporal, and, more generally, ST
dynamics. Propagation of intense light pulses in media
with rather distinct optical properties (amount of normal
GVD, nonlinearity, etc; namely gasses, solids and liquids)
under various initial conditions (pulse duration, beam
width, power, wavelength) has been examined. In spite
of diﬀerent regimes, temporal pulse splitting emerged as
a common feature resulting from the interplay between
self-focusing, self-phase-modulation and normal disper-
sion. The open question is then what happens after the
pulse splitting occurs. A scenario leading to subsequent
multiple splitting has been predicted, but not observed
directly (see the discussion in Ref [14] and references
therein). In Ref. [7] pulse recombination after splitting
has been observed and attributed to possible underlined
multiple splitting.

More recently, two interpretations have been proposed
for understanding ﬁlament formation in condensed mat-
ter. Some of the present Authors, after having experi-
mentally demonstrated that ﬁlaments cannot be treated
as a self guided beams, have outlined the key role plaid
by non-linear losses in ruling a spontaneous transforma-
tion from gaussian to conical (Bessel-like) wave, in the
frame of a CW model [15]. In this context, the conical

wave provides the beam with a large (and not absorbed)
power reservoir that keeps ”refuelling” the hot central
spot and so ensures stationarity, even in presence of non-
linear losses.
Independently from this work, a second
approach has been proposed [16] sharing with the ﬁrst
the genuine idea of ﬁlaments as non-soliton, but conical
waves. The important diﬀerence is that here the Au-
thors have outlined the key role of chromatic dispersion,
fully neglected in previous case, thus interpreting the ﬁl-
ament on the basis the dynamics of non-linear X waves
[17, 18, 19].

The major problem concerning the experimental char-
acterization of the wave packet dynamics is that most of
the measurements have been limited either to the pure
temporal domain, by on-axis auto or cross correlation
technique, or to the pure spatial one, by time integrated
CCD-based detection. An example of ST experimen-
tal characterization has been that reported in Ref [20].
The used technique, based on optical polarigraphy, has
shown indeed a quite poor resolution, and did not al-
lowed the ﬁne details of the ST structure to be recov-
ered. In a recent work related to the investigation of the
nonlinear dynamics of X-waves in quadratic non-linear
media some of the present authors have demonstrated
a very powerful, high ST resolution 3D-mapping tech-
nique, based on the use of ultrafast χ2 (sum-frequency,
SF) gate [19, 21]. The approach resembles the cross-
correlation measurement to some extent, but instead of
recording the space-integrated (or simply on-axis) signal,
here the entire space-resolved SF proﬁle is captured. The
whole wave-packet is then reconstructed from the assem-
bly of time slices recorded at diﬀerent delay times.

In this work we apply the same technique to provide a
complete characterization of the nonlinear ST dynamics
of ultrashort wave-packets in water. The results conﬁrm
the occurrence of the pulse recombination after splitting.
However the feature of the peripheral part of the beam
seems to indicate that observed recombination has to be
linked not to multiple splitting, but in contrast to refo-

cusing of the non-trapped portion of the beam [15, 16].

In our experiment, a light ﬁlament was excited by
launching a focused 0.9-µJ (P = 5Pcr, where Pcr =
1.15M W is the critical power for CW self-focusing), 150-
fs, 527-nm pulses into a syringe shaped water cell, using
focusing geometry as described in Ref. [12] (note that the
actual focal length is 50cm and not 50mm, as written in
Ref. [12] owing to typing mistake). The input pulses were
generated by a frequency up-converted optical paramet-
ric ampliﬁer (TOPAS, Light Conversion Ltd.), pumped
by 100-fs, 800-nm pulses delivered by Ti:Sapphire laser
system (Spitﬁre, Spectra Physics) at 1 kHz repetition
rate. A high contrast, 20-fs and 13-µJ probe pulse with
wavelength centered at 710 nm was provided by a non-
collinear optical parametric ampliﬁer (TOPAS White,
Light Conversion Ltd.) pumped by frequency doubled
Ti:Sapphire laser pulses. The non-linear gating was per-
formed via SF mixing the probe and the image of the out-
put wave-packet in a thin (20 µm) type I phase-matching
β-barium borate crystal under slightly noncollinear ge-
ometry. SF signal centered at 302 nm was then imaged
onto high dynamic range (16-bit) CCD camera (Andor
Technology). We employed a probe pulse with constant
intensity over large area (note 1 mm FWHM diameter)
and ensured that SF process is performed in the low con-
version limit. Then by spanning the delay t using 12 fs
steps (see Fig. 1), the complete intensity map I(x, y, t,
z) was retrieved, the ultimate temporal resolution being
deﬁned by the probe pulse width, by its front steepness
and by its intensity contrast.

Fig. 2 illustrates the full characterization of the wave-
packet at diﬀerent z, as obtained by changing the length

of the water cell. In the right panel we show the time-
integrated energy density (ﬂuence) distribution at the
output facet of the cell, as recorded by the CCD detector
using suitable imaging telescope. In the left panel we plot
the reconstructed ST intensity proﬁles (3D maps). We
note that the launched pulse has asymmetric temporal
proﬁle (see 3D map at z=0 mm in Fig. 2 with a shoulder
on its trailing edge). We expect that this shoulder, be-
cause of its low intensity, does not play a major role in
the nonlinear dynamics. The results show that a single
ﬁlament of ∼ 45µm FWHM diameter is formed, being
surrounded by oscillating annular ring structure. The
ST maps show evident pulse splitting on axis at z=22
mm, followed by pulse recombination at z=30mm. Out
of the beam axis intense modulated wings appear, whose
intensity remain peaked at the pulse central temporal

coordinate. This last feature is particularly important if
one accounts that the major part of the wave-packet en-
ergy is indeed contained into the outer part of the beam.
In fact, direct measurements by means of pinholes and
stoppers has shown that the ﬁlament contains only 20%
of the pulse total energy [15]. This feature is clariﬁed
also by the results in Fig. 3, where the temporal distri-
bution of the on-axis intensity and of the total power
(the space-integrated intensity) are compared. These re-
sults show that the widely used term ”pulse splitting”
is, at least in this case, incorrect. In fact, not the entire
wave-packet gets split in the time scale, but only the very
central (on-axis) portion of it. Indeed the power distri-
bution remains peaked at the pulse center at any value of
z. These results let us foresee that pulse recombination
could appear because of refocusing of a portion of the
power distributed in these intense outer rings. To our
opinion, these ﬁndings provide an indication of the fact
that the wave-packet is attempting a reshaping toward
a supported eigenmode of the system, either with domi-
nant Bessel type [15] or X-type [16] proﬁle, owing to the
interplay among self-focusing, dispersion and nonlinear
losses.

In conclusion, by using high-resolution, high dynamic
range detection of the ST intensity proﬁle, we have
demonstrated that pulse splitting and recombination of
intense, ultra-short pulses in water characterize just the
temporal intensity proﬁle at the beam center, but not the
pulse as a whole. The entire wave-packet dynamic seems
ruled by relevant energy exchange between the beam cen-
ter and the self-built, slowly decaying, oscillating tails.

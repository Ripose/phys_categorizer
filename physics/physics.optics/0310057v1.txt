Abstract

A method of formation of the tightly conﬁned distortion-free fs
pulses with the step-like decreasing of intensity under the ﬁnite-length
propagation in free space is described. Such pulses are formed by the
Fresnel source of a high refraction-index waveguide. The source re-
produces in free space a propagation-invariant (distortion-free) pulse
conﬁned by the waveguide. Converse to the case of material waveg-
uides, when the pulse goes out from the Fresnel (virtual) waveguide
its shape is not changed, but the intensity immediately drops down to
the near-zero level.

Tight transverse conﬁnement of a light wave in free space together with
fast decreasing of its intensity after the ﬁnite-length propagation are required
in many ﬁelds of optics, such as non-destroying light-matter interaction, con-
trol of light penetration-depth and surface processing. The eﬀect is usually
achieved by strong focusing a light beam by short-curvature-radius lenses
or spherical mirrors. In the case of fs pulses, the control of the transverse
and longitudinal intensity distributions is a particularly diﬃcult problem,
because the ultrashort pulses are distorted in the space and time domains by
such optical elements (see, for example Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). Recently, it
was shown that the tightly conﬁned propagation-invariant (distortion-free)
continuous waves with the fast decreasing of the intensity after the ﬁnite-
length propagation in free space could be formed by the Fresnel source of

1

a high refractive-index hollow waveguide having total-reﬂection walls [7, 8].
If such an eﬀect exists for the ultrashort pulses, this could be very impor-
tant for the fs optics and applications. In the present article, the formation
of tightly conﬁned distortion-free fs pulses with the step-like decreasing of
intensity under ﬁnite-length propagation in free space is described.

Let us describe the Fresnel source that reproduces in free space a propagation-

invariant (distortion-free) pulse tightly conﬁned by a high refractive-index
hollow waveguide with total-reﬂection walls. The plane-parallel guide hav-
ing the length Lw and width 2a is considered. A propagation-invariant time-
harmonic wave E′(x′, z, t, ω) is supported in the free-space by the construc-
tive interference of multiple beams E′
m(x′, z, t, ω) launching from the Fresnel
zones [xmin

where E0(x, 0, t, ω) is the ﬁeld at the guide entrance (z = 0). The value
M = M(z, dM ) is determined by the transverse dimension dM (k, a, z) of the
beam E′
M (x′, z, t, ω) at the guide exit (z = Lw). By analogy with the Fresnel
lens, the virtual source of the waveguide is called the Fresnel waveguide [8].
The source reproduces in free space a diﬀraction-free beam [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
In the case of an ultrashort pulse E′(x′, z, t)
conﬁned by the waveguide.
guided by the waveguide, the ﬁeld of the pulse at the guide entrance is
represented in the form of a Fourier integral F [E(x, z = 0, ω)]. Using the
Fresnel-waveguide representation for the Fourier components and substitut-
ing the result into the Fourier integral we get the propagation-invariant pulse
E′(x′, z, t) in free space [9]. The pulse is supported in free space by the con-
structive interference of the 2M(z) + 1 ultrashort-pulses launching from the
Fresnel source of the waveguide.

The Fresnel source reproduces in free space a distortion-free (propagation-
invariant) pulse conﬁned by the waveguide. Converse to the case of material
waveguides [15, 16], when the pulse goes out from the Fresnel (virtual) waveg-
uide its shape is not changed, but the intensity immediately drops down to
the near-zero level. The eﬀect, which looks like the instant decay or annihi-
lation of a tightly conﬁned pulse, is illustrated by the numerical examples in
2
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Figure 1(a) shows the intensity distribution
|
on the axis (x = 0) of the virtual waveguide computed for the pulse having
the two diﬀerent durations τ : 100 and 150 fs. The intensity distribution
of the continuous wave (τ =
) is shown in the ﬁgure for the comparison.
Figure 1(b) demonstrates the intensity distributions of the pulse (τ =150 fs)
at the points B, C and D. We notice that the pulse propagates in the region
of the virtual waveguide as the superposition of many pulses that diﬀract in
the oﬀ-axis direction and interfere with each other. Analysis of the intensity
distributions indicates existence of the two main stages of the evolution of
the pulse under the free-space propagation: the propagation-invariant AC
(z < Lw) and collapse CD (z > Lw) stages. In the region AC (z < Lw), the
intensity distribution of the pulse is practically unchanged that demonstrates
the propagation-invariant properties of the pulse. The pulse amplitude is
constant in the region AB and shows some oscillations in the part BC of the
region AC. The amplitude of these oscillations, which increases with increas-
ing the pulse duration, reaches maximum value before the pulse decay. In
the collapse region CD (z > Lw), the number of pulses 2M(z = Lw) + 1 is
not suﬃcient for supporting of the propagation-invariant ﬁeld distribution.
In this region, the pulse shape is not changed, but the intensity immediately
drops down to the near-zero level. The pulse decay is caused by the destruc-
tive interference between the pulses launched from the ﬁnite-width Fresnel
source of the ﬁnite-length waveguide. The distance AC = Lw strongly corre-
lates with the width (2M(z = Lw)+1)2a of the Fresnel source. This presents
a method of formation of the tightly conﬁned distortion-free fs pulses with
the step-like decreasing of intensity under the ﬁnite-length propagation in
free space. The propagation length AC could be controlled by variation of
the width of the Fresnel source. The above-described theoretical principle
of the Fresnel source can be realized experimentally by using the 2M(z) + 1
fs-pulses. In the simplest case, the source can be formed by the interference
of only two fs-pulses propagating in the oﬀ-axis direction, as shown in Fig.
2. Notice, that the two-pulse technique is similar to the method of formation

3

of the dynamical gratings (see, for example Refs. [17, 18]).

In conclusion, a method of formation of the tightly conﬁned distortion-
free fs pulses with the step-like decreasing of intensity under the ﬁnite-length
propagation in free space was described. The pulses are formed by the Fresnel
source of a high refraction-index waveguide. The length of the distortion-
free propagation and the time of the pulse decay are controlled by variation
of the width of the Fresnel-waveguide source. It should be noted that the
method can be extended to the guiding of fs pulses in free-space by the
3-dimensional virtual waveguides.
In this case, one could use the Fresnel
sources of 3-dimensional high-refraction-index waveguides [19].

Abstract

We theoretically study the problem of detecting dipole radiation in an optical system of high

numerical aperture in which the detector is sensitive to ﬁeld amplitude. In particular, we model

the phase sensitive detector as a single-mode cylindrical optical ﬁber. We ﬁnd that the maximum

in collection eﬃciency of the dipole radiation does not coincide with the optimum resolution for

the light gathering instrument. The calculated results are important for analyzing ﬁber-based con-

focal microscope performance in ﬂuorescence and spectroscopic studies of single molecules and/or

quantum dots.

The confocal microscope is a ubiquitous tool for the optical study and characterization

of single nanoscale objects. The rejection of stray light from the optical detector aﬀorded

by the confocal microscope, combined with its three-dimensional resolution, makes it an

ideal instrument for studying physical systems with weak light emission properties [1, 2].

The electromagnetic dipole is the canonical choice for modeling the radiative properties of

most physical systems. And, although the vector-ﬁeld image of an electromagnetic dipole

in a high numerical aperture confocal microscope has been known for some time [3], only

recently have the light gathering properties of the instrument been studied. Speciﬁcally,

the collection eﬃciency function for a confocal microscope based on a hard-stop aperture

was deﬁned and studied by Enderlein [4]. Such a confocal microscope is sensitive to ﬁeld

intensity and the detected optical power is obtained by integrating the component of the

dipole image ﬁeld Poynting vector that is perpendicular to the hard-stop aperture over the

aperture area.

Confocal microscopes based instead on optical ﬁber apertures have also been investigated.

The image forming properties of both coherent[5] and incoherent[6] ﬁber-based confocal mi-

croscopes, as well as the light gathering properties[7] of the microscope with a reﬂecting

object have all been examined assuming the paraxial approximation to scalar diﬀraction

theory. Since high numerical aperture ﬁber-based confocal microscopes are routinely em-

ployed in the study of silicon integrated circuits [8], single semiconductor quantum dots [9]

and other nanoscale light emitters, it is of great practical interest to understand the light

collection properties of the ﬁber-based instrument. Here, we will extend the previous stud-

ies by using the angular spectrum representation (ASR)[1, 10, 11] to study the coupling of

3

dipole radiation into a single-mode optical ﬁber [12].

For the calculation below, we assume the optical system illustrated in Fig. 1 is aplanatic.

In what follows, we refer to reference sphere 1 as the collection objective and reference sphere

2 as the focusing objective. Initially, we assume the dipole ~d is placed at the Gaussian focus

of the collection objective. The cylindrical optical ﬁber facet is assumed to be positioned

such that it is coaxial with the optical system axis (in Fig. 1) and its ﬂat face is parallel

with the focal plane of the focusing objective. We deﬁne the relevant angles and unit vectors

in Fig. 1 as follows:

ˆnφ1 =

ˆnφ3 =

sin φ1 ˆnx + cos φ1 ˆny

ˆnθ3 = cos θ1 cos φ1 ˆnx + cos θ1 sin φ1 ˆny −

where we deﬁne the spherical coordinates (θ1, φ1) ((θ3, φ3)) in the object space (image space)

sin θ1 ˆnz

ˆnθ1 =

to describe the orientation of the wavevector ~k1 (~k3), and ensure that in each section of the

optical system all coordinate systems are right-handed.

In addition, the sine condition

relates the polar angles in the object and image space as f1 sin θ1 = f3 sin θ3 where we have

introduced the focal length f1 (f3) for the collection (focusing) objective. The geometry

implies the azimuthal angles are related according to φ1 = φ3 −

π.

To calculate the vector-wave-optics image of the dipole, we employ the ASR and express

the image dipole ﬁeld as

optical system relates to ˜M as M = ˜Mn1/n3), the magnitude of the wavevectors ki =

and integrate over the polar angle θ3 and the azimuthal angle φ3 in the image space. To arrive

,

at Eq. (2), we map the vector electric far ﬁeld of the dipole across the collection objective

and then across the focusing objective according to the unit vector mappings deﬁned in

Fig. 1. We ﬁnd it convenient to integrate over the object space polar angle. Introducing

the identity dθ3 sin θ3 = (sin θ1 cos θ1/ ˜M 2 cos θ3)dθ1 into Eq. (2) and using Bessel function

identities [1] to integrate over the azimuthal angle φ3 we ﬁnd [13]

focus of the collection objective. To express the image of a displaced dipole located at

(ρo, φo, zo), we use the imaging property of the optical system and introduce ρnew = ρ3+Mρo,

ϕ3 = ϕo and znew = z3 + zoM 2(n3/n1) into Eqs. (3) - (5) where M is the optical system

magniﬁcation.

We model the case when the phase sensitive detector of the dipole ﬁeld is a single-mode

cylindrical optical ﬁber situated in the image space of the optical system. We deﬁne the

collection eﬃciency η(~ro, ~d; ˜M ) of the optical ﬁber as

where we make explicit the dependence of η(~ro, ~d; ˜M) on the dipole location ~ro and orienta-

tion ~d in the object space, and on the objective focal length ratio ˜M of the optical system

illustrated in Fig. 1 (we condense notation by introducing ~r3 = (ρ3, ϕ3, z3)). We point out

the collection eﬃciency, as deﬁned in Eq. (6), depends on the overlap of the dipole image

ﬁeld amplitude with the ﬁber mode proﬁle and not on the intensity of the dipole image

ﬁeld. For the single-mode optical ﬁber we make the weakly guiding approximation[14] and

assume the cladding refractive index, ncl, is nearly equal to the core refractive index, nco.

The utility of the weakly guiding approximation is that the propagating mode solutions

for the ﬁber, ~Ej

lm(~r3), are linearly polarized (along the direction indexed by j). For each

propagating solution, characterized by propagation constant β, there exist two orthogonal,

linearly polarized modes typically referred to as the LPlm modes. Speciﬁcally, for a ﬁber

with core radius a, the single-mode ﬁber electric ﬁeld solutions are[15]

l modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind, Z is the characteristic impedance of the ﬁber

core and the solution for the orthogonally polarized solution is obtained by interchanging x

with y in Eq. (7).

Next, we apply the previous formalism to study the collection eﬃciency of a ﬁber-based

confocal microscope. First, we position the dipole in a region of refractive index n1 =

1.33 at the focus (equal to the coordinate origin) of a NA1 = 1.2 collection objective and

calculate the collection eﬃciency η(~ro = 0; ˜M), averaged over a uniform distribution of

dipole orientations in the object space, as a function of ˜M . In addition, the single-mode

ﬁber core radius is ﬁxed to 0.5λ (λ is the wavelength of the dipole radiation) and the ﬁber

V -parameter is equal to 1.03. For the case of the two linearly polarized ﬁber modes, the

collection eﬃciency is expressible as an incoherent sum of the contribution from each ﬁber

polarization mode η = ηx + ηy (we assume the modes are linearly polarized along the x

and y directions). The result is the solid black line decorated with squares plotted in Fig.

2(a), showing that the maximum collection eﬃciency is obtained when the ratio of the two

objective focal lengths ˜M = f1/f3 = 7 (corresponding to an optical system magniﬁcation of

M = 9.31). At this focal length ratio, we calculate a coupling eﬃciency of approximately

ﬁfty-one percent. From our deﬁnition of Eq. (6), ﬁfty-one percent of the dipole radiation

8

that enters the microscope image space is coupled into the single-mode optical ﬁber.

Fixing the magniﬁcation to M = 9.31, and keeping NA1 of the collection objective equal

to 1.2, we calculate collection eﬃciency η(ρo = x, φo = 0, zo = z; ˜M = 7) when the dipole is

displaced in the object space. The results are presented in Fig. 2(b). The inset of Fig. 2(b)

displays linecuts along x (zo = 0) and z (xo = 0). We ﬁnd a full width at half maximum

(FWHM) of approximately 0.522λ along the x-direction and approximately 2.92λ along the

axis of the microscope. The product of these numbers provides us with a rough estimate of

the dipole radiation collection volume (three-dimensional optical resolution) for this ﬁber-

based confocal microscope.

In this case the number is approximately 0.795λ3. We also

studied the transverse resolution (along the x-direction) of the optical system by calculating

the FWHM as the focal length ratio was varied around the value that resulted in maximum

collection eﬃciency. The solid black line in Fig. 2(a) is the result of the calculation. We

ﬁnd that the minimum of the FWHM (the optimal resolution) does not coincide with the

maximum of collection eﬃciency. At the focal length ratio ˜M that maximizes the collection

eﬃciency the transverse resolution is approximately nine percent larger than the optimal

transverse resolution. Finally, for comparison, the solid vertical line in Fig. 2(a) is both the

collection eﬃciency and transverse resolution when ˜M = NA1/(n1NA3) where NA3 = 0.13

for the assumed single-mode ﬁber. By choosing the focal length ratio to match the refractive

index-scaled numerical aperture ratio, the ability of the resulting optical system to collect

radiation from the dipole is maximized.

In summary, for a set of ﬁxed optical system constraints, we ﬁnd that there is a particular

value of another system parameter that optimizes the overlap of the conjugated dipole image

9

ﬁeld amplitude with the ﬁber mode proﬁle and maximizes the collection eﬃciency as deﬁned

in Eq. (6). In the example here, for ﬁxed collection objective numerical aperture and single-

mode ﬁber characteristics, there is a particular value of the objective focal length ratio

˜M that maximizes the collection eﬃciency η. However, Fig. 2(a) makes clear that in

constructing a ﬁber-based confocal microscope there is a compromise between instrument

collection eﬃciency and optical resolution. It is important in system design to determine

which ﬁgure of merit, collection eﬃciency or resolution, is most important.

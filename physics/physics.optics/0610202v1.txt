We study the properties of junctions created by crossing of N identical branches of linear discrete
networks. We reveal that for N > 2 such a junction creates a topological defect and supports
two types of spatially localized modes. We analyze the wave scattering by the junction defect and
demonstrate nonzero reﬂection for any set of parameters. If the junction is nonlinear, it is possible
to achieve the maximum transmission for any frequency by tuning the intensity of the scattering
wave. In addition, near the maximum transmission the system shows the bistable behaviour.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, a variety of diﬀerent discrete network sys-
tems have been studied in order to ﬁnd the optimal ge-
ometries for enhancing both linear and nonlinear reso-
nant wave transmission [1, 2, 3], to reveal the conditions
of the prefect reﬂection and Fano resonances [4, 5, 6], as
well as to analyze the soliton propagation in the discrete
structures where the role played by the topology of the
network becomes important [7, 8, 9]. One of the major
issues of those studies is to understand an interplay and
competition of topology and nonlinearity in the dynamics
and predict new interesting phenomena.

Many of such waveguide structures can be described
as discrete linear and nonlinear networks composed of
straight, bent, and crossed waveguides in which forward
and backward propagating waves become coupled to each
other via one or more crossings (or network junctions).
The well-known systems for realizing these structures are
photonic-crystal circuits [10, 11], micro-ring resonator
structures with more than two coupled channel waveg-
uides [12], and discrete networks for routing and switch-
ing of discrete optical solitons [8]. The important ques-
tion is how the waveguide crossing aﬀects the wave prop-
agation in the network and how we can modify the junc-
tion transmission by making it nonlinear.

In this paper, we study the geometry-mediated local-
ized modes and wave scattering in the structures com-
posed of N discrete waveguides (‘branches’) crossing at
a common point (‘junction’), as shown schematically in
Figs. 1(a-d). This system can have direct applications
to the physics of two-dimensional photonic-crystal cir-
cuits [10, 11], and it describes the transmission properties
of the Y -splitters [see Fig. 1(b)], the waveguide cross-talk
eﬀects [see Fig. 1(c)], and other types of photonic-crystal
devices. We show that the intersection point of the dis-
crete waveguides acts as a complex δ-like defect even in
the absence of any site energy mismatch, i.e. when the
crossing point is identical to any of the waveguide points.
Therefore, the waveguide junction can be viewed as a
topological defect. We show that this new type of de-
fect gives rise to two stable localized modes (or defect
modes) at the intersection point, the staggered and un-
staggered ones, regardless of the amount of nonlinearity

or site energy mismatch at the junction. Next, we study
the scattering of plane waves by the crossing point, where
the incoming wave propagates along one of the branches,
and the waves are scattered to all the branches. In the
linear regime, we ﬁnd that for N > 2 the reﬂection co-
eﬃcient is always nonvanishing. This fundamental lim-
itation prevents us from achieving an ideal Y -splitter,
unless we optimize and engineer the sites near the junc-
tion [7]. For a nonlinear junction of the crossed discrete
linear waveguides, we reveal the possibility of achieving
the maximum transmission for almost any frequency of
the incoming plane wave by tuning the input intensity.
For some conditions, bistability in the transmission may
occur near the transmission maximum. To verify our an-
alytical results obtained for plane waves, we study the
propagation of a Gaussian pulse across the junction by
direct numerical simulations. The numerical results agree
nicely with our analysis.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we intro-
duce our model. Section III is devoted to the study of
the properties of a linear junction, while Sec. IV considers
the case of a nonlinear junction and discuss bistability.
Our numerical results are summarized in Sec. V, while
Sec. VI concludes the paper.

II. MODEL

We consider the system created by N identical discrete
linear waveguide (branches) crossed at a common point
(junction) which we consider to be linear or nonlinear [see
Figs. 1(a-d)]. The corresponding waveguide structure can
be described in a general form by the system of coupled
discrete nonlinear equations,

In this model, we endow the junction
(n = 0) with a linear impurity ǫ0 and a Kerr nonlinear
coeﬃcient λ. We notice that a similar discrete model
can be derived for diﬀerent types of two-dimensional
photonic-crystal devices based on the Green’s function
approach [11]. In that case, the complex ﬁeld φ(k)
n corre-
sponds to the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld.

III. LINEAR JUNCTION

First, we consider the linear regime when λ = 0, and
all equations (1) are linear. We start our analysis by
investigating the possible localized states in the system
(1).
In order to do that, we look the solutions in the
well-known form,

where A is the mode amplitude, τ is the corresponding
evolution coordinate (time in a general case, or the lon-
gitudinal propagation coordinate, for some problems of
optics), Ω is the frequency, and χ is the spatial (or tem-
poral) decay rate of a localized state. After substituting
this solution into Eq. (1), we obtain the relations for the
frequency Ω and the decay rate χ,

Ω = 2 cosh χ ,

Therefore, the junction itself constitutes an example of a
diﬀerent class of defect: a topological defect. This defect
supports two localized states whose decay rates χ± are
inversely proportional to the number of branches N .

In an inhomogeneous case when ǫ0 6

= 0, the decay rate
of the localized state can change drastically depending
on the impurity strength. For example, Eq. (4) supports
the solutions y = 1 (or χ = 0), when ǫ0 = 2
N and
2. This means that
y =
in these cases one of the localized states can disappear.
By looking at the frequency dependence of the localized
state Ω on the impurity strength ǫ0 see Fig. 2], we see that
one of the defect modes touches the band of the linear
spectrum exactly when the corresponding localized state
disappears. This happens precisely at ǫ0 =

(N

2).

Now we analyze the transmission properties of this new
type of defect. To this end, we consider an incoming
plane wave propagating in the branch k = 1 and calculate
the transmitted waves in other branches. We begin by
imposing the scattering boundary conditions for Eq. (1),

states touches the edge of the linear spectrum [see Fig. 2].
For intermediate values, 2 − N < ǫ0 < N − 2, the maximum
transmission is inside the propagation band. The shaded area

4(N
a result, the N -junction system described by the model
(1) will always reﬂect some energy back into the incoming
branch. This is a fundamental limitation which does not
allow us to build a perfect Y -splitter.

−

At this point, the following natural question arises:
What happens in the system at the maximum transmis-
sion? First, we notice that this point does not correspond
to any resonance. According to the linear scattering the-
ory all (quasi-)bound states of our system can be ob-
tained as poles of the the transmission amplitude (10).
The poles can be found in the complex plane from the

3

−

condition αq =
i, by assuming that the wave number q
is complex q = qr + iχ. Complex wave numbers corre-
spond to quasi-bound states with the complex frequency
Ω, and they can be interpreted as resonances where the
real part of the frequency gives the resonance frequency
and its imaginary part describes the lifetime (or width)
of the resonance. After some algebra, we ﬁnd that there
exist only two solutions for qr = 0, π, and for χ we have
exactly the same solutions as in Eq. (4). This means
that our system does not support any quasi-bound states
(0 < qr < π), and there exist only two real bound states
(qr = 0, π, χ

= 0).

−

What really happens is quite the opposite. Due to the
frequency dependence of the eﬀective scattering potential
ǫq, it simply disappears when the condition ǫ0 + Re(ǫq) =
0 (or αq = 0) is satisﬁed. And the system becomes al-
most transparent. The nonzero reﬂection exists due to
the nonzero imaginary part of the eﬀective scattering po-
tential Im(ǫq) = (N

2) sin q.

Equation for poles of the transmission amplitude αq =
i diﬀers from the equation for the maximum transmis-
−
sion αq = 0, and there is no relation between them. But,
in fact, there exists the condition when these two equa-
tions may produce the same results, e.g. when q = 0, π
and one of the bound state disappears. In that case we
observe the maximum transmission at the corresponding
band edge. This result can be understood in terms of
Levinson theorem, where a bound state just enters to or
emerges from the propagation band and forms a quasi-
bound state.

−

Now we can compare the dependencies of the defect-
mode frequencies Ω± = 2 cosh χ± and the transmission
coeﬃcient T on the impurity strength ǫ0 [see Fig. 3].

mission takes place at that edge. For intermediate val-

observe the maximum transmission inside the propaga-
tion band which moves towards another edge. Finally,

IV. NONLINEAR JUNCTION

Now we consider the nonlinear junction and analyze
both the localized states and wave transmission. For
λ
= 0, the junction can support nonlinear localized states
(2). The decay rates χ± can be found from the equation
similar to Eq. (4),

where we have renormalized the impurity strength, ˜ǫ0 =

calized states remain qualitatively valid in the nonlinear
regime. The only diﬀerence is that in the latter case,
there is an additional dependence on the intensity of the

2. For instance, when nonlinearity is
localized state,
A
|
|
focussing λ > 0, we have ˜ǫ0 > ǫ0. From Eq. (5) it fol-
lows that y+ decreases while y− increases. This, in turn,
implies that the corresponding modes Ω+ and Ω− be-
come narrower and broader, respectively. In the limit of
large nonlinearity, the staggered localized mode will ex-
tend all over the branches, while the unstaggered mode
will remain conﬁned to essentially one site of the junction.
Stability analysis shows, that in both cases, the localized
modes remain stable. We ﬁnd no other localized modes,
even in the strong nonlinearity regime.

Eq. (14), i.e., when αq =

a proper tuning of the intensity of the incoming wave
[Fig. 4]. Moreover, the analysis of the cubic equation

We summarize all those scenarios in Fig. 6. We notice

V. RESULTS OF NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In order to verify our theoretical results, we perform di-
rect numerical simulations of the system (1) under more

gation through the junction,

by the N = 3 nonlinear junction (a nonlinear Y -splitter), for

q0 = 2.75. These results should be compared with the results
for the plane-wave scattering shown in Fig. 4.

For our numerical simulations, we consider the case of
a nonlinear Y -junction splitter (N = 3) with ǫ0 =
1.
and λ = 1. [see Fig. 4]. Figure 7 shows our results for
the wave number q0 = 2.75 for two diﬀerent intensities of
the Gaussian pulse. In this ﬁgure, we show the temporal
pulse evolution in two branches only (k = 1 and k = 2)
since, because of symmetry, the evolution in the branches
k = 2 and k = 3 coincide.

−

because the evolution in the third branch k = 3 coin-
cides with that in the branch k = 2 due to a symmetry.
When the pulse intensity is small [see Fig. 7(a)], the
whole Gaussian pulse is reﬂected back into the incom-
ing branch k = 1, in agreement with our theoretical re-
sults [Fig. 4]. For larger values of the pulse intensity [see
Fig. 7(b)], we observe an almost optimal splitting of the

5

Gaussian pulse into the branches k = 2 and k = 3 with
the maximum transmission [see Fig. 4]. We notice that
in this case the junction φ0 remains highly excited even
after the pulse already passed through it. The excita-
tion of the nonlinear localized state at the junction is
possible because of ǫ0 =
1, one of the localized states
interact strongly with the linear spectrum band (and its
eigenvalue touches the band edge, see Fig. 2).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the linear and nonlinear transmis-
sion through a junction created by crossing of N identi-
cal branches of a network of discrete linear waveguides.
We have revealed that for N > 2 such a junction be-
haves as an eﬀective topological defect and supports two
types of spatially localized linear modes. We have stud-
ied the transmission properties of this junction defect and
demonstrated analytically that the reﬂection coeﬃcient
of the junction never vanishes, i.e. the wave scattering
is always accompanied by some reﬂection. We have con-
sidered the case when the junction defect is nonlinear,
and studied the nonlinear transmission of such a local
nonlinear defect. We have demonstrated that nonlinear-
ity allows achieving the maximum transmission for any
frequency by tuning the intensity of the incoming wave
but, in addition, the system can demonstrate bistability
near the maximum transmission. We have conﬁrmed our
analytical results by direct numerical simulations.

Abstract

We report on a theoretical and numerical investigation of the switching
of power in new hybrid models of nonlinear coherent couplers consisting of
optical slab waveguides with various orders of nonlinearity. The ﬁrst model
consists of two guides with second-order instead of the usual third-order
susceptibilities as typiﬁed by the Jensen coupler. This second-order system
is shown to have a power self-trapping transition at a critical power greater
than the third-order susceptibility coupler. Next, we consider a mixed coupler
composed of a second-order guide coupled to a third-order guide and show
that, although it does not display a rigorous self-trapping transition, for
a particular choice of parameters it does show a fairly abrupt trapping of
power at a lower power than in the third-order coupler. By coupling this
mixed nonlinear pair to a third, purely linear guide, the power trapping can
be brought to even lower levels and in this way a satisfactory switching proﬁle
can be achieved at less than one sixth the input power needed in the Jensen
coupler.

Introduction

Interest in all-optical switching devices has led to the study and design of sev-
eral promising conﬁgurations of nonlinear couplers which display intensity-
triggered power switching. The basic nonlinear coherent coupler, introduced
by Jensen [1], consists of two similar waveguides made of a material with
third-order susceptibilities, embedded in a host with purely linear suscep-
tibility. When the guides are placed parallel to each other and in close
proximity over a given distance, the guide ﬁelds overlap to some extent and
power can be transferred between the two. When all the power is initially
launched into one of the guides, the nonlinear susceptibility can give rise to
self-trapping of power in the original guide. The output power in the original
guide, for a device length equal to a coupling length, can be made to switch
from essentially zero percent at low power levels, to one hundred percent for
input power levels exceeding a characteristic threshold. In addition to the
pioneering work by Jensen, several other coupler conﬁgurations have been
considered. It was found that a three-in-a-line conﬁguration of couplers dis-
plays a more abrupt switching proﬁle, at the expense however, of greater
input power[2]. The same tendency was reported for a linear array of many
couplers[3]. In an eﬀort to improve the switching proﬁle, we introduced in a
recent work[4] the Doubly Nonlinear Trimer (DNT) coupler consisting of two
nonlinear guides coupled to a third, linear guide. Such a system displays the
interesting phenomenon of power self-trapping tunability: the critical input
power level necessary for the onset of power self-trapping can be tuned to low
values, by adjusting the value of the (linear) coupling between the nonlinear
guides and the linear one.[4],[5] In the optimal conﬁguration, switching was
achieved at one-fourth the power needed to produce switching in the Jensen
coupler. The price to pay for this improved switching is the use of larger
device lengths, up to ten times that reported by Jensen[4].

In the present work, our interest is in learning if couplers having waveg-
uides with diﬀering types of nonlinear susceptibilities would have better
switching characteristics than other standard models. We ﬁrst investigate
a diﬀerent nonlinear coupler composed of two identical guides made of opti-
cal material lacking inversion symmetry and therefore having a nonvanishing

3

second-order susceptibility. We show that this new coupler array possesses
a power self-trapping transition and an associated sharp power switching
proﬁle, albeit at a larger input power level than in Jensen’s and in our ear-
lier DNT coupler. Then, after examining a number of two-guide couplers of
mixed compositions, with each guide having purely linear (L), and second-
order (SO) or the usual third-order (TO) susceptibilities we found that for a
particular choice of parameters, a coupler composed of an SO guide and a TO
guide displays a relatively sharp power self-trapping proﬁle at an input power
level lower than previously reported, if power is initially launched in the SO
guide. Next, as in the DNT case, the onset of self-trapping can be tuned
to even lower power levels, by perturbing the two-guide coupler by adding
a purely linear control guide and adjusting the strength of the interaction
with this third guide. The resulting three-guide coupler, dubbed SO-TO-L,
resembles the DNT conﬁguration, with one of the third-order guides replaced
by a second-order guide; it displays a reasonably sharp switching proﬁle and,
as far as we know, does so at the lowest input power reported so far.

2 A new two-guide coupler

Consider a linearly coupled system of two nonlinear guides, each having the
same second-order nonlinear susceptibility. In the single mode approxima-
tion, the normalized mode amplitudes satisfy

where χ = Q(2)√P is the product of an integral Q(2) containing the second-
order nonlinear susceptibility[1] and the square root of the input power P .
The linear coupling of the guides is determined by the coeﬃcient V. With all
the power initially launched in guide 1, the initial conditions are C1(0) = 1,
C2(0) = 0. We will now show that Eqns.(1)-(2) predicts a self-trapping of
power in the original guide (guide 1). First, it is convenient to rewrite (1-2)
as a set of four equations for the complex quantities ρij ≡

Equation (7) describes a classical particle of unit mass, moving under the
inﬂuence of an external potential U(ρ), with initial condition ρ(0) = 1. Fig.1
shows the eﬀective potential U(ρ) for several diﬀerent values of χ/V . For
small nonlinearity values, the eﬀective potential is concave and conserva-
tion of energy allows complete oscillations of the “particle”; that is, power
is transferred between the two guides. As nonlinearity (input power) is in-
creased, the potential develops a local maximum whose height increases with
increasing nonlinearity. The condition for self-trapping of power in the origi-
nal guide translates here into the condition for the potential U(ρ) to develop
a double root at ρ = ρ∗ for some critical value of χ/V , i.e., U(ρ∗) = 0 and

5

(dU/dρ)ρ∗ = 0. Close examination of Eq.(8) and Fig.1 reveals U(ρ) to be
even around ρ = 1/2 and that ρ∗ = 1/2. From that, the critical value of the
nonlinearity is obtained in closed form as

Clearly, we see that for (χ/V ) < (χ/V )c, power is equally distributed between
the two guides. At (χ/V ) = (χ/V )c, an abrupt transition takes place and
power begins to self-trap in the original guide. Onset of self-trapping is a
precursor for the appearance of a sharp switching proﬁle in the transmittance

Figure 3 shows the transmittance characteristics of our two-guide second-
order (SO) coupler, and compares it with Jensen’s third-order (TO) nonlinear
coupler which is also shown in the ﬁgure, along with the TO nonlinear coupler
with three guides[2]. We note the SO nonlinear coupler array does not have
a competitive switching proﬁle compared to Jensen’s and the three-coupler
array.

3 A New Hybrid Conﬁguration

After considering the above nonlinear coupler, having second-order suscepti-
bility, we next examined a variety of mixed two-guide couplers in which each
guide was either a purely linear one, a SO or a TO guide. The objective was
to ﬁnd other two-guide couplers that displayed power self-trapping for the
initial condition where all the initial power is put into one guide. We found

that, in most cases there is no self-trapping transition at all but a continuous
power trapping. For a given mixed two-guide coupler, the trapping proﬁle
depends in a sensitive way on the order of the nonlinear susceptibility of the
guide initially receiving all power. To illustrate this point, we now describe
the most interesting case we found: The SO-TO guide system, where guide 1
possesses a second-order nonlinear susceptibility integral[1] Q(2)
1 and guide 2
possesses the usual third-order susceptibility integral[1] Q(3)
2 . The equations
for the mode amplitudes are

where χ1 = Q(2)

the TO guide (#2), the initial condition for the system, Eqns. (11)-(12),
is C1(0) = 0, C2(0) = 1. A numerical investigation of < P > reveals a
6.3 V (Fig.4). This
“delayed” self-trapping transition at χ1 = χ2 = χc ≈
value is much greater than Jensen’s and is, therefore, not useful for our
purposes. On the other hand, when all input power is put initially into the
SO guide (#1), we have the initial condition C1(0) = 1, C2(0) = 0. In this
case, a numerical search reveals that this system does not show a self-trapping
transition: the eﬀective potential U(ρ, χ1, χ2) does not develop a double root

3.0 V
found a relatively sharp power self-trapping proﬁle occurring at χ
≈
(Fig.4); i.e., a smaller power than Jensen’s critical value for self-trapping.
We then proceeded to “tune” the trapping proﬁle to even lower power levels,
by allowing the SO-TO coupler to interact linearly with a third (control)
guide possessing only linear susceptibility. The enlarged set of equations for
the mode amplitudes in this SO-TO-L coupler now reads

values, we found that W
1.1V brings the onset of self-trapping down to a
0.4 V . Note that this optimal W value is the same as found
power level χ
for the DNT coupler[4]. Now, to evaluate the transmittance of this SO-TO-L
array, we need to calculate the coupling length Lc(W ). This is obtained from
Eqns. (13)-(15) as the position z at which

comparison we also show the transmittance for the DNT coupler. Jensen’s
device switches at about χ = 4V and the side-by-side three-nonlinear guide
coupler of ref. 2 switches at about χ
4.5 V, but because of the scale of the

ﬁgure, neither of these transitions is shown. We note that the new coupler
conﬁguration SO-TO-L is capable of achieving over 99% power switching for
input power levels below χ
0.65 V which is a 48% reduction in input power
needed compared to the DNT device.

4 Discussion

In order for the above results to be meaningful, it must be true that χ2 and
χ3 can be at least approximately equal for some materials. These coeﬃ-
cients involve the usual susceptibilities χ(j) deﬁned here to give the electric

and susceptibilities. Rather than going through those calculations, we make
the simplifying assumptions that the χ(j) are constant across each guide and
that the mode ﬁeld is also constant (approximately true for the T E0 mode)
across the guide; then the integrals are easily done and we get

and power in the range 0.01 - 1 kw.

As mentioned previously, the critical length Lc for the SO coupler is the
same as for the Jensen coupler, but the SO device switches less abruptly
and at higher power than Jensen’s. The SO-TO coupler shows ﬁnal-state
asymmetry depending on which guide receives input power. If power enters
the TO leg, a self-trapping transition occurs at more than 1.5 times the
Jensen level, PJ. If the SO leg receives the power, a relatively sharp self-
trapping sets in at about 25% below PJ .

A greatly lowered power switching level is shown by SO-TO-L, but its
Lc is an order of magnitude larger than the Jensen Lc. Typical values for Lc
are about a millimeter[7] for weakly coupled devices ( i.e., the separations
between waveguides are large enough that coupled-mode theory can be used)
and less for stronger coupling. Then Lc for SO-TO-L is on the order of a
centimeter or less.

The linear interaction coeﬃcients V and W are overlap integrals, across
one waveguide, of the product of the electric mode ﬁeld of that guide and

9

the mode ﬁeld of a second guide. Therefore, V and W are functions of
the separation of the waveguides and in principle, it is possible to alter one
without changing the other; that is, the system can be tuned to achieve
minimum power switching level, by changing the distances between the linear
guide and the other two, nonlinear guides.

5 Conclusions

Our primary interest was the investigation of switching characteristics of
model nonlinear couplers having mixtures of waveguides, not necessarily with
the same orders of nonlinear susceptibilities. Earlier work on the DNT sys-
tem suggested tunability might also be used in a hybrid coupler to decrease
switching power levels. It appears possible to meet the condition χ2 ∼= χ3,
as far as known values of these quantities are concerned. Whether speciﬁc
materials can be found that meet this condition and are also compatible with
one another in a device, is another matter and one we have not addressed in
this paper .

Switching characteristics of SO is inferior to the TO system. For SO-TO,
the asymmetry of ﬁnal states with respect to input guide may be the only
aspect of its performance that could be of interest.

The most interesting coupler was the SO-TO-L, formed by adding a linear
guide to SO-TO and tuning for minimum power by adjusting the relative
positions of the guides. The transition power level drops to less than one-
sixth of PJ . Although a disadvantage of this coupler is a critical length that
is longer than for the Jensen coupler by an order of magnitude, that may be
tolerable in some applications.

Of course, there are various other conﬁgurations involving arrays of these

couplers but those were not investigated.

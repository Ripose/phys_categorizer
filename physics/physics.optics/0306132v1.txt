on an intensity parameter r.

INTRODUCTION

One-dimensional bright photorefractive solitons have
been the subject of numerous investigations by exper-
imental and theoretical physicists [1–3]. While experi-
mentalists are primarily concerned with half width mea-
surements leading to so-called “existence curves” [4],
there is also a theoretical interest in additional proper-
ties of these solitary waves, such as the form and the
asymptotic behavior of the soliton proﬁle with respect
to large distances or extreme values of its parameters.
In view of the lack of exact solutions of the relevant par-
tial diﬀerential equation there is hence a strong desire for
proper approximations that suit the needs of both groups
of physicists alike.

To our knowledge, there is only one published approach
to analytically approximating the soliton proﬁle, namely
[5]. But this approach is not the only possible one: In the
present paper we will provide alternative approximations
and discuss their respective virtues. Further we will prove
some general basic properties of photorefractive solitons
which are independent of the chosen approximation.

The starting point for our investigations is the theory
developed by Christodoulides and Carvalho [6] in which
the proﬁle f (x) of bright spatial photorefractive solitons
is described by the following dimensionless diﬀerential
equation (cf. eq.(19) in [6]):

(1)

(2)

fxx + βF (f ) = 0,

where

F (f ) = 2f

(cid:18)

Here f is proportional to the electric ﬁeld normalized to
the maximal value 1, r represents the ratio of intensity
to dark intensity of the beam and x is the coordinate
transversal to the direction of the light beam. Since the
factor β can be compensated by an appropriate scaling of
√βx, we will choose β = 1 through-
the x-axis, i. e. x
out the rest of the paper. Thus r > 0 is the only param-
eter the soliton proﬁle f (x) is depending on.

For the derivation of this nonlinear wave equation and
the pertinent simpliﬁcations we refer the reader to the
original paper [6].

Appropriate initial conditions for (1) are

f (0) = 1,

fx(0) = 0 .

(3)

Equation (1) is formally identical to a 1-dimensional
equation of motion with a “force function”
F (f ) and
can be solved analogously: One integrates (1) once and
derives an “energy conservation law”

Although the integral (6) cannot be solved in closed form,
it can be used to obtain numerical solutions of the soliton
proﬁle for any given value of r > 0. One has to be careful
because of the (integrable) singularity of the integrand at
f = 1 of the form c2
f , but most integration routines
√1
−
can deal with such singularities.

However, for some purposes it is more convenient to
work with closed formulas for f (x) or hw(r), albeit not
exact ones, than with numerical integrations. Photore-
fractive soliton proﬁles and existence curves have been
measured over a range of six orders of magnitude or r,
cf. [7–10]. Usually the experimental error margin for the
measured values of hw(r) is larger than the diﬀerence
between an analytical and a numerical approximation
of hw(r). Similar remarks apply to the soliton proﬁle.
Hence for a comparison of experimental data with the-
oretical predictions, the analytical approximation would
be equally good or even preferable, as long as it does not
become too bulky.

Another aspect of the theory of optical solitons is the
following: Although (6) cannot be solved in closed form,
it is nevertheless possible to exactly derive some charac-
teristic properties of the soliton which only depend on
the diﬀerential equation. This allows a semi-quantitative
description of the soliton amplitude f (x).
It starts at
its maximum value f (0) = 1 and decreases parabolically
with the negative curvature fxx(0) =
F (1) (parabolic
regime). Then the curvature approaches 0 and the de-
crease of f (x) is slower than parabolic. The amplitude
fw and the slope f (w)
at the point of inﬂection, i. e. where
fxx vanishes, can be exactly determined via (1) and (2).
In the neighborhood of the point of inﬂection the soliton
proﬁle is nearly linear (linear regime). For f < fw the
curvature becomes positive and the curve f (x) is bent
, the soli-
away from the x-axis. Finally, for
ton amplitude decays exponentially (exponential regime),
where the decay constant can be determined as a simple
function of r, see section II A. This semi-quantitative
discussion is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.

Section III presents exact upper and lower bounds for
the half width hw(r) which are rather close, especially
for r > 1. Section IV contains an outline of the ap-
proximation devised by Montemezzani and G¨unter [5] as
well as two new analytical approximations of f (x) and
the implied approximations of hw(r) which are of lim-
ited accuracy but relatively simple. The ﬁrst one, called
V -approximation, approximates the potential V (f ) by a
cubic polynomial in f 2 such that the integral (6) can
be done. The second one approximates the integrand
1/
of (6) by splitting oﬀ the two poles at f = 0
and f = 1 and replacing the remaining function R(f ) by
the constant R(1/2). It will be called “I-approximation”.
Both methods give reasonable approximations of hw(r)
which suﬃce for practical purposes and can be considered
as alternatives to the approximations devised in Ref. [5].
In section IV C 2 we complete the I-approximation by
a Taylor expansion of R(f ) about the center f = 1/2 and
show some examples of approximate soliton proﬁles. The
number of terms of the Taylor series which are needed to
achieve a good approximation of f (x) increases with r.
The lengthy but explicit expressions of the general Taylor
coeﬃcients can be obtained via the Fa`a di Bruno formula
and are given in the appendix.

It is obvious that our methods of approximation are
not conﬁned to the special form of the photorefractive
nonlinearity in (2) but could also be applied to other
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations or nonlinear oscillation
problems.

These partial analytical results, although being rather
elementary, are not easily found in the literature and thus
appear worth while mentioning in this article, see section
II A.

Apart from practical purposes it seems interesting that
a power series solution of (6) can be obtained which al-
lows, in principle, an arbitrarily exact calculation of soli-
ton proﬁles independent of the intrinsic errors of numer-
ical integration. However, the terms of this series are
of increasing complexity and we do not prove the series’
convergence.

Hence any solution f (x) satisfying the (symmetric) ini-

corresponding to the

IV. ANALYTICAL APPROXIMATIONS OF THE
SOLITON PROFILE

As explained in the introduction it would be desirable
to have analytical approximations of the soliton proﬁle
f (x) and half width hw(r) which are not too complex in
form and yet give qualitatively correct results for a large
range of values of r > 0. In this section we will present
the three approximations mentioned in the introduction.

A. P-approximation, cf. [5]

We will call the approximation of the soliton pro-
ﬁle f (x) due to G. Montemezzani and P. G¨unter “P-
approximation”. It will suﬃce to brieﬂy sketch it and to
refer the reader for more details to [5].

The key idea is to expand the inverse soliton proﬁle
∞n=0 a2nx2n.
1/f (x) into an even power series P (x) =
Inserting this ansatz into (1) allows the determination of
arbitrary coeﬃcients a2n by means of recursion relations.
Hence this method yields, in principle, arbitrary precise
approximations of f (x).

P

However, there are – to our opinion – some minor dis-
advantages of the P-approximation which motivate the
development of alternative approximations:

•

•

•

For concrete approximations P (x) has to be re-
placed by a polynomial of degree, say, 2n. In this
case the exponential decay of f (x) is not properly
reproduced.

The half-width hw(r) can be given by an explicit
expression only for n
4, in simple form even only
for n = 2, see [5].

≤

We do not see any possibility to extend the P-
approximation to the case of dark solitons, in con-
trast to the according claim in [5].

B. V -approximation

For large values of r, we ﬁnd

The V -approximation is an approximation of V (f ) in
the neighbourhood of f = 1 which reproduces the zeros
of V (the double zero f = 0 and the simple zero f = 1):

Introducing the abbreviation

ϕ(u)

ln(1 + u)
u

≡

(28)

the potential V can be written as

V (f ) = f 2

ϕ(r)

ϕ(rf 2)

Due to the choice of the centre f = 1 in the Taylor
approximation the soliton proﬁle is well approximated in
the neighbourhood of the maximum f = 1 for all r > 0.
In fact, plots of f (x) for diﬀerent r show a good agree-
ment of fV and f if 1
1 for arbitrary r. This can
be explained by a comparison with the r

mation f0(x) = sech(√rx) which yields the result

Hence, an approximation of the integrand rather than
the potential itself might be a good starting point for
approximating the soliton, too. Taking into account the
poles at f = 1 and f = 0 it is a natural idea to split the
integrand up into three distinct parts as

While the integrand’s behaviour at the poles is correctly
covered by the ﬁrst two summands of (39) the function
R(f ) dominates the integrand in the region between the
poles. A good approximation of the integrand can now
be achieved by expanding the function R(f ) into a Taylor
series. Due to its construction this ﬁts the exact soliton

2. Higher order I-approximations

Although for practical purposes the 0th order I-
approximation gives a suﬃciently accurate approxima-
tion of the half width, the shape of the soliton has still
room for improvement, especially for large r. The neces-
sary enhancement of the I-approximation can easily be
achieved by taking higher order Taylor coeﬃcients into
account. Fig. 7 shows that even for very large r a satis-
factory approximation can be achieved with a second or-
der I-approximation. If still higher order approximations
are needed the necessary Taylor coeﬃcients are given in
Appendix A.

APPENDIX A: TAYLOR COEFFICIENTS OF R(f )

In order to give the explicit expression of the Taylor co-
eﬃcients of the integrand I(f ) and the rest function R(f )
we write them as the composition of auxiliary functions
that can be handled much better. Let

g1(x) = ln(1 + rx2), g2(x) = x2 ln(1 + r),

g(x) = g1(x)

V. SUMMARY

In this paper we considered the proﬁle f (x) of spatial
one-dimensional bright photorefractive solitons, depend-
ing on an intensity parameter r > 0, which is only given
by means of an integral (6) but not in closed form.

We presented partial analytical results which allow a
semi-quantitative discussion of the proﬁle and studied
the closed form solutions for the limit cases r
0 and
r
. We also provided exact bounds of the half
width curve hw(r).

Moreover, we devised several analytical approxima-
tions of the soliton proﬁle and the half width which are
relatively simple in form, but in excellent agreement
with the numerical results. These approximations would
thus suﬃce for the practical purpose of comparing
experimental data with theoretical descriptions.
If an
arbitrary high accuracy of the approximation is desired
one has to resort to the Taylor series (A18). Altogether,
we thus consider the problem of evaluating the soliton
proﬁle (6) as essentially solved.

We expect that our methods can be used as a basis to
analyse more complex situations such as photorefractive
solitons under inﬂuence of diﬀusion and also be trans-
ferred to the problem of dark and grey solitons.

Although for practical purposes it is much easier to

indeed be given explicitly. Convergence issues of the re-
spective Taylor series have not been considered here.

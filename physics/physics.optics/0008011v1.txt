Abstract

The properties of pulse propagation in a nonlinear ﬁber including linear

damped term added in the usual nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is analyzed

analytically. We apply variational modiﬁed approach based on the lagrangian

that describe the dynamic of system and with a trial function we obtain a

solution which is more accuracy when compared with a pertubative solution.

As a result, the problem of pulse propagation in a ﬁber with loss can be

described in good agreement with exact results.

In recent years the propagation of optical pulses in ﬁbers has obtained a great attention

not only from the theoretical as well as from the experimental point of view. The nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE) has been employed to explain a variety of eﬀects in the prop-

agation of optical pulses. As is well known the balance between the self-phase modulation

(SPM) and group velocity dispersion (GVD) leads to the so called solitons solutions for the

NLSE [1,2]. Solitary wave solutions have been known to exist in a variety of nonlinear and

dispersive media for many years. In the context of optical communications, Hasegawa and

Tappent [3] ﬁrst made the important observation that a pulse propagating in an optical

ﬁber with Kerr-law nonlinearity can form an envelope soliton. This oﬀered the potential

for undistorted pulse transmission over very long distances. Just as a balance between

self-phase-modulation and group-velocity dispersion can lead to the formation of temporal

solitons in single-mode ﬁbers, it is also possible to have the analogous spatial soliton, where

diﬀraction and self-focusing can compensate for each other [2]. The importance of studying

optical solitons is from the fact that their have potential applications in optical transmission

and all-optical processing. A soliton is a particular solution of the nonlinear-wave equation.

Since analytical solution are known for only a few cases, investigations into the properties

solutions are normally performed numerically using such approaches. However, it is often

desirable to have an analytical model describing the dynamics of pulse propagation in a

ﬁber.

In the theoretical treatment of these problems, considerable attention has been given

to the variational approach [4,6]. A variational approach was employed in [6] deriving

information about the various parameters that characterize the beam, which are qualitatively

as well as quantitatively, in good agreement with numerical results. This result invalidates

the possibility of pulse compression without external gratings which is erroneous and is only

an artifact of the paraxial approximation.

In the same sense Anderson [7] described the

main characteristics of the temporal soliton as determined by NLSE. The discussion above

does not consider the presence of the loss in the medium.

It is well known that in real

materials, the medium will not be purely transparent and the nonlinearity will not be of

pure Kerr-law form, but will saturate. The problem of describing the physical properties of

dissipative systems has been the subject of lengthily discussions [14,15]. These results were

recently applied to the problem of propagation of cw (continuous wave) Gaussian beams in a

saturable medium with loss [13]. In that work [13] the diﬀraction is limited to one transverse

solution. After that this problem was analyzed using a variational modiﬁed approach [16].

In this paper, we will analyses the dynamics interplay between nonlinearity and disper-

sion through optical medium with loss using a variational modiﬁed approach [16]. Exact

analytical expressions for the behavior of the pulse are determined.

The starting point of our analysis is the Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation that describe

the propagation of a pulse envelope in a nonlinear loss medium,

where u(ζ, τ ) is the normalized amplitude of the pulse, ξ is the normalized coordinate, τ is

the normalized time, and Γ is the normalized loss parameter of the medium.

Now we can handle Eq.(1) adequately in the form,

and u∗ is complex conjugate of u and subindexes are the diﬀerentiation with respect to τ and

ξ . L is the lagrangian of system without loss. The Eq.(2) is the Euler-Lagrange equation

in the modiﬁed form that describe the propagation of the pulse in the medium with loss,

and can be written in the form of the modiﬁed Hamilton’s principle [15,16],

Assuming a trial functional of the form

u (ξ, τ ) = A (ξ) sech  τ

w (ξ)! exp (iφ (ξ)) ,

(4)

where A is the amplitude of the pulse propagated, w is the width and φ phase term. Using

Eq.(4) into the variational formulation, Eq.(3), we can integrate the τ dependence explicit

to obtain

where

respect to A, A∗, w and φ we obtain the following system of coupled ordinary diﬀerential

The equations above describe the characteristics of the pulse and solving these equations

we will obtain the full dynamics of the pulse through the medium. It is obvious that once

4

Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) are solved for w and |A|2, the phase φ is easily obtained from Eq.(9). In

particular, if the longitudinal phase of the amplitude A is introduced by writing A = |A| eiθ(ξ)

the Eq.(9) can be written as

from it we obtain

d

(φ + θ) =

4w2 .

φ (ξ) + θ (ξ) =

8Γw (0)2 (cid:16)1 − e−2Γξ(cid:17) .

(10)

(11)

The equation above describe the regularized phase of the pulse. This system of equation

has analytic solution. From Eq.(7) we obtain

w (ξ) |A (ξ)|2 = w (0) |A (0)|2 e−Γξ.

The compatibility of Eqs.(12) and (8) is possible when

and

|A (ξ)| = |A (0)| e−Γξ

w (ξ) = w (0) eΓξ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

where was used the relation |A (0)|2 = 1/w2 (0), with A (0) and ω (0) is the initial amplitude

and width of pulse, respectively . Now we can write the amplitude

A (ξ) = |A (0)| e−Γξeiθ(ξ).

Using the result above into the trial functional, Eq.(4), we can write the pulse in form

u (ξ, τ ) = |A (0)| e−Γξ sec h  τ

w (ξ)! exp [i (φ (ξ) + θ (ξ))] ,

(15)

(16)

where the regularized phase φ (ξ) + θ (ξ) is given by Eq.(11) and width w (ξ) by Eq.(14).

As would expect, the ﬁber loss is detrimental simply because the peak power decreases

exponentially with the ﬁber length. As a result, the pulse width of the fundamental soliton

5

also increase with propagation, as seen in the ﬁgure. However, these results are qualitatively

better than the results obtained by using the inverse scattering method where Γ is treated

as a weak pertubation. The our results foresee that the amplitude as well as the width of

the pulse suﬀer a smaller eﬀect of the ﬁber loss that thought, and approximate more of exact

numerical solution by a factor of 2 in the exponent of the exponentials [3,18,19].

In conclusion, the propagation of a pulse in a nonlinear loss medium has been analysed

using a variational modiﬁed approach. This modiﬁed approach describes in a more consistent

way the behavior of pulse in a dissipative system. The our results are more accuracy when

compared with a pertubative solution where Γ is treated as a weak pertubation.

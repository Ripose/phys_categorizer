I have re-calculated the extinction spectra of aggregates of two silver nanospheres shown in Figs. 2
and 3 of Ref. 8. I have used the approximate method of images according to Ref. 8 and an exact
numerical technique. I have found that the three sets of data (those I have obtained by the method of
images, the numerical results, and the results published in Ref. 8) do not coincide. In this Comment,
I discuss the reasons for these discrepancies and the general applicability of the method of images
to the quasi-static electromagnetic problem of two interacting nanospheres.

The method of images (MOI) is a powerful tool for
solving electrostatic problems [1].
In particular, it has
been used to calculate the electrostatic force between
two charged spheres [2].
It was shown that the force
can be well approximated by the Coulomb formula when
the spheres are far apart. However, as the spheres ap-
proach each other, they can not be eﬀectively replaced
by point charges and the Coulomb formula overestimates
the actual force. The MOI was recently extended beyond
the electrostatics [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, this gen-
eralization was subject of some controversy [9, 10].
In
particular, I have argued that the MOI, as used in the
above references, is not a physically justiﬁable approx-
imation and, therefore, can not be used for calculating
electromagnetic responses of interacting spheres at ﬁnite
frequencies [9]. I have further argued that the formulas
derived in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] do not provide accurate results
even within electrostatics, when the MOI is, in princi-
ple, applicable. The authors of Ref. [10] argued that the
MOI is an accurate approximation at suﬃciently low fre-
quencies, e.g., for f < 1GHz (this claim will be discussed
below). However, in Ref. [8], which is the subject of this
Comment, the MOI is used for the Drude dielectric func-
tion in the spectral range from 250nm to 1500nm, i.e.,
at much larger electromagnetic frequencies. I have recal-
culated the data shown in Figs. 2,3 of Ref. [8] using the
MOI as it is deﬁned in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. I have also cal-
culated the relevant quantities using the exact method
(e.g., see [11]). I have found that the three sets of data
(i.e., the data shown in Figs. 2,3 of Ref. [8], the data I’ve
obtained according the MOI using the same formulas as
in Ref. [8], and the exact results) do not coincide. The
deviations are signiﬁcant. This and other points rele-
vant to the applicability of the MOI are discussed in this
Comment.

First, we specify the dielectric function used in calcu-

lations. The expression given in Ref. [8] is

ǫ = ǫh − (ǫs − ǫh)ω2

p/[ω(ω + iγ)] ,

(1)

where ωp = 1.72 × 1016rad/sec, ǫh = 5.45, ǫs = 6.18, and
the relaxation constant γ is size-dependent:

γ = vF /ℓ + 2vF /d ,

(2)

where vF = 1.38 × 106m/sec is the Fermi velocity,
ℓ = 52nm is the electron free path and d is the sphere
diameter. All quantities give good approximation for sil-
ver. Since the electromagnetic frequency is expressed in
the units of energy in Figs. 2,3 of Ref. [8], we re-write the
expression (1) as

ǫ = ǫh +

E2
p
E(E + iΓ)

,

(3)

where E = ¯hω, Ep = 9.68eV and

Γ = 0.00181 × Ep(1 + 2ℓ/d) .

Fig. 1.

Size-dependent dielectric function for diﬀerent
values of the sphere radius d in the spectral range of interest.

The dielectric function deﬁned by these equations is
shown in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent values of the sphere diame-
ter d. It should be noted that an analogous graph is also
shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [8] for d = 10nm. While the real
part of the dielectric function is qualitatively similar in
both ﬁgures, the imaginary parts (for d = 10nm) are very
diﬀerent. By comparison with other curves in Fig. 1, I
infer that the dashed curve shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [8]
corresponds to the case d → ∞ rather than to d = 10nm,
as claimed.

The mathematical formalism of MOI [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
can be summarized as follows. The polarizability of each
sphere in a two-sphere aggregate (radius of each sphere

Fn = 4n(n + 1) sinh3 a exp[−(2n + 1)a] ,

by

(5)

where s = ǫm/(ǫ − ǫm) is the spectral parameter of the
theory, with ǫm being the dielectric function of the trans-
parent matrix in which the spheres are embedded, the
upper index L corresponds to polarization of the exter-
nal ﬁeld parallel to the axis of symmetry of two spheres
and the index T corresponds to orthogonal polarization.
The above formula is quite general and is not a subject
of controversy. The values of Fn and s(L,T )
can be, in
principle, found numerically. The potential advantage of
the theoretical developments of Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] is
that it provides approximate analytical expressions for
these quantities:

However, I have previously argued that (i) the values of
these coeﬃcients can not be, in principle, found from the
MOI, even approximately, and (ii) the above expressions
are inconsistent with the electrostatic limit [9]. There-
fore, the formulas (6)-(8) do not provide a physically
meaningful approximation. This is illustrated in Figs. 2
and 3 below.

We note that a slight change of notations has been
adopted. Thus, the factors Fn deﬁned in (6) diﬀer from
those of Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] by the overall factor of −3
and the spectral parameter s = ǫm/(ǫ − ǫm) by the factor
of −1. This corresponds to the more conventional nota-
tions [12, 13, 14]. In particular, oscillator strengths (6)
n>0 Fn = 1. Also, the expression
satisfy the sum rule
for the polarizability given in Ref. [8] contains an extra
factor of ǫm compared to Eq. (5). Although the inclu-
sion of this factor in the expression for the polarizability
is incorrect, as can be easily seen in the limit σ/d → ∞,
it does not change any of the spectral lineshapes.

P

In what follows, we consider only the results for the
polarization of the external ﬁeld being parallel to the
axis of symmetry of two spheres, since the multipole
interaction is strongest in this case.
I have used the
dielectric function deﬁned above to calculate the extinc-
tion cross-section of the bisphere aggregate for the same
sets of parameters as in Figs. 2,3 of Ref. [8]. Namely,
the dielectric constant of the matrix was ǫm = (1.61)2,
the sphere diameters were chosen to be d = 5nm (Fig. 2)
and d = 10nm (Fig. 3), and the ratio σ/d was 0.1 and

2

0.3 (Fig. 2) and 0.05, 0.15, 0.25 and 0.35 (Fig. 3). The
extinction in Ref. [8] was plotted in arbitrary units and
not deﬁned precisely. Therefore, I plot the quantity
n>0 fn/(s + sn), where E is expressed in
(E/3)Im
electron-volts. This quantity diﬀers from the actual
extinction cross section only by a constant factor,
and I have found that it has approximately the same
numerical values as the data shown in Figs. 2,3 of Ref. [8].

Fig. 2. Extinction spectra for a two-sphere aggregate
in a transparent matrix with ǫm = 1.612 and d = 5nm.
Polarization of the external ﬁeld is parallel to the axis of
symmetry. The exact result are compared to MOI and to the
spectra for isolated (non-interacting) spheres.

We ﬁrst discuss Fig. 2 which is analogous to Fig. 2
of Ref. [8], except that data for orthogonal polarization
are not shown. The exact spectra were calculated by
the method of Ref. [11] with the maximum multipole
order L = 400 and convergence was veriﬁed by doubling
this number. The MOI calculations were carried out by
truncating summation in (5) at n = 400, which is much
more than is needed for convergence. First, it should be
noted that the shape of the curves that I have obtained
by the MOI are markedly diﬀerent from those shown in
Fig. 2 of Ref. [8]. In particular, the second, low-energy
peak in

Fig. 3. Same as in Fig. 2, but for d = 10nm and a diﬀerent

selections of the ratio σ/d.

the extinction spectrum for σ/d = 0.1 is signiﬁcantly less

3

pronounced in Ref. [8] than in my data. A noticeable
deviation is also visible in the case σ/d = 0.3. A pos-
sible cause of this discrepancy is discussed below. More
importantly, the MOI curves in both cases diﬀer from
the exact result. The diﬀerence is very apparent at the
smaller separation (σ/d = 0.1), and still visible at the
relatively large separation σ/d = 0.3.

The spectra in Fig. 2 are characterized by very strong
relaxation, because the ratio 2ℓ/d is in this case of the
order of 20. Thus, the ﬁnite size contribution to the
relaxation constant is approximately 20 times larger
than the respective constant in bulk. We then consider
Fig. 3 (d = 10nm), where the relaxation is not as strong.
The results are shown in Fig. 3 which corresponds to
Fig. 3 of Ref. [8] with the exception that the results for
orthogonal polarization are not shown. Again, there
is a clearly visible diﬀerence between the MOI results
obtained here and in Ref. [8].
In all cases, the MOI
spectra are very diﬀerent from the exact spectra. This
is especially apparent at the relatively small separation
σ/d = 0.05 when the MOI predicts a spectral peak at
E ≈ 1.5Ev which is not present in the exact data. Even
for the relatively large separation σ/d = 0.35, the MOI
produces a two-peak structure, while the exact spectrum
has only one peak.
(We note here that in Fig. 3d of
Ref. [8], the respective curve has also only one peak, but
its maximum is about 10% smaller than the maximum
of the spectrum in the noninteracting case. In the exact
result, the maximum is approximately equal to that for
the non-interacting case.)

spheres of diﬀerent diameters d and the ratio σ/d = 0.35.
Polarization of the external ﬁeld is parallel to the axis of
symmetry.

The conclusion that can be made so far is that the
MOI is inadequate for the spectral range and set of pa-
rameters used in Figs. 2,3 of Ref. [8]. The inaccuracy of
the MOI is especially evident at smaller inter-sphere sep-
arations and for larger sphere diameters. We now discuss
the possible cause of the discrepancy of the MOI calcula-
tions presented here and in Ref. [8]. In Fig. 4, we plot the
MOI curve for σ/d = 0.35 and diﬀerent values of d. The
two-peak spectrum obtained at d = 10nm is the same

35

as the one shown in Fig. 3d, while the single peak spec-
trum obtained at d = 5nm closely resembles the curve
shown in Fig. 3d of Ref. [8]. Thus, the possible cause of
the discrepancy is that in Ref. [8] the actual value of the
sphere diameter used in calculations was twice smaller
than what is shown in ﬁgure captions. That is, calcu-
lations in Fig. 2 of Ref. [8] were actually performed for
d = 2.5nm and in Fig. 3 of Ref. [8] for d = 5nm. Under
these circumstances, the relaxation due to the ﬁnite size
eﬀects is extremely strong and the spectral parameter s
has a large imaginary part which eﬀectively weakens the
multipole interaction of the spheres.

We now discuss the argument given in Ref. [10] that the
MOI is accurate as long as the denominators in Eq. 5 do
not vanish and the oscillator strengths Fn’s obey the ap-
propriate sum rule. In general, this statement is correct
when |s + sn| ≫ 1 for all n. But the result obtained from
the MOI in this limit is, essentally, the non-interacting
result. Therefore, application of the MOI under these
conditions is simply not necessary. This is discussed in
more detail below.

n

First, we note that s is a complex variable while the
depolarization factors sn are all real. The exact val-
ues of sn satisfy the inequality 0 < sn < 1, while the
formulas (7),(8) can result in negative values of s(L)
if
σ/d < (21/3 − 1)2/24/3 ≈ 0.0268. It can be seen that the
smallest possible value of s(L)
that can be obtained from
n
formula (7) is −1/3. If the complex value of s is suﬃ-
ciently separated from all sn’s in the complex plane, one
can replace the denominator s − sn by s. (In the mean-
ﬁeld approximation, the denominators are replaced by
s − Q, where Q is the appropriate average of the interac-
tion operator [15].) The result is (taking into account the
sum rule for Fn’s) the polarizability of an isolated (non-
interacting) sphere. We can further expand the result in
powers of the small parameter sn/s and thus obtain cor-
rections to the non-interacting result. Unlike the former,
these corrections depend on the particular choice of Fn
and sn. An important point is that even if the corrections
are small, they are not necessarily physically meaningful.
I have previously demonstrated [9] that the corrections

4

to the non-interacting polarizability obtained with the
particular choice of Fn and sn (6)-(8) are inaccurate for
the ratio σ/d smaller than ≈ 0.3. Thus, any coincidences
between the MOI and the exact spectra, such as the ones
shown in Ref. [10], are due to the fact that the multi-
pole interaction is very weak for the particular choice of
parameters, and the obtained MOI spectra are, essen-
tially, the spectra of non-interacting spheres. But in the
spectral regions where interaction is essential, there is
an obvious discrepancy between the MOI and the exact
results [10].

We note that the complex spectral parameter s can
be removed from the section of the real axis occupied by
the factors sn, in particular, due to strong absorption.
In that case, s acquires a large imaginary part. This
was the case for the simulations shown in Figs. 2,3 of
Ref. [8]. Here the resonant interaction of the spheres was
suppressed by ﬁnite size eﬀects (2). In addition, the phys-
ical size of the spheres used in calculations appears to be
smaller by the factor of 2 than what is claimed in ﬁgure
captions. This resulted in relatively modest changes in
the spectra (compared to the spectra of non-interacting
spheres) which appear to be realistic. However, com-
parison with numerical results clearly demonstrates that
even if the very strong relaxation is taken into account,
the MOI results are qualitatively inaccurate.

Finally, it was suggested in Ref. [10] that at small elec-
tromagnetic frequencies (e.g., f < 1GHz), the real part
of the spectral parameter s is always positive, so that
the denominators s + sn can never vanish. This is clearly
incorrect for both conductors and dielectrics. In the case
of conductors, the real part of the dielectric function (1)
is negative and of large magnitude. Then the real part of
the spectral parameter ǫm/(ǫ − ǫm) is also negative and
approaches zero from the left. It should be emphasized
that in all realistic cases ǫh is of the order of unity and
can not compensate for the term −ω2
p/ω2 in the spec-
tral range f < 1GHz.
In the case of dielectrics, the
low-frequency limit of the real part of s can be either
positive or negative, depending on the sign of ǫ − ǫm.

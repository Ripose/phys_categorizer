Introduction

The study of nonlinear light propagation in periodic photonic lattices has attracted a strong in-
terest due to many possibilities of the light control offered by an interplay between the effects
of nonlinearity and periodicity. In particular, a periodic modulation of the refractive index mod-
iﬁes substantially both the linear spectrum and wave diffraction [1] and, consequently, strongly
affects the nonlinear propagation and localization of light in the form of optical solitons [2].

Recent theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated nonlinear localization of light
in the optically-induced photonic lattices where the refractive index is modulated periodically in
the transverse direction by an interference pattern of plane waves that illuminate a photorefrac-
tive crystal with a strong electro-optic anisotropy [3, 4, 5, 6]. When the lattice-forming waves
are polarized orthogonally to the c-axis of the photorefractive crystal, the periodic interference
pattern propagates in the diffraction-free linear regime, thus creating a refractive-index modu-
lation similar to that in weakly coupled waveguide array structures [7]. Such optically-induced
one-dimensional photonic lattices have been employed to demonstrate many fundamental con-
cepts of the linear and nonlinear light propagation in periodic photonic systems, including the
generation of lattice [4, 6] and spatial gap solitons in defocusing [4, 5] and self-focusing [9]
regimes, Bragg scattering and Bloch-wave steering [8], tunable negative refraction [10], etc.

In this work, we study the soliton propagation in dynamic optical lattices and identify novel
effects associated with the optically-induced refractive index modulated in the longitudinal di-
rection. Such lattices can be created by several interfering beams, which are inclined at different
angles with respect to the crystal. In particular, we consider modulated one-dimensional lattices
created by three interfering beams in a photorefractive nonlinear medium, as shown in the ex-
amples presented in Figs. 1(a-c).

wave number k1: (a) k1 = 0, (b) k1 = 0.8k2, and (c) k1 = 1.3k2. Insets show the wave vectors
of two input beams which form the lattice, and the wave vector of the third beam (red,
dashed). Parameters are A2 = 0.5, A1 = 0.33A2 and the propagation length is L = 50 mm.

We note that propagation of broad solitons in such lattices was discussed recently [11] under
the conditions when weak longitudinal modulation acts on solitons as an effective potential.
In contrast, we show that the behavior of strongly localized solitons is dramatically different,
resulting in, for example, resonant soliton explosions and revivals for the lattice of Fig. 1(a), or a

sharp binary switching transition for deep asymmetric lattice modulations [Figs. 1(b,c)]. These
results are not related to the effect of diffraction management earlier discussed in Ref. [12], and
there were not reported in any of the earlier studies of the modulated discrete systems [13, 14].

2. Binary Soliton Steering

Propagation of an optical beam in an one-dimensional optically-induced lattice can be described
by a parabolic equation for the normalized beam envelope E(x, z),

where x and z are the transverse and propagation coordinates normalized to the characteris-
tic values xs and zs, respectively, D = zsl /(4p n0x2
s ) is the beam diffraction coefﬁcient, n0
is the average refractive index of the medium, and l
is the wavelength in vacuum. The in-
duced change of the refractive index in a photorefractive crystal is [3, 4, 6, 8]: F (x, |E|2) =
−g (Ib + Ip(x, z) + |E|2)−1, where Ib is the constant dark irradiance, Ip(x) is the interference
pattern which induces modulations of the refractive index, and g
is a nonlinear coefﬁcient pro-
portional to the applied DC ﬁeld. In the numerical simulations presented below we use the
parameters which are typical for the experimental conditions with optically-induced lattices
created in photorefractive crystals [8]: l = 0.532m m, n0 = 2.35, xs = 1m m, zs = 1mm, and
g = 9.45.

Fig. 2. (1.8MB) All-optical steering of spatial optical solitons controlled by the ampli-
tude of the third lattice beam with inclination k1 = 1.15k2: (a) straight (A1 = 0.31A2) and
(b) tilted (A1 = 1.01A2) propagation. Left: proﬁles of optically-induced lattices. Middle:
evolution of beam intensities along the propagation direction. Right: soliton proﬁles at the
input (dashed) and output (solid). Animation shows the soliton dynamics as the modulation
depth increases from zero (A1 = 0) to a higher value (A1 = 1.4A2). Parameters are A2 = 0.5,
Ain = 0.5, input beam position x0 = 0 and width w = 25m m, and the propagation length is
L = 100 mm.

The lattice-writing beams polarized orthogonal to the c-axis of the crystal satisfy the
same evolution Eq. (1), but without the last term which almost vanishes since the effec-
tive electro-optic coefﬁcient is very small [3]. Then, each of the broad lattice beams prop-
agates independently, and it can be presented as a linear plane-wave solution in the form

Elattice = A exp(ib z + ikx), where k is the transverse wavenumber proportional to the inclination
angle, and the propagation constant b = −Dk2 deﬁnes the longitudinal wavevector component
kz. The value of diffraction coefﬁcient D can be controlled by varying the wavelength of lattice
beams, and also depends on the crystal anisotropy. We will analyze in detail the case when the
effective diffraction coefﬁcients for the probe and lattice beams are the same, which also allows
us to perform a comparison with the results of Ref. [11]. Speciﬁcally, we consider a lattice
induced by three interfering waves [11]: (i) two waves with equal amplitudes A2/2 and oppo-
site inclination angles, with the corresponding wavenumbers k2 and −k2, and (ii) an additional
third wave with amplitude A1 and wavenumber k1. Then, the optical lattice is deﬁned through
the wave interference pattern Ip(x) = |AL|2, where

AL = A1 exp(ib 1z + ik1x) + A2 exp(ib 2z) cos(k2x).

It follows that additional beam (with k1 6= k2) always leads to the lattice modulation both in
the transverse and longitudinal directions. We show examples of modulated lattices in Figs. 1(a-
c) corresponding to the same wave amplitudes but different inclinations of the third beam (de-
ﬁned by k1) as indicated in the insets. We see that for k1 = 0 [Fig. 1(a)] the lattice proﬁle in
the transverse cross-section becomes double-periodic corresponding to an alternating sequence
of deeper and shallower potential wells resembling a binary superlattice [15], however its con-
ﬁguration is periodically inverted due to modulations in the longitudinal direction along z. On
the other hand, when k1 ≃ k2, the lattice is slowly modulated in both spatial directions and the
left-right reﬂection symmetry is removed [11], see Figs. 1(b) and (c).

and angles of the input Gaussian beam. In (a) marked points ’a’, ’b’ correspond to the
solitons shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively. Blue markers correspond to x0 =
0.12d in (b) and k = 0.03k2 in (c), green markers correspond to x0 = −0.12d in (b) and
k = −0.03k2 in (c). Solitons in the stable regimes are plotted by triangles, in random – by
circles. Shadings mark two stable regions for input beams with x0 = 0 and k = 0, which
positions are shown with horizontal dashed lines in all the plots. Stable regions for (b)
and (c) are marked by vertical dashed lines. Parameters are the same as in Fig. 2.

First, we consider the soliton dynamics in asymmetric lattices with k1 ≃ k2, and demonstrate
the possibility of binary steering of strongly localized solitons, where the soliton propagates in
one of two allowed directions when the amplitude A1 is in one of the two stable regions. The
origin of this soliton switching effect is fundamentally different from dragging of broad solitons
reported earlier [11] which is almost directly proportional to the third beam amplitude A1.

We perform numerical modelling of Eq. (1) to study generation of a strongly localized
lattice soliton by an input Gaussian beam which is incident on the crystal at normal angle,
Ein = Ain exp (cid:8)−[(x − x0)/w]2 + ik(x − x0)(cid:9) and has extra-ordinary linear polarization. When

the amplitude of the third wave A1 is relatively small, the generated soliton starts moving be-
tween the neighboring lattice sites, as shown in the animation. As the amplitude A1 of the mod-
ulating beam increases, at certain point strongly localized soliton becomes locked at a particular
lattice site, and it propagates straight along the lattice [see Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a)], similar to
the case of homogeneous structures without longitudinal modulation [16]. We ﬁnd that this is
the ﬁrst stable propagation regime which is not sensitive to small variations of the input angle
and position [see Figs. 3(b,c)].

When the amplitude A1 grows further, the topology of the modulated optical lattice changes
due to the rotation of the high-index lattice sites, and in some interval of the modulation depth
there exists no continuous connectivity between the high-index lattice sites (see animation in
Fig. 2). In this regime the soliton propagation can become highly irregular resembling a regime
of random walks, and the soliton can even be completely destroyed by the lattice modulation.
At a certain value of A1, the rotation of the lattice sites experience saturation, the connectivity
between the sites reappear (now it is diagonal in contrast to the ﬁrst stable region where it
was vertical), and the soliton starts to move across the lattice propagating in the direction
determined by the angles of the lattice waves and independent of the value of the modulation
amplitude A1 [see Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 3(a)]. This is the second stable propagation regime not
sensitive to small variations in the input conditions [see Figs. 3(b,c)]. At very high values of the
modulation amplitude A1 the soliton do not form due to nonlinearity saturation.

angle of the modulating beam deﬁned by the ratio k1/k2. Dashed line and circles correspond
to Fig. 2(a), solid lines and triangles – to Fig. 2(b). Parameters are the same as in Fig. 2.

We can summarize that such binary soliton steering occurs due to a kind of the structural
phase transition of the optical lattice conﬁguration, where the connectivity between high-index
lattice sites changes from vertical to diagonal through a disconnected state for varying ampli-
tude of the third modulating wave, as illustrated by an animation in Fig. 2. Additionally, this
binary soliton steering is found to be insensitive to large variations of the soliton amplitude [see
Fig. 4(a)], and the tilt of the soliton increases almost linearly with the difference between an-
gles of the modulating and lattice-forming beams [see Fig. 4(b)]. Such a behavior is completely
different from the dynamics of broad solitons in weakly modulated lattices [11].

3. Soliton Explosions

Next, we analyze the soliton dynamics in symmetric modulated lattices when k1 = 0, as shown
in Fig. 1(a). According to the basic principles of holography, a beam which is incident on
the lattice at the normal angle (with k = 0) will excite resonantly the waves corresponding to
other lattice-writing beams with the transverse wavenumbers ±k2, which will then be converted
back to the original wave. Numerical simulations indeed demonstrate that the spectrum of low-

amplitude beam is modulated periodically as it spreads due to linear diffraction, see Fig. 5(a).

Fig. 5. Example of the resonant soliton explosion in the modulated lattices: (a) linear
diffraction at low power (Ain = 0.02), (b) explosion and periodic transformations of the
soliton in the nonlinear regime (Ain = 0.2). Variation of the intensity (left) and Fourier
spectrum (right) of the input Gaussian beam along the propagation direction are shown (kx
is normalized to k2/4). Parameters are A2 = 0.5, A1 = 0.1A2, x0 = 0, w = 25m m and the
total propagation length is L = 120 mm.

However, even for a weak lattice modulation, the beam dynamics is dramatically modiﬁed
at higher amplitudes, resulting in a sequence of soliton explosions and revivals, as shown in
Fig. 5(b). We identify three regimes of the soliton propagation: (i) self-focusing of the beam
which spectrum is centered around the point k = 0, (ii) transformation of the modes from k = 0
to larger spatial frequencies, (iii) the spectrum conversion back to the region around the point
k = 0, and again a periodic repetition of this three-stage process. We note that the period of
the soliton revivals does not coincide with the modulation of the lattice period underlying a
key difference with the case of the familiar diffraction-managed solitons [13]. In our case, there
exists a continuous coupling and transformation between the modes of the periodic lattice,
which is also different from the excitation of the soliton modes in the same spectral region [14].

4. Conclusions

We have demonstrated novel effects for the soliton propagation in modulated dynamic
optically-induced photonic lattices created by three interfering beams. We have shown the pos-
sibility of binary switching for strongly localized solitons where the soliton can propagate in
one of two allowed directions when the amplitude of the control beam is below or above a
threshold associated with a structural transformation of the lattice periodic potential. Each of
these regimes is stable with respect to the system parameters, in contrast to earlier consid-
ered steering of broad beams directly proportional to the control wave amplitude. We have
also demonstrated novel regimes in the soliton dynamics under the conditions of resonant wave
mixing in a conservative system observed as a series of periodic soliton explosions and revivals,
which are not associated with the effect of diffraction management.

Theory and measurement of spatial coherence of synchrotron radiation beams are brieﬂy reviewed.
Emphasis is given to simple relationships between electron beam characteristics and far ﬁeld prop-
erties of the light beam.

Introduction

Synchrotron Radiation (SR)1,2,3 has been widely used since the 80’s as a tool for many applications of UV, soft
X rays and hard X rays in condensed matter physics, chemistry and biology. The evolution of SR sources towards
higher brightness has led to the design of low-emittance electron storage rings (emittance is the product of beam size
and divergence), and the development of special source magnetic structures, as undulators. This means that more
and more photons are available on a narrow bandwidth and on a small collimated beam; in other words there is
the possibility of getting a high power in a coherent beam. In most applications, a monochromator is used, and the
temporal coherence of the light is given by the monochromator bandwidth. With smaller and smaller sources, even
without the use of collimators, the spatial coherence of the light has become appreciable, ﬁrst in the UV and soft X
ray range, and then also with hard X rays. This has made possible new or improved experiments in interferometry,
microscopy, holography, correlation spectroscopy, etc.4,5,6,7,8,9,10. In view of these recent possibilities and applications,
it is useful to review some basic concepts about spatial coherence of SR, and its measurement and applications. In
particular we show how the spatial coherence properties of the radiation in the far ﬁeld can be calculated with simple
operations from the single-electron amplitude and the electron beam angular and position spreads. The gaussian
approximation will be studied in detail for a discussion of the properties of the far ﬁeld mutual coherence and the
estimate of the coherence widths, and the comparison with the VanCittert-Zernike limit.

I. SPATIAL COHERENCE (SC)

First let us remind some concepts and deﬁne some symbols about SC of a quasi-monochromatic ﬁeld in general. If
we have paraxial propagation of a random electromagnetic ﬁeld f (p) (where p = (x, y) is a point in the transverse
plane) along a direction z, the ﬁled f (p)n at z = 0 propagates in the Fresnel approximation

and in the Far Field (FF) (Fraunhofer region), where most observations are done, we have

fz(p) =

d2p ,

˜f (k) = Fp→kf (p) =

√2π Z

θ = k

,

where we have dropped the index 0 and indicated with Fp→k the Fourier transform operator from p to k domain.

Here we use as a variable the transverse component of the wavevector k = (kx, ky), the observation angle is then

According to eq. (2), angles are expressed in terms of reciprocal space coordinates, as is natural in diﬀraction optics.
“Second-order” statistical properties of the ﬁeld are described by the “mutual intensity” (m.i.) (see11), i.e. the

ensemble average of the products of ﬁelds at two points.

It is convenient to express the m.i. as a function of the average and diﬀerence coordinates: p1 = p

M ˜f (k, ∆k) = Fp→∆kF∆p→kMf (p, ∆p) .

From this, two useful reciprocity relations connecting source and FF intensity/coherence properties can be derived12,13:

FCf (k) = IFf (k)

FIf (∆k) = CF f (∆k)

and reciprocal ones interchanging source and FF. Properties of non-stationary random functions can also be described
by the Wigner function (WF) (which is a photon number distribution in phase space, if divided by ¯hω)14,15,16 :

In fact from the deﬁnition we see that Fourier-transforming the WF with respect to k one gets the m.i. of f(x),
while transforming with respect to x gives the m.i. of ˜f (k). We also remind that the intensity at the object plane

Both Wigner and Ambiguity functions are real (almost always positive) functions and can be considered as a phase
space energy density: notice that this phase space area is dimensionless. W f propagates in the same way of the
“radiance” (or “brightness”) of geometrical optics:

A. Gaussian approximation

A gaussian model (also called a gaussian Schell model19) of a partially coherent ﬁeld has a radiance which has a
4-D gaussian distribution in phase space. From now on let us for simplicity consider one transverse dimension, say x
(and kx will be called k for short): we have then [ Wf or Af ] of the form (using our previous symbols):

the MI is then

This MI clearly satisﬁes separability between x and ∆x (Walther’s condition16). When σM ≪

σI we have the
“quasi-homogeneous” approximation (M f (x, ∆x) = If (x)µf (∆x)), and the factor function of x has the meaning of
the intensity17.

We easily see that this model satisﬁes the Schell condition (that’s why it is also called “gaussian Schell” model)

that the degree of coherence depends only on the separation between two points ∆x) : eq. 14 can be written:

In particular, we see that for a perfectly coherent gaussian beam, σM = 2σI . The Schell and Walther conditions are
satisﬁed simultaneously only for a plane wave and gaussian wave: writing the two conditions,

be 0, i.e. a Gaussian, exponential or ﬂat intensity only.

II. MUTUAL INTENSITY OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION

A characteristic of SR is that it is the random superposition of a large number of rather collimated elementary waves
emitted by each electron of the beam14,15,20. Let us call ˜a(k) the well-known far-ﬁeld amplitude (or square root of the
intensity) emitted by a single electron. It can be seen as the FT of the amplitude at the source a(p), which of course
is not a Dirac delta because of the diﬀraction corresponding to the limited angular aperture (and this is a limit to
the possibility of localizing an electron by observing or imaging the emitted SR). The electron beam is characterized
by a transverse spatial distribution g(p) and an angular distribution γ(k), which are to a good approximation both
gaussian. The ratio of the beam size and angular aperture is called the beta function and it is known from the machine
physics. Usually the source is in a place where position and angular distribution are uncorrelated; otherwise it is
possible to deﬁne an eﬀective source position at the “waist” point where the two distibutions are uncorrelated. The
“waist” points may be diﬀerent for the vertical and the horizontal distributions.

We will consider for simplicity one transverse coordinate, say x and k. The superposition of all elementary contri-
butions can be best described in phase space, where the Wigner function (or Ambiguity function) can be obtained by
a convolution of the two distributions (electron, and single-electron light)14,15.

indicated the convolution with respect to both variables. The source and FF mutual intensities are then21:

In particular, for the FF intensity:

Mf (x, ∆x) = ˜γ(∆x)[g(x)

M˜a(k, ∆k)]

I ˜f (k) = γ(k)

I˜a(k)

∗

In order to give estimates of sizes and correlation distances of SR, it is useful to use a gaussian approximation for
the SR distributions a(x) and ˜a(k). Actually they are not gaussians, but this approximation is rather good for two
reasons: g(x) and γ(k) being gaussians, the convolution is close to a gaussian, except on the tails (as a(x) has long
tails), and the part that is used is just the central one.

With this gaussian approximation, the source and FF are characterised by 6 gaussian widths.
Let us call σI the characteristic width of the intensity (so that I(x) = exp(

x2/2σ2)) at the source, and sI the FF

intensity width. The M.I. of the source is given by eq. 14

−

As we have seen (eq. 14), the degree of coherence µf (x) has a width which is related to the other two widths by:

And analogously, if we use s for the FF widths:

This is illustrated in ﬁg 1

On the other hand, if we apply the reciprocity relations (Eq. 8, 9 ) to the gaussian case, we have:

We want now to correlate these widths with the electron and SR characteristics. We approximate the single-electron

FF amplitude with

In this way we have deﬁned ρ as the gaussian width of the FF intensity. The angular width ρ is of the order of the
relativistic factor of the electrons (multiplied by 2π/λ, in our reciprocal space units)9,22,23

If we also apply to the gaussian case eqs. 19, we get

Putting together these relations, we can eventually determine the intensity and coherence properties of the FF as a
function of electron beam (and single-electron radiation) data:

In the perfectly coherent limit (se << 1/ρ and se << ρ) we have sµ =

homogeneous case is when se >> ρ and σe >> 1/ρ: in this case

∞

This result coincides with the VanCittert-Zernike theorem, valid in the limit of a completely incoherent source. In
general, however (for a rather coherent beam, that is a beam produced by an electron beam with small σe and se),
the VanCittert-Zernike theorem needs a correction21.

It may also be of interest to know the resolution for imaging the source on the basis of FF intensity and coherence
measurements. In principle, we can get both σe and se by measuring sI and sM or sµ: from the previous equations

In these remarks we have considered always a quasi-monochromatic component of the ﬁeld; in other words we
imagine the light to be ﬁltered before by a monochromator.
It may be worthwhile to mention that SR, and in
particular the radiation from undulators, is not “cross-spectrally pure” as deﬁned by Mandel24, as the spectrum
depends on angle, and then the spatial coherence and spectral characteristics cannot be separated, a subject that has
not yet been analysed in the literature.

III. EFFECTS OF QUALITY OF OPTICAL ELEMENTS.

In recent machines where spatial coherence becomes appreciable over a fraction of the photon beam width, or
in other words is very well collimated (near the diﬀraction limit), the eﬀect of imperfection of optical elements, as
mirrors25,26 or Berillium windows27 strongly inﬂuences the beam quality. For mirrors, if the rms slope error is ς, this
must be compared with θcoh = λsµ/2π: in order to have small distortions we should have ς << θcoh For windows, a
uniform illumination will become non-uniform, with a contrast

.

Some authors have called this degradation of beam quality a “reduction of coherence”27,28. Actually this is not
precise29, as the speckle-like ﬁeld produced by a random deﬂection from a rough surface (or refraction from a rough
window) is still capable of producing interference fringes in a Young experiment if the original wave was spatially

C = 2πh/λ(n

coherent. In fact, the optical path (as a function of x,y) is ﬁxed in time, it is a single realization of a random function,
in other words a deterministic function (although not known in detail). We have to distinguish averages in time from
averages over an ensemble of optical elements with similar statistical properties. The measure of correlation distance
is given by σµ or sµ, not by σM or sM , as the latter ones maybe short, for example, in a perfectly coherent light with
strong and rapid spatial variations of intensity.

In other words, coherent light stays coherent, even after passing through a random media. The photons in a coherent
volume in phase space never mix with others as a consequence of the Liouville theorem. However when we perform
a measurement, we normally measure projections (intensity) or slices (interferometry) in phase space. In the case of
a Young’s slits experiment for example, the two slits act as slices in the phase space, the beams diﬀracted from the
slits have lost directionality, and diﬀerent volumes in phase space are therefore mixed. In a intensity interferometry
experiment, we integrate the phase space distribution over the angles30.

IV. MEASUREMENTS

The ﬁrst soft x-ray interferometric measurements with synchrotron radiation were performed by Polack et al31 using
two mirrors with an angle between them of 2.25 arcmin at 60 grazing angle. Coherence measurements using Young
slits have been performed by many groups in the soft X-ray range32,33,34,35. Takayama used a young-slit experiment
to characterize the emittance of the electron beam36.

In the hard x-ray the ﬁrst interferometric measurement of the beam coherence was performed using two mirrors at

grazing incidence acting as slits37,38,39 (Fig. 3). Normal slits have also been applied40.

Other measurements of coherence have been performed by diﬀracting x-rays from a wire41,42, using Talbot eﬀect43,
a mask of coded apertures called a uniformly redundant array (URA)44. Other techniques include using nuclear
resonance from a rotating disk and measuring the spatial coherence in the time domain (the rotating disk acts as
a ’prism’ of increasing angle)45, and intensity interferometry46. The latter has been used to measure the spatial as
well as longitudinal coherence47 and characterize the 3 dimensional x-ray pulse widths. Variation of the visibility of
a speckle pattern can also be used as an indication of the coherence width48.

Abstract. Optoﬂuidic sensors based on highly dispersive two-dimensional photonic
crystal waveguides are theoretically studied. Results show that these structures are
strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the inﬁltrated liquid(nl), which is used to
tune dispersion of the photonic crystal waveguide. Waveguide mode-gap edge shifts
about 1.2 nm for δnl=0.002. The shifts can be explained well by band structure
theory combined with ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. These devices are potentially
interesting for chemical sensing applications.

1. Introduction

Optoﬂuidics, the marriage of nano-photonics and micro-ﬂuidics, refers to a class of
optical systems that integrate optical and ﬂuidic devices [1]. Due to unique properties
of ﬂuids, such integration provides a new way for dynamic manipulation of optical
properties and shows many potential applications [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. One of the
most exciting optoﬂuidic applications is to realize sensors, which can be used to detect,
manipulate and sort cells, virus and biomolecules in ﬂuidics. Many optical sensors
operate by measuring the change in refractive index at the surface of the sensor with
the method of e.g. surface-plasmon resonance, colorimetric resonances, interferometry
in porous silicon. However, these methods require large-area beams and relatively large
sensing area. Recently, Chow et al. demonstrated an ultra compact sensor employing a
two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavity [10].

Photonic crystals (PhCs) are attractive optical materials for controlling and
manipulating the ﬂow of light [11, 12, 13]. Because of the unique light-conﬁnement
mechanism provided by the photonic bandgap, they have attracted much attention
recently.
It has been shown that they have many potential applications in
optoelectronics, such as high-quality-factor ﬁlters [14], low-threshold lasers [15], optical
switches, etc. In particular, PhCs are interesting for optoﬂuidics since they naturally
have voids where ﬂuids can be injected [16, 17]. If we introduce a defect in a perfect
PhC, optical properties of the defect can be easily reconﬁgured by selectively ﬁlling
speciﬁc voids with liquid. PhC-based waveguides are highly dispersive, which has been
used to slow down the propagation velocity of light [18]. In this paper, we will propose
simple sensor structures based on highly dispersive photonic crystal waveguides. These
structures are strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the liquid which is used to tune
dispersion of the PhC waveguide. In the following we consider two diﬀerent realizations
of such a sensor.

2. Sensor structures and discussion

Let us ﬁrst consider a photonic crystal waveguide shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The
PhC studied in this paper is a two-dimensional PhC with a triangular array of air
holes in an InP/GaInAsP dielectric background. We assume that the dielectric medium
is non-absorbing, and has a constant index of refraction n=3.24. The radius of the
air holes is r=0.37a, where a is the lattice constant. We calculate the photonic band
structure by a plane-wave method [19] and the results show that the PhC possesses
a wide photonic bandgap for TE polarization (magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the air holes)
for the normalized frequency a/λ between 0.2450 and 0.3744. A simple way of making
a photonic crystal waveguide is to remove air holes within a single row. However, in
our case we need to realize a non-solid waveguide serving also as a microﬂuidic channel
or cavity. The PhC waveguide is formed by slightly lowering the radius of the air
holes in a single row and these holes are used for local refractive index modulation

by selectively ﬁlling them with liquid. Presently, the common techniques for local
index modulation are based on relatively weak nonlinearities, where δn/n is of the
order of 10−3 or lower. Other techniques are able to oﬀer much higher δn/n, such as
mechanical deformation, thermo-optics, and liquid crystal infusion. However, the eﬀects
tend to be of non-local nature. Nanoﬂuidics provides both localized control and high
refractive index modulation, which has attracted much attention. Recently, Erickson
et al. experimentally demonstrated nanoﬂuidic tuning of photonic crysal circuits [3].
Here, we will focus our study on transmission spectra of the PhC waveguide, shown in
the inset of Fig. 1(a), for the waveguide with air holes being ﬁlled with diﬀerent liquids.
Transmission spectra for the PhC waveguide are obtained using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence

time-domain (FDTD) method [20] with the boundaries treated within the framework
of perfectly matched layers [21]. The in and out-coupling of light is facilitated by
index-guiding slab waveguides with a TE-polarized fundamental mode as the source
incident into the PhC waveguide. The width of the input/output waveguide is a and
the refractive index is equivalent to that of the background of the PhC. It should be
noted that the PhC waveguide may be multimode, in which case only modes with a

symmetry corresponding to the source can be excited. Figure 1(a) shows transmission
spectra for the PhC waveguide with central air holes being ﬁlled by diﬀerent liquids
with the refractive index increasing from nl=1.0 to nl=1.5 in steps of δnl=0.1, where
the radius of the central air holes is 0.30a. The bandgap edge of the complete PhC is
indicated by two vertical dashed lines in Fig. 1(a). From Fig. 1(a), one knows that light,
with a frequency in the bandgap, can propagate down the waveguide, and that there
exists a mode-gap region in the lower frequency region, where propagation is inhibited.
Although the PhC waveguide is a lossless one, the transmission is never close to unity
due to the coupling loss at the two boundaries to the slab waveguides. Peaks in the
transmissions arise from the Fabry–Perot oscillations from the two boundaries.

For the present application we are not interested in the details of the Fabry–Perot
pattern in Fig. 1(a), but rather the spectral position of the mode-gap edge. As seen,
the low-frequency mode-gap edge does not change with the refractive index of the liquid
since it is a property of surrounding PhC. The positions for the low-frequency mode-gap
edge are in agreement with that for band-gap edge indicated by the left vertical dashed
line in Fig. 1(a). However, the high-frequency mode-gap edge is strongly dependent on
the refractive index of the liquid, as shown in Fig. 1(b) for the cases of r0=0.25a, 0.30a
and 0.35a. As an example, for the case of r0=0.30a, the mode-gap edge changes from
a/λ=0.322869 to 0.317751 when the air holes (with index nl=1) are ﬁlled by a liquid
of index nl=1.1. From Fig. 1(b), one ﬁnds that the sensitivity becomes better as the
hole size of the central increases from r0=0.25a to 0.35a. However, calculated results
show that the sensitivity does not depend much on the length of the device when the
length is larger than 7a. Now consider a commercial silicone ﬂuid with a calibrated
refractive-index accuracy of δnl=0.002, as mentioned in Ref. [10], where the refractive
index of the liquid varies from nl=1.446 to 1.454 in increments of 0.002. For the working
wavelength around 1.55µm (here we choose a=450µm), the mode-gap edge shifts up to
0.5 nm for δnl=0.002 when r0=0.30a. For comparison, we note that the shift in resonant
wavelength for the high-quality-factor (Q) PhC cavity is about 0.38 nm for δnl=0.002
with a discrepancy of 4% between the calculated and experiment results [10]. The above
results demonstrate that even such a simple PhC waveguide has potential applications as
a sensitive sensor. Shifts in the frequency can be approximately analyzed by ﬁrst-order
electromagnetic perturbation theory yielding

where D = ǫE is the displacement ﬁeld. The integral in the numerator of the ﬁlling
factor f is restricted to the region containing the ﬂuid while the other integral is over all
space. For the low-frequency gap-edge mode mentioned above, δω is nearly zero since

Xiao & Mortensen, Proposal of highly sensitive optoﬂuidic ...

f is close to zero due to the bulk slab mode. f is about 20% for the high-frequency
gap-edge mode when nl=1.446. Thus, the problem is really that of maximizing the
ﬁlling factor.

To further understand the physics behind it, we next support the picture by
dispersion calculation for the PhC waveguide. For this purpose we use a plane-wave
method [19]. The dispersion of the PhC waveguide in absence or presence of a ﬂuid
is shown in Fig. 2, which clearly illustrates how a waveguide mode forms within the
bandgap region. Figure 2 (a)-(f) summarize the dispersions for the PhC waveguide,
where the air holes, of radius 0.3a, are ﬁlled by a liquid with a varying refractive index.
The shaded regions are the projected band structure for TE slab modes, while the dots
and circles represent the odd and even waveguide modes, respectively. The existence of
a waveguide-mode gap is indicated by two horizontal dashed lines, where the mode-gap
edges are in agreement with those obtained from the transmission spectra in Fig. 1(a).
When increasing the refractive index of the liquid [going from panel (a) toward panel
(f)], the high-frequency mode-gap edge (blue-dashed line) is signiﬁcantly downward
shifted. However, the low-frequency mode-gap edge, related to the band-gap edge,
does not change as the refractive index of the liquid increases. We emphasize that all
results obtained from band structures are consistent with those from the transmission
spectra. The sensitivity of this structure is mainly attributed to the dispersion of the
even waveguide mode denoted by circles in Fig. 2.

and odd waveguide mode, respectively.

Let us next consider another photonic crystal waveguide shown in the inset of

Fig. 3(a), where the waveguide is introduced by removing the background medium
leaving us with an air channel waveguide. The width of the air channel waveguide is
denoted by w, while other parameters and the input/output waveguide are totally same
as those mentioned above. Transmission spectra, for the ﬁlled liquid with ﬁve diﬀerent
indices from nl=1.0 to nl=1.4 in increments of δnl=0.1, are shown in Fig. 3(a) when
w=0.6a. The band-gap region is also indicated by two vertical dashed lines. Similar
to the result for the structure shown in Fig. 1(a), the waveguide mode-gap region still
exists. The high-frequency mode-gap edge slightly changes as the refractive index of
the liquid increases, while the low-frequency mode-gap edge is strongly dependant on
the liquid. The low-frequency mode-gap edge is downward shifted as the refractive of
the liquid increases. Here, we are only interested with the change of the position for
the slow-frequency mode-gap edge, as shown in Fig. 3(b). One ﬁnds that the slope
for the sensitivity hardly change when varying the width of the channel waveguide.
Compared with the results for the high-frequency mode-gap edge shown in Fig. 1(b),
from Fig. 3(b) one can ﬁnd that such a waveguide shows a better sensitivity. From
Fig. 3(b) one also ﬁnd that sensitivity does not change much when varying the width of
the channel waveguide from w=0.4a to 0.6a. The mode-gap edge shifts δ(a/λ)=0.0085
when the air holes are ﬁlled by a liquid of index nl=1.1 for the case of w=0.6a. For
comparison we have δ(a/λ) = 0.0051 for the structure shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a)
when r0=0.30a. The ﬁlling factor of the low-frequency gap-edge mode is about 44%,
which is higher than that of the high-frequency gap-edge mode for the ﬁrst structure
shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Results from the numerical calculations are consistent with
those obtained from the perturbation theory, Eq.(1). Again we consider a commercial
silicone ﬂuid with a calibrated refractive-index accuracy of δnl=0.002. For the working
wavelength around 1.55 µm (a=450 nm), the mode-gap edge shifts up to 1.0 nm for
δnl=0.002. The proposed sensor relies strongly on the dispersion of the PhC waveguide
mode and the presence of a mode gap. To further improve the sensitivity, we optimize
the PhC waveguide structure by varying the radius (r1) of the ﬁrst row of air holes
surrounding the channel waveguide. For simplicity we ﬁx the width of the channel
waveguide to 0.6 a. We note that the device only works when the mode-gap exists and
that the mode-gap will disappear as r1 increases. By a careful design of the structure
shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a), we have been able to improve the design further. For
the working wavelength around 1.55 µm (a=450 nm), the mode-gap edge shifts about
1.2 nm for δnl = 0.002, when r1 is tuned to 0.45 a. Besides, this device has only a
size about 5 µm × 5 µm, which is suﬃciently compact for most applications. However,
from Eq.(1), one knows that the sensitivity is proportional to the ﬁlling factor f for a
speciﬁc working wavelength. Since the ﬁlling factor may be close to unity, photonic
crystal devices may potentially have a sensitivity close to the limit.

3. Summary

In this paper, we have theoretically studied optoﬂuidic sensors based on highly dispersive
two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides. Our study shows that these structures are
strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the liquid, which is used to tune dispersion
of photonic crystal waveguides. For the working wavelength around 1.55µm, waveguide
mode-gap edge shifts up to 1.2 nm in increments of δnl = 0.002. Compared with the
air-holes waveguide, the channel waveguide in the PhC shows a better sensitivity, which
can be explained by the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. Our study shown above is
based on two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides, while, it can be easily extended
to a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab. Even though it may be diﬃcult to inject
liquid into the waveguides, we would like to emphasize that recently Erickson et al.
experimentally demonstrated nanoﬂuidic tuning in a similar structure [3]. These devices
show a potential for chemical sensing applications.

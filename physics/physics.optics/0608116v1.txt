Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to analyse the physical-chemical surface proper-
ties of subwavlength structured silver ﬁlms and ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) numerical
simulations of the optical response of these structures to plane-wave excitation, we report on the
origin and nature of the persistent surface waves generated by a single slit-groove motif and recently
measured [1] by far-ﬁeld optical interferometry. The surface analysis shows that the silver ﬁlms
are free of detectable oxide or sulﬁde contaminants, and the numerical simulations show very good
agreement with the results previously reported.

INTRODUCTION

The optical response of subwavelength-structured metallic ﬁlms has enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the past few
years due to the quest for an all-optical solution to the inexorable drive for ever-smaller, denser integrated devices
operating at ever-higher band width [2]. Two basic questions motivate research in this ﬁeld: how to conﬁne micron-
sized light waves to subwavelength dimensions [3] and how to transmit this light without unacceptable loss over at
least tens of microns [4, 5]. Although surface waves and in particular periodic arrays of surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs) have received a great deal of attention as promising vehicles for subwavelength light conﬁnement and transport,
detailed understanding of their generation and early time evolution (within the ﬁrst few optical cycles) in and on real
metal ﬁlms is still not complete [6, 7, 8, 9]. Recent measurements [1, 10] of far-ﬁeld interference fringes arising from
surface wave generation in single slit-groove structures on silver ﬁlms have characterized the amplitude, wavelength
and phase of the surface waves. After a rapid amplitude decrease within the ﬁrst three microns from the generating
groove, waves persisting with near-constant amplitude over tens of microns were observed. Such long-range transport
is the signature of a ”guided mode” SPP, but the measured wavelength was found to be markedly shorter than the
expectation from conventional theory [11]. One possible reason advanced for the disparity between experiment and
theory was the presence of an oxide or sulﬁde dielectric layer on the silver surface, and it has been suggested [12] that
an 11 nm layer of silver sulﬁde would bring experiment and theory into agreement. We report here the results of two
investigations: one experimental, into the physical-chemical surface properties of the silver structures with the intent
of detecting the presence of a dielectric layer and the other theoretical, into the calculated optical response of the
untarnished silver slit-groove structures using the FDTD technique to numerically solve Maxwell’s equations. These
studies shown no evidence of oxide or sulﬁde layers on the silver surface and the numerical solutions to Maxwell’s
equations show good agreement with measurements reported in [1].

fused silica substrate A, silver layer B, capping gold layer C, and capping platinum layer D. The darkened features in the Ag
layer (B) are dislocations and grain boundaries.

II. TEM ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURED SILVER SURFACES

Three typical structured samples were chosen for examination with fabrication dates of about 12 months, 6 months,
and 1 week from the date of the TEM analysis. The structures dating from 6 months and 12 months were part of the
series of structures actually used in the previous reports [1, 10]. The subwavelength structures consist of a 400 nm
silver ﬁlm evaporated onto a fused silica substrate (Corning 7980 UV grade c(cid:13) 25 mm square, 1 mm thick optically
polished on both sides to a roughness of no more than 0.7 nm). The structured substrates are stored in Fluorowarer
sample holders, 25 mm diameter and 1 mm in depth at the center.

A. Methods

Electron transparent sections for cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination were pre-
pared by sample thinning to electron transparency using standard focused Ga+-ion beam (FIB) milling procedures
[13] in a FEI 200 FIB workstation and placed on a holey carbon support. The TEM characterization was performed
using a Philips CM300 Schottky ﬁeld emission gun (FEGTEM) microscope operating at 300 kV. The ﬁeld emission
electron source is ideal for applications requiring high coherency, high brightness at high magniﬁcation, or small fo-
cused probes of selected areas. The FEGTEM has a point resolution of 0.2 nm and an information limit of 0.12 nm.
The minimum focused electron beam probe size is 0.3 nm. In dark ﬁeld images, one or more diﬀracted beams are
allowed to pass the objective aperture while the direct straight-through beam is blocked by the aperture. In contrast
to the direct beam, the diﬀracted beam interacts strongly with the specimen and selection of a particular diﬀracted
beam allows better visual phase diﬀerentiation.

B. Examination of silver (Ag) layers

Typical regions of Ag layer that were thinned to electron transparency are shown at relatively low magniﬁcation in
the bright ﬁeld micrograph in Fig. 1. An immediate distinction can be made between the fused silica substrate (A)
and the Ag deposit (B). Protective capping layers of Au and Pt, applied at the time of analysis, are marked at (C)
and (D) respectively. The latter are used to prevent any ‘top down’ ion damage of the cross-section during the ion
beam thinning preparation.

The white colored line marked by an arrow in Fig. 1 and shown in more detail in Fig. 2 is a band that contains very

ﬁne particles of Au that are formed during the initial stages of the deposition of this metal.

3

FIG. 3: A higher magniﬁcation of the upper sur-
face showing the Au particle-containing protec-
tion layer. The undulations and voids indicate
a surface nonuniformity somewhat greater than
that of the samples in general (± ∼ 10 nm from
400 nm nominal thickness) but the site was chosen
to more vividly show the initial line of gold capping
nanoparticles.

FIG. 2: Cross-sectional bright-ﬁeld through-focal
TEM micrograph of the Ag layer (B) on the fused
silica substrate (A). The protective capping layers
of Au and Pt are marked at (C) and (D) respec-
tively.

FIG. 4: Cross-sectional bright-ﬁeld through-focal TEM micrographs of the Ag layer on the fused silica substrate. The images
were acquired at over-focus (left), in-focus (middle) and under-focus (right).

The ﬁne particles do not exhibit the same degree of absorption contrast as the bulk of the Au formed above them
because the particle diameters are less than the thickness of the cross-sectional slice and thus do not extend through
the full thickness of the TEM sample, as do the relatively coarse grains constituting the bulk of the Au protection
layer. A higher magniﬁcation TEM micrograph of this region is shown for clarity in Fig. 3. It is clearly observed
that the Au nanoparticles form a separate layer above the Ag deposit and any local undulations in the Ag layer are
observed to be devoid of any oxide or sulﬁde layer.

Fresnel contrast methods were used to examine the upper surface regions of the silver in more detail and a typical

between the two materials, always results in Fresnel fringes. Because the amplitude and phase changes that occur
when an electron is scattered elastically are characteristic of the atomic number, there will be changes in the elastic
scattering directly related to the form of the projected scattering potential when there is a composition change at an
interface viewed in projection [15], analogous to a phase grating ﬁltering of the scattered electronic wave function.
Interface Fresnel eﬀects can thus provide a signature on the form and magnitude of any compositional discontinuity
that is present. The visibility of these fringes depends on the thickness of the specimen and on the defocus value of
the microscope. The contrast of the fringes is higher with increasing defocus, at both positive and negative values

from the minimum contrast condition. From Fig. 4, the critical observation is in the absence of Fresnel eﬀects at the
surface of the metal as a function of focus conditions other than at the localized regions associated with the gold
protective coating. The lack of Fresnel fringes at the upper surface indicates a lack of variation in the scattering
potentials and hence of the chemistry or the composition at the interface. The lack of Fresnel signature demonstrates
that silver surface is not covered by a detectable layer of sulﬁde or oxide since their presence would exhibit diﬀerences
in scattering potential by comparison with the metal itself [14]. The lower detection limit for such compositional
diﬀerences is a few tenths nanometer layer thickness.

C. Discussion of the surface analysis

The high resolution TEM analysis failed to detect the presence of oxide or sulﬁde coating on any of the structured
silver samples. This result is in fact not surprising and is consistent with a simple estimate of the surface chemical
impurity likely to be present. Since the structures are kept in air-tight sample holders, the total,static volume of air
to which they are exposed during storage is ≃ 2000 mm3. The trace fractional concentrations of sulfur dioxide and
hydrogen sulﬁde in ordinary laboratory air is less than 0.2 × 10−9 [16] and therefore about 1010 impurity molecules are
available to react with the 625 mm2 silver surface. The average linear distance between impurity molecules, assuming
all of them reacted with the surface, is therefore about 250 nm – a surface density below the detection limit of the
FEGTEM instrument.

For comparison, TEM was also conducted on a similar Ag structure left fully exposed to ambient laboratory
environment for more than two years. The resulting micrograph and electron diﬀraction pattern are shown in Fig. 5.
The tarnished Ag layer is observed to be uniform and the corresponding electron diﬀraction data shows a fully
amorphous (noncrystalline) character evidenced by the broad diﬀuse rings. The detection of a relatively high intensity
signal from a nominally nondiﬀracting material yields valuable information on not only the crystallinity of the material,
but also the chemical composition. Comparing the electron diﬀraction data for the tarnished samples to that for the
silver structures described earlier, we ﬁnd no evidence of a similar noncrystalline material on the surface of the
untarnished Ag shown in Fig. 1.

III. CALCULATION OF THE FAR-FIELD TRANSMISSION

The optical response of structured metal surfaces is simulated using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence-time-domain (FDTD) ap-
proach [17]. The subwavelength slit-groove structures [1, 10] can be modelled in two dimensions, and we consider here
the case of transverse magnetic TM polarization (with the H-ﬁeld transverse to the plane of incidence and parallel to
the long axis of the slit-groove structures). The set-up for the simulations is shown in Fig. 6. The Maxwell equations

where Ex, Ey, and Hz are the Cartesian components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, Jx and Jy are the Cartesian
components of the current density ~J, ε is the electric permittivity and µ0 is the magnetic permeability of free space.
In metallic regions of space ε is a complex valued, frequency-dependent function. Within the standard Drude model
[18] it is given as,

where ε0 is the electric permittivity of free space, ε∞ = ε (ω → ∞) is the dimensionless inﬁnite frequency limit of the
dielectric constant, ωp is the bulk plasmon frequency, and Γ is the damping rate. In order to properly describe the
material dispersion of the metal structures we numerically ﬁt the real and imaginary parts of the Drude dielectric
constant in the form of Eq. 2 to the experimental data collected in [19]. The Drude parameters obtained in the
wavelength regime ranging from 750 nm to 900 nm for silver are ε∞ = 3.2938, ωp = 1.3552 × 1016 rad s−1, and
Γ = 1.9944 × 1014 rad s−1, which correspond to Re [ε] = −33.9767 and Im [ε] = 3.3621 at λ0 = 852 nm. These ﬁtted
parameters are close to those determined in [1] by ellipsometry, Re [ε] = −33.27 and Im [ε] = 1.31. Numerical results
were not sensitive to this range of parameter variability.

The frequency dependence of the dielectric constant Eq. 2 results in an additional equation to the Maxwell equa-

tions (1), describing the time evolution of the current density ~J in the metallic region of space [20].

As a reference for the optical response of the Drude metal we also implement perfect electric conductor (PEC)
boundary conditions, where the metal dielectric constant is set to negative inﬁnity, and all electromagnetic ﬁeld
components are therefore strictly zero in metal regions.

The light source is a plane wave, incident perpendicular to the metal surface and depending on time as,

Einc (t) = E0f (t) cos ωt,

(4)

where E0 is the peak amplitude of the pulse, f (t) = sin2 (πt/τ ) is the pulse envelope, and τ is the pulse duration
(f (t > τ ) = 0.

Time propagation of Eqs. 1, 3 is performed by a leapfrogging technique [17]. In order to prevent nonphysical reﬂection
of outgoing waves from the grid boundaries, we employ perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundaries, within
which Hz is split into two additive subcomponents [22]. In order to avoid accumulation of spurious electric charges
at the ends of the excitation line and generate a pure plane wave with a well-deﬁned incident wavelength, we embed
the ends in the PML regions. We have tested this approach by direct comparison with the total ﬁeld/scattered ﬁeld
technique [17]. In all simulations the spatial grid ranges from x = −16.2 µm to 16.2 µm and y = −1.79 µm to 1.79 µm.
Convergence is achieved with a spatial step size of δx = δy . 4 nm and a temporal step size of δt = δx/ (2c), where c
denotes the speed of light in vacuum.

All simulations have been performed on distributed memory parallel computers at the National Energy Research
Scientiﬁc Computing Center and San Diego Supercomputer Center. The parallel technique used in our simulations is
described in detail in [23].

Calculations of the intensity, I ∼

a line parallel to the metal surface and located at the distance LD. The collected data is averaged over time and the
spatial coordinates for a range of slit-groove distances. Finally, the space- and time-averaged intensity is normalized
to unit maximum. Our results converge with LD & 1 µm and are invariant to the pulse duration (hence converged to
the CW limit) with incident pulse durations τ & 120 fs. A direct comparison of the experimental data with both the
PEC and the Drude models is shown in Fig. 7.

Clearly, the Drude model agrees very well with the data, whereas the PEC model predicts oscillations of the intensity
with a noticeably larger wavelength and smaller amplitude. In order to properly deﬁne the wavelength of oscillations
we use a damped sin function to ﬁt the data shown in Fig. 7 and extend both the FDTD simulation and the ﬁtting
function to a slit-groove distance of 16 µm, well beyond the range of experimental data. We then take the Fourier

distribution, corresponding to the eﬀective wavelength, λeﬀ , at which surface waves propagate. The PEC model gives
λeﬀ = 852.8993 nm, whereas the Drude model results in λeﬀ = 835.0934 nm. The eﬀective surface index of refraction

where λinc is the incident wavelength (in the experiment λinc = 852 nm), leads to the following values: neﬀ (PEC) =

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Surface analysis by transmission electron microscopy of subwavelength structured silver ﬁlms used to investigate
their optical response [1, 10] showed no detectable evidence of material on the surface other than silver. The suggestion
that an 11 nm sulﬁde layer may be present so as to bring the interference pattern calculated by the authors of Ref. [12]
into agreement with experiment is therefore not conﬁrmed.

In contrast to the calculations reported by Ref. [12], numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations reported here using
an FDTD approach does show very good agreement with the fringe amplitude and wavelength over the slit-groove
range of the data reported in [1]. Extrapolation of the FDTD simulations beyond the range of the measurements
shows a smoothly decreasing amplitude behavior whereas the calculations of [12], tend to a constant amplitude with
constant fringe contrast. This latter behavior is the signature of an SPP guided mode. Although the FDTD results
reported here do not exhibit this behavior, analysis of the results reveal that the most probable wavelength in the
Fourier distribution is 835 nm, within a few nanometers of the SPP wavelength of 839 nm. The reasons for the
discrepancies between the results of Ref. [12], which employ a diﬀerent approach using rigorous-coupled-wave-analysis
(RCWA) and those reported here have not yet been identiﬁed.

Previous studies of lasers and nonlinear resonators have revealed that the polarisation degree

of freedom allows for the formation of polarisation patterns and novel localized structures, such

as vectorial defects. Type II optical parametric oscillators are characterised by the fact that the

down-converted beams are emitted in orthogonal polarisations. In this paper we show the results of

the study of pattern and defect formation and dynamics in a Type II degenerate optical parametric

oscillator for which the pump ﬁeld is not resonated in the cavity. We ﬁnd that traveling waves

are the predominant solutions and that the defects are vectorial dislocations which appear at the

boundaries of the regions where traveling waves of diﬀerent phase or wave-vector orientation are

formed. A dislocation is deﬁned by two topological charges, one associated with the phase and

another with the wave-vector orientation. We also show how to stabilize a single defect in a realistic

experimental situation. The eﬀects of phase mismatch of nonlinear interaction are ﬁnally considered.

Most studies of pattern [1–3] and localized structure [4–17] formation in optical systems consider light with a ﬁxed

linear polarisation. However, the vectorial degree of freedom of light, associated with a space- and time-dependent

polarisation, leads to a very interesting phenomenology, as previously shown for Kerr cavities [18–20], sodium vapors

[21], lasers [22–24] and intra-cavity second harmonic generation [25]. This degree of freedom is also relevant from

the point of view of information encoding and processing, because it yields a tool for the control of these structures.

Optical vortices have been predicted to occur in optical systems such as lasers [26] and they have been experimentally

observed in lasers [27] and photo-refractive resonators [12,28,29]. More recent theoretical studies revealed the existence

of vectorial defects in optical systems [24].

Among optical systems, optical parametric oscillators (OPO’s) have been the object of intense theoretical study

in recent years, which has revealed the existence of patterns [30–41] and localized structures [10,13,14,17,42–45]; few

examples of defect dynamics have also been published [17,38,46]. Finally, experimental results on transverse pattern

formation have been recently presented [47,48]. An OPO consists of a ring (or Fabry-Perot) resonator containing a

nonlinear quadratic medium, which performs a parametric down-conversion of an injected laser beam (optical pump)

at frequency ωp. Two new ﬁelds are generated in the crystal, the signal and the idler, at frequencies ωs, ωi respectively,

such that ωp = ωs + ωi, the last relation indicating the conservation of photon energy. The nonlinear interaction also

requires photon momentum to be conserved, i.e. the phase-matching condition kp −
obtained by exploiting polarized beams and crystal birefringence. This eﬀect often implies that a transverse walk-oﬀ

ki = 0, which is usually

ks −

between the diﬀerent polarisation components may occur. The consequences of walk-oﬀ have also been considered

and convective instabilities and noise-sustained patterns found [39,40,45,49,50]. Most of these theoretical studies have

been performed in the context of a scalar approximation, which is valid for the so called Type I OPO’s; in the Type

I interaction the signal and idler ﬁelds have the same polarisation, orthogonal to the pump beam. However, there

are not many studies involving Type II OPO’s where the polarisation degree of freedom is taken into account. In

refs. [31,34,35,38] the model equations can be valid for an OPO that is non degenerate either in polarisation or in

frequency; however the intrinsic physical diﬀerence between the two cases was not made evident. In refs. [46] and [51]

the polarisation non-degenerate case and the polarisation and frequency non-degenerate case have been considered

and the role of the walk-oﬀ explored. Finally the case of polarisation coupling, due to cavity birefringence and/or

dichroism has been analysed for the case of an OPO, showing Bloch walls formation [52]; these structures were later

found also for second harmonic generation [53].

In this paper we will focus our attention on the polarisation pattern and vectorial defect formation in a Type II,

frequency degenerate OPO. In particular we will consider the case in which the pump is not resonated in the cavity and

can be eliminated from the dynamics by means of a multiple scale approximation. This simpliﬁcation has also been

made in order to take into account the eﬀects of phase mismatch, which has been only partly studied in connection

2

with Type I OPO’s [33]. In fact, the conservation of the photon momentum need not to be exact for down conversion

to occur, the conversion eﬃciency being lower if kp −

ki 6
The paper is organized as follows. In section II we present the equations which model the Type II OPO and some

exact, stable solutions, which are combinations of traveling waves (TW’s). Due to the vectorial nature of the ﬁeld these

solutions represent spatial polarisation patterns. We also show that these TW’s are spontaneously formed starting

from a random perturbation of the trivial steady-state, that is represented by the ﬁeld below the threshold of signal

and idler generation. In section III we show that, on a background made of TW’s, vectorial defects are spontaneously

generated. The defects are classiﬁed as vectorial dislocations by comparing the quantities characteristic of a dislocation

of a complex ﬁeld with those of the defects obtained in the dynamical system. The dynamics of defects is also studied

in this section. The stabilization of a single defect is then presented in section IV. The discussion of the eﬀects

due to the presence of the phase mismatch is given in section V and the conclusions presented in section VI.

In

Appendix I we derive the basic equations in which our study is based, and in Appendix II we derive the corresponding

amplitude equation (a Swift-Hohenberg equation) for the instability leading to frequency-converted light generation

in our model.

II. EQUATIONS AND BACKGROUND SOLUTIONS

We considered a model for a Type II OPO, for which the pump is not resonated in the cavity and in which some

mismatch among the interacting waves is allowed. Previous studies of pattern formation, except ref. [33], neglected

mismatch; however real devices are likely to present a residual mismatch due to the selection mechanism of the signal

and idler frequencies (see [54] for details). Since the Type II conﬁguration means that the signal and the idler are

orthogonally polarized ﬁelds we will use the notation Ax, Ay to denote them. The starting point is the slowly varying

envelope approximation propagation equations for a Type II interaction which include the mismatch (see for example

[55]). By following the procedure outlined in Appendix I, we obtain the evolution equations for the cavity ﬁelds:

∂tAx = γx[

where γx, γy are the decay rates of the signal and idler in the cavity, ∆ the cavity detuning, ax, ay the diﬀraction

coeﬃcients. Note that the detunings of the two ﬁelds are made equal to a common value ∆ [56] by choosing the

temporal reference frame such that stationary homogeneous states do not have free rotating phases. The other terms

which appear in these coupled equations are respectively:

At perfect phase-matching µ = E0, σ =

1 ; otherwise the coeﬃcients are complex numbers; their real, imaginary

parts are shown in ﬁg. 1 for E0 = 1.5. Similar coeﬃcients were also found for a Type I, singly resonant frequency

degenerate OPO, by Longhi in ref. [33], with the same type of analysis. Note that the lasing of an OPO requires

∆k
|

|

< π/L because the parametric gain outside this range is too small and the device tends to ”jump” to another pair

of signal-idler frequencies which satisfy this condition [54]. Finally note that all coeﬃcients can become dimensionless

as soon as appropriate time, space and ﬁeld amplitude scaling are performed.

Equations (1,2) have exact traveling wave solutions of the same type as those found in ref. [35]:

This quantity can be zero if the diﬀraction coeﬃcients are equal for the signal and the idler. Hereafter we will

consider only the case of frequency degenerate OPO, i.e. when the frequency of the signal and idler are the same; this

also implies that γx ≃

in the cavity, as suggested in Appendix I. Strictly speaking if ω = 0 the solutions (5) are not traveling waves but

rather standing phase waves; however, we will generally refer to them as TW. It is important to note that considering

the case ω = 0 is not restrictive in the sense that all features observed for this case survive also for ω

= 0, at least

when a uniform pump and periodic boundary conditions are used. We checked this by integrating eqs. (1,2) also for

= ay; the main diﬀerence is that phase waves travel. Under the hypothesis made in this paragraph the eﬀective

2 = 1. Note that if no mismatch

is present the solutions also satisfy α = 0 and therefore Ax = A∗

y. Hereafter we will consider only the case of perfect

phase-matching and leave the observations about the eﬀects of mismatch to section V.

A physical interpretation of the exact solutions can be given in terms of spatial polarisation patterns. In fact, under

the assumptions made, the Stokes parameters [58]

These equations mean that the coupled-TW solution (Ax, Ay) represents an elliptically polarized ﬁeld with a two-

valued spatially periodic azimuth (θ = tan−1(S2/S1)/2) and with a spatially periodic ellipticity parameter η(r) =

Other stable solutions can be found as combinations of the basic TW solutions (5) as shown in ref. [34] for a triply

resonant, non-degenerate OPO. They can be generally written as:

The coeﬃcients fk determine the kind of solution; for example the TW is (f1, f2, f3, f4) = (√C, 0, 0, 0) and the

standing rolls are (√C, 0, √C, 0). An interesting solution for this case is that of the alternating rolls (f1, f2, f3, f4) =

that gives rise to a square intensity pattern. We found that this structure is stable with periodic boundary conditions,

but it deforms and disappears as soon as other, more realistic, boundary conditions are applied. We show in ﬁg. 4

the square array with periodic boundary conditions after an evolution of t = 500 time units; no appreciable change

of the initial condition (12) has been observed.

The equations also have a trivial steady-state solution Ax = Ay = 0, that represents the non lasing state of the OPO

and whose stability analysis is similar to that performed in refs. [30,31,35]. Brieﬂy, Ax = Ay = 0 becomes unstable

for

|

> 1 if ∆ < 0 and for µ > √1 + ∆2 if ∆ > 0. For ∆ > 0 the trivial solution becomes unstable for homogeneous

perturbations (kc = 0) and no pattern or structure is expected to be spontaneously formed. In numerical simulation

we observed the transition to a ﬁnal, stable, homogeneous state of intensity C, preceded by a transient regime where

domain walls form but soon disappear [17]. For ∆ < 0 the most unstable modes are TW with a critical wave-vector

kc

∆/a, i.e. such that the equivalent detuning ˜∆ is zero. Note that the most unstable modes are also exact

TW solutions of eqs. (1,2). Although stability of such TW’s was not studied, numerical solutions give evidence that

they are stable and moreover that they are spontaneously formed starting from a random perturbation of the trivial

steady-state when the pump amplitude is above the threshold of the parametric interaction. Then, the spontaneously

selected TW’s have wave-vector modulus

of space; this causes the occurrence of defects in the patterns as will be shown below. Hereafter we will treat only the

case of polarization pattern formation, i.e. ∆ < 0.

If the pump amplitude is weakly above the threshold (5%) two diﬀerent ﬁnal situations can be found starting from

a random perturbation of the trivial steady-state under periodic boundary conditions. In the ﬁrst, all defects initially

formed tend to annihilate each other and the ﬁnal state is a single TW of random orientation, whose wave-vector is

exactly kc. As in the case of non-degenerate OPO’s [35] no intensity patterns appear but only phase stripe patterns,

which correspond to the polarisation patterns described by eqs. (5) and (10). In another case, for the same pump

6

amplitude but with other initial random conditions, ordered structures of defects may form as shown in ﬁg. 5. By

looking at the real and imaginary parts of the ﬁeld Ax it is clear that these defects are found along the fronts which

separate regions where TW’s with the same wave-vector but with diﬀerent phase have been selected. From the ﬁgure

it is also clear that these defects appear on a background of TW solutions, at those points where the stripes do not

match.

Defects also appear spontaneously with pump amplitudes well above threshold (50%); in this case the positions

of the defects are not ordered, as shown for example in ﬁg. 6 a) and b). Defects always appear in both orthogonal

polarisation components (i.e. the signal and the idler simultaneously) and therefore they can be classiﬁed as vectorial,

since the two components of the vector ﬁeld (Ax, Ay) are zero at the same point in space. In ﬁg. 6 c) and d) the

phase of the polarisation components is also presented; note that it is not deﬁned at the points where the amplitude

goes to zero. Then, such objects require a topological classiﬁcation that is furnished in the next section. Finally note

that setting ax 6
phase waves, which now travel as previously described. This has been cheked by running the same simulation (i.e.

= γy does not alter the basic features observed; defects persist and are advected by the

= ay or γx 6

that of ﬁg. 5) with and without equal coeﬃcients.

It is always useful to have in mind the general characteristics of the instability of the zero state in our OPO

model, in order to relate it to other pattern forming systems.

In our case, the instability for ∆ < 0 is at a non

vanishing wavenumber kc, so that a Swift-Hohenberg equation for the complex envelope of the unstable modes is the

appropriate amplitude-equation description close to threshold. For the case ax = ay, this Swift-Hohenberg equation

has real coeﬃcients. This equation is derived from our basic equations (1,2) in Appendix II.

III. DEFECT CLASSIFICATION, FORMATION AND DYNAMICS

In this section we analyse the formation and dynamics of defects, in Type II OPO’s. The existence of defects in

a Type I non-degenerate triply resonant OPO was pointed out in ref. [38] where the dynamics of an advected defect

pair was also reported. Here, we present a detailed study of the defects which spontaneously appear in the Type II

frequency degenerate OPO. The analysis includes: a) the classiﬁcation of the defect type, showing that these defects

are dislocations of the TW pattern; b) the formation process under several diﬀerent conditions and regimes and c)

the trapping and stabilization of a single defect.

A dislocation of a scalar complex ﬁeld A(r, θ), (r, θ) being spatial polar coordinates, can be deﬁned as a conﬁguration

which can be deformed continuously (in a neibourhood of a point r0, which is then identiﬁed as the core of the

7

dislocation and it is taken as the origin of the polar coordinates) into the following function:

A(r, θ) = R(r) exp(i(θ + kr cosθ)) = R(r) exp(iφ)

(13)

The function R(r) is real and depends on the radial coordinate such that R(0) = 0. This condition is necessary

because the phase φ of the ﬁeld is not deﬁned in the origin of coordinates. In ﬁg. 7 a) we show the real part of A from

which we can observe that the defect is found at the point where the stripes of the background, whose wave-vector

far from the defect is k, do not match. The phase φ is shown in ﬁg. 7 b); the defect is centered at the point r0 = 0,

around which the phase changes by 2π. The topological charge associated with the phase change is deﬁned by the

integral of the phase gradient on a closed contour surrounding the point r0

Note that there exists also another dislocation obtained by setting θ

θ for which the topological charge n0 is

→ −

equal to

1. However the most interesting feature of a dislocation is that it is characterised by another topological

−

charge. This is associated with the function

where the indices x, y of the term on the right hand side refer to the vector components. This function, which

deﬁnes the orientation angle of the wave-vector k, is shown in ﬁg. 7 c) for the ﬁeld A deﬁned by eq. (13). Note

that there are two points where ψ is not deﬁned: one is located at the point r0, corresponding to the point of zero

amplitude; the second is at another point r1 where

= k−1. Then, the topological charges associated with ψ

r1
|

r0

|

−

are:

where the integration contour surrounds the point r0 but leaves outside the point r1 and

where the integration contour surrounds the point r1 but leaves outside the point r0. Note that there is not a zero

in the amplitude R at the point r1.

We now turn our attention back to the Type II OPO and compare the defects which are found in the numerical

solutions of eqs. (1,2) with the dislocation just deﬁned. In this section, to better compare numerical and theoretical

results only periodic boundary conditions and homogeneous pump beams are considered; more realistic conditions

will be explored in section (IV) when stabilization of a dislocation is considered.

The randomly generated defects of ﬁgures 5 and 6 are dislocations on a background of TW’s, although in the

second case it is diﬃcult to recognize the background solutions since the defects are dense in the integration window.

However a ﬁngerprint of TW is found also for the data of ﬁg. 6 by observing the far ﬁeld in ﬁg. 8. There, a ring of

modes of radius kc is clearly observable, a clear indication that the background is made mostly of TW solutions of

diﬀerent orientation but the same wave-number kc. The dislocations can be also clearly identiﬁed when the quantities

ψx and ψy (deﬁned again through eq. (15) where the phases are those of Ax, Ay) are calculated for the same data of

ﬁg. 6. The result is presented in ﬁgures 9 a) and b) where a contour plot of

taken at a low intensity level

,
Ax|
|

Ay|
|

to indicate the locations of the zeros of the ﬁeld, is superimposed on the grey-scale coded images of the functions ψx

and ψy. From ﬁg. 9 we note that in this static condition “chains” of defects of the functions ψx,y are formed. Two

zeros of the amplitude (defects of charges n0, m0) are in fact connected by the relative pair of defects of the functions

ψx,y at the second point (defects of charge m1). This stems from the fact that the phase diﬀerence between Ax and

Ay is zero (when there is no mismatch) and thus Ax = A∗
y.

Regarding the dynamics [59] of the spontaneously generated defects, we observe that they appear at the early stage

of the process. Some of them are annihilated within a few thousand cavity lifetime units. After this stage we cannot

observe any annihilation, up to 100000 cavity lifetime units. The initial number of dislocations and their positions

change with diﬀerent initial conditions. The statistical distribution of the ﬁnal number of defects, by changing initial

conditions, is shown in ﬁg. 10; observe that a Gaussian ﬁt is actually very good. We note that the defect density

never reaches that of the square pattern (eq. (12)) with critical wave-vector kc. After the initial formation stage, we

observe in our runs that defects have a slow, random motion. This regime is mostly dominated by the attraction of

pairs of defects of opposite charges n0 =

1. For longer times the motion tends to stop and an equilibrium condition

±

is reached. Although no detailed statistical study has been conducted we also note, by inspection of ﬁg. 9, that there

seems to exist a characteristic length of separation between the defects, which is an indication that an equilibrium is

likely to be reached.

To better study defect interaction we use (13) as an initial condition and integrate eqs. (1,2). Due to the periodic

boundary conditions a pair of defects is generated, as shown in ﬁg. 11 a). These correspond to two dislocations in the

real part of each ﬁeld (ﬁg. 11 b)), two phase singularities with opposite topological charge (ﬁg. 11 c)) and two pairs

of defects associated with the quantity ψx (ﬁg. 11 d)). At the initial stage the zeros of the amplitude, which have

9

opposite n0 charge, attract each other; later, when the ψx defects (which have the same charge m0 = 1) get closer,

this attraction is stopped and an equilibrium position is found [59]. This paired structure is stable at least up to the

time explored by numerical solutions.

In general, the detailed behavior of defects dynamics is governed both by local, phase curvature eﬀects and by

defect-defect interactions. The range of these interactions depends on the parameters of the system, which determine

the spatial extent of the defect. For example if we make the detuning more negative (e.g. ∆x = ∆y =

1 and

−

ax = ay = 1) two defects displaced parallel to the background wavefronts either annihilate, if close enough, or repel

each other, if further away.

Figure 12 also shows a pair of defects (same parameter values as in Figure 11 but diﬀerent initial displacement)

undergoing motion; the background has a wave-vector of 2kc and it is stable when the system is pumped far above

threshold. When their separation is small enough, the defects brieﬂy rotate around each other before continuing their

transverse motion. As a consequence of this motion and the periodic boundary conditions, the defects collide and

annihilate shortly afterwards (not shown).

Figure 13 shows another interesting example. Two defects approach each other while the background phase wave

undergoes a zig-zag instability [60]. When they meet they form a bound pair which follows the local curvature of the

background phase fronts, changing direction as the slow phase dynamics alters this curvature. The bound defect pair

is stable for the duration of the simulation (115000 cavity lifetimes). It also exists for lower pump powers, down to at

least ﬁve percent above threshold. On the other hand, at slightly higher pump powers than that used in Figure 13,

the structure destabilises: after a short time the defect pair rotates slightly before annihilating.

The previous examples show that long–lived defect interactions are important features of the dynamics of Type

II OPO’s. This fact is in agreement with instances of long term survival of many defects generated by random

initial conditions (e.g. Fig. 6) and is clearly diﬀerent from vortex dynamics observed, for example, in complex

Ginzburg-Landau models [61].

Close to threshold, it is possible to study the behavior of the Type II OPO dislocations by means of amplitude

equations. These are derived in Appendix II where comparisons are made with simulations of the full model.

IV. TRAPPING OF ISOLATED DISLOCATIONS

We know that periodic boundary conditions always require the total topological charge within the domain to be

zero. In this section, we take into account that the pump amplitude E0 actually has a spatial dependence and periodic

10

boundary conditions are not applicable. If a spatial Gaussian or super-Gaussian distribution is used for the parametric

gain factor µ (eq. (3)), the spontaneously generated defects often tend to move to the region where the ﬁeld is zero.

The trapping of single defects necessary for their experimental observation as single entities is then an interesting

issue.

We tried, successfully, to isolate a single defect in a more realistic pump beam, by using, as an initial condition for

one of the ﬁelds, a doughnut mode. This idea follows the experimental results of induced dislocation formation in

quadratic nonlinear interactions [62]. Note that no cavity was used in those experiments and the defect was maintained

by forcing a doughnut mode in the ﬁeld at the crystal input. Here the dislocation is ”written” at the beginning but,

after that, no injection is required since the cavity provides the necessary feedback to sustain the structure. The

resulting, stable trapped defect is shown in ﬁg. 14. The spiral wave in the phase ﬁeld spins when ax 6
it is stationary after the initial formation stage. Note that in order to trap the defect the beam size must be kept

= ay, otherwise

smaller than the wavelength of the most unstable TW λc = 2π/kc otherwise more defects are induced or the initial

defect is dragged outside the beam. The creation of other defects is due to the tendency of the system to generate

pairs. If the system size is comparable with the critical wavelength, the paired defect will appear inside the pumping

region and will destabilize the original defect. If the size is smaller the second defect will be generated outside the

pumping region and therefore will not inﬂuence the dynamics of the trapped defect (ﬁg 14 c)). The amplitude proﬁles

of the ﬁelds of this single defect are shown in ﬁg. 15.

This way of generating the defects is also useful for understanding the mechanism of their formation. The presence

of a defect in one ﬁeld, say Ax, induces a defect of opposite charge n0 in the other because of the parametric coupling.

0 at t = 0 the term which dominates the dynamics of Ay in the initial regime is the largest linear one,

x. Hence, Ay is forced by the complex conjugate of Ax and a defect of opposite charge is formed. Eventually the

other terms of eqs. (1,2) become signiﬁcant: the real part of the cubic term provides the saturation which stabilizes

In fact if Ax ≃
i.e. µA∗

the solution and nonlinear phase modulations appear if mismatch is present, due to its imaginary part.

If we initialise a defect with topological charge n0 =

2 using the technique described above, we observe that it

breaks up into two defects of charge n0 =

1.

±

Since the generation of such defects has been seeded externally, the question arises whether it is possible to obtain

defects for positive detunings. In spite of the absence of stable traveling–wave solutions, single vortices can be trapped

by using the same seeding technique.

We also observe that walk-oﬀ removes all structures from the pumping region and a single TW is selected asymp-

totically. However, it is interesting to note that in the transient regime dislocations are formed. They appear at the

front which divides two regions where stripes with diﬀerent wave-vector modulus are selected. The diﬀerence in the

wave-vectors is due to the walk-oﬀ, as shown in ref. [46].

Finally, we estimate the threshold for the observation of this isolated dislocation in an OPO. Considering data

for KT iOP O4 [63]: χ = 7.33 pm/V, n0 = 1.8 at λ0 = 1.064µm, and by using the deﬁnition of the eﬀective cou-

pling paramater deﬁned in Appendix I (α) and considering a nonlinear crystal length of 1cm, a mirror transmit-

tivity 10−2, the input ﬁeld at threshold (E=1) can be evaluated as EIN,0 ≃

mittivity constants). The super-Gaussian beam used in the simulation has a beam diameter of about 10 normalized

units; a spatial normalized unit corresponds, for the diﬀraction coeﬃcient of the simulation to about 0.195mm; hence

the CW threshold power is about 0.95W . The physical cavity decay rates γx,y are about 0.17GHz while the cavity

detuning is 34M Hz. All these data are compatible with an experimental realization.

V. MISMATCH EFFECTS

This section is dedicated to the study of the eﬀects of mismatch (∆k

= 0) between the ﬁelds in the OPO. As

previously noted, in real devices it is often possible that the selection rules of the oscillation frequencies force the

OPO to emit radiation with a slight mismatch [54].

The eﬀects of the mismatch, predicted by the analysis of section II, are the following: a) an increase in the threshold

for signal generation (i.e. the instability, see eq. (3)); b) a spatial shift of the iso-polarisation lines for the exact TW

solutions. The latter eﬀect is due to the appearance of the phase shift α

= 0 (see eq. (5)) between polarisation

components; this stems from the imaginary parts of the coeﬃcients µ and σ, the contribution of the latter being a

nonlinear phase modulation due to the χ(2) : χ(2) cascading eﬀect [64].

For the case of the spontaneous generation of defects we have been able to determine that the phase shift α is

non zero in the regions where the background solution dominates. The numerically found value is very close to the

value predicted by eq. (7). However, approaching the zeros of the amplitude the phase diﬀerence also tends to zero

although the phase of the ﬁelds is not strictly deﬁned at the defects. In practice the zeros of the spatial function

α(x, y) are located exactly at the positions of the ﬁeld defects. This behavior can be explained as follows: close to

the defects the cubic terms tend to zero; in particular the term proportional to the imaginary part of σ (i.e. the

Kerr-like phase modulation term) is the ﬁrst that can be neglected. Although µ =

exp(iβ) is complex, by an

appropriate re-deﬁnition of the variables as ˜Aj = Ajexp(iβ/2) j = 1, 2 we can obtain a set of equations for ˜Aj where

the parametric gain is purely real (µ′′ = 0). Thus, we reduce the problem to the case where no mismatch is present

(see eq. (7)) and therefore α

0.

→

The ﬁnal number of spontaneously generated dislocations seems also to be aﬀected by the phase mismatch. We

note that this number decreases by changing the mismatch from negative to positive values, keeping all the other

parameters ﬁxed. In particular it seems that positive values of the mismatch encourage the annihilation of the pairs

of dislocations. This has been veriﬁed by numerical integrations with the same parameters and initial conditions as

ﬁg. 11 but with non zero mismatch. For ∆k > 0 we observed that the pair is annihilated, while for ∆k < 0 the

pair reaches a stable conﬁguration. A possible cause of this asymmetry is the phase modulation α introduced by the

mismatch, which changes sign according to the sign of the mismatch (see ﬁg. 2).

The eﬀect of phase mismatch on the trapped defect is to destabilise it, by generating asymmetries in the ﬁelds for

both positive and negative values of ∆k.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion we have studied the polarisation pattern and vectorial defect formation in a Type II frequency

degenerate optical parametric oscillator.

We found that the preferred solutions, those that are selected out of an initial perturbation of the zero state, are

conjugate traveling waves in the two components of the polarisation. A spatial polarisation pattern is then formed:

the state of polarisation changes along the spatial coordinate parallel to the selected wave-vector kc with period equal

to λc/2 = π/kc.

In particular the state of polarisation changes along the meridian of the Poincare sphere which

passes through the linearly polarized states of azimuth θ =

π/4 if ∆k = 0. The magnitude of the wave-vector of

±

the selected solution is ﬁxed by the parameters and has a single random orientation close to threshold and multiple

random orientations far from threshold. Combinations of traveling waves, that form square patterns are also stable

solutions and, close to the threshold of the instability, ordered arrays of defects can form spontaneously.

Such defects are isolated zeros of the two linear components of the polarisation, i.e. they are vectorial defects.

They are dislocations which form in spatial positions where the background solutions (traveling waves) do not match

spatially. Two diﬀerent kinds of topological charge must be deﬁned: one kind of charge is associated with the phase

and two charges with the director angle of the ﬁeld wave-vector. The ﬁrst charge, located at the point where the

amplitude goes to zero, can be

1 and is always opposite in the two polarisation components. The charge associated

±

13

with the wave-vector is always +1 at the point where the amplitude is zero and

1 at the paired point, where the

−

amplitude is not zero. The polarisation components are totally correlated; in fact all defects, both in the phase and

wave-vector ﬁelds, have a corresponding defect in the other polarisation component. In this way the defects form

chains in which the separation among defects seems to have a typical size, which is of the order of the background

wavelength.

The trapping of an isolated defect has also been demonstrated. This is accomplished by keeping the size of the

pump beam smaller than the critical wavelength of the preferred traveling wave such that a second defect cannot be

created inside the pump beam but rather lies outside and does not inﬂuence the dynamics.

Finally, we have addressed the eﬀects which may arise when the nonlinear interaction is slightly phase mismatched,

i.e. the increase in the threshold of signal generation, and the linear and nonlinear phase shifts among the polarisations,

the latter due to the cascading eﬀect. Numerical results showed that a positive mismatch can favor the annihilation

of dislocations.

Possible applications of defects can be foreseen in the ﬁeld of particle and atom trapping [65].

case (∆k = 0) in order to focus on the form of the diﬀraction coeﬃcients of the ﬁnal equations. The phase matching

condition implies that once the three frequencies and two refractive indices are given, then the third refractive index

is determined. For example for n0 we have

These equations clearly show that the loss and diﬀraction coeﬃcients depend critically on the refractive indices even

Since our analysis starts from stationary homogeneous solutions, the choice of the temporal reference frame is ﬁxed

by the condition ∆x = ∆y = ∆ which excludes phase rotations for the stationary homogeneous states [56]. In this

We note that it is still possible to have equal loss and diﬀraction coeﬃcients for the three waves if we consider

cavities of diﬀerent lengths

Li for each ﬁeld. This can be achieved by inserting compensating prisms of chosen length
Λi and refractive indices Ni. In this case the equations are the same as (28) but with redeﬁned loss and diﬀraction

By adjusting losses σi and compensating prism coeﬃcients, one can select equal γi. In this way the compensating

which leaves a lot of ﬂexibility for the ﬁnal setting.

Finally, we observe that in the absence of a cavity for the pump ﬁeld there are just two equations for the signal

and idler waves remaining. By setting A0 = E

determine the appropriate amplitude-equation description for the instability. Related derivations have been presented

in [36,37]. For simplicity, consider the case

The important point is that there is a single order parameter (F1) governed by a Swift-Hohenberg equation (SHE)

[60] and a second ﬁeld (F2) which is slaved to F1. In other words, the dynamics of the system is described by a

single complex scalar ﬁeld. Note that it is only when Ax = A∗

y that the order parameter becomes real [38]. An extra

imaginary transverse Laplacian term appears in (52) when ax 6

= ay.

(31)

(32)

(34)

(35)

Despite the assumptions underlying its derivation (Equations (33)), the SHE can sometimes oﬀer a good description

of the system even outside its expected range of validity. For example when integrating eq. (34) with the same

parameter values as in Figure 11, the ﬁnal state is essentially the same stable defect pair. Nonetheless, notable

failures of the SHE can be found; for example in reproducing the movement of the bound defect pair in Figure 13.

This indicates that the original dynamics is not well reproduced when the assumptions leading to (33,34) are violated,

and serves as a warning about the limitations of order parameter equations such as (34).

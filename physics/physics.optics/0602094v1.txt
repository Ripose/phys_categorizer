Investigations of the optical response of subwavelength structure arrays milled into thin metal
ﬁlms has revealed surprising phenomena including reports of unexpectedly high transmission of light.
Many studies have interpreted the optical coupling to the surface in terms of the resonant excitation
of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), but other approaches involving composite diﬀraction of surface
evanescent waves (CDEW) have also been proposed. We present here a series of measurements on
very simple one-dimensional (1-D) subwavelength structures with the aim of testing key properties
of the surface waves and comparing them to the CDEW and SPP models.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Initial reports of dramatically enhanced transmission through arrays of subwavelength holes in thin ﬁlms and
membranes [1–3] have focused attention on the physics underlying this surprising optical response. Since the early
experiments were carried out on metal ﬁlms, surface plasmon polaritons [4, 5] were invoked to explain the anomalously
high transmission and to suggest new types of photonic devices [5]. Other interpretations based on “dynamical
diﬀraction” in periodic slit and hole arrays [6, 7] or various kinds of resonant cavity modes in 1-D slits and slit arrays [8,
9] have also been proposed. Reassessment of the earlier data by new numerical studies [10] and new measurements [11]
have prompted a sharp downward revision of the enhanced transmission factor from ≃ 1000 to ≃ 10 and have
motivated the development of a new model of surface wave excitation termed the composite diﬀracted evanescent
wave (CDEW) model [11]. This model builds a composite surface wave from the large distribution of diﬀracted
evanescent modes (the inhomogeneous modes of the “angular spectrum representation” of wave ﬁelds [12]) generated
by a subwavelength feature such as a hole, slit, or groove when subjected to an external source of propagating wave
excitation. The CDEW model predicts three speciﬁc surface wave properties. First, the surface wave is a composite
or “wave packet” of modes each evanescent in the direction normal to the surface. The surface wave packet exhibits
well-deﬁned nodal positions spaced by a characteristic wavelength, λsurf ; second, the appearance of the ﬁrst node at
a distance of λsurf /2 from the subwavelength launch site (essentially a phase delay of π/2 with respect to the E-ﬁeld
of the external driving source); and third, an amplitude decreasing inversely with distance from the launch site. We
present here the results of a series of experiments on very simple 1-D subwavelength surface structures designed to
investigate these predictions and thus assess the validity of the model.

II. SUMMARY OF THE CDEW MODEL

The essential elements of the CDEW model can best be summarised with reference to Fig. 1.

It is based on a
solution to the 2-D Helmholtz equation in the near ﬁeld and subject to the slab-like boundary conditions of a slit in
an opaque screen. The basic expression describing the scalar wave is

with ∇2 = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂z2, k = 2π/λ and E(x, z) the amplitude of the wave propagating in the x, z directions.
Kowarz [13] has written down the solution to this equation for the case of an incident plane wave propagating in air

polarised parallel to the plane of the structure and perpendicular to the slit of subwavelength width d. A fraction of the
incoming light Esurf forms the composite diﬀracted wave in the ±x directions, and the blue trace (displaced above the surface
for clarity) shows Esurf . The alternating blue and red loops indicate the ﬁeld lines induced by the CDEW near the surface of
the silver ﬁlm. The green trace (oﬀset above the blue trace for clarity) shows the cosine representation of the CDEW expressed
by Eq. 4 and closely approximating Eq. 2a for |x| ≥ 3/4 λ. The wavelength λsurf = λ0/nsurf where nsurf is the surface index of

practical experiment, any real planar structure has two surfaces: an “input side” in the half-space z < 0, containing
the incoming plane wave, and an “output side” in the half-space z ≥ 0, containing the far-ﬁeld propagating modes
issuing from the output surface and a photodetector. Experiments can be carried out by fabricating subwavelength
grooves on the input side, the output side or both. The measurements reported here concern only the input-side
experiments (Fig. 2). Results for output-side experiments will be reported later.

III. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS

Measurements of the optical response of the slit-groove and hole-groove structures were carried out using a home-
built goniometer shown in Fig. 3, details of which are described in the caption of Fig. 3 and in the Methods section.
We have carried out a series of measurements on simple 1-D structures to test the “signature” predictions of the
CDEW model, viz. (1) a composite surface wave expressed by Eq. 5 and approximately represented by a damped

the slit and the groove is 100 nm, the height 20µm and
the groove depth ∼ 100 nm. The distance Np is the
pitch increment p = 104 nm multiplied by the number of
increments N.

FIG. 5: SEM image of one of the series of single-groove,

the groove-hole structures is 260 nm thick, the width and

and the diameter of the hole is 300 nm. The distance

wave, Eq. 4; (2) a phase shift of π/2 between the CDEW and the driving source plane wave and (3) a wave amplitude
that decreases inversely with distance from the launching groove. Figures 4, 5 show one of the series of structures
consisting of one slit and one groove and one hole and one groove, respectively. The slit-groove distance xsg or
hole-groove distance xhg is indicated as Np where p is the basic unit of distance increment, the “pitch,” and N is the
number of increments. The pitch p was taken to be 104 nm, approximately one-eighth the wavelength of the surface
wave and N was varied from 4 to 59. Structural details of these devices are described in the captions of Figs. 4, 5
and in the Methods section. The slit(hole)-groove structures were mounted facing the input side and exposed to
plane-wave radiation from the focused TEM00 laser source. Measurements of light intensity on the output side in the
far ﬁeld, 200 mm from the plane of the structures, were carried out on the slit-groove structures using the goniometer
setup described in the Methods section. The results are shown in Figs. 6, 7. They show an oscillatory fringe pattern
with amplitude damping out to a distance of ≃ 3 − 4 µm and maintaining an essentially constant amplitude from that
point out to the distance limit of the measurements. As indicated in Fig. 2, the fringe pattern results from interference
between the mode directly propagating through the slit (hole) at the input side Et and a surface wave originating
from the single-groove structures Esurf . The wave Esurf is reconverted to a propagating mode at the slit or hole, and
it is this propagating mode that interferes with Et. The frequency and phase of the interference pattern is a function
of the slit (hole)-groove optical path and any intrinsic phase shift of the surface wave itself. The normalised intensity
I/I0 of the superposition term is given by

I
I0

= 1 + η2

i + 2ηi cos γi with ηi =

αβ
δ

where α = Esurf /Ei is the fractional amplitude of the surface wave launched from the incoming ﬁeld Ei at the groove
site, and β is the further fraction of this surface wave reconverted to a propagating wave in the slit, Esl = βEsurf =
βαEi. The fractional amplitude of the directly transmitted component Et is δ and the phase diﬀerence γi between
Et and Esl is the sum of two terms,

γi = ksurf xsg(hg) + ϕint

The ﬁrst term ksurf xsg(hg) is the phase accumulated by the surface wave propagating from the groove to the slit (hole)
and the second term ϕint is any phase shift intrinsic to the surface wave. The term ϕint includes the “signature”
shift of the CDEW plus any phase shift associated with the groove width and depth. Figures 6, 7 present a direct
measure of the normalised amplitude damping with distance, ηi = ηi(x) and the period and phase of the oscillations,
from which the wavelength λsurf of the surface wave, the phase ϕint, and the eﬀective surface index of refraction
nsurf can be determined. Analysis of the frequency spectrum of the fringe pattern for the slit(hole) structures results
in the determination of a surface wavelength λsurf = 819(811) ± 8 nm and an eﬀective surface index of refraction

ters µhl = 0.10 ± 0.02, κhl = 0.08 ± 0.03 µm, and ϕhl

the measured intensities of the six nominally identical naked
holes (no ﬂanking groove) used for normalisation of each mea-
surement. Analysis of the frequency spectrum of the fringe
pattern for the hole-groove structures results in the determi-
nation of a surface wavelength λsurf = 811 ± 8 nm and an
eﬀective surface index of refraction nsurf = 1.05 ± 0.01.

nsurf = 1.04(1.05) ± 0.01. The amplitude ηi of the oscillatory term depends on the slit(hole)-groove distance, and
Figs. 6, 7 show that ηi falls of with increasing distance. This fall-oﬀ is ﬁt to an expression with two terms: an inverse
distance dependence term plus a constant term.

IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

The measured interference fringes on slit(hole) structures exhibit the presence of a surface wave with wavelength
819(811) ± 8 nm and therefore a surface index of refraction nsurf = 1.04(1.05) ± 0.01. The amplitude behavior of
these fringes is also similar. Both the slit-groove and hole-groove structures exhibit an initial amplitude fall-oﬀ with
increasing distance, damping to an essentially constant amplitude at a distance ≃ 6 µm. This behavior is ﬁt to the
expressions in Eqs. 8a, 8b. The ﬁtting procedure is a linear regression varying the relative contributions of the constant
and decaying amplitude terms, µsl(hl) and κsl(hl) and the intrinsic phase shift ϕsl(hl)
. The results are summarized in
Table I.

How do these results compare to CDEW or SPP models? In the CDEW picture, the groove launches a surface wave
on the input side of the silver ﬁlm that is detected by interference with the directly transmitted wave through the hole
or slit, in the far ﬁeld, on the output side of the structure. The amplitude of this surface wave is predicted to damp
as the inverse distance between the groove and the slit or hole. Figures 6, 7 show an initial decrease in amplitude

with increasing distance out to about 3 − 4 µm, but that the amplitude thereafter remains essentially constant. The
solid curves in Figs. 6, 7 ﬁt this amplitude decrease to an inverse distance dependence (Eqs. 8a, 8b). However, the
damping might also plausibly ﬁt an exponential decrease which would be expected from surface plasmon dissipative
processes such as absorption by the silver ﬁlm or scattering due to surface roughness. In order to check this possibility
we have measured the properties of the silver ﬁlms used in these studies. Table II summarises these properties and
compares them to previously reported measurements [14, 15]. The dielectric constant at 852 nm ǫAg = ǫ′
Ag was
measured by ellipsometery and surface roughness parameters determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
root-mean-square (rms) height of the ﬁlms was measured to be δ = 1.29 nm and the correlation length σ = 154.3 nm.
From the imaginary term of the dielectric constant ǫ′′
Ag and the parameters δ, σ the expected propagation lengths of
surface plasmons against absorption, surface scattering, and reradiation, Lams, Lscat, Lrad, can be calculated [4]. It is
clear from columns 5-7 of Table II that these loss processes cannot account for the observed damping within 3 µm of
hole-groove distance.

Ag + ǫ′′

The constant amplitude beyond ∼ 3 − 4 µm is consistent with a persistant surface wave. Indeed we have recorded
measurements (not presented here) of the surface wave persisting at least to ≃ 30 µm slit-groove distance.
It is
important to emphasise, however, that λsurf and nsurf deviate signiﬁcantly for those expected for a pure SPP on a
plane silver surface. Interferometry measurements of the surface waves on “output side” slit-groove structures (not
reported here) conﬁrm the value of nsurf in Table I, and we believe that conventional, inﬁnite-plane SPP theory [4] is
not adequate to explain these results. We note that persistent surface waves over ∼ 10 µm distances have also been
reported in a double slit experiment [16] and interpreted as SPPs [17].

As indicated in Table I, intrinsic phase for the slit-groove and hole-groove structures respectively are ϕsl

int = 0.81 π
and ϕhl
int = 0.55 π. Although one contribution to these phase shifts may be the CDEW “signature” phase shift of π/2,
it is known from earlier studies that the speciﬁc form (width and depth) of the grooves themselves, can introduce
phase shifts into the scattered wave [9]. We have determined the nature of these groove-induced phase shifts and
resonances by measuring interference fringes arising from surface waves launched on the “output-side” of slit-groove
structures. These results, that will be reported in a subsequent publication, support the existence of an intrinsic
phase shift close to π/2.

The interpretation that emerges from these results is that the subwavelength groove originates persistant, long-
range surface waves by a two-step process: (1) the incoming TM polarised plane wave scatters from the groove and
generates in its immediate vicinity on the surface a broad, CDEW-like distribution of diﬀracted evanescent waves,
and (2) this broad-band local surface “emitter” excites, within a distance of ≃ 3 − 4 µm, a long-range surface wave
response. The near-term rapid amplitude decrease in the interference fringes of Figs. 6, 7 is evidence of this evanescent
surface wave diﬀraction very near the groove. Persistant amplitude out to tens of microns is evidence for some kind
of surface wave guided mode. It is signiﬁcant to note that the wavelength and phase of the interference fringes do
not shift over the entire range of the measurements. The initial diﬀracted surface wave components extend over a
broad range of evanescent modes, kx > k0, including the conventional kSPP. Therefore it is to be expected that the
local surface wave emitter excites this surface mode. We emphasise, however, that our measurements show that the
wavelength of this persistant wave does not correspond to kSPP and that, when the phase lag associated the groove

itself is taken into account, the intrinsic phase of the surface wave with respect to the directly transmitted wave is
close to π/2. The disaccord between λSPP and λsurf is for the present a matter of speculation. Perhaps plasmon
“leaky waves” [21] that transport energy very slowly away from the surface contribute to the spectrum of long-range
surface excitation resulting in an eﬀective wavelength shift; or perhaps, despite our ellipsometry measurements, the
surface index of refraction of the metal ﬁlm is slightly modiﬁed by some uncontrolled chemical or material process [22].
At a more practical level, these results indicate that it might be much easier to couple to surface guided waves than
was previously thought. Conventional wisdom asserts that because the SPP lies to the right of the “light line” on
the metal surface dispersion curve, a grating or prism is needed to achieve eﬃcient optical coupling [4]. A simple
abrupt discontinuity in the surface, such as a slit or groove, appears to serve as an eﬃcient coupler. Further studies
are needed to understand the properties of the generated long-range persistant wave and to optimise the eﬃciency of
this groove-coupling process.

V. METHODS

A. Structure fabrication

The structures consist of a single subwavelength slit or hole ﬂanked by one subwavelength groove. The grooves
have a width of 100 nm and a nominal depth of 100 nm for the slit-groove structures and 70 nm for the hole-groove
structures. The slit-groove distance (xsg) or hole-groove distance (xhg) is systematically incremented in the fabrication
process. The subwavelength structures are fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) milling (FEI Nova-600 Dual-Beam
system, Ga+ ions, 30keV) into a layer of silver evaporated onto ﬂat fused silica microscope slides. A low beam
current (50 pA) was used in order to achieve surface features deﬁned with a lateral precision on the order of 10 nm
and characterised by near-vertical sidewalls and a minimal amount of edge rounding. Since it enables delivery of a
variable ion dose to each pixel of the writing ﬁeld, FIB milling conveniently allows the multiple-depth topography
characteristic of the present devices to be formed in a single, self-aligned step. A 2-D matrix of structures is milled
into the silver layer. Each matrix consists of 63 structures, nine columns, separated by 1.5 mm, and seven rows,
separated by 2 mm. The ﬁrst column contains only the slit with no ﬂanking grooves. Light transmission through
the slits in this column is used to normalise the transmission in the remaining columns. Variations in transmission
through each of the elements in the “slits only” column provide a measure of the uniformity of the FIB fabrication
process. Each entire matrix of structures is ﬂanked on one side by a small round hole and on the other by a line
grating for absolute reference positioning and angular alignment of the structure matrix with respect to the input
laser beam. The square microscope slides themselves, commercially available from SPI Supplies, are 25 mm on a side
and 1 mm thick.

B. Measurement Setup

Details of the experimental setup are as follows. Output from a diode laser source, temperature stabilised and
frequency-locked to 2S1/2(F = 4) → 2P3/2(F = 4, 5) crossover feature in a Cs saturated absorption cell, is modulated
at 850 Hz by a mechanical chopper, fed to a monomode optical ﬁbre, focused and ﬁnally linearly polarised before
impinging on the subwavelength structure mounted in the sample holder. The beam waist diameter and confocal
parameter of the illuminating source are 300 µm and 33 cm, respectively. Throughout this series of measurements
the laser power density was maintained ∼ 1Wcm−2. The sample holder itself is ﬁxed to a precision x-y translator,
and multiple structures, FIB-milled in a 2-D array on a single substrate, are successively positioned at the laser beam
waist. The optical response of the structures is synchronously detected by a photodiode and registered on a laboratory
computer as indicated in Fig. 3.

Quantum optical techniques may yield immersion ﬂuids with high indices of refraction without
absorption. We describe one such technique in which a probe ﬁeld experiences a large index of
refraction with ampliﬁcation rather than absorption, and examine its practicality for an immersion
lithography application. Enhanced index can be observed in a three-level system with a tunable,
near-resonant, coherent probe and incoherent pump ﬁeld that inverts population of the probe tran-
sition. This observation contradicts the common belief that large indices of refraction are impossible
without absorption, however it is well in accord with existing electromagnetic theory and practice.
Calculations show that a refractive index ≫ 2 is possible with practical experimental parameters. A
scheme with an incoherent mixture of pumped and unpumped atoms is also examined, and is seen
to have a lower refractive index (∼ 2) accompanied by neither gain nor loss.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Immersion lithography is currently the technology
of choice for integrated circuit fabrication at the 65-
nm-gate-length node.1,2 Further scaling of this technol-
ogy will require either a reduced source wavelength or
a higher-refractive-index immersion ﬂuid. But eﬀorts
to make economical sources and optics at wavelengths
shorter than 193 nanometers have so far been unsuccess-
ful. Additionally, refractive-index scaling is often dene-
grated based on classical arguments that index enhance-
ment near an atomic resonance is always accompanied
by absorption. Thus it may appear that device scaling
is nearing its end. However, when atomic resonances are
treated quantum-mechanically, the connection between
absorption and index enhancement can be circumvented.
In this paper, we apply quantum-optical techniques to
the problem of index enhancement for continued scaling
of optical lithography.

of refraction (n
In this scheme, a near-resonant probe laser experiences
a high refractive index in a pumped quantum system.
The refractive index is a function of both the intrin-
sic properties of the quantum system, such as sponta-
neous decay rates, and the controllable properties, such
as atomic density.4 A few possible applications of this
scheme are immersion lithography,1,2 microscopy,5 all-
optical switching, and optical buﬀering6. While previ-
ous proposals for phase-coherent quantum-optics-based
index-enhancement techniques promise an appreciable
refractive index with no absorption,7,8,9,10,11,12 only en-
10−4 have in fact been demon-
hancements of ∆n
strated due to practical experimental obstacles.13 On
the other hand, our calculations show that a maximum
6 is possible with our scheme for
refractive-index of
reasonable experimental parameters.
In principle, the
refractive index can be enhanced beyond 6 with a higher
atomic density. In addition, our scheme should prove eas-
ier to implement than existing schemes based on quan-
tum interference because the pump and probe lasers do

≈

∼

not need to be collinear or phase-locked. Thus our pro-
posed scheme is likely to be more practical and more ef-
fective than existing quantum-optical schemes at achiev-
ing enhanced index without absorption.

To apply the proposed scheme to immersion lithogra-
phy, several issues would have to be resolved. An im-
mersion medium consisting of a pumped quantum sys-
tem would generate poor image contrast due to ampli-
ﬁed spontaneous emission. Additionally, due to power
broadening, the refractive-index rapidly decays from its
enhanced value to unity in a short propagation distance.
These issues are discussed in Sec. III. A solution to some
of the problems is suggested in Sec. IV where we describe
a system composed of a mixture of quantum gases de-
scribed by absorptive two-level quantum systems and am-
plifying (pumped) three-level quantum systems probed
by a single laser.9 The mixture exhibits enhanced index
of refraction without loss or gain.

unpumped system, a probe beam tuned near resonance
experiences a high refractive index, but is absorbed in a
fraction of a wavelength. In our scheme, we use a pump
laser to invert population on the probe transition. A
probe beam interacting with a population-inverted tran-
sition also experiences a high refractive index but is am-
pliﬁed instead of absorbed. In the following section, we
specify the parameters of our system.

A. Energy level structure

We chose to illustrate our index-enhancement scheme
in a three-level system as shown in Fig. 1, although other
three-level or four-level systems will also suﬃce. The

Index enhancement for unbroadened thin media

To calculate the refractive index as seen by the probe
laser, we formulate the density matrix equations of
motion14 for the system. The population in level
is
denoted by the on-diagonal density matrix element ρii

and decays into another level
at rate Γij. The coher-

ence between levels
is given by ρij and decays

at rate γij. A phenomenological treatment of sponta-
neous decay rates and coherence decay rates leads to the
following equations:

only for inﬁnitesimally thin media. Figure 2(a) was ob-
tained by expanding Eq. (3) to ﬁrst order in ΩR, setting
rac = 0, and substituting the result into Eq. (2). From
this plot, it is evident that a large susceptibility is possi-
ble, but at the cost of high absorption. Figure 2(b) was

The refractive index can be calculated from the sus-
ceptibilities via n = n′ + in′′ = √1 + χ where n′ denotes
the refractive index, while n′′ is the absorption coeﬃcient
of the medium. For the parameters used for Fig. 2(b),
at the optimum detuning, the refractive index can be as
high as
6. It is possible to enhance the refractive index
still further: n′ can be increased by opting for an atomic
species with diﬀerent intrinsic parameters, e.g. a larger
dipole matrix element for the
transition. An-
other way to increase n′ is by changing the controllable
atomic parameters, e.g. by using a vapor with a high
atomic density. The eﬀect of this change is shown in Fig.
3, where we have plotted the maximum achievable refrac-
tive index n′
max with respect to detuning as a function of
the atomic density. As the plot shows, an increase in the

Index enhancement for broadened, thin media

To evaluate the eﬀect of temperature on the refractive
index, we consider the eﬀects of collisional, Doppler, and
power broadening. Throughout this subsection, however,
we neglect eﬀects of the propagation of the probe beam.
Thus these results apply only for inﬁnitesimally thin me-
dia. Propagation eﬀects will be discussed later. We will
now elaborate on the various broadening mechanisms:

1. Non-radiative collisional broadening is attributed
to the random change in the phase of atomic wave-
functions that results from elastic collisions. Non-
radiative collisional broadening dominates over ra-
diative collisional broadening that occurs due to
inelastic collisions.16 Collisional broadening was
taken into account by adding an extra decay term
in the equations of motion for the oﬀ-diagonal ma-
trix element ρba. The decay term is given by16
ctrsN (πkBT /M )1/2, where dctrs is the average
4d2
distance between atoms during a collision, T is the
temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and M
is the mass of the colliding atoms.

2. Power broadening occurs for probe intensities so
large that the Rabi frequency ΩR is greater than
the natural decay rate for the
transition.
Power broadening was taken into account by sim-
ply using the full expression in Eq. (3) rather than
taking it only to ﬁrst order in ΩR.

3. Doppler broadening occurs when a moving atom
interacts with the probe ﬁeld and sees a frequency
shift due to the Doppler eﬀect. Interaction of the
probe ﬁeld with the temperature-dependent veloc-
ity distribution of the atomic vapor then leads to
broadening of the absorption lineshape. Doppler
broadening was taken into account by numerically
performing a convolution integral between the line-
shape function for Doppler broadening and the
lineshape for susceptibility. The lineshape func-
tion for Doppler broadening, when expressed in
terms of ∆, is a normal distribution with variance
(2π/λba)2kBT /M .

These three mechanisms together act to broaden and
reduce the peak value of the refractive index. Figure 4
shows a plot of the refractive index as a function of detun-
ing for a pumped system at various temperatures. The
maximum value of the refractive index gets reduced from
1.5 at room temperature, while the entire
∼
curve broadens as the temperature is increased.17 While
Doppler broadening was the dominant mechanism that
lead to a decline in refractive index for the parameters
chosen, power broadening contributed more signiﬁcantly
when propagation eﬀects were included. This issue is dis-
cussed in the following section along with the problem of
ampliﬁed spontaneous emission.

IMPLEMENTATION HURDLES

The engineering issues that need to be addressed in
order for a pumped atomic system to be used as an im-
mersion medium are:

1. the medium has to be chemically and phys-
immersion-

ically compatible with conventional
lithography systems and processing techniques;

2. the pumping scheme geometry must not inadver-
tantly expose the photoresist. A pump ﬁeld di-
rected towards the photoresist may be a problem if
the pump frequency falls within the exposure spec-
trum of the photoresist;

3. it may not be practical to have an immersion
2
medium with refractive indices higher than
due to the current unavailability of high-index pho-
toresists. One solution may be to use thin resists
that can be exposed using evanescent ﬁelds.18 This
problem will be faced by any index-enhancement
scheme used for immersion lithography.

∼

In this paper, we will not discuss these issues in detail
because we believe that with appropriate chemical and
optical engineering, they could in principle be resolved.
Instead we will focus for now on two potential ‘show-
stoppers,’ both a consequence of high gain in the medium.
In the following section, we show that power broadening
reduces the initially high refractive index within a very
short propagation distance. In Sec. III B, we discuss the
eﬀect of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission in an immersion
lithography application.

FIG. 5: Refractive index n′ as a function of propagation dis-
tance z in the atomic medium for various detunings ∆. The
index of refraction decreases as a function of z due to an in-
crease in power broadening as the propagating probe beam
undergoes ampliﬁcation. Parameters used are I[z = 0] =
103 W/m2 and N = 1016 atoms/cm3. See Fig. 2 caption for
other parameters.

A. Power broadening

While power broadening had a negligible eﬀect for
it becomes the domi-
an inﬁnitesimally thin medium,
nant mechanism that lowers the refractive index when
propagation of the probe ﬁeld in a macroscopic immer-
sion medium is considered. A qualitative understanding
comes from the following reasoning: as the intensity of
the probe beam increases (i.e. ΩR increases) due to am-
pliﬁcation, the population diﬀerence (see Eq. (3)), and
thus the refractive index, both decrease. The eﬀect can
be calculated for a propagation distance z within a sam-
ple by numerically solving the diﬀerential equation

where I is the intensity of the probe beam. Note that
n′ and n′′ are both functions of I and therefore z. The
result of Runge-Kutta integration of Eq. (4) for various
detunings is plotted in Fig. 5. The plot reveals an inher-
ent trade-oﬀ between refractive index and propagation
distance: if one is willing to settle for a lower refractive
index (achieved by increasing the detuning ∆), then the
maximum distance in the medium in which that index
can be maintained (before n′ decays rapidly to 1) is in-
creased. However, for technologically interesting indices
of refraction (greater than 2), the maximum thickness
4 µm for an atomic density of 1016 atoms/cm3. A
is
medium only 4 µm thick may present arduous practi-
cal challenges to implement in an immersion lithography
tool. The following section explores another critical chal-
lenge to implementation.

∼

B. Ampliﬁed spontaneous emission

Ampliﬁed spontaneous emission is a problem endemic
to many optical systems, including Erbium-doped ﬁber

∼

ampliﬁers (EDFA),19 and master oscillator power ampli-
ﬁers (MOPA).20 In our system, the gain medium ampli-
ﬁes photons not only in the probe beam, but also photons
that originate from spontaneous-emission events. In one
simulation, we found that spontaneous emission was am-
pliﬁed by a factor of
100 in a propagation distance of
only 1 µm. This magnitude of ampliﬁcation is undesir-
able for two reasons: (1) an atom that has undergone
stimulated emission from a spontaneous emission photon
is unavailable for emission stimulated by a probe-beam
photon, thus the population inversion is reduced, leading
to a reduction in the refractive index of the medium; and
(2) a large amount of noise from spontaneous emission
reduces the image contrast in an immersion lithography
application. In the following section, we discuss a scheme
that mitigates both this eﬀect and power-broadening is-
sues.

IV. A SCHEME FOR HIGH-n WITH NEITHER
GAIN NOR LOSS

One solution to the power broadening and ampliﬁed
spontaneous emission problems is to ﬁnd a scheme that
eliminates gain altogether, yet still retains enhanced
refractive index. Electromagnetically induced trans-
parency would achieve this,7 as would a simple mixture
of absorptive and amplifying high-index components in
the medium.9 We examine such a scheme in the follow-
ing section, using the results of Fig. 2, which shows that
absorptive unpumped systems and amplifying pumped
systems both exhibit high refractive indices near reso-
nance.

A. Energy level structure

We

examine a scheme with a homogeneously-
distributed, equal mixture of absorptive two-level sys-
tems and amplifying three-level systems probed concur-
rently by a single probe beam. Fig. 6 shows the energy
level structure of such a scheme. The mixture consists
of uncoupled two- and three-level systems with slightly
diﬀerent resonant frequencies on the probe transition
(ωba
= ωed). The two-level system is detuned from the
probe ﬁeld by ∆u while the three-level system is detuned
by ∆p. We now describe the calculation of refractive
index for this system.

B. Calculation details and result

The calculation for the refractive index for this scheme
is a simple extension of the calculation for the pumped
system given in Sec. II B. We ﬁrst found the suscep-
tibilities for both pumped and unpumped systems sepa-
rately, denoted by χp and χu respectively. To ﬁnd χp as a
function of ∆p, we substituted parameters speciﬁc to the

pumped system (e.g. detuning ∆p, wavelength of probe
transition λp, atomic density Np) in Eqs. (2) and (3).
The susceptibility for the unpumped system was found
by letting rac = 0 in Eq. (3) and substituting parameters
speciﬁc to the unpumped system (∆u, λu, Nu). We then
found the susceptibility of the mixture χmix = χp + χu,
and expressed χmix in terms of the average detuning
∆ = (∆u + ∆p)/2. Finally, we computed the refractive
index as seen by the probe ﬁeld from nmix = √1 + χmix.

6

Figure 7 shows the dependence of refractive index on
detuning for a system with an equal mixture of pumped
and unpumped atoms. The plot of n′′
mix shows that there
is a region of absorption where n′′
mix > 0 and a region of
gain where n′′
mix < 0. Corresponding to the minima and
maxima of the n′′
mix curve are resonant peaks in the plot
of n′
mix: one corresponding to the pumped species and
the other to the unpumped atomic species. The most in-
teresting and important feature of this plot is that there
mix plot where n′′
is a point on the n′′
mix = 0. For that de-
tuning, a probe ﬁeld propagating in the medium would
experience neither gain nor loss. In eﬀect, the medium
becomes transparent to the probe ﬁeld but by a very
diﬀerent mechanism than electromagnetically induced
transparency.9 Moreover, at the transparency point the
refractive index is greatly enhanced: for this example it
is more than 2.

V. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK

The central result of this paper is the presentation of
6 for

a scheme for refractive-index enhancement (n′

∼

the example system) accompanied by gain rather than
absorption. We showed that one can achieve extremely
high refractive indices, but only for a very thin layer of
the atomic medium. We identiﬁed the main implementa-
tion hurdles as power broadening and ampliﬁed sponta-
neous emission, both due to the high gain experienced by
the probe beam. Finally, we examined a modiﬁed scheme
consisting of a mixture of pumped and unpumped sys-
tems to tackle these problems and to achieve enhanced
refractive index without either gain or loss.

We believe that quantum-optical techniques that take
advantage of high susceptibilities near atomic resonances
may not only result in a high-index medium for next-
generation immersion lithography, but also represent a
new direction for refractive-index engineering.
Indeed,
an all-optically-controllable refractive index can be use-
ful for applications in optical communications and mi-
croscopy. Future work will concentrate on ﬁnding quan-
tum systems with which we can experimentally verify the
predictions made in this paper.

one can distinguish three levels and an appropriate prob-

15 The values for Γba and λba are representative of typical
atomic parameters. They correspond to the 41S0 (|ai) to
41P1 (|bi) transition in atomic calcium. Level |ci is as-
sumed to be an upper lying energy level which can decay
to |bi via multiple decays. The analysis is not substantially
diﬀerent for other atomic species that can be modelled by
a three-level system.

17 As discussed previously, we may enhanced the refractive

index further by an increase in atomic density.

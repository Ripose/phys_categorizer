Abstract

Some consequences of spatio-temporal symmetry for the deterministic
decomposition of complex light ﬁelds into factorized components are con-
sidered. This enables to reveal interrelations between spatial and temporal
coherence properties of wave. An estimation of average number of the de-
composition terms is obtained in the case of statistical ensemble of light
pulses.

Keywords: partial coherence, modal decompositions

1. INTRODUCTION

Modal description of light coherence, being a multidimensional generalisation
of the well-known Karhunen-Lo´eve expansion, was ﬁrst introduced in optics by
Gamo[1]. In short, the essence of the approach lies in the fact that any correlation
function of a ﬁeld E(r, t) — in particular the transverse beam coherence ΓS(r, r′)
— can be expressed as a superposition of factorized components

In (1) the transverse correlation function ΓS(r, r′) is determined as a time
average (over the pulse duration or time of registration) and, in this sense, it
is a deterministic characteristic of any particular wave. In the case of statistical
ensemble of similar pulses the time averaging can be replaced by statistical one or
both types of averaging may be combined. Formally it has no eﬀect on relations
(1) – (3), but, as it will be seen later, changes their physical meaning.

The modal expansion (1) – (3), as well as its modiﬁcation for space-frequency
domain[2, 3], is broadly used in coherence theory as a convenient tool for estima-
tion of entropy and informational capacity of light beams[1], as the best method
for modelling of coherence properties of a complex light wave with a ﬁnite set of
simple mutually incoherent waves[4], and so on. These relations constitute the
mathematical basis for proof of various types of uncertainty inequalities[5].

The next principal step in the development of the modal formalism was made
by Pasmanik and Sidorovich[6]. They demonstrated the spatio-temporal symme-
try for decomposition (1) – (3), that leads to some important relations between
spatial and temporal coherence characteristics of light waves. The discussion of
them both in deterministic form and under application of the ensemble averaging
is a main goal of the present paper.

2. DUAL APPROACH OVERVIEW

Let us suppose that for some waveﬁeld E(r, t), where r is a two-dimensional
radius-vector at a plane z = const, the modal expansion (1) – (3) is known. So
far the solutions of the integral equation (2) form a complete functional basis
(when including the functions, corresponding to zero eigenvalues[7]), one can
deﬁne a set of projections of the initial ﬁeld onto this basis

that, in turn, allows to build up a modal representation of the ﬁeld itself

Last relation can be proved by direct substitution of deﬁnition (4) into (6) and
accounting (3). It is just this mutual orthogonality of temporal functions en(t),
that leads to absence of any interference between diﬀerent terms of spatial basis.
Another approach to evaluation of temporal basis (4) lies in use of dual integral

equation

where ΓT (t, t′) is a global temporal correlation function of the ﬁeld E(r, t)

In contrast to the standard deﬁnition[2] (with averaging over the time or en-
semble of pulses) the averaging procedure in (8) is carried out over the beam
cross-section. Hence, the function ΓT (t, t′) expresses the overall correlation the
wavefront patterns and is closely related to the degree of similarity[8, 9] H(t, t′)
of the waveﬁeld for consequent time moments

One can easily see that equations (2) and (7) make up two equivalent dual
variants for evaluation the decomposition (5). Both equations have identical
spectra of eigenvalues and for complete description of modal structure of ﬁeld
n(r) or en(t). The second can

(9)

The last variant (6) – (9) has an advantage of dealing with 1-D task. One
more exact consequence of the dual formalism is that two functions ΓS(r, r′)
and ΓT (t, t′) in the case of no degeneracy (all un are diﬀerent) allow one to
completely reconstruct the form of ﬁeld. Under degeneration (e. g. when ui = uj)
i(r) +
the ambiguity arises from the fact that two diﬀerent wave structures ei(t)
i(r) produce the same correlation functions (1),

(8).

Strictly speaking, the modal structure of the ﬁeld does not remain constant
under the wave propagation, but mode mixing is comparatively low for quasi-
monochromatic beams with small divergence[6]. That is why the deterministic
dual decomposition (5) is inherently aimed to description of laser pulses and has
been ﬁrst applied in nonlinear optics[9], where the partial coherence just means
a high complexity of interacting waves.

In practice the complete modal description can be fulﬁlled only for very few
classes of models[10, 11], what is, ﬁrst of all, related with intricacy of integral
equations (2), (7) solving. Therefore those consequences of the method are taking
the special signiﬁcance, for which one does not need to know the exact basic
functions en(t),

n(r).

3. EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF MODES

So far as the mode number n in general cannot be univalently associated with
any other parameter of partial wave (except its energy), the only natural way
to restore distribution of un, without solving (2), (7), is evaluation of nonlinear
n uk
k-order moments of modal spectra
n. It can be done with use of iterated
kernels theorem via sequential integration of functions ΓS(r, r′) or ΓT (t, t′). The
moment of 1st order has a trivial meaning of total ﬁeld energy

As it shown in Ref. 12, the higher moments determine a probability distri-
bution of wave amplitude under conditions of wave mixing at a strong scatterer.
The most important characteristic of ﬁeld structure is an eﬀective number of
terms in decompositions (1), (5), (8)[1, 6, 13], which is expressed through 2nd
order moment

The value of Neﬀ speciﬁes the ability of the total ﬁeld to produce interference
eﬀects between two arbitrary separate points of the beam cross-section[6, 12] and
changes from unity for spatial coherent one-mode wave to inﬁnity for completely
incoherent ﬁeld.

Two equivalent forms of (10) reﬂect real interconnection between spatial and
temporal parameters of a beam. If one determines eﬀective area of beam cross-
section — Seﬀ , area of spatial coherence — σc, pulse duration — Teﬀ and corre-
lation time — τc in the form

It means that number of coherence zones per beam cross-section is equal to
number of diﬀerent spatial patterns over the pulse duration.

Three of introduced in (11) parameters — Teﬀ , Seﬀ , σc — have quite tradi-
tional meaning[13] and need no special remarks. The averaged over beam cross-
section coherence time τc describes time of global changing of ﬁeld structure or,
t′ of the degree of similarity H(t, t′) of
in other words, characteristic width by t

spatial wave patterns. Deﬁnitions (10), (11) have no sensitivity to overall phase
modulation of the ﬁeld

⇐⇒

and, therefore, value of τc can rather signiﬁcantly diﬀer from local correlation
time, which is deﬁned in signal theory.

4. APPLICATION OF STATISTICAL AVER-
AGING

Till this point the basic formalism has dealt with a wave-ﬁeld E(r, t) as with the
deterministic one. At the same time classical coherence theory usually operates
with radiation characteristics, averaged over ensemble of similar ﬁelds, because in
the majority of cases the individual pulse parameters are not of interest. Hence,
the natural question arises — how can such stochastic hypotheses inﬂuence on
the results of previous analysis?

i

h

ΓT (t, t′)

As a ﬁrst step let us consider what statistical averaging gives at the stage of the
basic integral equations (2), (7) formulation. Just as in the standard approach[1],
one can substitute the kernels ΓS(r, r′) and ΓT (t, t′) with their averages
ΓS(r, r′)
i
and
. However it is evident, that transversal correlation function (1),
averaged over time interval only, contains much more information about spatial
does. The approximate
structure of a beam, than similar value of
equality can take place only in the limit of inﬁnite pulse duration and under
quasiergodicity of the ensemble. Exactly the same with appropriate changing
of words can be stated about temporal correlation function ΓT (t, t′). It is easy
to see that such a lack of information breaks the main property of the present
formalism — its spatio-temporal duality.

ΓS(r, r′)
h

i

As a result of this procedure the interpretation of the relations (1) – (4) and
(6) – (9) must be changed. All other conclusions of the above sections (with
exception of equality (12), which disappears) remain valid if taking into account
that now we talk about two diﬀerent and complementary means for describing of
coherence of random pulse ensemble (but not for a particular wave). For transver-
sal coherence this will be nonstationary variant of Gamo’s treatment[1] and for
temporal correlation function it will have the form of modiﬁed Karhunen-Lo´eve
expansion[14] with double averaging — over ensemble and beam cross-section.

In the subsequent discussion we shall utilise the fact that for each decomposition
one can introduce its own number of degrees of freedom (10) — spatial NS and
temporal NT

(13.a)

(13.b)

Now it is clear that in order to preserve spatio-temporal duality of the formal-
ism, the ensemble averaging should be applied at the later stages of consideration.
As an example of such approach let us estimate the number of terms in the modal
decomposition of a mean light pulse from the ensemble. The simplest and the
most popular type of ﬁeld statistics is Gaussian. In this case the coarse estimation
can be done by averaging of integrals in deﬁnition of Neﬀ (10), that, accounting
the splitting of higher correlations and (13), gives a very simple formula

Neﬀ =

NSNT
NS + NT

.

(14)

On the basis of general reasons one can formulate some more requirements,
which a priori should be satisﬁed by any admissible dependence Neﬀ (NS, NT ).
Thus, the function Neﬀ (NS, NT ) must be symmetrical about permutation of its
arguments because of the dual status of spatial and temporal degrees of freedom

Neﬀ (NS, NT ) = Neﬀ (NT , NS).

(15)

The value of Neﬀ must be a non-decreasing function of its arguments, that with
(13) leads to conclusion

Ensemble with only one degree of freedom in any of the basic subspaces corre-
sponds to coherent (in terms of (5)) ﬁeld

It is easy to see that estimation (14) obeys all above requirements but the last
one, i. e. it poorly describes the region of small numbers of degrees of freedom (it
is the consequence of approximate way of averaging
). The situation can
be improved by taking into account the ﬂuctuations not only of the denominator,
but also of the numerator (energy of light pulses) of expression (10)

Correction ε must satisfy the condition (15) and have the order of magnitude
ε
1/(NSNT ), that can be conﬁrmed by consideration cross-spectrally pure
light[15], when correlation function factorizes. Hence, the reﬁned estimation of
the number of modes in the mean pulse may be written as following

∝

Neﬀ =

NSNT + 1
NS + NT

.

(16)

For the ﬁrst time estimation like (16) was given without a proof in paper[16]
for a system of several identical, statistically independent emitters with drifting
phase. At limit NS, NT
1 appropriate formula from Ref. 16 converts to
(14). One can point out some more cases, which asymptotically lead to the same
dependence. All this allows to say that area of applicability of relation (14) as
estimation of N eﬀ is much wider than above assumptions.

In order to illustrate the consequences from relation (14) we can consider a

very vivid example of the ensemble of Schell-model ﬁelds[10, 17]

One of the possible interpretations of model (17) corresponds to illustrative situ-
ation when a fast shutter cuts oﬀ a pulse of radiation from a primary steady-state
uniform partially coherent source. Then just beyond the shutter the degree of
coherence γ(r, t) is speciﬁed by statistical parameters of the source only (say,
with σ, τ being an area and a time of correlation, respectively), while I(r, t) is
(within a factor) a deterministic function of the shutter transmittance (S, T —
the shutter aperture area and the time it is opened). On substituting (17) into
(13) and accounting (11), (14) one can assure that the eﬀective area of coherence
(in the mean pulse) depends not only on spatial parameters, but as well on ratio
between temporal characteristics T /τ of the primary source and the shutter. And
vice versa, the lifetime of a particular wavefront structure in the mean pulse is
also determined by the ratio of S/σ. It explains the signiﬁcance of the discussed
modal formalism for the nonlinear optical and laser beam problems.

5. DISCUSSION

In conclusion it is worth to point out the resemblance of the considered modal
technique with bi-orthogonal decompositions used in other branches of physics
— e. g. turbulence theory[7] and pattern recognition[14]. Such tie is based on the
common concept of complex process representation. By this analogy, the spatial
partial coherence may be described as a sequence of more or less similar frames
(instant waveﬁeld structures) replacing each other. From this viewpoint coherent
modes specify the feature basis of wavefronts evolution.

7

According to the general concept the application of global ensemble averaging
procedure is eﬃcient (it gives results with comparatively small relative variance)
when the number of modes in the mean pulse is high. Nevertheless, there are
situations where under small Neﬀ the number of the ensemble degrees of freedom
Neﬀ ). In this
in one of the subspaces is much more than it (NT
case the statistical averaging over the corresponding complex substructure of the
ﬁeld may be useful.

Neﬀ or NS

≫

How it is seen from (5), each single mode in deterministic decomposition
produces factorized correlation function, i. e. corresponds to cross-spectral pure
light[15]. But if we go to the whole multimode ﬁeld, the spectral purity vanishes.
Moreover, for the statistical ensemble even one-mode ﬁeld will, in general, not be
cross-spectral pure.

Besides the discussed manifestations of spatio-temporal symmetry for modal
decomposition, there exists a wide class of uncertainty relations[5], where it must
also appear. They should have the form of inequalities bounding modal charac-
teristics with such parameters of wave as angular divergence and spectral band-
width. This statement leans against the fact that proof of uncertainty relations
for correlation functions does not depend on the type of averaging used.

We show that the solution of fully nonlinear lasing equations for stadium cavities exhibits a highly
directional emission pattern. This directionality can be well explained by a ray-dynamical model,
where the dominant ray-escape dynamics is governed by the unstable manifolds of the unstable short
periodic orbits for the stadium cavity. Investigating the cold-cavity modes relevant for the lasing,
we found that all of the high-Q modes have the emission directionality corresponding to that of the
ray-dynamical model.

Establishing

correspondence

the
ray/classical picture
and the wave/quantum pic-
ture has been a fundamental problem in the ﬁeld of
wave/quantum chaos [1]. One encounters this problem
when trying to understand the emission properties from
two-dimensional (2D) microcavity lasers. In such lasers,
as a way to extract highly directional emission, it has
been proposed to deform the cavity shape smoothly from
perfect circularity [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The result is that rays
start to exhibit a variety of dynamics from integrable to
strongly chaotic, which is tunable by the deformation.

The ray picture has been providing a simple and in-
tuitive method to explain experimental observations of
emission directionality. For instance, emission direction-
ality has been associated with the existence of a periodic
orbit with a particular geometry [6, 7], drastic shape-
dependence of emission directionality has been success-
fully explained by the diﬀerence of phase space structure
[8], and the far-ﬁeld intensity patterns have been closely
reproduced by ray-tracing simulations [8, 9, 10].

Among various cavity shapes, the stadium is a sim-
ple geometry for which ray dynamics has been rigorously
proven to become strongly chaotic [11]. For almost all ini-
tial conditions, a ray trajectory explores the entire phase
space uniformly. Even for such a strongly chaotic cav-
ity, if one considers refractive emission of light due to the
dielectric nature of the cavity, the emission pattern can
become highly directional. Namely, strongly chaotic dy-
namics and highly directional emission are compatible,
as was demonstrated by Schwefel et al.
[8], who associ-
ated this property with escape dynamics dominated by
ﬂow in phase space along the unstable manifolds of the
unstable short periodic orbits of a chaotic system.

In this paper, we report further evidence for the abil-
ity of a ray-dynamical model to describe the lasing states
of 2D microcavities. Earlier work has focused on estab-
lishing a relationship between the ray model and a few
quasi-bound state solutions of the linear wave equation,
without pumping or gain. Which modes to choose for
comparison in this case has an intrinsic arbitrariness,
although plausibility arguments can be made based on
their Q values. Here we show that the solution of the full
nonlinear lasing equations for a stadium cavity, uniquely

determined by the pumping conditions, has highly direc-
tional emission in good agreement with the ray model.
This is one of the ﬁrst pieces of evidence that the multi-
mode solutions of nonlinear wave equations can be un-
derstood in terms of the classical limit of its linear coun-
terpart.

Firstly,

it is shown that a ray model for the sta-
dium cavity exhibits highly directional far-ﬁeld emission.
Throughout this Letter, we ﬁx the aspect ratio of the sta-
dium to a/r = 6/7, where r and a are the radius of the
semicircles and the half-length of the straight segments,
respectively (Fig. 1 (a)). The appearance of strong di-
rectionality depends heavily on the value of the refractive
index of the cavity nin. We set nin = 1.49, which corre-
sponds to the index for polymer cavities[8].

The ray model is constructed on the basis of Snell’s
and Fresnel’s laws [3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14]. Inside
the cavity, the dynamics of a ray is viewed as the motion
of a point particle moving freely except for reﬂections at
the cavity boundary. The ray dynamics can be reduced
to a two-dimensional area-preserving mapping by intro-
ducing the Birkhoﬀ coordinates (s, sin φ), where s is the
arc-length along the cavity boundary and φ is the the
angle of incidence (Fig. 1(a)). Taking into account the
dielectric nature of the cavity, we consider the emission
of rays to the outside of the cavity, which is done in the
following manner. Each ray is initially assigned a certain
amount of intensity. This intensity decreases whenever a
ray collides with the cavity boundary, where the amount
of the emitted-ray intensity is determined by Fresnel’s
law, while the ray’s emission angle is given by Snell’s

gular unstable periodic orbit.

law.

In the ray model simulations, we prepare the initial en-
semble of rays to be uniformly distributed in the phase
space spanned by the Birkhoﬀ coordinates. After some
transient, the total intensity of rays inside the cavity de-
creases exponentially as a function of time [14]. In such a
stationary regime, we measure the intensity distribution
for the emitted-rays I(s, sin φ).

The qualitative explanation for strong emission direc-
tionality in such a chaotic system was given by Schwe-
fel et al [8]; the unstable short periodic orbits act like
anisotropic ”scattering centers” in phase space, causing
directional ﬂow along their unstable manifolds until the
critical angle for escape is reached. For shapes like the
stadium there exists a ”line of constant far-ﬁeld” corre-
sponding to the set of values of the angle of incidence
φ and angular position on the boundary s at which a
ray refracts in the same far-ﬁeld angular direction. The
line of constant far-ﬁeld closest to the unstable manifold
then predicts the dominant emission directionality. Note
that all of the relevant short orbits have closely nested
unstable manifolds so this gives a unique prediction [8].
The data in Fig 2 are in agreement with this picture.
In Fig. 2, I(s, sin φ) is plotted overlaid with the unsta-
ble manifolds of the rectangular unstable periodic orbit
(Fig. 1(b)) located near the critical line for total internal
reﬂection, i.e., sin φ = 1/nin We see that the high escape
intensity region consists of narrow stripes corresponding
closely to the unstable manifolds. Moreover, one can see
that two stripes of high intensity (marked by arrows) are
almost parallel to the constant far-ﬁeld curve for θ = 210◦
(red curve), where the angular coordinate θ is deﬁned as

Now, we investigate whether one can ﬁnd the same
emission directionality for the lasing states for this cav-
ity. We describe the light ﬁeld by the Maxwell equations,
and assume that the active medium consists of two-level
atoms obeying the Bloch equations. In the description
using the Maxwell and Bloch equations, the ﬁeld vari-
ables oscillate rapidly at a frequency close to the transi-
tion frequency ω0 of the two-level atoms. To perform the
long-term time-evolutions necessary to obtain stationary
lasing solutions, we employ the Schr¨odinger-Bloch (SB)

model, which describes the time-evolution of the slowly
varying envelopes of the ﬁeld variables [15, 16, 17, 18].

Unless otherwise mentioned, the cavity size is r =

comes about 105 times as large as the light wavelength

in. For the
above choice of the parameter values, around 100 cavity
modes have positive linear gain. For such a condition,
there occur complicated interactions between the modes,
such as mode-pulling and mode-pushing, that generally
yield a multi-mode lasing solution [16, 17]. We are inter-
ested in the far-ﬁeld patterns arising from these multi-
mode lasing solutions; we now formulate a convenient
method for ﬁnding this quantity on the basis of the ﬁeld
data just outside the cavity.

In Fig. 3(A), we plot

(θ) for the stationary lasing
solution of the SB model. One can see a strikingly good
agreement between the result from the SB model and
that from the ray model. It is remarkable that the far-
ﬁeld pattern of the SB model reproduces not only the
5◦, 175◦, 185◦
highest peaks, but also the tiny ones at θ
and 355◦. The magniﬁcation of the ﬁrst quadrant is
shown in Fig. 3(B), where the results for the cavity sizes
r = 33.88 and 16.94 are also presented. The invariance
of the peak positions with respect to the change of the
cavity size convinces us that our system with r = 67.77
is well inside the semiclassical regime.

≈

One natural approach to explain the appearance of the
emission directionality in the SB model is based on the
study of the cold-cavity modes. Analyzing the power
spectrum for the electric ﬁeld of the lasing solution for
r = 67.77, we conﬁrmed that it consists of multiple lasing
modes, with the major contribution being from six lasing
modes, and these all exhibit strong far-ﬁeld emission at
30◦, 150◦, 210◦ and 330◦. From this result, we can
θ
infer that cold-cavity modes with the above directionality
are preferentially excited. To investigate the origin of this
mode selection, we study below the cold-cavity modes,
focusing on the dependence of the emission directionality
upon the Q-value, which is one of the important factors
for the mode selection.

In the SB model, a cold-cavity mode, E(x, y, t) =
C), is a solution of Eq. (1) with α = µ =
e−iξtψ(x, y) (ξ

ψ(x, y) = 0.

30◦. In other word,
stronger the far-ﬁeld emission at θ
at least in this case the directional modes based on the
unstable manifolds also correspond to the high-Q modes
and are thus preferentially selected for lasing, while in
general we expect that other factors besides the Q value
will come into the mode selection, such as mode volume
and spatial hole-burning eﬀects.

We note that recently Lebental et al. have succeeded
in experimentally observing highly directional emission
for a polymer stadium cavity [19]. Their cavity has the
aspect ratio a/r = 0.8, which is close to the ratio of
our cavity, a/r = 0.857. Strong far-ﬁeld emission at
30◦, 150◦, 210◦ and 330◦ has also been observed in
θ
the experiment. A conspicuous diﬀerence between the
numerical and experimental far-ﬁeld data is that one of
[19])
the peak in the experimental data (Fig. 4 in Ref.
has a three times larger intensity than the other three
peaks. This is however due to the lifetime eﬀect of the
laser dye used in the experiment.

≈

In summary, we demonstrated via numerical simula-
tions of the nonlinear lasing equations that the stadium-
cavity laser exhibits a highly directional emission pattern
in good agreement with the ray model, which predicts
emission directionality based on the geometry of the un-
stable manifolds of short periodic orbits. Furthermore we
conﬁrmed that for the stadium in this parameter range
all of the high-Q modes exhibit this high emission direc-
tionality.

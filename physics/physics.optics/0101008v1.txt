Abstract Molecular sieves, such as nanoporous AlPO4-5, can host a wide variety of laser active dyes. We
embedded pyridine 2 molecules as a representative of a commercially available dye which ﬁts into the
channel pores of the host matrix. Many eﬃcient dye molecules, such as rhodamines, do not ﬁt into the
pores. But modifying the structure of the dyes to appear like the used templates allows to increase the
amount of encapsulated dyes. The properties of resulting microlasers depend on size and shape of the
microresonators, and we discuss a model for microscopic hexagonal ring resonators. In terms of pump
needed to reach lasing threshold molecular sieve microlasers are comparable to VCSELs. For dyes which
ﬁt into the pores we observed a partial regeneration of photo-induced damage.

1 Introduction

Table 1. Lattice constants and free pore diameter φ of molec-
ular sieves with linear channels [13].

In recent years dye laser emission from from crystalline
materials attracted considerable interest [1,2]. At the same
time in solid state dye lasers based on polymer matrices
single mode operation at high peak powers was demon-
strated [3], and photodegradation processes were identi-
ﬁed [4]. Recently, we reported on microscopic dye lasers,
in which the active molecules were embedded in crystal-
lographically deﬁned nanometer size pores of molecular
sieves [5]. In the past, such nanoporous materials, e.g. ze-
olites, proved to be pertinent especially to the catalysis
in oil reﬁning and petrochemistry, where they are used
in huge amounts. It is only recently that applications of
this class of porous crystalline material are discussed in
an optical context. In fact, molecular sieves can be used
to host a wide variety of optically relevant guests, such
as atoms, ions, or molecules [6]. Sieves with tubular or
channel pores, in particular, can act as an ordering frame-
work for guest molecules [7]. For optical applications it
is possible to exploit thus distinct spatial symmetries in
the arrangement of organic molecules, enhancing so, for
example, the second order nonlinear susceptibility of the
compound [8], or admitting anisotropic F¨orster energy

[12] or dye lasers [5]. In the following we report about
the novel emission properties of hexagonal monolithic mi-

sieve microcrystals, and the photostability of these sys-
tems.

dye-loaded AlPO4-5 crystals; the rod-shaped crystals con-
tain ca. 0.1 wt-% or 260 pyridine 2 molecules per unit cell,
while the barrel-shaped ones (shown in the inset) enclose rho-
damine BE50 (ca. 0.5 wt-% or 75 molecules per unit cell).
Only the polarization component parallel to the optical tran-
sition moment of the molecules is absorbed. In the rod-shaped
crystal the pyridine 2 dyes are completely aligned, whereas
with the rhodamine BE50 dye in the barrel-shaped crystals we
observe only a weak dependence of the color upon the inci-
dent polarization. Left: incident light horizontally polarized;
Right: incident light vertically polarized.

2.1 Host crystal

Molecular sieve materials are characterized by a crystallo-
graphically deﬁned framework of regularly arranged pores.
In table 1 we list some sieves, which, owing to their large
diameters of channel pores, are suitable for hosting opti-
cally eﬀectual organic molecules. Among the listed mate-
rials especially the aluminophosphate AlPO4-5 (molecular
mass 1463.4 g/mol) can be synthesized with good optical
transparency and low internal scattering losses. Its chan-
nel pores exhibit a diameter of 0.73 nm, which is large
enough to accomodate suitable organic dye molecules.

AlPO4-5–crystals are crystallized from aqueous or al-
coholic solutions under hydrothermal conditions, with the
addition of an organic structurizing agent, called template.
The template, tri-n-propylamine in our case, is necessary
to direct the synthesis towards the desired structure. The
preferred pH range for the synthesis is mildly acidic to
mildly basic. The most utilized source of phosphore is
orthophosphoric acid, and the most studied sources of
aluminum are pseudoboehmite and alkoxides [14]. Single
crystals with nearly perfect morphology were grown using
hydroﬂuoric acid [15]. With a specially prepared and aged
aluminum hydroxide gel crystal sizes around 1 mm in c-
axis direction were obtained [16], whereas microwave heat-
ing proved to increase the crystallization rates by more
than one order of magnitude [15,17].

Pure AlPO4-5 crystals are optically transparent from
below 400 nm to above 800 nm (n500 nm = 1.466), and af-
ter removing the template (usually by heating/calcinating)
they exhibit practically no birefringent properties. X-ray
patterns revealed systematic absences which are consis-
tent with space group P 6
m cc as well as P6cc, whereby,
however, the latter implies a polar nature of AlPO4-5 sin-
gle crystals: In fact, the 4 in the formula is the result of the
strict alternation of Al and P in the tetrahedral nodes of
the framework, which prevents the corner-sharing oxygen
tetrahedra to occur with odd numbers, and which leads
to an alternating stacking of Al and P in the direction of
the channels (c-axis). This is assumed to cause the crys-
tallographic polar nature [18] of the framework [19]. The
macroscopic polar nature of AlPO4-5 single crystals has
been proven recently in scanning pyroelectric microscopy
investigations [20]. There it was also observed that AlPO4-
5 crystals are usually twinned. The murky stripes inside
the pyridine 2-loaded crystals shown in Fig. 1 and their
slightly bowed side faces could well be a result of this kind
of twinning. It is not clear, however, to what extent such
twinning should aﬀect the optical properties relevant for
the eﬀects discussed here.

with lasing properties.

2.2 AlPO4-5/pyridine 2 compound

The compounds were synthesized following a procedure in
which the dye 1-ethyl-4-(4-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-
butadienyl)-pyridinium perchlorate (cf. Fig. 2) (pyridine 2
[21]) is added to the template or to the aluminum hydrox-
ide suspension [22,23,24]. After 1 h of hydrothermal syn-
thesis dark red crystals with a length of up to 100 µm

were obtained. The crystals were reﬂuxed in ethanol for
4 h whithout any detectable extraction of dye. The slim,
linear dye molecules ﬁt snugly into the 0.73 nm wide chan-
nel pores of the nanoporous AlPO4-5 host, resulting so in
an ordered compound material, in which the dye molecules
are all aligned along the crystal c-axis. As a consequence
the compound exhibits strong dichroism, and the emit-
ted ﬂuorescence light is polarized parallel to the c-axis.
This is documented in Fig. 1. It is also observed that with

the inclusion of pyridine 2 the entire compound acquired
pyroelectric properties and an optical second order sus-
ceptibility [5].

Depending on the dye content diﬀerent morphologies
of crystals are observed. Regular hexagonal crystals with
a rodlike form, as e.g. the ones shown in Fig. 1, were ob-
tained when the dye content was low, around 0.1 wt%
or 260 molecules per unit cell. At higher concentrations
the dye accumulated in the middle of the crystal, and
the morphology was severely disturbed. At dye content
' 0.2 wt% crystals with a caracteristic fascicular shape
resulted; cf. Fig 3. Given the small size of the crystals we
had to determine the dye content by chemically dissolv-
ing them. With this method, however, it was not possi-
ble to accurately determine the spatial distribution of the
dye. We therefore evaluated the content qualitatively by
comparing the depth of the color. It was only with these
fascicled pyridine 2-loaded crystals that we observed laser
emission. Apparently the low concentration of dye in the
undisturbed rod-shaped crystals did not spoil the growth
but on the one hand was not suﬃcient to provide the nec-
essary optical gain for compensating all losses.

2.3 AlPO4-5/rhodamine BE50 compound

The synthesis gel was prepared according to recipes [18,
25] modiﬁed for the purpose of crystallization inclusion of
dyes [26]. To a suspension of 61.6 mmol Al2O3 (8.44 g;
Pural SB, Condea Chemie) as aluminum source and 75 g
deionized water, 61.6 mmol P2O5 (14.20 g phosphoric
acid; 85 wt%, p.a. Merck) in 11.3 g deionized water was
added under mechanical stirring. After 5 min a uniform
gel formed and then 92.4 mmol tripropylamine (13.25 g
Prop3N, Merck) was added slowly. Subsequently, the ap-
propriate amount (0.1–10 mmol) of the dye powder was
mixed with the gel. The new derivative rhodamine BE50
(ethanaminium, N -[6-(diethylamino)-9-[2-(N, N -dimethyl-
3-amino-1-propoxycarbonyl)phenyl]-3H-xanthen-3-ylidene]-
N -ethyl-chloride; cf. Fig. 4) was synthesized by esteri-
ﬁcation of rhodamine B (Rh B) with 3-dimethylamino-
1-propanol [27]. It was shown that the concentration of
rhodamine BE50 (Rh BE50) achievable by crystallization
inclusion in AlPO4-5 exceeds the possible Rh B concentra-
tion by a factor of 3–4. This was attributed to the diﬀerent
molecule structures, i.e., to the zwitterionic nature of Rh B
on one hand, and to the additional positive charge of a pro-
tonated aliphatic amino group of Rh BE50 on the other
hand [27]. The latter molecules with the localized positive
charge are more compatible with the AlPO4-5 framework

dye molecules per unit cell.

than the delocalized charge of Rh B. As a consequence we
observe that at the same dye concentration Rh BE50 in-
clusion leads to a better crystal morphology than Rh B in-
clusion [28]. The synthesis of the Rh BE50/AlPO4-5 crys-
tals was performed by microwave heating [29], which has
proven to be superior in respect to avoiding damage of
sensitive dyes like coumarines [11] as well as in reducing
the time of synthesis [27].

Unlike the pyridine 2 molecules, which with a diam-
eter of 0.6 nm ﬁt into the 0.73 nm wide pores of the
AlPO4-5 host, the Rh BE50 molecules with dimension
1.36 nm2 must be accomodated in defect sites
of 0.91
(mesopores) of the host crystal. Remarkably, up to con-
centrations of 1 molecule per 75 unit cells this remains
without any visible negative consequences for the crystal
morphology, as is documented in Fig. 5.

×

In Fig. 1 the dichroic properties of the compound are
illustrated. In comparison with the pyridine-2/AlPO4-5
compound, the dichroism of the Rh BE50 compound is
reduced and the ﬂuorescence emission is partially polar-
ized. Thus it is inferred that the anisotropy of the host
structure does not fully carry through the mesopores, and
thus the guest molecules are only weakly aligned.

3 Microresonator structure

As is visible in Fig. 1 – and as the polarization of the
emitted ﬂuorescence of the compounds indicates – the ab-
sorption, as well as the emission dipole moment of the
included dyes are oriented preferentially along the crystal

c-axis (Complete orientation in the pyridine 2/AlPO4-5
compound). As dipole emission along the dipole-axis is not
possible, the emission parallel to a plane perpendicular to
the prevailing dipole orientation (i.e. the hexagonal axis)
is enhanced. Here a bundle of emission directions meets
the condition for total internal reﬂection (TIR) at the
hexagonal side faces inside the crystal. In a whispering-
gallery-mode-like way the corresponding emission can cir-
culate suﬃciently often to accumulate the gain required
to overcome the lasing threshold; cf. Fig. 6 in which this
intuitive model is illustrated for a particular ray bundle of
high symmetry. However, with resonator sizes in the or-
der of a few wavelengths, as discussed here, the ray picture
does not represent the ﬁeld modes even in a qualitatively
correct way. E.g. the ray picture insinuates a mode con-
centration in the center of the faces and ﬁeld-free corners.
However, this is not consistent with the experimental evi-
dence, which clearly shows that the emission occurs at the
corners; cf. Fig. 13. In fact, for dielectric resonator struc-
tures a few wavelengths large with TIR ﬁeld conﬁnement
a wave model has to be worked out.

3.1 Ray picture

The main feature that distinguishes the hexagonal res-
onator from other common whispering-gallery type cavi-
ties such as microdroplets [30] or semiconductor disk lasers
[31,32], is that the latter do not exhibit sharp corners
and ﬂat sides. Portions of the boundary in convex res-
onators can act as focussing or defocussing elements, but
the straight sides of a hexagon are neither one nor the
other. The hexagon in fact constitutes a self-assembled
realization of a pseudointegrable resonator [33]: For a poly-
gon with precisely 120◦ angles between adjacent sides, any
ray lauched at some angle to the surface will go through
only a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent orientations [34], just as
in the more familiar rectangular resonator where there are
at most two non-parallel orientations for any ray path.
In the hexagon, a ray encounters the interface with at
most three diﬀerent angles of incidence. Despite this ap-
parent simplicity, there exists no orthogonal coordinate
system in which the wave equation for the hexagonal cav-
ity can be solved by separation of variables. This prop-
erty of non-integrability is shared by wave equations whose
classical (short-wavelength) limit exhibits chaos. However,
ray paths in the hexagon display a degree of complex-
ity that cannot be classiﬁed as chaotic, and hence the
term pseudointegrability has been coined for these sys-
tems. The ray-wave duality in “billiards” of this type has
to be addressed in order to explain how they can support
whispering-gallery modes that emit at the corners.

In order to characterize the sample size, one can spec-
ify either the radius R of the hexagon at the corner points
or – more conveniently – the width over ﬂats (WoF) sat-
isfying the relation R = W oF/√3. The closed ray path
underlying Fig. 6 is only one member of an inﬁnite family
of periodic orbits of the hexagon billiard that all have the
same length, L = 3
W oF , as shown in Fig. 7. Long-
lived cavity modes should be expected only if the corre-

reﬂection, sin χ > 1/n = 0.69. In the case of rays impinging on
the corners (rightmost picture) the ray picture breaks down.

sponding rays satisfy the condition of TIR at the interface,
sin χ > 1/n, where χ is the angle of incidence with respect
to the surface normal. This is true for the orbits of Fig. 7.
In a naive ray approach one would furthermore obtain
the spectrum of modes by requiring an integer number
of half wavelengths to ﬁt into L, leading to constructive
interference on a round-trip. As we shall see shortly, this
estimate is justiﬁed, even though a proper treatment of
the ray-wave connection has to take into account that any
given mode is in fact made up of a whole family of diﬀer-
ent ray paths. The ultimate breakdown of the ray model,
however, is illustrated in Fig. 7 by the degenerate ray orbit
hitting the corners where the classical laws of refraction
and reﬂection become undeﬁned.

3.2 Wave picture: spectral properties

Because the hexagonal faces are neither focussing nor de-
focussing, there is no obvious way of determining the weight
that should be given to individual members of a ray family
as depicted in Fig. 7, in order to predict the spatial struc-
ture of the resulting mode. Full solutions of Maxwell’s
equations have therefore been carried out for the TM po-
larized modes of a dielectric hexagonal prism, using meth-
ods previously applied in [31,32]. In anticipation of the ex-
perimental spectra to be discussed in section 4, attention
here is focused on three diﬀerent sample sizes, with WoF
4.5 µm, 7.5 µm and 22 µm. The aim is to understand the
observed laser line spacings and the emission directional-
ity. Comparison of the calculated and observed linewidths
will not be attempted because the simulations do not take
gain-narrowing into account.

In order ﬁrst to verify that orbits of the type shown
in Fig. 7 determine the characteristic mode spacing of
these cavities, Fig. 8 shows light scattering spectra for
diﬀerent sample sizes in the vicinity of the experimen-
tal wavelengths. Intensity is plotted versus dimensionless
wavenumber kR, where k = 2π/λ. This is the natural scale
for comparison with semiclassical predictions because modes
diﬀering by one node along a closed path should then be
equally spaced, with a characteristic separation ∆(kR)c =
2π R/(n L) = 2π/(3√3n) = 0.825 independent of the sam-
ple size. The expected wavelength spacing of the modes
(free spectral range F SR) is ∆λ = λ2

ries of resonant features with approximately the predicted
wavevector spacing.

Each of the peaks marked in Fig. 8 (b) is in fact a
multiplet, which is not resolved because the splittings of
the individual modes comprising the multiplet are smaller
than their passive linewidths. There is evidence for this
because several of the peaks are very asymmetric and in
particular exhibit a steep slope on one side. For an isolated
resonance, the most general lineshape that could arise is
the Fano function (of which the Lorentzian is a special
case), which however does not yield satisfactory ﬁts here.
To further expose the multiplet structure, we modeled
deviations from the ideal hexagonal shape which could
lead to narrower individual linewidths and increase the
multiplet splitting. Shape perturbations were chosen that
preserve the D6h point group symmetry and hence remove
only “accidental” quasi-degeneracies. The actual pertur-
bation that is present in the samples of Figs. 11 and 12
eluded experimental characterization, so that a model cal-
culation can reproduce only generic features which are in-
sensitive to the precise type of perturbation. One such fea-

ture is the average mode spacing after degeneracies have
been lifted suﬃciently.

us to identify two distinct series of modes with caracter-

their scale is smaller than λ. A qualitatively diﬀerent spec-

3.3 Wave picture: intensity proﬁle

There is one class of quasi-degeneracies that is not re-
moved by any of the perturbations in Fig. 9: their physical
origin is time-reversal symmetry for the ray motion inside
the cavity. Any of the periodic orbits in Fig. 7 can be tra-
versed either clockwise or counterclockwise, and the same
holds for more general ray paths. The diﬀerent propaga-
tion directions can be linearly combined in various ways
to obtain nearly-degenerate standing-wave patterns that
diﬀer only in their parity with respect to some of the crys-
tal’s reﬂection axes. A minute splitting does exist because
the non-integrability of the ray motion implies that the
propagation direction itself is not a “good quantum num-
ber”, i.e. reversals of the sense of rotation are unlikely but
not impossible in the wave equation. This is analogous
to quantum tunneling and hence leads only to exponen-
tially small splittings that can be neglected on the scale of
the individual resonance linewidths [36]. These multiplets
have been counted as one resonance in Eq. (1).

Following this reasoning, in Fig. 10 the traveling-wave
patterns belonging to one of the resonances in Fig. 8 (a)
and (b), respectively, is plotted. High-intensity ridges in-
side the resonator form a whispering-gallery-like pattern
that decays from the interface into the cavity center. The
number of ridges in the radial direction (perpendicular
to a side face) provides an approximate analogue of a
transverse mode order, however upon closer examination
one sees that the number of ridges and nodal lines is not
uniquely deﬁned, in particular along a diameter joining
opposite corners. The modes can therefore not be prop-
erly labeled by “good quantum numbers” characterizing
the number of radial and azimuthal nodes – this is a direct
consequence of the nonintegrability of the problem. The
most signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the whispering-gallery modes
of a circular cavity is clearly the anisotropic emission. High
intensity is seen to emanate predominantly from the cor-
ners and is directed almost parallel to an adjacent crystal
facet. The overall emission pattern is very similar in both
modes despite the large diﬀerence in size (or kR) between
the two hexagons.

width is δ(kR) = 0.10 in (a) and δ(kR) = 0.04 in (b).

ularly shaped crystals shifted from 645 nm to 665 nm;
cf. Fig. 11a. In none of these rod-shaped crystals laser
emission was observed. However, narrow laser emission
peaks (observed linewidth of 0.3 nm given by spectrome-
ter resolution) occured in most fascicled samples. Emission
maxima in these fascicled samples were observed at wave-
lenghts up to 695 nm, and again, increasing dye concen-
tration correlated with increasing redshift (cf. Figs. 11b
and c). As already mentioned, together with increasing
dye content we also notice an increasingly disarranged
crystal morphology. The observed facts, disturbed mor-
phology and red-shifted emission spectrum are consistent
with the hypothesis of a host-guest interaction which in-
creases with dye content. Essentially both, the pyridine
2 molecules and the AlPO4-5 framework carry a static
dipole moment [18,19]. Obviously the buildup of electro-
static energy in the crystal lattice has to be compensated
by an increasing amount of stacking faults. On the other
side, the mechanism of the redshift is not unequivocally
identiﬁed, yet, but is probably related to the one discussed
in [37,38].

The dye concentration in the rhodamine BE50-loaded
AlPO4-5 samples was around 75 unit cells per dye molecule,
corresponding to 0.5 wt%. Also with these samples the
same correlation between the emission wavelength and dye
concentration was observed; cf. also [27]. In contrast to the
pyridine 2-loaded samples, the ﬂuorescence emission was
not completely polarized. The observed polarization con-
was around 10%, indicating that in the
trast cp =
average the Rh BE50 molecules are only weakly aligned
parallel to the crystal c-axis.

Figure 12. Lasing spectrum of a rhodamine BE50-loaded
AlPO4-5 microcrystal with a concentration around 75 unit cells
per dye molecule and size of 7.5 µm width over ﬂats.

Independent of the type of loading, in most micro-
crystals with W oF ' 8 µm lasing was observed to occur
on several sharp lines with instrument resolution limited
width. A typical example is represented in Fig. 12. Note
that the lines are not equally spaced. In fact, the free
spectral range (F SR) of 11 nm corresponding to the res-
onator size is far above the observed line spacing of 3.2,
4.3 and 3.4 nm. This is in agreement with the theoreti-
cal model of paragraph 3.2, in which the average lasing
mode spacing (after lifting the quasi-degeneracies in the
ideal hexagon) was estimated to be ∆λ = 3.6 nm. Also
in agreement with the theoretical discussion are the emis-
sion regions where the laser light leaves the hexagonal res-
onators. Figure 13(left) shows the laser emission as bright
spots. Clearly the emission is concentrated along the crys-
tal edges. The complex emission distribution is compatible
with the simultaneously recorded spectrum (cf. Fig. 12)
which reveals multimode emission.

On the other hand, samples with smaller resonator
(W oF ' 4 µm), as e.g. the one shown in Fig. 11b emitted
one single laser line. Therefore the emission is unadul-
terated by hole burning induced multimode beating and
interference, and appears in the simple pattern shown in
Fig 13(right), where two ca. 1 µm-spots (
microscope
resolution limit) mark the region of laser emission, which,
again, is located on the crystal edges. Compared with
larger samples, the ratio of the line peak to the underlying
ﬂuorescence shoulder of these small lasers is an order of
magnitude higher (cf. Fig. 14).

While, as described above, the average linespacing of
3.6 nm observed in the sample of Fig. 12 is not compat-
ible with the free spectral range of ∆λ = 12 nm of the
corresponding resonator, the 4.2 nm spacing of the 3 dom-
inant peaks in the sample shown in Fig. 11c is in accord
with the F SR resulting from the 22-µm-WoF hexagonal
resonator. The theoretical model for the 22 µm-WoF sam-
ple (cf. Eq. (1)) yields an average mode spacing of ∆λ
≈
0.5 nm which is close to the spectrometer resolution. This
high spectral density helps to explain the large background
in the lasing spectrum of Fig. 11: It appears likely that
not all the individual lasing modes in this sample were re-

emission originates from regions along side edges. Left: rho-

solved, and hence part of the shoulder on which the three
peaks of curve c sit is probably made up of other lasing
modes. Any microcavity eﬀects such as enhanced β fac-
tor (spontaneaous emission enhancement and suppression
[39]) are also suppressed by the larger density of modes in
the large sample.

Figure 14 illustrates the diﬀerential eﬃciency behav-
ior of a typical microlaser with W oF < 10 µm and one
with W oF > 10 µm. Lasing threshold for the latter size
samples was around 0.5 MW/cm2, regardless of the type
of dye loading. On the other side, crystals of smaller size
(W oF = 4.5 µm) from the same synthesis batch revealed
a considerably smaller threshold (0.12 MW/cm2) and a
factor of > 7 larger diﬀerential gain. Wether this is a con-
sequence of quantum size eﬀects [39] will be clariﬁed in
progressing studies.

It is informative to compare the threshold of molecu-
lar sieve microlasers with vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers (VCSELs). VCSELs with a size comparable to sam-
ple b in Fig. 11 exhibit threshold currents of ca. 1 mA,
1015 s−1 electrons. On the

(cf. Fig. 13) corresponds to a current of 1.4
532-nm-photons, or a factor of 2.24 over the electron rate.
As the pump radiation is not polarized but the molecu-
lar ensemble of the considered laser is aligned, only half
of the pump photons actually contribute to the inversion.
Thus, in terms of elementary (quantum) pump processes
needed to reach lasing threshold the molecular sieve lasers
are comparable to VCSELs.

5 Photostability

Photostability is a critical issue with dye lasers. We in-
vestigated samples exhibiting an undisturbed morphol-
ogy, similar to the one shown in Fig. 1. The pyridine 2-
loaded samples were irradiated with 10 Hz trains of 10 ns

ical AlPO4-5/dye compounds. Shown is the peak of the laser

pulses of the 532 nm second harmonic of a Nd:YAG-laser
and a power density of 5 MW/cm2. Figure 15 illustrates
the dwindle of ﬂuorescence activity of a pyridine 2-loaded
AlPO4-5 sample under such bleaching irradiation. After a
bleaching period of 140 seconds the exposure was inter-
rupted for 18 minutes. Then the bleaching procedure was
resumed. Apparently the ﬂuorescence recovers during the
intermission. If it is assumed that bleaching consists in
breaking bonds of the dye molecules, then bond energies
in the eV-range have to be considered. Even if the dye de-
bris might remain encaged in their pores, spontaneous or
thermally activated self healing of broken eV-bonds seems
not very probable. One can therefore suppose that the re-
covery is due to diﬀusion of new, intact dye molecules into
the bleached volume. Considering the stereometrically re-
stricted possibilities inside the molecular sieve framework
together with diﬀusion distances of several µm and the
observed recovery time in the range of minutes, diﬀusion
is more plausible than self healing.

As bleaching reduces the concentration of dye, a blue-
shift of the ﬂuorescence is expected with increasing photo-
bleaching [18,19]. However, the 656-nm-ﬂuorescence emis-
sion maximum of this sample is already at the shortest ob-
served wavelength (cf. Fig. 11), corresponding to a low dye
concentration, and consequently, to weak dipole interac-
tions. Thus, the blueshift under these circumstances must
be rather small. This explains the fact that we could not
detect a measurable blueshift with these pyridine 2-loaded
samples.

On the other hand, the rhodamine BE50-loaded sam-
ples under investigation contained dye at a concentra-
tion of around one Rh BE50 molecule per 75 unit cells,
and therefore bleaching caused a detectable 4 nm shift
of the ﬂuorescence towards the blue (bleach irradiance
0.5 MW/cm2). Observing the laser emission spectrum while
bleaching the samples, a further consequence of the blueshift
was revealed: Blueshift of the ﬂuorescence reduces the

6 Conclusion

≈

We have reported about a new form of microlasers based
on nanoporous molecular sieves containing embedded dyes.
Size- and shape-dependent laser properties were observed,
in agreement with theoretical predictions: Larger hexago-
nal crystals (W oF ' 10 µm) revealed multiline laser emis-
5 µm) oscillate on
sion, while the smaller ones (W oF
one single line. The laser threshold power density of these
small lasers is approximately a factor of 3 lower than the
threshold of W oF
10 µm–lasers, and their diﬀerential
eﬃciency is almost an order of magnitude larger. Although
these properties did not depend on the type of embed-
ded dye molecules, the photostability seems to be aﬀected
by the size of the molecules. Molecules which ﬁt into the
pores, such as pyridine 2, keep the ability to diﬀuse in the
pore framework of the molecular sieve. Therefore photo-
bleached molecules can be replaced by intact ones diﬀusing
into the luminescing volume.

overlap of the ﬂuorescence band with the absorption spec-
trum, and as a result laser modes at lower wavelengths will
suﬀer less losses with increasing bleaching. This is doc-
umented in Fig. 16, where the intensity of mode b with
the shortest oscillating wavelength increases, while longer-
wavelength-modes a and c decrease during the bleach pro-
cedure. At the same time a 0.2 nm blueshift of the oscilla-
tion wavelength was detected. We attribute this to a weak
decrease of the refractive index of the resonator material
due to the smaller polarizability of the dye debris. In con-
trast to the pyridine 2 samples, however, recovery of the
ﬂuorescence was not detected. As the Rh 50BE molecules
are considerably larger than pyridine 2 molecules their
mobility in the molecular sieve framework is severly ham-
pered. So, diﬀusion of intact molecules into the bleached
volume occurs – if ever – on larger timescales than min-
utes.

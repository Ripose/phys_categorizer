We present in this paper results on a new dissemination system of ultra-stable referene signal

at 100 MHz on a standard (cid:28)bre network. The 100 MHz signal is simply transferred by amplitude

modulation of an optial arrier. Two di(cid:27)erent approahes for ompensating the noise introdued

by the link have been implemented. The limits of the two systems are analyzed and several solution

suggested in order to improve the frequeny stability and to further extend the distribution dis-

tane. Nevertheless, our system is a good tool for the best old atom fountains omparison between

−14

laboratories, up to 100 km, with a relative frequeny resolution of 10

at one seond integration

−17

time and 10

for one day of measurement. The distribution system may be upgraded to ful(cid:28)ll the

stringent distribution requirements for the future optial loks.

II. PRINCIPLE AND OBJECTIVE

The goal of the dissemination is the distribution of a

referene signal at a frequeny of 100 MHz, synthesized

from a frequeny standard, by amplitude modulation

of an optial arrier, without degradation of the phase

noise of the distributed signal. The referene signal

modulates the bias urrent of a DFB laser diode, at

1.55 µm, whih is transmitted through a (cid:28)bre optial

link to users. At the link extremity, a photodiode

detets the amplitude modulation and onverts the

optial signal to a radio-frequeny signal osillating at

where τ is the propagation delay in the optial

In the fol-

The output signal must be phase oherent with the

referene soure of frequeny ωref

and on average of

emitted signal must be equal to the opposite of the

phase perturbation φp . Consequently, on average (or
for time muh longer than τ ) the phase of the input
signal, φinput

is improved by using a voltage ontrolled quartz osil-

lator (VCXO), as a phase shifter, delivering a signal at

the referene frequeny with a stable amplitude. The

VCXO presents thus the advantage to orret all phase

perturbation in the orretion bandwidth of the phase

ompensator, whih is limited by the round-trip prop-

agation delay in the optial link (about 0.3 ms in the

ase of the 43-km LNE-SYRTE to LPL optial link).

The 100 MHz output signal of the VCXO modulates

the bias urrent of the DFB laser diode. The optial

signal is launhed in the optial (cid:28)bre link to the user.

At the user end, a simple system allows detetion and

regeneration of the bakward signal. The deteted sig-

Abstract

We suggest a geometrical framework to discuss the action of slabs of negatively
refracting materials. We show that these slabs generate the same orbits as normal
materials, but traced out in opposite directions. This property allows us to conﬁrm
that the action of any lossless multilayer can be optically cancelled by putting it
together with the multilayer constructed as the inverted mirror image, with ǫ and
µ reversed in sign.

Key words: Negative refraction; Left-handed media

In the last years the notion of materials with both negative electrical permit-
tivity ǫ and magnetic permeability µ is at the center of a lively and sometimes
heated debate. This idea dates back to 1968, when Veselago [1] theoretically
predicted that these remarkable materials would exhibit a number of unusual
eﬀects derived from the fact that in them the vectors (k, E, H) of a plane wave
form a left-handed (LH) rather than a right-handed (RH) set. For this reason,
he called them LH media.

The ﬁrst feasible implementation of such materials was suggested by Pendry [2,3],
who also made the provocative (and criticized) prediction that they can also
act as a perfect lens [4]. Inspired by these ideas, Smith et al [5] constructed
an artiﬁcial medium (consisting of microstructured arrays of small metallic
wires and split ring resonators) with the desired properties in the microwave
regime. Since then, new samples have been prepared [6,7] and several potential
future applications have been speculated [8]. To prevent the signiﬁcant losses
of these metamaterials, Notomi [9] suggested that identical behaviors could
be expected to occur in lossless photonic crystals. Many researchers are now
exploring this interesting possibility [10,11,12].

One of the most interesting properties of these LH materials is a negative re-
fraction at the interface with a RH medium. Although this has been challenged

by some authors [13,14], the seminal work of Shelby, Smith and Schultz [15],
as well as other subsequent experiments using diﬀerent systems [16,17], have
dispelled any doubt regarding the reality of negative refraction.

Most of the work reported in the recent literature has been focused on the
behavior of the evanescent components. The emphasis on the near-ﬁeld limit
comes from the interest that these media evoke as perfect lenses to transfer
images. In this Letter we adopt a diﬀerent and simpler strategy and center
our attention in the far-ﬁeld, much in the standard transfer-matrix formalism
employed when dealing with multilayers [18]. As we have recently put for-
ward [19,20], the action of the system can be conveniently viewed as a bilinear
transformation on the unit disk. This geometrical setting allows us to charac-
terize the slabs by the associated orbits. It turns out that these orbits are the
same for LH and RH materials, but they are traced out in opposite directions.
This leads to an intuitive understanding of an intriguing result obtained by
Pendry and Ramakrishna [21] and rederived recently by Ruppin [22]: a LH
slab cancels an identical RH slab. Furthermore, a much wider class of cancel-
lation will be conﬁrmed using our approach. We stress that the transfer matrix
solely relies on the linearity of the wave equation, so that our treatment ap-
plies to any kind of waves and can seed light into ﬁelds where the notion of
bandgap materials is becoming more and more important, such as sound or
water waves [23].

We start by considering the simple example of a plane parallel slab of thick-
ness d1 and refractive index n1, surrounded by two semi-inﬁnite identical media
(ambient, a, and substrate, s, respectively) of refractive index n0. For simplic-
ity, all the media are assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic and lossless.

A monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave falls from the ambient making
an angle θ0 with the normal to the ﬁrst interface and with an amplitude E(+)
.
We consider as well another plane wave of the same frequency and polarization,
and with amplitude E(−)
, incident from the substrate at the same angle θ0.
The output ﬁelds in the ambient and the substrate will be denoted E(−)
and
E(+)

complex plane C, mapping the point zs into the point za, according to

za =

b∗ + a∗zs
a + b zs

,

(8)

where a = 1/TRH and b = (RRH/TRH)∗. The matrix element b is always
a imaginary number for a symmetric system (i.e., a system for which the
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients are the same whether light is incident
on one side or on the opposite side). Equation (8) is a bilinear (or M¨obius)
transformation and one can check that the unit disk remains invariant under
the slab action [19]. Henceforth we assume that no light strikes from the
substrate and then we have zs = 0 and za = RRH.

For this slab [Tr(MRH)]2 < 4 and the action in the unit disk leaves only one
point invariant (ﬁxed point) [25]. To picture how zs transforms into za the
concept of orbit is especially appropriate. Given the point zs, its orbit is the
set of points z′ obtained from zs by the action of the family of matrices rep-
resenting a slab. This family can be generated, e.g., by varying continuously
the thickness. One can then show that the orbits obtained are always (hyper-
bolic) circumferences centered at the ﬁxed point and passing through the point
zs = 0. In Fig. 1 we have plotted a typical orbit as well as the transformed of
the point zs = 0 for a slab of phase thickness of β1 = 0.8750π rad.

Let us consider the same slab, but of a LH medium, with negative refractive
index −n1. The same arguments used to assume a negative index lead to the
conclusion that a positive wave impedance; i. e., Z = qµ/ǫ, is the correct
choice. This translates into the fact that the Fresnel equations remain valid
provided the absolute values of ǫ and µ are used. On the other hand, it is well
conﬁrmed that the phase velocity is oppositely directed to the energy ﬂow in

pair of complementary media, each cancelling the eﬀect of the other.

these media.

All this together means that the interface matrices Iij are the same as for the
corresponding RH slab, while the layer matrices become complex conjugate.
In other words, the matrix MLH for this slab is

MLH = I01L∗

I10 = M∗

RH = M−1
RH.

(9)

From this apparently innocuous formula, one can draw several nontrivial and
interesting conclusions. First, we note that if we plug the matrix elements of
MLH in the bilinear action (8), the ﬁxed point is the same, but the orbit is
traced out in opposite direction. Therefore, in this geometrical picture, LH and
RH materials have identical orbits, although for the former they are clockwise,
while for the latter they are counterclockwise.

Let us now put together these RH and LH slabs. The resulting system is
described by the product of the transfer matrices MRH and MLH, which, by
virtue of Eq. (9), is precisely the identity. In consequence, we get a perfect
antireﬂector with no phase change in transmission. This is quite intuitive from
our unit-disk picture: the action of the global system consists of two successive
identical rotations in opposite directions that cancel out.

Alternatively, one can look at this problem by using the usual and intuitive
method of adding multiply reﬂected and transmitted waves. Since in the in-
terface between both slabs there is no reﬂected wave, the scheme of the energy
ﬂow is as indicated in Fig. 2. If we take the incident ﬁeld of unit amplitude,
the overall reﬂected ﬁeld is

r01 + t01t10(r10 + r3

10 + r5

10 + . . .) = 0,

while the overall transmitted ﬁeld is

t01t10(1 + r2

10 + r4

10 + . . .) = 1,

which conﬁrms the previous result.

The discussion so far admits a straightforward generalization for any multi-
layer. Indeed, let Mas denote the transfer matrix of a system consisting of an
arbitrary number of layers (some of them made of RH materials and some of
LH materials), which can be constructed by a direct extension of (2). One can
show that

Mas =

with |Ras|2 +|Tas|2 = 1. Now we take the multilayer in the reverse order, which
is represented by

Next we switch every RH layer to an identical LH layer and viceversa. The
ﬁnal system is thus described by M∗

sa, and one can check that [20]

M∗

sa = M−1
as .

In consequence, when both multilayers are put together they give the identity.
This formalizes in a diﬀerent framework the notion of “complementary media”
introduced by Pendry and Ramakrishna [21]: any medium can be optically can-
celled by an equal thickness of material constructed to be an inverted mirror
image of the medium, with ǫ and µ reversed in sign. That is, complementary
media cancel one another and become invisible (i.e., a perfect antireﬂector).

In summary, we have demonstrated another curious property of LH materials,
which may be experimentally tested with the state of the art in this hot area
of research . Although these results could have practical consequences, in our
view they provide the ﬁrst feasible implementation of how to build the inverse
of a transfer matrix.

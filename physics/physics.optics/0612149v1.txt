Optical echo in photonic crystals

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The dynamics of photonic wavepacket in the eﬀective oscillator potential is studied. The oscillator
potential is constructed on a base of one dimensional photonic crystal with a period of unit cell
adiabatically varied in space. The structure has a locally equidistant discrete spectrum. This leads
to an echo eﬀect, i.e. the periodical reconstruction of the packet shape. The eﬀect can be observed
in a nonlinear response of the system. Numerical estimations for porous-silicon based structures are
presented for femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser pump.

One of the strongest driving forces of the modern op-
tics is a projection of the solid-state physics concepts on a
photonic language. Except the fundamental interest, this
is related to so-called photonics: a construction of optical
based elements of information processing devices. Mod-
ern technology provides an opportunity to construct a
photonic devices of a sunmicron and micron sizes. In par-
ticular it is worth mentioning photonic crystals1,2, struc-
tures with a periodic modulation of optical properties.
They act on a photon the same way as a crystal lattice
potential on electrons. Beauty optical analogs of several
solid-state phenomena have been observed in systems,
based on photonic crystals. One could mention Bloch
oscillations3,4, optical analog of Franz-Keldysh eﬀect5,6,
fabrication of optical molecule7, etc. Optical ﬁeld local-
ization in the photonic crystal based structures provides
numerous nonlinear optical phenomena8,9.

A description of experimental results in this ﬁeld com-
monly uses spectral(plane-wave) representation. At the
same time, modern femtosecond lasers provide pulses of
a small longitude. For example 100 f s impulse has a
30µm length in vacuum and is even shorter in a mate-
rial media. This is comparable to the size of a photonic
crystal structure. By taking into account a ﬁnite length
of the photonic wavepacket, one can predict a new range
of optical eﬀects, similar to the ones, based on electron
wavepacket spatial localization. In this paper we discuss
possible observation of the “optical echo” eﬀect, i.e. pe-
riodical reconstruction of a shape of the optical pulse in
a specially designed photonic crystal structure.

The simplest echo eﬀect can be realized for a quan-
tum particle in a harmonic oscillator potential. Let the
particle being localized at the initial moment near cer-
tain spatial point x0.
It can be characterized by the
wavefunction Ψ0(x), for example a Gaussian packet can
be considered Ψ0(x)
+ ikx(cid:17). After the
exp (cid:16)−
initial moment a space spreading of the pulse takes the
place because of the dispersion. However, after the time
equal to the period of the oscillator T , the wavepacket
will reconstruct it’s shape back.
Indeed, all the eigen-
functions of oscillator evolve with multiple frequencies
of the oscillator, so that the wavefunction of the packet

One can see from (1) that the crucial circumstance here
is that eigenlevels of the harmonic oscillator are equidis-
tant in frequency domain. On the other hand energy
levels of almost any pendulum are equally spaced in en-
ergy in the quasiclassical limit11. In this case energy split
in in neighboring levels is just 2π~
T (E) , where T (E) is a pe-
riod of oscillation at given energy. This means the echo
eﬀect can be observed for packets composed of locally
equidistant states of the discrete spectrum of almost ar-
bitrary potential. Echo eﬀects can also be observed in
more sophisticated cases, for example in the disordered
structures12. The only requirement is the local equidis-
tance of the spectrum.

Our goal is to construct an eﬀective oscillator potential
for optical pulses. This requires a modifying of dispersion
relation with respect to spatial coordinate. Fabricating a
structure with a refractive index being changed smoothly
in a wide range is a very complicated task. However,

discrete spectrum (i.e. localized eigenstates), we propose
using a photonic crystal with a unit cell period adiabat-
ically varied in space. Let us imagine that for the center
of the structure the carrier frequency of the wavepacket
lies just above the photonic bandgap. Consider the struc-
ture with a period decreasing to the spatial edges. In this
case the photonic bandgap of a crystal is higher at the
crystal edges, than in the geometric center. This means
the wavepacket is reﬂected from the Bragg mirrors near
the structure borders, therefore it becomes localized in
the whole crystal.

The one-dimensional photonic crystals based on porous
silicon are quite widespread in modern photonic technol-
ogy. The procedure for their preparation is quite sim-
ple. Such photonic crystals constitute of repeating pair
of layers of n
2.2 refraction indexes. The
≃
optical lengths of both layers in each repeating pair of
the crystal are usually taken equal, their material dis-
persion can be examined as linear. We will address to
consider such type of structures. The adiabatic variation
of the period of such crystal is also feasible technologi-

cal task. However in order to obtain suﬃcient number of
equidistant localized levels (around 10) the whole num-
ber of pairs must be taken large enough. In our model
M = 100 pairs of layers are considered.

In the eﬀective local linear susceptibility approxima-
tion all layers can be characterized by two values: dm
- the length of the layer and nm - it’s refraction index.
The ﬁeld strength of eigenmode of each layer is given by
expression:

m(x) = Ame−ikmx + Bmeikmxkm =

nm,

E

where Am and Bm are unknown amplitudes, which are
determined by frequency of eigenmode w.

There are diﬀerent ways to calculate the spectrum of
the structure. One possibility would be a direct search

of a solution of eigenvalue problem. The boundary con-
ditions on the edges of the structure and on the joints
of the layers produce a set of equations for Am, Bm for
each layer. The solvability of this set requires ﬁnding a
determinant of a 2M
2M matrix with some elements
equal to zero. This would give an equation for w. The
numerical solving of this equation produces a spectrum
of whole system.

Another possible way to ﬁnd a spectrum of the sys-
tem is to treat it as an eﬀective adiabatically varied peri-
odic potential. This method is quite similar to employing
Vl¨oke or Bloch’s theorem. It ﬁts the paradigm of apply-
ing condensed matter physics ideas on the ﬁeld of optical
problems. Let’s zoom on pair of two layers : (d, n) and
d, n′). Their overall spatial length is D. Each eigen-
(D
mode of the pair j can be presented the same way as (2):

−

Actually, The Vl¨oke theorem itself is not used, we just
use the corresponding notation. In fact, the phase χ is

determined only by the parameters of local pair of layers,
i.e.
it is solely connected with the pair number. The
expression for the value of the electric ﬁeld in the pair
number j can now be rewritten as:

The results of the calculation of the spectrum for ordi-
nary one-dimensional photonic crystal and for one with a
period variation are presented in Fig. 1,2. The localized
levels between the upper bands of photonic bandgaps at
the crystal edges and in the center of the structure are
not exactly equidistant. This means that exact recon-
struction of the form of the signal won’t occur and the
packet will irrevocably lose it’s shape after some periods.
However this fact is not crucial. Let us introduce the

“non-equidistance parameter” η = δK
∆K , where ∆K is an
eﬀective distance between levels and δk is an average de-
viation of the level interval from the ∆K. For an ideal
oscillator η = 0%, in case of ordinary photonic crystal
η = 10%, while in presence of adiabatic period variation
η = 2.5%. This means in a simple crystal the packet will
lose it’s shape approximately after 3 periods, while for
the selected structure this will happen after 10 periods.
This is enough for experimental purposes.

One can consider a possible experimental realization

sian shaped wavepacket of a period of 130 f s and the
wavelength 800 nm. These are common values for the
state of the art Ti:Sap lasers. The optical lengths of
the layers on the crystal edge are Λ
4 = 200 nm. In this
case the spectrum of the wavepacket lies inside the area
of
10 localized levels. The distribution of a signal is
calculated in accordance of Eq.(1). Fig. 3 shows the re-
sults of calculation. After the initial moment, most of the
pulse is reﬂected from the structure, because its carrier
frequency corresponds to the photonic bandgap of crys-
tal edge region. However, approximately 30% part of the
signal in terms of intensity penetrates inside the oscillator
due to the tunnelling and becomes localized. It starts a
propagation with a periodical shape reconstruction. The
localization due to the reﬂection of the wavepacket from
the eﬀective Bragg mirrors on the edges of the crystal
leads to a periodical stops and changing of direction of
the pulse propagation. The period of echo motion in thus
created optical oscillator potential is 1 ps.

Finally, let us discuss how the proposed optical echo
eﬀect can be observed in photonic crystal oscillator. One

of the ways to detect the shape reconstruction is a time-
resolved observation of the nonlinear response of the sys-
tem. Indeed, near the stop-points of the oscillatoric mo-
tion the pulse group velocity falls. Therefore, the pulse
spatial length is smaller and its electromagnetic ﬁeld is
larger near these points, as can be observed from Fig. 3.
Consequently, second or third optical harmonic response
of the structure should look like a consequence of sharp
peaks with a sub-picosecond period. This should be seen
in the autocorrelation properties of the nonlinear signal.
The third harmonic seems more perspective, as the eﬀect
in higher harmonics is more pronounced. On the other
hand, there maybe an experimental problem concerning
the absorbtion of the third-harmonic signal inside the Si-
based structure at 800 nm pump13,14. This may require
usage of the infrared pump laser (Ti-sapphire + para-
metric oscillator system).

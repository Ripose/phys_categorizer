Abstract

Particles that can be trapped in optical tweezers range from tens of microns down to tens of
nanometres in size. Interestingly, this size range includes large macromolecules. We show ex-
perimentally, in agreement with theoretical expectations, that optical tweezers can be used to
manipulate single molecules of polyethylene oxide suspended in water. The trapped molecules
accumulate without aggregating, so this provides optical control of the concentration of macro-
molecules in solution. Apart from possible applications such as the micromanipulation of
nanoparticles, nanoassembly, microchemistry, and the study of biological macromolecules, our
results also provide insight into the thermodynamics of optical tweezers.

Introduction—the Limits of Optical Trapping

While optical tweezers (Ashkin et al. 1986) are usually used for the trapping and manipulation of particles
of approximately 1–10 µm in size, both larger and smaller particles can be trapped. Since an upper limit
to the force that can be exerted by the beam is imposed by the ﬁnite momentum ﬂux of the beam, while
weight, viscous drag, and the likelihood of adhesion all continue to increase with increasing size, optical
tweezers will become unable to perform useful manipulation for sufﬁciently large particles.

For small particles, the gradient force becomes proportional to the volume, while the scattering forces be-
come proportional to the volume squared (Svoboda and Block 1994; Harada and Asakura 1996). Therefore,
a wider range of particles become trappable at small sizes, such as reﬂective particles that are pushed out
of the trap at larger sizes. Absorptive particles remain untrappable at small sizes since the absorption force
is proportional to the volume.

The lower limit is provided by Brownian motion——the Brownian motion force is 12πrηkB T where ηis the
viscosity of the ﬂuid and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. Since the viscosity of the ﬂuid will hinder escape, it
is best to compare the trapping potential—the energy required to remove the particle from the trap—with
the thermal energy kBT.

where nmed is the refractive index of the surrounding medium, m = nparticle/nmed is the relative refractive
index, c is the speed of light in free space, and I is the irradiance I, the corresponding trapping potential is

This suggests that it should be possible to trap polymer microspheres as small as 30 nm in radius with a
power as low as 100 mW available at the focus. As this size range includes single polymer macromolecules,
we carried out experiments on the optical trapping of single polyethylene oxide (PEO) molecules of differ-
ing molecular weights (Singer et al. 2006).

Experiment and Experimental Results

A typical inverted optical tweezers apparatus, with a 100× NA = 1.25 objective, was used to focus the
beam from a 1064 nm ytterbium ﬁber laser to form the trap. Up to 700 mW was available at the focus. A
sample consisting of a suspension of PEO molecules was place in the trap, and the concentration of PEO
molecules in the trap was monitored by measuring the backscattered light from a low-power (2 mW) He–
Ne laser focused onto the same position. The properties of the PEO molecules are given in tables 1 and 2.
Notably, a comparison of measured radii of gyration (Devanand and Selser 1991) with the stretched chain
lengths (Cooper et al. 1991) shows that the PEO molecules can be approximated as spheres, and that the
above theoretical considerations should apply.

The two larger sizes of PEO molecules (100 kDa and 300 kDa) could be trapped. When the molecules were
trapped the concentration of PEO molecules was observed to increase over several minutes. A typical
experimental curve is shown below in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1. Increase in concentration over time

The increase in concentration was repeatable,
reversible, and increased with increasing power
(Singer et al. 2006). We estimate that approximately 1.5 W would be required to trap the 100 kDa PEO
molecules.

Thermodynamics of Optical Tweezers

The increase in concentration takes several minutes because PEO molecules must diffuse into the region
of the trap. As the trap is initially turned on, the molecules around the edge of the trap are rapidly pulled
into the middle of the trap. This leaves a region of reduced concentration into which molecules outside the
trap will diffuse into.

In the dilute limit, the probability of ﬁnding a particle in a particular position will follow a Boltzmann
distribution. Since the ambient energy is kBT, and a particle within the trap has its energy reduced by the
trapping potential, the probability per unit volume of ﬁnding a particle within the trap is greater, and the
equilibrium concentration will be

C(r) = C0 exp(−U(r)/kBT),

where C0 is the ambient concentration and U is the trapping potential. As soon as the laser power is
sufﬁcient for the trapping potential to exceed kBT, the concentration increases very rapidly with increasing
power. This results in the appearance of sudden switching-on at a threshold power—also seen in other
systems, such as, for example, diodes in circuits, which have similar exponential behaviour.

At equilibrium, there are two opposing forces acting on the molecules: the optical gradient force, and a
force due to the gradient of the partial pressure of the molecules. At equilibrium,

where R is the universal gas constant (Einstein 1905; Einstein 1956). Before equilibrium is reached, the
imbalance between these two forces will drive diffusion of the PEO molecules. Assuming spherical sym-

metry of the trap, this reduces to a one-dimensional differential equation and can be solved using a ﬁnite-
difference time-domain method. As the times scales involved—the time over which the optical force moves
the molecules, and the time taken to diffuse into the region of the trap—are very different, the simulation
requires a very large number of time steps to show the behaviour seen in the experiments. The simulation
was carried out with a weak optical force to reduce the discrepancy between the two time scales. Results
are shown in ﬁgures 2 and 3.

Figure 3. Concentration over the trap at different times

In ﬁgure 2(a), we can see the growth in concentration over time. This is similar to the experimentally
observed behaviour in ﬁgure 1. The depletion of concentration in the outer region of the trap is shown

in 2(b). Although we could not directly observe this depletion, it clearly existed in the experiment, since
otherwise PEO molecules would not have diffused towards the trap. The rapidity of the initial depletion
compared with the slow increase back to the ambient concentration highlights the difference in the time
scales of the two processes. In order to see how the concentration changes in more detail, the concentration
was plotted as a function of position for selected times, shown by the light blue lines in ﬁgure 2(c). (Figure
2(c) is otherwise the same as ﬁgure 2(b), except with a logarithmic scale on the horizontal axis.) The plots
of the concentration versus position are shown in ﬁgure 3. The dark blue line shows the instantaneous
concentration, with the light blue line indicating the initial concentration. The magenta line shows the
proﬁle of the trapping beam, which is assumed to be Gaussian. The initial depletion due to the optical trap
concentrating the immediately available molecules in the centre of the trap can be clearly seen, followed
by a slow approach to equilibrium.

Interestingly, the edge of the optical trap functions as a one-way barrier for the molecules—they can diffuse
into the trap, but until the partial pressure of the molecules already in the trap is sufﬁciently high, they
cannot diffuse out. The surface area of this “event horizon” through which the molecules fall increases
with increasing power, which is why the rate of increase of concentration was observed to increase in the
experiments (Singer et al. 2006).

We have shown that optical tweezers can be used to control the concentration of macromolecules in so-
lution. These results illuminate the thermodynamics of optical tweezers, and provide a striking example
of diffusion under an applied force. This suggests that optical tweezers may be a useful tool to study the
equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics of polymer or other molecules in solution.

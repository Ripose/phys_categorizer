Abstract

We present an analytical approach to the calculation of the linewidth and lineshift of an atom
or molecule in the near ﬁeld of a structured dielectric surface. For soft surface corrugations with
amplitude λ/50, we ﬁnd variations of the linewidth in the ten percent region. More strikingly, the
shift of the molecular resonance can reach several natural linewidths. We demonstrate that the lateral
resolution is of the order of the molecule-surface distance. We give a semiquantitative explanation of
the outcome of our calculations that is based on simple intuitive models.

Introduction

It is well accepted that the natural linewidth of the
excited state of an atom, as well as the exact value
of its energy levels, are greatly inﬂuenced by quantum
ﬂuctuations. When an atom is conﬁned in a geometry
the existence of the boundary conditions for the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld results in modiﬁcations of the atomic
radiative properties. There have been many theoreti-
cal works on the calculation and interpretation of these
eﬀects using quantum electrodynamics [1]. Much of
the physics involved can be addressed, however, by re-
placing a two-level atom by a classical dipole moment
and treating its radiation in the presence of boundaries
[2]. Such an approach is quite successful in treating the
modiﬁcation of spontaneous emission due to the new en-
vironment. The energy level shifts of the atomic states
in the near ﬁeld can also be described very well using
this model [3]. One ﬁnds the well-known Lennard-Jones
potential which is proportional to 1/z3. In the far ﬁeld,
however, the Casimir-Polder shift, as well as the ex-
act numerical value of the oscillatory resonant coupling
of the excited state can be obtained only from a fully
quantum electrodynamic treatment [3, 4].

From the experimental side many groups have tried
to study various aspects of these phenomena in diﬀerent
systems. The ﬁrst experimental evidence for the mod-
iﬁcation of spontaneous emission was demonstrated in
1970 by Drexhage [5]. Here a very thin layer of ﬂuo-
rescing ions were separated from the underlying surface
by a thin spacer layer, and the emission lifetime was
recorded for diﬀerent spacings. This technique has been
used extensively ever since due to its simplicity and its
very high vertical spatial resolution [6]. Direct exper-
imental veriﬁcation of the energy level shifts of atoms
in conﬁned geometries was also demonstrated success-
fully more recently by performing high resolution spec-
troscopy [7, 8, 9]. Following the discovery of Surface
Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in the early eighties
the more complex case of a molecule in the vicinity
of rough surfaces attracted much attention. Several re-
searchers have studied the emission properties of an en-
semble of dye molecules on rough surfaces and gratings
[10, 11, 12, 13]. Very recently there have been also some
eﬀorts on the spectroscopy of atoms placed on a thin
organic layer above a rough surface [14].

In this paper we treat the modiﬁcation of the ra-
diative properties of an atom or a molecule placed

1

very close to a surface with lateral optical contrast.
Our work is mainly motivated by the recent progress
in the ﬁeld of Scanning Near-ﬁeld Optical Microscopy
(SNOM) which has opened the door to optical mi-
croscopy and spectroscopy with lateral resolution be-
yond the diﬀraction limit. In the most common SNOM
conﬁguration one arrives at this high resolution by ex-
amining the sample in the near ﬁeld of a sub-wavelength
metallic aperture. Indeed, single molecules on a surface
have been detected with this method, and it has been
veriﬁed that the molecular lifetime is modiﬁed by the
presence of the aperture [15]. A more elegant approach
to SNOM uses the ﬂuorescence of a single molecule
as a probe [16]. Here one can record the molecular
emission intensity or alternatively the molecular life-
time as a measure for the interaction of the molecule
with the sample surface. Girard and coworkers have
shown numerical calculations for the modiﬁcation of
the molecule’s lifetime as it is positioned above a sam-
ple with nanometric topographic features [17, 18]. In
the present paper we propose an analytical approach
for this problem based on a perturbative method from
scattering theory. Our approach is valid in the domain
of soft surface corrugations where a complex surface
geometry can be Fourier decomposed in terms of sinu-
soidal surface gratings whose corrugation amplitude is
small compared to the molecule-substrate distance. In
addition to the modiﬁcation of spontaneous emission
we also consider the modiﬁcations in the molecular en-
ergy level shifts. The latter is particularly interesting in
view of the recent achievements in high resolution spec-
troscopy of single molecules [19]. In Konstanz we are
currently pursuing experiments which aim at the mea-
surement of the energy level shifts of a single molecule
in the vicinity of a surface [20]. As we show in this pa-
per one can take advantage of the extremely high lateral
resolution in this system to perform a novel form of op-
tical microscopy.

2 Presentation of the model

We are interested in the radiative properties of an atom
or molecule (called ‘molecule’ in the following) at a po-
sition r in an inhomogeneous environment. In this sec-
tion we ﬁrst outline the description of the environment
and then discuss the model taken for the molecule.

2.1 Environment

We consider the molecule to be placed in the vicinity
of a solid substrate at a distance ranging from a few
nanometers to a few optical wavelengths (see Fig.1).
These distances are large compared to the dipole’s di-

mensions, ensuring its purely electromagnetic interac-
tions with the surface. Moreover, it is appropriate to de-
scribe the solid by a local dielectric function ε(x; ω), al-
lowing the description of the electromagnetic ﬁeld phe-
nomenologically by Maxwell equations.

The substrate surface is given by the equation x3 =
s(x1, x2) where x = (x1, x2, x3) are cartesian coordi-
nates. The surface corrugation is characterized by two
length scales: the typical height h of the vertical corru-
gation and its lateral scale of variation a. In the case
of a surface relief grating h would be the grating ampli-
tude and a its period. In the region below the surface,
x3 < s(x1, x2), the dielectric function is equal to the
squared index of refraction n2 that is assumed to be
real. The dipole is located in vacuum at the position
r = (x, y, z). We explicitly retain its lateral coordinates
x, y since we are interested in the lateral resolution ob-
tained in the variations of the linewidth and lineshift.
In order to simplify the formulas, we shall use the no-
tations X = (x1, x2) and R = (x, y) for the lateral
coordinates.
2.2 Linewidth and frequency shift

To begin with, let us focus on a system with two energy-
levels, a ground state Eg and an excited state Ee con-
nected by an electric dipole transition. We assume that
the transition dipole is oriented parallel to the xj -axis
(j = 1, 2, 3, linear polarization) and write
Dj for the
dipole matrix element. When this atom interacts with
the electromagnetic ﬁeld its energy levels get shifted by
amounts δEg,e(r), and the excited state acquires a ﬁnite
lifetime 1/Γj(r) where Γj(r) is the spontaneous emis-
sion rate. Both linewidth and level shifts may be calcu-
lated in second-order perturbation theory. One obtains
the spontaneous emission rate [21]

tion r, and ωeg = (Ee −

a mode expansion of the electric ﬁeld operator, and
the linewidth (1) connects to squared mode function
amplitudes. We take here a diﬀerent route, follow-
ing the response theory developed by Agarwal [22],
and Wiley and Sipe [23]. More speciﬁcally, we in-
voke the the ﬂuctuation–dissipation–theorem to con-
nect the linewidth Γj to the classical Green function
Gij(x, r; ω). This Green function describes the electric
ﬁeld Edip(x)e−iωt + c.c. (the ‘dipole ﬁeld’) created by

(3)

In the vicinity of an interface the electric ﬁeld radiated
by the dipole diﬀers from that in free space: it contains,
in addition to the well-known dipole ﬁeld [24], the ﬁeld
reﬂected from the surface. We write this ﬁeld in terms

of a Green function Gr
ij (x, r; ω0). Upon insertion into
Eq.(3), we ﬁnd the environment-induced modiﬁcation
δΓj(r) of the linewidth, that now depends on the atom’s
position relative to its inhomogeneous environment. We
stress that in the present approach, the linewidth is lin-
early related to the electric ﬁeld radiated by the dipole,
and it is not necessary to compute squared ﬁeld mode
amplitudes which is a more diﬃcult task in a complex
geometry.

Let us now turn to the shift of the atomic resonance
δEg(r))/~ in the pres-
frequency δωeg,j(r) = (δEe(r)
ence of an interface. By a calculation similar to the
one for the linewidth, Fermi’s Golden Rule yields the
following result (obtained from Eq.(2.9) of Ref.[23]):

The ﬁrst term has a similar form as Eq.(3) but involves the real part of the Green function.

For an atom with more than two states one has to take into account allowed dipole transitions to other energy
levels. Let us focus on the situation depicted in Fig.2 where the excited level Ee is the ﬁrst level above the ground
state Eg. The linewidth Γj is then still given by the two-level expression (1), and the lineshift contains an additional
contribution from higher-lying states Eb

If the excited state decays to more than one lower-lying
level, the decay rate Γj is a sum over several contribu-
tions, each one of the form (3).

It is instructive to compare the linewidth (3) and
the frequency shift (4) obtained from quantum theory
to the corresponding quantities for a classical harmonic

oscillator. This model of the Lorentz atom is widely
used in the optics community [2, 6, 25, 26], and we can
make contact with the work done there. The Lorentz
atom is a harmonic oscillator driven by the local elec-
tric ﬁeld, i.e., the external ﬁeld plus the dipole ﬁeld (2).
Since this ﬁeld is proportional to the dipole moment

itself, it shifts the resonance frequency and leads to a
ﬁnite damping rate.

For a linearly polarized dipole along the xj-axis posi-
tioned in an inhomogeneous environment, the shift δωj
and the damping rate Γj are obtained from a straight-
forward calculation [27]. Normalizing to the free-space
linewidth Γ∞, one obtains for weak radiation damping
(in SI units)

and involves the diﬀerence in size of the electronic wave
function in the ground and excited states (a diﬀerence
that cancels for a two-level atom [28]). As far as the lat-
eral resolution is concerned, we may therefore treat the
case of a classical dipole and use Eq.(6) for simplicity.
The exact magnitudes of the line shifts and linewidths
for realistic molecules can be then easily calculated con-
sidering the above-mentioned discussion.

3 Reﬂected ﬁeld calculation

where k0 = ω0/c is the vacuum wavenumber. As in the
quantum mechanical calculation, the imaginary part of
the classical Green function determines the linewidth.
The ﬂuorescence rate Γj may thus be computed clas-
sically [21], and although we focus in the following on
the classical dipole model, our results for the linewidth
remain valid for a generic atom. As for the lineshift
given by Eq.(6), the classical calculation only yields the
ﬁrst term of the quantum-mechanical results (4, 5), and
the nonresonant frequency integrals of the Green func-
tion are not accounted for. This implies a limited va-
lidity of the classical model for frequency shift calcula-
tions. In this paper, however, we are mainly interested
in studying the variations in the radiative properties of
an atom as a function of its lateral position very close
It is quite common that the

3.1 Outline

Our task is now to compute the Green function above
the substrate, i.e., the reﬂected ﬁeld created by an oscil-
lating point dipole. The basic equations are the macro-
scopic Maxwell equations, given the dielectric function
ε(x; ω) and the external current j(x, t) =
−
r)e−iω0t + c.c., supplemented by the boundary condi-
tions for the ﬁeld at the surface. We make the following
ansatz for the electric ﬁeld in vacuum above the solid

iω0dδ(x

−

E(x, t) =

Efs(x) + Er(x)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

e−iω0t + c.c.

(8)

where Efs(x) is the dipole ﬁeld in free space, and Er(x)
is its environment-induced modiﬁcation (the reﬂected
ﬁeld). The latter is source-free above the surface. The
total ﬁeld (8) is matched at the surface of the solid
to a ‘transmitted ﬁeld’ (source-free inside the solid).
This matching determines the reﬂected and transmit-
ted ﬁelds in terms of the free space dipole ﬁeld.

In general the boundary conditions are complicated,
and exact solutions are only known for simple geome-
tries. In order to proceed analytically, we resort to an
approximate solution for a ‘slightly corrugated surface’,
i.e., a vertical corrugation small compared to the sep-
aration of the molecule from the surface. The precise
validity of this approximation is discussed in Sec.6. The

4

boundary conditions may then be linearized around the
mean value of the surface function and solved to ﬁrst
order in the surface corrugation. We thus end up with
three terms for the linewidth

Γj(r) = Γ∞ + δΓ0

j (z) + δΓ1

j (R, z)

(9)

The ﬁrst term is the vacuum linewidth. The second
comes from the reﬂection at the ﬂat surface (zeroth or-
der ﬁeld), and the third from the ﬁrst-order scattering
oﬀ the surface corrugation. This last term contains in-
formation about the lateral surface structure since it
depends on the lateral coordinate R = (x, y). A re-
lation similar to (9) also holds for the frequency shift
δωj(r).

3.2 Approximate solution

In order to ﬁnd the reﬂected ﬁeld to ﬁrst order, we
use the so-called ‘method of small perturbations’ well-
known in light scattering from rough surfaces [29, 30,
31]. With this method, one usually computes the re-
ﬂected ﬁeld for an incident plane wave. We thus expand
the free space dipole ﬁeld into Fourier components and
work out the reﬂected ﬁeld for each component. This
approach is similar to that of Rahman and Maradudin
[32] and of George and co-workers [13, 33].

3.2.1 Fourier expansions

The free space dipole ﬁeld is well known and may be
found from the following formula for the Green func-
tion (in SI units) [24, 31]

with the wavenumber k0 = ω/c. Using the notation
K = (k1, k2) for the lateral wave vector components
and recalling the notations x = (X, x3), r = (R, z)
etc. for the lateral and vertical coordinates, the Weyl

and the square root is chosen such that Re k3, Im k3 >

tains both ‘far ﬁeld’ and ‘near ﬁeld’ contributions, cor-
responding to lateral wave vectors with magnitude K

smaller and larger than the optical wavenumber k0, re-
spectively.

Combining Eqs.(2, 10, 11), we ﬁnd the following

To solve the boundary conditions, the expansion (13)
(and its counterpart (16) for the reﬂected ﬁeld) is as-
sumed to be valid down to the surface x3 = s(X).
This is actually a hypothesis, the ‘Rayleigh hypothe-
sis’, as discussed by Nieto-Vesperinas [31]. Note that
the present approach also relies on the assumption that
the dipole is located above the maximum surface height,
otherwise the absolute value
in Eq.(11) must
be retained which complicates the calculation.

As used by Agarwal [30] we apply the ‘extinction

integral equations involving the ﬁeld immediately above
and below the surface. The integrand is evaluated at
the surface, and only zeroth and ﬁrst order terms in
the proﬁle function s(R) are taken into account. The
reﬂected ﬁeld thus contains zeroth and ﬁrst order con-
tributions that are discussed separately in the following.

3.2.2 Zeroth order: ﬂat surface

The zeroth order result for the reﬂected ﬁeld is obtained
from the reﬂection of each Fourier component from a
ﬂat surface and involves the corresponding Fresnel co-
eﬃcient rµ(K). In the expansion

The integration variable is the reduced wave vector

corresponds to ﬁeld modes that are plane waves in at

the linewidth only depends on
these modes. For modes with larger wave vectors,
u > n, the phase factor e2ik3z and the reﬂection co-
eﬃcients rµ become real and the integrands in Eqs.(19,
20) become purely imaginary. Hence these modes only
appear in the lineshift. This property does not hold any
more when absorption in the dielectric is taken into ac-

count [26, 27] because the refraction index n and hence
the reﬂection coeﬃcients rµ are complex for any wave
vector.

3.2.3 First order: lateral structure

The ﬁrst order contribution to the reﬂected ﬁeld is
Fourier-expanded as in Eq.(16), and from the calcula-
tion outlined above, one ﬁnds that the Fourier compo-
nents equal [30, 35, 36]

We observe in Eq.(23) that each wave vector K of
the free-space dipole ﬁeld is diﬀracted by the Fourier
component s(K′

a way that the propagation from the dipole down to
the surface and back again gives rise to a phase factor

has been introduced. In this formula, it is understood
that K′ = K + Q and k′
3 is the corresponding verti-
cal wave vector component (eq.(12)). Eq.(24) shows
that Fj(Q) determines the relative contribution of the
proﬁle’s Fourier components s(Q) to the linewidth and
-shift. Of particular interest is the width of this “ﬁlter”
as a function of the grating vector Q since it determines
the lateral resolution of the image.

We show in Fig.3 contour plots of the imaginary
part of the integrand in Eq.(25) for two diﬀerent grat-
ing vectors Q. It is apparent that the integrand does
not have a simple angular dependence in the plane of
wave vectors K. This implies that in contrast to the
ﬂat surface case Eq.(18), the angular integral cannot be
done analytically here, and the transfer function has to
be computed numerically. In Fig.3 one or two circular
structures appear to dominate the integrand, depending
on the magnitude of the grating vector Q. To interpret
these features, we come back to the Green function (23)
that describes the ﬁrst-order reﬂected ﬁeld. For a given
Fourier component K of the incident dipole ﬁeld and a
given grating vector Q = K′
K of the surface proﬁle
the scattered ﬁeld amplitude is equal to the proﬁle’s
Fourier amplitude s(Q), multiplied by the product of
two factors. The ﬁrst is an electromagnetic scattering
factor represented by the matrix L(K′), the transmis-
sion coeﬃcients tµ(K) and polarization vectors eµ(K)
for the ﬂat surface. The second factor is the exponen-
tial exp i(k3 + k′
3)z describing the vertical propagation
of the ﬁeld from the dipole to the surface and back
again. The magnitude of the second factor depends on

−

the character (propagating or evanescent) of the inci-
dent and diﬀracted waves. In particular, the wave vec-
tors k3 and k′
3 become imaginary for large K, K ′, and
the exponential is very small. This limits the relevant
range of wave vectors that contribute to the integral.

In the case of the linewidth, the limitation is even
more strict. It is determined by the imaginary part of
the integrand (cf. Eq.(25)) and is given by two circu-
lar domains of incident wave vectors K with K < nk0
or K ′ < nk0 because it is only in these domains that
the exponential exp i(k3 + k′
3)z and the electromagnetic
scattering factor become complex. These regions are
clearly visible in the right panel of Fig.3. The grating
vector Q is here suﬃciently large to separate the two
disks. The disks are merged in the left panel because
the grating vector is smaller. To summarize, the lateral
variation of the linewidth above a corrugated surface
is dominated by two diﬀerent processes: propagating
Fourier components of the dipole ﬁeld are diﬀracted
into evanescent waves and interfere with the dipole ﬁeld
(the right circular disk of Fig.3, centered at K = 0) and
conversely, evanescent Fourier components of the dipole
ﬁeld are diﬀracted into propagating waves (the left disk,
centered at K =

Q).

Up to now we have determined the ﬂuorescence spec-
trum of a molecule at a constant height z above the
structured surface. It is also possible to perform these
calculations for the more common SNOM scheme of
‘constant-gap’ where the separation of the molecule
from the underlying surface proﬁle is kept at a value
d. In the notation of the present paper one measures
the quantity Γj(R, d + s(R)) where z = d + s(R) is
the vertical coordinate of the molecule. When calcu-
lating this linewidth from Eq.(9) one has to take into
account that our theory only describes surface corruga-
tions s(R) small compared to the gap d. We thus ﬁnd
a linewidth

The lateral structure is contained in the last two terms,
the ﬁrst of which corresponds to the derivative of the
ﬂat-surface linewidth.
It turns out that the transfer
function for the constant-gap mode can be written in
the following form

˜Fj (Q; d) = Fj(Q; d)

Imaging a grating

We now examine linewidths and -shifts when the dipole
is laterally scanned at a constant height above a si-
nusoidal grating with surface proﬁle s(R) = s(x) =
h cos Qx (grooves parallel to the y-axis). This sim-
ple geometry reveals the dependence of the radiative
properties on the four most important length scales (cf.
ﬁg.1): the corrugation height h, the corrugation pe-
riod a (equal to 2π/Q for a grating), the molecule’s
distance z from the average surface and the transition
wavelength λ = 2π/k0. Finally, one also has to take into
account the dipole’s orientation. Translational symme-
try implies that linewidth and -shift are independent of
y, but they are sinusoidal as a function of the lateral po-
sition x since they depend linearly on the surface proﬁle
(cf. Eq.(24) and Fig.4). All the relevant physics is thus
encoded in their modulation amplitude [37]. Since this
amplitude is simply proportional to the grating height
h, this length scale is already dealt with.

In Fig.4 the grating has subwavelength corrugation
amplitude (0.016 λ) and period (0.1 λ), the substrate is
a dielectric with refractive index n = 1.5 (glass) and
negligible absorption, while the dipole is polarized per-
pendicular to the grating surface (z-polarization). We
observe that at an average distance from the grating
of 0.032 λ, the linewidth modulation amounts to 20 %
of the natural linewidth. A much larger modulation is

observed in the lineshift which amounts up to several
natural linewidths. We would like to stress this feature
because frequency shifts have not been considered very
much in the optics community, perhaps because they
are more diﬃcult to measure. Our calculations show
that in near-ﬁeld optics, the lineshift is much more sen-
sitive (on an absolute frequency scale) to the surface
corrugation than the linewidth. This relatively large
eﬀect is related to the large frequency shift close to a
ﬂat surface, as discussed in subsection 4.2. We discuss
the dependence of linewidth and lineshift on the dis-
tance from the grating and its period in the next two
sections.
4.1 The linewidth

In ﬁg.5(a) we show the amplitude of the linewidth mod-
ulation above a grating with subwavelength period, as
a function of the distance z. One observes that the
three dipole orientations show diﬀerent behavior, and
that the linewidth modulation decreases rapidly with
increasing distance from the grating. This decrease is
quite well ﬁtted with an exponential law e−Qz, as shown
in the inset. Such a law is to be expected since as dis-
cussed at the end of section 3.3, the linewidth is domi-
nated by diﬀraction processes where the incoming wave
has a small parallel wave vector (see ﬁg.3, right panel).
The diﬀracted wave then has a parallel component with
wave vector K′
Q whose amplitude decays exponen-

k0. This is the phenomenon which allows one to exploit
the modiﬁcations of the lifetime to image nanometric
structures in the near ﬁeld. Fig.5(a) also shows devi-
ations from a pure exponential decay of the linewidth,
we come back to these in eq.(29).

In Fig.6(a) we plot the amplitude of the linewidth
modulation as a function of the average distance z for
a large grating period. One observes that the modu-
lation amplitude decreases more slowly than in ﬁg.5(a)
and even shows oscillations for distances of the order of
the wavelength. In the extreme case of grating period
much larger than the wavelength this behavior of the
linewidth may be understood in a simple manner. In
this case one may write the linewidth modulation in the

The linewidth modulation amplitude turns out to be
proportional to the derivative of the ﬂat surface result.
In Fig.6(a), the result of this model is indicated by the
thin lines which coincide quite well with the full calcu-
lation (symbols) although the grating period is taken
to be only 5 λ. We note, however, that in this simple
model the two lateral polarizations x and y are always

degenerate since they both derive from the linewidth
δΓ0
k(z) of a dipole polarized parallel to a ﬂat surface.
Fig.7(a) shows the modulations of the linewidth as
a function of the grating vector Q for a ﬁxed height z.
We observe that grating periods larger than λ (Q
k0)
yield a result similar to that of a ﬂat surface, x- and y-
polarization being degenerate. As the period decreases
below the wavelength, this degeneracy is lifted, and we
observe an overall increase in the linewidth modula-
2nk0. For still
tion with some steep features for Q
smaller grating periods the linewidth modulation de-
creases again in an approximately exponential manner.

It is possible to give an asymptotic expression for
the transfer function (25) covering the regime of sub-
wavelength corrugations which is particularly interest-
ing for applications in optical near-ﬁeld microscopy.
This asymptotic expansion is motivated by Fig.3 (right
panel) where we have seen that the integrand of the
transfer function is dominated by two circular regions
of wave vectors. In the limit of Q large compared to k0
these regions are well separated and have approximately
circular symmetry. In both cases the angular integra-
tions may be performed analytically, and one arrives at
formulae very similar to those for a ﬂat surface (19, 20).

It can be seen from Fig.7(a) that these asymp-

modulation of the linewidth above subwavelength grat-
λ/5. We may therefore use
ings with periods a
eqs.(29–32) to estimate the lateral resolution δR for
this type of near-ﬁeld microscopy: the exponential cut-
oﬀ of high spatial frequencies in Eq.(29) yields δR

the distance from the surface. Note also that the y-
polarization gives both a smaller signal and a slightly
worse resolution compared to the other two polariza-

tions, which is due to the missing of the factor Q/k0 in
Eq.(29). This is physically plausible because the elec-
tric ﬁeld is then continuous across the interface, leading
to less scattering from the surface corrugation.

Apart from its larger modulation amplitude,
the
lineshift above a sinusoidal grating shows a behavior
not very diﬀerent from that of the linewidth. In ﬁg.5(b)

again a rapid decrease of the modulation amplitude
with increasing distance. Vector diﬀraction is relevant
and leads to diﬀerent results for the three polarizations,
the x-polarization in particular showing a sign change
(dots). At distances larger than 1/Q, the lineshift shows
an exponential decrease similar to the linewidth, as
shown by the solid and dotted lines. These lines are ﬁts
to the model function K2(Qz)/z2 introduced in eq.(33)
below.

The case of a grating period larger than the wave-
length is shown in ﬁg.6(b). The x- and y-polarizations
show identical lineshifts as above a ﬂat surface. The dis-
tance dependence is well described by the simple model
based on eq.(28), involving the derivative of the ﬂat-
surface result. In particular, the lineshift shows a 1/z4
power law if the dipole’s distance is smaller than about
λ/(2π), as expected from electrostatics.

Finally, ﬁg.7(b) displays the amplitude of the
lineshift modulation if the grating period is varied. The
x, y-polarizations show smooth crossovers from large to
small periods, and the modulation amplitude globally
decreases for very small periods. This latter feature can
be understood from a simple electrostatic calculation,
as we discuss now.

We model the substrate as a continuous distribution
of dipoles (with density ρdip) with which the molecule
interacts via a (scalar) c6/r6 law. The total frequency
shift is obtained by integrating over the half-space
ﬁlled with these dipoles. For a ﬂat substrate one ob-
tains the familiar power law δω0(z) =
c3/z3 with
c3 = πρdipc6/6.
If the substrate is corrugated, the
surface region gives an additional contribution to the
frequency shift. To ﬁrst order in the surface proﬁle, one
obtains:

where δω1(Q; z) is a Fourier transform with respect to
the lateral coordinates R and K2(Qz) is the modiﬁed
Bessel function of the second kind. As we show in
ﬁg.7(b), this simple model (thick solid line) describes
quite well the frequency shift for an unpolarized dipole
(averaged over the three linear polarizations, shown by
the open circles). For large periods the shift becomes
3c3/z4, the derivative
independent of Q and tends to
of the ﬂat-surface shift (this follows from the proper-
ties of the Bessel K-function) while for small periods
we ﬁnd an exponential suppression similar to eq.(29):

In this model we may thus explain the suppression of
high spatial frequencies in the lineshift variations by

the fact that the frequency shift samples a patch of the
surface whose radius is of order z, thus washing out
structures at lateral scales smaller than a
z. As a
consequence, we expect for lineshift images a lateral
resolution of the order of z.

≤

We ﬁnally note that similar to the linewidth (29),
the lineshift (34) above a subwavelength grating does
not show a pure exponential decay with increasing dis-
tance z (see also inset of ﬁg.5(b)).

5 Imaging an arbitrary substrate

As pointed out above, our theory is linear in the sur-
face corrugation and hence able to describe both sinu-
soidal and arbitrary proﬁles. An example of a generic
(two-dimensional) surface is shown in Fig.8. One ob-
serves a low lateral resolution and quite a weak sig-
λ/2π (top
nal at an average height z = 100 nm
panel) with the linewidth and -shift having compara-
ble magnitudes. The situation changes dramatically at
closer distances (z = 20 nm
0.2 λ/2π, middle panel)
where subwavelength structures are well resolved. Note
that the linewidth gives a slightly poorer ‘image quality’
than the lineshift. This is due to the fact that the spec-
tral response of the lineshift behaves more smoothly as
a function of wave vector than that of the linewidth
(compare ﬁgs.7(a) and (b)). In other words, some spa-
tial frequencies are enhanced in the linewidth image,
leading to a distortion of the observed structures.

One advantage of optical near-ﬁeld microscopy over
other scanning probe techniques is its ability to yield
information beyond the sample topography, namely
about its optical contrast. In fact, often samples with
large topographic features are undesirable in SNOM
because they lead to the coupling of the optical and
topographic information [39, 40].
It is important to
point out that our theory also applies to substrates with
purely optical contrast and no topography. For this we
use the result of Carminati and Greﬀet that in near-
ﬁeld optics variations of the dielectric constant may be
described by an ‘equivalent surface proﬁle’ seq(X) [41].
This quantity corresponds to the vertical integral of the
optical contrast:

where k3 and k′
3 are the wave vectors of the incident
dipole ﬁeld and the diﬀracted ﬁeld, respectively. For
far-ﬁeld calculations, k3 and k′
3 are real and limited to
the optical wave vector k0. Therefore, we obtain the
condition
λ/2π, where h characterizes
the surface corrugation. For calculations in the near
ﬁeld one has to include imaginary values of k3 and k′
3.
The relevant wave vectors, however, are limited in size
because the ﬁnite distance z leads to an exponential
damping; this is also apparent in Eq.(25). We hence

period a well below λ all diﬀraction orders are evanes-
cent, and the diﬀracted wave vectors are of the order
of k′
Q = 2π/a. In order to perform the lineariza-
tion (36) in this regime, we have to impose the condition
a. In summary, our method is valid in the regime

Note that no restriction is made regarding the relative
magnitude of the three length scales on the right-hand-
side. For a sample with optical contrast it is shown in
Ref.[41] that the perturbation method is also subject
to condition (37), but now for the equivalent surface
proﬁle. In particular, this is the case if the index inho-
mogeneities are conﬁned to a narrow region around the
interface, below which the sample is homogeneous.
7 Concluding remarks

The theory presented here may be generalized to take
absorption of the substrate into account. In the classical

picture this is simply done by using a complex index of
refraction. In the quantum mechanical picture several
schemes have been proposed [42, 43, 44, 45] to quantize
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the presence of absorbing
dielectrics, involving diﬀerent models for the dielectric
medium. Using the theory of Scheel, Kn¨oll, and Welsch
[45], it is easy to check that the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem still holds. The identiﬁcation of the ﬁeld corre-
lation function in Eq.(1) with the imaginary part of the
classical Green function in Eq.(3) hence carries over to
the absorbing substrate. From the viewpoint of quan-
tum optics this substantiates the use of the classical
Lorentz oscillator to compute the ﬂuorescence lifetime
of real molecules in arbitrary environments.

We now would like to remark on a few physical ef-
fects which take place beyond the regime (37) and there-
fore, are not taken into account by our current treat-
ment:

(i) If the grating corrugation is comparable to the
λ, one expects many diﬀraction or-
wavelength h
ders to be populated. In this regime the calculation of
the reﬂected ﬁeld has to be reﬁned using a full grating

theory. At large distances from such a ‘deep grating’
the physics should be quite similar to standard far-ﬁeld
grating diﬀraction. At smaller distances the molecule
samples non-propagating diﬀraction orders, and evanes-
cent components of the incidence dipole ﬁeld could lead
to qualitative changes of the linewidth. If the grating’s
‘depth’ exceeds several wavelengths, one may expect
the formation of a partial photonic band gap, modify-
ing the near ﬁeld. Since for a complete band gap only
evanescent light modes are present, molecular ﬂuores-
cence would be a very interesting probe to study the

paper we intend to consider a grating with a square
proﬁle for which an exact diﬀraction theory is available
[46, 47, 48, 49].

≤

(ii) If the molecule is put into the selvedge region
of the grating, i.e. z
h, it is nearly completely sur-
rounded by the substrate. One then expects that only
the local environment plays a role, the molecule being
unable to sense the periodicity of the grating. Numeri-
cal calculations have been done [17, 18, 50] which show
steep variations of the lifetime and a strong polariza-

14

tion dependence. We plan to study the square grating
model alluded to above to get an analytical insight into
this situation.

In conclusion, we have calculated the modiﬁcation of
the ﬂuorescence spectrum of a molecule that is scanned
above a slightly corrugated surface. We have shown
that the molecule’s linewidth and lineshift are inﬂu-
enced by both surface topography and optical contrast.
The linewidth acquires variations that amount up to
20 %, while the lineshift varies over as much as several
natural linewidths. Furthermore, for an arbitrary sur-
face proﬁle the lineshift shows a slightly better ﬁdelity
to the sample structure. We have also presented simple
models and formulae that allow us to obtain an intuitive
understanding of the our results for corrugations and
distances both below and above the molecular transi-
tion wavelength. Perhaps the most important outcome
of this paper is that the lateral resolution in the ‘ﬂu-
orescence images’ we have obtained is of the order of
the molecule-surface distance. One would then expect
to reach a molecular resolution in a novel form of scan-
ning optical microscopy if the probe molecule could be
brought nearly in contact with the sample. Recent ex-
perimental progress in the ﬁeld of single molecule detec-
tion, spectroscopy and manipulation give a tantalizing
hope for the realization of this goal in the near future.

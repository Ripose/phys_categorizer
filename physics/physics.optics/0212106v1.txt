ABSTRACT

The Kerr-lens mode locking stability and the ultrashort pulse characteristics are analyzed numerically for the Cr-
doped ZnTe, ZnSe, ZnS active media. The advantages of these materials for the femtosecond lasing within 2 - 3 µm
spectral range are demonstrated.

Keywords: ultrashort pulses, Kerr-lens mode-locking, mid-infrared solid-state lasers

1. INTRODUCTION

Compact diode-pumped sources of the femtosecond pulses tunable within the wavelength range between 2 and 3
µm are of interest for various applications, such as laser surgery, remote sensing and monitoring, spectroscopy of
semiconductors etc. To date only cryogenically operated Pb-salt diode lasers, optical parametrical oscillators and
diﬀerence-frequency convertors were available for the operation in this spectral range. Therefore the possibility of
the direct mid-IR lasing from the new class of the transition-metal doped chalcogenides 1,2,3,4 has attracted much
attention. The impressive advantages of these media are room-temperature operation between 2 and 3 µm, possibility
of direct diode pumping, high emission and absorption cross-sections, negligibly low excited-state absorption and,
as consequence, low thermal load (the basic laser material characteristics will be described in the next section).
The most remarkable examples of the lasers under consideration are Cr2+-doped ZnSe, ZnS and ZnTe. To date the
following achievements for these media have been demonstrated: 1) for Cr:ZnSe CW operation with over 1.7 W
power ,5 over 1100 nm tunability ,6 over 350 nm tunable diode-pumped CW operation ,7 active mode locking
8 and active modulator assisted passive mode locking 9 were achieved; 2) for Cr:ZnS pulsed 2,10 and tunable CW
operation 11 were obtained. Cr:ZnTe, which is a member of the considered media class, remains unexplored.

In spite of the numerous advantages, there exist some obstacles for femtosecond pulse generation from these
lasers. As they are the semiconductors, i.e. possess a comparatively narrow band-gap, the nonlinear refraction in the
active crystal is extremely large (see below). Hence the self-focusing has a low threshold which in the combination
with the strong self-phase modulation produce a tendency to multiple pulse operation in the Kerr-lens mode locking
(KLM) regime .9,12 So there is a need in the study of KLM stability limits and methods of stability enhancement
in the lasers under consideration.

In this paper we present the results of the numerical optimization of KLM aimed at the multipulsing suppression
and taking into account a strong saturation of the Kerr-lens induced fast absorber. As a result, we demonstrate the
possibility of few optical cycle generation from Cr-doped Zinc-chalcogenodes. The presented model is quite general
and can be applied to the overall optimization of the diﬀerent KLM lasers.

2. MODEL AND BASIC PARAMETERS

Simulation of the KLM can be based on the two quite diﬀerent approaches. First one supposes the full-dimensional
modelling taking into account the details of the ﬁeld propagation in the laser cavity .13 The minimal dimension of
such models is 2+1 and the optimization procedure needs mainframe computing. Although this approach allows the
description of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ultrashort pulses and their mode pattern, its main disadvantages
are the large number of the parameters resulting in ambiguity of the optimization procedure and complexity of the
interpretation of the obtained results. Second approach is based on 1+1 dimensional model in the framework of
the so-called nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau equation ,14 which describes the KLM as an action of the fast saturable
absorber governed by few physically meaningful parameters, viz., its modulation depth γ and the inverse saturation

intensity σ. This method allows the analytical realization in the week-nonlinear limit ,15 however in the general case
the numerical simulations are necessary. We shall be based on the latter approach in view of its physical unambiguity.

where a(z, t) is the ﬁeld amplitude (so that |a|2 has a dimension of the intensity), z is the longitudinal coordinate

time, α is the saturated gain coeﬃcient, ρ is the linear net-loss coeﬃcient taking into account the intracavity and

medium gives a main contribution to the SPM). The last term in Eq. (1) describes the self-steepening eﬀect and for
the simpliﬁcation will be not taken into account in the simulations. As an additional simpliﬁcation we neglect the
stimulated Raman scattering in the active medium .16 These two factors will be considered hereafter.

The gain coeﬃcient obeys the following equation:

For the numerical simulations it is convenient to normalize the time and the intensity to tf = λ2

0/(∆λc) and 1/δ,
respectively (∆λ is the gain bandwidth). The simulation were performed on the 212 × 104 mesh. Only steady-state
pulses were considered. As the criterion of the steady-state operation we chose the peak intensity change less than
1% over last 1000 cavity transits.

The KLM in the considered model is governed by only four basic parameters: α − ρ, β2, γ, and σ. This allows
unambiguous multiparametric optimization. In the presence of the higher-order GDD, the additional βm parameters
appear. This complicates the optimization procedure, but keeps its physical clarity.

Now let us to give the basic material parameters governing the femtosecond oscillation in the lasers under

consideration.

It should be noted that the n values correspond to λ0, but the experimentally observed n2 correspond to λ=1.06
µm (see Ref.17). As a result, we need the theoretical estimation of their values at the generation wavelength. Such
estimation can be obtained from the formula 17:

where K = (0.5 - 1.5)×10−8 and Ep = 21 eV are the material independent constants, Eg is the band-gap width in
eV, G is the form-factor. Using for K the value, which produces the best agreement with the experimental values of

We note that the semiconductor nature of the considered active media results in the extremely high nonlinear
refraction coeﬃcients in the comparison with Ti:sapphire, for example (1.2×10−13 esu). As it will be shown below,
this has a pronounced manifestation in the femtosecond pulse dynamics.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

First of all we have to consider the meaning of the optimization procedure. The numerical simulations demonstrate
that there exist some values of the saturation parameter σ, which provide the near chirp-free pulse generation. These
values of σ can be considered as “optimal”. However, there is the additional factor, which has to be taken into
account: the pulse shortening is possible by the σ growth and β2 →0. We consider the values of β2 and σ as optimal
if they correspond to the generation of the shortest pulse. The main obstacle on the way of the pulse shortening
is the multiple pulse generation.12 The strong tendency to the multipulsing results from 1) E−1
decrease, 2) P
increase, 3) fast absorber saturation favored by the large σ. The relatively large values of σg and λ0 for the considered
media result in the increase of the ﬁrst parameter. However, the large absorption cross sections and SPM coeﬃcients
increase two later parameters. If the growth of the ﬁrst parameter corresponds to the gain saturation and thereby to
the stabilization of the pulse against the laser continuum growth, the larger P and σ initiate the rise of the continuum
and the excitation of the perturbations inside the ultrashort pulse.18 Hence, the optimization means the multiple
pulses suppression allowing the pulse shortening.

s

Additional limitations on the pulse shortening result from the achievable values of the saturation parameter σ.
In the KLM lasers this parameters is governed by the cavity alignment: the shift towards the cavity stability zone
increases σ. So, the highest values of σ are reached in the immediate vicinity of the cavity stability boundary.
This demands a too thorough cavity optimization and can not be considered as operational. Hence, the optimization
aimed at the pulse shortening is based on the variation of all four parameters of the master Eq. (1) and is constrained
by the above described reasons.

Fig. 1 shows the parameters of Eq. (1), which for the ﬁxed α − ρ, γ and σ correspond to the minimum achievable
β2 where the pulse has a minimum. The further β2 decrease results in the multipulse operation. Thus, the points in

Fig. 1 lie on the boundary of the stable single pulse operation. There is a set of the general tendencies characterizing
this boundary.

There exists a limited on α − ρ range of the stable single pulse operation, which expands as a result of the σ and
γ growth. The increase of σ shifts this region towards the smaller α − ρ. However, when σ >100 the transition to
multipulsing is possible. As every point in Fig. 1 corresponds to the ﬁxed dimensionless E (see Fig. 2), the choice
of the appropriate level of α − ρ for the ﬁxed laser conﬁguration (i.e. ﬁxed γ, σ and β2) is realized by the variation
of P (pump, see Eq. (3)) as well as ρ (output loss). It is possible also to change α by the change of αmax due to
variation of the crystal length or the active ions concentration or by the change of Tr due to variation of the active
ions concentration. Note also, that the lg decrease increases ǫ (due to the δ decrease), which describes the “strength”
of the gain saturation relatively the SPM, and thereby increases P providing some ﬁxed α. Hence, ǫ increase expands
the stability region towards the higher pump and allows the higher pulse energies (because they ∝ 1/δ).

The E decrease for the ﬁxed α − ρ, which takes a place for β2 →0 (Fig. 2), has to be accompanied by P , αmax,
Tr decrease or by ǫ, ρ increase in order to prevent from the continuum ampliﬁcation. The last is the main source
of the pulse destabilization and suppresses the single pulse operation in the vicinity of zero GDD. Hence, the pulse
generation for α − ρ − γ >0 is not possible. α − ρ − γ =0 corresponds to the speciﬁc hybrid regime with the coexistent

pulse and continuum .19

Since the approach of GDD to zero has to be accompanied by the pump decrease, this results in the growth of the
σ required for the pulse stabilization (Fig. 1). This can demand too thorough cavity alignment. Moreover, for the
large σ we need the larger minimum |β2| providing the single pulse operation so that the dependence of the minimum
|β2| on the σ for the ﬁxed α − ρ has a parabolic-like form .18

The most interesting features are the shift of the stability region towards the smaller σ (Fig. 1) and the pulse
shortening as a result of the γ increase. For example, the minimum pulse duration τp for γ =0.03 is 7tf whereas for
γ =0.05 it is 5tf (this is 19 fs for Cr:ZnSe and Cr:ZnS and 23 fs for Cr:ZnTe). The bad news here is the need for the
hard-aperture KLM to provide the larger modulation depth. This reduces the KLM self-starting ability.

The regions of the parameters allowing the shortest pulses are shown in Fig. 3. The α − ρ increase reduces the
minimum σ parameter producing the shortest pulses. However the region of their existence shortens on σ. The τp
growth enlarges the corresponding region.

Let us consider the concrete parameters of Table 3. The pump thresholds allowing 7tf pulse durations are shown
in Fig. 4. The threshold decreases from Cr:ZnS through Cr:ZnSe to Cr:ZnTe that results from the ǫ decrease. This
means that the SPM becomes stronger relatively the gain saturation under this transition. As a result, the tendency
to the pulse destabilization intensiﬁes and this demands to reduce the intracavity power by means of the pump
decrease.

Thus, the ǫ decrease reducing KLM threshold turns in the intracavity pulse energy decrease (Fig. 5). The
highest value of ǫ for Cr:ZnS resulting from the large σg in the combination with comparatively small δ produces the
stabilization of the shortest pulses with the highest energies.

Note, that the larger absorption cross-section for Cr:ZnTe results in the highest absorbed pump energy for the
ﬁxed pump intensity and mode area. This is a positive factor for the KLM threshold lowering. However, this can
be a negative factor, when the SPM is the source of the pulse destabilization because the additional eﬀorts for the
intracavity power decrease are necessary.

At last, we consider the contribution of the third-order dispersion, which can be large for the lasers under
consideration. There are the technological troubles in the use of the chirped-mirror technique for the dispersion
compensation in the mid-IR due to high value of λ0. Therefore the usual technique utilizing the prisms for the
dispersion control can be useful in the considered situation. As a result, the third-order net-dispersion coeﬃcient
|β3| increases.

Intracavity pulse energy ﬂuxes. The parameters correspond to Fig. 4.

For the simulation we choose β3 =-5900 fs3. As it can be seen from Fig. 6, the shape of the stability boundary
does not change in the comparison to β3 =0 .20 However, the minimum pulse duration increases from 5tf for β3 =0
to 9tf (34 fs for Cr:ZnS, Cr:ZnSe and 40 fs for Cr:ZnTe). The additional eﬀect is the pronounced (up to 140 nm)
Stokes shift of the peak wavelength (Fig. 6 shows this shift on the stability boundary for Cr:ZnSe and Cr:ZnS). This
shift is typical also for such IR lasers as Cr:LiSGaF, Cr:LiSAF, Cr4+:YAG 16,20 and can reduce the pulse energy due
worse overlap between gain band and pulse spectrum. However, for the media under consideration the wavelength
shift is small in comparison to the full gain band width and the energy decrease is not critical.

4. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we presented the model, which can be usable for the numerical optimization of the KLM lasers and
is governed by only four basic parameters: diﬀerence between saturated gain and linear loss, GDD, modulation
depth and saturation intensity of the fast saturable absorber. On the basis of this model, the KLM abilities of
the Cr-doped Zinc-chalcogenides were estimated. It was shown, that the strong SPM inherent to these media and
destabilizing the single pulse operation can be overcomed by the choice of the appropriate GDD, pump, modulation
depth and saturation parameter of the Kerr-lensing induced fast saturable absorber.
It was demonstrated also,
that the continuum ampliﬁcation is reduced by the large gain saturation and the destabilizing nonlinear phase shift
decreases due to high linear refraction and large generation wavelength in the media under consideration. As a result,

the Cr:ZnTe possesses the lowest KLM threshold, however strong SPM constrains the achievable pulse power for this
laser. The best stability for the highest energy ﬂux and the shortest pulse duration (19 fs) are achievable in Cr:ZnS.
Cr:ZnSe lies between these media. The presence of the third-order dispersion increases the minimum achievable pulse
durations up to 34 - 40 fs and causes the strong (up to 140 nm) Stokes shift of the generation wavelength. However,
the latter eﬀect does not reduce noticeably the pulse energy. On the whole, the Cr-doped Zinc-chalcogenides have
the prospects of sub-50 fs generation that amounts to only few optical cycles around 2.5 µm.

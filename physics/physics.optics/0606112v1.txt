(Dated: February 2, 2008)

I present a detailed derivation of wideband optical pulses interacting with a Raman transition
in the kind of scheme currently used to generate the ultra broadband light ﬁelds needed to create
ultrashort pulses. In contrast to the usual approach using separate ﬁeld envelopes for the pump,
Stokes, and anti-Stokes spectral lines, I use a single ﬁeld envelope. This requires the inclusion of few-
cycle corrections to the pulse propagation. The single-ﬁeld model makes fewer approximations and is
mathematically (and hence computationally) simpler, although it does require greater computational
resources to implement. The single-ﬁeld theory reduces to the traditional multi-ﬁeld one using
appropriate approximations.

This report should be read along with the paper Phys. Rev. 72, 033804 (2005) “Wideband pulse
propagation: single-ﬁeld and multi-ﬁeld approaches to Raman interactions” by P. Kinsler, G.H.C.
New [1] for proper context. This document is primarily intended as a complete (as possible) record
of the calculational steps that were necessarily abbreviated (or omitted) from that published work.
It is an edited version of a longer document from which on-going work has been excised; and, as a
”work in progress”, despite my best eﬀorts, may contain occasional mistakes. Please contact me if
you have any comments, corrections or queries.

INTRODUCTION

An important aim of current wideband Raman experiments is to try to eﬃciently generate few-cycle pulses [2, 3,
4, 5]. If driven strongly enough, the two-photon Raman transition modulates the incoming ﬁeld by adding sidebands
separated by the transition frequency. Wideband ﬁelds are generated as these sidebands generate sidebands of their
own (and so on), thus generating a wide comb of frequency components separated by the transition frequency. If
a scheme can be implemented that adjusts the phases of each component appropriately, then few- or single- cycle
optical pulses can be obtained (see e.g. [3]). Standard theoretical treatments of this process split the ﬁeld into ﬁelds
components centred on the teeth of this comb. The approach has the advantage that the components can be modeled
reasonably well with slowly varying envelopes, but of course it has the disadvantage of needing to keep track of a
large number of components.

In experiments like those of Sali et.al.

[5, 6], the Raman transition is driven near-resonantly by a pair of intense
pump pulses about 100fs long; compared to the transition frequency of about 130THz, the spectra of each pump
pulse (and hence the generated sidebands) are relatively narrow. This means that a multi-component model is
still not unreasonable, even if numerical considerations might demand that the arrays used to store these spectra
overlap in frequency space. However, if we were to move to shorter pump pulses, or to a single (much shorter)
pump pulse with enough bandwidth to eﬃciently excite the transition, we would reach the regime where the “teeth”
from the spectral comb signiﬁcantly overlap. At this point, not only would we be forced to move from an SVEA
(Slowly Varying Envelope Approximation) solution of the ﬁeld propagation to a more accurate Generalized Few-cycle
Envelope Approximation (GFEA) [7, 8], but the utility of multiple ﬁeld components becomes questionable. In this
regime it can be advantageous to treat the ﬁeld as a single unit, rather than splitting it into pieces. Note that this
approach still diﬀers from solutions of Maxwell’s equations such as FDTD (ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain)[9] or PSSD
(pseudospectral spatial domain)[10], because our single-ﬁeld is based on a second-order wave equation, and uses a
convenient choice of carrier function to deﬁne a ﬁeld envelope.

Following these considerations, we now derive a single-ﬁeld model for Raman generation, and, apart from that
notable detail, follow an analogous path to that of Hickman, Paisner, and Bischel (HPB) [11]. In the model, we ﬁnd
that the coupling constants retain an oscillatory behaviour at the transition frequency, and that it is this that impresses
the sideband modulation on the propagating ﬁeld. Since the ﬁeld is not only wideband, but contains signiﬁcant
sideband components, we need to propagate this (no longer slowly varying) ﬁeld envelope using the GFEA. The
necessity of allowing for these can be demonstrated by converting the single-ﬁeld model into a multi-ﬁeld counterpart
– without the envelope-gradient corrections, we will not get a correct multi-ﬁeld model.

A. Summary of the theory and the numerical implementation

We model the wideband Raman generation process in the following way. We specify the ﬁeld frequencies (ωi) of
interest, which are usually at integer spacings of the transition frequency (ωA) from the main pump laser frequency
(ω0). Each of these ﬁeld components is described usin a standard envelope theory (i.e. as Ai(t)) with a time-history,
allowing us to simulate pulses as they travel through the Raman medium. The Raman medium is modelled as a

2

two-level atom using a (its) Bloch vector (u, v, w), and this Bloch vector is driven by each combination of spectrally
adjacent ﬁeld components (
v)
in combination with its pair of adjacent ﬁeld components (i.e. Ai−1, Ai+1).

AiA−1). Each of the ﬁeld components Ai is driven by the atomic polarization (

and wavevectors for the ﬁeld components, ∆ gives a rotating frame for ρ12 →

Additionally, a Cauchy dispersion is applied to the propagation of the ﬁeld components.
Because each of the ﬁeld components has a time-history, this translates to a spectral width. In typical cases with
roughly nanosecond pulse lengths, the bandwidth of each component will be tiny compared to the transition frequency,
so there will be large uneventful gaps in the total spectrum. In contrast, if the pulse lengths drop to (say) roughly
100 femtoseconds, the bandwidths of the ﬁeld components will form a noticeable fraction of the total spectrum

B. A comment on Cauchy dispersion

As regards the mismatch terms in the Raman model, Geoﬀ New has remarked (email, 20040121) that there’s a key
point about the γn’s that is not made properly in most of the McDonald et al publications; since it is usually said
rather enigmatically that the γ’s are ”parameterized” by γ1. The point is that if one assumes a Cauchy-type law for
the refractive index variation, all the gamma’s are linked by a recurrence relation, and so you only need to specify
one of them, from which all the others will follow. The point is made properly (to GN’s knowledge) only in ref [12].

II. SINGLE-FIELD WIDEBAND RAMAN

Note: This single ﬁeld derivation does mean some of the approximations as to the “slowness” of the ﬁeld variation seem
somewhat stringent. However, since a conversion to a multi-ﬁeld model is possible, it would seem the ﬁeld variation constraints
are less stringent than they would ﬁrst appear.

A. Coupled wavefunction equations

I start by considering the wave function ψ of a single molecule (e.g. H2) and the electric ﬁeld E, and write the
time-dependent wave function by expanding it in terms of the eigenfunctions in the ﬁeld-free (i.e. E = 0) case.
This means I can get the expansion coeﬃcients by solving for an eﬀective Schr¨oedinger equation that contains a
two-photon Rabi frequency created by means of an interaction term based on a ﬁeld-dependent dipole moment. I
assume a dispersionless medium and write all equations in terms of position z and retarded times t = tlab
z/c. Here
I follow the method of HPB [11], but use only a single E ﬁeld rather than multiple components. Note that HPB use
Gaussian units, so there can appear to be inconsistencies when comparing my formulae (in S.I.) to theirs.

This strand leaves the perturbing potential as a function of electric ﬁeld E, and does not replace it with a carrier-

Since we are only interested in the end states j = 1, 2, between which the Raman transition occurs, we only need
calculate c1, c2; however we still retain the sum over all i intermediates states, as they aﬀect the coupling between 1

Their frequency dependence is discussed after the following subsection; HPB’s corresponding parameters, which do

2. CASE (ii): Electric Field Envelope

This strand replaces the electric ﬁeld E with a carrier-envelope description, but, unlike HPB, I use only a single
carrier-envelope component rather than a set indexed by some integer j. This is necessary, because in the previous
strand I ended up with coupling constants αnj with strong frequency dependences.

These redeﬁned α′

nj parameters still oscillate, as they must because unlike in the HPB derivation, there is no
frequency diﬀerence between ﬁeld components to cancel with the Raman transition frequency. The coupling also
varies with frequency, which is discussed next.

B. Raman coupling parameters: approximations

I now discuss two particular (and vital) approximations applied to the Raman coupling parameters.
First, note that (as in HPB), I will take the indices 1 and 2 to correspond to the two states involved in the (Raman)
transition of interest; these will be the 0 and 1 vibrational (or perhaps rotational) levels of the electronic ground state.
Indices 3 and above will correspond to (quoting HPB) “translational motion on higher electronic states”.

Note: I can see that assigning these indices to higher electronic states will conveniently keep the energy separations
2 transitions, but it’s not so clear to me why I can ignore all the higher

for transitions to greater than that of the 1
vibrational (or rotational) states.

↔

Since I am interested only in the Raman transition, I specialise the above equations for the coeﬃcients cn, calculating
dipole moment is zero. This means we will only be including
c1 and c2 only, and assuming that the d12 =
transitions between indices 1 and 2 that go via one of the higher states j
3.
Further, I solve for the coeﬃcients for the higher states in terms of c1 and c2, in an adiabatic approximation justiﬁed
when c1 and c2 vary only slowly compared to the exponential terms.

Note: Separate from the oscillations that occur in my coupling parameters (but not in HPB), there is the issue of

frequency dependence which applies to both HPB and my parameters.

For both HPB (their eqn.(15)), and my ﬁeld-carrier based derivation (eqn.(2.1.35)), the presence of the ﬁeld carrier
in the denominator is helpful. Since it can reasonably be assumed to be much greater than the inter(Raman)-level

This is not in any way obviously (or even partially) true for the no-carrier E based (eqn.(2.1.18), αnj) parameters,
which depend only on the diﬀerence in Raman levels – at best you might perhaps hope that the denominators were
approximate multiples of each other.

2 and 1) have nearly the same amplitude. This approximation allows me to replace α′
12 in the w equation
below, which simpliﬁes my notation and makes the coupling term match that in the ρ12 equation, important in getting
to true Bloch equations.

3. Sum is cosine

I do not reduce the exponential sum to a (trig) cosine function, for potential use later when matching and/or

diﬀerencing exponentials. However, this sum is does not occur, so the ¯a12 is never used.

Ignoring the W21 transition frequency terms, this is just the diﬀerence in the energy shifts of the two levels with

ﬁeld intensity. This is a purely real quantity, with no imaginary part.

C. Two photon Bloch equations

From now on, I use I (a script “I”) to represent E2 if following on from II A 1 and eqns.(2.1.17, 2.1.18); or to
2 if following on from II A 2 and eqns.(2.1.34, 2.1.35). Since it is the envelope-carrier description of the

In the standard atom-ﬁeld case, the atom and ﬁeld frequencies are similar, so an atom carrier could be chosen to
match its evolution the ﬁeld carrier frequency, leading naturally to a detuning term. However, in the Raman situation,
the atomic frequency is far removed from the ﬁeld frequency, so the frequency evolution that appears in the deﬁnition
of ψ (eqn.(2.1.3)) is suﬃcient.

Here I deﬁne two things (a) new u, v variables that represent the density matrix element ρ12, and (b) allow for a

without a “+c.c.” since ρ12 is a complex quantity. There is no need for any kind of carrier+envelope transformation

Notice that we have made the ﬁxed complex phase (the δ′) vanish from the equations; this is not dependent on the

for I; however note that both give the same result.

Vj and Vj±1 will arise. Note the appearance (in HPB) of a carrier-dependent ωi term, which in a standard multi-ﬁeld
approach would lead to diﬀerent prefactors on the diﬀerent ∂ξAi equations.

2. Comments on the ﬁeld propagation

We can see that the derivative of A is proportional to ıA, hence the (time-domain) evolution just rotates each point
A(t) diﬀerently without changing its amplitude. This might seem to imply that we will never get a shorter pulse than
we put in; but note that the A is an envelope, and the ﬁeld is A + A∗, so that in principle the phase of A might be such
that its amplitudes cancel in certain t regions but not others, leading to a shorter pulse (and the magnetic ﬁeld H
also, since the ﬁelds are plane polarized). However, it seems unlikely that this will happen (barring some miraculous
coincidence) from purely Raman eﬀects.

If I can predict the output spectral phases though, a structure with a suitably designed dispersion might be able to
impose the desired phases. It would only be necessary to get the dispersion right at the comb points of the spectrum.
See Shverdin et.al. [16], who do a four-wave mixing optimization procedure in their experiment to match their phases
appropriately.

H. The steady state and gain co-eﬃcient

and we can assume that they are identical but for a factor of 2n2

0/ζ. I do not know whether SMN silently assumes

n0 = 1, or factors n0 into c. In any case n0 = 1 is usually accurate enough in gases.

However, one hidden complication with my above equation is that Ap includes both the center “pump” ﬁeld and
the Raman sideband we are amplifying – thus to properly check the gain co-eﬃcient, we should expand it into its
components, as is done below.

1. Pump and sideband calculation

Ap includes both fundamental A1 and its Raman sideband A2 = A′

2e−ıωbt. For the moment, I leave the calculation

in a rather abbreviated state – probably it should be shifted to the Multi-ﬁeld section following later. So

III. MULTI-FIELD VARIANT OF SINGLE-FIELD RAMAN THEORY

The single-ﬁeld Raman model above can be converted into a traditional multi-ﬁeld model as developed in e.g. HPB
[11] or Syed, McDonald and New [17] by replacing the ﬁeld envelope with a sum of multiple envelopes using carrier
exponentials spaced at the Raman frequency. When doing this, I will only get the correct multi-ﬁeld form if few-cycle

(2.8.18)

(either SEWA or GFEA) corrections to the ﬁeld evolution part of the theory are applied to the eﬀective polarization
caused by the Raman transition.

The idea is to replace the single ﬁeld envelope with a sum of multiple envelopes spaced at the Raman frequency,
which are best placed to represent the comb of frequencies generated by the Raman interaction. Note that it will not
necessarily be identical to HPB and/or SMN, because the ﬁeld equations are derived from a propagation equation
using a ω0, β0 carrier, but it will be very closely related.

Starting from eqns.(2.6.27,2.6.28), Since the single-ﬁeld evolution equation (eqn.(2.7.21)) uses an envelope A that
is based on a carrier (see eqn.(2.1.21)), the single-ﬁeld envelope A is replaced with Aj’s at frequency ωj = ω0 + jωb
with wavevector kj = k(ωj); thus ω′
k. The single-ﬁeld envelope in
terms of the new Aj’s is

Note the RWA’s above (for both polarization and inversion equations) discard modulations at frequency of multiples
of ωb. Quite a lot of physics has been removed by these RWA approximations, although it is very reasonable except in
the very wideband limit. For example, the eﬀect of next-nearest neighbour ﬁeld components acting on the transition
have been ignored, as have all more distant ﬁeld-ﬁeld interactions. In the next-nearest neighbour case, the dropped
terms would impose a rapid ωb oscillation onto the polarization ρ12, which would in turn tend to impose sidebands
at
It is reasonable to ignore such sidebands in the narrowband limit studied by
most users of a multi-ﬁeld Raman theory; but, in principle one might extend a multi-ﬁeld theory to include them by
inventing a scheme to apply the sidebands to the ﬁeld component they are (near) resonant with.

This is in agreement with both HPB[11] barring the opposite sign on the RHS – similar agreement occurs with

SMN[17] once I identify q = (v + ıu). Note that generally ∆ = 0, as it just controls a frame rotation for ρ12.

Note that we can assume, quite reasonably, that the multi-ﬁeld envelopes Aj will be better behaved than the
single-ﬁeld envelope A. However, we have made more approximations, notably by RWA’ing away all the oﬀ-resonant
cross terms driving the atomic transition so a multi-ﬁeld approach is not always better. These oﬀ-resonant terms are
at 2ω0 ±

ωb – see just prior to the starting point above of eqns.(2.6.25, 2.6.26).

IV. COMPARISONS

V. SUMMARY

I describe how to model a multi-frequency ﬁeld such as that seen in a wideband Raman generation experiment
using a single ﬁeld envelope rather than a set of envelopes, one at each Stokes or anti-Stokes frequency. This requires
that the ﬁeld be propagated taking into account wideband eﬀects, as described by either the SEWA theory of Brabec
and Krausz [18], or the more general GFEA of Kinsler and New [7].

The usefulness of this single-ﬁeld approach is not restricted to the Raman interaction described in this paper. It
would be equally valuable for a near-degenerate optical parametric oscillator, or indeed any system where any two or
more ﬁeld components contain spectra that start to overlap as the pump or probe pulses get shorter.

It is important to note that it will usually only be more eﬃcient to use a single-ﬁeld simulation if pump pulses are
very short, and eﬀects like the next-nearest neighbour ﬁeld interactions, neglected in the multi-ﬁeld theory, need to be
included, or if the extra computational overhead is not inconvenient. This is because in a single-ﬁeld simulation, a very
ﬁne time-resolution is necessary to model the polarization and ﬁeld oscillations closely enough to get good numerical
convergence. However, this situation improves when the Raman transition has a smaller frequency compared to the
pump pulse frequencies. One useful side eﬀect of the ﬁne time resolution is that it naturally gives a wide spectral
bandwidth, so that many Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are modeled quite naturally. Further, our single-ﬁeld model
could be invaluable in modeling a short pulse pump-probe experiment where the probe frequency does not match
any of the Stokes or anti-Stokes spectral lines generated by the pump pulse(s). A multi-ﬁeld simulation would then
need arrays for both the pump and probe Raman ‘ladders” of Stokes/anti-Stokes lines, and the role of next nearest
neighbour interactions (ignored in the multi-ﬁeld model) could well become more signiﬁcant.

18

In summary, the advantages of our single-ﬁeld approach are twofold. First, it includes more physics than the multi-
ﬁeld approach, even compared to a multi-ﬁeld approach enhanced by adding GFEA corrections to the propagation of
the ﬁeld components. Secondly, it deals eﬀortlessly with the complications of overlapping spectra in the multi-ﬁeld
case.

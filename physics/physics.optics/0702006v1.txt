Abstract

The negative shifts seen by Wang and Zhu are not due to the excitation of
surface plasmons but to leaky modes of the slab propagating backward. Provided
the characteristics of the LHM slab are chosen correctly, it is shown that a leaky
surface plasmon can actually be excited using the KR conﬁguration.

In a recent letter[1], Wang and Zhu studied the negative lateral shift of a beam
reﬂected by a thin slab of left-handed material (LMH) in the Kretschmann-Raether
(KR) conﬁguration. They claim that an “unusual standing wave” is responsible for
this negative shift, and that this standing wave “becomes a surface wave”. However,
the authors studied a structure in conditions that could in no way allow to excite
surface plasmons. For an interface between air and a LHM characterized by ǫ2 < 0
and µ2 < 0, a surface plasmon can exist[5, 6] provided (i) the propagation constant
α along the interface is greater than √ǫ2 µ2 k0 and k0, which means that the ﬁeld
< 1 and ǫ2 µ2 > 1 (this case
µ2
is evanescent in the two media and (ii) either
|
> 1 and ǫ2 µ2 < 1 (forward surface
µ2
corresponds to a backward surface wave) or
|
wave). The dispersion relation of the surface plasmon is given by

In their study of the KR conﬁguration, Wang and Zhu (i) have propagative
waves in the LHM medium since they take k0 < α < √ǫ2 µ2 k0 and (ii) have chosen
ǫ2 =
1. It is completely impossible to excite a surface wave in these

conditions.

We attribute the observed lateral shifts to leaky modes of the slab. It has been
shown that when a Fabry-P´erot resonance of the slab is excited by an incident beam
with an incidence angle θ
= 0, it gives birth to a leaky mode of the slab[3] although
this is not well known. Leaky modes are responsible for large lateral shifts[2, 3, 4].

In our case, the LHM slab supports a backward leaky mode[2], which explains why
the shift is found to be negative. The leaky mode can of course not be seen using
a plane wave analysis[2]. Figure 1 shows the result of our simulations : an incident
beam with an incidence angle of 37.8◦ is reﬂected by a LHM slab. The leaky mode
is clearly propagating towards the left and its amplitude is exponentially decreasing
in this direction. This result is both new and interesting, but no surface resonance
is involved in this phenomenon.

Let us now consider a conﬁguration for which a backward surface plasmon may
a priori be excited. We take ǫ1 = 12, µ1 = 1, ǫ2 =
0.5 and d = 0.6 λ.
No slab resonance can be excited in these conditions because the slab is too thin.
The lateral shift for this conﬁguration is represented ﬁgure 2. A very large negative
shift can be seen for θ
αp. This shift is even greater than in the
≃
case of slab resonances because the plasmon is less leaky and hence it propagates
further. Let us stress that the ﬁeld is evanescent in the LHM (√ǫ2 µ2 k0 < α) and
in the air so that this resonance is without any doubt a surface plasmon.

We came to the conclusion that the negative shifts seen by Wang and Zhu are
not due to the excitation of surface plasmons but to leaky modes of the slab[2, 3]
propagating backward - which is an interesting result. Provided the characteristics
of the LHM slab are chosen correctly, we showed it is possible to excite a leaky
surface plasmon[8] using the KR conﬁguration.

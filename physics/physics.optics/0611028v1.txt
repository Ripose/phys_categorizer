A stochastical description is applied in order to understand how ferroelectric structures can be
formed. The predictions are compared with experimental data of the so-called electrical ﬁxing:
Domains are patterned in photorefractive lithium niobate crystals by the combination of light-
induced space-charge ﬁelds with externally applied electrical ﬁelds.
In terms of our stochastical
model the probability for domain nucleation is modulated according to the sum of external and
internal ﬁelds. The model describes the shape of the domain pattern as well as the eﬀective degree
of modulation.

PACS numbers: 77.80,42.65.Hw

The importance of ferroelectric optical materials is still
contrasted by a lack of theoretical understanding. Com-
paring textbook knowledge with real experimental results
yields many discrepancies. Some examples for the promi-
nent ferroelectric materials lithium niobate and lithium
tantalate: Domain walls can be pinned and can bow [1],
the coercive ﬁeld can be reduced by an order of magni-
tude by small changes in the lithium content [2], and the
materials exhibit a memory eﬀect for recent domain in-
versions [3]. The reason that it is so hard to predict and
to model ferroelectric domain inversion and patterning
results from the inﬂuence of defects (vacancies, impuri-
ties, ions on wrong lattice sites, etc.). The systems are
too large to make ﬁrst-principle calculations that con-
sider these eﬀects, although ﬁrst attemps already yield
impressive fundamental predictions [4].

The simplest periodic structure, that is ideally suited
to compare theoretical and experimental data, is an el-
ementary grating. Such periodically poled crystals are
also of relevance for a variety of applications: Frequency
conversion [5], parametric oscillation [6], the generation
of terahertz radiation [7] as well as high-speed electro-
optical switching [8]. Conventional periodic poling is
achieved by applying high electrical ﬁelds with structured
electrodes [9]. However, quality and size of domain struc-
tures fabricated by this method seem to be limited. The
reasons are not clear because of insuﬃcient theoretical
modelling

One possibility to describe ferroelectric domain rever-
sal is the theory of Avrami, Kolmogorov, Johnson, and
Mehl on ﬁrst-order phase transitions adapted by Seki-
moto to a form usable for our purposes [10, 11]. This
theory relys on a purely stochastical description. Ac-
cording to it, domains nucleate and grow independently
from each other, and within its framework the probabil-
ity for domain inversion can be calculated. Usually the
domain switching is studied by obtaining the time depen-
dence of the inverted volume fraction during the poling
process. It is an open and demanding question whether

this theory can be applied to domain patterning as well.
In the present work electrical ﬁxing [12, 13, 14, 15]
is used to compare stochastical modelling of domain pat-
terning to experimental data: Space-charge ﬁelds are cre-
ated in a crystal via the photorefractive eﬀect [16], and
additionally an external electrical ﬁeld is applied. Ac-
cording to the stochastical model a spatially modulated
electrical ﬁeld leads to a modulated probability for do-
main inversion. The dependence of the domain grating
quality on the underlying probability density can be cal-
culated by adapting the theory of Avrami, Kolmogorov,
Johnson, and Mehl to the case of a spatially sinuosoidally
modulated probability for domain nucleation. Sekimoto
[11] gives the following general formula for the probability
w that a point ~r has an inverted spontaneous polariza-
tion:

Here I(~r′, t′) denotes the probability density for domain
nucleation at position ~r′ and time t′ and V denotes the
whole crystal volume. The function D(~r, t; ~r′, t′) is zero if
such a domain contains ~r at time t and is one otherwise.
The time dependence in D and I is introduced to model
the temporal evolution as domain nucleation probability
and domain sizes may vary with time. As we are not
interested in the temporal evolution here, we replace the
time dependence by the dependence on domain length l .
Thus it follows:

Here I(~r′, l′) is the probability that a domain located at
~r′ with length l′ can be found.

We now assume that due to a periodic space-charge
grating the probability for domain nucleation is periodi-
cally modulated. Thus we write:

I(~r′, l

Here nl(l′) describes the size distribution of domains.
So β/α is a measure for the strength of the inﬂuence

of the space-charge grating on domain nucleation. Here
K = 2π/Λ is the spatial frequency of the space-charge
grating. The domain shape is assumed to be cylindrical
with length 2l and area A(l) and to be centered around
~r′ which is described by the function D . Instead of a
modulated probability for domain nucleation, a modu-
lated domain-wall growth can be assumed by adapting
I(~r′, l′) . However, within the framework of our methods
both assumptions lead to very similar predicitions, hence
the latter is not investigated within this article. Insert-
ing equation (2) into equation (1) and using the speciﬁc
domain form, we get:

whereas κ = η/γ measures the modulation degree of the
domain grating (0 ≤ κ ≤ 1). Expanding the second ex-
ponential function in the last expression for w up to the
ﬁrst order we get as an approximate expression for w:

w(~r) = 1 − [1 − γκ sin (Krz)] exp (−γ) .

The area fraction q with inverted spontaneous polariza-
tion (degree of poling) can be found by taking the spatial
average of w(~r):

q =

dz q(z) = 1 − exp (−γ) .

The degree of modulation of the domain grating ∆q can
be calculated as the ﬁrst Fourier coeﬃcient for K:

∆q = γκ exp(−γ) = −κ(1 − q) ln(1 − q) .

(3)

Equation 3 expresses the domain grating modulation
solely as a function of the degree of poling. For no or com-
plete reversal of the spontaneous polarization no grating
at all can be found. A maximum is found in between. Nu-
merically evaluating equation 3 for several assumptions
yields that for the height of the curve max ∆q ≈ 0.4κ
roughly holds.

To test these predictions experimentally, electrical ﬁx-
ing experiments are performed. Lithium niobate crystals
doped with 0.05 mol% iron from Deltronic Crystal Indus-
tries are used. To reduce the coercive ﬁeld a vapor trans-
port equilibration treatment is applied [17]. The crystals
are put into a special mount which is placed in a glass bin
ﬁlled with silicon oil to prevent electrical breakdowns.

The optical setup consists of a detuned Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, which allows to illuminate the crystal
with a periodic interference pattern with grating peri-
ods of 5 to 100 µm. Light of the wavelength 488 nm from

2

an Argon-ion laser is used. The illumination creates a
space-charge ﬁeld which induces an index-of-refraction
grating via the electro-optic eﬀect. This photorefractive
volume grating is detected by Bragg-diﬀraction with light
of the wavelength 633 nm from a HeNe-laser. From the
amount of diﬀracted light the amplitude of the modu-
lation of the index-of-refraction and hence of the space-
charge ﬁeld can be calculated [18]. A detailed description
of the setup can be found in reference [19].

The experiments are performed as follows: A space-
charge ﬁeld is written by illuminating the crystal with
an interference grating. Either during or after the record-
ing a voltage is applied to the crystal along the z-axis.
The polarity of the voltage is chosen such that the elec-
trical ﬁeld supports domain inversion. The strength of
the space-charge ﬁeld is monitored during the whole ex-
.
periment. When the space-charge ﬁeld reaches steady
state, the illumination is stopped and the external elec-
trical ﬁeld is shut oﬀ. After homogeneous illumination
of the crystal no diﬀracted light is detected. Next the
crystal is repoled to its single-domain state by applying
an electrical ﬁeld without any illumination. The degree
of poling is determined by integrating the current during
the poling process. This value is normalized by twice the
spontaneous polarization PS.

The revealed index-of-refraction grating provides in-
formation about the achieved degree of modulation of
the domain walls.
It is studied for diﬀerent strengths
and application times of the external ﬁeld during the
recording process.
In Fig. 1 the revealed space-charge
grating strength is plotted against the degree of poling.
In Fig. 1 (a) a space-charge ﬁeld is written in the crys-
tal before the external ﬁeld is applied. The experimental
parameter, which is varied, is the time this ﬁeld is ap-
plied.
In Fig. 1 (b) the space charge grating is written
in the presence of an externally applied ﬁeld. Here the
recording time is ﬁxed but in order to change the degree
of poling the external ﬁeld is varied.

As can be seen, the strength of the revealed ﬁeld be-
comes zero for q → 0 as well as for q → 1 and reaches a
maximum in between. In Fig 1 (a) the dependence of the
strength of the reappearing space-charge ﬁeld is shifted
to higher q-values compared to the results obtained with
varying ﬁelds in Fig. 1 (b).

Comparing theoretical predicitions with experimental
data for the strength of the revealed ﬁeld under dif-
ferent ﬁxing conditions, qualitative agreement can be
found. The dependence on the degree of poling q with
diﬀerent writing times as in Fig. 1 (a) is very close to a
−(1 − x)ln(1 − x) dependence as predicted by Eq. (3).
The shift to lower q-values, when the ﬁeld is varied, is
understandable: Diﬀerent external ﬁelds do not only in-
ﬂuence q but also change the relative inﬂuence of the
space-charge ﬁeld and thus β/α.

Experimental data for diﬀerent grating periods is
shown in Fig. 2. For period lengths smaller than 15 µm
the strength of the reappearing space-charge ﬁeld quickly
drops to zero. However, for large period lengths exceed-

FIG. 2: The index-of-refraction modulation ∆n is plotted ver-
sus the period length Λ of the ﬁxed grating. To correct for dif-
ferent degrees of poling, ∆n was divided by −(1 − q) ln(1 − q)
(e.g. Eq. (3)). The curve is the product of a ﬁt parame-
ter A and the caluclated κ, which determines the degree of
modulation ∆q. A Gaussian distribution is assumed for the
distribution of domain lengths.

FIG. 1: The index-of-refraction modulation ∆n is plotted ver-
sus the degree of poling q. The period Λ of the ﬁxed grating
is Λ = 15.7 µm. In Fig. 1 (a) the degree of poling is varied by
applying an external electrical ﬁeld for diﬀerent times. The
solid line is a plot of Eq. (3) where κ is a ﬁt parameter. In
Fig. 1 (b) diﬀerent external ﬁelds are applied for a constant
time. The dashed line is a guide to the eye.

ing 40 µm saturation is obvious.

Fig. 2 not only shows the measured strengths of the
revealed index-of-refraction grating for diﬀerent period
lengths Λ, but also a calculation of the degree of modu-
lation. Here assumptions on the domain size distribution
have to be made: A Gaussian distribution centered at 0
with a width of 5 µm is assumed. The height of the plot-
ted curve is used as a ﬁt parameter. The basic message is
that if a broad domain size distribution is assumed, as it
is found in real crystals by the PFM measurements, the
model predicts that no revealed grating should be found
for period lengths smaller than the length of most of the
domains. For higher period lengths the grating quality
increases. These predictions are in agreement with mea-
sured data.

To check whether a space-charge grating is revealed
all over the crystal or only in some parts of it, the index
grating induced by the space-charge ﬁeld is imaged with
diﬀerential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) after
repoling the crystal. This method allows to detect very
small gradients of the index-of-refraction in the crystals.

FIG. 3: A revealed grating is imaged with the diﬀerential
interference contrast method. The period length Λ of the
electrically ﬁxed grating is 9.6 µm. The z-axis is aligned hor-
izontally.

We use this as a method to observe restored space-charge
ﬁelds and to determine qualitatively the shape of ﬁxed
domain gratings. This is possible because after repol-
ing of the crystal uncompensated charges appear at the
former domain walls. These charges cause electro-optic
index changes which are a replica of the original domain
pattern [13]. Figure 3 shows the result. As it can be seen,
the grating reappears all over the crystal.

Piezoelectric force microspcopy (PFM) is used to di-
rectly image the ferroelectric domain structure after elec-
trically ﬁxing a space-charge grating. The PFM is a

4

model. The degree of modulation is too small to be ob-
vious from direct domain visualization, but an average
periodicity is visible which can be detected by the help
of light diﬀraction at the revealed space charge grating.

After revealing, local ﬁelds are created according to the
former domain structure. Typical values of such ﬁelds
Eloc presumably are determined by material parameters,
as the spontaneous polarization and ﬁeld-limiting eﬀects
like the electric-breakdown ﬁeld. The Eloc form a corre-
sponding index-of-refraction grating via the electro-optic
eﬀect which is detected by diﬀraction of a light beam.
The eﬀective, averaged ﬁeld Eeﬀ , which is measured by
this method, is given by the modulation degree multi-
plied by the local electric ﬁeld Eloc. Thus theoretical
predictions for ∆q link a material dependent factor Eloc
with the experimental value Eeﬀ , i.e., these values are
proportional to each other.

Alltogether it is found that the predictions of the model
are in agreement with all available experimental data, in-
dicating strong support for the model presented herein.
None of the assumptions of the theory is speciﬁc to the
material lithium niobate. So the stochastic description
oﬀers a general way to analyze and discuss experimen-
tal dependences in all electrical ﬁxing experiments which
have been performed in a large variety of ferroelectric
materials. For Example in Ref. [21] the same dependence
of revealed grating strengths on the degree of poling and
the same dependence on the grating period Λ is found
for electrical ﬁxing in barium titanate crystals.

Furthermore,

the stochastical description enables
quantitative predictions. Provided better knowledge of
local ﬁelds after revealing is gained, the factor β/α, i.e.
the inﬂuence of local ﬁelds on the poling dynamics, can
be analyzed. This is a point which is hard to access by al-
ternative means. As the inﬂuence of defects presumably
can be described by local ﬁelds, deeper understanding of
ferroelectric domain switching becomes possible.

scanning force microscope operated in contact mode with
an additional alternating voltage applied to the tip [20].
In piezoelectric samples this voltage causes thickness
changes and therefore vibrations of the surface which lead
to oscillations of the cantilever that can be read out with
a lock-in ampliﬁer. In the present work we imaged the
non-polar faces of LiNbO3.

The faces of the crystal are polished down stepwise
by some hundred micrometers to ensure that volume do-
mains are visualized. Figure 4 shows that ferroelectric
volume domains can be found after electrical ﬁxing of
holograms in lithium niobate crystals. However, a peri-
odic structure is not immediately evident. In fact, the
length of some areas with inverted spontaneous polariza-
tion are bigger than one period of the ﬁxed grating.

However, from the PFM images we conclude that elec-
trical ﬁxing indeed leads to ferroelectric volume domains
with inverted spontaneous polarization in head-to-tail
conﬁguration, but the periodicity is not evident locally.
The DIC images suggest that averaged over the whole
crystal thickness a well deﬁned grating is present. Both
observations are consistent with the predictions of the

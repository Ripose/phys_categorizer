We show that when a narrow beam is incident upon a dielectric interface near the critical angle
for total internal reﬂection it will be transmitted into the far-ﬁeld with an angular deﬂection from
the direction predicted by Snell’s Law, due to a phenomenon we call “Fresnel Filtering”. This eﬀect
can be quite large for the parameter range relevant to dielectric microcavity lasers.

A promising approach to making high-Q optical micro-
cavities and micro-lasers is to base them on totally-
internally reﬂected modes of dielectric microstructures.
This approach is currently under intense investigation
with resonators and lasers based on a range of shapes:
disks, cylinders, spheres [1], deformed cylinders and
spheres [2–7] squares [8] and hexagons [9]. Many dif-
ferent mode geometries have been observed in such res-
onators, e.g. whispering gallery modes [1], bow-tie modes
[2,3], triangle [6,7] and square modes [8]. Typically these
modes correspond to ray trajectories which are incident
on the boundary of the resonator above or at the critical
angle in order to achieve adequately high Q-values and
may correspond to periodic ray “orbits” (POs) which are
either stable, unstable or marginally stable. The natu-
ral and simplest method for predicting how such a mode
will emit or scatter light is simply to apply Snell’s law
to the underlying ray orbit and follow the refracted ray
into the far-ﬁeld. For a ray which is incident at the criti-
cal angle this would imply emission in the direction tan-
gent to the emission point. However in several recent
experiments very large deviations from this simple ex-
pectation were observed [2,7]. We show below that such
observations may be explained as arising from the an-
gular spread in the resonant mode around the PO, and
the very rapidly varying transmission probability as a
function of angle near the critical angle. This “ﬁlters”
out the angular components which are totally internally
reﬂected (TIR) and preferentially transmits those which
are far from TIR, leading to a net angular rotation of the
outgoing radiation from the tangent direction. We call
this eﬀect Fresnel Filtering (FF).

The basic eﬀect occurs for a bounded beam of arbi-
trary cross-section incident from a semi-inﬁnite medium
of index n into vacuum, although it will be quantitatively
altered in a resonator due to the curvature and/or ﬁnite
length of the boundary. We thus begin with the inﬁnite
planar example, which we can solve analytically, before
presenting numerical results for quadrupolar asymmetric
resonant cavities (ARCs) [10]. There is a large litera-
ture on reﬂection of a beam from a dielectric interface
near or above the critical angle, as the reﬂected beam
exhibits the Goos-H¨anchen lateral shift as well as other

1

“non-specular” phenomena [11]. However only a few of
these works address the transmission [12,13] of the beam
and these tend to focus on the evanescent eﬀects in the
near ﬁeld; none appear to have identiﬁed the Fresnel Fil-
tering eﬀect and its relevance to dielectric micro-cavity
resonators.

For simplicity, we consider a two-dimensional planar
interface which separates two semi-inﬁnite regions with a
relative dielectric constant n. Consider a beam Eiα inci-
dent from the denser region with a central incidence angle
θi. We will take the beam to be gaussian with a mini-
mum beam waist w (which we will use to scale all lengths
henceforth) at a distance zo from the interface. The basic
eﬀect is independent of the nature of the input beam as
long as it is focused and has signiﬁcant angular spread.
The corresponding Snell emission angle θe (which is in
general complex) is given by n sin θi = sin θe.
Si : (xi, zi)
and
Se : (xe, ze) refer to coordinates tied to the incident
and refracted beams respectively (see Fig. 1 inset). We
will consider linearly polarized beams, the correspond-
ing beam ﬁelds Eα, α = T M, T E, will then denote the
electric (T M ) or the magnetic (T E) ﬁelds normal to the
plane of incidence.

Using the angular spectrum representation [14], the
incident beam in
Si coordinates will consist of a super-
position of plane waves of the same frequency ω with
a gaussian distribution of transverse wavevectors nkos,
where s = sin ∆θi, ko = ω/co is the wavevector in vac-
uum and ∆θi is the deviation angle of the plane wave
component from θi:

The relevant saddle point arises from setting to zero the
derivative of the cosine in the exponent of Eq.
(2); this
saddle point value selects the angular component which
refracts into the observation direction φ by Snell’s law.
However the amplitude factor obtained by gaussian in-
tegration around the saddle point shifts the maximum
of the outgoing beam away from the Snell direction. As
noted, the eﬀect occurs for narrow beams with an ar-
bitrary (non-gaussian) wavevector distribution
(s); in
such a case the factor
(so) in Eq. (4) is replaced by
(s0) (see e.g. ref. [7]).
Eq. (4) gives the angular beam proﬁle in the far-
ﬁeld, which is non-zero for any incident angle θi, even
(1/n). The key point is that the angu-
θi > θc = sin
lar maximum of this outgoing beam, φmax, is in gen-
eral not at the angle θe predicted by applying Snell’s
law to the central incident beam direction θi . Instead,
due to the unequal transmission of the diﬀerent angu-
lar components, the beam direction is shifted by an an-
gle ∆θF F corresponding to less refraction than expected
from Snell’s law. This angular deﬂection can be quite
large for incidence near θc in typical microcavity res-
onators; in Fig. 1 the dashed line is the result of Eq. (4)
for critical incidence, for which the Snell angle is φ = 90◦,

Two technical points are in order here: First, while
deforming the contour of integration in Eq. (2) to the
steepest descent path, depending on how θi, θc and φ
are situated, one might intercept branch cuts due to the
branchpoints s =
θc). Such
1 and s =
branchpoint contributions are well-studied for the re-
ﬂected beam shifts [15,16], but the contribution is sub-
dominant with respect to the ﬁrst order asymptotic term
derived in Eq. (4); we neglect such terms here. Second,
there is another saddle point ˜so = cos(θi) which cor-
responds to angular components with grazing incidence
to the interface. Because the Fresnel transmission fac-
tor vanishes for such components ˜s0 only contributes to
(ρ−3/2). This contribution only
the integral at order
becomes important very near φ = π/2, where the dom-
inant contribution from s0 also vanishes, and again we
neglect such terms in the current work.

Clearly the same Fresnel Filtering eﬀect will occur in
emission from dielectric resonators with a magnitude sim-
ilar to the planar case when the typical radius of curva-
ture is much larger than w. As an example, we inves-
tigate the eﬀect of FF on the farﬁeld emission pattern
of quadrupolar ARCs [10,6,2,7], dielectric cylinders with
cross-section given by r(φw) = ro(1 + ε cos 2φw). We

study the exact numerically generated quasibound TM
modes of a resonator with 10% (ε = 0.1) deformation
for diﬀerent values of the refractive index n, focusing on
resonances based on the stable four-bounce (“diamond”)
PO. The numerical method used is a variant of the “S-
matrix method” for billiards [17,18]. If, as in this case,
the relevant orbit is stable and we neglect leakage, then it
is possible to construct [19] approximate modes which are
piecewise gaussian on each segment of the PO. From this
theory one ﬁnds that the eﬀective beam waist in each seg-
ment will scale as ∆ = ξ√nkoro, where ξ is a constant
dependent only on the stability matrix eigenvectors of
that particular segment, and ko is the quantized eigen-
value of the mode. In Fig. 2 (a) we plot one represen-
tative quasi-bound mode at n = 1.56; the corresponding
far-ﬁeld angular intensity is plotted in Fig. 1.

gaussian theory of this diamond resonance, hence we have
no free parameters. The observed diﬀerence is likely due
primarily to the eﬀect of the curvature of the boundary.
To evaluate systematically the Fresnel Filtering eﬀect,
we have calculated the farﬁeld peaks of the set of diamond
resonances while varying the index of refraction, so that
the critical angle is scanned through the PO incidence
39◦. In order to remain as close as possible
angle θi ≈
to our GM with ﬁxed ∆ we have chosen the resonances
so that nkoro is approximately constant. In Fig. 3, the
exact numerical resonance peak is compared to the cal-
culated φmax from Eq. (4) and to the direction predicted
by Snell’s law. Clearly the deviation from Snell’s law,
∆θF F , varies with distance from θc; further studies ﬁnd
that this region of signiﬁcant deviation decreases with
increasing ∆ as expected.

FIG. 2. (a) Field intensity plot (gray-scale) for a diamond
resonance of the quadrupole at critical incidence for the points
at φw = 0, π, calculated numerically at nkoro ≈ 90, n = 1.56,
ε = 0.1. Note that there is negligible emission from the up-
per and lower bounce points at φw = ±90◦ because they are
above the critical angle (b) Chiral counterpart of this exact
resonance, simulating a gaussian beam (see text).

In both ﬁgures one sees the rapid oscillations due to
interference, but in Fig. 1 one can see that the maximum
of the intensity is displaced from φ = 90◦ as expected due
to Fresnel Filtering. To compare the size of the eﬀect to
our analytic theory for a planar interface it is convenient
to eliminate the interference by calculating the “chiral”
resonance shown in Fig. 2 (b). This is the original reso-
nance with the negative angular momentum components
projected out, hence mimicking a uni-directional beam.
When this is plotted in Fig. 1 (dot-dashed line) it gives
the smooth envelope of the diamond resonance without
the oscillations. We can regard this chiral resonance as a
beam incident at φw = 0 on the boundary and compare
it to our planar model. The angle of incidence of the
39◦,
“beam” with respect to the tangent plane is θi ≈
and we have chosen n so that θi = θc; hence naive ray
optics predicts tangent emission (φmax = 90◦). From
Fig. 1 one sees that the resonance emission is peaked at
66◦, whereas the planar model gives a similar
φmax ≈
62◦. In evaluating
envelope slightly shifted with φmax ≈

In conclusion, we have shown that the transmission
direction of a narrow beam through a plane dielectric in-
terface can be quite diﬀerent from the direction predicted
by applying Snell’s law to the incident beam direction.
This eﬀect is due to a phenomenon we call Fresnel Filter-
ing and is of great importance in predicting the emission
patterns from resonances based on periodic ray orbits in
micro-cavity lasers. This is true even when the size of the
resonator r0 is much larger than the wavelength and one
might have expected ray optics to be quite good. Speciﬁ-
cally the eﬀective beam waist for stable resonances scales

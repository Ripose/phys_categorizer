It is shown that a system of two coupled planar material sheets possessing surface mode (po-
lariton) resonances can be used for the purpose of evanescent ﬁeld restoration and, thus, for the
sub-wavelength near-ﬁeld imaging. The sheets are placed in free space so that they are parallel and
separated by a certain distance. Due to interaction of the resonating surface modes (polaritons)
of the sheets an exponential growth in the amplitude of an evanescent plane wave coming through
the system can be achieved. This eﬀect was predicted earlier for backward-wave (double-negative
or Veselago) slab lenses. The alternative system considered here is proved to be realizable at mi-
crowaves by grids or arrays of resonant particles. The necessary electromagnetic properties of the
resonating grids and the particles are investigated and established. Theoretical results are supported
by microwave experiments that demonstrate ampliﬁcation of evanescent modes.

INTRODUCTION

Negative refraction and sub-wavelength resolution in
slab lenses based on backward-wave (also called double-
negative or Veselago1) materials are the topics that have
been widely discussed in the recent literature. The
discussion started soon after Pendry had published his
article2 claiming a possibility to overcome the λ/2 opti-
cal resolution limit using a slab of Veselago material with
the relative parameters ǫr =
1. The re-
sult came out of the discovery that a Veselago slab1 can
“amplify” exponentially decaying evanescent modes of a
source ﬁeld. The slab restores the amplitudes of these
modes in the image plane recovering the ﬁne details of a
source.

It was no wonder that many scientists, especially those
from the optical community, found this idea of “ampli-
ﬁcation” diﬃcult to accept.3 Indeed, if one assumes an
exponential growth of the ﬁeld amplitude in a slab of a ﬁ-
nite thickness, it seems that increasing the slab thickness
the amplitude of the outgoing ﬁeld can be made arbitrar-
ily high. However, an accurate analysis shows that if the
slab relative permittivity and permeability are not exact
1 (due to inevitable losses and dispersion) that cannot
−
happen.
Indeed, for a slab of thickness d of Veselago
material characterized by ǫr, µr the slab transmission
coeﬃcient can be found using the standard procedure of
expressing the slab ﬁelds in terms of two oppositely prop-
agating (decaying) waves and ﬁnding the unknown wave
amplitudes by solving a system of four equations coming
from the boundary conditions on the slab interfaces. For
excitation by an evanescent plane wave with the tangen-
tial component of the propagation factor kt we have

of (1) when the slab thickness and (or) the incidence ﬁeld

region where the evanescent ﬁelds are indeed ampliﬁed
in a Veselago slab is limited by several factors. Some of
them are even inevitable in any realistic material, e.g.,
losses and spatial dispersion.4

For the following, it is important to understand what
main phenomena lead to ampliﬁcation of evanescent
modes in the Veselago slab. For this purpose, we will
shortly review the plane wave incidence problem for an
interface of free space and a half-space ﬁlled by a Vese-
lago material. In the material we will look for a solution
which, as usually, is either exponentially decaying (if the
transmitted wave is evanescent) or transmitting energy
from the interface (if the wave is propagating).

If A, B, and C denote the complex amplitudes of the
incident, transmitted, and reﬂected wave electric ﬁeld
tangential components, respectively, then using the in-
terface boundary conditions we can write:

A + C = B

Here η0 and η are the wave impedances that connect the
tangential components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in

In a Veselago medium both ǫr and µr are negative.
In the same time, kn is also negative because the prop-

interesting comes out of (3) in this case except that when
1 the interface is perfectly matched: η = η0,
ǫr = µr =
C = 0, B = A.

But let us suppose that the incident and transmit-
ted waves are evanescent. Then, η = jωµ0µr/α for TE
waves, and η = α/(jωǫ0ǫr) for TM waves. Because the
transmitted wave must decay from the interface, α is pos-
itive. We see that for evanescent modes the ideal case

Based on similar considerations several authors5,6 ex-
plained the evanescent mode ampliﬁcation in the Pendry
lens as the result of resonant excitation of a pair of cou-
pled surface modes (polaritons) sitting at the slab inter-
faces. Under certain conditions the polariton excited at
the second (output) interface is much stronger than that
excited at the ﬁrst interface. The exponentially decay-
ing trail of the polariton sitting at the output interface
appears as an exponential growth of the ﬁeld inside the
slab.

The eﬀects taking place in the material depth (back-
ward waves) and the properties of the slab interfaces (po-
lariton resonances) both contribute to the Pendry’s lens
operation. However, it can be shown that in general the
presence of a bulk material layer is not crucial. Concep-
tually, if one can realize a planar sheet such that travel-
ing waves refract negatively when crossing this sheet, a
system of two such sheets placed just in free space will
focus the propagating modes of a source just like a Vese-
lago slab.
If the sheets also support surface waves for
all kt > k0, then such system will posses surface polari-
ton resonances reconstructing the evanescent spectrum
as well. We found in our recent paper7 that a system
of two phase conjugating interfaces in air behaves as a
perfect lens. A possible drawback of phase conjugating
design is the necessity to utilize non-linear eﬀects like
wave mixing.
In this paper we will discuss alternative
possibilities to evanescent spectrum reconstruction not
involving non-linearity. The design will be based on the
principle mentioned above: We will make use of a cou-
ple of polariton-resonant surfaces or grids placed in free

2

space. No bulk backward-wave materials will be involved,
providing more ﬂexibility and less limitations in design.

II. ANALYSIS BASED ON TRANSMISSION
MATRICES

In this section and in what follows we restrict our con-
sideration by the evanescent spectrum only. Our purpose
here will be to ﬁnd such conditions on resonating sheets
that lead to “ampliﬁcation” of the evanescent modes in
the proposed double-grid system. We will call the sys-
tem simply as device. A possible name for such a device
can be near-ﬁeld lens, but we would prefer not to use
word lens in this context to avoid misunderstanding. Let
us emphasize that our aim here is the restoration of the
near-ﬁeld or evanescent ﬁeld picture of a source. The sys-
tems to be considered in the following do not focus prop-
agating modes. This can be done by other well-known
optical means.

×

We will make use of a powerful method based on so-
called 2
2 wave transmission matrices, well known in
the microwave circuit theory.8 These matrices connect
the complex amplitudes of waves traveling (or decaying)
in the opposite directions in a waveguiding system or
a system where one can determine the principal axis of
propagation and measured at two reference planes:

spectively (we restrict ourselves by planar layered struc-
tures and plane waves). The signs ± correspond to the
signs in the propagator exponents e±jknz of these waves,
and z is the axis orthogonal to the interfaces (the main
axis of the system).
It is known that the T-matrix of
a serial connection of several devices described by their
T-matrices is simply a multiplication of the matrices in
the order determined by the connection.

Our purpose is to build a theoretically ideal near-ﬁeld
imaging device. Hence, the total transmission matrix
from the source plane to the plane where the source ﬁeld
distribution is reconstructed must be the identity matrix

for every spatial harmonic of the source ﬁeld. Here,
Tsp before and Tsp after represent the air layers occupying
the space between the source plane and the device, and
the space between the device and the image plane. Tdev
is the transmission matrix of the device. From this for-
mula it is obvious that a complete reconstruction of the
ﬁeld distribution in the source plane at a distant image
plane must involve phase compensation for the propagat-
ing space harmonics and “ampliﬁcation” for the evanes-

6
cent ones. In other words, one needs to synthesize a de-
vice that somehow inverts the action of a free-space layer.

sheets7 operate as such device. In this paper we will ﬁnd
other linear solutions working for the evanescent ﬁelds of
a source.

Let us note here that condition (5) is a strict condition
requiring not only the one-way transmission to be such
that it reconstructs the source ﬁeld picture at the image
plane, but also the matching to be ideal (no reﬂections
from the device) and the device operation to be sym-
metric (reversible in the optical sense). We will consider
some less strict conditions later.

Let us suppose that the source and the image planes
are distanced by d/2 from the input and the output in-
terfaces of the device. A space layer of thickness d/2 has
the T-matrix

To compensate the action of two such layers before and
after the device and satisfy the condition (5), the device
T-matrix Tdev has to be, obviously, the inverse of the
transmission matrix of these space layers:

Let us study if a device modeled by this transmission
matrix can be realized as a combination of two “ﬁeld
transformers” (e.g., thin sheets of certain electromagnetic
properties) separated by a layer of free space, like it was
discussed in the introduction. This system is modeled by
the transmission matrix

However, let us consider a couple of simpler systems
also, resulting from the conditions less strict than (5).
We keep the same operation principle deﬁned by (8). If
we allow a mismatch at the device interfaces still main-
taining the device symmetry, the following solution can
be found:

Here, Tin and Tout are matrices with yet unknown com-
ponents describing the two sheets or layers forming the
device, and Tsp(d) is the matrix of the free-space layer
between the sheets. It is easy to show that if a = d = 0,
e = h = 0, and bg = cf = 1, then the total device T-
matrix takes form (7), i.e., it is the necessary matrix of a
perfect lens. From the mathematical point of view such
an amazing result is simply an eﬀect of permutation of
the matrix components under the multiplication (8). The
physical question which we will need to answer later is
how to realize an interface with a T-matrix of the form

One can see that the device is matched for the waves
coming to the ﬁrst interface (s11 = 0) and also “ampli-
ﬁes” the evanescent modes. In the next section we will
describe the ways to realize matrices (9), (10), and (13).

III. THE USE OF IMPEDANCE SHEETS

(cid:18)
We will show that even this ultimate case is realizable
(for excitation by evanescent ﬁelds) by passive grids with
speciﬁc electric and magnetic susceptibilities.

(cid:19)

At ﬁrst we consider a simple system: a lossless isotropic
grid, e.g., a conductive wire mesh (possibly loaded by cer-
tain bulk reactances inserted in every cell). If the grid
supports only electric currents, and there is no eﬀective

magnetic current induced on the grid, then the grid re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient R and transmission coeﬃcient T at the
grid plane are related as

T = 1 + R

(16)

provided that they are deﬁned through the electric ﬁeld
tangential components (for a given polarization). The
corresponding T-matrix of such a grid is

(17)

It is possible to make grids supporting propagation of
surface modes (also known as slow waves in radio engi-
neering). For wire meshes, for example, this phenomenon
is well investigated.10 If the tangential component of the
wave vector of an incident wave coincides with the prop-
agation factor of a surface mode, the surface mode res-
onance takes place. Obviously, the incident wave should
be evanescent in this case to match with the propagation
constant of the surface mode. At a surface mode reso-

(cid:19)
which is of the necessary form (10).

(cid:18)

For a better understanding we reformulate the con-
sideration above in terms of the grid impedance. If the
boundary condition on the grid is given as Et = ZgJ,
where J is the averaged electric surface current density
induced on the grid, Et is the averaged tangential electric
ﬁeld in the grid plane, and Zg is the grid impedance, the
reﬂection coeﬃcient can be found as9

grid or array possessing the necessary resonance for some
value(s) of kt.

We can see from (20) that it is enough to change the
sign of the grid impedance to realize the second matrix
in (13). Such grid is not at resonance with the incident
evanescent ﬁeld, and it works as an additional matching
layer or a load for the output grid which must experience
a strong resonance in accordance with (13).

Let us now consider a more complicated grid or array
that supports both electric and magnetic currents. We
suppose that the electric current is excited by electric
ﬁelds in the array plane and the magnetic current is due
to magnetic ﬁelds at the same plane. In the presence of
two currents, the tangential components of both electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are not continuous across the inter-
face:

E1

E2 = Jm, H1

H2 = Je

(22)

where Je and Jm stand for the averaged electric and mag-
netic surface current densities. The following conditions
determine the current amplitudes in terms of two grid
impedances Ze and Zm:

(23)

(18)

It is possible to show that an interface deﬁned by the
above conditions has the following T-matrix:

Eq. (20) is a particular case of (24) when Zm tends to
zero and the magnetic current vanishes. The matrix (24)
reduces to form (9) in two cases. First, this happens when
the electric subsystem is at resonance: Ze =
η0/2 and
the magnetic subsystem works as a loading: Zm = 2η0.
In this case

Or, second, when the roles are interchanged: Ze = η0/2,

which is the dispersion equation for surface modes on the
grid surface. Because η0 is purely imaginary for evanes-
cent modes (it is inductive for TE waves and capaci-
tive for TM waves) one can see that in principle there
are no restrictions on realizing a capacitive or inductive

Let us note again that nothing forbids realization of the
necessary impedances for a given kt, because for the
evanescent modes they are purely imaginary.

IV. ARRAYS OF WEAKLY INTERACTING
RESONANT INCLUSIONS

In the previous sections we have shown that the surface
mode resonance plays the key role in the mechanism of
the evanescent ﬁeld ampliﬁcation. We also have proven
that such resonance is possible to realize in a passive
grid or array. The resonance occurs when the (ω, kt)
pair belongs to the polariton spectrum of the grid.

Practically speaking, this means that for a given fre-
quency ω one may realize one or at most several resonant
values of the transverse propagation constant kt. It can
be enough for some purposes as, for example, for reso-
nant extraction and “ampliﬁcation” of a certain spatial
harmonic of the incident ﬁeld. However, for a device op-
erating as a near ﬁeld lens one should provide as wide
range of operable kt as possible.

Mathematically (and ideally), the last means that the
dispersion equation (21) should be somehow turned at
a given frequency into an identity for any kt > k0. Al-
though that is impossible in practice, there is a good
approximation for this. Let us consider a dense regu-
lar two-dimensional array of small resonant dipole inclu-
sions. Instead of writing the boundary condition in terms
of the total averaged ﬁeld in the array plane as before,
we may solve the excitation problem directly in terms of
the external ﬁeld and the induced dipole moments.
In
a given external ﬁeld Eext, the dipole moment of each
particle in the array is9

p = χ(ω)

Eext + β(ω, kt)p

(27)

h

i

Here χ is the particle polarizability, and β(ω, kt) is so-
called interaction factor, which is a function of kt. Obvi-
ously, the solution for the induced dipole moment is

Eext

p =

1

β(ω, kt)

χ(ω) −

5

Comparing the last relation with the resonance condi-
tion (21) we see that the polariton resonance takes place
when Zc = 0. Of course, the same conclusion follows
directly from looking at the denominator of (28).

The imaginary parts of 1/χ and β cancel out in a
lossless non-radiating array9 (we work with evanescent
In order to resonate at all harmonics of the
ﬁelds).
evanescent ﬁeld spectrum, the resonant condition Zc = 0
must be satisﬁed for all kt. Because the inclusions are as-
sumed to be small dipole particles, their polarizability χ
depends on the frequency, but does not depend on kt. On
the other hand, the interaction constant β depends both
on the frequency and on the transverse wave number.
Thus, the only possibility to realize such grids using small
inclusions is to use resonant particles (Re
0) and
minimize the ﬁeld interactions between the particles in
the array (provide Re β(ω, kt)
0). If these conditions
are satisﬁed, each particle in the grid is excited locally
by the incident ﬁeld at its position (if the ﬁeld interac-
tion in the array is negligible, the local ﬁeld equals the
incident ﬁeld). Since at the operational frequency the
particles are at resonance, arbitrary spatial distributions
of the incident ﬁeld will excite a resonance of the whole
array. In other words, at this frequency the grid indeed
supports polaritons with arbitrary kt > k0, as needed for
evanescent ﬁeld ampliﬁcation and imaging.

1/χ

In a real system particles always interact, and the last
condition cannot be exactly satisﬁed. However, it is pos-
sible to reduce or compensate interactions at a certain
frequency. In the next section we will describe an experi-
ment based on implementing an array of highly resonant
but weakly interacting particles. The experiment will
demonstrate evanescent ﬁeld enhancement in a passive
linear system. Another possibility is to use inclusions of
larger sizes, and try to compensate the spatial dispersion
of the particle interaction with the spatial dispersion of
the response of one inclusion. We will not explore this
last possibility in this paper.

From here it is already seen what condition is needed for
a resonance, but let us proceed a bit further. In terms
of the average surface current density J = jωp/S0 (S0 is
the unit cell area) we write

ZcJ = Eext,

V. EXPERIMENT

In the microwave experiment (the operating frequency
was close to 5 GHz), evanescent ﬁelds were generated
in the space between a metal plate and a dense mesh of
conducting strips forming a two-plate waveguide, see Fig-
ure 1. Microwave absorbers were used around the system
to minimize reﬂections from the open ends of the waveg-
uide. The upper screen was made weakly penetrable to
the ﬁelds in order to give us a possibility to measure
the ﬁeld distribution by a probe positioned on top of
the mesh. The transmission coeﬃcient of this mesh (for
normal plane-wave incidence) at the operation frequency
was about
20 dB. As a source, we used a wire dipole
antenna whose length was close to λ/4. The dipole was
parallel to the conducting plates, so that only evanescent
modes were excited in the space between the plates (the
distance between the plates was 2.5 cm, so that all the

FIG. 3: The distribution of evanescent ﬁeld created by a small
dipole antenna in the presence of two small resonant particles.
The source dipole is placed at x = −125 mm, y = 55 mm and
directed along the y-axis. Two metal particles (Figure 2) are
placed at x = −105 mm, y = 55 mm and x = −65 mm,
y = 55 mm. The particles are oriented along the y-axis. The
frequency is 5 GHz. The probe is 0.5 cm away from the top
mesh of the setup. The ﬁeld amplitude scale is linear.

FIG. 2: Small resonant particle.

As was established above, to realize a device that
would “amplify” evanescent ﬁelds we need to design an
array of small resonant particles that weakly interact. To
validate this concept, one can minimize interactions be-
tween particles simply increasing the distance between
the particles in the array.
In our ﬁrst experiment, we
measured ﬁelds in a system of only two resonant parti-
cles, which corresponds to the case of two parallel arrays
with inﬁnitely large periods. The particles were made of
a copper wire of 0.8 mm diameter, and their shape and
dimensions were as shown in Figure 2. The wire was me-
andered in order to make the overall dimensions small
as compared with the wavelength. The stretched wire
length was close to λ/2, so the particles showed resonant
response.

The experimental results are shown in Figures 3 and
4. It can be seen that, as expected from the theory, the
ﬁrst particle is very weakly excited, and a high-amplitude
plasmon polariton is sitting at the second particle. The
ﬁeld amplitude in the “image plane” is close to that at
the source position.

Although this experiment demonstrates the validity of
the main principle of near-ﬁeld enhancement and a pos-
sibility to restore the evanescent ﬁeld components, grids
with reasonably small periods are necessary to realize an
imaging device.

axis for the same arrangement as in Figure 3. This is a side
view of the 3D-plot of the ﬁeld distribution shown in Figure 3.
The key positions on the plot are indicated by arrows.

To study phenomena in such grids, we have made mea-
surements in a system of two regular arrays of similar par-
ticles. The array geometry is shown in Figure 5. In this
system, the ﬁeld interaction of particles exists, meaning
that maintaining polariton resonance for all transverse
wave numbers is not possible. In the measurements, we
ﬁrst experimentally determined the eigenfrequencies of
the grids. Each eigenfrequency corresponds to a certain
transverse wavenumber kt. Next, we exited the grids

reconstruct the near-ﬁeld image of a source. All these
structures result from the idea of using a system of two
parallel polariton-resonant grids or arrays separated by
a certain distance and placed in free space.

The physics behind this idea is based on the known
behavior of coupled resonant systems.
If in a system
of two resonators the ﬁrst resonator is pumped by an
external force and the second resonator is coupled to the
ﬁrst one, then under certain conditions it is possible for
the amplitude of oscillations in the second resonator to
be much higher than the amplitude of the external ﬁeld
and the amplitude of the ﬁrst resonator oscillations. A
similar interpretation of the phenomena taking place in
a coupled-polariton-resonant system (the Veselago slab)
can be found in a recent work by Rao and Ong.6

The present paper continues of the research we started
in order to eliminate the need in backward-wave or
other exotic bulk material layers in the design of near-

that a system of two phase-conjugating planes or sheets
placed in free space behaves as a perfect lens proposed by
Pendry.2 The obvious drawback of the phase-conjugating
design is the necessity to involve nonlinear materials or
devices in the structures realizing the conjugating sheets.
Here we have shown that if the focusing of the propagat-
ing spectrum is not required there exist several linear
solutions.

We have developed a general synthesis approach based
on the wave transmission matrices8 to ﬁnd the conditions
under which a system of two coupled polariton-resonant
grids or arrays enhances incident evanescent ﬁeld. Next,
the inner design of the grids has been revealed, and it has
been shown that there are many possibilities arising from
the use of impedance sheets. The necessary structures
can be realized as arrays of weakly interacting resonant
particles of diﬀerent nature.

We have experimentally conﬁrmed the possibility to
use passive linear polariton-resonant systems for evanes-
cent ﬁeld enhancement at microwaves. The experiment
supports the main concepts of our theoretical ﬁndings.
The resonant growth of the evanescent ﬁelds coming
through the system has been observed.

FIG. 6: The distribution of evanescent ﬁeld created by two
small dipole antennas in the presence of two grids of small
resonant particles. The ﬁeld complex values are measured
at 5.15 GHz (1st polariton resonance) and 5.26 GHz (2nd
polariton resonance) and summed up. Two source dipoles
are placed at x = −125 mm, y = 20 mm and at x = −125
mm, y = 90 mm. The dipoles are oriented along the y-axis.
Two grids (5 particles in each) are placed at x = −105 mm,
y = 55 mm and x = −65 mm, y = 55 mm along the y-axis.

at each of these frequencies (2 frequencies were practi-
cally used) and superimposed the measured spatial pro-
ﬁles. This corresponds to reconstructing the source spa-
tial spectrum using only a few spatial harmonics. The
result for the case of excitation by two small dipole an-
tennas is shown in Figure 6. Strong excitation of the
second grid is clearly visible, as well as an image of the
source ﬁeld behind the grids. This last experiment should
be considered as a ﬁrst step only, because no eﬀective
reduction of the ﬁeld interactions between the grid parti-
cles was realized, and the set-up had many non-idealities.
However, we can conclude that the experiments success-
fully validate the principle of near-ﬁeld enhancement in
simple passive and linear resonant systems.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have considered a wide class of passive
linear structures able to enhance evanescent ﬁelds and

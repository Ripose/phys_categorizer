Abstract

It is noted that the Jones-matrix formalism for polarization optics is a six-
parameter two-by-two representation of the Lorentz group. It is shown that
the four independent Stokes parameters form a Minkowskian four-vector, just
like the energy-momentum four-vector in special relativity. The optical ﬁlters
are represented by four-by-four Lorentz-transformation matrices. This four-
by-four formalism can deal with partial coherence described by the Stokes
parameters. A four-by-four matrix formulation is given for decoherence eﬀects
on the Stokes parameters, and a possible experiment is proposed. It is shown
also that this Lorentz-group formalism leads to optical ﬁlters with a symmetry
property corresponding to that of two-dimensional Euclidean transformations.

I. INTRODUCTION

There are two standard mathematical devices in polarization optics. One is the Jones-
matrix formalism [1], and the other is the set of four Stokes parameters [2,3]. They are
well-established languages in optics. In our earlier papers [4,5], we have shown that the two-
by-two Jones-matrix formalism is basically a two-by-two representation of the six-parameter
Lorentz group, and the Jones vector is like the two-component spinor. This formalism allows
us to use all the convenient theorems in the Lorentz group and allows us also to use optical
polarizers as analog computers for the Lorentz group used in other branches of physics.

It is often more convenient to use the set of four numbers called the Stokes parameters.
Then it is natural to write down four-by-four matrices for optical ﬁlters. The purpose of this
paper is to study the parameters and the four-by-four matrices as entities in the Lorentz
group. We shall show that the Stokes parameters can be grouped into a Minkowskian four-
vector and the four-by-four matrices are like Lorentz transformation matrices applicable to
the four-dimensional space-time.

Unlike the Jones vector, the Stokes parameters can deal with the degree of coherence
In the language of the two-by-two coherency
between two orthogonal polarization axes.
matrix [6], the lack of coherence appears as a decrease in the magnitude of the oﬀ-diagonal
elements. We shall study this decoherence eﬀect in detail and propose an experiment to test
a Lorentz eﬀect which is mathematically equivalent to the Thomas eﬀect in atomic spectra.
For this purpose, we start with the Stokes parameters for a purely coherent case. We then
study the modiﬁcation needed to deal with partially coherent polarized waves. For the purely
coherent case, it is possible to construct a set of the Stokes parameters from the Jones vectors.
This process is like constructing a four-vector from a pair of spinors. It is also possible to
construct four-by-four ﬁlter matrices from the two-by-two Jones matrices. Thus the four-
by-four matrices applicable to the four Stokes parameters form another representation of
the six-parameter Lorentz group.

It is a simple matter to write down the Stokes parameters for reduced coherence.
If
this reduced coherence is preserved, the ﬁlter matrices are still the four-by-four matrices
represented by the six-parameter Lorentz group. However, if the optical ﬁlters reduce co-
herence, this creates an entirely new problem. In order to deal with this case, we introduce
a four-by-four “decoherence” matrix.

This new matrix is not a member of the Lorentz group, and creates a new matrix algebra.
Fortunately, the four-by-four decoherence matrix can be reduced to two two-by-two matrices.
One of them squeezes the ﬁrst and the fourth Stokes parameters, and the other two-by-two
matrix performs a two-dimensional symplectic transformation on the second and third Stokes
parameters. This is quite like a Lorentz transformation in one time-like dimension and two
space-like. Thus, two repeated decoherence matrices can produce a Lorentz eﬀect similar to
the Thomas eﬀect observed in atomic spectra. This is an observable eﬀect.

In this paper, we combine various existing mathematical devices for polarization optics
into a single formalism based on the Lorentz group. This process leads to some new concepts
which can be observed in laboratories. The new concepts are decoherence matrices and new
optical ﬁlters.

In Sec. II, we construct the two-by-two Jones-matrix formalism and the Stokes param-
eters starting from a polarized light wave. Section III summarizes our earlier papers on
the Jones-matrix formalism as a representation of the Lorentz group. In Sec. IV, we show
that the Stokes parameters are transformed as a Minkowskian four-vector through coherence
preserving ﬁlters.

In Sec. V, we show how a Minkowskian four-vector is constructed from two spinors. It
is noted that there are two diﬀerent sets of spinors for the case of the Lorentz group, and
this distinction is responsible for the diﬀerence between electrons and positrons. It is shown
how the light wave and its complex conjugate correspond to the electron and positron
respectively.
In Sec. VI, we compare the Jones vectors and the Stokes parameters, and
explain why the four-vector representation of the Stokes parameters contain more physics

2

than the Jones-matrix formalism. It is noted in Sec. VII that the Stokes four-vector can
accommodate polarized waves with partial coherence. We present in this section a matrix
formulation of decoherence eﬀects, and derive a measurable consequence.

In Sec. VIII we discuss physical implications of the procedure outlined in this paper,
using a concrete physical example. In Appendix A, the Lorentz group is discussed in terms
of Lorentz transformations applicable to the four-dimensional Minkowskian space. The two-
dimensional Euclidean group is used in our discussion of possible new optical ﬁlters. We
explain this group in terms of translations and rotations on a ﬂat plane in Appendix B.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

In studying polarized light propagating along the z direction, the traditional approach is
to consider the x and y components of the electric ﬁelds. Their amplitude ratio and the phase
diﬀerence determine the degree of polarization. Thus, we can change the polarization either
by adjusting the amplitudes, by changing the relative phases, or both. For convenience,
we call the optical device which changes amplitudes an “attenuator” and the device which
changes the relative phase a “phase shifter.”

Let us write these electric ﬁelds as

Ex
Ey (cid:19)

(cid:18)

=

A exp {i(kz − ωt + φ1)}
B exp {i(kz − ωt + φ2)} (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

where A and B are the amplitudes which are real and positive numbers, and φ1 and φ2 are
the phases of the x and y components respectively. This column matrix is called the Jones
vector. The content of polarization is determined by the ratio:

B
A (cid:19)
which can be written as one complex number:

Ey
Ex

=

(cid:18)

ei(φ2−φ1).

with

w = reiφ

r =

B
A

,

φ = φ2 − φ1.

The degree of polarization is measured by these two real numbers, which are the amplitude
ratio and the phase diﬀerence respectively. The transformation takes place when the light
beam goes through an optical ﬁlter whose transmission properties are not isotropic.

In dealing with light waves, we have to realize that the intensity is the quantity we
measure. Then there arises the question of coherence and time average. We are thus led to
consider the following parameters.

S11 = < E∗
S12 = < E∗

xEx >,
xEy >,

S22 =< E∗
S21 =< E∗

y Ey >,
y Ex > .

Then, we are naturally invited to write down the two-by-two matrix:

3

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

C =

< E∗
< E∗

xEx > < E∗
xEy > < E∗

y Ex >
y Ey > (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

where < E∗
matrix [6].

i Ej > is the time average of E∗

i Ej. The above form is called the coherency

It is sometimes more convenient to use the following combinations of parameters.

S0 = S11 + S22,
S1 = S11 − S22,
S2 = S12 + S21,
S3 = −i (S12 − S21) ,

These four parameters are called the Stokes parameters in the literature [2,3].

The purpose of the present paper is to show that these four parameters form a
Minkowskian four-vector when the light wave goes through optical ﬁlters. Once the four
Stokes parameters are introduced, it is quite natural to construct a four-dimensional vector
and transformation matrices applicable to this vector. These four-by-four matrices are called
Mueller matrices [2]. In this paper, we shall therefore show that the Mueller matrices are
like four-by-four Lorentz transformation matrices.

G. G. Stokes was an active researcher during the 19th Century [2]. The mathematics of
the Stokes parameters is a very old science, and there are many interesting mathematical de-
vices. For instance, we can deﬁne a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system spanned
by S1, S2, S3. We can then consider a sphere whose maximum radius is S0. This is called
the Poincar´e sphere and is the standard geometrical language for the Stokes parameters [6].
We shall use the geometry of this sphere in Secs. VI and VII of this paper.

III. JONES-MATRIX FORMALISM

We presented in our earlier papers [4], the Jones-matrix formalism as a representation
of the Lorentz group. We used there the concept of squeeze transformations to describe
attenuation ﬁlters. Let us summarize in this section the Lorentz-group content of this
formalism which will be useful for discussing the Stokes parameters.

There are two transverse directions which are perpendicular to each other. The absorp-
tion coeﬃcient in one transverse direction could be diﬀerent from the coeﬃcient along the
other direction. Thus, there is the “polarization” coordinate in which the absorption can be
described by

e−η1
0

(cid:18)

0
e−η2

(cid:19)

= e−(η1+η2)/2

eη/2
0

(cid:18)

0
e−η/2

(cid:19)

with η = η2 − η1 . This attenuation matrix tells us that the electric ﬁelds are attenuated
at two diﬀerent rates. The exponential factor e−(η1+η2)/2 reduces both components at the
same rate and does not aﬀect the degree of polarization. The eﬀect of polarization is solely
determined by the attenuation matrix

A(0, η) =

eη/2
0

(cid:18)

0
e−η/2

.

(cid:19)

4

(2.5)

(2.6)

(3.1)

(3.2)

This type of mathematical operation is quite familiar to us from squeezed states of light and
from Lorentz boosts of spinors. We call the above matrix the “attenuator.”

Another basic element is the optical ﬁlter with diﬀerent values of the index of refraction

along the two orthogonal directions. The eﬀect of this ﬁlter can be written as

eiδ1
0

(cid:18)

0
eiδ2

(cid:19)

= e−i(δ1+δ2)/2

e−iδ/2
0

(cid:18)

0
eiδ/2

,

(cid:19)

with δ = δ2 − δ1 . In measurement processes, the overall phase factor e−i(δ1+δ2)/2 cannot
be detected, and can therefore be deleted. The polarization eﬀect of the ﬁlter is solely
determined by the matrix

P (0, δ) =

e−iδ/2
0

(cid:18)

0
eiδ/2

.

(cid:19)

This form was noted as one of the basic components of the Jones-matrix formalism in Sec. II.
This phase-shifter matrix appears like a rotation matrix around the z axis in the theory of
rotation groups, but it plays a diﬀerent role in this paper. We shall hereafter call this matrix
a phase shifter.

The polarization axes are not always the x and y axes. For this reason, we need the

rotation matrix

R(θ) =

cos(θ/2) − sin(θ/2)
sin(θ/2)

cos(θ/2) (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

If the polarization coordinate is rotated by an angle θ/2, the attenuator and phase-shifter
of Eq.(3.2) and Eq.(3.4) respectively become

A(θ, η) = R(θ)A(0, η)R(−θ)

eη/2 cos2(θ/2) + e−η/2 sin2(θ/2)
(eη/2 − e−η/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)

=

(cid:18)

(eη/2 − e−η/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)
e−η/2 cos2(θ/2) + eη/2 sin2(θ/2) (cid:19)

,

(3.6)

P (θ, δ) = R(θ)P (0, δ)R(−θ)

e−iδ/2 cos2(θ/2) + eiδ/2 sin2(θ/2)
(e−iδ/2 − eiδ/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)

=

(cid:18)

(e−iδ/2 − eiδ/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)
eiδ/2 cos2(θ/2) + e−iδ/2 sin2(θ/2) (cid:19)

.

(3.7)

The Jones-matrix formalism consists of repeated applications of the three basic opera-
tions. In order to study this more systematically, let us use the generators of these trans-
formations. First, the rotation matrix of Eq.(3.5) takes the form:

and

with

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.8)

(3.9)

R(θ) = exp (−iθJ2),

J2 =

1
2 (cid:18)

0 −i
i

0 (cid:19)

.

5

with

with

with

with

The attenuation operator of Eq.(3.2) can also be written in the exponential form:

A(0, η) = exp (−iηK3),

(3.10)

K3 =

i
2 (cid:18)

1
0
0 −1 (cid:19)

.

If we take the commutation relation between the above generators, we end up with

another generator:

[J2, K3] = iK1,

(3.11)

0 1
1 0 (cid:19)
We are then led to write the commutation relations:

K1 =

i
2 (cid:18)

.

[K3, K1] = −iJ2,

[K1, J2] = iK3.

(3.12)

These three generators indeed form a closed set of commutation relations. The three-
parameter groups generated by this set of commutation relations are O(2, 1), Sp(2, r), and
SU(1, 1). The group SU(1, 1) has been extensively discussed in the literature in connection
with squeezed states of light [7]. The group O(2, 1) is the Lorentz group applicable to one
time-like dimension and two space-like dimensions. The group Sp(2, r) is the basic symme-
try group for the Wigner function for one-mode squeezed states [7,8]. The relevance of this
group in polarization optics has also been noted in the literature [4,9,10].

The phase-shifter of Eq.(3.4) can be written as

If we take a commutation relation of this operator with J2,

P (0, δ) = exp (−iδJ3),

J3 =

1
2 (cid:18)

1
0
0 −1 (cid:19)

.

[J3, J2] = iJ1,

J1 =

1
2 (cid:18)

0
1

1
0 (cid:19)

.

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

These three generators satisfy the commutation relations

[Ji, Jj] = iǫijkJk.

(3.16)

This set of commutations relations is very familiar to us. They generate the three-
dimensional rotation group and the SU(2) group governing rotational symmetry of spin-1/2
particles. These are also three-parameter groups.

6

If we apply both attenuators and phase-shifters in random order in laboratories, the
corresponding mathematics is to combine the two three-parameter groups by mixing up
their commutation relations. The resulting closed set of commutation relations consists
of [4]

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk,

[Ki, Jj] = −iǫijkJk,

(3.17)

in addition to the set given in Eq.(3.16).

These are the six generators for the two-by-two representation of the Lorentz group
which is often called SL(2, c). This group is the standard language in elementary particle
physics dealing with spin-1/2 particles. In optics, the Lorentz group gained its prominence
recently in connection with squeezed states of light [7]. It is quite natural for us to study
the two-by-two Jones matrices and four-by-four Mueller matrices within the framework of
the Lorentz group.

IV. TRANSFORMATION PROPERTIES OF THE STOKES PARAMETERS

In order to study the eﬀect of each ﬁlter, let us note that the eﬀect of the attenuator of

Eq.(3.2) on the incoming light of Eq.(2.1) is

The eﬀect of the phase shifter of Eq.(3.4) on the incoming light of Eq.(2.1) is

eη/2Ex
e−η/2Ey (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

e−iδ/2Ex
eiδ/2Ey (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

The eﬀect of the rotation matrix of Eq.(3.5) on the incoming light wave is

(cos(θ/2))Ex − (sin(θ/2))Ey
(sin(θ/2))Ex + (cos(θ/2))Ey (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

Under the rotation of Eq.(3.5) which transforms the incoming wave of Eq.(2.1) to

Eq.(4.3), S11 and S22 become

and

(S11 − S22) −

(S12 + S21) +

(S11 − S22) +

(S12 + S21) +

(S11 + S22),

respectively. It is clear from these expressions that (S11+S22) is invariant under this rotation.
As for (S11 − S22), the rotation leads to

cos θ(S11 − S22) − sin θ(S12 + S21).

Under the same rotation, S12 and S21 become

respectively. Thus (S12 − S21) remains invariant, while (S12 + S21) becomes

We can thus write the eﬀect of the rotation as

sin θ(S11 − S22) + cos θ(S12 + S21).

cos θ − sin θ
sin θ

cos θ (cid:19) (cid:18)

S11 − S22
S12 + S21 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Under the phase-shift transformation of Eq.(3.4) which leads to Eq.(4.2), S11 and S22

remain invariant, while S12 and S21 become eiδS12 and e−iδS21. The result is

cos δ − sin δ
sin δ

cos δ (cid:19) (cid:18)

S12 + S21
−i(S12 − S21) (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

Under the squeeze transformation of Eq.(3.2) which leads to Eq.(4.1), S11 and S22 become
eηS11 and e−ηS22 respectively, while S12 and S21 remain unchanged. This can be translated
into

Thus in terms of the Stokes parameters given in Eq.(2.6), we can write the above three

transformations as

S11 + S22
S11 − S22 (cid:19)

commutation relations.

These three Ki generators satisfy the commutation relations

[Ki, Kj] = −iǫijkJk.

The right-hand side of the above expression is not Ki but Ji. Thus, in order to get a closed
set of commutators, we have to take commutation relations between Ji and Ki. The result
is

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk.

Thus the six matrices consisting of three J and three K matrices form a closed set of a
group of transformations applicable to four-dimensional space.

If the above transformation group is applied to the four-dimensional space-time coordi-
nate (t, z, x, y), it becomes the group of Lorentz transformations in the Minkowskian space.
In deriving the above three sets of commutation relations, we have not used any of the
principles of special relativity. The commutation relations are derived strictly from the
properties of the optical ﬁlters. The Stokes parameters have nothing to do with special
relativity. Yet, it is remarkable that they can be formulated in terms of the mathematics of
Lorentz transformations.

V. SPINORS AND FOUR-VECTORS IN THE LORENTZ GROUP

We are now confronted with the question of why the Stokes parameters have to behave
like a Minkowskian four-vector. For this purpose, let us go back to Sec. III and consider
repeated applications of the three basic operations. We shall see ﬁrst whether the two-by-
two matrix algebra of Sec. III can be represented as a representation of the six-parameter
Lorentz group. We shall then investigate whether the four-by-four matrices of Sec. IV can
be systematically obtained from the Jones matrices.

For this purpose, let us start with the three Pauli spin matrices of the form

0 1
1 0 (cid:19)
Then, the rotation generators

σ1 =

(cid:18)

,

σ2 =

0 −i
i

0 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

σ3 =

0
1
0 −1 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

satisfy the closed set of commutation relations of Eq.(4.19).

We can also construct three boost generators

Ji =

σi

Ki =

σi,

1
2

i
2

which satisfy the commutation relations given in Eq.(4.21). The Ki matrices alone do not
form a closed set of commutation relations, their commutation relations with the rotation
generators are given in Eq.(4.22).

The six matrices Ji and Ki form a closed set of commutation relations, and they are like
the generators of the Lorentz group applicable to the (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space.
The group generated by the above six matrices is called SL(2, c) consisting of all two-by-two
complex matrices with unit determinant.

In order to construct four-vectors, we need two diﬀerent spinor representations of the
Lorentz group. Let us go to the commutation relations for the generators given in Eqs.(4.19),
(4.21) and (4.22). These commutators are not invariant under the sign change of the rotation
generators Ji, but are invariant under the sign change of the squeeze generators Ki. Thus,
to each spinor representation, there is another representation with the squeeze generators
with opposite sign. This allows us to construct another representation with the generators:

˙Ji =

σi,

˙Ki =

1
2

−i
2

σi.

We call this representation the “dotted” representation.

There are therefore two diﬀerent sets of Lorentz transformation matrices. If we write

In both of the above matrices, the Hermitian conjugation changes the direction of rota-
tion. However, it does not change the direction of boosts. We can achieve this only by
interchanging L to ˙L, and we shall call this the “dot” conjugation.

Likewise, there are two diﬀerent sets of spinors. Let us use u and v for the up and down
spinors for “undotted” representation. Then ˙u and ˙v are for the dotted representation. The
four-vectors are then constructed as [11]

u ˙u = −(x − iy),
u ˙v = (t + z),

v ˙v = (x + iy),

v ˙u = −(t − z).

The relation between the SL(2, c) spinors and the four-vectors has been discussed in
It is possible to construct the four-vector with the four SL(2, c)

spinors [12,14]. Indeed,

− u ˙u = (1, i, 0, 0),
u ˙v = (0, 0, 1, 1),

v ˙v = (1, −i, 0, 0),
v ˙v+ = (0, 0, 1, −1).

It is possible to construct a six-component Maxwell tensor by making combinations
of two undotted and dotted spinors [12]. For massless particles, the only gauge-invariant
components are uu and ˙v ˙v [15]. They correspond to the photons in the Maxwell tensor
representation with positive and negative helicities respectively. It is also possible to con-
struct Maxwell-tensor ﬁelds only for a massive particle, and obtain massless Maxwell ﬁelds
by group contraction [16].

where u and ˙u are one if the spin is up, and are zero if the spin is down, while v and ˙v are
zero and one for the spin-up and spin-down cases. The transformation matrix applicable to
the column vector in the above expression is the two-by-two matrix given in Eq.(5.5). What
is then the transformation matrix applicable to the row vector ( ˙v, − ˙u) from the right-hand
side? It is the transpose of the matrix applicable to the column vector ( ˙v, − ˙u). We can
obtain this column vector from

where the superscript T means the transpose of the matrix. The transformation matrix
applicable to the column vector of Eq.(5.10) is ˙L of Eq.(5.6). Thus the matrix applicable to
the row vector ( ˙v, − ˙u) in Eq.(5.9) is

This is precisely the Hermitian conjugate of L.

Let us now consider its transformation properties. The matrix of Eq.(2.5) is like

where the set of variables (x, y, z, t) is transformed like a four-vector under Lorentz trans-
formations. Furthermore, it is known that the Lorentz transformation of this four-vector is
achieved through the formula

where the transformation matrix L is that of Eq.(5.5). The construction of four-vectors from
the two-component spinors is not a trivial task [11,16]. The two-by-two representation of
Eq.(5.14) requires one more step of complication.

We are not the ﬁrst ones to suspect that the coherency matrix behaves like a four-vector.
This was done by Barakat in 1963 [17]. However, Sec. V shows that we need two diﬀerent
two-by-two representations of the Lorentz group to establish the connection between the
Jones vectors and the Stokes parameters in a covariant manner. The two diﬀerent spinors
are the column vectors of (u, v) and ( ˙u, ˙v).

This paper allows us to associate these spinors as

The symmetry between the dotted and undotted representations is responsible for the
electron-positron symmetry in the Dirac equation [12]. It is interesting to note that this
symmetry is applicable also to the polarization vectors of Eq.(5.16) and Eq.(5.17).

VI. JONES SPINORS AND STOKES VECTORS

The Jones vector is a two-component vector in the conventional formalism. Since, how-
ever, it is like a spinor in the Lorentz group, we call it hereafter the Jones spinor. The Jones
spinor and the Stokes four-vector are two diﬀerent representations of the same Lorentz group.
Why do we construct two diﬀerent representations? The diﬀerence is in physics.

Since the four-vector contains more elements than the two-component spinor, the Stokes
vector should give more information than the Jones spinor. This is translated into the

12

invariance properties of Stokes parameters. As the four-scalar (t2 − z2 − x2 − yz) is invariant
under Lorentz transformations, the quantity

S2 = S2

0 − S2

1 − S2

2 − S2
3

(6.1)

remains invariant under ﬁltering processes discussed in this paper. We shall hereafter call
this quantity “Stokes scalar.” If the Stokes Scalar is zero, the system is completely coherent.
This scalar quantity is positive if the system is partially coherent.

Indeed, this degree of coherence is what the Stokes vector can tell while the Jones spinor
cannot. If the ﬁlter system leaves the Stokes scalar invariant, it is a coherence-preserving
system. This quantity is not preserved if the ﬁlters cause random variations of phases.
The best way to describe this degree of coherence is to construct a Poincar´e sphere in the
three-dimensional space of S1, S2 and S3. The radius of this sphere is

R =

1 + S2
S2

2 + S2
3

1/2

.

(6.2)

(cid:17)
Then the ratio R/S0 gives the degree of coherence.

(cid:16)

This radius takes the maximum value S0 when the system is completely coherent, and it
takes the minimum value of S1 when the system is completely incoherent. In this minimum
case, both S2 and S3 vanish. The question then is whether there is a four-by-four matrix
which reduces these two components. If so, how can this matrix be augmented to the set of
transformation matrices discussed in Sec. IV?

VII. DECOHERENCE MATRICES

Let us go back to the four-by-four representation of Sec. IV. For the Stokes four-vector,
we can translate the two-by-two attenuator Eq.(3.2) applicable to the Jones vector into the
four-by-four matrix

Likewise, the phase-shifter of Eq.(3.4) is translated into

The introduction of the above matrix into the existing set of six generators of the Lorentz
group leads to the ﬁfteen parameter group of O(3, 3) or SL(4, r) [18], and this is beyond the
scope of the present paper. This however does not prevent us from looking for an interesting
subgroup which will play the key role in accommodating the decoherence matrix into the
four-by-four matrix formalism for the Stokes parameters.

It is interesting to see that this decoherence matrix commutes with the attenuator of
Eq.(7.1) and the phase-shifter of Eq.(7.2), but it does not commute with the rotator of
Eq.(7.3). Thus, the complication is reduced to the non-commuting algebra of this rotation
matrix and the decoherence matrix. As is given in Eq.(4.16), the generator of R(θ) of
Eq.(7.3) takes the form

In order to see the physics of these matrices, let us go to the Poincar´e sphere of this
system. In the three-dimensional space with the three Cartesian coordinate variable S1, S2
and S3, rotations around the S3 axis generated by J3 do not change the ﬁrst and the
last components of the Stokes four-vector (S0, S1, S2, S3). We can thus divide this four-
component vector into two two-component vectors:

SA =

S0
S3 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

SB =

S1
S2 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

The eﬀect of the decoherence matrix on SA will be

This is a squeeze transformation not aﬀected by rotations around the S3 axis. If we take
into account the overall factor mentioned after Eq.(7.5), the eﬀect of decoherence on SA is

(cid:19) (cid:18)

(cid:19) (cid:18)

The story is quite diﬀerent for SB. Here we are dealing with rotations and squeeze
transformations in the two-dimensional space of S1 and S2. In order to take advantage of
the mathematics of squeezed states [7], let us write Q3, W3, J3 as

B1 =

Q3, B2 =

W3, L3 =

J3.

(7.15)

These matrices form the closed set of commutation relations

[B1, B2] = −iL3,

[B2, L3] = iB3,

[L3, B1] = iB2,

(7.16)

which are very familiar to us from the squeezed state of light. They generate the group
Sp(2) or SU(1, 1). This is by now a standard mathematical tool in optics. The algebraic
property of this group is the same as the group of Lorentz transformations in two space-
like dimensions and one time-like dimension. This group is routinely called O(2, 1) in the
literature, and the generators satisfy the same set of commutation relations as the above set
for Sp(2) [7].

15

Thus the matrix algebra applicable to the two-component vector SB is the same as
that for the Sp(2) squeezed states and/or the (2 + 1)-dimensional Lorentz group. The
decoherence along the S1 direction is

eλ
0

(cid:18)

0
e−λ

.

(cid:19)

The decoherence transformation along the direction which makes an angle θ with the S1
axis is

cosh ρ + (sinh ρ) cos(2θ)
(sinh ρ) sin(2θ)

(cid:18)

(sinh ρ) sin(2θ)
cosh ρ − (sinh ρ) cos(2θ) (cid:19)

.

Thus the decoherence along the S1 direction followed by the above transformation is

cosh ρ + (sinh ρ) cos(2θ)
(sinh ρ) sin(2θ)

(cid:18)

(sinh ρ) sin(2θ)

cosh ρ − (sinh ρ) cos(2θ) (cid:19) (cid:18)

eλ

0
e−λ

.

(cid:19)

The computation of this matrix algebra leads to another decoherence matrix preceded by a
rotation matrix

cosh ξ + (sinh ξ) cos(2α)
(sinh ξ) sin(2α)

(sinh ξ) sin(2α)

cosh ξ − (sinh ξ) cos(2α) (cid:19) (cid:18)

where

(7.17)

(7.18)

(7.19)

cosh ξ = (cosh λ) cosh ρ + (sinh λ)(sinh ρ) cos θ,

tan α =

(sin θ)[sinh ρ + (tanh λ)(cosh ρ − 1) cos θ]
(sinh ρ) cos θ + (tanh λ)[1 + (cosh ρ − 1)(cos θ)2 ,

tan φ =

(tanh ρ)(tan λ) sin 2θ
1 + (tanh λ)(tan ρ) cos 2θ

.

(7.21)

The calculation leading to the above expression is well known from the squeezed state and
the Lorentz transformation. The overall decoherence factors for Eq.(7.17) and Eq.(7.18) are
e−λ and e−ρ respectively. The overall factor for Eq.(7.20) is e−ξ, and the net decoherence
eﬀect on SB is

cosh ξ + (sinh ξ) cos(2α)
(sinh ξ) sin(2α)

e−ξ

(cid:18)

(sinh ξ) sin(2α)

cosh ξ − (sinh ξ) cos(2α) (cid:19) (cid:18)

cos φ − sin φ
sin φ

cos φ (cid:19)

.

(7.22)

The non-trivial aspect of this calculation is the rotation matrix in the above expression. The
decoherence followed by another decoherence does not always result in a decoherence. It is
a decoherence preceded by a rotation. It is a simple matter to detect this rotation once the
decoherence ﬁlters are built in laboratories.

This eﬀect of the Lorentz group has been discussed in connection with polarization op-
tics [9,10]. In special relativity, this extra rotation is called the Thomas eﬀect and manifests
itself in the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom [19].

VIII. FURTHER PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS

We have thus far reformulated the existing mathematical devices for polarization optics
In so
in terms of the two-by-two and four-by-four representations of the Lorentz group.
doing, we have achieved a uniﬁed group theoretical formulation of polarization optics. The
next question then is whether this new formulation will lead to new applications or new
experiments. This question is not unlike the question arising from Maxwell’s formulation
of electromagnetism. After putting together various aspects of electricity and magnetism
into a single mathematical formalism, we are led to the question of whether the formalism
leads to a new physics. In the case of Maxwell’s equations, the new physics led to wireless
communication and electronic industry.

The result of this paper is not as far-reaching as in Maxwell’s case, but we are working
within the same philosophical framework as the case of Maxwell’s equations. Yes, we have
uniﬁed various aspects of polarization optics into a single group theoretical formalism We
are now interested in new conclusions which can be derived and which can be observed in
laboratories. For this purpose, we note that the Lorentz group has interesting subgroups.
The Lorentz group has six generators forming a closed set of commutation relations. We
have already used this concept when we discussed a system consisting only of phase shifters,
which is governed by O(3) or the three-dimensional rotation group with three generators.
The group O(3) is a subgroup of the Lorentz group.
It was noted that the system of
attenuators is governed by the O(2, 1) subgroups of the Lorentz group again with three
generators.

We have achieved the full six-parameter Lorentz group by combining both the phase-
shifters and attenuators. We are then led to the question of whether this full Lorentz group
has subgroups other than the input groups O(3) and O(2, 1). As we discuss in Appendix A,
there is an interesting subgroup which is like the two-dimensional Euclidean group. This is
the product of our group theoretical formulation. In this section, we outline ﬁrst the result
of our eﬀort on the Jones-matrix formalism [5]. We shall then extend this result to the case
of Stokes parameters.

The Lorentz group has three boost and three rotation generators. As we shall note in

Appendix A, we can construct a set of generators consisting of J3, N1 and N2, with

N1 = J1 + K2,

N2 = J2 − K1.

These generators satisfy the commutation relations:

[J3, N1] = iN2,

[J3, N2] = −iN1,

[N1, N2] = 0.

In the case of two-by-two Jones-matrix formalism, they take the form

N1 =

0 1
0 0 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

N2 =

0 −i
0

0 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(8.1)

(8.2)

(8.3)

They indeed form a closed set of commutation relations. As shown in Appendix B, these
commutation relations are like those for the two-dimensional Euclidean group consisting of
two translations and one rotation around the origin. This group has been studied extensively
in connection with the space-time symmetries of massless particles, where J1 and the two
N generators correspond to the helicity and gauge degrees of freedom respectively [20].

17

However, this group is relatively new in optics [5,21], and we are tempted to construct an
optical ﬁlter possessing this symmetry. The physics of J3 is well known through the phase
shifter given in Eq.(3.4). If the angle δ is π/2, the phase shifter becomes a quarter-wave
shifter, which we write as

Then J1 and K2 are the quarter-wave conjugates of J2 and K1 respectively:

Q = P (0, π/2) =

e−iπ/4
0

(cid:18)

0
eiπ/4

.

(cid:19)

J1 = QJ2Q−1,

K2 = −QK1Q−1.

Consequently,

N1 = QN2Q−1.

The N generators lead to the following transformation matrices.

T1(u) = exp (−iuN1) =

T2(v) = exp (−ivN2) =

1 iu

(cid:18)

=

Ex − vEy
Ey

.

(cid:19)

It is clear that T1 is the quarter-wave conjugate of T2. We can now concentrate on the
transformation matrix T2.

If T2 is applied to the incoming wave of Eq.(2.1),

This new ﬁlter superposes the y component of the electric ﬁeld to the x component with an
appropriate constant, but it leaves the y component invariant.

Let us examine how this is achieved. The generator N2 consists of J2 which generates
rotations around the z axis, and K1 which generates a squeeze along the 45o axis. Physically,
J2 generates optical activities. Thus, the new ﬁlter consists of a suitable combination of these
two operations. In both cases, we have to take into account the overall attenuation factor.
This can be measured by the attenuation of the y component which is not aﬀected by the
symmetry operation of Eq.(8.8).

Is it possible to produce optical ﬁlters of this kind? Starting from an optically active
material, we can introduce an asymmetry in absorption to it by either mechanical or electrical
means. Another approach would be to pile up alternately the J3-type and K2-type layers.
In either case, it is interesting to note that the combination of these two eﬀects produces a
special eﬀect predicted from the Lorentz group.

The group E(2), although new in optics, has many interesting properties having to do
with our daily life. One important property is the conversion of multiplication into addition
as the following matrix algebra indicates:

(8.9)

Since this group deals with rotations and translations on a plane, it has a great potential in
navigational sciences. However, we are here interested in what role this group plays in the
Stokes parameters.

In the Jones-matrix formalism, we used two-by-two matrices for transformations. For the
Stokes parameters, we have to use four-by-four matrices applicable to Stokes four-vectors.
The four-by-four generators of the Lorentz transformations are given in Sec. IV. They are
discussed in more detail in Appendix A. There, the generators N1 and N2 are derived from
the boost and rotation generators. From these generators, we can construct transformation
matrices:

T1(u) = exp (−iuN1)

(8.10)

These expressions are the four-by-four representation of the transformation matrices given
in Eq.(8.7) for the Jones spinors.

Unlike the Jones-matrix formalism, the Stokes parameters can describe partially coherent
light waves. This is the reason why the above four-by-four expression is complicated. These
transformation matrices preserve coherence. If decoherence is introduced, we can apply the
decoherence matrices discussed in Sec. VII. It is interesting to note that the Lorentz-group
formulation of polarization optics opens up this kind of new possibilities in physics.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have shown that both the Jones-matrix formalism and the Stokes pa-
rameters can be formulated as two diﬀerent representations of the same Lorentz group. The
physics of the Stokes parameters can deal with the coherence between the two polarization
directions. It is shown also that the decoherence eﬀect can also be formulated within the
framework of the Lorentz group or in terms of the mathematics of squeezed states of light.
There have been in the past many laudable attempts to construct a mathematical rep-
resentation for polarization optics based on the Lorentz group [17,22,23]. However, the
Lorentz group, particularly its relevance to optics, was not fully appreciated until it started
playing the role of the underlying symmetry group for squeezed states of light [7,24–26].
This naturally led to a new interest in possible applications of the Lorentz group in other
branches of optics including polarization optics [9,10,23].

From the group theoretical point of view, what is new in this paper is that we used
in Sec. V an additional symmetry of the Lorentz group to understand fully the connection
between the Jones matrix and the Stokes parameters. This additional symmetry was the

19

one which connects electrons with positrons through charge conjugation. This opens a new
research line which will connect symmetries of relativistic particles with polarization optics.
We can attempt to understand the symmetries of particle physics not from commutation
relations of group generators but from what we observe in optics laboratories.

It is true that we used group theory as the main carrier of our analysis. On the other
hand, it is true also that we did not start our paper with commutation relations, but with
what we observe in the real world. We concluded this paper with what we can observe or
we may possibly observe in the real world.

APPENDIX A: SUBGROUPS OF THE LORENTZ GROUP

Let us consider the space-time coordinates (t, x, y, z), analogous to the Stokes parameters
(S0, S1, S2, S3). Then the rotation around the z axis is performed by the four-by-four matrix

This transformation is generated by J3 of Eq.(4.16). The generators of rotations around the
x and y axes are also given in Eq.(4.16) and Eq.(4.18). These three generators satisfy the
closed set of commutations relations

This set of commutation relations is for the three-dimensional rotation group.

which is generated by K3 of Eq.(4.20). Boosts along the x and y axes are generated by K1
and K2 given in Eq.(4.17) and Eq.(4.20) respectively. These boost generators satisfy the
commutation relations

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk,

[Ki, Kj] = −iǫijkJk.

(A4)

Indeed, the three rotation generators and the three boost generators satisfy the closed set
of commutation relations given in Eq.(A2) and Eq.(A4). The four-by-four transformation
matrices generated by these generators are directly applicable to the space-time four-vector
(t, x, y, z) and also to the Stokes four-vector (S0, S1, S2, S3).

We can now construct a subset of the generators consisting of J3, N1 and N2 deﬁned in

Eq.(8.1). J3 is given in Eq.(4.16). Thus the generators N1 and N2 take the form

These four-by-four matrices satisfy the closed set of commutation relations given in Eq.(8.2).
The subgroup of the Lorentz group generated by the above matrices governs the inter-
nal space-time symmetry of massless particles, and has been extensively discussed in the
literature [11,12,15]. These expressions are new in optics.

APPENDIX B: TWO-DIMENSIONAL EUCLIDEAN TRANSFORMATIONS

In Sec. VIII, we discussed a set of commutation relations satisﬁed by the generators of
the two-dimensional Euclidean group. The purpose of this Appendix is to construct the
generators for the group of transformations on a ﬂat plane. There are translations and
rotations.

Let us consider here a two-dimensional plane and use the xy coordinate system. Then

Lz deﬁned as

will generate rotations around the origin. The translation generators are

Lz = −i

x

− y

∂
∂y

(

∂
∂x )

Px = −i

Py = −i

∂
∂x

,

∂
∂y

.

These generators satisfy the commutation relations:

[Lz, Px] = iPy,

[Lz, Py] = −iPx

[Px, Py] = 0.

These commutation relations are like those given in Eq.(8.2). They become identical if Lz,
Px and Py are replaced by J1, N2 and N3 respectively.

This group is not discussed often in physics, but is intimately related to our daily life.
When we drive on the streets, we make translations and rotations, and thus make trans-
formations of this E(2) group.
In addition, this group reproduces the internal internal
space-time symmetry of massless particles [27]. This aspect of the E(2) group has been
extensively discussed in the literature [11,12,15,20].

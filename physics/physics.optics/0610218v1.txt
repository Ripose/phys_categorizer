ABSTRACT

We perform 3D lithography simulations by using a ﬁnite-element solver. To proof applicability to real 3D
problems we investigate DUV light propagation through a structure of size 9 µm × 4 µm × 65 nm. On this
relatively large computational domain we perform rigorous computations (No Hopkins) taking into account a grid
of 11 × 21 source points with two polarization directions each. We obtain well converged results with an accuracy
of the diﬀraction orders of about 1%. The results compare well to experimental aerial imaging results. We
further investigate the convergence of 3D solutions towards quasi-exact results obtained with diﬀerent methods.

Keywords: Photomask, microlithography, simulation, ﬁnite element method, FEM

1. INTRODUCTION

Shrinking feature sizes in optical lithography lead to increasing importance of rigorous simulations for process
design.1 Modern lithography simulators include modules describing illumination, transfer of the optical ﬁeld
through the mask and aberrating optical system of the lithographic equipment, the propagation inside the
photoresist, the processes leading to the resist image and – in advanced systems – the etching processes leading
to the etched image. After nearly two decades of lithography simulation, most of the modules along the simulation
chain have attained a high degree of maturity. However, the simulation of light propagation through lithography
masks is still challenging in terms of computational time and memory and accuracy of the results.

The computation of the print image of a whole chip remains extremely demanding although approximations,
multi-threading and even hardware accelerators are applied to reduce the runtime of simulations. Rigorous
simulations are restricted today to small areas and even those simulations suﬀer from the high computational
eﬀort. At the same time, the progress on the semiconductor roadmap forces the need of rigorous 3D simulations.

We consider light scattering oﬀ a mask which is periodic in the x− and y−directions and is enclosed by
homogeneous substrate (at zsub) and superstrate (at zsup) which are inﬁnite in the −, resp. +z−direction.
However, the presented FEM concept holds as well for non-periodic scattering objects, where the surround-
ing space is either homogeneous or consists of layered media or waveguide structures. Light propagation in
the investigated system is governed by Maxwell’s equations where vanishing densities of free charges and cur-
rents are assumed. The dielectric coeﬃcient ε(~x) and the permeability µ(~x) of the considered photomasks
are periodic and complex, ε (~x) = ε (~x + ~a), µ (~x) = µ (~x + ~a). Here ~a is any elementary vector of the pe-
riodic lattice. For given primitive lattice vectors ~a1 and ~a2 an elementary cell Ω ⊂ R3 is deﬁned as Ω =
~x ∈ R2 | x = α1~a1 + α2~a2; 0 ≤ α1, α2 < 1
× [zsub, zsup]. A time-harmonic ansatz with frequency ω and mag-
netic ﬁeld H(~x, t) = e−iωtH(~x) leads to the following equations for H(~x):

The DtN operator (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) is realized with the PML method.7 This is a generalized
formulation of Sommerfeld’s radiation condition; it can be realized alternatively by the Pole condition
method.8

H(~x) = ei~k·~xu(~x),

where the Bloch wavevector ~k ∈ R3 is deﬁned by the incoming plane wave H in.

Similar equations are found for the electric ﬁeld E(~x, t) = e−iωtE(~x); these are treated accordingly. The ﬁnite-
element method solves Eqs. (1) – (4) in their weak form, i.e., in an integral representation. The computational
domain is discretized with triangular (2D) or tetrahedral/prismatoidal (3D) patches. The use of prismatoidal
patches is well suited for layered geometries, as in photomask simulations. This also simpliﬁes the geometry
description of the mask layout. Sidewall angles diﬀerent from 90 deg are not regarded throughout this paper;
however, they can easily be implemented with reasonable restrictions. The function spaces are discretized
using Nedelec’s edge elements, which are vectorial functions of polynomial order (here, ﬁrst to fourth order)
deﬁned on the triangular or tetrahedral patches.10
In a nutshell, FEM can be explained as expanding the ﬁeld
corresponding to the exact solution of Equation (1) in the basis given by these elements. This leads to a large
sparse matrix equation (algebraic problem). For details on the weak formulation, the choice of Bloch-periodic
functional spaces, the FEM discretization, and our implementation of the PML method we refer to previous
works.5, 7, 11
In future implementations performance will further be increased by using higher order elements,
p > 4, hp-adaptive methods, and by using elements of diﬀerent polynomial order parallel and orthogonal to
the layers of the layered geometry (corresponding to the x − y−plane of Fig. 4 b). To solve the algebraic
problem on a standard workstation either standard linear algebra decomposition techniques (LU-factorization,
e.g., package PARDISO12) or iterative and domain decomposition methods13–15 are used, depending on problem
size. Domain decomposition methods as shown in Ref.14 for 2D FEM simulations can be easily transferred to
layered 3D geometries (typical photomask geometries) and other 3D geometries. Due to the use of multi-grid
algorithms, the computational time and the memory requirements grow linearly with the number of unknowns.

We investigate a 3D test structure as schematically depicted in Figure 1. The structure consists of MoSi-lines
of height h with a sidewall angle of 90 deg on a glass substrate. This pattern was chosen to have low vector and
interference eﬀects but still signiﬁcant 3D eﬀects, and because it appears in current lithography production. With

numerical solution N for ﬁnite elements of polynomial degree p = 1 . . . 4. Results of an estimated relative error around
1-2% are reached for N ≈ 5 · 105 and p = 4.

the project parameters as given in Table 1 the size of the computational domain is around 103 cubic wavelengths.
We discretize the computational domain using prismatoidal patches, and we use higher order, vectorial ansatz
functions as ﬁnite elements deﬁned on these patches.

Figure 3 shows the convergence of the simulated zero order far ﬁeld coeﬃcient. Plotted is the magnitude
of the far ﬁeld coeﬃcient vs. number of degrees of freedom of the ﬁnite element expansion. Data points are
attained using ﬁnite elements of ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth polynomial order and using meshes with diﬀerent
reﬁnement levels. With increasing ﬁnite element degree and with decreasing mesh size the results converge.
From these results we guess the relative error for a solution using fourth order ﬁnite elements and using about
5 × 105 unknowns is of the order of 1%.

To model illumination with a realistic source we construct a grid of 11 × 21 source points in wavevector-space.
For each source point we deﬁne two plane waves with orthogonal polarizations. This makes a total of 462 sources.
In order to obtain the scattering response of an extended, measured C-Quad source we linearly interpolate the
results for each measured source point between the closest simulated source points and superpose the results.

JCMharmony allows to calculate the scattering response of all of the 462 sources in a single programme run. The
total computation time on a workstation (2 64bit processors, around 20 GB RAM) to obtain the 462 near ﬁeld
solutions, each with 482,040 degrees of freedom, was around 100 minutes. We currently work on the signiﬁcant
reduction of the near ﬁeld computation time.

A simulation on this area is impossible with present Solid-E 3.3 or Prolith 9.1 even for a single illumination
direction due to memory consumption at necessary resolution. Also the simulation time with unacceptable coarse
grids is orders of magnitude higher.

We use the far ﬁeld coeﬃcients to generate an aerial image. Figure 2 a) shows a pseudo color representation
of the intensity distribution in the image plane (demagniﬁcation factor 4). The scalar intensity distribution has
been obtained from the vectorial electric ﬁeld distribution. Figure 2 b) shows a similar intensity distribution
obtained using a non-rigorous method (Kirchhoﬀ approximation). Obviously, the approximation compares well
with the rigorous solution for this speciﬁc simulation example. I.e., interference eﬀects, high-NA eﬀects or other
eﬀects do not play a role here. This example was rather chosen to demonstrate the applicability of a rigoros
method to large 3D problems.

Figure 2 c) shows an experimentally obtained aerial image obtained using AIMS. The minima in the experi-
mental aerial image of the mask structure are more pronounced than in the simulation. This can be, e.g., caused
by uncertainties in the geometry of the sample. As has been shown in diﬀerent works16 the high accuracy and
speed of rigorous FEM simulations can be utilized to obtain precise informations about the sample geometry or
material parameters by optimizing the deviation from experimentally obtained data.

3. VALIDATION OF THE RESULTS

In order to validate the results of the FEM solver we have performed several tests. Here we present 3D simulations
of line masks and compare the results to results using 2D simulations of the same physical settings. For these we
have we have investigated the convergence towards results obtained with various methods, as reported earlier.2

Figure 4 shows a schematics of the geometry of a periodic line mask. TM polarized light is incident from the
substrate and is diﬀracted into various diﬀraction orders. The geometry parameters are listed in Table 1 (data
set 2). Please see Reference2 for more details on this test case. The 2D simulation results given in the ﬁrst line
of Table 2 are the best converged results from this reference for the given test case. We therefore refer to these
results as ’quasi-exact’ results. Table 2 further shows results obtained with 3D FEM on the geometry as depicted
in Figure 4 b). Vectorial ﬁnite elements of order 1 to 4 on grids with diﬀerent mesh reﬁnements have been used
to obtain rigorous near ﬁeld solutions from which the zero order far ﬁeld coeﬃcients are obtained. As expected
and as can be seen from the results, most accurate results are obtained using elements of high order and ﬁne
meshes. Figure 5 shows the convergence of the results on several ﬁxed FEM grids with elements of increasing
polynomial order. As expected, with increasing polynomial order the numerical approximation error converges
exponentially towards zero.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed rigorous 3D FEM simulations of light transition through a large 3D photomask (size of the
computational domain about 1000 cubic wavelengths). We have achieved results at high numerical accuracy
which compare well to experimental ﬁndings using aerial imaging. We have checked the convergence for this 3D
case and we have checked the convergence of the method for a simpler case, where a quasi-exact result is available.
Our results show that rigorous 3D mask simulations can well be handled at high accuracy and relatively low
computational cost.

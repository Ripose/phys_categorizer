A Conjecture for Using Optical Methods for Aﬀecting
Superﬂuid Hydrodynamics

Abstract

The relation between the macroscopic quantum coherent nature of superﬂuids
and the coherent properties of optical interference patterns will be utilized to
examine the optical properties of superﬂuid hydrodynamics. A Bragg pattern
imposed on the superﬂuid (either holographically or using a phase mask) is
expected to induce periodic variations in the local index of refraction of the
normal and super ﬂuid components. The altered optical properties can then be
probed by a second coherent light source. In this manner, the behavior of the
probe beam can be switched using the speciﬁc characteristics of the imposed
pattern. Acoustic modes should also manifest measurable aﬀects on incident
coherent radiations.

1 Introduction

There is considerable interest in developing optical phase masks with dif-
factive orders that can be tuned for varying applications without a need for
material modiﬁcations or reconstruction. Such devices would not only be useful
for writing Bragg patterns in optical ﬁbers for communication purposes, but if
the pattern is optically induced, would provided a mechanism for the optical
switching of propagated modes. The development of such a device is explored
in what follows. A more detailed description can be found in the literature2.

The imposed pattern induces spatial dependence of the dielectric constant

where δǫ is dependent upon the ﬁeld intensity of the pattern through induced
temperature and density perturbations. The optical response of this pattern
is then probed by directing a second coherent beam into this region, causing
the probe beam to decompose into diﬀraction orders as illustrated in Figure 1:
As shown elsewhere, this response is eﬀectively that of a tunable phase mask3,

with the probe beam optically switched by the holographic pattern. The eﬀect
should manifest for any non-linear optical material or macroscopic quantum
system, such as a superﬂuid or superconductor.
In particular, the aﬀects of
such induced patterns on an optically thin superﬂuid will be examined in what
follows.

The time derivatives of the log of the dielectric constant are assumed small
compared to the frequency of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. The polarization Ex of
the probe ﬁeld is chosen perpendicular to the induced variations in the dielectric

The probe ﬁeld then reﬂects this periodic behavior

The unconstrained coeﬃcients are chosen to satisfy the incoming and outgoing
boundary conditions at the interphases.

To get a feel for the scale of the mode mixing in the probe beam, consider
a pattern with spacing = 6µm imposed on a material with refractive index
1.75 inducing relative index variations of 0.5%. If a probe beam of wavelength
0.632µm is incident at the +1st order angle 6.04637◦, the resulting orders can be
numerically solved as a function of sample thickness. The amplitudes (assuming
minimal beam absorption) are demonstrated in Figure 2. For pattern depths
greater than about 50 µm there is signiﬁcant mode mixing.

3 Optical Properties of Quantum Fluids

Many of the hydrodynamic properties of liquid 4He can be understood in
terms of a quantum two ﬂuid model. The normal ﬂuid has viscous ﬂow and
carries any entropy ﬂux through the ﬂuid, while below Tλ ∼= 2.17◦K there
is a superﬂuid component that behaves like a macroscopic quantum system
exhibiting persistent non-viscous ﬂow and quantization of circulation4. Helium

3.2 Standing waves in a bulk quantum ﬂuid

The strategy of the present approach is to utilize the coherent nature of
radiation from a laser to aﬀect the coherent behavior of a macroscopic quan-
tum system. Figure 3 represents an arrangement of a macroscopic loop which
establishes a set of discrete valued properties within the quantum ﬂuid. The

region being probed could be excited by mechanical, thermal, or optical per-
turbations7. Generally, the superﬂuid component is locally accelerated from
regions of high chemical potential towards regions of lower chemical potential.
Assume that the speeds vs, vn, the density and entropy perturbations δρ, δσ,
and the pressure and temperature gradients are all ﬁrst order small variations
from equilibrium values. Stationary temperature variations will be imposed on
the quantum ﬂuid in the form of the real part of

The scale of the variations are seen to be signiﬁcant for low frequencies and a

(3.13)

Since there is considerable variability with temperature of the normal ﬂuid den-
sity (which decreases to zero at absolute zero) and the coeﬃcient of volumetric
expansion, one expects to be able to arrange conditions such that there are
measurable eﬀects upon the optical properties a superﬂuid due to an imposed
time varying pattern.

Coherent light should also modify the material properties of the quantum
ﬂuid, changing its mechanical and thermal states.
In particular, we expect
quantized resonant responses of superﬂuid systems to coherent perturbative in-
ﬂuences when conﬁgured as in Figure 3. Since as previously mentioned the
speed of second sound is of order u2 ∼ 20 m/s, there would be micron scale
temperature variations for frequencies of the order 200KHz, with lower frequen-
cies requiring patterns of wider spacing. There should be resonant thermal wave
eﬀects for such patterns. Standing acoustic waves of micron scale wavelengths
should immediately have measurable eﬀects on the probe beam, assuming the
wave pattern can be appropriately stabilized.

4 Conclusion

The two ﬂuid model suggests that an optical interference pattern placed on a
superﬂuid should induce local variations in the ﬂuid’s hydrodynamic parameters.
A second coherent light source can be used to probe those variations through
diﬀractive eﬀects. Calculations have been presented that suggest the scale of
hydrodynamic variations that can be induced, and the potential measurement
of those variations. Any measured diﬀractive eﬀect on a probe beam due to the
presence of an imposed pattern would demonstrate an optical switching of that

of appropriate scale in the superﬂuid should have a measurable impact on the
properties of the probe beam.

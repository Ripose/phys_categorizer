We derive envelope equations which generate the Maxwell-Lorentz model and

describe the interaction of optical pulses with plasmonic oscillations in metal

nanoparticle composites. A family of solitary wave solutions is found which

is analogous to self-induced transparency in Maxwell-Bloch. The evolution of

incident optical pulses is studied numerically as are the collision dynamics of

the solitary waves. These simulations reveal that the collision dynamics vary

from near perfectly elastic to highly radiative depending on the relative phase

of the initial pulses.

Quantum eﬀects in metal nanoparticles driven by a resonant optical ﬁeld play an impor-

tant role in inducing a strong nonlinear response, as was recently shown.1, 2 In this Letter we

consider the nonlinear resonant interaction of ultrashort optical pulses with metal nanopar-

ticles distributed uniformly in a host medium. We restrict to the case of composite materials

for which the resonance frequencies of the host medium are well separated from those of the

nanoparticles. Examples include silver or gold spherical or spheroidal nanoparticles embed-

ded in SiO2. In these cases, the plasmonic resonance frequencies are in the visible part of the

spectrum while the resonance of the host is in the ultraviolet.

Light interaction with metal nanoparticles can be described by a system consisting of

Maxwell’s equations for the electric ﬁeld, and an oscillator equation describing the displace-

ment of conduction electrons in the metal nanoparticles from equilibrium (plasmonic oscil-

lations). The nanoparticles are much smaller than the optical carrier wavelength λ0. This

allows light scattering and spatial eﬀects in the nanoparticles to be neglected. As shown by

2

Rautian1 and Drachev, et al.,2 who further developed the earlier work by Hache, et al.,3

the response of the conduction electrons in the metal nanoparticles to an external electric

ﬁeld induces a leading-order cubic nonlinearity. The interaction of the electric ﬁeld with

plasmonic oscillations in nanoparticles with resonance frequency ωr in the presence of this

cubic nonlinearity can be described by the forced Duﬃng equation

We are interested in pulse dynamics which vary on a much slower scale than the plasmonic,

in the direction of the electric ﬁeld polarization, and ∆a = ωa −
resonance frequency of host atoms. The last two terms in Eq. (3) represent corrections to the

ω0 is detuning from the

refractive index and group index due to the oﬀ-resonance interaction with the host medium,

which, for illustration, is considered as an ensemble of two-level atoms. This equation is

derived from the Maxwell-Bloch equations in the non-resonant case by considering ∆a as a

large parameter and applying the adiabatic following approximation.4 Additional resonances

would produce similar terms. We consider the case where optical pulse intensity and duration

as well as composite material parameters are such that the characteristic length of resonant

light interaction with plasmonic oscillations is much smaller than the characteristic lengths

for both group velocity dispersion and nonlinearity induced by the host medium. Therefore

the terms representing these eﬀects are omitted from Eq. (3).

In a composite material, the sizes and shapes of metal nanoparticles vary due to limited

fabrication tolerances. It is known that the plasmon resonance in spherical metal nanopar-

ticles depends weakly on size in the range between 10 and 50nm,5 so that variations in size

are not important. However, variations in the shape and orientation of the nanoparticles

can signiﬁcantly change plasmonic resonance frequencies. This results in a broadening of the

These equations represent a generalization of the classical Maxwell-Lorentz model. In the

case of identical nanoparticles, the averaging in (5) can be reduced to a single dimensionless

In optics it has become standard practice to refer to certain solutions of nonintegrable

systems as solitons. These solutions are characterized as solitary waves which are robust to

external perturbations including collisions with other solitary waves. In addition, arbitrary

initial data for these “soliton” supporting systems tends to evolve into a sum of solitary waves

and continuous radiation. The remainder of this Letter details our numerical investigation of

these properties, in which Eqs. (5) are integrated in the case of delta-distributed resonance

frequencies and zero detuning.

Numerical simulations of the evolution of Gaussian initial data are presented in Figs. 1a

and b. In Fig. 1a the initial condition E(t, 0) = exp(

t2/2)/2 simply evolves into continuous

radiation, while in Fig. 1b the initial condition E(t, 0) = 2 exp(

t2/2) emits some radiation

−

−

but also achieves energy conﬁnement and persists as a soliton. This behavior is similar to the

self-induced transparency exhibited by the Maxwell-Bloch equations6 which describe optical

pulse interaction with resonant two-level media. As the amplitude of the initial pulse is

increased, the pulse splits into two [illustrated in Fig 2a for the initial condition E(t, 0) =

6

6
5 exp(

t2/2)] or more solitons and emits continuous radiation. The inset shows a comparison

−

between the numerics and the analytic form of the solitary waves of Eq. (6). The velocity

and frequency of the solitary waves are obtained from measurements of their amplitudes

and half widths in our simulation. The agreement of the analytic forms with the simulation

results indicates that the system self-selects the solitary waves presented in Eq. (6). Fig. 2b

shows the amplitude(s) of these solitons as a function of input pulse amplitude. As the input

pulse amplitude increases, the output soliton amplitude also increases until a bifurcation

occurs and a new soliton emerges. Increasing the input pulse amplitude further results in

the production of more solitons, along with continuous radiation.

Two simulations illustrating collision dynamics are presented in Figs. 3a and 3b, where the

sum of two well-separated solitary waves is used as the initial condition. Fig. 3a illustrates

an in-phase collision, in which the relative phase ∆ϕ = ϕ1 −
identify the soliton. The other initial soliton parameters are v1 = 1, Ω1 = 0, τ1 =

ϕ2 = 0, where the subscripts

10,

−

v2 = 2, Ω2 = 0, and τ2 = 0. In Fig. 3b an out-of-phase ∆ϕ = π collision is illustrated. The

same parameters are used except for a shift in the relative phase. This results in a much

faster collision. In both simulations the solitary waves persist after the interaction, although

their characteristic parameters undergo shifts and radiation is emitted during the collision.

A numerical study indicates that the collisions are quasielastic for values in the approximate

interval ∆ϕ

(π, 2π). For some ∆ϕ values away from this interval, simulations show that

∈

one of the solitons is completely destroyed while the other persists. A detailed analysis of

the dependence on initial parameters will be presented elsewhere.

The soliton phenomena described above occurs at light intensities such that the dimen-

sionless ﬁeld amplitude E is at least of order one. The intensity at which E is order one

c(~ω0/ea)2. For the particle radius a = 20nm and the

≃

≃

carrier wavelength λ0 = 500nm, this results in light intensity of I

10GW/cm2 which can be

∼

easily obtained with ultrashort laser pulses. The optical pulse durations for which this model

is valid are limited by the condition ∆ω

ω0, (the spectral width of the pulse must be much

≪

smaller than the carrier frequency) required by the slowly varying envelope approximation.

The pulse duration should also be much shorter than the characteristic plasmonic oscillation

damping time, which is determined by the time required for electron thermalization in the

metal nanoparticles (

400fs7, 8). The envelope approximation is appropriate for pulses with

∼

width τ & 20fs.

In summary, a family of solitary wave solutions is derived in the envelope approximation for

the Maxwell wave and Duﬃng oscillator equations, showing that energy conﬁnement is pos-

sible for resonant optical pulse interaction with plasmonic oscillations in metal nanoparticles.

The existence condition for these solutions is presented. Numerical simulations show that

stable solitary waves evolve from arbitrarily-shaped initial pulses with suﬃcient amplitudes

and exhibit behavior analogous to self-induced transparency in Maxwell-Bloch. Simulations

also reveal that the collision dynamics are highly dependent on initial soliton parameters,

behaving quasielastically in some regimes but having radically diﬀerent behavior in others.

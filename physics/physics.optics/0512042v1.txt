Experimental evidence of bouncing localized structures in a nonlinear optical system is reported.
Oscillations in the position of the localized states are described by a consistent amplitude equation,
which we call the Lifshitz normal form equation, in analogy with phase transitions. Localized
structures are shown to arise close to the Lifshtiz point, where non-variational terms drive the
dynamics into complex and oscillatory behaviors.

Pacs: 05.45.-a, 42.65.Sf, 47.54.+r
During the last years localized structures have been
observed in diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as domains in magnetic
materials [1], chiral bubbles in liquid crystals [2], cur-
rent ﬁlaments in gas discharge experiments [3], spots in
chemical reactions [4], pulses [5], kinks [6] and localized
2D states [7] in ﬂuid surface waves, oscillons in granular
media [8], isolated states in thermal convection [9, 10],
solitary waves in nonlinear optics [11, 12, 13] and cavity
solitons in lasers [14]. Localized states are patterns which
extend only over a small portion of a spatially extended
and homogeneous system [15]. Diﬀerent mechanisms
leading to stable localization have been proposed [16].
Among these, two main classes of localized structures
have to be distinguished, namely those localized struc-
tures arising as solutions of a quintic Swift-Hohenberg
like equation [16] and those that are stabilized by nonva-
riational terms in the subcritical Ginzburg-Landau equa-
tion [17]. The main diﬀerence between the two cases
is that the ﬁrst-type localized structures have a char-
acteristic size which is ﬁxed by the pinning mechanism
over the underlying pattern or by spatial damped oscil-
lations between homogenous states[16, 18], whereas the
second-type ones have no intrinsic spatial length, their
size being selected by non-variational eﬀects and going
to inﬁnity when dissipation goes to zero. In both cases,
non-variational eﬀects may lead to dynamical behaviors
of localized structures[19]. Variational models based on
a generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation have been pro-
posed to describe the appearance of localized structures
in nonlinear optics [20]. However, a generalization in-
cluding non-variational terms is generically expected to
apply even in optics, as happens, for instance, in semi-
conductor laser instabilities [21], giving rise to dynamical
behaviors of localized structures, such as propagation and
oscillations of their positions [22].

We report here an experimental evidence of local-
ized structures dynamics in a Liquid-Crystal-Light-Valve
(LCLV) with optical feedback. It is already known that,
in the simultaneous presence of bistability and pattern
forming diﬀractive feedback, the LCLV system shows lo-
calized structures [12, 23, 24, 25]. Recently, rotation of
localized structures along concentric rings have been re-

ported in the case of a rotation angle introduced in the
feedback loop [26]. Here, we ﬁx a zero rotation angle
and we show a new dynamical behavior, the bouncing
of two adjacent localized structures, that is not related
to imposed boundary conditions but is instead a direct
consequence of the non-variational character of the sys-
tem under study. Theoretically, we show that the LCLV
system has several branches of bistability connecting an
homogeneous state to a patterned one and we derive an
amplitude equation accounting for the appearance of lo-
calized structures. This is a one-dimensional model, that
we call the Lifshitz normal form equation [22], character-
izing the dynamics of localized structures close to each
point of nascent bistability.

FIG. 1: Experimental setup: ~n liquid crystal nematic director;
Pin and Pf b input and feedback polarizers; L1 and L2 confocal
25 cm focal length lenses. −L is the free propagation length,
negative with respect to the plane on which a 1:1 image of
the front side of the LCLV is formed.

Description of the experiment. The experimental setup
is shown in Fig.1. The LCLV is composed of a nematic
liquid crystal ﬁlm sandwiched in between a glass and a
photoconductive plate over which a dielectric mirror is
deposed. The liquid crystal ﬁlm is planar aligned (ne-
matic director ~n parallel to the walls), with a thickness
d = 15 µm. The liquid crystal ﬁlling our LCLV is the
nematic LC-654, produced by NIOPIK (Moscow) [27]. It
is a mixture of cyano-biphenyls, with a positive dielectric
anisotropy ∆ε = εk − ε⊥ = +10.7 and large optical bire-
fringence, ∆n = nk − n⊥ = 0.2, where εk and ε⊥ are the

dielectric permittivities k and ⊥ to ~n, respectively, and
nk and are n⊥ are the extraordinary (k to ~n) and ordi-
nary (⊥ to ~n) refractive index, respectively. Transparent
electrodes over the glass plates permit the application of
an electrical voltage across the liquid crystal layer. The
photoconductor behaves like a variable resistance, which
decreases for increasing illumination. The feedback is ob-
tained by sending back onto the photoconductor the light
which has passed through the liquid-crystal layer and has
been reﬂected by the dielectric mirror. This light beam
experiences a phase shift which depends on the liquid
crystal reorientation and, on its turn, modulates the ef-
fective voltage that locally applies to the liquid crystals.
The feedback loop is closed by an optical ﬁber bundle
and is designed in such a way that diﬀraction and polar-
ization interference are simultaneously present [12]. The
optical free propagation length is ﬁxed to L = −10 cm.
At the linear stage for the pattern formation, a negative
propagation distance selects the ﬁrst unstable branch of
the marginal stability curve, as for a focusing medium.
The angles of the polarizers are at 45o with respect to the
liquid crystal director ~n. The free end of the ﬁber bundle
is mounted on a precision rotation and translation stage,
to avoid rotation or translation in the feedback loop.

FIG. 2: Spatially averaged feedback intensity < Iw > (units
are the gray values, g.v., on the CCD camera) as a function
of V0; input intensity Iin = 0.75 mW/cm2.

For this parameter setting, as V0 increases there is a
series of successive branches of bistability between a pe-
riodic pattern and a homogeneous solution. In Fig.2 we
report the spatially averaged feedback intensity < Iw >
measured for a ﬁxed value of the input intensity, Iin =
0.75 mW/cm2, and for varying V0, by integrating the
images on the near-ﬁeld CCD camera (see Fig.1) . The
abrupt changes of < Iw > correspond to the appearance
of localized structures and thus roughly indicate the loca-
tions of the nascent bistability points. The peak value in-
tensity of the localized structures is approximately twice
In the LCLV system, the
the average value < Iw >.
bistability between homogenous states results from the
subcritical character of the Fr´eedericksz transition, when
the local electric ﬁeld, which applies to the liquid crystals,
depends on the liquid crystal reorientation angle [28, 29].
Here, we limit our study to the bistable branch located
around V0 = 13.2 Vrms (frequency 5 KHz), however sim-
ilar observations can be obtained close to any other of the

2

nascent bistability points.

We have carried out one-dimensional experiments, in
order to avoid the inﬂuence of any optical misalignment
(such as small drifts) on the dynamics of localized states.
A rectangular mask is introduced in the optical feedback
loop, just in contact to the entrance side of the ﬁber bun-
dle. The width of the aperture is D = 0.50 mm whereas
its length is l = 20 mm. The size of each localized struc-
tures is Λ ≃ 350 µm, so that the transverse aspect ratio
D/Λ ≃ 1 is small enough for the system to be consid-
ered as one-dimensional and the longitudinal aspect ratio
l/Λ ≃ 60 is large enough for the system to be considered
as a spatially extended one.

Instantaneous snapshots of bouncing localized struc-
tures, together with their spatial proﬁles, are shown in
Fig.3, for V0 = 13.2 Vrms and Iin = 0.95 mW/cm2.
The corresponding spatio-temporal plot is displayed in
Fig.5b, showing the periodic oscillations for the positions
of the structures. In the same ﬁgure, Fig.5a, it is shown
the spatio-temporal plot corresponding to stationary lo-
calized structures, as observed for a slightly decreased
input intensity, Iin = 0.90 mW/cm2, and for the same
value of V0. Fig.5c displays the spatio-temporal diagram
corresponding to aperiodic oscillations in the structure
positions, as observed for V0 = 13.3 Vrms and Iin = 0.90
mW/cm2. The dynamical behavior of localized struc-
tures is very sensitive to parameter changes and, even
though their appearance is clearly located around each
point of nascent bistability, their stability range is smaller
than the width of the bistable region. When loosing sta-
bility, localized structures either form clusters or anni-
hilate, depending if they are driven on the pinning or
depinning side of the bistable region [18]. However, a

careful experimental characterization of the pinning front
is a work still in progress.

intensity Iw
reaching the photoconductor is given by [12], Iw =
2 |e−i L
θ)|2, where x is the transverse
Iin
direction of the liquid crystal layer, βcos2θ is the overall
phase shift experienced by the light travelling forth and
back through the liquid crystal layer; β = 2kd∆n, where
k = 2π/λ is the optical wave number (λ = 633 nm).

As long as Iin is suﬃciently small, that is, of the or-
der of a few mW/cm2, the eﬀective electric ﬁeld, Eef f ,
applied to the liquid crystal layer can be expressed as
Eef f = ΓV0/d + αIw, where V0 is the voltage applied to
the LCLV, 0 < Γ < 1 is a transfer factor that depends
on the electrical impedances of the photoconductor, di-
electric mirror and liquid crystals and α is a phenomeno-
logical dimensional parameter that describes the linear
response of the photoconductor [29].

Let us call θ (x, t) the average director tilt. θ = 0
is the initial planar alignment whereas θ = π/2 is the
homeotropic alignment corresponding to saturation of
the molecular reorientation. The dynamics of θ is de-
scribed by a local relaxation equation of the form

with Vef f = Eef f d = ΓV0 + αdIw(θ, ∂x) > VF T the ef-
fective voltage applied to the liquid crystals, VF T the
threshold for the Fr´eedericksz transition and l the elec-
tric coherence length. The above model have been de-
duced by ﬁtting the experimental data for the open loop
response of the LCLV [29] and it is slightly diﬀerent with
respect to the one proposed in Ref. [12]. It is important
to note that a rigorous derivation of the response func-
tion of the LCLV would require a modal expansion along
the longitudinal direction of the liquid crystal layer.

The homogeneous equilibrium solutions are θ0 = 0

The value of VF T is set to 3.2 Vrms, as measured for
the LCLV [28, 29], and the graph of θ0(V0, Iin) is plot-
ted in Fig.6. In agreement with the bistability branches
observed experimentally, several points of nascent bista-
bility can be distinguished, corresponding to the critical
points where θ0(V0, Iin) becomes a multi-valued function.

FIG. 6: The multi-valued function θ0(V0, Iin). Shaded areas
show the location of the nascent bistability points.

Close to each point of nascent bistability, and neglect-
ing spatial derivatives, we can develop θ = θ0 +u+... and
derive a normal form equation describing an imperfect
pitchfork bifurcation [15], ∂tu = η+µu−u3 +h.o.t, where
µ is the bifurcation parameter and η accounts for the
asymmetry between the two homogeneous states. Higher
order terms are ruled out by the scaling analysis, since
u ∼ µ1/2, η ∼ µ3/2 and ∂t ∼ µ, µ ≪ 1. If we now con-
sider the spatial eﬀects, due to the elasticity of the liquid
crystal and to the light diﬀraction, the system exhibits a
spatial instability as a function of the diﬀraction length
and, since the spatial dependence of Iw is nonlocal, the
dynamics is a non-variational one.

The conﬂuence of bistability and spatial bifurcation
give rise to a critical point of codimension three, that we
call the Lifshitz point, in analogy with the triple point in-
troduced for phase transitions in helicoidal ferromagnetic
states [30]. Close to this point, we derive an amplitude
equation, that we call the Lifshitz normal form [22],

∂tu = η + µu − u3 + ν ∂xxu − ∂xxxxu
+d u ∂xxu + c (∂xu)2,

(2)

where ∂x ∼ µ1/4, ν ∼ µ1/2 accounts for the intrinsic
length of the system (diﬀusion), d ∼ O (1) and c ∼ O (1).
The term ∂xxxxu describes a super-diﬀusion, accounting
for the short distance repulsive interaction, whereas the
terms proportional to d and c are, respectively, the non-
linear diﬀusion and convection. The full and lengthy ex-
pressions of these coeﬃcients, as a function of the LCLV
parameters, will be reported elsewhere [31]. Note that

the same model has been recently deduced for instabili-
ties in a semiconductor laser [21].

The model shows bistability between a homogeneous
and a spatially periodic solutions and therefore exhibits
a family of localized structures. Depending on the choice
of parameters, localized structures may show periodic or
aperiodic oscillations of their position. We can ﬁx µ and
η by varying V0 and Iin. More interesting is the be-
havior of the eﬀective diﬀusion term ν, which has the
form ν ∝ l2 + (πβL cos2(β/2 cos2 θo) sin 2θ0)/4k((ΓVo +
αIin(1+cos(β cos2 θ0))). Only when the optical free prop-
agation length L is negative it is possible, by increasing
the input intensity Iin, to drive the system through the
Lifshitz point (ν changes its sign from positive to neg-
ative). This means that stable localized structures can
be obtained only for a focusing Kerr-like nonlinearity.
Once crossed the Lifshitz point, the nonlinear diﬀusion
coeﬃcient is negative and the convection coeﬃcient is
positive. In this region of parameters, numerical simu-
lations of Eq.(2) show a qualitative agreement with the
experimental observations, as shown in Fig.7.

Conclusions. We have shown a new kind of localized
structure dynamics, consisting of a bouncing behavior
between two adjacent structures, and we have described
it by an universal model, the Lifshitz normal form equa-
tion. The Lifshitz equation, that reduces to the gen-
eralized Swift-Hohenberg equation for η = d = c = 0,
has already been used to describe the transition from
smectic to helicoidal phase in liquid crystals [32] and the
pulse dynamics in reaction diﬀusion systems [33]. When
one neglects the cubic and the nonlinear diﬀusion terms
(d = 0), it reduces to the Nikolaevskii equation that de-
scribes longitudinal seismic waves [34].

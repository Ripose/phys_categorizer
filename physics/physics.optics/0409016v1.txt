INTRODUCTION

Spatio-temporal broadening of localized wavepackets
with ﬁnite energy due to the eﬀects of diﬀraction and
dispersion is a universal and challenging phenomenon in
any physical context involving wave propagation. If the
ﬁnite energy constraint is left, special spatio-temporal
waves with a certain degree of localization in space
and/or in time, capable of propagating free of diﬀrac-
tion and/or temporal dispersion, can be constructed. Lo-
calized waves of this type include, among others, Bessel
beams, focus-wave modes, X-type waves, pulsed Bessel
beams [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Though these waves can be only
approximately realized in practice, several experiments in
acoustic and optical ﬁelds have been reported so far show-
ing nearly-undistorted localized wave propagation. As
the existence of undistorted progressive localized waves
in vacuum has been known since many years and lead
to long-standing studies [1, 2], with special attention de-
voted toward their superluminal or subluminal character
and to their ﬁnite-energy realizations, in the past few
years these studies have been extended to dispersive op-
tical media [3, 4, 5], and remarkably the spontaneous gen-
eration of localized and nonspreading wavepackets medi-
ated by optical nonlinearities has been predicted [6] and
experimentally observed [7] using standard femtosecond
pulsed lasers. Very recently, in a few works [8, 9, 10]
the issue of spatial or spatio-temporal wave localization
in periodic media has been addressed, and the possibility
of exploiting well-established anomalous diﬀractive and
dispersive properties of photonic crystals (PCs) [11, 12]
to induce novel spatio-temporal wave localization mecha-
nisms has been proposed. Speciﬁcally, these studies have
been concerned with localization of Bose-Einstein con-
densates in a one-dimensional optical lattice without any
trapping potential [8], with two-dimensional (2D) spa-
tial Bessel X waves in weakly-coupled 2D waveguide ar-
rays showing bi-dispersive properties [9] and with three-
dimensional (3D) out-of-plane X-wave localization in 2D
PCs [10]. Spatio-temporal waves considered in these
works rely on some speciﬁc models and often use ad-hoc
reduced coupled-mode equations,
approximations, e.g.
paraxiality, weak-coupling limit, continuum approxima-
tions. So far, a general framework to capture spatio-
temporal wave localization and propagation in PCs and

the derivation of a general wave equation, valid regard-
less of the speciﬁc system under investigation and with a
wide range of applicability, is still lacking.
The aim of this work is to provide a general analytical
framework to study spatio-temporal wave propagation in
2D and 3D PCs based on the use of Wannier-functions,
which have been introduced in the context of PCs to
treat localized modes, such as the bound states of im-
purities or lattice defects [13, 14]. A general asymptotic
analysis of the envelope equation for the Wannier func-
tions allows one to capture the existence and properties
of localized nonspreading wavepackets in PCs in terms
of localized solutions of canonical wave equations, such
as the Schr¨odinger equation, the Helmholtz equation and
the Klein-Gordon equation.

II. WANNIER FUNCTION ENVELOPE
EQUATION

The starting point of the analysis is provided by the
vectorial wave equation for the magnetic ﬁeld H =
H(r, t) in a PC with a periodic relative dielectric con-
stant ǫ(r),

where c is the speed of light in vacuum. To study the
propagation of a spatio-temporal wavepacket, we can
adopt the method of the Wannier function expansion,
which is commonplace in the study of the quasi-classical
electron dynamics in solids [15, 16] and recently ap-
plied to study localized modes and defect structures in
PCs with defects [13, 14]. We refer explicitly to a 3D
PC structure, however a similar analysis can be devel-
oped for a 2D PC. Let us ﬁrst consider the monochro-
matic Bloch-type solutions to Eq.(1) at frequency ω,
H(r, t) = Hk,n(r) exp(−iωt), where k lies in the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone of the reciprocal k space, ω = ωn(k) is
the dispersion curve for the n-th band, and Hk,n(r) are
the band modes, satisfying the condition Hk,n(r + R) =
Hk,n(r) exp(ik · R) for any lattice vector R of the peri-
odic dielectric function. The Bloch functions Hk,n(r) are
normalized such that hHk′,n′ |Hk,ni = VBZ δn,n′δ(k′ −k),
where VBZ = (2π)3/V is the volume of the ﬁrst Brillouin

2

zone in the reciprocal space and V is the volume of the
real-space unit cell. For each band of the PC, one can
construct a Wannier function Wn(r) as a localized su-
perposition of Bloch functions of the band according to:

wavepacket [Eq.(4)], as given by Eq.(6), is exact, and for
any band of the PC an envelope equation can be writ-
ten, the speciﬁc details of the band entering both in the
dispersion curve ω2
n(k) and in the shape of the corre-
sponding Wannier function Wn [Eq.(2)].

Wn(r) =

dk Hk,n(r).

(2)

In the superposition, the phase of Bloch functions Hk,n
can be chosen such that the Wannier function Wn(r)
is strongly localized around r = 0 with an exponential
decay far from r = 0. The Wannier functions satisfy the
orthogonality conditions hWn′(r − R′)|Wn(r − R)i =
δn,n′δR,R′, and the following relationship can be easily
proven:

n(k) =

wavepacket, which is a solution to Eq.(1), as a super-
P
position of translated Wannier functions localized at the
diﬀerent lattice points R of the periodic structure, with
amplitudes f (R, t) that depend on the lattice point R
and can vary in time, i.e. we set:

i.e.

H(r, t) =

f (R, t)Wn(r − R).

Note that, as we consider a pure periodic structure with-
out defects and neglect perturbation terms in Eq.(1) (e.g.
nonlinearities), coupling among diﬀerent bands does not
occur and in Eq.(4) the sum can be taken over a sin-
gle band, of index n. Coupled-mode equations for the
temporal evolution of the amplitudes f (R, t) of Wannier
functions at diﬀerent lattice points can be obtained af-
ter substitution of Eq.(4) into Eq.(1), taking the scalar
product with Wn(r − R) and using the orthogonality
conditions of Wannier functions, together with Eq.(3).
One obtains:

(5)

The solution to the coupled-mode equations (5) can be
expressed as f (R, t) = f (r = R, t), where the continuous
function f (r, t) of space r and time t satisﬁes the partial
diﬀerential equation:

III. SPATIAL AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL
LOCALIZED WAVES

The most general solution to the Wannier-function en-
velope equation (6) is given by a superposition of func-
tions ψ(r, ±t), where ψ(r, t) is a solution to the wave
equation:

i

∂ψ
∂t

= ωn(−i∇r)ψ.

(7)

We are know interested on the search for localized so-
lutions to Eq.(7) such that |ψ| corresponds to a wave
propagating undistorted with a group velocity vg. To
this aim, let us set ψ(r, t) = g(r, t) exp(ik0 − iΩt), where
k0 is chosen inside the ﬁrst Brillouin zone in the recipro-
cal space and the frequency Ω is chosen close to (but not
necessarily coincident with) ω0 = ωn(k0). The envelope
g then satisﬁes the wave equation

i

∂g
∂t

= [ωn(k0 − i∇r) − Ω] g.

(8)

We ﬁrst note that,
if g varies slowly with respect to
the spatial variables r, at leading order one can ex-
pand ωn(k0 − i∇r) up to ﬁrst order around k0; tak-
ing Ω = ω0, one obtains ∂g/∂t + ∇kωn · ∇rg = 0, i.e.
one retrieves the well-known result for which an arbitrary
3D spatially-localized wavepacket travels undistorted, at
leading order, with a group velocity given by ∇kωn. Nev-
ertheless, higher-order terms are generally responsible for
wavepacket spreading, both in space and time. In order
to ﬁnd propagation-invariant envelope waves even when
dispersive terms are accounted for, let us assume, without
loss of generality, that (∂ωn/∂ky)k0 = (∂ωn/∂kz)k0 = 0,
i.e. let us choose the orientation of the x axis such that
the wavepacket group velocity ∇kωn is directed along
this axis, and let us look for a propagation-invariant
solution to Eq.(8) of the form g = g(x1, x2, x3), with
x1 = x − vgt, x2 = y and x3 = z, traveling along the x
axis with a group velocity vg, which is left undetermined
at this stage. The function g then satisﬁes the following
equation:

−ivg

= [ωn(k0 − i∇x) − Ω] g,

(9)

∂2f (r, t)

∂t2 + ω

n(−i∇r)f (z, t) = 0,

(6)

whose solution can be written formally as:

and ω2
n(−i∇r) is the operator obtained after the sub-
stitution k → −i∇r in the Fourier expansion of ω2
n(k).
It should be noted that the diﬀerential equation for
the continuous envelope f (r, t) of the Wannier function

g(x1, x2, x3) =

dQ2dQ3 G(Q2, Q3) exp(iQ · x). (10)

In Eq.(10), x = (x1 = x − vgt, x2 = y, x3 = z), Q =
(Q1, Q2, Q3), G is an arbitrary spectral amplitude, and

∂g
∂x1

Z

Q1 = Q1(Q2, Q3) is implicitly deﬁned by the following
dispersion relation:

ωn(k0 + Q) − Ω − vgQ1 = 0.

(11)

To avoid the occurrence of evanescent (exponentially-
growing) waves, the integral in Eq.(10) is extended over
the values of (Q2, Q3) such that Q1, obtained after solv-
ing Eq.(11), turns out to be real-valued. We note that,
for an arbitrary spectral amplitude G, Eq.(10) represents
an exact solution of the Wannier-function envelope equa-
tion, which propagates undistorted with a group veloc-
ity vg, once the proper band dispersion curve ωn(k) of
the PC and corresponding dispersion relation (11) are
computed, e.g. by numerical methods. For some spe-
ciﬁc choices of the spectral amplitude G, in addition to
undistorted wave propagation a certain degree of spatio-
temporal wave localization can be obtained. It is worth
to get some explicit examples, though approximate, of
such 3D localized waves, admitting the integral repre-
sentation given by Eq.(10), and relate them to already
known localized solutions to canonical wave equations [2].
To this aim, we develop an asymptotic analysis of Eq.(11)
by assuming that the spectral amplitude G is nonvanish-
ing in a narrow interval around Q2 = Q3 = 0, so that, for
Ω close to ω0, the value of Q1, as obtained form Eq.(11),
is also close to Q1 = 0. In this case, an approximate ex-
pression for the dispersion relation Q1 = Q1(Q2, Q3) can
be obtained by expanding in Eq.(11) the band dispersion
curve ωn(k0 + Q) at around k0. We should distinguish
two cases, depending on the value of the group velocity
vg, which is basically a free parameter in our analysis.
First case. The ﬁrst case corresponds to the choice of a
group velocity vg diﬀerent from (and enough far form)
∂ωn/∂kx. In this case, the leading-order terms entering
in Eq.(11) after a power expansion of ωn(k0 + Q) are
quadratic in Q2, Q3 and linear in Q1; precisely, one has:

where ki = kx,y,z for i = 1, 2, 3 and the derivatives of
the band dispersion curve are calculated at k = k0. If
the approximate expression of Q1, given Eq.(12), is intro-
duced into Eq.(10), one can easily show that the envelope
g(x1, x2, x3) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation:

where α2 and α3 are the eigenvalues of the 2 × 2 ma-
trix ∂2ωn/∂ki∂kj (i, j = 2, 3). 3D localized waves to
Eq.(14) are expressed in terms of well-known Gauss-
Hermite functions, which are in general anisotropic for
α2 6= α3. These 3D localized waves, which exist re-
gardless of the sign of α2 and α3, represent Gaussian-
like beams, with exponential localization in the trans-
verse (y, z) plane and algebraic localization, determined
by the beam Rayleigh range, in the longitudinal x di-
rection (and hence in time). These beams propagate
undistorted along the x direction with an arbitrary group
velocity vg, either subluminal or superluminal, provided
that vg 6= ∂ωn/∂kx. Such pulsed propagating Gaussian
beams represent an extension, in a PC structure, of sim-
ilar solutions found in vacuum (see [17] and references
therein). In particular, the special case vg = 0 leads to
stationary (monochromatic) Gaussian-like beams; note
that the condition vg 6= ∂ωn/∂kx implies that such
steady Gaussian beams do not exist in a PC close to a
bandgap edge, where ∂ωn/∂kx vanishes. Other solutions
to Eq.(14), leading to spatial 2D localized and monochro-
matic waves in the transverse (y, z) plane (but delocalized
in the longitudinal x direction), can be search in the form
g(x1, x2, x3) = s(x2, x3) exp(iλx1), where λ is a propa-
gation constant. If α2 and α3 have the same sign, the
function s(x2, x3) satisﬁes a 2D Helmholtz equation, ad-
mitting well-known Bessel-beam solutions in cylindrical
coordinates. For α2 6= α3, such solutions are anisotropic,
and again they represent a generalization to a PC of well-
known spatial Bessel beams in vacuum. If α2 and α3 have
opposite sign, one obtains a hyperbolic 2D equation (or,
equivalently, a 1D Klein-Gordon equation), which admits
of 2D X-type localized solutions involving modiﬁed Bessel
functions recently studied in [9] (see Eqs.(3a) and (4) of
Ref. [9]; see also [18]).
Second case. The second case corresponds to the choice
vg = ∂ωn/∂kx. In this case, the leading-order approxi-
mation to the dispersion relation [Eq.(11)] should include
also second-order derivatives with respect to x1 of the
band dispersion curve ωn(k0 + Q), yielding:

where the derivatives of the band dispersion curve are
calculated at k = k0. If the approximate expression of
Q1, implicitly deﬁned by the quadratic equation (15), is
introduced into Eq.(10), one can easily show that the
envelope g(x1, x2, x3) satisﬁes this time the diﬀerential
equation:

nal matrix that diagonalizes ∂2ωn/∂ki∂kj, Eq.(16) takes

where αi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the eigenvalues of the 3 × 3 ma-
trix ∂2ωn/∂ki∂kj (i, j = 1, 2, 3). The sign of the eigen-
values αi basically determines the elliptic or hyperbolic
character of Eq.(17), and hence the nature of their solu-
tions (see, e.g., [2]). If αi have the same sign, e.g. they
are positive, for Ω < ω0 Eq.(17) reduces, after a scal-
ing of axis length, to a 3D Helmholtz equation, which in
spherical coordinates admits of localized solutions in the
form of sinc-shaped waves (see, e.g., [2, 5]). If, conversely,
there is a sign discordance among the eigenvalues αi, one
obtains a 2D Klein-Gordon equation, which admits of
3D localized X-type waves which have been lengthly dis-
cussed in many works (see, e.g., [2, 6, 9] and references
therein).
In some special cases, one of the eigenvalues
αi may vanish, which may yield further nonspreading
wavepacket solutions. Notably, if α1 = 0, the solution
to Eq.(17) is given by g(x1, x2, x3) = h(x1)ϕ(x2, x3),
where h is an arbitrary function of x1 = x − vgt and
ϕ satisﬁes a 2D Helmoltz equation for α2α3 > 0, ad-
mitting Bessel beam solutions, or a 1D Klein-Gordon
equation for α2α3 < 0, admitting 2D X-type solutions.
For these special solutions a cancellation of temporal dis-
persion is attained. As the former case (α2α3 > 0) ex-
tends to a PC structure the so-called pulsed Bessel beams
found in homogeneous dispersive media [3], the latter
case (α2α3 < 0) is rather peculiar for a PC structure,
which realizes a bi-diﬀractive propagation regime [9], i.e.

positive and negative diﬀraction along the two transverse
directions y and z. Instead of pulses with a transverse
Bessel beam proﬁle, in this case one obtains a transverse
X-shaped beam with an arbitrary longitudinal (tempo-
ral) proﬁle that propagates without spreading.
As a ﬁnal remark, we note that, though our analysis has
been focused to a 3D PC, similar results can be obtained
mutatis mutandis for the lower-dimensional case of a 2D
PC. In this case, not considering out-of-plane propaga-
tion, the ﬁelds depend solely on the two spatial variables
x and y deﬁning the PC plane, and Eqs.(14) and (17) are
still valid provided that the terms involving the deriva-
tives with respect to the x3 = z coordinate are dropped.
In this case, Eq.(14) corresponds to a 1D Schr¨odinger
equation, whereas Eq.(17) corresponds to either a 2D
Helmholtz equation or to a 1D Klein-Gordon equation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, a general analysis of wavepacket propa-
gation in PCs, based on a Wannier function expansion
approach, has been presented, and an exact envelope
equation describing undistorted propagation of spatio-
temporal localized waves has been derived. An asymp-
totic analysis of the envelope equation shows that a wide
class of localized (either spatial or spatio-temporal) waves
exist, including propagating Gaussian beams, 2D and 3D
X-type waves, sinc-shaped waves, pulsed Bessel beams
and pulsed 2D X waves, some of which have been recently
studied with reference to some speciﬁc models [8, 9].

Abstract

We analytically study the linear propagation of arbitrarily shaped light-pulses through an ab-

sorbing medium with a narrow transparency-window or through a resonant amplifying medium.

We point out that, under certain general conditions, the pulse acquires a nearly Gaussian shape,

irrespective of its initial shape and of the spectral proﬁle of the line. We explicitly derive in this

case the pulse parameters, including its skewness responsible for a deviation of the delay of the

pulse maximum from the group delay. We illustrate our general results by analysing the slow-light

experiments having demonstrated the largest fractional pulse-delays.

INTRODUCTION

The principle underlying most of the slow-light experiments is to exploit the steep normal

dispersion of the refractive index associated with a pronounced peak in the transmission of

the medium and the correlative reduction of the group velocity. The situation where the

resulting time-delay of the light-pulse is large compared to its duration and can be controlled

by an external laser ﬁeld is of special importance for potential applications, especially in

the domain of high-speed all-optical signal-processing. Harris and his co-workers [1, 2]

opened the way to such experiments by exploiting the phenomenon of electromagnetically

induced transparency (EIT) allowing one to create a narrow transparency-window in an

otherwise optically thick atomic vapour. Using a true-shape detection of the pulses, they

demonstrated propagation velocities as slow as c/165 and group delays τg as long as 4.6 τin

where c and τin are respectively the velocity of the light in vacuum and the full width at

half-maximum (FWHM) of the intensity-proﬁle of the incident pulse. Much slower velocities

have been attained in subsequent EIT experiments (for reviews see, e.g., [3, 4, 5]) and

in experiments involving coherent population oscillations [6] or other processes to induce

a transparency-window in an absorbing medium.

It is however worth noticing that only

few of these experiments, all using EIT, have succeeded in giving direct demonstrations of

fractional delays τg/τin exceeding unity [2, 7, 8]. Theoretical discussions on the maximum

time-delays attainable in such experiments can be found in [1, 9, 10]. A diﬀerent way to

achieve a system with a controllable transmission-peak is to optically induce a resonant

gain in a transparent medium [11]. Initially proposed by Gauthier [12], the arrangement

involving stimulated Brillouin scattering [13, 14, 15, 16] seems particularly attractive from

the viewpoint of the above mentioned applications. The Brillouin gain is indeed directly

implemented on an optical ﬁbre and there are no severe constraints in the choice of the

operating wavelength. The group delay τg has already been controlled on a range of 3.6 τin

by this technique [15]. Note that preliminary experiments using a Raman ﬁbre ampliﬁer

have also been achieved [17].

The purpose of our paper is to provide analytical results on the propagation of arbitrarily

shaped pulses, the central frequency of which coincides with that of a pronounced maximum

in the medium-transmission. We examine more speciﬁcally the case where the resulting time-

delays of the pulses are large compared to their duration. Our study applies in particular but

2

not exclusively to the above mentioned systems. Our approach follows in part and extends

that of Bukhman [18] with a special attention paid to the connection of the theoretical

results with the experiments.

II. GENERAL ANALYSIS

We denote by ein(t) and eout(t) the slowly-varying envelopes of the incident and trans-

mitted pulses and by Ein(Ω) =

tion H(Ω), Fourier transform of h(t). The input/output relation or transfer equation reads

eout(t) = h(t)

ein(t) in the time-domain or Eout(Ω) = H(Ω)Ein(Ω) in the frequency-domain

⊗

[19]. We assume that the incident pulse has a ﬁnite energy, that it is not chirped (ein(t) real

and positive) and that h(t) is also real. The local response of the medium is characterised

by the complex gain-factor Γ(Ω) = ln [H(Ω)] whose real part F (Ω) and imaginary part Φ(Ω)

are respectively the logarithm of the medium amplitude-gain

shift. The condition imposed to h(t) implies that H(

H(Ω)
|

and the induced phase
Ω) = H ∗(Ω) and thus that F (Ω) and

|

−

Φ(Ω) are respectively even and odd functions of Ω. This has the advantage of eliminating

the lowest-order pulse-distortions resulting from the gain-slope and from the group velocity

dispersion at the frequency ω0 of the optical carrier (Ω = 0). Moreover the medium is then

entirely characterised by the single real function h(t). In order to have simple expressions

we use for ein(t) a time origin located at the pulse centre-of-gravity and for eout(t) a time

origin retarded by the transit time at the group velocity outside the frequency-domain of

high-dispersion (local time picture). The time delays considered hereafter are thus only

those originating in the high-dispersion region.

General properties of the transmitted pulse can be derived by Fourier analysis. Let x(t)

be any of the real functions ein(t), h(t) or eout(t) and X(Ω) its Fourier transform. We

remark that X(0) =

∞
−∞ x(t)dt and, following an usual procedure in probability theory [20],

we characterise X(Ω) by its cumulants κn, such that

For H(Ω), we see that the cumulants are simply related to the coeﬃcients of the series

This conﬁrms that large group delays are achieved when the gain

maximum at Ω = 0. We have then κ2 > 0.

Coming back to the general problem, we characterise the time function x(t) by its

is that the moments

Moreover the transfer equation immediately leads to the relations Eout(0) = H0Ein(0) and

κn,out = κn,in + κn where, as in all our paper, the indexes in, out and the absence of index

respectively refer to the incident pulse, the transmitted pulse and the transfer-function or

impulse response of the medium. With our choice of time origin,

of-gravity equals the group delay [22]. The two last ones specify how the rms duration and

the asymmetry of the incident pulse are modiﬁed by the medium. All these results are valid

provided that the involved moments are ﬁnite [19].

III. ANALYTIC EXPRESSIONS OF THE MEDIUM IMPULSE-RESPONSE

In order to obtain a complete information on the shape and the amplitude of the trans-

mitted pulse, we obviously have to specify the complex gain-factor Γ(Ω) of the medium. For

4

the medium with a resonant gain, it reads

Γ(Ω) = pN (Ω)G/2

A/2

−

(3)

where pN (Ω) is the normalised complex proﬁle of the gain-line (pN (0) = 1), G is the gain

parameter for the intensity [14] and A stands for the attenuation introduced to reduce the

eﬀects of the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission [15] and/or to normalise the overall gain of the

system. G = g0L where g0(resp.L) is the resonance gain-coeﬃcient (resp. the thickness) of

the medium. The previous expression of Γ(Ω) also holds for an absorbing medium with a

transparency-window when the absorption background is assumed to be inﬁnitely wide. We

then get Γ(Ω) =

f pN (Ω)]α0L/2 where α0 is the background absorption-coeﬃcient,

[1

−

−

1 speciﬁes the depth of the transparency-window [9] and pN (Ω) is the normalised

f

≤

complex proﬁle of the line associated with the transparency-window. By putting G = f α0L

and A = α0L , we actually retrieve the expression of Γ(Ω) obtained for a gain medium. In

both types of experiments, G and A are generally comparable in order that the resonance
gain H0 = eG/2−A/2 is close to 1 or, at least, does not diﬀer too strongly from 1. Anyway the
intensity-transmission on resonance exceeds its value far from resonance by the factor eG.

To go beyond, it seems necessary to explicit the proﬁle pN (Ω). We ﬁrst consider the

reference case where pN (Ω) is associated with a Lorentzian line.
It then reads pN (Ω) =
1/(1+iΩ/γ) where γ is the half-width of the line [22] and we immediately get κn = Gn!/(2γn)
with in particular κ1 = τg = G/(2γ), κ2 = σ2 = G/γ2 and thus τg = σ√G/2. The last

relation shows that achieving substantial fractional delays τg/σ requires that G

quite remarkable property of the Lorentzian case is that the impulse response has an exact

analytical expression. This result has been obtained by Crisp in a general study on the

propagation of small-area pulses in absorbing and amplifying media [23] but it can easily be

retrieved from H(Ω) by using standard procedures of Laplace transforms [20]. One get

h(t) = e−A/2δ(t) + e−A/2γG

where δ(t), I1(u) and U(t) respectively designate the Dirac function, the 1st order modiﬁed
Bessel function and the unit step function. The 1st term hi(t) in h(t) results from the con-
stant value e−A/2 of H(Ω) far from resonance. This part of the response is instantaneous

in our local time picture and only the 2nd term hd(t), directly associated with the trans-
mission peak, contribute to the delay. The areas of hi(t) and hd(t) are respectively e−A/2

of the convolution of n deterministic functions [19]. It applies to our case by splitting the

medium in n cascaded sections, h(t) being then the convolution of the impulse responses

of each section. According to this analysis, one may expect that the normal form h(2)(t)

impulse responses are both close to the normal form h(2)(t). Similar results (not shown) are

obtained with other line-proﬁles, including the EIT proﬁle (see hereafter).

When the gain parameter is large but not very large, a better approximation of the

impulse response is obtained by considering the eﬀect of the 3rd cumulant κ3, equal to

IV. NORMAL FORM OF THE TRANSMITTED PULSE

The impulse response being known, the envelope of the transmitted pulse is given by

the relation eout(t) = h(t)

FIG. 4: Propagation of a square-shaped (full line) and a Gaussian-shaped (dashed line) light-pulse

with large delay and low distortion. The parameters are chosen in order that σ = σin/7, τg = 7σin

and H0 = 1. The envelopes of the input pulses are given for reference. The time unit is the common

rms duration σin of the two incident pulses. As expected, the distortion of the Gaussian-shaped

pulse is negligible and there is only a slight softening of the rise and of the fall of the square-shaped

pulse.

However most of the direct demonstrations of large fractional pulse delays have been

achieved with smaller gain parameters, typically ranging from 10 to 100, and with incident

pulses whose rms duration σin is comparable to and often smaller than σ. Substantial

pulse-reshaping is then expected. Suppose ﬁrst that the normal form h(2)(t) provides a good

approximation of the impulse response and that the incident pulse is Gaussian-shaped. We

have then ein(t) = exp(

t2/2σ2) and eout(t), convolution of two Gaussian functions, is itself
in + σ2 . The eﬀect
−
of the medium on the light-pulse is simply to delay its maximum exactly by the group delay,

Gaussian. It reads eout(t) = H0(σin/σout) exp(

order to respect the area theorem [23]. Since this point is often overlooked, we stress that

the broadening mechanism radically diﬀers from that occurring in standard optical ﬁbres

[25]. It originates in the 2nd order gain-dispersion instead of in the group-velocity dispersion

and the pulse envelope keeps real (no phase modulation or frequency chirping).

In fact,

provided that σin be smaller than or comparable to σ and that

< 1, eout(t) is well

approximated by a Gaussian function whatever the shape of the incident pulse is. This is

again a consequence of the central limit theorem, the response eout(t) being obtained by an

extra convolution added to those used to build h(t). The conditions on σin and

originate

in the requirement that all the terms to convolute should have moments of the same order of

This result extends the previous one and shows that incident pulses having diﬀerent shapes

but the same area Sin and the same variance σin are reshaped in the medium to give

approximately the same Gaussian-shaped pulse (Fig.5). From an experimental viewpoint,

the dramatic reshaping of a square-shaped pulse has been clearly demonstrated (but not

commented on) by Turukhin et al. [8] in their EIT experiment in a solid (see their ﬁgure 2c

for 0 probe detuning). Pulse reshaping is also apparent in the Brillouin scattering experiment

by Song et al. [13] where a ﬂat-topped pulse is actually transformed in a gaussian-like pulse

(see their ﬁgure 4 and compare the shapes obtained for gains 0dB and 30dB).

A more precise approximation e(3)

out(t) of eout(t) can be obtained by taking into account
the eﬀect of the 3rd order cumulants. Using the approach already used to determine h(3)(t),

V. EFFECT OF THE TRANSMISSION BACKGROUND

In the previous calculations, we have not taken into account the eﬀect of the instantaneous
part hi(t) = e−A/2δ(t) of the impulse response, arguing that its area is small compared to
that of the delayed part. As a matter of fact, hi(t) originates a contribution e−A/2ein(t) to
eout(t), the amplitude of which is roughly eG/2σin/σout times smaller than that of the main

part and is thus actually negligible in every case of substantial delay (G

of the same order of magnitude). We should however remark that this result lies on the

assumption that the transmission peak is put on an uniform background.

We will now examine the case where the transmission background is not uniform. This

Without any approximation, the partial fraction decomposition of Γ(Ω) allows us to

write the transfer-function of the medium as a product of simpler functions, namely

H(Ω) = H1(Ω)H2(Ω) with Hj(Ω) = exp [Cj/ (iΩ + γj)]. According to the control power,
the parameters C1, C2, γ1 and γ2 are real or complex. When Ωs < (γba −

respectively an absorption-line and a narrower gain-line. It is also equivalent to a cascade

They have the same intensity and the same width, but they are hybrid in the sense that,

due to the complex nature of C1 and C2, their absorption and dispersion proﬁles are both

the sum of an absorption-like and a dispersion-like proﬁle. We incidentally note that the

parameters used to obtain the ﬁgure 8 in [4] correspond to such a situation. In all cases, the

impulse responses associated to H1(Ω) and H2(Ω) have analytical expressions [23, 26] and

the impulse response h(t) of the medium is their convolution product. This general analysis

is satisfactory from a formal viewpoint. It provides some physical insight into the EIT mech-

anisms but is not really operational to determine the shape of the transmitted pulse. From

this viewpoint, a fruitful approach consists in exploiting the fact that the medium is opaque

except in the narrow region of induced transparency and in the far wings of the background

absorption-line (Fig.7). In the ﬁrst region, H(Ω) is well approximated by the forms H (2)(Ω)

short transients when ein(t) comprises localised defects. As expected and recently discussed

about the EIT experiments [27], the front of these transients will propagate at the velocity

Its initial amplitude is

transients exceeds that of the smooth part of eout(t). In a real experiment however the ﬁnite

values of the rise and fall times of the incident pulse and of the detection bandwidth will

generally limit the importance of the transients. By a deliberate reduction of the detection

bandwidth, it is even possible to bring their intensity to a very low level without signiﬁcantly

aﬀecting the delayed Gaussian-like part (see inset of Fig.9).

regions are much wider that the transparency-window (iii) the transfer-function does not

signiﬁcantly deviate from the normal form in the transparency-window. The ﬁrst condition

(i) is generally met even when Γ(Ω) is not Lorentzian in its central part. Anyway, it is not

essential.

If it is not met, the detailed shape of the transients is modiﬁed but not their

main features (instantaneous transmission, duration proportional to the inverse of the spec-

tral width of the opaque regions). The conditions (ii) and (iii), which are closely related,

are met in the EIT experiments when the medium transmission is good at the frequency

of the optical carrier (see before) but this is not always suﬃcient. As a counter-example

we consider the experiment achieved by Tanaka et al. in an atomic vapour with a natural

transparency-window between two strong absorption lines [29]. The complex gain-factor

requires to involve much larger absorption-parameters and to accept a lower transmission.

much larger than the delayed part of the transmitted pulse and would obscure it. Moreover,

due to the narrowness of the opaque regions, the time scales of the transients and of the

delayed part do not considerably diﬀer and it is thus impossible to ﬁlter out the former

without denaturing the latter.

VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Privileging the time-domain analysis, we have studied the linear propagation of light

pulses, the frequency of which coincides with that of a pronounced maximum in the trans-

mission of the medium. An important point is that substantial pulse-delays are only attained

when the corresponding transmission exceeds the minimum one by a very large factor C

(contrast). The impulse response of the medium then tends to a normal (Gaussian) form,

irrespective of the line proﬁle associated with the transmission peak. The propagation of

arbitrarily shaped light-pulses with signiﬁcant delays and low distortion is possible when the

rms duration σ of the medium impulse-response is small compared to that of the incident

pulse (σin), which should itself be small compared to the group delay τg. The fulﬁlment

of this double condition requires systems where C is extremely large, typically several tens

of thousands of dB in a logarithmic scale. Systems with such contrast have actually been

used [2] but, in most slow-light experiments, C ranges from 30 to 600 dB. Signiﬁcant frac-

tional time-delays τg/σin keep attainable with such values of C by using incident pulses, the

duration of which is comparable to or smaller than σ. As the medium impulse-response,

the transmitted pulse then tends to acquire a normal (Gaussian) shape whatever its initial

shape is. This reshaping is particularly striking when the incident pulse is square-shaped

but is reduced to a simple broadening when the latter is itself Gaussian-shaped. Despite

its asymptotic character, the normal form generally provides a good approximation of the

shape of the transmitted pulse. More precise shapes are obtained by a perturbation method,

allowing us in particular to specify how much the delay of the pulse-maximum deviates from

the group delay.

All these results have been ﬁrst established by assuming that the transmission peak is

put on an uniform background. We have shown that they also apply when the transmission

peak is associated with a transparency window in an absorption-proﬁle of ﬁnite width.

18

This however requires that the nearly opaque regions ﬂanking the transparency window be

considerably wider than the latter. Other things being equal, there are then no diﬀerences

between the cases of uniform and non uniform transmission-backgrounds, at least when the

envelope of the incident pulse is smooth. Conversely localised defects in this envelope will

be responsible for the generation of very short transients which complement the normal

(Gaussian) part of the signal. The front of the transients is instantaneously propagated in

our local time picture (that is at the velocity c in a dilute sample). In extreme cases, their

amplitude may be comparable to that of the delayed signal but, due to their location and

their duration, they can easily be eliminated without altering the latter.

The slow and fast light experiments have a common feature. In both cases, the observation

of signiﬁcant eﬀects requires media with a very large contrast between the maximum and the

minimum of transmission. This results from the causality principle and implies severe limits

to the eﬀects attainable in fast-light experiments, whatever the involved system is [30]. From

this viewpoint the slow-light case is obviously less pathologic and the constraints, although

real, are much softer.

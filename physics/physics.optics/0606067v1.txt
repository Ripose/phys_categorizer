Abstract

We show that a Rubidium vapor can be produced within the core of a photonic band-gap ﬁber

yielding an optical depth in excess of 2000. Our technique for producing the vapor is based

on coating the inner walls of the ﬁber core with an organosilane and using light-induced atomic

desorption to release Rb atoms into the core. We develop a model to describe the dynamics of

the atomic density, and as an initial demonstration of the potential of this system for supporting

ultra-low-level nonlinear optical interactions, we perform electromagnetically-induced transparency

with control-ﬁeld powers in the nanowatt regime, which represents more than a 1000-fold reduction

from the power required for bulk, focused geometries.

Remarkable advances have been made in the past decade in generating and controlling

quantum states of light using atomic vapors, including the realization of on-demand single-

photon sources [1], manipulation of photonic states [2], and storage and retrieval of the states

with high ﬁdelity [3, 4]. Much of the motivation for these eﬀorts has been to realize a practical

quantum network [5].

In most cases, the underlying optical process for realizing these

schemes has been the phenomenon of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) [6] in

which a coherent superposition of atomic states is created by a strong control ﬁeld such that

an optically thick atomic ensemble is rendered transparent to a weak, resonant probe ﬁeld.

The concept of EIT has been applied and expanded to schemes that allow two extremely weak

ﬁelds, which in principle can consist of single photon pulses, to strongly interact [7, 8, 9, 10].

Practical implementation of these proposals in which a single photon can switch another

photon will lead to the realization of critical components (e.g., a quantum phase gate) for

quantum information applications [11].

The two generic requirements to achieve EIT-based, ultralow-level optical interactions

are: 1) a large optical depth κ = nLσ, where n is the density of the atomic sample of length

L, and σ is the atomic absorption cross-section, and 2) conﬁnement of the light beams to

an area A comparable to the atomic scattering cross-section of 3λ2/2π [8, 9, 10, 12]. For

example, the phase shift due to nonlinear interactions between few photon-pulses in the

proposed scheme of Andr´e et al. [10] and the inverse of the critical power required to switch

a signal ﬁeld in the four-level scheme of Harris and Yamamoto [8] are each proportional to

κ/A. In order to maximize the optical depth, a natural choice for the atomic ensemble is an

alkali atom due to its relatively simple energy-level structure and its large σ as compared to,

for example, molecules with ro-vibrational transitions [13]. There is a limit on how much κ

can be increased by increasing the density n since this will result in undesirable dephasing

eﬀects due to atomic collisions. Alternatively, increasing the length L of the atomic sample

can further enhance the optical depth. However, in a bulk focused geometry, this length L

is limited to the Rayleigh length, which can only be increased by a corresponding increase

in beam area A [5, 10], and thus no change in the quantity κ/A.

In this Letter, we realize a new experimental geometry for alkali vapors that overcomes

the limitations of bulk focused geometries by using light-induced atomic desorption (LIAD)

to produce controllable densities of Rb atoms within a suitably coated core of a photonic

band-gap ﬁber (PBGF). The photonic crystal structure [14] surrounding the core of a PBGF

[see Fig. 1(a)] provides an unmatched ability to tightly conﬁne light with a gas in a region

a few microns in diameter over meter-long distances, and thus provides an ideal system to

perform nonlinear optics at extremely low light levels [10, 12]. Recent demonstrations of

nonlinear optical processes in PBGFs using gases with relatively weak nonlinearities has led

to the observation of low-threshold stimulated Raman scattering [15], high-power soliton

generation [16], and coherent resonant interactions with molecules [13, 17]. By using a gas

such as an alkali vapor with a strong nonlinear optical response, such a ﬁber system can

form a the basis for creation, manipulation, storage and transmission of photonic states in

a ﬁber geometry. However up until now, the ability to inject alkali atoms into PBGFs has

eluded researchers due to the strong interaction of the vapor with silica walls of the ﬁber.

The primary challenge to creating a useful vapor of Rb atoms within a PBGF is that Rb

3

vapor attacks and adheres to silica glass ﬁber walls through both physisorption, in which the

atoms stick to the surface for a ﬁnite time, and through chemisorption, in which the atoms

are lost to the wall [18]. These issues are particularly severe for a ﬁber with a core 6-µm

in diameter [19], which is a factor of 108 smaller than the atomic mean free path at room

temperature. Furthermore, for the fraction of atoms undergoing physisorption, the spin-

decoherence is large [20], which makes this system unsuitable as a practical quantum device.

However, treating a glass surface with paraﬃn or siloxane coatings [21] signiﬁcantly alters

the Rb-surface interaction properties such that the wall-induced dephasing rate decreases by

four orders of magnitude with a signiﬁcant reduction in chemisorption when compared with

that for uncoated silica glass walls [22]. In addition, atoms attached to such coated walls

can be released by sudden exposure to optical radiation through the non-thermal process

termed LIAD [23, 24, 25].

We applied these techniques to the ﬁber geometry by surface-modifying the core walls of

a PBGF {AIR-6-800, Crystal Fibre, with a core diameter of 6 µm [Fig.1(a)] and a bandgap

extending from 750 to 810 nm, chosen to accommodate the D1 and D2 lines of Rb at

795 nm and 780 nm, respectively [Fig.1(b)]} with a monolayer of C18H35 moieties by self-

assembly of octadecyldimethylmethoxysilane (ODMS) [26] via hydrolysis and condensation

from solution. This monolayer deposition technique avoids the clogging of the ﬁber core

that would occur for vacuum deposition of paraﬃn. The coating solution was introduced

from polyoleﬁn syringes to the PBGF via swaged PEEK ﬁxtures, , incubated in the core to

facilitate the monolayer deposition, and then ﬂushed out. As seen in Fig.1(b), the bandgap of

the ﬁber is preserved following the coating process. Following the monolayer deposition, the

ends of the PBGF of length Lf ib = 25 cm are placed in separate vacuum cells which are each

connected to an ultra-high vacuum system [Fig. 1(c)]. One of the cells [left cell, in Fig. 1(c)]

is subsequently exposed to natural Rb vapor, at a pressure of 10−6 Torr, and a beam from

an external-cavity diode laser reﬂected from a mirror inside the cell allows for monitoring

the Rb density n0 in the cell, which is kept at n0 = 2.1 × 1010 cm−3. Bulk condensation of

Rb vapor inside the ﬁber core is prevented by maintaining a constant temperature along the

entire length of the ﬁber. In the absence of LIAD, a ﬁnite fraction of atoms diﬀuse a length z

down the ﬁber core of radius rf ib, and this atomic ﬂux, which is proportional to the thermal

velocity, can be estimated in the Knudsen limit [27]. A steady-state condition, known as

”ripening”, is reached when this ﬂux equals the rate of adsorption to the wall surface at

4

z [25]. For the PBGF in which Lf ib/rf ib ≃ 105, this ripening time can be extremely large. For

simplicity, we rely on the Knudsen ﬂow for the atoms to diﬀuse down the core. However, the

atomic ﬂux can be signiﬁcantly enhanced with techniques such as light-induced drift [28] or

dipole-force guidance [19] into the core. The total number of atoms in the core is determined

by monitoring the transmission of a weak laser beam coupled to the core and by scanning

over the D1 transition. We take into account the density contribution due to the beam

path in the cell before the ﬁber [Fig. 1(c)] and ﬁt the resulting absorption trace to the

transmission coeﬃcient,

where n(z) is the atomic density at position z in the core, and the atomic cross-section

σ(v, γ, ω) of the transition is a function of the atomic velocity v, the homogeneous linewidth

γ, and the laser frequency ω. The cross-section is averaged over the Doppler proﬁle W (v).

From the ﬁt of the experimental trace to Eq. 1, we estimate that in the absence of LIAD

In our experiments, the intensity of the probe beam is maintained at 100 pW, which

is an order of magnitude lower than the measured saturation power of 3 nW in the core.

By coupling a desorbing beam counterpropagating to the probe beam into the core and

tuned far oﬀ resonance at 770 nm, we observe a dramatic increase in the total number of

atoms. Figure 2(a) shows that the atomic population undergoes a nearly instantaneous

increase by three orders of magnitude after the turn-on of the 1-mW desorbing beam, with

a maximum optical depth in excess of 2000. While a recent experiment [29] has reported

Rb desorption from porous silica, we have not observed measurable desorption in uncoated

ﬁbers. From the ﬁtted absorption proﬁle, we estimate a homogeneous linewidth of γ =

96 MHz for the F = 1 → F ′ = 1, 2 transitions. The broadening associated with the

dipole dephasing of the atoms colliding with core wall can be estimated from the wall-

collisional frequency ¯v/2rf ib ≃85 MHz, where ¯v is the thermal velocity, which suggests

that the dominant contribution to the homogeneous linewidth is due to the wall-collisional

dephasing as opposed to atomic collisional broadening. This is consistent with our data that

shows the linewidth to be nearly constant as a function of time as the density varies over

two orders of magnitude.

Variation of the absorption lineshapes at three diﬀerent times. The corresponding theoretically

As a result of the transient nature of the density of atoms within the core, application

of this ﬁber system to low-light-level nonlinear optics requires a basic understanding of the

dynamics of the desorbed atoms in order to determine the time window in which useful

interactions can be performed. We apply the following simple model [24, 25] to explain

most of the features of the observed density dynamics. The temporal evolution of the total

term is the contribution from the Nwall atoms stuck to the core walls. This increase consists

of two contributions: a light-independent thermal desorption rate γT and a light-induced

desorption rate, which is proportional to the intensity Id of the desorbing beam at the core

wall with a proportionality constant a. It is via this second process that the atomic density

and the optical depth of the system can be varied. The last factor in Eq. 2 represents the

relaxation of the atomic number to the steady-state value Ncell = n0Af ibLf ib at a rate ξ. An

equation similar to Eq. 2 is assumed for Nwall, where the ﬁrst two factors contribute with

opposite signs, leading to an increase and decrease of atoms stuck to the walls, respectively.

Fig. 3(a) shows a plot of variation in the atomic population for various exposures of the

desorbing beam of 60µW , together with a ﬁt of the adopted model. The model was ﬁtted

to the experiment up to time τB [Fig. 3(b)], and the subsequent comparison of the theory

to the experiment shows excellent agreement.

To demonstrate the potential of this system to facilitate nonlinear optics at low-light

levels, we investigate EIT in a V -type system with a probe at 100 pW and with control

powers as low as 10 nW; these control powers are smaller by more than a factor of 1000X

than what is typically used to achieve EIT in bulk geometries [30]. The probe is tuned

to the F = 2 → F ′ = 1 transition of the D1 line of 87Rb at 795 nm, and a control ﬁeld,
copropagating with the probe, is tuned to the F = 2 → F ′ = 3 transition of the D2 line

at 780 nm. For this particular level scheme [inset of Fig. 4(b)], optical pumping between

the hyperﬁne levels is avoided, since the F = 1 → F ′ = 3 transition is dipole forbidden.

Furthermore, the probe-ﬁeld saturation and the optical pumping between the magnetic

sublevels tend to cancel each other, and as a result the observed transparency is primarily

due to pure EIT [30]. To analyze this system, we solve the density-matrix equations for a

3-level V system in steady state, with level a as the ground state and with b and c as the

two excited states [Fig. 4(b)]. The coherence σca to ﬁrst order in the probe ﬁeld is given

part of the Doppler-averaged susceptibility, calculated from this coherence, is integrated over

Figure 4 shows results in which a 1-mW desorbing beam releases Rb atoms into the core,

and a series of probe transmission spectra are taken at ensuing time intervals. The time

(250 ms) to obtain a trace is chosen to be long compared to the atomic time scales (100’s

ns) but short compared to the time scales (secs) associated with the desorption dynamics

of the atomic density in the core. The input power of the probe ﬁeld is set to 100 pW,

and that of the control ﬁeld is varied from 10 nW to 3 µW. Figure 4(a) shows a typical

trace of the probe ﬁeld transmission in presence of a 361-nW control ﬁeld, together with

the corresponding theoretical ﬁt as calculated from Eq. (3). Using the ﬁtting procedure

described in [13], we estimate a decay rate for the coherence between the two upper states

[ Fig 2(a)]. At higher powers or for transitions in which optical pumping and saturation

eﬀects contribute, larger than 90% transparencies are observed [see inset of Fig. 4(a)].

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique to create a signiﬁcant density of

9

Rubidium vapor in the core of a PBGF and as a proof of concept, we have demonstrated EIT

in this system with a control power as low as 10 nW which represents more than a factor

of 107 reduction, as compared to acetylene-based EIT in PBGF [13, 17]. Such a system

represents a new experimental geometry for performing nonlinear optics at extremely low

light levels due to its unmatched combination of strong light conﬁnement and long interaction

lengths with atoms of large optical cross-section.

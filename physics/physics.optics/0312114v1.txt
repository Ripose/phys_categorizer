Abstract: We present a new interferometric technique for measuring
Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and Second Harmonic
Generation (SHG) signals. Heterodyne detection is employed to increase
the sensitivity in both CARS and SHG signal detection, which can also be
extended to different coherent processes. The exploitation of the mentioned
optical nonlinearities for molecular contrast enhancement
in Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT) is presented. Numerical simulations for
both coherent nonlinear processes are performed in order to determine
the properties of the signal expected at the exit of the described nonlinear
interferometer.

Introduction

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging biomedical imaging technology that has
been applied to a wide range of biological, medical, and materials investigations. OCT was ﬁrst
developed in the early 1990s for noninvasive imaging of biological tissue [1] and is capable of
imaging tissue microstructures at near histological resolutions [2]. Axial resolution of 10 m m
is common for standard OCT, where for ultrahigh resolution OCT, an axial resolution in the 1
m m range has been recently achieved using broadband-continuum generation from a photonic
crystal ﬁber [3].

The advantages of OCT in biomedical imaging, compared to other imaging techniques, are
quite numerous [4]. In particular, OCT can provide imaging resolutions that approach those of
conventional histopathology and can be performed in situ [4]. Despite its advantages, a serious
drawback to OCT is that the linear scattering properties of pathological tissue probed by OCT
are often morphologically and/or optically similar to the scattering properties of normal tissue.
For example, although morphological differences between normal and neoplastic tissues may
be obvious at later stages of tumor development, it is frequently difﬁcult to optically detect
early-stage tumors [5].

This implies a need for novel contrast enhancing mechanisms for OCT. Examples of meth-
ods that have been recently developed, include: spectroscopic OCT [6], pump and probe tech-
niques [7], and the use of engineered microspheres [5] or microbubbles [8]. Spectroscopic OCT
(SOCT) measures the spectral absorption from tissues by measuring the spectral differences
between the source and the backscattered interference signal to provide information about the
properties of the scatterers in the sample. However, this technique is limited to the identiﬁca-
tion of scatterers that have absorption within the bandwidth of the optical source. Pump and
probe contrast enhancement for OCT imaging relies on transient absorptions in the sample un-

der investigation that are induced by an external pump beam. Unfortunately it is necessary in
most cases to introduce different contrast agents depending on the excitation source and on the
transient spectra of the molecules under investigation [7]. An alternative way to obtain contrast
enhancement in OCT includes the use of exogenous contrast agents such as engineered micro-
spheres. These microspheres can be targeted to cell receptors and change the optical scattering
or absorption characteristics in selected regions, providing molecular speciﬁc contrast [5].

As clearly evidenced above, most of the current methods (if not all) that are currently used to
enhance contrast imaging in OCT require the presence of a contrast agent, which can modify the
biology under investigation. It follows there is a need for new techniques that could help elim-
inate this limitation. In this paper, we propose and present new methods to achieve enhanced
OCT contrast, exploiting optical nonlinearities. The nonlinear effects on which we focus in this
work in particular are Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and Second Harmonic
Generation (SHG), but the general idea could be easily extended to other nonlinear effects
such as Third Harmonic Generation (THG), Coherent Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CSRS),
and stimulated emission in active materials (i.e. InGaAs, GaAs based materials, etc.).

2. CARS contrast enhancement

2.1. Theory

It is well known that the nonlinear polarization for a material can be expressed as a function of
the incident electric ﬁeld vector ¯E:

¯P = e 0

c (1)

(cid:18)

¯E + c (2) : ¯E ¯E + c (3) ... ¯E ¯E ¯E + . . .
(cid:19)

·

(1)

with ¯P the induced polarization, c (n) the n-th order nonlinear susceptibility, and e 0 the vacuum
permittivity. This implies that for high intensities (i.e. in a nonlinear regime) the induced po-
larization is no longer directly proportional to the incoming electric ﬁeld vector ¯E. Usually the
ﬁrst term c (1) represents the main contribution to ¯P and describes linear effects as absorption
or reﬂection. The second term is responsible for nonlinear effects like SHG and sum-frequency
generation which we will consider in Sect. 3. The third term c (3) is responsible for phenom-
ena involving four photons, like CARS, four wave mixing (FWM), third harmonic generation
(THG), and nonlinear refraction.

In this section we focus on CARS, a spectroscopic technique that has recently received in-
creasing attention for its applications for vibrational imaging [9]. In CARS spectroscopy, the
frequencies of two incident lasers, w p and w s (Pump and Stokes, respectively), are selected
such that the difference in frequency w p-w s= w v is equal to the frequency of a Raman-active
vibrational mode present in the molecule under study [10]. As evidenced from Eq.1, CARS is
a nonlinear, four-wave mixing process. It follows the CARS ﬁeld is a result of the interaction
between four photons and is generated in the phase-matching direction at the anti-Stokes fre-
quency w AS = 2w p
w s, implying that the CARS signal intensity is linearly dependent on the
Stokes ﬁeld intensity and quadratically dependent on the pump ﬁeld intensity. Note that CARS
is a coherent process, with the phase of the anti-Stokes ﬁeld related to the phase of the excita-
tion ﬁeld. Therefore, constructive interference of the anti-Stokes ﬁeld causes the CARS signal
to be signiﬁcantly larger than the spontaneous Raman signal, given the same average excitation
power [11]. All these characteristics have allowed CARS to be successfully employed to pro-
vide vibrational contrast in scanning microscopy [9, 11, 12, 13]. CARS microscopy generally
involves scanning overlapped and tightly focused pump and Stokes lasers through a sample
while measuring the anti-Stokes signal amplitude point by point [14]. The ﬁrst CARS micro-
scope [12] used non-collinear pump and Stokes visible lasers to prove microscopic imaging of
the spatial distribution of deuterated molecular bonds in a sample of onion skin.

Picosecond lasers were used by Hashimoto et al.[14] to improve the Raman spectral res-
olution and to further reduce the non-resonant background signal. Cheng et al.[11] theoreti-
cally evaluated the use of CARS in microscopy and recently used polarization, epi-directional,
counter propagating, and forward CARS microscopy to study cell biology. Multiplex CARS
imaging has also been demonstrated to provide contrast based on one or more vibrational spec-
tral features [13].

In each of these CARS microscopy techniques, the anti-Stokes photons are counted in order
to estimate the density of the Raman scatterers in the focal volume of the microscope. Unfortu-
nately, the spectral phase information is lost in this process. In this paper we present a new in-
terferometric technique called Nonlinear Interferometric Vibrational Imaging (NIVI) [15] with
the capability for heterodyne detection and the possibility to obtain a full reconstruction of the
magnitude and phase of the sample Raman susceptibility [16, 17].

2.2. Experimental Setup

The laser system constructed to create the laser ﬁelds necessary to stimulate the CARS signal in
the samples is shown in Fig.2. A diode pumped frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 laser (Coherent,
Verdi) was used to pump a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator (KMLabs) operating at a center
wavelength of 807 nm, with a bandwidth of 30 nm, a repetition rate of 82 MHz, and an average
power of 300 mW. These pulses were sent to seed a regenerative chirped pulse ampliﬁer (Co-
herent, RegA 9000) that produced approximately 70 fs, 5 m J pulses with a repetition rate of 250
kHz and an average power of 1.25 W. Around ten percent of this average power was used as the
pump beam; the remaining power was directed to an optical parametric ampliﬁer (Coherent,
OPA 9400) which generated a 4 mW average power Stokes beam, tunable from 400-1200 nm
[17].

Once the pump and the Stokes ﬁelds were generated, the two ﬁelds entered the interferometer
shown in detail in Fig.3. An excitation ﬁeld consisting of two overlapped pulses centered at the
pump and Stokes wavelengths was divided by a beamsplitter into two separate interferometer
paths, which are referred to in Fig.3 as “sample arm” and “reference arm”.

A sample of a molecule was placed into each arm into which the split excitation ﬁelds were
focused. When the Stokes pulses were tuned such that the difference in frequency between the
pump and Stokes pulses was equal to a Raman active vibrational mode present in the molecule
in both the sample arm and the reference arm, an anti-Stokes signal was generated in each arm

of the interferometer. It will follow that the anti-Stokes ﬁelds, being coherent with the incident
ﬁelds, will interfere at the beamsplitter BS2 when temporally and spatially overlapped.

The pump and Stokes pulses, at 807 and 1072 nm respectively, were used to excite the
1. The pulses were collinearly over-
Raman-active vibrational mode of benzene at 3063 cm−
lapped using a dichroic mirror and split with a 50:50 ultrafast beamsplitter (BS1) into the sam-
ple arm and the reference arm. The positions of the samples in the sample and reference arms
were chosen such that the distances of the samples from the beamsplitter BS1 were equal. The
two generated anti-Stokes pulses were then overlapped in time by adjusting the relative de-
lay (delay line) and in space by adjusting the position on a second beamsplitter (BS2). The
anti-Stokes signal was spectrally and spatially ﬁltered. The delay line in the reference arm was
scanned by a computer-controlled single axis translation stage at a constant rate. The CARS
signal intensity was measured with a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The signal was ﬁltered with
a low-pass anti-aliasing ﬁlter and sampled with a PC based data acquisition system (NI DAQ,
National Instruments).

2.3. Results and discussion
Initially the interferometer was calibrated with the pump signal only (l = 807 nm). The ac-
quired interferogram (Fig.4) is shown for reference as a comparison with the following inter-
ferograms shown below. The interferogram was detected at the beamsplitter BS2 (Fig.3) and
was recorded as the pathlength of the reference arm was scanned. Having determined the in-

ship between the anti-Stokes and the Stokes intensities, and the quadratic relationship between
the anti-Stokes and the pump intensities. This implies that our signal is a result of a four-wave
mixing process. In addition, we observed that this process is CARS resonance because the
anti-Stokes power is maximized when the Stokes wavelength is tuned to resonance with the
Raman-active benzene vibrational mode.

Established that the ﬁltered signals from both the cuvettes were CARS signals, we detected
the resulting signal at the beamsplitter BS2 of the setup shown in Fig.3. The measured interfero-
gram results from the interference between the two anti-Stokes signals and was recorded as the
pathlength of the reference arm was scanned. The function used to ﬁt the experimental data is

The possibility to demodulate interferometrically the two anti-Stokes signals generated in
separate samples demonstrates the potential of CARS as a promising technique for providing
molecular contrast for OCT-like interferometric imaging systems. Interference indicates that
similar Raman-active vibrational frequencies were present in both the reference and the sample
arm. The “ﬁngerprint” nature of Raman spectroscopy and the possibility to switch between
different molecular species in the reference arm, could permit selective detection and imaging
of different molecules in the sample.

Moreover, the possibility to interfere a weak CARS signal with another strong CARS signal

(produced in the reference arm), provides heterodyne sensitivity and an improved S/N ratio.

3. SHG contrast enhancement

3.1. Theory

Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), also known as frequency doubling, has recently emerged
as a valid imaging contrast mechanism for microscopic imaging of cell and tissue structures and
functions [18]. As mentioned in Sec. 2.1 SHG, in contrast to CARS, is a c (2) process in which
two photons at the fundamental frequency are converted into a single photon at exactly twice
the frequency without having any absorption and/or re-emission from the sample [19]. Even in
this case the intensity of the incident light is responsible for the induced nonlinear polarization,
with the result that the amplitude of the SHG signal is proportional to the square of the incident
light intensity.

The ﬁrst biological SHG imaging experiment [18] dates back to 1986 and involved the study
of orientation of collagen ﬁbers in rat tail tendon [20]. Since then, SHG microscopy has been
successfully applied in many different ﬁelds. In particular, SHG has proved to be highly effec-
tive in selectively probing interfaces, without being overwhelmed by the signal coming from

the bulk media [21]. The reason for this is that second-order processes are electric dipole for-
bidden in centrosymmetric media. This implies bulk liquids and centrosymmetric crystalline
solids do not generate second-harmonic signals. Instead, at the interfaces, the molecular and
atomic species experience different interactions and the inversion symmetry, which is present
in the bulk, is broken [21]. Another advantage of SHG microscopy is the high resolution typ-
ically achieved in nonlinear microscopy, and its applications for imaging structures in live tis-
sues consisting of endogenous proteins such as collagen. Note that the contrast mechanism is
obtained without requiring the presence of any exogenous labels [22].

For all these reasons, SHG microscopy is a good candidate for providing contrast enhance-
ment for OCT. In the next section we will demonstrate that the interferometer presented in Sec.
2.1 can be analogously used for SHG heterodyne detection due to the fact that SHG, like CARS,
is a process coherent with the excitation ﬁeld.

conﬁguration, instead of having a Stokes and a Pump laser, only the Pump laser at 807 nm was
present. In the reference arm, a reference nonlinear crystal (BBO, Type I) with a thickness of
100 m m was present in which SHG signal was created. In the sample arm, a different nonlinear
crystal (BBO, Type I) with a thickness of 1 mm, was present. The signals generated in both the
crystals were overlapped as in the CARS conﬁguration scheme.

Unique to the general methodology of our technique, when a SHG crystal is placed in the
reference arm, SHG signal created in the sample under investigation and present in the sample
arm can be heterodyne-detected, allowing for high sensitivity detection and OCT imaging.

3.3. Results and discussion

signals. This result indicates that two SHG signals generated in separate samples using the same

pump laser can be demodulated interferometrically. In this case as well, the presence of interfer-
ence clearly demonstrates the potential of SHG and resonance-enhanced SHG as a promising
technique for providing molecular contrast for OCT-like interferometric imaging systems. The
presence of a nonlinear crystal in the reference arm will allow one to interferometrically de-
modulate the SHG signal created in the sample under investigation.

4. Simulations

Simulations of the coherent nonlinear processes were performed to determine the properties
of the signals that could be expected from both the nonlinear interferometric setups (Fig.3, and
Fig.7) utilizing SHG and CARS. Because of the wide bandwidths typically used in OCT signals,
the slowly varying envelope approximation did not sufﬁce for these simulations. Instead, we
utilized a method that approximated a continuous signal by sampling it spatially at regular
intervals. The evolution of the nonlinear signal was achieved by applying the nonlinearity at
each point in space and time, and propagating the signal forward in time in uniform steps.
Because of the low conversion efﬁciency, we assumed that the incident wave would not change
in time except for linear propagation effects, and so would experience no depletion in energy.
The model assumed that the incident and excited waves were one-dimensional plane waves. As
a result, walk-off effects resulting from the divergence of the wave and ray (Poynting) vectors
that occur with a ﬁnite incident beam size in a birefringent medium were not accounted for. For
the simulation of SHG, the nonlinearity was assumed to be instantaneous, but the dispersion of
the BBO crystal was accounted for, so that phase matching effects (at 28 degrees inclination of
the extraordinary axis) were properly simulated. The incoming wave was negatively chirped,
with an 807 nm center frequency and 30 nm bandwidth. Because of the rather thick crystal (1
mm) used in the experiment and present in the sample arm, 5 ps of simulation time was used
to interact the waves. Due to the thickness, phase matching can not be achieved over the entire

incident bandwidth. The results of the simulation are shown in the ﬁrst movie, a clip of which is
shown in Fig.9. The left graph shows the temporal spectrum of the incident beam in green, and
the second harmonic spectrum in black as the pulse evolves in time. The middle graph shows
the spatial envelope of the incident pulse in green and the created second harmonic pulse in
black. Finally, the right graph shows the autocorrelation of the second harmonic pulse at that
time, which corresponds to the interferogram that would be measured from two identical BBO
crystals of a thickness that corresponds to the propagation time of the simulation. The spatial
origin of the simulation moves with the reference frame of the incident pulse.

For the ﬁrst 500 fs, the bandwidth is approximately √2 times that of the incident pulse. As
phase mismatch and group velocity mismatch start to occur, the nonlinear polarization adds
destructively with the second harmonic pulse. The resulting spectrum of the pulse becomes
quite nonuniform. Because the excited signal is simulated as a plane wave, all of the generated
frequency components overlap spatially and contribute to the autocorrelation of the measured
interference signal. Therefore the simulated autocorrelation has many sidelobes correspond-
ing to the nonuniform spectrum. In the experimental setup, a focused beam was used, and so
the walk-off separated the spectral components of the second harmonic pulse spatially. At the
pinhole PH present at the exit of the interferometer (Fig.7), only a limited bandwidth could
be focused through, and so the autocorrelation length was much longer than would have been
expected if phase matching occurred over the entire incident pulse bandwidth. We expect that
with a shorter crystal, phase-matching could be better achieved and the autocorrelation could
achieve its theoretical minimum for the bandwidth available from the incident pulse.

Simulating the CARS process require a different approach because unlike a nonresonant
nonlinear second-harmonic generation process, a resonant process has a “memory” associated
with the nonlinear polarization of the Raman process at each point in the medium. Walk-off did
not occur because the simulated medium, liquid benzene, is isotropic. The incoming radiation
was assumed to be two overlapped pulses of 30 nm bandwidth at 807 and 1072 nm, which

created a beat frequency at a vibrational frequency of the benzene. The vibration was assumed
to be a single vibration of Lorentzian proﬁle with a much longer lifetime than the duration
of the incident pulse. At each time step the nonlinear Raman polarization at each point in
the medium was updated by driving it with the instantaneous intensity of the incident pulse
at that point. Fluctuations in the intensity of the incident ﬁeld at the Raman frequency will
excite the nonlinear polarization at that point in the medium. This nonlinear polarization was
mixed with the incident beam to create the anti-Stokes signal. The second movie, shown in

Fig.10, details the evolution of the simulation of the anti-Stokes pulse in liquid benzene over
1 ps. The upper left graph shows the temporal spectrum of the incident pulse in green, and
the created anti-Stokes spectrum in black. The upper right graph shows the spatial proﬁle of
the magnitude of the incident pulse in green, and the magnitude of the created anti-Stokes
pulse in black. The lower left shows the spatial distribution of the magnitude of the Raman
polarization of the benzene medium. Finally, the lower right shows the autocorrelation of the
anti-Stokes pulse. Initially, as the pulse propagates the medium is not excited, and therefore
no anti-Stokes light can be created. As the pulse moves through a given point in the medium,
the medium is resonantly excited. The medium then mixes with the incoming pulse to generate
an anti-Stokes wave on the trailing edge of the incident pulse, where the maximum Raman
polarization coincides with the incident pulse. Because the anti-Stokes and incident pulses are
close in frequency, and dispersion is low in the near infrared, the anti-Stokes pulse can remain
in phase with the incident pulse for a long distance in the medium and phase matching is easier
to achieve. Because of the lack of walk-off, the simulation predicts well the autocorrelation
observed by experiment.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have described a novel technique for contrast enhancement in OCT based
on optical nonlinearities. The contrast mechanisms are based on resonant enhancement of the
third order and second order nonlinear susceptibility of the molecules under investigation. The
interference between two CARS signals generated in separate samples (or alternatively two
SHG signals), was observed, allowing for heterodyne detection. Numerical simulations for both
coherent nonlinear processes were performed in order to determine the properties of the signal
expected at the exit of the described nonlinear interferometers, and the predicted results are in
agreement with the experimental data. The proposed interferometric scheme is very promising
for the development of a new molecular imaging technique (NIVI) based on nonlinear, low-
coherence interferometry [15, 17] and for SHG-OCT.

In this work, we focused on forward CARS and SHG, but epi-detected CARS and SHG are
coherent as well and are compatible with OCT coherence-ranging systems. CARS and SHG in-
terferometry provide the advantages of interferometric detection and at the same time provide
OCT with molecular-speciﬁc contrast. These advantages could make CARS and SHG inter-
ferometry a powerful tool for biological imaging with OCT. Moreover, the same conﬁguration
scheme could be exploited for Third Harmonic Generation (THG) microscopy [23], Coherent
Stokes Raman Scattering (CSRS) microscopy, and other coherent scattering processes.

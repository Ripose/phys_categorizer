Abstract

Quadrupole radiation of an atom in an arbitrary environment is investigated within classical as

well as quantum electrodynamical approaches. Analytical expressions for decay rates are obtained

in terms of Green’s function of Maxwell equations. The equivalence of both approaches is shown.

General expressions are applied to analyze the quadrupole decay rate of an atom placed between

two half spaces with arbitrary dielectric constant. It is shown that in the case when the atom is

close to the surface, the total decay rate is inversely proportional to the ﬁfth power of distance

between an atom and a plane interface.

INTRODUCTION

In the recent years the goal of science now has been moving from consideration of the

fundamental properties of atoms to controlling and changing these properties.

It is well

known that decay rates of atoms can be changed in cavities [1]. Many investigations, have

been devoted to a description of the cavity QED eﬀects [2]. The main attention was paid

there to the allowed (dipole) transitions. The decay rates of dipole transitions were investi-

gated in the vicinity of spherical, cylinder, cone, spheroid, aperture, and more complicated

nanobodies [3],[4].

However, the inﬂuence of environment on the forbidden (quadrupole) transitions is also

of great interest. First of all, it can help one to study the forbidden transitions. Second,

with the help of the forbidden transitions one can describe the long-living states, which are,

in turn, very important in many applications (quantum computers, quantum information).

Finally, the atoms or molecules with forbidden (quadrupole) transitions can be used as

detectors of ﬁeld inhomogeneites.

The ﬁrst experiment dealing with quadrupole transitions near a plane interface was car-

ried out not along ago. The inﬂuence of interface on the absorption of Cs 62S1/2 −
transition was studied [5],[6],[7]. As for the theoretical works, there were very few analyses

52D5/2

on this topic. In [8],[9], the classical calculations of decay rates of quadrupole transitions

near the plane dielectric interface were performed. The quadrupole transitions near sphere

and cylinder were considered within both the classical and QED approaches, and it was

shown that both approaches gave identical results, as shown in [10],[11] . However, there

was no exact proof of equivalence between the classical and QED pictures.

The aim of this paper is to ﬁnd expressions for the quadrupole decay rates and to prove

their equivalence in an arbitrary environment. In Section II we derive expressions for total

decay rate of a Lorenz oscillator in arbitrary environment through Green function of Maxwell

equations. In Section III we ﬁnd the expressions for total decay rate of an atom in arbitrary

environment within the QED approach, and show that they are the same as those in the

classical approach. Then we apply general results to ﬁnd expressions for quadrupole decay

rates for an atom placed in a planar cavity (Section IV) This problem is very important

for some experiments on reﬂection spectroscopy in thin cells [12]. General expressions for

quadrupole decay rates in planar cavity are investigated for the case of dielectric or metallic

walls in Section V.

II. CLASSICAL DESCRIPTION OF QUADRUPOLE RADIATION IN ANY EN-

It is easy to show within classical electrodynamics that the total rate of work performed

by the ﬁeld can be presented in the form of [13]

d3rJ (r, t)

E (r, t)

·

where J (r, t) and E (r, t) are the density of current and strength of the electric ﬁeld, re-

spectively. This power represents a conversion of electromagnetic ﬁeld into mechanical or

thermal energy. In quasi monochromatic case we have instead of (1) the following expression

where ω is the frequency, and * means the complex conjugation.

Now, after a substitution of (10) into (6) and (7) and a partial integration, the ﬁnal

Thus, to calculate quadrupole decay rates it is suﬃce to determine the respective deriva-

tives of Green function of Helmholtz wave equation. This result was quite expected as we

know that electric quadrupoles interact with ﬁeld gradients.

Comparing expression (31)with the classical expression (15) one can see that they are

identical. It means that both classical and QED models are equivalent for description of

the total decay rate. Comparison of (30) and (14) reveals the diﬀerence by the factor of

4.The same diﬀerence takes place in the case of dipole transitions and is related to diﬀerent

deﬁnitions of dipole and quadrupole momenta in classical and quantum mechanics.

One should also remember that these equations describe the total decay rates. To ﬁnd

the radiative decay rates one should use other approaches, which allow one to take into

account the radiation patterns of photons. It can be done, for example, within the classical

(29)

(30)

(31)

approach.

IV. QUADRUPOLE DECAY RATES OF AN ATOM PLACED IN A PLANAR

To calculate the decay rates of quadrupole transition in an atom placed between two

dielectric half-spaces (Fig.2) one should ﬁnd the electric Green function of Maxwell equation.

It is very important to ensure that this function should satisfy the symmetry condition

and the Lorenz reciprocity relation, which follows from the deﬁnition (23). The approach

suggested in [19] allows one to build such a function. According to [19] the Green function

in layered media can be presented in the following form (z > z′)

As mentioned above, these results describe the total decay rates, i.e.

radiative and

nonradiative. Generally, it is diﬃcult to separate these contributions. However, one can

assume that this separation can be made on the basis of the classical energy ﬂux method.

It should be noted that a purely radiation channel may exist, in this geometry, in an ideal





case of matter without losses. At negligibly small losses, the radiation energy would not go

to inﬁnity. This is the diﬀerence between the geometry under consideration and an open

geometry, at which the radiation might go to inﬁnity throughout a free space.

V. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS

The expressions that had been obtained in the previous section are rather complicated

and their calculation is an independent problem, in a general case. The complexity is due to

the fact that the integrands are the complex functions with a set of the singular points, which

might be both the branching points, and the poles. These peculiarities are connected with

physical properties of the problem. In any case, in the integrand there are the branching

points at k =

√εk0. If the mode wave propagation is formed in a cavity (metallic mirrors)

±

then the poles appear in the integrands. So, in diﬀerent physical situations, the calculations

are to be performed with account of these factors.

A. Atom between perfect metallic mirrors

In the case of the well conducting metallic mirrors, the expressions (38), (43), and (48),

in which the reﬂection coeﬃcients are substituted by their analogs for the case of an ideal

conductivity,

will be good approximations for the rates

Because the ideal conductivity is the limiting case for a real metal, where the poles must

lie above the horizontal axis of integration, the integration circuit of the ideal conductivity

must envelope the poles from below, as shown in Fig.3.

surface. However, in the vicinity of the surface, the nonradiative losses connected with

imaginary part of the dielectric constant are of the main importance. These losses are the

reason of a fast increase in the total losses (see Eqs.(64)-(66)).

In the case of an ideal

conductor, the losses are absent, and there is a diﬀerence between the decay rates of a

hypothetic metal and an ideal conductor.

In the case of real metals, that diﬀerence might be still more profound because the

imaginary part of the permittivity is not negligibly small as compared to the real part.

Figure 5 illustrates the decay rates for a micro-resonator with silver mirrors. From the

Figures one can see that the rate of spontaneous decays in the real resonator diﬀers from

the decay rate in the cavity with ideal walls substantially.

B. Atom between dielectric mirrors

A planar cavity can also be realized on the basis of two opposite dielectric half-spaces. No

propagating waveguiding modes are formed in that case, and the integrand, respectively, has

no poles in a complex plane near a real axis. This should simplify a numerical calculation of

the integrals. Figure 6 demonstrates the dependencies of the quadrupole decay rates on the

atomic position and structure of the quadrupole moment for a planar resonator with silica

walls.

In the case of quite a large-size cavity (micro-cavity, Fig.6) one can observe an increase

in the rate of spontaneous decays as an atom is approaching the wall. In contrast to the

case of metallic mirrors, such an increase is due to the coupling of the non-propagating near

ﬁelds emitted by the quadrupole, with the propagating ﬁelds inside the dielectric (silica).

One can notice the inﬂuence of the intrinsic non-radiative processes at a distance less than

1 nm only, because the imaginary part of the quartz permittivity is very small at optical

frequencies (see Eqs. (64)-(66)). At such distances one should take into account the random

inhomogeneities of the surface structure.

As the distance between dielectric walls is small (nano-cavity, Fig.7), the electric ﬁelds

are near ﬁelds one, at any atom position between the walls, and there occurs the eﬀective

ﬁeld transformation into the wave propagation over a dielectric. This provides a consider-

able acceleration of the transitions. The intrinsic non-radiative decay channel is formed at

distances closer to the wall, and this is unseen on the picture.

14

Note that all the energy of an excited atom will be emitted in the dielectric, and all the

losses will, therefore, be non-radiative. But in the case of the weakly absorbing dielectrics,

including silica, it is not unreasonable to distinguish between the regions of the eﬀective

transformation into the propagating waves and the regions of the intrinsic radiative losses.

C. Atom inside ultra thin cell

Very interesting spectroscopy experiments are carried out now with atoms inside an extra-

thin dielectric cell. Suﬃce it to say that the width of the cell cab be as small as 20 nm [20].

So, it is very interesting to understand the behavior of decay rate in that case.

All dimensional parameters are small in comparison with wavelength. As a result we

can use the quasi-static approximation to calculate decay rates found in a previous section.

The quasistatic approach here is equivalent to the case of k >> k0 = ω/c. In this limit the

Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients can be simpliﬁed substantially

From this asymptotics one can see that the total decay rate increases inversely propor-

tional to the ﬁfth power of distance to surface z = 0. This behavior is diﬀerent substantially

from the dipole case, where decay rates increase inversely proportional to the third power

of distance to surface. Another interesting point one can get from (64) - (66) , is that the

zz-quadrupoles suﬀer a six-fold enhancement in comparison with other components.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, the processes of the spontaneous quadrupole atomic radiation in an ar-

bitrary environment were considered within the framework of both classical and quantum

electrodynamics. The general equations derived for the rates of quadrupole transitions were

expressed through the spatial derivatives of the retarded Green function corresponding to

the classical problem of electrodynamics.

It was shown that the expressions diﬀer by a

numerical coeﬃcient 4 only, which is connected with the deﬁnition of quadrupole moments

which have diﬀerent physical sense in the classical and quantum mechanics. The expressions

for the relative decay rates, i.e. the rates normalized by the uniform space rate, prove to be

identical.

The results obtained are applied to a description of quadrupole atomic transitions in a

planar cavity. The explicit analytical expressions for the rates of any quadrupole transition

were found for such a cavity. The results have been analyzed in detail for the planar

cavities with dielectric and metallic walls. It was found that the quadrupole transitions are

accelerated with decreasing resonator size. In the case of dielectric walls, such an acceleration

is due to the transformation of the near dipole ﬁelds into the propagating waves inside the

dielectric. In the case of metallic mirrors, the acceleration becomes more profound, and is

due to the radiation absorption at the surface layer of a metal.

In this paper we restrict ourselves to investigation of quadrupole decay rates. However,

our approach can be also applied to description of frequency shifts of quadrupole transi-

tions in nanoenviroment. Again, general expressions for frequency shift will be expressed

16

through space derivatives of retarded Green function. We will present detailed investigation

of frequency shifts of quadrupole transitions in nanoenviroment in a separate publication.

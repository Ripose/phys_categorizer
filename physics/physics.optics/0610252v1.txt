Abstract

The possibility of soliton self-compression of ultrashort laser pulses down to the few-cycle regime

in photonic crystal ﬁbers is numerically investigated. We show that eﬃcient sub-two-cycle temporal

compression of nanojoule-level 800 nm pulses can be achieved by employing short (typically 5-mm-

long) commercially available photonic crystal ﬁbers and pulse durations of around 100 fs, regardless

of initial linear chirp, and without the need of additional dispersion compensation techniques. We

envisage applications in a new generation of compact and eﬃcient sub-two cycle laser pulse sources.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last twenty years, much eﬀort has been done in generating ultrafast laser pulses

in the few-cycle regime. These pulses are behind numerous and important achievements in

such diverse ﬁelds as the study of ultrafast dynamics in matter, extreme nonlinear optics,

high-order harmonic generation, and attosecond physics [1, 2].

Low-energy (nanojoule) sub-2-cycle pulses have been directly produced by state-of-the-art

Ti:sapphire laser oscillators [3, 4] where the required ultrabroad bandwidths were achieved

by means of double-chirped mirrors that provide high reﬂectivity bandwidth and tailored dis-

persion compensation over an extended spectral range. Higher energy pulses (from hundreds

of nanojoules up to hundreds of microjoules) have also been produced by passive and/or

active phase control of broadband laser sources and of supercontinua generated in Kerr me-

dia. These include ultra-broadband optical parametric ampliﬁers [5], spectrally broadened

cavity-dumped oscillators [6], and gas-ﬁlled hollow ﬁbers pumped by kHz ampliﬁers [7, 8]

where active compression of the generated broadband spectra has resulted in the shortest

(3.4 fs) light pulses to date [9, 10].

However, in all of the above techniques, the possibility of reaching the few-cycle regime

relies on sophisticated intracavity or extracavity dispersion compensation schemes, with the

latter usually requiring complex electronically-controlled feedback systems.

A diﬀerent approach to pulse compression relies on the concept of soliton-eﬀect compres-

sion of laser pulses, which dates back to the 1980s [11] and has been used to successfully

compress low-energy picosecond pulses to durations as short as 18 fs [12] without the need

of additional dispersion compensation. This method exploits the peculiarities of high-order

periodical soliton propagation in optical ﬁbers in the anomalous dispersion regime, where

eﬃcient compression is obtained at the output end of a ﬁber of properly chosen length. A sig-

nature of this process is the appearance of a broad pedestal, which for relatively long pulses

(> 100 fs) can be eﬃciently suppressed by taking advantage of the birefringence induced by

the intense main pulse in the ﬁber itself [13, 14].

Until recently, all theoretical and experimental studies of soliton compression were focused

on normal single-mode ﬁbers [11], which exhibit anomalous dispersion only for wavelengths

larger than 1 µm, as well as a relatively low nonlinearity. The introduction of highly nonlinear

photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs) [15] and photonics nanowires having anomalous dispersion

2

at visible and near infrared wavelengths has shed a new light on this ﬁeld, in particular in

view of the possibility of applying soliton compression techniques to the pulses emitted by

today’s most common ultrafast lasers, such as Ti:sapphire and Cr:LISAF oscillators.

Speciﬁcally, the broad region of anomalous group delay dispersion (which for photonic

nanowires extends into the visible spectral region) allows for the eﬃcient compression of

pulses in the 800 nm region, as recently demonstrated by Foster et al. [16], who experimen-

tally achieved pulse compression of low-energy pulses from 70 fs down to 6.8 fs in photonic

nanowires, and theoretically predicted pulses as short as one single optical cycle. Even if

photonic nanowires can exhibit ﬂatter dispersion proﬁles in the visible and near-infrared

regions than most PCFs, their use still poses diﬃculties, mostly due to their small dimen-

sions, delicate construction, and implementation. On the other hand, PCFs with core sizes

of around 1.5 µm and a high nonlinearity are readily available. In a recent work, Bessonov et

al. [17] theoretically investigated solitonic propagation and compression of high-energy laser

pulses in hollow photonic crystal ﬁbers, where pulse durations down to 10 fs at wavelengths

of around 1 µm were predicted. However, to our knowledge, soliton self-compression of low-

energy 800 nm ultrashort pulses in highly nonlinear PCFs and in the few-cycle regime has

not been studied so far.

In this work we investigate the possibility of eﬃcient self-compression of low-energy laser

pulses down to the few-cycle regime using a commercially available highly-nonlinear PCF.

We perform a systematic numerical study, based on a generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger

equation that includes higher-order dispersion terms, delayed Raman response and self-

steepening, to identify the most relevant parameters that determine the compression limit.

A detailed comparison between diﬀerent approximations to nonlinear pulse propagation

is made, in order to better isolate the detrimental eﬀects that more strongly aﬀect the

compression process, which shows that pulses with durations a short as 4 fs can be directly

obtained by propagating linearly chirped or transform limited low-energy pulses generated

from a typical (30 − 100 fs) ultrafast Ti:sapphire oscillator in a PCF without the need of

additional compression methods, which may result in novel and compact devices for the

generation of laser pulses in the few-cycle regime.

We believe that this study will be very helpful for predicting the output of actual exper-

iments based on this technique.

II. MODEL DESCRIPTION

In our model, an ultrafast laser pulse as directly generated from a typical (30 − 100 fs)

commercially available Ti:sapphire laser oscillator is coupled to a highly-nonlinear PCF of

length L. The propagation equation along the longitudinal ﬁber direction z for an electric

ﬁeld envelope A(z, t) of central frequency ω0 and in the plane wave approximation is given

by:

β(ω) ˜A(z, ω)e−iωtdω

where ˜A(z, ω) is the spectral ﬁeld amplitude,

where fR is the fractional contribution of the delayed Raman response function hR(t), which

can be expressed as:

R(t) = (1 − fR)δ(t) + fRhR(t),

hR(t) =

exp(−t/τ2) sin(t/τ1),

1 + τ 2

where τ1 and τ2 are two adjustable parameters. Numerical values of fR = 0.18, τ1 = 12.2 fs

and τ2 = 32 fs are chosen to provide a good ﬁt to the measured Raman gain spectrum

of fused silica [11]. The Generalized Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation (GNSE) (1) includes

both self-steepening and the delayed Raman eﬀect [11] and accurately describes pulse prop-

agation of few nJ pulses in PCFs down to the single single cycle regime in the frame-

work of the Slowly Evolving Wave Approximation (SEWA), which requires that the en-

velope and its phase do not vary signif icantly as the pulse covers a distance equal

to its central wavelength λ0 = 2πc/ω0 [18].

In the hypothesis of negligible third-order

dispersion (β(ω) ≃ 1/2β2(ω0)(ω − ω0)2), self-steepening, and delayed Raman response
(B ≃ γA(z, t)|A(z, t)|2), equation (1) reduces to the Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation (NSE),

suitable for describing pulse propagation in the picosecond or even sub-picosecond tempo-

ral regime [11], provided that third- and higher-order dispersion terms can be neglected

and pulse duration is signiﬁcantly longer that the delayed Raman response of the medium,

tR(t)dt ≈ 5 fs (for fused silica). The ﬁber parameters are those of a commercial

highly-nonlinear PCF (BlazePhotonics NL-1.6-670) already available in our laboratory and
which we plan to use in a forthcoming experiment: L = 5 mm, γ = 139 W−1 mm−1, and a

group velocity dispersion (β2) proﬁle as shown in ﬁgure 1.

III. SOLITON-EFFECT COMPRESSION

Soliton-eﬀect compression relies on propagation properties of optical solitons which are

generated in nonlinear ﬁbers in the anomalous dispersion regime [11]. In particular, solitons

of order N ≥ 2 always change their shape periodically as they propagate inside the ﬁber

and in general experience an initial pulse narrowing phase, which can be exploited to obtain

pulse compression once a proper ﬁber length is chosen [11]. The optimal ﬁber length zopt and

the compression factor Fc can be estimated from the following empirical relations obtained

in the framework of the NSE [11]:

Fc ≃ 4.1 N
0.32
N

zopt ≃ (

+

1.1
N 2 )z0,

(6)

(7)

where N =
LN L = (γP0)−1 is the nonlinear length, z0 = π

q

LD/LN L is the soliton order, LD ≃ 0.321 × T 2

2 LD is the soliton period, Tin is the pulse initial

in/β2 is the dispersion length,

full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) duration, and P0 is the peak power of the initial pulse.

In general, the compressed pulses exhibit a broad pedestal whose origin is due to the fact

that the nonlinearity induces a linear chirp only over the central part of the pulse, which

is the only part that can be eﬃciently compressed by the ﬁber anomalous group velocity

dispersion [11]. The quality factor Qc, deﬁned as the fraction of the total energy contained in

the compressed pulse, is always less than unity and scales as the inverse of the compression

factor Fc [11]. Equations (7) predict an indeﬁnitely increasing compression factor for an

initial ﬁxed pulse temporal proﬁle with increasing peak power, once a proper ﬁber length is

5

chosen. However, equations (7) are obtained by integrating the NSE, which fails to be valid

in the few femtosecond temporal regime, so the GNSE has to be used instead.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The best conditions for soliton pulse compression were obtained starting from a 30 fs

initial Fourier transform-limited (TL) gaussian pulse with central wavelenght λ0 = 800 nm,

which can be generated from the ultrafast Ti:sapphire laser oscillator we intend to use

in our future experiment [19, 20]. Our numerical study shows that a typical 30 fs few-nJ

femtosecond pulse requires an optimum ﬁber length considerably shorter than 5 mm, which

immediately poses a practical problem as it is very diﬃcult to obtain such short ﬁber lengths.

However, this length can be increased if the initial pulse duration is made larger for the

same pulse energy and we found that initial pulse durations of around 100 fs readily allow

to overcome this diﬃculty. Therefore, we chose to introduce a positive linear dispersive

material to temporally broaden the initial 30 fs pulse so as to produce the optimal pulse

peak intensity and temporal width at the ﬁber input (see ﬁgure 2). We also found that

this method resulted in the same compressed pulse as if the spectral width (hence temporal

duration) of the initial TL pulse was varied instead. The former method was nevertheless

preferred to the latter, as in principle it permits arbitrarily large extra-cavity pulse stretching

while retaining the initial pulse spectrum generated from the laser oscillator, hence avoiding

disturbances to the laser parameters and mode-locking stability.

Figure 3 shows the spectrum, the spectral phase and the temporal proﬁle of the pulse (a)

at the ﬁber input, and for ﬁber lengths of (b) z = 4 mm, (c) z = 5 mm, and (d) z = 6 mm,
assuming an initial pulse energy E = 5 × 10−10 J and a pulse duration broadened to 119 fs in

a normal positively dispersive medium such as a piece of glass, so as to obtain an optimized

compressed pulse for L = 5 mm under the condition that the most intense pre/post-pulse

has an intensity lower than 0.3 times the pulse peak value.

It can be observed that the

compression process mostly acts upon the central part of the pulse temporal proﬁle, while

maintaining a broad uncompressed pedestal, until a pulse FHWM duration Tf = 3.7 fs and

a quality factor Qc = 0.32 are reached. The central wavelength of the resulting broadened

spectrum does not deviate signiﬁcantly from 800 nm, and so the compressed pulse is less

than two cycles in duration. For z > 5 mm (see ﬁgure 3 (d) and (e)) the pulse temporal

6

proﬁle presents an increasing multi-peak and broadened structure. The asymmetric spectral

proﬁle, larger in the blue side, and the steeper temporal trailing edge shown in ﬁgure 3 (c)

are those typical of self-steepening, while Raman scattering is characterized by a shift of

the pulse spectrum towards lower frequencies, which is associated with a temporal delay of

the pulse [11]. In ﬁgure 4 the spatial evolution of the temporal pulse width, the quality fac-

tor and the relative intensity of the largest secondary pre/post pulse are reported, showing

how the pulse compression process is always associated with a reduction in pulse quality.

The behavior shown in ﬁgures 3 and 4 diﬀers from the soliton pulse evolution predicted by

the NSE as the higher-order dispersion and nonlinear eﬀects included in the GNSE destroy

the periodical evolution typical of high-order solitons. A systematical numerical study was

performed to identify which processes have the most detrimental eﬀect in the pulse com-

pression process. Figures 5 (a) and(b) show the ﬁnal temporal width and the quality factor

as a function of the pulse energy, obtained by integrating the GNSE (curves (1)), neglecting

higher-order dispersion (curves (2)), neglecting self-steepening and delayed Raman response

(curves (3)), and integrating the NSE (curves (4)). The reported values correspond to the

narrowest obtainable pulse with a pre/post pulse relative intensity lower than 0.3. It can

be noticed that higher-order dispersion terms have the most detrimental eﬀect in the com-

pressed pulses, making curves (1) and (2) in ﬁgure 4 (a) go through a minimum value and

therefore deviating from the monotone behavior predicted by relations (7) and conﬁrmed by

curves (3) and (4). In this view the way of increasing the pulse compression eﬀect mostly

relies on using a nonlinear ﬁber with the ﬂattest possible group velocity dispersion. These

results are reminiscient of those obtained for longer pulse durations in the 100 fs range [21].

In the ideal hypothesis of a completely ﬂat group velocity dispersion proﬁle, for the same

pulse energy and temporal width of ﬁgure 3, a compressed single-cycle pulse with Tf = 2.5 fs

and Qc = 0.34 can be obtained (see ﬁgure 6). The need of additional dispersive polarization

elements that introduce signiﬁcant pulse broadening prevents the direct application of stan-

dard nonlinear birrefringe methods to suppress the observed broad pedestal found in soliton

compressed pulses. The pedestal could nevertheless be partially suppressed by simply fo-

cusing the pulses in a thin (100 − 300µm), low-dispersion near infrared low-bandpass ﬁlter,

which can act as an eﬃcient saturable absorber for femtosecond pulses [22].

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we numerically demonstrate the feasibility of eﬃcient soliton compression

of transform-limited or linearly chirped ultrashort laser pulses down to the sub-2-cycle regime

using a standard Ti:sapphire oscillator and a 5-mm long commercially available PCF. An

optimized 3.7 fs pulse can be obtained from an initial ultrashort laser pulse centered at

800 nm, with duration in the 100−fs range and an energy of 0.5 nJ, while longer pulses

can also be compressed at slightly higher pulse energies of a few nJ. We identify high-

order dispersion as the most relevant detrimental factor in few-cycle soliton compression,

showing that single-cycle pulses with 2.5 fs can be obtained for the ideal case of a PCF with

a completely ﬂat dispersion proﬁle. We believe that this technique could be the basis for

novel, compact and eﬃcient sources of few-cycle laser pulses based on a standard ultrafast

oscillator coupled to a properly chosen PCF and a simple pulse cleaner, which could have a

great impact in the scientiﬁc community.

FIG. 5: (Color online) (a) Minimum ﬁnal temporal width and (b) quality factor as a function of

the initial pulse energy obtained by integrating the GNSE (curves (1)), neglecting higher-order

dispersion (curves (2)), neglecting self-steepening and delayed Raman response(curves (3)), and

integrating the NSE (curves (4)). The reported values correspond to the narrowest obtainable

pulse with a pre/post pulse intensity lower than 0.3 times the pulse peak value.

FIG. 6: Single-cycle pulse obtained for the same initial pulse of ﬁgures 3 and 4, in the hypothesis

of a completely ﬂat dispersion proﬁle, i.e. β(ω) ≃ 1/2β2(ω0)(ω − ω0)2.

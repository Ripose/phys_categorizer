We report on a scheme to improve the pointing stability of the ﬁrst order beam diﬀracted by an
acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Due to thermal eﬀects inside the crystal, the angular position of
the beam can change by as much as 1 mrad when the radio-frequency power in the AOM is reduced
to decrease the ﬁrst order beam intensity. This is done for example to perform forced evaporative
cooling in ultracold atom experiments using far-oﬀ-resonant optical traps. We solve this problem
by driving the AOM with two radio-frequencies f1 and f2. The power of f2 is adjusted relative to
the power of f1 to keep the total power constant. Using this, the beam displacement is decreased
by a factor of twenty. The method is simple to implement in existing experimental setups, without
any modiﬁcation of the optics.

INTRODUCTION

CCD amera

An important application of acousto-optic modulators
(AOMs) is the control of laser beam intensities. The
power of the sound wave traveling inside the acousto-
optic crystal determines the amount of light that is
diﬀracted out of an incoming laser beam. However, ther-
mal eﬀects lead to a displacement of the diﬀracted beams
when the power of the radio-frequency driving the AOM
is changed. The position stability is a critical parameter
in many applications using AOMs, especially for dipole
traps formed by strongly focused, far oﬀ-resonant laser
beams [1]. Such traps are playing a major role in atomic
physics nowadays, as they allow for the realization of
new experiments, for example the Bose-Einstein conden-
sation (BEC) of atomic species that cannot be condensed
in magnetic traps such as cesium or chromium [2], or
the all-optical generation of a BEC [3]. Particularly in
crossed optical dipole traps, where two beams have to
be overlapped on a 10 µm scale, a small change of the
beam position can have a dramatic eﬀect on the trap
characteristics (frequency and depth), thus causing se-
vere problems [4]. One way to circumvent them, is to
use a single-mode optical ﬁbre after the AOM, but this
cannot be done for high power lasers, such as CO2 or yt-
terbium ﬁbre lasers. In this paper we report on a simple
scheme, adaptable to any AOM, which strongly reduces
the beam displacement. The method is based on driv-
ing the AOM with two diﬀerent radio-frequencies f1 and
f2, and adjusting their relative powers P1 and P2 so that
the total RF power P = P1 + P2 in the AOM is kept
constant [5]. This article is organized as follows: After
describing the experimental setup with which we measure
the beam displacement, we present our measurements for
AOMs in the 1 µm and the 10 µm wavelength range. In
an appendix we show the details of the electronic circuit
we use to adjust P2 relative to P1 with a single control
voltage.

laser beam is reduced with a telescope before it enters the
AOM. A beam block after the AOM stops all light except the
used beam, which is attenuated and monitored with a CCD
camera. The distance between the AOM and the camera is
1.4 m.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We test the two-frequency method with two AOM
models that use diﬀerent acousto-optic crystals to mod-
ulate the light. The setup for measuring the beam dis-
placement of the ﬁrst AOM using a tellurium dioxide
(TeO2) crystal (Crystal Technology 3110-199) is shown
in ﬁgure 1. We use an ytterbium ﬁber laser (IPG, model
YLR-20-1064-LP-SF) at 1064 nm, with 10 W output
power. The 1/e2 beam radius is reduced with a telescope
from initially 2.1 mm to 0.7 mm before going through the
AOM. After the AOM a beam block stops all light except
the used beam, which is attenuated and monitored with a
CCD camera. We ﬁt the images with a 2D-gaussian and
record the peak position of the beam proﬁle. The setup
for the second AOM using a germanium (Ge) crystal (In-
traAction Corp. AGM-406B1) is slightly diﬀerent. We
use a CO2 laser (Coherent GEM100L) at 10.6 µm, with
21 W of power going through the AOM. At a distance of
about 3 m we measure the beam proﬁle in one dimension
with a movable pinhole in front of a power meter. We ﬁt
the proﬁle with a gaussian and record the peak position.

use for the two-frequency method. To control laser in-

FIG. 2:
(Color online) (a) Normal setup for driving an
AOM with variable RF power. A voltage controlled oscillator
(VCO) generates the radio-frequency f1 (blue line), which is
attenuated to a value given by the control voltage Uin. The
signal is then ampliﬁed before going to the AOM. (b) For the
two-frequency AOM driver we add an extra VCO and attenu-
ator. The additional VCO generates the second RF signal f2
(red line), whose power is adjusted relative to f1 to keep the
total power in the AOM constant. This adjustment is done
by modifying the control voltage Uin with an electronic cir-
cuit (shown in detail in the appendix). For the TeO2 AOM we
use the following Mini-Circuits components: VCO POS-150,
attenuator PAS-3, combiner ZMSC-2-1, ampliﬁer ZHL-1-2W.

tensities with an AOM, one has to change the RF power
driving it. This can be done by attenuating a RF signal
coming from a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) before
amplifying it to its ﬁnal value (ﬁgure 2 (a)). The amount
of light that is diﬀracted out of the incoming beam is
then determined by the control voltage Uin. For the two-
frequency driver we add a second VCO and attenuator
(ﬁgure 2 (b)) with frequency f2. The two frequencies f1
and f2 are chosen close enough in order to be well within
the bandwidth of the AOM [6], but far enough to give
a suﬃcient separation of the two ﬁrst order beams. We
use f1 = 99 MHz (resp. 30 MHz) and f2 = 123 MHz
(resp. 50 MHz) for the TeO2 (resp. Ge) AOM. The
power of the frequency f2 generated by the second VCO
is adjusted relative to the power of f1 in order to keep
the total power in the AOM constant. To do this with
a single control voltage, Uin is modiﬁed by an electronic
circuit (see appendix) before it is applied to the second
attenuator. We adjust the transfer function Uout(Uin) of
the circuit to have a constant total RF power after the
signals are added and ampliﬁed, the latter condition be-
ing crucial to take into account the ampliﬁer saturation.
Laser light going through an AOM driven by two fre-
quencies is diﬀracted in many diﬀerent beams as can be
seen in ﬁgure 3. The image was taken with the TeO2
AOM at about equal power of both RF signals. Besides
the zeroth order beam, the ﬁrst order of both frequen-
cies, as well as second and even third order beams, which
correspond to multiple absorption and stimulated emis-
sion of phonons [7], can be seen. For measuring the beam

frequencies. The image shows a picture of the laser beam

age the frequency shifts corresponding to the diﬀracted light
are indicated (f1 = 99 MHz, f2 = 123 MHz).

displacement we optimize the angle between the acoustic
wave and the incident laser beam to have the maximum
power in the ﬁrst order of f1. With full power at this fre-
quency and none at f2, we achieve diﬀraction eﬃciencies
up to 90%.

III. MEASUREMENTS

With the setups described above we measure the po-
sition of the ﬁrst order beam of f1 at diﬀerent RF pow-
ers for the two AOMs, with and without the second fre-
quency.
In ﬁgure 4 we plot the angular movement as
a function of the laser power in the ﬁrst order beam.
Figure 4 (a) shows the displacement perpendicular to
the plane of diﬀraction y for the TeO2 AOM. The dis-
placement in the plane of diﬀraction x (not shown in
the ﬁgure) has the same dependence as perpendicular to
it, but is smaller by a factor of three. Adding the sec-
ond frequency keeps the beam position almost constant
(below 0.03 mrad), whereas without, a beam displace-
ment of up to 0.6 mrad occurs. A big improvement is
also evident for the Ge AOM (ﬁgure 4 (b)), the angular
movement is reduced by a factor of ten. The fact that
we are not able to compensate the displacement as well
as with the TeO2 AOM is due to the higher RF power
the AOM is driven with. For maximum diﬀraction eﬃ-
ciency the Ge AOM needs 30 W RF power, whereas the
TeO2 AOM needs only 2 W. Another TeO2 AOM that we
tested (A-A Opto-Electronics deﬂector, model MTS80-
A3-1064Ac) uses a sheer mode acoustic wave and needs
only 0.5 W RF power for maximum diﬀraction eﬃciency.
Its beam movement is signiﬁcantly smaller than for the
other AOMs, only up to 0.1 mrad, but still larger than
with the two-frequency method [8].

To supplement those steady state measurements, we
have also checked for the TeO2 crystal that the suppres-
sion of the beam movement remains good, when the RF
power is dynamically ramped down over a timescale of a
few seconds, as is done for forced evaporative cooling of
ultracold atoms.

ﬁrst second.

The two-frequency method helps also to stabilize the
laser power P in the ﬁrst order when switching the RF
power rapidly as can be seen in ﬁgure 5, which shows the
time dependence of P (t) for the TeO2 AOM. Without
the second frequency it takes about 10 seconds until the
steady state value is reached, when switching the laser
power abruptly from 10 to 100%. The beam displacement
takes place over the same time scale. Only a very small
transient eﬀect in the ﬁrst second after switching can be
seen, when using the two-frequency method.

In conclusion we have demonstrated a simple method
to improve the pointing stability of a beam diﬀracted by
an AOM when the intensity is ramped down. The salient
advantage of this technique lies in the fact that only the
RF driver has to be modiﬁed, without any modiﬁcations
of the optics.

APPENDIX: VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT CIRCUIT

In this appendix we present a simple way to realize the
voltage adjustment needed for the two-frequency method
(ﬁgure 2 (b)). The electronic circuit shown in ﬁgure 6 (a)
modiﬁes the control voltage Uin, so that the total RF
power stays constant in the AOM. We measured the re-
quired calibration curve Uout as a function of Uin, which
the circuit approximates by a stepwise linear function. To
do this, we use an inverting ampliﬁer whose gain at low
voltages is given by − R11+R12
R1+R2 . Parallel to R1 and R2 are
other resistors (R3, R4, ...) in series with Zener diodes. If
Uin is larger than the Zener voltage of one of the diodes
it gets conducting and the gain is increased. For ex-
ample if 4.3 V 6 Uin 6 6.3 V the gain is increased to
−
(R1+R2)k(R3+R4) . Thus, each time Uin exceeds a Zener
voltage of one of the diodes the gain increases. The am-
pliﬁed voltage U ′ is then inverted to U ′′ before in the
last step the voltage Uoﬀ is added. The potentiometer
R16 allows for an extra gain in the last step. We use
large potentiometers for all resistors to have a big ﬂexi-
bility for the transfer function. In ﬁgure 6 (b) the mea-
sured transfer function is plotted. With this we are able
to keep the total RF power after ampliﬁcation constant
within 10%, which is enough to strongly reduce the beam
displacement. For the setup using the Ge AOM we use
a more complex control box, which digitizes Uin with an
analog-to-digital converter and then generates the out-

[8] One drawback of the acousto-optic deﬂector is that the
sound velocity for the sheer mode in TeO2 is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller (by a factor of ﬁve) than for the longitu-
dinal mode, leading to longer rise times. Using the two-
frequency method with a longitudinal mode AOM allows
one to keep fast rise times.

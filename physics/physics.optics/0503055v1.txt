(Dated: October 30, 2013)

We demonstrate that signiﬁcant eﬀects in the ”superluminal propagation” of light-pulses cannot be
observed without involving systems whose gain explodes outside the pulse spectrum. We explicitly
determine the minimum norm of the gain to attain given superluminal eﬀects and the transfer
function of the corresponding optimal system. The gain-norms which would be required with the
most eﬃcient systems considered up to now (dispersive media, photonic barriers) to attain the same
eﬀects are shown to exceed the minimum by several orders of magnitude. We ﬁnally estimate the
largest superluminal advances which could be attained in a realistic experiment.

PACS numbers: 42.25.Bs, 02.60.Gf, 03.65.Xp

The apparently superluminal propagation of

light-
pulses has been observed with various systems, mainly
with systems involving anomalously dispersive media or
photonic barriers. For reviews, see, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
In these experiments, the envelope of the pulse having
covered some distance L is nearly identical to that of the
incident pulse and in advance of that of a pulse which has
covered the same distance L at the velocity c of light in
vacuum. This surprising behaviour is not at odds with
the relativistic causality.
Indeed the signal received at
some time t is not the consequence of the signal emitted
at a well-deﬁned time but of all the signals anterior to
t by more than L/c. Otherwise said, there is no cause-
to-eﬀect relation between the homologous points of the
envelopes of the incident and transmitted pulses and the
widespread statement that the pulse maximum leaves the
system before it even enters it is somewhat misleading.
The phenomenon is however quite puzzling and keeps the
subject of an intense theoretical and experimental activ-
ity.

In fact Mother Nature resists to a violation of her
principles even when this violation is only apparent and
convincing experiments of superluminal transmission are
very diﬃcult to achieve. By convincing experiments, we
mean experiments where (i) the envelopes or the intensity
proﬁles of the pulses are detected in real-time and true-
shape (ii) the transmitted pulse is directly compared to
the pulse having propagated at the velocity c (iii) the
superluminal advance a is large compared to the opti-
cal period (iv) it is signiﬁcant with respect to the pulse
duration, say larger than 10% of the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the intensity proﬁle τp (v) the
pulse distortion (including noise and parasitic signals)
is small compared to the relative advance a/τp. Note
that (iii) is a consequence of (i) since the real-time de-
tection of the envelope requires a time-constant large
compared to the optical period. There are few exper-
iments meeting, even approximately, the previous con-
ditions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Though all-optical

experiments are possible, only hybrid systems have been
used up to now. They combine an optical part, respon-
sible for the superluminal eﬀects, and a wide-band elec-
tronic device whose function is to normalise the ampli-
tude of the transmitted pulse. In most experiments, the
transmission of the optical part, usually a resonantly ab-
sorbing medium [6, 9, 10, 11, 12] or a photonic barrier
[7, 8, 14], is low and the electronic device is an ampli-
ﬁer. To our knowledge, only one experiment [13] has
evidenced signiﬁcant superluminal eﬀects with an active
optical part (amplifying medium). The normalisation is
then achieved by a suitable attenuation. In the following,
we naturally include the normalisation device (ampliﬁer
or attenuator) in the system under consideration.

As already noted in previous papers dealing with par-
ticular arrangements (see, e.g., [5]), large superluminal
eﬀects are only attained with systems whose gain ex-
plodes outside the pulse spectrum. We will show that this
is true for any physically realisable system and determine
the lower limit to the gain norm required to observe given
superluminal eﬀects. This result is of special importance
since in a real experiment the gain-norm should be lim-
ited to avoid problems of noise (no matter its origin), of
instability and of hypersensitivity to parasitic signal and
to localised defects in the incident pulse proﬁle [6]. Con-
versely restricting the gain to realistic values determines
the upper limit to the actually observable eﬀects.

The problem is studied in the frame of the linear sys-
tems theory [15]. We denote by e(t) and s(t) the en-
velopes of the incident and transmitted pulses and by
E(ω) =
iωt)dt and S(ω) their Fourier
transforms. The envelopes are assumed to be slowly
varying at the scale of the optical period. Their Fourier
transforms are then concentrated around 0 in a region
of width small compared to the optical frequency.
In
all the sequel, t designates the local time, equal to the
real time in e(t) and retarded by the luminal transit time
L/c in s(t). The system is characterised by its impulse
response h(t) or its transfer function H(ω), such that

⊗

s(t) = h(t)
e(t) and S(ω) = H(ω)E(ω). We assume
that E(ω) and H(ω) have a ﬁnite energy and that H(ω),
Fourier transform of h(t), has a continuation H(z) in
the complex plane (z = x + iy = ρeiθ).
In our lo-
cal time picture, the relativistic causality imposes that
h(t < 0) = 0. Otherwise said, H(z) belongs to L2(R),

From a computational viewpoint, it appears natural to

Note that Hopt(ω) behaves as 1/iω for

behaviour is that of a ﬁrst order ﬁlter as used in every
detection chain. Any further ﬁltering of the high fre-
quencies will obviously damage the performances of the
system. To close this short presentation of our minimi-
sation procedure, we remark that it mainly lies on the
separation of the spectral domains where the distortion
and the gain-norm are computed. We have chosen the
pulse proﬁle leading to the simplest calculations but the
procedure might be adapted to any pulse provided that
its Fourier transform has a compact support.

Calculations of the minimum gain-norm Q, of the cor-
responding transfer function Hopt(ω) and of the transmit-
ted signal s(t) have been made for a/τp (resp. D) ranging
from 0.36 to 2.2 (resp. 2 to 30%). Satisfactorily enough,

the optimal system would allow one to conciliate signif-
icant advance, moderate distortion and reasonable gain.
For instance a = τp with D = 15% would be obtained for
Q = 100. Fig.1 shows the overall frequency-dependence
of the amplitude-gain G (ω) =
and of the phase
ϕ (ω) = arg [Hopt(ω)] in this reference case. As expected,
the gain reaches its peak-value near the frontiers of the
”stop band” (in fact the useful band for superluminal
systems). The short ringing close to these frontiers orig-
inates from the ﬁnite number of Fourier coeﬃcients used
in the calculations (N = 2000). The asymptotic values of
the phase are ϕ =
, in agreement with
Eq.4. The extra phase-rotation of 8π entails that Hopt(z)
has four zeros in the half-plane y < 0 and, consequently,
that Hopt(ω) is not minimum-phase [15]. The diﬀerences

illustrate how Hopt(ω) deviates from the ideal transfer
function Ha = eiωa in the useful band. We remark that

fective advance a by an amount approximately equal to

The eﬃciency of a superluminal system may be char-
acterised by its ability to achieve given eﬀects with gains
as small as possible. As above-noticed, the gain of all
the optimal systems has the same asymptotic behaviour
(G ∝ 1/ω) and reaches its peak-value M near ω =
1.
Consequently Q and M are roughly proportional and can
indiﬀerently characterise the system gain. The peak-gain
M , independent of the frequency scaling, is retained in
the sequel. This choice facilitates the comparison of the
optimal systems with the most eﬃcient systems used or
proposed up to now. Since high optical gains exaggerate
the problems of instability and noise (ampliﬁed sponta-
neous emission) and are diﬃcult to achieve with the suit-

able frequency-proﬁle [13] , we restrict ourselves to sys-
tems whose optical element, responsible for the superlu-
minal eﬀects, is passive. More speciﬁcally, we consider a
dilute medium involving (a) an isolated absorption-line
[6, 9, 10, 11, 12] or (b) a doublet of absorption-line [5]
and an uniform Bragg-grating written (c) on a classi-
cal optical ﬁbre [8] or (d) on a hollow ﬁbre. Since all
these elements are almost transparent outside the low-
transmission region (the useful band), the peak-gain M
is nothing but the gain of the ampliﬁer used to normalise
the amplitude of the transmitted pulse. The transfer
functions are optimised by adjusting the system param-
eters with a genetic algorithm. A rapid convergence is
obtained by starting the calculations with initial values
such that H(0) = 1 and ag = a. For the doublet (b),
the initial value of the line-splitting is chosen such that
the 2nd order distortion cancels [5]. Fig.4 shows the re-
sults obtained for a reference distortion D = 15% and

The situation is much less catastrophic when one ex-
amines the superluminal eﬀects which can be attained
for a ﬁxed peak-gain. Taking M = 1000 (realisable in
a careful experiment) and D = 15% as reference val-
ues, Fig.4 shows that the relative advance a/τp attained
with the simplest arrangement (medium with an isolated
absorption-line) is only 2.4 times below the theoretical
limit (1.6) and that the ratio falls to 1.7 by involving
a line-doublet. Using non uniform ﬁbre-Bragg-gratings
could further reduce this ratio. Indeed, at least in prin-
ciple, these elements allow one to synthesise any transfer
function in transmission as long as it is minimum-phase
[21]. This restriction entails that the optimal transfer
function (not minimum-phase) and thus the upper limit
to the advance could be approached but not equalled
with these systems. The same remark applies to the dis-
persive media whose transfer function is the exponential
of a causal function and is thus also minimum-phase [5].
Anyway, whatever the system is, superluminal advances
exceeding two times the full width at half maximum of
the pulse intensity-proﬁle are unattainable.

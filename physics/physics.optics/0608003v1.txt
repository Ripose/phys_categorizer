We demonstrate that under certain conditions,

fractional Talbot revivals can occur in
heterostructures of composite metamaterials, such as multilayer positive and negative index media,
metallodielectric stacks, and one-dimensional dielectric photonic crystals. Most importantly,
without using the paraxial approximation we obtain Talbot images for the feature sizes of transverse
patterns smaller than the illumination wavelength. A general expression for the Talbot distance
in such structures is derived, and the conditions favorable for observing Talbot eﬀects in layered
heterostructures is discussed.

PACS numbers: 42.70.Qs, 42.25.Bs, 73.21.Ac

The Talbot eﬀect, or the repeated self-imaging of periodic patterns, is one of the most basic phenomena in optics.
As a consequence of Fresnel diﬀraction, periodic patterns can reappear (also called a revival image), upon propagation,
at integer multiples of the so-called Talbot distance, ZT = 2a2/λ, where a is the spatial period of the pattern, and λ
is the wavelength of the incident light. In addition to full revivals, fractional revivals with modiﬁed periods occur at
distances that are rational fractions of the Talbot distance, i.e., z/ZT = p/q, where p and q are coprime integers. This
remarkable self-imaging phenomenon has also been demonstrated in temporal[1]-[3] and spectral[4] domains in many
areas of physics from classical optics to quantum matter waves, such as gradient-index lenses[5], waveguide arrays[6],
atomic and molecular wave packets[1, 2], and Bose-Einstein condensates[3]. Recent investigations have revealed that
the Talbot eﬀect is far more than a mere optical curiosity. It is deeply connected to classical number theory and
the intricate structure of physics[7]. Talbot eﬀects have possible applications in optical free-space interconnects[8],
integrated optics, and integer factorization schemes[9] in optical computing. In parallel, several new types of composite
metamaterials with sophisticated electromagnetic properties have been developed[10]-[14]. These materials may lay
the foundation for futuristic integrated optics and electronics. The ability to control light in certain metamaterials
has thus both scientiﬁc and practical importance. It is therefore interesting to explore Talbot eﬀects in composite
metamaterials and potential applications involving the fractional Talbot eﬀects, e.g., imaging in material fabrication
to increase the spatial frequencies of periodic patterns. One way to control wave diﬀraction is to construct multilayer
photonic structures. Although 1D periodic structures have been studied profusely, such systems still continue to reveal
some interesting results[15]-[21]. Previous works have shown that photonic bands can not only control the transmission
frequencies, but also deeply aﬀect wave diﬀraction[19]-[22], leading to nondiﬀracting beams[22] and high-resolution
imaging[21]. Typically Talbot images have been demonstrated in homogeneous media with feature sizes larger than
the wavelength. The higher order diﬀraction destroys the Talbot images when the feature sizes smaller than the
wavelength. In this letter, we show that through photonic engineering of wave diﬀraction, the fractional Talbot eﬀect
can be observed for subwavelength features of transverse patterns in inhomogeneous media, such as multilayer positive
and negative index (PNI) materials, metallodielectric (MD) nanoﬁlms, and low-dimensional double-dielectric (DD)
photonic crystals. A general expression for the Talbot distance in layered heterostructures is derived and conﬁrmed
numerically.

In any homogeneous medium, the monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld vectors and the corresponding wavevector
always form a right-handed set (E, B, k) independent of the constitutive relations of the materials. Therefore, the
continuity of the tangential ﬁeld components E
k at the interface leads to the reversed sign of the normal
component (k⊥) of the wavevector when the light is incident from a right-handed medium (RHM, ǫ > 0, µ > 0) to a
left-handed medium (LHM, ǫ < 0, µ < 0), and vice versa, while the continuity of the tangential E
k and the normal
B⊥ leads to the continuity of the tangential component (k

k) of the wavevector at the interface.

k and H

In modeling heterostructures, we assume the permittivity and permeability to be constant for the positive index
material and frequency-dependent for the negative index material. The metal is assumed to have constant permittivity
and frequency-dependent permeability. The frequency-dependent permittivity and permeability are given by the
Drude model:

where ωe and ωm are, respectively, the eﬀective electric and magnetic plasma frequencies, and γe and γm are the
corresponding damping factors. The layer thicknesses are d1 and d2, respectively, for the positive and negative index
materials. The spatial period is d = d1 + d2, thus, ǫ(z + d) = ǫ(z) and µ(z + d) = µ(z). In our layered heterostructures,

the index 1 refers to the positive index material while the index 2 refers to the negative index material, metal, or
dielectric with higher refractive index. We consider TM modes (Hz = 0) and solve for the magnetic ﬁeld out of
convenience. A similar result can be carried out for TE modes. The vector wave equation for a monochromatic ﬁeld
H = H(r) exp(−iωt) is ∇ × {ǫ−1∇ × H} = (ω/c)2µH. Thus, the equation for the x and y magnetic ﬁeld components
becomes[19]

represent the transmission of coupled evanescent waves. Equation (3) also represents the diﬀraction relation in the
multilayer medium from which the diﬀraction curve, β versus k⊥, can be derived. Thus, wave diﬀraction in the
multilayer structure can be constructed from a superposition of Bloch modes:

to a single photonic band. Since the Talbot distance (ZT ) is much larger than the period (d) of the multilayer
structure, one can take the image at the distance of an integer multiple of the period closest to the Talbot distance,
i.e. ZT = md + δ ≈ md, where m is a large integer and δ ≪ ZT . Using the fact that uβ(md) = uβ(0), Eq. (4) can be
simpliﬁed as[24]

To produce the fractional Talbot eﬀects from Eq. (5) requires a quadratic diﬀraction upon propagation. This can be
obtained by properly choosing parameters that satisfy Eq. (3).

To eﬀectively choose the system parameters and for comparison purposes, we also evaluate the dispersion
relation (Eq. (3)) within the paraxial approximation (whereby k⊥ ≪ β0, where β0 is the center Bloch wave number
β0 ≡ β(k⊥ = 0)). We thus take the Taylor expansion of Eq. (3) at β = β0:

Near the band edges, sin(β0d) ≈ 0, and subsequently the ﬁrst terms in Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) grow rapidly. Thus,
quadratic diﬀraction is achievable around the middle of the transmission bands with a reasonable spatial bandwidth.
Figure 1 shows the diﬀraction curves obtained from the exact formula Eq. (3) and from the quadratic approximation,
Eq. (6), for the MD (Fig. 1a) and DD (Fig. 1b) stacks. In Fig. 1, the diﬀraction curve in the two heterostructures
is nearly quadratic. For comparison purposes, the diﬀraction curve of free space and its quadratic approximation are
shown. All the curves are terminated at the cut-oﬀ frequency of the corresponding medium (beyond that the spatial
components cannot be transmitted). In the PNI stack, the phase compensation eﬀect of the negative index material

leads to diﬀraction compensation. Hence, quadratic diﬀraction can also appear near band edges when approaching
the non-diﬀraction limit. Figure 2 shows the diﬀraction curves near the middle of the band (Fig. 2a) and near the
band edge (Fig. 2b) in the PNI stack. The coincidence of the exact diﬀraction with the quadratic curve indicates
quadratic diﬀraction inside the PNI stack. Also the diﬀraction in the PNI stack is much less than that of free space.
Notice that in Figs. 1 and 2, the cut-oﬀ spatial frequency in heterostructures is higher than that in free space. This
property will lead to a higher resolution when transmitting images through the metamaterials. For simplicity, we
assume the periodic pattern has the same spatial period in the x and y directions. Substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (5)
and changing the integration into double summations since the spectrum is discrete. We obtained the Talbot distance
in the layered heterostructures as

ZT =

To conﬁrm our theoretical predictions, numerical simulations of fractional Talbot images are demonstrated in
Fig. 3 for the PNI stack, in Fig. 4 for the MD stack, and in Fig. 5 for the DD stack. In those ﬁgures, the left plot is
the original 2D square array while the right plot is the corresponding image at the fractional Talbot distance. The
numerical results were obtained from Eq. (5) where the β was solved numerically from Eq. (3), not from Eq. (6).
Unlike in free space where the paraxial approximation is required to observe Talbot images, upon carrying out the
integration in Eq. (5) no paraxial approximation was used. Equation (6) was used only for providing insight on how to
eﬀectively choose simulation parameters and for comparing the exact and paraxial results. Further, in our simulations
the sizes of the squares in the patterns are less than the illumination wavelength.

The interesting connection between the fractional Talbot eﬀects and number theory can be used to explain the
image patterns in Figs. 3–5. The fractional Talbot image can be represented as a ﬁnite sum of spatially shifted
subsidiary waves of the source ﬁeld[7, 25]:

For example in Fig. 3a where p/q = 1/3, the image is composed of three subsidiary waves E(x, y), E(x − a/3, y − a/3),
and E(x−2a/3, y−2a/3). Thus, the spatial frequency is three times the original frequency. In Fig. 3b where p/q = 1/6,
the non-zero components are b1, b3, and b5, so the image is also composed of three subsidiary waves, E(x−a/6, y−a/6),
E(x − a/2, y − a/2), and E(x − 5a/6, y − 5a/6). Hence, the image in Fig. 3b has the same spatial frequency as that
in Fig. 3a, but is spatially shifted by a half period. In realistic nanoplasmonic structures, material loss cannot be

avoided. The eﬀect of material loss can be mitigated by introducing gain inside the medium[26]. Typically, the
damping factor of metals is much smaller than the plasma frequency[13], γ ∼ 0.01ωe. As a demonstration, in Fig. 4
we compare the fractional Talbot images in the MD stack when γ = 0.0 fs−1, γ = 0.1 fs−1 (loss), and γ = −0.1 fs−1
(gain). In the presence of loss or gain, the Talbot distance is a complex number, thus we redeﬁne the Talbot distance
zT = |zT |2/ℜ(zT ). The Talbot image is slightly blurred when there is a loss (Fig. 4b), and is slightly sharper
as
when there is a gain (Fig. 4c).
It is well known that at a half Talbot distance the Talbot image has a reversed
contrast compared to the original pattern. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 5 in the DD structure. For practical
applications, we found when the error of layer thickness is less than 1%, the Talbot images can still be observed. Any
interlayer width variation is expected to have a minimal eﬀect since ZT ≫ d. Since femtosecond lasers are widely
used in material fabrication, for the illumination wavelength used in the DD and MD stacks, the Talbot images
are sustainable with a wavelength variation of 7% for the DD stack and 3% for the MD stack. This approximately
corresponds to a 100 fs laser pulses.

e

In conclusion we have demonstrated subwavelength-scale fractional Talbot eﬀects in layered heterostructures
of metamaterials without using the paraxial approximation. A general expression of the Talbot distance in such
structures was obtained. This expression can be used in potential applications involving Talbot eﬀects and multilayer
structures of metamaterials. The fractional Talbot eﬀect can be explored in material fabrication to increase the
spatial frequencies of the periodic patterns. This work is supported by NAVAIR’s In-House Laboratory Independent
Research (ILIR) program sponsored by the Oﬃce of Naval Research.

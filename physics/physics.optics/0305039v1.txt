We present a detailed theoretical study of the recent proposal for selective nanomanipulation of
nanometric particles above a substrate using near-ﬁeld optical forces [Chaumet et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 88, 123601 (2002)]. Evanescent light scattering at the apex of an apertureless near-ﬁeld probe
is used to create an optical trap. The position of the trap is controlled on a nanometric scale via
the probe and small objects can be selectively trapped and manipulated. We discuss the inﬂuence
of the geometry of the particles and the probe on the eﬃciency of the trap. We also consider the
inﬂuence of multiple scattering among the particles on the substrate and its eﬀect on the robustness
of the trap.

I. INTRODUCTION

Thirty years ago, it was demonstrated by Ashkin that
optical ﬁelds produce a net force on neutral particles.1,2
Since then it has been shown that it was possible to ex-
ploit the mechanical action of optical ﬁelds in a wide
range of applications. From atomic and nonlinear physics
to biology, optical forces have provided a convenient way
to manipulate, non destructively, small particles in a liq-
uid environment3–6. These optical forces can also be used
to create microstructures by optical binding,7 or measure
the van der Waals force between a dielectric wall and
an atom.8 But one of the most interesting applications
of optical forces is the the optical tweezers. They have
proved useful not only for trapping particles, but also for
assembling objects ranging from microspheres to biolog-
ical cells9,10 (notice that in Ref. [10] the trapped spheres
are 50 times larger that the wavelength used in the ex-
periment). More recently, optical tweezers have been
used to transport Bose-Einstein condensates over large
distance.11 However, most of these manipulations involve
objects whose size is of the order of one to several mi-
crometers. While for much smaller objects, such as atoms
or molecules, the scanning tunneling microscope provides
a powerful tool for manipulation and engineering12, deal-
ing with neutral particles of a few nanometers requires
new experimental approaches.

A novel approach was presented recently, where an
apertureless near-ﬁeld probe is used to create localized
optical traps and allow for the selectively capture and
manipulation of nanoparticles in vacuum or air above a
substrate .13 In this paper we analyze in detail the scheme

presented in Ref. 13 and we discuss the interplay of the
diﬀerent physical processes that contribute to the force
experienced by the particles (including van der Waals
forces). The particles are not in a liquid environment,
hence there is no Brownian motion (which would oth-
erwise induce a disruptive force for small particles) and
the apertureless probe can be used as a near-ﬁeld optical
probe to localize and select the particles14,15.

In Sec. II we describe brieﬂy the method used to com-
pute the optical forces. In Sec. III A we study the optical
force experienced by a sphere in presence of a tungsten
tip. First we explain the principle of the manipulation of
a nano-object with the apertureless probe and then we
look at the inﬂuence of the diﬀerent parameters of the
system, (geometry of the tip, size of the nanoparticle,
illumination) on the trapping. In Sec.
III B the pres-
ence of many particles on the substrate is investigated to
study the inﬂuence of neighbors on the manipulation of
a particle. Finally in Sec. IV we present our conclusions.
In appendix A we underline the importance of using to-
tal internal reﬂection to get an eﬃcient optical trap at
the tip apex, and in appendix B we compare the optical
force with the other forces present in this system (grav-
itational force, van der Waals force, electrostatic force,
and capillary force).

II. COMPUTATION OF THE OPTICAL FORCES

The theory used to compute the optical forces has been
presented previously.16. We use the couple dipole method
(CDM). Here we only recall the main steps. First, the

1

coupled dipole method17,18 is used to derive the ﬁeld in-
side the diﬀerent objects (probe and particles). Each ob-
ject is discretized into dipolar subunits and the ﬁeld at
each subunit satisﬁes the following self-consistent equa-
tion

αj(ω) is the dynamic polarizability of subunit j,19, T is
the ﬁeld linear response to a dipole in free space,20,21 and
S the ﬁeld linear response to a dipole, in the presence of
a substrate.22,23 Note that the ﬁeld obtained in Eq.(1)
takes into account all the multiple interactions between
the particles, the substrate, and the tip. The second step
is to derive the optical forces experienced by each sub-
unit. Once the electric ﬁeld is known, the component of
the total force24 on the ith subunit is given by

where u or v, stand for either x, y, or z, and p(ri, ω) is
the electric dipole moment of the ith subunit.25 Notice
that the derivative of the ﬁeld is obtained by diﬀerentiat-
ing Eq.(1). To compute the force exerted by the light on
any given object, one has to sum the force experienced
by each dipole forming the object. The main advantage
of using the CDM to compute the optical force is that
retardation and multiple scattering between the objects,
the tip and the substrate are accounted for.

III. RESULTS

We consider a particle in glass, placed either in air
or vacuum, with relative permittivity ε = 2.25 and a
radius a, above a dielectric substrate. The particle is
illuminated by two evanescent waves created by total
internal reﬂection at the substrate/air interface (angle
of incidence θ > θc = 41.8◦ with √ǫ sin θc = 1 where
ǫ = 2.25 is the relative permittivity of the substrate).
The importance of illuminating the particle on the sub-
strate with evanescent waves is explained in appendix A.
The two evanescent waves are counterpropagating , i.e.,
k′
kk =
k, with the same polarization and a random
phase relation (Fig.1). As discussed later, this is to en-
sure a symmetric lateral force. The optical trap is created
by the interaction of the incident waves with a tungsten
probe with a radius of curvature at the apex r.

Notice that all forces are computed for an irradiance of
0.05 W/µm2, which correspond, for a laser with a power
of 5 W, to a beam focused over an area of 100 µm2.

A. isolated particle

1. principle of the manipulation

In order to foster understanding of the selective trap-
ping scheme, we start by studying the interaction be-
tween a single sphere with radius a = 10 nm, and a
tungsten tip ( a tip often used in apertureless microscopy
as they are not expensive and easy to prepare) with a ra-
dius at the apex r =10 nm, which is a typical size for
tips used in experiments. The illumination wavelength
is λ = 514.5 nm. Figure 2 shows the z component of
the force experienced by the sphere versus the vertical
position of the tip above the sphere, for both TE and
TM polarizations. The illumination angle is close to the
critical angle, θ = 43◦. As the tip gets closer to the
sphere, the evolution of the force is radically diﬀerent
for the two polarizations. The sphere experiences mainly
three gradient forces (because the sphere is small, the
scattering force is negligible, and since the relative per-
mittivity is real, absorption does not contribute to the
force). The three forces are: ﬁrst, the negative gradient
force due to the evanescent incident ﬁeld (notice that for
a dielectric sphere, the gradient force always pushes the
sphere toward the region of high ﬁeld intensity, as the
evanescent ﬁeld decays in the direction of z positive, the

2

gradient force is negative), second, the negative gradient
force due to the interaction of the sphere with itself via
the substrate (this force can be understood as the inter-
action between the dipole associated to the sphere and
the ﬁeld at the dipole location, radiated by this dipole
and reﬂected by the surface; this force is always negative
whatever the dielectric constant of the sphere16), and
third, the gradient force resulting from the interaction
between the probe and the sphere. This last gradient
force can be either positive or negative. For TM illu-
mination, there is a large enhancement of the ﬁeld near
the apex of the probe due to the discontinuity across the
air/tungsten boundary26. This enhancement generates a
positive gradient force which, at short distances, coun-
terbalances the two negative contributions (due to the
interaction of the particle with itself via the substrate,
and the incident evanescent waves). The inset in Fig. 2a
shows that the force experienced by the sphere changes
sign when the tip is 25 nm away from the sphere. On the
other hand, for TE polarization (Fig. 2b), as the tip gets
closer to the particle, the magnitude of the z component
of the force increases while the force remains negative
(directed toward the substrate and away from the tip),
hence preventing any trapping. This due to a decrease
of the ﬁeld at the tip apex for this polarization (one can
see the electromagnetic ﬁeld around a gold tip apex in
Ref.[26]), thus giving a third negative contribution to the
gradient force. Because the apex of the tip and the sphere
are small compared to the wavelength, the nature of the
interaction between the tip and the sphere can be un-
derstood by considering the tip and the sphere as two
dipoles. In TM polarization, these two dipoles have two
components, parallel and perpendicular to the substrate.
As shown in Ref.[27] two aligned dipoles tend to attract
each other and two parallel dipoles tend to repel each
other. For the same magnitude of the two components
(parallel and perpendicular) the attractive force due to
the component perpendicular to the substrate is twice
that of the repulsive force due to the parallel component.
Hence in TM polarization the sphere is attracted by the
tip. For the TE polarization however, the two dipoles
are essentially parallel to the substrate and the sphere
experiences a negative gradient force. Notice that if we
only use a single laser beam, a lateral force would ap-
pear as shown in Fig. 3. For TE polarization, the lateral
force is very small (in the fN range) and negative showing
that it is mainly due to the gradient force arising from
the presence of the tip (the radiation pressure from the
incident ﬁeld always gives a force in the direction of the
wave vector, hence in this case a positive force). When
the sphere is in contact with the substrate, the lateral
force (x component) is weaker than the z component of
the force by a factor 40. As the static friction coeﬃcient
is one (glass on glass), the sphere cannot slide along the
surface. Indeed, as shown by Kawata and Sugiura,28 for
the sphere to slide on the substrate, its radius has to be
large enough for radiation pressure to overcome the gra-
dient force. For TM polarization the lateral force may

have a disruptive eﬀect as it tends to push the sphere
away from the tip, particularly when Fz becomes pos-
In order to avoid this problem, we introduce a
itive.
second, counterpropagating, evanescent wave with a ran-
dom phase relation with respect to the ﬁrst wave. In this
way, the sphere experiences no lateral force when it is
right underneath the tip. Note that due to the coherence
time of the laser (e.g. 200 ps for an Argon laser), one can
suspect that the sphere experiences spatial ﬂuctuations.
We compute these spatial ﬂuctuations for a glass sphere
with a radius a = 10 nm, trapped by an optical force
F
= 4 pN. From the second law of Newton the distance
|
|
covered by the sphere, during the time of coherence, is
equal to |F|t
2m = 8 pm. Therefore, in any realistic con-
ﬁguration, the trapped particle will only be sensitive to
the time-averaged trapping potential, without actually
being perturbed by the laser ﬂuctuations. If the sphere
is larger, its sensitivity to the spatial ﬂuctuation becomes
even smaller due to its larger weight.

To assess fully the probe-particle coupling we need to
study the evolution of the force experienced by the par-
ticle, as the probe is moved laterally. The coordinates
(x, y) represent the lateral position of the sphere. The tip
is at (0,0) (see Fig. 4a). Figure 4 shows the z component
of the force when the tip is 25 nm above the substrate,
for TE and TM polarizations, and for an angle of inci-
dence θ = 43◦. For TM polarization, Fig. 4b represents
the magnitude of the z component of the force.

We see that when the tip is far from the particle the
force is negative: the sphere does not feel the tip. As the
tip gets closer, the particle starts to experience a positive
force along z. The change of sign of the z component of
the force occurs when the sphere is about 30 nm away
laterally from the tip. Below this distance the sphere is

If the tip is farther away from the substrate, the zero

of the circle is about 7 nm when the tip is 31 nm above
the substrate (and as shown by Fig.2 it vanishes when
the tip is 45 nm above the substrate). Figure 4c, which
pertains to TE polarization, shows that the z component
of the force is always negative and smaller in magnitude
by a factor 100 than the force associated to the TM po-
larization. Note that the force becomes stronger (more
negative) when the sphere gets closer the tip. Figure
5 represents the lateral force (Fk) experienced by the
sphere when the tip scans the surface (the arrows repre-
sent the direction of the force experienced by the sphere
at the origin of the arrow, and the length of the arrows
shows the magnitude of this force). We only consider
an area of 40 nm around the origin as the lateral force
decreases very quickly away from the tip.
In Fig. 5a,
the vectors show that the sphere is attracted by the tip,
hence the lateral force pushes the sphere toward the tip.
Therefore, when the tip and the particle are close enough
to each other for the z component of the force to be pos-
itive (the zero force, Fz = 0 is always represented by
the black circle), and large enough to lift the particle oﬀ
the surface, the lateral force actually helps bringing the
particle in the trap. This eﬀect is due to the symmetric
illumination. Again TE polarization gives a diﬀerent re-
sult. Figure 5b shows that the lateral force pushes the
particle away from the tip. However, since the magni-
tude of the (downward) z component of the force is larger
than the x component by a factor of 5, we expect that
the sphere is not displaced when the tip is scanned over
it under TE illumination. Note that apertureless probes
are often used in tapping mode when imaging a surface.
This mode minimizes the lateral motion imparted to the
object by the optical force.

We have shown that a tungsten probe can be used to
trap eﬃciently a nanometric object above a surface using
TM illumination. For nanomanipulation purposes it is
important to assess the stability of the trap as the probe
lifts the particle oﬀ the substrate. Figure 6 shows the z
component of the force when the sphere is located at the
apex of the tip and the tip is moved vertically. For the
TM polarization (Fig. 6a) the optical force remains pos-
itive over a large distance, at least 200 nm. The particle
can therefore be manipulated vertically as well as hori-
zontally. The stability of the trap when the tip-particle
pair is away from the substrate prevents any disruptive
interaction with the surface roughness as shown in the
next section. Note that the evolution of the force versus
the distance to the substrate is linear rather than ex-
ponential. The particle experiences a negative gradient
force due the exponential decay of the intensity of the
illumination. At the same time, the particle experiences
a positive gradient force due to the ﬁeld enhancement at
the tip apex, which also decreases exponentially with z
because this enhancement depends on the intensity of the
evanescent illuminating light. The competition between
these two contributions results in a weak decrease of the
trapping force as the particle is moved away from the
substrate.

As described in13, the procedure to trap a small object
with a tungsten tip is the following: ﬁrst TE illumination
is used while the tip scans the surface in tapping mode or
in constant-height mode if the area under investigation
is small enough. Such modes avoid the displacement of
the particle by the tip. Once an object has been selected,
the probe is placed above the object and the polarization
of the illumination is rotated to TM. The probe is then
brought down over the particle and captures it. The
probe can then move the particle above the substrate,
both horizontally and vertically, to a new position (note
that if, for some reason, one wishes to move the parti-
cle over distances larger than the size of the illumination
spot, one could move the sample with a piezoelectric de-
vice once the sphere is trapped at the apex of the tip). As
shown by Fig. 6b, as the z component of the force in TE
polarization is always negative, the nanoparticle can be
released by switching back to TE polarization. The lack
of trapping under TE illumination is actually an impor-
tant advantage during both the imaging (selection) and
release phases of the manipulation.
Indeed, under TE
illumination, when the tip is above a particle, it actually
increases the downward optical force, which contributes
to prevent the tip from sweeping the particle away.

2. Eﬃciency of the manipulation scheme

In the previous section we have established the pos-
sibility to manipulate selectively a nanoparticle above a
ﬂat dielectric substrate. Now we study the inﬂuence of
the diﬀerent parameters of the system (tip radius at the
apex, angle of incidence, etc) on the eﬃciency of the trap.
a. Inﬂuence of the illumination So far we have con-
sidered an angle of incidence of 43 degrees, which corre-
sponds to a slow decay of the evanescent ﬁeld above the
substrate.

Figures 7 and 8 show the inﬂuence of the angle of in-
cidence on the capability of the tip to manipulate the
nano-object. Figure 7 shows the evolution of the z com-
ponent of the force as the tip gets closer the surface,
versus the angle of incidence for both polarizations. In
Fig.7a (TM polarization) one can see that for a ﬁxed dis-
tance between the tip and the substrate, the larger the

6

angle of incidence, the smaller the magnitude of the force
experienced by the trapped object. Note that as the an-
gle of incidence increases, the initial (evanescent) ﬁeld
decays faster. Accordingly, a weaker ﬁeld reaches the tip
and the enhancement of the ﬁeld at the tip apex is less
important leading to a smaller positive gradient force. As
a consequence, when the tip approaches the sphere, the
change of sign for the z component of the force occurs
for smaller tip-sphere distances at larger angles of inci-
dence (Cf. the thick line on Fig. 7a which represents the
level curve Fz = 0). For example for θ = 43◦, z=25 nm
and for θ = 73◦, z=8 nm. This means that it is easier
to manipulate the sphere when the angle of incidence is
close to the critical angle. Notice that for TE polariza-
tion (Fig. 7b), when the angle of incidence increases,
the magnitude of the negative z force decreases. The ex-
planation for this evolution is similar to that of the TM
polarization case: the incident ﬁeld that reaches the apex
of the tip is weaker for large angles of incidence. Accord-
ingly, the interaction between the tip and the particle
becomes weaker as the angle increases, and the magni-
tude of the repulsive force decreases. Figure 8 represents
the z force experienced by the sphere when it is located at
the apex of the tip, versus the angle of incidence and the
distance between the trapped sphere and the substrate.
The force along z decays more rapidly for larger angles
of incidence. The exponential decay of the incident ﬁeld
is stronger when the angle of incidence is far from the
critical angle. As the positive force along z is due to the
enhancement of the ﬁeld at the apex of the tip and it de-
pends on the value of the incident evanescent ﬁeld at the
tip apex, the z component of the force follows the same
behavior as the incident ﬁeld. Note that the inﬂuence of
the wavelength is easy to infer. The initial ﬁeld decays as
e−γz with γ =
1)/λ, where λ is the wave-
−
length in vacuum. When λ increases, γ decreases, hence
the exponential decay is slower and the manipulation is
easier to perform.

b. Inﬂuence of the geometry

In the previous section,
both the radius of the tip r, and the radius of the sphere
a were 10 nm. In this paragraph we study the inﬂuence
of these two geometrical parameters. Figure 9 shows the
evolution of the force along z versus a, for both polariza-
tions, and two angles of incidence. The tip (r=10 nm)
is in contact with the sphere. One might expect a force
proportional to a3 as the gradient force is proportional to
the real part of the polarizability, hence to the volume of
the sphere. Actually, this behavior is only observed for
the TE polarization (Fig. 9b). For the TM polarization,
when a increases, so does the distance between the tip
and the substrate. Thus we have a competition between
the increase of the gradient force due to a larger a and
the decrease of the ﬁeld enhancement at the tip apex due
to a larger distance between the tip and the substrate.
For the smallest angle (θ = 43◦), because the decrease of
the ﬁeld is slow, the force starts by increasing linearly for
small values of a. When a increases, the enhancement of

the ﬁeld at the tip decreases and the positive gradient
force due to this enhancement vanishes. The competi-
tion between these two eﬀects leads to a maximum of the
force for a=40 nm. For the largest angle (θ = 60◦) the
incident ﬁeld decays rapidly in that case, and for a larger
than 40 nm the z force experienced by the sphere becomes
negative. Thus it would not be possible to manipulate a
larger particle. For TE polarization the z component of
the force varies roughly as a3. This implies that the main
contribution to the force is due to the incident ﬁeld: the
tip has a very weak inﬂuence on the force experienced
by the sphere. To check this argument we plot the force
along z without the presence of the tip (line with the “+”

of the tip (see inset in ﬁg.9b). For the smallest angle
(θ = 43◦) the presence of the tip shifts the force curves
toward negative values, as explained in the previous sec-
tion. This holds even for a very large radius of the sphere
because of the slow evanescence of the incident ﬁeld.

We must now check that for large radii it is always pos-
sible to manipulate the sphere above the substrate. Fig-
ure 10 shows the z component of the force at two diﬀerent
angles of incidence for two diﬀerent radii: a =30 nm and
50 nm. One can see that it is possible to lift the spheres
up to 200 nm above the surface without any problem,
even for the case θ = 60◦ with a = 30 nm which cor-
responds to a radius close to the limiting case (Fig. 9a
shows Fz = 0 for a = 40 nm if θ = 60◦). In that case, the
force is small and the trap is less robust than for smaller
angles of illumination. Therefore, the trapping scheme
presented here works over a wide range of particle sizes.
Notice that although we could not compute the largest
radius that we could manipulate at θ = 43◦ because it
would require too many subunits, we can estimate that
spheres with a radius up to around 90 nm can be trapped
and manipulated.

Another relevant geometric parameter is the radius of
curvature at the apex of the tip. It is easy to see the im-
portance of this parameter for our optical trap because
the enhancement of the ﬁeld at the tip apex depends di-
rectly on this radius. Figure 11 shows the z component
of the force versus r, for a particle with radius a =10 nm,
for two diﬀerent angles of incidence. One can see that the
z component of the force depends strongly on the radius
of the tip apex. For θ = 43◦ the squares are the CDM
results and show a decay of the force for larger radii. The
solid line is a ﬁt of the form a0/r +a1 where a0 and a1 are

that the vertical force experienced by the two side spheres
remains negative when the probe moves away from the

the spheres on the sides do not hinder the capture of
the middle sphere if the angle of incidence is adequately
chosen.

B. Many particles on the surface

In the preceding section we studied the case of an iso-
lated sphere to illustrate how to select and manipulate
a nano-object above a surface. It is nevertheless impor-
tant to know whether the proposed manipulation scheme
would still work if several particles are clustered together.
We consider a set of three spheres (radius 10 nm, permit-
tivity 2.25) aligned along the x axis. The probe is placed
above the middle sphere. We account for the multiple
scattering between the three spheres, the substrate, and
the tip. The optical binding induced among the spheres27
is also included in our description. For this conﬁguration
again, TE illumination does not permit trapping. For
TM illumination, we plot in Fig. 12 the z component of
the force experienced by the middle sphere and by those
on the sides as a function of the vertical distance be-
tween the probe and the middle sphere. For an angle
of incidence θ = 43◦, as the tip gets closer to the mid-
dle sphere, the z component of the force, although the
strongest for the middle sphere, remains positive for the
two side spheres. This could be a problem if one wanted
to manipulate only one particle among several. The cen-
tral particle can be selectively trapped by increasing the
angle of incidence of the illuminating beams to tighten
the trap in the x direction. In Fig. 12 we see that for
θ = 60◦ the optical force induced by the probe is positive
only for the middle sphere. This remains true for three
spheres aligned along y. Figure 13 shows the extraction
of the middle sphere by the tip. Our calculation shows

spheres.

Notice that this computation is done for three iden-
tical spheres. We show in Fig. 14 that if the middle
sphere is larger than the other two, it is still possible
to trap the middle sphere without disturbing the side
spheres. Figure 14a shows the z component of the force

8

experienced by the middle sphere for three diﬀerent radii:
a=10, 17, and 28 nm. The side spheres have a ﬁxed ra-
dius: a =10 nm. When the middle sphere is lifted oﬀ
the surface by the tip (angle of incidence θ = 60◦) the
force along z is always positive, hence the manipulation
of the middle sphere is not disturbed by the side spheres.
Figure 14b shows the evolution of the z force experienced
by the sides spheres during the extraction of the middle
sphere. This force is always negative, therefore the side
spheres are not attracted by the tip. Moreover, as the
radius of the middle sphere increases, the z component
of the force becomes larger while being negative, thus
excluding the possibility of having the side spheres cap-
tured by the tip. This reﬂects the fact that as the radius
of the middle sphere increases, so does the distance be-
tween the side spheres and the apex of the tip. Hence
as the tip is farther from the sides sphere its inﬂuence is
weaker.

In Fig. 15 we present the case where the middle sphere
is smaller than the side spheres. First for an angle of in-
cidence close to the critical angle (θ = 43◦) the three
spheres experience a positive force when the tips ap-
proaches the substrate. If we look carefully (see the in-
set), we see that the z component of the force becomes
positive for the side spheres before the middle sphere ex-
periences a positive force. Hence it is impossible to only
manipulate the middle sphere. If the angle of incidence is
increased to the value θ = 60◦ to make the trap smaller,
we show that the z component of the force becomes pos-
itive for the middle sphere ﬁrst. However, when the tip
is in contact with the middle sphere the z force is pos-
itive for all three spheres. Notice that to get a smaller
trap one can increase the angle of incidence but in that
case the force would be very small compare to the other

9

force in the system (see appendix A and B). Therefore, in
this case it is impossible to capture selectively the mid-
dle sphere. The solution would be to ﬁrst move the side
spheres aways to isolate the smaller middle sphere, and
only after would it be possible to trap it. Notice that
when the tip is far from the surface the negative force
is stronger for the largest spheres. This is due to the
gradient force proportional to a3.

In the previous section we showed that a tungsten
probe can be used to trap eﬃciently a nanometric ob-
ject above a surface using TM illumination. By moving
the tip laterally, it is possible to transport the selected
particle in a precise manner. However, we must check
that the electromagnetic ﬁeld scattered by another par-
ticle on the substrate would not disturb the trap during
the transport. Figure 16 shows the evolution of the force
experienced by the sphere trapped by the tip when a sec-
ond sphere is on the surface as show by Fig. 16a (both
spheres have a radius of 10 nm). Figure 16b shows that
the z component of the force on the trapped sphere is not
altered by the presence of the other sphere. When the
two spheres are 30 nm apart (h = 50 nm), the force along
z does not depend on the position of the tip. Figure 16c
shows that the lateral force is more sensitive and we can
see some oscillations when the two spheres are close to
each other. However, this is not really a problem since
even if the two spheres are only 30 nm apart, the lateral
force is a thousand times smaller that the force along
z, and therefore, would not hinder the optical trapping.
We have studied the case where the tip and the trapped

sphere scan the surface at h = 20 nm. When the tip is
located at the origin, the two spheres are in contact (the
trapped sphere and the sphere on the substrate) and the
z component of the force becomes negative, of the order
of -5 pN, and the lateral force when the spheres are close
to each other is about 1 pN. In this conﬁguration the
trapped sphere can escape and thus be lost by the tip.
In summary, if the distance between the two spheres is
larger than three times the radius of the sphere on the
surface, then the trapped sphere is not disturbed.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have presented a detailed study of a trapping
scheme that allows one to trap and nanomanipulate, in a
selective manner, nanometric particles in air above a sub-
strate. The substrate is illuminated under total internal
reﬂection by two laser beams which create two counter-
propagating evanescent waves. An apertureless tungsten
probe is used to scatter these two waves and generate a
localized optical trap. An object of a few nanometers can
be selectively brought into the trap and manipulated with
the probe. An important advantage of this scheme is the
possibility to use the probe to localize the particles upon

10

the surface. Using TE polarization the tip can scan the
surface in tapping mode or constant-height mode, and
allow one to acquire an optical near-ﬁeld image of the
surface. Because in TE polarization the z component of
the optical force is directed toward the substrate, there
is no risk of displacing the particles during the imaging
phase. Then, just by switching to TM polarization, we
can manipulate the particles. As we showed, even if many
particles are clustered, varying the angle of incidence still
makes it possible to manipulate selectively only one par-
ticle.

An interesting extension of this work will be a study
of the inﬂuence of diﬀerent illuminations (e.g.
focused
beam), and the study when the particle is either ab-
sorbing or metallic.
In that case the optical force has
two contributions: the gradient force and the momentum
transfer from the laser to the particle due to absorption.
For metallic particles, the strong spectral dependence of
the electromagnetic response (or the resonances in the
response of dielectric and metallic particles) could lead
to new eﬀects. For example at some wavelength the gra-
dient force on a silver particle vanishes, and only the
absorbing force remains. Such phenomena could lead to
a material selective trapping. It will also be interesting to
explore the possibility of trapping a small gold particle,
a few nanometers in size, and use it as a highly localized
probe for topographic or spectroscopic studies29,30.

APPENDIX A: IMPORTANCE OF THE
EVANESCENT ILLUMINATION

In this appendix we show that the choice of total in-
ternal reﬂection illumination is the most adequate to get
a strong optical force. Figure 17 shows the z compo-
nent of the force when the angle of incidence is varied
between 0 and 90 degrees for an illumination either from
above or from below the surface. For an illumination
from below the surface (internal reﬂection), and for TM
polarization, the largest force is obtained for θ = θc. The
magnitude of the force decreases exponentially when θ
increases. For θ smaller than the critical angle, the force
is small and even negligible for θ smaller than 20 degrees.
For TE polarization the minimum of the z component of
the force is obtained for θ = 43◦ > θc. This negative
force is important as it prevents the tip from displacing
If the surface is illuminated
the particle during scans.
from above, for TM polarization the z components of
the force remains weaker that the force obtained with an
evanescent wave, and for TE polarization the negative
force is very weak compared to those obtained with an
evanescent wave above the surface. Hence to trap and
manipulate a nano-object it is best to choose an angle of
incidence close to but larger than the critical angle.

APPENDIX B: DISCUSSION ON THE ROLE OF
FORCES OTHER THAN THE OPTICAL FORCE

In an actual experiment, there would be other forces
attracting the sphere toward the substrate. These forces
are mainly four: van der Waals, electrostatic, capillary,
and gravitational forces. One must therefore compare
their eﬀect with that of the optical forces in order to
assess the robustness of the scheme.

1. The van der Waals force

The van der Waals force31 between two particles
(which is the Casimir force in the nonretarded case32)
can be described as a short range force, derived from the
Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential, in the form

Fw =

z6
4h6 −

AS
6h2

(cid:18)

1

,

(cid:19)

(B1)

h being the distance between the two particles, A the
Hamaker constant (A = 60 zJ for glass, and about 200 zJ
for tungsten), z corresponds to the separation of lowest
energy between two particles (i.e.
the position of the
minimum of the Lennard-Jones potential) that we have
estimated at 0.5 nm, and S is the Derjaguin geometrical
factor related to the mutual curvature of the two parti-
cles. Notice that the van der Waals force is maximum
when z = h.

If we compute the van der Waals force between the
glass sphere and the glass surface we have S = a (a ra-
dius of the sphere), hence the force is Fw = 0.3 pN. This

11

×

force is not a problem as the optical force when the tip is
in contact with the sphere is larger than 1 pN. In addi-
tion we have to consider the van der Waals force between
the apex of the tip and the sphere when they are in con-
tact. We have estimated it for the case where the radius
of the sphere and the curvature of the tip apex are equal
to 10 nm, with S = a/2 = 5 nm, A = √60
200 zJ,
for which we obtain Fw = 0.27 pN. Hence the two van
der Waals forces are of comparable magnitude and can-
cel each other out when the particle is in contact with
both the substrate and the tip. Therefore the van der
Waals force does not hamper the manipulation of the
particle. A problem can arise when we want to release
the sphere from the trap, as switching back to TE polar-
ization may not create a strong enough repulsive force.
There are many ways to avoid this problem. One is to
approach the tip-sphere system to the surface to bene-
ﬁt from the van der Waals force between the substrate
and the sphere. Another solution is to choose an angle of
incidence close to the critical angle to increase the mag-
nitude of the repulsive force. Of course, one could also
increase the intensity of the incident ﬁeld.

Notice that the van der Waals force is computed here
for perfectly smooth bodies. In reality this force should
be weaker. Indeed, for a surface roughness about 2 nm,
the van der Waals force is reduced by a factor of 10.33

2. The electrostatic force

The electrostatic force (Coulomb force) between an
electrically charged sphere and an uncharged plane can
be expressed as33

Fe =

π
ε0

ε
1
−
ε + 1

a2σ2,

(B2)

σ being the charge surface density (10−3 Cm−2 in very
dry conditions), ε0 = 8.85.10−12 Fm−1 the permittivity
of vacuum, and ε the relative permittivity of the dielec-
tric substrate. For a = 10 nm and ε = 2.25, we get
Fe = 0.013 pN. This force is clearly negligible compared
to the optical force. And moreover this force will be
weaker for a conductor.33

3. The capillary force

If there is water on the surface, there will be a capillary

force which can be expressed as33

Fc = 2πaγ,

(B3)

γ being the surface tension of water. With γ =
72.10−3 Nm−1. For a radius of the sphere a = 10 nm
we get Fc = 4.5 pN. This force is of the same order as
the optical force hence it is necessary to work in a dry
environment in order to reduce this capillary force.

4. The gravitational force

The force of gravity is

(B4)

πa3ρg

Fg = mg =

4
3
where g = 10 ms−2 is the gravitational acceleration and
ρ = 2500 kgm−3 is the density of glass. If the radius is
equal to 10 nm we ﬁnd Fg = 0.1 aN, and the z component
of the optical force experienced by the sphere is larger (by
a factor 107) than the gravitational force. Hence gravity
can be neglected.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, in a dry environment (no capillary force)
only the van der Waals force could perturb the release of
the particle but as we mentioned previously, this force
becomes weaker when roughness is taken into account.
Note, however, that these four forces do not depend of
the illumination whereas the optical forces depends of the
intensity of the incident ﬁeld. Therefore, one solution to
avoid any disruptive contribution from the van der Waals
force is to increase the power of the laser beam. For ex-
ample, with the power used by Okamoto and Kawata34,
which corresponds to an irradiance of 0.2 W/µm2, the
optical force is multiplied by a factor 4 compared to the
computation presented in this manuscript. Another way
of increasing the optical force is to choose another ma-
terial for the probe. For example, at a wavelength of
450 nm, a silver tip when in contact with the sphere,
generates an optical force six times stronger than that
created by a tungsten tip at λ = 514.5 nm.

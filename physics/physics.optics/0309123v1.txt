Superluminal Phenomena as Instantaneous
Transferring of Excitations in Correspondence
with the Wigner Principle of Causality
Mark E. Perel’man ∗)
(Racah Institute of Physics, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel)

It is shown that the transferring of light signal faster-than-c can take place
exclusively as the instantaneous quantum tunneling. Its extent (space size of
instanton) must be inversely relative to lack of energy till nearest stable or
resonant state. ”Superluminality” leads to nonlocality ”in small”, in a near
ﬁeld zone, and can be described by 4-vector Aµ, the E and H ﬁelds remain
local.

These assertions are proven, independently, in the frameworks of general ﬁeld
theory and by the theory of time duration of scattering, with taking into ac-
count the entropy growing. They are correlated with peculiarities of tunneling
and frustrated total reﬂection. The results correspond to the Wigner formu-
lation of causality: ”The scattered wave cannot escape a scatterer before the
initial wave reaches it” and are conformed to experimental data on superluminal
transferring.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the experiments [1-10] has been observed that the light signal could be
transferred on deﬁnite distances via specially chosen media with speed greater
vacuum light velocity (”superluminal” or ”light faster-than-c”). Almost in all
theoretical researches it has been adopted, from the outset, that such exotic
speed is unreal, primary impossible, and therefore these observations would
be explainable by some reformulation of interference conditions, by account of
reshaping of pulses form and so on (e.g. [11-13]).

However, these experimental data can be considered as some manifestation
of reality of the superluminal phenomena. Such point of view requires search
of the exclusive conditions and opportunities at which superluminal phenomena
are not absolutely impossible. Therewith such possibilities must be revealed on
the most general basis without introduction of any additional hypotheses, and
just such approach is the main purpose of the paper.

Let us begin with overview of the experimental data. Superluminal trans-
mission of light pulses (or of its forward front only?) through some media has
been registered in rareﬁed gas [1] (the most impressive observations of this ef-
fect have been made nearby the resonant frequencies [2, 3]), as well as under
propagation of microwaves through the air (several experiments of two indepen-
dent groups [4]). The superluminal speed of light pulses has been registered
also at their propagation through solid-state ﬁlms [5] and interfering ﬁlters [6],
at frustrated total internal reﬂection (FTIR [7]). It results in some features of

1

diﬀraction pictures [8] and even the speed of front of ionization can be super-
luminal [9]. Moreover, in electronic systems such phenomena can be observed
also [10]. Reviews of many experimental data and some theoretical models are
given in [11] and in the proceedings of conferences [12], but we do not consider
these models here [13].

These observations are indicative for the reality of the superluminal propaga-
tion or of signal transferring, at least along comparatively small, characteristic
distances, and require a reasonable theoretical interpretation. Notice that to
these observations must be added the long time noted discrepancy with results
of tunneling calculations that show negative duration of such transitions (e.g.
[14]).

How the strict restriction of signal speed over the large distances can be

reconciled with these observations?

The regular measurements of signal speed were carried out in the far ﬁeld,
i.e. at distances, which are by far larger than characteristic scales, determined
by the wavelengths and/or the uncertainty relations. Hence the superluminal
phenomena could be only attributed to such scales that are negligible in the
far ﬁeld measurements, i.e. they should be limited by a near ﬁeld zone. The
energy propagation (group) speed determined by the Poynting’s vector in far
ﬁeld could remain subluminal.

The question under consideration arises from the beginning for some speciﬁ-
cation of the causality principle itself. Its conventional statement: ”No outgoing
signal can leave a point before it is reached by the initial one” is essentially clas-
sical. It is not applicable literally to the quantum theory of measurements, does
not admitting so exact localization of the area of absorption and/or emission.
Thereby, one has to adopt the weaken formulation given by Wigner [15]: ”The
scattered wave can not leave a scatterer before the initial wave reaches it”, which
can be viewed as the general (or quantum) causality principle. It must be noted
that the Wigner principle is reconcilable, in particular, with occurrence of some
items distinct from zero outside of the light cone in the causal propagator - just
they are suggestive for the appearance of superluminal phenomena [16].

The singularity and apparent exotic character of a problem requires its re-
search from diﬀerent standpoints. Therefore we shall begin our consideration
from the rigorous mathematical, but suﬃciently general investigation of an op-
portunity of existence and properties of the superluminal phenomena in the
scope of general ﬁeld theory, without concretization of media, in which can be
observed such phenomena (Section 2, the Appendix A).

Then we consider an opportunity of description of superluminal phenomena
within the framework of general theory of time delay with taking into account
restrictions, which are imposed on parameters of processes by the requirements
of entropy growth (Section 3-1, the Appendix B).

The opportunities of conﬁrmation of general results are considered within
the quantum electrodynamics (QED, Subsection 3-2), in the theory of tunneling
(Subsection 3-3) and, in particular, in the phenomenon of the frustrated total
internal reﬂection (FTIR, Subsection 3-4) as the most known and the most old
example of tunneling. Then in the Section 4 we carry out comparison of our

2

results with experimental data. Some possible models and interpretations of
results are discussed in the Section 5 and thereby are outlined some possibilities
of further investigations.

As the method used in the Section 2 is not traditional one, let’s forewarning
it by such remarks. We examine passage of a signal throw linear, homoge-
neous, stationary medium (without its further concretization). This process is
described by the integral relationship:

R

dt′dr′R(t − t′, r − r′) I(t′, r′). (1.1)

O(t, r) =
The set of response functions {R(t, r)} of this system may be divided for-
mally on two classes: the set of local functions {RL(t, r)}, for which ct ≥ r, and
the set of nonlocal functions {RN L(t, r)}, which are characterized by nonequality
ct < r and thereby described the superluminal signal (energy) transferring only.
The analysis of such rigorous division of functions of response onto two classes
shows the exact limitation of peculiarities of the class of nonlocal functions.

The further analysis of this class of functions will showed, that the instant
transfer of signal can occur only onto the certain distances a, which must be
determined by the diﬀerence between the energy of scattered particle and the en-
ergy of nearest stable or resonant state. Moreover, such transition can take place
exclusively by the tunneling, i.e. they present a pure quantum phenomenon and
corresponding response function does not depend on magnitudes of vectors E
and H. Therefore, just as in the eﬀects of Aharonov-Bohm [17], Casimir (e.g.
[18]) and so on, superluminal phenomena should be described via potential Aµ
only.

All subsequent items demonstrate concretization and illustrations of these
principal results. Notice that the outstripping of particles on completely deter-
mined distances can be described as the ”gain duration” in its kinematics and
is not reﬂected on properties of far ﬁeld.

2. PERMISSIBLE FORMS OF RESPONSE FUNC-

TIONS

2-1. LOCAL AND NONLOCAL INTERACTIONS
The method of division of response functions on various classes is based on
usage of projectors of properties of physical systems introduced by von Neumann
[19] for description of qualitative (alternative) properties of systems, which are
completely present or are completely absent, such as causality, locality, mass-
spectrality, deﬁnite symmetries, etc.

In the quantum mechanics projectors of type Pψ = |ψi hψ| are used for sepa-
ration of certain states of systems in the Hilbert space, on the base of which are
constructed matrices of density [20], etc. Unlike it, we shall consider projectors
of allowable supports of response functions (areas of change of variables, out-
side of which functions equal zero) in the usual time-space, the corresponding
method was proposed and developed in [21, 22].

Projectors of locality (of light cone) PL and of nonlocality (the areas outside

of light cone) PN L are, accordingly, represented as

PL(x) = θ(x2) ≡ θ(t2 − r2),

PN L(x) = 1 − θ(x2) ≡ θ(−x2). (2.1)

3

Any function can be decomposed on local and nonlocal parts: R(x) =
RL(x) + RN L(x). These parts can be separated from any function by the ap-
propriate projector:

RL(x) = PL(x) R(x),
The condition of completeness, PL + PN L = 1 (see the Appendix A), allows

RN L(x) = PN L(x) R(x) . (2.2)

to deduce from (2.2) the equations of orthogonality for these functions:

PN L(x) RL(x) = 0; (2.3)
PL(x) RN L(x) = 0, (2.4)
i.e. the projector of light cone PL is orthogonal to functions with support

out of the cone, etc.

From the law of energy conservation for classical systems or from the prin-
ciple of unitarity for quantum systems follows that functions, which describe
input and output signals, are square integrable. Therefore for them and for
the function of medium response R(t, r) exist the complete and partial Fourier-
transforms (in the rigged Hilbert space [21] at least):

O(ω, k) = R(ω, k) I(ω, k) (1.1’)
(functions and their Fourier-transforms are designated by the same symbol
and diﬀer by arguments). The Fourier-transformation of (2.3) to (ω, k)- repre-
sentation with simultaneous account of causality (the projector PC (x) = θ(−t),
i.e. at allocation only the bottom part of light cone) leads to relativistic general-
ization of Kramers-Kr¨onig dispersion relations of complex structure [22], though
admitting the approximated forms [23].

Let’s consider these equations of restriction in other variables. In variables

(t, k) the projector gets a kind:
PL(t|k) ≡ Fk[PL(t, r)] = ( 1

2π )3

dre−ikrθ(t2−r2) = 1

2π2k3 [sin(kt)−kt cos(kt)].

(2.5)

R
Hence, PL(t|k) → δ(k) at t → ∞, and at t → 0 it is presented as
PL(t|k) → 1
The Fourier transformation of (2.3) leads to the integral equation for local

(−1)n+1 n (kt)2n+1. (2.6)

functions in these variables:

R

dq PL(t|q) RL(t|k − q), (2.7)

RL(t|k) =
from which, via (2.6) and so on, some asymptotic estimations can be received.
The research of features of completely nonlocal transfer functions on the
basis of (2.4) is the most interesting. The Fourier transform of this equation
results in the equation:

dq PL(t|q) RN L(t|k − q) = 0. (2.8)

As its feasibility does not depend on magnitudes of t and k, it is reduced to
R

the algebraic equation:

variable t.

PL(t|q) RN L(t|k − q) = 0, (2.9)
and its equality to zero is determined by features of PL(t|q) as function of

On the basis of fundamental deﬁnition ξ × δ(ξ) = 0 can be shown that if
function P (x) is nonsingular with only isolated zeros in the points xm (not higher
n-th order), the general solution of the algebraic equation P (x) × f (x) = 0 is of
the such form:

4

n
0
P

m an,m δ(n)(x − xm) (2.10)

f (x) = A δ(P (x)) =
with arbitrary factors an,m, which other reasons or models may determine.
Hence, the solution of (2.9) has the form:
RN L(t|k, q) = f (t|k, q) δ(PL(t|k)), (2.11)
and it is necessary to determine in the argument of δ-function its zeros as
function of temporary variable. As in the expression (2.5) the values kt =
2πn are no its roots, from the argument of δ-function can be factored out
cos(kt)/2π2k3, and thus in (2.11) remains δ(tan(kt) − kt). The ﬁrst numeri-
cal roots of the transcendent equation tan x = x are equal to 0; 4.493; 7.725;
(approximately). As it will be shown below, the minimal extent of path at non-
local interaction is equal to the wavelength λ, therefore if kt = b, the maximal
speed of pulse transfer must be u ≈ λ/t = 2πc/b. Hence, at decomposition of
the argument of δ-function all roots, except the ﬁrst two, can be omitted.

In accordance with (2.6) the zero in point t = 0 is of the third order and

consequently the general solution of (2.11) must be written down as

RN L(t|k, q) = Aδ(PL(t|k, q)) = ϕ0δ(t) + ϕ1δ′(t) + ϕ2δ′′(t) + ϕ3δ(t − 4.5/k)

+... .(2.12)

with arbitrary functions ϕn = ϕn(k, q). Last term of (2.12) results to
λ/t ˜ 1.4c and apparently is of type of harbinger or aftershock and therefore
further is not examined.

Other terms of (2.12) show that if there is the nonlocal transfer of interaction,
it should occur instantaneously, without dependence on time and consequently
must be described by the stationary Laplace equation. The substitution of
RN L(t, r) in (1.1) leads to the expression

ON L(t, r) =

dr′[f0(r − r′) + f1(r − r′)(∂/∂t) + f2(r − r′)(∂/∂t)2] I(t, r′),

(2.13)

Z

where functions fn(r), which describe medium, are not concretized. The
expression (2.13) show that the nonlocal causal response of system depends on
spatial properties of medium and on velocity and acceleration of the source
changing, i.e. on forces operating in it.

The instantaneous transferring of all three characteristics of process is nec-
essary and is suﬃcient for complete restoration of the initial form and dynamics
of process. Three spatial transfer functions included in (2.13) can be considered
as independents, concerning, accordingly, to static, kinematical and dynamic
parts of nonlocal ﬁeld.

2-2. DISTANCES OF INSTANTANEOUS JUMPS OF PHO-

TONS

Let’s consider the projector describing instant jump of particle into the
x direction on distances not smaller a. Projectors of such property should
include the bottom part and the top part of light cone remote at the moment
t = 0 on distance a:

Pa(t, x) = θ(−t)θ(t2 − x2) + θ(t)θ(t2 − (x + a)2). (2.14)
This projector separates within the whole set of response functions those

functions, which correspond to jump on distances not smaller a:

5

Ra(t, r) = Pa(t, x) R(t, r). (2.15)
Thereby they should satisfy the equation of orthogonality:
(1 − Pa(t, x)) Ra(t, r) = 0. (2.15’)
Fourier-transform of the projector in (2.15’) as function of temporary vari-

Fω[1 − Pa(t, x)] = 1
and the response function of system describing instant jumps on distances

2πiω (e−iω|x| − e−iω|x+a|), (2.16)

able has the form:

l ≥ a is of type

Ra(ω|r) = f (ω|r) ω δ(ie−iω|x+a| − ie−iω|x|). (2.17)
The zeros of argument of δ-function correspond to the equality ωa = 2πn.
Thus the spatial extent of instant jumping can be equal to one or several wave-
lengths:

n = 1, 2, 3, ..., (2.18)

a = nλ,
i.e. exceeds, already with n = 1, the meaning of uncertainty (∆x ∆k ≥ 1
2 ,
∆x ≈ a, ∆k ≈ 2π/λ). Thereby the ”gain time” at the jump is equal to ∆T =
n λ/c and can be measurable. (Such possibility was announced in [24].)

If the considered process is determined by the diﬀerence between energies of
scattered particle and of stable (or resonant) state ∆ω = ω − ω0, it is necessary
to carry out, already in (2.15), the appropriate subtraction:

Ra(ω|r) − Ra(ω0|r) → Ra(∆ω|r). (2.19)
The replacement ω → ∆ω in (2.16) leads to the length of instant tunnel

jump:

in the experiments [2].

a = (2πc/∆ω) n,
that corresponds, at n = 1, to the distance or to the ”gain time”, measured

n = 1, 2, 3, ..., (2.18’)

2-3. ENERGY-MOMENT RELATION
The interaction functions (matrix elements of transition) in variables (ω, k)
can be naturally divided, up to an exit on the mass surface, onto two classes:
RE(ω, k), at which |ω| > |k|, i.e. there is a surplus of energy relative to mo-
ment, and RN E(ω, k), at which |ω| < |k|, i.e. the energy is lesser than value
appropriate to moment.

By introducing the projectors of 4-cone (ω, k),
PN E(ω, k) = θ(k2 − ω2) ≡ 1 − PE(ω, k), (2.20)
PE(ω, k) = θ(ω2 − k2),
we receive, by the exact analogy with (2.3-4), the equations of orthogonality:
PN E(ω, k) RE(ω, k) = 0, (2.21)
PE(ω, k) RN E(ω, k) = 0. (2.22)
The Fourier transforms of these projectors to variables (t, k) are
PN E(t|k) = 1
2π
πt
PE(t|k) = δ(t) − PN E(t|k). (2.23’)
The Equation (2.21) results, in view of the condition of causality (fE(t|k) = 0

−k dω e−iωt = sin(kt)
R

, (2.23)

k

at t > 0), in the integral relation:

t

Z

−∞

dt′ RE(t − t′|k) sin(kt′)

πt′ = 0. (2.24)

6

As integrand does not depend on magnitudes of t and k, it should be equal
to zero, and its solution, as well as above, can be expressed through δ-function
depending on t and k:

RE(t|k) = f (t|k) δ(sin(kt)/t) = f (t|k) t δ(sin(kt)). (2.25)
Delta-function of periodic argument is represented by series: δ(sin x) =
∞
0 δ(x − πn), and consequently the solution of (2.21) can be written as
∞
RE(t|k) = π t2f (t|k)
1 δ(k − πn/t), (2.26)
in which, by virtue of the extra factor t in (2.25), there is no term with

P

P

n = 0.

From here follows that if the energy of system exceeds the value appropriate
to moment, the instant transfer of interaction is impossible, since it requires the
inﬁnite large moment!

The expression (2.26) corresponds, as though, to natural condition of reso-
nance transfer of the ideal retarded signal in any system with superﬂuous energy.
In the classical theory, with ﬁxed distance between emitter and receiver, it shows
that the interaction executes by integer numbers of half-waves.

Let’s consider (ω, r)-representation of the Equation (2.22). As it is identical
to (2.9) with replacements (t, k) → (ω, r) only, then by analogy with (2.12) it
must be written that

RN E(ω|r) = ϕ0(r)δ(ω) + ϕ1(r)δ′(ω) + ϕ2(r)δ′′(ω) + ϕ3(r)δ(ω − 4.5/r) + ...

(2.27)

or, in the temporary representation,
RN E(t|r) = f0(r) + t f1(r) + t2f2(r) + ... . (2.28)
Hence, at the lacking of energy concerning value of moment (it is just the
case of tunneling) the opportunity of instant transition at t = 0 is not excluded
and may be described by the function f0(r).

Here should be specially underlined, that this nonlocality does not lead to
nonlocality of E and H ﬁelds. Such conclusion follows from consideration of the
commutators of ﬁelds, as response functions must be expressed through Green
functions:

[Ei(x), Ej (y)] = [Hi(x), Hj (y)] = 1
[Ei(x), Hj(y)] = 1
and diﬀerentiation of response function removes the unique nonlocal term

4πi ∂t∂jD(x − y), (2.29)

4πi {∂i∂j − δij ∂2

t }D(x − y);

f0(r) in (2.28).

Thus, nonlocality should be observable basically in such phenomena as the
Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, the Casimir eﬀect, eﬀects of near ﬁeld optics, etc., caused
by the peculiarities of ﬁeld Aµ. Moreover, the possibility of movement with
superluminal speed is the pure quantum phenomenon, and therefore, in the
complete consent with the theory of relativity, cannot be described in the scope
of classical theory.

3. DURATION OF INTERACTION
3-1. DURATION OF STATE FORMATION AND PRINCIPLE

OF PASSIVITY

The Wigner’s causality admitted a negative ”durations of delay” τ > −a
and it was assumed that a can be the Compton wavelength. It seems natural to

7

suggest that for photons such estimation must be conformed to the uncertainty
principle and/or can be associated with an extent of near ﬁeld.

Let us consider this problem in detail. The complex function of duration
of interaction can be determined by expansion of R(ω) or its logarithm in the
vicinity of some characteristic frequency of medium ω0 as:

ln R(ω, r) = ln R(ω0, r) + i(ω − ω0) τ (ω0, r) + 1
with
τ (ω, r) ≡ τ 1 + iτ 2 = (∂/i∂ω) ln R(ω, r). (3.2)
In this representation τ 1(ω) is the time-delay during elastic scattering (e.g.
[25]) and τ 2(ω) is the duration of ﬁnal state formation, some of their peculiarities
are outlined in the Appendix.

2 (ω − ω0)2 τ ′(ω0, r) + ... (3.1)

The physical signiﬁcance of τ 2 becomes more transparent in its formulation
in the S-matrix theory as τ 2 = ∂ ln |S|/∂ω. Hence, τ 2 can be considered as
a measure of temporary non-completion of the ﬁnal (free photon) state: by
deﬁnition, S-matrix should be unitary while describing transition between real
physical states (cf. [26]).

If we shall restrict our consideration to ﬁrst two terms of (3.1), then since for
passive linear media |R(ω)|2 = |R(ω0)|2 exp[−2(ω − ω0)τ 2] ≤ 1, the inequality

(ω − ω0)τ 2(ω0, r) ≥ 0 (3.3)
should be valid, and, therefore, the formation time τ 2 < 0 under some

values of ω < ω0.

Thus, the advanced or instantaneous, in the sense of expression (1.1), phe-
nomena could be observed within a frequency range below the resonance one,
just in the correspondence with the Subsection 2-3.

In macroscopic theories the role of medium response function plays the
Fourier-transform of dielectric susceptibility, ε(ω, r). Possibility of the negative
sign of formation time in these theories is emerged from such general precept:
in passive media the principle of entropy growing results in the strict inequality:
∂(ωε(ω))/∂ω ≥ 0 [27 ]. At substitution R → ε(ω) − ε(∞) = ε1 + iε2 in (3.1)
this general inequality can be rewritten as
ε2
ε1 . (3.4)

τ 2 ≤ 1
Hence in the region of abnormal dispersion, where must be expected discor-

ω − τ 1

dance between maxima of τ 1 and τ 2, the value of τ 2 can be negative.

Temporal functions of the simplest form can be obtained in a model for

dielectric susceptibility of media with single isolated resonance:

Γ/2

ε(ω; r1, r2) = ρ(r1, r2)/[ω2
After substitution in the deﬁnition (3.2), this gives at |ω| ˜ ω0 >> Γ:

τ 1 =
̟2 + (Γ/2)2 ≈
δω2 + (Γ/2)2 ≈ 1
δω
τ 2 =
where δω = (ω0 − ω), ̟ = (ω0 + ω)/2.
Due to its conformity with the Breit-Wigner formulae the physical sense of
expression (3.6) is obvious. The expression for τ 2 is close to the uncertainty
value, evidently admits negative τ 2 and could be interpreted as advanced emis-
sion of photons or as their instantaneous jumps onto the distance c |τ 2|.
Making use of these expressions, the condition (3.4) transforms in

δω2 + (Γ/2)2 ; (3.6)

At the margin of resonant line, |δω| ≥ Γ/2, one can accept that
τ ef f ≡ τ 2 − 1
4 δω (δω2 + (Γ/2)2) . (3.9)
Thus, a negative duration of formation (the ”gain of time” at superluminal
jump) in gaseous media is possible only and only at ω < ω0, and it completely
conﬁrms results of Subsection 2-3 above (just such frequencies were used in the
quoted experiments). Moreover, the length of superluminal ”jump” exceeds the
atomic sizes, at c(τ 2 − 1
ω ) ˜ 10−8 , only if |δω| ≤ 1011, i.e. only within the
specially prepared media of a type described in [1-3].

3-2. QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS
The causal, Stueckelberg-Feynman, propagator Dc includes the space-like
part, nonvanishing beyond of light cone, i.e. contains the superluminal terms.
This peculiarity is usually intuitively understood as a result of vacuum ﬂuctua-
tions, descriptively interpreting through uncertainty principles.

2 D(1) ≡ 1

4π δ(c2t2 − r2) + 1

Really, the photon propagator of the lowest order is written as
Dc(t, r) = D + 1
where the ﬁrst term (the Pauli - Jordan function) is supported in the light
cone, but the second term (the Hadamard function) partially goes out the cone,
though with a fast attenuation in the outside region. Classical electrodynamics
is based on the retarded interaction or on the propagator D only [28] and does
not include superluminal terms.

c2t2 − r2 , (3.10)

2πi

In the general case, the ﬁrst term of the causal propagator is responsible for
the restriction of support of space-time parameters into the light cone, c2t2−r2 ≥
0, and the second one is responsible for the restriction of support of energy-
moments parameters: E2 − p2c2 ≥ m2c4. These requirements were considered
in the Section 2 from another point of view. Fulﬁllment of both requirements
by any single function is impossible; these two functions have diﬀerent physical
sense, which can conform to diﬀerent space-time eﬀects [22]. Therefore the
durations, resulting from these two parts, may have diﬀerent physical sense and
diﬀerent magnitudes.

In the (ω, k) representation at η → +0 the causal propagator of the lowest

order has in the Feynman gauge such form:

Thereby the delay time and duration of formation are:
τ 1(ω, k) = −2πδ(ω2 − k2), (3.12)
τ 2(ω, k) = 2ω
ω2 − k2 ˜
The function τ 1 obviously describes the reemission of dressed photon. The
function τ 2 shows that an outstripping is possible only at the condition of certain
mismatch between photon frequency and moment. Just such mismatch takes
place under conditions of the abnormal dispersion and frustrated total internal
reﬂection, when the absolute value of moment grows up.

In our case, the response function (transfer amplitude) consists of the photon
propagators and the vertex parts. It can be assumed that in the lowest order

9

the delay and duration times at each elementary step of photon transfer will be
determined by the propagators only.

4πr ei|ω|r;

D(1)(ω, r) = − 1

Let’s continue our examinations in the (ω, r)- representation:
Dc(ω, r) = − 1
2πir sin(ωr), (3.13)
and we receive by consideration the equation (B.1) such temporal functions:
τ c(ω, r) = r sgnω; (3.14)
τ (1)(ω, r) = −ir cot(ωr). (3.15)
The expression (3.14) shows that causal propagators describe free photons
propagations in wave zone and it means that the usual QED calculations prac-
tically exclude phenomena connected with near ﬁelds.

The expression (3.15) reveals that response function tends to peaks as ωr →
2πn from below, i.e. at τ (1)
2 (ω, r) → −∞. Subsequent terms of the expansion
(3.1), as they are expressed through derivatives of τ (1), only sharpen these peaks
and therefore it can be concluded that the results of QED completely conﬁrm
our main condition (2.18).

3-3. TUNNELING
Tunnel transitions, as is known, are intimately related with the imaginary
values of momenta. As the demonstrative example of such phenomena the
tunnel transition of particle with energy E through the rectangular barrier U (x)
in the 1-D space range (−a, a), where E < U0, can be considered.

Energy of particle moving in the potential U (x) is equal to E = p2/2m +
U (x). For reaching the classically forbidden region, E < U , kinetic energy
should be negative, corresponding to imaginary momenta p. In the WKB ap-
x dx′p(x′)/¯h+
proximation the wave function ψ(x) ˜ exp(iΦ(x)) with Φ(x) = ±
1
2 is the local momentum. In the classical
O(¯h), where p(x) = [2m (U (x) − E)]
region, the wave function is oscillatory one, while in the classically forbidden re-
gion (corresponding to imaginary momenta) the wave function is exponentially
suppressed.

R

The matrix element of this transition is of order
[2m (U (x) − E)/¯h2]1/2dx, (3.16)

M ˜ exp(−

a

where a is determined from the equality U (±a) = E. This representation

leads to the following expression for time durations:

τ (E) = ¯h ∂

i∂E ln M = −Im
Z

a

−a

[2m (U (x) − E)/¯h2]−1/2dx, (3.17)

which can be rewritten via imaginary moment of tunneling particle. Here
can be noted that at the considering of tunnel processes by the Landau method
the transition to an ”imaginary” time is often employed, but as the formal
procedure only [29].

For a suﬃciently common case of the oscillator (parabolic) barrier U (x) =

U0 − 1

2 κ x2 the expression (3.17) leads to such results:

τ 2(E) = − π

τ 1(E) = 0;
with an oscillator frequency ω0 = (k/m)1/2, i.e. behind the barrier the
complete energy of particle (wave) must appear instantaneously and regardless

(3.18)

2ω0 = − λ0

4c

10

of its value, as τ 2 in (3.18) corresponds to λ/4c. This property is retained
even under energy absorption at the tunneling state, e.g. at substitution U0 →
U0 + U1 cos ωt, if U0 + U1 > E. Note that |ω0τ 2| is bigger than uncertainty
magnitude and hence can be measurable.

Independence from the energy does not represent the common property of
tunnel transitions. So for the rectangular barrier τ 2(E) = −[2m a2/(U − E)]1/2,
and here the advancing duration (extent of instant jump) varies with U (t).

The expression (3.17) really shows that the tunnel transition proceed without
delays as τ 1 = 0, but τ 2 is negative and in general qualitatively corresponds to
the uncertainty value. For E > U0, evidently, τ 1 6= 0 and both its signs are, in
principle, possible.

Let’s consider, as a more speciﬁc example, the variation of wave function in
this process by direct calculations. Let the process begins with the Gaussian
wave packet, centered around k1, on the left side of barrier

ψi(t, x) =

dk f (k − k1) exp[i(kx − E(k)t)], (3.19)

∞

Z

−∞

The usual calculation of function on the right side of barrier leads to
ψf (t, x) ∼= ψi(t, x − 2a), (3.21)
which shows that the transmission through barrier is instantaneous (unessen-

tial phase factors are omitted).

The strange, contradictory and curious, as seems, eﬀect of instantaneous
packet transfer is usually explained as erroneous, explicable by physical non-
completeness of nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation (e.g.
[14]). But as was
shown by diﬀerent methods, just similar instantaneous jumps are characteristic
for completely relativistic QED expressions. Hence may be concluded that the
possibilities of superluminal or even instant transitions are the characteristic
peculiarity of quantum tunneling.

3-4. FRUSTRATED TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION (FTIR)
For analysis of experiments [7] the basic peculiarities of phenomenon of FTIR
must be considered. As FTIR can be described classically, we can begin the
consideration with the Fresnel formulas. In accordance with them amplitudes
of evanescent waves, tunneling into optically lesser dense medium under the
angle ϑ ≥ sin−1(1/n), and amplitudes of appropriate usual waves in (x, z) plane
are connected on the borderline z = 0 by the response function [30]:
Se(ω|t, x, z) = A(n, ϑ) exp[−iω(t − x n sin ϑ) − ω s z], (3.22)
where s = (n2 sin2 ϑ − 1)1/2, n > 1, factor A(n, ϑ) depends on polarization,

etc.

∞

The condition of completeness of (3.22) should be expressed as

|Se|2dz = 1, (3.23)

0

Z
which shows that in the description of FTIR must be included all trajectories
of evanescent ”rays” with z ∈ [0, ∞). But if durations of their passage depend
on z, the short initial wave pulse should be eﬀectively extended after each act of
FTIR. However, already the waveguides practice shows absence of appreciable
expansion of short pulses [31] (just absence of an expansion is the basic one for

11

single mode light guides). Therefore it should be assumed, that the durations
of ”geometrically diﬀering trajectories of rays” do not depend on z and these
durations should be (approximately, at least) equal, i.e. the transverse shifts
of ”trajectories” of evanescent rays must be instant: the duration of signal
propagation in x direction in the area of FTIR should been determined by the
speed component vx = (c/n) sin ϑ only.

The direct analogy to the consideration carried out above permits to rewrite
(3.22) as Se(ω; r) = |Se| exp(iΦ) with the real phase Φ(ω, r) and then, according
to (3.2),

τ 1 = ∂Φ/∂ω = −(t − n x sin ϑ), (3.24)
s n sin2 ϑ ∂n
τ 2 = ∂
Hence the response function for transparent linear medium and weak light

∂ω ln |Se| = −z[s + ω

∂ω ]. (3.24’)

ﬂux can be written down at |ω| ˜ ω0 as

S(ω, r) = S(ω0, r) exp{(ω − ω0)[i τ 1(ω0, r) − τ 2(ω0, r)]}. (3.25)
On the other hand, we can begin with (3.25) as with the independent deter-
mination of response function. Then according to [32] the changes of moment of
particle during quantum transition is determined as ∆p = ρ hEi V Tp, where ρ
is the average density of charges in volume of interaction V , hEi is the average
intensity of an internal ﬁeld, Tp is the duration of process. At FTIR the mag-
nitude and direction of additional moment, received by photon in the area of
FTIR, should be determined by parameters of ﬁeld E in immediate proximity
to media interface layer. And actually this formula conducts to the condition,
described above: the performance of (3.22) corresponds to the transformation
of moment, kz → ikz, and (3.25) corresponds to the representation of complex
temporal function Tp → τ 1 + iτ 2, which at τ 1 = 0 leads to concordance of both
approaches.

Note that on the same basis some other phenomena, analogs of FTIR, can

be considered (their description is given e.g. in [33]).

4. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS
The cited experiments, except FTIR, can be divided onto two groups: 1).
The resonant ones, in which ”gain time” can be, in principle, measurable after
single scattering act, and 2). Nonresonant (relative to atomic frequencies) pro-
cesses of light ﬂux passage through media, where tiny ”gain” durations can be
accumulated via sequential interactions.

1). The best demonstration of existence of superluminal propagation is pre-
sented in the articles [2]: the weak almost resonant laser pulse of λ = 0.8521
mcm was passed through tube of 6 cm length with atomic Cesium at tempera-
ture of 300C. At the deviation of frequency from resonance into the abnormal
dispersion side on ∆ν = 1.9 MHz the light pulse, propagated through tube,
outstrips light pulse, transferred through vacuum, on (62 ± 1) nsec, which can
be named ”the gain time”.

The estimation of free path length and almost complete similarity of the
forms of input and output pulses show, that the pulse has undergone only one act
of outstripping scattering in tube. In support of this assumption can be noted
that the output signal is of order 40% of an entrance signal that corresponds

12

to division of an entrance pulse in each scattering act on approximately equal
retarding and advancing parts. As the width of top level Γ = 0.37 · 108 sec−1
[20], the estimation of advancing by the formula (3.12) conducts to the ”gain
duration” τ ef f ˜ τ 2 − 1/ω ˜ −59.4 nsec in the consent with measured value of
advancing or outstripping.

The experiments [3] are of special interest to suggested theory.

In them
the superluminal features of pulses propagated through microcavity containing
a few cold atoms of 85Rb were observed. Number of atoms was varied and, in
principle, the results could be extrapolated till single atom in the resonator. The
observations of superluminal propagation in such ”substance” evidently prove
that this phenomenon is not caused by rearrangement of wave front [11-13] and
so on, but it must be related to processes of scattering on individual atoms.

The numerical treatment of these experiments show that with detuning of
initial laser frequency on 53 MHz the advancing of signal on 170 nsec is observed,
but with detuning on 45 MHz it gave way to delay on the 440 nsec. It means that
the strict resonance is above the frequency of superluminal signal not more than
on 8 MHz. On the other hand the observed outstrip on 170 nsec corresponds, in
accordance with (2.12), to diﬀerence of frequencies of order of 5.88 MHz from
resonance into the region of abnormal dispersion.

Hence we should conclude the conformity of these experimental data with

suggested theory.

Now let consider the ﬁrst, as far as we know, observation of the superluminal
phenomenon [1]. In this experiment it was established that the pulse of He-Ne
laser (λ = 0.6328 mcm) passes through a tube with 20Ne (p = 2.6 Torr, L = 16
cm) with the group velocity u = 1.0003c.

Let’s try to be limited by consideration of this experiment to account of
the closest resonance on λ21 = 0.6334 mcm with A21 = 1.36 · 107 sec−1 only.
Density of atoms in the pipe with such pressure of gas is of order Na =
9.2 · 1016 atoms/cm3 (i.e. Ne ˜ 8Na electrons of upper atomic shell con-
sidered as scatterers). The cross-section of unbiased elastic scattering σ =
ω )2|τ ef f | ≈ 3 · 10−20 cm2. Hence the free path length
16π
l = 1/Neσ = 45 cm and each photon cannot suﬀer more than one scatter-
ing act. Thereby the ”gain duration” should be calculated for single atoms:
as the diﬀerence of frequencies is of order of 453 GHz, it leads, in accordance
with (3.12), to the advancing on 0.35 psec. These values gives u/c ˜ 1.0006,
qualitatively corresponding to the results of [1].

2). Let’s consider the experiments, in which the superluminal phenomena
in nonresonant (relative to atomic levels) conditions were observed. For such
cases all photons can be divided on ”superluminal” and usual ones. For ”super-
luminal” photons, which have experienced consecutive outstripping (advanced)
interactions only, the average number of such interactions on distance L will be
of order N = L/(l + ∆l), where l = 1/ρσ is the free path length, ρ is the density
of scatterers, σ is the complete cross-section of e-γ scattering and ∆l = c|τ 2| for
τ 2 < 0. Therefore, the durations of light ﬂux ﬂight through vacuum and su-
perluminal photons ﬂight and jumps through medium are equal, accordingly,

13

to

tons:

T = L/c;
It results in an obvious expression for average speed of ”superluminal” pho-

Tadv = (L − N ∆l)/c → T − ∆T . (4.1)

u/c = T /Tadv = 1/(1 − cρσ|τ 2|). (4.2)
In the experiments [5] superluminal propagation of pulse of intensity 3 ÷ 100
W/cm2 through the ﬁlm of GaP:N with changes of thickness of ﬁlm in an inter-
val 9.5 ÷ 76 mcm was investigated with variation of the laser radiation frequency
around the isolated A-line (534 nm). The received diagram of dependence of
duration of delay (positive and negative) as function of frequency of light qual-
itatively corresponds to the expression (3.4) with the dramatic transition from
subluminal to superluminal speeds.

In the series of experiments [6] passage of light pulse through multilayer
dielectric mirrors was investigated. The mirrors contained alternating layers of
thickness λ/4 with high (H) and low (L) indices of refraction, so they were of
structure (HL)mH, in whole were investigated mirrors with m = 3 ÷ 11.

From the classical point of view each pair of layers should completely reﬂect
falling resonant wave. But as some photons are passed, due tiny superluminal
jumps, for those times on larger distances, they slip through interferential reﬂect-
ing planes. Here can be accepted that as at nonresonant scattering two Feynman
graphs (retarded and advanced) lead to approximately equal contributions, so
each pair of layers approximately halves passed photon ﬂux into reﬂected and
transmitted parts. Therefore, if the photon free path length l < λ/4, intensity
of light, missed through such mirror, should contain an outstripping ﬂow of
intensity Jadv(m) ˜ J0/2m that corresponds to measurements.

As the examined process is nonresonant, then according to principle of un-
certainty or (3.4), where far from all self frequencies the second term can be
omitted, we accept that τ 2 = −1/2ω, and it means, that the process of scat-
tering occurs on almost free electrons. In the same approximation, according
to the optical theorem of scattering theory, complete cross-section of interac-
tion σtot = (4πc/ω) r0, r0 = e2/mc2. Thus at density of external electrons
ρ = 1.3 · 1021 cm−3, the relation (4.2) conducts to u/c = 1.56, that corresponds
to the experimental data.

The experiments in the microwave range [4] are more diﬃcult for analyzing,
as in them the role of boundary conditions can be essential. Thereby we shall
limit ourselves by qualitative consideration of superluminal propagation noticed
at pass of GHz waves by air between two aerials. If such process can be described
by instantaneous jump of wave on ∆l (outstripping radiation) at distance x
between megaphones or aerials, it becomes necessary to expect change of relative
speed as u/c = 1/[1 − ∆l/x] and analogical dependence was observed in these
experiments.

It is necessary to notice, that the independence of all these eﬀects on polar-
ization is caused, obviously, by absence of conductors on the way of light ﬂuxes.
The interesting qualitative results are submitted in [8], where was investigated
the diﬀraction of THz waves on thin wires and plates and was received, that
the superluminal phenomena are appreciable at polarization parallel to conduc-

14

tors and are absent or are not appreciable at perpendicular polarization. These
results seem explainable, as waves of parallel polarization should generate an
alternating current in a long conductor, which thereby becomes the radiating
aerial with the extended near ﬁeld zone. In case of perpendicular polarization
the induction is much weaker and diﬀracted beams of far ﬁeld are imposed on
weak radiation of near ﬁeld.

Let discuss the experiments on FTIR.
In the experiments [7 a)] ”gain duration” (3.24’) in the area of FTIR was
measured in THz region: the distribution of wave packages with central wave
length of 1 mm and pulse duration of 0.8 psec was investigated at depths of FTIR
from 0 up to 8 mm. The researches showed outstripping character of evanescent
waves, the numerical estimation of this advancing, obviously, linearly depends
on the size of an interval, in which these waves are observed. According to
(3.24’) and if omit the term ∂n/∂ω, the observed data conducted to τ 2 = −0.41
psec on 1 mm of depth of evanescent waves penetration.

In the experiments [7 b)] dependences of outstripping of evanescent waves on
depth d was measured at various light polarizations (λ = 3.39 mcm, d = 0 ÷ 25
mcm) and it has been shown, that the duration of an advancing does not depend
on polarization. Up to distance d = 8 mcm it grows and then remains approxi-
mately constant, of order of 0.2 psec. These supervisions do not contradict our
approach, but do not give opportunities of quantitative comparison.

5. DISCUSSION
As the opportunity of instantaneous propagation of signal (or excitation)
within a near ﬁeld zone, its transferring, is established and as it is demonstrated
that by this phenomenon can be explained a set of experimental facts, connected
with ”gain times”, then now the attempts to consider the problem with more
general positions become possible.

Let’s examine some theoretical prerequisites and possibilities for interpreta-

tion of the deduced results.

1. It is necessary to emphasize, at the beginning, that the principle of locality
experimentally was checked up only in the far ﬁeld, only for ﬁelds E and H.
Hence, the a priori excluding of possibilities of nonlocality of those parts of
electromagnetic ﬁeld, which are not included into the (transverse) far electrical
and magnetic ﬁelds, represents not obvious hypothesis.

The hidden opportunity of nonlocality ”in small” can be contained in con-
ditions of gauge invariance: the classical Lorentz condition, ∂Aµ/∂xµ = 0, is
replaced in QED by the Lorentz - Fermi condition [34]:

|0i = 0, (5.1)

∂Aµ
∂xµ
which requires a mutual indemniﬁcation or disappearance of the ”superﬂu-
ous” components of Aµ, ”pseudophotons”, only in the average. Therefore it does
not exclude possible nonlocality of interaction in a near zone of these ﬁelds.

All attempts of ﬁelds’ quantization without introduction of 4-vector Aµ
were unsuccessful. Then the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect brightly showed, that these
”needless” ﬁeld components have deﬁnite physical sense and the impossibil-

15

ity of their omitting has, apparently, deep roots. This conclusion could be
strengthened by existence and features of Casimir forces and, probably, by the
phenomena of near ﬁeld optics (e.g. the review [35]).

It can be added also, that consideration of some concrete phenomena con-
[36]) leads to phe-
nected to longitudinal part of electromagnetic ﬁeld (cf.
nomenological introduction of nonlocality, of some eﬀective ”smearing” of charge,
depending on its 4-moment.

So, the problem of locality of these components of ﬁeld is not resolved yet.
2. The consideration of all these phenomena invites further investigations of

the basic equations of theory. So, if to examine the Klein-Gordon equation

t − ∆ − m2] f (x) = 0, (5.2)

[∂2
as the wave equation, i.e. to search its solution as
f (x) = f (vt − r), (5.3)
then non-fading decision exists only at v ≤ c. Just this circumstance forbids
movement with superluminal speed as eﬀective nonlocality on any distances.
However there is not formal restriction on the existence of non-wave solutions
in a scope of near ﬁeld with arbitrary value of v. So it is necessary to consider
such solutions, which can transfer interaction via ﬁeld Aµ with speed greater c
on small distances, i.e. eﬀectively nonlocal.

3. Let’s point out such formal opportunity of interpretation of the equa-
tions describing processes faster-than-c. Projectors in (3.6-7) can be expressed
through the Green functions for Klein-Gordon equation with imaginary mass:
for example,

PN E(ω, k) = θ(−k2) =

dm2 δ(−ω2+k2−m2) = 2

dm2∆1(ω, k, im),

∞

Z

0

∞

Z

(5.4)

i.e.

it formally describes interaction transferred by tachyons, hypothetical
particles with velocity always-bigger c. From here for (3.7) in the complete
x-representation follows such dispersion relation:

fN E(x) = 2π

dm2

d4y ∆1(x − y, im) fN E(y). (5.5)

∞

Z

0

Z

For functions fE(x) is received the same representation, but with real mass.
Thus, it is not excluded a formal possibility for description the superluminal

phenomena via tachyons (cf. [37]).

4. At transition to imaginary time, e.g. at transformation of variables
(t, r) → (iτ 2, r) at τ 1 = 0, the Equation (5.2) transforms from hyperbolic into
elliptic one, in the 4-D Poisson equation:
τ + ∇2] Dc(iτ , r) = −δ(x), (5.6)

[∂2
and hence, all signals in such ﬁeld are transferred instantly: the ﬁeld becomes
instanton ones (cf.
[38]). It means that the photon, absorbed on one side of
such pseudoparticle of radius ∆l = c|τ 2|, instantly appears on the opposite side.
Thus instead discussion of the advanced character of emission, instantaneous
jumps and so on, we can take into account the existence of virtual instanton-
type states (of zero mass in considered case) with parameters speciﬁed by the
usual propagators via time duration terms.

Such description seems suﬃciently simple and physically reasonable.

16

But a somewhat more complicated will be the structure of near ﬁeld in
the FTIR phenomenon. Its description by the substitution kz → ikz into the
Fresnel formulae leads to replacement of the usual ansatz Qn(k) = k2
0 − n2k2
for the far ﬁeld on ansatz Qe(k) = k2
0 + n2(k2
y) for the FTIR zone. It
means transition from the wave (hyperbolic) equation into the ultrahyperbolic
equation [39] for near-surface evanescent waves:

x − k2

z − k2

L(ix) Se ≡ (∂2
This equation can be considered as the diﬀerence of two 2-D Laplace equa-

y ) Se = ± δ(x). (5.7)

t + ∂2

x − ∂2

z − ∂2

tions (∆t,z − ∆x,y) f (x) = δ(x) with Green functions (propagators)
G±(x) = 1/(L(x) ± i0) ≡ 1/(t2 + z2 − x2 − y2 ± i0). (5.8)
Their diﬀerence should been the Green function of corresponding homoge-
neous equation. However, as the full Fourier-transforms Fk[G±(x)] = 4π/(−G(k)±
i0) of both functions (5.8) coincide, the homogeneous form of equation (5.7) has
only the zero general solution. It means the absence of free waves, which would
propagate in z-direction. On the other hand, it means that the x-component
of light ﬂux speed at FTIR depends on kx component of moment only, and for
this reason, as was noted above, light pulses at FTIR are not widening.

However, for complete reliance in their existence the further researches are

necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
The received results demonstrate, in accordance with the experimental data,
the reality of superluminal signal transferring. Hence they prove the validity
of Wigner’s general principle of causality with its admitting of instantaneous
transferring. It seems that these reasonings can be considered as the ﬁrst proof of
existence of instantons as virtual particles or, more precisely, as pseudoparticles.
The principle of causality is reﬁned, and it is shown that ”sizes of scatterers”
or ”sizes of scattering processes”, often introduced in diﬀerent investigations,
can be identiﬁed, at least in deﬁnite cases, with the instanton sizes. It is not
excluded that just such instantaneous transferring can take place at transfer
of excitations or even binding energy between some constituents of condensed
media (the F¨orster law and so on). Hence some of their parameters can be
deﬁned by the extent of area of tunneling (probably, in the scope of near ﬁeld).
All it shows the necessity of (formal) reﬁnement of the ﬁrst postulate of
relativity: the speed of signal propagation in far ﬁeld cannot exceed the vacuum
velocity of light, but the transferability of excitation can be instantaneous on
the length of tunneling (within the scope of near ﬁeld). From the kinematical
point of view such transitions can be described via magnitudes of ”gain time”
at processes of particle (wave) propagation. Note that the physical sense, as
was discussed above, reveals that the expression ”superluminal transferring” is
more exact and preferable than the usual now ”superluminal propagation” and
so on.

It can be pointed also, that the physical sense of instantaneous character
of transition consists, in particular, in the answer on very old naive question:
where resides particle at the time of tunnel transition? And also: how can be

17

imaged a process of gradually exit of emitting wave (on its length, at least) from
the source?

On the other hand, it must be underlined that in the chain of these inves-
tigations had been demonstrated the signiﬁcance and possibilities of theory of
temporal functions, at least in their speciﬁc forms. Moreover, it must be noted
the suggesting and developing of the speciﬁc mathematical method of equations
of orthogonality, which will be more comprehensively considered elsewhere.

APPENDIX
A. CONDITIONS OF COMPLETENESS AND EQUATIONS OF

ORTHOGONALITY

The most serious assumption at deduction of conditions of orthogonality
(2.3-4) and others consists in essentially used classical condition of completeness:

PL + PN L = 1, (A.1)
Really it means an implicit introduction of the assumption about absence of
features connected to intersection of areas, PL
PN L = 0, and requires special
researches. Notice that the Heaviside unit functions θ(ξ), from which projectors
are constructing, are not deﬁnite in the point ξ = 0; the considered problem,
just as many others in the theory, is intimately connected with this uncertainty.

T

The decomposition (A.1) can be generalized as
PL + PN L + PδL = 1, (A.2)
into which are introduced the ”quasilocal terms” (cf. [40]):
PδL = a0δ(x2) + a1∂2
µδ(x2) + ... . (A.3)
At limiting by the ﬁrst term of (A.3) and as in the (t, k)-representation the
2π2k sin(k|t|), we receive that the argument of

Fourier transform Fk[δ(x2)] = 1
δ-function in (2.11) is replaced on

cos(kt)
2π2k3 [(1 + a0k2) tan(kt) − kt] (A.4)
and consequently the transcendental equation, which roots determine prop-

erties of nonlocal functions, is slightly varied.

However, insofar our main result, the conclusions about instantaneous ex-
citation transferring by tunneling, does not change, we can do no more than
mention a possibility of consideration of quasilocal terms in decomposition of
projectors and accordingly in decomposition of response functions.

B. TO INTRODUCTION AND DETERMINATION OF TEM-
The designation (3.2) can be rewritten as the

PORAL FUNCTIONS
equation for S-matrix:

(∂/i∂ω) S(ω, r) = τ (ω, r) S(ω, r). (B.1)

18

Logically another way seems more reasonable: the transition to such equa-
tion by the complete Legendre transformation (t, r) → (ω, k) of the Schr¨odinger
equation for S-matrix:

(i∂/∂t) S(t, r) = H(t, r) S(t, r), (B.2)
This way leads, instead of (B.1), to somewhat diﬀerent form:
(∂/i∂ω) S(ω, k) = T(ω, k) S(ω, k) (B.3)
with temporal function instead of Hamiltonian.
It should be noticed that just these functions arise into theory in the quite
reasonable way: they are naturally revealed in the standard QED calculations
[41]. That is the reason that we did not discuss here many other suggested
forms of time-delays, e.g. [42].

Fourier transformation of (B.1),
(∂/i∂ω) S(ω, k) =
shows that both deﬁnitions are rather close if it can be suggested that the
main role in discussed processes play closely related magnitudes of wave num-

It must be noted that the ﬁrst approaches and views on the problem re-
quire, in accordance with a common intuition, consideration of their relation
to the uncertainties principles. Therefore must be considered peculiarities of
uncertainty principle, connected with temporal functions [43].

Let’s use the general method of deduction of uncertainties relations given
by Schr¨odinger [44]. It starts with decomposition of the product of operators
on Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts as AB = 1
2 (AB − BA)
with subsequent quadrates of this expression, its averaging over the complete
system of ψ-functions and replacement of operators by diﬀerences of opera-
tors and their averaged values: A → A− hAi. This leads, due the Schwartz
inequality, to such ﬁnal expression:

2 (AB + BA) + 1

4 | hAB − BAi |2 + 1

(∆A)2(∆B)2 ≥ 1
where to the common form became added the last term, which is an Hermi-
tian function and its magnitude must be real. Note that the Heisenberg limit
of (B.5) shows a minimal value of uncertainties, which can be achieved at the
determined conditions.

4 ( hAB + BAi − 2 hAi hBi )2, (B.5)

In considered case the canonically conjugated operators must be substituted
by diﬀerences A → E− hEi and B → T− hTi and there is needed their averag-
ing, instead of ψ-functions, over the complete system of S(E) functions, nonuni-
tary in general, as

hAi =

dE S∗AS /

dE |S|2. (B.6)

The evident calculations in E-representation with operators T and E give

such result:

4 ¯h2 + 1

(∆E)2(∆T )2 ≥ 1
4 (hEτ 1i − 2 hEi hτ 1i)2, (B.7)
i.e. the general form of uncertainty principle does not depend on the duration
of state formation or on the ”gain time” at jumps, if τ 2 is negative. It can means
that peculiarity of τ 2 must be considered as the internal property of forming
particle, which does not depend on measurement procedures.

[13]. In the most part of these and other analogical theoretical models are
examined problems of rearrangement of wave fronts by interference eﬀects and
possibilities of comparison of those models with relativistic causality. Such
ideas are not compatible with the observations [3], and as we will arrive at
another conclusions, we cannot compare our results with these models. On the
other hand their complete critical examination is far from our purposes, the
possibilities of tachyon nature of these eﬀects are discussed below.

It is shown that the transparency of opaque material with negative permittivity exhibits resonant
behavior. The resonance occurs as a result of the excitation of the surface waves at slab bound-
aries. Dramatic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation of the incident evanescent ﬁelds at the resonance improves the
resolution of the the sub-wavelength imaging system (superlens). A ﬁnite thickness slab can be
totally transparent to a p-polarized obliquely incident electromagnetic wave for certain values of the
incidence angle and wave frequency corresponding to the excitation of the surface modes. At the
resonance, two evanescent waves have a ﬁnite phase shift providing non-zero energy ﬂux through
the non-transparent region.

INTRODUCTION

Propagation of the electromagnetic radiation in ma-
terials with negative dielectric permittivity (permeabil-
ity) or the so called left-handed materials (LHM) has at-
tracted great deal of attention in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4].
The increased interest in properties of such media has
been driven by their potential applications in various
branches of science and technology. One possible ap-
plication is related to the possibility of creating the so
called superlens: a subwavelength optical imaging sys-
tem without the diﬀraction limit [4, 5, 6, 7]. The su-
perlens phenomenon is essentially based on ampliﬁca-
tion of evanescent waves, facilitated by the excitation
of the surface plasmons [6]. Plasma with overcritical
density is a simplest example of the negative ǫ mate-
p/ω2 < 0 for ω < ωp. Phenomena that
ω2
rial; ǫ = 1
take place in such plasmas are important in a number
of areas, in particular for the inertial conﬁnement fusion
(ICF) experiments [1, 8, 9].

In this work we show that the ampliﬁcation of the
evanescent waves originating from the interaction of two
evanescent ﬁelds (decaying and growing in space) has a
resonant character related to the excitation of surface
modes. Such ampliﬁcation of the evanescent ﬁeld al-
lows the penetration of the electromagnetic radiation to
depths much greater compared to the incident light wave
length[2]. The evanescent wave incident on the nega-
tive ǫ slab is strongly ampliﬁed when the resonant con-
ditions for the surface modes are met. For materials
1 the resonance occurs for ﬁnite values of
with ǫ
the wave vector ky (for ǫ =
1, the resonance occurs for
), where ky is the in-plane wave vector com-

ponent (p-polarization is considered). The presence of
resonances with ﬁnite values of the in-plane wave vector
ky may signiﬁcantly improve the overall resolution of the
subwavelength imaging system.

ω/c)[2, 11]. In this case, the resonant excitation of sur-
face modes by the incident light can be achieved via the
presence of a single transition layer with 0 < ǫ < 1 on one
side of the slab with ǫ < 0[11]. The superposition of two
evanescent waves provides a ﬁnite energy ﬂux through the
region with ǫ < 0, which is equal to that in the incident
electromagnetic wave. The radiation is then re-emitted
at the other side of the opaque slab.

INTERFERENCE OF THE EVANESCENT

WAVES AND EFFECT OF SUPERLENSING

Non-propagating (evanescent) modes are basic solu-
tions to the Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic
ﬁelds in materials with negative dielectric permittivity.
Often such modes have been neglected assuming that the
boundary conditions in an inﬁnite medium preclude the
exponentially growing modes while the decaying modes
It has recently
do not contribute to the transmission.
been noted however [6] that in a slab of material with neg-
ative permittivity both (growing and decaying) compo-
nents are present, resulting in ampliﬁcation of the evanes-
cent modes. As shown by Pendry [6], the eﬀect of ampli-
ﬁcation of the evanescent spectrum of the incident light
(originating from the object) by ”negative” materials can
be advantageously used for subwavelength imaging appli-
cations, potentially leading to optical system without the
diﬀraction limit or superlens.

The imaging problem can be described in terms of the
optical transfer function τ (x, ky, ω) (ky designates the in-
plane wave vector directed along the surface of the mate-
rial), deﬁned as the ratio of Fourier components of image
img(x)/Bky
ﬁeld to object ﬁeld, Bky
)
∞
at a given imaging plane x. The transfer function can be
found by considering a p -polarized wave (electric vec-
tor in the plane of incidence) incident from vacuum on
a thin overcritical density slab of thickness d, dielectric
permittivity ǫ < 0 and magnetic permeability µ = 1 as
shown in Figure 1. The optical properties of this slab
are obtained by taking the ratio of the ﬁeld in the region

x > a + d to that at the object plane (in current calcu-
lations the object plane is assumed to be at x = 0). The
electromagnetic ﬁelds in each region of interest are found
from solving the well known wave equation,

to a coupled surface wave running on opposite sides of the

where x is a distance between the source and the image
planes and k0 = ω/c. Figure 2 shows the absolute value
of the optical transfer function at a distance x = 2d from
the source. As one can see, there are in general two sharp
peaks in the transfer function occurring for certain reso-
nant values of the in-plane wave vector ky > ω/c where
the spectrum is completely evanescent. The peaks cor-
respond to the resonant excitation of surface plasmons
that are supported by the interface between the thin
overcritical density medium and vacuum. This means
that only those ﬁelds for which ky > ω/c may resonantly
couple to this particular surface mode and get dramat-
ically ampliﬁed through constructive interference (these
are the spectral components that carry sub-diﬀraction-
limited resolution of the object). In fact, the zeros of the
denominator in Eq. 3

Ξ(d, ky, k0) + Λ(d, ky, k0) = 0

deﬁne the dispersion relation for the plasma surface
eigenmode that is supported by the thin overdense
medium. The above equation can be reduced to the fol-
lowing form:

which is the well known dispersion relation for surface
plasmons on an overdense medium-vacuum interface. It
is worth noting here that the transfer function given by
expression 3 is exact and no approximations were used
in its derivation. It includes the resonant contribution of
surface modes with a ﬁnite in-plane wave vector ky and
in the limit ǫ
>> ω/c it is reduced to that
obtained in Ref. [7] where the authors investigated the
resolution limit of the slab of ”negative” material with
dielectric permittivity ǫ =
and magnetic perme-
ability µ =
. It should also be noted that the
location (in ky wave vector space) of the two resonances
not only depends on the absolute value of the dielectric
constant ǫ but also the thickness of the slab d. For a
very thin slab, the two resonances are separated (smaller
slab thicknesses result in greater peak separation in ky
space). As the slab thickness increases, the two resonant
points move toward each other, eventually merging to-
gether forming a single peak. All of these features in the
transfer function have not been noticed in the previous
investigations since the authors limited their calculations
to the asymptotic case ky >> ω/c and kyd > 1. As we
will see below, the presence of such resonances may ad-
vantageously be used in the design of superlens for im-
proved image resolution and intensity.

The transfer function τ can be used to ﬁnd the recon-

structed ﬁeld in the image plane in the form

Bimg(x, y, t) =

S(ky)τ (x, ky, k0)ei(kyy−ωt)dky,

(6)

< ky <

where S(ky) is the wave vector spectrum of the source
(imaged object). Thus, the ability of the system to im-
age the object is completely determined by the optical
transfer function (3), which in itself depends on many
system’s physical parameters. In an ideal case, the trans-
fer function should transfer all spatial harmonics equally
or τ (x, ky , k0) = 1 for
. In reality how-
ever, the transfer function is a non-monotonous function
of the wave vector ky, medium material type deﬁned by
ǫ, its thickness d, and the position x of the imaging plane
relative to the position of the object plane. The super-
lensing can only be realized for certain set of the above
parameters. Figure 3 shows the optical transfer function
for two layers of materials with dielectric permittivities
ǫ1 =
1.0292+0.001i at the imaging
plane x = 2d. As one can see the transmission band (in
the wave vector space) is signiﬁcantly broadened in the
second material (ǫ =
1.0292 + 0.001i) due to the reso-
nant excitation of a surface plasmon with a ﬁnite value of
4. Such surface plasma wave is not

Let us estimate how well we can image an object using
these two materials. For a sake of simplicity we assume
that our object is represented by two slits of a certain
width located at a given distance away from each other
as shown in Figure 4. Substituting the Fourier trans-
form of the object together with the transfer function (3)
into Eq. 6 we arrive at the reconstructed image shown in
Figure 5 for the case when the incident light wavelength
is λ = 350 nm. As one can see, both materials pro-
vided considerable focusing, yielding the sub-wavelength
resolution of the object. However, as we expected the
image resolution and its intensity for the second layer
1.0292) is superior to that using material with
(ǫ =
ǫ =
1. This suggests that there is a range of sys-
tem parameters for which a signiﬁcant focusing can be
achieved[4] necessitating a further parametric study in
order to understand the relation between diﬀerent phys-
ical parameters of the system.

III. SURFACE WAVE INDUCED TOTAL
TRANSPARENCY OF MATERIAL WITH
NEGATIVE PERMITTIVITY

Surface wave induced ampliﬁcation of incident elec-
tromagnetic waves with spectral components of in-plane
ky
wave vectors ky satisfying the condition
> ω/c has
|
been considered in the previous section.
It was shown
that the resonant ampliﬁcation occurs as a result of the
excitation of a surface wave. A slab of negative ǫ ma-
terial surrounded by vacuum supports such a surface
mode for which its phase velocity is always sub-luminal
or ω/ky < c. As a result, only those modes of the inci-
> ω/c have been ampliﬁed. It is
dent light for which
possible however to amplify the propagating modes with
< ω/c too, thus creating the conditions for the abso-
ky
|
lute transparency to the incident propagating wave. This
can be done by creating conditions for the excitation of
a surface mode with phase velocity greater than that of
the speed of light.

Consider p-polarized light obliquely incident from vac-
uum on a two-layer structure having dielectric permittiv-
ity distribution shown in Fig. 6. Such a system can be
formed by placing an undercritical density plasma layer
(with thickness d and electron density corresponding to
the plasma frequency ωp,1) to an overcritical density
plasma layer (with thickness a and electron density cor-
responding to the plasma frequency ωp,2). The plasma-
plasma interface supports a surface wave with disper-
sion relation found from the solution to the Maxwell’s
equations[1],

in the region where ǫ < 0 and ky is normalized to the
classical skin depth δ = c/ωp,2.
It can be easily seen
that the phase velocity of the surface wave on a plasma-
plasma interface can be greater than that of light, so that
they can couple to radiating electromagnetic ﬁelds. This
means that the incident p-polarized electromagnetic wave
may excite a surface mode on a plasma-plasma interface
if the resonant condition (external ﬁeld frequency and its
wave vector’s tangential component have to match those
that are determined from the dispersion relation for the
plasma surface wave) is satisﬁed. The optical properties
of this dual-layer system can be found from matching
the ﬁelds of the incident/reﬂected electromagnetic waves
with those of the surface wave at the three interfaces.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld in each region B = (0, 0, Bz)
is a solution to the wave equation 1 with general solu-
tion given by expression 2. The electromagnetic ﬁelds in
d and x > a) represent a sum of
vacuum regions (x <
incident and reﬂected wave (x <
d), and a transmitted
wave (x > a). Matching solutions at diﬀerent boundaries
by requiring continuity of Bz and 1/ǫdBz/dx across inter-
faces, we obtain the unknown expansion coeﬃcients with
the transmission coeﬃcient having the following form,

where θ = arcsin[ky/k0]. Figure 7 shows the transmission
coeﬃcient as a function of the incidence angle. As one
can see there is a sharp increase in the transmission prop-
erties of the system when the angle of incidence matches
certain resonant value of θ at which point the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient reaches unity. The resonant value exactly
corresponds to that given by an expression (7) for the dis-
persion relation of the surface plasma wave. Thus, the
anomalous transmission occurs even for a system consist-
ing of an undercritical density plasma layer adjacent to an
overcritical density plasma slab, so that there is no need
to form a sandwich-like structure as argued in Refs. [2, 13]
in which a second surface plasma wave has to be excited
on the opposite side of the overcritical density layer to
achieve the same eﬀect. In other words, the anomalous
light transmission can be achieved through excitation of a
single surface plasma wave. The transmission coeﬃcient
is also a non-monotonous function of both plasma layer
thickness with a single maximum reached at certain cor-
related values determined from the interference condition
between evanescent ﬁelds in both plasma slabs.

IV. EVANESCENT WAVE INTERFERENCE
AND THE ENERGY TRANSPORT

It is often assumed that the evanescent waves do not
carry the energy. Therefore, in the problem of total trans-
parency of a layered structure there occurs a question of
how the energy is carried through the non-transparent
media where the only solutions are the evanescent modes.
One must remember however that the general solution in-
side the negative ǫ medium is a sum of two exponential
e−x (x
functions, one that decays with the distance
points in the propagation direction) and the other grows
ex. For the superposition of decaying and growing

may become ﬁnite when the combination A1A∗
2 has a ﬁ-
nite imaginary part, which requires a ﬁnite phase shift
between A1 and A2. Therefore, a ﬁnite energy ﬂux oc-
curs as a result of the superposition of two evanescent
modes with a ﬁnite phase shift . We shall call this the
interference of the evanescent modes.

It is easy to show that the required phase shift can
be obtained when two evanescent modes inside the neg-
ative ǫ region are matched to the outgoing (transmitted)

4

wave in vacuum. Matching of the evanescent solutions
with the incident vacuum wave (at the other side of the
negative ǫ region) shows that the total transmission may
be obtained only when the transition layer with ǫ > 0 is
included[11]. The condition of the absolute transparency
is equivalent to the resonant condition for the excita-
tion of the surface plasma mode. At the resonance the
Poynting ﬂux inside the slab becomes equal to that of the
incident radiation and the opaque plasma slab becomes
absolutely transparent. This can be a possible mecha-
nism of the anomalously high transparency of overdense
plasma recently observed in the experiment[10].

V. SUMMARY

In conclusion, we have shown that the excitation of
surface modes leads to the resonant transparency of opti-
cally opaque materials. Presence of such resonances may
improve the resolution and the signal intensity of the sub
wavelength imaging system. It has been also shown that
the resonant excitation of surface modes is an underly-
ing mechanism behind the total transparency of an over-
dence plasma slab to the incident electromagnetic wave.
The energy ﬂux through the negative ǫ region occurs as
a result of the interference of the evanescent modes.

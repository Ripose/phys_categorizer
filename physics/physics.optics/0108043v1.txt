We investigate the self-phase modulation of intense femtosecond laser pulses propagating in an
ionizing gas and its eﬀects on collective properties of high-order harmonics generated in the medium.
Plasmas produced in the medium are shown to induce a positive frequency chirp on the leading
edge of the propagating laser pulse, which subsequently drives high harmonics to become positively
chirped.
In certain parameter regimes, the plasma-induced positive chirp can help to generate
sharply peaked high harmonics, by compensating for the dynamically-induced negative chirp that
is caused by the steep intensity proﬁle of intense short laser pulses.

Recent remarkable progress in high-power femtosec-
ond laser technology has provided a novel opportunity to
investigate high-order harmonic generation processes in
an unprecedented high-intensity, ultrashort pulse regime.
While necessary for generating high-order harmonics
with wavelength extremely short compared to the laser
wavelength [1,2], the use of lasers in this regime has some
other important merits:
the harmonic conversion eﬃ-
ciency is dramatically enhanced [3,4], and the harmonic
pulse duration can be reduced to a subfemtosecond time
scale [5,6].

As the laser pulse evolves into the high-intensity, ul-
trashort regime, high harmonic emission begins to ex-
hibit complicated spectral features, such as harmonic line
broadening, blueshifting, splitting, and smearing [5–10].
All of these features are absent in the high harmonic spec-
tra observed for lasers with weak intensity well below
the ionization saturation intensity and long pulse dura-
tion (longer than a few hundred femtoseconds) that show
well-deﬁned narrow harmonic peaks almost exactly at
odd multiples of the fundamental laser frequency. The in-
volved spectral features showing up for intense short laser
pulses can be satisfactorily accounted for, at least at the
single-atom level, in terms of decomposition of high har-
monics into quantum-path components, and diﬀerent be-
haviors of the quantum-path components, in laser ﬁelds
with rapidly-varying instantaneous intensity [10–12].

Since high-intensity laser pulses can ionize atoms
producing plasmas that can aﬀect propagating waves,
a proper understanding of macroscopic high harmonic
the
structure necessitates a detailed knowledge of
plasma-related propagation eﬀect as well as the single-
atom eﬀect. It is known that an increase in electron den-
sity during the laser pulse duration causes the refractive
index of a medium to decrease with time, which leads to
frequency upshifting and spectral broadening of the laser
pulse [13–17]. Because the change in the driving laser
spectrum should be reﬂected in the harmonic conversion,

one might expect that harmonic spectral lines would like-
wise be blueshifted and broadened. In reality, however,
the harmonic spectrum exhibits behavior more compli-
cated than this expectation, as demonstrated in this pa-
per. As a matter of fact, there is another source that can
aﬀect the harmonic spectral line shape: the dynamically-
induced harmonic chirp (dynamic chirp) that is brought
about by a steep pulse envelope [11,18]. The observed
spectral behavior of high harmonics can only be under-
stood through inspecting the temporal variation of har-
monic frequency caused by the plasma-induced change in
the laser frequency, in close connection with the dynamic
chirp.

In this paper, we elucidate how the plasma eﬀect mod-
ulates the spectrum of an intense femtosecond laser pulse,
and discuss its subsequent inﬂuence and the eﬀect of laser
focusing on macroscopic high harmonic spectra.
It is
shown that the plasmas induce a positive frequency chirp
on the leading edge of the laser pulse up to the point at
which a maximum blueshift is attained, and a negative
chirp on the remaining part of the laser pulse. Depending
on the relative amount of the plasma-induced chirp com-
pared to the dynamic chirp, not only broadening but also
narrowing can occur in high harmonic spectral lines. We
demonstrate these using a one-dimensional (1D) model,
in which the atomic response to the laser is calculated
from the 1D Schr¨odinger equation, and propagations of
the laser and harmonic ﬁelds are considered in 1D space
along the propagation axis.

In order to see how the laser ﬁeld E1 is aﬀected by
the plasmas (whose eﬀects are dominated by electrons)
produced in the medium, we begin by ﬁnding a solution
of the 1D wave equation:

∂2E1(x, t)
∂x2

∂2E1
∂t2 =
where ωp(x, t) = ω0[Ne(x, t)/Ncr]1/2 is the local plasma
frequency, and ω0 is the laser frequency. The critical

plasma density Ncr is given in Gaussian units by Ncr =
meω2
0/4πe2, where me is the electron mass. To calcu-
late the electron density Ne(x, t), we use the ADK model
[19], and consider sequential tunneling ionization up to as
high stages of ionization as needed, neglecting collisional
ionization that is of little signiﬁcance in the parameter
regions in which high harmonic generation experiments
are commonly carried out. At the present gas pressures
(≤ 100 Torr) much lower than 1 atm, the energy loss and
temporal broadening of the laser are negligible [15]; thus,
we may ignore the amplitude modulation of the laser
ﬁeld. Assuming the Gaussian incident pulse E1(x, t) =
E0 exp [−(2 ln 2/∆t2)(t − x/c)2 − iw0(t − x/c)] that is a
solution to Eq. (1) in free space with ∆t being the full
width at half maximum (FWHM) of the pulse, we may
then write the solution of Eq. (1) in the medium as

E1(x, t) = E0 exp [−(2 ln 2/∆t2)(t − x/c)2 − iω0t

where n(x, t) = [1 − Ne(x, t)/Ncr]1/2 is the refractive in-
dex of the medium. This expression turns out to be a
good approximate solution of Eq. (1) under the condi-
x(∂n/∂t)dx′| ≪ 1, which
tions Ne/Ncr ≪ 1 and |c−1
are satisﬁed in the parameter regions considered in this
paper.

To conﬁrm that Eq. (2) indeed closely approximates
the exact solution, we present in Fig. 1 some typical spec-
tra of 30-fs laser pulses at the exit of the medium (Ne gas)
calculated from Eq. (2), along with those obtained from
direct numerical calculations of Eq. (1). Use of the ex-
plicit expression in Eq. (2) of course signiﬁcantly reduces
the computational time. Upon comparison, it is obvi-
ous that the approximate solutions presented in Fig. 1(a)
agree well with the exact numerical results in Fig. 1(b)
in the parameter regions considered. It can be seen that,
as the gas density increases and/or as the laser intensity
increases, the spectrum shifts toward a higher-frequency
region and becomes broader.

More detailed features of the laser pulse passing
through the medium can be revealed with the help of
the Wigner distribution function [18], that allows a view
of temporal variation of the laser spectrum. The Wigner
distributions, calculated under the same conditions as in
Fig. 1, are displayed in Fig. 2. It can be observed that,
owing to the phase modulation induced by plasmas pro-
duced in the medium, the laser frequency increases with
time (becomes positively chirped) in the leading edge,
and then decreases (becomes negatively chirped) back
to the original frequency in the remaining part of the
pulse. We note that at the moment when the plasma-
induced chirp changes sign from positive to negative,
the production rate of electrons reaches its maximum.
This moment, at which the laser experiences a maximum
blueshift, comes earlier in time as the laser intensity in-

creases, as can be seen from Fig. 2.

When focused laser beams are used, as in usual high
harmonic generation experiments, due regard should also
be paid to the focusing eﬀect that can change the am-
plitude and phase of the laser ﬁeld.
In fact, in three-
dimensional (3D) simulations this focusing eﬀect could
have been automatically considered. Apparently, how-
ever, the 1D wave equation in Eq. (1) cannot deal with
this eﬀect. Nevertheless, via Eq. (2) the focusing eﬀect
can be taken into account along the propagation axis as
follows:

E1f (x, t) = E1(x, t)f (x) exp [iΦf (x)],

(3)

where f (x) = [1 + 4(x/b)2]−1/2 and Φf (x) =
− tan−1(2x/b) represent, respectively, the amplitude and
phase changes due to the focusing [20], and b is the con-
focal parameter. The laser ﬁeld given in the form of Eq.
(3) now suitably describes the phase modulation induced
by plasmas and the focusing eﬀect along the axis, and
can be used for discussing the phase matching issue of
high harmonics generated on the propagation axis.

We next discuss the propagation of high harmonic
ﬁelds. Since the change in the refractive index in the
presence of plasmas is much smaller for higher-frequency
waves, we may ignore here the plasma eﬀect. Then
the Green function method enables us to write a solu-
tion of the 3D wave equation ∇2Eh − c−2(∂2Eh/∂t2) =
4πc−2(∂2P/∂t2) in the following integral form:

Eh(r, t) = −

(4)

where t′ is the retarded time deﬁned by t′ = t − |r − r′|/c,
and the laser-induced polarization P is given in terms of
the gas density N0 and the atomic dipole moment d by
P (r′, t′) = N0d(r′, t′). Equation (4) clearly indicates that
the harmonic ﬁeld Eh at t is determined by the coherent
sum of the dipole accelerations of atoms in the medium
calculated at the retarded time t′.

In our 1D calculations, a medium lies on the propaga-
tion axis, and the integration in Eq. (4) is performed in
practice over the 1D space along the axis. The medium,
a Ne gas of length l = 700 µm at ≃ 28 Torr, is uniformly
discretized by 200 points, and at each point the dipole
acceleration is calculated by numerically solving the 1D
Schr¨odinger equation for an atom in the laser ﬁeld E1f
given in Eq. (3), with ∆t = 30 fs, λ = 800 nm, b = 4 mm,
and I = 1 × 1015 W/cm2 at the entrance of the medium.
After suitably weighted by a constant factor to yield the
correct gas density, the results are then added according
to Eq. (4) to give Eh.

The high harmonic spectrum calculated in the above
way is presented in Fig. 3, which shows the respective
roles played by the laser focusing and plasmas in the
formation of macroscopic harmonic ﬁelds. In Fig. 3(b),
we neglect the plasma eﬀect by setting n(x, t) = 1 to

2

concentrate only on the focusing eﬀect. Both the focus-
ing and plasma eﬀects are fully considered in Fig. 3(c),
and for comparison we present in Fig. 3(a) a single-atom
spectrum calculated for an atom located at the entrance
of the medium. Whereas the single-atom spectrum in
Fig. 3(a) is smeared with a complicated structure in the
plateau region, the macroscopic harmonic spectrum in
Fig. 3(b) exhibits discrete harmonic peaks. This is be-
cause the intensity-sensitive harmonic components (the
long quantum-path component and multiple-recollision
components), which give rise to the complicated struc-
ture, are suppressed due to their poor phase-matching
conditions, leaving only the short quantum-path compo-
nent [10,21]. Here we emphasize that the variation in
the laser intensity caused by the focusing as represented
by f 2(x) is mainly responsible for this cleaning up of
the harmonic spectrum. At very low gas densities, we
may observe a harmonic spectrum similar to that shown
in Fig. 3(b). However, at the gas density used in Fig.
3(c), a further change in the harmonic spectrum is caused
by the plasma eﬀect: harmonics of low order (43rd and
below) undergo spectral broadening, while higher-order
harmonics get sharpened.

The plasma-induced harmonic line broadening and
narrowing are detailed in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.
The mechanism that shapes high harmonic lines can
be explained by making a comparison between the
plasma-induced chirp and the dynamically-induced chirp
[5,11,18]. Considering that only the leading edge of the
laser pulse, where the depletion of neutral atoms is not se-
vere and the electron density is low, is important for the
phase-matched harmonic generation, we focus only on
this part of the laser pulse. The leading edge of the laser
pulse, in which the laser frequency increases with time
due to the plasma eﬀect (Fig. 2), tends to generate posi-
tively chirped high harmonics. This eﬀect is opposed by
the dynamic single-atom eﬀect that, in the present case,
forces high harmonics to become negatively chirped [22].
Depending on system parameters and harmonic order,
one eﬀect matches or dominates over the other. For in-
stance, for the low-order harmonics in Fig. 4, the dynamic
negative chirp is very small [Fig. 4(b)], and the plasma
eﬀect dominantly aﬀects the time-frequency characteris-
tics of high harmonics in such a way as to make high
harmonics become positively chirped [Fig. 4(d)], leading
to spectral line broadening [Fig. 4(c)]. In contrast, the
dynamic negative chirp of higher-order harmonics in Fig.
5(b) is substantially large, and the plasma-induced posi-
tive chirp more or less cancels out the dynamic chirp [Fig.
5(d)], resulting in harmonic line narrowing [Fig. 5(c)]. In
both cases of Figs. 4 and 5, the plasma eﬀect blueshifts
the central frequencies of high harmonics.

In conclusion, we have investigated the plasma-induced
phase modulation of intense femtosecond laser pulses and
its eﬀects on macroscopic high harmonic spectra, using a
simple but accurate 1D model. It has been shown that

the plasmas produced in the medium induce a positive
frequency chirp on the leading edge of the laser pulses.
Strikingly, the plasma-induced chirp, which broadens the
laser spectrum, can lead not only to broadening but also
to narrowing of harmonic spectral lines. The underlying
mechanism has been explained by comparing the plasma-
induced positive chirp with the dynamically-induced neg-
ative chirp. In stark contrast to the widely reported ﬁnd-
ing (in regimes well below saturation) that high harmon-
ics are negatively chirped [21,23,24], this study clearly
demonstrates that, under laser ﬁelds of high intensity
and gas pressures not too low, high harmonics can be-
come free of chirp, or even become positively chirped,
thanks to the plasma eﬀect. This suggests a way to con-
trol the chirp and spectral line shape of high harmonics
using the plasma eﬀect.

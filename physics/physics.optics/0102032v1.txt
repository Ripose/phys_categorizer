Abstract

We report measurements of thermal self-locking of a Fabry-Perot cavity containing a potassium
niobate (KNbO3) crystal. From the shape and width of the cavity transmission signals, we determine
−11 m/W]
absorption coeﬃcients for our crystal at 846 nm [α = 0.0034(22) m
and 423 nm [13(2) m−1]. Our method is particularly well suited to bulk absorption measurements
where absorption is small compared to scattering. We also report new measurements of the temperature
dependence of the index of refraction at 846 nm, and compare to values in the literature.

Introduction

For cw laser second harmonic generation in a build-up cavity, thermal issues in the nonlinear crystal inevitably
come into play. This is particularly true at high laser powers. In typical applications, a Fabry-Perot build-
up cavity increases the fundamental laser intensity by one or two orders of magnitude compared to the
single-pass intensity. The nonlinear crystal absorbs a small fraction of the fundamental power, heats up,
and changes the cavity properties. Thermal lensing changes the cavity’s spatial mode. Nonlinear absorption
changes the cavity’s ﬁnesse. Thermal expansion and changes in the crystal’s index of refraction change the
cavity’s optical path length.

These eﬀects are well known, and have been observed by several groups working in this ﬁeld [1].
Thermally-induced changes in the build-up cavity sometimes limit the second-harmonic generation eﬃciency.
In many cases, they are nuisances that can be worked around. However, these changes can be used as a
sensitive diagnostic tool for accurately characterizing nonlinear crystal properties.

For gases and atomic vapors, measuring optical properties of materials inside Fabry-Perot cavities has a
long history [2], particularly in relation to optical bistability, saturable absorption, and index of refraction
measurements. Thermal and collisional properties of gases have also been measured in this way [3]. However,
no systematic analysis for solids has been carried out for Fabry-Perot measurements.
In some ways, Fabry-Perot measurements are similar to laser calorimetry [4].

In those calorimetry
measurements, a laser passes through a thermally isolated absorbing crystal and heats it slightly. From the
temperature rise, laser power, thermal mass, and thermal conductivity it is possible to determine an optical
absorption coeﬃcient for the crystal. Comparing calorimetry to our Fabry-Perot measurements, both are
photothermal methods. Both can have high sensitivities to small absorptions. In contrast to calorimetry,
our “thermometer” is the power-induced shift in the cavity resonance frequency. Fabry-Perot measurements
can typically reach much higher intensities, making nonlinear eﬀects more apparent.

This paper presents a detailed study of the thermal response of KNbO3 inside a Fabry-Perot build-up
cavity. We use this response to determine a new value for the optical absorption coeﬃcients in KNbO3 at
846 nm and 423 nm, and to measure the eﬀects of blue-light-induced infrared absorption (BLIIRA). We also
measure the temperature-dependence of the index of refraction for light polarized along the b and c crystal
axes. These measurements are compared to values from the literature.

2 Experimental Setup

Our experimental setup is typical for cw second-harmonic generation in an external build-up cavity (see
It produces
Figure 1). This laser system is designed for a calcium laser cooling experiment at 423 nm.

typically 75 mW at 423 nm, measured outside the cavity.

The laser system consists of a single frequency extended cavity diode laser at 846 nm ampliﬁed in a
single-pass through a tapered laser diode [5]. The extended cavity diode laser is frequency-stabilized relative
to a separate optical cavity using the Pound-Drever method [6] to provide both short and long-term stability.
After optical isolation, polarization correction, and mode matching, we inject 250 mW into the Gaussian
mode of a four-mirror folded (bowtie) Fabry-Perot cavity with roughly 80% eﬃciency. Higher-order modes
in the cavity are less than 5% of the Gaussian mode. The input coupler reﬂectivity is 96.6%, and the
other three mirror reﬂectivities are > 99.5% in the infrared. The radius of curvature for the two curved
mirrors is 100 mm, and they are separated by a distance of 117 mm. The angle of incidence on the curved
mirrors is 6.5
, minimizing the ellipticity of the beam waist inside the crystal (41.1 and 40.7 µm in the
saggital and tangential planes, as determined from the cavity geometry). The round-trip cavity length is
618 mm. The KNbO3 crystal [7] is a-cut and antireﬂection-coated (R <0.25%) at 846 nm. The non-critical
phase-matching temperature is
C, for light polarized along the b-axis. The crystal is mounted on a
Peltier-cooled copper block. An AD590 temperature sensor and a thermister embedded in the copper mount
monitor the crystal temperature. The entire bowtie cavity is enclosed in a sealed aluminum box, ﬁlled with
dry oxygen at atmospheric pressure.

3 Transmission Lineshape Without Blue Light

When laser light incident on the bowtie cavity is polarized along the c-axis, it is impossible to meet the
phase-matching condition for non-critical second harmonic generation at λ = 846 nm, and no blue light is
generated. Previous measurements in KNbO3 have shown that even small amounts of blue light dramatically
change the infrared absorption properties [8, 9, 10]. We address this blue-light-induced-infrared-absorption
(BLIIRA) later in the paper. However, in this section we discuss infrared absorption in the absence of blue
light, i.e.: when the incident laser beam is polarized along the c-axis.

One of the ﬂat mirrors in the bowtie cavity is mounted on a piezoelectric crystal, and we use this crystal
to change the optical length of the cavity. A small amount of infrared light is transmitted through the cavity
mirrors, and we measure this light while sweeping the cavity length. When the piezo-mounted mirror passes
through the position for cavity resonance (i.e.: when the roundtrip pathlength in the cavity is an integer
multiple of the laser wavelength), the power circulating in the cavity, and transmitted through the cavity
end mirror, increases. The transmission lineshape is Lorenzian in the absence of disturbing eﬀects:

where ν0 is the resonant frequency of the cavity, 2/√F is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and P0
is the infra-red power at the peak of the Lorenzian.

The KNbO3 crystal inside the bowtie cavity absorbs a small amount of the laser power and heats up.
This changes the crystal’s length and index of refraction, which in turn changes the optical path length of
the bowtie cavity. We model the overall eﬀect by replacing ν0 with ν0 + ηP/P0. Accordingly, Equation 1
becomes

P (ν) =

where y = P/P0 is the normalized transmission, and the frequency ν is measured relative to the unshifted
frequency ν0. Transmission lineshapes of this kind are typical of optically bi-stable devices.

The peak in the transmission curve occurs when y = 1 and ν = η. Figure 2 shows the transmission
lineshape for both low and high laser powers. On the same ﬁgure we plot a ﬁt of the data to Equation
2. The asymmetry in the transmission lineshape at high powers is due to thermal changes in the optical
pathlength. When sweeping the cavity from low to high frequencies as in Figure 2, the power-dependent
cavity resonance is eﬀectively “dragged along” from ν = ν0 to ν = nu0 + η as the cavity length changes.
This is known as “thermal self-locking” [3], and the value of η is called the “self-locking range.”

For a given power incident on the cavity, we determine the self-locking range η using a nonlinear least-
squares ﬁt of the measured transmission lineshape to Equation 2. For the highest laser intensities, it appears

2

that a better overall ﬁt is obtained by replacing ηy in Equation 2 by a higher order polynomial. However,
the ﬁt in these high intensity data is hampered because the ﬁt function is not single-valued, as can be seen
in Figure 2. For these measurements, we determine the values of η visually by ﬁnding the frequency at the
peak of the transmission curves.

Our values for η as a function of infrared power in the bowtie cavity are shown in Figure 3a. The error
bars indicate the 1 σ statistical spread in 5 measurements at each power setting. For linear absorption, the
cavity shift, η, should be a linear function of the circulating power. However our measurements indicate a
quadratic dependence of the cavity shift on the circulating power, suggesting that the dominant absorption
mechanism is two-photon absorption in the infrared.

We convert η into a temperature rise inside the crystal by measuring the temperature change necessary
to shift the cavity resonance frequency by one free spectral range. In these calibration measurements, we
attenuate the incident laser power to 10 µW to avoid laser-heating in the crystal. The cavity mirror positions
remain ﬁxed, and the laser frequency is constant. Using the Peltier device, we change the temperature of
C, the resonant
the crystal by several degrees while monitoring the cavity transmission. At T =

We calibrate our photodiode signal using a power meter, and measure the eﬃciency of the optical path
to convert this IR signal to a power circulating inside the cavity. The conversion from cavity shift to
temperature rise can also be derived from measurements of the change in the index of refraction with
temperature. From the published values of dn/dT [11] and the geometry of our bowtie cavity, we calculated
what the temperature-dependent shift ought to be. The calculation agrees with our data for the b-axis.
However, we ﬁnd a small diﬀerence between the calculation and our data for the c-axis, as discussed later in
this paper.

Using our measurements, we convert η into ∆T , the diﬀerence in temperature between the crystal axis
where the laser propagates and the crystal wall which is kept constant by our temperature control circuit.
Figure 3b shows a plot of the temperature rise as a function of the infrared power circulating inside the cavity.
It is relatively simple to convert this temperature rise into a measure of the optical absorption coeﬃcient of
KNbO3 by solving the heat transfer equation, which we do below.

4 Solving the Heat Transfer Equation

We solve the heat transfer equation in cylindrical coordinates. The laser beam is in the TEM00 Gaussian
mode, with a 41 µm waist. The confocal parameter of the beam is 6.2 mm, and at the face of the crystal, the
beam waist is only 7% larger than in the center of the crystal. So we approximate the laser beam as axially
symmetric and Gaussian with a 41 µm waist along the entire 10 mm length of the crystal. Our crystal has
a square cross section, 3 mm on a side. However, because it is so much larger than the laser beam waist, we
assume that the crystal is cylindrical also, with a 1.5 mm diameter. With these assumptions, the equilibrium
temperature inside the crystal is determined by solving the heat equation in the form:

coeﬃcients are only statistical. We have a systematic uncertainty in the power measurements of 10%. Our
assumption of cylindrical symmetry in the crystal for solving the heat equation also introduces an error. The
error is known, but related to this is the fact that our laser does not propagate exactly down the center of
the crystal. These errors show up in the ln(b2) term in Equation 9, and probably add
8% uncertainty to
the measurements. Our best numbers for the absorption coeﬃcients are therefore α = 0.0034(22) m−1 and
10−11 m/W. These numbers do not reﬂect the uncertainty in the thermal conductivity, which
β = 3.2(5)
we do not know. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst determination of the two-photon absorption coeﬃcient
at any wavelength in KNbO3.

10−6 m, b = 1.5

Earlier work on the linear absorption coeﬃcient for KNbO3 [4] found α = 0.001cm−1 = 0.1m−1 at 860
nm. This value is much higher than this work. It may be that some of the absorption measured in previous
work was two-photon absorption. That work used laser calorimetry to measure the absorption coeﬃcient at
speciﬁc laser lines from 457 nm to 1064 nm. At 860 nm, they focused 900 mW into a 5 mm crystal, and it
is likely that the intensity was high enough for multiphoton absorption to be important.

∼

Our method for determining the one and two-photon absorption coeﬃcients is quite general. It is indepen-
dent of measurements of light scattering inside the crystal. It is also independent of reﬂection measurements
at the crystal faces. This method is particularly well suited to measurements of optical absorption where
the absorption coeﬃcients are comparable to or smaller than scattering and reﬂection coeﬃcients.

5 Transmission Lineshape With Blue Light

When infrared light incident on the bowtie cavity is polarized along the b-axis of the KNbO3 crystal, it is
possible to meet the phase-matching conditions required for generating the second harmonic at 423 nm. The
presence of blue light in the crystal dramatically alters the transmission lineshape. Not only is the blue
light itself absorbed by the crystal, it also signiﬁcantly increases the absorption of the infrared light. This is
called “blue-light-induced-infrared-absorption” (BLIIRA), and it has been studied at length in the literature
10−4
[4, 8, 9, 10]. Previous work has found BLIIRA to be signiﬁcant at blue light intensities down to 7
W/cm2. BLIIRA is minimized at longer wavelengths and at higher crystal temperatures [10]. However, for
our calcium work, we require high powers at 423 nm.

×

As before, we ﬁx the laser frequency and scan the cavity length through the resonance condition. Both
blue light at 423 nm and a small amount of infrared light at 846 nm exits the cavity. We separate these
wavelengths using dichroic mirrors, which transmit 95% in the blue and reﬂect 99.5% in the infrared. To
make sure that no blue light reaches the infrared laser beam detector, we use four of these mirrors in series
in the infrared beam path after the doubling cavity (see Figure 1).

In these experiments, we do not independently control the infrared and blue beam intensities. Rather,
we optimize the crystal temperature to maximize the blue light production for each infrared power setting
in the steady state. Losses inside the doubling cavity limit the maximum infrared power circulating inside
and therefore the maximum blue light produced.

The transmission lineshape for the cavity when blue light is present is shown in Figure 4a for our
highest IR powers. The temperature rise inside the crystal is signiﬁcant. At maximum power, as the cavity
approaches the resonance condition, only a small amount of blue light is initially generated because the
crystal temperature is too low to meet the phase matching condition for second harmonic generation exactly
(see Figure 4b). Closer to the cavity resonance condition, the circulating power increases, the crystal heats
up, and more blue light is generated, which heats the crystal even more. This positive feedback continues,
and the cavity demonstrates thermal self-locking for up to 90 MHz, as shown in Figure 4a.

The blue light signal in Figure 4b has a shoulder on the low-frequency side of the maximum. This is
a Maker fringe. As stated previously, we initially optimize the crystal temperature for optimum blue light
production in the steady state. At the highest intensities, the temperature shift (
C) due to thermal
∼
self-locking of the cavity is a few times the temperature phase matching bandwidth.

0.4

o

Because of these complicated thermal conditions, and especially because the blue light production is not
constant across the transmission lineshape, we are reluctant to ﬁt the lineshape to any model for the highest
laser intensities. Instead, we ﬁnd the self-locking range graphically. It is the falling step at the far right hand
side of the infrared transmission peak shown in Figure 4. This choice is valid as long as there is no signiﬁcant
thermally-induced change in the cavity coupling eﬃciency. We can monitor these changes by measuring the
light reﬂected from the cavity. For the relatively modest intensities in this study, the minimum reﬂected
light (which corresponds to the maximum light inside the cavity) changes by only a few percent, and only
at the highest intensity measurements. The statistical scatter in the data is larger than this, and we neglect
this small systematic error.

At lower laser intensities, where BLIIRA and other absorption processes are less severe, we use a least-
squares method similar to Section 3 to ﬁnd the self-locking range η. The self-locking range is plotted as a
function of infrared laser power in Figure 5a. Note that except for the two highest power measurements, the
frequency doubling process is not saturated (see Figure 4c).

With blue light present in the crystal, the temperature rise inside the crystal has three sources: infrared
absorption (one and two photon), blue light absorption, and BLIIRA. We can easily subtract oﬀ the in-
frared contribution to the self-locking range using the data in Figure 3 as a look-up-table. The remaining
contribution to the self-locking range is due to temperature rise from blue light absorption and BLIIRA.

Because the blue light intensity and the temperature are not constant along the length of the axis of the
crystal, we must be careful about how we deﬁne the temperature rise and the blue light intensity. We will
deﬁne the absorption coeﬃcient at 423 nm, δ, by the equation

∆P =

IbδdV = δPbL

ZV

(10)

where Ib is the blue light intensity inside the crystal, Pb is the measured blue power, and L is the length of the
crystal. In the non-depleted pump plane-wave approximation, the blue light intensity grows quadratically
with distance z in the crystal. With the deﬁnition from Equation 10, the blue light intensity can be written
4r2/a2), where a is the Gaussian waist for the infrared beam in the
as Ib(r, z) = (12Pbz2/πa2L2) exp(
crystal and we explicitly assume that the Gaussian waist for the blue beam is a/√2.

10−8m/W. Apparently, there are no measurements in the literature of the KNbO3 absorption coeﬃcient
2.2
at 423 nm. However, there are measurements close to this wavelength [4], and a value of 13.3% per cm is
reasonable. For this determination of the absorption coeﬃcient, we have the same kinds of uncertainties as
before, namely in the beam position in the crystal and in the power measurement. We estimate the error in
this measurement to be 15 %. Our ﬁnal number for the absorption coeﬃcient at 423 nm is δ = 13(2), where
the number in parenthesis is the uncertainty in the last digit.

This uncertainty estimate is perhaps conservative. We have a second KNbO3 crystal.

In a simple
transmission measurement at 423 nm, using the blue light after the frequency doubling cavity, we ﬁnd the
linear absorption coeﬃcient to be 13% per cm, in agreement with the work above.

We veriﬁed the validity of our perturbative approximation by solving Equation 11 numerically. In the
numerical solution, the temperature proﬁle is quadratic in z except at the very end of the crystal, where is
ﬂattens out slightly to meet the boundary condition of no heat ﬂowing out the crystal face. With our values
of δ, ξ, a, Pb, and Pir, the calculated temperature T ′ agrees with our data to about one percent.

It is interesting that the above treatment of BLIIRA does not distinguish between blue-light induced
infrared absorption and infrared light induced blue-light absorption. This model of BLIIRA only postulates
that there is a two-color two-photon absorption cross-section. This treatment of two-color two-photon
absorption in KNbO3 is perhaps simplistic. However, it serves the purpose in this paper of demonstrating
that thermal self-locking of a Fabry-Perot cavity can be used to sensitively characterize the linear and
nonlinear optical properties of an absorbing crystal.

6 New Measurements of dn/dT

From the calibration measurements that convert η in Figures 3 and 5 to a temperature rise, we can extract
the temperature-dependent change in the index of refraction for KNbO3. When the crystal temperature
changes, the optical pathlength of the bowtie cavity also changes because both the crystal length and the
index of refraction depend on temperature:

In a relatively simple measurement, we can determine dn/dT for the crystal across a wide range of
temperatures. We ﬁx the laser frequency and the cavity mirror positions. We attenuate the laser intensity
to 10µW to avoid thermal self-locking. The crystal temperature can be independently controlled because
it is mounted on a Peltier device. We measure the cavity transmission while slowly sweeping the crystal
temperature over several degrees. At certain temperatures, the cavity optical pathlength meets the resonance
condition, and we measure a peak in the cavity transmission. The temperature between transmission peaks
in these measurements corresponds to changing the optical pathlength by one optical wavelenth, 846 nm.

To check our data, we made an additional measurement. When the polarization of the light incident
on the cavity is rotated slightly relative to the c-axis, the transmission lineshape has two features, one for
each polarization. Because the index of refraction is diﬀerent for the two polarizations (b and c), the optical
pathlength is also diﬀerent, and each polarization is transmitted at a diﬀerent cavity length. When we change
the temperature of the crystal, the two peaks in the transmission lineshape shift by diﬀerent amounts in
diﬀerent directions, as shown in Figure 7. We measured these shifts for a set of small temperature changes
C and determined the relative changes in the indices of refraction, (dnc/dT ) / (dnb/dT ). These
near -11.5
measurements conﬁrm our low temperature data in Figure 6. Following the treatment of Ghosh, we ﬁt our
dn/dT data for the b-axis to a second-order polynomial, and ﬁnd

7 Conclusion

We have demonstrated how thermal self-locking of a Fabry-Perot cavity can be used to determine optical
properties of nonlinear crystals. We have determined new values for the one- and two-photon absorption
coeﬃcients in KNbO3 at 846 nm. We have also determined new values for the one photon (linear) absorption
coeﬃcient at 423 nm, and a BLIIRA absorption coeﬃcient under speciﬁc circumstances. Finally, we present
new measurements of the temperature-dependent change in the indices of refraction for the b and c axes.

These measurements all derive from the thermal response of an absorbing Fabry-Perot cavity to light
circulating in the cavity. The methods are general and can be widely applied to other systems, particularly
those in which the absorption coeﬃcients are small compared to scattering and reﬂection coeﬃcients.

Figure 7: Transmitted lineshape as a function of cavity length for two temperatures. The upper trace has
been displaced for clarity. The polarization of the light incident on the cavity is rotated a few degrees relative
to the c-axis. The larger feature is polarized along the c-axis, and the smaller feature is polarized along the
b-axis, as labeled. This shows the magnitude and direction of the change in the cavity resonance length with
temperature.

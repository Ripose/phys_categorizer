We consider a plane electromagnetic wave incident on a periodic stack of dielectric layers. One

of the alternating layers has an anisotropic refractive index with an oblique orientation of the

principal axis relative to the normal to the layers. It was shown recently that an obliquely incident

light, upon entering such a periodic stack, can be converted into an abnormal axially frozen mode

with drastically enhanced amplitude and zero normal component of the group velocity. The stack

reﬂectivity at this point can be very low, implying nearly total conversion of the incident light into

the frozen mode with huge energy density, compared to that of the incident light. Supposedly,

the frozen mode regime requires strong birefringence in the anisotropic layers – by an order of

magnitude stronger than that available in common anisotropic dielectric materials. In this paper

we show how to overcome the above problem by exploiting higher frequency bands of the photonic

spectrum. We prove that a robust frozen mode regime at optical wavelengths can be realized in

stacks composed of common anisotropic materials, such as Y V O4, LiN b, CaCO3, and the like.

INTRODUCTION

In photonic crystals, the speed of light is deﬁned as the wave group velocity, ~u,

where ~k is the Bloch wave vector and ω = ω

is the respective frequency. At certain

frequencies, the dispersion relation ω

of a photonic crystal develops stationary points

in the vicinity of which the group velocity vanishes. Zero group velocity usually implies

that the respective Bloch eigenmode does not transfer electromagnetic energy. Indeed, with
certain reservations, the energy ﬂux ~S of a Bloch mode is

~u = ∂ω/∂~k,

(3)

where W is the electromagnetic energy density, associated with this mode. If W is limited,
then the group velocity ~u and the energy ﬂux ~S vanish simultaneously at any stationary

point (2) of the dispersion relation. Such modes are commonly referred to as slow modes,

or slow light. Examples of diﬀerent stationary points (2) are shown in Fig. 1., where each

of the respective frequencies ωa, ωb, ωg and ω0 is associated with slow light.

A common problem with slow modes is that most of them cannot be excited in semi-

inﬁnite photonic crystal by incident light.

Indeed, consider plane monochromatic wave

incident on a semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal with the electromagnetic dispersion relation

shown in Fig. 1. If the frequency ω is close to the band edge frequency ωg in Fig. 1, then

the incident wave will be totally reﬂected back into space, as seen in Fig. 2.

In another case, where the incident wave frequency is close to the characteristic value

ωa or ωb in Fig. 1, some portion of the incident wave will be transmitted in the photonic

crystal, but none in the form of the slow mode corresponding to the respective stationary

point. This means, for example, that at the frequency ωa, the transmitted light is a Bloch

wave with the ﬁnite group velocity and the wave number diﬀerent from that corresponding

to the point a in Fig. 1.

Let us turn now to the stationary inﬂection point 0 of the dispersion relation in Fig. 1,

where both the ﬁrst and the second derivatives of the frequency ω with respect to k vanish,

The frequency ω0 of stationary inﬂection point is associated with the so-called frozen mode

regime [1, 2, 3]. In such a case, the incident plane wave can be transmitted into the photonic

crystal with little reﬂection, as seen in Fig. 2. Having entered the photonic slab, the

light is 100% converted into the slow mode with inﬁnitesimal group velocity and drastically

enhanced amplitude. Under the frozen mode regime, vanishingly small group velocity ~u in

FIG. 2: Transmittance τ as a function of incident light frequency ω for the semi-inﬁnite photonic

slab with the dispersion relation presented in Fig. 1. The characteristic frequencies ωa, ωb, ω0, and

ωg are associated with the respective stationary points in Fig. 1. At ω ≥ ωg (within the photonic

band gap) the incident light is totally reﬂected by the slab.

Eq. (3) is oﬀset by a huge value of the energy density W . As the result, the energy ﬂux

(3) associated with the frozen mode remains ﬁnite and comparable with that of the incident

wave. In the vicinity of the frozen mode frequency ω0, the electromagnetic energy density

W associated with the slow (frozen) mode displays a resonance-like behavior

Remarkably, the transmittance τ at ω ≈ ω0 remains ﬁnite and may even be close to unity, as

shown in Fig. 2. The latter implies that a signiﬁcant portion of the incident light is converted

into the frozen mode with nearly zero group velocity and huge amplitude, compared to that

of the incident wave. In reality, the electromagnetic energy density W of the frozen mode

will be limited by such factors as absorption, nonlinear eﬀects, imperfection of the periodic

dielectric array, deviation of the incident radiation from a perfect plane monochromatic

wave, ﬁniteness of the photonic slab dimensions, etc. Still, with all these limitations in

place, the frozen mode regime can be very attractive for various practical applications.

From now on we restrict ourselves to the case of lossless periodic layered media (periodic

stacks), which can be viewed as one dimensional photonic crystals. According to [2], at

normal incidence, the frozen mode regime in a periodic stack can only occur if some of the

layers display suﬃciently strong circular birefringence (Faraday rotation). In addition, each

unit cell of the periodic layered array must contain at least two layers with signiﬁcant and

misaligned in-plane anisotropy.

If the above conditions are not met, the electromagnetic

dispersion relation of the periodic stack cannot develop stationary inﬂection point (4) and,

therefore, cannot support the frozen mode regime at normal incidence. At the microwave

frequency range, one can ﬁnd a number of materials meeting the above requirements. But

at infrared and optical frequencies, the circular birefringence of known transparent magnetic

materials becomes too small to support a robust frozen mode regime [2]. Since our prime

interest here is with optics, we will explore the ”non-magnetic” approach proposed in [3].

According to [3], the frozen mode regime can occur in nonmagnetic periodic stacks with

special conﬁgurations requiring some layers to display appreciable oblique (neither in-plane,

nor axial) anisotropy. On the other hand, at optical frequencies, all commercially available

anisotropic dielectrics display substantially weaker anisotropy, compared to what would be

the optimal value. According to [3], too weak anisotropy can push the frozen mode frequency

too close to the nearest band edge, resulting in almost total reﬂectance of the incident light.

The high reﬂectance of the slab, in turn, implies very low eﬃciency of conversion of the

incident light into the slow mode. In this paper we show that in fact, the negative eﬀect of

the weak anisotropy on the frozen mode regime can be completely overcome by proper design

of the layered structure. As the result, a robust frozen mode regime at optical frequencies

can be achieved in periodic stacks incorporating real anisotropic materials such as yttrium

vanadate, lithium niobate, and the like, where the dielectric anisotropy is one-two orders of

5

magnitude short of the ”optimal” value. The idea is to choose the parameters of the periodic

stack so that a stationary inﬂection point associated with the frozen mode regime develops

at higher photonic bands. For a given frequency range, this requires thicker dielectric layers,

which could be an additional practical advantage. A side eﬀect of using higher photonic

bands is that the eﬀective bandwidth of the frozen mode regime appears to be narrower,

compared to the case of hypothetical materials with much stronger anisotropy used in [3]

for numerical simulations.

The practical development of frozen mode devices from such commodity materials could

lead to revolutionary advances in optical computing, sensing, and information processing.

When practically realized, such frozen mode structures would enable signiﬁcant advances in

all-optical information storage and processing (such as optical memory and buﬀer elements,

optical delay lines) as well as optical sensing, lasing, and nonlinear optics.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss in general terms the

phenomenon of axially frozen mode. The detailed analysis of the mathematical aspects of the

phenomenon can be found in [3]. Then, in section III, using a speciﬁc example of a periodic

array incorporating yttrium vanadate, we demonstrate how a robust frozen mode regime

at optical frequencies can be achieved in a practical setting involving weakly anisotropic

materials. Finally, in Appendix, we brieﬂy overview the electrodynamics of lossless layered

media, introducing basic notations, deﬁnitions, and assumptions used in our computations.

II. AXIALLY FROZEN MODE REGIME AT OBLIQUE INCIDENCE

According to [2, 3], in nonmagnetic periodic stacks, the simplest version of the frozen

mode regime described in the introduction is impossible. Still, a more general phenomenon

referred to as the axially frozen mode regime can occur. This section starts with a brief

general discussion of the phenomenon. Then we turn to the particular case of a periodic

stack incorporating yttrium vanadate layers. The reason we have chosen this particular

material is because its optical properties is very similar to those of other common anisotropic

dielectrics transparent at optical wavelength.

ﬂuxes of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively. The transmitted wave ΨT is

a superposition of two Bloch eigenmodes, each of which can be either propagating or evanescent.

Only propagating modes can transfer electromagnetic energy in the z direction.

Let ΨI, ΨR and ΨT denote the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively.

Due to the boundary conditions (46), all three waves ΨI, ΨR and ΨT must be assigned the

same pair of tangential components kx, ky of the respective wave vector[4, 5]

while their axial (normal) components kz can be diﬀerent. Hereinafter, the symbol kz will

refer only to the transmitted Bloch waves propagating inside the semi-inﬁnite slab

Inside periodic stack (at z > 0):

~k = (kx, ky, kz) .

(7)

The value kz is deﬁned up to a multiple of 2π/L (the Brillouin zone), where L is the period

of the layered structure. For given kx, ky and ω, the value kz is found by solving the time-

harmonic Maxwell equations (37) in periodic medium, that will be done in the following

7

sections. The result can be represented as the axial dispersion relation, which gives the

correspondence between ω and kz at ﬁxed kx, ky

It can be more convenient to deﬁne the axial dispersion relation as the correspondence

between ω and kz at ﬁxed direction ~n of incident light propagation

ω = ω (kz) , at ﬁxed kx, ky.

ω = ω (kz) , at ﬁxed nx, ny,

FIG. 4: Periodic array of anisotropic dielectric layers (A) separated by gaps (B). The anisotropy

axis of the dielectric material (the tetragonal axis, in the case of yttrium vanadate) makes an

oblique angle with the z direction, normal to the layers. The stack parameters used in our numerical

simulations are speciﬁed in formulae (30) and (31).

The transmitted electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT inside the periodic layered medium is not a

single Bloch mode, but it is a superposition of two Bloch modes with diﬀerent polarizations

and diﬀerent values of kz. Of course, the tangential components kx, ky are the same for

either transmitted Bloch mode and the incident wave, as stated by Eq. (6). Generally, there

are three possibilities (see the details in [3]):

FIG. 5: The axial dispersion relation ω(kz) of the periodic stack in Fig. 4 at ﬁxed direction ~n of

light incidence (nx = ny = −0.493489). Small spectral asymmetry and small branch separation

are due to weak anisotropy of yttrium vanadate. Both the asymmetry and the branch separation

are more prononced in upper spectral bands. The wave number kz and the frequency ω are given

in units of 1/L and c/L, respectively.

1. Both Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT are propagating modes, which

means that the respective values of kz are real. For example, at ω < ωa and ω > ωb in

Fig. 6 we have two Bloch modes propagating inside the slab with two diﬀerent group

velocities uz > 0 (double refraction). Note that propagating modes with uz < 0, as

well as evanescent modes with ℑ (kz) < 0, do not contribute to the transmitted wave

ΨT inside the semi-inﬁnite stack in Fig. 3.

stationary inﬂection point at ω0 = 9.164450223.

2. Both Bloch components of ΨT are evanescent, which implies that the respective values

of kz are complex with ℑ (kz) > 0. In particular, this is the case if the frequency ω

falls into a photonic band gap (for example, at ω > ωg in Fig. 1). In such a case, the

incident wave is totally reﬂected back to space.

3. Of particular interest is the case when one of the Bloch components of the transmitted

wave ΨT is a propagating mode (with uz > 0), while the other is an evanescent mode

(with ℑ (kz) > 0)

ΨT = Ψpr + Ψev.

(11)

10

This is the case at the frequency range

ωa < ω < ωb

(12)

in Fig. 6. As the distance z from the slab/vacuum interface increases, the evanescent

contribution Ψev decays as exp (−zℑ (kz)), and the resulting transmitted wave ΨT

turns into a single propagating Bloch eigenmode Ψpr.

Similarly to the case (4) of regular frozen mode, the axially frozen mode is associated

with the axial stationary inﬂection point deﬁned as

The regular stationary inﬂection point (4) is a particular case of (13). Example of axial

dispersion relation displaying such a singularity is shown in Fig. 6.

In the vicinity of

ω0 in Eq.

(13), the electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT inside the slab is a superposition (11) of

one propagating and one evanescent Bloch components. As the frequency ω approaches

the critical point (13), both contributions grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal and

opposite in sign near the slab boundary (at z = 0), as illustrated in Fig. 7.

amplitude |ΨT (0)|2. The incident light has unity amplitude and TE polarization.

Due to the destructive interference at the slab boundary, the resulting electromagnetic

ﬁeld at z = 0 is small enough to satisfy the boundary condition (46). As the distance z from

11

the slab boundary increases, the evanescent component Ψev decays exponentially, while the

amplitude of the propagating component Ψpr remains constant and large, as shown in Figs.

B. Energy density and energy ﬂux of the axially frozen mode

Let ~SI, ~SR and ~ST be the energy ﬂuxes of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves,

respectively. Within the frequency range (12), which includes the critical point (13), the

transmitted wave ΨT is a superposition (11) of propagating and evanescent components.

Only the propagating component Ψpr is responsible for the axial energy ﬂux

The axial energy ﬂux can also be expressed in terms of the axial component uz of the

propagating mode group velocity and the energy density W0 associated with Ψpr

~ST
(cid:16)

.

(cid:17)z

~ST
(cid:16)

(cid:17)z

= W0uz ∝ |Ψpr|2 uz,

(14)

The quantity W0 in Eq.

(14) can be interpreted as the electromagnetic energy density

far from the slab interface, where the electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT reduces to its propagating

component Ψpr.

In the vicinity of the axial stationary inﬂection point (13), the energy

density W0, associated with the axially frozen mode, diverges, while uz → 0. As a result,

12

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

the vanishingly small uz in Eq. (14) is oﬀset by a very large value of W0. The theoretical

analysis of the next section shows that the axial energy ﬂux

in Eq. (14), along with

the slab transmittance τ in (54), remain ﬁnite even at ω = ω0, where the axial component

~ST
(cid:16)

(cid:17)z

of the group velocity vanishes

~ST
(cid:16)

(cid:17)z

> 0, if uz = 0.

The energy conservation consideration allows to ﬁnd the asymptotic frequency depen-
dence of the amplitude |Ψpr|2 of the axially frozen mode in the vicinity of the critical point

(13). Indeed, in the vicinity of ω0, the axial dispersion relation can be approximated by a

cubic parabola

where ~SI is the ﬁxed energy ﬂux of the incident wave and τ is the transmittance coeﬃcient

deﬁned in (54). Remarkably, the transmittance τ of the semi-inﬁnite slab remains ﬁnite in

the vicinity of the frozen mode frequency ω0, as seen in Figs. 9 and 10. This implies that the

electromagnetic energy density W0 associated with the frozen mode, as well as its amplitude
|Ψpr|2, diverge as ω → ω0. In Figs. 9 and 10 such a behavior is illustrated for two diﬀerent

incident light polarizations.

In reality, under the axial frozen mode regime, the ﬁeld amplitude inside the slab is

limited by various physical factors mentioned earlier in this paper. Still, with all these
~ST

limitations in place, the normal energy ﬂux

remains ﬁnite and comparable with that

(cid:16)
of the incident wave. The latter implies that a substantial portion of the incident wave is

converted into the axially frozen mode with drastically enhanced amplitude and nearly zero

axial component uz of the group velocity. In many respects, the phenomenon of axial frozen

C. Physical conditions for the axially frozen mode regime in layered media

The physical conditions under which a non-magnetic layered structure can support the

(axial) frozen mode regime can be grouped in two categories. The ﬁrst one comprises

several symmetry restrictions. The second category includes some basic qualitative recom-

mendations which would ensure the robustness of the frozen mode regime, provided that the

symmetry conditions for the regime are met. In what follows we brieﬂy reiterate those con-

15

ditions and then show how they apply to periodic stacks incorporating some real dielectric

materials.

1. Symmetry conditions

There are two fundamental necessary conditions for the frozen mode regime. The ﬁrst

one is that the Bloch dispersion relation ω

in the periodic layered medium must display

~k
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

the so-called axial spectral asymmetry

ω (kx, ky, kz) 6= ω (kx, ky, −kz) .

(20)

As shown in [3], this condition is necessary for the existence of the axial stationary inﬂection

point (13) in the electromagnetic dispersion relation of an arbitrary periodic layered medium.
The second necessary condition is that for the given direction ~k of wave propagation, the

Bloch eigenmodes Ψ~k with diﬀerent polarizations must have the same symmetry. In the case
of oblique propagation in periodic layered media, the latter condition implies that for the
given ~k, the Bloch eigenmodes are neither TE nor TM

Ψ~k is neither TE nor TM.

(21)

The condition (20) imposes certain restrictions on (i) the point symmetry group G of the
periodic layered array and (ii) on the direction ~k of the transmitted wave propagation inside

the layered medium. While the condition (21) may impose some additional restriction on
the direction of ~k.

The restriction on the symmetry of the periodic stack following from the requirement

(20) of the axial spectral asymmetry is

mz /∈ G and 2z /∈ G.

(22)

where mz is the mirror plane parallel to the layers, 2z is the 2-fold rotation about the z axis.

An immediate consequence of the criterion (22) is that least one of the alternating layers of

the periodic stack must be an anisotropic dielectric material with nonzero εxz and/or εyz,

where the z direction is normal to the layers

εxz 6= 0

and/or

εyz 6= 0

(23)

16

Otherwise, the operation 2z will be present in the symmetry group G of the periodic stack.

The condition (20) also imposes a restriction on the direction of wave propagation. Specif-
ically, the Bloch wave vector ~k must be oblique to the stack layers, which means that ~k is

neither parallel, nor perpendicular to the z direction

kx 6= 0 and/or ky 6= 0.

The latter condition implies that the frozen mode regime cannot occur at normal incidence,

regardless of the periodic stack geometry and composition. While the condition (23) implies

that at least one of the alternating layers must be cut at an oblique angle relative to the

principle axes of its permittivity tensor. If either of the above two conditions is not satisﬁed,

the dispersion relation ω

will be axially symmetric

~k
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

ω (kx, ky, kz) = ω (kx, ky, −kz) ,

(24)

which rules out the possibility of stationary inﬂection point and the frozen mode regime.

If all the above necessary conditions are met, then the (axial) frozen mode regime is, at

least, not forbidden by symmetry. More details on the symmetry aspects of the frozen mode

regime can be found in [3], Section II and [2], Sections I and II.

2. Additional physical requirements

In practice, as soon as the symmetry conditions are met, one can almost certainly achieve

the (axial) frozen mode regime at any desirable frequency ω within certain frequency range.

The frequency range is determined by the layers thicknesses and the dielectric materials

used, while a speciﬁc value of ω within the range can be selected by the direction ~n of the

light incidence. The problem is that unless the physical parameters of the stack layers lie

within a certain range, the eﬀects associated with the frozen mode regime can be insigniﬁcant

or even practically undetectable. The basic guiding principle in choosing appropriate layer

materials is ”moderation”. As soon as the ”moderation” principle is observed, one can

almost certainly achieve the frozen mode regime at prescribed frequency by choosing the

right direction of light incidence. Speciﬁcally, those ”moderation” conditions include:

1. It is desirable that the ratio

∆n
n

17

(25)

of the birefringence and the refractive index of the material of the anisotropic layers

lies somewhere between 2 and 10. If the anisotropy is extremely strong or too weak,

the Bloch waves with diﬀerent polarizations become virtually separated, which ex-

cludes the possibility of a robust frozen mode regime. For example, in the practically

important case of extremely small anisotropy, the two transmitted Bloch waves can

be approximately classiﬁed as TE and TM modes, which is incompatible with the

symmetry condition (21) for the frozen mode regime.

2. The dielectric contrast of the adjacent layers A and B should be signiﬁcant, but not

extreme. The ratio nA/nB anywhere between 1.5 and 20 would be appropriate. In

addition, the dielectric contrast between the layers should match the ratio (25) in the

anisotropic layers: weaker anisotropy would require weaker dielectric contrast between

the layers.

3. Typical layer thickness should be of the order of λ/4n, where λ = 2π/ω is the light

wavelength in vacuum and n is the respective refractive index. In reality, the acceptable

layer thickness can diﬀer from λ/4n by several times either way. But too thick layers

would push the stationary inﬂection point to high-order frequency bands, while too

thin layers would exclude the possibility of the frozen mode regime at the prescribed

frequency range.

The biggest challenge at optical frequencies poses the ﬁrst condition, because most of the

commercially available optical anisotropic crystals have the ratio ∆n/n of only about 0.1.

According to [3], this would push the axial stationary inﬂection point (13) very close to the

photonic band edge and make the photonic crystal almost 100% reﬂective. This indeed would

be the case if we tried to realize the frozen mode regime at the lowest frequency band. But, in

the next section we show that one can successfully solve this problem by moving to a higher

frequency band. So, a robust axially frozen mode regime with almost complete conversion

of the incident light into the frozen mode can be achieved with the commercially available

anisotropic dielectric materials displaying the birefringence ratio (25) by one-two orders of

magnitude smaller, compared to the optimal value used in [3] for numerical simulations.

The drawback though is that using higher photonic frequency bands narrows the bandwidth

of the frozen mode regime by roughly an order of magnitude.

III. PERIODIC STACK INCORPORATING YTTRIUM VANADATE LAYERS

The simplest non-magnetic periodic stack satisfying the symmetry conditions (22) and

(23) and, therefore, capable of supporting the axial frozen mode regime, is shown in Fig.

4. It is composed of anisotropic A layers separated by empty gaps. The anisotropic dielec-

tric layers must display nonzero components εxz and/or εyz. The simplest choice for the

respective permittivity tensor is

Let dA and dB denote the thickness of the A layers and the thickness of the gaps between

them, respectively. For our numerical simulations we can choose

dA = dB = L/2,

(31)

where L is the period of the layered array in Fig. 4.

Let us reiterate that the parameters (29) and (31) are chosen at random. In practice, we

can always adjust them so that the stack suits speciﬁc practical requirements. The struc-

tural period L should be chosen so that the frozen mode regime occurs within a prescribed

frequency range. Then, the direction of light incidence can be adjusted so that the axial

frozen mode regime occurs exactly at a prescribed frequency ω0.

Symmetry arguments similar to those presented in [3] show that in the case of the periodic

array in Fig. 4, the necessary conditions (22) and (21) for the frozen mode regime are satisﬁed

only if the direction ~n of the light incidence lies neither in the x − z, nor y − z plane

nx 6= 0 and ny 6= 0.

(32)

A. Electromagnetic properties in the vicinity of axial frozen mode regime

In Fig. 5 we presented the typical axial dispersion relation ω(kz) of the periodic stack in

Fig. 4 at ﬁxed direction ~n of light incidence. In Fig. 5 we chose

nx = ny = n0, where n0 = −0.493489,

(33)

because this particular direction of light incidence produces the axially frozen mode regime

at certain frequency ω0, shown in Fig. 6. Due to the relatively small anisotropy of yttrium

vanadate, the axial dispersion relation in Fig. 5 displays rather weak asymmetry ω (kz) 6=

ω (−kz), which makes it virtually impossible to develop a stationary inﬂection point at the

lowest spectral branches. As we go to upper photonic bands, the situation improves. In Fig.

6 we present the enlarged fragment of the axial dispersion relation in Fig. 5. This fragment

covers the boundary region between the forth and the ﬁfth bands. At frequency

ω0 = 9.164450223c/L

(34)

one of the spectral branches develops axial stationary inﬂection point (13), associated with

the possibility of the axial frozen mode regime.

20

Our numerical analysis based on the transfer matrix approach (the computational details

are presented in the next section) indeed shows a very robust (axial) frozen mode regime in

this setting, in spite of the fact that the dielectric anisotropy of yttrium vanadate is more

than an order of magnitude short of the optimal value. The drawback though is that the

frequency bandwidth of the eﬀect is roughly an order of magnitude narrower, compared to

what could be achieved with hypothetical materials displaying much stronger anisotropy at

optical frequencies.

Let us start with the results presented in Figs. 9 and 10. The bottom plots in both

ﬁgures display the frequency dependence of the stack transmittance τ for two diﬀerent

polarizations of incident light . Clearly, in the vicinity of the frozen mode frequency ω0, the

transmittance remains signiﬁcant, which implies that a signiﬁcant portion of the incident

radiation is converted into the frozen mode. The top plots in Figs. 9 and 10 display the

amplitude of the two Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT . The solid and dotted

lines correspond to the propagating and evanescent Bloch components, respectively. In the

vicinity of the frozen mode frequency (at ωa < ω < ωb), there is one propagating component

(Ψpr) and one evanescent component (Ψev), each of which diverges as ω → ω0, in accordance

with Eq. (19). At ω < ωa and ω > ωb, the transmitted wave ΨT is a superposition of two

propagating components with diﬀerent group velocities, which constitutes the phenomenon

of double refraction. The characteristic frequencies in Figs. 9 and 10 are explained in Fig.

6.

Fig. 7 shows the frequency dependence of the resulting ﬁeld amplitude |ΨT (0)|2 at the

slab boundary, along with the amplitudes of its propagating and evanescent components
|Ψpr (0)|2 and |Ψev (0)|2. Although each of the two Bloch contributions to ΨT (0) diverges as

ω → ω0, their superposition ΨT (0) remains ﬁnite, to meet the boundary conditions (46) at

z = 0. As we move further away from the slab boundary, the evanescent component dies out,

while the propagating mode Ψpr (z) remains constant and large. As a result, the destructive
interference of Ψpr (z) and Ψev (z) is removed, and the resulting ﬁeld amplitude |ΨT (z)|2
grows and approaches the value |Ψpr|2. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 8b and 8c. If the

frequency ω of the incident wave and its direction of propagation ~n exactly correspond to

the critical values ω0 and ~n0, then the electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT (z) inside the semi-inﬁnite

21

stack is described by a linearly diverging non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode

|ΨT |2 ∝ z2,

as shown in Fig. 8a.

By way of example, let us present the actual geometrical parameters of the stack sup-

porting the axially frozen mode regime for the case of infrared light with λ = 1550 nm and

the direction of incidence (33). The expression (34) for the frozen mode frequency yield

d = L/2 = 1130.4 nm.

In practice, we do not have to adjust the layer thicknesses in order to achieve the frozen

mode regime at a prescribed wavelength. Instead, we can tune the system into the axially

frozen mode regime by adjusting the direction ~n of light incidence.

IV. APPENDIX. SCATTERING PROBLEM FOR ANISOTROPIC SEMI-

INFINITE STACK

In this section we brieﬂy discuss the standard procedure we use to do the electrodynamics

of stratiﬁed media incorporating anisotropic layers. For more details, see, for example,

[3, 10, 11, 12] and references therein.

A. Time-harmonic Maxwell equations in periodic layered media

Our consideration is based on time-harmonic Maxwell equations

∇ × E (x, y, z) = i

B (x, y, z) , ∇ × H (x, y, z) = −i

D (x, y, z)

(35)

ω
c

with linear constitutive relations

D (x, y, z) = ˆε (z) E (x, y, z) , B (x, y, z) = ˆµ (z) H (x, y, z) .

(36)

In layered media, the tensors ˆε and ˆµ in Eq. (36) depend on a single Cartesian coordinate

z. Plugging Eq. (36) into (35) yields

∇ × E (x, y, z) = i

ˆµ (z) H (x, y, z) , ∇ × H (x, y, z) = −i

ˆε (z) E (x, y, z) .

(37)

ω
c

Solutions for Eq. (37) are sought in the following form

E (x, y, z) = ei(kxx+kyy) ~E (z) , H (x, y, z) = ei(kxx+kyy) ~H (z) ,

(38)

which is a standard choice for the scattering problem of a plane electromagnetic wave incident

on a plane-parallel stratiﬁed slab. Indeed, in such a case, due to the boundary conditions

23

(45), the tangential components (kx, ky) of the wave vector are the same for the incident,

reﬂected and transmitted waves. The substitution (38) in Eq. (37) allows to separate the

tangential ﬁeld components Ex, Ey, Hx, Hy into a closed system of four linear diﬀerential

equations

∂zΨ (z) = i

M (z) Ψ (z) , where Ψ (z) =

The 4 × 4 matrix M (z) is referred to as the Maxwell operator. The reduced Maxwell

equation (39) for the four tangential ﬁeld components Ψ (z) should be complemented with

the following expressions for the normal components of the ﬁelds

where

The expression for the Maxwell operator M (z) is very cumbersome, its explicit form can

be found in [3]. The matrix elements of M (z) depend on the following parameters: the

frequency ω, the direction ~n of light incidence, the material tensors ˆε (z) and ˆµ (z).

In a periodic layered medium

M (z + L) = M (z) ,

where L is the stack period. For any given kx, ky and ω, the system (39) of four ordinary

linear diﬀerential equations with periodic coeﬃcients has four Bloch solutions

Ψki (z + L) = eikiLΨki (z) ,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4

where ki, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to four solutions for kz for given kx, ky and ω

kx, ky, ω ←→ {k1z, k2z, k3z, k4z} = {k∗

1z, k∗

2z, k∗

3z, k∗

4z} .

Real kz in (44) relate to propagating Bloch eigenmodes, while complex kz relate to the

evanescent modes. In the case of propagating eigenmodes, the correspondence between kz

and ω for ﬁxed kx, ky is referred to as the axial dispersion relation, the concise form of which

is given by Eqs. (8) or (9).

The reduced Maxwell equations (39) in periodic layered media are analyzed and solved

using the transfer matrix formalism, the detailed description of which can be found in the

extensive literature on the subject (see, for example, [3, 10, 11, 12] and references therein).

B. Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions at the slab/vacuum interface reduce to the continuity require-

ment for the tangential ﬁeld components at z = 0

(EI (x, y, 0))⊥ + (ER (x, y, 0))⊥ = (ET (x, y, 0))⊥ ,

(HI (x, y, 0))⊥ + (HR (x, y, 0))⊥ = (HT (x, y, 0))⊥ ,

where the indices I, R and T denote the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respec-

tively. Using representation (38), we can recast (45) in a compact form

ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) = ΨT (0)

nents of the unit vector (10).

Knowing the eigenmodes (43) inside the slab and using the boundary conditions (46)

we can express the amplitude and composition of the transmitted wave ΨT and reﬂected

wave ΨR, in terms of the amplitude and polarization of the incident wave ΨI. This gives

us the electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution ΨT (z) inside the layered medium, as well as the

transmittance and reﬂectance coeﬃcients of the semi-inﬁnite slab as functions of the incident

wave polarization, the direction ~n of incidence, and the frequency ω.

C. Energy ﬂux, reﬂectance, transmittance

The real-valued Poynting vector is deﬁned by

Plugging the representation (38) for E (x, y, z) and H (x, y, z) in Eq. (48) yields

~S (x, y, z) =

ℜ [E∗ (x, y, z) × H (x, y, z)] .

~S (x, y, z) = ~S (z) =

,

implying that none of the three Cartesian components of the energy density ﬂux ~S depends

on the tangential coordinates x and y. In addition, the energy conservation argument implies

that the axial component Sz of the energy ﬂux does not depend on the coordinate z either

Sz (x, y, z) = Sz = const, Sx (x, y, z) = Sx (z) , Sy (x, y, z) = Sy (z) .

(50)

This only apply to the case of a plane monochromatic wave incident on a lossless layered

medium. The explicit expression for the z component of the energy ﬂux (49) is

Sz =

(cid:3)

Let us turn to the scattering problem for semi-inﬁnite slab. Let ~SI, ~SR and ~ST be the

Poynting vectors of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively. The energy

conservation imposes the following relation between the normal components of these three

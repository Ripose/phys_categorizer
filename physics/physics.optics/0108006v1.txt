A report on results of an electromagnetic experiment claims that it demon-
strates a superluminal speed of an electromagnetic signal propagating in
air[1]. The experiment relies on the idea that a localized diﬀraction-free
electromagnetic wave can be created[2]. The radiation takes the form of
a cylindrically symmetric (ϕ-invariant) wave where the r-dependence is as-
sumed to be proportional to the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind J0. Refer-
ence [2] has arisen a great interest in utilization of J0 waves and has been
cited more than 340 times. Related publication supporting the claims of
[1] have been published[3-7]. Discussions of these papers and objections to
the interpretations of the experimental results have already been published
too[8-10]. The main purpose of this work is to show that one cannot con-
struct a diﬀraction-free localized electromagnetic beam whose ﬁelds do not
depend on the cylindrical coordinate ϕ. This outcome proves that results
of papers discussing this topic, in general, and those ascribing superluminal
velocity to beams that take the form of Bessel function J0, in particular,
should be reevaluated. Speciﬁc properties of the experiment reported in [1]
are discussed ﬁrst. Later, some more general properties of electromagnetic
radiation are examined. In this work, units where the speed of light c = 1
are used.

The experiment reported in [1] uses a cylindrically symmetric device
where electromagnetic radiation of λ = 3.5 cm is investigated. The radi-
ation is emitted from a horn antenna, passes through a circular slit which is
placed in the (x, y) plane and its center is on the z-axis. After passing the
slit, the wave is reﬂected from a spherical mirror whose axis coincides with
the z-axis and the circular slit is placed at its focal plane. The electromag-
netic wave is detected by a device lying on the z-axis. The cornerstone of [1]
is the following relation representing the electromagnetic wave. It is written
in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z)

J0(ρk sin θ)exp[i(kz cos θ − ωt)],

(1)

where J0 is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind, k = ω/c is the
wave number and θ is a parameter. (In what follows, Cartesian or cylindrical
coordinates are used, as required.) As stated in [1], expression ( 1) is ϕ-
invariant.

The following argument proves that (1) cannot describe cylindrically sym-
metric electromagnetic radiation as created in the experiment described in
[1]. Indeed, in order not to destroy the ϕ-invariance, the antenna must be
placed on the z-axis and parallel to it. Thus, the entire device used in [1] is
invariant under a rotation around the z-axis. Hence, all vectors perpendic-
ular to this axis which are associated with points lying on it, must vanish.
Now, in electromagnetic radiation, electric and magnetic ﬁelds are perpen-
dicular to the direction of propagation[11,12]. Thus, the electric ﬁeld E and
the magnetic ﬁeld B vanish on the z-axis

E(ρ = 0) = 0; B(ρ = 0) = 0.

Therefore, the Poynting vector, representing the electromagnetic energy cur-
rent ([11],[12], p. 237) vanishes too

(2)

(3)

This argument proves that on the z-axis all ﬁelds interfere destructively.
Hence, electromagnetic properties of the experiment cannot be represented

S(ρ = 0) =

E × B = 0.

by ( 1), because on the z-axis ρ = 0 but J0(0) = 1[13]. Using continuity
properties of solutions of Maxwell equations in the vacuum, one infers that
electromagnetic ﬁelds near the z-axis are small and that the variation from
a destructive interference to a constructive one depends on the wave length
λ and on geometrical properties of the experiment.

On the other hand, if, in the experiment reported in [1], the horn antenna
emitting the radiation is perpendicular to the z-axis then the radiation is not
ϕ-invariant(see [12], pp. 401-403, 763-767), contrary to what is reported in
[1].

Let us turn to the general case and prove the following theorem.

Theorem: One cannot create a diﬀraction-free localized electromagnetic beam
where the intensity of the ﬁelds does not depend on the cylindrical coordinate
ϕ.
Proof: Let us examine a diﬀraction-free electromagnetic radiation propagat-
ing parallel to the z-axis and assume that the ﬁelds do not depend on the
cylindrical coordinate ϕ. As explained above, the z-components of the elec-
tric and the magnetic ﬁeld vanish. Hence, the following Maxwell equation in
the vacuum takes the form

∇ · E =

∂Ex
∂x

+

∂Ey
∂y

= 0.

Let us examine this equation at a point P1 = (x 6= 0, 0, 0). Using the
assumed ϕ-invariance of the ﬁeld components and the following expression
for the cylindrical coordinate ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2, one obtains from (4)

∂Ex
∂ρ

x
(x2 + y2)1/2 +

∂Ey
∂ρ

y

(x2 + y2)1/2 = 0.

Now, at point P1, y = 0 and x 6= 0. Hence

Examining the system at another point P2 = (0, y 6= 0, 0), which lies on

the y-axis, one obtains from a similar procedure

(7)

Results (6) and (7) hold for all values of ρ, except ρ = 0. Continuity
properties of the derivative of the ﬁeld components in vacuum prove that (6)
and (7) hold for ρ = 0 too. The null derivative of the electric ﬁeld components
means that they equal a constant in the entire (x, y) plane. It can be shown
analogously that the magnetic ﬁeld B shares the same properties.

This analysis proves that if the radiation is diﬀraction-free and ϕ-invariant
then the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds are uniform on the entire (x, y)
plane. Hence, the radiation is the well known plane wave (see [11], pp. 110-
112, [12], pp. 269-273), which is not localized (because it does not vanish for
x = ∞, y = ∞). This conclusion completes the proof.

It follows from this theorem that electromagnetic ﬁelds cannot take the

diﬀraction-free form of the Bessel function (1).

The results obtained above deserve a further discussion. It is well known
that, in the vacuum, Maxwell equations yield the homogeneous wave equa-
tion for components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Some authors obtain the
homogeneous wave equation for the ﬁeld components directly from Maxwell
equations in the vacuum[14,15]. Hence, satisfying the homogeneous wave
equation is a necessary condition for being consistent with Maxwell equation
in the vacuum. At this point, the problem whether the condition is suﬃcient
is not yet decided.

This issue can be treated alternatively (see [11], pp. 108-109, [12], pp.
219-220, [14], p. 67, [15] pp. 313-314 and [16,17]). Indeed, an analysis of
the 4-potentials Aµ = (Φ, A) proves that Maxwell equations are equivalent
to the inhomogeneous wave equations

provided the Lorentz gauge

2Aµ = 4πjµ,

∂Φ
∂t

+ ∇ · A = 0

holds. This outcome indicates that satisfying the wave equation alone is not
suﬃcient for being consistent with Maxwell equations.

As a matter of fact, it can be proved in a very simple way that vector ﬁelds
whose components satisfy the homogeneous wave equation in the vacuum do
not necessarily satisfy Maxwell equation. Indeed, assume that each of the
vector ﬁeld components (Ex, Ey, Ez) satisﬁes in the vacuum the homogeneous
wave equation

2Ex = 0; 2Ey = 0; 2Ez = 0.
(10)
Now, not all ﬁeld components vanish throughout the entire space. Let Ex
be nonzero in a certain region. As a physical ﬁeld, it vanishes at inﬁnity.
Therefore, Ex is not a uniform function of x and its derivative is nonzero
somewhere

Due to Maxwell equation in the vacuum

one must have at this region

∂Ex
∂x

= f (x, y, z) 6= 0.

∇ · E = 0,

∂Ey
∂y

+

∂Ez
∂z

= −f (x, y, z).

This result provides an example of ﬁeld components (Ex, Ey, Ez) that sat-
isfy the homogeneous wave equation ( 10) and Maxwell equation ( 12) as
well. However, one may use another system of ﬁelds whose components are
(2Ex, Ey, Ez). Here, Ex of the previous system is multiplied by 2. Obviously,
the new ﬁeld components do satisfy the homogeneous wave equation (10) but
violate Maxwell equation (12). This conclusion completes the proof.

The quantities (Ex, Ey, Ez) used above may represent the electric ﬁeld as

well as the magnetic one.

This work shows the signiﬁcance of the Lorentz gauge (9) constraint which
is imposed on the 4-potentials (Φ, A) which are solutions of the wave equa-
In particular, one should not accept automatically ﬁeld components

that solve the homogeneous wave equation in the vacuum as solutions of
Maxwell equations. An outcome of the discussion carried out here is that
the Bessel function (1) suggested in [2] and used in [1] for an apparent demon-
stration of superluminal properties of electromagnetic radiation contains a
fundamental error because it is just a special case of a localized diﬀraction-
free ϕ-invariant beam. Therefore, results of theoretical and experimental
works[1-9] relying on (1) should be reevaluated. Obviously, special care must
be taken in an evaluation of claims concerning the existence of superluminal
properties of electromagnetic radiation, a claim which is inconsistent with
special relativity and Maxwellian electrodynamics in the vacuum.

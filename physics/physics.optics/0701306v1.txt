Abstract

Self-compression of femtosecond laser pulses and more than an order of magnitude increase of
the peak intensity is found in a positive dispersion medium in low dispersion regime based on the
(3+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. A method of high-intensity femtosecond pulse
formation can be developed on that basis.

The propagation of high-intensity femtosecond optical pulses in bulk nonlinear medium has at-
tracted considerable attention since their generation became a mature technology. The rigorous analy-
sis of the pulse propagation is based on the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE),
in which diﬀraction, group velocity dispersion (GVD) of second order, and Kerr nonlinearity of third
order form a basic set of optical processes [1, 2, 3, 4] capable to describe a broad range of realistic
conditions. Additional terms in the NLSE are required to describe some particular features of the
pulse propagation and ionization [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The NLSE predicts diﬀerent pulse behavior depending
on the physical conditions, but some general features can be outlined. Thus, at negative GVD, simul-
taneous collapse of the pulse in space and time and formation of a spatiotemporal soliton is predicted1.
In the more common case of positive GVD, however, the theoretical studies predict time broadening
and splitting of the pulse [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In a single study, initial pulse shortening is found while
evidences from the conducted experiments are not shown [4]. A time shortening at self-focusing is
known for nanosecond pulses [10], where, however, the GVD plays a negligible role and has not been
considered in the propagation equation [11]. Such a nanosecond result cannot be directly extrapolated
to the femtosecond pulses, for which the dispersion plays a crucial role. Self-compression (SC), before
splitting, of high-intensity femtosecond laser pulses at positive GVD has been found experimentally
in pure atomic and molecular gases [12]. SC was also observed in air [8], highly ionized low pressure
argon [13], and BK-7 glass in presence of ionization using negatively chirped pulses [14].

The pulse splitting is an important part of the femtosecond pulse dynamics and much attention
was paid to its theoretical and experimental study [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. From the other side, while the SC is
very interesting from a theoretical and experimental point of view, there is little knowledge about the
set of processes and range of conditions at which SC may occur. Two cases can be well distinguished in
the pulse propagation studies: relatively low-intensity pulses propagating in relatively high-dispersion
media (fused silica, BK-7 glass) [3, 4, 5, 6], and relatively high-intensity pulses (creating signiﬁcant
ionization) propagating in relatively low-dispersion media (low or high pressure gases) [7, 8, 9, 12, 13].
In this Letter we focus on the not yet fully explored case of high-intensity femtosecond pulse propagation
in a positive GVD medium in a low dispersion regime and negligible ionization. A minimal set of
processes in the NLSE, suﬃcient to trigger the SC, is determined. More than two times of SC and
more than an order of magnitude increase of the peak intensity are found.

The pulse propagation along z-direction including diﬀraction, GVD of second order and Kerr
nonlinearity of third order is described by the NLSE for the complex ﬁeld amplitude ˜E(r, z, τ ) (in

where standard notations are used [4]. The ﬁeld is normalized such that I = | ˜E|2 is the intensity. The
nonlinear medium is pressurized argon of nonlinear refractive index of n2 = 9.8 × 10−20 P cm2/W,
GVD of β2 = 0.2 P fs2/cm, and P is the pressure in atm. The initial pulse, tuned at 800 nm,
is a linearly polarized chirp-free Gaussian in space and time of axial symmetry, ˜E(r, z = 0, τ ) =

intensity proﬁle and W0 = 0.3 mJ energy.

The propagation equation (1) does not include irreversible losses and non-instantaneous processes.
Among these, the ionization has very important role as it strongly modiﬁes the material parameters
and thus, the pulse propagation, and, being a highly nonlinear process, is very diﬃcult to be controlled.
Avoiding the ionization of the medium can be achieved reducing the input pulse energy so that the
peak intensity, increased by the self-focusing, does not reach the ionization “threshold” while the

self-focusing is arrested by the diﬀraction and the temporal splitting. As our simulations show, at
W0 = 0.3 mJ and P = 15 atm, the peak intensity does not exceed 1013 W/cm2 throughout the
propagation distance. This is below the ionization “threshold” at which non-negligible ionization of
Ar occurs[9]. Also, according to the experiment [15], 1013 W/cm2 is less than the appearance intensity
at which single argon ion is detected for 8-photon ionization at 586 nm, and it holds even better
for 11-photon nonresonant ionization at 800 nm, as in our case. Finally, the atomic medium does
not exhibit in practice non-instantaneous properties [5, 6]. Thus, the propagation equation (1) is
appropriate to describe the behavior of the femtosecond pulses at the speciﬁed conditions. Such pulses
can be routinely generated by the conventional oscillator-chirped pulse ampliﬁer Titan:Sapphire laser
systems.

The lack of substantial losses means the condition for conservation of the pulse energy W (z) holds,

i.e.,

W (z) =

| ˜E(r, z, τ )|2dsdτ = W0 = const,

where the integration is taken over the transversal cross-section s and the local time τ of the pulse.
This resembles the normalization condition of the quantum mechanical wave function, while here Eq.(2)
plays role of normalization condition of the ﬁeld amplitude. This allows to control the absolute value
of the ﬁeld strength and the pulse intensity.

The NLSE is solved numerically for the speciﬁed initial conditions by using a split-step method on
a two-dimensional grid (in a polar coordinate system) of 200 transversal grid nodes and 100 temporal
nodes. The evolution of the transversal pulse width 2r0 (FWHM at τ = 0 plane), the normalized
peak intensity |E0(r = 0, z, τ = 0)/E0(r = 0, z = 0, τ = 0)|2, and the pulse duration τ0 (FWHM) of
the intensity proﬁle versus the propagation distance z at P = 15 atm of argon pressure is shown in

Figure 2: The spatiotemporal shape of the input pulse (a), the compressed pulse at z = zSC (b), and
the split pulse at z = 0.516 m (c).

Figures 1(a), (b), (c), respectively. The pulse rearrangement begins with a self-focusing. This conﬁnes
the pulse in the transversal direction reaching minimal width at z = zSF = 0.378 m, Figure 1(a). The
self-focusing results in an increase of the peak intensity, Figure 1(b), and, what is nontrivial, SC of the
pulse in time before splitting, Figure 1(c). The evolution of the spatiotemporal pulse shape is shown
in Figure 2. As can be seen, a strongly compressed single pulse of increased intensity is formed. The
space and time intensity proﬁles at the position of maximum SC are shown in Figures 3(a) and (b),
respectively. The position of the maximum self-compression zSC = 0.344 m is close to the positions of
maximal intensity gain, zIG = 0.367 m, Figure 1. This is very important for the practical application
as it allows taking advantage from both the SC (more than 2 times at zSC) and the intensity gain

(more than 15 times at zIG). If zSC is at the end of the medium, a strongly compressed and ampliﬁed
in intensity single pulse will be generated, which carries almost all of the input pulse energy. The
propagation of the pulse beyond zIG leads to the usual pulse splitting, Figure 2(c), which results in
rapid fall of the peak intensity at τ = 0, Figure 1(b). The magnitude of the time compression and the
intensity gain as well as the position of the strongest time “focusing” zSC and the intensity gain zIG,
can be controlled by the pulse (e.g., energy) and the medium (pressure) parameters.

A general explanation of the SC in this case (aside of the numerical simulations) can be done based
on the energy conservation condition, Eq.(2). This imposes conservation of the four-dimensional “vol-
ume”, as the pulse energy W can be considered, which is distributed in the two transversal directions
(the cross-section of the pulse), the longitudinal direction (the local time), and the “vertical” direction
(the intensity | ˜E|2). The self-focusing conﬁnes the pulse toward the longitudinal axis, r = 0. The
conservation of the energy/“volume” requires an expanding in the rest two directions, the intensity

and the time duration ones. Due to the low dispersion of the argon gas, the pulse energy does not
substantially spread in time (along a given distance), while the strong increase of the pulse intensity
(more than 15 times, Figure 1(b)) results in an eﬀective, but real, shortening of the pulse, based on the
FWHM characterization. To verify the importance of the GVD for the SC, the pulse propagation has
been simulated in a hypothetical medium of increased GVD, keeping the other parameters constant.
Thus, if GVD exceeds 1.95 fs2/cm, no SC takes place while continuous time broadening and splitting
the pulse is observed, because the increased GVD speeds up the time expansion and the splitting of
the pulse and SC cannot be achieved. To the best of our knowledge, such a concept of femtosecond
pulse compression is formulated for the ﬁrst time and will be called self-compression in low dispersion
regime. It is based on a geometrical rearrangement of a pulse of almost constant energy. An experi-
mental method of pulse compression and intensity gain can be developed providing the ionization (and
other losses) is negligible. It can be scaled up to much higher intensity/energy pulses using medium of
higher ionization potential, e.g., Ne or He. Keldysh adiabatic parameter [15] can be used as a scaling
parameter providing similar ionization condition as in Ar.

The general propagation properties of the pulse up to the stage of maximum SC in these simulations
well matches the experimentally observed behavior in pressurized argon, see Figure 1(b) in Ref.[12] and
Figure 2 in Ref.[16]. From the other side, the higher pulse energy used in these experiments results in
peak intensity at maximum SC as high as 5 × 1013 W/cm2 or more, and the ionization and above-cubic
nonlinear eﬀects are no more negligible [9]. The experimentally observed stabilization of the pulse
shape, once the SC is achieved, can be attributed namely to such additional processes [12, 16].

In conclusion, self-compression of high intensity femtosecond pulses is found as a result of the
interplay of the diﬀraction, group velocity dispersion of second order and Kerr nonlinearity of third
order in a low dispersion regime. These three processes are suﬃcient to trigger the self-compression
in a positive GVD medium in low dispersion, while additional mechanism is required for a stable
propagation of the compressed pulse. A method of pulse compression and intensity gain of high-
intensity femtosecond laser pulses below the ionization “threshold” can be developed on that basis.

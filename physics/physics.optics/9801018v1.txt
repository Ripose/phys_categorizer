Abstract

The concept of broken symmetry is used to study bifurcations of equilibria and dy-
namical instabilities in dynamic model of one-mode laser (nonresonant complex Lorenz
model) on the basis of modiﬁed Hopf theory. It is shown that an invariant set of stationary
points bifurcates into an invariant torus (doubly-periodic branching solution). Inﬂuence
of the symmetry breaking on stability of branching solutions is investigated as a function
of detuning. The invariant torus is found to be stable under the detuning exceeds its
critical value, so that dynamically broken symmetry results in the appearance of low fre-
quency Goldstone-type mode. If the detuning then goes downward and pumping is kept
above the threshold, numerical analysis reveals that after a cascade of period-doublings
the strange Lorenz attractor is formed at small values of detuning. It is found that there
are three diﬀerent types of the system behaviour as pumping increases depending on the
detuning. Quantum counterpart of the complex Lorenz model is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear dynamics of laser systems, especially, those that exhibit so-called chaotic behavior has
been the subject of major interest during the last two decades (see, for example, [1, 2]). In the
semiclassical approximation, when quantum correlation eﬀects are disregarded, description of
dynamical instabilities in lasers is shown to be closely related to the theory of nonequilibrium
phase transitions in dissipative dynamical systems [3]. From this standpoint, of particular
interest are the systems that can be reduced to the well-known models of the dynamical system
˙Y = rX − Y +
theory. One of the models is the famous Lorenz equations:
˙Z = −bZ − XY that were originally derived in [4] and have been studied intensively from
XZ,
the end of the seventies (see, for example, [5-9] and references therein). The above system (in
what follows it will be referred as the real Lorenz model for X(t), Y (t) and Z(t) are real-valued
functions) was obtained from a set of hydrodynamic equations in the three-mode approximation
to describe the convective motion of a layer of ﬂuid that is warmer at the bottom than at the
top, so that σ is the Prandtl number; r (controlling parameter) is the Rayleigh number and
is proportional to the temperature diﬀerence; b depends on geometrical properties of the ﬂuid
layer.

˙X = σ(−X + Y ),

In order to clarify the relevance of Lorenz-type models to laser physics let us consider

the simplest one-mode laser equations taken in the following form [10]:

˙b = −(κ + iω) · b − ig · α
˙α = −(γ + iωa) · α + ig · b · S
˙S = (d0 − S)/T − 4g · ℑ(α · b)






(1)

where b is the dimensionless complex amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld mode; ω
(κ) is the frequency (the relaxation constant) of the mode; α is the dimensionless transition
dipole matrix element; S is the inversion of the atomic level populations; ωa is the frequency
of the atomic transition; d0 is the parameter characterizing the intensity of pumping; g is the
coupling constant; γ (T −1) is the transverse (longitudinal) relaxation constant.

Eq.(1) is derived within the framework of semiclassical approach to dymanics of the
system that constitutes a number of two-level atoms (atomic subsystem) interacting with the
one mode of electromagnetic ﬁeld (ﬁeld subsystem), so that b is the averaged ﬁeld anihilation
operator descriptive of the coherent part of radiation. Note that the equations can be obtained
from Heisenberg operator equations for Dicke-type hamiltonian taken in the rotating wave
approximation after neglecting of quantum ﬂuctuations and assuming no dependence on spatial
variables [10, 11]. In addition, the result should be supplemented with the relaxation terms
as well as the term proportional to the intensity of pumping (see Sec. 5 for more details on
quantum models behind Eq.(1)).

After making the substitutions:

t → γt, b = γX/(2g), α = iS0Y /2, S = d0 + S0Z, S0 = γκ/g2

and going over to the representation of interaction the system (1) can be rewritten as a complex
Lorenz model [12]:

2

˙X = σ(−(1 + i∆) · X + Y )
˙Y = −(1 − i∆) · Y + r · X + X · Z
˙Z = −b · Z − ℜ(X · Y )






(2)

where σ = κ/γ, r = d0/S0, b = (γT )−1, ∆ = (ωa − ω)/(κ + γ) is the frequency detuning.
Note that X(t) and Y (t) are complex-valued functions, so that the system (2) consists of ﬁve
real equations.

In the case of exact resonance when ∆ = 0, though the complex Lorenz model is appeared
to diﬀer from the real one in some respects, it was shown that basically there is no diﬀerence
between dynamics of the system (2) and one of the real Lorenz model [12].

In this paper our main purpose is to study detuning induced eﬀects in dynamics of the
complex Lorenz model on the basis of bifurcation analysis. The latter means that we deal with
stability and existence of certain branching solutions depending on the intensity of pumping. In
other words, r is assumed to be a control parameter. By contrast to the real Lorenz model,the
system (2) has a continuous symmetry group (Lie group of rotations in complex planes), so
that we approach the problem within the uniﬁed concept of symmetry breaking.
It should
be emphasized that the reason behind all qualitatively new eﬀects discussed in the paper is
precisely the symmetry and ∆ can be served as a quantity to measure inﬂuence of dynamically
broken symmetry on bifurcating solutions and their stability.

In order to discuss the eﬀects in more speciﬁc terms, let us outline some relevant results

for the real Lorenz model (most of them hold at ∆ = 0).

As a preliminary we comment on stability and bifurcations of equilibria (steady states).
The null steady state corresponding to the spontaneous emission regime (no coherent radiation)
is given by X = Y = Z = 0 and is asymptotically stable at r < r0 = 1. This solution
loses its stability at r = r0 and there are two asymptotically stable bifurcating steady states
X = Y = ±
b(r − 1), Z = r − 1 provided that r > r0. At this stage we have the stationary
points bifurcated from the origin at r = r0 indicating that the regime of spontaneous emission
is changed to the initiation of laser generation (convective ﬂow for the problem of [4]). This
bifurcation produces qualitative changes in phase portrait of the system. The analogy between
transformation of such kind, that can be regarded as a nonequilibrium phase transition, and
a second order phase transition in thermodynamic systems led to the synergetic concept of a
phase transition [13].

q

If σ > b+1, there is another critical value of the control parameter r: rc =

such that the above two stationary points become exponentially unstable at r > rc. Note that
the linearized operator governing stability of the solutions in question (Liapunov’s ﬁrst theorem)
has a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with negative real parts in the neighborhood of
rc. These eigenvalues are pure imaginary at r = rc. According to the Hopf bifurcation theory
[7], it follows that a new branching time periodic solution can be expected to appear (Hopf
bifurcation). Stability of this solution is determined by the Floquet exponents: the solution is
stable (unstable) if it appears supercritically (subcritically). In the case under consideration
the bifurcation was found to be subcritical [14]. It implies that the time periodic solution is
unstable when the pumping exceeded its critical value given by rc.

One of the most striking features of the real Lorenz model is the appearance of so-
called strange Lorenz attractor instantaneously on passing the control parameter r through its
critical value rc (”drastic” route to chaos). The term ’strange attractor’(or ’chaotic attractor’) is
commonly used for an attracting set that has a rather complicated structure and each trajectory
within the attractor is exponentially unstable. There is a number of diﬀerent quantities to
measure the complexity (stochasticity) of the attractor structure: capacity (fractal dimension),
information dimension, Hausdorﬀ and Liapunov (Kaplan-Yorke formula) dimensions, K-entropy
and so on.

Detailed description of how the strange Lorenz attractor forms is beyond the scope of
this paper. In brief, this can be understood as being due to the occurrence of a homoclinic orbit
in the system: as r passes through the value at which the homoclinic ’explosion’ takes place, a
strange invariant set of trajectories is produced, including an inﬁnite number of periodic orbit
[5, 8, 9]. Note that, in addition, the real Lorenz model is known to exhibit period-doubling
[15], intermittency [16] and hysteresis [17] in various ranges of its parameter space.

The paper is organised as follows:
In Sec. 2 it is shown that due to the symmetry the null equilibrium state of the complex
Lorenz model (spontaneous emission) bifurcate into an invariant set of stationary points at
r = r0 = 1 + ∆2. Stability of the equilibrium states is studied as a function of detuning. It
is found that under σ > b + 1 there is a critical value of the control parameter r (pumping
intensity), rc, such that the states of the invariant set become exponentially unstable at r > rc
and rc is an increasing function of ∆2.

In Sec. 3 analytical power series Hopf technique is extended on the system invariant
under the action of a continuous symmetry group to construct bifurcating solutions and to
investigate their stability in the vicinity of r = rc at ∆ 6= 0. Due to the symmetry breaking the
bifurating solution is appeared to be doubly-periodic at ∆ 6= 0. It means that nonzero detuning
results in the appearance of low-frequency Goldstone-type mode related to the motion along an
orbit of the group. Moreover, the broken symmetry is found to aﬀect stability of the branching
solution.

In Sec. 4 the results of numerical analysis are discussed. Dependence of the relevant
Floquet exponent on ∆ is calculated. It is obtained that there is a critical detuning, ∆c, such
that the bifurcating doubly- periodic solution is stable at |∆| > ∆c. It leads to the formation
of stable invariant torus. Diﬀerent routes to chaos depending on the detuning are duscussed.

Concluding remarks and discussion are given in Sec. 5. Bosonic three-oscillator quantum
system that gives the complex Lorenz model in the semiclassical approximation (quantum
counterpart) is formulated.

2 SYMMETRY OF THE PROBLEM: STABILITY AND

BIFURCATIONS OF EQUILIBRIA

Taking r as a bifurcation (control) parameter, Eq.(2) can be rewritten as an autonoumous
dynamical system with quadratic nonlinearity:

˙x = f(x) = L x + f2(x, x)

(3)

where

x = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), X = x1 + ix2, Y = x3 + ix4, Z = x5,

L = Df(0) (Lij =

(0)); f i

2(x, y) =

∂fi
∂xj

∂2fi
∂xn∂xm

Xn,m

· xn · ym

Clearly, the system (2) is invariant under the transformations:

X → exp(iφ) · X, Y → exp(iφ) · Y, Z → Z,

so that Eq.(3) has a continuous symmetry group G of rotations in the x1 − x2 and x3 − x4
planes, G ∼ SU(1):

f(T (φ) · x) = T (φ) · f(x), T (φ) ∈ G

Note that there is an additional discrete symmetry in the complex Lorenz model:

Y → X, Y → Y , Z → Z, ∆ → −∆ .

The latter implies no dependence on the sign of detuning. For brevity, in what follows ∆ is
assumed to be nonnegative.

Eq.(4) gives

f(T (φ) · xst) = 0 ⇒ |Df(xst)| = 0,

where xst is a noninvariant equilibrium solution to Eq.(3) and its orbit, T (φ) · xst, produces
an invariant set of equilibria. The second equation in (5) is obtained by diﬀerentiating the
ﬁrst one with respect to φ. Along this line we come to the conclusion that matrix of the
ﬁrst approximation, that govern linearized stability of xst, is degenerate and its null vector is

e0 = K · xst, where K =

T (φ)|φ=0 is the generator of G.

It can be readily shown that the null stationary point related to the regime of spontaneous

emission loses its stability after the pumping intensity exceeded its critical value

and the solution bifurcated from the origin can be taken in the form

According to Eq.(5), the stationary point (7) provides an invariant set of the steady states
corresponding to the appearance of coherent light emission (laser generation).
In the ﬁrst
approximation stability of the state (7) is determined by eigenvalues of the following matrix:

Df(xst) = Lc =

As it can be seen from Eq.(5), |Lc| = 0 and the kernel of Lc is deﬁned by the null vector
e0 = (0, 1, −∆, 1, 0). Strictly speaking, we cannot conclude on stability of stationary point in
the ﬁrst approximation for one of the eigenvalues is zero. So the underlying arguments need
to be modiﬁed. Obviously, since there is another steady state in any neighborhood of a given
steady state on the orbit, it cannot enjoy the property of being asymptotically stable. Suppose
that all other four eigenvalues have negative real parts and sketch a way how stability of the
invariant set can be studied on the basis of symmetry arguments. First, the set is asymptotically
stable if

kx(t) − T (ψ(t))xstk → 0 , t → ∞

(9)

where x(t) is a solution of Eq.(3) with initial conditions taken in the vicinity of a sta-

tionary point; ψ(t) is determined from the condition

kx(t) − T (ψ(t))xstk → min

at given t, so that the left hand side of Eq.(9) deﬁnes the distance from x(t) to the invariant
set. The latter can be written in the form:

z(t) = T (−ψ(t))x(t) ⊥ e0

(10)

From Eqs(3, 10) it is not diﬃcult to obtain the equation for z(t) and to derive the expres-
˙ψ(t). Then the motion along the orbit can be eliminated from the consideration and
sion for
subsequent analysis of the modiﬁed system can be made in the ﬁrst approximation. Following
this line we arrive at the conclusion that the invariant set is asymptotically stable in the case
under investigation. Some rather straightforward algebra on the subject was made in [18] for
∆ = 0.

If σ > b + 1 (this condition is found to be independent of ∆), there is a critical value of
the bifurcation parameter, such that the solution in question is unstable at r > rc and Lc has
a pair of complex conjugate imaginary eigenvalues λ1 = λ2 = iα at r = rc. Equations for rc
and α can be derived by making use of Routh-Hurwitz criteria:

p1p2p3 = p2
1 + p0p2

p1
α2 =

p3

where pi are coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial:

p0 = 2σb(1 + σ)(r − 1 − ∆2)
p1 = b((1 + ∆2)σ2 + 3σ(r − 2) + r)
p2 = (σ + 1)2 + 1 + r + 2σ + ∆2((σ − 1)2 − b)
p3 = 2σ + b + 2.

Dependence of the ratio rc and r0 on detuning is presented in Fig. 1 at b = 1 for σ = 3

(solid line) and σ = 5 (dashed line). It is seen that rc is an increasing function of ∆.

In addition, it can be obtained that ℜ(

λ1|r=rc) > 0 and then, if not symmetry induced

degeneracy of Lc, we could meet all conditions for the occurence of the Hopf bifurcation.

3 HOPF-TYPE BIFURCATION

There are diﬀerent techniques to investigate Hopf bifurcations and stability of bifurcating time
In this section we adopt the perturbative method, closely related to
periodic solutions [7].
the analytical technique by Hopf, to explicitly construct the bifurcating solution in the form of
power series over small parameter ǫ characterizing amplitude of the solution in the neighborhood
of the bifurcation point r = rc [7, 19]. Coeﬃcients of the power series can be derived by making
use of Fredholm alternative and linearized stability of the solution, determined by the Floquet
exponents, can be studied on the basis of the factorization theorem [20].

In trying to make analysis along the above line we need to modify the method to bypass
mathematical diﬃculties arising from the degeneracy of Lc. To avoid equations that have no
solutions it is assumed that the symmetry is ’spontaneously’ broken and the bifurcating solution
is taken in the form:

x = T (ǫθ) · u(t) = T (ǫθ) · (xst + ǫ · z(t))

Substitution of Eq.(17) in Eq.(3) gives the equation for u(t) :

˙u + ǫ · Ku = f(u)

Let us introduce the renormalized frequency Ω(ǫ) = α/(1 + τ (ǫ)), so that z(s) = z(Ωt)

is a 2π-periodic vector-valued function. The equation for z(s) reads

α · ( ˙z + ˙θ · (e0 + ǫ · K · z)) = (1 + τ ) · (Lc z + ǫ f2(z, z))

where Lc is deﬁned by Eq.(8) and the dot stands for the derivative with respect to s.

The 2π-periodic solution of Eq.(19) can be found in the form of power series in ǫ:

At this stage we get the modiﬁcation of the Hopf theory with allowance for the symmetry
breaking, so that bifurcating solution is appeared to be doubly periodic. In other words, there
are two types of frequencies: the basic frequency Ω and the Goldstone-type low frequency mode
with ǫ ˙θ ∼ ∆2. (The latter can be inferred from Eq.(32).) It is of interest to note that another
distinctive feature of the above results is the last term of Eq.(35). This term, being geometrical
in nature, is accounted for the broken symmetry and will be shown to be of importance to
stability analysis.

In the Hopf theory conclusion on stability of the bifurcating solution can be drawn
from Eqs.(34, 35) based on the factorization theorem [7, 19, 20] that states about the stability
depending on the sign of ℜ(k):
if ℜ(k) < 0, then bifurcation is supercritical and the time
periodic branching solution is stable at q > qc; if ℜ(k) > 0 the solution appears subcritically.

Note that the factorization theorem should be extended to system invariant under the
action of a Lie symmetry group. For the system under consideration the theorem can be
recovered by making use ansatz that looks like (17) and real part of the relevant Floquet
exponent is proportional to ℜ(k). More details on the subject is given in [21].

As a result, Eqs.(34, 35) are key equations for making conclusion on stability of the
bifurcating invariant torus. In particular, it implies that the torus is stable at r > rc under
ℜ(k) < 0.

4 NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the previous section we have studied how symmetry of the system aﬀects Hopf-type bifur-
cation at r = rc. Our ﬁndings are:

1. An invariant set of equilibria bifurcates into an invariant torus.

In other words, the
branching solution is time doubly-periodic, so that Goldstone-type low frequency mode
is found to appear due to the symmetry breaking.

9

2. It is found that the sign of ℜ(k) with k deﬁned by Eq.(35) determines stability of the
torus. The last symmetry induced term in Eq.(35) implies that the broken symmetry
aﬀects stability of the branching solution.

Note that the frequency of the Goldstone-type mode as well as the last term of Eq.(35) tend
to zero as ∆ → 0.

In Fig. 2 are shown dependencies of ℜ(k) on detuning (∆) for σ = 5 (solid line) and σ =
10 (dashed line) at b = 1. It is seen that in both cases there is a critical detuning, ∆c, at which
ℜ(k) changes its sign, so that bifurcation being subcritical at ∆ < ∆c becomes supercritical at
∆ > ∆c. The latter means that an invariant set of equilibria Eq.(7), corresponding to the laser
generation, bifurcates into the stable torus as r passes through rc under ∆ > ∆c.

To get some idea of qualitative changes of attractor structure in relation to detuning,
there are three trajectories in 3D ℜ(X) − ℜ(Y ) − Z space in Figs. 3-5 presented at σ = 5, b = 1
and r = rc + 0.2 for various values of ∆. Fig. 3 is clearly revealed the attractor as an invariant
torus at ∆ = 0.5 > ∆c ≈ 0.41, whereas we have the well-known Lorenz attractor under ∆ = 0
(Fig. 5). As is shown in Fig. 4, the intermediate case of ∆ = 0.1 corresponds to an entangled
structure which is hard to interpret.

One of the ways to clarify the point is to look at the relevant Fourier spectra. To this
end, the Fourier spectra |X(ω)| and |Z(ω)| are calculated at ∆ = 0.5 (Fig. 6) and ∆ = 0.1
(Fig. 7). Notice that |X(ω)|2 is proportional to the power spectrum of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld.

The Fourier spectrum |X(ω)| for ∆ = 0.5, depicted in Fig. 3, indicates the high frequency
peak at ω ≈ α = 5.5 and the two intensive low frequency peaks at ω = 0 and ω ≈ 0.04. Since
the frequency ω ≈ 0.04 does not contribute to the spectrum |Z(ω)|, this peak can be attributed
to the Goldstone-type mode. So, the numerical results are in agreement with ones obtained
from the theoretical analysis of Sec. 3. As far as numerical analysis is concerned, it should be
emphasized that, working with relatively small number of points (less than 20000), we are not
to present the results of high precision calculations, but our calculations has been made with
reasonable accuracy for investigation of the theoretical predictions qualitatively.

Coming back to Fig. 4 and looking at the Fourier spectra in Fig. 7, let us recall that,
according to the theory of Sec. 3 and Fig. 2, the relevant Floquet exponent is pure imaginary at
∆ = ∆c. So changing ∆ from above ∆c, where the invariant 2D torus is stable, downward (r is
ﬁxed) we encounter another bifurcation point at ∆ = ∆c, and the torus is expected to bifurcate
into a 3D torus, embedded in the 5D phase space of the complex Lorenz model. Computer
simulation conﬁrms this conclusion. Comprehensive analysis of this secondary bifurcation is
beyond the scope of this paper (some results on the subject were obtained in [22]). Further
decrease of ∆ would result in other bifurcations. Taking into account that the spectra of Fig. 7
are typical of period doublings, it can be suggested that the chaotic attractor forms at relatively
small ∆ after a cascade of doublings. The irregular Fourier spectrum at ∆ = 0.05, displayed
in Fig. 8, clearly indicates chaotic dynamics of the system.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have studied some detuning induced eﬀects in dynamical model of the single-
mode laser. The key point of stability analysis and bifurcation theory, presented in Sec. 2-3,
is that dynamical symmetry breaking must be taken into consideration. It is shown that the
symmetry breaking results in formation of an invariant set of equilibria, which is an orbit of
the stationary point given by Eq.(7), at r = r0 and leads to the appearance of low frequency
Goldstone-type mode related to the motion along the orbit at r = rc. Moreover, it is found
that there is the symmetry induced term in Eq. (35), so that stability of the branching doubly-
periodic solution (invariant torus) is aﬀected by the symmetry breaking.

Coming back to dymanics of the laser system (Eq.(1)), let us discuss what are the eﬀects
that could be observed experimentally. It should be noticed that, typically, it is diﬃcult to
meet the condition r > rc in a single-mode laser and it was just a few experiments with gas
lasers, where the threshold of dynamical instability was exceeded [23, 24]. Based on the results
of the above theory (Sec. 2-3) and numerical analysis (Sec. 4), in experimental setup of [24]
with homogeneously broadened one-mode CO2 laser one could expect three diﬀerent types of
the system behaviour as pumping increases:

• At suﬃciently small detuning, ∆ < ∆0, (∆0 ≈ 0.07 at σ = 5 and b = 1) the chaotic

attractor forms abruptly during the passage of r through rc;

• The system undergoes a cascade of doublings before its transition to chaos at ∆0 < ∆ <

∆c;

• If ∆ > ∆c, the system does not reveal chaotic behaviour even if r ≈ 10 − 20 rc.

This gives an insight into why just an oscillatory instability was observed for single-mode
operation of the laser in [23, 24]. The eﬀect can be attributed to the oﬀ-center pumping that
was used to ensure the single-mode operation, so that the detuning ∆ was greater than its
critical value ∆c.

From the other hand, recently the real Lorenz equations has been employed to study
three parameter kinetics of a phase transition [25]. The model was found to represent the main
features of a second order phase transition in the case of real order parameter. It seems to be
straightforward to extend the arguments given in [25] to the case of complex order parameter, so
that the complex Lorenz model could play an important part in investigation of the kinetics of
a nonequilibrium second order phase transition. Notice that, according to synergetic approach
[13], a phase transition is realized as a result of mutual coordination between the complex order
parameter (X), the conjugate ﬁeld (Y ) and the control parameter (Z). So our results can be
regarded as an extension of the analogy between nonequilibrium phase transitions and phase
transitions in thermodynamic systems.

In conclusion, we give some details on a quantum counterpart of the complex Lorenz
model. As it was mentioned in Sec. 1, in the semiclassical approximation, the well-known
N-center Dicke hamiltonian [26]:

can provide the Lorenz equations. Recall that equations of motion must be supplemented
with the relaxation terms as well as the term descriptive of pumping. As far as the problem of
quantum chaos is concerned, Eq.(38) cannot be considered as an explicit quantum counterpart
of Eq.(2). Clearly, the reason is that relaxation and pumping do not enter Eq.(38).

One way to get rid of the above shortcoming is to use two oscillator representation for
the Pauli operators that enter Eq.(38) [26, 27]: σ+ → a+
i (ai) is the
bosonic creation (anihilation) operator of the i-th oscillator. The resulting hamiltonian reads:

2 a1, σ− → a+

1 a2, where a+

H = ω · b+b + ω1 · a+

1 a1 + ω2 · a+

2 a2 + g · (b+ a+

1 a2 + b a+

2 a1)

The next step is to write master equation for density matrix ρ in the form [30]:

− ˙ρ = i[H, ρ] + γ0 · Lb ρ + γ1 · L1 ρ + γ2 · L2 ρ

where

Lb ρ = {[b+, bρ] − [b, ρ b+]} + exp (−βω) · {[b, b+ρ] − [b+, ρ b]},

Li ρ = {[a+

i ]} + exp (−βiωi) · {[ai, a+

i ρ] − [a+
i , aiρ] − [ai, ρ a+
β = 1/(kBT0), βi = 1/(kBTi); kB is the Boltzman constant.
It is supposed that the i-th
oscillator interacts with its thermostat characterized by a temperature of Ti and the thermostats
are statistically independent(more details on systems of such kind can be found in [28, 29]).
Note that the exact solution of the three oscillator model (Eq. (39)) was recently derived by
making use of the algebraic Bethe ansatz [31].

i , ρ ai]},

Assuming that hba+

i aji ≈ hbi · ha+

i aji and Γ1 = Γ2 (Γi = γi · (1 − exp (−βiωi))), Eq.(1)

can be readily derived from Eq. (40). So we have:

{b, α, S} ↔ {hbi, ha+

2 a1i, ha+

2 a2 − a+

1 a1i},

ωa = ω2 − ω1, κ = γ0 · (1 − exp (−βω)), γ = 1/T = 2 Γ1,

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)
where hnii = (exp (βiωi) − 1)−1. Note that for d0 to be positive it is necessary to meet

d0/2 = hni2 − hni1,

the condition: T2/T1 > ω2/ω1.

Thus, phenomenological parameters are expressed in terms of microscopic quantities by
Eqs.(41-43) and Eqs.(39-40) yield the explicit quantum counterpart of the complex Lorenz
model that can be employed to study the problem of quantum chaos [32]. This work is under
progress.

Fig. 1 The ratio of the dynamical instability threshold rc to the laser generation threshold
r0 = 1 + ∆2 as a function of detuning ∆ at b = 1 for σ = 3 (solid line) and σ = 5 (dashed
line). It is seen that rc is an increasing function of ∆.

Fig. 2 Dependence of ℜ(k) (see Eq.(35)) on ∆ at b = 1 for σ = 5 (solid line) and σ = 10
(dashed line). In both of the cases the coeﬃcient is shown to change its sign at critical
value of the detuning.

Fig. 3 Trajectory in 3D ℜ(X) − ℜ(Y ) − Z subspace at σ = 5, b = 1 and r = rc + 0.2 for
∆ = 0.5, rc ≈ 23.41. The trajectory is shown to wind up the stable invariant torus.

Fig. 4 Trajectory in 3D ℜ(X) − ℜ(Y ) − Z subspace at σ = 5, b = 1 and r = rc + 0.2 for

∆ = 0.1, rc ≈ 15.28.

Fig. 5 The strange Lorenz attractor in 3D ℜ(X) − ℜ(Y ) − Z subspace at σ = 5, b = 1 and
r = rc + 0.2 for ∆ = 0, rc ≈ 15. The plots in Figs. 3-5 indicate transition of the attractor
from the invariant torus (Fig. 3) to the Lorenz strange attractor (Fig. 5) as ∆ decreases.

Fig. 6 Fourier spectra |X(ω)| and |Z(ω)| at σ = 5, b = 1 and r = rc + 0.2 for ∆ = 0.5. There
are three peaks in the spectrum |X(ω)|: ω = 0, ω ≈ 0.04 (see the inset in the upper right
corner), ω ≈ α = 5.5. There is no low frequency splitting mode in the spectrum |Z(ω)|,
so that the second peak is associated with the Goldstone-type mode (see Sec. 3).

Fig. 7 Fourier spectra |X(ω)| and |Z(ω)| at σ = 5, b = 1 and r = rc + 0.2 for ∆ = 0.1. Both

spectra are typical of doublings.

The strong asymmetry in charge distribution supporting a single non-interacting spatial needle
soliton in a paraelectric photorefractive is directly observed by means of electroholographic readout.
Whereas in trapping conditions a quasi-circular wave is supported, the underlying double-dipolar
structure can be made to support two distinct propagation modes.

Far from being a peculiarity of low dimensional sys-
tems, solitary waves and solitons have been widely doc-
umented in bulk three-dimensional environments [1]. In
biased photorefractives, nonlinear visible optical waves
have been shown to undergo self-trapping both as ex-
in the form of slab-
tended one-dimensional waves,
solitons [2], and as conﬁned two-dimensional spatial
beams, needle-solitons [3].
These are self-funneled
micron-sized beams of light that propagate through the
bulk dielectric without suﬀering diﬀraction or distortion.
Needles, in their richer higher-dimensional environment,
have led to a substantial advance in our phenomenolog-
ical investigation of nonlinear dynamics, expanding the
scope of possible soliton-based applications [4] [5].

Whereas both slabs and needles emerge in the same
physical system, a biased photorefractive sample, their
underlying nonlinear nature is rather diﬀerent [6]. For
slabs, the entire physical system, and thus, consequently,
the optical nonlinearity, depends only on the transverse
beam direction along which the external ﬁeld is applied
(say the x direction), whereas the system is fully invariant
for spatial translations in the second orthogonal trans-
verse direction y. This reduces slab soliton description to
that associated with a saturated Kerr-like nonlinearity
[7]. For needles, on the contrary, the higher dimension-
ality of the optical beam, whose quasi circular symmetry
suggests an isotropic self-action [3], is inherently at odds
with the screening nonlinearity, whose one basic driv-
ing mechanism is the x directed external bias ﬁeld. A
simpliﬁed description of needles, tracing the steps that
lead to a local Kerr-like understanding of slabs, is simply
not possible [8]. Given the complexity of the higher-
dimensional interaction, the theoretical interpretation of
needles is largely based on numerical integration. What
emerges is a picture in which nonlocal nonlinear eﬀects
[9], as opposed to local conventional paradigm Kerr-like
phenomenology, play a central role. An understanding of

these requires an explicit distinction between the under-
lying space-charge ﬁeld distribution Esc, which mediates
self-action, and the propagating light ﬁeld Eopt. The
space-charge distribution simply does not have a local
relationship to the optical ﬁeld [8]. The numerical so-
lution of the full boundary-value problem indicates that
the highly anisotropic screening conﬁguration allows the
formation of needles only through an equally anisotropic
local space-charge, characterized by the appearance of
two distinct lateral ﬁeld lobes in the x direction, absent
in the second transverse direction y [6] [9]. This dou-
ble dipolar ﬁeld distribution induces, as a consequence,
a complicated needle supporting index pattern that has
little to do with a mere self-written graded-index waveg-
uide (excluding the possibility of a simple linear interpre-
tation [10]). For system parameters far from the soliton
supporting conﬁguration, this anisotropy leads to an ob-
servable asymmetric beam distortion, but the question
naturally arises as to how these lobes manifest their ex-
istence when the optical beam is actually a needle-like
solitary wave.

Repulsion of mutually incoherent needles provides in-
direct evidence of the lobe-like charge distribution [11].
However, no direct experimental evidence of charge
anisotropy has yet been reported. The main reason lies
in the fact that photorefractive solitons are generally ob-
served in ferroelectric samples.
In these crystals there
is no direct way of isolating the contribution of charge
displacement from the ﬁnal guiding structure. Read-
out with non-photorefractively active light can lead to
no substantial increase in knowledge on the underlying
charge pattern, short of performing precise bulk inter-
ferograms or far ﬁeld soliton transforms [9]. Direct in-
vestigation of the space-charge residue with a probe is
furthermore hampered by the fact that the lobes are ac-
tually antiguiding [6] [9].

In this Letter we give direct evidence of this nonlocal

ﬁeld structure. This is made possible by the quadratic
electro-optic response of paraelectrics, that allows the
electro-holographic separation of optical phenomenology
from the underlying space-charge ﬁeld [5].

Experiments are carried out in a sample of photore-
fractive 3.7xx4.7yx2.4z mm KLTN (potassium-lithium-
tantalate-niobate) [12] , biased along the x axis (of size
L=3.7mm), and kept at a constant temperature T=20◦C.
The x-polarized cw TEM00 λ=532nm beam from a diode-
pumped doubled NdYag laser is focused on the input
facet of the sample and launched along the z axis. As
it propagates in the sample, it diﬀracts, passing from
intensity I=|Eopt|2 full-width-half-maximum
an initial
(FWHM) in the x and y directions ∆x ∼= ∆y ∼= 10µm to
a broadened intensity distribution of ∆x ∼= ∆y ∼= 20µm
(see Fig1.(a),(b)). The application of the external con-
stant bias V on the x electrodes makes photoexcited free
charges drift, leading to an inhomogeneous ﬁeld screen-
ing. The electro-optic response of the paraelectric sam-
0(ǫr − 1)2(V /L)2(E/(V /L))2 ≡
ple is ∆n = −(1/2)n3g11ǫ2
−∆n0E 2, where n ∼= 2.4 is the zero-ﬁeld index of refrac-
tion, g11 ≡ gxxxx ∼= 0.12m4C−2 is the dominant com-
ponent of the quadratic electro-optic tensor gijkl (and
thus tensorial eﬀects are neglected), ǫ0 is the vacuum
dielectric constant, ǫr ∼= 9· 103 (at T∼=20◦C) is the rela-
tive sample low frequency dielectric constant, E is the x
component of the electric ﬁeld resulting from screening,
∆n0 ∼= 2.8 · 10−4, and E ≡ E/(V /L). The spatially mod-
ulated index distribution allows needle formation (see
Fig.1(c)). The needle, that shows a slight anisotropy in
the output intensity distribution, is trapped and stable
in time for an external bias voltage of V=0.85kV and a
ratio of peak intensity Ip to the dark artiﬁcial illumina-
tion Ib (obtained by illuminating the sample with a co-
propagating y polarized plane wave of equal wavelength)
of u2
0 ≡ Ip/Ib ∼=2.6. Annulling the externally applied
voltage V, i.e., setting V=0, gives an index modulation
∆nV =0 = −∆n0E 2
sc, only due to the charge displace-
ment, where evidently E sc ≡ E-1. The resulting index
pattern has a guiding structure for regions in which E sc
passes through a minimum. Given that the lobes repre-
sent an excess of screening in the x direction [6] [9], there
are two points, i.e., x1 and x2, along the x axis, located
to the left and right of the needle peak, in which ∆nV =0
forms a guiding ”hump”. Along the y axis, this hump
will follow the shape of the lobe.

In order to investigate ∆nV =0 without modifying the
space-charge distribution, we launch into the sample the
same beam leading to the needle, but attenuated so as
to have a much lower intensity. This guarantees that the
characteristic time scale of charge displacement induced
by the probe, τd, is much longer than any characteristic
observation time. For typical µW intensity beams, τd ∼1
min.

tion pattern in the x direction. The slight asymmetry
in the diﬀraction pattern is a consequence of needle self-
bending, that inevitably distorts the diﬀractive read-out
phase.

A similar phenomenology has been observed for tran-
sient quasi-steady-state needles, where Ib=0, blocking
beam evolution in the trapped regime, i.e., before the
needle has decayed.

The two light lobes are a signature of the lobes pre-
dicted by numerical integration of the full Kukhtarev
model and constitute direct proof that the nonlinear-
ity supporting needle trapping in biased photorefrac-
tives is not the saturated Kerr-like ∆n ∝ 1/(1 + I/Ib)2
that allows slab formation. More precisely, whereas
the lobes are not present in the slab case (and are not
merely ”negligible”), they play a fundamental role in
needle trapping [13]. Although needles have been doc-
umented in various conditions, it is legitimate to ask
whether the nonlocal space-charge ﬁeld structure, and
thus index modulation, can actually support circular-
symmetric solitary waves. The mathematical answer is
no [14]. However, the anisotropic space-charge struc-
ture can support waves that are to all practical purposes
circular-symmetric. For the conditions investigated ex-

perimentally, we ﬁnd the space-charge distribution by
solving the simpliﬁed associated electro-static problem,
i.e., ∇ · [(I + Ib)E + (KbT /q)∇I]=0, where E [8] is the in-
ternal electric ﬁeld vector, assuming a given Gaussian in-
tensity distribution. The resulting index pattern is shown
in Fig.(2a). Propagating the very same ﬁeld distribu-
tion Eopt (whose intensity is I, shown in Fig.(2b)) into
this pattern, gives results shown in Fig.(2c)-(2d). The
intensity pattern does not suﬀer discernible distortion.
This means that the exact nonlinear behaviour is well
described by this approximate linear approach, and thus
we can conclude that quasi-circular needles can be sup-
ported by the anisotropic pattern.

FIG. 2. Self-consistency of a needle solitons trapped in the
anisotropic nonlinear index pattern.
(a) Anisotropic index
pattern; (b) input intensity distribution; (c)-(d) Intensity af-
ter 2mm and 4.5mm propagation, respectively, for the exper-
imental situation described above.

One basic consequence of these ﬁndings is that the
anisotropy underlying a photorefractive needle leads not
to one, but to three spatially separated index structures,
that can be made to alternatively guide light depending
on the applied external voltage in the read-out phase.
This would not have been possible had the nonlinear re-
sponse been local, as in the one-dimensional case [5]. The
electroholographic read-out would have implied a tran-
sition from a localized single mode structure (the nee-
dle) to a delocalized ”doughnut-like” guiding pattern. To
demonstrate this, we investigate the guiding capabilities
at V=0. We were able to show the two guided modes
launching, in sequence, the probe beam into one of the
two lateral guiding humps of the ∆nV =0 pattern, i.e., in
x1 and x2. Results are shown in Fig.3. We did not ob-
serve any directional coupling between the modes, this
clearly being a consequence both of the distance between
the humps, the probe wavelength, propagation length,
and the presence of the antiguiding central pattern.

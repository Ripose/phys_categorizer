Abstract

Extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) is a new type of Bragg scattering in
thick, slanted, periodic gratings. It is realised when the scattered wave propa-
gates parallel to the front boundary of the grating. Its most important feature
is the strong resonant increase in the scattered wave amplitude compared to the
amplitude of the incident wave: the smaller the grating amplitude, the larger the
amplitude of the scattered wave. In this paper, rigorous numerical analysis of
EAS is carried out by means of the enhanced T-matrix algorithm. This includes
investigation of harmonic generation inside and outside the grating, unusually
strong edge effects, fast oscillations of the incident wave amplitude in the grat-
ing, etc. Comparison with the previously developed approximate theory is car-
ried out. In particular, it is demonstrated that the applicability conditions for
the two-wave approximation in the case of EAS are noticeably more restrictive
than those for the conventional Bragg scattering. At the same time, it is shown
that the approximate theory is usually highly accurate in terms of description
of EAS in the most interesting cases of scattering with strong resonant increase
of the scattered wave amplitude. Physical explanation of the predicted effects is
presented.

Introduction

Scattering of bulk and guided electromagnetic waves in periodic gratings has been extensively in-
vestigated theoretically and numerically by many different authors using approximate and rigorous
methods of analysis [1–17]. The investigation has been carried out for thin and thick, uniform and
non-uniform, isotropic and anisotropic, reﬂecting and transmitting gratings that are represented by
strong or weak periodic modulation of structural parameters [1–17].
Very interesting physical effects and anomalies of scattering have been predicted and observed at
extreme angles of scattering, i.e., when the scattered wave propagates parallel to the grating. For
example, these are resonant coupling of bulk and surface [16,19], or bulk and guided waves [20],
non-linear stimulated scattering involving interaction of bulk and surface waves [21–23], Wood’s
anomalies [16,17], etc. However, all these effects and anomalies are relevant to scattering in thin
gratings, where the incident wave and/or scattered wave interact with the grating within a short
distance of the order of, or less than the wavelength [16–23]. For example, this happens in the case
of diffraction of a bulk electromagnetic wave on a periodic corrugation of an interface between two
media.
Bragg scattering in wide, oblique, periodic gratings with the scattered wave propagating parallel to
grating boundaries has been investigated less extensively compared to thin gratings. In the beginning
1

of 1970s a radically new type of Bragg scattering of X-rays in crystals and crystal plates (i.e. thick
gratings) was analysed theoretically [24–27]. It was called extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS).
However, the main efforts in theoretical and experimental investigation of EAS of X-ray and neutrons
were focused on the cases where an incident wave propagates almost parallel to the front boundary
of a crystal [28]. This allowed very precise structural analysis of interfaces and ultra-thin crystal
ﬁlms, and resulted in the development of efﬁcient collimators of X-rays and neutron beams [28].
At the same time, the geometry of EAS with grazing incident wave is not that interesting for the
development of applications in optical communication and instrumentation. Much more important
is the geometry where the incident wave propagates at a signiﬁcant angle with respect to boundaries
of a strip-like oblique periodic grating, and the scattered wave is parallel or almost parallel to these
boundaries. This is because of unique features displayed by EAS in this geometry [29–37]. However,
theoretical analysis of EAS of bulk and guided optical and surface acoustic waves has been carried
out only within the last few years [29–37].
The diffractional divergence of the scattered wave inside and outside the grating has been shown
to be the main physical reason for EAS [29–31,33,34]. A new powerful approach for the analytical
analysis of EAS, based on understanding the role of the diffractional divergence, has been developed
and justiﬁed [29–31,33,34]. The most important feature of this approach is that it is immediately
applicable for the description of EAS of all types of waves (including bulk, guided and surface optical
and acoustic waves) in all types of periodic gratings with small amplitude [29–37].
It has been shown that EAS is characterised by a resonantly large scattered wave amplitude (the
most interesting case of scattering) only if the grating amplitude is very small [29–34]. In this case,
the applicability conditions for the new approach are usually well satisﬁed [37], and the analytical
theory is expected to be accurate in predicting amplitudes of the incident and especially scattered
waves.
Since the main direction in the development of the modern theory of gratings is related to improve-
ment of stability and convergence speed of numerical algorithms (see for example Ref.
[9]), the
development of the new numerically efﬁcient (analytical) method for the accurate description of
strong EAS (of all types of waves, including guided and surface modes) is an important step in the
grating theory. Moreover, this method has provided a unique insight into the physical reasons for
EAS [29–37]. This insight will allow thoughtful selection of optimal structural parameters for future
EAS-based devices and techniques.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that the new analytical approach is expected to describe accurately
EAS with strong resonant increase of the scattered wave amplitude, it is still unknown what happens
to EAS beyond the frames of the applicability of the analytical approach. That is, what changes in
the pattern of scattering should be introduced if the grating amplitude is strongly increased and/or
grating width is signiﬁcantly reduced? What are the exact errors of using the analytical approach
for various grating amplitudes and widths? How accurate are the applicability conditions for the
approximate theory? What are the most crucial parameters affecting the applicability of the analytical
approach? Which of the two waves—incident or scattered—is better described by the approximate
theory? All these questions remained largely unanswered in the previous publications.
Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to implement detailed rigorous analysis of EAS of bulk TE
electromagnetic waves in narrow and wide periodic gratings of arbitrary amplitude, represented by
sinusoidal variations of the dielectric permittivity. In addition, the analytical applicability conditions
for the approximate theory of EAS will be veriﬁed and compared with the results of the rigorous
theory. Physical mechanisms that are responsible for breaching these conditions will be discussed.
Typical errors related to the approximations of the analytical approach will be determined.

2 Numerical analysis

Consider an isotropic medium with a slab-like holographic periodic grating that is characterised by
sinusoidal variations of the dielectric permittivity:

ǫs = ǫ+ (ǫ1 exp(iqxx + iqy y) + c.c.),
ǫs = ǫ,
if x < 0 or x > L.

if 0 < x < L,

(1)

where the coordinate system is shown in Fig. 1, ǫ is the mean dielectric permittivity that is the same
inside and outside the grating, ǫ1 is the complex amplitude, q = (qx, qy) is the reciprocal lattice
vector, q = 2π/Λ, Λ is the period, and L is the width of the grating that is assumed to be inﬁnite
along the y- and z-axes. We also assume that the dissipation is absent, i.e., ǫ is real and positive. A
TE electromagnetic wave with the amplitude E00 and wave vector k0 is incident onto the grating at
an angle θ0 in the xy plane—Fig. 1 (non-conical scattering).

Figure 1: The geometry of EAS in a slanted periodic grating of width L. The Bragg condition is
satisﬁed precisely for the +1 harmonic that propagates parallel to the grating boundaries x = 0 and
x = L. The angle of incidence θ0 is not close to π/2.

In this case the solutions inside and outside the grating can be written as [7,8]

amplitudes: (a,b) ǫ1 = 5 × 10−3, (c,d) ǫ1 = 0.2. The grating orientation and period Λ ≈ 0.584µm
are determined by the Bragg condition. (a) The rigorous (solid curve with small oscillations) and ap-
proximate (solid curve without oscillations) x-dependencies of the amplitude of the zeroth harmonic

plitudes of the +1 harmonics (the scattered waves) inside the grating. (c) The thick solid curve is the
approximate x-dependence of the amplitude of the incident wave inside the grating. The rigorous
x-dependencies of amplitudes of the 0th, +2, and −1 harmonics are presented by the higher thin
solid curve, dotted curve, and lower thin solid curve, respectively.

If khy ≤ k0, then k1hx ≤ 0 and k2hx ≥ 0 (propagating waves), while if khy > k0, then Im(k1hx) < 0 and
Im(k2hx) > 0 (evanescent waves).
The Bragg condition is assumed to be satisﬁed precisely for the +1 harmonic in Eq. (2), i.e. for the
ﬁrst diffraction order with h = 1. In addition, the +1 harmonic is assumed to propagate parallel to
the x-axis (the geometry of EAS).
The rigorous analysis of ﬁrst-order scattering in this geometry has been carried out by means of
the enhanced transmittance matrix algorithm [7]. Fig. 2 presents the approximate and rigorous x-
dependencies of normalised amplitudes of harmonics from Eq. (2) inside the grating for EAS of bulk
TE electromagnetic waves. The structural parameters are as follows: ǫ = 5, θ0 = π/4, L = 10µm,
vacuum wavelength λ = 1µm, and the grating amplitudes are ǫ1 = 5 × 10−3 (Fig. 2a and b) and
ǫ1 = 0.2 (Fig. 2c and d). The grating period is determined by the Bragg condition: Λ ≈ 0.584µm.
Similar dependencies in Fig. 3a and b are presented for the same structure but with the grating
amplitude ǫ1 = 0.2. Only harmonics whose amplitudes are larger than ≈ 0.01E00 are presented in
Figs. 2 and 3.
It can be seen that in gratings with small amplitudes, where the scattered wave amplitude is espe-
cially large (Fig. 2a and b), the eect of all harmonics in the expansion (2), other than the zeroth har-
monic (the incident wave) and the +1 harmonic (the scattered wave), is completely negligible. The

monics in Eq. (2) in the same structure as for Fig. 2, but with ǫ1 = 1. (a) The rigorous dependencies
of amplitudes of the 0th harmonic (thin solid curve), −1 harmonic (higher dotted curve), −2 har-
monic (dashed curve), and −3 harmonic (lower dotted curve).
(b) The rigorous dependencies of
amplitudes of the +1 harmonic (thin solid curve), +2 harmonic (dotted curve), and +3 harmonic
(dashed curve). The thick solid curves represent the approximate x-dependencies of the incident (a)
and scattered (b) wave amplitudes, obtained from the approximate theory [29–32].

rigorous x-dependencies of the incident and scattered wave amplitudes inside the grating hardly
dier from the corresponding approximate dependencies that have been determined by means of the
approximate theory [31] (Fig. 2a and b). Thus, for sufﬁciently small grating amplitudes the approxi-
mate theory [29–34] provides a very accurate description of EAS and there is no need for the rigorous
analysis. The only other harmonic (in addition to the zeroth and +1 harmonics) that may have rea-
sonably noticeable amplitude is the +2 harmonic. This is due to the direct coupling of the resonantly
strong scattered wave (the +1 harmonic) and the +2 harmonics [4].
However, if the grating amplitude is signiﬁcantly increased from 5 × 10−3 to 0.2 (Fig. 2c and d) and
then to 1 (Fig. 3a and b), then the approximate theory is not always sufﬁcient for the description
of EAS. This is especially the case for the amplitude of the incident wave, i.e. the zeroth harmonic
in Eq. (2). For example, if ǫ1 = 0.2 (Fig. 2c), then the rigorously calculated x-dependence of the
zeroth harmonic amplitude is noticeably lower (on average) than the corresponding approximate

dependence (Fig. 2c), and is characterised by a number of oscillations (see also Fig. 3a).
These oscillations are related to boundary scattering of the scattered wave at the grating interface
x = L. The wave resulting from boundary scattering of the scattered wave at the rear boundary
x = L propagates in the negative x-direction as if it is a mirror reﬂected incident wave from this
boundary. Thus, the y-component of its wave vector is equal to the y-component of the wave vector
of the incident wave. However, the wave due to boundary scattering is not presented explicitly in
Eq. (2). Therefore the zeroth harmonic in Eq. (2) includes both the incident wave and the wave
caused by boundary scattering at x = L. The interference of these waves results in a standing wave
pattern represented by the fast oscillations of the zeroth harmonic amplitude—Figs. 2c and 3a. It can
be seen that the period of this standing wave pattern must be equal to λ/(2ǫ1/2 cosθ0), which is in
the excellent agreement with the rigorous dependencies in Figs. 2c and 3a.
As mentioned above, the average (over the period λ/(2ǫ1/2 cosθ0)) rigorously calculated amplitude
of the zeroth harmonic tends to be smaller than the amplitude predicted by the approximate theory—
see Figs. 2c and 3a. The larger the grating amplitude, the smaller the average amplitude of the zeroth
harmonic inside the grating (Figs. 2c and 3a). This is related to signiﬁcant boundary scattering at
the front grating interface, which results in energy losses in the zeroth harmonic with subsequent
reduction of its amplitude in the grating.
The contribution of higher harmonics to scattering rapidly increases when the grating amplitude ǫ1
exceeds ≈ 10% of the mean permittivity ǫ (compare Figs. 2c and 3a,b). It is however important that
amplitude of the scattered wave is accurately described by the approximate theory (within an error
less than ≈ 1%) up to grating amplitudes such that ǫ1/ǫ ≈ 0.1. Only when ǫ1/ǫ = 0.2 can noticeable
deviations between the rigorous and approximate amplitudes of the +1 harmonic be observed (Fig.
3a and b).
Increasing grating amplitude should result not only in noticeable amplitudes of several harmonics
in Eq. (2) (see Figs. 2 and 3), but also in signiﬁcant energy ﬂows from the grating due to propagating
waves in Eqs. (3) and (4) (in the considered examples these will correspond to h = −1, .., −5). In
addition, the zeroth harmonic in the sum of Eq. (3), caused by boundary scattering at the grating
interfaces, also results in an energy ﬂow away from the grating in the region x < 0. The associated
energy losses can be evaluated in terms of diffraction efﬁciencies that are determined as ratios of the
x-component of the Poynting vector in a wave travelling away from the grating to the x-component
of the Poynting vector in the incident wave at x < 0. If the diffraction efﬁciencies are small compared
to one, the energy losses are negligible, and the approximate theory of EAS is valid.
The dependencies of the diffraction efﬁciencies in the structure with ǫ = 5, θ0 = π/4, L = 10µm,
and λ = 1µm on grating amplitude ǫ1 are presented in Fig. 4. The dashed curve represents the
diffraction efﬁciency of the transmitted wave, i.e. the zeroth harmonic in Eq. (4). The solid line gives
the diffraction efﬁciency of the wave resulting from boundary scattering (i.e. the zeroth reﬂected
wave for x < 0), and the dotted curve gives the overall diffraction efﬁciency from all other waves
propagating outside the grating. Note that the diffraction efﬁciency for the scattered wave, i.e. the
+1 harmonic, is zero because it propagates parallel to the grating boundaries in both the regions
x < 0 and x > L.
It can be seen that if the grating amplitude ǫ1 < 0.12 (i.e. ǫ1 < 0.025ǫ), then all the diffraction
efﬁciencies other than that of the transmitted wave are less than ≈ 0.01 and can be neglected. The
diffraction efﬁciency for the transmitted wave in this case is ≈ 1 (Fig. 4).
It is interesting that all the diffraction efﬁciencies experience signiﬁcant oscillations with increasing
grating amplitude e1 . This is due to the interference of waves at the grating boundaries. For ex-
ample, the waves caused by boundary scattering at the front and rear grating boundaries interfere
constructively or destructively in the region x < 0, resulting in the oscillations of the solid curve in
Fig. 4.
All these results demonstrate that in the most interesting case of EAS with strong resonant increase of
the scattered wave amplitude the approximate theory [29–34] gives very accurate results, especially
for the scattered wave amplitude. Only when the grating amplitude increases so that the resonant
scattered wave amplitude becomes of the order of E00, does the approximate theory fail to accurately

Figure 4: The dependencies of the diffraction efﬁciencies on grating amplitude ǫ1 for the transmitted
wave with the amplitude B0 (dashed curve), zeroth reﬂected wave with the amplitude A0 (solid
curve), and the combined efﬁciency for all other propagating waves outside the grating (dotted
curve). The other structural parameters are as for the previous ﬁgures: ǫ = 5, θ0 = π/4, L = 10µm,
λ = 1µm, and Λ ≈ 0.584µm.

predict, ﬁrst, the incident wave amplitude inside the grating, and only then (if the grating amplitude
is increased up to ≈ 0.2ǫ) the scattered wave amplitude. Note, however, that this is correct only for
gratings of widths that are not much less than the critical grating width Lc [34–37]

Lc ≈ (2c/ω)[2ǫ−1|A1/(E00ǫ1)|]1/2,

(7)

where A1 is the amplitude of the +1 harmonic at the front boundary in a wide grating (with L >L c—
see Refs. [34–36]).
If the grating width L is decreased below Lc, then the approximate theory predicts that the scattered
wave amplitude inside and outside the grating must increase proportionally to L−1 [29–32,37]. In
this case, even if the grating amplitude is small, the direct coupling of the scattered wave (the +1
harmonic) to the +2 harmonics must result in increasing amplitude of the +2 harmonic inside the
grating. In addition, the wave resulting from boundary scattering (i.e. the zeroth harmonic in the
sum in Eq. (3)) must also increase proportionally to the amplitude of the scattered wave, i.e. propor-
tionally to L−1. These effects suggest that decreasing grating width will eventually lead to the breach
of the applicability of the approximate theory [29–32,37].
Fig. 5 presents the results of the rigorous and approximate analyses of EAS in gratings of different
widths: (a) and (b) L = 10µm; (c) and (d) L = 2µm; (e) and (f) L = 0.4µm. The other parameters are:
ǫ = 5, ǫ1 = 5 × 10−2, θ0 = π/4, λ = 1µ.
We can see that for L = 10µ the pattern of scattering is very much the same as in Fig. 2a–d. The
incident wave amplitude inside the grating experiences oscillations similar to those in Fig. 2c, but
with smaller amplitude (due to smaller ǫ1). The amplitudes of the +2 and −1 harmonics are small
(Fig. 5a), and the approximate and rigorous curves for the scattered wave amplitude are practically
indistinguishable—Fig. 5b.
If the grating width is reduced to 2µm (Fig. 5c and d), then the number of oscillations of the rigorous
dependence of the incident wave amplitude inside the grating is signiﬁcantly reduced. This is be-

with the parameters: ǫ = 5, ǫ1 = 5 × 10−2, θ0 = π/4, λ = 1µ, Λ ≈ 0.584µm, and the grating widths:

of amplitudes of the 0th harmonics (higher thin solid curves), +2 harmonics (dotted curves), and −1
harmonics (lower thin solid curves). The thick solid curves are the approximate x-dependencies of

approximate (solid curves) x-dependencies of amplitudes of the +1 harmonics (scattered waves).

cause fewer nodes of the standing wave pattern can ﬁt across a narrower grating. The amplitude of
the +2 harmonic is increased ≈ 2 times compared to the amplitude of the same harmonic in Fig. 5a.
This is because the amplitude of the scattered wave in Fig. 5d is ≈ 2 times larger than in Fig. 5b. Note
that for L = 2µm, the rigorous dependence of the +1 harmonic amplitude is only ≈ 0.03% different
from the approximate curve (Fig. 5d). That is, the oscillations of the incident wave amplitude and
noticeable amplitude of the 2 harmonic (Fig. 5c) hardly affect the scattered wave amplitude.
If the grating width is decreased further down to 0.4µm, then the rigorously calculated dependence
of the incident wave amplitude in the grating becomes drastically different from the approximate
dependence (Fig. 5e). The amplitude of the +2 harmonic becomes large and comparable with the
amplitude of the incident wave (Fig. 5e). Note however, that since the −1 harmonic is not coupled
directly to the resonantly large amplitude of the +1 harmonic, the amplitude of the −1 harmonic is
hardly affected by reducing grating width (compare the lower thin solid curves in Fig. 5a, c, and e).

For the grating width of 0.4µm the +1 harmonic amplitude is so large (Fig. 5f), that boundary scatter-
ing results in a signiﬁcant energy ﬂow from the grating. This is the main reason why the rigorously
calculated amplitudes of the +1 harmonic (scattered wave) appear to be noticeably smaller than
those obtained in the approximate theory [31] (Fig. 5f). The difference between these curves is about
5%. Thus, edge effects in the form of boundary scattering are the main reason for the failure of the
approximate theory [29–32] to accurately predict scattered wave amplitudes in the case of EAS in
narrow gratings.
Note again that all harmonics in Eq. (2), other than the zeroth, +1, +2, and −1 harmonics, have
very small amplitudes in the considered structures for all grating widths (Fig. 5a–f), and thus can be
neglected.

Figure 6: The dependencies of the diffraction efﬁciencies on grating width L for the transmitted wave
with the amplitude B0 (dashed curve), zeroth reﬂected wave with the amplitude A0 (solid curve),
and the combined efﬁciency for all other propagating waves outside the grating (dotted curve)—can
hardly be seen near the origin of the graph. The structural parameters are the same as for Fig. 5:
ǫ = 5, ǫ1 = 5 × 10−2, θ0 = π/4, λ = 1µ, and Λ ≈ 0.584µm.

The diffraction efﬁciencies versus grating width for the structure considered for Fig. 5 are presented
in Fig. 6. The dashed curve gives the diffraction efﬁciency of the transmitted wave (the zeroth har-
monic at x > L), and the solid curve gives the diffraction efﬁciency for the wave due to boundary
scattering. The overall efﬁciency for other propagating waves is signiﬁcantly less than 1%, and the
relevant dotted curve can hardly be seen close to the origin of the graph (Fig. 6). This ﬁgure demon-
strates that, as mentioned above, decreasing grating width below 1µm results in signiﬁcant bound-
ary scattering. This results in the failure of the approximate theory. However, for grating widths
L > 1µm all diffraction efﬁciencies, except for that of the transmitted wave, are negligible (Fig. 6),
and the approximate theory gives very accurate results, at least in terms of predicting scattered wave
amplitudes inside and outside the grating.
Note that the analysis of the case with L > Lc has already been carried out in Figs. 2c,d, 3a,b, and
4. Therefore, increasing grating width beyond 10µm does not reveal any new features of EAS. In
addition, the typical number of oscillations of the rigorously calculated dependencies of the wave
amplitudes (see Figs. 2, 3, and 5) increases proportionally to L, which would make relevant ﬁgures
unreadable. Therefore, the numerical results have been presented only for gratings of L ≤ 10µm,
though the enhanced T-matrix approach is stable for gratings of arbitrary width [7,8].

3 Applicability conditions for the approximate theory

As was demonstrated in the previous section, the approximate theory of EAS, based on the two-
wave approximation and the scalar theory of diffraction of the scattered wave [29–32], normally
gives accurate results in the most interesting cases of scattering with strong resonant increase of
the scattered wave amplitude. It has also been shown [37], that the applicability conditions for the
approximate theory of EAS can be evaluated in two different ways. First, we take the applicability
condition for the two-wave approximation in the case of the conventional Bragg scattering of TE
electromagnetic waves [4]

ρ = λ2Λ−2|ǫ1|−1 = q2ǫ/(k2

0|ǫ1|) > 10

and divide ρ by the normalised maximal value of the scattered wave amplitude:

ρEAS = ρ|E00/max(|E1(x)|)| > 10

This inequality can be regarded as the applicability condition for the approximate theory of EAS
[37]. The factor |E00/max(|E1(x)|)| appears in inequality (9) because in the case of EAS the scattered
wave amplitude is much larger than the amplitude of the incident wave: |E1| ≪ |E00|. As indicated
in Section 2, this may result in unusually strong boundary scattering, oscillations of the incident wave
amplitude inside the grating, and large amplitude of the 2 harmonic (all these effects are proportional
to |E1|).
If inequality (12) is satisﬁed, then the errors in the energy ﬂux in the scattered wave, which result
from the use of the two-wave approximation, are expected to be of the order of ≈ 1/ρ2
EAS, i.e., less
than 1% (see also Ref. [4]).
Another way of evaluating applicability conditions for the approximate theory [29–32,37] is to di-
rectly evaluate boundary scattering [37]. Figs. 4 and 6 demonstrate that boundary scattering of a
resonantly large scattered wave amplitude is the main source of error in the case of small grating am-
plitudes. For large grating amplitudes, it gives approximately the same average diffraction efﬁciency
as all other harmonics with h 6= 0, 1 (Fig. 4). Therefore, conditions for neglecting boundary scatter-
ing can be regarded as the applicability conditions for the approximate theory of EAS [29–32,37]. The
evaluation of the efﬁciency of boundary scattering has demonstrated [37] that the energy ﬂow in the
zeroth reﬂected wave at x < 0 can be neglected if

(8)

(9)

4(∆x/L)2 ≪ 1 if L ≤ Lc,
4(∆x/Lc)2 ≪ 1 if L > Lc,

(10)

where Lc is the critical grating width determined by Eq. (7) [34–37], and ∆x is the typical thickness
of the region around the front grating boundary [37], where from the energy of the scattered wave is
transferred into the energy of the boundary scattered wave.
If conditions (10) are satisﬁed, then the diffraction efﬁciency for the boundary scattered wave in
the region x < 0 should be of the order of the left-hand sides of inequalities (10) [37]. Knowing
these efﬁciencies, we can easily evaluate typical variations of the scattered wave amplitude inside
the grating.
If L < Lc, then in accordance with condition (10), the diffraction efﬁciency for the transmitted wave
with the amplitude B0 (see Eq. (4)) can be evaluated as

where r = 4(∆x/L)2. From this equation we have:

|B0|2/|E00|2 ≈ 1 − r,

|B0| ≈ |E00|(1 − r/2).

(11)

If L < Lc , then the approximate theory [29–32] gives that the amplitude of the incident wave inside
the grating reduces linearly from the magnitude |E00| to approximately zero in the middle of the
grating, and then increases linearly back to |E00|—see Figs. 2a, 5c and e. This is due to re-scattering

of the scattered wave inside the grating [36,37]. The amplitude of the re-scattered wave increases
linearly with increasing x in the grating and has a phase shift ≈ π with respect to the incident wave.
In the middle of the grating, the magnitude of the re-scattered wave amplitude becomes equal to
|E00|, and at the rear grating boundary x = L it reaches approximately 2|E00|. If there is noticeable
boundary scattering, then the amplitude of the re-scattered wave at the rear boundary is less than
2|E00| by the value ∆E0 ≈ r|E00|/2 (see Eq.
(11)). On the other hand, the rate of increasing re-
scattered wave amplitude along the x-axis is directly proportional to the scattered wave amplitude.
Thus we can write:

2|E00| − r|E00|/2 ≈ G|E1|L,

where G is the coefﬁcient of proportionality between |E1| and the rate of increasing re-scattered wave
amplitude in the grating. The amplitude of the scattered wave inside the grating is reduced due to
energy losses caused by boundary scattering. Thus, |E1| = |E10| − ∆E1, where E10 is the scattered
wave amplitude determined by means of the approximate theory [29–32], and ∆E1 is the error in the
magnitude of this amplitude. Substituting this equation for |E1| in Eq. (12), and taking into account
that A|E10|L ≈ 2|E00|, we obtain:

Using Eq. (12) again, we get:

∆E1 ≈ r|E00|/(2AL) ≈ 2∆x2|E00|/(AL3).

∆E1/|E1| ≈ (∆x/L)2,
∆E1/|E1| ≈ (∆x/Lc)2,

if L ≤ Lc,
if L > Lc,

(14)

It is obvious that ∆x should be of the order of, or less than one wavelength in the medium. More
accurate evaluation of the thickness ∆x can be obtained from the comparison of conditions (14) with
the rigorous numerical results.
Fig. 7 presents the contour plot for the 1% error in the approximate scattered wave amplitude [31] as a
function of grating width L and grating amplitude ǫ1 for EAS of bulk TE electromagnetic waves. The
structural parameters are as previously: ǫ = 5, θ0 = π/4, λ = 1µ, and Λ ≈ 0.584µm. In the shaded
regions the maximal difference (error) between the rigorous and approximate x-dependencies of the
scattered wave amplitude is more than 1%, while in the unshaded regions this error is less than 1%.
If we assume that in Eqs. (14) ∆x = λm/e, where λm = λ/ǫ1/2, then the contour of the 1% error,
obtained from Eqs. (14), is represented by the dashed rectangle in Fig. 7. Inside this rectangle Eqs.
(14) predict the error in the approximate scattered wave amplitudes being less than 1%. Outside this
rectangle, this error should be larger than 1%. We can see that there is a good general agreement
between the errors predicted by the approximate applicability conditions (14) (with ∆x = λm/e) and
the rigorously calculated 1% error contour (Fig. 7).
Very similar results can be obtained using condition (9) that gives relative errors of the scattered
wave amplitude of ≈ 1/(2ρ2
EAS). The resultant 1% error contour for the scattered wave amplitude is
determined by the equation:

21/2ρEAS = 10,

(15)

and is presented in Fig. 7 by the thick solid curve. Below this curve, the errors related to the ap-
proximate theory are predicted to be less than 1%. This curve is again in a good agreement with the
rigorously calculated errors (Fig. 7). Note however, that Eqs. (14) seem to provide slightly more ac-
curate prediction for the applicability of the approximate theory in the case of narrow gratings—Fig.
7. Otherwise, conditions (9), and (10) (i.e., Eqs. (14) and (15)) are basically equivalent.
Note again that the most interesting range of grating amplitudes ǫ1 is where the scattered wave
amplitude is increased many times compared to the amplitude of the incident wave. Usually, this
happens for values of ǫ1 below ≈ 10−2ǫ (see Figs. 2 and 5). Fig. 7 demonstrates that in this region,
the approximate theory [29–32] is very accurate in terms of predicting amplitudes of the scattered
wave, except for very narrow gratings with L ≤ 2.5λm.

Figure 7: The rigorously calculated contours of 1% difference between the approximate and rigorous
scattered wave amplitudes. In the shaded regions, the maximal error in the approximate scattered
wave amplitude are larger than 1%, whereas in the unshaded regions this error are less than 1%.
The dashed rectangle is the approximate contour of 1% error in the scattered wave amplitude, de-
termined by Eqs. (14) with ∆x ≈ λm/e. Inside this rectangle, the error in the approximate scattered
wave amplitude is expected to be smaller than 1%. The thick solid curve represents the approximate
contour of 1% error in the scattered wave amplitude, determined from Eq. (15).

4 Conclusions

Thus, EAS of bulk TE electromagnetic waves in a uniform, strip like, slanted, periodic grating with
a mean dielectric permittivity that is the same inside and outside the grating, has been rigorously
analysed in this paper. Scattering in gratings with various grating amplitudes and grating widths
has been investigated. In particular, it has been shown that the approximate theory, based on the
two-wave approximation and the analysis of the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave [29–
34,37], usually gives very accurate results in gratings with small grating amplitude, especially in
terms of predicting amplitudes of the scattered wave.
At the same time, it has been demonstrated that resonantly large scattered wave amplitudes in the
geometry of EAS may result in signiﬁcant effects that cannot be explained within the approximate
theory. These are unusually strong boundary scattering, large amplitude of the +2 harmonic, and
noticeable oscillations of the incident wave amplitude in the grating. These effects become noticeable
only if the grating width is sufﬁciently small (much less than the critical width [34–36]), or if the
grating amplitude exceeds ≈ 10−2 of the mean dielectric permittivity in the structure. It has also been
demonstrated that the main source for errors of the approximate theory of EAS in narrow gratings
with small amplitude is boundary scattering (edge effects) at the grating interfaces.
The applicability conditions for the approximate theory [29–34] have been discussed, veriﬁed, and
adjusted by comparing the approximate applicability conditions derived in paper [37] with the re-
sults of the rigorous analysis of EAS.

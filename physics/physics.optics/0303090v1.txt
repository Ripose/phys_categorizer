Statistical Properties of Nonlinear Phase Noise

Keang-Po Ho
StrataLight Communications, Campbell, CA 95008∗
(Dated: September 2, 2013)

The statistical properties of nonlinear phase noise, often called the Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect, is
studied analytically when the number of ﬁber spans is very large. The joint characteristic functions
of the nonlinear phase noise with electric ﬁeld, received intensity, and the phase of ampliﬁer noise are
all derived analytically. Based on the joint characteristic function of nonlinear phase noise with the
phase of ampliﬁer noise, the error probability of signal having nonlinear phase noise is calculated
using the Fourier series expansion of the probability density function. The error probability is
increased due to the dependence between nonlinear phase noise and the phase of ampliﬁer noise.
When the received intensity is used to compensate the nonlinear phase noise, the optimal linear and
nonlinear compensators are derived analytically using the joint characteristic function of nonlinear
phase noise and received intensity. The nonlinear compensator based on the conditional mean
performs slightly better than the linear compensator.

INTRODUCTION

When optical ampliﬁers are used to compensate for
ﬁber loss, the interaction of ampliﬁer noise and the ﬁber
Kerr eﬀect causes phase noise, often called the Gordon-
Mollenauer eﬀect or nonlinear phase noise [1]. Nonlinear
phase noise degrades phase-modulated signal like phase-
shifted keying (PSK) and diﬀerential phase-shift keying
(DPSK) signal [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. This class of
constant-intensity modulation has renewed attention re-
cently for long haul and/or spectral eﬃciency transmis-
sion systems [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

Traditionally, the performance of the system is evalu-
ated based on the variance of the nonlinear phase noise
[1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Recently, it is found that the nonlin-
ear phase noise is not Gaussian-distributed both experi-
mentally [8] and analytically [16, 17]. For non-Gaussian
noise, neither the variance nor the Q-factor is suﬃcient
to characterize the performance of the system. The prob-
ability density function (p.d.f.) is required to better un-
derstand the noise properties and evaluates the system
performance.

The p.d.f. of nonlinear phase noise alone [16, 17] is
not suﬃcient to characterize the signal with nonlinear
phase noise. Because of the dependence between nonlin-
ear phase noise and signal phase, the joint p.d.f. of the
nonlinear phase noise and the signal phase is required
to evaluate the error probability for a phase-modulated
system. This article provides analytical expressions of
the joint asymptotic characteristic functions for the non-
linear phase noise and the received electric ﬁeld without
nonlinear phase noise. The ampliﬁer noise is asymptot-
ically modeled as a distributed process for a large num-
ber of ﬁber spans. After the characteristic function is

∗Electronic address: kpho@stratalight.com

ﬁrst derived analytically, the p.d.f. is the inverse Fourier
transform of the corresponding characteristic function.

The received phase is the summation of the nonlinear
phase noise and the phase of ampliﬁer noise. Using the
joint characteristic function of nonlinear phase noise and
the phase of ampliﬁer noise, the p.d.f. of the received
phase can be expanded as a Fourier series. Using the
Fourier series, the error probability of DPSK signal is
evaluated by a series summation. Because the nonlinear
phase noise has a weak dependence on the phase of am-
pliﬁer noise, the Fourier series expansion is more compli-
cated than traditional method in which the extra phase
noise is independent of the signal phase [18, 19].

Correlated with each other, the received intensity can
be used to compensate the nonlinear phase noise. When
a linear compensator compensates the nonlinear phase
noise using a scaled version of the received intensity
[5, 6, 7, 20], the optimal linear compensator is found
using the joint characteristic function of nonlinear phase
noise and received intensity. The minimum mean-square
compensator is the conditional mean of the nonlinear
10.2]. Us-
phase noise given the received intensity [21,
ing the conditional characteristic function of the nonlin-
ear phase noise given the received intensity, the optimal
nonlinear compensator is found to perform slightly better
than the linear compensator.

§

Sec. II builds the mathematical model of the nonlinear
phase noise and derives the joint characteristic function
of the normalized nonlinear phase noise and electric ﬁeld.
Sec. III gives the marginal p.d.f of nonlinear phase noise
by inverse Fourier transform. Sec. IV obtains the joint
characteristic functions of the nonlinear phase noise with
received intensity and the phase of ampliﬁer noise. Us-
ing the joint characteristic function of nonlinear phase
noise with the phase of ampliﬁer noise, Sec. V calculates
the exact error probability of DPSK signal with nonlinear
phase noise. An approximation is also presented based on
the assumption that the nonlinear phase noise is indepen-

dent of the phase of ampliﬁer noise. Using the joint char-
acteristic function of nonlinear phase noise with received
intensity, Sec. VI provides the optimal linear and non-
linear compensators to compensate the nonlinear phase
noise using received intensity. Finally, Sec. VII is the
conclusion of this article.

II. JOINT STATISTICS OF NONLINEAR
PHASE NOISE AND ELECTRIC FIELD

This section provides the joint characteristic function
of nonlinear phase noise and the electric ﬁeld without
nonlinear phase noise. Both the nonlinear phase noise
and the electric ﬁeld are ﬁrst normalized and represented
as the summation of inﬁnite number of independently dis-
tributed random variables. The joint characteristic func-
tion of nonlinear phase noise and electric ﬁeld is the prod-
uct of the corresponding joint characteristic functions of
those random variables. After some algebraic simpliﬁca-
tions, the joint characteristic function has a simple ex-
pression.

A. Normalization of Nonlinear Phase Noise

In a lightwave system, nonlinear phase noise is induced
by the interaction of ﬁber Kerr eﬀect and optical ampli-
ﬁer noise. In this article, nonlinear phase noise is induced
by self-phase modulation through the ampliﬁer noise in
the same polarization as the signal and within an opti-
cal bandwidth matched to the signal. The phase noise
induced by cross-phase modulation from ampliﬁer noise
outside that optical bandwidth is ignored for simplicity.
The ampliﬁer noise from the orthogonal polarization is
also ignored for simplicity. As shown later, we can include
the phase noise from cross-phase modulation or orthog-
onal polarization by simple modiﬁcation.

For an N -span ﬁber system, the overall nonlinear phase

noise is [1] [7] [16]

cient and the eﬀective ﬁber length per span. In (1), both
electric ﬁeld of ~E0 and ampliﬁer noises of ~nk can also be
represented as a complex number.

mean nonlinear phase shift of <ΦNL>= 1 rad corresponds
to the limitation estimated by [1]. The mean nonlinear
phase shift of <ΦNL>= 2 rad corresponds to the limita-
tion given by [7] when the standard deviation of nonlinear
phase noise is halved using a linear compensator.

The number of spans is N = 32. The transmitted signal

tion of Figs. 1 has 5000 points for diﬀerent noise combi-
nations. In practice, the signal distribution of Figs. 1 can
be measured using an optical phase-locked loop (see Fig.
5 of [22]). Note that although the optical phase-locked
loop actually tracks out the mean nonlinear phase shift of
<ΦNL>, nonzero values of <ΦNL> have been preserved
in plotting Figs. 1 to better illustrate the nonlinear phase
noise.

The approach here to derive the joint characteristic
function of normalized nonlinear phase noise and electric
ﬁeld is similar to that of [26] to ﬁnd the joint charac-
teristic function for polarization-mode dispersion [27] by
using an explicit solution. Another approach is to solve
the Fokker-Planck equation of the corresponding diﬀu-
sion process [23,

where m is product of the ratio of the ampliﬁer noise

polarization matched to signal bandwidth is considered,
m = 2 for two polarizations. The mean and variance of
the nonlinear phase noise increase slightly to ρs + m/2
and 2ρs/3+m/6, respectively. The nonlinear phase noise
is induced mainly by the beating of the signal and am-
pliﬁer noise from the same polarization, similar to the
case of signal-spontaneous beat noise in an ampliﬁed re-
ceiver. For high SNR of ρs, it is obvious that the signal-
ampliﬁer noise beating is the major contribution to non-
linear phase noise. The parameter of m can equal to 1/2
for the case if the ampliﬁer noise from another dimen-
sion is ignored by conﬁning to single-dimensional signal
and noise. In later part of this article, the characteristic
function of (17) can be changed to (21) if necessary.

Fig. 2 shows the p.d.f. using the exact characteristic func-

Φ = 2ρs/3 + 1/6.
From Fig. 2, the Gaussian distribution is not a good
model for nonlinear phase noise.

The p.d.f. for ﬁnite number of ﬁber spans was derived
base on the orthogonalization of the nonlinear phase
noise of (1) by the summation of N independently dis-
tributed random variables [16]. Fig. 3 shows a compari-
son of the p.d.f. for N = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 of ﬁber spans
[16] with the asymptotic case of (17). Using the SNR of
ρs = 18, Fig. 3 is plotted in logarithmic scale to show the
diﬀerence in the tail. Fig. 3 also provides an inset in lin-
ear scale of the same p.d.f. to show the diﬀerence around
the mean. The asymptotic p.d.f. of (17) with distributed
noise has the smallest spread in the tail as compared with
the p.d.f. with N discrete noise sources. The asymptotic

In practice, the p.d.f. of the re-

V. ERROR PROBABILITY OF DPSK SIGNAL

Binary DPSK signaling with interferometer based
direct-detection receiver has renewed interests recently
[9, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Optical ampliﬁed direct-detection
DPSK receiver had been studied by [28, 30, 31]. This
section studies the impact of nonlinear phase noise to bi-
nary DPSK signal. In order to derive the error probabil-
ity, the p.d.f. of the received phase, that is the summation
of both nonlinear phase noise and the phase of ampliﬁer
noise, is ﬁrst derived analytically.

In practice, the path diﬀerence τ

Fig. 4 shows the direct-detection receiver for DPSK
signal. The DPSK receiver uses a Mach-Zehnder inter-
ferometer in which the signal is splitted into two paths
and combined with a path diﬀerence of a symbol time
of T .
T must be
chosen such that exp(jω0τ ) = 1, where ω0 is the angu-
lar frequency of the signal [32]. Ideally, the optical ﬁlter
before the interferometer is assumed to be a match ﬁlter
to the transmitted signal. Two balanced photodetectors
are used to receive the photocurrent. There is a low-pass
ﬁlter to ﬁlter out the receiver noise. We assume that the
low-pass ﬁlter has a wide bandwidth and does not distort
the received signal.

≈

The analysis here just takes into account the ampliﬁer
noise from the same polarization as the signal [30] and
can also be applied to heterodyne receiver [31]. The re-
ceiver noise, including shot and thermal noise, is ignored.

A. Phase Distribution

Without loss of generality, in this section, the nor-
malized transmitted electric ﬁeld is assumed to be ~ξ0 =
(√ρs, 0) and θ0 = 0. Using the joint characteristic func-
tion of (33), the summation of the nonlinear phase noise
and the phase of ampliﬁer noise

φr = φNL + θn =

φ + θn

While the distribution of the phase of ampliﬁer noise
does not change due to the normalization of (3), the
distribution of the nonlinear phase noise changes due

T are the same.
The phases at t and t

−
T are i.i.d. random variables.

In practice, an interferometer based balanced receiver
of Fig. 4 gives a photocurrent or voltage proportional to
cos(∆Φr). The detector makes a decision on whether
cos(∆Φr) is positive or negative. This detector is equiv-
alent to make a decision on whether ∆Φr is within or
π/2. Error probability is calcu-
without the angle of
lated using the p.d.f. of the diﬀerential phase ∆Φr.

±

The addition or subtraction of two independent ran-
dom variables is equivalent to the multiplication of the
Fourier series coeﬃcients of the corresponding p.d.f. Us-
ing the Fourier series of (37), the p.d.f. of the diﬀerential
phase ∆Φr is

From (38), the random variable of ∆Φr is the diﬀerence
of two i.i.d. random variables. The p.d.f. for ∆Φr is sym-
metrical with respect to zero. The Fourier coeﬃcients of
ΨΦr (m)
|
|

2 are real numbers.

Using the Fourier series expansion like (39), the error
probability is found for DPSK signals with a noisy ref-
erence [18], phase error [33], or laser phase noise [19].
All previous studies [18, 19, 33] had phase noise or error
that is independent of the phase of the signal, or using
our symbol, the random variable ΦNL is independent of
Θn. Here, the problem is far more complicated because
of the dependence between the nonlinear phase noise ΦNL
and the phase of ampliﬁer noise of Θn.

In the coeﬃcients of (43), the conversion from conﬂu-
ent hypergeometric function to Bessel function is used
in [18, 33, 34, 35]. The complex coeﬃcients of λk (44)
are equivalent to the angular frequency depending SNR
parameters. Bessel functions with complex argument are
well-deﬁned [36].

C. Approximation of Independence

The coeﬃcients of (43) have a very complicated ex-
pression because of the dependence between the phase of
ampliﬁer noise and the nonlinear phase noise. Because
E
= 0, the phase of ampliﬁer noise and the
nonlinear phase noise are uncorrelated with each other.

Similar to the error probability in [18, 19, 33] when phase
noise is independent of signal phase, the approximated
error probability of (45) is simpler than the exact error
probability of (42) with coeﬃcients of (43).

Comparing the exact (42) and approximated (45) error
probability, two expressions are the same if the parame-
ter of λk (44) in the coeﬃcient of (43) is replaced by the
SNR of ρs. The parameter of λk is a complex number.
With nonlinear phase noise, the absolute value of
is
always smaller than the SNR ρs. The exact error proba-
bility of (42) is always larger than the approximated error
probability of (45).

Because of its simple expression, the approximated er-
ror probability (45) can be used together with the char-
acteristic functions with ﬁnite number of ﬁber spans [16].
The error probability with and without compensation
can be calculated using the approximated error proba-
bility of (45).

D. Numerical Results

Fig. 5 plots the exact (42) and approximated (45) error
probability as a function of the SNR for DPSK signal

with nonlinear phase noise. Fig. 5 also gives the error
probability of DPSK signal without nonlinear phase noise
of [18], [25,

5.2.8], [34]

§

pe =

.

(46)

From Fig. 5, the approximated error probability of (45)
is always smaller than that of the exact error probability
9, the diﬀer-
of (42). For the same error probability of 10−
ence in terms of SNR is less than 0.2 dB, an insigniﬁcant
discrepancy for most practical applications. The approx-
imated error probability based on the independence as-
sumption is more accurate if either the nonlinear phase
noise or the phase of ampliﬁer noise is the dominant noise
source. As shown in Fig. 5, the discrepancy between the
exact and approximated error probability is smaller for
small or large nonlinear phase noise than, for example,
with a mean nonlinear phase shift of <ΦNL>= 0.75 rad.
The variance of the phase of ampliﬁer noise is approxi-
mately equal to 1/ρs. The variance of the nonlinear phase
noise is approximately equal to 4 <ΦNL>2 ρs/3. When
the mean nonlinear phase shift < ΦNL > is about 0.87
rad, the variance of nonlinear phase noise and the phase
of ampliﬁer noise are more or less the same. The inde-
pendence approximation gives the largest discrepancy in
a mean nonlinear phase shift from 0.5 to 1 rad.

The error probability of Fig. 5 is calculated using Mat-
lab. The series summation of (42) and (45) can be cal-
14 with
culated to an error probability of 10−
an accuracy of three to four signiﬁcant digits. Symbolic
mathematical software can provide better accuracy by
using variable precision arithmetic in the calculation of
low error probability.

VI. COMPENSATION OF NONLINEAR PHASE
NOISE

As shown in the helix shape scattergram of Figs. 1,
nonlinear phase noise is correlated with the received in-
tensity. The received intensity can be used to compensate
for nonlinear phase noise. Ideally, the optimal compen-
sator should minimize the error probability of the system
after compensation.
If the joint p.d.f. of the received
phase and the received intensity of pΦr ,Y (θ, y) is avail-
able, the optimal compensator or detector is given by
the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion
[21,

5.2] to minimize the error probability.

In this section, the compensator is optimized in term
of the variance, or mean-square error criterion, of the
residual nonlinear phase noise. The optimal compensator
is derived with and without the linearity constraint.

noise φα as compared with the p.d.f. of N = 4, 8, 16, 32, and
64 ﬁber spans. The p.d.f. in linear scale is shown in the inset.

The p.d.f. of the residual normalized nonlinear phase
noise is the inverse Fourier transform of ΨΦαopt(ν).

The p.d.f. of the residual nonlinear phase noise for ﬁ-
nite number of ﬁber spans was derived by modeling the
residual nonlinear phase noise φα as the summation of N
independently distributed random variables [16]. Fig. 6
shows a comparison of the p.d.f. for N = 4, 8, 16, 32, and
64 of ﬁber spans [16] with the distributed case of (53).
The residual nonlinear phase noise is scaled by the mean
normalized phase shift of <Φ>= ρs + 1/2. Using a SNR
of ρs = 18, Fig. 6 is plotted in logarithmic scale to show
the diﬀerence in the tail. Fig. 6 also provides an inset
in linear scale of the same p.d.f. to show the diﬀerence
around the mean. Like that of Fig. 3, the asymptotic
p.d.f. for residual nonlinear phase noise of Fig. 6 is also
very accurate for N
32 ﬁber spans. Unlike that of
Fig. 3, the asymptotic p.d.f. for residual nonlinear phase
noise of Fig. 6 have slightly larger spread then that of the
ﬁnite cases. The mean of the residual nonlinear phase
noise is about 0.5(ρs + 1/2), the same as that of (51).
Comparing Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, with linear compensation,
both the mean and STD of the residual nonlinear phase
noise is about half of that of the nonlinear phase noise
before compensation.

linear compensation curve is <Φαopt> +αoptr2. The non-
linear compensation curve is E
of (56). In Fig. 7,
the received intensity of y = r2 is scaled by the corre-
sponding SNR of ρs but the compensation phase is not
scaled. The inset also shows the corresponding curves
when both compensation phase and the received inten-
sity are scaled by the corresponding SNR of ρs, giving
three almost overlapped curves. From Fig. 7, when the
normalized received intensity is between 0.5ρs to 2ρs, the
linear and nonlinear compensators have almost no diﬀer-
ence. Because the mean normalized received intensity is
ρs + 1, the linear and nonlinear compensators are almost
the same when the intensity is between half and twice
the mean of the received intensity. When the received
intensity is either beyond the range of 0.5ρs or 2ρs, the
nonlinear compensator always gives a smaller compensa-
tion phase than that of the linear compensator. In the
scaled inset, all the curves have a slope of about 1/2.

Fig. 8 plots the standard deviation (STD) of the nor-
malized nonlinear phase noise with and without compen-
sation as a function of SNR ρs. The STD of residual
nonlinear phase noise of σΦαopt and σΦe , with linear and
nonlinear compensator, are shown as almost overlapped
solid and dotted lines, respectively. The STD of nonlin-
ear compensator is about 0.2% less than that of linear

residual nonlinear phase noise, Fig. 8 shows that the op-
timal nonlinear compensator has the same performance
as the linear compensator. The variance of the residual
nonlinear phase noise is contributed mostly from the re-
gion when the nonlinear phase noise is around its mean of
ρs+1/2. As from Fig. 7, the linear and nonlinear compen-
sation curves have no signiﬁcant diﬀerence from 0.5ρs to
2ρs. The variance of the residual nonlinear phase should

have no signiﬁcant diﬀerence whether linear or nonlinear
compensator is used.

Fig. 9 compares the p.d.f. of the residual nonlinear
phase noise with linear and nonlinear compensation. The
residual nonlinear phase noise is scaled by the mean nor-
malized nonlinear phase shift of <Φ>= ρs + 1/2. The
asymptotic p.d.f. with linear compensator of Fig. 6 is re-
produced in Fig. 9 and shifted by the mean of <Φαopt> of
(51), giving a better comparison to the residual nonlinear
phase with nonlinear compensator.

If Fig. 9 is plotted in linear scale, the two p.d.f. curves
overlap. The major diﬀerence of the p.d.f. is at the tail of
the negative phase. The p.d.f. using the nonlinear com-
pensator has a smaller tail probability than that of lin-
ear compensator if the phase is less than
0.4(ρs + 1/2).
Although the small discrepancy at the tail does not af-
fect the variance of Fig. 8, nonlinear compensator pro-
vides smaller error probability than that of linear com-
pensator. Comparing Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, the variance of
residual nonlinear phase noise is useful but may not be
the only criterion to characterize the performance of the

−

compensation scheme.

The approximated error probability of (45) can be
used with the characteristic function of residual nonlin-
ear phase noise after linear or nonlinear compensator of
ΨΦαopt (ν) (53) and ΨΦe (ν) (59), respectively. While the
residual nonlinear phase noise may slightly depend on
the phase of ampliﬁer noise, the dependence is weak and
may be ignored.

VII. CONCLUSION

The joint characteristic functions of the nonlinear
phase noise with electric ﬁeld, received intensity, and the
phase of ampliﬁer noise are derived analytically the ﬁrst
time. The nonlinear phase noise is modeled asymptot-
ically as a distributed process for large number of ﬁber
spans. Replacing the span by span summation of the
nonlinear phase noise by an integration, the distributed

12

assumption is valid if the number of ﬁber spans is larger
than 32. Using the joint characteristic function of the
nonlinear phase noise with the phase of ampliﬁer noise,
the error probability of DPSK signal is calculated as a se-
ries. The error probability of DPSK signal is simpliﬁed by
assuming that the nonlinear phase noise is independent of
the phase of ampliﬁer noise. When the received intensity
is used to compensate the nonlinear phase noise, based
on the principle to minimize the variance of the resid-
ual nonlinear phase noise, the optimal linear and nonlin-
ear compensators are derived analytically using the joint
characteristic function of the nonlinear phase noise with
the received intensity. While the residual nonlinear phase
noise of both linear and nonlinear compensators has the
almost same variance, the tail probability of the residual
nonlinear phase noise of nonlinear compensator is smaller
than that of linear compensator, leading to smaller error
probability.

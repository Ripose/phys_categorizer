Abstract

We discuss the origin of the Schott energy in the Abraham-Lorentz version of electrodynamic

radiation theory and how it can be used to explain some apparent paradoxes. We also derive

the generalization of this quantity for the Ford-O’Connell equation, which has the merit of being

derived exactly from a microscopic Hamiltonian for an electron with structure and has been shown

to be free of the problems associated with the Abraham-Lorentz theory. We emphasize that the

instantaneous power supplied by the applied force not only gives rise to radiation (acceleration

ﬁelds), but it can change the kinetic energy of the electron and change the Schott energy of the

velocity ﬁelds. The important role played by boundary conditions is noted.

INTRODUCTION

Since its introduction in 1912,1 there has been much confusion concerning the nature of

the Schott energy, despite the fact that some authors2,3,4 have presented a clear explanation

of its origin.

It arises from the fact that the power supplied by an external force to a

charged particle not only contributes to the energy radiated (acceleration ﬁelds) but also

to the velocity ﬁelds. This feature is not connected with the well-known deﬁciencies of

the Abraham-Lorentz theory (runaway solutions, etc.). Previous discussions of the Schott

energy arose in the context of the Abraham-Lorentz equation of motion for a radiating

electron. In this paper we deﬁne a (generalized) Schott energy that is applicable not only to

the Abraham-Lorentz theory but to all theories of a radiating electron. To do so, we start

by recalling the classical Newtonian equation of motion for a particle of mass M under the
action of an external ﬁeld ~f (t):

(1)

(2)

M~a = ~f ,

T =

Mv2,

2

where ~a is the acceleration. The only eﬀect of f (t) is to change the kinetic energy T of the

particle, where

and v is the velocity. We stress these elementary facts because they are often overlooked
in the development of radiation theories for a charged particle because for ~f (t) = 0, the

equation of motion should reduce to M~a = 0. In particular, this requirement is not obeyed

by the Abraham-Lorentz equation (so that runaway solutions emerge) whereas it is obeyed

by the Ford-O’Connell theory as we will discuss.

We consider an electron of charge e subject to a external force ~f(t). The total work done
by ~f (t) during an arbitrary time interval consists of three parts (1) the change in kinetic

energy ∆T (which is independent of e), (2) the radiated energy, which is the energy in the

acceleration or far ﬁelds,5 and (3) the change in energy in the velocity or near ﬁelds,5 which

does not give rise to radiation. This change can be positive or negative.

The energy in the velocity ﬁelds is the Schott energy. Thus, at any time t, the instan-
taneous power, P (t), supplied by ~f (t) does not contribute just to the radiated energy. A

feature of the Schott energy is that its time derivative appears in the expression for P (t)

so that “. . . if we. . . consider only intervals over which the system returns to its initial state,

then the energy in the velocity ﬁelds is the same at both ends, and the only net loss is in the

2

form of radiation. . . ”4 That is, the Schott energy is the energy contributed to the velocity

ﬁelds by the external ﬁeld and does not contribute to the radiated energy (which is due to

acceleration ﬁelds).

A related question is whether or not radiation can occur for constant acceleration (because

the Larmor result for the radiated energy depends only on the acceleration squared whereas

the radiation reaction term in the Abraham-Lorentz equation of motion depends on the

rate of change of the acceleration). The solution to this apparent paradox is summarized

succintly in Ref. 2 where it is noted that “. . . the radiated energy and the work of the

radiation friction are not equal to each other in the nonstationary state,” due again to the

existence of the Schott energy. For that reason, it is desirable to consider energy exchange

between the particle and the ﬁeld at each instant of time, rather than using conservation

laws integrated over time.

There has also been a long-standing recognition that the Abraham-Lorentz analysis has a

fundamental ﬂaw related to the existence of runaway solutions, which are a manifestation of

the fact that causality is violated.5 A solution to the latter problem was presented by Ford

and O’Connell6,7,8,9 who pointed out the necessity of ascribing structure to the electron.

Their solution led to a second-order equation of motion that is simple and well-behaved and

incorporates quantum and ﬂuctuation eﬀects and the presence of a potential V . Here we

conﬁne ourselves to the non-relativistic classical case with V = 0, which is the case most

often considered in the literature.4,5

In Sec. II we consider the generalization of the Schott energy for the radiation reaction

force Fd (the subscript d indicates its dissipative nature) without specifying its speciﬁc form.

A key feature of our analysis is that because the electron motion and the rate of radiation

are continually changing in time, we consider conservation of power (the power P (t) supplied

by the external force to the particle is equal to the rate of change of the particle’s kinetic

energy plus the rate of change of the velocity ﬁelds and the acceleration ﬁelds), as distinct

from energy (which is integrated power). The latter gives less information and obscures the

nonstationary aspect of the problem. As a result, we ﬁnd that although the radiated power
depends on d ~f/dt, the integrated radiated power, that is, the radiated energy, does not. In

Secs. III and IV we apply our general analysis to the Abraham-Lorentz and Ford-O’Connell

theories and describe the physical nature of the generalized Schott terms. We also emphasize

why the Ford-O’Connell theory is superior to the Abraham-Lorentz theory. Our conclusions

3

are presented in Sec. V.

II. GENERAL EQUATION OF MOTION FOR A RADIATING ELECTRON

The equation of a radiating electron may be written in the form

where ~a is the acceleration, ~f is the applied force, and ~Fd is a dissipative force arising from

the back reaction due to the emitted radiation. All of these quantities are functions of time.
The instantaneous power supplied by the external force ~f (t) to the electron is

M~a = ~f + ~Fd,

P (t) = ~f(t) · ~v(t),

where ~v(t) is the velocity. From Eq. (3), we obtain

P (t) = M~a · ~v − ~v · ~Fd

=

dT
dt

− ~v · ~Fd ≡ PN (t) + Pd(t),

where the kinetic energy T is given by Eq. (2). The rate of change of the kinetic energy of

the electron, PN (t), arises from the application of Newton’s law when Fd = 0. Our main

interest is in the Pd(t) term and as we will discuss, this term contributes not only to the

radiated electromagnetic energy but also to the energy in the velocity ﬁelds.

The total work done by the external force during the time interval t2 − t1 is

W ≡ W (t1, t2) =

P (t′)dt′

t2

t2

Z

t1

=

Z

t1

Pd(t′)dt′ + ∆T ≡ Wd + ∆T,

where ∆T = T (t2)−T (t1) is the change in the kinetic energy. Thus Pd(t) is the instantaneous

power delivered to the ﬁelds by the external force (only part of which goes into radiated

energy); when Pd(t) = 0 there is no radiated energy. Note that Wd is the total integrated

energy transmitted to the ﬁelds.

It is useful to write

Wd = Wv + WR,

Wd =

Pd(t′)dt′ = −
Z

~v(t′) · ~Fd(t′)dt′,

(8)

Wv is the work done on the velocity ﬁelds, and WR is the radiated energy (associated with

the acceleration ﬁelds). In other words, the total work done by the external ﬁeld on the

electron at time t consists of three parts. The total work changes the kinetic energy of the

electron and concomitantly contributes both to the acceleration ﬁelds (which gives rise to

radiation) and the velocity ﬁelds (which do not give rise to radiation).

III. ABRAHAM-LORENTZ THEORY

The Abraham-Lorentz equation of motion5 gives

so that Eq. (3) reduces to

~Fd = Mτ

d~a
dt

,

M~a = ~f + Mτ

d~a
dt

,

where τ = 2e2/(3Mc3) = 6 × 10−24 s is proportional to the time it takes light to travel

the classical radius of the electron. We see that when the acceleration is constant in the
Abraham-Lorentz theory, ~Fd is zero and thus from Eq. (5) there is no radiated energy. More

generally, from Eqs. (5) and (9) we obtain

Pd(t) = −Mτ~v ·

= −Mτ

PL = Mτ a2,

where

is the familiar Larmor rate of radiation,5 and

Es = Mτ (~v · ~a),

is the Schott energy. Note that the total time derivative of Es appears in the expression for

Pd(t). It follows that

Wd =

PLdt − {Es(t2) − Es(t1)}

PLdt − Mτ {~v(t2) · ~a(t2) − ~v(t1) · ~a(t1)}.

Thus, if the accelerations are equal at times t2 and t1 then Wv = 0 and Wd = WR, the usual

result for the radiated energy. Because the initial and ﬁnd velocities are generally diﬀerent,

we see from Eq. (6) that W = WR + ∆T . The same scenario approximately occurs when

t1 and t2 correspond to the times at which the applied force is zero and thus from Eqs. (3)

and (9) the acceleration is of order τ and hence very small.

In addition, the Abraham-Lorentz equation (10) has serious problems.

In particular,
when ~f = 0, it is clear that Eq. (10) does not reduce to Newton’s equation as it should, and

consequently the well-known runaway solutions emerge. We now turn to the Ford-O’Connell

theory which does not manifest this problem.

IV. FORD-O’CONNELL THEORY

The Ford-O’Connell theory6,7,8,9 is based on a rigorous microscopic approach whose start-

ing point is the universally accepted Hamiltonian of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics

generalized to allow for electron structure.10,11 The use of Heisenberg’s equation of motion

(or the corresponding Poisson equations of motion in the classical case) leads to an equa-

tion of motion that incorporates electron structure and quantum eﬀects and an arbitrary

potential V .6 In the classical limit and for V = 0, the Ford-O’Connell equation of motion

reduces to the Abraham-Lorentz equation in the limit of a point particle (and thus, as a

bonus, we have the ﬁrst Hamiltonian derivation of the Abraham-Lorentz equation). More

generally, electron structure is taken into account by incorporating a form factor6,10 (the

Fourier transform of the charge distribution), which is written in terms of a large cutoﬀ

frequency Ω. The point electron limit corresponds to Ω → ∞. More generally, small Ω
implies an extended electron structure. As shown in Ref. 6, values of Ω larger than τ −1

lead

e

to violation of causality. This violation shows that the problem with the Abraham-Lorentz
theory arises from the assumption of a point electron. In addition, choosing Ω = τ −1

(cor-

e

responding to the maximum allowed value of Ω and hence to the smallest electron structure

consistent with causality), leads in the classical limit and for V = 0 to

so that Eq. (1) becomes

~Fd = τ

d ~f
dt

,

M~a = ~f + τ

d ~f
dt

.

(16)

(17a)

(17c)

(18)

(19)

Note that ~Fd depends on both the electron (through the factor τ ) and the external ﬁeld.

This dependence contrasts with the corresponding result given by Eq. (9) for the Abraham-

Lorentz theory, where the external force does not appear explicitly. Also in the Ford-
O’Connell theory, when the applied force ~f (t) is constant, ~Fd is zero and thus from Eq. (3)

we see that there is no radiation. It also follows that we can write

Pd(t) = −τ (~v ·

) = −τ

is the result obtained in Refs. 7 and 8 for the rate of radiation. In fact, Ford-O’Connell

used two diﬀerent derivations in obtaining Eq. (18), one based on energy conservation7 and

another based on a generalization of Larmor’s derivation to include electron structure.8 Also

EFO = τ (~v · ~f ) −

f 2

is the generalization of the Schott energy. It follows that the negative of the time derivative

of the Schott energy is the power fed into the velocity ﬁelds by the external force.

It

immediately follows that the integrated power is given by

Wd =

PFOdt − [EFO(t2) − EFO(t1)].

(20)

We note that EFO diﬀers from Es by terms of order τ 2 and that EFO also appears as a

total time derivative in the expression for the instantaneous power radiated. In contrast

to Es, EFO vanishes exactly when the applied force is turned on and oﬀ (a more physically

appealing boundary condition than in the Abraham-Lorentz analysis), in which case Wv = 0

and Wd is equal to the ﬁrst term in Eq. (20), which is the result obtained in Refs. 7 and

8. Thus, for a constant external ﬁeld, Pd is always zero except when the ﬁeld is turned on

and oﬀ, and it is then that energy is radiated with an average rate given by Eq. (18). We

point out that Eq. (18) was obtained in Ref. 7 by integrating the equation of motion (16)

and then using energy conservation. The same result was veriﬁed in Ref. 8 by generalizing

Larmor’s radiation theory to incorporate electron structure.

V. CONCLUSION

The Schott energy and its generalization corresponds to energy given to or taken from

the velocity ﬁelds and always occurs as a total time derivative in the expression for the

instantaneous power supplied by the external force. Thus the total work done by the ap-

plied force is only equal to the radiated energy plus the change in kinetic energy when the

boundary conditions ensure that the change in the Schott energy (the energy of the ve-

locity ﬁelds) is equal to zero during the time interval of interest. These conditions occur

naturally in the Ford-O’Connell theory (as distinct from the Abraham-Lorentz theory) be-

cause f (t) is zero at the initial and ﬁnal times. Moreover, it is immediately clear from the

Ford-O’Connell equation of motion (16), that when f = constant, Eq. (16) reduces to the

Newtonian equation of motion (1). In other words, there is no radiation reaction term in

the equation of motion reﬂecting the fact that there is no radiation when f = constant, a

conclusion that also emerges from a relativistic generalization.12 This result is also consis-

tent with the conclusion13 that an oscillator moving under a constant force with respect to

zero-temperature vacuum does not radiate despite the fact that it thermalizes at the Unruh

temperature. Finally, we remark that when quantum eﬀects are taken into account there

are additional ﬂuctuating force terms in the equation of motion.14

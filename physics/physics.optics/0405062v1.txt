We describe the experimental implementation of a superluminal (i.e. faster than light in vacuo)
polarization current distribution that both oscillates and undergoes centripetal acceleration. Theo-
retical treatments predict that the radiation emitted by each volume element of the superluminally-
moving distribution pattern will comprise a ˇCerenkov-like envelope with two sheets that meet along
a cusp. Correspondingly, the emission from the experimental machine is found to be tightly beamed
in both the azimuthal and polar directions. The beaming is frequency independent and has a
sharply-deﬁned and unchanging geometry determined only by the speed and path of the moving
distribution pattern, i.e. by the parameters governing the structure of the ˇCerenkov-like envelopes.
In addition, over a restricted range of angles, we detect the presence of cusps in the emitted radi-
ation. These, which are due to the focusing of wave fronts on a propagating space curve, result in
the reception, during a short time period, of radiation emitted over a considerably longer period
of (retarded) source time. The intensity of the radiation at these angles was observed to decline
more slowly with increasing distance from the source than would the emission from a conventional
antenna. The angular distribution of the emitted radiation and the properties associated with the
cusps are in good quantitative agreement with theoretical models of superluminal sources once the
eﬀect of reﬂections from the earth’s surface are taken into account. In particular, the prediction that
the beaming and the slow decay should extend into the far zone has been tested to several hundred
Fresnel distances (Rayleigh ranges). The excellent agreement between the theoretical calculations
and the data suggests that the apparatus achieves precise and reproducible control of the polariza-
tion current and that similar machines could be of general interest for studying and utilizing the
novel eﬀects associated with superluminal electrodynamics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Serious scientiﬁc interest in the emission of electromagnetic radiation by charged particles moving faster than the
speed of light in vacuo began with the work of Sommerfeld in 1904 and 1905 [1]. The timing of this work was perhaps
unfortunate, as the special theory of relativity was published within a few months [2]; any known particle that has
a charge has also a rest mass and so cannot be accelerated through the speed of light. Moreover, an additional
conceptual barrier discouraged further work: even a massless particle cannot move faster than light in vacuo if it is
charged, because if it did, it would give rise to an inﬁnitely strong electromagnetic ﬁeld on the envelope of the wave
fronts that emanate from it [3].

By and large, this ﬁeld remained dormant until Ginzburg and colleagues [3, 4, 5] pointed out that, though no
superluminal source of electromagnetic ﬁelds can be point-like, there are no physical principles preventing extended
faster-than-light sources. The coordinated motion of aggregates of subluminally-moving charged particles can give
rise to macroscopic polarization currents whose distribution patterns move superluminally [3, 4, 5]. Further relevant
progress occurred with the theoretical prediction that extended sources that move faster than their own waves could be
responsible for the extreme properties of both the electromagnetic emission from pulsars (rapidly spinning, magnetized
neutron stars) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and the acoustic emission by supersonic rotors and propellers [11]. Finally, theoretical
treatments of a particular class of source of this type [12, 13] were stimulated by the design and construction of the
apparatus that is the subject of the current paper. This apparatus implements an extended polarization current
distribution that has the time dependence of a traveling wave with centripetally-accelerated superluminal motion and
an oscillating amplitude. Refs. [12, 13] point out several distinctive characteristics of the emission by such sources:

1. The radiation emitted from each volume element of the superluminally-moving polarization-current distribution
pattern comprises a ˇCerenkov-like envelope with two sheets that meet along a cusp. The combined eﬀect of the
volume elements leads to a frequency-independent beaming in both the azimuthal and polar directions whose

2

geometry is determined by the structure of the ˇCerenkov-like envelopes [6, 12, 13].

2. The above-mentioned cusps, which spiral upwards and outwards from the source into the far zone [6, 12, 13],
result from the centripetal acceleration of the source; without acceleration, the wave fronts would merely pile up
on a two-dimensional envelope [6, 11]. The cusps result in the reception, during a short time period, of radiation
emitted over a considerably longer period of (retarded) source time. Consequently, the intensity of the radiation
at these angles declines more slowly with increasing distance from the source than would the emission from a
conventional antenna. Note, however, that energy conservation is not violated; large intensities on the cusp are
compensated by weaker radiation ﬁelds elsewhere. The propagating cusp is being reconstructed constantly from
conventional (i.e. spherically-decaying) waves that combine and then disperse.

3. Under certain conditions, the emitted radiation contains a broad spectral distribution of high frequencies that
are not present in the synthesis of the moving, oscillating polarization current. These originate from the
centripetal acceleration, and from space-time discontinuities forced on the polarization-current distribution by
the constraints of its circular path.

Based on the above ideas, we have constructed an experimental realization of an extended, oscillating superluminal
source that undergoes centripetal acceleration. The present paper describes the basic principles of the machine, and
its use to demonstrate the ﬁrst two theoretical ﬁndings listed above; the high frequency emission will be the subject of
a future work. We ﬁnd that the emission of the source is well described by the models of Refs. [12, 13], conﬁrming the
validity of extended superluminal polarization currents as precisely controllable sources of electromagnetic radiation
with novel properties.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a description of the experimental considerations necessary to
understand the data from the superluminal source. Since practical superluminal sources are relatively novel, and
since the raw experimental data are aﬀected by the proximity of the source to the ground in a way familar only to
communications engineers [14], this section is by necessity rather detailed; without a thorough explanation of these
eﬀects, the experimental data are not readily understood. Within it, Subsection II A describes how the polarization
current distribution is created and animated (set in motion) at superluminal speeds within a curved strip of alumina.
The experimental geometry, and in particular its relationship to the coordinate systems used in the theoretical
papers [6, 12, 13] is discussed in Subsection II B, whilst the detection system and the eﬀects of interference from the
ground are described in Subsection II C. Experimental results commence in Section III, which describes data that
conclusively demonstrate the three-dimensional angular distributions of the ˇCerenkov-like envelopes emitted by the
source. Section IV describes range tests exhibiting the non-spherically-decaying radiation close to the cusp; in spite of
the non-ideal nature of the experimental machine and the measurement geometry (which complicated by interference
from the ground) it is possible to conclusively identify this feature within the emission data. A discussion, conclusions
and summary are given in Section V. The paper ends with an Appendix describing the mathematical treatment of
interference due to reﬂections from the ground. In addition, the Appendix details the ﬁtting methods used to obtain
the exponent of the non-spherical decay associated with the cusps, and summarizes the parts of the theory given in
Refs. [12, 13] that are used to model the beaming observed in the experimental data.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

A. Animation of a superluminal polarization current

The ﬁrst step in investigating superluminal eﬀects is to identify a source that can travel faster than the speed of
light in vacuo without violating Einstein’s theory of special relativity [2]. The required source explicitly appears in
the Amp`ere-Maxwell equation, which underlies the emission of electromagnetic radiation [15, 16]:

∇ × H = Jfree +

= Jfree + ǫ0

(SI units).

Here H is the magnetic ﬁeld strength, Jfree is the current density of free charges, D is the displacement, E is the
electric ﬁeld and P is the polarization; the term ∂P/∂t represents the polarization current density. An oscillating or
accelerating current density Jfree emits electromagnetic radiation (i.e. it acts as a source) and is well-understood; this
is the basis of conventional radio transmission [15, 17] and the use of synchrotrons as light sources [18]. However,
as a current density of free charges is composed of particles such as electrons or protons, Einstein’s theory of special
relativity naturally forbids such a source from traveling faster than the speed of light. By contrast, there is no such
restriction on a polarization current. Fig. 1(a)-(b) shows a simpliﬁed dielectric solid containing negative and positive
ions. In (b), a spatially-varying electric ﬁeld has been applied, causing the positive and negative ions to move in

opposite directions. A ﬁnite polarization P has therefore been induced. If the spatially-varying ﬁeld is made to move,
the polarized region moves with it; we have a traveling “wave” of P (and also, by virtue of the time dependence
imposed by movement, a traveling wave of ∂P/∂t). Note that this “wave” can move arbitrarily fast (i.e. faster than
the speed of light) because the individual ions suﬀer only small displacements perpendicular to the direction of the
wave and therefore do not themselves move faster than the speed of light.

Thus far, the bulk of the theoretical analysis of superluminal light sources has been carried out for rotating, oscil-

lating polarization current distributions [12, 13], which possess a polarization given (in cylindrical polar coordinates)
by [23]

P(r, ϕ, z, t) = s(r, z) cos[m(ϕ − ωt)] cos Ωt.

Here s is a vector ﬁeld describing the orientation of the polarization; it vanishes outside the active volume of the
source [12]. The other parameters are deﬁned in Table I. The experimental superluminal source described in this

be polarized by the applied electric ﬁeld) on top of which is placed an array of metal electrodes; underneath is a
continuous ground plate. This forms what is in eﬀect a series of capacitors (a schematic is shown in Fig. 1(c)-(e)).
Each upper “capacitor” electrode is connected to an individual ampliﬁer; turning the ampliﬁers on and oﬀ in sequence
moves a polarized region along the dielectric (Fig. 1(c)-(d)).

In practice, the dielectric in the experimental source is a strip corresponding to a 10◦ arc of a circle of average
radius a = 10.025 m, made from alumina 10 mm thick and 50 mm across. Above the alumina strip, there are 41
upper electrodes of mean width 42.6 mm, with centers 44.6 mm apart. Whilst the ground plate is the same width as
the dielectric strip, each electrode covers only the inner 10 mm of the upper surface (shown schematically in Fig 1(e)).
This has the eﬀect of producing a polarization in the alumina with both radial and vertical components (see Eq. 2).
In the discussion that follows, we shall refer to the assembly consisting of groundplate, dielectric and electrodes as
“the array” for convenience.

Each upper electrode of the array is driven by an individual shielded ampliﬁer just behind it; to simulate Eq. 2, the

jth (j = 1, 2, 3....) electrode is supplied with a voltage

Vj = V0 cos[η(j∆t − t)] cos Ωt.

(3)

Comparison with Eq. 2 shows that the angular frequency η = mω; ∆t = ∆ϕ/ω, where ∆ϕ = π/(18 × 40) is the
angle subtended by the eﬀective center separation of adjacent electrodes. The velocity v with which the polarization
current distribution propagates along the dielectric is set by adjusting ∆t to give v = a∆ϕ/∆t (see Fig. 2(a)). Given
the dimensions of the experimental array, v > c is achieved for ∆t < 148.8 ps. (At this point it should be stated that
the modulation scheme used to animate the superluminal polarization current is quite distinct from any used thus far
in conventional phased-array antennae [19].)

The application of the electrode voltages produces a stepped approximation to a sinusoidal polarization-current wave
that moves at speed v along the dielectric (see Fig. 2(a)). Detailed analysis of this type of waveform (see Ref. [12],
Appendix) shows that the dominant emission is almost identical to that produced by a pure sinusoidal wave with the
same wavelength and amplitude. Most of the emission occurs at two frequencies, f± = |Ω ± η|/2π ≡ |Ω ± mω|/2π, as
indicated in Table I.

As mentioned above, the speed of the source (i.e. the speed at which the sinusoidal polarization current “wave”
propagates along the dielectric) is set by the parameter ∆t. Experimentally, this is done by observing the time
dependence of the voltages on each electrode (Figure 2(b)) using a high-speed oscilloscope.

Finally, it should be emphasised that great care was taken to minimize unwanted radiation from the ampliﬁers,
cabling and signal generators of the apparatus to ensure that the detected signal was dominated by the emission
from the polarization current. Steps taken included proper encasing of all of the signal generation equipment, the
enclosure of the 41 ampliﬁers inside thick copper shields (not shown in Fig. 1) and the correct impedance matching
of connections.

B. The experimental geometry

To map out the spatial distribution of the radiation from the superluminal source, one would ideally position the
array in empty space and move a detector to points around it, covering a comprehensive range of angles and distances.
However, practical experiments must be conducted close to the earth’s surface, where reﬂections from the ground are
a complicating factor [14] (see Appendix); numerous tests showed that highly reproducible data are obtained when
the “ground” under the path between array and detector is smooth, level and of a uniform quality [20]. After trials at
several locations, the bituminised macadam surface of an airﬁeld runway (Turweston Aerodrome, near Northampton,
UK) was found to be almost ideal in providing a substantial length of well-characterized surface. All of the experiments
reported in the current paper employ the runway, which is approximately 900 m long and 20 m wide. A change in
slope about two-thirds of the way along the runway restricts the range tests reported in Section IV to distances of
600 m or less. However, measurements of the angular distribution of the radiated power from the array (Section III)
employed the full length of 900 m.

FIG. 2: (a) The upper curve shows the instantaneous values of the voltages on the 41 upper electrodes of the array; η/2π =
552.653 MHz and ∆t = 140 ps, corresponding to v ≈ 1.064c for a = 10.025 m and ∆ϕ = π/(18 × 40) (see Eq. 3). The
resulting polarizations under the electrodes will be proportional to these voltages. The lower curve (oﬀset for clarity) gives the
instantaneous voltages 420 ps later; the polarization “wave” has moved along the dielectric. (Note that the cos Ωt term in Eq. 3
hardly changes during this time.) (b) Example of the time-dependent voltages on array electrodes 20 and 21 (upper curves)
and 20 and 26 (lower curves) for the same parameters as in (a). Note that the lower-frequency temporal modulation of each
electrode voltage produced by the second cosine term in Eq. 3 (dotted curves) is in phase for all electrodes.

The geometry of the runway dictates that the best conﬁguration for measuring the spatial and angular distribution
of the radiation is to ﬁx the position of the detector (on the runway, at a distance R from the source) and to change
the orientation of the array to access a full range of polar and azimuthal angles. This is accomplished by placing the
array on a platform that tilts about a horizontal-axis pivot at one end; this is in turn ﬁxed on a turntable that can
rotate about a vertical axis.

It is possible to mount the array on the platform in two conﬁgurations. In the ﬁrst, the array plane is vertical
(Fig. 3(a)), so that its long axis can be tilted (about the horizontal pivot) to an angle φV with respect to horizontal;
the turntable is then rotated about a vertical axis so that the array plane makes an angle ϑV (in the horizontal
plane) with the line connecting the detector at P and the array center. In the second conﬁguration, the array plane
is initially horizontal (Fig. 3(b)); the array plane is then tilted using the horizontal pivot to an angle ϑH with respect
to horizontal. The turntable is then rotated about a vertical axis so that the projection of the long axis of the array
on the horizontal plane makes an angle φH with the line connecting the detector at P and the array center.

Finally, to aid comparison of experiment and theory, it is necessary to relate the experimental spherical polar
coordinates (R, ϑV, φV) and (R, ϑH, φH), which are measured relative to the array center, to the cylindrical and
spherical polar coordinates used to evaluate the integrals in the Appendix and in Refs. [12, 13]. In the latter papers,
each volume element of the superluminal source distribution traverses a complete circular orbit centered at the origin
of the coordinate system, and the radial distances to the individual source elements and to the observation point at
(RP, θP, ϕP) are speciﬁed with respect to the common center of these circular orbits (see Fig. 3(c) and (d)). Although
the experimental source does not encompass a complete circle, the high degree of symmetry represented by this
coordinate system greatly facilitates the computation of the integrals in the Appendix. The relationship between the
experimental coordinates and the coordinate system used in the Appendix is shown in Figs. 3(c) and (d).

FIG. 3: Left: the coordinates used to measure the spatial distribution of radiation from the array. In the experiments ((a),(b)),
the detector is at a ﬁxed point P, distance R from the array; the array is placed on a platform tilting about a horizontal axis
pivot that is in turn ﬁxed to a turntable rotating about a vertical axis. In (a), the array plane is vertical; its long axis is tilted
to an angle φV with respect to horizontal. The turntable is rotated about a vertical axis so that the array plane makes an angle
ϑV (in the horizontal plane) with the line connecting P and the array center. In (b), the array plane is initially horizontal;
the array plane is then tilted to an angle ϑH with respect to horizontal. The turntable is rotated about the vertical axis so
that the projection of the long axis of the array on the horizontal plane makes an angle φH with the line connecting P and
the array center. Note that the coordinate systems are not equivalent; tan φV = tan φH/ cos ϑH and sin ϑV = sin ϑH cos φH.

coordinates RP, θP, ϕP used in the Appendix. The arrow indicates the direction of propagation of the polarization current

C. Detector system, array and detector heights, and interference from ground reﬂections

The detector was a Schwarzbeck Mess-Elektronik UHA 9105 half-wave tuned dipole antenna, optimized for the
frequency range 300 MHz to 1 GHz. and mounted on a mobile wooden tower that allowed it to be ﬁxed at varying
heights hD above the ground. The antenna was ﬁtted with an internal coaxial BAL-UN to ensure good impedance
matching with an external load and was connected via a 6 m long impedance-matched coaxial cable (50 Ω) to an
Anritsu MS2711B portable spectrum analyser. The background noise ﬂoor with this equipment was between -120
and -130 dBm, depending on weather conditions at the airﬁeld.

In the current paper, the settings of the experimental machine are such that the emitted radiation is polarized
chieﬂy in directions parallel to the plane of the array. When the array is orientated as in Fig. 3(a), the detector aerial
(see below) is arranged to detect vertically-polarized radiation; if the array is orientated as in Fig. 3(b), the detector
is conﬁgured to detect horizontally-polarized radiation.

For the measurements described in the following sections, the array turntable was mounted on a scissor lift that
allowed the height of the center of the array above the runway to be varied between hA = 3.3 m and 5.0 m; for each
measurement, the heights hA and hD were measured to an accuracy of ±5 cm. An accurate measurement of hA and
hD is important because the intensity received at the detector results from interference between signals traveling along
a direct path between array and detector and reﬂections from the ground [14]. The situation is shown in Fig. 4(a).
This process is covered in detail in the Appendix.

The eﬀect of the interference on the signal received from a simple horizontally-polarized dipole aerial is shown in
Fig 4(b). Firstly, clear fringes are seen in the detected intensity as a function of distance. A second consequence of
the interference is less obvious. Fig. 4 shows received power in the logarithmic units Belm versus log10(distance); the
gradient of the plot should be −γ, where (received power) ∝ (distance)−γ. Naive expectations based on the emission
of a dipole surrounded by inﬁnite empty space lead one to predict γ = 2 (the inverse square law [15]); in practice,
the interference leads to γ ≈ 4 (see Fig. 4(b)). Such a dependence is familiar to radio engineers as the penultimate

term of the “Egli” relationship [21] describing the power lost for frequencies f in the hundreds of MHz range when
transmitting over a path close to the earth’s surface:

path loss (dB) = 113 + 20 log10 f + 40 log10(path length (miles)) − 20 log10(hAhD).

(4)

The eﬀects of interference obviously complicate the search for the non-spherical decay associated with the cusp (see
Section IV). One criterion used in the experiments was to look for signiﬁcantly smaller path losses than Egli (Eq. 4);
more detailed analysis was then used to model the detailed behavior of the data.

Reﬂections from the ground complicate also the modeling of the angular distribution of the emission from the array.
A detailed treatment of the coordinates needed for delineating the direct and reﬂected rays is given in the Appendix,
as are the equations from Refs. [12, 13] required for modeling the data.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE RADIATION

A.

Intensity as a function of ϑV at ﬁxed φV

The array was mounted in the conﬁguration shown in Fig. 3(a) and the detector antenna placed at a ﬁxed distance
R away; detector and array were ﬁxed at heights hD and hA respectively above the level runway. The angle φV was
set to a series of ﬁxed values with an accuracy of ±0.5◦ using a Suunto clinometer, and then the angle ϑV was varied
using the turntable. The measurement of ϑV was made to an accuracy of ±0.5◦ using a graticule on the turntable. At
each value of (ϑV, φV), the intensity of the signal at the detector antenna was measured using the spectrum analyser.
Fig. 5(a) shows the eﬀect of varying the source speed v = a∆ϕ/∆t on the intensity distribution as a function of ϑV.
Data for v/c = 1.064, 1.25 and 2.0 are shown; for each data set, η/2π = 552.654 MHz, Ω/2π = 46.042 MHz, and the
observation is made at the higher of the two emitted frequencies, f+ = |(Ω + mω)|/2π ≡ (Ω + η)/2π = 598.696 MHz.
As the source speed increases, the peak in detected power moves out to higher values of ϑV, in line with expectations;
the contributions that are received from diﬀerent source elements, by an observer in the far ﬁeld, are in phase when

FIG. 5: (a) The eﬀect of varying the source speed, v = a∆ϕ/∆t on the angular distribution of the radiation from the array.
For each data set, φV = 2◦ and the array to detector distance is R = 600 m. Data are points, identiﬁed as follows: ﬁlled circles:
v = 1.064c, hA = 3.7 m, hD = 4.1 m; crosses: v = 1.25c, hA = hD = 5.0 m; diamonds: v = 2.0c, hA = hD = 5.0 m. The curves
are ﬁts, using the model (Eq. 44) described in the Appendix. For each data set, η/2π = 552.654 MHz, Ω/2π = 46.042 MHz,
and the observation is made at the higher of the two emitted frequencies, f+ = |(Ω + mω)|/2π ≡ (Ω + η)/2π = 598.696 MHz.
Note that the peak emission moves out to higher values of ϑV as the source speed increases. (b) Power detected versus ϑV over
a wider angular range than (a); here, R = 400 m, hA = hD = 5.0 m, φV = 2◦ and the frequency is the same as in (a). The
points (hollow diamonds) are data; the model (using the experimental source speed) is the continuous curve.

Compared to the emission of a conventional antenna [25], the rather small side lobes are a further characteristic of the
beaming produced by an accelerated superluminal source. To show this more clearly, a single data set, corresponding
to v/c = 2.0, is shown in Fig. 5(b). Although the projection of the length of the array onto a plane normal to the
observation direction is comparable to or smaller than the radiation wavelength and the observation is made at many
hundreds of Fresnel distances, most of the power is transmitted in a beam around 20◦ wide, with small side lobes.
This beam structure is reproduced very well by the model (Appendix, Eq. 44), using the experimental source speed as
an input parameter. (In the case of the present emission mechanism, the side lobes are caused mainly by interference
from the ground; it follows from Eq. 44 that in free space they would be much weaker.)

Whilst Fig. 5 shows data for the emission at f+ = |(Ω + η)|/2π, the description of the source, Eq. 2, leads one
to expect simultaneous emission at a second frequency, f− = |(Ω − η)|/2π. As f+ and f− have diﬀerent harmonic
numbers, n, their angle of emission will diﬀer slightly (see Eq. 5 and Table I). This eﬀect is shown for source speeds
of v/c = 2.0 in Fig. 6(a) and v/c = 1.25 in Fig. 6(b). In each case, the emission at f+ is peaked at a higher value of
ϑV than that at f−, as predicted by Eq. 5 and the solid curves (see Appendix).

It has already been mentioned in the discussion of Fig. 5(a) that the beam is rather sharply deﬁned as a function
of ϑV, even though the projection of the length of the array on the plane perpendicular to the observation direction
is comparable to or smaller than the radiation wavelength. This characteristic is independent of distance over the
range measured, as shown in Fig. 7, which plots data (points) for 200 m ≤ R ≤ 900 m. For all of these R values,
each representing hundreds of Fresnel distances, the central part of the beam preserves its overall width and general
shape. This development of beam structure with R is reproduced by the theoretical description (Fig. 7, curves; see
Appendix, Eq. 44), using the experimental source speed as input parameter.

Note that all of the data sets plotted in this Section involve small values of φV(∼ 2◦). The reason for this constraint
is that as well as having a peaked structure as a function of the polar angle ϑV, the emission of the source is also
peaked in the plane of rotation (i.e. around φV = φH = 0), as expected in the theoretical description [12, 13]. This

Intensity as a function of φH at ﬁxed ϑH

The array was mounted in the conﬁguration shown in Fig. 3(b) and the detector was placed at a ﬁxed distance R
away; detector and array were ﬁxed at the respective heights of hD and hA above the level runway. The angle ϑH was
set to a series of ﬁxed values to an accuracy of ±0.5◦ using a Suunto clinometer, and then the angle φH was varied
using the turntable. The measurement of φH was carried out using a graticule on the turntable to an accuracy of
±0.5◦. At each value of (ϑH, φH) the intensity was recorded.

Fig. 8 shows the beam proﬁle as a function of φH for ϑH = 30◦, 35◦ and 40◦ and distances R = 200 m and 900 m.
Note that the peak emission is centered around φH = 0, as expected from theory [12]; variations of φH of around ±10◦
away from zero do not aﬀect the intensity much, but thereafter, the intensity falls away rapidly.

Taken in conjunction with Fig. 5, the data in Fig. 8 show that the emission from the superluminal source is tightly
beamed in both the azimuthal and polar directions. The observation of a peaked emitted power distribution (see
Fig. 6) at two frequencies shows that this eﬀect is frequency independent, depending instead on the speed of the
source and the geometry of the array. Once again we contrast this with the case of a conventional antenna [25]; the
beaming occurs even though the projection of the length of the array onto a plane normal to the observation direction
is comparable to or smaller than the radiation wavelength and the observation is made at many hundreds of Fresnel
distances.

Finally, we remark that the evolution of the beam proﬁle as ϑH and φH vary is in good agreement with the
expectations of theory [12]. Fig. 9 shows the the φH dependence of the detected power (linear scale) for several
values of ϑH. The evolution of the beamshape, including the development of a precursor (a side maximum), is well
reproduced by the model (Appendix, Eq. 44), using the experimental value of v/c.

IV. NONSPHERICALLY DECAYING COMPONENT OF THE RADIATION

A. General properties

The previous section has shown that the angular distribution of the emission from the experimental source is in good
quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for a rotating, oscillating superluminal source (see Appendix) [12,
13]. However, the most controversial aspect of the model of Refs. [6, 12, 13] has been the prediction of a component
of the emission that decays nonspherically, i.e. as 1/R, rather than 1/R2 [7, 8]. This component is due to an eﬀect,
only possible in the case of an accelerated superluminal source, whereby waves that were emitted over a ﬁnite interval
of emission time arrive at the detector during a much shorter interval of reception time. The constructive interference
of such superposed waves is strongest if their emission time interval is centered at the instant at which their source
approaches the detector (along the radiation direction) with the wave speed (the speed of light) and zero acceleration.
The locus of the series of points for which this occurs for a single volume element of the source constitutes the
propagating space curve which we have here called the cusp [6, 13].

In this section, we describe the location and the characteristic features of this emission for a source speed of
v = 1.064c and the frequency f+ = (Ω + η)/2π = 598.696 MHz; the theoretical predictions for this speed lead one to
expect that the cusp loci will be found close to ϑH = 20◦ at small values of φH: For a source that is centered at ϕ = 0
and an observation point that lies in the far ﬁeld, Eq. 49 of Ref. [13] reduces to ϕP ≃ −3π/2, θP ≃ arcsin[c/(rω)], in
which rω ≡ v.

As a reference point, Fig. 10(a) shows the detected power versus array-to-detector distance R, both plotted on
logarithmic scales, for the case of the source moving subluminally; the velocity is v/c = 0.875. Note that the data
(points) are very similar to those shown in Fig. 4 for the emission of a dipole aerial; indeed, the data are well ﬁtted
using the interference model for a point-like source and spherical decay described in the Appendix (curve), especially
at larger distances where the ﬁnite array size is much smaller than R. This suggests that the emission of the array
running subluminally is entirely “conventional”; the detected power obeys the inverse square law (once the eﬀects of
interference are taken into account), and at large distances the source appears point-like.

Figure 10(b) shows detected power versus log10(R) for the source running superluminally (v/c = 1.064), for array-
to-detector distances R measured along the expected direction of the cusp loci. The contrast with Fig. 10(a) is

the curve is the interference model described in the Appendix; the refractive index is N = 1.074. (b) Detected power versus
log10(R) for the superluminal source close to the expected cusp direction. The source velocity is v/c = 1.064, hA = hD = 5.0 m,
φH = −5◦, ϑH = 20◦, f+ = (η + Ω)/2π = 598.696 MHz. Data are points; the dotted curve is a ﬁt to Eq. 17 (Appendix). This
model is valid for larger R and assumes both no beaming and an intensity proportional to 1/R2κ
. Fit parameters are 2κ = 0.90
and N = 1.074. The solid curve represents a ﬁt to Eqs. 18 and 19 that uses a Gaussian beam of width 2w; ﬁt parameters are
2κ = 1.05, 2w = 4.18◦ and K = 16.6. (c) Detected power versus log10(R) to one side of the cusp direction; all experimental
details are the same as in (b) except φH = 0. Data are points, the dotted line is a ﬁt to Eq. 17 (2κ = 1.41, N = 1.074). The
solid curve is a ﬁt to Eqs 18 and 19 (2κ = 1.47, 2w = 6.69◦, K = 17.3). (d) Same as (c) but with φH = −10◦. Data are
points; the ﬁt to Eq. 17 is dotted (2κ = 1.47, N = 1.074). the solid curve is a ﬁt to Eqs 18 and 19 (2κ = 1.48, 2w = 6.56◦,
K = 14.6). (The data shown here are limited to R ≤ 600 m because the runway at the Turweston Aerodrome dips sharply in
its last 300 m.)

immediately visible, and involves three distinct diﬀerences:

1. The interference fringe visible at around log10(R) = 2 in (a) is absent in (b).

2. At larger distances, the detected power falls oﬀ with distance more slowly in (b) than in (a).

3. The data in (b) possess a much greater “scatter” than those in (a). This scatter occurs in spite of the fact that
the detected power is ∼ 50 dB above the noise ﬂoor; moreover, the scatter is to a large extent reproducible.

The last point can be understood by noting that the cusps represent emission by those volume elements of the source
that travel towards the detector at zero acceleration and the speed of light, volume elements that collectively function
as a coherent source [13]. The power emitted by a coherent source (such as a laser) normally contains reproducible
variations known as “speckle” [24]; the reproducible scatter seen in Fig. 10(b) is due to just such a phenomenon.

Turning to the other diﬀerences between Fig. 10(a) and (b), the absence of an interference fringe is expected
if the radiation along this direction is tightly beamed (the loci of the cusps are expected to have narrow angular
width [12, 13]), so that it is not reﬂected from the ground close to the array; a detailed treatment of this eﬀect is given
in the Appendix (Eqs. 18 and 19). The slower decrease in power with increasing distance is another consequence of
the properties of the cusps; we shall return to the exact exponent describing the decrease below.

As mentioned above, the cusps occupy only a small angular range; morover, they are expected to become narrower,
the further one goes from the source. Some idea of this eﬀect is gained by rotating the array by 5◦; whereas Fig. 10(b)
has φH = −5◦, Figs. 10(c) and (d) show similar data for φH = 0 and φH = −10◦ respectively. Note that the small shift
in direction has resulted in data that exhibit a smaller degree of “scatter” compared to those in Fig. 10(b) (especially
at larger R), and that the detected power falls oﬀ more rapidly with increasing distance in (c) and (d) than in (b).

FIG. 11: (a) and (b): Ratio P cusp/P sub (see Eq. 9) of the detected power with the source running superluminally (at v/c = 1.064)
to that with the source running subluminally (v/c = 0.875) versus R, measured on two separate occasions. Both data sets follow
paths close to the expected direction of the cusps; hA = hD = 5.0 m, φH = −5◦, ϑH = 20◦, f+ = (η + Ω)/2π = 598.696 MHz.
Data are points; the lines are ﬁts to Eq. 6 with µ ≈ 1. A linear ﬁt through the origin implies that the power in the superluminal
case would decline in free space as 1/R (see Eq. 9). (c) and (d) show similar plots just oﬀ the cusp direction; ϕH = 0 in (c),
and ϕH = −10◦ in (d). All other parameters are the same as in (a) and (b). The ﬁts (solid curves) are to Eq. 6 with µ = 0.62
in (c) and µ = 0.52 in (d); i.e. the power ratio increases more slowly with distance, and cannot be ﬁtted with a line through
the origin.

The ﬁrst observation is entirely expected; once one is oﬀ the cusp loci, the source no longer appears as coherent [13],
and so the “speckle” eﬀects should decrease. Along directions that appreciably diﬀer from that of the cusp loci, the
emitted power has the same dependence on distance as in Fig. 10(a), i.e. as in the case of a subluminal source or a
conventional dipole.

Having identiﬁed the distinct features of the non-spherically-decaying component of the radiation, we describe in
the following sections three experimental methods for determining the exponent 2κ that describes the rate at which
the intensity of this component decays with distance R (i.e. intensity ∝ 1/R2κ). In each case, we shall ﬁnd that
2κ ≈ 1, in agreement with theoretical expectations [6, 13].

B. Determination of the rate at which power falls oﬀ with distance using models of the interference

Comparison of Figs. 10(a)-(d) shows that the detected power decreases most slowly with increasing distance in
the case of superluminal velocities and measurements along the cusp direction (Fig. 10(b)). However, obtaining
the exponent 2κ for this decrease is complicated by the eﬀects of interference from the ground; we have already
seen that even the emission of a simple dipole does not decrease as 1/R2 (Fig. 4(b)) in proximity to the ground.
The part of the radiation corresponding to the cusps provides a further complication in that it is expected to be
tightly beamed [6, 13]; the current experimental machine agrees with these predictions in that the beam width of
of the non-spherically-decaying component is appreciably (by an order of magnitude or more) narrower than the
beams observed in the spherically-decaying part of the radiation (as shown in Figs. 5-9). A narrow beam will not be
appreciably reﬂected from the ground when the detector is close to the array; hence, features due to interference will
be suppressed.

Two treatments for this problem are included in the Appendix (Eqs. 17 to 19). If the beam has an angular spread
2w, then at distances R >
∼ hA/w, a substantial proportion of the beam will be reﬂected from the ground; therefore
a relatively simple treatment of interference (Eq. 17) can be used. The only input parameters are the power law
of the decay of the radiation with distance (intensity ∝ 1/R2κ) and N , the refractive index of the ground (already

constrained to be N = 1.074 by ﬁtting the interference fringes of the subluminal emission–see Fig. 10(a)). This
method (Fig. 10(b), dotted curve) yields a value 2κ = 0.90, i.e., an intensity proportional to 1/R0.90.

For smaller values of R, a more sophisticated ﬁtting method (Appendix; Eqs. 18, 19) takes account of the beaming
by using a Gaussian beam of angular width 2w, and also allowing for the presence of residual spherically-decaying
waves close to the array. This function is shown as a solid curve in Fig. 10(b); the ﬁt parameters are 2κ = 1.05,
2w = 4.18◦ and K = 16.6 (see Eq. 19). This implies that the non-spherically-decaying part of the radiation has an
intensity that decays as 1/R1.05 and that it is conﬁned to an angular width ∼ 4◦. The fact that K, which depends
on the geometry and perfection of the source, is substantially larger than 1 implies that the dominant emission from
the experimental machine is spherically-decaying, with a small component of non-spherically-decaying emission.

The narrow angular width of the non-spherically-decaying part of the radiation is emphasised by Figs. 10(c) and
(d), which show the detected power versus distance for φH = 0 and φH = −10◦ (rather than the φH = −5◦ used in
Fig 10(b)). The power falls oﬀ more quickly at large distances in (c) and (d) than in (b), and this is reﬂected in
the ﬁts. For example, in (c), the simple model (dotted curve; Eq. 17) yields 2κ = 1.41 (with N constrained to be
1.074 to match the ﬁt in Fig. 10(a)), whereas the more sophisticated Eqs. 18 and 19 (solid curve) give 2κ = 1.47,
2w = 6.69◦ and K = 17.3. Both ﬁts suggest an intensity that is approximately ∝ 1/R1.5 and the latter is suggestive
of less beaming of the radiation. Similar considerations apply to the ﬁts to the data in Fig. 10(d).

C. Determination of the rate at which power falls oﬀ with distance using intensity ratios

An alternative, model independent way of determining the exponent 2κ is to divide the power detected along the
cusp by that detected when the source is run subluminally under similar conditions. Such a comparison can only
be made beyond the region containing the interference fringes (i.e. R > 150 m), because (as mentioned above) the
cusp has a distinctly “beamed” character, whereas the radiation from the subluminal source is much more isotropic.
This comparison is shown in Figs. 11(a) and (b) for data taken on two separate occasions with diﬀering weather
conditions. Each data set represents the detected power P cusp along the expected cusp direction with the source
running superluminally (v/c = 1.064), divided by the detected power P sub with the source running subluminally
(v/c = 0.875). In both subluminal and superluminal runs, all other experimental parameters were identical.

The data were ﬁtted to a function

P cusp
P sub = CRµ
where µ and C are ﬁt parameters. The ﬁts yielded µ ≈ 1, i.e. a straight line through the origin, implying that
the power ratio is roughly proportional to R (Figs. 11(a), (b)). This result can be explained as follows. Once the
interference fringes have been passed, P sub will obey an approximate relationship

(6)

where Csub is a constant or a very slowly-varying function of R. There are many precedents for the use of such power
laws in the empirical functions [14, 21, 22] for describing radio transmission (e.g. Eq. 4). The straight lines through
the origin seen in Figs. 11(a),(b) will only occur if the power P cusp follows the relationship

so that

This again suggests that the power in the non-spherically-decaying component of the radiation would decay in free
space more slowly with distance R than 1/R2.

Once again, the narrowness of the region occupied by the cusps can be demonstrated by shifting φH by only 5◦
(Figs. 11(c),(d)). The power ratio increases more slowly with distance, and the data can no longer be ﬁtted by a
straight line through the origin; instead µ = 0.62 in (c) and 0.52 in (d) (see Eq. 6).

The various methods of characterizing the rate at which the detected power falls oﬀ with R shown in Figs. 10 and
11 suggest that the intensity of the non-spherically-decaying component is roughly proportional to 1/R, in agreement

15

with theoretical predictions [6, 13]. Moreover, the relatively small angular range over which this 1/R dependence is
observed (compare Figs. 10(b) and (c)) emphasises the narrowness of the region occupied by the cusps.

Note that in the present experiments, the Fresnel distance (Rayleigh range) is of the order of a few meters. The
maximum length of the array that can be projected onto a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction is
l = 1.74 m and the shortest wavelength used is λ = 0.50 m. These together yield a maximum Fresnel distance
RF = l2/λ = 6.0 m. There is no parameter other than the Fresnel distance to limit the range of validity of the above
results, and these, as we have seen, have been tested for R ≫ RF.

V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have constructed and tested an experimental implementation of an oscillating, superluminal po-
larization current distribution that undergoes centripetal acceleration. Theoretical treatments [12, 13] lead one to
expect that the radiation emitted from each volume element of such a polarization current will comprise a ˇCerenkov-
like envelope with two sheets that meet along a cusp. The emission from the experimental machine has been found to
be in good agreement with these expectations, the combined eﬀect of the volume elements leading to tightly-deﬁned
beams of a well-deﬁned geometry, determined by the source speed and trajectory. In addition, over a restricted range
of angles, we detect the presence of cusps in the emitted radiation. These are due to the detection over a short time
period (in the laboratory frame) of radiation emitted over a considerably longer period of source time. Consequently,
the intensity of the radiation at these angles was observed to decline more slowly with increasing distance from the
source than would the emission from a conventional antenna. The angular distribution of the emitted radiation and
the properties associated with the cusp are in good quantitative agreement with theoretical models of superluminal
sources once the eﬀect of reﬂections from the earth’s surface are taken into account. In particular, the prediction that
the beaming and the slow decay should extend into the far-zone has been tested to several hundred Fresnel distances.
The above results have implications not only for the interpretation of observational data on pulsars, which originally
motivated the theoretical investigation of the present emission process [6, 10], but also for a diverse set of disciplines
and technologies in which these ﬁndings have potential practical applications [26]. One such technology is long-range
and high-bandwidth telecommunications.

Since all of the processes involved in generating the polarization current distribution are linear, and the direction
of the emitted “beam” only depends on the source speed, it should be simple to use an array to broadcast several
beams in diﬀerent directions simultaneously. This could be achieved by applying voltages which are sums of terms
like Eq. 3, each with a diﬀerent speed, to the electrodes of an array. The beaming is frequency independent, and so an
array could potentially be used to transmit multiple directed beams at several frequencies. (The very small side lobes,
especially in free space, are a further characteristic of the beaming produced by the present emission mechanism that
facilitates this type of transmission.)

Of particular practical signiﬁcance are the properties of the non-spherically-decaying component of the radiation
that we have observed: the fact that its intensity decays like 1/R, rather than 1/R2, with the distance R from its
source, and that its beam-width is less than ∼ 5◦ at ∼ 500 m. This radiation mechanism could thus be used, in
principle, to convey electronic data over very long distances with very much lower attenuation than is possible with
existing sources. In the case of ground-to-satellite communications, for example, the above properties imply that
either far fewer satellites would be required for the same bandwidth or each satellite could handle a much wider range
of signals for the same power output.

The excellent correspondence between the experimental data and theoretical predictions supports the proposal that
polarization current distributions act as superluminal sources of radiation, and that they can be used for studying
and utilizing the novel eﬀects associated with superluminal electrodynamics. The apparatus described in this paper
represents just one possible geometry and excitation scheme. In principle, a whole class of superluminal sources are
possible, corresponding, for example, to a rectilinearly accelerated polarization current [6] (rather than a centripetally
accelerated one), or to a medium that is polarized by impinging laser beams (rather than by applied voltages), and
so on. It is hoped that the publication of this paper will stimulate further work along these lines.

VII. APPENDIX: PROCEDURES USED IN MODELING AND FITTING THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Introduction

This Appendix contains the procedures used to model and ﬁt the experimental data. It is necessary to be rather
rigorous in treating the radiation from a superluminal source and the eﬀects of interference from the ground, and so
we have described the mathematical techniques in some detail, a level of detail that would impede the discussion of
the experimental data if it were included in the main body of the paper. Moreover, some eﬀects described in the
Appendix, such as interference caused by reﬂections from the ground, feature in the interpretation in all sections of
the paper. It is therefore logical to collect all of the discussions of these phenomena in one place.

The Appendix is divided into two main sections, treatment of interference due to reﬂections from the ground (see
Fig. 4), and use of the theory contained in Refs. [12, 13] to model the emissions of the experimental array (and in
particular the beaming of the radiation). Finally a shorter section deals with the robustness of the (small number of)
ﬁtting parameters used to model the data.

Interference caused by reﬂections from the ground

It is well known from the telecommunications literature [14, 17, 21, 22] that interference is a signiﬁcant complication
in the propagation of radio waves close to the ground; the detected signal is the result of the interference between
the direct and the reﬂected waves, i.e. between the waves that propagate directly from the source to the detector
and the waves that reach the director after reﬂection from the ground. In the current experiments, this eﬀect has
been characterized by observing the emission from both a small dipole aerial and the array of the source driven at a
subluminal velocity.

Simple treatment of the eﬀects of interference on the radiation of a dipole aerial

We treat the dipole aerial as a point source at x = 0, y = 0, z = hA emitting radiation of wavenumber k in the
presence of a medium, index of refraction N , occupying z ≤ 0. The detector is assumed to be at the height hD and a
distance R away from the source (see Fig. 4(a)).

Had it not been deﬂected by the ground, the reﬂected ray that passes through the observation point P would have
passed through the mirror image P′ of P with respect to the ground. Thus the angle α that the reﬂected ray makes
with the normal to the ground ˆeg, and the distance Rr that the reﬂected wave traverses to reach the detector are
respectively given by

α = arctan{[R2 − (hD − hA)2]

2 /(hD + hA)},

1

(see Fig. 4(a)). When R is large enough for the curvature of the wave fronts to be negligible, the reﬂected and the
incident waves are related via the Fresnel coeﬃcients:

are the Fresnel coeﬃcients for Eincident perpendicular or Eincident parallel to the plane of incidence, respectively;
the magnetic permeability of the ground is here set equal to unity. (Note that the index of refraction N and so
the coeﬃcients q⊥ and qk are in general complex. However, for waves of frequency f , the imaginary parts of these
quantities are negligible when 2σ/(ǫf ) ≪ 1, where σ and ǫ are the conductivity and the dielectric constant of the
reﬂecting medium, respectively [17]. The latter condition appears to encompass all of the experiments described in
this paper.)

Hence, in the case of the spherically-decaying radiation that is generated by a point-like aerial in the vicinity of the

ground, the observed power at the detector is given, to within a constant of proportionality, by

⊥ as a function of the distance R and ﬁtting the
resulting data to the above equation, it is possible to determine N for the ground (i.e. the airﬁeld runway) under a
particular set of weather conditions (see Fig. 4(b)). This is then used in Eqs. 17 and 19 (see below) to model the
emission of the superluminal source.

The eﬀects of interference on the non-spherically-decaying component of the radiation from a super-
luminal source

The radiation by a superluminal source consists of two components: a spherically-decaying component whose intensity
has the dependence R−2 on R (as does any other radiation) and a nonspherically-decaying component. To treat the
latter component in the presence of reﬂection from the ground, we rewrite Eq. 16 as follows:

.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

In other words, the exponent κ, describing the rate at which the amplitude of each component (direct and reﬂected)
diminishes with increasing R, has become an adjustable parameter. The theoretically predicted value of κ for a
centripetally accelerated superluminal source is 1

2 (see [6, 13]).

Eq. 17 will only be valid if the amplitudes of the radiation traveling via the direct and reﬂected paths are similar.
However, in the present experiment, the beam-width of the nonspherically-decaying component is appreciably (by a
factor of 10 or more) smaller than that of the spherically-decaying component. This results in a substantial diﬀerence
between the amplitudes of the direct and reﬂected rays when the detector is close to the source. (It is this phenomenon
that is responsible for suppressing the interference fringes in Figs. 10(b), (c) and (d).) Unless R is large, therefore,
the Fresnel coeﬃcients in the above expression should be modiﬁed to take account of beaming. When modeling the
data for ranges R >

∼ 150 m, we have consequently replaced the coeﬃcients qk,⊥ by

Qk,⊥ = qk,⊥ exp[−( 1

2 π − α)2/w2],

(18)

where α is the angle between an incident ray and the normal to the reﬂecting surface (see Fig. 12) and w represents
the Gaussian half-width of the beam. The exponential factor multiplying the Fresnel coeﬃcients greatly reduces the
amplitudes of the reﬂected waves for which α diﬀers from π/2 by more than w.

As R tends to a value much larger than c/ω along this narrow beam, the nonspherically-decaying component of the
radiation dominates over the conventional component. At shorter distances from the source, however, the detected
power receives contributions from both of these components. If the ﬁtting includes data for relatively small values of
R (see e.g. the solid curves in Figs. 10(b) and (c)), both spherically- and non-spherically-decaying contributions must
be combined as follows:

Here, the constant K stands for the relative strengths of the sources of the two components, and π/4 is the phase
diﬀerence betweem them (see [12, 13]).

Extension to a volume source: description of the direct and reﬂected rays in terms of the experimentally
measured coordinates

The modeling of the data is based on the same coordinates as those used in the theory papers [12, 13], shown in
Fig. 3(c,d). In these coordinates, the source consists of the arc −π/36 < ϕ < π/36 of a circular strip, centered on
the origin, with the radius a = 10.025 m and the thickness ∆r = 0.05 m. The source velocity points in the direction
of increasing ϕ (see Fig. 3(d); its angular velocity points in the direction of positive z). Since the position of the
source in Fig. 3(a) is such that its velocity points from the left to the right, the spherical coordinates (RP , θP , ϕP )
of Refs. [12, 13] have to be based, in the present case, on a Cartesian system whose z-axis points downward, as in
Fig. 3(c). (The midpoint of the source arc lies on the x-axis of this underlying Cartesian system; see Fig. 3(c).)

For comparing the data with the theoretical predictions, we need to express (RP, θP, ϕP) in terms of the experi-

mentally measured coordinates (R, ϑV, φV) and (R, ϑH, φH) of Figs. 3(a) and 3(b).

The Cartesian system (x′, y′, z′) corresponding to the spherical coordinates (R, ϑV , φV ) of Fig. 3(a) diﬀers from
the Cartesian system (x, y, z) corresponding to the spherical coordinates (RP, θP, ϕP) of Fig. 3(c) in that its origin is
shifted by the array radius a along the positive x-axis, its x and y axes are interchanged, and its z-axis is inverted:

x′ = y,

y′ = x − a,

z′ = −z.

The Cartesian and polar coordinates of the observation point P in the reference frame shown in Fig. 3(a) are related
by

x′ = R cos ϑV cos φV,

y′ = R cos ϑV sin φV,

z′ = R sin ϑ.

These, together with the corresponding coordinates of P in the reference frame shown in Figs. 3(c), (d),

x = RP sin θP cos ϕP,

y = RP sin θP sin ϕP,

z = R cos θP,

yield the ﬁrst required transformation:

RP = (R2 + a2 + 2aR cos ϑV sin φV)1/2,

In Fig. 3(b), the position vector of the observation point P is projected onto the (x′, z′) plane of the shifted Cartesian

system (x′, y′, z′), so that

x′ = R cos φH cos ϑH,

y′ = R sin φH,

z′ = R cos φH sin ϑH.

Having expressed the position vector xP = (RP, θP, ϕP) of the detector in terms of the experimentally measured
coordinates, we now know how to determine the characteristics of the direct ray xP − x that links each source element
x = (r, ϕ, z) of the array to the observation point P. The next step is to determine the corresponding characteristics of
the reﬂected rays that reach P from various volume elements of the array. As we have already seen in the treatment
of a simple dipole aerial, both the angle α that a given reﬂected ray makes with the normal to the ground, ˆeg, and
the distance Rr that this wave traverses to reach the detector at P (see Fig. 12) can be easily inferred from the
position vector xP′ of the image P′ of P with respect to the ground. We proceed to determine xP′ in terms both of
the coordinates (R, ϑV , φV ) and of the coordinates (R, ϑH , φH ).

Suppose that the plane of the array is vertical, as in Fig. 3(a), and that the upward-pointing normal to the ground
at the point of reﬂection, ˆeg, makes the angle φ0 with the positive x-axis of the (x, y, z) frame (whose z-axis is in this
case parallel to the ground), i.e.

(For a smooth and perfectly horizontal ground, φ0 is related to φV via φ0 − φV = arcsin[(hA − hD)/R].) Then the
position vector, in the (x, y, z) frame, of the image P′ of P across the earth’s surface can be written as

ˆeg = cos φ0ˆex − sin φ0ˆey.

xP′ = R + aˆex − 2hDˆeg,

where R is the position vector of P in the (x′, y′, z′) frame, the frame whose origin lies at the midpoint of the array
(see Figs. 3(c) and 12).

The following expressions for xP′ and R in terms of their components in the (x, y, z) and the (x′, y′, z′) frames,

xP′ = RP′ sin θP′(cos ϕP′ ˆex + sin ϕP′ ˆey) + RP′ cos θP′ ˆez,

R = R cos ϑV(cos φVˆex′ + sin φVˆey′) + R sin ϑVˆez′ ,

together with the relationships

between the base vectors of these two frames (see Eq. 20) therefore yield

ˆex′ = ˆey,

ˆey′ = ˆex,

ˆez′ = −ˆez

RP′ = [R2 + a2 + (2hD)2 − 4ahD cos φ0 + 2aR cos ϑV sin φV − 4hDR cos ϑV sin(φV − φ0)]1/2,

To determine xP′ in terms of the coordinates (R, ϑH , φH ) of Fig. 3(b), suppose that the upward-pointing normal to
the ground, at the point of reﬂection, makes the angle ϑ0 with the negative z-axis of the (x, y, z) frame (whose x-axis
is in this case parallel to the ground), i.e.

ˆeg = − sin ϑ0ˆey − cos ϑ0ˆez.

Theoretical treatment of the spherically-decaying component of the emission from the experimental array

We now describe the use of the theory of Refs. [12, 13] to model the emissions of the experimental array. Our
purpose is to predict the beaming of the spherically-decaying component of the radiation; relevant data are shown in
Figs. 5-9. (The detailed behavior of the nonspherically-decaying component will be left for a future work.) The same
mathematical notation as that in Refs. [12, 13] is used; for consistency with the original papers, we employ Gaussian
electromagnetic units.

We commence with the following far-ﬁeld expressions for the electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B in the absence of

boundaries [Eqn. (14) of Ref. [12]]:

Here tP is the time at which the ﬁeld is measured at the observation point P, and x and t are the position of a
source element and the retarded time, respectively; ˆn = xP/|xP| is a unit vector along the direction linking the source
that is localized in the vicinity of the origin and the observer at P. For the polarization P described in Eq. 2, whose
distribution pattern both rotates (with an angular frequency ω) and oscillates (with a frequency Ω), the source term
in the above expression is related to the cylindrical components (sr, sϕ, sz) of the vector s that designates the direction
of the current density j = ∂P/∂t by

where the cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z) and (rP, ϕP, zP) of x and xP are with respect to the (x, y, z) frame shown
in Fig. 3(c), ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt, µ± ≡ (Ω/ω) ± m, ˆek = ˆeϕP (which is parallel to the plane of rotation) and ˆe⊥ = ˆn × ˆek are
a pair of unit vectors normal to the radiation direction ˆn, and the symbol {m → −m, Ω → −Ω} designates a term
exactly like the one preceding it but in which m and Ω are everywhere replaced by −m and −Ω, respectively. This is
Eq. (18) of Ref. [12].

We are interested in the context of the present measurements in the radiation that is polarized parallel to the plane
of the array; note also that the component sϕ is zero in the experimental array described in the current paper. Hence,
the relevant component of the source term in Eq. 36 is

integration in Eq. 35 consists, in the present case, of the cylindrical strip −5◦ < ϕ < 5◦, 10.00 m< r < 10.05 m,
−0.005 m < z < 0.005 m, that bounds the volume occupied by the array (see Fig. 1). Since the r and z dimensions
of this volume are appreciably shorter than the wavelengths at which the radiation is generated and measured in

,

(37)

the present experiments (0.50 m and 0.59 m), the integration with respect to these two coordinates may be omitted
when evaluating the integral in Eq. 35 without introducing any signiﬁcant error. (It must be emphasized that this
approximation may only be used in the case of the spherically-decaying component of the emission; it is necessary
to include the full volume of the source when calculating the nonspherically-decaying component. For the current
purposes–modeling the spherically-decaying data of Figs. 5-9–the approximation is adequate.)

Inserting Eq. 37 in Eq. 35 and performing the trivial integration with respect to t, we ﬁnd that the electric ﬁeld of
the radiation that is detected at either the frequency f+ = Ω + mω ≡ n+ω or the frequency f− = |Ω − mω| ≡ |n−|ω

if E(f±) is parallel to the plane of incidence, where ˆeg is the upward-pointing unit vector perpendicular to the ground
(see Eqs. 12 and 13). The coordinates (RP′ , θP′, ϕP′) have the values derived in Eq. 31 when the array is positioned
as in Fig. 3(a), and those derived in Eq. 34 when the array is positioned as in Fig. 3(b). The values of qk and q⊥
appear in Eqs. 14 and 15.

Next, we need to ﬁnd the power that is received at P by an observer whose detector only picks up radiation of a
given polarization, e.g. a polarization along the unit vector ˆp. This can be done by adding the components ˆp · E(f±)
and ˆp·Er(f±) of the electric-ﬁeld vectors of the direct and the reﬂected waves and averaging the square of the resulting
expression over the observation time tP. The result is

a general result that applies to both frequencies, irrespective of whether the radiation is polarized parallel or perpen-
dicular to the plane of incidence.

When the array is positioned as in Fig. 3(b), the generated radiation is polarized horizontally, i.e. in a direction
normal to the plane of incidence. In this case, ˆp· ˆeϕP and ˆp· ˆerw in the above equation are equal and so can be factored
out and absorbed in the constant of proportionality. But when the plane of the array is vertical, as in Fig. 3(a), the
electric-ﬁeld vectors of the generated and reﬂected waves, though both in the plane of incidence, are no longer parallel
to each other. In such experiments, we have used a receiving antenna whose polarization is vertical, i.e. for which

ˆp = ˆeg. According to Eqs. 26 and 43, therefore, the factors in question have the values ˆp · ˆeϕP = − sin(ϕP + φ0) and
ˆp · ˆerw = − sin(ϕP′ + φ0) in these experiments.

Note that the emission is beamed when the phase of the rapidly oscillating exponential in the integrand of Eq. 38

has a stationary point within the domain of integration, i.e. when

vanishes for a value of ϕ in −π/36 < ϕ < π/36. This stationary point would be degenerate, and so the beaming
would be tighter, if

vanishes at the same time. The above two conditions are satisﬁed simultaneously when

and so the phase in question is stationary at ϕ = ϕP + 2π − arccos[m2/(n±
2ˆrˆrP)] (cf. [12, 13]). The parameters in
our experiments are chosen such that the value of r implied by Eq. 47, for an observer in the far ﬁeld, lies within the
radial thickness 10.00 m < r < 10.05 m of the array.

Adjustable parameters: eﬀects of the array orientation and surface corrugations on the modeling of the
beaming data

There are no truly adjustable parameters in the analysis of the beaming data (Figs. 5-9) in this paper, especially
when R >
∼ 300 m. The speed of the source is constrained by the setting of the experimental machine and the refractive
index of the ground is determined by anciliary experiments with the dipole aerial (see Fig. 4). The measured heights
hA and hD and distance R are also used as input parameters. The remaining uncertainties come from the diﬃculties
involved with modeling the reﬂection of curved wave fronts and small inaccuracies in the angular coordinates. We
treat the latter ﬁrst.

In modeling the experimental data of Figs. 5-9, variations in the parameters ϑ0 (see Eq. 32) and φ0 (see Eq. 26),
the angles marking the orientation of the array, have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the relative phases of the rays traveling
on the direct and reﬂected paths (Fig. 12). Ideally, with ﬂat ground (i.e. the runway) and precision measurements of
the orientation of the array, these angles would be completely constrained by the measured experimental coordinates
φV and ϑH respectively, plus the known hA, hD and R. However, there are two problems with this approach:

1. The measurement of the angular coordinate desribing the tilting of the array is subject to relatively large

fractional errors, ∼ ±0.5◦;

2. The runway surface used for the measurement has distinct corrugations corresponding to fractions of a degree;

over long distances, these can result in non-negligible shifts in the apparent position of the reﬂected ray.

These uncertainties were encompassed by making ϑ0 or φ0 (as appropriate) somewhat adjustable; adjustments of less
than ∼ 1◦ from the expected value (i.e. of the order of the uncertainty in the experimental angles) were in general
suﬃcient to obtain very close agreement between model and data.

A second cause of uncertainty is the use of Fresnel coeﬃcients in dealing with reﬂection from the ground; Fresnel
coeﬃcients are of course derived for plane wave fronts [15]. As is well known in the modeling of radar beams [17],
wave fronts close to a source have signiﬁcant curvature, leading to an apparent loss of the reﬂected radiation due to
“phase smearing”. In the present case, the eﬀect becomes noticeable for R <

∼ 300 m.

A detailed treatment of curved wave fronts is very complex, and beyond the scope of this paper. However, a number
of empirical approximations may be used [17]. Following these precedents, the reﬂection coeﬃcient in simulations of
the beaming involving distances R <
∼ 300 m was scaled by a factor q0, representing the loss of signal on reﬂection due
to the curved wave fronts.

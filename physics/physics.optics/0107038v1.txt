faster than the decay time

The dynamical response of an optical Fabry-Perot cavity is investigated experimentally. We
observe oscillations in the transmitted and reﬂected light intensity if the frequency of the incoupled
light ﬁeld is rapidly changed. In addition, the decay of a cavity-stored light ﬁeld is accelerated if
the phase and intensity of the incoupled light are switched in an appropriate way. The theoretical
model by M. J. Lawrence et al, JOSA B 16, 523 (1999) agrees with our observations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Optical Fabry-Perot cavities are common in laser spec-
troscopy and interferometry and are frequently used for
the stabilization of laser sources [1,2]. A novel applica-
tion for high-ﬁnesse cavities was proposed in the early
90’s in the upcoming ﬁeld of cavity-QED: Single atoms
are strongly coupled to a cavity-stored photon ﬁeld such
that the mutual coherent oscillatory exchange between
both sub-systems is much faster than their individual de-
cay rates. A number of experiments, in both the optical
[3] and in the microwave regime [4], have shown that this
cavity-atom coupling can indeed be used for quantum in-
formation processing [5], where single quantum systems
such as atoms or photons carry qubits (as the quantum
alternative for the well known bits in information sci-
ence).

We are interested in the physics of Fabry-Perot cav-
ities because they can be used as an interface between
static quantum information storage, which is advanta-
geously done in long lived states of trapped atoms, and
the transport of quantum information by light [6]. For
this we are currently investigating the physical system
composed of a single trapped 40Ca+ ion inside the waist
of a high ﬁnesse cavity [7].

A second major motivation is the use of light forces on
atoms in cavities which leads to trapping and cooling, as
published recently [8,9]. Here, light ﬁelds at the single
photon level lead to signiﬁcant forces due to the large
enhancement factor of a high ﬁnesse cavity. The next
generation of experiments will detect the atom’s position
[10] and even modify the light ﬁeld in order to stabilize
the atom’s trajectory. This, however, not only demands
a fast detection method, but also a technique to rapidly
alter the photon ﬁeld inside the optical Fabry-Perot cav-
ity.

In this paper we show how the input light can be mod-
ulated to observe enforced evacuation of a cavity-stored
light ﬁeld, within a timescale below the cavity damping
time. For this, the phase and intensity of the incoupled
light ﬁeld are switched rapidly such that destructive in-
terference nulls the cavity-stored ﬁeld. This technique is

obviously interesting for application in the above exper-
iments.

The dynamic response of a Fabry-Perot cabity has
been investigated in the context of the Laser Interfer-
ometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) by M.
J. Lawrence et al. [11].
In that publication the trans-
mitted light intensity and the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)
error signal in reﬂection [12] are studied when the cavity
length or the frequency of the input light ﬁeld is rapidly
changed. The results which we present here complete and
generalize those earlier studies since we show how the full
control of frequency, phase, intensity and time duration
of an input light ﬁeld leads to a much larger variety of
interference eﬀects between cavity-stored light and input
ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows: After describing the
experimental setup, we ﬁrst study the response of the
transmitted and reﬂected light when the input ﬁeld fre-
quency is swept continuously over the cavity resonance.
Our results fully recover and conﬁrm the ﬁndings of M. J.
Lawrence et al. [11]. In the following parts we describe
more sophisticated implementations of modulating the
input, such as frequency switching (covered by section
3) and phase switching (section 4). In the ﬁnal section
we present the unusual response of the cavity ﬁeld to si-
multaneous phase and intensity switching, whereby the
decay of the cavity ﬁeld, as measured in the transmitted
light, is accelerated much below the cavity decay time.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A Titanium-Sapphire laser delivers up to 500 mW of
light at 729 nm wavelength. One part of the laser power
is focused into a Paul trap and used to excite the nar-
D5/2 transition of single trapped 40Ca+ ions
row S1/2 ↔
[13]. A second part is used to generate a PDH error sig-
nal from the reﬂection of a reference cavity with ﬁnesse
220000 (mirrors optically contacted to a 20 cm long ULE-
spacer). The Titanium-Sapphire laser frequency is sta-
bilized to this reference cavity and we measure a laser

1

linewidth of less than 100 Hz (using the narrow Ca+
transition) [14].

A third fraction of the light is coupled into an opti-
cal ﬁber which transports it from the optical table to a
vibration isolated platform. The experimental setup on
that platform is depicted in Fig. 1. The light from the
ﬁber output is sent through an acousto-optic modulator
(AOM: Brimrose Inc. USA, GRP-650) in double-pass
such that the light in the ﬁrst order beam is frequency
shifted by twice the AOM driving frequency (which can
be varied from 550 to 750 MHz). After passing through
an electro-optical modulator (EOM: Linos Inc. Ger-
many, LM0202) to add sidebands at 17 MHz to the
light, the light is mode-matched into a second high ﬁ-
nesse Fabry-Perot cavity. This cavity consists of a ULE-
spacer of 15 cm length with a central bore and two high
reﬂecting mirrors (Research Electro-Optics Inc. USA)
optically contacted onto the polished front faces of the
spacer. The cavity rests on 4 pins inside a UHV-vessel at
10−8 mbar. The UHV-vessel is temperature stabilized
≤
0.05 C. Light transmitted by the cavity is mon-
to 25
itored on a photo-diode PD 1 (bandwidth
0.1 MHz)
and a CCD-camera. The reﬂected intensity is detected
100 MHz), which
by a photo-diode PD 2 (bandwidth
is used for the generation of a PDH error signal.

An RF-synthesizer provides the driving frequency for
the AOM. The light frequency is varied over the TEM00
resonance of the cavity. A second synthesizer of the same
type and synchronized to the same timebase can be set
to a well-deﬁned frequency and phase oﬀset relative to
the ﬁrst one. An RF-switch (Minicircuits ZYSWA-2-50,
switching time 3 ns) is used to switch rapidly between
the ﬁrst and the second RF-synthesizer, in order to gen-
erate controlled frequency, intensity or phase jumps of
the input light.

FIG. 2. a) Decay of a stored cavity ﬁeld as monitored in
transmission (solid line). b) The cavity is ﬁlled with a reso-
nant light ﬁeld. We observe accelerated cavity decay (broken
line) monitored in transmission, when the phase of the input
light ﬁeld is switched by 180 degree (near t= 50 µs). Finally,
the input light is switched oﬀ (near t= 100 µs). The ratio of
both measured decay constants of 1.95(0.05) agrees with the
expected factor two.

First, we measured the cavity decay time: The RF-
drive of the AOM is switched oﬀ when the cavity trans-
mission is near a maximum (TEM00 resonance) and the
exponential decay of the cavity-stored light ﬁeld is ob-
served with PD 1 and an oscilloscope, see Fig. 2 a.
We ﬁnd an exponential decay with a time constant of
τs=37.1(0.3) µs. The ﬁnesse F of the cavity is related to
decay time τs = F L/cπ, which allows us to determine F
to be 233000

2000.

III. INPUT LIGHT FREQUENCY MODULATION

Consider a linear sweep of the input light frequency
and a standing wave cavity of ﬁxed length L. Initially
at t = 0, the input ﬁeld with constant amplitude E0
is at frequency ω0, and before the ﬁrst round-trip the
cav = i√T E0e−iω0t. Here,
intra-cavity ﬁeld reads E(0)
T denotes the transmission of the input coupling mir-
ror. After one round-trip, the cavity ﬁeld is slightly at-
tenuated, which the round-trip loss ρ = 1
π/F ac-
counts for, and interferes with the transmitted input
ﬁeld, which is now at diﬀerent frequency ωτ . We ob-
cav = ρe−iω0(t−τ ) + i√T E0e−iωτ τ e−iωτ (t−τ )). For
tain E(1)
n round-trips, a recursion equation is found [11] for E(n)
cav,
which ﬁnally leads to the diﬀerential equation

with ˜t = t/τs, the cavity decay time τs deﬁned as above,
and νω = 2F L ˙ωτ /πc which denotes the normalized scan

sion signal and the PDH error signals exhibit oscillations,

which appear for νω ≥

1.

FIG. 3. a) Simulation of the cavity intensity transmission, when the input frequency is varied over the resonance. We plot
|Ecav|2 of Eq.1. For this picture, the scan rate νω is chosen 0.1 for the lowest trace and increased by 133% each step in 20
steps, as indicated at the right hand side of the plot (for clarity, the curves are shifted upwards with increasing νω)). As the
calculation shows, for high νω, the point of highest transmission is shifted towards higher optical frequency detuning and the
transmission level is lowered. b) Simulated PDH error signal, Re(Ecav), Eq. 8 in reference [11] for diﬀerent values of νω.

FIG. 4. Cavity transmission as measured (solid line) and

calculated (broken) for νω = 1.35.

FIG. 5. PDH error signal as measured for diﬀerent νω of
0.01, and 1.35 (experiment: solid line, simulation: dotted
line).

Fig. 3 shows a numeric solution of Eq. 1, for diﬀerent
νω. For the simulation, we take the values which are re-
alized in the experiment for a standing wave cavity with
F =233000 and length of L=0.15 m. The frequency axis
is calculated using the transformation from time steps
of τs, as used for the evaluation of the diﬀerential equa-
tion, to the frequency detuning in Hz, by multiplying τs
c/(4F L). The experimental result for a cav-
with νω ·
ity transmission signal is shown in Fig. 4, together with
the simulation. The frequency scan rate was ˙ω = 2π
64 MHz/s which results in a νω of 1.27. Fig. 5 shows
PDH error signals, as obtained from the de-modulated
signal of PD2. Again, for values of νω approaching one,
the error signal is distorted, and shows oscillations.

IV. SWITCHING THE INPUT LIGHT
FREQUENCY

In another experiment, we used two RF-synthesizers
to switch the frequency of the input light ﬁeld. First the
input is kept in resonance with the cavity and the cavity
is ﬁlled. Then the frequency of the input light is switched
by 46 kHz and the output light intensity behind the cav-
ity is monitored. We observe an exponential decay, which
is sinusoidally modulated at the beat frequency between
the two input ﬁelds, see Fig. 6 for the data. We observe
that the initial phase of this modulation is changed when
the phase between both synthesizers varies.

V. PHASE MODULATION RESPONSE

As in the previous section, we use two synthesizers to
generate the drive for the AOM. Both frequencies are
kept in resonance with the fundamental cavity mode.
The cavity is ﬁlled with the ﬁrst source, then we switch to
the second source whose phase is at 180 degree to the ﬁrst
one. The intensity behind the cavity is monitored. Our
result is shown in Fig. 2b, where we observe an exponen-
tial decay and ﬁt a decay constant of 19.4 (0.4)µs. Note
that this decay is a factor of 1.95(0.05) faster than the
free cavity decay, observed after simply cutting oﬀ the
input light (Fig. 2a). This experimental ﬁnding agrees
well with the expected factor of two, since the input ﬁeld
intensity was kept constant. The second light ﬁeld, with
opposite phase to the ﬁrst one, builds up inside the cav-
ity and leads there to destructive interference. At the
instant, when the transmitted light from the cavity van-
ishes, we cut the second input ﬁeld to leave the cavity
empty (Fig.2 b, t
100 µs). One may wonder how the
stored light energy escapes: It leaves the cavity via the
input coupling mirror, where it interferes constructivly
with the input light ﬁeld. These ﬁndings lead immedi-
ately to the idea that the decay time of light in the cavity
can be shortened even beyond a factor of two if phase and
intensity of the second input ﬁeld are chosen properly.

VI. PHASE AND INTENSITY MODULATION
AND ACCELERATED CAVITY DECAY

As in the previous section, two input ﬁelds are used.
The ﬁrst, on resonance, ﬁlls the cavity and the second

is used to induce a cavity decay as fast as possible. We
set the intensity to twice that of the ﬁrst input ﬁeld,
2.3-times faster decay, with
and indeed observed a
16.9(0.7) µs. However, for the intensity switching, the
AOM drive power is increased, which also transiently af-
fects the phase. Thus, with the used setup it was impos-
sible to adjust the second light ﬁeld’s phase to be exactly
opposite to the ﬁrst one and to achieve an even faster
cancellation of the cavity ﬁeld.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have shown experimentally interference eﬀects
which occur when the input light ﬁeld of an optical cavity
is rapidly altered in frequency, phase and intensity. The
transmitted intensity is monitored to reveal a strongly
modiﬁed cavity decay.
In addition, the Pound-Drever-
Hall error signal in reﬂection, as used for laser frequency
stabilization, shows oscillations when the laser frequency
is scanned quickly over the cavity resonance. The PDH
signal, usually an antisymmetric signal with a zero cross-
ing (locking point) exactly at cavity resonance, may then
even exhibit a few oscillations and multiple zero crossings
1), and loses completely its shape. The conse-
(for νω ≥
quence is clear: If an ultra high ﬁnesse cavity (with nar-
row linewidth) is used for the frequency stabilization of a
laser with high frequency ﬂuctuations, the servo-loop for
the frequency locking will initially have some problems
to stabilize the laser’s frequency within the reference cav-
ity’s linewidth. Thus, a pre-stabilization [2] of the laser
becomes necessary to reduce its initial frequency jitter.

We have shown how the cavity decay time can be de-
creased below its normal value. This could have future
applications if a stored cavity ﬁeld has to be changed
rapidly. All observations agree well with the theoretical
predictions, which are based on the interference of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds, and which are outlined in this paper
and in M. J. Lawrence et al [11].

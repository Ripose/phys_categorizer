We show that soliton excitation in intracavity downconversion naturally selects a strictly deﬁned
frequency diﬀerence between the signal and idler ﬁelds.
In particular, this phenomenon implies
that if the signal has smaller losses than the idler then its frequency is pulled away from the cavity
resonance and the idler frequency is pulled towards the resonance and vice versa. The frequency
selection is shown to be closely linked with the relative energy balance between the idler and signal
ﬁelds.

Exchange of ideas between nonlinear optics and non-
linear dynamics of spatially distributed systems has pro-
duced a series of interesting results over the last decade,
and has opened up one of the most active areas of current
research. In this particular work we will consider novel
phenomena associated with soliton excitation in the prac-
tically and fundamentally important area of nondegener-
ate intracavity down-conversion.

The essence of parametric down-conversion is virtual
absorption of a pump photon at frequency ωp with a sub-
sequent reemission of two photons with frequencies ωi
and ωs, where indices i and s stand, respectively, for the
idler and signal ﬁelds. Down-conversion can be realized
both in free propagation and in intracavity schemes. The
latter takes advantage of positive feedback provided by
the mirrors and thus transforms the passive free propaga-
tion scheme into an active generator or optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) [1,2].

Inﬂuence of the transverse degrees of freedom on the
quantum [3] and classical [3–11] aspects of the parametric
processes have recently become a subject of signiﬁcant ac-
tivity. Among the main attraction points on the classical
side are localised structures [5–11]. Bright diﬀractionless
localised excitations inside an optical cavity supported
by diﬀerent nonlinearities (cavity solitons) have been re-
cently observed experimentally [12] and suggested for
all-optical processing and storage of information [9,13],
see also recent reviews [14]. The large quadratic nonlin-
earities of artiﬁcially phase matched materials [2] make
parametric cavity solitons [5–11] particularly attractive
for practical application, especially where fast material
response is an issue.

Down-conversion processes can be divided into degen-
erate and nondegenerate. In the former case idler and
signal photons are identical while in the latter they diﬀer
in frequencies and/or polarizations. It has been shown
that transverse patterns in nondegenerate OPO [4,5] and
soliton dynamics in nondegenerate free propagation [11]
have qualitative diﬀerences from their degenerate coun-
terparts. The diﬀerence can be formally identiﬁed as due
to an additional symmetry, in the diﬀerential phase of
signal and idler ﬁelds [11]. This symmetry is suppressed
in the degenerate case. As a result the frequency of the

signal component of any solution, including solitons, is
ωi = ωp/2. On
exactly half the pump frequency, ωs ≡
the other hand, in the nondegenerate case any arbitrary
frequency diﬀerence 2Ω between the idler and signal ﬁelds
still satisﬁes the condition ωp = ωs + ωi. This raises the
question of whether there are any physical constraints on
Ω.

While in free propagation the value of Ω is limited
only by phase matching conditions, this problem becomes
more subtle in the OPO because cavity eﬀects come into
play. A review of early works on this issue, exploring
approaches based on the plane wave approximation, can
be found in [1]. More recently Longhi [4] has shown that
if diﬀraction is included then Ω becomes a function of
the magnitude of the transverse component of the signal
and idler wave vectors, ~ki
~ks
⊥, of the exact trav-
⊥ =
elling wave solution which exists in this system [4]. For
ks,i
the ﬁxed OPO parameters
can take any values from
⊥ |
|
certain continuous bands and hence so can Ω.

−

The primary object of this Letter is to demonstrate
that Ω is constrained when a cavity soliton is excited in
the nondegenerate OPO. We show how this follows from
a general relation between the soliton energies and the
cavity losses. Existence of this relation, which has not
been previously identiﬁed in this context, seems to be
closely related to survival of diﬀerential phase symmetry
in the presence of cavity losses. We use this symmetry
to derive aproximate formulae for Ω in certain limits.
Understanding this problem is not only practically im-
portant, but also holds the key to construction of entire
families of cavity solitons.

Mean-ﬁeld equations describing interaction of the sig-
nal, idler and pump waves in OPO [3,4,8] can be pre-
sented in the dimensionless quasi-Hamiltonian form

suming, for simplicity, that ωs is close to ωi, we can

where δ = (δs + δi)/2. The previously introduced
frequency diﬀerence 2Ω between the idler and signal
ﬁelds is linked with the parameter ∆ by the formula:
δi)/(bτc) We are interested in bright
2Ω = (2∆ + δs −
single-hump solitons, implying Am(x = +
) = 0 and
∂xAm(x = 0) = 0. Existence of such solitons in the
parameter region where the trivial zero solution bifur-
cates subcritically can be predicted for ∆ = 0, γs = γi
by analogy with the well studied degenerate case, where
this condition reads δδp > γsγp [6,9,10]. In the nondegen-
erate case solitons have been found as a result of direct
(1) starting from either
numerical simulations of Eqs.
’random’ [5] or localized [8] initial conditions. Subcrit-
ical bifurcation and the related phenomenon of optical
bistability in the nondegenerate OPO have been demon-
strated experimentally in [15].

For ﬁxed cavity parameters solitons can exist either for
∆ continuously varying in a certain range or for only a
discrete set of ∆ values. We will show that the latter situ-
= 0. We thus assert that the cav-
ation is realised for γs,i 6
ity selects the frequency diﬀerence between the signal and
idler when a parametric soliton is excited. Note that the
related problem of frequency selection has been studied
in the general context of the complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation (CGLE) with subcritical bifurcation [16], which
also can be applied to describe laser with saturable ab-
sorber [12,17]. The possibility of the approximate re-
duction of Eqs. (1) to the CGLE in the diﬀerent limits

has been demonstrated in [8]. However, the problem of
the frequency selection by solitons in OPO has not been
previously formulated even within the framework of the
CGLE approximation. This fact has in turn prevented
construction of the family of stationary soliton solutions
of Eqs. (2) and rigorous study of their stability.

To start our analysis of the frequency selection, prob-

here γ± = (γs ±
steady state solution, such as soliton solutions of Eqs.
(2), the condition

γsQs = γiQi,

(4)

must be satisﬁed. Eq. (4) is consistent with the expec-
tation that the ﬁeld with the smaller losses will have the
larger energy.

To further interpret relations (3), (4) let us recall
that in free propagation downconversion is a Hamilto-
nian process. Then by Noether’s theorem every con-
tinuous symmetry implies a corresponding conservation
law, see e.g. [11]. Cavity losses destroy the Hamiltonian
structure of the problem, see Eqs.
(1), and the input
pump breaks the phase symmetry linked with conserva-
tion of the total energy (Qs + Qi + 2Qp). The symmetry
(Eseiψ, Eie−iψ) in the diﬀerential phase ψ,
(Es, Ei)
however, survives in the cavity conﬁguration, so how do
the losses change the associated law ∂tQ− = 0? Self-
evidently the relation (3) becomes this conservation law
in the Hamiltonian limit, which suggests a more general
link between this energy relation and the symmetry in
the diﬀerential phase.

Now using cavity solitons as an example we will demon-
strate that condition (4) constrains the frequency diﬀer-
ence of the signal and idler components of the intracavity
ﬁeld. We consider signal and idler losses small compare
to the cavity detunings γs,i/
1 and set b = 1. Con-

servation of Q− is restored for γs,i = 0 and thus Eq. (4)
is satisﬁed automatically. A soliton family then exists
for δ < 0, with ∆ continuously varying in the interval
δ). Outside this interval exponential localization of
(δ,

As,i is not possible. Now suppose that for γs,i ∼

ǫ, then Eq.
∆ becomes a slow function of t, i.e. ∂t∆
(3) immediately gives an equation for the adiabatic evo-
lution of ∆: ∂t∆
γ−Q+(∆).
For stationary soliton solutions ∂t∆ = 0 and intersec-
tions of the curve Qs/Qi as a function of ∆ with the line
Qs/Qi = γi/γs give selected values of ∆. We plot in Fig.
1(a) the existence curve corresponding to the numerically
built [18] single-hump soliton family in the plane (µ, ∆)

eral percent. Dots in Fig. 1(a) correspond to values of
∆ obtained by the perturbative method. The agreement
is excellent, which also indicates that the limit of small
cavity losses is non-singular. The latter is a necessary
condition for a linkage between Eq. (3) and the diﬀer-
ential phase symmetry. Typical transverse proﬁles of the
soliton components are presented in Fig. 1(b).

The new soliton family turns out to be stable over the
section (A, H) in Fig. 1(a). The Hopf instability of the
(H, B) branch, and the instability of the (O, A) branch
are similar to the case of the degenerate OPO [10]. At
the point B the single-hump branch bifurcates back in µ,
initiating a sequence of multi-hump solitons.

The above perturbation approach to ﬁnd selected val-
ues of ∆ requires γs,i small, which is satisﬁed in most
practical situations, but we also assumed δ
O(1). This
ǫ−1, which physically means
fails if γs,i/
O(1) or
that the cavity becomes tuned close to resonance with
the signal and idler ﬁelds. Then terms proportional to δ
in Eqs. (2) should also be considered as perturbations.
In this case Eqs. (2) simply do not have solitary solutions
in zero order and therefore Qs,i can’t be considered func-
tions of ∆. To overcome this diﬃculty we used another
perturbation approach, also based on the ψ-symmetry.
Note ﬁrst that the cavity solitons become wider on ap-
proach to resonance [19], and so to avoid large compu-
tational windows it is convenient to take large b, e.g.
1 physically corresponds to small
b = 2/Ts. Then γm ∼

a wide region of parameters. This implies that the sign of
γ− determines the sign of ∆, at least for parameter val-
ues where our perturbative approach is valid. Fig. 1(a)
and selective numerical checks in parameter regions far
outwith the validity of our perturbative methods sup-
port a conjecture that the relationship sgnγ− = sgn∆
has a general character. Note ﬁnally that any diﬀerence
in diﬀraction constants αs and αi will also aﬀect the fre-
quency selection, but we leave this mechanism for future
analysis.

To assess possibilities of experimental observation of
these cavity solitons let us take as an example a 1cm long
monolithic planar waveguide cavity with χ(2)

typical for a noncritically phase matched potassium nio-
bate crystal. Suppose the waveguide to be

To excite cavity solitons one can apply spatially lo-
calised optical pulses at any of the three frequencies. Op-
timisation of the pulse parameters goes beyond of our
present scope. However, to demostrate how the selection
of the frequency diﬀerence happens, we show in Fig. 3
results of direct simulation of Eqs. (1) with, as initial
condition, a pulse at frequency ωs with duration around
0.1τc, intensity several times the peak soliton intensity,
and width of order the soliton width. Intensities of all
three components of the excited soliton become constant
after a transient period, see Fig. 3(a), while the real
parts of the signal and idler ﬁelds exhibit undamped os-
cillations, conﬁrming selection of ∆ with the predicted
value, see Fig. 3(b).

The main physical conclusion which can be drawn from
the above results is that, if the signal has the smaller
losses its frequency is pulled away from the cavity res-
onance while the idler frequency is pulled towards reso-
nance and vice versa, see Figs. 1(a),2(a). If the signal
and idler losses are equal then the selected value of ∆
is zero, see Eq. (6), which implies that both the idler
and the signal are equally detuned from cavity resonance.
Thus the cavity structure balances the energies of the
idler and signal components during soliton excitation, in
(3), (4). The understanding of this
accord with Eqs.
frequency selection mechanism has allowed us to recon-
struct an entire family of single-hump cavity solitons and
to study their stability. Our results are likely to ﬁnd ap-
plications in interpretation of other spatio-temporal phe-
nomena in nondegenerate OPOs and also to be relevant
in other intracavity parametric processes with symmetry
in the diﬀerential phase, e.g., second harmonic generation

with competing parametric process [20] and nondegener-
ate four-wave mixing [21].

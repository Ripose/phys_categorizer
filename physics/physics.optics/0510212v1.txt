The precise observation of the angle-frequency spectrum of light ﬁlaments in water reveals a
scenario incompatible with current models of conical emission (CE). Its description in terms of
linear X-wave modes leads us to understand ﬁlamentation dynamics requiring a phase- and group-
matched, Kerr-driven four-wave-mixing process that involves two highly localized pumps and two
X-waves. CE and temporal splitting arise naturally as two manifestations of this process.

Filamentation of intense light pulses in nonlinear me-
dia has attracted much interest ever since ﬁrst exper-
imental evidences in the early ’60’s ([1] and references
therein). Owing to the very high intensities reached dur-
ing the process, several nonlinear phenomena, e.g., multi-
photon absorption, plasma formation, saturable nonlin-
ear response, stimulated Raman scattering etc., occur
in addition to the optical Kerr eﬀect. Indeed, the ﬁla-
ment regime is enriched by peculiar phenomena like pulse
splitting, self-steepening, shock-wave formation, super-
continuum generation, and conical emission (CE) [2]. In
media with normal group velocity dispersion (GVD), no
matter if of solid, liquid or gaseous nature, CE accom-
panies ﬁlamentation, producing radiation at angles that
increase with increasing detuning from the carrier fre-
quency [3, 4]. In spite of the generality of the process,
a clear understanding of the interplay between CE and
ﬁlament dynamics is still missing. Only recently, Kolesik
et al. have proposed an interpretation of ﬁlamentation
dynamics in water on the basis of pulse splitting and dy-
namic nonlinear X waves at the far ﬁeld [5], in which
the double X-like structure observed in simulated angle-
frequency spectra arises from the scattering of an incident
ﬁeld at the two main peaks of the split material response
wave.

Originally, CE in light ﬁlaments was interpreted in
terms of the modulation instability (MI) angle-frequency
gain pattern of the plane and monochromatic (PM)
modes of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NSE) [6, 7].
Measurements at large angles and detunings from the
carrier frequency gave in fact results fairly compatible
with this interpretation [8, 9]. In the present work, ow-
ing to the use of a novel imaging spectrograph technique
[3], we have been able to observe for the ﬁrst time the
CE in the region of small angles and detunings. The re-
sults clearly indicate a scenario not compatible with the

MI analysis of PM modes. Our description by means of
the spectra of the stationary linear X-waves supported
by the medium, indicates that the strong localization of
the self-focused ﬁeld plays a crucial role in the substantial
modiﬁcation experienced by the MI pattern. We propose
a simple picture in which the latter results from the para-
metric ampliﬁcation of two weak X-waves by the strong,
highly localized pump. Supporting this interpretation,
we are able to derive, from the matching condition among
the interacting waves, a simple analytical expression [Eq.
(4)] that accurately determines the overall CE structure,
and predicts also the splitting velocity of the pump wave
as a function of the peak intensity reached at collapse.

The experiment was carried out using a 3 cm long cell
ﬁlled with water as a bulk nonlinear Kerr medium. Beam
ﬁlamentation was induced by launching 200 fs pulses
at carrier wave length 527 nm, delivered from a mode-
locked, chirped-pulse regeneratively ampliﬁed, Nd:glass
laser with a 10 Hz repetition rate (Twinkle; Light Con-
version Ltd.). The pulse energy was controlled by use of
a half-wave plate and a Glan-Taylor polarizer. A spatial
ﬁlter guarantees high beam quality before focusing with
a f = 50 cm lens placed at 48 cm from the cell input
facet, with a beam diameter at half-maximum equal to
100 µm. The output facet is then imaged with a 4-f
telescope onto the rear focal plane of the lens (fF = 15
cm) used to obtain the spatial Fourier transform of the
ﬁlament generated in the Kerr sample. The input slit
of the imaging spectrograph (MS260i, Lot-Oriel) with
a high resolution 1200 lines/mm diﬀraction grating is
placed at a distance fF from the Fourier lens so as to
reconstruct the angle-wavelength (θ–λ) spectrum of the
ﬁlament on a commercial CCD 8-bit camera (Canon),
placed at the output plane of the spectrograph. With
the change λ = 2πc/(ω0 + Ω), the angle-frequency (θ–
Ω) spectrum can also be obtained, Ω being the detuning

from the carrier frequency ω0. More details of the exper-
imental layout may be found elsewhere [3]. We recorded
only single-shot spectra in order to avoid averaging ef-
fects due to possible shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations in the input
pulse energy. Moreover we highly saturated the central
peak of the spectrum so as to highlight the less visible
surrounding structure. For input energies Ein . 1.8 µJ,
no CE, or clear X-like features were observed. Figure 1
shows an example of θ–λ spectrum at Ein = 2 µJ. The
CE appears as distinctly separated red- and blue-shifted
X-shaped tails. This pattern remains very similar with
increasing input energy up to Ein ∼ 4 µJ, while further
increase produces a slowly deteriorating picture, with a
modulated intensity pattern that extends to nearly all
recorded values of θ and λ. We interpret this deteriora-
tion as due to the onset of local breakdown in the water
sample.

CE emission is commonly accepted to arise from the
interplay of diﬀraction, dispersion and nonlinear material
response, the simplest model that accounts for it being
the cubic NSE with normal GVD [6, 7]

An accepted approach for understanding the structure
of the CE relies upon the evaluation of the MI gain pro-
ﬁle of the PM modes of the NSE [6]. In Kerr self-focusing
media with normal dispersion, the perturbations to a PM
mode that grow at maximum rate are those whose spa-
tiotemporal frequencies (K⊥, Ω) are related by

proposed an intuitive picture that assumes the largest
MI gain to occur at angles and frequencies fulﬁlling the
linear phase-matching condition of the four-wave mixing
(FWM) process supported by the Kerr response [7]. Un-
der this hypothesis, the asymptotic linear approximation
K⊥(Ω) ≃
0 |Ω| was re-obtained, and the observed
discrepancies were attributed to the nonlinear phase shift
produced by the PM mode on the weak perturbation.

Preceding experimental observations of CE in borosil-
icate glass [8] and ethylene glycol [9] were indeed inter-
preted to present a hyperbolic structure with an angle
gap, which was also attributed to the nonlinear phase
shift. This trend is also visible in our measurements
1) as an intersection of the two X arms at a
(Fig.
non-zero angle.
(2) (taking
˜β and k′′
0 as free parameters) to the experimental data
[Fig.2(a), dotted line and closed circles, respectively] we
obtain k′′
0 = 0.053 ± 0.03 fs2/µm, which ﬁrmly sup-
ports the predictions [7] regarding the asymptotic slope
(k′′
0 = 0.055 fs2/µm at 527 nm [10]); however, the angle-
gap ﬁtting strongly departs from experimental data in
the non-asymptotic region, which strongly calls for a ﬁt-
ting to a hyperbola with opposite curvature, that is, to
a hyperbola with a frequency gap. This observation ad-
vocates a novel interpretation of the origin of CE.

To understand our proposal, note ﬁrst that the usual
MI interpretation of the seemingly angle-gap hyperbolic
CE can be equivalently reread in terms of the excitation
of a weak, linear X-wave mode by a strong, nonlinear
PM pump.
Indeed, Eq. (2) represents also the K⊥–Ω
spectrum of an X-wave mode of the medium [11], that is,
a diﬀraction- and dispersion-free pulsed Bessel beam in
which cone-angle-induced dispersion [θ(Ω) ≃ K⊥(Ω)/k0]
and material GVD balance mutually. The spectrum in
Eq. (2) belongs to a wave-mode of carrier frequency Ω0
and shortened axial wave vector k0 − ˜β. In this reading,
the excitation of a X-wave mode with angle-gap ( ˜β > 0)
is a consequence of the nonlinear phase matching be-
tween PM pump and X-wave for maximum eﬃciency of
the interaction: taking into account the nonlinear cor-
rections to the wave vectors of both pump and X-wave,
phase matching imposes k0 + ∆k = k0 − ˜β + 2∆k, where
∆k = ω0n2I/c is the positive nonlinear phase shift (in
self-focusing Kerr medium) for the PM pump of intensity
I, and where 2∆k is the corresponding nonlinear correc-

tion to the weak perturbation [8, 9], leading immediately
to ˜β = ω0n2I/c > 0 (as predicted by the standard MI
analysis [6]).

We also note that a medium with GVD [k(Ω) = k0 +
k′
0Ω+k′′
0 Ω2/2] supports more general X-wave modes with
strengthened and shortened wave vectors ( ˜β negative and
positive), as well as shifted carrier frequency ω0 + ˜Ω, their
most general K⊥–Ω spectrum being expressed by [11]

K⊥(Ω) = qk0k′′

0 (Ω − ˜Ω)2 + 2k0 ˜β,

( ˜β T 0).

(3)

Their phase and group velocities are given by v(p) =
(ω0 + ˜Ω)/[k( ˜Ω) − ˜β] and v(g) = 1/k′( ˜Ω), respectively,
which can take both subluminal and superluminal val-
ues. Equation (3) describes a two-parameter family of
k0k′′
0 ,
hyperbolas, sharing the same asymptotic slope
but admitting angle gaps ( ˜β > 0) and frequency gaps
( ˜β < 0), as well as positive and negative frequency shifts
˜Ω. X-wave spectra appear then as a suitable tool for the
description of the CE features.

p

The apparent frequency-gap hyperbolic form of the ob-
served CE, and the actual absence of such a gap, suggest
that the CE cannot be described in terms of a single X-
wave. This leads us to interpret the two observed X tails
as belonging to two diﬀerent X waves both featuring fre-
quency gaps, and proceed to ﬁt Eq. (3) with two indepen-
dent sets of parameters ˜Ω and ˜β (and k′′
0 = 0.056 fs2/µm)
to the experimental data. This procedure also ﬁnds moti-
vation in the X-X structure of the numerically evaluated
angular spectra of light ﬁlaments in water, which was
interpreted to be a consequence of pulse splitting on X-
wave generation [5]. Fittings with ˜Ω = +0.33, −0.33 fs−1
and ˜β = −2.2, −2.2 mm−1 (dashed and continuous lines,
respectively) reproduce accurately the structure of the
CE [Fig. 2(a)]. The interpretation in term of X-waves
leads moreover to suspect the existence of two additional,
not yet observed X arms in the K–Ω spectrum at wave-
lengths 450 and 635 nm [Fig. 2(a)].

To verify this prediction, we performed additional mea-
surements with a lower resolution, 300 lines/mm diﬀrac-
tion grating in order to cover a wider spectral region, as
shown in Fig. 2(b). Alongside the central tails (around
527 nm), we clearly observe the generation of new fre-
quencies in the vicinity of 450 and and 635 nm, as ex-
pected. The reduced visibility of the red tail at 635 nm
can be attributed to the stronger linear absorption at this
wavelength. In fact, we had to increase the input pulse
energy up to Ein = 3 µJ in order to enhance the overall
intensity of the new tails.

The question then arises of the mechanism responsi-
ble for the described spectral structure. Here we pro-
pose that the double X-like CE is a result of a nonlinear
FWM interaction —the lowest order process supported
by the nonlinear Kerr response—, in which two signal
and idler X-waves experience a parametric ampliﬁcation
by a strong, highly localized (i.e., non PM) pump. If as

consistently with the self-focusing dynamics, we consider
a strongly localized pump rather than a PM wave, it is
expected that nonlinear phase modulation does not in-
ﬂuence signiﬁcantly an extended object such an X-wave
mode, whose axial wave vector is solely determined by
its cone angle, that is, by its weak, longstanding tails far
from the pump. In fact, in the X-wave the energy does
not ﬂow along the axial direction, but along a conical
surface, which prevents pump-induced cross-phase accu-
mulation to take place.

Under this assumption, phase matching between a lo-
calized pump and a single X-wave at same frequency
ω0 would require k0 + ∆k = k0 − ˜β, a condition that
contrarily to the case of a PM pump, is satisﬁed by a
frequency-gap X-wave mode ( ˜β = −∆k < 0). More gen-
erally, if k = k0 + ∆k is the nonlinear pump wave num-
ber, and ks,i = k( ˜Ωs,i) − ˜βs,i are two, signal and idler, X
wave numbers, where k( ˜Ωs,i) = k0 + k′
s,i/2,
and Ωs,i are their carrier frequency shifts, the conditions
of energy and momentum conservation, ˜Ωs = − ˜Ωi and
2k = ks + ki, for maximum eﬃciency of a FWM pro-
cess involving two (degenerate) highly localized pumps
and the signal and idler X waves, leads to the relation
˜βs + ˜βi − k′′
s,i = −2∆k. Among all possible couples of
X-wave modes satisfying this relation, those whose spec-
tra cross the pump, located around Ω = 0, K⊥ = 0, are

the most energetically favored, since these X-waves will
not need to grow from noise, but from the more eﬀec-
tive pump self-phase modulation. This condition was
also found in [12] to result in the largest gain in the
case of a single X wave excited by a travelling pump.

Eq. (4) predicts also a precise dependence of the whole
CE structure on the pump intensity I, whose validity we
have tested numerically. We solved the NSE (1) with
0 = 0.056 fs2/µm, n = 1.33 and n2 = 1.6 × 10−16
k′′
cm2/W, for an input 200 fs-long, 100 µm-wide (FWHM)
Gaussian wave packet. Since CE is seen to develop explo-
sively at the collapse, we identiﬁed the pump intensity I
with the absolute peak intensity reached during propaga-
tion. In order to attain diﬀerent values of this intensity
without changing the rest of parameters, we added to the
second member of the NSE (1) the nonlinear dissipation
term −β(K)|A|KA/2, with K = 3 (three-photon absorp-
tion at 527 nm in water), and with β(K) ranging from
1.2 × 10−23 to 8 × 10−25 cm3/W2. The K⊥ − Ω spec-
tra obtained numerically are symmetric with respect to
Ω = 0 due to the approximations involved in the NSE,
and present a nearly invariant X-X structure beyond the
collapse point (in spite of the quickly decreasing peak
intensity I), with one tail of each X wave nearly pass-
ing through Ω = 0, as observed experimentally. The

spectrum at 3 cm from the input plane was then easily
ﬁtted with two, signal and idler, material X-waves modes
crossing Ω = 0 [i.e., with k′′
0 = 0.056 fs2/µm, and with
˜Ωs,i = ±(−2 ˜βs,i/k′′
0 )1/2], ˜βs,i being then the only one free
parameter. Figure 3 shows the values of ˜βs,i, obtained
from the best ﬁts to the spectra, versus pump intensity
I (open squares). The excellent agreement with the pre-
dicted ˜βs,i–I dependence in Eq. (4) (solid line) strongly
supports the FWM analysis.

Extending further our interpretation, we conjecture
that the well-known phenomenon of pulse temporal split-
ting in ﬁlamentation with normal GVD, usually de-
scribed from a purely temporal perspective, is a conse-
quence of higher-order matching among the interacting
waves —in our case, of group matching. Indeed, the zero-
order, phase-matching condition (4) entails that the two
X-waves must travel at diﬀerent group velocities v(g)
s,i =
1/k′(Ωs,i) = 1/[k′
0 Ωs,i], and therefore split apart in
time one from another with a group velocity mismatch

portional to the square root of the pump intensity. Group
matching among the interacting waves is then better at-
tained if the two pump waves, breaking their initial de-
generacy, split also to co-propagate with the X-waves. In
this view, pulse splitting is not a mere collapse-arresting
mechanism [7], which further determines, taken it for
granted, the generation of two X-waves [5]; instead, pulse
splitting emerges here as a particular feature of the phase
and group matched wave conﬁguration most favored by
the FWM nonlinear interaction inherent to the Kerr NSE
dynamics. In other words, X-wave instability or paramet-
ric ampliﬁcation, and splitting instability are not inde-
pendent phenomena, but two aspects of the same process.
To sustain this hypothesis, we have evaluated the GVM
of the split pumps in the same numerical simulations as in
the preceding paragraph. To do so, we plotted the tem-
poral proﬁles at diﬀerent propagation distances beyond
collapse, and obtained the GVM as the slope of a linear
ﬁtting to the delay between the two temporal peaks ver-
sus propagation distance. Figure 3 shows that the pump
GVM (open circles) does not depart more than 10 per-
cent from the predicted X-wave GVM (solid curve), and
that both follow a similar dependence with the square
root of the intensity I at collapse.

In summary, our experiments demonstrate that CE
emission in the angular spectrum of ﬁlaments is not in-
terpretable in the frame of MI of PM modes of the NSE.
Strong localization of the self-focusing pulse substantially
modiﬁes the MI pattern, which ﬁnds accurate description
in terms of linear X-wave modes of the medium, and sim-
ple explanation as a result of a dominant, phase-matched
FWM mixing process supported by the NSE dynamics
between two highly localized, strong pump waves and
two amplifying weak X-waves. Pulse temporal splitting
emerges in this model as the necessary temporal dynam-

ics for preserving group matching among the interacting
waves.

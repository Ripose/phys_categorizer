Luminescence is the phenomenon investigated and applied in many disciplines of science and tech-
nique. Spectral and kinetic measurements of luminescence provide much information concerning the
mechanism of luminescent devices. Better understanding of the mechanism allows to improve the
devices. It has been known for a long time that the spectral and kinetic properties of luminescence
depend on the temperature [1]. It is assumed that ﬂuorescence does not depend on temperature but
practically lifetime of ﬂuorescence changes insigniﬁcantly with temperature [1, 2]. Until now, to our
knowledge, nobody describes mathematically the dependence. Here is reported the model of photon
emission permitting a description of the dependence. It is found that lifetime of ﬂuorescence de-
creases with increasing the square root of temperature. The dependence is weaker than temperature
dependence of phosphorescence. It agrees with experimental observations. In the model presented,
the new application of Maxwell distribution is shown. This idea can be used in other investigations.
Also the presented model can be applied, for example, in nuclear physics.

Temperature inﬂuences the luminescence properties of
materials. It is shown, in many papers, that temperature
changes the shape of luminescence spectra [3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11]. With increasing temperature, some bands
of luminescence spectrum can increase or decrease in in-
tensity. Also, in some cases, some bands or lines can be
shifted. Temperature eﬀects also on kinetic properties of
luminescence. Measurements of the kinetic properties are
highly important since they provide much information
concerning the luminescent centers and the mechanism
of luminescence in general. Therefore, numerous papers
have been devoted to the lifetime of luminescence because
the parameter determines properties of luminescence cen-
ters [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In
several papers there is mathematical description of the
lifetime. There is mathematical description of depen-
dence of the ﬂuorescence lifetime on crystal thickness,
average absorption coeﬃcient and intrinsic ﬂuorescence
decay time but not on temperature [11]. In order to ex-
plain the temperature dependence of the lifetime of ﬂuo-
rescence, the model of photon emission from luminescent
centers is proposed.

Let us assume that:

(i) Luminescent center is
some kind of trap for photons. (ii) Trapped pho-
ton and electron create new particle like radioac-
tive atom. (iii) Motion of the particle is periodic.
The period tc of the motion is the time required
to complete one round trip of the motion, that is,
one complete cycle. (iv) Speed of the particle in
the motion is governed by Maxwell distribution.
(v) Photon can only be emitted from lumines-
cent center at the same point of the cycle path.
(vi) During time dt, the particle has speeds be-
tween v and v +dv; dt = dn seconds, where dn plays
the same role as number of molecules in classical
Maxwell distribution.

ticle is

where a is constant. The average speed obtained from
Maxwell distribution is

where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute tem-
perature and b is constant. From (1) and (2) we obtain

where c is constant. Because lifetime of luminescence τ
and tc are constant, we can write

v =

v = b√kT ,

where d is constant. The temperature dependence is con-
siderably weaker than that observed in phosphorescence.
The model proposed explains why, contrary to — for ex-
ample — Cherenkov’s radiation, luminescence appears
after some time longer than about 10−10 s.

Conclusions resulted from the model are following:
(i) If the luminescent centers are monomolecular and if
the rectangular exciting pulse is very long then, during
the time t = tc after the end of the exciting pulse, the
luminescence intensity is constant and equal to lumines-
cence intensity at the end of the pulse, when direct im-
pact excitation is the only process. Time dependence of
the luminescence after the end of the pulse is staircase
curve.
(ii) Trapped photon can only be emitted from
luminescent center at time t = ntc, where n is natural
number.

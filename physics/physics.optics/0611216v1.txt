Theory of directional pulse propagation: detailed calculations

P. Kinsler
Department of Physics∗, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BW, United Kingdom.
(Dated: December 25, 2013)

I construct combined electric and magnetic ﬁeld variables which independently represent energy
ﬂows in the forward and backward directions respectively, and use these to re-formulate Maxwell’s
equations. The emphasis is on detailed calculations, with a more general overview being published
in Phys. Rev. A72 and arXiv. These directional variables enable us to not only judge the eﬀect and
signiﬁcance of backward-travelling ﬁeld components, but also to discard them when appropriate.
They thereby have the potential to simplify numerical simulations, leading to potential speed gains
of up to 100% over standard FDTD or PSSD simulations. These ﬁeld variables are also used to
derive both envelope equations useful for narrow-band pulse propagation, and a second order wave
equation. Alternative deﬁnitions are also presented, along with their associated wave equations.

This report should be read along with the paper Phys.Rev.A72, 063807 (2005) “Theory of directional pulse propa-

gation”, by P. Kinsler, S.B.P. Radnor, G.H.C. New, for proper context.

This document is primarily intended as a complete (as possible) record of the calculational steps that were necessarily
abbreviated (or omitted) from that published work; it also contains a great many other relevant calculations along
with some speculation. It is an edited version of a longer document from which on-going work has been excised; and,
as a ”work in progress”, despite my best eﬀorts, may contain occasional mistakes. Please contact me if you have any
comments, corrections or queries.

INTRODUCTION

We deﬁne ﬁeld variables with directional properties, and use them to show how to optimise both our understanding
of pulse propagation and numerical simulations. Simple plane-polarized versions of these were originally introduced
µ1/2Hy. However, these were little used and the bulk of the paper primarily addressed
by Fleck [1], using ǫ1/2Ex ±
generating ultra-short pulses by Q-switched lasers, discussing numerical techniques and simulation results. Here
we derive wave equations and present results using generalised versions of these ﬁeld variables. In the course of our
investigations, we use these variables to illuminate several interesting features of z-propagated optical pulse simulations
which are usually overlooked in a “forward-only” approximation.

The main novelty of these new ﬁeld variables is that they correspond to forward and backward directed energy
ﬂuxes; and are constructed from combinations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, along with the properties of the
propagation medium.

I also derive wave equations describing the propagation of these ﬁeld components, in fully vectorised and plane-
polarized versions. In addition to these exact re-expressions of Maxwell’s equations, I also present second order and
envelope-based wave equations for G±, in both stationary and moving frames. A further advantage of this approach
is that it is as easy to include magneto-optic eﬀects as electro-optics ones (i.e. dispersion and nonlinearity). For
example, I will later show that the plane polarized ﬁrst order wave equations describing the z-propagation of G± in
the spectral (ω) domain are –

where αr = √ǫL, βr = √µL contain the linear response of the medium, and αc contains nonlinearity that aﬀects the
electric ﬁeld, and βc is its magnetic counterpart. Using these forward and backward directed G± variables has three
main advantages:

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

The forward directed ﬁeld variable G+ is the appropriate physical choice to use when studying the forward

•
propagating part of the ﬁeld – as is the case for most pulse propagation investigations.

Because we can choose to simulate only the forward directed ﬁeld variable G+, we have half the calculations
•
to do, and hence gain a speed advantage. By using a z-propagated PSSD algorithm[4], we also get a fast and
ﬂexible treatment of dispersive and nonlinear eﬀects; hence our simulations signiﬁcantly outperform standard FDTD
approaches.

Most other approaches (even the recent [5]) assume the backward propagating parts of the ﬁeld are negligible. Since
•
our G− describes the backward directed part, we have a clear and physically appropriate basis on which to calculate
it, and hence can (when appropriate) rigorously justify the common forward-only approximation.

We can do even better by changing to a co-moving frame. This simpliﬁes the G+ propagation, by removing the
frequency-like oscillations, but has the price of making the G− oscillations faster. However, in the limit where we
decide to approximate by ignoring the backward propagating G− part of the ﬁeld, this price becomes irrelevant.

A. Why am I doing this? An anecdotal history

Fleck’s deﬁnitions were brought to my attention by Geoﬀ New shortly after I started working with at Imperial
in 2001. Because they gave rise to additional d/dt terms in the polarization, when compared to standard forms, he
wondered whether there was a link with the Brabec and Krausz derivation[8] of similar-looking corrections to an
envelope propagation equation. Although it turns out that this was not the case, I continued working on the idea.
At ﬁrst I focussed on generating a second order wave equation of G±, in analogy to the one usually presented for the
E ﬁeld. Although I generalized my GFEA derivation [7, 9] to include Fleck-like terms, there seemed no practical use
for the technique.

In 2002 a PhD student in our group (JCA Tyrrell) started working on Maxwell’s equations solvers, and applying
them to pulse propagation in nonlinear media. He developed the PSSD method [4] for solving Maxwell’s equations,
where the ﬁeld is held as a function of time and propagated forward in space. This is common in envelope-based
nonlinear optics simulations, but had not been applied to full Maxwell’s solvers before. This got me thinking about
representing Maxwell’s equations using G±, and put the project on track to being of practical use, although there were
many outstanding questions on interpretation of the ﬁelds and the wave equations While trying to clarify these issues,
I became aware of work by Kolesik and co-workers [5, 6]), who projected out Maxwell’s equations into a directional
form. Their treatment motivated me on to vectorize the deﬁnitions, and get a PhD student (SBP Radnor) to start
on simulations. As we worked on the paper eventually published as [2], I further generalised the deﬁnitions to include
the longitudinal parts of the ﬁelds, fully developed the variant forms of the variables, and derived envelope versions
of the wave equations.

As it stands, these kinds of directional wave equations, either using my G± variables, or the Kolesik et.al. approach
make traditional envelope theories based on the second order wave equation for E utterly redundant. This is true
even for the generalised ones such as [7, 8] which incorporate wideband corrections. Directional wave equations simple
provide propagation equations without introducing the many approximations inherent in theories based on second
order forms, as are detailed exaustively in [7, 9]. This is treated in more detail in my report “Field and envelope
methods in nonlinear optics”.

I am occasionally asked why I picked G± instead of (e.g.) F ± to name these directional ﬁelds – after all, F follows
alphabetically from the electric ﬁeld (letter) E, and it is the ﬁrst letter of Fleck’s surname, so it might seem the more
obvious choice. Unfortunately I can’t remember why; but there was a reason why I passed over F , I think something
to do with some other F I was using at the time. I should have picked K ±, anyway.

B. An alternative approach

1. Kolesik, Moloney, and Mlejnek; PRL 89, 283902 (2002); and projection operators

Kolesik et.al.

[6] also use not-dissimilar combinations of ﬁeld variables. They introduce projection operators for

the forward and backward parts of the ﬁeld in their eqn (KMM 1), which I rewrite slightly using ~u = ~k/

:

~k

They then use these, with Maxwell’s equations to generate their UPPE in eqn (KMM 7):

There are three main diﬀerence compared with my generalised Fleck-style G± approach. They:

1. describe things in terms of projection operators,

2. project out both a directional D and a directional H,

3. construct their (eﬀective) directional variables in a diﬀerent (but related) way.

∇×

Another diﬀerence is that, when implimenting a solution, they keep the time derivatives on the LHS, and manipulate
the
terms on the RHS; so their UPPE gives a time derivative of the ﬁeld, and so their ﬁelds are propagated through
on the LHS, and manipulates the time derivatives –
time. This contrasts with my approach which keeps the
hence my ﬁelds are propagated through space. Their choice is (most probably) why they choose to work with the
displacement ﬁeld D rather than E. In the time domain, the use of D avoids the need for the D = ǫ
E convolution
of the ﬁeld with the permittivity, at least on the time-derivative side of the Maxwell’s equations. They (presumably)
terms when going into the spatial frequency (k) domain, leading
remove the space derivatives resulting from the
to the appearance of K terms on the RHS.

∇×

∇×

∗

However it is not so easy to avoid complication when solving Maxwell’s equations. Their use of D simpliﬁes the
time derivative side, but there is a cost to pay on the space derivative (
) side, where they need to reconstruct E
from D (see eqn (DMN 2)), and similarly evaluate the nonlinearity (see eqn (DMN 3)). Even then, just prior to eqn
(DMN 7), Kolesik et.al. explain how they go into the frequency domain anyway! As an aside, they might easily have
used B and not H in their equations, and so included the possibility of magnetic media in their model.

∇×

In contrast, I leave the space derivative (

) sides alone, and work with the time derivative side. This has the
advantage that when I go into the frequency domain, the convolution becomes a simple product, and I do not have to
resort to reconstructions of E and PN L. It is interesting to compare the “∂t” UPPE with my similar-looking “∂z” eqn
(4.1.8) that follows later, where they neglect to introduce the advantages of a co-moving frame (cf my eqn(4.3.14)).
See also III G, where I attempt a conversion between my formulation and theirs.
SUMMARY: Maxwell-like theory with combined G-like variables, but no co-moving frame. Temporal propagation
only.

2. Kolesik and Moloney; PRE 70, 036604 (2004).

This work [5] is an extension of the method proposed in [6], and contains a variety of applications. It discusses
both t and z propagated approaches, and includes decomposition into transverse modes. They develop an envelope
version of their wave equation, but do not discuss using multiple envelopes. In general they only solves for E, not
both E and H separately, there is also no examination (or calculation) of the signiﬁcance of backward propagating
ﬁelds. They separate the polarization P from displacement D; and includes current terms. See also III G, where I
attempt a conversion between my formulation and theirs.

C. Moving frames

In Fidel et.al. 1997 [10] ”Hybrid Ray FDTD moving window approach to pulse propagation”, they look at a variety
of moving window and moving frame approaches to solving for pulse propagation with Maxwell’s equations using
FDTD. They do introduce a co-moving frame, and derive the appropriate discretized Maxwell’s equations; but they
do not use combined E and B variables as done by Fleck, and as done in the following sections here.
SUMMARY: Maxwell-like theory with co-moving frame, but no combined G-like variables.

D. Beltrami Fields, Photon Wave Functions: ~E + ı ~B

The ~G± ﬁelds I constuct here bear a superﬁcial resemblance to Beltrami variables [11, 12, 13, 14], which are deﬁned
along the lines of ~Q = √ǫ ~E + ı√µ ~H. However, they diﬀer in two important respects. First, for a given Beltrami ~Q you
immediately know what the component ~E and ~H ﬁelds are, whereas you require both ~G± to do the same. Secondly,
~Q does not assume any preferred direction, whereas the construction of ~G± requires a direction ~u to be chosen. It’s
eıφH). However, since
interesting to wonder whether the E
E
H is not unique without both components, so it’s not obvious how
it might work.

ıH approaches might generalise to something like E

II. THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES: REFERENCE AND CORRECTION PARAMETERS

Maxwell’s equations describe propagation of the EM ﬁeld through a medium described by permittivity ǫ and
permeability µ. In addition, it is common to add in a “polarization” term ~P , which is used to relate the displacement
ﬁeld ~D to ~E in the usual way: ~D = ǫ
~E + ~P . In my treatment, I hide this polarization inside the deﬁnition of ǫ
~E for the same system); similarly any magnetic polarization would be hidden inside µ
(writing instead just ~D = ǫ
and not written out separately. Note that I do make a split of the total permittivity (and also the permeability) into
two pieces, a “reference” part and a “correction” part, and these will not necessarily be the same as the traditional
division.

The deﬁnitions of G± (and their generalized vector counterparts ~G±, introduced below) depend on the properties
of the propagation medium through the permittivity ǫ and permeability µ. In principle it might seem attractive to
deﬁne ~G± using the exact values of ǫ, µ (including the nonlinearity), but we will usually want to be able to uniquely
reconstruct the ﬁelds E and H from our new ﬁelds. We do this by including as much as possible of the dispersive
properties in the reference parameters (and hence the deﬁnitions of ~G±), leaving nonlinear properties (and potentially
some residual dispersion) for correction terms. For example, if the true dispersion was multi-valued or zero in places,

it is possible to deﬁne the reference to include an approximation to the true dispersion without those inconvenient
properties, and use the correction term to compensate.

The frequency domain is the starting point for calculating the necessary parameters. This is because the formulae
are simplest in the ω domain, where any linear response is described using products rather than convolutions. This
will mean that we calculate the time-domain parameters by (back) Fourier transforming the frequency domain ones.
The frequency domain deﬁnitions are

r (ω) ˜H(ω) + ˜βr(ω) ˜βc(ω)
where the correction parameters ˜ǫc and ˜µc represent the discrepancy between the true values and the reference.
The smaller these correction terms are, the better the match. By using these frequency dependent parameters in
the generalized deﬁnitions of G±, we will be able to propagate pulses using only the G+ variable, a gain in both
mathematical simplicity and computational speed. Note that since the deﬁnitions of G± depend (roughly speaking)
on the square roots of ˜ǫ and ˜µ, we have introduced the ˜α and ˜β parameters, which will feature prominently (along
with their time domain counterparts α, β), in the generalized deﬁnitions of ~G± that follow.

To recap, I split the medium properties into two parts:
First, there are the “reference” parts ǫr and µr. These are the contributions from the material properties which
will be incorporated into the deﬁnition(s) of G±. These will only contain linear response terms, to guarantee we can
reconstruct E, H from G±

Second, there are the “correction” parts ǫc(t) and µc(t), which will contain the diﬀerence between the chosen
reference and the true behaviour of the material. These will only contain any nonlinear response terms, but may also
contain an residual linear response also.

We might also choose to split the correction terms up into more pieces – e.g. a dispersive part, and a nonlinear

part: e.g.,

B. Nonlinearity

Since it is usually impractical to include nonlinearities in the reference parameters, these will normally appear
in the correction terms ǫc, µc. As an example, consider a n-th order (electric) nonlinearity, in which case ǫc(t) =
χ(n)(t)

where F[...] is the Fourier transform (FT) from time to frequency, and E(t) can be found from eqn.
If
(2.2.2)
the reference parameters ˜αr contain dispersion (which will be the typical case), we can see from eqn.
that this will make ˜αc(ω) dispersive even if χ(n) is instantaneous.
In the case of an instantaneous nonlinear-
ity, this adds more computational work (an extra two FTs), although for non-instantaneous ones we needed the
FTs anyway. If the nonlinearity is instantaneous and the reference parameters are non-dispersive, we have simply

In practise, therefore, calculation of an instantaneous nonlinear term will involve calculating χ(n)E(t)n, fourier
tranforming (denoted by F) the result, then dividing it by the (possibly frequency dependent) reference parameter
αr. If the reference parameter αr is a constant, then the fourier transform is redundant and the nonlinear step can
be handled while remaining entirely in the time domain. Note that there is no way we can avoid convolutions if
the reference αr contains any frequency dependence – even if our nonlinearity is instantaneous. This is because to
calculate αc I have to remove the reference αr from ˜ǫc; since αc(ω) = ˜ǫc(ω)/αr(ω).

III. DEFINITIONS OF ~G±

Here I go signiﬁcantly further than Fleck[1] in two respects: I vectorise the deﬁnitions, and allow for dispersive
eﬀects. An important addition is the inclusion of a longitudinal ﬁeld component, which is required in order to retain
a full vector description of the EM ﬁeld. Originally I tried to generate a motivation for the directional G± ﬁelds
described above by taking Maxwells equations and moving to a co-moving frame. However, it seems now that while
they certainly seem to describe parts of the ﬁeld propagating in opposite directions, they do not seem tied to any
particular choice of frame.

After a brief discussion of what Fleck did, I deﬁne a vector form ~G± of the Fleck-style ﬁelds G±. This requires the
deﬁnition of a “direction of propagation” denoted by the constant unit vector ~u. I can then achieve the swapping of
the transverse components of ~H (since Gx ∼
Hy) by using the cross product of ~u with the magnetic ﬁeld variable
~H.

Ex ±

Secondly I use “reference” material parameters which I use to construct my G± ﬁelds. This allows me to distinguish
between the parameters used in my construction of G± from the actual material properties, which may be too
complicated to use in that context. Generally, I include all of the linear response of the medium in these reference
parameters, which makes it easiest to deﬁne ~G± in the frequency domain. This is because the linear time-response
convolution in the time-domain becomes a simple product in the frequency domain. A good (accurate) choice of
reference medium for a particular problem will ensure that the contribution due to the backward directed part of
the ﬁeld (G−) is small. In general we would want the reference part to include as much about the material as is
practicable, to ensure the smallest possible correction term(s) for propagation.

Note that whether or not the ǫ, µ contain dispersion, we here restrict ourself to the case where they are scalar. Also,
I let the argument of the vector ﬁeld quantities tell us whether we are in the time or frequency domain, to avoid too
much notational clutter. As a ﬁnal note, in the following calculations the assumption will be made that the media
are bulk, without (implicit) interfaces hidden in ǫ or µ. This means that ∂zǫ = ∂zµ = 0 is assumed.

A. Fleck’s approach

Fleck deﬁnes a relative permittivity ǫ, and magnetic permeability µ in a dispersionless host medium – it is clear
that these are relative parameters because he later deﬁnes η = (ǫµ)1/2 as the refractive index of the of host medium
(just after eqn (F1.4b)). He allows for a Conductivity σ; and a Polarization P which characterises the active atoms
and which may be amplifying or absorbing. The electric ﬁeld is Ex and the magnetic ﬁeld By = µHy. As usual, the
speed of light c is just related to the permittivity and permeability of the vacuum, i.e. (ǫ0µ0)−1/2. Fleck simpliﬁes
plane polarised Maxwell ﬁeld equations, treating them only along the z direction, resulting in his eqn.(F1.1a,b)

Then Fleck deﬁnes new combined EM ﬁeld variables E± in eqn.(F1.3), but I write them G± to avoid confusion

with the E ﬁeld variables.

G± = ǫ1/2Ex ±
Because of the relative phases of E and H in these deﬁnitions, if the the two ﬁelds G+ and G− are constants
multiplied by a standard exponentially oscillating carrier wave, they are associated with an energy ﬂux (i.e. Poynting
vector) in opposite directions along the z axis; this will presumably also hold nearly true when replacing the constant
amplitude with “slowly varying” pulse envelopes. See also section VIII.

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

The “standard” deﬁnition for directional ﬁelds handles the electric ﬁeld E most easily; although rather non-
intuitively we will ﬁnd that it makes it hard to include longitudinal E components. Fortunately, other deﬁnitions
are possible, and these follow the standard “Primary ~E” deﬁnition presented next in subsection III C, in subsections
III D, III E, and III F.

Use of an alternative deﬁnition can protentially shift the non-transverse eﬀects to a ﬁeld variable where it causes
less trouble. Note that circularly polarized forms can be generated for all types the same way as is described for
primary- ~E type ~G± variables in subsubsection III C 2.

These alternative expressions are represented only in the frequency domain; time domain forms are presented for
primary- ~E only; for the other forms it is a simple matter to construct their time domain representation. In the case
of dispersionless reference media (i.e. constant ǫr(ω), µ(ω)), the time and frequency forms look very similar. The set
of alternative deﬁnitions was (partly) inspired by PDD suggesting (private communication, 24 February 2003) trying
alternative combinations – such as swapping D for E and/or B for H.

C. Primary ~E: the standard vector form

This vector deﬁnition of directional ﬁelds most closely mirrors the simple form suggested by Fleck. For completeness,
~H means that the ~G± will not

I will write them down in both time and frequency domains. Note that the use of ~u

Barring my dropping of the sgn(kz) factor, their D± can clearly be identiﬁed with my “primary D” formulation
of directional ﬁelds (see III E). Of course, there are diﬀerences, notably that their dispersion is only applied to the
magnetic ﬁeld (either H or B); my “primary E” formulation applied ǫ dispersion to E only, and µ dispersion to H
only.

They also present an equation for a directional H which corresponds to the “primary B” form (F ′) as opposed to

the D (F ) one.

It is often useful to transform the following wave equation derivations into a moving frame. The frame will be
deﬁned by the speed cf = 1/αf βf in analogy to the reference and correction parameters above. A sensible choice of
cf is probably helpful, e.g. cf = cr or possibly cf = vg, the pulse group velocity.

The (non relativistic) z-direction frame translation itself is

so that

When doing vector calculations, I will need a vector form of the frame translation. I use

I will often ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne the ratio of the reference and frame speeds:

This moving frame is very useful in a space-propagated model since the pulse is held as a function of time, and so
it will stay (nearly) centered while propagating forward. Although it has no sensible limit as the frame speed tends to
zero, we can recover that case by setting αf βf = 0 (or ξ = 0) and rewriting the primed variables as unprimed ones.

ξ = αf βf /αrβr

In the frequency domain, the space derivative transforms like

1. Frequency domain

∂z′ = ıω ˜αf ˜βf + ∂z

(3.8.11)

which seems to leave open the intriguing possibility of a frequency dependent (“dispersive”) moving frame by
allowing ˜αf and ˜βf a frequency dependence. I could put all the linear evolution in the reference, and match it to the
frame (so that αf = αr and βf = βr and ξ = 1). This means that the only alterations to the pulse proﬁle would be
those due to nonlinear eﬀects.

We might hope to use a dispersive frame in the following way. Imagine a pulse being propagated in a strongly
dispersive medium with some nonlinearity; and that the pulse might be expected to broaden by a large factor of
(e.g.) twenty during propagation. This would mean we would need a much wider time window in our simulation than
suggested by the initial pulse width. In a dispersive frame matched to a dispersive reference medium, our simulated
pulse would not broaden at all due to dispersion, so we then hope retain a narrow time window throughout the
simulation, hence saving computer time. The drawback is that our nonlinear term absorbs the reference dispersion,
and this may cause signiﬁcant pulse broadening of itself, perhaps of similar extent to the dispersion would. Assuming
it did give an advantage, at the end of the simulation we would have to take our dispersive-frame pulse and convert
back to a non-dispersive frame to see the “lab” pulse proﬁle. Fortunately the computational cost of this conversion is
minimal.

I. Pseudo-Beltrami forms

Weiglhofer and Lakhtakia [11] present a number of quantities related to the EM ﬁeld using their Beltrami style

deﬁnitions. If I rearrange the factors of µ’s and ǫ, I might rewrite these as

IV. FIRST ORDER EVOLUTION EQUATIONS: PRIMARY ~E

Here I derive coupled wave equations for the ~G± ﬁelds deﬁned in III C. I also discuss how things look in various frames
of reference, and in subsection IV B generate ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations for forward and backward propagating
ﬁelds. In the following I do not introduce any envelope-carrier decomposition for the ﬁeld variables; although the
introduction of a moving frame plays a related role. Note that the Vector Stationary Frame subsection (IV B) also
contains the plane-polarized special case, as well as a transformation to the moving frame as well; and should be
considered to contain the authoritative results. Note there are still some sign discrepancies between the vector
calculations and the plane polarized ones.

A. Plane-polarized stationary frame (Example only)

Note that is better to follow the (authoritative) vector stationary frame derviation (see IV B) instead. However,
his is a simpler derivation that gives a nice overview of the approach. It is superceeded by the full vectorized (and
moving-frame) derivation(s) below. I begin with the source-free Maxwell’s equations –

has the ˜G∓ terms projected out, but otherwise the two are similar in form.

3. Comments

Note the ωαrβr = ω/cf prefactors on the RHS’s – these trivially convert (ω/cr →
prefactor kr, as would be expected for this kind of spatially propagating description.
Inspection of the equations shows that even if (e.g.) G+ starts identically equal to zero, that it will pick up some
value due to the interaction of the G− components with the non-vacuum part of the permittivity. However, so as long
αr, the transfer will be slow, and because of the leading 2ıω term, G+ will rapidly oscillate. As a result, we
as αc ≪
can assume (in an appropriate limit) that any G+ contribution to the evolution of G− will spatially average to zero
in a kind of rotating wave approximation (RWA), although we should properly deﬁne criteria for “slow transfer” and
“RWA”

kr) to a wavevector

r →

ω/ωk−1

One approach that would avoid throwing away the backward propagating terms would be to describe the G+ ﬁeld
with the reverse frame transformation. Whilst this would result in some inconvenience, when simulating numerically
it could be useful in that ﬁelds propagating in the unimportant direction could be thrown away only once they had
ceased overlapping with the range covered by the pulse travelling in the important direction.

C. Plane-polarized moving frame (Example only)

NOTE: In this example calculation, the convolutions required for the nonlinearity are not explicitly included in the
notation. This does not aﬀect the result, as long as they are reinserted correctly in the ﬁnal equations.

The reference limit of the above equations (with α1 = 0; β1 = 0) when the frame is matched to the reference cf = cr
is exactly as you would expect, given that the new frame is moving in the direction of the G− component, and since
the pulse does not evolve (relative to its centre) in a vacuum, ∂z′ G− is zero (see eqn.(4.3.17)). Conversely, the G+
component is moving the opposite way to our frame at c, thus relative to the frame it moves at 2c, hence the derivative
is double that in a stationary frame (see eqn.(4.3.16)).

chosen G deﬁnition, as (I think) choosing G±
H would produce non-transverse corrections depending on

1. The medium

Consider a plane polarized ﬁeld propagating through a non-magnetic medium. I choose a stationary frame, and
a dispersionless linear reference (so αr, βr are constants). The permeability of the medium is the vacuum value µ0,
and the permittivity has three contributions: a vacuum (reference) ǫ0, a linear dispersion ǫD(t), and an instantaneous
nonlinearity ǫN L. The medium properties are therefore broken down in the following fashion –

c (ω) + ǫN L
c ˜αr + ˜ǫN L

We can see here that choosing a dispersive reference medium would modify both the dispersive correction and the
nonlinear term. Im the nonlinear case, this adds a time dependence which did not previously exist, which would
increase the computational eﬀort needed if the nonlinearity ˜ǫN L

c was instantaneous.

2. The full wave equation

This has three terms – a reference carrier-oscillation-like term (

c ), and a
nonlinear polarization term (
). The straightforward way of solving this using a split step method, where each
contribution is considered to be relatively weak, hence we solve the above in three steps. Each one integrates forward
a distance δz, but since we do one after the other (rather than doing them simultaneously), the procedure is only
accurate to ﬁrst order – but for small enough δz, the error can be assured negligible.

This will have no eﬀect if we choose the frame velocity to be the same as the phase velocity of the reference medium.
This might seem to diﬀer from the usual E ﬁeld approaches, where choosing the frame velocity to match the group
velocity gives the best cancellation of propagation terms. However, remember that the way we have chosen our
reference medium (in this example) means that group velocity corrections appear in the second RHS term as part of
˜αD
c . Choosing a frame velocity equal to the group velocity here will leave a residual reference-like term, but this can
then cancel with part of the group-velocity-like contribution from the dispersion term, which in most cases would give
the best cancellation – just as in the usual E ﬁeld approaches. If we wanted, we could easily rearrange eqn.(4.5.7) to
incorporate such a cancellation, and then solve the equation appropriately.

4. The dispersive correction

The next step is solving for the linear dispersion ˜αD

c / ˜αr in the frequency domain. Fortunately, this part of the
equation is (also) trivial to solve exactly in the frequency domain, and results in the following exponential solution –

Although both reference and dispersion steps can be solved exactly using exponentials, there is an important
diﬀerence. The reference evolution of G+ depends only on G+, whereas the dispersion evolution depends on the sum
G+ + G−, since the dispersion acts on the electric ﬁeld. In the forward-only approximation, of course, G− = 0 and
the two steps can be trivally combined – as is automagically done in most approaches solving for the propagation of
optical pulses.

5. The nonlinear correction

The ﬁnal (third) step is to transform into the time domain and solve for the n-th order nonlinear eﬀects. Since our
c = χ(n)En−1/ ˜αr, so (for a

c / ˜αr is trivial to calculate and will be just ˜αN L

For a narrow-band ﬁeld, the time derivative would be dominated by (proportional to) its centre frequency; and
indeed in most envelope theories we only see a factor of (carrier frequency) ω0 in the analogous expression. For a
wider-band ﬁeld, there would be corrections, as found for the GFEA approach [7].

In an envelope theory, the time derivative would be dominated by the carrier frequency ω0, hence we would only
see a factor of ω0 rather than the diﬀerential here. A few-cycle envelope theory would give us corrections to the ω0
prefactor. If you wanted to, the derivative used in this nonlinear step could be calculated in the spectral domain –
you’d have to FT G into the time domain, raise it to the n-th power, and FT back...

6.

Initial conditions: matching a pulse to the medium

Here I describe how to make the “best matched” initial conditions for G± describing a pulse propagating only
in the “+” direction. Note that it may be helpful to read section IX if you are confused by the use of terms like
“pseudo-reﬂection” or by the meaning of the co-propagating G− component.

The procedure is:

(1) Pick a suitable electric ﬁeld E(ω)
(2) Find out the full dispersive properties of the medium, as described by ǫi and µi. You can even put the nonlinear
or any other properities into ǫi and µi as well – but only if you will still know how get a solution for steps (3) and (5)
below with those added complications.
(3) Calculate the H(ω) corresponding to E(ω) for a “+” propagating pulse:

0 =

ǫi(ω)E(ω) +

µi(ω)H(ω)

H(ω) =

⇒

(4.5.14)

These G± initial conditions are the best guess we can make for a “+” propagating pulse in our medium.

Note that in step (3) above, I have (in eﬀect) used the deﬁnition of G± with a “reference” equal to the full dispersive
properties of the medium, and achieved a “+” propagating pulse by setting G− to zero. In the case where we intend
to use these full dispersive properties as or simulation reference, of course step (5) becomes trivial.

Because our reference ǫr, µr will not (in general) include all the dispersion ǫi(ω), µi(ω), our initial conditions will
contain both a G+ and a G− part. This initial G− part will co-propagate along with the G+, the combination being
a (hopefully) good match to the medium.

If our “full” dispersion ǫi(ω), µi(ω) are not a perfect match to the simulated medium, then there will be an initial
pseudo-reﬂection. This pseudo-reﬂection will consist of a reverse propagating G−, whose size will be equivalent to that
of the reﬂection from an interface between the dispersion used to construct the initial conditions and the simulated
medium (with ǫr + ǫc, µr + µc). Mostly this kind of pseudo-reﬂection can be eliminated with appropriate choice of
ǫi(ω), µi(ω); although nonlinear corrections will usually be impossible to treat, and so will still cause pseudo-reﬂections
– albiet hopefully very small ones.

For example, if we construct our initial conditions using a vacum ǫi(ω) = ǫ0, µi(ω) = µ0, but simulate a medium
with some refractive index n, this will be equivalent to simulating a ǫi, µi →
ǫr, µr interface. Such an interface will
cause a (pseudo) reﬂection, which will consist of a reverse propagating G−, whose size will be equivalent to that of
the reﬂection from a vacuum/n interface. A mirror image of the pseudo-reﬂection will also appear, and co-propagate
with the G+ pulse – to ensure that the tramsmitted E ﬁeld has reduced appropriately for such an interface.
Note that the “forward (co) propagating” G− component still has a Poynting vector directed backwards.

Here I do the simplest possible comparison between two diﬀerent implementations of the same physical system; and
see that (within the limits set by the approximaions) that they are identical. In the uncoupled stationary frame (G+
only) case, the wave equation with only a reference α′
0 term is

VI. FIRST ORDER EVOLUTION EQUATIONS (PRIMARY ~D)

Follows the derivation in the previous section, but uses the “Primary ~D” (or ~F ±) form, as deﬁned in III C, with

eqn. (3.5.1, 3.5.3, 3.5.5). So (dropping the tildes out of laziness)

We would do this so that the displacement ﬁeld (and magnetic ﬁelds) could be easily reconstructed from ~F ±; and,
in analogy to the THF and TEF mentioned above, we would use a transverse magnetic induction B approximation
(TBF). This this form diﬀers from the primary E form that deﬁnes G± in that it contains α−1
r α2E not
αrE; i.e. the electric-like contribution diﬀers only by ǫ/ǫr = α2/α2
r. A similar comparison holds for the magnetic
components.

r D = α−1

A. Vector stationary frame (Authoritative)

Here I avoid calculations using the x, y, and z components of the ﬁeld, and retain a fully vector description. Using

the deﬁnitions in subsection II, I can proceed with the calculation –

We see from the following VI A 1 that these two equations are suﬃcient to describe the ﬁelds as long as there is no
longitudinal ~D component (i.e. ~F ± is transverse) or longitudinal ~J (also with reference to the divergence calculation
in III E 1).

Taking the ~u

~H equation removed a part of the ﬁeld dynamics lying in the direction of the propagation
vector ~u. This part also include the response to longitudinal currents. To rectify this omission, we take the dot

VII. FIRST ORDER EVOLUTION EQUATIONS (PRIMARY ~B)

Follows the derivation in the previous sections, but uses the “Primary ~B” (or ~F ′±) form, as deﬁned in III F, with

eqns. (3.6.1, 3.6.4, 3.6.5).
NOTE: Not yet calculated, but it will have many similarities to the preceeding three derivations in sections IV, V,
VI.

VIII. THE ENERGY DENSITY AND THE POYNTING VECTOR

Here I discuss the role and calculation of the energy densities and Poynting vector for the EM ﬁeld described in
terms of the Primary ~E ( ~G±) ﬁelds. While it turns out that the THF Poynting vector is always a simple function of
the ~G± ﬁelds, the energy density is more complicated and depends on the degree of mismatch between the reference
parameters and the true material parameters. Because of this diﬃculty of reconstructing ~H from ~G±, all these
calculations currently resort to restricting themselves to the THF case only (i.e. G◦ = 0, see III C).

In practise it might well be simpler to just reconstuct the ~E and ~B ﬁelds from known ~G±, and use the traditional
forms for energy density and Poynting vector rather than evaluate the complicated expressions derived in this section.
Nevertheless, these complicated expression may provide insight into the nature of the ~G± ﬁelds, even if they a not
used for computation.

Here I will restrict mself to the non-dispersive reference case, where ǫ, µ are constants independent of frequency.
Without this, getting ~E(t) from ~G±(t) requires a deconvolution to get the frequency-dependance of ǫ, µ out of ~G±(t).
This restriction can be avoided entirely by taking the formulae below to hold in the frequency (rather than time)
domain.

We see here that the energy density takes a more complicated form if we choose to use reference parameters that
do not match the true medium ones. If the reference parameters have a diﬀerent degree of mismatch between ǫ and
µ, which will in fact normally be the case, then the cross terms dependent on ~G+

~G− do not vanish.

·

3. Full Vector Case

The energy density in the fully vectorised case can be found by retaining the

corrections removed by

the transverse approximation. Thus the non-dispersive reference energy density, as speciﬁed by eqn.(8.1.21), becomes

We will see that a G+ component always corresponds to a Poynting vector (energy ﬂux) in the +z direction, and
z). This is the basis of the assertion that these G± variable are

the G− to an ﬂux in the opposite direction (i.e.
direction, and thus correspond to forward and backward directed ﬁeld components.

X. SECOND ORDER EVOLUTION EQUATIONS

In sections IV, V, and VI I calculated various forms of ﬁrst-order propagation equation for the G± ﬁeld variables.

However, many pulse propagation theories start from a second-order form for E, as in e.g. [8],

(10.0.1)

To address this point of interest, here I follow a similar path and derive a second-order G± propagation equation.
As expected, it looks rather similar to the standard equivalents for E, but with some extra derivative (curl) terms.
First I attempt to make eqns.(3.1.6,3.1.7) look similar to eqn.(10.0.1) in subsection X A. Then in subsection X B I
present a more complete derivation of the vector form in the transverse ﬁeld case.

A. Scalar Form

This is intended as a quick, intuitive calculation to get a scalar second-order equation for G± ﬁelds. It is based
on the old Fleck[1] deﬁnitions, so I leave the linear dispersion (from the permittivity ǫ or permeability µ) inside the
polarization P rather than separate it out as an extra term (thus it contains a hidden convolution). This approach
has been superceeded (I now put everything in ǫ, µ), but this part is rather old and has not been updated accordingly.
To start, I multiply eqn.(3.1.6) by the LHS derivative term seen in eqn.(3.1.7):

It would now be straightforward to introduce a variety of useful approximations, e.g. σ
I could group the σ terms with the derivative operators in eqns.(3.1.6,3.1.7). I rearrange eqns.(3.1.6,3.1.7) to give

B. Vector Form

This is a vectorised derivation of the second order wave equation for ~G± ﬁelds. Unlike the previous scalar derivation,
it is reasonably complete and without stringent approximation (barring its transverse ﬁeld approx). The polarization
term P remains as part of the dispersion term, thus simplifying the equations; until the end when I split it oﬀ for
illustrative purposes. From section III, the unit vector in the propagation direction is ~u, and the vectorised version of
G is given by eqn.(3.3.1) –

XI. ENVELOPE PROPAGATION EQUATIONS

It is common in relatively narrowband cases to solve for the propagation of ﬁeld envelopes centred around chosen
carrier frequencies rather than the full detailed oscillations of the EM ﬁeld. In fact, if suﬃcient care is taken with
approximations, and if the system simulated is well behaved, even quite wideband pulses can be sucessfully modelled
using envelopes. The advantage of the G± wave equations presented in sections IV, V, and VI is that we dispense
with the second order form of the wave equation, and generate envelope equations from ﬁrst order equations. This
greatly reduces the number of approximations without increasing the complexity of the theory. Although a full model
requires four envelopes to describe the G±, just as a full Maxwell theory requires four envelopes, (both backward and
forward travelling E and H), this is rarely a case we are interested in solving, and so in practice we can use just one
envelope.

expansion would result in a large number of terms to consider, even for the relatively simple case of a third order

can instead use

This has the nice advantage that it eliminates and backward travelling waves, and so we can propagate pulses
eﬃciently in a moving frame. This is important, because the backward parts in a moving frame move at twice the
frame speed. In a full (non-envelope) simulation, we need to either take special eﬀorts to ﬁlter out these backward
parts, or any hoped-for numerical gains are reversed by the ﬁner z-step required to integrate (the backward parts)
accurately.

I insert envelopes using the shorthand notation Ξ = ık0z. Since αc may contain a dependence on the ﬁelds G±, I
split it using αc = ac + a∗
c . In the case of dispersion, ac = αc/2; but for a nonlinearity it will be the appropriately
carrier-matched, positive frequency part of αc, once the ﬁeld values it contains have been expanded in terms of the
envelope and carrier functions. I will proceed in the stationary frame case (ξ = 0), so

Now transform into the moving frame. Note that we will no longer want the frame to move at the phase velocity
at ω0, because that job has been taken over by the carrier; but we could use it to absorb any residual (reference)
dispersion aﬀecting one of the envelopes (most likely for G+
f ). However, it will then make the residual (reference)
dispersion term acting on the other envelope (e.g. G−

f ) twice as large. Anyway

Hawking radiation in a waveguide is produced by self-phase modulation.

Recently it was suggested that the Hawking radiation may be observed in an electromagnetic
waveguide (PRL 95, 031301 (2005)). We show that the Hawking eﬀect in a waveguide is identical
to the well-known eﬀect of frequency broadening of an optical pulse due to self-phase modulation.

In 1974 Hawking showed that black holes can evapo-
rate by emission of thermal radiation1. A closely related
eﬀect had been introduced a few years later by Unruh. He
showed that for an accelerating observer vacuum should
look like a bath of thermal radiation with temperature
TUH deﬁned as

kBTUH =

¯ha
2πc

,

(1)

where a is the acceleration of the observer2. The Hawk-
ing temperature may be obtained from this formula by
substitution of the free fall acceleration near the black
hole horizon into eq.(1). While well-established theo-
retically, these eﬀects are believed to be very diﬃcult
to observe in the experiment: an observer accelerating
at a = g = 9.8m/s2 should see vacuum temperature
of only 4 × 10−20K. Over the past years quite a few
proposals were introduced on how to emulate and/or ob-
serve the Unruh-Hawking eﬀect. A recent review of these
proposals, which involves various acoustic, optical, ac-
celerator physics, and solid state physics situations can
be found in3. Very recently it was suggested that the
Hawking radiation may potentially be observed in opti-
cal waveguides4.
In other recent proposals it was sug-
gested that the Unruh-Hawking radiation may have al-
ready been detected in the experiments with surface plas-
mon polaritons5 which propagate over a curved metal
surface6, and that the Unruh eﬀect may be emulated
in tapered optical waveguides7. However, despite large
number of diﬀerent proposals, no one has reported yet
an undisputed experimental observation of the Hawking
radiation.

In this paper we demonstrate that in the recently pro-
posed model of the Hawking eﬀect in an electromagnetic
waveguide4 the Hawking radiation may be interpreted as
the well-known eﬀect of frequency broadening of an opti-
cal pulse due to self-phase modulation. This eﬀect is well
established in ﬁber optics both theoretically and experi-
mentally. Thus, there is no need for further experimental
veriﬁcation of the Hawking radiation.

Following ref.4 and the closely related ref.8 let us con-
sider an initially monochromatic short optical pulse of
frequency ω0, which propagates along an optical ﬁber
(Fig.1). At large enough intensity I of the pulse the
refractive index of the ﬁber n is modiﬁed by the propa-
gating pulse due to the Kerr nonlinearity:

n = n0 + n2I

(2)

For the sake of simplicity let us assume that the n2
coeﬃcient does not exhibit any dependence on the fre-
quency. On the other hand,
let us assume that the
waveguide exhibits the so-called anomalous dispersion:
dn0/dω < 0 in the wide enough frequency range around
ω0. This means that at low frequencies (ω < ω0) the
speed of photons in the waveguide is smaller than the
speed of the propagating optical pulse.
In principle,
n2 > 0 and dn0/dω < 0 corresponds to the conditions
for the formation of an optical soliton in the ﬁber. How-
ever, for the sake of simplicity let us not be concerned
about the stability of the propagating optical pulse.

The situation shown in Fig.1 in the reference frame
commoving with the optical pulse replicates the picture
of two horizons for the low-frequency photons, which is
similar to the one shown in Fig.2 of ref.8: the front edge of
the optical pulse behaves as a black hole horizon for low-
frequency photons in the ﬁber, while the trailing edge
of the pulse behaves as a white hole horizon. The low
frequency photons (if any) in front of the front edge of
the pulse cannot escape it, because their speed is smaller
than the speed of the pulse. On the other hand, the low
frequency photons behind the trailing edge of the pulse
cannot reach the trailing edge. This qualitative picture
of the toy black hole and white hole horizons in an optical
ﬁber is intuitively clear. The mathematical justiﬁcation
of this picture in terms of the eﬀective metric, eﬀective
surface gravity, etc. which is experienced by the low fre-
quency photons can be found in refs.4,8. The resulting
expression for the temperature of the Hawking radiation
may be found in refs.4,7,8,9:

where the gradient of the light speed c∗ in the ﬁber
is taken at the emulated black hole horizon. In the lab-
oratory reference frame the Hawking quanta will have
frequencies in the (ω0, ω0 + ∆ω) range, where

Because of the anomalous dispersion, these quanta can
escape the horizon (their speed is faster than the speed

of the optical pulse). Using eq.(2) we can re-write eq.(4)

where we have replaced the refractive index gradient
by the time derivative of the refractive index (this is a
valid replacement since similar to ref.4 the local speed
of light variations due to the propagation of the pulse
through the waveguide depend on (x + c∗t)). The ﬁnal
result in eq.5 appears to be identical to the well-known
eﬀect of spectral broadening of an optical pulse due to
self-phase modulation.
Indeed, the eﬀect of self-phase
modulation is usually derived by considering local phase
variations across the optical pulse due to intensity de-
pendent refractive index described by eq.(2). The local
shift in frequency ∆ω(x) in the given location x in the
pulse in the reference frame comoving with the pulse is
obtained as

2

where λ0 is the wavelength of light in free space. Thus,
the spectral width of the pulse is broadened near the
leading and the trailing edges of the pulse where dI/dt
is nonzero. The spectral broadening of the pulse appears
to be the same as the one (eq.5) obtained from the esti-
mate based on the expression for the eﬀective Hawking
temperature derived in ref.4.

The eﬀect of self-phase modulation was seen in nu-
merous experiments. The more striking examples of this
eﬀect are described in refs.10,11 in which the eﬀective
Hawking temperature is very large (see ref.7) and a broad
so-called white light supercontinuum is generated while
intense femtosecond optical pulses propagate through op-
tical ﬁbers exhibiting anomalous dispersion in a wide
spectral range. Thus, we may conclude that the Hawk-
ing radiation has been already observed in numerous ﬁber
optics experiments.

ﬁber in the reference frame commoving with the intense short
optical pulse. Low frequency photons cannot escape the lead-
ing edge of the pulse, which constitutes an eﬀective black hole
horizon for low frequencies. This picture is similar to Fig.2
from ref.8.

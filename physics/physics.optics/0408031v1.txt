Abstract

We report on a high-eﬃciency 461 nm blue light conversion from an external cavity-
enhanced second-harmonic generation of a 922 nm diode laser with a quasi-phase-
matched KTP crystal (PPKTP). By choosing a long crystal (LC = 20 mm) and
twice looser focusing (w0 = 43 µm) than the ”optimal” one, thermal lensing eﬀects
due to the blue power absorption are minimized while still maintaining near-optimal
conversion eﬃciency. A stable blue power of 234 mW with a net conversion eﬃciency
of η = 75% at an input mode-matched power of 310 mW is obtained. The intra-
cavity measurements of the conversion eﬃciency and temperature tuning bandwidth
yield an accurate value d33(461 nm) = 15 (
5%) pm/V for KTP and provide a
stringent validation of some recently published linear and thermo-optic dispersion
data of KTP.

1 Introduction

Continuous-wave (CW) high-power blue light generation is a key issue for
many applications such as laser printing, RGB color display or for spectroscopy
and cooling of atomic species. Due to the limited power and tunability of gas
lasers (Ar+, HeCd) or newly developed blue diode laser sources in the blue-UV
spectrum [1], the usual procedure is to upconvert near-IR solid-state or semi-
conductor diode lasers either internal to the laser resonator [2] or in external
enhancement resonators [3,4]. In the latter scheme, the eﬃciency of the upcon-
version is usually measured in terms of the ratio η = P2ω/P in
ω of the generated
second-harmonic (SH) power to the fundamental ﬁeld (FF) power which is
mode-matched to the resonator. Several nonlinear materials can upconvert

matching. The most widely used one is the large nonlinearity (deﬀ ∼
18 pm/V)
potassium niobate (KNbO3) crystal [5,6,7,8,9]. For temperature-tuned non-
critical phase-matching, the major drawback of KNbO3 is the occurrence of
a phase transition leading to repoling near T = 185◦C [5,6], which restricts
upconversion to laser wavelengths longer than λ
920 nm. For laser cooling

width (∆T
blue-induced photo-chromic damage known as BLIIRA (Blue-Induced Infrared
Absorption [10]). This nonlinear loss mechanism, together with the associ-
ated thermal lensing, has limited the highest reported conversion eﬃciency

Alternative widely used materials are LiB3O5 (LBO) or β-BaB2O4 (BBO) [11,12,13]
but the low nonlinear coeﬃcients of oxoborate crystals (deﬀ ≤
1 pm/V) are
not suited to the frequency conversion of low power sources because it re-
quires a tight control of the round-trip intracavity loss down to
1%. Re-
cently, we employed a critically phase-matched KTP in a doubly-resonant
sum-frequency generation (SFG) of a Nd:YAG laser and a low-power AlGaAs
diode laser at 813 nm to produce 120 mW of 461 nm light, but the conversion
eﬃciency (η < 30%) was limited by the strong power imbalance of the two
pump sources [14]. To allow a more eﬃcient cooling of atomic strontium, a
new powerful and more convenient blue source from direct second-harmonic
generation (SHG) of a master-oscillator-power-ampliﬁer (AlGaAs-MOPA) de-
livering an output power of 450 mW was then constructed. But unlike in
the experiment in Ref. [9] that uses a critically phase-matched KNbO3 semi-
monolithic resonator to generate the same wavelength, we made our choice on
periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP). Electric-ﬁeld poled
quasi-phase-matched (QPM) oxide ferroelectrics such as PPLN (periodically-
poled lithium niobate) and PPKTP have recently super-seeded the previous
birefringence phase-matched materials for visible light generation [15,16,17]
owing to their much higher eﬀective nonlinearities (deﬀ(PPLN)
18 pm/V
and deﬀ(PPKTP)
9 pm/V). Furthermore QPM materials are intrinsi-
cally free of walkoﬀ. For blue generation, PPKTP is preferred to PPLN which
exhibits strong photorefractive damage when used at room-temperature. In
Ref. [15], an intra-cavity PPKTP frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser yielded an
output power of 500 mW at 473 nm with an internal eﬃciency of 5.5%. Green
light power of 117 mW was generated by Juwiler et al from 208 mW of CW
Nd:YAG laser with an eﬃciency of 56.5% in a semi-monolithic standing-wave

resonator, limited by strong thermal lensing eﬀects induced by the 532 nm
residual absorption [16]. In Ref. [17] a MOPA diode laser (0.5 W) similar to
ours generated 200 mW of blue light at 461 nm in a ring enhancement cavity,
a value comparable to that obtained using a similar semi-conductor laser, at
identical wavelength, in a semi-monolithic standing-wave KNbO3 resonator [9].

However due to the lower UV bandgap energy of KTP, linear absorption be-
comes an issue at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm. A detailed absorption mea-
surement of ﬂux-grown or hydrothermally-grown KTP in the spectral range
from the bandgap wavelength (365 nm) to 600 nm revealed a large ﬂuctuation
from sample to sample [18]. At 473 nm for instance, values of α ranging from
0.034 to 0.085 cm−1 were reported. In a recent closely-related PPKTP-SHG
experiment pumped at 846 nm, a value α(423 nm) = 0.10 cm−1 has been mea-
sured [19]. Strong thermal lensing eﬀects [20] arising from the blue absorption
was the main limitation of their power eﬃciency scaling in genuine CW op-
eration (η = 60%, corresponding to 225 mW of 423 nm power for 375mW
of mode-matched Ti:sapphire laser). Higher blue power (400 mW) could be
obtained for the same circulating power of Pc = 5.5 W only in pulsed fringe-
scanning mode that allows more eﬃcient heat dissipation within the PPKTP
crystal. Such a severe limitation in CW operation actually arised from the
tight focusing used (w0 = 17 µm, corresponding to the theoretical optimum of
the single-pass eﬃciency for the PPKTP crystal length LC = 10 mm [22,23])
and the associated thermal lens power which scales as w−2
[20]. In true CW
0
operation, the thermal focal length (which can be as short as a few cm, see
section 6) experienced by the circulating fundamental power impedes eﬃcient
mode-and-impedance matching of the input beam. For a symmetric linear res-
onator for instance, thermal lensing has been shown to be responsible for the
clamping of the circulating power to a low critical value P crit
corresponding
to the collapse of the secondary thermally-induced waists [20].

c

In the present experiment, we deliberately avoid optimal single-pass focusing
to circumvent these thermal lensing eﬀects. In section 2 we show that owing
to the large nonlinearity of PPKTP, one doesn’t require extremely low intra-
cavity linear losses to maintain the conversion eﬃciency constant over a wide
range of focusing parameters. The latter is deﬁned by L = LC/zR, where LC is
the PPKTP length and zR = kωw2
0/2 is the Rayleigh range of the cavity mode.
We ﬁnd that loose focusing to w0 = 40 µm in a 20 mm long PPKTP crystal
10−2 W−1 and
still results in a large single-pass eﬃciency Γ = P2ω/P 2
in a stable CW operation of the resonant cavity at the maximum available
mode-matched power of P in
ω = 310 mW with no evidence of serious lensing
eﬀect. Using such a strategy, blue power scaling to half a Watt should be
possible with

0.7 W of mode-matched input power.

In section 3 we brieﬂy describe the experimental setup, highlighting some
measurement procedures aimed at an accurate determination of important

parameters such as the mode-matching factor κ or the circulating power Pc.
Section 4 is devoted to the intracavity measurement of the conversion eﬃciency
that determines the ﬁnal enhancement eﬃciency, taking proﬁt of the TEM00
resonator mode ﬁltering of the fundamental MOPA laser non-Gaussian beam
and making use of the accurate evaluation of the Gaussian beam SHG focus-
ing function h [23]. From these measurements, we derive a consistent value
of the d33 nonlinear tensor element of KTP. The comparison of the recorded
temperature tuning curve with the functional dependence given by two of
the most recently published linear and thermo-optic dispersion relations of
KTP [24,25] shows a perfect agreement between theory and experiment, pro-
viding thus a stringent validation test of those dispersion relations for PPKTP
in the blue/near-IR spectrum. Having determined all the relevant parameters,
we then present (section 5) the resonant enhancement results which are in
good agreement with the theoretical expectation, with a record eﬃciency of
η = 75%. The paper ends with a brief thermal eﬀects analysis (section 6)
which supports that the experiment is indeed not limited by thermal eﬀects.

2 Analysis of singly-resonant SHG eﬃciency versus focusing

We start by investigating the dependence of the power conversion eﬃciency
on the focusing parameter L. At zero cavity detuning, the internal circulating
FF power Pc in a singly-resonant ring resonator is given by [3,26]

can note that, when diﬀraction is considered, the value of ∆k that optimizes
the focusing function h versus σ is not nil as for a plane wave [23].

The Second Harmonic absorption eﬃciency Γabs is more diﬃcult to express,
except in two limits :

for a plane wave, one can easily deduce the proﬁle P2ω(z, α2ω) for 0
from Eqs (5)-(6), and thus evaluate the absorbed power :

50 µm, meaning that it is not necessary to set

in spite of the two fold reduction of Γ for the loose focusing end range. At
wopt

P2ω = 236 mW) whereas at w0 = 50 µm, Pc = 3.4 W (P2ω = 220 mW). For

these nearly identical blue power, the thermal lens power is 4 times larger at
optimal focusing than at the looser focusing. Hence to avoid thermal eﬀects, a
cavity waist between 40 µm and 50 µm would be recommended (L
2) with
an expected eﬃciency η > 70%.

≤

This insensitivity of η as a function of w0 is due to the large nonlinear eﬃciency
which dominates round trip passive losses, even for the not so small ǫ =
0.02 chosen here. Experimentally, we indeed found that nearly optimal η was
measured over a large cavity waist values, the best trade-oﬀ giving tolerable
thermal eﬀects being at w0 = 43 µm. In the same way, the value of T1 is not
critical. Our input coupler exhibits T1 = 0.12 %, which causes a loss smaller
than 1% on the generated blue power in comparison to T opt
1 = 0.10 % which
would optimize η for w0 = 43 µm (Eq (4)).

3 Experimental setup and measurement procedures

The frequency-doubling setup is sketched in Fig. 2. A conventional unidirec-
tional ring cavity is chosen. The commercial MOPA pump laser is made of
a grating-tuned extended-cavity master diode laser in the Littrow conﬁgu-
ration, injecting a tapered semiconductor ampliﬁer (Toptica Photonics AG).
After a -70 dB Faraday isolation stage, the MOPA provides a useful single-
longitudinal-mode power Pω = 450 mW at λω = 922 nm, with a short-term
linewidth of less than 1MHz. The transverse beam shape is far from a funda-
mental Gaussian mode and strongly depends on the tapered ampliﬁer injection
current. A system of lenses mode-matches the input FF beam to the bow-tie
ring resonator larger waist located between the 2 plane mirrors M1 and M2.
The folding angle of the ring resonator is set to 11◦ leading to a negligible
astigmatism introduced by the two oﬀ-axis curved mirrors M3 and M4 (of
radius-of-curvature 100 mm). The meniscus shape of M4 (M3) do not intro-
duce any additional divergence of the transmitted FF or SH beam. This allows
5%) of the smaller waist w0 located at the cen-
an accurate measurement (to
ter of the PPKTP crystal from a z-scan measurement of the TEM00 diverging
FF beam leaking out from M4. The diverging beam diameter measurement is
performed at diﬀerent z-location by use of a rotating knife-edge commercial
device, and the cavity waist is retrieved from standard Gaussian optics laws.

±

The pump beam is coupled in through the partial reﬂector M1. Mirrors M2-
M3 are high-reﬂectors at 922nm and M4 is dichroically-coated at ω, 2ω with
Rω > 99.9% and T2ω = 98%. Side 2 of all optics are dual-band AR-coated with
R
0.5%. The dual-band AR-coated PPKTP crystal (Raicol Crystals Ltd)

polar axis. A ﬁrst-order (50%-duty-cycle) QPM periodic grating is patterned

Finally, because no suitable λ/2 plate was available in front of the cavity for the
input power variation at constant MOPA output power, Pω is varied with the
PA injection current. As mentioned previously, such a power variation results
in substantial transverse mode change and in turn in a variation of the mode-
matching factor κ. The coeﬃcient κ(Pω) was hence calibrated in the absence of
blue conversion (by tuning the temperature to a zero conversion regime) and
used to rescale the mode-matched power. For the range 300 < Pω < 450 mW,

In the following section, the conversion eﬃciency Γeﬀ(w0) (Eq. (5)) will be

power Pc, the transmissivity of mirror M4 at 922 nm was accurately calibrated
to 1.2 10−5
10%. The FF and the SH powers were calibrated with a thermal
powermeter with an uncertainty below 5 %.

those measured elsewhere (5-8 pm/V) from OPO threshold measurement or
diﬀerence frequency generation [24,29], even when wavelength dispersion is ac-
counted for. This value yields for KTP d33(461nm) = 15 (
5%) pm/V, which
is the commonly reported value of this polar χ(2) tensor element [29,30,31] and
matches exactly the value (14.8 pm/V) reported by the manufacturer [32]. This

lieve that the perfect match of deﬀ with its maximum theoretical value stems
from the pure Gaussian beam measurement and analysis taking diﬀraction
and absorption eﬀects into account, which is not always the case with some
of the reported lower values even accounting for grating periodicity defects.

We have tried tight focusing close to the optimal waist shown in Fig. 3 with-
out any improvement in the singly-resonant conversion eﬃciency, despite the
larger Γeﬀ, conﬁrming the prediction of Section 2. At w0 = 36 µm, the con-
version eﬃciency is identical to the one at 43 µm. As expected, increasing
thermal eﬀects occurred with smaller waists, which could be assessed from a
broadened triangular bistable shape of the FF and blue fringes as the cavity
length is swept on the contracting length side of the voltage ramp (see e.g.
Fig. 10 of Ref. [19] and the thermal eﬀects analysis in Section 6). On this
side of the fringe, passive self-stabilization of the optical path length of the
resonator tends to maintain the cavity in resonance with the incoming FF
frequency. Such an opto-thermal dynamics of thermally-loaded resonators has
been analyzed in detail in Ref. [20]. Furthermore, the active locking of the
cavity to the top of the distorted fringe - a bistable operating point [20] -
becomes problematic as reported in Ref. [19].

The temperature tuning curve measured internal to the cavity is also shown in
Fig. 4 for the ﬁnal waist choice of w0 = 43 µm, corresponding to L = 1.73. The
oscillatory ﬁne structure pattern at the wings is clearly seen. The solid line
is the conversion eﬃciency computed from Eqs.(5)-(7), where the wavevec-
tor mismatches ∆k(T ) have been computed with the Sellmeier relations at
room-temperature given in Ref. [24], the thermo-optic dispersion relation of

Ref. [25] and the thermal expansion coeﬃcient αX = 6.8
in Ref. [28]. Given the short grating period, a strikingly excellent agreement
is seen with the data points (sidelobe amplitudes and positions) when the
h(σ) focusing function is used instead of the plane-wave formula. Apart from
a lateral temperature shift of the calculated tuning curve in Fig. 4, we stress
again that no ﬁt was made to get such an agreement, which not only pro-
vides a stringent validation of the used dispersion data, at least for PPKTP
produced by our manufacturer, but also highlights the excellent quality of
the ﬁrst-order periodic grating over the whole PPKTP length. The FWHM
temperature tuning bandwidth is ∆T = 1.1◦C.

5 Resonant enhancement eﬃciency

The ﬁnal cavity dimensions yielding the least thermal eﬀects while providing
the best power conversion eﬃciency when the cavity length is servo-controlled
correspond to cavity waists (w0, w1) = (43 µm,163 µm) given by a M3-M4
130 mm and a total ring cavity round-trip length Lcav = 569 mm.
spacing of
For genuine CW stable operation, an active electronic servo based on an
FM-to-AM fringe modulation technique was preferred to the optically phase-
sensitive H¨ansch-Couillaud method that was reported to fail when thermal
eﬀects arise [8,19].

∼

The round-trip intracavity fractional loss ǫ is measured by ﬁtting, at the QPM
temperature, the total losses p = ǫ + Γ Pc of the cavity as a function of Pc.
Otherwise, p is related to the contrast C of the cavity reﬂection fringes :

p =

C Pω
Pc

(10)

This relationship is very reliable since it doesn’t depend on the mode matching
coeﬃcient κ. The ﬁt yields ǫ = 0.021 (
5%), which is further checked from
the value of the cavity ﬁnesse
40 in the absence of nonlinear conversion.
This also gives a measurement of Γ which is consistent with the value quoted
above.

When the cavity is close to impedance matching, the reﬂection contrast be-
comes nearly constant and is then equal to the mode matching coeﬃcient, we
measured κ (P max
) = 73 %. For intermediate values of the pump power, the
evaluation is more diﬃcult : κ can be deduced from the contrast of reﬂected
fringes at zero conversion, once ǫ is known.

6 Blue-induced thermal eﬀects analysis

The inset of Fig. 6 shows a slight fringe asymmetry observed on both the
FF and SH fringes, reminiscent of the onset of thermal bistability. On the
contracting cavity length scan (solid line), the fringe is broadened because the
opto-thermal dynamics on this side is characterized by a self-stabilizing eﬀect
of the optical path to the laser frequency whereas on the expanding length
side (dotted curve) the feedback is positive [20]. In the PPKTP experiment of
Ref. [19], the thermal eﬀects were so prominent that the fringe shape broadens
over several cold cavity linewidths to acquire a triangular shape. In our case,
the broadening is comparatively very modest. It is expected that heating is
due to both the residual FF absorption and the SH absorption. To quantify
further the role of residual thermal eﬀects, we use the radial heat diﬀusion
model detailed in Ref. [20], assuming an equivalent crystal rod radius equal to
the half-thickness of the PPKTP (r0 = 0.5 mm). The temperature rise due to

For Pc = 3.25 W, one ﬁnds ∆T0 = 0.14◦C, and fth = 65 mm. Such a short
focal length means that signiﬁcant FF lensing still occurs despite the looser
focusing used and the small value of FF absorption coeﬃcient. Only a rigorous
hot ring cavity waist analysis, similar to the one developed for a standing-wave
symmetric resonator in Ref. [20], can give an indication on the inﬂuence of
this thermal lens on the cold cavity waist. For a symmetric resonator, the
length must be reduced to the minimum allowed space in order to contain the
thermal lens eﬀect. Due to ∆T0, the FF hot fringe is shifted from the cold

To evaluate the heating due to the SH absorbed power, Eq. (11)-(12) cannot
be used as they are, because the blue power is not uniform along the crystal
(P2ω = 0 at z = 0 and is maximum at z = Lc). It is however possible to
estimate the total blue absorbed power P abs
from Eq. (8), which
2ω = 25 mW, and Γabs = 2.4 10−3 W −1. This heating power can be

From the analysis, the weak thermal dynamics is mainly ruled by the SH
absorption. No bistability is observed meaning that these thermal eﬀects do
not aﬀect the measured conversion eﬃciency, contrary to the case of Ref. [19]
where the fringe shift amounts to > 15γ, giving a broad triangular shape
and a sharp spike on the expanding-length scan. Indeed, considering a shorter

For this tighter focusing case, the corresponding blue fringe shape plotted
in Fig. 8 displays a bistable shape. On the contracting-length direction (to
the right) a fringe broadening by ∆ + Θ = 5.8 (in unit of γ) is evidenced.
On the expanding-length direction (to the left), the opto-thermal feedback
is positive. Once the upper intensity branch is reached, instead of following
it back adiabatically as yielded by the stationary calculation, a sharp fringe
results as sketched by the dotted line.

PPKTP frequency doubler. The key ingredient for such a high eﬃciency is
the use of a long crystal length allowing to relax the focusing parameter to
a level where thermal eﬀects due to the strong blue absorption (temperature
mismatch and lensing eﬀects) don’t prevent from a CW operation at maximum
power. No cavity locking issue for stable CW were encountered at maximum
laser power. The long nonlinear interaction length results in a large single-pass
conversion eﬃciency that relaxes the constraint of having vanishing round-trip
linear loss.

Finally, by measuring the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient internal to the ring cav-
ity, we have additionally provided an accurate determination of the d33(461 nm) =
15
(5%) pm/V nonlinear tensor element of KTP from exact Gaussian beam
SHG theory accounting for absorption by the crystal. The high-quality of the
ﬁrst-order QPM grating of our sample was also checked from the perfect agree-
ment of the measured phase-matching temperature bandwidth with a set of
published Sellmeier equations and thermo-optic dispersion relations of KTP.

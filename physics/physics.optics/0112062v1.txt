Abstract

The boundary problem of linear classical optics about the interaction of electromag-
netic radiation with a thin dielectric ﬁlm has been solved under explicit consideration of its
discrete structure. The main attention has been paid to the investigation of the near-zone
optical response of dielectrics. The laws of reﬂection and refraction for discrete structures
in the case of a regular atomic distribution are studied and the structure of evanescent
harmonics induced by an external plane wave near the surface is investigated in details.
It is shown by means of analytical and numerical calculations that due to the existence of
the evanescent harmonics the laws of reﬂection and refraction at the distances from the
surface less than two interatomic distances are principally diﬀerent from the Fresnel laws.
From the practical point of view the results of this work might be useful for the near-ﬁeld
optical microscopy of ultrahigh resolution.

Introduction

Usually in the investigations of optical phenomena in dielectrics a medium is considered as
a continuous system of radiators. Besides the macroscopic Maxwell equations are employed.
This way of description works well if one considers the phenomena which take place at large
enough distances from medium interfaces. However, in recent years the interest to the optical
phenomena near the surfaces of diﬀerent media at the distances much less than the radiation
wavelength has dramatically increased. Beside a purely fundamental interest this is connected
to the vigorous development of the scanning near-ﬁeld optical microscopy [1]-[7]. There were
developed various schemes of optical near-ﬁeld microscopes and the work in this direction is still
currently underway. However, all the schemes have a common feature, namely, the measurement

1

of the optical response of the medium on the external radiation is carried out in the near zone
at the distances of the order of surface inhomogenity [4, 7].

The resolution obtained with the aid of near-ﬁeld optical microscopes permanently increases
and at the moment it is of the order of 10 nm. Besides the probe scans the surface also at
the distance of the order of 10 nm [7]. At such a small distance it becomes necessary to take
into account the discrete structure of the medium. The attempts of consideration of discrete
medium structure in the theoretical description of the near-ﬁeld optical measurements have been
undertaken in recent years [4]. However, the main attention has been paid to the situations
when discrete dipoles model rather large surface inhomogenities and the spatial distribution of
these dipoles is asymmetric. The progress in the near-ﬁeld optical microscopy allows one to hope
that there will be possible to observe the atomic structure of surfaces. Then it will be necessary
to interpret the optical response from single atoms more or less regularly distributed on the
surfaces. Similar problems occur when one wants to describe the near-ﬁeld in the vicinity of
the surfaces of photon [8] and plasmon [9] crystals. Besides it becomes more natural to employ
microscopic equations.

Intensive studies on optics of discrete dielectric media have been started not very long time
ago. The laws of refraction and reﬂection for discrete structures were shown to be diﬀerent
from Fresnel laws [10] and this leads to the anomalies in the behavior of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld near the surface [11]-[13]. Theorem of extinction for discrete structures has been derived
and the corrections to the Snell law were worked out [14]. The characteristic features of the
spontaneous emission process [15, 16], superradiation [17] and optical bistability [18] in discrete
structures were investigated. The second harmonic generation in discrete structures has been
considered in Ref. [19], where a good agreement with experimental data has been pointed out.
It was also shown that the consideration of the discrete structure of the medium leads to the
surface local-ﬁeld eﬀect [20] and surface induced optical anisotropy [21]-[24].

Properties of the waves reﬂected from discrete structures in the wave and near zones have
been studied as well.
It has been shown that in the wave zone the reﬂected waves can be
described by plane waves [10, 11, 25, 26, 27]. However, the treatment in Refs. [25, 26, 27] does
not take into account evanescent harmonics which give a considerable contribution into optical
response of discrete dielectric structures in the near zone. These evanescent harmonics are not
related to the total internal reﬂection and they exist even in the case of a single atom [28]. Due
to the neglect of the evanescent harmonics the method developed in Refs. [25, 26, 27] can be
employed for the description of the optical response of a thick enough medium in the wave zone
only.

A more general approach which implicitly takes into account the evanescent harmonics has
been developed in Refs. [10, 11]. This allowed us to show that the ﬁelds of the reﬂected waves
in the near zone are periodic functions of longitudinal coordinates with the period equal to
the lattice constant. This result conﬁrms the assumption put forward in Ref. [7] that with
the aid of near-ﬁeld optical microscopes one can observe the atomic structure of the medium
In the present paper we shall continue the investigations started in Refs. [10, 11].
surface.
Employing the methods of the calculation of the lattice sums developed in Refs. [12, 24] we
are going to investigate in more details the behavior of evanescent harmonics near the surface
of a dielectric ﬁlm with an ideal crystal structure. We would like to note that the role of the
evanescent harmonics in the near-zone optical response of dielectrics has been point out by
Sivukhin [29]. On the basis of rather simple and intuitive physical arguments he came to the
qualitative conclusion that the Fresnel laws of reﬂection and refraction have to be violated at
the distances from the surface less than one interatomic distance. In the present paper we are

2

going to undertake a quantitative analysis of this fundamental issue. Besides it will be shown
that the existence of the evanescent harmonics leads to principal deviations from Fresnel laws
of reﬂection and refraction at the distances from the surface of the order of few interatomic
distances.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we shall discuss the problem we are going
to solve and the main equations which constitute the basis of the microscopic approach to the
description of optical phenomena in the linear classical optics. Section 3 is devoted to the
analyses of the probe inﬂuence on the electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution in the ﬁlm and the
back inﬂuence of the perturbation caused by the probe on the ﬁeld magnitude on it.
It is
shown that in some cases the probe inﬂuence can be neglected. In section 4 we shall calculate
the distribution of the local ﬁeld in a dielectric ﬁlm under the incidence of a plane wave. In
section 5 we shall analyze in details the characteristic features in the behavior of reﬂected and
transmitted waves in the wave and near zones.

Statement of the problem and basic equations

−

Let a monochromatic light wave with frequency ω and electric ﬁeld strength vector EI(r, t) =
AI(r) exp (
iωt) be incident on a dielectric ﬁlm with thickness h. Above the ﬁlm there is a
probe which measures the electromagnetic ﬁeld at a certain point of space. The probe will be
treated as a single point-like dipole with a linear polarizability αp. Such a scheme can be realized
in a real experiment using either a single atom in a magneto-optical trap [30] or an admixed
atom implanted in the needle of a near-ﬁeld microscope [7, 31]. Our aim is to investigate
the behavior of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the ﬁlm and to calculate the characteristics of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld on the probe that is moved (scanned) along the ﬁlm surface at some ﬁxed
distance d. The ﬁeld detection, which represents itself a separate problem, will not be touched
in the present paper.

We shall treat the dielectric ﬁlm as a system of N monolayers located at a distance a from one
another. The atoms inside the monolayers possess a discrete spatial distribution. In a stationary
case the equation for the local electric ﬁeld strength on the probe E′

The reference frame is chosen in such a manner that z axis is perpendicular to the ﬁlm surface.
The second term on the r.h.s. of eq.(1) describes the Lorentz radiation damping [32, 34].
In spite of the fact that the radiation damping makes usually a small contribution into the
resultant ﬁeld the consideration of this term is of principal signiﬁcance. If one does not take it
into account the energy conservation is violated (see [35] and references therein).

The physical meaning of the ﬁelds E0
l is the local ﬁeld inside the
ﬁlm without consideration of the contribution made by the probe. This contribution is taken
into account by means of the ﬁeld Ep
l . Thus, for the solution of the problem stated above it is
necessary ﬁrst to solve the unperturbed problem (5). Then using the obtained solution one can
determine the perturbation of the ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm caused by the probe and calculate the
back inﬂuence of this perturbation on the ﬁeld at the position of the probe (6), (7). However,
before dealing with this general problem we shall estimate the perturbation in the ﬁlm caused
by the probe and ﬁnd out under which conditions it is considerable.

Estimate of the perturbation caused by the probe

In this section we shall estimate Ep
l which enters eqs.(6), (7). For that purpose one can neglect
radiation damping terms in eqs.(6), (7). Our starting point is the following. The perturbation

4

of the ﬁeld in the medium Ep
l , which is caused by the probe, decreases rapidly with the increase
of the distance between the surface and the probe. If in addition we take into account that the
inﬂuence of atoms on one another also rapidly decreases with the distance, one can come to the
conclusion that either the probe or the nearby atoms will be inﬂuenced mainly by the atoms
located in the nearest vicinity around them. Thus, it is necessary to ﬁnd the ﬁeld Ep(ra) in
the direct vicinity of the probe. Let’s estimate ﬁrst the size of this region.

One can assume that the behavior of the ﬁeld Ep

l has the same features as that induced by

the probe

Taking into account that the ﬁeld on the probe is deﬁned by the atoms in the near zone, one can
keep in eq.(8) only the terms proportional to R−3
al . We substitute the corresponding expression
into (7) and replace the summation by integration. As a result of this the expression for the
third term in the r.h.s. of (7) takes the form

with ρ being the macroscopic concentration of atoms. The integration in (9) is carried out over
the ﬁlm volume limited by the external surface Σ. In order to prevent the interaction of the
atom with itself a small region limited by the spherical surface Σσ centered at the observation
point has to be excluded from the integration. The size σ of this small region is of the order of
lattice constant. In Ref. [10] it was shown that in order to achieve the complete correspondence
passing from discrete to continuous atomic distribution one has to put σ = 3

Let’s determine the region of space, atoms from which make the main contribution to the
ﬁeld on the atom nearest to to the probe. Let δ be a tolerance of the calculations of the dipole

Integration in the denominator and in the numerator in eq.(10) is carried out over the ﬁlm
volume and over the spherical segment with the radius L centered at the position of the atom
nearest to the probe, respectively. Taking into account (8) we obtain from eq.(10) the following
estimate for the radius of the sphere L within which it is necessary to calculate the ﬁelds on
the atoms:

Let δ = 0.1%, then L

L, because in eq.(7) there is also the ﬁeld induced by the probe and compared to this ﬁeld
the inﬂuence of the remote atoms is less. The conclusion that only the neighboring atoms
contribute to the ﬁeld at the site of probe in near-ﬁeld regime is in agreement with the results
of Ref. [36], where the inﬂuence on the probe caused by microscopic dielectric spheres located
at the surface has been calculated. It was shown that the lattice of 5
5 spheres makes the
main contribution. The increase of this area does not inﬂuence the ﬁnal result.

×

Performing analogous calculations for eq.(6) we obtain that the main contribution to the
ﬁeld on the probe is made by the atoms located inside the sphere with the radius L centered
at the probe position. Thus, the system of equations (6), (7) is reduced to the system of few
linear algebraic equations, which can be solved numerically after the ﬁeld E0
l is obtained from
eq.(5). However, as it will be shown below in many situations it is even not necessary to solve
this system of equations due to the negligible contribution of Ep.

For the sake of distinctness we assume the probe to be located above some surface atom
of the ﬁlm. The ﬁeld induced by the probe at the position of this atom is determined by the
expression

Eef f ≈ −

αpEp/d3,

(12)

where d is the distance between the probe and the atom. In formula (12) we have neglected
the retardation and the ﬁeld on the probe is chosen to be polarized parallel to the ﬁlm surface
assuming that the variations of the direction of the polarization vector does not inﬂuence much
the ﬁnal results. It has been shown above that in the calculations of the ﬁeld on the probe it
is enough to take into account the atoms located inside the sphere with the radius L. The rest
of the ﬁlm does not inﬂuence much the probe. So we shall estimate the inﬂuence on the probe,
caused by the atoms located within the spherical segment centered at the position of the atom
below the probe. Obviously, the microscopic ﬁeld amplitude on the atom under consideration
is larger than that on the other atoms of the ﬁlm. The upper estimate of the ﬁeld amplitude
at the position of this atom Emax is given by

Emax| ≤ |

Eef f |

[1

1.71C ln(L/σ)]−1 ,

|

−
where the dimensionless parameter C = αρ is a volumic polarizability [27]. We shall assume
that the ﬁeld on any atom inside the spherical segment is constant and equal to the ﬁeld on the
central atom Emax. It is obvious that in this approximation the inﬂuence on the probe caused
by the spherical segment is larger than it is. Our calculations are approximate, so we replace
the summation by the integration. Calculating the ﬁeld at the position of the probe we get an
upper estimate of the last term in the r.h.s. of eq.(6)

(13)

Taking into account (12), (13), (14), we get a condition under which one can neglect this term:

Note that the condition (15) does not depend on the way of excitation of the surface atoms. It
remains the same if the atoms are excited by a wave incident from the side of the probe, by an
evanescent wave, or by the wave radiated by the probe itself.

In eq.(15) ln(L/d + 1) and ln(L/σ) are of the order of unity. Therefore, one can rewrite (15)

in a simpler form

Usually for dielectric media C
10 at the distances from the surface equal
to one lattice constant. Therefore, inequality (16) is satisﬁed at the distances equal or greater
than one lattice constant.

At the distances between the probe and the surface such that the inﬂuence of discrete atomic
distribution is negligible but the retardation is still important the calculation of the ﬁeld on the
probe reduces to the electrostatic problem of the calculation of the dipole ﬁeld near a dielectric
surface. For the ﬁeld Eef f

The condition (19) is in a good agreement with (16), albeit the former imposes less strict
limitations on d.

Thus, at the distances between the probe and the surface of the order of one lattice constant
the back inﬂuence of the ﬁlm on the probe can be safely neglected. In this approximation the
ﬁeld on the probe is determined by the ﬁeld of the external wave and the ﬁeld E0
l . The problem
of calculation of the ﬁeld E0

l will be discussed in the next section.

4 Distribution of the ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm (solution of

the unperturbed problem)

Let the external wave be a plane one, i.e.,

AI(r) = E0I exp(ik0r), k0 = k0(sin ΘI cos ΦI, sin ΘI sin ΦI ,

cos ΘI) ,

(20)

−

where ΘI is an incident angle and the azimuthal angle ΦI deﬁnes the orientation of the incidence
plane.

The atoms of the monolayers are assumed to form a regular periodic structure with elemen-

tary translations vectors a1 and a2. Without loss of generality one can put

a1 = ak(1, 0, 0),

a2 = ak(α, β, 0).

For the sake of simplicity the vectors a1 and a2 are assumed to be the same for all monolayers.
The generalization on diﬀerent a1 and a2 for diﬀerent monolayers can be easily done. In these
notations the radius-vector of some atom in the j-th monolayer has the form

where m and n are integer. The vector r0

j has the following form

raj = r0

j + amn = r0

Nonvanishing α1j and α2j take into account possible parallel shifts of the atomic planes relative
to one another.

Making use of the principle of parallel translational symmetry the solution for the local ﬁeld

in the l-th monolayer can be written down in the form [12, 13, 20, 22, 24]:

(cid:17)

(24)

We substitute (20), (24) into (5). Now it is necessary to calculate the lattice sums in eq.(5).
Due to the slow convergence of lattice sums their direct calculation is a very laborious and
in fact impracticable computational problem.
In order to compute them one can use “the
Lorentz method” according to which the atoms located near the observation point are treated
as discretely distributed and the atoms outside a ﬁctitious boundary are treated as continuously
distributed. This method can be employed either for well-ordered or for random media and for
the observation points either inside or outside of the media. This way of computation has been
employed in various modiﬁcations in Refs. [10, 11, 20, 37, 38]. On the other hand, if the atomic
distribution in the monolayers is regular, this separation of discrete and continuous regions is
not necessary anymore. In this case there exist another way of computation of the lattice sums
which is rapidly convergent and more convenient for the interpretation of the ﬁeld behavior
near the surface [12, 24]. It is this latter way will be employed in the present paper.

If the observation point is located not in the monolayer over which the summation is carried
out (j
= l) the lattice sums can be converted to the form which is more appropriate for numerical
calculations, making use of the formula for the dipole ﬁeld induced by the j-th monolayer at
some point r, which has been obtained in Ref. [24] by means of Fourier transform (Ewald’s
three-fold integral transform):

The choice of the vectors a1 and a2 can be arbitrary. However, it makes sense to choose them

Formula (25) is a useful representation of the lattice sums for numerical calculations because

= 0, i.e. the evanescent harmonics, are periodic

functions of x and y and they posses the following property of the translational symmetry

Apq(r + ma1 + na2, zj) = Apq(r, zj) .

(29)

As we shall see further on, this property of the evanescent harmonics leads to the fact that the
intensities of the reﬂected and transmitted waves near the ﬁlm surface are periodic functions
of x and y.

If the observation point r is at the position of some atom inside the monolayer over which
the summation is carried out (j = l), then for the calculation of the lattice sum it is convenient
to employ the method based on Ewald’s onefold integral transform [12]. Separating the initial
sum over the real lattice on the sums over the real and reciprocal lattices one gets the following

The rate of convergence of the sums in (31) is determined by the parameter E, which has a
dimension of the inverse length. It appears as a result of the formal separation of the initial sum
over the real lattice on the sums over the real and reciprocal lattices. This parameter has no any
physical meaning, it must be only real and positive and its choice can be arbitrary [12]. However,
it makes sense to choose the parameter E in such a manner that the rates of convergence for
the sums over (p, q) and (m, n) are the same. One can show that this requirement is fulﬁlled,
a2|
provided that E =
. Substituting this value into (31) one can estimate the maximal
values of (n, m) and (p, q) which has to be taken for the calculation of the lattice sums with
x2)/(x√π), we get the
the tolerance ε. Taking into account that at large x erfc(x)

Exact numerical calculations for a square lattice show that if the summation is restricted by
the terms with n, m, p, q = 0,
1 the relative tolerance of the calculations of the dipole ﬁeld is
about 10−6, which is in a good agreement with the estimate (32). Therefore, our choice of the
parameter E appears to be very convenient for carring out numerical calculations.

The results of numerical solution of the system of equations (33) for the cubic lattice and
s-polarized incident wave are shown in Fig. 1. In order to demonstrate to the fullest extent the
characteristic features of the ﬁeld behavior near the ﬁlm surface we have used a rather high value
of the volumic polarizability (C = 0.2). Normally in the optical range C = 0.04

which corresponds to CGaP = 0.19 and CSi = 0.2, respectively.

As it follows from the numerical calculations, the consideration of the discrete structure
inﬂuences the most signiﬁcantly the behavior of the ﬁeld amplitude near the ﬁlm surface where
rapid oscillations of the local ﬁeld take place. The amplitude of these oscillations and the
penetration depth into the ﬁlm volume increase with the parameter C. One can also see on
Fig. 1 that the consideration of the discrete structure does not inﬂuence much the phase of the
ﬁeld. This means that the wave vector of the ﬁeld remains almost the same at any point inside
the ﬁlm. Therefore, the real part of the refractive index of the ﬁeld is constant. Far from the
boundaries the distribution of the ﬁeld is regular and approximately coincides the results given
by the Airy formulae.

The discrepancy between the values of the ﬁeld of the reﬂected wave calculated under
consideration of the discrete structure and according to the Airy formulae can be of the order
of 10%. This discrepancy becomes larger with the decrease of the ﬁlm thickness and with
the increase of the parameter C (Fig. 2). The plots on Fig. 2 lead to the conclusion that at
high enough ﬁlm thicknesses (N
20) the Airy formulae give a satisfactory description of the
reﬂected waves in the wave zone. In this situation our method of calculation becomes equivalent
to that developed in Refs. [25, 26, 27]. As for the dependence on the incident angle, the maximal
discrepancy between the amplitudes of the reﬂected wave calculated under consideration and
without consideration of the discrete structure is observed at normal incidence. With the
increase of the incident angle this discrepancy gradually vanishes (Fig. 3). In the calculations
presented on Figs. 2,3 we used the Airy formulae for the case when the ﬁlm occupies the region

At a small distance from the surface the summands with p, q

The ratio of the amplitudes of the evanescent harmonics Eκ for κ = 0 (plane reﬂected wave),

on the distance between the probe and the ﬁlm surface. The behavior shown on Fig. 4 is
typical for the distances greater or equal to one lattice constant. Usually if one takes into
account the modes with p, q = 0,
2 the tolerance of the calculations is less than one
per cent. As it follows from the dependences on Fig. 4, at k0a = π (a typical value for
photonic crystals and optical lattices) the monolayers do not ﬁll the evanescent waves radiated
by the other monolayers. At z = 2a and k0a = 0.005 the ratio of decaying and non-decaying

ﬁeld components is about 1% and rapidly decreases with the increase of k0a.

the dependence shown on Fig. 6 it follows that the contribution of the evanescent component is
essential at the distances less than two lattice constants. The ﬁeld radiated by the monolayers,

The distance Le can be also analytically estimated on the basis of the following consider-

5.2.2 Non-transversality of the total ﬁelds of reﬂected and transmitted waves

In distinction to the wave zone the polarization vector of the ﬁeld in the near zone has no a deﬁ-
nite direction. Its magnitude and the direction depend on all three spatial coordinates. Indeed,
the polarization vector of a certain evanescent harmonic in the r.h.s of eq.(37) is perpendicular
to the wave vector kpq, which in its turn has diﬀerent orientations depending on p and q. In
addition, each harmonic has its own decay coeﬃcient κpq and the behavior of the harmonic
along the surface is deﬁned by its own vector gk
pq. Carrying out the summation over all the
harmonics we get the properties of the polarization vector mentioned above. In particular, in
the case of the normal incidence of the external wave with the polarization vector along the y
axis the ﬁeld near the ﬁlm surface has non-vanishing x- and z-components (Fig. 7a,c).

For the purposes of the further analysis let’s estimate the ratio of the evanescent com-

the s-polarization it follows that in the case of ultrathin ﬁlm the local ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm

Thus, the amplitude of the evanescent wave at the distance from the surface of the order of
one lattice constant is usually much less than the incident ﬁeld amplitude. Therefore, one can
conclude that in the ﬁeld of the probe the main contribution is made by the component of the
ﬁeld directed along the polarization vector of the external wave. In particular, comparing the
intensities of x and z-components of the ﬁeld (Fig. 7a,c) with y-component (Fig. 7b) one can
notice that the contribution of x- and z-components is small and the ﬁeld behavior near the
surface is mainly determined by y-component.

One can come to one more conclusion regarding the direction of the ﬁeld polarization vector
near the ﬁlm surface. Under the normal incidence of the external wave in the case when there
are no parallel shifts of the atomic planes relative to one another, i.e., α1j = α2j = 0, j = 1, N,
at the observation points above the atoms the z-component of the reﬂected wave ﬁeld vanishes

harmonics with equal κpq (κpq = κ−p,−q), we get that (E0

5.2.3 Dependence of ﬁeld intensity on the longitudinal coordinates x and y

The electromagnetic ﬁeld intensity is deﬁned by its strength squared. In a general case it can be
calculated numerically. But in the case of the normal incidence (ΘI = 0) one can obtain rather
simple analytical expressions. Let’s consider this case. From the plots on Fig. 6 it follows
that the component of the ﬁeld, which is a periodic function of longitudinal coordinates, is
induced mainly by the surface atoms. The bulk atoms produce only a constant background.
Thus, in order to analyze the behavior of the evanescent waves it is enough to consider only
one surface monolayer (zj = 0 in eq.(37)). For the qualitative analysis of the ﬁeld behavior
near the ﬁlm surface it is enough to keep in eq.(37) only the harmonics with (p, q) = (1, 0),

that two times). The amplitudes of all other harmonics are at least one order of magnitude
less [42]. Omitting the unimportant constant factor after an elementary algebra we obtain an
approximate expression for the ﬁeld intensity at the probe position:

which is valid for the ﬁlms of arbitrary thickness. Here E0
1 is an amplitude of the unperturbed
part of the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst (surface) monolayer. In fact, this expression is the second power
of the real part of the ﬁeld component at the probe position, directed along the polarization
vector of the external ﬁeld. The imaginary part of this component and all other components
are negligible.

From the expression (45) one can see that in general the intensity minima and maxima
are shifted relative to the atomic positions. This is due to the term which contains E0
1z. Due
to the fact that even in the case of the normal incidence the dependence of the direction
of the vector E0
1 on the direction of E0I is rather complicated, the location of the intensity
minima and maxima depends on E0I in a complicated manner as well. Let’s consider the
case when there are no parallel shifts of the atomic planes relative to one another. As it was
shown above, in this case E0
1z = 0 and the expression (45) becomes simpler. In this case the
intensity minima are located exactly at the positions of the atoms.
Indeed, at these points

cos[g1(r

In analogous manner one could assume that the intensity maxima are located in the centers
of the elementary cells, where the cosines are equal to
1. However, this is not exactly the
case as one can see on Fig. 8. With the change of the mutual orientation of the polarization
vector of the external wave and the lattice elementary translations vectors the location of the
intensity maxima changes as well. The reason is the following. Let the polarization vector of
the external wave is perpendicular to one of the vectors of the reciprocal lattice, for instance,
(E0Ig1) = 0. The ﬁeld behavior along the direction a1 in this case is determined by higher
order harmonics with the smallest decay coeﬃcient and with non-vanishing component along

observation points above the atoms (rk = rk
a1) this term is minimal, i.e., the intensity minima
are still above the atoms, even provided that (E0Ig1) = 0 or (E0
1g1) = 0. The locations of the
intensity maxima can be found from the condition (gmin
11 r) = π
2πk, where k is an integer.
This condition fulﬁlls not in the centers of the elementary cells, like in the case when the
directions of the polarization vector of the external wave E0I and the local ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm
E0
1 does not coincide with any of the translation vectors of the lattice (Fig. 8b,c), but at the
points rk = rk
a1 + a2/2 (Fig. 8a). Thus, in distinction to the intensity minima
locations, which are always above the atoms, the locations of the intensity maxima depend on
the mutual orientation of the ﬁeld polarization and the translation vectors of the lattice.

Formula (45) allows one to investigate the image contrast, which is deﬁned here as a maximal
diﬀerence of the light intensity along a certain direction.
In Refs. [4, 36, 44] it was point
out that the ﬁeld component parallel to the scan direction displays a better contrast than
that perpendicular to this direction. Let’s consider this problem in more details. The image
contrast in the direction ai is determined by the mutual orientation of the vectors E0I, E0
1, and
gi. The maximal contrast is reached at some angle between E0I and gi when the coeﬃcient
(giE0I)Re(giE0
1) takes the largest value. This angle depends in general on the symmetry of the
atomic distribution at the surface and on the atomic polarizability. We are going to come back
to this issue in our subsequent publications.

The minimal contrast along the direction a1 for the lines which pass through the atoms
is achieved when the polarization vector of the external wave or the ﬁeld vector in the ﬁlm
is perpendicular to the vector of the reciprocal lattice g1 (parallel to the vector of the real
lattice a2) (45). Performing numerical calculations, one can show that in general the conditions
(giE0I) = 0 and (giE0
1) = 0 are satisﬁed at diﬀerent directions of the polarization vector of
the external wave. Thus, in general there exist two angles at which contrast minima can be
observed. The angle between the two directions of the polarization vector of the external ﬁeld
allows one to get the information about the local ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm and, therefore, about the
atomic polarizability.

Another situation occurs for the contrast along the lines which pass through the centers
of the elementary cells. In this case the contrast minima are determined by the condition of
mutual compensation of the contributions from the harmonics with decay coeﬃcients g1 and
gmin
11 . The compensation occurs at some angle φc between the polarization vector of the ﬁeld
inside the ﬁlm and the vector g1, which depends on the symmetry of the atomic distribution
at the surface. The angle φc strongly depends on the distance from the surface.

Let’s consider the simplest case of the cubic lattice. Under the normal incidence of the
external wave the direction of the polarization vector of the ﬁeld inside the ﬁlm coincides with
that of the external ﬁeld. In this case there are two directions of the polarization vector of
the external wave, for which one can observe the contrast minima along the lines which pass
through the atoms. This corresponds to the situations when the polarization vector coincides
with a1 or a2. For the cubic lattice one can get an explicit expression for the angle φc at which
one observes the minimal contrast along the lines which pass through the centers of the cells.

which is valid only for d
a. The dependence φc(d) for the cubic lattice is shown on Fig. 9. As
one can see on the ﬁgure, the angle φc can take the values of dozens of degrees at the distance
from the surface of the order of one lattice constant. The magnitude of the angle remains
essential at the distances of several lattice constants.

Thus, changing the direction of the polarization vector of the external wave one can ma-
nipulate the image contrast. One can determine the atomic positions and the symmetry of the
crystal lattice detecting the intensity minima. Measuring the angle between the directions of
the polarization vector of the external wave, at which the minimal image contrast is reached,
one can get the information about the local ﬁelds inside the ﬁlm. Having on hand this in-
formation and measuring the angle φc between the translation vectors of the lattice and the
polarization vector of the external wave one can determine the distance between the probe and
the surface.

The analysis based on eq.(25) allows one to say that formula (45) remains valid in the case
of arbitrary incident angle of s-polarized wave as well. One has to note that in the near-ﬁeld
optical measurements it is more useful to work with p-polarized waves [36].
In the case of
arbitrary incidence angle of p-polarized wave the distribution of the ﬁeld in the near zone is
essentially diﬀerent. This has been shown in Ref. [8] on the basis of numerical calculations. We
intend to give a detailed description of the ﬁeld behavior in the near zone at arbitrary incident
angles in our subsequent publications.

6 Conlcusions

We have solved a boundary problem of the linear classical optics devoted to the investigation of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld behavior near the surface of a dielectric medium taking into account

22

its discrete structure. The main attention has been paid to the investigation of the near-zone
optical properties of dielectrics.
It has been shown that at the distances from the surface
less than two lattice constants the behavior of the reﬂected and transmitted waves is entirely
diﬀerent from what we have in the wave zone. The intensity distribution in the near zone allows
one to determine the atomic positions at the surface.

We have shown that at the distances from the surface larger than the interatomic distance in
the ﬁlm the probe which measures the ﬁeld does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ﬁeld distribution
In the present paper we have suggested a method of the optical control of the
in the ﬁlm.
distance between the probe and the surface. The method is based on the analysis of the near-
ﬁeld distribution at diﬀerent directions of the polarization vector of the external radiation.

At ﬁrst glance the system treated in our paper (ultrathin dielectric ﬁlm without any sub-
strate) seems to be unrealistic. However, it can be used for the investigation of the near-zone
optical properties of the ﬁlms of arbitrary thicknesses. As we have shown the near-zone optical
response of a material is deﬁned mainly by the evanescent harmonics, which play an important
role only within few interatomic distances near the surface, because they decay very rapidly.
This means that the “bulk” monolayers inﬂuence signiﬁcantly only the wave-zone optical prop-
erties and does not change much the ratio between propagating and evanescent harmonics.

Our results can be useful not only for the development of the ultrahigh resolution near-ﬁeld
microscopy, but also for the investigation of the optical properties of photonic crystals in the
long wavelength approximation.

The results obtained in the present paper are valid not only in the case of an ideal crystal
lattice, but also when the medium has only short-range order as in the case of real surfaces.
Indeed, the methods based on the Fourier transform and the Lorentz method give analogous
results. At the same time only the short-range order is important for the Lorentz method and
the magnitude of the dipole ﬁeld is mainly determined by the atoms located at the distance
3 lattice constants. The atomic distribution
from the observation point of the order of 2
outside of this region does not practically inﬂuence the ﬁeld.

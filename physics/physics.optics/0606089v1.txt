ABSTRACT

Model of partially coherent pulses, based on the concept of “hidden coherence”, introduced recently by Picozzi
and Haelterman in framework of parametric wave mixing, is presented. The nonuiform and nonstationary phase
shift, while completely deterministic, results in the beam properties, which are typical for partially coherent light
— low contrast of interference eﬀects, increase of spectral width and so on — i. e.
light becomes eﬀectively
non-coherent. The proposed model is studied in framework of coherent mode decomposition, its main properties
and limitations of the model are discussed.

Keywords: Coherence, pulsed beam, phase shift, Shell-model

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

Nowadays there is a constant interest to use the partially coherent light in optical systems. Among the important
problems related to partially coherent light are study of light propagation, image formation, pulse shaping,
light interaction with nonlinear media, etc. All of these problems require adequate models of radiation, which
should describe its spatial, spectral and statistical properties; at the same time analytically described models are
advantageous. For stationary beams such model is well-known: it is the Shell model,1 especially Gaussian Shell-
model (GSM) and its generalizations. Pulsed partially coherent beams is also described by various generalizations
of the Shell-model,2–6 usually with the Gaussian proﬁle of temporal dependence of correlation function.

In the present work, another model of partially coherent pulses is presented.

It is based on the concept
of “hidden coherence”, introduced recently by Picozzi and Haelterman7 in the framework of parametric wave
mixing. Such radiation is completely coherent along some spatio-temporal trajectories in 4D space, but is neither
completely spatially nor temporally coherent (from the point of view of usual interferometric experiments, such
as Young double-slit interferometer). In the other words, waveﬁelds with complex spatio-temporal structure are
“operationally” equivalent to partially coherent beams.9

As an example, nonuiform and nonstationary phase shift (completely deterministic, such as in non-linear
self-phase modulation,8 or, for relatively large characteristic time intervals — by mechanical motion of lenses,
mirrors, or phase screens10, 11) results in the beam properties, which are typical for partially coherent light — low
contrast of interference eﬀects, increase of spectral width and so on — i.e. light becomes eﬀectively non-coherent.

In present paper, a quite a simple model of eﬀectively partially coherent pulses is studied in framework of

coherent mode decomposition, its main properties and limitations of the model are discussed.

2. MODAL APPROACH TO PARTIAL COHERENCE DESCRIPTION
(KARHUNEN-LO´EVE DECOMPOSITION)
A complex ﬁeld (analytic signal) of a light beam cross-section is considered as sum of factorized, mutually
orthogonal (and normalized) components

νk is amplitude of kth component.

Could be used in quasi-1D (or 1 + 1 + 1D) problems, e. g. with strip-source illumination.

Disadvantage: the proposed model requires large phase shifts at beam edges and on pulse rise and fall.

Generation: using specially designed moving DOE (diﬀractive optical element). Possibly together with lens

and a (chirp-like) phase modulator.

Approximation: Nonlinear self-phase modulation

6. DISCUSSION OF 2D CASE

One more disadvantage of the model: diﬃculty of its generalization to more realistic case of 2D aperture. It is
preferable, that ﬁeld is Rotationally invariant, then use of term like

(cid:17)
leafs to a phase singularity near x = y = 0. An alternative variant with

(cid:1)

does not lead to Gaussian shape of spatial correlation function.

Moreover, in general, taking into account properties of modal decomposition of 1D (temporal ΓT (t, t′)) and
2D spatial ΓS(x, x′) kernels, it is possible to show, that deterministic double-Gaussian Shell-model pulsed beams
are impossible.

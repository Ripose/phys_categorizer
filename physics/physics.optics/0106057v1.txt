Motivated by the recent observation of periodic ﬁlter characteristics of an oval-shaped micro-cavity,
we study the possible interference of multiple beams in the far ﬁeld of a laser-illuminated quadrupo-
lar glass ﬁber. From numerical ray-tracing simulations of the experimental situation we obtain
the interference-relevant length-diﬀerence spectrum and compare it with data extracted from the
experimental ﬁlter results. Our analysis reveals that diﬀerent polygonal cavity modes being refrac-
tively output-coupled in the high-curvature region of the ﬁber contribute to the observed far-ﬁeld
interference.

Introduction. Optical ﬁbers and cavities have attracted
a lot of interest in recent years. On the theoretical side, a
plethora of phenomena related to the interplay of classi-
cal and quantum chaos is found [1,2]. On the experimen-
tal side, ﬁbers are used either as (active) lasing ﬁbers
in microlasers, or as (passive) optical ﬁlters which are
of great technological interest for planar integrated ﬁl-
ter applications. Planar dielectric ring and disc cavities
have been used as micron-sized optical ﬁlters mainly with
evanescent light coupling, working with nearly total in-
ternal reﬂection. However, evanescent coupling between
the cavity curved sidewall and the waveguide ﬂat sidewall
requires a very precise fabrication with a gap spacing in
the sub-µm range. Therefore, ﬁlter techniques using non-
evanescent coupling which allows gap sizes larger than
sub-µm are technologically desirable.

Interestingly, recent experiments [3] using an oval-
shaped micro-cavity have shown periodic output ﬁlter
characteristics which are potentially useful in the above
context. The purpose of this paper is to present an anal-
ysis of the experimental data and numerical ray-tracing
simulations which allow a theoretical understanding of
these experimental ﬁndings. Our results display a peri-
odic ﬁlter spectrum in the far-ﬁeld interference of refrac-
tively output-coupled modes of the cavity, in agreement
with the experiment. We will show that the interfer-
ence of multiple beam parts corresponding to polygonal
round-trip orbits can lead to the observed periodic ﬁlter
characteristics in a narrow window of the far-ﬁeld angle.
First we brieﬂy summarize the experiment of Ref. [3]:
A passive (non-lasing) quadrupolar ﬁber of high-
refraction glass (n = 1.8) is illuminated by a laser beam,
Fig. 1a. The tunable laser source with wavelengths in the
670 nm range produces a Gaussian beam with a width
(spot size) of 30 µm, the cavity axes are 150 and 180
µm. The far-ﬁeld elastic scattering spectrum is mea-
sured with a linear array detector. It shows ﬁlter reso-
nances as function of incoming wavelength with a good
peak to background ratio of about 40, Fig. 2a, but only
under very speciﬁc input and output coupling angles θi,o

(“magic window”). The periodicity of the spectrum is a
clear sign of the interference nature of the phenomenon;
in addition the ﬁlter peaks display inhomogeneous broad-
ening which is an indication of multimode interference.
The light wavelength λ is much smaller than the size of
the cavity, therefore quantum eﬀects can be assumed to
be small.

Analysis of experimental data. If we accept that the
periodic output characteristics can be interpreted as in-
terference of (classical) rays, then a length analysis of the
contributing geometric paths appears suitable. We start
by deﬁning the amplitude-weighted length distribution
T (L) for the inferfering rays,

T (L) =

Ai δ(L − Li) ,

(1)

Xpaths i

where Ai and Li are amplitude (at the detector) and
optical length (from source to detector) of each path i
hitting the detector. The interference pattern J(k) as
function of the vacuum wavevector k = 2π/λ is given by

In the last step we have introduced the length-diﬀerence
spectrum S(l), given by the self-convolution (correlation
function) of T (L), S(l) =
dL T (L) T (l + L); for discrete
paths with lengths Li the quantity S(l) will be non-zero
for l = Li −Lj ∀ i, j. The length-diﬀerence spectrum S(l)
will be the main quantity of our analysis, it is related by
Fourier transformation to the observed interference pat-
tern J(k); the information about absolute path lengths
does of course not enter the interference result.

R

The Fourier transform S(l) of a representative set of
experimental data from Ref. [3] is shown in Fig. 2. We
see large contributions to S(l) at roughly equally spaced
l values, it is tempting to identify the spacing with the
path length of one round trip corresponding to a single
dominating cavity orbit. However, the intensity for larger
l is rather small, and the broad peaks suggest that more
than one orbit contributes to S(l). Similar results are
obtained with other data sets of the experiment [3].

At this point it is useful to discuss possible interfer-
ence scenarios. The simplest possibility is interference
of rays tunneling out of a single stable orbit that is
traced over and over again. In this case T (L) contains
equally spaced peaks with monotonically decreasing in-
tensity (∼ t(1 − t)i−1 where t is the tunneling rate and
i the number of round trips); a similar decay is then
also found in the peaks of the diﬀerence spectrum S(l).
For the particular case of the quadrupolar ﬁber a can-
didate stable orbit is the “diamond”, here the tunneling
rate is rather small. From this one would expect a slow,
monotonous decay of the peak intensities in S(l) – obvi-
ously this is not in agreement with the experimental data.
Furthermore, in the present experimental geometry the
diamond-like orbit cannot be excited by refractive input
coupling, but only by tunneling – the resulting intensity is
much lower than for refractive coupling, and is too small
to account for the experimental observation. Other orbits
like rectangular/trapezoidal modes or whispering-gallery
(WG) orbits [2] are either unstable or cannot be excited
with the present non-evanescent coupling. We are there-
fore lead to consider the interference of rays from multiple
orbits as explanation for the observations of Ref. [3].

Ray-tracing simulations. We focus a two-dimensional
geometry representing the cross-section of the ﬁber used
in the experiment, see Fig. 1a. The geometry is de-
ﬁned by the mean radius R of the cavity (R = 82 µm
in Ref. [3]) and its excentricity ǫ ≈ 0.1. The quadrupole
boundary is given by r(φ) = R(1+ǫ cos 2φ) in polar co-
ordinates, and the lengths of the half axes are R(1 ± ǫ).
The incoming beam is discretized into a suﬃciently
high number of equally spaced parallel rays, for simplic-
ity we employ a rectangular beam proﬁle. The intensity
fraction of each ray that penetrates into the quadrupole
is given by the Fresnel formula, its angle by Snell’s law.

Quantum eﬀects are negligible due to λ ≪ R. The dy-
namics of each ray is then governed by the laws of a “Fres-
nel billiard” [2,4], i.e., by straight propagation, specu-
lar reﬂection at the quadrupolar shaped boundaries, and
evolution of the intensity according to Fresnel’s law for
reﬂection and transmission. In particular, for TE polari-
sation [3] the Fresnel laws for the reﬂected (transmitted)
electric ﬁeld strength Er (Et) for a incoming ﬁeld Ei are
given by [5]

where n is the refractive index of the cavity material,
n = 1 outside the cavity, and χ is the boundary an-
gle of incidence, Fig. 1. Strictly, these relations hold for
a planar interface; modiﬁed Fresnel formulae for curved
interfaces can be derived [8], but in the present case of
a very large size parameter, R ≫ λ, the curvature ef-
fect is negligible. We assume perfectly reﬂecting walls
for angles of incidence χ bigger than the critical angle,
χc = arcsin(1/n), and exclude leakage due to quantum
tunneling.

In the simulation, we trace each ray of the incom-
ing beam numerically to construct the interference pat-
tern [2,7]. For angles χ < χc we allow for refractive
escape of the part of the ray that is determined by
Eq. (4), but follow further the remaining part inside the
quadrupole until its intensity falls below a threshold of
10−6 of the initial intensity due to subsequent subcritical
reﬂections. For the transmitted part, we determine the

In Fig. 1b we show a couple of typical trajectories that
are found upon scanning of the incoming beam. Due to
the ﬁnite excentricity and the ﬁnite beam width we ﬁnd
not only WG orbits but a large number of orbits which es-
cape (as well as enter) around the points of highest curva-
ture of the quadrupole, as known from the study of asym-
metric resonance cavities [2,7]. In particular, we ﬁnd rays
that undergo several polygonal-like round trips (in con-
trast to typical WG orbits they come closer to the center
of the quadrupole) before their intensity eventually drops
below the threshold. This process of intensity loss may
happen at one single reﬂection or (more likely) upon a
couple of subsequent reﬂections/transmissions. Due to
the preferred escape points near the highest wall curva-
ture [2], the distribution of the orbit lengths, measured
from entering the ﬁber until escape, is sharply peaked at
integer multiples of half the length of a round trip. Orbits
with approximately 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 round trips are shown in
Fig. 1b – these (and similar longer) orbits contribute to
the far-ﬁeld interference for an output angle as chosen in
Fig. 1a, i.e., for output points opposite to the incident
beam.

Given the experimental ﬁndings, we are especially in-
terested in rays with escape direction within the “magic
window”. The ﬁlter characteristics was observed in the
far-ﬁeld total intensity – in this situation the detector
is placed at a distance large compared to the cavity ra-
dius. Therefore only rays within a narrow window of the
output angle θo are detected, whereas the exact escape

position on the quadrupolar boundary is of no impor-
tance. In contrast, in a near ﬁeld measurement (usually
done with a focussing lens) a narrow interval of output
positions is sampled, with a rather large range of output
angles.

e

We now turn to the ray-tracing simulation results for
the far-ﬁeld interference. The primary output of the sim-
ulation are the ray trajectories, their escape points and
output angles, and the output (transmission) intensities
which result from the Fresnel formulae (4). Fig. 3a shows
lengths
L and output angles θo in the form of a inten-
sity histogram plot (“Fresnel-weighted” histogram) for a
ﬁxed input angle θi = 60o. Here,
L are the geometric
orbit lengths inside the cavity in units of R; the optical
lengths are found from L = n
LR + Lext + Lphase, where
Lext are external length diﬀerences arising from the dif-
ferent input and output points of the interfering rays,
and Lphase is determined by the phase shifts that occur
upon the reﬂections. Note that the quantity shown in
Fig. 3a is the output-angle-resolved version of the length
spectrum T (L) deﬁned in (1). For most output angles,
the intensities are rather small, and arise primarily from
short lengths
L. However, in a narrow window which cor-
responds to escape points in the high-curvature region,
the total output intensity is larger, and short as well as
longer orbits carry signiﬁcant weight.

If we now integrate the above quantity over a small
range of far-ﬁeld angles corresponding to the angle range
convered by the detector, we obtain the length spectrum
T (
L), shown in Fig. 3b. The peaks are easily found to
correspond to orbits as shown in Fig. 1b (and longer
ones). After converting
L into optical lengths L, we ob-
tain from T (L) the length-diﬀerence spectrum S(l) by
self-convolution, and by Fourier transformation [9] the
resulting interference pattern J(k) as function of the
wavevector k = 2π/λ, Fig. 4.

is rather small (“magic window”). The analysis of the
length-diﬀerence spectrum allows for a clear distinction
between our model of interfering rays from diﬀerent or-
bits and other scenarios involving a single orbit only. We
note that the TE polarization used in Ref. [3] allows for a
very eﬃcient Brewster-angle input and output ﬁber cou-
pling.

Issues to be discussed in future work include (i) a com-
parison to the case of TM polarization, (ii) the precise
connection of the observed interference to chaotic cac-
ity trajectories, and (iii) possible application of the ﬁlter
eﬀect for beam and/or cavity diagnostics.

and the same holds for S(l), since T (L) is real. However,
the numerical Fourier transform of J(k), taken from a ﬁ-
nite interval 0 < k1 < k < k2, can acquire a phase factor,

Qualitative agreement between experiment and theory
is most easily checked by comparing the length-diﬀerence
spectra S(l), Figs. 2b and 4b. The main feature, namely a
number of roughly equally spaced peaks with comparable
intensity, but very little intensity at larger lengths, is
nicely reproduced by the ray-tracing data.

We note that one cannot expect to reach a quantita-
tive agreement with experiment due to the uncertainty
in experimental parameters like size and excentricity of
the ﬁber and angle of the illuminating laser beam. The
precise interference pattern depends strongly on these pa-
rameters, in particular it is extremely sensitive to length
changes of the order of the light wavelength. For this rea-
son we have neglected both Lext and Lphase when plot-
ting Fig. 4. These contributions to the optical length are
of the order of one or several wavelengths, and are cer-
tainly smaller than the uncertainty in the ﬁber size. We
have checked that the interference pattern depends only
slightly on the numerical discretization procedure used
for the incoming beam.

By varying input and output angles, our simulation
data clearly show that in most situations the rays from
all parts of the incident beam travel in polygonal cavity
orbits only for a very short time (up to 2 round trips)
before they leave the cavity via refraction. Only for a
narrow range of input angles an appreciable part of the
beam leads to polygonal orbits with a longer lifetime,
which then are refractively output-coupled after a larger
number of round trips into a narrow window of far-ﬁeld
angles. The far-ﬁeld output angle window depends sensi-
tively on the input angle, so we predict that the “magic
window” as observed in Ref. [3] will move (in the far-ﬁeld
angle) with varying input angle of the beam. In partic-
ular, for θi = 70o we found the magic window at output
angles 10o smaller than for θi = 60o, whereas for θi = 50o
the ﬁlter eﬀect almost disappears.

In addition, a number of conditions have to be met to
observe the cavity ﬁlter eﬀect: (i) A ﬁnite excentricity
of the ﬁber is needed to produce (chaotic) orbits which
come close to the center of the quadrupole and leave it
by refraction preferrably near the points of highest cur-
vature. (ii) The intensity loss per round trip should be
neither too small nor too large. In the former case, too
many individual orbits (with slightly diﬀerent lengths)
contribute to the far-ﬁeld interference leading to an in-
coherent response, whereas in the latter case the number
of contributing beams is too small to produce a sharp
interference pattern. This puts constraints on the refrac-
tive index of the ﬁber. We have performed simulations
with other ﬁber geometries and refraction indices which
conﬁrm the points (i) and (ii) above: using e.g. n = 1.5
the ﬁlter eﬀect disappears.

Summary. Our ray-tracing model appears to describe
the main features found in the experiment [3]. In particu-
lar, the range of input and output angles, where far-ﬁeld
interference with ﬁlter characteristics can be observed,

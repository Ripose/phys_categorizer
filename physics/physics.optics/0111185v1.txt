Forbidden Region

1 Introduction

The motion of an electromagnetic wave, through a classically-forbidden region,
has recently attracted renewed interest because of its implication with regard to
the theoretical and experimental problems of superluminality. From an exper-
imental point of view, many papers provide an evidence of superluminality in
diﬀerent physical systems[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Theoretically, the problem of a pas-
sage through a forbidden gap has been treated by considering plane waves at
oblique incidence into a plane parallel layer of a medium with a refractive index
smaller than the index of the surrounding medium, and also conﬁned (Gaus-
sian) beams, still at oblique incidence[7, 8, 9, 10]. In the present paper the case
of a Bessel beam is examined, at normal incidence into the layer (Secs. II and
III), in the scalar approximation (Sec. IV) and by developing also a vectorial
treatment (Sec. V). Conclusions are reported in Sic. VI.

2 The Bessel beam

An interesting solution of the wave equation is represented by the Bessel beam
with axial symmetry having, as known[11, 12], the following expression:

u(ρ, ψ, z) = AJ0(k0nρ sin θ0) exp(ik0nz cos θ0) ,

(1)

where A is an amplitude factor, J0 denotes the zero-order Bessel function of ﬁrst
kind, ρ, ψ, z are cylindrical coordinates (Fig. 1a), θ0 is the parameter of the
beam (Axicon angle), n is the refractive index of the medium where the beam
propagates, and k0 is the wavenumber in the vacuum. The beam is independent
of the angular coordinate ψ. The time factor exp(−iωt) is omitted in Eq. (1).
The unusual features of a Bessel beam are that its phase propagates (in the
z direction) with a velocity v = c/(n cos θ0) larger than c/n[12, 13], and that it
does not changes its shape during propagation (the amplitude is independent of
z). The situation is similar to what occurs when only two plane waves interfere,
the only diﬀerence being that the two-wave interference pattern occupies the

whole space, while the ﬁeld (1) is practically limited to a restricted zone of
space (k0nρ sin θ0 < 2.4, 2.4 being the ﬁrst zero of J0). In this connection, it
is worth noting that the ﬁeld of Eq. (1) is not properly a beam, since it is not
limited by a caustic surface, inasmuch as J0 oscillates when its argument tends
to inﬁnity.

The meaning of the parameter θ0 is the following. Let us refer the space to

a system of Cartesian coordinates x, y, z, (unit vectors i, j, k), such that

Let us also consider a system of spherical coordinates r, θ, ϕ, with origin in the
origin of the Cartesian coordinates, and the θ = 0 semiaxis coinciding with the
positive z-axis.

Let us now consider a set of plane waves, with the same amplitude Adϕ, and
with directions of propagation s = αi+ βj + γk making the same angle θ0 with
the z-axis. Each wave can be written as

(3)

(4)

A exp[ik0n(αx + βy + γz)] dϕ ,

where the well-known relations hold (see Fig. 1b):

α = sin θ0 cos ϕ , β = sin θ0 sin ϕ , γ = cos θ0 .

If we integrate expression (3) over dϕ between 0 and 2π, and recall the properties
of the Bessel function J0[14], we arrive at Eq. (1)

(5)

If beam (1) impinges normally into a plane parallel layer of refractive index n′,
limited by the planes z = 0 and z = d (Fig.2), the plane waves (3) form an inci-
dence angle i = θ0 which may be larger than the limit angle i0 = arcsin(n/n′). In
this case, the plane waves undergo total reﬂection, and the layer is a classically-
forbidden region for the Bessel beam, in spite of the fact that the beam impinges
normally into the layer.

3 Total reﬂection for a Bessel beam

The preceding expansion of a Bessel beam in plane waves whose directions of
propagation cover a conical surface of semiaperture θ0 immediately indicates
what happens when the Bessel beam impinges (at z = 0) into a plane surface
separating two media of diﬀerent refractive indexes n and n′. Each plane wave
forms the same incidence angle θ0 and, hence, also the same refraction angle θ′,
satisfying

Here, it may be interesting to note that, if cos θ′ is real, the phase of the Bessel
beam for z > 0 propagates in the z-direction, normally therefore to the bound-
ary. The phase velocity turns out to be c/(n′ cos θ′), i.e.
larger than the light
velocity in the n′ medium. If cos θ′ is purely imaginary (that is, for θ0 larger

than i0), the single plane waves composing the incident Bessel beam are in total
reﬂection, and therefore give rise to plane refracted waves the phase of which
propagates parallel to the boundary. However, for the refracted Bessel beam,
there is no phase propagation for z > 0: there is a sort of stationary ﬁeld. Here
as follows, only the latter case will be considered, namely:

If the beam of Eq. (1) impinges normally into the layer of Fig. 2, it gives rise:
i - on the left of the ﬁrst boundary (z < 0), to a reﬂected Bessel beam which
propagates in the negative direction of the z-axis;
ii - inside the layer (0 < z < d), to two Bessel beams, a “progressive” one and
a “regressive” one;

iii - on the right of the second boundary (z > d), to one transmitted Bessel
beam, which propagates in the positive z-direction.

The continuity conditions of the total ﬁeld at the boundaries z = 0 and z = d
may be easily satisﬁed with a suitable choice of the complex amplitudes of the
beams, and of the parameter θ′ in the argument of the Bessel beams inside the
layer. Using standard procedure, let us write the incident ﬁeld in the form

(z ≤ 0)

Due to the exponential dependence of u+ and u− on z, the progressive and
regressive beams inside the layer may be denoted as “evanescent” Bessel beams.
The ratio R = Ar/Ai is the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the layer for the Bessel

beam; the ratio T = At/Ai is the transmission coeﬃcient.

By denoting the total ﬁeld at any point of the space by utot, the boundary

conditions can be written as

utot(z = 0−) = utot(z = 0+)
utot(z = d − 0) = utot(z = d + 0)

and

From the point of view of the ﬁeld iside to the forbidden region, it should be

Equation (21) may be used to evaluate |gradη| = ∂η/∂z, the wavelength

where λ0 = 2π/k0 denotes the free space plane-wave wavelength. It is interesting
to note that for z → d, v′ → c/(n cos θ0), which is equal to the phase velocity
of the trasmitted (z > d) and incident (z < 0) ﬁelds. This is a phenomenon
similar to the one reported in Ref.[10].

The phase diﬀerence ∆Φ of the total internal ﬁeld at z = d from z = 0 is

given by

∆Φ = arctan[tanh(k0n

while, as to the transmitted ﬁeld, it can be noted (see Eq. (12)) that its phase

Thus, ΦT is equal to the phase shift of the transmitted beam at z = d with
respect to that of the incident ﬁeld at z = 0. By comparing Eqs. (23) and (24),
it appears that ΦT does not coincide with the phase gained by the internal ﬁeld
in passing from z = 0 to z = d.

5 The vectorial treatment

In this Section we use the vectorial algorithm for analysing the propagation of
Bessel beams.

5.1 Quasi-TE and quasi-TM beams

For a vectorial treatment of the propagation of a Bessel beam it is suﬃcient
to consider, for example, the function of Eq. (1) as the tangential component
of the electric ﬁeld E. Then, the Maxwell equations allow us to determine the
longitudinal component of E, and the magnetic ﬁeld H as well. The longitudinal
component of E turns out to vanish on the z-axis, for ρ = 0, where the tangential
component has its maximum. Thus, such ﬁeld (E, H) may be named quasi-TE.
If the ﬁeld (E, H) impinges normally on the layer of Fig. 2, it gives rise, as in

7

the scalar approximation, to a reﬂected Bessel beam for z < 0, to a transmitted
beam for z > d, and to a progressive and a regressive Bessel beams for 0 < z < d.
The progressive and regressive beams are evanescent if Eq. (8) holds.

Analogously, we can consider the function u of Eq. (1) as the tangential
component of a magnetic ﬁeld H’, then from the Maxwell equations we can
derive the longitudinal component of H’ and the associated electric ﬁeld E’.
The ﬁeld (E’, H’) may be named quasi-TM.

The complex amplitudes of all the above beams may be determined by im-
posing, at the two boundaries, the continuity conditions for the tangential com-
ponent of both the total electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This allows to determine
in both cases the total ﬁeld inside the forbidden region, its wavelength and its
phase velocity.

Since the treatment is a little cumbersome, we report that diﬀerent wave-
length and diﬀerent phase velocity are found for the quasi-TE and quasi-TM
cases; here we limit ourselves to develop the simpler analysis in the TE and
TM cases. To this end, let us consider a plane TE and a plane TM waves with
a direction of propagation si = αi + βj + γk = sin θ0 cos ϕi + sin θ0 sin ϕj +
cos θ0k. Let them reﬂect and refract through the ﬁrst boundary, then reﬂect
and refract at the second boundary. Lastly, we integrate the three Cartesian
components with respect to ϕ between 0 and 2π.

5.2 The TE case

This case has already been treated in Ref.[9, 10], but in the particular case of
ϕ = 0. Here, we have to generalise the results obtained therein.
For the incident ﬁeld Ei = Exi +Eyj (Ez = 0), let us put

Ex = Ax exp[ ik0n(x sin θ0 cos ϕ + y sin θ0 sin ϕ + z cos θ0) ]dϕ
Ey = Ay exp[ ik0n(x sin θ0 cos ϕ + y sin θ0 sin ϕ + z cos θ0) ]dϕ .

(25)

Since Ei is normal to si, the following relation must hold:

Axα + Ayβ = 0 .

Hence,

Ax cos ϕ + Ay sin ϕ = 0 .

(26)

Equation (26) shows that Ax and Ay depend on ϕ. The solution of Eq. (26),
which remains ﬁnite for any value of ϕ, is

Ax = A sin ϕ
Ay = −A cos ϕ ,

(27)

where A is a constant.

the TE case (solid lines) and in the TM case (dotted lines) plotted vs d for two
values of the parameter θ0. Other parameter values are: ω = 60, n = 1.5, n′ = 1.

At this point, insertion of Eqs. (27) into Eqs. (25) and integration with

respect to ϕ yields (by putting a = 2πA)

Ex,beam = i a sin ψJ1(k0nρ sin θ0) exp (ik0nz cos θ0)
Ey,beam = −i a cos ψJ1(k0nρ sin θ0) exp (ik0nz cos θ0) ,

(28)

where J1 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst order.

The magnetic ﬁeld Hi = Hxi + Hyj + Hzk related to the Ei ﬁeld of the

plane wave is found to be

Hx =

cos θ0 cos ϕ exp[ ik0n(x sin θ0 cos ϕ + y sin θ0 sin ϕ + z cos θ0) ]dϕ

cos θ0 sin ϕ exp[ ik0n(x sin θ0 cos ϕ + y sin θ0 sin ϕ + z cos θ0) ]dϕ

sin θ0J0(k0nρ sin θ0) exp (ik0nz cos θ0) .

(30)

A ﬁeld described by Eqs. (28) and (30) can be denoted as a Bessel beam (of
the ﬁrst order), and has properties very similar to those of the Bessel beam of
Eq. (1). However, only the longitudinal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is of
the type of Eq. (1), that is, picked on the axis at ρ = 0; all other components
for ρ = 0 vanish. A TE plane wave like the one described above gives rise,
at the incidence on the layer of Fig. 2, to a reﬂected ﬁrst-order Bessel beam
and to two transmitted “evanescent” Bessel beams. One of these is progressive
and the other regressive, with coeﬃcients A+ and A− given by the ﬁrst two
Eqs. (17). At the second boundary of the layer, a transmitted ﬁrst-order Bessel
beam originates, with amplitude At given by the third Eq. (17). Accordingly,
the wavelength λT E and the phase velocity vT E inside the layer are again given
by Eqs. (22).

5.3 The TM case

The TM case may be treated in a way analogous to that of the TE case, arriving
at similar results. The only diﬀerence lies in the fact that n must be replaced
by n′, and vice versa, in the coeﬃcients of system (16) (not in the propagation
factors e1 and e2), analogously to what happens in the Fresnel formulas for the
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients of a real plane wave at a plane interface.
Accordingly, the expression of A+, A−, At and Φ′ must be replaced by

1 - The phase shift ∆Φ of the transmitted TM beam (Eq. (23) with Φ′′ instead
of Φ′) at z = d with respect to the incident beam at z = 0 is diﬀerent
from that of the TE case.

2 - The transmission coeﬃcient T for the TM case is diﬀerent in amplitude
(Fig. 3a) and phase (Fig. 3b) with respect to that of the TE case. Con-
sequently, an incident Bessel beam formed by a TE component and by a
TM component gives rise to a transmitted Bessel beam with a diﬀerent
polarisation.

We note that the amplitudes are slowly varying functions of θ0, for both
TE and TM cases. On the contrary, the phase in the case of TE diﬀers
greatly with respect to the TM case, and both of them greatly vary with
θ0.

3 - The phase velocity vT M and the wavelength λT M inside the layer in the

TM case are diﬀerent from those of the TE case,

(32)

where ηT M (z) is such that tan[ηT M (z)] = − tanh[k0n′Γ(d − z)] tan Φ′′.
Figure 4 shows the normalised phase velocities vT M /c (which is equal to

11

λT M /λ0) and vT E/c (equal to λT E/λ0). We note that, immediately after
the ﬁrst boundary the motion is extremely fast since the eﬀect of the
second boundary, which originates the regressive (or “anti-evanescent”)
beam, is negligible. We wish to recall that, in the absence of the second
boundary, the phase velocity is inﬁnite.

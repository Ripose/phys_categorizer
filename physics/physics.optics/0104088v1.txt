1 Introduction

Photonic crystals are usually viewed as an optical analog of semiconductors
that modify the properties of light similar to a microscopic atomic lattice that
creates a semiconductor band-gap for electrons [1]. It is therefore believed
that by replacing relatively slow electrons with photons as the carriers of
information, the speed and band-width of advanced communication systems
will be dramatically increased, thus revolutionizing the telecommunication
industry. Recent fabrication of photonic crystals with a band gap at optical
wavelengths from 1.35 m m to 1.95 m m makes this promise very realistic [2].
To employ the high-tech potential of photonic crystals, it is crucially im-
portant to achieve a dynamical tunability of their band gap [3]. This idea can
be realized by changing the light intensity in the so-called nonlinear photonic
crystals, having a periodic modulation of the nonlinear refractive index [4].
Exploration of nonlinear properties of photonic band-gap (PBG) materials is
an important direction of research that opens new applications of photonic
crystals for all-optical signal processing and switching, allowing an eﬀective
way to create tunable band-gap structures operating entirely with light.

One of the important physical concepts associated with nonlinearity is the
energy self-trapping and localization. In the linear physics, the idea of localiza-
tion is always associated with disorder that breaks translational invariance.
However, during the recent years it was demonstrated that localization can
occur in the absence of any disorder and solely due to nonlinearity in the
form of intrinsic localized modes [5]. A rigorous proof of the existence of
time-periodic, spatially localized solutions describing such nonlinear modes
has been presented for a broad class of Hamiltonian coupled-oscillator non-
linear lattices [6], but approximate analytical solutions can also be found in
many other cases, demonstrating a generality of the concept of nonlinear
localized modes.

Nonlinear localized modes can be easily identiﬁed in numerical molecular-
dynamics simulations in many diﬀerent physical models (see, e.g., Ref. [5] for
a review), but only very recently the ﬁrst experimental observations of spa-
tially localized nonlinear modes have been reported in mixed-valence tran-

2

sition metal complexes [7], quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnetic chains
[8], and arrays of Josephson junctions [9]. Importantly, very similar types
of spatially localized nonlinear modes have been experimentally observed in
macroscopic mechanical [10] and guided-wave optical [11] systems.

Recent experimental observations of nonlinear localized modes, as well as
numerous theoretical results, indicate that nonlinearity-induced localization
and spatially localized modes can be expected in physical systems of very
diﬀerent nature. From the viewpoint of possible practical applications, self-
localized states in optics seem to be the most promising ones; they can lead
to diﬀerent types of nonlinear all-optical switching devices where light ma-
nipulates and controls light itself by varying the input intensity. As a result,
the study of nonlinear localized modes in photonic structures is expected to
bring a variety of realistic applications of intrinsic localized modes.

One of the promising ﬁelds where the concept of nonlinear localized modes
may ﬁnd practical applications is the physics of photonic crystals [or pho-
tonic band gap (PBG) materials] – periodic dielectric structures that produce
many of the same phenomena for photons as the crystalline atomic potential
does for electrons [1]. Three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals for visible
light have been successfully fabricated only within the past year or two, and
presently many research groups are working on creating tunable band-gap
switches and transistors operating entirely with light. The most recent idea
is to employ nonlinear properties of band-gap materials, thus creating nonlin-
ear photonic crystals including those where nonlinear susceptibility is periodic
as well [4,12].

Nonlinear photonic crystals (or photonic crystals with embedded nonlin-
ear impurities) create an ideal environment for the generation and observa-
tion of nonlinear localized photonic modes. In particular, the existence of such
modes for the frequencies in the photonic band gaps has been predicted [13]
for 2D and 3D photonic crystals with Kerr nonlinearity. Nonlinear localized
modes can be also excited at nonlinear interfaces with quadratic nonlinearity
[14], or along dielectric waveguide structures possessing a nonlinear Kerr-type
response [15].

In this Chapter, we study self-trapping of light and nonlinear localized
modes in nonlinear photonic crystals and photonic crystal waveguides. For
simplicity, we consider the case of a 2D photonic crystal with embedded
nonlinear rods (impurities) and demonstrate that the eﬀective interaction
in such a nonlinear waveguide structure is nonlocal (see also Ref. [16]), so
that the nonlinear eﬀects can be described by a nontrivial generalization of
the nonlinear lattice models that include the long-range coupling and nonlo-
cal nonlinearity. We describe several diﬀerent types of nonlinear guided-wave
states in photonic crystal waveguides and analyses their properties. Also, we
predict the existence of nonlinear localized modes (highly localized modes
analogous to gap solitons in the continuum limit) in symmetry-reduced non-
linear photonic crystals.

2 Basic Equations

Let us consider a 2D photonic crystal created by a periodic lattice of parallel,
inﬁnitely long dielectric rods in air (see Fig. 1). We assume that the rods are
parallel to the x3 axis, so that the system is characterized by the dielectric
constant ε(x) = ε(x1, x2). As is well known [1], the photonic crystals of this
type can possess a complete band gap for the E-polarized (with the electric
ﬁeld E || x3) light propagating in the (x1, x2)-plane. The evolution of such a
light is governed by the scalar wave equation

∇2E(x, t) −

where ∇2 ≡ ∂2

.

In the stationary case, i.e. when the r.h.s. of Eq. (2) vanishes, this equation
describes an eigenvalue problem which can be solved, e.g. by the plane waves
method [17], in the case of a perfect photonic crystal, for which the dielectric
constant ε(x) ≡ εp(x) is a periodic function deﬁned as

εp(x + sij) = εp(x) ,

where i and j are arbitrary integers, and

sij = i a1 + j a2

is a linear combination of the lattice vectors a1 and a2.

For deﬁniteness, we consider the 2D photonic crystal earlier analyses (in
the linear limit) in Refs. [18,19]. That is, we assume that cylindrical rods with
radius r0 = 0.18a and dielectric constant ε0 = 11.56 form a square lattice
with the distance a between two neighboring rods, so that a1 = ax1 and
a2 = ax2. The frequency band structure for this type of 2D photonic crystal
is shown in Fig. 1 where, using the notations of the solid-state physics, the
wave dispersion is mapped onto the Brillouin zone of the so-called reciprocal
lattice that faces are known as Γ , M , and X. As follows from Fig. 1, there
exists a large (38%) band gap that extends from the lower cut-oﬀ frequency,
ω = 0.302 × 2πc/a, to the upper band-gap frequency, ω = 0.443 × 2πc/a. If
the frequency of a low-intensity light falls into the band gap, the light cannot
propagate through the photonic crystal and is reﬂected.

3 Defect Modes: The Green’s Function Approach

One of the most intriguing properties of photonic band gap crystals is the
emergence of exponentially localized modes that may appear within the pho-
tonic band gaps when a defect is embedded into an otherwise perfect photonic
crystal. The simplest way to create a defect in a 2D photonic crystal is to
introduce an additional defect rod with the radius rd and the dielectric con-
stant εd(x). In this case, the dielectric constant ε(x) can be presented as a
sum of periodic and defect-induced terms, i.e.

ε(x) = εp(x) + εd(x) ,

and, therefore, Eq. (2) takes the form

Properties of the Green function of a perfect 2D photonic crystal are de-
scribed in more details in Ref. [17]. Here, we notice that the Green function
is symmetric, i.e.

G(x, y | ω) = G(y, x | ω)

and periodic, i.e.

G(x + sij, y + sij | ω) = G(x, y | ω) ,

where sij is deﬁned by Eq. (4).

G(x, y, t) = −δ(t) δ(x − y) ,

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

which has been solved by the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain method [20].

Now that we have calculated the Green’s function, we can ﬁgure out the
defect states solving Eq. (7) directly. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows a defect
mode created by introducing a single defect rod with the radius rd = 0.1a
and dielectric constant εd = 11.56 into the 2D photonic crystal shown in Fig.
1.

A simple solid-state-physics analogy helps to make a giant step towards
photonic applications creating waveguides as arrays of defect rods. In con-
ventional waveguides such as optical ﬁbers, light is conﬁned by total internal
reﬂection due the diﬀerence in the refractive indices of the waveguide core
and cladding. The waveguides based on the PBG materials employ a diﬀerent

6

Serge F. Mingaleev and Yuri S. Kivshar

physical mechanism: the guidance is due to a surrounding band gap structure
that supports a mode that is in the band gap and is forbidden from propa-
gating in a bulk because of the gap, in the way a defect mode is created. That
is, photonic waveguides operate in a manner similar to resonant cavities.

The simplest photonic-crystal waveguide can be created by a straight line
of defect rods, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Instead of a single localized state of
an isolated defect, a waveguide supports propagating states (guided modes)
with the frequencies in a narrow band located inside the band gap of a perfect
crystal. Such guided modes have a periodical proﬁle along the waveguide, and
they decay exponentially in the transverse direction, see Fig. 2(b).

One of the weaknesses of conventional optical waveguides based on the
conﬁnement due to a total internal reﬂection is that creating bends is diﬃcult.
Unless the radius of the bend is large compared to the wavelength, much of
the light will be lost. This is a serious problem in creating “integrated optical
circuits”, since the space required for large-radius bends is unavailable. Since
the physical principles for the operation of photonic crystals are diﬀerent,
when a bend is created in the waveguide, the light remains trapped and the
only possible problem is that of reﬂection. However, it is still possible to get
almost 100% transmission, as was recently demonstrated numerically [18,19]
and also veriﬁed experimentally [21,22].

4 Nonlinear Waveguides in 2D Photonic Crystals

In this Section, we follow the results of Ref. [16] and describe the properties of
nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides created by inserting an additional row
of rods made from a Kerr-type nonlinear material characterized by the third-
order nonlinear susceptibility χ(3) and the linear dielectric constant ε(0)
d . For
deﬁniteness, we assume that ε(0)
d = ε0 = 11.56. As we show below, changing
the radius rd of these defect rods and their location within the crystal, one
can create nonlinear waveguides with quite diﬀerent properties.

4.1 Eﬀective 1D discrete nonlinear equation

Let us assume that the nonlinear defect rods embedded into the photonic
crystal along a selected direction sij are located at the points xm = x0+m sij .
In this case, the correction to the dielectric constant is

(x0 = a1/2 and ω = 0.33 × 2πc/a).

The second term in Eq. (11) takes into account a contribution due to the Kerr
nonlinearity (we assume that the electric ﬁeld is scaled with the nonlinear
susceptibility, χ(3)).

If the radius of the defect rods rd is suﬃciently small, the electric ﬁeld
E(x, t | ω) inside them is almost constant and one can derive, by substituting
Eq. (11) into Eq. (7) and averaging over of the cross-section of the rods [15],

Based on this equation, we provide a systematic analysis of diﬀerent types
of nonlinear localized modes. In particular, it is possible to show [16] that the
approximation of the nearest-neighbor interaction is very crude in many of
the cases analyses. Since the eﬀective coupling coeﬃcients are deﬁned by the
Green’s function, this can be seen directly from Fig. 3 that shows a typical
spatial proﬁle of the Green’s function which, in general, characterizes a long-
range interaction, very typical for photonic crystals. As a consequence of that,
the coupling coeﬃcients Jn(ω) calculated from Eq. (14) decrease slowly with

be approximated by an exponential function as follows

|Jn(ω)| ≈

J0(ω) ,
J∗(ω) e−α(ω)|n| , for |n| ≥ 1 ,

(cid:26)

where the characteristic decay rate α(ω) can be as small as 0.85, depending
on the values of ω, x0, and rd, and it can be even smaller for other types of
photonic crystals (with diﬀerent r0 and ε0).

This result allows us to draw an analogy between the problem under
consideration and a class of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equations that
describe nonlinear excitations in quasi-one-dimensional molecular chains with
long-range (e.g. dipole-dipole) interaction between the particles and local on-
site nonlinearities [23,24]. For such systems, it was shown that the eﬀect of
nonlocal interparticle interaction introduces some new features in the proper-
ties of nonlinear localized modes (in particular, bistability in their spectrum).
Moreover, for our model the coupling coeﬃcients Jn(ω) can be either unstag-
gered and monotonically decaying, i.e. Jn(ω) = |Jn(ω)|, or staggered and
oscillating from site to site, i.e. Jn(ω) = (−1)n|Jn(ω)|. We therefore expect
that eﬀective nonlocality in both linear and nonlinear terms of Eq. (13) will
bring a number of new features into the properties of nonlinear localized
modes excited in the photonic crystal waveguides.

4.2 Staggered and unstaggered localized modes

As can be seen from the structure of the Green’s function presented in Fig. 3,
the case of monotonically varying coeﬃcients Jn(ω) can occur for the waveg-

uide oriented in the s01 direction with x0 = a1/2. In this case, the frequency
of a linear guided mode, that can be excited in such a waveguide, takes a
minimum value at k = 0 [see Fig. 4(a)], and the corresponding nonlinear
mode is expected to be unstaggered.

We have solved Eq. (13) numerically and found that nonlinearity can lead
to the existence of guided modes localized in both directions, i.e. in the direc-
tion perpendicular to the waveguide, due to the guiding properties of a chan-
nel waveguide created by defect rods, and in the direction of the waveguide,
due to the nonlinearity-induced self-trapping eﬀect. Such nonlinear modes
exist with the frequencies below the frequency of the linear guided mode of
the waveguide, i.e. below the frequency ωA in Fig. 4(a), and are indeed un-
staggered, with the bell-shaped proﬁle along the waveguide direction shown
in the left inset of Fig. 4(b).

The 2D nonlinear modes localized in both dimensions can be characterized
by the mode power which we deﬁne, by analogy with the NLS equation, as

Q =

|En|2.

Xn

(15)

This power is closely related to the energy of the electric ﬁeld in the 2D
photonic crystal accumulated in the nonlinear mode. In Fig. 4(b) we plot
the dependence of Q on frequency, for the waveguide geometry shown in Fig.
4(a).

Fig. 6. (a) Dispersion relation for the photonic crystal waveguide shown in the
inset (ε0 = εd = 11.56, r0 = 0.18a, rd = 0.10a). The grey areas are the projected
band structure of the perfect 2D photonic crystal. The frequencies at the indicated
points are: ωA = 0.352 × 2πc/a, ωB = 0.371 × 2πc/a, and ωC = 0.376 × 2πc/a (at
k = 0.217 × 2π/a). (b) Mode power Q(ω) of the nonlinear mode excited in the
corresponding photonic crystal waveguide. The right inset shows the behavior of
the coupling coeﬃcients Jn(ω) for n ≥ 1 (J0 = 0.068) at ω = 0.345 × 2πc/a. The
left inset shows the proﬁle of the corresponding nonlinear mode.

As can be seen from the Green’s function shown in Fig. 3, the case of stag-
gered coupling coeﬃcients Jn(ω) can be obtained for the waveguide oriented
in the s10 direction with x0 = a1/2. In this case, the frequency dependence
of the linear guided mode of the waveguide takes the minimum at k = π/a
[see Fig. 5(a)]. Accordingly, the nonlinear guided mode localized along the
direction of the waveguide is expected to exist with the frequency below the
lowest frequency ωA of the linear guided mode, with a staggered proﬁle. The
longitudinal proﬁle of such a 2D nonlinear localized mode is shown in the left
inset in Fig. 5(b), together with the dependence of the mode power Q on the
frequency (solid curve), which in this case is again monotonic.

The results presented above are obtained for linear photonic crystals with
nonlinear waveguides created by a row of defect rods. However, we have
carried out the same analysis for the general case of a nonlinear photonic
crystal that is created by rods of diﬀerent size but made of the same nonlinear
material. Importantly, we have found relatively small diﬀerence in all the
results presented above provided nonlinearity is weak. In particular, for the
photonic crystal waveguide shown in Fig. 5(a), the results for linear and
nonlinear photonic crystals are very close. Indeed, for the mode power Q the
results corresponding to a nonlinear photonic crystal are shown in Fig. 5(b)
by a dashed curve, and for Q < 20 this curve almost coincides with the solid
curve corresponding to the case of a nonlinear waveguide embedded into a
2D linear photonic crystal.

4.3 Instability of nonlinear localized modes

Let us now consider the waveguide created by a row of defect rods which
are located at the points x0 = (a1 + a2)/2, along a straight line in either
the s10 or s01 directions. The results for this case are presented in Figs. 6–7.
The coupling coeﬃcients Jn are described by a slowly decaying staggered
function of the site number n, so that the eﬀective interaction decays on the
scale larger than in the two cases considered above.

It is remarkable that, similar to the NLS models with long-range dispersive
interactions [23,24], we ﬁnd a non-monotonic behavior of the mode power
Q(ω) for this type of nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides: speciﬁcally, Q(ω)
increases in the frequency interval 0.344 < (ωa/2πc) < 0.347 [shaded in
Fig. 7(c)]. One can expect that, similar to the results earlier obtained for the
nonlocal NLS models [23,24], the nonlinear localized modes in this interval
are unstable and will eventually decay or transform into the modes of higher
or lower frequency [25]. What counts is that there is an interval of mode
power in which two stable nonlinear localized modes of diﬀerent widths do

12

coexist. Since the mode power is closely related to the mode energy, one can
expect that the mode energy is also non-monotonic function of ω. Such a
phenomenon is known as bistability, and in the problem under consideration
it occurs as a direct manifestation of the nonlocality of the eﬀective (linear
and nonlinear) interaction between the defect rod sites.

Being interested in the mobility of the nonlinear localized modes we in-
vestigated, in addition to the symmetric modes shown in the left inset in
Fig. 6(b) and in Fig. 7(a), also the antisymmetric localized modes shown in
Fig. 7(b). Our calculations show that the power Q(ω) of the antisymmet-
ric modes always (for all values of ω and all types of waveguides) exceeds
that for symmetric ones [see, e.g., Fig. 7(c)]. Thus, antisymmetric modes are
expected to be unstable and they should decay or transform into a lower-
energy symmetric modes. In fact, the diﬀerence between power of antisym-
metric and symmetric modes determines the Peierls-Nabarro barrier which
characterizes the mobility of nonlinear localized modes in discrete systems.
One can see in Fig. 7(c) that the Peierls-Nabarro barrier is negligible for
0.347 < (ωa/2πc) < 0.352 and thus such localized modes should be mobile.
However, the Peierls-Nabarro barrier becomes suﬃciently large for highly lo-
calized modes with ω < 0.344 × 2πc/a and, as a consequence, such modes
should be immobile. Hence, the bistability phenomenon in the photonic crys-
tal waveguides of the type depicted in Figs. 6–7 opens up fresh opportunities
[24] for switching between immobile localized modes (used for energy storage)
and mobile localized modes (used for energy transport).

5 Self-Trapping of Light in a Reduced-Symmetry 2D

Nonlinear Photonic Crystal

In this Section we study the properties of nonlinear localized modes in a 2D
photonic crystal composed of two types of circular rods: the rods of radius r0
made from a linear dielectric material and placed at the corners of a square
lattice with the lattice spacing a, and the rods of radius rd made from a
nonlinear dielectric material and placed at the center of each unit cell (see
right inset in Fig. 8). Recently, such photonic crystals of reduced symmetry
have attracted considerable interest because of their ability to possess larger
absolute band gaps [26]. The band-gap structure of the reduced-symmetry
photonic crystal is shown in Fig. 8. As is seen, it possesses two band gaps,
ﬁrst of which extends from ω = 0.426 × 2πc/a to ω = 0.453 × 2πc/a.

A low-intensity light cannot propagate through a photonic crystal if the
light frequency falls into a band gap. However, it has been recently suggested
[13] that in the case of a 2D periodic medium with a Kerr-type nonlinear
material, high-intensity light with frequency inside the gap can propagate in
the form of ﬁnite energy solitary waves – 2D gap solitons. These solitary waves
were found to be stable [13], but the conclusion was based on the coupled-
mode equations valid for a weak modulation of the dielectric constant ε(x).

by the MIT Photonic-Bands program [27] whereas dashed line is found from the
eﬀective discrete model. The top center inset shows a cross-sectional view of the
2D photonic crystal depicted in the right inset. The bottom center inset shows the
corresponding Brillouin zone.

However, in real photonic crystals the modulation of ε(x) is comparable to
its average value. Thus, the results of Ref. [13] have a limited applicability
to the properties of localized modes in realistic photonic crystals.

More speciﬁcally, the coupled-mode equations are valid if and only if the
band gap ∆ is vanishingly small, i. e. ∆ ∼ A2 where A is an eﬀective am-
plitude of the mode, that is a small parameter in the multi-scale asymptotic
expansions [28]. If we apply this model to describe nonlinear modes in a wider
gap (see, e.g., discussions in Ref. [28]), we obtain a 2D nonlinear Schr¨odinger
(NLS) equation known to possess no stable localized solutions. Moreover, the
2D localized modes described by the coupled-mode equations are expected
to possess an oscillatory instability recently discovered for a broad class of
coupled-mode Thirring-like equations [29]. Thus, it is clear that, if nonlinear
localized modes do exist in realistic PBG materials, their stability should be
associated with diﬀerent physical mechanisms not accounted for by simpliﬁed
continuum models.

5.1 Eﬀective 2D discrete nonlinear equation

The reduced-symmetry ”diatomic” photonic crystal shown in Fig. 8 can be
considered as a square lattice of the “nonlinear defect rods” of small radius
rd (rd < r0) embedded into the ordinary single-rod photonic crystal formed
by a square lattice of rods of larger radius r0 in air.

The positions of the defect rods can then be described by the radius-vector
xn,m = n a1 + m a2, where a1 and a2 are the primitive lattice vectors of the
2D photonic crystal, while n and m are arbitrary integers. For our model, we

As we discussed in the previous section, the Green’s function G(x, y | ω)
and, consequently, the coupling coeﬃcients Jn,m(ω) are usually highly long-
ranged functions. For instance, to reach accurate results for the photonic
crystal depicted in Fig. 8 one should take into account the interaction between
at least 10 neighbors (see Fig. 9). By this means, Eq. (17) is a nontrivial long-
range generalization of a 2D discrete NLS equation extensively studied during
the last decade [30]. We have checked the accuracy of the approximation
provided by Eq. (17) solving it in the linear limit, in order to ﬁnd the band-gap
structure associated with linear stationary mode. The low-frequency part of

this dependence is depicted in Fig. 8 by a dashed line, with a minimum at ω =
0.446×2πc/a. One can see that the frequencies of the linear modes calculated
from Eq. (17) are in a good agreement with those calculated directly from
Eq. (2). It lends a support to the validity of Eq. (17) and allows us to use it
for studying nonlinear properties.

5.2 Nonlinear 2D localized modes

Stationary nonlinear modes described by Eq. (17) are found numerically by
the Newton-Raphson iteration scheme. We reveal the existence of a contin-
uous family of such modes, and a typical example [smoothed by continuous
optimization for Eq. (5)] of nonlinear localized mode is shown in Fig. 10.
Besides Hamiltonian, Eq. (17) conserves the mode power deﬁned as

Q(ω) =

|En,m|2 ,

Xn,m

(19)

which is proportional to the energy of the electric ﬁeld accumulated in the
nonlinear localized modes. In Fig. 11, we plot the dependence of the mode
power Q on the frequency ω for the photonic crystal shown in Fig. 8. As we
have already discussed, this dependence represents a very important charac-
teristic of nonlinear localized modes which allows to determine their stability
by means of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov stability criterion: dQ/dω > 0 for un-
stable modes (this criterion has been extended to 2D NLS models in [31]).

Fig. 11. Power Q of the nonlinear localized mode vs. its frequency for the 2D
photonic crystal shown in Fig. 8. Solid lines correspond to stable modes whereas
dashed line indicates the interval of instability (with dQ/dω > 0). The grey areas
show the projected band structure of the crystal. Insets show typical proﬁles of
stable modes.

As is well known (see, e.g., Refs. [31,32]), in the unbounded 2D NLS equa-
tion with linear dispersive interactions the only high-amplitude intrinsically
localized modes are stable. One can see from Fig. 11 that such high-amplitude
modes are also stable in the case of the photonic crystal under consideration.
However, to excite these modes one should use the light beam of unreason-
ably high intensity (for the modern nonlinear dielectrics with relatively small
nonlinear susceptibility χ(3)). Usually the low-amplitude modes in 2D NLS
models are unstable and either collapse or decay [30]. In fact, they can be
stabilized by some external forces (e.g., due to interactions with boundaries
or disorder [33]), but in this case the excitations are pinned and cannot be
used for energy or signal transfer.

Here we show that, in a sharp contrast to the 2D discrete NLS models dis-
cussed earlier, the low-amplitude modes of Eq. (17) can be stabilized due to
the presence of nonlinear long-range dispersion in this equation. For instance,
as is seen from Fig. 11, the low-amplitude modes of the photonic crystal being
considered in Fig. 8 are stable. It should be emphasized that such stabiliza-
tion does not occur in the models with only linear long-range dispersion [30].
In order to gain a better insight into the stabilization mechanism, we have
carried out the studies of Eq. (17) for the exponentially decaying coupling
coeﬃcients Jn,m. Our results reveal that the most important factor which de-
termines stability of the low-amplitude modes is the ratio of the coeﬃcients
at the local nonlinearity (∼ J0,0) and the nonlinear dispersion (∼ J0,1). If the
coupling coeﬃcients Jn,m decrease with the distances n and m rapidly, the
low-amplitude modes are essentially stable for J0,0/J0,1 . 13. However, this

Nonlinear Localized Modes in Photonic Crystals

17

estimation is usually lowered because the stabilization is favored by the pres-
ence of long-range interactions. Since the discussed stabilization mechanism
of low-amplitude modes preserves the translational symmetry of the system,
such modes are expected to be mobile.

It should be emphasized that the stabilization of low-amplitude modes is
not inherent to all types of nonlinear photonic crystals. On the contrary, the
photonic crystals must be carefully designed to support stable low-amplitude
modes. For example, in the photonic crystal with r1 = 0.18a and r2 = 0.10a
the ratio J0,0/J0,1 exceeds 18 and such modes are always unstable.

6 Concluding Remarks

Exploration of nonlinear properties of PBG materials may open new im-
portant application of photonic crystals for all-optical signal processing and
switching, allowing an eﬀective way to create tunable band-gap structures op-
erating entirely with light. Nonlinear photonic crystals, and nonlinear waveg-
uides created in the photonic structures with a periodically modulated dielec-
tric constant, create an ideal environment for the generation and observation
of nonlinear localized modes.

As follows from our results, nonlinear localized modes can be excited in
photonic crystal waveguides of diﬀerent geometry. For several geometries of
2D waveguides, we have demonstrated that such modes are described by
a new type of nonlinear lattice models that include long-range interaction
and eﬀectively nonlocal nonlinear response. It is expected that the general
features of nonlinear guided modes described here will be preserved in other
types of photonic crystal waveguides. Additionally, similar types of nonlinear
localized modes are expected in photonic crystal ﬁbers [34] consisting of a
periodic air-hole lattice that runs along the length of the ﬁber, provided the
ﬁber core is made of a highly nonlinear material (see, e.g., Ref. [35]).

Experimental observation of nonlinear photonic localized modes would
require not only the use of photonic materials with a relatively large nonlinear
refractive index (such as AlGaAs waveguide PBG structures [36] or polymer
PBG crystals [37], but also a control of the group-velocity dispersion and
band-gap parameters. The latter can be achieved by employing the surface
coupling technique [38] that is able to provide coupling to speciﬁc points of the
dispersion curve, opening up a very straightforward way to access nonlinear
eﬀects.

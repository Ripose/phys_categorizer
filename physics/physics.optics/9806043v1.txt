Abstract

The new mechanism for obtaining a nonlinear phase shift has been
proposed and the schemes are described for its implementation. As
it is shown, the interference of two waves with intensity-dependent
amplitude ratio coming from the second harmonic generation should
produce the nonlinear phase shift. The sign and amount of nonlinear
distortion of a beam wavefront is dependent of the relative phase of
the waves that is introduced by the phase element. Calculated value
of neﬀ
exceeds that connected with cascaded quadratic nonlinearity,
2
at the same conditions.

There are a lot of potential applications for materials which exhibit a
nonlinear phase shift (NPS) of the incident beam due to a local change of the
refractive index. For instance, the nonlinear phase shift is necessary to obtain
for the new generation of all-optical devices. Typically nonlinear phase shift
has been achieved with an intensity-dependent refractive index coeﬃcient n2
(n = n0 + n2I) due to third-order nonlinear susceptibility χ(3). Currently
another nonlinear physical process that produces a nonlinear distortion in
the phase of a beam appears to be of great interest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The
phase shift utilizes the cascading of two nonlinear second-order processes:
the up-conversion of a fundamental beam to a second harmonics (SH) and its
subsequent downconversion back to the fundamental. A number of possible
schemes of all-optical devices are discussed in Ref. [6].

This letter theoretically predicts a new mechanism for nonlinear phase
shift. It is introduced when two waves with intensity-dependent amplitude
ratio interfere. We also suggest optical schemes that one can use to obtain
the nonlinear phase shift of both fundamental wave and its second harmonics.

1

The estimations show that the magnitude of the nonlinear shift may be
several times as large as the one occurring due to cascaded processes under
the same value of exciting intensity and nonlinear medium length.

The essence of the proposed technique can be clariﬁed by the following

simple considerations.

as it is known, by the expression:

The phase Φ of the wave produced by interference of two waves is given,

where a1, a2, φ1, φ2 are the corresponding amplitudes and phases of the
interfering waves. If we happen to produce a dependence of the ratio a2/a1
upon intensity, obviously the phase Φ becomes dependent of the intensity. To
produce this intensity-dependent ratio a2/a1, we will use second harmonics
generation.

Further calculations are shown on the example of two schemes. The ﬁrst
allows one to have NPS in the second-harmonics beam, and the other outputs
an NPS in the fundamental wave.

The ﬁrst scheme (ﬁg. 1a) is essentially, a dispersion interferometer that
makes use of orthogonally polarized second harmonic waves [7]. Both waves
in the dispersion interferometer propagate along the same path. Waves of
diﬀerent frequencies correspond to the two arms of the interferometer, and
the relative phase is gained owing to the dispersion of the phase element. In
ﬁg. 1a: 1,3 — frequency doublers that use type II phase matching (although
an analogous scheme can be constructed for the type I), 2 — phase element
(like an optical wedge with a compensator), 4 — ﬁlter that cuts of the funda-
mental wave, 5 — polarizer or polarizing beam-splitter. The elements have
the following orientation: the frequency doublers are oriented orthogonally,
the fundamental wave is polarized at 450 angle with respect to the optical
axes of the crystals. The axis of the polarizer 5 is at the same angle as the
polarization of the fundamental wave.

The described interferometer has following notable features owing to or-
thogonal polarization of the two second harmonic waves. First, the second
harmonics generated by the ﬁrst doubler is not downconverted inside the

2

second crystal due to the large phase mismatch. Second, the SH waves are
generated in the ﬁrst and the second crystals independently of each other and
interfere behind polarizer 5. Let’s write the complex amplitudes of the two
second harmonic waves as a(2ω)
exp (iφ1), a(2ω)
exp (iφ2). The relative phase
φ1) can be adjusted with a phase element, in our case, due to variable

n(ω) and n(2ω) are refractive indices of the wedge material at frequencies

absent or negligible, i.e. φ1 and φ2 are independent of the intensity. This
implies the following conditions:

where l1, l2 are the lengths of the ﬁrst and second crystals, correspondly, ∆k
— wave-vector mismatch between the fundamental and second harmonics, I
— the incoming fundamental intensity. The stated approximation essentially
means that cascaded second-order processes and third-order nonlinearity do
not result in any tangible phase shifts.

Let’s show that the phase of the resulting wave Φ at the exit from the
dispersion interferometer depends on intensity. In the simplest case, when
one can neglect the group velocity dispersion, beam walk-oﬀ eﬀect and use
exact phase matching approximation ∆k = 0, amplitudes a(2ω)

Expressions (3) holds true while there is no initial second harmonics in the

orthogonal orientation of the crystals. Behind polarizer 5, the waves interfere

ﬁg. 1b.

In ﬁg. 2, we see the dependence of ∆ΦNL and I2ω/I upon the relative
phase (φ2 −
φ1). The nonlinear phase shift can be either positive (leading to
beam self-defocusing), or negative (self-focusing), depending on (φ2 −
φ1). It
πn, however
is easily seen that the maximum shift is produced at φ2 −
the SH output in contrast to it is at minimum, despite of nearly 100% second-
harmonic generation eﬃciency at the given exciting intensity. The reason is
that only a part of SH radiation passes through the polarizer, namely, the
component which has the nonlinear phase shift. Of course, the phase of the
fundamental wave in this scheme is not dependent of the intensity.

φ1 ≈

To obtain a nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental wave we can suggest
as an example a scheme similar to a polarizing interferometer with the use
of frequency doublers. The mechanism of the nonlinear phase shift here is
analogous to that of the dispersion interferometer, namely, due to the inter-
ference of the waves with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio. The scheme
diagram is shown in ﬁg. 3a. The interferometer consists of frequency doubler
1 where type I phase matching occurs, polarization-sensitive phase element
2, ﬁlter 3 which cuts of SH, and polarizer 4 (or polarizing beam-splitter).

We are interested in phase of the fundamental wave at the exit from
the interferometer. Assume the incident wave is linearly polarized and has
intensity I.
Inside the crystal there will be an ordinary wave of intensity

4

I cos2 ξ and extraordinary wave of intensity I sin2 ξ, where ξ is the angle
between the incident polarization and the polarization of the ordinary wave.
After the polarizer, which is oriented at 450 with respect to the ordinary wave,
there will be interference between a fraction of the extraordinary wave and
the corresponding fraction of the ordinary one. Their amplitudes we denote
as aω
2 , correspondly. Provided that there is type I phase matching, the
generation of SH will decrease the amplitude of only one of the fundamental
waves. Let’s assume, for certainty, the ordinary wave is partially converted
into the extraordinary wave of SH, and the other fundamental wave (losses
neglected) does not vary in intensity. Obviously, the amplitude ratio of the
fundamental waves will depend on the input intensity:

(6)

Expanding (1) with the expression given by (6) we will have the depen-

dence of the resulting wave phase Φ upon intensity.

The dependence of the nonlinear phase shift of fundamental wave on the
incident intensity is demonstrated in ﬁg. 3b, as well as the dependence of
output intensity on the incident one.

In the scheme shown in ﬁg. 3a, the nonlinear distortion of the fundamental
beam in the output of interferometer (focusing or defocusing) also takes place,
which can be controlled by variation of relative phase. The latter is changed
by a polarization-sensitive phase element, in this case.

As well as cascaded processes, the described mechanism of ultrafast non-
linearity produces a nonlinear phase shift of a wave without changing refrac-
tive index of a medium. These mechanisms of nonlinearity have, essentially,
the similar nature. Indeed, NPS occurring at cascading of quadratic processes
actually arises from the interference of the incoming fundamental wave and
the wave downconverted with a shifted phase from second harmonics. The
diﬀerence is in the way the interfering waves are produced.

As an analogue to the nonlinear coeﬃcient n2 for cubic nonlinearity, in
parallel with second-order cascaded processes, one can introduce the eﬀective
refractive index neﬀ
2 = ∆ΦNLc/ωlI for the ”interference” mechanism (two-
wave interference with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio). We compare

We have demonstrated a new method for obtaining fast nonlinear shift.
The eﬀect has a simple and intuitive interpretation, and is related to in-
terference of two waves with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio caused by
second harmonic generation. Sign and value of the nonlinear phase shift is
given by the relative phase of the waves introduced by phase element. The
eﬀect of ”interference” nonlinear phase shift has properties similar to those
of the nonlinear phase shift caused by cascaded second-order processes and
has several times higher neﬀ
then the latter. Furthermore, this eﬀect allows
2
producing NPS both of the fundamental and second-harmonic waves.

It worth noting the following features of described technique. As we can
see in ﬁg. 3b, the output intensity weakly depends on the input one within
a rather wide region. This property seems to be attractive for pulsations
damping. The strong dependence of ∆ΦN L upon the relative phase near the
φ1
point π (for instance, in ﬁg. 2 ∆ΦN L changes from 0.95π to
varies within π/25) can be potentially useful for dispersion interferometry of
nonlinear optical media [10, 11].

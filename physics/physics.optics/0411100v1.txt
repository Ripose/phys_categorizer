Abstract— We present a method for remote interrogation of
passive ﬁber Bragg grating Fabry-Perot resonators, employing
current modulation of the diode laser source. With the presence
of both RF amplitude and frequency modulation, it is a variant
of the ultra-sensitive Pound-Drever-Hall laser frequency locking
technique. We demonstrate that current modulation and interfer-
ometric demodulation removes the need for a phase modulator
in the sensing architecture.

sensing, ﬁber resonator.

T HE Pound-Drever-Hall frequency (PDH) locking tech-

nique [1], [2] is widely used in the gravitational wave
detection community for a range of applications, including
laser frequency stabilization [3], interferometer longitudinal
and alignment control, as well as gravitational wave signal
extraction [4], [5]. PDH locking is the method of choice for
ultra-sensitive interferometry. While it is well-established with
free-space bulk-optical resonators and solid-state lasers, it can
be readily extended to diode laser stabilization and guided-
wave optics. In ﬁber optics, Erbium doped ﬁber laser fre-
quency stabilization using PDH locking has been demonstrated
[6].

We have recently shown that the PDH technique can also
be used for signal extraction in a ﬁber Bragg grating Fabry-
Perot (FFP) sensor, achieving frequency noise performance
compatible with pico-strain resolution [7]. This is an extremely
powerful technique for both static and dynamic strain sensing
because the PDH system is immune to laser intensity noise to
the ﬁrst order when the laser is locked to a resonator.

In this Letter we present results for a modiﬁed PDH
locking technique, where we generate RF sidebands by directly
modulating the drive current of the interrogating laser. We
compare its ﬁber sensing performance with that obtained using
pure phase modulation (PM). Direct current modulation has
the advantage of removing the need for a phase modulator in
the sensing architecture. This offers a signiﬁcant cost saving
and simpliﬁes the packaging of the sensing system.

Current modulation of a diode laser introduces both am-
plitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).
This can change the symmetry and zero-crossing of the
demodulated error signal. For small modulation depths, the

while β is its PM equivalent; and α, δ and β are all ≪ 1. We
can see from equation 1 that the incident ﬁeld in the presence
of both AM and FM can be represented by a carrier with two
sidebands of unequal amplitudes. When α = β, the input ﬁeld
becomes the special case for single sideband modulation [8].
The current modulated laser is used to interrogate an FFP,
while measuring either the reﬂected or transmitted power with
a photodetector. We derive the demodulated and low-pass

Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) illustrate the demodulated error signals
for reﬂection and transmission respectively, using equation 2,
for various demodulation phase ∆ψ in 15o steps. We have
assumed that the grating pair which make up the FFP are of
equal reﬂectivity, and the single pass loss in the resonator is
1% of the circulating power. The FFP resonance linewidth
used for the calculations is 150MHz, while the current mod-
ulation frequency is 15MHz. The β:α ratio assumed in the
plots is 50:1.

It can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that the error signals differ
from classic PDH error signals in two ways. They have a DC
offset when the laser carrier is off-resonance because of the
unequal amplitudes of the sidebands. Also, there is a slight
deviation from the anti-symmetric shape of a classic PDH
error signal. The zero-crossing in the error signals, however,
are very close to resonance, which is the same as PDH error
signals with pure phase modulation. The zero-crossing can be
expected to intersect exactly on resonance when the FFP is
impedance matched, ie, the two reﬂectors are matched and
the FFP is lossless. In an impedance matched resonator, no
light is reﬂected on resonance, implying that ˜F (ν) = 0, and
hence equation 2 becomes zero.

Fig. 1(b), on the other hand, shows that transmitted error
signals tend to zero off-resonance, because there is very little
carrier or sideband transmitted outside resonance. When the
laser is near resonance, the transmitted error signals exhibit
even more pronounced asymmetry compared to the reﬂection
case. For both cases, this asymmetry is enhanced as the AM
the β:α ratio
component of the modulation increases,
decreases. More importantly, in transmission the zero-crossing
in the error signal is detuned slightly from the FFP resonance,
where the amount of detuning depends on the demodulation
phase ∆ψ. For a given resonator linewidth and modulation
frequency, this detuning is greater as the β:α ratio is reduced.

while Tx is for the transmission.

This implies that in frequency locking applications that
require the laser to be locked to line-center, for maximum
circulating and transmitted power, reﬂection locking is the
preferred mode of operation. As for sensing purposes, the
exact lock point relative to resonance center is less crucial,
provided the slope of the error signal around the lock point
is sufﬁciently linear. Thus either reﬂection or transmission

modes can be utilized, depending on the preferred sensing
architecture.

The experimental setup for the current RF modulated in-
terrogation scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2. The laser was a
New Focus Vortex 6029, which is a tunable extra-cavity diode
laser centered at 1550.15nm, with about 0.40nm, or ∼50GHz
tuning range. The frequency tuning of the laser was actuated
by applying a voltage to the piezo-electric transducer (PZT) of
its cavity. Our FFP consisted of a pair of nominally matched
13.5dB Bragg gratings (R ≈ 95.5%) each 15mm long, spaced
10mm apart. The selected resonance for this study had a
linewidth of approximately 143MHz. The current modulation
was driven by an RF signal generator at 15MHz, which also
provided the local oscillator for the demodulation electronics.
The local oscillator was phase shifted by ∆ψ before being used
to mix down the electronic signal from either the reﬂected or
transmitted port. This mixed output was then low-pass ﬁltered
to provide the demodulated error signal.

The experimental current modulation error signal traces for (a)
reﬂection, and (b) transmission as the laser frequency was swept through
the resonance of a ﬁber Fabry-Perot. Each shows overlaid error signals for
several RF phase shifts ∆ψ.

To observe the error signals in the presence of both AM
and FM, the frequency of the laser was scanned by applying
a 50:50 sawtooth from a function generator. The error signals
were recorded with a digital oscilloscope and displayed in Fig.
3. Fig. 3a plots the family of reﬂected error signals as the RF
phase shift ∆ψ was varied. They show only slight asymmetry
with differing off-resonance DC offset, as predicted by Fig.
1a. It can be seen that they intersect very near zero-crossing,
as our FFP was nearly impedance matched.

Similarly, Fig. 3b presents the error signals in transmission.
As predicted in Fig. 1b, the off-resonance DC offset seen in
reﬂection was absent in the transmission scans, and their asym-
metry was stronger compared with the former. The agreement
in the amount of asymmetry between the experimental and
theoretical error signals, as well as the small amount of zero-
crossing detuning in transmission, would indicate that current
modulation in our laser is dominated by PM, and the β:α ratio
is ≃ 50.

To lock the laser to the FFP resonance, we ﬁrst selected the
largest error signal available in the transmission (see Fig. 3b)
by adjusting ∆ψ, after which the sawtooth to the PZT was
replaced with the amplifed error signal. Before the feedback

loop was closed, the PZT DC offset voltage was tuned slowly
while the transmitted and reﬂected laser intensities were
monitored. When the laser nears resonance, the transmitted
intensity approaches its maximum, and the feedback loop was
then engaged to acquire lock. This process was recorded with
a digital oscilloscope, and the traces are illustrated in Fig.
4. The servo ampliﬁer used in this experiment had a single
real pole response with a corner frequency of 0.03Hz. The
total feedback loop had a DC gain of ≈1000 and a unity gain
bandwidth of around 40Hz. Lock aquisition was both straight
forward and robust. Like the traditional PDH interrogation
method, once locked, the laser typically stayed locked for over
3 hours [7]. This duration is limited by the long term FFP
thermal drift.

The signal extraction from an FFP sensor, when interrogated
with a current modulated laser, is similar to the PDH locking
scheme. This is done by either monitoring the PZT feedback
voltage required to maintain lock within the servo unity gain
bandwidth, or by monitoring the mixer output at frequencies
above the unity gain bandwidth. Environmental stimulations,
such as temperature drift as well as stress and strain due
to mechanical or acoustic perturbation, change the resonance
condition of the FFP. These result in both DC and AC voltage
change in the mixer output and the PZT feedback voltage.
When the mixer output is read with a dynamic signal analyzer,
frequency domain information about these perturbations can
be extracted. The signal analyzer performs a Fast Fourier
Transform of the time domain mixer output voltage (shown
in Fig. 4c), and when the slope of the error signal is used
for calibration, it provides a direct measurement of both the
frequency noise of the laser source and the dynamic strain in
the FFP.

We compared the performance of the FFP sensor when the
laser was purely phase modulated, with the case of current
is illustrated in Fig. 5, where we

that both methods showed the same components of audio

frequencies. The two modulation schemes yielded comparable
broadband sensitivities, with only a slight penalty in adopting
current modulation.

In summary, direct modulation of the drive current in our
diode laser introduces both AM and FM in its electric ﬁeld.
We derived the theoretical expression for the expected error
signals when an FFP is interrogated with a current modulated
diode laser, and they agreed well with experimental data.
We compared the current modulated sensing architecture with
that utilizing pure phase modulation, and found that they
had comparable sensitivities. This is an important result, as
it eliminates the need for a phase modulator in the sensing
topology, with little penalty in observed performance.

Abstract

The idea of working with a near-critical phase-separated liquid mixture whereby the surface

tension becomes weak, has revolutionized the ﬁeld of laser manipulation of liquid interfaces. The

deformation of interfaces may become as large as several tenths of micrometers, even with the

use of conventional laser power. This circumstance necessitates the use of nonlinear geometrical

theory for the description of surface deformations. The present paper works out such a theory,

for the surface deformation under conditions of axial symmetry and stationarity. Good agreement

is found with the experimental results of Casner and Delville (2001), in the case of moderate

power or a broad laser beam. In the case of large power and a narrow beam, corresponding to

surface deformations of about 50 micrometers or higher, the theory is found to over-predict the

deformation. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The formation, deformation, and breakup of ﬂuid interfaces are ubiquitous phenomena

in nature [1]. One special group of eﬀects which implies the so-called ﬁnite time singularity

[2], has as its most common example the breakup of pendant drops driven by gravity [3, 4].

If external ﬁelds such as electric or magnetic ﬁelds are present, one has in addition extra

control parameters. Thus we may mention that interface instabilities driven by electric ﬁelds

[5, 6] are important for many processes such as electro-spraying [7], ink-jet printing [8], or

surface-relief patterning [9]. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld can also be useful, for instance for

the purpose of of forming elongated magnetic droplets [10]. These deformations, as well as

those induced by the acoustic radiation pressure on liquid surfaces [11, 12], have been used

to explore the mechanical properties of ﬂuid interfaces in a non-contact way [13, 14].

It is noteworthy that laser-induced deformations of the interfaces of soft materials have

not received the same amount of interest in the past. Most attention has been given to test-

particle global eﬀects such as optical levitation and trapping - cf., for instance, Refs. [15,

16]. The reason for this circumstance is simple: deformations of ﬂuid interfaces by optical

radiation are ordinarily weak. For instance, in the classic experiment of Ashkin and Dziedzic

[17], a pulsed single transverse mode doubled Nd:YAG laser (20 pulses per second) was

focused vertically from above on a water surface. The wavelength of the incident wave was

λ0 = 0.53 µm, the peak power was Pmax = 3 kW (low enough to make nonlinear eﬀects

negligible), and the duration of each pulse was 60 ns. The beam radius at the waist was

reported to be very small, ω0 = 2.1 µm, but has most likely have been somewhat larger,

ω0 = 4.5 µm; cf. the dicussion in Ref. [18]. The rise of the water surface was small, about

0.9 µm, occurring at t

450 ns after the onset of the pulse. The physical reason for this small

≈

surface elevation is evidently the large surface tension σ =0.073 N/m between air and water.

[The theory of the Ashkin-Dziedzic experiment was worked out in Refs. [18, 19].] If we go

to the more recent experiment of Sakai et al. [20], we will ﬁnd that the surface displacement

was even more minute. In this case the displacement was induced by a continuous wave

(cw) Ar+ pump laser (wavelength in vacuum λ0 = 0.514 µm, maximum power Pmax=0.5

W), and was probed with a He-Ne laser. For a beam power P = 0.3 W and a beam waist

ω0 = 142 µm the elevation of the surface was found to be extremely small, about 2 nm.

Generally speaking it is of considerable interest to be able to probe the displacement

3

of ﬂuid interfaces in a non-contact way; especially this is so in biophysics. A major step

forward in the development of the ﬁeld was to recognize that on can reduce the surface

tension considerably by working with a phase-separated liquid mixture, close to the critical

point. In this way ”giant” deformations can be achieved. Recent experiments of Casner

and Delville have shown that the displacements can in this way reach several tenths of

micrometers [21–25] (cf. also the recent review [26]). Also, there are seen in the experiments

rather remarkable asymmetries with respect to the upward/downward direction of the laser

beam [25].

The giant deformations make it necessary to use to use nonlinear theory for the description

of the surface deﬂection. The purpose of the present paper is to present such a calculation, for

the typical case where the elevation is axially symmetric (a condition almost always satisﬁed

in practice), and in addition stationary. Comparison with the mentioned experiments will

be made. We shall moreover assume that the laser beam is incident from below only. The

mentioned up/down asymmetry will thus not be treated.

For completeness we emphasize that we are considering nonlinear theory only in a geo-

metrical sense, in order to describe the interface bulge. The electromagnetic theory as such

is kept on the conventional linear level, as we are only considering moderate laser intensities.

II. DERIVATION OF THE GOVERNING EQUATION

A. Basic electromagnetic theory

We begin by writing down the expression for the electromagnetic volume force density f

in an isotropic, nonconducting and nonmagnetic medium [18, 27]:

f =

(cid:18)
Here E and H are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, ρ is the mass density of the medium

(cid:19)S(cid:21)

(1)

(ﬂuid), ε is the permittivity, and κ = ε/ε0 is the relative permittivity where ε0 denotes the

permittivity of vacuum.

Let us comment on the various terms in Eq. (1), beginning with the last term. This

term is called the Abraham term, since it follows from Abraham’s electromagnetic energy-

momentum tensor. The term is experimentally detectable under special circumstances at

4

low frequencies [18], but not at optical frequencies, at least not under usual stationary

conditions. The Abraham term simply ﬂuctuates out.

The middle term in Eq. (1) is the electrostriction term. When seen from within the

optically denser medium (the medium with the highest n), the electrostriction force is always

compressive. Whether this kind of force is detectable in a static or a stationary case,

depends on whether the experiment is able to measure local pressure distributions within

the compressed region or not. Moreover, in a dynamic case the velocity of sound is an

important factor. If the elastic pressure in the ﬂuid has suﬃcient time to build up, then

the electrostriction force will not be detectable when measuring the gross behavior of a ﬂuid

such as the elevation of its surface. Such is usually the case in optics. The time required

for the counterbalance to take place, is of the same order of magnitude as the time needed

for sound waves to traverse the cross section of the laser beam. For a beam width around

10 µm, this yields a time scale for counterbalance of the order of 10 ns. For instance, in the

Ashkin-Dziedzic experiment [17] a detailed calculation veriﬁes this time scale; cf. Fig. 9 in

[18].

Another point worth mentioning in connection with the electrostriction term is that that

we have written (∂ε/∂ρ)S as an adiabatic partial derivative. This seems most natural in

optical problems in view of the rapid variations of the ﬁeld, at least in connection with laser

pulses. In many cases it is however legitimate to assume that the medium is nonpolar, so

that we need not distinguish between adiabatic and isothermal derivatives. The permittivity

depends on the mass density only. Then derivative can be written simply as dε/dρ, and is

calculable from the Clausius-Mossotti relation.

In this way we can write Eq. (1) in the

following form, when omitting the last term,

f =

1

ε0E2

κ +

∇

1
6

ε0∇

E2(κ

1)(κ + 2)

.

−

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

Finally, we have the ﬁrst term in Eq. (1), which may be called the Abraham-Minkowski

force, since it follows equally well from the Abraham and the Minkowski energy-momentum

tensors:

f AM =

1
2

−

ε0E2

κ.

∇

This is the only term that we have to take into account in practice in optics, under usual

circumstances. We see that this force is equal to zero in the homogeneous interior of the

medium, and acts in the inhomogeneous boundary region only. By integrating the normal

(2)

(3)

5

component of the Abraham-Minkowski force density across the boundary, we obtain the sur-

face force density which can alternatively be evaluated as the jump of the normal component

of the electromagnetic Maxwell stress tensor.

In the following we focus attention the force term in Eq. (3) only.

B. Surface tension and radiation forces on a curved surface

Let us assume that there is established a stationary curved surface z = h(x, y) distin-

guishing two ﬂuids, a lower ﬂuid (1) and an upper ﬂuid (2), the equilibrium position being

determined by the balance of gravity, surface tension, and radiation pressure. The undis-

turbed position of the surface is the xy plane. Because of the surface tension coeﬃcient σ,

there will be a normal stress proportional to the mean curvature of the surface:

p2 −

p1 = σ

R1

R2 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)
R1 and R2 being the principal radii of curvature at the surface point considered. If R1 and
R2 are positive, p2 −
surface is convex. It is useful to have in mind the following general formula for the mean

p1 > 0. This means that the pressure is greater in the medium whose

curvature 1/R1 + 1/R2:

where hx = ∂h/∂x, etc. Our convention is such that the curvature is positive if the surface

is concave upwards. Also, we note that the unit normal vector n to the surface is

n = (1 + h2

Assume now that there is a monochromatic electromagnetic wave with electric ﬁeld vector

iωt incident from below, in the positive z direction. The direction of the incident

wave vector ki is thus given by the unit vector

(4)

(5)

in medium 1. When this wave impinges upon the surface, it becomes separated into a
transmitted wave E(t) and a reﬂected wave E(r), propagating in the directions of ˆkt and ˆkr,

ˆki = (0, 0, 1)

6

respectively. We assume, in conformity with usual practice, that the waves can locally be

regarded as plane waves and that the surface can locally be regarded as plane. The plane of
incidence is formed by the vectors ˆki and n; we call the angle of incidence θi and the angle
be the components of E parallel
of transmission θt. See Fig. 1. Moreover, we let E

and E

and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, respectively. The expressions for the energy

Consider now the electromagnetic surface force density, which we will call Π. As mentioned

above, Π can be found by integrating the normal component of the volume force density

across the surface boundary layer. From Eq. (3) it follows that the surface force acts normal

to the surface, and that it is directed towards the optically thinner medium.

to n, and the force acts downward, normal to the surface.

C. Cylindrical symmetry

We henceforth assume cylindrical symmetry, using standard cylinder coordinates (r, θ, z).

There is no variation in the azimuthal direction, ∂h/∂θ = 0. With the notation hr = ∂h/∂r

we have

When the surface is horizontal, hr = 0, we have f = 1, and Π reduces to the expression

(16).

A peculiar property of the expression (20) facilitating practical calculations is that it is

quite insensitive with respect to variations in the polarization angle α, especially in the case

8

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

when a is close to unity, which is in practice most important. Thus if we draw curves for

Π(θi) versus θi for various input values of α in the whole region 0 < α < 90o (not shown

here), we will ﬁnd that the curves lie close to each other. For practical calculations involving

unpolarized light it is thus legitimate to replace f (hr, α) by its average with respect to α.

As

This expression is valid also in the case of hydrodynamic nonlinearity. Note again that

Π is the normally-directed force per unit area of the oblique liquid surface.

Finally, let us consider the force balance for the liquid column, assuming stationary

conditions. When n2 > n1 the surface tension force which acts upward, has to balance

the combined eﬀect of gravity and electromagnetic surface force, which both act downward.

When the surface is given as h = h(r, θ), the mean curvature can be written as

and the force balance becomes

= Π(r).

This equation follows from considering the equilibrium of a liquid column having unit base

area. Here Π(r) is the pressure scalar, i.e., Π(r) = Π(r)n. Thus Π(r) < 0.

What expression to insert for Π(r) in Eq. (24), depends on the physical circumstances.

Thus in the case of an unpolarized laser beam, we may use either the expression (14) with

R =

III. SOLUTION OF THE NONLINEAR EQUATION

It is advantageous to introduce nondimensional variables. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the capillary

length lC and the Bond number B,

lC =

σ
(ρ1 −

r

ρ2)g

, B =

2

,

ω0
lC (cid:19)

(cid:18)

ω0 being the radius of the beam waist. The Bond number describes the strength of buoy-

ancy relative to the Laplace force.

If B

1, gravity is much weaker than the Laplace

force. (The Bordeaux experiments covered the region 10−

3 < B < 4.) We then deﬁne the

≪

nondimensional radius R and the nondimensional height H(R) as

R =

, H(R) =

r
ω0

h(r)
lC

.

The fact that in practice a = n1/n2 is very close to one, makes it at ﬁrst sight possible to

simplify the right hand side of the governing equation. Namely, from Eq. (22) one would

expect that f (hr)

1. However, the situation is more delicate due to nonlinearity: if we

→

keep f (hr) in the formalism and calculate the elevation h(r), we will ﬁnd that f gets a

pronounced dip within the region where the beam is strong. Typically, if we draw a curve

for f = f (R) versus the nondimensional radius R, we will see that f drops from 1 to about

0.3 when R lies about 0.5. Mathematically, this is because the high steepness of the surface

makes hr (or HR) large enough to inﬂuence f signiﬁcantly in a narrow region even when a

is close to unity. Assuming a Gaussian incident beam,

I(r) =

Typically, the deformations belong to the linear regime when P < 200 mW and to the

nonlinear regime when P > 300 mW, although this distinction of course depends also on

the speciﬁc values of ω0 and T

corresponds to centerline deformations (r = 0) less than about 20 µm. From Refs. [22, 23]

we recall that in the linear regime we have the following simple formula for the centerline

height hlin(r) (here in physical variables):

TC and

−

ω0. In each ﬁgure, nonlinear eﬀects are included. First, Fig. 2 shows how h(r) varies with r

when T

TC = 2.5 K and ω0 = 4.8 µm. According to Eqs. (35), (26) this corresponds to

−

lC=20.3 µm, B=0.0560. The powers are P =

300, 600, 1200

mW. In practice, the choice

{

}

Re = 9 turned out be large enough to serve as outer boundary condition. Because of the

cylindrical symmetry, only one half of the displacements (r > 0 in the ﬁgure) need to be

shown. It is seen that both powers 600 mW and 1200 mW lead to nonlinear eﬀects. The

theoretical deﬂections for the three given values of the power are read oﬀ from the ﬁgure to

be

12, 56, 112

µm, respectively.

{
Our choice of input parameters makes the ﬁgure directly comparable to Fig. 6.1 in Cas-

}

ner’s thesis [21]. The experimental centerline displacements estimated from the photos are

about 10 µm for P = 300 mW, 45 µm for P = 600 mW, and 75 µm for P = 1200 mW. The

theoretical predictions are thus in this case larger than the observed ones, especially for the

highest value of P . Moreover, one diﬀerence which is most noticeable is the absence of the

observed ”shoulder” in the theoretical solution in the case of large P . The shoulder occurs

experimentally when the laser illumination is from below. There is at present no theory

capable of describing this phenomenon. Mathematically, the establishment of the shoulder

seems to be related to an instability; the real deﬂection jumps from one class of solutions

13

of the nonlinear diﬀerential equation to another class. Video records actually show ”jumps”

in the surface when it gets formed, thus supporting our conjecture about an instability phe-

nomenon. As for the observed width of the surface displacement, there is good agreement

with the theoretical prediction.

Fig. 3 shows analogous results for the case T

TC = 2.5 K, ω0 = 8.9 µm, thus a consid-

−

erably broader beam. Here lC =20.3 µm, B = 0.193. The powers are P =

}
mW. In this case, the value Re = 7 was found to be suﬃcient. Our results can be compared

360, 600, 890

{

with Fig. 6.3 in Casner’s thesis. The theoretical centerline displacements for the three men-

tioned cases of P are

10, 19, 47

µm, which all agree well with the observed values. Also

{

}

in this case there occurs a shoulder experimentally, but it is not so pronounced as in the

previous case.

Finally, in Fig. 4 we show the case T

TC = 3 K, ω0 = 5.3 µm, corresponding to lC=22.1

µm, B = 0.0576, for powers P =

300, 590, 830

mW. Again, the outer nondimensional

−

{

}

radius Re = 9 was found to be appropriate. The theoretical centerline deﬂections are now

seen from the ﬁgure to be

10, 39, 65

µm, respectively, for the given values of P . We

{

}

may compare this with the photos shown in Fig. 2 in Ref. [25] or Fig. VI.5 in [26]: the

corresponding experimental dispacements are about

10, 40, 55

µm. Also this time we see

{

}

that the agreement between theory and experiment is good for low powers, but that the

theory over-predicts the displacement when the power gets large. The last-mentioned eﬀect

is generally most pronounced when the radius of the laser beam is small.

IV. SUMMARY, AND FINAL REMARKS

The ”giant” deformations of ﬂuid interfaces recently obtained in the experiments of Cas-

ner and Delville [21–26] with the use of moderate laser beam powers P (P typically lying

between 500 and 1000 mW) have accentuated the need of taking into account nonlinear

geometrical eﬀects in the theoretical description of the interface deformation. As a rule of

thumb, the nonlinear geometrical eﬀects turn up when the deformations become larger than

about 20 µm. When the radius ω0 of the laser beam is small, typically ω

5 µm, a power

∼

P

1 watt may easily lead to deﬂections around 100 µm. The physical reason for the

∼

occurrence of giant deformations is the lowering of surface tension caused by working with

a phase-separated liquid mixture close to the critical point.

14

The nonlinear governing equation in nondimensional form can be taken as in Eq. (29)

or, what was found more convenient, as in Eq. (36) where G = HR/K is considered as the

dependent variable. We solved the set of equations (39)-(41) numerically. As a consistency

check, we made also an analogous calculation starting from Eq. (29), and got the same

results. Figures 2-4 show some examples of our calculations; these are all directly comparable

with the Casner-Delville experiment.

Some general conclusions that can be made from our calculations, are the following:

1. For given values of T

TC and ω0, a larger P causes a larger deformation.

2. For a given T

TC, a smaller ω0 causes a larger and narrower deformation.

TC causes a larger and narrower deformation.

4. Very large beam waists (ω0 ∼
−
not even for the largest P and smallest T

20

30 µm) are not able to cause a nonlinear deformation,

TC investigated in the Casner-Delville experiment.

5. For small T

TC and small ω0 (for instance T

TC = 2.5 K and ω0 = 4.5 µm), a power

−

−

of 300 mW is not enough to cause a nonlinear deformation. However, a further decrease

in temperature, such as to the value T

TC=1.5 K, will take also the 300 mW-induced

−

−

deformation into the nonlinear regime.

All the items listed above are expected on physical grounds. A large incident power

concentrated on a narrow cross section means a large electromagnetic ﬁeld intensity and

thus a large surface force. The enhanced deformation for small T

TC is due to the fact

that the restoring buoyancy force (

∆ρ) and Laplace force (

σ) vanish at T = TC ; cf.

−

∼

Eqs. (32) and (33).

∼

Concretely, when comparing our results with the Casner-Delville observations, we ﬁnd

that for broad beams the agreement between theory and experiment is quite good; cf. our

discussion of Fig. 3 above. There is however a considerable theoretical over-prediction of the

deﬂection in the case of narrow beams and high powers. Most strikingly, this is shown in the

case ω0=4.8 µm, P =1200 mW, as discussed in connection with Fig. 2. The physical reason

for this discrepancy is not known. It may be related to the production of heat in the liquid

in the presence of the strong ﬁeld, or to the loss of radiation energy because of scattering

from the non-avoidable corrugations on the liquid interface. Perhaps the most intriguing

possibility is that the discrepancy is related to the reﬂection of radiation energy from the

interface ”shoulder”, which is seen to be produced in strong ﬁelds when the illumination is

from below. This eﬀect is most likely related to an instability; the system decides to switch

15

from one class of solutions of the nonlinear governing equation to another class. To our

knowledge, no explanation exists of this eﬀect.

We mention ﬁnally that the theory for linear deformations has been worked out before

[18, 19, 22, 23]. The analytic solution for the deﬂection of the surface is reproduced in

Eq. (47).

Abstract

The modal formalism is developed to deal with index-modulated structures ended by anisotropic

regions (perfectly matched layers, PML). The method is applicable to scattering problems from

dielectric or metallic objects as well as to propagation in planar slab waveguides. The boundary-

value problem is solved and the dispersion relation inside the PML is derived. The general ex-

pression of the eigenvalues equation for an arbitrary number of regions and for both polarization

modes is obtained. The modal functions of a layer ended by PMLs are found, and their orthog-

onality relation is derived. The potential of the method to deal with more general problems is

brieﬂy outlined.

Introduction

The perfectly matched layer (PML) is a ﬁctitious material which does not reﬂect incident prop-

agating waves regardless of the incident angle, frequency and polarization. It was ﬁrstly intro-

duced by Berenger [1, 2] as a useful absorbing boundary condition to truncate the computational

domain in ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain applications. A diﬀerent formulation of the PML, given

by Sacks et al. [3], is based on exploiting constitutive characteristics of anisotropic materials to

provide a reﬂectionless interface. This formulation oﬀers the special advantage that it does not

require modiﬁcation of Maxwell equations [3]. Both formulations of the PML are very popular

among the electrical engineering community and their use in the optics community has been

growing in the last few years [4]-[8]. PMLs look attractive, mainly because of their potential

capacity to simulate open-structure problems by bounded computational domains, which conse-

quently reduce signiﬁcantly the computational costs involved in the calculations. Even though

this kind of medium is usually used in the framework of ﬁnite-element methods [9]-[11], there

are also studies which incorporate the anisotropic absorber in diﬀerent approaches [7], [12]-[14].

In particular, the modal approach appears as an interesting alternative for the description of

the ﬁelds in index-modulated structures since it highlights the physics of the problem.

The modal approach has been applied by many authors to dielectric lamellar gratings in classical

[15]-[17] as well as in conical mounting [18, 19].

In his work, Li [19] derived rigorously the

eigenfunctions and also their completeness and ortogonality relations from the boundary-value

problem. Later on, this formalism was extended to deal with multiply grooved lamellar gratings

[20], where the eigenvalues equation for an arbitrary number of diﬀerent dielectric zones was

obtained and carefully analyzed for real and complex refraction indices. The modal formulation

presented in [20] was then extended to deal with ﬁnite structures such as index-modulated

apertures [21].

A further step on the development of the modal method was the application of the multilayer

approximation [16] not only to inﬁnite gratings [22] but also to ﬁnite structures with arbitrary

shapes of the corrugations [23]-[25]. However, all these works were restricted to structures

laterally closed by perfect conductors.

If illuminated by ﬁnite beams, these structures can

approximately simulate the scattering from purely dielectric ﬁnite structures [21], [23]-[25].

It is well known that either the pseudeperiodic condition in inﬁnite gratings or the assumption

2

of perfect conductivity in ﬁnite structures forces the eigenvalues set to be discrete. On the

other hand, open problems like propagation in dielectric waveguides or scattering from dielectric

objects in open space, have a continuum set of eigenvalues. Therefore, it is allways convenient

to limit the problem domain, in order to avoid large volumes of calculus. This can be done

by means of perfectly matched layers, which ensure absorption and attenuation of the incident

radiation and consequently simulate the open space better.

The purpose of this paper is to ﬁnd the analytical expressions of the eigenmodes of an index-

modulated layer ended by PMLs at both sides, and to derive the relations that satisfy the set of

eigenfunctions. We cover simultaneously the scattering problem of an index-modulated aperture

(schematized in Fig. 1a) as well as the propagation problem in a planar slab waveguide (Fig. 1b),

since both problems have an equivalent formulation. With this work we also set the basis for the

application of the modal formalism to more complex structures, such as dielectric waveguides

of arbitrary cross section and apertures with corrugations of arbitrary shape, by means of the

multilayer approximation [16] and the R-matrix propagation algorithm [6, 7, 22][26]-[28].

2 Modal formulation

In this section we develop a rigorous method to ﬁnd the exact modes of a structure as that of

Fig. 2. The modes of such a structure can be then applied to ﬁnd the solution of waveguide

problems and scattering problems.

Consider an index-modulated layer invariant in the ˆz direction, as shown in Fig. 2. Each

homogeneous zone xj ≤ x ≤ xj + ∆j of width ∆j has a permittivity ǫj and a permeability µj,

where ǫj and µj can be complex numbers. The layer is ended at both sides by perfectly matched

layers backed by perfect conductors. The PML is a particular anisotropic medium especially

designed to absorb the received radiation [3], and its constitutive parameters are ˜ǫPML = ǫ˜Λ and

˜µPML = µ ˜Λ where ǫ and µ are the permittivity and permeability of the adjacent isotropic zone,

respectively. For an interface parallel to the (y, z)-plane, the tensor ˜Λ must be deﬁned as:

The parameter b is a complex number:

its real part is related to the wavelength inside the

PML, and the imaginary part accounts for the losses in the material, i.e., the attenuation of the

propagating waves.

As stated above, to ﬁnd the eigenmodes of the structure depicted in Fig. 2 can be useful for

waveguide and scattering problems. We are interested in studying the propagation of plane

waves along the structure, and then a time dependence e−iωt (ω being the frequency of the

plane wave) is implied and suppressed in all the paper. Since the structure is invariant in the

z-direction, the problem can be separated into two scalar problems for Ez (TM polarization)

and Hz (TE polarization). Then, the x- and y- components of the ﬁelds can be written in terms

of the z-components [29].

Within the PML, Maxwell curl equations are

where c is the speed of light in vacuum and ~E and ~H are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds,

respectively. In the case of a slab waveguide (Fig. 1b), we are interested in ﬁnding the solu-

(2) and (3), and taking into account the invariance of the problem along the ˆz direction, we

get the propagation equations for a layer with x-dependent constitutive parameters, for both

polarization modes:

The eigenmodes of the structure are the set of linearly independent functions that satisfy by

themselves the boundary conditions at all the interfaces x = xj, j = 0, ..., N + 1, and form a

complete basis. In particular, since the layer is ended by a perfect conductor, we require that

the tangential component of the electric ﬁeld vanishes at x = x0 and at x = L. To do so, we ﬁrst

solve eq. (7) in each region (isotropic and anisotropic) and then match these partial solutions

correspondingly. For the most general case in which ∂y 6= 0 a separated solution is proposed:

ψ(x, y) = X(x).Y (y) ,

Y (y) = a cos(vy) + b sin(vy) ,

and we will now focus on the diﬀerential equation for X(x). Notice that for the scattering

problem γ2(x) = k2(x) − v2 and for the slab waveguide problem γ2(x) = k2(x) − k2

z . Then, we

can unify both cases by setting ρ = v2 in the ﬁrst case and ρ = k2

z in the second case.

Eq. (11) together with the boundary conditions at the ends of the layer (x = x0 and x = L)

Since b is a complex number, the operator L is a non-self-adjoint operator [30]. From the theory

of non self-adjoint problems we know that the eigenvalues are inﬁnite and complex in general,

and the eigenfunctions do not necessarily form a complete and orthogonal set [30]. To ﬁnd a

useful solution to our problem, is then necessary to consider the adjoint problem of (13)

where the asterisk denotes complex conjugate and the † denotes adjoint. The eigenvalues of the

adjoint problem are the complex conjugates of those of the direct problem, i.e.,

and the sets of eigenfunctions {Xm(x)} and {X †

n) = δmn, where the internal product (Xm, X †

Taking into account these facts, we are going to ﬁnd the solutions of eq. (11). In each homoge-

neous region (j), we propose a solution of the form

Xj(x) = Aj cos[uj(x − xj)] + Bj sin[uj(x − xj)]

for the two kinds of zones we have in the structure: isotropic (bj = 1) and anisotropic (bj ∈ C,

bj 6= 1). Notice that ρ is a constant for each eigenmode, and the constitutive parameters of
the PML satisfy ˜ǫ0 = ǫ1 ˜Λ, ˜µ0 = µ1 ˜Λ, and then k2

1. The same occurs at the other end of

0 = k2

the layer, and therefore, u0 = b u1 and uN = b uN −1, i.e., the eigenvalue in the PML region is

b times the eigenvalue in the adjacent isotropic region. Then, the solution of eq. (11) in the

whole layer can be expressed in terms of harmonic functions, where the amplitudes are such that

satisfy the boundary conditions at the vertical interfaces, and the eigenvalues u and ρ satisfy

the corresponding dispersion relation, depending on the zone (eq. (20)). Deﬁning ˜X(x) as:

[−Bj cos [uj(x − xj)] + Aj sin [uj(x − xj)]]

for xj < x < xj + ∆j

(21)

˜X(x) =

it is easy to verify that [21]:

X(x) = X(xj) cos(uj(x − xj)) −

˜X(xj) sin(uj(x − xj)) ,

for xj < x < xj + ∆j

˜X(x) = ˜X(xj) cos(uj(x − xj)) +

X(xj ) sin(uj(x − xj)) ,

for xj < x < xj + ∆j .(22)

expressed in matrix form as:

Equations (22) provide us with a relation between two ﬁeld quantities at both sides of each

homogeneous zone bounded by the interfaces at x = xj and x = xj + ∆j. This relation can be

X(x) and ˜X(x) represent vectors containing the modal functions Xm(x) and ˜Xm(x), respectively,

and u and ρ are related by the dispersion relation. The subscript m denoting the mode has been

suppressed as it is understood that relations (22)-(24) hold for each one of the modal terms.

This procedure can be applied N times to get a relation between the ﬁelds at the perfectly

conducting walls at x = x0 and x = xL. In such a case we have a relation of the form:



X(xL)

˜X(xL)


where ˜M(ρ) is a product matrix:

˜M(ρ) = ML(ρ) ML−1(ρ) . . . M2(ρ) M1(ρ) .

˜M(ρ) is a 2 × 2 block matrix. This is a well known result from the theory of stratiﬁed media

[31].

Imposition of the boundary condition at x0 and at xL, i.e., the tangential component of the

electric ﬁeld must vanish on the surface, yields a condition on the non-diagonal block elements:

˜M12(ρ) = 0

for TM polarization

˜M21(ρ) = 0

for TE polarization .

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

These conditions determine eigenvalues equations for ρ, that must be solved by means of numer-

ical techniques. These equations have already been studied for structures formed by isotropic

regions in the case of an inﬁnite periodic grating [20] and of an index-modulated aperture [21, 24].

The expressions of the equations found in this work reduce to those in Refs. [21, 24] for b = 1.

Finally, the eigenmodes of the layer bounded by perfectly matched layers backed by perfectly

conducting walls are given by

Xm(x, y) = Amj cos[umj(x − xj)] + Bmj sin[umj(x − xj)]

for xj < x < xj + ∆j

,

(29)

where umj satisfy the corresponding eigenvalues equation (27) or (28). The modal coeﬃcients

9

Amj and Bmj are easily obtained by successive application of eqs. (22)

Amj = Am,j−1 cos[um,j−1(xj − xj−1)] + Bm,j−1 sin[um,j−1(xj − xj−1)]

3 Examples

As a ﬁrst example, we consider the case of a symmetric structure formed by three zones (PML

- dielectric - PML) of widths ∆P and ∆1, and then u0 = u2 = uP . This example actually

simulates the open space, and can be useful to study the coupling between a slab waveguide and

open space [14]. For this case, the direct application of the procedure described in the previous

section yields an eigenvalues equation for both polarization modes, that after some manipulation

can be reduced to:

sin(2uP ∆P + u1∆1) = 0 .

Taking into account that uP = u1b, the solutions of eq. (31) are

u1m =

mπ
2 b ∆P + ∆1

,

for m integer.

(31)

(32)

The eigenvalues obtained in (32) are the same as those found by Derudder et al. by means of a

coordinates transformation in the propagation equation (eqs. (16) and (17) in Ref. [14]).

Considering a structure formed by ﬁve zones can be useful to study planar slab waveguides.

Successive application of matrix products of eq.

(26) yields a complex eigenvalues equation

involving products of trigonometric functions. In the particular case with ∆1 = ∆3 and µj =

µ0∀j, the explicit expressions of the eigenvalues equations for TM and TE modes are shown in the

Appendix. As it can be observed in Fig. 3 for TM polarization, the solutions of the equation

are coincident with those obtained from ecs. (24) and (25) in Ref.

[14]. As the number of

homogeneous regions in the layer is increased, the eigenvalues equation becomes more complex,

and consequently, it is more diﬃcult to ﬁnd its solutions. Each equation requires special analysis

and appropriate numerical algorithms to be solved successfully.

As it has been stated above, any system of planar regions can be studied by this method.

However, if we take into account that any proﬁle can be approximated by a stack of rectangular

layers (multilayer approximation) [16], the scope of applicability of the modal method broadens

signiﬁcantly. Since we already found the exact expression of the ﬁeld in terms of the eigenmodes

of a rectangular layer, to apply the method to a multilayer system is straightforward, by means

of any propagation algorithm such as the R-matrix [22]. For instance, this method could deal

with scattering problems from objects of arbitrary shape and propagation in two-dimensional

waveguides such as optical ﬁbers of arbitrary cross section.

4 Summary and conclusions

I presented an extension of the modal method, to be able to deal with layers ended by par-

ticular anisotropic regions (perfectly matched layers). The general method was described for

an arbitrary number of regions of diﬀerent widths in the structure. A complete set of modal

functions was obtained, and also the ortonormality relation between them. Simple examples

of eigenvalues equations for planar slab waveguides have been presented, and the results have

been compared with those of another method. The present method is a basic tool that can be

applied to more general problems such as propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross section

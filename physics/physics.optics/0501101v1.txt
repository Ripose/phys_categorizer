Abstract

In a recently published paper (J. of Modern Optics 50 (9) (2003) 1477-1486) a
qualitative analysis of the moir´e eﬀect observed by superposing two grids containing
Cantor fractal structures was presented. It was shown that the moir´e eﬀect is sensible
to variations in the order of growth, dimension and lacunarity of the Cantor fractal.
It was also veriﬁed that self-similarity of the original fractal is inherited by the moir´e
pattern.

In this work it is shown that these Cantor moir´e structures are also fractals
and the fractal dimension associated with them is theoretically determined and
experimentally measured attending the size of rhombuses in the diﬀerent orders of
growth.

scribed by using a fractal approach [1]. B. B. Mandelbrot introduced the term
fractal, which comes from the Latin fractus meaning broken, to describe ir-
regular structures which are impossible to study using traditional Euclidean
geometry. As he suggested, the principal characteristic of these new structures
is their self-similarity: they are invariant under change of scale and displace-
ment. A fractal is a set whose parts resemble the whole. This self-similarity
can be mathematical or statistical. In the ﬁrst case exact copies of the whole
are obtained when the structure is viewed under magniﬁcation. These fractals
are constructed through an iterative process of replacements of an object by
n copies of itself, each one of which is scaled by an r < 1 factor. Given a
self-similar structure, there is a relation between the scaling factor r and the
number n of pieces in which it is divided, according to the formula:

n =

1
rds

,

(1)

where ds is the called similarity dimension. Fractal dimensions provide a de-
scription of how much space the set ﬁlls.

The classic triadic Cantor fractal is an example of these structures. In its
build-up process a sequence of closed intervals is generated, one after the zero
step, two after the ﬁrst step, four after the second, eight after the third, and
so on. In general there will be 2k intervals of longitude 1
3k after the kth step.
Each iteration represents an order of growth. The Cantor fractal is deﬁned as
the array of points that remain after an inﬁnite process of removals. In Fig. 1
are shown grids constructed following the ﬁrst ﬁve orders of the triadic Cantor
fractal (n = 2 and r = 1/3). It has been drawn with a ﬁnite height to aid the
viewing.

A mathematical fractal is obtained by considering the structure that results
when the order of growth k → ∞. Practical fractals are self-similar over a
limited range of magniﬁcation and they are more appropriately referred as pre-
fractals. However, in this paper, the term fractal will be applied to structures
with ﬁnite k.

Fractals, as it was mentioned, can also be obtained using a statistical process.
The similarity dimension is not meaningful for this class of fractals. However,
there are other deﬁnitions of dimension that are deﬁned for any set. The Haus-
dorﬀ dimension, which is based on measures, is the oldest and probably the
most important. Box-counting or box dimension (also known as Kolmogorov
entropy, entropy dimension, capacity dimension and information dimension)
is another dimension very popular in physical applications.

In this work the focus is on strictly self-similar fractals. The Hausdorﬀ dimen-

2

sion equals the similarity dimension for self-similar fractals [2].

1.2 Moir´e eﬀect

In order to characterize fractal structures, optical diﬀraction and scattering
by fractal openings is being increasingly studied [3, 4, 5]. A complete list of
references can be found in Ref. [5]. It allows the properties and parameters
that characterize these objects to be determined.

More recently another powerful optical tool, the moir´e eﬀect, was applied to
this particular geometry [6, 7]. Moir´e patterns are observed when two similar
screens or sets of rulings are nearly superposed. They may be described as the
locus of points of intersection of the two overlapping grids, as it is shown in Fig.
2. Assume that each of the two original grids can be regarded as an indexed
family of lines. Then, the resulting moir´e patterns are most pronounced when
the indices of the intersections satisfy certain simple relations. This is known as
the indicial representation method for the determination of the moir´e patterns
[8], which could be called algebraic method.

[Insert ﬁgure 2 about here]

There are other methods to determine characteristics of moir´e patterns us-
ing diﬀerent approaches: geometric [9], analytic [10], vector [11], tensor [12],
autocorrelation [13], Fourier transformation [14], and by using a description
of the superposed grids according to Walsh functions [15]. These approaches
could be a sequence initiated as early as 1874 by Lord Rayleigh –who was the
ﬁrst to explain how moir´e patterns are observed from the superposition of two
families of equispaced parallel straight lines [16]–, and continues to date.

A Ronchi grid can be described as G (x, y, d, φ) by the expression:

G (x, y, d, φ) =

rect

N

n=1
X

[x − nd − φ(x, y)]
d/2

,







(2)




where x is the variable over which the rectangular function describes the
Ronchi grid distribution, y the variable that permits describing the grid G (x, y, d, φ)
in the plane (x, y), d the grid period and φ the phase of the grid considered as
its ﬁrst line position respect to the left border of the reference frame. Formally,
the bidimensional Ronchi grid can be represented as the Cartesian product
G = ExR, being E a straight line segment parallel to the y-axis of coordinates
and R the rectangular function in the x-axis of coordinates. Diﬀerent opera-
tors can be applied to the function G (x, y, d, φ), such as translation T (x, y)
over the plane (x, y), scaling S (x, y) that produces a variation of the original
period d, and rotation A (α) of the grid around its z axis in a certain angle α.

3

Finally, the superposition of the original grid G (x, y, d, φ) with the modi-
ﬁed grid G′ (x, y, d, φ), generated by the application of the operators T (x, y),
S (x, y), and A (α), or any of them, over G (x, y, d, φ), allows determining,
for example, the transmittance t (x, y) of the moir´e pattern by means of the
correlation G ∗ G′, according to:

t (x, y) =

G (x, y, d, φ)G′ (x, y, d, φ) dxdy.

When referring to the appearance of the moir´e phenomenon, the verbal form
“visual” is often used to describe the observation of the emerging geometrical
ﬁgures called moir´e patterns. It seems to be a little reductionistic approach
to describe it, because not only eyes observe moir´e patterns. In fact, any type
of image capture system can be successfully utilized to capture moir´e pat-
terns and to display them to be visually observed. Actually, moir´e patterns
can be photographed, photocopied, taken by TV camera, PC designed and
scanned, and, after some appropriate processes is applied to the captured in-
formation, they can be visually observed. Diﬀerent types of display support
are employed, as paper reproduced pictures, projected slides or transparencies,
photocopies, paper printed images, TV and monitor screen images, etc. How-
ever, it is convenient to mention that all detectors and displays listed above
are discrete in nature and ﬁnite in size. They have their proper structure.
Then, the bidimensional correlation function for detectors is limited by the
macroscopic dimensions of the devices (XM ) and the microscopic dimensions
of its sensible components (Xm) as shown in Fig. 3.

[Insert ﬁgure 3 about here]

Then the best matching between moir´e patterns and the structure of detectors
must be accomplished to assure the clearest observation of them and avoid
the appearance of the noisy aliasing eﬀect [17]. Also, the best observation of
moir´e fringes is strongly limited by the poor capacity of the eye to distinguish
very low and very high spatial frequency components in an image. Finally, the
observation of moir´e patterns is related with local and global correlations of
signals in the visual system [18].

Moir´e patterns are obtained from diﬀerent types of 2D grids: equispaced par-
allel lines—as in Fig. 2—, parallel lines of variable spacing, radial lines, circles
whose diﬀerence between consecutives radii is constant, zone plates, parabo-
las, spirals, etc. It has been shown that the moir´e eﬀect is also present after
superposing a Cantor bidimensional structure over its own replica rotated in
a small angle. It was also veriﬁed that self-similarity of the original fractal is
inherited by the moir´e pattern [6]. In order to illustrate this property, Fig. 4
shows the moir´e fringes obtained by superposing the triadic Cantor fractals

4

of orders k = 4, k = 5 and k = 6. In all the moir´e ﬁgures the fractal struc-
tures are superposed over their replicas, which have been rotated an angle of
10o. It is observed that the moir´e patterns contain tinier and more complex
structures as the order of growth increases. The central parts of the moir´e
patterns for orders of growth k = 5 and k = 6 were magniﬁed to observe the
structure in detail. The features in the magniﬁed region directly correspond to
the characteristic moir´e features of the precedent order. So the moir´e patterns
inherit the self-similarity of the original Cantor structures.

[Insert ﬁgure 4 about here]

Now, in this work it will be analysed if these Cantor moir´e structures are
fractals. To our knowledge this problem has not been introduced before.

The use of the term triadic Cantor fractal is, strictly, an abuse of language,
since in fact what is superposed is the structure which results of extending
the triadic Cantor perpendicularly within the 2D plane. However, it is a 1D
geometry because it only has full freedom in one dimension, while its other
dimension is completely determined. Then, it is possible to consider it as the
Cartesian product C = ExF :

C = ExF = {(x, y) : x ∈ E, y ∈ F } ,

(4)

where E is a straight line segment and F is the triadic Cantor set. It was
shown [19] that this structure has Hausdorﬀ dimension:

dimH C = dimH (ExF ) = dimH E + dimH F = 1 +

2 Analysis

The superposition of bidimensional structures to generate the moir´e eﬀect is
expressed by the logical operation of intersection ∩, which can be quantiﬁed by
means of the analytical operation of correlation of the mathematical functions
that describe the structures.

In order to visualize the intersection between the two Cantor moir´e structures
the following elementary algebra concept is applied:

A ∩ B = (Ac ∪ Bc)

c

.

(6)

The moir´e structure corresponds to the complement region obtained from the
union of the complement of the original structures. In Fig. 5 it is illustrated
this operation for the triadic Cantor fractal with order of growth k = 4.

5

[Insert ﬁgure 5 about here]

Now, it is easy to follow the behaviour of the moir´e when the order of growth
is increased. Figure 6 shows the intersection regions for the orders of growth
k = 3, k = 4 and k = 5.

[Insert ﬁgure 6 about here]

As the order of growth is increased the original rhombuses that result from the
intersection are divided in new four small rhombuses with length size scaled
by a factor r = 1/3. So, it is possible to conclude that the similarity dimension
of the moir´e structures is:

ds =

ln 4
ln 3

= 2

ln 2
ln 3

.

(7)

A justiﬁcation of this result can be achieved by analysing the intersection
formula for fractals. The following two theorems are used [20]:

Theorem A. If A, B are Borel subsets of Rn and σ ranges over a group G of
transformations, such as the group of translations, congruences or similarities
then:

dimH (A ∩ σ (B)) ≤ max {0, dimH (AxB) − n} ,

for almost all x ∈ Rn.

Theorem B. Let A, B ⊂ Rn be Borel sets, and let G be a group of transfor-
mations on Rn. Then:

dimH (A ∩ σ (B)) ≥ dimH A + dimH B − n,

for a set of motions σ ∈ G of positive measure in the following cases:

(a) G is the group of similarities and A and B are arbitrary sets;

(b) G is the group of rigid motions, A is arbitrary and B is a rectiﬁable curve,
surface, or manifold;

(c) G is the group of rigid motions and A and B are arbitrary, with either
dimH A > 1
2 (n + 1).

2 (n + 1) or dimH B > 1

Remember that a rigid motion or direct congruence may be achieved by a
combination of a rotation and a translation. It does not involve reﬂection.

The Cantor moir´e structures have A = B = C = ExF , n = 2 and σ a rotation.
Then:

dimH (C ∩ σ (C)) ≤ max {0, dimH (CxC) − 2} ,

dimH (C ∩ σ (C)) ≥ 2 dimH C − 2 = 2

But dimH (CxC) = 2 dimH C = 2 [1 + (ln 2/ln 3)] [21], so the following upper

dimH (C ∩ σ (C)) ≤ max {0, dimH (CxC) − 2} = max

(10)
Then, according to the results in equation (9) and (10) the Hausdorﬀ dimen-
sion of the Cantor moir´e structures straightforward equals to 2 ln 2/ln 3.

It is possible another explanation of this result by analysing the Cartesian
product F × F , where F is the triadic Cantor fractal. Figure 7 shows this
product. It was shown [22] that this Cartesian Cantor product has a Hausdorﬀ
dimension exactly 2 ln 2/ln 3.

[Insert ﬁgure 7 about here]

The Cantor moir´e structure is obtained under a bi-Lipschitz transformation
f of this Cartesian product, i.e.:

f : X → Y,

c1 |x − y| ≤ |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ c2 |x − y| ,

(x, y ∈ X) ,

(11)

for 0 < c1 ≤ c2 < ∞. Furthermore, the Hausdorﬀ dimension is invariant un-
der bi-Lipschitz transformation [23]. Then, it is conﬁrmed that the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of the new structure is 2 ln 2/ln 3.

It is easy to extend these results to other Cantor sets. Figure 8 shows the
septic Cantor bars (n = 4 and r = 1/7, being d = ln 4/ln 7) in their ﬁrst four
orders of growth.

[Insert ﬁgure 8 about here]

The intersection regions associated to this fractal for the orders of growth
k = 1, k = 2 and k = 3 are shown in Fig. 9. The original rhombuses are
divided in new sixteen small rhombuses with length size scaled by a factor
r = 1/7. Then,

ds =

3 Conclusions

It can be concluded that the Cantor moir´e structures are self-similar frac-
tals with twice the similarity and Hausdorﬀ dimension of the original Cantor
structures.

The extension of these results to other fractal constructions is of great im-
portance because new fractal structures can be obtained. The intention is to
demonstrate that one way of constructing ‘new fractals from old’ is by forming
moir´e with them ∗ .

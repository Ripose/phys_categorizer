We present quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations (QMBE) for spatially inhomogeneous semiconduc-
tor laser devices which are derived from the operator dynamics of the quantized light ﬁeld coupled
to the charge carrier system. The QMBE include, in particular, the spatiotemporal quantum ﬂuctu-
ation eﬀects responsible for spontaneous emission and ampliﬁed spontaneous emission. The spatial
coherence and intensity distribution of the light ﬁeld is given by the ﬁeld-ﬁeld correlation function.
The light-matter interaction is mediated by the ﬁeld-dipole correlation. This correlation originates
from both the polarization of the medium induced by the electromagnetic ﬁeld and from the dipole
ﬂuctuations in the semiconductor medium. The dipole ﬂuctuations are expressed in terms of a prod-
uct of the electron and hole densities. The spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes is thus
caused by the dipole ﬂuctuations which arise whenever electrons and holes meet. The resulting light
ﬁeld intensity propagates coherently in an optical cavity, subject to further ampliﬁcation and/or
absorption in the semiconductor medium. The equations presented describe the way the spatial
In
coherence of the light ﬁeld emerges in the presence of speciﬁc geometries of the laser cavity.
particular, equations for both edge emitting and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs)
are formulated. The equations for VCSELs include the light ﬁeld polarization, allowing a detailed
description of spatial polarization patterns and the emergence of polarization stability at threshold.
Analytical expressions are given for the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission. For the case of a
broad area edge emitting laser, we derive from the QMBE the spontaneous emission factor and the
spatial optical pattern of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission.

I. INTRODUCTION

The spatiotemporal dynamics of semiconductor lasers can be simulated successfully by semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch
equations without including any quantum eﬀects in the light ﬁeld (for an overview of the theory and modeling see [1]
and references therein). The classical treatment of the light ﬁeld is justiﬁed by the high intensity of the laser light
well above threshold. However, the incoherent noise required by the uncertainty principle in both the electrical dipole
of the semiconductor medium and the light ﬁeld itself is of signiﬁcant importance when several cavity modes compete
or when the laser is close to threshold.

Photon rate equations for multi-mode operation of semiconductor lasers show that the spontaneous emission terms
may contribute signiﬁcantly to the spectral characteristics of the light ﬁeld emitted by the laser [2,3]. Such models
assume a ﬁxed mode structure determined entirely by the empty cavity. This assumption does not apply to gain
guided lasers and to unstable resonators, however [4–6]. In these cases it is therefore desirable to explicitly describe
the spatial coherence of spontaneous emission.

The spatial coherence of spontaneous emission and ampliﬁed spontaneous emission is even more important in devices
close to threshold or devices with a light ﬁeld output dominated by spontaneous emission such as superluminescent
diodes and ultra low threshold semiconductor lasers [7,8]. Ultra-low threshold lasers may actually operate in a regime
of negative gain where spontaneous emission is the only source of radiation [7]. A description of the light ﬁeld emitted
by such devices therefore requires an explicit description of the spatial coherence in spontaneous emission as well.

In order to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of multi mode operation, of lasers near threshold, low threshold
lasers or superluminescent diodes, it is therefore necessary to include the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission caused by
the presence of quantum noise in the Maxwell-Bloch equations for such devices. A starting point for a description
of quantum noise eﬀects is the dynamics of quantum mechanical operators of the ﬁeld and carrier system. Since the
operator dynamics of the carrier system have been investigated in the context of Maxwell-Bloch equations before [9]
and the light ﬁeld equations correspond exactly to the classical Maxwell’s equations, it is possible to focus only on
the local light-matter interaction. Once the properties of this interaction are formulated in terms of the expectation
values of ﬁeld-ﬁeld correlations, dipole-ﬁeld correlations, carrier densities, ﬁelds and dipoles, the dynamics of the
carrier system and the light ﬁeld propagation may be added.

In section II, the quantum dynamics of the interaction between the light ﬁeld and the carrier system is formulated
in terms of Wigner distributions for the carriers and of spatially continuous amplitudes for the light ﬁeld. The
equations are formulated for both bulk material and for quantum wells including the eﬀects of anisotropic coupling
to the polarization components of the light ﬁeld. Section III summarizes the eﬀects of the dynamics of the electron-
hole system in the semiconductor material. The light ﬁeld dynamics are introduced in section IV. By quantizing
Maxwell’s equation, the coupling constant g0 introduced in section II is expressed in terms of the interband dipole
matrix element. The complete set of quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations is presented in section V. Based on this
general formulation, speciﬁc approximate versions for quantum well edge emitting and vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers are derived. The aspect of temporal coherence and spectra is discussed in section VI. In section VII, analytical
results for the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission in quantum wells as well as the spontaneous emission factor
β and the far ﬁeld pattern of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission in broad area quantum well lasers are presented. Section
VIII concludes the article.

II. DYNAMICS OF THE LIGHT-CARRIER INTERACTION

A. Hamiltonian dynamics of densities and ﬁelds

In following, we will describe the active semiconductor medium in terms of an isotropic two-band model where, for
the case of the holes, a suitably averaged eﬀective mass is taken [9]. A generalization to more bands is straightforward.
In terms of the local annihilation operators for photons (ˆbR), electrons (ˆcR), and holes ( ˆdR), the Hamiltonian of the
light-carrier interaction can be written as

(cid:17)
The operator dynamics associated with this Hamiltonian are then given by

The discrete positions R correspond to the lattice sites of the Bravais lattice describing the semiconductor crystal.
Each lattice site actually represents the spatial volume ν0 of the Wigner-Seitz cell of the lattice. For zincblende crystal
structure, this volume is equal to one quarter of the cubed lattice constant. In the case of AlGaAs structures the lattice
10−29m3 [10]. The photon annihilation operator ˆbR therefore describes
constant is about 5.65
the annihilation of a photon within a volume ν0. Here, we will focus on the light-carrier interaction and the quantum
noise contributions responsible for spontaneous emission. For that purpose, we extend the semiclassical description

Note that this set of equations already represents a closed description of the ﬁeld dynamics. If, as in many experimental
conﬁgurations, the absolute phase of the light ﬁeld and dipole operators may be considered unknown, these equations
are suﬃcient for a description of the light-carrier interaction. However, when two time correlations are of interest or
in the case of coherent excitation by injection of an external laser it may also be necessary to additionally consider
the dynamics of the ﬁeld and dipole expectation values, i.e.,

B. Physical background of the factorization

In the following, we will brieﬂy discuss the implications of the factorization performed in the derivation of (3a).
In order to formulate the dynamics of the light-matter interaction without including higher order correlations, three
terms have been factorized in the time derivative of the ﬁeld-dipole correlation (3b). The factorizations are

No additional factorizations are necessary in the density dynamics of photons, electrons and holes. The three fac-
torizations are based on the assumption of statistical independence between the densities of photons, electrons and
holes. Since we are not considering ﬂuctuations in the particle densities, this is a necessary assumption.

Equations (4a) and (4b) separate the photon density from the carrier densities. These terms represent stimulated
emission processes. Therefore, a correlation of the photon density with the carrier densities would lead to a modiﬁed
stimulated emission rate. Below threshold, this eﬀect will be small because the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission is
distributed over many modes such that the local correlations between photon and carrier densities are weak. Above
threshold, the photon number ﬂuctuations in the lasing mode cause relaxation oscillations. The photon number
ﬂuctuations are nearly ninety degrees out of phase with the carrier number ﬂuctuations. Therefore, the time averaged
correlation is still negligible.

Equation (4c) separates the electron and hole densities. This term represents the spontaneous emission caused by
the simultaneous presence of electrons and holes in the same location. Although it is reasonable to assume that the
high rate of scattering at high carrier densities eﬀectively reduce all electron-hole correlations to zero, it is important
implies a phase correlation between the electrons and the holes. In fact,
to note that the interband dipole
the spontaneous emission term factorized according to equation (4c) originates from the dipole-dipole correlation
ˆc†
.
R
i
h
The dynamics of the ﬁeld-ﬁeld and the ﬁeld-dipole correlations are then identical to the dynamics of the products of the
ﬁelds and dipoles. Therefore, that factorization corresponds to the approximations of the conventional Maxwell-Bloch
equations such as described in [9] which do not rigorously include spontaneous emission.

. Note that this term could also be factorized into the product of dipole operators

Generally, spontaneous emission must always arise from random phase ﬂuctuations. These are given by the product
of electron and hole densities. While the phase dependent dipole relaxes quickly due to scattering events, the carrier
densities are preserved during scattering. Therefore

is usually a good assumption in semiconductor systems. Note that this assumption does fail in the case of low carrier
densities and high dipole inducing ﬁelds. However, this case only occurs if the light ﬁeld is injected from an external
source. In semiconductor lasers and in light emitting diodes, the major contribution to the dipole-dipole correlations
stems from the product of electron and hole densities. To check the statistical independence of photon, electron, and
hole densities, it is also convenient to check the corresponding inequality for the three particle coherence represented
by the ﬁeld-dipole correlation,

Thus, if a calculation does not fulﬁll this requirement, particle density correlations additionally have to be taken into
account.

C. Wigner function formulation

In order to connect the light-carrier interaction to the highly dissipative carrier transport equations, it is practical to
transform the carrier and dipole densities using Wigner transformations [11]. Replacing the discrete density matrices
by continuous ones obtained by polynomial interpolation will allow e.g. for numerical purposes an arbitrary choice
of the discretization scales, which generally will be much larger than a lattice constant. Analytically, it permits an
application of diﬀerential operators. Physically, the particle densities are smooth functions over distances of several
lattice constants. A coherence length shorter than e.g. ten lattice constants would require k states with
of at least
one twentieth of the Brilloin zone diameter. In typical laser devices, however, the electrons and holes all accumulate
near the fundamental gap at k = 0. Therefore, it is simply a matter of convenience to deﬁne the continuous densities
such that

These continuous functions may then be transformed into Wigner functions by

The normalization of these Wigner functions has been chosen in such a way that a value of one represents the
maximal phase space density possible for Fermions, that is one particle per state. Since the density of states in the
six-dimensional phase space given by r and k is 1/8π3, a factor of 1/8π3 will appear whenever actual carrier densities
need to be obtained from the Wigner functions. However, the normalization in terms of the maximal possible phase
space density is convenient because it represents the probability that a quantum state in a given region of phase space
is occupied. Therefore, the Wigner distribution corresponding to the thermal equilibrium of a given particle density
is directly given by the Fermi function.

To deal with the light ﬁeld dynamics in the same manner, the ﬁeld and ﬁeld-ﬁeld correlation variables must also be

deﬁned on a continuous length scale. In order to obtain photon densities, we deﬁne

Finally, the dipole-ﬁeld correlation must be deﬁned accordingly, such that

D. Local approximation

The integrals over x and q represent seemingly non-local eﬀects introduced by the transformation into Wigner
functions. This property of the Wigner transformation retains the coherent eﬀects in the carrier system. For the
interaction of the carriers with the light ﬁeld, it ensures momentum conservation by introducing a non-local phase
correlation in the dipole ﬁeld corresponding to the total momentum of the electron and hole concentrations involved.
Eﬀectively, the integral over q converts the momentum part of the Wigner distributions into a coherence length. This
coherence length then reappears in the spatial structure of the dipole ﬁeld and the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by
the carrier distribution. However, the coherence length in the carrier system is usually much shorter than the optical
wavelength. It can therefore be approximated by a spatial delta function. Here, we do this by noting that

If the eﬀects of the momentum shift q in the Wigner functions is neglected, the integrals may then be solved, yielding
only local interactions between the carrier system and the light ﬁeld:

E. Light-carrier interaction for quantum wells

Similar equations may also be formulated for a quantum well structure by replacing the phase space density of 1/8π3
with 1/4π2, reducing the spatial coordinates of the carrier system to two dimensions, and introducing a delta function
for the coordinate perpendicular to the quantum well at the points where ﬁeld coordinates correspond to dipole
coordinates. Of course, the electromagnetic ﬁeld remains three dimensional, even though the dipole it originates from
is conﬁned to two dimensions. In particular, the correlation C(r; r′, k) has both a three dimensional coordinate r and
a two dimensional coordinate r′. It is therefore useful to distinguish the two dimensional and the three dimensional
. Note that in
coordinates. In the following, the two dimensional carrier coordinates will be marked with the index
some cases, both r and rk appear in the equations. In those cases, the in-plane coordinates rx and ry are equal, while
the perpendicular coordinate rz must be equal to the quantum well coordinate z0. The equations for the interaction
of the three dimensional light ﬁeld with the two dimensional electron-hole system in a single quantum well subband
then read

Note that the value of g0 will usually be slightly lower than the bulk value because the overlap of the spatial wave-
functions of the electrons and the holes in the lowest subbands is less than one. The equations derived above represent
the interaction of a single conduction band and a single valence band with a single scalar light ﬁeld. Neither the spin
degeneracy of the carriers nor the polarization of the light ﬁeld has been considered.

F. Spin degeneracy and light ﬁeld polarization

Since the geometry of light ﬁeld emission is highly dependent on polarization eﬀects such eﬀects should also be
taken into account in the framework of this theory. The basic interaction between a single conduction band, a single
valence band and a single light ﬁeld polarization are accurately represented by equations (13a-13f) and (14a-14f). By
adding the contributions of separate transitions, any many band system may be described based on these equations.
In semiconductor quantum wells the situation is considerably simpliﬁed if only the lowest subbands are considered.
Then there are only two completely separate transitions involving circular light ﬁeld polarizations coupled to a single
one of the two electron and hole bands. The quantum well structure does not interact with light ﬁelds which are
linearly polarized in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the quantum well. The equations for quantum wells
are therefore completed by adding an index of + or

to each variable.

−

6

The situation in the bulk system is much more involved. The transitions occur between the two fold degenerate
spin 1/2 system of the electrons and the four fold degenerate spin 3/2 system of the holes. All three polarization
directions of the light ﬁeld are equally possible, connecting each of the electron bands with three of the four hole
bands. However, since the eﬀective mass of the two heavy hole bands is much larger than the eﬀective mass of the
light holes (e.g. by a factor of eight in GaAs), only a small fraction of the holes will be in the light-hole bands (about
6% in GaAs for equilibrium distributions). Consequently, the carrier subsystem can again be separated into two
pairs of bands. However, the light ﬁeld polarization emitted by the electron-heavy hole transitions in bulk material is
circularly polarized with respect to the relative momentum 2k of the electron and the heavy hole. Since usually there
is no strong directional anisotropy in the k space distribution of the carriers, it can be assumed that one third of the
k space volume contributes to each polarization direction and the equations may be formulated accordingly.

In the following, we will assume that the Wigner distributions of the two pairs of bands considered are approximately
equal at all times. Note that this means that hole burning eﬀects in the spin and polarization dynamics which may
occur in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers [12] are ignored. However, such eﬀects have been investigated in several
other studies [13–16] and are found to be fairly weak in some devices [17].

The complete set of dynamical equations can now be formulated by adding the carrier dynamics and the linear part

of Maxwell’s equations to the light-carrier interaction.

III. CARRIER DYNAMICS

Modeling the carrier dynamics of a semiconductor system can be a formidable task all by itself. A number of
approximations and models have been developed to deal with the eﬀects of many-particle interactions and correlations
and with the dissipation caused by the electron-phonon interactions. In the following, we choose a simple diﬀusion
model. Many particle renormalizations are not mentioned explicitly, but can be added in a straightforward manner.
We assume that the electron and hole densities will be kept equal by the Coulomb interaction, which will induce a

current whenever charges are separated. Therefore, it is possible to deﬁne the ambipolar carrier density N (r) with

N (r) =

d3kf e(r, k)

=

d3kf h(r, k).

Note that the two fold degeneracy of the electron and heavy hole bands has been included by choosing a density of

states of
8π3 . This includes the assumption that the Wigner distribution does not depend on the spin
variable of the electrons and holes as mentioned above.
The light carrier interaction of this carrier density is

where the index i denotes the component of the light ﬁeld or dipole density corresponding to the linear polarization
direction of i = x, y, z. In the case of Cij (r; r′, k) the index i refers to the ﬁeld polarization and the second index
j denotes the vector component of the dipole vector. Equation (16) shows how the ﬁeld-dipole correlation converts
electron-hole pairs into photons. The total carrier density dynamics can now be formulated as

The k dependence of the distribution functions f e(r, k) and f h(r, k) may be approximated by assuming that the
electrons and holes will always be in thermal equilibrium. The distribution functions are then given by Fermi functions

function of the carrier density N (r). A useful estimate of this relationship is given by the Pade approximation [9,18].
Spectral holeburning may be taken into account by introducing a relaxation time τr and converting the dynamics
of the distribution function due to the light-carrier interaction into a deviation from the equilibrium distribution by
adiabatic elimination of the relaxation dynamics:

Finally, the carrier dynamics of the dipole p(r, k) and the dipole part of the ﬁeld-dipole correlation C(r; r′, k) needs
to be formulated. Since both depend on a correlation of the electrons with the holes, they will necessarily relax
rather quickly at a rate of Γ(k) which should be of the same order of magnitude as 1/τr. Physically, Γ(k) may be
interpreted as the total momentum dependent scattering rate in the carrier system. The remainder of the dynamics
can be derived from the single particle dynamics. This unitary contribution to the evolution of the dipole may be
expressed by a momentum dependent frequency Ω(k). For parabolic bands and isotropic eﬀective masses me/h

frequency is given by

Many-particle eﬀects due to the Coulomb interaction between the carriers may be included by introducing a carrier
density dependence in Γ(k, N (r)) and Ω(k, N (r)). Such renormalization terms representing the mean ﬁeld eﬀects
of the carrier-carrier interaction have been derived and discussed e.g.
in [9]. In the following, this many particle
renormalization will not be mentioned explicitly, although it can be included in a straightforward manner.

of p(r, k) would include an additional phase factor of exp[

is to establish resonance with the corresponding frequency range in the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the dynamics of which
we consider next.

IV. MAXWELL’S EQUATION

an arbitrary phase factor depending only on the deﬁnition of the states used for its determination. For convenience,
we assume a deﬁnition of phases such that dcv is real. The dipole density P0(r) may then be written as

Cij (r; r′, k) as well, it is now possible to formulate a complete set of quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations.

In order to describe a realistic diode one needs to describe not only the volume of the active region but also the
propagation of light out of this region. This may either be achieved by deﬁning realistic boundary conditions or by
setting all material properties equal to zero outside a ﬁnite active volume and calculating the light ﬁeld propagation
into the outside medium by varying ǫr in space.

B. Three dimensional quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations for quantum wells

Next, we will formulate the equations for a quantum well structure. For this case, we will also describe diﬀerent
cavity structures and the appropriate paraxial approximations possible for the various types of laser devices. Using

Note that N (rk) is the total carrier density. Therefore, the density per quantum well which determines the chemical
potential of the carrier distribution functions is N (rk)/Q. Again, the structure of an external cavity may be considered
either by boundary conditions or by spatially varying ǫr. In particular laser diodes may be described by distinguishing
between reﬂective and non-reﬂective edges. If the reﬂective surface is perpendicular to the plane of the quantum wells,
the laser is an edge emitter. If the reﬂectivity is very high on the surface planes parallel to the quantum wells, the
laser is a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL).

C. One dimensional quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations for edge emitting lasers

In an edge emitting laser, the laser light ﬁeld propagates in the plane of the quantum well. Since the z-direction
is already deﬁned as the one perpendicular to the quantum well we will deﬁne the y-direction as the direction along
which the laser light propagates. A schematic representation of this type of laser geometry is shown in ﬁgure 1. It is
possible to drastically reduce the dimensionality of the equation describing the edge emitting laser geometry by noting
that the light ﬁeld polarization of the ampliﬁed ﬁelds will be in the plane of the quantum well and by limiting the
(r) with the following properties:
analysis to a single longitudinal mode. Eﬀectively, this corresponds to a light ﬁeld

E

The envelope function ξ(ry, rz) describes both the propagation along the y-direction and the conﬁnement along the
z-direction. It represents an approximate solution of the wave equation in the yz-plane normalized by

Ex(r) :=
Ez(r) := 0
∂
∂ry Ey(r) :=

−

E0(rx)ξ(ry, rz)

∂

The equations are then limited to light ﬁeld modes with the two dimensional envelope ξ(ry, rz). Spontaneous emission
into other light ﬁeld modes must be considered by including the rate of emission in the carrier recombination rate

considering the openness of the optical cavity. With the reﬂectivities of the laser mirrors given by R1 and R2, the
light ﬁeld in the cavity is damped by losses through the mirrors at a rate of

D. Two dimensional quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations for VCSELs

In a VCSEL the light ﬁeld is strongly conﬁned by highly reﬂective mirrors above and below the quantum wells. The
light ﬁeld propagates perpendicular to the quantum well structure as shown in ﬁgure 2. Therefore both the possible
polarization directions and the spatial dynamics remain two dimensional. Only the z-direction may be eliminated by
averaging over a single longitudinal mode. Coupling terms between the polarization directions should be taken into
account, even if they are small. For VCSELs, the assumptions read

Equations (40a) present a starting point for the study of spatial polarization patterns and ﬂuctuations in VCSELs. For
more realistic models, it may also be desirable to include a spatial dependence of the birefringence and the dichroism.
Also, nonlinear eﬀects may be introduced, e.g. by separating the carrier densities for right and left circular polarization
[12].

VI. FLUCTUATIONS AND TWO TIME CORRELATIONS

A. Interpretation of the correlation terms

Using the equations presented above, it is now possible to calculate the emergence of a spatially coherent light
ﬁeld in semiconductor diodes even below the laser threshold. If all variables are initially zero and only the current
j(r) serves as a source of energy, the spontaneous emission dynamics builds up a light ﬁeld with random phase.
Consequently, the ﬁeld variables E(r) and p(r, k) remain zero even far above laser threshold. If there is an initial ﬁeld
E(r) at t = 0, it will disappear exponentially at a rate roughly corresponding to the Schawlow-Townes linewidth. This
eﬀect is a consequence of the incoherent contribution to the light ﬁeld emission included in the temporal evolution
of the ﬁeld-dipole correlation C(r; r′, k). The ﬂow of energy through the laser diode is adequately represented by
the correlations and densities. The dynamics of N (r), C(r; r′, k) and I(r; r′) form a closed set of equations which is
independent from the temporal evolution of E(r) and p(r, k). This is a natural consequence of the fact that absolute
phases cannot have physical eﬀects. The relative phases are all considered in the correlations and densities. This does
not include relative phases at diﬀerent times, however. Since the correlations given by C(r; r′, k) and I(r; r′) refer to

14

a single time, they do not provide suﬃcient information on the evaluation of two time correlations and spectra. In
order to obtain the two time correlation functions, the dynamics of such correlations have to be formulated separately.
The temporal evolution of a two time correlation between times t and t + τ as a function of τ is equivalent to the
ﬁeld dynamics, with the initial condition for τ = 0 being given by the correlations C(r; r′, k) and I(r; r′).
If the
ﬂuctuations in the carrier densities are neglected, it is therefore possible to obtain the two time correlation functions
by solving the linear dynamics of E(r) and p(r, k) for constant carrier densities and the initial conditions deﬁned by
C(r; r′, k) and I(r; r′). In the case of a VCSEL, these equations are

Since the equations are linear, the frequencies and linewidths may be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for
the linear operator deﬁning the dynamics.

In many cases, however, neglecting the carrier density ﬂuctuations may not be a realistic assumption. For instance,
the linewidths determined from equations (42a) and (42b) are likely to be too low. Since there is a correlation
between the carrier densities and the frequencies ampliﬁed by the dipole dynamics, an omission of the carrier density
ﬂuctuations corresponds to an omission of the associated frequency ﬂuctuations. This frequency ﬂuctuation causes an
enhancement of the linewidth which is usually described by the linewidth enhancement factor α in phenomenological
models. Even though the carrier density dependent frequency shift described by α is properly represented by the dipole
dynamics of the quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations, the linewidth enhancement itself is not included in equations (42a)
and (42b) as a consequence of neglecting the carrier density ﬂuctuations. Also, equations (42a) and (42b) do not
describe the eﬀects of relaxation oscillations caused by carrier density ﬂuctuations.
In particular, the oscillatory
ﬂuctuations in the spatial carrier distribution may cause major modiﬁcations in the spectra of non-lasing modes
[19]. To investigate such aspects of the carrier density ﬂuctuations, the quantum noise terms may be represented as
stochastic noise terms in a Langevin equation.

B. Langevin equations

The quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations describe the light ﬁeld emission in terms of the average Intensities and
ﬁeld-dipole correlations. Since the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations prevent us from knowing the actual ﬁeld
and dipole variables, this is the best we can do. However, it is also possible to formulate classical Langevin equations
which produce the same statistics as the quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations [20,21]. In these equations, the vacuum
ﬂuctuations of the light ﬁeld which are not included in the intensity I(r; r) must be taken into account. In the light
ﬁeld vacuum, these ﬂuctuations are

from quantum mechanics. The dipole ﬂuctuations associated with a given carrier density must also be considered. In

The dipole noise function shows that the dipole ﬂuctuates if there is either an electron and a hole or neither an
electron nor a hole in the same state. If there is only either a hole or an electron in a given state, the dipole does not
ﬂuctuate.

The noise sources in

(r) and p(r, k) must now be determined in such a way that the vacuum noise lost due to
the damping terms are compensated by the noise input. Therefore, the damping rates κ and Γ(k) determine the
magnitude of the noise input. For a VCSEL, the corresponding Langevin equation reads

The Langevin equations for a bulk active medium and for an edge emitter may be formulated in the same manner.
These Langevin equations allow a stochastical simulation of quantum noise in a semiclassical context. The major
drawback of this method is that weak ﬁelds will be hard to distinguish from the quantum noise of the photon vacuum.
In the quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations, the quantum noise intensity is already subtracted from the intensity I(r; r),
so that even intensities of far less than one photon in a given mode may be calculated. In laser systems far above
threshold, however, it may be easier and even more realistic to obtain the two time correlations describing the
ﬂuctuations of the light ﬁeld by using the Langevin equations.

VII. AMPLIFIED SPONTANEOUS EMISSION PROPERTIES: ANALYTICAL RESULTS OF THE

A. Gain and spontaneous emission

The gain per unit length can be obtained by dividing the rate G(ω) by the speed of light in the semiconductor

of spontaneous emission, it is more convenient to use the ampliﬁcation rate as a starting point.

With increasing carrier density N , transparency is reached at N = 1012cm−2 (g1). This density is characterized by
vanishing gain (i.e. there is neither gain nor absorption) at a frequency of ¯hω = 0. At the same time, however, there
is a signiﬁcant contribution of spontaneous emission (s1) with a maximum at a frequency of ¯hω

B. Spontaneous emission factor and far ﬁeld pattern of an edge emitting laser

In the optical cavity of a laser the equations for gain and spontaneous emission are modiﬁed by the mode structure.
In particular, the total linear response of an electromagnetic ﬁeld mode inside the cavity includes the cavity loss rate
κ. For the edge emitting semiconductor laser, the gain function of the cavity modes is given by

where the conﬁnement factor σ is deﬁned according to equation (37). Spontaneous emission into the cavity modes
passes through the gain medium and is thereby absorbed or ampliﬁed accordingly. Thus for an edge emitting laser,
the rate of spontaneous emission into a cavity mode of frequency ω is given by

This rate represents the total rate of spontaneous emission events per mode, regardless of the actual width of the
laser. On the other hand, equation (53) gives the total rate of spontaneous emission per quantum well area.

In a laser of length L and total width W (c.f. Fig. 1), the spontaneous emission rate into free space is LW Stotal.
The spontaneous emission factor β, which is generally deﬁned as the fraction of spontaneous emission being emitted
into the cavity mode [2], is on the basis of our theory given by the expression

1. Spontaneous emission factor

β(ω, N1D) =

τsS1D
W N1D

.

Note that the two dimensional carrier density N in the quantum well is related to the one dimensional carrier
density N1D by N1D = L N . The spontaneous emission factor β is a function of both frequency and carrier density.
Consequently, the common assumption of the spontaneous emission factor β being independent of the carrier density
[2,7] may be regarded as an approximation similar to the assumption of linear gain.

An analytical expression for the spontaneous emission factor may be obtained for zero temperature. The k-space
integrals may then be solved analytically using equation (20) and assuming that Γ is independent of kk. For the
spontaneous emission factor β, the analytical result reads

The Fermi frequency Ωf is deﬁned by equation(57) and expresses, in particular, the carrier density dependence of β.
For Ωf , ω
Γ + κ we recover the result typically given in the literature (e.g. [2]) which does not depend on N . Fig. 4
shows the deviation of the spontaneous emission factor from this value as the Fermi frequency Ωf passes the point of
resonance with the cavity mode. Fig. 4 illustrates, in particular, the carrier density dependence of β for three modes
with frequencies above the band gap frequency given by (a) ω = 0, (b) ω = 0.5(Γ + κ), and (c) ω = Γ + κ. Most
notably, β is always smaller than the usual estimate given by β(ω = Ωf = 0), which is based on the assumption of
ideal resonance between the transition frequency and the cavity mode.

Note that this result may also be obtained directly from equations (36a-36e). In a wide cavity, the cavity modes are
approximately plane wave modes and the relation between I0(ω) and I0(rx; r′

x) in that case reads

The steady state intensity distribution is characterized by the spatial coherence derived from the intensity distribution
of the plane wave modes of the cavity. Generally, the intensity distribution of plane waves corresponds in the far ﬁeld
to an optical ﬁeld at angles relative to the axis of emission in the plane of the quantum well. The angular distribution
of intensity and coherence in the far ﬁeld is thus given by

Therefore, the far ﬁeld intensity distribution may be determined directly from the frequency dependence of the
intensities by

The parameter R represents the ratio between the cavity loss rate κ and the maximum ampliﬁcation rate of the gain
medium. Laser activity is only possible if R < 1. The classical laser threshold is deﬁned by the carrier density for
which the denominator of If (Θ, Θ) is zero for a single speciﬁc frequency ω(Θ). Consequently, the carrier density at
which this occurs is pinned. Figure 5 shows the far ﬁeld intensity distribution for diﬀerent carrier densities below this
pinning density. In Fig. 5 (a), the wide intensity distribution of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission for carrier densities
is much lower than the pinning density. The intensity maximum is clearly located at Θ = 0. Figure 5(a) shows the
intensity distribution for carrier densities halfway towards threshold. Already, the intensity maxima move to angles
15◦, corresponding to the frequency at which the gain spectrum has its maximum. In the case of Fig. 5(c), the
of
threshold region is very close to the pinning density. The peaks in the far ﬁeld pattern narrow as the laser intensity
is increased. Consequently the far ﬁeld pattern indeed is a measure of the spatial coherence – similar as the linewidth
of the laser spectrum is a measure of temporal coherence. It is therefore desirable to consider quantum noise eﬀects
in the spatial patterns of optical systems. In the context of squeezing, such patterns have been investigated by Gatti
and coworkers [22] based on the general formulation of Lugiato and Castelli [23]. The laser patterns presented here
are based on the same principles. Usually, however, the strong dissipation prevents squeezing in laser systems unless
the pump-noise ﬂuctuations are suppressed [24].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations (QMBE) for spatially inhomogeneous semiconductor lasers derived in this
paper take into account the quantum mechanical nature of the light ﬁeld as well as that of the carrier system. The
only approximation used in the derivation of the intensity and correlation dynamics is that of statistical indepen-
dence between the two carrier systems and the light ﬁeld.
In the QMBE presented here, the eﬀects of coherent
spatiotemporal quantum ﬂuctuations which are generally not considered in the semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations
for semiconductor laser devices have thus been taken into account.

The spontaneous emission term appears side by side with the gain and absorption term in the dynamics of the ﬁeld-
dipole correlation. In this way the spatial coherence of spontaneous emission and ampliﬁed spontaneous emission is
consistently described by the quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations. Typical features of the model have been illustrated
by the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission. An example of the spatial coherence characteristics described
by the quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations has been presented by analytically obtaining the spontaneous emission
factor β and the far ﬁeld distribution for the example of a broad area edge emitting laser. In general the quantum
Maxwell-Bloch equations derived for edge emitting and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers provide a starting point
for a detailed analysis of spatial coherence patterns in diverse semiconductor laser geometries such as broad area or
ultra-low threshold lasers.

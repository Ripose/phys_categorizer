X-ray diﬀraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of x-ray imaging that is being practiced at
several third-generation synchrotron-radiation x-ray facilities. Although only ﬁve years have elapsed
since the technique was ﬁrst introduced, it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resolution
three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nm resolution with much larger samples than can be
imaged in the transmission electron microscope. Both life- and materials-science applications of
XDM are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resolution will be radiation
damage for life science and the coherent power of available x-ray sources for material science. In this
paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage. We use a statistical analysis based
on the so-called “dose fractionation theorem” of Hegerl and Hoppe to calculate the dose needed
to make an image of a life-science sample by XDM with a given resolution. We conclude that the
needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resolution and present experimental evidence
to support this ﬁnding. To determine the maximum tolerable dose we have assembled a number of
data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resolution
that are not well covered by reports in the literature. The tentative conclusion of this study is
that XDM should be able to image frozen-hydrated protein samples at a resolution of about 10 nm
with“Rose-criterion” image quality.

INTRODUCTION

X-ray diﬀraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of
x-ray imaging that is now being practiced by the authors
at the Advanced Light Source x-ray facility at Berkeley
[1, 2]. Similar work has been done at the synchrotron-
light sources at Brookhaven [3, 4], Argonne [5, 6] and the
Spring 8 facility in Japan [7, 8]. The method works in
both 2D and 3D and can be adapted for both life [4] and
materials sciences. The images are generated in three
steps; (1) diﬀraction patterns are recorded using coher-
ent x-rays (just one for 2D or a tilt series for 3D) which
provides the amplitudes of the diﬀracted wave ﬁeld, (2)
the phases of the wave ﬁeld are obtained using variants of
phase-retrieval algorithms developed in other branches of
optics [9, 10, 11] and (3) the image is recovered by means
of a Fourier transform.

This form of x-ray imaging was ﬁrst suggested by Sayre
[12] and ﬁrst demonstrated at Brookhaven in 1999 by
Miao, Charalambous, Kirz and Sayre [3]. The latter ex-
periment achieved a resolution of 75 nm using 0.73 keV
x-rays and subsequent 2D experiments have pushed that
value down to 7 nm measured in the image [7]. Our own
XDM experiments have been done in the energy region
0.5–0.8 keV while other workers have used energies up to
8 keV. Although all of the above-mentioned groups have
achieved 3D imaging with test objects, the resolution in
these experiments is still several times worse than in 2D.

Nevertheless the expansion of interest in the technique
and the progress in developing its performance has been
rapid and we are lead to investigate the fundamental lim-
its to this form of microscopy. It appears that the limit
for life-science samples will be set by radiation damage,
while for more-radiation-hard materials-science samples
it will be set by the coherent power of available x-ray
sources.

In this paper we address the question of the role of
damage in setting a resolution limit to life-science imag-
ing by XDM. This is important because, XDM is expen-
sive (it needs at least an undulator on a third-generation
synchrotron source) and if it is to have a niche in which it
delivers unique and useful results, then it must produce
performance beyond the limits of other microscopes. In
this work, we refer to the practice of fast freezing the
sample and holding it at low temperature for imaging, as
“cryo-protection”. Such protection is used, for example,
by the Munich group in their “electron-cryotomography”
system [13] which recently demonstrated a 3D resolution
of 5-6 nm for biological samples of thickness 0.3-0.6 µm.
Further analysis by the same group [14] has indicated
that, although the resolution may eventually be improved
by a factor of 2-3, the thickness is a hard limit caused by
multiple scattering. Such a thickness limit would not ap-
ply to XDM so the question becomes: can XDM achieve
good enough resolution to produce images with similar
quality to cryoelectron tomography but of whole cells in

the 0.5 to say 5-10 µm size range? A more fundamental
reason why the issue of resolution is important in these
investigations is that the resolution achieved by the Mu-
nich group is beginning to enable protein molecules of
known structure in the sample to be recognized. The po-
tential for determining the way in which these proteins
“dock” together and thus for throwing light on their func-
tion in molecular machines is an exciting general goal of
these types of ultramicroscopy.

The question of calculating how much dose is needed
for imaging in a given microscope at a given resolution
and statistical accuracy is essentially a statistical calcu-
lation. Such calculations have been presented before for
x-ray microscopy in general [15, 16, 17] and for XDM
[1, 18, 19]. On the other hand the question of how much
dose can the sample tolerate before unacceptable degra-
dation occurs to images at a given resolution is not a mat-
ter of statistics but rather of radiation chemistry and bi-
ology. We thus arrive at two important quantities that we
need to know about in order to estimate the dose-limited
resolution, the required dose for imaging and the max-
imum tolerable dose. Obviously experiments can only
be successful if the dose employed is greater than the
required dose for imaging and less than the maximum
tolerable dose.

In what follows we will use various techniques to esti-
mate the required dose and the maximum tolerable dose.
For the required dose we will use an estimation method
based on the so-called dose fractionation theorem [20, 21]
which we explain below. To use the theorem for a 3D
diﬀraction experiment one needs to know the scattering
strength of a single voxel. This cannot normally be mea-
sured but we will describe simple methods by which it can
be calculated and will compare the dose-resolution scal-
ing law that results with our own XDM measurements.
The maximum tolerable dose cannot be estimated by a
simple calculation so it needs to be inferred from experi-
mental results. We discuss below various experiments by
ourselves and others that may be able to provide infor-
mation. Since no 3D images of biological samples have
yet been made by XDM, we try to make the best use
of results from other types of experiment, 2D XDM, x-
ray and electron crystallography and conventional elec-
tron and x-ray microscopy. Using these methods we will
make tentative estimates of the future capability of XDM
based on the presently-available evidence.

THE DOSE FRACTIONATION THEOREM

The theorem that we will use to simplify our calcula-
tion of the required dose for imaging was ﬁrst proved by
Hegerl and Hoppe [20]. It states, “A three-dimensional
reconstruction requires the same integral dose as a con-
ventional two-dimensional micrograph provided that the
level of (statistical) signiﬁcance and the resolution are

2

identical”. The discussion provided by the originators
of the theorem was largely in terms of a single voxel
but, as pointed out by McEwan, Downing and Glaeser
[21], the conclusion can be immediately generalized to
a full 3D object by recognizing that conventional tomo-
graphic reconstructions are linear superpositions of the
contributions of the individual voxels. A similar argu-
ment can be used to show that the theorem is applicable
to XDM. McEwan et al also showed by computer sim-
ulations that the validity of the theorem could be ex-
tended to include experimentally realistic conditions of
high absorption, signal-dependent noise, varying contrast
and missing angular range.

We consider a single voxel of the type that we would
reconstruct in a fully 3D experiment, which means one
with the same width in all three dimensions.
In order
to apply the theorem to predict the “required dose for
imaging”, we need to know the dose required in an XDM
experiment on the single voxel alone for an interesting
range of values of d. It would be extremely hard to do
such a series of experiments in practice. However, since
the one-voxel experiments are simple in principle, it is
easy to obtain their results by theoretical analysis which
is what we do below. We will study a voxel of size d× d×
d which corresponds to correct sampling for resolving a
smallest spatial period of 2d in each coordinate direction
(roughly similar to a Rayleigh resolution of d in standard
microscopy).

To obtain the dose required for the one-voxel experi-
ment we begin by calculating the x-ray coherent scatter-
ing cross section (σs) of the voxel for scattering into a
detector with the right solid-angle collection to get the
resolution d. This gives the dose required to get a given
number of x-rays scattered by the voxel into the detector.
The refractive index ˜n = 1 − δ − iβ, the intensity absorp-
tion coeﬃcient µ, and the complex electron density ˜ρ that
we will need can be obtained from the tabulated optical
constants as described, for example, in [22] equations 17,
18, 23 and 19 respectively.

CALCULATION OF THE COHERENT
SCATTERING CROSS SECTION OF THE VOXEL

Suppose the voxel is of amplitude transparency T sur-
rounded by empty space of transparency unity. The
Babinet inverse of this scattering object is an aperture
of transparency 1 − T in an opaque screen. Babinet’s
Principle asserts that, outside the (small) area of the in-
cident beam, the diﬀraction pattern of these two objects
is the same. The diﬀracted intensity at distance zis most
easily calculated for the second object [23] as follows:

I (x, y) =

Iin |1 − T |2 d4
λ2z2

(cid:18)

The numerical aperture required to resolve a spatial

period 2d is λ/(2d) so the full width of the detector in
both x and y should be w = λz/d. Thus

showing that σs = |1 − T |2 d2 which is in agreement with
equation 23 of [24] for example, as well as being intu-
itively reasonable. To get the complex absorbency, 1 − T
in terms of the material properties of the voxel we use
[22] equation (20) for the wave amplitude ψ:
−2πi˜nd/λ = ψ0 e
−2πid/λe

−2πi(1−β−iδ)d/λ ,
−2πβd/λe2πiδd/λ, whence

ψ = ψ0 e
= ψ0 e

T = e

−2πβd/λe2πiδd/λ ≃ 1 − 2πd (β + iδ) /λ ,

introduced the weak-phase-weak-
where we have
amplitude approximation (which will usually be valid for
a resolution element which is intrinsically small). Recast-
ing this in terms of the complex electron density ˜ρ, ([22]
equation 19), we have:

|1 − T |2 = (2πd)2 |β + iδ|2

λ2 = d2r2

e λ2 |ρ|2 ,

.

and ﬁnally,

σs = |1 − T |2 d2 = r2

e λ2 |ρ|2 d4 .

(1)

Thus σs scales as the voxel size to the fourth power. As
we will see this leads to an inverse fourth-power scaling
of the dose with d. The scaling with wavelength is dom-
inated by the lamda-squared term, especially at wave-
lengths ≪ 2 nm where the ˜ρ values of the light elements
approach a constant value.

Equation (1) is important to our argument and we have
checked it in various ways. Firstly, we took the scattering
cross section of a single electron and summed it coher-
ently over all the electrons in our voxel. Secondly we
used literature calculations of the cross section of spher-
ical particles of the same size as our voxel [25, 26]. The
three expressions so obtained agreed with equation (1)
up to a constant factor of order one. We may also ar-
gue that the contrast (C) between the voxel and vacuum
scales as the thickness, i. e. as d. The Rose criterion (see
later) says that the number of incident x-rays per unit
area, N0, which is proportional to the dose, must satisfy
C2. Therefore, since C scales as d, N0 scales
N0d2 > 25
as 1

RELATION BETWEEN FLUX DENSITY AND
DOSE

Before proceeding to calculate the dose for our case
we ﬁrst make some deﬁnitions and show how the dose is

3

related to the number of incident particles per unit area.
This relationship will be needed in order to compare pub-
lished data from diﬀerent sources. For x-rays of energy
hν, we know that for any object (with density ε), the
number of transmitted x-rays per unit area N at depth
t due to an incident number per unit area N0 is given
by N = N0 exp (−µt) whence the energy deposition per
unit volume at the surface, [∂ (N hν) /∂t]t=0, is µ N0hν.
Therefore the dose D (energy deposited per unit mass)
is:

D = µN0hν/ε .

(2)

D will be in Gray (J/kg) if the other quantities are in
MKS units. The last equation relates the incident parti-
cle ﬂux density to the dose for given material parameters
irrespective of d. Some numerical values for protein are
given in Fig. 1.

In the case of illumination by an electron beam, the en-
ergy deposited per unit length of trajectory (and thence
per unit volume) is given by the Bethe formula, (see for
example equation 10.2 of [27]) which we have used for
some of the entries in Fig. 4.

ESTIMATION OF THE DOSE AND
CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED IMAGING
DOSE

We want to estimate the dose D (Gy) and the num-
ber of incident x-rays per unit area N0 required to get
a given number P of x-rays scattered into the detector
from the given voxel (The choice of P will be determined
by the statistical accuracy required from the measure-
ment). The number of photons incident on the voxel is
d2 will be scattered into the
N0d2 of which a fraction σs
detector. Therefore the requirement is for N0 = P /σs
(cid:14)
which, from equations (1) and (2), leads to:

As examples we show the ﬂux and dose curves
2) for a protein sample of empirical formula
(Fig.
H50C30N9O10S1 and density 1.35 gm/cm3 as a function
of x-ray energy. The curves are for a voxel size (resolu-
tion) of 10 nm and statistical accuracy based on the Rose
criterion [28]. The latter is an experimentally-based cri-
terion for reliable detectability of a feature against back-
ground noise. The requirement is generally that the fea-
ture signal should be ﬁve times greater than the rms
background noise. When the noise is the shot noise of
the feature signal itself then it is conventional to set the
particle count equal to 25. The ﬂux curve (Fig. 2(a)) is
dominated by the λ−2 scaling of the cross section. This
argues for using the longest possible wavelength for these
experiments. On the other hand the wavelength should
be shorter than, say, a quarter to a half of the resolution
so that the diﬀraction angle is not too large, and short
enough that the sample is a weak absorber (< 20%, say),
so that data analysis can proceed on the basis of the
Born approximation. Unlike the ﬂux, the dose does not
show strong energy dependence above about 1 keV. This
is because the roughly λ5/2 scaling of the absorption co-
eﬃcient tends to cancel the wavelength dependence of
hν/σs in equation (3).

Equation (3) also allows the calculation of the “re-
quired imaging dose” as a function of resolution d. We
have evaluated that for protein against a background of
water for 1 keV and 10 keV as shown by the solid and
dashed straight lines in Fig. 4. One can see that the
change in dose from 1 keV to 10 keV is not very signiﬁ-
cant.

Also from (3) the resolution scaling of the dose is
d4 and is determined entirely by the cross
seen to be 1

(cid:14)
may say that the same dose will be required to measure

Rose criterion.

the same d×d×d voxel to the same statistical accuracy in
a 3D tomography experiment. Hence, the inverse-fourth-
power scaling with d, will also apply to a 3D sample.

It is important to note that the ﬂux, predicted by Fig.
2 to be required for a 10 nm XDM experiment on protein
against a background of water, needs to be delivered to
the sample as a coherent x-ray beam. Part of the attrac-
tion of XDM is that such coherent x-ray beams are al-
ready available from undulators on current synchrotron-
radiation sources such as the Advanced Light Source at
Berkeley USA. For example our present experiments are
done using exposure times of several tens of seconds per

view in a tomographic tilt series using a general-purpose
beam line. The use of a purpose-designed beam line plus
the soon-to-be-completed ALS upgrade would improve
that by a factor of about a thousand.

MEASUREMENTS OF THE REQUIRED
IMAGING DOSE

In order to test the calculations of the required imag-
ing dose we have carried out the following series of mea-
surements. Two-dimensional diﬀraction patterns were
recorded using a series of exposure times that increased
on a logarithmic grid. The patterns were analyzed by
ﬁrst taking an azimuthal average so as to produce a re-
lation between diﬀracted signal and spatial frequency. A
cut-oﬀ frequency was then determined from where the
diﬀracted signal reached the noise ﬂoor of the detector.
The exposure times were converted to dose units and
the cut-oﬀ frequencies to spatial half-periods giving a
relation between dose and resolution. One of these re-
lationships, taken using freeze-dried yeast, is plotted in
Fig. 4 (crosses). It shows that the predicted magnitude
is roughly right (remember that the plot is for frozen-
hydrated material so the precise agreement shown should
not be taken too seriously) and the inverse-fourth-power
scaling with resolution is well reproduced. Another note-
worthy feature is that the plot follows a good straight line
on the log-log plot all the way up to the maximum dose
employed. We interpret that to mean that the resolution
was not compromised by damage up to the maximum
integrated dose employed. Furthermore we suggest that
the eventual departure from straightness of such plots
may be a good indicator of the onset of a loss of resolu-
tion due to damage. Although the data described above
and plotted in Fig. 4 are typical of the majority of the
data we have taken, we wish to point out that some of
our data have shown scaling laws that departed signiﬁ-
cantly from inverse-fourth-power, the lowest power so far
being -3.1.

MEASUREMENT OF THE MAXIMUM
TOLERABLE DOSE

Since the ninteen seventies [29], there has been strong
interest in understanding the role of radiation damage in
various forms of imaging of life-science samples. This has
been important in direct imaging by electron and x-ray
microscopes and in reconstructive imaging by methods
such as the single-particle technique [30] and by x-ray
and electron crystallography. During this time there has
been a continual growth in the power of electron and x-
ray sources and an interest in using smaller crystals in
crystallography and larger numbers of images in single-
particle work, all of which has generated a motivation

5

to push data collection to the limits allowed by damage.
Thus radiation damage studies are still very much on
the current agenda (see for example, the comments of
Henderson [31] and the review of a recent workshop at
Argonne, USA on the subject by Garman and Nave [32]).
Our task to judiciously apply the latest information from
these studies to the issue of determining the maximum
tolerable dose for XDM.

Three spot patterns from the series described
in the text recorded from the ribosome crystal. Many of
the spots seen at the beginning of the sequence (a) have

the end (c). The full sequence can be seen as a movie at
http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/∼jamesh/ribo blast/diﬀraction.gif

Our resolution goal in life-science XDM is set by the
considerations discussed in the introduction to be 3-10
nm. This does not correspond to the resolution goals
in x-ray or electron crystallography where much higher
resolution levels of 0.15-0.3 nm, that can lead to atomic-
resolution structure determinations, are usually desired.
In fact a signiﬁcant part of the x-ray damage literature
refers to primary damage; that is damage to the high-
est resolution structures. Nevertheless we have tried to
ﬁnd reports in the crystallography literature that have
at least some reference to damage at resolution values
closer to our range of interest and also give quantita-
tive spot-fading data. We have also added information
from imaging methods; electron tomography and single-
particle measurements as well as a few results from XDM
and x-ray microscope experiments to the compilation in
Table I and Fig. 4.

Although the data from the literature noted above
give quite a consistent picture as between electron
and x-ray measurements (as noted by Henderson [33]),
the x-ray measurements have a large gap in the res-
olution region of principal interest to us. This lead
us to carry out spot-fading measurements ourselves
using beam line 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source
at Berkeley. The experiments were done by J. M.
Holton using the established crystallography facilities
of the beam line with a ribosome crystal grown by
Prof. J. Cate of University of California Berkeley. The
total exposure at 10 keV x-ray energy was about 24
hours with high-dose-rate (wide-slit) exposures to do
damage alternated with low-dose (narrow-slit) expo-
sures to measure the spots. The spot patterns at the
beginning, middle and end of this sequence are shown
in Fig. 3 and the whole process can be seen as a movie at
http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/∼jamesh/ribo blast/diﬀraction.gif.
The following points can be noted.

• The crystal has a unit cell size a=b=693 ˚A, c=1388
˚A with space group I4122 and it diﬀracted out to
about 10˚A when it was undamaged.

• As the dose increased, the intensity of the Bragg
spots faded without increase of the spot size start-
ing from the highest-resolution spots.

• As the intensity in the (high-angle) Bragg spots di-
minished, that in the central (small-angle) pattern
increased strongly.

• The number and resolution of the spots which faded
for each increment of the dose was quantiﬁed by the
DISTYL software [34] as listed in Table I and Fig.
4.

• As shown in Fig. 4 the new results are consis-
tent with the earlier ones and, taken together, the
data in the resolution range 0.1–10 nm suggest an
approximate straight line on the log-log plot with

6

slope corresponding roughly to the linear relation-
ship: dose(Gy) = 108 × resolution(nm). The data
in this region are all from crystallography (electron
and x-ray) and electron imaging.

We now turn to the remaining data above resolution
10 nm. There are only three data points, all coming
from soft x-ray imaging experiments. Two of them dif-
fer from the other data in the sense that they represent
experiments in which damage eﬀects, meaning changes
to the image with increasing dose, were not seen. These
therefore represent only a lower bound on the maximum
tolerable dose. In the third (the furthest to the right in
Fig. 4) damage was not seen at 1010Gy but was seen at
5 × 1011Gy so that experiment did reach an end point.

FIG. 4: graph summarizing information on the required imag-
ing dose and the maximum tolerable dose. The reason why
experiments on crystals are seen to be done successfully with
around 108 times less than the required imaging dose is
that the dose applied to a crystal is shared among at least
that number of copies of the unknown object. The required
imaging dose is calculated for protein of empirical formula
H50C30N9O10S1 and density 1.35 gm/cm3 against a back-
ground of water for x-ray energies of 1 keV (solid line) and 10
keV (dashed line). Some of our measurements of imaging dose
are plotted as crosses (see text). The maximum tolerable dose
is obtained from a variety of experiments by ourselves and
from the literature as described in Table I. The types of data
from the literature are identiﬁed by the symbols as follows:
ﬁlled circles: x-ray crystallography, ﬁlled triangles: electron
crystallography, open circles: single-particle reconstruction,
open triangles: electron tomography, diamonds: soft x-ray
microscopy (including XDM), ﬁlled squares: ribosome exper-
iment (see text).

THE MEANING OF DATA SUMMARIZED IN
FIG. 4

The data summarized in Fig. 4 refer to two diﬀerent
dose levels; the required dose for imaging (the continuous
and dashed black lines), and the maximum tolerable dose
(the mostly isolated points forming a rough straight line
going uphill to the right). On the left-hand side of the
crossover of the two lines it is obvious that the required
dose for imaging (by XDM) is far greater than the max-
imum tolerable dose. This reﬂects the fact that XDM
experiments cannot be done at those resolution values.
Experiments that share the dose over multiple copies of
the sample (such as crystallography) have a major dose
advantage and, with enough copies, such experiments can
be done successfully up to the resolutions and doses in-
dicated in Table I and Fig. 4. Obviously the dose ad-
vantage factor of crystallography compared to XDM, in
which latter only a single copy of the unknown object is
available, will be related to the number of copies of the
unknown object contained in the crystal(s). However,
one would not expect the relationship to be simple be-
cause the degree of coherent enhancement would depend
in a complicated way on the experimental geometry.

Based on these understandings, the region of the graph
where XDM experiments could be expected to be success-
ful is the triangular region between the two lines to the
right of the crossover. The best resolution in the “good”
region is evidently at the crossover of the two “lines”. We
see that this is at around 10 nm.

DISCUSSION

Initial studies [35, 36] showed that cryo-protection was
quite successful in electron microscopy and crystallogra-
phy and a similar technique was later adopted as a stan-
dard method in x-ray crystallography [33] where it was
even more successful. The idea to extend cryo-protection
to lower temperatures including liquid helium temper-
atures [37] has also been around for some time in the
electron-microscopy community and there is some con-
sensus that modest beneﬁts may be obtained. The sit-
uation in the x-ray crystallography community is still
much more uncertain. The Argonne workshop cited
above had several papers on the subject without reach-
ing a clear conclusion [32]. On the other hand, a recent
paper by Teng and Moﬀat [38]assessing the range 40-
150˚K provided convincing evidence that temperatures
below 150˚K provide no improvement in the dose limit
for primary radiation damage. However, they did ﬁnd
improvement in the dose limit for secondary and tertiary
damage which is in a poorer-resolution range than pri-
mary damage. This suggests that helium temperatures
might be useful for x-ray experiments in our resolution
range. Although the available (non-XDM) evidence is

7

not unanimous on this point, we would like to explore it
experimentally for XDM. However, for the moment we
are only equiped for liquid-nitrogen temperature.

The work that we are doing consists of an active pro-
gram of studies of yeast cells as a model sample and it
is one of our goals to determine the maximum tolerable
dose in that context. We are also developing the tech-
nique of measuring and reconstructing tilt series using
radiation-hard samples of, for example, 50-nm gold balls
[1, 2]. At the time of writing we have recorded diﬀrac-
tion patterns at 750 eV of freeze dried yeast and have re-
constructed XDM images in 2D and stereo pair but not
3D from them. The reconstructed resolution currently
achieved with freeze-dried yeast is 50 nm with a dose
level of 2 × 107Gy. With frozen-hydrated yeast we have
520 eV diﬀraction patterns out to 25 nm resolution but
not yet a reconstruction. The freeze-dried samples were
overexposed to look for signs of radiation damage. No
degradation of the resolution by radiation damage was
seen in this experiment although some shrinkage was ob-
served. The shrinkage probably was a radiation eﬀect [39]
but we have not seen such shrinkage in frozen hydrated
samples which are our principal interest. Although the
yeast study is obviously not ﬁnished, the present paper
is being submitted now in the spirit of a progress report
to meet the deadline for the special issue of the journal.

CONCLUSION

Our work in this area has been directed toward under-
standing the resolution limit set by radiation damage in
the imaging of frozen-hydrated samples using XDM The
experimental evidence we have presented here suggests
that, if the maximum tolerable dose for XDM is similar
to that for the other methodologies represented in Table
I and Fig. 4, then we should be able to get to 10 nm
resolution with “Rose-criterion” image quality. This is a
prediction based on the assumptions noted, not a demon-
stration. At the present time this is as far as the data
allow us to go in predicting the future capability of XDM.
However, we believe that in the reasonably near future
we will have further experimental evidence to report.

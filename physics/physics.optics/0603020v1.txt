Electron spin coherence has been generated optically in n -type modulation doped
(In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) which contain on average a single electron per dot. The
coherence arises from resonant excitation of the QDs by circularly-polarized laser pulses, creating a
coherent superposition of an electron and a trion state. Time dependent Faraday rotation is used to
probe the spin precession of the optically oriented electrons about a transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Spin
coherence generation can be controlled by pulse intensity, being most eﬃcient for (2n + 1)π -pulses.

An electron spin in a single QD represents a qubit can-
didate that is very attractive for solid state quantum
information processing [1, 2, 3], as has been suggested
by long electron spin coherence times, T2 , measured in
bulk semiconductors.
[4] These long times are required
for performing a suﬃcient number of quantum manip-
ulations during which coherence needs to be retained.
Recent QD studies have demonstrated long electron spin
relaxation lifetimes, T1 , in the millisecond-range at cryo-
genic temperatures.
[5] This has raised hopes that T2 ,
which may last as long as 2T1 , [6] could be similarly
long, with encouraging indications to that eﬀect found
lately.
[7] For fast spin manipulation, rotations by Ra-
man processes are envisaged whose cross sections can be
enhanced by resonant excitation of a charged exciton.
[8] In a ﬁrst step, however, electron spin coherence must
be established, which recently was addressed in charged
GaAs/AlGaAs interface QDs.
[9] However, only rather
low excitation powers were used in those experiments,
so that coherent control of electron spin polarization in
form of Rabi oscillations did not occur.

In this Letter we demonstrate by pump-probe Faraday
rotation (FR) that electron spin coherence can be gen-
erated by circularly polarized optical excitation of singly
charged QDs. Resonant excitation creates an intermedi-
ate superposition of a singlet trion and an electron, which
after trion radiative decay is converted into a long lived
electron spin coherence. The coherence is controlled by
the pump pulse area,
E(t)dt , where E(t) is the elec-
tric ﬁeld amplitude. It reaches maximum for (2n + 1)π -
pulses [10], in good accord with our theoretical model.
Theory also shows that 2nπ -pulses can be used for refo-
cussing of the precessing spins.

The experiments were performed on self-assembled
(In,Ga)As/GaAs QDs. To obtain strong enough light-
matter interaction, the sample contained 20 layers of QDs
separated by 60 nm wide barriers. It was fabricated by
molecular beam epitaxy on a (001)-oriented GaAs sub-
strate. The layer dot density is about 10 10 cm −2 . For
an average occupation by a single electron per dot, the

structures were n -modulation doped 20 nm below each
layer with a Si-dopant density roughly equal to the dot
density. The sample was thermally annealed so that its
emission occurs around 1.396 eV, as seen from the lu-
minescence spectrum in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The full
width at half maximum of the emission line is 10 meV,
demonstrating good ensemble homogeneity. Further op-
tical properties of these dots and undoped reference sam-
ple can be found in Ref. [11].

In
the FR pump-probe studies [3] a Ti-sapphire laser emit-

maximum of
used, hitting the sample along z . The laser was tuned to
the QD ground state transition energy (see inset of Fig.
1(a)). The circular polarization of the pump beam was
modulated at a frequency of 50 kHz, to avoid nuclear po-
larization eﬀects. For detecting the rotation angle of the
linearly polarized probe pulses, a homodyne technique
based on phase-sensitive balanced detection was used.

Figure 1(a) shows the FR signal of the QDs vs delay
between pump and probe for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds.
Pronounced electron spin quantum beats are observed
with some additional modulation at high B . With in-
creasing delay time the beats become damped. The oscil-
lations at low B last much longer (for example, about 4
ns at 0.5 T) than the radiative trion lifetime of τr = 400
ps, as measured by time-resolved photoluminescence and
therefore are due to long-lived residual electrons. Three
features are to be noted:

1) The oscillation frequency increases with magnetic
ﬁeld as expected from the spin-splitting of electron states:
~Ωe = geµBB , where ge is the electron g -factor and µB
is the Bohr magneton. We have analyzed the FR dynam-
ics in Fig. 1(a) by an oscillatory function with exponen-

2) The spin beats become increasingly damped with
increasing magnetic ﬁeld, corresponding to a reduction
of the ensemble spin dephasing time T ⋆
2 , plotted in Fig.
1(c). The damping of the spin precession arises from vari-
ations of the electron g -factor within the QD ensemble,
causing an enhanced spread of Ωe with increasing B ,
whose impact on the dephasing time can be described by
+ ∆geµBB/√2~ . The solid line
[T ⋆
in Fig. 1(c) shows a 1/ B ﬁt to the experimental data
for T ⋆
2 , from which a g-factor variation of ∆ge = 0.004
can be extracted. From the data one can also conclude
that T ⋆
2 (0) is longer than 6 ns. The zero-ﬁeld dephasing
is mainly caused by electron spin precession about the
frozen magnetic ﬁeld of the dot nuclei in a QD. [12] The
net orientation of nuclei varies from dot to dot, and it is
these variations that lead to ensemble spin dephasing.

3) The additional modulation of the FR traces at high
ﬁelds is observable only during the trion lifetime and
therefore can be naturally assigned to the photoexcited
holes with a spin-splitting ~Ωh = ghµBB , where gh is
the hole g -factor. The analysis gives
=0.66 at
B =5 T. The decay time of this mode is 170 ps which is
signiﬁcantly shorter than the 400 ps decay of the electron
spin precession for this ﬁeld strength, pointing either at
strong variations of gh or at fast hole spin relaxation.

Line is guide to the eye.

The B -dependence of Ωh is shown in Fig. 1 (b), and
the hole g-factor vs B is given in Fig. 1(d). gh varies
with B over the studied ﬁeld range, while ge is constant.
In the range from 3 to 7 T, where the beat modulation is
detectable, gh decreases from 0.78 to 0.62. This depen-
dence suggests that mixing of light-hole and heavy-hole
states is signiﬁcant for the studied QDs. [13]

Figure 2(a) shows FR signals at B = 1 T for diﬀerent
pump powers. The corresponding FR amplitude is plot-
ted in Fig. 2(b) as function of the pulse area, which is
[ dE (t)] dt/~ in dimensionless units,
deﬁned as Θ = 2
where d is the dipole transition matrix element. For
pulses of constant duration, but varying power, as used
here, the pulse area is proportional to the square root
of excitation power, and it is given in arbitrary units in
Fig. 2(b). The amplitude shows a non-monotonic be-
havior with increasing pulse area. It rises ﬁrst to reach
a maximum, then drops to about 60%. Thereafter it
shows another strongly damped oscillation. This behav-
ior is very similar to the one known from Rabi-oscillations
of the Bloch vector for varying excitation power.[14] The
FR amplitude becomes maximum when applying a π -
pulse as pump, for which the z -component of the Bloch
vector is fully inverted. It becomes minimum for a 2π -
pulse, for which the Bloch vector is turned by 360 ◦ , and
so on. The damping of the Rabi oscillations most likely is
due to ensemble inhomogeneities of QD properties such
as the transition dipole moment. [15] These observations
are important input for identifying the origin of spin co-
herence.

This origin will be discussed in the following: The mag-
netic ﬁeld B
e x leads to a splitting of the electron
spin into eigenstates with spin parallel ( +x ) or antipar-
allel (
x ) to the ﬁeld. Disregarding the hole for simplic-
ity, for neutral QDs the optical pulses create electrons

A short pulse of circularly polarized light is a remark-
able tool for controlling coherently an electron spin in
a transverse magnetic ﬁeld. If the pulse length, ∆t , is
much shorter than the radiative decay time and electron
and hole spin relaxation times, it mixes the electron and
trion spin states into a superposition state, which is not
aﬀected by the corresponding decoherence processes. For
controlled resonant pumping as in experiment, the co-
herent superposition is uniquely determined by the pulse
area Θ . By variation of this area not only the electron
and trion state populations can be changed periodically
with period Θ = 2π , but even more important also the
orientation of the electron and trion spins S and J
can be controlled.

The control of spin dynamics by an optical pulse allows
for a fast spin alignment. In a QD ensemble, a small area
pulse, Θ
1 , induces a coherent spin polarization pro-
portional to Θ , as observed in shallow GaAs/AlGaAs
[9]. With increasing Θ , the total
interface QDs Ref.
spin polarization oscillates as does the Sz component of
each individual spin in the ensemble all of which oscillate
with the same period, 2π . The long trion lifetimes in our
QDs could enable realization of regime in which pulse of
rather low power, but long duration can be used to reach
these large pulse area without decoherence due to radia-
tive decay. This explains the FR amplitude oscillations
with pulse area in Fig. 2. Further, the Sx and Sy com-
ponents change sign with period 2π . This implies that
2nπ -pulses can be used for refocusing of precessing spins,
very similar to spin-echo techniques. [19]

Let us turn now to the spin dynamics after its ini-
tialization by the short pulse: The trion component of
the electron-trion coherent superposition decays sponta-
neously leading to the observed long-lived spin precession
of the resident electron. After the pulse, the oﬀ-diagonal
component of the density matrix, describing electron-
trion coherence becomes decoupled from the electron and
trion spin vectors, S and J , which are governed in-
dependently by two coarse-grained vector equations:

For an ensemble of QDs, the electron spin polariza-

bution of g -factors and nuclear conﬁgurations. At low
magnetic ﬁelds, the random magnetic ﬁeld of nuclei be-
comes more important for the electron spin dephasing
than g -factor dispersion, leading to dephasing during
several nanoseconds. [12] The rotation of the linear probe

Figure 4 shows the FR signal after a σ+ -polarized

experiment. At B = 7 T, the FR shows modulated beats
resulting from interference of the electron and trion pre-
cessions during the 400 ps trion lifetime. At B = 1 T the
beats are less pronounced because of the larger diﬀerence
between electron and hole g -factors. These results are
in good agreement with experiment.

In conclusion, we have shown experimentally and the-
oretically that pulses of circularly polarized light allow
for a coherent phase control of an electron spin in a QD.
The coherent control results in FR amplitude oscillations
with varying laser pulse area.

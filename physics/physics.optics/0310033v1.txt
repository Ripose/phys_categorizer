We have developed a new method based on two cavities containing χ(2) media to reshape optical
pulses by an all-optical technique. The system is entirely passive i.e., all the energy is brought
by the incoming pulse and uses two successive optical cavities with independent thresholds. The
output pulse is close to a rectangular shape. We show that this technique could be extended to high
bit rates and telecommunication wavelength using very small cavities containing current nonlinear
materials.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In optical telecommunications, multiple ampliﬁcation and attenuation of information-carrying light pulses leads to
an ampliﬁcation of noise which quickly deteriorates the pulse shape, and therefore increases the Bit Error Rate. To
overcome such a signal distortion, an active technique of pulse regeneration is used, which is usually performed by
opto-electronic techniques. The so called 3R regeneration implies a Re-ampliﬁcation, Re-shaping and Re-timing of
the pulses. An all-optical method to perform these diﬀerent regeneration functions would be potentially faster and
with broader bandwidths. Several methods have been proposed so far and are actively studied, based on third-order
nonlinearities or nonlinear ampliﬁers [1, 2] to implement this function.

Second order nonlinearities have not been studied so far to implement regeneration functions, in spite of the high
nonlinear eﬀects that they are likely to produce even at low input powers, and of their intrinsic ultrashort response
time. We propose here a passive and eﬃcient method for reshaping optical pulses which uses two successive optical
cavities containing nonlinear χ(2) crystals. We give the results of a ﬁrst experiment, which show that our proposed
scheme is actually able to reshape low power light pulses, performed at 1.06µm and at low bit rates. We also discuss
the potentialities of extension of our technique to real optical telecommunication conditions.

Our scheme consists of two non-linear optical cavities which have input-output characteristics with a threshold
behavior, and lead to a reshaping of the input pulse. The ﬁrst cavity has a minimum threshold : as in a laser or an
OPO, no signiﬁcant power exits the cavity below a certain value, P low
threshold of the pump power. As a result, below
threshold the transmitted power is zero. The second cavity has a maximum threshold P high
P low
threshold : an input signal with
a power above P high
threshold is transmitted with a constant value equal to P high
threshold. The total transfer function of the
two optical devices put in series is thus a steep Heavyside step function : with an incident distorted pulse, the output
pulse is close to a square pulse.

We begin in section II by giving the theoretical expressions of the transfer functions of the two cavities. Section
III is devoted to the description of the experimental set-up while in section IV we describe the experimental results
obtained at the wavelength of 1.06 µm. Finally, in section V we analyze the possibility to apply these ideas to pulses
having a wavelength of 1.5 µm and to very high bit rates.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

A. First optical system : the intracavity SHG/OPO

The ﬁrst cavity contains a type II χ(2) crystal, and is illuminated by a beam at frequency ω0, polarized linearly at
+45◦ of the crystal axes. The cavity is assumed to be at the same time resonant for the ordinary and extraordinary
waves at the input frequency ω0, as well as for its second harmonic 2ω0, and to have a single coupling mirror at both
frequencies. The well-known following equations [3] describe the nonlinear resonant coupling between the intracavity
amplitudes of the three interacting ﬁelds in the steady-state regime and in the case of exact triple resonance :

quantities at the second harmonic frequency. These equations are simpliﬁed if one introduces the rotated basis:

The intracavity second harmonic power is suﬃcient to generate an oscillation on the A− mode. The behavior
of the system is similar to an Optical Parametric Oscillator : the second harmonic ﬁeld is now clamped to its
threshold value while the A− power increases linearly with the input power. If one uses as the output of the
device the output ﬁeld orthogonally polarized to the input ﬁeld, and at the same frequency, Aout
− = tA−, one will
have a zero output below threshold, and a value rapidly growing with the input above threshold, which is the
behavior that we need in our reshaping device. It is worthy to note that the present threshold P low
threshold, equal
to T 2T0
for small intensity transmission coeﬃcients at both frequencies, T = t2 and T0 = t2
0, is the threshold of
2g2
a triply resonant OPO, which can be in the mW range in optimized conditions [6].

Two diﬃculties must be solved to operate this device. First, we have assumed perfect triple resonance to solve
the equations. This is not an easy condition to fulﬁll, as the ﬁelds A0, A1 and A2 see three diﬀerent indices in the
type II nonlinear crystal, corresponding to three diﬀerent optical paths. As all the frequencies are ﬁxed, we must
then adjust precisely three parameters of the system to fulﬁll the triple resonance conditions. Two parameters are
easily controllable : the cavity length and the crystal temperature, but a third one is needed. This last one could be
the setting of a variable birefringent system in the cavity. We chose another approach, which is to insert a quarter-
wave-plate (QWP) in the linear cavity, adjusted so that it induces a 90◦ rotation of the polarization plane for the
fundamental wave when it is crossed twice by the beam inside the cavity, and does not change the second harmonic
ﬁeld polarization. In this conﬁguration, for any crystal temperature, the eigenmodes of the cavity are automatically
(A+, A−). We need then to adjust only two parameters to ensure the triple resonance condition : the cavity length
and the crystal temperature. Secondly, we have assumed a degenerate operation for the OPO. This is one possibility
for the system. But a non-degenerate operation of the OPO can also take place, with signal and idler modes oscillating
at diﬀerent frequencies ω1 and ω2 such that : ω1 + ω2 = ω0. This regime of cascading has been theoretically studied
[7, 8] and observed [9]. Actually, the system will oscillate in the regime (degenerate or non-degenerate) which has the
lowest threshold. We will see in section IV A that one can ﬁnd conditions for which it is indeed possible to observe the
stable degenerate operation that is needed for reshaping without frequency change, which is necessary for practical
applications. A forthcoming publication will give more precise insight into the operation of this kind of optical devices
that contain at the same time second order nonlinear elements and birefringent elements.

B. Second optical system : a non-degenerate OPO

The second system consists of a standard, non-degenerate, triply resonant OPO. It is well known that, in a laser
above threshold, the gain is clamped to its threshold value by the condition that the saturated gain must equal the
losses in the steady-state regime. The same behavior occurs in an OPO, as can be seen very easily from its steady
state equations, which are very similar to eqs (1-3), except that now the input power is put in the cavity on the high
frequency mode :

where As and Ai are the intracavity signal and idler mode amplitudes (these two modes oscillating at diﬀerent
frequencies), Ap the intracavity pump amplitude, and Ain
p the input pump amplitude; rs, ri and rp are the amplitude
reﬂection coeﬃcients of the coupling mirror at the signal, idler and pump frequencies. For the pump ﬁeld, one has
assume that the cavity has two identical coupling mirrors, of amplitude reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients rp and
tp, one used as the input, the second as the output of our optical device.

Solving these very well-known equations [3], one ﬁnds that there are two diﬀerent regimes, depending on the pump

For Ppump < P high

Let us stress that here also, the pump threshold P high

threshold is the threshold of a triply resonant OPO, which can be
very low. But now the system is much simpler to operate than the previous one, as the frequencies of the signal and
idler modes are not a priori given (except that their sum is equal to the pump frequency). There is one more degree
of freedom than in the ﬁrst device, and the cavity length and crystal temperature are the only two parameters that
need to be adjusted to get the triply resonant condition.

C. Total system

If the two previously described devices are put in series, one obtains an overall input-output characteristics which
is sketched in ﬁgure (3). This curve is close to the one we need for pulse reshaping, except for the intermediate region
threshold < Ppump < P high
P low
threshold, for which the response is linear. The best reshaping will be obtained when this
central part is as steep as possible.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

The input beam is produced by a Nd:YAG laser at 1.06 µm (Lightwave 126-1064-700). In order to produce a light
pulse, we use an acousto-optic modulator to modulate the intensity of the transmitted beam (modulation frequency
3 kHz). To mimick the high frequency noise existing on the pulse, we superimpose on the enveloppe a high frequency

≈
modulation (

≈

100 kHz) and simulate the high frequency noise (ﬁg. 4.a).

The characteristics of the two cavities are summarized in Tab.I. The ﬁrst cavity has highly reﬂecting mirrors both for
1.06 µm and 0.53 µm. The pump at 1.06 µm is sent at a 45◦ angle with respect to the crystal axis. The output beam

is separated from the input by using a polarizing beam splitter in front of the optical device. At low input power,
it is ﬁrst converted in green light by a standard doubling process. When the intracavity green power is suﬃcient,
parametric down conversion occurs which transfers the power back to the pump wavelength but on the orthogonal
polarization. However, this system has a high threshold, above 600 mW in our experimental conditions. In order to
reduce his threshold, we have added a quarter waveplate at 1.06 µm inside the cavity. In that case, we observed a
much more eﬃcient intracavity second harmonic generation, and a parametric oscillation threshold could be as low as
300 mW . This fairly large threshold is mainly due to the fact that the reﬂection coeﬃcients were not optimized (in
particular, the green reﬂection coeﬃcients should be maximum which is not the case).

B. Non-degenerate OPO

This system has been described extensively in a previous publication [6, 10]. Let us brieﬂy mention here its main
features : A PPLN crystal with an inversion period of 30 µm is placed inside a symmetric cavity which has a large
ﬁnesse (over 200) for the wavelengths around 2 µm and a lower ﬁnesse at 1 µm (around 40). The crystal temperature

is kept close to the degeneracy temperature (parametric conversion between 1.06 µm and 2.12 µm) so that parametric
oscillation occurred for all cavity lengths within a pump resonance, because of the overlap between the oscillation
ranges of nearby signal and idler pairs of modes of wavelengths close to 2 µm [6]. The threshold was on in the order of
a few mW . This threshold was chosen to obtain a transmitted ﬁeld as close as possible to a square function : its value
is much lower than the maximum intensity at the output of the ﬁrst cavity to ensure a steep transmission function.
Let us also mention that in our experiment, the input and output mirrors for the 1.06 µm beam where not of equal
transmission. As a result the power of the transmitted beam was very small compared to the input one, and not equal,
as in the theoretical approach of the previous section. This is due to the fact that we used, instead of an optimized
cavity, an existing one as used in the experiment described in ref [6].

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A.

Intracavity SHG/OPO

Fig. 4 shows the input and output intensities of the ﬁrst device as a function of time. The maximum input power
on this cavity was 350 mW in order to be above the threshold P low
threshold mentioned above. It can be seen on ﬁg. 5
that the eﬀect of the cavity is close to a perfect ”high-pass ﬁlter”, as far as intensities are concerned : powers below
P low

threshold are not transmitted while those above this value are linearly transmitted.
A crucial point of the device is that the output beam (orthogonally polarized reﬂected pump beam) is at the same
frequency as the input beam.
In a ﬁrst experiment, we looked at the interference pattern between the input and
the output beam, and observed that there were no fringes when the second harmonic beam was not T EM00. Clear
fringes only appeared when, by a careful alignment and crystal temperature tuning, the green output was T EM00. The
frequency degenerate operation was corroborated by a second experiment, where we used a confocal Fabry-Perot cavity
to monitor the frequency of the output beam, orthogonally polarized with respect to the input beam. The confocal
Fabry-Perot cavity is formed by two curved mirrors with radius of 50 mm and reﬂectivity of 95% for 1.064 µm that the
free spectral range is 1.5 GHz. Figure 6 shows the output beam and the pump beam transmitted intensities through
the confocal Fabry-Perot cavity when scanning the analysis cavity at 60 Hz and scanning the self pumped OPO at
650Hz : this ﬁgure shows that, when the system is not perfectly tuned up, it oscillates in a non-degenerate regime and
generates sidebands around the pump frequency (ﬁg. 6, left), whereas one can ﬁnd experimental conditions for which
the down-converted output has the same frequency as the pump, within the experimental uncertainties (ﬁg. 6, right).

B. Non degenerate OPO

We have plotted on ﬁg. 7 the relevant intensities for the second cavity as a function of time : 7.a shows the incident
intensity, while 7.b shows the transmitted intensity. The output intensity displays a very clear clamping of the power
above the threshold P high
threshold, at a value equal to the transmitted pump power at threshold, typically a few mW . On
ﬁg. 8, the ”low-pass ﬁlter” (for intensities) eﬀect of this cavity is shown via its transfer function.

The peak that one observes at the beginning of the ﬂat top of the transmitted intensity is due to a dynamical eﬀect
of delayed bifurcation that has already been observed in OPOs when their pump power is scanned with time [11]. As
the incoming pump power increases above threshold, the onset of the oscillation is delayed by a time interval that is
larger than the characteristic evolution times of the cavity.

The complete experimental set-up is shown on ﬁg 9. The beam reﬂected by the intracavity SHG/OPO is separated
from the input beam by a polarizing beam splitter and sent to the non-degenerate OPO. The output beam intensity and
the experimental transfer function for the total system are shown on ﬁg. 10. One observes that the time dependence of
the output beam intensity is close to a rectangular pulse, and accordingly that the transfer function shows the desired
behavior with a response very close to a step function.

V. POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION TO VERY HIGH BIT RATES AT 1.5µm

In all-optical pulse reshaping systems, two parameters play an important role : the operating power and the response
time. In the present demonstration experiment, the incident power on the ﬁrst cavity is about 350 mW , which is
beyond the current powers of optical telecommunication pulses. This is mainly due to the fact that the ﬁrst cavity is
not optimized. Thresholds in the range of tens of mW could be obtained by using high quality materials and coatings
and optimizing the cavity parameters. The response time of our present system is rather long, of the order of 200 ns :
it is related to the cavity build-up time of the two cavities which are long cavities with rather high ﬁnesses. The most
important question for the future of our proposed technique is whether our system can be modiﬁed and optimized in
order to be able to reach very high bit rates, namely 40 Gbit/s, and at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.5 µm.
We will address this question in the present section.

Several nonlinear materials are compatible with the telecommunication wavelength, namely Gallium Arsenide,
Aluminium Gallium Arsenide, or Zinc Selenide. These materials posses very large nonlinearities, as large as 120 pm/V
in the case of Gallium Arsenide but they cannot be phase matched using birefringence.

The rising time issue is the most diﬃcult to solve.

In order to reduce this time, one must use small cavities,
and therefore shorter non-linear crystals, and/or lower reﬂectivities for the mirrors, two methods which have the

9

detrimental eﬀect of increasing the thresholds at the same time.

The threshold of a triply resonant OPO is given by

Pthreshold =

where Ti denotes the transmission coeﬃcient of the cavity for mode i, Lc the crystal length and χ is the non linear

where def f is the crystal nonlinearity in m/V , wi is the waist size, ωi is the pulsation and ni the indices of refraction
of the three interacting modes. Assuming the system is operated close to frequency degeneracy, that is ω1,2 = ω0/2
and that the pump, signal and idler indices and Rayleigh ranges are identical, the nonlinear coupling strength can be
expressed in terms of wavelength and Rayleigh length, as :

where the index exp denotes experimental values, λ0, (λ0)exp denote the pump wavelength in the vacuum, these two
wavelengths being diﬀerent due to the fact that our experiment was performed with a (λ0)exp = 532 nm pump while
a telecom implementation would require λ0 ≈
a function of the cavity rise time

If we also assume that the cavity length is equal to the crystal length, one can use the expression for the ﬁnesse as

1550 nm.

We now obtain the following formula for the ratio of the thresholds :

One obtains a counterintuitive result, namely that the threshold becomes lower as the crystal/cavity length dimin-
ishes. This is due to the fact that the ﬁnesse is ﬁxed by the value of the cavity length in order to keep the cavity lifetime
τ constant. A small cavity is thus desirable to obtain a low threshold as well as a short rise time. The experimental
values correspond to an optimized cavity containing a KTP crystal pumped by a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser at
532 nm generating signal and idler around 1064 nm yielding Pexp = 20 mW with nexp
1.8, (def f )exp = 3 pm/V ,
Lexp = 1 cm, (
F0,1,2)exp = 115. When one sets a cavity/crystal length of 10 µm, a rise time τ of 10 ps (compatible
with operating bit rate of 40 GBit/s), and a Rayleigh length of 10 µm compatible with the crystal length, one obtains
110 mW with the values corresponding to gallium arsenide (n = 3.4
140 and threshold Pthreshold
a ﬁnesse
and def f = 120 pm/V ). This value of the threshold is compatible with the values used in optical telecommunications.
The very short length of the crystal is also an advantage as one can have a crystal length equal to or shorter than the
coherence length of the material which partly removes the problem of phase-matching. It is important to note that
the variation of the threshold with τ is very fast so that a small increase of the rise time up to 15 ps leads to a similar
threshold using Lithium Niobate (n = 2.2 and def f = 20 pm/V ).

We have shown in this section that the realization of very short rise time systems for all optical reshaping is
within reach by developing current techniques and using available materials. However, because of the presence of the
resonance cavity, this system is only able to reshape optical pulses centered around a given wavelength.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that optical cavities containing χ(2) media can be used for all optical passive reshaping of
optical pulses. We have experimentally obtained reshaping with a threshold compatible with optical powers propagat-
ing in optical ﬁbers. We have shown that very fast response times can be realized using very short monolithic cavities
made of high nonlinearity crystals.

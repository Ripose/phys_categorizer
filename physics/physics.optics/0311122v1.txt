We investigate in this paper the imaging properties of an absorptive left-handed material (LHM)
slab. For a line source, a geometric explanation to the reason of the thickness limitation on an ideal
slab is given. For a lossy slab, the imaging properties are determined by the wavelength, the slab
thickness, the distance from the source to the nearer boundary of the slab, and the absorption eﬀect.
Varying the ratios between these quantities, the image width can be changed from wavelength to
subwavelength scale. In the former situation, the energy density is mainly concentrated at the two
image spots. In the later case, though image of subwavelength width appears on the focal plane,
however, most energy is located at about the two boundaries of the slab, and beyond the boundaries
the wave amplitude decays exponentially. The relations between the subwavelength imaging and
uncertainty principle is also discussed.

Negative refraction of electromagnetic waves by a
left-handed material (LHM), ﬁrst proposed in 1960s
by Veselago [1], has attracted strong research interests
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and generated heated debate[7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
Among all the phenomena that could happen in a LHM,
the most fascinating one may be the possibility of “su-
perlensing eﬀect” proposed by Pendry [2]; that is, a slab
made of uniform and isotropic LHM [1] with both the
permittivity ε = −1 and the permeability µ = −1 ac-
quires a negative refractive index n = −1, which makes
this slab a perfect lens. It can capture both the prop-
agating and the evanescent waves emitted from a point
source placed in front of the slab and refocuses them into
two point images, one inside and the other behind the
slab.

In Ref.

Recently, this superlensing eﬀect was questioned by a
number of authors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
[9], the
authors augured that negative refraction of energy ﬂow
implies the violation of causality principle, and a little
amount of absorption will largely deform the waves. In
Ref. [10], the authors showed that although there is am-
pliﬁcation of evanescent waves in an ideal lossless left-
handed medium, however, to avoid the divergence of the
ﬁeld energy inside the lens, it must be limited to a thick-
ness smaller than the distance between the line source
and the nearer boundary of the slab, thus perfect imag-
ing is impossble.
In addition, a little absorption may
destroy the negative refraction eﬀect completely. It was
then found that to make a left-handed material physi-
cally realizable, the medium must be dispersive or ab-
sorptive. In Ref.
[11], the recovery rate for a lossy slab
was studied, and the author showed that the image qual-
ity can be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the absorption eﬀect.
In Ref. [12, 13], the authors showed that the energy ﬂow
indeed goes to the “negative way” when passing through
the surface of an absorptive and dispersive LHM. In [14],

a slab lens of photonic crystal was considered, and the
simulation showed that negative refraction of energy ﬂow
does not contradict the causality principle. Further in
[15, 16], the concept of “constant frequency curves” in-
troduced in [6] were used to study the refraction behavior
of the waves in the the medium. Most interestingly, in
[16] an all-angle negative refraction photonic crystal slab
lens was designed to focus the light into a subwavelength
region.

Although the focusing eﬀect of a LHM slab lens has
already been studied by a number of authors, however,
in most previous studies researchers used some Finite-
Diﬀerence-Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The method
is easy to implement but the physical meanings of the
simulation results are not easy to be extracted. Thus
these simulation results cannot be considered as conclu-
sive. In some other studies the authors used frequency
domain method, however, they considered only one single
Fourier component of the ﬁelds. To get a deﬁnite result,
one has to sum over these Fourier components ﬁrst.

To avoid these drawbacks,

in this paper we study
the imaging problem using a spectrum decomposition
method. We ﬁrst decompose the cylindrical wave emitted
by a line source into a series of plane waves of diﬀerent
transverse wave numbers. By considering the boundary
conditions at the source point and the two boundaries of
the slab lens, we then can determine the transmission and
reﬂection coeﬃcients for each plane wave. These quanti-
ties are utilized to construct the ﬁeld functions in every
space regions. Our method does not adopt complicated
numerical skills, thus makes us easier to get the physical
insight. We also give a very simple geometrical explana-
tion to the reason of the thickness limitation for the slab
lens. Finally, we found that the concept of “image” for
a negative refraction lens system is very diﬀerent from
that of the conventional lens system.

We ﬁrst describe the setup of the slab system. We con-
sider the E-polarized wave, which means that the wave
propagation direction is parallel to the XZ plane. The
x axis is parallel to the two boundaries of the slab, and
the boundary near the source is the z = 0 plane. A cur-
rent line source J(r)e−iωt = ˆyJ0 δ(r − r0) e−iωt located
at r0 = (x0, z0) = (0, z0), z0 < 0, emits monochromatic
waves of angular frequency ω, thus both the E and H
ﬁelds get a time factor e−iωt. The E wave radiated from
it is Erad(r)e−iωt = ˆyA0 H (1)
0 (k|r − r0|) e−iωt, which sat-

wave and the speed of light in vacuum (outside of the
slab), respectively.

To calculate the total E(r) ﬁeld, we ﬁrst introduce the

and k2(z) = εµ ω2/c2 if 0 ≤ z ≤ d. ε and µ are the
permmitivity and permeaility in the slab, respectively.
To proceed further, the waves have to be decomposed
into various Fourier components [5]. Each component
has a deﬁnite kx. It is a plane wave with either a real
kz =
x, if |kx| ≤ ω/c, or an imaginary kz, if
|kx| > ω/c. In the former case we have a propagating
wave, and in the later case the wave is evanescent.

We now consider the ideal case of ε = µ = −1. Pendry
pointed out in [2] that a slab lens of this kind is a perfect
lens with n = −1. It focuses the propagating waves and
ampliﬁes the evanescent waves, thus can recover all the
information carried by the wave emitted from the line
source. Although Pendry in his derivation showed that
for a single Fourier component the lens indeed ampliﬁes
the evanescent wave and thus the amplitude of the wave
can be completely recovered, however, he did not sum
over these Fourier components to get a result of the total
ﬁeld.
In [10], the authors showed that if the thickness
d of the lens is greater than d1 = −z0, then the total
ﬁeld will diverge inside of the lens. On the other hand,
if d < d1, there will be no image at all. Thus perfect
imaging is impossible.

Although the thickness limitation discussed in [10] for
an ideal LHM slab lens is correct, however, it is strange
to believe that there is some physical principle that can
restrict the slab thickness, if a thinner one can be made.
To resolve this puzzle, here we give a simple geometrical
explanation to the reason of this restriction (See Fig.1).
Since the ideal slab does not reﬂect light at all [2], thus
the ﬁeld inside and behind the the slab are

Einside(r, t) = A0 H (1)

(13)

which leads to the boundary condition for g at z = z0:

The continunity conditions for the tangential components
of the E and H ﬁelds at the two boundaries of the slab
lead to

respectively. Here r1 = (0, −z0) and r2 = (0, 2d + z0) =
(0, 2d − d1) are the two image positions predicted by the
geometric optics. Now, if d < d1, then r1 and r2 are
respectively located outside and inside of the slab; that

is, they are virtual images.
In this case the ﬁelds are
ﬁnite everywhere except at the source point. However,
if we increase the slab thickness to d > d1, then both
images become real, and this contradicts the boundary
conditions. More speciﬁcally, a real image means a delta
function term, i.e., a line source. Since there is no any
other line source except the original one, we conclude
that the perfect imaging is impossible.

Put it in another way. The time-averaged Poynt-
ing vector S must satisfy the divergenceless condition
∇ · S = 0, thus there should be no singular point satis-
fying |S| = ∞ except the source point. Since in the slab
the wave vector k and S are antiparallel to each other,
thus the waves propagating in the 0 < z < −z0 and
−z0 < z < d regions must be “radiated from” and “ab-
sorpted by” the image inside the slab. This leads to the
wave phase mismatch at z = −z0 if A0 6= 0. From these
consideration we conclude that the thickness limitation
is a restriction originating from the boundary conditions
of this system, and it implies that the stationary state
(monochromatic waves) cannot satisfy these boundary
conditions simultaneously.
If we bend the slab, or use
a lossy slab, the boundary conditions become diﬀerent,
and this restriction may disappear.

Now we turn to the discription of the numerical results
for a lossy slab. The permmitivity and permeability of
the slab are chosen as ε = −1+iδε and µ = −1+iδµ; both
δε and δµ are small positive real numbers. With these
parameters, the g function can be calculated. We then
calculate the integral of Eq.(4) numerically as a sum. We
ﬁrst let kx = k tan θ, with −f π/2 < θ < f π/2. Here θ is
a reference angle, and 0 < f < 1 gives the cutoﬀ of kx[17]:
(kx)max = (ω/c) tan(f π/2). In this paper we choose f =
0.96, which gives us a (kx)max/k ≈ 16, large enough and
numerically implementable to give us meaningful results
about subwavelength imaging. The range (−f π/2, f π/2)
is then being discretized as ns = 3000 fragments, and the
dkx is replaced by k sec2(θ)dθ, with dθ = f π/ns.

Figure 1.

shows two typical cases for the imaging
problem. In case A (Fig.1(a1) to (a3)) the lens system
have two images, one inside and one outside of the slab,
and they have widths of the wavelength scale. Here we
have chosen z0 = −1, d = 2, λ = 2π/k = 0.3, and
ε = µ = −1 + 0.001i. We observe clearly that the
largest ﬁeld strength locates at the two images. How-
ever, there is also some surface resonance eﬀect near the

3

boundaries. As we decrease the degree of the absorp-
tion, a stronger surface reresonance eﬀect is observed. In
case B (Fig.1(b1) to (b3)) we choose z0 = −1, d = 2,
λ = 2π/k = 2, and ε = µ = −1 + 0.000001i. In this case,
the images become subwavelength scale. It is also clear
that the ﬁeld strength is very large at the two boundaries
of the slab. This implies that surface-plasmon-polariton
(SPP) plays important roles in this case. It is interest-
ing to note that, although on the focal plane the ﬁeld
strength indeed has a peak along the x-direction, how-
ever, there has no energy focusing around the image, and
in the z-direction the wave strength decays from the sec-
ond slab boundary. In this example the ﬁeld strength at
the focal plane is about only 1% of that at the bound-
aries.

This decaying behavior can be easily explained by the
uncertainty principle. According to this principle, we
must have the relation ∆x ∆ kx ≥ 1, here the ∆x rep-
resents the width of the image, and the ∆kx represents
the ﬂuctuation of kx. A subwavelength image is mainly
formed by summing over the Fourier components of those
z = ω2/c2, these compo-
x + k2
|kx| ≫ ω/c terms. Since k2
nents must have imaginary kz’s, this leads to the decaying
proﬁle of the ﬁeld strength.

In conclusion, we have studied the imaging properties
of a negative-refraction slab lens, using a spectrum de-
composition method. We have also given a simple geo-
metrical explanation to the reason of the slab thickness
limitation for an ε = µ = −1 negative refraction lens. For
an imperfect lens with a little absorption, we found that
both the wavelength size and subwavelength size images
can be formed.

An analytical expression for the self coherence function of a microcavity and
partially coherent source is derived from ﬁrst principles in terms of the com-
ponent self coherence functions. Excellent agreement between the model and
experimental measurements of two Resonant Cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) is evi-
dent. The variation of coherence length as a function of numerical aperture
is also described by the model. This is explained by a microcavity’s angu-
lar sensitivity in ﬁltering out statistical ﬂuctuations of the underlying light
source. It is further demonstrated that the variable coherence properties of
planar microcavities can be designed by controlling the underlying coherences
of microcavity and emitter whereby coherence lengths ranging over nearly an
order of magnitude could be achieved.

The last two decades have seen widespread use of optical microcavities, both for experimental physics and com-
mercial applications. Microcavities redistribute emission from an underlying source and depending on the ensuing
radiation pattern allow light collection for use elsewhere. Commercially available microcavity devices such as Resonant
Cavity Light Emitting Diodes (RCLEDs) use the planar microcavity geometry to increase the extraction eﬃciency of
spontaneous emission from materials with high dielectric constants.1 More recently microcavities have been used to
spectrally and spatially isolate quantum dot emitters to increase the eﬃciency of single photon production.2,3

Recent work on planar microcavities has identiﬁed the dependence of Numerical Aperture (NA) on emission proper-
ties such as spectral linewidth4,5,6 and coherence length,7 the latter of which is the focus of the following paper. Note
that, migration of these results to the spectral domain are trivial due to the implicit Fourier relationship with the
coherence domain. In addition to the choice of domain, the name coherence has been used, instead of time. Coherence
highlights the statistical properties of light and not necessarily to the time dependence of the emission process that
produces the light. This distinction between the light and the emission event that produced it is necessary for the
descriptions presented in this letter.

The coherence length is a relevant attribute of any optical device as it deﬁnes the length scales over which mutual
interference occurs. Applications such as Low Coherence Interferometry, for non invasive medical imaging8 (also known
as Optical Coherence Tomography ) and Optical Time Domain Reﬂectometry (OTDR), for ranging measurements in
optical components9 and surface mapping in integrated circuits10, rely on the coherence of source being both small
enough to eliminate coherent reﬂections from distant objects and large enough to examine detail on the relevant
length scale. The correlations of low coherence sources are also applicable to schemes of all-optical routing.11

The variable coherence properties of RCLEDs7 make them ideal as a light source for applications where a range
of length scales need to be analysed where previously, multiple light sources would have been required. This letter
examines the physics of variable emission coherence from planar microcavities and indicates methods by which this
aspect of commercial devices such as RCLEDs could be engineered. Although experimental results of RCLEDs are
used in this paper, the results are applicable to planar microcavities in general.

The coherence domain picture of microcavity emission requires the deﬁnition of the self coherence properties of a
light source. The self coherence function of an emitter, ΓE(τ ), deﬁned in Eqn. (1) is synonymous with the spectral
distribution function by the Wienner-Kinchin theorem.12

A derivation for Γ(τ, θc), the self coherence function of a combined emitter and microcavity system, is too involved
to be described here from ﬁrst principles. Instead, a key result from the spectral domain is used in combination with
the Wienner-Kinchin theorem. The emission intensity from an emitter microcavity system is given by the spectral
overlap of the optical transfer function of the bare cavity, H(ω, θc), which is a function of the angle relative to the
emission region, θc, and the ﬁeld distribution of the underlying source |E(ω)|2, which is assumed to be isotropic.13,14
I(ω) = H(ω, θ)|E(ω)|2

(2)

Therefore the coherence function for the microcavity can be written as a convolution expression:

Γ0 is the maximum microcavity enhancement for an emitter tuned to the cavity resonance at an angle θt,

Here TF (θc) and RF (θc) are the transmission and reﬂectivity of the front cavity mirror and RB(θc) is the reﬂectivity

of the back mirror; all function of θc, the internal emission angle.

Γ(τ, θc) can be greatly simpliﬁed by evaluating the deﬁnite integral. To do this, the underlying spectral distribution
of emission is assumed to be Lorentzian in nature corresponding to exponential decay in the time domain. The
transfer function of the cavity, H(ω, θc) can also be approximated by Lorentzians in the immediate vicinity of the
cavity modes, ωc(θc) as the free spectral range of longitudinal modes in microcavities is usually much greater than
the spectral width of the source.

Here ωE and ωc(θc) are the frequencies of the emission and cavity resonances respectively and τE and τc(θc) are
the coherence times of the underlying source and cavity resonances respectively. Note that τE and ωE are assumed
to be constant with emission angle. Since Γ(τ, θ) is not necessarily symmetric, consider the expansion of the integral
in Eqn. (5) for τ > 0:

Γ(τ, θc) =

exp (−i∆ω(θc)t − K(θc)t) exp (−iωEτ + τ /τE)dt

exp (−i∆ω(θc)t − K

Here, K(θc) = 1/τc(θc) + 1/τE and K ′(θc) = 1/τc(θc) − 1/τE. Evaluating the integrals of Eqn. (6) gives the self

The expansion of the integral in Eqn. (5) for τ < 0 gives Γ(τ < 0, θc) = Γ∗(τ > 0, θc). Such a symmetry is
necessary in this case so that the Fourier transform gives the real-valued spectral density function for cavity emission.
Examination of Eqns. (7) and (8) highlight the correct asymptotic response: If τc(θc) >> τE then Γ(τ, θc = 0, ∆ω(θc) =

These two limiting cases are also of particular interest to commercial applications. For τc(θc) >> τE is typically
required for lasing applications, Here, notice that the self coherence function, Γ(τ, θc) ∝ ΓC(τ, θc) is a function of
angle, however is solely dependent on the cavity. Engineering the cavity allows direct control of the lasing mode.
The second limit, τE >> τc(θc), has only recently become applicable in semiconductor devices with the advent of
devices that have isolated single quantum dot light sources.15,16 The spectrally pure emission from single quantum
dot sources within a microcavity will have coherence properties that vary weakly with angle since Γ(τ, θc) ∝ ΓE(τ ).
The control over emission direction is still available by engineering the cavity’s tuning.

For RCLEDs τc(θc) > τE, however, the diﬀerence is not large enough to reduce the dynamics to one of the cases
described above by Eqns. (9) and (10). The coherence model has been compared with experimental results for tuned
and detuned RCLEDs operating near 650 nm, the details of which can be found in Refs. 5 and 6. Angle resolved
spectra were sampled through a pin hole subtending a half angle < 0.2◦ at the device using a monochromator with a
resolution < 1 nm. These were converted to the coherence domain by inverse Fourier transform. The coherence length,
Lc(θa), measured with respect to the angle, θa in air, is deﬁned in Eqn. (11) is used to analyse the correspondence of
spectral domain measurements and the coherence model developed here.

The ﬁtting parameters for the coherence model are the coherence times of the cavity mode and underlying source,
τc and τE respectively and the relative detuning, ∆. Here, it is assumed that the underlying cavity coherence is
approximately constant with angle, a fair approximation for high index devices. Figure 1 shows the variation of
coherence length, Lc(θa) for the tuned (Fig. 1. (a)) and detuned (Fig. 1. (b)) samples. The broken lines represent
the limiting case of τc >> τE which is clearly an insuﬃcient description for both RCLED samples. The solid line is
a least squares ﬁt of the model and the three unknown model parameters. The correspondence of experiment and
theory is excellent for the lower angles. At large angles, it should be noted that optical loss from the doped regions
of the RCLEDs may cause the deviation from the theoretical trend. This is supported by the observation that the
deviations occur at the same spectral position, i.e. a relative shift in the deviation’s angular position of 15◦ due to the
relative device tunings. Table 1 shows the ﬁtting parameter values for the RCLED samples in terms of coherence time
(and spectral wavelength). This has been done as it is more natural to specify the detuning in terms of wavelength.

Good agreement is apparent between parameters of the tuned and detuned RCLEDs. In addition, the values for
the detuning closely match the design values of 0 nm and −6 nm for tuned and detuned devices respectively. The
trend itself is also of signiﬁcant importance; clearly interference between the cavity mode and underlying emission
only resolves to a peak in coherence at the tuning angle. This is only visible in the case of the detuned RCLED at
approximately 26◦, corresponding to a detuning of −5.5 nm.

In the previous study, the density of emission states within the numerical aperture of emission was taken into
account. Here, the density of oﬀ-axis states increases as sin θa. In addition, the diﬀerential change in solid angle
with respect to air dΩa = sin θadθadφ and the cavity dΩc = sin θcdθcdφ must be taken into account. By integrating
Eqn. (8) over solid angle, the variation of the self coherence function as a function of NA is given by:

Figure 2. shows the variation of coherence length as a function of NA for the two RCLEDs under investigation
evaluated using the coherence model with the parameters shown in Tab. 1. Although experimental results for these
trends are not available, they do follow the generic trend observed recently in Ref. 7. The square markers show the
coherence length extrema calculated from measured spectra at normal incidence and N A = 1 in an integrating sphere
oﬀering further conﬁrmation of the result.

The coherence properties of planar microcavities are modelled well by the coherence formula of Eqn. (8). Consider
therefore, using this formula to predict how large a range of coherence length variation can be engineered over useful
numerical apertures. The reader will notice, that a low NAs, when only a few of the transverse cavity modes are
sampled, the coherence is near to that of the cavity. Statistical ﬂuctuations within the cavity are small since the
cavity samples the emission source over a long time than its coherence time resulting in a sharper spectral line and
enhanced coherence properties. The behaviour is also seen for all other emission angles into air as the cavity lifetime
is approximately constant, however, the emission frequency does change with angle. At large NAs, each cavity mode
still samples the underlying emission over a longer time scale than the coherence time of the source, however, the
sampled emission is reconstituted spectrally, reproducing to some extent the underlying statistical ﬂuctuations. This
appears to be a fair description given the observations. Therefore, in order to create a larger range of coherence
variation in these device, the ﬁnesse of the cavity must be increased and the coherence of the emission source must
be minimised. Most relevant, however, will be to increase the cavity ﬁnesse, over which most control can be achieved.
To test this concept, consider varying the cavity ﬁnesse in the model for the tuned device discussed above. Fig. 3
shows the maximum and minimum coherence lengths for useful NAs for the RCLED device as a function of ﬁnesse
and for a range of device tunings. Here, useful NA must be stressed: The maximum coherence corresponds to the NA
through which at least 10 % of the device power emitted into air is sampled while the minimum coherence is limited
by the limitation of coupling optics set here at an angle of 60◦. These limits are illustrated at the top left corner of
Fig. 3.

Despite the restrictions on useful NA, a large variation in coherence length is apparent in this extrapolated example
as is evident from Fig. 3. Increasing the ﬁnesse by an order of magnitude, increases the maximum coherence length
by just over a factor of 4. The minimum NA is increased by nearly a factor of 2. The range of coherence lengths, on
the other hand goes from 10 − 20 µm to 20 − 80 µm such that it almost spans an entire order of magnitude.

It was evident in the result of Figs. 1 a) and 1 b) that the maximum coherence length occurs at the tuning angle
or wavelength. This behaviour is also seen in the results of Fig. 3 where the maximum coherence length occurs for a
tuned sample and indeed gives the greatest variation over useful NAs. Quantitatively, this amounts to a 2 fold increase
in maximum coherence for a tuned device compared with a 6 nm detuned, which would be used for greater power
extraction into large NAs. Clearly, high ﬁnesse, tuned microcavity devices provide the greatest coherence variation
over useful NAs.

The self coherence function for planar microcavities has been modelled using an analytical formula based on the
underlying self coherence functions of the emitter and microcavity. The correspondence of the measured coherence of
two RCLED samples and the coherence model described by Eqns. (8) and (12) is compelling. Firstly, a good function
ﬁt to the coherence lengths of Fourier transformed spectra sampled at discrete angles was found. Furthermore, the
same ﬁtting parameters reproduced closely, the coherence variation as a function of NA, by integrating over the whole
set of emission states.7

The central result of this analysis is the observation that the coherence of the device is dependent on the underlying
coherence of the cavity and emitter. Indeed the underlying statistical ﬂuctuation of the light source are exposed when
varying NA. At low NAs, the coherence length is close to that of the microcavity. At large NAs, the coherence length
is closer to that of the underlying emitter. A key aspect of the modelling shows that the coherence properties of
planar microcavities can be engineered through microcavity design and selection of an emitter with suitable coherence
properties. Here, the model was used to predict a larger range of coherence variation by increasing the ﬁnesse of the
microcavity. Coherence lengths across an order of magnitude could be achieved if these design consideration were
considered carefully.

These observations suggest that variable coherence is a result of a ﬁltering mechanism; this is also the spectral
domain picture of microcavity emission. However, in the coherence domain, it is the statistical ﬂuctuations of the
light source that are ﬁltered by the slow microcavity sampling time. This is the only robust interpretation that can
reconcile the diﬀerence in coherence between planar microcavity emission viewed through small and large NAs and
raises questions about the relationship between the emission lifetime and coherence time in any type of microcavity
device.

Abstract

An accurate theory describing adiabatic following of the dark, nonabsorbing
state in the three-level system is developed. An analytical solution for the
wave function of the particle experiencing Raman excitation is found as an
expansion in terms of the time varying nonadiabatic perturbation parameter.
The solution can be presented as a sum of adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts.
Both are estimated quantitatively. It is shown that the limiting value to which
the amplitude of the nonadiabatic part tends is equal to the Fourier compo-
nent of the nonadiabatic perturbation parameter taken at the Rabi frequency
of the Raman excitation. The time scale of the variation of both parts is
found. While the adiabatic part of the solution varies slowly and follows the
change of the nonadiabatic perturbation parameter, the nonadiabatic part
appears almost instantly, revealing a jumpwise transition between the dark
and bright states. This jump happens when the nonadiabatic perturbation
parameter takes its maximum value.

I. INTRODUCTION

Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) resulting in the population transfer be-
tween the states which are not directly coupled [1], electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) via adiabatic following of the dark, non-absorbing state [2], nonresonant pulse exci-
tation of the two-level atom [3] are just a short list of phenomena in quantum optics where
adiabatic processes are considered. Generally, one can ﬁnd in any part of physics problems
concerned with adiabaticity, which are treated almost similarly. Among them we can men-
tion multiphoton resonances induced in atoms and molecules by a strong low-frequency ﬁeld
[4]- [7], wave-packet dynamics in physics and chemistry or, so-called, ”femto-chemistry” [8]-
[10] and slow atomic and molecular collisions [11]- [22].

A fully adiabatic process takes place if the Hamiltonian of the problem is diagonal. Then
any time dependence of this diagonal Hamiltonian does not change the state of the quantum
system except its phase. In general, the Hamiltonian, describing the interacting systems, has
both diagonal and nondiagonal components. In most cases dealing with adiabatic excitation,

1

the problem can be reduced to the consideration of the two-level system perturbed by the
diagonal and nondiagonal interactions. Then, both components of the Hamiltonian, i.e.,
the two-level splitting and the nondiagonal perturbation, are time dependent. One can ﬁnd
instantaneous eigenstates of such a Hamiltonian. These states are called adiabatic states if
the system, being initially in one of them, follows this state. In contrast, the initial states,
where the transition takes place, are called diabatic states.

The diagonalization of the instantaneous Hamiltonian takes into account the diabatic
states coupling, incorporating the interaction parameter into the instantaneous eigenvalues.
However, a new coupling appears again because of the time dependence of the transformation
from the initial, diabatic basis to the adiabatic basis (see, for example, [10]). Inasmuch as the
coupling between instantaneous eigenstates does not vanish, the following of the adiabatic
states can never be perfect. Since it is almost impossible to get rid of the state coupling by
the time dependent transformation of the basis functions, the choice of the adiabatic basis is
aimed to minimize the transition probability between the states, almost approaching in this
sense to the fully adiabatic Hamiltonian (i.e., the diagonal one) when the coupling can be
neglected. The estimation of the fraction of the system that is transferred from one adiabatic
state to another during the interaction (nonadiabatic correction) is a main problem in this
approach. This nonadiabatic correction is a measure of the nonadiabaticity of the process.
It should be obvious that the searching for the adiabatic basis is an approximate ap-
proach. It was developed for the ﬁrst time to treat the behavior of the two-level system sub-
ject to an excitation that couples the states if both the two-level splitting and the excitation
are time dependent. Only a few models of such a two-level system have analytical solutions.
Among them are the Rosen–Zener model with Hdiag = const and Hnond = V0 sec h(rt),
the Demkov–Kunike model with Hdiag = E + E0 tanh(rt) and Hnond = V0 sec h(rt) or
Hnond = const, the Landau–Zener model with Hdiag = λt and Hnond = const, and the
parabolic model with Hdiag = at2 + b and Hnond = const. Although the last model has not
an exact solution, it has been studied comprehensively (see, for example, Ref. [23]). Here,
Hdiag is the amplitude of the diagonal component of the Hamiltonian (i.e., the two-level
splitting) and Hnond is the amplitude of the nondiagonal component (i.e., the coupling per-
turbation). The symbols V0, E, E0, r can represent arbitrary constants and t is time. One
can ﬁnd these models and their solutions in, for example, [10].

The advantage of these models comes from the possibility to reduce their Schr¨odinger
equations to second order diﬀerential equations (with time dependent coeﬃcients) whose so-
lutions are known. For example, the Schr¨odinger equation for the Rosen-Zener model can be
reduced to an equation whose solution is the hypergeometric function and the Schr¨odinger
equation for the Landau-Zener model can be solved in terms of parabolic cylinder functions.
For an arbitrary Hamiltonian, the quasi-classical approach based on the Wentzel-Kramers-
Brillouin (WKB) approximation was developed by Dykhne [24]– [25]. In this method, the
amplitude of the nonadiabatic transition is calculated under the assumption that the adia-
batic levels cross in the complex time plane and the main contribution of the nonadiabatic
coupling is given at the time of the level crossing. The latter is usually the branch point
of the phase integral of the energies. The result becomes universal, i.e., independent of the
nonadiabatic coupling model and it is suﬃcient to take the leading term of the coupling at
the crossing point.

In this paper we consider adiabatic following of the dark, nonabsorbing state in the

2

three-level system excited by two resonant ﬁelds. The adiabatic following of the dark state
results in STIRAP (population transfer). It was proposed in Ref. [26] where the so called
counterintuitive Raman pulse sequence emerged as a result of the search for the generaliza-
tion of the Liouville equations for the N-level system using SU(N) coherence vector theory
[27]– [26]. This pulse sequence consists of two ﬁelds coupling two low energy levels 1 and
2 with one common excited state 3. If one of the levels (for example, 2) is initially empty,
then applying ﬁrst the ﬁeld which couples this state with level 3, and then the ﬁeld coupling
the populated state (for example, 1) with 3, it is possible to transfer the population of state
1 to state 2, without appreciably populating the intermediate state 3.

Later, the importance of the adiabaticity in the counterintuitive pulse sequence devel-
opment was realized in [29]– [31]. There is a particular superposition of states 1 and 2 that
does not interact with the coupling ﬁelds and, if the development of the ﬁeld amplitudes
in time is properly chosen, this superposition state changes from state 1 to state 2. If the
three-level atom follows this superposition state, the atom population is transferred from
state 1 to state 2 by the pulse sequence without populating the intermediate excited state 3.
This noncoupled superposition state was ﬁrst introduced by Arimondo [32] to explain qual-
itatively the dark resonance as population trapping in this state [33]– [35]. The noncoupled
state is often referred to as a dark state.

→

It is obvious that, if the dark state changes in time, a process must exist which tends
to empty this state. The condition minimizing the dark state depopulation is formulated
in [29]. This is done ad hoc, without an estimation of the nonadiabatic correction for the
excited probability amplitude. However, numerical calculations show that, if this condition
is satisﬁed, the adiabatic population transfer 1
2 is almost perfect. Some attempts were
undertaken to ﬁnd a rigorous justiﬁcation of the intuitively found adiabaticity condition and
to estimate the amplitude of the excited state during the STIRAP pulse sequence (see, for
example, Refs. [36]– [37]). In [36], the so called ramp pulses were considered, which allow an
exact solution. Furthermore, with the help of the method developed for the two-level system
by Dykhne (see the discussion above and Refs. [38]– [39]), the nonadiabatic amplitude of
the excited state 3 is estimated for Gaussian and hyperbolic secant pulses. This is possible
because the Liouville equation for the two-level atom in terms of the SU(2) coherence vector
(Bloch-vector model, see, for example, [40]) coincides with the Schr¨odinger equation for the
state probability amplitudes of the three-level atom excited by two resonant ﬁelds (see, for
example, [31], [36], [2]). However, the authors of [36] admit that the analytical approxi-
mations for the nonadiabatic corrections ”have been introduced ad hoc without derivation”
and they ”would really like to see more detailed investigations of the analytic behavior of the
system discussed”.

Fleischhauer with coauthors [37] developed a diﬀerent approach introducing higher-order
trapping states. They deﬁne a nth–order generalized adiabatic basis, which is similar to
the superadiabatic basis introduced for the two-level system in [41]– [44]. By successive
transformations from the diabatic basis to the adiabatic basis, then from this adiabatic
basis, which can be considered as the adiabatic basis of the ﬁrst order, to the next, i.e.,
the second order adiabatic basis, etc., the solution is presented as an inﬁnite product of
transformations. The general expression for the n-th transformation matrix is presented.
However, it is hard to implement this scheme for an arbitrary pulse sequence.

In this paper we develop a new method that allows us to calculate the adiabatic and nona-

3

diabatic components of the solution with controllable accuracy. The adiabatic component
describes the part of the atomic probability amplitude visiting the excited atomic state dur-
ing the pulse train and coming back to the dark state when the pulses are gone. The atom
evolution following the adiabatic component of the solution resembles the excitation–de-
excitation process induced by a soliton in the two-level atom. The nonadiabatic component
is that part which is lost from the dark state and describes the fraction of the atomic prob-
ability amplitude that is left excited after the pulse train. We compare our result with the
previous theories reported in [36] and [37]. We found corrections to the theory presented
in [36] and show that our result corresponds to the calculation of the inﬁnite number of
transformations proposed in [37]. As an example of the validity of the method, we present
also the solution of the Rosen–Zener and Landau-Zener models by our method (see the
Appendix and the end of Sections VI and VII).

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the general formalism employed
in the description of the three-level atom excited by two resonant ﬁelds. The transformation
to the basis of the bright and dark states is derived. It is shown that the system evolves
between two states, i.e., ”bright” and ”common” (they are speciﬁed in Section II). In Sec.
III we consider the time evolution of the atomic state vector for the Λ-scheme of excitation
if the ﬁeld amplitudes are time dependent. Bloch-like equations are derived. In Sec. IV the
adiabatic following approximation is presented. The adiabatic solution for the stimulated
Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is found in Sec. V. Nonadiabatic corrections are de-
scribed in Sec. VI. The case when the Raman Rabi frequency changes in time is considered
in Sec. VII-IX.

II. THREE-LEVEL ATOM INTERACTING WITH TWO RESONANT FIELDS.
GENERAL FORMALISM

We consider a three-level atom shown in Fig. 1 (a). The arrows indicate the transitions
induced by the coherent ﬁelds. This excitation scheme is classiﬁed as the Λ scheme. We
deﬁne the level that is common for both transitions as 3. The others are designated by the
numbers 1 and 2, level 2 being of higher energy than 1 and initially not populated. The
dynamic part of the Hamiltonian of this three-level atom, excited by two resonant ﬁelds
E1(t) = E1 cos(Ω1t + ϕ1) and E2(t) = E2 cos(Ω2t + ϕ2), is

Figure 1 (b) shows the excitation scheme in the dbc–basis where only the b and c states are
coupled. The b and c states do not correspond to a deﬁned energy. To present schematically
the dbc states and the transitions between them, we choose the state population before the
excitation for their relative position in the diagram. So, the vertical scale in Fig. 1 (b)
represents the initial population of the states counted from the bottom to the top.

The Hamiltonian in the dbc-basis, Eq. (15), resembles the interaction Hamiltonian of
the two-level system bc, excited by one resonant ﬁeld with an eﬀective interaction constant
B. The dynamic evolution of the atom is described by the Schr¨odinger equation with this
Hamiltonian containing only the transition operators between states b and c. If, for example,

Suppose that the pulse duration of the bichromatic ﬁeld, t2π, is chosen such that the
eﬀective two-level system bc experiences a so called 2π-pulse, i.e., χRt2π = 2π. During the
ﬁrst half of the pulse, the population of level b is completely transferred to state c. During
the second half of the pulse, the population of the excited state c is transferred back to state
b. The state vector of the atom at the end of the pulse is

Equation (21) shows that the 2π-pulse results in a π phase shift of the b state probability
amplitude. Usually, for the simple two-level atom, this π phase shift of the ground state
after a 2π-pulse is not revealed in the observables. In our case, apart from the two levels
b and c, we have the third level d whose phase is well deﬁned with respect to the phase of
state b. The phase deﬁnition is determined by the phase relation of the components of the
bichromatic ﬁeld [see comments after Eq. (20)]. In section IV we show the importance of
this point.

The coincidence of the equations enables us to use the adiabatic following approach de-
veloped by Crisp [3] to describe nonresonant excitation of the two-level system. A similar
approach was applied by Laine and Stenholm (LS) [36] based on the ideas of the adiabatic
following developed by Dykhne [7], [25] for the two-level system with time dependent split-
ting and coupling parameters. In the LS approach, [36], the instantaneous eigenstates of
the three-level atom excited by two resonant pulses are found. This basis is called the adi-
abatic representation. The transformation to the instantaneous basis [see Eq. (7)] and the
instantaneous Hamiltonian diagonal in this basis [see Eq. (6)] are time dependent. There-
.
Q Q−1, also appears in their consideration. In spite of
fore, the adiabatic states coupling, i
being diﬀerent in structure, our Schr¨odinger equation in the changing dbc-basis and the LS
equation in the instantaneous eigenstate basis can both be reduced to the equation for the
two-level system. However, our equations (27)–(29) are in a one to one corespondence to the
Bloch equations while the LS equations match the equations for the two-level density matrix
ρee. Although this diﬀerence is not crucial, it brings, however,
elements ρeg, ρge and ρgg −
some convenience in our case, because our equations are expressed for real quantities.

IV. ADIABATIC FOLLOWING APPROXIMATION

Crisp gave in his paper [3] a qualitative and quantitative description of the adiabatic fol-
lowing approximation for the two-level atom excited by a nonresonant ﬁeld. The qualitative
explanation employs the Bloch-vector model as follows. The Bloch equations can be written
in the form

if the relaxation times T1 and T2 are very long compared with the pulse duration. The Bloch
vector R is given by

and the eﬀective ﬁeld Hef f is

Equation (33) has the geometric interpretation that the Bloch vector tries to precess about

with the rate of change of the ﬁeld χ(t).
If initially the Bloch-vector points parallel or
antiparallel to ez [X(0) = Y (0) = 0 and Z(0) =
1], then precessing with high frequency
about the eﬀective ﬁeld, the Bloch-vector remains nearly parallel or antiparallel to the
∆
|
|
eﬀective ﬁeld as it moves adiabatically. Qualitatively, adiabatic movement of the vector
Hef f means that the Bloch-vector does not slip oﬀ from the direction of the eﬀective ﬁeld
if the rotation of the Bloch-vector around the Hef f –ﬁeld is much faster than the change
of the Hef f –ﬁeld direction. Quantitatively, this sets a condition that the precession period
Tp ≃
is to be much shorter than the time scale of the eﬀective ﬁeld variation. In
this limit, the angle between the Bloch vector and the eﬀective ﬁeld will remain very small.
The deviation of the Bloch vector from the eﬀective ﬁeld is described by the nonadiabatic
corrections. In the next section we consider how small this deviation angle is for particular
pulses.

The approximation of the adiabatic following allows also a quantum mechanical inter-
pretation. The Hamiltonian in the dbc time varying representation, Eq. (25), consists of two
parts. One part couples two, initially unpopulated states, b and c. The coupling parameter
B is time varying. The other part couples the populated state d with the unpopulated state

α is also time varying. In order that the atom is subject to the

V. ADIABATIC SOLUTION

The adiabatic following approximation can be applied to the consideration of STIRAP
and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) because in both cases the atom follows
the dark, noncoupled state. A ﬁrst attempt to study adiabatic following in EIT was under-
taken in Ref. [2]. In this section we consider the application of this approach to STIRAP.

It is expected that during this process the atom stays in the dark state. However, this state
itself changes since the coeﬃcients cos α and sin α of the development of the dark state in the
[see Eq. (12)] change in time. The parameter α rises from zero to π/2,

If we choose two identical, bell-shaped, delayed pulses having a hyperbolic secant shape,

then the interaction constants evolve in time as follows

Bn(t) = B0 sec h[r(t

where n = 1 or 2, tn is the time when the n-pulse has maximum amplitude, and r is the rise
and fall rate of the pulse edges. The mixing parameter α(t) increases monotonously if the
condition t1 > t2 is satisﬁed. This pulse sequence was considered by Laine and Stenholm in
Ref. [36].

Let us analyze the constraints imposed on the parameters r, t1 and t2 to have α changed
from zero to π/2. The mixing angle α varies according to the relation tan α(t) = B1(t)/B2(t).
For the pulse sequence speciﬁed above, an explicit form of this relation is

the product rT or the pulse separation T is. On the other hand, if the distance between the
pulses is large, the value of the coupling B(t) at t0 becomes small: the larger the distance,
the smaller the coupling. However, the adiabatic following demands a large coupling B
at t0. Therefore, one has to choose the optimum value of the pulse spacing satisfying two
conditions simultaneously. The distance between pulses is to be as large as possible to have
a small value of αin and, at the same time, B(t0) should be kept as large as possible. Below
we give some arguments how to ﬁnd this optimum value.

Section III]. For small values of rT , the time interval of the α change is small. For example,
if rT = 0.5, then cos(αin) = 0.855, sin(αin) = 0.519 and cos(αf in) = 0.519, sin(αf in) = 0.855,
which corresponds to the change of α from αin = 0.174π to αf in = 0.326π during the pulse
train. In this case only the fraction (0.855)2 = 0.731 of the atomic population is transferred
if the atom adiabatically follows the dark state. Another fraction (0.515)2 = 0.269
to state
of the atomic population participates in the process of excitation and de-excitation between
states b and c. This means that the population transfer via the change of the amplitude of
the dark state components is possible only if the time interval between the pulses exceeds a
certain value. We choose the value rT = 5 since in this case the initial population of state
b is 4.5

10−5 so that we neglect this population in our further consideration.

oscillations are not described by the main part of the adiabatic solution presented by a few
leading terms of the expansion.

Concluding this section, we refer to a particular case when B(t) and

.
α have the same
time dependence. This is again the case of matched pulses (see the beginning of Section
III), however in the dbc basis. Fleischhauer and coauthors, Ref. [37], classify this case as
second order matched pulses. The solution of the equations (27)–(29) is trivial since these

α (t0). For the
equations with constant coeﬃcients, where F (t) = B(t)/B(t0) =
ﬁrst time, this analytically solvable model was considered by Vitanov and Stenholm in Ref.
[50]. We would classify the case as nonadiabatic, however in the second order d1b1c1-basis,
where the transition takes place.
If the generalized pulse area is properly chosen in this
basis, the population transfer between the diabatic states 1 and 2 is complete. For these
particular pulse areas, there are no nonadiabatic corrections, which is typical for the resonant
nonadiabatic transitions.

VI. NONADIABATIC CORRECTIONS

All adiabatic terms tend to zero at t

, which secures for the three-level atom the
adiabatic following of a particular state coinciding with state d at t
. However, as it
will be shown below, if we sum all these inﬁnitely small terms, the result will be ﬁnite. The
net value of the small contributions of each adiabatic term is a nonadiabatic contribution,
which speciﬁes the excited probability amplitude left by the pulse train. To estimate this
value, we rewrite the solution, Eqs. (42) and (43), as follows

The semilogarithmic plot of fc(+

) versus B0, Figure 5 (a), clearly demonstrates that
the nonadiabatic part decreases exponentially with the increase of B0. Laine and Stenholm
[36] also found an exponential decrease of the nonadiabatic deviation from the ideal popula-
tion transfer with increase of B0T (B0 is the amplitude of each pulse at the maximum and
T is the interpulse distance, ﬁxed in our case by the relation T r = 5, so B0/r is a variable).
They followed the calculation procedure proposed by Davis and Pechukas [38] employing the
Dykhne model [24]. According to Ref. [38], one has to ﬁnd the zeros of the function B(t) in
a complex plane t and take the one, tc, that is nearest to the real axis. Then the population

We propose another calculation procedure of the nonadiabatic deviation. It will be shown
that there are two nonadiabatic contributions, one coming from the Rabi frequency B(t) and

α (t). Only the cooperative contribution of
another from the mixing parameter derivative
both determines the net nonadiabatic correction, while the Pechukas-Dykhne theory, taking
into account only the B(t)-change, underestimates the nonadiabatic correction.

calculation is nontrivial. For the case of secant hyperbolic pulses [see the time development
of the pulses, the Raman Rabi frequency and the mixing parameter in Fig. 3 (a,b)], it is

above, is related to the Dykhne-Pechukas model [24], [38].

For large β0, the Airy integral can be calculated by the saddle point methods as shown,
for example, in Ref. [54]. First, the stationary or saddle point ts is found where the phase

Ω(t) becomes stationary:

Ω (t) = B(t). For the case of the positive argument of the Airy integral, the saddle

In fact, there are two saddle points: ts =

point methods) is applied. This method is applicable to integrals of the form

where β0 is large and C is a path in the complex plane such that the ends of the path do not
contribute signiﬁcantly to the integral. The idea of the method is to deform the contour C
so that the region of most of the contribution to I(β0) is compressed into as short a space
as possible. This compression occurs at the saddle point.

Since the main contribution to this integral comes from the vicinity of the saddle point,
one may conclude that in the adiabatic limit the atom abruptly makes a nonadiabatic
transition between adiabatic states. This is very much like crossing a Stokes line for the
asymptotic series, and resembles the turning point problem in the WKB theory (see, for
example, Refs. [10], [54]). In the WKB method, the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation
is considered for a particle with mass m in a potential V (x):

In this approach the WKB connection formula, relating the

The Pechukas-Dykhne [38] recipe of the calculation of the nonadiabatic contribution
is similar to the method described above since the deﬁnitions of the saddle point ts and
the crossing point tc, where B(tc) is zero, are the same. However, in our consideration we

by the expansion near time t0, Eq. (66). Therefore, we have only two saddle or crossing
points, (79), whereas equation (80) has an inﬁnite number of crossing points in the complex
plane. According to Pechukas, one has to take the crossing point that is nearest to the real
axis. For the secant hyperbolic pulse train, this point, as shown by Stenholm [36], has only
an imaginary part Im(tc), i.e.,

in the method of the saddle point, the integration near the point is extended to

X. CONCLUSION

The introduction of the basis of the dark and bright states facilitates the understanding of
the physical processes in the three-level atom excited by a bichromatic ﬁeld. The dynamic
evolution of the atom between the dark, bright and common states is as simple as the
dynamics of the two-level atom excited by one ﬁeld with Rabi frequency B. This is because
the evolution of the three-level atom can be eﬀectively reduced to the evolution between two
states, i.e., the bright and common states. The reduction of the three-level model to the
two-level one allows also the application of the Bloch-vector model and Bloch equations for
the treatment of the three-level atom excitation by the bichromatic ﬁeld.

This quite simple algebra is applicable for the case of matched pulses. If the pulses do not
match in shape and have diﬀerent time dependencies, one can also reduce the consideration
to the Bloch-vector model since there is a similarity between the Schr¨odinger equations for
the probability amplitudes of the dark, bright and common states and the Bloch equation for
an eﬀective two-level system. The eﬀective detuning of the two-level system from resonance

following of the dark state.
In terms of the Bloch-vector model, the adiabatic following

excited by a sequence of pulses is described by simple algebra. The adiabatic population
transfer has a nice interpretation in terms of dark, bright and common states.

We developed an approximation describing the adiabatic interaction of the three-level
atom with two resonant pulses. The method of estimation of the nonadiabatic correction
is presented. It is applied to the case of two secant hyperbolic pulses. The adiabatic part
of the solution describes the excitation and de-excitation processes of the three-level atom.
The time dependence of the adiabatic part is smooth and follows the derivatives of the
mixing angle α(t). Both parts, excitation and de-excitation, are symmetric in time with

α (t) takes its maximum and they exactly compensate each other. In

mixing parameter
by the pulses because of the imperfect following of the dark state. Since this excitation
lasts only a short time, we consider the nonadiabatic process as a transition between the
ground and excited states, which takes place like a jump. The origin of the transition has a
simple interpretation. The parameter B deﬁnes the coupling strength of the bright (b) and

XII. APPENDIX

0 ≫

In this section we compare our approximate solution with an exact solution of the
Landau-Zener model if the parameters of the corresponding two-level system ∆ = 2λt and
χ = 2V0, satisfy the condition V 2
λ/2π. This condition is opposite to the one considered
at the end of Section VII. There, since the coupling V0 is small compared to the sweeping
rate λ of the two-level system splitting ∆ (V 2
λ/2π), the system adiabatically follows
the ground state g and the net population of the excited state e is small for t
. If
V 2
λ/2π, states g and e are not an adiabatic basis. To apply the adiabatic approximation
0 ≫
in this case, we have to choose a new basis that is adiabatic. This can be done if we use
again the similarity between the two-level and three-level systems discussed in Section II. We
consider the three-level system dbc described by the Hamiltonian (25) with the parameters
.
α= χ = 2V0. Then we make a S1–transformation to the new basis d1b1c1

no transition to the b1 state takes place and, ﬁnally, the system is left in the initial state d

but with the π-shift of its phase. This phase shift originates from the transition d
in the dbc–basis. One can ﬁnd that, according to Eq.(93), the system is in state d at t =
when α1 =

nonadiabatic correction, we can ﬁnd the probability amplitudes of states b1 and c1 left by
the interaction χ (coupling states d and b) after the level crossing of the equivalent two-level
system. These probability amplitudes allow to estimate the extent of the depopulation of
d
state d1. If the system adiabatically follows the d1 state, the state-vector changes from
i
. Since the development coeﬃcient Cd of the state vector in the dbc–basis corresponds
to +
i
to the Z–component of the Bloch-vector of the equivalent two-level system, the change of
the Cd sign means the ﬂip of the Z–component. This ﬂip means a population inversion of
the two-level system, i.e., if before level crossing (at t =
) the system is in the ground
state g, after the level crossing (at t = +
) it is in the excited state e. We can estimate

the amount of population left in the ground state, which is the nonadiabatic correction.

lines) for the amplitudes XcA(t) (plot a), YbA(t) (plot b).

Fig. 8. Comparison of the exact solution of the Landau-Zener model (dashed line) with
our approximate solution (solid line) for the ground state population of the reciprocal two-
level system after level crossing. The dependence of the exact solution of the Landau-Zener
model for the ground state population, [ρgg(η)]LZ, on the parameter η = V 2
0 /λ is shown by
the dashed line [see Eq. (116)]. The same dependence of our approximate solution, [ρgg(η)]A,

32

is shown by the solid line. Our solution is given by Eq. (115).

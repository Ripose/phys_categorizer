Nonradiating normal modes in a classical
many–body model of matter–radiation interaction

A. Carati∗ and L. Galgani†

February 2, 2008

ABSTRACT

We consider a classical model of matter–radiation interaction, in which
the matter is represented by a system of inﬁnitely many dipoles on a one–
dimensional lattice, and the system is dealt with in the so–called dipole (i.e.
linearized) approximation. We prove that there exist normal–mode solutions
of the complete system, so that in particular the dipoles, though performing
accelerated motions, do not radiate energy away. This comes about in virtue
of an exact compensation which we prove to occur, for each dipole, between
the “radiation reaction force” and a part of the retarded forces due to all
the other dipoles. This fact corresponds to a certain identity which we
name after Oseen, since it occurs that this researcher did actually propose
it, already in the year 1916. We ﬁnally make a connection with a paper of
Wheeler and Feynman on the foundations of electrodynamics. It turns out
indeed that the Oseen identity, which we prove here in a particular model,
is in fact a weak form of a general identity that such authors were assuming
as an independent postulate.

Introduction

In the framework of classical electrodynamics it is often given for granted
that a charged particle, when accelerated under the inﬂuence of some ex-
ternal force, gives oﬀ radiation and thus loses energy. Actually, if a single
particle is considered, this is only partially true. Indeed, if the contribution
of the radiative interaction to the equation of motion is taken into account
in the standard way through the familiar “radiation reaction force” propor-
tional to the time derivative of the acceleration (or through its relativitic
extension proposed by Dirac [1]), then a harmonic oscillator is easily proven
to steadily lose energy and fall onto the center of attraction, while in the
case of a Coulomb attraction the particle is found to start losing energy but
ﬁnally to escape to inﬁnity [2]. Anyway, in such two cases involving a single
charged particle it has been proven that oscillatory motions do not exist.

In the present paper we investigate the existence of oscillatory motions in
the case of N > 1 charged particles. In fact, we even consider a system of in-
ﬁnitely many particles, for an extremely simpliﬁed model particularly suited
for an analytical investigation. This is a system of equal particles (which we
also call “dipoles” or “ linear resonators”), that are all constrained to move
on a line and that, in the absence of any electrodynamical interaction, would
perform linear oscillations each about a proper site, the sites constituting a
periodic lattice on the given line. The electrodynamic interaction is intro-
duced in the standard way which was ﬁxed by Dirac for a general system of
particles and ﬁeld, taking however the so–called “dipole approximation” (i.e.
linearizing the equations of motion with respect to the displacements of the
resonators, and to their time derivatives). In such a way, by the standard
procedure of eliminating the ﬁeld in the coupled equations for matter and
ﬁeld, one is reduced to a system of equations which are just the mechanical
Newton equations for each dipole, in which the eﬀect of the electromagnetic
interaction appears through two contributions, namely: the familiar “radi-
ation reaction force” on each dipole (in the dipole approximation, which is
here equivalent to the nonrelativistic approximation), and a mutual retarded
force between each pair of dipoles. An interaction with an external free ﬁeld
could also have been considered. But we drop it, because it mainly plays
a role in connection with dispersion theory, with which we are not directly
concerned here. The equations of motion of the model are written down
below (see (1)). In fact, apart from the special choice of the disposition of
the equilibrium positions of the resonators, the present model is nothing but
the standard one that is usually employed for a microscopic molecular foun-
dation of optics. Actually, this is only partially true, because the necessity
of introducing the radiation reaction force in such models has been from
time to time put in doubt. Here, not only do we introduce such a radiation
reaction term into the model, relying on the authority of Dirac, but also
claim that its role is clariﬁed by the main result of the present paper.

2

Indeed we prove the rather surprising result that there exist solutions
of the complete system of equations, in which the retarded electromagnetic
forces produced on a given dipole by the ﬁelds “created” by all the other ones
add up in such a way as to exactly compensate the reaction radiation force
acting on it, so that one remains with no radiation at all. The relevant point
is that such nonradiating solutions, which have the form of normal modes
for the complete system, could not exist if the radiation reaction term had
not been included in the model. Presumably, the present result might prove
useful in establishing the existence of collective normal–mode motions also
in a quantum mechanical version of the present model of matter–radiation
interaction.

The way we conceived that nonradiating normal–mode solutions should
exist for models of matter–radiation interaction is the following one. We
were interested in the models of matter–radiation interaction that Planck
had actually been considering as mimicking a black body. We thus found
out that his models, although in principle involving N resonators, were actu-
ally dealing with a single resonator acted upon by an external ﬁeld: indeed
Planck explicitly made the assumption that the N resonators act “ inde-
pendently of one another”. At ﬁrst sight, such an assumption might appear
just an innocuous one, perhaps consituting an excessive simpliﬁcation of the
physical problem, but for the rest acceptable. Things changed however when
we suddenly realized [3] that such a simpliﬁed model is actually inconsistent.
Indeed, if the resonators are supposed to act incoherently, then, at a given
point, the far ﬁelds radiated by each of them are easily seen to add up to
give a divergent contribution (or a contribution proportional to the volume
in the case of ﬁnite N ), so that one meets here with a paradox analogous
to that of Olbers. Thus it seemed to us that the inconsistency could be re-
moved only if the system of resonators coupled by radiation were considered
in its globality, and special solutions were looked for, which present a coher-
ent character, i.e. are in the form of normal modes. Indeed, with suitable
coherent motions one might obtain that the multipoles of higher and higher
orders are made to vanish as N is increased, so that the total emitted ﬁeld
would vanish in the limit N → ∞ (see [4]). These two arguments agree in
indicating that a large number of particles should be considered if normal
modes have to be looked for. The choice of taking an inﬁnite number of
them was just made in order to obtain a simpliﬁcation in the mathematical
treatment of the problem, as occurs in so called “thermodynamic limit” of
statistical mechanics. This is the way we happened to ﬁnd out the existence
of normal modes. The core of the result is the identity mentioned above,
which gives an exact compensation (or cancellation) of the reaction radia-
tion term of each dipole, by a part of the sum of the retarded ﬁelds produced
by all the other dipoles.

Having found such a result, we started a bibliographical research with the
aim of learning whether something analogous was already known. Through

3

the book of Born and Wolf [5] we went back to the celebrated papers of Ewald
[6] and Oseen [7]. The best source of information proved however to be the
long review written by Jaﬀ`e [8] for the Handbuch der Experimentalphysik.
So we learned ﬁrst of all that the kind of model considered by us (dipoles
with mutual retarded electromagnetic interactions) was completely standard
(apart from discussions about the feasibility of the reaction radiation term)
in the many studies on the microscopic molecular foundation of optics, that
were ﬁlling up a consistent part of the issues of Annalen der Physik in
the years 1915–1925.
It should be mentioned however that essentially all
such papers (with the exception of that of Ewald, which on the other hand
apparently might present serious drawbacks) actually had a somehow mixed
character. Indeed, in estimating the total force acting on a single resonator
due to all the other ones, use was made of an approximation in which the
relevant sums were replaced by appropriate integrals, somehow in the spirit
of continuum mechanics. Thus the problem could not be dealt with in
a mathematically clearcut way, as occurs with a theorem for a system of
diﬀerential equations. From the review of Jaﬀ`e we also learned that our main
identity producing the mentioned cancellation had already been introduced
by Oseen [9] in a paper subsequent to the one mentioned by Born and
Wolf. The proof was given however in the spirit quoted above of continuum
mechanics, so that in particular it was not clear whether the identity applies
only to crystals or also to gases, or even whether it holds at all. Furthermore
it occured that Oseen was making use of his result in a critique [10] to a
previous theory of Planck on the dispersion of light. A long debate followed,
in which the two questions, truth of the identity and soundness of Planck’s
dispersion theory, were accomunated. The ﬁnal conclusion, explicitly stated
in the review of Jaﬀ`e (see page 266), was that the theory of Oseen was
actually wrong (irrig). As a consequence, it occurred that the identity
itself was apparently discarded by the scientiﬁc community, and eventually
forgotten. Because of all these considerations concerning the identity in
question which we like to call the Oseen identity (i.e. lack of an explicit proof
in a concrete model of diﬀerential equations, and its having been discarded
by the scientiﬁc community), we came to the conclusion that our proof,
produced as a theorem for a concrete model, might be worth of publication.
A further point of possible interest of our result is its strong relation
with the paper of Wheeler and Feynman [11] on the foundations of electro-
dynamics. Indeed it turns out that the Oseen identity, which is here proven
in our model, is nothing but a weak form of an identity that plays a central
role in the paper of Wheeler and Feynman, and is by them assumed as an
independent postulate.

In Section 2 the model is deﬁned. In Section 3 the Oseen identity and
the existence of normal modes are proven, while in Section 4 the form of the
dispersion relation is discussed. In Section 5 the Oseen identity is expressed
in terms of the forces acting on the dipoles, while the connection with the

4

paper of Wheeler and Feynman is discussed in Section 6. Some conclusive
comments follow in Section 7.

2 The model

We consider an inﬁnite number of charged particles of equal mass m and
charge e constrained on a line, and denote by xj, with j ∈ Z, their carte-
sian coordinates. We assume there exists an equilibrium conﬁguration with
positions xj = rj, where rj = ja and a is a positive parameter (the lattice
step), corresponding to a balance of the mutual Coulomb forces and of other
possible mechanical forces. In the absence of further electrodynamical inter-
actions, we assume that each particle performs a linear oscillation with the
same charactereristic angular frequency ω0 about its equilibrium position
rj. The interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is taken into account in
the dipole approximations as described below, to the eﬀect that the ﬁnal
mathematical model has as unknowns only the displacements qj = xj − rj of
the particles from their equilibrium positions, and that such displacements
satisfy the inﬁnite system of delayed diﬀerential equations (for j ∈ Z)

has been introduced. As mentioned in the Introduction, these equations,
apart from the special choice of the equilibrium positions of the particles,
are the ones that were commonly used for a molecular foundation of optics
in the years 1915–1925. Actually, this is completely true only for what
concerns the right hand sides of the equations, because a general agreement
had not yet been reached concerning the feasibility of the radiation reaction
term −mε¨˙qj appearing at the l.h.s. of each equation.

Equations (1) are obtained in a well known way, by eliminating the ﬁeld
in the coupled equations for matter and ﬁeld; we however recall it here brieﬂy
for the sake of completeness. Working in the dipole aproximation means to
linearize the system with respect to the displacements qj and to their time
derivatives. So the ﬁeld “created” by particle k is obtained from the Maxwell
equations by taking as sources the density and the current density given by

ρk(x) = eδ(x − rki) − eqki · ∇δ(x − rki)
jk(x) = e ˙qki δ(x − rki) .

(2)

5

respectively, δ being the usual “delta function”. The ﬁrst source term
eδ(x−rki) in the density gives rise to the static Coulomb ﬁeld, which was al-
ready taken into consideration. One then solves the Maxwell equations with
the other terms in the sources (2), and the retarded ﬁelds thus come out in
a natural way if the solutions are evaluated, as usual, at a time t > t0 where
t0 is an “initial time”; however, advanced ﬁelds too could have been used,
by matching the initial data through a suitable free ﬁeld. The analytical
computations leading to the retarded ﬁelds are classical, and are easily re-
produced. The results can however be found in reference [12] (see page 284).
The magnetic ﬁeld turns out to be already of ﬁrst order. So the magnetic
force is of second order, and drops out, and one remains with the electric
force. The electric ﬁeld naturally appears as decomposed into the sum of
several terms, but due to the speciﬁc model considered here (displacements
along a line, on which the dipoles themselves are lying), some terms cancel
and other ones suitably add up, so that one remains with two terms only,
which are the ones appearing at the r.h.s. of equation (1). In conformity to
the dipole approximation, they are evaluated at the equilibrium positions of
the particles.

We ﬁnally add a few words concerning the old problem of the “self–ﬁeld”,
i.e. the fact that the electric ﬁeld “created” by any particle j diverges at the
position of that particle itself, so that a suitable prescription is needed. Here
we follow the long tradition, going back to Lorentz, Planck and Abraham,
and deﬁnitely ﬁxed by Dirac (see also [13]), according to which the force
due the self-ﬁeld leads both to mass renormalization (so that the empirical
mass m is introduced as an external parameter) and to the familiar radiation
reaction force, which yelds, in the dipole approximation, the term −mε¨˙qj at
the l.h.s. of equations (1).

3 The Oseen identity and the normal modes

So, our model is deﬁned by the system of equations (1). For an analytical
discussion we have to make use of the the relation rjk = |rj − rk| = |j −
k| a holding in our speciﬁc one–dimensional model. With the spontaneous
relabeling k − j = n ∈ Z \ {0}, the ﬁnal form of the equations to be studied
here is thus (for j ∈ Z)

(3)

(cid:21)

The ﬁrst point we make concerning system (3) is that it cannot present
damped normal modes, contrary to what might be expected according to
the generic presumption that charged particles, when accelerated, should
radiate energy away. In fact, if one looks for normal modes, i.e. introduces

6

the ansatz (the real part should actually be taken later)

qj(t) = uj exp(iωt) ,

(4)

where the parameter ω is a priori a complex number, then (3) yelds the

(cid:18)

Xn6=0

(cid:19)
(5)
Now, if ω had a positive imaginary part (which gives the familiar damped
solution, when dealing with one single dipole subjected to an external forc-
ing), then the terms of the series at the r.h.s. would grow exponentially fast,
and the series would diverge. If instead ω had a negative imaginary part,
then one would be in presence of a so called runaway solution, i.e. a motion
qj = qj(t) diverging for t → +∞. Following Dirac, Planck and the other
classical authors, runaway solutions are discarded on physical grounds; and
the same we also do. In more explicit terms, as an essential part of the def-
inition of our model we restrict our consideration to motions qj = qj(t) that
are solutions to the equations (3) and in addition satisfy the nonrunaway
conditions of being bounded for all times.

So the problem of obtaining normal modes for our model is reduced to
ﬁnding solutions of the form (4) to system (5), with ω real. To this end we
introduce the further usual ansatz

uj = C exp(iκaj) ,

with a given parameter (the “wave number”) κ ∈ [−π/a, π/a). This corre-
sponds to considering a “material wave” with phase velocity v = ω/κ. So
one is reduced to a single complex equation, namely

− ω2 + ω2

0 + i εω3 =

2e2
ma3

f (κa, aω/c) + i g(κa, aω/c)
(cid:21)

(cid:20)

where we have introduced the two functions

This corresponds to two real equations, namely

in the two real variables ω and κ, with parameters a and ω0 (while e, c, m and
ε are thought of as ﬁxed). So there should be no possibility for the solutions
to deﬁne implicitly a curve in the (κ, ω) plane, typically a function ω = ω(κ),
as expected for a dispersion relation in an inﬁnite lattice. The situation
turns out however to be quite fortunate, because it can be established that
the second equation (11) actually is an identity (which we like to call the
Oseen identity), so that one remains with only one equation, i.e. (10), in
two variables.

This is established as follows. While the series f entering the real part
is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, it occurs that the series
g entering the imaginary part can be summed without pain. This amounts
to establishing the classical formulas

which are known to hold in the fundamental domain x ∈ [0, 2π); see for
example the handbook of Abramovitz and Stegun [14]. In such a way one
obtains

g(α, β) =

(

β3/3
β3/3 + π/2(α2 − β2)

if |β/α| < 1
if |β/α| ≥ 1 .

The ﬁrst of these is proved directly using the formulas (12), (13), while the
second one is established by translating the variable α + β or the variable
α − β, when required, to the fundamental domain [0, 2π).

Thus it turns out that, in the domain of the (κ,ω) plane where |v|/c < 1
(which corresponds to |β/α| < 1), everything combines in such a miracolous
way that equation (11) rather turns out to be an identity. In such a domain,
the dispersion relation is then deﬁned implicitly by the real transcendental
equation (10), which is discussed in the next Section. It is possible to check
that in the complementary domain |v|/c ≥ 1 there are no further solutions
to the complex equation (7). The waves having the property |v|/c < 1 are
known in optics as evanescent waves.

4 The dispersion relation

We come now to a discussion of the dispersion relation, namely the curve
in the (κ,ω) plane implicitly deﬁned by equation (10), depending on the
parameters a (the lattice step) and ω0 (the proper frequency of the dipoles).
The ﬁrst thing to be established is whether there are values of the parameters
for which a curve in fact exists at all; then one would like to determine some

8

qualitative features, such as for example whether the curve is the graph of a
function ω = ω(κ), and how it diﬀers from the constant function ω(κ) = ω0.
An analytical study is actually nonexpedient, because the function f
entering equation (10) turns out to be, at variance with g, non expressible
in terms of elementary functions. So we turn to a numerical study, taking
a pragmatic attitude. We have to look for possible intersections of the
0 with the surface z = (2e2/ma3) f (κa, ωa/c), by
parabolid z = −ω2 + ω2
approximating the function f through a suitable truncation of the series
(8).

The parameters a and ω0 could a priori be taken each in the whole
positive axis, but here we limit ourserlves to the consideration of some values
having an order of magnitude of interest for atomic physics. Actually, for
ω0 we just consider one value, i.e. the rotational frequency of the electron in
the hydrogen atom in circular motion at the Bohr radius RB; for a we take
several values ranging from 0.1 RB up to 5 RB. The results are illustrated
in Fig. 1, where the dispersion curve is reported for several values of a
(indicated in the Figure in units of RB).

The most signiﬁcant result seems to be that the dispersion curve indeed
exists; moreover its topology depends on the value of the lattice step a. All
curves have a common behavior at the right extreme of the Figure, because
they all intercept the vertical line κa = π with a horizontal tangent. The
situation is instead diﬀerent in the region of small κ. Indeed, there exists a
critical value a∗ ≃ 1.7 RB of a. For a > a∗ the curve is the graph of a function
ω = ω(κ) (in the whole admissible domain of κ) which, for increasing a, tends
to the horizontal curve ω = ω0; actually, the function essentially coincides
with the constant function ω(κ) = ω0 already for a ≃ 5 RB. Instead, for
a < a∗ the curve is the graph of a function κ = κ(ω), which has a central part
tending to to the vertical curve κa = π/2 as a decreases. Notice that in the
(κ, ω) plane the curves can exist only below the line ω/κ = c. Such a line is
reported in the Figure for the case a = 5 RB. Notice that the slope increases
as a diminishes, so that eventually the line becomes indistinguishable from
the axis of the ordinates; in the Figure, this would already occur fo a = RB.

5 The Oseen identity in terms of the forces

It has been shown in Section 3 how the Oseen identity (namely the identically
vanishing of the imaginary part of the complex equation (7) for the normal
modes) allows for the existence of a dispersion relation. We now investigate
how the identity reads in terms of the forces acting on each dipole. We show
the quite signiﬁcant result that such an identity provides a cancellation of the
radiation reaction term −mε¨˙qj pertaining to any dipole j by a resummation
of a part of the retarded forces due to all the other dipoles k 6= j. In the
next Section we will show that the identity can be expressed in another very

enlighting way, which will allow us to make a strong connection with the
work of Wheeler and Feynman.

Let us rewrite the equations of motion of our model in a perhaps more

transparent way as follows:

m(¨qj + ω2

0qj − ε¨˙qj) = e

Eret

jk .

(15)

Xk6=j

Here Eret
jk is the (component along the i vector of the) retarded electric ﬁeld
“created” by particle k and evaluated at the equilibrium position of particle
j, in the dipole approximation, namely:

jk = 2e

r3

+

1

˙qk(t − rjk/c)
r2

.

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

(16)

Now, looking back at the way in which the existence of normal modes was
proved, it is obvious that the result found in Section 3 can equivalently be
expressed in the following way: There exist normal–mode solutions qj(t) =
A cos(κaj − ωt) of system (15) (16) such that the sum of the retarded forces
acting on any dipole j due to all other dipoles k 6= j decomposes as

e

Eret

jk =

Xk6=j

2e2
a3 f (κa, aω/c) qj (t) − m ε¨˙qj(t) ,

(17)

i.e. into a term that exactly compensates the “radiative term” at the l.h.s.
of (15), and into another one that corrects the mechanical frequency ω0 as

10

to have ¨qj + ω2qj = 0 (as obviously should be, by the deﬁnition itself of a
normal–mode solution).

One could now ask whether it is possbile to describe in some more
trasparent way such a splitting of the sum of the retarded forces acting
on dipole j into a part compensating the radiative term, and another one
correcting the mechanical frequency ω0. This is actually the door through
which the advanced forces naturally enter the arena, and one is somehow
compelled to take them into consideration, notwithstanding the fact that,
following the traditional approach, only retarded forces had originally been
introduced in the model.

Indeed, the above decomposition of the total retarded force acting on
dipole j into a term proportional to qj and another one proportional to ¨˙qj
turns out to actually constitute a decomposition into a symmetrical part
and an antisymetrical one with respect to time reversal. On the other hand
the most natural decomposition of such a type for the single retarded forces
themselves is nothing but

(21)

Due to the linearity of the equations of motion, this result can be ex-
tended to any combination of linear modes, and so one is lead to the main
result of the present Section, namely: In a generic solution of system (15)
(16), the “reaction radiation force” acting on each dipole is exactly compen-
sated by the sum of the semidiﬀerences of the retarded and the advanced
forces due to all the other dipoles, i.e. the relation (21) holds.

11

So we have the following situation.

In the original deﬁnition of our
model, the force acting on particle j had been deﬁned, in the familiar way, as
the Lorentz force (in the dipole approximation) due to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. By the standard procedure of eliminating the ﬁeld in the coupled
equations of matter and ﬁeld, such a force was then represented as the sum
of the retarded forces due to all other particles k 6= j. On the other hand,
such a resultant retarded force can be looked upon as being split into the
combination (18) of the semisum and the semidiﬀerence of the retarded and
the advanced forces due to all the other particles. But the Oseen identity in
the form (21) then shows that the semidiﬀerences just add up in such a way
as to exactly cancel the reaction radiation term pertaining to particle j.

This has the important consequence that in the original system deﬁning
the model the radiation reaction term appearing in each equation can be
dropped, provided that the r.h.s. be changed in a corresponding way, namely
with each retarded force replaced by the corresponding semisum of retarded
and advanced forces. So the original system of equation (15) can equivalently
be rewritten in the form

m (¨qj + ω2

0qj) = e

6 The Oseen identity as a weak form of the Wheeler–

Feynman identity

We now rewrite the Oseen identity (21) in a more perspicuous form. To this
end we have to introduce the quantity [Eret
]/2. Apparently, this
is not deﬁned, inasmuch as it involves two diverging terms. However, one
immediately sees that such singularities are removable, that the quantity is
correctly deﬁned, and in fact one has

jj − Eadv
jj

Eret

= mε¨˙qj .

jj − Eadv

Indeed the actual original quantities of interest are the ﬁelds Eret
(k)(x) and
Eadv
(k) (x) “created” by particle k and evaluated at the current point x, be-
cause the quantities entering the model are nothing but such ﬁelds evaluated
jk = Eret
at the equilibrium position rj of particle j, i.e. Eret
(k)(rj), and the cor-
responding advanced quantity. Now, evidently Eret
(j)(x) diverges as x → rj,
but from the explicit expression one immediately checks that the limit exists
for the semidiﬀerence, and that its value is given according to (23). This in
fact just is a particular case of a general result found by Dirac.

(23)

The conclusion is that, in virtue of (23), the Oseen identity (21) now

reads

= 0 ,

j ∈ Z .

We now come to the connection with the work of Wheeler and Feynman
[11]. The authors point out that there exist two a priori diﬀerent formula-
tions of electrodynamics of point particles, namely what they call “the theory
of Schwarzschild and Fokker ” on the one hand, and the “ theory of Dirac”
on the other. The latter, which is the traditional one, includes the radiation
reaction term −mε¨˙qj and introduces retarded forces; the ﬁrst one drops the
radiation reaction term and introduces the semisum of the retarded and the
advanced forces. In our model, such theories amount to nothing but equa-
tions (22) and (15) respectively. The declared aim of Wheeler and Feynman
(see page 170 of their paper) was to prove “a complete equivalence between
the theory of Schwarzschild and Fokker on the one hand and the usual for-
malism of electrodynamics (i.e. that of Dirac) on the other ”.

They are able to prove the equivalence by making use of an hypothesis,
which they describe in physical terms as corresponding to the existence
of an “absorbing universe”. In mathematical terms such an hypothesis is
formulated as requiring the identically vanishing of the semidiﬀerence of the
ﬁelds created by all the particles, i.e. the identity

Eret

(k)(x) − Eadv

(k) (x)

Xk∈Z

= 0 ,

x ∈ R3 .

(25)

In fact, for the equivalence it is suﬃcient to assume that the above relation
holds just at the positions of all the particles and not in the full space R3.
Now, in our model we have shown that the identity in the latter weaker form
is not an additional hypothesis, but rather a theorem. Thus the equivalence
of the two formulations of electrodynamics of point particles according to
Schwarzschild–Fokker and to Dirac is proven in our model.

We ﬁnally add a comment, concerning the way in which Wheeler and
Feynman discuss the equivalence of the two formulations. They give four
arguments, with headings “The radiative reaction: derivation I,II,III,IV ”.
The fourth “derivation” is essentially the one given here in Section 5 (apart
from the fact that they take as a postulate the identity which we prove).
On the other hand, in the previous “derivations” they attempt essentially
at proving (instead of postulating) what we called the Oseen identity in
its ﬁrst form (21). So, it will not appear strange that we happened to
understand the whole paper of Wheeler and Feynamn, and in particular
their “derivations”, only after we proved ourselves the Oseen identity in
our model. The conclusion is thus that we prove in a special model what
they argument on general grounds. Conversely, this seems to be a strong
indication that the Oseen identity might be proved, as a real theorem, for a
much larger class of models.

7 Conclusions

So we have proven, at least for our particular linearized model of many–body
matter radiation interaction, that there exist nonradiating normal modes,
i.e. solutions to the equations of motion of the complete system particles
plus ﬁeld in which the mechanical energy of the particles remains constant,
notwithstanding the fact that all particles perform accelerated motions. A
preliminary analytical investigation shows that the same phenomenon occurs
in a diﬀerent model, in which, at variance with the present one, also the far
ﬁelds decaying as 1/r play a role. A natural guess seems to be that the
same should occur with a three dimensional crystal. What should occur
for a disordered system or a gas, is instead, apparently, completely open.
Another open question concerns the Wheeler–Feynman identity (25). Indeed
the Oseen identity was shown here to be equivalent to a weak form of it, and
thus naturally the question arises whether the Wheeler–Feynman identity
itself, in its general form (25), holds.

We add now a further comment, concerning the connection of the present
work with the problem of a microscopic foundation of optics, especially for
the theories of dispersion and of extinction of light. At ﬁrst sight one might
be tempted to believe that the handbook of Born and Wolf did already say
the last word, at least for what concerns the general aspects of the problem.
But an accurate analysis shows that actually this is not the case. Indeed
they do not deal with a clearly deﬁned mathematical model, and somehow
oscillate between a continuum phenomenological description of matter on the
one hand, and the consideration of single dipoles on the other; moreover,
they do not even introduce an actual dynamical equation for the dipoles.
According to Born and Wolf, the dynamical foundation was given by Ewald
[6] and by Oseen (in his ﬁrst paper [7]). Now, in our opinion no one of these
two works is consistent.
Indeed they both neglect the radiation reaction
term, and nevertheless pretend that normal modes do exist. But we have
shown that, at least for a one–dimensional crystal, a part of the retarded
forces acting on any given dipole due to all the other ones, just add up
in such a way as to produce the “dissipative” term −mε¨˙qj, which would
exactly compensate the reaction radiation term, if this had originally been
included in the model. This is indeed the reason for the very existence of
normal modes in our model. But conversely, just for the same reason, normal
modes cannot exist if the reaction radiation term had not been included in
the model. In our opinion, there should be some mistake hidden in the two
quoted works. It seems to us that the new relevant step after such works is
just the one performed by Oseen in his subsequent paper [9], where the idea
of the cancellation was introduced. Now, it happened that this second work
of Oseen was ﬁnally discarded as wrong, and his proposal forgotten. On
the other hand, the cancellation is proven here as a theorem in a concrete
model. In our opinion, the status of the microscopic foundation of optics,

14

which should lead to an explanation of the dispersion and the extinction of
light in molecular terms, should perhaps be reconsidered.

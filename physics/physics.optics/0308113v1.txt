Light-induced rotation of absorbing microscopic particles by transfer of angular momentum from
light to the material raises the possibility of optically driven micromachines. The phenomenon has
been observed using elliptically polarized laser beams [1] or beams with helical phase structure [2, 3].
But it is diﬃcult to develop high power in such experiments because of overheating and unwanted
axial forces, limiting the achievable rotation rates to a few hertz. This problem can in principle
be overcome by using transparent particles, transferring angular momentum by a mechanism ﬁrst
observed by Beth in 1936 [4], when he reported a tiny torque developed in a quartz waveplate
due to the change in polarization of transmitted light. Here we show that an optical torque can be
induced on microscopic birefringent particles of calcite held by optical tweezers [5]. Depending on the
polarization of the incident beam, the particles either become aligned with the plane of polarization
(and thus can be rotated through speciﬁed angles) or spin with constant rotation frequency. Because
these microscopic particles are transparent, they can be held in three-dimensional optical traps at
very high power without heating. We have observed rotation rates in excess of 350 Hz.

A typical optical tweezers arrangement was used to
trap microscopic calcite particles in three dimensions us-
ing between 30 and 300 mW of laser light at a wavelength
of 1064 nm. The optical trap used a 100× oil-immersion,
high numerical aperture (NA = 1.3) microscope objec-
tive. The trapping beam was initially linearly polarized,
and the plane of polarization could be rotated using a
half-wave plate. Alternatively, a quarter-wave plate al-
lowed the ellipticity of polarization to be varied. The
particles were fragments obtained by crushing a small
calcite crystal, giving irregular particles 1–15 µm across.
They were dispersed in distilled water in a trapping cell
consisting of a well in a microscope slide with a coverslip.
Because of their birefringent nature, calcite particles
can act as wave-plates; a calcite particle 3 µm thick is
a λ/2 plate for 1064 nm light. On passage through a
fragment of calcite, the ordinary and extraordinary com-
ponents of the incident light will undergo diﬀerent phase
shifts. If this results in a change in the angular momen-
tum carried by the light, there will be a corresponding
torque on the material. Our results can be understood
using a simple plane wave picture; the interaction be-
tween an incident plane wave and a waveplate is outlined
below. We note that the calcite waveplate is trapped at
the focal point of the beam, where the wavefronts are
nearly plane.

An incident laser beam can, in general, have both cir-

cularly polarized and plane polarized components; that
is, it will be elliptically polarized. Elliptically polarized
light can be described by

E = E0 exp(−iωt) cos φˆx + iE0 exp(−iωt) sin φˆy

where φ describes the degree of ellipticity of the light
(φ = 0 or π/2) indicates plane-polarized light, φ = π/4
circularly polarized light). The angular momentum of a
plane electromagnetic wave (the incident light) of angular
frequency ω can be found from the electric ﬁeld E and
its complex conjugate E⋆ by integrating over all spatial
elements d3r giving

where ǫ is the permittivity.

To calculate the change in angular momentum of the
light after passage through a birefringent material, the
incident elliptically polarized light is ﬁrst expressed in
terms of components parallel and perpendicular to the
optic axis of the material by

E = E0 exp(−iωt)(cos φ cos θ − i sin φ sin θ)ˆi

+E0 exp(−iωt)(cos φ sin θ + i sin φ cos θ)ˆj

(1)

where θ is the angle between the fast axis of the quarter-
wave plate producing the elliptically polarized light and
the optic axis of the birefringent material. The phase
shift due to passing through a thickness d with refractive

index n is kdn, where k is the free-space wavenumber, so
the emergent light ﬁeld will be

E = E0 exp(−iωt) exp(ikdne)
(cos φ cos θ − i sin φ sin θ)ˆi
+E0 exp(−iωt) exp(ikdno)
(cos φ sin θ + i sin φ cos θ)ˆj

where ne and no are the extraordinary and ordinary re-
fractive indices of the birefringent material.

The changes in the angular momentum of the light
cause a reaction torque per unit area on the thickness d
of material of

In general, the ﬁrst term of equation (3) is the torque
due to the plane-polarized component of elliptically po-
larized light while the second term is due to the change
in polarization caused by passage through the medium.
For plane-polarized light, φ = 0 or π/2, so the torque on
the particle is proportional to sin 2θ, so that a particle
will experience torque so long as θ is non-zero, and will
be at a stable equilibrium when the fast axis of the crys-
tal is aligned with the plane of polarization (θ = 0). We
found that calcite fragments trapped in plane-polarized
light are aligned in a particular orientation, and a par-
ticular particle is always aligned in the same plane each
time it is trapped. When the plane of polarization is
rotated using a half-wave plate, a particle’s alignment
exactly follows the rotation of the plane of polarization.
In ﬁgure 1, a calcite fragment is shown to rotate through
80° as a half-wave plate controlling the polarization of
the trapping beam is rotated through 40°, illustrating
the alignment of birefringent particles to the plane of po-
larization. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of an
optically trapped particle being rotated through a preset

FIG. 1: Three sequential photographs (frames) of a trapped
calcite crystal, showing alignment with the plane of polar-
ization of the trapping beam. A λ/2 waveplate was rotated
by 20°between successive photographs, rotating the plane of
polarization by 40°, as shown by the arrows, and exerting
an alignment torque on the crystal, causing it to rotate to a
new position. This can be used to rotate the particle at a
controlled speed, or to control its orientation.

FIG. 2: Nine frames of a trapped calcite crystal, showing
free rotation due to an elliptically polarized trapping beam.
The speed of rotation is limited by the viscous drag on the
particle. As the optical torque acting on the particle depends
on its orientation, the rotation speed is not constant. The
frames are 40 ms apart. Scale bar is 10 µm.

angle; a modiﬁcation to the setup whereby the half-wave
plate could be spun at a set rate would also allow the
particle to rotate at a preset frequency.

The second term of equation (3) will be constant for a
given laser power and ellipticity of polarization (charac-
terized by φ), and will be maximum for circularly polar-
ized light when the ﬁrst term vanishes. Hence, when
trapped in a circularly polarized beam, a birefringent
particle will experience constant torque.
In a viscous
medium, this torque will be balanced by the drag torque,
tD = DΩ, where D is the drag coeﬃcient and Ω is the
angular speed, so in this case a birefringent particle will
rotate with constant frequency and angular speed. We
measured the rotation frequencies of trapped calcite frag-
ments by detection of back-scattered light [1]; the results
show that calcite fragments rotate at constant frequency
in circularly polarized light, and that this frequency is
proportional to the laser power. A rotating particle is
shown in ﬁgure 2. The fastest rotation frequency mea-
sured was 357 Hz, for a particle 1 µm thick trapped in a
300 mW laser beam.

For the general case of elliptically polarized light, both
the alignment torque and the spinning torque will act,
and the eﬀect on the birefringent particle will depend
on the thickness d and the ellipticity φ of the light. The
particle will only rotate if the maximum alignment torque
is less than the spinning torque. This is shown in ﬁgure
In ﬁgure 4 we plot the variation of rotation rate of

FIG. 3: The degree of circular polarization required to cause
spinning of a trapped particle depends on its thickness. Here
we compare measurements of the minimum angle required for
rotation with the theoretical solution. Only if the particle is
the exact thickness of a half-wave plate will it always spin
in elliptical light. For all other particle thicknesses, there is
some angle θ for which the maximum alignment torque will
be greater than the spinning torque. The degree of ellip-
ticity of polarization (measured by φ) required for the on-
set of rotation is found from the case where the alignment
torque is maximum and the total torque is zero, which is
when sin[kd(no − ne)] cos 2φ = {1 − cos[kd(no − ne)]} sin 2φ.
The solution to this is φrotate = [π − kd(no − ne)]/4. In gen-
eral a particle will be aligned to the plane of polarization of
the trapping beam unless there is suﬃcient torque due to the
circularly polarized component to set it into rotation, when
it will experience a position-dependent torque.

trapping beam φ, showing the characteristic behaviour
of a birefringent particle in elliptically polarized light.

The agreement between our results and the theory out-
lined above shows that the calcite particles act as mi-
croscopic wave-plates. The measurement of the rotation
speed of spinning particles is a less accurate but simpler
analogue of Beth’s experiment [4]. In particular, assum-
ing conventional viscous drag, the observed speeds are
consistent with the accepted intrinsic spin angular mo-
mentum of ¯h per photon (see ﬁgure 4). Our results also
show how optical torques can be exerted on certain mi-
croscopic objects with high precision and eﬃciency, with
minimal heating. Depending on the details of the ar-
rangement, either a constant torque independent of ori-
entation can be exerted, leading to rotation rates up to
hundreds of hertz, or alternatively, the orientation of the
object can be smoothly controlled.

The controllability of the motion of calcite particles
and the minimal absorption involved suggests calcite as

FIG. 4: The variation of rotation frequency with the polariza-
tion of the trapping beam. The sudden onset of rotation when
the minimum angle is reached can be clearly seen. The the-
oretical response of the particle allows a particle of unknown
size to be measured, or can be used to determine the viscos-
ity of a ﬂuid. In this case, the trapping beam has a power
of 50 mW, and the particle is 6.15 µm in radius and 2.3 µm
thick. The frequency of rotation for a trapping beam of power
P and optical frequency ω is f = [Re(P {[1 − cos kd(no −
ne)]2 sin2 2φ − sin2 kd(no − ne) cos2 2φ}1/2)]/(2πωD). The
drag torque coeﬃcient D can be estimated by representing the
particle as an ellipsoid [6]. The drag will lie between that of a
sphere of radius a in a medium of viscosity µ (D = 8πµa3) and
a disk of the same radius (D = (32/3)µa3). Under the very
low Reynolds number ﬂow conditions encountered here, the
surface texture and ﬁne structure of the particle are unimpor-
tant. The maximum rotation speed, f = P/πωD, will result
when the incident light is circularly polarized and the parti-
cle is a half-wave plate. Small particles will generally rotate
faster due to less drag, but as particles become too small,
their thickness becomes much less than the ideal half-wave
case, and they will not intercept all of the power available to
spin larger particles.

rers, or optically powered cogwheels. The rotation could
also be used to study the viscosity of small samples of
ﬂuids, or the alignment of calcite particles could be used
to hold probe particles in particular orientations, which
could be useful for atomic-force or other forms of mi-
croscopy. The birefringence of biological samples is usu-
ally much less than that of calcite, but may sometimes
be large enough to allow the same alignment and free
rotation to be achieved.

We analyze theoretically the eﬀect of technical ﬂuctuations on laser lineshape in terms of statistics
of amplitude and phase noise and their respective bandwidths. While the phase noise tends to
broaden the linewidth as the magnitude of the noise increases, the amplitude noise brings out an
additional structure with its spectral density reﬂecting the magnitude of the noise. The eﬀect of
possible coupling between those two noises is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Fourier transform of the ﬁrst-order correlation function

Lineshape is one of the fundamental properties which
tells about how monochromatic a laser is. It also provides
a way to investigate the light emission mechanisms for
various types of lasers [1]. However the technical ﬂuctua-
tions inherent in a laser and its environment prevent one
from observing spectral structure determined by intrinsic
dynamics only. In fact, the intrinsic limit of linewidth set
by quantum noise [2] is much smaller than we usually ob-
serve in laboratory. The sources of such noise is usually
thermal or mechanical and they appear as, for example,
cavity drift, ﬂuctuation of population inversion and insta-
bility pump ﬁeld. We may classify the aspects of those
ﬂuctuations into phase and amplitude noise with vari-
ous bandwidth. We analyze the eﬀect of technical ﬂuc-
tuations on lineshape in terms of amplitude and phase
in case of sinusoidal modulation and Gaussian distribu-
tion. Their respective bandwidth and possible coupling
between those two [3] are also included.

where E0(t) is a slowly varying envelope and φ(t) is a
randomly ﬂuctuating phase.

Firstly consider the case in which the amplitude E0(t)
is constant E0 and φ(t) undergoes a random walk process
which imposes Gaussian statistics on φ(t). The eﬀective
frequency is

ωef f (t) = ω0 + ˙φ(t)

(2)

which represents that the time derivative of φ(t) makes
jitter around the carrier frequency. According to Wiener-
Khinchin theorem, the spectral lineshape is given by

The graph of J0(2φ0 cos2 Ωτ /2) is given in Fig. 2(a)
and (c) for diﬀerent value of magnitude of modulation
It is inﬁnite pulse train with the repetition rate
∆F .
(Ω/2π)−1.
Its Fourier transform constitutes frequency
comb whose width of envelope is determined by the in-
verse time duration of the pulse, T . (Fig.1 (b),(d)) T
gets shorter as we increase ∆F because the argument of
Bessel function changes by larger amount for the same
change of τ . This is reasonable result since the more
harsh we swing the carrier frequency, the wider the spec-
trum should be. Ω determines the repetition rate, i.e.
density (degree of ﬁne-tooth) of the comb.

If another frequency components other than Ω is added
in Eq. (12), the ﬁne spectral structure is easily destroyed
by the complexity of argument in Bessel function in Eq.
(17). The additional modulation is linearly added to
x and ﬁnally to the argument of the Bessel function.
This complicated argument brings about reduction of the
pulse height of J0 by only a small number of such super-
position. Thus, in the spectrum, the spectral density of
each tooth in the comb gets smaller and interval between
adjacent teeth gets narrower.

(11)

and its Fourier transform gives a Lorentzian line shape
with FWHM of (∆R)2.

If the spectrum of ˙φ(t) has a ﬁnite bandwidth, σ2
x de-
pends on the correlation time tc of ˙φ(t). We can model it
by a square-shaped temporal correlation as in Fig. 1(a).
In terms of frequency this noise is the white noise ﬁltered

by a sinc-function low-pass ﬁlter of width

Thus g(1)(τ ) is Gaussian up to τ = √2tc and thereafter
exponentially decaying function. Of course it is continu-
ous at τ = √2tc having the common value e−(2∆R)2t2
c . If
tc is longer than (∆R)−1, g(1)(τ ) is practically Gaussian.
We have Gaussian lineshape with its linewidth
∆R in
that case. In the opposite limit where tc goes to zero, the
Lorentzian lineshape due to the white noise is recovered.
Another possible case of frequency jittering is slow
modulation of carrier frequency as it usually happens in a
laser with its cavity slowly drifting around the resonance
frequency. PDF of Eq. (9) is no more valid in such cases.
Rather we start from

FIG. 3: (a) Sidebands due to the amplitude modulation. (b)
If the modulation has a ﬁnite band, the resultant spectrum
has low-lying wings corresponding to the noise band. In this
ﬁgure, Gaussian noise is presented.

Consider the intensity modulated like

where 1
1. This
implies that the spectrum is given with sidebands, which
are symmetrically apart from the carrier frequency by
integer multiples of Ω. (Fig. 3(a)) Extending this idea to
the noise with ﬁnite band we can imagine superposition
of many sidebands comprised of all frequency component
within the band. The resultant spectrum contains the
low-lying wing structure near the carrier frequency. One
example where the Gaussian noise is applied is depicted
in Fig. 3 (b). Note that the Lorentzian is smoothed out
by Gaussian proﬁle which brings about the considerable
deviation from a Lorentzian lineshape.

INTENSITY NOISE

Next let us include the eﬀect of the amplitude ﬂuctua-
tion. The criterion between amplitude and phase, in this
analysis, rests with their direct appearance in intensity.

4

The same result can be understood in a diﬀerent way.
The spectral amplitude
(ω) is the Fourier transform of
the product of two functions: E0(t) and ei[ωt+φ(t)]. Thus
the overall spectrum is given by convolution of each spec-
trum of the functions. If the bandwidth of the amplitude
noise is Gaussian,

E

deﬁnitely reveal the eﬀect of amplitude ﬂuctuation.

There might be possible coupling between amplitude
and phase as is well known in semiconductor lasers. If
φ(t) is aﬀected by the intensity modulation as a quadra-
ture φ(t) = 2δ sin Ωt where δ designates the magnitude
of coupling,

where ∆L and ∆G are spectral widths of the Lorentzian
and Gaussian respectively and aG is relative spectral am-
plitude of Gaussian noise.

If the bandwidth of amplitude ﬂuctuation is too broad,
the low-lying structure may not be easily recognized. The
manifestation of amplitude noise can then be conﬁrmed
in the experiment from the intensity correlation function
g(2)(τ ) since

We investigated the eﬀect of technical ﬂuctuations on
laser lineshape. The Gaussian noise in frequency make
the lineshape a Lorentzian or a Gaussian depending on
the correlation time of the noise. Slow swing of frequency
results in a lineshape with many sidebands by the period-
icity involved. The amplitude noise imposes the low-lying
wing structure in the spectrum. The bandwidth of the
noise only determines the width of the additional struc-
ture while the coupling between the amplitude and phase
might lead to an asymmetry in the structure.

This letter describes the design and operation of a single mode polymer-based nano-ﬂuidic dye
laser. The device relies on light-conﬁnement in a nano-structured polymer ﬁlm where an array of
nano-ﬂuidic channels is ﬁlled by capillary action with a liquid dye solution which has a refractive
index lower than that of the polymer.
In combination with a third order distributed feed-back
(DFB) grating, formed by the array of nano-ﬂuidic channels, this yields a low threshold for lasing.
The laser is straight-forward to integrate on Lab-on-a-Chip micro-systems, e.g.
for novel sensor
concepts, where coherent, tunable light in the visible range is desired.

the sub-wavelength regime is entered [12].

In this Letter, we present the design and operation
of a single mode polymer-based nano-ﬂuidic dye laser.
The device is fabricated by a fast and ﬂexible lithog-
raphy technique, combining electron beam lithography
(EBL) and UV lithography (UVL) in a single polymer
ﬁlm, enabling fast prototyping of device designs. In the
device, see Fig. 1, a third order DFB resonator is formed
by inﬁltrating a periodic array of nano-ﬂuidic channels

Integration of optical and ﬂuidic functionalities on a
chip has recently been investigated by several research
groups to realize novel opto-ﬂuidic laser devices, micro-
ﬂuidic dye lasers, suitable for Lab-on-a-Chip micro-
systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These optically pumped de-
vices consist of micro-ﬂuidic channels with an embedded
optical resonator and a liquid laser dye is used as active
gain medium. In general, these devices can be added to a
micro-ﬂuidic chip without adding additional fabrication
steps [8], thus oﬀering a simple way of integrating opti-
cal transducers to Lab-on-a-Chip micro-systems [9], and
pave the way for novel integrated sensor concepts [10].

The threshold for lasing is a key parameter for the
feasibility of these devices in a future technology. Dis-
tributed feed-back (DFB) laser resonators have proven
particular suited in this respect. A DFB micro-ﬂuidic
dye laser was ﬁrst demonstrated by Balslev and Kris-
tensen [3], who used a high order Bragg grating in an
8 µm thick polymer ﬁlm to obtain feed-back. Single
mode lasing with a threshold ﬂuence of approximately
20 µJ/mm2 was obtained due to mode selective losses in
the multi-mode structure where light was not guided in
the ﬂuidic segments. Vezenov et al. [6] obtained liquid-
core guiding using a low refractive index polymer and a
high refractive index liquid. Li et al. [7] exploited this
concept to realize a 15th order DFB laser with a record-
low threshold ﬂuence for lasing of 8 µJ/mm2.

However, the 15th order Bragg grating still gives rise
to scattering of light out of the chip plane [11]. These
losses can be reduced by employing a lower order Bragg

with planar waveguiding in the polymer ﬁlm could be
used. The requirement of a high refractive index liquid
and low refractive index polymer [6, 7] may be relaxed
by reducing the dimensions of the resonator segments as

with a liquid laser dye. The ﬁlling is mediated by capil-
lary action, thus simplifying the operation of the device
as opposed to conventional setups with external syringe
pumps. Replenishing of the dye in the cavity region is
achieved for hours through capillary ﬁlling of a 16 cm
long meandering channel following the cavity region. By
employing a third order Bragg grating, we demonstrate
single mode lasing with a threshold ﬂuence comparable
to the results of [7]. The sub-wavelength dimensions of
the third order DFB grating yield a low coupling loss
for the light when traversing the dye ﬁlled nano-ﬂuidic
channels, and combined with the feed-back of the DFB
grating, this yields an eﬃcient laser device.

The laser is based on a planar waveguide structure
supporting a single propagating TE-TM mode. The
basic waveguide structure consists of a SiO2 (refrac-
tive index n = 1.46) buﬀer substrate, a 300 nm thick
core layer of the negative-tone resist SU-8 (n = 1.59)
and a top cladding of poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA)
(n = 1.49). The device structure is formed by nano-
ﬂuidic channels deﬁned lithographically in the SU-8 ﬁlm.
The laser resonator consists of an array of 300 nm high
nano-channels of period Λ = 601 nm which comprises a
third order Bragg grating with a central π/2 phase-shift,
embedded in a 500 µm wide shallow nano-channel.

To fabricate the devices, a 430 nm thick ﬁlm of SU-8
2000 resist [13] is spin-coated onto a Si substrate with a
2.5 µm thick thermally grown oxide layer. The wafer is
baked at 90◦C for 1 min. The device structure is deﬁned
by combined EBL and UVL in the SU-8 ﬁlm. The nano-
structures of the third order DFB grating are deﬁned
by 100 kV electron beam exposure (JEOL-JBX9300FS,
dose 3 µC/cm2). The total writing time for all 32 de-
vices on a 4” wafer is 15 min. After electron beam
exposure, the micron-sized structures (meander channel
and reservoirs) are deﬁned in the same polymer ﬁlm by
UV exposure (20 s at 8.9 mW/cm2), the wafer is post-
exposure baked at 90◦C for 1 min., and the micro and
nano-structures are developed simultaneously in propy-
lene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 30
s, followed by an iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) rinse. The
wafer is subsequently subjected to a 20 s soft oxygen
plasma [14] to remove any residues of SU-8 at the SiO2
surface in the nano-channels of the DFB resonator. Af-
ter the plasma treatment, the structures are 300 nm
high, and the heights of the EBL and UVL deﬁned struc-
tures are matched within 30 nm. Fluidic access holes are
formed by micro powder blasting [15] and the channels
are sealed by a glass lid, using adhesive bonding by means
of a 5 µm PMMA ﬁlm (2200 N, 140◦C, 10 min.) [16].

The laser is characterized by adding a droplet of dye
solution to the ﬂuid inlet, thus ﬁlling the DFB resonator
structure by capillary action. In this Letter, the laser dye
Rhodamine 6G (R6G) is dissolved in ethylene glycol (n =
1.43), ethanol (n = 1.33), and in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene
glycol and benzyl alcohol (n = 1.485 by experimentally
conﬁrmed linear extrapolation of the refractive indices),
all with a concentration of 2×10−2 mol/L and a refractive

2

index below that of the polymer surrounding the channel.
The laser is optically pumped through the glass lid by a
frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm (5 ns pulse
duration, 10 Hz repetition rate).

Fig. 2 shows laser spectra from four diﬀerent chips
ﬁlled with R6G in ethylene glycol. The results demon-
strate wafer-scale spectral reproducibility of the laser,
lasing in a single mode. The emission is polarized per-
pendicularly to the chip plane (TM). The average laser
wavelength is 582.72 nm with a standard deviation of
0.14 nm, at the resolution limit of our spectrometer (0.15
nm). The deviation and the minor peaks in Fig. 2(c),(d)
may arise from grating imperfections due to fabrication
defects. The spectral shape and linewidth of the laser is
not resolved by the spectrometer and remains undeter-
mined.

Fig. 3 shows laser spectra from chips with R6G dis-
solved in diﬀerent solvents, thus demonstrating tunabil-
ity of the laser from 581.41 nm to 587.86 nm. A quanti-
tative theoretical prediction of the shift in wavelength
requires a full solution of Maxwell’s equations in the
fabricated structure, since the structures are of sub-
wavelength dimensions [12]. In Fig. 3(c), the minor side-
mode shifted 1.8 nm from the main peak may be at-
tributed to an additional phase-shift introduced in the
DFB grating by a stitching error during electron beam
exposure. The dye laser output power is found by in-
tegrating the measured laser spectrum for each value
of the average pump pulse ﬂuence. The dye laser out-
put power vs. average pump pulse ﬂuence follows the
standard pump/output relation of two linear segments
around a lasing threshold ﬂuence Qth.

The coupling loss γ for a period of the DFB grating
has been modelled by a ﬁnite-diﬀerence beam propaga-
tion method [17, 18]. Light of the observed wavelength

travelling in the TM mode of the single mode polymer
waveguide is propagated through a 273 nm wide channel
ﬁlled with a liquid of refractive index nch, correspond-
ing to the value of the used solvent. The calculations
yield the energy propagation loss corresponding to the
coupling loss for a period of the DFB grating. The loss
decreases for increasing nch, see Table I. To obtain las-
ing in the resonator, the ampliﬁcation of the R6G must
equal the loss. As expected, the experiments show that
the threshold ﬂuence for lasing decreases as the refractive
index of the R6G solution increases, see Table I. Further,
when considering the absorbed pump energy throughout
the device, the eﬀective threshold ﬂuence may be consid-

3

erably lower.

In summary, we have demonstrated a single mode
nano-ﬂuidic dye laser with a low threshold for lasing com-
parable to the results of [7], but operating with liquids
of refractive index below the refractive index of the sur-
rounding polymer. The device relies on light-conﬁnement
in a nano-structured polymer ﬁlm where the individual
resonator elements – nano-ﬂuidic channels and polymer
walls – are of sub-wavelength dimensions. The resonator
consists of an array of nano-ﬂuidic channels forming a
third order DFB Bragg grating resonator. The laser is
realized using a fast and ﬂexible fabrication technique,
combining electron beam lithography and UV lithogra-
phy in a single polymer ﬁlm, followed by adhesive poly-
mer wafer bonding. The laser is straight-forward to in-
for novel
tegrate on Lab-on-a-Chip micro-systems, e.g.
sensor concepts, where coherent, tunable light in the vis-
ible range is desired.

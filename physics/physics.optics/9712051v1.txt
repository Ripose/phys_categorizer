Abstract – In this paper we extend for the case of Maxwell equations the “X-shaped”

solutions previously found in the case of scalar (e.g., acoustic) wave equations. Such solu-

tions are localized in theory: i.e., diﬀraction-free and particle-like (wavelets), in that they

maintain their shape as they propagate. In the electromagnetic case they are particularly

interesting, since they are expected to be Superluminal. We address also the problem of

their practical, approximate production by ﬁnite (dynamic) radiators. Finally, we discuss

the appearance of the X-shaped solutions from the purely geometric point of view of the

Special Relativity theory.

I. – INTRODUCTION

Starting with the 1915 pioneering work by H.Bateman[1], it became slowly known

that all the relativistic homogeneous wave equations —in a general sense: scalar, elec-

tromagnetic and spinorial— admit also solutions with group velocities slower than the

ordinary wave velocity in the considered medium. More recently, solutions had been con-

structed for those homogeneous wave equations with group velocities even higher than

the ordinary wave velocity in the medium[2].

In the case of acoustic waves, for instance, the existence has been shown of “sub-

sonic” and “Super-sonic” solutions in some well-known papers[3-6]. We may expect such

solutions to exist also for seismic wave equations (and perhaps in the case of gravitational

Here we shall ﬁx our attention on Maxwell equations, which is the most intriguing

case since their new solutions will be subluminal and Superluminal, respectively (i.e., with

group velocities in vacuum lower and higher than c, respectively).

In ref.[2], e.g., one

waves too).

tion”[7,8].

Only in the last few years the “subluminal” and “Superluminal” solutions of wave

equations have been systematically investigated,

in particular by Donnally and Zi-

olkowski[9] (see also refs.[10]).

Most of the attention, till now, has been paid however to the fact that some —

both among the subluminal and among the Superluminal new solutions— are localized

(wavelet-type) beams[11], which theoretically can propagate to an inﬁnite distance with-

out changing their wave shape; in other words they are “undistorted progressive waves”,

to use the Courant and Hilbert’s terminology[12]. Localized beams were discovered as

early as 1941 by Stratton[13] and rediscovered by Durnin[14] in 1987. These beams have

a priori an inﬁnite depth of ﬁeld. Durnin termed these beams “nondiﬀracting beams”, or

“diﬀraction-free beams”, while a more realistic name would be that of “limited diﬀrac-

tion” beams (or, rather, “limited dispersion”) since in all the practically realizable sit-

uations they will diﬀract (disperse) eventually[15-17]. Durnin’s beams are also called

Bessel beams because their transverse beam proﬁle is a Bessel function[14]. Bessel beams

are monochromatic and are obtained by treating as usual the (scalar) amplitude related

2

to one transverse component only of either the electric or the magnetic ﬁeld of light as

a solution to the scalar wave equation. Due to their large “depth of ﬁeld” with a zero

diﬀraction angle, limited-dispersion beams are having applications in non-destructive eval-

uation of materials[18], Doppler velocity estimation, tissue characterization, and particu-

larly medical imaging[3,16,17]. Besides in acoustics[3,16-18], they can have applications

in electromagnetism[19-21,23-25] and in optics[14,22,26,27].

But localized, non-dispersive solutions to homogeneous wave equations can play an

important theoretical rˆole in non-relativistic and relativistic Quantum Mechanics for a

suitable description of elementary particles[28] (usually described by unsuitable wave-

packets that spread even in vacuum).

II. – LOCALIZED SOLUTIONS TO FREE MAXWELL EQUATIONS

Localized beams have been studied extensively in recent years in both acoustics[29,30]

and optics[14,22].

Recently, a new family of localized beams has been discovered[4]. These beams have

been called “X waves” because they are X-shaped in a plane (r, z) passing through the

propagation axis[5,31,32]. The X-shaped waves are diﬀerent from the Bessel beams be-

cause they contain multiple frequencies, but possess the extremely important character-

istic of being non-dispersive in isotropic-homogeneous media or free space[4,5,23]. Let us

recall that Bessel beams are “localized” at a single frequency, but become dispersive for

multiple frequencies because the phase velocity of each frequency component of theirs is

Even more important, for us, is the fact that the X-shaped waves are Superlumi-

nal[5,6,9,23], i.e., propagate rigidly with Superluminal speed, while Bessel beams are

In cylindrical coordinates, localized beams propagating along the z axis can be written

respectively; Φ represents the Hertz potential (or, in other cases, the acoustic pressure, or

the velocity potential); z

c1t is a propagation term, and c1 is the velocity of the beam.
Because the variables, z and t, appear only in the propagation term in eq.(1), localized

−

beams are only a function of r and φ if z

c1t = const.; that is to say, travelling with
−
the beam at the speed of c1, one sees a constant beam pattern. This is diﬀerent from
conventional focused beams[34] and from the localized waves studied by Brittingham[19]

and other investigators[20,21,35].

In Section 3, we shall extend the theory of the X-shaped beams to electromagnetic

waves, i.e., we shall consider X-shaped wave solutions to the free Maxwell equations.

Let us start by recalling the well-known fact that, even if Maxwell’s are vector equa-

tions, in various cases such as optics and microwaves, they can be simpliﬁed, i.e., only the
scalar amplitude of one transverse component of either the electric ﬁeld E or the magnetic
ﬁeld H strength is considered, and any other components of interest are treated indepen-

dently in a similar fashion (treating light and microwaves as a scalar phenomenon). This

is approximately true —for ordinary experimental setups— under the following condi-

tions[36]: (i) the diﬀracting aperture must be large compared with a wavelength, and (ii)

the diﬀracted ﬁelds must not be observed too close to the aperture. In this case, localized

beams developed in acoustics[3,16-21] can be directly applied to electromagnetism be-

cause they share the same wave equation (this was veriﬁed even experimentally in optics

by Durnin for Bessel beams[14]).

Another way to solve the Maxwell equations is to use the (magnetic) Hertz vector
potential Φ = Φ ˆn, where ˆn is a unit vector (this implies that the electromagnetic wave
given by the Maxwell equation ∇
E = 0 is a TE (“Transverse Electric ﬁeld”) polarization
wave that is perpendicular to ˆn; for TM (“Transverse Megnetic ﬁeld”) polarization, the

·

procedure is similar). This approach is rigorous, as opposed to the scalar method above.
But one easily gets (cf., e.g., ref.[24]) expressions for E and H in terms of Φ, where the

Hertz vector potential is still a solution of the scalar wave equation. Of course, not all the

solutions of the scalar wave equation are localized. However, if Φ is a localized solution,

then also the solution of the Maxwell equations is localized (since the derivatives with

respect to the variables do not change[16] the propagation term z

c1t). Because of this,
numerous limited diﬀraction (relativistic) electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the

We shall now ﬁnd that the localized X-shaped waves discovered in the scalar case[4]

exist also in electromagnetism, i.e., hold also as solutions to Maxwell equations, by use of
the Hertz potential. Let us recall that, in terms of Φ, when ˆn is chosen in the z-direction,

It can be immediately noticed that c1 is larger than the light speed in the medium;

bump), i.e., by equating to zero the partial derivative with respect to k of the unitary

inﬁnite total energies, but ﬁnite energy densities). And, as in the case of plane waves,

any realistic X-wave (approximately produced with a ﬁnite aperture will possess a ﬁnite

energy[5]. We shall come back to this question. Let us mention that —however— Special

(Extended) Relativity [see Sect.V, below] predicts the existence also of ﬁnite-energy (non-

truncated) X-shaped waves[39]. (Moreover, ﬁnite energy, localized beams can a priori be

obtained even via suitable superpositions of X-waves, i.e., by suitable superpositions of

Bessel beams[23]).

As already mentioned, the beams represented by eq.(4) can be particle-like. As the

scaling parameter, a0, decreases, the wave-function energy density around the wave center
increases. The oﬀ-center energy density of the X-shaped waves decays slowly along the X

branches, which might provide a way to communicate with other wave particles[28,40,41].

C. – An Example

In the following, we give an example of electromagnetic X-shaped wave. For simplicity,

only the zeroth-order (n = 0) X-wave is considered. Notice that for n = 0, eqs.(4’)-(5e)
are axially symmetric (not a function of φ), and (EXBB0)r, (H XBB0)φ and (P XBB0)φ are
zero.

8

The real part of the zeroth-order scalar Hertz potential (eq.(4’)) and the electro-

magnetic X-shaped waves (eqs.(5b),(5c) and (5e)) are shown in Fig.1 (all the Figures

of this article are the same as in the electronic LANL Archives preliminary paper #

physics/9610012; Oct.15, 1996, and should be found therein: namely, Figs.1-3 were sent

in poscript form, whereas Figs.4-6 were faxed to SLAC). The Poynting ﬂux and energy

density are shown in Fig.2. Their maxima and minima are summarized in Tables I and II,

respectively (these Tables are the same as in the electronic LANL Archives preliminary

paper # physics/9610012, and can be found therein). From Table I, we see that, with

the parameters given in Fig.1, the electromagnetic X-shaped waves are almost transverse

waves where their axial components are much smaller than those of the transverse com-

ponents. This is also shown in Table II, where the axial component of the Poynting ﬂux

is at least four orders larger than its lateral components. Lateral line plots of Figs.1 and

2 along X branches are shown in Fig.3.

D. – Finite-Aperture Approximation of X-Shaped Waves and their Depth of Field.

The localized electromagnetic X-shaped waves obtained above by us are exact solu-

tions to the free-space Maxwell wave equations. In these equations, there are no boundary

conditions and thus the apertures required to produce the waves are inﬁnite; therefore,

they cannot be realized in practice. However, these waves can be approximated very well,

over a certain “depth of ﬁeld”, by truncating them in both space and time.

One important question is how far the truncated X-shaped waves can travel without

appreciable distortion, i.e., how long is their ﬁeld depth. The answer is that they travel

practically undistorted along a large depth of ﬁeld, and then they suddenly decay. This has

been shown, even experimentally, in the acoustic case[4-6,16,17], and mathematically in

the more general case of the slingshot pulses (X-shaped–type waves, found independently

in ref.[23] for the case of homogeneous, general scalar wave-equations) as well as for other

pulses[15,26]. Let us address the same question in the present (electromagnetic) case.

Because the derivatives in eqs.(3’) and (3”) do not change the cone angle ζ, the ﬁeld depth

q

of the electromagnetic X-waves is the same as that of the Hertz potential produced by

the same aperture. In addition, eq.(8) is also valid for band-limited electromagnetic X-

waves[16]. As an example, if the diameter of the aperture is 20 m and the cone angle is ζ =
0.005o, the depth of ﬁeld of both broadband and band-limited electromagnetic X-waves
is 115 km. For instance, simulation[4] of a ﬁnite aperture X-wave Hertz potential with

the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diﬀraction formula[36] and its production[5] with an acoustic

transducer have been reported in the past literature.

Another, even more important question is whether the truncated X-wave (after hav-

ing been produced, and without further support from the ﬁnite antenna) does still travel

with Superluminal group-velocity, at least along its depth of ﬁeld. One may observe that

any wave packet of the type of eq.(4), even with diﬀerent weights (as far as only z depends

on t), does not spread in the energy–impulse space;

in other words, there is not spreading

in the energy–impulse space of the wave packet even after its truncation, if the linearity

between

and

(i.e., between the coeﬃcients of z and of t in the exponential phase-

factor entering eq.(4)) is maintained. Therefore, after its emission (even if in a truncated

form, implying a distortion in the ordinary space, but not in the energy–impulse space),

the wave packet’s energetic spectrum does not change, and thus its group velocity d

/dk

is not expected to change too. We may conclude that, till when the group-velocity has

a meaning (i.e., till the abrupt decay of the truncated X-wave), vg is expected to remain
Superluminal.

E. – A digression: Localized solutions to the free Schroedinger equation.

We already mentioned that non-dispersive solutions to the quantum equations, in-

cluding Klein-Gordon’s and Dirac’s, being localized and particle-like, can well be related

to elementary particles (and they wave nature)[28,43].

Let us here make a brief di-

10

gression with respect to the particular case of the Schroedinger equation which, being

non-relativistic, presents diﬀerent problems.

It is well-known[44] that the time-independent Schroedinger and Helmholtz equations

are mathematically identical (so that, for instance, the tunnelling of a particle through and

under a barrier has been simulated by the travelling of photons in a subcritical waveguide).

Those equations are however diﬀerent (due to the diﬀerent order of the time derivative) in

the time-dependent case. Nevertheless, it can be shown that they still possess in common

classes of analogous solutions, diﬀering only in their spreading properties[45]. We are

going to see an example of this fact in the particularly simple case of free space.

The three-dimensional, time-dependent Schroedinger wave equation for free objects

is given by

where Φ = Φ(r, φ, z, t) is now the wave-function. It is easy to verify that eq.(3) is an exact

Let α0(k, ζ) =

and b(k, ζ) = ik cos ζ; we then obtain c1(k, ζ) =

p = mv, the quantity v being the particle speed. By using these last relations, and by
putting f (s) = s, T (k) = B(k) e−a0k, and A(θ) = ineinθ into eq.(3), we obtain[24] an
nth-order localized solution to the free Schroedinger equation [n = 0, 1, 2, . . .]

However, in the present non-relativistic case, the integration variable k enters the

exponential non-linearly (due to the presence of v), so that in eq.(9) the integration cannot

be performed in general (a trivial exception being, e.g., the case when the weight BJn is
gaussian). The same non-linear relation between the coeﬃcients of z and t in the phase

factor implies (at variance with the relativistic case) the existence of a spreading.

11

The group velocity is still given, as usual, by the relation ∂[kz cos ζ

kvt/2] ∂k = 0,

with v = ¯hk/m But now it is necessary to introduce[46] a mean speed, v, and only at the

price of such an averaging one can write (even in presence of the spreading) vg = v/ cos ζ.
Quantity vg can be either slower or faster than v (and even than c).

If ζ = 0, a0 = 0, and B(k′) = δ(k′

k), eq.(9) represents just a plane wave propagating

in the z-direction.

IV. – DISCUSSION

A. – Hertz vector potentials and nth-order X-shaped waves

The scalar X-shaped wave ΦXBBn in eq.(4’) satisﬁes the wave equation (2). It is the
component of a Hertz vector potential in the z direction. If n = 0, quantity ΦXBB0 is
axially symmetric and has a single peak at the wave center. For n > 0, it is zero on

the z-axis and is axially asymmetric. (When both n and ζ are zero, ΦXBBn represents
the limiting case of a plane wave.) The Hertz potential ΦXBBn, which may or may not
have a physical meaning, has been used above as an auxiliary function from which new
If ΦXBBn is treated ap-
electromagnetic X-waves are derived, through eqs.(3’) and (3”).
proximately as one component of E or of H, it has a physical meaning: Many microwave

and optical phenomena are treated this way under suitable conditions[36].

From our Hertz vector potential, Φ = Φˆz, the family of electromagnetic X-waves,

eqs.(5a)-(5e), has been obtained above, the nonnegative integer n representing the order
of the waves. Because the variable φ appears in ΦXBBn only, E and H have the same
axial symmetry as ΦXBBn. However, for n = 1, E and H are not zero on the axis z, and
they are not axially symmetric. This means they are not single-valued on the z-axis and

thus it does not seem they can be approximated with a physical device.

For some components of the electromagnetic X-waves the ﬁeld on the axial axis z is

zero. In such a case, there are multiple peaks around the X-wave center, and the energy

density is high on these peaks. For example, the energy density of the zeroth-order

electromagnetic X-wave has four sharp peaks (see Panel (3) of Fig.2). This is similar to

12

the case of Ziolkowski’s localized electromagnetic wave[21]. Notice that any higher-order

(n > 0) scalar X-shaped waves are zero on the z-axis and also produce multiple peaks[4].

For the electromagnetic X-waves given by eqs.(5a)-(5e),

component of the Poynting ﬂux (eqs.(6a)-(6c)) is in the z direction (the direction of the

vector Hertz potential) (see Table II, both Tables being in # physics/9610012).

One can make recourse to other Hertz vector potentials, like Φ = Φˆr or Φ = Φ ˆφ.
In the latter case, by using eq.(4’), we obtain electromagnetic X-waves whose electric

components stay in the radial (r,z) plane. Similarly, in the former case, if Φ is still an

X-wave solution, we obtain localized electromagnetic X-waves with their electric compo-

B. – Method to obtain other limited-dispersion electromagnetic waves

We have seen that, when new localized solutions to eq.(2) are found, the corresponding

localized electromagnetic waves can be obtained [cf.

for instance eqs.(3’)-(3”)]. There

are many ways to obtain new localized solutions to the scalar wave equation, such as

the variable substitution method, that converts any existing solutions to a localized so-

lution[48]; and the superposition method, that uses Bessel beams or rather X-waves as

basis functions to construct localized beams of practical usefulness[42].

Let us here add the observation that the sidelobes of the scalar X-shaped waves

(eq.(4)) are high along the X branches[16]. The asymptotic behavior of the electromag-

netic X-wave sidelobes are similar to that of the scalar waves (see Figs.1 and 2). Low side-

lobes are necessary for example to obtain high contrast imaging[51]. To reduce sidelobes

of the scalar X-waves in pulse-echo imaging, recently, unsymmetrical limited diﬀraction

beams such as bowtie X-waves were developed in acoustics[16]: These waves are obtained

by taking derivatives in one direction, say y, of the zeroth-order X-wave; when a bowtie
X-wave is used to transmit and its 90o-rotated beam pattern (around the z-axis) is used
to receive, sidelobes of pulse-echo imaging systems can be reduced dramatically without

compromising the image frame rate. The same technique could also be applied to the

13

electromagnetic X-shaped waves for low sidelobe imaging.

C. – Limited Dispersion and Wave Speed

Because E or H in eqs.(3’)-(3”), and in similar equations are obtained by derivatives

of the scalar X-waves in terms of their spatial and time variables, the propagation term

z

−

c1t is retained after the derivatives. Therefore, the electromagnetic X-shaped waves
are also localized beams: that is, travelling with the wave at speed c1, one will see a
constant wave pattern in space.

We have seen that the wave speed c1 of localized beams (eq.(1)) along the z axis
is greater than or equal to the speed of light (in electromagnetism or optics), or to the

speed of sound (in acoustics). For example, the speed of the X-shaped waves is c1 =

be “tachyonic” or Superluminal[39], and has been studied by many investigators in both

“particle”[7,10,49,50] and wave [4-11,23-28,49] physics.

In particular, recently (see e.g.

refs.[9,23]) it has been mathematically shown that all relativistic (homogeneous) wave

equations admit also sub- and Super-luminal solutions: a claim theoretically conﬁrmed,

e.g., in [10] (and that in the past had been veriﬁed only in some particular cases[7]).

Although the theoretical Superluminal waves encountered in this paper cannot be

exactly produced, due to their inﬁnite energy, they can be approximated with a ﬁnite

aperture radiator and retain —as we have seen above— their essential characteristics

(limited-dispersion and Superluminal group velocity) over a large depth of ﬁeld. Each

component (wavelet) of the approximated wave propagates at the speed of light (or of

sound), but the conic, or X-shaped wave, created by their superposition travels at a speed

greater than the light (or sound) speed.

The X-waves, however, do not appear to violate[7,39,49] the special theory of rel-

ativity, as we are going to discuss below in Section V, when we shall also show that

Superluminal X-shaped waves, in particular, are predicted by Relativity itself to travel in

space rigidly, without deforming[7,39].

Since Superluminal motions seem to appear even in other sectors of experimental

science, we deem it proper to present in an Appendix at the end of this paper some infor-

mation about those experimental results. In fact, the subject of Superluminal objects [or

tachyons] addressed in this paper is still regarded frequently as unconventional, and in this

14

respect it can get therefore more support from experiments than from theory. Moreover,

such pieces of information are presently scattered in four diﬀerent areas of science, and it

can be useful to ﬁnd them all collected in one and the same place.

D. – Role of superposition and interference

The X-waves considered by us are a superposition of Bessel beams and therefore

can be regarded, eventually, as linear superposition of c-speed plane waves travelling at

diﬀerent angles about the beam axis.

If the aperture is inﬁnite, plane waves will not

deform and diverge as they propagate to inﬁnity.

If the aperture is ﬁnite, plane waves

travel to a large distance in which they do not diverge signiﬁcantly: However, beyond that

large distance, plane waves, so the X-waves, start to diverge. The speed of the X-waves

along the axis, that is greater than c, is caused by the plane waves that do not travel

along the axis but at an angle (Axicon angle) with it.

If the aperture is inﬁnite, X-waves travel to inﬁnite distance without deformation:

This is because antennas continue to support the waves from the X branches which extend

to inﬁnity in time as the aperture goes to inﬁnity (remember that the X-wave extension

in time is equal to (D/2) tan ζ, where D is the diameter of the aperture and ζ is the cone

angle).

If the X-waves are truncated, they are no longer X-waves in the original sense. As

soon as truncated X-waves leave the source that produces them, they start deforming

progressively. We have seen that the truncated X-waves deforms negligibly within their

depth of ﬁeld and signiﬁcantly beyond it; the peak of the truncated X-waves happens

near the wave axis:

it travels faster than c. Beyond the support (depth of ﬁeld) of the

X branches, truncated waves start to diverge quickly.

In the limit (inﬁnite distance),

truncated X-waves behave like a spherical wave travelling at speed c.

In conclusion,

truncated X-waves can send signals at a speed greater than c only within the support

of the X branches: but this is achieved at the cost that the wave front must be leaning

forward in space to form the advanced X branches. Namely, the outmost ring of the ﬁnite

antenna has to be excited ﬁrst; then, since the waves from this ring travel at c, the peak

of the X-waves travels faster than c on the axis. The waves deform quite dramatically

near the boundary of the depth of ﬁeld d = a cot ζ, where a is the radius of the circular

aperture and ζ is the cone angle.

15

Notice that, however, the peak (vertex) of the truncated X-wave is formed with wave

components from the X branches in a continuously changing way as the beam propagates,

so that he does not represent the speed of the centroid of the beam. This is particularly

true when the arms carry large amounts of energy.

V. – A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN SPECIAL RELATIVITY

FOR THE X-SHAPED WAVES

Let us here mention that a simple theoretical framework exists[7] (merely based on

the space-time geometrical methods of Special Relativity (SR)) which incorporates the

Superluminal X-shaped waves without violating the Relativity principles.

Actually, SR can be derived from postulating: (i) the Principle of relativity; and (ii)

space-time to be homogeneous and space isotropic.

It follows that one and only one

invariant speed exists; and experience shows that invariant speed to be the one, c, of light

in vacuum (the essential role of c in SR being just due to its invariance, and not to its

being supposedly a maximal, or minimal, speed; no other, sub- or Super-luminal, object

can be endowed with an invariant speed: in other words, no bradyon or tachyon can play

in SR the same essential role as the speed-c light waves). Let us recall, incidentally, that

tachyon [a term coined in 1967 by G.Feinberg] and bradyon [a term coined in 1970 by

E.Recami] mean Superluminal and subluminal object, respectively. The speed c turns

out to be a limiting speed: but any limit possesses two sides, and can be approached a

priori both from below and from above. (As E.C.G.Sudarshan put it, from the fact that

no one could climb over the Himalayas ranges, people of India cannot conclude that there

are no people North of the Himalayas...; actually, speed-c photons exist, which are born,

live and die just “at the top of the mountain,” without any need to accelerate from rest

to the light speed).

A consequence is that the quadratic form ds2 = c2dt2

dz2 (i.e., the four-
dimensional length-element square, along the space-time path of any object) results to be

dx2

dy2

−

−

−

invariant, except for its sign. In correspondence with the positive (negative) sign, one gets

the subluminal (Superluminal) Lorentz transformations [LT]. The ordinary, subluminal

LTs leave, e.g., the fourvector squares and the scalar products (between fourvectors) just

16

invariant.

The Superluminal LTs can be easily written down only in two dimensions (or in six,

or in eight, dimensions...). But they must have the properties of changing sign, e.g., to

the fourvector squares and to the fourvector scalar products. This is enough to deduce

—see Fig.4— that a particle, which is spherical when at rest (and which appears then as

ellipsoidal, due to Lorentz contraction, at subluminal speeds v), will appear[7,39,41,51]

as occupying the cylindrically symmetrical region bounded by a two-sheeted rotation

hyperboloid and an indeﬁnite double cone, as in Fig.4(d), for Superluminal speeds V .

In Fig.4 the motion is along the x-axis.

In the limiting case of a point-like particle,

one obtains only a double cone.

In 1980-1982, therefore, it was predicted[39] that the

simplest Superluminal object appears (not as a particle, but as a ﬁeld or rather) as a

wave: namely, as a “X-shaped wave”, the cone semi-angle α being given (with c = 1) by
cot α = √V 2

1.

It was also predicted[39,51] that the X-shaped waves would move rigidly with speed

V along their motion direction (Fig.5). The reason for such “X-waves” to travel without

deformation is quite simple: every X-wave can be regarded at each instant of time as the

(Superluminal) Lorentz transform of a spherical object, which of course as time elapses

−

moves in vacuum without any deformation.

The X-shaped waves here considered are the most simple ones only. If we started not

from an intrinsically spherical or point-like object, but from a non-spherically symmetric

particle, or from a pulsating (contracting and dilating) sphere, or from a particle oscillating

back and forth along the motion direction, their Superluminal Lorentz transforms would

result to be more and more complicated. The above-seen X-waves, however, are typical for

a Superluminal object, so as the spherical or point-like shape is typical for a subluminal

particle.

The three dimensional picture of Fig.5, or rather of Fig.4(d), appears in Fig.6, where

its annular intersections with a transverse plane are shown (cf. refs.[39,51]).

It has been believed for a long time that Superluminal objects would have allowed

sending information into the past; but such problems with causality seem to be solvable

within SR. Once SR is generalized in order to include tachyons, no signal travelling back-

wards in time is apparently left. For a solution of those causal paradoxes, see refs.[49,50]

and references therein.

17

Let us pass, within this elementary context, to the problem of producing a “X-shaped

wave” like the one depicted in Fig.6 (truncated of course, in space and in time, by use

of a ﬁnite antenna radiating for a ﬁnite time interval). To convince ourselves about

the possibility of realizing them, it is enough to consider na¨ıvely the ideal case of a

Superluminal source S of negligible size, endowed with constant speed V and emitting

spherical electromagnetic waves W (each one travelling at the invariant speed c). We

shall observe the electromagnetic waves to be internally tangent to an enveloping cone C

having the source motion line x as its axis and S as its vertex. This is analogous to what

happens with an airplane moving with a constant supersonic speed in the air. In addition,

those electromagnetic waves W interfere negatively one another inside the cone C, and

interfere constructively only on its surface. We can put a plane detector orthogonal to x

and record the intensity and direction of the waves W impinging on it, as a (cylindrically

symmetric) function of position and of time. Afterwards, it will be enough to replace the

plane detector by a plane antenna that radiates —instead of detecting and recording—

exactly the same (cylindrically symmetrical) space-time pattern of electromagnetic waves

W, in order to build up a cone-shaped (C ) electromagnetic wave travelling along x with

the Superluminal speed V (obviously, with no radiating source any longer —now— at its

vertex S ). Even if each spherical wave W will still travel with the invariant speed c.

Incidentally, the above-mentioned evaluation can lead to a very simple type of “X-

shaped wave.”

These examples are to be completed, however, by recalling that Special Relativity

implies considering also the forward cone: cf. Fig.6. The truncated X-waves considered

in this paper, for instance, must have a leading cone in addition to the rear cone; such

a leading cone having an essential role for the peak travelling faster than c.

In other

words, in the approximated case in which we produce a ﬁnite conic wave truncated both

in space and in time, the theory of SR suggested the bi-conic shape (symmetrical in space

with respect to the vertex S) to be a priori a better approximation to a rigidly travelling

wave; so that SR suggests to have recourse to an antenna emitting a radiation (not only

cylindrically symmetrical in space but also) symmetric in time, for a better approximation

to an undistorted progressive wave.

Let us recall once more that our truncated (ﬁnite) bi-conic, or X-shaped, waves (af-

ter having been produced) are expected to travel almost rigidly, at Superluminal speed,

18

without any further support from the radiator, all along their depth of ﬁeld (but only

along such depth of ﬁeld).

One may observe, at last, that in the vacuum and in homogeneous media for the (non

truncated) X-shaped waves the group velocity coincides with the phase velocity.

VI. – CONCLUSION

We have derived and considered various localized X-shaped solutions to the free

Maxwell equations, which possess Superluminal group velocities. Theoretically, these

solutions are dispersion-free. They are inﬁnitely extended in space and time, and —the

ones met in this work— possess inﬁnite total energy. However, for solutions that are

single valued and non-singular (ﬁnite energy density), they can be approximated very

well by a ﬁnite aperture antenna over a large depth of interest (along which the trun-

cated X-shaped waves maintain their essential characteristics of limited-dispersion and

Superluminal velocity).

In addition, localized, limited-dispersion wave solutions to the

quantum equations can be helpful for a better understanding of the relationship between

waves and particles. Because (practically realizable) localized beams have a large depth

of ﬁeld, they have and can have applications in several areas, from electromagnetism,

communications and optics to acoustics and geophysics.

As explained in Sect.IV–C above, we use the present occasion to present in the Ap-

pendix below some information about the other sectors of experimental science in which

Superluminal motions seem to appear.

VIII. – APPENDIX

In this Appendix we take the opportunity to present some sketchy information —

mainly bibliographical— about the other three (in total, four) sectors of experimental

science in which Superluminal motions seem to appear. In fact, as the “Superluminal”

topic is still controversial, a panoramic view of the overall experimental situation is cer-

tainly useful, especially when it is considered that the related information, scattered in

very diﬀerent Journals, is not all of easy access to everybody.

The question of Superluminal objects or waves [tachyons] has a long story, starting

perhaps with Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura. Still in pre-relativistic times, let us recall

e.g. the contributions by A.Sommerfeld.

In relativistic times, our problem started to

be tackled again essentially in the ﬁfties and sixties, in particular after the papers by

E.C.George Sudarshan et al., and later on by E.Recami, R.Mignani et al. [who by their

numerous works at the beginning of the seventies rendered, by the way, the terms sub- and

Super-luminal of popular use], as well as by H.C.Corben and others (to conﬁne ourselves

to the theoretical researches). For references, one can check pages 162-178 in ref.[7],

where about 600 citations are listed; or the large bibliographies by V.F.Perepelitsa[52]

and the book in ref.[53]. In particular, for the causality problems one can see refs.[49,50]

and references therein, while for a model theory for tachyons in two dimensions one can

be addressed to refs.[7,8]. The ﬁrst experiments looking for tachyons were performed

by T.Alvager et al.; some citations about the early experimental quest for Superluminal

objects being found e.g. in refs.[7,54].

20

The subject of tachyons is presently returning after fashion, especially because of the

fact that four diﬀerent experimental sectors of physics seem to indicate the existence of

Superluminal objects; including —of course— the one dealt with in this and in other

papers of ours: which appears to us as being at the moment the most important sector.

Let us put forth in the following some brief information about the experimental results

obtained in such diﬀerent science areas.

1. – Negative square-mass neutrinos

Since 1971 it was known that the experimental square-mass of muon-neutrinos resulted to

be negative[55]. If conﬁrmed, this would correspond (within the ordinary naive approach

to relativistic particles) to an imaginary mass and therefore to a Superluminal speed.

[In a non-naive approach[7], i.e. within a Special Relativity theory extended to include

tachyons (Extended Relativity), the free tachyon “dispersion relation” (with c = 1) be-
p2 =
comes actually E2
0, so that one does not have to associate tachyons with
imaginary-mass particles!].

From the theoretical point of view, let us refer to [56] and references therein.

It is rather important that recent experiments showed that also electron-neutrinos

have negative mass-square[57].

2. – Galactic “Mini-Quasars”

We refer ourselves to the apparent Superluminal expansions observed inside quasars, some

galaxies, and —as discovered very recently— in some galactic objects, preliminarily called

“mini-quasars”. Since 1971 in many quasars apparent Superluminal expansions were ob-

served [Nature, for instance, dedicated a cover of its to those observations on 2 Apr.1981].

Such seemingly Superluminal expansions were the consequence of the experimentally mea-

sured angular separation rates, once it was taken account of the (large) distance of the

sources from the Earth. From the experimental point of view, it will be enough to quote

the book [58] and references therein.

The distance of those “Superluminal sources”, however, is not well-known; or, at

least, the (large) distances usually adopted have been strongly criticized by H.Arp et al.,

who maintain that quasars are much nearer objects than expected: so that all the above-

mentioned data can no longer be easily used to infer (apparent) Superluminal motions.

21

However, very recently, galactic objects have been discovered, in which apparent Super-

luminal expansions occur; and the distance of the galactic objects can be more precisely

determined. For the experimental point of view, see refs.[59].

For a theoretical point of view, both for quasars and “mini-quasars”, see refs.[7,60].

In particular, let us recall that a single Superluminal source of light would just be ob-

served: (i) initially, in the phase of “optic boom” (analogous to the acoustic “boom” by

an aircraft that travels with constant super-sonic speed) as a suddenly-appearing intense

source; (ii) later on, as a source which splits into TWO objects receding one from the

other with relative velocity V larger than 2c.

3. – Tunnelling photons = Evanescent waves

It is the sector that most attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc and non-scientiﬁc

press[61].

Evanescent waves were predicted [cf., e.g., ref.[7], page 158 and references therein] to

be faster-than-light. Even more, they consist in tunnelling photons: and it was known

since long time[62] that tunnelling particles (wave packets) can move with Superluminal

group–velocities inside the barrier; therefore, due to the theoretical analogies between

tunnelling particles (e.g., electrons) and tunnelling photons[63], it was since long expected

that evanescent waves could be Superluminal.

The ﬁrst experiments have been performed in Cologne, Germany, by Guenter Nimtz

et al., and published in 1992. See refs.[64].

Important experiments have been performed in Berkeley: see refs.[65].

Further experiments on Superluminal evanescent waves have been done in Flo-

rence[66]; while a last experiment (as far as we know) took place in Vienna[66].

From the theoretical point of view, see refs.[62] and references therein; and refs.[67].

4. – Superluminal motions in Electrical and Acoustical Engineering — The “X-shaped

waves”

This fourth sector, which this paper is contributing to, seems to be at the moment (to-

gether with the third one) the most promising.

Starting with the pioneering work by H.Bateman, it became slowly known that all

the relativistic homogeneous wave equations —in a general sense: scalar, electromagnetic

22

and spinorial— admit solutions with subluminal group velocities[1]. More recently, also

Superluminal solutions have been constructed for those homogeneous wave equations,

in refs.[2,10] and quite independently in refs.[6,9,23]:

in some cases just by applying

a Superluminal Lorentz “transformation”[7,8].

It has been shown that an analogous

situation is met even for acoustic waves, with the existence in this case of “sub-sonic” and

“Super-sonic” solutions[3,4];

so that one can expect they to exist, e.g., also for seismic

wave equations. (More intriguingly, one might expect the same to be true in the case of

gravitational waves too).

Let us recall that the rigidly travelling Supersonic and Superluminal solutions found

in refs.[4,5,23,27] and in this paper —some of them already experimentally realized—

appear to be (generally speaking) X-shaped, just as predicted in 1980/1982 by Barut,

Recami and Maccarrone[39].

On this regard, from the theoretical point of view, let us quote pages 116-117, and

pages 59 (ﬁg.19) and 141 (ﬁg.42), of ref.[7]; and even more refs.[7,41,51], where “X-type

waves” are predicted and discussed. From such papers it results also clear why the X-

shaped waves keep their form while travelling (non-dispersive waves).

Fig.4. Let us consider an object that is intrinsically spherical, i.e., that is a sphere in

24

its rest-frame (Panel (a)). After a generic subluminal Lorentz transformation (LT) along

x, i.e., under a subluminal x-boost, it is predicted by special relativity (SR) to appear as

ellipsoidal due to Lorentz contraction (Panel (b)). After a Superluminal x-boost (namely,

when this object moves with Superluminal speed V ), it is predicted by extended relativ-

ity (ER) to appear[7,39] as in Panel (d), i.e., as occupying the cylindrically symmetric

region bounded by a two-sheeted rotation hyperboloid and an indeﬁnite double cone. The

whole structure is predicted by ER to move rigidly[39] and, of course, with the speed V ,
the cotangent square of the cone semi-angle being (V /c)2
limiting case when the boost-speed tends to c, either from the left or from the right. (For

1. Panel (c) refers to the

−

simplicity, a space axis is skipped).

Fig.5. If we start from a spherical particle as in Fig.4(a), then —after a Superluminal

boost along a generic motion line l— we obtain the tachyonic object T depicted in this

ﬁgure. Once more, the Superluminal object T appears to be spread over the whole spa-

tial region delimited by a double cone and a two-sheeted hyperboloid asymptotic to the

cone[51]. The whole structure travels of course along l with the speed V of the Super-

luminal l-boost. Notice that, if the object is not spherical when at rest (but, e.g., is

ellipsoidal in its own rest-frame), then the axis of T will no longer coincide with l, but

its direction will depend on the speed V of the tachyon itself. For the case in which the

space extension of the Superluminal object T is ﬁnite, see ref.[41].

Fig.6. Here we show the intersections of the Superluminal object T with planes P

orthogonal to its motion line (the x-axis) for the same case as in Fig.4. For simplicity, we

assumed again the object to be spherical in its rest-frame, and the cone vertex to coincide

with the origin O for t = 0. Such intersections evolve in time so that the same pattern

appears on a second plane —shifted by ∆x after the time ∆t = ∆x/V . On each plane,

as time elapses, the intersection is therefore predicted by ER to be a circular ring which,

for negative times, goes on shrinking until it reduces to a circle and then to a point (for

t = 0); afterwards, such a point becomes again a circle and then a circular ring that goes

on broadening[7,39,41,51].

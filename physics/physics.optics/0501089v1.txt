Role of spatial coherence in polarization tomography

We analyze an experimental setup in which a quasi-monochromatic spatially coherent beam of
light is used to probe a paraxial optical scatterer. We discuss the eﬀect of the spatial coherence of
the probe beam on the Mueller matrix representing the scatterer. We show that according to the
degree of spatial coherence of the beam, the same scattering system can be represented by diﬀerent
Mueller matrices. This result should serve as a warning for experimentalists.

A great deal of literature exists about the phenomeno-
logical treatment of polarization of light by matrix meth-
ods [1]. Among these methods, the Mueller-Stokes
one is perhaps the most utilized for the description of
the interaction between a quasi-monochromatic beam of
light, hereafter denoted as the probe, and a polarization-
aﬀecting medium, namely the scattering system. In the
Mueller-Stokes formalism the beam of light is represented
by four real numbers, namely the Stokes parameters, and
the scattering system is represented by a 4 × 4 real ma-
trix, the Mueller matrix. Recently [2], considerable ef-
forts have been devoted to the study of the connection
between the algebraic properties of Mueller matrices and
the corresponding physical properties of the systems they
represent. However, in most contributions [1, 2] empha-
sis is given to the mathematical aspects of the problem
rather than to the physical ones.

On the contrary, in the present Letter we study how
the spatial coherence of the probe beam aﬀects the phys-
ical properties of the Mueller matrix representing a given
scattering system. Using Wolf’s uniﬁed theory of coher-
ence and polarization of random electromagnetic beams
[3], we demonstrate that the same scattering system can
be represented by diﬀerent Mueller matrices, the diﬀer-
ence depending on the degree of spatial coherence of the
probe beam. Speciﬁcally, we show that an optical scat-
terer may behave either as a non-depolarizing or a de-
polarizing system according to whether the probe beam
was completely spatially coherent or completely spatially
incoherent.

A typical experimental setup for polarization tomog-
raphy consists of ﬁve elementary units: The source S,
the polarization-preparer P, the scattering system M [4],
the polarization-analyzer A, and the detector D (see Fig.
1). The source S emits a quasi-monochromatic beam of
light at frequency ω, which is prepared by P in a well
deﬁned pure polarization state. This beam propagates
close to the z-axis through a scattering system charac-
terized by its spectral transmission matrix Gij (r1, r0, ω),
(i = x, y; j = x, y), where r0 = (ρ0, z0), r1 = (ρ1, z1),
and ρA = (xA, yA), (A = 0, 1), are the transverse posi-
tion vectors on the input (z = z0) and output (z = z1)

planes, respectively. Let Ej(r0, ω), (j = x, y) be a spec-
tral Cartesian components of the electric ﬁeld at the
point Q0 of coordinates r0 = (ρ0, z0), in the input plane.
The Cartesian components of the electric ﬁeld at the
point P1 of coordinates r1 = (ρ1, z1) in the output plane
are then given by:

Ei(r1, ω) =

d2ρ0 Gij (r1, r0, ω)Ej(r0, ω),

(1)

Z

(i = x, y; j = x, y), where the integration extends over
the transverse input-plane coordinates: d2ρ0 = dx0dy0,
and summation on repeated indices is understood. Be-
hind the scatterer, the polarization-analyzer A can select
an arbitrary ﬁeld component E(r1, ω) = axEx(r1, ω) +
ayEy(r1, ω), where ax, ay are complex amplitudes de-
termined by the analyzer setup. Finally, the detector
D detects the spectral density S(r1, ω) (proportional to
the averaged electric ﬁeld density) of the beam at the
point P1: S(r1, ω) = hE(r1, ω)E∗(r1, ω)i, where angular
brackets denote the average over an ensemble of real-
izations of the scattered electric ﬁeld [5]. This expres-
sion for S(r1, ω) is a particular case of the more general
formula S(r, ω) = Tr{W(r, ω)} [6], where Tr{W(r, ω)}
denotes the trace of the 2 × 2 spectral density matrix
W(r, ω) ≡ W(r, r, ω) evaluated at the point P (speciﬁed
by the position vector r), and W(rA, rB, ω) is the cross-
spectral density matrix of the beam at the pair of points

Eq. (4) shows that unlike the Stokes parameters {Sα}
in the elementary theory of partial polarization, the spec-
tral density Stokes parameters {Sα(r1, ω)} at any point
P1 in the output plane are not just a linear combi-
nation of the input spectral density Stokes parameters
{Sα(r0, ω)} but they are expressed in terms of the cross-
spectral density Stokes parameters {Jβ(r′

pairs of points ρ′

viously represents the eﬀect of the coherence of the in-
put beam. Moreover, since for r′

So far we have been concerned with a generic spatially
coherent light source, without specifying its degree of co-
herence. We shall now consider with some detail the

2

two opposite limit cases of completely coherent and com-
pletely incoherent light. For both cases we consider a uni-
formly polarized input beam speciﬁed by the coordinate-
and frequency-independent two-dimensional unit vector
e = (ex, ey), such that Ei(r0, ω) = eiE(r0, ω), (i = x, y),
where E(r0, ω) is a scalar function of the point Q0 in the
input plane. Using this assumption, one readily obtains
the following expression for the cross-spectral density ma-
trix of the input beam:

0, r′′

0 , ω),

Wkl(r′

0 , ω) = Eklw(r′
0, r′′
where Ekl ≡ eke∗
0 , ω)i
is the scalar cross-spectral density function which charac-
terize the second-order coherence properties of the input
beam. If we substitute Eq. (7) into Eq. (4) and use Eqs.
(5-6) we obtain

where Sβ ≡ Tr{σ(β)E}, (β = 0, 1, 2, 3), are the input

where u(r0, ω) represents the complex disturbance of the
ﬁeld in the input plane [10]. From Eqs. (8) and (9) read-
ily follows that Sα(r1, ω) = M (C)
αβ (r1, ω)Sβ where the “co-
herent” Mueller matrix M(C)(r1, ω) at the output point
P1 is deﬁned as

(10) shows that in the ideal case
of a completely coherent and uniformly polarized probe
beam, the Mueller matrix M (C)
αβ (r1, ω) is a Mueller-Jones
matrix [2] representing a non-depolarizing scattering sys-
tem.

If we substitute Eq. (11) in Eq. (8)
we obtain Sα(r1, ω) = M (I)
αβ (r1, ω)Sβ where the “inco-
herent” Mueller matrix M(I)(r1, ω) at the output point
P1 is deﬁned as

(12) expresses the
incoherent Mueller matrix M(I)(r1, ω) as a linear com-
bination, with non-negative coeﬃcients w(r′
0, ω), of
the Mueller-Jones matrices Mαβ(r1, r′
0, ω). Therefore
M(I)(r1, ω) is formally equivalent to a Mueller matrix
representing a depolarizing scattering system [4]. More-
over, from Eq. (12) readily follows that the Hermitian
matrix H [11] associated with M(I)(r1, ω) is positive
semideﬁnite, namely M(I)(r1, ω) satisfy the so called
Jones criterion and can be referred to as a “physical”
Mueller matrix [2].

Eqs.

(10) and (12) are the key results of this Let-
they give the Mueller matrices M(C)(r1, ω) and
ter:
M(I)(r1, ω) describing the same scattering system probed
by either a completely coherent or a completely incoher-
ent light beam, respectively. Surprisingly, we have found
that in the ﬁrst case M(C)(r1, ω) is a Mueller-Jones ma-
trix which represents a non-depolarizing optical system,
while in the second case M(I)(r1, ω) is a Jones-derived (or
“physical”) Mueller matrix that represents a depolarizing
optical system.

(4-6,8).

In particular Eq.

The more general (and realistic) case of partially co-
herent quasi-monochromatic light probe is illustrated
by Eqs.
(5) shows that
when a partially coherent probe beam is used, the
cross-spectral density Mueller matrix may not be inter-
preted as a Mueller-Jones matrix. However, since in
general the cross-spectral density function can be ex-
panded as a superposition of coherent ﬁelds {un(ρ0, ω)}
as w(r′
0 , ω) [5],
where γn(z0, ω) ≥ 0, it is easy to see that the “partially-

M(n)(r1, ω) depends in a nontrivial way on the ﬁeld-

when using spatially coherent probe beams, the linearity
required by the Mueller-Stokes formalism can be ensured
only with respect to the polarization degrees of freedom
of the beam (viz, the matrix indices), but not with
respect to the spatial degrees of freedom.

In conclusion, we have shown that, contrary to com-
mon belief, the Mueller matrix representing an optical
system in a scattering experiment, is not determined by
the system only but strongly depends on the spatial co-

3

herence of the probe beam. This fact poses serious limi-
tations to the range of applicability of the Mueller-Stokes
formalism. Consider, for instance, the following case: a
probe beam propagates through a medium suﬀering mul-
tiple scattering. Since the degree of spatial coherence of
the beam changes during propagation [13], the last part
of the medium will be probed by a beam qualitatively
diﬀerent from the one which probed the ﬁrst part of the
medium. Therefore the Mueller matrix representing the
medium will not only be determined by the polarization
properties of the medium itself, but also by the way the
medium aﬀects the coherence properties of the probe
beam. With respect to this problem, the use of com-
pletely spatially incoherent probe beams for polarization
tomography seems highly preferable.

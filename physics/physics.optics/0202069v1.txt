Gouy’s phase of transversally limited pulses can create a strong anomalous dispersion in vacuum
leading to highly superluminal and negative group velocities. As a consequence, a focusing pulse
can diverge beyond the focus before converging into it. A simple experiment is proposed.

Propagation of light pulses at superluminal velocities
has received a good deal of attention in recent years
[1, 2, 3]. Superluminal group velocities in light pulses
have been predicted and experimentally demonstrated in
evanescent modes of undersized waveguides [1], in X-
Besssel waves [2], and in pulses travelling in transpar-
ent materials with pronounced enough anomalous disper-
sion [3], one of the most striking results being a negative
superluminal group velocity of an undeformable pulse,
which in practice means that the pulse exits the disper-
sive material before entering [3].

In this letter we show that arbitrarily high and negative
group velocities in temporally undeformable pulses are
also possible in vacuum as an eﬀect of the phase anomaly
[4], or Gouy’s phase associated to diﬀraction.

In fact, slight superluminal behavior in collimated [5]
and focused [6] pulsed Gaussian beam has been recently
described. Though these results were obtained under the
approximate paraxial theory of light beam propagation
[7], they have been shown to be correct and accurate from
the nonparaxial vectorial Kirchhoﬀ-Sommerfeld diﬀrac-
tion formula [6, 8].

Discrepancy of the group velocity from c in arbitrary
pulsed light beams is shown here to be a consequence of
the frequency dependence of Gouy’s phase, a dispersion
which can be controlled by properly selecting the pulse
transversal proﬁle. We then ﬁnd it rather simple, by us-
ing standard optics such as a lens and a radially graded
mirror [9, 10], to generate a strong enough anomalous
dispersion so as to produce arbitrarily high superluminal
and negative group velocities in a focusing pulse, whose
temporal form is moreover found to remain nearly un-
changed.

Let us start by considering the three-dimensional wave

packet, or pulsed light beam

r = (x2 + y2)1/2, that results from the superposition of
monochromatic light beams ˆEω(r, z) of diﬀerent frequen-
cies ω.

All components ˆEω(r, z) are assumed to be parax-
ial about the positive z-axis, and further to have, for
simplicity, revolution symmetry around this axis. The
slowly varying complex amplitude ˆψω(r, z) of the parax-
ial light beam ˆEω(r, z) [i.e., ˆEω = ˆψω exp(iωz/c), with
c the vacuum light speed of plane waves] obeys the
paraxial wave equation ∆⊥ ˆψω + 2i(ω/c)∂z ˆψω = 0, where
∆⊥ = ∂xx + ∂yy = (1/r)∂r(r∂r) is the transversal Lapla-
cian. Writing ˆψω = aω exp(iφω), i.e., in terms of its
Iω(r, z) > 0 [squared root
real amplitude aω(r, z) =
of intensity Iω(r, z)] and phase φω(r, z), it is a straigh-
p
forward calculation to obtain the propagation equa-

tion for the on-axis (r = 0) phase φω(z)
or Gouy’s phase, as ∂zφω(z) = (c/2ω)Cω(z), where
Cω(z)
|r=0/aω(0, z), and we have assumed
that the light beam is smooth enough at on-axis points
|r=0 = 0]. The axial variation of the Gouy’s
[∂rφ(r, z)
phase ∂zφ(z) of a monochromatic light beam can thus
be inferred from the property of the transversal inten-
sity proﬁle Cω(z), an easily measurable quantity having
an intuitive meaning: If the normalized intensity pro-
ﬁle is expanded in power series about r = 0, we obtain
Iω(r, z)/Iω(0, z) = 1 + (1/2)Cω(z)r2 + . . .; thus Cω(z)
gives the concavity of the intensity proﬁle at r = 0.

If our wavepacket E(r, z, t) has the form of enveloped
oscillations of a certain carrier frequency ω0, then aω(z)
1,
is a narrow function of frequency around ω0 (∆ω/ω0
∆ω being, e.g., the half-width at 1/e maximum am-
plitude). The phase and group velocities at which the
carrier oscillations and the envelope propagate in vac-
uum are given, respectively, by [4] vp = ω0/∂z[ω0z/c +
φω0 (z)] and vg = 1/∂z[ωz/c + φω(z)]′
ω0, where the prime
sign means diﬀerentiation with respect to ω.
It is
then seen that discrepancies of vp and vg from c are
due, respectively, to axial and frequency dependence
of Gouy’s phase, dependences that originate, also re-
spectively, from transversal limitation of the wave (i.e.,
from diﬀraction) and the frequency-dependent nature
of the diﬀraction phenomenon. Negative group veloci-

ties (with the physical sense discussed by Wang et al.
[3]) are in principle allowed by omitting the absolute
value in the rigorous deﬁnition of group velocity [4].
Since ∂zφ(z) = (c/2ω)Cω(z), the alternative expressions

can be readily found. The values of vp and vg at a
given cross section z of a pulsed beam can be then pre-
dicted from the transversal proﬁle of the monochromatic
light beam at ω0 and neighbouring frequencies.
It is
worthwhile to note that the above expressions of vp and
vg can be formally obtained from the well-known for-

requirement to produce a desired superluminality is to
introduce a suitable variation with frequency of the con-
cavity of the transversal proﬁle of the monochromatic
components. These variations can be easily generated
in laboratory using simple optical elements as lenses, or
suitably designed ﬁlters:

Growth of width with frequency must be obtained
making use of the spatially dispersive properties of cer-
tain optical systems. A fair possibility is the use of
graded mirrors or transparencies [9] made of a stack of
dielectric layers, [10] like the rather simple one shown in
Fig. 1a. Such a device is designed to produce a cer-
tain transversal proﬁle
iωR
when illuminated with a speciﬁc frequency ωR. When
illuminated with neighboring frequencies, however, we
have found that the produced proﬁle changes, and in
particular its spot size grows signiﬁcantly with frequency.
Fig. 1b shows the frequency-dependent width of the out-
put amplitude proﬁle when the multilayer is illuminated
with Gaussian beams of diﬀerent frequencies but con-
stant width.

To investigate in more detail the eﬀects associated
to inﬁnite or negative vg, we have simulated the fo-
cusing of the pulsed beam E(r, t) whose spectrum
ˆEω(r) = ˆPω exp(
L,ω) has a frequency-dependent
width sL,ω. Using standard rules of Gaussian beam
propagation [7], the spectrum amplitude at any propa-
gation distance z beyond the lens is given by aω(r, z) =

focus (ξ = 0), Eq. (8) reduces to Eq. (4) with the identi-
ﬁcation s2
iω0 . The curve vg(z) is shown in Fig.
2 for typical sets of parameters. The form of the curve is
solely determined by Nω0. A maximum is reached at an
intermediate point between the focus z = f and the waist
position z0 = f /[1+1/π2N 2
ω0] of the Gaussian beam with
frequency ω0. If Nω0 is large enough, the asymmetry of
the curve vg(z) with respect to z = f becomes inappre-
ciable. The maximum enhances with increasing conver-
gence angle sL,ω0/f . Moreover, for given sL,ω0/f (as in

3

the three curves in Figs. 2a and b), arbitrary enhance-
ments are achieved by increasing s′
L,ω0. For instance, in
Fig.2b, ω0s′
L,ω0/sL,ω0 = 600 (so that the lhs of (5) is 2/3
the rhs). Then an extended region with negative vg ap-
pears around the focus. This region plays a similar role
as the gas cell in the experiments of Ref. 3.

The behavior of a pulse with such an unusual vg is
more easily understood from Fig. 3a. The solid curve
shows the arrival time of the pulse peak (that travels
at velocity vg) at axial position z, as determined by the
pulse front equation [4] t = [ωz/c+φω(0, z)]′
ω0. The slope
of the curve yields the group velocity in units of c. At
zA and zB, vg is inﬁnite, and negative between them. As
a consequence (as is apparent from the curve), the pulse
peak may arrive earlier at axial points behind the focus
than at points before the focus, e.g., earlier at zB than at
zA. The inﬁnite group velocity at zB can be associated
to the fact that the pulse peak appears to arrive instantly
at zB from zC. Indeed, in the interval (tC , tA), the pulse
peak arrives at three positions at the same time.

Of course, the above interpretation for the behavior
of the pulse peak is valid if the pulse temporal form
does not experience signiﬁcant deformation during prop-
agation, in which case it is also valid for any tempo-
ral feature of the pulse.
In Fig. 3b we have numer-
ically veriﬁed that this is the case. The pulsed beam
of spectrum on the lens ˆEω(r) = ˆPω exp(
L,ω),
−
with ˆPω = √π(b/2) exp[
ω0)2/2] [i.e., P (t) =
t2/b2)] was propagated behind the lens according
exp(
to the Gaussian beam rules [7], and the time-domain
ﬁeld was obtained from numerical integration of Eq. (1),
with ω0 = 1.571 fs−1, sL,ω0 = 0.096 mm, f = 1.92
mm, and s′
L,ω0 = 36.67 mm fs (to obtain, as in Figs.
2b and 3a, the values Nω0 = 4, sL,ω0/f = 0.05 and
ω0s′
L,ω0/sL,ω0 = 600). Condition (7) is satisﬁed taking
10−3 fs−1, or b = 2/∆ω = 1528 fs. Fig. 3b
∆ω = 1.309
shows the normalized pulse temporal form at zA = 1.861
mm and zB = 1.974 mm (points A and B of Fig.3a).
There is no appreciable deformation in the pulse, which
arrives at zB (after the focus) 109 fs earlier than at zA
(before the focus). At other distances z, we have also
observed pulse form invariance. The arrival time of pulse
peak at each selected z is shown (small squares) in Fig.
3a.

Fig.

4 oﬀers a more complete oﬀ-axis picture of
the propagation. The pulse front surface t = [ωz/c +
φω(r, z)]′
ω0 , or surface formed by all points of equal peak
time, is depicted at some instants of time. When the
convergent front advancing towards the focus intersects
the axis at zC, a new elliptical branch is born at posi-
tion zB beyond the focus (curves 1), starting its motion
. At t = 6400 (1 fs later than curve 3),
with vg =
the two branches join, transforming into a planar front
that coincides with the focal plane and backpropagates
2c, and a nearly elliptical front around the fo-
at vg ≃ −

∞

cus. At longer times (curves 4-6), the situation is nearly
reversed; in particular, a branch of the front implodes
In short, the pulse peak (or any
at zA with vg =
other pulse feature) diverges from the axial point zB > f
before it reaches the focal plane. Indeed, the converging
front never reaches this plane, but dies out at zA < f .

According to our analysis, strong superluminality in
vacuum, including negative group velocities, could be ex-
perimentally demonstrated by focusing rather arbitrary
pulses, under the only condition that the spot size varies
with frequency appropriately. The required variation
has been shown to be loosely attained with a multilayer
graded mirror. Other devices are under study. Superlu-
minality is here an eﬀect of the dephasing between the
diﬀerent spectral components of the pulse due to the fre-
quency dependence of Gouy’s phase.

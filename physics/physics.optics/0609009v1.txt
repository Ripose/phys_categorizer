The far-ﬁeld emission of two dimensional (2D) stadium-shaped dielectric cavities is investigated.
Micro-lasers with such shape present a highly directional emission. We provide experimental evi-
dence of the dependance of the emission directionality on the shape of the stadium, in good agree-
ment with ray numerical simulations. We develop a simple geometrical optics model which permits
to explain analytically main observed features. Wave numerical calculations conﬁrm the results.

The ﬁeld of quantum chaos has widely broadened over
the last two decades [1]. Generally, it relates the quantum
behavior of a broad diversity of systems with their classi-
cal features. In this context, lossless billiards are models
of great interest, providing a broad variety of dynamical
systems by changing the shape of the boundary. More-
over they are accessible to experimental studies [2, 3].
In the same time, the inﬂuence of loss or noise on open
quantum systems is also being investigated [4], with em-
phasis on the behavior of open quantum systems with
chaotic classical dynamics [5, 6, 7]. Flat micro-lasers ex-
hibiting diﬀerent boundary shapes are relevant examples
of open billiards with a coherent output coupling [8].

Here we focus on polymer micro-lasers of the Buni-
movich stadium shape. Such billiard is the archetype of
chaotic systems [9]. Stadium billiards look like a rectan-
gle of length 2l between two half-circles of diameter 2r,
accounted the form ratio l/r (see Fig. 1). Though all pe-
riodic orbits are unstable, dielectric micro-cavities with
this shape are well-behaved lasers with highly directional
emission in the far-ﬁeld pattern [10]. Aside from quan-
tum chaos studies, such micro-resonators are also being
considered for applications in integrated optics and bio-
logical sensors [11].

This letter is devoted to the investigation of the direc-
tional emission versus the form ratio as a way to infer
general behavior for such dynamical systems. First we
present experimental results and show a good agreement
with ray numerical simulations. Then we develop a sim-
ple ray model which permits to describe analytically main
observed features. All these results are ﬁnally conﬁrmed
by electromagnetic numerical calculations.

to 50 µm), shape (l/r = 0 to l/r = 5) and thickness (be-
tween 0.4 µm and 0.7 µm to avoid vertical multimode be-
havior) with quality factor Q greater than 6000 [10]. The
microlasers are pumped uniformly from above at 532 nm
with a frequency doubled picosecond Nd:YAG laser and
emit from their sides with λ
600 nm. Such 2D dielec-
tric billiards present an eﬀective refractive index n of 1.5
and are operating in the semi-classical regime (r/λ vary-
ing from typically 20 up to 100). The emitted light is
collected in the far-ﬁeld and coupled to a multi-channel
detector via a spectrometer. A typical experimental spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 2 (bottom). The sample is ﬁxed
on a rotating mount and the intensity emitted in a given
direction is obtained by summing over all pixels of the
spectrum. Far-ﬁeld spectra are performed over 360◦ by
5◦ steps with the aperture angle of about 15◦.

dium shape. The direction of maximal emission depends
on the l/r form ratio. Experimental results are summa-
rized in Fig. 3 for form ratios ranging from l/r = 0.5 to
l/r = 3. They represent an optimum for reproducibility
according to our 5◦ precision interval.

Even if stadium-shaped billiards are fully chaotic sys-
tems, these micro-lasers present experimentally a highly
directional emission in the far-ﬁeld pattern. The direc-
tion of maximal emission depends on the l/r form ratio
and a variation of more than 30◦ has been measured be-
tween l/r = 0.5 and l/r = 3 (Fig. 3)what can be of great
interest for applications in integrated optics.

To account for these experimental results, we ﬁrst per-

critical angle, χc = arcsin(1/n), thus allowing the ray

the background, only those rays which propagate over
more than a ﬁnite threshold distance (twice the billiard
perimeter in Fig. 4) are taken into account. Histograms
are indented by peaks which reveal the structure of un-
derlying unstable manifolds [12, 13]. An histogram is
calculated for each form ratio value and the position of
its maximum is plotted versus l/r in Fig. 3 (solid lines).
The plot is in excellent agreement with real experimental

results as seen from Fig. 3.

For some l/r values ray simulations reveal the exis-
tence of a few peaks with comparable amplitudes (cf.
Fig. 4). Dotted line branch in Fig. 3 indicates the
most prominent satellite peak. Nevertheless dominant
experiment contribution is assumed to correspond to the
upper branch because its associated intensity (integral
below the peak) is larger than the other one (cf. solid
line curve in Fig. 4).

To explain main features of experiments and ray sim-
ulations, we develop a simple model based on geometri-
cal optics. To minimize refraction loss, rays propagating
near the boundary are privileged. So we focus on rays
which, after being totally reﬂected on the left half-circle,
come to bounce on the right one (see Fig. 1). Long-lived
trajectories can be characterized by their density on the
Poincar´e surface of section with coordinates s and sin χ.
Our main assumption is that this density is uniform in
the allowed part of phase-space

where Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function.

Long-lived trajectories in open chaotic systems are
concentrated near unstable manifolds of conﬁned peri-
odic orbits [6, 12]. So the true density is a fractal whose
correct determination requires the knowledge of large
number of periodic orbits. However, ﬁnite experimen-
tal resolution and quantum eﬀects will smooth out small
details and as the ﬁrst approximation the assumption (1)
looks quite natural. Below we show that it leads to sim-
ple analytical formulas in a good agreement with direct
ray simulations.

Let us consider point sources on the left half-circle
emitting light according to (1). Among these, some rays
escape by refraction on the right half-circle and one can
deduce the histogram of outgoing angles. The depen-
dence of the histogram maximum on l/r reproduces well
experiments and ray simulations, validating the assump-
tions. As the resulting curves are closed to lens model
predictions (see below) we did not present them.

To further simplify this approach, we consider the right
half-circle as an ideal lens. In this approximation all rays
emitted from a point source are focused exactly as rays
close to the line connecting the source and the center
of the right half-circle (i.e. spherical aberrations are ig-
nored). So the direction of emission θ corresponds mainly
to this line and can be calculated analytically from purely
geometrical considerations. It depends on the emission
angle χ and on the number
of rebounds on straight

Within the lens model the emission intensity is propor-

but they are visible in ray simulations (cf. a small peak
around 30◦ in the histogram for l/r = 2.5 in Fig. 4).
The directional emission predictions for channels with
m = 0 and m =
1 are indicated by dashed lines in
Fig. 3. The excellent agreement between these curves,
experiments and direct ray simulations conﬁrms that the
assumption (1) is relevant to interpret analytically the
emission of the stadium-shaped cavity in the geometrical
optics domain.

So good agreement between geometrical and wave op-
tics does not usually appear for closed chaotic systems.
The emission directions of these quantum dielectric bil-
liards behave largely as if they were classical ones, gov-
erned by geometrical optics rules. However there is no
loss of coherence as in open systems generally studied in
the ﬁeld of decoherence [4]: experimental spectra present
clear peaks (see ﬁg. 2 (bottom)) and no noise is intro-
duced to couple light with the outside of the cavity. Ac-
tually the typical distance L/r covered by a photon -

our experiments. This magnitude suggests that inter-
ference eﬀects should be taken into account whereas we
have demonstrated that a geometrical optics approach is
suﬃcient to predict the overall directional emission. The
lens model shows that it is mostly connected with the
existence of only a small number of well deﬁned open
emission channels. Under higher precision calculations
and experiments, each channel should split into many
narrow peaks and quantum phenomena should be more
important.

In summary, we present experimental results about
directional emission of stadium-shaped micro-lasers and
demonstrate that they are well described by simple ge-

ometrical optics approaches. We develop a lens model
which predicts analytically main features of directional
emission. Moreover we point out that well-conﬁned wave-
functions show a good agreement with these classical pre-
dictions while coherent properties are not destroyed.

These kinds of predictions seem to be applicable to a
more general class of chaotic dielectric billiards. Experi-
ments and calculations are thus under progress to explore
other micro-cavity shapes like cut disk and cardioid.

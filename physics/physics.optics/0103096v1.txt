Abstract

There are many two-by-two matrices in layer optics. It is shown that they can
be formulated in terms of a three-parameter group whose algebraic property is
the same as the group of Lorentz transformations in a space with two space-
like and one time-like dimensions, or the Sp(2) group which is a standard
theoretical tool in optics. Among the interesting mathematical properties
of this group, the Iwasawa decomposition drastically simpliﬁes the matrix

I. INTRODUCTION

In a series of recent papers [1,2], Han , Kim and Noz have formulated polarization optics
in terms of the two-by-two and four-by-four representations of the six-parameter Lorentz
group. They noted that the Lorentz group properties can be found in optical materials.
Indeed, there are many two-by-two matrices in layer optics [3–5]. In this paper, we reorganize
them within the framework of the Lorentz group. We then derive a mathematical relation
which can be tested experimentally. If a light wave hits a ﬂat surface, a part of this beam
becomes reﬂected and the remaining part becomes transmitted.

If there are multi-layers, this process repeats itself at each boundary. There has been
a systematic approach to this problem based on the two-by-two S-matrix formalism [3–5].
This S-matrix consists of boundary and phase-shift matrices. The phase-shift matrices are
complex and the S-matrix is in general complex.

However, in this paper, we show ﬁrst these complex matrices can be systematically
transformed into a set of real traceless matrices with three independent parameters. Then
we can use the well-established mathematical procedure for them. This procedure is called
the Sp(2) group whose algebraic property is the same as that of the SU(1, 1) group which
occupies a prominent place in optics from squeezed states of light [6]. However, the most
pleasant aspect of the Sp(2) group is that its algebras consist only of two-by-two matrices
with real elements. When applied to a two-dimensional plane, they produce rotations and
squeeze transformations [7].

It is known that these simple matrices produce some non-trivial mathematical results,
namely Wigner rotations and Iwasawa decompositions [8]. The Wigner rotation means a
rotation resulting from a multiplication of three squeeze matrices, and the Iwasawa decom-
position means that a product of squeeze and rotation matrices, under certain conditions,
leads to a matrix with one vanishing oﬀ-diagonal elements. This leads to a substantial sim-
pliﬁcation in mathematics and eventually leads to a more transparent comparison of theory
with experiments. This decomposition has been discussed in the literature in connection
with polarization optics [9,10]. In this paper, we study applications of this mathematical
device in layer optics.

There are papers in the literature on applications of the Lorentz group in layer op-
tics [2,11], but these papers are concerned with polarization optics. In this paper, we are
dealing with reﬂections and transmissions of optical rays. We show that layers with alter-
nate indexes of refraction can exhibit an Iwasawa eﬀect and provide a calculation of the
transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients. It is remarkable that the Lorentz group can play as
the fundamental scientiﬁc language even in the physics of reﬂections and transmissions.

In Sec. II, we formulate the problem in terms of the S-matrix method widely used in
optics [3]. In Sec. III, this S-matrix formalism is translated into the mathematical framework
of the Sp(2) group consisting of two-by-two traceless matrices with real elements. We
demonstrate that there is a subset of these matrices with one vanishing non-diagonal element.
It is shown possible to produce this set of matrices from multiplications of the matrices in
the original set. This is called the Iwasawa decomposition. In Sec. IV, we transform the
mathematical formalism of the Iwasawa decomposition into the real world, and calculate
the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients which can be measured in optics laboratories.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

Let us start with the S-matrix formalism of the layer optics. If a beam is incident on
a plane boundary of a medium with a diﬀerent index of refraction, the problem can be
formulated in terms of two-by-two matrices [3,5]. If we write the column vectors

for the incident, with superscript (+), and reﬂected, with superscript (-), for the beams in
the ﬁrst and second media respectively, then they are connected by the two-by-two S-matrix:

E(+)
1
E(−)
1 !

E(−)

.

Of course the elements of the above S-matrix depend on reﬂection and transmission coeﬃ-
cients [3].

FIG. 1. Multi-layer system. A light beam is incident on the ﬁrst boundary, with transmitted
and reﬂected rays. The transmitted ray goes through the ﬁrst medium and hits the second medium
again with reﬂected and transmitted rays. The transmitted ray goes through the second medium
and hits the ﬁrst medium. This cycle continues N times.

Let us consider a light wave incident on a ﬂat surface, then it is decomposed into trans-

mitted and reﬂected rays. If E(+)

is the incident ray, the transmitted ray is E(+)

Thus, the S-matrix takes the form [3]

If the ray comes from the second medium in the opposite direction, the same matrix can be
used for

Since the magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient is smaller than one, and since t2
we can write the above matrix as

r12 = tanh η,

t12 = 1/ cosh η.

Since this describes both the reﬂection and transmission at the boundary, shall call this
matrix “boundary matrix” [12]. It is a uni-modular matrix (determinant = 1). The math-

squeeze transformations when applied to the two-dimensional space of x and y [7].

where the subscripts a and b are for the initial and ﬁnal surfaces respectively. The above
expression tells there is a phase diﬀerence of 2δ between the rays. This phase diﬀerence
depends on the index of refraction, wavelength and the angle of incidence [3].

In this paper, we consider a multi-layer system consisting of two media with diﬀerent
indexes of refraction as is illustrated in Fig. 1. Then, the system consists of many boundaries
and phase-shift matrices. After multiplication of all those matrices, the result will be one
two-by-two matrix which we introduced as the S-matrix in Eq.(2). We are interested in this
paper when this matrix takes special forms which can be readily tested experimentally.

If the ray hits the ﬁrst medium from the air, as is illustrated in Fig 1, we write the matrix

as

We realize that the numerical computation of this expression is rather trivial these days, but
we are still interested in the mathematical form which takes exceptionally simple form. It is
still an interesting problem to produce mathematics which enables us to perform calculations
without using computers. In Sec. III, we shall consider mathematical simpliﬁcation coming
from one vanishing oﬀ-diagonal element.

The Lorentz group allows us to simplify this expression under certain conditions.

For this purpose, we transform the above expression into a more convenient form, by

taking the conjugate of each of the matrices with

C1 =

In this way, we have converted W of Eq.(19) into a real matrix, but it is not simple enough.

After multiplication, the matrix of Eq.(23) will take the form

V =

A B
C D (cid:19)
where A, B, C, and D are real numbers. If B and C vanish, this matrix will become diagonal,
and the problem will become too simple.
If, on the other hand, only one of these two
elements become zero, we will achieve a substantial mathematical simpliﬁcation and will be
encouraged to look for physical circumstances which will lead to this simpliﬁcation.

(26)

(cid:18)

,

Let us summarize. we started in this section with the matrix representation W given in
Eq.(19). This form can be transformed into the V matrix of Eq.(23) through the conjugate
transformation

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

where C is given in Eq.(24). Conversely, we can recover the W representation by

V = CW C −1,

W = C −1V C.

For calculational purposes, the V representation is much easier because we are dealing with
real numbers. On the other hand, the W representation is of the form for the S-matrix we
intend to compute. It is gratifying to see that they are equivalent.

Let us go back to Eq.(23) and consider the case where the angles φ and ξ satisfy the

following constraints.

thus

φ + ξ = 2θ,

φ

ξ = π/2,

−

φ = θ + π/4,

ξ = θ

−

Then in terms of θ, we can reduce the matrix of Eq.(23) to the form

(cosh η) cos(2θ)
sinh η + (cosh η) sin(2θ)

sinh η

(cosh η) sin(2θ)

−

(cosh η) cos(2θ)

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

Thus the matrix takes a surprisingly simple form if the parameters θ and η satisfy the
constraint

Then the matrix becomes

sinh η = (cosh η) sin(2θ).

This aspect of the Lorentz group is known as the Iwasawa decomposition [8], and has been
discussed in the optics literature [9,10].

The matrices of the form is not so strange in optics.

The question then is whether it is possible to construct optical layers which will perform
this or similar calculation. In order to make contacts with the real world, let us extend the
algebra to the form

The above expression depends only the number of layer cycles N and the parameter η,
which was deﬁned in terms of the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients in Eq.(7). It is
important also that the above simple form is possible only if the phase-shift parameters φ
and ξ should satisfy the relations given in Eq.(30) and Eq.(32). In summary, they should
satisfy

cos(2ξ) =

cos(2φ),

and

tanh η = cos(2ξ).

(48)

−

In setting up the experiment, we note that all three parameters η, ξ and η depend on the
incident angle and the frequency of the light wave. The parameter η is derivable from the
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients which depend on both the angle and frequency. The
angular parameters ξ and φ depend on the optical path and the index of refraction which
depend on the incident angle and the frequency respectively.

Now all three quantities in Eq.(48) are functions of the incident angle and the frequency.
If we consider a three-dimensional space with the incident angle and frequency as the x and
y axes respectively. All three quantities, cos(2ξ), cos(2φ), and tanh η, will be represented by
two-dimensional surfaces. If we choose cos(2ξ) and cos(2φ), the intersection will be a line.
This line will pass through the third surface for tanh η. The point at which the line passes
through the surface corresponds to the values of the incident angle and frequency which will
satisfy the two conditions given in Eq.(48).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we borrowed the concept of Iwasawa decomposition from well-known the-
orems in group theory. On the other hand, group theory appears in this paper in the form
of two-by-two matrices with three independent parameters. The Iwasawa decomposition
makes the algebra of two-by-two matrices even simpler. It is interesting to note that there
still is a room for mathematical simpliﬁcations in the algebra of two-by-two matrices and
that this procedure can be tested in optics laboratories.

Abstract

In conventional approaches to the homogenization of random particulate composites, both
the distribution and size of the component phase particles are often inadequately taken into
account. Commonly, the spatial distributions are characterized by volume fraction alone,
while the electromagnetic response of each component particle is represented as a vanishingly
small depolarization volume. The strong-permittivity-ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) provides
an alternative approach to homogenization wherein a comprehensive description of distri-
butional statistics of the component phases is accommodated. The bilocally-approximated
SPFT is presented here for the anisotropic homogenized composite which arises from com-
ponent phases comprising ellipsoidal particles. The distribution of the component phases is
characterized by a two-point correlation function and its associated correlation length. Each
component phase particle is represented as an ellipsoidal depolarization region of nonzero
volume. The eﬀects of depolarization volume and correlation length are investigated through
considering representative numerical examples. It is demonstrated that both the spatial ex-
tent of the component phase particles and their spatial distributions are important factors
in estimating coherent scattering losses of the macroscopic ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Consider the propagation of electromagnetic radiation through a composite medium com-
prising a random distribution of particles. Provided wavelengths are suﬃciently long com-
pared with the dimensions of the component particles, the composite may be regarded as
an eﬀectively homogenous medium. The estimation of the constitutive parameters of such a
homogenized composite medium (HCM) is a matter of long-standing scientiﬁc and technolog-
ical importance [1, 2]. Furthermore, recent advances relating to HCM-based metamaterials
have promoted interest in this area and highlighted the necessity for accurate formalisms to
estimate the constitutive parameters of complex HCMs [3].

The microstructural details of the component phases are often inadequately incorporated
in homogenization formalisms. In particular, conventional approaches to homogenization,
as exempliﬁed by the widely-applied Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms, gener-
ally involve simplistic treatments of the distributional statistics and sizes of the compo-
nent phase particles [4]. It is noteworthy that both the Maxwell–Garnett and Bruggeman
formalisms arise in the long–wavelength regime. The long–wavelength derivation of the
Maxwell–Garnett formalism follows a from rigorous treatment of the singularity of the free–
space dyadic Green function [5, 6]. The Bruggeman formalism emerges from the strong-
permittivity-ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) under the long–wavelength approximation [7, 8].

The SPFT provides an alternative approach to homogenization in which a comprehensive de-
scription of the distributional statistics of the component phases is accommodated. Though
the SPFT was originally developed for wave propagation in continuous random mediums
[7, 8, 9, 10], it has more recently gained prominence in the homogenization of particulate
composites [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Within the SPFT, estimates of the HCM constitutive param-
eters are calculated as successive reﬁnements to the constitutive parameters of a homogenous
comparison medium. Iterates are expressed in terms of correlation functions describing the
spatial distribution of the component phases. Correlation functions of arbitrarily high order
may be incorporated in principle, but the SPFT is usually implemented at the second order
level, known as the bilocal approximation. A two-point correlation function and its associ-
ated correlation length characterize the component phase distributions for the second order
SPFT. At lowest order (i.e., zeroth and ﬁrst order), the SPFT estimate of HCM permittivity
is identical to that of the Bruggeman homogenization formalism [2].

Depolarization dyadics are key ingredients in homogenization analyses as they character-
ize the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside inclusions (i.e., component phase particles) embedded
within a homogenous background. Commonly, the inclusion particles are treated as vanish-
ingly small point-like entities; under this approximation, the corresponding depolarization
dyadic is represented by the singularity of the associated dyadic Green function [16, 17].
Through neglecting the spatial extent of the inclusions, potentially important information
is lost, particularly when coherent scattering losses are to be considered [18, 19]. It is noted
that extended versions of both the Maxwell Garnett formalism [20, 21] and the Bruggeman
formalism [20, 22] have been developed in which a nonzero volume is attributed to the com-

2

ponent phase particles. However, these analyses apply only to isotropic HCMs and adopt a
simplistic description of the distributional statistics of the component phases.

In the present study, the SPFT is presented for an anisotropic dielectric HCM. The analysis
takes place within the frequency–domain, wherein dissipation is signalled by constitutive
parameters having nonzero imaginary parts. The component phases are taken to consist of
randomly distributed, ellipsoidal particles of nonzero volume. In Section 2, the depolarization
dyadic appropriate to an ellipsoidal inclusion of linear dimensions proportional to the size
parameter η > 0, embedded within an anisotropic comparison medium, is developed. Details
of the SPFT-based homogenization are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the theoretical
results are illustrated by representative numerical examples relating to both nondissipative
and dissipative component phases. In particular, nondissipative component phases giving
rise to dissipative HCMs — through radiative scattering loss from the macroscopic coherent
ﬁeld [23] — is highlighted. A few concluding remarks are provided in Section 5.

2 Depolarization

Let us consider an ellipsoidal inclusion of volume V η
along the Cartesian x, y, z axes. The ellipsoidal surface of V η

e , orientated with its principal axes lying
e is parameterized by

r e(θ, φ) = η U • ˆr (θ, φ),

(1)

where ˆr (θ, φ) is the radial unit vector speciﬁed by the spherical polar coordinates θ and φ.
The diagonal shape dyadic

maps the spherical region V η of radius η onto the ellipsoidal region V η
e . The linear dimensions
of the ellipsoidal inclusion, as determined by η, are assumed to be suﬃciently small that the
electromagnetic long-wavelength regime pertains, but not vanishingly small.

Suppose the ellipsoidal inclusion is embedded within a homogenous comparison medium. In
consonance with the shape dyadic (2), the comparison medium is taken as an anisotropic
dielectric medium characterized by the diagonal permittivity dyadic ǫ
with principal axes

practice to neglect Dη and assume that the depolarization dyadic is given by D0 alone [2].
However, studies of isotropic HCMs have emphasized the importance of the nonzero spatial
extent of depolarization regions [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

The properties of depolarization dyadics associated with vanishingly small inclusions have
been widely investigated: the volume integral (10) simpliﬁes to the η–independent surface

Furthermore, the integrations of (13) reduce to elliptic function representations [25]. In the
case of spheroidal inclusion geometries, hyperbolic functions provide an evaluation of D0 [16],
while for the degenerate isotropic case Ux = Uy = Uz the well-known result D0 = (1/3iω) ǫ−1

emerges [26].

We focus attention on Dη. By analogy with an equivalent integration which arises within
the strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory [27], the application of residue calculus to (9)
provides

3 Homogenization

The SPFT may be applied to estimate the constitutive parameters of HCMs. Let us consider
the homogenization of a two–phase composite wherein the two component phases, labelled as
a and b, comprise ellipsoidal particles of shape speciﬁed by U and linear dimensions speciﬁed
by η > 0. A random distribution of identically orientated particles is envisaged. The
component phases a and b are taken to be isotropic dielectric mediums with permittivities
ǫa and ǫb, respectively.

The distributional statistics of the component phases are described in terms of moments of
the characteristic functions

The volume fraction of phase ℓ, namely fℓ , is given by the ﬁrst statistical moment of Φℓ ;

i.e.,
two-point covariance function. We adopt the physically-motivated form [29]

The nth order SPFT estimate of the HCM permittivity, namely ǫ[n]
, is based upon the

iterative reﬁnement of the comparison medium permittivity, namely ǫ
. To zeroth order
and ﬁrst order, the SPFT permittivity estimate is identical to the comparison medium
permittivity [2]; i.e.,

4 Numerical studies

We investigate the theoretical results presented in Sections 2 and 3 by means of represen-
tative numerical studies. To highlight the particular eﬀects of depolarization volume and
correlation length, it is expedient to begin with a study of HCMs arising from nondissipa-
R) before proceeding to consider HCMs arising from
tive component mediums (i.e., ǫa,b ∈
C with Im (ǫa,b) > 0). However, we note that
dissipative component mediums (i.e., ǫa,b ∈
caution should be exercised when applying the SPFT and Bruggeman formalism to weakly
dissipative HCMs where Re (ǫa) and Re (ǫb) have opposite signs [31]. For all calculations
reported here, the angular frequency ω is ﬁxed at 2π

1010 rad s

4.1 Nondissipative component phases

Consider, for example, the HCM which arises from the nondissipative component phases
speciﬁed by the permittivities and shape parameters

ǫa = 2ǫ0,
Ux = 1, Uy = 3,

ǫb = 12ǫ0

Uz = 15 (cid:27)

In Figure 1, the components of the zeroth order SPFT estimate of HCM permittivity
ǫ[0]
ab0) are plotted against volume fraction fa and relative inclusion
ab
size k0η. The permittivity parameters ǫx,y,z
ab0 are constrained to agree with ǫb and ǫa at fa = 0
(0, 1), the ellipsoidal particulate ge-
and fa = 1, respectively. For volume fractions fa ∈
ometry of the component phases endows the HCM with biaxial anisotropy and we observe
that ǫx
ab0, ǫz
ab0, ǫa and ǫb each take diﬀerent values. At η = 0 the estimates of the HCM
permittivity parameters ǫx,y,z
ab0 are the same as those of the conventional Bruggeman homoge-
nization formalism. When η > 0 the parameters ǫx,y,z
ab0 become complex-valued with positive
imaginary parts, despite the component phase permittivities ǫa and ǫb being real-valued.
The manifestation of Im (ǫx,y,z
ab0 ) > 0 indicates radiative scattering loss from the macroscopic
coherent ﬁeld [23]. Thus, we see that by attributing a nonzero volume to the component
phase inclusions, coherent scattering is accommodated, thereby giving rise to a dissipative
HCM. Since the imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z
ab0 are observed to increase with increasing η, it is
deduced that more radiation is scattered out of the coherent ﬁeld by enlarging the depolar-
ization volumes. The real parts of the HCM permittivity parameters ǫx,y,z
ab0 are found to be
relatively insensitive to the inclusion size parameter η.

Let us turn now to the bilocally-approximated SPFT. For vanishingly small component
phase inclusions (i.e., η = 0), the components of the second order SPFT estimate of HCM
permittivity ǫ[2]
ab2) are graphed against volume fraction fa and relative
ab
correlation length k0L in Figure 2. As L
0, the second order SPFT estimates converge
to those of the zeroth order SPFT. Accordingly, the estimates of the HCM permittivity
parameters ǫx,y,z
ab2 at L = 0 are the same as the estimates deriving from the conventional

= ǫ0 diag (ǫx

ab2, ǫy

ab2, ǫz

→

Bruggeman homogenization formalism. As the correlation length L increases from 0, the
HCM parameters ǫx,y,z
ab2 acquire positive-valued imaginary parts. Furthermore, as L increases
so the imaginary parts of the HCM parameters ǫx,y,z
ab2 become increasingly large. Thus, we
infer that the scattering interactions of increasing numbers of component phase inclusions
become correlated as L increases, resulting in an increasingly dissipative HCM. The real parts
of the HCM permittivity parameters ǫx,y,z
ab2 do not vary signiﬁcantly as the correlation length
increases, as is illustrated in Figure 2. Notice that the relationship between the correlation
length L and the second order SPFT parameters ǫx,y,z
for η = 0 closely resembles the
ab2
relationship between the inclusion size parameter η and the zeroth order SPFT parameters
ǫx,y,z
ab0 presented in Figure 1.

The result of combining an inclusion size parameter η > 0 with a correlation length L > 0 is
presented in Figure 3. Therein, the components of the second order SPFT estimate ǫ[2]
are
ab
plotted against both relative correlation length k0L and the relative inclusion size η/L for
the ﬁxed volume fraction fa = 0.3. The real and imaginary parts of the HCM permittivity
parameters ǫx,y,z
ab2 are seen to increase with both η and L. Furthermore, the rate of increase of
Im (ǫx,y,z
ab2 ) exceeds the corresponding rate of increase observed in Figure 1 when L = 0, and
in Figure 2 when η = 0. Hence, by taking account of both nonzero depolarization volume
and correlation length, more radiation is scattered out of the coherent ﬁeld than would be
the case if either nonzero depolarization volume or correlation length alone was taken into
account.

4.2 Dissipative component phases

While it is instructive to consider nondissipative component phases in order to highlight
the particular eﬀects of depolarization volume and correlation length, in reality all mediums
exhibit dissipation. Therefore, let us now consider the homogenization of component phases
characterized by the complex-valued permittivities ǫa = (2 + 0.05i) ǫ0 and ǫb = (12 + 0.4i) ǫ0.
We continue with the same values for the inclusion shape parameters Ux, Uy and Uz as given
in (31). The volume fraction is ﬁxed at fa = 0.3 for all results presented in this section.

In Figure 4, the components of the zeroth order SPFT estimate of HCM permittivity ǫ[0]
ab
are plotted against relative inclusion size k0η. Since the component phases are themselves
dissipative, the imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z
ab0 are positive-valued at η = 0. As the inclusion size
ab0 also increase. The growth in Im (ǫx,y,z
parameter η increases, so the imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z
ab0 )
is attributable to the increasing amount of coherent scattering loss which develops as the
depolarization regions increase in size. As was observed in the corresponding instance for
nondissipative component phases, the real parts of ǫx,y,z
The second order SPFT estimates of the HCM permittivity parameters ǫx,y,z
ab2 , calculated with
η = 0, are graphed against relative correlation length k0L in Figure 5. The observed increase
in Im (ǫx,y,z
ab0 ) as L increases reﬂects the fact that coherent losses increase as the actions of
increasing numbers of scattering centres become correlated. The real parts of the HCM

ab0 are relatively insensitive to η.

9

permittivity parameters vary little as the correlation length increases. Comparing Figures 4
and 5, it is clear that the dependency upon L for the second-order SPFT with η = 0 closely
resembles the dependency upon η for the zeroth order SPFT.

Finally, let us consider the combined eﬀect of nonzero depolarization volume and correlation
length. In Figure 6, ǫx,y,z
ab2 are plotted against relative inclusion size k0η for the ﬁxed relative
correlation length k0L = 0.1. While Re (ǫx,y,z
ab2 ) are relatively insensitive to increasing η,
Im (ǫx,y,z
ab2 ) increase markedly as the inclusion size parameter increases. Furthermore, the rate
of increase of Im (ǫx,y,z
ab2 ) in Figure 6 is greater than that seen in Figure 4 where the inﬂuence
of η alone is considered, and in Figure 5 where the inﬂuence of L alone is considered.

5 Concluding remarks

In implementations of homogenization formalisms, such as the widely-used Maxwell Garnett
and Bruggeman formalisms, the distributional statistics and sizes of the component phase
particles are often inadequately taken into account. A notable exception is provided by the
SPFT in which the distributional statistics of the component phases are described through a
hierarchy of spatial correlation functions. In the present study the SPFT is extended through
attributing a nonzero volume to the component phase inclusions. Thereby, we show that
both depolarization volume and correlation length contribute to coherent scattering losses.
Furthermore, the eﬀects of depolarization volume and correlation length upon the imagi-
nary parts of the HCM constitutive parameters are cumulative and reﬂect the anisotropy
of the HCM. We remark that our numerical results which relate to the eﬀect of depolar-
ization volume alone, as presented in presented in Figures 1 and 4, are consistent with
numerical results based on the extended Maxwell Garnett and extended Bruggeman homog-
enization formalisms for isotropic dielectric HCMs [20, 32]. The importance of incorporating
microstructural details within homogenization formalisms is thus further emphasized.

Abstract

We study the dynamics of the reduced density matrix(RDM) of
the ﬁeld in the micromaser. The resonator is pumped by N -atomic
clusters of two-level atoms. At each given instant there is only one
cluster in the cavity. We ﬁnd the conditions of the independent evo-
lution of the matrix elements of RDM belonging to a (sub)diagonal
of the RDM, i.e. conditions of the diagonal invariance for the case
of pumping by N -atomic clusters. We analyze the spectrum of the
evolution operator of the RDM and discover the existence of the qu-
asitrapped states of the ﬁeld mode. These states exist for a wide
range of number of atoms in the cluster as well as for a broad range
of relaxation rates. We discuss the hierarchy of dynamical processes
in the micromaser and ﬁnd an important property of the ﬁeld states
corresponding to the quasi-equilibrium: these states are close to either
Fock states or to a superposition of the Fock states. A possibility to
tune the distribution function of photon numbers is discussed.

Recent developments in the cavity electrodynamics [1] gave rise to the cre-
ation of a real physical device - micromaser which operates on highly excited
Rydberg atoms pumped through a high-Q resonator [2]. Existing literature
mostly focuses on the ideal (basic) model which is the so-called one-atom
micromaser [3, 4, 5, 6]. This device is assumed to operate in such a way
that no more than one atom excited with the probability 1 can be found
in the cavity at each given instant of time. The basic model is justiﬁed by
the following assumptions: the average velocity of injection R , and the time
of interaction τ (in which a cluster passes through the resonator) are small.
The rate of relaxation γ of the ﬁeld is low, which means a high-Q resonator.
The coupling constant g of the ﬁeld mode interacting with internal degrees
of freedom of the atom is suﬃciently large. Trajectories are assumed to be
quasiclassical. In more exact terms these assumptions can be recapitulated
as

Rτ ≪ 1, τ γ ≪ 1, gτ ≥ 1

(1)

[9].

The micromaser operating on a periodic sequence of N-atomic clusters which
are created by laser pulses in the gas of unexcited atoms is introduced in [7].
It is assumed that the size of the cluster is much less than the wavelength
of the microwave radiation. Eﬀects of ﬁnite cluster size [8] are comparable
in magnitude with eﬀects of inhomogeneous ﬁeld at the edges of resonator.
The latter observation was reported in Ref.
In this Letter we study
the one-cluster extension of the basic model. This means that we assume
a point-like structure of N-atomic cluster (i.e.
the ﬁnite size eﬀects are
not taken into account) as well as the fulﬁllment of the conditions Eq.(1).
This formulation generalizes greatly the basic model while leaves intact the
simplifying assumption that process of interaction of the cluster and the ﬁeld
(within the time interval τ ) and the process of the ﬁeld relaxation to the
thermodynamic equilibrium (time interval T ∼ 1/R) are separated in time.
This latter assumption allows to factorize the evolution operator of the RDM
(see Eq. (3) below) and greatly simpliﬁes the analysis of the properties of
evolution operator and the dynamics of RDM.
One-cluster model of the micromaser assumes that the N-particle Tavis-
Cummings Hamiltonian [10]

H = H0 + V = ω (cid:18)a†a + S3 +

N

2 (cid:19) + 2g(cid:16)a†S− + aS+(cid:17)

(2)

is applicable. Here ω is the frequency of the quantum transition which is
in exact resonance with the ﬁeld mode. The collective spin variables S3, S±
are the generators of the su(2) algebra, while a†, a are the creation and
annihilation operator of the ﬁeld mode, ¯h = 1.
The operation of the micromaser for each cluster is divided into two time
intervals: the interaction time τ and the relaxation time T . This means that
the vector of the main diagonal ρ(l) of RDM satisﬁes the following equation

ρ(l+1)

= S(N)ρ(l) = Q(Nex)Spat (cid:16)e−iHτ ρat ⊗ ρ(l)eiHτ(cid:17)
= Q(Nex)W (τ )ρ(l).

(3)

This diﬀerence equation connects the main diagonals of RDM taken at the
instants when the l-th and (l + 1)-th clusters enter the cavity. This allows
to understand the number of passing clusters l as a discrete ”time variable”.
Here Nex = R/γ, and Q(Nex) is the evolution operator of RDM at the relax-
ation stage, i.e. in the empty resonator [5]. The operator W (τ ) describes the
evolution of RDM at the stage of interaction of (l+1)-th cluster with the ﬁeld,
ρat is the density matrix of N-atomic cluster before it enters the resonator.
The operation Spat means the trace with respect to atomic variables.
In our work we consider clusters of fully excited atoms, while the ﬁeld is ini-
tially prepared in the state of the thermal equilibrium with the mean number
of photons nb = 0.1. In our forthcoming publication we will rigorously show
that if there is an additive with respect to atoms and ﬁeld integral of mo-
tion [H, H0] = 0 and for unpolarized initial state of the cluster, then the
dynamics of RDM is diagonally invariant. This important property of the
evolution operator W (τ ) means that each (sub)diagonal of RDM in the Fock
basis evolves independently of other elements of RD matrix. In this Letter
we concentrate on the dynamics of the main diagonal of RDM, i.e. on the
number of photons probability distribution function. In the space of vectors
with components ρ(l)
n , the evolution operators Q(Nex) can be represented as
the following matrix

Q(Nex) = (cid:18)1 +

−1

L

Nex(cid:19)

,

(4)

where the operator L in the matrix form reads

2

Lnm = [−(nb + 1)nb(n + 1)]δnm − (nb + 1)(n + 1)δn+1,m + nbnδn−1,m.

(5)

The matrix of the evolution operator W (τ ) in the Fock basis is low-triangular.
In the present Letter we analyze this matrix by numerical methods. The
property of diagonal invariance simpliﬁes greatly the analysis of RDM dy-
namics.
The vector of the main diagonal of RDM satisﬁes the following diﬀerence
equation

(6)
Here J (l) is the vector of the probability ﬂux for the l-th passage. The
components of this vector are

ρ(l+1)

n = J (l+1)

− J (l)
n .

(7)

This vector determines the rate of change (after one passage) of the sum of
probabilities of the photon numbers in the interval of Fock numbers between
n = n0 and n = n1 . This rate is equal to the diﬀerence of ﬂuxes through
the chosen boundary values, viz

Xn=n0 (cid:16)ρ(l+1)

n − ρ(l)

n (cid:17) = J (l)

The dependencies of the eigenvalues Wn on the number of photons are given
in Figure 1 for the number of atoms in the cluster N=1,5,10. The interaction
time is chosen as gτ = 1.355 . The eigenvalues Wn are positive and do not
exceed 1. Their mutual positions are deﬁned by the parameter τ and the
number of atoms N. For the one-atom micromaser the so-called trapped
states are known. These are the Fock states for the number of photons n
corresponding to the eigenvalue Wn = 1 of the matrix W (τ ) . This number
of photons fulﬁlls the trapping condition
√n + 1 =

(9)

πχ
gτ

where χ is an integer number. The trapped states do not decay in the absence
of relaxation, and thus determine the dynamics of ρ(l) for large l. The recent

3

experimental realization of the trapped states was reported in [11]. The
Figure 1 shows that in the multi-atomic case there are no trapped states.
There are however a few eigenvalues which are close to 1. The corresponding
eigenvectors in the space of the number of photons are localized around the
numbers n for which Wn ≈ 1. Such long-living vectors is natural to call
quasitrapped states.
The Figure 2 shows the spectrum S(N) in ascending order. It is interesting
to notice that the eigenvalues of the evolution operator tend to group around
zero when the number of atoms in the cluster increases. In the hierarchy of
dynamical processes in the micromaser the small eigenvalues are responsi-
ble for the rapid phase of the dynamics (with respect to the discrete time l
). The quasitrapped states corresponding to the eigenvalues in the interval
[0.9, 1) are in turn responsible for the slow phase of dynamics. Probabilities
of the states with corresponding photon numbers at certain stages of the ﬁeld
formation can be rather high. In Figure 2 we compare the spectrum of the
evolution operator S(N) for the cases with (Nex = 20) and without relax-
ation. The Figure 2 shows in particular that for bigger N the spectrum of
S(N) is more stable towards the inﬂuence of relaxation. The relation Eq.(3)
describes the transition of the diagonal elements of RDM to a stationary
state. This transition process is determined by the pumping of the cavity
ﬁeld by passing clusters as well as by the relaxation of the ﬁeld. The re-
cent literature discusses mostly [3, 5] the properties of the stationary state,
which can be achieved when a large number of clusters has gone through the
cavity. This case corresponds to the asymptotic limit l → ∞ . In this work
we concentrate on the properties of the transition process which, due to the
existence of the quasitrapped states, are very interesting. The ﬁeld rather
rapidly ”forgets” its initial state of the thermal equilibrium. The dynamics
of the population of the Fock states shows instead the formation of long-
living (with respect to the ”time” l) quasi-equilibrium distributions. This is
illustrated by the properties of spectrum of the evolution operator given in
Figures 1,2. The existence of the eigenvalues close to 1 indicates consider-
able probabilities of the Fock states with photon numbers in the vicinities of
the maxima. The small eigenvalues correspond to the sharp depletion of the
corresponding Fock states. The Figure 1 shows that in the chosen interval
of Fock numbers, 0 ≤ n ≤ 60, and for gτ = 1.355 there are three domains
capturing considerable probabilities. These domains, which are natural to
call the domains of quasitrapping are localized in the vicinities of the Fock

4

numbers n = 5, 18, 40 and contain almost all the probabilities. This means
that they are getting populated at diﬀerent ”moments” of ”time” l in relays:
the next domain cannot get populated until the previous one is depleted.
This relay of populations is illustrated in Figures 3,4,5. The Figure 3 show
for N = 10 how the sums of probabilities of the Fock states change with l
in the second (14 ≤ n ≤ 24) and the third (39 ≤ n ≤ 49) domains of qu-
asitrapping. The rates of probability change are calculated through Eq. (8)
i.e. as the ﬂux diﬀerences through the boundaries of the chosen domains.
The Figure 3 allows to identify the following stages of the l-dynamics: a
period of accumulation of the probability which corresponds to the positive
values of the probability rate as well as an extended in time (l) period of
the negative probability rates. The lasting nature of the latter period indi-
cates that the life-time of the quasitrapped states is considerable. The rate
of decay of the second quasitrapped state (n ≈ 18) is approximately the rate
of accumulation in the third state (n ≈ 40). This means that through a
passage of a cluster the probability is almost fully relayed from the second
quasitrapped state to the third. Since the dynamics of the decay of the sec-
ond quasitrapped state is slow, so is the dynamics of the accumulation in the
third state. In Figures 4 and 5 are given dependencies on l of total popula-
tions curves of the domains of quasitrapping. It is evident from Figures 4 and
5 that the sum of populations of two subsequent domains of quasitrapping is
close to 1. This again manifests the full accumulation of the probabilities in
the domains of quasitrapping as well as the relay of probabilities indicated
above. The Figure 6 shows the distributions of the diagonal elements of the
RDM taken at the l -moments of maximal probabilities of the Fock states
in the corresponding domains of quasitrapping. As follows from Figure 6 it
is possible to govern the vector of photon number distribution. This can be
achieved by the variation of the number of atoms passed through the res-
onator. It is possible in particular to create states close to the Fock states
localized at certain photon numbers. We can also report that a domain of
the localization changes smoothly in accord with variations of parameters τ ,
N and Nex . The dependence of the stationary ﬁeld on these parameters for
N = 1 was discussed in Refs.
[3, 5, 6]. The possibility to engineer quantum
states is actively studied in the recent literature [12].

Conclusions and discussion

The main result of our work is the discovered possibility to purposefully
create in the cavity quasistable states close to Fock states. We analyzed
[7]. Our
the dynamics of the micromaser pumped by N-atomic clusters
approach generalizes the basic model of the one atom micromaser
[3] and
can be experimentally realized. We assumed the point-like nature of N-
atomic clusters. This assumption can easily be realized in practice when
clusters are created in a gas ﬂow by focused laser pulses in the light range.
In this case the width of the beam is of order of few microns while the
size of the cavity can be of order of few millimeters. In our work we have
pointed out the conditions when the time evolution of a (sub)diagonal of the
reduced density matrix is independent of the other elements of the density
matrix. We have investigated the properties of the spectrum of the evolution
operator (see Figures 1,2) and discussed their connection to the properties
of the RDM dynamics. We have discussed the hierarchy of the time scales of
the micromaser dynamics and have shown that the sectors of the spectrum
around zero are responsible for rapid processes while the sectors close to 1
correspond to quasi-equilibrium. For the ﬁrst time in the existing literature
we have introduced an important notion of the quasitrapped states. The
Figure 6 shows that these states are close to the Fock states. The domains
in the Fock space corresponding to quasitrapping are rather narrow, their
locations change smoothly with variations of the number of atoms in the
cluster. This means that the overall picture of the dynamics is stable with
respect to small variations of the number of atoms in a cluster. In our future
work we plan to investigate this phenomenon in a greater detail as well as to
study how the properties of the quasitrapped states depend on the choice of
the initial density matrix of the N-atomic cluster.

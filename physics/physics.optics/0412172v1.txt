Abstract

The collective and single-electron ampliﬁcation regimes of a non-collinear free electron laser
are analyzed within the framework of dispersion equations. The small-signal gain and the
conditions for self-ampliﬁed excitations are found. The collective excitations in a free electron
laser are shown to be favored by the non-collinear arrangement of the relativistic electrons
and the laser wave. Implications for free-electron lasing without inversion are discussed.

1 Introduction

In a free-electron laser (FEL) [1], [2], the accelerated motion of electrons in the ponder-
motive potential of the combined ﬁeld of the wiggler and the ampliﬁed electromagnetic
wave produces coherent stimulated radiation. The inﬂuence of the pondermotive potential
induces structuring of the spatial density of electrons (bunching) on the scale of the laser
wavelength. As a result net emission is enhanced. The electron beam in FELs is usu-
ally aligned along the ampliﬁed electromagnetic wave and the wiggler. The non-collinear
geometry of the electron beam and laser waves structures the spacial and momentum dis-
tributions of electrons in a way that gives rise to a new ampliﬁcation mechanism called
free-electron laser without inversion (FELWI) [3]-[8]. These FELs use the advanced phase
control to enhance the gain via interference of radiation produced in the two wigglers. To
extend the analysis of FELWIs from the single-electron (Thompson) regime to the collec-
tive (Raman) regime of electromagnetic excitation a detailed study should be made of the
ampliﬁcation in a single wiggler for a non-collinear arrangement of the electron beam and
the ampliﬁed wave. The goal of the current paper is to perform this analysis. Investigation
of the regimes and conditions for the ampliﬁcations in a non-collinear FEL geometry is
also interesting from academic point of view. This investigation generalizes the results of
the book [10] and allows one to obtain the applicability limits of a single-electron approach
used in papers [3]-[8]. It can have implications for other types of free-electron lasers as
well.

An FELWI is composed of two magnetic wigglers being spatially separated by a drift
region with magnetic ﬁeld. There is a small angle between the axes of wigglers. The laser
wave propagates in the direction having angles θ1 and θ2 with the axes of the ﬁrst and
the second wigglers, respectively. The electron beam is directed at the angles α1 and α2
to the axes of the wigglers. In the drift region the electrons are turned by the magnetic
ﬁeld. In this device the electrons having diﬀerent acceleration in the ﬁrst wiggler enter the

1

vres)/c is mostly positive and thus

drift region at diﬀerent directions. A magneto-optics set then separates these electrons and
introduces delays in their entrance phases (times of entrance) for the second wiggler. It
was shown [3]-[8] that one can control the time of electron entrance to the second wiggler
so that the gain G of FELWI as a function of the detuning from the resonance condition
G(Ω)dΩ > 0. These results were obtained
Ω = ω(v0 −
using the single-electron approximation (Thompson regime): the propagation of a single
electron through the FEL system was considered and the resulting gain was averaged over
the electron distribution. But it is known that the change of the system geometry may
inﬂuence the type of excitation regime, i.e. it can lead to a change from the single-electron
ampliﬁcation regime to the collective one and vice versa. For example, in the paper [9]
the collective regime was considered in a non-collinear wiggler ﬁlled with an overdense
homogeneous plasma.

2 Basic equations

In order to ﬁnd an analytical solution of the problem we assume without a loss of generality
that all the electrons have equal velocities at the entrance of the ﬁrst wiggler. We use
the approach developed in plasma electronics [10], which naturally describes the beam
oscillations.

Let us consider the induced radiation by an electron beam in the ﬁrst wiggler. We
choose the coordinate system so that the axis 0z coincides with the axis of the wiggler
while the wiggler vector-potential is parallel to the axis 0y. By assuming that the static
magnetic ﬁeld of a plane wiggler Aw is independent of the transverse coordinates x and y,
we can approximate it by harmonic function

Aw = Awey, where Aw = A0e−

ikwr + c.c.,

(1)

where kw = (0, 0, kw) is the wiggler wave vector,“c.c.” denotes complex conjugation, and
ey is a unit vector along y axis. The wiggler ﬁeld causes the electron oscillations along
the y-axis, therefore such an electron interacts most eﬃciently with a linearly polarized
light wave. So we assume that vector potential of laser wave has linear polarization AL =
AL(t, x, z)ey. In this case the vector potential AL deﬁnes the purely vortex part of the
ﬁeld divAL = 0, while the scalar potential φ = φ(t, x, z) deﬁnes longitudinal beam waves
in the system. The Maxwell equations can be written in the form:

The electron beam entering the wiggler is assumed to have uniform density nb and
uniform electron velocity u = (
u sin α; 0; u cos α). Then the initial distribution function
mγ0u). Here e and m are the electron charge
can be written in the form f0 = nbδ(p0 −
and mass, γ is the Lorentz factor. The integral over the initial coordinates with this
initial distribution function gives the charge and current densities for beam with charge

The above calculations indicate that if the wiggler is loaded with the non-collinear elec-
tron beam and the laser wave, then the Raman-type ampliﬁcation is feasible for relatively
small densities of the electron beam (the ﬁrst growth rate in Eq.(33)). We ﬁnd that the
electron current density required for Raman-type ampliﬁcation drops with increasing the
0 of beam. This means that collective ampliﬁcation can be realized

in optical wigglers, in particular, in FELWI, in which the ultra-relativistic non-collinear

4 Conclusions

Summarizing, we consider Thompson and Raman regimes of FEL ampliﬁcation for the non-
collinear geometry of the electron and laser beams. It was found that the non-collinear
geometry shifts the conditions for the ampliﬁcation toward collective (Raman) regime. It
was found that if the wiggler is loaded with the non-collinear electron beam and the laser
wave, then the Raman-type ampliﬁcation is feasible for relatively small densities of the
electron beam (the ﬁrst growth rate in Eq.(33)). We ﬁnd that the electron current density
required for Raman-type ampliﬁcation drops with increasing the relativistic factor γ
0 of
k
beam. This means that collective ampliﬁcation can be realized exactly in optical wigglers,
in particular, in an FELWI, which employs ultra-relativistic electron beams non-collinear
laser wave.

Abstract

The interaction between two parallel beams in one-dimensional discrete saturable systems has

been investigated using lithium niobate nonlinear waveguide arrays. When the beams are separated

by one channel and in-phase it is possible to observe soliton fusion at low power levels. This new

result is conﬁrmed numerically. By increasing the power, soliton-like propagation of weakly-coupled

beams occurs. When the beams are out-of-phase the most interesting result is the existence of

oscillations which resemble the recently discovered Tamm oscillations.

INTRODUCTION

There is a growing interest in routing, guiding, and manipulating light by light itself. Such

an all-optical concept can be accomplished through the interaction of self-guided beams,

which are often called spatial solitons [1,2]. These localized structures are found to exist in

various settings such as, for example, plasmas [3], Josephson junctions[4], molecular chains

[5], and in nonlinear optics [6]. In the latter case, the refractive index proﬁle induced by a

soliton beam exactly balances the inherent beam divergence due to diﬀraction. It has been

demonstrated that logic gates and all-optical switching are possible exploiting the interaction

of a couple of parallel beams [7-9]. Here the mutual interaction of two beams, resulting from

the additional contribution to the induced refractive index change of the overlapping input

ﬁelds, depends crucially on their relative phase. When the beams are in-phase they attract

each other while repulsion occurs if they are π out of phase [10-12]. In intermediate cases

there appears an energy transfer between the two beams [9,13].

Homogeneous nonlinear waveguide arrays (NWA) represent a periodic arrangement of

parallel, weakly coupled waveguides. They have been realized in semiconductors [14], pho-

torefractive crystals [15-17], and nematic liquid crystals [18], to mention a few. NWA could

be, for example, used for switching [19], passive mode locking [20], and tapered laser arrays

[21]. Interactions of two initially parallel beams have been, up to date, investigated only in

AlGaAs waveguide arrays exhibiting a cubic, self-focusing Kerr-like nonlinearity [22,23]. In

this work, we focus on interactions of parallel beams in one-dimensional NWA in lithium

niobate.

It is well-known that this photovoltaic photorefractive material exhibits a self-

defocusing nonlinear response that has a saturable nature [24]. Our main ﬁndings are the

demonstration of fusion of two in-phase beams and oscillations in the case of out-of-phase

beams. We demonstrate numerically that these eﬀects exist in cubic self-defocusing discrete

media, too.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe our experimental setup. Sec. III

is devoted to the interactions of in-phase beams. Here, we present our experimental re-

sults which have been conﬁrmed numerically by simulations based on a nonlinear beam

propagation method. For the sake of completeness, we add the corresponding numerical

results for cubic self-defocusing media. In Sec. IV we analyze numerically the interactions

of out-of-phase beams in both saturable and cubic NWA while the conclusions are given in

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Our sample is a 27 mm long, x-cut lithium niobate crystal. Permanent channel waveguides

are fabricated by Ti indiﬀusion. A lithographically patterned Ti layer with a thickness of
10 nm is annealed for 2 hours at a temperature T = 1040 ◦C. The sample is thereafter surface
doped by Fe (5.6 nm Fe layer, annealed for 24 hours at T = 1060 ◦C). This additional doping

serves to enhance the photorefractive eﬀect. Each channel is 4 µm wide and forms a single-

mode waveguide for TE polarized green light. The distance between adjacent channels is

4.4 µm, which results in a lattice period of Λ = 8.4 µm. The input and output facet of the

sample are ﬁnally polished to optical quality.

Our experimental setup is sketched in Fig. 1. The light source is a Nd:YVO4 laser that

provides single-frequency output at a wavelength λ = 532 nm. We form a 3 cm wide quasi-

plane wave by means of a beam expander (20× microscope lens and collimation by a second

lens with focal length f = 200 mm). To excite diﬀerent light patterns on the input face

of the sample, an adequate amplitude mask (titanium on glass substrate covered by photo

resist) has been fabricated using a laser beam writer. The mask is placed in front of a

40× microscope lens that images two illuminated holes of the mask with a diameter of

2r = 142 µm separated by d = 704 µm. This mask transmits two in-phase beams which are

adjusted by virtue of the microscope lens in such a way to excite only two channels of the

array. As the coupling in our NWA is relatively weak we restrict our study to the case in

which these two channels are separated by one channel. Green light from the output facet

is collected by another 20× microscope lens and imaged onto a CCD camera.

light in vacuum while ns = 2.2341 is the extraordinary refractive index of our lithium

niobate substrate. The periodically modulated refractive index which deﬁnes the nonlinear

WA is denoted by n(z) while ∆nnl is the nonlinear refractive index change (∆nnl << ns).

The periodically modulated refractive index can be well approximated by n(z) = 2.2341 +
0.01035 cos2(πz/Λ).

In the following we investigate the interaction of two in-phase beams separated by one

channel on the input facet. In Fig. 2 we give typical examples of experimentally observed

discrete diﬀraction and nonlinear interaction of the two beams, respectively. Here each of

the beams has an optical power P ≈ 7 µW. An image of discrete diﬀraction of two beams

from the output facet of the lithium niobate NWA is presented in Fig. 2a. In parts b) and

c) the corresponding images of discrete diﬀraction when one of the beams is blocked are

presented. These light distributions serve us to ensure the correct input excitation with

straight propagation within the array (zero transverse wave vector component). In Fig. 2d

we monitor the temporal evolution of the interaction of the two beams. After an initial

stage of discrete diﬀraction and a short transient regime a stable, steady state, two-hump

structure is formed within a few minutes.

In Fig. 3 we present experimental results for diﬀerent power levels of the two parallel

beams and compare the obtained results with numerical modelling. For this we solve Eq. (1)

numerically by using a nonlinear beam propagation method (BPM). We used the parameters

of our WA and a saturable defocusing nonlinearity of the form

∆nnl = ∆n0I/(I + Id) ,

with amplitude |∆n0| = 3 × 10−4 and an intensity ratio r = I/Id, where Id is the so-called

dark irradiance and I is the light peak intensity.

In Fig. 3 a) linear discrete diﬀraction is measured and compared with theory, yielding

the corresponding coupling constant of Lc = 3.4 mm of our sample. Experimentally, in the

low power regime (P ≈ 0.5 µW) in b) we observe soliton fusion in the central channel of the

array, in good agreement with the BPM results. This process is absent in the cubic case

[23]. On the other hand, soliton fusion has been observed in both bulk and planar waveguide

photorefractive crystals exhibiting a saturable nonlinearity [25,26]. The formed structure

possess a highly symmetric form of strongly localized mode A [27,28].

In the regime of

mediate power in c) it is possible to obtain almost independent, soliton-like propagation of

the two beams, as observed for single-channel excitation [28]. Here one can observe weak

oscillations which result in light localization either in the central element or in its ﬁrst

neighbors, which can be understood by the remaining weak evanescent coupling of the two

parallel waveguides. This oscillatory behavior has been reported in Ref. 23, too. For higher

power and thus a stronger eﬀect of saturation we observe a widening of the formed structure

(Fig. 3d), again in good agreement with numerics.

It is well known that photorefractive crystals such as strontium barium niobate and

lithium niobate have a non-instantaneous nonlinear response [29]. Depending on light inten-

sities, build-up times in these materials range from a few milliseconds to a few minutes or

even hours. Thus, we are able to perform a speciﬁc read-out of the light induced structures

that have been presented in Figs. 2 and 3. For this, after recording of stationary refractive

index changes we block one of two writing beams. The residual beam is still able to ”see” the

former light-induced refractive index change, as demonstrated in Fig. 4: The two induced

waveguides are evanescently coupled to each other, leading to partial energy transfer from

one channel to the other.

The fact that the output from the array can be controlled by changing only the power of

two beams may be attractive for fast all-optical gating. Therefore, we perform simulations in

WA with instantaneous cubic nonlinearity [2,11,22,23]. In this case we have ∆nnl = ∆n0I.
We arbitrarily take, as before, |∆n0| = 3 × 10−4 and the above mentioned data for our

the soliton-like propagation of two beams in b)] reveal that the interaction of two parallel

in-phase beams is independent of the type of nonlinearity.

INTERACTIONS OF OUT-OF-PHASE BEAMS

In this Section we study numerically interactions of two out-of-phase beams in a WA

for both saturable and cubic defocusing nonlinearities. From the investigation of bulk and

waveguide arrays with cubic nonlinearity, it is known that out-of-phase parallel beams will

repel each other [10-12,23].

Some examples of our numerical results are shown in Fig. 6. The ﬁrst four pictures are

devoted to the saturable case while the last two are for a cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity. In the

low power regime (a) one can recognize the expected repulsive behavior of this interaction

while in the high power regime (d, f) we ﬁnd a practically independent propagation of two

soliton beams. These results are in full agreement with the corresponding ﬁndings from self-

focusing discrete media with cubic nonlinearity [23]. However, the oscillations presented in

(b, c, e) that are observed for mediate power levels are a completely new phenomenon which

resembles the recently observed Tamm oscillations at the interface between a homogeneous

substrate and a WA [30]. An intuitive explanation is that out-of-phase beams are reﬂected

back from the speciﬁc channel for which the Bragg condition is fulﬁlled. Bloch oscillations

[31] occur as a special case of Tamm oscillations when the repulsive potential is a linear

function of the distance from the edge of the array. These oscillations have a promising

role in all-optical switching at low power level as reported, for example, in Ref. 32. Here

it is important to mention that in this Section we use the corresponding data of another

sample which has an approximately three times shorter coupling length of Lc = 1.1 mm

[33]. Namely, as has been shown in Ref. 30, the period of Tamm oscillations increases with

the growth of the coupling length. Thus, our 27 mm long iron-doped sample is still too

short to observe a clear oscillatory behavior. Also, the corresponding data for ∆nnl used for

the saturable case are around the maximally achievable value of nonlinear refractive index
changes in lithium niobate, which is of the order of 1 × 10−3. For lower values of ∆nnl it

remains diﬃcult to observe both multiple oscillations and soliton-like propagation of two

beams.

V. CONCLUSION

The interaction between two parallel beams in one-dimensional nonlinear waveguide ar-

rays is investigated both experimentally and numerically. As our iron-doped lithium niobate

sample has rather low coupling constant we concentrate on the case in which these beams

are separated by a single channel. We observe a complete fusion of two in-phase beams at

low power level. For higher input power the interaction decreases and nearly independent

propagation of two separated solitons is observed. Another phenomenon which does not

have an analog in the self-focusing domain is the oscillatory behavior of two out-of-phase

beams. Both eﬀects are also obtained numerically in waveguide arrays exhibiting an instan-

taneous cubic nonlinearity. Finally, our ﬁndings are of considerable interest for all-optical

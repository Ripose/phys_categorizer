Negative Index Lens Aberrations

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We examine the Seidel aberrations of thin spherical lenses composed of media with refractive
index not restricted to be positive. We ﬁnd that consideration of this expanded parameter space
allows reduction or elimination of more aberrations than is possible with only positive index media.
In particular we ﬁnd that spherical lenses possessing real aplanatic focal points are possible only
with negative index. We perform ray tracing, using custom code that relies only on Maxwell’s
equations and conservation of energy, that conﬁrms the results of the aberration calculations.

In 1968, V. G. Veselago proposed the idea that a ma-
terial could have a negative index of refraction, and de-
scribed how this would impact many basic electromag-
netic phenomena[1]. In recent years, there has been great
interest in this subject due to experimental demonstra-
tions of negative index artiﬁcial materials[2], and the in-
troduction of the perfect lens concept[3]. A perfect lens
is a ﬂat slab of index minus one, which can focus images
with resolution exceeding that possible with positive in-
dex optics.
Recently,

composed of negative index media have several advan-
tages over their positive index counterparts: they are
more compact, they can be perfectly matched to free
space, and here we demonstrate that they can also have
superior focusing performance.

The monochromatic imaging quality of a lens can be
characterized by the ﬁve Seidel aberrations: spherical,
coma, astigmatism, ﬁeld curvature and distortion. These
well known corrections to the simple Gaussian optical
formulas are calculated from a fourth order expansion of
the deviation of a wave front from spherical. (A spher-
ical wave front converges to an ideal point focus in ray
optics). The coeﬃcients in this expansion quantify the
non-ideal focusing properties of an optical element for a
given object and image position[5]. We ﬁnd that there
is an asymmetry of several of the Seidel aberrations with
respect to index about zero. Considering that an inter-
face with a relative index of +1 is inert and one of rela-
tive index -1 is strongly refractive, this asymmetry is not
surprising. However, our conclusion that the asymmetry
can yield superior focusing properties for negative index
lenses is not obvious.

We note that negative index media are necessarily
frequency dispersive, which implies increased chromatic
aberration and reduced bandwidth. However, diﬀractive
optics, which possess a similar limitation, have found util-
ity in narrow band applications[6].

To conﬁrm the analytical aberration results, we devel-
oped custom ray tracing code that does not rely on the
sign of the index to determine the path of the ray, but
relies only on the permittivity, ε, the permeability, µ,
Maxwell’s equations and conservation of energy.

Between interfaces,

in homogenous media, the ray

propagates in a straight line following the direction of
the Poynting vector. Refraction across an interface, from
a region labeled 1 into a region labeled 2, is handled as
follows. Wave solutions are sought that satisfy the dis-
persion relation (obtained from Maxwell’s equations) in
region 2,

satisﬁes all the above criteria, the ray is continued with
the new found wave vector and Poynting vector. Further-
more, since we consider only isotropic media the solution
will be unique.

We ﬁnd that the form of the expressions for the Seidel
aberrations of thin spherical lenses found in the optics lit-
erature are unchanged by the consideration of negative
index media. We reached this conclusion by re-deriving
these expressions, from ﬁrst principles, using only the def-
inition of optical path length and Fermat’s Principle. We

path may have contributions that are negative where the
Poynting vector and the wave vector are antiparallel, i.e.
where the index is negative. These aberration formulae
are further corroborated by agreement with the results
of our ray tracing.

We will ﬁrst examine the very important case of a
source object at inﬁnite distance. This is a position fac-
tor of
1. We are left with two parameters that can be
used to reduce aberrations, n and q. We will set the value
of q to eliminate one of the aberrations and compare the
remaining aberrations as a function of index. We will
restrict our attention to moderate values of index. At
large absolute values of index, the aberrations approach
the same value independent of sign, but dielectric lenses
with high index have signiﬁcant reﬂection coeﬃcients due
to the impedance mismatch to free space.

The usual ordering of the aberrations is from high-
est to lowest in the order of r, the aperture coordinate.
This is the ordering of most image degradation to least
if one is forming images with signiﬁcant lens aperture,
but small to moderate image size, which is a common
occurrence in applications. Thus, spherical aberration is
an obvious target for elimination. However, there are no
roots of C200 for values of index greater than one, which
is why this aberration is referred to as spherical aberra-
tion, since it appears to be inherent to spherical lenses.
The usual practice is to eliminate coma (the next in line),
and it so happens that the resulting lens has a value for
the spherical aberration that is very near the minimum
obtainable. Adjusting the shape factor, q, is often called
lens bending. If we bend the lens for zero coma, that is

FIG. 2: Top plot shows spherical aberration (black), astig-
matism (green), ﬁeld curvature (blue), and shape factor (light
gray) as a function of index for a lens focusing an object at in-
ﬁnity and bent for zero coma. Thin gray vertical lines indicate
properties for lenses shown in ray tracing diagrams (bottom),
meridional proﬁle (left) and image spot (right). Incident angle
is 0.2 radians and lenses are f/2. Index, shape factor, relative
rms spot size, and spot diagram zoom are shown tabularly.
In meridional proﬁle, lens principle planes are shown as thin
black vertical lines, and optic axis and Gaussian image plane
are shown as blue lines. In spot diagram, Gaussian focus is
at the center of blue cross hairs.

FIG. 3: All as in Fig. 2, except the following. Lens is bent
for zero spherial aberration. Coma is shown red. Solid and
dashed lines indicate diﬀerent solutions. Spot size, rrms, is
relative to bottom lens spot in Fig. 2. All spot diagrams are
at the same scale.

that there is a window of index values near n =

where both the spherical aberration and ﬁeld curvature
are small. There is no equivalent window in positive in-
dex.

−

Several ray tracing diagrams with both meridional rays
and ray spot diagrams are shown for speciﬁc values of
index in Fig. 2. The reference lens has index φ, which
is close to typical values used in visible optical lenses
and near enough to n = 1 for reasonably low reﬂection.
The lenses of negative index shown are in fact closer to
1, which is the other index which permits perfect
n =
transmission, so this is a fair comparison. The negative
index lenses all show signiﬁcantly tighter foci than the
positive index lens.

−

≤

These expressions have real values only for n
1/4, so an
implementation of such a lens (embedded in free space)
is not possible with normal materials.
It is a surpris-
ing and signiﬁcant result that negative index permits an
entire family of spherical aberration free spherical lenses
that can focus a distant object to a real focus, Fig. 3.
The solution with the negative sign in the expression for
qs (solid curves) has less coma for moderate negative val-
ues of index, so ray tracing diagrams are shown for that
solution. We note that at n =
1, the ﬁeld curvature is
also zero, thus this lens has only two of the ﬁve Seidel
aberrations, coma and astigmatism. For a positive index
reference we use the zero coma, n = φ lens from above.
Here again, negative index lenses achieve a tighter focus

Now we examine the case of

< 1, that is a real
object and real image both at ﬁnite position. Since p and
q are both free parameters, we can conceivably eliminate
two aberrations. If we eliminate spherical aberration and
coma the resulting lens is called aplanatic. It is a well
known, though incorrect, result that a spherical lens can
can only have virtual aplanatic focal pairs. The correct
statement is that only negative index spherical lenses can
have real aplanatic focal pairs.

If we set C200 and C110 to zero and solve for p and
q, we obtain four solutions, the two non-trivial ones are

We will focus on the solution with a minus sign for p and
the plus sign for q. This solution has smaller aberrations
for lens conﬁgurations that magnify an image. The other
solution is better for image reduction. Inserting the ex-
pressions (13) into (5) we have plotted the two remaining
non-zero coeﬃcient as well as the values of psc and qsc
(Fig. 4). Ray diagrams are shown for lenses with mag-
niﬁcations of -1, -2 and -3. Also shown is a reference
positive index lens for each. The reference lenses (which
cannot be aplanatic) are of moderate index, φ, with the
same magniﬁcation and f/# as the lenses they are com-
pared to. They are bent for zero coma but also have
spherical aberration near the minimum possible for the
conﬁguration. Again the negative index lenses produce
superior foci.

The lens of index

1 and magniﬁcation

1 is particu-
larly interesting. At this index value the ﬁeld curvature
is also zero. This remarkable lens conﬁguration has only
one of the ﬁve Seidel aberrations, astigmatism. This is
conﬁrmed by ray tracing which shows a one dimensional
”spot” at the image plane. This is perfect focusing in
the sagittal plane. Perfect focusing also occurs in the
meridional plane, in front of sagittal focus.

−

One may ask why this asymmetric lens, q =

1, per-
forms so well in a symmetric conﬁguration, p = 0. This
lens can be equivalently viewed as a biconcave doublet
with one component having index
1 and the other hav-
ing index 1, i.e. free space. Driven by this observation,
we found that all biconcave doublets with arbitrary in-
dices of
n have identical focusing properties. The only
observable diﬀerence is in the internal rays, which are
always symmetric about the planer interface, but make
more extreme angles at higher index magnitude.

±

−

Fabrication of any of these negative index lenses is
quite feasible using periodically structured artiﬁcial ma-
terials. Current artiﬁcial material designs can operate at
frequencies from megahertz through terahertz[8], where
there are numerous communication and imaging appli-
cations. For example, lens antennas could beneﬁt both
by a reduction in aberrations, which translates directly
into increased gain, and by a reduction of mass, aﬀorded
by low density artiﬁcial materials. Furthermore, these
lenses are even easier to implement than a perfect lens,
since they lack its severe structure period per wavelength
requirements and are more tolerant to losses[9]. Nega-
tive index lenses at visible light frequencies may also be
possible, by using photonic crystals, which have shown
potential for negative refraction[10, 11].

Using the current optical system design paradigm,
aberrations are minimized by combining elements with
coeﬃcients of opposite sign[12]. However, more elements
mean greater complexity and cost. Taking advantage
of an expanded parameter space that includes negative

index can reduce the number of required elements— possibly even to one.

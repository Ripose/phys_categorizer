ABSTRACT
We consider the possibility of an experimental proof of vacuum e+e− pair creation in the focus of two counter-
propagating optical laser beams with an intensity of the order of 1020-1022 W/cm2. Our approach is based
on the collisionless kinetic equation for the distribution function of the e+e− pairs with the source term for
particle production. As a possible experimental signal of vacuum pair production we consider the refraction of
a high-frequency probe laser beam by the produced e+e− plasma to be observed by an interference ﬁlter. The
generation of higher harmonics of the laser frequency in the self-consistent electric ﬁeld is also investigated.

Keywords: vacuum pair creation, strong laser ﬁeld, refraction index

1. INTRODUCTION
The great progress in laser technology expected in near future1, 2 raises hopes for a sought-after experimental
proof of some non-linear eﬀects in quantum electrodynamics, in particular, the dynamical Schwinger eﬀect of
vacuum pair creation predicted a long time ago.3–5

−

As is known5 no pairs can be created when both invariants of the electromagnetic ﬁeld vanish, E2

B2 = 0,
EB = 0. The ﬁeld produced by focussed laser beams is very close to such a conﬁguration6 and therefore the pair
creation is expected to be essentially suppressed. On the other hand, it should be possible to avoid the lightlike
ﬁeld conﬁguration with a spatially uniform ﬁeld created in an antinode of the standing wave produced by the
superposition of two coherent, counter-propagating laser beams.7 Since the Schwinger eﬀect is non-perturbative
and it requires an exact solution of the dynamical equations it is customary to approximate the complicated
structure of a real laser ﬁeld by a spatially uniform time-dependent electric ﬁeld. According to early estimates6–12
the eﬀect of vacuum creation should not be observable with presently available laser parameters. Essentially, these
estimations concerned the pairs which remain after the laser pulse when the electric ﬁeld disappears. Technically,
time interval considered has to be an integer multiple of the ﬁeld period. Another possibility was investigated in
the works,13–17 where the dynamical pair density during the action of laser pulse changes periodically with twice
the ﬁeld frequency and its mean value exceeds the residual density by several order of magnitude. In that case,
plenty of quasiparticle e+e− pairs are created even in weak time-dependent ﬁelds ω2
m2/e. Though
these pairs disappear together with driving ﬁeld, they can interact in standard ways (scattering, annihilation
etc.) during the period of ﬁeld presence some traces of these processes should be revealed.

The nonlinear eﬀects due to the interaction of intense laser beams with the vacuum can manifest themselves
in various physical phenomena, e.g., by nonlinear Thomson scattering,18 damping of electromagnetic waves in
a plasma due to e+e− pair production,12 two-photon annihilation,19 the non-linear Breit-Wheeler process,20
vacuum birefringence21 and dichroism.22 Some other interesting possibilities are considered recently in Refs.23, 24
The estimation of the two-photon annihilation rate14 shows that the ﬁeld of an optical laser with intensity
1020 W/cm2 can produce 5-10 annihilation events per laser pulse with irradiation of
1 MeV γ-quanta. The
corresponding γ-quanta can be registered outside the focus of the counter-propagating laser beams.

∼

In present work, we consider whether it is possible to observe experimentally a refraction index of the transient
e+e− plasma created in the laser focus by means of some interference scheme with a high-frequency probe laser.

In the collision of two counter-propagating laser beams form thin spatial regions with quasi-homogeneous electric
ﬁeld where conditions for e+e− pair creation are fulﬁlled. One of the split beams of the probe laser passes through
the plasma region and obtains a phase shift relative to the second beam that can be measured by an interference
ﬁlter. The density of created pairs oscillates with the double laser frequency. Therefore, a stable interference
pattern can be obtained provided the probe laser pulse is short enough. A simple estimate shows that the
intensity of state-of-the-art optical lasers is not suﬃcient for such an experiment but the critical intensity can
be reached in near future. The e+e− pairs moving in the laser ﬁeld generate a secondary electric ﬁeld which
contains higher harmonics of the laser frequency, the most intense of which is third one.

We suppose that two counter-propagating laser beams (Fig.1) form a standing-wave ﬁeld

The equation (3) was investigated carefully with reference to the conditions in heavy ion collisions29 and in
laser ﬁelds.14, 30, 31 As opposed to the ﬁrst case, where the characteristic times for pair production τp

the ﬁeld action τf are of the same order, the laser ﬁeld case corresponds to a situation when these time scales

this setting, the obtained results were negative: the residual pair density is not observable for ﬁeld strengths
Ecr = m2/e. The other possibility was investigated in Ref.14 The dynamical pair density during the action
E
of laser pulse changes periodically with twice the ﬁeld frequency and its mean value exceeds the residual density
by many orders of magnitude, see Fig. 3. We suppose that these ”quasi-particles” can undergo the standard
processes as, e.g., two-photon annihilation providing an indirect channel for the observation of the dynamical
Schwinger eﬀect.

≪

3. OBSERVABLE EFFECTS

The peculiarity of the considered phenomenon is that the created pairs are existing during the laser pulse only
and decay almost completely after the disappearance of the beams. Nevertheless, in comparison with XFELs,
modern optical lasers can generate more pairs owing to the larger spot volume, and hence may provide now
access to observable signals of vacuum decay in indirect ways, such as the production of coincident photon pairs
from e+e− annihilation (Fig. 1) or the change of the refraction index (Fig. 2).

The estimations made in Ref.14 in the framework of the S-matrix formalism show that the operating lasers
can produce in one shot a few tens of γ-quanta, which can be detected by a coincidence counter. The rate
1025W/cm3
of two-photon annihilation grows as E4, therefore the planned increase of laser intensity to 1024
will result in a huge increase of the 2γ ﬂux. A further increase of the intensity to 1026
1028W/cm3 opens the
channels for creation of heavier particles such as charged muon and pion pairs15 which annihilate into still harder
γ-quanta with energies in the range of 100

200 MeV.

Another experimental method to reveal the e+e−-plasma is to use an additional probe laser for measuring
the plasma refraction index, see Fig. 2. The collision of two counter-propagating laser beams with wavelength
λ0 forms in the focus a standing wave with thin regions (”pancakes”) ﬁlled by an electron-positron plasma with
90◦
pulsing density n(t)
which inﬂuences insigniﬁcantly on the eﬀective path length of beam in the presence of the plasma under typical
100
conditions of high-power lasers where the waist of focus is a few wave length and the pulse duration is 10

sin2 (ω0t). The direction of the probe laser beam can be chosen in the range 0

where η = ωL/ωp. It follows that n = 0.999975 for ωp = 10 ω0 and n = 0.99999975 for ωp = 100 ω0. Such small
diﬀerences of refraction indices of the split probe beams appear insuﬃcient for the emergence of an interference
pattern because of the too short path in plasma. The value of the refraction index of the plasma should increase
by about two orders of magnitude so that an interference pattern can be observed. The increase of the laser
intensity to I=1022-1023 W/cm2 will apparently be suﬃcient to create the conditions for observability of an
interference pattern for the high-frequency probe beams. To account for the pulsations of the plasma density
requires further consideration.

The registration of higher harmonics is one more perspective method for the experimental observation of
non-linear QED eﬀects in a strong laser ﬁeld. Here we investigate the spectrum of oscillations of the back-
reaction ﬁeld (7). Fig. 7 shows that the third harmonics of the laser frequency ω0 is the most intensive one and

We explore the role of laser induced anti-alignment in enhancing molecular orientation. A ﬁeld-free
enhanced orientation via anti-alignment scheme is presented, which combines a linearly polarized
femtosecond laser pulse with a half-cycle pulse. The laser pulse induces transient anti-alignment in
the plane orthogonal to the ﬁeld polarization, while the half-cycle pulse leads to the orientation.
We identify two qualitatively diﬀerent enhancement mechanisms depending on the pulse order, and
optimize their eﬀects using classical and quantum models both at zero and non-zero temperature.

INTRODUCTION

The concept of molecular alignment refers to the an-
gular localization of the symmetry axis of a molecule.
The degree of alignment is measured by
, where
i
θ is the angle between the symmetry axis and a speci-
denotes an average over the
ﬁed space-ﬁxed axis, and
molecular ensemble. A molecule is said to be aligned if
its symmetry axis lies along the space-ﬁxed axis, whereas
it is deﬁned to be anti-aligned if its symmetry axis is per-
pendicular to the space-ﬁxed axis. In recent years, var-
ious applications of molecular alignment have been pro-
posed, including high harmonic generation [1], laser pulse
compression [2], nanolithography [3], control of photodis-
sociation and photoionization [4], and quantum informa-
tion processing [5]. These applications have stimulated
the need to align molecules optimally under ﬁeld-free con-
ditions. An important milestone in the development of
alignment methods is the use of linearly polarized, ultra-
short laser pulses to create a rotational wave packet by
an impulsive Raman mechanism. If the temporal pulse
width of the laser is shorter than the rotational period of
the molecule (i.e., if its bandwidth is greater than the ro-
tational level spacing), the molecule undergoes a series of
Raman excitations that produce a coherent superposition
of rotational states [6]. For short pulses, peak ﬁeld-free
alignment along the electric vector of the laser ﬁeld is
achieved after termination of the laser pulse, at a time
that depends on the pulse strength. As the wave packet
evolves, the molecule loses its alignment, and even be-
comes anti
aligned at some later time. The molecule
also undergoes a series of ﬁeld-free realignments [7] at in-
teger multiples of the revival time, τrev = 1/(2Bc), where
B = ~/(4πcIm) is the rotational constant, c is speed of
light, and Im is the moment of inertia.
In addition, a
number of fractional rotational revivals occur at rational
fractions of τrev [8, 9].

Molecular orientation refers to the case of molecules
with a directional symmetry axis (i.e., when a molecule
has a permanent dipole). Orientation is measured by
, where θ is the angle between the molecular dipole
cos θ
i
h

and the same spaced-ﬁxed axis used to deﬁne alignment.
Naturally, orienting a molecule requires breaking of the
orienting ﬁeld symmetry. Various symmetry-breaking
methods have been proposed, including introduction of a
weak DC electric (or magnetic) ﬁeld in conjunction with a
pulsed laser ﬁeld [10], and coherent excitation with laser
ﬁelds of frequencies ω and 2ω [11]. The most versatile
method for orientating dipolar molecules utilizes asym-
metric electromagnetic half-cycle pulses (HCPs) [12, 13].
Maximum ﬁeld-free orientation is achieved some time af-
ter application of the HCP. A single short HCP has a
[13], its
limited eﬀect, however. As was shown in ref.
eﬀect saturates with intensity. An HCP applied to a
group of molecules that are initially oriented randomly
in space contributes diﬀerent angular velocities to indi-
vidual molecules, so that molecules starting from obtuse
π) move too slowly to catch up with
angles (π/2
molecules starting from acute angles (0
π/2). As a
result, the kicked molecules do not all point in the same
ﬁnal direction at any given time, and the orientation pa-
0.75. This
rameter has a maximum value of < cos θ >
eﬀect is similar to non-perfect focusing caused by spher-
ical aberration in geometrical optics. It was shown the-
oretically [13, 14, 16] that the degree of ﬁeld-free orien-
tation and alignment can be enhanced by using trains of
laser pulses, and enhanced alignment by a pair of pulses
has been demonstrated experimentally [17, 18, 19, 20].
(For a recent review of ﬁeld-free alignment, see Refs.
[21, 22].) Creating a train of HCPs with suﬃcient
strength to orient a molecule is experimentally diﬃcult,
however, requiring that alternative approaches be devel-
oped.

As we recently showed [23], anti-aligning molecules in a
plane perpendicular to the HCP polarization can enhance
the orienting eﬀect of the HCP. In the current paper we
investigate in detail the ”orientation via anti-alignment”
approach that combines an asymmetric half-cycle pulse
with a symmetric femtosecond laser pulse. The latter
induces anti
alignment, whereas the HCP orients the
molecules. Depending on the pulse order, we identify two
diﬀerent mechanisms for enhanced ﬁeld-free orientation,

−

and describe them qualitatively in section II. A rigorous
formulation of the problem is given in III. A classical
approach to the model at zero and ﬁnite temperatures
is presented in section IV, and a full quantum treatment
is developed in section V, where we also demonstrate
further enhancement via a three pulse scheme. Finally,
we summarize our ﬁndings in section VI.

II. ”ORIENTING AN ANTI-ALIGNED STATE”
AND ”CORRECTING THE ROTATIONAL
VELOCITY ABERRATION”

We identiﬁed two qualitatively diﬀerent mechanisms
for the orientation enhancement, which we term ”orient-
ing an anti-aligned state” and ”correcting the rotational
velocity aberration,” depending on the temporal order of
the pulses.

−

The ”orienting an anti-aligned state” mechanism is il-
lustrated in Fig. 1. The top drawing depicts a ran-
domly oriented collection of molecules. A short sym-
metric laser pulse applied to the molecules pushes their
symmetry axes toward the plane perpendicular to the de-
sired orientation direction, preparing the molecules in an
aligned state angularly localized near θ = π/2. A
anti
schematic illustration of the anti
aligned state is given
in the middle drawing. When a delayed strong asymmet-
ric HCP is applied to such an ensemble, all the molecules
gain nearly the same rotational velocity. Because all the
molecules depart from the anti-aligned state with very
similar initial angles, they reach the orientation direc-
tion almost simultaneously at some later time, pointing
in the same direction, as depicted in the bottom draw-
ing. As is apparent from the bottom two drawings in Fig.

−

FIG. 1: ”Orienting an anti-aligned state” mechanism. (Top)
The symmetric pulse is applied to an ensemble of randomly
oriented molecules.
(Middle) After a time t1, when the
molecules are anti-aligned, an asymmetric orienting pulse is
applied. (Bottom) After an additional time t2, the molecules
are oriented.

1, the more strongly the molecules are anti-aligned, the
better they subsequently become oriented.

The ”correcting the rotational velocity aberration”
mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 2. First, we apply the
asymmetric HCP. The molecules gain angular velocity in
the direction illustrated in Fig. 2 by the ﬁlled arrows.

2

Then, shortly af ter the orienting HCP (or even simul-
taneously with it), we apply the symmetric laser pulse.
Such a pulse decelerates the rotation of molecular dipoles
having acute angles with respect to the orientation direc-
tion and accelerates those dipoles having obtuse angles.
The directions of the angular velocity induced by the
symmetric pulse is illustrated in Fig. 2 by the open ar-
rows. This eﬀect compensates for spherical aberration
in the angular distribution of the rotational velocity dis-
tribution and improves the overall orientation at a later
time.

FIG. 2: ”Correcting the rotational velocity aberration” mech-
anism. Two schematic molecules are plotted. The ﬁlled ar-
rows denote the ﬁrst HCP orienting direction, and the open
arrows denote the second symmetric pulse directions. The
molecule at θ < π/2 is decelerated by the symmetric pulse,
whereas the molecule at θ > π/2 is accelerated by the sym-
metric pulse.

In the following sections we demonstrate for both
mechanisms that signiﬁcantly enhanced orientation may
be achieved by a proper choice of the delay between the
pulses and of their relative intensities.

III. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

The Hamiltonian of a 3D driven rigid rotor (linear
molecule) interacting with a linearly polarized ﬁeld is
given by

H =

+ V (θ, t),

(1)

ˆJ 2
2Im

where ˆJ is the angular momentum operator and θ is the
angle between the molecular axis and the polarization
vector of the ﬁeld. For a symmetric laser pulse interact-
ing with the induced polarization, the interaction term,
averaged over the fast optical oscillations, is given by

V (θ, t) =

1
4

−

ε2(t)[(αk −

α⊥) cos2(θ) + α⊥],

(2)

where ε(t) is the envelope of the laser ﬁeld, and αk and
α⊥ are the parallel and perpendicular components of the
polarizability tensor, respectively. For a symmetric laser
pulse the contribution from the permanent dipole aver-
ages to zero.

For an asymmetric HCP, the interaction with the

dipole moment is given by

V (θ, t) =

µε(t) cos(θ),

(3)

−

where µ is the permanent dipole moment and ε(t) is the
amplitude of the HCP. In the present paper we assume
that the duration of the laser pulse is much shorter than
the contributing periods of the rotational wave packet,
so that the excitation dynamics may be calculated in the
impulsive limit. The impulse imparted to the rotator
is characterized by a dimensionless kick strength (or ac-
tion), P. For an asymmetric pulse, P is given by

Pa = (µ/~)

ε(t)dt,

∞

−∞

(4)

(5)

where the integration is performed over the unidirectional
part of the HCP, and

Ps = (1/4~)(αk −

α⊥)

∞

Z

−∞

ε2(t)dt

for a symmetric pulse. We start with the mechanism of
”orienting an anti-aligned state” and consider a rotator
excited ﬁrst with a symmetric pulse of strength Ps at
t = 0 and then with an asymmetric pulse of strength Pa
at t = t1. Henceforth the dimensionless time is measured
in the units of Im/~ = τrev/2π.

IV. CLASSICAL TREATMENT

Considerable physical insight may be derived from the
(semi)-classical treatment of the problem, which is valid
1. This is a natural approach to the process
for Ps, Pa ≫
of enhanced orientation involving highly excited rota-
tional states. In this section we formulate the orientation
problem classically. A more general (although less intu-
itive) quantum mechanical treatment of the same prob-
lem is provided in section V. Classically, if a rotationless
molecule is initially aligned at angle θ0, it will be found
at the same angle just after the ﬁrst symmetric kick (see
Eqs.(2),(5)) but with angular velocity
Ps sin(2θ0), so
that at some later time it will have an angle

−

θ(t) = θ0

Pst sin(2θ0).

−

(6)

When the orienting pulse of strength Pa is applied at
time t = t1, the velocity increment is
Pa sin[θ(t1)], so
that the angular velocity after the second pulse is ω(θ0) =
Pst1 sin(2θ0)]. The angle θ at

A similar expression may be derived for the inverse
order of pulses, utilized in the second mechanism of en-
hanced orientation. The alignment at time t = t1 and
orientation at time t = t1 + t2 is calculated by averaging

alignment may be achieved via two related methods. The
ﬁrst one is of a classical nature. It operates on a short
time-scale (t << τrev) and requires negative values of
the kick strength Ps. Pulses with negative Ps produce
anti-alignment by pushing molecules into the equatorial
plane (θ = π/2). Fig. 3a shows the expectation value
of
calculated both classically and quantum me-
chanically (as will be explained in section V) for a pulse
10. Both treatments predict a deep min-
with Ps =

. There are various ways of achieving a
Ps|

negative kick strength of the symmetric pulse. First,
some alkali halides (such as LiF ) have a negative polar-
α⊥)[24]. Second, the interac-
izability anisotropy (αk −
tion of molecules with a circularly polarized light pulse
propagating in the direction of the desired orientation is
proportional to Ps sin2 θ = Ps −
Ps cos2 θ. This result is
formally equivalent to the interaction with a linearly po-
larized pulse (our model) having negative kick strength.
A third method of achieving anti-alignment uses laser
pulses with positive Ps, which cause a substantial
alignment on a short (classical) time scale af ter the kick
(see Fig. 3b). However, if it were possible to invert the
dynamics and travel backwards in time, one would ob-
serve a strong anti-alignment bef ore the kick. Remark-
ably, the eﬀect of quantum revivals [9] provides such an
option. Indeed, the rotational wave function satisﬁes the
following equation

Ψ(θ, τrev −

t) = Ψ(θ,

t),

−

(9)

and, for suﬃciently strong pulses, quantum dynamics
just before one full revival cycle is equivalent to classical
dynamics analytically continued to negative times. As
a result, considerable anti-alignment is observed in this
time domain (see Fig. 3b).

Next we would like to optimize the orientation fac-
tor
using the classical model (Eqs.
(7) and (8)) with an anti-aligning pre-pulse (Ps < 0). In
this procedure, the model is formally extended to nega-
tive times to cover eﬀects in the full revival time-domain,
as explained above. At zero initial temperature, the op-
timal solution depends only on the ratio Pa/Ps and the
products Pst1 and Pat2. A contour plot of the orienta-
tion factor as a function of

We used the same approach to analyze the second
mechanism of enhanced orientation mentioned in the In-
troduction. In the simplest, non-optimized version, the

ously (t1 = 0). Direct numerical maximization of the

cent paper [25] as a result of direct numerical simulation

by a single hybrid pulse. More eﬃcient results may be
obtained when the HCP precedes the anti-aligning laser
pulse. In this case, our classical analysis reveals a sin-
gle dominating optimal solution. A contour plot of the
orientation parameter is given in Fig. 6. The optimal

V. QUANTUM TREATMENT

Consider a quantum rotator being initially in the
ground state and kicked by a short symmetric laser pulse

128ps, a dipole moment µ

a signiﬁcantly enhanced orientation may be achieved
with ﬁeld strengths available currently in the laboratory.
Considering a KCl molecule in the ground state (having
a revival time trev ≈

, data
and a polarization anisotropy (αk −
10 for an HCP with
taken from [24]), one expects Pa ∼
the amplitude of 85kV /cm and a duration of about 2ps
(1/e half width). According to Fig. 9, the orientation
factor
0.95 may be observed if the HCP is
followed by a delayed anti-aligning pulse of 2ps duration
1011W/cm2 peak intensity. Negative times
and 5
in Fig. 9 correspond, as was explained above, to the
dynamics in the full revival domain.

anism of ”orienting an anti-aligned state” (laser pulse ﬁred
before the HCP). The right column corresponds to the mech-
anism of ”correcting the rotational velocity aberration” (in-
verse order of pulses). Upper panels (a,c) display the optimal
strength of the anti-aligning pulse (solid lines) and delay be-
tween pulses (dashed lines) as a function of the HCP strength.
Lower panels (b,d) present the highest value of the post-pulse
orientation factor vs the strength of the HCP.

We also analyzed quantum mechanically the orienta-
tion factor after two-pulse excitation for an ensemble hav-
ing a non-zero temperature. The details of calculations
can be found in the Appendix to this paper. The opti-
mized solution for the orientation of an anti-aligned state
is plotted in Fig. 10 as a function of Pa. A comparison
between the classical and quantum thermal results was
given in Fig. 8. One may observe in Fig. 10 that the
temperature reduces the orientation eﬀect. However, the
latter is still considerably better compared to the single
HCP excitation. The maximal orientation factor for KCl
excited with a single HCP of strength Pa = 10 is 0.59 at
T = 5K. The combined action of the HCP and laser
pulse provides a much higher value of 0.69 at the same
thermal conditions. To achieve even better orientation,
one may try to add additional laser pulses to improve the

anti-alignment in the system. The simplest scheme of this
kind consists of two symmetric laser pulses separated by a
delay t1, followed by an HCP after a second delay, t2. The
optimal ﬁeld-free orientation occurs at some time t3 after
the HCP. A full quantum optimization of this scheme at
ﬁnite temperature presents a challenging numerical task,
and goes beyond the framework of the present paper. The
results of optimization at zero temperature are shown in
Fig. 11. In particular, using the experimentally feasible

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We presented an experimentally feasible method for
enhanced orientation of linear dipolar molecules using a
half-cycle pulse combined with a delayed laser pulse in-
ducing molecular anti-alignment. Two qualitatively dif-
ferent enhancement mechanisms were identiﬁed depend-
ing on the pulse order, and their eﬀects were optimized
with the help of quasi-classical as well as fully quan-
tum models. The transparent physics behind the in-
terplay between anti-alignment, orientation, and quan-
tum rotational revivals provides a solid basis for the
future design of more sophisticated and eﬃcient solu-
tions. In particular, we demonstrated that enforced anti-
alignment by a pair of symmetric laser pulses prior to
applying an HCP improves the orientation even more.
These results may be generalized to trains of multiple
laser pulses, similar to forced multi-pulse alignment tech-
niques [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In the same way,
the ”spherical aberrations” of a single HCP may be bet-

similar to Eq. (30), which gives (for negative Ps):

as well. Finally, a hybrid pair of delayed pulses may be
followed by a series of well-timed symmetric laser pulses
designed to preserve the achieved orientation over an ex-

We present here the ﬁnite-temperature results for the
”orientation of an anti-aligned state” mechanism only.
The orientation factor for the second orientation mecha-
nism may be derived similarly.

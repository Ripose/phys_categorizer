Highly dispersive photonic band-gap-edge optoﬂuidic biosensors are studied theoretically.
We demonstrate that these structures are strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the
liquid, which is used to tune dispersion of the photonic crystal. The upper frequency
band-gap edge shifts about 1.8 nm for δn = 0.002, which is quite sensitive. Results from
transmission spectra agree well with those obtained from the band structure theory.

Keywords: biosensor, photonic crystal, optoﬂuidics

1 Introduction

Photonic crystals (PhCs) are attractive optical materials for controlling and manipulating
the ﬂow of light [1–3]. One well-know property is the existence of photonic band gaps,
i.e., regions of frequencies where electromagnetic wave propagation is prohibited. Another
equally important aspect of a PhC is the existence of an unconventional ultra-strong dis-
persion. Such an ultra-strong dispersion was ﬁrstly reported by Lin et al. and demon-
strated experimentally in the millimeter-wave spectrum [4]. Kosaka et al. subsequently
demonstrated the superprism eﬀect in a highly dispersive photonic microstructure [5].
These unusual properties provide an exciting possibility for obtaining microphotonic and
nanophotonic devices that can focus, disperse, switch, and steer light.

Optoﬂuidics, the marriage of nano-photonics and micro-ﬂuidics, refers to a class of optical
systems that integrate optical and ﬂuidic devices [6]. Due to unique properties of ﬂuids,
such integration provides a new way for dynamic manipulation of optical properties and
shows many potential applications [7–14]. In particular, PhCs are interesting for optoﬂu-
idics since they naturally have voids where ﬂuids can be injected. Optical properties of
the PhC can be easily reconﬁgured by selectively ﬁlling speciﬁc voids with liquid. Chow
et al. demonstrated an ultra compact biosensor employing a two-dimensional (2D) pho-
tonic crystal microcavity [15]. Recently, we proposed simple biosensor structures based on
highly dispersive PhC waveguides [16]. In this paper we will propose biosensor structures
based on complete PhCs and the strong dispersion occuring near the Brillouin zone. In
particular, the bandgap edges of the PhCs are strongly sensitive to the refractive index
of the liquid which is used to tune the dispersion of the PhC. The suggested structures
show a potential for biochemical sensing applications.

2 Biosensor Structures and Results

Let us ﬁrst consider a 2D triangular PhC with air holes extending through a high index
ε = 10.5 dielectric material, shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The holes have a radius of
0.36a, where a is the lattice constant. Here, we will focus our study on transmission
spectra of the PhC with air holes being ﬁlled with diﬀerent liquids.
It was shown in
our previous work that both the surface termination and surface direction of the PhC
are critical for high transmission (i.e., coupling) at an interface between air and the
PhC [17, 18]. Consider the TE-polarized (magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the air holes) light
normally incident into the PhC. To enhance the coupling at the interface, we choose to
couple light to the PhC along the ΓM direction, i.e., the surface of the PhC slab is along
ΓK direction. The symmetric PhC slab is composed of 11 layers along the ΓM direction
and the distance (surface termination) between right boundary and the centers of the
ﬁrst right holes is 0.5a. Transmission spectra for the PhC are obtained using the 2D
ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method [19]. For this case, we use the periodic
condition in ΓK direction and perfectly matched layers in the ΓM direction [20] as the
numerical boundary treatment. Figure 1 shows transmission spectra for the PhC with
air holes being ﬁlled by diﬀerent liquids with the refractive index increasing from n = 1.0
to n = 1.5 in steps of δn = 0.1. One can see clearly that there exist band gaps for the
PhCs. Transmissions outside the band gaps are quite large and close to unity for some
frequencies. Peaks in the transmissions arise from the Fabry–Perot oscillations from the
two boundaries and the shifts of peaks are due to the change of the eﬀective index of the
PhC when ﬁlling air holes with diﬀerent liquids.

For the present application we are not interested in the details of the Fabry–Perot pattern
in Fig. 1, but rather the spectral position of the band-gap edge which is a highly sensitive
measure for changes in the refractive index of the liquid. To see it more clearly, the
change of the band-gap edge as a function of the refractive index of the liquid is shown
in Fig. 2. As seen, the low-frequency mode-gap edges slightly change with the refractive
index of the liquid. However, the high-frequency mode-gap edge is strongly dependent on
the refractive index of the liquid, as shown by squares in Fig. 2. As an example, the high-
frequency band-gap edge shifts δ(a/λ) = 0.012987 when the air holes (with index n = 1)
are ﬁlled by a liquid of index n = 1.1. For comparison, it is only δ(a/λ) = 0.001278 for the
low-frequency band-gap shift. Now, consider a commercial silicone ﬂuid with a calibrated
refractive-index accuracy of δn = 0.002, as mentioned in Ref. [15], where the refractive
index of the liquid varies from n = 1.446 to 1.454 in increments of 0.002. For the working
wavelength around 1.55 µm (here we choose a = 450 nm), the high-frequency band-gap
edge shifts up to 1.17 nm for δn = 0.002, while 0.33 nm for the low-frequency band-gap
edge. For comparison, we note that the shift in resonant wavelength for the high-quality-
factor PhC cavity is about 0.4 nm for δn = 0.002 [15]. The above results demonstrate
that even such a simple PhC has potential applications as a sensitive biosensor.

2

To further elucidate the physics behind the strong sensitivity, we next support the picture
by dispersion calculations for the PhC. For this purpose we use a Block-iterative frequency-
domain method [21]. The dispersion of the PhC, in absence or presence of a ﬂuid, is shown
in Fig. 3. Figure 3 (a)-(f) summarize the dispersions for the PhC, where the air holes are
ﬁlled by a liquid with a varying refractive index. One can clearly see that these PhCs
have photonic band gaps for the TE polarization, which are related to the band gaps in
Fig. 1, though the band-gap regions appear slightly diﬀerent with those obtained from the
transmission spectra. Note that the band gaps in Fig. 1 are larger than those in Fig. 3.
This is because the band gaps in Fig. 3 are for all incident directions while the band gaps
in Fig. 1 are only for propagation along the normal direction. From Figs. 1 and 3, we
also observe that the position of the gap in the transmission spectra, which are obtained
for plane electromagnetic waves incident normally on the PhC, agree very well with the
position of the gaps in the frequency band structure of the corresponding inﬁnite crystal
along the ΓM direction (denoted by red regions). When increasing the refractive index
of the liquid [going from panel (a) toward panel (f)], the high-frequency band-gap edge is
signiﬁcantly downward shifted, while the low-frequency band-gap edge slightly decreases.
We emphasize that all results obtained from band structures are consistent with those
from the transmission spectra. The sensitivity of this structure is mainly attributed to
the strong dispersion of the PhC mode. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the ﬁrst and second
PhC Bloch modes at the band-gap edge (M point, k = π/a), where air holes in the PhC
are ﬁlled by the liquid with a refractive index of n = 1.0, 1.5,and 2.0, respectively. As
seen, the low-frequency band-edge Bloch mode hardly changes with varying refractive
index of the liquid. However, for the high-frequency band-edge mode, the ratio of the
energy in holes becomes lager as the refractive index of the liquid increases, i.e., this
mode distribution is strongly dependent on the refractive index of the liquid, which is in
agreement with the results in Figs. 1-3. A somewhat similar structure has been realized
experimentally by Okamoto et al. [22], but in this paper we have studied the shift for
the band-gap edges in details an oﬀered a physical explanation for the shifts. Besides,
compared to the device in Ref. [22], our proposed device oﬀers a better resolution.

Let us next consider a square PhC with dielectric rods in air, as shown in the inset of
Fig. 5. The permittivity of the rods is ε = 10.5, and the radius of the rods is r=0.2a.
Transmission spectra are shown in Fig. 5, where the background of the PhC is ﬁlled by
diﬀerent liquids. The band-gap edge as a function of the refractive index of the liquid is
shown in Fig. 6. Similar to the result shown in Fig. 2, the low-frequency band-gap edge
hardly changes as the refractive index of the liquid increases, while the high-frequency
band-gap edge is strongly dependent on the liquid. Compared with the result for the
high-frequency band-gap edge shown in Fig. 2, the results in Fig. 6 illustrate a higher
sensitivity. The high-frequency band-gap edge shifts δ(a/λ) = 0.025939 when the air
holes are ﬁlled by a liquid of index n = 1.1. For comparison we have δ(a/λ) = 0.012987
for the structure shown in the inset of Fig. 1.

3

Band structures are shown in Fig. 7, where red regions represent the band gap for ΓX
direction. From Fig. 5 and Fig. 7, we ﬁnd that the position of the gap in the transmission
spectra agree very well with the position of the gaps for the PhC along the ΓM direction.
When increasing the refractive index of the liquid [going from panel (a) toward panel
(f)], the high-frequency band-gap edge is signiﬁcantly downward shifted, while the low-
frequency band-gap edge slightly decreases. Again we consider a commercial silicone ﬂuid
with a calibrated refractive-index accuracy of δn = 0.002. For the working wavelength
around 1.55 µm (a = 450 nm), the mode-gap edge shifts up to 1.60 nm for δn = 0.002.
The proposed biosensor relies strongly on the dispersion of the PhC band-edge mode and
the presence of a band gap. To further improve the sensitivity, we optimize the PhC
structure by varying the radius of the rods. By a careful design of the structure shown
in the inset of Fig. 5, we have been able to improve the design further. For the working
wavelength around 1.55 µm (a = 450 nm), the band-gap edge shifts about 1.8 nm for
δn = 0.002, when r is tuned to 0.1a. Compared to the biosensor we proposed before [16],
this structure not only shows much better sensitivity but it also seems relatively easy
to realize experimentally, since the design involves no cavities or waveguide structures.
Finally, this device, with a size of 5 µm×5 µm, is suﬃciently compact for most applications.

3 Conclusions

To conclude, we have theoretically studied optoﬂuidic biosensors based on highly disper-
sive 2D photonic crystal. Our study shows that these structures are strongly sensitive to
the refractive index of the liquid, which is used to tune dispersion of photonic crystal.
For the working wavelength around 1.55µm, we predict shifts in the band-gap edge up to
1.8 nm for δn = 0.002. Although our study is based on 2D photonic crystals, it can be
extended to the case of a 2D photonic crystal slab. For a 2D photonic crystal slab, the
ﬁeld will attenuate due to out-of-plane loss, but the shift of the high-frequency mode-gap
edge at X/M point (when tuning by liquid) is unaﬀected by the out-of-plane radiation.
The high sensitivity makes such devices interesting for biochemical sensing applications.

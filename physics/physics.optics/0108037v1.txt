Abstract

The distribution of radiation is investigated for the modeless laser
having a multilobe mirror with the lobes (planes) inclined by small
angles to optical axis. It is shown that change of the direction resulting
from many passages of a ray through the optical system including
a multilobe mirror may be described as Brownian walk of a point
along the plane or equivalently as a solution of the two-dimensional
diﬀusion equation. Boundary conditions for the diﬀusion equation
may be approximately formulated as null conditions at some angle
which, if being reached during the walk, guarantees that the ray escape
from the optical system. In the framework of this approximation an
explicit formula for the distribution of the outgoing ray in diﬀerent
angles is derived. After many passages through the optical system the
angular distribution tends to some universal function. In the case of
the round mirror it may be presented by the Bessel function of order
zero.

1 Introduction

It is known [1] that the angular distribution of the radiation of the laser with
two plane-parallel mirrors is nonregular (inhomogeneous) because of nonideal
mirrors and inhomogeneity of the active medium. This defect is absent in so
called modeless lasers0 [2] having no longitudinal modes structure. Another
conﬁguration of modeless laser was proposed in the work [3]. In such a laser
one of the plane mirrors is replaced by an multilobe mirror having the lobes
(planes) slightly inclined to the optical axis (Fig.1 a). It was experimentally
shown [3, 4] that this replacement makes the angular distribution of the laser
radiation smooth (homogeneous). There is no longitudinal modes in this laser
too. Light is mixed and scattered in the cavity of a multilobe mirror laser.

The form of the angular distribution in the multilobe laser was analyzed
in the work [5] by consideration of geometry of the rays crossing the optical
system with the multilobe mirror many times. Such an analysis proves to be
complicated, may be carried out only for some simplest conﬁgurations of the
multilobe mirror and gives no explicit formula for the angular distribution. In
the present paper we shall analyze the case of an arbitrary multilobe mirror
and calculate an approximate angular distribution in an explicit analytical
form. The idea of the method is following.

In each double passage through the optical system the ray is deﬂected by
a deﬁnite angle in one of a number directions depending on the inclination
of the mirror the ray was reﬂected by. Change of the direction of the ray
during multiple passage through the system have therefore the character
of random walk and may be described mathematically by two-dimensional
diﬀusion equation. Finiteness of the aperture of the optical system may
be approximately taken into account by null boundary conditions at the
boundary of some ﬁnite region of the plane. The region is a disk if the optical
system has axial symmetry. In this case the problem may be easily solved by
the method of separation of variables so that and explicit expression in the
form of an inﬁnite sum may be obtained for the resulting angular distribution.
Moreover, since each term of the sum exponentially decays with the num-
ber of passages increasing and the exponents are diﬀerent, only one of the
terms (having the minimal exponent) dominates in the case of a large number
of passages. Thus, asymptotic (corresponding to large number of passages)
angular distribution of the radiation turns out to be universal and is described
by the Bessel function of order zero.

The reﬂection of the ray by the mirrors is considered in the framework
of geometric optics and therefore the method is applicable only in the case
of large Fresnel number, a2/λL
1 (here λ is the maximal wave length in
the wave packet, a the radius of the mirror and L the distance between the
multilobe mirror and the opposite plane mirror closing the optical system).
This means that the ratio λ/a should be much smaller than the ratio a/L.
We assume too that the thickness of the multilobe mirror h

2 Double passage of a ray through the optical

system

If a ray of light which is directed along the unit vector k falls onto the plane
mirror having the unit normal vector n, then the reﬂected ray is directed
along the unit vector (Fig. 1 b)

scheme; b) the form of the ray reﬂected by a lobe of the multilobe mirror
and then by the closing mirror.

Let n0 be the unit vector along the axis of the optical system. Assume
that the vector k characterizing the ray is close to n0 and the normal n to

the mirror is close to

n0. Then we can represent these vectors in the form

−

k = n0 + ~α, n =

n0 + ~γ

−

where the vectors ~α and ~γ are orthogonal to n0 and the terms of the second
order in ~α and ~γ are omitted. The absolute values of the vectors ~α and ~γ
are equal to the angles of inclination of the ray and the mirror normal to
the optical axis. The directions of these vectors show in which direction the
ray and the mirror are inclined. Call therefore the vectors ~α and ~γ ‘angle
vectors’ or simply ‘angles’.

We shall assume that the inclination angles are small so that only ﬁrst
order terms may be conserved in calculations. In this approximation kn =

1 and therefore the reﬂection law (1) takes the form

−

k1 =

n0 + ~α + 2~γ.

−

Let now the reﬂected ray (having the direction k1) be again reﬂected by
the mirror closing the optical system from the opposite side. If this mirror
is orthogonal to the optical axis, i.e. it has normal n0, then the direction of
the ray after this second reﬂection is characterized by the vector

k′ = k1

−

2(k1n0)n0 = n0 + ~α + 2~γ.

Finally we see that the ray characterized by the vector angle ~α converts after
double passage through the optical system to the ray corresponding to the
new vector angle ~α′:

~α′ = ~α + 2~γ.

Here the vector angle ~γ characterizes inclination of the mirror which reﬂected
the ray. This mirror is only one lobe of the multilobe mirror. In each double
passage the ray is reﬂected from one of the lobes chosen randomly.

Then the x- and y- components of the random variables ξi have the same

~η (which is the sum of ~ξi) we have

M~η = 0, Dηx = Dηy = N σ2

cov(ηx, ηy) = 0.

Change of the angle described as in (7) is nothing else than Brownian
walk of a point in a plane. If N is large, then, owing to the central limiting
theorem of the probability theory, the distribution in various values r = (x, y)
of the random variable ~η may be approximated by the normal distribution:

In the preceding consideration is has been assumed that the angle ~α′ may
become, as a result of the random process, arbitrarily large. In reality it is
restricted by ﬁniteness of the aperture. This may be taken into account by
the corresponding boundary conditions for the equation (9).

4 Angular distribution for ﬁnite aperture

When after a number of double passages the inclination angle becomes suf-
ﬁciently large, the ray will be lost owing to the ﬁniteness of aperture. In the
language of Brownian walk this means that the point disappears and takes
no part in further random process. If we have initially many Brownian par-
ticles, part of them is lost because of ﬁnite aperture so that the ﬁnal number
is less. In terms of the probability distribution, its norm decreases with time.

6

At ﬁrst glance, this argument leads to null conditions at the boundary
of some ﬁnite region in the plane of Brownian walk. Adding this boundary
condition to the equation (9), we could ﬁnd the distribution taking into
account ﬁniteness of the aperture.
In the case of axial symmetry of the
optical system the permitted region might be a disc of the radius restricting
the maximum absolute value of the angle depending on the aperture. One
is attempted to impose null conditions at the angle equal to Γ = a/L where
a is the radius of the mirror and L distance between the opposite mirrors of
the optical system.

This is however not so simple. Precisely speaking, no null boundary
condition may be formulated for the angle ~α′. Yet we shall show that this
may be made approximately. The null initial condition must be imposed
at some critical angle Γc depending on Γ and the angle σ characterizing
deﬂection at each double passage.

The precise formulation of the problem is possible only in terms of the
joint distribution P (α, ~ρ) in the angle ~α of inclination of the ray and position
~ρ of the point of reﬂection this ray at the mirror. It must be required that
this distribution function be zero when ~ρ takes values corresponding to the
edge of the mirror. The problem is that the equation for the function P (α, ~ρ)
is complicated and cannot be dealt eﬃciently.

Instead of this correct consideration we shall restrict ourselves by the
function P (α) and the diﬀusion equation for it. As for the boundary con-
ditions, we shall ﬁnd, up to the order of magnitude, the angle Γc such that
when this angle of inclination is reached, the ray is with great probability
lost in some time after this.

To ﬁnd the critical angle Γc, we shall argue in the following way. Let the
inclination angle Γ0 is reached in the course of Brownian walk. If this angle
leaves unchanged during next passages through the system, then after each
double passage the point of the reﬂection at the mirror is replaced by 2LΓ0.
Then after N0 = Γ/Γ0 double passages the point of reﬂection is replaced by
the value 2LN0Γ0 = 2LΓ = 2a so that the ray will certainly escape from the
optical system.

However after reaching the value Γ0 the inclination angle will not stay
constant but change in the course of Brownian walk. The preceding con-
clusion that the ray will be lost in N0 double passages will be valid if the
change of the angle is much less than Γ0. Making use of typical Brownian
replacement √N0σ, we have inequality √N0σ
Γ0 as the condition that

≪

7

the ray will be lost. Equivalently this condition may be written as Γ0
where

Γc

≫

Γc = (Γσ2)1/3

≪

Vice versa, if Γ0
Γc then the random changes of the angle Γ0 in the course
of Brownian walk will radically change it before the ray will be lost. In this
case the fact that the angle reached the value Γ0 has no special signiﬁcance.
We see that the angle Γc is critical in the sense that reaching this angle in
the course of Brownian walk leads with great probability to loss of the ray.
This means that the distribution function P (α) must be small for
= Γc.
Approximately we may take it to be zero for such arguments. This means
imposing null boundary conditions at the boundary of the disc of radius Γc.
Thus, the diﬀusion equation (9) should be solved with the null boundary

conditions at the boundary of the disc of radius Γc:

P (t, x, y) = 0 when x2 + y2 = Γ2

This solution is easily obtained with the help of the separation of variables
in the polar coordinates. It has the form

Asymptotically (at large t = Nσ2) the ﬁrst term in the formula (10)
dominates because it corresponds to the minimal root of the Bessel functions
and therefore minimal exponent. Therefore after a large number of double
passages

It is only numerical factor α10 which depends on initial conditions in this
expression. Therefore, asymptotic (for large N) angular distribution of the
radiation issued by the optical system with the multilobe mirror does not
depend on initial conditions and is described by the Bessel function of zero
order.1

5 Conclusion

In the present paper we have considered (in the framework of the geometric
optics) the rays of light in an optical system having an usual plane mirror
from one side and a multilobe mirror from another side. We evaluated the
probability that the outcoming ray has a deﬁnite inclination angle. It was
shown that the reﬂection of a ray from one of many lobes of the multilobe
mirror inclines it in one of many directions. As a result, the inclination angle
undergoes Brownian walk. The resulting probability distribution satisﬁes
then the diﬀusion equation, with the number of passages playing the role of
time.

If there are many input rays, then the same function which describes the
probability distribution gives the angular distribution of the outcoming rays.
It was shown that the distribution alters when the number of passages of
the ray through the optical system increases. Asymptotically for very large
number of passages the distribution tends to some universal distribution
which possesses the same symmetry as the lobes of the multilobe mirror
(axial symmetry in the considered case).

If a (modeless) laser is constructed on the basis of such an optical system,
its radiation will have distribution identical with the asymptotic distribution
we have found. The angular distribution of the multilobe mirror laser proves
to be stable under perturbations, therefore the distribution (11) maintains in
the non-ideal conditions (for example with inhomogeneous active medium).
This explains why the multilobe mirror laser have smooth (homogeneous)
angular distribution [3, 4].

Several methods could be applied to increase the homogeneity of active
multilobe mirror lasers. Among them 1) the increasing of the Fresnel number

(i. e. the increasing of the laser aperture and the decreasing of the cavity
length and wavelength), 2) the increasing of the number of lobes (planes)
of the multilobe mirror, 3) the application of the active medium with suﬃ-
cient broad bandwidth (for example Neodymium glass active elements). The
above developed method of calculations may be generalized to include these
modiﬁcations increasing the homogeneity of a laser beam.

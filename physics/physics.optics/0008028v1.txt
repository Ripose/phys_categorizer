Abstract

We analyze the spatial coherence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted by a half-space
at temperature T close to the interface. An asymptotic analysis allows to identify
three diﬀerent contributions to the cross-spectral density tensor in the near-ﬁeld
regime. It is shown that the coherence length can be either much larger or much
shorter than the wavelength depending on the dominant contribution.

Introduction

The typical textbook example of an incoher-
ent source is a thermal source. From the point
of view of temporal coherence, its spectrum is
given by Planck’s function and modiﬁed by its
emissivity. For usual sources, the emissivity is a
smooth function of frequency. Thus, the spec-
tral width is usually on the order of the peak
frequency of Planck’s function. From the point
of view of spatial coherence, a thermal source is
often assumed to be delta correlated. Yet, an ex-
act form of the cross-spectral density tensor has
been derived for a blackbody radiator and it has

been shown that the spatial coherence length is
λ/2 [1]. These exact results seem to support the
statement that a thermal source is incoherent.
Yet, one has to analyze more carefully the prob-
lem when dealing with a real thermal source. In
this paper, we consider a source that consists
of a half space ﬁlled with a lossy material at
temperature T . We are interested in the emit-
ted ﬁeld so that we assume that there are no
other sources. Thus there is no incident radia-
tion illuminating the sample. Note in particular
that this is not an equilibrium situation.

Since we explicitly introduce a model for the

source, the emitted ﬁeld contains evanescent
waves in the vicinity of the interface. These
evanescent waves are not taken into account
when dealing with blackbody radiation. Yet,
they modify the coherence properties of the
source in the near ﬁeld as was shown in [2]. The
eﬀect is particularly striking if a resonant sur-
face wave is excited. It has been shown that the
coherence length can be either much larger than
the wavelength or much shorter than λ/2 close
to the surface. Temporal coherence is also dra-
matically modiﬁed. For example, the emitted ra-
diation is almost monochromatic when a surface
wave is excited [3]. These results were obtained
using a direct calculation of the ﬁeld emitted
by a half-space in the framework of ﬂuctuation
electrodynamics [4–7].

The subject of this paper is to analyze the spa-
tial coherence of the emitted ﬁeld by means of
an asymptotic evaluation of the cross-spectral
density tensor in the near-ﬁeld limit (interface-
detector distance small compared to the wave-
length). This analysis permits to retrieve the
properties reported in [2] and yields insight into
the physical mechanism responsible for these ef-
fects. We are thus able to identify all the pos-
sible contributions to the cross-spectral den-
sity tensor : thermally excited surface plasmons,
skin-layer currents and small-scale polarization
ﬂuctuations. We show that to a good approx-
imation, the sum of these three asymptotic
contributions coincides with the exact result.
We obtain diﬀerent characteristic behaviours
that vary in accordance with the dominant
term. Surface waves such as surface plasmon-
polaritons or surface phonon-polaritons yield
long-range spatial coherence on a scale of the
surface wave propagation length which may be
much larger than the wavelength when aborp-
tion is small. On the contrary, skin-layer cur-
rents and small-scale polarization ﬂuctuations
lead to a much shorter spatial coherence length
that only depends on the distance to the in-
terface. A surprising consequence of this prop-

erty is that the macroscopic theory of radiome-
try may be extended into the mesoscopic regime
insofar as emission is concerned. Note however
that this conclusion is based on the assumption
of a local medium. The ultimately limiting scale
is thus given by the electron screening length
or the electron Fermi wavelength, whatever is
larger [8,9].

1 Overview

1.1 Radiation emitted by a thermal source

In this section, we review the source theory ap-
proach we use for the computation of the ther-
mal electromagnetic ﬁeld [4–7]. We focus on the
radiation in the vacuum close to a source that
we model as a linear dielectric with dielectric
function ε(r; ω). The frequency dependence will
not be indicated explicitly in the following since
we calculate quantities at ﬁxed frequency (or,
equivalently, at ﬁxed wavelength λ = 2πc/ω.
The source radiates because it contains a ﬂuctu-
ating polarization ﬁeld P(r). The spectral den-
sity of this ﬁeld is characterized by the cross-
correlation tensor Sij
P (r1, r2) that, according to
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem [4,5,10,11],
is given by

Sij
P (r1, r2) =

2¯hε0Im ε(r1)
e¯hω/kB T − 1

δijδ(r1 − r2) (1)

The Kronecker δij and the spatial δ-function in
this formula follow from the assumption that
the dielectric function is isotropic and local. We
have taken the normal-ordered form for the po-
larization ﬁeld spectrum since we are ultimately
interested in the electromagnetic ﬁeld measured
by a photodetector (given by normally-ordered
ﬁeld operators [1,10]). The electric ﬁeld E(r) ra-
diated by the polarization P(r) is now given by

dr′Xj

Gij(r, r′)Pj(r′)

(2)

where V is the volume of the source, i.e., the do-
main where Im ε(r′) is nonzero according to (1).
All quantities in (2) are understood as tempo-
ral Fourier transforms at frequency ω. The co-
herence function W ij(r1, r2) of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld is now obtained as a thermal average
of (2), using the polarization spectrum (1). One
obtains [2,3]

W ij(r1, r2) =

e¯hω/kB T − 1 Xk ZV
× Gik∗(r1, r′)Gjk(r2, r′)

(3)

The problem is now to evaluate this expression
analytically and to obtain an estimate for its de-
pendence on the separation s ≡ r2 − r1 between
the observation points.

z1 = z2 = z. We also normalize the coherence
tensor W ij to its value for r1 = r2 in the case of
blackbody radiation

ence tensor

where K denotes a wave vector parallel to the
interface and (K, γ) is the vacuum wave vec-
tor of a plane wave emitted by the source. The
tensor wij(K) is given in appendix A, eq.(A.10).
The integration over K in (5) also includes wave
vectors |K| > k, describing evanescent waves
the source excites in the vicinity of the interface
(the quantity γ is then purely imaginary with
positive imaginary part).

1.2 Near ﬁeld coherence function

To proceed in the calculation, we focus on the
simpliﬁed geometry shown in ﬁgure 1: an inﬁ-
nite half-space with uniform dielectric constant
ε, separated by the plane z = 0 from the empty
half-space z > 0. For this arrangement, the
Green tensor is explicitly known as a spatial
Fourier transform with respect to the lateral
separation S = (sx, sy) ≡ R2 − R1. Details may
be found in [10,12,13] and in appendix A. As to

In this subsection, the typical behaviour of the
ﬁeld coherence function is discussed. We identify
several distance regimes showing a very diﬀerent
behaviour of the lateral coherence function. An-
alytical approximations for the coherence func-
tion are deferred to the next section.

In ﬁgure 2 is shown the ‘energy density’ (the
trace of the coherence tensor at coinciding posi-

tions) above a metal surface in double logarith-
mic scale. One observes a strong increase with
respect to the far ﬁeld energy density when the
distance z is smaller than the wavelength. For
moderate distances z ≤ λ, the energy density is
dominated by an exponentially increasing con-
tribution [cf. ﬁg.2(b)]. This is due to the ex-
citation of surface plasmon resonances, whose
contribution is calculated analytically in sub-
section 2.1. The other curve in ﬁg.2(b) shows
the energy density for the case of tungsten with
Re ε > −1 where no surface mode exists and
no exponential increase is found. For small dis-
tances z ≪ λ, the energy density follows a 1/z3
power law (‘static limit’) that is discussed in
subsection 2.2. The prefactor of this power law
involves the imaginary part of the electrostatic
reﬂection coeﬃcient Im[(ε−1)/(ε+1)]. The sec-
ond curve in ﬁg.2(a) illustrates the resonantly
enhanced energy density for a wavelength where
Re ε ≈ −1. The ‘static limit’ contribution then
overwhelms that of the plasmon resonance.

In ﬁgure 3, we show the normalized lateral co-
herence function at chosen distances from the
interface. In the far ﬁeld [plot 3(a)], the coher-

ence length is λ/2, and the coherence function
the same as for the blackbody ﬁeld ((sin ks)/ks
behaviour). This is not surprising since at large
distances z ≫ λ, only propagating plane waves
radiated into the vacuum half space contribute
to the ﬁeld.

When the surface plasmon excitation dominates
the ﬁeld energy (z ≤ λ), the ﬁeld coherence
extends over much longer distances [plot 3(b)].
This is because of the weak damping of the plas-
mon modes in this case. We show below (sub-
section 2.1) that the coherence length is indeed
given by the plasmon propagation length. The
ﬁgure also shows that the ﬁeld is strongly po-
larized perpendicular to the interface, as is the
surface plasmon mode.

At distances z ≪ λ even closer to the source,
the ﬁeld coherence length gets shorter again
[plot 3(c)]. We show below that in this regime,
the ﬁeld behaves as if it was quasi-static (sub-
section 2.2). This leads to a lateral coherence
length equal to the vertical distance z from the
interface and hence much shorter than the wave
length. We thus ﬁnd the surprising result that

4

thermal near ﬁelds have no lower limit in their
coherence length, as long as the dielectric func-
tion of the source may be taken as local.

One might ﬁnally ask whether the skin depth
δ [deﬁned in (23)] is relevant for the radiation
emitted by a metallic source. This question is
discussed in subsection 2.3 where we show that
in the regime δ ≪ z ≪ λ, a diﬀerent power law
(∝ 1/z2) governs the energy density (see ﬁg.4(a)
below). The lateral coherence behaves similar to
the static regime z ≪ δ, however, as shown in
ﬁg.4(b) below.

2 Analytical approximations

2.1 Plasmon contribution

It is well known that a dielectric-vacuum in-
terface supports surface plasmon polariton (or
phonon polariton) modes provided the dielec-
tric constant satisﬁes Re ε < −1 [15,16]. These
surface modes propagate parallel to the surface
with a wave vector Kpl and are exponentially
localized in the direction perpendicular to the
interface. In addition, if there are losses in the
dielectric, the propagation parallel to the inter-
face is damped which may be described by a
nonzero imaginary part of Kpl. Mathematically,
we obtain the plasmon dispersion relation by
identifying the poles of the transmission coeﬃ-
cients tµ (µ = s, p) as a function of the wave vec-
tor K. Only the p-polarization (magnetic ﬁeld
perpendicular to the plane of incidence) gives a
pole at the (complex) position

Kpl = ks −ε
−ε − 1

, Re Kpl, Im Kpl > 0 (6)

The plasmon pole shows up as a sharp peak
when the integrand wij(K) in (5) is plotted as
a function of the lateral wave vector magnitude
K [cf. eq.(A.10)]. This suggests that we get a

5

good approximation to the plasmon contribu-
tion by taking slowly varying terms outside the
integral and evaluating the pole contribution by
contour integration. For example, the denomi-
nator of the |tp|2 transmission coeﬃcient may
be approximated as

|εγ + γ2|2 ≈

|ε + 1| |ε − 1|2 Im

(7)

where γ = γ(K) and γ2 are the vertical wave
vector components above and below the inter-
face. It is essential for the contour integration
to work that one expresses the absolute square
on the left hand side as the imaginary part of
an analytic function of K (right hand side).

It is easily checked from (A.10) that the trace
of wij(K) only depends on the magnitude K of
the lateral wave vector K. The integration over
the angle between K and S therefore gives

Tr wij(S, z) =

where J0(·) is the ordinary Bessel function and
s = |S|. The individual tensor components also
involve Bessel functions J2(Ks), as discussed
in appendix B.1. The integration over K may
be done using the identity (B.2) proven in ap-
pendix B.2.1. The diagonal elements of the co-
herence tensor ﬁnally take the suggestive form

s = |S|. All plots are for a gold surface at λ = 620 nm. Dots: numerical evaluation of (5), solid lines: ana-
lytical approximations discussed in the text. The numerically computed values were used to normalize all
curves.
(a): far ﬁeld regime z = 10 λ. The trace of the coherence tensor is plotted, normalized to its value for s = 0.
Solid line: free space coherence function sin(ks)/(ks).
(b): plasmon dominated regime z = 0.1 λ. The components wxx and wzz are plotted, normalized to (the
numerically computed) wzz(S = 0, z).
(c) static regime z = 0.01 λ. The components wxx and wzz are plotted and normalized as in plot 3(b). The
solid curve only contains the extreme near-ﬁeld contribution (17).

where κpl = Im γ(Kpl) is the perpendicular
plasmon decay constant and H0, 2(·) ≡ H (1)
0, 2(·)
are Hankel functions (or Bessel functions of the
third kind) [17]. The superscripts k,⊥ indicate
the directions parallel and perpendicular to the
separation vector S in the interface plane.

Eq.(9) shows that the plasmon resonance gives a
contribution to the energy density that increases
exponentially when approaching the source.
This behaviour is reproduced by the numerical
evaluation of (A.10), as shown in ﬁg. 2(b). As a
function of the lateral distance s, the correlation
tensor eq.(9) shows damped oscillations whose
wavelength is ﬁxed by the plasmon wave vector

Kpl, as shown in ﬁg.3(b). These oscillations can
be made explicit using the asymptotic form of
the Hankel function [17]

(14)

We thus conclude that the propagation distance
of the plasmon resonance, as contained in the
imaginary part of Kpl, determines the coherence
length of the ﬁeld in this regime. For a dielectric
constant with small imaginary part, the inverse

(15)

Thermally excited plasmons thus lead to a spa-
tially coherent ﬁeld on a length scale well ex-
ceeding the vacuum wave length. They also cre-
ate a net ﬁeld polarization, as shown by the
anisotropy of the tensor elements in (10-12) [see
also ﬁg.3(b)]. This anisotropy may be under-
stood from the fact that the coherence between
points separated by S is created by plasmons
propagating parallel to this direction, and the
latter are polarized in the plane spanned by S
and the normal vector ez.

2.2 Extreme near ﬁeld: quasi-static regime

We now turn to the near ﬁeld limit z ≪ λ.
Inspecting the integrand of (A.10), one ﬁnds
that in addition to the plasmon resonance, large
wave vectors K ≫ k dominate the integral. This
is because the exponential cutoﬀ e−2zIm γ(K) ≈
e−2zK gets eﬀective only for K ≥ 1/z ≫ k. We
thus obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the in-
tegral when we expand the integrand to leading
order in the limit 1/z ≥ K ≫ k. The transmis-
sion coeﬃcients, e.g., become in this limit

The coherence tensor given by (17) shows a
power law increase 1/z3 when the interface is
approached, as plotted in ﬁg. 2(a). It therefore
takes over compared to the plasmon contribu-
tion in the ‘extreme near ﬁeld limit’ z ≪ 1/κpl.
In this regime, the lateral coherence of the ﬁeld
is characterized, as shown by the scale func-
tions gi(s/z) in (18-20), by a lorentzian shape
whose scale is set by the distance z to the source.
Hence, the closer one detects the ﬁeld, the more
it is spatially incoherent.

This behaviour may be understood from elec-
trostatics: in the near ﬁeld, the electromagnetic
ﬁelds behave as if they were quasi-static because
they vary on a length scale much smaller than
the wave length (retardation is negligible). A
near ﬁeld detector is thus sensitive to a source
area of the order of πz2, and spatial coherence
is observed when these areas overlap, hence for
a separation smaller than the distance z. Simi-
lar arguments have also been put forward to in-
terpret subwavelength resolution in optical near
ﬁeld microscopy [18,19]. The electrostatic anal-
ogy may be pushed even further: it is easily
checked that we get the same result as (17) using
electrostatic image theory. As a consequence of
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem [4,5,10,11],
we have indeed

W ij(r2, r1) ∝ Im Gij(r2, r1)
∝ Im Ei

image(r2; ¯r1, ¯dj),

(22)

wii(S, z) ≈

Cxnf
(kz)3 gi(s/z)

(17)

where Gij is again the electric Green function.
The electric ﬁeld Eimage is created by the image

7

¯dj of a dipole dj (polarized along the xj-axis)
at position r1, the image dipole being located
at the mirror position ¯r1 = (x1, y1,−z1). This
image dipole ﬁeld dominates the Green func-
tion Gij at suﬃciently close distance from the
source if the electrostatic reﬂection coeﬃcient
(ε − 1)/(ε + 1) has a nonzero imaginary part
[see eq.(21)].

We stress that there is no lower limit to the spa-
tial coherence length of the near ﬁeld, provided
one uses the framework of a local dielectric sus-
ceptibility. Model calculations for a free elec-
tron gas conﬁned to a half-space show that this
framework breaks down at wave vectors K of
the order of the Fermi wave vector [8,9]. For our
problem, this corresponds to typical distances of
the order of 0.1 nm that are diﬃcult to achieve
for near ﬁeld probes even in the optical range.

2.3 Relevance of the skin depth

It has become clear from the two preceding sub-
sections that the lateral coherence of near ﬁeld
radiation strongly depends on the distance of
observation to the source. It might have been ex-
pected that the skin depth shows up in this dis-
cussion, since it governs the penetration depth
for electric ﬁelds into the metal. We conclude
our analytical work by identifying the relevance
of this length scale.

Recall that the skin depth is given by

δ =

λ/2π
Im√ε

(23)

For good conductors and low frequencies, the
dielectric function is dominated by its zero-
frequency pole

ε =

iσ
ε0ω

(24)

8

where σ is the (possibly frequency dependent)
conductivity. In particular, one has |ε| ≫ 1
and δ ≪ λ in this regime: the source material
hence approaches a perfect conductor. This im-
plies that the large K expansion of the trans-
mission coeﬃcients in (A.10) has to be recon-
sidered: while the limit K ≫ k may be jus-
tiﬁed, the limit K ≫ k|√ε| may be not. We
ﬁnd that there exists an intermediate distance
regime δ ≪ z ≪ λ (corresponding to wave vec-
tors k|√ε| ≫ K ≫ k) where the coherence
tensor shows a diﬀerent behaviour [20]. The ex-
pansion of the transmission coeﬃcients in this
regime reads

(1 + u2/4)3/2

(26)

(27)

The skin layer dominated regime is thus char-
acterized by a 1/z2 power law for the energy
density. As shown in ﬁgure 4(a), the skin depth
δ separates this regime from the extreme near
ﬁeld where a diﬀerent power law 1/z3 prevails.
We observe from ﬁg.4(b) and (26) that the lat-
eral coherence length is equal to the distance
z from the source, as in the extreme near ﬁeld
regime. This is not so surprising since the ﬁeld
propagation in the vacuum half space above the
source is governed by the length scales λ and
z, whatever the smaller, while the skin depth
is only relevant for the propagation inside the
source.

Fig. 4. Near ﬁeld coherence in the skin-eﬀect dominated regime δ ≪ z ≪ λ, typical for metals in the far
infrared. Dots: numerical evaluation of the integral (5), lines: analytic asymptotics discussed in the text.
(a): energy density Tr wij(S = 0, z) above a metallic surface with ε = −8.26 + i 104 (gold extrapolated to
λ = 3.7 µm). The solid line is the sum of the asymptotic contributions derived in this paper. (b): normalized
lateral coherence functions wii(S, z)/wzz(0, z) (i = x, z) for ﬁxed distance z, plotted vs. the lateral separa-
tion s = |S|. The x- and z-polarizations diﬀer because the plasmon contribution already comes into play.
The numerically computed wzz(0, z) was used to normalize all curves, this is why the analytic correlations
exceed unity.

To conclude, we recall that the diﬀerent contri-
butions to the correlation tensor originate in dis-
tinct domains on the K-axis in the integral (5).
The total correlation tensor is therefore given
by the sum of the surface plasmon, extreme near
ﬁeld, and skin-layer contributions. The accuracy
of this approximation is visible in ﬁgs.2, 4(a).
Note that in the ﬁgures, the numerically com-
puted far-ﬁeld energy density has been added to
get the correct large distance limit.

3 Conclusion

In the near ﬁeld, the spatial coherence of ther-
mal radiation diﬀers strongly from the black-
body ﬁeld. Conﬁned ﬁeld modes like surface
plasmon polaritons that propagate along the
source surface make the ﬁeld spatially coherent
over large scales if they dominate the radiation
density. At close distance (smaller than the skin
depth), the radiation is dominated by quasi-
static ﬁelds, and the coherence length drops well
below the wave length, being limited only by the
(non)locality of the dielectric response of the
source material. The cross over between these
regimes is determined by the skin depth and

the electrostatic reﬂection coeﬃcient. We con-
clude that in the near ﬁeld, macroscopic con-
cepts like a local emissivity are still meaningful
at the subwavelength scale, provided coherent
surface excitations are absent or subdominant.

The asymptotic forms for the cross spectral
density tensor obtained in this paper are use-
ful to characterize thermal noise ﬁelds that
may perturb particles in integrated microtraps
‘mounted’ with electromagnetic ﬁelds above a
solid surface [21–28]. The concomitant scatter-
ing and decoherence of the guided matter waves
is discussed elsewhere [29,30].

The ﬂuctuation electrodynamics used in this pa-
per enabled us to treat a non-equilibrium situa-
tion (thermal source in vacuum at T = 0) where
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem for the elec-
tric ﬁeld is not immediately applicable. In par-
ticular, we neglected the zero-point radiation
impinging on the interface from the empty half-
space. The domain of validity of this approxi-
mation, as well as the calculation of anti-normal
ordered correlation functions will be the subject
of future investigations.

A Notations for the plane interface

When the Green tensor (A.1) is inserted into
the integral (3), the spatial integration over R′
yields a δ-function for the lateral wave vectors.
The integration over z′ is then

The Green tensor describing the emission from
the source z′ < 0 into the vacuum half space
z > 0 may be written in spatial Fourier space
as [10,12]

We use bold capitals to denote vectors parallel
to the interface, e.g., K = (kx, ky, 0). The ver-
tical components of the wave vectors in vacuum
and inside the source are, respectively,

B Components of the coherence tensor

In this appendix, we outline the calculation for
the components of the coherence tensor.

B.1 Angular integrations

The only quantities in (A.10) that depend on
the angle ϕ between the lateral wavevector K
and the separation S are the polarization vec-
tors eµ. To simplify the calculation, we choose
the x-axis parallel to S. We then get the follow-
ing azimuthal integrals (eq.9.1.18 of [17])

The integrals with sin ϕ cos ϕ vanish due to par-
ity. We also note that one also gets nonzero oﬀ-
diagonal elements W xz, W zx due to p-polarized
modes. For simplicity, these are not discussed
here.

B.2 Radial integrations

We are left with integrals over the radial wave
vector K. These are worked out using the deﬁ-
nitions (A.6) of the polarization vectors and the
transmission coeﬃcients (A.7).

B.2.1 Plasmon pole

To ﬁnd the plasmon contribution, we extract, as
mentioned in the main text, the pole of the tp
coeﬃcient and approximate the other factors by
their values at the pole. The remaining integral
can be reduced to the following standard form

x2 − q2 J0(xs) =

H (1)

0 (qs)

(B.2)

for Im q > 0, s > 0. To prove this identity, we
use contour integration. The Bessel function is
written as ([17], eqs. 9.1.3, 9.1.39)

J0(x) =

nentially for |x| → ∞ there [see eq.(14)]. There-
fore, closing the integration contour with a half
circle, the integral is given by the residue at the
pole x = +q (because Im q > 0), and we get

part, we ﬁnd both the trace and the zz-
component (12) of the correlation tensor (9).

For the xx- and yy components of the coher-
ence tensor, we also need the integral (B.2) with
the Bessel function J2(xs) instead of J0(xs) [cf.
eq.(B.1)]. Using the same reasoning as above,
this integral is transformed into

(B.6)

In addition to the pole at x = q, we now have
a contribution from the −4i/(xs)2 singularity of
the Bessel H (1)
2 (xs) function at the origin. This
singularity lies on the integration path and is
therefore taken into account by half its (neg-
ative) residue at x = 0. Combining the latter
with the residue at x = q, we get

We may verify the sign of the second term by
checking that the function (B.7) vanishes in the
limit s → 0, as is the case for the left hand side
of (B.6).

B.2.2 Near ﬁeld regime

In the near ﬁeld regimes K ≫ k|√ε| (extreme
near ﬁeld) and k|√ε| ≫ K ≫ k (skin layer

dominated regime), the expansions (16, 25) of

the transmission coeﬃcients are straightforward
to obtain. The ﬁnal integration involves integer
powers of K times products of Bessel functions
and exponentials and is performed using the fol-
lowing identity

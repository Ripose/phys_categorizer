Abstract
Imperfections in the surface of intracavity
elements of an optical ring resonator can scatter light
from one mode into the counterpropagating mode. The
phase-locking of the cavity modes induced by this backscat-
tering is a well-known example that notoriously aﬄicts
laser gyroscopes and similar active systems. We experi-
mentally show how backscattering can be circumvented
in a unidirectionally operated ring cavity either by an
appropriate choice of the resonant cavity mode or by
active feedback control.

1 Introduction

Optical ring cavities have very interesting particulari-
ties distinguishing them from ordinary linear cavities.
The most important one is that the counterpropagat-
ing modes have independent photon budgets, i.e. a light
scattering object can pump photons from one mode into
the reverse mode. The phase of the standing wave formed
by interference of the counterpropagating modes then
becomes a degree of freedom. This features is exploited
in ring laser gyroscopes, whose central device is a ring
cavity. When the ring cavity rotates about the normal
vector of the plane in which the laser beams propagate,
the resonant frequencies of the counterpropagating op-
tical modes of the ring cavity are Doppler-shifted by an
amount proportional to the rotation velocity. This phe-
nomenon is known as the Sagnac eﬀect. A well-known
problem of gyroscopes is mode locking, i.e. an undesired
complete phase synchronization of the counterpropagat-
ing waves at low rotation velocities [1,2,4,3], when the
resonant frequencies of the waves are almost degenerate.
The problem arises when some amount of light in
a ring cavity mode is scattered into the solid angle of
the counterpropagating mode. This light seeds the cav-
ity mode into which it is scattered and thus forces it to

adopt the same frequency. Scattering from mirror im-
perfections is almost unavoidable. In practice in a laser
gyroscope, this phase locking is circumvented by lifting
the mode degeneracy by various means, i.e. Faraday ef-
fect, using higher-order transversal modes or modulation
of the mirrors’ positions. In particular, dithering tech-
niques where the position of one or several mirrors is
slightly modulated and the signal phase-sensitively ana-
lyzed have led to amazing resolutions in state-of-the-art
laser gyros. E.g. the tumbling of the earth’s rotation axis
can be measured with a precision of 1 part in 108 [5,6]
Mode locking is always a problem when the phase of
the standing wave in the ring cavity is needed as a de-
gree of freedom. This is not only the case in laser gyros,
but also when the subject of interest is the interaction
of a medium inserted into the cavity with the counter-
propagating optical modes. Recently, ring cavities have
been rediscovered for cold atom optics [7,8]. Atoms sus-
pended within the mode volume of the cavity scatter
light from the pumped into the reverse mode thus es-
tablishing a phase relation between the modes. However
the atoms, although they have some inertia, cannot be
considered immobile. From this results a self-consistent
dynamics with a time-dependent frequency shift between
the locked cavity modes [9]. The phenomenon has been
termed the collective atomic recoil laser (CARL). In such
a system additional backscattering from the mirror sur-
faces plays a noticeable role leading, under certain cir-
cumstances, to degenerate frequency locking for a atomic
coupling strength below a certain threshold [10].

The problem is particularly disturbing when the cou-
pling mechanism under investigation is weak. This is the
case in the superradiant regime of the CARL [10], which
arises when the collective coupling is weak compared to
the cavity decay rate. It is even more prominent in the
so-called quantum regime [11]. In the present paper, we
experimentally study mirror backscattering in a high-
ﬁnesse ring cavity. Most of the solutions developed to
reduce this problem in laser gyros with an active medium
are not applicable to our system. Here we propose a

2

scheme which can be adapted to empty Sagnac interfer-
ometer, such as our ring cavity, pumped from only one
side. It consists in compensating mirror backscattering
by injection of an additional light ﬁeld, whose phase is
controlled via an active feedback mechanism. In contrast
to the gyro, we want the absence of any light ﬁeld in one
mode to avoid seeding.

2 The experiment

The ring cavity is very similar to the one used in Refs. [7,
9]. It consists of one plane incoupling mirror with the
intensity transmission T1 = 11 × 10−6 and two curved
high reﬂecting mirrors with T2 = T3 = 1.5 × 10−6. The
cavity is L = 8.7 cm long and has a beam waist of
w0 = 107 µm. For the sake of deﬁniteness, we describe in
the following the cavity modes by their ﬁeld amplitudes
α± scaled to the ﬁeld per photon, so that |α±|2 is the
number of photons in the modes [12]. Only the mode α+
is continuously pumped by a titanium-sapphire laser at
λ = 797 nm. The laser can be stabilized to this mode
using the Pound-Drever-Hall method. The counterprop-
agating (probe) mode is labeled by α−. The ring cavity
can be operated in two ways depending on the polariza-
tion of the incoupled light. For p-polarized light a ﬁnesse
of 87000 is determined from a measured intensity decay
time of τ ≈ 3.8 µs. For s-polarized light the ﬁnesse is
6400.

Fig. 1 Schematic view of the ring cavity (mirrors M1, M2
and M3). It is pumped from one side by a titanium-sapphire
laser, which is phase-locked to an eigenfrequency of the cav-
ity. The light in the pumped mode (α+) and the reverse mode
(α−) leaking through a high reﬂecting mirror of the cavity
is monitored. For some experiments, the setup is extended
by the components shown within the dashed box. A fraction
of the light ﬁeld α+ leaking through mirror M3 is fed back
into the mode α−. Its phase and amplitude are controlled
by a servo loop such as to cancel the ﬁeld due to backscat-
tering of the mode α+. The servo can be interrupted by a
sample-and-hold (S&H) circuitry.

We measure the intracavity light power via the ﬁelds
leaking through the cavity mirrors (see Fig. 1). The out-
coupled light power is related to the intracavity power
= T1P− = T1~ωδf sr |α−|2 and P (out)
by P (out)
= T2P+

+

respectively, where δf sr = (3.4 ± 0.05) GHz is the free
spectral range of the cavity and ω/2π the laser frequency.
Although no light is injected into the reverse mode α−,
we observe that it carries a considerable amount of light,
between 0 and 1% of the light power in the pumped
mode. Furthermore, thermal drifts which slightly inﬂu-
ence the cavity geometry [and hence the resonant fre-
quency as shown in Fig. 2(a)] also cause variations of
the reverse power [see Fig. 2(b)].

The origin of the light found in the reverse mode is
backscattering from the surfaces of the three cavity mir-
rors. The mirrors (Research Electro-Optics, Inc.) gener-
ate losses due to absorption in the dielectric layers or to
scattering from imperfections at the surfaces. The losses
due to scattering are typically below S = 10 ppm for
high-quality surface mirrors [3]. Let us assume that the
light scattering from a mirror surface is isotropic. The
amount of light scattered into the reverse mode is pro-
portional to the solid angle [13]

Therefore, in units of the cavity decay rate κ = (2τ )−1
the coupling strength is U ≃ 0.06κ.

3 Frequency-dependence of mirror
backscattering

Figs. 2(a,b) suggest a correlation between the drifts of
the cavity length and the amount of backscattering. In-
formation about the nature of the scatterers can only
be gathered by injecting light into the cavity, which is
only possible when the pump laser is resonant with a
cavity mode. Apart from tuning the resonant frequency

of the cavity by modifying its length, one can probe the
discrete set of longitudinal modes by varying the pump
laser frequency. The analysis of the reverse power as a
function of the pump frequency should lead to a better
understanding of the temporal behavior of the reverse
power.

Fig. 3 The circles denote the ratio between backscattered
and pump light measured as a function of the longitudinal
mode number in the vicinity of N = 110695. The solid line is
a ﬁt of the frequency dependence of the mirror backscattering
calculated from expression (2). The curve is physically mean-
ingful only at the locations where the periodic boundary is
fulﬁlled, i.e. at integer values of ω/δf sr. The location of the
scatterers are assumed to coincide with the mirror positions,
r1 = 0, r2 = −2.58 cm, and r3 = 3.65 cm. The ﬁt yields the
mode coupling strengths of the three mirrors U1 = 0.034κ,
U2 = 0.017κ, and U3 = 0.031κ, and the frequency oﬀset ω0.

The experiment exhibited in Fig. 3 indeed shows a
strong dependence of the backscattering rate on the fre-
quency of the pump laser, when it is resonant to an
eigenfrequency of the cavity. A very simple model can be
used to describe the transfer of light between the modes
by the backscattering mechanism. For simplicity we as-
sume that only one mode, α+, is pumped by resonant
light. The pump laser is tightly locked to this mode. The
losses due to transmission through the cavity mirrors or
to backscattering at the mirror surfaces are negligible,
so that the mode α+ is in a steady state.

At a given frequency, the mode coupling induced
by mirror backscattering can be expressed by a single
complex quantity: The coupling strength B describes at
which rate a scatterer sitting at a given location shuﬄes
photons from one mode into the reverse mode. k = ω/c
is the wavenumber of the resonant pump light. The ba-
sic equation for the evolution of the reverse mode α− =
α−(t) can then be written as [13],

˙α− = −κα− − iBα+ .

(3)

The model is lend from a more general system [12,9],
where the backscattering is provided by atoms. In con-
trast, here we assume spatially ﬁxed scatterers. The cav-
ity decay rate κ describes the losses for the reverse mode.
Obviously, the coupling strength is frequency-dependent
B = B(ω). Since the cavity consists of three mirrors, the
scatterers are spatially separated. If we assume the pres-
ence of one microscopic scatterer sitting on each mirror

surface localized at the position rn along the optical axis,
we get,

The reverse power results from interference of the waves
backscattered from all three cavity mirrors. The station-
ary solution of the CARL equations (1) without atoms,
but with three immobile point-like scatterers is

.

This expression is invariant upon simultaneous trans-
lations of all mirrors, rn → rn + a. Periodic bound-
ary conditions are satisﬁed when the cavity is resonant,
i.e. rn → rn + L holds separately for every n, but only
if ω = N δf sr. Fitting the expression to the measured
values (see Fig. 3) permits to determine the contribu-
tions Un of every mirror to backscattering. The values
are consistent with the rough estimation (2) from the
mirror surface roughness.

Based on this model we may also understand the ob-
servation of Fig. 2(b). A strictly uniform expansion of the
cavity length by ∆L modiﬁes the distances between any
two mirrors by (rm − rn)∆L/L, but leaves the quantity
B unchanged. The observations of Fig. 2(b) thus result
from a non-uniform expansion of the cavity.

The assumption that the scattering defects or dust
particles at the mirror surfaces are point-like is a course
approximation. In reality scatterers sitting on the same
mirror may be much larger than an optical wavelength
and cross many phase planes. If the scattering is not uni-
form across the scatterer, the dispersion spectrum B(ω)
is additionally modulated. However, since the spatial dis-
tribution of the scatterer being on the order w cos α,
where α = 22.5◦ and 45◦ are the reﬂection angles in the
ring cavity, the spectral width will be large, ∆ω/2π ≈
c/w ≃ 100δf sr. Therefore, the broadening of the scat-
terers distribution on one mirror only slightly inﬂuences
the spectrum recorded in Fig. 3. Nevertheless, it may
account (together with thermal drifts during the data
recording) for deviations between the measurement and
the ﬁtted curve. From the experimental point of view,
the most interesting feature is that backscattering can
be reduced by a proper choice of the resonant cavity
mode.

4 Annihilation of mirror backscattering

We have seen in the previous section that the frequency-
dependence of the amount of backscattered light is due
to interference of the light reﬂected from all three cavity
mirrors. If a forth scatterer could be introduced on pur-
pose, its amplitude and phase could be designed such as
to cancel out the ﬁeld produced by the cavity mirrors.

4

G. Krenz et al.

Such an additional scatterer can be simulated by inject-
ing a laser beam into the reverse mode of the ring cav-
ity. Moreover, by continuously monitoring the amount of
light in the reverse mode and using this information to
control the phase of the injected beam, the intensity in
the reverse mode can be stabilized to zero by a servo loop
as shown in Fig. 1. This is necessary since, as shown in
Fig. 2, the amount of backscattering varies in time due
to thermal drifts. The bandwidth of the servo loop must
be larger than the drift rate of the amount of backscat-
tering, which is on the time scale of minutes. However,
one has to be aware that the phase of the injected light
ﬁeld may be subject to acoustic noise itself. Neverthe-
less, a piezo transducer (mounted to mirror M4) appears
to be suﬃcient for applying the corrections.

Concretely, we feed back part of the light leaking
through mirror M3 (see Fig. 1), thus providing an ad-
ditional tunable backscattering mechanism. Let us de-
note the coupling strength generated by the feedback
interferometer by U0. Then taking the mirror backscat-
tering from Eq. (4), including the injected light ﬁeld
U0e2ik[r0+∆r0 cos(Ωt)], the intracavity power ratio is

Choosing θ = 0 we obtain an error signal crossing 0
around r0 = rs. When the phase of the injected beam is
locked, to null the power in the reverse mode, κ−2P+ (U0 − |B|)2,
the injected ﬁeld amplitude must be tuned to satisfy
U0 = |B|.

As a proof of principle, we set up the locking scheme
Fig. 1. We reinject a light beam leaking out of the pump
mode through one of the cavity mirrors into the reverse
mode. The power in the reverse mode, whose behavior is
shown in part (a) of Fig. 4, exhibits strong ﬂuctuations
due to acoustic noise randomly shifting the phase of the
injected beam. The power ﬂuctuations vary within the
range κ−2P+ (U0 ± |B|)2.

By controlling the phase of the reinjected beam by a
servo loop its light can be made to cancel out the light in
the reverse mode due to mirror backscattering. Part (b)
of Fig. 4 shows the power in the reverse mode when the
servo loop is operating. In part (c) the injection beam
is blocked, so that the power in the reverse mode is due

is P−/P+ = 0.07%. Comparison of (b) and (c) reveals a
more than 10-fold reverse power reduction.

For detecting the coupling dynamics due to the medium

inserted into the ring cavity, the active servo must be in-
terrupted by a sample-and-hold circuitry. Otherwise, the
servo loop works to compensate the atomic backscat-
tering mechanism under investigation. Since the typical
time scale for the medium-induced coupling is µs, the
inertia of the mirrors’ positions is suﬃcient to guarantee
steady-state conditions during the measurement, even
when the servo loop is brieﬂy interrupted.

5 Conclusion

Mirror backscattering in a ring cavity is not a doom.
For a ﬁxed cavity geometry it can be minimized by tun-
ing the laser to a longitudinal resonator mode where
backscattering happens to be small. This is however not
possible if the cavity is subject to non-uniform drifts. In
this work we discussed and demonstrated how to couple
an additional light ﬁeld into the reverse mode with an
amplitude and phase chosen such as to obtain destruc-
tive interference [14]. This measure allows us to limit the
power in the reverse mode to below 200 ppm of the pump
power. A further improvement may be expected from a
more stable mechanical mounting and by replacing the
piezo modulation with an electro-optic phase modula-
tion at high frequencies. The optical sidebands generated
by such a phase modulation could be used to implement
a Pound-Drever-Hall type locking scheme, whose advan-
tage is a very large servo bandwidth.

To give a rough idea of how much the reverse power
can be suppressed with a better servo loop, we estimate
the shot noise limit. The number of photons recorded
by the photodetector of the locking servo within the
τ ≃ 1 ms integration time is n(out)
= T1δf srτ n−. This
signal is subject to Poisson-distributed noise, ∆n(out)

(10)

With typical pump powers of P+ ≃ 1 W and under the
premise of a perfectly operating servo system the shot
noise level is ∆P−/P+ ≃ 3 × 10−11. This leaves room
for improvement using a faster servo loop, e.g. having a
much larger servo bandwidth.

The minimization of unwanted backscattering will be
crucial for the detection of weak coupling forces, such as
they occur in the small gain limit of the collective atomic
recoil laser [10].

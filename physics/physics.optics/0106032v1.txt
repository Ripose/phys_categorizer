We have demonstrated an ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery-
mode (WGM) microsphere laser based on the evanescent-
wave-coupled gain. Dye molecules outside the sphere near
the equator were excited, resulting in WGM lasing in the
lowest radial mode order. The loaded quality factor of the
lasing WGM was 8(2) × 109, the highest ever achieved in the
microlaser.

The potential of fused silica microspheres lies in the
existence of the resonator modes of ultrahigh cavity qual-
ity factor Q in the optical region. These modes, known
as whispering gallery modes (WGM’s), originate from
the total internal reﬂections of optical waves inside the
sphere. Recent Q measurements of microspheres show
that under proper conditions the bare cavity quality fac-
tor can be as high as 8 × 109 [1,2]. In addition to ultra-
high Q, low-order WGM’s have much smaller mode vol-
ume than the other types of cavities of the same dimen-
sion, thus enabling much stronger matter-ﬁeld coupling
strength [3]. Based on these features, host of applica-
tions have been envisioned and some have been demon-
strated in the various ﬁelds of optical science such as
laser frequency stabilization [4], highly eﬃcient optical
power coupler [5], thresholdless microlaser [6] and the
cavity quantum electrodynamics studies of atoms [7],
molecules [8], semiconductor nanocrystals [9] or quantum
dots [10,11]. However, the loaded Q or the actual Q of
microsphere in these applications has been so far much
lower than those of the bare microspheres, only in the
range of 106−7due to many technical reasons [9,12,13],
thus making most of the aforementioned applications still
elusive.

Recently, we have reported the success of the micro-
cylinder laser based on the evanescent-wave-coupled gain
[14]. In this system, the gain for laser oscillation comes
only from the evanescent-wave coupling between the gain
molecules outside and the high-Q WGM’s inside. This
type of coupling conﬁguration is preferable in the micro-
cavity lasers with ultrahigh Q. In the usual WGM micro-
cavity laser, where the cavity itself is the gain medium,
the cavity Q tends to be degraded due to the thermal
stress imposed by direct electric or optical excitation in
the cavity. However, in our conﬁguration, such degrada-
tion can be avoided since the medium outside the cavity
is excited, leaving the cavity unaﬀected by the pumping.
In our microcylinder laser, the loaded Q reached as high
as 3 × 107. Considering that our cavity was nothing but
a segment of ordinary multi-mode ﬁber with its jacket
removed, we believe that the observed loaded Q must be

very close to the ultimate bare Q of this type of cavity.
This observation motivated us to apply the same conﬁgu-
ration to a microsphere whose cold Q can be in the range
of 109−10 and to investigate how high actual Q can be
achieved in WGM lasing.

In this Letter, we report realization of an ultrahigh Q
microsphere laser of the lowest WGM mode order whose
loaded cavity quality factor is 8(2) × 109 when the WGM
lasing actually occurs in the cavity. The overall quality
factor, Qt, representing the total loss in the lasing WGM,
is found to be 4(1)× 109. The loaded Q value reported
in this work is the highest ever observed so far in all the
applications using microcavities. In addition, our results
demonstrate the feasibility of a single quantum-radiator
microsphere laser.

In our experiments, a microsphere of 102(1) µm diame-
ter was surrounded by a gain medium, ethanol (refractive
index n1 ≃ 1.361) doped with Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) dye
molecules as shown in Fig. 1. The microcavity used in our
experiment was a microsphere fabricated by melting the
tip of a fused silica ﬁber with two counter-propagating
CO2 laser beams [15]. The typical diameter at the tip
was 15 µm. By controlling the heating time and/or the
laser power, we could control the size of microspheres
in the accuracy of a few microns. The refractive index
n2 of the sphere was 1.471. Since the Q value of the
present microsphere was expected to be in the range of
109−10, much higher than that of the microcylinder of
Ref. [14], the concentration of Rh6G was made dilute,
even down to 0.0125mM/L, which is only 1/160 of the
density in our previous microcylinder laser. In this way
we can ensure that only the WGM with the lowest loss
(or the highest Q) can undergo laser oscillations. The
gain medium was contained in a fused silica capillary of
200 µm inner diameter and 320 µm outer diameter. The
microsphere was inserted in the dye ﬁlled capillary right
after its fabrication in order to prevent any surface con-
tamination by water moisture and dust particles. As a
pumping source, we used a 532 nm-pulsed excitation of
a frequency-doubled Q-switching Nd:YAG laser (Quan-
tel Brilliant ω) with pulse width of 10 ns and repetition
rate of 10 Hz. The pump laser of about 1 mm beam
waist with its polarization parallel to the capillary axis
(let us deﬁne it z axis) was focused near the equator of
the sphere with a cylindrical lens in order to excite the
gain molecules there, and thus to excite only the WGM’s
near the equatorial plane. The beam full width along
the z axis at the sphere was about 20 µm. Since the dye
concentration was very dilute, the pump beam intensity

1

did not change much throughout the medium. We mea-
sured the emission spectrum with a spectrometer consist-
ing of a 1/4-meter spectrograph (MS257) and a computer
controlled photodiode array (PDA) detection system (In-
staspec II). The PDA was triggered by the pump laser
with exposure time of 32 ms so as to ensure the complete
recording of the spectrum resulting from a single pulse
excitations. Color ﬁlters were used to block the intense
pump light entering the spectrometer and the microscope
as shown in Fig.1.

A typical image of laser oscillation observed with the
microscope is shown in Fig. 2, where the WGM lasing
light emerges tangentially from the surface of micro-
sphere near the equator (in red). In this case, the pump-
ing energy was about 200 µJ and the dye concentra-
tion was 0.05 mM/L. The lasing spectrum is shown in
Fig. 3(a), where a prominent WGM peak appears with
other smaller ones near at 611 nm. These WGM’s are
longitudinal modes of the same mode order as discussed
below. The observed mode spacing, 0.79 nm, is consistent
with the calculated mode spacing. Polarization analysis
reveals that these peaks have the polarization parallel to
the z axis (i.e., TE polarization).

WGM in a spherical cavity is speciﬁed by the radial (r)
mode order ν, the azimuthal (in the φ direction) mode
number l, the polar (θ) mode number m and the polar-
ization (TM or TE) [16,17]. The WGM’s excited in the
experiment are of the largest |m| ≃ l since they are con-
ﬁned near the equator. Only the molecules residing in
the evanescent-ﬁeld region of the WGM can participate
in the laser oscillation. We deﬁne the occupation factor
η as the fraction of the evanescent ﬁeld volume to that of
the whole WGM. Then, as in Ref. [14], assuming a four-
level system for the dye molecules, the laser threshold
condition can be written as

N1ησe(λ) ≥ N0ησa(λ) + 2πn/λQ

(1)

where N0 and N1 are the number density of the dye
molecules in the ground electronic singlet state and in
the lowest excited singlet state, respectively, σe(λ) and
σa(λ) the emission and absorption cross section of the
dye molecules at wavelength λ, respectively, n is the rel-
ative index of refraction deﬁned by n2/n1, and Q is the
loaded cavity quality factor excluding the dye absorp-
tion loss. This threshold condition leads to the minimum
fraction of excited molecules, γ(λ) ≡ N1/Nt, with Nt the
total number density of the molecules, for inducing laser
oscillation at λ. The lower γ(λ) is, the weaker the thresh-
old pump power becomes at the given lasing wavelength
λ. As the pump power increases, WGM lasing peaks of
a given mode order appear around the minimum wave-
length of γ(λ) curve corresponding to that WGM mode
order.

As discussed in Ref. [14], the minimum of γ(λ) shifts
to the red as Nt(≃ N0) or Q increases. This trend is
demonstrated in Fig. 3(b), where the same microsphere
was repeatedly used in three diﬀerent concentration set-

tings. For diﬀerent dye concentrations, the laser oscilla-
tions were found at diﬀerent wavelengths in the spectrum
[18]. Lasing was observed even with a very low concen-
tration of 0.0125 mM/L around 598 nm with the mode
spacing of 0.75 nm. For the concentration of 0.2 mM/L,
the number of lasing WGM’s was larger than in the other
two cases and the WGM peaks appeared in a broad range
around 615 nm, which is consistent with the broad min-
imum of γ(λ) curve in this case.

Comparing the location of the minimum of γ(λ) for
various values of ﬁtting parameter Q′ ≡ ηQ with the
center wavelength of the each WGM group in Fig. 3(b),
we can ﬁnd the loaded Q associated with each WGM
group. Fig. 4 shows the calculated γ(λ) curves which
best ﬁt the center wavelengths of the observed WGM
groups. For this ﬁtting we actually measured the ab-
sorption and emission cross sections of Rh6G molecules.
Particularly, since the dye absorption is very weak in
the wavelength region ≥ 600 nm, we measured the ab-
sorption through a 15 cm long dye cell ﬁlled with high-
concentration(4 mM/L) Rh6G solution in ethanol. In the
case of 0.05mM/L (0.2 mM/L), the mode group centered
around 611 nm (615 nm) can be ﬁtted with Q = 8(2) ×
109 (Q = 5(2) × 109) with η ≃ 1/36, which is numeri-
cally calculated for the ν = 1 modes (see the discussion
below) from the elastic scattering theory [17]. The peaks
centered at 598 nm for Nt = 0.0125 mM/L can be ﬁt-
ted with Q = 1.9(7)× 109 with η ≃ 1/37. The η values
used in our ﬁttings were calculated for absorption-free
microspheres. From numerical simulations with a size
parameter smaller than the actual one we found that the
value of η slightly decreases when the absorption loss is
included. This trend would make our ﬁtted Q values
slight larger, but still within the experimental error. In
our ﬁttings listed above, we neglected this eﬀect.

The large variation in ﬁtted Q is attributed to gradual
degradation of actual Q in the course of three successive
experiments and possibility of exciting diﬀerent WGM’s
in each experiment. We used the same microsphere in
the three experiments in the order of 0.05 mM/L, 0.0125
mM/L and 0.2 mM/L. Before trying a new concentra-
tion, the capillary and the microsphere were ﬂushed with
ethanol. Each experiment took about an hour.
Inter-
estingly, very high Q values could be maintained over an
extended period of time in the ethanol environment, con-
trary to the fact that even the bare Q values in previous
studies lasted in air only for a fraction of the time span
reported in this work. [1,2].

One can deﬁne the absorption quality factor, Q′
abs ≡
2πn/(Ntησaλ), corresponding to the dye absorption loss
in the evanescent ﬁeld region. Since N0 ≃ Nt, the right
hand side of Eq. (1) is summarized by an overall quality
factor, 1/Qt ≡ 1/Q + 1/Q′
abs, representing the total loss
in the lasing WGM’s.
In the above experiment, Qt ≃
4(1) × 109 for the 611 nm lasing.

From the cavity ringdown of the WGM lasing signal we
also directly measured the loaded Q. For this experiment
a beam splitter was introduced inside the spectrometer so

2

that the spectrum and the time decay of the lasing signal
could be measured simultaneously. The experiment was
done with individual microspheres with their Q values
ranging from 107 to a few times of 109. The decay curves
were recorded with a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu
R647-p) connected to a fast digital oscilloscope (Lecroy
9370C) and averaged over 500 shots. The decay signal
consists of two exponentials, i.e., a fast ﬂuorescence de-
cay (decay time∼10 ns) with large amplitude and a slow
WGM decay with a small amplitude. We used a 50 µm
slit at the imaging plane of the PMT port in order to limit
the spectral contents going into the PMT along with the
lasing signal of a narrow linewidth. Under this condition
the amount of the ﬂuorescence photons were comparable
to that of the lasing photons, but concentrated within
about 10 ns time slot in the beginning of the curve. Par-
ticularly, when Q was larger than 2 × 109 the slow decay
part was diﬃcult to detect since the same amount of pho-
tons per shot spread over a longer decay time. For low
Q values (∼ 107) the WGM decay component became as
fast as the ﬂuorescence decay, so our two exponential ﬁt
could give a large error. Nonetheless, we could still iso-
late the WGM decay component. The loaded Q values
obtained from the time decay data are fairly consistent
with those from the spectrum data as seen in Fig. 5. This
consistency strongly supports our assessment of Q values
in Fig. 4.

The loaded Q values measured in our experiments are
as high as the expected bare Q values at the wavelengths
around 600 nm. According to the elastic scattering the-
ory [17], the ideal quality factors for the TE polarized
WGM’s around 598 nm are 1.8 × 1011 and 6.2 × 107 for
ν = 1 and 2, respectively. It is obvious that the observed
Q values cannot be assigned to ν = 2 modes. These Q
values should correspond to ν = 1 modes with Q degra-
dation in actual experiments. The major Q-degradation
in our spheres comes from the absorption loss in the
sphere medium (fused silica) [2]. The Qmed due to the
absorption loss in the microsphere medium is 7 × 109
at around 600 nm [2]. The other sources of Q degrada-
tion are the surface scattering loss of microsphere and
the absorption loss in the ethanol solution, but these ef-
fects are negligible as shown below. We measured the
surface roughness of our spheres using the atomic force
microscopy and obtained about 0.1(1) nm rms with 3(2)
nm correlation length, which correspond to Qsc > 1012
at the lasing wavelength, based on the formula in Ref.
[2] with ǫ = n2 ≃ 1.17. In addition, the ethanol solu-
tion used in our experiments contains less than 0.2% of
water molecules in molar weight. These water molecules
are uniformly distributed in ethanol. The absorption loss
due to the water molecules in the evanescent-wave region
of WGM at the wavelength of 600 nm corresponds to
Qw ≃ 2 × 1011. Therefore, we estimate the cold Q of our
microlaser to be 7 × 109, which is close to the loaded Q
values determined in our experiments.

Our results imply the feasibility of a single quantum-
the

radiator microsphere laser.

The volume of

evanescent-ﬁeld region of the WGM with ν = 1 mode
order is about 5 × 10−10 cm3 [7], so that the number
of Rh6G molecules participating in the lasing was about
4 × 106 for the dye concentration of 0.0125mM/L. Note
that due to the coherence dephasing of induced dipole the
emission cross section of the dye molecules is reduced by
a factor of 106−7 from that of a perfect quantum radiator
such as a two-level atom or a quantum dot at low tem-
perature [19]. Therefore, the number of dye molecules
in our experiment is roughly equivalent to a single ideal
radiator. However, the feat of coupling such a single
radiator to the evanescent region of WGM is yet to be
demonstrated.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a microsphere
laser based on the evanescent-wave-coupled gain and
found that the loaded Q of the lasing WGM was as high
as 8(2) × 109, only limited by the intrinsic absorption in
the cavity medium. Our results demonstrate a promising
conﬁguration of the ultrahigh-Q microsphere in various
scientiﬁc studies maintaining its high quality with negli-
gible Q degradation.

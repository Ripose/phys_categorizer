importance of the incoherence spectrum

It is shown that the properties of the modulational instability of partially coherent waves propagating in a non-
linear Kerr medium depend crucially on the proﬁle of the incoherent ﬁeld spectrum. Under certain conditions,
the incoherence may even enhance, rather than suppress, the instability. In particular, it is found that the range
of modulationally unstable wave numbers does not necessarily decrease monotonously with increasing degree
of incoherence and that the modulational instability may still exist even when long wavelength perturbations are
stable.

The modulational instability (MI) of coherent constant am-
plitude waves in nonlinear Kerr media is one of the most
fundamental phenomena resulting from the interplay between
nonlinear phase modulation and linear dispersion/diffraction
and has attracted much interest over many years [1, 2, 3]. Re-
cent advances in the area of nonlinear optics, in particular new
results concerning the nonlinear propagation of partially inco-
herent light and the advent of incoherent solitons [4], have
prompted a revisal of this issue during the past decade. The
general understanding that emerged from these studies is that
the wave intensity threshold for the onset of the MI is in-
creased by the wave incoherence. With this picture in mind,
it is remarkable that in a recent investigation of the transverse
instability (TI) of solitons, [5], it was found that the range of
modulationally unstable wave numbers did not monotonously
decrease with increasing degree of incoherence. In fact, it ﬁrst
increased until eventually it started to decrease.
Inspired by this result, we consider, in the present work, the
problem of the modulational instability of partially coherent
waves in more detail and show that the picture is more com-

analysis and to bring out clearly the new features, the anal-
ysis is carried out for the longitudinal modulational instabil-
ity. We ﬁnd that the effect of the incoherence on the MI is
sensitive to the proﬁle of the incoherent power spectrum. For
the often used assumption of a Lorentzian incoherence spec-
trum, the range of unstable wave numbers does indeed de-
crease monotonously with increasing degree of incoherence,
whereas e.g. for a Gaussian spectrum, the range ﬁrst increases
and then starts to decrease monotonously. This result agrees
well with the unexpected feature observed in [5]. Also, several
other subtle effects are shown to be possible. In particular, it is
found that the threshold for the MI to be completely quenched
is not necessarily associated with the long wavelength limit.
Modulations may be stable in this limit, but still be unstable
for ﬁnite wave numbers. This implies that the threshold for
total quench can not, in a general case, be determined by sim-
plifying the analysis to considering only the long wavelength
limit as is done in e. g. [6, 7].
The starting point of our analysis is the normalized nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation describing the one dimensional prop-

agation of a partially incoherent wave in a dispersive (or
diffractive) nonlinear medium, viz

equation is valid under the assumption that the medium re-
sponse time is much larger than the characteristic time of the
stochastic intensity ﬂuctuations.
The modulational instability of small perturbations of the
corresponding steady state solution has been analyzed using
different, but equivalent [9], mathematical formalisms. An
analysis based on the formalism of the correlation function,
[5, 7, 10] or on the Wigner approach [8], results in the disper-
sion relation

with ρ0 being the Wigner distribution function of the un-

which is the same expression as the Coherent Density ap-
proach [11], provided we identify ρ0(θ) = A2 G(θ) with A2
being the averaged normalized ﬁeld intensity of the station-
ary state and G(θ) being its normalized angular spectrum.
Throughout this paper we will use both expressions for the
dispersion relation interchangeably, since some parts of the
analysis are most conveniently handled by one approach, and
some by the other.
An explicit analytical solution of the dispersion relation,
Eq.(2) or Eq.(4), is possible only for some particular inco-
herence spectra. Speciﬁcally, in the case of the Lorentzian

with A2 > k2/4. This analytical result shows explicitly that
the effect of the incoherence, provided it is large enough, is to
suppress the MI for any value of the perturbation wave num-
ber. However, as will be demonstrated in this letter, this result
depends crucially on the form of the incoherence spectrum
and is not a general feature of the MI of partially incoherent
light.
The restricted generality of the result expressed by Eq.(5) can
be directly inferred by studying in more detail the proper-
ties of the cut-off wave number, kc, i. e. the value of k at
which the growth rate vanishes. According to Eq.(5), valid
for the Lorentzian spectrum, kc is shifted monotonously to
the left (decreased) with increasing degree of incoherence, θ0:
k2

c = 4(A2
0). For the case of a general coherence spec-
trum, kc is determined by the following equation:

where p.v. denotes the principal value. When the power spec-
trum is well localized, in the sense that its rms-width is much
smaller than the cut off wavelength, the contributions from the
zeros of the denominator are negligible and the denominator
can be expanded to yield

dication of such an incoherence-induced increase of the range
of modulationally unstable wave numbers was observed by
Torres et al. [5], in a numerical study of the transverse in-
stability (TI) of soliton structures using a Gaussian spectral
distribution. It should be emphasized though, that the effect
will occur for transverse as well as for longitudinal modula-
tional instabilities. Although the Lorentz spectrum proper is

not well localized, it can easily be made so by considering the
bounded Lorentz spectrum i. e.

where W (x) = 0 if x < 0, W (x) = 1 if x > 0, θm is the
boundary of the spectrum and C is a normalization constant.
For this spectrum one can explicitly show that, depending on
the value of θm, the cut-off shift may either increase or de-
crease with increasing θ0.
Another perturbative solution of the dispersion equation for
the MI is possible in the long wave limit when k
θ0, where
θ0 is the characteristic width of the spectrum G(θ). In this case
one can use a Taylor expansion around p of the numerator in
Eq.(2). Introducing Γ = γ/k we obtain

ﬁnds that for a Gaussian or a Lorentzian incoherence spec-
trum, the values of D1, J1, and J3 are all positive quantities.
Thus in such cases, Eq.(14) provides a sufﬁcient condition for
the suppression of the instability, as found in the works of
Anastassiou et al. [6] and Soljaˇci´c et al. [7]. Nevertheless,
there may exist spectra, for which the factor J3 is negative,

implying there is positive growth of the perturbation for ﬁnite
k, despite the fact that solution of the Eq.(14) (the long wave
limit) gives Γ2
0. Consequently, the deﬁnition for the sup-
pression of the modulational instability as the threshold value
given by the long wavelength limit approximation is not ap-
propriate.
The simplest illustration of the ambiguity of the threshold con-
dition based on the long wavelength limit can be given by an-
alyzing a rectangular spectrum proﬁle with G(p) = 1/2θm
for p in the interval
θm < p < θm, whereas G(p) = 0
outside this interval. For this simple spectrum, the integral in
Eq.(4) may be evaluated exactly and the following dispersion

However, the rectangular spectrum exhibits one more unex-
pected and very important feature: It is evident that even if
γ2 < 0 in the limit as k
0, γ2 may become positive for
ﬁnite k. In particular, when k = 2θm, the growth rate of the
perturbation is positive, γ2 > 0, independently of the spec-

Therefore, even a very high degree of incoherence does not

It is interesting to note that a similar phenomenon was found
in [12], in an investigation of the effect of a nonlocal nonlin-
earity on the MI in a focusing Kerr medium. In particular, it
was shown for a rectangular response function, that the insta-
bility growth rate ﬁrst decreased for increasing width of the
response function, but ultimately for large widths, new modu-
lationally unstable bands appeared at ﬁnite wave numbers.
Since a rectangular proﬁle is a very ideal and a bit artiﬁ-
cial form of the spectrum, we consider another example of a
well localized spectrum in the form of a modiﬁed Lorentzian,

In order to further illustrate the subtlety of the interplay be-

an = αn, n

istence of small positive roots X of Eq.(29) in the vicinity of
those resonances, independently of the structure of the spec-
trum envelope g(n). That this indeed is the case is illustrated
in Fig.(2), which shows the result of a numerical evaluation
of the sum for particular parameter values. On the other hand,

To conclude, we have investigated the role of the incoherent
spectrum proﬁle on the properties of the modulational insta-
bility. The gain curve of the instability may smoothly shrink
in amplitude and cut-off wave number with increasing degree
of incoherence, as is the case for a Lorentzian proﬁle. How-
ever, it may also initially expand into the wave numbers which
are stable in the coherent regime as is the case for a Gaus-
sian proﬁle of the spectrum. When the spectrum is rectangu-
lar, we have shown that under the special resonance condition
k = 2θm, the MI cannot be suppressed completely no mat-
ter how strong the degree of incoherence. Using the modiﬁed
Lorentzian proﬁle we demonstrate that the long wavelength
threshold deﬁnition at which the MI is suppressed due to par-
tial incoherence is in fact proﬁle dependent. For this case, is-
lands of positive growth rate emerge at higher wave numbers.
Lastly, our analysis of the modulational instability in the case
of multi-carrier operation demonstrates new additional struc-
ture in the gain curve, where besides the main lobe, there also
exist smaller peaks surrounding the discrete carrier phases.

Abstract: The present work shows that through a suitable change of variables rela-
tivistic dynamics can be mapped to light propagation in a non-homogeneous medium.
A particle’s trajectory through the modiﬁed space-time is thus formally equivalent to a
light ray and can be derived from a mechanical equivalent of Fermat’s principle. The
similarities between light propagation and mechanics are then extended to quantum me-
chanics, showing that relativistic quantum mechanics can be derived from a wave equa-
tion in modiﬁed space-time. Non-relativistic results, such as de Broglie’s wavelength,
Schr¨odinger equation and uncertainty principle are shown to be direct consequences of
the theory and it is argued that relativistic conclusions are also possible.

1 Introduction

This paper is presented in a rather crude state; the text is imperfect and some conclusions are
deferred to ulterior publications; nevertheless the author feels that this work must be diffused even
in a preliminary stage due to its signiﬁcance. The author’s presence at the OSA’s annual meeting
provided an opportunity for the presentation of his work that he could not despise.

The similarities between light propagation and wave mechanics have been pointed out by numer-
ous authors, although a perfect mapping from one system to the other has never been achieved.
Almeida et al.1 showed that near-ﬁeld light diffraction could be calculated using the Wigner Dis-
tribution Function (WDF) and obtained results proving the existence of super-resolution in certain
circumstances.

The study of wide angle light propagation makes use of a transformation which brings to mind the
Lorentz transformation of special relativity. It was then natural to try an association of Newtonian
mechanics to paraxial optics and special relativity to wide angle propagation. This process pro-
moted the deﬁnition of a coordinate transformation to render the relativistic space homologous to
the optical space. The introduction of a variational principle allowed the derivation of relativistic
dynamics in the modiﬁed space-time in a process similar to the derivation of optical propagation
from Fermat’s principle. One important consequence is that each particle travels through modiﬁed
space-time with the speed of light.

The similarity could be carried further to diffraction phenomena and quantum mechanics. It was
postulated that a particle has an intrinsic frequency related to its mass and many important results
were derived directly from this statement. More general results will probably be feasible in the
future.

2 Notes on Hamiltonian optics

The propagation of an optical ray is governed by Fermat’s principle, which can be stated:2

δZ P2

P1

nds = 0 .

(1)

The integral quantity is called point characteristic and measures the optical path length between
points P1 and P2.

V (x1, y1, x2, y2) = Z P2

The quantity ds is the length measured along a ray path and can be replaced by:

ds =

dz
(1 − u2
x − u2

y)1/2 =

dz
uz

,

where ux, uy and uz are the ray direction cosines with respect to the x, y and z axes.
Inserting Eq. (3) into Eq. (1) we have:

z1

δZ z2
δZ z2

z1

y)1/2 = 0 ,

ndz
x − u2
= 0 .

(1 − u2
ndz
uz

Of course we can also write:

with

ds = (1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2dz ,

˙x =

dx
dz

and ˙y =

dy
dz

.

It is easy to relate ˙x and ˙y to ux and uy:

ux =

uy =

˙x

(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2 ,

˙y

(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2 ,

where only the positive root is considered.

Inserting Eq. (5) into Eq. (1) we get:

δZ z2

z1

n(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2dz = 0 .

We can use the position coordinates x and y as generalized coordinates and z for time, in order to
deﬁne the Lagrangian. We have:3, 4

L = n(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2

We can go a step further if we deﬁne a system Hamiltonian and write the canonical equations; we
start by ﬁnding the components of the conjugate momentum (p) from the Lagrangian. Knowing
that n is a function of x, y and z, the conjugate momentum components can be written as:

px =

py =

∂ ˙x

∂ ˙y

=

=

n ˙x

(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2 ,

n ˙y

(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2 .

If we consider Eq. (7), the result is:

The system Hamiltonian is:

px = nux ,
py = nuy .

H = px ˙x + py ˙y − L
n( ˙x2 + ˙y2)

(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2 − L

The Hamiltonian has the interesting property of having the dependence on the generalized co-
ordinates and time, separated from the dependence on the conjugate momentum. The canonical
equations are:

˙x =

Obviously the ﬁrst two canonical equations represent just a trigonometric relationship.

It is interesting to note that if the refractive index varies only with z, then the conjugate momentum
will stay unaltered; the direction cosines will vary accordingly to keep constant the products nux
and nuy.
We will now consider an non-homogeneous medium with a direction dependent refractive index
and will add this dependence as a correction to a nominal index.

where n0 is the nominal index and nc is a correction parameter. Eq. (9) becomes

n = n0 −

nc

(1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2)1/2 ,

(16)

(17)

L = n0(cid:16)1 + ˙x2 + ˙y2(cid:17) − nc.

We will follow the procedure for establishing the canonical equations in this new situation. It is
clear that the momentum is still given by Eq. (13) if n is replaced by n0.
The new Hamiltonian is given by

The present discussion of non-homogeneous media is not completely general but is adequate for
highlighting similarities with special relativity and quantum mechanics, as is the purpose of this
work.

3 Diffraction and Wigner distribution function

Almeida et al.1 have shown that the high spatial frequencies in the diffracted spectrum cannot
be propagated and this can even, in some cases, lead to a diffraction limit much lower than the
wavelength; here we detail those arguments.

The Wigner distribution function (WDF) of a scalar, time harmonic, and coherent ﬁeld distribution
ϕ(q, z) can be deﬁned at a z = const. plane in terms of either the ﬁeld distribution or its Fourier

where k = 2π/λ, ∗ indicates complex conjugate and

q = (x, y) ,
p = (nux, nuy) .

(22)
(23)

In the paraxial approximation, propagation in a homogeneous medium of refractive index n trans-
forms the WDF according to the relation

W (q, p, z) = W (q −

p, p, 0).

(24)

After the WDF has been propagated over a distance, the ﬁeld distribution can be recovered by6, 7

ϕ(q, z)ϕ∗(0, z) =

4π2 Z W (q/2, p, z) exp(iqp)dp.

The ﬁeld intensity distribution can also be found by

|ϕ(q, z)|2 =

4π2

k2 Z W (q, p, z)dp.

(25)

(26)

Eqs. (25) and (26) are all that is needed for the evaluation of Fresnel diffraction ﬁelds. Consider
the diffraction pattern for a rectangular aperture in one dimension illuminated by a monocromatic
wave propagating in the z direction. The ﬁeld distribution immediately after the aperture is given
by

ϕ(x, 0) = 1 → |x| < l/2,
ϕ(x, 0) = 0 → |x| ≥ l/2,

with l being the aperture width.

Considering that ϕ(x, 0) is real we can write

ϕ x +

2 ! ϕ∗ x −

2! = H  l

We then apply Eq. (28) to the WDF deﬁnition Eq. (20) to ﬁnd

W (x, px) =

W (x, px) =

W (x, px) = 0 → |x| ≥ l/2,

qn2 − |p|2
W (q, p, z) = 0 → otherwise.

(31)

Eq. (31) shows that only the moments such that |p| < n can be propagated.8 In fact, if |p|/n =
sin α, with α the angle the ray makes with the z axis, It is obvious that the higher moments would
correspond to values of | sin α| > 1; these moments don’t propagate and originate evanescent
waves instead, Fig. 2. The net effect on near-ﬁeld diffraction is that the high-frequency detail near
the aperture is quickly reduced.

Fig. 3 shows the near-ﬁeld diffraction pattern when the aperture is exactly one wavelength wide.
The situation is such that all the high frequencies appear at values of |px| > 1 and are evanescent,
resulting in a ﬁeld pattern with one small minimum immediately after the aperture, after which the
beam takes a quasi-gaussian shape, without further minima. The width of the sharp peak just after
the aperture is considerably smaller than one wavelength determining a super-resolution on this
region.

4 Special relativity

Special relativity deals with a 4-dimensional space-time endowed with a pseudo-Euclidean metric
which can be written as

ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 − dt2,

where the space-time is referred to the coordinates (t, x, y, z). Here the units were chosen so as to
make c = 1, c being the speed of light.

For a more adequate optical interpretation one can use coordinates (x, y, z, τ ) with τ the proper
time:9

τ = t 1 −

the usual 3-velocity vector. Fig. 4 shows the coordinates of an event E when just two spatial coor-
dinates are used together with coordinate τ.

Fig. 4. The relativistic frame in two dimensions. The τ coordinate is the proper time while the
distance to the origin is the time measured in the frame at rest.

Considering Eqs. (35, 36) and the new coordinates the metric deﬁned by Eq. (34) becomes

ds2 = v2dt2 − dt2 = dτ 2.

(37)

The trajectory of an event in 4-space is known as its world line. In Fig. 5 we represent the world
line of an event E with coordinates (x, τ ). At each position the derivative of the world line with
respect to τ is

with

−→ν = ( ˙x, ˙y, ˙z) .

(40)

It follows from Eq. (40) that, at each point, the components of v are the direction cosines of the
tangent vector to the world line through that point.

We must now state a basic principle equivalent to Fermat’s principle for ray propagation in optics
given in Eq. (1). Taking into consideration the relativistic Lagrangian we can state the following
variational principle:3, 4

where m is the rest mass of the particle and V is the local potential energy. It can be shown that
mγ represents the kinetic energy of the particle. Using Eq. (37) a straightforward calculation shows
that ds = dτ so that we can also write

The new principle means that the particle will choose a trajectory moving away from high potential
energies much as the optical ray moves away from low refractive index. From this principle we can
derive all the equations of relativistic mechanics, in a similar manner as from Fermat’s principle it
is possible to derive light propagation.

Comparing this equation with Eq. (9), we can deﬁne the Lagrangian of the mechanical system as

L = (mγ − V ) .

(43)

We now have a 4-dimensional space, while in the Hamiltonian formulation of optics we used 3
dimensions. The following list shows the relationship between the two systems, where we refer
ﬁrst to the relativistic system and then to the optical system.

x ↔ x,
y ↔ y,
z ↔ no equivalent,
τ ↔ z.

In the mapping from optical propagation to special relativity the optical axis becomes the proper
time axis and the ray direction cosines correspond to the components of the speed vector v. The

δZ (mγ − V ) ds = 0,

δZ (mγ − V ) dτ = 0.

(41)

(42)

Almeida, Optical interpretation. . .

OSA Annual meeting/2008 Page 10

refractive index has no direct homologous; it will be shown that in special relativity we must
consider a non-homogeneous medium with different refractive indices in the spatial and proper
time directions. We can derive the conjugate momentum from the Lagrangian using the standard
procedure:

p =   m−→ν

γ ! = mv.

(44)

Comparing with Eq. (13) it is clear that m is the analogous of the position dependent refractive
index.

The system Hamiltonian can be calculated

=

The canonical equations follow directly from Eq. (15)
−→ν = γv,
dp
dτ

= −gradH,

where the gradient is taken over the spatial coordinates, as usual.

(45)

(46)

The ﬁrst of the equations above is the same as Eq. (40), while the second one can be developed as

d

dτ   m

γ −→ν ! = grad  m

γ − V! .

(47)

Considering that from the quantities inside the gradient only the potential energy should be a
function of the spatial coordinates, we can simplify the second member:

d

dτ   m

γ −→ν ! = −gradV
(mv) = −gradV.

d
dτ

(48)

(49)

Eq. (49) is formally equivalent to the last two Eqs. (19), conﬁrming that the conjugate momentum
components are proportional to world line’s direction cosines in 4-space. The total refractive index
analogue can now be found to be m − V /γ. We can check the validity of Eq. (49) by replacing the
τ derivative by a derivative with respect to t.

d
dt

(mγv) = −gradV,

(50)

where mγ is the relativistic mass and the product mγv is the relativistic momentum.

If the mass is allowed to be coordinate dependent, as a mass distribution through the Universe,
the passage between Eqs. (47) and (48) is illegitimate and we are led to equations similar to Eq.
(19). The consideration of a coordinate dependent mass allows the prediction of worm tubes, the
analogues of optical waveguides, and black holes, which would have optical analogues in high
refractive index glass beads with gradual transition to vacuum refractive index.

5 De Broglie’s wavelength

The formal equivalence between light propagation and special relativity in the x, y, z, τ frame
suggests that de Broglie’s wavelength may be the formal equivalent of light wavelength. We would
like to associate an event’s world line to a light ray and similarly we want to say that, in the absence
of a potential, the event’s world line is the normal to the wavefront at every point in 4-space. We
must start from a basic principle, stating that each particle has an intrinsic frequency related to it’s
mass in a similar way as the wavelength of light is related to the refractive index; we state this
principle by the equation

f =

,

(51)

m
h

where h is Planck’s constant. If we remember that everything is normalized to the speed of light
by c = 1, Eq. (51) is equivalent to a photon’s energy equation

E = hf.

(52)

So we have extended an existing principle to state that any particle has an intrinsic frequency that
is the result of dividing it’s equivalent energy E = mc2 by Planck’s constant.

In the 4-space x, y, z, τ frame a material particle travels in a trajectory with direction cosines
given by the components of v and consistently a photon travels along a spatial direction with zero
component in the τ direction. The intrinsic frequency deﬁned by Eq. (51) originates a wavelength
along the world line given by

where we have temporarily removed the c normalization for clarity reasons.

λw =

,

Fig. 6. The moving particle has a world wavelength λw = h/(mc) and a spatial wavelength λ =
h/(mv).

As shown in Fig. 6, when projected onto 3-space λw deﬁnes a spatial wavelength such that

λ =

λwc
v

=

h
p

.

(53)

(54)

The previous equation deﬁnes a spatial wavelength which is the same as was originally proposed
by de Broglie in the non-relativistic limit. When the speed of light is approached Eq. (54) will
produce a wavelength λ → λw while de Broglie’s predictions use the relativistic momentum and
so λ → ∞ when v → c.

6 Wave propagation and Schr¨odinger equation

The arguments in the previous paragraphs lead us to state the general principle that a particle has
an associated frequency given by Eq. (51) and travels on a world line through 4-space with the
speed of light. In a generalization to wave packets, we will respect the formal similarity with light
propagation and state that all waves travel in 4-space with the speed of light. A particle about
which we know mass and speed but know nothing about its position will be represented by a
monocromatic wave and a moving particle in general will be represented by a wave packet.

According to general optical practice we will say that the ﬁeld must verify the wave equation

 ∇2 −

∂2

∂t2! ϕ(P, t) = 0,

where P is a point in 4-space and ∇2 is an extended laplacian operator

∇2 =

∂2
∂x2 +

∂2
∂y2 +

∂2
∂z2 +

∂2
∂τ 2 .

(55)

(56)

In Eq. (55) we have returned to the c = 1 normalization in order to treat all the coordinates on an
equal footing. Due to the special 4-space metric we will assume that ϕ(P, t) is of the form

ϕ(P, t) = Φ(P)ei2πf t,

(57)

with f given by Eq. (51). Notice that we used a plus sign in the exponent instead of the minus sign
used in optical propagation; this is due to the special 4-space metric.

Not surprisingly we will ﬁnd that, in the absence of a potential, Eq. (55) can be written in the form
of Helmoltz equation

with

(cid:16)∇2 + k2(cid:17) Φ(P) = 0,

k =

Eq. (63) retains the symbol P representing a point in 4-space. It must be noted, though, that in a
non-relativistic situation τ → t and we can say that ϕ(P, t) → ϕ(P, t) with P having the 3-space
coordinates of P.
In the presence of a potential we have to consider that momentum is no longer preserved, as shown
by Eq. (49). This can be taken into account when we evaluate the laplacian in Eq. (62) by the
inclusion of an extra term −V ϕ(P, t). We will the end up with the Schr¨odinger equation in a
potential.

7 Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle

For the pair of associated variables x and px, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that there is
an uncertainty governed by the relation

∆x∆px ≥

¯h
2

.

(64)

The interpretation of the uncertainty principle is that the best we know a particle’s position, the
least we know about its momentum and vice-versa; the product of the position and momentum
distribution widths is a small number multiplied by Planck’s constant. An application of the uncer-
tainty relationship is usually found in the diffraction of a particle by an aperture.

If we assume that the localization of a particle with momentum px can be done with an aperture of
width ∆x, we can use Fraunhofer diffraction theory to say that further along the way the probability
of ﬁnding the particle with any particular value of it’s momentum will be given by the square of the
aperture Fourier transform, considering de Broglie’s relationship for the translation of momentum
into wavelength.

A rectangular aperture of width ∆x has a Fourier transform given by

A(fx) = ∆x sinc(∆xfx),

(65)

where sinc is the usual sin(x)/x function.

Considering de Broglie’s relationship given by Eq. (54), making fx = 1/λ and the fact that the
Fourier transform must be squared we can write

P (px) = ∆x2 sinc2(cid:18)∆xpx
h (cid:19) .

(66)

The second member on the previous equation has its ﬁrst minimum for ∆xpx/h = π and so we
can say that the spread in momentum is governed by ∆x∆px = πh and Eq. (64) is veriﬁed.

If we accept that wave packets propagate in 4-space at the speed of light and that the momentum
is given by Eq. (44), there is a upper limit to the modulus of the momentum |p| ≤ mc. In the
propagation of light rays we found a similar limitation as |p| ≤ n with the results in light diffraction
exempliﬁed by Eq. (32) and Fig. 3. It is expected that the same effects will be present in particle
diffraction and in fact Figs. 2 and 3 could also represent the diffraction of a stationary particle by
an aperture with width equal to λw. The strong peak about half one wavelength in front of the
aperture shows that the particle is localized in a region considerably smaller than its wavelength
and, above all, shows the inexistence of higher order peaks.

8 Conclusions

Special relativity was shown to be formally equivalent to light propagation, provided the time axis
is replaced by the proper time. In this coordinate set all particles follow w world line at the speed
of light and can be assumed to have an intrinsic frequency given by mc2/h. Quantum mechanics is
then a projection of 4-space wave propagation into 3-space. Important conclusions were possible
through the analogy with light propagation and diffraction.

It was possible to derive Schr¨odinger equation and it was shown that Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle may be violated in special cases in the very close range, similarly to what had already
been shown to happen in light diffraction.1

Future work will probably allow the derivation of relativistic quantum mechanics conclusions,
through the use of the Wigner Distribution Function for the prediction of wave packet propagation
in 4-space.

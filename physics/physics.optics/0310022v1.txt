Radiation pressure forces in a focussed laser beam can be used to trap microscopic absorbing
particles against a substrate. Calculations based on momentum transfer considerations show that
stable trapping occurs before the beam waist, and that trapping is more eﬀective with doughnut
beams. Such doughnut beams can transfer angular momentum leading to rotation of the trapped
particles. Energy is also transferred, which can result in heating of the particles to temperatures
above the boiling point of the surrounding medium.

INTRODUCTION

The availability of lasers has enabled the observation
of forces due to light interacting with microscopic ob-
jects.
In 1970, Ashkin [1] reported optical trapping of
micrometre sized spheres using two opposing laser beams,
and by 1980 [2] had proposed many experiments us-
ing focused laser beams, and discussed widely varying
possible applications, including automatic force measure-
ment, particle size measurement using surface wave reso-
nances in scattering particles, a modiﬁed Millikan exper-
iment, measurement of radiometric forces, and separa-
tion and manipulation of biological particles. In 1986 [3]
the single-beam gradient optical trap, or optical tweezers
was ﬁrst demonstrated. Optical tweezers can be used for
three-dimensional manipulation of transparent particles
around 1–100 µm in diameter, or other small particles
which behave as reactive dipoles.

The single-beam gradient optical trap consists of a sin-
gle laser beam, tightly focused to create a very strong
ﬁeld gradient both radially and axially, which acts on
polarisable particles to cause a dipole force. Polarisable
particles are attracted to the strongest part of the ﬁeld,
at the beam focus, due to the gradient force. A scatter-
ing force results from momentum transfer to the particle
when light is scattered by it. Under the right conditions
the gradient force can balance the scattering and gravity
forces, to trap particles three-dimensionally in the laser
beam. If the laser beam is not tightly focused, the axial
component of the gradient force will be weak, and only
radial trapping will be possible [1, 4].

A practical optical tweezers setup usually consists of
a laser beam with a power of a few hundred mW, intro-
duced into a microscope and focused using a high nu-
merical aperture 100
objective lens. Both conventional
upright and inverted microscopes are used, the inverted
microscope providing stronger axial trapping due to the
scattering force opposing gravity.

The ability to manipulate transparent particles of
size 1–100 µm in a closed sterile environment has been

exploited by researchers in the biological sciences, to
move [5], isolate [6, 7], cut (using UV beams, where bio-
logical specimens are highly absorbing) [8], and perform
surgery on cells [9] and to do various forms of analysis.
The very high intensity region at the beam focus can be
used for two photon spectroscopy, which enables analysis
of very thin sections of a sample, since the high inten-
sity region is extremely localised [10]. Using calibrated
forces from optical tweezers, it is also possible to measure
physical properties of specimens, such as the compliance
of bacterial ﬂagella [11], mechanical properties of a sin-
gle protein motor [12] and tube-like motion of a single
polymer chain [13].

Although the particles normally trapped with optical
tweezers are highly transparent, there is usually some
absorption occurring. Studies have been made of the
wavelength dependence of the heating of specimens and
the ability of live specimens to remain viable after having
been trapped [14, 15, 16].

Svoboda and Block [17] reported that small metallic
Rayleigh particles with sizes on the order of tens of nm
can be trapped using dipole forces. However when the ab-
sorptivity of micron-sized particles becomes high enough,
radiation pressure becomes much greater than the gradi-
ent force, and they can no longer be trapped using dipole
forces. These absorbing particles are then aﬀected pri-
marily by radiation pressure, whereby the momentum of
the absorbed light is transferred to the particle. The mo-
mentum of the light ﬁeld is normal to the wavefronts, so
if the curvature of the wavefront is such that the result-
ing force can be resolved into a radially inward force and
a force in the direction of beam propagation, then par-
ticles constrained in the direction of beam propagation
(e.g. by a glass microscope slide as in Figure 1) can be
trapped two-dimensionally.

Trapping of micron-sized reﬂective particles has been
modelled in a similar way [18]. On the basis of ray op-
tics, a totally reﬂective particle can be shown to be ra-
dially constrained when located before the beam focus.
However, the forces produced by reﬂection are depen-

In this paper we review the work performed on absorb-
ing particles. Both Gaussian and Laguerre–Gauss modes
are commonly used. We outline a model for the trap-
ping of absorbing particles for these beam types based
on the eﬀects of transfer of momentum from the beam to
the particle. We also consider in some detail the heating
eﬀects.

FIG. 2: Basic experimental setup for laser tweezers. A
dichroic mirror is used to direct the beam into the objec-

tion, between a glass microscope slide and a coverslip. An
oil-immersion objective is used for low distortion and tight
focussing of the beam. The laser beam is expanded to ﬁll the
objective in order to produce the smallest spot and largest
intensity gradient to ensure optimal trapping.

The most commonly used experimental set up (de-
picted in Figure 2) for the single beam optical trap is
optimised for trapping transparent particles and con-
sists of a laser light source directed into a port of
an optical microscope [25]. A variety of lasers can
be used for trapping, ranging from He-Ne lasers, CW
NdYAG lasers, Ti Sapphire, Ar ion lasers to diode laser
sources [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. A single mode
laser beam is introduced into the microscope in such a
way as not to interfere with normal microscope function.
It is brought to a tight focus at (or near) the specimen
plane, usually with a high numerical aperture (NA

objective lens. As microscope optics
are designed to minimise aberrations near the specimen
plane, arranging the optics in such a way that the trap
is parfocal with the specimen allows trapped objects to
be visualised and improves the quality of the trap. High
numerical aperture is essential to maximise the light in-
tensity gradient near the focal plane and ensure stable
trapping in the axial direction. The diameter of the
laser beam is normally expanded just before being in-
troduced into the microscope using a set of appropriate

dent on the angle at which the laser light impinges on
the particle. Trapping of absorbing particles is much less
dependent on particle geometry as the radiation force is
perpendicular to the wavefront and independent of the
orientation of the particle surface.
In experiments on
the trapping of microscopic reﬂective particles, heating
eﬀects such as bubble formation and radiometric forces
were observed [18], indicating a noticeable absorption ef-
fect, so absorption of linear momentum also contributes
to the trapping forces acting on these particles.

Using such transfer of linear momentum, absorbing
particles such as zinc dust [19], CuO particles [20] and
ceramic powder [21, 22] have been trapped and manipu-
lated. The laser beam used in most of these experiments
was equivalent to a Gauss–Laguerre LG03 mode, a dough-
nut beam. When a doughnut beam is used for trapping,
the laser intensity is concentrated in a ring of light: this
means that the radiation force along the beam axis is less
than for a TEM00 mode, and the radiation trapping is
comparatively stronger.

As well as linear momentum, angular momentum is
transferred from light to absorbing particles during trap-
ping. Both orbital angular momentum due to the helical
wavefront of a LG03 mode [19, 21, 23] and spin angular
momentum due to the polarisation of the light [19, 23, 24]
have been observed to set particles into rotation.

lenses. This is done in order to ensure exactly ﬁlling, or
somewhat over-ﬁlling the back pupil of the objective lens.
In this way minimum focal spot size and maximum in-
tensity gradient, and hence the strongest trapping force
on an object to be trapped and manipulated is achieved.
The expanded beam is deﬂected to the objective by a
dichroic mirror. The spot size of the laser beam is of the
order of 1–2 µm at the focal plane of the microscope.

Particles to be trapped are placed between a micro-
scope slide and coverslip. Depending on the type of par-
ticle, the solution in which they are kept varies (water,
kerosene etc). The optical trapping is observed using a
CCD camera mounted on the microscope.

In most experiments the trap has to be moved with re-
spect to the specimen. This can be done by either moving
the specimen or by moving the beam [34]. A specimen
can be positioned in the xy-plane by moving the micro-
scope stage in the conventional way, leaving the trap ﬁxed
on the optic axis. When small precise displacements are
needed, the sample can be mounted on an xy piezoelec-
tric stage which is computer controlled. Movement of the
trap in the z-direction (depth) is achieved by focusing the
microscope up or down, taking advantage of the parfocal-
ity of the trap and specimen. The z-direction movement
can also be made in extra ﬁne steps if either the sample
or the objective is placed on a vertical piezoelectric ele-
ment. A change in the vertical position of the trap with
respect to the specimen plane can be achieved by mov-
ing an external lens which controls the beam divergence.
A large number of experiments involving the trapping of
transparent objects with refractive indices higher than
the surrounding medium have been performed using the
above described set-up [for reviews, see [35, 36, 37, 38]].
For transparent (non-absorbing) objects, the strongest
trapping is achieved at the beam waist which is near the
object plane of the microscope lens and therefore trapped
particles are in focus when viewed. The forces acting
on the trapped particle have been studied by calibrating
against viscous drag exerted by ﬂuid ﬂow using escape-
force methods [25, 26, 29, 39, 40, 41]. The force can also
be measured as a function of displacement from the trap
centre. In this way, the trap stiﬀness, when the particle in
a single-beam gradient optical trap is modelled as a mass
in a 3-D (ellipsoidal) harmonic potential well [42, 43, 44],
can be determined.

low beam—an intensity minimum surrounded by bright
circle. Successful trapping was obtained with a particle
being conﬁned in the intensity minimum region of the
beam [45].
It has been also demonstrated that optical
levitation of metal particles could be obtained using a
TEM∗

01 mode laser beam [4].

Recently, we have shown in a series of experiments
that two-dimensional optical trapping of highly absorb-
ing particles can be achieved using a Gauss–Laguerre
LG03 mode laser beam [20, 21, 22, 44]. In these experi-
ments, particles were trapped against a microscope slide
in the converging beam before the waist where the ra-
dial component of momentum at any position is directed
radially inwards.

B. Doughnut beams

Beams of this type contain a phase singularity which
is deﬁned as a point in an optical ﬁeld around which
the phase of the ﬁeld changes by an integer multiple of
2π. The integer is denoted by l and called the topolog-
ical charge of the phase singularity. The charge l is the
azimuthal mode index of a Gauss–Laguerre beam. At
the singularity the phase is undeﬁned and it appears as
a dark spot on a bright background. Beams containing
phase singularities can be produced in a variety of ways
such as by transformation of Hermite–Gaussian modes,
or using cooperative mode locking of a laser. We have
shown earlier that beams containing phase singularities
can be conveniently produced using computer generated
holograms with high eﬃciency [22]. A phase singularity
hologram is similar to a grating except that it has a de-
fect in the centre of the pattern. Using computer graphic
techniques, a blazed interference pattern with a central
defect can be produced. This is followed by photoreduc-
tion of the pattern onto a ﬁlm which results in an am-
plitude hologram. The photoreduced patterns are con-
tact printed onto a holographic plate and the developed
plate is bleached to produce a phase hologram of high
eﬃciency. In this way we can produce holograms with
diﬀerent order phase singularities. Angular momentum
is associated with the helical structure of the wave sur-
rounding a singularity so that a linearly polarised beam
with a charge l singularity will carry angular momentum
¯hl per photon.

It was considered for some time, that a strongly ab-
sorbing particle with a high complex index of refraction
should be impossible to trap using a Gaussian beam.
Such a particle would be pushed out of the beam. There-
fore, in a number of experiments hollow beams of diﬀer-
ent types have been used to achieve trapping of absorbing
or reﬂecting particles. In one of the experiments the trap-
ping was achieved by scanning a beam in a circle using
galvanometer mirrors and in this way producing a hol-

C. Transfer of angular momentum

In our experiments using an optical tweezers set-up,
only slightly modiﬁed compared to the conventional sys-
tem described above, we have shown that using phase
singular ﬁelds we can not only trap absorbing particles
but also set them into rotation. This demonstrates the
transfer of the angular momentum from the light beam
to the particles.

The purpose of our experiments was to unambiguously
demonstrate transfer of angular momentum, evaluate the
resulting rotation speed of the particles and investigate
the relationship of the angular momentum associated
with the helical structure of the beam to that associated
with circular polarisation.

The transfer of angular momentum from light to an
absorbing particle can be understood by considering that
the light torque arises from the angular momentum car-
ried by photons. The Gauss–Laguerre modes are eigen-
modes of the angular momentum operator Lz and as such
have an orbital angular momentum ¯hl per photon. If the
Gauss–Laguerre mode is circularly polarised we can then
also assign it spin angular momentum of σz¯h per photon,
where σz is
1 (or zero for linear polarisation). So, in
a paraxial approximation, considering the total number
of photons absorbed per second, the torque due to both
the polarisation and the helical Poynting vector of the
Gauss–Laguerre mode is given by

±

Γ =

(l + σz)

Pabs
ω

where Pabs is the power absorbed by the particle and ω
is the frequency of light. Barnett and Allen [46] have de-
veloped a general nonparaxial theory according to which
the torque will be given by

Γ =

Pabs
ω

(cid:26)

(l + σz) + σz

(2)

2p + l + 1

2kzr (cid:27)

where k is the wave number, p and l are the radial and
azimuthal mode indices and zr is a length term, which in
the paraxial limit is associated with the Rayleigh range.
However it can be shown that the mixed term in the
above equation becomes signiﬁcant only when the beam
is very strongly focused. Even in the experimental situ-
ation, when the Gauss–Laguerre LG03 mode is used and
is focused to approximately 2 µm size waist, the contri-
bution of this term can be neglected.

The experimental set-up we used for studies of trap-
ping of absorbing particles is similar to the one described
in the earlier part of this paper with only a few modiﬁ-
cations: a Gaussian TEM00 beam from a 17 mW He–Ne
laser is passed through a computer generated phase holo-
gram, which produces a Gauss–Laguerre LG03 mode in
the far ﬁeld. This plane polarised, helical doughnut beam
is then introduced in the usual way into the microscope
(see Figure 3).

The trapping of absorbing particles was performed us-
ing irregular black ceramic particles and CuO particles
dispersed in kerosene. We have also trapped slightly ab-
sorbing latex spheres which were in clumps so that their
rotation could be more easily observed.

We found that most eﬃcient trapping was achieved
with the particles slightly above the focal plane of the
doughnut beam. A variety of experiments was per-
formed. Firstly, trapping and rotation could be observed
using a CCD camera ﬁtted to the microscope. In this set

of studies the absorbing particles were trapped when the
hologram of charge 3 was placed in the beam. A particle
was trapped and observed to rotate. The rotation could
be observed for a long period of time. Subsequently the
hologram was moved sideways so that the particle was il-
luminated by a Gaussian beam and stopped rotating. As
the hologram used here is blazed the sign of the doughnut
can be simply reversed by turning the hologram around.
In principle, on the reversal of the hologram, the particle
should rotate in the opposite direction. However, in the
process of turning the hologram, the particle is no longer
trapped and so on the reversal of the hologram, it is not
certain that the retrapped particle is the same as before.
It is, however, certain that on the reversal of the holo-
gram, all of the trapped particles rotate in the opposite
direction. Another method of reversing the helicity of
the doughnut beam is to introduce a Dove prism into the
beam path between the hologram and the microscope. As
the beam undergoes one reﬂection in the prism, its helic-
ity is reversed and the prism can be adjusted in such a
way so that the beam will be undeviated. With the Dove
prism in the beam path, we now trap the particle, de-
tect its direction of rotation and then quickly remove the
Dove prism so that the same particle is still trapped. The
direction of rotation is reversed [19, 47]. The sequence of
events is recorded and reproduced frame by frame (see
Figure 4).

This method of detection has serious limitations, as
particles move out of clear focus when they are trapped
and so their images are not well deﬁned on video. In the
second set of experiments the experimental set-up was
reﬁned in two ways. Firstly, a quarter-wave plate was

5

polarised light). It was established that the power output
varied less than 1% between diﬀerent polarisations. Care
was taken to position the λ/4 plate in such a way as not
to cause any deﬂection of the beam when the plate was
rotated. The sample of absorbing CuO particles of sizes
up to 20 µm in kerosene was placed between a glass mi-
croscope slide and coverslip. A particle was trapped into
the linearly polarised helical doughnut and the λ/4 plate
rotated ﬁrstly to right circular polarisation, back to lin-
ear and then to left circular polarisation. The signal was
sampled at 20 Hz for a period of 100 s. The sequence was
repeated and the reﬂected light monitored on the pho-
todetector. An example of the spectrum resulting from
this experiment is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen from
this ﬁgure that rotation frequency increases when the he-
licity of the electric ﬁeld vector has the same direction as
the helicity of the Poynting vector and decreases when
these directions are opposite to each other.

introduced into the beam path directly before the 100
×
microscope objective (NA= 1.3) which, as before, focused
the doughnut beam to a waist size of approximately 2 µm
in diameter. The purpose of this experiment was to allow
a precise measurement of the rotation speed and also to
study the inﬂuence of the added circular polarisation of
the beam by which the theoretical prediction of the total
transfer of angular momentum could be veriﬁed.

A second reﬁnement was made to allow for precise mea-
surement of the rotation frequency. The rotation was this
time measured using a photodetector positioned oﬀ cen-
tre to detect a portion of the light reﬂected from the ro-
tating particle. The particles are irregularly shaped and
the protruding parts of the particles reﬂect a “ﬂash” of
light onto the displaced detector. The signal of intensity
ﬂuctuations over time obtained from the photodetector
is Fourier transformed yielding the rotation frequency of
the particle. The modiﬁed experimental set-up for the
above experiments is shown in Figure 3.

The sequence of the experiment is as follows. The LG03
beam enters the microscope.
It passes through a λ/4
plate and its focus is adjusted to be slightly below the
focal point of the microscope. The polarisation state is
checked after the objective lens by an analyser and the
power of the beam is monitored for each position of the
plate (left and right-circularly polarised light and linearly

polarised right-helical, and right-circularly polarised right-
helical doughnut beam respectively. The peak at (d) is the 4th
set of data, taken with left-circularly polarised right-helical
light, in order to verify that this rotation rate did not vary
during the experiment. The particle’s rotation rates are ap-
proximately in the ratio 2:3:4.

Using an LG03 doughnut the theoretical prediction is
that the frequencies should scale as 2:3:4 when going from
opposite helicity Poynting vector and spin to linearly po-
larised helical wave front through to the same helicities.
This was veriﬁed experimentally (see Figure 5).

Recently a somewhat similar experiment has been per-
formed by Simpson et al. [23] using a charge one Gauss–
Laguerre laser mode produced by operating a laser in a
Hermite–Gaussian mode and converting the output into
the corresponding Gauss–Laguerre mode using a cylindri-

6

tween radiation and matter. For highly absorbing parti-
cles, eﬀects such as induced polarisation within the parti-
cle, refraction and Doppler shifts which are important for
transparent particles and atoms can be neglected. The
properties of the trap depend mainly on the properties of
the trapping beam, which will be assumed to be parax-
ial. While a non-paraxial beam is necessary for laser
trapping, the use of the paraxial approximation does not
seem to introduce excessive error. Errors due to aberra-
tion within the optical system are expected to be greater.
The theory will be developed in terms of the two
most common types of beams used for trapping particles,
namely TEM00 Gaussian beams [denoted (G)] and LGpl
Laguerre–Gaussian “doughnut” beams [denoted (LG)]
described by a radial mode index p and an azimuthal
mode index l.

A. The transfer of linear momentum and orbital
angular momentum

We begin with consideration of the transfer of linear
momentum to an absorbing inﬁnitesimal element. This
microscopic behaviour can then be extended to the par-
ticle as a whole. In the course of this, it can be seen that
the transfer of orbital angular momentum from a helical
beam to a particle is a simple radiation pressure process
involving the transfer of linear momentum to diﬀerent
portions of the particle. Due to the spatial structure of
the helical beam, this results in a transfer of angular mo-
mentum.

Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the beam, it is con-
venient to use a cylindrical coordinate system, with ra-
dial, azimuthal and axial coordinates r, φ, and z, and cor-
responding unit vectors ˆr, ˆφ, and ˆz. The linear momen-
tum ﬂux of a laser beam is given by the time-averaged
Poynting vector S (in cylindrical coordinates) [48]:

cal lens mode converter. A quarter-wave plate was used
to change polarisation. The authors showed that spin
¯h per photon associated with
angular momentum of
circularly polarised light can add to, or subtract from,
the orbital angular momentum and observed the mutual
cancellation of the spin and orbital angular momentum.
Their results conﬁrm the results obtained by our group
and show that the LG01 mode of charge 1 has a well-
deﬁned orbital angular momentum corresponding to ¯h
per photon.

In our most recent experiments we have shown that an
absorbing particle can in fact be trapped by a Gaussian
beam. Two-dimensional trapping can be achieved before
the waist of a tightly focused Gaussian beam, where the
spot size is rapidly changing, against a surface such as
a microscope slide, using radiation pressure. The par-
ticle was ﬁrst trapped using linearly polarised Gaussian
beam and subsequently by turning a λ/4 plate a circu-
larly polarised Gaussian beam was used to trap the parti-
cle resulting in a rotation of this particle. When the λ/4
plate was rotated to produce circularly polarised light of
the opposite sense, the particle reversed the direction of
rotation. Successive frames from a video demonstrating
trapping are shown in Figure 6.

FIG. 7: Spatial dependence of optical force on an absorbing particle. The radial and axial variation of the optical force is
shown for both a TEM00 Gaussian beam and an LG03 Laguerre–Gaussian beam. Both beams have the same power (1 mW),
spot size (2 µm) and wavenumber (free space wavelength 632.8 nm). The particle has a circular cross-section of radius 1 µm.
Due to the cylindrical symmetry, there is no azimuthal variation of the force. The beam is propagating in the +z direction,
with the beam waist at z = 0.

The transfer of momentum from the beam to an ab-
sorbing particle is therefore straightforward compared
to other cases, such as transparent particles and atoms.
For transparent particles, refraction and induced polar-
isation must be taken into account. For an atom, the
frequency dependence of the absorption and spontaneous
emission must be considered, while for an absorbing par-
ticle, the absorption can be assumed to be independent
of frequency, and inter-atomic collision rates within the
particle can be assumed to be high enough to cause de-
excitation without re-emission.

C. Macroscopic eﬀects

As particles typically are suﬃciently large that the
Poynting vector of the laser beam is not constant over
their absorbing surfaces, it is necessary to integrate the
Poynting vector over the surface. This requires knowl-
edge of the geometry of the particle and the beam. This
calculation can be readily performed numerically by di-
viding the particle into a number of small area elements
dA over which the Poynting vector is approximately con-
stant, and integrating equation (10). Where the prod-
dA) < 0, the particle will not be illuminated,
uct S

so such regions can be neglected. A useful and simple
approximation is to simply represent the particle as a
disk with the same cross-section (essentially applying the
paraxial approximation to the illumination of the parti-
cle). The resultant force on a particle is shown in Fig-
ure 7.

Equilibrium points in these force ﬁelds exist only where
the force is zero, and a particle can be trapped only at
a stable equilibrium point. Thus, it can be readily seen
that a particle cannot be axially trapped without an ex-
ternal force (such as gravity, viscous drag due to convec-
tion, or a reaction force due to the particle resting on
the bottom of the trapping cell) acting on it. The par-
ticle can be trapped radially in the portion of the beam
which is converging towards the beam waist. The particle
cannot be trapped after the beam waist, as the conver-
gence of the beam required for trapping no longer exists.
The absorbing particle trap can therefore be considered
to be a two-dimensional trap. Also, it should be noted
that in the case of Laguerre–Gaussian beams, angular
momentum is transferred to the particle as a whole, al-
though microscopically only linear momentum is seen to
be present.

The relative eﬃciencies of trapping absorbing particles
using Gaussian beams and doughnut beams can be mea-
sured in terms of the ratio of the radial force to the axial
force. As can be seen from Figure 8, the doughnut beam
trap has smaller axial forces for trapped particles.

FIG. 8: Eﬃciencies of trapping beams. The eﬃciency of the
trap can be measured by the ratio of the radial force to the
axial force. These ratios are calculated here for beams of
waist size 2 µm and power of 1 mW. The particle has a radius
of 1 µm and is in a plane 30 µm before the waist.

As the force acting on a particle at any position within
the beam can be calculated, the overall properties of the
trap, such as the trapping force, or the motion of trapped
particles can be determined. If particles are conﬁned to a
two-dimensional plane in which they are radially trapped,
particles trapped in Gaussian beams are pushed into the
centre of the trap, while particles trapped in Laguerre–
Gaussian beams also tend to orbit about the beam axis
due to the azimuthal component of the force. This orbital
motion can lead to instability in the trap, as a particle
undergoing such motion will only remain within the trap

FIG. 9: Spatial dependence of torque parallel to beam axis on absorbing particle. The torque experienced by a 1 µm radius
particle through absorption of a combination of spin and orbital angular momentum is shown for both a Gaussian TEM00 beam
and a left-helical LG03 doughnut beam. In all cases, the beams have a waist size of 2 µm, a power of 1 mW, and a free space
wavelength of 632.8 nm. Other components of the torque will be much smaller.

if the radial force can provide a centripetal force suﬃcient
to force the path to become circular. If the viscosity of
the surrounding medium is too low, the terminal orbit
speed will be high enough so that the radial force will
be unable to provide the necessary centripetal accelera-
tion and the particle will escape from the trap. Particles
trapped in ﬂuids such as water or kerosene, however, have
very low terminal speeds and can be trapped.

IV. TRANSFER OF SPIN ANGULAR
MOMENTUM

As seen above, any orbital angular momentum present
in a helical laser beam (for example, a Laguerre–Gaussian
beam) is transferred to a particle by the same mecha-
nisms as linear momentum. All laser beams, however,
can carry angular momentum if the beam is circularly
polarised, with each photon having angular momentum
of magnitude ¯h. The rate of absorption of angular mo-
mentum by a small section of the particle is given in
terms of the Poynting vector S and the wavenumber k

The total torque on the particle due to polarisation
can then be found by integrating equation (11) over the
absorbing surface of the particle (see Figure 9). The rota-
tional behaviour of particles trapped in a Gaussian beam
is straightforward. However, that of a particle illumi-
nated by a Laguerre–Gaussian beam is more complex,
due to the presence of the orbital angular momentum.
In practice a particle is trapped on the beam axis. The

The rotation rate for particles trapped in a Gaussian
beam rises as the particles become small. When the spin
rate becomes large, equation (16) will cease to be appli-
cable. For particles trapped in the doughnut beam, the
rotation rate is maximum for a particle large enough to
absorb most of the beam, but small enough to keep the
drag surface area small.

In a typical experiment, ceramic particles with radii
of about 2 µm, suspended in kerosene, were trapped in a
beam of 4 mW power and a width of 1.75 µm. Rotation
rates of 1–2 Hz were observed (see Figure 5), consistent
with the predictions of equation (18) and Figure 10.

FIG. 10: Spin rates of trapped absorbing particles trapped
in kerosene. A (two-dimensionally) trapped particle will ex-
perience a torque dependent on its size and the beam power.
This torque will depend on the position along the beam axis
where the particle is trapped and on the direction of circular
polarisation of the beam. The beams here are of width 2 µm
and power 1 mW. The three cases for particles trapped by a
LG03 doughnut beam are shown by: (a) circular polarisation
and helicity in the same direction, (b) plane polarisation, and
(c) circular polarisation and helicity in opposite directions.

V. ABSORPTION OF ENERGY

The energy density in a focussed beam of even mod-
est power can be very large. For example, in a 1 mW
beam focussed to a 1 µm waist, the irradiance will ex-
ceed 109 W/m2. The transparent objects convention-
ally trapped by optical tweezers evidently absorb very
little, partly because they are very thin, and they are
surrounded by a conducting medium so experience only
modest rises in temperature. Indeed, it has been shown
that bacteria will survive and even reproduce while
trapped.

The situation for strongly absorbing particles is very
diﬀerent. A typical 1 µm radius particle absorbing 1 mW
will, in the absence of any losses, experience a temper-
ature rise of order 108 K/s. Clearly, the temperature of
a trapped particle will rise rapidly and it is necessary to
consider what losses will limit the rise.

Since the surface area is small, even neglecting local ab-
sorption in the surrounding medium, the amount of heat
which can be radiated is limited. Stefan’s Law shows
that a particle of 1 µm radius needs to have a surface
temperature in excess of 1000 K before the power radi-
ated exceeds 1 µW. The small surface area also severely
limits the rate at which heat can be exchanged with the
surrounding ﬂuid.

If we consider a spherical particle in equilibrium losing
the heat absorbed from the beam by isotropic conduction
into a surrounding medium of thermal conductivity k, the
radial variation of the temperature T in the surrounding
medium can easily be shown to be given by

T =

+ T0

Pa
4πrk

(19)

where Pa is the total power absorbed by the particle from
the beam and T0 is the ambient temperature. The ab-
sorbed power for a particle with absorption coeﬃcient α
trapped on the beam axis of a TEM00 Gaussian or LG0l
Laguerre-Gaussian beam of power P is given by

Calculated equilibrium temperatures reached by typi-

Quite high temperatures are predicted, especially for

particle sizes on the order of the spot size.

Convection is another possible means of heat loss. The
importance of convection can be found in terms of the
mean Nusselt number ¯N u, which, at low ﬂow rates, is
given in terms of the Prandtl number P r (the ratio be-
tween the momentum and thermal diﬀusivities) and the

FIG. 11: Temperature rise of trapped particles. The tempera-

of 1 mW and a width of 2 µm where the particle is trapped.
Small particles absorb little energy from the beam while very
large particles lose signiﬁcantly more heat through conduction
due to their large surface area.

and the Prandtl number by

where cp is the speciﬁc heat of the ﬂuid, η is the dynamic
viscosity and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

For a temperature diﬀerence of 100 K and an ambient
temperature of 300 K, and a particle diameter of D =
3 µm (at which size high temperatures are reached for a
10−4 for water and ¯N u =
typical beam), ¯N u = 2 + 3
×
10−5 for kerosene, values which are very close to
2 + 7
¯N u = 2 for pure conduction. The convective contribution
to the cooling is therefore negligible.

×

We are therefore driven to the conclusion that even in
the presence of a liquid medium, an absorbing particle
will experience a large rise in temperature, probably lim-
ited by thermal conduction. Note that due to the 1/r
dependence of the temperature rise in that case, the vol-
ume where elevated temperatures will be found is quite
small which means in turn that the thermal relaxation
time will be short, so that the temperature rises will be
diﬃcult to measure.

However, we do have evidence of such large tempera-
ture rises. In experiments where we trapped small parti-
cles of photocopy toner, we observed that initially jagged
fragments almost instantly became smooth when irradi-
ated by a beam with a power of a few mW. According to

the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations, the fusing point of the
toner is 185°C. These results are at ﬁrst rather surprising
as it might have been expected that boiling of the liquid
would enhance cooling or disrupt the trapping process.
Sometimes, with beam powers well in excess of that re-
quired to melt toner, a bubble is generated but it is not
clear if this is vapour or merely absorbed gases being
evolved from the particle. The boiling process in general
is a somewhat mysterious one and it is widely accepted
that bubble formation requires some seed to overcome
surface tension forces which scale inversely as the radius.
Therefore it cannot be taken for granted that normally
observed behaviour will scale to very small dimensions. If
so, further study of superheated particles may help shed
new light on the fundamentals of the boiling process.

12

Stirring and convection eﬀects have both been ob-
served when CuO particles were trapped, using a dough-
nut beam, in water to which a little detergent had been
added. This greatly reduced the tendency of particles to
stick to the slide and generally freed up their motion so
that Brownian motion was more evident. When a par-
ticle was trapped, others in its vicinity began to move
toward it, presumably as a result of a convection cur-
rents, and began to circle around the trapped particle
in the same direction as its rotation, presumably carried
around by a ﬂow generated by the rotation of the trapped
particle. The ﬂuid velocities of the order of 10 µm/s are
too small to signiﬁcantly aﬀect heat transport.

VII. CONCLUSION

VI.

INTERACTION WITH THE MEDIUM

Interactions with the surrounding transparent medium
include the heating of the medium through conduction
from the absorbing particle, and the generation of ﬂuid
motions through stirring and convection currents.

Temperature changes in the medium will be localised
to within 100 µm of the particle but could aﬀect prop-
erties such as the refractive index and viscosity.
It is
also possible that thermophoretic eﬀects may occur in
the strong temperature gradients formed.

It has been shown that the converging section of a
focussed laser beam can radially trap absorbing parti-
cles against a supporting substrate using a Gaussian or
doughnut beam. Doughnut beams with phase singular-
ities carry angular momentum which is also transferred
to the trapped particle causing it to rotate. Angular mo-
mentum resulting from circular polarisation of the light
can also be transferred. Energy absorbed from the beam
can lead to rapid heating and high equilibrium tempera-
tures, even well in excess of the normal boiling point of
the surrounding medium.

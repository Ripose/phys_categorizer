Probability Density Function of

Kerr Eﬀect Phase Noise

StrataLight Communications, Campbell, CA 95008

Keang-Po Ho

kpho@stratalight.com

The probability density function of Kerr eﬀect phase noise, often called the

Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect, is derived analytically. The Kerr eﬀect phase noise

can be accurately modeled as the summation of a Gaussian random variable

and a noncentral chi-square random variable with two degrees of freedom.

Using the received intensity to correct for the phase noise, the residual Kerr

eﬀect phase noise can be modeled as the summation of a Gaussian random

variable and the diﬀerence of two noncentral chi-square random variables

with two degrees of freedom. The residual phase noise can be approximated

by Gaussian distribution better than the Kerr eﬀect phase noise without

correction.

Introduction

Gordon and Mollenauer1 showed that when optical ampliﬁers are used to compensate

for ﬁber loss, the interaction of ampliﬁer noise and the Kerr eﬀect causes phase noise,

often called the Gordon-Mollenauer eﬀect or nonlinear phase noise. By broadening the

1

signal linewidth,2 Kerr eﬀect phase noise degrades both phase-shifted keying (PSK)

and diﬀerential phase-shift keying (DPSK) systems that have renewed attention re-

cently.3, 4, 5 Because the Kerr eﬀect phase noise is correlated with the received inten-

sity, the received intensity can be used to correct the Kerr eﬀect phase noise.6, 7, 8 The

transmission distance can be doubled if the Kerr eﬀect phase noise is the dominant

impairment.6, 8

Usually, the performance of the system is estimated based on the variance of

the Kerr eﬀect phase noise.1, 6, 7, 8 The probability density function (p.d.f.) is required

to better understand the system and evaluates the system performance. This paper

provides an analytical expression of the p.d.f. for the Kerr eﬀect phase noise with6, 7, 8

and without1 the correction by the received intensity. The characteristic functions

are ﬁrst derived analytically and the p.d.f.’s are the inverse Fourier transform of the

characteristic functions.

3. Numerical Results and Random Variable Models

The p.d.f.’s of both φNL (1) and φRES (15) can be calculated by taking the inverse

Fourier transform of the corresponding characteristic functions of ΨφNL(ν) (10) and

ΨφRES(ν) (19), respectively. Fig. 1 shows the p.d.f. of φNL (1) and φRES (15). Fig.

1 is plotted for the case that the optical signal-to-noise ratio ρO = A2/(2Nσ2) =

18, corresponding to an error probability of 10−9 if the ampliﬁer noise is the only

impairment. The number of span is N = 32. The x-axis is normalized with respect to

NA2, approximately equal to the mean Kerr eﬀect phase noise from the Appendix.

Fig. 1 can conﬁrm that using the received intensity to correct for Kerr eﬀect

phase noise, the standard deviation of Kerr eﬀect phase noise can be reduced by a

factor of two.6, 7, 8 The Appendix shows that the variance of nonlinear phase noise can

be reduced by approximately a factor of four.

From the characteristic function of (12), the random variables of both φNL (1) and

φRES (15) can be modeled as the combination of N = 32 independently distributed

7

noncentral χ-square random variables with two degrees of freedom. Some studies1, 6, 7

implicitly assume a Gaussian distribution by using the Q-factor to characterize the

random variables. When many independently distributed random variables with more

or less the same variance are summed (or subtracted) together, the summed random

variable approaches the Gaussian distribution. For the characteristic function of (12),

the Gaussian assumption is valid only if the eigenvalues λk are more or less the same.

From (14), the largest eigenvalue λ1 of the covariance matrix

is about nine times

C

larger than the second largest eigenvalue λ2. From (20), the two largest eigenvalues

λ1 and λ2 of the covariance matrix

Cr are about 5.5 times larger than the third largest
eigenvalue λ3. The approximation of (14) is accurate within 3.2% for N = 32. The

approximation of (20) is not as good as that for (14) and accurate within 10% for

N = 32.

variables.

While the Gaussian assumption for both φNL (1) and φRES (15) may not be valid,

other than the noncentral χ-square random variables with two degrees of freedom

corresponds to some large eigenvalues, the other random variables should sum to

Gaussian distribution. By modeling the summation of random variables with smaller

eigenvalues as Gaussian distribution, the nonlinear phase noise of (12) can be modeled

as a summation of two or three instead of N = 32 independently distributed random

Note that the variance of the noncentral χ-square random variables with two

degrees of freedom in (12) is 4σ4λ2

k +4A2(~vT

k ~w)2.9 While the above reasoning just takes

into account the contribution from the eigenvalue of λk but ignores the contribution

from the eigenvector ~vk, numerical results show that the variance of each individual

8

noncentral χ-square random variable increases with the corresponding eigenvalue of

λk. Later part of this paper also validates the argument.

From Fig. 1, the p.d.f. of φNL has signiﬁcant diﬀerence with that of a Gaussian

distribution. Fig. 2 divides the p.d.f. of φNL into the convolution of two parts. The

ﬁrst part has no observable diﬀerence with a Gaussian p.d.f. and corresponds to the

second largest to the smallest eigenvalues, λk, k = 2, . . . , N, of the characteristic

function (12). The second part is a noncentral χ-square p.d.f. with two degrees of

freedom and corresponds to the largest eigenvalue λ1, where σ2λ1

The p.d.f. of φNL in Fig. 1 is also plotted in Fig. 2 for comparison. The mean and

variance of the ﬁrst part Gaussian random variable are

lines. From Fig. 3, the Gaussian approximation by Q-factor is not accurate, especially

for the tail probability for less than the mean. From Fig. 3, the Kerr eﬀect phase noise

can be modeled very accurately as the summation of a Gaussian random variable and

a noncentral χ-square random variable with two degrees of freedom. From Fig. 2,

the noncentral χ-square random variable with two degrees of freedom corresponding

to λ1 has a very large variance such that the p.d.f. of φLN in Fig. 1 has signiﬁcant

diﬀerence with a Gaussian p.d.f.

Instead of the combination of N = 32 noncentral χ-square random variables

with two degrees of freedom, similar to the decomposition of Fig. 2, the random

variable of φRES can be modeled as the summation of a Gaussian random variable

and the diﬀerence of two noncentral χ-square random variables with two degrees of

freedom. Fig. 4 shows that the p.d.f. of φRES as the convolution of a Gaussian p.d.f.

and two noncentral χ-square p.d.f.’s with two degrees of freedom. The two noncentral

χ-square random variables correspond to the two largest eigenvalues of the covariance

matrix

Cr with more or less the same magnitude but diﬀerent signs. The Gaussian
2 noncentral χ-square random

random variable corresponds to the summation of N

−

variables with two degrees of freedom for the eigenvalues of λ3, . . . , λN . Because the

variance parameter of σ2λ1 is negative, the corresponding random variable in (12) is

the negative of a noncentral χ-square random variable with two degrees of freedom.

The p.d.f. corresponding to λ1 in Fig. 4 is the mirror image of a noncentral χ-square

p.d.f. with two degrees of freedom with respect to the y-axis. The random variable

corresponding to the combined term of both λ1 and λ2 in (12) is the diﬀerence of two

noncentral χ-square random variables with two degrees of freedom.

calculated by numerical integration according to (19) is shown as circle, the model as

the summation of a Gaussian random variable and the diﬀerence of two noncentral

χ-square random variables with two degrees of freedom of Fig. 4 is shown as solid

lines, and the Gaussian assumption1, 6, 7 is shown as dotted lines. From Figs. 1 and 4,

the p.d.f. of φRES resembles a Gaussian p.d.f. with mean and variance from [8]and the

Appendix. The residual Kerr eﬀect phase noise of φRES can be modeled accurately as

a Gaussian random variable, especially for the tail probabilities less than the mean.

Even for the tail probabilities larger than the mean, the Gaussian model for φRES

is better than that for φNL. If the tail probabilities for above 10−5 is for interests,

Gaussian approximation for φRES can be used.

4. Conclusion

The characteristic functions of Kerr eﬀect phase noise, with and without the correction

using the received intensity, are derived analytically as product of N noncentral χ-

square characteristic functions with two degrees of freedom. The p.d.f.’s are calculated

exactly as the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic functions. The p.d.f. of

the Kerr eﬀect phase noise can be modeled as the convolution of a Gaussian p.d.f. and

a noncentral χ-square p.d.f. with two degrees of freedom. Using the received intensity

to correct for the phase noise, the p.d.f. of the residual Kerr eﬀect phase noise can

be modeled accurately as the convolution of a Gaussian p.d.f and two noncentral

11

χ-square p.d.f.’s with two degrees of freedom. The Gaussian approximation of the

residual Kerr eﬀect phase noise is much better than that for Kerr eﬀect phase noise.

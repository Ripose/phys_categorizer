Abstract. We have operated a CW triply resonant OPO using a PPLN crystal
pumped by a Nd:YAG laser at 1.06 µm and generating signal and idler modes in the
2-2.3 µm range. The OPO was operated stably in single mode operation over large
periods of time with a pump threshold as low as 500 µW .

frequency ranges in which usual crystals using birefringence for phase matching were not
very eﬃcient. This was the case for example for the parametric generation of signal and
idler ﬁelds in the 2 - 2.3 µm region using a Nd:YAG laser as a pump, where only critically
phase matched crystals were available : parametric oscillation was reported in this region
only with high peak power pulsed Nd:YAG lasers [1, 2], or in the CW regime using
ultra-low loss devices with internal reﬂection [3]. The availability of periodically poled
LiNbO3 crystals has opened the way to very promising new devices in this frequency
range, which is of particular interest for molecular spectroscopy and LIDAR applications
[4]. Let us quote in particular a pulsed singly resonant OPO [5, 6] with broad tunability
and signiﬁcant output power, and a pump-enhanced singly resonant single mode CW
OPO, with a minimum threshold well below 1 mW [7]. We describe here another device
based on a PPLN crystal, namely a Nd:YAG laser pumped, signal-idler-pump triply
resonant CW OPO working in the region 2-2.3 µm, which has a threshold in the mW
range.

2. Description of the OPO

The nonlinear crystal is a 0.5 mm × 19 mm × 12 mm PPLN from Crystal Technology,
with 8 diﬀerent poling periods ranging from 30 µm to 31.2 µm. It is inserted in a 65 mm
long linear optical cavity closed by two mirrors having a radius of curvature of 30 mm.
This ensures mode waist sizes at the center of the crystal of 36 µm at 1.06 µm and
51 µm at 2 µm, large enough to prevent any losses when the beam crosses the 500 µm
high end faces of the crystal.

The pump source is made of a CW monolithic diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser
(Lightwave 126-1064-700) spatially and frequency ﬁltered using a resonant Fabry-Perot
cavity. This ﬁltering was necessary to ensure that the pump laser is shot-noise limited
above 5 MHz for quantum noise reduction measurements [8] but the OPO could also
be operated without it. A pair of lenses (f = 300 mm and f = 60 mm) assures
a mode matching of the pump beam to the OPO cavity of 97 %. The OPO cavity
input mirror has an intensity reﬂection coeﬃcient of 87% at 1.06 µm and 99.8% in the
range 2-2.2 µm. The output mirror has a reﬂection coeﬃcient of 99.8 at 1.06 µm and
roughly 99% in the range 2-2.2 µm. The end faces of the crystal are anti-reﬂection

coated at both wavelengths (residual reﬂection coeﬃcient : 0.6% at 1.06 µm and 0.5%
in the range 2-2.2 µm). This gives theoretical cavity ﬁnesses of roughly 37 at the pump
frequency and 200 at 2.2 µm. The experimental measurement of the ﬁnesse at 1.06 µm
in conditions where OPO operation was not present gives a ﬁnesse in good agreement
with the theoretical result. It is important to note that our OPO was not designed to
maximize the signal-idler output but rather to optimize the pump squeezing experiment
[9], which requires low pump to signal-idler energy transfers.

3. OPO oscillation characteristics

Figure 1 shows a typical recording of the intensity of light transmitted through the
output mirror respectively at 1.06 µm and around 2 µm, as a function of time when the
cavity length is modiﬁed via a piezoelectric ceramic. Generation of infrared light and
a strong pump depletion are observed when the cavity length is close to a resonance
with the pump frequency. When one uses the 31.1 µm period poled region, and a
crystal heated at 160◦, the oscillation threshold was measured to be below 500 µW .
This ultra-low threshold was limited in cavity length by the pump resonance and was
obtained within 0.5 K around the degeneracy temperature. We have also obtained
OPO oscillation with a period of 30.95 µm. In that case, close to the corresponding
frequency degeneracy temperature (≈ 190◦C), the threshold was similar. The other
paths had very large frequency degeneracy temperatures (above 220◦) which made their
use unpractical.

The infrared signal can be used in a feedback loop to stabilize the intensity of the
OPO. The error signal is obtained using a lock-in ampliﬁer and a modulation of the
cavity length at a frequency of 1 kHz . With this technique, the output power residual
ﬂuctuations are of the order of a few %. We have been able to keep the cavity locked
for a period over 1 hour (ﬁg. 2). The power drift was mostly due to a slow temperature
drift of the crystal.

of the crystal temperature when the cavity length is dithered close to a pump-cavity
resonance. The well known parabolic shape, characteristics of a type I crystal is
obtained, with some extra points lying outside the parabola, especially close to the
degeneracy point. The same kind of behavior has been already observed in CW OPOs
[10]. The explanation is simple : the parabola gives the locus of perfect phase matching
as a function of temperature. The OPO may oscillate at wavelengths that lie in the
neighborhood of this curve, within a range given by the gain bandwidth, and at speciﬁc
values imposed by the signal idler double resonance conditions. As already observed
[10], this range is especially broad in the vicinity of the degeneracy point. As the cavity
length is scanned across pump resonance, the signal and idler modes frequencies emitted
change on a very short range while, for a given length, only one pair of signal/idler
modes is generated. A precise check of the single mode character of our OPO was made
using a high ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot around 2 µm showing mode hops as the OPO cavity
length was scanned, the beat note frequency change between mode hops corresponding
to the free spectral range of the OPO cavity.
It is important to note that close to
degeneracy, as long as the pump intensity is suﬃcient (i.e. within a pump resonance),
there is oscillation at any cavity length. This is in contrast with the case of the type-II
OPO where oscillation takes place only in small cavity lengths intervals around lengths
corresponding to the exact double resonance condition.

The upper curve of Figure 4 gives the experimental value of the OPO oscillation
threshold, which is equal to 5 mW close to degeneracy, and increases to 40 mW for the
signal-idler couple (2.25µm-2.00µm ). The lower curve gives the theoretical expectation,

corresponding to the formula [11]:

where Tp, Lp, Ts, Ls, Ti, Li are the intensity transmission and loss coeﬃcients for the
pump signal and idler modes respectively, and χ the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient
taking into account in particular the three interacting Gaussian modes geometrical
overlap. The ratio between the theory and the experiment is roughly constant, of
the order of 0.4, which can be considered as satisfactory, in view of the experimental
calibration uncertainties, and of the various simplifying assumptions leading to the
previous formula (mainly the fact that there is no phase shift accumulated between
the two nonlinear interactions occurring in one round trip in the linear cavity which is
well known to increase threshold [12]). The increase in the threshold value when one
is far from the degeneracy point arises from the higher transmission and loss factor at
these wavelengths, due to the fact that the mirror reﬂection curves have been designed
to optimize the OPO close to degeneracy.

This minimum threshold of 5 mW was observed in a ﬁrst series of experiments
during which a spectrometer in the 2 µm range was available. We have thus obtained the
gross dependence of the threshold with temperature. In a second series of experiments,
we have improved the set-up by adding a ﬁltering cavity for the pump in order to improve
mode-matching and thus the oscillation threshold. Figure 5 shows the variation of the
output power as a function of pump power close to degeneracy in this improved version
of the setup. A rather satisfactory agreement between the experimental data and the
theoretical formula (in which the experimental value of the threshold has been used) is
obtained :

The maximum output power for a 300 mW pump and in the conditions of minimum
threshold is of 8 mW . The low conversion eﬃciency to the signal and idler modes is
of course due to the fact that the transmission of the output mirror is smaller than the
losses (mainly on the anti-reﬂection coatings) for these modes. This conﬁguration has
been chosen to minimize the threshold, and not to optimize the conversion eﬃciency.

4. Conclusion

We have demonstrated stable operation of a triply resonant OPO with an ultra-low
threshold below 1 mW close to degeneracy using periodically-poled Lithium Niobate
pumped by a Nd:YAG laser. Farther from degeneracy, the signal-idler frequencies
follow the expected parabola-shaped curve. The ultra low threshold obtained allows
operation well above threshold even for moderate pump powers far from the saturation
of photodiodes. This has enabled us to demonstrate quantum noise reduction on the
pump laser using periodically-poled materials [8].

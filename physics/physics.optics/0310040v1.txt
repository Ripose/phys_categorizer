Abstract

All-optical, mirrorless switching and bistability is demonstrated with bacteri-
orhodopsin (bR). A low-power, 532 nm laser beam modulates the transmission
of a cw laser beam at 635 nm that corresponds to peak absorption of the O-
excited state in the bR photocycle. The switch has features like a NOT-gate;
its switching contrast depends on the pulse width and average power of the
modulating laser. The phase of the switching characteristics can be controlled
by varying the pulse width and frequency of the modulating laser. Simula-
tions based on a rate equation approach considering a six-state model of the
bR photocycle successfully reproduce the experimental results.

A switch is the basic building block of information processing systems. Recent years have
witnessed tremendous research interest to develop all-optical switching and routing for high
speed, high-bandwidth communication and computing [1]. The key element in an all-optical
switch is a material that exhibits large nonlinear optical response. An ideal switching mate-
rial would also be expected to be small in size and weight, and possess high intrinsic speed,
low propagation delay and power dissipation, and oﬀer the possibility of tailoring proper-
ties for device applications [2]. Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is perhaps the simplest of nature’s
photon-driven molecular machines that oﬀers tantalizing possibilities of optical processing
at a molecular level [3]; it exhibits high quantum eﬃciency, large absorption cross-section
and nonlinearities as well as stability against environmental perturbations. A natural pho-
tochromic protein, bR is found in the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium and
has emerged as a prime candidate for bio-molecular photonic applications. By absorbing
green-yellow light, wild-type bR protein undergoes several structural transformations in a
well-characterized photocycle, B570 →K610 →L540 →M410 →N550 →O640 →B570, where let-
ters denote the diﬀerent electronic states, and subscripts correspond to their respective peak
absorption wavelengths (in nm). All-optical switching in bR has been reported earlier using
complex, multiple-laser geometries involving holograms [4], refractive index modulation [5]
and enhanced photo-induced anisotropy [6]. In this Letter, we demonstrate an extremely
simple, mirrorless all-optical switch with bR using a low-power cw “signal” beam at 635 nm
that is switched by a pulsed “modulating” beam at 532 nm. Our switch exhibits bistability
and exhibits features like a NOT-gate. The pulse width and intensity of the modulating
beam aﬀects the switching characteristics and this is further probed by theoretical simula-
tions using a rate equation approach.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the simple experimental set up. The ﬁlm of wild-type bR
used in our experiments had a pH of 7, and optical density 3 at 570 nm. The 532 nm
modulating beam was obtained from a frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4 laser. A mechanical
chopper was used to change the modulation frequency. The signal beam from a 10.8 mW cw
635 nm diode laser, was switched by absorption in the bR ﬁlm. The wavelength of 635 nm is
in close proximity to the peak absorption wavelength (640 nm) of the intermediate O-state
in the bR photocycle. The diameters of the modulating and signal beams were 4 mm and
2 mm, respectively. These beams were monitored by photodiodes connected to a digital
oscilloscope. The performance of the switch was studied over a range of pulse widths (3-16
ms) and power (5-58 mW) of the modulating beam. By way of illustration, experimental
manifestation of all-optical switching is shown in Fig. 2(a) for a modulating pulse width of
3.3 ms and average incident power of 39 mW; the modulating pulse proﬁle and the temporal
variation of transmitted signal intensity (TSI) is shown for wild-type bR. The TSI is initially
high (switch“on” state) due to relatively low linear absorption. When the modulating laser
beam irradiates the sample, it activates the bR photocycle and, hence, excites bR molecules
such that the O-state becomes populated. This leads to increased absorption of the signal
beam and consequent decrease in its transmission (switch “oﬀ” state).
In our series of
experiments we have observed that as the modulating pulse width increases, the percentage
modulation of the transmitted signal beam also increases.

Theoretical simulations have been carried out by considering bR molecules exposed to
two light beams of intensities Im (modulating) and Is (signal), that modulate the population
densities (N) of diﬀerent states through excitation and de-excitation processes. They are

2

described by rate equations of the form dN/dt = ˆON, where the ˆO operator is deﬁned in
terms of photo-induced and thermal transitions of all the six states (B, K, L, M, N and
O) in the bR photocycle using methodology that has been described in detail elsewhere
[7]. Excitation of the bR sample has been considered due to both the 532 nm and 635
nm laser beams, as the signal beam is not very weak in comparison to the modulating
beam. The propagation of the signal beam is governed by Is = Is0exp[−αs(Im, Is)L], where
αs(Im, Is) is the intensity-dependent absorption coeﬃcient of the signal beam written here as
αs(Im, Is) = NB(Im, Is)σBs+NK(Im, Is)σKs+NL(Im, Is)σLs+NN (Im, Is)σN s+NO(Im, Is)σOs,
where σ is the absorption cross-section of the state denoted by the subscript and s denotes its
value at the wavelength of the signal beam. The experimental curves have been modeled by
a super-Gaussian modulating laser pulse of the form Im = Im0exp[−22mln2((t − t0)/∆t)2m],
where m is the pulse proﬁle parameter and ∆t is the pulse width. The quantum eﬃciency
for transitions B↔K and the ﬁlm thickness (L), have been considered to be 0.64 and 60
mm respectively. The theoretical simulations have been carried out using typical values of
absorption cross-sections and rate constants of intermediate states [3,8].

The simulated optical switching curves (Fig. 2b) were obtained for the same conditions
as the experimental measurement (Fig. 2a), namely, ∆t = 3.3 ms, n = 208.3 Hz, m = 2
at ﬁxed average power of 39 mW. Both the switch on/oﬀ time and percentage modulation
was observed to increase with pulse width (Dt), with the modulation level saturating after
a certain value. For instance, for ∆t = 3.3 ms, the measured “oﬀ” and “on” times are 3.0
ms and 1.8 ms respectively, in reasonable accord with corresponding simulated values of 2.8
ms and 2.0 ms. The symmetry of the switching curves expectedly increases for Dt greater
than the relaxation time of the complete bR photocycle, as this conforms to the steady state
case. Switching characteristics measured with somewhat higher average modulating power
(58 mW) are shown in Fig. 3a, for ∆t = 16 ms. The corresponding simulated curves are
shown in Fig. 3b with m = 5. As before, an increase in the average modulating power results
in an increase in the percentage modulation, which saturates at higher values. From Figs. 2
and 3, it is evident that simulated results are in good accord with experimental results even
though the asymmetric proﬁle of the input modulating pulse has been approximated by a
symmetric super-Gaussian function.

The optical bistability that is a feature of our switch is depicted in Fig. 3 where the
functional relationship between the modulating and output signals is, characteristically, in
the form of a loop in each of the two cases shown (for diﬀerent values of ∆t). Bistabilities
in optical switches have been studied for more than 25 years, almost always in the context
of complex schemes that employ linear or non-linear interferometric geometries [9]. In such
geometries, changes in the light intensity within the ring cavity lead to variations in the
refractive index of the non-linear medium. This means that the phase change experience by
the light when travelling through such medium is altered; this continues until a stable point
is reached and results in bistable behaviour. In the case of bR, however, the bistability that
we observe is attributed to the intensity-dependent absorption coeﬃcient, αs(Im, Is). The
non-square nature of the loops that are shown in Fig. 3 is a consequence of the six diﬀerent
values of α that are involved in the bR photocycle, each of them being intensity dependent.
This leads to a “washing out” of the system response. Non-square loops have been observed
in earlier studies [10] employing single-wavelength excitation. Unlike previous work, the
orientation of the loop that we observe indicates that our switch exhibits features that are

3

akin to a NOT-gate; this is consistent with the phase lag between input and output signals
that are observed in our data, including the subset that is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. We found
little evidence of ringing or over-shooting, features that frequently manifest themselves in
bistable operation of cavity-based schemes [9].

Our simulations have enabled some further, important, insights to be obtained. We ﬁnd
that decrease in values of rate coeﬃcients kM , kN , and kO increases the switch “oﬀ” and
“on” time that, in turn, results in a shift of the switching curves towards longer time with
respect to the minima of the modulating pulses. The switching characteristics are more
sensitive to variation in kN and kO than to kM . Moreover, decrease in values of kN and
kO lowers percentage modulation contrary to earlier indications [7] from studies carried out
for a single modulating pulse, in which the percentage modulation was found to increase.
The present work diﬀers signiﬁcantly in that we now probe the eﬀect of kM and kO on the
switching characteristics for a train of pulses. We ﬁnd that as the ﬁrst modulating pulse
arrives, the population of the O-state increases, giving rise to increased absorption of the
signal beam and consequent switching “oﬀ” of the TSI. The arrival of the next modulating
pulse in the train stops the signal beam from rising to its initial value, and decreases the
TSI. After a few successive modulating pulses, the switching contrast remains constant and
appears as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Increase in kO results in an increase in the symmetry
of the switching characteristics as the total relaxation time of the photocycle becomes less
than the modulating pulse width and conforms to the steady state case. Variation in kO
also results in a shift in the average power of the transmitted signal beam, which increases
with kO.

We ﬁnd that the switching characteristics are also sensitive to the proﬁle of the modu-
lating pulse. Decreasing m makes the input pulse proﬁle nearly Gaussian, and the switching
characteristics become more symmetric due to gradual variation in intensity with time, which
is of the order of the lifecycle. Increasing m initially makes the pulse rise sharply and results
in an increase in the switch “oﬀ” time and decrease in the switch “on” time that, after a
certain value of m, saturates. The peaks in the signal transmission also shift to longer time
with respect to the minima of the modulating pulses, as the pulse on-oﬀ time is unequal. The
percentage modulation of the TSI also increases and saturates at higher m-values and the
peak-to-peak variation in intensity of the normalized input pulses becomes nearly unity. For
the same ﬁlm, decreasing the modulating pulse width and increasing its frequency results in
decrease in the percentage modulation and a shift in the switching characteristics such that
the modulation of the output signal beam appears to be in phase with the input modulating
pulses. For instance, for a peak modulating intensity of 468.6 mW cm−2, modulating pulse
width of ∆t = 0.15 ms, and a pulse train frequency of 3.3 kHz, the TSI becomes in phase
with the modulating pulse train. This is an important result as one can control the phase
of the switching characteristics by varying the modulating pulse width and its frequency.

The percentage modulation can be increased by selecting the modulating beam at 570
nm, which corresponds to the peak absorption of the initial B state. Moreover, the per-
centage modulation is very sensitive to the absorption of the signal beam by the initial
B state. Hence, narrowing the B-state absorption spectrum such that it does not absorb
the signal beam (σBs = 0), can lead to higher switching contrast (the signal beam can be
nearly completely switched “oﬀ” by the modulating beam). For instance, in the present
case, for ∆t = 16 ms at Pav = 58 mW, for the same parameters, the percentage modulation

4

would increase from 14% to 85% as σBs → 0. Decreasing the photocycle time with σBs =
0, further increases the percentage modulation. Hence, complete switching at low powers
and low switching time can be achieved when the signal beam is not absorbed by the initial
B-state (σBs = 0), and when the total photocycle time is small. Adjusting the modulating
beam intensity also controls the switching contrast. Since the molecular properties of bR,
such as the relaxation rates, absorption cross-sections and spectra of the intermediate states
are amenable to modiﬁcation by physical, chemical and genetic engineering techniques, the
switching characteristics of bR can be tailored for speciﬁc applications [3]. Since bR can
also be processed as a large aperture ﬁlm, or in a crystalline form for 2D/3D applications,
bR-based all-optical switches would be potentially useful in applications that involve provi-
sioning of light paths in optical cross-connects and add-drop systems in wavelength division
multiplexing optical networks. Controlling the phase of the switching characteristics by the
modulating pulse width and frequency may also prove to be of utility in future designs of
all-optical light modulators and phase shifters.

In summary, we have shown absorptive, all-optical switching and bistability with bR,
with advantages of small size, extremely simple low-power operation, small linear absorption
coeﬃcient, mirror-less structure and ﬂexibility of design. A simulation analysis has also been
made and theoretical switching characteristics have been shown to be in good agreement
with experimental results.

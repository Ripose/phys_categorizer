We provide a rigorous theoretical basis for the artiﬁcial magnetic activity of meta-materials near
resonances. Our approach is a renormalization-based scheme that authorises a completely general
theory. The major result is an explicit expression of the eﬀective permeability, in terms of resonant
frequencies. The theoretical results are checked numerically and we give applications of our theory
to Left-Handed Media and to the solution of the Pokrovski-Efros paradox.

Photonic crystals are artiﬁcial devices, periodically
structured, that exhibit photonic band gaps [1]. Di-
electric photonic crystals are considered in the optical
domain, but metallic ones (or wire mesh photonic crys-
tals) are also studied in the microwave or TeraHz range
[2, 3].
It has been well established [4] that, below a
cut frequency, wire mesh photonic crystals behave as
if they were homogeneous with a negative, frequency-
2πγ/ (ω/c)2,
dependent, permittivity given by εeﬀ = 1
where γ = d2 log(d/r) (here d is the period of the crystal
and r the radius of the wires) [5]. For a fequency below
ωp = √2πγ c, the homogenized permittivity is negative
and the propagation of waves is forbidden. The homog-
enized permittivity represents the scattering behavior of
the wire mesh photonic crystal for large enough wave-
lengths, and explains why these structures present a pho-
tonic band gap down to the null frequency (at least for
inﬁnitely conducting wires). Recently, Pendry and co-
authors suggested that it was possible to design photonic
crystals with non-magnetic materials that they possess
an artiﬁcial magnetic activity [6] and be described by
an eﬀective permeability. Basically, two geometries have
been suggested: Split Ring Resonators and dielectric
ﬁbers with a large permittivity [6, 7]. It is believed that
with these geometries it is possible to obtain a negative
permeability, and, by adding a wire mesh structure, to
design a material with both a negative permittivity and a
negative permeability. Materials with these characteris-
tics do not seem to exist in nature, and therefore one tries
to design them artiﬁcially (they are called ”Left-Handed
Materials”). They were studied theoretically long ago in
a speculative and quite fascinating work [8] by Veselago.
He showed that they behave as if they had a negative
index. Among other properties, Snell-Descartes law is
reversed: at the interface between air and the material a
beam is refracted on the same side of the normal. These
ideas have motivated a lot of works, both experimentally
and numerically (in particular in [9]), and also a lot of

polemical issues [10].

It seems however that, hitherto, there be no uniﬁed
theoretical approach to this kind of eﬀective behavior.
The method generally followed consists in characteriz-
ing the scattering matrix of a basic resonator by means
of the ε and µ parameters, and then deriving the eﬀec-
tive parameters without taking into account the coupling
between each resonator [11].
In the present work, we
address this problem by using a renormalization group
analysis, which gives us a deep insight into the phenom-
ena and predicts that the existence of a negative µ is
linked to internal resonances. In fact, the possibility of
getting a negative permeability is very diﬀerent from the
possibility of getting a negative permittivity: while the
negative ε is obtained for low-frequencies (i.e. large wave-
length with respect to the wires constituting the crystal),
the negative µ is obtained in the resonant domain, and
only for a rather small interval of frequencies. In partic-
ular, our approach explains the apparent paradox raised
by Pokrovsky al.
[12], that, by embedding wires in a
medium with negative µ, one does not get a Left Handed
Medium. It gives also a complete analysis of the eﬀective
properties of wire mesh photonic crystal, with a very high
conductivity. Before going into the details of our study,
we stress that we have tried here to make a bridge be-
tween two domains that seem to be antagonist: that of
the resonances and that of homogenization.

In the following, we consider a 2D photonic crystal
whose Wigner-Seitz cell Y is given in ﬁg. 1. It is made of
a dielectric rod (relative permittivity εi, cross-section D)
embedded in a dielectric matrix εe. When the contrast
between εi and εe is substantial enough, there appear Mie
resonances into the highest index material. It was sug-
gested some time ago [13] that such internal resonances
might result in the opening of forbidden gaps. Our point
is to show that, near these resonances, the device behaves
as if it had homogeneous electromagnetic parameters εh
and µh. Of course, for this situation to be physically

We have obtained a microscopic Maxwell system that
describes the microscopic behavior of the ﬁelds. It can
be seen that E1 gives indeed a ﬁrst order expansion of the
ﬁeld inside D: it replaces E0 which is null there. Let us
now use the fact that the ﬁelds are polarized. We write:
B0(x) = u0(x)ez. Plugging this expression into system
(4) shows that the magnetic ﬁeld is independent of y on

sounded, the resonant wavelengths should be larger than
the period, otherwise the medium could not be described
by homogeneous parameters. That is why we request,
as in [6], that εi be much higher then εe. The method
that we employ consists in changing (”renormalizing”)
the properties of the medium while keeping the relevant
physical phenomena, i.e. the resonances, unchanged. To
do so, we choose a small number τ < 1, and we proceed
to the following operation, denoted

variable x (the global variable) and on the Wigner-Seitz

odic with respect to y. Our point is to ﬁnd the limit
ﬁelds E0, B0. The local variable is in fact a hidden one:
it is an internal degree of freedom. The true (observ-
able) macroscopic ﬁelds (Eh, Bh) are the averages of the

The macroscopic behavior of the system is characterized
by an eﬀective permittivity tensor εh and an eﬀective
permeability µh . This shows that the system exhibits
an artiﬁcial magnetic activity. There are two huge diﬀer-
ences between the eﬀective permittivity and the eﬀective
permeability: the permittivity can be a matrix, hence the
medium can be anisotropic, whereas the eﬀective perme-
ability is always a scalar, therefore no anisotropic perme-
ability can be obtained. Second, the permittivity is not
frequency dependent, it is a static permittivity, whereas
the permeability depends on the frequency. Let us give
a closer look at the system of equations that deﬁnes the
eﬀective permeability µh. As it stands in (6) it is just
a partial diﬀerential equation problem. Under this form,
its physical meaning does not appear clearly. To make it
more explicit, let us recast it into an eigenvalue problem.
This will help us understanding the underlying physics
of what might look, at this stage, as a rather abstract re-
sult. The system (6) has a unique solution only if there is
no function ψ such that ψ is null on Y
D and ψ satisﬁes
the same Helmholtz equation on D. Otherwise m + ψ
would still be a solution of (6). Following spectral theory

understood by going back to the unrenormalized initial

strongly localized inside the ﬁber. However, when there
is a large number of ﬁbers these resonances are slightly
shifted due to coupling, and these resonances are further-
more modiﬁed by the renormalization process. That is
precisely what the eigenvalues of problem (12) are: the
renormalized Mie frequencies of the ﬁbre.

plete generality, that the permeability exhibits anoma-

due to the fact that we have only kept the ﬁrst order
terms in the expansions (1).

Let us give an explicit computation in case of a square
ﬁber. The derivation is rather straightforward, and
follows closely that of the well-known T E modes in
waveguides with square section. The eigenfunctions are

merical applications. First, we note that our analysis is
supposed to work when there are Mie resonances at wave-
lengths large with respect to the period of the crystal.
This was the situation described in [7], where ε = 200+5i.
We choose this value for our own numerical computa-
tions, the point being to test the validity of the theory.
Using a rigorous diﬀraction code for gratings [18], we
plot the transmission spectrum (dashed line in ﬁg. 2)
for a stack of 3 diﬀraction gratings made of square rods.
There is a band gap for λ/d between 8 and 12, due to a
Mie resonance. In order to test our results, we plot the
transmission spectrum of a homogeneous slab (solid line
ﬁg. 2) with parameters εh = 1.7 (this value is obtained
numerically from the resolution of problem (10)) and µh
given in (14). We see in ﬁg. 2 that both curves ﬁt very
well, indicating that, although the wavelength is not that
large, the whole photonic crystal behaves as a homoge-
neous magnetic material. The discrepancy that is seen
around λ/d = 6.5 is due to the presence of a Mie reso-
nance of null mean value that is not taken into account

in our theory. Only by expanding the ﬁelds to the second
order could we incorporate this resonance in our global
result.

Finally, let us use these results to analyze recent prob-
lem. In [12], Pokrosky and al. showed that it was not
possible to design a negative index medium by embedding
metallic wires into a matrix with a negative µ, whereas
the converse is possible. This can be explained in the
following manner: the negative permittivity is obtained
as a macroscopic eﬀect, by which we mean that it is an

4

interference eﬀect and not an eﬀect that takes place at
the scale of the microscopic cell only. In much a diﬀerent
way, the negative permeability is obtained as a purely
local eﬀect, that happens at the scale of the microscopic
cell. Therefore, for this eﬀect to occur, no strong coupling
between the ﬁbers is requested, the coupling has just to
be suﬃcient enough that the incident ﬁeld can reach the
ﬁbers by tunnel eﬀect.
In our model, the propagation
equation of the structure is obtained immediately by re-
placing εe by
εe. Then, near the regions of anomalous
dispersion, both parameters are negative and the prop-
agation equation is the usual Helmholtz equation. Con-
sequently, the ﬁeld can propagate. On the contrary, for
metallic wires in a medium with negative µ the propaga-
tion equation reads [17, 19]: ∆u+k2µ(1
2πγ/µk2)u = 0,
which leads to evanescent waves.

We have given in this work a theory of the mesocopic
magnetism in metamaterials. We have shown that it was
possible to give a homogenized description of a hetero-
geneous device in the resonance domain. To do so, we
have used a renormalization approach that shows that
two scales should be distinguished: a microscopic one
and a macroscopic one. We have shown that the artiﬁ-
cial, mesoscopic, magnetism is due to microscopic mag-
netic moments induced by geometric resonances. So far,
the analysis works for high permittivities, but we stress
that there are inner resonances in gratings for much lower
contrasts as well [20]. Therefore, we do believe that the
same physics can be found in the optical range of wave-
lengths.

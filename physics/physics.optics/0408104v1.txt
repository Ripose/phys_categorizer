This paper presents a novel approach to wave propagation inside the Fabry-Perot framework. It
states that the time-averaged Poynting vector modulus could be nonequivalent with the squared-
ﬁeld amplitude modulus. This fact permits the introduction of a new kind of nonlinear medium
whose nonlinearity is proportional to the time-averaged Poynting vector modulus. Its transmittance
is calculated and found to diﬀer with that obtained for the Kerr medium, whose nonlinearity is
proportional to the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus. The latter emphasizes the nonequivalence of
these magnitudes.

A classical topic in electromagnetism is the study of
wave transmission in a ﬁnite parallel-plane faces medium,
know as Fabry-Perot resonator. When the medium
presents nonlinear behavior, bistability appears [1]. To
explain this phenomenon, the nonlinear Fabry-Perot res-
onator (NLFP) was modelled by a third order suscep-
tibility or Kerr-type nonlinearity [2]. At monochro-
matic plane wave excitation, the NLFP stationary regime
is summarized in a non-time-dependent nonlinear wave
equation for the complex ﬁeld amplitudes, the nonlinear
Helmholtz equation (NLHE). Hence, the reﬂectance and
transmittance problem reduces to ﬁnding the NLHE so-
lution with appropriate boundary conditions for the ﬁeld
amplitude modulus and phase.

The NLHE complexity led to approximate methods
of resolution. Many approaches consider two counter-
propagating waves in the medium and the analysis is
done by separately considering the eﬀects on each wave
[2, 3, 4, 5]. Unfortunately, the linear superposition prin-
ciple is no longer valid in nonlinear media and the separa-
tion of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in these back and forth
waves is meaningless. As a result, the NLHE separa-
tion into two equations, one for each wave, is only possi-
ble by neglecting various coupling nonlinear terms that
would give an important contribution to the accuracy of
the transmittance results. Also the Slowly Varying En-
velope Approximation (SVEA) is often applied to these
waves [2, 3, 4] when, yet within the counter-propagating
wave approach, its validity was questioned [5]. Also, the
boundary conditions were simpliﬁed rather than rigor-
ously treating them [2, 6]. The above facts suggest that
all these approximated approaches could not physically
be equivalents to the exact problem.

The works done by Chen and Mills exactly solve the
NLFP for an absorptiveness Kerr-type medium [7]. The
proper of its resolution method was to assume a gen-
eral complex ﬁeld within the medium, disregarding the
concept of counter-propagating waves. Chen and Mills

derive a two coupled equation system for the ﬁeld ampli-
tude modulus and phase together with general boundary
conditions, thus obtaining an analytic-transcendental so-
lution for the transmittance of the NLFP.

On the other hand, their work permitted us to note
a implicit diﬀerence between the time-averaged Poynting
vector modulus, i.e. the electromagnetic radiation inten-
sity I, and the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus (|E|2)
inside the nonlinear medium.
If the nonequivalence of
these magnitudes were true, it could change certain well-
established fundamental concepts in classical electrody-
namics. This fact motivated us to develop a novel ap-
proach to wave propagation in nonlinear media inside
the Fabry-Perot framework called S-Formalism.
It in-
troduces a new variable related to the time-averaged
Poynting vector which states that its magnitude could
be nonequivalent with the squared-ﬁeld amplitude mod-
ulus contrary to commonly accepted. Furthermore, the
S-Formalism presents two important advantages: it per-
mits to directly monitor the radiation intensity within
the medium, and it avoids approximations, such as the
SVEA, simpliﬁcation of boundary conditions, and so on.
The fact that the time-averaged Poynting vector mod-
ulus be nonequivalent with the squared-ﬁeld amplitude
modulus, as the S-Formalism will show, implies that the
nonlinearity of Kerr-type media is not proportional to the
intensity which is contrary to what has been established
to-date. This assertion leads to the following question
regarding the modelling of the NLFP: is it a Kerr-type
nonlinearity, or does it vary proportionately to the inten-
sity? As this question does not have a deﬁnitive answer,
the existence of the latter cannot be denied. We deﬁne
the Poynting medium as the medium where nonlinear-
ity is proportional to intensity. Then, our objective is to
solve the Poynting-NLFP through the S-Formalism com-
paring the resultant transmittance with that obtained
for a Kerr-NLFP to remark the nonequivalence between
squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus and radiation intensity.

FIG. 1: An harmonic plane wave strikes a nonlinear Fabry-
Perot resonator, to be reﬂected and transmitted. The Regions
I and III constitute, for simplicity, the same linear dielectric
medium (e.g., air).

Below, we derive the S-Formalism in the following
form: ﬁrst the time-averaged Poynting vector assum-
ing harmonic ﬁelds is calculated. Then, a dimension-
less variable which is proportional to intensity is intro-
duced. Thus, a set of ﬁeld evolution diﬀerential equa-
tions and the general boundary condition equations on
the new ﬁeld variable are obtained, which constitutes the
S-Formalism . Finally, it is applied to derive the trans-
mittance for the Poynting-NLFP and the results com-
pared with that obtained for a Kerr-NLFP.

Refering to Figure 1, we start writing the linearly po-
larized transversal harmonic electromagnetic ﬁelds of fre-
quency ω as

perpendicularly on a nonmagnetic, isotropic, and spa-
tially nondispersive medium of thickness d (region II).
The optical ﬁeld is assumed to maintain its polarization
along this region so that a scalar approach is valid. The
reﬂected and transmitted plane waves have amplitudes
rE0 and tE0 with r and t the complex reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients, respectively. Then, at region

directly related with the intensity inside the medium and
which will characterize the S-Formalism. From Eq. (7) it
is clear that if φ is not a linear function on z, as is often
happens in nonlinear media, then S and ǫ2 are nonequiv-
alents.

The next step is to derive the NLHE in terms of the
classical ﬁeld variables (ǫ, φ), and transform it into a set
of equivalent equations in terms of (ǫ, S). The NLHE is
derived from the macroscopic Maxwell equations comple-
mented by appropriate constitutive relations. We assume
that the polarization P, and current density J, vary only
in the electric ﬁeld direction with frequency ω, neglecting
higher harmonics, and their spatial-dependent complex
amplitudes satisfy the following constitutive relations:

where χgen and σgen are the generalized susceptibility

the linear as well as a possible nonlinear medium re-
sponse. Note that the constitutive relations are not ex-
plicitly written since cases could exist where it is not pos-
sible to describe the nonlinear polarization and current
density by the classical electric ﬁeld power expansion.
It will seen that the Poynting medium is an example.
Thereby, the scalar NLHE is

This equation constitutes the starting point to study sev-
eral linear and nonlinear monochromatic wave propaga-
tion phenomena within the Fabry-Perot framework. Sub-
stituting Eq. (4) into (10) and by using Eq. (7), we de-
rive the following set of spatial evolution equations for

To guarantee the physical content of the solution, these
equations must be necessarily complemented with the fol-
lowing boundary conditions: the continuity of the tan-
gential components of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld at
the interfaces. The general boundary conditions were
rigourously derived in Ref.
[7]: four equations as func-
tions of (ǫ, φ) at z = 0 and z = d which, by using Eq.

situations where the relationship I = cte|E2| holds true:
ﬁrstly, a single plane wave propagates in a inﬁnite or
semi-inﬁnite linear dielectric characterized by σgen = 0
and χgen = χ(1) where χ(1) is the linear susceptibility.
Under these conditions, Eqs. (11) relate the constants S
and ǫ by S = (1 + χ(1))1/2 ǫ2; secondly, a single plane
wave propagates in a semi-inﬁnite linear absorber char-
acterized by χgen = χ(1) and σgen = σ where σ is the
ohmic conductivity and such that S(z) ∝ ǫ2(z), being
both proportional to a decreasing exponential function
of z. On the contrary, when the medium is ﬁnite, e.g. a
Fabry-Perot with boundary conditions at interfaces, S is
no longer equivalent to ǫ2, not even for the linear dielec-
tric case because S is a constant and ǫ2 is an oscillating
function of z [8].

At this point, we introduce the Poynting medium by

the following constitutive relations:

χgen = χ(1) + γI0S(z),

σgen = 0,

where γ is the nonlinear coeﬃcient. Eqs. (11) have a
simple analytical solution given by

From Eqs. (6) and (12), the transmittance is obtained

expression:

where γ > 0 and k2

|r|2 + |t|2 = 1 − (S(0) − S(d)) .

(14)

This equation establishes that the reﬂectance and trans-
mittance are limited by the boundary values of the time-
averaged Poynting vector. For a nonabsorbent medium
S(d) = S(0), then |r|2 + |t|2 = 1.

Equations (11) and (12) represent the ”S-Formalism”
which were derived without assuming approximations
such as the counter-propagating waves, SVEA, simpli-
ﬁcations on the boundary conditions, and so on. Also,
note that Eq. (11b) represents the time-averaged Poynt-
ing Theorem applied to the problem of harmonic ﬁelds,
simplifying the interpretation of σgen as the dissipation
properties of the medium. In particular, when σgen = 0,
the dimensionless intensity S is a constant ﬁxed by
the boundary conditions. Furthermore, through S(z) it
is possible to monitor directly the intensity along the
medium as a function of the spatial coordinate, as op-
posed to using the conventional formalism.

The S-Formalism is useful to analyze the linear case as
well as the nonlinear one. Before to study the latter, i.e.
the comparison between the Poynting and Kerr media in
an eﬀort to show the explicit diﬀerence between S (or I)
and ǫ2 (or |E2|) in nonlinear media, we refer to the linear
case. According to our analysis [8], there are only two

where F = k0(1 − k1/k0)2/(4k1). Carefully noting that
Eq. (20) is a transcendental expression since k1 depends
on S0.

Now, we compare the transmittance results of the

Poynting and Kerr media. The latter deﬁned by

χgen = χ(1) + γI0ǫ2(z),

σgen = 0.

The Kerr-NLFP transmittance results were taken from
Ref.
[7]. Figure 2 shows T against the nonlinear pa-
rameter γI0 to two diﬀerent values of χ(1). Figures 2(ai)
and 2(bi) correspond to the Poynting and Kerr medium,
respectively. From these ﬁgures, it is apparent that the
transmittance of the Poynting-NLFP as well as the Kerr-
NLFP are multistable. However, for increasing values

Kerr medium. We ﬁnd marked disagreement in the trans-
mittance of both media, which support the diﬀerences
between I and |E|2. Besides, the S-Formalism presents
two important advantages: it permits to directly monitor
the time-averaged Poynting vector in the medium and it
avoids approximations, such as SVEA, simpliﬁcation of
the boundary conditions, and so on. The statements and
analysis pointed out here constitute an advance on the-
oretical views of basic concepts in electrodynamics. The
S-Formalism could be important in problems where the
time-averaged Poynting vector must be rigourously moni-
tored like in photoconductor or photorefractive materials.
Finally, we leave open the possibility that experimental
techniques, based on intensity dependent phase changes
of a Gaussian beam such as Z-Scan Technique [9], could
not truly measure Kerr-type nonlinearity. On the con-
trary, they could be measuring a Poynting-type instead.

of χ(1), the peak transmittance separation is maintained
for the Kerr medium while it increases for the Poynting
medium. Also, the Kerr multistability appears for small-
est values of the nonlinear parameter γI0. The transmit-
tance diﬀerence of both media emphasizes the I and |E|2
nonequivalence. Figure 3 depicts T on the dimensionless
thickness k0d(1 + χ(1))1/2/(2π) enhancing the nonlinear-
ity diﬀerence of Poynting and Kerr media. Note that the
departure from Airy-type function for the Kerr medium
is stronger than for the Poynting medium. Furthermore,
while the Poynting nonlinear susceptibility, χgen − χ(1),
has a constant value along the medium, Kerr’s varies
periodically as Fig. 4 shows. This fact implies the for-
mation of a phase grating in the Kerr medium on the
contrary to the Poynting medium.

In summary, we derive a new formalism in terms of
dimensionless variables related with the time-averaged
Poynting vector and ﬁeld amplitude modulus within the
Fabry-Perot framework. The S-Formalism shows explic-
itly that the energy intensity and squared-ﬁeld ampli-
tude modulus are only equivalents for a single plane wave
propagating in a linear inﬁnite or semi-inﬁnite medium.
Otherwise, they are nonequivalents. To account for this
diﬀerence we introduce the Poynting medium, whose
nonlinearity is proportional to the intensity instead of the

I. INTRODUCTION

As described in Part I [1], atom-mediated photon-
photon scattering is the microscopic process underlying
the optical Kerr nonlinearity in atomic media. The Kerr
nonlinearity produces such eﬀects as self-phase modula-
tion, self-focusing and self-defocusing and four-wave mix-
ing. In an atomic medium, resonanant nonlinearities can
give rise to very large nonlinear optical eﬀects, suggesting
the possibility of nonlinear optical interactions with only
a few photons [2]. Unfortunately, the same resonances
which could facilitate such experiments make them dif-
ﬁcult to analyze [3]. In Part I we showed theoretically
that the photon-photon interaction is not intrinsically
lossy, and can be fast on the time scale of atomic relax-
ation. Here we describe an experiment to directly mea-
sure the time-duration of the photon-photon interaction
in a transparent medium.

In the scattering experiment, two oﬀ-resonance laser
beams collide in a rubidium vapor cell and scattering
products are detected at right angles. The process of
phase-matched resonance ﬂuorescence in this geometry
has been described as spontaneous four-wave mixing [4],
a description which applies to our oﬀ-resonant excitation
as well. This geometry has been of interest in quantum
optics for generating phase-conjugate reﬂection [5]. Ele-
gant experiments with a barium atomic beam [6] showed
antibunching in multi-atom resonance ﬂuorescence, but a
separation of timescales was not possible since the detun-
ing, linewidth and doppler width were all of comparable
magnitude.

II. SETUP

A free-running 30mW diode laser at 780nm was tem-
perature stabilized and actively locked to the point of
minimum ﬂuorescence between the hyperﬁne-split res-
onances of the D2 line of rubidium. Saturation spec-
troscopy features could be observed using this laser, indi-
cating a linewidth δν < 200 MHz. This linewidth is small
compared with the detuning from the nearest absorp-
tion line δν = 1.3 GHz . Direct observation of the laser
output with a fast photodiode (3 dB rolloﬀ at 9 GHz)
showed no signiﬁcant modulation in the frequency band
100 MHz – 2 GHz. The laser beam was was shaped by

passage through a single-mode polarization-maintaining
ﬁber, collimated and passed through a scattering cell to a
retro-reﬂection mirror. The beam within the cell was lin-
early polarized in the vertical direction. The beam waist
(at the retroreﬂection mirror) was 0.026 cm ×0.023 cm
(intensity FWHM, vertical × horizontal). The center of
the cell was 1.9 cm from the retroreﬂection mirror, thus
within a Rayleigh range of the waist. With optimal align-
ment, the laser could deliver 1.95 mW to the cell, giving
a maximal Rabi frequency of ΩRabi ≈ 2 × 109s−1, signif-
icantly less than the minimal detuning of δ = 2π × 1.3
GHz = 8 × 109s−1. For this reason, we have neglected
saturation of the transitions in the analysis.

The retro-reﬂected beam returned through the ﬁber
and was picked oﬀ by a beamsplitter. The single-mode
ﬁber acted as a near-ideal spatial ﬁlter and the returned
power through the ﬁber provides a quantitative measure
of the mode ﬁdelity on passing through the rubidium cell.
With optimal alignment it was possible to achieve a mode
ﬁdelity (described below) of 36%.

The cell, an evacuated cuvette ﬁlled with natural abun-
dance rubidium vapor, was maintained at a temperature
of 330 K to produce a density of about 1.6 ×1010 cm−3.
Irises near the cell limited the ﬁeld of view of the detec-
tors. Stray light reaching the detectors was negligible, as
were the detectors’ dark count rates of < 100 cps.

With the aide of an auxiliary laser beam, two single-
photon counting modules (SPCMs) were positioned to
detect photons leaving the detection region in opposite
directions.
In particular, photons scattered at right-
angles to the incident beams and in the direction per-
pendicular to the drive beam polarization were observed.
Each detector had a 500 µm diameter active area and a
quantum eﬃciency of about 70%. The detectors were at
a distance of 70 cm from the center of the cell. The
eﬀective position of one detector could be scanned in
two dimensions by displacing the alignment mirrors with
inchworm motors. A time-to-amplitude converter and
multichannel analyzer were used to record the time-delay
spectrum. The system time response was measured us-
ing sub-picosecond pulses at 850nm as an impulse source.
The response was well described by a Lorentzian of width
810 ps (FWHM).

Optimal alignment of the laser beam to the input ﬁber
coupler could not always be maintained against thermal
drifts in the laboratory. This aﬀected the power of the

1

drive beams in the cell but not their alignment or beam
shape. These were preserved by the mode-ﬁltering of the
ﬁber. Since the shape of the correlation function depends
on beam shape and laser tuning but not on beam power,
this reduction in drive power reduced the data rate but
did not introduce errors into the correlation signal.

is altered by experimental limitations. First, beam dis-
tortion in passing through the cell windows reduces the
photon-photon scattering signal. Second, ﬁnite detector
response time and ﬁnite detector size act to disperse the
signal. None of these eﬀects alters the incoherent scat-
tering background.

Beam distortion is quantiﬁed by the ﬁdelity factor in-

troduced in Part I

A. Experimental Results

F ≡ 4

The time-delay spectrum of a data run of 45 hours
is shown in Fig. 2. The detectors were placed to col-
lect back-to-back scattering products to maximize the
photon-photon scattering signal. A Gaussian function
P (tA − tB) ﬁtted to the data has a contrast [P (0) −
P (∞)]/P (∞) of 0.046 ± 0.008, a FWHM of 1.3 ± 0.3 ns,
and a center of −0.07 ± 0.11 ns. This center position is
consistent with zero, as one would expect by the symme-
try of the scattering process. For comparison, a reference
spectrum is shown. This was taken under the same con-
ditions but with one detector intentonally misaligned by
much more than the angular width of the scattering sig-
nal.

The angular dependence of the scattering signal was in-
vestigated by acquiring time-delay spectra as a function
of detector position. To avoid drifts over the week-long
acquision, the detector was scanned in a raster pattern,
remaining on each point for 300 s before shifting to the
next. Points were spaced at 1 mm intervals. Total live
acquisition time was 9 hours per point. The aggregate
time-spectrum from each location was ﬁtted to a Gaus-
sian function with ﬁxed width and center determined
from the data of Fig. 2. The position-dependent con-
trast C(x,y) is shown in Fig. 3. A negative value for the
contrast means that the best ﬁt had a coincidence dip
rather than a coincidence peak at zero time. These neg-
ative values are not statistically signiﬁcant. Fitted to a
Gaussian function, C(x,y) has a peak of 0.044 ±.010 and
angular widths (FWHM) of 1.1 ± 0.7 mrad and 3.7 ± 0.4
mrad in the horizontal and vertical directions, respec-
tively.

These angular widths are consistent with the expected
coherence of scattering products [7]. Seen from the de-
tector positions, the excitation beam is narrow in the
vertical direction, with a Gaussian shape of beam waist
wy = 0.009 cm, but is limited in the horizontal direction
only by the apertures, of size ∆z = 0.08 cm. Thus we
expect angular widths of 0.9 mrad and 3.25 mrad, where
the ﬁrst describes diﬀraction of a Gaussian, the second
diﬀraction from a hard aperture.

III. COMPARISON TO THEORY

The correlation signal predicted by the theory of Part
I is shown in Fig. 4. The ideal contrast is 1.53 and the
FWHM is 870 ps. The shape of the time correlations

The greatest contrast occurs when H is the phase-
conjugate, or time-reverse of G, i.e., when H(x) = G∗(x).

Green’s theorem can be used to show that the volume
integral is proportional to the mode-overlap integral

Z d3xG(x)H(x) = ∆zZ dxdyG(x)H(x),

(3)

where the last integration is taken at any ﬁxed z and
∆z is the length of the interaction region. Similarly, the
beam powers are invariant under propagation and the
mode ﬁdelity can be expressed entirely in terms of sur-
face integrals as

The overlap of G and H also determines the eﬃciency of
coupling back into the ﬁber. This allows us to determine
F . In terms of Pin, the power leaving the output ﬁber
coupler and Pret, the power returned through the ﬁber
after being retro-reﬂected, this is

F =

where η = 0.883 is the intensity transmission coeﬃcient
of the ﬁber and coupling lenses and T = 0.92 is the trans-
mission coeﬃcient for a single-pass through a cell win-
dow. We ﬁnd F = 0.36 ± 0.03. The mode ﬁdelity acts
twice to reduce contrast, once as the drive beams enter
the cell, and again on the photons leaving the cell. This
beam distortion has no eﬀect on the incoherent scattering
background, thus the visibility is reduced by F 2.

The ﬁnite time response of the detector system acts to
disperse the coincidence signal over a larger time window.
This reduces the maximum contrast by a factor of 0.27

2

and increases the temporal width to 1.62 ns. Similarly,
the ﬁnite detector area reduces the maximum contrast by
a factor of 0.81 and spreads the angular correlations by a
small amount. The resulting coincidence signal is shown
in Fig. 6. Fitted to a Gaussian, the ﬁnal signal contrast
is 0.042 ±0.007, where the uncertainty reﬂects the uncer-
tainty in F . This is consistent with the observed contrast
of 0.044 ± 0.010.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have measured the temporal and angular correla-
tions in photon-photon scattering mediated by atomic
rubidium vapor. We found good agreement between ex-
periment and the perturbative theory presented in Part
I. The observed temporal correlations are of the order of
one nanosecond, much faster than the system can relax
by radiative processes. This is consistent with the predic-
tion that the duration of the photon-photon interaction

is determined by the inhomogeneous broadening of the
vapor.

We study theoretically and experimentally the modulational instability of broad optical beams in
photorefractive nonlinear media. We demonstrate the impact of the anisotropy of the nonlinearity on
the growth rate of periodic perturbations. Our ﬁndings are conﬁrmed by experimental measurements
in a strontium barium niobate photorefractive crystal.

A plane wave propagating in a medium with focusing
nonlinearity is unstable with respect to the generation
of small scale ﬁlaments [1]. This so called modulational
instability (MI) phenomenon, has been extensively stud-
ied because of its importance as a factor limiting the
propagation of high power beams. Filamentation may
also be identiﬁed as the ﬁrst stage in the development of
turbulent ﬂuctuations in the transverse proﬁle of a laser
beam[2].
In addition, MI is often considered as a pre-
cursor for the formation of spatial and/or temporal op-
tical solitons. As far as optics is concerned, MI has been
studied in media with various mechanisms of nonlinear
response including cubic [1], quadratic [3], nonlocal [4, 5]
and inertial [6, 7] types of nonlinearity. Importantly, MI
is not restricted to nonlinear optics but has also been
studied in many other nonlinear systems including ﬂuids
[8], plasmas [9] and matter waves [10].

In the context of optical beam propagation in nonlin-
ear materials MI has usually been considered in media
with spatially isotropic nonlinear properties. Recently a
great deal of theoretical and experimental eﬀorts have
been devoted to studies of nonlinear optical eﬀects and
soliton formation in photorefractive crystals [11, 12, 13].
While these media exhibit strong nonlinearity at very
low optical power their nonlinear response is inherently
anisotropic [14]. The anisotropy causes a number of ob-
servable eﬀects including astigmatic self-focusing of opti-
cal beams [15], elliptically shaped solitary solutions[16],
geometry-sensitive interactions of solitons [17], and ﬁxed
optical pattern orientation [18].

Several previous studies of MI in the context of pho-
torefractive media were limited to a 1-dimensional geom-
etry where the anisotropy is absent [19, 20, 21], and the
physics is similar to the standard saturable nonlinear-
ity [22]. On the other hand, in a real physical situation
where one deals with ﬁnite sized beams, the anisotropic
aspects of the photorefractive nonlinear response are ex-
pected to play a signiﬁcant role. Some previous work
[23, 24] already indicated the importance of anisotropy
in the transversal break-up of broad beams propagat-
ing in biased photorefractive crystals. However, no de-
tailed analysis of this phenomenon was carried out. In

this paper we study the MI of optical beams in photore-
fractive media taking into account the full 2-dimensional
anisotropic model of the photorefractive nonlinearity.

and n = n0 + n2(r, z) is the refractive index, with n0 the
spatially uniform background index, and n2 the spatially
varying nonlinear increment.

In the case of a photorefractive screening nonlinear-
ity the optical beam propagates through a photorefrac-
tive crystal externally biased with a DC electric ﬁeld.
The beam excites charges which after migrating due to
diﬀusion and drift in the applied ﬁeld, are subsequently
trapped by impurity or defect centers. The eﬀective non-
linearity (refractive index change) is proportional to the
low frequency electric ﬁeld E created by light induced
charge redistribution [11, 12, 14]. In the situation of in-
terest here where the optical ﬁeld is linearly polarized
along ˆx which coincides with the crystalline ˆc axis the
nonlinear increment to the refractive index is given by
n2(r, z) =
0r33Ex(r, z), with r33 the relevant compo-
nent of the electro-optic tensor, and Ex the ˆx component
of the low frequency electric ﬁeld in the medium.

Equation (3) describes the most general situation when
the electrostatic potential in the crystal is induced by
two distinct transport mechanisms: drift of charges in
the biasing DC ﬁeld plus photogalvanic ﬁeld and their
diﬀusion. The relative strength of the diﬀusion and drift
terms is determined by the dimensionless parameter

where Γ represents the growth rate of the perturbation
characterized by the transverse wavevector q, and fre-
quency detuning Ω.

The diﬀusion contribution which leads to spatially asym-
metric stimulated scattering dominates at large trans-
verse wavenumbers of order kD. On the other hand the
drift terms give the dominant contribution to the spa-
tially symmetric MI which is prominent at much smaller
transverse wavenumbers. Thus the term proportional to
α in Eq. (3) is often neglected when studying MI.

a photorefractive crystal as given in the appendix. The
growth rate depends strongly on the angular orientation
of the initial perturbation. In particular, it always attains
the largest value when the wave vector of the perturba-
tion coincides with the direction of the applied electric
ﬁeld (θ = 0). As θ departs from zero the ampliﬁcation of
the perturbation decreases, and the growth rate becomes
less strongly peaked at small q. The growth rate is an
even function of q provided Ω = 0 and inspection of Eq.
(7) shows that it falls of for large q as 1/q. Interestingly
Eq.(7) predicts there is no instability for perturbations
with wave vectors perpendicular to the direction of the

a function of q in the presence of a frequency shift.

Finally we note that the angular dependence takes on
a simple form in the small q limit where the diﬀusion
contribution can be neglected. Putting α = ξ = 0 in (7)

This latter expression shows clearly the decline of the

In order to verify the reliability of the linear approx-
imation discussed above we resorted to numerical anal-
ysis of the full 2-dimensional model governing propaga-
tion of optical beams in a photorefractive medium Eqs.

(2,3). For simplicity and comparison with the experi-
mental conditions discussed below we only considered the
frequency degenerate (Ω = 0) and short Debye length
(α = ξ = 0) limit. We also assumed the lack of a pho-
togalvanic eﬀect (Eph = 0). We used a split step Fast
Fourier transform code to solve the propagation equa-
tion (2) and a ﬁnite diﬀerence technique to ﬁnd the elec-
trostatic potential and refractive index change induced
by the beam. Results of these calculations are shown
in Fig.(3-5).
In all cases the direction of the applied
DC ﬁeld is horizontal (along the x-axis). In Fig.(3) we
show a few examples of numerical simulations depicting
results of propagation of the wide Gaussian beam with
initial random perturbation of its amplitude, for a few
values of the beams peak intensity. These graphs illus-
trate the inherently anisotropic nature of the instability.
Initially random perturbations lead to ampliﬁcation of
the perturbation with almost zero y-component of the
wave vector. This leads to appearance of beam modu-
lation in the form of roughly vertically oriented stripes.
Graphs in the bottom row display the spatial spectrum
(a zero frequency component has been removed for clar-
ity of presentation) of the resulting intensity distribution.
Notice that the spatial frequency with the highest growth
rate varies with the peak intensity of the beam, which is
in agreement with the prediction of Eq. (8). For compar-
ison Fig.4 shows the intensity distribution obtained with
the Gaussian beam propagating in a standard isotropic
saturable medium. The beam experiences modulational
instability but this time all ampliﬁed spatial frequencies
are located on a ring reﬂecting the isotropic nature of the
nonlinear process.

The complete absence of instability for θ = π/2 and
its apparent one-dimensional character as depicted in
Fig.(3) are a direct consequence of the anisotropy of
the nonlinear response of the photorefractive medium.
The light induced focusing power is roughly three times
stronger in the direction of the applied DC ﬁeld than
in the direction perpendicular to it [15]. Unlike the
isotropic system where all spatial frequencies correspond-

ing to highest growth rate are ampliﬁed (Fig.4), in the
photorefractive crystal the highest gain is experienced
0). Therefore
only by perturbations with qy ≈
only these frequencies will contribute to the initial stages
of the modulational instability described by the linear
theory. Spatial perturbations with nonzero qy compo-
nents have much weaker growth rates and will play an
0
important role only after the 1D structure with qy ≈
has reached suﬃciently high intensity[18]. Then the full
2-dimensional break-up and subsequent ﬁlamentation of
the beam will follow [23, 25]. However, the full analy-
sis of such a process is beyond the scope of the present
paper.

Next we simulated propagation of a broad Gaussian
beam with its amplitude perturbed by a spatially pe-
riodic modulation. The angle θ which determines the
angular orientation of the perturbation with respect to
the direction of applied DC ﬁeld was varied from θ = 0
to θ = 90◦. The strength of the perturbation (relative
to the peak intensity of the beam) was less than 10−2.
Results of the propagation of this beam over a distance
of ﬁve millimetres are shown in Fig.5. Each row of this
ﬁgure corresponds to a diﬀerent spatial frequency of the
initial perturbation. A decrease in the ampliﬁcation of
the perturbation with increasing angle θ is evident.

light intensity distribution; (b) spatial spectrum (with zero

biasing DC ﬁeld Eext = 3kV /cm. DC ﬁeld applied in hor-
izontal direction. The width of the experimental window is
320µ × 320µ

applied along the 5 mm long ˆc-axis. The optical beam
(1mW) from a solid state laser (λ = 532 nm) was loosely
focused at the input face of the crystal. The output inten-
sity distribution was imaged by a CCD camera and stored
in a computer. The crystal was illuminated by a broad
white light beam which was used to control the degree of
saturation. Typically, the peak intensity of the incident
beam was of the same order as the average intensity of
the white light background. We used either an unper-
turbed beam or beam with superimposed weak periodic
perturbations. Results of the experiments are shown in
Fig.6-7. Fig.6(a) shows the light intensity distribution at
the exit facet of the crystal (after 10 mm of propagation)
in the case where the incoming beam was not intention-
ally perturbed.
It is evident that nonlinearity induces
modulational instability which leads to the formation of
quasi 1-dimensional vertical stripes oriented perpendicu-
larly to the direction of the applied DC ﬁeld. Figure 6 (b)
depicts the corresponding Fourier spectrum of the outgo-
ing beam where the two distinct peaks with almost zero
qy components clearly indicate the anisotropic character
of the instability. The presence of the small y-component
in the spectrum is the result of a slight misalignment of
the crystal.

biasing electric ﬁeld applied along horizontal (x) direction.
The size of the computational window is 200µ × 200µ.

To verify our theoretical ﬁndings we conducted exper-
iments using a crystal of photorefractive strontium bar-
ium niobate as the nonlinear medium. The experimental
setup is analogous to that used in our earlier studies of
photorefractive soliton formation [13]. The crystal was
5x5x10 mm in size with the optical beam propagating
along the 10 mm axis and a DC electric ﬁeld of 1.1 kV

FIG. 7: Experimentally observed dependence of the modula-
tional instability of the broad Gaussian beam on the angu-
lar orientation of initial periodic perturbation. Amplitude of
the external DC electric ﬁeld Eext = 2.2kV /cm Field applied
along the horizontal direction.

Finally we investigated the role of anisotropy in mod-

ulational instability of a broad beam with an initially
imposed periodic perturbation. To this end the incom-
ing Gaussian beam was initially transmitted through a
parallel plate which resulted in the appearance of a weak
spatial periodic modulation of the beam wavefront. By
rotating the plate we were able to change the orienta-
tion of this modulation. The perturbed beam subse-
quently propagated through the biased photorefractive
crystal. Results of this experiment are shown in Fig.7.
Grey scale plots in the top row of this ﬁgure represent
the light intensity distribution at the output face of the
photorefractive crystal corresponding to diﬀerent angu-
lar orientations of the periodic pattern characterized by
the angle (θ). Graphs in the bottom row illustrate the
corresponding intensity proﬁle. As Fig.(7) clearly shows
the ampliﬁcation of the perturbation decreases rapidly as
the angle departs from θ = 0. The rightmost plot shows
the intensity pattern at the input face of the crystal. For
better visualisation we plot in Fig. 8 the experimentally
measured growth rate (normalized to its maximum value)
as a function of the angle θ. The points represent exper-
imental data while the line is a theoretical ﬁt (Eq.(8)
with Eph = 0, A0 = 2.6, ξ = 0.42, α = 0 and q = 0.35.
Again, the drop in ampliﬁcation of the perturbation for
increasing θ is evident.

In conclusion, we investigated modulational instability
of plane waves and ﬁnite beams in photorefractive non-
linear media biased with a DC electric ﬁeld. We showed
that the growth rate of perturbation is aﬀected by the in-
herent anisotropy of the nonlinear response. It is highest
for perturbations whose wave-vectors correspond to the
direction of the biasing DC ﬁeld. For arbitrarily oriented
perturbations the eﬀect of anisotropy manifests itself in
a decrease of the eﬀective strength of the nonlinear re-
sponse until it reaches zero for wave-vectors perpendic-
ular to the direction of the ﬁeld. Our theoretical pre-

dictions were conﬁrmed by experimental observations in
strontium barium niobate crystals.

In the situation of interest here where the optical
ﬁeld is linearly polarized along ˆx the nonlinear incre-
ment to the refractive index is given by n2(r, z) =
0r33Ex(r, z), with r33 the relevant component of the
−
electro-optic tensor, and Ex the ˆx component of the
low frequency electric ﬁeld in the medium. In a parax-
ial approximation the optical ﬁeld therefore satisﬁes the
parabolic equation

Within the same paraxial approximation we drop the lon-

We can calculate characteristic values for the theo-
retical parameters for the SBN crystal used in the ex-
perimental work. Using data from Ref.

With a typical applied ﬁeld of Eext = 2.2 kV/cm we have
lk = 350 µm, l⊥ = 2.5 µm, α = 0.046, and ξ = 0.42.

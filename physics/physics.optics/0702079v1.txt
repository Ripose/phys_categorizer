A small depression is created in a straight optical ﬁber taper to form a local probe suitable for
studying closely spaced, planar microphotonic devices. The tension of the “dimpled” taper controls
the probe-sample interaction length and the level of noise present during coupling measurements.
Practical demonstrations with high-Q silicon microcavities include testing a dense array of undercut
microdisks (maximum Q = 3.3×106) and a planar microring (Q = 4.8×106).

INTRODUCTION

In microelectronics manufacturing, nondestructive
parametric testing using metal probe tips greatly in-
creases fabrication yield through statistical process con-
trol [1]. For testing of glass and semiconductor photonic
lightwave circuits (PLCs), many methods exist for the
coupling of light into and out of on-chip waveguides [2].
However, no simple, local probe exists for wafer-scale,
nondestructive, optical characterization of on-chip com-
ponents. Traditional optical coupling methods include
end-ﬁre or butt coupling [3, 4, 5] and prism-based cou-
pling [6, 7]. End-ﬁre coupling from free-space or opti-
cal ﬁbers can be made highly eﬃcient, even to high-
index contrast semiconductor waveguides, through the
use of tapered waveguide sections [3, 4, 5] or other non-
adiabatic mode converters [8, 9], but they are limited to
coupling at the periphery of the chip where a cleaved
facet can be formed. Evanescent-coupling methods in-
volving conventional prism couplers, angled-ﬁber tip cou-
plers [10], eroded-ﬁber couplers [11], and optical ﬁber
tapers [12, 13, 14], can provide eﬀective coupling to
and from on-chip waveguides, but these probes are less
suited to wafer-scale coupling to micron-scale photonic el-
ements due to their macroscopic extent in one or both in-
plane dimensions. Evanescent coupling techniques also
rely on phase-matching to obtain highly eﬃcient cou-
pling [15, 16, 17], which can be diﬃcult (although not im-
possible [16, 18]) to satisfy for semiconductor-based mi-
crophotonic chips. Other methods of coupling light onto
photonic chips for characterization purposes involve ded-
icated on-chip testing structures such as in-plane grat-
ing couplers [19]. These couplers typically also involve
specialized processing to achieve high coupling eﬃciency:
blazed gratings [20], a combination of lateral and vertical
Bragg reﬂectors [21], or additional overlayers [22].

We present a variant of the silica optical ﬁber taper
evanescent-coupler that is designed for rapid, wafer-scale
diagnostic testing of on-chip photonic components such
as waveguides and resonant ﬁlters. Previous work involv-
ing straight ﬁber tapers required devices to be elevated
by several microns above the chip surface to prevent par-
asitic coupling to the surrounding substrate. Macroscop-
ically curved ﬁber taper probes [23, 24, 25, 26] have been

demonstrated which reduce parasitic loss into the sub-
strate. However, they tend to be less mechanically sta-
ble than their tensioned straight-taper counterparts and
suﬀer from noise induced by ﬂuctuations in the taper’s
position. In this work we have developed a microscopic
“dimpled” ﬁber taper probe which allows for low-noise lo-
cal probing of individual devices on a wafer. By increas-
ing the tension in the taper, ﬂuctuations in the taper-
chip gap can be greatly reduced to the levels present
in straight ﬁber taper measurements. To demonstrate
the utility of the dimpled taper optical probe, we de-
scribe the characterization of two types of devices on a
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer platform: a dense two-
dimensional array of high-Q silicon microdisk resonators
and, secondly, a planar microring resonator.

THE DIMPLED FIBER-TAPER PROBE

The dimpled ﬁber taper probe is made from a stan-
dard straight ﬁber taper that is pressed against a mold
and heated. We form “straight” ﬁber tapers by simul-
taneously heating and pulling standard telecommunica-
tion ﬁber (speciﬁcally SMF-28e). By slowly thinning the
ﬁber, the fundamental core-guided ﬁber mode is adia-
batically converted to the fundamental taper mode with
evanescent tails that extend signiﬁcantly into the sur-
rounding medium. After mounting the taper in a U-
bracket [27], the narrowest part of the taper is pressed
against a silica mold with the desired radius of curva-
ture; a bare optical ﬁber with a radius of approximately
62 µm is used as the mold in these experiments. The
taper and mold are heated with a hydrogen torch and
allowed to cool. After detaching the ﬁber from the mold,
the taper retains an impression of the mold, Fig 1(b),
which forms a global minimum with respect the rest of
the taper. The dimpling process introduces negligible ad-
ditional loss, and the total loss of the dimpled taper is
typically less than 0.5 dB relative to the un-pulled opti-
cal ﬁber. Using a specially designed U-mount with a set
screw to control the tensioning, varying the taper’s ten-
sion changes the radius of curvature of the dimple. Un-
der high tension, the dimple becomes very shallow but
never completely straightens. After dimpling, the probe
is mounted onto a three-axis 50-nm-encoded stage and is

2

est point of the dimple. Since only the lowest part of the
dimple interacts with the sample, this method can only
determine the taper’s proﬁle within ∼1.25 µm of the sur-
face. Fitting the proﬁles determines the eﬀective probe
radius is 159 µm, 228 µm, and 498 µm at low, medium,
and high tension, respectively. These radii diﬀer from
the mold radius (∼62 µm) due to tensioning of the taper
and how the ﬁber detaches from the mold after heating.
To study the resonators in the following demonstra-
tions, the devices were excited using ﬁber-coupled swept
tunable-laser sources (spanning 1423–1496 nm and 1495–
1565 nm, linewidth < 300 kHz over the 25-ms time scale
needed to scan across a high-Q resonance) and a paddle-
wheel polarization controller to selectively couple to TE-
like and TM-like modes. To measure the intrinsic qual-
ity factor, the cavities are weakly loaded by the dim-
pled probe and excited at low power. Without any op-
tical ampliﬁcation, the signal is acquired using a high-
speed photodetector, electrically ampliﬁed using a low-
noise analog preampliﬁer, and then is saved by a analog-
to-digital converter. For measured Q > 106 (linewidth
δλ . 1.5 pm), the linewidth measurement is immediately
calibrated with a ﬁber-optic Mach-Zehnder interferome-
ter to an accuracy of ±0.01 pm.

NOISE MEASUREMENTS

Because evanescent coupling to ﬁber tapers is exponen-
tially dependent on position, ﬁber-taper measurements
are very susceptible to any noise sources that produce
physical displacements of the taper. For straight tapers,
increasing tension to reducing these ﬂuctuations is com-
mon, and the U-mount [27] naturally provides the appro-
priate tautness. Isolating the measurements from stray
air currents is also imperative—typically all testing is
conducted in a continuously N2-purged enclosure. Under
standard testing conditions at low dimple-taper tension
[Fig. 3(a)], coupling to the mode of a microdisk resonator
[see Fig. 1(a) and Section ] varies signiﬁcantly between
consecutive scans. Increasing the tension makes the cou-
pling depth much more reproducible, as in Fig. 3(b). At
tensions that give acceptable noise levels, the depth of the
dimple is still adequate for testing densely-spaced planar
devices.

To quantitatively study the noise, we measure non-
resonant insertion loss as a function of time. The dimple
is placed above the etched GaAs mesa so that approxi-
mately 60 percent of the incident power is coupled into
the substrate. The mesa structure assures a constant
11.6-µm interaction length for diﬀerent taper tensions.
We minimize the electrical noise contribution by maxi-
mizing the incident optical power in order to decrease the
needed electrical gain and ﬁltering. We also eliminate
extraneous noise sources (unused computers, monitors,
overhead lights, etc.) and turn oﬀ the N2 ﬂow into the

fusion-spliced into a versatile ﬁber-optic setup. During
testing, devices are placed in the near-ﬁeld of the probe,
as in Fig. 1(a,c); adjustments to a pair of goniometers en-
sure the straight run of the taper is parallel to the sample
surface.

Measurement of the non-resonant insertion loss as the
waveguide is moved relative to nearby semiconductor mi-
crostructures gives the eﬀective interaction length and
proﬁle of the local probe. First, we record the loss as
a 1.6-µm wide GaAs cantilever is scanned along the ta-
per’s length while holding the taper at a ﬁxed height. At
tensions used in standard testing, Fig. 2(a) shows only
∼20 µm (full width at half max) of the taper at the bot-
tom of the dimple is close enough to interact with the
sample. Second, the loss is measured as a function of
the probe’s height above a 11.6-µm wide GaAs mesa.
By assuming an exponential vertical dependence for the
insertion loss [Fig. 2(b)], we convert the loss’s axial de-
pendence [Fig. 2(a)] into the probe’s “near-ﬁeld” proﬁle
[Fig. 2(c)]—i.e. the height of the taper relative to the low-

testing enclosure. To obtain a background spectrum that
is independent of any taper displacement, the dimple is
raised so no power is coupled into the substrate, and then
the power is attenuated to give the same output voltage
from the detector. The resulting noise power spectra
in Fig. 3(c) reveal increasing tension reduces broadband
noise between approximately 10 and 1000 Hz, reﬂecting
the relevant time-scales for scanning across a high-Q res-
onance. The series of high-frequency peaks at ∼15.8 kHz
occur at the pulse-position-modulation clock frequency
of the stage motor controller. The dominant spike at
low frequencies is bimodal with peaks at ∼120 Hz and
∼130 Hz with a total bandwidth of ∼20 Hz. The motor
controller also contributes to noise in this band, but it
is not the dominant noise source. We hypothesize that
electrical noise actuates the motors and drives low-Q vi-
brational modes of the ﬁber taper. By measuring inser-
tion loss as a function of the dimple-substrate gap and
comparing it to noisy time-domain transmission traces,
we estimate the upper bound on ﬂuctuations in the ta-
per height to be 7.9 ± 1.4 nm, which is consistent with
our earlier measurements with straight tapers.

CHARACTERIZATION: MICRODISK ARRAY

To demonstrate the dimpled taper’s ability to test
closely spaced devices, we study a 5×5 array of sili-
con microdisks [Fig. 1(c)] with disk diameters of 10 µm
and periodicity of 20 µm—corresponding to an areal den-
sity of 2.5×105 cm−2. Undercut microdisks were chosen
over planar resonators to ease phase matching between
the cavity and taper modes. The microdisks were fab-
ricated from silicon-on-insulator with a 217-nm device
layer [h100i orientation, p-type, 14–20 Ω·cm] and a 2-µm
SiO2 buried oxide layer (BOX). The resonators were de-
ﬁned using electron-beam lithography, resist reﬂow, and
reactive ion etching; then the disks were partially un-

dercut by etching the buried oxide using dilute HF. The
silicon surfaces are temporarily hydrogen passivated us-
ing repeated Piranha/HF treatments. Long-term pas-
sivation is achieved using a 3-nm dry thermal oxide cap
grown in O2 at 1000◦C followed by a 3-hour anneal in N2
at 1000◦C and then a 1.5-hour slow cool down in N2 from
1000◦C to 400◦C. For details on the lithography, chemi-
cal passivation, and oxide passivation, see Refs. [28], [29],
and [30], respectively.

Near 1532 nm, we track three TE-like modes of diﬀer-
ent radial orders [p = 1–3 in Fig. 4(a)] across all 25 disks
in the array. One disk supported no high-Q whispering-
gallery modes in the range spanning 1495–1565 nm, and
we were unable to couple to the TE p = 1 mode in two
other disks—most likely because their Q was too low to
overcome the phase mismatch with the taper mode. In
Fig. 4(b), varying the disk-taper coupling through their
separation practically demonstrates the level of displace-
ment noise present in these measurements; each circle
represents the transmission minimum for an individual
scan at the given probe position. Table I summarizes
the average measured wavelength (λo), quality factor,
and doublet [28] splitting (∆λ) for each mode; the distri-
butions of wavelength and quality factor [31] appear in
Fig. 4(a). The highest Q for a single standing wave mode
is 3.3×106 with Q/V = 2.3×105 for a calculated mode
volume V = 14.09 (λ/n)3. With minimal free-carrier ab-
sorption in the bulk [32] , the modal loss likely has sig-
niﬁcant contributions from both surface absorption and
surface scattering since the ratio of the doublet splitting
(related to the surface scattering rate) over the resonance
linewidth varies from 3.1 to 28.1 for modes with Q > 106.
The spatial arrangement of the mode parameters across
the array [Fig. 4(d–f)] shows a systematic change in λo
and more random variations in Q and ∆λ. The λo dis-
tribution implies the sample was slightly tilted with re-
spect the beam writer’s focal plane. Similar geographic
patterns exist for the parameters of the p = 2 and p = 3

CHARACTERIZATION: PLANAR MICRORING

Testing planar devices is accomplished in the same
fashion. Non-undercut microring resonators, shown in
Fig. 5(a), were fabricated from SOI with a 195-nm sili-
con device layer and a 3-µm BOX. The same lithography,
resist reﬂow, and dry etching procedure used for the mi-
crodisks [28] was used to deﬁne the microrings although
without the ﬁnal HF undercut. Repeated Piranha oxida-
tions and HF dips are again used to chemically passivate
the surfaces prior to thermal oxidation [29]; these treat-
ments also slightly undercut the resonators [Fig. 5(b)].
Finally, a 30-nm dry thermal oxide was grown as a cap-
ping layer, and the microring sample was annealed ac-
cording to the same N2 schedule as the microdisks [30].
Microrings are slightly more diﬃcult to test with ﬁber
tapers than undercut microdisks. A large phase mis-
match exists between the taper and microcavity be-
cause of the extra dielectric beneath the Si-core guided
modes. With the taper in contact with the ring, the

ments and 30-nm thermal oxidation: (a) top-view of a ring

coupling depth is more than suﬃcient to assess the de-
vices’ optical loss characteristics. However, the coupling
is not adequate to eﬃciently excite and collect emission
from active devices [17]. For applications requiring high

pump/collection eﬃciency, photonic crystal waveguides
can be used to overcome the poor phase matching be-
tween the modes in the taper and the modes in the on-
chip device [16].

Figure 5(c) shows a transmission spectrum of a ring
with an 80-µm diameter and 2-µm width after the ﬁ-
nal chemical treatments and thermal oxidation. The
measured quality factor of 4.8×106 (loss coeﬃcient α <
0.1 dB/cm) represents the highest quality factor for any
planar microresonator to date. Reproducing Qs found
previously only in relatively thick and undercut silicon
disks [28] is promising for the future development of PLCs
with high-Q silicon microresonators integrated with bus
waveguides.

CONCLUSIONS

Using a dimpled ﬁber taper waveguide, we have
demonstrated a localized optical probe capable of testing
dense arrays of planar devices. Proper tensioning makes
the dimpled taper more robust against ﬂuctuations in po-
sition and decreases broadband noise. Even without ded-
icated test structures to ease phase-matching constraints,
the local dimpled-taper probe enables nondestructive
wafer-scale optical characterization for manufacturer-
level statistical process control. Higher yields through
low-cost testing will become increasingly important in a
growing market where the burgeoning demand for band-
width is making integrated micro-electronic-photonic so-
lutions more attractive [34].

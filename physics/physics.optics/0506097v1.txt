Abstract

Expressions corresponding to the transmission of a uniaxial optically active crystal
platelet are provided for an optical axis parallel and perpendicular to the plane
of interface. The optical activity is taken into account by a consistent multipolar
expansion of the crystal medium response due to the path of an electromagnetic
wave. Numerical examples of the eﬀect of the optical activity are given for quartz
platelets of chosen thicknesses. The optical activity’s eﬀects on the variations of
the transmission of quartz platelets as a function of the angle of incidence is also
investigated.

Key words: optical activity, uniaxial crystal

1 Introduction

Optical activity in crystals is a phenomenon which has been known for a long
time (see Ref. [1] for an historical review). Two methods are currently used
to describe the eﬀect of the crystal optical activity on plane wave propaga-
tion. The ﬁrst one is phenomenological and is valid under normal incidence
[2,3,4,5,6,7]. The second one is a ﬁrst principle method and consists in solving
the Maxwell equations with modiﬁed constitutive equations [1,8,9,10] (i.e. the
relationship between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds vectors and the electric

displacement and magnetic induction ﬁeld vectors). The choice of the consti-
tutive equations is of prior importance [9] and was itself of phenomenological
nature until the link between the optical activity as well as the magnetic-
dipole and electric-octupole responses of the crystal medium was consistently
formalised[11,12]. This theory leads to constitutive equations diﬀerent from
those previously used. To the author’s knowledge, the constitutive equations
of Ref. [11] have not yet been used to calculate the transmission matrix of
an optical active uniaxial platelet. They were only applied to describe the
reﬂection of a plane wave by an interface between an isotropic achiral and a
uniaxial chiral media [13], but for an optical axis parallel or perpendicular to
the plane of incidence. It is the purpose of this article to provide this trans-
mission matrix in a simple and usable form. We further restrict ourselves to
two geometric conﬁgurations often encountered experimentally, namely the
optical axis parallel and perpendicular to the plane of interface.

Recent experimental results have shown that the contribution of the optical
activity to the transmission matrix of a quarter wave plate can reach the per-
cent level [6]. As an application of our transmission matrix formula, the origin
of this eﬀect is investigated and the case of half wave plates is also considered.
Our formula being valid under oblique incidence, numerical calculations of
the variations of the platelet transmission matrix as a function of the angle of
incidence are presented.

In section 2 we describe the method. In section 3, we derive the explicit expres-
sions of the platelet transmission matrix for oblique and normal incidences.
The contribution of the optical activity to the transmission matrix is studied
numerically for various quartz platelet thicknesses in section 4.

2 Formalism

A monochromatic plane wave of wavelength λ impinging a uniaxial optically
active crystal slab of thickness ℓ is considered. The crystal is assumed to be
non-absorbing, non-magnetic and surrounded by an isotropic achiral ambient
medium.

A direct axis system x, y, z is deﬁned such that the z axis is perpendicular
to the plane of interface. The origin of the z axis (i.e. z = 0) is ﬁxed on
the ﬁrst plane of interface so that z = ℓ corresponds to the second plane of
interface (see Fig. 1). The unit vector basis attached to the system axes is
denoted
.Without loss of generality, the plane of incidence is taken to
be yz. To determine the transmission and reﬂection matrices of the interfaces
between the ambient medium and the crystal faces, we follow the method of
Ref. [14].

3 Transmission matrix of a platelet with the optical axis parallel

and perpendicular to the plane of interface

Quartz crystal is widely used in crystallography to test the reliability of ex-
perimental setups [7,6] and to manufacture retardation plates. We thus re-
strict ourselves to the non-centrosymmetric crystals belonging to the symme-
try classes 32, 422 and 622 [2,15] for which the tensors
have similar
expressions [13]. In the crystallographic reference frame, i.e for the crystal
optical axis aligned along the z axis, the non-vanishing components of these
tensors are [13,15]:

in the planes z = 0 and z = ℓ. For an oblique incidence, these calculations
are more simply performed numerically. Compact analytical expressions are
obtained for the special case of normal incidence and will be given bellow.

To deﬁne a platelet transmission matrix at ﬁrst order in gij/∆, we introduce
the three matrices R0, T0 and T ′
0 obtained by setting g11 = g33 = 0 to zero in
the expressions of R, T and T respectively. We then deﬁne the matrices δR,
and δT and δT ′ such that R = R0 + δR, T = T0 + δT and T ′ = T ′
0 + δT .
Having thus isolated the zero order from the ﬁrst order terms in gij/∆, we
deﬁne the platelet transmission matrix M = M0 + δM and thereby

Eout = E(0)

out + δEout such E(0)

out = M0Ein, δEout = δMEin.

In these expressions, terms in g11 are enhanced, unlike those in g33, by a factor
1/(ne −
1. This is a major diﬀerence with the case of an optical axis
perpendicular to the plane of interface (see next section). From Eqs. (26-27)
one also sees that the contribution of g33 to the transmission matrix becomes
noticeable only under oblique incidence.

Let us mention that Eq. (34) agrees with the result of Ref. [9] for an isotropic
chirality, i.e. g11 = g33. It is however in disagreement with the expression of
Ref. [10] obtained using phenomenological constitutive equations. The expres-
sion of our platelet transmission matrix therefore disagrees with the one of
Refs. [17,18].

The zero and ﬁrst order platelet transmission matrices are given by Eqs. (30)
and (29) respectively. For Eq. (30), we obtain the following simple expression[19]:

Note that the interface matrices of eq. (39) do not depend explicitly of the
coeﬃcients g11 and g33. Thereby, the variations of M with these coeﬃcients
come only from the phases ϕo and ϕe. Note as well that the coeﬃcient g11
contributes only under oblique incidence.

4 Numerical results

To estimate the eﬀects of the gyration coeﬃcients on the platelet transmission,
an experience closed to the HAUP[7] is considered: a linearly polarised He-Ne
laser beam crosses a quartz platelet and then a supposed perfect analyser. The
incident electric vector reads Ein = (cos ψ, sin ψ)T in the
basis (i.e. in
under normal incidence, see Fig. 1). After the analyser, whose
the basis
eigen axis corresponds to, say, the x axis, the beam intensity is measured as
a function of ψ and φ.

We ﬁrst consider the normal incidence and a crystal optical axis parallel to
the plane of interface. As for the plate thickness, two values are chosen: ℓ1 =
87.80µm and ℓ2 = 1000.93µm (i.e. a ﬁrst and a fourteen order quarter wave
plates).

The intensity Ix is shown as a function of ψ and φ in Fig. 2 (it is similar for

I0x is shown as a function of φ and ψ for the plate

high for ψ
π/4 and the same behaviour is indeed observed for the second
plate thickness ℓ2. In the expression of I0x, the contribution of the optical
activity comes only from the phases ϕo and ϕe.

∆0x is identical to Fig. 4 but scaled by a factor of ten. As expected, the chiral
dependence induced by the phase shift alone becomes only sizeable for thick
plates.

plate thickness ℓ3 = 1018.49µm, i.e. a fourteen order half wave plate. Ix, ∆x

and ∆0x are shown as a function of φ and ψ in Figs. 5, 6 and 7 respectively.
The eﬀect induced by the optical activity is here reduced by two orders of
magnitude with respect to a quarter wave plate and is dominated by the
variation of the phases ϕo and ϕe with g11. For a ﬁrst order half wave plate
(ℓ4 = 105.36µm), the eﬀect on ∆0x is reduced by an order of magnitude
whereas ∆x is essentially unchanged.

As mentioned in section 3.1, under normal incidence and for the optical axis
parallel to the plane of interface, the contribution of the optical activity to
the platelet transmission matrix comes essentially from the coeﬃcient g11. The
contribution of the coeﬃcient g33 appears under oblique incidence and can, a
priori, be distinguished from the other one by considering various angles of
incidence. We now consider the ratio r = Is/Ip where Is and Ip are obtained
by substituting ˆs and ˆp to ˆx in Eq. (40) respectively. To reproduce the ex-
perimental results of Ref. [6], we also ﬁx ψ = π/4, i.e. Ein = (1, 1)T /√2. The
ratio r is shown as a function of φ and θ for the plate thickness ℓ1 in Fig.
8. To distinguish the contributions from g11 and g33, we show in Figs. 9 and
r1)/r where r0 and
10 the relative diﬀerences δr = (r
r1 are obtained by setting g11 = g33 = 0 and g11 = 0 in the expression of
r respectively. From these ﬁgures, one sees that, as reported in Ref. [6], the
contribution of the optical activity reach the percent level for certain values
of φ.

In addition, we observe here that the contribution of g33 is negligible under
normal incidence but reaches the few 10−3 level for reasonable values of the
angle of incidence. The shape of the contribution of g11 and g33 being diﬀerent,
it seems possible to determine both coeﬃcients by measuring r as a function
of φ for various angles of incidence.

We ﬁnally consider the case of an optical axis perpendicular to the plane of
interface. We choose ℓ5 = 1000µm for the plate thickness and, as previously,
Ein = (1, 1)T /√2 for the incident electric vector. In addition to δr, we in-
troduce the phase angle α deﬁned by the argument of the complex number
(Eout
α0 where α0 is obtained by
setting g11 = 0 in the expression of Eout. Figs. 11 and 12 show δr and ∆α as

As in the case of an optical axis parallel to the plane of interface, the mea-
surements of r and ∆α as function of the angle of incidence lead to the de-
termination of both g11 and g33. The sensitivity to these parameters is even
higher when the optical axis is perpendicular to the plane of interface.

5 Conclusion

The transmission matrix for a uniaxial and chiral platelet has been calcu-
lated for an optical axis parallel and perpendicular to the plane of interface.
The optical activity has been taken into account by considering the electric-
quadrupole and magnetic-dipole responses of the crystal medium. Simple and
usable expressions have been derived for normal incidence and for the optical
axis parallel and perpendicular to the plane of interface. The case of an oblique
incidence has been treated partly analytically and partly numerically.

As an application, numerical studies of the transmission of quartz platelets of
various thicknesses have been provided. Under normal incidence, it was shown
that the contribution of the optical activity can reach the percent level for
quarter wave plates, independently of the plate’s order. Such a high contribu-
tion was found to be due to the transmission and reﬂection interface matrices.
The case of half wave plates was also investigated and, unlike quarter wave
plates, the main contribution of the optical activity came from the phase shift
induced by the optical path inside the crystal. The variation of the intensity
after a quartz platelet was studied as a function of the angle of incidence and
of the orientation of the optical axis. A sensitivity to both gyration coeﬃ-
cients g11 and g33 was observed under oblique incidence. This suggests that
varying the angle of incidence one could determine experimentally these two

16

coeﬃcients with a unique crystal cut. With respect to the results of Ref. [22],
oblique incidence also oﬀers the possibility to determine very accurately the
platelet thickness and thereby the gyration coeﬃcients.

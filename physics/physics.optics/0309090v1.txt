Abstract. We explain the main concepts centered around Sharafutdinov’s ray
transform, its kernel, and the extent to which it can be inverted. It is shown how
the ray transform emerges naturally in any attempt to reconstruct optical and
stress tensors within a photoelastic medium from measurements on the state of
polarization of light beams passing through the strained medium. The problem of
reconstruction of stress tensors is crucially related to the fact that the ray transform
has a nontrivial kernel; the latter is described by a theorem for which we provide
a new proof which is simpler and shorter as in Sharafutdinov’s original work, as
we limit our scope to tensors which are relevant to Photoelasticity. We explain how
the kernel of the ray transform is related to the decomposition of tensor ﬁelds into
longitudinal and transverse components. The merits of the ray transform as a tool
for tensor reconstruction are studied by walking through an explicit example of
reconstructing the σ33-component of the stress tensor in a cylindrical photoelastic
specimen. In order to make the paper self-contained we provide a derivation of
the basic equations of Integrated Photoelasticity which describe how the presence of
stress within a photoelastic medium inﬂuences the passage of polarized light through
the material.

1. Introduction

A transparent optical medium which initially is isotropic and homoge-
neous with respect to light propagation may become birefringent when
subjected to external strain, an eﬀect which is known as Photoelastic-
ity [1, 2]. The spatially varying tensor of refraction then reﬂects the
presence of stresses within the material, opening up the possibility
of examining internal stresses by means of the change in the state
of polarization of light beams passing through the strained medium.
The reconstruction of local optical and stress tensors from the set of
data collected for all possible directions, and locations, of light beams
passing through the specimen is called Integrated Photoelasticity [3].

Numerous eﬀorts have been made in the past to tackle the problem
of Integrated Photoelasticity [3–12]. While the reconstruction of the
optical tensors in the two-dimensional problem is well-established (for
an overview see [5]), the three-dimensional (3D) case so far has been
solved only for special cases involving a priori assumptions about the
symmetry of the 3D stress distribution, the rotation of the principal
axes of the stress tensor, or the strength of the anisotropy of the di-
electric tensor. The most general case of 3D tensor tomography with
arbitrarily shaped bulk matter and no restriction on the degree of
anisotropy is unsolved. The source of diﬃculty is the fact that the
Radon transform which provides a well-established formalism for the
reconstruction of scalar ﬁelds can no longer be utilized if tensor ﬁelds
are involved.

In [13], Sharafutdinov has proposed a generalization of the Radon
transform to the case of symmetric tensor ﬁelds of arbitrary degree m
deﬁned on a, possibly curved, Riemannian manifold of arbitrary di-
mension n; he has termed his construction the ray transform. Amongst
many other aspects, his work encompasses the examination of the for-
mal structure of the ray transform, its relation to the Fourier transform,
its non-trivial kernel and the problem of inversion of the ray transform
given the fact that the kernel is non-zero. Sharafutdinov’s contribu-
tion undoubtedly opens up the right path to the goal of solving the
general problem of Integrated Photoelasticity; however, since his work
aims to tackle the most general case of symmetric tensors of arbitrary
degree m in n dimensions, his formalism necessarily exhibits a degree
of complexity which may be undesirable for practitioners who wish
to put his theory into a speciﬁc physical or engineering context. It
is therefore an important task to lay out his results in a way which
focuses on the special case of symmetric (m = 2) tensor ﬁelds, and
vector (m = 1) ﬁelds, deﬁned in a three-dimensional Euclidean space
which is to be identiﬁed with the bulk material of the medium, and to
study the merits of the ray transform as a tool for tensor reconstruction
within the speciﬁc framework of Photoelasticity.

In the present paper we have attempted to provide some steps in
this task: We explain the main concepts related to the ray transform,
its kernel, and the extent to which it can be inverted, for the special
3. Our goal is on the
case of vector- and symmetric tensor ﬁelds in R
one hand to provide an overview of the mathematical structure of
the ray transform, and on the other hand to illustrate the method
by discussing a simple application within the ﬁeld of Integrated Pho-
toelasticity. With these objectives in mind we have performed a new
proof on one of the central theorems in Sharafutdinov’s theory, namely
the kernel of the ray transform; this theorem provides essential insight

into the degree to which optical or stress tensors can be reconstructed
from photoelastic data. Our proof focuses on vector- and symmetric
2-tensors only, which moreover are reconstructed plane-wise, so that
2. This allows us to
they are eﬀectively deﬁned on a two-dimensional R
take alternative routes in the various steps of the proof which are not
available in the most general case. This proof is given along the way
of explaining the emergence of the ray transform in photoelastic stress
reconstruction.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we derive the basic
equations of Integrated Photoelasticity governing the evolution of the
components of the electric ﬁeld vector of a polarized light beam passing
through a medium with spatially varying dielectric tensor. In section 3
we show how these equations can be used to describe the impact of
stress in a transparent material on polarized light. In section 4 we show
how the concept of the ray transform emerges as we try to reconstruct
optical and stress tensors from photoelastic measurement data. In sec-
tion 5 we characterize the kernel of the ray transform of vector and
symmetric tensor ﬁelds, providing a new proof, albeit with a narrower
scope, to Sharafutdinov’s general theorem. In section 6 we show how
the kernel of the ray transform is related to the decomposition of tensor
ﬁelds into longitudinal and transverse components and explain how this
knowledge can be utilized to reconstruct stress tensor components in
a photoelastic specimen. Finally, in section 7 we speculate about the
extension of the formalism at hand into the high-stress regime using the
Newton-Kantarovich method. In section 8 we summarize our results.

2. Basic equations of Integrated Photoelasticity

We now derive the basic equations of Integrated Photoelasticity un-
der the straight-line assumption, i.e., light rays passing through pho-
toelastic media are assumed to propagate along straight lines. This
assumption is justiﬁed as long as anisotropy is suﬃciently weak.

We wish to examine the propagation of a plane polarized electro-
magnetic wave through a weakly birefringent photoelastic medium.
The birefringence, i.e., the anisotropy of the dielectric tensor ǫij, i, j =
1, 2, 3, is assumed to be entirely resulting from the stress within the
material, such that, in the unloaded state, the material is homogeneous
and isotropic with a real dielectric tensor ǫij = ǫ δij, and ǫ = const. The
material is assumed to be unmagnetic with vacuum permeability µ0,
and non-absorbing at least in the optical range of wavelengths, so that
the material is transparent to visible light. The permittivity of vacuum
will be denoted as ǫ0.

thermore, the eﬀective charge density due to polarization eﬀects is

We now assume a harmonic time dependence

e−iωt of all ﬁelds,
and a wave propagation in the z-direction. We may neglect the x-
and y-dependence of the ﬁelds, since the electromagnetic energy in the
geometrical-optics limit propagates along narrow tubes of light rays in
such a way that, along the cross-section of a given tube, the ﬁelds may
be treated as independent of x and y. Then (4) becomes a Helmholtz
equation

Provided that birefringence is weak, i.e., the load on the material is not
too strong, the component of the electric ﬁeld in the direction ez of the
wave vector can be neglected. This leads to an Ansatz for the electric
ﬁeld as follows:

ity ǫ of the unstressed medium; this is true under the same conditions
under which the z-component of the electric ﬁeld can be neglected, i.e.

The complex two-component vector A
vector of the light beam. Eq. (10b) can be converted into an operator
equation as follows: We may partition the photoelastic medium into
many thin slices perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation
ez. Each slice acts on the Jones vector of the light beam either as
a retarder, i.e., introducing a phase shift between two orthogonally
polarized components of the wave, or as a rotator, i.e., rotating the
plane of polarization of a plane-polarized wave, or both. This implies
that each slice acts on the local Jones vector as a unitary matrix, and
hence the same must be true for the total bulk of the photoelastic

specimen. If zi is some point before the medium (possibly zi =

and zf is some point behind the medium (possibly zf = +

Jones vectors Ai and Af at these points must be related by a unitary
transformation U (zf , zi). In fact, such a transformation must exist for
any pair of points z, z′, so that we can write

3. Stress-optical relations

The stress-optical equations linking the dielectric tensor ǫij with the
stress tensor σij,

ǫij = ǫ δij + C1 σij + C2 tr σ δij

,

(14)

were discovered long ago by Maxwell [14]. Since the material is assumed
homogeneous with respect to its stress-optical properties, the quantities
C1 and C2 are constants, characterising the stress-optical properties of
the specimen. In (14), ǫij and σij depend on the spatial coordinates
(x, y, z), but ǫ is constant throughout the material, as mentioned in
section 2. Using (14) we can express the equations (10) in terms of the
stress tensor σij rather than the dielectric tensor ǫij. We start again
with (10b) and substitute (14) for the components of the dielectric
tensor in the matrix M (z); this gives

M (z) = C0

If the specimen is located such that the z-axis intersects the medium,
and z, z′ refer to points before and behind the medium, respectively,
then the matrix U (z, z′) contains all the data acquired from mea-

plane-polarized light, and the rotation of the plane of polarized light,
along that line of intersection.

4. The ray transform in Photoelasticity

We now wish to examine the stress within a cylindrical object which
occupies a cylindrical domain G = D
(a, b), where D is a two-
dimensional region in the xy-plane and the boundary ∂D of D is a
strictly convex smooth curve. By B = ∂D
(a, b) we denote the lateral
surface of the cylinder G. The stress tensor is supposed to be smooth
in G and on B, and satisﬁes the equilibrium conditions

everywhere. Furthermore, the absence of external forces on the lateral
boundary ∂B implies that

where (n1, n2, 0) is the unit outward normal to ∂B on the lateral surface
B of the cylinder. Strain is therefore applied only at the top (z = b)
and the bottom (z = a) of the object.

It is now assumed that measurements analogous to (24) are per-
X +
formed along all horizontal straight lines in R
t ξ(α), where X = (x, y, z), (x, y) varies through the points in the xy-
plane, z takes values in the interval (a, b), the angle α varies in (0, 2π),
and

generalize the measurements along the z-axis which were discussed in
section 2. For the straight line passing through the point X along the
direction ξ we now choose an adapted right-handed coordinate system
(η, z, t) in which the direction of propagation of the light beam is along
the positive t-axis (the η-coordinate line is perpendicular to the t-
coordinate line, and the new z-direction coincides with the old one).
On performing a measurement along the line so deﬁned we then obtain
quantities analogous to (25),

5. The kernel of the ray transform

i1...im and T (2)

Our task is now to reconstruct the components of the stress tensor from
the ray transforms (33) as far as possible. We shall see that, for the
given experimental setup, involving horizontal light rays only, we can
only retrieve one component of the stress tensor, namely σ33. In order to
proceed we need to understand that the ray transform, regarded as an
operator I sending symmetric tensor ﬁelds T (including ﬁelds of degree
m = 1, i.e. vector ﬁelds) T to the set of quantities IT , has a nontrivial
kernel: Given two tensor ﬁelds T (1)
i1...im, does IT (1) = IT (2)
imply T (1) = T (2)? The answer is no, as proved in a theorem in [13].
The original version of this theorem is designed to encompass the most
n, with no reference
general case of symmetric m-tensors deﬁned on R
to a speciﬁc physical application or context. Accordingly, the proof,
encumbered with this degree of generality, occupies a substantial num-
ber of pages. However, this generality is not required for the particular
purposes of reconstructing vector- and symmetric 2-tensor ﬁelds within
the context of Photoelasticity. If we limit our scope to these types of
ﬁelds, the proof of the theorem can be performed along alternative
routes which are shorter than in the original work. In this section we
provide this new proof for the two special cases of a vector ﬁeld w and
a symmetric tensor ﬁeld u deﬁned in R

Proof.

5.1.1. Case A.

The equivalence (A.b)
(A.c) is well-known in standard Vector Anal-
ysis, where (42b) expresses the fact that the vector ﬁeld wi must be
curl-free in order for a potential φ to exist. We therefore shall not prove
this equivalence here.

⇔

We now prove (A.b)

(A.a): Inserting (42a) into the ﬁrst integral

of (33) yields

Finally we prove (A.a)

(A.c): To this end we observe that the
∂2w1 is a scalar with respect to rotations in the plane
function ∂1w2 −
2. This is obvious if we extend the ﬁeld wi, i = 1, 2, smoothly to a
3, such that
three-dimensional vector ﬁeld ¯wi, i = 1, 2, 3, deﬁned in R
¯w1 = w1 and ¯w2 = w2 on the plane z = const. Then (42b) is just
the z-component of the curl of ˆw, which transforms like a scalar under
SO(2)-rotations in this plane. It follows that the collection of integrals

transform of this scalar ﬁeld. If all of the integrals (44) were zero, the

invertibility of the Radon transform would imply that the integrand
must vanish and (42b) must hold. But this is indeed the case: Let us
take the derivative of the equation Iw = 0 with respect to x1,

∂1 Iw =

where we use the abbreviation w1,1 ≡

have

From ∂2Iw = 0 we infer a similar equation, with sin θ replaced by cos θ
in front of the integral. These equations must hold for all θ, so that the
line integrals (44) all vanish. This proves the statement.

This ﬁnishes the proof of case (A.).

5.1.2. Case B.

Our strategy here is diﬀerent, since we cannot employ standard tech-
niques from Vector Analysis.

We ﬁrst prove the equivalence (B.b)
(B.c): The implication (B.b)
(B.c) is trivial, and follows immediately by inserting (42c) into (42d).

Now we prove (B.c)

u11 = cos θ u11,1 + sin θ u11,2

In a similar way we ﬁnd

v1,12 = u11,2

u11 has compact support and therefore vanishes at inﬁnity, whilst v1

shows that we must have Iu = 0.

This ﬁnishes the proof of case (B.).

This ﬁnishes the proof of theorem 5.1.

(cid:4)

From eqs. (42b) and (42d) we learn that elements of the kernel of
the ray transform can be characterized by the identical vanishing of
a diﬀerential expression of the vector/tensor components wi, uij. The
diﬀerential operator acting in (42b) and (42d) is generically called the
Saint-Venant operator [13]. Its vanishing can be understood as an inte-
grability condition ensuring the existence of the scalar/vector ﬁelds φ
and v occuring in eqs. (42a) and (42c). We see that in the simplest case
of a vector ﬁeld w, the condition for the vanishing of the ray transform
is equivalent to the statement that w is the gradient of a potential
φ, and (42b) is nothing but the necessary and suﬃcient condition for
n
the existence of the potential. The case of a symmetric m-tensor in R
provides a nontrivial generalization of this scenario.

6. Longitudinal and transverse tensor components

The signiﬁcance of the kernel of the ray transform is further eluci-
dated by considering the standard decomposition of symmetric tensor
ﬁelds of degree m (including vector ﬁelds) into transverse T⊥i1...im and
longitudinal (dv)i1...im components,

Ti1...im = T⊥i1...im + (dv)i1...im .

(57)

The transverse part T⊥i1...im is characterized by its vanishing diver-
gence, ∂im T⊥i1...im = 0, while the longitudinal part dv is the sym-
metrized covariant derivative of the symmetric (m
1) tensor v, and
is given by

On comparing (42a, 42c) with (60a, 60b) we see that the kernel of the
ray transforms Iw, Iu consists precisely of the longitudinal components
dφ, dv of the vector/tensor ﬁeld w, u! It follows that these components
cannot be retrieved from the ray transforms of these ﬁelds. This result
is obviously of central import for any attempt to reconstruct optical
and stress tensors from photoelastic measurements.

Endowed with this knowledge we can now turn to the question
to which extent the ray transform may be inverted: To this end we
introduce the integral moments (µmIT )j1...jm(X) of the ray transform
(IT )(X, ξ) of the symmetric tensor Ti1...im(X) of degree m on R

Eqs. (64) provide the explicit answer to the question to which degree
the components of a vector ﬁeld w and a symmetric tensor ﬁeld u on
2 can be reconstructed from their ray transforms Iw and Iu: It is pre-
cisely the transverse components of these ﬁelds which can be retrieved
in full, whereas the longitudinal components, these being symmetric
covariant derivatives of lower-rank tensors, must remain undetermined.

The right-hand sides of (65) contain the ray transforms Iw and Iu of
the vector- and tensor ﬁeld, and can therefore be regarded as known
functions of the data collected from measurements. Now, from theorem
5.1 we know that the Saint-Vernant operator (42b, 42d) annihilates
precisely the longitudinal component of a vector- or symmetric tensor
ﬁeld [and therefore must be related to products of the projectors (59c)

by Fourier transformation]. Thus, if the Saint-Venant operator acts on
w and u in the manner of (42b) and (42d), only the transverse compo-
nents w⊥ and u⊥ of w and u survive. For these transverse components
we now substitute expressions (65); thus, we obtain quantities

We now regard (67) as a system of equations for the unknown σij, where
the left-hand sides W and U are known through (66); furthermore, the
equilibrium conditions (26) and the boundary conditions (27) are added
to this system. The third equation in (26) implies that

W = ∂3 σ33

.

(68)

Furthermore, diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst equation in (26) with respect to
x1, the second with respect to x2 and adding the results gives, on using
(67a),

∂3 W − U =

The value of σ33 on the lateral surface B of the cylindrical region G
is determined by the ray transform Iu: Let Iu(X, X ′) denote the ray
transform of u along a line which connects two points X = (x, y, z)
and X ′ = (x′, y′, z) at the same height z on the cylindrical specimen,
where both X and X ′ belong to the boundary B. By taking the limit
X ′
X, the integrand in Iu is nonvanishing only on an inﬁnitesimally
short interval in the neighbourhood of the point X, which becomes
tangential to B in the limit. Using the stress-free condition (27) of the
lateral surface then yields

since the value of σ33 on the boundary is given by (70), hence the
Dirichlet problem (69) can be solved uniquely for any given z
(a, b).
Alternatively, the Dirichlet problem may be solved for just one z0 ∈
(a, b) and then (68) may be integrated to obtain σ33 everywhere.
Finally, we might wonder whether there is any more information to
be retrieved from the ray transforms Iw and Iu, or alternatively W and
U, as so far we could only reconstruct one tensor component from these
data. The answer is no: As proven in [13], if any two stress tensors σ(1)
and σ(2) satisfy (26, 27) and σ(1)
33 = σ(2)
33 then they produce the same
ray transforms, Iw(1) = Iw(2) and Iu(1) = Iu(2). As a consequence, the
retrieval of one tensor component is the maximum information to be
gleaned from a ray transform which is performed for horizontal lines
only. If we wish to reconstruct other tensor components, the orientation
of the incident light beam must be changed accordingly.

7. Newton-Kantarovich method

Sharafutdinov’s theory shows that in the linearised problem of pho-
toelastic tomography the transverse part of the stress tensor can be
recovered from complete photoelastic data, and that this inversion
is stable under suitable smoothness assumptions on σ. The forward
problem represented by the solution of the ODE (21) along each ray is
non-linear in σ, its Fr´echet derivative at σ = 0 being the ray transform
(24). Unlike the linearization about non-zero stress, this transform has
an explicit Fourier inversion formula. It might therefore be possible to
extend the reconstruction method outlined above into the high-stress
regime by using the Newton-Kantarovich method with ﬁxed derivative,
which means that while the forward problem is solved successively for
each updated stress, the diﬀerence between predicted and measured
optical data is used as boundary data for the same ray transform at
each iteration. While the convergence of this method is linear compared
with the quadratic convergence when the derivative is updated, it is
expected that the eﬃcient computation of the linear step will make the
former more eﬃcient numerically. These ideas will be investigated in
upcoming papers.

8. Summary

We have described the main ideas centered around Sharafutdinov’s ray
transform which represents a generalization of the Radon transform
to tensor-ﬁeld integrands. The tensorial character of the ﬁeld to be

Hammer e.a.

reconstructed manifests in a non-trivial kernel of the ray transform,
as a consequence of which the ray transform can be inverted only
with respect to the transverse components of the tensors, while the
longitudinal components are lost. We have provided an alternative
proof to the main theorem about the kernel of the ray transform as
given in Sharafutdinov’s original work, which is simpler since the scope
of our proof is limited to those cases which are relevant for the ﬁeld
of Integrated Photoelasticity. In order to illustrate the merits of the
ray transform as a tool for tensor reconstruction, a simple example
in Photoelasticity, namely the reconstruction of the σ33 component
of the stress tensor inside a birefringent medium from its horizontal
ray transform, has been discussed. The inversion of the ray transform
for the transverse components of the stress tensor together with the
equilibrium conditions on σij and the stress-free condition of the lateral
boundary, resulted in a well-posed Dirichlet problem for the compo-
nent σ33 of the stress tensor which admits a unique solution. Finally
we suggested a non-linear inversion algorithm based on the Newton-
Kantarovich method with ﬁxed derivative which might be capable of
utilizing the ray transform in the high-stress regime.

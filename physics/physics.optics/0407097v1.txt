We derive phase-matching conditions for four-wave mixing between solitons and linear waves
in optical ﬁbres with arbitrary dispersion and demonstrate resonant excitation of new spectral
components via this process.

The use of any optical system, including ﬁbres, for fre-
quency conversion relies on the ability to satisfy so-called
phase matching conditions, which critically depend on
the dispersive properties of the system, and on strong
enough nonlinear properties, to allow reduction in the
threshold pump power. The recent surge of interest in
theoretical and experimental studies of optical paramet-
ric processes in photonic crystal ﬁbres (PCFs) [1–7] is
related to their high nonlinearities, achieved by reduc-
tion in the core size [8], and to the possibility of disper-
sion control by suitable design of the photonic crystal
cladding [2].

Here we study parametric generation of new frequen-
cies resulting from four-wave mixing (FWM) of solitons
and continuous waves (cw’s) in optical ﬁbres under condi-
tions where the eﬀects of higher order dispersion are im-
portant, i.e., when pulses are short and/or the frequency
dependence of the group velocity dispersion (GVD) is
steep.
Interest to this problem arises from the fact
that the Fourier components of a soliton are dispersion-
less, while freely propagating cw’s are strongly disper-
sive. Therefore the phase-matching conditions are ex-
pected to be satisﬁed at frequencies diﬀerent from those
generated by the mixing of cw’s. Addressing this issue
is timely because of the availability of strongly nonlin-
ear small-core PCFs [7,8], which decrease the thresh-
old for observing of parametric processes by one to two
orders of magnitude compared to conventional ﬁbres:
γconven ∼ 10−3W−1m−1, γpcf ∼ 10−2 to 10−1W−1m−1,
where γ is the nonlinear ﬁbre parameter [9]. Strongly
nonlinear PCFs have already been used to demonstrate
the coupling of solitons and cw radiation in: supercon-
tinuum generation [1,6], strong red and blue resonant, or
Cherenkov, radiation from solitons [6,7] and cancellation
of the soliton self-frequency shift by the spectral recoil [7].
Note, that it is natural to expect that FWM of solitons
and cw radiation is one of the many nonlinear processes
contributing to the shape of the supercontinuum spectra.

The problem of mixing of solitons and cw using the ide-
alized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLS), i.e., with
higher order dispersion disregarded, has been analyzed
in a number of papers in the past [10–15]. In these cases
several exact analytical solutions for a soliton sitting on
the cw background were found [14,15] and diﬀerent per-
turbation techniques suggested [10–13]. However, none
of these studies have addressed the issue of generation of

new frequencies by FWM of solitons and cw light – the
central focus of this paper.

We assume that the dynamics of the dimensionless am-
plitude A(t, z) of the fundamental ﬁber mode is governed
by the generalized NLS equation [2]

∂zA = iD(i∂t)A + iA

R(t′)|A(t − t′, z)|2dt′.

where τ is the pulse duration and ω0 is the reference fre-
quency. To avoid any ambiguity in the analytical expres-
sions we adopt the convention of using round brackets (..)
to indicate the arguments of functions or operators and
[..], {..} for all other purposes. R(t) is the response func-
tion of the material, which includes instantaneous Kerr
and delayed Raman nonlinearities:

R(t) = [1 − θ]∆(t) + θαΘ(t)e−t/τ2 sin(t/τ1)

Here ∆(t) and Θ(t) are, respectively, delta and Heavi-
side functions, α = [τ1/τ2 + τ2/τ1]/τ2, θ = 0.18, τ1 =
12.2f s/τ , τ2 = 32f s/τ [9]. t is the time in the reference
frame moving with the group velocity v0 = v(ω0) and
measured in the units of τ : t = [T − z/v0]/τ , where T
is the physical time. z = Z/Lgvd, where Z is the dis-
tance along the ﬁber and Lgvd = τ 2/|β2(ω0)| is the GVD
length. The ﬁeld amplitude A is measured in units of
γLgvd, where N 2 is the ratio of the peak power of
N/
the pump pulse to the peak power of a fundamental soli-
ton with duration τ .

The dispersive properties of the soliton and linear cw
are crucial for the following, so we now discuss them in
some detail. Looking for a linear wave solution of (1) in
the form A ∼ eiDxz−iδxt we ﬁnd Dx = D(δx). In what
follows the subscript x can take any convenient notation.
E.g., δs and δcw correspond below to the frequency shifts
of the soliton and cw-pump, respectively. Thus the physi-
cal wave number of a linear wave with frequency ω0+δx/τ
is given by kx = k(ω0) + Dx/Lgvd. Plotting kx − k(ω0) vs
δx one simply recovers the dispersion proﬁle of the ﬁbre.

i.e., the GVD at the soliton frequency is anomalous. Here
s /(2q), ′ denotes the derivative
ξ = t − D′
with respect to δ and q > 0 is the additional shift of
the soliton wave number. Representing F (ξ) through
the inverse transform of its Fourier image ˜F (δ),
i.e.
dδ ˜F eiξ[δs−δ], one ﬁnds that the wave number of a
F =
Fourier component of the soliton with frequency ω0+δx/τ
is given by ks/x = k(ω0) + {Ds + q − [δs − δx]D′
s}/Lgvd.
Thus plotting ks/x −k(ω0) vs δx will give the tangent line
to the curve kx − k(ω0) taken at the point δx = δs and
shifted up by q. The linear dependence of ks/x on δx is
a reﬂection of the dispersion-free nature of solitons.

Eq. (8) does not depend on the cw-pump and it is known
to describe the emission of non-localized dispersive waves
from solitons – so-called resonant or Cherenkov radiation
– in ﬁbres with zero GVD points [6,7,16–18]. This radi-
ation exists because the continuous part of the spectrum
of the operator ˆL has a zero eigenvalue, which ensures
resonance with the forcing term p. The operator ˆL + ˆW

is expected to have several diﬀerent resonances, a situ-
ation which to our knowledge has not previously been
considered. These resonances are driven by FWM be-
tween the soliton and the cw, see the left-hand side in
Eq. (9). To ﬁnd continuous spectra of ˆL and ˆL + ˆW we
neglect the F 2-terms and look for eigenfunctions in the
form ψp ∼ eiκz+i[δs−δ]ξ and ψ± ∼ e±iκz±i[δs−δ]ξ Assum-
ing that the wave numbers of the continuum modes are
matched with the wave numbers of the driving terms in
Eqs. (8,9), i.e. κ = 0, we ﬁnd:

Eqs. (10,11) are the equations for δ. The roots of these
equations, which can be easily found graphically, yield
the frequencies of the emitted radiation. The right-hand
side D(δ) is simply the dispersion of linear waves, which is
a nonlinear function of δ. The left-hand sides are straight
lines. Fitting the experimentally measured dispersion
characteristics of the ﬁbres usually results in a very high
order polynomial for D(δ) [2,7]. Here, however we use
the simplest illustrative example, when only the third
order dispersion is included, i.e. D(δ) = −δ2/2 + ǫδ3,
ǫ = ∂ωβ2(ω0)/(6τ |β2(ω0)|). This model accurately de-
scribes regions where the frequency dependence of β2(ω)
is quasi-linear - typical for telecom and PCF ﬁbres, see,
e.g., [7]. Figs. 1(a) and (b) show plots of the right-
and left-hand sides of Eqs. (10,11). Eq. (10) gives the
Cherenkov resonance [6,7,16–18], which does not depend
on the cw-pump. The roots resulting from Eqs. (11),
however, are determined by the cw-pump. Depending on
the value of δcw Eqs. (11) produce either two or four new
roots, see Figs. 1(a),(b). Assuming that δ = δcw, we ﬁnd
that Eq. (11) with + is satisﬁed, which means that one of
the new roots always coincides with δcw. Clearly the po-
sition of these new resonances strongly depends on, and
can be controlled by, the frequency of the cw-pump and
by engineering the linear dispersion proﬁle of the ﬁbres.
The four-wave mixing nature of the new resonances
becomes clear if we make use of the expressions for the
wave numbers of the dispersive waves and the Fourier
components of the soliton (see the discussion around Eq.
(4)). Indeed, Eqs. (11) can be rewritten in the form

±[kcw − ks/cw] + ks/rad = krad.

(12)

Here krad, kcw are wavenumbers of the resonant radiation
and the cw-pump, and ks/rad, ks/cw are the wavenumbers
of the Fourier components of the soliton at the frequen-
cies of the resonant radiation and the cw-pump.

To conﬁrm our analytical ﬁndings we have carried out
a series of numerical experiments with parameters close
to the ones in [7]. Comparing Figs. 1 (a),(b) with 1
(c),(d) one sees excellent agreement between the analyt-
ical predictions and the frequencies emerging from the

2

modelling of (1). The eﬃciency of excitation of the new
frequencies strongly depends on the choice of δs and δcw
relative to each other and to the zero GVD point. This
explains why not all the resonances are observed simulta-
neously. Changing δcw,s we have been able to observe all
of the newly predicted resonances. Theoretical analysis
of this problem is possible within the framework of Eq.
(7) and we leave it for a future study. The cw powers
required to observe the new FWM resonances are of the
order or less than 1W, see the Fig. 1 caption.

Straight/curved lines in (a,b) are the left/right-hand sides
(10,11). Choosing ω0 = 2π × 240THz and the
of Eqs.
ﬁbre parameters from [7] we ﬁnd β2 = −47ps2/km and
∂ωβ2 = −0.7ps3/km. δs = 0, w = 0.1, δcw = −15 for (a,c)
and δs = −4, w = 0.3, δcw = −40 for (b,d). Other parameters
−1 this cor-
are τ = 170fs, q = 4, N = 1.5. For γ = 0.05(Wm)
responds to the pulse peak power 225W, the cw-power 0.12W
for (c) and 1.2W for (d). The full lines in (c,d) corresponds
to θ = 0, i.e. Raman is oﬀ, and the dashed lines to θ = 0.18,
i.e. Raman is on. The propagation distance is 2.8m (c) and
16m (d). The top axes are marked in wavelength units.

We have analyzed FWM between solitons and cw-
pump in ﬁbres with higher order dispersion and pre-
dicted the generation of new frequencies, which can be
controlled by tuning the cw-pump. In addition to their
fundamental signiﬁcance, our results have important im-

plications for the generation of laser light and broad-band
supercontinua in new frequency ranges.

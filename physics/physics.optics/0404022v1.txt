On the generation and the nonlinear dynamics of X-waves of the Schroedinger
equation

Using an X-wave expansion, the nonlinear propagation of self-invariant three-dimensional optical
waves is studied. Finite energy X-wave packets are built, and their generation by normally dispersive
nonlinear media is analysed. A 3D nonlinear Schroedinger model with normal dispersion is reduced
to a 1D equation with anomalous dispersion. The 3D pulse splitting is interpreted as an higher
order breathing soliton, and the beam replenishment observed in experiments with water and Kerr
media is explained accordingly. The results are also valid for periodical media and Bose condensed
gases.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst experimental evidence of X-waves formation during nonlinear optical processes has been reported in [1].
Afterwards related results have been published in [2, 3, 4]. Theoretical analyses, discussing the existence and the
generation mechanism of this class of spatially and temporally localized waves in nonlinear media, have been reported
in [5].

X-waves can be simply described as a non-monochromatic superposition of plane-waves having the same projection of
the wavevector along a given propagation direction. The resulting pulsed beam travels undistorted without diﬀraction
and dispersion, even in the absence of a nonlinear self-action. They have been originally introduced by Lu and Greeleaf
in acoustics,[6, 7] and have been the subject of intense research in many ﬁelds, recently reviewed in [8, 9, 10].

The mentioned experimental and theoretical results stimulated further investigations concerning the role of X-
waves during nonlinear processes, as well as their description as linear optical waves, where an envelope approach is
convenient, [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and their extension to quantized ﬁelds. [22] These results are
placed in the very active ﬁeld of optical self-invariant pulsed beams (see among others [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]).

Immediately it has been recognized that X-waves may have a fundamental role in all nonlinear processes encom-
passing spatio-temporal mechanics, and not only during optical quadratic frequency mixing where they have been
originally observed. They have been also predicted in periodical media and Bose condensed gases. [30]

In a previous article I have shown that these waves, also named progressive undistorted waves, are associated to
instability mechanisms of wide beams propagating in focusing, or defocusing, Kerr media, with a refractive index
linearly dependent on intensity. [31] This eﬀect has also been investigated in quadratically nonlinear media [19, 22].
Very recently it has been proposed that light localization, observed using femtosecond pulses in water, [32] can be
eﬀectively explained by the “nonlinear X-wave paradigm”. [33] The authors pointed out that these spatio-temporal
packets can be highly dynamical, meaning that they are continuously generated, split, and replenish, with an “average”
invariant propagation. Such a picture points out the robustness of X-waves with respect to the many non-trivial
eﬀects that may appear during 3+1D nonlinear processes. Conversely self-trapped optical bullets, which do not exist
in absence of a nonlinear response, are much more sensible (“structurally unstable” in many cases) to the speciﬁc
model.

The X-waves dynamics seem to be strongly connected to the pulse splitting during self-focusing in normally
dispersive media, which has been originally predicted in 1992 [34, 35], and investigated by several authors.
[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] The experimental investigation of the splitting/replenishment has been recently reported
in [44].

In this article a preliminary settlement of nonlinear dynamics of X-waves is attempted. For deﬁniteness the theory
is developed with reference to nonlinear optics but, as outlined in [30], it applies as well to Bose Einstein condensation
(i.e. to “matter X-waves”). The guiding idea is: if these wave-packets may in some sense be considered as “modes
of free space”, characterized by a given direction of propagation Z, then the nonlinear evolution is essentially two
dimensional, involving Z and time. Thus, under certain conditions, the problem can be reformulated, and strongly
simpliﬁed, following the well known approach of guided wave nonlinear optics.
It cannot be expected that this
framework will encompass all the possible regimes, however physical intuition, as well as comparison with the observed
phenomena, will provide the criteria of validity.

Once an appropriate X-wave expansion is determined, it is not straightforward to write down the “coupled X-wave
equations”, in analogy with the coupled mode equations, for the simple reason that these spatio-temporal beams

are not normalizable. The ﬁrst step is to build ﬁnite energy solutions, and then use the resulting superposition of
X-waves to investigate nonlinear dynamics. Section I and II of the manuscript cover the early stages of this approach.
In section III nonlinear regimes are investigated via a perturbative expansion. This is legitimated by the fact that
progressive undistorted waves do exist in absence of nonlinearity. The analysis clariﬁes in which sense X-waves are
robust, and may constitute a “paradigm” for nonlinear 3D+1 dynamics. In section IV the highly nonlinear regime is
considered. This is possible while limiting to a speciﬁc X-wave. If the wave packet is spontaneously generated during
nonlinear process (e.g. starting from a bell shaped pulsed beam) the resulting picture, as for example the emerging
of breathing solutions, provides relevant insights for the interpretation of the reported numerical and experimental
results. The last sections concern some consequences: compression and chirping of X-waves, and the relation with the
integrable 1D nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The appearance of an integrable model, enforcing the use of categories
like “breathers”, and it eﬀectiveness in interpreting many experimental and numerical investigations, points out an
intriguing connection between nonlinear X-waves and solitons.

X-WAVES FOR THE 3D+1 SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

The wave equation (at carrier angular frequency ω0) describing the paraxial propagation in normally dispersive

media, at the lowest order of approximation, can be written as

where k = ω0n(ω0)/c and its derivatives provide the dispersion. In a reference system traveling at the medium group

For the sake of simplicity only radially symmetric beams, with r = √X 2 + Y 2, will be considered hereafter.

and it appears as an X in the angle-frequency plane. The two terms in (12) correspond to slash and backslash X-waves,
as shown in ﬁgure 1. Since the beams travels rigidly (in modulus), an X-shaped spectrum determines the X-shape in
the (r, t) space (roughly, the far ﬁeld, i.e. the Fourier-Bessel transform, resembles the near ﬁeld).

a formulation that will be useful below.

Such a solution has, in general, an inﬁnite energy. This is due to considering the idealized situation, never reachable
in the experiments, of a precisely deﬁned velocity (or inverse diﬀerential velocity β). Any ﬁniteness introduced by the
experimental setup, as the spatial extension of the sample, will in general fade the lineshape of the spectrum around
the X. As a consequence there will be uncertainty in β. I will show below that this can be described by a packet of
X-waves, with velocities around a given value and ﬁnite energy. Considering an X-wave with a speciﬁc velocity is thus
such idealized as considering an elementary particle with a given momentum. [47]

Before proceeding I emphasize that more general classes of X-waves can be generated by taking for example
κ2 in (3), or as discussed in [16]. However the considered case (κ = 0) is suﬃcient to represent a

X-waves. With this aim, orthogonal X waves, ﬁrst introduced in [49] for the wave equation, constitute a fruitful
approach (see also [30]). With reference to two (either slash or backslash) X-waves solutions of (2), denoted by AX

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF X-WAVE PROPAGATION IN THE NONLINEAR REGIME

to the linear model (χ = 0), the role of the nonlinearity is just to “dress” that solution, which still continues to exist.
Given that this result is valid at any order, it furnishes a general picture for the propagation of self-invariant beams
in the nonlinear regime.

For the solution at the lowest order (n2 = 0) it is possible to take either an X-wave packet AX around ¯β or a wide
pulsed beam with negligible diﬀraction (with ¯β = 1/Vg). Higher orders are obtained in the form (35): at the ﬁrst order
it is A2
X A∗X . As a result of the following analysis, the correction to AX is still a progressive undistorted wave, traveling
at the same velocity. Since this argument can be applied at any order, the consequence is that linearly-self-invariant
beams are very robust respect to nonlinearity.

Eq. (41) can interpreted in the (ω, k

to a Dirac δ centered at g = 0. This means that the propagation acts like a spatio-temporal ﬁlter, selecting speciﬁc

which gives an hyperbola, as depicted in ﬁgure 2. It is easily seen that Eq. (43) is the dispersion relation corresponding
to Eq. (3), therefore the resulting pulsed beam is a progressive undistorted wave traveling at inverse diﬀerential velocity
¯β. In the reported experimental results there is clear evidence of this spectral hyperbola, see [51].

The asymptotes, over which energy is concentrated, correspond to slash and backslash X-waves. Thus in any
nonlinear process, which can be reduced to equation (35) X-wave packets are spontaneously generated. I stress that
one of the arms always starts at ω = 0, while in the case ¯β = 0 Eq. (43) yields the exact X-shaped spectrum. The
speciﬁc features will in general depend on the spectrum of the source, as described below by an example.

The energy distribution function is given, after (22), as

In ﬁgure 3, I show an example of the application of Eq. (53). The pump beam, with ω0 such that the wavelength
is λ0 = 1µ m, is chosen with ∆ωP = 2π/∆t, with ∆t = 500f s, and ∆kP = ∆θk0 with ∆θ = 0.1rad. For the medium

In ﬁgure 3, (a) and (b), the two branches are reported for ¯β = 0.01∆βP , corresponding to a pump beam velocity
of VP = 0.499999c. In this case the energy distribution tends to that at ¯β = 0, and no pulse splitting is expected (the
two branches are almost contiguous).

In ﬁgure 3, (c) and (d), the two branches are reported for ¯β = 0.5∆βP , corresponding to a pump beam velocity

the resulting packets will become new sources for the perturbation equation, and additional splitting will appear,
consistently with the reported numerical results (see e.g. [33, 43]).

The X-wave will in general splits for suﬃciently long propagation, following the peaks of

This situation is expected in the process of second-harmonic generation, initially considered in [14], where ¯β is
the temporal walk-oﬀ between the two harmonics (details will be given elsewhere); as well as during propagation
in dispersive materials, like those described in [33], and experimentally investigated in [44]. The widening of the
spectrum can indeed provide sources that are traveling at a group velocity diﬀerent from that at ω0 (1/k′).

Note the diﬀerence in the vertical scale in ﬁgure 3, between the panels (a), (b) and (c), (d). In both cases the pump
velocity is about 1/k′, thus showing that the mismatch between the pump velocity and the linear group velocity at
ω0 drastically aﬀects the generated spectrum of X-waves.

The energy grows with ∆βP , i.e. with extension of the spatio-temporal spectrum of the pump. After Eq.(54) it is
found that, for a wide spatial spectrum (i.e. large ∆kP , corresponding to a tightly focused pump beam), the eﬃciency
is mainly determined by the on axis temporal spectrum. Conversely, for large on axis spectrum ∆ωP , the energy of
the generated X-wave grows with ∆kP .

A remarkable result can be obtained if the solution of (58) is approximated by an X-wave-packet, which, in order to
avoid unnecessary complexity, is taken centered around the group velocity of the medium, i.e. ¯β = 0. This is a typical
approach in the standard coupled modes theory; [53] in this case a “mode” is given by an X-shaped 3D wavepacket.
As discussed below, if z is suﬃciently small, it is possible to take Θ ∼= 1 in (59); in this regime I write X(α, β) =
f (α)C(β), in order to represent the nonlinear modulation, with envelope C, of an X-wave. For deﬁniteness, I will
consider f = fp, where fp(α) is the spectrum of a basis X-wave. If C is peaked around ¯β = 0, all the components
travel approximately at the same velocity and Θ ∼= 1. Multiplying by 4π2 fp(α)/k α and integrating over α, from Eq.
(58) it is found:

the following sections) taking a beam waist of
28s2/m and λ0 = 500nm, a value far beyond the propagation distances reported in the
taking n0 = 2, k′′ = 360
experiments. [2, 44] zX is typically of the order of magnitude of the smaller between Ldisp and Ldif f (in the soliton
regime, and taking
T0 as the on axis duration), since it measures the distance after which the X-wave packet starts to
spread because of its ﬁnite energy. Therefore it is expected that the approximations leading to the 1D NSL model,
Eq.(64), are valid at least in the early stages of the dynamics (a few centimeters in reported experiments). When
z increases, the nonlinear response gets reduced (because of the sliding eﬀect discussed below), and the propagation
becomes essentially the linear evolution of the generated X-waves pattern.

The depth of focus of the progressive undistorted wave is such that the on axis intensity is kept constant along
propagation, thus enhancing nonlinear eﬀect. This is very similar to the nonlinear dynamics of guided modes, where
the tightly focused light may amplify nonlinear eﬀects.

When the temporal duration of the envelope c,

T0, is smaller than the temporal duration of the modulated X-wave,
approximately given by ∆, as far as Ldisp >> LN L the nonlinearity will mainly act as a self phase modulation. When
Ldisp ∼= LN L the so called N = 1 fundamental solution (with a sech proﬁle for c, and N the number of eigenvalues
in the inverse scattering problem of (64), with σ(s)
σ(0)) is attained. However it is readily seen that Ldisp > zX
(in the previous example Ldisp ∼= 1m) hence, the X-wave dynamics dominates the dispersion. Even if a N = 1 soliton
emerges, it essentially behaves like a non-dispersing non-diﬀracting X-wave.

FIG. 4: Nonlinearity proﬁle induced by the spatial overlap of the fundamental X-wave.

FUNDAMENTAL X-WAVE/FUNDAMENTAL SOLITON

Under suitable conditions, in practice satisﬁed in the early stages of propagation, the nonlinear dynamics of an
X-wave in a Kerr medium can be described by the 1D nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a non uniform nonlinearity
proﬁle σ(s), which is determined by the spatial (self-)overlap of the progressive undistorted wave.

As I have shown before, the whole space of X-waves is spanned by the fundamental X-waves. The fundamental
X-shaped proﬁle, integrable respect to r and typically observed in numerical simulations and experiments, is given by
f0(α) = (√k/π)∆α exp(

Therefore σ(s) is a bell shaped function whose eﬀects will be considered in the next section. Observing that its

Eqs. (82) and (83) show the “dressing” mechanism associated to the nonlinearity: the latter only acts on the shape
of the envelope which, even in the absence of nonlinearity, would travel almost undistorted. This analysis can be
repeated for any X-wave, and hence nonlinear X-waves are not numerable families of solutions (like multidimensional
solitary waves), but they have the same “cardinality” of the “space” of the linear X-waves.

Conversely, in spite of this remarkable diﬀerence with solitary waves, the (approximate) validity of an integrable
model like (81) seems establishing a strong link with solitons. Clearly this analysis is far from a rigorous settlement
of this result, but may stimulate further research. In the following section I will discuss additional consequences of
(81), pointing out nontrivial nonlinear dynamics of X-waves.

NONLINEARLY CHIRPED X-WAVES AND COMPRESSION

The fundamental X-wave/fundamental soliton discussed above is of limited physical interest, since its invariant
propagation is already “embedded” in its linear counterpart. If C(β) is a very narrow function, or equivalently the

Since the earliest works on pulse splitting in normally dispersive Kerr media, it has been known that, at the initial
stage of the process, the on axis temporal spectrum exhibits a double peaked shape. [35] In ﬁgure 5 the instantaneous

is reported. For higher order basis X-waves more complicated spectral modulations are expected. It is natural to
identify the origin of the mentioned spectral splitting as a consequence of the self-phase modulation here considered.
It is also well stated that a chirped pulse may compress while propagating in anomalous dispersion. Considering
the two frequencies, corresponding to the two peaks in ﬁgure 5, they propagate according to Eq. (64) with opposite
velocities, so that in the temporal domain the pulse gets compressed. In the process of pulse splitting considered in
[35], the on-axis temporal compression is immediately succeeding the spectral splitting.

Thus considering the whole process of pulse-splitting and admitting that in the initial stage an X-wave is formed, as
described in [31], the self-phase modulation of an X-wave can be taken at the origin of the spectral splitting. Nonlinear
processes are hence well suited for the generation of chirped X-waves, like those recently considered in [57].

SPLITTING AND REPLENISHMENT IN KERR MEDIA AS AN HIGHER ORDER SOLITON

While the fundamental soliton and the chirp provide the simplest consequences of Eq.

(64), the self-trapped
behavior of the 3D beam is fundamentally due to the X-shape. More interesting dynamics can be described referring
to multi-soliton solutions (obviously in the soliton regime). The N > 1 solitons [56] are the natural approach to
explain the splitting and the replenishment eﬀect, which has been numerically investigated in [33] and experimentally
in [44]. It is also notably that breathing linear X-waves have been reported. [58, 59]

Even if the replenishment dynamics has been considered with reference to water, while including additional terms
to Eq. (56), the most relevant features are somehow taken into account by this “simple” model. Plasma formation
and higher order dispersion have a perturbative role. [33] Highly nonlinear phenomena, like the shocks considered in
[43], are expected at very high ﬂuences and here neglected.

For example, the N=2 soliton [56] provides the approximated breathing nonlinear X-wave

In ﬁgure 6, a typical spatio-temporal proﬁle obtained after Eq. (87) is reported. The periodical depletion and
replenishment of the X-shaped distribution is evident. While propagating the two-solitons, or breather, solution
pulsates, and the beam evolves while retaining most of the energy localized and exhibiting nontrivial nonlinear
dynamics of the X-wave. The generation of a breather can also be interpreted as the origin of the splitting mechanism
in the ﬁrst stage of propagation. It is also notably that higher order solitons manifest the spectral splitting that is
typically described in numerical simulations.

Before concluding it is fruitful to summarize the resulting picture of the splitting/replenishment phenomenon. At
the beginning a wide bell shaped pulsed beam evolves into an X-wave, because of the X-wave instability [31], in
essence a spatio-temporal pattern formation. Then an eﬀective anomalous dispersion is experienced by the envelope
of the ﬁnite-energy X-wave packet, and the chirp regime is entered. Spectral splitting and on axis compression
appear. Once the width of the envelope is suﬃciently reduced, the soliton regime starts, so that the increased
intensity, due to compression, provide the generation of an higher order soliton, or breathing solution. After some
spatio-temporal oscillations, many mechanisms may intervene to stop the periodical behavior, like losses (eventually

of nonlinear origin, as two-photon absorption), or simply the fact, discussed above, that at large propagation distances
the nonlinear response averaged out, because of the sliding of the components of the ﬁnite energy X-wave packet.

CONCLUSIONS

Progressive undistorted waves, a generalization to the non-monochromatic realm of self-invariant beams, are emerg-
ing as a valuable tool in many ﬁelds of applied research, from telecommunications to biophysics (supported by the
recent experiments in water). Their natural appearance during nonlinear processes, here analyzed in the optical
domain but also possible in acoustics as well as in Bose Einstein condensation, can be considered a fundamental
result. The formation of X-waves during frequency generation is as spontaneous as the use of their paradigm in the
interpretation of 3D+1 nonlinear dynamics.

In this manuscript a preliminary attempt to establish a general theoretical framework has been done. X-waves
are indeed known to have inﬁnite energy, and their superpositions have been previously used to build ﬁnite energy
solutions; for the ﬁrst time, this approach has been here extended to the nonlinear case.

The many steps characterizing a basic nonlinear process, as the pulse-splitting in normally dispersive media, can
be interpreted in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of X-waves: from the pulse compression in the initial stage to the
splitting/replenishment phenomenon.

According to standard textbooks, a soliton (or a bullet) is a non-perturbative solution of a nonlinear wave equation.
In this sense the non dispersive and non diﬀracting wave packet here studied cannot be considered a soliton, because
it exists even in the absence of a nonlinear susceptibility. However, an intriguing connection between progressive
undistorted waves and solitons seems to be at the basis of numerically analyzed, and experimentally investigated,
eﬀects. With this respect nonlinear X-waves can be considered as a sort of mythological chimera of modern nonlinear
physics.

[45] If V is the velocity of the X-wave, and Vg = 1/k′ is the group velocity at ω0 it is: V = 1/(β + k′).
[46] In this manuscript the term X-wave is deﬁned by the mathematical expressions. Diﬀerent deﬁnitions can be found in
the literature (see the cited references), however they are not directly useful in the presence of material dispersion, or of
nonlinearity, or for envelope X-waves.

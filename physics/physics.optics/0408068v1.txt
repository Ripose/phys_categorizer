Abstract
The polarization matrix (2×2) obtained from two component eigen-spinors of spherical
harmonics help us to evaluate the diﬀerential matrix N of the anisotropic optical medium.
The geometric phase is realized through helicity of photon, assuming the transmission of
polarized light through the crystal which has been twisted about the normal to its surface
over a closed path.

Optical anholonomy was discovered long before in 1950 by Pancharatnam[1] in his
strikingly original work. From classical point of view Pancharatnam obtained his phase
-Ω/2 developed by the cyclic change of polarizat ion of light over a closed path on the
Poincare sphere.Berry from quantum mechanical point of view studied the Geometric
Phase(GP) of linearly polarized light representing photon as two component spinor [2].
Twisting the anisotropic medium over a closed path, Berry also [3]studied the phase
two-form (GP) in connection with the dielectric tensor and bierfringence of the medium.
Recently Berry and Klein [4], pointed out that the passage of polarized light through
twisted stack polarizers (P ) or retarders (R) produces the geometrical and”geometrical +
dynamical phases respectively,” as cycled around the Poincare sphere on N similar arcs.
The geometric phase in the context of polarization optics have been studied from the view-
point of group theoretical aspects by Simon and Mukunda [5] and Bhandari [6]. In the
light of Berry’s work we have recently evaluated the polarization matrix M of an optical
system from ortho-normal eigenvector represented by two-component spinors of spherical
harmonics. We also obtained the nonzero geometric phase of polarized light whose plane
of polarization is rotated over a closed path by a rotator [7]. In the light of Jones [8], here
we will calculate from the polarization matrix M, the optical property of the medium at
each point, represented by diﬀerential matrix N. The optical devices through which light
passes are twisted such a way that the polarized light suﬀers variation over a closed path.
This results to calculate the Geometric Phase of a single photon through the net change
of inclination of helicity over a closed path in the relativistic framework.

This present work is based on the consideration of light passing normally through a
crystal that has been twisted about the axis parallel to the direction of transmission of
the light. By means of an optical system of polarization matrix M [8], we will study the
properties of diﬀerential matrix N which refer not to the complete element,but only to a
given inﬁnitesimal path length within the element. In fact the matrix operator M of the
complete element is represented as a line integral of a matrix N, which describe the optical
properties (dielectric and gyration tensors) of the medium. The transmission of light
through optical device [9] results the change of polarization state which mathematically
can be represented as

If the property of light with the passage through any optical element remain unaltered
then the state is the eigenvector of the optical component and in the language of matrix,
Jones had shown the condition

where di is the constant known as eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvectors εi. For

one component optical element the matrix becomes M =

This implies that the polarization matrix is the integral of diﬀerential matrix N

When originally homogeneous crystal is twisted uniformly about an axis parallel to
the direction of transmission of light, the diﬀerential matrix shows its special dependence
upon z. Jones [10] had pointed out that the N-matrices are transformed upon rotation
of the element just as the same way as the polarization matrix M as bellows

where S is the rotation matrix and k is the angular twist per unit thickness and if N0 be
the matrix corresponding to the untwisted crystal. Then the z independent diﬀerential
matrix N ′ becomes

N ′ = N0 − kS(π/2)

This matrix of the twisted element satisfy the equation relating the twisted state ǫ′ as

The representation of photon as spinor had been observed in the earlier work of Tomita
and Chaio in 1986 which further extended and supported by Berry himself. Photons
have no magnetic moment and so can not be turned with a magnetic ﬁeld. But they
have the helicity along their propagation direction which plays the important role in our
work. Here the polarized photon has been represented relativistically by two component
spinor of spherical harmonics where the eﬀect of helicity is visualized by the parameter
χ [11]. In fact we have suggested that a photon with a ﬁxed helicity can be viewed as
if a direction vector yµ is attached at the space-time point xµ in Minkowski space, so
that we can write the coordinate in the complexiﬁed space-time as zµ = xµ + iyµ. Thus
the wave functionφ(zµ) = φ(xµ) + iφ(yµ) should take into account the polar coordinates
r, θ, φ along with the angle χ which specify the rotational orientation around direction
vector yµ. Apart from the eigenvalue m and l of the respective parameter θ and φ, there
exists µ for χ which is the measure of anisotropy, and is given by the eigen value of the
operator i d
dχ having eigenvalues µ = 0, ±1/2, ±1.... .In a three-dimensional anisotropic
space, it has been constructed following Fiertz[12] and Hurtz[13] the spherical harmonics

3

for (l = 1/2, m = ±1/2 and µ = ±1/2) half orbital angular momentum. Further it
has been shown that the two component spinor and its conjugate state can be formed
from the above spherical harmonics.
In this paper we have represented relativistically
the polarized photon by two component spinor of spherical harmonics where the eﬀect
of helicity is visualized by the parameter χ. The behavior of chiral photon with a ﬁxed
helicity ±1 in the polarized light is similar to massless fermion having helicity +1/2 or
-1/2.

In the light of Jones, the following polarization matrix M with these eigen-spinor of

spherical harmonics

represented by each point on the Poincare sphere parameterized by the angle θ and χ.
Here T is the matrix formed by the orthonormal eigenvecters of spherical harmonics and
D denotes the eigenvalue matrix that reﬂects here the helicity (+1/2,-1/2) of the polarized
photon.

Our intention is to ﬁnd out the geometric phase (GP) from the known diﬀerential
matrix N. This GP is concerned with the twisting of the optical medium about an axis
along the direction of propagation of the incident light. At a particular position of z, the
N matrix is related with M as follows

(cid:18)
The above diﬀerential matrix will resembles to the matrix of the birefringent plate when

the initial position of the system is chosen as z = 0 or θ = π/2. Thus we have

where σ2 is the Pauli matrix and the other matrix is representing a compensator whose
slow axis is along the transverse x1 direction such that it introduces a phase diﬀerence χ

eigenvectors of the diﬀerential matrix N are

that represent the polarised light on the Poincare sphere parametrised by the angle θ and
χ. A polarization state is cycled over a closed loop C on the Poincare sphere. The circuit
will be accompanied by a geometric phase γ,

by twisting the medium through one complete turn along the path of the beam. The
geometric phase for the two helicities (σ.ek) = ±1 of the polarized photon would be

γ = arg < ψinitial|ψf inal >

γ±1 = ±Ω

where γ is the solid angle swept out by ek on the sphere.

Using Jones idea [14] we assume the twist of the optical element at a particular position
along the direction of the beam, so that it causes a shift of the diﬀerential matrix from
the initial value N0 to N ′ given by

N ′ = 1/2

where k is the angular twist per unit thickness. This leads the initial eigen state depart
from the ﬁnal. Using eqn (13) and the initial eigenstate as

the twisted ﬁnal state becomes

| ~D′ >=

i − cos θ(keiχ + 1/2)

The interference between the initial and the ﬁnal state originates the required geometric

phase.

< ~D0| ~D′ >= 1/4[2 + i cos θ(2k cos χ + 1)]

This shows that the required geometric phase is represented by cos χ when the parameter
is twisted over a closed path. It can be noted that this variation of angle χ is associated
with the change of direction of helicity of the photon, when the optical device is twisted
at a point along the direction of propagation of light. Our early discussions suggest that
µ as well as χ is associated with a change of angular momentum [7]. Hence, it means
that the polarization of the light can be changed with the change of angle χ which is
associated with a transfer of angular momentum between the optical system and the
incident light. This idea supports the analysis given by Tiwari [15]. In view of this, the
total phase change is obtained by the parallel transport of the angle χ (angle of inclination
of helicity) over a closed path that indicates a rotation of the plane of polarization.

Comparing with the phase factor γ = (1/2)Ω, of Berry and Pancharatnam [1,2],we have
found here that the solid angle associated with the GP is 2π. This explains again that
a complete rotation of spin-1/2 matrix is accomplished by rotating χ over a closed path
0 ≤ χ ≤ 2π corresponds to only a half turn of the photon,which is the reverse of the ﬁeld.
I like to conclude that in the light of Jones calculus, the diﬀerential matrix N which is
the optical property of the complete element (matrix M) at an point along the inﬁnitesimal
path length of the propagation has been determined in terms of the variables θ and χ
where the latter deﬁnes the inclination of helicity of the polarized photon. Our required
geometric phase is obtained as the optical device is twisted such a way at a particular
point along the direction of the propagation that the polarized light varies over a closed
path with the simultaneous rotation of helicity of the chiral photon. This is the very
source of relativistic geometric phase of the two state quantum photon.

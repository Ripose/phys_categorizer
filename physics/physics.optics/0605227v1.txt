Abstract

As a consequence of the wave nature of light, invisibility devices based
on isotropic media cannot be perfect. The principal distortions of invisibility
are due to reﬂections and time delays. Reﬂections can be made exponen-
tially small for devices that are large in comparison with the wavelength of
light. Time delays are unavoidable and will result in wave-front dislocations.
This paper considers invisibility devices based on optical conformal mapping.
The paper shows that the time delays do not depend on the directions of
incidence, although the refractive-index proﬁle of any conformal invisibility
device is necessarily asymmetric. The distortions of images are thus uniform,
which reduces the risk of detection. The paper also shows how the ideas of
invisibility devices are connected to the transmutation of force, the stereo-
graphic projection and Escheresque tilings of the plane.

1 Introduction

The bending of light in dielectric media [1] is the cause of many optical illusions.
For example, in a mirage in the desert [2], light rays from the sky are bent above the
hot sand where the air is thin and the refractive index is low. In this way the rays
minimize their optical paths according to Fermat’s Principle [1]. They are creating
images of the sky that deceive the observer as illusions of water [2]. Imagine a diﬀer-
ent situation [3, 4, 5] where a medium guides light around a hole in it such that the
rays leave the medium as if nothing were there, see Fig. 1. Any object placed inside
would be hidden from sight. The medium would create the ultimate optical illusion:
invisibility [3]. Recently, ideas for designing such invisibility devices have been dis-
cussed [4, 5]. Ideas for minuscule invisible bodies (smaller than the wavelength of
light) are older [6], but ﬁrst schemes for implementations and interesting twists and
methods have been developed recently [7, 8]. Cloaking devices require unusually
strong refractive-index proﬁles, but it is conceivable that they can be built with di-
electric metamaterials [7, 8, 9]. Such devices would operate in the microwave region
of the electromagnetic spectrum [9] and perhaps also in some frequency windows in
the visible range [10].

Figure 1: Light propagation in a conformal invisibility device. The light rays are shown in
red. The brightness of the green background indicates the refractive-index proﬁle (details
given in the Appendix). The device consists of an exterior and an interior layer with a
clear boundary. The invisible region is shown in black. Anything could be placed there.
The left ﬁgure illustrates how light is refracted at the boundary between the two layers
and guided around the invisible region where it leaves the device as if nothing were there.
In the right ﬁgure, light simply ﬂows around the interior layer.

Strictly speaking, perfect invisibility devices based on isotropic media are impos-
sible due to the wave nature of light [11, 12]. Highly anisotropic media, however,
may lead, in principle, to the construction of perfect invisibility devices [4]. Ex-
pressed in mathematical terms, the inverse scattering problem for linear waves in
isotropic media has unique solutions [11]. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of
propagation through empty space, or a uniform medium, is only consistent with the
actual propagation through a uniform medium. In theory, nothing can be hidden.
In practice, a dielectric invisibility device would perhaps create a slight haze, instead
of a perfect image. The principal distortions of invisibility are due to reﬂections and
time delays. Reﬂections can be made exponentially small for devices that are large
in comparison with the wavelength of light [5]. Time delays are unavoidable. They
will result in wave-front dislocations at boundaries that lead to image distortions.
Wave-front dislocations also pose the risk of detection by sensitive wave-front sen-
sors [13]. In this paper we calculate the time delay caused by the scheme [5] based
on optical conformal mapping. We ﬁnd that the delay is uniform for all directions,
although the refractive-index proﬁles of invisibility devices are necessarily asymmet-
ric [14]. Therefore, the distortions of images composed of various spatial Fourier
components are uniform, which reduces the risk of detection.

2 Theory

Our theory is based on geometrical optics [1] and in particular on Fermat’s Principle
[1] and on Hamilton’s analogy [1] between the propagation of light in media and the
motion of particles in classical mechanics [15]. Suppose that the refractive index
proﬁle n(r) does not vary much over scales comparable with the wavelength of light.
In this regime of geometrical optics both polarization components of light ψ for
frequencies ω obey the Helmholtz equation [1]

where c denotes the speed of light in vacuum. The Helmholtz equation (1) is equiv-
alent to the stationary Schr¨odinger equation with potential U and energy E such
that [1]

Therefore we expect that Hamilton’s equations for light rays are equivalent to New-
ton’s equations of mechanical particles1 moving in the potential (2). The frequency ω
plays the role of the Hamiltonian and the wavevector k corresponds to the canonical
momentum,

1Light rays in moving media behave like particles in magnetic ﬁelds for low velocities [16, 17, 19]

and like particles in gravitational ﬁelds [19, 18, 20] in general.

Equation (5) also reveals the connection to Fermat’s Principle [1]:
light in media
with refractive index n takes the shortest (or longest) optical path where the optical
path length is deﬁned, in Cartesian coordinates, as

To see this we use the fact that the modulus of the Hamiltonian velocity v equals

Along a ray trajectory the phase φ is constant. Consequently, the phase delay
corresponds to ωt. Therefore, the Hamiltonian time t measures the true time delay
of light caused by the refractive-index proﬁle, whereas the Newtonian time τ serves
as a convenient parameter to characterize the ray trajectories.

Another ingredient of our theory is optical conformal mapping [5]. Consider
an eﬀectively two-dimensional case where the medium is uniform in one direction
and the light propagates in a plane orthogonal to this axis. It is convenient to use
complex numbers z = x + iy for describing the Cartesian coordinates x and y in this
plane. In complex notation, the Helmholtz equation (1) assumes the form

Figure 2: Optical conformal map. A dielectric medium conformally maps physical space
described by the points z = x + iy of the complex plane onto a stack of Riemann sheets
if the refractive-index proﬁle is
with some analytic function w(z). An invisibility
device [5] consists of two layers in real space, as Fig. 1 indicates. On the Riemann surface,
the top sheet corresponds to the exterior and the ﬁrst lower sheet to the interior layer. The
ﬁgure illustrates the typical fates of light rays in such media. On the Riemann sheets rays
propagate along straight lines. The rays shown in blue and green avoid the branch cut
and hence the interior of the device. The ray shown in red crosses the cut and passes onto
corresponds to a singularity
the ﬁrst lower sheet where it approaches

absorbed, unless they are guided back to the exterior sheet.

Suppose that the complex z coordinates are transformed to new coordinates w with
an analytic function w(z) that does not depend on the complex conjugate z∗ and
hence satisﬁes the Cauchy-Riemann diﬀerential equations [21]. Such analytic func-
tions deﬁne conformal mappings of the complex plane onto Riemann surfaces [22],
see, for example, Fig. 2. Since ∂/∂z = (dw/dz) ∂/∂w and ∂/∂z∗ = (dw∗/dz∗) ∂/∂w∗
we obtain in w space the Helmholtz equation (11) with the transformed refractive-
index proﬁle n′ that is related to n as [5, 23]

On the Riemann surface, light thus propagates according to the refractive index
proﬁle n′. The strategy [5] for designing an invisibility device is to take advantage
of the sheets of the Riemann surface. Each sheet corresponds to a distinct region
in physical space, see, for example, Fig. 3. The branch cuts of the Riemann surface
represent the boundaries between the various regions. If one wishes to hide an object,
one should hide it on Riemann sheets and prevent light from entering these sheets.
To do this, light that has ventured across a branch cut into the interior of the device
should be guided back to the exterior. This is done by placing a refractive-index
proﬁle on the ﬁrst interior sheet in which all ray trajectories are closed [5]. The
device thus consists of two layers, an outer layer that corresponds to the exterior
sheet on the Riemann surface in w space and an inner layer that corresponds to
the ﬁrst interior sheet. For the outer layer we require that the refractive index

approaches unity at

(13)

At the boundary between the exterior and the ﬁrst interior sheet light is refracted
[1] according to Snell’s law2, unless it is totally reﬂected [1, 5]. Since refraction is
reversible, the light rays are refracted back to the original direction of incidence
when they leave the branch cut to the exterior sheet. Seen on the Riemann surface,
light rays perform loops around a branch point that guide them back to the exterior
sheet, the outside layer of the device. Seen in physical space, light is guided around
the object and leaves the cloaking layers of the device as if nothing were there.

Riemann sheets are tiles.

Figure 3:
In optical conformal mapping, Riemann sheets
represent regions of two-dimensional space, tiles of various forms [21, 22]. The ﬁgure
illustrates the tiling behind the light propagation of Fig. 1 (details given in the Appendix).
The upper imaginary half-plane of each sheet corresponds to a grey tile and the lower half-
plane to a white tile. The exterior and the interior sheets of the invisibility device occupy
two of such pairs of tiles and the hidden core takes the rest.

3 Time delay

The time delay caused by an invisibility device depends of course on its spatial
extension. Imagine that the refractive-index proﬁle n(r) is replaced by n(ξr) with
the constant scale ξ. If r(t) and k(t) are solutions of Hamilton’s ray equations (4)
then ξr and k are solutions, too, if t is replaced by ξt. This proves that the time
delay is directly proportional to the spatial extension of the refractive-index proﬁle,
as one would expect.

2The law of refraction was discovered by the Arabian scientist Ibn Sahl more than a millennium

ago [24].

Since the conformal mapping w(z) is simply a coordinate transformation, the
time delay between two points in z space and the delay between the corresponding
points in w space are identical. Therefore the part of the refractive-index proﬁle n
in physical space that is due to the optical conformal mapping does not inﬂuence
the time delay at all. Delays are only caused by the index proﬁle in w space that
serves to guide light around a branch cut on the ﬁrst interior sheet. For simplifying
the notation, we denote this proﬁle by n (dropping the prime).

Suppose that the transformed refractive-index proﬁle n on the Riemann sheet
is radially symmetric with respect to one branch point and designed such that all
trajectories of light rays are closed curves around that point. The time delay t0 of
the invisibility device is equal to the time light takes to perform a loop around the
branch point. A branch point where ν sheets meet requires ν turns (ν is the winding
number). To calculate the delay, we use polar coordinates r and ϕ centered at the
branch point. We obtain from the conservation law of energy [15] for the Newtonian
dynamics (6) of light rays

As in the standard theory of motion in central potentials [15] we also use the con-

laws (14) and (15) the relation [23]

To calculate the time delay, we express the Hamiltonian time increment (7) in terms
of dϕ, utilizing the conservation of the angular momentum (15). Then we use the
relation (16) to write the time delay as an integral over the radial range of the
trajectory. The range of r is bounded by the radial turning points r± where dr/dϕ
vanishes, which implies

n2(r±)r2

± = b2 .

One trajectory between r− and r+ corresponds to half a turn around the branch
point. Consequently,

In general, the time delay depends on the impact parameter. However, for closed
loops, t0 turns out to be independent of b. To see this, we diﬀerentiate the time
delay (18) with respect to the impact parameter b and obtain from Eqs. (16) and

because, when all loops around the branch point are closed, ϕ reaches π regardless
of the value of b. Consequently, the time delay does not depend on the direction at
which light has entered the branch cut to the ﬁrst interior sheet, i.e. the interior
layer of the device. The invisibility device causes a uniform time delay.

4 Examples

Reference [5] mentions two examples of refractive-index proﬁles on the interior sheet
that can be used to circumnavigate the branch point such that all loops are closed,
the harmonic-oscillator proﬁle

that is related to a Luneburg lens [23, 25] and the Kepler proﬁle [23, 25]

that is related to an Eaton lens [25]. Here r1 and r2 are constants that describe the
ranges of the refractive-index proﬁles. Seen on the Riemann surface, light cannot
penetrate the outside of circles of radii r1 and r2, respectively, because here the
refractive index would be purely imaginary. The optical conformal mapping turns
areas on the ﬁrst interior sheet inside out [21, 22]. Therefore, the exterior of these
circles corresponds to the invisible interior of the device.

The harmonic-oscillator and the Kepler potential are the only spherically sym-
metric potentials U where the trajectories for all bound-state energies E are closed
[15]. However, what matters in the propagation of light rays is the diﬀerence (2)
between U and E. Therefore it is suﬃcient when for a speciﬁc value of E the tra-
jectories for all angular-momenta b are closed. A known example where this is the
case is Maxwell’s ﬁsh eye [1, 23, 25, 26] with the refractive-index proﬁle

n3 =

n0
1 + (r/r3)2 .

The constant radius r3 characterizes the scale of the index proﬁle and n0 is a pa-
rameter that deﬁnes the refractive index at the branch point. If Maxwell’s ﬁsh eye
is employed to guide light back to the exterior Riemann sheet, the entire interior
sheet is reached by the incident light. However, when the Riemann surface contains
more sheets than the exterior and the ﬁrst interior sheet, all the remaining sheets
are hidden. Anything placed there is invisible.

The Newtonian equation of motion for rays generated by the harmonic-oscillator
proﬁle (20) describes Hooke’s law of a force proportional to the distance, whereas
the Kepler proﬁle (21) generates Newton’s inverse-square law. In both cases, the
trajectories form ellipses for all bound states, a fact that Newton found exceptionally
remarkable [27, 28]. However, Hooke’s law and Newton’s law can be transformed into
each other3 by a transmutation of force according to the Arnol’d-Kasner theorem
[29, 30, 31].

3Ironically, despite Newton and Hooke reportedly having been bitter rivals, their most celebrated

force laws are essential identical [29, 30, 31].

4.1 Hooke’s force

In the case of the harmonic-oscillator proﬁle (20) the ray trajectories are very simple
[15]: they form a set of ellipses centered at the origin (the branch point), see Fig.
4. To calculate the time spent along a given ellipse we use Cartesian coordinates x

Figure 4:
Light guiding using Hooke’s law (a Luneburg lens). The device guides light
that has entered its interior layer back to the exterior, represented here using two Riemann
sheets that correspond to the two layers, seen from above. At the branch cut, the thick
line between the two points in the ﬁgure, the branch points, light passes from the exterior
to the interior sheet. Here light is refracted according to Snell’s law, see Eq. (A8) of the
Appendix. On the lower sheet, the refractive-index proﬁle (20) guides the rays to the
exterior sheet in elliptic orbits with one branch point in the centre. Finally, the rays are
refracted back to their original directions and leave on the exterior sheet as if nothing
had happened. The circle in the ﬁgure indicates the maximal elongations of the ellipses.
This circle limits the region in the interior of the device that light does not enter. The
outside of the circle corresponds to the inside of the device. Anything beyond this circle
is invisible.

and y rotated such that they match the axes of this ellipse. We describe the ellipse
as

x = a cos ξ ,

y = b sin ξ ,

ξ = τ /r1

(23)

with the constants a and b being the axis lengths. One easily veriﬁes that the
trajectory (23) solves the Newtonian equation of motion (6). The ray trajectory
corresponds to the Newtonian energy 1/2, which implies

In agreement with our general results, the time delay caused by the harmonic-
oscillator proﬁle depends on the spatial extension r1 and is otherwise uniform.

4.2 Newton’s force

In order to calculate the time delay caused by the Kepler proﬁle (21), see Fig. 5, we
use the transmutation of force [29, 30, 31] to the harmonic-oscillator proﬁle, i.e. the
transformation of Newton’s law into Hooke’s law that is also based on conformal
mapping [22]. Consider trajectories in the complex plane, say the z plane, although

Figure 5: Light guiding using Newton’s law (an Eaton lens) similar to Fig. 4. Light is
guided in elliptic orbits with one branch point in the focal point, instead of the centre, as
in Hooke’s case.

in our case this plane is one of the Riemann sheets generated by the optical conformal
mapping in the ﬁrst place. Suppose that the trajectories are conformally mapped
by the analytic function w(z). We obtain from Eqs. (2) and (12) the relations

The trajectories are mapped onto each other by the transformation w(z). The
potentials U and U ′ are thus related to each other, generating dual forces [29].
Consider

The map w(z) corresponds to the Hooke potential (2) of the harmonic-oscillator
proﬁle (20) with energy E = 1/2 and, in turn, w(z) generates the Kepler proﬁle
(21) that corresponds to Newton’s inverse square law with the parameter

Since conformal mapping does not inﬂuence the time delay in light propagation,
the delay generated by the Kepler proﬁle (21) corresponds to that of the harmonic-
oscillator proﬁle (20), apart from one subtlety: already a half-ellipse of the harmonic-
oscillator is mapped onto a complete Kepler ellipse, because of the square map (28).
Consequently, the time delay is

in complete analogy to the result (25) for the harmonic-oscillator proﬁle. The time
delays are thus identical for identical ranges r1 and r2 of the refractive-index proﬁles.

4.3 Maxwell’s ﬁsh eye

Maxwell’s ﬁsh eye turns out to represent another classic conformal mapping [23], the
stereographic projection discovered by Ptolemy and applied in the Mercator map
projection4. Figure 6 shows how the points on the surface of a sphere (X, Y, Z) are
mapped onto a plane, say the z plane, according to the formulas [21, 31]

Figure 6: Stereographic projection, mapping the (x, y) plane onto the (X, Y, Z) surface
of a sphere. A line drawn from the North Pole of the sphere to (x, y) cuts the surface of
the sphere at (X, Y, Z). Circles on the plane are mapped into circles on the sphere and
vice versa [31].

Consequently, the light rays of the ﬁsh eye are mapped into rays on the surface of
a sphere with radius r3 and uniform refractive index n0/2. According to Fermat’s
Principle [1], the rays are geodesics, lines of extremal optical path length, see Fig.
7. On a uniform sphere, the geodesics are the great circles. Since they are closed
curves on the sphere, the light rays are closed on the plane as well, as we required.
Furthermore, the stereographic projection maps circles onto circles [31] and so the
light rays in Maxwell’s ﬁsh eye (22) form circles in the plane [1, 23, 25].

The calculation of the time delay of light circling in Maxwell’s ﬁsh eye is el-
ementary now, because t0 does not depend on conformal transformations and in
particular on the stereographic projection (32); t0 simply is the time delay of light
during ν loops on the surface of a sphere with radius r3 and refractive index n0/2,
which gives

ct0 = ν

2πr3 = νπr3n0 .

In agreement with our general results, the time delay is proportional to the length
scale of the refractive-index proﬁle and is uniform for all directions of incidence.

5 Conclusions

In isotropic media, no illusion is perfect due to the wave nature of light [11]. Con-
sequently, conformal invisibility devices [5] cannot be perfect; they cause reﬂections
and time delays. However, the reﬂectivity can be made exponentially small for
macroscopic devices and the time delay is uniform for all directions. This is impor-
tant, because images consist of light propagating in a range of directions, having a
range of spatial Fourier components. The time delay occurs when the light reaches

device is represented by a sphere of radius r3. At the boundary, the branch cut, the light

The diﬀraction of light will slightly blur the image, but the haze caused is uniform.

6 Appendix

The pictures of this paper are based on a conformal map using elliptic modular

including the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem [33]. We adopt the notation of the
Bateman Manuscript Project on Higher Transcendental Functions [32] (not Neharis

Figure 8: The Klein invariant J(z) tiles the upper half z plane with an inﬁnite sequence
of circular arches. The arches continue near the real axis in an inﬁnitely intricate structure
(not shown here). Identifying all horizontal strips of length 1 and deforming the outer arch
to a circle leads to Fig. 3 that illustrates the tiling of the optical conformal map (A3).

The constant r0 characterizes the spatial scale of the optical conformal mapping. Far
away from the device light should propagate through empty space, which implies
that w

In the exterior of the device, the map (A3) approaches the simple example considered
in Ref. [5], whereas in the interior the map (A3) represents the inﬁnitely more
complicated Riemann surface illustrated in Figs. 3 and 8. The Riemann surface
(31/18)r0 and w∞ =
contains three branch points [22, 32], w1 = (41/18)r0, w2 =
−
, apart from the exterior sheet with only w1

with winding numbers 1, 2 and

∞
and w2 [22, 32].

In order to calculate the ray trajectories, we consider the ray dynamics in w
space and then transform w to the physical trajectories in z space. We describe
both the ray trajectories w and the wavevectors k by complex numbers.
In the
exterior sheet light propagates along straight lines. Given a point w on the exterior
sheet, we numerically solve Eq. (A3) for z using the inversion z(w) of the asymptotic
map (A6) as the starting value,

and the ﬁrst interior sheet light is refracted according to Snell’s law [1, 24]. Since
the modulus of k equals n(ω/c), we obtain for a light ray incident at the angle ϕ

and n0 = 2. The parameters are designed such that the refractive index on the
Riemann structure reaches 1 at the other branch point w2 and exceeds 1 along the
branch cut. In this way, total reﬂection is excluded for the lowest possible value of
n0. To calculate z(w) on the ﬁrst interior sheet we utilize the modular symmetry of
the Klein invariant [32],

the device to calculate z and then transform it into z′ to continue the trajectory in
the interior layer.

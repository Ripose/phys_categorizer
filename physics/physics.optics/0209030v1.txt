(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The generation of induced radiation in volume resonator formed by metal threads

is considered. It is shown that using of such volume diﬀraction grating allows increas-

ing of lasing eﬃciency in terahertz range. The requirements on beam and grating

parameters are obtained.

INTRODUCTION

Generation of radiation in millimeter and far-infrared range with nonrelativistic and

low-relativistic electron beams gives rise diﬃculties. Gyrotrons and cyclotron resonance fa-

cilities are used as sources in millimeter and sub-millimeter range, but for their operation

magnetic ﬁeld about several tens of kiloGauss (ω

eH
mc γ) is necessary. Slow-wave de-
vices (TWT, BWT, orotrons)in this range require application of dense and thin (¡0.1 mm)

∼

electron beams, because only electrons passing near the slowing structure at the distance

λβγ/(4π) can interact with electromagnetic wave eﬀectively. It is diﬃcult to guide thin

≤
beams near slowing structure with desired accuracy. And electrical endurance of resonator

limits radiation power and density of acceptable electron beam. Conventional waveguide

systems are essentially restricted by the requirement for transverse dimensions of resonator,

which should not signiﬁcantly exceed radiation wavelength. Otherwise, generation eﬃciency

reduces abruptly due to excitation of plenty of modes.

The most of the above problems can be overpassed in VFEL. In VFEL the greater

part of electron beam interacts with electromagnetic wave due to volume distributed in-

teraction. Transverse dimensions of VFEL resonator could signiﬁcantly exceed radiation

wavelength D >> λ. In addition, electron beam and radiation power are distributed over

the whole volume that is beneﬁcial for electrical endurance of the system. Multi-wave Bragg

dynamical diﬀraction provides mode discrimination in VFEL.

Dispersion equations, describing instability and threshold conditions of generation

for VFEL were investigated in details in [1]-[4]. There were shown that threshold values

of current can be signiﬁcantly reduced in conditions of multi-wave Bragg diﬀraction. But

there mainly relativistic and ultrarelativistic electron beams were considered. Essential

distinctions appear at use of nonrelativistic and low-relativistic electrons. For example, in

slow-wave devices radiation conditions can not be fulﬁlled simultaneously with conditions

of Bragg diﬀraction if refraction index n < c/u. Generation in spatially-periodic structure

composed from dielectric threads was studied in [5] for low-relativistic (300 keV)electron

beam.

terahertz.

Present paper investigates instability of electron beam in volume diﬀraction struc-

tures composed from strained threads. There are frequency ranges, in which such systems

can generate, and those in which they work as ampliﬁers. It should be mentioned that gen-

eration can occur even in one-periodic diﬀraction structure. In this case Bragg conditions

are not fulﬁlled and back-wave is used for generation. Tuning of radiation frequency in such

a system can be provided either by change of radiation angle or by grating rotation or by

change of direction and value of electron beam velocity. Nonrelativistic and low-relativistic

electron beams passing through such structures can generate in wide frequency range up to

II. AMPLIFICATION AND GENERATION IN DIFFRACTION STRUCTURE

Let us consider an electron beam with velocity ~u passing through a periodic structure

composed from either dielectric or metal threads (see Figure 1.) Fields, which appear at

electron beam passing through a volume spatially-periodic medium are described by the

following set of equations [3]:

As it was mentioned above, synchronism conditions are incompatible with conditions

of dynamic diﬀraction for nonrelativistic and low-relativistic electron beams. In this case

generation can appear due to transition radiation in periodic medium and electron beam
interacts with slightly coupled component corresponding to the wave vector ~kτ = ~k + ~τ .

Use of Bragg multiwave distributed feedback increases generation eﬃciency and provides

discrimination of generated modes. If conditions of synchronism and Bragg conditions are

not fulﬁlled simultaneously, diﬀraction structures with two diﬀerent periods can be applied

be fulﬁlled even for one diﬀraction structure, because diﬀraction structure with one period

has unlimited set of reciprocal lattice vectors. Then reciprocal lattice vectors providing

synchronism and Bragg conditions are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in value.

It follows from (1) that dispersion equation for distributed feedback supplied by

two-wave diﬀraction with one low coupled wave is expressed as:

For developed dynamic diﬀraction, when k

1, either generation start current or

length of generation zone at certain current value can be reduced.

Each Bragg condition holds one of free parameters. For example, for certain ge-

ometry and electron beam velocity two conditions for 3-wave diﬀraction entirely determine

transverse components of wave vector kx and ky, and therefore generation frequency (see

(8, 13)). Hence, volume diﬀraction system provides mode discrimination due to multiwave

diﬀraction.

III.

DISCUSSION.

The above results aﬃrm that volume diﬀraction structure provides both ampliﬁcation

and generation regimes even in the absence of dynamic diﬀraction. In latter case generation

evolves with backward-wave similarly backward-wave tube. Frequency in such structure is

changed smoothly either at smooth variation of radiation angle (variation of kx and ky)

or at rotation of diﬀraction grating or electron beam (change of ~τ~u)(see (8), (13)). For

certain geometry and reciprocal lattice vector ampliﬁcation corresponds higher frequencies

then generation. Rotation of either diﬀraction grating or electron beam also changes value of

boundary frequency, which separates generation and ampliﬁcation ranges. Use of multiwave

distributed feedback owing to Bragg diﬀraction, let either to increase generation eﬃciency

or to reduce length of interaction area ((15), (14)). In this case generation is available with

both backward and following waves.

In particular, the proposed volume structure can be used for generation of sub-

millimeter radiation by accelerator LIU-3000. Parameters of this setup: electron beam

energy E = 800 keV, beam current I = 100

200 A. To generate radiation with wavelength

÷
0.3 mm in such a system volume structure composed from strained threads should has period

2 mm, and period of diﬀraction grating providing Bragg coupling is

0.16 mm.

For several years, periodical arrays of subwavelength cylin-
drical holes in thin metallic layers have take a crucial impor-
tance in the context of the results report by Ebbesen et al,
on particularly attractive optical transmission experiments.
First, it has been underlined that the zeroth order transmis-
sion pattern does not depend of the polarization of the inci-
dent ligth. In the present paper, we show that it is not true
in the case of rectangular holes, by contrast to the case of
circular holes. In this context, we suggest a new kind of po-
larizer which present the advantages brought by the original
Ebbesen devices. Assuming the recent technological interest
for these kinds of metallic gratings, such a kind of polarizer
could lead to new technological applications.

For several years, the motivation for investigating sur-
face plasmon properties takes a crucial importance in the
context of plasmonics. In addition, the consideration of
metallic gratings have been renewed in the context of the
results report by Ebbesen et al. They reported on par-
ticularly attractive optical transmission experiments on
periodical arrays of subwavelength cylindrical holes in a
thin metallic layer deposited on glass, a dielectric sub-
strate (see ﬁg.1a). Two speciﬁc characteristics of their
results are the transmission which is higher than the sim-
ple sum of individual holes contributions and the inter-
esting pattern of the zeroth order transmission versus
wavelength [1]. During the last few years, these experi-
mental results have received considerable attention and
they have implied several theoretical and experimental
works [1-11].
In this context, it has been pointed out
that surface plasmons (SPs) play a key role in the fea-
tures observed in the transmission curves [1-9,11].

In the original Ebbesen experiments, it has been un-
derlined that the zeroth order transmission pattern do
not depends of the polarization of the incident light. In
the present paper, we will show that it is not true in the
case of rectangular holes, by contrast to circular holes.
In this context, we suggest a new kind of polarizer which
present the advantages brought by the original Ebbesen
devices.

In the following, our simulations rest on a coupled
modes method (which takes into account the periodicity
of the device permittivity) associated with the use of the
scattering matrix formalism. In this way, we can calcu-
late the amplitudes of the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁeld,
for each diﬀracted order (which correspond to a vector g
of the reciprocal lattice) according to their polarization
(s or p) [11]. As a continuation of our previous works,
we turn our attention to the case of chromium ﬁlms [12].

Here, the thickness of the metallic ﬁlm is taking equal
to h = 100 nm. The ﬁlm is perforated with rectangular
holes with sides a = 350 nm and b = 700 nm respec-
tively. The short side is along to the x axis and the long
side is along to the y axis respectively. The holes shape
a square grating of parameter c = 1000 nm (ﬁg.1a). In-
cident light is normal to the interface i.e. normal to the
Oxy plane. The incident light is linearly polarized and
the orientation of the incident electric ﬁeld Einc is given
by the angle θ between Einc and the y axis (ﬁg.1a) in the
Oxy plane. As the transmitted zeroth order is normal to
the Oxy plane, its polarization is described in the Oxy
plane too. The transmitted zeroth order electric ﬁeld will
be described by the complex electric ﬁeld components Ex
and Ey along to the x and y axis respectively. The polar-
ization of the transmitted zeroth order is then described
by the modulus of the amplitudes |Ex| and |Ey| and the
dephasing δ = arg {Ey/Ex} . The amplitude of the inci-
dent light is equal to 1 V.m−1.

First, we represent in ﬁg.1b a schematic view of the
reciprocal lattice related to the square grating of para-
mater c in reduced coordinates. Each point corresponds
to a reciprocal lattice node, i.e. to one diﬀraction order
g = 2π
c (i, j). Solid lines represent a contours represen-
tation of the modulus of the Fourier transform of the
rectangular hole. For the most common diﬀraction or-
ders we give the values of the modulus of the Fourier
transform corresponding to the rectangular hole. Such
values are representative of the typical order of magni-
tude for the relatives amplitudes of the diﬀraction orders.
For instance the orders (±1, 0) are associated with a rel-
ative amplitude of 0.810 whereas it is of 0.318 for the
orders (0, ±1), i.e. 2.5 times less. Obviously, for a circu-
lar hole, the Fourier transform would be symmetric if we
substitute i by j and vice versa. Then, the relative am-
plitude of the orders (±1, 0) and (0, ±1) would be equal.
This diﬀerence which appears between circular and rect-
angular holes is crucial. Indeed, in a recent work [11] we
have specify the role of SPs in the Ebbesen experiment
through the concept of resonant Wood anomalies [13].
We have shown that the transmission pattern is described
by Fano’s proﬁles correlated with interferences between
non resonant processes and the resonant response of the
surface plasmons coupled with nonhomogeneous diﬀrac-
tion orders. Our study had shown that each maximum
of transmission (preceded by a minimum) corresponds
to one maximum of a Fano’s proﬁle (preceded by the
related minimum respectively) [14]. Moreover, whereas

1

such Fano’s proﬁle in transmission is related to a reso-
nant process, the location of its maximum (or minimum)
does not necesserely correspond to the location of the res-
onance (see ﬁg.2a) [11]. More precisely, the key process
in those device appears as following. We suppose that
the incident light is polarized along to the [1, 0] axis of
the grating. The incident light then diﬀracts against the
grating and generates nonhomogeneous resonant diﬀrac-
tion orders e.g. (1, 0) which is p polarized. Such resonant
order is coupled with a surface plasmon ((0, 1) is gener-
ates too obviously, but it is s polarized and then it is not
a resonant order, i.e. it is not coupled with surface plas-
mons). It becomes possible to excite this surface plasmon
which leads to a feedback reaction on the order (1, 0).
Then this diﬀraction order can diﬀract too and gener-
ate a contribution to the homogenous zeroth diﬀraction
order (0, 0).
In fact s polarized diﬀraction orders give
no contribution to the enhancement of the transmission,
contrary to p polarized diﬀraction orders [11]. Obviously,
the contribution of the order (1, 0) depends of the rela-
tive amplitude associated with and related to the Fourier
transform of the hole. Now, if the incident light is po-
larized along to the [0, 1] axis of the grating, the order
(0, 1) becomes the resonant p polarized order whereas
(1, 0) becomes the non-resonant s polarized order. Then
two cases occurs. If the Fourier transform is symmetric,
the substitution of the p polarized order (1, 0) by the p
polarized order (0, 1) let invariant the transmission.
If
the Fourier transform is not symmetric, then the con-
tribution to zeroth order of both p polarized orders will
be not the same according to the incident polarization.
In our case, if the incident light is polarized along to
the [1, 0] axis of the grating, the p polarized order (1, 0)
(which is associated with a relative amplitude of 0.810 of
the Fourier transform) gives an important contribution
to the zeroth order transmission.
If the incident light
is polarized along to the [0, 1] axis of the grating, the p
polarized order (0, 1) (which is associated with a relative
amplitude of 0.318 of the Fourier transform) gives a weak
contribution to the zeroth order transmission. Then the
transmission tx for light polarized along to the x axis
will be greater than the transmission ty for light polar-
ized along to the y axis. This let to some issues. As
explain above, the electric ﬁeld of the incident light can
be write into the form

Einc = Einc

sin θ
cos θ (cid:21)

(cid:20)

Assumming the fact that both components of the inci-
dent electric ﬁeld are not transmitted in the same way,
one write the zeroth order transmitted ﬁeld as

E =

Ex = txEinc sin θ
Ey = tyEinc cos θ (cid:21)

(cid:20)

where tx and ty respectively are the transmission coef-
ﬁcients along to the x and y axis respectively. Then it
is easy to show that the modulus of the amplitudes are
then

|Ex| = |txEinc| sin θ

One shows that eq.5 is similar to the well know Malus
Law for polarizer. To illustrate our assumptions, ﬁg.2a
shows the zeroth order transmission against wavelength
for diﬀerent θ values. We clearly show the dependance
of the transmission pattern with the incident polariza-
tion. For θ = 90o, i.e. the incident electric ﬁeld is along
to the x axis, the transmission is maximal and identi-
cal to what one observes in the Ebbesen experiments. It
is shown that the transmission increases with the wave-
length, and that it is characterized by sudden changes
in the transmission marked 1 to 2 on the ﬁgure. These
values are shifted toward larger wavelengths when the
grating size increases [11]. Moreover, for θ = 0o, i.e. the
incident electric ﬁeld is along to the y axis, the trans-
mission is minimal. This result is, at least qualitatively,
in agreement with our hypothesis. Quantitatively, ﬁg.2b
shows the variation of the transmission against the angle
of polarization θ for both wavelength 1300 nm and 1900
nm. The numerical computations give results indicated
by the dots on the ﬁgure. Using the numerical values
of the transmission for θ = 90o and θ = 0o respectively,
i.e. T90o and T0o respectively, one plots the transmis-
sion against θ for both wavelength by using eq.5 (solid
lines). One observes then a complete quantitative agree-
ment between the pattern from eq.5 and the results ob-
tained numerically. In order to detail our approach more,
were present on ﬁg.3a the amplitudes |Ex| and |Ey| of the
zeroth transmitted order against wavelength for two dif-
ferent values of θ. One shows that the |Ey| amplitude do
not exhibit high convex region in transmission contrary
to the |Ex| amplitude. As explained, the convex region in
the zeroth order transmission (i.e. the high transmission
domains between minima 1 and 2, and just after mini-
mum 2) are induced by the scattering of non-homogenous
resonant diﬀraction orders such as (±1, 0) or (0, ±1). For
the |Ex| amplitude the orders (±1, 0) are associated with
a relative amplitude of 0.810 of the Fourier transform of
the hole proﬁle. This large contribution of those orders
enables an enhanced transmission via multi-scattering.

This eﬀect appears as the reason of the existence of the
convex region of high transmission as shown in previous
works [11]. In return, for the |Ey| amplitude the reso-
nant orders (0, ±1) are associated with a relative ampli-
tude of 0.318 of the Fourier transform of the hole proﬁle.
This contribution is not enough to obtain a signiﬁcant
enhanced transmission. For θ = 30o, the |Ey| amplitude
contribution to the whole transmission is greater to the
|Ex| contribution. Although the transmission along to
the x axis is greater than along to the y axis, the x axis
component of the incident electric ﬁeld is enough weak
(by opposite to the other one along to the y axis on ac-
count of the projection) to lead |Ex| to be lower than
|Ey| . In the opposite for θ = 60o, the |Ex| amplitude
contribution to the whole transmission is greater to the
Indeed, obvioulsy, the transmission
|Ey| contribution.
along to the x axis is greater than along to the y axis,
but on the other hand, the x axis component of the in-
cident electric ﬁeld is greater to the other one along to
the y axis on account of the projection now. Then, the
amplitude |E| pattern for θ = 60o will be essentially de-
ﬁned by the pattern of the amplitude |Ex| whereas the
amplitude |E| pattern for θ = 30o will be essentially de-
ﬁned by the pattern of the amplitude |Ey|. In addition,
the whole zeroth order transmission would be greater for
θ = 60o than for θ = 30o. Again, these results are in qual-
itative agreement with our assumptions. Quantitatively,
ﬁg.3b shows the variation of the amplitudes |Ex| and |Ey|
against the angle of polarization θ for both wavelength
1300 nm and 1900 nm. The numerical computations give
results indicated by the dots on the ﬁgure. Using the nu-
merical values of the amplitudes for θ = 90o and θ = 0o,
one plot the transmission against θ for both wavelength
by using eq. 3 (solid lines). One observes then, a com-
plete quantitative agreement between the pattern from
eq.3 and the results obtained numerically as previously.
In the possibility of later experimental results, we wish
to add some details for comparison. Fig.4a gives the de-
phasing δ against wavelength for both angle θ = 60o and
θ = 30o. One shows the peaks close too the minima of
transmission, i.e. close to the surface plasmon resonance
according to our previous work [11]. Despite the absence
of an explicit dependence against θ for δ according to eq.
6, one note that a such dependence exist after all. So,
ﬁg. 4b shows the dephasing against θ for both wavelength
1300 nm and 1900 nm. The dependence of δ against θ
and wavelength is not well understood and we hope to
clarify this point in a later work. Moreover, it will be nec-
essary to search for the eﬀects induced by the parameters
change.

To conclude, we have shown that contrary to the orig-
inal Ebbesen experiments (which used a grating made
of circular holes), the zeroth order transmission pattern
depends on the polarization of the incident light when
using rectangular holes. The results presently obtained
match up with our previous works. In this context, we
obtain a device with properties globally similar to those
of the original Ebbesen experiments, but which exibits

in addition, some properties of a polarizer. Assuming
the recent technological interest for this kind of metallic
gratings, we think that the kind of device introduced in
the present paper could lead to new technological appli-
cations.

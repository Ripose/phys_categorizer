Abstract

We study the conditions for soliton-like wave propagation in the Photore-

fractive (PR) and electro-optic (i.e., Pockels) material, by using Nonlinear

Schrodinger (NLS) equation. The complete NLS equation is solved analyt-

ically and numerically by transforming it into the phase space. Our results

clearly show the existence of both the dark and bright solitary solutions for the

PR medium. Interestingly, however, we ﬁnd only one bright solitary solution

in the Pockels case and there is no evidence of any dark solitary solution.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a uniform Kerr-like nonlinear medium, the transverse proﬁle of an optical beam prop-

agates unchanged since the diﬀraction is balanced by self-focusing. Such self-focused waves

are called solitons, and are described by the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation in space-

time dimension [1] - [4] . Zakharov and Shabat have solved such NLS equation for the Kerr

medium by using Inverse Scattering Transformation (IST) [2]. Self-focused optical beams

in other non-Kerr, nonlinear media have also been investigated for the possibility of gen-

erating soliton like motion. For example, in the case of an optical beam propagation in a

Photorefractive (PR) material, charge carriers are photo-excited and redistributed around

the beam. This charge distribution produces a space charge ﬁeld, which in turn modulates

the refractive index(the electro-optic eﬀect) [5], [6]. When such a system exhibits optical

nonlinearity, the related modiﬁcations in the refractive index induces either a self-focusing

or self-defocusing of the incident beam. With an appropriate choice of the experimental

parameters, the input beam proﬁle can be made to converge asymptotically to a soliton

state whose PR nonlinearity compensates for the diﬀraction, and the beam proﬁle remains

unchanged as it propagates. Montemezzani and Gunter have investigated the proﬁle of the

one-dimensional bright spatial solitons by using a power series expansion [7]. They managed

to calculate the ﬁrst four terms of the series that describe the proﬁle of the bright solitons.

However, a complete temporal and spatial solution is yet to emerge.

In this work, we ﬁrst attempt to solve the complete NLS equation for the Pockels medium.

It is extremely diﬃcult to solve this equation with IST, so we invoke the technique of

transforming the NLS equation into phase space and determine its exact solution. We then

extend the technique to solve the NLS equation for the PR medium. In fact, we ﬁnd that

the technique of phase space transformation is so general that it enables us to solve the

NLS equation for any polynomial potential that appear in most optics and plasma physics

problems.

II. SOLITARY WAVE IN DISPERSIVE POCKELS MEDIA

Let us consider the spatial and temporal variation of the electric ﬁeld ˜E(z, t) of an optical

pulse propagating through a linear electro-optic medium as [8]:

˜E(z, t) = ˜A(z, t)exp i(k0z

ω0t) + c.c.

−

Here z and t are the space and time coordinates and k0 and ω0 are the linear components

of the wavevector and frequency of the electric ﬁeld. The total wavevector k can be written

as [8]:

tor as:

k = k0 + ∆KN L + (ω

the nonlinear contribution to the propagation constant is:

where γ is Pockels constant. Deﬁning the retarded time τ as τ = t

z/vg, the NLS equation

can be written as [8], [9]:

∆KN L = γ

Using Eqn.(3), the NLS equation for the propagating pulses in a Pockels medium is:

ered by setting γ = 0 in Eqn.(6),

Eqn.(7) can be solved using the Fourier method [8], which results in the familiar result

that the long wavelength components of an optical pulse propagate faster than the short

wavelength components when the GVD parameter, β2, is positive, and vice versa.

Another interesting phenomenon that occurs in the nonlinear media is self-phase modu-

lation eﬀect (SPM) , which can be determined in the absence of dispersion (β2 = 0). When

the SPM parameter γ is negative, the short wavelength components of an optical pulse prop-

agate faster than the long wavelength components, and vice versa [8], [9]. So when β2 > 0

and γ < 0 or β2 < 0 and γ > 0, the SPM eﬀect is canceled by GVD eﬀect, and optical

pulse can propagate in a medium with an unchanged shape. Let us consider a solution to

the Eqn.(6) as follows,

where Γ is deﬁned as the wave propagation constant. Deﬁning new variables as:

A(z, τ ) = F (τ )exp (iΓz),

Let us consider this equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation of a Hamiltonian system.

Multiplying Eqn.(12) by Q′ and integrating with respect to time, the corresponding Hamil-

tonian function can be derived as the following form:

H(Q, Q′) = Q′

where h is the constant of integration and can be determined from the initial conditions.

The Hamiltonian in Eqn.(13) represents a dynamical system and its behavior is investigated

by considering the quantities λ, µ and h as parameters.

When the parameters λ < 0 and µ > 0, Eqn.(13) can be expressed as:

We can ﬁnd the extreme limits (extrema points) of the Hamiltonian [10] by setting

We plot H(Q, Q′) for diﬀerent values of h in Fig.(3). We have hyperbolic solution for h = 1

The proﬁle of the solution is given in Fig.(4). Since this amplitude assumes negative

values, it is a unphysical solution and as such no dark solitons are possible. The case of

(λ < 0 and µ < 0) or (λ > 0 and µ < 0) also lead to non-physical solution.

III. SOLITARY WAVE IN PR MEDIA

The nonlinear contribution to the propagation in PR media can be written as (see ap-

where γ is the electronic coupling parameter, Ip is the intensity of the pump beam and

Is(z, t) is the spatial and temporal variation of the signal beam. When this form of the

nonlinear contribution is substituted into the NLS Eqn.(4), we obtain:

where β2 is a measure of the dispersion of the group velocity.

To achieve the separation of variables z and τ , we seek a solution of the form:

−

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

where Γ is deﬁned as the pulse propagation constant and F (τ ) is a real function of τ . With

Similar to last section, we multiply Eqn. (27) by Q′ and integrate, we obtain the corre-

sponding Hamiltonian function:

H(Q, Q′) = Q′

2 + sgn(λ)Q2 + sgn(µ) ln(a2 + Q2) = h,

(28)

where h is a constant of integration.

We look in the phase space for solitary solutions of the above equation. Using Eqn.(15)

we ﬁnd as before the extrema points of the Hamiltonian to be:

h = sgn(λ)[

sgn(µ)
sgn(λ) −

h = sgn(µ) ln(a2)





−

If sgn(λ) = sgn(µ) then only the second value of h is valid.

First we consider the case of µ < 0, λ > 0, where the two values of h are h = 1

h =

ln(a2). It can be easily seen that there is no solitary solution for the ﬁrst value of h.

−

For the second value of h Eqn. (28) can be expressed as:

H(Q, Q′) = Q′

ln(a2 + Q2) =

(31)

Integrating this equation, we ﬁnd the proﬁle of the solution as plotted in Fig.(6).

For the case µ > 0, λ < 0, the solitary wave solution is located at h = a2

1 and substituting

−

h in the Hamiltonian of Eqn.(28), we can derive a dark solitary solution. The phase space

orbits are given in Fig.(7) and the proﬁle of the dark solution is given in Fig.(8).

For all other cases (µ < 0, λ < 0 and µ > 0, λ > 0), there are no solitary solutions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We started from the NLS equation and solved it for a time-dependent potential in a

medium with Pockels eﬀect. Our analytical solutions show that there is only one possible

case where the soliton-like wave can propagate in the Pockels material.

In the second part, we solved the NLS equation for PR medium to ﬁnd the conditions

under which the soliton-like waves can propagate. The conditions we found are: a) µ <

0, λ > 0 that leads to the bright solitary waves and b)µ > 0, λ < 0, which leads to the dark

solitary waves.

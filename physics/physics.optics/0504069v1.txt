Abstract— We demonstrate a ﬁber Fabry-Perot (FFP) sensor
capable of detecting sub-picostrain signals, from 100 Hz and
extending beyond 100 kHz, using the Pound-Drever-Hall fre-
quency locking technique. A low power diode laser at 1550 nm is
locked to a free-space reference cavity to suppress its free-running
frequency noise, thereby stabilizing the laser. The stabilized laser
is then used to interrogate a FFP where the PDH error signal
yields the instantaneous ﬁber strain.

Index Terms— ﬁber sensor, modulation, interferometry, strain

sensing, ﬁber resonator.

F IBER Bragg gratings play an emerging role in the realiza-

tion of ultra-sensitive static and dynamic strain detectors
for a variety of applications, such as underwater acoustic
array sensors [1], embedded monitoring of smart structures in
civil and aerospace industries [2]–[4], ultrasonic hydrophones
for medical sensing [5], and seismic sensors for geophysical
surveys [6]. The beneﬁts over the piezo-electric strain sensors
currently employed include their smaller cross-sectional area
and their scalability to large arrays. In addition, the detector ar-
rays could be remotely interrogated and optically multiplexed
using standard telecommunications equipment.

The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) frequency locking technique
uses RF phase modulation of a laser beam incident on a Fabry-
Perot interferometer. By detecting and demodulating the beam
reﬂected off the Fabry-Perot cavity, a high signal-to-noise error
signal is derived, yielding the instantaneous frequency differ-
ence between the laser frequency and the cavity resonance
[7], [8]. This scheme has found many applications in areas
involving laser stabilization and signal extraction [9], [10]. The
most demanding application of the PDH technique is in the
detection schemes for gravitational waves, which require strain
sensitivities approaching ∆L/L = 10−22 ε/√Hz [11], where
ε is a dimensionless unit of strain.

In this paper, the PDH technique is applied to a simple
ﬁber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FFP) formed by a Bragg
grating pair. We present a ﬁber sensing system with, to our
knowledge, an unprecedented strain sensitivity of better than
10−12 ε/√Hz, in a band extending down to 100 Hz.

The power of the PDH technique lies in its shot noise
limited closed-loop spectral density of frequency noise, which
is given by [9]

Realistic PDH experiments are usually limited to sensitivi-
ties far worse than those predicted by Eqns. 1 and 2, due to
the free running frequency noise of the interrogating laser. In
our experiment, therefore, we frequency stabilized our diode
laser to a free-space reference cavity, in order to suppress
this dominant noise source by more than three orders of
magnitude. In addition, our reference cavity has one mirror
bonded to a PZT actuator, allowing us to tune and lock the
stabilized laser to the FFP resonance. The PDH error signal
from the FFP then yields a low noise, instantaneous ﬁber strain
measurement. This two-loop control scheme is illustrated in
Fig. 1. The beamsplitter after the phase modulator tapped off
the laser beam for pre-stabilization, while the main beam was
transmitted to interrogate the FFP.

The FFP was mounted on a stage which could be re-
motely driven to stretch-tune the FFP into resonance with
the interrogating laser. In addition, one end of the FFP was
attached to a PZT, allowing the length to be modulated for a

20 mm, with nominal peak reﬂectivity of 94%. The section
of ﬁber between the Bragg mirrors was unexposed to UV.
The Bragg reﬂectors both had a bandwidth of approximately
40 GHz (320 pm) such that 9 modes could be supported,
each with a different ﬁnesse due to the change in reﬂectivity
towards the Bragg band edges. In this experiment, we used
the center high ﬁnesse mode as shown in Fig. 3b, with a
FWHM of about 100 MHz, to provide the greatest strain
responsivity. Its corresponding error signal, derived via PDH
demodulation, is shown in Fig. 3c. The error signal slope
across the resonance was measured to be 20 nV/Hz. The FFP
was close to impedance matched, such that at line center less
than 5% of the incident light was reﬂected. The laser power
incident on the FFP was typically 1 mW.

direct calibration of the strain sensitivity. The FFP and mount
were enclosed in a hermetically sealed, mechanically isolated
anechoic chamber to minimize acoustic noise in the FFP.

An external cavity diode laser (New Focus Vortex Model
TLB-6029) operating at 1550 nm was locked, via the PDH
technique, to a free-space confocal Fabry-Perot reference cav-
ity with a free-spectral-range (FSR) of 3 GHz. The cavity was
composed of an INVAR spacer with a bonded PZT actuator
to displace one of the end-mirrors, allowing dynamic tuning
of the reference cavity. The phase modulation for the PDH
control loop was applied using a resonant phase modulator
(New focus Model 4003) operating at 15 MHz. The Fabry-
Perot reference cavity had a FWHM of 35 MHz, yielding an
error signal slope of 0.11 µV/Hz. The optical power at the
laser output was 5 mW and was split between the reference
cavity and the FFP. The diode laser had two frequency
actuators: an internal PZT tuning element with a bandwidth
of approximately 3.5 kHz, as well as current feedback with a
1 MHz bandwidth.

Our laser pre-stabilization servo was designed to have a
tailored controller response with a cross-over from PZT to
current feedback at 1 kHz, with unity gain at approximately
100 kHz. This delivered an in-loop laser frequency noise
suppression of more than 1000 at 100 Hz, and rolling off to
a factor of approximately 10 at 10 kHz. The laser frequency
noise suppression plots are shown in Fig. 2, where the free-
running (upper trace) is overlaid with the stabilized laser noise
(lower trace). The spectral features at around 2, 5, 9 and 15
kHz were due to mechanical resonances of the laser tuning
PZT, while the features at 50 Hz and associated harmonics,
especially the third and ﬁfth harmonics at 150 Hz and 250 Hz
respectively, were caused by direct electrical mains pickup. In
addition there were also features caused by acoustic excitation
and mechanical pickup of the free-space reference cavity.

a) The reﬂection spectrum for the FFP showing 9 supported modes,
obtained by scanning the laser frequency using its PZT actuator. The apparent
change in FSR is due to PZT nonlinarity. b) Reﬂection power for the central
high ﬁnesse FFP mode. c) its corresponding PDH error signal.

To measure the ﬁber strain sensitivity, the FFP was stretch-
tuned such that the central high ﬁnesse mode was nearly
resonant with the stabilized laser. The laser was then locked
to this FFP resonance by feeding back the FFP error signal to
the free-space reference cavity, with a unity gain bandwidth
of approximately 20 Hz.

To calibrate the strain of this sensor, a signal of 70 mVrms
at 216 Hz was applied to the PZT attached to one end of
the FFP, which gave rise to a large peak at 216 Hz, as seen
in Fig. 4a. Knowing that the PZT had a responsivity of 4.8
nm/V at frequencies below the 600 Hz mechanical resonance,
the modulation corresponds to a displacement of 0.34 nm.
Taking into consideration the 104 mm length of ﬁber between
the supporting chucks, this displacement equates to an applied
10−9 ε. After taking the measurement bandwidth
strain of 3.3
of 4 Hz into account, the equivalent strain spectral density was
10−9 ε/√Hz. This signal was then used to calibrate
1.65
the vertical axes of Fig. 4.

From Fig. 4a, we see that the signal at 216 Hz was a factor
103 above the noise ﬂoor, yielding a strain sensitivity

10−15 ε/√Hz around 216 Hz.

kHz, ﬁber chuck resonance at 600 Hz, ﬁber violin vibrational
modes, as well as electrical pick-up due to the 50 Hz AC line.
The large wall in the spectrum below 100 Hz was likely due to
pick-up of low frequency laboratory rumble, in the reference
cavity used to stabilize the diode laser. Although the cavity was
isolated from high frequency noise with a damping enclosure,
it was still physically attached to the optical table and was
thus susceptible to its mechanical and seismic pollution. We
note that this spectral feature was absent in Fig. 2, and thus
not observed in the in-loop error signal of the laser itself.
The ﬂat noise ﬂoor underlying Fig. 4b was present even with
the laser turned off. Detailed investigations showed that this
limiting noise source was due to electronic noise of the mixer
pre-ampliﬁer stage.

The stabilized frequency noise of the laser, seen in Fig. 2
10−15
trace (b), produced an equivalent noise ﬂoor below 300
ε/√Hz, and is therefore not visible in Fig. 4, apart from the
laser PZT resonances at 2 kHz and 5 kHz.

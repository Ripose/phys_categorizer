Using a 3D fully-vectorial nonlinear time-domain analysis we numerically investigate the gen-
eration of terahertz radiation by pumping a photonic crystal microcavity out of resonance. High
quality factors and a quadratic susceptibility lead to few-cycle terahertz pulses via optical rectiﬁca-
tion. Material dispersion as well as linear and nonlinear anisotropy is fully accounted for.

In the last decades the increasing need of terahertz
(THz) sources for biomedical applications and for spec-
troscopy has dragged the researchers’ attention toward
new methods to generate radiation in this wavelength
region.
[1] Several ideas have been implemented, from
semiconductor-based fotoconductive antennas to optical
rectiﬁcation in crystals. [2, 3, 4, 5] Resonant structures
have been proposed in order to improve THz genera-
tion eﬃciency; [6] in this context Photonic Crystals (PC)
oﬀer various degrees of freedom for device design and
optimization, both in terms of dispersive features and
nanoscale integration. [7, 8, 9] PC consist of a high index-
contrast periodic distribution in either one, two or three
spatial dimensions: they severely aﬀect light propagation
when its wavelength is comparable to their characteristic
period and, since electromagnetic radiation can be con-
ﬁned in extremely small volumes for long times, PC lend
themselves to a new class of microcavities with engineer-
able Quality Factors (Q) as high as 106. [10, 11] Several
authors have recently recognized the advantages encom-
passed by the use of both linear and nonlinear resonant
structures and PC in the THz region.
[12, 13, 14, 15]
In this Letter we numerically show that light modula-
tion at terahertz frequencies can be achieved by resorting
to a high-Q PC microcavity fed by an out-of-resonance
pump. Exciting a long-lived PC cavity-mode with a sin-
gle source slightly detuned from resonance, taking ad-
vantage of transient oscillations in a quadratic medium
we obtain THz radiation via optical rectiﬁcation. The
dynamics behavior depends on both detuning and Q.
In order to simulate the generation process we developed
a three dimensional parallel Finite Diﬀerence Time Do-
main (FDTD) code, able to account for second-order non-
linearities as well as material anisotropy and dispersion.
To this extent Maxwell equations are coupled to an os-

The last equation of (1) assigns the material proper-
ties: P is the polarization due to a single-pole Lorentz-
dispersion centered in ω0, and the other parameters yield
a refractive index n ≃ 3.5 at λ = 1.55µm, with static
permittivity ǫs = 11.7045, loss coeﬃcient γ0 = 3.8e8,
ωR = 1.1406e16 and ˆωR = 1.0995e16 in MKS units. The
tensor D provides the quadratic nonlinear response, and
includes a π/4 rotation of the crystallographic axes (with
respect to the spatial coordinates) in order to generate a
second-order polarization from a linearly polarized input.
All linear and nonlinear properties, including dispersion,
match those of AlGaAs. [16] . The microcavity consists
of a void in a six-hole PC-wire (w = 450 nm, h = 270
nm and l = 4µm, see Fig. 1 inset) designed to yield
single-mode TE-like propagation in both input and out-
put waveguides.
[17] For a = 450 nm and d = 0.35a,
a resonant state appears near the middle band-gap at
λ0 = 1.447µm, with Q=373. Fig.1 graphs the oscillation
spectrum, obtained by exciting the device with a single-
cycle (broad-band) pulse and Fourier-transforming the
ﬁeld as probed inside the structure. The arrow indicates
the oﬀ-resonance input wavelength.
To reveal the transient due to microcavity excitation, we
launched (in the input waveguide) an “mnm” pulse, [18]
which ensures precise control of both leading and trailing
edges of the pulse and its bandwidth, i.e. avoids spurious
spectral artifacts.
To theoretically assess the numerical results, we also em-
ployed coupled mode theory in the time domain for the
case of a pumped cavity with feeding waveguide. [19] The
decay rate 1/τ = 2/(ω0Q) = 1/τo + 2/τe includes both
internal losses (1/τo) and those (1/τe) due to the external
load, i.e.
input and output waveguides. For a step-like
excitation s(t) = 0 for t < 0 and s(t) = s exp[jωt] for
t > 0, the time evolution of the cavity mode a(t) is given
by (the input power is Pinput = |s|2):

a(t) =

j(ω − ω0) + 1/τ

[ejωt − e(jω0−1/τ )t].

To demonstrate how this scheme works for a pulsed ex-

inside the cavity. The arrow indicates the out-of-resonance
input wavelength. The inset is a sketch of the device geome-
try.

Fig. 2 displays the time evolution of the y-component
of the electric ﬁeld inside the cavity for two diﬀerent
wavelengths. The top panel corresponds to an excita-
tion at ∆λ = λinput − λ0 = 15nm, the bottom one at
∆λ = 20nm. As expected from Eq. (2) the larger the
shift from resonance, the higher the frequency of the os-
cillating transient. THz waves result from optical rec-
tiﬁcation of such transient inside the cavity, due to the
locally pronounced radiation intensity. Such generation
can be written in term of the quadratically nonlinear po-
larization P j = χjklEkE∗
l (using contracted notation),
with χjkl the pertinent component of the susceptibility
tensor, mixing intra-cavity ﬁelds Ek and El, correspond-
ing to the spatial components fk(r) and fl(r)of the defect
mode, respectively. Naming δ = ω0 − ω the frequency
generated via the interaction, the resulting amplitude of
the THz nonlinear polarization is:

The temporal dynamics is governed by the cavity
decay-time, and provides few-cycle pulses at THz. Since
the latter wavelengths are in the millimeter range, the ra-
diation is unconﬁned and barely “senses” the structure.
If required, however, it could be trapped e.g. by a hol-
low pipe waveguide.
[20] Fig. 3 displays the generated
THz power evaluated by FDTD from the power density
spectra (PDS) and at two detuning δ. The curves clearly
exhibit a quadratic dependence from the input power at
ω, the lines being quadratic ﬁts.
While the ﬁnal conversion eﬃciency depends on the
(eventually) adopted THz guiding geometry, the case
λ = 1.462µm (corresponding to δ = 2.1T Hz) is clearly
more eﬃcient than for λ = 1.467µm (δ = 2.8T Hz), as

with two “mnm” pulses (m = 6, n = 600), mimicking
a Return-to-Zero modulation of the optical pump. The
top panel of Fig. 4 shows the y component of the electric
ﬁeld inside the cavity when pumped at λ = 1.462µm.
To extract the THz portion of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
we performed the spectrogram of the TM component, al-
lowing it to follow the time evolution of the signal at the
desired frequency. The bottom panel of Fig. 4 plots the
THz pulses obtained through this procedure.
Finally, to quantify the generation eﬃciency η, we eval-
uated the intensity of both optical and THz signals, in-
tegrating the PDS of TE and TM components around
ω0 and δ, respectively. This yielded a promising η =
2.3 × 10−7 for δ = 2.1T Hz and η = 1.3 × 10−7 for
δ = 2.8T Hz, respectively. Note that, in this unopti-
mized 3-hole PC wire, Q = 373 is far below the values
recently obtained in PC cavities, as high as Q = 1 × 106.
[10, 11]

The best performance can be achieved when τe max-
imizes the last factor in Eq. (3), hence THz generation
becomes linearly dependent on Qo and the ﬁnal eﬃciency
grows quadratically to values competitive with those re-
cently achieved. [5]
In conclusion, we numerically investigated THz sources
based on optical rectiﬁcation of the transient response of
a PC-wire microcavity. This optically pumped device,
amenable to be incorporated in THz circuitry, can be
tailored to speciﬁc requirements in terms of frequency
oscillation and eﬃciency.

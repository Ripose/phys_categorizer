We analyze theoretically and experimentally the inﬂuence of current noise on the longitudinal
mode hopping dynamics of a bulk semiconductor laser. It is shown that the mean residence times
on each mode have diﬀerent sensitivity to external noise added to the bias current. In particular,
an increase of the noise level enhances the residence time on the longitudinal mode that dominates
at low current, evidencing the multiplicative nature of the stochastic process. A two-mode rate
equation model for semiconductor laser is able to reproduce the experimental ﬁndings. Under a
suitable separation of the involved time scales, the model can be reduced to a 1D bistable potential
system with a multiplicative stochastic term related to the current noise strength. The reduced
model clariﬁes the inﬂuence of the diﬀerent noise sources on the hopping dynamics.

INTRODUCTION

Fluctuations and noise are inherent to the behavior
of any physical system. Their ubiquity and impact on
technological applications have stimulated since long ago
the study of their eﬀects in diﬀerent branches of science
(statistical physics, mathematics) and technology (com-
munications engineering).

Noise is usually perceived as a source of degradation of
the properties of any system, leading to relatively small
stochastic variations of a given magnitude around its
deterministic (noise free) value. Such a point of view
is rooted on the study of systems close to equilibrium,
whose dynamics can be linearized around the determin-
istic steady state. However, it does not hold in systems
far from equilibrium, where nonlinear corrections to the
dynamics must be taken into account. In these systems,
noise may not only be the responsible for the observed
behavior, but it may also make possible new states and
behaviors that do not exist in the noise-free limit [1]. Ex-
amples of such behaviors are, for instance, the enhance-
ment of the decay time of a metastable state (noise en-
hanced stability) [2, 3], the synchronization with a weak
periodic input signal (stochastic resonance) [4] or the ap-
pearance of a periodic output (coherence resonance) [5].
In systems with spatial degrees of freedom, noise may
lead for instance to the formation of convective struc-
tures (noise-sustained structures) [6].

The eﬀects of noise depend on whether it is additive
or multiplicative. Additive noise is present in all real,
non isolated systems where the environment acts as a
thermal bath. Moreover, even in an isolated system all
interaction processes exhibit some degree of stochastic
ﬂuctuations that lead to internal noise in the system.
This eﬀect may be further enhanced by adding noise to
In general, the
the control parameters of the system.

ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem implies that noise in a
nonlinear system may have both an additive and a multi-
plicative component. The eﬀects of both kinds of noise in
nonlinear systems have been thoroughly studied from the
theoretical point of view [1], although experimental stud-
ies of the eﬀects of multiplicative noise are more scarce.
In particular, it has been shown that the characteristic
signatures of either type of noise can be profoundly mod-
iﬁed by the presence of even a weak component of the
other kind [7, 8]. Moreover it was also found that multi-
plicative (parametric) noise induces a shift in the critical
mean value of the parameter that controls an instability
[9, 10, 11].

In this paper we analyze theoretically and experimen-
tally the inﬂuence of multiplicative noise on the mode
hopping dynamics of a bistable semiconductor laser.
Since the pumping current enters into the laser ﬁeld equa-
tions in a nonlinear way, adding current noise may lead
to multiplicative eﬀects. We ﬁnd that the residence times
of each mode are strongly aﬀected, and that increasing
the noise added to the current is equivalent —from the
point of view of residence times— to a lowering of the
bias current. A theoretical model for the system under
study is presented and analyzed, with the aim of un-
derstanding the observable consequences of the imposed
ﬂuctuations and the role of laser parameters. A better
insight is obtained by simpliﬁcation of this model to a
bistable potential system. This allows us to discuss in
detail the eﬀects of current noise on the mode hopping
dynamics. The results are in good agreement with the
experimental observations carried out for a bulk edge-
emitting semiconductor laser.

The outline of the paper is the following. In Sec. II
we introduce the rate equations for a two-mode semi-
conductor laser and we derive from them a reduced 1D
Langevin model that describes the hopping dynamics of

the freely operating laser. In Sec. III we discuss in de-
tail the reduced model and, in particular, the eﬀect of
external ﬂuctuations of the injection current. The limit
case of a slowly ﬂuctuating current is analyzed as well
and the results are compared with simulation of the rate
equations. Sec. IV is devoted to the presentation of the
experimental results. We draw our conclusions in Sec. V.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

A. Rate equations

Our starting point is a stochastic rate-equation model
for a semiconductor laser that may operate in two modes.
Both modes interact with a single carrier density that
provides the necessary gain. The two modes have very
similar linear gains, provided that their wavelengths are
almost equal and they are close to the gain peak.
If
E± denote the complex modal amplitudes, N the carrier
density and J(t) the injection current, the model can be
written as

where ε determines the diﬀerence in diﬀerential gain
among the two modes while Nc deﬁnes the carrier den-
sity where the unsaturated modal gains are equal. The
parameters s and c are respectively the self- and cross-
saturation coeﬃcients. The ξ± are two independent,

terpreted in Itˆo sense [13], thus the average power spon-
taneously emitted in each mode at any time is given by
4DspN .

j (t′)

= δijδ(t

The deterministic version of Eqs. (1-3) admits four dif-
ferent steady state solutions: the trivial solution E± = 0,
two single-mode solutions — E+
= 0, E− = 0 and
viceversa — and a solution where both modes are las-
= 0. The single-mode solution where only E+

The trivial solution E± = 0 is the only stable solution
for bias currents J < min(J+, J−); for deﬁniteness, we
consider Nc > 1, hence J− < 1 < J+. Upon increas-
ing J, the trivial solution looses stability and the system
switches to the solution E−
= 0, E+ = 0 at the laser
threshold, J = J−. Further increasing the current, the
sequence of bifurcations depends quite strongly on the
parameters s, c and Nc. For c > s, this solution may co-
= 0, E− = 0 or even with the
exist with the solution E+
= 0 (in this case, only for a small

current range). Finally, the solution E+
= 0, E− = 0
prevails.

B. Reduction to an eﬀective model

In order to better assess the eﬀects of current noise on
the modal dynamics, we next reduce the rate-equation
description to a bistable 1D system. In the ﬁrst place,
we introduce the amplitude-phase coordinates for each
mode,

E± = ρ± exp iψ±.

Using this standard transformations (see [14]) we obtain

(7)

Since the modal phases do not inﬂuence the evolution of
the modal amplitudes and carrier density, we can disre-
gard them without loss of generality. It is convenient to
perform a further change to “cylindrical” coordinates,

ρ+ = r cos φ,

ρ− = r sin φ .

(8)

In these new variables, r2 is the total power emitted by
the laser, and φ determines how this power is partitioned
among the two modes: φ = 0 (φ = π/2) corresponds to
emission in mode + (-) only, and intermediate values give
diﬀerent power to each mode.

Using again Ref. [14], we obtain

The parameter σ thus represents the gain saturation in-
duced by the total power in the laser, while δ —given by
the diﬀerence between the coeﬃcients of cross- and self-
saturation— describes the reduction in gain saturation
due to partitioning of the power among the two modes.
We also wish to remark that, although we worked in the
Itˆo formalism, this form of the equations would be the

The general expression just obtained for the dynam-
ics is too involved to allow for a detailed analysis of the
eﬀects of noise. In order to simplify the theoretical anal-
ysis of this dynamical system, we further assume that:
(i) The asymmetry of the modal gains is very small, i.
e., Nc >
1; (ii) the laser operates close to
threshold, so that the saturation term is small, σr2
∼
1.
In this limit, we ﬁnd that, to lowest order in the small
terms, the dynamics is governed by

so the dynamics of the total intensity r2 and of the carrier
density N decouple from those of the relative phase φ.
Thus φ is driven by the other two variables.

Moreover, the time-scale for the evolution of the rel-
ative phase φ is of second order in the small quantities,
while that of r and N is of the ﬁrst order. Since we are
mainly interested in time scales long enough for the relax-
ation oscillations of the total power and carrier density
to be totally damped, and not in the transient dynamics,
we can consider that r and N have reached the vicin-
ity of their steady state. By neglecting the spontaneous
emission term in (13), we have that

(16)

A more accurate approximation would be to solve the
Langevin equations for r and N and to insert the so-
lution into the equation for φ in order to describe how
the ﬂuctuations of the former aﬀect the dynamics of the
latter. For simplicity, we disregard this issue under the
assumption that the noise in (13) and (15) is so weak

that they simply ”follow” J as prescribed by (16). For a
time-dependent current this approximation is valid only
if J does not change too fast. For example, in the case of
an Orstein–Uhlenbeck process that will be considered be-
low one must require the corresponding correlation time
τ to be longer than the typical relaxation time of the to-
tal intensity. We shall see that this condition is generally
met in our experimental setups.

In this representation the dynamics can be geometri-
cally visualized as follows. The motion is constrained
along a manifold (approximated as portion of a circle of
radius r0) connecting the ﬁxed points. Radial ﬂuctua-
tions (i.e. ﬂuctuations in the total intensity output) are
completely neglected. The hopping dynamics is thus ef-
fectively one-dimensional and described by the ”phase”
variable φ, which determines how the total power is par-
titioned among the modes.

Altogether, the above calculation yields the reduced

Notice that the strength of ﬂuctuations Dφ depends on
the current. At this stage, one may get rid of one of the
three parameters. For example, one may rescale time t
→
√aξφ so that the only independent parameters
t/a; ξφ →
are b/a and Dφ/a. However, since we wish to understand
the role of the phenomenological parameters in relation
with the physical quantities we stick to the form (17).
This choice is especially useful when current ﬂuctuations
will be taken into account.

To conclude this Section, we point out that the
same equation (17) has been derived by Willemsen et
al. [15, 16] to describe polarization switches in Vertical
Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs). The starting
point of their derivation is the San Miguel-Feng-Moloney
model [17]. We point out that the physical meaning of the
variable φ is diﬀerent from here as it represents the po-
larization angle of emitted light. Thus the potential min-
ima correspond to the two orthogonal linearly–polarized
directions. Also, Nagler et al. [18, 19] have derived a one-
dimensional Langevin equation for the mode intensity in
VCSEL starting from a rate equation model for the ﬁeld
intensities in the two polarization directions. Indeed, it
can be shown that, upon the change of variable sin φ = p
and redeﬁnition of parameters, model (17) transforms
into eq. (19) and (23) of Ref. [18]. This suggests that,
upon a suitable reinterpretation of variables and parame-
ters, many of the results presented henceforth may apply
also to the dynamics of VCSELs.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE REDUCED MODEL

In this Section we analyze some features of the model
in the case in which J is a constant. In this case, (17)
is a one-dimensional Langevin equation with additive
noise originating from spontaneous emission. The force
in Eq. (17) can be derived from the potential

U (φ, Dφ) =

cos 4φ

with P0 being the normalization constant. Notice that
the potential depends explicitly on Dφ (i.e. on Dsp)
through the repulsive logarithmic term in (22). This term
is usually very small for weak noise except at the extrema
φ = 0, π/2 where it diverges logarithmically. As a con-
sequence, P vanishes linearly there. Physically, this cor-
responds to the fact that, due to spontaneous emission,
the modes are never completely switched oﬀ.

A. Bistability and eﬀect of the injection current

∞

The most important property that can be immediately
drawn from the form of U is that there exists a range
of current values J3 < J < J4 for which the system is
bistable. Within this region, the system has three sta-
tionary solutions, φ± (stable) and φ0 (unstable). To com-
pute them, let us neglect the term proportional to Dφ
in the deﬁnition of U : φ0

Those last expressions have been checked to be a good
approximation of the exact values computed from bifur-
cation analysis of the deterministic rate equations in the
limit of small ε and δ. The eﬀect of the term proportional
to Dφ in (22) is to make the bistability domain dependent
on the noise intensity, i.e. J3(Dφ) < J < J4(Dφ). By
computing numerically the stationary points of U (φ, Dφ)
we have found that the width of this interval of current
values is reduced upon increasing Dφ with respect to the
deterministic case. The current value J controls the sym-
metry of the potential through the term proportional to
b. Within the bistable region, at the critical value Js, b
vanishes and the eﬀective potential is symmetric under
the transformation φ
φ. In this situation the

The stationary distribution is thus straightforwardly

However, it turns out that this correction to the noise
is pretty small for the parameters we choose. More pre-
cisely, one can estimate that, for a given change of J, the
relative change of ∆U± is roughly a factor 10 larger than
the one of Dφ [21]. We thus neglect the correction terms
in (27) and let Dφ = Dφ(Js).

In other words, we assume that changing J only aﬀects
the barriers through formula (26). With this simpliﬁca-
tion the corresponding residence times are given by [20]

Here Ts is the residence time at the symmetry point.
Notice that the prefactor depends on the noise strength
to leading order. Formula (28) enlightens the role of
the asymmetry parameters in determining the residence
times. Indeed, it predicts that the residence times should
depend exponentially on the injection current with diﬀer-
ent rates. In particular, we see that increasing J around
Js may lead to an increase of both T± if 2εσ < δ or to an
increase of T+ accompained by a decrease of T− if instead
2εσ > δ. To discriminate which of the two cases is of rel-
evance one must thus know the values of the parameters
for the laser at hand. This can only be accomplished by
comparing with experimental data. For the laser at hand
(see below), the measurements indicate that the case of
interest is 2εσ > δ.

B. Comparison with the simulation of the rate
equations

Before proceeding further, we check the accuracy of
the reduction by comparing with simulations of the rate
equations. For deﬁneteness, we let ε = 0.1, s = 1.0,
Nc = 1.1, γ = 0.01 and c = 1.1 and perform diﬀer-
ent runs for diﬀerent values of Dsp and for J some 10%
above threshold. With the above choice, δ = 0.05 and
σ = 1.05, meaning that the timescale for the slow vari-
able φ is estimated to be about one order of magnitude
larger than those of the fast ones. We also set α = 0 since,
as explained above, we expect that the phase dynamics
should not matter. The largest part of the simulations
were performed with Euler method with time steps 0.01-
0.02. For comparison, some checks with Heun method [1]
have also been carried on. Within the statistical accu-
racy, the results are found to be insensitive the the choice
of the algorithm.

We ﬁrst evaluated the stationary distribution P (φ)
as evaluated from the data through the relation φ =

the numerically measured residence times T± with the
prediction of the reduced model (see again Fig. 1). Since
we work with values of the noise that are not extremely
small, we employed the quadrature formula [20]

The eﬀect of a time-dependent current is twofold.
First, the potential becomes ﬂuctuating: the a, b and Dφ

The barriers’ height depends linearly on δJ to leading
order. Obviously, this last expression makes sense only
when the ﬂuctuating term is sub-threshold i.e. whenever
the system is bistable (a large enough δJ could always
occur making the potential single-well). The second ef-
fect is on the additive noise strength. Since Dφ depends
on δJ the amplitude of spontaneous emission is renor-
correlated, the process

to write down also the full Langevin equation associated

For an arbitrary choice of the parameters, V has a diﬀer-
ent symmetry with respect to U meaning that the eﬀec-
tive amplitude of multiplicative noise is diﬀerent within
the two potential wells. If this diﬀerence is large enough,
current ﬂuctuation will remove the degeneracy between
the two stationary solutions.

Non-Markovian equations of the form (34) have been
thoroughly studied in the literature (see e.g. [22, 23, 24,
25] and references therein). Although their full analytical
solution for arbitrary τ is not generally feasible, several
approximate results can be provided in some limits. In
the following Section we will discuss the case which is of
experimental importance.

D. The kinetic limit

Altogether, the mode switching can be seen as an acti-
vated escape over ﬂuctuating barriers given by (32). The
statistical properties of the latter process is controlled
by the current ﬂuctuations. To assess the nature of the
stochastic process at hand, it is important to discuss the
relevant time scales. In particular, one should compare
the relaxation time TR within the wells with both τ and
the residence times T±. If TR < τ we are in the colored
noise case. An estimate of TR is the inverse of the cur-
vature at φ0 that is approximatively given by 1/a. For
example, with the set parameters chosen in Sec. III B one
ﬁnds TR ∼
In bulk semiconductor lasers the residence times are
generally much larger than TR (the switching time be-
10ns while
tween the two states). Typically, TR ∼
residence times may range between 1 and 100 µs. The
noise correlation time can be somehow tuned but the
noise generator limit τ to be larger of 100 ns (8.8 Mhz
is the maximal bandwidth used in the experiment, see
Section IV below). Moreover, the frequency of the re-
laxation oscillations of the total power is typically above
1 GHz, and its damping occurs on a ns time scale, in
accordance with the assumptions made in the theoretical
analysis.

At least to a ﬁrst approximation, we can thus consider
the limit of large τ . This justiﬁes a further reduction of
the problem to a kinetic description which amounts to
neglect intrawell motion and reduce to a rate model de-
scribing the statistical transitions in terms of transition
rates. If we consider τ as a time scale of the external driv-
ing we can follow the terminology of Ref. [26] and refer
to this situation as the “semiadiabatic” limit of Eq. (34).
We will now consider separately two limit cases.

1. Slow barrier, rare hops: TR ≪ τ ≪ T±

This corresponds to the situation in which spontaneous
emission noise is very weak. In this case the residence
time is basically the shortest escape time, which in turn
correspond to the lowest value of the barrier (the noise is
approximatively constant in the current range considered
henceforth). For the case of interest, δ < 2εσ we can use
(32) to infer that the minimal values of ∆U± should be
attained for δJ

√DJ respectively. This yields

Notice that δ controls the asymmetry level: if δ

reported below and also in the experiment.

2. Slow barrier, frequent hops: TR ≪ T± ≪ τ

This corresponds to the adiabatic limit in which the
time scale of the external driving is slower than the in-
trinsic dynamics of the system [26]. The results of this
subsection are thus not of direct relevance for interpret-
ing the experimental results reported here. However, we
discuss also this regime for completeness and to empha-
size the diﬀerences with respect to the previous case.

To a ﬁrst approximation we can here treat current ﬂuc-
tuations in a parametric way. The switch time will be the
average of escape times over the distribution of barrier
ﬂuctuations, i.e.
iδJ . Using again the approximation
(32), since the variable δJ is Gaussian, using the identity

(39)

This means that in this limit the residence times increase
exponentially with the noise variance (i.e. exponentially
with the square of RMS). In other words, the ﬂuctuations
always increase the eﬀective barriers albeit asymmetri-
cally.

E. Comparison with the rate equations in the
presence of current noise

The above analysis shows that the eﬀect of multiplica-
tive noise may strongly depend on the actual parameters
of the model, in particular of the ratio between ε and
δ. Accordingly, the simmetry-breaking eﬀects can vary

7

considerably depending on the parameter δ, see Eq. (38).
To further clarify this dependence and as a check of the
prediction, we performed some simulations of the rate
equations (1-3) together with (30). We investigated the
eﬀect of changing the value of the cross-saturation coeﬃ-
cient c, keeping the other parameters ﬁxed the same used
in Section III B. The DC value of the current J has been
again choosen empirically to yield an almost symmetric
distribution P (φ) for DJ = 0.

We set τ = 4

104 that correspond roughly to the
×
experimental values. In Fig. 2 we plot
ln P for c = 1.1
and c = 1.3 corresponding to δ = 0.05 and δ = 0.15
respectively. In the second case the multiplicative eﬀect
of the noise is stronger and leads to a sizeable distortion of
the curve while for small asymmetries the curves basically
mantain their symmetry.

The same type of behavior can be observed in the de-
pendence of the residence times on the current ﬂuctu-
ations. Fig. 3a illustrates how for c = 1.1 (δ = 0.05)
the residence times decrease at approximatively the same
rate upon increasing current ﬂuctuations and the ratio η

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Experimental set-up

The experimental setup is similar to the one de-
scribed in [27, 28]. Several edge-emitting semiconduc-
tor laser were tested: two Hitachi Hlp 1400 lasing at
840 nm and three Sharp LT021 MD lasing at 780 nm.
These lasers are GaAlAs double-hetero-structure with a
bulk active region and cleaved, uncoated facets. The
wavelength separation between consecutive longitudinal-
modes is around 0.3 nm, and the laser emission occurs
in a single-transverse mode. The laser package temper-
ature is stabilized up to 0.01oC and the laser current is
controlled with a very stable (up to 1 µA) power sup-
ply. The laser is optically isolated from the rest of the

8

set-up by means of an optical diode that avoid spurious
back reﬂection. The total laser emission is detected by
an Avalanche Photodiode detector (APD) (DC-1.5 GHz
bandwidth) while the time-averaged optical spectrum is
measured by an Agilent 86140B spectrum analyzer. Indi-
vidual longitudinal mode detection is obtained by send-
ing part of the laser output into a monochromator (res-
olution 0.5 ˚A) with two independent output slits. The
monochromator can be set in order to have at the two ex-
its two diﬀerent longitudinal modes emitted by the laser.
Each longitudinal mode intensity is then monitored by
two APD detectors (DC-1.5 GHz bandwidth) placed be-
yond the slits. The outputs from these detectors are
monitored on a LeCroy 7200A (500 MHz analogue band-
width, 1 GS/s). The power spectra of the signals can be
monitored using an Agilent E4403B spectrum analyzer.

Two control parameters can be directly varied in this
system: the pumping current J and the temperature of
the laser substrate Tsub. As described in [27, 28], the
optical spectra of the lasers tested show a single longi-
tudinal mode emission for most of the parameter values
(J, Tsub). However, there exist small regions in the pa-
rameter space where the lasers are bistable and exhibit
mode-hopping between two longitudinal modes. A basic
explanation of the destabilization of the leading longi-
tudinal mode is that, ﬁxing the Tsub and increasing J
the wavelength of the cavity resonance increases due to
Joule heating of the semiconductor medium. The gain
curve peak shifts towards longer wavelength as well, but
at a larger rate. Eventually, the dominating longitudinal
mode looses its stability in favour of a longer wavelength
one, which has become more resonant with the gain peak.
The same happens when, for ﬁxed J, Tsub is increased.
This type of transition among lasing modes is well-known
[12] and occurs sharply in the parameter space.

Observation of this regime of stochastic mode-hopping
has been reported in several papers [27, 29, 30]. Its most
relevant features are: (i) the total emitted intensity re-
mains almost constant though each longitudinal mode is
switching on and oﬀ. In other words, the anti-correlation
of the two modal intensities is very strong (better than
0.95 in our case); (ii) the distribution of residence times
−
in a mode, deﬁned as the interval between a switching-
on and a switching-oﬀ event, is Poissonian; (iii) a sweep
of the pump current across this parameters’ region, re-
veals the existence of an hysteresis cycle for the modal
emission which is a signature of bistability between the
two longitudinal modes. It is thus clear that these fea-
tures are straightforwardly explained by the theoretical
analysis presented above.

The study of the ﬂuctuations of the laser emission can
be carried out by monitoring the modal intensities nor-
malized to the total intensity output: mI = iI /itot and
mII = iII /itot. The mode labeled with I is the one

with larger wavelength. These are related to ρ± deﬁned
in the theoretical analysis, by mI,II = ρ2
0. Then,
it is useful to represent the state of the system in the
1/2). Hence, the variable φ used
phase space (mI
in the theory is simply the angle that this vector forms
with the horizontal axis. The strong anticorrelation of
the modal intensities implies that the modulus of this
vector is almost constant and equal to one.
In Fig. 4
we plot the the probability distribution function in the
1/2). The maxima of the distribution
space (mI
correspond to the two stable modes involved in the hop-
ping. It is evident that the relevant dynamics occur on
a portion of the unit circle as assumed in the simpliﬁed
theory.

The probability distribution functions of the angular
variable φ as obtained from the experiment are reported
in Fig. 5 for diﬀerent values of the pumping current. For
every φ we have included in the histograms all the points
along the radial direction. Two peaks located around
φ = 0.2 and φ = 1.4 are found, corresponding to the ac-
tivation of the mode I and II respectively. In Fig. 5a we
plot the distribution of φ for the case of Fig. 4, where the
modal emission is symmetric, J
Js. The measurements
show that upon changing the pumping current an asym-
metric situation settles down, where the laser emission
on one of the two modes is favored. In particular, an de-
crease (resp. increase) of J with respect the value of Fig.
4, enhances the stability of the mode labeled by II (resp.
I), see Fig. 5b,c respectively. In all cases, the logarithm
of the distribution can be ﬁtted with the function (see

dicted by formula (28), both times depend exponentially

Incidentally, this implies that the quantity (TI + TII )/2
increases with the current, meaning that hops become

more and more rare. Moreover, the ratio η = TI/TII
increases exponentially with the current as shown in the
inset of Fig. 6. This behaviour is also consistent with
formula (28).

C. Eﬀect of noise addition onto the pumping
current

In a semiconductor laser driven by a constant (DC)
current, the main source of noise is the spontaneous emis-
sion within the semiconductor medium. This noise source
cannot be varied directly through the control parameters.
Fluctuations can be added into the system externally by
adding electrical noise on the pumping current. This sig-
nal employed in our setup has zero-mean, a bandwidth
ranging from 100 Hz to 8.8 MHz and it is AC-coupled to
the laser bias current.

In Fig. 7a we show how the average residence times
TI,II change upon increasing the current noise level
around the static value Js. The times are aﬀected in a
strongly asymmetric way: while TII is almost unchanged,
TI decreases exponentially. In Fig. 7b we plot the prob-
ability distribution function of the angular variable φ for
diﬀerent values of the pump noise. The experimental ev-
idence conﬁrms that the asymmetry of the probability
distribution increases upon increasing the noise level. It
is interesting to remark that an increase of noise level is
equivalent, from the point of view of the residence times,
to a decrease of the DC pumping current. This experi-
mental result conﬁrms that the imposed noise does aﬀect
the dynamics in a multiplicative way. The qualitative

The measurements are performed on a laser sample diﬀerent
from the one used for Figs. 4,5, 6, requiring slightely mod-
iﬁed values for the control parameters to obtain the same

agreement between the experimental data and the simu-
lations reported in Figs. 2b and 3b supports the validity
of our modelling. The exponential dependence of the
ratio η on the RMS of the ﬂuctuation predicted by the
analysis of the reduced model, Eq. (38), is indeed ob-
served in the experiment (see Fig. 8). This is another
indication that conﬁrms that the kinetic description suf-
ﬁces to capture the mode-hopping dependence on noise
level.

ter of its ﬂuctuations. Numerical simulations of the rate
equations are in good qualitative agreement with the ex-
perimental observations. Moreover, the reduction of this
model to a 1D Langevin equation describing activated
escape over a ﬂuctuating barrier has allowed us to draw
some predictions (e.g. the dependence of residence times
on noise strength) and to better understand the role of
the physical parameters. Depending on their values, the
ﬂuctuating part of the eﬀective potential may have a dif-
ferent parity with respect to the static one. This explains
the observation that imposed ﬂuctuations have diﬀerent
eﬀects on the hopping rates (symmetry breaking).

The reduced model and many of the results presented
here could be useful to describe also polarization switch-
ing in VCSELs driven by external noise. Indeed, exper-
imental data show strong similarities between this phe-
nomenon [31, 32] and the longitudinal mode dynamics.
On the theoretical side, this analogy is supported by the
fact that the polarization dynamics in VCSELs is de-
scribed by models that are very similar to the one dis-
cussed here [15, 16, 18]. The inclusion of current noise
eﬀects along the same line above reported should be fea-
sible once the typical time scales and parameters for such
a class of lasers are evaluated. This work, that we plan
to undertake in the future, will provide a common theo-
retical basis to the stochastic dynamics of bistable semi-
conductor lasers.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have explored experimentally and
theoretically the eﬀects of external current noise on
the mode-hopping dynamics of a bistable semiconductor
laser. We have shown that the residence times of each
mode are strongly aﬀected, bearing the typical signatures
of multiplicative noise. We have investigate a theoretical
model based on a rate-equation description, where the
bias current enters parametrically into the evolution of
the modal amplitudes, hence the multiplicative charac-

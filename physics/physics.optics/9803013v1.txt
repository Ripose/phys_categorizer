Abstract

The eﬀect of dispersion or diﬀraction on zero-velocity solitons is studied for
the generalized massive Thirring model describing a nonlinear optical ﬁber
with grating or parallel-coupled planar waveguides with misaligned axes. The
Thirring solitons existing at zero dispersion/diﬀraction are shown numerically
to be separated by a ﬁnite gap from three isolated soliton branches. Inside the
gap, there is an inﬁnity of multi-soliton branches. Thus, the Thirring solitons
are structurally unstable. In another parameter region (far from the Thirring
limit), solitons exist everywhere.

The massive Thirring model (MTM) [1] is a completely integrable [2] Lorentz-invariant
model of classical ﬁeld theory, which supports exact soliton and multi-soliton solutions [1].
A generalization of the MTM, which we call the optical model (OM), was introduced in
[3,4] to describe interaction between right- and left-traveling waves in a nonlinear optical
ﬁber with a grating. Resonant Bragg scattering and cross-phase modulation (CPM) give
rise, respectively, to linear and nonlinear couplings between the two waves. OM additionally
includes self-phase-modulation (SPM) nonlinear terms, making it nonintegrable and destroy-
ing Lorentz invariance. Nevertheless, a family of exact one-solitons can be found [4,3] with
arbitrary velocity and internal amplitude (“soliton” hereafter means solitary wave, and “n-
soliton” is one with n peaks). Recently, Bragg solitons have been observed experimentally
in a ﬁber with grating [5].

Both MTM and OM neglect dispersion of the medium, solitons being supported by an
eﬀective dispersion induced by the linear coupling.
In physical media, however, material
dispersion is present. The aim of this work is to examine the inﬂuence of such dispersion D
on the Thirring solitons (TS). This ﬁrst study treats only zero-velocity solitons, which are
essentially the same in MTM and OM. Results for ﬁnite-velocity ( walking [6]) solitons, to
be presented elsewhere, are more complicated technically but not drastically diﬀerent (see
below). The zero-velocity solitons are most intriguing physically, as they imply complete
dynamical self-trapping of light on the grating. We will conclude that TS are structurally
unstable (which does not imply their dynamical instability), being separated by a ﬁnite gap
from the nearest branch of fundamental-solitons for D > 0, and with no solitary waves at
all for D < 0. Within the gap, we ﬁnd inﬁnite sequences of two-solitons that are bound
states (BS’s) of the fundamental ones. Although likely to be dynamically unstable [7], BS’s
are worth studying to delimit the existence domain of fundamental solitons, see Figs. 2,4
below.

The generalized MTM including dispersion terms is

iut + iux + Duxx + (cid:16)σ|u|2 + |v|2
ivt − ivx + Dvxx + (cid:16)|u|2 + σ|v|2

(cid:17) u + v = 0,
(cid:17) v + u = 0,

(1)

(2)

where u(x, t) and v(x, t) are the complex amplitudes of the counterpropagating waves, x
and t are the coordinate and time, D is the coeﬃcient of spatial dispersion, and σ is the
relative SPM coeﬃcient, which is zero for MTM, and 1
2 for the OM case. Besides ﬁbers
with grating, the model (1), (2) can be applied to stationary ﬁelds in two parallel tunnel-
coupled planar nonlinear waveguides. In that case t and x are the propagation distance and
the transverse coordinate respectively, the terms ±iux account for misalignment of optical
axes in the two cores, D is an eﬀective diﬀraction (not dispersion) coeﬃcient, and the CPM
terms must be omitted (see, e.g., [8]). Actually, the latter realization of the model is closer to
experiment, as optical axes misalignment is a powerful control parameter enabling rescaling
of physically realistic systems into the form (1), (2) [8]. In contrast, for ﬁbers with grating,
a simple estimate shows that dispersion may not be conspicuous unless the spatial width of
the soliton is comparable to the grating period, i.e. the wavelength of light, when Eqs. (1)
and (2) are not applicable [9]

Essentially the same model governs interaction of two circular polarizations of light in a
nonlinear ﬁber, in which the linear coupling is induced by the birefringence, and the group-
velocity diﬀerence by a ﬁber’s twist (see the review [10]). In untwisted ﬁbers, interaction

2

between linear polarizations is described by similar models but with linear coupling replaced
by a cubic four-wave-mixing term (see [11] for a family of walking solitons in the latter
model). Our approach is diﬀerent; instead of starting from solitons of decoupled nonlinear-
Schr¨odinger equations with the couplings treated as perturbations, we start from the TS of
the strongly coupled system with dispersion or diﬀraction being a perturbation.

Being interested here only in the zero-velocity solitons, we substitute into Eqs. (1) and

(2) u(x, t) = e−iωtU(x), v = e−iωtV (x) to obtain the coupled ODEs
DU ′′ + iU ′ + ωU + (σ|U|2 + |V |2)U + V = 0,
DV ′′ − iV ′ + ωV + (|U|2 + σ|V |2)V + U = 0,

the prime standing for d/dx. In this notation, the TS occur at D = 0 and |ω| < 1. Eqs. (3)
and (4) are equivalent to an 8th-order dynamical system with two integrals of motion: the
Hamiltonian

H = D(|U ′|2 + |V ′|2) + ω(|U|2 + |V |2) + (σ/2)(|U|4 + |V |4)

+|U|2|V |2 + (UV ∗ + V U ∗),

and the “angular momentum”, generated by invariance with respect to the continuous phase
transformation,

M = D (cid:16)UU ′∗

− U ∗U ′ + V V ′∗

− V ∗V ′

(cid:17) + |V |2 − |U|2.

This Hamiltonian system has several discrete symmetries: the odd symmetry Z : (U, V ) →
(−U, −V ), two other Z2 ones Z1 : U ↔ V ∗, Z2 : U ↔ −V ∗, and four reversibilities

R : (U, U ′, V, V ′) → (U ∗, −U ′∗

, V ∗, −V ′∗
S : (U, U ′) ↔ (V, −V ′), : x → −x ,

), : x → −x ,

along with their odd images ZR and ZS.

The ﬁrst step in locating solitary waves is to solve the linearized problem, assuming

solutions ∼ eλx. This problem, solved exactly, gives a set of double eigenvalues:

(cid:16)D2λ4 + 2Dωλ2 + λ2 + ω2 − 1(cid:17)

2

= 0 .

Eq. (9) deﬁnes four regions on the plane {D, ω} with diﬀerent types of eigenvalues (see Fig.
1). Solitary-waves with exponentially decaying tails are only possible in regions I, II, and
III (and their images for D < 0), where eigenvalues with nonzero real part occur.

We notice that Eqs. (3) and (4) are compatible with the reduction U = V ∗. This results

in a single equation for U(x),

DU ′′ + iU ′ + ωU + (1 + σ)|U|2U + U ∗ = 0,

(10)

equivalent to a real fourth-order ODE system. All the zero-velocity solitons in MTM and
OM obey exactly the same reduction, and a simple argument based on consideration of the
unstable manifolds shows that all possible zero-velocity solitons to (1), (2) within region II
are trivially related to solutions of (10) by rotation in the (U, V ) plane. Henceforth, we set
σ = 0 because σ can be scaled out from Eq. (10). Furthermore, for Eq. (10), S ≡ R, and
the “angular momentum” (6) identically vanishes. The eigenvalues of the corresponding
linearized equation are given by Eq. (9), but are all single, i.e., Fig. 1 remains fully relevant.

FIG. 1. Parameter regions for D > 0 with diﬀerent types of eigenvalues of the linearized Eqs.
(3) and (4), as illustrated by the insets. The curve delimiting region II is D + 1/4D − ω = 0. At
the point D = 1
2 , the curve is tangent to the horizontal ω = −1. The picture for D < 0 is obtained
by rotating the ﬁgure by 180◦.

The soliton is a homoclinic-to-zero solution to Eq. (10). According to general theorems
[12], in region III, where U = 0 is a saddle-center ﬁxed point, homoclinic trajectories that
are symmetric under a reversibility are of codimension one (non-symmetric homoclinic tra-
jectories are of codimension two). Hence solutions can exist only on isolated curves in the
{D, ω} parameter plane, the number of which may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Moreover, given a
sign condition on the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian, each curve will be accompanied
by an inﬁnite accumulation of curves on which BS’s exist [12].
In contrast, in regions I
and II, where the ﬁxed point U = 0 is hyperbolic, homoclinic trajectories are generic, i.e.,
they occur uniformly in two-dimensional parameter regions [13]. But region III is of most
interest, as it abuts the segment {D = 0, |ω| < 1} on which the TS solitons exist.

To obtain solutions, we use robust numerical methods for solving two-point boundary-
value problems on a truncation of an inﬁnite x-interval with boundary conditions placing the
solution in the stable or unstable eigenspaces at the origin; see [14] and references therein.
Continuation of solutions with respect to parameters is carried out using the software auto
[15], speciﬁcally exploit the reversible structure of (10).

Our main ﬁndings are summarized in Fig. 2. Here, three solid curves represent the
isolated loci of fundamental or primary (single-humped, in one component) solitons, and
the dashed curves are a small sample of loci of their two-humped BS’s. All primary-solitons
are reversible with respect to the transformation ZR, see Eq. (7); we have found no evidence
of any R-reversible solutions. In panel (b), we use, instead of the frequency ω, the soliton’s
+∞
−∞ |U(x)|2dx. Typical examples of one-solitons are displayed in Fig. 3. and
energy E =
R
typical two-humped BS’s are shown in Fig. 4 (only half of each two-soliton is shown in this
ﬁgure).

(Fig. 2) by the line ω = −0.8.

Each of the primary branches in Fig. 2 (labeled 1–3) appears to bifurcate at zero soliton
amplitude from the line ω = 1, although there are numerical diﬃculties in computing right
up to this singular limit. The D -values of these three bifurcations at ω = 1 are D = 0.50,
0.20 and 0.11 to two decimal places. A straightforward calculation of the sign condition
in [12] on the Hamiltonian (5) implies that curves of ZR-reversible BS’s must accumulate
on each of primary curves from both sides (e.g. we have found BS branches 9–12 and 4,5
accumulating on branch 1 from the right and left respectively). Branches 9–12 are also part
of a larger sequence we have computed which for ﬁxed D accumulates on ω = 1.

Three-solitons and higher-order BS of the primary solitons can also be found, the three-

5

humped ones accumulating on two-solitons, etc. in accord with the theory [12]. We do not
describe these objects because it is unlikely that even the two-solitons may be dynamically
stable in the PDE system (1),(2), while stability of the primary solitons is quite feasible
[7]. However, stability analysis is deferred to another work. Homoclinic solutions were also
sought for D < 0 and |ω| < 1, but no evidence of primary or multi-humped ones was found.
Looking at Fig. 2, there remains the crucial question whether there are any more primary
branches to the left of that labeled 3. A seemingly plausible conjecture is that there is a
self-similar structure of primary branches as one moves to the left in Fig. 2, i.e., inﬁnitely
many branches accumulating on the TS segment {D = 0, |ω| < 1}, the branches 1,2 and 3
being but the ﬁrst three in the structure (note that, at least for D < 2, there cannot be any
further primary solutions to the right of branch 1, because here the two-soliton curves 9–12
form a barrier for them). However, careful numerical scanning of the parametric plane of
Fig. 2 to the left of branch 3 has strongly indicated that the above hypothesis is false, in
region III there being no primary branches other than 1, 2, and 3. For ω suﬃciently close
to −1, this assertion is substantiated as follows

Fig 4. reports the results of a thorough numerical investigation of other possible solution
branches at ω = −0.99, varying D between 0 and 1
2. We ﬁnd that, to the left of branch
3, an inﬁnite sequence of multi-soliton BS’s occurs. Even though, because of numerical
problems in the singular limit, we have only computed the corresponding two-solitons down
to D ≈ 0.2, Fig. 4 clearly suggests accumulation of the sequence as D → 0. The energy of
the two-solitons remains ﬁnite, while the separation between the two bound pulses diverges
∼ 1/D as D → 0 (which explains the existence of TS in the limit D = 0). Thus, what does
accumulate on the TS manifold at D → 0 is an inﬁnite sequence of multi-soliton branches,
with no fundamental-soliton branch closer to the TS manifold than the branch 3 in Fig. 2.
To support this numerical ﬁnding with qualitative arguments, consider what happens
to the primary branches as they cross the line ω = −1 from above. For D > 1
2 this is a
“harmless” transition, because the real eigenvalues of the linearized equations, that govern
the decay of the homoclinic solution at |x| → ∞, behave smoothly and they are bounded
away from zero. A well-deﬁned primary branch safely crosses ω = −1 in this case, which
for ω < −1 describes a curve of “orbit-ﬂip” bifurcations (cf. [16]). However, for D < 1
2 , the
corresponding eigenvalues vanish as ω → −1, hence no smooth transition can take place.
Thus, there may be no primary-soliton branches at 0 < 1 + ω ≪ 1, D < 1
2.

The most important result of this work is that there is a ﬁnite gap separating TS, exist-
ing in the singular limit D = 0, from new solitons at D 6= 0. Thus, the Thirring solitons
are structurally unstable against adding the dispersion or diﬀraction. A natural question
is if there is a gap for solitons at a ﬁnite velocity. Preliminary numerical results give a
positive answer, which is further supported by an argument that solutions to the ODEs
describing the soliton’s shape continuously depend on the parameters (including velocity),
except at a singular point. The addition of dispersion to MTM is, obviously, a singular per-
turbation because it doubles the system’s order; however, nonzero velocity is not a singular
perturbation.

We mention ﬁnally results for solitons in regions I and II. As stated, here homoclinic
solutions are generic, and a primary soliton branch can be path-followed continuously for
all ω and D inside regions I and II. Inside region II it develops oscillations in its tails due
to the complex eigenvalues. At the boundaries between regions I and III and II and IV, the
solution disappears through a zero-amplitude bifurcation, as predicted by the appropriate
normal-form analysis [17]. Other primary-soliton solutions have more complicated bifurca-
tion diagrams; in both regions I and II, two- and multi-soliton BS’s also occur. A detailed
description of the complete bifurcation structure will be given elsewhere.

Since the original submission of this paper, we have become aware of the preprint [18],
containing new results on the dynamical stability of the solitons in OM without the dispersion
terms. They demonstrate that, except for the integrable Thirring model case, all the solitons
are subject to an instability which is too weak to have been observed in earlier numerical
simulations. Note that a similar instability mechanism for solitons of OM was predicted
non-rigourously in [19] using a variational approximation. A dynamical stability analysis
for the new solitons in the presence of dispersion found in the present work will be presented
elsewhere.

We appreciate valuable discussions with Y.S. Kivshar, G.G. Luther and D.E. Pelinovsky.

Abstract: Numerical examination of the solution of the boundary–value problem of the re-
ﬂection and transmission of a plane wave due to a slab of an electro–optic structurally chiral
material (SCM) indicates that the exhibition of the circular Bragg phenomenon by the SCM
can be controlled not only by the sign and the magnitude of a dc electric ﬁeld but also by its
orientation in relation to axis of helicoidal nonhomogeneity of the SCM. Thereby, the possibility
of electrical control of circular–polarization ﬁlters has been extended.

Introduction

×

In Part 1 [1], we formulated the boundary–value problem of the reﬂection and transmission of an
arbitrary plane wave due to a slab of an electro–optic structurally chiral material (SCM) in terms
4 matrix ordinary diﬀerential equation. A SCM slab is helicoidally nonhomogeneous in
of a 4
the thickness direction, and therefore must exhibit the circular Bragg phenomenon (CBP).
Endowed with one of 20 classes of point group symmetry, the SCM slab was subjected in Part 1
to a dc electric ﬁeld parallel to its axis of nonhomogeneity. The enhancement of the CBP by the
application of the axial dc electric ﬁeld has either switching or circular–polarization–rejection
applications in optics. The twin possibilities of thinner ﬁlters and electrical control of the CBP,
depending on the local crystallographic class as well as the constitutive parameters of the SCM,
emerged.

Our objective here is to generalize the theory of Part 1 to the application of an arbitrarily
oriented dc electric ﬁeld in order to control the CBP. The matrix ordinary diﬀerential equation
then becomes more complicated, even if the plane wave is normally incident. However, the
exhibition of the CBP is not in doubt, in general, as it depends solely on the structural chirality
of the SCM.

The plan of this paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a brief description of the optical
permittivity matrix of a SCM, and the Oseen transformation is employed to derive the 4
4
matrix ordinary diﬀerential equation. Section 3 contains an account of numerical results and

the conclusions drawn therefrom on the alignment of the dc electric ﬁeld in relation to the
exhibition of the CBP.

The notation is the same as for Part 1. Vectors are denoted in boldface; the cartesian
unit vectors are represented by ˆux, ˆuy, and ˆuz; symbols for column vectors and matrixes are
decorated by an overbar; and an exp(
iωt) time–dependence is implicit with ω as the angular
frequency.

2 Theoretical formulation

We are interested in the reﬂection and transmission of plane waves due to a SCM slab of thickness
L. The axis of helicoidal nonhomogeneity of the SCM is designated as the z axis, and the SCM
is subjected to a uniform dc electric ﬁeld Edc. The half–spaces z
L are vacuous.
0.
An arbitrarily polarized plane wave is obliquely incident on the SCM from the half–space z
L,
0 and z
As a result, reﬂected and transmitted plane waves exist in the half–spaces z
respectively. A boundary–value problem has to be solved in order to determine the reﬂection
and transmission coeﬃcients.

2.1 Structurally chiral material

As the electro–optic SCM has the z axis as its axis of helicoidal nonhomogeneity and is subjected
to a dc electric ﬁeld Edc, the optical relative permittivity matrix of this material may be stated

2.2 Propagation in the SCM

The Maxwell curl postulates for the chosen SCM slab are given by

H(x, y, z) =

E(x, y, z) )

where ǫo and µo are the permittivity and the permeability of free space (i.e., vacuum).

As a plane wave is incident obliquely on the SCM,

z we set [1]

∀

E(x, y, z) = e(z) exp [iκ(x cos φ + y sin φ)]

H(x, y, z) = h(z) exp [iκ(x cos φ + y sin φ)] )

,

where the wavenumber κ and the angle φ are determined by the incidence conditions. The
essential part of the Maxwell curl postulates can then be stated in terms of the column vector

As in Part 1[1], it is advantageous to exploit the Oseen transformation by deﬁning the

column vector

The propagation vector of the incident plane wave makes an angle θ

[0, π/2) with respect
∈
to the +z axis, and is inclined to the x axis in the xy plane by an angle ψ
[0, 2π]; accordingly,
the transverse wavenumber κ = ko sin θ, where ko = ω√ǫoµo is the wavenumber in free space.
The free–space wavelength is denoted by λo = 2π/ko. The vectors

reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, which appear as the elements of the 2

3 Numerical results and conclusion

With respect to the orientation of Edc, the right side of (13) can be divided into three parts.
The ﬁrst part is indiﬀerent to Edc and therefore to χdc, the second shows itself at maximum
advantage for axial dc electric ﬁelds (i.e., when χdc = 90◦), whereas the third is most eﬀective
for transverse dc electric ﬁelds (i.e., when χdc = 0◦). The eﬀects of the ﬁrst part have been
studied extensively already [3], and those of the second part have been the focus of Part 1 as
well as of other papers RL06,RLno2

¸

.

When considering the eﬀects of the third part as well as the interplay of the second and the
third parts, we must keep in mind that the number of variables for a comprehensive parametric
study is large. These variables include the local isotropy, uniaxiality, or biaxiality, as determined
by the relative values of ǫ(0)
1,2,3; the local point group symmetry of which there are 20 classes, as
determined by the relative values of rJK ; the two angles of incidence θ and φ; the angle χ of
the tilt dyadic, the half–pitch Ω, and the normalized thickness L/Ω; and the angle χdc. Given
this plethora of variables, we had to restrict the scope of our investigation.

With guidance from the results reported for Part 1, we chose to focus on a locally biax-
ial SCM, since such materials can oﬀer high electro–optic coeﬃcients which would lower the
magnitude of the applied dc electric ﬁeld. In particular, we opted for the orthorhombic mm2
class, choosing the relative permittivity scalars and the electro–optic coeﬃcients the same as for
potassium niobate [6]. Furthermore, normal incidence is the most common condition for using
planar optical devices, and so we set θ = 0◦. Finally, the eﬀect of φ not being signiﬁcant on the
exhibition of the CBP [1], we set φ = 0◦.

SCM with half–pitch Ω = 150 nm and tilt angle χ = 90◦, when Edc = 107 V m−1 and χdc
∈
[0◦, 90◦]. No dependence on χdc in the six plots presented actually indicates that the magnitude
of the dc electric ﬁeld is too low to have any signiﬁcant eﬀect; indeed, the spectrums are virtually
the same as for Edc = 0. The high ridge in the plot of RRR located at λo
667 nm, and its
absence in the plot of RLL, are signatures of the CBP, along with the trough in the plot of TRR.
109 V m−1 — the
same value as used for Fig. 8 of Part 1. This magnitude is high enough to have an eﬀect on the
CBP, which also means that the reﬂectance and the transmittance spectrums change with χdc.
The center–wavelength of the Bragg regime is 646 nm and the full–width–at–half–maximum
bandwidth is 69 nm for χdc = 90◦, but the corresponding quantities are 667 nm and 40 nm for
χdc = 0◦. In addition, the peak value of RRR diminishes by about 10% as χdc changes from 90◦
to 0◦.

The situation changes signiﬁcantly when the sign of Edc is altered, as exempliﬁed by Fig. 3
109 V m−1. The center–wavelength of the Bragg regime is 688 nm and
for Edc =
the full–width–at–half–maximum bandwidth is 15 nm for χdc = 90◦, but the corresponding
quantities remain at 667 nm and 40 nm for χdc = 0◦.
In addition, the peak value of RRR
increases by about 600% as χdc changes from 90◦ to 0◦. Thus, the exhibition of the CBP is
aﬀected dramatically in the center–wavelength, the bandwidth, and the peak co–handed and

co–polarized reﬂectance by the sign of Edc as well as the orientation angle χdc.

Whereas Figs. 2 and 3 were drawn for SCMs with χ = 90◦, calculations for Figs. 4 and 5
were made for χ = 45◦. These two ﬁgures indicate a blue–shifting of the CBP on the order of
100 nm as χdc changes from 90◦ to 0◦. Furthermore, the bandwidth is greatly aﬀected by the
value of χdc and the sign of Edc; indeed, the CBP vanishes for χdc in the neighborhood of 50◦
109 V m−1. Thus, the exhibition of the CBP is in two diﬀerent ranges of
when Edc = 0.67
χdc that do not overlap but are in proximity of each other.

Other types of Bragg phenomenons may appear in the spectral response characteristics. For
example, Fig. 4 shows a high–RRL ridge which suggests that the electro–optic SCM can be
made to function like a normal mirror (high RRL and RLR) in a certain spectral regime than
like a structurally right–handed chiral mirror (high RRR and low RLL) [7].

We conclude that the exhibition of the circular Bragg phenomenon by an electro–optic
structurally chiral material can be controlled not only by the sign and the magnitude of a dc
electric ﬁeld but also by its orientation in relation to axis of helicoidal nonhomogeneity. Although
we decided to present numerical results here only for normal incidence, several numerical studies
conﬁrm that our conclusions also apply to oblique incidence. Thus, the possibility of electrical
control of circular–polarization ﬁlters, that emerged in Part 1, has been reaﬃrmed and extended.
Theoretical studies on particulate composite materials with electro–optic inclusions [8] suggest
the attractive possibility of fabricating porous SCMs with sculptured–thin–ﬁlm technology [3].

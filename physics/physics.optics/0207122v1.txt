Abstract

The origin of Kerr type nonlinearity of the medium as a result of
the interaction between photons via Dirac delta-potential is presented
in the formalism adopted from the photon wave function approach. In
the view of the result the optical soliton may be treated as a bound
state (cluster) of many photons.

1 Introduction

To describe photon in terms of a one-particle wave function, i.e., on the ﬁrst
quantization level, we follow the way presented in [1, 2, 3]. Another approach
was proposed in [4, 5]. The concept of the position-representation photon
wave function has a long history and is still controversial. Nevertheless we do
not want to discuss the question here. The reader interested in this problem
is referred to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and references therein. In this paper the
concept serves us as a convenient tool.

The starting point for us is the free photon Schr¨odinger equation [1, 2, 3].
On this basis we develop the description of photon in medium in terms of

the photon wave function. Some attempts of this kind have been presented
in [1, 2, 3]. What is new in our approach is to show that the inﬂuence of the
medium on the photon can be described through some potentials. Though
generally the idea is not new, see e.g. [8, 9], but here we realize it within the
formalism of the photon wave function. This approach can be easily extended
to the case of many interacting photons. For a large number of photons,
it results as a nonlinear optics.
In particular, taking as a simple model
the photons interacting via Dirac delta-potential one obtains (in Hartree
approximation) the Kerr type nonlinearity of the medium. The problem of
interactions of photons via delta-potential and the Kerr nonlinearity of the
medium has its vast literature, especially in the context of quantization of
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation ([10, 11] and references therein). But all the
literature refers to the procedure of creation-annihilation operators.

The paper is organized in the following way. We begin the Section 2 with
the brief description of a single photon in the medium. On this basis we
extend the approach to the case of many interacting photons. We present
that in Hartree approximation the many-photon quantum Schr¨odinger equa-
tion takes on the form similar to the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The
obtained equation expressed in terms of classical language is nothing else but
Maxwell equations with material relations in the form of Kerr type nonlin-
earity. In Section 3 we summarize results and give some ﬁnal remarks.

In order to describe the propagation of photon in dielectric, one should
include in Hamiltonian the interaction term. On the microscopic level, such
interaction is rather complicated, but here we will take it into account in a
phenomenological way. We assume that the photon treated as a quantum
object ’feels’ the medium as an external classical ﬁeld. For a stationary state
the wave function takes on the form

ψω = φω(r) exp(

iωt), where φω(r) =

Generally, the couplings of the medium with the electric and magnetic part
of the wave function may be diﬀerent. To take it into account we introduce
two real and symmetric matrices γ and η which split the wave function ψω
into electric and magnetic parts

γψω + ηψω = ψω,

The projection operators γ, η fulﬁll the following relations i.e.: γ2 = γ, η2 =
η, γη = 0. When the couplings with the electrical and magnetic parts are
taken into account, the Schr¨odinger equation takes on the form

¯hωψω = Hf ψω

Ωω(r)γψω.

Ωω(r)γ, Γω(r)η have interpretation of potential energy operators. Ωω(r) is
connected with the dielectric susceptibility χω(r) = Ωω(r)/¯hω, and Γω(r)
with magnetic susceptibility χm
ω (r) = Γω(r)/¯hω.

where the ﬁrst term is the sum of N identical one-particle Hamiltonians in
the form given by equation (2) - each describing evolution of a free pho-
ton, the second term describes their coupling to the non-magnetic medium
(Γω = 0), and the third term is the sum taken over all the photon-photon
interactions Hlj. It may be any mechanism leading eﬀectively to the weak
interaction between photons. The main assumption is that the interaction
can be modeled by Dirac δ-function (when the two photons are simultane-
ously in a very small volume element V of the space). The measure of its
intensity is given by a parameter Aω. Because the photon-photon interaction
is performed with the help of the medium, and the dielectric medium acts
eﬀectively only on the electrical component of the wave function, therefore
the matrix γ should appear in the Hamiltonian Hlj:

Hlj = AωV γδ(rl

rj).

The Schr¨odinger equation for the N photons takes on the form

i¯h∂tψ(r1, . . . , rN , t) = Hψ(r1, . . . , rN , t).

The position-representation N-photon wave function ψ(r1, . . . , rN , t) is con-
structed in a similar way as the one constructed previously for one photon

It is due to the fact that in deﬁnition (19) of Ω∗
ω in the second term the
factor N
1 appears and ﬁelds in integral are in fourth power. Therefore
after the renormalization (21) the ﬁelds in the integral are divided by N
1.
The procedure of the mean ﬁeld approximation (Hartree) is correct only for
large N. It means that the second term in (19) can be omitted and one thus
obtains

The interaction between photons results as the Kerr type nonlinearity of
the medium (27). Such type of nonlinearity is required to obtain (in parax-
ial and slowly varying envelop approximation) soliton solutions of Maxwell
equations [13]. In the view of the above results the soliton can be treated as
a bound state (cluster) of many photons. This is the attracting interaction
between photons, which can counteract spreading (because of dispersion or
diﬀraction) of the wave packet.

3 Summary

The inﬂuence of the medium on photon can be described by some scalar
potentials. This approach can be easily extended to the case of many in-
teracting photons. Taking the simplest model of such interaction (via delta-
potential) in Hartree approximation one obtains Kerr type nonlinearity of
the medium. One may say that optically nonlinear material it is the ma-
terial that enables interaction between photons. This result suggests that
optical solitons are nothing else but clusters of interacting photons. In such
a cluster the attraction between photons counteracts dispersion or diﬀrac-
tion. This is a similar point of view to that presented in [14] where solitons
of magnetization in magnetics were described as clusters of interacting (via
delta-potential) magnons.

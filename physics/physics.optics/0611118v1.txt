By using the notion of wavelength- and angle-averaged reﬂectance, we assess
in a systematic way the performance of ﬁnite omnidirectional reﬂectors. We
put forward how this concept can be employed to optimize omnidirectional
capabilities. We also apply it to give an alternate meaningful characterization
of the bandwidth of these systems.

Floquet-Bloch theory warrants that the behavior of pe-
riodically stratiﬁed media is determined by the trace of
the transfer matrix of the basic period. Indeed, whenever
the magnitude of this trace is greater than 2, no waves
propagate in the structure and then a stop band appears.
In the context of electromagnetic optics, this no-
tion is at the basis of photonic crystals1 (that is, one-
dimensional periodic layered structures), which have
been attracting a lot of attention because of their
amazing property of acting as omnidirectional reﬂectors
(ODRs): they reﬂect light at any polarization, any inci-
dence angle, and over a wide range of wavelengths2,3,4,5,6.
Although there are a number of approaches for ensur-
ing a trace greater than 2 in the basic period7,8,9,10,11, the
most feasible design involves two materials with refrac-
tive indices as diﬀerent as possible. Such a bilayer system
is usually designed at quarter-wave thickness (at normal
incidence), which is enough to guarantee ODR12,13,14.
However, this assumes perfect periodicity and so requires
the system to be strictly inﬁnite. Of course, this is
unattainable in practice and one is led to consider stacks
of N periods, which are often appropriately called ﬁnite
periodic structures15. One can rightly argue that when
N is high enough (say, 50 or more), there should be no
noticeable diﬀerences with the ideal inﬁnite case16. But
there are commercial ODR designs considering only very
few periods17 and, in such a situation, the optimization
of the basic period deserves a careful and in-depth study.
To shed light on this issue it is essential to quantify the
ODR performance in a manner that permits unambigu-
ous comparison between diﬀerent structures. We hold to
previous suggestions18,19, but to take into due consider-
ation the key role of the bandwidth, we propose here to
average the reﬂectance over all the incidence angles and
all the wavelengths in the spectral range. With this tool
at hand, we revisit ﬁnite ODRs and characterize their
properties, addressing, as a side product, a proper pic-
ture of the omnidirectional bandwidth for these systems.
We begin by brieﬂy recalling some background con-

cepts. The basic period of the ﬁnite ODR consists of
a double layer made of materials with refractive indices
(nL, nH) and thicknesses (dL, dH ), respectively. The ma-
terial L has a low refractive index, while H is of a high
refractive index. To characterize the optical response we
employ the transfer matrix, which can be computed as
M = ML MH , where ML and MH are the transfer matri-
ces of each layer, whose standard form can be found in
any textbook20.

As we have mentioned before, band gaps appear when-

ever the trace of the basic period satisﬁes

| Tr(M)| ≥ 2 .

(1)

This condition should be worked out for both basic po-
larizations. However, it is known that whenever Eq. (1)
is fulﬁlled for p polarization, it is always true also for
s polarization. The p-polarization bands are more strin-
gent than the corresponding s-polarization ones21 and we
thus restrict our study to the former.

We next consider an N -period structure whose basic
cell is precisely the bilayer LH. We denote this as [LH]N
and its overall transfer matrix is simply MN , from which
calculating its reﬂectance R(N ) is straightforward. Ac-
cording to our previous discussion, we average over all
the incidence angles and all the wavelengths in the spec-
tral interval ∆λ = λmax − λmin of interest

and take this as an appropriate ﬁgure of merit to assess
the performance as an ODR. Once the materials have
been chosen, R
is a function exclusively of the layer
thicknesses.

(N )

As a case study, we take the materials to be cryolite
(Na3AlF6) and zinc selenide (ZnSe), with refractive in-
dices nL = 1.34 and nH = 2.568, respectively, at the
wavelength λ = 0.65 µm. The spectral window consid-
ered is from λmin = 0.5 µm to λmax = 0.8 µm. In this

range, the refractive index of the cryolite can be con-
sidered, to a good approximation, as constant, while for
the zinc selenide we use the Sellmeier dispersion equation
n2
H (λ) = 4 + 1.9λ2/[λ2 − (0.336)2], where λ is expressed
in microns.

Many commercial packages are available to perform
layer optimization. In the case of ODR, common meth-
ods optimize a merit function that (quadratically) mea-
sures how the calculated reﬂectance separates from unity
(ideal target) at some deﬁnite angles and at some def-
inite wavelengths. For example, TFCALC uses needle
optimization to ﬁnd the best thicknesses for such a merit
function. We have preferred, however, to implement a
gradient-based modiﬁed quasi-Newton algorithm (using
the Fortran NAG libraries), for its consistency with the
problem investigated, which is continuous.

(N )

We have optimized the system [LH]N for N running
from 5 to 20. When the thicknesses are kept equal
by pairs, so as the structure retains its periodicity, we
ﬁnd thicknesses distributed around dL ≃ 145 nm and
dH ≃ 60 nm. The variation of R
with N is shown
in Fig. 1, and can be numerically ﬁtted to R
=
0.774 + 0.365 × 10−3 N ; i.e., a linear dependence with an
extremely small slope. We have also worked out the in-
stance when all the thicknesses may vary independently
(though now the system is not strictly periodic). The
optimum thicknesses oscillate a lot, without a deﬁnite
pattern (we do not list all of these values because of
(N )

space limitation). However, as is clear from Fig. 1, R
shows an exponential increasing that can be suitably rep-
resented by R

= 0.625 + 0.369[1 − exp(−0.132N )].

To gain further insights into these striking diﬀerences,
in Fig. 2 we have plotted the reﬂectance R(20) for the

a function of the incidence angle θ (in degrees) and the
wavelength λ (in µm). In a) we have the [LH]20 system,
while in b) the thicknesses are allowed to be diﬀerent.
At the bottom plane, we show the contour plots corre-
sponding to a reﬂectance 0.99. The white lines delimit
the zones in which this reﬂectance is greater than 0.99
for all the angles of incidence.

optimum thicknesses22 corresponding to N = 20 as a
function of the angle of incidence θ and the wavelength λ.
At the bottom plane we have also included the contours
of the regions where this reﬂectance is greater than 0.99.
While for the [LH]20 system, the top zone looks quite ﬂat
and very close to unity, the dips are very deep indeed. On
the contrary, when we allow for diﬀerent thicknesses, the
top zone presents small ripples, but the dips are much
less pronounced. Curiously enough, the [LH]20 system
gives a wider region lying above the 0.99 level. We have
also marked two stripes (within parallel lines) in which
the reﬂectance is greater than 0.99 for all the angles of
incidence (and that, roughly speaking, could be identiﬁed
with stop bands). Although of similar extension, they lie
in quite diﬀerent spectral ranges. We have repeated these
calculations with other values of N , observing essentially
the same kind of behavior.

To proceed further, in Fig. 3 we have represented the
angle-averaged reﬂectance [i.e., the magnitude in paren-
theses in Eq. (2)] for the same two systems as in Fig. 2, in
terms of the wavelength λ. Obviously, the area under the
curve is precisely R
. It is clear that for diﬀerent thick-
nesses, this area is considerably bigger (so, it is really an
optimum), while the [LH]20 is better behaved in a nar-
row range going from 0.57 µm to around 0.62 µm (which
matches well with the stop band shown in Fig. 2.a). In
other words, the optimum system remarkably improves

the behavior in the spectral wings, while it little aﬀects
(or even deteriorates) the behavior in the “good” central
region. The ripples in both curves are caused by the dips
appearing in Fig. 2 for each line of λ constant.

In this respect, we wish to note that, in our opinion,
the notion of bandwidth becomes fuzzy for ODRs. Usu-
ally20, it is deﬁned as δλ = λ+ − λ− [and sometimes12
normalized to the central wavelength (λ++λ−)/2], where
λ+ and λ− are the longer- and shorter-wavelength edges
for given ODR bands [i.e., the two solutions of Eq. (1)].
This is meaningful in the limit N → ∞, when these
band edges make unambiguous sense, but fails for our
more realistic situation. Other authors23 note that the
common reﬂecting band for both polarizations and for
angles up to a given θM (which is deﬁned by conven-
tion) is [λ−(θM), λ+(0)] and the corresponding band-
width δλ = λ+(0) − λ−(θM). Again, this kind of deﬁ-
nition assumes the existence of a full band, which is only
true for the strictly periodic case.

We emphasize that all the relevant information about
omnidirectionality is contained in the angle-averaged re-
ﬂectance. Furthermore, being an integral estimator, it
does not rely on the values of the reﬂectance at some spe-
ciﬁc relevant angles. For this reason, a sensible choice for
deﬁning the bandwidth is precisely the spectral range(s)
for which this angle-averaged reﬂectance is bigger than a
ﬁxed threshold value. For example, if we set this value
to, say 0.95, it is evident in Fig. 3 that the bandwidth
for the [LH]20 system is always poor.

To sum up in a few words, we have exploited the no-
tion of wavelength- and angle-averaged reﬂectance to ex-
plore in a systematic way the performance of ﬁnite ODRs.
Needless to say, our approach is general and can be ap-

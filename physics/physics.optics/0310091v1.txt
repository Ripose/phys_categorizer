The ﬁrst direct measurement of the geometric phase acquired by the light beams carrying

orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been reported by Galvez et al [1]. The closed path

traversed by the optical beams is the space of modes of Laguerre-Gaussian beams [2]. Modes

p carry OAM of l¯h per photon, where l is the azimuthal index, and p is the radial

LGl
index. In the experiments, a geometric phase on a LG−1
interfered with a reference LG0

0 beam. Authors conclude the paper with the statements:

0 beam is introduced, changed, and

”All of these geometric phases arose from transformations involving a change in the OAM of

the modes. They support the conjecture that geometric phase arises from the exchange of

angular momentum between the light and optical system [13]”. Ref.13 in [1] is an interesting

work by van Enk,here after referred at [3]. In the present note I make following comments:

A1. The connection of angular momentum to the geometrical phase in optics was vaguely

hinted at in [4]. In 1992 plausible arguments were presented to propose that the phys-

ical mechanism of geometrical phase in optics was the transfer of angular momentum

between the light and optical elements [5]. This conjecture was theoretically supported

by van Enk [3] ,and later by Banerjee [6]. In [3] van Enk considered LG beams for the

geometric phases.

A2. In 1994, LeFloch showed interest to verify this conjecture in his laboratory, however

the extreme diﬃculty in the measurement of angular momentum transfer was pointed

out by him [7]. The present work measures geometric phase, and is signiﬁcant; however

the direct demonstration of angular momentum exchange remains elusive. I believe

a direct experimental veriﬁcation of this relationship, and measurement of angular

momentum exchange would have far reaching implications on the nature of light and

crystal optics [8].

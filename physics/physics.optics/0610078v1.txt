We report on tunable terahertz resonant detection of two 1.55 µm cw-lasers beating by plasma
waves in AlGaAs/InGaAs/InP high-electron-mobility transistor. We show that the fundamental
plasma resonant frequency and its odd harmonics can be tuned with the applied gate-voltage in
the range 75–490 GHz. The observed frequency dependence on gate-bias is found to be in good
agreement with the theoretical plasma waves dispersion law.

Operating optic-to-electronic data conversion at the
terahertz (THz) frequency range is one of the most
promising issue of optoelectronic devices. Recently, ex-
perimental studies on the plasma resonant detection in
high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) and in a sin-
gle and a double quantum well ﬁeld eﬀect transistors
(FETs) have been published [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. For submi-
cron gate-lengths, fundamental plasma frequencies reach
the THz range [7]. THz detection by plasma waves is
easily tunable by changing the gate-voltage. Spectral
proﬁles of THz plasma waves resonances were ﬁrst re-
ported by T. Otsuji et al., the HEMT being excited by
means of interband photoexcitation using the diﬀerence-
frequency component of a photomixed laser beam [8].
With a similar experiment, we investigate in this letter
the plasma waves resonances excited in the channel of
HEMTs by the beating of two cw-lasers. We show that
the plasma resonant frequencies follow the square-root
dependence versus applied gate-voltage as initiallypre-
dicted by Dyakonov-Shur theory [7].

FIG. 1:
Transfer characteristics of AlGaAs/InGaAs/InP
HEMT. Lg = 800 nm and Vth = −150 mV. Inset (a) : output
characteristics at T = 300 K for Vg = +0.1 V, 0 V, -0.1 V
and -0.2 V. Inset (b) : schematic of the InGaAs HEMT with
the incoming photomixed laser beam by the rear facet.

The whole HEMT structure is transparent to the in-
cident radiation excepted the InGaAs-channel where the
interband photoexcitation occurs. By using a tunable
optical beating this photoexcitation is modulated over
a large frequency range. Two commercially-available
cw-lasers sources centered at λ1 = 1543 nm and λ2 =
1545 nm are used. Each powerful laser (≈ 20 mW) can
be tuned over a range of ≈ ± 1 nm by varying the
temperature. Their mixing produces a tunable optical
beating from 0 to 600 GHz. The collimated beams are
mechanically chopped at 120 Hz and focused onto the

where v0 is the electron drift velocity, m∗ is the elec-
tron eﬀective mass, µ = 13000 cm2 V−1 s−1. With
increase of the drain-source voltage, the electron drift
velocity increases leading to the increase of τeﬀ . When
ω0τeﬀ becomes on the order of unity, the detection be-
comes resonant; ω0 being the fundamental plasma pul-
sation. The quality factor experimentally obtained from
the linewidth [full width at half maximum (FWHM)] of
the resonance for V0 = 65 mV is Q = ω0τeﬀ ≈ 1.2. This
value is in good agreement with the calculated values
of ω0τeﬀ ≈ 1 obtained taking into account the electron
drift velocity v0 ≈ 8 105 m.s−1 according to Monte Carlo
simulation [11].
In order to determine the theoretical
spectral response of plasma waves resonances, the exper-
imental data are compared to the model developed by
V. Ryzhii et al.
[12] on the plasma mechanism of tera-
hertz photomixing in HEMTs (solid lines in Fig. 2). The

where ~Ω/e = 0.8 V in accordance with the incoming
radiation wavelengths of λ1 ≈ λ2 ≈ 1.55 µm, ηω de-
termine the excitation of the plasma oscillations by the
photogenerated carriers and βω is the wavevector of the
plasma waves given by

HEMT backside using an objective lens (spot size diam-
eter ≈ 5 µm). The photoconductivity response, due to
the diﬀerence frequency generation, is obtained by moni-
toring the modulation of the dc drain-to-source potential.
Figure 2 shows the photoconductive response versus
excitation frequency at room temperature. The photore-
sponse intensity normalized to unity is plotted versus
the excitation frequency ∆f . Upper and lower panel of
(Fig. 2) show the room temperature photoconductive
response at V0 = 65 mV and at V0 = 14 mV respec-
tively. To discriminate the plasma resonant eﬀect from
the background, the photoconductive response under
a zero-∆f-condition was also measured and subtracted
from original data. At V0 = 65 mV, two peaks are
clearly observed and indicated by arrows. These peaks
correspond to the plasma resonance at fundamental fre-
quency (f0 ≈ 160 GHz) and third harmonic frequency
(3f0 ≈ 490 GHz). Like in [8] the peak intensity at 490
GHz is slightly stronger than that at 160 GHz. At V0 =
14 mV, the fundamental (f0 ≈ 75 GHz), third harmonic
(3f0 ≈ 250 GHz) and ﬁfth harmonic (5f0 ≈ 400 GHz)
plasma frequency peak are observed. The drain is biased
at Vd = 100 mV. According to the theory devellopped
in [9], an accurate description of the resonance response
of HEMTs for Vd 6= 0 implies the replacement of the
momentum relaxation time τ = µm∗/e by an eﬀective
momentum relaxation time τeﬀ given in [10]

s being the plasma waves velocity and ν the collision
frequency of carriers in the absorption layer (ν =
1.5 1011 s−1). As given in [12], ηω is a function of the
carrier relaxation times τeﬀ and of the beating pulsation
ω. As a result, the FWHM of the plasma waves reso-
nances obtained by the calculation with ω0τeﬀ = 1 agree
well with experimental data which are spectrally broaden
because of the lower quality factor of the THz “cavity”.
The calculated resonant frequencies of the plasma waves
obtained from this model are seen in good accordance
with experiments in Fig. 2.
It should be emphasized
that these calculated results are obtained without any
adjustable parameter. Only InGaAs material parame-
ters such as electron eﬀective mass (m∗ = 0.041 m0)
and HEMT parameters (Lg, τeﬀ ) have been introduced in
the calculation. A small discrepancy between model and
experiments deals with the photoresponse peak ampli-
tudes. They are nearly constant in experiments, whereas
they are expected to decrease in the model when ∆f
increases. A possible explanation is that the model cal-
culate the HEMT responsivity from the ac gate-channel
current while we experimentally monitored the dc drain-
source voltage. The transfer function between both being
the Id–Vd characteristic of the HEMT that is spectrally
dependent.

The frequency dependence of the plasma waves is plot-
ted in Fig. 3 versus the swing-voltage. The experimental
data for the fundamental frequency and its odd harmon-
ics are obtained by picking-up the frequency position of

where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , and Lg = 800 nm. Theoretical
calculations well support experimental datas for funda-
mental plasma waves frequency and its odd harmonics.

In conclusion, the excitation of plasma waves in Al-
GaAs/InGaAs/InP HEMT channel was performed at
room temperature by using a pair of commercially avail-
able cw-lasers delivering a THz optical beating. We
show that the fundamental plasma resonant frequency
and its odd harmonics can be tuned with the applied
gate-voltage in the range 75–490 GHz and follow the pre-
dicted square-root behaviour. A good quantitative agree-
ment between experiments and Dyakonov-Shur theory is
obtained.

Future works will involved shorter gate-length devices
to reach higher plasma frequencies thus allowing ultra-
high optoelectronic data conversion.

Dielectric optical micro-resonators and micro-lasers represent a realization of a wave-chaotic sys-
tem, where the lack of symmetry in the resonator shape leads to non-integrable ray dynamics.
Modes of such resonators display a rich spatial structure, and cannot be classiﬁed through mode
indices which would require additional constants of motion in the ray dynamics. Understanding and
controlling the emission properties of such resonators requires the investigation of the correspon-
dence between classical phase space structures of the ray motion inside the resonator and resonant
solutions of the wave equations. We ﬁrst discuss the breakdown of the conventional eikonal approx-
imation in the short wavelength limit, and motivate the use of phase-space ray tracing and phase
space distributions. Next, we introduce an eﬃcient numerical method to calculate the quasi-bound
modes of dielectric resonators, which requires only two diagonalizations per N states, where N is
approximately equal to the number of half-wavelengths along the perimeter. The relationship be-
tween classical phase space structures and modes is displayed via the Husimi projection technique.
Observables related to the emission pattern of the resonator are calculated with high eﬃciency.

INTRODUCTION

A promising approach to making compact and high-Q optical resonators is to base them on “totally internally
reﬂected” modes of dielectric micro-structures. Such devices have received considerable attention as versatile com-
ponents for integrated optics and for low threshold micron-scale semiconductor lasers[9, 68]. The interest in such
resonators for applications and for fundamental optical physics has motivated the extension of optical resonator
theory to describe such systems.

All optical resonators are open systems described by modes characterized by both a central frequency and a width
(their ratio giving the Q-factor of the mode). In a mirror-based resonator the set of resonant frequencies is determined
by an optical path-length for one round-trip along a path determined by the mirrors within the resonator; the width
is determined by the reﬂectivity of the mirrors, diﬀraction at the mirror edges and by absorption loss within the
resonator. Accurate analytic formulas can be found for the resonator frequencies and for the electric ﬁeld distribution
of each mode using the methods of Gaussian optics[62]. The modes are characterized by one longitudinal and
two transverse mode indices (in three dimensions). These mode indices play the same role mathematically for the
electromagnetic wave equation as the good quantum numbers play in characterizing solutions of the wave equation of
quantum mechanics.

For fabricating optical resonators on the micron scale, using total internal reﬂection from a dielectric interface for
optical conﬁnement is convenient as it simpliﬁes the process. Such dielectric resonators deﬁne no speciﬁc optical path
length; many diﬀerent and potentially non-closed ray trajectories can be conﬁned within the resonator. An important
point, emphasized in the current work, is that in such resonators there typically exist many narrow resonances
characterized by their frequency and width, but such resonances often cannot be characterized by any further modes
indices. This is the analog of a quantum system in which there are no good quantum numbers except for the energy.
We shall see that the way to determine if a given mode has additional mode indices (other than the frequency), is
to determine whether it corresponds to regular or chaotic ray motion. We will present below an eﬃcient numerical
method for calculating all of the resonances of a large class of dielectric resonators; we will also describe the surface
of section and Husimi-Wigner projection method to determine the ray dynamics corresponding to such a mode.

Although both DBR-based and edge-emitting optical resonators rely on reﬂectivity from a dielectric interface (at
normal incidence), we will use the term dielectric resonator (DR) to refer to resonators that rely on the high reﬂectivity
of dielectric bodies to radiation incident from within the dielectric near the critical angle for total internal reﬂection.
This is the only class of resonators we will treat below. We immediately point out that totally-internally-reﬂected
solutions of the wave equation only exist for inﬁnite ﬂat dielectric interfaces; any curvature or ﬁnite extent of the
dielectric will allow evanescent leakage of propagating radiation from the optically more dense to the less dense
medium. As a dielectric resonator is a ﬁnite dielectric body embedded in air (or in a lower index medium) it will of
necessity allow some evanescent leakage of all modes, even those which from ray analysis appear to be totally-internally
reﬂected.

A very large range of shapes for DRs have been studied during the recent years. By far the most widely studied are

2

rotationally symmetric structures such as spheres, cylinders and disks. The reason for this is that the wave equation
is separable and the solutions can be written in terms of special functions carrying three modes indices. The narrow
(long-lived) resonances correspond to ray trajectories circling around the symmetry axis near the boundary with angle
of incidence above total internal reﬂection; these solutions are often referred to as “whispering gallery” (WG) modes
or morphology-dependent resonances. In this case, due to the separability of the problem, it is straightforward to
evaluate the violation of total internal reﬂection, which may be interpreted as the tunneling of waves through the
angular momentum barrier[33, 48]. Micron-scale, high-Q micro-lasers were fabricated in mid-80s and early 90s based

However, the very high Q value makes these resonators unsuitable for micro-laser applications, because such lasers
invariably provide low-output power and furthermore, unless additional guiding elements are used, the lasing output

As early as 1994[50] one of the current authors proposed to study dielectric resonators based on smooth deformations
of cylinders or spheres which were referred to as “asymmetric resonant cavities” (ARCs). The idea was to attempt
to combine the high Q provided by near total internal reﬂection with a breaking of rotational symmetry leading to
directional emission and improved output coupling. General principles of non-linear dynamics applied to the ray
motion (to be reviewed below) suggested that there would be only a gradual degradation of the high-Q modes, and
one might be able to obtain directional emission from deformed whispering gallery modes. Experimental[10, 46, 51]
and theoretical[49] work since that initial suggestion has conﬁrmed this idea, although the important modes are not
always of the whispering gallery type[21, 22, 23, 40, 59].

Calculating the modal properties of deformed cylindrical and spherical resonators presents a much more challenging
theoretical problem. Unless the boundary of the resonator corresponds to a constant coordinate surface of some or-
thogonal coordinate system, the resulting partial diﬀerential equation will not be solvable by separation of variables.
The only relevant separable case is an exactly elliptical deformation of the boundary, which turns out to be unrepre-
sentative of generic smooth deformations. Using perturbation theory to evaluate the new modes based on those of the
cylindrical or spherical case is also impractical, as for interesting deformations and typical resonator dimensions (tens
of microns or larger) the eﬀect of the deformation is too large for the modes of interest to be treated by perturbation
theory. The small parameter in the problem for attempting approximate solutions is the ratio of the wavelength
to the perimeter λ/2πR = (kR)−1. Eikonal methods[38] and Gaussian optical methods[62] both rely on the short
wavelength limit to ﬁnd approximate solutions. The Gaussian optical method can be used to ﬁnd a subset of the
solutions for generic ARCs, those associated with stable periodic ray orbits, as explained in detail in Ref.[65]. The
eikonal method can also be used to ﬁnd a subset of the modes of ARCs, if one has a good approximate expression for
a local constant of motion; an example of this is the adiabatic approximation used by N¨ockel and Stone[49]. However
a large fraction of the modes in ARCs are not describable by either of these methods. The breakdown of the Gaussian
optical methods is easily seen as a fully chaotic system will have only unstable periodic orbits and the solutions one
obtains by the Gaussian method near unstable periodic ray orbits are inconsistent[65]. The failure of eikonal methods
is more subtle and really arises from the possibility of chaotic ray motion in a ﬁnite fraction of the phase space.
Often optics textbooks and even standard research references treat the eikonal method as being of completely general
applicability; we therefore will devote the next section of this paper to an explanation of the failure of eikonal methods
for resonators with arbitrary smooth boundaries. In section (III) we describe the phase space methods which indicate
that this failure is generic.

In section (IV) we present the formulation of the resonance problem and in section (V) the reduction of the Maxwell’s
equations to the Helmholtz Equation for the resonators we study. The failure of all standard short wavelength
approximation methods to describe the solution of wave equations in ﬁnite domains with arbitrary smooth boundaries
has led to the problem of “quantizing chaos” in the context of the Schr¨odinger equation and the Helmholtz Equation
(although our problem is somewhat diﬀerent due to the dielectric boundary conditions on this equation). Although
substantial progress has been made using periodic orbit methods in obtaining approximations for the density of states

great importance in this ﬁeld to develop eﬃcient numerical methods which can be used to calculate and interpret
the resonance properties. In section (VI) we present a highly eﬃcient numerical method for ARCs, adapted from the
S-matrix methods developed in the ﬁeld of quantum chaos. In section (VII) we display a range of resonant solutions
for a partially chaotic dielectric resonator and in section (VIII) we show how to perform the Husimi projection of the
real-space numerical solutions so obtained into phase space in order to interpret them in terms of ray dynamics. The
calculation of experimental observable relating to emission patterns from micro-lasers are discussed in section (IX).
Finally, in section (X), we show examples of the main types of modes one encounters in wave-chaotic dielectric
resonators generally and speciﬁcally in ARCs.

II. FAILURE OF EIKONAL METHODS FOR GENERIC DIELECTRIC RESONATORS

The use of classical ray theory to describe monochromatic, high-frequency solutions of the wave equation is described
in various references[4, 35, 38]. The connection between rays and waves is standardly derived in the context of the
Helmholtz equation

the wave equation for the resonator problem will be reduced to this equation in section (V). The eikonal approach

Note at this point we only assume one eikonal S(x) and one amplitude A(x) at each order in the expansion. We will
also specialize to a uniform medium of dielectric constant n. In this framework, each wave solution ψ(x) corresponds
to a family of rays deﬁned by the vector ﬁeld

where the ﬁeld has a ﬁxed magnitude,
: x = x(s) and propagating the curve using the eikonal
of initial value boundary conditions on an open curve
equation. Such an initial value solution can thus be extended until it encounters a point at which two or more distinct
rays of the wavefront converge; at or nearby such a point will occur a focus or caustic at which the amplitude A will
diverge and in the neighborhood of which the asymptotic representation becomes ill-deﬁned. (A caustic is a curve to
which all the rays of a wavefront are tangent; if the curve degenerates to a point it is a focus[38]). This causes only
a local breakdown of the method and can be handled by a number of methods. At a distance much greater than a
wavelength away from the caustic the solutions are still a good approximation to the true solution of the initial value
problem.

C

In contrast, to ﬁnd asymptotic solutions on a bounded domain D with boundary value conditions, one must
introduce more than one eikonal at each order in the asymptotic expansion. We will illustrate the important points
here with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary ∂D. However the basic argument holds for any linear
homogeneous boundary conditions and, with minor modiﬁcations, for the matching conditions relevant for uniform
dielectric resonators of index of refraction n with boundary shape ∂D, within an inﬁnite medium of index n = 1. For
the discussion of Dirichlet boundary conditions we will set the index n = 1 for convenience within the domain D. The
leading order in the asymptotic expansion of the solution takes the form

ψ(x) =

with N
2. It is easily checked that there must be more than one term (eikonal) in the solution in order to have a
non-trivial solution; if there were only one term in the expression for ψ(x) then any solution which vanished on the
boundary would vanish identically in D due to the form of the transport equation.

≥

The question we now address is the following. For what boundary shapes ∂D in two dimensions do there exist
approximate solutions of the form Eq. (6) which are valid everywhere in D except in the neighborhood of caustics
(which are a set of measure zero)?

First we note that with Dirichlet boundary conditions we have a hermitian eigenvalue problem and so we know that
solutions will only exist at a discrete set of real wavevectors k. In the eikonal theory the quantization condition for k
arises from the requirement of single-valuedness of ψ(x) and will be reviewed brieﬂy below. Here our primary goal is
to show that the existence of eikonal solutions to the boundary value problem is intimately tied to the nature of the

ray dynamics within the region D. Moreover for the case of fully chaotic ray dynamics this connection shows that
eikonal solutions do not exist. We will prove this latter statement by showing a contradiction follows from assuming
the existence of eikonal solutions in the chaotic case. This argument will be a “physicist’s proof” without excessive
attention to full mathematical rigor.

terms are balanced at each order in k the functions Sn cannot vary too rapidly in space. From the eikonal equation

Sm for some m in Eq. (7). A
ray moving linearly in a domain D and specularly reﬂecting from the boundary describes exactly the same dynamics
as a point mass moving on a frictionless “billiard” table with boundary walls of shape ∂D. Such dynamical billiards
have been studied since Birkhoﬀ in the 1920’s as simple dynamical systems which can and typically do exhibit chaotic
motion. Thus the problem of predicting the properties of the vector ﬁelds Sm is identical to the problem of the
long-time behavior of dynamical billiards.

One property of any such bounded dynamical system (independent of whether it displays chaos) is that any

trajectory starting from a point x0 will return to a neighborhood of that point an inﬁnite number of times as t

(the Poincar´e recurrence theorem[53]). Therefore we are guaranteed that the ray we followed from x0 in the direction
ˆp1 will eventually re-enter the neighborhood of size λ around x0. By our previous argument, each linear segment of

the ray trajectory, corresponds to one of the directions

which category of ray motion occurs.

Let us ﬁrst consider a billiard ∂D with fully chaotic dynamics. In the current context “fully chaotic” means that
for arbitrary choice of x0 and the direction ˆp1 (except for sets of measure zero, such as unstable periodic orbits) the
distribution of return directions (momenta) is continuous and isotropic as t
. Therefore the number of terms
in an eikonal solution of the form Eq. (6) would have to be inﬁnite, contradicting our initial assumption that N
was ﬁnite. Thus there do not exist eikonal solutions with ﬁnite N for wave equations on domains with fully chaotic
ray dynamics. A very closely related point was made by Einstein as early as 1917[18] (he phrased it as the non-
existence of a multi-valued vector ﬁeld deﬁned by the N “sheets” of the functions Sm). One may ask whether an
eikonal solution with an inﬁnite number of terms could be deﬁned; this appears unlikely as the amplitudes for the
wavefronts are bounded below by (λ/L)1/2, where L is the typical linear dimension of D, so that only a very special
phase relationship between terms would allow such a sum to converge. The essential physics of this breakdown of the
eikonal method is that in a chaotic system wave solutions exist but do not have wavefronts which are straight on a
scale much larger than a wavelength, hence it is impossible to develop a sensible asymptotic expansion with smooth
functions Sm.

Returning now to the case of a boundary ∂D for which the distribution of return momenta is always discrete, this
means that there exist exactly N ray directions for each point x0 and any choice of ˆp1. In this case the entire spectrum
of the wave equation on ∂D can be obtained by an eikonal approximation with N terms of the form Eq. (6). The
quantized values of k are determined by the conditions that the eikonal only advance in phase by an integer multiple
2π upon each return to x0 and hence the solution is single-valued. The correct quantization condition must take into
account phase shifts which occurs for rays as they pass caustics. The details of implementing this condition have
become know as Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization[36].

From modern studies of billiard dynamics we know that both of the cases we have just considered are exceptional.
The billiards for which eikonal solutions for the entire spectrum is possible are called integrable, and their ray
dynamics has one global constant of motion for each degree of freedom. For example in the circular billiard both
angular momentum and energy are conserved and for each choice of x0 and direction ˆp1 there are exactly two
return directions[36] (see Fig. 1). While the circle is a good and relevant example here, there are other shapes,
such as rectangles and equilateral triangles for which the method also works; obviously these are shapes of very high
symmetry. It is also known that an elliptical billiard of any eccentricity is integrable; however this is believed to be
the only integrable smooth deformation of a circle[2, 54]. Thus there is a relatively small class of boundaries for which
eikonal methods work globally; this point does not seem to be widely appreciated in the optics community.

x0 and initial direction ˆp1 are shown in red. (b) The Bunimovich stadium, consisting of two semi-circles connected by straight
segments, for which ray motion is completely chaotic. As the schematic indicates, for any point x0 the ray return directions
are inﬁnite, continuously distributed and isotropic, making an eikonal solution impossible.

As already noted, the type of boundary shape which generates continuous return distributions for each choice of x0
and direction ˆp1 correspond to completely chaotic billiards and such shapes are also quite rare. No smooth boundary
(i.e. ∂D for which all derivatives exist) is known to be of this type. A well-known and relevant example for us of such
a shape is the stadium billiard, consisting of two semi-circular “endcaps” connected by straight sides. Note that the
generation of continuous return distributions would fail for a point x0 between the two straight walls if we chose ˆp1
perpendicular to the walls generating a (marginally stable) two-bounce periodic orbit passing through x0. However
this choice represents a set of measure zero of the initial conditions in the phase space. It follows from our above
arguments that eikonal methods would fail for the entire spectrum in such a billiard (except a set of measure zero in
the short wavelength limit).

The generic dynamics of billiards arises when the boundary is smooth but there is not a second global constant of
motion; this is exempliﬁed by the quadrupole billiard we study extensively below (see deﬁnition in Eq. (8)). Such a
billiard has “mixed” dynamics; we shall explain what this means and how it is studied in more detail below. For such
a billiard, depending on the choice of the initial phase space point (x0, ˆp1), one may get either a ﬁnite number N of
return directions or an inﬁnite number as t
. It is not obvious just from our above arguments that this means
that eikonal methods will fail in such a case. We will skip over this point and simply state that in the case of mixed
dynamics in principle only a ﬁnite fraction of the spectrum could be calculated by eikonal methods. If one can obtain
a relatively tractable expression for the locally-conserved quantity which leads to a ﬁnite number of return directions
N , as in the adiabatic approximation of Berry and Robnik[60], then some progress can be made[49]. However in
Sm required are usually too complicated to make such an approach tractable. Thus in
practice the vector ﬁelds

practice eikonal methods are not very useful to ﬁnd solutions of the Helmholtz equation for generic shapes. A related
but diﬀerent analytic method, that of Gaussian optics, can be used to calculate a fraction of the spectrum based on
motion near stable periodic orbits. This method is worked out for dielectric billiards with mixed dynamics in detail
in Ref.[65]. However both this and the eikonal method fail for a fraction of the spectrum which approaches unity as
the chaotic fraction of phase space approaches unity.

Since the traditional analytic methods of optics fail for these systems, what other short wavelength approaches
exist? The development of short wavelength approximations for mixed and chaotic systems is precisely the problem
of quantum chaos which has been widely studied in atomic, nuclear, solid-state and mathematical physics over the
past two decades[7, 20, 25, 26]. Powerful analytic methods have been developed, but with an essentially diﬀerent
character than eikonal or Gaussian methods (these techniques are typically referred to as semiclassical methods in
the quantum chaos literature). The analytic methods in quantum chaos theory are all of a statistical character and
do not allow one to calculate individual modes. Instead the methods focus on the ﬂuctuating part of the density of
modes and the statistical properties of the spectrum (e.g. level-spacing distributions). The results are useful in many
contexts, but less useful in the context of optical resonators and micro-lasers for which a single or small set of modes
will be selected and one is interested in their emission patterns and Q-values. Therefore it is particularly important
to develop eﬃcient numerical methods for calculating the spectrum and modes of such dielectric resonators, and we
will discuss our method for doing this in section (VI) below.

We are primarily interested in ARC resonators with mixed billiard dynamics as these shapes lead to resonances with
high Q and directional emission. For such resonators, the ray phase space is not fully chaotic, but is highly structured.
. Therefore using
Moreover the possibility of ray escape decreases the randomizing eﬀect of chaotic motion at t
methods which maintain a connection between the wave solutions and the ray phase space is very helpful. We shall
describe such a method, known as Husimi projection, in section (VIII) below.

III. RAY DYNAMICS FOR GENERIC DIELECTRIC RESONATORS

Before introducing our numerical method and the Husimi projection method, we review the properties of mixed
phase space via the surface of section method in the context of the quadrupole billiard/ARC. This billiard is described
by the boundary shape:

R(φ) = R0(1 + ǫ cos 2φ)

(8)

which in the zero deformation limit ǫ = 0 reduces to a circular billiard, which as we have already noted, is integrable.
Therefore the variation of the parameter ǫ starting from zero induces a transition to chaos. As the perturbation is
smooth, various results in dynamical systems (collectively known as Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory) imply that
the transition to chaos is gradual[3, 39]. The quadrupole billiard displays the typical behavior characteristic of this
transition. In our initial discussion here we treat the ideal perfectly-reﬂecting billiard; later we will discuss the role
of ray escape in ARCs.

When the shape is gradually deformed, it quickly becomes unfeasible to capture the types of ensuing ray motion by
standard ray tracing methods in real space. A standard tool of non-linear dynamics, which proves to be very useful
in disentangling the dynamical information, is the Poincar´e surface of section (SOS)[43, 57]. In this two-dimensional
phase-space representation, the internal ray motion is conveniently parametrized by recording the pair of numbers
(φi, sin χi) at each reﬂection i, where φi is the polar angle denoting the position of the ith reﬂection on the boundary
and sin χi is the corresponding angle of incidence of the ray at that position (see Fig. 2). Each initial point is
then evolved in time through the iteration of the SOS map i
i + 1, resulting in basically two general classes of
distributions. If the iteration results in a one-dimensional distribution (an invariant curve), the motion represented
is regular. On the other hand exploration of a two-dimensional region is the signature of chaotic motion.

→

The transition to ray chaos in the quadrupole billiard is illustrated in Fig. 3. At zero deformation the conservation
of sin χ results in straight line trajectories throughout the SOS and we have globally regular motion. These are the
well-known whispering gallery (WG) orbits for sin χ > 1/n. As the deformation is increased (see Fig. 3) chaotic
motion appears (the areas of scattered points in Fig. 3) and a given initial condition explores a larger range of values
of sin χ. Simultaneously, islands of stable motion emerge (closed curves in Fig. 3), but there also exist extended
“KAM curves”[39] (open curves in Fig. 3), which describe a deformed WG-like motion close to the perimeter of the
boundary. These islands and KAM curves cannot be crossed by chaotic trajectories in the SOS. As the transition to
chaos ensues, a crucial role is played by the periodic orbits (POs), which appear as ﬁxed points of the SOS map. The
local structure of the islands and chaotic layers can be understood through the periodic orbits which they contain.
Thus, the center of each island contains a stable ﬁxed point, and close to each stable ﬁxed point the invariant curves
form a family of rotated ellipses. The Birkhoﬀ ﬁxed point theorem[43] guarantees that each stable ﬁxed point has an
unstable partner, which resides on the intersection of separatrix curves surrounding the elliptic manifolds. Chaotic

FIG. 2: The construction of the surface of section plot. Each reﬂection from the boundary is represented by a point in the SOS
recording the angular position of the bounce on the boundary (φ) and the angle of incidence with respect to the local outward
pointing normal (sin χ). For a standary dynamical billiard there is perfect specular reﬂection and no escape. For “dielectric
billiards” if sin χ > sin χc > 1/n, total internal reﬂection takes place, but both refraction and reﬂection according to Fresnel’s
law results when a bounce point (bounce #4 in the ﬁgure) falls below the “critical line” (shown in red) sin χ > sin χc. Note
that sin χ < 0 correspond to clockwise sense of circulation. We do not plot the sin χ < 0 region as the SOS has reﬂection
symmetry. Below we will plot the SOS for ideal billiards without escape unless we specify otherwise.

motion sets in at separatrix regions ﬁrst, and with increasing deformation pervades larger and larger regions of the
SOS. Already at ǫ = 0.1, much of the phase space is chaotic and a typical initial condition in the chaotic sea explores
a large range of sin χ, eventually reversing its sense of rotation.

IV. FORMULATION OF THE RESONANCE PROBLEM

A dielectric resonator is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the closed (Dirichlet) problem due to its openness. In contrast to
ideal metallic cavities which possess normal modes at discrete real frequencies, dielectric resonators are characterized
by a discrete set of quasi-bound modes[12, 41], or resonances. As a result, the quasi-bound modes of a resonator are
characterized by a frequency ω = ck and a lifetime τ , where c is the speed of light and k = 2π/λ is the wavevector
in vacuum. Experiments on resonators fall into two broad categories, and the presence of quasi-bound modes are
manifested diﬀerently in these two situations.

In scattering experiments, an incoming ﬁeld produced by a source in the farﬁeld (spatial inﬁnity) gives rise to an
outgoing ﬁeld which represents the response of the resonator, as measured by an ideal detector in the farﬁeld. In the
ideal case, where absorption is absent, this corresponds to a situation where energy is conserved and hence in this
situation the EM ﬁeld has a real frequency, ω, which is arbitrary and set by the source. In emission experiments, on the
other hand, there is no incoming ﬁeld, but only an outgoing ﬁeld. As a result, energy is depleted from the system, and
this process is characterized by decay. The simplest mathematical description of these two experiments correspond
to the solution of the wave-equation (which is derived from the Maxwell’s equations as described in section (V))

FIG. 3: The SOS of a quadrupole at fractional deformations ǫ = 0, 0.05, 0.11, 0.18. The closed curves and the curves crossing
the SOS represent two types of regular motion, motion near a stable periodic orbit and quasi-periodic motion respectively.
The regions of scattered points represent chaotic portions of phase space. A single trajectory in this “chaotic component” will
explore the entire chaotic region. With increasing deformation the chaotic component of the SOS (scattered points) grows with
respect to regular components and is already dominant at 11 % deformation. Note in (b) the separatrix region associated with
the two-bounce unstable orbit along the major axis where the transition to chaotic motion sets in ﬁrst.

and experimentally, it is the scattering matrix Sµν(k), which contains the information measured by the farﬁeld
detector. In the typical case Sµν(k) will display sharp peaks at a discrete set of real wavevectors ki (in case of isolated
resonances; see the back panel (Re [kR]-I plane) on Fig. 4). This is the signature of long-lived quasi-bound modes with
frequency ω = cki; their lifetimes τ are encoded in the functional form of the peaks, which in general is of Fano shape,
with direction-dependent parameters. This makes scattering boundary conditions less convenient for the extraction
of the quasi-bound mode structure.

This form at inﬁnity does not permit solution for any real k as it manifestly violates current conservation. Instead
the solutions of Eq. (11), indexed by i, exist only at discrete complex wavevectors ki = κi + iΓi. The connection to

quasi-bound modes is then direct; the real part gives the quasi-bound mode frequency ωi = cκi and the imaginary
part represents the lifetime of the mode, τi = 1/cΓi. Here, we will use the radiation boundary conditions exclusively,
and quote the dimensionless complex variable kR instead, where R is the mean radius of the resonator. In an active
medium, one may think of these resonances as being pulled up to real wave-vectors by the gain. Although the
description of actual (stationary) laser modes requires the solution of a non-linear wave-equation[64], we will focus
here on the problem of linear resonances, an approximation which is often used in laser theory[62].

FIG. 4: A comparison of scattering and emission pictures for quasi-bound modes. Variation of the intensity scattered oﬀ
a dielectric circular cylinder with the wavenumber k of an incoming plane-wave is plotted on the back panel (I − Re [kR]
plane). The intensity is observed at 170◦ with respect to the incoming wave direction; it would look signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in
another direction due to interference with the incident beam. The complex quasi-bound mode frequencies are plotted on the
Re [kR] − Im [kR] plane. Notice that the most prominent peaks in scattering intensity are found at the values of k where a
quasi-bound mode frequency is closest to the real-axis. These are the long-lived resonances of the cavity. Also visible is the
contribution of resonances with shorter lifetimes (higher values of Im [kR]) to broader peaks and the scattering background.

The relation between the linear emission and scattering picture is easily visualized in the extended complex wavevec-
tor space of the scattering matrix Sµν (k), depicted in Fig. 4. The discrete quasi-bound wavevectors ki are the poles
of Sµν (k). As can be seen from the ﬁgure, in general there are multiple quasi-bound modes contributing to a given
resonance peak, but the quasi-bound modes which are closest to the real-axis lead to the sharpest peaks (some of
which might not even be resolved in the scattering proﬁle). Note that via Eq. (10), the quasi-bound mode solutions
damp in time. An important experimental value often quoted is the Q-value of a resonator, which is deﬁned by the
number of cycles of the optical ﬁeld at frequency ω to decay to half of its value, and thus can be related to quasi-bound
mode parameters by the relation Q = ωτ =

It is possible to generalize eikonal theory to calculate the quasi-bound states of complex k of dielectric cavities
of integrable shape[64]. The dielectric boundary conditions then reduce to ray trajectories which still propagate on
straight lines and undergo specular reﬂection, much like in the case of billiards. The additional feature is that dielectric
billiards exhibit ray splitting at the boundary, and give rise to both a refracted and reﬂected ray with amplitude and
direction obtained from the application of the laws of Snell and Fresnel for a ﬂat dielectric boundary. The transport
equations for the amplitude have to be supplemented by an additional complex multiplicative factor at each encounter
with the boundary. The practical implication is that the ray motion as displayed on the SOS can be used for the
dielectric problem, when augmented with an escape condition. The escape probability will be exponentially small
−1 1/n, since its due to a tunneling-like
in wavenumber k for angles of incidence above the critical angle χc = sin
process[48, 64]. This condition is demarcated by the line sin χ = sin χc in the SOS; any ray falling below this line

providing a classical loss mechanism and leading to ﬁnite lifetimes of the corresponding modes. Thus the openness
of dielectric resonators is not the cause of the failure of standard methods; these methods fail for chaotic resonator
shapes for the same reasons of dynamical complexity discussed in section II for the Dirichlet case. We now discuss
the reduction of the wave equation for dielectric resonators to the Helmholtz equation to lay the groundwork for the
numerical method of section VI, which allows us to solve for the resonances of chaotic shapes.

V. REDUCTION OF MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS

Consider the problem of excitation of electromagnetic waves in an inﬁnite dielectric rod of arbitrary cross-section
(see schematics in Fig. 5), which is extended along the z-axis. In practical situations, the structure is of ﬁnite extent
and there are planar end-caps which makes it truly a resonator. In other cases, it’s a ﬁber-optic cable of practically
inﬁnite extent. In any case, we will for now assume translational symmetry along z-axis, and we will show later that
this is a perfectly valid assumption for the modes of relevance to us.

FIG. 5: Illustration of the reduction of the Maxwell equation for an inﬁnite dielectric rod of general cross-section to the 2D
Helmholtz equation for the TM case (E ﬁeld parallel to axis) and kk = kz = 0.

Assuming harmonic time-dependence of the ﬁelds and no surface currents and charges, Maxwell’s equations for the

system yield the Helmholtz equations:

where k = 2π/λ = ω/c is the wavevector in vacuum; n = √µǫ is the index of refraction, µ is the permeability and
ǫ is the dielectric constant of the medium, which are in general function of position. We will assume µ = 1, so that
n2 = ǫ.

The translational symmetry along the z-axis allows us to express the z-variation of the ﬁelds as

Following Jackson[32], we separate the ﬁelds and operators into components parallel and transverse to the z-axis and
write out the transverse projection of curl equations:

It’s evident from these four (scalar) equations that Ez and Bz are the fundamental ﬁelds we should be after, and
that once they are determined we can solve for E⊥ and B⊥. Thus, the Maxwell’s equations themselves completely
decouple, which was already obvious from Eq. (15). The actual complication of solving the vector Helmholtz equation
stems from the fact that the boundary conditions are coupled. The Maxwell boundary conditions are

on respective sides of the interface. ˆν is the unit normal on the interface, pointing towards out from the cylinder. We
will assume n1 = n > n2 = 1. Note that these are six conditions altogether. Focusing on the scalar ﬁelds Ez, Bz, we
have from the equations involving the cross-product with ˆν, E1z = E2z and B1z = B2z. Another pair of boundary
conditions can be found by projecting Eq. (18) onto the diad (ˆν, ˆs) deﬁned on the boundary of the cross-section ∂D

We are interested in the long-lived modes of the resonator. Modes with a ﬁnite kz correspond in short wavelength
limit to rays which spiral up and down along the cylinder walls and escape through the end-caps by refracting
0, and correspond to modes which are
out. Thus under most circumstances the longest lived modes have kz ≈
eﬀectively two-dimensional, i.e. can be expressed by dynamics of rays on the cross-sectional plane. In that case, the
boundary conditions Eq. (22) also become diagonal and we have a complete decoupling. We will choose to work with
ψi(x, y) = Eiz(x, y), corresponding to TM polarized ﬁelds, for which the problem reduces to the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation for the scalar ﬁeld ψ with continuity conditions

Note that this boundary value problem is equivalent to that of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation of quantum
mechanics. Hereafter, we will drop all references to the original three-dimensional and vector character of the problem
and work with Eqs. (23)-(24).

VI. SCATTERING QUANTIZATION-PHILOSOPHY AND METHODOLOGY

In this section we will describe a numerical method to solve Eq. (24), which is both eﬃcient and physically appealing.
Our approach is a generalization to open systems (speciﬁcally, dielectric resonators) of the scattering quantization
approach to quantum billiards[15, 16]. This approach is based on the observation that every quantum billiard interior
problem (Helmholtz equation for a bounded region with Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions) can be viewed as
a scattering problem, and the spectrum can be uniquely deduced from the knowledge of the corresponding scattering
operator. In the case of closed systems, the internal scattering problem can be mapped rigorously to an external
scattering problem[17], and the resulting (exact) scattering matrix is unitary. For the dielectric resonator problem
with radiation boundary conditions, we will see that the corresponding scattering operator is inherently non-unitary,
reﬂecting the physical fact that we are dealing with a leaky system. Thus we will deﬁne below a new “S-matrix”
which is non-unitary and distinct from the true S-matrix describing external scattering from the system. We retain the
terminology “S-matrix” nonetheless because of the conceptual similarity to the quantum billiard method of [15, 16].
The generalization of this approach to dielectric billiards was ﬁrst made in Ref.[47], however without the eﬃcient
algorithm presented below.

We assume that the resonator is bounded by the interface ∂D of the form r = R(φ), where R(φ) is some smooth
deformation of the boundary such that there exists only one point of the boundary for each angle φ. We decompose
the internal and external ﬁelds into cylindrical harmonics with a constant k

conditions by itself. Note that
basis, the expansion is exact for r < Rmin and r > Rmax as long as the sum runs over an inﬁnite number of terms,
where Rmin and Rmax are the lower and upper bounds of R(φ) respectively. The assumption that the expansions
can be analytically continued to the region Rmin < r < Rmax is known as the Rayleigh hypothesis[56]. It has been
shown[66] that for a family of deformations parametrized by ǫ, there is typically a critical deformation ǫc, beyond
which the hypothesis breaks down because the expansion ceases to be analytic in the region Rmin < r < Rmax. For
the deformations Eq. (8), this happens long after the shape becomes concave; we are not interested in this regime.
Although this issue seems thus to be resolved, we shall see that precursors of the non-convergence emerge in the form
of numerical instabilities for ǫ < ǫc.

We will assume that δm = 0 (no incoming waves), thus conﬁning our attention to quasi-bound modes. Turning
to the interior expansion, the regularity of the solution at the origin requires that we take αm = βm, but we will
not implement this condition at this stage. The continuity conditions Eq. (24) give us further relations among the
remaining coeﬃcients:

In Eq. (29), we have replaced the normal derivative condition by the radial derivative condition, because Eq. (28)
shows that the tangential derivatives are also continuous. Note that this latter set of equations containing radial
derivatives is equivalent to the set of equations (24) using normal derivatives.

ζ(k) = 0. An often employed numerical procedure involves a sweep in the complex k-plane of the singular values of the
operator T (k) = 1
(k), with proper care of the numerical null-space of T (k)[5]. This requires several calculations
of the entries of T (k) and its singular value decomposition per quantized state. In the next section, we will represent
an eﬃcient root-ﬁnding method, which ideally requires two diagonalizations per nkR quantized states. Before doing
that however, it’s worthwhile to investigate the structure of

(k) based on simple physical considerations.

First of all, at a given k, an angular momentum eigenstate ψ±

(k) in Fig. 7 reveals that as m grows beyond a critical value mc ≈

m, for which m > nkRmax is a closed channel for
the internal scattering system, because it corresponds to classical motion with a circular caustic of radius larger
than Rmax. Such channels are called evanescent, and are not not expected to be scattered signiﬁcantly.
In fact,

matrix becomes strongly diagonal i.e. [

|
nkRmin <
< nkRmax, where the matrix is heading towards diagonality, and this region corresponds to
evanescent components which undergo an enhanced scattering because they overlap signiﬁcantly with only certain
regions of the resonator. This region grows with the deformation of the resonator, and consequently, Λev evanecent
channels have to be included in the number Λ of (positive) channels contributing to a given internal scattering matrix.
Deonoting the critical matrix size at the evanescent channel boundary by Λsc = [[nkRmin]] ([[.]] stands for the integer
part), the size of the S-matrix is then Ntrunc = 2Λ + 1, with Λ = Λsc + Λev.

Our ﬁrst observation is that all the eigenvalues are strictly distributed within the unit circle

= 1, i.e. Im [ϕ] < 0.
This is because of the restriction of solutions to outgoing waves only. Furthermore, there is an accumulation of
eigenvalues on the boundary of the circle, particularly at θ = 2π+. As we have established, an eigenvalue for which
ϕ(l)(k) = 2π within a given numerical precision yields a quantized mode of the resonator. However, we should resist
the temptation to simply take all the scattering eigenstates whose eigenphases are ϕ
2π to be quantized. As
was pointed out in Ref.[15] in the case of a closed system, there is an accumulation of scattering eigenphases at
2π+, which do not correspond to proper physical eigenmodes of the resonator. These are modes, which are
ϕ
primarily composed of evanescent channels, and can easily be distinguished from regular modes, because of their lack
of k-dependence, as we shall see below.

A. Zero deformation-Case of the rotationally symmetric dielectric

A lot can be learned by way of a simple example. We will consider a case where we know the exact solutions,
namely the dielectric circle. The exact eigenstates of the scattering matrix for the circle can be given a precise
physical meaning in terms of classical processes in the short wavelength limit. They correspond to motion with a
conserved angular momentum, or in terms of our notation in section (III), a given impact angle sin χ on the dielectric
interface. The resulting scattering matrix is diagonal in the angular momentum representation. This signiﬁes the
fact that a “channel” with a given m upon encountering the boundary will be scattered to the same channel m,
corresponding to specular reﬂection. The scattering matrix can be written as

is the external scattering matrix for the closed circular cavity, which is unitary. Then our quantization condition

which is the exact quantization condition for wavevectors nk of a metallic cavity. Hence in the form Eq. (42), the

nkR. As noted, these entries correspond to scattering of evanescent channels and result in eigenphases
for m
(1 + 2n)e−2mα. Thus, the accumulation of eigenphases on the unit circle close to the
exponentially close to zero, ϕ
quantization point ϕ = 2π in Fig. 8 can be linked to such extremely evanescent channels, which are not the physical
modes of the cavity. These modes can be interpreted as creeping waves, which are evanescent modes which cling to
the surface of the resonator[52]. Note that the number of such scattering eigenstates depends strongly on our choice
of Λev in our numerical implementation.

Next, we will look at the internally reﬂected channels. These are obtained for the entries kR < m < nkR. The

FIG. 9: Geometric representation of the angle β; the velocity of the eigenvalues in the complex plane is 2 sin β, which is also the
chord-length of the corresponding ray. We note that for the diametral two-bounce orbit the speed is maximal (corresponding
to the minimum free spectral range) while for whispering gallery modes the chord length is minimal and the free spectral range
is the largest.

The picture this entails is the following: When we slowly increase k, the individual eigenphases move with an
approximately constant but mode-dependent speed given by Eq. (49) counter-clockwise around the unit circle. Each
time one of the eigenphases passes through ϕ = 2π, the quantization condition is fulﬁlled and the resulting eigenvector
is a quantized mode of the resonator. Hence, the eigenvectors of
(k) can be assigned a physical meaning and identity
even when k is not tuned to resonance ϕ(k) = 2π. In the present case, they correspond to totally internal reﬂected
whispering gallery modes.

Last, we investigate the classically open channels, which corresponds to rays which are refracted out. In this regime

Note that the algebraic prefactor is the Fresnel reﬂection factor for a ray coming in at an angle χi = π

the proximity of the scattering eigenphase to the unit-circle is a measure of the lifetime. The smaller the radius of

the eigenphase, the smaller is the associated lifetime. As we change k, the variation of the eigenphase of a given
solution will be dominated by the phase-factor eiΘ. The path to quantization goes thus by ﬁrst increasing Re [k] until
Re [Θ] = 2π, and then adding a small imaginary part i∆k so that

B. Deformed dielectric resonators

In light of our ﬁndings for the undeformed case, it is possible to develop a powerful search strategy for the general,
deformed case. The reason behind our ability to “track” the scattering eigenphases through quantization in the case
of the circular resonator was the fact that the angular momentum channels didn’t mix when we changed k, owing
to the diagonality of the scattering matrix over all k i.e. there we had a good label m which was conserved. This
will not be the case when we deform the resonator. For small deformations, the internal scattering matrix
(k) will
remain approximately diagonal, with ﬂuctuations due to inter-channel scattering. The resulting eigenstates will show
a broadening in their angular momentum distributions. In that case, one can still deﬁne an average phase velocity
given by

At ﬁrst sight, there is no reason for such a solution to persist over a given interval ∆k. Following Ref.[19], we suggest
that the scattering eigenvectors have an identity beyond a given k-value, and more importantly, that the resonances,
the quantized modes, have an identity even when they don’t fully satisfy the boundary conditions. We can quantify
this statement by deﬁning a simple scalar product between eigenvectors of the internal S-matrix at diﬀerent k:

correlations among the matrix elements induced by the underlying classical motion in the short wavelength limit. We
have already emphasized the connection between the scattering matrix in the short wavelength limit and the classical
SOS map. As long as there are invariant curves in the SOS, which we have seen is guaranteed by the KAM scenario
for near-integrable deformations in section (III), there will be eigenstates of the scattering matrix which will display
the aforementioned adiabatic behavior.

classical structures are found from the Husimi projections of the respective states (see Fig. 11). The schematics identify the
ray orbits with which they are associated (see discussion in text). At this deformation the short two-bounce orbit is stable, the
long one unstable; the diamond orbit is stable and the ﬁsh and triangle orbits are unstable.

are performed at regular intervalls k = k0 + j∆k, where n∆kR = 0.03. At each step, there is in general a single state
having markedly higher overlap with the respective original state at k0 than the others and that value is plotted. The
result shows that an adiabatic identity can be in fact deﬁned for certain states. This procedure allows the tracking of
majority of the states, as long as the deformation is not too large. In fact, it’s possible to show that

At this point it may be helpful to clarify what we mean by the “identity” of a state in the chaotic case in which
the state is not associated with a stable periodic orbit or a family of quasi-periodic orbits. In Fig. 11 we show both
a real-space solution for the electric ﬁeld of a TM resonance and its projection onto the surface of section using the
Husimi-SOS projection technique deﬁned in section (VIII). This method allows one to associate any solution, even
a non-quantized one, with a region in the SOS and hence with an approximate ray-dynamical (classical) meaning.
Furthermore, at the values of nkR at which we work, often these chaotic states are associated with unstable periodic
orbits or their unstable manifolds (this is the case in Figs. 10 and 11); in Fig. 11 the top states are associated with
the unstable ﬁsh orbit and the bottom states are associated with the unstable manifolds of the unstable two-bounce
orbit along the major axis of the resonator. States localized on unstable periodic orbits have been termed “scars” in
the quantum chaos literature and will be discussed further in section (X).

It turns out that one can extend this strategy to higher deformations, where the SOS displays large chaotic com-
ponents, with proper attention to eigenstates which have an appreciable overlap with chaotic regions. A typical
scenario which is encountered is the avoided crossing of two scattering eigenvectors. This is captured in Fig. 11,
where two eigenvectors are traced over a mean-level spacing. Originally, the two states are well-distinguished; they
have approximately zero overlap with each other. They have diﬀerent classical meaning as well as shown by their
Husimi projections on the SOS (see section (VIII) for deﬁnition). One state is associated with the border of the
stable bouncing ball region of the SOS and has no intensity near φ = 0, π; the other is concentrated in the separatrix
region associated with the unstable period two orbit along the major axis (we have plotted its unstable manifold for
reference). At the crossing they perturb each other strongly, and an approximate superposition state results. However,
if we continue changing k, the states emerging from the avoided crossing will still have a pronounced overlap with the
states before the crossing. Notice that the overlaps are calculated with reference to one of the original states
.

This example represents a case where a numerical tracing algorithm has to be properly conditioned.

19

FIG. 11: Two eigenvectors are traced by the criterion that the overlap is largest in two consecutive iterations. The ﬁgure shows
the overlap of the two sets of states resulting with respect to one of the initial states, |α0i. Away from the avoided crossing
the states have distinct classical meaning as discussed in the text; they exchange “identity” at the avoided crossing. Both the
real-space electric ﬁeld intensities are shown (false color scale) and the Husimi-SOS projections of the states before and after
the avoided crossing.

After having established that we can assign an identity to the scattering eigenvectors as k varies, we next investigate
how precisely the corresponding eigenvalues move within the complex unit circle as we vary k, both through real and
imaginary values. Fig. 12a) shows such a tracing of several representative states. First, the initial eigenvalues are
followed while varying the real part of k; each of the eigenvalues follow approximately a circular trajectory, followed
by a pure imaginary change in k resulting in the eigenvalues following an almost precisely radial path. We write the
= eη(k) and call θ the angle in the complex plane for the eigenvalue eiθ(k).
radius of the complex eigenvalue as
This simple behavior can be understood from the fact that the classical channels (of angular momentum in our
case) in the expansion preserve their identity over a mean level spacing, and the weight of these channels embodied
in the expansion coeﬃcients αm change only O
. In conclusion, the radial and angular speeds of the eigenvalue
are approximately “decoupled”. This speed is to high accuracy constant for the eigenphases, i.e. for the log of the
eigenvalues as shown in Fig. 12b, c.

with k, we simply use their non-quantized values in the expansion with the

instead of the original k.

In the ideal case this means that Ntrunc ∼

nkR quasi-bound modes are found in only two diagonalizations. In
practice, this ideal limit is not fully attained. But, depending on the deformation and the value of nkR, a large
fraction of the quasi-bound modes can be calculated approximately in this manner. Table Fig. I shows a typical
run and the quality of the results compared to “exact” solutions. For increased numerical stability we have found it

FIG. 12: Several representative eigenvalues z (corresponding to states associated with the ray orbits above and below via color
code) traced in the complex plane as one changes the real and imaginary values of k. First Re [k] is varied resulting in the
circular arcs of ﬁxed radius (Im [z]); subsequently Im [k] is varied resulting in a radial motion and ﬁxed Re [k]. On the right
hand side we show the constancy of the derivative of the phase angle θ with respect to Re [nkR] and of the derivative of the
logarithm of the radius η(k) with respect to Im [nkR], implying constant speed of the eigenphases as a function of k in the
complex plane. The simulations are performed at ǫ = 0.12 quadrupolar deformation, n = 2.65.

convenient to use the same algorithm in the context of solving the equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem for the
system; this is discussed brieﬂy in the Appendix A.

The implementation of the algorithm can be adapted to the particular result of interest. In fact, when the quan-
tization of a single state is desired, a more exact eigenphase quantization can be performed by multiple-scans with
update of the speeds, quite like Newton’s root-search method.

As already hinted, the method is most powerful when applied to calculate classically meaningful quantities (such
as the Husimi projection, see section (VIII) below) for which ﬁnding the quantized k values is not important. This
is most evident in considering the physical observables which are unique to the open systems, the farﬁeld emission
patterns and the boundary image ﬁelds. The calculation of these observables will be described below.

On the other hand, it has to be pointed out that an attempt to plot an internal solution away from quantization is

not meaningful because of the nature of the Hankel function basis. The internal ﬁeld would be

VIII. THE HUSIMI PROJECTION TECHNIQUE FOR OPTICAL DIELECTRIC RESONATORS

In this section, we will describe the Husimi Projection technique, which allows us to relate a given mode to the
phase space structures in the SOS. Just as for quantum wavefunctions, for these two-dimensional electromagnetic
ﬁelds we can represent the solutions in real space (the solutions we have been calculating) or, by Fourier transforming
them, in momentum space. However we are interested in representing the solutions in the phase-space of the problem
so that we can understand their ray-dynamical meaning, and ultimately in projecting such phase space densities onto
the SOS which is our standard interpretive tool. Just as in quantum mechanics, we cannot have full information
about real-space and momentum space at the same time due to the analog of the uncertainty principle, which here is
reﬂected by the property of Fourier transforms:

∆x

∆p

·

≥

1
2k

(60)

where ∆x and ∆p are the widths of ψ(x) and ˜ψ(p) in real and momentum space. Thus our goal is to take the
solution ψ(x) and associate with it a momentum content in some region around each point x, recognizing that
our resolution in real space is limited by the uncertainty relation. One familiar method for doing this in quantum
mechanics is the Wigner distribution function[67], which preserves exactly certain moments of the wavefunction, but
has the interpretive problem that it can be negative in some regions of phase space and the practical problem that
it is typically subject to rapid oscillations. An alternative approach, which is often more useful, was introduced by
Husimi[31] and can be thought of as a gaussian smoothing of the Wigner distribution. In our context however one
can think of the Husimi projection as a “windowed” two-dimensional Fourier transform, which is designed to respect
the uncertainty relation. This is equivalent to projecting on coherent states
which are optimally localized
in both momentum and conﬁguration space, in the sense that the projection saturates the inequality Eq. (60) at its
lower bound

and equal resolution in both spaces is ensured through the choice of σ0. This is a free parameter of the method, and
for best results it has to be carefully determined based on the domains of variation of the conjugate pair (p, x). The

As deﬁned the Husimi distribution is on a four-dimensional phase space of the billiard (restricted to a three-
dimensional shell because the momentum is normalized to unity). One can visualize this distribution then as a vector
ﬁeld on a grid of size η2/2 in real space[29]; however based on our earlier discussion we ﬁnd it more illuminating to
deﬁne a projection of the Husimi distribution onto the surface of section of the billiard.

For billiard systems, this idea was ﬁrst carried out in Ref.[14], but a diﬀerent section was used than we are using
here. We instead follow an approach similar to the one described in Ref.[27]. The problem is that the boundary of
the billiard is not a constant coordinate surface of some convenient coordinate system. We therefore use cylindrical
coordinates to deﬁne our Husimi-SOS projection and then use the classical map to map our result onto the boundary.

The coherent states in cylindrical coordinates take the form:

where

Z¯r ¯φ ¯pr ¯pφ(r, φ) = Z¯r ¯pr (r)Z ¯φ ¯pφ(φ)

The sum on l is necessary to insure periodicity in the φ variable. We deﬁne the projection of the full four-dimensional

IX. FARFIELD DISTRIBUTIONS

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

In typical micro-laser experiments there are two basic data-acquisition modes. In the farﬁeld acquisition mode, the
CCD camera is used without a lens and aperture as a simple photo-diode, and at each farﬁeld angle θ, the farﬁeld
emission intensity IF F (θ) is recorded. The farﬁeld emission pattern is one of the few clues we have as to the lasing
mode of the resonator. Our algorithm is very eﬃcient in calculating all possible farﬁelds achievable with a given
resonator shape and index of refraction. At a given k which is chosen close to the lasing frequency ω = ck, we solve
the scattering problem without reference to any quantization condition. The farﬁelds are computed from the external
wavefunction Eq. (26) by using the large-argument asymptotic form of the Hankel function[1]

where we have extracted all the quantities independent of m and φ. The farﬁeld intensity distributions computed
in this way are very well-behaved and insensitive to the k-value used, because the strongly-varying Hankel functions
drop out of this quantity.

FIG. 13: Far-ﬁeld emission intensity pattern for a “ﬁsh” mode, quantized at kR = 19.7392 − 0.06240i (solid black line) and at
kR = 21.0210 − 0.06240i (dashed line). The (dash dot) and (dotted) line are the far-ﬁeld of the unquantized states in between
with eigenvalues z = −0.4664 + 0.5692i and z = 0.3407 − 0.6472i. Clearly the essential features of the emission patterns are
calculable with non-quantized modes. In the inset we show the eigenvalues z in the unit circle.

As seen in Fig. 13, the farﬁelds computed are virtually identical to those obtained from the quantized modes as k is
varied over two level-spacings. Using this simpliﬁcation the method here can be used to evaluate all possible emission
patterns for a wide range of dielectric resonators very rapidly.

Several recent experiments have studied dielectric micro-lasers using an imaging technique for data acquisition[11,
58, 59, 61]; the CCD camera records a magniﬁed image of the intensity proﬁle on the sidewall viewed from angle θ in
the farﬁeld (see Fig. 14). The pixels then can be mapped to sidewall angle φ via the solution of a simple transcendental
equation. This yields a two-dimensional plot, called the boundary image-ﬁeld, where a given data point I(φ, θ) denotes
the intensity emitted from sidewall position φ towards the farﬁeld angle θ. The latter can easily be converted to an
incidence angle sin χ, using Snell’s law and basic trigonometry. Hence what is recorded is actually a phase space plot
of the emitted radiation.

in ref.[59]; the lens and aperture are in the far-ﬁeld and the schematic is not to scale. b) experimental data on lasing emission

FIG. 15: A numerically calculated transverse series of modes based on the bow-tie periodic orbit. Such modes were observed

bowtie periodic orbit hits the boundary exactly at the critical angle. a) the fundamental mode, b) the ﬁrst excited mode c) the
second excited mode. Note the strong “near-ﬁeld” ﬂuctuations, particularly in the case of the second order mode in c). In the
middle row we have their Poincar´e-Husimi distributions. On the bottom we have for each of the modes a calculated boundary
image, showing that one can clearly distinguish the three diﬀerent modes from their boundary-image ﬁelds.

The aperture has an important role of deﬁning a window in the direction space (∆ sin χ), so that a given pixel on
the camera can be identiﬁed up to a diﬀraction limited resolution with a pair (φ, sin χ). Mathematically, the eﬀect
of the lens-aperture combination is equivalent to a windowed Fourier transform of the incident ﬁeld on the lens[24];
thus it is simply connected to the Husimi distributions we have just discussed[61]. Note that inﬁnite aperture limit is
simply a Fourier transform of the incident ﬁeld and we lose all the information about direction sin χ, consistent with
our intuition with conjugate variables. It has to be emphasized that image data only probes the farﬁeld, and does not
contain the “near-ﬁeld” details we would see in a typical numerical solution, nor does it contain information about
the internally reﬂected components of the cavity ﬁeld (see Appendix B for further details). On the other hand, it
contains (with some ﬁnite resolution) the same information as the Husimi distribution of the emitting components of
the ﬁeld and does allows us therefore to put forward a ray interpretation of the emission and the internal resonance.
The boundary-image ﬁeld of a numerically obtained resonance can be calculated as described in Appendix B. In
Fig. 15 we plot the boundary-image ﬁelds of three “bow-tie” modes of diﬀerent transverse excitation number (based
on a stable periodic orbit with the geometry of a bow-tie, see discussion below).

26

X. QUASI-BOUND MODES AND CLASSICAL PHASE SPACE STRUCTURES

In this section, we would like to illustrate the relation between the quasi-bound states and classical phase space
structures using the results generated by the numerical algorithm described in section (VII) and Appendix A. We
note at the beginning that the real-space plots and the Husimi distributions are constructed using the nonquantized
scattering eigenvectors, as we described in the previous section.

Consider ﬁrst the near-integrable regime in the quadrupolar deformation. In Fig. 16(a), we plot a whispering gallery
mode of the circle at ǫ = 0 and in Fig. 16(b) is plotted a state which emits from the highest curvature points φ = 0, π.
Inspection of the respective Husimi distributions shows clearly that the ﬁrst state is localized on an invariant curve
sin χ = const. and is (nearly) totally internally reﬂected, because the localization is at sin χ > sin χc. Note that the
second state is a deformed whispering gallery mode, localized on an invariant curve which is no longer a straight line
in the SOS.

FIG. 16: Real-space false color plot of regular quasi-periodic solutions at (a) ǫ = 0, and (c) ǫ = 0.03. (b), (d) Husimi projections
of states (a), (c). The solutions are obtained at nkR = 82 and n = 2.

Large islands in the SOS (corresponding to stable periodic orbits) support multiple modes, which can be calculated
approximately by the methods of Gaussian optics[65]. We have already seen a typical sequence of such modes based
on the bow-tie periodic orbit in Fig. 15. In general, it’s possible to ﬁnd such series of modes corresponding to any
stable island of sizable extent in the SOS, with two characteristic spacings, the free spectral range ∆k = 2π/L (L is
the length of the periodic orbit), and the transverse mode spacing, which depends on the eigenvalues of the stability
matrix[65].

The importance of periodic orbits is not limited to stable orbits. There are an inﬁnite number of unstable periodic
orbits in the SOS. Short periodic orbits, especially those which are least unstable, can make their presence felt in the
mode structure of the resonators, despite the fact that the methods of Gaussian optics fail for such modes[65]. Such
modes are referred to as “scars” in the quantum chaos literature; they display an enhanced intensity along an unstable
periodic orbit and have been widely studied[28, 34]. In the numerical studies of Refs.[19, 55], evidence was found that
modes can localize not only on the unstable ﬁxed points but on their associated stable and unstable manifolds as well.
In Fig. 17(a)-(f) we show a series of three states associated with the shortest unstable periodic orbit of the system,

27

FIG. 17: Real-space plots and Husimi distributions of modes which are related to the unstable bouncing ball orbit (scars, see
text). Superimposed on the SOS are the stable and unstable manifolds of this orbit which seem to play a role in localizing the
solutions in certain regions of the chaotic component of phase space. (a), (b) represent a simple scar of the two-bounce orbit;
(c), (d) and (e), (f) are states localized on intersections of the manifolds and appear more chaotic in real space. These solutions
are found at nkR = 106, ǫ = 0.12 and n = 2.65.

the unstable bouncing ball orbit. Note that the ﬁrst mode represents the “fundamental” mode which localizes on the
ﬁxed point itself (see Fig. 17(b)). The real-space plots Fig. 17(c) and Fig. 17(e) don’t show any distinct structure.
Their respective Husimi plots Fig. 17(d) and Fig. 17(f), however reveals that the modes localize on the heteroclinic
intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds emanating from the unstable bouncing ball ﬁxed points. A similar
behavior was reported in Ref.[19] in the context of a quantum billiard. Finally, at large deformations the spectrum
contains chaotic modes which cannot easily be associated with any particular classical phase space structure. One
such mode is plotted in Fig. 18. Note that the support of the mode is entirely in the chaotic portion of the SOS.
Recalling our arguments in section (II) as to the failure of eikonal methods, it is instructive to note here the complexity
of the wavefronts and the large portions of the resonator in which no series of parallel wavefronts is discernible.

XI. CONCLUSION

We have considered a general class of optical resonators which are based on deformations of cylindrical dielectric
resonators. Such resonators are being studied for applications in integrated optics and optoelectronics, and for their
intrinsic interest as wave-chaotic systems. The basic physics of such resonators can be best understood by application
of methods from classical and quantum chaos, applicable in the short-wavelength limit.

We have pointed out the characteristic global breakdown of conventional geometric optics approaches due to the
transition to chaos in the associated ray dynamics. While real-space ray tracing methods quickly become powerless
with increasing deformation (degree of chaos), the essential structures are uncovered eﬀectively in the Poincar´e
surface of section. Information about important physical properties of deformed dielectric resonators and lasers, such
as emission characteristics, internal modal distributions, spectra and lifetimes can be extracted from the types of
ray motion in the equivalent refractive billiard system. However no general analytic technique exists for calculating
approximately all of the modes of a generic resonator of this type.

We present an eﬃcient numerical method for the calculation of quasi-bound modes of dielectric cavities. The method
we are proposing is a hybrid between a point-matching technique[44] and scattering approach to quantization[16, 19].
In contrast to existing methods[30, 44, 48] which employ the external scattering matrix to extract the quasi-bound
modes of a dielectric resonator, we consider the internal scattering operator[15, 16, 17]. An important conceptual
diﬀerence with respect to wave-function matching methods is that the internal scattering approach permits the
identiﬁcation of a discrete set of internal scattering states at each value of k. This is realized by writing the matching
conditions in the form of an oﬀ-shell eigenvalue problem instead of a linear inhomogeneous equation. Many of the
physical properties of the modes within a given linewidth of the order of 1/nk0R around k0 are contained in the
eigenvectors of the internal S-matrix at k0, and can be extracted without quantizing the mode (i.e. without tuning k
to satisfy the boundary conditions). The quantized spectrum and the exact quasi-bound modes can be easily accessed
by an extrapolation technique which requires only two diagonalizations of this S-matrix. In principle variants of this
technique can be extended to very high wavevectors k since it scales only the perimeter of the resonator.

Finally, we present a version of the Husimi projection technique well-suited to dielectric resonators and show that

the scattering eigenvectors as well as quasi-bound modes are structured by classical phase-space structures.

In conclusion, the methods and tools presented in this work provide a uniﬁed conceptual framework for treating

dielectric resonators beyond the standard numerical approaches to such electromagnetic problems.

APPENDIX A: NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

Although the development in the text using the eigenvalue problem for the truncated S-matrix

(k) is perfectly
sound, its direct implementation is not very eﬃcient. The numerical problems already surface at the stage of computing
the truncated scattering matrix
(k) itself. The expression given in Eq. (37) requires numerical inversion of 5 matrices.
At a given k, as the number of channels Λ of the interior matrices designated by index 1 grows beyond Λsc, they
become increasingly more singular.

S

As evident from our previous discussion, this ill-conditioning is caused by blindly including evanescent channels
in the scattering problem. A quick solution is to truncate the matrices at the singularity boundary suggested by
our ray interpretation and include only Λsc = [[nkRmin]] channels of
. But this turns out to produce some states
|
which do not satisfy the boundary conditions well enough. As noted in[16], some of the evanescent channels Λev
have to be kept, enough to be able to proceed with our numerical computation and provide the missing (evanescent)
components of those states which require it. Thus, the properly truncated scattering matrix will have a size of
Ntrunc = 2(Λsc + Λev) + 1.

This way, the common null-space of the matrices A and B can be removed by existing powerful generalized eigenvalue

This method turns out to be more stable than the one based on inversion, and yields good results with arbitrarily
large Λev. The numerical problems associated with the regions of evanescent behavior (Rmin < r < Rmax) remain,
but are tractable for nkR <

APPENDIX B: LENS TRANSFORM

In the experimental imaging system, radiation emanating from the resonator is collected through an aperture and
after passing through a lens, an image is recorded for a discrete number of angles in the farﬁeld. The resonator is
placed at the focal plane of the lens, so that the image is eﬀectively formed at inﬁnity. Just in front of the lens the ﬁeld
distribution is given by the resonance wavefunction Ψ(x) which, at the observation (FF) angle θ, can be expressed as:

where φ = tan−1 x
is given by

z1 ≈

z1 . The lens eﬀectively adds a quadratic phase, so that the ﬁeld immediately behind the lens

Here P (x) is the pupil function, which takes care of the eﬀect of the aperture, f is the focal length of the lens and x
is the position on the lens. The ﬁeld at the camera is given by propagating this ﬁeld with the Fresnel propagator[24],
which is well-justiﬁed as the lens-camera distance is much larger than the wavelength

Note that the imageﬁeld contains only information captured from the farﬁeld distribution. The actual details of the
resonance in the “nearﬁeld” can be quiet diﬀerent, due to evanescent contributions close to critical incidence. For
instance, the points of brightest emission inferred from the imageﬁeld might be shifted due to an “optical mirage”-
like eﬀect (see Fig. 15c)). The mirage is formed not because of a continuously varying index of refraction but a
discontinuous interface.

The imageﬁeld has an interesting connection to the (SOS projected) Husimi distribution. The Husimi distribution

of the ﬁeld projected onto the SOS at a distance R

is given by

Comparing with Eq. (B10), we see that the two functions are contain almost the same information.
In fact, by
choosing an aperture which has a gaussian transmittance P (x), one would obtain exactly the same form as Eq. (B10).
Note that the freedom of smoothing to obtain various phase space distributions which represent the same physical
system gains here a physical meaning, namely it translates to the choice of optical apparatus (lens, aperture etc.)
to observe the resonator. This connection was used in reference[61] to reconstruct from the boundary-image ﬁeld a
Husimi function for the emitted radiation which was found to agree well with ray escape simulations.

The physical origins of negative refractive index are derived from a dilute microscopic model, pro-
ducing a result that is generalized to the dense condensed phase limit. In particular, scattering from
a thin sheet of electric and magnetic dipoles driven above resonance is used to form a fundamental
description for negative refraction. Of practical signiﬁcance, loss and dispersion are implicit in the
microscopic model. While naturally occurring negative index materials are unavailable, ferromag-
netic and ferroelectric materials provide device design opportunities.

In 1968, Veselago suggested that a material with a
negative index of refraction would enjoy certain pecu-
liar properties. Foremost among these was negative re-
fraction, where a ray incident on the interface of such a
material would refract on the same side of the normal
rather than away from it [1]. The subject lay dormant
until 1999, when Pendry proposed designs for magnetic
metamaterials [2] that were subsequently implemented
by Shelby et al., along with a dispersed electric meta-
material, to demonstrate negative refraction in 2001 [3].
Despite the fact that no naturally occurring negative in-
dex material is available, there has been a surge in inter-
est, particularly with regard to the prospect of creating
a perfect lens [4].

In this Letter, we explore the physical origins of the
negative index of refraction. The formalism developed
here diﬀers from previous macroscopic descriptions of
negative refraction in that it is developed from a micro-
scopic model consisting of an array of electric dipoles and
magnetic dipoles undergoing precession due to an exter-
nal static magnetic ﬁeld. By considering the extension
of the microscopic model to a macroscopic electromag-
netic description, a physical basis for why the propaga-
tion speed of light, vp, should appear negative when the
permittivity and permeability are simultaneously nega-
tive is established. This extends the macroscopic argu-
ments originally formulated by Veselago [1], and, for ex-
ample, applied under the context of a Drude model [5],
to include a physical, microscopic basis. Finally, we use
the microscopic model to suggest some possibilities for
the use of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials to
enhance the capabilities of negative index metamateri-
als.

To illustrate how negative refraction might arise, we
apply Fermat’s principle of least time [6] to the case
of negative refractive index materials and interpret it in

terms of least action. Consider the path of least action
for a stream of photons in vacuum (n1 = 1) incident on a
homogeneous, isotropic material with an index of refrac-
tion n2. The most probable path is determined by the
path of stationary phase, which corresponds to an ex-
tremum in the spatial derivative of the total travel time
through all possible paths. This is well established for
the case of positive refraction. From the diagram in Fig-
ure 1(a), the optical path length in vacuum from source
A to the interface point O is c1t1 = AO = pa2 + y2,
and in the semi-inﬁnite material from O to B it is c2t2 =
OB = pb2 + (l
y)2. To ﬁnd the extremum in the time
of travel from A to B, we form d(t1 + t2)/dy = 0, with
a and b ﬁxed at arbitrary values, which upon substitut-
ing for the optical path lengths gives n1y/c0pa2 + y2 =
y)2, with l
n2(l
0. Recognizing
the trigonometric relations sin(θ1) = y/pa2 + y2 and
y)2, this can be rewritten in
sin(θ2) = (l
−
the familiar form of Snell’s law: n1 sin(θ1) = n2 sin(θ2).
If we postulate that the photons refract to the other
side of the normal, as depicted in Figure 1(b), then
0, which implies that the angle of refraction be-

comes
θ2. The extremum for this optical path gives
n1y/c0pa2 + y2 =
y)2, which
−
can only be satisﬁed if n2 < 0. Since n1 sin(θ1) > 0
and sin(
sin(θ2), Snell’s law is found to be
valid for both positive and negative refraction, provided
we allow for the possibility of a negative index of re-
fraction. The curvature becomes d2(t1 + t2)/dy2 =
n1/[c0(a2 + y2)3/2] + n2/[c0(b2 + (l
y)2)3/2]. For n2 > 0,
the curvature is positive, indicating that Fermat’s result
indeed gives the minimum time (and distance). Interest-
ingly, for n2 < 0, the curvature is negative, indicating
a maxima.
In terms of least time this result does not
make much sense, since the path for negative refraction
corresponds a maximum, but in terms of least action, the
path is acceptable upon recognizing that negative index
materials are causal in an energy sense but not in a tem-
poral sense, an issue we address further in relation to a
microscopic model.

To provide a mechanism for the apparent augmenta-
tion of the arrival time of the photons, we employ a mi-
croscopic model that replaces the slab with a thin sheet
of electric and magnetic dipoles, ﬁnd the ﬁelds due to
each source, and then apply superposition. We assume a
Lorentz electric dipole resonance and a Bloch magnetic
resonance.

damping constant.

Also within our slab is a sheet of magnetic dipoles
with a static external ﬁeld H0 applied in the ˆx-direction.
Equivalently, we could assume a slab of ordered spins,
where the static magnetic ﬁeld is provided by dipolar
coupling, as in the case of a ferromagnetic material. The
equation for the ﬁeld radiated by a magnetic dipole sheet,

We will employ some foresight and recognize that (7)
is the same as the index of refraction derived from the
macroscopic Maxwell’s equations for dense media of arbi-
trary thickness in the limit of small susceptibilities. Ac-
cordingly, we assume the usual form for the index of re-
fraction, n = √εrµr, where the relative permittivity is

for a light ray incident on a material with |n2| > |n1|. In a)
0 < n1 < n2 and in b) 0 < n1 < |n2| and n2 < 0.

The disparity between the frequency dependent speed
of light in a material and the constant speed of photons in
a vacuum is resolved by recognizing that photons imping-
ing on a medium can drive resonances in that medium,
which may radiate and contribute to the total scattered
ﬁeld. When there is a diﬀerence in phase between the
source and radiated ﬁeld, the wavefronts at the detector
will appear to be advanced or retarded with respect to
the source, and it is on this basis that the concept of
negative velocity is explained.

To relate our microscopic model to the index of re-
fraction, which is a macroscopic phenomenon, we employ
an approach developed by Feynman, thereby extending
the physical origins of the index of refraction to include
negative index materials [7]. Our system consists of a
monochromatic plane wave source of radial frequency ω
traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, c0, in the ˆx-
direction, incident on a slab of material of thickness d,
and a detector on the other side of the slab, suﬃciently
far away. If the slab were removed, then the observed
travel time to the detector, a distance x from the source,
would be commensurate with the speed of light in vac-
uum. When the material is present and an observed delay
or advance in arrival time is assumed, such that the ob-
served speed is c0/n, consider that the electric ﬁeld at
the detector is

z = E0ei ω
Ed

(1)

which is the source ﬁeld of initial strength E0 (neglect-
ing amplitude scatter in the dilute limit) multiplied by
a phase term. Feynman showed that for dilute media in
which the phase term is small, (1) can be written in a
more suggestive manner as [7]

Written this way, it is clear in (2) that the plane wave at
the detector is the sum of the source term (the incident
ﬁeld without the material) and a material response term
(the scattered ﬁeld). This representation is thus consis-
tent with the Born approximation for scattered photons.

εr = 1 + χε and the relative permeability is µr = 1 + χµ,
so as to not limit our discussion to dilute materials with
weak susceptibilities. What we gain by doing so is that
a layer of dipoles can augment the source ﬁeld for subse-
quent layers of dipoles.

is the free space admittance, the inverse of the wave
impedance. The domain for the index of refraction and
the wave impedance come from the range of the permit-
tivity and the permeability. Accordingly, with the loss
implied by the damping in (4) and (5), the permittivity
and permeability are restricted to the upper-half of the
complex plane, in order for a propagating wave to lose
energy (under the assumed e−iωt convention). Thus, φε,µ
is in the interval [0, π], and the index of refraction shares
π. However,
the same interval, since 0
the domain of the wave impedance phase is [
π/2, π/2],
since
π/2. Note that loss becomes

more signiﬁcant in the neighborhood of the resonances.
However, even perturbational loss poses limitations on
the potential ampliﬁcation of evanescent ﬁelds in a neg-
ative index slab [10].

The eﬀect of the index of refraction on the source
ﬁeld as it propagates through the slab is seen by in-
troducing the polar form of the index of refraction into
(1) and replacing the thickness d with the indepen-
dent coordinate system in Figure 1. From (1), ignor-
ing the time dependence, and assuming d = x, we get
z (x) = E0e(−ωx|n|/c0) sin φnei(ωx|n|)/c0) cos φn . By use of

either the right hand rule or Faraday’s law, we ﬁnd that
the magnetic ﬁeld associated with propagation in the x-
eiφY Ed
direction is H d
z (x). Thus, the wave

admittance introduces a relative phase shift in the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁeld, which has consequences on power
ﬂow.

In the case of a material with only electric dipole cou-
pling, the value of φε is restricted to the interval [0, π]
and φµ = 0. This limits the range of φn and φY to the
interval [0, π/2]. However, if we allow for the simultane-
ous existence of magnetic and electric dipole coupling, we
ﬁnd that the interval for the phase of the index of refrac-
tion becomes [0, π] and the interval for the wave admit-
tance becomes [
π/2, π/2]. The most interesting result
of this additional phase contribution comes from consid-
eration of a material that without the magnetic dipole
resonance would exhibit a bandgap for the frequency un-
der consideration, assuming negligible loss, resulting in
an evanescent wave.
If we introduce a small magnetic
phase contribution, then we ﬁnd a return to a propa-
gating wave solution. In the lossless electric dipole only
case, the ﬁeld does not propagate and does not carry real
power because the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are π/2
radians out of phase. However, when both electric and

−

magnetic dipole coupling is present, the phase contribu-
tion from the magnetic dipole can ’undo’ the deleterious
eﬀects of the electric dipole by partially restoring the rel-
ative phase of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds such that
power can ﬂow. In the remarkable case that φε and φµ
are both equal to π (or 0), it follows that φn = π (or
0) and φY = 0, and we ﬁnd that propagation results
with no attenuation, giving a time average Poynting vec-
tor S = ˆx 1

. If the magnitudes of the

relative permittivity and permeability are chosen to be
identical, then unimpeded propagation takes place, i.e.,
there is no back-scattered wave.

The negative refractive index range, φn in [π/2, π], cor-

for the resonances in (4) and (5) deﬁne the frequencies

n = n′ + in′′. This means that with advancing time, the

based on power ﬂow, equivalent to the procedure used
in developing the Kramers-Kronig relations for permit-
tivity [11]. Note that conservation of energy is thus the
basic metric for causality, and others such as least time
based on phase (velocity), for example, Fermat’s least
time argument, require a revised interpretation from the
standard view for positive index materials.

The formalism developed here has direct application to
ferroelectric and ferromagnetic resonances as either the
electric dipole or the magnetic dipole source in a neg-
ative index material. A good metric for the resonance
frequency of ferromagnetics is the Bohr magneton di-
vided by Planck’s constant, which can conveniently be
written as
14 GHz/Tesla [9]. This places the possi-
ble range of resonance frequencies somewhere between 1
and 100 GHz. Ferroelectrics do not have such a conve-
nient metric, but the resonant frequencies tend to be in
10’s of THz [8]. Antiferromagnets can sometimes have
resonance frequencies near a THz, but they have rel-
ative susceptibilities similar to paramagnetic materials,
which are only slightly greater than unity. It may, how-
ever, still be possible to observe a negative index with an
antiferromagnetic-ferroelectric composite. Within their
respective frequency range, ferroelectrics and ferromag-
nets oﬀer very strong resonances, with susceptibilities ap-
proaching up to 10, 000 in both. The frequency range
over which the material may have a negative index is
given by the extent of the bandgap in the limiting ma-
terial, i.e., the one with the smallest bandgap, where the

bandgap is the region between the resonance frequency
(ω0) and it’s conjugate frequency (ω′) . In ferroelectrics,
the latter is given by the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation,
ω′2/ω2
0 = ε0/ε∞, where ω0 is the resonance frequency
usually associated with a transverse optical phonon in a
ferroelectric crystal, ε0 is the static dielectric constant
and ε∞ is the high frequency permittivity usually asso-
ciated with electronic resonances [8]. In ferromagnetics,
1), where µ∞ is the
the bandgap is equal to Ω0(µ∞ −
relative permeability above resonance [12]. These mate-
rials oﬀer an alternative to providing both electric and
magnetic resonances with a metamaterial. Furthermore,
ferromagnetic materials can be employed now with exist-
ing metamaterials that operate normally around 10 GHz.
One advantage in doing so is to exploit the modest tun-
ability of the ferromagnetic resonance and the associated
bandgap to provide a tunable negative index that could
possibly be used in a device, e.g., a switch that refracts
light one way or the other, based on the static magnetic
ﬁeld applied. Ferroelectrics also oﬀer beneﬁts for applica-
tion to existing THz frequency split ring resonators [13],
in that the electric ﬁeld of an electromagnetic wave can
be imaged directly as it propagates through the ferroelec-
tric material [14].

To summarize, by determining the path of stationary
phase for a stream of photons incident on an arbitrary
dispersive medium, we found that negative refraction oc-
curs when the index of refraction is negative, indicating
that the photons traverse this path with what seems to
be a negative phase velocity. While Fermat’s least time
principle correctly predicts Snell’s law for refraction at
an interface with a negative refractive index material, it
does not produce a least time solution, a consequence of

4

the negative phase velocity. The microscopic model we
have used for electric and magnetic dipole interactions
provides a basis for the collective oscillator phase shift
that results in negative phase velocity in the case of neg-
ative refractive index. We found that when the electric
and magnetic dipoles in this model have nearly the same
resonant frequency, the augmentation of the electric com-
ponent by the Lorentz dipoles is partially compensated
for by the Bloch dipoles acting on the magnetic compo-
nent, where the phase shifts in the electric and magnetic
components of the ﬁeld are directly related to the phase
of the microscopic electric and magnetic dipoles. While
any simultaneous resonance in the electric and magnetic
constitutive parameters can provide a model for nega-
tive refraction, the dilute microscopic interaction model
presented, and its generalization to the dense limit, pro-
vide a foundation for macroscopic interpretations. As
a consequence, it is clear that dispersion and loss can-
not be circumvented. Also, the dipole resonance models
presented have a ﬁnite bandgap that is representative of
physical systems such as ferroelectrics which can, with a
concomitant magnetic resonance bandgap, provide nega-
tive refractive index over a ﬁnite frequency range. While
there are ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials that
may be candidates for negative refractive index applica-
tions, achieving simultaneous bandgaps in an appropriate
frequency range and having other satisfactory properties,
such as low loss in the composite system, appears chal-
lenging. On the other hand, use of one or the other phys-
ical resonance, i.e., ferroelectric or ferromagnetic materi-
als, in combination with a metamaterial implementation
for the other resonance, is tractable and may yield prac-
tical functionalities.

Abstract

The Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem states that any optical element which contains no absorbing components
can be replaced by an equivalent optical model which consists of one linear retarder and one rotator only, both of
which are uniquely determined. This has many useful applications in the ﬁeld of Optics of Polarized Light.
In
particular, it arises naturally in attempts to reconstruct spatially varying refractive tensors or dielectric tensors from
measurements of the change of state of polarization of light beams passing through the medium, a ﬁeld which is
known as Tensor Tomography. A special case is Photoelasticity, where the internal stress of a transparent material
may be reconstructed from knowledge of the local optical tensors by using the stress-optical laws. – We present a
rigorous approach to the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem by explicitly proving a matrix decomposition theorem, from
which the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem follows as a corollary. To make the paper self-contained we supplement
a brief account of the Jones matrix formalism, at least as far as linear retarders and rotators are concerned. We
point out the connection between the parameters of the Poincar´e-equivalent model to previously introduced notions
of the Characteristic Parameters of an optical model in the engineering literature. Finally, we brieﬂy illustrate how
characteristic parameters and Poincar´e-equivalent models naturally arise in Photoelasticity.

1 Introduction

The propagation of an electromagnetic wave through a material medium is the result of the interaction between the
fundamental ﬁelds E and B with a macroscopic number of microscopic sources constituting the bulk matter. In principle,
these sources must be incorporated into the dynamics of the total system by appropriate interaction terms. However,
if the frequency bandwidth of the light under consideration is suﬃciently far away from the resonance frequencies of
the macroscopic medium, any photon-atom encounter is only transient; in this case we may refer to the medium as a
passive optical element. Its macroscopic eﬀect on impinging radiation may be summarized by introducing a (space- and
time-dependent) refractive index.

There are essentially two classes of such optical elements: Firstly, polarizers, which absorb, or at least attenuate, one of
two given orthogonal polarization forms of the light passing through the medium; and secondly, retarders, which introduce
a phase retardation between the components of these polarization forms, but otherwise preserve the total intensity of
the light. In principle, a polarized light beam can be analyzed with respect to any two orthogonal polarization forms.
However, in practice, two cases are of particular importance: The linear retarder, which introduces a phase lag between
the components of linearly analyzed light, and the rotator, which does the same with respect to the circularly polarized
components of a polarized light beam.

The description of the passage of light through optical elements depends on whether the light is polarized or not.
For unpolarized or partially polarized light, a description in terms of the Stokes parameters [1] (for a deﬁnition, see
e.g. [2]) is appropriate; if these are arranged into four-dimensional real vectors such that optical elements act on it by
means of real (4, 4) matrices we speak of the Mueller formalism [3, 4]. If, on the other hand, the light beam is completely
polarized, the polarization state of the transverse degrees of freedom of the electric ﬁeld can be conveniently arranged into
a two-dimensional complex vector, while optical elements now act on it by means of complex matrices. This formalism
is called the Jones calculus [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

∗email: H.Hammer@umist.ac.uk

Within the framework of the Jones calculus, polarizers are described by Hermitean matrices, while retarders are
represented by unitary ones. The latter reﬂects the fact that retarders preserve the total intensity of the light. The fact
that unitary matrices have the group property then implies that an arbitrary sequence of retarders is again described by
a unitary matrix. Such a sequence could be a pile of birefringent plates, each with constant rotation of principal axes and
constant phase retardation. But we can also consider the limit of inﬁnitely many, inﬁnitely thin, birefringent plates: This
situation describes a medium which exhibits a spatially varying dielectric tensor ǫij, or more generally, refractive tensor
nij. In this case, the phase velocity depends not only on the location within the medium, but also on the polarization
state of the (locally-plane) wave at this point. This corresponds to the most general case of an inhomogeneous anisotropic
medium.

Such a scenario arises naturally in the ﬁeld of Photoelasticity [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]: Experience shows that
certain materials, such as glasses and polymers, are optically isotropic and homogeneous when unloaded, but exhibit
local anisotropy when strained by an external load. The relation between the resulting dielectric tensor ǫij and the stress
tensor σij in the interior of the medium is called the stress-optical law; its basic form has been discovered long ago by
Maxwell [22]. Integrated Photoelasticity is concerned with the reconstruction of optical tensors, and via the stress-optical
law, of stress tensors, from data sets which are acquired by sending polarized light through the loaded specimen at many
diﬀerent angles, thereby measuring the change in the state of polarization. For this method to work, the material must
be suﬃciently transparent to ignore absorption within the medium. Since tensorial quantities are reconstructed, these
methods belong to the ﬁeld of Tensor Tomography.

In the examples above, the medium is given by a pile of retarders and/or rotators, possibly in the inﬁnitesimal
limit. The previous discussion implies that, within the Jones formalism, such a medium may be described by a unitary
(unimodular) matrix U . It turns out that such a matrix always determines – and, in turn, is fully determined by – a
set of characteristic directions [23] and a characteristic phase retardation between them. These characteristic parameters
[23] have been introduced within the context of Photoelasticity from an engineering point of view, and are not necessarily
standard in the mathematical literature [a rigorous mathematical deﬁnition will be given in section 3]. If the matrix U is
interpreted as belonging to an optical element of the kind as discussed above, the characteristic parameters can be given
an operational meaning: The primary characteristic directions determine those planes of linear polarization at the entry
into the medium for which the state of polarization at the emergence from the medium is again linear. The secondary
characteristic directions determine the planes of linear polarization of the emerging light, if the incident light was linearly
polarized in the primary characteristic directions; in general, they diﬀer from the primary ones. It turns out [sections
3, 6] that there are always two orthogonal primary and two orthogonal secondary characteristic directions. Light which
is linearly polarized along the two primary directions travels with diﬀerent phase velocities, though, so that both waves
emerge with a phase diﬀerence – the characteristic phase retardation.

It is an important task to reconstruct the optical properties of the medium, i.e. the matrix U , from measurements of
the characteristic parameters. To this end, relations between the parameters of a normal form of unitary matrices and
the characteristic parameters may be derived [19, 20, 23]. However, these relations only determine the squares of sines or
cosines of angles and therefore the actual computation of these quantities is rather involved. It is at this point where the
Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem [24] comes into play: This theorem states that any optical medium which is described by
a unitary unimodular matrix can be replaced by an optically equivalent model which consists of one retarder followed
by one rotator, or the other way round; in each case, both elements are uniquely determined. Then it can be shown
easily that the characteristic parameters of the optical medium coincide with the optical parameters of the equivalent
model, i.e. with the principal directions and phase retardation for the equivalent retarder, and the rotation angle for
the equivalent rotator; but from the latter, the matrix U may readily be determined completely. This reconstruction
becomes particularly important in the case of tensor tomography of photoelastic media, where the overall eﬀect of the
specimen on the passage of light represents the accumulated eﬀect of many (inﬁnitesimal) retarders and rotators.

These examples highlight the importance of the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem in the ﬁeld of Optics of Polarized
Light. Although references to the equivalence theorem, or applications thereof, are made frequently in the literature
[17, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26], its precise content is apparently not widely published; a rigorous proof of the theorem, or some
equivalent statement thereof, seems even less readily available. This observation constitutes the starting point of our
paper: We rigorously prove a matrix decomposition theorem for unitary unimodular (2, 2) matrices [section 4], from
which the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem follows as a corollary [section 5]. To put this result into a context, and to
make the paper reasonably self-contained, we provide a brief overview of the description of polarized light, and optical
elements acting on it, in terms of the Jones calculus; this is done in section 2. The second objective of this paper is to
clarify the relation between the (operationally deﬁned) characteristic parameters of a transparent model according to
Aben [19, 20, 23], and the optical parameters of the Poincar´e-equivalent model. To this end we recapitulate in section 3
the notions of characteristic directions and characteristic phase retardation for non-absorbing optical elements. We also
prove the existence of characteristic directions for any unitary unimodular (2, 2) matrix in a standard parametrisation.
The relation between characteristic parameters and the parameters of the Poincar´e-equivalent retarder and rotator then
are analyzed in section 6. Finally, in section 7 we outline the basic ideas of three-dimensional photoelasticity in order
to illustrate the context in which a specimen with continuous variation of optical tensors presents itself, and how the
Poincar´e-equivalent model may be important to the objective of tensor tomography. In section 8 we summarize our

results.

2 Polarized Light in the Jones Matrix Formalism

In this paper we only consider completely polarized classical light. Strictly speaking, this is an idealization, which can
be approximately realized only if 1) the light is strictly monochromatic, and 2) the complex degree of coherence [2] of
two orthogonal components of the electric ﬁeld always has unit modulus. Physically, this means that the two orthogonal
components have a well-deﬁned and constant phase relation for all times.

The transverse electric ﬁeld of a general eliptically polarized light beam propagating in the 3-direction takes the form

E(x, t) = a1 cos (kz

ωt + δ1) e1 + a2 cos (kz

ωt + δ2) e2

,

−

−

where a1, a2 are real amplitudes, u = ω/k is the phase velocity in the (isotropic and homogeneous) medium, δ1 and δ2
are constant phases, and e1 and e2 are real unit vectors in the direction of the x- and y-axes. Since the action of optical
elements on light beams is accomplished by linear transformations, it is admissible to assume that the beam has unit
relative intensity [18] a2
2 = 1. We now choose a ﬁxed location within the beam, say, z = 0, and express (1) as the
real part of the complex vector

1 + a2

E = e−iωt

a1 eiδ1 e1 + a2 eiδ2 e2

.

The quantity in curly brackets deﬁnes the polarization form of the light; the associated complex 2-vector
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

vl =

,

(cid:18)
is called the Jones vector of the light beam with respect to linear polarization along the directions e1 and e2. We use a
subscript l to denote the fact that the Jones vector (3) denotes linearly polarized components.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

As can be seen, the Jones vector is deﬁned only up to a global phase, i.e. Jones vectors v and eiΦv are equivalent,

since the global phase Φ can always be reabsorbed into the total phase e−iωt governing the time dynamics.

Eq. (2) represents the decomposition of the (complex form of the) electric ﬁeld vector into two linearly polarized
components whose amplitudes are a1, a2, and whose relative phase is δ
δ1. This decomposition is convenient to
derive the Jones matrix of a linear retarder. To study the rotator it is necessary to analyze the light with respect to
complex basis vectors e+ and e− which represent right-handed and left-handed circular polarization, respectively, which
are deﬁned as

δ2

[We recall that right-handed = left-circular, and vice versa]. The electric ﬁeld vector (2) can be expanded in terms of
the basis (e+, e−),

such that the components v+ and v− make up the Jones vector vc of the light in the basis (4),

We use a subscript c to point out that the Jones vector (6) denotes circularly polarized components.

Evidently, the matrix M mapping the basis vectors (e1, e2) for linear polarization to those (e+, e−) for circular
polarization is unitary. Indeed, this is true for any transformation between basis vectors of diﬀerent polarization forms.

We are now in a position to derive the Jones matrices for linear retarders and rotators.

2.1 The linear retarder in the Jones calculus

A linear retarder is an optical element made of a material which exhibits homogeneous optical anisotropy along a given
direction of light transmission [2, 17, 18]. Perpendicular to the direction of passage of light, the retarder has two distinct
orthogonal directions, called the fast and the slow axis, respectively. The phase velocity of a plane wave which is linearly
polarized along the fast axis is greater than for waves polarized along the slow axis. This means that, at the point of

(1)

emergence from the retarder, the component along the slow axis (”slow component”) has acquired a phase lag δ with
respect to the component along the fast axis (”fast component”). Let us assume that the fast/slow axis is oriented along
the x/y-axis. If the Jones vector of light prior to entry into the retarder is

then after emergence from the retarder it has changed to

v =

,

c1

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

v′ = eiΦg

eiδ c2

.

(cid:18)
The exponential eiδ indeed represents a phase lag of the local harmonic oscillator at z = 0 vibrating in the y-direction,
because of our convention to count the phase of the time dynamics as e−iωt. Furthermore, Φg represents a global phase
which is picked up by any wave passing through the retarder, irrespective of its polarization form. Since global phases
are immaterial in our present discussion, it is common to adjust them for maximum convenience, or otherwise discard
them altogether, which is what we shall do throughout. Physically, a global change of phase could be accomplished by
passage of the light through an isotropic medium whose optical path length corresponds to the desired phase diﬀerence.

(cid:19)

Since the global phase in (8) can be chosen freely, we may extract and discard a global phase Φg = delta

, in which

case the transformed Jones vector reads

It is now clear that the matrix which accomplishes the transformation v

Our notation Jlin(0, δ) reﬂects the fact that the phase diﬀerence between the components is δ, while the angle between
the fast axis and the x-direction is θ = 0.

It is easy to derive the Jones matrix Jlin(θ, δ) of a linear retarder whose fast axis makes a nonvanishing angle with

the x-axis. To this end we introduce the rotation matrix

This is an SO(2)-matrix representing a passive rotation by θ about the z-axis, that is to say, the basis vectors and vector
components transform according to

The group property implies that a succession of two rotations is again a rotation; furthermore, two rotations around the
same axis commute. Thus we have

R(θ1 + θ2) = R(θ1) R(θ2) = R(θ2) R(θ1)

.

Using the rotation matrices it is easy to derive the Jones matrix Jlin(θ, δ) for a linear retarder with nonvanishing angle
θ: We only need to keep in mind that in the reference frame of the fast (e′
2) axes, the retarder must act
with a Jones matrix (10) on the components v′

Equation (15) is indeed valid for Jones matrices J of arbitrary optical devices whose preferred axes are related
by an orthogonal transformation, since all we have used in the derivation of (15) was the law of passive coordinate
transformations onto a coordinate system whose axes coincided with the preferred axes of the optical device.

We note that the Jones matrices of the linear retarder, (10) and (15), are unitary unimodular matrices, since we have

chosen the global phase Φg in (10) in such a way that det Jlin(0, δ) = 1.

2.2 The rotator in the Jones calculus

The rotator is an optical element which introduces a phase lag δ of the left-handed relative to the right-handed component
of the complex electric ﬁeld vector (2). If the electric ﬁeld is expanded in terms of the basis (4), the left-handed / right-
handed components are just the elements v− and v+ in the Jones vector vc given in eq. (6). Thus, after passage through
the rotator we have

Evidently, the linear map which accomplishes the transformation (17) is precisely the matrix Jlin(0, δ) of the linear
retarder given in (10); thus, in the basis (4) we simply have

vc =

c = Jlin(0, δ) vc

.

Using eq. (6) which eﬀects the transformation between the components for linear and circular polarization, we can easily
transform eq. (18) back into the Cartesian frame (e1, e2), in which the Jones vector is given by (3),

This determines the Jones matrix Jrot(

δ
2 ) of the rotator in the Cartesian basis,

where the rotation matrix R was deﬁned in (11).

The reason for our seemingly strange notation convention becomes clear if we recall that a positive phase lag of the
left-handed component with respect to the right-handed component should rotate the plane of polarization of a linearly
polarized light beam in a counter-clockwise sense; this is a positive angle + delta
in the xy-plane, if we look into the
oncoming wave, i.e. from positive towards negative z-values. It is easy to check this:

Here, [cos θ, sin θ]T is the Jones vector of a normalized, linearly polarized beam, and θ is the initial angle of inclination
of the plane of polarization. After passage through the rotator, the plane of polarization has rotated by +δ/2.

This ﬁnishes our discussion of linear retarders and rotators in the Jones calculus.

3 Characteristic parameters of SU (2) matrices

As mentioned in the Introduction, the terms ’Characteristic Directions’, ’Characteristic Phase Diﬀerence’ and ’Charac-
teristic Parameters’ were ﬁrst introduced by Aben within the framework of Photoelasticity [23]. We now wish to explain
their meaning.

Consider a non-absorbing optical medium whose Jones matrix U is unitary. If U happens to have a determinant
diﬀerent from 1, we can always extract and discard a global phase, so that U may be assumed to be unimodular,
det U = 1, and hence an element of SU (2). A parametrisation of SU (2) matrices is given by [27]

This parametrisation is unique in the interior of the interval [0, π
2 . If θ takes one of the boundary values,
parts of the parameter space must undergo identiﬁcation in order to make the map between parameters and matrices
unique: For θ = 0 we must identify points (θ, φ, χ) = (0, 0, χ), χ
2 , φ, 0),
φ

[0, 2π), must be identiﬁed. This agreement makes the mapping between parameter space and matrices bijective.

If the replacements (32) are used in (25) we obtain (27), again under the conditions (29). — It is easy to check that,
whenever one of the values in (29) is taken, the right-hand sides in both (25) and (27) are ill-deﬁned. — This ﬁnishes
(cid:4)
the proof.

The physical meaning of this is as follows: The existence of two solutions for (24) implies that there exist two
perpendicular directions for the plane of linearly polarized light, given by the solutions (23), such that if light polarized
in this direction enters the device it will emerge linearly polarized again; this is a consequence of the fact that the
components of the transformed Jones vector have the same overall phase. This statement is true only for the light as it
emerges behind the apparatus; in the interior of the device, the light is elliptically polarized in general. Furthermore, the
phase velocity of a linearly polarized wave entering the device at the angle γ1 diﬀers from the one entering at γ2, so that
both waves will emerge with a phase diﬀerence ∆, see eq. (36) below.

We now turn to the determination of the phases Φm in (24). We ﬁnd

Proof:

We perform the matrix multiplication U wm with the form (22) for U , but the angles γm need not be known explicitly.
On the right-hand side of this equation we have eiΦm w′
m. We now expand this equation into real and imaginary parts,
obtaining two equations which on their right-hand sides contain cos Φm w′ and sin Φm w′, respectively. If the component
equations are squared and added, we obtain the relations (33a, 33b). To arrive at (33c), we divide (33a) by (33b) and
(cid:4)
then divide the whole equation by a common factor cos2 θ. Subtracting (33b) from (33a) then yields (34).

It is important to point out that the phase changes Φm in general do not coincide with the real phases of the light
as it passes through the real device, for in the latter case there is also an additional global phase which is accumulated
by any light beam that travels through the apparatus. This global phase has been discarded in the construction of the
Jones matrices of the retarder and the rotator, in order to make these matrices unimodular. However, the global phase
is the same for light of any polarization form, and therefore cancels out if we construct the phase diﬀerence between
light beams which enter the device along the primary characteristic directions. This phase diﬀerence does not depend
on unobservable parameters and can therefore be measured. In principle, it can be evaluated from (33c): This equation
has four solutions, given by

At this point a remark concerning the results (28) and (36) are in order:

∆ = 2Φ2 mod π .

1 or w′

Eq. (27) determines the directions of polarization of the emerging light. However, it does not determine whether
U w1 is equal to w′
2, and similarly for U w2. This is reﬂected in the indeterminacy of the phase diﬀerence in
(36): The modulus of ∆ is determined only up to π, while the sign is undetermined.
It is at this point where the
decomposition theorem 4.1 and the ensuing Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem prove very useful, since they allow to remove
this indeterminacy completely, provided the measurements on the sample are capable of distinguishing between the fast
and the slow axis of the equivalent retarder [see sections 5, 6].

For every optical device described by a unitary unimodular matrix U , the set of quantities (γ1, γ′

1, ∆), are called the

characteristic parameters of the model.

4 Matrix Equivalence and the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem

In theorem 4.1 we show that every two-dimensional unitary unimodular matrix U has a unique decomposition in terms
of a minimal number of ’basic building blocks’. There are two of these building blocks: The ﬁrst is given by the rotation
matrices R(ξ) as deﬁned in (11); the second is given by diagonal unitary unimodular matrices

Proof:

We ﬁrst must conﬁrm that the right-hand sides of (39a, 40a, 41a) indeed lie in SU (2). But this is clear, since the
adjoints of these matrices are equal to their inverses, and the determinant is equal to one in each case. So, we know that
these matrices comprise a subset of SU (2); but we do not yet know whether this subset comprises the whole of SU (2).
This is what we are going to show next.

To this end we ﬁrst focus on decompositions in terms of three matrices, (39a). Let (θ, φ, χ) be a parameter triple
pertaining to a given form (22). If a decomposition (39a) of U exists, there must exist a triple (α, β, δ) such that the real
and imaginary parts of each component of the matrices (22) and (39c) coincide. This yields four equations

We now show that the system (42) is indeed solvable for the triple (α, β, δ), and that the solution is unique under the
circumstances described in case I.) – III.) above.

We ﬁrst examine case I.):

which determines tan δ up to a sign from known quantities φ, χ and θ. However, we require [see (38)] that sin α, sin β
always be nonnegative. Then the second equation in (43) implies that the sign of tan δ is the negative of the sign of
tan χ. Thus, δ is determined up to multiples of π. Now, since sin β must be nonnegative, eq. (42b) determines the sign
of cos δ, and therefore δ is uniquely determined in [0, 2π).

Now that δ is determined, α and β are uniquely determined by the system (42). In fact they are determined to lie in
sin β in (43) for the determination

0 as well as the positivity of sin α

Since none of sin φ, cos φ is zero, eqs. (45a) and (45c) imply that sin δ, cos δ
= 0. But then eqs. (45b), (45d) imply that
sin α = sin β = 0, and due to (38) it follows that α = β = 0. In this case, (45a) and (45c) imply that δ = φ. This gives
the minimal decomposition (40a), which coincides with form (39a) for the choice of parameters (40b).

Now we brieﬂy discuss the cases where φ

three matrices for β
minimal decomposition which is unique if β is restricted [eq. (38)] to lie in the admissible range [0, π). This choice of
parameters coincides with (40b), and the resulting form for U coincides with (40a).

Analogously, for sin φ = 0 we have the decomposition

U = R(

with β = 0 and α left unspeciﬁed. For general α, (46b) provides a decomposition in terms of three matrices. A minimal
decomposition, in terms of one matrix only, is obtained for the choice α = 0, which is unique again, since α is restricted
to lie in [0, π). Again, the parameter values α = β = 0 corresponding to the minimal decomposition coincide with (40b),
and the resulting minimal form is (40a).

5 The Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem

We are now in a position to deduce the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem from our decomposition theorem 4.1. Let us
assume that U is the Jones matrix of a non-absorbing optical medium. As discussed before, U is unitary and may be
assumed to be unimodular, possibly after discarding a global phase. Then U has a unique decomposition (39a) or (40a)
or (41a). For the purposes of the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem, we use the decomposition (39a) in terms of three
matrices, so that

and it is understood that ξ and ζ are always chosen according to the minimal decompositions (39a, 40b, 41b). In the
next step we take into account that the diagonal matrix D(δ) is formally identical to the Jones matrix of a linear retarder
with fast axis along the x-direction and a phase lag of

2δ of the slow with respect to the fast axis,

according to (10). We can now rewrite (49) as

From the proof of theorem 4.1 we know that the decompositions (52, 53) are unique provided that the parameters

(θ, φ, χ) in the parametrisation (22) of U are restricted according to (29).

If one of the parameter sets in (29) is taken, the matrices in (49) are no longer uniquely determined. From the proof
of theorem 4.1 we know that in these cases either α or β remains unspeciﬁed. However, the phase retardation ∆ =
2δ
is always well-deﬁned. It is easy to translate the condition that (θ, φ) or (θ, χ) take one of the values in (29a, 29b),
respectively, into a condition for the optical parameters of the linear retarder and rotator in eqs. (53). This can be done
with the help of (46a, 46b, 48a, 48b), or also (40a) and (41a). It is easy to check that the decomposition is non-unique
if and only if the phase retardation ∆ of the linear retarder in the equivalent optical model is an even or odd integer
multiple of π. Physically this means that the retarder in these cases can be realized by a stack of half-wave plates.

−

In eqs. (52), (53) we have proven the

Theorem 5.1 (Poincare Equivalence Theorem). For every non-absorbing passive optical medium (represented by
a unimodular unitary matrix) there exists an optically equivalent model which is built from one linear retarder and one
rotator only. These elements may be arranged in any order, and in both cases the phase lag ∆ =

2δ is the same.

−

If ∆ is not a multiple of π, α and β are uniquely determined.

If ∆ is a multiple of π (corresponding to a stack of half-wave plates), one of the angles α or β is left unspeciﬁed.
However, α and β may still be chosen according to (40b) and (41b), corresponding to the minimal decompositions (40a)
and (41a).

6 Relation between Characteristic Parameters and the Poincar´e-Equivalent

Model

In section 3 we have shown that every optical device which (in the framework of Jones calculus) can be represented
by a unitary unimodular (2, 2) matrix U possesses two orthogonal directions, w1 and w2, such that linearly polarized
light whose plane of polarization on entry into the apparatus is w1 or w2 will emerge linearly polarized again, with
polarization directions w′
2. Furthermore, we saw that linearly polarized light entering at the two primary
characteristic directions emerges with diﬀerent phases; an expression for the relative phase diﬀerence was given in (36),
but we were not able to determine it uniquely.

1 and w′

On the other hand, in theorem 5.1 we showed that every such device was optically equivalent to a succession of
linear retarders and rotators. Since a linear retarder has two preferred spatial directions (the fast and slow axis) and a
well-deﬁned phase retardation between them, this suggests that the characteristic directions might be closely related to
the fast and slow axes, while the phase diﬀerence (36) might be identiﬁed with the retardation of the retarder.

We now show that this is indeed so: We ﬁrst treat the unique cases, i.e. parameters (θ, φ, χ) satisfy (29), or
equivalently, the phase lag ∆ =
In this case the linear
retarder has precisely two preferred directions, namely the fast and slow optical axis. Only at these directions preserves
the linear retarder the state of linear polarization; any other direction of linear polarization on entry will emerge as
elliptical polarization form. On using the decomposition (49) it is then clear that the primary characteristic directions
are determined by the condition

2δ of the equivalent linear retarder is not a multiple of π.

The arguments leading to eqs. (55–59) clearly are based on intuition rather than rigorous derivation. In order to
be rigorous we have to show that these equations are consistent with the results of theorems 3.1, 3.2 and eq. (36) in
section 3. More precisely, we must show that the angles γm as deﬁned in (57a) satisfy the equations (25), while γ′
m as
deﬁned in (57b) must satisfy (27). This can be done easily, on using the assumption that parameters (θ, φ, χ) satisfy
(29): To show that the ﬁrst statement is true it is suﬃcient to expand tan(α
β) in terms of sines, cosines of α and β,
and multiply both nominator and denumerator of the resulting fraction with cos δ sin δ; it is at this point where we need
the condition that cos δ, sin δ
= 0. The result can be easily recast in the form of eq. (25). The second statement linking
(57b) to (27) is conﬁrmed in the same way. Finally, eqs. (33a, 33b) can be derived immediately from the system (42).
We note that we have removed the indeterminacy concerning the assignment between Φm and
δ by decreeing that the
subscript 1 should refer to the fast axis of the equivalent retarder. This assignment is now well-justiﬁed since it is based

on the distinction between diﬀerent values of a physically measurable quantity, namely the phase velocity along the axes.
Previously, in section 3, we did not yet possess the physical justiﬁcation for such a deliberate choice.

We now turn to discuss the non-unique decompositions: From section 5 we know that in these cases the phase
retardation of the equivalent linear retarder is always a multiple of π; in particular, it is always well-deﬁned. What is left
∈ Z, the retarder transforms
unspeciﬁed is one of the angles α, β. This is physically reasonable, for, whenever ∆ = kπ, k
any linearly polarized light into linearly polarized light again, and hence any direction (before entry into the medium) is
a primary characteristic direction (and any direction behind the medium is a secondary one). This is clearly consistent
with the eqs. (25, 27): In the comment following (29) we remarked that (25, 27) remained ill-deﬁned if parameter values
(29) were taken. This simply means that there are no preferred directions in this case, and any two orthogonal directions
before and behind the medium may serve as primary and secondary characteristic directions.

We ﬁnish this section by writing down the decompositions (53) of the equivalent optical model in terms of the

characteristic parameters: In the case of unique decompositions, eqs. (49) and (53) read

7 Basic Ideas of Integrated Photoelasticity

In this section we want to outline, in a single paragraph, how optical media with spatially dependent dielectric tensors
naturally emerge in Photoelasticity.

Consider a medium (such as glass or certain polymers) which is optically homogeneous and isotropic, with a dielectric
tensor ǫδij when strain-free, but which becomes inhomogeneous and anisotropic when subject to an external load. The
dielectric tensor ǫij then is related to the stress tensor σij of the material according to the stress-optical law

ǫij = ǫ δij + C1 σij + C2 tr(σ) δij

,

i, j = 1, 2, 3 ,

(61)

where C1, C2 are stress-optical constants. The medium is assumed to occupy a bounded region in space. Polarized light
is sent through the specimen at many diﬀerent angles, and from the change of the state of polarization the characteristic
parameters of the model, for a given direction of the incident light beam, are retrieved. Light is assumed to propagate
through the medium along straight lines, an approximation which is acceptable as long as the stress-induced birefringence
is weak. Under these circumstances, the Maxwell equations describing the propagation of a plane wave with locally varying
state of polarization along the z-direction of the medium can be cast into the form

the components of the projection of the local dielectric tensor onto the xy-plane, at position (x, y, z). The point (x, y) in
the xy-plane characterizes the location of entry of the light beam (which is assumed to have very small diameter) into
the medium. Eqs. (62) may be expressed in an equivalent way by introducing a unitary propagation matrix U (z) such
that

where zi is any point before the medium. This matrix must satisfy a diﬀerential equation analogous to (62),

v(z) = U (z, zi) v(zi)

,

d
dz

U (z, zi) = H(z) U (z, zi)

,

where the matrix H is given on the right-hand side of (62). If zf is a point behind the medium, the matrix U (zf , zi) is
obtained by integrating (64); it determines the change of polarization form of the light beam passing through the medium
between points (x, y, zi) and (x, y, zf ) along a straight line. Measurements of this change in the polarization determine
the characteristic parameters, and in turn, the equivalent model in either of the forms (60), for the given ray of light.
Repeating the procedure for many rays at diﬀerent angles yields data sets which contain the characteristic parameters
for any possible direction of the light beam. From these data we attempt to reconstruct the local dielectric tensor in the
interior of the medium. This problem, called three-dimensional Photoelasticity, is still unsolved in its most general form,
and the Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem as given in one of the forms above may play an important role in this goal.

8 Summary

In this paper we have proven a decomposition theorem for two-dimensional unitary unimodular matrices which represent
a non-absorbing passive optical medium in the framework of the Jones calculus. From this decomposition theorem, the
Poincar´e Equivalence Theorem can be derived as a corollary. The latter states that every non-absorbing optical medium
is optically equivalent to a succession of linear retarders and rotators, in any order. Except for few cases, the equivalent
linear retarder and rotator are uniquely determined from data characterizing the original medium. We have shown
that the parameters of these equivalent elements have a simple interpretation in terms of measurable quantities, the
so-called Characteristic Parameters of an optical model, which have been known in the engineering literature for some
time. The relation between these Characteristic Parameters and the Poincar´e-equivalent optical model has been fully
clariﬁed. Finally, we have illustrated the context in which the Poincar´e-equivalent model is expected to become a useful
tool: Within the framework of three-dimensional Photoelasticity, the decomposition theorems proven in this paper may
turn out to be important to the goal of reconstructing local dielectric tensors from measurements of the global change
of the polarization state of light transmitted through an inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium with spatially varying
refractive tensor.

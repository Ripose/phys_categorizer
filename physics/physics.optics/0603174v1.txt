The ﬁlamentational instability of spatially broadband femtosecond optical pulses

in air is investigated by means of a kinetic wave equation for spatially incoherent

photons. An explicit expression for the spatial ampliﬁcation rate is derived and

analyzed. It is found that the spatial spectral broadening of the pulse can lead to

stabilization of the ﬁlamentation instability. Thus, optical smoothing techniques

could optimize current applications of ultra-short laser pulses, such as atmospheric

remote sensing.

Recently, there has been a great deal of interest1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 in investigating the nonlinear propa-

gation of optical pulses in air. In order for the pulse propagation over a long distance, it is necessary

to avoid ﬁlamentational instabilities that grow in space. Filamentation instabilities of optical pulses

occur in nonlinear dispersive media, where the medium index of refraction depends on the pulse

intensity. This happens in nonlinear optics (viz. a nonlinear Kerr medium) where a small modula-

tion of the optical pulse amplitudes can grow in space due to the ﬁlamentation instability arising

from the interplay between the medium nonlinearity and the pulse dispersion/diffraction. The ﬁl-

amentational instability is responsible for the break up of pulses into light pipes. It is, therefore,

quite important to look for mechanisms that contribute to the nonlinear stability of optical pulses in

nonlinear dispersive media. One possibility would be to use optical pulses that have ﬁnite spectral

bandwidth, since the latter can signiﬁcantly reduce the growth rate of the ﬁlamentation instabil-

ity. Physically, this happens because of the distribution of the optical pulse intensity over a broad

spectrum, which is unable to drive the ﬁlamentation instability with fuller efﬁciency, contrary to

a coherent pulse which has a delta-function spectrum. In this Letter, we present for the ﬁrst time

a theoretical study of the ﬁlamentation instability of partially coherent optical pulses in air. We

show that the spatial ampliﬁcation rate of the ﬁlamentation instability is signiﬁcantly reduced by

means of spatial spectral broadening of optical pulses. The present results could be of signiﬁcance

in applications using ultra-short pulses for remote sensing of the near Earth atmosphere.

The dynamics of coherent femtosecond optical pulses with a weak group velocity dispersion in

air is governed by the modiﬁed nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation4,5,9,10,11

(for a discussion of the approximations leading to Eq. (1), we refer to 9). We note that Eq. (1) has

been used in Ref. 11 to analyze the multi-ﬁlamentation of optical beams.

Following Ref. 12, we can derive a wave kinetic equation that governs the nonlinear propa-

gation intense optical pulses which have a spectral broadening in space. Accordingly, we apply
the Wigner-Moyal transform method13,14,15,16. The multi-dimensional Wigner-Moyal transform,

including the Klimontovich statistical average, is deﬁned as

r (z, r⊥, p) =

d2x eip·ξhy ∗(z, r⊥ + ξ/2)y (z, r⊥ − ξ/2)i,

the ensemble average17. The pulse intensity h|y

d2p r (z, r⊥, p).

(3)

Applying the transformation (2) on Eq. (2), we obtain the Wigner-Moyal kinetic equation14,15,16,18

Seeking the solution ¯r = ¯r (z, p) to Eq. (4), we may write ¯r (z, p) = r 0(p) ¯I(z), where r 0 is

is to introduce a
slow fall-off in the intensity along the z-direction when K ≥ 1. Moreover, as n → 0 this solution
reduces to ¯I = I0.

We now consider spatial ﬁlamentation of a well deﬁned optical pulses against small perturba-

tions having the parallel wavenumber kk and the perpendicular wavevector k⊥, by assuming that
is small so that kk ≫ |¶ z| for the background distribution. We let r = ¯r (z, p) + r 1(p) exp(ikkz +

ik⊥ · r⊥) + c.c. and I = ¯I(z) + I1 exp(ikkz + ik⊥ · r⊥) + c.c., where |r 1| ≪ ¯r , |I1| ≪ ¯I, and c.c.
stands for the complex conjugate. We linearize (4) with respect to the perturbation variables and

readily obtain the nonlinear dispersion equation

kk + 2k⊥ · p − 2in ¯IK−1

, (5)

which is valid for partially coherent femtosecond pulses in air. Here the prime denotes differenti-
ation with respect to the background intensity ¯I.

We simplify the analysis by assuming that the perpendicular dependence in essence is one-

dimensional. In the coherent case, i.e. ¯r (z, p) = ¯I(z)d (p − p0), Eq. (5) yields

kk = −2kp0 + in (K + 1) ¯IK−1 ±

k2[k2 − 2 f ′( ¯I) ¯I] − n 2(K − 1)2 ¯I2K−2,

where k represents the perpendicular wavenumber in the one-dimensional case. Letting kk =

which reduces to the well known ﬁlamentation instability growth rate in a Kerr medium (i.e. n = 0
and f (I) = a I). We note that a nonzero n gives rise to an overall reduction of the growth rate. In

Fig. 1 we have plotted a number of different curves for the growth rate in the coherent case.

In the partially coherent case, we investigate the effects of spatial spectral broadening using the

Lorentz distribution

¯r (z, p) =

where D denotes the width of the distribution around the quasiparticle momenta p0. Inserting (8)
into (5) and carrying out the integration in a straightforward manner, we obtain

kk = −2kp0 + in (K + 1) ¯IK−1 + 2ikD ±

k2[k2 − 2 f ′( ¯I) ¯I] − n 2(K − 1)2 ¯I2K−2.

With kk = −2kp0 − iG

the ﬁlamentation instability growth rate is

k2[2 f ′( ¯I) ¯I − k2] + n 2(K − 1)2 ¯I2K−2.

(10)

In the limit D → 0, Eq. (9) reduces to the dispersion relation (6), while for n = 0 the dispersion

relation (9) reduces to the standard expression for the ﬁlamentation instability growth rate

In Fig. 2 we have displayed the ﬁlamentation instability growth rate (10). The effect of the ﬁnite
width D of the quasiparticle distribution can clearly be seen. In particular, multi-photon absorption
(here chosen to be a modest K = 3), determined by the coefﬁcient n , as well as multi-photon
ionization, represented by the coefﬁcient g , combined with ﬁnite spectral width of the optical pulse

give rise to a signiﬁcant reduction of the ﬁlamentation instability growth rate. This is evident from

Fig. 2, where the plotted normalized growth rate is reduced by as much as a factor of six, compared

to the case of full coherence.

In practice, optical smoothing techniques, such as the use of random phase plates20 or other

random phase techniques well suited for the results in the present Letter, have been used in inertial

conﬁnement fusion studies for quite some time (see, e.g. Ref. 21). Such spatial partial coherence

controls are reproducible and can be tailored as to give a suitable broadband spectrum (as in, e.g.

22, where optical vortices were generated). Thus, in the case of ultra-short pulse propagation in air,

such random phase techniques can be used to experimentally prepare an ultra-short optical pulse

for a long-distance propagation, and a large spatial bandwidth of optical pulses, in conjunction

with multi-photon ionization and absorption, may drastically reduce (down to less than 20 % of

4

D
the coherent value in the present study) the ﬁlamentation instability growth rate. This will lead

to a greater long range stability, since the onset of strong optical pulse ﬁlamentation is delayed,

resulting in several times longer stable propagation. A rough estimate based on the numbers found

in the present Letter shows that an optical beam could propagate a distance as much as six times

longer with proper random phasing.

To summarize, we have investigated the ﬁlamentation instability of partially coherent fem-

tosecond optical pulses in air. For this purpose, we introduced the Wigner-Moyal representation

on the modiﬁed nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation and obtained a kinetic wave equation for optical

pulses that have a spectral bandwidth in wavevector space. A perturbation analysis of the kinetic

wave equation gives a nonlinear dispersion relation, which describes the ﬁlamentation instability

(spatial ampliﬁcation) of broadband optical pulses. Our results reveal that the latter would not be

subjected to ﬁlamentation due to spectral pulse broadening. Hence, using partial spatial coherence

effects for controlling the ﬁlamentational instability, femtosecond optical pulse propagation in air

can be improved signiﬁcantly. The result presented here is also indicative that optical smooth-

ing techniques, as used in inertial conﬁnement studies, could be very useful for ultra-short pulse

propagation in air. This can help to optimize current applications of ultra-short laser pulses for

atmospheric remote sensing over a long distance.

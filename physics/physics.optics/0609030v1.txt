Debye representation of dispersive focused waves

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We report on a matrix-based diﬀraction integral that evaluates the focal ﬁeld of any diﬀraction-
limited axisymmetric complex system. This diﬀraction formula is a generalization of the Debye
integral applied to apertured focused beams, which may be accommodated to broadband problems.
Longitudinal chromatic aberration may limit the convenience of the Debye formulation and, ad-
ditionally, spatial boundaries of validity around the focal point are provided. Fresnel number is
reformulated in order to guarantee that the focal region is entirely into the region of validity of
the Debye approximation when the Fresnel number of the focusing geometry largely exceeds unity.
We have applied the matrix-based Debye integral to several examples. Concretely, we present an
optical system for beam focusing with strong angular dispersion and free of longitudinal chromatic
aberration. This simple formalism leaves an open door for analysis and design of focused beams
with arbitrary angular dispersion. Our results are valid for ultrashort pulsed and polychromatic
incoherent sources.

INTRODUCTION

transfer matrix theory [18].

Interaction of high-intense ultrashort pulsed radia-
tion with matter enhances multiphoton ionization [1, 2],
high-harmonic generation [3, 4], and supercontinuum
formation[5, 6]. The above experimental demonstrations
give rise to signiﬁcant applications such as multiphoton
excitation ﬂuorescence imaging [7] and high-harmonic
microscopy [8, 9], where microscopic structures of trans-
parent samples may be probed in the vicinity of the focus
of a tightly focused beam. Such broadband radiation has
intrinsically a serious sensitivity to temporal dispersion
and chromatic aberrations [10, 11]. Consequently, spatio-
temporal control of broadband light focusing is manda-
tory.

Some authors have demonstrated simultaneous spatial
and temporal focusing of femtosecond pulses by means of
waveﬁeld division [12, 13]. This technique is based on the
spatial separation of the spectral components of pulses
into a collection of oﬀ-axis beams, also called “rainbow
beam”, thus allowing a parallel processing, and recombin-
ing these components at the focal point of an achromatic
objective lens. The proposed arrangements incorporate
diﬀractive gratings, frequently combined with refractive
prisms, with speciﬁc dispersive behavior. Similarly, gen-
eration of multiple spots in the back focal plane of a lens
results in a notable energy dispersion, and some pro-
posals with spatial-dispersion compensation properties
have been presented elsewhere [14, 15]. Interestingly, the
diﬀraction gratings may be appropriately substituted by
Fresnel lenses for spatial dispersion compensation of in-
coherent white light [16, 17], proﬁting from the inherent
radial symmetry of these optical elements. A complete
system design may be performed in terms of the ABCD

The focal region is extensively analyzed in the litera-
ture under the assumption that the incoming spherical
wave is monochromatic and the beam is tightly focused
such that the Fresnel number of the focusing arrangement
is high [19, 20]. The Fresnel number of the apertured fo-
cusing lens, N = a2/λf , depends on the aperture radius,
a, the lens focal length, f , and the radiation wavelength,
λ. In a general diﬀraction problem, the Kirchhoﬀ diﬀrac-
tion theory should be used. However, when the Fresnel
number is much higher than unity, some spatial symme-
tries in the vicinity of focus are found, and the Debye
approximation holds [21, 22]. By the way, the concept of
Fresnel number has recently been interpreted for broad-
band coherent radiation [23]. However, roughly speaking,
the Debye diﬀraction formulation has been ignored in the
evaluation of the focal ﬁeld of polychromatic (both ultra-
short pulsed and temporally incoherent) spherical waves.
Only a few studies have taken into account the aforemen-
tioned approximation [24, 25, 26, 27].

In the transfer matrix theory, the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ in-
tegral is expressed in terms of the Collins formula [28],
which proves to be a powerful tool for system analysis and
design [29, 30]. Obviously, we may include the analysis
of either monochromatic or polychromatic focal waves
of complex optical systems. A large number of focusing
problems encounter the natural ﬁeld symmetries about
the focal point and, therefore, they are opened to be ex-
pressed in terms of the Debye representation.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the transfer-
matrix formalism within the Debye approximation, and
accordingly to present a simpliﬁed form of the Collins
diﬀraction integral. In particular, we develop the diﬀrac-
tion matrix formulation for broadband complex optical

ray matrix theory is introduced.
In this way, we ob-
tain the longitudinal and angular dispersion inherent to
broadband focal waves. Additional constraints among
the matrix elements are achieved in a telecentric opti-
cal arrangement where the Debye representation exactly
evaluates the focal ﬁeld. In Sec. IV we extend the De-
bye representation for the evaluation of the focal ﬁeld in
diﬀraction-limited complex optical systems. The region
of validity of the Debye approximation is derived and the
role of the Fresnel number to enclose the focal volume is
pointed out. In Sec. V we analyze some examples. Re-
fractive and diﬀractive apertured singlets are studied in
detail. The dispersive behavior of the numerical aper-
ture and the Fresnel number is shown. We also discuss
the dispersion behavior of a version adapted for focusing
purposes of the optical system of Ref. [18] with nearly
frequency-independent Fraunhofer patterns. Finally, in
Sec. VI the main conclusions are outlined.

II. DEBYE REPRESENTATION OF FOCAL
WAVES

Consider a uniform plane wave incident normally onto
a focusing optical system. In front of the optical system
we place an aperture, of amplitude transmittance T (r0),
at a transverse plane hereafter called input plane, which
governs the amplitude and the extent of the emerging
beam. Consider a ray of the incident beam travelling
parallel to the optical axis and passing though the aper-
ture at a point of the input plane r0 = (r0, φ0) (in polar
coordinates).
If the focusing system is aberration-free,
the emerging ray is driven to the back focal point F lo-
cated at a distance f from the second principal point H
(see Fig. 1). A reference spherical surface, W , of centre in
the focal point F and radius f reproduces the wavefront
of the emerging focusing wave. When the sine condition
is satisﬁed, the trajectories of the incident and emerging
rays intersect on the reference surface.

In general, we may describe the direction of prop-
agation of the emerging geometrical ray by means
of the unitary three-dimensional (3-D) vector m =
(sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ) written in the Cartesian co-

2

(1)

(2)

The sine condition imposes a constraint for the zenith
giving

ϕ = φ0 + π .

sin θ =

r0
f

,

where g(θ) = sin θ is called the ray projection function
[31]. In general, g(θ) gives how a ray entering the optical
system is projected on the wavefront W , and may have
diﬀerent mathematical expressions other than the sine
function. For example, under the Herschel condition the
ray projection function is g(θ) = 2 sin(θ/2). However, in
the paraxial approximation (θ ≪ 1) the ray projection
function is unique, g(θ) = θ.

The focal ﬁeld may be evaluated in terms of the De-
bye formulation, which considers the interference of plane
waves with propagation directions given by the vector m.
The amplitude of the ﬁeld at a point P of the focal region
is then written as [19]

where Q(θ, ϕ)
(r cos φ, r sin φ, z), and k = ω/c is the wavenumber.
The numerical aperture of the focusing arrangement,
N A = sin α, is obtained from the equation g(α) = R/f ,
where R is the maximum lateral extent of the aperture.
Whereas |T |2 provides the ray density in the transverse
input plane, the squared modulus of the apodization
function |Q|2 gives the ray density over the spherical ref-
erence surface W . From the consideration of energy bal-
ance [31] we ﬁnd a relation of the apodization function
and the transmittance of the diﬀracting aperture

Then in the focal volume we have a superposition of plane
waves of amplitude distribution Q and propagating in
directions given by m.

When the incident plane wave is polychromatic, we
may use Eq. (3) to evaluate the amplitude distribution
in the focal region for the frequencies constituting the
ﬁeld spectral range. In general, an optical system is un-
able to focus the ﬁeld of diﬀerent frequencies in the same
focal point, being distributed along the optical axis (lon-
gitudinal chromatic aberration). Compensation of this
spatial dispersion is available, though the focus position
is not rigorously independent upon frequency.

Let us write the Debye diﬀraction integral for a fre-

quency ω as follows

In the previous equation we have dropped a factor

(6)

Also, we have used Eq. (1) in order to integrate in the
angular variable φ0. If F0 represents the focal point cor-
responding to a given reference frequency ω0, the param-
eter z0(ω) stands for the axial distance from F0 to the
geometrical focus for the frequency under consideration.
Moreover, the position of the second principal point H
is also spatially dispersed, thus aﬀecting to the value of
the focal length. Even in a case where the focal point is
strictly independent of the frequency, a dispersive focal
length f (ω) caused by an axial shift of H would alter
the angular distribution θ(ω) of plane waves in the fo-
cal region, as deduced from Eq. (2). This phenomenon
is denominated as angular dispersion, and is responsi-
ble of the dispersive character of the numerical aperture.
Although spatial and angular dispersion are commonly
neglected in achromatic objectives, we may design some
optical arrangements with distinctive dispersive behav-
ior. Finally, the ray projection function g(θ) may also
vary with the wavelength, though it will be neglected in
the present paper.

Previously to the use of the Debye diﬀraction formula
of Eq. (5) for broadband beams, the (spatial and angu-
lar) dispersion attributes of the focusing system should
be given, represented in the parameters z0(ω) and f (ω),
together with the ray projection function. According to
the paraxial approximation, if the numerical aperture of
the focused wave is suﬃciently small, tan θ and sin θ may
be replaced by θ, and the ray projection function is re-
duced to g(θ) = θ. Performing an additional geometri-
cal transformation θ = r0/f in the diﬀraction integral,
based on the paraxial approximation of Eq. (2), the De-
bye diﬀraction integral may be rewritten as

The dispersive behaviour of an aberration-free (z0 in-
dependent of r0 for a given frequency) optical system,
which is characterized by the focal length f (ω) and the
longitudinal dispersion z0(ω), is analyzed hereafter for
focused beams satisfying the paraxial condition (θ ≪ 1).
Under the paraxial regime, beam propagation in the op-
tical system may be represented with the ABCD matrix
method. Thus we follow a procedure to obtain the val-
ues of f and z0 by means of the elements of the ABCD
matrix of the optical system. The transfer matrix de-
scribes both the incident and emerging beams in basis of
geometrical rays.

Consider a ray incident onto the optical systems that,
at the input plane, propagates at a height r0 with an
angle θ0 with respect to the z-axis. If the ray traverses
an optical system described with a transfer matrix

the emerging ray exits with a height r and an angle θ
given by

M0 =

(cid:21)

r

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

.

When the incident ray propagates parallel to the optical
axis, θ0 = 0, as we shall assume here on, the exiting ray
travels with an angle

θ = C0r0

(11)

in the output plane (and any other transverse plane of
the focal region). This expression should be interpreted
as the paraxial approximation of Eq. (2). Consequently,
the focal distance is exclusively given by one element of
the matrix,

f = −

1
C0

.

(12)

Negative values of r and θ should be interpreted as an
inversion of 180 degrees with respect to the optical axis,
accounted by an increment of π rad in the azimuth angle.
Since the focal distance is dispersive by nature, f (ω),
and thus the matrix element C0(ω), a ray emerges from
the optical system with an angle given by Eq. (11) that
varies for diﬀerent frequencies. If we consider a marginal
ray propagating with a height r0 = R, which denotes
the maximum radial extent of the diﬀracting aperture,
the emerging ray has a maximum angle α, that is simply
the (paraxial) numerical aperture of the focusing wave (in
free space). From Eq. (11) we may obtain the dependence
of the numerical aperture upon frequency,

α(ω)
α0

=

C0(ω)
C0(ω0)

,

(13)

where α0 = α(ω0).

4

(18)

(19)

From Eq. (10) we have that the incident ray propa-
gating parallel to the optical axis (θ0 = 0) emerges at
the output plane with a height r = A0r0. In the future
we consider the output plane corresponds to the back
focal plane for a reference frequency ω0, and therefore
r(ω0) = 0 and A0(ω0) = 0. Longitudinal chromatic aber-
ration makes that the position of the focal point varies
with frequency, what implies that r(ω), and more impor-
tantly A0(ω), may diﬀer from zero for a frequency other
than ω0. Therefore, we should consider the propagation
from the output plane along a distance z0 in order to meet
the focus. To ﬁnd the value of z0 we consider the matrix
M0 and a free-space propagation matrix accounted in the
complete transfer matrix M as

(cid:21)

In the back focal plane for a given frequency ω, the value
of the element A(ω) vanishes. The solution of the linear
equation A = 0 is

In our case, R0 denotes the radius of the exit pupil plane,
which is conjugate of the input plane. Also, F0 represents
the distance from the back focal plane to the exit pupil
plane,

F0 = −

B0
D0

.

Finally, the Fresnel number of the focusing geometry is
written as

N =

(R/D0)2
λ|F0|

=

R2
λ|B0D0|

,

where λ = 2πc/ω is the wavelength.
In the previous
equation we have used that the magniﬁcation correspond-
−1
ing to the input (pupil) plane is D
0 . In telecentric opti-
cal systems, the value of F0 is inﬁnity and, since D0 = 0,
the Fresnel number also tends to inﬁnity.
In the next
section we will show that the Debye representation ac-
curately reproduces the focused ﬁeld when the Fresnel
number reaches values much higher than unity, N ≫ 1.
Finally, let us analyze the situation where the longitu-
dinal dispersion, given in terms of the axial parameter z0,
is suﬃciently small. By using Eq. (16) we may rewrite

(14)

(15)

z0 = −

A0
C0

.

Thus, the longitudinal dispersion is determined from the
elements A0 and C0 of the transfer matrix. In conclusion,
from Eqs. (12) and (15) we infer that the spatial (and
angular) dispersion of the focused beam is exclusively
characterized by two elements of the 2 × 2-matrix M0,
A0 and C0.

In a general problem explored with the ray matrix
method, we evaluate the four elements of the matrix M0.
However, the determinant gives unity,

A0D0 − B0C0 = 1 ,

(16)

thus reducing the degrees of freedom. Previously we have
deduced that we only two elements of the matrix M0,
concretely A0 and C0, are necessary to account for the
dispersive properties of the focused wave. Consequently,
the Debye representation derived in the previous section
should impose a further constraint. In this sense, note
that the scalar diﬀraction integrals of Eqs. (3) and (7)
give an exact solution of the focused waveﬁeld for tele-
centric lens systems [32].
In this case, the aperturing
screen is placed in the front focal plane, what represents
the input plane. Since −D0/C0 evaluates the distance
from the input plane to the front focal plane, a telecen-
tric optical system satisﬁes

D0 = 0 .

(17)

Therefore, such a requirement additionally assures the
exact validity of the Debye representation. Unfortu-
nately, wave dispersion frustrates that D0 vanishes for
a spectral range and, at least, we may impose D0 to be
suﬃciently small, for example, to vanish for the reference
frequency ω0.

Alternatively, the Debye approach is commonly exam-
0/λ|F0| [21].

ined in terms of the Fresnel number, N = R2

z0 =

A0B0
1 − A0D0

≈ A0B0 .

(20)

We have assumed that A0(ω0) = 0 and D0 is small in the
neighbourhood of ω0. Under these circumstances, z0 may
be expanded into a power series of the term A0D0. In
the lowest order we ﬁnd the approximation z0 = A0B0,
which is valid when

|A0D0| ≪ 1 ,

(21)

that is, for a given frequency ω suﬃciently close to the
reference frequency ω0. Eq. (20) may be compared with
Eq. (15), what gives the relation

C0 = −

1
B0

,

(22)

which is consistent with the approximation |A0D0| ≪ 1
together with the constraint of unitary determinant of
M0 given in Eq. (16).

IV. DEBYE APPROXIMATION OF THE
COLLINS DIFFRACTION INTEGRAL

A. Matrix-based formalism and region of validity
of the Debye representation

In terms of ABCD matrices, the waveﬁeld emerging
from a diﬀraction-limited optical system may be deter-
mined from the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral in
the form of the Collins formula [29],

In Eq. (23), Uω(r0) is the amplitude distribution in the
input plane, where the aperture is placed, which accounts
for the (occasionally dispersive) complex transmittance
of the diﬀracting element and the spectral strength of the
source. Also, we have omitted a term exp [iω(L + z)/c],
where L is the axial distance from the input plane to the
output plane, the latter being the back focal plane for a
reference frequency ω0 (usually the carrier frequency of
pulsed beams or the mean frequency of the power spec-
trum for incoherent white light). Moreover, the spatial
coordinate z represents an axial distance from the output
plane, and r⊥ = (r cos φ, r sin φ) indicates the transverse
spatial coordinates. Finally, the matrix M0 is evaluated
from the input plane to the output plane, which elements
are, in general, dispersive and therefore depending on
frequency. The particular selection of the output plane
guaranties that A0(ω0) = 0.

Eqs. (7) and (23) allow us to evaluate the 3-D ampli-
tude distribution in the focal region. However, compari-
son of the paraxial diﬀraction integral within the Debye
approximation and the Collins formula manifests some
diﬀerences. First we address our attention to the de-
pendence upon the axial spatial coordinate of the phase
terms in the diﬀraction integral. In the Debye representa-
tion, the argument of the phase terms varies linearly with
z, in opposition to the more complicated dependence in
the Collins integral. An approach may be performed af-
ter a ﬁrst-order series expansion of the argument about
the point z = 0. Concretely, we may write

(25)

where A0D0 − B0C0 = 1 of Eq. (16) has been used. The
physical interpretation of this approximation lies on the
assumption that the focal ﬁeld is mostly concentrated in
the vicinity of focus, satisfying

|z| ≪

B0
D0

,

(26)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
and then we may write B = B0 + zD0 ≈ B0. More-
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
over, in terms of the axial parameter F0 = −B0/D0
given in Eq. (18), which represents the distance from the
back focal plane to the image of the input plane (exit
pupil plane), the previous inequality may be simpliﬁed
as |z| ≪ |F0|. Consequently, Eq. (26) involves that the
focal volume is far from the exit pupil plane.

We identify a second diﬀerence in the presence of a
quadratic (on r) phase factor in Eq. (23), external to the
diﬀraction integral, which is not found in Eq. (7). How-
ever, this term may be neglected under the assumption
that the evaluation of the focal ﬁeld is performed in a
region where (ω/2c)|D/B|r2 ≪ π, that is,

5

The left side of this inequality has the form of a Fres-
nel number, and next it will be analyzed in detail.
In
resume, a full analogy of the diﬀraction integrals given
from the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ formulation and the Debye
representation is found if the analysis of the focal ﬁeld is
accomplished in the restricted region given by Eqs. (26)
and (27).

Let us write the Debye diﬀraction integral

In comparison with Eq. (7) we ﬁnd that the focal dis-
tance is written as f = B0. From geometrical consid-
erations we have obtained the same result written in
Eq. (12), combined with the approximated equation (22).
From the comparison we also have that z0/f 2 = A0/B0,
that is, z0 = A0B0. Again, this result has been previ-
ously obtained in Eq. (20) under the assumption that
|A0D0| ≪ 1. Alternatively, this inequality may be writ-
ten as

|z0/F0| ≪ 1 ,

(29)

which is simply the condition given in Eq. (26) for the
speciﬁc value of the axial coordinate z = z0. In conse-
quence, the focus position observed for a given frequency,
F (ω), is to be far from the exit pupil plane, that is, in
the near-ﬁeld region of the focused wave. In the case of
highly-dispersive focusing elements, this condition may
bring serious restrictions on the spectral bandwidth of
the incident beam in order to assure the validity of the
Debye representation.

We point out that when D0 = 0, the Collins formula
given in Eq. (23) reduces to the matrix-based diﬀrac-
tion integral in the Debye representation of Eq. (28). In
this case F0 tends to inﬁnity, that is, the exit pupil is
located inﬁnitely far away from the focal region. As a
consequence, the validity of the Debye formulation is ex-
panded into the whole space. In this singular case one
cannot speak of “Debye approximation”.

Importantly, we may conclude that the Debye approxi-
mation imposes bounds on the spatial coordinates where
the focal waveﬁeld is evaluated, as seen in Eqs. (26) and
(27), giving an accurate estimation under a limited lon-
gitudinal dispersion shown in Eq. (29).

B. Spatial symmetries

λ|F0|

≪ 1 .

A relevant issue associated with apertured spherical
waves correctly described in the Debye representation
is the inherent symmetry about the focal point. From
Eq. (28) we ﬁnd that if the wave function in the input

(27)

plane is real, Uω(r0) ∈ ℜ, then the focal ﬁeld is symmet-

where ∗ denotes a complex conjugate. Note that we
have considered the focal point is found at a distance
z0 = A0B0. A real wave function is encountered, for
example, when a pulsed unchirped Gaussian beam prop-
agates through a diﬀraction-limited optical system with a
clear circular aperture. In particular, Wolf et al. [21, 22]
considered the spatial symmetries of the intensity in the
focal region of polychromatic spherical waves. They con-
cluded that when the diﬀracting screen is purely absorb-
ing, the focal intensity is centro-symmetric about the fo-
cus, where the maximum intensity is observed.

For the sake of simplicity, we follow our discussion un-
der the hypothesis that the waveﬁeld in the input plane
may be factorized in the form Uω(r0) = S0(ω)T (r0). The
ﬁrst function represents the spectral strength of the in-
cident radiation, which depends exclusively on the fre-
quency. The second is an azimuthally-symmetric func-
tion of the radial spatial coordinate, which accounts for
the aperture transmittance.
In this diﬀraction prob-
lem we assume that the amplitude transmittance of the
diﬀracting aperture is frequency independent, what holds
for purely-absorbing screens. The Collins diﬀraction for-
mula in the Debye approximation is ﬁnally written as

C. The role of the Fresnel number

Previously we have demonstrated that the diﬀraction
integral in the Debye representation may be systemat-
ically employed with a unique spatial limitation (apart
from the longitudinal dispersion), conceiving a region of
validity shown in Eqs. (26) and (27). In principle, we lack
the guaranty that the region of interest, that is, the focal
volume, belongs to the region of validity of the Debye
representation. Here we analyze the conditions an spher-
ical waveﬁeld, that emerges from an apertured optical
system of transfer matrix M0, should satisfy in order to
enclose the focal volume in the required bounded region.
For simplicity, let us analyze the case of a diﬀraction-
limited optical arrangement with a circular clear aperture
of radius R, i.e., T (r0) = 1 [33]. Also, in this examina-
tion we neglect the longitudinal dispersion, and then we
restrict our analysis to the case where A0 = 0 for a given
frequency. The ﬁeld distribution along the optical axis is
calculated by means of Eq. (31), which particularized to

and −z1. The highest values of the on-axis intensity are
found at points comprised between these two zeros, and
thus we may consider the region of interest is |z| ≤ z1.
Validity of the Debye representation in this region implies
that the inequality of Eq. (26) is satisﬁed for |z| ≤ z1,
what means that z1 ≪ |B0/D0|. Equivalently we may
write

2 ≪

R2
λ|B0D0|

,

that is, 2 ≪ N , where N is the Fresnel number given
in Eq. (19).
In accordance we conclude that a Fresnel
number much higher than unity guaranties that the focal
ﬁeld is accurately described with the Debye representa-
tion along the optical axis and neighbouring points.

On regards the oﬀ-axis points of the focal volume, let
us investigate the waveﬁeld in the transverse focal plane,
z = 0. From Eq. (31) we ﬁnally have

Uω(r) =

(cid:19)

where J1 is a Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and order 1.
The ﬁeld distribution given in Eq. (35) is simply the so-
called Airy disk. Again, the maximum of intensity occurs
at the origin, and the ﬁrst zero of intensity is found at

r1 = 1.22π

.

Note also that r1 gives the limit of resolution of a
diﬀraction-limited imaging system in agreement with the
Rayleigh criterion. Again, the Debye representation is
valid if Eq. (27) is fully satisﬁed for points r ≤ r1. Thus,
we should impose that r2
1 ≪ λ|B0/D0|, what may be
written as 0.37 ≪ N . As a result, high values of the
Fresnel number allow the focal ﬁeld to be conﬁned in the
region of validity of the Debye representation, satisfying
simultaneously the inequalities of Eqs. (26) and (27).

A diﬀracting screen is placed in front of the lens at a

consider an aperture located at the back of the lens. As
previously established, the input plane is set in the place
of the diﬀracting aperture, whereas the output plane cor-
responds to the back focal plane for ω0. In this case, the

lenses. Diﬀractive singlets are zone plates which may
achieve a high-eﬃciency performance with phase-only
multilevels [35]. Recently, some authors have addressed
special attention to investigate the spatio-temporal re-
sponse of broadband ultra-short pulses focused with zone
plates [23, 36, 37]. Here we are giving a simpliﬁed formal-
ism to evaluate the focal ﬁeld in the frame of the Debye
representation. The focal length of a Fresnel lens may be
modelized as [38]

f0
f (ω)

=

ω0
ω

.

(38)

and, obviously, C0(ω) = −f −1(ω). Supposing that the
focal distance is independent upon frequency, what oc-
curs for achromatic objectives, the term A0 takes val-
ues identically zero. However, A0 may reach signiﬁcant
values when the focusing lens is highly dispersive, thus
producing a notable longitudinal dispersion. Also, when
the diﬀracting aperture is at the front focal plane for a
given frequency ω, being d = f (ω), the focusing system
is telecentric and, correspondingly, D0 = 0.

Two sort of thin lenses are analyzed in this sec-
tion: kinoform-type diﬀractive lenses and refractive thin

Secondly, quartz and glass thin lenses are considered.
Plano convex lenses are the most basic optical elements.
They have positive focal lengths and close to the op-
timum shape for use as focusing lenses for collimated
beams. If n(ω) denotes the refractive index of the trans-
parent material the lens is made of, the focal length of
the refractive singlet may be expressed as

f0
f (ω)

=

n(ω) − 1
n0 − 1

,

(39)

being n0 = n(ω0). Bi-convex and other spherical lenses

may be treated similarly. Instead of using tabulated data
of the refractive index n(ω) of a given medium, we may
employ the Sellmeier equation, which is an empirical re-
lationship between refractive index n and wavelength λ.
The usual form of the equation for glasses is:

n2(λ) = 1 +

B1λ2
λ2 − C1

+

B2λ2
λ2 − C2

+

B3λ2
λ2 − C3

,

(40)

where Bi and Ci, for i = 1, 2, 3, are experimentally deter-
mined Sellmeier coeﬃcients. Note that this λ = 2πc/ω
is the vacuum wavelength. As an example, here we con-
sider a common borosilicate crown glass known as BK7,
and the Sellmeier coeﬃcients are shown in Table I.

In Fig. 3 we investigate the longitudinal chromatic
aberration in relation to proximity to the exit pupil plane.
This point is important since the Debye approximation
is restricted to a limited axial dispersion expressed as
|A0D0| ≪ 1, as given in Eq. (29).
In the ﬁgure we
use the reference frequency ω0 associated to the aver-
age wavelength λ0 = 589.3 nm of the Sodium doublet.
In general, the highly-dispersive character of the Fresnel
lens severely restricts the spectral range we may use the
Debye representation of the focal ﬁeld. A relevant prop-
erty is that when d = f0, i.e. the system is telecentric for
the radiation frequency ω0, the term A0D0 is stationary.
In other words, A0D0 = 0 for the reference frequency ω0
(since A0(ω0) = 0) and

∂(A0D0)
∂ω

= 0 ,

(41)

for ω0. Consequently, the values of A0D0 remain signif-
icantly low in the spectral neighbourhood around ω0, as
seen in Fig. 3(a). However, when the aperture is at the
lens plane (d = 0), ω0 is not a stationary point of A0D0,
whose values may increase up to one order of magnitude,
as shown in Fig. 3(b). The analysis of a BK7 glass thin
lens has also been included in the ﬁgure. Comparatively,
the refractive lens gives values of |A0D0| considerably
lower than those provided by a Fresnel lens. In this case,
application of the Debye approximation is less stringent
in terms of bandwidth, even considering the case of aper-
tures located at the lens plane.

Validity of the Debye approximation is also restricted
to Fresnel numbers much higher than 1, what is under
study in the following example. Consider a circular clear
aperture of diameter 2R = 1 cm and a thin lens of focal
length f0 = 10 cm for the reference wavelength λ0 =
589.3 nm. If the diﬀracting aperture is placed at the lens
plane, the Fresnel number for the reference frequency

N0 =

.

(42)

In the present numerical example N0 = 424. For other
frequencies and positions of the aperture, the Fresnel
number N (ω) varies according to Eq. (19). Let us exam-
ine a reduced Fresnel number, normalized to the Fresnel

When the aperture is placed at the lens plane, d = 0, the
terms B0 = f0 and D0 = 1 are spectrally invariant (non-
dispersive), and the reduced Fresnel number is ﬁnally ex-
pressed as N/N0 = ω/ω0. This result is valid for any thin
(Fresnel and dispersive glass) lens, as seen in Fig. 4(b).
In the case the focusing system is telecentric (for ω0),
where d = f0, the value of D0(ω0) vanishes and, con-
sequently, the Fresnel number diverges for the reference
frequency. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the Fresnel number for
neighboring frequencies reaches extremely high values.
Comparatively, the Fresnel number associated with the
Fresnel lens are several orders of magnitude higher that
those of a BK7 glass lens. In general, we may conclude
that the requirement N ≫ 1 is fully satisﬁed within the
visible spectral band.

The angular dispersion of the focal waves produced by
a thin lens may be examined with the matrix element
C0(ω) and Eq. (13). For instance, a diﬀractive lens has

In Fig. 5 we plot the relative numerical aperture for a
diﬀractive lens (subﬁgure a) and a BK7 glass lens (sub-
ﬁgure b). The exact expression given in Eq. (13) shows
that the relative numerical aperture, and thus the an-
gular dispersion, is independent of the variable d, i.e.,
the aperture place. However, Eq. (45) reveals a small
dependence on d, mainly in the case of the zone plate.
This point is important since we deduce from Eq. (45)
that, in the case d = 0, the numerical aperture is nondis-
persive, i.e., α(ω) = α0. Strictly speaking, this result
is false though the angular dispersion is relatively small
and may be ignored. On the contrary, the approximation
given in Eq. (45) is extremely accurate when d = f0. We

may conclude that deviations of Eqs. (13) and (45) in-
trinsically elucidate the degree of accuracy of the Debye
approximation.

In Fig. 6 we show some contour plots of the three-
dimensional intensity distribution of an apertured Fres-
nel thin lens and a BK7 glass lens of focal distance
f0 = 10 cm for a wavelength λ0 = 589.3 nm. The
ﬁeld intensity is numerically evaluated from Eq. (31) for
T (r0) = 1 and diﬀerent frequencies. Also, we have se-
lected a value of S0 such that the intensity at the focus
is unity, and the gray levels are plotted in a logarithmic
scale of intensities to increase the contrast. Again, the
diﬀracting screen is a clear circular aperture of diame-
ter 2R = 1 cm and placed at a distance d = f0. The

observe that the glass lens presents a higher resistance
to dispersion-induced focal shifts. Additionally, for in-
creasing frequencies, the focal shift is driven toward the
lens for the refracting singlet, in opposition to the case of
the Fresnel lens. Finally, an additional spatial dispersion
eﬀect is distinct in the subﬁgures of the glass lens. In or-
der to have comparable longitudinal dispersion with the
Fresnel lens, the selected frequencies considerably diﬀer,
with 20 per cent of increment (∆ω/ω0 = 0.2). In this
case, the size of the focal spot is notably higher for lower
frequencies, what is clearly observed by computing the
number of minima (black shades) along the optical axis
and in the transverse focal plane.

B. White-light focusing system with compensated
spatial dispersion

A number of designs of achromatic doublet lenses
[39] and hybrid refractive-diﬀractive achromats [40] have
been proposed to get rid of longitudinal chromatic aber-
ration inherent in singlet lenses. Ray matrices of this sort
of focusing setups have (at least approximately) a vanish-
ing term A0(ω) = 0, a performance that can be achieved
over a broad spectral band. Commonly, this property is
accompanied with spectral invariance of the focal length,
meaning that both B0 and C0 are also invariant in the
considered spectral range. When used on-axis, an achro-
matic lens focuses a parallel input beam to a single point.
However, the oﬀ-axis performance is signiﬁcantly worse
than the on-axis performance since it is limited by the
eﬀects of diﬀraction. For instance, the limit of resolution
r1 given in Eq. (36) and frequency are inversely propor-
tional.

In Ref.

[18] Lancis et al. proposed an optical sys-
tem composed of a nondispersive objective coupled with
a pair of kinoform-type diﬀractive lenses to overcome
longitudinal chromatic aberration and, additionally, the
diﬀraction-induced spatial dispersion of the Fraunhofer
pattern observed in the transverse focal plane. A ﬁrst
diﬀractive lens (DL1) of focal length Z1 (for ω0) is placed
in front of the achromat (of focal length f0 for all fre-

diﬀracting screen is a clear aperture, the spectral com-

The angular dispersion of this singular optical arrange-

arbitrarily changed. However, the Fresnel number may

counts for the condition of telecentricity for ω0, for which
the Fresnel number diverges. This favours that the spa-
tial constraints of the focal volume, associated with the
Debye approximation, are fulﬁlled.

Finally, Fig. 10 depicts the isophotes in the neighbour-
hood of the focal point for diﬀerent frequencies. In all
cases, the Airy disk formed in the focal plane has a com-
parable magnitude. However, an increase in frequency
induces a broadening of the focal spot along the optical
axis. We point out that this behavior substantially diﬀers
from a conventional achromat lens, where transverse and
axial widths of the central lobe have a linear dependence
with the inverse of the frequency.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived an ABCD matrix-based generaliza-
tion of the Debye representation of focal ﬁelds. This
diﬀraction integral has been achieved using two alterna-
tive procedures. In the ﬁrst approach we substitute the
focal length and the longitudinal dispersion, which are
explicit parameters in the classical Debye integral, by
equivalent expressions given in terms of the ray-matrix
elements. The second method consists in applying sim-
ple approximations into the Collins diﬀraction formula.
The latter one has the advantage of providing some an-
alytical constraints which determine the validity of the
proposed integral.
In this sense, the evaluation of the
focal ﬁeld is restricted to a bounded region around the
focus (for a given frequency). As in the standard anal-
ysis, the inclusion of the focal region into the region of
validity of the Debye approximation is guaranteed when
the Fresnel number of the focusing geometry greatly ex-
ceeds unity. Under the above assumptions, diﬀraction

FIG. 10: Contour plot of the ﬁeld strength in the focal region of the optical system in Fig. 7. The contour intervals vary 0.75
in a log scale to augment the contrast. The achromatic objective has a focal length f = 10 cm, and the aperture is placed at a
distance d = 10 cm. Each plot corresponds to the frequency (a) (1 − ∆)ω0, (b) ω0, and (c) (1 + ∆)ω0, with ∆ = 0.2.

of purely-absorbing screens generates focal ﬁelds whose
spectral components show symmetrical amplitude distri-
butions around the focus.

In a second stage, the matrix-based Debye integral has
been applied to investigate the spectral response of an
apertured thin lens, either diﬀracting or refractive. The
position of the pupil aperture has a strong relevance in
the Fresnel number, being the telecentric geometry the
most appropriate design for the Debye representation.
Due to the longitudinal chromatic aberration, an angular
dispersion eﬀect is observable and may be important in
the case of Fresnel lenses.

Going one step further, we have also examined the op-
tical setup proposed by Lancis et al. [18] in the frame of

the Debye representation. This system shows a highly-
dispersive numerical aperture, approaching the angu-
lar dispersion of an apertured Fresnel lens, but being
free of longitudinal chromatic aberration. The numeri-
cal aperture of the focusing system decreases with fre-
quency, approximately following an inverse dependence.
The dispersive nature of diﬀraction is then compensated
in the transverse focal plane, showing nearly frequency-
independent Fraunhofer patterns. As a collateral eﬀect,
a positive magniﬁcation of the focused ﬁeld along the
optical axis may be recognized.

In short, the present formalism leaves door open to
the analysis and design of focused beams with variable
angular dispersion.

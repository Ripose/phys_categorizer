Abstract

The Doppler eﬀect for the reﬂected and refracted waves at an idealized moving interface separat-

ing two stationary left-handed materials are systemically analyzed in this letter. The theoretical

formulae for Doppler shifts for the left-handed materials, which are described by Drude’s disper-

sion model, are presented. Those formulae are examined by ﬁrst-principles numerical experiments

using the ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain method. Inverse Doppler eﬀects for reﬂected waves from

the moving interfaces are conﬁrmed in left-handed materials.

The Doppler eﬀect is a well-known phenomenon that the frequency of a wave emitting

from a moving object is shifted from the source frequency, originally discovered by Christian

Doppler in 1843 [1, 2]. Conventional Doppler shift tells us that the measured frequency

will increase when a source and observe approach each other. In virtue of this eﬀect, an

immense variety of novel applications are widely established including weather and aircraft

radar system, blood ﬂow measurement, and discovery of new planets and binary stars. The

inverse Doppler eﬀect refers to frequency shifts that are in the opposite sense to those

mentioned above. It has been observed in a dielectric-loaded stripline cyclotron-resonance

maser oscillator [3], the moving shock wave propagating through a photonic crystals [4]

and the moving boundary in an electrical transmission line [5]. In fact, back to 1968, the

inverse Doppler eﬀect has been already predicted to occur in a left-handed material (LHM)

with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability [6]. Pendry et al. discovered a

microwave-plasma thin-wire structure exhibiting negative permittivity below the electronic

plasma frequency [7] and a magnet-free split-ring resonator structure exhibiting negative

permeability below the magnetic plasma frequency [8]. With the suggestion of Pendry’s

theory, the ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcation of a LHM was demonstrated [9], which has recently

received much attention in the literature [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. However, up to our knowledge,

inverse Doppler eﬀect in a left-handed material has not been demonstrated experimentally

yet, not even by numerical experiments.

In this letter, we will study Doppler eﬀects from a moving interface between two homo-

geneous stationary materials (which includes left-handed materials), and present theoretical

formulae for the Doppler shifts, which will be examined by ﬁrst-principles numerical exper-

iments using the ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain (FDTD) method.

Consider a plane electromagnetic wave propagation in medium I and incident at an angle

θ1 on an idealized moving interface S (with a velocity v in

z directions) separating two

−

regions with diﬀerent macroscopic parameter. Medium on both sides of the interface is

assumed to be at rest. The incident wave have an angular frequency ω1 and a propagation

vector k1. For a special case for a LHM, the set-up is sketched in Fig. 1. In the LHM,

the direction of group velocity, same as that of energy ﬂux, is often antiparallel to phase

velocity. To calculate Doppler shifts eﬀectively for the reﬂected and refracted wave in such a

inertial system, a primed coordinate frame embedded in the moving interface is introduced.

The primed frame moves with the same velocity v as the interface relative to the unprimed

(original) coordinate system. Here we keep the axes of the primed coordinate system parallel

to corresponding axis of the unprimed system. Therefore, we can treat the space components

of both the primed and unprimed system as vectors in a common three-dimensional space.

One is interested in determining the characteristics of the reﬂected and refracted waves

knowing the frequency of the incident wave.

If the primed frame is moving with a velocity v with respect to the unprimed, one can
relate r′ and t′ with r and t through a pure Lorentz transformation (no rotation of the space

axes) expressed in three-dimensional notation (see Podolsky and Kunz [15]),

where

Consider a 4-vector expressed in the Minkowski notation by (k, iω/c). Based on the theorem

which is the Doppler shift in going to the primed frame.

To obtain a solution to the problem posed above it is convenient to ﬁrstly consider in the

primed frame, in which the interface is at rest and the media are moving with a velocity

v. In the primed frame there is no Doppler shifts at the interface, we can set

as the required generalization, where ω′

1, ω′

2, ω′

3 is the frequency of incident, reﬂected and

refracted wave in the primed frame, respectively. Using the inverse of Eq. (3), one can

replace Eq. (4) and then obtain

where

as

Finally, we obtain the reﬂected and refracted frequencies in respects of the incident frequency

where θ1, θ2, θ3 denotes the incident, reﬂected and refracted angle, and where n1, n′

1, n2 is

the refractive index for the incident, reﬂected and refracted wave, respectively. In the case

of moving interface, the law of reﬂection and Snell’s law of refraction is no longer suitable at

the interface. Moreover, since the LHM is often a dispersive material, the refractive index
n′
1 for the reﬂected wave in the medium I is not the same as n1 due to the Doppler shift for

the reﬂected wave. Same eﬀect will occur on n2 for the refracted wave.

As a LHM is always a dispersive media, the following Drude’s lossless dispersive model

[16] for the relative permittivity and permeability of the LHM is used

FIG. 2: Doppler shifts at the moving interface between two diﬀerent conventional materials for

the (a) reﬂected wave; (b) refracted wave. The left is in air, and the right is another conventional

medium with n2 = 3. The open circle markers represent the values predicted by the Doppler

formulae, and the asterisk markers represent the numerically simulated values obtained by the

FDTD method.

Next, we will give some numerical examples to examine these Doppler formulae by ﬁrst-

principles numerical experiments using the ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain method [17]. For

simplicity, we consider the E-polarized electromagnetic wave incident normally on the in-

terface, which is moving toward the source. It is similar for the case of the interface moving

away from the source. We perform ﬁrstly a FDTD simulation to study the case for the mov-

ing interface between two conventional materials. The left is in air and the refractive index

5

of the right medium is n2 = 3. A line source of continuous wave along x direction is placed

at the left side of the interface, and two detectors are placed on each side. Since we only

consider the electromagnetic wave incident normally on the interface, it is naturally chosen

the periodic condition in the x direction and the perfect matched layers (PMLs) [18] in the

z direction as numerical boundary treatments. Due to stability of the FDTD algorithm
1/(cq1/∆x2 + 1/∆z2)), the interface always moves less than ∆z for each time step,
i.e., the moving interface often do not lie at the grid point. In all our simulations, a tech-

(∆t

≤

nique of parameter approximation based on the ﬁrst order Lagrange approximation at the

moving interface is used. The theoretical Doppler formulae for the conventional materials

are the same as those for the case of LHMs, except frequency-independent refractive indices

for conventional materials in Eqs. (7,8). Figure 2 shows the Doppler shifts at an idealized

moving interface for the (a) reﬂected wave; (b) refracted wave. In Fig. 2, the open circle

markers represent the values predicted by the Doppler formulae, and the asterisk markers

represent the numerically simulated values obtained by FDTD method. It can be seen from

Fig. 2 that the results of our simulations are in good agreement with the theoretical results.

From Fig. 2 (a), one ﬁnds that the frequency of reﬂected wave becomes larger when the

interface moves to the source, which is referred as normal Doppler shift (blueshifted).

For the LHM described by Drude’s model, as a special case, we ﬁrstly consider the system

with moving interface between air and a LHM. The FDTD method for the Drude’s model

is discussed in detail in [19]. We choose ω1 = ωp2/√2, where ωp2 is the plasma frequency

or magnetic resonance frequency of medium II. At that time, the refractive index of the

medium II for the incident frequency (ω1) satisﬁes n2 =

1, matched with air. It has been

−

shown that light can go through such an stationary air-LHM interface without reﬂection for

any incident angle [20]. However, this is only correct for the case of a stationary interface

since the ﬁeld boundary condition at moving interface is quite diﬀerent with that at the

stationary case [15]. As the left medium is air, the Doppler shift for the reﬂected wave is

governed by Eq. (7) for the electromagnetic wave incident normally on the moving interface.

Figure 3 shows the Doppler shifts at an idealized moving interface between air and the LHM

for the (a) reﬂected wave; (b) refracted wave. The values predicted by the Doppler formulae

(Eqs. (11,12)) are presented by open circle markers, and simulation results obtained by the

FDTD method are shown by asterisk markers. From Fig. 3(a), one ﬁnds that simulation

results are in good agreement with the theoretical values, which are also consistent with

6

the results in Fig. 2 (a).

It can be understood from Eq. (7) that the Doppler shift for

the reﬂected wave only relates with velocity of interface and electromagnetic property of

the medium I, no any relation with the medium II. The results for the refracted wave

by theoretical formula in Fig. 3 (b) are also in good agreement with those by numerical

simulations. Compared with results in Fig. 2 (b), the refracted frequency is higher than the

incident frequency. However, this is not really an inverse Doppler shift since we can obtain

it for the case of conventional materials when n1 > n2.

(b) refracted wave. The refractive index of the medium II for the incident frequency is

1, matched

−

with the left medium (air). The open circle and asterisk markers have the same meaning as those

in FIG. 2.

As stated in the introduction, the reverse Doppler eﬀect arises due to the negative index

of refraction. The deﬁnition of Doppler shift tells us that when a source moves inside the

LHM at the initial stationary frame, the abnormal Doppler eﬀect will be observed. Here

we consider the system with moving interface between two diﬀerent left-handed materials.

We choose ω1 = ωp/√2, ωp1 = ωp, and ωp2 = √2ωp, which means that the refractive index

of left and right medium for the incident frequency is

1 and

3, respectively. Due to

−

−

Doppler shifts at the moving interface, the refractive index of the left and right medium

for the reﬂected and refracted wave will change, respectively. Figure 4 shows that the

refractive index of the medium I for the reﬂected frequency varies from

1.59 to

3.60,

LHMs are shown in Fig. 5, in which the circle and asterisk markers represent the theoretical

−

values (obtained by Eqs. (11,12)) and simulation results (obtained by the FDTD method),

respectively. Although the simulation results have a diﬀerence with theoretical values, the

numerical errors are always less than 1.5%. We can believe that the simulation results are

consistent with theoretical values both for the reﬂected and refracted wave. It is also shown

8

in Fig. 5 (a) that, compared with the results in Figs. 2 (a) and 3 (a), the Doppler shift for

the reﬂected wave is really an inverse Doppler eﬀect (redshifted), . It is also in agreement

with the prediction in the LHM.

In conclusion, we have studied systemically the Doppler eﬀects for the reﬂected and re-

fracted wave at an idealized moving interface separating two stationary LHMs and obtained

theoretical formulae for the Doppler shifts in LHMs, which are described by Drude’s dis-

persion model. We have performed ﬁrst-principles numerical experiments to examine the

Doppler shifts. It has been shown that the results obtained by our theoretical formulae are

in good agreement with those obtained by numerical experiments.

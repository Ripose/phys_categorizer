We report on the possibility of having two black solitons interacting inside a silica ﬁber that presents
normal group-velocity dispersion, to generate a pair of solitons, a vector soliton of the black-bright
type. The model obeys a pair of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations, that follows in accor-
dance with a Ginzburg-Landau equation describing the anisotropic XY model. We solve the coupled
equations using a trial-orbit method, which plays a signiﬁcant role when we reduce the Schr¨odinger
equations to ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations.

Solitary waves and solitons are relevant to a variety
of nonlinear physical processes. They have made per-
haps the geatest experimental impact in the ﬁeld of non-
linear ﬁber optics, which are widely known to support
solitons of several diﬀerent types [1–3]. For instance, in
silica ﬁbers there are optical solitons of the bright and
dark types. They appear because the Kerr nonlinear-
ity in silica is always described by a positive coeﬃcient,
so that the sign of the group-velocity dispersion distin-
guishes two diﬀerent types of solitons in silica ﬁbers: the
bright soliton, for negative sign of the group-velocity dis-
persion, and the dark soliton, for positive group-velocity
dispersion. These two types of optical solitons were ﬁrst
reported in Ref. [4], in the case of bright solitons, and in
Ref. [5], in the case of dark solitons. They are solutions
of the cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, and they
are characterized by having distinct proﬁle: the bright
soliton has vanishing asymptotic behavior, so they en-
gender trivial topological behavior. On the other hand,
dark solitons are characterized by non vanishing asymp-
totic behavior, so the presence of topological proﬁle is
one important feature of dark solitons. The central char-
acteristic of dark solitons is the presence of a dip in its
center, which distinguishes two possibilities: black soli-
tons, in the case the dip reaches the botton, that is, if
the dip goes completely to zero, and gray solitons, in the
other cases.

Although both bright and dark solitons are widely
known to be present in ﬁbers, they are not exclusive of
ﬁbers. They can also appear in other systems, in particu-
lar in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), and in magnetic
materials. The old prediction that an ideal gas of identi-
cal bosons may condensate into a macroscopic quantum
state has recently been accomplished: BECs of diﬀer-
ent atomic elements were ﬁrst produced in [6–8], and are
reviewed for instance in Ref. [9]. Soom after this achiev-
ment, the presence of bright solitons in a BEC was ﬁrst
reported in Ref. [10], in the study of the dynamics of ul-
tracold bosonic atoms loaded in an optical lattice, that
is, in a lattice induced by the interference of an array
of laser beams [11]. The presence of dark solitons was

reported more recently in Refs. [12,13]. The presence of
bright or dark solitons in BEC is directly related to the
physics of attractive or repulsive interatomic interaction,
respectivelly, in a mean-ﬁeld description that follows in
accordance with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [14]. In
magnetic ﬁlms one ﬁnds dark solitons [15–17] in the form
of a microwave magnetic envelope (MME). A good ex-
ample of this was recently reported in Ref. [18], where
one can ﬁnd an interesting way of generating dark MME
solitons, which opens a new route for the investigation of
dark solitons in magnetic systems.

In silica ﬁbers both black and bright solitons spring as
solutions of the cubic non-linear Schr¨odinger equation,
with just a change in the sign of the term that controls the
group-velocity dispersion in that equation. We illustrate
the two possibilities considering the normalized equation
that describes the electric ﬁeld envelope U = U (x, z)
inside the optical ﬁber

The variables x and z describe the reduced time and
space coordinates inside the ﬁber, respectively. This
equation takes into accound the temporal or group-
the second term in the above
velocity dispersion,
Schr¨odinger equation, and weak Kerr nonlinearity, the
third term in Eq. (1). The two signs represent the two
standard situations, that generate the black and bright
solitons.

The presence of

follows after writing

U±(x, t) = u±(x)exp(iz). We get

where ¯x is an arbitrary point, which refers to the cen-
ter of the soliton. Here u+(x) and u−(x) represent the

fundamental solitons, the bright and dark solitons, re-
spectively. In fact, u−(x) is a black soliton since the dip
in u2
−(x) goes to zero, reaching the botton of the electric
ﬁeld envelope.

We consider the possibility of describing a more gen-
eral situation. We think of using a single ﬁber, an
optical medium with normal group-velocity dispersion.
However, we illuminate the ﬁber with two distinct laser
beams, having diﬀerent amplitudes and opposite circu-
lar polarizations. The electric ﬁelds are characterized by
the envelopes U (x, z) and V (x, z), and the system is de-
scribed by the two normalized equations

These solutions represent black soliton solutions. The
system we are preparing is such that in the reduced case
of just one component, obtained after turning oﬀ one of
the two laser beams, the interactions between the optical
ﬁber and the beam give rise to a black soliton. Each one

of the black solitons has its own characteristics, which
are naturally related to each one of the two laser beams
since we are not changing the optical medium, the ﬁber.
The individual black solitons are diﬀerent, giving rise to
an asymmetrical arrangement that will allow interesting
novelties, not seen in the cases explored in Refs. [19–21].

The idea remindes us of other similar eﬀects:
tum optics, a superposition of two (antisqueezed) number
states may exhibit squeezing eﬀect [22], a property not
shown by any isolated component; also, a superposition
of two (most classical) coherent states may results in a
nonclassical (Schr¨odinger’s cat) state, as observed exper-
imentally for light ﬁelds [23] and for trapped ions [24].

The main characteristics of the two black solitons are
depicted in Fig. 1, where we plot both the ub(x) and
vb(x). We notice that the amplitude (a) and width (w)
of ub(x) are such that au = wu = 1, but for vb(x) they
become av = wv =
1/r. Thus, in the following we will

The limit r

1 describes the case of interactions be-
tween laser beams of same amplitude but opposite circu-
lar polarizations in an isotropic Kerr medium. This case
is simpler, and can be described by a system of sym-
metrically coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations. For
the pair of symmetrically coupled equations, if we set
F1(u, v) = G1(u, v) = u2 + v2 we get the well known
Manakov model [25]. This model can also be used to
represent the isotropic XY model [26], which obeys the
Ginzburg-Landau equation ∂A/∂t = ∂2A/∂x2 + A

2A, where A is complex. We use A = X + iY to show

that for static conﬁgurations the above Ginzburg-Landau
equation leads to the symmetrically coupled nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations. We use this as a guide toward
the more general asymmetric model, and we consider the
anisotropic XY model, which is described by

∂A

where α is real. We use this model to investigate the case
of two laser beams, in a medium such that Fr(u, v) =

u2 + r(2r + 1)v2 and Gr(u, v) = r2v2 + r(2r + 1)u2, that
obey Fr(u, 0) = u2 and Gr(0, v) = r2 v2, as required to
recuperate the case describing a single laser beam, when
the other beam is turned oﬀ. The form of the interaction
is dictated by the anisotropic XY model, and by the two
laser beams that enter the ﬁber.

The above considerations settle the problem. And now
the key issue follows after recognizing that the coupled
Schr¨odinger equations can be seen as equations of motion
for static ﬁelds that appear in models of two real scalar
ﬁelds in bidimensional space-time [27]. In the case under
examination the system of two ﬁelds is described by the

The main issue here is that the above system of nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations can be solved exactly. There are
two trivial solutions, that appear when one turns oﬀ one
of the two beams. They are the fundamental black soli-
tons u1(x) = ub(x), v1 = 0 and u2 = 0, v2(x) = vb(x),
which reproduce the former solutions (12) and (13). Fur-
thermore, we also have the non-trivial vector soliton, de-

This result is very interesting:
it shows that two black
solitons in interaction inside the silica ﬁber generate a
pair of solitons, one of the black type and the other of
the bright type. In Fig. 2 we depict this non-trivial vector
soliton. It illustrate that the presence of bright soliton
is not a previlege of speciﬁc ﬁbers, that have anoma-
lous group-velocity dispersion. We may say that the sec-
ond laser beam see the normal group-velocity dispersion
of the medium as an anomalous one, and this appear
through the presence of the ﬁrst laser beam, which is
responsable for changing the group-velocity dispersion
inside the ﬁber. This phenomenon is new, and follows
from the vector soliton (20) and (21). We notice that

the vector soliton only exists for r
(0, 1/2), and the
limit r
1/2 leads us back to the scalar soliton ub(x).

This model has the property that the limit r
ial. This limit leads to the symmetric situation, which
can be investigated after rotating the the (u, v) plane to
(u+, u−), with u± = u
v. These transformations fac-
torate the two-ﬁeld system into two degenerate systems
of a single ﬁeld, that support no vector ﬁeld solutions of
the black and bright type. This shows that our model is
asymmetric by construction, and the limit r
1 leads
to a trivial symmetric model.

The presence of the nontrivial black-bright vector soli-

The fact that the pair of second order equations (18) and
(19) can be integrated to give the above pair of ﬁrst or-
der equations (22) and (23) is fundamental, since it is
easier to integrate.
In Field Theory this identiﬁes the
Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld bound [31]; the solu-
tions are stable and minimize the energy of the system
[28,29].

We solve the ﬁrst order equations using the trial or-
bit method introduced in Ref. [32]. We try the orbit
u2 + av2 = 1, for a being some real constant. We
diﬀerentiate this expression and we use the ﬁrst order
equations (22) and (23) to obtain u2 + r(1 + 2a)v2 = 1.
This is compatible with the previous choice if and only if
a = r/(1

easily. The result gives the solution (20). The other
solution (21) is obtained immediately from the orbit (24)
obeyed by u and v.

We have found the vector soliton as a solution of the
pair of ﬁrst order equations (22) and (23). The procedure
involves two steps: the ﬁrst consists in transforming the
pair of second order diﬀerential equations (18) and (19)
into a pair of ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations; the sec-
ond step deals with the trial orbit method introduced in
Ref. [32]. The trial orbit method was introduced to help
solving second order equations of motion for relativistic
systems of coupled scalar ﬁelds. In the present context,
the eﬀectiveness of the trial orbit method is direct, since
we can use the ﬁrst order equations themselves to check
if the orbit we trial is good, that is, if the trial orbit does
not contradict the ﬁrst order equations that follow from
the equations of motions. This check is immediate, and
provides a direct trial for the eligibility of the orbit under
investigation. This fact does not appear in the original
proposal, in Ref. [32], since there one investigated second
order diﬀerential equations.

We see that when the potential is written in terms of
W (u, v), in the form (16), the two equations of motion
are written as

d2u
dx2 = WuWuu + WvWvu
d2v
dx2 = WuWuv + WvWvv

(25)

(26)

where Wu = ∂W/∂u, etc. We associate to these equa-
tions the pair of ﬁrst order equations du/dx = Wu and
dv/dx = Wv. We diﬀerentiate these ﬁrst order equations
to see that their solutions also solve the equations of mo-
tion. Thus, we can concentrate on the simpler task of
solving ﬁrst order equations to get solutions to the sec-
ond order equations. This is an important advantage, but
it is restricted to work when the composite vector soliton
presents nontrivial topological feature, as happens with
dark solitons. This is not the case for bright solitons, that
engender trivial topological behavior. Thus we may wan-
der if it is possible to use two bright solitons to generate
a composite, bright-black vector soliton. However, be-
cause the bright solitons are nontopological they cannot
appear as solutions of ﬁrst order equations, as recently
shown in Ref. [33].

We analyze the resonant linear and nonlinear transmission through a photonic crystal waveg-
uide side-coupled to a Kerr-nonlinear photonic crystal resonator. Firstly, we extend the standard
coupled-mode theory analysis to photonic crystal structures and obtain explicit analytical expres-
sions for the bistability thresholds and transmission coeﬃcients which provide the basis for a detailed
understanding of the possibilities associated with these structures. Next, we discuss limitations of
standard coupled-mode theory and present an alternative analytical approach based on the eﬀective
discrete equations derived using a Green’s function method. We ﬁnd that the discrete nature of the
photonic crystal waveguides allows a novel, geometry-driven enhancement of nonlinear eﬀects by
shifting the resonator location relative to the waveguide, thus providing an additional control of res-
onant waveguide transmission and Fano resonances. We further demonstrate that this enhancement
may result in the lowering of the bistability threshold and switching power of nonlinear devices by
several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that employing such enhancements is of paramount
importance for the design of all-optical devices based on slow-light photonic crystal waveguides.

INTRODUCTION

It is believed that future integrated photonic circuits
for ultrafast all-optical signal processing require diﬀerent
types of nonlinear functional elements such as switches,
memory and logic devices. Therefore, both novel physics
and novel designs of such all-optical devices have at-
tracted signiﬁcant research eﬀorts during the last two
decades, and most of these studies utilize the concepts of
optical switching and bistability [1].

One of the simplest bistable optical devices which can
ﬁnd applications in photonic integrated circuits is a two-
port device which is connected to other parts of a circuit
by one input and one output waveguide. Its transmis-
sion properties depend on the intensity of light sent to
the input waveguide. Two basic realizations of such a
device can be provided by either direct or side-coupling
between the input and output waveguides to an optical
resonator. In the ﬁrst case, we obtain a system with res-
onant transmission in a narrow frequency range, while in
the second case, we obtain a system with resonant reﬂec-
tion. Both systems may exhibit optical bistability when
the resonator is made of a Kerr nonlinear material. The
resonant two-port systems of the ﬁrst type, with direct-
coupled resonator, can be realized in one-dimensional
systems, and they have been studied in great details in
the context of diﬀerent applications. In contrast, the res-
onant systems of the second type, with side-coupled res-
onators, can only be realized in higher-dimensional struc-
tures, and their functionalities are not yet completely un-
derstood.

Our goal in this paper is to study in detail the sec-

ond class of resonant systems based on straight optical
waveguides side-coupled to resonators as shown in Fig. 1.
Moreover, we assume that the waveguide and resonator
are created in two- or three-dimensional photonic crystal
(PhC) [2]. Due to a periodic modulation of the refractive
index of PhCs, such structures may possess complete pho-
tonic band gaps, i.e. regions of optical frequencies where
PhCs act as ideal optical insulators. Embedding carefully
designed cavities into PhCs, one can create ultra-compact
photonic crystal devices which are very promising for ap-
plications in photonic integrated circuits. As an illustra-
tion, side-coupled waveguide-resonator systems created
in PhCs through arrays of cavities are schematically de-
picted in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c).

Practical applications of such PhC devices are becom-
ing a reality due to the recent experimental success in
realizing both linear and nonlinear light transmission in
two-dimensional PhC slab structures where a lattice of
cylindrical pores is etched into a planar waveguide. In
particular, Noda’s group have realized coupling of a PhC
waveguide to a leaky resonator mode consisting of a
defect pore of slightly increased radius [3–6]; Smith et
al. demonstrated coupling of a three-line PhC waveg-
uide with a large-area hexagonal resonator [7]; Seassal
et al. have investigated the mutual coupling of a PhC
waveguide with a rectangular microresonator [8]; No-
tomi et al.
[10] have observed
all-optical bistability in direct-coupled PhC waveguide-
resonator systems.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Three types of the geometries of a
straight photonic-crystal waveguide side-coupled to a non-
linear optical resonator, Aα. Standard coupled-mode the-
ory is based on the geometry (a) which does not account

uides. For instance,

ties and, as a result, may signiﬁcantly enhance the ef-
fective coupling between short pulse and resonators, and
(ii) photonic crystals allow the creation of ultra-compact
high-Q resonators, which are essential for the further
miniaturization of all-optical nanophotonic devices. De-
spite this, many researchers still believe that the basic
properties of devices based on ridge waveguides or PhC
waveguides are qualitatively identical, and that they can
be correctly described by the coupled-mode theory for
continuous systems (see Refs. [11–21] and the discussion
in Sec. II).

However, an inspection of Figs. 1(a-c) reveals, that a
major diﬀerence between the ridge waveguide in (a) and
PhC waveguides in (b,c) is that a PhC waveguide is al-
ways created by an array of coupled small-volume cav-
ities and, therefore, exhibits an inherently discrete na-
ture. This suggests that in these systems an additional
coupling parameter appears which relates the position
of the α-resonator to the waveguide cavities along the
waveguide. As a matter of fact, we may (laterally) place
the α-resonator at any point relative to two succesive
waveguide cavities., thus creating a generally asymmet-
ric device which (in the nonlinear transmission regime)
should exhibit the properties of an optical diode, i.e.,
transmit high-intensity light in one direction only. This
is an intriguing peculiarity of photonic-crystal based de-
vices which we will analyze in a future publication. In
this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to symmetric
structures and study the cases of either on-site coupling of
the α-resonator to the PhC waveguide, shown schemat-
ically in Figs. 1(b), or inter-site coupling, as shown in

2

To address these issues, we employ a recently devel-
oped approach [22–24] and describe the photonic-crystal
devices via eﬀective discrete equations that are derived by
means of a Green’s function formalism [25–29]. This ap-
proach allows us to study the eﬀect of the discrete nature
of the device on its transmission properties. In particular,
we show that the transmission depends on the location
of the resonance frequency ωα of the α-resonator with
respect to the edges of the waveguide passing band. If
ωα lies deep inside the passing band, all devices shown in
Figs. 1(a-c) are qualitatively similar, and can adequately
be described by the conventional coupled-mode theory.
However, if the resonator’s frequency ωα moves closer
to the edge of the passing band, standard coupled-mode
theory fails [30]. More importantly, we show that in
this latter case the properties of the devices shown in
Figs. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c) become qualitatively diﬀerent:
light transmission vanishes at both edges of the passing
band, for the cases shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), but
for the case shown in Fig. 1(c) it remains perfect at one
of the edges. Moreover, the resonance quality factor for
the structure (c) grows indeﬁnitely as ωα approaches this
latter band edge, accordingly reducing the threshold in-
tensity required for a bistable light transmission. This
permits to achieve a very eﬃcient all-optical switching in
the slow-light regime.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we sum-
marize and extend the results of standard coupled-mode
theory which accurately describes the system shown in
Fig. 1(a). Then, in Sec. III.A we derive a system of ef-
fective discrete equations [25, 26] and utilize a recently
developed approach for its analysis [22, 23]. Speciﬁcally,
in Sec. III.B and Sec. III.C, respectively, we study the
two geometries of the waveguide-resonator coupled sys-
tems schematically depicted in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c).
In Sec. IV, we illustrate our main ﬁndings for several
examples of optical devices based on a two-dimensional
photonic crystal created by a square lattice of Si rods. Fi-
nally, in Sec. V we summarize and discuss our results. For
completeness as well as for justiﬁcation of the eﬀective
discrete equations employed, we include in Appendix A
an analysis of simpler cases of uncoupled cavities and
waveguides. The eﬀects of nonlocal waveguide dispersion
and nonlocal waveguide-resonator couplings are brieﬂy
summarized in Appendix B.

II. COUPLED-MODE THEORY

In this Section, we ﬁrst summarize the results of stan-
dard coupled-mode theory and other similar approaches
developed for the analysis of continuous-waveguide struc-
tures similar to those displayed in Fig. 1(a). Then, we
extend these results in order to obtain analytical formu-
las for the description of bistable nonlinear transmission
in such devices.

A. Linear transmission

Transmission of light in waveguide-resonator systems
is usually studied in the linear limit using a coupled-mode
theory based on a Hamiltonian approach. This approach
has been pioneered by Haus and co-workers [11, 12] and
is similar to that used by Fano [13] and Anderson [14] for
describing the interaction between localized resonances
and continuum states in the context of an eﬀect which
is generally referred to as “Fano resonance”. For the
analysis of the transmission of photonic-crystal devices,
this approach has been employed ﬁrst by Fan et al. [15]
and has been elaborated on by Xu et al. [16].

Throughout this paper we consider the propagation of
a monochromatic wave with the frequency ω lying inside
the waveguide passing band; we assume that the waveg-
uide is single-moded as well as that the resonator α is
non-degenerate and losses can be neglected. In this case,
the complex transmission and reﬂection amplitudes, t(ω)
and r(ω), can be written in the form

t(ω) =

r(ω) =

with a certain real-valued and frequency-dependent func-
tion σ(ω) and the reﬂection phase ϕr(ω). Accordingly,

T (ω) =

and R(ω) =

σ2(ω)

,

(2)

and it is easy to see that T + R = 1 for any σ(ω).

If the frequency ωα of the resonator α lies inside the
waveguide passing band, Fano-like resonant scattering
with zero transmission at the resonance frequency ωres,
lying in the vicinity of the resonator’s frequency, ωα,
should be observed [13, 22]. This corresponds to the
condition σ(ωres) = 0 and, based on the terminology de-
veloped in Refs. [17, 18], σ(ω) may be interpreted as the
detuning of the incident frequency from resonance.

The results of standard coupled-mode theory analysis
(for instance, see Ref. [16]) indicate that in the vicinity of
a high-quality (or high-Q) resonance, the detuning func-
tion σ(ω) can be accurately described through the linear
function

which leads to a Lorentzian spectrum. Here, Q is the
quality factor of the resonance mode of the α-resonator.
From the Hamiltonian approach [16], we ﬁnd that the res-
onance frequency ωres almost coincides with the resonator
frequency ωα (see, however, Appendix A in Ref. [19] for
a more accurate estimate of ωres), the reﬂection phase is
ϕr = π/2, and the resonance width γ is determined by
the overlap of the mode proﬁles of waveguide and res-
onator:

Furthermore, εα(~r) and εwg(~r) are the dielectric func-
tions that describe the resonator α and waveguide, re-
spectively. From Eqs. (4)–(5) it is easy to see that the
resonance width γ does not depend on the length L.

However, within the Hamiltonian approach, the func-
tion δε(~r) in Eq. (4) remains undetermined. Generally,
it is assumed to be a diﬀerence between the total dielec-
tric function and the dielectric function ε0(~r) “associated
with the unperturbed Hamiltonian” [16] which is an ill-
deﬁned quantity. A diﬀerent approach based on a per-
turbative solution of the wave equation for the electric
ﬁeld [20] sheds some light on the resolution of this am-
biguity and shows explicitly that ε0(~r) can be taken as
either εwg(~r) or εα(~r).

B. Nonlinear transmission

If the resonator α is made of a Kerr-nonlinear ma-
terial, increasing the intensity of the localized mode of
the resonator leads to a change of the refractive index
and, accordingly, to a shift of the resonator’s resonance
frequency. As a result, the nonlinear light transmission
in this case is described by the same Eqs. (1)–(2), with
the only diﬀerence that the frequency detuning parame-
ter σ(ω) should be replaced by the generalized intensity-
dependent frequency detuning parameter (σ(ω)
− Jα).
Jα is a new dimensionless parameter which is, as
Here,
we show below, proportional to the intensity of the res-
onator’s localized mode. In particular, Eqs. (2) take the
form

low- and high-

for σ2 > 3 (intermediate parts of the curves correspond
to unstable transmission). Therefore, by increasing an

jump from the point (1) to (2), and then upon decreasing

From a practical point of view, these solutions have im-

σ2 > 3 corresponds to a linear transmission T > 3/4.
That is, the bistable transmission becomes possible only
for frequencies where (σ(ω)
· Jα) is positive and linear
transmission exceeds 75%. As demonstrated in Fig. 4
and Eq. (12), when σ2 grows, all threshold intensities
grow, too, starting with the minimum threshold inten-
sity

over, there exists no condition under which T (2) and T (3)
vanish simultaneously. Therefore, it is impossible to cre-
ate ideal nonlinear switches in these systems.

A reasonable compromise for realistic nonlinear switch-

quency with σ2

sion is close to 83%. For this case, the critical trans-

The above analysis suggests that the optimal dimen-

sionless threshold intensities are ﬁxed around
so that the real threshold power of the incoming light,
(i)
P (i)
in , can only be minimized by minimizing the
in = P0J
characteristic power, P0, of the system. An inspection
of Eq. (11) shows that this can be facilitated by increas-
ing the resonator nonlinear feedback parameter, κα, the
material nonlinearity, χ(3)
α , or the resonator quality fac-
tor, Q. For small-volume photonic crystal resonators, it
has been established that κ
0.2 (see [17, 18]), and this
value can hardly be further increased.

∼

Therefore, only two practical strategies remain that
could lead to an enhancement of nonlinear eﬀects in this
system. The ﬁrst approach is based on speciﬁc mate-
rial properties: We should create the resonator α from a
material with the largest possible value of χ(3)
α . In high-
index semiconductors, nearly instantaneous Kerr nonlin-
10−13 cm2/W [31],
earity reaches values of n2 ∼
×
χ(3)/n0 and n0 is the linear refractive index
where n2 ∝
of the material. Even such relatively weak nonlinearity
is already suﬃcient for many experimental observations
of the bistability eﬀect in the waveguide-resonator sys-
tems [9, 10]. However, using polymers with nearly in-
stantaneous Kerr nonlinearity of the order of n2 > 10−11
cm2/W and, at the same time, suﬃciently weak two-
photon absorption [32], one could potentially decrease
the value of P0 by at least two orders of magnitude. Poly-
mers, however, have a low refractive index which is insuf-

1.5

ﬁcient for creating a (linear) photonic bandgap required
to obtain good waveguiding and low losses. The solution
to this could be the embedding of such highly nonlin-
ear but low-index materials into a host photonic crystal
made of a high-index semiconductor. Optimized waveg-
uding designs for the basic functional devices of this kind
are available [33–35] and recent experimental progress
[36, 37] may soon allow a realization of corresponding
linear and nonlinear devices.

The second approach is based on designing waveguide-
resonator structures with the largest possible quality fac-
tor, Q. Potentially, one can increase Q indeﬁnitely by
mere increase of the distance between the waveguide and
the resonator. However, this leads to a corresponding
increase in the size of the nonlinear photonic devices. A
very attractive alternative possibility for increasing Q is
based on the adjustment of the resonator geometry [38].
In what follows, we suggest yet another possibility to
dramatically increase Q through an optimal choice of the
resonator location relative to the discrete locations of the
cavities that form the photonic-crystal waveguide.

C. Limitations of the coupled-mode theory

Standard coupled-mode theory exhibits a number of
limitations. Firstly, it gives analytical expression for the
detuning parameter σ(ω) only near the resonator fre-
quency ωα. And this immediately highlights the second
limitation: standard coupled-mode theory [16–21] can-
not analytically describe resonant eﬀects near waveguide
band edges. However, numerical studies [30] have re-
cently demonstrated that the eﬀects of the waveguide
dispersion become very important at the band edges and
may lead to non-Lorentzian transmission spectra in cou-
pled waveguide-resonator systems.

As a matter of fact, the question “what happens if the
resonator frequency ωα lies near the edge of the waveg-
uide passing band or even outside it?” may be of a great
practical importance due to two reasons. Firstly, in real-
istic structures it is not always possible to appropriately
tune the frequency ωα, and therefore it is important to
understand properties of the system for any location of
the resonance frequency. Secondly, as we have already
mentioned in the Introduction, PhC waveguides can pro-
vide us with a very slow group velocity of the propagating
pulses — but in most cases they do it exactly at the pass-
ing band edges. Therefore, if we wish to utilize such a
slow light propagation for nonlinearity enhancement, we
should extend the above analysis to such cases, too.

In what follows, we describe an alternative analyti-
cal approach to the coupled waveguide-resonator struc-
tures which allows us to correctly analyze both linear
and nonlinear transmission for arbitrary locations of the
resonator frequency ωα relative to the waveguide passing
band, including the transmission near band edges in the
slow light regime.

III. DISCRETE MODEL APPROACH

results obtained for

Having discussed the

the
continuous-waveguide structure shown in Fig. 1(a), we
now take into account the discrete nature of the waveg-
uding structure embedded in photonic crystals. In par-
ticular, we analyze what will change in the system prop-
erties when we move the resonator along the waveguide
from the on-site location shown in Fig. 1(b) to the inter-
site location shown in Fig. 1(c). Our analysis is based on
eﬀective discrete equations that have been derived for the
description of photonic crystal devices [25–29] in combi-
nation with a recently developed discrete model approach
to nonlinear Fano resonances [22].

A. Discrete Equation Approach

First, we derive an appropriate set of discrete equations
[see Eqs. (24) below], and show that they can be applied
to a variety of the photonic-crystal devices. We start
from the wave equation in the frequency domain for the
electric ﬁeld

everywhere except for areas inside and in the vicinity of
cavities. We enumerate the cavities by an integer index

scribe the shape of the n-th cavity. As a result, δ ˆε(~r)

in Eqs. (21)–(23) we have used more accurate deﬁnitions
of the coupling coeﬃcients than those that have been in-
troduced earlier in Refs. [26–29]. They have also a more
generic form than those we used in Ref. [25].

Typical frequency dependencies of the parameters of
the discrete model, Eq. (21), are displayed in Figs. 9–
11 of Appendix A, where we also discuss the application
of Eqs. (21)–(23) to simple structures such as linear and
nonlinear photonic crystal resonators and straight waveg-
uides. Here, we apply Eqs. (21)–(23) to study the more
complicated case of the nonlinear coupled waveguide-
resonator systems shown in Figs. 1(b,c). The set of
Eqs. (21) may be separated in this case according to

where s is the distance between the nearest waveguide

For both structures shown in Figs. 1(b,c), we obtain that
the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients can formally
be described by the same expressions (1)–(2) as for the
structure depicted in Fig. 1(a). However, within the dis-
crete equation approach the expression for the detuning
parameter σ(ω) can now be found for the entire frequency
range. Below, we discuss novel results for the structures
shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c) separately.

B. On-site resonator

First, we obtain the solution of this problem for the
structure shown in Fig. 1(b). For simplicity, we as-
sume that the only nonvanishing coupling coeﬃcients in
Eq. (24) are V1w(ω), Vα,0(ω), and V0,α(ω) (see, however,
Appendix B for a more accurate analysis which takes into
account additional coupling coeﬃcients). As a result,
we obtain the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients de-
scribed by Eqs. (1)–(2) with φr = π/2 and a correspond-
ing expression for σ(ω):

σ(ω) = 2 sin [k(ω)s]

which should be considered as a generalized intensity-

is given by

A0 = t(ω) I 1/2

(27)

while the waveguide dispersion relation k(ω) is deter-
mined by Eq. (A6).

In the case of a linear α-resonator (i.e. χ(3)
α

0),
the amplitude Aα = Vα,0(ω)A0/Dα(ω) is proportional to
the amplitude A0. Therefore, σ(ω) and, accordingly, the
transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients do not depend on
the light intensity. Upon introducing the abbreviation

the detuning parameter, Eq. (26), for a linear α-resonator
reads as

quency dependence are evaluated at the resonance fre-
quency, ωres. Finally, we notice that the resonance width,
Eq. (30), is very similar to that described by the coupled-

is multiplied by the factor sin [k(ωα)s]
vgr, and, there-
fore, becomes strongly suppressed near the edges of
π/s. Accordingly,
waveguide passing band, k(ωα) = 0,
the detuning parameter (29) vanishes at these edges, too.
This means that, in agreement with the numerical calcu-
lations shown in Fig. 5, the transmission coeﬃcient T (ω)
vanishes not only at the resonance frequency, but also at
both edges of the waveguide passing band. Such an eﬀect
was recently observed by Waks and Vukovic [30] in their
numerical calculations based on standard coupled-mode
theory which takes into account the waveguide disper-
sion. Therefore, the eﬀect of vanishing transmission at
the spectral band edges may be attributed also to the
structure shown in Fig. 1(a).

Obviously, this enhancement of light scattering at the
waveguide band edges should be very important from the
point of view of fabrication tolerances since virtually any
imperfection contributes to scattering losses. Moreover,
as discussed in Sec. IV, this eﬀect is detrimental to the
concept of all-optical switching devices based on slow-
light photonic crystal waveguides.

We support this conclusion by another observation.

which may signiﬁcantly exceed the incoming light inten-
sity Iin when the coupling V0,α between the α-resonator
and waveguide becomes small enough relative to the cou-
pling V1w between the cavities in the waveguide. This
strong enhancement suggests a physical explanation for
the existence of the rather strong nonlinear eﬀect of light
bistability at relatively low intensities of the incoming
light. However, when the resonance frequency ωα lies
close to any of the waveguide band edges, it is seen from
Eq. (34) that the light intensity at the α-resonator be-
comes (strongly) suppressed by a factor sin2[k(ωα)s] .

Details of an extension of the above discussion to the
case of more realistic non-local couplings, i.e., more than
nearest neighbors couplings, is presented in Appendix B
and here we only summarize the results. Both, a non-
locality of the inter-coupling between waveguide cavities
as well as a nonlocality of cross-coupling with the α-
resonator lead to a small shift in the resonance frequency,
ωres, but do not change the main result about the sup-
pression of the detuning σ(ω) and transmission T (ω) at
both edges of the waveguide passing band. However, we
would like to emphasize that for a fully quantitative anal-
ysis, non-local couplings have to be taken into account,
for instance, within the framework of the recently devel-

oped Wannier function approach [39].

We now consider the case when the resonator α is non-
linear, i.e. χ(3)
= 0. As has been previously shown
α
in Ref. [22], this case, too, can be studied analytically
even for non-local couplings between the cavities and
resonator and novel eﬀects originating solely from the
non-locality may be expected when the non-local cou-
pling strength exceeds one half of the local coupling. Un-
fortunately, in realistic photonic crystals this limit may
hardly be realized so that here we restrict our analysis to
the local-coupling approximation. In this case, we obtain
from the second equation in Eqs. (24) that the amplitude
Aα uniquely determines the amplitude A0. Substituting
the latter expression into Eqs. (26)–(27), we ﬁnd that
the nonlinear transmission is described by Eqs. (6) and
(9) with the detuning σ(ω) determined by Eqs. (28)–(29)
and the dimensionless intensities

results for the nonlinear light transmission which are dis-

In an experiment, one measures not the light inten-
sity in the waveguide, Iin, but the propagation power,

Again, this result is quite similar to Eq. (11) for the con-

general analysis explicitly suggests that it should be bet-
ter to use the α-resonator with the resonance frequency at
the center of the waveguide passing band k(ωα)
π/2s,
where the group velocity reaches its maximum. No-
tice, however, that this suggestion becomes wrong for
the structure of Fig. 1(c) studied in the next subsection.

therefore, couples equally to both of them, a qualitatively

responding structure is schematically shown in Fig. 1(c).

Again, in contrast to the corresponding light intensity
(34) for the on-site coupled structure, Eq. (42) does not
vanish at the edge of the transmission band k =
π/s.
Therefore, we can expect that for inter-site coupled struc-
ture nonlinear eﬀects at the band edge k =

be suﬃciently strong to allow bistable transmission and
switching.

slow-light photonic crystal waveguides. This is in sharp

IV. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

In this section, we summarize our results and em-
phasize their importance by applying them to spe-
ciﬁc photonic-crystal structures. We consider a two-
dimensional photonic crystal created by a square lattice
of dielectric rods in air. The rods are made from Si or
GaAs (ε = 11.56) and have radius r = 0.18a.

First, we consider a waveguide created by removing
every second rod (s = 2a) in a straight line of rods cou-
pled to a nonlinear resonator α created by replacing a
single rod of the two-dimensional lattice with a highly-
nonlinear polymer rod. The corresponding structure is
schematically shown in the insets in Fig. 7. The resonant

scribed in Appendix A 1 and results for three diﬀerent values
of the resonator dielectric constant εα are shown.

π/s of the waveguide passing band, and
the edge k =

±

In Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively, we display the trans-
mission spectra for both on-site and inter-site positions
of the side-coupled resonator for three diﬀerent values of
resonator dielectric constant εα. We notice that in the
case of the on-site position of the resonator the trans-
mission coeﬃcient T (ω) remains below the critical value
of T = 75% required for bistable switching operation
for all frequencies ω below the resonance frequency ωres.
The condition ω < ωres corresponds to the condition
· Jα) > 0 which should be satisﬁed to realize non-
(σ(ω)
monotonic dependencies of the nonlinear transmission
shown in Fig. 4). Therefore, this on-site system cannot
exhibit bistability.

On the other hand, bistability may be realized for the
inter-site position of the side-coupled resonator for which,
in a full agreement with our analysis presented above, the
transmission remains perfect at the band edge k =
π/s
and the quality factor Q increases as the resonant fre-
quency approaches this band edge. In Fig. 8(b) (exam-
ple A) we show that in this case bistable transmission
indeed occurs for the frequency marked by a ﬁlled circle
in Fig. 8(a). This corresponds to T (ω) = 80%, i.e., the
choice σ2(ω) = 4 for the detuning parameter.

±

We want to emphasize that the large value of the qual-
ity factor (41) for the inter-site structure at k(ω) close to
π/s leads to very low bistability thresholds as compared
±
to the cases of on-site coupled and continous waveguide

coupled structures. This is illustrated in examples B
and C of Fig. 8: Relative to the waveguide design in ex-
ample A, the design in example B moves the resonance
frequency deeper into the passing band thus decreasing
the quality factor (41). Nevertheless, the inter-site cou-
pled example B still exhibits a much smaller bistability
threshold than the on-site coupled system with the same
waveguide design in example C. This is caused by (usu-
ally) much smaller waveguide-resonator coupling and, ac-
cordingly, much larger Q in the inter-site structures as
compared to the on-site structures.

Summarizing, the inter-site structure of the resonant
waveguide-resonator interaction schematically shown in

11

Fig. 1(c) allows to achieve much higher values for the
linear quality factor Q. As a consequence, much smaller
bistability threshold intensities for the nonlinear trans-
mission are obtained. To employ these advantages, the
wavevector k(ωres) of the guided mode at the resonance
frequency ωres, Eq. (39), should be as close as possible to
π/s. This requirement coincides with the condition of a
very small group velocity in the waveguide and, in con-
trast to the continuous-waveguide and on-site structures
depicted in Figs. 1(a,b), provides us with a possibility to
create low-threshold all-optical switching devices based
on slow-light photonic crystal waveguides.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a detailed analysis of PhC waveg-
uides side-coupled to Kerr nonlinear resonators which
may serve as a basic element of active photonic-crystal
circuitry. First, we have extended the familiar approach
based on standard coupled-mode theory and derived ex-
plicit analytical expressions for the bistability thresholds
and transmission coeﬃcients related to light switching in
such structures. Our results reveal that, from the point
of view of bistability contrast (a small diﬀerence between
two threshold intensities and robustness of switching) the
best conditions for bistability are realized for those pa-
rameter values for which the dimensionless detuning pa-
rameter σ(ω) is close to √5. Practically, this corresponds
to the choice of operation frequencies for which the linear
light transmission is close to 83%.

We have pointed out that the conventional coupled-
mode theory does not allow to describe the light trans-
mission near the band edges, and we have developed an
improved semi-analytical approach based on the eﬀective
discrete equations derived in the framework of a consis-
tent Green’s function formalism. This approach is ideally
suited for a qualitative and semi-quantitative description
of photonic-crystal devices that involve a discrete set of
small-volume cavities. We have shown that this novel
approach allows to adequately describe light transmis-
sion in the waveguide-resonator structures near the band
edges. Speciﬁcally, we have demonstrated that while the
transmission coeﬃcient vanishes at both spectral edges
for the on-site coupled structure (see Fig. 1(b)), light
transmission remains perfect at one band edge for the
inter-site coupled structure (see Fig. 1(c)). These fea-
tures allow a signiﬁcant enhancement of the resonator
quality factor and, accordingly, a substantial reduction
of the bistability threshold. As a consequence, we refer
to this type of nonlinearity enhancement as a geomet-
ric enhancement. The possibility of such enhancement is
a direct consequence of the discreteness of the photonic
crystal waveguide and is in a sharp contrast to similar
resonant systems based on ridge waveguides. The poten-
tial of this novel type of the nonlinearity enhancement
may be regarded as an additional argument to support
the application of photonic-crystal devices in integrated

photonic circuits.

In addition, we would like to emphasize that the engi-
neering of the geometry of photonic-crystal based devices
such as that presented in Fig. 1(c) becomes extremely
useful for developing novel concepts of all-optical switch-
ing in the slow-light regime of PhC waveguides which may
have much wider applications in nanophotonics and is
currently under active experimental research [40].

We believe that the basic concept of the geometric en-
hancement of nonlinear eﬀects based on the discrete na-
ture of photonic-crystal waveguides will be useful in the
study of more complicated devices and circuits and, in
particular, for various slow-light applications. For in-
stance, this concept may be applied to the transmission
of a side-coupled resonator placed between two partially
reﬂecting elements embedded into the photonic-crystal
waveguide where sharp and asymmetric line shapes have
been predicted with associated variations of the transmis-
sion from 0% to 100% over narrow frequency ranges [41].
Similarly, the concept can be extended to a system of
cascaded cavities [42] and three-port channel-drop ﬁl-
ters [43], optical delay lines [44], systems of two nonlinear
resonators with a very low bistability threshold [45], etc.

1. Coupling coeﬃcients for two-dimensional
photonic crystals

To obtain deeper insight into the basic properties of
the eﬀective discrete equations (21), we should know how
the coupling coeﬃcients Dn(ω), κn(ω), and Vn,m(ω) de-
pend on frequency ω. As an illustration, we consider a
two-dimensional model of a photonic crystal consisting
of a square lattice (lattice spacing a) of inﬁnitely long
dielectric rods (see Refs.
[15, 17, 18] and also references
[7-16] in Ref. [25]). We study light propagation in the
plane of periodicity, assuming that the rods have a radius
r = 0.18a and a dielectric constant of εrod = 11.56 (GaAs
or Si at the telecommunication wavelength λ
1.55 µm).
For light with the electric ﬁeld polarized along the rods
(E-polarized light), this photonic crystal exhibits a large

ing a single rod with a polymer rod of the same ra-

Here, we have used the notation κn = κn(ωn). As we see,
the nonlinear sensitivity of the resonator at the site n is

the Kerr susceptibility of material, χ(3)

the coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) sug-
gested in Ref. [46]. If we neglect nonlinear eﬀects (assum-
ing that either the waveguide cavities are linear, χ(3)

mate results are obtained from Eq. (A5) with L = 1 (dotted

where we assume that the coupling coeﬃcients Vjw(ω)
vanish for all j above L. As a matter of fact, our studies
indicate that suﬃciently accurate results can be obtained
already for L
4a/s. In Fig. 12 we plot the dispersion
relation for a 2D model photonic-crystal waveguide and
compare it with exact numerical results calculated by the
super-cell plane-wave method [47]. For this case, even
the simplest tight-binding approximation (i.e., at L = 1)
gives quite satisfactory results.

INTERACTIONS

1. Eﬀects of nonlocal dispersion

As follows from the results of Sec. III B above, the
local-coupling approximation provides us with an ex-
cellent qualitative analysis of the structure shown in
Fig. 1(b). However, certain physically important eﬀects
may be missed in this approximation. A detailed anal-
ysis of the eﬀects of nonlocal coupling was performed in
Ref. [22], so that here we may discuss this issue very
brieﬂy, and may specify it directly to photonic-crystal
devices.

In Fig. 5, we provide a comparison of T (ω) calculated
from Eq. (29) in the local-coupling approximation with
the exact numerical results for the structure shown in
Fig. 1(b) for the model photonic crystal described in Ap-
pendix A 1. The results suggest that the local-coupling
approximation introduces a frequency shift for the band
edges which agrees well with the corresponding frequency
shift in the dispersion relation shown in Fig. 12.

In addition, the resonance frequency is also shifted; it
is not equal to ωα but is slightly larger. In principle, this
shift can be produced by two eﬀects: (i) a long-range
coupling between cavities inside the waveguide and (ii) a
long-range coupling between the waveguide and the side-
coupled resonator. First, we explore the former possibil-
ity.

Solving Eqs. (24)–(25) for L = 2, we obtain the trans-
mission and reﬂection coeﬃcients (1)–(2) with the detun-
ing parameter

Fig. 5 shows that the transmission calculated from
Eq. (B1) is much closer to the exact numerical results.
In fact, the nominator of Eq. (B1) indicates that, indeed,
the resonance frequency is slightly shifted from the value

ωα, and that this shift is proportional to V2w. Since V2w is
always much smaller than V1w (see Fig. 11), we can safely
neglect all the terms proportional to V n

Here, the values of all coeﬃcients are calculated at the

In addition to the shift of the resonance frequency,
a perfect transmission may occur at the frequencies for
which the denominator in Eq. (B1) vanishes:

appears to be impossible to realize in realistic photonic

2. Eﬀects of nonlocal coupling

Another possible reason for a shift of the resonance
frequency is a nonlocal coupling between the waveguide
cavities and the side-coupled resonator α. Here, we dis-
cuss this eﬀect in the framework of the tight-binding ap-
proximation for the waveguide dispersion (i.e., L = 1)
to distinguish it from the other type of nonlocal eﬀects
discussed in the previous sub-section. We assume that
Vj,α(ω) = Vα,j (ω) = 0 for all j
2, and take into account
that, for the symmetric structure shown in Fig. 1(b),
V1,α(ω) and
the coupling coeﬃcients are: V−1,α(ω)
Vα,−1(ω)
Vα,1(ω). Then, we obtain a solution of
Eqs. (24)–(25) in the form of Eqs. (1)–(2) with the de-
tuning parameter deﬁned as

(cid:3)

Here, all coeﬃcients are assumed to be frequency-
dependent, similar to Eqs. (28)-(29).
Furthermore,
the waveguide dispersion k(ω) is calculated again from
Eq. (A6).

Eq. (B4) suggests that in this case the resonance
frequency becomes slightly shifted from the value ωα,
and this shift is proportional to the values of V1,α and
Vα,1, which for our example (see Fig. 5) are equal to
Vα,1 =
0.0022. Assuming that
these coupling coeﬃcients are always much smaller than
V0,α and Vα,0 (cf. Vα,0 = 0.096 and V0,α = 0.082), we
obtain for the resonance frequency

0.0026 and V1,α =

(B5)

(cid:19)

Here, the coeﬃcients are calculated at the resonance fre-
quency ωα, and να is deﬁned by Eq. (A1). For the exam-
ple shown in Fig. 5, this frequency shift is much smaller
than that described by Eq. (B2) because in this case the
values of Vα,1 and V1,α are 3.3 times smaller than the
value of V2w.

Due to this long-range coupling, there appears a pos-
sibility of perfect light transmission, as discussed in
Vα,1(ω)
Ref. [22], but only in the case when

/2. Again, such
V0,α(ω)
exceeds
V1,α(ω)

a scenario appears to be impossible to realize in realistic
photonic crystal structures.

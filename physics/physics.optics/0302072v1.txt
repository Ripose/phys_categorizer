Abstract. We study the class of endlessly single-mode all-silica photonic
crystal ﬁbers with a triangular air-hole cladding. We consider the sensibility
to longitudinal nonuniformities and the consequences and limitations for realizing
low-loss large-mode area photonic crystal ﬁbers. We also discuss the dominating
scattering mechanism and experimentally we conﬁrm that both macro and micro-
bending can be the limiting factor.

1. Introduction

Since the ﬁrst results on photonic crystal ﬁbers [1, 2] (PCF) many exciting phenomena
have been reported (for recent reviews see e.g. Refs. [3, 4, 5]). All-silica PCFs
with a triangular air-hole cladding (see inset of Fig. 1) have a big technological
potential due to their endlessly single-mode properties [6] combined with (in principle)
unlimited large eﬀective areas [7]. However, it is well-known that scattering losses and
conﬁnement losses may put an important limit to the eﬀective areas that can be
realized [6, 8, 9, 10]. In this paper we present very general results for the inﬂuence of
longitudinal perturbations of the ﬁber axis on the loss and discuss how it correlates
with the eﬀective area Aeﬀ and air-hole diameter. We also discuss important sources
for the longitudinal perturbations and argue that macro-bending is not the only
limiting factor in achieving low-loss ﬁbers with large eﬀective areas.

2. Elastic scattering from the fundamental mode to the cladding

The general phenomena of mode coupling from the fundamental mode to the cladding,
which leads to attenuation of the light guided by the ﬁber, may be treated as an elastic
scattering process. For single-mode ﬁbers the scattering rate out of the mode can be
expressed by a Fermi’s golden rule expression (see e.g. Ref. [11])

where ∆βm = β − βm is the transferred momentum with {β1, β2, . . .} being cladding
modes, i.e. modes not tightly conﬁned to the core. Here, Wm(∆βm) is the matrix
element between the unperturbed guided mode and the mth cladding mode for a

given coupling mechanism. Scattering by longitudinal perturbations such as macro-
bending, micro-bending, Bragg gratings, or dielectric imperfections are examples of
elastic scattering processes covered by Eq. (1). In Eq. (1) a complete and orthogonal
set of eigenmodes is assumed which is strictly speaking only fulﬁlled in the limit of
vanishing absorption and conﬁnement loss. However, also for the practical situation
with weak absorption and conﬁnement loss the analysis to follow is still quantitative
correct as long as we for β = β′ + iβ′′ have that β′′ ≪ β′.

For the continuum of cladding modes there is a lower bound βcl on their
propagation constants, i.e. βm ≤ βcl. For a homogeneous cladding material of index
ncl one would typically have βcl = nclk and in a micro-structured cladding one can in
a similar way deﬁne a fundamental space-ﬁlling mode [16] with propagation constant
βcl. In Eq. (1) the ﬁnite ∆β ≡ β − βcl thus cuts oﬀ the eﬀects of long-length-scale
non-uniformities. From the corresponding coupling length (or beat length)

and the characteristic length scale of a speciﬁc perturbation, Ln, a generalized low-loss
criterion can thus be formulated [12] where losses will be signiﬁcant only if

zc = 2π/∆β

λ/neﬀ . Ln . zc.

Otherwise, if Ln < λ/neﬀ, the rapid-varying perturbation is eﬀectively reduced by the
averaging over the wavelength, or if Ln > zc the perturbation is suﬃciently slow to
act as an adiabatic tapering-like process. As emphasized in Ref. [12] the criterion in
Eq. (3) does not quantify loss, but it gives a correct parametric dependence of loss
for various loss mechanisms. In order to quantify loss accurately one would need to
know the matrix elements in Eq. (1) for the full set of cladding modes and for all
the scattering mechanisms at action.
In this work we will rather use the criterion
in Eq. (3) to gain more general insight in the susceptibility of PCFs to longitudinal
non-uniformities.

Recently, Eq. (3) was used to identify improved large-mode area PCF designs [13]
and for analysis of micro-bending induced scattering loss [14]. The formalism has also
been used in a study of structural long-period gratings in PCFs with Ln being the
period of the gratings [15]. Below we discuss three important scattering mechanisms
in more detail.

2.1. Macro-bending losses

For macro-bending loss it can be shown that [12]

where we have omitted a numerical prefactor. While this expression may seem too
simplistic we ﬁnd that it fully accounts for our experimental data.

For PCFs the wavelength dependence of β and βcl (see e.g. Ref. [16]) gives rise to
both a long-wavelength bend-edge (as in standard ﬁbers) and also a short-wavelength
bend-edge [6, 8]. For the short-wavelength bend-edge Eqs. (3) and (4) can be used
to show that Rc ∝ λ−2 [6] which has been conﬁrmed experimentally for a particular
ﬁber design [6].

d/Λ = 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, and 0.45. The inset illustrates the dielectric structure in a
cross section of the PCF.

2.2. Micro-bending losses

Micro-bending may be thought of as small and arbitrarily spaced bends of the ﬁber
axis caused by external or frozen-in mechanical deformations. Typically, the power
spectra of the deformations are very broadband, but because of the stiﬀness of the
ﬁber there is an eﬀective cut-oﬀ such that the ﬁber is only susceptible to deformations
with periods, Lmicro

, limited by [17]

L

n

> r(πEf /Ec)

.

(6)

Here, r is the ﬁber radius and Ef and Ec are the Young’s moduli of the ﬁber material
and the coating material, respectively. The cut-oﬀ given above relies on a simpliﬁed
model, but essentially states that it is hard to mechanically deform the ﬁber with a
period shorter than the ﬁber diameter itself.

2.3. Scattering by dielectric imperfections

While macro and microbending induced deformations can be considered extrinsic
sources, dielectric imperfections act as an intrinsic source which is present even when
the ﬁber is not perturbed from the outside.
Index variations of the silica, surface
roughness at the air-silica interfaces, strain, and spatial variations in ﬁber diameter
and air-hole diameters are examples of dielectric imperfections. From a fabrication
point of view the goal is to limit index ﬂuctuations i) to the sub-wavelength scale where
e.g. Rayleigh scattering is a weak source of loss compared to the other mechanisms
treated here and/or ii) to a long-scale adiabatic behavior, see Eq. (3). As demonstrated
recently it is possible to limit scattering by dielectric imperfections signiﬁcantly by
careful fabrication of the PCF [19].

3. The eﬀective area

The spatial extension of the mode is of great importance to several applications.
For non-linear applications one would like to have a very conﬁned mode (transverse
extension comparable to the wavelength) whereas for high-power applications one
would typically prefer a large mode (transverse extension much larger than the
wavelength) to avoid non-linear eﬀects and material damage.
In order to quantify
the transverse extension we consider the eﬀective area [20, 21]

where I(r⊥) is the transverse intensity distribution of the fundamental mode. For a
Gaussian mode of width w Eq. (7) gives Aeﬀ = πw2 and the intensity distribution in
this type of PCF can be considered close to Gaussian [21, 22].

4. Numerical results

The fully-vectorial eigenmodes of Maxwell’s equations are computed with periodic
boundary conditions in a planewave basis [23]. This approach provides the eigenmodes
on a discrete lattice and the integrals in Eq. (7) are then obtained by sums over lattice
sites inside the super-cell. For the dielectric function we use ε = 1 for the air holes and
ε = (1.444)2 = 2.085 for the silica. Ignoring the frequency dependence of the latter
the wave equation becomes scale-invariant [24] and all the results to be presented can
thus be scaled to the desired value of Λ.

In Fig. 1 we show the coupling length, Eq. (2), as a function of wavelength for
diﬀerent air-hole diameters. In general the coupling length decreases with increasing

Wavelength [nm]

Figure 3. The transmission (linear scale) is plotted as a function of wavelength,
for seven diﬀerent bending radii of the ﬁber. The total bend of the ﬁber was 450
degrees on a dorn, and the transmission spectra were normalized to a straight
ﬁber. The vertical lines correspond to a total decrease of the transmission of 5
dB, 10 dB and 15 dB respectively.

air-hole diameter indicating less scattering loss for increasing air-hole diameter. For
d/Λ = 0.3 the coupling length has a minimum at λ/Λ ∼ 0.5. This minimum shifts
toward higher wavelengths when increasing the hole diameter. For the endlessly single-
mode limit d/Λ ∼ 0.45 (see Ref. [18] for a discussion of the particular value of this
number) the minimum is at λ/Λ ∼ 0.8. The occurrence of a minimum also indicates
both a short wavelength and long wavelength loss edge as has been reported for macro-
bending loss [6, 8]. The position of the minimum conﬁrms the results of Ref. [8] where
to a ﬁrst approximation minimum bend-loss was found to occur at λ ∼ Λ/2. The
general picture is that when moving away from this minimum toward the large-mode
area regime (λ ≪ Λ) or the small-core (nonlinear) regime (λ ∼ Λ) the PCF becomes
more susceptible to longitudinal non-uniformities. It is interesting to note that the
recently reported PCF (Λ ∼ 4.2 µm and d/Λ ∼ 0.44) by Farr et al. [19] showed
record-low loss at λ = 1550 nm. Comparing to Fig. 1 the coupling length at the
corresponding value λ/Λ ∼ 0.4 is not very diﬀerent from its minimum value (note
the logarithmic scale) which indicates a close-to-minimal susceptibility to longitudinal
non-uniformities for that ﬁber.

Calculating the eﬀective area, Eq. (7), as a function of wavelength [21] and
combining the data with that of Fig. 1 we get the plot of eﬀective area versus coupling
length shown in Fig. 2. For the short-wavelength limit (λ ≪ Λ) we in general ﬁnd
that the coupling length increases with increasing eﬀective area, i.e.
for increasing
eﬀective area the PCF in general becomes more sensitive to scattering.

from Fig. 3, the dashed line shows a linear ﬁt verifying the Rc ∝ λ−2 behavior,
and the solid line shows Rc(λ) → α × Rc(λ) with α ≃ 1.8 as ﬁtting parameter,
see Eq. (5).

5. Experiments

In order to experimentally quantify the diﬀerent loss mechanisms described above we
consider a PCF with Λ ≃ 10 µm and d/Λ ≃ 0.5, see inset of Fig. 4.

The macro bending losses of the ﬁber was characterized in a similar way to the ﬁrst
work on endlessly single-mode photonic crystal ﬁbers [1]. The ﬁber was coiled one and
a quarter turn on seven dorns with diﬀerent radii, and for each dorn the transmission
spectrum was measured using a white light source and an optical spectrum analyzer.
For all radii the launch of the light into the ﬁber was kept ﬁxed, and the spectra were
ﬁnally normalized with a reference spectrum obtained from the same piece of ﬁber
kept straight. The spectra are shown in Fig. 3.

The transmission spectra show a steep cut-oﬀ, which increases in wavelength as
the bending radius decreases. For each radius we have measured the wavelengths
corresponding to a 5 dB, 10 dB, and 15 dB transmission drop through the ﬁber, and
as can be seen from Fig. 3 the three cut-oﬀ conditions occur within a very narrow
wavelength range.
In Fig. 4, the cut-oﬀ wavelengths are plotted as a function of
R−1/2, and in agreement with previous observations [1] a linear relationship is clearly
observed, yielding a ﬁt of (dashed line)

for the particular ﬁber considered. The solid line shows Eq. (5) with the numerical
prefactor adjusted to α ≃ 1.8, i.e. Rc(λ) → α×Rc(λ). Thus, not only does our analysis
predict the correct parametric behavior as in Ref. [1] but a numerical prefactor of the
order unity in Eq. (5) is also conﬁrmed.

Wavelength [nm]

Figure 5. The plot shows the spectral attenuation of the same ﬁber, wound on
three diﬀerent spool radii. The arrows indicate the critical wavelength for bending
losses calculated using the ﬁt shown in Fig. 4.

Finally, in Fig. 5, the spectral attenuation is shown for the same ﬁber wound on
three diﬀerent spool radii of 5.4 cm, 8 cm, and 16 cm. Since the ﬁber length is 100 m
much smaller loss levels may be measured - typically with a precision of 0.001 dB/m.
Also shown in Fig. 5 are the critical wavelengths for macro bending losses, calculated
using the ﬁtted relation above.

5.1. Discussion

The measurements show that in a wavelength range of some hundred nanometers
above the critical wavelength for macrobending losses the attenuation in the ﬁber is
signiﬁcant. E.g. for a radius of 16 cm, the critical wavelength is 284 nm, but up to
620 nm the attenuation is still larger than 0.1 dB/m. This level is much larger than
what would be expected theoretically from the tail of the macro bending edge [8], but
it is still dependent on the bending radius. Hence, the losses in this region are not
due to material losses or scattering on point defects (as can be checked by OTDR
measurements) but are attributed to micro-bending losses. Micro-bending studies as
in Ref. [14] conﬁrm this. As the ﬁber is spooled on smaller diameters it is expected
that the deformation spectrum experienced by the ﬁber will have contributions from
shorter periods, which causes the microbending losses to extend to longer wavelengths
where the beat length is shorter. Furthermore, the spectra coincide for wavelengths
above ≈ 1200 nm, which may be related to the range where the ﬁber is no longer
susceptible to external deformations. Indeed, the wavelength of 1200 nm corresponds
It
to a beat length of ≈ 1 mm, which is in reasonable agreement with Eq. (6).
should be pointed out that Eq. (6) is based on a very simple model of the mechanical
deformation, which actually overestimates the susceptibility to external deformations
because the so-called buﬀer eﬀect of the coating is not taken into account [17].

In fact the ﬁndings described above are very analogous to the properties found for

standard ﬁbers, only the wavelength dependence is reversed. Previously it was shown
that the micro-bending sensitivity of standard ﬁbers increases as the so-called MAC
/λcut−oﬀ, which essentially
value increases [25]. The MAC values is deﬁned as MFD
is a numerical factor times the mode area divided by the index step between the core
and the cladding. Since the index step is constant for a standard solid glass ﬁber and
the mode area increases for increasing wavelengths, the MAC value also increases for
increasing wavelength. However, for the type of PCFs described here, the mode area
is practically constant but the eﬀective index step decreases for decreasing wavelength,
which implies an increasing MAC value for decreasing wavelength.

6. Conclusion

In this paper we have studied, both theoretically and experimentally, the loss
mechanisms due to longitudinal perturbations of all-silica photonic crystal ﬁbers with
a triangular cladding structure. In the endlessly single-mode limit, the coupling length
zc between the fundamental mode and the ﬁrst cladding mode has been calculated for
a range of hole sizes, and zc has been related to both the eﬀective area, the critical
radius for macrobending, and the sensitivity to microbending.
It is found that a
minimum coupling length exists, where the ﬁber is least susceptible to longitudinal
perturbations. The position of the minimum is dependent on the hole size and varies
from λ/Λ ≈ 0.5 for d/Λ = 0.3 to λ/Λ ≈ 0.8 for d/Λ = 0.45, while the minimum
value of zc decreases by almost an order of magnitude from d/Λ = 0.3 to d/Λ = 0.45.
In general zc increases for increasing Aeﬀ/λ2, giving rise to a macrobending edge
for short wavelengths as well as a wavelength range where the ﬁber is potentially
susceptible to microbends on a length scale of several ﬁber diameters, which may easily
be experienced in a practical ﬁber device or cable. Both the macro- and microbending
losses are demonstrated experimentally, and a very good agreement with the calculated
coupling lengths are found.

The results reported here allow for a comparison between single-mode ﬁbers in
the conventional all-glass technology and the endlessly single-mode photonic crystal
ﬁbers, where especially two points should be stressed. First of all, the low loss
criterion formulated in Ref. [12] based on the coupling length between the fundamental
In practice however,
mode and the cladding also holds for photonic crystal ﬁbers.
the wavelength scale is reversed compared to standard ﬁbers, so both macro and
microbending losses are experienced at short wavelengths. Secondly, it has previously
been concluded that the limiting factor for achieving large mode areas in endlessly
single-moded PCFs is the macrobending losses [7], however the results shown here
demonstrate that the sensitivity to microbending may be a serious limiting factor too.
The microbending losses may be minimized e.g. by choosing the largest hole sizes
for single-mode operation, a larger outer diameter of the ﬁber, or by improving the
ﬁber production process to avoid frozen-in perturbations, but at present the lower
limit is not well-known. Eventually, when microbending losses have been reduced to
a minimum, it seems feasible to guide single-mode light at 400 nm with a MFD of
10 µm and bending radii down to 80 mm. A similar step-index ﬁber with a cut-oﬀ
at 400 nm, would require a well-controlled index step of the order ∆n = 3 × 10−4,
which requires a very accurate control of the dopant levels in the preform and limited
dopant-diﬀusion during ﬁber pulling. While this is very diﬃcult the same eﬀective
index step can be realized in PCFs with relative ease through control of air hole-sizes.

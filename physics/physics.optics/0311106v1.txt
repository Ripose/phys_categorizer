Abstract. Motivated by recent experimental work by Folkenberg et al. we
consider the eﬀect of weak disorder in the air-hole lattice of small-core photonic
crystal ﬁbers. We ﬁnd that the broken symmetry leads to higher-order modes
which have generic intensity distributions resembling those found in standard
ﬁbers with elliptical cores. This explains why recently reported experimental
higher-order mode proﬁles appear very diﬀerent from those calculated numerically
for ideal photonic crystal ﬁbers with inversion and six-fold rotational symmetry.
The splitting of the four higher-order modes into two groups fully correlates with
the observation that these modes have diﬀerent cut-oﬀs.

The advances in fabrication techniques and structural control of both index-
guiding as well as photonic band-gap photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs) is believed to
improve the agreement between experiments and theory based on ideal structures (for
a recent review of the ﬁeld we refer to Ref. [1] and references therein). The recent
investigation of micro-bending induced attenuation in PCFs [2] is an example of the
successful merging of experiments and simulations as well as recent experiments [3]
on multi-mode cut-oﬀ in small-core PCFs and the good agreement with theoretical
predictions [4, 5]. On the other hand, in the latter experiments the observed higher-
order mode proﬁles were very diﬀerent from those of an ideal structure despite the fact
that the studied ﬁbers appeared to have highly regular air-hole lattices. However, the
relative strength of disorder may still be signiﬁcant and in this Letter we numerically
study the eﬀect of such variations on both ﬁelds and propagation constants.

We consider the type of PCF ﬁrst studied by Knight et al. [6] for which the
ideal structure has inversion and six-fold rotational symmetry, see Fig. 1. In the ﬁrst
row of Fig. 2 we show the electrical ﬁeld intensity |E(0)
m |2 (the superscript emphasizes
the ideal or “unperturbed” structure) of the ﬁrst six (m = 1, 2, 3 . . . 6) eigenmodes
at λ = 780 nm of an ideal PCF with Λ = 1.4 µm and d/Λ = 0.67 corresponding
to one of the ﬁbers studied in Ref. [3]. The results are based on a numerical fully-
vectorial solution of Maxwell’s equations in a plane-wave basis with periodic boundary
conditions [7] and basis vectors which support the inversion and six-fold rotational
symmetry of the dielectric structure. For the refractive index n we use n = 1 in air
and for silica we use a Sellmeier expression with n = 1.45367. The fundamental modes
(m = 1 and 2) have close-to-Gaussian proﬁles [8, 9].

Historically, their degeneracy has been widely debated (see Refs. [10, 11] and
references therein) but recently it was ﬁnally proved by Steel et al. [10] how their
degeneracy follows from group-theory because E(0)
2 do not support the full
1
symmetry. Recently, the degeneracies of higher-order modes were addressed by Guobin
et al. [12], but only in the case of a PCF supporting 10 eigenmodes. The general picture

is quite complicated and the degeneracies and order depend on the number of guided
eigenmodes [13]. In a picture of true eigenmodes this can be understood as follows;
for a given number M of guided eigenmodes the eigenvalues are minimized with the
constraint that the eigenﬁelds are orthonormal. When the number is changed to, say,
M + 1 the orthogonalization aﬀects all M + 1 eigenvalues and eigenﬁelds and thus
the picture of degeneracies may in general also change compared to the picture for M
eigenmodes.

In our case we numerically ﬁnd that while E(0)

a set of modes which are either pair-wise two-fold degenerate (m = 1, 2 and m = 5, 6)
or non-degenerate (m = 3 and m = 4). This contrasts the situation of a step-index
ﬁber (SIF) in the weakly-guiding approximation where the ﬁrst higher-order modes
are four-fold degenerate. The 3rd and 4th modes are nearly degenerate in the sense
that our numerical studies show that the splitting β(0)
is much smaller than
the spacings β(0)
and β(0)
to the two neighboring groups of degenerate
modes. The grouping of the four higher-order modes into two groups is experimentally
reﬂected in diﬀerent cut-oﬀ wavelengths of the two groups [3]. Compared to the picture

in the weakly-guiding approximation, the splitting of the higher-order modes in PCFs
originates from the inversion and six-fold rotational symmetry and the magnitude of
the splitting is driven by the high index contrast between air and silica. We note that
for a standard ﬁbre, a suﬃciently high index contrast will eventually also split the
higher-order modes.

From perturbation theory (for the problem of shifting boundaries see Ref. [14])
it is obvious that for guided modes the six inner air-holes are of most importance
to the optical properties whereas disorder in the air-hole lattice further out in the
cladding mainly aﬀects the guided modes in terms of e.g. leakage loss [15]. Thus, in
the search of over-all qualitative eﬀects of disorder it is suﬃcient to only let the six
inner air-holes (see Fig. 1) have small random displacements ∆ri (i = 1, 2, . . . 6) with
respect to the ideal positions of the air-holes as well as small random deviations ∆di in
their diameters. We consider the situation where the displacements and deviations in
diameter are Gaussianly distributed (zero mean and widths σΛ and σd) and mutually
uncorrelated, i.e.

(cid:10)∆ri(cid:11) = (cid:10)∆di(cid:11) = (cid:10)∆ri∆dj (cid:11) = 0
(cid:10)∆ri∆rj(cid:11) = σ2

numerically.

Since the structural imperfection is typically a small perturbation of the ideal
structure we have (cid:10)βm(cid:11) ≃ β(0)
m . The grouping discussed above thus also holds
approximately for the average propagation constants (cid:10)βm(cid:11) as we also have conﬁrmed
numerically (not shown).
In Fig. 3 we show the distribution of the propagation
constant for the ﬁrst six eigenmodes at λ = 780 nm of a PCF with Λ = 1.4 µm
and d/Λ = 0.67. For the disorder we have used σΛ = σd = 0.02 × Λ corresponding to
2% structural variations of the six inner air holes. The fundamental mode only has
a small fraction of the ﬁeld near to the air-hole silica interfaces compared to higher-
order modes, see row (a) in Fig. 2. From perturbation theory one thus expects the
fundamental mode to be less sensitive to disorder compared to higher-order modes.
Indeed, from Fig. 3 it is seen that the distribution P (βm) has a common width for
m = 1, 2 which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the common width for the higher-order
modes (m = 3, 4, 5, 6).

For a non-zero σ, symmetries are broken and symmetry-related degeneracies
are in principle lifted. For m = 1, 2 this splitting is often referred to as form-
birefringence quantiﬁed by ∆n12 = (β1 −β2)/k where k is the free-space wave number.

no signiﬁcant form-birefringence (∆n12 ≃ 0) to lowest order in perturbation theory.
Indeed, for the studied disorder strength we numerically ﬁnd an extremely narrow
distribution. The width is vanishing (within our numerical accuracy) corresponding
to a delta-function distribution P (β1 − β2) ≃ δ(β1 − β2).

The eﬀect of disorder on the ﬁelds is illustrated in Fig. 2. Rows (b)-(e) show
examples of the electrical ﬁeld intensity for four random conﬁgurations of the inner ring
of air-holes. In general, we ﬁnd that the modes in the ideal structure, row (a), deform
into proﬁles having two maxima with a node in between similarly to the deformation of
the modes in elliptical core SIFs [16]. This picture correlates perfectly with the modes
observed experimentally in Ref. [3]. Fig. 4 shows near-ﬁelds recorded at λ = 780 nm
for a PCF with Λ ≃ 1.41 µm and d/λ ≃ 0.66. Here, the fundamental mode, panel (a),
corresponds to the linear combination E ∼ E1 + E2 and for the higher-order modes,
panels (b) and (c) corresponds to E ∼ E3 + E4 and E ∼ E5 + E6, respectively.

In conclusion we have demonstrated how even weak disorder in the air-hole lattice
leads to deformation of the higher-order modes in small-core photonic crystal ﬁbers.
In the presence of disorder the higher-order modes resemble those in elliptical core
standard ﬁbers. Our ﬁndings explain the recently reported higher-order mode proﬁles
and the grouping of higher-order modes correlates with the observation that they have

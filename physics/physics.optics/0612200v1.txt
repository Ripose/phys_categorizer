We show that ballistic transport of optically excited atoms in an atomic vapor provides a nonlocal
nonlinearity which stabilizes the propagation of vortex beams and higher order modes in the presence
of a self-focusing nonlinearity. Numerical experiments demonstrate stable propagation of lowest and
higher order vortices over a hundred diﬀraction lengths, before dissipation leads to decay of these
structures.

The propagation and dynamics of localized nonlinear
waves is a subject of great interest in a range of physi-
cal settings stretching from nonlinear optics to plasmas
and ultracold atomic gases [1, 2]. The structure and sta-
bility of nonlinear optical modes is determined by the
interplay of the radiation ﬁeld with the functional form
of the material nonlinearity [3].
In the case of opti-
cal beams the nonlinear response can be described in
terms of the induced change in the refractive index n
which is often approximated as a local function of the
wave intensity, i.e. n(r) = n(I(r)). However, in many
real physical systems the nonlinear response is spatially
nonlocal which means that the refractive index depends
on the beam intensity in the neighborhood of each spa-
tial point. This can be phenomenologically expressed as
n(r) =
dr′ K(r, r′)I(r′), where the response kernel K
depends on the particular model of nonlocality [4].

It has been shown that nonlocality drastically aﬀects
the stationary structure and dynamics of spatial solitons,
leading to such eﬀects as collapse arrest of high intensity
beams and stabilization of otherwise unstable complex
solitonic structures [5, 6, 7, 8]. Nonlocality is often the
consequence of transport processes which include atom
or heat diﬀusion in atomic vapors [9], plasma [10] and
thermal media [11], or charge drift in photorefractive
crystals [12]. In addition long range interactions are re-
sponsible for a nonlocal response in liquid crystals [13] or
dipolar Bose Einstein condensates [14].

Hot atomic vapors are an important and widely used
nonlinear medium. The nonlocal nonlinear response of
atomic vapors has previously only been associated with
state dependent transport of ground state atoms which
possess a multilevel structure [9]. In this letter we intro-
duce a new and signiﬁcant mechanism of nonlocality in
atomic vapors which is provided by the ballistic trans-
port of excited atoms and is important even for the sim-
plest case of an idealized two-level atom. We show using
parameters representative of beam propagation in Ru-
bidium vapor that ballistic transport plays a dramatic
role leading to stabilization of otherwise unstable vortex
modes in the presence of a self-focusing nonlinearity.

Prior to introducing a model for the nonlocal character
of the refractive index we ﬁrst recall the main features of
beam propagation in a hot atomic vapor. We consider

eﬀects in an atomic vapor. The physical eﬀect leading to
the nonlinear optical response is the transfer of popula-
tion from the ground to the excited state and the creation
of coherence between these states. Although motional ef-
fects are accounted for as regards the Doppler smearing
of the transition frequency, atomic motion also results
in transport of excited atoms which leads to a nonlocal
response. The degree of nonlocality depends on the char-
acteristic length scales associated with the transport of
excited state atoms. The ﬁrst length scale is the mean

To complete the theoretical formulation of the wave
propagation problem we need to calculate the nonlocal
structure of the susceptibility χnl. The imaginary part
of the nonlinear susceptibility is proportional to the dif-
ferential density of excited and ground state atoms which
decays with rate γ. When the intensity is uniform in
space the susceptibility satisﬁes the relaxation equation

Equations (11, 12) together with the Green function Eq.
(10) and the wave equation (1) are the main theoreti-
cal result of this paper. They constitute a full descrip-
tion of time-independent wave propagation in a two-level
atomic vapor including Doppler broadening and trans-
port induced nonlocality.

The question of whether or not the ballistic transport
is suﬃcient to stabilize nonlinear modes can be investi-
gated by beam propagation calculations. We use param-
eters corresponding to oﬀ-resonant propagation in a high

3, ℓd = 7.5 µm), which result in the dimen-
sionless parameters a = 4, b = 0.0083, and χ0 = 0.03. We
used this set throughout all the simulations presented in
this paper. In the conservative system (χ′′0 = χ′′nl = 0)
all modes we tried (ground state, single charged vortex,
dipole, double charged vortex) turned out to be stable if
I(r)dr, is high enough. At least for the
the power P =
latter two modes this is quite remarkable, since they are
known to be unstable (or only stable in a small power
window) for other nonlocal models [8, 19, 20]. We at-
tribute this enhanced stabilization to the combination of
nonlocality and nonlinear saturation. In fact, we inserted
an artiﬁcial nonlinear saturation in the nonlocal thermal
model used in Ref. [19] and found that the double charged
vortex becomes stable as well. However, it is worth point-
ing out that nonlinear saturation without nonlocality does
not stabilize higher order nonlinear modes [21]. The local
Eqs. (1,2) feature a stable ground state only.

R

Figure 2 illustrates both saturation and nonlocality for
the nonlocal single charged vortex mode. If we consider
only the saturation eﬀect shown in Fig. 2(a) the result-
ing nonlinear index is the dashed blue line in Fig. 2(b).
Together with the nonlocal kernel G [red line in Fig. 1
inset] we get the solid blue line, showing some ﬁlling in
of the central dip in the index proﬁle, and the formation
of a broader “nonlocal waveguide”.

The limiting mechanism with respect to long distance
propagation of higher order nonlocal nonlinear modes is
not destabilization but dissipation. The action of both χ′′0
and χ′′nl is not negligible over one diﬀraction length zd =
2kℓ2
d [22]. As an illustrative example, the propagation
of the nonlocal single charged vortex mode, is shown in
Fig. 3(a). As input power we use about 0.4 W. Note
the clearly visible inﬂuence of the nonlinear term χnl in
the blue power curve. The nonlocal vortex survives a
propagation distance of more than 150zd [see Fig. 3(b)].
For comparison, the propagation of the local vortex with
the same input power is shown in dashed lines in Fig.

a generic nonlocal nonlinearity which can stabilize the
propagation of vortices and other higher order modes in
a self-focusing medium. For suﬃciently high power we
found a stable dipole mode and single and double charged
vortices. In realistic models dissipation is not negligible.
Nevertheless, numerical experiments demonstrate robust
propagation over a hundred or more diﬀraction lengths.
This is possible due to adiabatic conversion into solitons
with lower power, but of the same family.

Numerical simulations were performed on the SGI Al-
tix 3700 Bx2 cluster of the Australian Partnership for Ad-
vanced Computing and on the IBM p690 cluster (JUMP)
of the Forschungs-Zentrum in J¨ulich, Germany.

3(a). This vortex disintegrates after less than 15zd [see
Fig. 3(d)]. Hence, we clearly see that the stabilization is
due to nonlocality. With the same input power of about
0.4 W, we also observed a robust nonlocal dipole [see Fig.
3(e)] and double charged vortex [see Fig. 3(f)].

The key feature enabling robust nonlocal dissipative
propagation over a hundred diﬀraction lengths is the
above mentioned stability for high powers. Starting in
the stable power regime, dissipation makes the nonlin-
ear mode “glide down” the family branch until it reaches
powers in the unstable regime. Figure 3(c) conﬁrms this
property by comparing maximal intensity and FWHM
obtained upon propagation with values found from ex-
act numerical solution of the conservative problem using
the method described in [8]. The solid lines are obtained
upon propagation, which explains the small oscillations
in the curves.

In conclusion, we have shown that ballistic transport
of optically excited atoms in a thermal vapor provides

ity is slowed down by eﬀective decrease of the nonlinear
response. See, for instance, M. S. Bigelow, P. Zerom, and
R. W. Boyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 083902 (2004).
[22] Since typical transverse length scales of the nonlinear

modes under consideration are of the order ℓd, this deﬁ-
nition of the diﬀraction length makes sense.

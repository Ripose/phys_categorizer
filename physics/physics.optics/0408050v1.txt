Abstract

Diﬀraction of electromagnetic plane waves by the gratings made by periodically corrugating

the exposed planar boundaries of homogeneous, isotropic, linear dielectric–magnetic half–spaces is

examined. The phase velocity vector in the diﬀracting material can be either co–parallel or anti–

parallel to the time–averaged Poynting vector, thereby allowing for the material to be classiﬁed as

of either the positive or the negative negative phase–velocity (PPV or NPV) type. Three methods

used for analyzing dielectric gratings — the Rayleigh–hypothesis method, a perturbative approach,

and the C formalism — are extended here to encompass NPV gratings by a careful consideration

of ﬁeld representation inside the refracting half–space. Corrugations of both symmetric as well as

asymmetric shapes are studied, as also the diversity of grating response to the linear polarization

states of the incident plane wave. The replacement of PPV grating by its NPV analog aﬀects only

nonspecular diﬀraction eﬃciencies when the corrugations are shallow, and the eﬀect on specular

diﬀraction eﬃciencies intensiﬁes as the corrugations deepen. Whether the type of the refracting

material is NPV or PPV is shown to aﬀect surface wave propagation as well as resonant excitation

INTRODUCTION

Diﬀraction gratings are not only exploited by nature for the production of color [1] but

have also been extensively used in optics for several centuries [2]. During the last century,

tremendous progress in manufacturing techniques made diﬀraction gratings as the spectral

dispersive elements of choice. Spectacular progress was also made on the numerical solution

of the time–harmonic Maxwell equations for diﬀraction gratings, thereby greatly facilitating

analysis and design [3]. Given such remarkable developments, one would think that the last

word on diﬀraction gratings is imminent; but the emergence of isotropic dielectric–magnetic

materials exhibiting phase velocity vector opposed in direction to the time–averaged Poynting

vector [4]-[6] has opened new prospects for diﬀraction gratings.

Typically, a diﬀraction grating is a slab of either a metal or a dielectric material whose

exposed surface is periodically corrugated. When a plane wave is incident on this surface,

it is reﬂected partially in the specular direction ﬁxed by Snel’s law [7] and partially in

nonspecular directions ﬁxed by the periodicity of the corrugated surface in relation to the

free–space wavelength. In addition, specular as well as nonspecular refraction into the slab

may also occur, depending on the type of material. Finally, reﬂections from the back surface

also contribute to the overall reﬂection from the grating, but those need not be considered

when examining the essence of the phenomenon of diﬀraction. As the angle of incidence is

changed, specular as well as nonspecular components of the reﬂected ﬁeld wax and wane,

which phenomenon is technologically exploitable.

What would happen if a diﬀraction grating were to be made of an isotropic dielectric–

magnetic material? If the phase velocity and the time–averaged Poynting vectors in this

material are co–parallel, then the eﬀects are not qualitatively diﬀerent from a diﬀraction

grating made of simply an isotropic dielectric material [8], while the quantitative diﬀerences

are due to diﬀerences in the relative impedance and the wavenumber inside the diﬀracting

material [9]. This paper is devoted to the case when the phase velocity and the time–

averaged Poynting vectors in the diﬀracting material are oppositely directed. Though several

names have been proposed for this class of materials, we think that the most descriptive is:

2

negative phase–velocity (NPV) materials.

In contrast, the phase velocity and the time–

averaged Poynting vectors are co–parallel in positive phase–velocity (PPV) materials. PPV

materials are, of course, commonplace.

The plan of this paper is as follows: The boundary value problem of a diﬀraction grating

is presented in Section II, with careful delineation of ﬁeld characteristics in the refracting

half–space. Three methods of solving the boundary value problem are extended in Section

III to encompass NPV refracting materials. These methods are: (i) the Rayleigh–hypothesis

method, (ii) perturbative approach, and (iii) the C formalism. Numerical results for corru-

gations of both symmetric as well as asymmetric shapes are presented in Section IV, and

the eﬀects of replacing a PPV material by its NPV analog, or vice versa, are extracted from

those results. An exp(

iωt) time–dependence is implicit, with i = √

1, ω as the angular

−

frequency, and t as the time.

II. BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM

In a rectangular coordinate system (x, y, z), we consider the periodically corrugated bound-

ary y = g(x) = g(x + d) between vacuum and a homogeneous, isotropic, linear, passive,

dielectric–magnetic material, with d being the corrugation period. The region y > g(x) is

vacuous, whereas the material occupying the region y < g(x) is characterized by complex–

valued scalars ǫ2 = ǫ2R + iǫ2I and µ2 = µ2R + iµ2I that depend on ω. If this medium is of

the NPV type, then the following three conditions hold equivalently [10, 11]:

None of the three conditions hold for a PPV material.

(1)

A linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave is incident on this boundary from the

region y > g(x) at an angle θ0, (

< π/2), with respect to the y axis, as shown in Figure 1.

This plane wave can be either s–polarized or p–polarized [12]. Given the orientation of the

3

plane wave with respect to the grating plane (i.e., the xy plane), all reﬂected and transmitted

ﬁelds must be linearly polarized in the same way as the incident plane wave [13].

Let the function f (x, y) represent the z–directed component of the total electric ﬁeld for

the s–polarization case, and the z–directed component of the total magnetic ﬁeld for the p–

polarization case. After starting from the time–harmonic Maxwell equations, this function

III. METHODS OF SOLUTION

Analytical solution of the stated boundary value problem is well nigh impossible, except

in a perturbative sense. Early numerical techniques [16] relied on the so–called Rayleigh

hypothesis, according to which the expansions (3) can be assumed valid at y = g(x)

[17].

±

Therefore, those techniques were not applicable for deeply corrugated boundaries [13]. The

limitations of the Rayleigh hypothesis were overcome by the T–matrix method [8, 18] and

the C formalism [19, 20], of which the latter displays superior performance. All of these

techniques require various degrees of computational proﬁciency, and so we applied three

diﬀerent methods of solution for NPV diﬀraction gratings — as checks on each other, as

applicable.

(a) Rayleigh–hypothesis method

This method was enunciated by Rayleigh [17] for gratings made by sinusoidally corrugating a

perfectly reﬂecting sheet. According to his hypothesis, the expansions (3) have to be used in

the boundary conditions (7). Both resulting equations are then projected into the Rayleigh

The summation on the left side of (8) has to be appropriately truncated, and the equations

are then put in the form of a matrix equation which can be solved by standard numerical

methods [23].

The Rayleigh hypothesis is valid when the corrugations are not deep, and the limit of its

applicability for sinusoidal gratings has been rigorously established. Millar [24] showed that

the Rayleigh hypothesis is applicable for perfectly reﬂecting gratings of sinusoidal shape with

maximum slope not exceeding 0.448. This limit was validated by Hill & Celli [25], who also

noted that the methods exploiting the Rayleigh hypothesis could yield acceptable results for

steeper gratings. Depine & Gigli [26] carried out detailed numerical studies to show that

the Rayleigh hypothesis can be considered adequate for dielectric sinusoidal gratings with

maximum slopes as high as

0.92.

(b) Perturbative approach

A perturbative approach applies well when the corrugations are very shallow. The integrals

eigenvalue of the 2

2 block supermatrix on the left side of (23); and the eigenvalue spectrum

×

of this supermatrix has to be determined for the regions above (p = 1) and below (p = 2)

the corrugated surface v = 0.

For numerical solution, the inﬁnite system in (23) must be truncated. If only N terms are

kept in each Fourier series, each block in the 2

2 block supermatrix is a N

×
resulting in 2N eigenvalues for each value of p. In each region, all eigenvalues not satisfying

×

N matrix, thus

the radiation condition at inﬁnity should be discarded in the representation of the diﬀracted

ﬁeld. Accordingly, for p = 1, only those eigenvalues are acceptable for which either ρ is

real–valued and positive or ρ is complex–valued with positive imaginary part [20, 28, 29].

Similarly, for p = 2, when the region v < 0 is ﬁlled with a PPV material, acceptable values of

ρ must be either real–valued and negative or complex–valued with negative imaginary part.

However, when the region v < 0 is ﬁlled with a NPV material, acceptable values of ρ must

be either real–valued and positive or complex–valued with negative imaginary part. Actual

diﬀracting materials must be dissipative; hence, whether the region v < 0 is occupied by a

PPV or a NPV material, the criterion

Im [ρ] < 0

(24)

suﬃces for p = 2. This criterion for the eigenvalues, together with the criterion (6) for
selecting β(2)

n , are the central modiﬁcations that we have incorporated in the conventional

C formalism for making it applicable to diﬀraction by either PPV or NPV corrugated half–

spaces.

For PPV materials, Chandezon et al. [29] have shown numerically and Li [30] has shown

analytically that the real–valued eigenvalues and the lower–order complex–valued eigenvalues

of (23) converge to

β(2)
n as N increases. This property must also hold for NPV materials,

±

since, as noted by Li [20], a plane wave is an eigensolution of (2) and the transformation (19)

does not change the relevant eigenvalue, whether the refracting material is of the PPV or the

NPV type. Indeed, (23) indicates that when the signs of both ǫ2R and µ2R are changed, the

eigenvalues in the refracting half–space transform into their own complex conjugates. This

is demonstrated by the sample results presented in Table 1.

proceeds as usual. As this is well–documented in the literature [19, 20, 29], we only sketch

the procedure here for completeness. The following two steps are undertaken:

mq are the successive elements of the top

to physically acceptable propagating plane waves, and we note that the set U(2) is

always an empty set when the refracting material is dissipative. In contrast, the set
V(p) contains indexes corresponding to physically acceptable evanescent plane waves.

(ii) Second, (26) and (27) are rewritten in terms of the variables x and v only and then

introduced in the boundary conditions (7). A complete set of linear algebraic equations
is thereby obtained for the sets of the unknown scalars c(p)

. The 2N scalars

n and C (p)

are then calculated using standard methods [23].

The C formalism, not invoking the Rayleigh hypothesis and therefore not limited to grat-

ings with shallow corrugations, is a very eﬃcient and versatile theoretical tool for modeling

the electromagnetic responses of diﬀraction gratings of arbitrary permittivity and corrugation

shape. As stated in Ref. [28], the most distinctive feature of this formalism is its virtually

uniform convergence, regardless of the incident polarization state and the permittivity of the

12

refracting material. Originally set up for uncoated, perfectly conducting gratings in classical

mounts [19], the essence of the formalism — mainly, the simplicity of the coordinate system

(19) — has allowed its extension to many other situations. Examples include multilayer–

coated dielectric and metallic gratings [29], conical mountings [31], nonlinear materials [32],

anisotropic materials [33, 34, 35] nonhomogeneous materials [36], and crossed gratings [37].

This versatility of the C formalism is not matched by any other rigorous method for gratings

[3]. We found that the characteristic features of this formalism are valid even for diﬀraction

gratings of isotropic NPV materials.

boundary into the refracting half–space y < g(x) can be calculated by virtue of the Poynting

theorem, if the ﬁelds at the surface y = g(x)

are known. The principle of conservation of

energy requires that

with Pa being completely absorbed by the refracting material. When we implemented any

of the methods of solution presented in Sections III(a)–(c), we checked that the condition

(29) was satisﬁed to an error of 10 ppm.

IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

most most widely used shape:

Calculations of the diﬀraction eﬃciencies were made for many values of the geometric ratio

h/d and normalized periodicity ωd/c, using one or all three of the methods of solution

described in Section III, as applicable. These results are presented and discussed in Sections

IV(a)–(c). Asymmetric counterparts

of the symmetric gratings (30) are addressed in Section IV(d).

Let us begin with gratings described by (30). When the boundary y = g(x) is perfectly ﬂat,
the only non–zero reﬂection coeﬃcient is c(1)

0 . The transformation

does not aﬀect er

0 but not its magnitude [10]; hence, the transformation

0 at all.

For a shallow grating, we therefore expect that the magnitude of the specular reﬂection

coeﬃcient would not be greatly aﬀected by the transformation (32), but the eﬀect of the

transformation should be unambiguously evidenced by the nonspecular diﬀracted orders.

This is indeed true, as was borne out by results computed using the perturbative approach

of Section III(b).

The diversity can be understood as follows: When the boundary is perfectly ﬂat, the

transformation (32) leaves the magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient unchanged only for non–

evanescent incident plane waves; but that is not a true statement for incident evanescent

plane waves [38]. In the troughs of a shallow grating, i.e., for max g(x) > y > g(x), the

total ﬁeld actually has both specular (n = 0) and nonspecular (n

= 0) components, by

virtue of the Rayleigh hypothesis. The nonspecular components are like evanescent plane

waves because they are characterized by Re

As the corrugations grow deeper (i.e., as h/d increases in value), the transformation of the

(c) Resonant surface–wave excitation

A mechanism that can introduce dramatic changes in the diﬀraction eﬃciencies when the

type of the refracting material is transformed from NPV/PPV to PPV/NPV is the resonant

excitation of surface waves. Surface waves are not allowed to propagate on a plane boundary

between vacuum and a material whose permittivity and permeability have positive real parts

(Boardman 1982). For p–polarized (resp. s–polarized) surface waves to propagate along that

boundary, the real part of the permittivity (resp. permeability) of the refracting material

must be negative. Dielectric materials with negative real permittivity are exempliﬁed by

plasmas as well as metals (Boardman 1982). With the emergence of NPV materials, the

propagation of both types of surface waves on the same plane boundary has become possible

[39, 40], although in principle for diﬀerent frequencies.

If the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the surface wave on each side of a plane boundary are

described by (3) without the term corresponding to the incident plane wave and with only

the n = 0 terms in the two series, dispersion relations can be easily obtained [39, 40]. Thus,

the wavenumber α0 of the surface wave satisﬁes the relation

for s polarization, and

for p polarization. These relations apply rigorously to plane boundaries only.

To illustrate how the surface wave mechanism can aﬀect the diﬀraction eﬃciencies of

a grating when the type of the refracting material is transformed from NPV/PPV to

PPV/NPV, even for shallow corrugations, we performed calculations with ǫ2 =

1.8 + i0.01

−

and µ2 = 1.5 + i0.01. According to the conditions (1), this material is of the NPV type.

We see, from (34), that a plane boundary can support a p–polarized surface wave with

c α0/ω

≈

1.63 + i0.01. If the transformation (32) is implemented, the plane boundary can

not support the propagation of a p–polarized surface wave; instead, as follows from (33), an

s–polarized surface wave can then propagate with c α0/ω

1.99 + i0.02. As the real parts of

≈

17

both values of c α0/ω are greater than unity, neither of the two types of surfaces waves can

be resonantly excited by illuminating the plane boundary by a plane wave from the vacuum

side.

However, as is well–established in the grating literature [41, 42], surface waves can be

coupled to propagating waves through the periodicity of a corrugated boundary.

If the

period of the grating is convenently chosen, the surface wave can be coupled with one of

the nonspecular components (i.e., n

= 0). For example, after choosing ωd/c = 2π/1.51

and assuming that the wavenumber of the surface wave is not appreciably altered by the
7◦, when the refracting material is of the
corrugation, (4) for αn predicts a coupling at θ0 ≈
NPV type (ǫ2 =

1.8 + i0.01, µ2 = 1.5 + i0.01). This is conﬁrmed by the numerical results

−

shown in Figure 4 for h/d = 0.07. The zeroth–order eﬃciency curve as a function of angle of

incidence (Figure 4a) for s–polarization is almost ﬂat, whereas for p–polarization it exhibits

a pronounced dip, near an angle of incidence very close to that predicted by the quasiplane
7.9◦, is not related to a
approximation (34) for surface–wave excitation. This dip, at θ0 ≈
redistribution of the incident power between other reﬂected orders (i.e., a Rayleigh–Wood

anomaly). Instead, this dip is associated with a peak in the power absorbed in the refracting

material, as can be seen from the Pa–θ0 curve in Figure 4b. At the dip, nearly 87% of the

p–polarized incident power is absorbed by the refracting material, whereas just less than 2%

of incident power is absorbed at all angles of incidence for the other polarization case.

That the transformation of the type of the refracting material from NPV to PPV radically

alters the conditions for surface–wave excitation is evident on comparing Figures 4 (ǫ2 =

1.8+i0.01, µ2 =

1.5+i0.01) and 5 (ǫ2 =

1.8+i0.01, µ2 = 1.5+i0.01). Three diﬀerences are

−

−

noticeable. First, the polarization–dependences are diﬀerent: whereas the the NPV grating

exhibits a strong absorption peak for p– but not for s–polarization, its PPV analog exhibits

a strong absorption peak for s– but not for p–polarization. Second, the absorption peaks

occur at diﬀerent angles of incidence for the two types of materials. The peak absorption
30.9◦ in
in Figure 4 occurs for p–polarization at θ0 ≈
Figure 5b. Third, although both peak absorptions are very strong, that in Figure 5, near
θ0 ≈

30.9◦, is almost total (nearly 99% of the s–polarized incident power).

For gratings with deep corrugations, the wavenumber of the surface wave can be apprecia-

bly diﬀerent from the values in the absence of the corrugations, or the surface wave can even

be forbidden to propagate. This can be concluded from Figures 6 and Figures 7, which were

drawn for the same parameters as for Figures 4 and Figures 5, except that now h/d = 1.

Apparently, the p–polarized surface wave does still play a role in the diﬀraction by the NPV
10.5◦, close to the value found for
grating (Figure 6c), with a broad absorption peak at θ0 ≈

19

h/d = 0.07 in Figure 4b. But no resonant behavior can be seen in Figure 7, the refracting
material then being of the PPV type. The Rayleigh–Wood anomaly determined by β(1)
is indicated in both ﬁgures at θ0 ≈

plots were made for both the s– and the p–polarization cases, using the C formalism with

Additionally, as in Sections IV (a) and (b), the diﬀerences between NPV and PPV gratings

are easy to divine from Figure 8, and Rayleigh–Wood anomalies are present therein.

The corrugation shape should aﬀect surface wave propagation. This conjecture was veriﬁed

when the calcuations for Figures 4 (ǫ2 =

1.8 + i0.01, µ2 = 1.5 + i0.01) and 5 (ǫ2 = 1.8 +

by (33) and (34). But the introduction of a Fourier harmonic to a sinusoidal corrugation

seems to change strongly the coupling between the surface and incident waves, both for NPV

and for PPV materials, as can be observed from Figures 9 and 10.

Finally, we must remark on a major diﬀerence and a major similarity between Figures

2–7 on the one hand and Figures 8–10 on the other. The corrugation shape is symmetric

for the former set of ﬁgures, but asymmetric for the latter. We see that Pa(θ0) = Pa(

and the C formalism to encompass diﬀraction by surface–relief gratings made of made of

−

isotropic, negative phase–velocity materials. This was enabled by carefully representing the

ﬁeld inside the refracting material. Numerical results for corrugations of both symmetric

as well as asymmetric shapes were obtained, as also for both s– and p–polarized incident

plane waves. We concluded that replacement of a PPV grating by its NPV analog aﬀects only

nonspecular diﬀraction eﬃciencies when the corrugations are shallow. When the corrugations

deepen, the specular diﬀraction eﬃciencies are also aﬀected by the type of the refracting

material.

Surface wave propagation as well as the resonant excitation of surface waves also depends

on whether the refracting material is of the NPV type or its PPV analog. Excitation of a

surface wave through a grating plays a fundamental role when high selectivity is desired. In

common PPV gratings, surface waves have been exploited for eﬃcient conversion of p– to

24

s– polarizations, or vice versa in conical mountings as well as to obtain enhanced nonlinear

optical eﬀects through the enhancement of surface ﬁelds usually associated with the resonant

excitation of surface polaritons [41, 42]. Surface waves play an important role in the concept

of a perfect lens realized using a NPV material, since the ﬁeld of an image, which can not

be focused by a normal lens, can be transferred through a NPV layer by the excitation of

surface waves at both of its boundaries [6, 40]. We expect that NPV slabs with periodically

corrugated boundaries combine both attributes.

On Sommerfeld precursor in a Lorentz medium

Abstract

A one-dimensional electromagnetic problem of Sommerfeld pre-
cursor evolution, resulting from a ﬁnite rise-time signal excitation in
a dispersive Lorentz medium is considered. The eﬀect of the initial
signal rate of growth as well as of the medium dumping on the pre-
cursor shape and its magnitude is discussed. The analysis applied
is based on an approach employing uniform asymptotic expansions.
In addition, new approximate formulas are given for the location of
the distant saddle points which aﬀect local frequency and dumping of
the precursor. The results obtained are illustrated numerically and
compared with the results known from the literature.

1 Introduction

Fundamental investigations on EM signal propagation in the Lorentz model
of a dispersive medium are due to Sommerfeld [1] and Brillouin [2, 3]. These
authors revealed that in addition to the main signal propagating in the
medium, two precursors are formed which precede the signal. The front of the
fastest (Sommerfeld) precursor propagates in the medium with the velocity
of light. The instantaneous oscillation frequencies of the precursors and their
local dumping are directly related to the locations in the complex frequency
plane of the corresponding saddle points in the integral representation of the
signal. Those locations vary with space and time, and are governed by the
saddle point equation (SPE) in Eq. (9), requiring that the phase function in
the integrand in that representation be stationary. Analysis of the equation
shows that there are two pairs of dominant saddle points, the distant and
the near ones, responsible for the ﬁrst (referred to as Sommerfeld) and the
second (Brillouin) precursors, respectively. The saddle points in each pair
are located symmetrically with respect to the frequency imaginary axis, the
fact being related to the causality principle.

1

Since SPE seems to be not solvable in a closed form, attempts have been
made to solve it in an approximate manner. Brillouin’s approach [3] con-
sisted in replacing the complex index of refraction in SPE by its expansion in
powers of frequency, and then solving the simpliﬁed equation for frequency.
As a result, a simple, approximate formula was found relating complex fre-
quency to the distance and time coordinates. In the case of the Sommerfeld
precursor, the applicability of this map was conﬁned to the vicinity of the
front of the precursor. Unfortunately, Brillouin, having at his disposal only
a non-uniform asymptotic method, could not eﬀectively describe the front
evolution, as it corresponds to coalescence of two distant saddle points at
inﬁnity, the case not treatable with the method he used. This deﬁciency was
removed by Bleistein and Handelsman [4] who developed a uniform asymp-
totic approach that extended the validity of asymptotic considerations to the
precursor front.

Recently, the problem of asymptotic analysis of signal propagation in
dispersive media has been reexamined by many authors. Extensive research
in this ﬁeld is due to Oughstun and Sherman [5] and Kelbert and Sazonov
[6]. In a recent work, [7] Dvorak, Ziolkowski and Felsen oﬀered a new hybrid
approach combining both the asymptotic and FFT methods, the former being
responsible for extreme parts of the signal frequency spectrum.

In this work we reconsider the asymptotic model of signal propagation
in a Lorentz medium, and concentrate on the Sommerfeld precursor. We
assume that the Sommerfeld precursor is excited in the Lorentz medium by
a sine modulated signal, with its envelope described by a hyperbolic tangent
function. Such a representation provides a convenient model for signals with
ﬁnite rise time. Unlike the Oughstun-Sherman study (([5], Secs. 4.3.4, 7.2.7
and 7.3.7), where the signal envelope was described by an everywhere non-
zero smooth function, our initial signal has the form of an abruptly switched
modulated sine signal, i.e. it vanishes identically for t < 0 and its envelope
is non-zero for t > 0. At t = 0 the derivative of the envelope suﬀers a step
discontinuity. We study the inﬂuence of both the medium and the initial
signal characteristics, including medium damping δ and signal speed factor
β, on the evolution of the Sommerfeld precursor in the medium. In particular,
we analyze how the speed factor aﬀects the shape and the magnitude of the
precursor excited by both the slow and the fast growing incident signals. We
also obtain a simple approximation for the precursor damping factor. Finally,
we provide a new approximation to the location of the saddle points, which
is more accurate that those known in the literature.

The results obtained here may appear to be useful e.g. in designs employ-
ing fast Sommerfeld precursors as signals triggering the electronic devices
designed to process the main signal.

where b2 = 4πNe2/m is the plasma frequency of the medium, N, e and m

respectively, δ is a damping constant and ø0 is the resonant frequency.

In the plane z = 0 of the Cartesian coordinate system

, the ﬁeld
component Ex(0, t), henceforth denoted by E0(t), is assumed to be given.
It is described by a function, which has the form of a ﬁnite rise-time, sine

The large positive coeﬃcient β determines how rapidly the signal turns on,
and øc is a ﬁxed carrier frequency. It is also assumed that no EM sources are
present at z
. In [5] a diﬀerent signal was considered, also employing
a tangent hyperbolic function, which, unlike (2), did not vanish for times
t < 0.

In general, the problem consists in ﬁnding the ﬁeld in the half-space
z > 0 and for time t > 0. The solution to this mixed, initial-boundary value
problem for the Maxwell equations takes the form [8]

. At the precursor onset, i.e. as θ

In this work we conﬁne our interest to one component of the general solu-
tion – the Sommerfeld precursor. A suitable approach to extract this partial
ﬁeld and study its dynamics is to evaluate the integral (3) asymptotically as
1+, the distant saddle points in
z
the complex ø plane meet at inﬁnity to form a saddle point of inﬁnite order.
The valid asymptotic procedure that handles this case is a special instance
of application of the general asymptotic theory developed by Bleistein and
Handelsman and designed to uniformly evaluate integrals with nearby crit-
ical points [10]. (It can also be used in case of more than two coalescing
critical points. The case of three critical points: a pole, a branch point and
a saddle point was studied in [11].)

→

Dynamics of the saddle points, essential in asymptotic considerations, is

governed by the saddle point equation (SPE)

n(ø) + øn′(ø)

θ = 0.

−

(9)

This equation results from the requirement that the phase (5) should be
stationary. It has the form θ = f (ø). What we need is the inverse function
ø = f −1(θ). Approximate solutions to the latter equation were obtained by
Brillouin ([3]), Kelbert and Sazonov ([6]) and Oughstun and Sherman ([5]).
In Sec. 4 we present another approximate solution, which is more accurate
than the solutions known in the literature.

3 Uniform asymptotic representation for the

Sommerfeld precursor

The phase function Ψ(ø, θ) has the saddle point of inﬁnite order at inﬁnity
(see [10], Ch. 9). In this case the classical asymptotic methods break down,

4

→

which implies that they cannot be used to describe the precursor behavior at
1+). Fortunately, the uniform approach, as proposed in
its front (i.e. for θ
[10], can be eﬀectively used. The term ”uniform” means that the resulting
asymptotic expansion is valid for any locations of the far saddle points in
the ø complex plane, including the case where the points (symmetrical with
respect to the imaginary axis) coalesce at inﬁnity to create one saddle point
of inﬁnite order. As a consequence, the expansion holds for any θ
1, in
particular at the precursor front. By using the methods described in [10],
Sec. 9.5, we arrive at the following uniform asymptotic representation1 for
the Sommerfeld precursor as z

A fundamental question that now arises is how the speed parameter β
in (2) and the damping parameter δ aﬀect the precursor dynamics in the
medium. Below we try to answer this question.

If now β is increased, by one order or two, it is can be shown from (10) that
the oscillations in Fig. 1 are increased by the same factor, while the shape of
the precursor is preserved. If, however, β takes much higher values, such as
1019s−1 or more, the precursor shape distinctly changes (see Fig. 2),
β = 1.0
and the oscillation amplitudes virtually remain at the same, relatively high
level as β further increases.

×

This interesting behavior can be explained by studying properties of the
function G(ø+; β, øc). The plot of G(ø+; β, øc) as a function of β with ﬁxed
remaining arguments is presented in Fig. 3.

The value 1.0001 of the variable θ was chosen what corresponds to the
close vicinity of the precursor front (cf. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). It is seen from the
plot that there are three characteristic regions of G(ø+; β, øc) variation. If
for ﬁxed ø+ the parameter β is relatively small then the real part of function
G(ø+; β, øc) is virtually zero and the essential contribution to the precursor is
due to its imaginary part. This contribution increases in value with rising β
1017s−1. This is the ﬁrst region in which the precursor
until about β = 4.0
oscillation is described by the Bessel function J2. In the second, transitory
1019s−1
region, the real part of G grows rapidly, and at about β = 2.0
it settles down at a virtually constant level. The imaginary part reaches
its maximum and then steadily decreases to zero. Here the contribution of
the Bessel function J1 takes over. Finally, in the third region the real part
of G remains nearly unchanged and the imaginary part vanishes. Now the
contribution of J1 dominates and that of J2 is to be neglected. One can verify

3.1.2 A comment on the form of asymptotic representation of the

The form of the asymptotic representation of the Sommerfeld precursor de-
0+. First we note that, ([15], Eqs.

If the RHS of (30) is used in the basic integral formula describing the signal
evolution in a dispersive medium, it appears ([15], Eqs. (7.144)) that in the
1+, the Sommerfeld precursor dynamics is
vicinity of the front, i.e. for θ
described by Jr[b
, one has r = 1 (which follows from
→ ∞
expanding the sine function alone), and the precursor dynamics is described
in terms of J1. If β is ﬁnite, r = 2 (see below (28)), and now J2 describes
the precursor development. The orders of the Bessel functions appearing in
the uniform asymptotic representation of the precursor are determined from
a similar criterion, relating these orders to the behavior of the integrand at
inﬁnity. In our case the smallest value of r is 1, which implies the presence
of the functions J1 and J2 in the asymptotic formula (10).

With increasing θ, the real value of ø+ in the arguments of beta func-
tions in (4) decreases. This results in moving the boundaries between the
three characteristic regions of G(ø+; β, øc) variation with β in the direction
of smaller values of β. As a consequence, J1 describes the precursor behav-
ior not only at β
, but also at ﬁnite, suﬃciently large values of this
parameter (see Fig. 3).

For θ not too large, the square root at the RHS in this equation, and conse-
quently the second term at its LHS, as well as the square roots in (31), can
be approximated by 1. It follows then that the ﬁrst term in (32), appearing
also as a factor in the second term of (31), equals approximately θ

It follows that major cause of the precursor decay is its exponential damp-
ing. For low and moderate θ, the exponent determining the rate of decay is
1). The contribution to precursor decrease
approximately equal to
due to natural lowering of the oscillation amplitudes in the Bessel functions
is of smaller importance.

4 The location of the saddle point ø+(θ)

As seen from (10), evolution of the precursor depends on the function ø+(θ)
which is a solution to SPE, describing the location of the distant saddle point
of (5) in the right complex ø half-plane. Since this function does not seem
to be expressible in a closed form, approximate formulas for it were found
in the literature (Brillouin [3], Oughstun and Sherman [5], and Kelbert and
Sazonov [6]). In this section we oﬀer another approximate solution to (9),
which is more accurate than the previous ones.

14

We begin with approximate solution to SPE found in [16] which provides
good accuracy for large and medium θ, but fails for θ close to 1. First let us
notice that ø+(θ) can be written down in the form

By substituting ζ for ζ1 in (34), a new approximation of the distant saddle
points location is obtained which is valid for θ close to unity. We denote it
by ø+(θ, ζ1).

The two approximations, ø+(θ, ζ1) and ø+(θ, ζ2), can now be combined
into one formula that provides smooth transition from one approximation to
the other. For Brillouin’s choice of the medium parameters we choose the
transition value of θ to be 1.3. Then the joint approximation can be written
down as

Since κ(θ
1.3) is zero outside the interval 1.25 < θ < 1.35, the approxi-
mation øSD(θ) equals ø+(θ, ζ1) if θ < 1.25, and ø+(θ, ζ2) if θ > 1.35. The
factors in square brackets in (47) provide smooth transition between the two
approximations inside the interval. At θ = 1.3, they are understood in a
sense of limits (from the left or from the right), and thus are equal to 1/2. A
diﬀerent choice of media parameters may require the numerical parameters
in (47) and (48) to be modiﬁed.

described by ø+(θ, ξ1) and ø+(θ, ξ2), respectively.

The approximation (47) is shown in Fig.8, together with the approxima-
tions obtained by Brillouin, Kelbert and Sazonov, Oughstun and Sherman,

17

and with the partial approximations ø+(θ; ζ1) and ø+(θ; ζ2). This approxi-
mation is not as simple as the ﬁrst three ones, but may prove to be useful
when a higher accuracy is required. Its maximal deviation from the solution
of (9) found numerically slightly exceeds 2 percent.

Note that the approximation ø+(θ; ζ2) indicates an interesting symmetry
between locations of the distant and near saddle points (see [16]). Similar
symmetry also follows from the Kelbert-Sazonov approximation.

Use of Dynamical Undulator Mechanism to Produce Short

Wavelength Radiation in Volume FEL (VFEL)

VFEL lasing in system with dynamical undulator is described. In this system radi-

ation with longer wavelength creates the undulator for lasing on shorter wavelength.

Two diﬀraction gratings with diﬀerent spatial periods form VFEL resonator. The

grating with longer period pumps the resonator by radiation of longer wavelength

to provide necessary amplitude of undulator ﬁeld. The grating with shorter period

makes mode selection for radiation of shorter wavelength. Lasing of such a system

in terahertz frequency range is discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The development of powerful electromagnetic generators with frequency tuning in mil-

limeter, sub-millimeter and terahertz ranges using low-relativistic and non-relativistic elec-

tron beams is quite perspective for numerous applications. In such devices as TWT, BWT

and orotrons generation of radiation with a wavelength λ requires application of diﬀraction

structures with period

λβγ2. Only electrons passing near the slowing structure at the

distance

interact with electromagnetic wave eﬀectively. In (1) β = u/c, γ is the Lorentz factor of

electron. From (1) it follows, that generation of short-wave radiation for non-relativistic and

low-relativistic electrons requires application of extremely thin and dense electron beams.

Gyrotrons and undulator systems, in which an electron beam interacts with an electro-

magnetic wave in the whole area occupied by magnetic ﬁeld, has no such drawback. Gy-

rotrons and cyclotron resonance facilities are used as radiation sources in millimeter and

sub-millimeter range, but their operation requires magnetic ﬁeld of about several tens of

kiloGauss (ω

eH
mc γ). Applying undulator systems for generation of short-wave radiation
gives rise a problem of manufacture of undulators with small period. For example, generation

∼

of radiation with the wavelength 1 mm at the beam energy E = 800 KeV - 1 MeV requires

to use undulator with period 1 cm. This is extremely complicated problem. Much more

rigid requirements arise in terahertz range. So even for generation in longwave boundary of

terahertz range the undulator period should be

3 mm (for E = 800 KeV). Nowadays such

∼

requirement looks quite fantastic. For radiation in millimeter and sub-millimeter range it is

possible to use mechanism of Compton scattering of an electromagnetic wave by an electron

beam. Usually it is considered, that pumping wave emerges from outside. But, radiation

generated in a system also can play the role of a pumping wave. If Q-factor of resonator is

high enough, then the radiation power is accumulated in resonator and can act as undulator

[1].

Such two-stage system (dynamic wiggler) can be used to soluve several problems simul-

taneously: 1) it allows to obtain radiation of shorter wavelength ( λ

λw/(4γ2), where

∼

λw is the wavelength of a pumping wave. For example, if electron beam has the energy

E

800 KeV

1 MeV the frequency increasef in

30 times;

∼
2) provides volume character of interaction of an electron beam with an electromagnetic

÷

∼

wave for non-relativistic beam (lorentz factor γ

1 (u/c

1)), for which dynamic wiggler

can not allow considerable increase of radiation frequency.

∼

≪

For generation mechanisms based on slowing of electromagnetic wave (Cherenkov, Smith-

Purcell, TWT, quasi-Cherenkov) electron beam interacts with evanescent component of elec-

tromagnetic wave (as it was noted above), therefore, only electrons, passing at the distances

(1) over slowing structures, can radiate. Then, at the ﬁrst stage, the fraction of electron

beam

δ0/∆ participates in creating of dynamic wiggler. All electrons interact with the

∼

signal wave on the second stage.

Use of volume FEL principles extends advantages of the two-stage generation scheme and,

in particular, allows to tune smoothly the period of dynamic wiggler by diﬀraction grating

rotation. There is possibility of smooth tuning of frequency of both the pump wave and the

signal wave by smooth variation of geometrical parameters of volume diﬀraction gratings,

or by its rotation. Moreover, use of VFEL allows to create dynamic wiggler in large volume,

that represents a great problem for static wiggler.

This scheme can be realized by the use of resonator formed by several diﬀraction gratings

with diﬀerent spatial periods [2]. Smooth variation of geometrical parameters of volume

diﬀraction gratings provides smooth variation of frequency of pumping and signal waves.

Two possible realizations of dynamic wiggler on the basis of VFEL are represented on

Figure 1. Dynamic wiggler with undulator mechanism of the ﬁrst stage is depicted in
the upper part of that ﬁgure. In this case the the pumping wave with the vector ~kw and

2γ2 2πβ
du

∼

frequency ωw

is formed by undulator with period du. The wave with frequency

4γ2ωw is generated by the created dynamic wiggler during second stage. The distributed

ω

∼

feedback is provided by two diﬀraction grating with diﬀerent periods (one diﬀraction grating
provides distributed feedback for pumping wave ~kw and another for signal one ~k). The

dynamic wiggler generated by volume grating formed by threads is shown in the lower part of

Figure 1. The generation in VFEL evolves in large volume with dimensions much exceeding

wavelength of radiation that increases electrical endurance of resonator (due to distribution

of electromagnetic power and electron beam over large volume). This peculiarity of VFEL is

4

extremely essential for generation of powerful and super-powerful pulses of electromagnetic

radiation. The mode discrimination in such oversized system is carried out by the multiwave

dynamic diﬀraction [3].

II. DERIVING OF THE BASIC EXPRESSIONS FOR ELECTRON BEAM

INSTABILITY IN A PUMPING WAVE IN CONDITIONS OF MULTIWAVE

DIFFRACTION.

There are two stages in the generation scheme proposed above: a)generation of dynamic

wiggler in a system with two-dimensional (three-dimensional) grating ; b) generation of ra-

diation by an electron beam interacting with dynamic wiggler appeared on stage a). Let’s

consider stage a). The diﬀraction grating providing non one-dimensional distributed feed-

back is used to evolve dynamic wiggler. Smooth variation of diﬀraction geometry of this

diﬀraction grating yields smooth variation of dynamic wiggler parameters. The electromag-

netic ﬁeld of wiggler rises with time τw

Q(ωw)/ωw, where ωw is the frequency of a pump

∼

wave. The Q-factor of resonator for frequency ωw should be suﬃcient to create a magnetic

ﬁeld amplitude about 100 Gs - 1 KGs. It follows from the energy balance equation in res-

Q = ωw

8π = W0 ( W0 is the power of pump wave formed by an electron beam ) that
8π , where V is the cavity volume, Hm is the amplitude of a magnetic ﬁeld of dy-
namic wiggler. When the pump ﬁeld achieves necessary magnitude, the stage b) begins. The

W0 V H 2

created pump wave acts as undulator during this stage. Non-one-dimensional distributed

feedback can also be realized for the signal wave. Dynamics of a signal electromagnetic wave

and an electron beam in the system ”volume diﬀraction grating + pump electromagnetic

The requirement of equality of determinant of (5) to zero corresponds to excitation of

a system in the absence of incident waves. Respective expression is named the generation

threshold equation.

The expansion (4) of a ﬁeld is valid for oversized system, when transverse dimensions

exceed radiation wavelength. If ttransverse dimensions are comparable with a wavelength,

the expansion over plane waves is replaced by the expansion over eigenmodes of waveguide.

the terms describing losses of the radiation on boundaries (the ﬁrst term in a right-hand side

of (6)) and losses determined by radiation absorption (the second term in a right-hand side

with the number of wave n increase. Let us note that the system can work as generator

without dynamic diﬀraction (in the one-wave case). Such situation is realized if a wave has

a group velocity directed opposite to electron beam velocity. In this case (5) looks like

It follows from the analysis of (8), however, that generation in this case takes place only in

the regime of strong ampliﬁcation (kImδL∗ & 1). Besides, the frequency of a signal wave

has the same order or less then the frequency of a pumping wave in this case. Therefore,

such branch of generation does not represent interest.

III. DISCUSSION

Let’s write the condition of synchronism between electron beam and signal wave in VFEL
~k~vw = Ωw. Here Ωw =

at the presence of pumping wave created at the ﬁrst stage: ω
ωw + ~vw~kw.

If generated system is oversized with respect to pumping wave (transverse

−

dimensions essentially exceed the pumping wavelength D

λ), otherwise Ωw = ωw + hvwz,

≫

where h is waveguide eigenvalue for the pumping wave. So the frequency of signal wave is

approximately equal to

dynamic wiggler allows to control the period of wiggler and the frequency of a signal wave

by either diﬀraction grating rotation or change of velocity direction. Smooth change of

VFEL geometry also varies the Q-factor and, therefore, varies the generation eﬃciency. For

example dependence of Q on diﬀraction asymmetry factor η = γ0/γ1 for a two-wave case is

shown on Fig.2. The signal wave can also be in condition of dynamical diﬀraction. Bragg

synchronism in this case is provided by diﬀraction grating with lesser period (the wavelength

of signal wave is less then the wavelength of pumping wave) [2]. For radiation angle Θ = 0

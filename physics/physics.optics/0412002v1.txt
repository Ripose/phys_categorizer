A technique is demonstrated which efﬁciently transfers light between a tapered standard single-mode optical
ﬁber and a high-Q, ultra-small mode volume, silicon photonic crystal resonant cavity. Cavity mode quality fac-
104 are measured, and a total ﬁber-to-cavity coupling efﬁciency of 44% is demonstrated. Using this
tors of 4.7
efﬁcient cavity input and output channel, the steady-state nonlinear absorption and dispersion of the photonic
crystal cavity is studied. Optical bistability is observed for ﬁber input powers as low as 250 µW, corresponding
to a dropped power of 100 µW and 3 fJ of stored cavity energy. A high-density effective free-carrier lifetime for
0.5 ns is also estimated from power dependent loss and dispersion
these silicon photonic crystal resonators of

INTRODUCTION

Recently it has been demonstrated that resonant microcavi-
ties formed in planar photonic crystals (PC) are capable of not
only conﬁning light to ultra-small optical mode volumes, but
also of realizing photon cavity lifetimes large enough [1, 2, 3]
to enable, for instance, reaching strong-coupling with atomic
Cs [4] or semiconductor quantum dots [5, 6, 7]. The en-
hancement to the local energy density enabled by PC cavi-
ties is also of signiﬁcant interest in nonlinear optics, as it re-
duces the input power required for nonlinear effects, such as
optical bistability [8, 9]. However, in addition to requiring
large ﬁeld enhancements and photon lifetimes, many of the
proposed applications of PC cavities in quantum, nonlinear,
and integrated optics, demand the ability to efﬁciently inter-
face the PC cavity with external optics. For example, using
high-Q PC cavities for chip based cavity-QED (cQED) [4]
or in single-photon sources [10], where photon collection is
an important measure of device performance [11, 12, 13], re-
quires an efﬁcient coupling scheme to the sub-micron cavity
mode. Similarly, proposed applications of microresonators in
nonlinear-optical switching circuits [14] puts a premium on
reduced input power and efﬁcient optical coupling techniques.
The difﬁculty in optically accessing PC cavities is largely
a result of their ultra-small mode volume and external radia-
tion pattern, which unlike micropost [15] and Fabry-P´erot [16]
cavities, is not inherently suited to coupling with conventional
free-space or ﬁber optics. Only recently have low-loss ﬁber
coupling techniques to planar photonic crystal waveguides
been demonstrated experimentally, using on-chip spot size
1-4 dB loss/port [17, 18]), out-of plane diffrac-
converters (
∼
8-10 dB loss/port [19, 20]), and narrow-band
tion gratings (
evanescent coupling (
0.1 dB loss/port [21]). In this paper
we employ the latter technique to efﬁciently source and collect
light from a silicon (Si) high-Q PC cavity via a photonic crys-
tal waveguide (PCWG) [22] which is evanescently coupled to
a ﬁber taper [23]. Using a mode-matched PCWG-PC cavity
design [24] to minimize parasitic loading of the PC cavity,

cavities loaded to 60% of critical and maintaining a Q-factor
104 are demonstrated, and a total ﬁber-to-cavity
close to 4
coupling efﬁciency of 44% is measured. The utility of this ef-
ﬁcient ﬁber coupling technique is then demonstrated in stud-
ies of the power dependent nonlinear response of the PC cav-
ity. We observe optical bistability for 100 µW dropped cavity
power, and predict sub-nanosecond free carrier lifetimes in the
cavity.

An outline of the paper is as follows. We begin in Section
II with a description of the ﬁber-to-cavity coupling scheme,
with speciﬁc emphasis on issues associated with the complex
modal properties of a photonic crystal microcavity. In Sec-
tion III we augment this linear theory by incorporating non-
linear processes which depend upon the magnitude of the in-
ternally stored cavity energy. Low power measurements of
a fabricated silicon photonic crystal waveguide-cavity system
are presented in Section IV, where optical ﬁber taper prob-
ing is used to both conﬁrm the localized nature of a PC cavity
resonance and to study the losses in the ﬁber-cavity system.
Higher power measurements in which nonlinear effects be-
come apparent are studied in Section V, and the model pre-
sented in Section III is used to estimate the scale of the differ-
ent nonlinear processes within the silicon PC cavity. Finally,
a summary is given in Section VI.

II. COUPLING SCHEME - THEORY

An illustration of the coupling scheme is shown in Figs.
1(a) and 1(b). In this scheme, evanescent coupling between an
optical ﬁber taper and a PCWG is used to interface with the
PC chip. Once on the chip, light is guided to a PC microcavity
at the terminus of the PCWG. Light that is reﬂected from the
PC cavity is then recollected into the backward propagating
ﬁber taper mode, where it is separated from the forward prop-
agating input signal using a ﬁber splitter. In this way a single
optical ﬁber is used to both source and collect light from the
PC microcavity.

The PC waveguide and PC microcavity studied here are
formed from a two-dimensional photonic crystal consisting
of a square lattice array of air holes in an optically thin slab
waveguide. This PC cavity-waveguide system was previously

A. Efﬁcient waveguide to cavity loading

As proposed in Ref. [25] in the context of microsphere res-
onators, the interaction between a PC cavity and an external
PC waveguide can be described by two key parameters, the
coupling parameter K and the ideality factor I:

where the cavity mode is characterized by its resonance fre-
quency w o, its intrinsic photon loss rate in absence of the ex-
ternal PCWG (g i), and its coupling rates to the fundamental
TE1 mode (g e
0) and higher order (including radiating) modes
of the external PCWG (g e
j>0). I describes the degree of “good”
loading, via the PCWG TE1 mode in this case, relative to the
total loading of the resonator. K, on the other hand, is the ratio
of “good” loading to the parasitic and intrinsic loss channels
of the resonator.

The coupling parameter K determines the on-resonance
fraction of optical power reﬂected by the cavity back into the
PCWG mode,

fer (critical coupling) from the “good” loading channel to the
resonant PC cavity mode occurs when K = 1.

Whereas K determines the amount of power dropped by the
resonator, the role of I is more subtle. In the case of an internal
emitter, the collection efﬁciency (h 0) of emitted photons into
the “good” loading channel is given by,

sured by the drop in loaded quality factor of the resonant cav-
ity mode, which can be written in terms of K, I, and Qi as

(see Fig. 2). The parabolic “potential” is a result of the longitudinal

studied theoretically in Ref.
[24], where the fundamental
(TE1) mode of the PCWG was designed to mode-match with
the fundamental (A0
2) cavity mode. The mode pattern of the
TE1 PCWG mode and the A0
2 cavity mode, calculated using
the ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, are shown
in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d), respectively. The mode-matched
cavity acts as a mirror with high modal reﬂectivity, ro(w ), ex-
cept at frequencies of the localized cavity states, where light
can resonantly tunnel between the PCWG and the cavity. Pre-
vious studies have shown that the optical ﬁber-PCWG evanes-
cent coupler has near unity coupling efﬁciency (97%) over a
bandwidth of roughly 15 nm [21], thus providing the neces-
sary efﬁcient ﬁber-chip optical interface. Also, in an indepen-
dent study, the fundamental A0
2 mode of the graded square lat-
104 and
tice PC cavity was measured to have a Q-factor of 4
a mode localization consistent with an effective mode volume
of Veff = 0.9(l /n)3[3].

×

Here we combine these two complementary components,
and study the efﬁciency with which the PC cavity is loaded
by the mode-matched, ﬁber-coupled PCWG. We begin with a
review of some of the key parameters describing the loading of
a general resonant structure, pointing out speciﬁc implications
for planar PC microcavities.

Thus, for a given collection efﬁciency, to maintain a long cav-
ity photon lifetime, I should be maximized.

Utilizing a cavity loading method with I

tant for cavity based nonlinear optics. A simple argument can
be made by studying the stored energy inside a resonant cavity
for a given input power. One can write for the on-resonance

The integrated PC cavity-waveguide design employed here
has two important features which serve to maximize I: (i) the
waveguide and cavity modes have similar transverse ﬁeld pro-
ﬁles (see Figs. 1(c-d)) which allows the cavity to be efﬁciently
loaded end-on, and (ii) the end-ﬁre PCWG-cavity geometry
restricts the cavity to a single dominant output channel, in con-
trast to side-coupled [2], in-line [26], and direct taper coupled
[3] geometries, in which the cavity radiates equally into back-
ward and forward propagating waveguide modes (bounding
K
0.5). In comparison to other microcavity sys-
tems, the geometry of the PC cavity-waveguide studied here is
analogous to a Fabry-P´erot cavity with a high reﬂectivity back
mirror and a lower reﬂectivity front mirror through which a
mode-matched input beam sources the cavity. The geome-
try is also similar to a side-coupled traveling wave resonator,
such as a microsphere or microdisk that supports whispering-
gallery type modes, in which the traveling wave resonance ra-
diates selectively into a single phase matched output channel.

INFLUENCE OF NONLINEAR ABSORPTION AND

DISPERSION ON CAVITY RESPONSE - THEORY

Owing to the ultra-small mode volume and long resonant
photon lifetimes of the PC cavities studied here, the resulting
stored electromagnetic energy density can be extremely large
even for modest input powers (< mW), resulting in highly

nonlinear behavior of the resonant cavity system.
to account for nonlinear effects one may modify the (lin-
ear) analysis of Section II A by allowing the various cavity
and coupling parameters to depend upon the stored cavity en-
ergy, a reasonably easy quantity to estimate from experimental
measurements. In this section, relevant nonlinear processes
are explicitly incorporated into the description of the cavity
response through use of carefully deﬁned effective modal vol-
umes and conﬁnement factors appropriate to nonlinear pro-
cesses in high-index contrast photonic crystal structures. We
begin with a description of nonlinear absorption, which tends
to drive the steady-state nonlinear response of the PC cavities
studied here.

A. Nonlinear absorption

3

Nonlinear absorption adds power dependent loss channels
to the photonic crystal cavity, degrading the quality factor as
the internal cavity energy is increased, which in turn modiﬁes
the coupling efﬁciency from the PCWG loading channel. This
effect is incorporated into the formalism presented in Section
II A by writing the intrinsic cavity loss rate, g i, explicitly in
terms of its various linear and nonlinear components:

FCA(U).

TPA(U) + g

g i(U) = g rad + g lin + g

(8)
At low power, the “cold cavity” loss rate is given by g rad and
g lin, which represent loss due to radiation and linear material
absorption, respectively. Power dependent nonlinear loss is
given here by g
FCA, which represent two-photon and
free-carrier absorption, respectively; other nonlinear absorp-
tion processes can be included analogously. The coupling pa-
rameter K and the quality factor Qi+P depend on g i, requir-
ing the solution of a system of self-consistent equations for U
in order to determine the on-resonance cavity response for a
given PCWG input power Pi:

Before eqs. (9 - 11) can be solved, explicit expressions for the
energy-dependent contributions to g i are required. Beginning
with relations for nonlinear absorption in bulk media, and tak-
ing into account the complicated geometry of the PC cavity,
we now derive expressions for g
FCA. These expres-
sions can be written in terms of the internal cavity energy,
known material parameters, and modal parameters which ac-
count for the mode shape and localization of the PC cavity
ﬁeld.

1. Two-Photon Absorption

The 1500 nm operating band of the devices studied in this
work lies in the bandgap of the host silicon material. For the
doping densities of the p-type silicon membrane used to form
the PC cavity (r
3), free-carrier
−
absorption due to ionized dopants is small (a
1).
Two-photon absorption however, is signiﬁcant[20, 27, 28, 29],
especially in the highly localized PC cavities. For a given ﬁeld
distribution, the (time-averaged) two-photon absorption loss
rate at position r can be written as

mittivity of free space, and n(r) is the local (unperturbed) re-
fractive index. The real, physical electric ﬁeld of the resonant

cavity mode can be written in terms of the complex mode pat-
iw ot + E∗(r)e+iw ot)/2. The material

sorption process, and can be related to the usual two-photon

Although, as mentioned above, the (linear) free-carrier ab-
sorption due to the ionized dopants of the silicon layer used for
the PC cavities in this work is negligible on the scale of other
losses, two-photon absorption gives rise to a steady-state pop-
ulation of electron and hole free-carriers far above this equi-
librium value. Two-photon absorption induced free-carrier ab-
sorption thus plays a signiﬁcant role in the silicon PC cavity
nonlinear response. At position r in the cavity, assuming a
simple Drude model, the optical loss rate due to free-carrier
absorption is

experimentally[30] that this model correctly describes absorp-
tion by both electrons and holes, albeit with unique values of

of electron-hole pairs[46], and take s

′ = s

In general, the derivation of the free-carrier density for a
given two-photon absorbed power distribution requires a mi-
croscopic theory taking into account carrier diffusion, carrier-
carrier scattering effects (Auger recombination for instance),
and in the highly porous PC cavities, local surface recombi-
nation effects. In lieu of such an analysis, we approximate
the free-carrier density distribution by considering the local
two-photon absorbed power,

Equation (19) neglects non-local effects due to spatial carrier
diffusion by assuming that N(r) depends only on the power
absorbed at position r; however, it does correlate regions of
strong two-photon absorption with high free-carrier density.
Also, since t generally depends on N and on the proximity to
surfaces, t will have a spatial dependence within the cavity.
We neglect this effect here, and let t
represent an effective
free-carrier lifetime for all the carriers in the cavity region[47].

Equations (22) and (16) represent the total loss rate of pho-

terial parameters, modal conﬁnement factors G TPA,FCA, effec-
tive mode volumes VTPA,FCA, and the internal cavity energy
U. The modal parameters take account of the non-trivial ge-
ometry and ﬁeld distribution of the cavity mode, and can be
determined for a given mode from ﬁnite difference time do-
main simulations. Including expressions (22) and (16) in g i,
eqs. (9 - 11) can be solved iteratively for Qi+P and K, which
characterize the on-resonance nonlinear response of the cavity
for a given input power.

B. Nonlinear and thermal dispersion

In addition to modifying the cavity quality factor, large cav-
ity energy densities also modify the refractive index of the
cavity, resulting in a power dependent resonance frequency.
Here we consider the role of the Kerr effect, free-carrier dis-
persion, and heating due to linear and nonlinear absorption,
on the dispersive response of the PC cavity. The refractive in-
dex shift induced through the processes considered here is a
function of both space and internal cavity energy. The renor-
malization of the resonant cavity frequency, resulting from
small local perturbations in the refractive index, can be ap-
proximated using ﬁrst order perturbation theory as

Lorentzian frequency dependence of the cavity response:

with n′2,Si and nSi the Kerr coefﬁcient and linear refractive in-
dex of Si, respectively. As both the Kerr effect and two photon
absorption (TPA) share the same dependence on ﬁeld strength,
the conﬁnement factor and effective mode volume associated
with the Kerr effect are equal to those of TPA,

G Kerr = G TPA

For input powers sufﬁcient to shift D

quency response described by eq. (27) is bistable, and can be
exploited for applications including temperature locking and
optical switching [31, 32, 33]. In order to solve eq. (27) for
the cavity response, it is necessary to derive expressions for
each of the constituents of D n as a function of U. We begin
with the Kerr effect.

fect is

a material dependent thermo-optical coefﬁcient. Neglecting
differences in the spatial distributions[50] of the contributions
to D T (r) from the various absorption processes, and assuming
that D T (r) scales linearly with absorbed power density for a
ﬁxed spatial heating distribution, the modal index shift can be

an appreciable index shift, and dT /dPabs is the thermal resis-
tance of the PC cavity which relates the mean modal temper-
ature change to the total absorbed power. In what follows we
lump these two factors together, yielding an effective thermal
resistance of the PC cavity.

From eqs. (30), (34), and (38), the total modal index change
and corresponding resonance frequency shift can be deter-
mined as a function of cavity energy. The nonlinear lineshape
described by eq. (27) can then be calculated iteratively as a
function of input power when combined with the power de-
pendent loss model of sub-section III A. This is used below
in Section V to estimate the scale of the different nonlinear
processes in silicon PC microcavities.

As a ﬁnal comment we note that the above analysis has
assumed a steady-state optical, carrier, and thermal distribu-
tion, whereas of signiﬁcant practical interest for applications
such high speed switching is the transient response of such
structures. Although the Kerr nonlinearity, two-photon ab-
sorption, free-carrier absorption, and free-carrier dispersion
all depend on the electronic structure of the semiconductor
material, the sub-micron geometry typical of photonic crys-
tals can also play an important role. For example, the sur-
faces introduced by the slab and air hole geometry of planar
PC cavities can signiﬁcantly modify the free-carrier lifetime t
compared to that in bulk material[31, 35, 36]. Similarly, the
thermal response time scales inversely with the spatial scale
of the optically absorbing region, and depends upon the ge-
ometry and material dependent thermal properties of a given
structure [34]. Although not the focus of the work presented
here, an inkling of these effects is seen in the sub-nanosecond
estimated effective free-carrier lifetime in the silicon PC cav-
ity studied below.

IV. EFFICIENT COUPLING INTO A HIGH-Q CAVITY
MODE

∼

The integrated PC cavity-PCWG devices described in Sec-
tion II were fabricated in an optically thin layer (thickness 340
nm) of silicon as described in Ref. [37]. A typical device is
shown in Fig. 2, which also shows the regions in which un-
patterned silicon was removed to allow taper probing of the
PC devices. In addition to isolating the PC devices on a mesa
of height
10 µm, a trench extending diagonally from the
cavity was deﬁned. This allowed the cavity to be probed di-
rectly by the ﬁber taper as in Ref. [3]. Indirect, yet much more
efﬁcient coupling to the PC cavity, was performed using the
scheme described in Sec. II by aligning the ﬁber taper along
the axis of the PCWG and coupling through the PCWG into
the PC cavity. The ﬁber taper was mounted in a “u”-shape
on a DC motor z-stage with 50 nm encoder resolution, pro-
viding accurate vertical placement of the taper above the Si
chip. In the measurements described below the taper was held
ﬁxed in the x-y plane parallel to the Si chip surface, and in-
plane positioning of the Si chip was performed using a pair of
DC motor stages with similar encoder resolution. A rotation
and goniometer stage, mounted to the x-y stages, was used to
align the in-plane and vertical angle of the sample relative to

6

the taper, respectively. The entire sample and taper system
was enclosed in an acrylic box to reduce taper ﬂuctuations
due to air currents in the room. Further details of the ﬁber ta-
per fabrication and mounting geometry can be found in Refs.
[3, 21, 37].

∼

A ﬁber-coupled swept wavelength (1565 - 1625 nm) laser
source was used to measure the wavelength dependent for-
ward transmission (T ) through the ﬁber taper, and a ﬁber split-
ter was used to monitor the signal in the backward propagat-
ing ﬁber taper mode (R). With the taper aligned with the
etched trench, the spectral and spatial properties of the PC
cavity modes were probed directly (Fig. 3(a), taper position
(ii)), as in Ref. [3]. The trench prevents the ﬁber taper from
interacting with the unpatterned silicon, and light is coupled
directly from the ﬁber taper into the high-Q PC cavity modes.
Although this coupling is inefﬁcient (D T =1-10%, I
1), it

1 µm, which aligns the taper-PCWG
for a taper diameter d
coupler bandwidth with the A0
2 PC cavity mode wavelength.
This signal is normalized to the taper transmission in absence
of the PCWG, and since light passes through the taper-PCWG
coupler twice, is given by R = h 2
wgRo, where h wg is the taper-
PCWG coupling efﬁciency. Note that both Ro and h wg are
frequency dependent. In Figure 4(a), the peak in R around
1590 nm corresponds to the phase-matched point of the
ﬁber taper and the TE1 PCWG mode. From the peak value of
Rmax = 0.53, a maximum taper-PCWG coupling efﬁciency of
h wg
73% is estimated, where the off-resonant Ro is taken to
be unity. This value is lower than the 97% obtained in pre-
vious work [21] due to coupling to additional higher-order
(normal to the Si slab) PCWG modes which interfere with
the coupling to the fundamental TE1 PCWG mode for strong
taper-PCWG coupling. This can be avoided in future devices
by increasing the nominal PCWG hole size relative to that in
the PC-cavity or reducing the Si slab thickness, effectively
freezing out the higher-order PCWG modes [37].

The sharp dip in reﬂection at l

1589.7 nm, shown in de-
tail in Fig. 4(b), corresponds to resonant excitation of the A0
2
PC cavity mode, as conﬁrmed by the direct ﬁber probing of
the cavity described above. The other broad features in R cor-
respond to weak Fabry-P´erot effects of the PCWG, and weak
interference between the TE-1 mode and higher order PCWG
modes. The reﬂected ﬁber taper signal as a function of taper-
PCWG gap height, g, is shown in Fig. 4(c). For g
0.8
µm, Rmax increases with decreasing g as the coupling from the
ﬁber taper to the TE1 PCWG mode becomes stronger. The re-
R(w o))/Rmax,
ﬂection contrast, D R = 1
remains constant, since the PCWG-cavity interaction is inde-
pendent of the ﬁber taper to PCWG coupling. For smaller
taper-PCWG gap heights, g < 0.8 µm, ﬁber taper coupling
into higher order PCWG modes and radiation modes becomes
appreciable, and Rmax decreases for decreased taper height.
The corresponding increase in D R seen in Fig. 4(c) is a re-
sult of interference between the TE1 mode and higher-order
PCWG modes which are excited and collected by the taper,
and is not a manifestation of improved coupling between the
TE1 PCWG mode and the A0
2 PC cavity mode. Direct coupling
between the taper and the cavity is negligible here.

In the device studied here, when the taper was aligned with
500 nm above the cavity, a sharp

dip in T was observed at a wavelength of l o
1589.7 nm.
It was conﬁrmed that this was due to coupling to a localized
cavity mode by studying the depth of the resonance as the
D x

the PC-cavity. The measured normalized resonance depth as
a function of taper displacement is shown in Figure 3(b), and
has a halfwidth of 480 nm, consistent with previous studies of
the localized A0

2 cavity mode[3].

The ﬁber taper was then aligned above and parallel to the
PCWG (Fig. 3(a), taper position (i)). At taper-PCWG phase-
matching wavelengths, T decreases resonantly as power is
coupled from the taper into the PCWG; coupling to the TE1
PCWG mode was veriﬁed by studying the dispersive and spa-
tial properties of the coupling, as in Ref. [37]. The ﬁber taper-
PCWG coupling bandwidth was adjusted to overlap with the
wavelength of the A0
2 cavity mode using two mechanisms.
Coarse tuning was obtained by adjusting, from sample to sam-
ple, the nominal hole size and longitudinal lattice constant
(L
z) of the PCWG. Fine tuning of the coupler’s center wave-
length over a 100 nm wavelength range was obtained by ad-
justing the position, and hence diameter, of the ﬁber taper re-
gion coupled to the PCWG [37]. Different degrees of cavity
loading were also studied by adjusting the number of periods
(9-11) of air holes between the center of the PC cavity and
the end of the PCWG. In the device studied below (shown in
Fig. 2) the PC cavity was fabricated with 9 periods on the side
adjacent the PCWG and 18 periods on the side opposite the
PCWG .

sponds to the total percentage of photons input to the ﬁber
taper which are dropped by the PC cavity. Based upon these
measurements, in the case of an internal cavity source such
as an atom or a quantum dot, the efﬁciency of light collec-
tion into the ﬁber taper for this PC cavity system would be
h out = h wgh 0
18%). As the tapers themselves
are of comparably very low loss, with typical losses associ-
ated with the tapering process less than 10%, these values ac-
curately estimate the overall optical ﬁber coupling efﬁciency.
Finally, note that previous measurements of near-ideal cou-
pling between the ﬁber taper and PCWG [21] indicate that
by adjusting the PCWG as described above to improve h wg,
in and h out can be increased to 58% and 18%, respectively.
More substantially, adjustments in the coupling parameter K

V. NONLINEAR MEASUREMENTS

The nonlinear response of the PC cavity was studied by
measuring the dependence of the reﬂected signal lineshape on
the power input to the PCWG. Figure 5 shows wavelength
scans of the cavity response Ro for varying power, Pt, input
to the ﬁber taper. Each scan was obtained by dividing the
normalized reﬂected signal, R, by the slowly varying taper-
PCWG coupler lineshape, h 2
In all of the measure-
ments, the ﬁber taper was aligned near the optimal taper-
PCWG coupling position, and the wavelength of the laser
source was scanned in the direction of increasing l
. Pt was
determined by taking taper insertion loss into account, and
measuring the taper input power with a calibrated power me-
ter.

wg(w ).

Increasing the power in the ﬁber taper, and consequently the
PCWG, results in three readily observable changes in Ro: (i) a
decrease in the resonance contrast, D Ro, (ii) a shift D
o in the
resonance frequency w o, and (iii) broadening and asymmet-
ric distortion of the resonance lineshape, eventually leading to
a “snap” in the reﬂection response characteristic of bistabil-
ity [38]. Here we use the theory presented in Section III to
show that these features are due to nonlinear absorption and
dispersion in the PC cavity.

Figure 6(a) shows Pd, the on-resonance power dropped into
the PC cavity, as a function of Pi, the power incident on the
cavity from the PCWG. Pd is measured from Pd = D Ro(Pi)Pi,
and Pi is related to the taper input power by Pi = h wg(w o)Pt .
For small Pi, Pd increases with a constant slope equal to the
“cold cavity” value of D Ro = 0.60 measured in Section IV.
For larger Pi, Pd becomes sub-linear versus Pi as loss due
to nonlinear absorption becomes appreciable compared to the
other loss channels of the PC cavity. In the context of the anal-
ysis of Section III, g i increases with increasing Pd, degrading
K, and decreasing D Ro (for K < 1). From the “cold cavity”
h 0 and QT measured in the previous section, the power de-
pendent Qi+P(Pi) can be extracted from D Ro(Pi) through the

Equation (40) is useful for powers where nonlinear effects dis-
tort the Lorentzian lineshape, and l o/d
is not an accurate
measure of QT (Pi). Using eqs. (40) and (7), the internal cav-
ity energy, U, can be calculated from Pi and D Ro.
Figure 6(b) shows a plot of the measured[51] D

o, the res-
onance wavelength shift, as a function of U. This plot has
several noteworthy properties. First, the wavelength shift is
nonlinear in U, indicating that nonlinear processes such as
free-carrier dispersion and heating through nonlinear absorp-
tion must be taking effect. Also, for small U the resonance
wavelength is seen to blue shift. In the 1550 nm wavelength
band of operation both dnSi/dT and n2,Si are > 0, while
d(D nFCD)/dU < 0, indicating that free-carrier dispersion is
the dominant dispersive process at low input powers. For
U > 0.34 fJ (Pd > 10 µW), the resonance wavelength begins

Pd(Pi), and dispersive, D

presented in Section III. Speciﬁcally, eqs. (9-11) were solved
for Pd and U as a function of Pi, and eq. (25) was used to
calculate D

as: (i) the effective free-carrier lifetime, t , (ii) the effective
thermal resistance of the PC cavity, G

fraction of the “cold cavity” loss which is due to linear ab-
sorption (as opposed to radiation), h

onators fabricated using the same SOI wafers and the same
processing techniques[39], and by comparing the etched sur-
face area seen by the PC cavity mode to that seen by a mi-
crodisk mode, we chose to use h
0.40 for the PC cavity.
With this value of h
lin the optimal value of the effective cavity
thermal resistance, G
thdT /dPabs, was found to be 27 K/mW,
of the same order of magnitude as the result calculated in Ref.
[40] for a similar membrane structure. Finally, the point-by-
point least-squared optimum values of t (Pi) were then ﬁt with
1 = A + BNa as a func-
a smooth curve of functional form t −

ﬁt, smooth ﬁts to measured Pd(Pi) and D

The various components of the total cavity loss rate and

dominate the PC cavity response, the free-carriers it generates

the nonlinear behavior of the silicon PC cavity at low and high
input powers, respectively. The ﬁt effective free-carrier life-
time, shown in Fig. 8, shows similar characteristics to that

the high-carrier density free-carrier lifetime are signiﬁcantly
different from that found in bulk Si, and are most likely re-
lated to carrier diffusion and surface effects owing to the ex-
tremely large surface-to-volume ratio of the PC cavity, the
200 nm feature size), and the
small length scales involved (
∼
small size scale of the optical mode[35]. This small effective
free-carrier lifetime is consistent with other recent experimen-
tal results of highly porous silicon optical structures[31, 36].
It should, however, be noted that the bulk Si TPA coefﬁcient
was used in modelling the nonlinear response of the PC cav-
ity, which given the above comments may not be accurate due
to surface modiﬁcation of TPA. As the effects of free-carrier
lifetime and two-photon absorption on the behaviour of the
dispersive and absorptive nonlinear response of the PC cavity
are somewhat intertwined, further studies will be necessary to
concretely separate these two phenomena in porous Si struc-
tures such as the photonic crystals of this work.

Q ultra-small mode volume PC cavities. By employing a
PCWG which supports a mode which is simultaneously spa-
tially mode matched with the high-Q PC cavity mode of in-
terest and phase matched with an optical ﬁber taper, efﬁ-
cient ﬁber-PCWG-cavity coupling is enabled. A total ﬁber-
to-cavity coupling efﬁciency of 44% is demonstrated, which
for the case of an internal cavity emitter corresponds to a ra-
diated photon collection efﬁciency of 13%. These values are
not fundamental limits of this technique, and can be improved
through ﬁne tuning of the photonic crystal. The efﬁciency
of this ﬁber coupling method was then exploited to probe the
steady-state nonlinear optical properties of the PC cavity. The
effect of two-photon absorption, free-carrier absorption and
dispersion, Kerr self-phase modulation, and thermo-optic dis-
persion, on the response of the PC cavity was considered. Op-
tical bistability at ﬁber input powers of 250 µW was observed,
and a free-carrier lifetime with high carrier density value as
low as
0.5 ns is inferred from nonlinear absorptive and dis-
persive measurements of the PC cavity. Along with applica-
tions to nonlinear optics, this optical ﬁber evanescent coupling
based approach should be useful for future experiments in in-
tegrated micro-optics with photonic crystals, and in particular
to cQED systems employing photonic crystals, where quan-
tum computing and communication protocols demand high
optical ﬁdelity.

[45] One can show[43, 44] that

the appropriate weighting is
n2(r)E2(r), proportional to the local electric ﬁeld energy den-
sity. Note also that the time averaged electromagnetic energy
(1/2)e on2(r)E2(r)dr for a harmonic
stored in the cavity, U, is
mode in a non-dispersive dielectric.

[46] We neglect the small (< 1

carrier hole density due to the ionized acceptors of the p-type
Si layer used in this work.

[47] In using the approximate theory above, in which regions of high
two-photon absorbed power are correlated with high steady-
state carrier density, we better approximate the cavity “volume”
of interest, and consequently the effective free-carrier lifetime
better represents the average time a free-carrier stays in the re-
gion of the PC cavity mode.

[48] This expression neglects the tensor nature of the third order sus-
ceptibility. A more general expression, which includes the ten-
sor nature of the Kerr effect, is given in Ref. [9].

[49] Experimental results[30] indicate that this Drude model must be
modiﬁed slightly to accurately describe the contribution from
hole free-carriers in silicon, which scales with N0.8
h . For sim-
plicity, we ignore this in the following analysis, and note that
the modiﬁcation is straightforward, and is included in later nu-
merical results.

[50] Heating due to each absorption process will result in a spatial
temperature proﬁle given by solving the heat equation. In gen-
eral the different processes have different spatial heating, and
therefore temperature, proﬁles.

[51] Note that the sharp transition edge associated with optical bista-
bility occurs at the cavity resonance wavelength when scanning
from blue to red, thus an accurate measure of D
o can be made,
even if one of d
cannot.

[52] Note that since we have two data points for each input power,
one dispersive and one absorptive, there will be an optimum
t (Pi) with non-zero residual error.

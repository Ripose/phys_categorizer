In the context of the optical properties of arrays of sub-
initially introduces by
wavelength holes in metallic layer,
Ebbessen et al, we demonstrate that the maxima of transmis-
sion do not correspond to surface plasmon (SPs) resonance,
contrary to what it is generally suppose. We conﬁrm that SPs
wavelength calculated in the context of a void lattice are not
signiﬁcatively shifted toward greater wavelength despite the
presence of holes. We show the presence of Brewster modes
in a restricted wavelength domain in substitution to SPs. In
this way, the interest will be given to the notion of surface
eigen-modes (SEMs).

For several years, the motivation for investigating
metallic grating have been renewed in the context of the
results reported by Ebbesen et al on particularly attrac-
tive optical transmission experiments on periodical ar-
rays of subwavelength cylindrical holes in a thin metallic
layer deposited on glass (see ﬁg.1). Two speciﬁc char-
acteristics of their results are the transmission which is
higher than the simple sum of individual holes contri-
butions and the interesting pattern of the zeroth order
transmission versus wavelength [1]. During the last few
years, these experimental results have received consider-
able attention and they have implied several theoretical

been pointed out that surface plasmons (SPs) play a key
role in the features observed in the transmission curves
[1-5,7,8,11]. In fact, other assumptions were suggested
[6,9,10,12-14]. For instance, it has been suggested that
these phenomena can be described in terms of short range
diﬀraction of evanescent waves [12], or in terms of dy-
namical diﬀraction [6,14]. Another explanation suggest
the role of cavity resonance into the holes to explain the
transmission enhancement [9,10]. However, most of the-
orical studies deviate from the original Ebbesen devices
either from geometrical parameters or material proper-
ties which were sometimes idealized. If we except these
peculiar situations, SPs seems to keep a key role in the
Ebbesen eﬀect in the case of metallic gratings. This
is particularly important in the context of plasmonics.
However, it remains many questions which must be an-
swered in order to clarify the processes involved in these
experiments. The usual interpretation of the ”Ebbesen
experiments” lies on the fact that the maxima of trans-
mission corresponds to SPs resonances. More precisely,
the evanescent diﬀraction orders would exibit a resonant
coupling with SPs. Then, via multi-scattering, nonhomo-
geneous order give a contribution to the zeroth diﬀrac-
tion order. The strong exhaltation of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld related to the resonant processes appears through
the enhanced transmission [1-5,7,8,11]. In a recent work
[15], we have shown that the concept of resonant Wood
anomalies [18] can be invoked to interpret the role of
SPs in the Ebbesen experiments. We have shown that
the transmission pattern is better described by Fano’s
proﬁles correlated with interferences between non reso-
nant processes and the resonant response of the eigen-
modes coupled with nonhomogeneous diﬀraction orders.
We have shown that each maximum of transmission (pre-
ceded by a minimum) corresponds to one maximum of a
Fano’s proﬁle (preceded by the related minimum) [19].
Moreover, whereas such Fano’s proﬁle in transmission is
related to a resonant process, the location of its maxi-
mum (or minimum) does not necessarily correspond to
the location of the resonance (see ﬁg.2a) [15].
It has
been assumed that these resonances characterize SPs res-
onances since we used metal in our device. Nevertheless,
we have shown that, beyond of the importance of surface
plasmons, the key role in those phenomena is played by
the gratings eigen-modes. More precisely, we have shown
that SPs can be substituted by other kind of eigen modes
such that guided modes as example [16].

The purpose of the present paper is to underline some
speciﬁc characteristics of surface modes in the context
of the Ebbesen’s experiments. As a continuation of our
previous works, we turn our attention to the case of
chromium ﬁlms (ﬁg.1 and ﬁg.2a). In addition, we show
the role of Brewster modes in substitution to SPs, when
the real part of the permittivity of the chromium ﬁlm be-
comes weakly positive (ﬁg.2b). Indeed, SPs eigen modes
would be substituted by Brewster eigen modes. As a gen-
eralization, one talk about surface eigen-modes (SEMs).
Let us recall some properties of surface modes. We con-
sider an interface between two media 1 and 2 described
by their respective permittivity ε1 and ε2. It is well know
that in a such interface, only p polarized surface modes
can occurs [20]. Then the dispersion relation of surface
modes can be written in the form

k = k0

ε1ε2
ε1 + ε2

r

where k is the component of the wave vector of the surface
mode parallel to the interface and k0 = ω/c where ω is
the frequency of the mode. The normal component of
the wave vector of the surface mode in each medium is
then given by

(1)

(2)

kz,i =

where subscript i denotes the medium 1 or 2.
In the
following we suppose that ε1 is real and positive only, i.e.
2 + iε′′
medium 1 is a dielectric without loss, and ε2 = ε′
2
with ε′′
0, i.e. medium 2 is any material, possibly with

loss.

First, let us consider medium 2 as a metallic medium
with ε′
2 < 0. Then, surface modes correspond to SPs
modes. Usually, it is assume that ε′′
2 = 0. Then, it can be

SPs verify k > ω
c √ε1 and one talk about Fano modes [21-
24]. These modes are purely non radiative surface modes
since k is real and kz,i is imaginary. If the imaginary part
of the permittivity of the metal is not equal to zero we
talk about lossy Fano modes [21-24]. Indeed, k becomes
complex, and its imaginary part describe the decay of the
mode along to the interface. Fano modes are the most
usual and well know cases of SPs in optics. In another
way, if
< ε1 and only in presence of loss, SPs can
exist too. Then, SPs are often described by what is called
Zenneck modes. Such modes verify Re
c √ε1 [21-
24] and by deﬁnition are necessarily related to radiative
surface modes. To be more accurate, when
4 ε1
in the presence of loss only, SPs always correspond to

Zenneck modes. In addition, when
4 ε1, if
2 < εc then SPs are Zenneck modes and if ε′′

they are Fano modes, where εc is deﬁned as

Now, let us consider the case where medium 2 is a dielec-
tric medium with ε′
2 > 0. Obviously SPs do not exist and
it is well know that a dielectric without imaginary part
can’t support a surface mode as kz,i is real. Neverthe-
less, in a lossy dielectric, it exists surface modes known

Such modes are Zenneck modes too. Fig.3 summarize the
conditions for which the diﬀerent kind of modes occurs
(see also the appendix).

As an example, for metals such that iron, gold or
copper [25] and for usual dielectric medium, SPs are
Fano modes. However, in our case, as we use chromium
[25] SPs correspond either to Zenneck modes or to Fano
modes (Fig.2b).
In addition, there is a range of wave-
length for which the real part of the permittivity is pos-
itive (ﬁg.2b), and so, Brewster modes substitute SPs.
As a deﬁnition, these modes are generally called surface
eigen-modes (SEMs).

In the grating case, for normal incident light, in a void
lattice approximation, SEM resonance will appears to
the wavelength λi,j which correspond to SEMs resonance
taking account the periodicity of the grating and given by
the following equation (for a square grating of parameter
a and ω

where (i, j) denotes the related vector g of the reciprocal
lattice, such that g = 2π

a (i, j).

Now we study the properties of the SEMs in the case
of a grating similar to those studied by Ebbesen et al
and considering the case of chromium [4] (see ﬁg.1). In
the following, our simulations rest on a coupled modes
method (which takes into account the periodicity of the
device permittivity) associated with the use of the scat-
tering matrix formalism. In this way, we calculate the
amplitudes of the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁeld, for each
diﬀracted order (which correspond to a vector g of the
reciprocal lattice) according to their polarization (s or p)
[15].

Let us recall some basic results from our previous
works, related to the chromium grating case [15].
In
Fig.2a one can see the numerical simulation of the ze-
roth order transmission for an incident ligth normal to
the surface of a square grating (parameter a = 1000 nm)
made of circular holes (radius equal to 250 nm) in a thin
chromium ﬁlm (thickness equal to 100 nm) deposited on
glass (ﬁg.1). The incident electric ﬁeld is linearly po-
larized along to the grating axis [0, 1]. We note A and
B the main maxima of transmission. One can compare
the transmission with the resonant p polarized diﬀraction
orders (0,
1) for the substrate/metal interface (peak 1)
and for the vaccuum/metal interface (peak 2). One notes
that those peaks do not correspond to the maxima of
transmission as explain above. Then, this result meet
these obtain by Cao and Lalanne [13] although our inter-
pretation is diﬀerent. We have shown that the pattern
of the transmission around the resonance can be inter-
preted as a Fano’s proﬁle [15]. In the following, we will
prove that these peaks are related to SPs resonance as
supposed in our previous work, in the metallic domain
of chromium. By extension, we will show that SPs are
subtituted by Brewster modes in the dielectric domain of
chromium. In such context of the role of SEMs, we will
show that SEMs are weakly modiﬁed in relation to SEMs
calculated in the case of a void lattice approximation.

Fig 4a shows the position of both peaks (1) and (2)
respectively against grating parameter a (solid lines (1)
and (2) respectively). Calculation are made for a square
grating made of circular holes (radius equal to 250 nm)
in a thin chromium ﬁlm (thickness equal to 100 nm) de-
posited on glass.
Incident light is the same as above.
We compare these curves with the wavelength values ob-
tain from eq.5 against grating parameters a (dashed lines
(1) and (2) respectively) for the related diﬀraction or-
ders. One shows a very good agreement between the val-
ues obtain from eq.5 and those obtain numerically from
the location of resonance peaks. We show that as a in-
crease, resonance wavelength increase linearly according
to a as related by eq.5. In addition, the right columns
in ﬁg.4a denote wavelength domains for which each kind
of SEMs appear for resonance 1 and 2. One observes

2

that each kind of SEMs (Zenneck-Brewster modes, Fano-
SPs modes and Zenneck-SPs modes) can substitute to
each others continuously. Moreover, we show the loca-
tion of both maxima of transmission A (circle dots) and
B (square dots). One observes clearly that both can not
be identify to the resonances. These results corroborated
the fact that the maxima of transmission are not SEMs
resonances explicitely and that the resonances are well
related to SEMs excitation (by opposition to cavity reso-
nance for instance). Nevertheless, one shows that SEMs
wavelength from eq.5 and SEMs wavelength from numer-
ical computation do not strictly coincide. Then, Fig.4b
shown resonance wavelength shift against hole radius for
various resonant diﬀraction order normalized in relation
to their own SEMs resonance wavelength calculated for a
void lattice (from eq.5). We see that the relative variation
of the SEMs wavelength in relation to SEMs wavelength
calculated for a void lattice do not exceed 3 % whereas
the radius varies between 150 and 350 nm. One shows
that the hole presence do not signiﬁcatively modify SEMs
wavelength contrary to what it was supposed in previous
works [2].

In addition to these observations, ﬁg.5 shows SEMs
wavelength variation against metallic layer thickness h
for peaks (1) (ﬁg.5a) and (2) (ﬁg.5b). In both case vari-
ation curves are plotted for diﬀerent hole radius. For
the metal/subrate interface (ﬁg.5a) wavelength varia-
tions do not exceed 0.5 %, and for the vaccuum/metal
interface (ﬁg.5b), wavelength variations do not exceed
1.5 %. These variations are on the order of those ob-
tained when hole radius varies. One notes that, when
thickness increases, the wavelength tend toward constant
values. This denotes a coupling-decoupling eﬀect be-
tween each interface modes. Nevertheless, it must be
noted that the behaviour of the wavelength resonance
against thickness depends on the hole radius also. This
suggests that the coupling between each interface can’t
be simply explained by planar thin-ﬁlms SEMs [20], i.e.
Fuchs-Kliewer modes [26,27]. Moreover, the decaylength
δ = λ
of the ﬁeld, is on the order of 50 nm
2π
for a non-corrugated metallic ﬁlm along to its thickness
in the present case. This suggests that the role of the
coupling related to Fuchs-Kliewer modes must be weak
in the range of thickness values considered here. Never-
theless, as shown in previous works, each SEMs of each
interfaces plays a role in those phenomena, whatever the
direction of the incident light [1,2]. These results tend
to conﬁrm the coupling of each interfaces via the inner
holes surfaces [1,2,11]. More precisely, holes act as a sec-
ondary sources by generating diﬀracted light which can
excite the SEMs on the opposite interface to this light-
ening.

In previous works, it was inferred that the wavelength
for which SPs are excited are red-shifted from those cal-
culated for a void lattice [2]. It was supposed that such
a shift lead the maxima of transmission to coincide with
SPs renonances. In fact, it was suggested that the holes

in the ﬁlm may cause a signiﬁcant change in the plas-
mon dispersion such that that the frequencies obtained
for a void lattice would be strongly shifted by the pres-
ence of holes [2]. Nevertheless, as we have just shown,
it is not observed. Our own results show that the exact
resonant SEMs wavelength (numerically computed) are
not enough shifted to justify their location on maxima
of transmission. By contrast, our results tends to proves
that the SEMs resonances are eﬀectively located close to
the minima of transmission.

One aspect which must be underlined, is the decay of
SEMs along to the interface. Such decay depends of the
imaginary part of k in eq.(1), according to the fact that
, where g is a vector of
its real part must be equal to
the reciprocal lattice. In this way, as an example for a
square grating of parameter a = 1000 nm, surface modes
related to the orders (0,
1) for metal/vaccum inter-
±
face and metal/substrate respectively have a decaylength
of 7805 nm and 4442 nm respectively. Generally, de-
increases. Therefore,
caylength values decrease as
it is 1024 nm for order (2, 2) for metal/substrate inter-
face. It is particulary important that such decaylength
are greater than the grating parameter to ensure the cou-
pling between holes and the existence of bloch waves.
That means also that, in the present case, orders greater
than (2, 2) would not play a signiﬁcant role in such a
diﬀraction problem.

One note also, as suggested by Treacy [14], that eq.5
ignores the oﬀ-diagonal terms of the scattering matrix,
which describe the coupling between diﬀraction modes.
Such coupling would be responsible for SEMs shift. As-
suming our results, either the oﬀ-diagonal terms could be
negligible by comparison to diagonal terms or , if they
are not, compensation processes make their role negligi-
ble. We hope to clarify and detail such concepts in a
later work.

To conclude this paper, we have prove that contrary
to what it is generally suppose, SEMs wavelength calcu-
lated in the context of a void lattice are not signiﬁca-
tively shifted toward greater wavelength. In such way,
we have conﬁrm that the maxima of transmission do not

we corroborate our previous results [15,16]. At last, we
show that it can be possible to substitute SPs modes by
Brewster modes by the use of a lossy dielectric medium
in the same context.

APPENDIX

Let us consider a interface between two media de-
scribed by their relative permittivity ε1 and ε2. We
are looking for surface eigen-modes. For isotropic me-
dia, only p polarized modes can occur. Such modes can
be described by their magnetic components. The inter-
face is related to the plane Oxy, medium 1 corresponds
to z > 0 and medium 2 is such that z < 0. Assuming a
mode which propagate along to Ox, the magnetic ﬁeld is
then described as

An analytical description of arbitrary strongly aberrated axially symmetric focusing is developed.
This is done by matching the solution of geometrical optics with a wave pattern which is universal for
the underlying ray structure. The corresponding canonical integral is the Bessoid integral, which is a
three-dimensional generalization of the Pearcey integral that approximates the ﬁeld near an arbitrary
two-dimensional cusp. We ﬁrst develop the description for scalar ﬁelds and then generalize it to the
vector case. As a practical example the formalism is applied to the focusing of light by transparent
dielectric spheres with a few wavelengths in diameter. The results demonstrate good agreement with
the Mie theory down to Mie parameters of about 30. Compact analytical expressions are derived
for the intensity on the axis and the position of the diﬀraction focus both for the general case and
for the focusing by microspheres. The high intensity region is narrower than for an ideal lens of
the same aperture at the expense of longitudinal localization and has a polarization dependent ﬁne
structure, which can be explained quantitatively. The results are relevant for aerosol and colloid
science where natural light focusing occurs and can be used in laser micro- and nano-processing of
materials.

INTRODUCTION

Axially symmetric focusing of wave ﬁelds occurs in var-
ious areas of science, since physical systems often possess
an intrinsic rotational symmetry. In particular, the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld enhancement by small spherical parti-
cles is important in many situations. Spheres have mini-
mal surface energy for a given volume and thus are natu-
rally formed as a result of phase separation, for example
as aerosols or colloids. Applications of colloidal micro-
spheres in photonic crystals and photonic crystal slabs
led to an explosion of the experimental and theoreti-
cal studies of their optical properties.1,2 The majority of
these investigations concentrate on their collective prop-
erties in a periodic arrangement. Single microspheres
are used as high quality optical resonators and as agents
that allow controlled and highly localized wavelength-
dependent ﬁeld enhancement for non-linear optical stud-
ies and in resonance spectroscopy.3,4 Here, the emphasis
is placed on the eigenmode analysis and the distribution
of the ﬁeld within the sphere or in the immediate vicinity
of its surface.

Lately, it was demonstrated that self-assembling ar-
rays of transparent colloidal microspheres can be em-
ployed for high-throughput laser-assisted micro- and
nano-structuring of materials.5,6,7 Similar eﬀects were ob-
served in experiments on dry laser cleaning, where such
particles are used as controlled contaminants.8,9,10 This
necessitates better understanding of the focusing of light
by microspheres with diameters of several wavelengths.
Only few rigorous results are available for the interme-
diate range of sphere sizes and distances from the par-

ticle. The majority of analytical approaches either deal
with the properties of the eigenmodes, or refer to the in-
tegral characteristics and/or to the far ﬁeld behavior.11
Mie resonances were analyzed on the basis of advanced
geometrical optics12 and detailed numerical calculations
for transparent spheres of several wavelengths in size were
performed in connection with the use of laser tweezers in
biology13 and for needs of aerosol science.14

In this work we develop a theoretical description for
an arbitrary non-paraxial strongly aberrated axially sym-
metric focusing and apply it to the case of dielectric mi-
crospheres. Our emphasis is on the ﬁne structure of the
ﬁeld distribution in the exterior of the sphere up to the
focal region, which can be used to control and improve
the concentration of energy.

Strong spherical aberration makes the focusing non-
trivial. Usually, the exact solution is obtained using the
Mie theory,15 which does not give much of a physical
insight as it requires the summation of a large number of
terms in a multipole expansion even for moderate sphere
sizes. At the same time, the main focusing properties of
transparent dielectric microspheres originate rather from
the picture of geometrical optics.

One might think that in the lowest approximation a
small sphere acts as an ideal lens. However, in the range
of sizes we are interested in, this picture does not even
provide a description which is qualitatively correct. Also
classical formulas for weak spherical aberration16 do not
yield useful results for the ﬁeld behind a sphere: They
predict that the maximum intensity is kept unchanged
and its position does not depend on the wavelength.

Our approach, following the method of uniform caus-

tic asymptotics,17 is based on the canonical integral for
the cuspoid ray topology of strong spherical aberration.
Though this Bessoid integral — a member of the hier-
archy of diﬀraction catastrophes18,19 — appears natu-
rally in the paraxial approximation, it can be used to de-
scribe arbitrary axially symmetric strong spherical aber-
ration by appropriate coordinate and amplitude transfor-
mations. For angularly dependent vectorial amplitudes
the formalism uses higher-order Bessoid integrals.

The Bessoid integral is the axially symmetric general-
ization of the Pearcey integral,20 which plays an impor-
tant role in many short wavelength phenomena.21 There-
fore, the present approach can be applied in various areas
of physics where axially symmetric focusing is of impor-
tance, e.g., acoustics, semiclassical quantum mechanics,
radio wave propagation and scattering theory.

II. THE BESSOID INTEGRAL

A. Deﬁnition

We ﬁrst consider the diﬀraction of a scalar spherically
aberrated wave on a circular aperture with radius a in
the plane z =
f around the z-axis, where f is the focal
distance. The origin of the coordinate system is put into
the focus F . In cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z), the parax-
ial Fresnel–Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral16 yields the ﬁeld
amplitude

Here U0 is the amplitude of the incident wave in the cen-
ter of the aperture, k is the wavenumber (k = 2π/λ,
where λ is the wavelength) and
ρ1 is the distance from
the axis on the aperture. The Bessel function J0 comes
from the integration over the polar angle ϕ. The param-
eter B in the exponent determines the strength of the
spherical aberration. For B > 0 the diﬀraction focus
shifts towards the aperture, while B = 0 corresponds to
ideal focusing.16

Both integrals correspond to so-called diﬀraction
catastrophes.17,18,19 Their ﬁeld distribution contains
caustic zones where the intensity predicted by geomet-
rical optics goes to inﬁnity. The Pearcey integral corre-
sponds to a cusp caustic, i.e., a single one-dimensional
curve in a two-dimensional space, and does not reveal
a high intensity along the axis, while the Bessoid inte-
gral corresponds to a cuspoid caustic, i.e., to a surface
of revolution of the cusp in three dimensions, as well as
the caustic line up to the focus F at z = Z = 0. The
equation of the cusp is given by the semicubic parabola

27 R2 + 4 Z 3 = 0 .

(6)

Henceforth we will apply the term cusp also for the whole
cuspoid. A caustic is denoted as stable, if it does not
change its topology under small perturbations. This is
the case for the Pearcey integral. The Bessoid integral

corresponds to a structurally unstable caustic, because
an inﬁnitely small perturbation will destroy the radial
symmetry and the axis will not be a caustic zone any
longer. It is, however, stable on the class of axially sym-
metric wavefronts.

The cusp is the envelope of the family of rays. The
latter correspond to the points of stationary phase in the
Bessoid integral, i.e., those points where the two ﬁrst
partial derivatives with respect to R and Z of the phase
φ in (3) vanish. Inside the cusp, for 27 R2 + 4 Z 3 < 0,
three rays (tangents to the cusp) arrive at each point of
(ρ, z), and outside, for 27 R2 + 4 Z 3 >
observation P
0, there is only one real ray (ﬁgure 2). Thus, the cusp
forms the border between the lit region and the (partial)
geometrical shadow, where two rays merge.

≡

Without loss of generality, we assume that all rays lie
in the meridional plane ϕ = 0 (y1 = 0) and hence corre-
spond to the roots x1,j (j = 1, 2, 3) of the cubic equation

R + Z x1 + x3

1 = 0 ,

(7)

1 =

1 +y2

which are given by Cardan’s formulas.23 On the axis,
R = 0, a cone formed by an inﬁnite number of rays con-
verges. These rays originate from the circle x2
Z
on the aperture. They are all in phase and produce a
high intensity along the axis (compare the two pictures
in ﬁgure 1). The oscillations occur due to interference
with the ray propagating along the z-axis. One can also
directly observe that the Bessoid integral has the topol-
ogy of spherical aberration as the maximum of intensity
does not lie in the geometrical focus Z = 0 but is spheri-
cally aberrated to a negative value of Z, i.e., towards the
aperture.

B. Asymptotic expressions

Oﬀ the caustic — away from the cusp and the focal
line — the Bessoid integral (3) can be approximated by
the method of stationary phase. As the integrand in (3)
is highly oscillatory, the only signiﬁcant contributions to
the integral come from those regions where the phase is

where the summation runs over all real rays, i.e., m = 1
(lit region) or m = 3 (shadow). The phase φj is obtained
by inserting the j-th stationary point (x1,j , y1,j = 0) into
the (4). The determinant and signature of the Hessian
are given by

Near the cusp the Bessoid integral shows an Airy-type
behavior typical for caustics where two real rays disap-
pear and become complex.

One can also derive a diﬀerent approximation valid on
0 and small R

Here erfc is the complementary error function,25 which
can also be written in terms of Fresnel sine and cosine
functions.22 Expression (11) becomes exact at the axis
R = 0, where J0(0) = 1.
It shows that near the axis
the Bessoid integral is virtually a Bessel beam26 with a
variable cross section.

C. Numerical evaluation

As the Bessoid integrand is highly oscillatory, its eval-
uation for the whole range of coordinates R and Z is
non-trivial and of large practical importance. Direct nu-
merical integration along the real axis and the method
of steepest descent in the complex plane both have their
disadvantages. By far the fastest technique is based on
the numerical solution of the ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tion (derivation in appendix B)27,28

I(0, Z) was taken from (11), IR(0, Z) vanishes due to
symmetry, and the last condition arises from the fact
that the Bessoid integral satisﬁes the paraxial Helmholtz
equation 2 i IZ + L = 0, where IZ is calculated from (13).

In the literature the Pearcey integral was calcu-
lated by solving diﬀerential equations,29 by a series
representation30 and by the ﬁrst terms of its asymp-
totic expansion.31 The Bessoid integral was expressed in
terms of parabolic cylinder functions32 and as a series.22
The latter work gives reference to an unpublished work
of Pearcey,33 stating that diﬀerential equations for the
Bessoid integral were employed there.

D. Geometrical optics for the cuspoid

In geometrical optics, the rays carry the information
of amplitude and phase. The total ﬁeld in a point P is
given by the sum of all ray ﬁelds there. A ray’s ﬁeld at
P is determined by34

U (P ) = U0

e i k ψ
√J

,

(16)

(17)

where U0 is the amplitude at some initial wavefront, ψ
is the eikonal, and J is the generalized geometrical di-
vergence, which can be calculated from ﬂux conservation
along the ray. For a homogeneous medium with constant
refractive index34

J =

RmRs
Rm0Rs0

.

Rm, Rs are the main radii of curvature at the point P
and Rm0, Rs0 are the radii on the initial wavefront, where
U = U0.

−

When a ray touches a caustic, its radius of curvature
(the geometrical divergence in the general case) changes
the sign and the ray undergoes a caustic phase delay 17,34
of
π/2, which is taken into account by the proper choice
of the square root in (16). When a ray touches several
caustics, these delays must be added. The total caustic
phase shift, denoted as ∆ϕ, can be explicitly written in
the phase. For the cuspoid topology and ray numbering
(j = 1, 2, 3) according to ﬁgure 2, we obtain:

applications.

We want to describe arbitrary axially symmetric fo-
cusing by matching the solution of geometrical optics
(where it is correct) with a wave ﬁeld constructed from
the Bessoid integral (3), which naturally appears in the
paraxial approximation and is ﬁnite everywhere, and its
partial derivatives IR and IZ (method of uniform caustic

(26)

Note that they are functions of the Bessoid coordinates,
tj = tj(R), and the latter depend on the real space coor-
dinates: R = R(r). The partial derivatives with respect
to R and Z in (22) must be evaluated in such a way as
the tj were held constant, although they are functions
of R themselves. The conditions (22) and (23) give 6

also appears in the near axis approximation for the
Bessoid integral (11). On the axis (ρ = 0, ϕ1 = ϕ3)
we obtain R = 0 and Z =

2 √ϕ1 −
The results (32)–(34) have transparent physical mean-
ing.
Indeed, near the axis the largest contribution to
the ﬁeld comes from the converging cone of non-paraxial
rays (similar to ray 1) that intersect the axis at an angle
β. If the angle β is constant and all rays have the same
intensity, the result is the Bessel beam.26 Such beams
have a propagation constant along the z-direction equal
to the z-component of the wavevector of the plane waves
which form them and correspondingly the argument of
the Bessel function (cylindrical analog of a plane wave)
is equal to k ρ sin β. As the angle β gradually changes
for the spherically aberrated wave, so does the argument
of the Bessel function.

Additionally, there exists the axial ray 2, which is not
present in the canonical Bessel beam (though it often
appears in real experimental situations). The interfer-
ence of this beam with the converging ray cone results
in the intensity oscillations along the axis (ﬁgure 1, bot-
tom). Clearly, these oscillations are largely due to the
ϕp. At large negative Z in (11)
phase diﬀerence ϕnp −
√π Z exp(i 3π
erfc[ Z

2 [1

lating behavior is governed by the phase of the exponent,
which is equal to 3 π/4
ϕp). This clariﬁes the
(ϕnp −
origin of expression (33), as it is Z 2 entering the ﬁnal
formulas.

In particular, the global maximum is expected on axis
at the ﬁrst constructive interference of the axial and the
non-paraxial rays. Because Z < 0 in this region, the two
terms of the erfc expansion are ﬁrst in phase when the
ϕ2 = 3 π/4. The geometrical
phase diﬀerence is ϕ1 −
meaning of this result is that rays 1 and 3 are shifted by
π/2 as they touch the cusp. In addition, they acquire a

further shift of
π/2 when crossing the focal line. But ex-
actly on the axis only half of this delay has occurred yet,

which yields the 3 π/4 diﬀerence. The numerical maxi-
mum of the Bessoid intensity (absolute square) occurs at

below.

The structure of expression (37) helps to understand its
physical meaning. It details the contribution of the cone
of non-paraxial rays, represented by ray 1 (ﬁrst term),
and the axial ray 2 (second term) to the overall structure
of the ﬁeld. Note that in the general case not only the
angle β, but also the amplitude of the converging cone
may vary along z (Z), thus slowly modifying the proper-
ties of the Bessel beam in the axial region. This enters
(37) via amplitude transformations and is manifested by
the presence of the initial ray amplitudes in both terms.
Inside the cusp on the axis (z, Z < 0 and ρ, R
0)
both 1/√J2 and the ratio √ρ/√J1 remain ﬁnite as the
divergence of the paraxial ray 2 is non-singular, while the
sagittal divergence J1 of the cone of non-paraxial rays 1
is proportional to ρ. Due to the Bessoid matching pro-
cedure the singularity of the converging cone is removed
by the compensating factor √ρ. Along the axis the last
term in (37) partly cancels with the second term in the
parentheses of the ﬁrst term. As a result, the on axis ﬁeld
behavior up to the focus is dominated by a single term
proportional to the Bessoid integral I, which justiﬁes the
maximum condition (35) discussed above.

Im,Rm and Im,Zm are partial derivatives of the higher-

ten in terms of I0, it can be shown that the points of
stationary phase, the matching of phases and thus the
higher-order coordinates (Rm, Zm) and phases (χm) are
identical with the original ones:

Rm = R , Zm = Z , χm = χ .

IV. THE SPHERE

A. Geometrical optics solution

Consider a plane wave falling on a transparent sphere
in vacuum. Figure 3 illustrates the refraction of a sin-
gle ray in the meridional plane, containing the point of
observation P and the axis. Within the frame of geomet-
rical optics the cuspoid is formed behind the sphere in
analogy to ﬁgure 2.

Let a be the sphere radius and n > 1 its refractive
index.
In contrast to the previous sections, we choose
the origin of the axially symmetric cylindrical coordinate
system (ρ, z) diﬀerently now, namely as the center M of
the sphere. The incident plane wave propagates parallel
to the z-axis. The geometrical optics focus, formed by
the paraxial rays, is located at F

A ray passes the point Q, is ﬁrst refracted at Q1, a sec-
ond time at Q2 and propagates to P . The incident and
transmitted angle, θi and θt, are related by Snell’s law,
sin θi = n sin θt. Writing the position of P
(ρ, z) in
polar coordinates, ρ = l sin θ and z = l cos θ, one can ﬁnd
the following expression, determining the three rays that
arrive at P :

≡

l sin(θ + 2 θi −

2 θt) = a sin θi ,

(44)

where one has to substitute θt = arcsin[(sin θi)/n]. This
is a transcendental cubic-like equation which has three
roots, either all real or one real and two complex conju-

gate. (For n
the 3-ray region does not start until some distance be-
hind the sphere.) We denote them as θi,j(j = 1, 2, 3) and
choose their order consistently with the previous nota-
tions. Therefore, θi,1 is always real and negative, whereas
θi,2 and θi,3 are either real and positive (lit region) with
θi,2 < θi,3 or complex conjugate (geometrical shadow).

When the θi,j are known, we ﬁnd the θt,j from Snell’s

law and the αj and βj from

α = 2 θt −

(47)

The sphere radius a was subtracted from the path con-
tributions to make the eikonal zero in the center M , if
there were no sphere.

Next we calculate the geometrical optics amplitudes
by determining the meridional and sagittal radii of cur-
vature, Rm and Rs, and their changes due to refrac-
tion. Formulas for the refraction on an arbitrary surface
with arbitrary orientation of the main radii exist in the
literature.34,37 A simple derivation for the sphere can be
found in appendix F.
It yields the dependence of the
actual radii of curvature Rm and Rs (right after the re-
fraction) on the initial radii Rm0 and Rs0 (just before the
refraction):

Finally, the geometrical optics solution for the sphere
is given by (20), where the eikonal ψ and divergence J
are given by (47) and (54). The equation determining
the three rays is (44).
In the geometrical shadow the
sum (20) becomes only the term with j = 1.

To incorporate Fresnel transmission coeﬃcients, we as-
sume that the incident light is linearly polarized in x-
direction, i.e., the incident electric ﬁeld vector is

E0 = E0 ex ,

(55)

with ex the unit vector in x-direction and E0 ≡
U0. Since
axial symmetry is broken, we introduce the polar angle ϕ
which is measured from x to y. The point of observation
P
(ρ, ϕ, z) will be reached by three rays (two may
be complex) and their angles θi,j are still determined
by (44), for all three rays lie in the meridional plane,
containing P and the z-axis (ﬁgure 4a). The initial π-
and σ-polarized components depend on ϕ (ﬁgure 4b):

≡

E0,π = E0 cos ϕ ,
E0,σ = E0 sin ϕ .

Here the t12 (r12) are the standard Fresnel transmission

uum, into the medium 2, i.e., the sphere.

The ray ﬁeld behind the sphere is found by the pro-
jection onto the original Cartesian system (x, y, z). We

D. A protocol for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
calculation behind the sphere

For convenience we summarize the sequence of steps
that should be used for the calculation of the ﬁeld behind
a sphere irradiated with linearly polarized light on the
basis of the formulas developed above:

1. Finding the rays: The origin of the coordinate
system is in the center of the sphere. Choose a
point P
(ρ, ϕ, z) behind the sphere and numer-
ically calculate the 3 rays arriving at P . These
rays are characterized by the 3 incident angles θi,j
(j = 1, 2, 3), found numerically from (44), and
numbered according to ﬁgure 2. All other angles
follow from Snell’s law and from (45), respectively.
Outside the cuspoid the rays 2 and 3 are complex.

2. The geometrical optics solution: Compute the ge-
ometrical optics solution for the electric ﬁeld (61),
which is the sum of contributions from three rays.
The eikonals ψj are calculated from (47) with (46).
The geometrical optics amplitudes are given by the
Fresnel transmission components T (m)
(60) and the
generalized divergence factors 1/
Jj (54), which
follow from the radii of curvature (50)–(53) and the
distances sj from the sphere to P (46). The con-
ventions for the complex roots shall correctly add
up all individual caustic phase shifts.
Ignore the
fact that the geometrical ﬁeld diverges near caustic
regions.

p

j

3. Bessoid matching: Starting from the eikonals ψj,
determine the Bessoid coordinates, i.e., ﬁrst Z, and
then R and χ (28). Next, compute and correctly or-
der the points of stationary phase tj (26), most con-
veniently using trigonometric formulas.23 With the
generalized divergences (54) and the Hessians (25)
the Bessoid amplitudes Am, AmR and AmZ can
be computed from (42) for all orders m = 0, 1, 2.
The electric ﬁeld component E(m) associated with
the m-th order results from the Ansatz (40). The
Bessoid-matched ﬁeld E is ﬁnally given by (62). In
the case of a scalar plane wave (or exactly on the
axis) only the order m = 0 contributes. Proceed
accordingly for the magnetic ﬁeld H, employing dif-
ferent transmission coeﬃcients in step 2.

parameters are as in ﬁgure 5 and the cases (a), (b), (c) and
(d) correspond to q = 300, 100, 30 and 10, respectively. In di-
mensional units, for λ = 0.248 µm this corresponds to sphere
radii of a ≈ 12 µm, 4 µm, 1.2 µm and 0.4 µm.

4. The Bessoid integral : The ﬁnal solution (62) con-
tains the Bessoid integral and higher-order Bessoid
integrals as well as their partial derivatives. The
Bessoid integral I(R, Z) can be eﬃciently com-
puted numerically via the diﬀerential equation (12).
The higher-order Bessoid integrals follow from a re-
cursive relation (39).

5. Remarks: The speed limiting bottleneck of this
procedure is the ﬁnding of the rays θi,j in step
1. The numerical evaluation of the Bessoid inte-
gral is very eﬃcient and in all other steps analyti-
cal expressions are applied. When approaching the
caustic (axis, cuspoid), individual quantities — the

combinations remain ﬁnite. In our calculations we
observed perfect numerical stability up to distances
5 times the
from the caustic of the order of 10−
sphere radius, which is more than enough for any
practical purposes.

E. Comparison with the theory of Mie

We presented a general way to match geometrical op-
tics solutions with the Bessoid integrals. It can be ap-
plied to any axially symmetric system with the cuspoid
topology of spherical aberration.

For the sphere we can compare our approximate results
with the theory of Mie.15 A main quantity characterizing
the sphere is the dimensionless Mie parameter q
k a.
Figure 7 compares the intensity on the axis obtained from
the Mie theory with the Bessoid approximation. The
parameters are as in ﬁgure 5 and the Mie parameter is
q = 300, 100, 30 and 10.

Next, we compare the oﬀ-axis electric and magnetic
ﬁeld as well as the z-component of the Poynting vector,
Sz (ﬁgure 8). Right behind the sphere (z = a) the agree-
ment is not perfect (see ﬁgure 7), though all qualitative
features are preserved. Sections at z = 1.02 a already
show good agreement (ﬁgure 8) and for z & 1.05 a the
pictures become visually almost indistinguishable. Dis-
cussing the quality of these results, one has to diﬀerenti-
ate between the accuracy of the method and the inﬂuence
of those factors which can be taken into account, but were
not included into the current consideration.

For the sphere, for all investigated Mie parameters

are about
5 % in those regions where the intensity is not
very small (including the caustic axis and cuspoid). A
detailed analysis indicates that this deviation originates
from several factors:

±

(i) Inﬂuence of the ﬁnite size of the sphere. There exist
diﬀractive contributions from creeping rays38 propagat-
ing along the sphere surface. They can in principle be
accounted for at the expense of the simplicity of the pro-
cedure, essentially by considering the interference of the
Bessoid ﬁeld with these additional rays. This results in
oscillations which can actually be seen in the Mie curve
on the right side of the Bessoid tail in ﬁgures 7a and b.
(ii) Rays entering the sphere undergo multiple inte-
rior reﬂections. Some of them satisfy resonance con-
ditions, accumulate signiﬁcant energy inside the sphere
and refract outside. This produces an additional ﬁeld
behind the sphere, in particular the intensity becomes
non-zero in the regions of geometrical shadow for the
directly transmitted rays used in the Bessoid matching.
Here again, one can (in principle) study such multiply re-
ﬂected rays separately and add them to the Bessoid ﬁeld,
but their contribution to the focusing properties of the
microspheres is of secondary importance.

(iii) Finally, very close to the sphere surface at dis-
tances of the order of a fraction of λ, there exist evanes-
cent contributions, which are taken into account in the
Mie theory, but are obviously absent in the Bessoid
matching procedure.

Thus, the quality of the Bessoid matching in the most
interesting regions near caustic surfaces is quite satis-
factory.
It rectiﬁes the divergences of geometrical op-
tics, which is asymptotically correct for large q in non-
singular regions of space. Clearly, the procedure has to
be extended whenever contributions from rays other than
those 3 used for matching become signiﬁcant.

The ﬁeld distribution behind the sphere has a rich ﬁne
structure (ﬁgure 8) which our geometrical approach helps
to clarify. It is known that the ring-type ﬁeld enhance-
ment corresponds to the cuspoid caustic, having the ap-
proximate radial distance10

Our approach explains the double-peak structure of

along the direction of polarization. It is related to the ax-
ial ﬁeld component Ez and can be understood in terms
of geometrical optics. On the axis, the Ez components
from the rays 1 and 3 point into opposite directions and
cancel, having an eﬀective phase diﬀerence of π. Oﬀ the
axis, ray 1 underwent a caustic phase shift of
π/2 when
crossing the axis, which makes the condition for construc-
ϕ3 = 3 π/2. Then, according to

Double-peak structures have been observed in

semi-
quantitatively explained on the basis of the Mie solution.9
In an actual experiment it may depend on the laser pulse
parameters and the properties of the patterned material,
whether the Poynting vector or the electric ﬁeld is re-
sponsible for the patterning process. For small spheres
this double peak eﬀect can be understood using the near
ﬁeld pattern for a scattering dipole.9,10 The present ex-
planation (for sphere diameters of a few wavelengths and
larger) results in the same orientation of the maxima and
thus these two limiting cases cover almost all range of
sphere sizes. Similar polarization dependence of the ﬁeld
distribution in focal regions can be used to improve the
resolution.41

V. CONCLUSIONS

We described theoretically arbitrary axially symmetric
aberrated focusing and studied light focusing by micro-
spheres as an example. Following the method of uniform
caustic asymptotics,17 we introduced a canonical inte-
gral describing the wave ﬁeld for the given cuspoid ray
topology. This Bessoid integral appears naturally in the
paraxial approximation. In some regions (oﬀ the caustic
or exactly on the axis) it reduces to simple analytical ex-
pressions. In other regions we eﬃciently computed this
highly oscillatory integral via a single ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equation.

For arbitrary axially symmetric focusing, coordinate
and amplitude transformations match the Bessoid wave
ﬁeld and the solution of geometrical optics. The caustic
divergences of the latter are removed thereby. For vecto-
rial problems with angularly dependent ﬁeld components,
higher-order Bessoid integrals are used for the matching
procedure. The formulas signiﬁcantly simplify on and
near the axis. An approximate universal condition for
the diﬀraction focus can be given in terms of phase dif-
ferences. Here, the concept of caustic phase shifts is of
main importance.

The central part of the Bessoid integral is essentially
a Bessel beam26 with a variable cross section due to the
variable angle of the non-paraxial rays. Its local diameter
is always smaller than in the focus of an ideal lens with
the same numerical aperture. Besides, the largest possi-
ble apertures can be physically realized, which is hardly
possible with lenses. All this is achieved at the expense
of longitudinal conﬁnement.

As an example the focusing of a linearly polarized
plane wave by a transparent sphere is studied in de-
tail. We calculate the geometrical optics eikonals and
divergences, incorporate Fresnel transmission coeﬃcients
and perform Bessoid matching. Using the general theory,
simple expressions for the light ﬁeld on the axis and for

12

the diﬀraction focus are derived. The two strong maxima
in the intensity observed immediately behind the sphere
can be explained as well.

Finally, the results of the Bessoid matching procedure
are compared with the Mie theory. The agreement is
good for Mie parameters k a > 30. Near the sphere the
correspondence is worse due to unaccounted evanescent
contributions.

The developed formulas can be directly applied in
other areas of physics where non-paraxial axially sym-
metric focusing is of importance, e.g., acoustics, semi-
classical quantum mechanics,42 ﬂat superlenses based on
left-handed materials,43 radio wave propagation, scatter-
ing theory,21 chiral conical diﬀraction44 etc.

Concluding, let us brieﬂy enumerate several possibili-
ties to extend and reﬁne the developed formalism. Weak
absorption can be incorporated easily, for it just changes
the amplitudes along the rays and the transmission coef-
ﬁcients. Strong absorption additionally modiﬁes Snell’s
law of refraction, still preserving the axial symmetry.
One can consider incoming radially or azimuthally po-
larized beams, which are known to produce better reso-
lution than linear polarization.41 The diﬀraction of light
from regions beyond the sphere radius can be incorpo-
rated by considering the interference of the Bessoid ﬁeld
with creeping rays.38 For other geometries, in particular
ﬁnite apertures with sharp boundaries, edge rays or the
Rubinowitz representation,16 or an approach based on
catastrophe theory45 have to be used. Such corrections
become relevant, for example, for the ray structure and
the ﬁeld distribution immediately behind spheres with a
refractive index n < √2. Finally, one can calculate the
interference of the diﬀracted light with the original in-
cident wave or the interference of the light refracted by
several spheres or arrays of spheres. The latter yields
interesting secondary patterns46 related to the so called
Talbot eﬀect.47

While the coordinates and phases (R, Z, χ) remain
unchanged, the derivation of the higher-order amplitudes
(Am, AmR, AmZ ) requires some insight for m
2. Let
us brieﬂy consider the case m = 2. For the matching
procedure we need the asymptotic behavior of I2 = IRR−
IR/R far from the caustic regions where R
1 and
where it is dominated by the term IRR. Note that for
the matching procedure we need exactly this asymptotic
representation and in the non-caustic regions only. Thus
— although we need the second-order Bessoid integral I2
on and near the axis, where it vanishes — we shall use
its asymptotic stationary phase expressions far from the
axis for the derivation of the amplitudes. In this region
it is equivalent to the asymptotic of IRR.

FIG. 11: Meridional cross section for the determination of the
sagittal radius of curvature, Rs

The initial radius of curvature is Rm0 ≡

GE, the one
after refraction is Rm ≡
ED. The inﬁnitesimally neigh-
bored beam (γ
1) which is refracted in E′ (the angles
of incidence and transmission in E are θi and θt, in E′
they be denoted θ′i and θ′t) also propagates to D. The
normals onto Rm0 through E and onto Rm through E′
are g and d, respectively.
In the necessary order the
length of the arc EE′ can be approximated by the dis-
EE′. As all angles are small: g = γ Rm0,
tance e
d = δ Rm, and e = ǫ a. On the other hand, we ﬁnd from
the inﬁnitesimal triangles: g = e cos θi, d = e cos θt. This
leads to

≈

Rm =

γ Rm0 cos θt
δ cos θi

(F1)

where we have introduced a minus sign because the wave
is converging after the refraction. The remaining problem
is the angle δ in the denominator. To ﬁnd δ we write the
relations between angles and primed angles:

θ′i = θi + γ + ǫ ,

θ′t = θt −

δ + ǫ .

We express δ from (F2), substitute it into (F1) and ﬁnally
obtain the meridional radius of curvature (48)

For the sagittal radius of curvature we consider ﬁgure

A ray which emerged from G is refracted in E (incident
angle θi and transmitted angle θt). The distance from E
to the intersection H of the ray with the line passing
through G and the sphere center M is the sagittal radius
of curvature, as a neighbored ray, emerging from G and
hitting the sphere not in E but inﬁnitesimally shifted
perpendicular to the meridional plane, will also propa-
gate to H due to symmetry around the line GM . We
have Rs0 ≡

28 In the present work all plots of the Bessoid integral (and its
derivatives) contain 101×101 mesh points, computed with
the software package Mathematica 5 (Wolfram Research).
Direct numerical integration of (2) takes more than one
hour on a modern personal computer. Integration along a
line in the complex plane decreases the amount of time by
approximately a factor of 3. Solving the ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equation (12), however, lasts only a few seconds.

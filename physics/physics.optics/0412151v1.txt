We suggest a novel concept in the soliton switching based on the Bloch-wave
ﬁltering in periodic photonic structures. Taking a binary waveguide array
as an example, we demonstrate that spatial solitons that belong to diﬀerent
spectral band gaps can be selectively reﬂected from or transmitted through an
engineered defect, which acts as a low or high-pass ﬁlter for Bloch waves.

The study of nonlinear light propagation in periodic
photonic structures recently attracted strong interest be-
cause it presents the unique possibility of observing ex-
perimentally an interplay between the eﬀects of nonlin-
earity and periodicity1. Fabricated nonlinear periodic
structures such as arrays of coupled nonlinear optical
waveguides can simultaneously support distinctive types
of self-trapped optical beams in the form of discrete and
gap spatial optical solitons2.

Discrete solitons in a self-focusing nonlinear medium
are localized due to the eﬀect of total internal reﬂection,
which allows to trap an optical beam in a few neighboring
waveguides suppressing diﬀraction-induced light spread-
ing3,4. Spatial gap solitons can also exist in the same
periodic structures, and they appear due to the Bragg
scattering experienced by waves incident on a periodic
lattice at a particular angle5,6.

Many schemes of all-optical soliton switching suggested
so far are based on the use of the speciﬁc properties of
discrete solitons1,7. Here, we suggest a novel approach
which allows one to switch selectively solitons from dif-
ferent gaps. Our idea is related to a more general concept
of Bloch-wave ﬁltering, and it is based on the observation
that a structural defect introduced into a periodic pho-
tonic lattice can be designed in such a way that it would
allow transmission of Bloch waves from some bands si-
multaneously reﬂecting all waves that belong to other
bands. As a result, the gap solitons associated with those
spectral bands may also be transmitted or reﬂected selec-
tively. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the concept of
the Bloch-wave ﬁltering can be realized very eﬀectively
in a binary array of weakly coupled optical waveguides
recently demonstrated and studied experimentally8.

We consider spatial solitons in nonlinear periodic struc-
tures such as waveguide arrays and one-dimensional pho-
tonic lattices.
In general, propagation of light in such
systems can be described by a parabolic wave equation

ψκ,n(x + d). Real wave-numbers κ describe propagat-
ing Bloch waves, which dispersion curves βκ,n(κ) form
distinct bands with the indices n = 1, 2, . . .. Nonlinear
dynamics of slowly modulated Bloch waves of the form
E(x, z) = A(x, z)Eκ,n(x, z), can be described by an ef-
fective nonlinear Sch¨odinger equation9 for the complex

Nonlinear self-action can suppress diﬀraction-induced
beam spreading leading to the formation of a lattice soli-
ton when Dκ,nγκ,n > 0. Such soliton has the form A =
A0sech[(x − Vκ,nz)/x0] exp(iρz), where A0 = p2ρ/γκ,n
and x0 = pDκ,n/ρ. Most remarkably, solitons may
occur in both self-focusing (γ > 0) and self-defocusing
(γ < 0) nonlinear media since Bloch waves can exhibit ei-
ther normal (Dκ,n > 0) or anomalous (Dκ,n < 0) diﬀrac-
tion in each of the bands. Therefore, a nonlinear periodic
structure can support simultaneously diﬀerent types of
solitons associated with various bands10.

To be speciﬁc, we consider the case of self-focusing
Kerr-type nonlinearity [F (x, I) = I] in binary waveguide
arrays, corresponding to the AlGaAS superlattices where
the formation of two types of optical solitons has recently

been observed experimentally8. The refractive index pro-
ﬁle of the optical superlattice is shown in Fig. 1(a), and
other paremeters are n0 = 3.3947 and λ = 1.5 µm. Soli-
tons appear in the spectral regions with normal diﬀrac-
tion, and at larger intensities their propagation constants
are increased and moved into the gaps, as illustrated by
arrows in Fig. 1(b). Solitons associated with the ﬁrst
and second bands are mainly conﬁned at wide and nar-
row waveguides, respectively [see Figs. 1(c,d)], reﬂecting
the structure of corresponding Bloch waves.

We now study the wave transmission through a defect
created in a waveguide array. The soliton-defect scatter-
ing in a homogeneous waveguide array has been studied
experimentally in Ref.7, but here we are interested in
multi-gap eﬀects and take the case of a binary waveguide
array as the simplest example of such a system.

If a wave with a particular wave-number κ(β) is inci-
dent on a defect from the left, then the ﬁeld structure
can be represented as a superposition of Bloch waves,

E = aiEκ,n(x, z) + arE−κ,n(x, z), x < xd−,

(2)

E = atEκ,n(x, z), x > xd+,

where ai, ar, and at are the amplitudes of the inci-
dent, reﬂected, and transmitted waves, respectively, and
xd− < x < xd+ is the defect extension. The key idea of
our approach is to design a defect which reﬂects strongly
the waves belonging to one band, but transmits almost
completely the waves belonging to another band. For
the binary superlattice, we ﬁnd that such Bloch-wave

ﬁltering can be realized by increasing the width of a
single narrow or wide waveguide, as shown in Fig. 2(a)
and Fig. 3(a). We plot the corresponding dependencies
of the reﬂection coeﬃcients |ar/ai|2 on the propagation
constant β for diﬀerent defect widths in Fig. 2(b) and
Fig. 3(b). When the width of originally narrow [Fig. 2]
or wide [Fig. 3] waveguide is increased to a particu-
lar value, the propagation constants of the second-order
mode of the defect waveguide and fundamental modes
of neighboring waveguides almost coincide, allowing for
an eﬃcient ﬁeld tunneling between the waveguides. Si-
multaneously, the tunneling is suppressed between the
next-neighbor waveguides which have diﬀerent propaga-
tion constants. Since Bloch waves are mainly conﬁned
at wide and narrow waveguides in the ﬁrst and second
bands, their resonant transmission can be supported by
a defect embedded between the wide [Fig. 2] or narrow
[Fig. 3] waveguides, respectively, whereas waves are fully
reﬂected in the complimentary gaps.

As discussed above, in a self-focusing medium the soli-
ton wavenumbers are located in the upper sections of the
bands, but can also be shifted inside the gap. Therefore,

and band-2 solitons is readily accessible experimentally
(see Ref.8 and references therein). We have veriﬁed that
the solitons are always reﬂected from a defect which in-
hibits transmission of the corresponding Bloch waves, see
examples in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 3(d). On the other hand,
solitons from the complimentary bands are transmitted
through the defect with a minimal amount of radiation
if their velocities exceed critical values, see Fig. 2(d) and
Fig. 3(c). Strongly localized solitons traveling at slow ve-
locities may however be reﬂected back, due to substantial
modiﬁcation of defect response through nonlinear self-
action. This behavior is consistent with general features
of soliton-defect interactions.

In conclusion, we have suggested a novel approach to
the soliton switching in periodic photonic structures and
demonstrated a simple design of highly eﬃcient Bloch ﬁl-
ters for the example of a binary optical superlattice. The
concept of Bloch-wave ﬁltering is rather general, and it
can be applied to various types of periodic structures
such as optically-induced nonlinear lattices and photonic
crystals. Application of this concept to two-dimensional
discrete networks will allow to greatly enhance their po-
tential for all-optical signal manipulation.

to realize eﬃcient soliton transmission through a defect,
it is necessary to reduce reﬂection not only inside a band,
but also in the gap outside the band. Bloch wave proﬁles
in the gap represent the tails of solitons and decay inside
the structure. For such evanescent waves the reﬂection
coeﬃcients may be larger than unity, and even attain in-
ﬁnite values. The latter case corresponds to the existence
of localized modes supported by the defect, i.e. solutions
with ai = 0 and ar, at 6= 0. Resonant coupling between
the soliton and linear defect modes can result in power
transfer to the localized state. Optimal soliton transmis-
sion can be achieved when such resonances are avoided,
i.e. when the reﬂection coeﬃcient in the vicinity of the
upper band edge is close to zero. This is realized for de-
fect widths corresponding to solid curves in Fig. 2(b) and
Fig. 3(b). Additionally, we have veriﬁed that the phase of
the transmitted waves is almost constant throughout the
band, minimizing distortions to the transmitted soliton
proﬁles due to spatial group-velocity dispersion.

Our numerical simulations of Eq. (1) conﬁrm that the
designed Bloch-wave ﬁlters can switch solitons very ef-
ﬁciently. As initial conditions, we have used solutions
for stationary solitons, and induced their motion across
the lattice by inclining the phase front in the transverse
direction. We note that controlled generation of band-1

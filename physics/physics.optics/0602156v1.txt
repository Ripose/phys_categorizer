While the alignment and rotation of microparticles in optical traps has received increased attention
recently, one of the earliest examples has been almost totally neglected—the alignment of particles
relative to the beam axis, as opposed to about the beam axis. However, since the alignment torques
determine how particles align in a trap, they are directly relevant to practical applications. Lysozyme
crystals are an ideal model system to study factors determining the orientation of nonspherical
birefringent particles in a trap. Both their size and their aspect ratio can be controlled by the growth
parameters, and their regular shape makes computational modelling feasible. We show that both
external (shape) and internal (birefringence) anisotropy contribute to the alignment torque. Three-
dimensionally trapped elongated objects either align with their long axis parallel or perpendicular
to the beam axis depending on their size. The shape-dependent torque can exceed the torque due to
birefringence, and can align negative uniaxial particles with their optic axis parallel to the electric
ﬁeld, allowing application of optical torque about the beam axis.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Optical tweezers have been used to manipulate and
investigate microscopic particles for many years, and a
wide variety of applications have been explored. The un-
derlying principle behind optical tweezers is the transfer
of momentum from the trapping beam to the particle [1].
As light can carry angular momentum as well as linear
momentum, torque can also be exerted on particles in
optical tweezers.

The optical torque acting about the beam axis is
always a result of the alteration of orbital and/or
spin angular momentum of the incident beam by the
trapped particle, by absorption or by scattering if there
is either external (shape) or internal (birefringence)
anisotropy [2]. Consequently, the torque can either orig-
inate from a beam where the incident light itself carries
angular momentum that is transferred to the particle,
or it can originate from a beam where the incident light
carries zero angular momentum, but where the trapped
particle induces angular momentum in the beam.

A variety of methods to accomplish angular momen-
tum transfer have been proposed and tested [3, 4, 5].
Of these, one of the best suited for actual practical ap-
plications is the transfer of incident spin angular mo-

mentum to birefringent particles [6, 7, 8]. Firstly, spin
angular momentum can easily be measured, so that the
applied optical torque can be determined by purely op-
tical means, making the system well suited for quanti-
tative measurements [7, 9]. Secondly, the torque can
be controlled by changing the polarization state of the
light, keeping the power constant. Thirdly, the torque
is quite high, typically on the order of ¯h per photon per
second if highly birefringent particles are used. Finally,
this method can be used with Gaussian beams, ensuring
high 3D trapping eﬃciency.

However, in order to act as a wave plate, the bire-
fringent particle cannot be oriented with the optic axis
parallel to the beam axis. Only for other orientations is
the polarization state of the light altered and spin angu-
lar momentum transferred from the beam to the particle,
causing either constant particle rotation in circularly po-
larized light or particle alignment in linearly polarized
light. Obviously, maintaining the required orientation is
crucial for the use of birefringent particles as micromo-
tors or for other applications requiring rotation.

Similar principles apply to ﬂattened or elongated par-
ticles which also can alter the angular momentum of the
incident light only if their asymmetry about the beam
axis is conserved after being trapped. Orientation eﬀects
due to the shape of the particle have been reported pre-
viously. In particular, it has long been known that elon-
gated particles tend to align with their long axis along the
axis of the trapping beam [10]. However, this behaviour
is not universal, and the orientation of trapped particles
depends on their size, shape, and optical properties [11].
The torques giving rise to the orientation of particles

with respect to the beam axis have received little at-
tention; this is due in part to the transient nature of the
torques, which act to align the particle when it is trapped,
and also to the diﬃculty of calculating torques on non-
spherical particles. Earlier work has usually made use
of the geometric optics approximation [12], or been re-
stricted to particles of simple geometry and homogeneous
and isotropic material [13]. Extension of these founda-
tions to smaller particles for which geometric optics fails,
and to more complex particles is highly desirable.

Here we will present numerical

calculations—
substantiated by experimental results—on how birefrin-
gent particles with diﬀerent aspect ratios and radii will
align after being three-dimensionally trapped. Moreover,
we are completing the picture of shape-dependent align-
ment of particles, showing that elongated particles can
align with their long axis either parallel or perpendicular
to the beam axis, depending on their aspect ratio and
size compared to the beam waist.

However, the internal anisotropy (birefringence) also
contributes to the torque that determines orientation rel-
ative to the beam axis. This torque—like the one due to
the shape—only occurs at the beginning of a trapping
event and has also not yet been studied in detail. Our
results reveal that the birefringence-induced torque re-
sponsible for alignment to the beam axis has the same
order of magnitude as the birefringence-induced torque
about the beam axis. This is in contrast to the shape-
induced torque which can be an order of magnitude larger
relative to the beam axis as compared to the one about
the beam axis [13].

We show both experimentally and by computational
modelling that, depending on the respective anisotropy,
one aligning eﬀect can dominate the other. Using grow-
ing lysozyme crystals we were able to observe the tran-
sition where the alignment torque due to birefringence
overcomes the torque due to shape when we changed the
aspect ratio of a particle while trapped. These ﬁndings
explain how negative uniaxial calcite crystals can be spun
in circularly polarized light [6], despite the fact that such
crystals tend to align with their optic axis parallel to the
beam axis [8].

II. ORIENTATION OF LYSOZYME CRYSTALS

Lysozyme crystals are a widely used model to study

common (tetragonal) form,
lysozyme forms a positive
uniaxial birefringent crystal, with a well-characterized
morphology. A schematic drawing showing the crystal-
lographic axes and faces can be found in reference [14].
The optic axis, which coincides with the crystal’s c-axis,
points from one tip to the other tip of the crystal. The
diﬀerence in the indices along the [001] and [110] axes at
1064 nm is 1.66 × 10−3 [15]. The relative ordinary refrac-
tive index (m = ncrystal/nmedium) was found to be 1.039
from the measured trap stiﬀness [16]. The aspect ratio

2

is deﬁned as the length along the optic axis to the width
of the [110] face.

The size and shape distributions of lysozyme crystals
can be controlled by varying the initial salt and protein
concentrations. This allows the experimental study of the
shape-dependence of the orientation of optically trapped
particles. The size and aspect ratio can even be changed
dynamically, while the lysozyme crystal is held in the
optical trap.

The experiments were carried out using a setup de-
scribed in detail by Singer et al. [15]. Brieﬂy, linearly
polarized light from an Yb-doped ﬁber laser operating at
1070 nm in the range of 200–500 mW was coupled into
a 60× oil-immersion objective of numerical aperture 1.4,
with a resulting beam waist radius of 0.44 µm. A half-
wave plate in the beam path could be used to adjust
the direction of the plane of polarization of the trapping
beam. The exact alignment of the individual particles in
the trap could be determined using a software package
developed by Gibson and Kou [17].

We calculated the optical force and torque acting on
lysozyme crystals in an optical trap by using the T -
matrix method to determine the scattering of the trap-
ping beam by the crystal, and ﬁnding the diﬀerence be-
tween the inﬂow and outﬂow of electromagnetic momen-
tum and angular momentum, which is equal to the force
and torque exerted on the crystal [5, 18, 19, 20].

Since calculation of the T -matrix is much faster for
axisymmetric particles [21], the lysozyme crystals were
modelled as cone-tipped cylinders. Since their relative
refractive index is close to 1, and their birefringence is
small, even compared with this small refractive index
contrast, it was possible to assume an eﬀective isotropic
refractive index (which is a function of the orientation
of the crystal) to separately calculate the torque due to
the shape. The torque due to the birefringence was then
calculated using the angle-dependence of the orientation
energy of the birefringent material in the applied ﬁeld;
this procedure, while approximate, is valid in the low-
contrast low-birefringence case of lysozyme crystals.

Equilibrium orientations were found from the depen-
dence of torque on the angle between the axis of the crys-
tal model and the beam axis. The torque versus angle
for diﬀerent aspect ratios is shown in ﬁgure 1. Three
distinct regimes of behaviour—alignment with the crys-
tal optic axis perpendicular to the beam axis, parallel
to the beam axis, and at an intermediate angle—can be
identiﬁed. This behaviour can be understood in terms of
the usual behaviour of nonspherical particles in optical
traps—such particles tend to align with their longest di-
mension along the beam axis. Therefore, a high-aspect
ratio lysozyme crystal (elongated along the optic axis)
will align with the optic axis parallel to the beam axis.
For crystals with smaller aspect ratios the body diagonal
is the longest axis and alignment with the body diagonal
parallel to the beam axis is to be expected, leading to the
optic axis being skewed to the beam axis by an angle de-
pending on the aspect ratio [14]. This type of alignment

FIG. 1: Torque (shown as torque eﬃciency, in ¯h/photon) acting on trapped lysozyme crystals. Solid lines show the total torque,
dot–dash lines the torque due to shape alone, and dashed lines the torque due to birefringence alone. The dotted line indicates
zero torque; equilibrium points occur when the total torque curve (solid line) crossed this dotted line, with the stable equilibria
indicated by the small circles. In all cases, since the crystals are positive uniaxial, the torque acts to align the optic axis (the
symmetry axis of the model crystals) with the electric ﬁeld. (a)–(c) show the dependence of the torque on the angle between
the optic axis of the crystal and the beam axis. A positive torque acts to align the optic axis with the beam axis. The torque is
shown for crystals of radius 3 µm and aspect ratios of (a) 0.9, (b) 1.2, and (c) 1.6. Three diﬀerent equilibrium orientations can
be seen: optic axis perpendicular to the beam axis (a), with both the torque due to birefringence and the torque due to shape
acting in the same direction; parallel to the beam axis (c), with the two contributions to the torque opposing each other, but
with the shape contribution dominant; and at an intermediate angle (b). In (b), if the shape torque was the only torque acting,
the crystal would still align at an intermediate angle. The birefringence torque still acts to align the optic axis perpendicular to
the beam axis and shifts the equilibrium angle closer to being perpendicular to the beam axis, but is insuﬃcient to overcome
the shape torque. The torque about the beam axis acting on the crystal in (a) is shown in (d). A positive torque acts to align
the optic axis with the plane of polarisation; the angle is the angle between the optic axis and the plane of polarisation. The
shape torque and birefringence torques oppose each other. In this case, the shape torque is dominant; for larger crystals, the
birefringence torque will increase approximately proportional to the radius, while the shape torque will decrease [5]

is widely observed with ﬂattened particles [13]. Mean-
while, since the crystals are positive uniaxial, the torque
due to birefringence acts to align the optic axis perpen-
dicular to the beam axis. For low aspect ratio (ﬂattened)
particles, both the torque due to shape and the torque
due to birefringence act in the same direction, and the
crystal aligns with the optic axis perpendicular to the
beam axis, as seen in ﬁgure 1(a). For elongated crystals,

these torques oppose each other, and the transition to
alignment along the beam axis requires a larger aspect
ratio than would be the case without birefringence.

However, this simple picture fails to explain the ex-
istence of the third regime—alignment with the optic
axis perpendicular to the beam axis. Notably, the shape
torque alone would result in alignment at an interme-
diate angle, at an angle of 17◦. Since the birefringence

We observed all three types of alignment with lysozyme
crystals of varying size and aspect ratio. Since it is possi-
ble to grow crystals while they are trapped, we were able
to observe the transitions between these regimes of align-
ment in individual crystals. Figure 2 shows the growth
of a trapped crystal while the protein concentration in
the solution was changed, with a change in orientation
between frames 2 and 3.
It can be seen that for the
given growing conditions the crystal is growing primar-
ily by addition of material on the (110) faces, as would
be expected at a high protein concentration [22]. The
measured angle between the optic axis of the crystal and
the beam axis is shown in ﬁgure 3. The transition to the
perpendicular alignment occurs when the torque due to
the birefringence of the crystal becomes dominant over
the shape-dependent torque. However, even if the crys-
tals were optically isotropic, this transition would still
occur (though at a smaller aspect ratio) when the shape-
dependent torque changes direction.

The observed equilibrium orientations of a number of
lysozyme crystals of varying size and aspect ratio are
shown in ﬁgure 4. The calculated extents of the diﬀerent
regimes of orientation are also shown, and agree well with
the observed orientations. The crystals were all in the
same sample. Note that the crystals drawn in ﬁgure 4

III. OTHER PARTICLES

While the previous

results apply speciﬁcally to
lysozyme crystals, which have a low refractive index con-
trast with the medium and a small birefringence, the
same general principles apply to other particles as well.
While the shape-dependent torque varies with the refrac-
tive index of the particle (proportional to the refractive
index contrast m− 1 in the low-contrast limit), the orien-
tations for which the torque is zero only weakly depends
on the refractive index—a refractive index contrast ten
times larger yields boundaries between the regimes of ori-
entation very similar to those in ﬁgure 4.

This is especially relevant when we consider the trap-
ping and rotation about the beam axis of birefrin-
gent particles.
If the particle is positive uniaxial, the
birefringence-dependent torque acts to align the optic
axis perpendicular to the beam axis. The torque on a
negative uniaxial particle, on the other hand, acts to align
the optic axis with the beam axis. If this is the equilib-
rium orientation of the particle, the particle appears to
be isotropic as far as the incident beam is concerned,
and no transfer of angular momentum occurs [2, 8]. This

5

raises the question of why optically trapped negative uni-
axial crystals have been observed to spin [6]. It appears
reasonable to suppose that, especially since the crystals
in question were irregular, shape-dependent torques pro-
duced an equilibrium orientation such that the optic axis
was not parallel to the beam axis.

It can also be seen in ﬁgure 4 that, if the particle
is small compared to the beam waist, elongated parti-
cles can align with their long axis perpendicular to the
beam axis, in agreement with previous results for very
small particles [11]. These ﬁndings can be explained by
the fact that particles that are small compared to the
beam waist are trapped in the centre of the focal spot,
where the intensity gradient is small. The elongated ob-
jects therefore align with the axis of the highest particle
polarisability—their longest axis—in the direction of the
electric ﬁeld vector, and therefore perpendicular to the
beam axis, rather than parallel to the beam axis.

birefringent particles [7, 8, 9]. However, the ability to
use birefringent particles is restricted to those which ori-
ent with their optic axis not parallel to the beam axis
after being trapped, which at ﬁrst appears to rule out
the use of negative uniaxial materials. We have shown
that the torque due to nonspherical shape can overcome
the torque due to birefringence, and can be used to main-
tain negative uniaxial particles in the desired orientation.
Furthermore, we showed that elongated particles small
compared to the beam waist will align perpendicular to
the beam axis.

The results presented are relevant to the design of par-
ticles that can be used as motors in optically-driven mi-
cromachines, and have potential to increase the range of
particles that can serve to probe properties of microscopic
or biological systems. The predictability and computabil-
ity of these torques enables their practical use in optical
micromanipulation.

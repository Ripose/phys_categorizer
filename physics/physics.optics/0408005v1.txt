The Lorentz transformations for the optical constants
(electric permittivity, magnetic permeability and index of re-
fraction) of moving media are considered.

PACS: 78.20.Ci, 42.50.Lc, 42.50.Nn

1. Introduction
Some novel vacuum eﬀects associated with the dynam-
ical quantities (such as energy, spin and momentum) of
zero-point ﬂuctuation ﬁelds have been considered in the
literature. These eﬀects include the Casimir eﬀect (re-
lated to the vacuum energy and mode distribution struc-
ture) [1,2], magnetoelectric birefringences of the quantum
vacuum [3], vacuum-induced Berry’s phase of spinning
particles (related to the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuation) [4]
and quantum-vacuum geometric phase of zero-point ﬁeld
in a coiled ﬁber system (related to the spin of vacuum)
[5,6].

As to the eﬀect associated with the momentum of
vacuum zero-point ﬁelds, more recently, Feigel has con-
sidered the quantum vacuum contribution to the mo-
mentum of electromagnetic media [7]. We think that
the relativistic transformations for the optical constants
(electric permittivity and magnetic permeability) of the
medium should be taken into account when writing the
Lagrangian of the moving electromagnetic system. It can
be shown that the eﬀect arising from such a transforma-
tion will also provide a quantum vacuum contribution
to the velocity of media, in addition to the one derived
by Feigel himself [7]. This Note presents the relativistic
transformations for the optical constants of moving me-
dia.

2. The relativistic transformations for magnetic
permeability and electric permittivity

The transformations of E, B, H and D Assume that
an inertial frame of reference moves at velocity v relative
to a rest system in which an electromagnetic medium
(homogeneous and isotropic) is ﬁxed. In the following,
all the physical quantities with a prime refer to those in
the moving frame while the ones without a prime refer
to the quantities in the rest frame. According to SR, the
relativistic transformation for the electric ﬁeld strength

E and the magnetic induction B is of the form

Here, for convenience and simplicity, we consider a time-
harmonic electromagnetic wave propagating along the
relative velocity v between the two inertial frames. The
wave vector of such a wave is pointed opposite to the
direction of v. So, the set of vectors (v, H, E) form a
right-handed system. In this sense, the direction of the
E in (5) is parallel to that of H. If v, H, E are
term
the magnitudes of v, H, E, respectively, then the magni-
E is ǫvE. Thus we have the

under the Lorentz transformation.

The trivial cases It follows from Eqs. (9) and (16) that
when the relative velocity v between the two frames van-
ishes, the permeability and permittivity

µ′r = µr,

ǫ′r = ǫr.

(17)

It is a trivial case deserving no consideration. In addition,
for a vacuum medium in which the relative permeability
and permittivity equal the unity, i.e., µr = ǫr = 1, Eqs.
(9) and (16) give

µ′r = 1,

ǫ′r = 1.

(18)

This means that both the permeability and the permit-
tivity of the vacuum medium are invariant under the
Lorentz transformation (which is in connection with the
principle of invariance of light speed). In this sense, vac-
uum can be considered a Lorentz-invariance medium, all
the optical constants of which measured by diﬀerent ob-
servers who move at relative velocities with respect to
each other are correspondingly the same.

Optical refractive index The optical refractive index of
the medium observed from the moving frame and the
ǫ′rµ′r and n = √ǫrµr,
rest frame are expressed by n′ =
respectively. According to Eqs. (9) and (16), the Lorentz
transformation for the optical refractive index is

Fizeau’s experiment The phase velocity of a light in a
moving medium (or seen from a moving frame) is de-
ﬁned as u′p = c

u′p =

It was shown in Fizeau’s experiment that the speed of

Fizeau’s experimental result is just an eﬀect of the rela-
tivistic transformation of the optical refractive index of
the moving medium.

velocity of light also agrees with the traditional superpo-
sition principle of velocity in SR.

(22)

The Lorentz invariance of characteristic impedance of
media It follows from the expressions (8) and (15) that

µ′
ǫ′ =

ǫ . This, therefore, implies that the character-

istic impedance of the medium is a Lorentz scalar, and
that the ratio of E to H for a time-harmonic wave is an
invariant.

4. Doppler’s eﬀect in a moving medium

Suppose we have a regular anisotropic medium with
the rest refractive index tensor ˆn, which is moving rela-
tive to an inertial frame K with speed v in the arbitrary
directions. The rest refractive index tensor ˆn can be writ-
ten as ˆn = diag [n1, n2, n3] with ni > 0, i = 1, 2, 3. The
wave vector of the electromagnetic wave under consider-
ation and the relative velocity v between the two frames
are chosen to be antiparallel (seen from the inertial frame
K). Thus the wave vector of a propagating wave with the
ω
frequency ω reads k =
c (n1, n2, n3) measured by the
observer ﬁxed at this medium. In this sense, one can de-
ﬁne a 3-D vector n = (n1, n2, n3), and the wave vector
k may be rewritten as k =
c . Now we analyze the
x of the above time-harmonic electromag-
phase ωt
netic wave under the following Lorentz transformation

To gain some insight into the meanings of the expres-
sion (25), let us consider the special case of a boost (of
the Lorentz transformation (23)) in the ˆx1-direction, in
which the medium velocity relative to K along the posi-
tive ˆx1-direction is v. In the meanwhile, we assume that
the wave vector of the electromagnetic wave is also par-
allel to the negative ˆx1-direction. The modulus of wave
vector seen from K is

If the rest refractive index of the medium in the ˆx1-

which is a relativistic formula for the addition of “refrac-
tive indices” ( v

Obviously, Eq. (27) is in agreement with Eq. (19).

For the vacuum medium (n = 1), Eq. (28) is reduced to

which is an expression for the longitudinal Doppler’s ef-
fect.

Recently, a kind of artiﬁcial media called left-handed
materials which possess a negative index of refraction
attract attention of many investigators [8]. Consider a
left-handed medium, the index of refraction of which is
c
c+v ω. Com-
n =

pared with (29), the eﬀect here is shown to be the reversal
of Doppler’s shift. Similarly, the reversal of Cerenkov ra-
diation will also arise in such a negative refractive index
material.

Abstract

We extend a modal theory of diﬀraction by a set of parallel ﬁbers to deal
with the case of a hard boundary: that is a structure made for instance of
air-holes inside a dielectric matrix. Numerical examples are given concerning
some resonant phenomena.

I. INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals (PCs) are periodically modulated structures that present the properties
of having photonic band gaps [1–3]. In the case of 2D photonic crystal where it is possible
to study separately s- and p-polarized ﬁelds, it is now known that large gaps are easier to
obtain with inverted-contrast crystals (i.e. air holes in a dielectric matrix) with p-polarized
ﬁelds than with s-polarized ﬁelds [4,5]. In this work we extend a multi-scattering theory by
cylinders [4,6–9] in order to deal with inverted-contrast crystals with a hard boundary, that
is a structure made of dielectric or metallic inclusions in a dielectric matrix embedded in
vacuum (ﬁg. 1). This theory allows to quantify the importance of the hard boundary when
the device is considered as a 2D PC and also to study the propagation phenomena when the
device modelizes a photonic crystal ﬁber [10–13].

II. THEORY OF DIFFRACTION

We start by constructing the generalized scattering matrix of a set of N dielectric or
metallic rods embedded in a dielectric cylinder of circular cross section Ω (ﬁg.1) and ra-
dius R. We use a Cartesian coordinate system (O; x, y, z) with origin at the center of Ω.
The electromagnetic ﬁelds considered here are harmonic ﬁelds with a time dependence of
exp(

iωt).

−
The rods are denoted by

{

Dn}

, they are ﬁlled with a dielectric (relative permittivity εn)
or metallic material. The cylinder in which the ﬁbers are contained has relative permittivity
εr, ﬁnally this cylinder is embedded in vacuum. Due to the invariance of the medium along
the z-direction we look for solutions of Maxwell equations with a z dependence of exp (iγz).
Under this assumption, it is easily shown that all the components of both magnetic and
electric ﬁelds are known once Ez and Hz are known. Denoting

the exterior problem requires a larger number of coeﬃcient nc.

In the case of a diﬀraction problem,

Fi,+ represents the incident ﬁeld illuminating the
structure such as a plane wave, a gaussian beam or a cylindrical wave. The plane wave
deﬁned by the trihedron (Ei, Hi, k0) is spatially characterized by its Euler angles (ϕ0, θ0, δ0)
where ϕ0, θ0 and δ0 are respectively called precession, conicity and polarization angle, see
ﬁg. 2. Therefore, the Cartesian coordinates of k0 are given by:

b

k0 sin θ0 cos ϕ0
k0 sin θ0 sin ϕ0
k0 cos θ0
In this formalism, the case of s (resp. p) polarization is deﬁned by the parameters θ0 = 90 ◦
and δ0 = 90 ◦ (resp. δ0 = 0 ◦). This corresponds to the cases where the unique non zero
component of the electric ﬁeld (resp magnetic ﬁeld) is Ez (resp. Hz).

III. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE

We consider a hexagonal photonic crystal constituted by 19 air holes embedded in a
dielectric circular cylinder of optical index √εr = 4, see ﬁg. 3. The radii of the holes and
of the cylinder core are respectively equal to rf = 0.8 and R = 10. The two-dimensional
structure is illuminated by a plane wave in p-polarization. The transmission coeﬃcient T is
deﬁned as the ﬂux of the Poynting vector of the total ﬁeld collected on a segment situated
below the cylinder sheath and normalized to the incident energy, see ﬁg 3. The convergence
of the vector multi-scattering method is studied with respect to the numbers nf and nc
of Fourier coeﬃcients respectively used for the series expansion of the interior (ﬁbers) and
exterior (cylinder sheath) problems. Figure 4 presents the relative error of the transmission
T versus nf and nc for an incident plane wave with λ/R = 1.70 i.e. in the resonant domain.
The vector multi-scattering method converges with a relative error less than 0.1% with
nc > 15 and for nf higher than 3. However, independently of nc, the number of Fourier
coeﬃcients nh must be higher than 4 for a correct convergence of the diﬀraction problem.
Therefore, in order to get a good numerical convergence in this wavelength domain, we
choose nc = 20 and nf = 4. In that case, using a Personnal Computer with a 200 MHz
processor and with 64 Mo of RAM, the computation time for the transmission coeﬃcient
for a wavelength and for the structure deﬁned in ﬁg.3 is about 50 seconds. We have also
tested our results against that obtained using the ﬁctitious Sources Method [15,14].

We now study the scattering properties of the PC embedded inside the cylinder sheath

deﬁned in ﬁg.3:
We start with a hexagonal PC constituted by 19 air holes embedded in an inﬁnitely dielectric
medium of optical index √εr = 4 (i.e. without the circular boundary). The PC presents a
photonic band gap for the interval of wavelengths λ/R = [2.0; 2.70] for p-polarization, see
the bold curve of ﬁgure 5. The solid curve represents the transmission T of the PC without
boundary and doped by a central microcavity (the central air hole is removed) computed for
p-polarization (θ0 = 90◦ and δ0 = 0◦). It appears a resonant wavelength λr(90◦)/R = 2.13
inside the photonic band gap associated with a localized mode.
Let us now compare these results with that corresponding to the structure deﬁned in ﬁg.3
(PC with the circular boundary):
Figure 6 gives the transmission diagram versus the wavelength for a p-polarized incident
plane wave. The solid curve represents the transmission in the case where the central air
hole is removed whereas the dashed curve represents the transmission for the perfect crystal
(with the central hole). This structure also presents a photonic band gap for the interval
[2.15; 2.7] but slightly shifted toward higher wavelengths in comparison with the PC without
the circular boundary. We can also remark that though the cylinder sheath is illuminated
in the resonant domain, the photonic band gap phenomenon provokes the extinction of the
electromagnetic modes of the exterior cylinder.
The doped PC embedded inside the cylinder sheath presents a maximum of transmission
r(90◦)/R = 2.20. The map of
inside the photonic band gap domain for the wavelength λc
r(90◦)/R = 2.20
the modulus of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁrms that the resonant wavelength λc
is associated to a localized mode of the structure, see ﬁg.7. In conclusion, the resonant
wavelengths of PCs inside an inﬁnite dielectric medium are shifted toward higher
wavelengths when PCs are embedded inside a cylinder sheath. These results

demonstrate that rigorous numerical computations of ﬁnite-size structures are necessary to
eﬃciently describe diﬀraction properties of PC ﬁbers.

Recent studies have demonstrated that resonant wavelengths associated to localized
modes strongly depend upon the propagation coeﬃcient γ (i.e. upon the conicity angle
θ0 in the case of scattering problems) [4,20]. Numerical and theoretical experiments have
shown that the dependence of the resonant wavelengths with respect of the conicity angle
is given by:

λr(θ0) = λr(90◦) sin θ0

(9)

This behavior can be interpreted thanks to a simple model called ”model of the inﬁnitely
conducting cavity” [19]. Although the localization of light inside PCs doped by microcavities
is a global phenomenon due to the photonic band gap eﬀect and the broken symmetry
of the lattice, both resonant wavelengths and localized modes may be well approximated
using a local representation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Figure 5 presents the diagram of
transmission in the case of the doped PC without boundary for 3 distinct conicity angles 90◦,
80◦, 70◦ and for a ﬁxed polarization angle δ0 = 0◦. The resonant wavelength is shifted toward
the shorter wavelengths inside the band gap when the conicity angle decreases. In table 1,
both numerical computations and predicted resonant wavelengths versus the conicity angle
are compared. The domain of validity of the ”inﬁnitely conducting cavity” model depends
on the strength of the localization of the light with respect to the conicity angle. For example
in our case, decreasing the conicity angle induced the shift of the localized modes toward
the lower edge of the band gap. Therefore the localized mode is delocalized out of the
microcavity hence the model of ”the inﬁnitely conducting cavity” is no more valid. This
behavior explains why equation (9) must be applied for low inclinations of the wave vector
with respect to the plane deﬁned by the cross section of the ﬁbers (i.e. for θ < 60◦). Let
us now study the optical properties of the same PC embedded inside the cylinder sheath
deﬁned in ﬁg.3 versus the conicity angle. Figure 8 presents the diagram of transmission
obtained for 3 values of the conicity angle (90◦, 80◦, 70◦) and for a ﬁxed polarization angle
δ0 = 0◦. These results lead to two remarks:
1) When decreasing the conicity angle, a second resonant wavelength appears,
2) The shift of the resonant wavelength is weaker for a PC ﬁber than for a PC without
boundary.
r(70◦)/R = 2.226 demonstrates that the
The apparition of the second resonant wavelength λc
optical interactions of the PC and the cylinder sheath modify strongly the photonic band
structures. Moreover, the conicity angle dependence of the resonant wavelengths diminishes
when the PC is embedded inside a cylinder sheath. In that case, the model of the ”inﬁnitely
conducting cavity” cannot be used to compute the shift of the resonant wavelengths for
grazing incidence. This behavior may be eﬃciently used for controlling the detunning of the
localized modes with respect to the inclination of the wave vector.

We have extended the vector multi-scattering theory of diﬀraction by parallel cylinders
to the case of a hard boundary. We have applied this theory in order to study the scattering

properties of a PC embedded inside a cylinder sheath. The numerical results have shown
that PC ﬁbers present complicated photonic band structures with additional localized modes
for grazing incidence. The exterior circular boundary also attenuates the detunning of
the resonant wavelengths with respect to the inclination of the wave vector (i.e. with the
propagation coeﬃcient γ). Matters related to the optical eﬀects of the size of the PC inside
the cylinder sheath will be discussed in future studies. This theory allows to study the
transmission properties of 2D PC with inverted contrast but it can also be straightforwardly
applied to the study of propagation phenomena in photonic crystal ﬁbers, where the modes
are linked to the resonances of the scattering matrix [18,19,21] Work is also in progress in
that direction

Observation of coherent population trapping (CPT) at ground-state Zeeman sublevels of Cr3+-ion
in ruby is reported. The experiments are performed at room temperature by using both nanosecond
optical pulses and nanosecond trains of ultrashort pulses. In both cases sharp drops in the resonantly
induced ﬂuorescence are detected as the external magnetic ﬁeld is varied. Theoretical analysis of
CPT in a transient regime due to pulsed action of optical pulses is presented.

In last few decades very much attention has been paid
to studying optical interference phenomena originating
from the atomic coherence excited by laser light while
interacting with multi-level atomic media. These phe-
nomena include coherent population trapping (CPT) [1],
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [2], las-
ing without population inversion (LWI) [3], slow light [4],
and many others. The interest to this ﬁeld arises from
a number of potential applications of these phenomena.
Among them are metrology, quantum information stor-
age and processing, ultra-sensitive magnetometry, devel-
opment of lasers in vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), X-ray,
and γ-ray ranges, etc. However, CPT and related phe-
nomena are mostly being studied in gaseous media while
for practical purposes solid-state materials are preferable.
The advantages of solids are high atomic density, absence
of atomic diﬀusion, compactness, and robustness. At the
same time, decoherence processes in solid media are se-
vere. Nevertheless, several demonstrations of EIT [5, 6],
slow light [5], and non-degenerate four-wave mixing [7] in
solids have been reported by several groups. However, all
those works were performed at temperatures close to the
liquid helium one. This fact, in turn, makes real solid-
state applications of the above phenomena questionable.

In this Letter I report the ﬁrst, to my knowledge,
experimental observation of CPT resonances in crys-
talline solid at room temperature. Prior to that, I have
to discuss some general issues in order to identify the
class of solid-state materials in which the phenomena
I
of EIT/CPT can be observed at room temperature.
will consider only optical crystals doped with either rare-
earth or transition metal ions possessing discrete elec-
tronic states in the bandgap of the host material. The
electronic transitions between those states, both opti-
cal and Zeeman and/or hyperﬁne, can be very narrow
even at room temperature. The class of so-called S-state
ions doped into wide-bandgap optical crystals is of par-
ticular interest. It includes Cr3+, Eu2+, F e3+, M n4+,
Gd3+, and several others. The most important feature
of these ions is that, when incorporated into a crystal,
their ﬁrst excited electronic state lies several thousands
cm−1 above the ground one. Consequently, the strongest

relaxation process between the ground-state Zeeman or
hyperﬁne sublevels, owing to resonant inelastic scattering
of phonons at low-energy electronic transition (Orbach
relaxation, [8]) is suppressed. As a result, the decoher-
ence rate at the transitions between Zeeman/hyperﬁne
sublevels can be as low as a few M Hz even at room
temperature. This fact is conﬁrmed by a vast number
of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements
in which the ions mentioned above serve as paramagnetic
probes. Some of them, namely, Cr3+, Eu2+, and Gd3+,
oﬀer very favorable optical properties as well. In the fol-
lowing discussion, the case of ruby, i.e. Cr3+ : Al2O3, is
considered.

Another important feature of doped solids is that the
population decay from the excited electronic state is
much slower than decoherence at Zeeman/hyperﬁne tran-
sition. This is exactly opposite to the case of alkali-metal
vapors in which most of experimental work on EIT/CPT
is being performed. Therefore, one cannot expect to
populate the coherent superposition of ground-state sub-
levels, which does not interact with the laser ﬁeld under
the conditions of CPT (so-called, “dark” state), by decay
of the excited optical level, as is the case in the alkali-
metal experiments. The only way of exciting ground-
state coherence in that situation is to remove as much
population as possible from the “bright” state (the coher-
ent superposition of sublevels orthogonal to the “dark”
one) by transferring it to the upper optical level. This
should be done faster than the coherence decays, i.e. laser
excitation has to be pulsed.

Let us consider the following theoretical model. A
three-level medium is illuminated with a resonant laser
pulse interacting with both 1 ↔ 3 and 2 ↔ 3 optical

per we will be interested in the amount of population
transferred into level 3 by a laser pulse or pulse train
as a function of the energy separation between ground-
state Zeeman sublevels 1 and 2 which can be varied by
means of external magnetic ﬁeld. The following nota-
tions are introduced: Γ is the homogeneous halfwidth of
optical transitions, γ is the Zeeman decoherence rate, Ω
is the laser ﬁeld time-dependent Rabi frequency (dipole

matrix elements of both optical transitions are assumed
equal). The initial populations of the two ground-state
sublevels are ρ11 = ρ22 = 1/2, ρ33 = 0. Assume also,
that the pulse duration is longer than Γ−1, γ−1. This as-
sumption somewhat contradicts the last statement in the
previous paragraph, but it is relevant under the experi-
mental conditions described below. Algebraically solving
the density matrix equations for all the coherences, one
comes to the following linear equation for the upper state
population:

where P = 2Ω2/Γ and δ is the frequency separation be-
tween the ground-state sublevels. The second term in
brackets represents the eﬀect of Zeeman coherence on
the rate at which level 3 is populated. Laser pulse starts
acting on the medium at t = 0. As t → ∞, all three
levels become equally populated, as expected. However,
if at some instant T the laser pulse is shut oﬀ, the ﬁnal
population of level 3 is smaller for δ = 0 than it is for
δ 6= 0 because of its lower growth rate as illustrated in
Fig.1. The width of this transient CPT resonance is de-
termined by P + γ, i.e. by Zeeman decoherence rate and
power broadening.

Similar eﬀects can be observed under the illumination
of the medium with a short (nanosecond) train of ultra-
short (picosecond) pulses. In addition to CPT resonance
at zero magnetic ﬁeld, one should expect drops in the up-
per state population as the Zeeman sublevel separation
becomes equal to the multiple of the pulse repetition rate
in the train [9]. It worths mentioning that transient co-
herent eﬀects in ruby crystal at room temperature were
ﬁrst studied in 1974 [10]. In that work precessing mag-
netization was induced by a train of ultrashort pulses.
Signiﬁcant enhancement in magnetization was observed
as the splitting between Zeeman sublevels of Cr3+-ion
became multiple of the pulse repetiotion rate. However,
no eﬀect of Zeeman coherence on the absorptive proper-
ties of the crystal was studied.

To understand how the above theoretical description
applies to ruby, let us consider the energy levels of Cr3+
in that crystal (see Fig.2). Its ground state is described

lowed for σ-polarization in B ⊥ c geometry are indicated.

is the zero-ﬁeld splitting of the ground state, and S = 3/2
is the spin of Cr3+. The excited optical state is split into
two spin-doublets separated by 29 cm−1 giving rise to
R1 (694.3 nm) and R2 (692.9 nm) optical lines of ruby.
The width of both optical transitions is 11 cm−1 while
the oscillator strength is 7.5 × 10−7.

The situation when B ⊥ c-axis is of particular interest.
The selection rules for σ±-polarizations of light propagat-
ing along the c-axis are summarized in Tables I and II
[11]. The matrix elements are normalized so that the
sum of their squares for each of the σ±-polarizations is
unity. One can easily see that there are a number of
Raman processes connecting levels G1 and G2 and G3
and G4. Since the optical linewidth is greater than the
separation between the ground-state Zeeman sublevels,
all Λ-systems will give their contributions to the Zeeman
coherence excitation. Therefore, if one uses a linearly
polarized laser light, the net contribution of all Raman
processes to the coherence excitation at either G1 ↔ G2
or G3 ↔ G4 transition is exactly zero. For example,
at R2-line the coherence between levels G1 and G2 due
to Raman process going though E3 for σ+-polarization
is exactly compensated by the one going though E4 for
σ−-polarization. The situation is the same for R1-line.
However, there is no such diﬃculty for circularly polar-
ized light.

The experiments were performed on a 3 × 3 × 5 mm3
dilute ruby crystal (0.002% of Cr3+) with c-axis being
perpendicular to one of 3 × 5 mm2 sides (Scientiﬁc Ma-
terials Corp.) A homemade tunable Ti:Sapphire laser
pumped by the doubled N d : Y LF pulsed laser (Photon-
ics Industries, model GM-30) could operate both in a long

pulse regime (pulse duration ≈ 30 ns FWHM) and in a
mode-locked regime delivering ≈ 30 ns pulse trains with
repetition rate ≈ 260 M Hz. The laser was mode-locked
by using a cryptocyanine saturable absorber dissolved in
ethanol. The typical output energy per pulse or per train
was several tenths of a mJ at a 100 Hz repetition rate.
The laser polarization was linear. The typical shapes of
pulses in both regimes are shown on the insets of Figs.3
and 4. The shape of the pulse train was taken with a
350 ps-risetime photodiode and a 500 M Hz-bandwidth
oscilloscope. The duration of each individual pulse in the
train was not measured. The crystal was placed into a
varying magnetic ﬁeld with B ⊥ c-axis and illuminated
by laser pulses sent through a λ/4-plate and focused by
an f = 10 cm lens. Presumably, the laser spot diameter
at the sample was ∼ 100 µm. The ﬂuorescence was de-
tected as a function of slowly varying periodic magnetic
ﬁeld. The sweeping frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld was
0.17 Hz.

The experimental results for the case of long pulse ex-
citation for both R1 and R2 lines are shown in Fig.3.
The spectra were averaged over several hundreds of mag-
netic ﬁeld sweeps. In the case of R1-line, there are two
features present in the spectrum: the broad one with
the plateau on the bottom and a sharp one of much
smaller amplitude. The smaller one corresponds to less
than 0.5% decrease in the ﬂuorescence amplitude and
has a width of 18 G. It corresponds to CPT resonance
due to G1 ↔ E1, E2 ↔ G2 Λ-system, thus its width in
terms of frequency units is ≈ 100 M Hz since g-factor
for G1 ↔ G2 transition is ≈ 4. The broad drop in ﬂuo-
rescence signal has an amplitude ≈ 7 − 8%. Its FWHM
is close to ≈ 950 G. The presence of plateau at the
bottom of that feature indicates that this is a CPT res-
onance in the G3 ↔ E1, E2 ↔ G4 Λ-system with levels
G3 and G4 being split very slowly as the magnetic ﬁeld
increases. Its width recalculated into frequency domain

3

is ≈ 40 − 50 M Hz, i.e. this CPT resonance is, in fact,
much sharper than the one discussed above. The pos-
sible explanation for this fact is as follows. The main
contribution to the EPR linewidth of Cr3+ in ruby is
known to originate from magnetic dipole-dipole hyper-
ﬁne interaction with neighboring 27Al nuclei [12]. Thus,
the magnetic-allowed Zeeman transition G1 ↔ G2 should
be broadened much stronger than the magnetic-forbidden
G3 ↔ G4. This also explains more than an order of mag-
nitude diﬀerence in the amplitudes of those two CPT
resonances, since in Λ-system with longer-lived Zeeman
coherence CPT should be more pronounced.

It has the width of 18 G, i.e.

as the one observed at R1-line, thus it corresponds to
G1 ↔ E3, E4 ↔ G2 Λ-system. The decrease in the ﬂuo-
rescence is 3−4% at the center of the resonance. The fact
that this resonance is much stronger is easily understand-
able, since 1) there is no background ﬂuorescence excited
from the other pair of levels, G3 and G4, and 2) the
transitions G1, G2 ↔ E3, E4 are 3 times stronger than
G1, G2 ↔ E1, E2. The smooth background originates,
probably, from level mixing in high magnetic ﬁelds and
consequent change in the optical selection rules. That
was conﬁrmed by removing the λ/4-plate, i.e. by mak-
ing laser light linearly polarized. Under this condition
all three CPT resonances, discussed above, disappeared,
as they were supposed to, while the smooth feature in
question remained.

The results for trains of ultrashort pulses are shown in
In the spectrum obtained for R1-line additional

resonances appear in pairs. They are not equidistant be-
cause of nonlinear dependence of the levels G3 and G4
separation on the magnetic ﬁeld strength. However, if
recalculated into frequency domain, their positions ex-
actly correspond to the harmonics of laser repetition rate
(260 M Hz). The ﬁrst three of them are shown on the
inset of Fig.4a. Their widths (FWHM) are in the range
35−38 M Hz and their positions, according to the ﬁt, are
265 M Hz, 533 M Hz, and 804 M Hz. The widths are in
rather good agreement with the result obtained for the
G3 ↔ G4 transition in a long pulse regime. It was not
possible to observe multiple CPT resonances correspond-
ing to G1 ↔ E3, E4 ↔ G2 Λ-system with appreciable
signal-to-noise ratio due to very small amplitude of the
CPT eﬀect (< 0.5%) and rather unstable operation of
laser in a mode-locked regime. However, the signature
of these resonances is the increased quasi-noise at the
bottom of the broad feature.

For R2-line almost 30 CPT resonances are indicated.
In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the original
spectrum was ﬂipped with respect to the zero magnetic
ﬁeld and the two sets of data were combined together.
That explains the fact that the plot shown in Fig.4b is
completely symmetric. The magnetic ﬁeld separation be-

4

tween each pair of resonances is ≈ 45 G. This value cor-
responds to 252 M Hz of frequency separation which is
somewhat close to 260 M Hz of laser repetition rate. Due
to rather poor signal-to-noise ratio and rater low spectral
resolution it is not possible to determine the linewidth of
resonances exactly, but it seems to correspond rather well
to the value of 18 G obtained in a long pulse regime.

In summary, the ﬁrst observation of CPT in a crystal
at room temperature is reported. Possible applications of
the reported phenomena include room-temperature all-
optical analogue of EPR spectroscopy in low magnetic
ﬁelds, suppression of excited state absorption in laser
crystals [13], alternative technique of mode-locking in
lasers [14], etc.

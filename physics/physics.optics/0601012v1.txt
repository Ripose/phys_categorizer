Abstract Diffractive/refractive optics, such as Phase Fresnel Lenses (PFL’s), of-
fer the potential to achieve excellent imaging performance in the x-ray and gamma-
ray photon regimes. In principle, the angular resolution obtained with these de-
vices can be diffraction limited. Furthermore, improvements in signal sensitivity
can be achieved as virtually the entire ﬂux incident on a lens can be concentrated
onto a small detector area. In order to verify experimentally the imaging perfor-
mance, we have fabricated PFL’s in silicon using gray-scale lithography to pro-
duce the required Fresnel proﬁle. These devices are to be evaluated in the recently
constructed 600-meter x-ray interferometry testbed at NASA/GSFC. Proﬁle mea-
surements of the Fresnel structures in fabricated PFL’s have been performed and
have been used to obtain initial characterization of the expected PFL imaging ef-
ﬁciencies.

[1,2]. In principle, PFL’s can concentrate nearly the entire incident photon ﬂux,
modulo absorption effects, with diffraction-limited imaging performance. The im-
pact of absorption is energy and material dependent, but can be almost negligible
at higher photon energies. The performance of these diffraction optics is obtained
via tailoring the Fresnel proﬁle of each zone to yield the appropriate phase at the
primary focal point. However, PFL’s have long focal lengths and are chromatic;
the excellent imaging is available over a narrow energy range. In order to demon-
strate the imaging capabilities of these optics, we have fabricated ground-testable
PFL’s in silicon.

2 Stepping to PFL’s

PFL’s are a natural extension of Fresnel-diffractive optics. As opposed to Fresnel
Zone Plates (FZP), where alternating half-period or Fresnel zones are completely
blocked, and Phase-reversal Zone Plates, where the blocked zone in a FZP is re-
placed by an amount of material to retard the phase by p , the entire proﬁle of
each Fresnel zone in a PFL has the appropriate amount of material to achieve the
proper phase shift at the primary focus. In practice, the exact proﬁle of a PFL can
be approximated by a multiple-step structure as shown in Figure 1 which illus-
trates the ﬁrst four Fresnel zones of a PFL with 4 steps approximating the ideal
k/P
PFL proﬁle. The location of the radial step transitions is given by rk = r1
2 f l ) is the location of the ﬁrst Fresnel ridge ( f is the focal length
where r1(=
and l
the photon wavelength) and P is the number of steps/Fresnel ridge with a
step index of k. This choice leads to annuli, as deﬁned by each step, of constant
area on the PFL. Each contributes equally, ignoring absorption, to the intensity at

p

p

p
a given focal point. This conﬁguration of the stepped-phase proﬁle is denoted as a
regular-stepped PFL.

For an exact PFL proﬁle, all the irradiance appears in the ﬁrst order (n = 1)
focus. In a stepped-proﬁle approximation, some energy appears in negative and
higher order foci. Ignoring absorptive effects, the impact on the lens efﬁciency of
approximating the exact PFL proﬁle by a step-wise function is given by [3]

Lrn =

f or (n − 1)/P = m ∈ Integer

where Lrn is the relative intensity into the nth order focus for P steps in each
Fresnel zone. As P increases, the indices with non-zero intensities of both the real
and virtual higher order foci are pushed to higher n with the relative intensities
into these higher orders decreasing. In the limiting case where P → ¥
, the proﬁle
is exact for the PFL with the relative intensity in the 1st order (n = 1) going to
100% (and the indices of the higher order foci being sent to ±¥
). More practically,
a stepped-PFL with P = 8 per Fresnel zone has 95% efﬁciency focussing into the
1st order focal point, sans absorption.

The material needed in a PFL to retard the phase also will attenuate the ﬂux
of incident photons. The index of refraction of matter can be expressed as n∗ =
1 − d − ib and is related to atomic scattering factors [4]. Thus for a photon of
wavelength l , a material of thickness t will retard the phase by j = 2p td /l while
attenuating the intensity by e−t/t where t = (4pb
)−1. The attenuating effects of
the material in a Fresnel zone of a stepped-PFL can be calculated by determining
the amplitude of the waveform traversing each step of the PFL proﬁle. If ti is the
material thickness of the ith step in a particular Fresnel zone, the phase will be
retarded by j
i−1
and y

i. As shown in Figure 1, the ith step retards the phase between y

i, and the amplitude can be expressed as [5]

Note that circular symmetry is assumed for the PFL, and this calculation is for a
single Fresnel zone. If a PFL contains a total of M individual Fresnel zones with
identical, in phase, proﬁles, the irradiance at the focus would be increased by M2
as each Fresnel zone has the same area on the PFL. This formulation holds for

any step spacing, regular or irregular, as long as a sufﬁciently small scale exists
where the phase thickness is effectively constant. Choosing an energy of 8 keV,
the efﬁciency of a P = 8 regular-stepped PFL, including absorption, is 82.3% in
silicon. If absorption is ignored, the efﬁciency is 95% which is exactly that as
determined from Equation 1 for n = 1.

3 Ground-test Constraints and PFL Fabrication

For a PFL with diameter d, minimum Fresnel ridge spacing pmin, focusing at a
photon wavelength l , the focal length is given by

where f is in meters for pmin in m m, d in cm, and E in keV in Equation 6. Using
the representative values of pmin = 25 m m, d = 1 cm, and E = 8 keV (Cu K-a ),
the focal length would be 800 meters which is rather long for a ground-test.

At NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, a 600-meter Interferometry Testbed is
available for testing of PFL optics. The nominal conﬁguration has an optics station
150 meters from an x-ray source and a detector station 450 meters from the optics
station. Assuming the x-ray emission is isotropic within the ﬁeld-of-view of the
optics, the effective focal length of an optic focussing at the detector station would
be fE f f = f1 f2
= 112.5 meters. This sets the value of the focal length of a PFL
f1+ f2
for incorporation into this test beam conﬁguration. Using f = 112.5 meters, d = 1
cm, and E = 8 keV, this leads to a minimum Fresnel ridge spacing of 3.5 m m
which is the natural scale size for micro-fabrication in silicon. The Fresnel ridge
height needed to retard the phase by 2p
is the
photon wavelength and d
is the real part of the index of refraction. For silicon,
t2p ≈ 2.57

is given by t2p = l /d where l

3.1 PFL fabrication using Gray-scale lithography

The gray-scale lithographic fabrication process has been employed at the Uni-
versity of Maryland to create PFL structures in silicon wafers [6]. This imple-
mentation of the gray-scale process employs a lithographic mask that uses small,
variable-transmission pixels (gray levels) that create, via projection photolithog-
raphy, a designed, 3-dimensional structure in a photoresist spun on a silicon wafer.
This pattern is then transferred into the silicon via deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE).
The developed ground-test PFL’s have been fabricated using silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) wafers in order to minimize the thickness of the required mechanical sub-
strate under the PFL’s and thus maximize the x-ray photon transmission. The
sandwiched oxide layer forms a natural etch stop to remove the silicon substrate
directly under each PFL while leaving the surrounding material for mechanical
stability. The unprocessed SOI wafer was 100 mm in diameter with 70 m m of

silicon, 2 m m oxide, and 500 m m silicon forming the SOI wafer structure. A pro-
totype silicon PFL fabricated using the gray-scale lithographic process is shown
in Figure 2.

Table 1 lists the four PFL designs that have been included in this ground-test
fabrication. Note that this PFL fabrication incorporated a design to produce 4p ,
as opposed to 2p
thick Fresnel optics. This was chosen for this initial fabrication
to effectively double the minimum ridge spacing, pmin, for a set focal length, PFL
diameter, and design energy. Although this will increase absorption losses, the
relaxation of the pmin requirement eased the constraints on the device fabrication.
The four PFL’s, along with several test structures, were grouped to form a die
which is compact in spatial extent. Twelve of these dice in a 3 × 4 array were
fabricated on the 100 mm SOI wafer via a step-and-repeat process.

The goal of this fabrication was to produce a sample of PFL’s for testing in the
600 m beam line, and the process was not optimized for yield. In order to identify
the optimal PFL’s for testing, an optical inspection rejected those with obvious
defects. This rejected 15 out of the possible 48 PFL’s. The remaining PFL’s were
scanned via an optical proﬁlometer (Veeco, WYKO NT1100) to determine the ac-
curacy of the fabricated proﬁles. For the 3 mm diameter PFL’s, the ﬁrst and last
5 Fresnel ridges were scanned and compared to the design proﬁle. For the 5 mm
PFL, the 5 ridges near the half radius were also scanned and compared. Using an
analysis similar to that presented in Equation 4, albeit ignoring absorption and us-

ing a phasor formalism, the efﬁciency of each scanned PFL was estimated from the
proﬁles obtained from the proﬁlometer measurements. Note that the proﬁles are
measured along a chosen radial path and circular symmetry was assumed. Figure
3 illustrates the proﬁle measurements and a comparison to the design proﬁle for
a 3 mm diameter PFL (X3) for the regions near the center of the device (leftmost
plot) and near the edge (rightmost plot).

4 PFL Anticipated Performance

Table 2 lists the maximum, minimum, and average efﬁciency for the different fab-
ricated PFL’s based upon the proﬁle measurements. The values for the maxima and
minima quoted for a PFL are that for a speciﬁc lens, i.e. the ensemble of measure-

m
m
7

ments for a speciﬁc design were used to determine the appropriate designation.
The quoted efﬁciencies do not take into account absorptive losses due to either
the Fresnel proﬁle or the ∼ 25 m m substrate. Assuming an 8 step/Fresnel ridge
proﬁle and 8 keV, the reduction in collection efﬁciency is approximately 14%,
i.e. 1 − 0.82
0.95 , due to the phase-retarding material in the stepped-Fresnel proﬁle and
30%, i.e. 1 − e−25 m m/70 m m, due to the 25 m m silicon substrate. Note that the ef-
fects of attenuation can be signiﬁcantly reduced by fabricating PFL’s designed for
higher photon energies.

The data represented in Table 2 demonstrate that, as indicated from proﬁle
measurements, stepped-proﬁle PFL’s micro-fabricated in silicon have efﬁciencies
signiﬁcantly larger than that for the simpler zone plates and phase-reversal zone
plates. The data also illustrate that efﬁciencies determined from the ﬁner pitch
Fresnel zones are reduced as compared to the larger pitch center Fresnel zones.
This is due to the fact that it is more difﬁcult to accurately fabricate zones with
higher aspect ratios, deﬁned as the ratio of Fresnel ridge height to ridge pitch. A
signiﬁcant contribution to this effect is due to the aspect-ratio dependence of the
etching process; it is more difﬁcult to remove silicon from narrow ridge regions as
shown in Figure 3. Work has progressed on designing appropriate compensation in
the lithographic mask and this technique has been demonstrated in the fabrication
of a second-generation of Fresnel Lens structures that exhibit a much reduced
aspect-ratio dependence of the PFL proﬁles [7].

There are three components contributing to the angular resolution of a PFL:
diffraction, detector spatial resolution, and chromatic aberration. For the 3 mm
ground-test PFL imaging at 8 keV, the values of each of these terms is given by

Diffraction Limit :
Detector Spatial Limit :
Chromatic Aberration Limit[1] :

J D = 1.22l /d = 8 milli−arcseconds (m′′)
J s = D x/F = 6 m′′
(7)
D E = 0.2(D E/E)(d/F) = 5 m′′

J

where a D x = 13 m m detector pixel size is assumed with D E = 140 eV FWHM
and F = 450 meters. Note that the contribution to the angular resolution from
the chromatic aberration term is reduced if one assumes the Cu K-a
line width.
Thus the anticipated angular resolution of these ground-test PFL’s are ∼ 10 milli-
arcseconds (m′′) which is a signiﬁcant improvement to that obtained from current
astronomical missions, e.g. 500 m′′ for CHANDRA [8], in this energy range.

5 Conclusions

We have fabricated ground-test PFL’s in silicon using gray-scale lithography. We
have determined the imaging performance of these devices via analysis of the
measured proﬁles of the fabricated optics. These results indicate that the efﬁcien-
cies, although less than ideal, are a signiﬁcant improvement over the theoretical
maximum that can be obtained with zone plates and phase-reversal zone plates.
We plan on introducing these devices into the 600 m test beam to demonstrate
their imaging capability and verify the anticipated efﬁciency determination via in
situ x-ray measurements. This material is based upon work supported by the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant APRA04-0000-0087 is-

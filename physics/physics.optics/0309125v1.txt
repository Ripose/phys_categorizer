Abstract

The near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of fs and sub-fs light pulses by nm-size slit-type apertures and its

implication for near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is analyzed. The amplitude distri-

butions of the diﬀracted wave-packets having the central wavelengths in the visible spectral region

are found by using the Neerhoﬀ and Mur coupled integral equations, which are solved numerically

for each Fourier’s component of the wave-packet. In the case of fs pulses, the duration and trans-

verse dimensions of the diﬀracted pulse remain practically the same as that of the input pulse.

This demonstrates feasibility of the NSOM in which a fs pulse is used to provide the fs temporal

resolution together with nm-scale spatial resolution. In the sub-fs domain, the Fourier spectrum of

the transmitted pulse experiences a considerable narrowing that leads to the increase of the pulse

duration in a few times. This imposes a limit on the simultaneous resolutions in time and space.

INTRODUCTION

The near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of light by sub-wavelength apertures and its implication for near-

ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) has been investigated over the last decade [1, 2].

In NSOM, a sub-wavelength aperture illuminated by a continuous wave is used as a near-ﬁeld

light source providing the super (sub-wavelength) resolution in space. In the last few years,

a big interest of researchers attracted the study of near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of ultra-short light

pulses aimed at obtaining the simultaneous super-resolutions in space and time (for example,

see the studies [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and references therein). The studies of NSOM-

pulse system primarily dealt with the diﬀraction of relatively long (ps) far-infrared pulses

by µm-size apertures [7, 8, 9, 10]. It was shown that at particular experimental conditions a

ps pulse experiences signiﬁcant spectral [9, 10] and temporal [7, 8, 9, 10] deformations when

diﬀracted by a µm-size aperture. The deformations lead to a modiﬁcation of the temporal

resolution associated with the incident ps-pulse. The recent study [9] indicated that spatial

resolution of the NSOM performing with ps pulses is deﬁned by the aperture size and it is

independent of the wavelength.

The use of ps pulses in NSOM provides ps temporal resolution together with µm-scale

spatial resolution. The achievement of higher simultaneous resolutions in space and time

is challenging. The NSOM performing with a continuous wave provides nm-scale spatial

resolution [1, 2]. High-harmonic generation produces near 0.5-fs (500 as) wave-packets with

50-nm central wavelengths [12, 13]. A method of generation of sub-as pulses has been

already suggested in Ref. [14]. The perspective is the achievement of the simultaneous nm-

scale spatial resolution together with the fs or sub-fs temporal resolution.

In the visible

spectral region, which is the most important domain for potential applications, the NSOM-

pulse system can be realized using the conventional setup of NSOM. Unfortunately, the

capabilities and limits of simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions of such a system are

not known. From a theoretical point of view, the most important questions are the degree

of collimating, the duration of the ultra-short pulse past the sub-wavelength aperture and

the rate of spatial and temporal broadening of the pulse farther from the aperture. To

address these questions, the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of fs and sub-fs pulses by a nm-size slit-

type aperture in a perfectly conducting thick screen is theoretically studied in the present

paper.

2

The article is organized as follows. The theoretical approach used for ﬁnding the am-

plitude distribution of the ultra-short pulse in the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone of the sub-

wavelength aperture is described in Section II. Results of computer simulation of the near-

ﬁeld diﬀraction and discussion of the capabilities and limits of simultaneous spatial and

temporal resolutions of the NSOM-pulse system are presented in Section III.

II. THEORY

Owing to the complicity of boundary conditions of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction experiment,

the solution of the Helmholtz wave-equation even for a continuous wave can be obtained

only by extremely extended computations. In order to simplify the computations, the NSOM

model is usually restricted to two dimensions of a slit-type aperture [15, 16]. The combi-

nation of NSOM with an ultra-short pulse makes the numerical analysis of the problem

even more diﬃcult. In the present article, we consider a model of the NSOM-pulse system

based on the transmission of fs and sub-fs pulses through a nm-size slit-type aperture in a

perfectly conducting thick screen. The amplitude distribution of the diﬀracted wave-packet

is found by using the Neerhoﬀ and Mur coupled integral equations [15, 16], which are solved

numerically for each Fourier’s component of the wave-packet.

Let us brieﬂy describe the integral approach of Neerhoﬀ and Mur, which was developed in

the studies [15, 16] for ﬁnding the near-ﬁeld distributions of the amplitude and intensity of

a continuous wave diﬀracted by a sub-wavelength slit in a perfectly conducting thick screen.

In the region I, the continuous plane wave falls onto the slit at an angle θ with respect to

the z-axis in the x

z plane, as shown in Fig. 1. The slit width and the screen thickness

−

are 2a and b, respectively. The magnetic ﬁeld of the incident wave is assumed to be time

harmonic and both polarized and constant in the direction y:

~H(x, y, z, t) = U(x, z)exp(

iωt)~ey.

−

(1)

The electric ﬁeld of the incident wave is found by using the Maxwell equations for the
ﬁeld ~H. The restrictions in Eq. 1 reduce the diﬀraction problem to one involving a single

scalar ﬁeld in only two dimensions. The Green function approach [15, 16] uses the multipole

expansion of the ﬁeld with the Hankel functions in the regions I and III and with the

waveguide eigenmodes in the region II. The expansion coeﬃcients are determined by using

3

the standard boundary conditions for a perfectly conducting screen. In region III, the near-
ﬁeld distributions of the magnetic ~H(x, z, t) and electric ~E = Ex~ex + Ey~ey ﬁelds of the

diﬀracted wave are given by

We now consider the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of an ultra-short light pulse. For the sake of

simplicity, we assume that a pulse falls normally (Θ = 0) on the aperture. The magnetic

ﬁeld of the incident pulse is assumed to be Gaussian-shaped in time and both polarized and

constant in the direction y:

~H(x, y, z, t) = U(x, z)exp[

where τ is the pulse duration and ω0 is the central frequency. The pulse can be composed

in the wave-packet form of a Fourier time expansion [18]:

The ﬁeld distribution of the diﬀracted pulse is found by using the expressions (2-4) for each

Fourier’s ω-component of the wave-packet (6). The algorithm was implemented numerically

in section III. In the computations, we used the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
of the function ~H(x, y, z, t) instead of the integral composition (6). The spectral interval

[ωmin, ωmax] and the sampling points ωi were optimized by matching the FFT composition

to the original function (5).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, the amplitude distribution of the diﬀracted pulse is found by using the ex-

pressions (2-4) for each Fourier’s ω-component of the wave-packet (6). In order to establish

guidelines for the computational results, we ﬁrst consider the dependence of the amplitude

of a time-harmonic continuous plane wave (a FFT ω-component of the wave-packet) trans-

mitted through the aperture on the the wave frequency ω = 2πc/λ. The amplitude of

a transmitted FFT ω-component depends on the frequency ω. Owing to this eﬀect, the

Fourier spectra and duration of the wave-packet are changed under propagation through the

aperture leading to modiﬁcation of the temporal and spatial resolutions associated with the

input pulse. The dispersion for a time-harmonic continuous wave is usually described by

the normalized transmission coeﬃcient Tcw. The coeﬃcient is calculated by integrating the
normalized energy ﬂux Sz/Si

z over the slit value [16, 17]:

(7)

where Si

z is the energy ﬂuxe of the the incident wave of unit amplitude; Sz is the transmitted

ﬂux. The ﬁrst objective of our computer analysis was to check the consistency of the results

by comparing the transmission coeﬃcients calculated in the studies [16, 17] with those

obtained by our computations. We have computed the coeﬃcient Tcw = Tcw(λ, a, b) for

diﬀerent slit widths 2a and a variety of screen thicknesses b. The results are presented

in Fig. 2 for the wavelength λ=500 nm. We notice that the transmission resonances of

λ/2 periodicity [16, 17] are reproduced. Furthermore, the resonance positions and the peak
heights (Tcw≈
Notice, that Tcw≈
the given values of a and b is shown in Fig. 3. We notice that the the amplitude of the

λ/2πa > 1 in the case of a < λ/2π. The dispersion Tcw = Tcw(λ) for

λ/2πa [16], at the resonances) are in agreement with the results [16, 17].

short-wavelength waves is practically unchanged, while the amplitude of the long-wavelength

components increases. Thus, eﬀectively, the aperture ”cuts oﬀ” the short-wavelength FFT-

components of the wave packet (6).

Owing to the ”cut-oﬀ frequency” eﬀect, the Fourier spectrum of the wave-packet narrows

under transmission through the aperture. According to the Fourier analysis, the decrease

of the spectral width of the wave packet leads to increase of the pulse duration and to

modiﬁcation of the temporal resolution associated with the incident pulse. The capabilities

5

and limits of simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions of the NSOM-pulse system are

not known. From a theoretical point of view, the most important questions are the degree

of collimating, the duration of the ultra-short pulse past the sub-wavelength aperture and

the rate of spatial and temporal broadening of the pulse farther from the aperture. To

address these questions, the near-ﬁeld amplitude distributions of fs and sub-fs pulses passed

through a nm-size slit-type aperture was computed. The amplitude distribution

of the

diﬀracted wave-packet was computed for diﬀerent values of the incident-pulse duration τ ,

(Figs. 4 and 5). Figures 4 and 5 show the amplitude distributions for the cases of τ = 2 fs

and 750 as, respectively. Notice, that the value 2a = 50 nm is the minimum aperture size,

which is generally accepted for the practical near-ﬁeld (z

a) microscopy in the visible

spectral region (λ

500nm) [16].

≈

Analysis of Figs. 4(a) and 5(a) shows that the pulse is collimated to exactly the aperture

width at the edge of the screen. Hence, the basic concept of NSOM remains valid for the

ultra-short pulses: the fs or sub-fs pulse passing through a nm-size aperture can be used

to provide a sub-wavelength (nm-scale) image, super-resolution in space. We notice that in
the case of Fig. 4a, the duration τ ′ of the diﬀracted pulse at the screen edge is practically
the same as that of the incident pulse (τ ′

2fs). Thus, the temporal resolution associated

≈

with the duration of the incident 2-fs pulse is practically unchanged past the aperture. This

demonstrates the possibility of the simultaneous nm-scale resolution in space and the fs

resolution in time. In the case of the attosecond pulse (τ = 750as), the Fourier spectrum of

the transmitted pulse experiences suﬃcient narrowing. This leads to the increase of the pulse

duration in a few times (Fig. 5(a)). In the visible spectral region, this eﬀect imposes a limit

on the simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions. It could be noted that the increase of

the pulse duration in the case of the attosecond pulses can be reduced by decreasing of the

central wavelength of the incident wave-packet [11]. Further analysis of Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)

indicates that the amplitude distribution of the diﬀracted wave-packet is characterized by

the formation of maxima at the rims of the aperture. Notice, that the similar eﬀect exists

in the case of the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of a continuous wave [19].

The results presented in Figs. 4(b) and 5(b) indicate the possibilities and limits of the

6

simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions at the distance (z =

a). In the case of the

−

2-fs incident pulse, the spatial resolution of the NSOM-pulse system is approximately equal

to the geometrical projection of the aperture at the distance of half the aperture width

(see, Fig. 4b). This result demonstrates the practical possibility of the simultaneous 50-nm

resolution in space and the fs resolution in time. The value of 50 nm is the practical limit

of the spatial resolution also for NSOM the NSOM performing with a continuous wave [16].

The spatial resolution of the NSOM-pulse system in the case of the 750-as incident pulse

(see, Fig. 5(b)) is approximately two times lower respect to the case of Fig. 4(b). This

results indicates that the spatial resolution of the NSOM-pulse system in the sub-fs domain

depends on the value of the incident-pulse duration. It can be noted that spatial resolution

of the SNOM-pulse system performing with ps pulses is deﬁned only by the aperture size

and independent of the wavelength [9].

It is clear now that the spatial resolution of the

NSOM-pulse system is diﬀerent for each FFT ω-component of the wave packet. The lowest

spatial resolution is achieved for the FFT ω-component having the lowest frequency ωLW
. The value ωLW = ω0 −
∆ω of the wave-packet. The width ∆ω

∆ω/2 depends on the central frequency ω0 and spectral width

1/τ increases with decreasing of the duration τ .

Therefore, the spatial resolution of the NSOM-pulse system increases with the increase of

the values of τ and ω0.

In the far-ﬁeld region (z =

10a), we notice the considerable temporal and spatial

broadenings and the wave-shape changes in the cases of the 2-fs and 750-as incident pulses

(Figs. 4(c) and 5(c)). We also notice the existence of the negative time delay of the diﬀracted

pulse respect to the point t = 0. The time advancement increases with the increase of the

distance z (see, Figs. 4(a-c) and 5(a-c)). The time-advancement eﬀect is in agreement with

the superluminar behaviour of the light pulses described in the study [21].

In the present model of the NSOM-pulse system we used the standard boundary condi-

tions based on the assumption of the perfect conductivity of the screen. The super-resolution

capabilities of the system in time and space is a consequence of the assumption. The perfect

conductivity is a good approximation in a situation involving a thick metal screen of suﬃ-

cient opacity for a fs wave-packet having the central wavelength (λ0 = 500nm) in the visible

spectral region. However, in the case of sub-fs pulses the decrease of the metal conductiv-

ity with decreasing the wavelength should be taken into account for the short-wavelength

components of the wave-packet. The conductivity dispersion should lead to some decrease

≈

−

7

of the spatial and temporal resolutions of the NSOM-pulse system based on the use of sub-

fs pulses.

It should be noted that the presence of a microscopic sample (a molecule, for

example) placed in strong interaction with the NSOM aperture modiﬁes the boundary con-

ditions. In the case of the strong interaction, which takes place in the region z <

0.1a,

−

the application of the standard boundary conditions practically impossible. Probably, in

this region the problem can be overcome by combination of a microscopic and macroscopic

descriptions of NSOM [20], where the response function accounting for the modiﬁcation of

the quantum mechanical behaviour of the molecule is derived self-consistently through the

solution of Dyson’s equation.

IV. CONCLUSION

The near-ﬁeld diﬀraction of fs and sub-fs light pulses by nm-size slit-type apertures and

its implication for near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) has been analyzed. The

amplitude distributions of the diﬀracted wave-packets having the central wavelengths in the

visible spectral region were have been found by using the Neerhoﬀ and Mur coupled integral

equations, which were solved numerically for each Fourier’s component of the wave-packet.

In the case of fs pulses, the duration and transverse dimensions of the diﬀracted pulse remain

practically the same as that of the input pulse. This demonstrates feasibility of the NSOM in

which a fs pulse is used to provide the fs temporal resolution together with nm-scale spatial

resolution. In the sub-fs domain, the Fourier spectrum of the transmitted pulse experiences

a considerable narrowing that leads to the increase of the pulse duration in a few times. This

imposes a limit on the simultaneous resolutions in time and space. The results demonstrate

the capabilities and limits of simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions of the NSOM

based on the use of the ultra-short light pulses.

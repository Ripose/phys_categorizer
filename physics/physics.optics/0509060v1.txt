We combine a tunable continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator and a femtosecond
Ti:Sapphire laser frequency comb to provide a phase-coherent bridge between the visible and
mid-infrared spectral ranges. As a ﬁrst demonstration of this new technique we perform a direct
frequency comparison between an iodine stabilized Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm and an infrared
methane optical frequency standard at 3.39 µm.

(cw-
Continuous-wave optical parametric oscillators
OPOs) are one of the most promising infrared (IR) laser
sources for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy.1,2
They oﬀer wide tuning range and high output power
levels,3,4,5 as well as narrow linewidth and the possibil-
ity of phase locking to stable optical references.6,7 Com-
bining them with recently developed optical frequency
combs based on femtosecond lasers8,9,10,11 opens up new
perspectives in optical metrology. In such a system the
special properties of the OPO allow it to serve as a bidi-
rectional coherent bridge linking the IR and visible spec-
tral ranges (Fig. 1).6 For example, an infrared methane
optical frequency standard12,13 can be used as a highly
stable reference for an OPO and a visible frequency comb.
Alternatively, an OPO phase locked to a visible frequency
comb, which itself is referenced to a high performance mi-
crowave or optical clock, can provide stable emission with
known absolute frequency in both the mid-IR and tele-
com spectral ranges. In this Letter we present the ﬁrst
implementation of this new technique.

Methods of femtosecond optical frequency metrology
are based on the establishment of a phase-coherent re-
lation between an optical frequency and that of a pri-
mary microwave clock or of an optical frequency stan-
dard. This is achieved using a comb of equidistant
lines with frequencies fn = n frep + f0, where n is an
integer, frep, the repetition rate, and f0, the carrier-
envelope oﬀset frequency of the femtosecond laser, with
f0 < frep.8,9,10,11 Current optical frequency combs are
predominantly based on mode-locked Ti:Sapphire and
Er:ﬁber lasers. Their output is thus restricted to the visi-
ble and near-IR spectral ranges, while building an optical
clockwork capable of addressing the mid-IR range has
remained a challenge. Application of frequency combs
for this purpose requires their combination with addi-
tional steps of sum- or diﬀerence-frequency generation
(SFG and DFG).14,15,16,17,18

SFG clockworks need for their realization additional
transfer oscillators such as diode lasers or a commer-
cial cw-OPO.14,15 Oﬀset-free DFG combs, which are
produced in the IR by mixing either the output of
two synchronized visible frequency combs16 or diﬀerent
spectral components of a specially designed Ti:Sapphire

laser,18 have very low output power (tens of µW total,
with < 1 nW per comb mode). All these approaches
phase-coherently connect IR frequencies and primary mi-
crowave clocks via frep but not the optical frequencies.
They are either tailored to very speciﬁc goals or quite
complex, and generally they require a number of non-
linear crystals and supplementary lasers to make them
useful for spectroscopic applications. Thus, a speciﬁc
beneﬁt of the new method presented here is that it con-
solidates all these subsystems into a single cw-OPO, pro-
viding direct phase-coherent link between two optical fre-
quencies — the visible and the infrared.

The scheme itself is based on the fact that a singly res-
onant + pump resonant cw-OPO emits not only strong
signal (S) and idler (I) waves, but also a set of weak (a
few µW) components resulting from non-phase-matched
mixing processes of the resonated pump (P=S+I) and
signal waves.6 Some of these (2S, P+S, 2P) are located
within the emission range of a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond
laser comb. Forming suitable diﬀerences of the hetero-
dyne beat frequencies with adjacent comb lines then al-
lows mutual phase locking of OPO optical frequencies
and the microwave frequencies frep and f0 characterizing
the femtosecond comb. This can be implemented follow-
ing a variety of schemes, e.g. the basic four-step locking
scheme as illustrated in Fig. 2:

1. Phase lock the OPO idler frequency I to a He–Ne/CH4
standard.

2. Phase lock the comb spacing frep to the frequency
diﬀerence between the lines P+S and 2S, which is equal
to the already stabilized idler frequency I, [(P+S)-2S=I].

3. Measure and stabilize the diﬀerence between frequen-
cies (P+S) and P, and therefore the signal frequency S
using the comb, [(P+S)-P=S]. As a result, the stability
of the methane standard is transferred to the signal and
pump frequencies, and thus the entire OPO spectrum.
4. Measure and stabilize the comb oﬀset frequency f0
relative to one of the OPO lines, e.g. P.

The ﬁrst two steps by themselves are already suﬃcient
to implement a methane-based infrared optical molecu-
lar clock analogous to that reported by Foreman et al.18
The last two steps then phase lock the whole femtosec-
ond frequency comb and all OPO output lines to the
He–Ne/CH4 standard.

As a ﬁrst realization of this method we have performed
a direct comparison between a Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm)
stabilized on the a10 line of the R(56) 32–0 iodine tran-
sition near 532 nm19 and a He–Ne laser stabilized on the
∼300 kHz wide P (7) F(2)
line of the methane molecule
2
at 3.39 µm. The latter is integrated in a transportable
He–Ne/CH4 optical frequency standard and serves us as
a highly stable (over hundreds of seconds) IR reference
laser12. The methane standard and reference laser were
both previously characterized during several absolute fre-
quency comparisons.13

The experimental arrangement of the frequency com-
parison is shown in Fig. 3. The cw-OPO was speciﬁcally
developed for applications in high-resolution Doppler-free
molecular spectroscopy and metrology.1,6 It is similar to
a system described earlier,1 though modiﬁed to be me-
chanically more stable and featuring improved cavity lock
electronics. The setup is based on a periodically-poled
lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal with multiple grating
periods, pumped by a monolithic 1-W Nd:YAG laser.
The pump and the signal waves are both resonated in
the same, folded cavity, the length of which is locked to
the pump laser using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT).
A specially designed temperature-stabilized intracavity
etalon allows controlled access to any desired wavelength
in a wide OPO emission range: 1.5–1.9 µm (signal) and
2.4–3.7 µm (idler). Using this conﬁguration, we obtain
well-deﬁned tuning behavior of the idler output radiation
at power levels of >50 mW at 3.39 µm, exceptional long-
term stability, and an instantaneous linewidth of about
10 kHz. The idler frequency can easily be phase locked

2

to any optical reference using a phase-locked loop (PLL)
with a bandwidth of ∼15 kHz and by applying the cor-
rection signal to the pump laser PZT.6

Our frequency comb is based on a femtosecond
Ti:Sapphire ring laser (GigaOptics, GigaJet-20) with a
repetition rate frep ∼750 MHz. A continuum between
0.5 and 1.1 µm with a total power of ∼300 mW is gen-
erated in a photonic crystal ﬁber and then split with
a diﬀraction grating into three spectral parts, centered
around the 1064 nm, 775 nm and 631 nm — correspond-
ing to the OPO lines P, 2S and P+S. After additional
ﬁltering with Fabry-Perot etalons these beams are over-
lapped with the related OPO components and sent to
avalanche photodiodes. Typical power levels here are 10,
0.3 and 1 µW for P, 2S and P+S, respectively. The three
resulting OPO beat signals with adjacent comb lines typ-
ically have signal-to-noise ratios of 25-40 dB in a resolu-
tion bandwidth of 100 kHz. In a slight modiﬁcation of
the more general scheme presented above we measured
the iodine frequency relative to the OPO pump laser.

During the comparisons only frep was phase locked to
the methane standard while the comb oﬀset f0 remained
free-running, similarly to the approach of Telle et al.20
Frequency diﬀerences between the relevant ﬁltered and
ampliﬁed beats were processed using double-balanced
mixers. Frequency generators and counters involved were
referenced to a Rubidium microwave standard. The sig-
nal used for phase locking of the comb spacing to the sta-
bilized idler frequency and the ﬁnal signal corresponding
to the iodine stabilized laser frequency were both reﬁned
using tracking oscillators. The iodine frequency signal
was then recorded using a PC-based counter board.

Fig. 4 shows the resulting relative Allan deviation av-
eraged over diﬀerent measurement runs (counter gate
times between 1 ms to 10 s). The result of the compari-
son is limited by the iodine stabilized laser performance,
which is known from independent measurements relative
to a cryogenic optical resonator (CORE).19 The accu-
racy limitation of the new comparison method itself is

dine and methane stabilized lasers. Also shown are indepen-
dent measurements of a similar iodine system19 with respect

expected to be much lower than 10−13. Continuous mea-
surement time was restricted by the slow degradation of
the photonic crystal ﬁber, which led to non-uniformities
in the comb spectrum and insuﬃcient power levels. The
OPO showed very reliable operation and remained phase
locked to the methane stabilized laser over several days.
We also succeeded in reversing the scheme and phase
locking frep and the idler frequency to the iodine stabi-

lized laser.

As the current comparisons do not yet challenge the
accuracy performance of the system, upcoming measure-
ments will use better optical frequency references (e.g.
CH4 vs CORE) to explore the actual limitations. The
ease-of-use of the setup could be improved by using spe-
cially designed PPLN crystals in order to enhance the
power of the non-phase-matched OPO components 2S
and P+S. Another line of development is to use the
opposite direction of stability transfer in order to pro-
vide stable emission for the purposes of high-resolution
Doppler-free molecular spectroscopy in the infrared with
output power levels up to several Watts using a mod-
iﬁed design.3,5 Speciﬁcally, this should lead to applica-
tions in precision IR spectroscopy, such as metrology of
the strong transitions of cold CH4 molecules6 and the
study of rotation-vibrational transitions in decelerated
and trapped OH-radicals.22

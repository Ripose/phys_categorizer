Cladding structures of photonic band-gap ﬁbers often have air-holes of non-
circular shape and, typically, close-to-hexagonal air holes with curved corners
are observed. We study photonic band-gaps in such structures by aid of a two-
parameter representation of the size and curvature. For the fundamental band-
gap we ﬁnd that the band-gap edges (the intersections with the air line) shift
toward shorter wavelengths when the air-ﬁlling fraction f is increased. The
band-gap also broadens and the relative band-width increases exponentially
with f 2. Comparing to recent experiments [Nature 424, 657 (2003)] we ﬁnd
very good agreement.

In air-silica photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs) an arrange-
ment of air-holes running along the full length of the
ﬁber provides the conﬁnement and guidance of light in
a defect region. For photonic band-gap (PBG) guiding
PCFs the air-holes have been arranged in various ways
such as in a triangular lattice1, but honey-comb2 and
kagome3 arrangements are other options. Cregan et al.1
have demonstrated that light can be guided in an air-
core by means of the PBG eﬀect and this observation
has stimulated an avalanche of both basic and applied
research. For recent reviews we refer to Refs. 4,5 and
references therein.

From a modeling point of view the air-holes are gen-
erally assumed circular6,7 and for ﬁbers fabricated by
the stack-and-pull method this is also typically what
is observed for moderate air-ﬁlling fractions.8 However,
for the high air-ﬁlling fractions f > 0.8 recently em-
ployed for PBG guidance the air-holes tend to be non-
circular.9,10 From a simple geometric consideration it is

≃

easily shown that the theoretical upper limit of the air-
ﬁlling fraction in a structure of close packed circular voids
is f = π/(2√3)
0.91. Hence, design and fabrication
of air-core PBG ﬁbers call for a detailed modeling of the
spectral position of the PBGs which goes beyond the as-
sumption of circular air holes. In this Letter we consider
the triangular cladding arrangement (with a pitch Λ) ﬁrst
employed by Cregan et al.,1 but for the air-holes we take
the non-circular shape observed recently in Refs. 9,10 into
account. From scanning-electron micrographs (SEMs)
we ﬁnd that the air-holes are of over-all hexagonal shape
with curved corners, see Fig. 1 (this conclusion was also
emphasized in Ref. 10). This suggests that the holes can
be parametrized by two parameters; the edge-to-edge dis-
tance D (corresponding to the diameter of a circular air-
hole) and the diameter of curvature, Dc, at the corners
(see left panel of Fig. 1). In this two-parameter represen-
tation the air-ﬁlling fraction is given by

Dc

D

Fig. 1. The right panel shows a scanning-electron mi-
crograph of the cladding structure of a PBG ﬁber with
a pitch of Λ
2.7 µm. The left panel illustrates the
two-parameter representation of the air-hole shape.

For the optical properties we apply Maxwell’s equa-
tions to a macroscopic and isotropic loss-less dielectric
medium and assume a linear dependence of the displace-
ment ﬁeld on the electrical ﬁeld. We consider a harmonic
mode H(r, t) = H ω(r)eiωt with angular frequency ω and

Here, c is the velocity of light and ε is the dielectric func-
tion which we in the following assume independent of
frequency by which the wave equation becomes scale-
invariant. All the results to be presented can thus be
scaled to the desired value of Λ.

For a PCF geometry, the cladding dielectric function
ε(r) is periodic in the transverse plane and translational
invariant along the ﬁber-axis (the z-axis). The solution is
according to Bloch’s theorem a plane wave modulated by
a function hω(r⊥) with the periodicity of the dielectric
structure in the transverse direction

H ω(r) = hω(r⊥) exp(ik⊥

r⊥ + iβz).

Substituting this ansatz into Eq.(2) we get an eigenvalue
problem for ω(k⊥, β) which we solve by the aid of a plane-
wave basis (typically 128
128 plane waves) with periodic
boundary conditions.12 For the dielectric function we use
ε = 1 in air and ε = (1.444)2 = 2.085 in silica. From a
computational point of view our simulations thus follow
the same lines as those used for structures with circular
holes.6

In Fig. 2 we show photonic bands calculated for βΛ =
14.45 and a structure with D/Λ = 0.96 and Dc/Λ = 0.55
(see inset of Fig. 3). It is common to introduce the free-
space wave-number k = 2π/λ = ω/c and plot the ef-
fective index β/k = cβ/ω rather than the angular fre-
quency ω. The bands are plotted as a function of k⊥
along the usual principal directions in the Brillouin zone;
from the Γ-point to the M -point and via the K-point

2

back to the Γ-point.6 As seen the structure exhibits a
band-gap which is particular clear from the ﬁlled curve
which shows the corresponding density-of-states (the pro-
jection of the data onto the y-axis).
In this example
the band-gap is around the index of air (β/k = 1), but
in general the position and width of the band-gaps de-
pend on the propagation constant β. In Fig. 3 we show
the results of changing β. The data-points result from
a sampling of the Brillouin zone along the above men-
tioned principal directions. The PBGs are those regions
with no data-points and the solid lines indicate the cor-
responding band-gap edges. The dashed line shows the
air-line which passes through several band-gaps. Usu-
ally the band-gap at the longest wavelength (the lowest
frequency) is refereed to as the fundamental band-gap
and the other gaps are denoted higher-order band-gaps.6
The slopes of the band-gaps are relatively large which
suggest that e.g.
scattering and bending-loss will in-
crease almost abruptly when the wavelength approaches
the band-edges.

For PBG ﬁbers with an air-core1,9,10 the band-edges
of guided modes will to a good approximation be given
by the intersection of the air-line with the cladding band-
edges in Fig. 3. For the fundamental band-gap we denote
the upper and lower intersections by λu and λl, respec-
tively. We have calculated the band edges for various
values of D and Dc; Fig. 4 summarizes the results. The
band-diagrams of course depend on the two parameters
D and Dc, but we ﬁnd that a single-parameter descrip-
tion of the band-edges is possible in terms of the air-ﬁlling

points result from a sampling of the Brillouin zone along
the usual path from the Γ-point to the M -point and via
the K-point back to the Γ-point. The solid lines indicate
the band-gap boundaries and the dashed line β/k = 1
shows the air line which passes through several band-
gaps.

When the air-ﬁlling fraction is increased the center
λc = (λu + λl)/2 of the band-gap shifts toward shorter
wavelengths. Furthermore, the band-width ∆λ = λu

at the same time increases and the relative band-width
shows a close to exponential increase (see Fig. 5), i.e.

results in Figs. 4,5 support the choice of high air-ﬁlling
fractions for practical ﬁbers and as seen we ﬁnd very good
agreement between our numerics and recent experimental
results by Smith et al.10

In summary, we have shown that realistic PBG
cladding structures9,10 can be represented by an “ideal”
two-parameter description which facilitate detailed nu-
merical modeling. For the fundamental band-gap the
band-gap edges (the intersections with the air line) shift
toward shorter wavelengths for an increasing air-ﬁlling
fraction f and the band-gap also broadens signiﬁcantly.
This observation may make air-core PBG ﬁbers realistic
for wavelengths even shorter than the 850 nm reported
recently by Bouwmans et al.9

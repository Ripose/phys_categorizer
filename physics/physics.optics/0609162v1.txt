We present a theoretical analysis of light scattering from a layered metal-dielectric microsphere. The system
consists of two spherical resonators, coupled through concentric embedding. Solving for the modes of this system
we ﬁnd that near an avoided crossing the scattering cross section is dramatically suppressed, exhibiting a tunable
optical transparency. Similar to electromagnetically induced transparency, this phenomenon is associated with
a large group delay, which in our system is manifest as ﬂat azimuthal dispersion.

Nanostructured metallodielectric materials have been
extensively studied in recent years due to their promise
for new photonic device applications. This has led to the
emergence of the new ﬁeld of nano-plasmonics, which ad-
dresses the excitation and manipulation of surface plas-
mon polaritons (SPPs) in these systems.1 In particular,
metallodielectrics patterned periodically in three dimen-
sions (3D) exhibit novel dispersion characteristics which
rely on coherent scattering of SPPs ,2–4 potentially al-
lowing sub-wavelength manipulation of light signals.

An important geometry extensively addressed is that
of the 3D spherical plasmonic resonator. The latter con-
sists of a metal nanoshell surrounding a nanoscale dielec-
tric core, and may be designed to allow tuning of the SPP
ﬁeld distributions as well as its resonance.5 The large
plasmon ﬁelds in these systems have proven useful for
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.6 It has been re-
cently shown that concentric metal-dielectric shells sur-
rounding a meso-scale metal sphere (MDM resonators)
allow as much as an order of magnitude additional en-
hancement of the absorption cross section, while preserv-
ing the broad tunability of the composite resonance.7

In this Letter we analyze the greatly reduced scatte-
ring cross sections of meso-scale MDM particles. The use
of plasmonic coatings to reduce dipole scattering from
small spheres has been investigated.8 Here we use two-
band coupling formalism to show that electromagnetic
(EM) transparencies may be achieved in spheres of any
size. Our system consists of a micron-size metal sphere
of permittivity ǫm and radius R surrounded by one con-
centric sequence of dielectric (permittivity ǫd) and metal
(ǫm) shells of thicknesses L and T , respectively. The com-
posite particle is embedded in an isotropic and homo-
geneous dielectric host with permittivity ǫ0. We show
that with proper design of the metal-dielectric shells
it is possible to engineer the dispersion characteristics
of a MDM resonator such that the forward scattering
cross section is strongly suppressed, resulting in a tun-
able transparency. By solving the eigenvalue problem we
show that the observed transparency is associated with
an avoided crossing of the dominant plasmonic bands.

From Eq. (1) we immediately see that the resonances
of the MDM system may be expressed in terms of cou-
pled modes of the simpler resonators it is comprised
of, as anticipated.10 It is important to note here that
these eigenfrequencies are in general complex, due to
the radiative nature of the solutions.11 In the limit

Based on several published algorithms, we have de-
veloped an eﬃcient and stable method for calculating
the EM scattering amplitudes and their corresponding
coeﬃcients for a large sphere with arbitrary number of
alternating metal-dielectric layers.7 We use this to inves-
tigate the EM energy distributions in the MDM sphere,
as well as calculate its scattering cross section.

Using the procedure described above we obtain the
eigenfrequencies of the three following systems: a metal
sphere of radius W = 582 nm, an inﬁnite MDM with
metal core radius R = 500 nm and dielectric shell of
thickness L = 54 nm, and a MDM system, with same
core and dielectric shell dimensions as the inﬁnite MDM
and an ﬁnite outer metal shell of thickness T = 28 nm.
The thickness of the dielectric shell follows from the con-
dition for a ﬂat dispersion band,7 L
πc/(2ωsp√ǫd),
where ωsp, the surface plasmon frequency is given by
the resonance condition ǫm(ωsp) + ǫd = 0. In particu-
lar, we chose a silver–like Drude metal7 whose disper-
p(ω2 + iΓω)−1. Here
ω2
sion is given by ǫm(ω) = ǫb −
ǫb = 5.1 describes the contribution of interband transi-
tions, and ¯hωp = 9.1 eV with ωp the bulk plasma fre-
quency. The free electron relaxation rate is given by Γ,
where ¯hΓ = 0.021 eV. The dielectric shell is chosen to
be titania,12 which is well approximated by the non-
dispersive value of ǫd = 5.76. Both the metal sphere and
MDM are embedded in vacuum such that ǫ0 = 1.

In Fig. 1(a) we plot the eigenfrequencies for the TM
modes of the three geometries described above. The roots
of Eq. (1) are labelled by a band index n
0. The
dashed line labelled ESP denotes the ﬁrst band (n = 0)
of eigenfrequencies of the solid metal sphere obtained
from Eq. (2). The horizontal dashed line labelled ISP
denotes the second band modes of the inﬁnite MDM
(Eq. (3)). This band is obtained at the expected fre-
quency7 ωsp/ωp = (ǫb + ǫd)−1/2
0.3. The two bands
of solutions to Eq. (1) describing the MDM microsphere
are also plotted, denoted by the blue circles. These bands
correspond to n = 1 and n = 2. The n = 0 band of this
MDM (not plotted here) is at signiﬁcantly lower frequen-
cies, and hence does not couple to the higher order solu-
tions. The width of each resonance is given by a vertical
bar, equal in magnitude to twice the imaginary part of
the eigenvalue, while the central frequency marked by
the data points denotes its real part. The TE modes are
all of frequencies greater than ω/ωp = 0.4 and are there-
fore not plotted here. A well-resolved avoided crossing is
observed at ω/ωp = 0.284, a result of coupling between
the solid metal sphere and the inﬁnite MDM.

Figures 1(b)-(d) show grayscale plots of the near–ﬁeld
energy densities corresponding to three diﬀerent frequen-
cies in Fig. 1(a). In Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) we observe that

plots for the modes indicated by red circles in (a), at (b)
ω/ωp = 0.336, (c) ω/ωp = 0.294 and (d) ω/ωp = 0.233.

the ﬁeld energies of the low and high frequency modes are
concentrated at the outer metal shell, forming an exter-
nal surface plasmon (ESP) branch. For an intermediate
frequency value, close to ω/ωp = 0.284 Fig. 1(c) shows
the ﬁeld energy is concentrated at the interior shells’ in-
terfaces, thus belonging predominantly to an inner sur-
face plasmon (ISP) branch. These ESP and ISP branches
coincide with the uncoupled solutions to the solid metal
sphere and inﬁnite MDM, respectively, accurately de-
picting the EM energy distributions in these systems.
As we show below, suppression of the ESP in favor of
excitation of the ISP results in a dramatic reduction of
the MDM forward–scattering cross section.

In Fig. 2(a) we plot the scattering cross section, Csca
for the MDM described above. For comparison we also
plot Csca of the solid metal sphere discussed previously,
as well as that of a DMD. The latter consists of a dielec-
tric sphere surrounded by a metal shell, embedded in a
dielectric.5, 7 (It is not possible to compute Csca for the
inﬁnite MDM since it does not support outward prop-
agating solutions.) A large dip in Csca is observed at a
wavelength of λ = 463 nm, corresponding to strong sup-
pression of the forward–scattered ﬁelds.

Energy densities of the scattered ﬁelds are shown in
in Figs. 2(b)-(d), corresponding to circled wavelength
values in Fig. 2(a). As expected, in Fig. 2(c) we observe
strong suppression of the scattered ﬁeld at λ = 463 nm
(ω/ωp = 0.294) and the ISP nature of the ﬁelds is appar-
ent. This suppression is reminiscent of coupled-resonator
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).13 Here

Fig. 3. (color online) Tuning the scattering transparency
window with dielectric shell width, L. The MDM consists
of a silver core, R = 500 nm, a titania shell of variable
width L, and a silver shell of width T = 20 nm.

our calculated scattering minima also result in true
extinction transparencies in the far ﬁeld.

In summary, we have shown that coupling of inte-
rior and exterior surface plasmon modes in MDM micro-
spheres leads to resonant level splitting. This results in
strong suppression of the forward–scattering cross sec-
tion, to values much smaller than the geometric cross
section of the particle. This transparency is spectrally
tunable via the dielectric shell parameters. Such metal-
dielectric coatings may be utilized to signiﬁcantly reduce
the EM footprint of large, non-planar metallic objects.

too we see a transparency associated with large group de-
lay, albeit in the MDM it is azimuthal. Excitation of the
ISP also suggests that EIT-like dynamical damping is re-
sponsible for the transparency. At higher and lower ener-
gies, where ESP excitations prevail the forward-scattered
ﬁelds are signiﬁcant, as seen in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d). The
eﬀective scattering cross section at λ = 463 nm is equiva-
lent to that of a silver sphere 660 nm in diameter. Thus,
adding one dielectric-metal nanoshell sequence onto a
1 µm diameter silver sphere reduces its EM footprint to
that of a signiﬁcantly smaller particle.

We further ﬁnd that the scattering transparency may
be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the dielectric shell.
This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we plot the scattering
eﬃciency, Csca/πW 2 for several values of L. We use ex-
perimentally tabulated values for silver7 and amorphous
titania12 to model a R = 500 nm silver core with a metal
shell of ﬁxed thickness T . By varying the dielectric shell
thickness, L the transparency is tuned across the entire
visible spectrum. Figure 3 also shows the second–order
transparency window of each of these spheres, arising
from mode coupling in higher energy bands.

We note that the signiﬁcant quantity typically meas-
ured in the far ﬁeld is the extinction cross-section, de-
scribing the total energy removed from an incident plane
wave due to scattering and absorption.9 For the MDM
discussed here we have veriﬁed that the absorption peak
is always oﬀset in frequency from the transparency win-
dow, as well as being negligible compared to Csca. Thus

Abstract
A new formalism of beam-optics and polarization has been recently pre-
sented, based on an exact matrix representation of the Maxwell equations.
This is described in Part-I and Part-II. In this Part, we present the applica-
tion of the above formalism to the speciﬁc example of the axially symmetric
graded index ﬁber. This formalism leads to the wavelength-dependent mod-
iﬁcations of the six aberrations present in the traditional prescriptions and
further gives rise to the remaining three aberrations permitted by the axial
symmetry. Besides, it also gives rise to a wavelength-dependent image rota-
tion. The three extra aberrations and the image rotation are not found in
any of the traditional approaches.

1 Introduction

In Part-I and Part-II we presented the exact matrix representation of the
Maxwell equations in a medium with varying permittivity and permeabil-
ity [1, 2]. From this we derived an exact optical Hamiltonian, which was
shown to be in close algebraic analogy with the Dirac equation. This enabled
us to apply the machinery of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation and we
obtained an expansion for the beam-optical Hamiltonian which works to all
orders. Formal expressions were obtained for the paraxial Hamiltonian and
the leading order aberrating Hamiltonian, without assuming any form for
the refractive index. Even at the paraxial level the wavelength-dependent
eﬀects manifest by the presence of a matrix term coupled to the logarithmic
gradient of the refractive index. This matrix term is very similar to the spin

term in the Dirac equation and we call it as the polarizing term in our formal-
ism. The aberrating Hamiltonian contains numerous wavelength-dependent
terms in two guises: One of these is the explicit wavelength-dependent terms
coming from the commutators inbuilt in the formalism with ¯λ playing the
role played by ¯h in quantum mechanics. The other set arises from the the
polarizing term.

Now, we apply the formalism to speciﬁc examples. One is the medium
with constant refractive index. This is perhaps the only problem which can
be solved exactly in a closed form expression. This is just to illustrate how
the aberration expansion in our formalism can be summed to give the familiar
exact result.

The next example is that of the axially symmetric graded index medium.
This example enables us to demonstrate the power of the formalism, repro-
ducing the familiar results from the traditional approaches and further giving
rise to new results, dependent on the wavelength.

2 Medium with Constant Refractive Index

Constant refractive index is the simplest possible system. In our formalism,
this is perhaps the only case where it is possible to do an exact diagonal-
ization. This is very similar to the exact diagonalization of the free Dirac
Hamiltonian. From the experience of the Dirac theory we know that there
are hardly any situations where one can do the exact diagonalization. One
necessarily has to resort to some approximate diagonalization procedure.
The Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation scheme provides the most convenient
and accurate diagonalization to any desired degree of accuracy. So we have
adopted the Foldy-Wouthuysen scheme in our formalism.

For a medium with constant refractive index, n (r) = nc, we have,

ˆHc =

3 Axially Symmetric Graded Index Medium

The refractive index of an axially symmetric graded-index material can be
most generally described by the following polynomial (see, pp. 117 in [4])

where [A, B] = (AB + BA) and ‘
’ are the numerous other terms arising
from the polarization term. We have retained only the leading order of
such terms above for an illustration. All these matrix terms, related to the
polarization will be addressed elsewhere.

The reasons for partitioning the beam-optical Hamiltonian ˆ
H

in the above
manner are as follows. The paraxial Hamiltonian, ˆH0 ,p, describes the ideal
behaviour. ˆH0 ,(4) is responsible for the third-order aberrations. Both of these
Hamiltonians are modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contributions given
0 ,(2) and ˆH (¯λ)
in ˆH (¯λ)
0 ,(4) respectively. Lastly, we have ˆH (¯λ,σ), which is associated
with the polarization.

From these sub-Hamiltonians we make several observations: The term
α2(z) ˆLz which contributes to the paraxial Hamiltonian, gives rise to an

image rotation by an angle θ(z):

This image rotation (which need not be small) has no analogue in the square-
root approach [4, 5] and the scalar approach [6, 7].

The Hamiltonian ˆH0 ,(4) is the one we have in the traditional prescriptions
and is responsible for the six aberrations. ˆH (¯λ)
0 ,(4) modiﬁes the above six aber-
rations by wavelength-dependent contributions and further gives rise to the
remaining three aberrations permitted by the axial symmetry. Before pro-
ceeding further we enumerate all the nine aberrations permitted by the axial
symmetry. The axial symmetry permits exactly nine third-order aberrations

Thus we see that the current approach gives rise to all the nine permissible
aberrations. The six aberrations, familiar from the traditional prescriptions
get modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contributions. The extra three
(k, a and d are all anisotropic!) are all pure wavelength-dependent aber-
rations and totally absent in the traditional square-root approach [4, 5] and
the recently developed scalar approach [6, 7]. A detailed account on the
classiﬁcation of aberrations is available in [9]-[12].

4 Conclusions

In Part-I and Part-II, we developed an exact matrix representation of the
Maxwell equations which became the basis for an exact formalism of Maxwell
optics. An exact optical Hamiltonian, with an algebraic structure in direct
correspondence with the Dirac equation of the electron was derived. Then
following a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique, a procedure was
developed to obtain the beam optical Hamiltonians to any desired degree
of accuracy. Formal expressions were obtained for the paraxial and leading

9

order aberrating Hamiltonians, without making any assumption on the form
of the refractive index. In this Part we look at the applications of the above
formalism.

First of the two examples is the medium with a constant refractive index.
This is perhaps the only problem which can be solved exactly, in a closed
form expression. This example is primarily for illustrating certain aspects of
the machinery we have used.

The second, and the more interesting example is that of the axially sym-
metric graded index medium. For this example, in the traditional approaches
one gets only six aberrations. In our formalism we get all the nine aberra-
tions permitted by the axial symmetry. The six aberration coeﬃcients of the
traditional approaches get modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contribu-
tions.

It is very interesting to note that apart from the wavelength-dependent
modiﬁcations of the aberrations, this approach also gives rise to the image
rotation. This image rotation is proportional to the wavelength and we have
derived an explicit relationship for the angle in (18). Such, an image rotation
has no analogue/counterpart in any of the traditional prescriptions. It would
be worthwhile to experimentally look for the predicted image rotation. The
existence of the nine aberrations and image rotation are well-known in axi-
ally symmetric magnetic electron lenses, even when treated classically. The
quantum treatment of the same system leads to the wavelength-dependent
modiﬁcations [13].

The optical Hamiltonian has two components: Beam-Optics and Polar-
ization. We have addressed the former in some detail and shall do the later
soon. The formalism initiated in this article provides a natural framework
for the study of light polarization. This would provide a uniﬁed treatment
for the beam-optics and the polarization. It also promises a possible gen-
eralization of the substitution result in [16]. We shall present this approach
soon [17].

The close analogy between geometrical optics and charged-particle has
been known for too long a time. Until recently it was possible to see this
analogy only between the geometrical optics and classical prescriptions of
charge-particle optics. A quantum theory of charged-particle optics was pre-
sented in recent years [18, 19, 20, 13]. With the current development of the
non-traditional prescriptions of Helmholtz optics [6, 7] and the matrix for-
mulation of Maxwell optics (in these three Parts), using the rich algebraic

10

machinery of quantum mechanics it is now possible to see a parallel of the
analogy at each level. The non-traditional prescription of the Helmholtz op-
tics is in close analogy with the quantum theory of charged-particles based on
the Klein-Gordon equation. The matrix formulation of Maxwell optics pre-
sented here is in close analogy with the quantum theory of charged-particles
based on the Dirac equation. We shall narrate and examine the parallel of
these analogies soon [21].

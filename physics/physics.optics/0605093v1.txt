Abstract

On the basis of angular spectrum representation, a formalism describing paraxial beams propa-

gating through an isotropic left-handed material (LHM) slab is presented. The treatment allows

us to introduce the ideas of beam focusing and phase compensation by LHM slab. Because of the

negative refractive index of LHM slab, the inverse Gouy phase shift and the negative Rayleigh

length of paraxial Gaussian beam are proposed. It is shown that the phase diﬀerence caused by

the Gouy phase shift in right-handed material (RHM) can be compensated by that caused by the

inverse Gouy phase shift in LHM. If certain matching conditions are satisﬁed, the intensity and

phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image plane.

INTRODUCTION

In the late 1960s, Veselago ﬁrstly introduced the concept of left-handed material (LHM)

in which both the permittivity ε and the permeability µ are negative [1]. Veselago predicted

that electromagnetic waves incident on a planar interface between a right-handed material

(RHM) and a LHM will undergo negative refraction. Theoretically, a LHM planar slab can

act as a lens and focus waves from a point source. Experimentally, the negative refraction

has been observed by using periodic wires and rings structure [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In the past few

years, negative refractions in photonic crystals [7, 8, 9, 10] and anisotropic metamaterials [11,

12, 13, 14, 15] have also been reported.

Recently, Pendry extended Veslago’s analysis and further predicted that a LHM slab can

amplify evanescent waves and thus behaves like a perfect lens [16]. It is well known that

in a conventional imaging system the evanescent waves are drastically decayed before they

reach the image plane. While in a LHM slab system, both the phases of propagating waves

and the amplitudes of evanescent waves from a near-ﬁeld object could be restored at its

image. Therefore, the spatial resolution of the superlens can overcome the diﬀraction limit

of conventional imaging systems and reach the subwavelength scale. While great research

interests were initiated by the revolutionary concept [17, 18, 19, 20], hot debates were also

raised [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

The main purpose of the present work is to investigate the paraxial beams propagating

through an isotropic LHM slab. Starting from the representation of plane-wave angular

spectrum, we derive the propagation of paraxial beams in RHM and LHM. Our formalism

permits us to introduce ideas for beam focusing and phase compensation of paraxial beams

by using LHM slab. Because of the negative refractive index, the inverse Gouy phase shift

and negative Rayleigh length in LHM slab are proposed. As an example, we obtain the

analytical description for a Gaussian beam propagating through a LHM slab. We ﬁnd that

the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in RHM can be compensated by that

caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in LHM.

II. THE PARAXIAL MODEL OF BEAM PROPAGATION

In this section, we present a brief derivation on paraxial model in RHM and LHM.

Following the standard procedure, we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld

iωt)] and B(r, t) = Re[B(r) exp(

iωt)] of angular frequency ω

One can easily ﬁnd that the wave propagation is only permitted in the medium with ε, µ > 0

or ε, µ < 0. In the former case, E, H and k form a right-handed triplet, while in the latter

case, E, H and k form a left-handed triplet. The previous Maxwell equations can be

combined straightforwardly to obtain the well-known equation for the complex amplitude

of the electric ﬁeld in RHM or LHM

where k = nR,Lω/c, c is the speed of light in vacuum, nR = √εRµR and nL =

Equation (2) can be conveniently solved by employing the Fourier transformations, so

the complex amplitude in RHM and LHM can be conveniently expressed as

which is a standard two-dimensional Fourier transform [29]. In fact, after the electric ﬁeld

on the plane z = 0 is known, Eq. (3) together with Eq. (4) provides the expression of the

ﬁeld in the space z > 0.

From a mathematical point of view, the approximate paraxial expression for the ﬁeld can

be obtained by the expansion of the square root of kz to the ﬁrst order in

III. THE PROPAGATION OF PARAXIAL GAUSSIAN BEAM

The previous section outlined the paraxial model for general laser beams propagating in

RHM and LHM. In this section we shall investigate the analytical description for a beam with

a boundary Gaussian distribution. This example allows us to describe the new features of

beam propagation in LHM slab. As shown in Fig. 1, the LHM slab in region 2 is surrounded

by the usual RHM in region 1 and region 3. The beam will pass the interfaces z = a and

z = a + d before it reaches the image plane z = a + b + d. To be uniform throughout the
following analysis, we introduce diﬀerent coordinate transformations z∗

i (i = 1, 2, 3) in the

three regions, respectively.

First we want to explore the ﬁeld in region 1. Without any loss of generality, we assume

that the input waist locates at the object plane z = 0. The fundamental Gaussian spectrum

distribution can be written in the form

E1(k⊥) =

w0

where w0 is the spot size. By substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (5), the ﬁeld in the region 1 can

be written as

We are now in a position to calculate the ﬁeld in region 2. In fact, the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst

boundary can be easily obtained from Eq. (9) by choosing z = a. Substituting the ﬁeld into

Eq. (4), the angular spectrum distribution can be obtained as

We note two interesting features of the paraxial ﬁeld in LHM: First, because of the

negative index of refraction, the inverse Gouy phase shift and negative Rayleigh length

should be introduced. Second, the beams can be focused by LHM slab and the focusing

waists remain w0. For the purpose of illustration, the relevant focusing feature is shown in

Fig. 2. We ﬁnd that the place of focusing waist could be diﬀerent which depends on the

choice of the refractive index.

Finally we want to study the ﬁeld in region 3. The ﬁeld in the second boundary can be

easily obtained from Eq. (14) under choosing z = a + d. Substituting the ﬁeld into Eq. (4),

To this end, the ﬁelds are determined explicitly in the three regions. Comparing Eq. (14),

Eq. (19) with Eq. (9) show that the ﬁeld distributions in region 2 and region 3 still remain

Gaussian. For the purpose of illustration, the spatial map of the electric ﬁelds is plotted in

Fig. 3. We can easily ﬁnd that there exists an internal and an external focus.

IV. BEAM FOCUSING AND PHASE COMPENSATION

In this section we examine the matching conditions of beam focusing and phase compen-

sation. First we want to explore the matching condition of focusing. We can easily ﬁnd the
place of the focusing waist by choosing z∗
at plane z = 0. After setting z∗

i = 0. We assume the incident beam waist locates

2 = 0 in Eq. (16), we get the ﬁrst focusing waist in LHM slab
nL/nR)a. Then we substitute z∗

3 = 0 into Eq. (16), we can

locates at the plane z = (1

−

ﬁnd the second focusing waist in region 3 locates at the plane z = (1

nR/nL)d. We take

the image position z = a + d + b to be the place of the second focusing waist. Using this

criterion, the matching condition for focusing can be written as

nL(a + b) + nRd = 0.

(23)

In addition, the thickness of the LHM slab should satisfy the relation d >

anL/nR, other-

wise there is neither an internal nor an external focus.

Next we attempt to investigate the matching condition for phase compensation.

It is

known that an electromagnetic beam propagating through a focus experiences an additional

π phase shift with respect to a plane wave. This phase anomaly was discovered by Gouy in

1890 and has since been referred to as the Gouy phase shift [32, 33]. It should be mentioned

−

−

8

that there exists an eﬀect of accumulated Gouy phase shift when a beam passing through

an optical system with positive index [34, 35, 36]. While in the LHM slab system we expect

that the phase diﬀerence caused by Gouy phase shift can be compensated by that caused

by the inverse Gouy shift in LHM. In Fig. 4, we plot the distribution of phase fronts in the

three regions. The phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in the three regions are

given by

The ﬁrst and third Equations dictate the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy shift in region

1 and region 3, respectively. The second equation denotes the phase diﬀerence caused by

the inverse Gouy phase shift in LHM slab. Subsequent calculations of Eq. (24) show

−

This means that the phase diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in RHM can be

compensated by that caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in LHM slab. Therefore the

condition for phase compensation can be simply written as

nRk0a + nRk0b + nLk0d = 0.

(26)

The ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (26) are the phase deference caused by the plane wave in RHM.

The last term in Eq. (26) is the phase deference caused by the plane wave in LHM slab.

Finally we discuss the phase diﬀerence caused by the radial phase. Following the method

outlined by Dumelow et al. [20], we assume that the beam waist locates at the object plane.

Then we take the image position to be that where the intensity is a maximum. Evidently,

from Eqs. (19)-(22) we can ﬁnd that the intensity maximum locates at the plane of beam

waist. The phase diﬀerence between the object plane and the image plane is independent

of radial position, since the phase fronts are ﬂat there.

The new message in this paper is to prove that the intensity and phase distributions at

object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image plane by LHM slab. Now an

interesting question naturally arises: whether the matching conditions of focusing and the

9

phase compensation can be satisﬁed simultaneously. From Eqs. (23)-(26) one can easily ﬁnd

that the refractive index, a, b and d should satisfy the matching conditions:

nL =

nR,

a + b = d.

−

(27)

Under the matching conditions, the reﬂected waves at the interface between RHM and LHM

are completely absent. Therefore the intensity and phase distributions at the object plane

can be completely reconstructed at the image plane.

Note that the purpose of this paper is to examine beam focusing and phase compensation

in paraxial regime. The evanescent waves which are claimed to provide the subwavelength

imaging do not correspond to the problem under study. The paraxial model only deals

with beams whose transverse dimension is much larger than a wavelength. However, in the

subwavelength focusing regime a rigorous diﬀraction theory should be developed.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have investigated the focusing and phase compensation of paraxial

beams by an isotropic LHM slab. We have introduced the concepts of inverse Gouy phase

shift and negative Rayleigh length of paraxial beams in LHM. We have shown that the phase

diﬀerence caused by the Gouy phase shift in RHM can be compensated by that caused by

the inverse Gouy phase shift in LHM slab. If certain matching conditions are satisﬁed, the

intensity and phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at the

image plane. We expect many potential devices can be constructed based on the paraxial

beam model discussed above. They can, for example, be used to provide beam focusing,

phase compensation and image transfer.

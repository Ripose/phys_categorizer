INTRODUCTION

Well-known achievements in atomic physics of the last two decades became possible due

to the progress in the semiconductor diode lasers. External cavity diode lasers (ECDL) are

the most important in this context. They are able to produce powerful coherent radiation

in the vicinity of many important atomic resonances. Details of various diode laser designs

and laser performance are described in a number of papers, see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Most popular arrangement of an external cavity of a diode laser is based on the grating

feedback in the Littrow conﬁguration, Fig. 1. In such resonator, the grating reﬂects back to

the diode the radiation in non-zero diﬀraction order. The laser output coupling is performed

through zero diﬀraction order of the grating. Although such resonator conﬁguration looks

the simplest possible there are some inconveniences in its practical realization. In the present

paper we describe a modiﬁed diode laser resonator that is more eﬃcient and convenient. This

approach to the laser wavelength selection by grating is based on our previous experience

with dye lasers [6]. Another source of helpful ideas for this work was an excellent monograph

[7] devoted to the classical spectral instruments.

LITTROW RESONATOR

Performance of the laser having Littrow resonator (Fig. 1) is determined by the three

major factors: grating angular dispersion, grating reﬂection coeﬃcient and output coupling

coeﬃcient. The grating formula for the Littrow conﬁguration,

allows to deduce the angular dispersion, D, of the grating,

2d sin θ = mλ,

D ≡

dθ
dλ

=

m
2d cos θ

.

(1)

(2)

Here, d is the distance between two neighbouring groves of the grating, m is the diﬀraction

order. From this expression one can conclude that the angular dispersion, D, is growing if

d is decreasing. It motivates ones to use in most designs of the laser external cavities the

gratings having large density of groves.

One can modify the expression (2) for D by substituting the diﬀraction order m from the

2

grating formula (1) and obtain,

D = λ−1 tan θ.

(3)

This equation shows that the angular dispersion of the grating and consequently the fre-

quency resolution do not depend on the density of groves if one works at predeﬁned diﬀraction

angle θ. This conclusion allows to make an important simpliﬁcation of the design by using

cheaper and better quality gratings having low density of groves.

Another conclusion from Eq. (3) is that the angular dispersion is larger at larger diﬀrac-

tion angles θ. The drawback of working at large θ is that for an ordinary ﬂat grating the

reﬂection coeﬃcient decreases at large θ. One knows (see, e.g., [7]) that the reﬂection at

large diﬀraction angles can be increased by using the gratings having the groves of triangular

shape that increases the grating blazing angle. Consequently, the gratings having low den-

sity of groves have an additional advantage because for such gratings a modern technology

gives better quality of groves.

V-SHAPE RESONATOR

Another important parameter determined laser performance is the magnitude of the

resonator output coupling. Optimal output coupling is a complicated function of the laser

medium gain, resonator losses and power saturation mechanism. In practice, one uses to try

a few output couplers to ﬁnd out the right one for better laser performance. For the Littrow

resonator in Fig. 1 the output coupling is determined by the properties of particular grating

and cannot be changed by will.

One way to solve this problem is to use an extra reﬂector inside a Littrow resonator [1].

We propose here to use an output coupling mirror in a V-shape resonator, Fig. 2.

The grating used in this work had 600 groves/mm and the blazing angle equal ≃ 300

speciﬁed by the manufacturer. This blazing angle is determined by the orientation of the

main surface of the grove (see insert in Fig. 2). This surface of the grove would allow us to
work at the diﬀraction angles θ ≃ 300. Technology of the grating production is such that

the groves have a triangular shape and one can use another surface of the grove to work at
much larger blazing angle [7]. In our case it allows us to work at the blazing angle, θ = 690,

that corresponds to the 4-th diﬀraction order for λ = 0.78 µ. Reﬂection coeﬃcient of our
grating in the 4-th order was ≃ 60%. The reﬂection coeﬃcient in the 0-th order at θ = 690

3

appeared to be very low, ∼ 1%. In fact, this circumstance has motivated us to modify the

usual Littrow resonator.

We have used standard Mitsubishi laser diode, ML6XX24 series, without a special antire-

ﬂection coating on the crystal facet. Concequently, the laser resonator consists of the two,

one is formed by the diode crystal itself and another is formed by the external resonator.

Fine tuning of the laser frequency needs in this case simultaneous tuning of these two res-

onators to avoid nonlinearities due to the frequency pulling eﬀect. It was performed in our

laser by synchronous linear modulation of the diode current and the grating tilting by piezo

transducer. The length of the external resonator was equal to 3.5 cm.

Stable laser characteristics demands rather precise temperature stabilization of the laser

diode. It was done in the setup with the help of Peltier element and feedback electronics.

The temperature stability was better than 1 mK. The external laser resonator was not

temperature stabilized actively. Instead, it was placed on aluminium plate that had good

thermal contact with the massive metal optical table.

LASER PERFORMANCE

The speciﬁed wavelength of the laser diode was 785 nm at 25 C. In the experiments

with the rubidium vapour the laser diode was kept at 14 C and its own frequency at such

temperature was ≃ 781 nm. Power of the laser diode itself (without an external resonator)

was 35 mW at the electrical current through the diode equal 72 mA and the temperature

equal 14 C.

The laser produces two beams (Fig. 2). Direction of the main beam does not depend

on the grating and mirror orientation. Direction of the second beam changes if the laser

wavelength is tuned like it does in the Littrow resonator. Power of the external cavity diode

laser having the ﬂat output coupling mirror T = 45% was 18 mW, combined from 14 mW of

the main output beam and 4 mW of the second beam. The output coupling mirror having

T ≃ 60% gives 21 mW in the main beam and 3 mW in the second beam. Thus, as one would

expect, an adjustment of the output coupling mirror is signiﬁcant for the laser performance.

For the V-shape resonator such adjustment appears to be rather simple procedure.

The laser frequency characteristics were measured using the setup shown in Fig. 3. The

wavelength of the laser radiation was controlled by the spectrograph having the dispersion

4

equal 0.36 nm/cm on the TV screen and precise λ–meter having sensitivity equal 50 MHz.

Rough frequency tuning of the laser radiation was performed by rotating the mirror that

was placed on the tuning head. For the output coupling mirror having T = 45% the laser

wavelength was tuned between 775-785 nm at a constant diode temperature equal 14 C.

The range of the laser frequency tuning decreases if one uses output coupling mirror having

larger transmission.

Fine frequency of the laser radiation was performed by simultaneous tilting the grating

and linear modulation of the diode electrical current. Frequency tuning was tested by

measuring the linear transmission spectra of Rb vapour. For this purpose a weak laser beam

passed through a 7.5 cm cell containing Rb vapour at room temperature. The cell contained

natural mixture of Rb isotopes and no buﬀer gas. (The strong counter propagating beam

(Fig. 3) was closed in this measurements.) The data are presented in Fig. 4a. This spectrum

is the average of 16 frequency scans taken during ≃ 1 s. This result shows that the range

of the laser frequency ﬁne tuning is larger than 9 GHz. Small decrease of the laser power

visible in the Fig. 4a is due to the diode current modulation mentioned above.

One can compare the measured transmission spectra with the calculated spectrum. The
calculation was done using the hyperﬁne parameters of the 87Rb and 85Rb isotopes from [8]
and the decay rate of the 2P3/2 state equal 6 MHz [9]. As an example, the level structure
of 87Rb is shown in Fig. 5. The calculated transmission spectra is shown in Fig. 4b. The

measured transmission is reproduced by the calculations within 5% if one uses the Rb vapour

pressure from [10]. The vapour pressure from [11] needs ≃20% increase.

Passive stability of the laser frequency was measured by the two methods. In the ﬁrst,

the transmitted radiation intensity in the vicinity of Rb absorption lines was observed. The

laser frequency drift appeared to be ≃12 MHz/min during in approximately 20 min. Another

measurement was done with the help of the λ-meter. It gives similar value for the frequency

drift, 15 MHz/min, for the 20 min observation period.

An important parameter of the laser is the radiation linewidth.

It can be measured

studying the beats of two independent lasers. We have estimated the radiation linewidth

using the saturated absorption resonances in Rb vapour. For this, the transmission of weak

laser beam was measured in the presence of strong counterpropagating laser beam. The

spectra are presented in Fig. 4c and in a larger scale in Fig. 6. These spectra are an

average of 16 tracks taken during ≃1 s. The width (HWHM) of the nonlinear resonance

5

Fg = 2 −→ Fe = 3 appears to be equal ≃ 15 MHz. This width is composed [12] from the

ﬂuorescence linewidth (3 MHz for our transition [9]), the width of the Bennett peak in the

velocity distribution in the upper state, estimated as 11 MHz for the strong beam intensity

used in the experiment and the laser frequency linewidth. From these data one can estimate

that the laser radiation linewidth is on the order of 1 MHz.

CONCLUSIONS

The diode laser having V-shape external cavity is described. The external cavity is a

Littrow resonator modiﬁed by an additional output coupling mirror. This mirror allows

easily adjust the level of the laser output coupling and thus optimize the laser performance,

obtaining necessary frequency tuning range, or necessary output power. In the described

laser the radiation power constitutes ≃50% of the laser power without an external resonator.

The ﬁne frequency tuning range of the laser is ≥9 GHz and the radiation linewidth is

estimated as being on the order of 1 MHz.

Proposed V-shape external resonator has some advantages in comparison with the tra-

ditional Littrow resonator. It is easier now to optimize the diﬀraction grating that has to

have just maximal possible reﬂection coeﬃcient. Another advantage is that the direction of

the main output beam is unaﬀected by the laser frequency tuning.

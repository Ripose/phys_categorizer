High refractive index contrast optical microdisk resonators fabricated from silicon-on-insulator
wafers are studied using an external silica ﬁber taper waveguide as a wafer-scale optical probe.
Measurements performed in the 1500 nm wavelength band show that these silicon microdisks can
support whispering-gallery modes with quality factors as high as 5.2 × 105, limited by Rayleigh
scattering from fabrication induced surface roughness. Microdisks with radii as small as 2.5 µm are
studied, with measured quality factors as high as 4.7 × 105 for an optical mode volume of 5.3(λ/n)3.

PACS numbers: 42.60.Da, 42.81.Qb

Recent studies of optical resonators in glass based
microspheres[1, 2, 3], microrings[4], and microtoroids[5]
have highlighted the applications aﬀorded by the ex-
tremely long photon lifetime of whispering-gallery-modes
(WGMs) supported by these structures. Furthermore,
recent work by Ilchenko et al. illustrated the advantages
of creating WGMs in crystalline materials[6]. Applica-
tions for such devices include quantum networking[7],
low threshold non-linear optical sources[8], and compact
micro-optical circuits[4]. The ability to create similar
high quality factor (Q) WGM resonators in III-V or sil-
icon (Si) semiconductors has thus far been hampered by
the large refractive index of most semiconductors and the
resulting sensitivity to surface roughness[9, 10]. In this
Letter we describe measurements of micron-sized Si mi-
crodisk resonators supporting transverse-magnetic (TM)
WGMs with signiﬁcantly reduced sensitivity to disk-edge
roughness. These modes have measured Q values as high
105 and eﬀective modal volumes (Veﬀ) as small as
as 5.2
5.3 cubic wavelengths in the material. The largest Q/Veﬀ
104, greater than the val-
ratio is measured to be 8.8

ues measured in ultra-small volume photonic crystals[11]
and comparable to the values measured in ultra-high-Q
microspheres and microtoroids[1, 5, 6].

The silicon microdisks in this work are fabricated
from a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer consisting of a
344 nm thick p-doped Si layer of resistivity 1-3 Ω-cm
atop a two micron SiO2 layer. Processing of the mi-
crodisks begins with the deposition of a 20 nm SiO2
protective cap layer using plasma-enhanced chemical-
vapor-deposition. Electron beam lithography is used
to create a polymer resist etch mask, and a low-
bias voltage inductively-coupled-plasma reactive-ion-etch
with SF6:C4F8 gas chemistry[11] then transfers the cir-
cular microdisk pattern into the top Si layer. After dry-
etching, the sample is immersed in buﬀered hydroﬂuoric
acid to undercut the bottom SiO2 cladding, as shown in
Figure 1. The thin 20 nm SiO2 top cap layer is also re-
moved in this process, providing a clean, smooth top Si
surface. A ﬁnal rinse in deionized water is performed,
followed by a high-purity nitrogen spray drying step.

In order to characterize the microdisk resonators,

is
taper
an evanescent ﬁber
employed[11]. In this process, an optical ﬁber is adiabat-
ically drawn to a 1-2 µm diameter so that its evanescent
ﬁeld is made accessible to the environment. In this work,
the ﬁber taper is positioned to the side of the microdisks,
with a center height equal to that of the middle of the
microdisk. Measurements of the taper transmission as a
function of the lateral taper-microdisk gap (g) are then
performed using a swept wavelength tunable laser source
(λ = 1509-1625 nm) with ﬁne frequency resolution of 10
MHz. A set of paddle wheels are used to adjust the po-
larization state of the ﬁber taper mode in the microdisk
coupling region, providing selective coupling to the TE-
like (TM-like) WGMs with dominant electric ﬁeld paral-
lel (normal) to the plane of the microdisk. For the 344
nm Si layer thickness of the microdisks studied here, only
the fundamental vertical slab mode for TE and TM po-
larization are strongly guided. As such, we only consider
the fundamental vertical modes of the microdisks in what
follows, labeling them simply by pm,n, where p is either
TE or TM, and m and n are the characteristic radial and
azimuthal number, respectively[12].

Microdisks of two diﬀerent sizes, radius R = 2.5 and
4.5 µm, are fabricated and tested. A broad wavelength
scan covering the 1509-1625 nm wavelength range is
initially employed to map out the diﬀerent microdisk
modes. As will be detailed elsewhere[13], the adjustable
polarization state in the taper along with the WGMs’
strength of coupling and linewidth is used to determine
sets of modes with a common free spectral range. These
measurements provided a reliable determination of ra-
dial mode number. An eﬀective index two-dimensional
model is then used to estimate the azimuthal number.
Using this mode identiﬁcation technique we found that
the highest Q modes in both sizes of microdisks are con-
sistently of TM polarization, and corresponded to the
1.
lowest radial number, n

The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the evanescent coupling to
a TM44,1 WGM of a R = 4.5 µm microdisk, with tapered
ﬁber positioned 1.1 µm laterally from the disk edge. The
observed double resonance dip (doublet) is a result of
Rayleigh scattering from disk surface roughness as dis-

cussed below, which lifts the degeneracy of clockwise
(cw) and counter-clockwise (ccw) propagating WGMs in
the microdisk[2]. Fitting the shorter wavelength mode
of the doublet to a Lorentzian yields a loaded linewidth
of 3.9 pm with a 5% coupling depth. These measure-
ments are repeated for varying taper-microdisk gaps and
are recorded in Figure 2(a,b). For g > 0.63 µm, the data
follows a two-port coupled mode theory with simple ex-
ponential loading dependence on taper-microdisk gap[3].
Fits based upon this model are shown as a solid line in
each of the plots of Fig. 2. The ﬁber loading of the mi-
crodisk is characterized here by a dimensionless eﬀective
quality factor, Qﬁber (inset to Fig. 2(b)). The asymptotic
unloaded linewidth is found to be 3.0 pm for this WGM,
105. The ob-
corresponding to a bare-cavity Q of 5.2
served non-exponential loading dependence for small g is
due to the large phase mismatch between the glass ﬁber

microdisk sizes, and a summary of the measured bare-
cavity Q and doublet mode-splitting values are given in

anisms and the observed trend of Q with polarization
and radial mode number, a complementary theoretical

analysis is also performed. Both the radiation limited
Q (& 1015[14]) and the free carrier absorption Q of the
p-doped Si disk layer (estimated to be > 107 from Ref.
[15]), are far greater than the measured Q values. Sur-
face state absorption is another possible loss mechanism;
however, several trials are performed with diﬀering ﬁ-
nal chemical cleaning steps with no perceivable change
in Q. The rather large measured splitting of the cw
and ccw traveling wave modes indicates strong surface
scattering[16], and therefore we believe the dominant
source of optical loss to be scattering from index per-
turbations at the microdisk surface.

Surface roughness on the top and bottom surfaces of
the microdisks analyzed in this work is negligible in com-
parison to the azimuthal variation of the disk radius
[Fig. 1(c)], a result of mask erosion and deformation
during the dry etching step. For this type of rough-
ness, the index perturbation can be approximated by

disk height, and ∆r(s) is the radial surface roughness rel-
ative to the unperturbed disk radius[17]. The parameters
r, s, and z correspond to the radius from the disk center,
arc length along the disk perimeter, and height along the
disk edge, respectively. These perturbations of the disk
radius set up polarization currents, ~J =
iωoδǫ ~E, which
couple the WGMs of the perfect microdisk to radiation
modes or other nearly resonant WGMs. The Volume
Current Method[18] can be used to calculate the radi-
ated power into free space from ~J, providing an estimate
for the surface-scattering quality factor, Qss. In the limit
that the correlation length of the roughness (Lc) is much
smaller than the wavelength in the material,

which edge contours with near nanometer resolution can
be obtained [Fig. 1(d)]. From a Gaussian ﬁt to the auto-
correlation function of the surface roughness [Fig. 1(e)],
estimates for σr and Lc are found to be 2.8 nm and 40 nm,
respectively, typical of the fabricated microdisks in this
work. Using the results from this roughness analysis in
Eqs. (1) and (2), theoretical estimates for Q and ∆λ±m
are calculated and tabulated in Table I, with good agree-
ment found between theory and the measured microdisk
properties. In these calculations, an eﬀective index model
[12] is used to estimate ¯us(ˆe) and the ef-
based on Ref.
fective mode volume Veﬀ[19], with the approximate TM
modes given by a single ˆz ﬁeld component and the TE
modes consisting of ˆr and ˆφ electric ﬁeld components.
The salient result of this analysis is that a TE mode has
roughly three times the radiated power versus a compa-
rable TM mode. This is explained by the fact that both
the ˆr and ˆφ components couple to radiation modes more
strongly than the ˆz component of the ﬁeld. The modes
of higher n number are also measured and found to be
lower Q as predicted by the disk-edge surface-scattering
theory, although for n > 2 the eﬀects of the underlying
SiO2 pedestal may be signiﬁcant.

In summary, Si microdisks of a few microns in radius
105. In con-
have been fabricated with measured Q > 5
trast to theoretical predictions for an ideal microdisk, we
ﬁnd that the TM modes have signiﬁcantly higher mea-
sured Q values than TE modes due to their inherent
reduced sensitivity to disk-edge surface roughness.
In
comparison to previously measured high-Q semiconduc-
tor microdisks [9], the Q of the smallest WGMs measured
in this work are > 20 times larger while maintaining a
similar eﬀective mode volume.

We study nonlinear transmission of an asymmetric multilayer structure created by alternating
slabs of two materials with positive and negative refractive index. We demonstrate that such a
structure exhibits passive spatially nonreciprocal transmission of electromagnetic waves, the ana-
logue of the electronic diode. We study the properties of this left-handed diode and conﬁrm its
highly nonreciprocal and bistable transmittance by employing direct simulations.

mission is 100% in the forward propagation, whereas
it is much smaller or vanishes for backward (opposite)
propagation, yielding a unitary contrast. The possibility
of achieving highly nonreciprocal transmission through
a passive, nonlinear device is not only novel and in-
teresting concept, but also useful
for many applica-
tions such as optical isolation and all-optical process-
ing. Such unidirectional action was demonstrated for sev-
eral asymmetric structures and diﬀerent nonlinear mate-
rials [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

In this paper, we discuss a novel type of spatially non-
reciprocal device based on an asymmetric multilayered
structure created by alternating slabs of two materials,
conventional and left-handed (LH), the latter is a mate-
rial with both negative electric permittivity and negative
magnetic permeability which results in an eﬀective neg-
ative refractive index [8]. Such multilayered structures
are a special class of structures consiting of a sequence
of ﬂat lenses that provide optical cancellation of the con-
ventional, or right-handed (RH), layers leading to either
enhanced or suppressed transmission [9, 10, 11].

We employ a general idea to obtain diode action by
making the structure both asymmetric and nonlinear.
Also, we consider a periodic superlattice, which is ex-
pected to possess resonant properties, and thus enhanc-
ing nonlinear eﬀects. We consider an asymmetric super-
lattice consisting of three stacks with four LH/RH dou-
ble layers each [see Figs. 1(a,b)]. We assume that in the
nonlinear regime, a dielectric defect layer with Kerr-type
nonlinear response is inserted between stacks 1 and 2,
as shown in Fig. 1(b). We study wave transmission in
both linear and nonlinear regimes by using the transfer-
matrix method (TMM) [12], and also by employing direct
numerical simulations based on the pseudospectral time-
domain (PSTD) method [13]. The transfer matrix of the
system analytically relates the electromagnetic ﬁelds on
either side of an element [12]. Complex structures can be
build up out of simple elements through multiplication of
the respective matrices. Thin nonlinear elements can be
modelled, e.g., as delta-functions [11, 14].

In the PSTD method, the Maxwell equations are dis-
cretized in time and space. The spatial derivatives are

approximated using discrete Fourier transforms and the
temporal derivatives using central diﬀerences. From
this, one derives update equations for the diﬀerent ﬁelds
and by iteration propagates the ﬁelds through time.
The problem of the inherent periodicity of the Fourier
transform can be removed through the use of perfectly-
matched-layer absorbing boundary-conditions [13, 15].
The PSTD method samples all ﬁeld components at the
same location in the unit cell, which is advantageous
when both the electric permittivity and the magnetic per-
meability vary with position [16]. An instantaneous Kerr
nonlinear material is included by directly solving the cu-
bic equation for the intensity [17] at each iteration.

We model the LH material as having Lorentzian fre-
quency dependence in both electric permittivity εr and
magnetic permeability µr,

ponents in the linear regime. (a) Stack of eight periods with
individual layer thickness λ0/3 (solid) [Stack 1 and Stack 3
in Fig. 1(a)] and a stack of four periods with individual layer
thickness λ0/5 (dashed) [Stack 2 in Fig. 1(a)]. (b) Combi-
nation of these stacks when arranged as in Fig. 1(a). The
shading indicates the location of the band gaps for Stack 1
(light grey) and Stack 2 (dark grey) in the limit of an inﬁnite

ωpm = 1.6324 × 1011 s−1, ω1e = ω1m = 2π × 5 × 106 s−1,
and include small losses, γe = 2 × γm = 2π × 6 × 106 s−1.
With these parameters, the refractive index of the LH
material n ≈ −1 at frequency f0 = 15 GHz, and the
material is left-handed for frequencies f < 18.5 GHz and
right-handed for f > 26 GHz. The RH layer is assumed
to be air.

The structure shown in Fig. 1(a) consists of three
stacks with four LH/RH double layers each. The outer
stacks (Stack 1 and Stack 3) have individual layer thick-
nesses of λ0/5, while the central stack (Stack 2) has in-
dividual layer thickness λ0/3; λ0 being the free-space
wavelength of incoming radiation of the frequency f0.
Figure 1(b) shows the same system with a structural de-
fect introduced between Stack 1 and Stack 2. The defect
layer has thickness 2λ0/25.

First, we study the transmission properties of the in-
dividual components of our superlattice in order to an-
alyze the eﬀect of the layer thickness on the positions
of the band gaps and the transmission spectrum. Fig-
ure 2(a) shows the transmission spectrum of a structure
made of the combination of Stack 1 and Stack 3 directly
attached to each other (solid), as well as, the transmis-
sion spectrum of Stack 2 (dashed). The spectra show
several transmission bands and gaps, and we clearly see
a shift of the conventional band gaps due to the scal-
ing of the structure. However, the band gap associated
with vanishing average refractive index hni = 0 (around
f0 = 15 GHz) remains at the same frequency and only
changes its width [10].

The transmission spectrum of the combined structure

and output (dashed) intensity.

of Fig. 1(a) is shown in Fig. 2(b). In the frequency in-
tervals where the central stack is opaque, the structure
has a band gap, while at frequencies where the outer
stacks are opaque but the central stack is transparent the
structure behaves similar to a cavity resonator and shows
the characteristic Fabry-Perot cavity peaks. In this sys-
tem cavity-like behavior occurs in the frequency ranges
of 13.5–14.3 GHz, 16.3–17.5 GHz, and 25.8–29.9 GHz.

To study the nonlinear transmission of our multi-stack
structure, we introduce a defect layer with a linear elec-
tric permittivity εr = 4, see Fig. 1(b). For the TMM
calculations, we place a delta-function Kerr-type non-
linearity at the left interface of the defect layer [14]
εr[1 + δ(x − x0)], x0 = 1.6λ0, while in the PSTD cal-
culations the entire defect layer has a nonlinear electric
permittivity εr(t) = 4+χ(3) |E(t)|2, with the nonlinearity
coeﬃcient χ(3) = +4. We study the diﬀerence in trans-
mission when the light is incident from opposite sides of
the structure. In the linear case, the reciprocity princi-
ple holds as expected and the transmission coeﬃcient is
independent of direction of incidence, while a nonlinear
asymmetric structure can show directional dependence
of the transmission indicating the corresponding diode
action eﬀect [1, 2].

First, we employ the TMM and study the steady-state
results. In this situation it is convenient to ﬁx the trans-
mitted (output) ﬁeld and calculate backwards to ﬁnd the
incident and reﬂected ﬁelds. In Fig. 3 we present a spec-
tral interval including the ﬁrst two peaks (peaks A, B)
above the hni = 0 band gap of Stack 2 for several ﬁxed
transmitted ﬁeld strengths and diﬀerent directions of in-
cidence. The inclusion of the defect shifts all peaks in
Fig. 2(b) to slightly lower frequency in the linear regime.
Due to the nonlinear properties of the defect, the fre-
quencies of the transmission resonances vary with the

local electric ﬁeld intensity which in turn varies with the
output ﬁeld. Since the behavior of peak B is very sim-
ilar for the two directions of incidence, the output ﬁeld
strengths in the ﬁgure are chosen to highlight the behav-
ior of peak A. The frequency shift of peak A occurs at
very diﬀerent output ﬁeld strengths depending on the di-
rection of incidence. As the input ﬁeld is increased, all
the transmission peaks shift to lower frequencies (solid
arrows in Fig. 3). The curves are presented with ﬁxed
output ﬁeld and one notices that all peaks shift to lower
frequencies with increased output ﬁeld (dashed arrows in
Fig. 3), except for peak A in the case of incidence from
the left [Fig. 3(a)], which moves to higher frequencies.
This opposite shift in frequency means that while gener-
ally the output ﬁeld at the transmission peak increases
with increased input ﬁeld, for this peak the output ﬁeld
actually decreases as the input ﬁeld is increased. Re-
ferring to Fig. 2(b) one notices that peak A is located
slightly above a band gap of the central stack (Stack 2).
With increased input intensity the nonlinear defect shifts
the peak to lower frequency such that it moves deeper
into the band gap and becomes increasingly suppressed.
Behavior similar to peak A is also found for the ﬁrst peak
(peak C) above the ﬁrst Bragg band gap of Stack 2 (not
shown).

Next, in Fig. 4, we compare the output intensity as
a function of input intensity for incidence from the two
opposite sides at frequencies with equal relative detuning
from peak A and peak C, calculated using the TMM. We
ﬁnd strong nonreciprocity in all cases. The transmission
in the two directions diﬀers by up to a factor of 6 for
peak A and a factor of 4 for peak C. Peak A also shows
strong bistability for both directions. The switching in-

FIG. 5: PSTD results: Hysteresis curve of the structure for
a Gaussian pulse incident from the left (a) and the right (b).
The incident ﬁeld has carrier frequency fc = 16.19 GHz (peak
A), width parameter 1100/fc, and peak amplitude 0.55. The
arrows indicate the direction of change with time.

tensity threshold for incidence from the left is almost
an order of magnitude lower than for incidence from the
right. With the given detuning from the linear transmis-
sion peak frequency one ﬁnds no bistability for peak C
but with stronger detuning bistability does appear. Such
bistability in an optical diode was previously mentioned
in [2, 18].

Finally, we simulate the transmission using the PSTD
method. This time-domain method inherently includes
the higher harmonics that may occur due to the nonlinear
material. We use a spatial step-size of ∆x = λ0/75 and
a temporal step-size of ∆t = ∆x/(πc). The incident ﬁeld
was chosen as a long Gaussian pulse with peak amplitude
0.55, carrier frequency fc = 16.19 GHz (peak A) and
width parameter 1100/fc, to operate in a regime where
the envelope magnitude varies slowly. Figure 5 shows
the magnitude of the short-time Fourier-transform at the
carrier frequency and at its third harmonic. Again, we
ﬁnd that the transmission strongly diﬀers for incidence
from the two sides. Transmission at fc is initially higher
for incidence from the left but when the incident inten-
sity reaches 0.04 transmission for incidence from the right
becomes greater. On the other hand, the transmission at
3fc is always much greater for the pulse incident from
the left. At 3fc the structure is essentially transparent,
as the LH-material slabs have εr ≈ µr ≈ n ≈ 1 at that
frequency. We ﬁnd bistability for the carrier frequency, as
well as, its third harmonic with incidence from either di-
rection. The threshold switching intensities diﬀer greatly
for the two directions. The switching intensities for the
two frequencies with a particular direction of incidence
are very similar to one another. These results agree well
with the TMM calculation.

In our PSTD simulations we also encountered
modulational-instability-like behavior in this system with

diﬀerent threshold intensities for the onset of this insta-
bility. This eﬀect will be subject to further investigation.
In conclusion, we have studied numerically the linear
and nonlinear transmission of a novel type of multilayer
structures composed of two diﬀerent dielectric materi-
als. We have shown that asymmetric periodic structures

with nonlinear layers can demonstrate highly nonrecip-
rocal transmission which is a major characteristic of an
optical diode. We have analyzed the properties of the
left-handed diode by employing the transfer-matrix ap-
proach and direct pseudospectral time-domain numerical
simulations, and have shown its bistable behavior.

We resort to the concept of turns to provide a geometrical representation of the action of any
lossless multilayer, which can be considered as the analogous in the unit disk to the sliding vectors in
Euclidean geometry. This construction clearly shows the peculiar eﬀects arising in the composition
of multilayers. A simple optical experiment revealing the appearance of the Wigner angle is analyzed
in this framework.

INTRODUCTION

The search for mathematical entities that could de-
scribe physical phenomena has always been a top priority.
For example, the need to describe a direction in space,
combined with the use of geometry to approach physical
problems, brought forth the concept of a vector.

The idea that the complex numbers have a geometrical
interpretation as vectors lying in a plane, led to Hamilton
to introduce quaternions with the aim of being useful for
the analysis of three-dimensional space [1]. The price to
be paid is that the composition of quaternions is not com-
mutative. Soon after that, it became clear that rotations
can be advantageously represented by unit quaternions.
A notion closely related to Hamilton treatment is that
of turns [2]. The turn associated with a rotation of axis
ˆn and angle ϑ is a directed arc of length ϑ/2 on the great
circle orthogonal to ˆn on the unit sphere. By means of
these objects, the composition of rotations is described
through a parallelogramlike law: if these turns are trans-
lated on the great circles, until the head of the arc of
the ﬁrst rotation coincides with the tail of the arc of the
second one, then the turn between the free tail and the
head is associated with the resultant rotation. Hamilton
turns are thus analogous for spherical geometry to the
sliding vectors in Euclidean geometry.

In recent years many concepts of geometrical nature
have been introduced to gain further insights into the
behavior of layered media. The algebraic basis for these
developments is the fact that the transfer matrix associ-
ated with a lossless multilayer is an element of the group
SU(1, 1), which is locally isomorphic to the Lorentz group
SO(2, 1) in (2+1) dimensions. This leads to a natural and
complete identiﬁcation between reﬂection and transmis-
sion coeﬃcients and the parameters of the corresponding
Lorentz transformation [3, 4].

In an appealing paper, Ju´arez and Santander [5] devel-
oped a generalization of Hamilton turns to the Lorentz
group, while Simon, Mukunda, and Sudarshan [6, 7]
worked out an equivalent algebraic approach for SU(1, 1).
The goal of this paper is precisely to show how this for-

malism aﬀords a very intuitive image of multilayer optics.
To this end, in Section 2 we present some details of how
the action of any multilayer can be seen as a geometrical
motion in the unit disk. Every one of these motions can
be decomposed in terms of two reﬂections, which justiﬁes
the idea of turn introduced in Section 3, where their com-
position law is also introduced via a parallelogram law,
in close analogy with what happens for sliding vectors
in Euclidean geometry. The noncommutative character
of this law leads to interesting phenomena, such as the
appearance of extra phases in the composition of multi-
layers, which is examined in Section 4, giving a simple
though nontrivial example that illustrates clearly how
this geometrical scenario works in practice.

II. MULTILAYER ACTION IN THE UNIT DISK

We start by brieﬂy summarizing the essential ingre-
dients of multilayer optics we shall need for our pur-
poses [8]. We deal with a stratiﬁed structure that consists
of a stack of plane-parallel layers sandwiched between two
semi-inﬁnite ambient (a) and substrate (s) media that we
shall assume to be identical, since this is the common ex-
perimental case. Hereafter all the media are supposed to
be lossless, linear, homogeneous, and isotropic.

A monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave falls
from the ambient making an angle θ0 with the normal
to the ﬁrst interface and with an amplitude E(+)
. We
consider as well another plane wave of the same frequency
and polarization, and with amplitude E(−)
, incident from
the substrate at the same angle θ0. The output ﬁelds in
the ambient and the substrate will be denoted E(−)
and
E(+)
, respectively. The ﬁeld amplitudes at each side of
s
the multilayer are related by the linear relation

In Ref. [9] we have proposed viewing the multilayer
action in a relativisticlike framework, giving a formal
equivalence between the ﬁelds in Eq. (2.1) and space-
time coordinates in a (2 + 1)-dimensional space. These
coordinates verify (x0)2
(x2)2 = 1, which de-
ﬁnes a unit two-sheeted hyperboloid characteristic of the
group SO(2, 1). If one uses stereographic projection tak-
ing the south pole as projection center, the upper sheet of
the unit hyperboloid is projected into the unit disk, the
lower sheet into the external region, while the inﬁnity
goes to the boundary of the unit disk.

(x1)2

−

−

The geodesics in the hyperboloid are intersections with
the hyperboloid of planes passing through the origin.
Consequently, hyperbolic lines are obtained from these
by stereographic projection and they correspond to cir-
cle arcs that orthogonally cut the boundary of the unit
disk.

We are often interested in the transformation proper-
ties of ﬁeld quotients rather than the ﬁelds themselves.
Therefore, we introduce the complex ratios

z =

E(−)
E(+) .

(2.4)

The action of the transfer matrix can be seen then as a
mapping from the point zs into the point za, according
to [10]

za = Φ[Mas, zs] =

(2.5)

β∗ + α∗zs
α + βzs

,

which is a bilinear or M¨obius transformation. One can
check that the unit disk, the external region and the unit
circle remain invariant under the multilayer action.

To classify the multilayer action it proves convenient to
work out the ﬁxed points of the mapping; that is, the ﬁeld
conﬁgurations such that za = zs ≡
zf = Φ[Mas, zf ],

zf in Eq. (2.5) [11]:

The transformation of a typical oﬀ axis point zs is also shown.

the Euclidean geometry a rotation is characterized for
having only one invariant point, this multilayer action
can be appropriately called a hyperbolic rotation.

When [Tr(Mas)]2 > 4 the action is hyperbolic and it
has two ﬁxed points, both on the boundary of the unit
disk. The geodesic line joining these two ﬁxed points re-
mains invariant and thus, by analogy with the Euclidean
case, this action will be called a hyperbolic translation.
Finally, when [Tr(Mas)]2 = 4 the multilayer action is
parabolic and it has only one (double) ﬁxed point on the
boundary of the unit disk.

Here we will be concerned only with the case
[Tr(Mas)]2 > 4, since it is known that any element of
SU(1, 1) can be written (in many ways) as the product
of two hyperbolic translations [7]. The axis of the hyper-
bolic translation is the geodesic line joining the two ﬁxed
points. A point on the axis will be translated to another
point, a (hyperbolic) distance [12]

When [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4 the multilayer action is elliptic and
it has only one ﬁxed point inside the unit disk. Since in

In Euclidean geometry, a translation of magnitude ζ
along a line γ can be seen as the product of two reﬂec-
tions in any two straightlines orthogonal to γ, separated
a distance ζ/2. This idea can be translated much in the
same way to the unit disk, once the concepts of line and

distance are understood in the hyperbolic sense. In con-
sequence, any pair of points z1 and z2 on the axis of the
translation γ at a distance ζ/2 can be chosen as intersec-
tions of Γ1 and Γ2 (orthogonal lines to γ) with γ. It is
then natural to associate to the translation an oriented
segment of length ζ/2 on γ, but otherwise free to slide
on γ (see Fig. 1). This is analogous to Hamilton’s turns,
and will be called a hyperbolic turn T

γ,ζ/2.

Note that using this construction, an oﬀ-axis point
such as zs will be mapped by these two reﬂections
(through an intermediate point zint) to another point
za along a curve equidistant to the axis. These other
curves, unlike the axis of translation, are not hyperbolic
lines. The essential point is that once the turn is known,
the transformation of every point in the unit disk is au-
tomatically established.

Alternatively, we can formulate the concept of turn
as follows. Let Mas be a hyperbolic translation with
Tr(Mas) positive (equivalently, Re(α) > 1). Then, Mas
is deﬁnite positive and one can ensure that its square root
exists and reads as

Mas =

This matrix has the same ﬁxed points as Mas, but the
translated distance is just half the induced by Mas; i.e.,

p

ζ(Mas) = 2ζ(

Mas).

(3.2)

This suggests that the matrix √Mas can be appropri-
ately associated to the turn T
γ,ζ/2 that represents the
translation Mas, which we shall symbolically write as

(3.3)

One may be tempted to extend the Euclidean com-
position of concurrent vectors to the problem of hyper-
bolic turns. Indeed, this can be done quite straightfor-
wardly [5]. Let us consider the case of the composition
of two translations M1 and M2 (for simplicity, we shall
henceforth omit the subscript as from the multilayer ma-
trices) of parameters ζ1 and ζ2 along intersecting axes γ1
and γ2, respectively. Take the associated turns T
γ1,ζ1/2
and T
γ2,ζ2/2 and slide them along γ1 and γ2 until they
are “head to tail”. Afterwards, the turn determined by
the free tail and head is the turn associated to the resul-
tant, which is thus a translation of parameter ζ along the
line γ. This construction is shown in Fig. 2, where the
noncommutative character is also evident.

In Euclidean geometry, the resultant of this parallel-
ogram law can be quantitatively determined by a direct
application of the cosine theorem. For any hyperbolic
triangle with sides of lengths ζ1 and ζ2 that make an an-
gle θ, we take the expression from any standard book on
hyperbolic geometry [12]

cosh ζ = cosh ζ1 cosh ζ2 + sinh ζ1 sinh ζ2 cos θ,

future use we quote that the (hyperbolic) area Ω of the

IV. APPLICATION: REVEALING THE
WIGNER ANGLE IN THE UNIT DISK

To show how our formalism can account for the exis-
tence of peculiar eﬀects in the composition of multilayers,
we address here the question of how the Wigner angle
appears in the unit disk and propose a simple optical
experiment to determine this angle.

The Wigner angle emerges in the study of the com-
position of two noncollinear pure boosts in special rel-
ativity: the combination of two such successive boosts
cannot result in a pure boost, but renders an additional
pure rotation, usually known as the Wigner rotation [13]
(sometimes the name of Thomas rotation [14, 15] is also
used). In other words, boosts are not a group.

To ﬁx the physical background, consider three frames
of reference K, K ′ and K ′′. Frames K-K ′ and K ′-K ′′
have parallel respective axes. Frame K ′′ moves with uni-
form velocity v2 with respect to K ′, which in turn moves
with velocity v1 relative to K. The Lorentz transforma-
tion that connects K with K ′′ is given by the product
L1(v1)L2(v2), which can be decomposed as

L1(v1)L2(v2) = L(12)(v)R(Ψ),

(4.1)

where one must be careful in operating just in the same
order as written in Eq. (4.1). In words, this means that
an observer in K sees the axes of K ′′ rotated relative to

the observer’s own axes by a Wigner rotation described
by R(Ψ). The explicit expression for the axis and angle
of this rotation can be found, e.g. in Ref. [13] and will be
worked out below from the perspective of the unit disk.
Consider the equivalent problem for multilayers. First,
SU(1, 1) can be ex-

we observe that any matrix M
pressed in a unique way in the form [16]

∈

M = HU,

(4.2)

where H is positive deﬁnite Hermitian and U is unitary.
One can check by simple inspection that the explicit form
of this (polar) decomposition reads as [17]

(cid:20)

(4.3)

The component H is equivalent to a pure boost, while U
is equivalent to a spatial rotation.

It is clear from Eq. (4.3) that [Tr(H)]2 > 4, so it repre-
sents a hyperbolic translation. Moreover, one can check
that its associated ﬁxed points are diametrically located
on the unit circle and so, the axis of this translation is
precisely the diameter joining them. By writing

R = tanh(ζ/2) exp(iρ),

T = sech(ζ/2) exp(iτ ),

(4.4)
one can easily check that the matrix H in Eq. (4.3) trans-
forms the origin into the complex point R, that is,

Φ[H, 0] = R,

Φ[H−1, R] = 0.

(4.5)

In complete analogy with Eq. (4.1) we compose now
two multilayers represented by Hermitian matrices H1
and H2 (that is, with zero transmission phase lag τ1 =
τ2 = 0) and we get, after simple calculations [18]

mitian matrices H1 and H2. H2 maps zs into the origin, while
H1 maps the origin into za. We show also the associated turns

parallelogram law. The composite multilayer H1H2 trans-
forms the point zs into za. The data of the corresponding

transforming the origin by H1. According to Eq. (4.5),
one has

R2] = 0,

Φ[H1, 0] = R1.

Consider now the (geodesic) triangle deﬁned by the
points zs, O and za in Fig. 3. The general formula (3.5)
gives for this triangle

Ω = Ψ,

(4.9)

which conﬁrms the geometric nature of this Wigner an-
gle, since it can be understood in terms of the area (or
equivalently, the anholonomy) of a closed circuit [19, 20].
According to the ideas developed in Section 3, we can
reduce the multilayers H1 and H2 to the associated turns,
represented by arrows in Fig. 3. The “head to tail”
rule applied to T1 and T2 (for simplicity, we omit in the
subscripts of these turns the corresponding parameters)
and immediately gives the resulting turn T
(12). However,
note that, if we follow the formal prescription shown in
Eq. (3.3) and ascribe T1 7→
√H2, we
conclude that the composition law imposes

√H1 and T2 7→

and the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the corresponding
multilayer. The appearance of an extra unitary matrix in
Eq. (4.6) is the signature of a Wigner rotation in the mul-
tilayer composition and, accordingly, the Wigner angle Ψ
is just twice the phase of the transmission coeﬃcient of
the compound multilayer.

To view this Wigner angle in the unit disk, let zs be
the point in the substrate that is transformed by the

T

(12) 7→

H1H2.

(4.10)

p
All these results are independent on the position of

the turn. In fact, in Fig. 4 we have put the turn T
(12)
in diﬀerent positions along the axis γ. In every position,
we have drawn two radii passing through the head and
the tail of T
(12) and taken on them twice the hyperbolic
distance from the origin. The pairs of points obtained in

5

incidence. Such a simple system could be manufactured
with standard evaporation techniques.

We have performed a computer simulation of the per-
formance of this multilayer H1 using a standard package,
obtaining T1 = 0.9055 and R1 = 0.3736
0.2014i, which
in turn gives τ1 = 0 and ρ1 =

0.4944 rad.

−

Our second multilayer H2 is a symmetric system
formed by two ﬁlms of zinc sulphide and thickness 40 nm
separated by a spacer of air with a phase thickness
3.707 rad. For this subsystem we have T2 = 0.9399 and
R2 = 0.3413i, and therefore τ2 = 0 and ρ2 = π/2 rad.

−

When these two multilayer are put together, the re-
sulting one has a transmission phase lag of τ = 0.1361
rad, which is just half the area of the triangle zsOza, as
predicted by the theory.

In summary, we expect that the geometrical approach
presented here will be a useful tool for representing in a
graphical way the multilayer action. Moreover, the com-
position law of these turns allows for a clear understand-
ing of the nontrivial eﬀects appearing in the composition
of multilayers.

We stress that the beneﬁt of this approach lies not in
any inherent advantage in terms of eﬃciency in solving
problems in layered structures. Rather, we expect that
turns could provide a general and unifying tool to an-
alyze multilayer performance in an elegant and concise
way that, in addition, is closely related to other ﬁelds of
physics.

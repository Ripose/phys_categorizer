We report a rich spectrum of isolated solitons residing inside (embedded into) the continuous radi-
ation spectrum in a simple model of three-wave spatial interaction in a second-harmonic-generating
planar optical waveguide equipped with a quasi-one-dimensional Bragg grating. An inﬁnite sequence
of fundamental embedded solitons are found, which diﬀer by the number of internal oscillations.
Branches of these zero-walkoﬀ spatial solitons give rise, through bifurcations, to several secondary
branches of walking solitons. The structure of the bifurcating branches suggests a multistable con-
ﬁguration of spatial optical solitons, which may ﬁnd straightforward applications for all-optical
switching.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent studies have revealed a novel class of embedded
solitons (ESs) in various nonlinear-wave systems. An ES
is a solitary wave which exists despite having its inter-
nal frequency in resonance with linear (radiation) waves.
ESs may exist as codimension-one solutions, i.e., at dis-
crete values of the frequency, provided that the spectrum
of the corresponding linearized system has (at least) two
branches, one corresponding to exponentially localized
solutions, the other one to delocalized radiation modes.
In such systems, quasilocalized solutions (or “generalized
solitary waves” [1]) in the form of a solitary wave resting
on top of a small-amplitude continuous-wave (cw) back-
ground are generic [2]. However, at some special values of
the internal frequency, the amplitude of the background
may exactly vanish, giving rise to an isolated soliton em-
bedded into the continuous spectrum.

Examples of ESs are available in water-wave mod-
els, taking into account capillarity [3], and in several
nonlinear-optical systems,
including a Bragg grating
incorporating wave-propagation terms [4] and second-
harmonic generation in the presence of the self-defocusing
Kerr nonlinearity [5] (the latter model with competing
nonlinearities was introduced earlier in a diﬀerent con-
text [6]).

It is relevant to stress that ESs, although they are iso-
lated solutions, are not structurally unstable.
Indeed,
a small change of the model’s parameters will slightly
change the location of ES (e.g., its energy and momen-
tum, see below), but will not destroy it, which is clearly
demonstrated by the already published results [3,5]. In
this respect, they may be called generic solutions of codi-
mension one.

ESs are interesting because they naturally appear

when higher-order (singular) perturbations are added
to the system, which may completely change its soli-
ton spectrum. Optical ESs have a potential for applica-
tions, due to the very fact that they are isolated solitons,
rather than occurring in continuous families. The stabil-
ity problem for ESs was solved in a fairly general analyti-
cal form in Ref. [5], which was also veriﬁed by direct sim-
ulations of the model considered. It was demonstrated
that ES is a semi-stable object which is fully stable to
linear approximation, but is subject to a slowly growing
(sub-exponential) one-sided nonlinear instability. Devel-
opment of this weak instability depends on values of the
system’s parameters; in some cases, it is developing so
slowly that ES, to all practical purposes, may be regarded
as a fully stable object [7].

In the previously studied models, only a few branches
of ESs were found, and only after careful numerical
searching, which suggest they may be hard to observe in
a real experiment. The present work aims to investigate
ESs in a recently introduced model of a three-wave inter-
action in a quadratically nonlinear planar waveguide with
a quasi-one-dimensional Bragg grating [8], which can be
quite easily fabricated. It will be found that ESs occur in
abundance in this model, hence it may be much easier to
observe them experimentally. It should also be stressed
that, unlike the previously studied models, in which ESs
appear in relatively exotic conditions, e.g., as a result of
adding singular perturbations [4] or specially combining
diﬀerent nonlinearities [5], the model that will be con-
sidered below and found to give rise to a rich variety of
ESs, is exactly the same which was known to support
vast families of ordinary (non-embedded) gap solitons.
This, in particular, implies that ES can be found in the
corresponding system under the same conditions which
are necessary for the observation of the regular solitons,

1

i.e., the experiment may be quite straightforward. An es-
timate of the relevant physical parameters will be given
at the end of the paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In sec-
tion 2, we recapitulate the model and obtain solutions in
the form of fundamental zero-walkoﬀ ESs, which, physi-
cally, correspond to the case when the Poynting vector of
the carrier waves is aligned with the propagation direc-
tion. The analysis is extended in section 3 to the case of
fundamental walking ESs, for which the Poynting vector
and the propagation distance are disaligned. Concluding
remarks are collected in section 4.

II. THE MODEL AND ZERO-WALKOFF
SOLITONS

The model describes spatial solitons produced by the
second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a planar waveg-
uide, in which two components of the fundamental har-
monic (FH), v1 and v2, are linearly coupled by the Bragg
reﬂection on a grating in the form of a system of scores
parallel to the propagation direction z (for a more de-
tailed description of the model see [8]):

∗
2 = 0,
i(v1)z + i(v1)x + v2 + v3v
∗
1 = 0,
i(v2)z − i(v2)x + v1 + v3v
2i(v3)z − qv3 + D(v3)xx + v1v2 = 0.

(1)
(2)

(3)

Here v3 is the second-harmonic (SH) ﬁeld, x is a normal-
ized transverse coordinate, q is a real phase-mismatch
parameter, and D is an eﬀective diﬀraction coeﬃcient.
The diﬀraction terms in the FH equations (1) and (2)
are neglected as they are much weaker than the artiﬁcial
diﬀraction induced by the Bragg scattering, while the SH
wave, propagating parallel to the grating, undergoes no
reﬂection, hence the diﬀraction term is kept in Eq. (3).
Experimental techniques for generation and observa-
tion of spatial solitons in planar waveguides are now well
elaborated ( [9]), and the waveguide carrying a set of
parallel scores with a spacing commensurate to the light
wavelength (which is necessary to realize the resonant
Bragg scattering) can be easily fabricated. Therefore, the
present system provides a medium in which experimen-
tal observation of ESs is most plausible. As mentioned
above, the observation of ES in this system should be fur-
ther facilitated by the fact that it supports a multitude
of distinct ES states, see below.

Eqs.

FIG. 1.

The (k, q) parameter plane of the three-wave
model (1) – (3). The linear analysis (the results of which
are summarized in the inset boxes) shows that ES with c = 0
may occur only in the region between the solid bold lines. The
bundle of curves emanating from the point (k = 1, q = −4)
are branches of embedded-soliton solutions with c = 0.

Soliton solutions to Eqs. (1)–(3) are sought in the form

v1,2(x, z) = exp(ikz) u1,2(ξ), v3(x, z) = exp(2ikz) u3 ,

where ξ ≡ x − cz, with c being the walkoﬀ (slope) of the
spatial soliton’s axis relative to the light propagation di-
rection z. The substitution of (6) into Eqs. (1)–(3) leads
to an 8th-order system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
(ODEs) for the real and imaginary parts of v1,2,3 (primes
standing for d/dξ):

Before looking for ES solutions to the full nonlinear
equations, it is necessary to investigate the eigenvalues λ
of their linearized version, in order to isolate the region
in which ESs may exist. Substituting u1, u2 ∼ exp(λξ),
and u3 ∼ exp(2λξ) into Eqs.
(6)–(8) and linearizing,
one ﬁnds that the FH and SH equations decouple in the
linearized approximation. The FH equations give rise to
a biquadratic characteristic equation,

and the SH equation produces another four eigenvalues
given by

Dλ2 − (4k + q)

+ 4c2λ2 = 0.

(11)

A necessary condition for the existence of ESs is that
the eigenvalues given by Eq. (10) have non-zero real parts
- this is necessary for the existence of exponentially lo-
calized solutions - while the eigenvalues from Eq. (11)
should be purely imaginary (otherwise, one will have or-
dinary, rather than embedded, solitons). This discrimi-
nation between the two sets of the eigenvalues is due to
the fact that Eqs. (7) and (8) for the FH components
are always linearizable, while the SH equation (9) may
be nonlinearizable, which opens the possibility for the ex-
istence of ESs [5]. As it follows from Eqs. (10) and (11),
these two conditions imply

k2 + c2 < 1; 4k + q < c2/D .

inequalities (12) is displayed in Fig. 1.

solitons with the zero walkoﬀ: (a) the ground-state for k = 0;
(b) the same solution for k = −0.95; (c,d) the ﬁrst and eighth
“excited states” for k = 0.

In Ref. [8], numerous ordinary (gap [10]) soliton solu-
tions to the present model have been found by means of a
numerical shooting method. To construct ES solutions,
we applied the same method to Eqs. (7), (8) and (9),
allowing just one parameter to vary. From each ES so-
lution that was found this way, branches of the solutions
were continued in the parameters k, q and c, by means of
the software package AUTO [11]. Note that the c = 0 so-
lutions admit an invariant reduction u2 = −u∗
1, u3 = u∗
3,
which reduces the system to a 4th-order ODE system,
thus making numerical shooting feasible.

We conﬁne the analysis to fundamental solitons, which
implies that the SH component u3 has a single-humped
shape (a distinctive feature of gap solitons in the same
system is that not only fundamental solitons, but also

certain double-humped two-solitons (bound states of two
fundamental solitons) appear to be stable [8]). Note that
double- and multi-humped ESs must exist too as per a
theorem from Ref. [12], but leaving them aside, we will
still ﬁnd a rich structure of fundamental ESs.

FIG. 3. A diagram of the c = 0 embedded solitons on the
(energy-ﬂux, mismatch) plane. The inset zooms the most in-
teresting part of the diagram.

We begin with a description of the results from the re-
duced case c = 0, when an additional scaling allows us
to set D ≡ 1 without loss of generality. The results are
displayed in Figs. 1 – 3. There is a strong evidence for ex-
istence of an inﬁnite “fan” of fundamental ES branches.
Among them, we deﬁne a ground-state soliton as the one
which has the simplest internal structure (Fig. 2a). The
next “ﬁrst excited state” diﬀers by adding one (spatial)
oscillation to the FH ﬁeld (Fig. 2c). Adding each time
an extra oscillation, we obtain an indeﬁnitely large num-
ber of “excited states” (as an example, see the 8th state
in Fig. 2d). We stress, however, that all the “excited
states” belong to the class of the fundamental solitons,
rather than being bound states thereof.

In Fig. 1, the ﬁrst nine states (branches) are shown in
the (k, q) parametric plane. Note that the whole bundle
of the branches originates from the point (k = 1, q = −4),
which is precisely the intersection of the two lines which
limit the existence region of ES (see Eq. (12) with c = 0).
At this degenerate point, the linearization (see above)
gives four zero eigenvalues. More branches than those
depicted in Fig. 1 have been found, the numerical re-
sults clearly pointing towards the existence of inﬁnitely
many branches, accumulating on the border q + 4k = 0
of the ES-region. In the accumulation process, each u3
component is successively wider, while the u1,2 ones have
more and more internal oscillations.

Since k is an arbitrary propagation constant, from
physical grounds, the results obtained for the c = 0 solu-
tions are better summarized in terms of energy ﬂux E vs.
mismatch q (Fig. 3). Note that all the branches shown in
Fig. 3 really terminate at their edge points, which exactly
correspond to hitting the boundary k = −1, see Fig. 1.

3

It is also noteworthy that all the solutions are exponen-
tially localized, except at the edge point k = −1, where
a straightforward consideration of Eqs. (7)–(9) demon-
strates that, in this case, ES are weakly (algebraically)
localized as |x| → ∞ (cf. Fig 2b):

u1 ≈

−(4k + q)|x|−1, u2 ≈ (1/2)

−(4k + q)|x|−2,

p

u3 ≈ x−2 .

p

Finally, we observe from Figs. 1 and 3 that the ﬁrst
“excited-state” branch has a remarkable property that it
corresponds to a nearly constant value of q. This means
that while, generally, ES are isolated (codimension-one)
solutions for ﬁxed values of the physical parameters, this
branch is nearly generic, existing in a narrow interval of
the q-values between −4.0 and −3.74.

III. WALKING SOLITONS

We now turn to ESs with c 6= 0, i.e., walking ones.
These were sought for systematically by returning to the
full 8th-order-ODE model and allowing the AUTO pack-
age to detect bifurcations (of the pitchfork type), while
moving along branches of the c = 0 solutions. It tran-
spires that all the bifurcating branches have c 6= 0, i.e.,
they are walking ESs. Such solutions are of codimension-
two in the parameter space (i.e., the solutions can be
represented by curves k(q), c(q)), which can be estab-
lished by a simple counting argument after noting that
the 8th-order linear system has two pairs of pure imagi-
nary eigenvalues. Alternatively, the walking ESs can be
represented, in terms of the energy ﬂux and momentum
(see Eqs. (4) and (5)), by curves E(q) and P (q). We
present results only for the walking solutions which bi-
furcate from the ground and ﬁrst excited c = 0 states,
while other walking ESs can also be readily found.

It was found that the ground-state branch has ex-
actly two bifurcation points, giving rise to two distinct
walking-ES solution branches (up to a symmetry). These
new branches are shown, in terms of the most physi-
cally representative c(q) and E(q) dependences, in Fig.
4. Note that they, eventually, coalesce and disappear. As
the inset to Fig. 4b shows, they disappear via a tangent
(fold, or saddle-node) bifurcation.

The ﬁrst excited state has three bifurcation points.
One of them gives rise to a short branch of walking ESs
that terminates, while two others appear to extend to
q = −∞ (their ostensible “merger” in Fig. 5 is an arti-
fact of plotting). It is known that, in the large-mismatch
limit q → −∞, the present three-wave model with the
quadratic nonlinearity goes over into a modiﬁed Thirring
model with cubic nonlinear terms [13]. This suggests that
the latter model may also support ES. However, consid-
eration of this issue is beyond the scope of the present
work.

FIG. 4. Two branches of “walking” (c 6= 0) embedded soli-
tons bifurcating from the ground-state c = 0 branch: (a) the
walkoﬀ c, and (b) the energy ﬂux E vs. the mismatch q. The
horizontal segment in (a) shows the branch of the c = 0 solu-
tions. The inset in (b) shows that the two branches meet and
disappear via a typical tangent bifurcation.

Fig. 4 clearly shows that, in a certain interval of the
mismatch parameter q, the system gives rise to a multi-
stability, i.e., coexistence of diﬀerent types of spatial soli-
tons in the planar optical waveguide (for instance, taking
account of the fact that each c 6= 0 branch has symmetric
parts with the opposite values of c, we conclude that there
are ﬁve coexisting solutions at q taking values between
about −8 and −11). This situation is of obvious interest
for applications, especially in terms of all-optical switch-
ing [9]. Indeed, switching from a state with a larger value
of the energy ﬂux to a neighboring one with a smaller ﬂux
can be easily initiated by a small localized perturbation,
in view of the above-mentioned one-sided semistability
of ES, shown in a general form in [5]. Such a switching
perturbation can be readily made controllable and mov-
able if created by a laser beam launched normally to the
planar waveguide and focused at a necessary spot on its
surface [14]. Switching between the two branches with
c 6= 0 can be quite easy to realized too, due to small
energy-ﬂux and walkoﬀ/momentum diﬀerences between
them, see Fig. 4.

IV. CONCLUSION

To conclude the analysis, it is necessary to estimate the
actual size of the relevant physical parameters. This is,
in fact, quite easy to do, as there is no essential diﬀerence

4

in the estimate from that which was presented in Ref. [8]
for the ordinary solitons in exactly the same model. This
means that a diﬀraction length ∼ 1 cm is expected for
the SH component, and, deﬁnitely, the diﬀraction lengths
for the FH components, which are subject to the strong
Bragg scattering, will be no larger than that. Thus, a
sample with a size of a few cm may be suﬃcient for the
experimental observation of ESs. The sample may be an
ordinary planar quadratically nonlinear waveguide with a
set of parallel scores written on it. The other parameters,
such as the power of the laser beam that generates the
solitons, etc., are expected to be the same as in the usual
experiments with the spatial solitons [9]. As concerns
the weak semi-instability of ESs, it may be of no practi-
cal consequence for the experiment, as it would manifest
itself only in a much larger sample. In this connection, it
may be relevant to mention that, strictly speaking, the
usual spatial solitons observed in numerous experiments
are all unstable (e.g., against transverse perturbations) in
the usual (linear) sense, but the instability has no room
to develop in real experimental samples.

Finally, we see from Figs. 4 and 5 that the maximum
walkoﬀ that ESs can achieve is, in the present notation,
slightly smaller than 1. According to the geometric inter-
pretation of the underlying equations (1) - (3) (see details
in the original work [8]), this implies that the maximum
size of the misalignment angle between the propagation
direction and the axis of the spatial soliton may be nearly
the same as the (small) angle between the Poynting vec-
tors of the two FH waves and that of the SH wave.

To summarize the work, we have found a rich spec-
trum of isolated solitons residing inside the continuous
spectrum in a simple model of the three-wave spatial in-
teraction in a second-harmonic-generating planar optical
waveguide equipped with a quasi-one-dimensional Bragg
grating. An inﬁnite sequence of fundamental embedded
solitons were found. They diﬀer by the number of in-
ternal oscillations. The embedded solitons are localized
exponentially, except for a limiting degenerate case, when
they become algebraically localized. Branches of the
zero-walkoﬀ spatial solitons give rise, through bifurca-
tions, to several branches of walking solitons. The struc-
ture of the bifurcating branches provides for a multistable
conﬁguration of the spatial optical solitons. This may
ﬁnd straightforward applications to all-optical switching.

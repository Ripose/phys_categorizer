We studied the intensity distribution of a Gaussian laser beam when it was focussed by an objective
lens with its numerical-aperture up to 0.95. We found that the resulting full widths at half maximum
(FWHM values) at the focus in the x and z directions were not much diﬀerent from the ultimate
FWHM values when the initial beam waist was equal to the entrance pupil radius of the objective
lens. In addition, the increase in FWHM values were less than 100% even when the initial waist
was further reduced to a half.

INTRODUCTION

The spatial resolution in optical scanning microscopy
is critically dependent on the beam spot size near the fo-
cus of a scanning objective lens. In general, the intensity
distribution near the focus can be calculated by the elec-
tromagnetic diﬀraction theory of Wolf and Richards and
Wolf [1, 2, 3]. This theory is based on the vectorial equiv-
alent of the Kirchhoﬀ-Fresnel integral [4, 5] in the Debye
approximation [4, 5]. In many experiments using an ob-
jective lens we usually assume that the incident beam
is a plane wave apertured by the entrance pupil of the
objective lens. However, the light source in the optical
scanning microscopy is often a Gaussian laser beam, not
an ideal plane wave. One can expand the Gaussian beam
and let the central part of it, simulating a plane wave,
incident on the objective lens. A practical question is
then how large the beam should be expanded with re-
spect to the entrance pupil size of the objective lens in
order to obtain a spatial resolution comparable to that
with the ideal plane wave input. To answer this question,
we need to know the near-focal plane intensity distribu-
tion of a Gaussian laser beam with an initial beam width
w0 when focused by an objective lens with an entrance
pupil diameter D.

The intensity distribution in the region of focus have
been measured in several experiments by using a knife-
edge [6, 7] and a tapered ﬁber [8, 9]. However, a sys-
tematic investigation of the near-focus intensity distri-
bution in the non-paraxial regime as a function of the
input Gaussian beam width w0 has not been performed

input beam width incident on objective lenses with a nu-
merical aperture (NA) of 0.4, 0.75 and 0.95, respectively,
and measured the transverse (xy proﬁle) and longitudinal
(yz proﬁle) intensity distributions of the focused beam by
scanning a pinhole of 0.5µm diameter along or perpen-
dicular to the optic axis of the objective lens. From the
measured distribution we determined the transverse and
longitudinal beam spot sizes associated with the illumi-

nation part of our scanning microscope.

We found that the incident beam waist w0 (half width)
need not be much larger than the entrance pupil radius
R(= D/2) in order to achieve a resolution comparable to
that obtainable with a plane wave input. Particularly,
when w0 = R, both xy and yz beam spot sizes diﬀer by
less than 5% from their ultimate beam spot sizes in our
calculations and by at most 20% even in actual measure-
ments, which are subject to lens aberrations. We also
found that one can allow the initial beam waist to be
as small as R/2 only to increase FWHM values by twice
from the ultimate FWHM values.

II. THEORY

Suppose a Gaussian beam with a waist w0 is incident
on an objective lens with a high NA and an entrance
pupil radius of R. We can think of three diﬀerent regimes,
R. We
namely, (i) w0 ≪

A. Field distribution near the focal region in
general cases

where

We use the vectorial Debye-Wolf diﬀraction integral,
or the electromagnetic diﬀraction theory of Richards and
Wolf [1, 2, 3], for the numerical calculation of the inten-
sity distribution of the focused beam. For the integral,
we choose our Cartesian coordinate system in the follow-
ing way (see Fig. 1). The origin is located at the focus,
z axis coincides with the optic axis of the optical system
under consideration, pointing in the beam propagation
direction and x axis points in the polarization direction
of the incident ﬁeld e0. A time-independent part e(r)
of the analytical solution of the Helmholtz’s equation for
the electric ﬁeld at a point P(r) in the image space of our
optical system is given by [1]

where s = (sx, sy, sz) is a unit vector pointing in the
direction of a ray, Φ(sx, sy) represents aberration in the
optical system, Ω is the solid angle subtended by the
exit pupil of the objective lens from the origin, the focus,
and a, called an electric strength factor, is the electric
ﬁeld incident on the exit pupil after passing through the
lens. Similarly, the magnetic ﬁeld h(r) can be written
in the same way in terms of a diﬀerent strength factor
b(= s
a). Eq.(1) is valid only if kf >> Ω/4, where f

We introduce spherical polar coordinates (f, ϑ, ϕ) for
the point Q on the exit pupil and (r, θ, φ) for the obser-
vation point P in the image space. The Cartesian com-
ponents of the strength vector a can then be written as

non-paraxial cases with α up to the order of unity. The

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 5. A He-Ne
laser (Uniphase, 4mW, 632.8nm) with x-polarization was
ﬁrst incident on a spatial ﬁlter, and then expanded and
collimated to a Gaussian beam with a beam waist w0
and its proﬁle was measured on a CCD. An objective
lens was mounted on a xyz-translation stage with its z
coordinate scanned by a PZT stack so that it could be
coarse-positioned manually and ﬁne-scanned by the PZT
in the z direction. An inﬁnity-corrected microscope ob-
jective lens with NA=0.4, 0.75 (both from NIKON) and
0.95 (from OLYMPUS) were used. A pinhole (National
Aperture, φ = 0.5
0.1µm), which served as an inten-
sity probe, was mounted on a translation stage with PZT
stacks for scanning in the x- and y directions. The thick-

±

ness of the pinhole substrate (stainless steal) was about
10 µm, and thus the opening was in a shape of a cylin-
der. The diameter of the opening was about 1 µm near
the surface of the substrate, but it decreased to 0.5 µm
near the center of the substrate. The light transmitted
through the pinhole was detected by a photomultiplier
tube and the signal was digitized by a data acquisition
board on a computer as a function of x- and y-PZT con-
300
trol voltages. A resulting image amounted to a 400
array.

intensity distribution in the xy focal plane, we deter-
mined the full width at half maxium (FWHM) in the
x direction(∆xFWHM), and similarly from that in the
yz meridonal plane, we measured the FWHM in the z
direction(∆zFWHM). For instance, the intensity proﬁle
created by an objective lens with NA=0.95 for an in-
put beam of w0=5.61mm is shown in Fig. 6. Since the
entrance pupil radius R of the objective lens was 1.71
mm, the incident beam could be considered a plane wave.
The xy proﬁles in Fig. 6 were measured at an interval
of 0.2 µm in the z direction. The direction of beam
propagation was from frame 1 to frame 12 in Fig. 6.

The time-averaged z component of the Poynting vec-
tor in the near focus was calculated from Eq.(11). To
compare experiment with theory, we assumed that the
total amount of light detected by the PMT through the
pinhole was proportional to the convolution of the z com-
ponent of the Poynting vector with the pinhole opening.

where P (x, y) is an aperture function for the pinhole.
This assumption is equivalent to saying that the possi-
ble ﬁeld distortion by the conducting surface of the pin-
hole substrate does not aﬀect the amount of energy ﬂow
through the pinhole much so that we just integrate the
normal component of the unperturbed Poynting vector
calculated for the absence of the pinhole over the aperture
function of the pinhole. The validity of this assumption
is justiﬁed below.

When w0 is equal to the radius of the entrance pupil
R, which was 4.0, 3.0, 1.72 mm for NA=0.4, 0.75, 0.95,
respectively, the resulting theoretical FWHM values dif-
fer by less than 5% from those ultimate FWHM values,
R, as can be seen in Fig. 4
which occur when w0 ≪
whereas the experimental FWHM values diﬀer by at most
20% (see Fig. 7) from the convoluted ultimate FWHM’s.
When w0 is reduced to R/2, the increase in theoretical
FWHM values are much less than twice, being about
20% for NA=0.4 and 0.75 and about 80% for NA=0.95.
The increase in measured FWHM values are more than
in those theoretical ones, being about 100% for all except
for the z-FWHM values for NA=0.4. The smallest mea-
sured x- and z-FWHM values are (0.99 µm, 6.05 µm) for
NA=0.4, (0.59 µm, 1.55 µm) for NA=0.75 and (0.49 µm,
0.9 µm) for NA=0.95. These values were reasonably well
matched with the convoluted FWHM values.

The discrepancies between theory and experiment in-
cluding the large ones for NA=0.4 may come from two
possible causes. One is the ﬁeld distortion caused by the
pinhole itself. This eﬀect should be less serious for large
beam waists than the small beam waists. However, the
discrepancies were mostly observed for large beam waists
as in the case of NA=0.4, and thus the ﬁeld-distortion
does not appear to be the major source of the observed
discrepancies. The more possible source of discrepancy is
the aberration of the microscope objective lens itself. The
fact that the discrepancies were more serious in z-FWHM
values than in x-FWHM values support this reasoning.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We studied the intensity distribution in the region of
focus when a linearly-polarized well collimated Gaussian
beam with a waist of w0 was incident on a high-NA ob-
jective lens with an entrance pupil radius of R. For a
given NA, we varied the initial w0 and measured x- and
z-FWHM values of the intensity distributions which were
obtained by scanning a pinhole of 0.5µm diameter across
the focused beam and by measuring the total transmitted
light through the pinhole. We used the vectorial Deby-
Wolf diﬀraction integral for calculating a time-averaged
Poynting vector in the near focus. The results obtained
by convoluting the Poynting vector with the pinhole were
well matched with the measured intensity distributions.

yz proﬁles were 4.64µm×3.48µm and 4.64µm×3.00µm, respectively.

The smallest measured x- and z-FWHM values were 0.49
µm and 0.9 µm, respectively, for NA=0.95. We found
that when w0 = R both x- and z-FWHM values diﬀer by
less than 5% from their ultimate FWHM values in our

calculations and by at most 20% even in actual measure-
ments. We also found that one can allow the initial beam
waist as small as R/2 only to increase the FWHM values
by twice from the ultimate FWHM values.

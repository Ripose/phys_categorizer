Photon propagation in an adiabatically tapered waveguide may emulate an accelerated motion of
a massive particle which has internal degrees of freedom. We show that the waveguide mode coupling
calculations performed either using classical electrodynamics or via the Unruh eﬀect produce the
same answer in the case of large mode numbers. Thus, mode coupling in a tapered waveguide may
be considered as a manifestation of the Unruh eﬀect.

In 1974 Hawking showed that black holes can evapo-
rate by emission of thermal radiation1. A closely related
eﬀect had been introduced a few years later by Unruh. He
showed that for an accelerating observer vacuum should
look like a bath of thermal radiation with temperature T
deﬁned as

kTUH =

¯ha
2πc

,

(1)

where a is the acceleration of the observer2. The Hawk-
ing temperature may be obtained from this formula by
substitution of the free fall acceleration near the black
hole horizon into eq.(1). While well-established theo-
retically, these eﬀects are believed to be very diﬃcult
to observe in the experiment: an observer accelerating
at a = g = 9.8m/s2 should see vacuum temperature of
only 4 × 10−20K. Over the past years quite a few pro-
posals were introduced on how to emulate and/or ob-
serve the Unruh-Hawking radiation. A recent review
of these proposals, which involve various acoustic, op-
tical, accelerator physics, and solid state physics situa-
tions can be found in3. Very recently it was suggested
that the Hawking radiation may potentially be observed
in optical waveguides4. In another recent proposal it was
suggested that the Unruh-Hawking radiation may have
already been detected in the experiments with surface
plasmon polaritons5 which propagate over curved metal
surfaces6. However, despite large number of diﬀerent pro-
posals, no one has reported yet an undisputed experimen-
tal detection of the Unruh-Hawking eﬀect.

In this paper we consider photon propagation in an adi-
abatically tapered optical waveguide. We show that this
geometry may emulate an accelerated motion of a mas-
sive particle which has internal degrees of freedom. The
waveguide mode coupling calculations in this geometry
may be performed either using classical electrodynamics
or via the Unruh eﬀect. We show that these calculations
produce the same answer in the case of large waveguide
mode numbers. Thus, mode coupling in a tapered waveg-
uide may be considered as a manifestation of the Unruh
eﬀect. This eﬀect is easily detectable in the experiment.
An example of such a mode-coupling experiment in a ta-
pered waveguide is presented.

Let us consider a tapered optical waveguide shown in
Fig.1(a). For the sake of simplicity let us disregard the

polarization degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and, thus, consider the scalar theory. Let us as-
sume that all the walls of the waveguide are made of
an ideal metal. The waveguide is ﬁlled with a dielectric
with refractive index n = 1 (vacuum). The waveguide is
very thin and has a constant width d in the z-direction:
d = const ∼ λ/2, where λ is the wavelength of light
used in the experiment. The dispersion law of photons
propagating inside this waveguide looks like a dispersion
law of a massive quasi-particle with an eﬀective mass
m = π¯h/(cd):

x + k2

y + k2

z = k2

d2 =

Various transverse modes of this waveguide are de-
scribed by the mode number n as ky = nπ/b, where b
is the width of the waveguide in the y-direction, which is
assumed to be large compared to λ. The mode number
n may be considered as an internal degree of freedom of
the quasi-particle. We will assume that the photon is
launched into a state with some particular n = n0 and
the rest of the lateral modes are not excited.

In order to emulate an accelerated motion of this quasi-
particle the width of the waveguide b(x) in the y-direction
may be changed adiabatically as a function of x. Under
such an adiabatic change the photon will most probably
stay in the same lateral mode n = n0, so we can write
for kx an approximate expression

Since d ∼ λ/2, the quasi-particle is non-relativistic and

its acceleration a may be calculated as

where vg = dω/dkx is the group velocity of the quasi-
particle. An observer in the reference frame commov-
ing with the quasi-particle with the same acceleration
a should perceive vacuum as a thermal bath with the
Unruh-Hawking temperature

The internal degrees of freedom of the quasi-particle
are supposed to thermalize at the same temperature
TUH . In the accelerated reference frame, which is com-
moving with the quasi-particle, the energy level splitting
between the internal degrees of freedom is equal to

(see eq.(2)). Thus, there should be a mode coupling

described by the Boltzmanns factor

C∆n ∼ e

kTU H = exp(− 2πωb( ∆n

)

Let us note that the Plancks constant cancelled out
from eq.(7). This indicates that the mode coupling ef-
fect described by eq.(7) does not disappear in the limit
¯h → 0. This feature of the Unruh eﬀect should remain
the same whenever an electromagnetic cavity is used as
a test body to measure the Unruh temperature. It also
means that the eﬀect described by eq.(7) may remain
the same in the classical electrodynamics described by
the Maxwell equations. Let us show that this is indeed
the case when n is large. Note that the fact that fre-
quency of modes with diﬀerent n depends on n in eq.(6)
is the consequence of the transition to the accelerated ref-
erence frame. Since modes with diﬀerent n have slightly
diﬀerent group velocities, they will experience the gravi-
tational blue shift in the accelerated frame. Thus, there
is no contradiction between the frequency shift described
by eq.(6) and the fact that the Maxwell equations are
linear. The mode coupling described by eq.(7) must be
reproduced by proper application of the classical Maxwell
equations.

In the limit of large n (small ∆n/n) the mode coupling

described by eq.(7) may be simpliﬁed as

C∆n ∼ 1 − 2πωb( ∆n
n )
c( db
dx )

= 1 − 2b( ∆n
n )
∆x( db
dx )

,

(8)

where we have introduced ∆x = λ/(2π2). Let us cal-
culate the mode coupling in the classical electrodynamics
using the well-known method of waveguide step discon-
tinuity described for example in ref.7.

We are going to approximate the portion of the adi-
abatically tapered waveguide in Fig.1(a) as a waveguide

step shown in Fig.1(b). The lateral modes in the re-
spective sections of the step waveguide are described by
n = exp(iπny/b0) and φ1
φ0
m = exp(iπmy/b1), respec-
tively. The mode coupling coeﬃcients are obtained as

(9)

Introducing ∆n = (m − n) and ∆b = b1 − b0 =
∆x(db/dx), and assuming the same case of large n (small
∆n/n) we can rewrite eq.(9) as

C∆n =

sin2(πn( ∆b
b ))
π2n2( ∆b

(1 − 2b( ∆n
n )
∆x( db

),

(10)

which in the limit of ∆b/b → 0 converges to the ex-
pression for the mode coupling in eq.(8) obtained via the
Unruh eﬀect. Thus, not surprisingly, the Unruh eﬀect
approach and the classical electrodynamics produce the
same answer for the mode coupling in the limit of large
mode number n. This result may be expected because the
Plancks constant cancelled out from equation (7). Since
the classical limit corresponds to ¯h → 0 and n → ∞ both
approaches are supposed to produce the same result in
this limiting case. We should also mention that the thin
waveguide geometry in Fig.1 emulates theories with a
compactiﬁed extra dimension, such as the Kaluza-Klein
theories (see for example ref.8), in which normal parti-
cles are treated as the modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
guided by a thin extra-dimensional waveguide. Our re-
sult appears to be completely natural and expected if we
accept this analogy.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the mode
coupling in a tapered waveguide may be considered as
a manifestation of the Unruh eﬀect. This eﬀect is eas-
ily detectable in the experiment. An example of such a
mode-coupling experiment in a tapered waveguide is pre-
sented in Fig.2. In this experiment a single mode ﬁber is
adiabatically tapered to sub-micrometer dimensions, so
that the tapered core and cladding of the ﬁber becomes
the core of a multimode optical waveguide. The single op-
tical mode originally coupled to the ﬁber couples to large
number of transverse modes upon propagation through
this multimode waveguide. This is evident from the mul-
tiple rings observed in the mode distribution measured
at the apex of the tapered ﬁber. As a result, this exper-
iment replicates the basic features of the mode coupling
phenomenon discussed above.

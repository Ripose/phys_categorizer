Robustness of One-Dimensional Photonic Bandgaps Under Random Variations of
Geometrical Parameters

The supercell method is used to study the variation of the photonic bandgaps in one-dimensional
photonic crystals under random perturbations to thicknesses of the layers. The results of both plane
wave and analytical band structure and density of states calculations are presented along with the
transmission coeﬃcient as the level of randomness and the supercell size is increased. It is found
that higher bandgaps disappear ﬁrst as the randomness is gradually increased. The lowest bandgap
is found to persist up to a randomness level of 55 percent.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since the pioneering work of E. Yablonovitch [1] and
S. John [2], research on photonic crystals(PCs) has en-
joyed a nearly exponential increase. The manufacture of
PCs at the optical regime has become a reality [3]. Man-
ufacturing brings with it the practical reality of random
errors introduced during the manufacturing process and
it is the eﬀect of these random errors on the desirable fea-
tures of PCs, namely photonic band gaps, that we wish
to address in this paper.

Bandgaps in PCs depend on two crucial properties: an
inﬁnite and perfect translational symmetry. Clearly, in
real life no crystal is inﬁnite in size or perfectly periodic.
When randomness is introduced in the geometry of the
PC, one quantity of interest is the size of the bandgaps
as the level of randomness is increased, and whether the
bandgaps of the bulk perfect PC will survive the random-
ness. Same considerations apply for a ﬁnite PC. In fact,
even for a perfect but ﬁnite PC, one needs to give up
the notion of a bandgap and has to be content with se-
vere depressions in transmittance instead. In this paper,
we will consider both ﬁnite imperfect PCs by examining
the dependence of their transmittance on randomness,
and bulk imperfect PCs by determining their density of
states (DoS) under varying degrees of randomness, using
the supercell method.

Although much has been done [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] regard-
ing imperfect two- and three-dimensional PCs, we feel
that a study of the problem for one-dimensional PCs is
warranted because of the inherent simplicity of the geom-
etry and because a variety of extremely accurate mathe-
matical tools are readily available which allow a detailed
study of the problem without having to compromise ac-
curacy. For instance, because the electric ﬁeld and its
ﬁrst derivative are continuous across the interface, and
because of the low dimensionality of the PC, the conver-
gence problem that plagued band structure calculations
for many 3D PCs [5, 6] is essentially non-existent for 1D
structures. Thus, we were able to use the old trusted
plane wave (PW) method to ﬁnd the band structure and

the DoS for supercell sizes not even imaginable in three-
or even two-dimensional supercell calculations [7, 8]. One
can obtain better than 0.1% convergence with as few as
30 plane waves per unit cell in the supercell. The trans-
∼
mission coeﬃcient, too, can be calculated for nearly arbi-
trary supercell sizes. Finally, one can calculate the band
structure and the imaginary part of the wave vector using
a semi-analytical approach for very large supercells.

The 1D PC is, in many ways, the “inﬁnite square-
well” problem of photonic crystals.
It contains the es-
sential features of its bigger cousins in two and three
dimensions without the mathematical complexities and
the accompanying numerical uncertainties [5, 6] that can
sometimes overshadow the essentials. For example, with
3D face centered cubic structures, it becomes practically
impossible, due to convergence problems, to increase the
supercell size beyond 2
3) con-
×
ventional cubic unit cells which contain only 32 primitive
cells per supercell (or 108), since typically at least
1000
terms per primitive cell are necessary to ensure suﬃcient
convergence for inverse opal structures. It’s not obvious
from the start whether a randomness analysis with such
small supercell sizes would yield results that are physi-
cally meaningful. Artifacts due to the small supercell size
are bound to be inextricably intertwined with the phys-
ically signiﬁcant bulk features of the imperfect PC. It’s
important to realize that, with the supercell method one
still calculates the bands of an inﬁnite perfect PC. The
randomness is only within the supercell, but on a global
scale, it’s still a perfectly periodic structure! In order to
be able to resolve the supercell artifacts from the physical
features brought about by randomness, one needs to en-
sure that the interaction between neighboring supercells,
which, to a good approximation, is proportional to the
surface area of the supercell, be small compared to the
bulk properties of the imperfect PC, which can be taken
to be proportional to the volume of the supercell. Hence,
on purely dimensional grounds, one can argue that the
surface to volume ratio of the supercell 1/L, where L
is the linear size of the supercell, should be small com-
pared to the typical length scale of the problem, namely
the wavelength of the bandgap. We allowed the super-
cell size N to vary from N = 2 to N
9000, and one
can clearly see the supercell artifacts gradually diminish-
ing while the bulk features become more prominent in

≈

the limit as N
. On the other hand, 1D structures
can have features, such as a bandgap for any geometry
and any refractive index contrast, that are certainly not
shared by 2D or 3D PCs.

The precise distribution of randomness in the geome-
try of a PC would surely depend on the details of the
speciﬁc manufacturing process.
In the interest of sim-
plicity, we chose the simplest distribution, the uniform
distribution, in our study. As the unit cell, we chose a
unit “supercell” that consisted of up to
16000 unit
cells. The thicknesses of the layers were perturbed by a
given percent, by adding random numbers chosen from a
uniform distribution. As the unperturbed structure, we
chose the quarter-wave stack that has, for a given dielec-
tric contrast, the largest relative gap between the ﬁrst
and the second bands, as can be seen in Fig. 1. In what
follows, we will consider this structure with a dielectric
contrast of 13 as our perfect PC. For 1D PCs, one fur-

ther has the luxury of calculating the bandgaps using an
analytical method[4]. This approach also permits the cal-
culation of the imaginary part of the wave vector in the
forbidden gap region and allows a reliable assessment of
the accuracy of the plane wave method for the problem
at hand.

We also investigated the transmission coeﬃcient for a
250 unit cell quarter-wave stack structure. The transmis-
sion coeﬃcient was calculated by simply matching the
boundary conditions for the electric and the magnetic
ﬁelds at each interface between the slabs in the multi-
layer structure.

level of accuracy as before, i.e. with N = 1, one would
now need to include N times as many plane waves in
the expansion, which simply increases the computational
burden, both in terms of storage and computing time.
The band structure for N = 1, 2, 3 and 250 are displayed
in Fig 2 for a perfect PC. i The folding of the bands in
the ﬁrst Brilloin zone for each N , makes the appearance
of the bands rather diﬀerent for each case, although the
DoS and the eigenfunctions E would be independent of
the choice of the supercell size. The frequency is plotted
in units of 2π/a for all cases, so the frequency scale is
not aﬀected with the result that the bandgaps are at the
same frequency, as would be expected. To calculate the
DoS, we choose a uniform mesh in k-space to calculate
the bands and then choose a small frequency window,
∆ω, and count the number of modes whose frequencies
fall within that window.

We add random perturbations to the thicknesses of the

layers in the supercell such that

where d0
1,2 are the unperturbed values of the thicknesses
of the layers, i.e.
the quarter-wave stack values, u is
a uniformly distributed random number in the interval
(0, 1). We control the amount of disorder by varying the
percent randomness parameter p between 0 and 1. p = 0
corresponds to perfectly periodic structures, and p = 1
corresponds to 100% ﬂuctuation where d1, d2 can range
between 0 and twice their unperturbed values. When
disorder is introduced, gaps appear between every fold
for N > 1. In Fig. 3 we plot the upper and lower limits
for the lowest three bandgaps as a function of p, the
percent randomness with a supercell size of N = 1024.
Note that since for quarter-wave stack structures the even
numbered gaps are closed, the bandgaps in this ﬁgure are
in fact the ﬁrst, third and the ﬁfth bandgaps of a 1D PC
with arbitrary values for the layer thicknesses. The third
gap centered at ωa/2πc = 1.59 closes around p3 = 0.1,
the second gap centered at ωa/2πc = 0.96 closes around

p2 = 0.18, and the lowest gap centered at ωa/2πc = 0.32
closes around p1 = 0.55. The ratios of the critical values
of randomness p1 : p2 : p3 agree well with the ratios
of the corresponding center gap frequencies, ω3 : ω2 :
ω1. This can be understood using the simple argument
that when the random ﬂuctuations in the thicknesses of
the layers become comparable to the wavelength of the
gap center, the bandgap disappears since the destructive
interference responsible for the existence of the forbidden
band depends on the long range periodicity at that scale.

As discussed in detail in Ref[4], for n dielectric lay-
ers with thicknesses d1, . . . , dn, with dieletric constants
ǫ1, . . . , ǫn, for a given ω, one can obtain the transfer ma-

method. Note the slight shift of the bands due to PW convergence. As N grows, the second bandgap that lies between
0.83 < ωa/2πc < 1.07 in the perfect PC is more and more populated with transmission resonances, thereby narrowing the gap.
For very large values of N , the bandgap appears to settle down to 0.89 . ωa/2πc . 1.01. For N = 4096, only Ki is shown, as
the PW method isn’t practicali for such a large supercell. The cusps in the Ki graph, which correspond to nearly ﬂat bands,

to have a signiﬁcant drop in transmittance. The advan-
tage of the exact method is that the supercell size N can
be increased to values that are practically impossible us-
ing the PW method. While with the PW method, using
30 plane waves per unit cell of the supercell, the memory
(30N )2, and the time require-
requirements scale as

ments scale as
very small amount of memory. The only disadvantage of
the analytical method over the PW method is that, while
in the PW method one chooses a real K and calculates
the frequencies corresponding to that value of K, in the
analytical method, one chooses the frequency ω and cal-
culates the real and imaginary parts of K, Kr and Ki,
corresponding to that value of ω. If the bands are nearly
ﬂat, as is the case for very large supercell sizes, then

one needs to sample the frequency interval of interest in
very tiny increments in ω in order to “catch” a propa-
gating mode. Thus the computation time can become
very large. Also for large values of N , the transfer ma-
trix M can have very large elements so one requires very
high precision in order to calculate the transmission reso-
nance frequencies. We used quadruple precision (128-bit)
ﬂoating point variables and functions in the Intel Fortran
compiler in order to be able to resolve the transmission
resonances for supercell sizes up to N = 8192. For large
values of N , even 128-bit precision is not suﬃcient, with
the result that Ki cannot be made to completely vanish
due to insuﬃcient precision. Nevertheless, the propagat-
ing modes appear as sharp cusps in the Ki vs ω graph
which can easily be identiﬁed (Fig. 4). For N & 8000,
one needs more than 128-bit precision to even see the
cusps in (Fig. 4). For larger values of N , we used Math-
ematica for its arbitrary precision capabilities. However,
compared to compiled code, Mathematica is slower by
several orders of magnitude, so we had to stop at around
N = 32000. To understand the bulk features of imperfect
PCs using the supercell method, one would need a large
supercell, in fact the larger the better. As the supercell

size is increased, small bandgaps begin to appear over re-
gions that used to have propagating modes. One would
normally expect the gaps of the perfect crystal to grad-
ually shrink in size, rather than have more gaps, so this
result seems somewhat puzzling at ﬁrst sight. However,
as the supercell size is increased, the statistical ﬂuctua-
tions decrease, and the pass bands become increasingly
more densely populated. In Fig 4 we display the behavior
of Ki as N is increased. As N becomes larger what used
to be a photonic bandgap becomes more and more pop-
ulated with transmission resonances, and the forbidden
gap edges gradually approach each other, narrowing the
gap. It’s possible that as N
, the whole bandgap
region will be populated, albeit extremely sparsely, and
instead of the bandgap, we will have a region where the
DoS is extremely small—but non-zero nevertheless. We
were able to increase up to N = 32768 and the bandgap
was reduced as N became larger, although the decrease
for very large N values was very small. To actually see
the gap narrow even more would require an impractically
large N .

→ ∞

The number of transmission resonances in any ﬁxed
frequency interval ∆ω is proportional to N , so in the bulk
, any wave packet with a small, but
limit with N
nonzero frequency spread ∆ω would contain many trans-
mission resonances and thus would be partly transmitted
and partly reﬂected. Clearly in the bandgap regions of
the perfect PC, the density of these transmission reso-
nances is extremely small, and these regions still appear
to be bandgaps with a large, but still ﬁnite, supercell.
Hence, it seems plausible to conclude that one cannot
speak of a “true bandgap” for imperfect PCs, but only
of large depressions in the DoS, which, in practice, would
serve the same purpose as bona ﬁde bandgaps. For in-
stance, for a cavity made of an “impurity” embedded in
a PC, localized cavity modes would eventually leak out
through the PC “walls” of ﬁnite thickness, regardless of
how perfect the PC walls are, bacause of the ﬁnite thick-
ness of the walls. For such an application, what is im-
portant is that the lifetime of the cavity mode be much

larger than the relevant time scale. Since the lifetime of
the cavity mode is a function of the transmittance, for
a given value of transmittance, one would simply need
to use thicker walls as the random perturbations are in-
creased.

B. Transmittance

Practical applications must necessarily use ﬁnite sized
PCs, and for such structures, a quantity of more relevance
is the transmittance. We calculate the transmittance by
considering a PC of N unit cells, and each layer is per-
turbed as described earlier. The transmission coeﬃcient
is calculated by imposing the boundary conditions for E
D, B, and H at each layer boundary (Figure 5). This
yields a set of 2n + 2 linear equations for the unknowns
E1, . . . , E2n+2. Setting the incident ﬁeld E0 = 1, and
assuming vacuum dielectric values for the incident and
transmitted ﬁelds, ǫ0 = ǫn+1 = 1, one obtains, R = E2
1
and T = E2
2n+2 for the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃ-
cients, respectively. Alternatively, one could also obtain
R and T from the transfer matrix as detailed in Ref. [4]
but with our approach, we can also obtain the Ei within
each layer. For a given frequency in the gap region, the
dependence of ln T on the number of layers N is approxi-

p, as is the case [4] for the perfectly periodic ﬁnite crystal
(Fig. 6). However, depending on the level of randomness
ln T can change by many orders of magnitude. In prac-
tice, this would mean that in order to obtain a given
value of transmittance using an imperfect PC, one would
now have to use a thicker PC.

Although there is a strong relationship between the
transmittance of a ﬁnite imperfect PC, and the modes of
the superlattice formed by choosing the same exact ﬁnite
PC as the unit supercell, this relationship is not perfect in
the sense that the existence of a propagating mode does
not necessarily imply a large value for T . Conversely,
the existence of a bandgap does not necessarily imply a
low value for the transmittance T . A close examination
of the ln T and Ki vs ω plots in Fig 7 will reveal that,
on a large scale, the transmission has a dip where Ki is
large, and when Ki is small the transmittance is nearly
unity. However, a closer look at a ﬁner scale in Fig. 7,
one sees that ln T can still be not as large as what one
might expect from Ki.

Looking at the plots of ln T vs Ki Fig. 7, one could ar-
gue that Ki sets an upper limit for ln T . This upper limit
seems to be a linearly decreasing function of Ki. That
the actual value of ln T can ﬂuctuate below a particular
value for a given Ki can be understood if one consid-
ers the coupling of the incident plane wave to the modes
inside the PC. If, owing to the randomness, the propagat-
ing mode happens to have a small amplitude near xn+1,

it will not be transmitted eﬀectively. Similar coupling
problems were reported by Robertson et al [12] for 2D
PCs.

III. CONCLUSION

We studied the behavior of the photonic band gap and
the transmittance for an imperfect PC using the super-
cell method combined with both the plane wave method
and the analytical method. We also studied the trans-
mittance for an imperfect ﬁnite 1D photonic crystal and
have shown that the results we obtain in all cases are
consistent. The bandgaps of the perfect PC are replaced
by a DoS that is extremely small to be detected even with
extremely large supercells that consist of over 32000 unit
cells. The higher frequency bandgaps disappear ﬁrst with
the lowest gap closing at around a randomness level of
55%.

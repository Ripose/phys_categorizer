Abstract

The dispersive properties of non-degenerate optical parametric ampliﬁcation in quasi-phase-

matched (QPM) nonlinear quadratic crystals with an arbitrary grating proﬁle are theoretically

investigated in the no-pump-depletion limit. The spectral group delay curve of the ampliﬁer is

shown to be univocally determined by its spectral power gain curve through a Hilbert transform.

Such a constraint has important implications on the propagation of spectrally-narrow optical pulses

through the ampliﬁer. In particular, it is shown that anomalous transit times, corresponding to

superluminal or even negative group velocities, are possible near local minima of the spectral gain

curve. A possible experimental observation of such eﬀects using a QPM Lithium-Niobate crystal

is suggested.

INTRODUCTION

The theoretical and experimental study of second-order nonlinear processes has received

in the past years a renewed interest after the introduction of the quasi-phase-matching

(QPM) technique [1, 2], which has lead to a major advance in applications such as frequency

conversion, parametric oscillation and ampliﬁcation, nonlinear optical frequency mixing and

pulse shaping (see, for instance, [3, 4, 5] and references therein). The QPM technique uses

a periodic modulation of the nonlinear χ(2) coeﬃcient (QPM grating) to compensate for

refractive-index dispersion, permitting phase matching operation at any wavelength at room

temperature, which would not be possible with birefringent phase matching. In addition,

QPM enables the use of materials with strong nonlinearities which are not phase matchable

by angle or temperature tuning, with a polarization state of interacting ﬁelds corresponding

to the largest diagonal element of the χ(2) tensor. Though the physics of the QPM technique

is known since a long time [1], only with the recent technological advances in the electric-

ﬁeld poling of ferroelectric materials, such as LiNbO3, LiTaO3 and KTP, the experimental

potentialities of QPM-based devices have become practicable and have reached nowadays a

satisfactory degree of maturity [5]. The possibility of engineering a QPM grating by breaking

its periodicity introduces additional degrees of freedom for light control which open the way

for a novel class of devices [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In particular, pulse compression

and shaping by second harmonic generation (SHG) or by diﬀerence frequency generation

(DFG) have been proposed and demonstrated using nonuniform QPM gratings [6, 7, 9, 12,

13].

In such cases, it was shown that in the low-conversion regime the spectral transfer

function governing the frequency conversion process is related to the longitudinal QPM

grating proﬁle by a simple Fourier transform (for a detailed analysis and for a discussion of

the distinctive aspects of SHG and DFG cases, see [12, 13]). The use of a QPM nonlinear

crystal for parametric ampliﬁcation of a signal ﬁeld at frequency ω1 by a strong pump ﬁeld at

frequency ω3 has been demonstrated as well, both in waveguide and bulk geometries [16, 17],

with the achievements of gains as large as 40 dB using nanosecond pump pulses [17]. As

compared to most common parametric ampliﬁers based on birefringent phase matching, the

use of a QPM-based parametric ampliﬁer may oﬀer the possibility of molding the spectral

gain response of the ampliﬁer by a suitable design of the QPM grating (see, e.g., [15]).

Though the process of parametric ampliﬁcation is accompanied by the generation of the

2

idler ﬁeld at frequency ω2 = ω3 −
studied in literature [13, 14], the simple Fourier analysis developed for DFG [13], which

ω1 and is thus equivalent to the DFG scheme recently

neglects ampliﬁcation of the signal ﬁeld, is inadequate to study the parametric ampliﬁcation

process in QPM gratings, and a more complex analysis is needed, based e.g. on matrix

transfer techniques [15]. A general theoretical analysis of the properties of a QPM parametric

ampliﬁer, and especially of the interplay between its gain and dispersive properties, has not

been pursued yet. Such a problem is closely related to the ”inverse problem” of QPM grating

synthesis, i.e. of the determination of a QPM grating proﬁle that realizes a desired spectral

gain response of the ampliﬁer.

In this paper we provide a general analysis of the process of parametric ampliﬁcation in

an aperiodic QPM nonlinear crystal. We will show in a very general way that the spectral

power gain curve of the ampliﬁer univocally determines its dispersive properties, whereas the

QPM grating proﬁle that realizes such a spectral gain curve is not uniquely determined. The

interplay between the spectral power gain and dispersive curves of the ampliﬁer may lead

to abnormal dispersive properties of the ampliﬁer, such as the occurrence of superluminal

or even negative group velocities similar to those observed in atomic ampliﬁers with a gain

doublet [18, 19, 20]. The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec.II the basic equations

describing parametric pulse ampliﬁcation in a QPM nonlinear crystal are reviewed. In the

undepleted pump approximation, general properties of spectral gain and dispersion curves

are derived in Sec.III, and the inverse problem of QPM synthesis is addressed. Section

IV deals with the propagation of spectrally narrow pulses and analyzes the occurrence of

anomalous regions corresponding to superluminal or even negative group velocities. Finally,

in Sec.V the main conclusions are outlined.

PARAMETRIC AMPLIFICATION IN QPM QUADRATIC MEDIA: BASIC

The starting point of the analysis is provided by the propagation scalar wave equation

ampliﬁcation or DFG, we assume that

(z, t) is described by the superposition of three

wavetrains with carrier frequencies ω1, ω2 and ω3 = ω1 + ω2, corresponding to the signal,

idler and pump waves, respectively. We thus set

the entrance plane z = 0, whereas the idler wave is generated by parametric interaction in

the nonlinear medium and appears at the output plane z = L (see Fig.1). Substitution of

the power series on the right hand side in Eq.(5) may be truncated at some order. At leading

order in the expansion one retrieves the wavenumber at the carrier frequency ω0, the second

one determines the group-velocity vg = 1/(∂k/∂ω) of the wavetrain, whereas higher order

terms account for group velocity dispersion. If in Eqs.(3) the nonlinear terms are assumed

to be weak and we truncate expansion (5) keeping the ﬁrst term only, one sees that at

varying along the z axis (see, for instance, [12]). We assume that the nominal QPM period

dispersive and absorptive properties of the medium, may be expanded in power series [see

Eq.(5)], and the number of terms that need to be kept depends on the the spectral exten-

sion of the wavetrains. In the following, we will consider spectral regions of transparency

for the medium, so that we will neglect the imaginary part of the dispersion relation k(ω).

SPECTRAL GAIN CURVE AND GROUP DELAY ANALYSIS

In this section we provide a general analytical framework to determine the complex spec-

tral gain curve of a QPM parametric ampliﬁer in the limit of undepleted pump and derive

a general relation among dispersive and gain properties of the ampliﬁer. We assume that

6

the ampliﬁer is pumped by a continuous-wave (CW) or quasi CW strong pump wave at

frequency ω3, and a weak signal ﬁeld at carrier frequency ω1, described by the envelope

A1(0, t) =

∞
−∞

˜f (Ω) exp(

−

iΩt), is incident upon the nonlinear crystal at the plane z = 0.

In the limit of no pump depletion, which is valid for a low or moderate pump conversion,

R

we may disregard Eq.(8c) and assume in Eqs.(8a) and (8b) a constant value of A3, given by
A3 = [2I3/(ǫ0c0n3)]1/2, where I3 is the intensity of the incident CW pump and n3 = n(ω3).

In this case, Eqs.(8a) and (8b) become linear equations, and the signal ﬁeld envelope A1(L, t)

at the exit of the medium can be written using standard Fourier analysis in the form:

A1(L, t) =

where ˜f (Ω) is the Fourier transform of the incident signal wavetrain and g(Ω) is the spectral

gain curve of the ampliﬁer. In order to determine the spectral gain curve g(Ω), let us search

for a solution of Eqs.(8a) and (8b) in the form:

[23] and grating analysis [24, 25, 26, 27], the QPM grating proﬁle def f (z) playing the role

(17)

where the dependence of

M11 on Ω is through the function δ = δ(Ω) [see Eq.(15)]. The
(δ) for a generic scattering potential q(z), i.e. QPM grating proﬁle

def f (z), can be done numerically by a standard cascading technique in which the grating is

decomposed as the cascade of successive uniform sections and

is derived as the product

M

of the elementary matrices of each uniform grating section (see, for instance, [26]). The

application of the cascading technique for the study of DFG and parametric ampliﬁcation in

certain nonuniform QPM gratings has been recently addressed in [14, 15]. The determination

easy: ﬁrst, one has to compute the matrix element

of the spectral gain curve of a QPM parametric ampliﬁer for a given QPM proﬁle is thus
M11 associated with the scattering
problem [Eqs.(14)] by, e.g., the transfer matrix technique, for diﬀerent values of frequency

Ω; the complex spectral gain curve is then retrieved by Eq.(17) with the use of Eq.(13).

Here we are mainly concerned on investigating the interplay between amplitude and phase

relationship of the complex spectral gain curve, which can be derived in a very general way

using the results of the inverse scattering theory. To this aim, it is worth observing that, from

inverse scattering theory, the scattering coeﬃcient a(δ)

1/a(δ) belongs to the class of causal and minimal phase shift functions (see, for instance,

[29]). This means that the knowledge of the modulus of a(δ) univocally determines its phase.

In fact, since the function F (δ) = (∂a/∂δ)/a = ∂(lna)/∂δ is analytic in the lower part of

the complex δ plane and goes to zero for δ

, the real and imaginary parts of F (δ) can

After setting a(δ) =

i.e. the group delay τg. The constraint imposed by Eq.(24) has important impacts on the

response of the ampliﬁer, reducing the ﬂexibility in designing a given spectral gain curve as

compared to the related DFG problem [13]. For instance, the possibility of ”squaring” the

spectral power gain curve of the ampliﬁer comes at the price of an increased phase distortion

[30]. Such limitations come out just because the spectral gain curve satisﬁes the minimum-

phase condition, which is not the case of the DFG transfer function [28]. Another interesting

consequence of Eq.(24) is the existence of spectral regions where the group delay becomes

superluminal or even negative, which will be studied in detail in the next section. Here we

end our general analysis by brieﬂy addressing the issue of the synthesis of the spectral gain

curve g(Ω) of a QPM ampliﬁer (the so-called ”inverse problem”), that is the determination

of the QPM proﬁle def f (z) that realizes a target spectral response g(Ω). Such a problem has

been extensively studied on several occasions in the context of optical ﬁlters and gratings

theory (see, for instance, [31] and references therein), and therefore it will be brieﬂy quoted

potential q(z) is uniquely determined from the knowledge of r(δ) =

satisfy minimal requirements of causality, and that numerical techniques for determination

of q(z) from the knowledge of r(δ) are well developed [31, 32]. Let us now assign a target

power spectral gain curve G(Ω), and ask if there is a QPM grating proﬁle def f (z) that

realizes such a gain response. First of all, G(Ω) should satisfy minimal conditions: G(Ω)

phase at the signal wavelength. For a physically realizable power spectral gain curve G(Ω),

there is not, hence, a unique QPM proﬁle that realizes such a gain response, the diﬀerent

QPM proﬁles corresponding to diﬀerent spectral phase response of the generated idler wave.

The non-uniqueness of the inverse problem is analogous to that encountered, e.g., in the

design of ﬁber Bragg gratings for use in transmission [33, 34].

IV. ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION OF SPECTRALLY NARROW OPTICAL

PULSES: SUPERLUMINAL AND NEGATIVE TRANSIT TIMES

A physically important consequence of the dispersive properties of a QPM parametric

ampliﬁer, stated by Eq.(24), is the existence of abnormal group delays, that is the existence

of spectral regions where a spectrally-narrow signal pulse can travel through the ampliﬁer

with a superluminal (τg < L/c0) or even negative (τg < 0) transit time [35]. Let us consider

the propagation of a spectrally-narrow signal pulse through the QPM ampliﬁer. We assume
that the spectrum ˜f(Ω) of the incident pulse is centered at a frequency Ω0, so that we can

write A1(0, t) = exp(

iΩ0t)h0(t) and A1(L, t) = exp(

iΩ0t)hL(t) at the input and output

−

−

planes of the ampliﬁer. If we now assume that the spectral extent of the envelope h0(t) is

narrow enough such that the gain curve g(Ω) of the ampliﬁer varies slowly over the pulse

bandwidth, an asymptotic expansion for hL(t) may be obtained, as detailed in Appendix B.

At leading order one obtains:

hL(t)

g0h0(t

∆τ )

≃

−

where g0 = g(Ω0) is the gain of the ampliﬁer at the pulse central frequency Ω0 and ∆τ is

the complex group delay time, which is given by (see Appendix B):

∂Ω !Ω0

Notice that, since the group delay ∆τ is in general complex-valued, even at leading order

in the expansion [see Eq.(B7) in Appendix B] the ampliﬁer produces a pulse distortion [36].

However, if Ω0 is a stationary point of the spectral gain curve, than the complex group

delay ∆τ becomes real-valued and equal to the usual group delay τg = ∂φg/∂Ω.

In this

case, at leading order the ampliﬁer is distortionless and the pulse transit time is related to

the spectral gain curve G(Ω) by means of the Hilbert transform given in Eq.(24). Let us

now suppose that vg1 > vg2 and that Ω0 is a maximum of the spectral power gain curve;

then for Ω
Ω0, the contribution to the integral on the right hand side in Eq.(24) near the
singularity Ω′ = Ω is negative, and the integral is thus expected to be negative. This implies

≃

that τg > L/vg1, i.e. the eﬀective group velocity of the pulse is lower than vg1. Conversely,

(25)

(26)

11

if Ω0 is a minimum of the spectral power gain curve, the integral in Eq.(23) is expected to

be positive, and the transit time τg lower than L/vg1. This means that superluminal or even

negative transit times may be expected whenever the pulse spectrum is centered around a

minimum of the spectral gain curve [37]. The existence of anomalous transit times for a

pulse tuned midway two ampliﬁcation peaks is indeed a rather general result, and previous

demonstrations of negative transit times have been reported for optical pulses as well as for

electronic signals using a gain-doublet ampliﬁer [18, 19, 20, 38].

To get a quantitative analysis of such eﬀects, let us refer to a periodically-poled Lithium

Niobate (PPLN) crystal pumped at the wavelength λ3 = 532 nm with a signal ﬁeld at

λ1 = 1.55 µm. The idler wave corresponds to the wavelength λ2 = 810 nm; we further
assume extraordinary wave propagation, so that d = d33 ≃
dependent dispersion relation k = k(ω) = n(ω)ω/c0 for extraordinary waves in Lithium
Niobate is determined using Sellmeir equations from Ref.[39]. At 25◦C, one can estimate
vg1 ≃
accessible with current poling technology. The main task in the design of the QPM grating

0.44220c0, and a ﬁrst-order QPM period Λ = 7.39 µm, which is

27 pm/V. The temperature-

0.4815c0, vg2 ≃

is to realize a gain curve G(Ω) with a local minimum, e.g. at Ω0 = 0. There are several

possibilities to achieve a spectral dip in the gain curve of a QPM ampliﬁer, such as the

inclusion of a defect in an otherwise periodic QPM grating or the cascading of two periodic

QPM gratings. We consider here the latter case, however a similar analysis could be done

for the former conﬁguration. The QPM grating, shown in Fig.2, consists of a sequence

of two +/- square-wave uniform gratings, each of length a and period Λ = 2π/∆k (ﬁrst-

order QPM), separated by a distance l. For such a structure one can easily calculate def f ,

and hence q(z), obtaining q(z) = q0 for 0 < z < a, q(z) = 0 for a < z < a + l, and
(2/π)d33[8π2I3/(ǫ0c0n1n2n3λ1λ2)]1/2 and
q(z) = q0 exp(iΦ) for a + l < z < 2a + l, where q0 ≡
Φ is a phase shift that depends on the relative phases of the two square waves in the two

grating sections. For instance, the reversal of sign of def f , corresponding to Φ = π, occurs if

the two square waveforms in the two grating sections are shifted each other by half a period

[see Fig.2(b)]. Notice that, in the limiting case l

0, the structure reduces to a periodic

→

QPM grating of length 2a with a defect at the center of the structure. In order to calculate

the spectral gain curve g(Ω) of the ampliﬁer, we need to evaluate the matrix element

M11
according to Eq.(17). The transfer matrix of the structure shown in Fig.2 can be readily

calculated as the product of the three transfer matrices corresponding to the propagation

in the ﬁrst uniform grating section, the middle grating-free section, and the second uniform

grating section in the reverse order, i.e.:

where β = β(Ω) and δ = δ(Ω) are given, in the general case, by Eqs.(13) and (15). Around

the resonance Ω = 0, the approximate equations (22) may be used, which require the

knowledge of the group velocities for signal and idler ﬁelds solely. A typical behavior of

power spectral gain G(Ω) and corresponding group delay τg(Ω) for a few diﬀerent values of

Φ are shown in Figs.3,4 and 5. The parameter values of the QPM grating structure are a = 3

mm and l = 2 mm. Notice that, in correspondence of local minima in the power spectral

gain curve, the group delay curve shows local minima, corresponding to superluminal and

even negative group delays (see, for instance, Fig.3). An inspection of Eq.(28) reveals that,

for Φ = π, the curve G(Ω) =

For Φ

= π, the curves G(Ω) and τg(Ω) may become strongly asymmetric (as in Fig.4),

the minimum in the gain curve is shifted away from Ω = 0 or multiple local minima may

occurs; however the general rule of faster than vg1 group velocity near local minima of the

power spectral gain curve holds. Figure 6 shows the behavior of the group delay at Ω = 0,

for the case of perfect phase reversal of the two grating sections (i.e., for Φ = π), versus

intensity of the pump wave. The ﬁgure clearly indicates the possibility of controlling the

transit time of a spectrally-narrow signal pulse by the pump intensity. Notice that the group

13

delay becomes superluminal, i.e. smaller than L/c0, at I3 ≃
I3 ≃
oﬀ-resonance power gain peak as large as 40 dB [see Fig.3(a)]. However, since the pulse

135 MW/cm2. To reach the latter regime, the pump intensity corresponds to an

105 MW/cm2 and negative at

spectrum is centered at Ω = 0 where G(Ω)

1, the main eﬀect of the ampliﬁer on pulse

≃
propagation near the gain dip is to advance the pulse in time, not to amplify it. A similar

eﬀect was predicted and observed for pulse propagation in an atomic gain-doublet ampliﬁer

[19, 20]. What physically happens is that in the ﬁst section of the QPM grating the signal
pulse is ampliﬁed, with the generation of the idler wave (ω3 →
the phase reversal in the second QPM grating, a back conversion process (ω1 + ω2 →
occurs in the second grating section. The result of such a cascading process is that the

ω1 + ω2); however owing to

ω3)

signal pulse is basically not ampliﬁed at the output of the crystal, however the phase delays

suﬀered by its spectral components, as ruled by the causality condition [Eq.(24)], produce a

temporal advancement with no appreciable pulse distortion. We have checked the prediction

of pulse propagation based on the group delay analysis by direct numerical simulation of

pulse propagation in a two-section QPM PPLN crystal with perfect phase reversal (Φ = π)

starting from Eqs.(8) in the limit of an undepleted pump. As a probing pulse, we assumed a

transform-limited Gaussian pulse, tuned at Ω = 0, with a pulse duration (FWHM) of 250 ps

to ensure the spectrally-narrow pulse limit. Figure 7 shows the traces of the incident signal

pulse at the entrance plane of the crystal z = 0 (dotted line) and of transmitted pulses at

the exit plane z = L (solid lines) for increasing values of the pump intensity I3; the pulse

intensity of the output waveforms are normalized to the peak intensity of incident pulse. It

is remarkable that, at pump intensities corresponding to, e.g., curve 4, the transmitted pulse

leaves the ampliﬁer before the peak of Gaussian incident pulse has entered into the crystal.

To make a quantitative estimate of pump power levels required to observe such eﬀects, let us

assume a Gaussian pump with a beam waist of

200 µm; then curve 3 of Fig.7 corresponds

to a pump peak power of

170 kW. Using a pulsed pump of duration (FWHM) of

ns, i.e. about twenty times longer than the probing pulses, a pump pulse energy of

≃

mJ is required, which can be obtained using a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd-based laser

system as a pump source.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a general analysis of the dispersive properties of QPM

optical parametric ampliﬁers. In the limit of no pump depletion, the parametric interaction

of idler and signal ﬁelds, that accounts for material dispersion at any order, may be described

by coupled-mode equations which have a canonical form widely encountered in problems of

inverse scattering and optical gratings and ﬁlters design. One of the main consequences

of the analysis is that the spectral power gain curve of the ampliﬁer deﬁnes univocally

its dispersive curve through a Hilbert-like transform. This circumstance may be of major

relevance in the design and synthesis of QPM ampliﬁers for applications in pulse shaping and

control, and imposes unavoidable physical limits to the realization of dispersionless ampliﬁers

with a ﬂat spectral gain [30]. Our analysis also demonstrates that engineered QPM grating

proﬁles can simulate dispersive properties of resonant pulse propagation in inverted atomic

media. In particular, in this work we have proposed and studied the possibility of observing

and controlling superluminal and negative group velocities of picosecond optical pulses in

a PPLN ampliﬁer, which shows features similar to those found in atomic ampliﬁers with a

gain doublet [18, 19, 20].

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF ENVELOPE EQUATIONS

In this Appendix we derive the envelope equations [Eqs.(8a)-(8c)] given in the text by a

multiple scale asymptotic analysis of the original equations [Eqs.(3a)-(3c)]. Such an analysis

assumes that the nonlinearity of the medium is weak and that the spectral extent of the

interacting ﬁelds is narrow enough such that in Eq.(5) the operator k2(ω0 + i∂t)

k2(ω0) can

−

be treated as a perturbation term. With these assumptions, it is worth rewriting Eqs.(3a)-

(3c) in the form:

on Z0, Z1, Z2, ..., where Z0 = z, Z1 = ǫz, Z2 = ǫ2z, ... The introduction of multiple

spatial scales is fundamental to remove secular growing terms that arise in the perturbation

than the crystal length and of the same order of magnitude as the wavelengths of interacting

[28] We note that, using Eq.(12b) and the property

M12, one realizes at once that the
generated idler wave at the output plane z = L of the ampliﬁer is given by: A2(L, t) =
∞

[30] A similar constraint occurs for the group delay in transmission of ﬁber Bragg gratings, which

can be uniquely determined from the amplitude response of the grating [see: L. Poladian,

Opt. Lett. 22, 1571 (1997)].

[34] A possible proﬁle may be obtained by imposing the minimal phase shift requirement for r(δ),

that is by choosing the phase of r(δ) using again a Hilbert transform. More complex methods,

that enable greater ﬂexibility in the design, have been recently discussed in [33].

[35] The occurrence of abnormal (i.e., superluminal or negative) group velocities in pulse propaga-

tion through either atomic or photonic structures has been demonstrated on several occasions

[see, for instance: R.Y. Chiao and A.M. Steinberg, Prog. Opt. 37, 345 (1997), and references

therein]; however, the existence of negative group velocities for pulse propagation in photonic

structures has been not yet predicted.

[36] In case of a Gaussian pulse envelope, a complex group delay as well as the inclusion of the

second-order term in the asymptotic expansion of Eq.(B7) do not change the functional form

of the pulse, however they change the eﬀective peak pulse delay, pulse duration and pulse

chirp. The role of the imaginary part of the complex delay time in the propagation of chirped

Gaussian pulses has been recently investigated in: G. D’Aguanno, M. Centini, M.J. Bloemer,

K. Myneni, M. Scalora, C.M. Bowden, C. Sibilia, and M. Bertolotti, Opt. Lett. 27, 176 (2002).

[37] For the case vg1 < vg2, the reverse argument may be applied, i.e. the eﬀective group velocity

becomes larger than vg1 when the pulse spectrum is tuned at a local maximum of the gain

curve. In this case, however, superluminal or negative transit times are unlikely. For instance,

for a periodic QPM ampliﬁer of length L [q(z) = q0 constant], the peak of the gain curve occurs

at Ω0 = 0 and it is given by G0 = cosh2(q0L); the corresponding group delay can be analyti-

cally calculated and reads τg = (L/2)(1/vg1 + 1/vg2) + (L/2)(1/vg1 −
The eﬀective group velocity, L/τg, is larger than vg1, however it is always smaller than vg2.

Fig.1 Schematic of parametric ampliﬁcation of a weak signal wave at frequency ω1

in a QPM nonlinear crystal pumped by a strong CW pump at frequency ω3 (copropagating

interaction).

Fig.2 PPLN crystal geometry.

In (a):

the crystal comprises two uniform grating

sections, each of length a, separated by a distance l with no grating structure.

In each

grating section, a +/- square periodic wave pattern of domains with period Λ is assumed.

This yields def f = (2/π)d33 in the ﬁrst grating and def f = exp(iΦ)(2/π)d33 in the second

grating, where the phase Φ is determined by the relative phase shift of square waves in

the two grating sections.

In (b) it is shown the QPM square wave proﬁle χ(2)(z) that

corresponds to Φ = π.

Fig.3 Behavior of spectral power gain (a) and group delay (b) for Φ = π. The

pump intensity is I3 = 135 MW/cm2. The other parameter values are given in the text.

Solid and dashed curves refer to the results obtained by use of Sellmeier equations, i.e.

taking into account dispersion at any order, and by use of approximate equations (22) given

in the text, respectively. The inset in (b) shows an enlargement of the group delay near

resonance.

Fig.4 Same as Fig.3, but for Φ = π/2.

Fig.5 Same as Fig.3, but for Φ = 0.

Fig.6 Behavior of group delay τg versus pump intensity I3 at the center of the am-

pliﬁer gain dip. Parameter values are the same as in Fig.3.

Fig.7 Traces of the intensity of transmitted signal pulse (solid curves) at the exit

plane z = L of the ampliﬁer for a few values of pump intensity. Curve 1: I3 = 0; curve 2:
I3 = 108 MW/cm2; curve 3: I3 = 135 MW/cm2; curve 4: I3 = 162 MW/cm2. The dashed

curve is the trace of incident Gaussian pulse at the input plane z = 0.

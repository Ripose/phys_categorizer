This letter presents a theoretical and experimental study on the viability of obtaining three dimensional super-
resolution (i.e. resolution overcoming the diffraction limit for all directions in space) by means of metamaterial
slab lenses. Although the source ﬁeld cannot be actually reproduced at the back side of the lens with super-
resolution in all space directions, the matching capabilities of metamaterial slabs does make it possible the
detection of images with three-dimensional super-resolution. This imaging takes place because of the coupling
between the evanescent space harmonic components of the ﬁeld generated at both the source and the detector.

It is well known from the early works of Veselago [1] that
a slab made of a left-handed medium will focus the electro-
magnetic energy coming from a point source to another point
located at the opposite side of the slab. An experimental con-
ﬁrmation of this focusing of energy has been reported in [2].
Subsequent works [3, 4, 5] have shown that, under some cir-
cumstances, metamaterial lenses can produce images at cer-
tain planes with a resolution beyond the classical diffraction
limit, or “super resolution imaging” (SRI). This SRI has been
attributed to an ampliﬁcation, inside the lens, of the evanes-
cent Space Fourier Harmonics (SFHs) coming from the source
[3]. In [6] it has been also discussed that this process gives
rise to ﬁelds that decay exponentially from the lens towards
the image, which causes super-resolution to take place only
in planes parallel to the slab interfaces. In the direction per-
pendicular to the lens, a strong decay of the ﬁeld is observed,
and thus a three dimensional (3D) picture of the source can-
not be obtained from the ﬁeld pattern at the back side of the
lens. In other words, super-resolution in the transverse direc-
tions is obtained at the price of a drastic loss of resolution
in the longitudinal direction. This fact has been corroborated
by the ﬁeld measurements recently reported in [4], where the
ﬁeld growth from the image plane to the “super lens” can be
clearly appreciated. Other experimental results also lead to the
same conclussion, showing that images “of ﬁnite depth” [5]
cannot be directly obtained from ﬁeld measurements in SRI
experiments. Although the above facts seem to be well stab-
lished, new experimental results recently reported by some of
the authors [7] have suggested the possibility of also obtain-
ing super-resolution in the longitudinal direction or, in other
words, three-dimensional super-resolution imaging (3D-SRI).
In these experiments, a 3D map of a point-like source (i.e. a
source of sub-wavelength size) was obtained at the image side
of the lens. The aim of the present letter is then to provide the
general theory underlying this 3D-SRI. It will be shown that
3D-SRI of point-like sources is actually a general property of
metamaterial slabs when the appropriate detection procedure
is followed.

The main difference between SRI and more conventional
imaging processes is that, in the former one, the information
for the image formation is carried out by evanescent SFHs [3]

whereas in conventional imaging the information is carried
out by the propagative SFHs. Since evanescent ﬁelds can-
not carry power, and any image measurement requires some
power transmission, it is apparent that the dectection of a
super-resolution image should substantially affect the ﬁelds
around the detector. This intrinsic perturbation of the ﬁelds
in a super-resolution image detection resembles the problem
of the tunneling effect. As is well known, tunneling of power
is due to the excitation of a pair of evanescent electromag-
netic waves, whose interference gives rise to a non-vanishing
ﬂux of power. “Perfect tunneling” of power in a waveguide
ﬁlled by a metamaterial has been recently reported by some
of the authors in [8]. In this work it is shown that maximum
tunneling of power in a setup with identical input and output
waveguides is achieved when the output is placed at a distance
from the input equal to that from the source to the image in a
metamaterial super-lens. This suggests that a similar effect
could take place in a metamaterial super-lens, provided that a
detector identical to the source is used for the measurements.
In the following it will be shown how we can take advantage
of such effect in order to obtain 3D-SRI with metamaterial
slabs.

FIG. 1: Geometry of a metamaterial lens. The source is a loop
antenna located at z = 0. The detector is also an identical loop an-
tenna. The lens is formed either by a left-handed metamaterial slab or
by another planar device that produces SRI through ampliﬁcation of
evanescent harmonics. The output antenna can eventually be loaded
with microwave resistors in order to minimize ﬁeld perturbation.

The present study starts with the canonical problem of the
formation of images by a left-handed slab of thickness d char-
acterized by ǫ/ǫ0 = µ/µ0 = −1 + iδ, where δ ≪ 1 accounts
for the necessary losses factor to avoid the divergence of ﬁeld
integrals [9, 10, 11].
In our study, and following an usual
procedure in microwave SRI experiments, the source will be
an antenna (speciﬁcally, a loop antenna) whose plane is lo-
cated parallel to the slab interfaces, as is shown in Fig. 1. The
ﬁeld beyond the lens will be scanned by an output antenna
that plays the role of detector. The source here employed
is equivalent to an homogeneous surface distribution of mag-
netic dipoles inside the loop given by Ms = I0e−iωt, where I
denotes the amplitude of the imposed time-harmonic current
in the loop. The computation of the longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld, Hz, at the image side of the slab (z > ∆ + d) can be
carried out by means of the following double inverse Fourier
transform:

maining ﬁeld components can be all deduced from Hz [11].

The numerical computation of (1) provides the map de-
picted in Fig. 2 for the magnitude of Hz in the (x − z) plane
at the back side of the lens. It should be noted that, given that
the operation frequency is 3 GHz (λ0 = 100 mm) and d and
∆ are taken much less than the free-space wavelength, the ray
model approximation cannot be here employed to obtain the
ﬁelds in the considered region (in other words, we are dealing
with near ﬁelds and therefore in a SRI situation). According
to previous discussions, Fig. 2 shows that the ﬁeld magnitude
has a strong decay along the z direction, so that no informa-
tion about the location of the source in this direction can be
extracted from the ﬁeld pattern. A more detailed picture of
the ﬁeld distribution at two planes z = (2 ± δ)d is depicted in
Fig. 3 (with δ set to 0.3), and compared with the ﬁeld ampli-
tude near the source at z = ±δd (both results are identical).
As is expected from the properties of the metamaterial slab,
the ﬁeld distribution at the z = (2+δ)d plane is almost identi-
cal to that at the z = δd plane, thus conﬁrming that the z = δd
and the z = (2 + δ)d planes are in fact conjugate planes. On
the contrary, the ﬁeld distribution at the z = (2 − δ)d plane
substantially differs in magnitude from the ﬁeld distribution

at the z = −δ plane, near the source. These facts corrobo-
rate the aforementioned discussions: the super-resolution in
the transverse directions (the lateral dimensions of the source
and the image are of about one tenth of the wavelength) is
compensated by an almost complete loss of resolution in the
longitudinal direction.

Next, the problem of the measurement of the image in this
SRI experiment will be considered. In the microwave range,
the image detection is performed by measuring the transmis-
sion coefﬁcient between a source antenna and a receiving an-
tenna, which is scanned in the image side of the lens [2, 4, 5].
For simplicity the receiving (or output) antenna will be as-
sumed to be identical to the input antenna employed as source.
The transmission coefﬁcient is measured by connecting the
input antenna to a wave generator via a waveguide, and the

(more details of this measurement setup are reported in [7]).
In this approach, the metamaterial slab should be viewed as
a matching device [12], whose transmission coefﬁcient, t (or
S21 in the usual microwave terminology), is given by [13]

where Zij are the elements of the impedance matrix for the
system formed by the two antennas and the left-handed slab,
and Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the input/output
waveguide. In order to measure a super-resolution image, the
size of the loop antennas has to be smaller than the free space
wavelength, which additionally would make the real part of
Zij (the radiation resistance [13]) be negligible with respect
to its imaginary part; namely, Zij ≃ −iωLij, where Lij
is the inductance matrix of the system. The diagonal terms
of the inductance matrix correspond to the inductances of a
single loop antenna faced to the left-handed slab. However,
in the “perfect lens” conﬁguration here considered, the slab
does not affect the ﬁelds around the source [3] and, therefore,
L11 = L22 ≡ L, where L is the self-inductance of the loops
in free space. The non-diagonal terms of the inductance ma-
trix account for the mutual inductance of the loop antennas
in the presence of the slab, namely L12 = L21 ≡ M . As-
suming that the waveguides have a low impedance (typically
this impedance is Z0 = 50 Ω for microwave measurements),
it will be found that |Zii| > Z0. Thus, neglecting second or-
der terms in Zii/Z0, the transmission coefﬁcient in (3) can be
approximated as

t ≈

2iωM Z0
ω2(L2 − M 2) + 2iωL

.

Note that the only spatial dependence in (4) comes from M

3

(since L does not change with the position of the antennas),
which causes that the transmission coefﬁcient reaches its max-
imum (|t| = 1) at those points where M → L. Since both the
input and output antennas are identical, and the ﬁeld at the
source plane is reproduced at the image plane (see Fig. 3), the
condition M → L is expected to be satisﬁed around the point
In consequence, a maximum of the
(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 2d).
transmitted power should be detected at this particular point,
which thus appears as an “effective focusing point” of the per-
fect lens.

In order to show the above expected effects in a practical sit-
uation, the magnitude of the transmission coefﬁcient has been
numerically computed for the conﬁguration under study. The
impedance matrix has been calculated by imposing known
currents, Ii = 1, 0 A, in the loops, and then computing the
corresponding self and mutual inductances. The computation
of the self inductance is an standard electromagnetic problem,
and the mutual inductance is obtained after computing the ﬂux
of the magnetic ﬁeld given by (1) across the surface of the
output antenna. The transmission coefﬁcient is ﬁnally deter-
mined from (3), assuming Z0 = 50 Ω. In Fig. 4 it is shown
a map of the computed transmission coefﬁcient for a system
composed of two identical lossless loop antennas. It can be
observed that this ﬁgure substantially differs from Fig. 2; in
particular, a clear maximum of |t| can be observed in Fig. 4
in the neighborhood of the image at (0, 0, 2d). These results
clearly show the difference between the transmitted power and
the ﬁeld distribution in the absence of the output antenna, and
also how 3D-SRI can be obtained when the appropriate detec-
tor is used.

Let us now consider the measurement of the unperturbed
ﬁeld. For this purpose, the detector should be designed to
affect the ﬁeld distribution as less as possible.
It could be
closely achieved by loading the output antenna with an ad-
ditional high resistance, which will signiﬁcantly reduce the
current induced at the output antenna, as well as its gener-
ated ﬁeld. In Fig. 5 the computed values of the transmission

coefﬁcient along the z-axis of Fig. 1 are shown for different
resistances, R, loading the output antenna. As is expected, the
curve for R = 0 shows a maximum near the location of the
image, which thus appears as a “focusing point” of the lens,
at z = 2d. (The small difference between the actual location
of this maximum and z = 2d can be attributed to the non neg-
ligible values of the ratio |Zii/Z0| ≈ 8 in the problem under
study). As is expected, the curves for the highest values of
R resemble the behavior of |Hz| in Fig. 2 for the unperturbed
conﬁguration.

Let us now re-examine the experimental demonstration of
3D-SRI, recently reported in [7] at the light of the above con-
siderations. Although the underlying physics of the device
analyzed in [7] is not exactly the same as that of the left-
handed perfect lens, both systems show the same process of
ampliﬁcation of evanescent modes and are equivalent in prac-
tice for the present purposes. Fig. 6 shows the location of the
maximum of the transmission coefﬁcient along the z axis of
the magnetoinductive lens reported in [7], for different values
of the resistance loading the output loop. The experimental
setup used to obtain these results is described in detail in [7].
The only difference is that, for obtaining the results shown in
Fig. 6, the output antenna was loaded by different microwave
resistors. A behavior similar to that of Fig. 5 can be observed,
thus conﬁrming the proposed theory.

lens will require the existence of some amount of transmit-
ted power from the source to the detector, which can signif-
icantly affect the ﬁeld distribution. If this last effect is taken
into account, the secondary ﬁelds generated by the presence of
the detector should be considered. Following this approach,
it has been shown that the transmission coefﬁcient between
the source and the detector can be made very high. Provided
that the appropriate detector is employed (typically a lossless
output antenna identical to the input antenna), this maximum
will occur in a neighborhood of the image, thus resulting in
super-resolution imaging also in the direction perpendicular
to the slab. However, it should be emphasized that, to obtain
this 3D-SRI some previous knowledge of the source is neces-
sary in order to properly design the detector. Thus, a general
conclusion arises from the analysis: Super-resolution in meta-
material super-lenses is always incomplete: if the distance
from the source to the lens is known, the shape and charac-
teristics of the source can be recovered without uncertainty
from the analysis of the ﬁeld at the image side of the lens.
Conversely, if the shape and characteristics of the source are
known, it is possible to design an appropriate detector in or-
der to determine, without uncertainty, the source location in
three dimensional space from the transmission coefﬁcient be-
tween the source and the detector. However, it is impossible
to determine simultaneously, by means of a metamaterial su-
perlens, both the locations and the shape and characteristics
of an unknown source wit a resolution overcoming the diffrac-
tion limit. We feel that the reported analysis and experiments,
as well as the conclusions arising from them, will be of impor-
tance in the design of metamaterial super-resolution devices.

In summary, SRI in metamaterial super-lenses has been in-
vestigated. As is well known this imaging is primarily due
to the ampliﬁcation of evanescent modes inside the lens. As
a consequence, super-resolution in the planes parallel to the
slab is unavoidably compensated by a drastic loss of resolu-
tion in the direction perpendicular to the slab. However, since
evanescent modes do not carry power, any physical detection
(namely, a measurement) of the image at the back side of the

Spontaneous and stimulated emission of an electron in the ion channel is studied. The emission
processes are studied in the regime of high harmonic generation when the parameter of plasma
wiggler strength is large. Like for conventional free electron laser, a synchrotron-like broadband
spectrum is generated in this regime. The asymptotic expression for the radiation spectrum of the
spontaneous emission is derived. The radiation spectrum emitted from axisymmetric monoenergetic
electron beam is analyzed. The gain of ion-channel synchrotron-radiation laser is calculated. Use
of laser-produced ion channel for eﬃcient X-ray generation is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

An electron dynamics in plasma-focusing channel has important applications to new plasma technologies, such as
advanced accelerators [1], novel radiation sources, new types of lens [2]. It is a key phenomenon for ion-channel laser
(ICL) [3], ion-ripple laser [4], plasma-wiggler free electron laser(FEL) [5], which are perspective candidates for high
brightness X-ray radiation sources. Such radiation sources are strongly needed for experimental research in physics,
chemistry, biology and in engineering [6].

Resent experiments that explore the interaction of intense 28.5-GeV electron beam with plasma at Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) [7, 8] have shown that ion channel can be successfully used to produce broadband X-ray
radiation. Moreover, the high density of the ions in the channel provides much higher wiggler strength than that
provided by a conventional magnet wiggler. This leads to a more eﬀective generation of X-ray radiation than in
conventional light sources and could be used for the development of next generation of radiation sources.

To create ion channel, electron beam have to interact with plasma in blow-out regime [9] when the electron beam
density, nb, is higher than plasma density, np. In this regime the electron beam charge quasistatically expels slow
plasma electrons inside and around the beam volume and the ion channel is formed. Note that relativistic electrons of
the beam are not expelled from the channel because of relativistic compensation of the beam electron charge force by
the self-magnetic force [10]. The channel radius, ri ≃
nb/np is much more than electron beam radius, r0, for dense

is the plasma frequency, e is the electron charge, m is the electron mass and c is the speed of light. If all plasma
electrons are expelled from the channel then the restoring force on the beam electrons due to the ion charge is given
by Gauss’s low and in cylindrical geometry is:

where r⊥ is the vector from an electron to the channel axis. The beam electrons in the ion channel will undergo betatron

oscillations caused by this force. The wavelength for small betatron oscillations is close to λb = 2π/kb ≃
where γ is the relativistic factor of the electron beam [12].

It is well known that accelerated charges emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation [13]. Therefore the electrons under-
going betatron oscillations in ion channel will emit short-wavelength EM radiation. Some features of this radiation
spectrum have been studied in Ref.
for small-
amplitude near-axis betatron oscillations. If the amplitude of the betatron oscillations becomes large then electron
radiates high harmonics. If the plasma wiggler strength,

It follows from Eq. (5) that the radiated power is proportional to the squared density of ions in the channel. This fact
has been conﬁrmed in the experiments [7]. As it was mentioned above the ion density in the channel have to be less
than electron density in the beam. This leads to the serious limits on the gain in radiated power. One of the ways
to overcome the limits is to use laser-produced ion channel. The ion density in such channel can be about 1019cm−3
[15, 16] that is in 5 order higher than ion density in the channel produced in beam - plasma interaction experiments
[7]. So use of ion channel produced by laser pulse could increase the power of X-ray radiation in 1010 times! More
detailed discussion on use of relativistic laser channel for X-ray generation will be presented in Conclusion.

Spontaneous emission in an ion channel has been studied in detail in Ref. [14]. The general expression for the

spectrum has been derived.
Numerical evaluation of the spectrum becomes diﬃcult in the limit K
1. The simple asymptotic expression for the
angular dependence of the radiated spectrum has been derived for this limit only for directions that are perpendicular
to the plane of the betatron oscillation. The one of the purposes of our paper is to calculated the total angular
dependence of the radiated spectrum.

≫

Resonance interaction between EM radiation and the betatron oscillations of electron beam in ion channel leads to
the bunching of the electron beam and then to the ampliﬁcation (or damping) of EM radiation. It is a stimulated
emission (or absorption). Stimulated emission is a basic process in ICLs [3] and FELs [17]. Reverse process -
stimulated absorption leads to the direct laser acceleration [18] and to the magnetic ﬁeld generation [19] in relativistic
laser channel. Unfortunately stimulated emission (absorption) in ion channel has not yet been explored in the limit
K

1 that is another objective of our paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II the motion of an electron is studied and Hamiltonian formulation of
the problem is presented. In Section III, the spontaneous emission from electrons undergoing betatron oscillations in
ion channel is analyzed. The general asymptotic expression of the radiation spectrum for arbitrary angular dependence
1. The spectrum averaged over azimuthal angle is calculated for axially symmetrical electron beam
is derived for K
in the limit K
1. Section IV discusses the stimulated emission processes. The gain of ion - channel synchrotron -
radiation laser is derived. A summary discussion is presented in Sec. V.

II. ELECTRON DYNAMICS IN ION CHANNEL

Relativistic equation of electron motion in cylindrical ion channel is

dp

= Fres,

where Fres is the restoring force deﬁned by Eq. (1). It follows from Eq. (8) that momentum along channel axis pz
is a constant of motion. First we will consider the radial betatron oscillation as it takes place when the center of an
electron bunch moves along the channel axis. Assuming that py = 0 we get the equation for x -coordinate:

where we introduce the constant of motion γ2
the length to c/ωp, the momentum to mc.

z = 1 + p2

III. SPONTANEOUS EMISSION

Using Eqs. (22) - (24) for electron trajectory, the energy spectrum radiated by an electron can be calculated [13, 14].
The total radiation ﬂux can be separated in two independent components with polarization in the eθ and eφ directions,
where unit vectors eθ and eφ correspond to spherical coordinate system: x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ, z = r cos θ.
Then energy radiated per frequency ω per solid angle in the direction k = (ω/c) (ex sin θ cos φ + ey sin θ sin φ + ez cos θ)
during the interaction time T is [14]:

where j = θ, φ is the polarization index, the electron trajectory is given by Eqs. (22) - (24) and η = ω/ωp. The ﬁnal
results can be expressed as double inﬁnite series of the Bessel function products (see Eqs. (32) - (41) in Ref. [14] or
can be expressed by the inﬁnite series of the generalized Bessel function introduced in quantum electrodynamics [21]).
Unfortunately the series converge slowly in the limit K
1 that makes the numerical evaluation of the radiation
≫
spectrum diﬃcult. Energy spectrum and angular dependence of radiation have been derived only for directions that
are perpendicular to the plane of the betatron oscillation (i. e., for φ = π/2) [14]. To extend this result we will use
saddle point method [22] to evaluate integrals (26) and (27).

It is well known that radiation of accelerated relativistic electron is beamed in a very narrow cone in the direction
of the electron momentum vector, and is seen by the observer as a short pulse of radiation as the searchlight beam
sweeps across the observation point [13] (see Fig. 2). So the time moments when the electron momentum, p, is
directed along wave number, k, give the main contribution in integrals ( 26) and (27). As the pulse duration is very
short it is necessary to know the electron momentum and the electron position over only a small arc of the trajectory
whose tangent points in the direction that is close to the direction of k. Then we can expand integrand in Eqs. (26)
and (27) about this time moments and perform integration. This approach implies that we approximate the part
of the electron trajectory near these time moments by the arc of a circular path [13].
In this case the radiation
will have well-known synchrotron-like spectrum. It is noted in Ref. [23] that another necessary (the ﬁrst is that the
electron have to be relativistic) condition for use of the synchrotron radiation approach is that the electron deﬂection
angle should be much more than simultaneous angle spread to which radiation is emitted. The electron momentum
p⊥/pz (electron deﬂection angle). The radiation of the relativistic particle is conﬁned to
oscillates in cone angle
1/γ that is equivalent to the
angle 1/γ [13]. So the validity condition for synchrotron radiation approach is p⊥/pz ≫
condition for high harmonics generation discussed in Introduction K
1. Therefore the radiation spectrum can be
approximated by the synchrotron one if

This condition is easily satisﬁed in experiments.

Notice that it is suﬃcient to keep the leading term in the pre-exponent factor while only terms that are much less

For simplicity we assume that py = 0 that is the electron orbit is plane and the betatron oscillations is radial. It

It is seen from Eq. (47) and Fig. 3 that the number of saddle points is 2Nb = ωbT /π that is the number of times when
the direction of the electron momentum and the direction of the wave number coincides. It can be shown [13] that
the second-order term can be neglected in Eq. (30). Then Eqs.(26) and (27) take a form:

To visualize our results we use new angle coordinates θx = sin θ cos φ, θy = sin θ sin φ instead of the spherical one
(θ, ϕ) (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). It is seen from Fig. 3 that there is no radiation for θx > θmax because the argument
of the Bessel function in Eq. (57) goes to inﬁnity and the Bessel function goes to zero for θx = θmax. Therefore
in our approximation the emission angle along x-axis is conﬁned to the electron deﬂection angle θmax = px/pz.
However it is evident that electrons with maximal deﬂection angle radiation px/pz emit radiation up to the angle
θ =
1/γ in the direction of y-axis which is normal to
the electron orbit plane. Hence our results agree with the qualitative analysis in Ref. [14].

IV. STIMULATED SYNCHROTRON RADIATION IN ION CHANNEL

When EM wave of approximately the same frequency as the spontaneous emission is driven through the ion channel
simultaneously with the electron beam, a signiﬁcant exchange of energy between the beam and the wave can occur
and can lead to the coherent eﬃcient ampliﬁcation of the wave energy. This ampliﬁcation can be explained in terms
of the stimulated emission processes which is determined the operation of ICL. Unlike ICL theory [3], here we will
consider regime of strong wiggler (K
1) when the emission process is close to synchrotron one. This is the regime
of ion-channel synchrotron-radiation laser (ICSRL).

≫

The diﬀerence between spontaneous and stimulated emissions is the following. The radiation ﬁelds generated by
an electron undergoing betatron oscillations has a phase which depends on time of arrival of the electrons at the
channel entrance. The ﬁelds produced by diﬀerent electrons in a uniform input beam have a random phase relation
to each other and sum up incoherently. This lead to incoherent spontaneous radiation. Contrary to the spontaneous
emission, electrons in ion channel can be driven by an external EM wave in synchronous oscillation, the phase of which
is no longer random but locked to the phase of the wave. As a result the external wave causes the bunching of the
electron beam and more eﬃcient interaction between the beam and the wave. Then the radiation ﬁelds of diﬀerent
electrons sum up coherently to each other and to the external wave, leading either to a decrease or to an increase of
the power, depending on whether destructive or constructive interference is realized. So the external wave is either
absorbed or ampliﬁed. In quantum approach the ampliﬁcation/absorption can be viewed as a transition, forced by
the external wave, between the quantum states of the electron in the ion channel with photon absorption/emission.
An ampliﬁcation process of this kind is called a stimulated emission. It is known from laser physics that stimulated
emission can be much more eﬃcient and powerful than spontaneous one.

As known in quantum physics [24] there is the relation between the spontaneous and stimulated emission. Using
this fact the elementary quantum methods based on the Einstein’s coeﬃcients have been used to study the instability
of EM waves in cosmic plasmas [25]. Particularly, the synchrotron instability in a cold magnetoactive plasmas has
been identiﬁed [26]. The relation between spontaneous and stimulated emission of the electrons in undulators is called

Madey’s theorem in the theory of FELs [27]. It can be considered as extension of Einstein’s coeﬃcient method to the
classical limit. Generalized Madey’s theorem [17] enables us to reduce the problem of ICSRL gain to the problem
solved in Sec. III that is the calculation of the power of spontaneous emission in ion channel.

To use Madey’s theorem we should formulate the problem within Hamiltonian approach. An electron motion in an

ion channel and in EM wave can be described by a relativistic Hamiltonian

where Ai is the vector potential of the wave with θ or φ polarizations (i = θ, φ):

Hamiltonian (66) is again written in the dimensionless units, normalizing the time to ω−1
p , the length to c/ωp, the
momentum to mc, the vector potential to mc2/e. As usual we assume that the time of arrival of the electrons at the
channel entrance is random. Assuming that external EM wave is weak we can consider it as perturbation and use
the perturbation theory to calculate the work done upon the electron beam by EM wave with j-polarization. Then it
follows from the generalized Madey’s theorem (see Eq. (5.52) in Ref. [17]) that this work per beam electron is

γ0 and p⊥ are the electron energy and the transversal momentum of the electron before the interaction. The unper-
turbed electron trajectory r0(t) is determined by Eqs. (22) - (24). Averaging in Eq. (69) implies the averaging over
the time of arrival of the electrons at the channel entrance. Mathematical statement of the Madey’s theorem is that
the second-order quantity,
, is proportional to the average squared ﬁrst-order quantities, γ1,j. Therefore Madey’s
theorem essentially simpliﬁes calculations in the framework of the perturbation theory. Using instead of variables γ0
and p⊥ the initial value of the electron momentum p = (p⊥, pz), Eq. (69) can be also rewritten in more symmetric
form

It has been noted in previous Section that eﬃcient spontaneous emission in direction k takes place only at a
short moment of time when the electron moment is directed along k. Therefore we can conclude from Eq. (74)
that interaction with EM wave propagating in direction of k is only possible at the same moments of time. It was
mentioned in Sec. III (see Fig. 3) that the number of the interactions moments is 2Nb. The number of the electron

oscillations in EM wave between interaction moments is extremely large: NEMW ≃

can be rewritten as follows

For simplicity we assume that py = 0. To take derivatives in Eq. (75) we should present dWspon,j

dωdΩ as a function of
momentum, p, and use the simplifying assumptions py = 0 only after performing diﬀerentiation in Eq. (75). This
is because the electron motion in the ion channel and in EM wave is no longer plane. Although the unperturbed
betatron oscillations is in the plane y = 0 the action of EM wave leads to the small oscillations along y-axis in the
ﬁrst-order of perturbation theory.

are given in radians.

We have also checked the obtained results by the numerical diﬀerentiation for some values of parameters. EM wave
can be ampliﬁed only if the wave propagates in some small angle to the axis z. It is seen from Fig. 4 that there is no
ampliﬁcation of EM wave when the wave propagates along the channel axis.

Eqs. (53) and (52) have been derived under assumption that all electrons have the same momentum before inter-
action. Now we will consider a monoenergetic, axisymmetric electron beam with electron distribution function given
by Eq. (62). ICSRL gain for such electron beam is deﬁned by the relation

We have performed integration in Eq. (79) numerically. It is seen from Fig. 5 that there is no ampliﬁcation of EM
wave by the beam φ for given parameters. We are not able to ﬁnd the wave ampliﬁcation by the axisymmetric electron
beam at least for considered beam parameters.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

First we would like to discuss the use a laser-produced ion channel for X-ray generation. As it was mentioned in
Introduction an ion channel in plasma can be produced by an electron beam itself. However in this case the plasma
density have to be less than beam density. Unfortunately the density of relativistic beam cannot be very high because
of technology reasons. This leads to the serious limitation on the gain in radiated power as the power is quadratic
in plasma density. Use of high-power laser could overcome this limitation. High-power laser pulse can expel plasma

”bubble” regime [16] electrons are completely evacuated from the ﬁrst half-plasma wave excited behind the laser
pulse. The ion density in this ”bubble” is higher in many order of magnitude than that in the ion channel formed
in the beam - plasma interaction. For example, the ion density in the ”bubble” can be as high as 1019cm−3 [15, 16]
that is in 105 times higher than that in the beam - plasma interaction experiments [7]. Therefore the radiated power
in laser-produced channel can be in 1010 times higher than that in the experiments [7] for the same number of the
betatron oscillations. The ”bubble” moves with group velocity of the laser pulse which is close to the speed of light.
Relativistic electron bunch injected into the ”bubble” can propagate inside the ”bubble” over a long distance. Hence,
in spite of the small length of the ”bubble” the electrons can oscillate in the ”bubble” a lot of time.

It should be noted that the self-generated forces of the electron bunch as well as of the relativistic plasma electrons
in the column can be neglected because they cancel each other [10]. The condition to neglect the self-generated forces
niγ2 that is easily satisﬁed in modern experiments. The number of the betatron oscillations performed by an

increase the power of X-ray emission.

In this paper we have studied spontaneous and stimulated emission from electrons undergoing betatron motion in
ion channel. We calculate the period of nonlinear betatron oscillations. The method based on the Bessel function
expansion is used in Ref. [14] to calculate the spectrum of the spontaneous emission in ion channel. However, in
synchrotron regime of emission (K >> 1) the angular distribution of the radiation has been derived in this paper only
in the direction which is perpendicular to the electron orbit plane. We extended this result to the arbitrary directions.
The generalized Madey’s theorem was used to calculate the electron energy gain of ICSRL. The calculation shows
that there is no wave ampliﬁcation when the EM wave propagates along the channel axis and the ampliﬁcation takes
place only when the wave propagates at some small angle to the channel axis.

Our numerical simulations show that there is no ampliﬁcation for axisymmetric electron beam at least for considered
parameters of the beam. However further analysis is required to justify this conclusion. It may be possible to overcome
this diﬃculty by appropriately tailoring the electron beam, that is, a narrow electron beam could be injected oﬀ-axis
such that all of the beam electrons execute approximately the same betatron orbit.

To calculate the radiation spectrum and the gain of ICSRL for electron beam, we used a very simple distribution
function. Further investigations should include the more realistic electron distribution functions. The gain of ICSRL
was calculated in the small-signal small-gain limit. However, it is more interesting for application is to explore
large-gain regime of ICSRL that needs further investigations.

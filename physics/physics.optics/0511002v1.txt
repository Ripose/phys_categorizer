We calculate the characteristics of ultraslow light in an inhomogeneously broadened medium. We
present analytical and numerical results for the group delay as a function of power of the propagating
pulse. We apply these results to explain the recently reported saturation behavior [Baldit et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 143601 (2005)] of ultraslow light in rare earth ion doped crystal.

The usage of a coherent ﬁeld to control the opti-
cal properties of a medium has led to many remark-
able results such as enhanced nonlinear optical eﬀects
[1, 2], electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
[3],
lasing without inversion [4, 5, 6], ultraslow light
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11], storage and retrieval of optical pulses [12]
and many others [13, 14, 15, 16]. Most of these eﬀects
rely on quantum interferences which are created by the
application of a coherent ﬁeld. The coherent ﬁeld opens
up a new channel for the process under consideration.
This interference eﬀect produces the EIT dip or a hole in
the absorption proﬁle. The ultraslow light emerges as the
EIT dip could be very narrow. It has been realized that
in principle one could also use two level nonlinearities in
presence of a strong pump. For a homogeneously broad-
ened medium a hole can emerge if the transverse and
longitudinal relaxation times are quite diﬀerent. Under
these conditions the hole has a width of the order of T1
and this is being referred to as the eﬀect of coherent pop-
ulation oscillation [17]. Bigelow et al. did experiments
in this regime using ruby as the material medium which
can be modelled as a homogeneously broadened system
[18, 19]. Some studies on slowlight in inhomogeneous
broadened medium exist [20, 21].
In an earlier paper
the present authors had considered the case of inhomo-
geneously broadened gaseous medium where the Doppler
eﬀect is important [21]. We considered the case of sat-
uration absorption spectroscopy. This leads to the well
known hole in the Doppler proﬁle. The width of this hole
was of the order of 1/T1 which is about two times 1/T2.
In the inhomogeneously broadened gaseous medium the
group index of the order of 103 was obtained. The re-
cent experiment of Baldit et al. reports group delays of
the order of 1.1 s in rare earth ion doped crystal which
has strong inhomogeneous broadening [22]. In this case
all the relaxation times are quite diﬀerent - T1 = 8 ms;
T2 = 3 µs; inhomogeneous line width Γinh = 1.3 GHz.
The width of the whole is essentially determined by T1
and hence one gets very large delays. Baldit et al. did
present a theoretical model based on homogeneous broad-
ening of the medium where as to obtain agreement with

experiments inhomogeneous broadening is to be included
as alluded by them [23].

In this paper, we consider a system of inhomoge-
neously broadened two level atoms interacting with co-
propagating pump and probe ﬁelds. We use the well
known susceptibility [24] and average it over the inho-
mogeneous distribution to calculate the group index. We
derive a number of analytical results and show how these
can be used to understand the experimental results of
Baldit et al. For example we show that in the limit of very
small detuning of the probe from the pump the group de-
lay goes as √S for large S. The group delay also peaks
at about S=0.9. The value of group delay increases as
the detuning δ increases. We further present detailed
numerical results.

In order to understand the experimental results of
Baldit et al, we consider a two level system as shown
in ﬁgure 1. Here we deﬁne all ﬁelds as

~Ei(z, t) = ~

Ei(z, t) e

−i(ωit−kz) + c.c., (i = p, c)

(1)

where ~
Ei is the slowly varying envelope of the ﬁeld. The
pump ﬁeld at frequency ωc and the probe ﬁeld at fre-
quency ωp are co-propagating through the medium. The
linear susceptibility χ(ωp) is obtained by solving the den-
sity matrix equations for the two level system of ﬁgure 1,
that is by calculating the density matrix element ρeg to
the ﬁrst order in the probe ﬁeld but to all orders in the
co-propagating pump ﬁeld. The dynamics of population
and polarization of the atoms in the two-level conﬁgura-

tion are given by

on the intensity of the control ﬁeld. This dip is associated
with coherent population oscillation[17].

It is clear from the above expression that the group in-
dex varies as S−1/2 for large value of S. The group index
attains the maximum value at S = 0.9. In case of homo-
geneously broadened two level system the group index is
given by [22]

2T2/c~ is the homogeneous ab-
where αh = 4πωpn
sorption coeﬃcient. For homogeneous two level system
the group index varies as S−2 at large S and peaks at
S=0.5. At large S, the group index for a two level sys-
tem falls much slowly for an inhomogeneous medium as
compared to the homogeneous case as shown in Fig. (3).
We thus ﬁnd an important diﬀerence between inhomoge-
neously and homogeneously broadened two level systems.
Note that the ratio between inhomogeneous and homo-
geneous unsaturated absorption coeﬃcient is αinh/αh ≈
ΓinhT2. The behavior so obtained is consistent with the
experimental observation. Figure (4) shows the varia-
tion of group index as function of the intensity of the
control ﬁeld at diﬀerent probe detuning. As the detun-
ing of the probe ﬁeld is increased the peak of the group
index shifts toward higher S. The maxima of the group
108 for δ = 10 Hz occurs at S = 1.16
index ng = .65
which corresponds to the group velocity vg = c/ng = 4.61
m/s which is higher than what is reported. Further the

ﬁgure (5) shows the variation of the group index ng cal-
culated from the Eq. (7) with the detuning of the probe
ﬁeld δ for saturation parameter S=1.

In conclusion, we have discussed the characteristics
of ultraslow light in an inhomogeneously broadened
medium. Our numerical and analytical results enable

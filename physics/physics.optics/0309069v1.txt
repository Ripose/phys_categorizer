Abstract. Generic wave dislocations (phase singularities, optical vortices) have
anisotropic local structure, which is analysed, with emphasis on the twist of surfaces
of equal phase along the singular line, and the rotation of the local anisotropy ellipse
(twirl). Various measures of twist and twirl are compared in speciﬁc examples, and
a theorem is found relating the (quantised) topological twist and twirl for a closed
dislocation loop with the anisotropy C line index threading the loop.

Phase singularity lines in 3-dimensional scalar waves, that is, nodal lines or wave
dislocations [1, 2], are often called (optical) vortices since they are vortices of current
(energy) ﬂow. Being places where the phase is singular, all phases are found in the vortex
neighbourhood, and the phase change is arbitrarily fast. The surfaces on which phase
is constant all meet on the nodal line, and are often twisted around the singularity as
helicoids, as with the familiar screw dislocations [1]; the total phase structure transverse
to the dislocation line changes along the line, by various rotations and deformations.

My aim here is to describe this 3-dimensional phase twist structure in the general
case, illustrated by simple examples of dislocated waves. The main complication comes
from the fact that diﬀerent phase helicoids twist at diﬀerent rates, and this must
somehow be averaged to give a sense of dislocation twist. Related is the fact that the
local phase structure transverse to a dislocation line is generically anisotropic, squeezed
into an ellipse [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], complicating the averaging around the dislocation.

1. Introduction

I shall use the notation of [4, 5]. In particular, ψ = ψ(r) denotes a complex scalar

wave, and in terms of real and imaginary parts, or amplitude and phase,

ψ = ξ + iη = ρ exp(iχ).

(1.1)

Time dependence will not be considered here, and terms such as twist and twirl refer to
variation with distance, not time. Local cartesian coordinates r = (x, y, z) or cylindrical
coordinates R, φ, z will be used, with the dislocation along x = y = r = 0, and phase
χ increasing with φ (that is, the topological current is parallel to the +z-direction,
Important formulae will be given in coordinate-free form,
rather than antiparallel).

(subscripts denote partial derivatives), and coordinates are local. The dislocation (1.2)
has Burgers vector b = k, which is the wavevector of the asymptotic plane wave. This
gives the expected results of the vector being parallel and perpendicular to the screw
and edge dislocation lines respectively. However, there is a danger of taking the analogy
between wave dislocations and crystal dislocations too far, and this deﬁnition of a wave
Burgers vector has several serious problems.

Firstly, the deﬁnition depends on careful choice of the local coordinates x, y, z for
which the limits are taken. The x and y axes were chosen in [10] with respect to
the transverse motion of the dislocation (in a narrow-band wave); for monochromatic
waves, the dislocation is stationary. bz, as a measure of the screwness of a dislocation,
can still be deﬁned, but this has its own problems: bz is not deﬁned for any ﬁnite series

general cases of wave interference, such as isotropic random plane wave superpositions
[4], there is no overall propagation direction, and dislocation properties are determined
using derivatives of ψ on the dislocation. It is desirable to have a measure of screwness,
determining the twist of the local phase structure along the dislocation, in terms only
of local derivatives. The following is an exploration of this twist geometry.

2. The geometry of twist and twirl

The twist T w is deﬁned to be the rate of rotation of phase along a dislocation, according
to several diﬀerent measures to be described. The simplest geometric twist is the rotation
of a surface of constant phase along the dislocation, which is also the rate of rotation
of the normal to the phase surface. For convenience, a surface of constant phase in the

The phase structure transverse to the dislocation in (1.2) is isotropic, and all the
phase ribbons twist at the same rate. General dislocations are anisotropic, however, and
the local contours of intensity ρ2 are elliptical, with a corresponding squeezing of phase
χ. It can be shown [4, 5, 7] that (χφ)z=0 = R2ω/ρ2, where ω is the vorticity

To get a meaningful measure of the twist, it is therefore necessary to average T w(χ0)
over all phases, although it is not clear whether averaging with respect to the phase χ or
azimuth φ is appropriate. Both averages are possible, with the azimuth average proving
more analytically tractable ([5], equation (2.8.7))

It should be noted that although neither type of twirl is deﬁned when the ellipse is
circular, T well is, and for the example (1.2), it is
kz, as desired. It is also interesting
to note that T well is the sum of the numerators of T wφ and σ, divided by the sum of
the denominators.

For this example of a dislocation with a uniform twirl, and constant anisotropy,
the diﬀerent measures of twist are diﬀerent (although they are equal if c
0, as with
(1.2), or the twirl is zero, i.e. α = β; this was the case discussed in [5]). Of the diﬀerent
measures of twist, it would appear that T well is the most satisfactory: if β is a positive
integer multiple mα of α, the ellipse will undergo m
1 rotations as the phase undergoes
one, and the entire pattern is periodic (as in ﬁgure 1), with period 2π/α. T well is the
only measure of twist to reﬂect this. Equivalently, it can be argued that since the ﬁrst
summand in (2.9) deﬁnes the dislocation direction, it also deﬁnes the twist, and the
eﬀect of the second summand is merely to produce the twirl modulation.

3. Closed dislocation topology

When phase singularity lines form closed loops, certain topological identities must
be satisﬁed.
In relation to twist, continuity of the wavefunction requires that the
total number of twists of each phase ribbon must be a (positive or negative) integer,
which is the same for each ribbon. This screw number is therefore a property of the
dislocation loop, and is positive if the topological twisting is right handed with respect

to the dislocation direction, negative if left handed. For obvious geometric reasons, a
dislocation loop with nonzero screw number will be called a closed screw dislocation.

The importance of the screw number is that it gives the dislocation strength
threading the loop, by the twisted loop theorem: the screw number m of a strength
1 dislocation loop is equal to minus the dislocation strength threading the loop (in a
right handed sense). This result is discussed and proved in [5, 12, 17, 18, 19]. If the
dislocation loop is planar, then the integral of the ribbon twist around the loop divided
by 2π gives the screw number. If the loop is nonplanar, then the Cˇalugˇareanu-White-
Fuller theorem [17] implies that the writhe of the curve must be added to the twist
integral. Only planar curves will be considered here.

A simple wave containing a closed screw dislocation can be made from a

combination of polynomial waves in cylindrical coordinates [20]:

This wave has a closed screw dislocation in the z = 0 plane at R = R0, with screw
number m, its sense oriented opposite to φ. It is threaded by a strength m dislocation
up the z-axis.
If
m = 0, the loop is the familiar closed edge dislocation loop. T wφ, T well and σ are
m/R0 on the closed loop; the screw number is m. The twirl twφ is zero for this loop,

In [19, 20], high-strength loops with similar geometry were found.

and the anisotropy ellipse axes are oriented in the R, z directions.

The nature of the twisted phase ribbons near the dislocation have consequences for
the global topology of the total phase surface, that is, the wavefront. Figure 2 shows

a surface of constant phase (modulo π) of the wave ψclosed with m = 1. This surface is
a ‘noncompact torus’ (just as the plane is a ‘noncompact sphere’), extended to inﬁnity
because of the inﬁnite straight dislocation on the axis. Unlike a compact torus, there
is no way of distinguishing the two sides of the surface. The discussions in [5, 12] show
that such complex wavefronts are inevitable with closed screw dislocations.

The closed dislocation of (3.1) has zero twirl. Waves with closed twirling
dislocations loops can be made by superposing waves of the form ψclosed with dislocations
of opposite sense and diﬀerent topological twists:

When m1, m2 are diﬀerent, we may expect the twirl to be nonzero, as with (2.9).
Not every combination of m1, m2 yields the expected twirling wave however, because
the complicated threading interference structure is aﬀected in a nonlinear way. For
simplicity, k and R0 are taken as 1.

of T well may be explained by the fact that it is the derivative of the diﬀerence of angles
(2.8), the others are averages of an angle, and the average does not commute with the
integral around the dislocation loop. T well alone, of all the various twists considered,

and, by (3.3) and (2.8), twχ = 1 + twφ. The topological twirl around a closed loop is
also quantised, equal to the number of rotations of the anisotropy ellipse around the
loop, although it only needs to undergo a half turn to return to itself smoothly [2, 16].
Integrating twφ around the loop gives a topological twirl of
1/2 : with respect to
the anisotropy ellipse, the loop is a M¨obius band. The sense of topological twirl and
topological twist are independent.

−

Is there a twirl analogue to the twisted loop theorem? Indeed there is: ellipse
rotation around a loop is related to the anisotropy C line index enclosed by the loop.
ψ is zero;
Anisotropy C lines, where the anisotropy ellipse is circular, occur when
they correspond to phase singularities of this complex scalar, whose phase is twice the
rectifying phase χr. The anisotropy C line index therefore is half this phase singularity
strength. These observations, together with the twisted loop theorem, and the deﬁnition
(2.8) of T well, lead to the twirling loop theorem, which may be stated as follows.

· ∇

∇

ψ

The anisotropy C line index threading a closed dislocation loop (in units of 1/2)
is equal to minus the topological twirl minus the topological twist of the loop, i.e. the
number of rotations of the phase structure, minus the number rotations of the anisotropy
ellipse around the dislocation, in a right handed sense with respect to the dislocation
strength.

This gives a topological role to anisotropy C lines. Anisotropy L lines, where ω = 0
(that is, where all the phase surfaces share a common tangent), govern the reconnection
of dislocation lines [20].

4. Twist and twirl in isotropic random waves

As a ﬁnal example, twist and twirl are considered in 3-dimensional isotropic random
waves, that is, superpositions of plane waves with isotropic random directions and
phases, whose ellipse anisotropy statistics have been calculated [4, 5]. The details of the
calculations are omitted, but the methods follow exactly those of [4, 5], in which statistics
of many geometrical properties of dislocations were calculated. The calculations proceed
by taking advantage of the fact that ψ and its derivatives are gaussian distributed,
the details depending on the power spectrum of the waves considered. For all of the
probability density functions, the twists and twirls are in units of the characteristic
twist T wc = (k4/5k2)1/2, where kn is the nth moment of the power spectrum;
for
monochromatic waves of wavelength λ, this is 2π/√5λ.

support for the preference of T well.

5. Discussion

Twist and twirl for anisotropic 3-dimensional wave dislocations are not important for the
simplest optical vortices because they isotropic and therefore not subject to the subtleties
described here. However, it is important to note that the screw-edge distinction only
applies in special cases such as (1.2), and in more chaotic ﬁelds, only local phase
geometry may be appealed to. The three cases considered in sections 2, 3, 4 indicate,
for diﬀerent reasons, that the ellipse-deﬁned twist T well (2.8) is the best twist measure.

Local phase structure of wave dislocations

It is natural to ask whether there is any generic twist structure transverse to a
dislocation, related geometrically to the transverse component of the Burgers vector
(when deﬁned). It is reasonable to assume that such a quantity would be related to
the transverse curvature of the phase surface, since the twist is a curvature along the
dislocation. For the edge dislocation discussed above (whose transverse phase lines were
plotted in [1], ﬁgure 10), the Burgers vector is normal to the phase surface (mod π)
whose local transverse curvature is zero (a phase saddle in the transverse plane also
occurs on this surface). After some analysis, however, it is possible to show that the
phase contour whose local transverse curvature vanishes, is not unique: generically,
there are either one or three phases with this property, related to the number of real
roots of a certain cubic in tan φ; an example of a local form of a dislocation with this
property is

ψ = x + iy + i(x2

y2/2).

−

(5.1)

This direction, therefore, cannot be used to deﬁne the transverse component of a Burgers
vector locally.

The philosophy of studying phase singularities is that they give information about
the global phase structure: they are a 3-dimensional ‘skeleton’ for the entire ﬁeld. Twist
is an important property of phase singularities, and shows how this information may be
gleaned from the local dislocation morphology; closed screw dislocation loops indicate
nontrivial wavefront topology, as in ﬁgure 2. Phase anisotropy gives rise to further
structures, such as twirl, and anisotropy C and L lines. A possibility of a further
extension is analysing the gradient of the anisotropy scalar
its phase
singularities (the anisotropy C lines) themselves can be twisted, twirling, and therefore
related to even higher singular morphologies. The twirling loop theorem gives a ﬁrst
measure on how members of this hierarchy of anisotropy structures are coupled.

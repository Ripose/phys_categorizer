Abstract

In this work the interaction of electromagnetic ﬁeld with quasi-periodic media
has been scrutinized. We have obtained the formula for a distorted medium
polarizability tenzor in the X-ray frequency band. Also there have been ob-
tained the X-rays dynamic diﬀraction equations for the mediums with arbi-
trary smooth distortion. For these equations the Takagi-Tuipin equations are
obtained as a particular case. We have got a very simple formula for the
coeﬃcient of X-rays reﬂection on the bent Bragg mirror. We have scrutinized
the example of calculating the X-rays reﬂection and focusing by the bent
Bragg mirror. Also in this work one could ﬁnd the rezults of calculating the
reﬂected X-rays caustics form. It is shown that there exists a possibility of
7cm.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this article we consider interaction of electromagnetic ﬁeld with quasi-periodic me-
dia which we deﬁne as media obtained by some smooth deformation of perfect periodic
structures. Mathematically, the term ”smooth deformation” means the biunivocal smooth
mapping of the medium under consideration on the medium with perfect periodic structure.
The main goal of this article is to show that the electrodynamics of quasi-periodic media
can be reduced to the electrodynamics of the perfect periodic media, and, thus, to make
possible application to quasi-periodical structures of well-developed classical approaches.The
correspondence between perfect and quasi-periodical media is possible when the later one is
considered as the Riemannian manifold with the fundamental metric tensor gαβ = δαβ +2εαβ,
where δαβ is the Kronecker symbol and εαβ is the deformation tensor. To clarify this state-
ment, let us remind, that in the mechanics of continuous medium there are two methods
describing the deformation processes: the Euler method and the Lagrange method. The co-
ordinates coincide with the observer’s frame of reference in the Euler method. The method
of Lagrange stands that the co-ordinates are mounted into a medium and are deformed
together with a medium. It should be emphasized that the co-ordinates of some point of a

1

medium in the Lagrange co-ordinate system remain unchanged during the medium deforma-
tion, whereas the co-ordinates of some point of the medium in the Euler co-ordinate system
are being changed.
In particular, the co-ordinates of Bravais lattice points of a medium
with perfect periodic structure, deﬁned before the deformation by a set of three integers
n =
will remain constant both during the deformation and after the deforma-
tion. Hence, the Bravais lattice of a deformed (quasi-periodic) medium will look alike in
the Lagrange and the Euler co-ordinate systems. However, it is necessary to remember,
that the area engaged in a quasi-periodic medium in the Lagrange co-ordinate system is a
Riemannian manifold with the fundamental metric tensor varying from point to point.

Let us give some examples how the formalism developed in this article can be used
while describing the interaction of electromagnetic ﬁeld with media. Generally even perfect
crystals can be referred rather to the quasi-periodic media, than to the media with perfect
periodic structure because there are always temperature ﬁelds of deformation at least. The
classic and quantum superlattices electrodynamics of semiconductors also can be referred to
the electrodynamics of the quasi-periodic media when it is necessary to take into account the
ﬁelds of the deformation, permanently existing in such structures. A big amount of articles
devoted to the electrodynamics of the carbonic nanotubes is now published. In most cases
they take into the consideration the perfectly straight nanotubes with the perfect periodic
structure. Actually there are always some kinds of the nanotube deformation. It is possible
to reduce the electrodynamics of such nanotubes, and furthermore the electrodynamics
of ensemble of nanotubes in some matrix completely to the electrodynamics of the quasi-
periodic media. In real crystals the ensemble of the ﬂaws, dislocations and impurities creates
a ﬁeld of deformations, which is usually divided on two parts. The ﬁrst one is the averaging
over the ensemble and is the smooth ﬁeld of deformations. The second one describes the
ﬂuctuations of the deformations ﬁeld in comparison with this smooth averaged ﬁeld. The
interaction of an electromagnetic ﬁeld with the crystals, that have the deformation ﬁeld
being the averaged smooth ﬁeld of deformations, can be described by methods suggested in
this article.

The last example to be considered is the X-ray diﬀraction optics of the elastically de-
formed perfect crystals. Such crystals completely correspond to the deﬁnition of quasi-
periodic media given above. From the point of view of the classical electrodynamics, the
X-ray diﬀraction optics is a simple version of the geometrical optics. The only complication
are coupled waves inside a crystal which appear because of the dynamic diﬀraction. Despite
the distorted Bragg mirror is one of the most important parts of almost all X-ray optics
system, we have not seen papers correctly describing a dynamic X-rays diﬀraction on elasti-
cally deformed crystals with mean radius of curvature less or about 10m whereas elastically
deformed crystals with such media radiuses of curvature are of practical interest. Takagi-
Taupin equations1-2 and the series of articles (see bibliography), using this equations as the
basic ones are valid for elastically deformed crystals with mean radius of curvature more than
40m, as will be shown in part 4. Furthermore, these papers and also paper5, do not show the
diﬀerence between two methods describing the crystal deformation mentioned above (Euler
and Lagrange methods). The fact is also ignored that the deformed crystal in the Lagrange
co-ordinate system is the Riemannian manifold with a fundamental metric tensor varying
from point to point in the crystal. Such disregardings lead to a paradoxical statement, that it
is impossible to destinguish a perfect crystal and the deformed crystal in the experiments on

2

X-ray beam passing through a crystal far away from the Bragg condition. That contradicts
both daily practice of X-ray beams application and classical electrodynamics because the
deformed crystal is a nonuniform medium with refraction index and absorption coeﬃcient
depending on co-ordinates.

The ﬁrst section of this article is dedicated to the electrodynamics of media with perfect
periodic structure and is being auxiliary. As the medium with periodic structure is a medium
with a spatial dispersion and the relation between the vector of polarization and the electric
vector is not local, the wave equation is the integro-diﬀerential one and is rather diﬃcult
to work with. In case of media with perfect periodic structure one usually proceeds to the
(k, ω)-representation, where the integro-diﬀerential wave equation is replaced by the system
of the algebraic equations. Then one derives the medium eigenmodes from the dispersion
equation and gains all key results of the electrodynamics of media with perfect periodic
structure. Such an algorithm deﬁes the quasi-periodic media generalization, therefore in the
ﬁrst section we expound an unknown method, unwieldy and inconvenient on the ﬁrst sight,
that allows to substitute the integro-diﬀerential wave equation for the equivalent system of
the diﬀerential equations, that describes the electromagnetic ﬁeld dynamic diﬀraction by
the media with perfect periodic structure. This method can be naturally generalized for the
case of the quasi-periodic media.

The second section is devoted to the electrodynamics of quasi-periodic media. Proceeding
to the Lagrange co-ordinate system allows us to apply the formalism of media with perfect
periodic structure developed in the ﬁrst section to the quasi-periodic media almost without
changes in case we consider a quasi-periodic medium in a Lagrange co-ordinate system being
a Riemannian manifold.

In the third section we obtain the polarization tensor of a deformed crystal in the X-
ray frequency band from the ﬁrst principles by the joint solution of Maxwell equations and
von Neumann’s equation for a density matrix of a crystal.
It is necessary to underline
here, that the dependence of the Debye-Waller factor on the co-ordinates is ignored, the
Fourier-components of the polarization tensor of a deformed crystal coincide with Fourier-
components of the polarization tensor of a perfect crystal by the shape only in a Lagrange
co-ordinate system. These components appear to be very complicated co-ordinate functions
in the observer system (Euler co-ordinate system).

In the fourth section we obtain the equations system of the two-wave X-rays diﬀraction
on the deformed crystals and after a series of simplifying approximations we show that it
is possible to receive from these equations a combined Takagi -Taupin1-2 equations system
which appears applicable only for the deformations of the crystals with medial radius of
curvature more than 40m .

Finally in the ﬁfth section we use a principle of the geometrical optics locality to oﬀer a
simple formula for the Bragg reﬂection coeﬃcient from distorted Bragg mirror and describe
the X-ray quanta mirror focusing.

II. PERFECT PERIODIC STRUCTURES

First we consider interaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with a perfect periodic
medium. For media with spatial dispersion, the wave equation for electric ﬁeld vector in

where ˆχ(r, r′; ω) is the medium polarization tensor, and j(e)(r, ω) is the current density of
external sources. The intrinsic property of perfect periodic media to be translationally
invariant, makes it possible to expand the polarizability tensor into the Fourier series:

Let an electromagnetic wave be incident on a periodic medium with a given Bravais lat-
tice. If the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic ﬁeld is of the order of the elementary
sell linear extension, solution of Eq. (2.1) is reasonable to seek in the form of the expansion

Together with Eq. (2.3), this equation system describes the electromagnetic ﬁeld dynamic
diﬀraction by a perfect periodic medium.

When the wavelength is much larger then the medium unit cell linear size, electromag-
netic ﬁelds propagating in the medium can be averaged over the elementary sell and, then,
a hypotatic homogeneous medium with eﬀective constitutive parameters can be introduced
into consideration instead of the real inhomogeneous one. Polarization of this homogeneous
medium is related to averaged electromagnetic ﬁeld by Pavg(r, ω) = ˆχavgEavg(r, ω), where
ˆχavg is the polarization tensor which determines the linear electromagnetic response of the
In accordance with7, the eﬀective polarizability tensor

III. QUASI-PERIODIC STRUCTURES

The basic assumption which the procedure of derivation of Eqs.

(2.8)-( 2.10) leaned
upon, is the relation (2.3) accounting for the property of the polarizability tensor of per-
fect periodic structures to be translationally invariant. Under eﬀect of deformation, this
invariance, e.g. condition (2.3), is disrupted and thus the algorithm of Eqs.
(2.8)-(2.9)
derivation outlined above becomes invalid. However, an appropriate modiﬁcation based on
the approach originated from the continuous medium mechanics can be applied to involve
deformed periodic media into consideration. In the mechanics of continuous media there
are two alternative methods of the deformation process description, the Euler method and
the Lagrange method. In the framework of the ﬁrst one the co-ordinate system is coupled
with the viewpoint whereas the second method treats the co-ordinate system frozen into
the medium and, thus, in the process of deformation the co-ordinate lines are transformed
along with the medium. As a result, the Euler co-ordinates of a given point xi are changed
during the deformation whereas the Lagrange co-ordinates of it, ξi, remain ﬁxed. Lagrange
and Euler co-ordinates are related to one another by

xi = ξi + ui(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3);

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

(3.1)

|

ai|

where ui(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) stand for the deformation ﬁeld components. In particular, choosing the
co-ordinate system ei to be related to the elementary translation vectors of the Bravais lattice
ai, ei = ai/
, we ﬁnd out the Lagrange co-ordinates of the Bravais lattice sites to be given
by quantities ξn =
both before and after the deformation. Thus, one
can conclude that in the Lagrange co-ordinates, the Bravais lattice of a deformed periodic
structure looks like to the Bravais lattice of a perfect periodic structure and consequently,
the polarizability tensor in the Lagrange co-ordinates proves to be translationally invariant.
This allows us to state the relations as follows

(2πlj/aj)∂ξj/∂xi, i = 1, 2, 3 .. It should be emphasized that, mathematically, a deformed
medium is the Riemann manifold with the fundamental metric tensor as follows

gij(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = g0

Further mathematical analysis accounted for the properties of the Riemann manifolds al-
lows one to extend the approach being developed to media which need not be obtained
by deformation of the perfect periodic medium. In order for relation (3.1) to hold true, a
one-to-one smooth mapping (3.2) of the medium being considered into a perfect periodic
structure is necessary and suﬃcient to exist. The media for which such a mapping exists
we shall refer to as quasi-periodic media. Wave equation for quasi-periodic media in the
Lagrange co-ordinates takes the form as follows

The procedure of derivation of basic equation describing wave diﬀraction by quasi-
periodic media is analogous to that applied above under derivation of Eqs.
(2.8)-(2.9).
As in the case of perfect periodic media, solution of wave equation (3.4) we shell seek in the
form of expansion analogous to (2.3):

where kiare the wave vector k components in the Euler co-ordinate system. As before,
the wavelength λ = 2πc/ω is assumed to be of the order of the elementary cell linear size. It
should be emphasized that expression (3.5), as diﬀerent from Eq. (2.3), is not the expansion
in terms of plane waves because the phases Φl(k, ξ) = Φl(k, r) = (ki + τ (l)

(3.6) can be estimated in the following way. As has been pointed out
Integral in Eq.

(k; ω) is proportional to the amplitude of scattering of
electromagnetic ﬁeld by elementary cell. By this reason, the quantity ˆχl′
(k; ω) quickly fall
down with ξ′ and becomes negligible at distances exceeding linear size of the elementary
cell. It means that the Taylor expansion of ui(ξ

IV. THE POLARIZABILITY TENSOR OF ELASTICALLY DEFORMED
CRYSTALS IN THE X-RAY RANGE

In previous section we have obtained the basic equations of electrodynamics of quasi-
periodic media. Now, starting with the Maxwell equations and von Neumann equation for
the density matrix, we derive an explicit expression for the polarizability tensor in deformed
crystals, which constitute a signiﬁcant class of quasi-periodic media. Since the crystal unit
cell is about a few Angstroms in size, dynamical diﬀraction by crystals manifests itself in the
X-ray frequency range. Below we restrict consideration to this frequency range. As has been
shown above, a deformed crystal in the Lagrange co-ordinate system is similar to a perfect
crystal in the Euler system; consequently, the Lagrange co-ordinate system is preferable for
evaluation of the polarizability tensor of deformed crystals.

These approximations are proved to be correct for situation when the incident photon energy

condition allows us to restrict ourselves to the impulse approximation9 where there is
no diﬀerence between energy spectra of band electrons and electrons localized nearby the
nuclei: the electrons density periodicity in the crystal is of the only importance. That is
why, describing the interaction of X-ray quanta with the crystal, we use the terminology
appropriate rather to the isolated periodically arranged atoms devoid of zone structure then
to the crystal.
It should be noted that the above assumptions are not applicable to the
X-ray spectroscopy where both electron delocalization and peculiarities of the X-ray quanta
interaction with band electrons should be taken into consideration. However, this problem
is beyond the scope of this article and will be considered elsewhere.

The remarks made above allow us to present the crystal Hamiltonian ˆH0 by ˆH0 =
ˆHl + ˆHph, where ˆHph is the Hamiltonian of the phonon subsystem and ˆHl is the

For the atomic ground state in the crystal it is possible to neglect the inﬂuence on
this ground state of elementary crystal excitations (including inﬂuence of interaction with
phonons ) . In such a case, the crystal density matrix ˆρ0 can be presented by the product ˆρ0 =

excitations can not be neglected for excited atoms because they lead to the appearance of
the new decay channels of the exited state and, consequently, increase the Γ-width of the
exited state. Therefore, we will assume the Hamiltonians of ground and exited states to be
diﬀerent.

pα(n, l) =

tensor to be constant over the unit cell; then, gαβ(n, l) = δαβ + εαβ(n, l) ≈ gαβ(n) . This

It is easy
to verify that the proposed algorithm of accounting the inﬂuence of deformation on the
crystal phonon spectrum also suits the case of anharmonic oscillations of the crystal lattice.
At the end we will make two remarks. The ﬁrst: since the deformation tensor εαβ =
εαβ(ξ) is the essence of the smooth co-ordinates function, the equations (4.4)-(4.5) are local.
The discussed above method of accounting of deformation inﬂuence on the crystal phonon
spectrum is the approximation, that can be considered precise enough only when the length
of the phonon free path in the crystal is less then the linear dimensions of the area where
the deformation tensor variation can be observed. The second remark concerns the fact that
the introduced parametric method of accounting the deformation inﬂuence on the crystal
phonon spectrum is not something especially new in the solid-state physics: this method is
being the standard one in accounting the deformation inﬂuence on the energy spectrum of
band electrons (see for example10).

After the discussion made above let us continue the calculations of the current in the
deformed crystals that was induced by X-ray quanta. First let us take up the Rayleigh

In the frequency range where the X-ray quanta energy is greater then the binding energy
of any electron in the crystal, the current component describing the absorption of quanta by
the atoms and the consequent decay of the exited state which atom passed into by means
of quantum absorption is usually much smaller then the Rayleigh component (in the X-ray
optics it is called the dispersion correction). Nevertheless the accounting of this component
is very important as it determines the absorption of X-ray quanta in this crystal. Using the

(4.12)

Let us discuss the obtained expression. First of all let us note that in ( 4.12) the covector
k and the frequency ω are not bound together by any equation. As it is seen from (4.7),
(4.11) and (4.12), the crystal polarizability in the X-ray frequency range is a scalar value and
the relation between the current induced in the crystal by X-ray quanta and electric vector
or between polarization vector and electric vector is local only if we neglect the so-called
dispersion correction and, consequently, we neglect the crystal absorption of X-ray quanta.
If we want to account the absorption in the crystal, the statements like ”the polarization
vector in the X-ray frequency range is related to the electric vector by the equation P(r, ω) =
χ(r, ω)E(r, ω), where χ(r, ω) is the crystal polarizability, and is being a scalar periodic
function” are just incorrect. When we take into account the dispersion correction, we must
understand that the crystal polarizability in the X-ray frequency range is in principle the
tensor but not the scalar value and the relation between the polarization vector and the
electric vector is unlocal. That is why the procedure of derivation of the equations (2.8) and

18

(3.8) in parts 1 and 2 (they describe the dynamic diﬀraction of the electromagnetic ﬁelds on
the media with perfect periodic and quasi-periodic structures) accounts the nonlocality of
the response of the medium to the electromagnetic ﬁeld and is also true for the X-ray quanta
diﬀraction on the deformed crystals. The polarizability tensor of the medium is not being a
member of the equations (2.8) and (3.8) but his Fourier-components ˆχl(k, ω), that have the
ω2
relation between the wave covector k and the frequency ω already deﬁned: k2 = kiki =
c2 .
If to note that electromagnetic ﬁelds with wave covectors k and k + τ (l) interact eﬀectively
only in vicinity to the Bragg conditions k2 = k(l)2 = (ki + τ (l)
i )(ki + τ (l)i), one can easily
obtain the following formula for ˆχl(k, ω) from (4.12):

It is worth to note that for l = 0 the condition ϑ

then ˆχl=0(k, ω) is deﬁnitely a scalar value. For the wave covectors k and k + τ (l) (with

magnitudes in vicinity) near the Bragg condition the ϑ

where ∆θ is the angle width of the Bragg ”table”, i.e.

V. TWO-WAVE DYNAMIC DIFFRACTION ON THE ELASTICALLY
DEFORMED CRYSTAL.

In this part we will discuss the X-ray quanta diﬀraction on the elastically deformed crys-
tals. As the X-ray quanta ﬁeld in crystals can be considered as a transverse ﬁeld with high
accuracy, the dynamic diﬀraction on the deformed crystals in the two-wave approximation
according to the formulas (3.7), (3.8) and (4.13) is described by the following equations:
E(ξ, ω) = E0(ξ, ω)eiki(ξi+ui(ξ)) + El(ξ, ω)ei[ki+τ (l)

the absorption of X-ray quanta passing through the deformed crystal, the Takagi -Taupin
equations don’t correctly describe the real experimental situation (this distinction can be
neglected only for the crystal deformation with the average radius of curvature more then

If one notify that for energies 5KeV, 10KeV and 15KeV we have Re(χ(0)(ω)) =

−
that by accepting the simplifying assumptions in the equations (5.2) leading to the Takagi
-Taupin equations we reject the values that are 10 times greater than the values we keep
(for the crystals with the average radius of curvature less than 10m) while obtaining these
equations. This diﬀerence shown in Fig.4 becomes less then Re(χ(0)(ω)) for the deformations
with the curvature average radius more then 40m, i.e. very slightly deformed crystals. That
is why one should use exactly the equations system (5.2) for the theoretical analysis. This
system is a little bit more complicated but is suitable for the description of the X-ray optics
devices being met with in practice.

BEND BRAGG MIRROR.

The equations (5.2) ( equations for the slowly varying amplitudes of the ﬁeld of X-ray
quanta in the two-wave dynamic diﬀraction on the deformed crystals) for the arbitrary
deformation ﬁeld can be solved in general only numerically. In the article we underlined
more than once that the X-ray optics can be considered as the geometrical optics from
the point of view of general electrodynamics. That is why to obtain the coeﬃcient of Bragg
reﬂection from the distorted Bragg mirror we will use the geometrical optics locality principle
(see for ex.17) that evidently was ﬁrst time introduced in electrodynamics by V.A. Fock18
who investigated the reﬂection of the electromagnetic wave with smooth arbitrary shape
front on the smooth arbitrary shaped surface. According to the locality principle the wave
reﬂection in the every mirror point acts like if the incident wave is being smooth one and
the curvilinear surface in this point is replaced by the tangent plane. But it is necessary to
take into account that the incident and the reﬂection angle change their values from point
to point on this surface. Consequently the locality principle allows us to use the reﬂection
coeﬃcients obtained for the plane waves and plane surfaces, and in particular the Bragg
reﬂection coeﬃcient for the diﬀraction X-ray optics as the primary approximation. The

28

Bragg reﬂection coeﬃcient in the case of the plane wave reﬂecting from the parallel-sided
perfect crystal thick plate is determined by formula:

Let the X-ray quanta wave packet incident on the Bragg mirror with arbitrary smooth
deformation ﬁeld u(ξ) has the electric vector for quanta with frequency ω ( or the energy ε
) determined in the Lagrange co-ordinates system by the equation

where n(0)
are wave vector guiding cosines and E(0)(ξ, ω) and Ψ0(ξ, ε) are the slowly chang-
ing amplitude and phase of the X-ray quanta incident on the mirror. Then according to
the locality principle of geometrical optics this reﬂection coeﬃcient of the wave packet for
distorted Bragg mirror has the functional form like that for the plane wave and plane mirror.
But it is necessary to take into account that the values χ(0,
l), C, β and α for the distorted
Bragg mirror change from point to point on this mirror surface. If the dependence χ(0,
l)
on co-ordinates is determined by formula (4.13), the dependencies of C,β and α on the
co-ordinates can be deﬁned by the following ideas. The wave covector components of the

The fact, that the distorted Bragg mirror with rather big average radius of curvature can be
represented as a set of plane Bragg mirrors turned relatively to each other, is widely used
in X-ray optics systems designing. Nevertheless we haven’t found the formulas (6.3-6.4)
introducing this representation (or their analogues) in other papers. The linear dimensions
of the area participating in the forming of the diﬀracted ﬁeld in the point (ξ1, ξ2) on the
crystal surface are about the X-ray quanta crystal absorption length labs ∼ 10−
3cm.
If the deformation ﬁeld in this area can be considered as the constant value, the formulas
(6.3-6.4) are quite applicable.

The equations (6.3-6.4) and (6.5) solve the problem of X-ray quanta two-wave dynamic

Bragg mirror. The only problem remaining is the X-ray quanta propagation and focusing

As the example illustrating formulas (6.3)-(6.10) we will consider a simple situation when
the plane waves packet of X-ray quanta with parallel vectors and energies in the interval
from 11KeV to 17KeV incident on the plane-parallel silicon plate with thickness h = 0.1cm
and reﬂection vector τ (1, 1, 1) perpendicular to the plate entrance surface. We will consider
the crystal plate oriented in such the way that the Bragg condition precisely holds for the
X-ray quanta with energies 15KeV . Next this plate is distorted by momentums M1 and
M2 uniformly distributed over the plate sides in such a way that the deformations ﬁeld is
determined by the formulas (5.4) from the previous part and the distorted Bragg mirror is
the result of this deformation shown on Fig.1. Since by accepted condition the packet of
plane waves is incident on this mirror, one would let Ψ0(ξ, ε) = 0 in formulas (6.3)-(6.10)
in this situation. The angle between the diﬀraction plate and the co-ordinate plate (ξ1, ξ3)
will be denoted as ϕ. Fig.7-10 shows the graphs obtained with the help of formula (6.4)

for the module of coeﬃcient of Bragg reﬂection from this distorted mirror for X-ray quanta
energies 11KeV, 13KeV, 15KeV and 17KeV with ϕ = 0.

We remind that the caustics (the focal point multitude) of X-ray quanta diﬀracted on the
Bragg mirror is deﬁned exclusively by the X-ray radiation ﬁeld and does not depend on the
reﬂected quanta intensity distribution (Bragg radiation coeﬃcient) on the crystal surface.
By Fig.11-14 we give the caustics for X-ray quanta energies 11KeV , 13KeV , 15KeV and
17KeV obtained from formulas (6.9-6.10) for the whole Bragg mirror (without accounting
the intensity distribution of quanta reﬂected on the whole surface of the mirror, i.e. without
accounting the Bragg reﬂection coeﬃcient dependency on the co-ordinates of the point on
the mirror surface).

FIG. 14. Diﬀracted quanta caustic.

It is clear that in experiment there will be presented only the part of this caustic surface
which X-ray quanta are coming at, once reﬂected from the mirror area with the Bragg
reﬂection coeﬃcient suﬃciently diﬀering from null. These areas for our example are shown
on ﬁg.5. Fig.15-18 shows caustics (focal points manifold) obtained also with the help of
formulas ( 6.8-6.10) but taking into account the dependency of Bragg reﬂection coeﬃcients
on the co-ordinates.

It is worth mentioning that even in the simplest case we deal with rather compli-
cated (that is clear from these diagrams) combination of elementary diﬀerentiable peculiar-
ities (catastrophes) A1, A2, A3, A4 and D±4 (by V.I. Arnold classiﬁcation) of phase function
Φ(l)(ξ1, ξ2, ε) + S(r, ξ1, ξ2). That is why one can not even talk about the ﬁt (frequently met
in the X-ray optics articles, see for ex.21) of X-ray quanta intensity distribution near the
caustics (focus) with Gaussian function20 . The caustics intensity distribution is described
by special catastrophes functions the simplest of them being Airy functions and Piersey

38

integral22 investigated in details in articles23. If one models the intensity distribution by
Gaussian beams, it is necessary to use the special method of Gaussian beams summing
discussed in24.

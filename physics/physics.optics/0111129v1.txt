A simple and intuitive geometical method to analyze Fresnel formulas is presented. It applies to
transparent media and is valid for perpendicular and parallel polarizations. The approach gives a
graphical characterization particularly simple of the critical and Brewster angles. It also provides
an interpretation of the relation between the reﬂection coeﬃcients for both basic polarizations as a
symmetry in the plane.

I.

INTRODUCTION

bility of gaining insights into the qualitative behavior of
the Fresnel coeﬃcients, which is important in developing
a physical feeling of these relevant equations.

The reﬂection of a plane wave at a planar interface
between two homogeneous and isotropic media is a well-
known phenomenon. From a general perspective, that
embraces all kinds of waves, the physics of reﬂection is
well understood: mismatched impedances generate the
reﬂected and transmitted waves, while the application
of the proper boundary conditions at the discontinuity
provides the corresponding amplitude coeﬃcients1.

For light waves the impedance is proportional to
the refractive index. Therefore, the mismatching of
impedances gives Snell’s law, which, in fact, is indepen-
dent of the precise form of boundary conditions. On the
other hand, the continuity across the boundary of the
tangential components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
yields the reﬂection and transmission amplitudes, which
constitute the famous Fresnel formulas2,3,4.

In view of their simplicity and elegance,

it seems
diﬃcult to say anything new about Fresnel formulas.
However, a quick look at the index of, e.g., this jour-
nal5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, immediately reveals a steady
ﬂow of papers devoted to subtle aspects of this problem,
which shows that the topic is far richer than one might
naively expect.

Fresnel formulas provide complete optical information
about the interface. Although it is possible to fully exam-
ine their physical implications by a purely algebraic anal-
ysis, the discussion is usually carried out by using plots
of the coeﬃcients in terms of the angle of incidence. This
is mainly due to the belief that graphical results convey
information more readily than algebraic formulas. In this
spirit, it has also been proposed the use of geometrical
methods17,18,19 to analyze the problem. In our opinion,
these geometrical approaches are still worth exploring in
order to take full advantage of them. Thus, in this paper
we propose a new and extremely simple method that al-
lows one to construct Fresnel formulas by ruler and com-
pass. Geometrical construction by ruler and compass is
a fascinating problem since ancient times, and oﬀers the
additional advantage for the students of easily visualiz-
ing the steps of any construction and how it varies for
diﬀerent inputs.

We emphasize that these methods do not oﬀer any in-
herent advantage in terms of computational eﬃciency.
Apart from their beauty, their beneﬁt lies in the possi-

II. FRESNEL FORMULAS

Let two homogeneous isotropic semi-inﬁnite media, de-
scribed by complex refractive indices N0 and N1, be
separated by a plane boundary. We assume an inci-
dent monochromatic, linearly polarized plane wave from
medium 0, which makes an angle θ0 with the normal to
the interface and has amplitude Ei. The electric ﬁeld is
either in the plane of incidence (denoted by subscript k)
or perpendicular to the plane of incidence (subscript ⊥).
This wave splits into a reﬂected wave Er in medium 0,
and a transmitted wave Et in medium 1 that makes an
angle θ1 with the normal. The angles of incidence θ0 and
refraction θ1 are related by Snell’s law:

N0 sin θ0 = N1 sin θ1.

(1)

If media 0 and 1 are transparent (so that N0 and N1 are
real numbers) and no total reﬂection occurs, the angles θ0
and θ1 are also real and the above picture of how a plane
wave is reﬂected and refracted at the interface is simple.
However, when either one or both media is absorbing,
the angles θ0 and θ1 become, in general, complex and
the discussion continues to hold only formally, but the
physical picture of the ﬁelds becomes complicated20.

The wave vectors of all waves lie in the plane of inci-
dence and when the incident ﬁelds are ⊥- or k-polarized,
all plane waves excited by the incident ones have the
same polarization21. An arbitrarily polarized incident
wave can be resolved into its ⊥ and k components, and
each of them can be treated separately.

By demanding that the tangential components of E
and H should be continuous across the boundary2, and
assuming nonmagnetic media, the reﬂection and trans-
mission amplitudes are given by22

which are the Fresnel formulas. The physical contents of
these coeﬃcients are discussed in any optics textbook.

III. GRAPHICAL CONSTRUCTION FOR THE
REFLECTION COEFFICIENTS

A. General considerations

The geometrical method we outline here deals only
with the case when media 0 and 1 are transparent. The
refractive indices are then real numbers that we denote
by n0 and n1. Before going into details we wish to show
how the algebraic properties of the Fresnel reﬂection co-
eﬃcients can be intimately linked to some elementary
geometrical properties of an isosceles trapezoid.

The key point for our purposes is to note that the

reﬂection coeﬃcients can be written as

r =

a − b
a + b

,

(3)

where a and b are positive real numbers whose explicit
form depend on the polarization. To visualize the al-
gebraic properties of this quotient23 we propose to use
the geometrical construction depicted in Fig. 1. Let us
assume ﬁrst (Fig. 1.a) that a > b: then r > 0 and this co-
eﬃcient can be inferred from an isosceles trapezoid with
minor basis a−b and major basis a+b, since the quotient
of such bases is precisely r. When a = b (Fig. 1.b) the
trapezoid degenerates in an isosceles triangle and r = 0.
Finally, when a < b, the numerator in r is negative. Since
a segment cannot have a negative length, we represent
this case by plotting the bow tie of Fig. 1.c and we have
then that r < 0.

In the next section we shall illustrate how this simple
construction allows for a complete determination of the
reﬂection coeﬃcients. Before we do that and to relate
this interpretation with other previous results, we wish
to note that any equation of the form (3) can always be
expressed as

r =

a − b
a + b

=

ξ − 1/ξ
ξ + 1/ξ

= tanh ζ,

B. Perpendicular polarization

The previous general reasoning suggests that Fresnel
formulas can be seen from a purely geometrical view-
point. To go one step further, and to quantify these
ideas, we plot two concentric circumferences of radii n0
and n1 centered at the origin O, as shown in Fig. 2 (we
need to take care only of the ﬁrst quadrant). We assume
n0 < n1, which does not suppose any serious restriction.
For the case of polarization ⊥ that we are considering,
we draw in the circumference n0 the radius that forms an
angle θ0 with the horizontal. We denote by S0 the point
where this radius intersects the circumference. Next, we
draw a horizontal line from S0 that intersects the circum-
ference n1 at the point S1. The radius OS1 determines
then the refraction angle θ1. A quick look at this ﬁgure
shows that the projections on the vertical axis of the radii
OS0 and OS1 are identical, in agreement with Snell’s law.
If the light is incident from medium 1 at angle θ1 we
would obtain ﬁrst S1 and, in a completely analogous way,
the corresponding pair S0 and θ0.

When the point S0 runs the quadrant n0 (i.e., θ0 varies
from 0 to π/2) the point S1 runs the quadrant n1 in
such a way that θ1 varies from 0 to the critical angle θc
(obviously, total internal reﬂection occurs only when the
light is incident from the denser medium). This is a clear
way of picturing the critical angle.

On the other hand, the projections on the horizontal
axis of the radii OS0 and OS1 measure a = n0 cos θ0 and
b = n1 cos θ1, respectively. The values of a − b and a + b
have been marked in Fig. 3 as bold segments. Since a < b
for every θ0, r⊥ is always negative and the trapezoid is a
bow tie, according to our previous discussion. For θ0 = 0
the bow tie degenerates into two horizontal segments of
lengths n1 − n0 and n1 + n0, while for θ0 = π/2 it reduces
to two identical triangles.

As the angle of incidence increases, the minor basis
grows while the major basis decreases. Therefore, the
absolute value of r⊥ grows monotonically with the angle
of incidence, up to its maximum value of 1 at grazing
incidence.

Finally, the numerical value of r⊥ can be determined
by a ruler. To this end, it suﬃces with constructing the
right-angled triangle having as legs the bases of the pre-
vious bow tie. It is obvious that r⊥ coincides with the
height of a similar triangle of unity basis, as shown in
Fig. 3.

In spite of its simplicity, we think that this is a remark-
able formula24,25,26. It states that any reﬂection coeﬃ-
cient can be always expressed as a hyperbolic tangent,
just as in special relativity the velocities are expressed in
terms of the rapidity27,28,29.

The richer phenomenology of the k polarization is
clearly highlighted also by this graphical construction.
The method is essentially the same as that for ⊥ polar-
ization. Once we are given the incidence angle θ0, we
construct the refraction angle θ1 much in the same way.
It is clear from Eqs. (2a) and (2b) that rk can be ob-
tained from r⊥ by exchanging the refractive indices. In

consequence, this suggests, as shown in Fig. 4, that now
the radius OS0 must be extended until it intersects the
circumference n1 at the point P0. Similarly, we obtain
the point P1 as the intersection of the radius OS1 with
the circumference n0. Obviously, the horizontal projec-
tions of OP0 and OP1 are a = n1 cos θ0 and b = n0 cos θ1,
respectively and, as before, a − b and a + b have been
marked in Fig. 4 as bold segments. These segments are
the bases of an isosceles trapezoid that appears shaded
in the ﬁgure. The nonparallel sides have a length n0 and
form an angle θ1 with the major basis.

For θ0 = 0 the trapezoid degenerates into two horizon-
tal segments of lengths n1 − n0 and n1 + n0, as it happens
for ⊥ polarization. This reproduces the well-known fact
that at normal incidence there is no physical diﬀerence
between both basic polarizations, except for a sign.

As θ0 increases, the minor basis P1P ′

0 decreases, reach-
ing the value 0 (so rk = 0 also), which deﬁnes the Brew-
ster angle. In this particular angle (tan θB = n1/n0) the
points P0 and P1 are on the same vertical and, therefore,
the trapezoid becomes a triangle. We think that this
provides a remarkable way of visualizing this important
angle (see Fig. 5). When the angle of incidence is further
increased, rk becomes negative. This can be seen in the
fact that the trapezoid becomes a bow tie. Finally, at
grazing incidence this bow tie is made from two identical
isosceles triangles and then rk = −1, as for the ⊥ polar-
ization. The numerical value of rk can be determined by
a ruler by the same procedure as before.

Before ﬁnishing, we wish to emphasize that, concern-
ing the behavior of the corresponding transmission co-
eﬃcients, this geometrical construction still applies, but
its interpretation is more involved, because they do not
behave like a hyperbolic function28.

where we have written OS0 + OS1 = OS and OP0 +
OP1 = OP . It is easy to check that OS and OP have
the same length.

Next, we note that the four points considered until
now, namely, S0, S1 and P0, P1, are the vertex of the
sector of annulus shaded in Fig. 6. The triangles OP0P1
and OS0S1 are identical and can be obtained by a re-
ﬂection through the bisecting line OB of the sector. The
two diagonals S0S1 and P0P1 have the same length and
form between them an angle θ0 + θ1. On the other hand,
the bisecting line OB forms with the horizontal axis an
angle (θ0 + θ1)/2 and it is a symmetry axis with respect
to the pairs of points S0 and P1, P0 and S1, and P and
S. That is, OP and OS form the same angle α with OB,
where α can be computed to be

tan α =

(n1 − n0) sin[(θ0 − θ1)/2]
(n1 + n0) cos[(θ0 − θ1)/2]
n1 − n0
n1 + n0

tan[(θ0 − θ1)/2].

We thus conclude that the numerators in (7a) and (7b)

are related by

S1S0
{P1P0}

cos(θ0 + θ1)

,

while for the denominators it holds

{OP }
{OS}

=

cos[(θ0 + θ1)/2 + α]
cos[(θ0 + θ1)/2 − α]

= cos(θ0 − θ1).

(10)

This concludes the geometrical proof of Eq. (6) and shows
that the coeﬃcients r⊥ and rk can be interpreted as quo-
tients of horizontal projections of segments that are sym-
metric with respect to the bisecting line. As far as we
know, this simple result has been never noticed in the
literature.

It is the purpose of this section to show how our ap-

proach interprets the quotient3

as a simple symmetry in the plane. Azzam30,31 has no-
ticed that this relation can be recast so as to show a
universal character (i.e, it is independent of the two me-
dia that deﬁne the interface), and it has proven to be of
practical interest.

Let us denote by {AB} the horizontal projection of
the segment AB. From our previous discussion, we can
recast the reﬂection coeﬃcients as

The method given in this paper provides a geometrical
construction for getting the values of the Fresnel reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcients by ruler and compass. These graphical
methods appeal more readily to students than an analyt-
ical treatment.

The construction allows one to show at a simple glance
the variation of these coeﬃcients with the angle of inci-
dence and the peculiarities of the parallel polarization
when crossing the Brewster angle.

Localized Beampipe Heating due to e− Capture and Nuclear

Excitation in Heavy Ion Colliders

Abstract

At heavy ion colliders, two major sources of beam loss are expected to be

e+e− production, where the e− is bound to one of the nuclei, and photonuclear

excitation and decay via neutron emission. Both processes alter the ions

charged to mass ratio by well deﬁned amounts, creating beams of particles

with altered magnetic rigidity. These beams will deposit their energy in a

localized region of the accelerator, causing localized heating, The size of the

target region depends on the collider optics. For medium and heavy ions, at

design luminosity at the Large Hadron Collider, local heating may be more

than an order of magnitude higher than expected. This could cause magnet

quenches if the local cooling is inadequate. The altered-rigidity beams will

also produce localized radiation damage. The beams could also be extracted

and used for ﬁxed target experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ion colliders are expected to lose beam particles via ion-ion collisions. Besides purely

hadronic interactions, photonuclear interactions are of considerable interest [1] [2] and many

electromagnetic processes have cross sections larger than the hadronic cross section. Two

electromagnetic processes are expected to be major sources of beam particle loss: production

of e+e− pairs by the colliding electromagnetic ﬁelds, where the electron is produced bound

to one of the nuclei, and the excitation of one nucleus by the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the

other. In the latter case, the nucleus will be excited to a Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) or

higher state. Usually, the GDR decays by emitting one or more neutrons.

Both of these interactions alter the mass to charge ratio (rigidity) of the aﬀected ion.

For the heavy ions like gold or lead, the rigidity increases about 1% for electron capture,

and decreases about 0.5% for neutron loss. For lighter ions, the change is larger. Because

these changes are larger than the acceptance of the magnetic optics, these ions are lost from

the beam, and eventually strike the beam pipe. The hadronic showers from these collisions

will deposit their energy in the cryogenic magnets around the beampipe. Averaged over the

entire ring, the energy deposition is small. However, because of the well deﬁned rigidities,

the target area is a small fraction of the ring, and localized heating and radiation damage

may be a problem. The altered rigidity beams could also be extracted from the collider and

used as a test beam.

Here, we consider these reactions for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at

Brookhaven National Laboratory [3] and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) now under con-

struction at CERN [4]. Table I lists energies and luminosities for the systems considered

here. For the LHC, diﬀerent sources quote somewhat diﬀerent luminosities. This paper

will use the peak (initial) luminosities given in the RHIC conceptual design report and the

ALICE proposal for the LHC. The LHC luminosities are for 125 nsec bunch spacing and col-

lisions in 1 experimental hall [4]. If the bunch spacing is decreased to 25 nsec, the luminosity

increases by a factor of 5.

II. E+E− PRODUCTION AND E− CAPTURE

The electromagnetic ﬁelds of the colliding nuclei may interact and produce e+e− pairs.

The electron can be produced bound to one of the nuclei, reducing the net charge by 1;

usually the electron is captured by the K-shell.

The cross section for pair production and electron capture can be calculated using a

number of techniques. Although some coupled channel calculations have found very high

cross sections, new all-orders analytic calculations support the results of perturbative cal-

culations [5], despite the large coupling constant, Zα ∼ 0.6. For beams of identical nuclei,
the cross section for capture to a K-shell by a charge Z nucleus is [6] [2]

σ(A + A → Ae− + A + e+) =

33πZ 8α6r2

(1)

where α = e2/¯hc is the ﬁne structure constant, re the classical electron radius, γ the Lorentz

boost of a single beam, and δ ∼ 0.681. This is the cross section to excite a speciﬁc nucleus;
the cross section to excite either nucleus is twice as large.

The eﬀect of inclusion of higher shells is to boost this cross section by 20% [6]. With

this correction, the cross sections are given in Table I; the cross sections drop dramatically

as Z decreases; the energy dependence is moderate.

A recent extrapolation from lower energy data [7] found higher cross sections, 94 barns

for gold at RHIC and 204 barns for lead at the LHC, twice the perturbative result. If this

result is correct, then heating will be twice that predicted.

The particle loss rates, the products of these cross sections and the luminosity, are given

in Table II. The very strong Z dependence of the cross section is compensated by the

rapid luminosity increase as Z decreases, and the particle losses are largest for medium ions.

Table II also gives the single beam energy losses, which scales with the atomic number A.

Because the escaping positron has a very small momentum, the tiny nuclear momentum

change will not aﬀect the rigidity.

III. NUCLEAR EXCITATION

Many types of electromagnetic excitation are possible for nuclei. Single or multiple

photon absorption is possible, and the excited states can decay via single or multiple neutron

emission or by nuclear breakup. The most common is a Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR),

where the protons and neutrons oscillate collectively against each other. GDRs usually decay

by single neutron emission. Because of its large cross section, we focus on GDR excitation

and single neutron decay. Higher resonances typically have more complex decays, often

involving multiple neutrons.

The cross section for photonuclear excitation of a given nucleus is

σ(A + A → AGDR + A) = Z ∞

0

(2)

where k is the photon energy, dnγ/dk is the Weizs¨acker-Williams photon spectrum, subject

to the condition that the nuclei don’t interact hadronically [2] [8], and σGDR(k) is the GDR

excitation cross section. For heavy nuclei, the cross section peaks k = 31.2A−1/3 MeV +

20.6A−1/6 MeV [9]. For symmetric systems, the cross section can be parameterized [10]

σ(A + A → AGDR + A) = 3.42µb

(A − Z)Z 3

A2/3

ln (2γ 2 − 1).

(3)

Because this formula does not include other photoexcitation processes this cross section

is lower than some quoted elsewhere. For example, Ref. [4] gives a formula for GDR electro-

magnetic dissociation with a coeﬃcient about 20% higher than Eq. (3). The cross sections

from Eq. (3), listed in Table I, are less well determined than for electron capture, because

of competition with higher order processes, which can lead to multiple neutron emission.

For lower energy gold interactions, the cross section for 2-neutron emission is about 20% of

single neutron emission cross section [11]. Of course, this ratio could rise at higher energies.

For lighter nuclei, the higher order processes should be much less important. Since Eq. (3)

ﬁts existing low energy data fairly well, we use it here.

For heavy ions, these cross sections are comparable to those for electron capture. Table II

shows single beam loss rates for GDR excitation. For heavy ions, losses are comparable with

4

electron capture. Because GDR excitation is much less Z-dependent than electron capture,

it is the dominant process for lighter ions. Losses range up to 1.6 million particles/second

and 36 watts for calcium at the LHC.

Unlike electron capture, with neutron emission, the nuclear recoil is signiﬁcant. The

γ + A → (A − 1) + n reaction is a two-body problem; neglecting the small change in
binding energy, in the rest frame the nuclear recoil momentum is pexc. = √2mnk, where

mn is the nucleon mass. In the lab frame, the nuclear momentum change is a maximum of

∆/p = pexc./Amn, depending on the emission direction.

IV. TARGET REGION

Because the rigidity change is small, the aﬀected nuclei will strike the beampipe a consid-

erable distance down the beampipe, with the exact location depending on the beam optics.

Here, we consider a simple model, with the nuclei in circular orbits in a constant magnetic

ﬁeld. The radius of curvature is R = pA/ZecB, where pA is nuclear momentum and B the

magnetic ﬁeld. For an intact nucleus, R must match the accelerator radius R0.

Electron capture decreases Z by 1, so the radius of curvature increases to R = Z/(Z −
1)R0, a change of ∆R = R0/Z. The trajectory will gradually be displaced outward from

the beampipe centerline, with the displacement from the center growing as the square of the

distance travelled. If the nucleus travels an angle θ around the accelerator, the displacement

is x = 2∆Rθ2/π2. It will strike a beampipe with radius d after moving an angle qπd/2∆R,

a distance

Dc = θR0 = πs R0Zd

2

(4)

downstream from the interaction region. In the RHIC magnets, d = 3.45 cm [3] while for

LHC the horizontal magnet opening is d = 4.4 cm [12]. Values of Dc are listed in Table IV.

Neutron loss decreases the rigidity by a factor (A−1)/A, reducing the radius of curvature

to R = (A − 1)/AR0. With ∆R = R0/A, the nucleus will hit the beampipe a distance

5

Dd = πs R0Ad

2

(5)

downstream. Table IV gives values of Dd. Since A ∼ 2Z, Dd ∼ √2Dc.

Dc and Dd are the distances to the middle of the target regions; the length of the target

region depends on the spreading of the altered beam. Several factors contribute to the

spreading: the momentum spread of the incident beam, nuclear recoil (for GDR excitation),

and the size of the hadronic shower when the particle hits the beampipe. Focusing from the

beam optics will also have a big eﬀect; this factor is neglected here. We simply assume that

the optics remove the eﬀect of perpendicular momentum variations, leaving the longitudinal

momentum variations unaﬀected. We will add the rms momentum spreading for each of

these factors in quadrature, neglecting corrections due to the non-Gaussian nature of the

distributions.

RHIC is designed for a maximum momentum spread, ∆p/p = 1.5 × 10−3 [3] [13]. At the
LHC ∆p/p = 10−4 [14]. These ∆p/p are maximum variation; σp/p ≈ (1/√3) ∆p/p. These

numbers are typical; with time, intra-beam scattering and beam-beam interactions increase

the momentum spread.

The momentum spread also aﬀects the radius of curvature, with σR/R0 = σp/p. Ne-

glecting magnetic focusing, an intact beam particle with individual momentum variation δ

will hit the beampipe a distance

Dδ = πs Rd
2(|δ|/p)

(6)

downstream from the interaction region. Without magnetic focusing, particles with δ/p =

σp/p would strike the beampipe 118 meters and 12 km downstream at RHIC and LHC

respectively.

For GDR excitation, the recoil from the neutron emission aﬀects the ion momentum.

pexc. is the maximum momentum change; this can be approximated as a Gaussian with

σp/p ≈ 0.6pexc/pA. This σp/p is added in quadrature to the beam spread. It is usually the
dominant factor.

6

The interactions and momentum changes are combined by adding the σR, with

D± = πRs d

2σR±

(7)

where σR± are found by adding and subtracting the σR due to momentum spread from the

σR from the rigidity change. Energy is deposited over a length L = D+ − D−. Assuming
that the individual particle momenta follow a Gaussian distribution, 68% of the particles hit

within this target area. These L, given in Table IV, are small compared to D±. The small

L : D ratio is an indication that magnetic focusing will not drastically change the picture

presented here.

When the nucleus hits the beampipe, the size and shape of the hadronic shower depend

on the target geometry and magnetic ﬁeld. This will aﬀect how much of the energy is

deposited in the cryogenically cooled magnet. The magnet assembly can be approximated

as copper [15], which has a hadronic interaction length Λ = 15 cm. At 100 GeV/nucleon (3.5

TeV/nucleon), 99% (95%) of the energy is deposited within 10Λ [14], or 1.5 meters. Most

of this energy is deposited within a few Λ of the point of maximum shower development;

we treat the energy deposition as a Gaussian, with 2σ = 6Λ=0.9 meters. This 2σ is added

in quadrature with L to give the total target length. So, 68% of the total energy should be

deposited within this region.

Of course, some of the energy will escape down the beampipe or into the surrounding

environment. Here, we assume that half of the energy reaches the cold volume, with the

other half escaping. With these assumptions, the average power dissipations are given in

Table V. Even though the electron capture and GDR beams have similar power, the energy

deposition is more localized for electron capture because of the GDR nuclear recoil. Lead

and niobium are the most problematic, depositing 2.1 W/m and 3.0 W/m respectively.

These loads must be compared with the local cooling capacity. The RHIC Conceptual

Design Report does not specify a value for beam induced heating loads. However, at 4oK,

2.5 Watts of cooling is planned for a 9.7 meter long dipole [3]. The power dissipations are

far smaller than this.

7

At the LHC, the expected heat loads are much higher. The main sources, synchrotron

radiation and image currents are expected to deposit 0.6 W/m and 0.8 W/m on the beampipe

respectively. A screen will be installed inside the magnets to divert this heat from the 1.9oK

magnets [16]; less than 0.1 W/m is expected to leak through the screen. The accelerator

design also allows for 0.1 W/m from inelastic nuclear scattering which cannot be shielded

[12], for a total of 0.2 W/m. Because of the low luminosity, synchrotron radiation and image

currents are negligible for ion collisions, so the entire 0.2 W/m could be ’allocated’ to beam

losses. This 0.2 W/m is less than 10% of the 2.1 and 3.0 W/m expected from electron

capture for lead and niobium beams.

The local temperature rise from this energy will depend on the local cooling capacity and

thermal resistance. At 7 TeV, a loss of 8 × 106 protons/meter/second will induce a quench
[15]; this is about 8 watts/meter, uncomfortably close to the heat loads calculated above.

Since the altered-rigidity beams will remain in the horizontal plane of the accelerator, and

strike the outside (for electron capture) and inside (for GDR excitation) of the beampipe,

the heating will be uneven, and local hot spots are likely. These hot spots could induce a

quench even if the average power is below the quench limit.

V. DISCUSSION

At RHIC, the local heating due to altered-rigidity beams is within the available cooling

capacity. At the LHC, these altered rigidity beams have higher powers, up to 36 watts. At

the same time, the target regions are shorter than at RHIC, and the cooling capacities are

somewhat lower, because the LHC uses supercooled magnets. With niobium beams, the

expected heating is 3.0 W/m, 15 times the expected beam heat load of 0.2 W/m. For lead,

the ’standard’ ion choice, the heating is 2.1 W/m, 10 times the expected load.

These loads are close to the expected quench limit of 8 W/m. When the detailed dis-

tribution of energy deposition is considered, electron capture from either lead or niobium

beams might deposit enough energy to cause a magnet quench. With GDR, the heat loads

8

are lower, but may be problematic for niobium and calcium beams.

These estimates are based on back-of-the-envelope calculations; the uncertainties are

correspondingly large. The most important missing factors are the charged particle optics

and the magnet arrangement. The former could change the pattern of the energy deposition,

by decreasing or increasing the length of the target area, while the latter determines how

the energy aﬀects the magnet. Detailed simulations are needed to study both factors. At

the LHC, a calculation using the magnetic dispersion ﬁnds target regions with L = 1 m for

lead, 30% smaller than was found here [18].

However, for lead and niobium, it is not unlikely that supplementary cooling will be

required. Alternately, it might be possible to install new collimators to channel the energy

deposition. Current LHC plans call for a single collimator, located in one of the interaction

regions [19].

In higher-luminosity scenarios, the heating can be up to ﬁve times higher.

In these

scenarios, localized energy deposition could be the luminosity limiting factor.

The beams will also deposit signiﬁcant radiation in these regions. Although radiation

damage is beyond the scope of this article, current studies neglect this source [17].

Finally, it might be possible to extract these altered-rigidity beams and use them for

ﬁxed target experiments. Electron capture beams are the most appropriate for extraction,

because of the smaller emittance. The particle rates are comparable to those at existing

ﬁxed target heavy ion accelerators. At the LHC, the beam energies would exceed existing

ﬁxed target sources.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Both pair production with capture and nuclear excitation with neutron emission produce

beams of ions with altered magnetic rigidity. These beams will follow deﬁned trajectories

and strike the collider beampipe downstream of the interaction regions, producing localized

energy deposition.

9

At RHIC, this energy deposition is small, and should not cause problems. However, with

lead, niobium or calcium beams at the LHC, simple calculations indicate that the energy

deposition will be far larger than the planned cooling. Further studies are needed to conﬁrm

these simple models. If the local heating exceeds the available cooling, the magnets could

quench; electron capture could limit the luminosity achievable with heavy or medium ions.

In addition, these beams could cause localized radiation damage. These problems become

even worse for high luminosity running, with 25 nsec spacing between heavy ion bunches.

On the positive side, with appropriate optics, these beams could be extracted and used

for ﬁxed target experiments.

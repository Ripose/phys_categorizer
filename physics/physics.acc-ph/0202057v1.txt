Non-invasive single-bunch matching and emittance monitor

A. Jansson∗
CERN, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland
(Dated: February 21, 2014)

On-line monitoring of beam quality for high brightness beams is only possible using non-invasive
instruments. For matching measurements, very few such instruments are available. One candidate
is a quadrupole pick-up. Therefore, a new type of quadrupole pick-up has been developed for the 26
GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS) at CERN, and a measurement system consisting of two such pick-
ups is now installed in this accelerator. Using the information from these pick-ups, it is possible
to determine both injection matching and emittance in the horizontal and vertical planes, for each
bunch separately. This paper presents the measurement method and some of the results from the
ﬁrst year of use, as well as comparisons with other measurement methods.

I.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

A quadrupole pick-up is a non-invasive device that

measures the quadrupole moment

of the transverse beam distribution. Here, σx and σy are
the r.m.s. beam dimensions in the horizontal and vertical
directions, while ¯x and ¯y denote the beam position.

The practical use of quadrupole pick-ups was pioneered
at SLAC[1], where six such pick-ups, distributed along
the linac, were used. The emittance and Twiss parame-
ters of a passing bunch were obtained from the pick-up
measurements by solving a matrix equation, derived from
the known transfer matrices between pick-ups.

In rings, the use of quadrupole pick-ups has largely fo-
cused on the frequency content of the raw signal. Beam
width oscillations produce sidebands to the revolution
frequency harmonics in the quadrupole signal, at a dis-
tance of twice the betatron frequency, and this can be
used to detect injection mismatch. This was done at
the CERN Antiproton Accumulator, where the phase
and amplitude of the detected sidebands were also used
to ﬁnd a proper correction, using an empirical response
matrix[2]. However, this measurement was complicated
by the fact that the same sidebands can be produced
by position oscillations, which demanded that position
oscillations were kept very small.

In this paper, the idea behind the SLAC method is
applied and further developed for use in rings. The
quadrupole pick-ups used for the measurements pre-
sented here were specially developed for the CERN PS
and optimized to measure the quadrupole moment[3].
Two pick-ups have been installed in consecutive straight
sections of the machine[4]. The optical parameters at
their locations are given in Table I. As shown later,
it is crucial that the pick-ups be installed at locations
with diﬀerent ratios between horizontal and vertical beta
value. The phase advance between pick-ups is also an

important input parameter in the data analysis. In or-
der to minimize the dependence of this phase advance on
the programmed machine tunes and the beam intensity
(space charge detuning), the pick-ups were installed as
close as possible to each other.

The PS pick-ups provide both beam position and
quadrupole moment information, with bunch-by-bunch
resolution, over several hundred turns.
Since the
beam position is also measured, its contribution to the
quadrupole moment can be subtracted, leaving only the
beam-size related part, σ2
σ2
y. Throughout the rest
x −
of this paper, when referring to κ, it will be assumed
that this ‘artiﬁcial centering’ has been performed, unless
stated otherwise.

An example of a position-corrected measurement is
shown in Figure 1, where the usefulness of the correc-
tion is clear. The initial beam size oscillation due to
injection mismatch is clearly visible in the corrected sig-
nal. Note that beam-size oscillations are sensitive to
the direct space charge, which means that they have a
larger tune-spread, and therefore decohere much faster
than beam position oscillations. The diﬀerence in deco-
herence time between beam size and position oscillations
is therefore a rather direct measure of the incoherent tune
shift. The detuning of the quadrupole signal frequencies
can also be used to measure the incoherent tune shift,
as has been done in the Low Energy Antiproton Ring
(LEAR) at CERN[5].

is taken from a nearby wall-current monitor. These ana-
logue signals are sampled by digital oscilloscopes. The
digitized signals are then re-sampled[12] to correct for
the signal timing diﬀerences tΞ, t∆x, t∆x and tΣ. These
are mainly due to cable length diﬀerences, and have been
measured both with a synthetic signal and using the
beam.

The analysis of the data is made in a LabView pro-
gram.
In order to resolve single bunches, the data is
treated in the time domain, considering each bunch pas-
sage separately. The ﬁrst step in the analysis is to rid
the signal of its intensity dependence, by normalizing to
the measured beam current. The analysis is performed
in two diﬀerent ways, depending on whether the position
and quadrupole moment are expected to be constant or
varying along the bunch.

A. Position and size constant along bunch

If there is no variation in position and size along the
bunch, and one assumes that the quadrupole pick-up and

2

the wall current monitor have the same frequency re-
sponse, then the shape a given pulse must be exactly
the same in all signals (apart from a baseline oﬀset and
noise eﬀects). The normalization problem then consists
in determining the scaling factor between a pulse in the
beam current signal and the corresponding pulse on the
pick-up outputs.

To do this, time slices of about one RF period cen-
tered on the bunch are selected. Each selected slice is a
vector of N samples and, under the above assumption,
corresponding slices are proportional to each other. The
quadrupole moment can therefore be found as the least
squares solution to an overdetermined matrix equation,
which in the case of the quadrupole signal has the form

The constant c depends on the base line diﬀerence and
is not used. The same calculation is performed for the
position signals, and the position contribution to the
quadrupole moment is then subtracted.

An attractive feature of this method, apart from noise
suppression, is that the base line is automatically, and
unambiguously, corrected for. Diﬀerences in frequency
response of the two instruments could be corrected by
ﬁltering the signals, if these responses are known. How-
ever, such sophisticated corrections would enhance noise,
and are not necessary in the PS.

B. Position or size varying along bunch

Sometimes, there can be a variation in oscillation am-
plitude and phase along the bunch. At injection into the
PS, there are two main causes for this

•

•

The injection kicker pulse is not perfectly ﬂat,
which causes a variation of initial position along
the bunch. The result is a fast position oscillation
in those parts of the bunch that did not receive the
correct kick.

If the injected beam is longitudinally mismatched,
the mismatched bunch will rotate in the bucket
with the synchrotron frequency, causing the bunch
length to oscillate. When the bunch is tilted in
longitudinal phase space there is a correlation be-
tween energy and time, apparent as a variation of
the mean energy along the bunch. The degree of
correlation varies as the bunch rotates, and at a po-
sition with non-zero dispersion this gives rise to a
slow head-tail oscillation at twice the synchrotron
frequency. Both PS pick-ups are installed in dis-
persive regions, and are therefore sensitive to this
eﬀect.

•

There can also be a variation of the beam dimen-
sions along the bunch, as discussed toward the end
of this paper.

III. BEAM-BASED CALIBRATION

Internal signal consistency

In these cases, the basic assumption behind the algorithm
described in the previous section is no longer valid. In
fact, if the position varies along the bunch, any algorithm
that calculates the average position and quadrupole mo-
ment of the bunch will give an erroneous result. Since

< x2 >

=< x >2

(7)

one can not simply use the average bunch position in
Eq. (1) when correcting for the position. The correction
must be done point-by-point along the bunch. For this
purpose, a second normalization algorithm is used, which
ﬁrst establishes and subtracts the base line, and then
calculates the position

x(t) =

ZΣ
Z∆x

∆x(t)
Σ(t)

(8)

as well as the quadrupole moment in each point. After
this correction, an average beam quadrupole moment can
be calculated, but it is also possible to study variations
of the beam size along the bunch.

FIG. 2: Quadrupole moment (uncorrected) versus expected
beam position contribution. The squares and circles represent
measurements made with the same pick-up on two diﬀerent
beams. The slope of the line is the same in both cases, and is
very close to one (0.983).

One can take advantage of the position dependence
of the quadrupole moment to make a consistency check
between the position and quadrupole moment measure-
ment of the pick-up, using data with large beam position
oscillations but stable beam size. Since the beam size
oscillations damp away much faster than beam position
oscillations, such data can easily be obtained at injection
by an appropriate trigger delay. A plot of expected ver-
sus measured variation of the quadrupole moment with
beam position is shown in Figure 2, showing a good agree-
ment. This test can easily be automated, and is a good
indicator of whether the beam position correction works
well.

B. Comparison with wire-scanners

The standard method for emittance measurement on
a circulating beam in the PS is the fast wire-scanner. In
order to test the calibration of the pick-ups, measure-
ments were done on several diﬀerent stable beams, ap-
proximately 15 ms after injection. The quadrupole pick-
up signal was acquired over 200 machine turns, at the
same time as the wire traversed the beam. The compar-
ative measurement was performed on all the operational
beams available in the machine, with the exception of the
very high intensity beams that saturate the pick-up am-
pliﬁers. Thus there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in both
beam and machine parameters between the diﬀerent mea-
surements. This was done in an attempt to randomize
any systematic errors. The beam parameters are given
in Table II, where the diﬀerent beams have been tagged
with their operational names.

surements. Emittances and momentum spread are 2σ values.

EASTC 12 µm 3 µm 2.4 ×10

The r.m.s. variation in the measured quadrupole mo-
ments from turn to turn was of the order of 0.2-0.5 mm2,
depending on the beam intensity. Assuming that the
beam size was perfectly stable, this gives an estimate
of the single-turn resolution of the pick-up measure-
ment. Also the wire-scanner measurements were stable,
although for some beams there was a systematic disagree-

6
ment between the two wire-scanners measuring in the
same plane.

To compare the two instruments, the emittances mea-
sured with the wire-scanners were used to calculate the
expected quadrupole moment at the locations of the
pick-ups. The momentum spread required for both the
wire scanner measurement and the subsequent calcula-
tion was obtained by a tomographic analysis of the bunch
shape[6]. The propagated systematic error was estimated
on the assumption that the wire-scanner accuracy is 5%
in emittance, the beta function at the pick-ups is known
to 5%, the dispersion to 10% and the momentum spread
to 3% accuracy. These estimates are rather optimistic,
but give considerable propagated errors for certain mea-
surement points. For simplicity, possible correlations be-
tween errors (e.g. beta function errors at diﬀerent lo-
cations in the machine) were ignored, and all diﬀerent
error sources were added in quadrature. To accentuate
the cases with wire-scanner disagreement, each of the
four diﬀerent ways of combining the two horizontal and
two vertical wire-scanners was calculated separately and
displayed as separate points. The result is shown in Fig-
ure 3.

Overall, the measured data seem to indicate that the
oﬀsets are slightly smaller than measured in the lab,
which could be explained by the fact that the pick-ups
were dismantled in the lab to be moved to the machine.
However, the eﬀect is within the error-bar, and no strong
conclusion can therefore be made. Moreover, the pick-
ups have been dismantled and rebuilt in the lab, without
eﬀect on the measured oﬀsets.

The point corresponding to the EASTC beam appears
to disagree somewhat in both planes, although the eﬀect
is just about within the error-bar. There are a number
of possible explanations for this:

•

The PS is operated in a time-sharing mode, where
a so-called super-cycle containing a certain num-
ber (usually 12) of beam cycles is repeated over
and over again. At the time of the measurement,
the super-cycle contained several instances of the
EASTC beam, and it is known from experience
that the position within the super-cycle can aﬀect
the beam characteristics. For this particular mea-
surement, it is not guaranteed that the measure-
ments with the two instruments were done on the
same instance of the beam, whereas for all other
measurements there was either only one instance
of the beam in the super-cycle, or the acquisition
was locked to a certain instance. Some ﬂuctuations
of the measured value were also observed.

•

The EASTC beam has a large momentum spread
and a horizontal tune close to an integer resonance.
Theory indicates that the correction quadrupoles
used to obtain this working point can perturb the
dispersion function by more than 15%[7], which
would aﬀect both the accuracy of the wire-scanner
measurement, and the subsequent calculation of the

4

expected quadrupole moment. Studies of this eﬀect
are planned for the 2002 run.

The general conclusion from the measurement series
is that the wire-scanner and quadrupole pick-up agree
within the error bar. The systematic errors due to optics
parameters make it impossible to detect with certainty
any diﬀerence in pick-up behavior between the laboratory
measurements with a simulated beam, and the measure-
ments on real beam in the machine.
In order to cali-
brate the pick-ups accurately using the beam, the wire-
scanners and the pick-up should be situated in the same
straight section, which is excluded in the PS due to space
limitations.

C. Comparison with turn-by-turn proﬁle
measurement

Comparative measurements of injection matching have
been done using a SEM grid with a fast acquisition
system[8], that can measure beam proﬁles turn-by-turn
for a single bunch. This is a destructive device and can
only be used in rare dedicated machine development ses-
sions. It is also limited both in bandwidth and maximum
beam intensity, and therefore it has not been possible
to make a full systematic study on beams with diﬀerent
characteristics.
Instead, a special beam was prepared,
with low intensity to spare the grid, and long bunches
due to the bandwidth limitations.

The SEM grid data was used to calculate the expected
value of the quadrupole moment at the pick-up locations,
using the beta values, dispersion, and relative phase ad-
vance in Table I. The results are shown in Figure 4, and
show a rather good agreement with what was actually
measured with the pick-ups. The small diﬀerences can
be accounted for by systematic error sources, i.e.
the
optical parameters used in the comparison.

IV. EMITTANCE MEASUREMENT

When the circulating beam is stable, the quadrupole
moments of a given bunch, as measured by the two pick-
ups, are constant and given by

κ1 = ǫx ¯βx 1 −
κ2 = ǫx ¯βx 2 −

equations can be solved for the emittances if

ment on the beta functions at the pick-up locations. If
the ratio between horizontal and vertical beta function is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at the two locations, the equations

that the cases where the two wire-scanner results are inconsistent also are cases with large estimated systematic error.

passages. The dominant errors are therefore systematic,
coming from oﬀsets in the pick-ups and errors in the beta
functions, lattice dispersion and momentum spread. The
pick-up oﬀsets are, however, known from test bench mea-
surements. Furthermore, by comparing the amplitude of
position oscillations as measured by the two pick-ups, the
ratios βx1/βx2 and βy 1/βy2 can be determined.

The main uncertainty is thus the absolute value of the
beta function, as for almost any other emittance mea-
surement (e.g. wire-scanner). The accuracy can therefore
be expected to be comparable to that of a wire-scanner.
An emittance measurement using the pick-up system is
shown in Figure 5, and compares well with wire-scanner
results.

Note that with three pick-ups, suitably located, the

momentum spread could also be measured.

V. MATCHING MEASUREMENT

Even though quadrupole pick-ups can be used to mea-
sure ﬁlamented emittance, the main reason for installing
such instruments in the machine is to be able to mea-
sure betatron and dispersion matching at injection, as no
other instrument (apart from the destructive SEM-grid)
is able to do this. One would like not only to detect mis-
match, but also to quantify the injection error in order
to be able to correct it.

a stable circulating beam with quadrupole pick-ups is in
fact rather straightforward.

Statistical errors due to random ﬂuctuations in the

be reduced by averaging over many consecutive beam

A. Matrix inversion method

To determine the parameters of the injected beam, the
SLAC method[1] based on matrix inversion could be di-
rectly applied, since the quadrupole moment is measured
on a single-pass basis. An advantage when performing
this measurement in a ring, as compared to measuring in
a linac, is that each pick-up can be used several times on
the same bunch. Therefore it is enough to use two pick-
ups instead of six, which reduces both the hardware cost
and the systematic error sources. It is also straightfor-
ward to improve on statistics by increasing the number of
measured turns, thereby reducing noise. Another advan-
tage in a ring is that the periodic boundary conditions
reduce the number of parameters needed to calculate the
matrix. Many of these parameters (tunes, phase advance
between pick-ups, ratios between beta function values)
can also be easily measured, which means that the ma-
trix can be experimentally veriﬁed.

However, the matrix method was developed for a linac,
and does not take full advantage of the properties of a
ring. Also, it does not include dispersion eﬀects, and it
is necessary to make assumptions on the space charge
detuning when calculating the matrix.

B. Parametric ﬁt method

In a ring, the turn by turn evolution of the beam enve-
lope, and therefore the quadrupole moment, can be ex-
pressed in a rather simple analytical formula. Expanded
in terms of the optical parameters, the quadrupole mo-
ment of a beam is given by

If the beam is initially mismatched in terms of Twiss

Here, barred parameters refer to properties of the lattice,
and νx,y = 2πqx,y. The ﬁrst line contains constant terms,
and also gives the steady state value that will be reached
when the oscillating components have damped away.

The two middle lines of Eq. (12) are signal components
at twice the horizontal and vertical betatron frequencies.
They arise from both dispersion and betatron mismatch.
The betatron mismatch is parametrized by

(13)

where, again, the last approximation is valid for small
mismatch. The fourth line of Eq. (12) is a signal at the
horizontal betatron frequency, which is due to dispersion
matching. This mismatch is parametrized by the vector

~δDx =



¯βx∆D′

∆Dx
√ ¯βx
x + ¯αx



p

∆Dx





(14)

There is no corresponding signal at the vertical betatron
frequency due to the absence of vertical lattice disper-
sion. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish vertical
dispersion mismatch from vertical betatron mismatch by
studying the quadrupole signal. However, one does not
usually expect a large vertical dispersion mismatch.

The steady state (ﬁlamented) emittance is given by

where the last approximation is valid for small betatron

By ﬁtting the above function to the data, the injected
emittances, the betatron mismatches in both planes, and
the horizontal dispersion mismatch are directly obtained.
The tunes can also be free parameters in the ﬁt, which
automatically estimates and corrects for space charge de-
tuning. An example of a ﬁt to measured data is shown
in Figure 6. A requirement for a good ﬁt convergence is,

as when measuring ﬁlamented emittance, that the ratio
between beta functions should be diﬀerent at the pick-
up locations. Also, the tunes must be such that enough
independent data points are obtained. In other words, if
the quadrupole signal is repetitive, it must have a period
larger than the minimum number of turns required for
In the PS, this means that the working point
the ﬁt.
Qh = Qv = 6.25, which is close to the bare tune, should
be avoided. The ﬁt result is also less stable in the vicinity
of this working point, and when the tune in only one of
the planes is close to 6.25. With two pick-ups, at least
ﬁve machine turns (10 data points) are required for the
ﬁt, if the tunes are also free parameters. Some more turns
can be used to check the error, but the maximum number
of turns is limited by decoherence, as discussed below.

Note that since the beam size oscillations due to dis-
persion mismatch are also detuned by space charge, mea-
suring the dispersion component separately (by changing
the energy of the beam and measuring the coherent re-
sponse) would result in an accumulated phase error in
the dispersion term.

a relatively good match also for the subsequent turns. The

were quite signiﬁcant, ∆Qh = 0.01 and ∆Qv = 0.05 (as com-

for three diﬀerent momentum (tune) distributions. Here, ∆Q
is the r.m.s. tune spread and n is the number of revolutions.

In reality, the tune of each individual particle is chang-
ing with time (e.g. due to synchrotron motion), and
therefore the decoherence pattern is more complicated.
However, synchrotron motion is negligible for the ﬁrst
few turns. Therefore, data analysis is greatly simpliﬁed
and accuracy is improved, if one limits the number of
turns to a rather small value. This also demonstrates an
advantage of the ﬁt method over an FFT analysis of the
signals, since an FFT needs many points to achieve good
frequency resolution.

The ﬁt function above does not include the eﬀect of
decoherence (damping) of the beam width oscillations.
Fortunately, due to the physics of the decoherence pro-
cess, the decay of the oscillation amplitudes is not expo-
nential as for many other damping phenomena.

To test the injection matching measurement, a series
of measurements was done with diﬀerent settings of some
focusing elements of the PS injection line. An example
of such a measurement is shown in Figure 8, where a
quadrupole was changed in steps of 10 A, and the result-
ing variation of the ﬁt parameters recorded. The varia-

Injected emittance, betatron and dispersion mismatch vectors for three diﬀerent settings of a transfer line quadrupole.
Note the large dispersion mismatch. The vectors illustrate the variation in mismatch that is expected for a correction of -10A
(calculated from beam optics theory). There is a good agreement between expected and measured behavior, indicating that
the measurement works well.

tion of the diﬀerent error vectors expected from beam op-
tics theory is also shown, and there is a rather good agree-
ment, both in direction and magnitude of the changes.
The injected emittances are unchanged, as expected.

since the dominant error (the dispersion mismatch) can
not be corrected without a complete change of optics of
the entire line. Studies for a new dispersion matched
optics are underway.

By using the theoretical response matrix for dispersion
and betatron matching, a proper correction to the mea-
sured error can be calculated[11]. So far, actual correc-
tions of the measured mismatches have not been made,

While the dispersion mismatch is large for all beams,
due to the transfer line design, the level of betatron mis-
match varies between diﬀerent operational beams. Most
high intensity beams measured were observed to be fairly

well matched, whereas some lower intensity beams had
a signiﬁcant mismatch. This might be explained by the
fact that mismatch is likely to cause losses for aperture
limited beams, and therefore the process of intensity opti-
mization leads to well-matched beams, although the mis-
match is never directly measured. This indirect matching
mechanism is absent for the future bright LHC beam, and
it can therefore be expected to develop a relatively large
mismatch if not continuously monitored and corrected.

VI. MEASUREMENT WITHIN THE BUNCH

As mentioned earlier, the transverse mean position can
sometimes vary along the bunch. However, in some cases,
also the beam size itself varies along the bunch. This
is notably the case for high intensity beams that are
highly non-Gaussian. For a Gaussian beam distribution,
the transverse bunch width is constant along the bunch.
This is because the multi-dimensional Gaussian is just
a product of one-dimensional Gaussians. However, for a
parabolic beam this is no longer true, as may be easily
veriﬁed analytically. With the pick-ups, it is possible to
measure the quadrupole moment as a function of position
within the bunch. The measurement is good over most
of the bunch, but naturally gets very noisy and prone
to systematic errors in the head and tail, since these re-
gions are sparsely populated. A measurement made on
a stable beam is shown in Fig. 9. The plot also shows
the same measurement with the dispersion contribution
subtracted[14], indicating that the variation of beam size
along the bunch is mainly due to variations in momen-
tum spread. This ﬁts with the fact that the longitudinal
bunch distribution is usually non-Gaussian. Applying
the methods discussed earlier on the dispersion corrected

data, it is also possible to calculate the emittance varia-
tions along the bunch.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The quadrupole pick-ups recently built and installed
in the PS machine have been evaluated in a series of
measurements. These pick-ups measure both injection
matching and emittance for a single, selected bunch in
the machine. The measurement can be made parasiti-
cally, without perturbing the beam, because the devices
are non-intercepting.

Comparison with other instruments in the machine
show good agreement. All observed deviations are within
the estimated systematic error bars. The systematic er-
rors come mainly from the imperfect knowledge of beta
value and dispersion needed to evaluate the data. Sys-
tematic errors are indeed expected to dominate the total
error in the quadrupole pick-up measurement, as is the
case for most emittance measurement devices.

For matching applications, the pick-ups can be used to
determine phase and amplitude of horizontal and vertical
betatron mismatch, as well as horizontal dispersion mis-
match. This analysis can be done individually on each
injected bunch. Since the mismatch is detected as an
oscillation, the eﬀect of systematic errors (e.g. pick-up
oﬀsets) is not very important.

As emittance measurement devices, the pick-ups have
some interesting properties. The single turn resolution
makes it possible to measure and follow the evolution of
the emittance over many turns (limited only by acquisi-
tion memory). When measuring ﬁlamented emittance, it
possible to reduce the eﬀect of noise by averaging over
many turns, and also to check that the beam is stable
during the measurement, something that is assumed but
not actually veriﬁed during a wire scanner measurement.
More important, the pick-ups have no moving parts that
wear out, as is the case for a wire-scanner. This makes it
possible to create a watchdog application to monitor the
evolution of the emittances pulse by pulse over a long pe-
riod. In such an application, systematic errors are again
of lesser importance, since variations rather than abso-
lute values are sought.

The pick-ups can also be used to study variations of the
emittance along the bunch, although this may be mainly
of academic interest.

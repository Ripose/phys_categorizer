Abstrat

In the usual parameter regime of aelerator physis, partile en-

sembles an be treated as lassial.

If we approah a regime where

ǫxǫyǫs ≈

Nparticlesλ3

Compton , however, the granular struture of quantum-

mehanial phase spae beomes a onern. In partiular, we have to

onsider the Pauli exlusion priniple, whih will limit the minimum

ahievable emittane for a beam of fermions. We alulate these low-

est emittanes for the ases of bunhed and oasting beams at zero

temperature and their (cid:28)rst-order hange rate at (cid:28)nite temperature.

1 Dynamis

Consider an ultra-relativisti partile beam in a irular aelerator. Neglet-

ing higher-order e(cid:27)ets, the Hamiltonian an be written as a quadrati form

in the usual phase-spae oördinates x, x′, y, y′, σ, δ .

However, this Hamiltonian is not appropriate for quantization, as energy

and time have swithed roles. Thus, we use the Hamiltonian of the system in

the beam's frame of referene, whih an be obtained by a series of anonial

(in the ase of magneti quadrupoles, one has κx =
external eletri potential. The diretions x, y, z are radial, transversal, and
tangential, respetively. Note that we use units with ~ = c = kB = m0

−

throughout, so all quantities are expressed in powers of the Compton length

of the partiles onsidered.

The longitudinal part of the Hamiltonian depends on the physial setup.

The partiles might either be on(cid:28)ned by the nearly harmoni potential of

the RF buket, or we have ase of a oasting beam, where the only onstraints

imposed on the longitudinal motion are the ones due to the periodiity of

the problem. In the sequel, we will onsider both ases.

2 Anisotropi Osillator

Let us assume that the longitudinal motion is determined by the presene of

an RF buket. We an approximate the potential Φ by expanding it to 2nd
order in z . For reasons of simpliity, we only take into aount the O(z2)

term, i. e., we assume that the partile is on the orbit and is not losing energy.

We an obtain the sti(cid:27)ness of the longitudinal osillator in the loal anon-

ial oördinates by Lorentz-boosting the (t, z) omponents of the momentum

vetor:

The (cid:28)rst ondition will always be ful(cid:28)lled for realisti mahines. The

seond one orresponds to the mahine being below or above transition: if

the seond fator hanges sign, the eigenfrequeny an be mad real again by

(cid:29)ipping the sign of ω2

Φ′′RF . However, the absolute sign of both the kineti

z ∝

and the potential term will hange, leading to the (for purposes of onstrut-

ing the quantum-mehanial ground state) pathologial ase of a hamiltonian

not limited from below. In the sequel, we will assume the mahine is below

transition.

Thus, expanding (1) to (cid:28)rst non-trivial order in the anonial oördi-

nates and applying the anonial transformation removing the mixed term

in (3), we obtain the Hamiltonian of a 3-dimensional harmoni osillator with

orreted frequenies given by (5); the ground state is haraterized by the

oupation numbers nd

sake of generality, we onsider the ase of d dimensions. The ground state for

Finally, the emittane is given in terms of the averaged single-partile

Thus, the pro jeted emittanes sale as N

Furthermore, due to the ourrene of the geometri mean of the frequen-

ies in (10), the pro jeted emittane in one dimension an be lowered by

shallowing the potential in the other dimensions.

Note that a similar approah has been hosen elsewhere; [[2℄℄ gives an

estimate for ǫmin from a similar reasoning, but ends up (due to a misounting

of the states) with a saling di(cid:27)erent from our result.

3 Mixed Case: Longitudinally Free Partiles

So far, we have assumed an anisotropi osillator. But given the ase of a

partile moving freely longitudinally, the energy ontent of that degree of

4

freedom will be given by the square of the (angular) momentum. (We might

onsider the boundary onditions imposed by a periodi box instead of a

irular arrangement.) We treat the general ase, i. e. a Hamiltonian

4 The ground state as a Fermi liquid

In our onstrution, we taitly assume that the partile-partile interation

does not modify the partile ontent of the ground state. This orresponds

preisely to the notion of a Fermi liquid (in our ase, a highly anisotropi

one), in whih the free partile spetrum smoothly deforms into the quasi-

partile spetrum of equal partile ontent when the interation is swithed

on adiabatially. This naïve assumption of the existene of a Fermi surfae

may break down if we take into aount partile-partile interations. The

behavior of an ultra-old bunh above transition would be of speial interest

here, sine it exhibits a negative-mass behavior in the longitudinal degree of

freedom.

For the ase of the system being below transition, we an make the fol-

lowing semi-quantitative argument for the existene of a Fermi liquid: The

partile beam will have an average radial dimension given by the exursion

of a partile on the Fermi edge in the radial or transverse osillator potential:

The above onsiderations were for the ase of zero temperature. To generalize

to (cid:28)nite temperatures, we follow the usual presription and introdue a hem-

ial potential. Let's treat the all-osillator ase (cid:28)rst; the quantity we want

to alulate is the logarithm of the partition funtion of the grand-anonial

6 Limitations and Prospets

So far, we have onsidered two limiting ases of a irular setup: An in(cid:28)nitely

extending harmoni potential and a free partile sub jet to periodi boundary

onditions. While this is a realisti approah for the transverse degrees of

freedom, the longitudinal dynamis is more omplex.

In the ase of high

longitudinal densities, two fators limit our model:

1. The longitudinal buket is anharmoni and limited from above. While

the former fat is probably benign, the latter poses the question of how

the inreasing spetral density at the upper boundary of the buket

9

a(cid:27)ets transversal emittane in the ase of an almost full RF buket;

this has to be further investigated. An appropriate approah would be

to treat the periodi hain of RF buket as a periodi potential, so the

longitudinal eigenfuntion would be Bloh funtions.

2. The partile-partile interation a(cid:27)ets the sti(cid:27)ness of the transverse

osillators.

In the limiting ase of zero temperature and su(cid:30)iently

strong fousing fores in a smooth lattie, the ground state is believed

to be a rystalline state. The most simple realization of a rystalline

state would be a one-dimensional eletron hain, whih is known as a

1-D Wigner rystal[4℄ in the ontext of solid state physis (in a Wigner

rystal, the neutralizing (cid:28)eld is provided by the ions of the rystal

lattie, whih are (cid:16)smeared out(cid:17) homogeneously to form the (cid:16)jellium(cid:17),

whereas in our ase stability is ahieved by external fousing elements).

This ase is highly degenerate: we expet the eletrons to be in well-

loalized states with equal potential energy, the only quantum e(cid:27)et

being the phononi osillation of the eletron lattie[5, 6, 7℄; onse-

quently, the transverse emittane an be at its quantum-mehanial

minimum of 1 Compton wavelength. Modeling the rossover behavior

from free-partile eigenstates as in this paper to loalized states and the

transition from (cid:28)nite to zero emittane requires further investigation.

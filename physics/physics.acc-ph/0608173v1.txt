Abstract

We investigate the transverse beam dynamics in the thermal wave model by using
a functional method.
It can describe the beam optical elements separately with
a kernel for a component. The method can be applied to the general quadrupole
magnets beyond a thin lens approximation as well as drift spaces. We found that the
model can successfully describe the PARMILA simulation result with a laminar input
beam.

The thermal wave model is an eﬃcient way to study the beam dynamics of the relativistic
charged particles. The Schr¨odinger-type equation in the model governs the time evolution
of the beam wave function whose magnitude squared is proportional to the particle number
densities[1]. The model has successfully explained the ﬁlamentation of a particle beam and
It was also used to estimate the
the self-pinching equilibrium in collisionless plasma[2].
luminosity in a linear collider where a spherical aberration was present[3]. The model can
also provide some insight on a halo formation by introducing a Gaussian slit[4].

Transverse beam dynamics is another application area of the thermal wave model. In
[5], the authors investigated the beam wave function through a quadrupole magnet
Ref.
with sextupole and octupole perturbations followed by a long drift space under the thin
lens approximation. There is also a paper on the phase space behavior of the particle beam
in the transverse directions where the Wigner and Husimi functions are used as the phase
space distribution functions[6].

In this work, we investigate the transverse beam dynamics in the thermal wave model
by using the functional integral method [7]. Since the method can be extended to the
lattice structure including general quadrupole magnets beyond a thin lens approximation
and it treats the beam optical elements individually, it is possible to systematically analyze
a beam motion in each element under a realistic environment such as a FODO lattice. We
found that the model can successfully explain the PARMILA[8] simulation results by using
a laminar input beam without space charge eﬀects.

In the thermal wave model, the time evolution of the beam wave function for the rela-
tivistic charged particles can be described by the Schr¨odinger-type equation in a transverse
direction as follows,

We can solve the diﬀerential equation by imposing the following two boundary condition,
σ2(z = 0) = σ2
[5]. The σ(z) denotes the root mean square (rms) size
of the beam distribution and ρ(z) is the curvature radius of the beam wave function along
the beam direction.

Another eﬃcient way to solve the diﬀerential equation is known as the functional inte-
gral method [7] where the resulting wave function is given by the product of a kernel (or
propagator) and the initial beam wave function [5],

ψ(xf , zf ) =

dxiK(xf , zf ; xi, zi) ψ(xi, zi).

Since a kernel can represent an optical element like a quadrupole magnet or a drift
space, the functional method can separate a multi-components problem into several single-
component problems. This property is the main advantage of this functional method in the
thermal wave model.

We can obtain the kernels from the path integral method directly as follows,

K(xf , zf ; xi, zi) =

[x(z)] eiS(z)/ǫ,

For the defocusing case the kernel is easily obtained by replacing the cot and csc functions
in Eq.(6) with coth and csch functions, respectively.

Since the potential energy terms are related to linear forces, it is adequate enough to
consider simple Gaussian integrations if the initial beam wave function is a Gaussian-type
as follows,

0 = ǫ/(2√k1). For a defocusing lens, the functions can be obtained by replacing √k1
for the focusing case with i√k1. We can easily check to see if Eq. (8) is the solution of
Eq. (1) by inserting the obtained beam wave function into the diﬀerential equation.

In order to check on the validity of the solutions, we compared them with the PARMILA
simulation result with 50,000 macro particles through the FODO lattice. We selected a
random distribution of the particles in the x-x’ and y-y’ spaces and neglected the space
charge eﬀects. The weighting function of the distribution is a Gaussian-type truncated at
four times the standard deviation.

Since the particle distributions in the x’ or y’ spaces are not reﬂected in the initial
curvature radius, ρ1, we assumed a laminar distribution with constant divergences in the
input beam. In the simulation, we selected 1/ρ1 ≃
0, which means a large value of the twiss
parameter, β, in both horizontal and vertical directions. We note that the input beam can
be treated as a slice of an usual particle distribution in the transverse phase space.

The particle type is proton whose energy is 1 GeV in the calculation. The ﬁeld gradient
and eﬀective length of the quadruople magnets are 10 T/m and 0.4 m, respectively. The
length of the drift space is 1 m. The properties of the input beam are summarized in
Table 1.

Figure 1 shows the particle distributions of the input beam in both horizontal and
vertical directions. The histograms are the PARMILA result with 50,000 macro particles.
The real lines represent the Gaussian input beam of the model calculation. The input
values of σ and ρ are obtained by using their relations to the twiss parameters, α, β, and
γ, and the emittance, ǫ: σ2 = ǫβ and 1/ρ = (1/σ)dσ/dz =
α/β [5]. The numerical values
of the input parameters in the model are given as

σ1 = 2.11 mm ρ1 = 282.38 m

for the horizontal direction,

253.09 m for the vertical direction,

where k1 = qG/(mγrβrc) with the quadrupole ﬁeld gradient, G.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the PARMILA simulations (histograms) and the model
calculations (real-lines) in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The lattice
structure for the horizontal beam is FODO. It is DOFO for the vertical direction. We note
that the thermal wave model describes the simulation result successfully in the transverse
directions. In order to check the result quantitatively, we compared the rms beam sizes
obtained by the model to the values by the best-ﬁt of the PARMILA result. It is summarized
in Table 2. It shows that the model results are the same to the simulation within 1 % level.
In conclusion, we used a functional method to solve the diﬀerential equation given in
the thermal wave model which describes the transverse beam dynamics of the relativistic

4

particles. The main advantage of this functional method is that we can calculate the eﬀects
of each beam optical element separately. The information of each element is summarized in
the kernel. The ﬁnal beam wave function is easily obtained by the Gaussian integration of
the product between the kernel and the initial Gaussian wave function. We found that there
is a good agreement between the PARMILA simulation and the model calculation. Since
the initial beam is limited to a laminar type in this work, the model should be extended to
describe the usual particle distribution in the transverse phase spaces. Even though there
is some limits to the application of this method, this functional method is a very eﬃcient
tool to study the transverse beam dynamics in the thermal wave model.

NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
8. INVARIANT BASES, LOOPS AND KAM

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications of
methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxima-
tions for a number of accelerator physics problems. In this
part we consider variational wavelet approach for loops, in-
variant bases on semidirect product, KAM calculation via
FWT.

INTRODUCTION

This is the eighth part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet analy-
sis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], in which we con-
sidered the applications of a number of analytical methods
from nonlinear (local) Fourier analysis, or wavelet analy-
sis, to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general
and with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum. Wavelet
analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods,
which gives us a possibility to work with well-localized
bases in functional spaces and with the general type of
operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
bases.
In contrast with parts 1–4 in parts 5–8 we try to
take into account before using power analytical approaches
underlying algebraical, geometrical, topological structures
related to kinematical, dynamical and hidden symmetry of
physical problems. In section 2 we consider wavelet ap-
proach for calculation of Arnold–Weinstein curves (closed
loops) in Floer variational approach. In section 3 we con-
sider the applications of orbit technique for constructing
different types of invariant wavelet bases in the particular
case of afﬁne Galilei group with the semiproduct structure.
In section 4 we consider applications of very useful fast
wavelet transform (FWT) technique (part 6) to calculations
in KAM theory (symplectic scale of spaces). This method
gives maximally sparse representation of (differential) op-
erator that allows us to take into account contribution from
each level of resolution.

2 FLOER APPROACH FOR CLOSED

LOOPS

Now we consider the generalization of wavelet variational
approach to the symplectic invariant calculation of closed
loops in Hamiltonian systems [9]. As we demonstrated
in [3]–[4] we have the parametrization of our solution by
some reduced algebraical problem but in contrast to the
cases from parts 1–4, where the solution is parametrized by
construction based on scalar reﬁnement equation, in sym-
plectic case we have parametrization of the solution by ma-
trix problems – Quadratic Mirror Filters equations. Now
we consider a different approach. Let(M, ω) be a compact
symplectic manifold of dimension 2n, ω is a closed 2-form
(nondegenerate) on M which induces an isomorphism
T ∗M
T M . Thus every smooth time-dependent Hamil-

dxH(t, x)ξ for ξ
(and XH ) is periodic in time: H(t + T, x) = H(t, x) and
consider corresponding Hamiltonian differential equation
˙x(t) = XH(t, x(t)) The solutions x(t) determine
on M :
a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms ψt ∈
Diﬀ(M )
satisfying ψt(x(0)) = x(t). These diffeomorphisms are
symplectic: ω = ψ∗
t ω. Let L = LT M be the space of
contractible loops in M which are represented by smooth
curves γ : R
M satisfying γ(t + T ) = γ(t). Then
the contractible T-periodic solutions can be characterized
as the critical points of the functional S = ST : L

Studying the critical points of S is confronted with the
well-known difﬁculty that the variational integral is nei-
ther bounded from below nor from above. Moreover, at
every possible critical point the Hessian of f has an inﬁnite
dimensional positive and an inﬁnite dimensional negative
subspaces, so the standard Morse theory is not applicable.
The additional problem is that the gradient vector ﬁeld on
the loop space L: dγ/ds =
gradf (γ) does not deﬁne
a well posed Cauchy problem. But Floer [9] found a way
to analyse the space
of bounded solutions consisting of
the critical points together with their connecting orbits. He
used a combination of variational approach and Gromov’s
elliptic technique. A gradient ﬂow line of f is a smooth
solution u : R

our approach from preceding parts, which we may apply or
on the level of standard boundary problem or on the level of
variational approach and representation of operators (in our
case, J and
) according to part 6(FWT technique) lead us
to wavelet representation of closed loops.

When we take into account the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian
structures from part 7 we need to consider generalized
wavelets, which allow us to consider the corresponding
structures instead of compactly supported wavelet repre-
sentation from parts 1–4. We consider an important par-

We can solve many important dynamical problems such
that KAM perturbations, spread of energy to higher modes,
weak turbulence, growths of solutions of Hamiltonian
equations only if we consider scales of spaces instead of
one functional space. For Hamiltonian system and their
perturbations for which we need take into account under-
lying symplectic structure we need to consider symplectic
scales of spaces. So, if ˙u(t) = J
K(u(t)) is Hamilto-
nian equation we need wavelet description of symplectic or
quasicomplex structure on the level of functional spaces. It
is very important that according to [12] Hilbert basis is in
the same time a Darboux basis to corresponding symplec-
tic structure. We need to provide Hilbert scale
with
symplectic structure [12]. All what we need is the follow-

[13] general functional spaces and scales of spaces such
as Holder–Zygmund, Triebel–Lizorkin and Sobolev can be
characterized through wavelet coefﬁcients or wavelet trans-
forms. As a rule, the faster the wavelet coefﬁcients decay,
the more the analyzed function is regular [13]. Most im-
portant for us example is the scale of Sobolev spaces. Let

This shows that localization of the wavelet coefﬁcients at

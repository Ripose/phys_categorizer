The ﬁrst attainment of longitudinal spin polarisation in a high energy
electron (positron) storage ring is described.

Summary

An integral part of the design of the HERA ep collider has been the provision of
longitudinally spin polarised electrons for the high energy physics experiments at the
interaction points [1]. At HERA, electrons or positrons of energy up to 30 GeV are
brought into collision with 820 GeV protons.

As outlined in Article I, stored electron beams can become vertically polarised
by the Sokolov–Ternov eﬀect [2]. The maximum ST polarisation achievable is 92.4%
corresponding to a planar ring. To provide longitudinal polarisation at an interaction
point the naturally occuring vertical polarisation in the arcs must be rotated into the
longitudinal direction just before the interaction point (IP) and back to the vertical
just after the IP using special magnet conﬁgurations called spin rotators.

At HERA the spin rotators consist of strings of interleaved horizontal and vertical
bending magnets each of which deﬂects the orbit by no more than about 20 millira-
dians. Dipole rotators exploit the prediction of Eq. (4) in Article I that for motion
transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld, the spin precesses around the ﬁeld at a rate which
is aγ times faster than the rate of rotation of the orbit direction. At HERA energies
aγ is between 60 and 68. So it can be arranged that small commuting deﬂections
of the orbit can result in large noncommuting precessions of the polarisation vector
which can be utilised to rotate the polarisation from the vertical to the longitudinal
direction and vice versa. For HERA, the Mini-Rotator design of Buon and Steﬀen
was adopted [3]. The ﬁrst pair of these spin rotators was intalled at the East straight
section for the HERMES experiment.

Synchrotron radiation not only generates polarisation but can also cause depo-
larisation (Article I). This is especially the case in the presence of spin rotators.
Furthermore the ratio: (depolarisation rate/polarisation rate) increases strongly with
energy. However, the depolarising eﬀects can in principle be minimised by special
choice of the optic called ‘spin matching’ [4]. But owing to the diﬃculty of obtaining
reliable numerical predictions of the polarisation in the presence of rotators through-
out the preparatory stage of the project and because of the initially very pessimistic
aA talk presented at the 15th ICFA Advanced Beam Dynamics Workshop: “Quantum Aspects
of Beam Physics”, Monterey, California, U.S.A., January 1998. Also in DESY Report 98–096,

predictions, it was by no means clear that longitudinal polarisation could be obtained
even after spin matching.

Nevertheless, on the ﬁrst attempt with the rotators switched on at the chosen
energy of 27.5 GeV , a longitudinal electron polarisation of about 56% was attained.
This is to be compared with the 65% polarisation attained immediately beforehand
with the rotators turned oﬀ.

This was the ﬁrst time in the history of high energy storage ring physics that
longitudinal polarisation had been attained. Space limitations prevent my giving
more details here but complete information and diagrams can be found in [1].

Subsequently longitudinal polarisation levels of about 70% for periods of up to ten
hours for positrons in collision with tens of milliamps of high energy protons have been
achieved. Furthermore by measuring the polarisation of individual positron bunches
the inﬂuence of the beam–beam interaction on the polarisation has been observed and
found to be exotic. For example positron bunches in collision with protons can have
a higher polarisation than non–colliding bunches and the polarisation of both groups
of bunches is very sensitive to the tunes of the machine. Obviously, complicated
resonance phenomena are at work [5].

In the year 2000 two more pairs of spin rotators will be installed so that three HERA
experiments can work with longitudinally polarised electrons or positrons.

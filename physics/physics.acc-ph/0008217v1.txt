Abstract
The Front End of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) ex-
tends from the Ion Source (IS), through a 65 keV LEBT, a
402.5 MHz RFQ, a 2.5 MeV MEBT, ending at the entrance
to the DTL. The diagnostics suite in this space includes
stripline beam position and phase monitors (BPM), toroid
beam current monitors (BCM), and an emittance scanner.
Provision is included for beam proﬁle measurement, either
gas ﬂuorescence, laser-based photodissociation, or a crawl-
ing wire. Mechanical and electrical design and prototyping
of BPM and BCM subsystems are proceeding. Signiﬁcant
effort has been devoted to packaging the diagnostic devices
in minimal space. Close ties are maintained to the rest of
the SNS effort, to ensure long term compatibility of inter-
faces and in fact share some design work and construction.
The data acquisition, digital processing, and control system
interface needs for the BPM, BCM, and LEBT diagnostic
are similar, and we are committed to using an architecture
common with the rest of the SNS collaboration.

INTRODUCTION

The SNS Front End consists of an H− Ion Source,
Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a Radio Frequency
Quadrupole (RFQ) with 65 keV injection energy and
2.5 MeV output energy, and a 3.6 m long Medium En-
ergy Beam Transport (MEBT), that matches and chops the
2.5 MeV H− beam before injection into the remainder of
the SNS linac [1].

The extremely compact 65 keV LEBT leaves no room
for conventional diagnostics. Only one measurement of
beam properties remains, a split-collector current measure-
ment, that goes under the name “LEBT Diagnostic.” No
beam diagnostic devices at all are included in the RFQ.

Table 1 shows the instruments that will be assembled
on the 2.5 MeV, 3.6 m long MEBT. Figure 1 shows their
placement along the beam line. This paper will discuss
each of these instruments in turn.

2 LEBT DIAGNOSTIC

Beam current will be monitored on a four-way split elec-
trode (LEBT chopper target), placed at the exit of the
LEBT. The current balance between electrodes at different
times during the chopper cycle can be used to qualitatively
determine offsets from the RFQ axis [2]. With appropriate
manipulation of the beam steering, some information might
be gained about beam size.

3 BEAM POSITION MONITORS

BPMs will be installed in six locations in the MEBT,
spaced roughly every 90◦ of betatron phase advance [3].
The BPMs will primarily be used as a secondary standard
for restoring the beam, where the primary standard is the
null point for quadrupole steering. The BPMs also serve to
measure the trajectory of systematically deﬂected bunches
(this pattern is related to the betatron oscillation of particles
in the bunch, but differs due to space charge effects) and to
provide beam phase information for tuning the longitudinal
optics by way of the rebuncher cavities. Thus, reliability,
repeatability and linearity are more important than initial
zero set.

To minimize the amount of beamline space dedicated to
BPMs, the strips are relatively narrow (22◦) so as to ﬁt be-
tween quadrupole pole tips.

The electrical processing will use the 805 MHz signal
component, since the fundamental 402.5 MHz signal will
be contaminated by fringe ﬁelds from nearby 402.5 MHz
rebuncher cavities.

Since this is a low velocity beam (β = 0.073) wire-based
calibration will not give a proper calibration curve. A sim-
ple numerical model will convert electrical signal strengths
to linearized position.

Measurements of a prototype show the expected shorted
50 Ω stripline behavior, with no spurious resonances below
8 GHz. Construction of all required BPMs is nearly com-
plete.

Figure 1: Overview of MEBT.

Electronics to measure longitudinal bunch information
now uses the signals coming from the BPM pickup, to
avoid the need for separate beamline hardware (see sec-
tion 6 below). For relative phase measurement with a sin-
gle BPM, this is fairly easy. For absolute measurement be-
tween pairs of BPM’s, this requires extra attention to cables
and calibration. All BPMs are installed in the same direc-
tional orientation, so those phase signals can be compared
with no additional sensor calibration term.

cussing magnet pole tips (1.16 diameter), leading to con-
cerns that the DC magnet fringe ﬁeld would saturate por-
tions of the toroid core. The result would be a increased
droop rate, and sensitivity of the measurement results on
quadrupole drive current. Tests have shown this is indeed
the case: with the quadrupole running near its design gra-
dient (38 T/m), the current transformer’s droop approxi-
mately doubles. The design shown above, however, in-
cludes a 3.2 mm thick shield made from mild steel. With
this ﬁeld clamp inserted, the droop of the transformer is not
measurably affected by quadrupole operation.

The transformers have been delivered, the remaining me-
chanical beamline parts have been fabricated, and assembly
is underway.

4 BEAM CURRENT MONITORS

The MEBT beamline includes two current transformers to
measure beam current, one before and one after the MEBT
chopper target. These will be used to measure the cur-
rent waveforms that are generated by the LEBT and MEBT
chopping processes. They also provide the ﬁrst calibrated
measure of beam current and integrated beam charge.

The toroidal transformer is nearly a standard Bergoz
FCT-082-50:1 [6], using a high permeability core to keep
droop to a minimum during the 0.65 µs chopped beam
pulse. These transformers have a measured droop of
0.06 %/µs.

These devices are mounted 37 mm from the main fo-

Figure 4: Wire Scanner concept, with provisions for RGF
or LP device.

5 BEAM PROFILE MONITORS

Measurements of beam proﬁle in the MEBT are considered
essential to check that the transverse beam optics is behav-
ing as intended. In ﬁnal operation of SNS, these measure-
ments should be made without disturbing the operation of
the machine. The two leading contenders to provide such
functionality are Residual Gas Fluorescence (RGF) [4] and
Laser Photodissociation (LP) [5]. Unfortunately, both of
these techniques are considered experimental at this time,
and cannot be counted on to deliver reliable proﬁle data for
beamline commissioning in 2002.

The current plan is to provide conventional crawling
wire scanners, with co-located optical ports, for eventual
addition of an RGF or LP monitor. The wire scanners will
be used ﬁrst to commission the beamline, and then to test
and commission an optical technique.

Brookhaven Nat. Lab. will provide the ﬂange-mounted
wire scanners for the whole SNS project, including the
MEBT. That design will be customized to ﬁt the tight space
allotment. Unlike the ﬁnal optical devices, the wire scan-
ner is intended to work only when the beam runs at reduced
duty factor. Rather than the full 1 ms pulse at 60 Hz, we ex-
pect 100 µm wire to survive 100 µs pulses at 6 Hz (1% of
the nominal 6% duty factor). This is adequate to commis-
sion, but not operate, the accelerator.

The beam box is designed to accept a wire scanner, plus
two pairs (in and out, x and y) of f /2.8 windows on the
beam, and a gas jet that could be part of the ﬂuorescence
experiments. Space is sufﬁciently tight that the beam boxes
will likely be manufactured as part of neighboring compo-
nents (chopper electrodes, chopper target, and emittance
scanner). We hope that this optical access will be sufﬁcient
to deploy a ﬁnal non-invasive proﬁle measurement.

6 EMITTANCE

The 1999 SNS Beam Instrumentation Workshop [7]
strongly recommended that a way be found to measure
the emittance of the beam as it leaves the MEBT on its
way to the DTL. By subsuming phase measurement into
the BPM pickup system, a slit and multisegment collector
assembly (at 51 mm each) could be ﬁt into the beamline.
Note that the drift space between these devices contains
one focussing quadrupole, one BPM, and one proﬁle mon-
itor. The engineering design of this subsystem has started.
The slit cannot absorb the full beam power.

For each position of the movable slit, all the beam di-
vergence information is recorded simultaneously by a seg-
mented collector assembly. Each segment has its own
front-end electronics equipment, consisting of a charge am-
pliﬁer and sample-and-hold.

Table 2 shows a plausible parameter set for the MEBT
emittance device. With these parameters, the error in re-
constructed emittance and the error of the reconstructed
Twiss beta function are typically on the order of 2% or less.

7 SIGNAL PROCESSING ELECTRONICS

The signal processing needs for the BPM, LEBT diag-
nostic, and BCM are similar, both among themselves and
with their cousins in the larger SNS project. Collaborative
and competitive development of electronics is underway at
LBNL, LANL, and BNL.

Most of the relevant information can be collected with
a moderate rate (34-68 MHz), moderate resolution (12-14
bit) digitization of a suitably conditioned signal. We are
investigating digitization and signal processing platforms
that can reliably and cost-effectively deal with this volume
of data, and interact with the Global Controls (EPICS).
That platform would then be used for all BPM, BCM, and
LEBT signal handling, and possibly other uses within SNS.
Each instrument has unique analog signal conditioning
requirements. For BPM processing, at least one channel of
“vector voltmeter” is required to process beam phase infor-
mation. This is expected to function with a mixer and direct
IF sampling. Such processing can also be used for position
readout. Log amp circuitry is also under consideration for
the actual signal strength measurements: it has a dynamic
range advantage over ordinary linear analog processing.

The BCM signal conditioning requirements for the front
end are actually quite modest, essentially a 40 dB ampli-
ﬁer and ﬁlter. This simplicity has to be balanced against
compatibility with the future BCM signal conditioning for
the SNS ring, where the signal has an additional 60 dB of
dynamic range, and turn-turn differences are important [8].

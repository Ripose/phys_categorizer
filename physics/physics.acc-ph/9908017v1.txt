POTENTIAL HAZARDS FROM NEUTRINO RADIATION AT MUON
COLLIDERS

Bruce J. King, Brookhaven National Laboratory 1

Abstract

High energy muon colliders, such as the TeV-scale concep-
tual designs now being considered, are found to produce
enough high energy neutrinos to constitute a potentially se-
rious off-site radiation hazard in the neighbourhood of the
accelerator site. A general characterization of this radiation
hazard is given, followed by an order-of-magnitude calcu-
lation for the off-site annual radiation dose and a discussion
of accelerator design and site selection strategies to mini-
mize the radiation hazard.

INTRODUCTION

Current conceptual designs for muon colliders [1] envis-
age large currents of opposing positively and negatively
charged muons circulating in a collider ring until decay into
neutrinos and electrons:

− → νµ + νe + e
µ
,
µ+ → νµ + νe + e+.

This will produce an intense disk of neutrinos emanating
out in the plane of the collider ring. The vertical angular
divergence of the neutrino disk can be characterized by the
spread in the relative angle between the neutrino and muon
directions and, from relativistic kinematics, the neutrinos in
the forward hemisphere in the muon rest frame are boosted,
in the laboratory frame, into a narrow cone with an opening
half-angle,

θν ≃ sin θν = 1/γ =

mµc2
Eµ

≃ 10−4
Eµ[TeV]

,

(2)

with γ the relativistic boost factor of the muon, Eµ the
muon energy and mµ the muon rest mass.

The vertical angular spread of the neutrino disk could,
in principle, also receive contributions from the angular
spread of the muon beam. However, for reasonable mag-
net lattice designs this will usually produce negligible ad-
ditional divergence everywhere around the collider ring ex-
cept at the ﬁnal focus regions around collider experiments.
The potential radiation hazard comes from the showers
of ionizing particles produced in interactions of neutrinos
in the soil and other objects bathed by the disk. The tiny in-
teraction cross-section for neutrinos is greatly compensated
by the huge number of high energy neutrinos produced at
muon colliders.

2 QUANTITATIVE DERIVATION OF

RADIATION DOSE

A quantitative expression for the radiation dose received
by a person from the decay of Nµ muons of each sign, at
tangential distance L from an idealized perfectly circular
muon collider ring and in the plane of the ring is given by:

where Eν is a function of both integration variables, x and
θ and the variables and form of the expression are explained
in the following paragraphs.

In principle, neutrinos can be emitted in all directions
relative to the muon trajectory at decay so the angle be-
tween the muon beam and the neutrino direction, θ, is
formally integrated over all muon directions around ring,
However, equation 1 shows that most of the contribution to
the radiation dose will come from neutrinos oriented within
of order 1/γ or less from the muon beam direction, so the
size of the collider ring can be ignored. Clearly, a fraction
dθ
2π of the muons will decay in the angular increment dθ
and, for the reasonable assumption that the muon beams
are unpolarized on average, the neutrino decays will be
isotropic in muon rest frame and the fraction of neutrino
decays per unit solid angle in the laboratory rest frame is is

γ = 9.46 × 103 × Eµ[T eV ] and β ≃ 1 for realistic collider
energies. This allows the integration over the laboratory
angle, θ in equation 3 to be replaced by an integration over
the angle in the muon rest frame, θ′.

A biological target in the radiation disk is tangent to
the collider ring in two places and so will receive neutri-
nos from the decays of both positive and negative muons.
Therefore, the neutrino type index, i, runs over all 4 neu-
trino types – νe, νµ, νµ and νe.

The energy probability distribution in the muon rest
frame for the production of neutrino type i is dx · f i

deﬁned as the fraction of the maximum neutrino energy in
the muon rest frame: E′

The cross-section per nucleon, σi(Eν), is expressed, for
now, in the same units of length as L and di(Eν ) is the aver-
age radiation dose from a neutrino of type i and energy Eν
interacting in each nucleon of a biological target, assuming
the equilibrium approximation and expressed in the same
units as Dave.

Most of the ionization energy dose deposited in a person
will come from interactions in the soil and other objects
in the person’s vicinity rather than from the more direct
process of neutrinos interacting inside a person. At TeV
energy scales, much less than one percent of the energy ﬂux
from the daughters of such interactions will be absorbed in
the relatively small amount of matter contained in a person,
with the rest passing beyond the person.

Equation 3 implicitly assumes the simplifying “equilib-
rium approximation” that the ionization energy absorbed
by a person is equal to the energy of the showers initiated
by interactions in that person.

It seems reasonable to assume that the equilibrium ap-
proximation should give either a reasonable estimate or a
conservative overestimate of the radiation dose absorbed by
a person for most of the innumerable possible distributions
of matter. From conservation of energy, it would clearly be
a good approximation for the reference case of a homoge-
neous medium of any density sufﬁcient that the radial ex-
tent of the hadronic and electromagnetic showers initiated
by neutrino interactions is small compared to the height of
the neutrino radiation disk. In realistic geometries, some
of the shower energy will typically leak out to beyond the
extent of the neutrino disk through low density regions of
air etc., presumably decreasing the radiation dose to below
the equilibrium estimate.

The radiation dose in units of Sieverts (Sv) is numeri-
cally almost equal to the energy deposition in a biological
target in units of J/kg for the energetic hadronic and electro-
magnetic showers from neutrino interactions. Therefore, if
ki is deﬁned to be the weighting factor for converting from
neutrino energy to radiation dose for a neutrino of type i
then ki will be numerically equal to the average fraction of
the interaction energy ending up as electrons or hadrons.

The radiation dose per neutrino of energy Eν is then
given by di(Eν )[Sv] ≃ 1.6×10−7×ki×Eν[T eV ]×(103×
NAvogadro), where 1.6×10−7 is the conversion factor from
Joules to TeV and the numerical factor 103 × NAvogadro
arises because Sieverts are deﬁned as energy absorbed per
kilogram rather than per nucleon.

Because neutrino cross-sections are almost linear with
energy in the TeV range they can be expressed as
R[cm2/T eV ]×Eν[T eV ], where the “re-
σi(Eν )[cm2] ≃ σi
duced cross section”, σi
R, can be approximated as a con-
stant over a fairly large energy range.

(NC),

(CC)

It is the subsequent interactions of the daughter hadrons
and electrons, initiating showers of ionizing particles, that
constitute the bulk of the radiation hazard. In contrast, that
part of the neutrino energy transferred into daughter neutri-
nos or muons will almost all be transported to outside the
radiation disk rather than contributing to the energy absorb-
tion of a person within the disk.

It will now be shown that the radiation intensity would
be expected to vary greatly around the neutrino disk, de-
pending on the detailed design of the collider ring magnet
lattice, so the value of Dave by itself is not sufﬁcient to as-
sess the radiation hazard for any particular collider design.
For example, it is clear from the derivation of equation 7

that the radiation contribution tangent to the collider ring at
a dipole bending magnet will be proportional to the beam’s
bending radius at the magnet, which is inversely propor-
tional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

For even bigger variations, tangents to the collider ring
at anywhere other than a dipole magnet the muon currents
will travel in straight line trajectories and the neutrinos will
line up as local radiation “hot spots” in the radiation disk –
cones of more intense radiation with characteristic opening
half-angles of θν = 1/γ.

The contribution from straight sections is given by an

equation analagous to equation 3:

Dss =

where f ss is the length of the straight section as a fraction
of the collider circumference

f ss = L/C

(9)

and the factor γ2/π is the fraction of neutrinos decaying
in the forward direction per unit solid angle after being
boosted from isotropic decays in the muon rest frame into
the laboratory frame.

The summation in equation 8 is now only over the 2 neu-
trino types produced by the sign of muon travelling in the
considered direction, i.e., either νe and νµ for µ− decays
or νµ and νe for µ+ decays (equation 1). The summed
contributions in table 1 for µ+ and µ− are very nearly
equal, so it is reasonable to use the average contribution,
0.402 × 10−35cm2/TeV, for either sign.

Following a similar derivation to that for equation 7 the

numerical value for the dose is:

Dss[Sv] = 1.1×10

−18× f ss × Nµ × (Eµ[T eV ])4

. (10)

(L[km])2

The radiation cones from the ﬁnal focus regions around
collider experiments are important exceptions to equa-
tion 10, since the muon beam itself will have an angular
divergence in these regions that may be large enough to
spread out the neutrino beam by at least an order of magni-
tude in both x and y.

More detailed calculations to check and reﬁne these cal-
culations, using Monte Carlo-based particle tracking com-
puter simulations, are in progress.

On comparing equations 7 and 10 it is easily seen that the
length of straight section to produce an extra contribution
equal to the planar average dose, lequiv, is approximately:
lequiv[meters] ≃ 0.034 × C[km]
Eµ[T eV ]

≃ 0.71

where the ﬁnal expression uses the relation between muon
energy, ring circumference and and average bending mag-
netic ﬁeld in units of Tesla:

C[km] =

2π · Eµ[T eV ]
0.3 · Bave[T ]

,

(12)

valid for a circular ring.

Two mitigating factors come into play at many-TeV en-

ergies to reduce the radiation rise with energy:

1. the neutrino cross section begins to rise signiﬁcantly

less rapidly than linearly with neutrino energy

2. the radiation disk (or cone) becomes so narrow that
the “equilibrium approximation” is no longer accurate
because much of the induced shower of charged par-
ticles leaks out transversely beyond the extent of the
radiation disk. The “cut-off” width at which the equi-
librium approximation will begin to fail badly is the
typical transverse shower size in whatever medium is
initiating the showers. This will be of order a meter
for typical solids. (As an aside, it will be hundreds
of meters in air so the equilibrium approximation will
be overly conservative at all collider energies for peo-
ple in open areas rather than surrounded by massive
objects.)

3 STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE
OFF-SITE RADIATION DOSES

Because of the strong dependence on muon energy, the ra-
diation levels rapidly become a serious design constraint
for colliders at the TeV scale and above. For illustration,
table 2 gives the predicted radiation levels for some exam-
ple muon collider parameter sets [3]. For comparison, the
U.S. federal off-site radiation limit is 10−3 Sv/year, which
is of the same order of magnitude as the typical background
radiation from natural causes (i.e. 0.4 to 4×10−3 Sv/yr [2])
and it is assumed that acceptable radiation levels must be
considerably lower than these values.

As a desirable design strategy for all energies, it is clear
that great care must be taken to minimize or eliminate long
straight sections in the collider ring. For example, the mag-
net lattice could consist partly or entirely of dual function
magnets, where the beam focusing and bend are accom-
plished in the same magnets. Optionally, it might be con-
venient to retain one or two long straight sections by con-
structing radiation enclosures around where their radiation
hot spots exit the ground.

Perhaps the most direct way of decreasing the radiation
levels is to greatly decrease the muon current. This can be
done either by sacriﬁcing luminosity (as in the 4 TeV pa-
rameter set of table 2) or, more attractively, by increasing
the luminosity per given current through better muon cool-
ing or other technological advances.

Further, one might consider placing the accelerator deep
underground so the radiation disk won’t reach the surface
for some distance. For the example of a very ﬂat region
of the Earth the exit distance to the surface Lexit will be
related to the collider depth, D, and the Earth’s radius,
RE = 6.4 × 106m, by Lexit = (2 × D × RE)1/2, where
the three parameters are in consistent units of length, e.g.,
meters. Substituting into equations 7 and 10 gives

respectively, where equations 11 and 12 have been substi-
tuted into the second of these equations.

It is seen that the radiation dose at exit falls inversely
with collider depth. The quadratic dependence of the depth
on Lexit means that exit distances of order 10 km are eas-
ily achievable, but achieving an Lexit of order 100 km is
already starting to require a prohibitively large depth.

Further speculative options that have been discussed in-
clude (i) tilting the ring to take best advantage of the local
topography, (ii) placing the collider ring on a hill so the ra-
diation disk passes harmlessly above the surroundings and,
even more speculatively, (iii) spreading out and diluting the
neutrino radiation disk by continuously sweeping the muon
beam orbit in a vertical plane using dipole corrector mag-
nets.

Even when the preceding strategies have been used, the
strong rise in neutrino energy probably dictates that muon
colliders at CoM energies of beyond a few TeV will proba-
bly have to be constructed at isolated sites where the public
would not be exposed to the neutrino radiation disk at all.
This would deﬁnitely be required for the 10 TeV and 100
TeV parameter sets of table 2. Because of the additional
costs this would involve, these will presumably be “sec-
ond generation” machines, arriving after the technology of
muon colliders has been established in one or more smaller
and less expensive machines built at existing HEP labora-
tories.

In conclusion, some order-of-magnitude calculations
have been presented which show that the neutrino-induced
radiation hazard might be a very serious problem for high
energy muon colliders. The neutrino radiation problem ap-
pears to impose severe constraints on the site selection for
a muon collider complex and on the layout of the complex.
the highest energy muon (and
hadron) colliders and their associated neutrino radiation
disks may be required to be enclosed within a huge new
world HEP laboratory somewhere where there is a large
area of cheap, sparsely populated land.

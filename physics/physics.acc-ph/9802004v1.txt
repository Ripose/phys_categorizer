1 Introduction

In one dimensional model of wake ﬁeld generation by a relativistic electron bunch in a

cold plasma (the beam-generator is modelled by an inﬁnite layer moving in the direction

perpendicular to its surface) a number of interesting results are obtained. In particu-

lar, possibility of acceleration of electrons (positrons) by wake ﬁelds is shown with the

acceleration rate proportional to γ

2 ; (see also the references cited in

≈

[2]) possibility of generation of the ﬁelds exceeding the wave breaking limit by a special

combination of bunches (generator-invertor-dumper) is shown in [3], etc.

However the obtained data require some reﬁnement on the subject of ﬁnite transverse

sizes of bunches, since the bunches of existing and designing accelerators and storage

rings mainly have longitudinal geometry, or some times comparable longitudinal and

In present paper master system of equations for two-dimensional ﬁnite charged rela-

tivistic bunch (of electrons or positrons) moving in cold, collisionless, vortex free, station-

ary plasma with immobile ions are formulated (see also [7]-[8]). The system of nonlinear

equations in partial derivatives is then reduced to the form convinient for further numer-

transverse sizes.

ical analysis.

To check the validity of obtained system of equations two limiting cases are con-

sidered -for inﬁnite wide (transversal) bunch and for inﬁnite long (longitudinal) bunch.

Both cases admit exact analytical solutions, obtained formely in [1] [2] and [4]. Consid-

ered limiting cases of the general system as one should expect, coincide with the main

equations obtained in [2], [4]. The analysis of solutions of mentioned limiting cases from

viewpoint of development of numerical algorithm for solution of the main general system

of equations is also presented. Ranges of parameters values are determined, where non-

stable or nonphysical (ne < 0) solutions take place, when doing numerical calculations,

in particular, at joining the solutions in space regions occupied by a limited bunch and

that free from it, removal of abovementioned limitations on plasma properties, probably

will promote to the clearing up the nature of these nonstable or nonphysical states.

The third obvious check of the validity of the numerical calculations is the passage

to the linear limit, which is considered in a number of papers (see e.g.

[5], [6], [8] and

references therein).

The work is presented in the three parts. Present paper (part I) is devoted to formu-

lation of the system of the master equations of the problem and analytical considerations

of the limiting cases, which have a exact solutions [1]-[6] (transversal and longitudinal

ﬂat bunches, linear approximation). Presented consideration gives some hints to the

construction of proper algorithm for numerical calculations.

The second part (II) will be devoted to the construction of the algorithm for numerical

calculations of the system of basic equations of the problem for the general case of the

bunch of ﬁnite transversal and longitudinal dimensions.

The third part (III) will present the results of numerical calculations, their analysis

and comparison with the existing analytical results.

this solution corresponds to the vortex free motion of the plasma electrons considered

in [7], [8], [4]. The eqs. (4,5) along with Maxwell’s equations for the ﬁeld potentials,

with charges and currents corresponding to the motion in plasma bunch charges (which

is supposed to be given– rigid bunch approximation) form a complete system of equations

of the cold vortex free hydrodynamic plasma model, with immobile ions.

and we will normalize the density of plasma electrons and bunch charges on plasma ions

density n0. Introduce also plasma frequency ωp and wavelength λp

ωp = (4πe2n0/m)1/2,

λp = c/ωp

(8)

we will use dimensionless coordinates (in units of λp) and dimensionless time (in units of
ω−1
p ); 4-momenta of plasma electrons represent in the form (ǫ, ~pc) = mc2(γ, ~βγ), Lorentz
factor and velocity of bunch charges denote as γ0, ~β0c.

Let’s choose a calibrating function χ = 0. As a result we obtain a full system of

equations for the considered plasma-electron bunch model:

where ne is the plasma electrons density, nb is the bunch charges density (positive for

electrons and negative for bunches consisting of positively charged particles).

As one can see from relations (9) and (10) components of 4-potential are connected

on mass surface of plasma electrons:

This follows from the selection of calibration function χ = 0; i.e. (13) is a calibrating

condition on potentials. Calibration of potentials (13) we will call ”energetic”.

From eqs. (11) and (12) also follows continuity equation for plasma electrons:

We are interested in steady state wake ﬁeld solutions of eqs. (9-12), i.e. only on those in

which longitudinal dependence of all variables is determined by the longitudinal position

of point of observation relative to the bunch. Assuming that the bunch propagates along

also will denote as z. Let us consider the case when all the physical variables depend on

transverse coordinate y only (ﬂat bunch with horizontal dimensions much more greater

than vertical one). Then we obtain three scalar eqs. for three values f, ay, az and unknown

At numeric modelling of the system of equations (25-29) one of eqs (27), (28) can be

replaced by the eq. (30).

One can reduce eqs (25-29) to eqs. for ay, ˜v, ˜µ. To do so, one can express N e.g. from

(27) and deﬁne ˜u from (29). Eventually we obtain the system of equations

Below we will use bunch models symmetrical with respect to y axis. In this case one

can easily note, that functions ay and ˜µ are odd functions on y, ˜v is an even one.

Also note, that nondisturbed plasma (no charged particles bunches and wake ﬁelds)

corresponds to the following values of variables:

˜v = γ0,

˜u = β0γ0, N = 1,

ay = ˜µ = 0

It is also interesting to write the equations in the form when the calibrating condition

(29)is an integral of motion of the diﬀerential equations. This can be done by involving the

plasma electrons density among the unknown functions. Monitoring of this parameter is

useful also from the physical viewpoint. Let’s write these eqs. for deviations of functions

˜u, ˜v and N from the vacuum values:

˜u = βγ + χ,

˜v = γ + λ,

N = 1 + ν.

In spite of rather unwieldy form of eqs. (38-41) they have a number of advantages for

numerical calculations. Firstly, the relationship (42) follows from eqs. (38-41) and it can

used for veriﬁcation of calculations. Secondly, from eqs. (38-41) one can easily come to

the linear case corresponding to the bunches with low density. In so doing the linearized

The linearized eqs. are also a convinient testing area for numerical methods in going

to the nonlinear eqs.

3 Limiting Cases of the Master Equations

Let us consider two limiting cases of equations (25-27): previously considered case of

bunch with inﬁnite transverse sizes and case of bunch with ﬁnite transverse and inﬁnite

longitudinal sizes. One can note, that in both cases from the formulation of the problem

follows, that there is no plasma electrons ﬂow along the axis y, i.e βy = 0 and

Taking into account (48) one can reduce (31-33) to

ay = 0.

In the case of inﬁnite transverse size there are no dependence of all variables on y.

This case is described by a single equation for ˜v:

Analoguous equation was obtained previously in [2] and was a subject on analysis in

a series of papers e.g. [7],[8], [3]. Note, that condition (8) of absence of vortex

form solutions for combined bunches moving in plasma and generating no wake ﬁelds [3].

Solution for a bunch with given d, nb, β0 must be joined with wave solution for a free

plasma beyond the bunch (wake waves with nb = 0, phase velocity of waves coincides

with velocity of the bunch vph = v0 [1], [2]). In doing so no additional limitations arise if

possible that the wake ﬁeld will break behind the bunch if the wave amplitude is large

enough imidiately behind the bunch.

In the other (longitudinal) limiting case there is no dependence of all variables on

˜z. Physically such conditions can be realized for long enough bunches far from the

bunche’s head. The linearized problem for semi-inﬁnite bunch in cylindrical geometry

was considered in [12]. A tensor of dielectric permeability was introduced to connect the

by concomitant ﬁelds. The transition ﬁelds arising at injection decrease exponentially.

In the case when the bunch transverse size is much smaller than the plasma wave length,

a return current, concentrated in the bunch transverse section, arizes.

In the other

limiting case, the transverse section of the return current is much greater than the bunch

transverse section.

Since ﬁnally we will be interested in restricted in transverse direction bunches (nb = 0

at

y

|

> b, 2b is the width of ﬂat bunch), the case nb=0 requires an additional consid-

eration. Passing from the region occupied by bunch (
|

y

| ≤

b) to the region without it

needs the physical solutions, corresponding to the null value of all physical quantities

(electromagnetic ﬁelds, pulses of plasma electrons) at y
which must be joined with the solutions inside the bunch, where nb 6

→ ±∞

. These are the solutions

= 0. For hyperbolic

15

phase trajectories (corresponding to the case nb = 0) the separatrices passing through

the unstable (hyperbolic) immobile point are the only suitable trajectories. Passing along

two branches of separatrices requires inﬁnite long ”time-development” on parameter y.

Construction of solutions, corresponding to the bunches ﬁnite with respect to y, can

be done in the following way. Branches of separatrix nb = 0, realizing the motion in y from

the side surfaces of the bunch to the inﬁnity are to be superimposed on phase trajectories

corresponding to the position of (β0, nb) in one of the regions I,II, III. Separatrix branches

intersect many phase trajectories-diﬀerent choices of intersection regions correspond to

the diﬀerent widths of bunches with the same values of parameters (nb, β0). Figs. 8 and

9 represent the process for construction of solutions in regions II and III.

Fig. 8. Formation of physical solutions for limited along y bunches; nb=0.4, β 0=0.85. 
Branches of separatrix for nb=0 are shown, which realize transition to ±∞ along y axis.
One of combined trajectories is shown, the interval of phase trajectory between
branches of separatrix correspond to the solution inside the bunch.  

Fig. 9. Formation of physical solutions for limited bunches (nb=0.7, β0=0.85, II
region) analogous to Fig. 7. Arrows show the limiting combined phase trajectory
corresponding to the plasma electrons density ne=0 on the R axis. 

Note an important circumstance. There are no transverse motion of plasma electrons

in adopted model and adjacent layers of plasma slide one with respect to other (because

we neglect the plasma viscosity). In such a formulation the continuity equation is satisﬁed

automatically and from the mathematical viewpoint there are solutions with any values

16

of ne, including negative ones, found, in particular in [2], [4].

However, clearly such solutions are not physical and are to be discarded. In [4] an

illegitimate, (by our opinion), attempt is done to interpret the regions with negative ne

as channels from which all plasma electrons are displaced.

Using the formula (24) and relation (60) one can obtain the following expression for

plasma electrons density:

ne = γ0chR(1

β0thR)(

E +

−

−

(R′)2).

(67)

From (67) follows that ne can alter its sign, and it can take place only if E > 0.

Indeed, as it is seen from construction of physical solutions by means of joining of phase
trajectories for nb 6
= 0 with branches of separatrix at nb = 0, such a combined phase
trajectory always intersects the R axis (R′ = 0). Thus, for positive E inside the bunch

ne < 0. It is clear, that there are no physical solutions when nb > 1/(1

β0) (region I

−

of values (nb, β0)), since the minimum values of corresponding potential pits are positive.

In contrary, in the region III (nb < 1/(1 + β0)) the condition E < 0 does not impose any

additional limitations, since the regions for joining of solutions correspond to E < E0,

where E0 < 0 is the maximum value of potential U(R).

Lastly, in the II region (1/(1

β0) > nb > 1/(1 + β0)) intervals of phase trajectories

−

necessary for joining with branches of the immobile point of phase trajectories correspond

to the energy values E > 0, when nb > 1. Therefore at 1/(1

β0) > nb > 1 inside bunch

−

always ne < 0. Such solutions as it was mentioned above are not physical by our opinion.

In the region 1 > nb > 1/(1 + β0) the condition ne > 0 is not satisﬁed for a limited set of
values of energy only (nb −
to the ”time” which is necessary for passing the section of phase trajectory at E = 0

1 < E < 0). The maximum allowed bunch width corresponds

between the branches of separatrix, where nb = 0.

In ﬁg. 9 arrows indicate the limiting combined phase trajectory corresponding to the

plasma electrons density ne = 0 in the middle of bunch. Phase trajectories right to the

limiting one correspond to the nonphysical (ne < 0) solutions.

Complete sweeping of plasma electrons by the bunch, i.e. formation of a channel in

17

plasma take place at (R′)2 = 2
is satisﬁed in the middle of bunch (R′ = 0) at E = 0, i.e. at R = arcth(β0/(1

0. In particular, this condition, as it was mentioned,

0 ))

≥

−

in an immobile point of the region I, (which is unstable for region III).

Thus, summarising the contents of the presented consideration one can note, that for

a transversely inﬁnite bunch at nb < 1/(1 + β0) physical solutions exist for bunches of

any width. In the case 1/(1 + β0) < nb < 1 physical solutions exist for bunches of limited

width only. When nb > 1 in the middle of bunch ne < 0 and we discard such a solutions

as nonphysical ones for considered formulation of the problem (collisionless, stationary,

vortexless, cold plasma).

Very likely that consideration of the problems which takes into account violation

of stationary condition, thermal motion of plasma electrons and ions, plasma viscosity

possibly will allow to clear out the physical nature of these nonstable or ”nonphysical”

solutions.

It is necessary to remember that states with ne < 0 are obtained in very long or very

wide bunches. The ﬁnite dimensions of real bunches can change the domain of existance

of these states or even eliminate them completely. Linear approximation to the limiting

cases of formulated problem, discussed particularly in [5], [6], [8], is valid, when bunch

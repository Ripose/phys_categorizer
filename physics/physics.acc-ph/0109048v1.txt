Abstract. This paper discusses the undulator radiation emitted by high-energy positrons during planar channel-
ing in periodically bent crystals. We demonstrate that the construction of the undulator for positrons with energies
of 10 GeV and above is only possible if one takes into account the radiative energy losses. The frequency of the
undulator radiation depends on the energy of the particle. Thus the decrease of the particle’s energy during the
passage of the crystal should result in the destruction of the undulator radiation regime. However, we demonstrate
that it is possible to avoid the destructive inﬂuence of the radiative losses on the frequency of the undulator radi-
ation by the appropriate variation of the shape of the crystal channels. We also discuss a method by which, to our
mind, it would be possible to prepare the crystal with the desired properties of its channels.

INTRODUCTION

We discuss a mechanism, initially proposed in [1, 2], for the generation of high-energy photons by means of planar
channeling of ultra-relativistic positrons through a periodically bent crystal. In this system there appears, in addition
to the well-known channeling radiation, an undulator type radiation due to the periodic motion of the channeling
positrons which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes. The intensity and the characteristic frequencies
of this undulator radiation can be easily varied by changing the positrons energy and the parameters of the crystal
bending.

The mechanism of the photon emission by means of the crystalline undulator is illustrated in ﬁgure 1. It is
important to stress that we consider the case when the amplitude a of the bending is much larger than the interplanar
10 d), and, simultaneously, is much less than the period l of the bending
spacing d (
(a

8 cm) of the crystal (a
4 l ).

∼
In addition to the spontaneous photon emission the scheme leads to the possibility to generate stimulated emission.
This is due to the fact, that the photons emitted at the points of maximum curvature of the trajectory travel almost
parallel to the beam and thus, stimulate the photon generation in the vicinity of all successive maxima and minima of
the trajectory.

∼

The bending of the crystal can be achieved either dynamically or statically. In [1, 2] it was proposed to use a
transverse acoustic wave to bend the crystal dynamically. The important feature of this scheme is that the time period
of the acoustic wave is much larger than the time of ﬂight of a bunch of positrons through the crystal and thus the
crystal bending does not change on this time scale. One possibility to create acoustic waves in a crystal is to place a
piezo sample atop the crystal and to use radio frequency to excite oscillations.

The usage of a statically and periodically bent crystal was discussed in [3]. The idea is to construct a crystalline

undulator based on graded strained layers. We will present a detailed description how a static crystalline undulator can
be produced.

We now consider the conditions for stable channeling. The channeling process in a periodically bent crystal takes
mg c2/Rmin (Rmin being the minimum curvature radius
place if the maximum centrifugal force in the channel, Fcf
of the bent channel), is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar ﬁeld, Fint which is equal to the maximum
gradient of the interplanar ﬁeld (see [2]). More speciﬁcally, the ratio C = Fcf/Fint has to be smaller than 0.15, otherwise
the phase volume of channeling trajectories is too small (see also [4]). Thus, the inequality C < 0.15 connects the
energy of the particle, e = mg c2, the parameters of the bending (these enter through the quantity Rmin), and the
characteristics of the crystallographic plane.

≈

A particle channeling in a crystal (straight or bent) undergoes scattering by electrons and nuclei of the crystal.
These random collisions lead to a gradual increase of the particle energy associated with the transverse oscillations in
the channel. As a result, the transverse energy at some distance Ld from the entrance point exceeds the depth of the
interplanar potential well, and the particle leaves the channel. The quantity Ld is called the dechanneling length [5].
To calculate Ld one may follow the method described in [6, 7]. Thus, to consider the undulator radiation formed in a
crystalline undulator, it is meaningful to assume that the crystal length does not exceed Ld.

In [7] we estimated the parameters a and l

for given energy e , regarding the dechanneling length of the bent crystal
and the reduction of the phase-space volume due to the bending. For 500 MeV positrons in Si(110) the optimal
parameters are a/d = 10 and l = 2.335
3 cm. The spectral distribution of the emitted radiation in this case is

discussed in the next section (see also [7]).

In the present paper we discuss the possibility to construct undulators to generate photons with energies larger than
1 MeV using positron energies above 10 GeV when the radiative energy losses cannot be neglected and, thus, must be
taken into account [4].

The frequency of photons generated in the undulator is determined by the energy of the projectiles and also by
the undulator parameter (for deﬁnition see equation (1)). In the regime in which the energy of the projectiles is not
constant during their passage through the undulator, the frequency of the emitted undulator radiation can nevertheless
be kept constant if one chooses the appropriate variation of the shape of the undulator along its length.

We also discuss a method by which, to our mind, it would be possible to prepare crystals with the desired properties

of their channels.

SPECTRA OF THE SPONTANEOUS EMITTED RADIATION

To illustrate the undulator radiation phenomenon, which we discuss, let us consider the spectra of spontaneous
radiation emitted during the passage of positrons through periodically bent crystals.

The photon emission spectra have been calculated using the quasiclassical method [8]. The trajectories of the
particles were calculated numerically and then the spectra were evaluated [7]. The latter include both radiation
mechanisms, the undulator and the channeling radiation.

The spectral distributions of the total radiation emitted in forward direction for e = 500 MeV positrons channeling
in Si along the (110) crystallographic planes are plotted in ﬁgure 2. The wavelength of the crystal is ﬁxed at
l = 2.335

The ﬁrst graph in ﬁgure 2 corresponds to the case of the straight channel (a/d = 0) and, hence, presents the spectral
dependence of the ordinary channeling radiation only. Increasing the a/d ratio leads to modiﬁcations in the spectrum
of radiation. The changes which occur manifest themselves via three main features: the lowering of the ordinary
channeling radiation peak, the gradual increase of the intensity of undulator radiation due to the crystal bending and
the appearing of additional structure (the sub-peaks) in the vicinity of the ﬁrst harmonic of the ordinary channeling
radiation. A more detailed analysis of these spectra can be found in [7].

To check our numerical method, we have calculated the spectrum of the pure channeling radiation for 6.7 GeV
positrons in Si(110) integrated over the emission angles. Figure 3 shows the experimental data [9, 10] and the results
of our calculations, normalized to the experimental data in the vicinity of the second harmonic.

The energy and the spectral dependence of the calculated spectra is in good agreement with the experimental
data. The ﬂuctuations at high energies are an artifact of our numerical method. Increasing the number of calculated
trajectories will reduce these ﬂuctuations but also increase the computation time.

The height of the ﬁrst harmonic is overestimated in our calculations. The calculations performed in [9] give a similar
result. This disagreement arises likely due to the neglection of multiple collisions both in our work and in [9]. The
shape and the location of the ﬁrst harmonic are described quite well. This fact demonstrates that the Molière potential
is a good approximation for the interplanar potential, because the spectral distribution of the channeling radiation is
highly sensitive to the shape of the interplanar potential.

UNDULATOR EFFECT IN THE HIGH-ENERGY REGIME

Spectra of channeling and undulator radiation presented in the previous section have been calculated in the regime
in which the energy losses of the positrons during their passage through the crystal are negligible. In this section, we
analyze the opposite situation, which occurs when the energy of the projectiles becomes sufﬁciently large (above 10
GeV). On the ﬁrst glance, the undulator phenomenon can hardly take place in this energy range, because the energy of
positrons during their passage through the crystal can no longer be considered as constant due to the radiative energy
losses [4].

Indeed, the frequency w

und of the ﬁrst harmonic of the undulator radiation in the forward direction is given by

[2, 11]:

Here we use w 0 = 2p c/l and the undulator parameter pund is deﬁned as pund = g 2p a/l

Equation (1) shows that the frequency of the emitted radiation depends on the energy of the projectile. If the decrease
(1)
of the particle’s energy due to the radiative losses is signiﬁcant (g (z) < g 0 for z > 0), the frequency w
und becomes
dependent on the particle’s penetration distance z into the crystal. The decrease of the particle’s energy leads to the
broadening of the undulator lines in the photon emission spectrum and the reduction of their intensity.

However, the monochromaticity of the undulator radiation in the high-energy regime can be restored if one allows
the variation of the shape of the crystal channels. Let us consider this condition in more detail and assume that the
shape of the channels in the crystal is as follows:

S(z) = a(z) sin(j (z))

with j (z) =
the penetration depth z.

require C(z) = C = const. It was shown in [7, 11], that the parameter C is the essential characteristic for the channeling

l 2(z)/(4p a(z)) is the curvature radius of the shape function S(z) in the points of its extrema. The formula,
Here Rmin
connecting Rmin, l (z) and a(z), is written as for the pure sine function with constant a(z) and l (z). This can be done,
because the parameters a(z) and l (z) change slowly with increasing z and can be assumed to be constant on the length
of a single undulator period. This assumption allows one to describe the bent channel locally by the sine function.
Rewriting equation (3), we derive the following expression for the amplitude a(z):

Substituting (4) in (1), one derives the following cubic equation for l (z):

Equations (4) and (7) contain the dependence g (z) which describes the decrease of the particle’s energy in the crystal
due to the radiative energy losses. For comparatively low energies of the projectile (e < 10GeV ) this dependence can
be calculated using the approach suggested in [4]. To describe the radiative losses of particles in the high-energy
regime, one has to modify the formulas outlined in [4]. Namely, it is necessary to replace the dechanneling length Ld
by the inﬁnitesimal interval dz and also use inﬁnitesimal intervals for the energy loss. Physically, this means that in
the high-energy regime the particle’s energy changes over distances which are much smaller than the dechanneling
length. Thus, the dependence of g on the penetration depth into the crystal is given by:

dg
dz

.

The deﬁnition of G(g ,C) and the related details can be found in [4]. G includes the averaging over all possible

trajectories of the channeled particles.

Solving (8) numerically over the z-interval equal to the dechanneling length one obtains the radiative losses. The
result of this calculation for C = 0.15 is shown in ﬁgure 4. For the sake of comparison, we also plot the dependence
of the radiative energy losses in the low energy regime [4]. As expected, the self-consistent losses grow up slower at
large energies and for e > 100 GeV the losses saturate at 1. For energies below 15 GeV the difference between the two
approaches is negligible small. The absolute values of the radiative loss become negligible for positron energies below
5 GeV, which corresponds to the results derived in [4].

Thus, starting from (8) and the initial values e 0, a0 and l 0, one can calculate the energy e (z) as a function of the
penetration distance z. Equations (4) and (7) allow then the derivation of l (z) and a(z). The ansatz (2) then determines
the shape S(z) of the channel. The latter, in turn, ensures that the frequency of the undulator radiation and the parameter
C remain constant during the passage of the positrons through the crystal, even in the regime in which the radiative
energy losses are high. We consider the possibility of the construction of such bent crystals in the next section.

To illustrate the described method we consider positrons with an initial energy of 50 GeV channeling in Si(110).

Figures 5 and 6 show the results of the calculations.

GROWING OF CRYSTALS WITH PERIODICALLY BENT CHANNELS

In this section we propose a method of preparing crystals with periodically bent channels whose shape function S(z)
has either the pure sine form, a sin kz, or a more general one deﬁned by (2).

In [13] the deﬂection of proton beams by means of strained crystal layers was demonstrated. The construction of

the crystals was described and experimental data that proves the deﬂection of protons was presented.

Using well-known methods of crystal growing (like molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition, see the
references in [13]) it is possible to add single crystal layers onto a substrate. Let us consider a pure silicon substrate on
which a Si1
xGex layer is added (x denotes the germanium content in this layer). The doping with germanium leads to
the enlargement of the lattice constant of the added layer. The strain due to the lattice mismatch of the substrate and the
xGex layer leads to an increase of the lattice spacing perpendicular to the surface of the substrate (the ˜z-direction
Si1
in ﬁgure 7). The lattice constant parallel to the surface remains unchanged.

Prior to discussing the growing of periodically bent channels, let us summarize the main ideas presented in [13] that
we need for our description. The spacing between the (100) layers is dSi = 1.358 Å in Si and dGe = 1.414 Å in Ge.
The distance between two Si1
dSi. In [13] the critical
thickness of the strained layer is discussed. If the thickness of the strained layer is larger than the critical value hc, then
lattice defects appear and destruct the channels.

xGex layers is given by d(x) = dSi + D d

x, where D d = dGe

−

−

·

To obtain periodically bent channels, one starts with a pure silicon substrate and adds Si1

xGex layers with
continuously increasing Ge content. This results in bending of the (110) channels in the direction of the (100) channels.
The periodicity of the shape requires the change of the direction of the bending toward the (010) channels. This, in
turn, can be achieved by reducing x until it reaches 0. Figure 7 schematically illustrates the ﬁrst period of the bent
(110) channel.

The last (within the ﬁrst period) crystal layer consists of pure silicon, so that the second period can be built up on
top of the ﬁrst in the same manner. To be captured by the bent channel, the positron beam should be directed towards

The crystal strain is strongest after half a period, when the germanium content reaches its maximum. The thickness
of the layers corresponding to half a period needs to be smaller than the critical thickness hc. If this condition is met,
then crystals with arbitrary number of undulator periods can be constructed.

We now present the formulas that allow to calculate the germanium content x(˜z) as a function of the thickness ˜z of

the crystal for a given shape S(z).

The maximum germanium content is 5%. The layer thickness that corresponds to half a period is given by

The second example concerns the shape function given by (2) with a(z) and l (z) as in ﬁgure 6. To ﬁnd the
dependence x(˜z) in this case is not so straightforward as for the sine proﬁle. Indeed, if one starts integrating (9)
from z = 0, then the solution results in negative values of x(˜z). To understand this non-physical result we take a closer
look at (9). For small x this equation acquires the following approximate form:

In this work we have discussed the high-energy regime of the undulator radiation emitted by ultra-relativistic positrons
channeling in periodically bent crystal channels.

This regime is typical for positron energies well above 10 GeV, when the channeling effect is accompanied by
noticeable radiative losses. The latter, being mainly due to the channeling radiation, lead to the gradual decrease of the
positron energy. This, in turn, strongly inﬂuences the stability of the parameters of the emission of undulator radiation.
We demonstrated that the frequency of the undulator radiation can be maintained constant provided the parameters
of the periodic bending are changed with the penetration distance to take into account the decrease of the projectile
energy.

Our investigation shows that the discussed modiﬁcation of the shape of the crystal channels allows the generation
of undulator radiation of high-energy photons (up to tens of MeV). The calculation of the spectral distributions of the
emitted photons in this regime is currently in progress and will be reported soon.

We described a method that should allow the growing of the crystal channels that are necessary for the experimental
measurement of the photon spectra. The feedback from experimentalists would be very helpful to check the models
and assumptions that were used in this work.

The research was supported by DFG, BMBF and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

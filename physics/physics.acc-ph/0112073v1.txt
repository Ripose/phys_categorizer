Improved alternating gradient transport and focusing of neutral molecules

Polar molecules, in strong-ﬁeld seeking states, can be transported and focused by an alternating
sequence of electric ﬁeld gradients that focus in one transverse direction while defocusing in the other.
We show, by calculation and numerical simulation, how one may greatly improve the alternating
gradient transport and focusing of molecules. We use a new optimized multipole lens design, a
FODO-lattice beam transport line, and lenses to match the beam transport line to the beam source
and to the ﬁnal focus.

We derive analytic expressions for the potentials, ﬁelds, and gradients that may be used to design
these lenses. We describe a simple lens optimization procedure and derive the equations of motion
for tracking molecules through a beam transport line. As an example, we model a straight beamline
that transports a 560 m/s jet-source beam of methyl ﬂuoride15 m from its source and focuses it to 2
mm diameter. We calculate the beam transport line acceptance and beam survival, for a beam with
a velocity spread, and estimate the transmitted intensity for speciﬁed source conditions. Possible
applications are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

A polar molecule has an intrinsic separation of charge
on which an electric ﬁeld gradient exerts a force. The
force, Fx, in the (transverse) x direction is:

Fx = −

where W is the potential energy of the molecule in an
electric ﬁeld E (Stark eﬀect) of magnitude E = (E2
x +
y )1/2; and similarly for the force, Fy in the y direc-
E2
tion. The force and gradient are in opposite directions
(weak-ﬁeld seeking) for rotational states that become less
tightly bound in an electric ﬁeld (∂W/∂E > 0), while the
force and gradient are in the same direction (strong-ﬁeld
seeking) for rotational states that become more tightly
bound in an electric ﬁeld (∂W/∂E < 0). The J = 0 state
is always strong-ﬁeld seeking and all rotational states be-
come strong-ﬁeld seeking in the limit of strong electric
ﬁeld as shown in Fig. 1.

Focusing a beam of molecules, traveling in the z di-
rection, is achieved using static two-dimensional (x, y)
electric ﬁeld gradients. We neglect end ﬁeld eﬀects and
assume Ez = 0 inside the focusing lenses. Molecules
in weak-ﬁeld seeking states can be focused, in both di-
rections, using quadrupole and/or sextupole ﬁelds that
have a minimum in the electric ﬁeld in both directions.
Molecules in strong-ﬁeld seeking states, however, can be
focused in only one transverse direction, while being de-
focused in the other, because it is not possible to have a
maximum in the electric ﬁeld in both dimensions (in free
space).

Molecules in strong-ﬁeld seeking states have been
transported and focused by an alternating sequence of
electric ﬁeld gradient lenses [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (as have
neutral atoms [8]), but it has been neither as success-
ful, nor as widely used, as has quadrupole and sextupole
focusing for molecules in weak-ﬁeld seeking states [7, 9].
In this paper we show, by calculation and numerical
simulation, how one may greatly improve the alternat-
ing gradient transport and focusing of molecules by op-
timizing the lens ﬁeld geometries so that nonlinearity in
∂W/∂E is compensated by ∂E/∂x to produce a linear
restoring force. We use this optimized multipole lens de-
sign in a FODO-lattice beam transport line and use ad-
ditional lenses to match the beam transport line to the
beam source and to the ﬁnal focus.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II discusses alternating gradient focusing, trans-
port lattices, matching lenses, and linear optics. Section
III derives the formulae for designing linear focusing ele-
ments and presents examples of lenses. Section IV derives
the equations for molecular beam transport and models
both a simple 30 m-long FODO lattice and a complete
15 m-long transport line with entrance and exit matching
lenses. Section IV G estimates the intensity of a methyl
ﬂuoride jet-source beam, transported through a beamline
and focused. Section V discusses the use of strong-ﬁeld
seeking states, and possible applications of alternating
grading focusing and transport through very long beam-
lines.

II. ALTERNATING GRADIENT BEAM
TRANSPORT AND FOCUSING

A beam of charged particles can be focused and trans-
ported over almost unlimited distances by alternating F
and D type magnetic quadrupole lenses. The F type lens
focuses the beam in the horizontal (x) direction while

which the F/D- lenses are separated by drift spaces (O).
To match the molecular beam source to the transport
line, and to match the transport line to the ﬁnal focus, we
use doublet (FD/DF) and triplet (FDF/DFD) type lens
conﬁgurations. These lens conﬁgurations generally re-
quire higher focusing strengths than do the FODO cells.
Doublets are typically used for asymmetric focal points
(unequal x and y dimensions) while triplets are used for
symmetric ones. In the F/D doublet, a net focusing in x
and y occurs because particles ﬁrst focused in x are, in
the second element, closer to the axis and therefore less
defocused. Particles ﬁrst defocused in y are, in the second
element, further from the axis and thus more strongly fo-
cused.

In all lenses, linear focusing is needed for optimum
optical properties. Linear focusing requires that the
force in each direction be linearly proportional to the
displacement in that direction (|Fx/x| = constant and
|Fy/y| = constant), and independent of the displacement
in the other direction (uncoupled motion). Strong non-
linearities in focusing elements will result in loss of beam,
generation of beam halo, and growth in the transverse
emittance (the product of the angular divergence and
the spatial dimension) producing larger beam sizes.

III. LINEAR OPTICS

FIG. 1:
Energy levels of low-lying rotational states of a
diatomic or symmetric-top molecule in an electric ﬁeld (Stark
eﬀect). The levels were calculated using the rigid rotor model.
The horizontal axis is in dimensionless units of ω = deE/B,
where de is the electric dipole moment, E the electric ﬁeld,
and B the rotational constant. The vertical axis is in units
of B. Energies for small ω are shown in (a) and energies for
large ω in (b). The potential energy of the molecule, W , is
the change in energy from zero electric ﬁeld and for very large
ωW → deE. The levels that descend are strong-ﬁeld seeking
(see text). For the J = 0 state of methyl ﬂuoride (CH3F), in
the K = 0 state, ω = 1 at 2.78 MV/m. For the J = 0 state
of CsF, ω = 1 at 0.135 MV/m.

defocusing it in the vertical (y) direction. The D type
defocuses the beam in the horizontal direction while fo-
cusing it in the vertical direction.

A complete alternating gradient transport line begins
with a beam source whose output is optically matched, by
lenses, into the acceptance of a transport section which
in turn is matched, by lenses, to a ﬁnal focus. The ﬁnal
focus can be, for example, at an experimental target or
at a matching point for injection into a (storage) ring
lattice. A complete transport line for molecules, starting
with a jet source and skimmer, is shown in Fig. 2. For
long-distance beam transport, the lens system providing
the highest beam acceptance and requiring the lowest
focusing strength is a lattice of identical FODO-cells, in

A. Potential energy of a molecule in an electric
ﬁeld

To determine the lens shape that will produce the
most linear force on the molecule, we need ∂W/∂E for
Eq. (1). This quantity will change with the J, |mJ | rota-
tional state and the electric ﬁeld strength. If a number
of rotational levels have a similar ∂W/∂E, then one lens
design will be nearly optimum for all of them.
In the
limiting case of a strong electric ﬁeld (large ω in Fig. 1 ),
∂W/∂E = −de.

For polar molecules in weaker ﬁelds, we calculate the
interaction energy, in the rigid rotor approximation, fol-
lowing the approach of von Meyenn [10]. The Hamilto-
nian operator is H = BJ2 − deE cos θ, where B is the
rotational constant, and the direction cosine matrix ele-
ments, which couple (J, mJ ) with (J +1, mJ ) and (J −1,
mJ ), are taken from Townes and Schawlow [11]. We di-
agonalize the matrix for terms through J = 30. The ﬁrst
few levels are shown in Fig. 1. As ω = deE/B and B
determine the Stark eﬀect for each J, |mJ |, it is straight
forward to construct a simple function for the Stark ef-
fect for any J, |mJ |. For the J = 0 state of a diatomic
molecule or symmetric top (K = 0) molecule, a satisfac-
tory approximation [12] is:

with C1 = −0.2085 and C2 = 0.2445. This expression
works best for small and intermediate values of ω.

Finally, we note that all atoms and molecules, includ-
ing nonpolar molecules, are polarizable with an interac-

larizability [13, 14]. For laboratory electric ﬁelds this
interaction is much smaller than the interaction with a
molecular electric dipole moment, but it can be used to
focus atoms [8] or decelerate them [15].

FIG. 3: Equipotentials (truncated) in x and y of skew F
lenses. The actual electrode can be fabricated from any set
of equipotentials and, if dimensions are in mm, they match
lenses used in the examples in Section IV. A two-wire ﬁeld
lens (with multipole components: a1 = 1, a3 = −1, a5 =
1 . . .) is shown in (a). An optimized multipole lens (with
multipole strengths a1 = 1, a3 = −1, a5 = 0) is shown in (b).
The lens in (b) is designed to focus in the strong ﬁeld limit.

C. Force on the molecule due to an electric ﬁeld
gradient

The force on a polar molecule in the x or y direction
can now be calculated using Eq’s. (1, 7, and 8) with a
suitable expression for ∂W/∂E from section III A.

Non-linear forces, inside the focusing lenses, limit the
maximum beam size that one can transport without suf-
fering beam losses, emittance (size) growth, and beam
halo. Non-linear forces generally arise from higher-order
multipole components of the lens electrostatic potential.
Cylindrical electrodes, which are two-wire ﬁeld lenses
(with r0 = half-gap), shown in Fig. 3 (a), have long
been used to focus molecules in strong-ﬁeld seeking states
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. They contain multipoles of all odd or-
ders and of equal strengths ( a1 = 1, a3 = −1, a5 = 1 . . .).
As we will see below, its strong decapole ﬁeld (a5 = 1)
reduces the area of the lens over which the focusing is
linear (dynamic aperture). A beam transport line using
two-wire ﬁeld lenses will be limited to a smaller diameter
beam compared to a similar transport line using opti-
mized multipole lens such as the one shown in Fig. 3 (b).

To produce a larger linear region we try to limit the
multipole ﬁelds to those that are essential for the optics.
We include a dipole ﬁeld (a1) to give a non-zero ﬁeld on
axis, without which strong-ﬁeld seeking molecules defo-
cus in both transverse directions; a sextupole ﬁeld (a3)
to provide the linear focusing force (of order r1); and
a decapole ﬁeld (a5) to correct the non-linear forces (of
order r3) produced by the sextupole ﬁeld. We omit the
quadrupole ﬁeld (a2), because it bends the beam, and
we omit the octupole ﬁeld (a4), because it introduces
stronger non-linear forces (of order r2) than those of the
sextupole/decapole ﬁelds. All other multipole strengths
are set to zero. In a real lens, however, the electrodes
may be truncated equipotentials, with the consequence

FIG. 4: Contour plots of the force in the x direction (Fx),
on a molecule inside a lens, as a function of x and y position.
The lines are contours of equal Fx in arbitrary units. In this
example we use the large Stark eﬀect limit (W = −deE) and
r0 = 6 mm. (a) shows Fx for a two-wire ﬁeld lens. (b) shows
Fx, for an optimized multipole lens (a5 = 0). A lens that was
completely linear in Fx would have vertical contour lines with
uniform spacing.

that small residual higher order multipoles will remain.

Since the lens potentials, as deﬁned by Eqs. (4, 5), have
two free parameters, we chose a1 = 1, making E0 the
central ﬁeld and we choose |a3| = 1, making it easier to
compare the optimized multipole lens to a two-wire ﬁeld
lens. The remaining choice is the decapole ﬁeld strength
a5, which we use to optimize the lens optics. We do this
in two ways: ﬁrst by calculating, for speciﬁc molecules,
the forces Fx and Fy inside a lens and comparing their
linearity in x and y for diﬀerent a5, and second, in section
IV, by simulation of beams in model transport lines.

If we calculate the horizontal force, Fx on a molecule
whose potential energy is W = −deE (strong ﬁeld limit),
we ﬁnd that it is most linear on-axis (y = 0) for no de-
capole ﬁeld (a5 = 0). For this example, the constant-
force contours for Fx in the x, y plane are shown, for the
two wire ﬁeld lens, in Fig. 4 (a) and, for the zero-decapole
lens, in Fig. 4 (b). The zero decapole lens is seen to have
far better linearity than the two-wire ﬁeld lens. (This is
also true for Fy which is not shown here.) In a similar
way, we ﬁnd that the optimized multipole lens outper-
forms the two-wire ﬁeld lens in the low electric ﬁeld limit
(quadratic Stark eﬀect), where the most linear ﬁeld on
axis has a5 = − 1
2 .

For a molecule

in a strong-ﬁeld seeking state
(∂W/∂E < 0), the lens will focus in the x direction (F-
lens) for a3 < 0, and focus in the y direction (D-lens)
for a3 > 0. For a molecule in a weak-ﬁeld seeking state
(∂W/∂E > 0) the F and D directions are reversed. The
lenses can also be used to focus atoms (∂Wα/∂E = −αE)
in their ground states, are always strong-ﬁeld
which,
seeking.

The linear design optics will determine the lens focus-
ing strength K0. Then, the choice of scaling radius r0,
will give the required lens ﬁeld, E0, from Eq. (11). Small
r0 allows us to use low electric ﬁelds but, as seen from
Eq’s. (6, 8), large r0 is needed for increased linearity. The
value of r0 chosen will then depend on the maximum elec-
tric ﬁeld strength and the beam size to be transported.

For a realistic beam transport simulation, we assume a
beam of methyl ﬂuoride (CH3F), in the J = 0 rotational
state, having a longitudinal velocity vZ0 = 560 m/s.
(This is the approximate velocity of a beam produced
by seeding methyl ﬂuoride in an argon jet source with a
reservoir temperature of 300 K (See section IV G) . The
electric ﬁeld derivative of the potential energy (of the J =
0 state), is given by Eq. (3) with de = 6.25×10−30 J/V/m
(1.86 Debye) and rotational constant B = 1.76 × 10−23 J
(0.88 cm−1).

To study long distance transport, we model a FODO
lattice consisting of a sequence of identical F and D lenses
separated by drift spaces (O). Then, to study a complete
beam line, we add an upstream lens section, to match
the beam from the jet source into the FODO lattice, and
a downstream section for a ﬁnal focus of the beam (see
Fig. 2).

Real lenses have ﬁnite length, and the two-dimensional
ﬁelds inside become three-dimensional ﬁelds at the ends.
There are three eﬀects from this. First, the z-component
of the ﬁeld gradient aﬀects the transverse motion. This
will be small if the lens aperture is small compared to
the physical length of the lens.

Second, the lens ﬁeld acts over a distance that is dif-
ferent than the physical length of the electrodes because
of (extending) fringe ﬁelds at the ends. For linear design
optics we approximate the real lens by a lens of constant
central ﬁeld E0 over an eﬀective length, diﬀerent than
the physical length of the lens. The eﬀective length is
determined by integrating the actual central ﬁeld (found
by numerical calculation or measurement) through the
lens, including the ends, and dividing by E0.

Third, the z-component of the electric ﬁeld gradient,
present at the ends of the lens, has an eﬀect on the z-
component ( longitudinal) velocity. The non-relativistic
Hamiltonian (neglecting gravity) for a molecule of mass
m and total velocity v is: H = 1
2 mv2 + W . The Hamil-
tonian is conserved if the electric ﬁeld is static. Conse-
quently, a molecule in a strong-ﬁeld seeking (weak-ﬁeld
seeking) state will gain (lose) kinetic energy entering the
lens and then lose (gain) the same amount of kinetic en-
ergy upon exit [15, 16]. For the central (x = y = 0) tra-
jectory, the longitudinal velocity, vzE, of the molecule, in
the lens is:

where vz0 is the velocity of the molecule in the drift
spaces. For most thermal or jet-source molecules in lab-
oratory electric ﬁelds, the change in velocity is a small
eﬀect. (A beam of 560 m/s methyl ﬂuoride molecules in
the J = 0 state increases its velocity by 0.2 m/s upon
entering an electric ﬁeld of 10 MV/m.)

We chose a simple FODO lattice consisting of identical
FODO cells (see Section II). The optics of a FODO cell
starts in the center of an F lens (or D lens) and ends at
the center of the next F lens (or D lens). At the ends of
the FODO cell the beam is at a waist (deﬁned as zero

B. Example of methyl ﬂuoride

slope in the beam size) with a maximum size in one plane
and a minimum size in the other plane.

For this study, we use 10 cm-long F/D lenses, with scal-
ing length r0 = 6 mm, separated by 40 cm drift spaces,
giving a FODO cell length of 100 cm. This design leaves
80 % of the cell unﬁlled. It is economical to build, but
does not have as large an acceptance as designs that ﬁlled
more of the lattice (see section V).

In a FODO lattice the motion of a particle is peri-
odic in phase-space. The phase-advance measures how
far along the period it has proceeded from its initial start-
ing point. The transverse linear optics are characterized
by the phase advance in the FODO cell µc. For our cell
we choose µc = π/3 rad, for which all particles return
to their initial phase-space position after 6 FODO cells.
This speciﬁes a central ﬁeld of E0 = 3.23 MV/m, which
is not close to breakdown, as well as, a beam size that is
nearly the minimum possible.

D. Modeling beam transmission

1.

beam distribution in phase space

We take the molecular beam to be continuous (un-
bunched) and monoenergetic, in which case, it is com-
pletely speciﬁed by its density in the (x, x′, y, y′) phase
space (distribution function). The beam size in a trans-
port line depends, not on the density, but on the four-
dimensional volume (V4D) occupied by the beam. This
can be deﬁned, experimentally, in a number of ways: (a)
the volume containing some fraction of the beam, (b)
the volume calculated from the root-mean-square (rms)
beam sizes, or (c) the volume deﬁned by a set of col-
limators. These four dimensional volumes can be re-
lated to an equivalent theoretical distribution function
of Kapchinsky and Vladiminsky (KV) [17]. With the
KV distribution function, we can calculate the linear fo-
cusing beam sizes (ax, ay) along the beam transport line
and, in so doing, model the design optics.

The KV distribution consists of a uniform density of
particles on a hyper-ellipsoid in four-dimensional phase
space. At a beam waist (a′′
y = 0), the hyper-
ellipsoid is given by:

x = a′′

(minimum or maximum).

The beam sizes along the beam transport line are given
by the uncoupled envelope equations, which for the equa-
tions of motion [Eq. (10)] are:

where ǫKV x and ǫKV y are the invariant transverse emit-
tances which, at a waist [see Eq. (12)], are simply given
by ǫKV x = axax′ and ǫKV y = ayay′.

If we project the KV distribution onto the (x, x′) plane,
we obtain a uniform density of particles inside an ellipse
of constant area πǫKvx. For an arbitrary beam distri-
bution, the equations of motion, for the rms beam sizes,
have the same form as Eq. (12). This deﬁnes the rms-
equivalent KV distribution sizes as ax = 2σx, ax′ = 2σx′,
ay = 2σy, and ay′ = 2σy′. Under linear forces, a molecule
remains on the same KV surface on which it started, with
the shape of the ellipse changing but its volume remain-
ing constant.

Since the non-linear forces inside a lens become
stronger, the further the molecule is from the central axis,
lenses may be evaluated by computing the increase in
non-linear eﬀects with increasing beam size. For this we
use nested KV distributions of increasing volume, each of
which is characterized by its volume, VKV . The simula-
tion results are then independent of the characteristics of
the initial beam and can be applied to non-surface beam
distributions.

2.

beam survival

We calculate the survival of a 560 m/s methyl ﬂuoride
beam in the J = 0 state, through a 30-m FODO lattice,
as a function of the decapole strength (a5). The lattice is
described in section IV C, and we assume that the beam
is already matched to the lattice. As molecular beam jet
sources are usually axi-symmetric, we take the emittance,
ǫKV to be the same in both transverse planes. Then, the
initial matched beam sizes and divergences, for the π/3
phase-advance FODO cell, are:

amax = ax = (ǫKV βmax)1/2
ax′ = (ǫKV βmax)1/2
ay = (ǫKV βmin)1/2
ay′ = (ǫKV βmin)1/2

where βmin = 0.587 m and βmax = 1.703 m. As β is in-
dependent of the emittance, we use the initial maximum
beam size, amax as our KV distribution size parameter :

VKV =

The relation between the beam size and the emittance is
shown in Fig. 5.

The trajectories were numerically integrated along the
FODO lattice using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm.
We take as lost those particles whose transverse displace-
ment, in the beam transport line, in x and/or y became
too large. The transported particles, which started on a

fuzzy one, producing emittance growth and halo.

From the simulations, we found the fraction of the ini-
tial methyl ﬂuoride beam surviving as a function of po-
sition along the beamline. We did this for two diﬀerent
lens designs (two-wire ﬁeld lens and optimized multipole)
and for selected initial KV beam sizes. The results are
shown in Figs. 6 (a) and 6 (b).

For the two-wire ﬁeld lens, the largest KV beam that
can be transmitted without loss is 1.4 mm. For the op-
timized multipole lens, the largest lossless KV beam is
2.5 mm. If the initial phase-space density of the beams
is approximately constant, the relative beam intensity is
given by the ratio of the lossless phase- space volumes.
This is a factor of (2.5/1.5)4 ≈ 10 improvement by using
the optimized multipole lenses in place of the two-wire
ﬁeld lenses in this FODO lattice.

Figures 6 (a) and 6 (b) also show that most of the beam
losses occur in the ﬁrst 5 m and by 30 m the losses are
essentially complete. This suggests that extending the
beam transport line to much longer distances will not
further reduce beam survival.

To ﬁnd the most appropriate values of the lens de-
capole strength,
for other molecules, we also studied
beam survival for the two limiting cases of strong elec-
tric ﬁeld (linear Stark eﬀect) and weak electric ﬁeld
(quadratic Stark eﬀect). A KV beam size of amax = 2.5
mm was used and the results, along with the results for
methyl ﬂuoride, are shown in Fig. 7.

For the strong ﬁeld limit, as well as for the methyl
ﬂuoride example, we obtain the highest transmission for
a5 = 0. In the weak electric ﬁeld limit the optimum value
of a5 is shifted to a5 ≈ −0.2, this nonlinearity in ∂E/∂x
compensating the nonlinearity in ∂W/∂E. Thus, an a5
near zero would be a good choice for CsF molecules in
low-lying rotational states, and an a5 near -0.2 would be
a good choice for ground-state atoms.

FIG. 6: Calculated beam survival for 560 m/s methyl ﬂuoride
in the J = 0 state in a 30 m-long FODO lattice constructed
of (a) two wire lenses or (b) optimized multipole lens with
a5 = 0. In each case r0 = 6 mm and the central ﬁeld, E0 =
3.2 MV/m. Survival is plotted as a function of (KV) beam
size. For the 100% beam survival, the beam intensity scales as
KV beam size to the fourth power (see text). Consequently,
the FODO lattice of optimized multipole lenses will transport
about a factor of ten more beam than the same FODO lattice
of two-wire ﬁeld lenses.

E. Velocity dependence of the beam transmission

So far we have considered only a monoenergetic beam.
To look at the tolerance of the diﬀerent lenses to en-
ergy deviations, we calculated the transmission for ini-
tially identical KV distributions but with diﬀerent ener-
gies (560 m/s being the matched velocity.)

The results are shown in Fig. 8, for KV beam size of
amax = 1.5 mm, for both the two-wire ﬁeld lens and
for the optimized multipole lens. Both do quite well. At
energies from 0.65 to 1.2 times the nominal energy of 640
K (velocity 560 m/s), transmission in the FODO lattice,
of two-wire ﬁeld lenses, is 50% or more of its maximum
value. The FODO lattice of optimized multipole lenses
does even better, as we would expect, since it has lossless
transmission up to a KV size of amax = 2.5. One should
note that Fig. 8 does not represent the energy acceptance
of a complete transport line, which will be limited by the

source and matching optics.

F. Beam matching and point focusing

We complete the model transport line by adding
matching optics upstream and downstream of the FODO
lattice. This matches the source to the lattice and the
lattice to the ﬁnal beam focus. The matching, in both
cases, is achieved using a doublet- and a triplet- lens con-
ﬁguration as shown in Fig. 2. As the matching lenses re-
quire stronger focusing, producing more non-linearities,
we raise the lens scaling length in the matching lenses to
r0 = 12 mm. And since most of the beam losses occur

8

early in the FODO lattice, we shorten the lattice to 15 m
to reduce the computing time necessary for the simula-
tion. The beam envelope, in x and y, and the placement
of the lenses, is shown in Fig. 9, for an initial beam which
is close to the linear focusing limit in the lenses.

For our example, of a 560 m/s beam of methyl ﬂuoride
in the J = 0 state, we assume that the jet source has a
very small oriﬁce and a skimmer, of 1.5 mm diameter,
is placed 25 cm upstream of the ﬁrst lens. An angular
spread of ± 3.3 mrad is ﬁxed by collimators (see Fig. 2).
This gives an initial beam emittance of 2.5 mm-mrad in
both transverse planes, and a maximum beam size of 2.1
mm in the FODO lattice. In addition, the initial beam is
taken to have a Gaussian energy spread of ± 10 % (rms).
The calculated beam transport, through this beamline,
is 84% of the entering beam, the losses being due to the
energy spread. Thus, we can transmit and focus most of
the velocity distribution from the jet source. (If needed,
the beam can be focused, at the end, to an even smaller
size. However in this case, we have to increase the size
of the beam in the doublet/triplet lenses, where the non-
linear forces will produce emittance growth and beam
halo. If we are not limited by the electric ﬁeld strength,
we can correct this by using lenses with a larger scaling
length.)

G. Transmitted intensity

If the characteristics of the initial molecular beam are
known, the transverse and longitudinal acceptances of
the full beam transport line may be used to calculate
the beam intensity at the ﬁnal focus. As an example,
consider the beamline in section IV F, which has a skim-
mer radius of 0.75 mm and an angular acceptance of
± 3.3 mrad. From the point of view of an observer at
the source, the entire beam transport line intercepts the
same solid angle as would a 2 mm diameter collimator,
located 0.3 m from the skimmer, with no lenses. The in-
tensity of an unfocused beam at this location can (often)
be calculated or measured. From this, and a knowledge
of the rotational state population fraction, and the ve-
locity spread, we can estimate the intensity at the ﬁnal
focus of the beamline.

For the methyl ﬂuoride example, we assume a (seeded)
jet source beam temperature of 3.5 K. (This is based
upon the equations in Ref. [18] for a 0.0035 cm diame-
ter source oriﬁce, a source pressure of 1.9 × 105 Pa (1400
torr) of Ar at a reservoir temperature of 300 K, and a
methyl ﬂuoride seed of 5%. The source could be either
pulsed or continuous.) The 3.5 K, results in a J = 0 pop-
ulation of about 30 %, based upon a Maxwell Boltzmann
distribution, and a kinetic energy spread of 11.4% which
implies a longitudinal acceptance of about 60 %.

Thus an intensity, equivalent to 18 % of a unfocused
methyl ﬂuoride beam passing through a 2 mm dia. col-
limator 0.3 m from the skimmer, would reach the ﬁ-
nal focus some 14.5 m from the source. And, since the

FIG. 9: Lens placement of a complete transport line with matching lenses and a 15-m FODO lattice (center line), and the
calculated rms beam envelope, in x and y, for 560 m/s beam of methyl ﬂuoride in the J = 0 state. We model the beam from a
skimmed jet source and focus it to a 2 mm diameter spot. A schematic of the beam transport line is shown in Fig. 2. With a
central ﬁeld of 3.2 MV/m, scaling lengths of r0 = 6 mm for the FODO lattice lenses, and 12 mm for the matching lenses, the
beam transport line has an acceptance of 2.5 mm - mrad in both transverse planes. The longitudinal acceptance is about 84%
for a ± 10 % rms energy spread.

beam transport line acceptances demonstrate transmis-
sion without loss, the same intensity should also reach a
ﬁnal focus much further from the source.

Finally, we note that much higher performance beam
transport lines can be designed. If one uses stronger elec-
tric ﬁelds, shorter FODO cells, ﬁlls more of the beamline
with focusing elements, and increases the size of the ﬁnal
focus, most of the solid angle from the skimmer can be
accepted. Similar measures would allow one to eﬃciently
transport and focus faster beams of molecules, such as
those seeded in a helium jet source.

V. APPLICATIONS

Improving alternating gradient transport and focusing
will make it easier to use molecules in strong-ﬁeld seek-
ing states for experiments, for beam transport, or to focus
molecules for easier detection. In beam resonance exper-
iments, molecules prepared in a strong-ﬁeld seeking state
can be detected, after a transition to a weak-ﬁeld seeking
state, as a ﬂop-in resonance.

The optimized multipole lenses can greatly reduce the
problem of Majorana transitions[19, 20]. These are tran-
sitions that arise because diﬀerent mJ levels belonging
to the same J are degenerate in zero ﬁeld. In very weak
electric ﬁelds, a time-varying component caused, for ex-
ample, by the motion of the molecule through the lens,
can induce a transition to a diﬀerent mJ state with a
very diﬀerent Stark eﬀect. This leads to beam loss, or
loss of signal and a large background in sensitive reso-
nance experiments.

The optimized multipole lenses reduce this problem by
allowing one to have all normal or all skew F and D lenses
with their central electric ﬁelds in the same direction.
This is done by changing the sign of a3, the hexapole
strength (and a5) while leaving the dipole strength (a1)

unchanged. Field direction changes in going between F
lenses and D lenses are eliminated.
If a weak dipole
(bias) ﬁeld is added to the region between the lenses,
the molecules may never be in a rapidly changing weak
electric ﬁeld.

The problem of Majorana transitions will be greatest
for molecules in weak-ﬁeld seeking states focused by pure
quadrupole and/or sextupole lenses. These lenses have a
vanishing ﬁeld at the center and rapid changes in the ﬁeld
direction at their entrances and exits [7]. The problem
will be diminished if the molecules are focused in alter-
nating gradient ﬁelds using optimized multipole lenses
with their central electric ﬁelds in the same direction
and with alternating positive and negative values of a3.
These lenses have a non-vanishing ﬁeld everywhere and
can be optimized for a quadratic Stark eﬀect by choosing
|a5| = −0.2. Again a small dipole bias ﬁeld can be used
between lenses.

The problem of Majorana transitions can be eliminated
by choosing the J = 0 state; which is non-degenerate,
always strong-ﬁeld seeking, has the largest Stark eﬀect
of any rotational level, and is highly populated in a cold
jet source beam.

The J = 0 and other strong-ﬁeld seeking states have
unique and useful properties that can be exploited in
experiments. Within a rotational level, J, the |mJ | = J
states are strong-ﬁeld seeking. States that are strong-
ﬁeld seeking in weak ﬁelds remain strong-ﬁeld seeking in
stronger ﬁelds (but weak-ﬁeld seeking states will become
strong-ﬁeld seeking in the limit of strong ﬁelds). Thus,
for strong ﬁeld seeking states, there is no restriction on
the size of the electric ﬁeld that can be used to focus
them. This is an advantage for molecules with small
rotational constants and large dipole moments, where the
weak ﬁeld-seeking states in low rotational levels become
strong-ﬁeld seeking in modest electric ﬁelds. CsF (Fig. 1)
and other heavy alkali halides are examples.

Long distance beam transport, which can exceed 100 m
or more, has a number of applications. Since monatomic
carrier gasses, clusters, and many contaminants will not
focus through the beam transport line, it can be used
to clean up a beam. For hazardous and radioactive
molecules, a long beamline allows one to separate the
source material and reservoir from the experiment and
allows one to use radioactive detection in a lower back-
ground environment.

The long transit time (54 ms for the 30 m beam line in
our example) corrected, if necessary for the small longi-
tudinal velocity changes in the focusing elements, can be
used for time-of-ﬂight measurements with pulsed sources
or a beam chopper. The diﬀerent velocities will focus
at slightly diﬀerent longitudinal positions, which may be
exploited for position-sensitive detection. Alternatively,
by using a pulsed beam and ramping the electric ﬁeld in
the (ﬁnal focus) lenses, all molecules may be brought to
a focus, at diﬀerent times, but at the same position.

The long ﬂight path may be useful for colinear laser
excitation of weak transitions. If the colinear laser ex-
citation is combined with time-of- ﬂight measurement,

10

the Doppler spread from the velocity distribution may
yield information about the absorption proﬁle. Long
transit time also allows for the decay of some long-lived
states. Molecular beams may be run in both directions to
form a very long colliding beam apparatus. In this case,
the reservoir temperatures of the beam sources may be
adjusted to equalize the focusing strengths of diﬀerent
molecules.

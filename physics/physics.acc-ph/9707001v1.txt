Abstract

Using the silicon strip detector of the CLEO experiment operating at the
Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring (CESR), we have observed that the
horizontal size of the luminous region decreases in the presence of the beam-
beam interaction from what is expected without the beam-beam interaction.
The dependence on the bunch current agrees with the prediction of the dy-
namic beta eﬀect. This is the ﬁrst direct observation of the eﬀect.

In a high energy colliding beam storage ring when two beams of oppositely charged
particles pass through each other there is an attractive force between them. Under certain
circumstances this beam-beam interaction can lead to a reduction in the transverse beam
size at the interaction point. This “dynamic beta” eﬀect is potentially important since a
smaller beam size corresponds to a higher luminosity.

The dynamic beta eﬀect has been long predicted [1].

It has been observed indirectly
through its eﬀect on luminosity at CESR [2]. This letter describes the ﬁrst direct observation
of the reduction in beam size due to the eﬀect. The dynamic beta eﬀect is analyzed by
modeling the beam-beam interaction as a linear focusing lens. This focusing alters the beta,
β, around the ring.
If the tune is just above the half integer resonance there is a sharp
reduction in β∗, the beta at the interaction point. This decreases the size of a single beam
at the interaction point, given by σ∗ = √β∗ǫ where ǫ is the emittance. The strength of
the linear lens and therefore the reduction in β∗ becomes larger with increases in the bunch
current.

CESR [3] is a particularly good place to observe the dynamic beta eﬀect. The bunch
current is large, over 8mA, generating a large beam-beam interaction. There is also a large
range of bunch currents during normal CESR operations as the beam lifetime is about three
hours and the typical ﬁll lasts 75 minutes. The collisions studied here have bunch currents
ranging from 4 to 8mA. In the horizontal direction the CESR lattice has a tune just above
the half integer contributing to a large dynamic beta eﬀect. In the vertical direction the
tune is not close to the half integer and thus bunch current dependent eﬀects are negligible
on the vertical size of the beam.

The CLEO detector has been described in detail elsewhere [4]. A recent addition is a
silicon strip vertex detector [5] which is crucial to the observation of the dynamic beta eﬀect.
This consists of three layers of silicon wafers arrayed in an octagonal geometry around the
interaction point. The ﬁrst measurement layer is at a radius of 2.3cm and the wafers are
read out on both sides by strips which are perpendicular to each other. The readout strips
have a pitch of about 100µm and with charge sharing the detector has an intrinsic per point
resolution of better than 20µm in both the plane transverse to the beam, the xy plane, and
in the direction parallel to the colliding beams, called z.

We observe the luminous region with events of the type e+e−

hadrons, which are
deﬁned as events with more than two charged tracks and four or more signiﬁcant energy
deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter. All the data are taken with electron-positron
collisions with a center of mass energy equal or just below the mass of the Υ(4S) resonance.
We try to form a vertex from all the tracks in the event that have hits in at least two of
the three layers of the silicon in both the xy-plane and z direction. Those tracks with a
contribution to the vertex chi-square of over two per degree of freedom are removed as being
unlikely to share a common vertex with the other tracks. This procedure is iterated until all
such tracks are removed. Finally the probability of the vertex chi-squared must be greater
than 10%. Vertices formed from two or more tracks give three dimensional points in space
that are used to determine the size of the luminous region. A total of 77327 such vertices
are found.

For each discrete ﬁll of CESR the average position is found in the vertical and horizontal
directions. There are occasional large shifts in this average ﬁll position that result from
tuning CESR for backgrounds or luminosity with the introduction of closed orbit distortions

through the interaction region. These ﬁll averages are subtracted from all the points of the
ﬁll to correct for these shifts in the average position of luminous region. We have looked for
changes in the average beam position during the course of a ﬁll and can discern none.

The distribution of these positions in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions is
binned and then ﬁt to a ﬂat function, to account for vertices not resulting from beam-beam
collisions, plus a Gaussian shape. The width of this Gaussian is taken as the observed width
of the luminous region.

Another useful feature of the CESR lattice for the observation of the dynamic beta eﬀect
is the disparity of the beam size between the horizontal and vertical directions. Without
considering the eﬀect of the beam-beam interaction, the horizontal beta at the interaction

Figure 1 shows the observed width of the luminous region in the horizontal and vertical
directions as a function of the bunch current. The vertical width of around 120µm is much
larger than the expectation of 10/√2 = 7µm. Studies with a Monte Carlo based simulation of
hadronic events in the CLEO detector indicate that the vertical width of the luminous region
is a measure of the technique’s resolution in the xy-plane. The observed horizontal width is as
small as 320µm which is smaller than the expected unperturbed value of 525/√2 = 370µm.
If the observed vertical width is interpreted as the resolution these data imply an underlying
horizontal width of the luminous region of σxL = 295µm which is much below the expected
unperturbed value.
If we ﬁt the observed widths as a function of the bunch current to
lines, the vertical is seen to be independent of the bunch current, while the horizontal width

interaction and a signiﬁcant dependence of the horizontal width on the bunch current are
evidence of the dynamic beta eﬀect.

To compare with the prediction of the dynamic beta eﬀect we extract the horizontal

beta from the width of the luminous region. We use a resolution of 118
from a ﬁt to the vertical distribution independent of bunch current with the error dominated
by a 10µm jitter introduced by the correction for the average ﬁll position. The horizontal
emittance is taken from the expectation of the CESR lattice. It is parametrized by ǫx =

The theory curves shown in Figure 2 also include the small eﬀect of the beam-beam
interaction at parasitic crossings away from the interaction point where the beams are sep-
arated by a pretzel orbit. This eﬀect serves to lower β∗
x by about a 10% at a bunch current
of 12mA and is essentially linear from no eﬀect at zero bunch current. The range of the

from ﬁll to ﬁll.

In conclusion, we have directly observed the dynamic beta eﬀect at CESR with the
silicon strip detector of the CLEO experiment. We have seen that the horizontal size of the
luminous region is smaller than expected when there is a beam-beam interaction, and that
it decreases in size with increasing bunch current as the dynamic beta eﬀect predicts. When
we extract the horizontal beta as a function of the bunch current it is seen to agree very
well with the expectation of the dynamic beta eﬀect. This is the ﬁrst direct observation of
this eﬀect.

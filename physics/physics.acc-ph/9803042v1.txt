The traditional approach to accelerator optics, based mainly on clas-
sical mechanics, is working excellently from the practical point of
view. However, from the point of view of curiosity, as well as with
a view to explore quantitatively the consequences of possible small
quantum corrections to the classical theory, a quantum mechanical
formalism of accelerator optics for the Dirac particle is being devel-
oped recently. Here, the essential features of such a quantum beam
optical formalism for any spin- 1
2 particle are reviewed. It seems that
the quantum corrections, particularly those due to the Heisenberg
uncertainty, could be important in understanding the nonlinear dy-
namics of accelerator beams.

Introduction

Why should one bother about a quantum mechanical treatment of accelerator
optics when the classical treatment works so well? This is a natural question
indeed. There is no prima facie reason at all to believe that a quantum me-
chanical treatment would be necessary to deal with any aspect of accelerator
optics design. As has been rightly pointed out [1], primary eﬀects in conven-
tional accelerators are essentially classical since the de Broglie wavelength of the
high energy beam particle is much too small compared to the typical apertures
and the energy radiated is typically low and of long wavelength. However, it is
being slowly recognized that quantum eﬀects are still important due to demands
on high precision in accelerator performance and ever increasing demands for
higher beam energy, luminosity and brightness [1]. Also, there is a growing
feeling now that a complete picture of spin polarization can only be obtained
on the basis of coupled spin
orbit phase-space transport equations (with and
without radiation) and to include all the subtleties of radiation one has to begin
with quantum mechanics since classical white noise models simply would not
suﬃce for all situations [2]. I like to add:

After all, accelerator beam is a quantum mechanical system and one may
be curious to know how its classical behavior can be understood, in detail,
from a quantum mechanical formalism based on the appropriate relativis-
tic wave equation.

As has been revealed by recent studies [3] the passage from quantum the-
ory to classical theory is not a simple aﬀair, particularly when the system
is a complicated nonlinear dynamical system with regular and chaotic re-
gions in its phase-space. Since accelerator beams are such systems [4]
it is time that the quantum mechanics of accelerator optics is looked at
seriously.

Essentially from the point of view of curiosity, the axially symmetric mag-
netic lens was ﬁrst studied [5] based completely on the Dirac equation. Later
works [6, 7] led to further insights into the quantum mechanics of spin- 1
2 particle
beam optics. Quantum mechanics of the Klein-Gordon (spin-0) and nonrela-
tivistic Schr¨odinger charged-particle beams were also studied [7, 8]. These works
dealt essentially with aspects of ion optics and electron optical imaging (for an
excellent survey of scalar electron wave optics see the third volume of the en-
cyclopaedic three-volume text book of Hawkes & Kasper [9]; this contains also
references to earlier works on the use of the Dirac equation in electron wave
optics problems like diﬀraction, to take into account the spinor nature of the
electron).

In the context of accelerator physics also, like in the case of electron and
ion beam optical device technologies, the practice of design of beam optical
elements is based mainly on classical physics. As is well known, various aspects

2

of accelerator beam dynamics like orbital motion, spin evolution and beam
polarization, radiation and quantum ﬂuctuations of trajectories, are analyzed
piecewise using classical, semiclassical, or quantum theories, or a mixture of
them, depending on the situation treated. Quantum mechanical implications
for low energy polarized (anti)proton beams in a spin-splitter device, using the
transverse Stern-Gerlach (SG) kicks, have been analyzed [10] on the basis of
nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation.

↔

To obtain the coupled spin

phase-space transport equations, for the spin- 1
2
particle, one needs an appropriate quantum Hamiltonian. Such a Hamiltonian
was stated, as following from the systematic Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) trans-
formation technique [11], by Derbenev and Kondratenko [12] in 1973 as the
starting point of their radiation calculations but no explicit construction was
given (such a Hamiltonian can also be justiﬁed [13] using the Pauli reduction
of the Dirac theory). The Derbenev-Kondratenko (DK) Hamiltonian has been
used [14] to construct a completely classical approach to beam optics, including
spin components as classical variables. Now, a detailed derivation of the DK
Hamiltonian has been given [2] and a completely quantum mechanical formalism
is being developed [2] in terms of the ‘machine coordinates’ and ‘observables’,
suitable for treating the physics of spin- 1
2 polarized beams from the point of
view of machine design.

Independent of the DK formalism, recently [15, 16] we have made a beginning
in the application of the formalism of the Dirac spinor beam optics, developed
earlier ([5]-[7]) mostly with reference to electron microscopy, to accelerator optics
to understand in a uniﬁed way the orbital motion, SG kicks, and the Thomas-
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi (TBMT) spin evolution. Here, I present the essential
features of our work, done so far, on the quantum beam optical approach to
accelerator optics of spin- 1

2 particles based on the Dirac equation.

2 Quantum beam optics of the Dirac particle

Our formalism of quantum beam optics of the Dirac particle, in the context of ac-
celerators, is only in the beginning stages of development. So, naturally there are
several simplifying assumptions: We deal only with the single particle dynam-
ics, based on the single particle interpretation of the Dirac equation, ignoring all
the inter-particle interactions and statistical aspects. Only monoenergetic beam
is considered. The treatment is at the level of paraxial approximation, so far,
though the general framework of the theory is such that extension to the case
of nonparaxial (nonlinear) systems is straightforward. Only time-independent
magnetic optical elements with straight axis are considered. Electromagnetic
ﬁeld is treated as classical. And, radiation is ignored.

Thus, we are dealing with elastic scattering of the particles of a monoen-
ergetic beam by an optical element with a straight axis along the z-direction
and comprising a static magnetic ﬁeld B = curl A. Hence, the 4-component

3

spinor wavefunction of the beam particle can be assumed to be of the form
Ψ(r, t) = ψ(r) exp(
iEt/¯h), where E is the total (positive) energy of the parti-
cle of mass m, charge q, and anomalous magnetic moment µa. The spatial part
of the wavefunction ψ(r) has to obey the time-independent Dirac equation

The signiﬁcance of the transformation in Eq. (6) is that for a paraxial beam
propagating in the forward (+z) direction ψ′ is such that its lower pair of com-
ponents are very small compared to the upper pair of components, exactly like
for a positive energy nonrelativistic Dirac spinor. Note the perfect analogy:

Let us recall that the FW transformation technique [11, 17] is the most
systematic way of analyzing the standard Dirac equation as a sum of the non-
relativistic part and a series of relativistic correction terms. So, the application
of an analogous technique to Eq. (7) should help us analyze it as a sum of the
paraxial part and a series of nonparaxial correction terms. To this end, we
deﬁne the FW-like transformation

It should also be mentioned that these FW-like transformations preserve the
property of ψ′ that its upper pair of components are large compared to the
lower pair of components. We shall stop with the above ﬁrst step which would
correspond to the paraxial, or the ﬁrst order, approximation.

Since the lower pair of components of ψ1 are almost vanishing compared to
H1 is negligible compared to
its upper pair of components and the odd part of
its even part, up to the ﬁrst order approximation we are considering, we can
eﬀectively introduce a two-component spinor formalism based on the represen-
tation of Eq. (10). Naming the two-component spinor comprising the upper

Up to now, all observables, ﬁeld components, etc., are deﬁned with reference
to the laboratory frame. But, as is usual in accelerator physics, we have to
deﬁne spin with reference to the instantaneous rest frame of the particle while
keeping the other observables, ﬁeld components, etc., deﬁned with reference to
the laboratory frame. For this, we have to transform ψ′′ further to an ‘accel-
erator optics representation’, say, ψA = TAψ′′. The choice of TA is dictated by
the following consideration. Let the operator ˆO correspond to an observable O
in the Dirac representation (Eq. (2) or Eq. (3)). The operator corresponding to
O in the representation of Eq. (11) can be taken to be given by

Here, Bk and B⊥ are the components of B in the +z-direction (the predominant
direction of motion of the beam particles) and perpendicular to it, unlike in
the usual TBMT vector Ω in which the components Bk and B⊥ are deﬁned
with respect to the direction of the instantaneous velocity of the particle. The
quantum beam optical Hamiltonian
A is the beam optical version of the DK
Hamiltonian in the paraxial approximation. To get the higher order corrections,
in terms of ˆπ⊥/p and ¯h, we have to go beyond the ﬁrst FW-like transformation.
It must be noted that while the exact quantum beam optical Dirac Hamilto-
(see Eq. (3)) is nonhermitian the nonunitary FW-like transformation has
nian
projected out a hermitian
A (see Eq. (16)). Thus, for the particle that survives
the transport through the system, without getting scattered far away, ψA has
unitary evolution along the z-axis. Hence, we can normalize the two-component
AψA = 1. This normalization will
ψA, at any z, as
be conserved along the optic (z) axis. Then, for any observable O represented
by a hermitian operator ˆOA, in the accelerator optics representation (Eq. (16)),
we can deﬁne the average at the transverse plane at any z as

for the relevant set of observables, give the transfer maps for the quantum
averages (or their classical values `a la Ehrenfest) from the plane at z to the
plane at z′.
In the classical limit this relation (Eq. (19)) becomes the basis
for the Lie algebraic approach to classical beam optics [19]. The Lie algebraic
approach has been studied [20] in the context of spin transfer map also using
the classical formalism.

The main problem of accelerator optics is to know the transfer maps for
the quantum averages of the components of position, momentum, and the rest-
frame spin between transverse planes containing the optical elements. We have
already seen that the rest-frame spin is represented in the accelerator optics
representation by the Pauli spin matrices. Let us take that the observed posi-
tion of the Dirac particle corresponds to the mean position operator of the FW
theory [11] or what is same as the Newton-Wigner position operator [21]. Then,
one can show, using Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), that in the accelerator optics repre-
sentation the transverse position operator is given by r⊥ up to the ﬁrst order
approximation (details are given elsewhere [22]). For the transverse momentum
in free space the operator is ˆp⊥ in the accelerator optics representation.

Obviously we have obtained the well known classical transfer maps (matri-
ces) for the transverse phase-space coordinates, and more, i.e., the transverse
SG kicks [10, 23]. The longitudinal SG kick, which has been proposed [23] as a
better alternative to the transverse SG kicks for making a spin-splitter device
to produce polarized (anti)proton beams, can also be understood [15, 22] using
the present quantum beam optical formalism. The skew magnetic quadrupole
can also be analyzed [24] in the same way as here.

4 Conclusion

In summary, we have seen how one can obtain a fully quantum mechanical for-
malism of the accelerator beam optics for a spin- 1
2 particle, with anomalous
magnetic moment, starting ab initio from the Dirac-Pauli equation. This for-
malism leads naturally to a uniﬁed picture of orbital and spin dynamics taking
into account the eﬀects of the Lorentz force, the SG force and the TBMT equa-
tion for spin evolution. Only the lowest order (paraxial) approximation has
been considered in some detail, with an example. It is clear from the general
theory, presented brieﬂy here, that the approach is suitable for handling any
magnetic optical element with straight axis and computations can be carried
out to any order of accuracy by easily extending the order of approximation.
It should be emphasized that the present formalism is valid for all values of
design momentum p from the nonrelativistic case to the ultrarelativistic case.
The approximation scheme is based only on the fact that for a beam, consti-
tuted by particles moving predominantly in one direction, the transverse kinetic
momentum is very small compared to the longitudinal kinetic momentum.

We hope to address elsewhere [22] some of the issues related to the con-
struction of a more general theory overcoming the limitations of the present
formalism. With reference to the inclusion of multiparticle dynamics within the
present formalism, it might be proﬁtable to be guided by the so-called thermal
wave model which has been extensively developed [25] in recent years to account
for the classical collective behavior of a charged-particle beam, by associating
with the classical beam a quantum-like wavefunction obeying a Schr¨odinger-like
equation with the role of ¯h played by the beam emittance ε.

To conclude, let me emphasize the signiﬁcance of the quantum formalism
for beam optics. The following question has been raised: What are the uses
of quantum formalisms in beam physics? [1] Of course, as we have seen above,
we understand the quantum mechanics underlying the observed classical be-
havior of the beam: when the ¯h-dependent quantum corrections are worked out
through the higher order FW-like transformations it is found that they are really
negligible. In my opinion, quantum formalism of beam optics has more signif-
icant uses. To see this, let me cite the following cases: (1) Recently there is a
renewed interest [26] in the form of the force experienced by a spinning relativis-
tic particle in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. Such studies are particularly
important in evaluating the possible mechanisms of spin-splitter devices [23].
A thorough analysis based on general Poincar´e covariance, up to ﬁrst order in
spin, shows that classical spin-orbit systems can be characterized [27], at best,
by ﬁve phenomenological parameters. This just points to the fact that spin be-
ing essentially a quantum aspect one must eventually have a quantum formalism
to understand really the high energy polarized accelerator beams. (2) A look
at Eq. (17) shows that the form of the transfer map for the quantum averages
of observables will diﬀer from the form of the corresponding classical maps by
= 0; the diﬀerences are
terms of the type

essentially due to the quantum uncertainties associated with ψA at the initial zi.
For example, a term like x3 in a classical map will become in the corresponding

ish even on the axis (where
mechanics modiﬁes the coeﬃcients of the various linear and nonlinear terms in
the classical map making them dependent on the quantum uncertainties asso-
ciated with the wavefunction of the input beam; actually, even terms absent in
the classical map will be generated in this manner with coeﬃcients dependent
on the quantum uncertainties as a result of modiﬁcations of the other terms (a
related idea of fuzzy classical mechanics, or fuzzy quantum evolution equations,
occurs in a diﬀerent context [28]). This quantum eﬀect could be signiﬁcant in
the nonlinear dynamics of accelerator beams. This eﬀect is relevant for spin dy-
namics too. For example, it is seen in Eq. (21) that the spin transfer map is not
linear in its components, in principle, even in the lowest order approximation,

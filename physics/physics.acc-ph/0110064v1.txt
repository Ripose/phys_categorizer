Diﬀerent limitations on luminosity of linac-ring type colliders coming from beam dynamics issues
are considered for the examples of the ep options of the THERA and Linac⊗LHC proposals. It is
shown that L = 1.3 × 1031 for THERA and L = 2.7 × 1032 for Linac⊗LHC can be achieved for
round beams case. Corresponding sets of parameters are given with the explanations.

I. INTRODUCTION

During the last decades, linac-ring type colliders are widely discussed concerning two purposes:

1. High luminosity particle factories [1],
2. High energy lepton-hadron colliders [2].
In these colliders, there are a number of unsolved problems, because of unconventional structure with respect to
well studied ring-ring and linear colliders. There are a number of advantages which make linac-ring choice for ep
collider preferable. First of all, this is the most eﬀective way to reach TeV scale in ep collisions. Then, it is possible
to construct TeV scale γp colliders on their base [3]. In addition, linacs provide the possibility to obtain high degree
of polarization of electron and positron beams, etc.

Today, the THERA proposal with √s ∼ 1 TeV [4] is the most advanced one among the linac-ring type collider
LHC with √s ∼ 5 TeV [5] should be taken into account as the next step. In this study, we
proposals and Linac
investigate limitations on parameters of the THERA and Linac
LHC ep colliders coming from intra-beam scattering
(IBS), beam-beam tune shift, Laslett tune shift and beam beam kink instability. At this stage, we consider round
beams (both matched and unmatched beam sizes).

II. FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS ON THE LUMINOSITY

There are two most important collider parameters from physicist point of view, namely, center of mass energy and
luminosity. In addition, beam polarization, energy spread, collision frequency and luminosity per collision could be
important in some cases. Center of mass energy is given by √s = 2
EeEp for ultrarelativistic colliding particles.
The expression for luminosity is

where Ne is number of electrons per bunch, Np is number of protons per bunch, σx,y are horizontal and vertical beam
sizes and fc is collision frequency. For linac-ring colliders fc = nbfrep, where nb is the number of electron bunches in
pulse and frep is the pulse repetition rate. To obtain high luminosity, as far as possible high particle numbers and
suﬃciently small beam sizes are needed. In addition to this, while determining this parameters, one should consider
limitations on them. Main limitations for electron beam and proton beam parameters are explained below.

A. Limitations on the electron beam parameters

The ﬁrst restrictive limitation for electron beam is beam power

1. Beam power

Pe = NeEenbfrep

which determines the maximum value of Nefc in Eq. (1). Taking into account the acceleration eﬃciency accessible
value of Pe is several tens M W .

The maximum number of electrons per bunch is determined by the beam-beam tune shift limit of the proton beam

2. Beam-beam tune shift

where rp = 1.534
p is beta

10−18 m is the classical radius of proton , γp is the Lorentz factor of proton beam and β∗

0.003. This limit value can be a little bit larger for linac-ring type colliders.

B. Limitation on the proton beam parameters

1. Intra-beam scattering (IBS)

One of the most important limitations comes from intrabeam scattering. IBS growth rates in energy spread, in the

horizontal εx and vertical εy emittances are deﬁned as following [6]:

Remaining parameters are relative velocity β, energy factor γ and velocity of light c. Dx and Dy are dispersion
functions. Parameter d represents a cut oﬀ for the IBS force, which is taken equal to vertical beam size.

2. Beam-beam kink instability

A relative oﬀset between the heads of the proton and electron bunches causes to a beam-beam force, which deﬂects
electrons. Interaction between deﬂected electrons and the tail of the proton bunch causes beam-beam kick, which can
drive proton beam unstable. A stability criterion under linear approximation is [7,8],

where De is disruption parameter and νs is the synchrotron tune of the proton beam,

Luminosity of ep collisions is constrained also by Laslett tune-shift, which leads to upper limit on the ratio Np/εN
p
≈ 1017. However,
at injector stage. For operating proton rings (HERA, Tevatron) and LHC injector systems Np/εN
p
this limit can be overcame by a several methods; namely, higher injection energy in the booster, smaller booster ring,
appropriate cooling of the proton beam, etc. For example, increasing of DESY III energy from 50 MeV to 120 MeV

THERA parameters given in TESLA TDR [10] are shown in the ﬁrst column of Table I. The second column
shows how to improve IBS rates for the matched electron and proton beam sizes without changing Np/εN
p value. The
third column deals with unmatched beam sizes, in which upper limit on luminosity is imposed by beam-beam tune
10−4 and we have used this value to
shift and beam beam kink instability. Synchrotron tune for HERA is 5.12
estimate upper limit imposed by beam-beam kink instability. The fourth column gives a possible limit on luminosity
improvement by changing injector Laslett tune shift limit with various methods mentioned above.
In this case,
IBS growth time becomes main limiting factor for matched beams, whereas beam-beam kink instability limits the
luminosity for unmatched beam case, as seen from the ﬁfth column of the Table I. Table I shows that in the case of
1031 cm−2s−1can be

1031 cm−2s−1 seems realistic for THERA and luminosity L = 1.3

In this case, following [5] (see also R. Brinkmann et al.

in [2]) we consider TESLA-like accelerator as a ”linac”.
A possible use of CLIC as a ”linac” requires separate consideration, because of unmatched bunch spacing for CLIC

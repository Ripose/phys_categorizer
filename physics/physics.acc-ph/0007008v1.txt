Abstract

This paper studies the possibility of using the survival function, to predict
long term stability by extrapolation. The survival function is a function of
the initial coordinates and is the number of turns a particle will survive for a
given set of initial coordinates. To determine the diﬃculties in extrapolating
the survival function, tracking studies were done to compute the survival
function. The survival function was found to have two properties that may
cause diﬃculties in extrapolating the survival function. One is the existence
of rapid oscillations, and the second is the existence of plateaus.
It was
found that it appears possible to extrapolate the survival function to estimate
long term stability by taking the two diﬃculties into account. A model
is proposed which pictures the survival function to be a series of plateaus
with rapid oscillations superimposed on the plateaus. The tracking studies
give results for the widths of these plateaus and for the seperation between
adjacent plateaus which can be used to extrapolate and estimate the location
of plateaus that indicate survival for longer times than can be found by
tracking.

Introduction

This paper studies the possibility of using the survival function, to predict
long term stability by extrapolation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The survival func-
tion is a function of the initial coordinates and is the number of turns a
particle will survive for a given set of initial coordinates. To determine the
diﬃculties in extrapolating the survival function, tracking studies were done
to compute the survival function. The survival function was found to have
two properties that may cause diﬃculties in extrapolating the survival turns
function. One is the existence of rapid oscillations, and the second is the
existence of plateaus.It was found that it appears possible to extrapolate the
survival function to estimate long term stability by taking the two diﬃculties
into account.

A model is proposed which pictures the survival function to be a series of
plateaus with rapid oscillations superimposed on the plateaus. The tracking
studies give results for the widths of these plateaus and for the seperation
between adjacent plateaus which can be used to extrapolate and estimate
the location of plateaus that indicate survival for longer times than can be
found by tracking.

The survival function, jtrns.

For a given set of initial coordinate, x0, px0, y0, py0, one can ﬁnd by tracking
the survival time in turns, which is the number of turns the particle will
survive before becoming unstable and which will be denoted by jtrns. This
determines the function jtrns(x0, px0, y0, py0) which will be called the survival
function [8, 9, 10, 11]. If one limits the tracking to 1.0 106 turns or less, one
can ﬁnd jtrns for those x0, px0, y0, py0 for which jtrns is less than or equal to
1.0 106.

A tracking study was done of particle motion with no rf present, using
an older version of the RHIC lattice. Random and systematic ﬁeld error
multipoles are present up to order 10. The particle momemtum is dp/p = 0.
As the ﬁrst case studied, the initial coordinates x0, px0, y0, py0 are chosen
along the direction in phase space given by px0 = 0, py0 = 0 and ǫx0 = ǫy0,
where ǫx0, ǫy0 are the linear emittances in the absence of the error multipoles.
Along this direction in phase space , jtrns may be considered to be a function
of x0. For a given initial coordinate, x0, one can ﬁnd by tracking the survival
time in turns, which is the number of turns the particle will survive before
becoming unstable and will be denoted by jtrns. This determines the survival
function [8, 9, 10, 11] jtrns(x0). If one limits the tracking to 1 106 turns or
less, one can ﬁnd jtrns for those x0 for which jtrns is less than or equal to
1 106. For dp/p = 0, it is assumed that on the closed orbit x = 0 and x0 is
also the initial betatron oscillation amplitude.

The tracking was ﬁrst done using x0 which are seperated by dx0 = .1
mm. The results for jtrns versus x0 are shown in Fig. 2.1. The results in this
ﬁgure may be looked at as the results of a search in x0 starting at large x0
and decreasing x0 in steps of dx0 = .1mm . The ﬁgure shows an apparent

stability limit for 1e6 turns of usl =15.2 mm.

2.1 Rapid oscillations in the survival function

Fig. 2.1 shows rapid oscillations in jtrns with x0. Large changes in jtrns
occur when x0 changes by .1 mm. The oscillations extend over about .3
mm. Tracking studies show that the oscillations become more rapid when
the search interval, dx0, is decreased. This is indicated in Fig. 2.2 where dx0
is decreased to .05 mm and in Fig. 2.3 where dx0 is decreased to .025 mm.
Results for diﬀerent search intervals, dx0, are shown in Table 2.1. dx0 is
decreased from .1mm to .0001 mm . The wavelength of the oscilations , ∆x0,
as measured from the stability limit for 1e6 turns, usl, to the location of the
ﬁrst peak in jtrns decreases from about .3 mm to .0002 mm. Also listed for
each value of dx0 are the apparent stability limit for 1e6 turns, usl, and jtrns

at usl + dx0.

Table 2.1 shows that the wavelength of the oscilations , ∆x0 is roughly
proportional to the size of the search interval, dx0. The value of jtrns at
usl + dx0 shows that near usl, jtrns changes appreciably in the small change
in x0 given by dx0. Tracking results show that this seems to hold even at
extremely small dx0.The computed results appear to indicate that jtrns(x0)
is not a continuous function of x0. For a continuous function of x0, one can
ﬁnd a small enough interval in x0 such that the diﬀernce between the values
of the function for any two x0 in that interval is very small. This does not
appear to be true for jtrns(x0).

The existence of the rapid oscillations in the survival function, jtrns(x0),
would seem to make it diﬃcult to extrapolate to ﬁnd those x0 that sur-
vive for more than 1e6 turns. However one could view the survival function
shown in Fig. 2.1 as being made up of the rapid oscillations superimposed
on a smoother, more slowly varying function which could be used for the
extrapolation. This is discussed further in section 2.3.

2.2 Plateaus in the survival function

Looking at Fig. 2.1, one can make out plateaus in the survival function,
jtrns(x0). The plateaus are regions where jtrns oscillates rapidly around an
almost constant value of jtrns. The plateaus can be seen somewhat more
clearly if one reduces the search interval dx0, as shown in Fig. 2.2 where dx0
is decreased to dx0 = .05mm. One can make out 4 plateaus located at about
jtrns=1.5e5, 2e4, 3500, 400 turns. Possible plateaus with jtrns less than 100

turns are being ignored. It will be seen that the width of the plateaus do not
depend on the search interval, dx0. This is also true of the location of the
plateaus in jtrns. This is shown in Fig. 2.3 where dx0=.025 mm.

The existence of the plateaus in the survival function, jtrns(x0), would
seem to make it diﬃcult to extrapolate to ﬁnd those x0 that survive for more
than 1e6 turns. If one does the extrapolation using points which are close to
the stability limit for 1e6 turns, usl, one may get incorrect results as these
points may lie on one of the plateaus.

2.3 Extrapolation of the survival function

The data given above leads to a model of the survival functioon, which
pictures it as sequence of plateaus. Within the plateaus, jtrns oscillates about
some constant vaue of jtrns which will be called the level of the plateau. The

existence of the plateaus makes extrapolation of the survival function appear
diﬃcult. The last plateau that was measured has a level of about 1.5e5 turns
and a width of about 1.2 mm. An interesting question is what is the level of
the next plateau, at lower x0, after the last plateau that was measured. In
the following this plateau will be referred to as the ’next plateau’.

Some help with the extrapolation is also provided by plotting 1/Log(jtrns)
against x0 as shown in Fig. 2.4, where the search interval is dx0=.1mm and
points with jtrns less than 400 turns are omitted.
It will be seen below
that the seperation between adjacent plateaus does not vary greatly when
measured as the change in 1/Log(jtrns).

To help locate the ’next plateau’, long runs were done starting with
x0=15.2mm, and decreasing x0 1n steps of .1mm.
In order to detect the
beginning of the ’next plateau’, the runs have to be long enough not to be
confused by the rapid oscillations in jtrns that occur within each plateau.
Runs of length 2e7 turns were chosen, and these runs take about 10 days for

the RHIC lattice used.

The results are shown in Fig. 2.5 . One sees from this ﬁgure that the ’next
plateau’ appears to start at x0=15.3 mm and ends at about 14.0 mm, and
has a level of about jtrns=15e6 turns and a width of 1.2mm . The previous
plateau goes from 16.5mm to 15.2 mm and has a width of 1.3mm and a level
of jtrns=1.5e5 turns. The width of the plateau is measured here from the
end of one plateau in x0 to the end of the adjacent plateau and includes the
transition region where the points move from one plateau to the next. The
width of the ’next plateau’ is diﬃcult to measure, as the adjacent plateau at
still lower x0 is estimated to have a level of 3e9 turns, and cannot be found
by tracking. One can see that the width is larger than 1.2mm. The x0 at 14.0
mm survived more than 89.9e6 turns. The data given above for the ’next
plateau’ is somewhat in error but it seems better to use it than to throw
away this information.

The results are also shown as a 1/Log(jtrns) versus x0 plot in Fig. 2.6.

One can see three plateaus near the stability boundary at the levels of about
jtrns= 15e6, 1.5e5,and 2e4 turns. The properties of the plateaus are summa-
rized in Table 2.2. The seperation between the plateaus in the 1/Log(jtrns)
plot are given by .054 and .039, so that the seperation between the plateaus
in the 1/Log(jtrns) are not too diﬀerent. The widths of the plateaus that
were measured were 1.2+, 1.3 and 1.7 mm.

The plateau model will now be used to extrapolate and investigate long
term stability in RHIC. In RHIC, jtrns=1e9 turns coresponds to a survival

time of about 3.5 hours. The data given above will be used to extrapolate
to ﬁnd the plateau whose level is greater than or equal to jtrns=1e9 turns.
This plateau will be called the 1e9 plateau. The existence of the plateaus
indicates that there are limits on the accuracy one can hope to achieve by
extrapolation. The two parameters one needs to extrapolate the survival
function are the plateau width and the plateau level seperation. One cannot
be certain what these parameters will be at jtrns of the order of 1e9 turns.
However, one can use the data found for these two parameters at jtrns of the
order of 1e6 turns , to make the best estimate for these parameters at jtrns
of the order of 1e9 turns.

The plateau width and the plateau level seperation were studied for three
diﬀerent cases coresponding to three diﬀerent directions in phase space. The
results are summarized in chapter 5. The widths of the plateaus were found
to be roughly constant when measured in terms of X0=[βx0(ǫx0 + ǫy0)].5 with

an average value ∆X0=2.00 mm. The plateau level seperation measured in
1/Log(jtrns) varied from .054 to .019 with an average value of .033. It is sug-
gested that in the extrapolation, the average value of these two parameters
be used. For the case being considered here, it is assumed in the extrap-
olation that the plateau widths in x0 will be 1.4 mm corresponding to the
average value of ∆X0=2.00 mm, and the plateau level seperation is .033 in
1/Log(jtrns). Note that in this case X0=1.414 x0

The results found using these assumptions are shown in Fig. 2.7, where
two new plateaus are shown that were found by extrapolation. The plateau
just below the next plateau in x0 has the level of jtrns=3.3e9 turns and is
the 1e9 plateau in this example. The 1e9 plateau goes from x0=13.9mm to
x0=12.6mm. The aperture for 1e9 turns may be taken as about 13.9mm,
which may be compared to the 15.2 mm found using runs of 1e6 turns. This
indicates a loss of about 1.3mm or about 9% due to the required survival

CHAPTER 2. THE SURVIVAL FUNCTION, JT RN S .

time of 1e9 turns. One may note that the level of the 1e9 plateau being 3.3e9
turns, one may expect that some of the x0 on this plateau will not survive
1e9 turns due to the oscillations in jtrns that will occur on this plateau.To
be safer one could assume the aperture for 1e9 turns to be 12.6 mm, which
is the beginning of the adjacent plateau with a level of 1.2e14 turns, giving
a loss of 17%.

The procedure used indicates that in this case the result is not sensi-
tive to changes in the two assumptions made regarding the width and level
seperation of the plateaus. If the plateau model continues to hold for the
extrapolated plateaus, and the width and level seperation remain roughly
1.3 mm and .034 respectively, then the result for the aperture for 1e9 turns
will be about the same.

The plateau model developed above avoids certain problems that arise in
tracking studies. In trying to ﬁnd the aperture for the survival time of 1e9
turns, the more usual approach is to try ﬁnd the x0 such that all smaller x0
will survive for 1e9 turns. If while doing a tracking search starting from large
x0, one ﬁnds a x0 that survives for 1e9 turn, then one has to ask whether all
smaller x0 will survive for 1e9 turns. This is a diﬃcult question to answer.
It is even possible, that there are are always smaller x0 that will not survive
1e9 turns, although these x0 may become very scarce at smaller x0. In the
plateau model, in trying to ﬁnd the aperture for the survival time of 1e9
turns, the approach is to try to ﬁnd the plateau whose level is greater than
1e9 turns. This is a better deﬁned target, and the expectation is that this
plateau will indicate a region of x0 where most x0 will survive 1e9 turns.

The tracking results presented above were all done along the ǫx0 = ǫy0
direction. Results will now be given for the y0 = 0, py0 = 0 or ǫy0 = 0
direction. Tracking studies of other cases will test the consistancy of the
plateau model. The direction in the space of x0, px0, y0, py0 is further deﬁned
by px0 = 0. The particle motion is 4 dimensional because of the presence
of skew multipoles.
jtrns may then be considered to be a function of x0.
Fig. 3.1 shows jtrns as a function of x0 as found with tracking runs of 1e6
turns. The apparent stability limit using 1e6 turns and dx0=.1mm is 22.0
mm. To make the plateaus more visible , one can reduce the search interval
dx0 to dx0=.05 mm. These results are shown in Fig. 3.2. One sees that there
are two plateaus in the region shown with jtrns greater than or equal to 1e4,
whose levels are located at jtrns= .9e6 , and 1e4 turns .The oscillations on
the plateau near the stability boundary, appear to be smaller than those seen
in the ǫx0 = ǫy0 case.

Runs of about 2e7 turns were done to ﬁnd the shape of the ’next plateau’

in the region where x0 is less than or equal to 21.0 mm. Enough tracking runs
were done to determine the beginning , and the level of the ’next plateau’.
The results are shown in Fig. 3.3. Including these longer runs , one sees that
the ’next plateau’ begins at x0=21.0mm and the level of the ’next plateau’
is about jtrns=8e6 turns. Here, the begining of the plateau is the edge at
larger x0 and the end is the edge at lower x0. Th end of the ’next plateau’
is some what diﬃcult to determine, as the adjacent plateau at lower x0 has
a high level of about 1e9 turns. The end of the ’ next plateau’ was taken to
be at x0=19.0 mm. The adjacent plateau at higher x0 is at the level of 1.5e6
turns and with the width of 1.8 mm. These two plateaus are seperated by
.017 in 1/Log(jtrns) which is smaller than the .054 found in the ǫx0=ǫy0 case.
The results are also shown as 1/Log(jtrns) versus x0 plot in Fig. 3.4.

The data found for these two plateaus will be used to extrapolate and
ﬁnd the 1e9 plateau in this case. In the extrapolation, the results found in
chapter 5 for the average plateau width and level seperation will be used. In

this case, this leads to the assumptions that each plateau is 2.0mm wide and
a plateau level seperation of .033 in 1/Log(jtrns) will be used here.

The results are shown in Fig. 3.5, where two extrapolated plateaus are
shown with the plateau levels 8.5e8, and 4.5e12 . The aperture for 1e9 turns
was taken to be 17.1mm, the beginning of the plateau with a level of 4.5e12
turns. 17.1 mm is to be compared with the aperture of 21.9 mm found with
runs of 1e6 turns. A loss of 4.8 mm or 22%.

Results will now be given for the x0 = 0, px0 = 0 or ǫx0 = 0 direction.In
order to be able to compare results with those of the above two cases, jtrns
will plotted against X0 = (βx0/βy0).5y0. Fig. 4.1 shows jtrns as a function
of X0 as found with tracking runs of about 2e7 turns.The apparent stability
limit using 1e6 turns and dx0=.1mm is usl=24.9 mm. In Fig. 4.1 one can
make out two plateaus with levels larger than 1e4 turns. The levels of these
two plateaus are at 1.7e6 turns and 1.5e7 turns. The end of the 1.5e7 plateau
was taken as X0=21.4 mm. The results are also shown as a 1/Log(jtrns) plot
in Fig. 4.2.

The data found for these two plateaus will be used to extrapolate and
ﬁnd the 1e9 plateau in this case. In the extrapolation, the results found in
chapter 5 for the average plateau width and level seperation will be used. In
this case, this leads to the assumptions that each plateau is 2.0 mm wide and
a plateau level seperation of .033 in 1/Log(jtrns) will be used here.

on the 3.3e9 plateau will be assumed to survive 1e9 turns, and the aperture

of 24.9 mm found with runs of 1e6 turns. A loss of 3.5 mm or 17%.

The extrapolation depends on two parameters, the width of the plateaus
and the seperation between consecutive plateau levels as measured in terms
of 1/Log(jtrns). The behaviour of these two parameters was studied by do-
ing tracking runs for 3 diﬀerent cases, corresponding to the three diﬀerent
directions in phase space, ǫy0=0, ǫx0=ǫy0 and ǫx0=0. The two parameters
were measured for these 3 cases using runs of about 2e7 turns. The results
are summarized in Table 5.1. Altogether, 7 plateaus were found and the two
parameters for these 7 plateaus were measured. In Table 5.1 one sees that
the plateau width, as measured as ∆X0, X0 = (βx0(ǫx0 + ǫy0)).5, is relatively

constant with an average value of ∆X0=2.00 mm. The plateau level sepera-
tion when measured in 1/Log(jtrns) varies considerably with an average value
of .033.

Based on the above results, it is proposed that in extrapolating the sur-
vival function, it is assumed that the extrapolated plateau widths are given
by ∆X0=2.00 mm, and the plateau level seperations in 1/Log(jtrns) are .033.

Conclusions

Tracking studies lead to a model of the survival function, which pictures it
as sequence of plateaus. Within the plateaus, the survival time in turns,
jtrns, oscillates about some constant vaue of jtrns which will be called the
level of the plateau. Studying the survival function along diﬀerent directions
in phase space, using an older version of the RHIC lattice , one ﬁnds that
the width of the plateaus, ∆X0, X0 = (βx0(ǫx0 + ǫy0)).5, remains roughly
constant at about 2.00 mm. The seperation between the levels of adjacent
plateaus has the same order of magnitude when measured in terms of the
change in 1/Log(jtrns), and has an average vaue of .033. Using, these results
for the width of the plateaus and the seperation between plateau levels, one
can extrapolate to estimate the location of the plateaus that correspond to
longer survival times than can be found by tracking. For the case treated, it
was found that a required survival time of 1e9 turns reduced the aperture by
about 15% as compared to the aperture found by tracking using 1e6 turns.
The plateau model also leads to new criteria to be used in tracking studies
to ﬁnd the aperture for particles to survive a given number of turns. In the
plateau model, one ﬁnds the ﬁrst plateau whose level is higher than the given
number of turns, in order to ﬁnd the aperture for the given number of turns.
This is to be compared with often used method, where one does a search
starting at large amplitudes until one ﬁnds an amplitude that survives the
given number of turns. In the latter method one cannot be sure that a ﬁner
search would not ﬁnd unstable runs at smaller amplitudes or how frequently
these unstable runs will occur. In the plateau model, while there may be
unstable runs at smaller amplitudes, there is the assumption that they will
not occur frequently.

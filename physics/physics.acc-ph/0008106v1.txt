HIGH CURRENT BEAM DYNAMICS IN AN ESS SC LINAC

Abstract

Three alternative designs of
the European Spallation
Source (ESS) high energy linac are described. The most
promising ones are either a normalconducting (nc) coupled
cavity linac (CCL) up to ﬁnal energy or a change at 407
MeV to only one group of 6 cell superconducting (sc) el-
liptical cavities.

Fully 3d Monte Carlo simulations are presented for both
options, optimized for reduced halo formation at the linac
end. For the error free matched case, especially the halo
formation in the longitudinal plane is more pronounced
for the hybrid solution with its superconducting cavities,
caused by the unavoidable phase slippage, but still quite
well acceptable for loss free ring injection. Simulations
however for a 30% mismatched dense core, surrounded
in addition by 1.5% halo particles are showing few parti-
cles with very large amplitudes even in real space. This
case represents halo formation in front to end simulations,
caused by current ﬂuctuations, ﬁlamented RFQ output dis-
tribution and enhanced by accumulated ﬁeld errors.

1 OPTIONS FOR THE HIGH ENERGY
PART OF THE 6% D.C. ESS LINAC

The current reference design of the ESS contains a 1.334
GeV H − linac with a 5% duty cycle, a 50 Hz repetition rate
and a peak current of 114 mA. The beam current is chopped
with a 70% duty cycle [1]. The radio frequency is 280MHz
for the two front end RFQs and DTLs. After funneling at
20 MeV ﬁnal acceleration to 1.334 GeV is accomplished
in a nc CCDTL and CCL operating at 560 MHz. A sc ver-
sion of the high energy linac is also being studied. The 1
msec long linac pulse is injected into 2 compressor rings,
to produce a ﬁnal beam pulse length of 1 µsec.

Any design of the ESS high energy linac must ensure
loss free ring injection. This demands an unﬁlamented 6d
phase space distribution for the linac beam.

Table 1, lists 3 high energy, 6% duty cycle, linac design
options for a 107 mA, 60% chopped beam using 700 MHz
structures. These were the linac parameters from the ESS
study [2]. The 700 MHz linac frequency is also the same as
considered for the CONCERT [3] multi-user facility. The
following conclusions are valid for both 560 and 700 MHz
frequencies, but they are limited to linacs with about 6%
duty cycle.

For all three options, a doublet focusing system with
warm quadrupoles is assumed either after 2 nc cavities [2]
or after ( 2, 3, 4 ) 6-cell elliptical sc cavities. The acceler-
ating gradient is kept constant at EoT = 2.8 MV/m for the
nc cavities resp. Eo = ( 5 MV/m, 8.50 MV/m, 13.7 MV/m

) for the 3 sc cavities. Two power coupler/ cavity are as-
sumed for the β = 0.8 sc cavities. The synchronous phase
is kept constant at −25o in the nc cells, whereas only the sc
cavity midphase can be kept constant at −25o as a conse-
quence of phase slippage. All sc cavities are assumed to be
made out of 6 identical cells. The relative β dependence of
the transit time factor is the same as for the SNS 805 MHz
sc high β = 0.76 6-cell cavities [4], obtained from super-
ﬁsh calculations where end ﬁeld effects are included. The
average transit time factor is smaller by at least 10% than
the π/4 = 0.79 value of β = 1 sc elliptical cavites. The
average synchronous phase per cavity is smaller than −37o
at beginning resp. end of each sc section.
It is obvious from table 1, that a pure nc ESS linac ver-
sion from 105 MeV on is the cheapest in capital cost, but
not in operating cost. A sc ESS linac from 120 MeV on
requires much less peak RF power, but it is in capital cost
quite expensive and substantial R & D is necessary for the
50 Hz pulsed mode behaviour of β = 0.52 elliptical sc cav-
ities [5, 6], including the ESS 2.7 msec long pulse option

[2]. The hybrid solution with its two couplers/cavity is the
shortest and the cheapest one for capital plus 20 years op-
erating time cost. By having only one coupler/cavity the
ESS hybrid linac will be longer than the corresponding nc
one. Detailed pulsed power tests with 2 couplers/cavity are
foreseen for the 500 MHz, β = 0.75 sc cavity teststand
at FZ J¨ulich [7]. The open questions are halo formation at
the end of the ESS hybrid linac, resulting from the phase
slippage and enhanced by mismatch.

2 MULTIPARTICLE RESULTS FOR THE
ERROR FREE MATCHED ESS LINAC

In Fig. 1, 2 results from Monte Carlo simulations are
shown for the ESS nc linac at 105 MeV injection and at
the 1334 MeV ﬁnal energy. All simulations are done with
10000 fully in 3d interacting particles. The 700 MHz bunch
current is 107 mA, the normalized rms emittances are 0.3π
mm mrad resp. 0.4πoM eV . The ratio between the full and
zero current tune is greater than ( 0.6, 0.5 ) transversely
resp. longitudinally. The ratio between the transverse and
longitudinal temperature in the rest system is 0.66 at injec-
tion and about 1.3 at the linac end. All zero current tunes
are below 90o. The rms radii are about 3 mm at injection
resp. 2 mm at the ﬁnal energy.

The results in Fig. 1, 2 are obtained for the error free
matched case. The upper row corresponds to an 6d wa-
terbag input distribution limiting each particle coordinate
to √8 of its rms value. As the ESS high intensity nc linac is
designed to avoid all kind of instabilities, driven either by
high space charge, temperature anisoptropy or resonance
crossing [8], almost no halo formation is visible at the linac
end: there are no particles outside 20ǫrms at the linac end.
The rms emittances are changing by less than 10%.

Figure 2: Output distribution for the nc linac for matched
input. Upper row without, lower row with 1.5% initial halo

10ǫrms. About 1% halo particles above 10ǫrms are found
in simulations of the 2.5 MeV ESS RFQ [9]. Phase space
correlations between halo particles of a bunched beam in a
periodic focusing channel are reported before [8, 10]. At
the ESS nc linac end there are now about 10−3 particles
outside 20ǫrms, going up in phase space to about 40ǫrms.
But still all particles are limited to ±10 mm at the linac
end which is less than half of the assumed 22 mm aperture
radius. There are less than 10−3 particles outside ±1 MeV.
In Fig. 3 the output distributions are shown for the er-
ror free matched ESS hybrid linac. Again the upper row is
assuming an initial 6d waterbag distribution without halo,
whereas the lower row assumes a distribution with 1.5%
halo. For a constant transverse full current tune of 45o in
the sc cavity section the ratio between the full and zero
current tune is greater than ( 0.6 , 0.67 ) transversely resp.
longitudinally. The ratio between the transverse and longi-
tudinal temperature in the rest system is 0.36 at 407 MeV
and about 1.1 at the linac end. All zero current tunes are
below 90o. The rms radii are about 2 mm at 407 MeV resp.
1 mm at the ﬁnal energy.

Figure 3: Output distribution for the hybrid linac. Upper
row without, lower row with 1.5% initial halo

By comparing the nc output distribution in Fig. 2 with
the hybrid one in Fig. 3 much more halo formation espe-
cially in the longitudinal plane is visible at the end of the
ESS linac. Less than 10−3 particles are outside ±2 MeV.
The input distribution with initially 1.5% halo particles will
lead to single particle amplitudes up to 9 mm at the ESS
hybrid linac end, well outside the 6 mm boundary value of
twice the beam core size, predicted by particle-core models
[11]. The reason is the phase slippage especially at begin-
ning and end of the sc section, where the beam velocity dif-
fers by ±15% from the cavity design velocity. In the Monte
Carlo simulations all particles are experience the change of
the synchronous phase from cell to cell in the 6-cell cavity.
As a consequence, even the rms beam radii are oscillating
along the ESS hybrid linac, as the nc to sc 6d phase space
matching is done for the average cavity synchronous phase.

3 MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF

THE MISMATCHED ESS LINAC

In Fig. 4 phase space distributions are shown at the ﬁnal
1334 MeV energy for the ESS nc resp. hybrid linac, assum-
ing a mismatched input distribution with 1.5% initial halo
particles. The upper row is showing the nc and the lower
row the hybrid linac output distributions. Excited is a pure
high mode with 30 % radial and 20% axial mismatch of
the 3 bunch radii. The high mode oscillation frequency of
about 160o/period [8] causes halo formation in all 3 phase
space planes as single particle have initial frequencies of
half the high mode oscillation frequency.

Figure 4: Output distribution for the nc linac (upper row)
and the hybrid linac (lower row). The mismatched input
distribution is surrounded by 1.5% initial halo.

By assuming the same 30% pure high mode excitation,
but for an initial distribution without halo particles, the not
shown resulting phase space distributions for both, the nc
and the hybrid version of the ESS high intensity linac look
quite similiar to the shown distribution in Fig. 4. The only
difference are somewhat less particles nearby the bunch
core. But all requirements for loss free ring injection are
fullﬁlled: the ﬁnal normalized transverse rms emittance is

smaller than 0.4π mm mrad and there are about 10−3 par-
ticles outside 20ǫrms. Longitudinally there are less than
10−3 particles outside ±2 MeV , which is acceptable for
energy spread reduction by the bunch rotation system.
Adding initially 1.5% halo particles to the 30% mis-
matched dense core, the linac output distributions in Fig.
4 show a few particles withe quite large amplitudes even
in real space. Studies are going on for the motion of these
particles in the linac to compressor ring transfer line , still
effected by space charge forces [2]. Unconstrained hands
on maintenance requires less than 1 W/m uncollected de-
posited beam power at linac end and at ring injection.This
value corresponds to less than 10−7/m uncollected particle
loss for the ESS accelerator facility with its 5 MW average
beam power .

In a periodic focusing system correlated ﬁeld errors of
±1% even for same limited periodes can cause noticable
mismatch later on [12].
In front to end simulations of
the complete ESS linear accelerator, including the chop-
ping and funnel lines, the halo formation at the linac end is
caused by current ﬂuctuations, ﬁlamented RFQ output dis-
tribution and enhanced by accumulated ﬁeld errors. The so
resulting halo formation can be estimated by assuming 30%
mismatch of an unﬁlamented beam, surrounded by 1.5%
halo particles, at the entrance of the error free high energy
linac section.

Obtaining the Wakeﬁeld Due to Cell-to-Cell
Misalignments in a Linear Accelerator Structure

Karl L.F. Bane and Zenghai Li

We are interested in obtaining the long-range, dipole wakeﬁeld of a linac
structure with internal misalignments. The NLC linac structure is composed
of a collection of cups that are brazed together, and such a calculation, for
example, is important in setting the straightness tolerance for the composite
structure. Our derivation, presented here, is technically applicable only to
structures for which all modes are trapped. The modes will be trapped at
least at the ends of the structure, if the connecting beam tubes have suﬃ-
ciently small radii and the dipole modes do not couple to the fundamental
mode couplers in the end cells. For detuned structures (DS), like those in
the injector linacs of the JLC/NLC[1], most modes are trapped internally
within a structure, and those that do extend to the ends couple only weakly
to the beam; for such structures the results here can also be applied, even if
the conditions on the beam tube radii and the fundamental mode coupler do
not hold. We believe that even for the damped, detuned structures (DDS)
of the main linac of the JLC/NLC[2], which are similar, though they have
manifolds to add weak damping to the wakeﬁeld, a result very similar to
that presented here applies.

We assume a structure is composed of many cups that are misaligned
transversely by amounts that are very small compared to the cell dimensions.
For such a case we assume that the mode frequencies are the same as in the
ideal structure, and only the mode kick factors are aﬀected. To ﬁrst order
we assume that for each mode, the kick factor for the beam on-axis in the
imperfect structure is the same as for the case with the beam following the
negative of the misalignment path in the error-free structure. In Fig. 1 we
sketch a portion of such a misaligned structure (top) and the model used
for the kick factor calculation (bottom). Note that the relative size of the
misalignments is exaggerated from what is expected, in order to more clearly
show the principle. Given this model, the method of calculation of the kick
factors can be derived using the so-called “Condon Method”[3],[4] (see also
[5]). Note that this application to cell-to-cell misalignments in an accelerator

structure is presented in Ref. [6]. The results of this perturbation method
have been shown to be consistent with those using a 3-dimensional scattering
matrix analysis[7]. We will only sketch the derivation below.

Consider a closed cavity with perfectly conducting walls. For such a
cavity the Condon method expands the vector and scalar potentials, in the
Coulomb gauge, as a sum over the empty cavity modes. As function of
position x (x, y, z) and time t the vector potential in the cavity is given as

A(x, t) =

qλ(t)aλ(x)

with ωλ the frequency of mode λ, and aλ × ˆn = 0 on the metallic surface (ˆn
is a unit vector normal to the surface). Using the Coulomb gauge implies
that ∇ · aλ = 0. The qλ are given by

The scalar potential is given as

with ρ the charge distribution in the cavity. Note that one fundamental
diﬀerence between the behavior of A(x, t) and Φ(x, t) is that when there are
no charges in the cavity the vector potential can still oscillate whereas the
scalar potential must be identically equal to 0.

Let us consider an ultra-relativistic driving charge Q that passes through
the cavity parallel to the z axis, and (for simplicity) a test charge following
at a distance s behind on the same path. Both enter the cavity at position
z = 0 and leave at position z = L. The transverse wakeﬁeld at the test
charge is then

where the integrals are along the path of the particle trajectory. The param-
eter x0 is a parameter for transverse oﬀset (the transverse wake is usually
given in units of V/C per longitudinal meter per transverse meter); for a
cylindrically-symmetric structure it is usually taken to be the oﬀset, from
the axis, of the driving bunch trajectory. For s > L we can drop the scalar
potential term (it must be zero when there is no charge in the cavity), and
the result can be written in the form[5]

Note that the arbitrary constants associated with the parameter aλ in the
numerator and the denominator of Eq. 9 cancel. Note also that—to the same
arbitrary constant—|Vλ|2 is the square of the voltage lost by the driving
particle to mode λ and Uλ is the energy stored in mode λ.

Consider now the case of a cylindrically-symmetric, multi-cell acceler-
ating cavity, and let us limit our concern to the eﬀect of the dipole modes
of such a structure. We will allow the charges to move on an arbitrary,
zig-zag path in the x − z plane that is close to the axis, and for which the
slope is everywhere small (so that ∇⊥ ∼ ∂/∂x). For dipole modes in a
cylindrically-symmetric, multi-cell accelerator structure, it can shown that
the synchronous component of aλz (the only component that, on average,
is important) can be written in the form aλz = xfλ(z) (see e.g. Ref. [8]).
Then Eq. 9 becomes

with k′
λ a kind of kick factor and θλ the phase of excitation of mode λ.
Note that in the special case where the particles move parallel to the axis,
at oﬀset a, k′
λ = kλ = c|Vλ|2/(4Uλωλa2L), the normal kick factors for the
structure, and θλ = 0. For this case it can be shown that Eq. 12 is valid for
all s > 0[5]. Finally, note that, for the general case, Eq. 12 can obviously
not be extrapolated down to s = 0, since it implies that Wx(0) 6= 0, which is
nonphysical, since a point particle cannot kick itself transversely. To obtain
the proper equation valid down to s = 0 we would need to include the scalar
potential term that was dropped in going from Eq. 8 to Eq. 9.

To estimate the wakeﬁeld associated with very small, random cell-to-
cell misalignments in accelerator structures we assume that we can use the
mode eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of the error-free structure. We ob-
tain these from the circuit program. Then to ﬁnd the kick factors we replace
x(z) in the ﬁrst integral in Eq. 11 by the zig-zag path representing the neg-
ative of the cell misalignments, a path we generate using a random number
generator. The normalization factor x0 is set to the rms of the misalign-
ments.

In Ref. [1] this method is used to estimate the wake at the bunch spacings
in the S-band injector linacs of the JLC/NLC. How can we justify this?
For example, for the 3π/4 S-band structure, one possible bunch spacing is
only 42 cm whereas the whole structure length L = 4.46 m. Therefore,
in principle, Eq. 11 is not valid until the 11th bunch spacing. We believe,
however, that the scalar potential ﬁelds will not extend more than one or two
cells behind the driving charge (the cell length is 4.375 cm), and therefore
this method will be a good approximation at all bunch positions behind the
driving charge. This belief should be tested in the future by repeating the
calculation, but now also including the contribution from scalar potential
terms.

In Fig. 2 we give a numerical example. Shown, for the optimized 3π/4
S-band structure for the injector linacs of the NLC(see Ref. [1]), are the kick
factors and the phases of the modes as calculated by the method described
here. Note that θλ is not necessarily small.

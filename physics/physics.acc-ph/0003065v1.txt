The Grating Accelerator

1 Problem

In optics, a reﬂective grating is a conducting surface with a ripple. For example, consider
the surface deﬁned by

z = a sin

.

(1)

2πx

d

The typical use of such a grating involves an incident electromagnetic wave with wave vector
k in the x-z plane, and interference eﬀects lead to a discrete set of reﬂected waves also with
wave vectors in the x-z plane.

Consider, instead, an incident plane electromagnetic wave with wave vector in the y-z

plane and polarization in the x direction:

Ein = E0ˆxei(kyy−kzz−ωt),

(2)

where ky > 0 and kz > 0. Show that for small ripples (a ≪ d), this leads to a reﬂected
wave as if a = 0, plus two surface waves that are attenuated exponentially with z. What is
the relation between the grating wavelength d and the optical wavelength λ such that the x
component of the phase velocity of the surface waves is the speed of light, c?

In this case, a charged particle moving with vx ≈ c could extract energy from the wave,

which is the principle of the proposed “grating accelerator” [1, 2, 3].

2 Solution

The interaction between particle beams and diﬀraction gratings was ﬁrst considered by Smith
and Purcell [4], who emphasized energy transfer from the particle to free electromagnetic
waves. The excitation of surface waves by particles near conducting structures was ﬁrst
discussed by Pierce [5], which led to the extensive topic of wakeﬁelds in particle accelerators.
The presence of surface waves in the Smith-Purcell eﬀect was noted by di Francia [6]. A
detailed treatment of surface waves near a diﬀraction grating was given by van den Berg
[7]. Here, we construct a solution containing surface waves by starting with only free waves,
then adding surface waves to satisfy the boundary condition at the grating surface.

If the (perfectly) conducting surface were ﬂat, the reﬂected wave would be

Er = −E0ˆxei(kyy+kzz−ωt).

(3)

However, the sum Ein + Er does not satisfy the boundary condition that Etotal must be

perpendicular to the wavy surface (1). Indeed,

[Ein + Er]surface = 2iE0ˆxei(kyy−ωt) sin kzz ≈ 2iakzE0ˆxei(kyy−ωt) sin kxx,

(4)

where the approximation holds for a ≪ d, and we have deﬁned kx = 2π/d.

Hence, we require additional ﬁelds near the surface to cancel that given by (4). For z ≈ 0,

these ﬁelds therefore have the form

This can be decomposed into two waves E± given by

E = −akzE0ˆxei(kyy−ωt)(cid:16)eikxx − e−ikxx(cid:17) .

E± = ∓akzE0ˆxei(±kxx+kyy−ωt).

(5)

(6)

Away from the surface, we suppose that the z dependence of the additional waves can

be described by including a factor eik′

zz. Then, the full form of the additional waves is

E± = ∓akzE0ˆxei(±kxx+kyy+k′

zz−ωt).

(7)

The constant k′
wave equation,

z is determined on requiring that each of the additional waves satisfy the

∇2E± =

c2

∂2E±
∂t2 .

This leads to the dispersion relation

z =

The component ky of the incident wave vector can be written in terms of the angle of
incidence θin and the wavelength λ as

Combining (9) and (10), we have

ky =

2π

sin θin.

For short wavelengths, k′

z is real and positive, so the reﬂected wave (3) is accompa-
z). But for long enough

nied by two additional plane waves with direction cosines (kx, ky, k′
wavelengths, k′

z is imaginary, and the additional waves are exponentially attenuated in z.

When surface waves are present, consider the ﬁelds along the line y = 0, z = π/2kz. Here,
the incident plus reﬂected ﬁelds vanish (see the ﬁrst form of (4)), and the surface waves are

E± = ∓akze−π|k′

z|/2kz E0ˆxei(±kxx−ωt).

The phase velocity of these waves is

vp =

c.

When d = λ, the phase velocity is c, and k′
then,

z = iky according to (11). The surface waves are

E± = ∓

e−(π/2) tan θinE0ˆxei(±kxx−ωt).

d

A relativistic charged particle that moves in, say, the +x direction remains in phase with
the wave E+, and can extract energy from that wave for phases near π. On average, the
particle’s energy is not aﬀected by the counterpropagating wave E−. In principle, signiﬁcant
particle acceleration can be achieved via this technique. For a small angle of incidence, and
with a/d = 1/2π, the accelerating ﬁeld strength is equal to that of the incident wave.

We show, through modeling and simulation, that it is feasible to construct a storage ring that will
store dense bunches of strong-ﬁeld-seeking polar molecules at 30 m/s (kinetic energy of 2K) and hold
them, for several minutes, against losses due to defocusing, oscillations, and diﬀusion. The ring, 3 m
in diameter, has straight sections that aﬀord access to the stored molecules and a lattice structure
that may be adapted for evaporative cooling. Simulation is done using a newly-developed code that
tracks the particles, in time, through 400 turns; it accounts for longitudinal velocity changes as a
function of external electric ﬁeld, focusing and deﬂection nonlinearities, and the eﬀects of gravity.
An injector, decelerator, and source are included and intensities are calculated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

To date, all gaseous quantum condensates have been
produced by evaporative cooling of conﬁned atoms. Con-
ﬁnement is necessary to thermally isolate the parti-
cles from the warmer environment and long conﬁnement
times are necessary because the evaporative cooling pro-
cess can take tens of seconds.

Strong magnetic ﬁeld gradients have been used to
conﬁne neutral paramagnetic molecules [1] and electric-
ﬁeld gradients have been used to conﬁne neutral polar
molecules in electrostatic traps [2] and in toroidal stor-
age rings [3, 4]. In addition, polar molecule conﬁnement
in a synchrotron storage ring has been modeled [5].

All of these methods use molecules or atoms in weak-
ﬁeld-seeking states, whose binding energy decreases in
the ﬁeld. These states are not the lowest energy state and
are therefore subject to collisional relaxation. In alkali
atoms, the relaxation rates from the stretched hyperﬁne
levels (mF = F ) is small. But in magnetically trapped
paramagnetic molecules [6] and in electrically conﬁned
polar molecules [7, 8, 9, 10], the relaxation rate can be
large enough to prevent achieving the conﬁnement time
needed for evaporative cooling.

Collisional relaxation will be absent for polar molecules
in their lowest rotational state. This ground state is
strong-ﬁeld-seeking, as are all rotational states in the
limit of strong electric ﬁeld. The technical challenges
of storing molecules in a strong-ﬁeld-seeking state have
not been previously addressed. The major challenge is
focusing these molecules because electrostatic lenses can

focus strong-ﬁeld-seeking molecules in only one trans-
verse plane while defocusing in the other. Therefore
alternating-gradient focusing is required.

For experiments on molecules in strong-ﬁeld-seeking
states, a storage ring has some useful features not gener-
ally found in traps. The ring has a beam geometry with
ﬁeld-free regions accessible to experiments, and it can si-
multaneously store many bunches of particles producing
a large ﬂux of molecules.

In this paper we show, by modeling and simulation,
that it is feasible to construct a storage ring (Fig.1) that
will store a symmetric-top molecule (methyl ﬂuoride) in
the J = 0 state, at a kinetic energy of 2 K (30 m/s),
and by extension other molecules and velocities. In the
storage ring, bunching electrodes hold the molecules in
a string of short bunches. The molecules are calculated
to be stable against losses due to defocusing, oscillations,
and diﬀusion for over two minutes. We also model a
decelerator for slowing the molecules to 30 m/s, and an
injector for loading the storage ring.

A storage ring in which the density of the molecules in
a bunch is allowed to vary around the ring, can provide a
mechanism for evaporative cooling. Regions of high den-
sity speed the thermalization of the molecules. In regions
of low density the molecules can become spatially sepa-
rated due to their velocity spread allowing the hottest
molecules to be removed.

FIG. 1: Layout of the storage ring. Each octant contains a
buncher and a pair of alternating-gradient focusing triplets to
match the beam traversing from the straight sections to the
bend sections. A bend section contains combined bend and al-
ternating gradient focusing elements. The focusing and bend
elements have time-independent electric ﬁelds. An injection
line is located in one of the straight sections

application to methyl ﬂuoride in the J = 0 state, may be
found in Kalnins et al. [11].

The guide ﬁeld in a storage ring for molecules in strong-
ﬁeld-seeking states must provide all the functions, such
as focusing, bending, and bunching, that are used in a
ring for charged particles but with forces that arise from
gradients of the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld.

In a pure quadrupole or sextupole ﬁeld, the total elec-
tric ﬁeld increases radially and the force on a molecule,
in a strong-ﬁeld-seeking state, is away from the center-
line in all transverse directions. Therefore a dipole com-
ponent must be added to remove the double-defocusing,
and obtain focusing in one transverse direction while still
defocusing in the other. The force on a molecule is given
by the gradient of its Stark potential energy, W (E):

tipole potential used to bend and focus a molecule is:

Ψ = E0[y + A2xy + A3(x2y −

y3

)]

(2)

where E0 is the dipole ﬁeld strength, and A2 and A3
are the relative quadrupole and sextupole component
strengths.

For the Stark energy in the high-ﬁeld limit, the forces

to second order are:

Fx → deE0[A2 + 2A3x −
Fy → deE0[(A2

(A3
2 − 2A3)y − (A3

2

2 − 4A2A3)y2]

2 − 4A2A3)xy]

(3)

We see that a combined dipole and sextupole (A3) ﬁeld
lens will focus in one plane, while defocusing in the other.
To deﬂect the molecule we must add a quadrupole (A2)
component. This also defocuses the beam in the y di-
rection and stronger sextupole (A3) strengths are needed
[12].

To obtain net focusing in both transverse planes, the
lenses are arranged in a sequence with gradients alter-
nating in sign (A3 < 0 for x-focusing and A3 >0 for
y-focusing).

B. Other Eﬀects

When a molecule in a strong-ﬁeld-seeking state enters
the ﬁeld of an electrode pair it is accelerated longitudi-
nally, and upon exiting the ﬁeld it is decelerated. Also,
the fringing ﬁeld is stronger away from the midplane and
this causes a net defocusing force in the direction of the
electric ﬁeld. Between successive sets of electrodes, this
unwanted defocusing is reduced if the dipole ﬁelds are of
the same polarity and strength.

Longitudinal bunching, as in a charged-particle ring,
requires a pulsed ﬁeld. The ﬁeld is ramped in a sawtooth
or sine-wave form and the time-dependent acceleration is
the net diﬀerence between the ﬁelds when entering and
when exiting.

The eﬀect of gravity is small but not negligible for 30
m/s molecules in this ring. The vertical orbit will be
distorted and an orbit correction must be applied.

The equations of motion of a molecule in the ring are

where E is the magnitude of an external ﬁeld.

The Stark energy of the molecular level is in general
a nonlinear function and is described for methyl ﬂuoride
in the J = 0 rotational state in Ref.
[11]. In the limit
of large E, W (E) → −deE where de is the molecule’s
electric dipole moment.

The longitudinal variation of the Stark energy at the
ends of electrodes (treated here as a step function) adds
or subtracts from the kinetic energy, the change in lon-

III. STORAGE RING DESIGN

A. Molecule and Energy

The principles and techniques we use apply to all po-
lar molecules in strong-ﬁeld-seeking states. We choose
methyl ﬂuoride (CH3F) as our reference molecule because
it is a nearly symmetric rotor with a large electric dipole
moment of de = 6.2 × 10−30 C-m (1.84 D). It has a mod-
erate rotational constant of B = 0.88 cm−1 and a simple
level structure with a J = K = 0 rotational ground state.
The rotational constant is large enough to limit the num-
ber of rotational levels populated in the beam from a jet-
source but still small enough to allow for a large Stark
eﬀect at moderate electric ﬁelds. Methyl ﬂuoride is also
a gas at room temperature.

The velocity of 30 m/s (kinetic energy of about 2K) is
low enough to make for a compact ring, yet keep small
the eﬀects of gravity.

B. Ring Lattice

Long straight regions free of focusing electrodes make
the stored beam accessible for experiments and give space
for injection and extraction. Molecules, in order to drift
through the straight section without loss, must have only
small divergences and therefore a large beam width. In a
bending region, we need strong deﬂecting forces to min-
imize the bend radius for overall compactness. These
strong forces call for a small beam width to avoid non-
linearities. To make the transition (match) from straight
sections to arc sections, triplets (Q1, Q2, Q3) of focusing
lenses are placed at the ends of the straight sections, as
shown in Fig. 1.

In each of the eight bend regions, there are ﬁve elec-
trode pairs; each has a combined dipole and quadrupole
ﬁeld to provide the strong deﬂecting force. To this is
added a sextupole component, the gradient of which al-
ternates in sign.

The electrode parameters are given in Table I where
Q are focusing elements and BF and BD are combined

bend and focusing elements. Each arc is a series of BF
and BD elements: 1

2 BF+BD+BF+BD+ 1
In this sequence of lenses with alternating gradients,
the molecules execute oscillatory transverse motions.
The parameters of BF and BD are chosen such that the
phases of these horizontal and vertical motions each ad-
vance through an angle of 2π in each octant of arc. The
parameters of Q1, Q2 and Q3 are varied to ﬁnd values
that produce large dynamic aperture and momentum ac-
ceptance. The decapole coeﬃcient, A5 of Q2, which adds
the term E0A5(x4y −2x2y2 + 1
5 y5) to the potential Eq(2),
is introduced to reduce the nonlinearity of Q2 focusing
where the beam is at it’s largest. For longitudinal con-
ﬁnement with many short bunches, we use eight bunchers
in the ring; each has a short uniform ﬁeld that is pulsed
in time as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Molecules with diﬀerent energies have their closed or-
bits radially separated in the arcs and perhaps elsewhere
in the ring.
If this dispersion of orbits is present at a
buncher, the energy change from the buncher produces
a shift in the orbit and an increment in the radial os-
cillation. This is called synchro-betatron coupling and
to avoid growth of radial oscillation amplitude, the dis-
persion of orbits must be made zero at the bunchers.
With the phases of the vertical and horizontal motions
advancing through an angle of 2π in each octant, as noted
above, the dispersion becomes zero at all eight buncher
locations.

tance in which the transverse (betatron) oscillation advances

C. Numerical Modeling and Simulation

The lattice parameters (Table I) are found by numeri-
cal calculations using a newly-developed simulation code
that tracks the particles in time (rather than in longi-
tudinal position) to account for the longitudinal velocity
changes as a function of the external ﬁeld. The tracking
code includes the eﬀects of nonlinearities, gravity and
the longitudinal kick at the bunchers. The eﬀect of each
fringe ﬁeld (Eq. 6) in every element has been integrated
and replaced by a vertically defocusing thin lens. The pa-
rameters in Table I result in the ring performance listed
in Table. II and shown in Figures 3 and 4.

The beta functions and the horizontal dispersion are
shown in Fig. 3b. Small beta functions in the bends pro-
duce a smaller beam proﬁle, allowing the bend elements
to be stronger and the beam to occupy the most linear
region of the elements. The straight sections are designed
to be free of horizontal dispersion to avoid synchro-beta
coupling at the bunchers.

If uncorrected, the vertical closed orbit displacement
caused by gravity is 2.6 mm and is large enough to cause
loss of the circulating beam. The orbit is corrected by
displacing Q2 by 0.24 mm downward to produce upward
kicks. The resulting vertical orbit distortion shrinks to
0.26 mm as shown in Fig. 5 and is no longer a problem.
With this orbit correction, the dynamic aperture for
400 turns, at the center of a straight section, is about
2 mm by 3 mm half-width as shown in Fig. 4. This
dynamic aperture corresponds to acceptances of 11 mm-
mr horizontal and 21 mm-mr vertical, as listed in Table
II. The resulting beam size is shown in Fig. 3a. The

IV. DECELERATED BEAM

A. Decelerator

To reduce the velocity from the 310 m/s at the source
to 30 m/s requires many stages of deceleration by pulsed
electric ﬁelds in a long linear array. At each of the 139
decelerating stages, a bunch of molecules enters a set of
parallel electrodes when the ﬁeld is zero; the ﬁeld pulses
on and the molecules lose kinetic energy equal to |W (E)|
as they exit the electrodes.

Our decelerator design diﬀers in almost every way from
previous designs [13, 14]. A decrease in the strength
of the electric ﬁeld while the bunch exits the electrodes
provides longitudinal restoring action that prevents the
bunch lengthening due to velocity spread [15]. The
lengths of successive electrodes decreases as the velocity
and spacing of the bunches decreases.

Interspersed between the pulsed parallel electrodes
are alternating-gradient lenses to conﬁne the molecules
transversely. Their overall focusing action must be
stronger in the plane of the electric ﬁelds to counter the
defocusing from fringe ﬁelds. The major parameters of
the decelerator are summarized in Table III. Details of
decelerator design will be published later.

B.

Injector

To inject the beam, we need a bend electrode that can
pulse on or oﬀ in the time between buckets in the ring.
This allows us to store multiple (up to 203) bunches in
the ring. The deﬂecting electrode (Fig.1) is part of a
transport line that transforms the pulse leaving the de-
celerator to match the orientation of the transverse ac-
ceptances of the ring at the point of entry onto the closed
orbit of the ring. The deﬂecting electrode is actually an
array of bend electrodes with radius 0.6 m, similar to a
bend section in the ring. A horizontal phase advance of
2π in this bend, avoids a net dispersal of molecules that
are within the ±2 % velocity spread.

In passage along the line, the velocity spread of ±2%

lengthens the bunch and a debuncher at the point of in-
jection (Fig 1) brings 90% of the bunch within the ±1.2%
longitudinal momentum acceptance of the ring.

C. Source and Intensity

We calculate the intensity based upon a pulsed jet
source with 1% methyl ﬂuoride seeded in xenon carrier
gas, using the equations in Miller [16] and veriﬁed against
seeded xenon jet source performance reported in the liter-
ature [3, 4, 17]. Xenon’s high mass (133) produces much
slower beams (310 m/s from a room-temperature reser-
voir) than do light carrier gases, resulting in a shorter
(19.6 m) decelerator.

The bunch intensity is determined by the source ﬂow
rate, the J = 0 state population, the velocity distribu-
tion and the acceptances. A source oriﬁce of 1 mm di-
ameter and reservoir pressure of 6.56 × 104 Pa (500 Torr)
will produce an intense cold beam with a peak intensity
of 3 × 1019 molecules sr−1 s−1, a longitudinal velocity
spread of 7.2 m/s FWHM, and less than 1% clusters.
We estimate the methyl ﬂuoride J = 0 rotational state
fraction to be 30%. In an apparatus with a ﬁnite pump-
ing speed, this peak intensity is possibly only by using a
pulsed jet source operating with a small duty cycle. The
short widely-spaced beam pulses entering the decelerator
(which become more closely spaced after deceleration) re-
quire a duty cycle of less than one percent for a 100 Hz
pulse rate. This would allow all 203 buckets in the ring
to be ﬁlled in 6.4 turns.

The transverse and the longitudinal emittances (units
of m2 s−1) of a bunch of molecules are unchanged in pass-
ing through the deceleration process[18] from the source
to their injection in the storage ring. Therefore the frac-
tion of molecules from the source that enters the ring is
the product of the ratios of ring acceptances to source
emittances. In the transverse directions, the beam from
the source has ±0.5 mm spatial extents and ±1000 mr an-

gular divergences; then the horizontal and vertical accep-
tances of the storage ring (Table II) of 11 mm-mr and 21
mm-mr respectively, result in 8.66×10−6 of the molecules
being transversely accepted. Longitudinally, one second
of beam from the source is 310 m long and has a velocity
spread of ±3.6 m/s. The storage ring will accept ±0.6
m/s in a 10-mm long bunch, which is 5.4 × 10−6 of the
source longitudinal emittance.

Combining these nunbers and acounting for the 90%
acceptance of the storage ring from the injector yields an
intensity of 3.8 × 108 molecules/bunch. Bunches could
be injected into the storage ring singularly or in large
numbers. With a maximum of 203 stored bunches there
would be nearly 1011 molecules circulating in the storage
ring and a ﬂux of 2.5 × 1011 molecules/s. Each bunch

would have a density of about 3 ×109 molecules/cm3 in
the long straight sections, and higher in the bends.

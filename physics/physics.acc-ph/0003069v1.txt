Abstract

The general expression of the Stern-Gerlach force is deduced for a charged

particle, endowed with a magnetic moment, which travels inside a time vary-
ing magnetic ﬁeld. Then, the energy integral of the Stern-Gerlach force is
evaluated in the case of a particle crossing a TE rf cavity with its magnetic
moment oriented in different ways with respect as the cavity axis. We shall
demonstrate that appropriate choices of the cavity characteristics and of the
spin orientation conﬁrm the possibility of separating in energy the opposite
spin states of a fermion beam circulating in a storage ring and, in addition,
make feasible an absolute polarimeter provide that a parametric converter
acting between two coupled cavities is implemented.

1 Introduction

The Stern-Gerlach force acts on particles, carrying a magnetic moment, which
cross inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds. In a reference frame where particles are at
rest, the expression of this force is

~S

is the magnetic moment. Here e = ±1.602 × 10−19 C is the elementary charge
with + for p, e+ and − for ¯p, e−, making ~µ and ~S either parallel or antiparallel,
respectively. The rest mass, m, is 1.67× 10−27 kg for p, ¯p and 9.11× 10−31 kg for
e±, and the relation between the gyromagnetic ratio g and the anomaly a is

In the rest system, the quantum vector ~S, named spin, has modulus |~S| =
qs(s + 1) ¯h, and its component parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld lines can take only

the following values:

where ¯h = 1.05 × 10−34 Js the reduced Planck’s constant. Combining Eqs. (3)
and (5) we obtain for a generic spin- 1

Aiming to have the expression of the Stern-Gerlach force in the laboratory
frame, we have ﬁrst to carry out the Lorentz transformation of the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld from the laboratory frame, where we are at rest, to the center-of-
mass frame, where particles are at rest and we can correctly evaluate such a force.
Then this force must be boosted back to the laboratory frame. All of these rather
cumbersome operations will be discussed in the next Section.

2 Lorentz Boost of a Force

In order to accomplish the sequence of Lorentz boosts more easily, we choose
a Cartesian 4-dimensional Minkowski metric [1] (x1, x2, x3, x4) = (x, y, z, ict),

where i = √−1. Therefore, the back-and-forth Lorentz transformations between

laboratory frame and particle’s rest frame (usually labeled with a prime) are the
following:

The 4-vector formalism is still applied for undergoing the Lorentz transforma-

where

is the differential of the proper time. We deﬁne the 4-momentum as the product
of the rest mass m times the 4-velocity, i.e.

Pµ = m uµ = (~p, iγmc)

(15)

The 4-force is the derivative of the 4-momentum (15) with respect to the proper
time, that is

where ~f is the ordinary force. In the c.m. system eq. (16) reduces to

3 Stern-Gerlach Force

The Stern-Gerlach force, as described by eq. (1), must be evaluated in the particle
rest frame where it takes the form

~f ′
SG = ∇′(~µ∗ · ~B′) =

having deﬁned the magnetic moment as µ∗, rather than µ′, for opportune reasons.
By applying the transformations (11), (19) and (20), the force (21) is boosted to
the laboratory system becoming

We have to recall that the polarization of a beam, revolving in a ring whose

P =

N↑ − N↓
N↑ + N↓

(41)

where
N↑ = No. Particles Spin Up (e.g. parallel to ~Bring)
N↓ = No. Particles Spin Down (antiparallel to ~Bring)
and P indicates the macroscopic average over the particle distribution in the beam,
which is equivalent to the quantum mechanical expectation value found by means

7

of the quantum statistical matrix. Obviously, an unpolarized beam has P = 0 or
N↑ = N↓.

A quick comparison among the SG-force components, given by the set of
equations (26)-(31), suggests that fz will dominate at high energy, since it con-
tains terms proportional to γ2, whereas the transverse components have terms
independent of γ, not to mention the γ−1 terms.

The most appropriate choice of the spin orientation seems to be the one parallel
to ˆy i.e. to ~Bring, i.e. the force component is the one given by eq. (28) with the
insertion of eq. (30). This means that particles undergoing energy gain (or loss)
don’t need any spin rotation while entering and leaving the rf cavity, beyond the
advantage of having to deal with a force component proportional to γ2. Choosing
the simplest TE011 mode, the quantities (38), (39) and (40) reduce to

Before making up our mind, we need to compare the energy gain/loss due to
the Stern-Gerlach interaction with the same quantity caused by the electric ﬁeld.
To this aim, we emphasize that

dUE = ~fE · d~r = eExdx

(60)

as can be easily understood looking at eqs. (47) and (48). Since the carrier particle
travels from 0 to d along the z-axis, the only integral which makes sense is the
following:

having proceeded as before.

We recall that the Stern-Gerlach interaction in the realm of particle acceler-
ators has been proposed either for separating in energy particles with opposite
spin states, the well known [5] spin-splitter concept, or for settling an absolute
polarimeter [6].

As far as the spin-splitter is concerned, we quickly recall that spin up parti-
cles receive (or loose) that amount of energy given by eq. (54) at each rf cavity
crossing, and this will take place all over the time required. Simultaneously, spin
down particles behave exactly in the opposite way, i.e. they loose (or gain) the
same amount of energy turn after turn. The actual most important issue is that the
energy exchanges sum up coherently. More quantitatively, we may indicate as the
ﬁnal energy separation after N revolutions:

∆↑↓ = X{∆↑ − (−∆↓)} = 4

b
d

N µ∗B0 γ2 ≃ 4 N µ∗B0 γ2

(63)

Instead, the adding up of the energy contribution (62) due to the electric ﬁeld is

(64)

(∆UE)tot = X ∆UE = κ X x′ = 0

since x′ changes continuously its sign with a periodicity related to the period of
the betatron oscillations.

The result (63), together with the demonstration (64), would seem to provide

very good news for the spin-splitter method!

As far as the polarimeter is concerned, we have to bear in mind that we are
interested in the instantaneous interaction between magnetic moment and the rf
ﬁelds: therefore the zero-averaging due to the incoherence of the betatron oscilla-
tions would not help us. Notwithstanding, if we set βph equal to an integer in eq.
(62), we have for U.R. particles:

Then this 1/γ2 dependence of the spurious signal, compared to the γ2 dependence
of the signal (54) to be measured, sounds interesting for the feasibility of this kind
of polarimeter; however, one must realize that if βph is not exactly an integer, then
eq. (65) would become

6 A Few Numerical Examples

The spin-splitter principle requires a repetitive crossing of Ncav cavities distributed
along the ring, each of them resonating in the TE mode. After each revolution, the
particle experiences a variation, or kick, of its energy or of its momentum spread

In the example of the polarimeter we have to pick up a signal generated at
each cavity crossing. Therefore, making use of eq. (54) we have for a bunch train
made up of N particles the total energy transfer

∆U ≈ 2NP µ∗B0

where P is the beam polarization slightly modiﬁed with respect the deﬁnition (41)

The average power transferred will be

If we operate our cavity as a parametric converter [9][10], with an initially

empty level, we have for the power transferred to this empty level

where νrf is the working frequency of the resonant cavity (typically in the GHz

A feasibility test of the polarimeter principle has been proposed [6] and studied
[11] to be carried out in the 500 MeV electron ring [12] of MIT- Bates, whose main
characteristics are

and, since polarized electrons can be injected into this ring but precessing on
a horizontal plane, the TE101 mode is more appropriate than the TE011 as we
shall have to use Bx rather than By: a choice that does not make any substantial
difference! From the above data we obtain

W2 ≃ 137P watts

(76)
Paradoxically, even for an almost unpolarized beam with N→ − N← = 1
and, as a consequence of eq. (72), with P ≃ 1.23 × 10−11, we should obtain
W2 ≈ 1.7 nW, which can be easily measured.
As a last check, let us compare the energy exchanges (~µ ⇔ ~B) and (e ⇔ ~E).
Taking into account eqs. (52), (54) and (65), and setting x′ ≃ 1 mrad, βph = 2
and λ = 10 cm, we have for the Bates-MIT ring:

i.e.
the spurious signal, depending upon the electric interaction between e and
~E, is absolutely negligible with respect the measurable signal generated by the
magnetic interaction.

7 Conclusions

There is not too much to add to what has been found in the previous Sections,
aside from performing more accurate calculations and numerical simulations. The
Stern-Gerlach interaction seems very promising either for attaining the self polar-
ization of a p(¯p) beam or for realizing an absolute polarimeter.

In the ﬁrst example the problem raised [13] by the rf ﬁlamentation still holds
on, although some tricks can be conceived: the extreme one could be the imple-
mentation of a triangular waveform in the TM cavity which bunches the beam.

The second example requires nothing but to implement that experimental test

at the Bates-MIT electron ring.

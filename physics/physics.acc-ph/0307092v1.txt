Abstract

Pump-probe experiments combining pulses from a X-ray FEL and an optical
femtosecond laser are very attractive for sub-picosecond time-resolved studies. Since
the synchronization between the two independent light sources to an accuracy of
100 fs is not yet solved, it is proposed to derive both femtosecond radiation pulses
from the same electron bunch but from two insertion devices. This eliminates the
need for synchronization and developing a tunable high power femtosecond quantum
laser. In the proposed scheme a GW-level soft X-ray pulse is naturally synchronized
with a GW-level optical pulse, independent of any jitter in the arrival time of the
electron bunches. The concept is based on the generation of optical radiation in
a master oscillator-power FEL ampliﬁer (MOPA) conﬁguration. X-ray radiation
is generated in an X-ray undulator inserted between the modulator and radiator
sections of the optical MOPA scheme. An attractive feature of the FEL ampliﬁer
scheme is the absence of any apparent limitations which could prevent operation in
the femtosecond regime in a wide (200-900 nm) wavelength range. A commercially
available long (nanosecond) pulse dye laser can be used as seed laser.

1 Introduction

Time-resolved experiments are used to monitor time-dependent phenomena. In a typical
pump-probe experiment a short probe pulse follows a short pump pulse at some speciﬁed
delay. The pump pulse triggers the system, for example it heats up the sample and produces a
plasma, or it starts a photo-chemical reaction, and the probe pulse causes a signal recorded by
a conventional, slow detector which reﬂects the state of the sample during the brief probing.
The experiment must be repeated many times with diﬀerent delays in order to reconstruct
the femtosecond dynamical process. Femtosecond capabilities have been available for some
years at visible wavelengths. However, there is a strong interest in extending these techniques
to X-ray wavelengths because they allow to probe directly structural changes with atomic
resolution.

Recent progress in free electron laser (FEL) techniques have paved the way for the pro-
duction of GW-level, sub-100 fs, coherent X-ray pulses. This has recently been demonstrated
experimentally at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) at DESY [1], although only at vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV) wavelengths down to 80 nm. First user experiments have led to exciting
results [2]. A SASE X-ray FEL (SASE stands for self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission) will
be commissioned as a user facility in 2004 at DESY, covering the VUV and soft X-ray range
down to 6 nm wavelength. The unique properties of this new source are attracting much
attention in a wide science community. The short-wavelength, GW-level radiation pulses
with sub-100 fs duration are particularly interesting for time-resolved studies of transient
structures of matter on the time scale of chemical reactions.

The straightforward approach for pump-probe experiments, the combination of the X-ray
FEL with a conventional quantum laser system, is presently being realized at the TESLA Test
Facility at DESY [3]. The laser system comprises a seed pulse laser, special synchronization
with the accelerator, pulse shaping, and a pump laser together with an optical parametric
ampliﬁer (OPA). The laser will initially cover the spectral region between 750 nm and 900
nm and will provide a train of 200 MW-level pulses with 200 fs pulse duration synchronized
with the FEL. The main challenges are the development of the high power OPA and the
synchronization system. The SASE FEL can produce radiation pulses shorter than 100 fs,
hence the synchronization should be at least as good. The main uncertainty is the time
jitter of the electron bunches. The latter is produced in the magnetic bunch compressors
and is estimated to ±1ps for the expected ±0.1% energy jitter of the electron bunch. At the
moment it is not clear by how much this time jitter can be reduced, and where the limits
are for the electronic synchronization.

If we consider the standard technique for high-resolution time-resolved measurements, we
ﬁnd that the problem of synchronization of the two optical pulses usually does not exist at all.
For very high resolution studies with optical quantum lasers in the femtosecond regime the
two optical pulses are always derived from the same laser to ensure perfect synchronization,
and the time diﬀerence is adjusted by changing the path length through an optical delay line.
Pump-probe experiments combining pulses from a X-ray FEL and a quantum laser are more
diﬃcult. The synchronization of an independent optical laser with the FEL pulses is the most
challenging task of this type of pump-probe technique. Picosecond time resolved work can
be performed using known techniques. Sub-picosecond synchronization, on the other hand,
needs further development.

The new method proposed in this paper is an attempt to get around the synchronization

Fig. 1. Scheme for pump-probe experiments employing an optical pulse as a pump and a soft X-ray
pulse as a probe or vice versa. A very long laser pulse is used for modulation of the energy and
density of the electrons at the optical frequency. Optical photons for pump-probe experiments are
generated by an additional insertion device (optical radiator) using the same electron bunch

obstacle by using a two step FEL process, in which two diﬀerent frequencies (colors) are
generated by the same femtosecond electron bunch. This method could be a very interesting
alternative to the ”independent optical quantum laser- SASE FEL” approach, and it has the
further advantage to make a wide frequency range accessible at high peak power and high
repetition rates not so easily available from conventional lasers.

The concept of the proposal is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Two diﬀerent frequen-
cies (colors) are generated by the same electron bunch, but in diﬀerent insertion devices. The
optical radiation is generated in a master oscillator-power FEL ampliﬁer (MOPA) conﬁgura-
tion. The X-ray radiation is generated in a X-ray undulator inserted between modulator and
radiator sections of the optical MOPA scheme. The scheme operates as follows: The electron
beam and the optical pulse from the seed laser enter the modulator radiator. Due to the
FEL process the electron bunch gains energy modulation at the optical frequency which is
then transformed to a density modulation in the dispersion section. The density modulation
exiting the modulator (i.e. the energy-modulation undulator and the dispersion section) is
about 10 − 20%. Thus, the optical seeding signal is imprinted in the electron bunch. Then
the electron bunch is directed to the X-ray undulator. The process of ampliﬁcation of the
radiation in the main (soft X-ray) undulator develops in the same way as in the conventional
SASE FEL: ﬂuctuations of the electron beam current density serve as input signal. At the
chosen level of density modulation the SASE process develops nearly in the same way as
with an unmodulated electron beam because of the large ratio of the cooperation length
to the optical wavelength [4]. As a result, at the exit of the X-ray undulator the electron
bunch produces a GW-level X-ray pulse. A GW-level optical pulse is then produced when
the electron bunch passes the optical radiator. The optical radiator is a conventional FEL
ampliﬁer seeded by the density modulation in the electron bunch. Although the electron
beam leaving the soft X-ray FEL has acquired some additional energy spread, it is still a
good ”active medium” for an optical radiator at the end. Approximately 20% of density
modulation is suﬃcient to drive the optical FEL ampliﬁer in the nonlinear regime and to
produce GW-level optical pulses in a short undulator.

2

An important feature of the proposed scheme is that the optical radiator uses the spent
electron beam. As a result, the optical FEL can operate in saturation mode without inter-
fering with the soft X-ray SASE FEL operation.

We illustrate the two-color FEL ampliﬁer scheme for the parameters of the TESLA
Test Facility at DESY. The proposed pump-probe facility has unique features: Both, X-
ray and optical pulses, have very high peak power in the GW range. Both wavelengths are
continuously and independently tunable in a wide range: 200 − 900 nm for the optical pulses,
and 6 − 120 nm for the X-ray pulses. Both pulses have diﬀraction limited angular divergence.
The spectral width of the optical pulse is transform limited. Finally, the optical and X-ray
pulses are precisely synchronized at a femtosecond level, since they both are produced by
the same electron pulse, and there are no reasons for any time jitter between them.

2 Two-color FEL ampliﬁer at the TESLA Test Facility

Figure 2 shows the layout of the soft X-ray FEL in the ﬁrst phase, including the linear
accelerator with two magnetic bunch compressors and six undulator modules at the end of
the accelerator tunnel. The ﬁrst goal is to reach saturation in the soft X-ray range with this
conﬁguration, using the six undulator modules in SASE mode. In a second step the free
space in front of the undulator will be used to build a fully coherent soft X-ray facility based
on the two stage self-seeding concept [5].

The two-color FEL ampliﬁer employs additional undulators to generate the second color
radiation pulses. It requires free space in front of and behind the main soft X-ray FEL undu-
lator which has already been foreseen at the design stage of the TTF FEL, Phase 2. Figure 3
shows the location of additional hardware components: the seed laser, the modulator undu-
lator, a dispersion section, the main soft X-ray SASE undulator, and the optical undulator.
The parameters of the hardware components required for the optical part of the pump-probe
facility are listed in Table 1.

A commercially available dye laser, for example, can be used as a seed laser. The typical
pulse energy of a dye laser system is in the range of 2 to 10 mJ with a pulse duration of
5–10 ns, and the peak power is in the range of 1 MW which gives us suﬃcient safety margin
for operation of the modulator. The installation of a seed laser is greatly facilitated by the
fact that the magnetic chicane of the electron beam collimation system allows to insert a

view port for the input optical system. Also it is very important, that there is free space
downstream of the main undulator (see Fig. 3) available for the optical radiator.

Both modulator and radiator undulators are identical tunable-gap devices similar to
those used at DORIS. The dispersion section is composed of four standard bending magnets
similar to those used at the HERA storage ring. Therefore, this optical radiation source could
be realized at the TESLA Test Facility rather quickly and with minimum cost expenses.

3 Generation of two-color radiation pulses

The principle of two-color femtosecond pulse generation has been sketched brieﬂy in
Sections 1 and 2. Here we present a detailed description of the physical processes in both the
optical and X-ray undulators. The parameters of the optical part of the facility have been
optimized using the time-dependent FEL simulation code FAST [6]. Starting point for the
optimization were the parameters of the TESLA Test Facility, Phase 2, given in an update
[7] to the original design report [8]. The FEL at DESY will cover the wavelength range from
120 to 6 nm. Two modes of operation are currently foreseen:

(1) femtosecond mode (for λ = 30 − 120 nm, pulse duration 50-100 fs);
(2) short wavelength mode (for λ = 6 − 30 nm, pulse duration 200 fs).

The analysis of experimental results obtained at the TTF FEL, Phase 1, showed that
the local energy spread is less than 0.2 MeV [9] which is signiﬁcantly less than the previous
project value of 1 MeV. This low value of the local energy spread improves signiﬁcantly the
operation of both the optical and the X-ray FEL and extends the safety margin for operation.

The operation of the two-color femtosecond facility is illustrated for the two modes of FEL
operation: short wavelength mode with a bunch shape close to gaussian, and femtosecond
mode when the electron bunch has a strongly non-gaussian shape with an intense leading
peak [1,7]. We demonstrate that the two-color facility will work eﬀectively in both cases.

3.1 Operation of the optical modulator

The optical modulator consists of three elements: the optical seed laser, the modulator
undulator, and the dispersion section. The seed laser pulse interacts with the electron beam
in the modulator undulator which is resonant with the laser frequency ωopt, and produces
an energy modulation of P0 in the electron bunch. The amplitude of the induced beam
modulation is small, typically of about a percent only. The electron beam then passes through
the dispersion section where the energy modulation is converted to a density modulation at
the optical wavelength. Optimum parameters of the dispersion section can be calculated in
the following way. The phase space distribution of the particles in the ﬁrst FEL ampliﬁer is
described in terms of the distribution function f (P, ψ) written in ”energy-phase” variables
P = E − E0 and ψ = kwz + ωopt(z/c − t), where E0 is the nominal energy of the particle,
kw = 2π/λw is the undulator wavenumber, and ωopt is the frequency of the seed radiation.
Before entering the ﬁrst undulator, the electron distribution is assumed to be Gaussian in
energy and uniform in phase ψ:

f0(P, ψ) =

q

At the exit of the ﬁrst undulator the amplitude modulation is very small, and there is
an energy modulation P0 sin ψ only. Thus, the distribution function at the entrance to the
dispersion section is f0(P + P0 sin ψ). After passing through the dispersion section with a
dispersion strength d ψ/ d P , the electrons of phase ψ and energy deviation P will come to

5

a new phase ψ + P d ψ/ d P . Hence, the distribution function becomes

f (P, ψ) = f0

The integration of this distribution over energy provides the beam density distribution,
and the Fourier expansion of this function gives the harmonic components of the density
modulation converted from the energy modulation [10]:

Here Jn is the Bessel function of n-th order. Assuming the argument of the Bessel func-

P0/

2.72h(∆E)2i is achieved at (d ψ/ d P )max = 1/

h(∆E)2i.

q
During the passage through a long main SASE undulator the electron density modulation
at the optical wavelength can be suppressed by the longitudinal velocity spread in the electron
beam. For eﬀective operation of the optical FEL ampliﬁer the value of the suppression factor
should be close to unity. A calculation shows that this should not be a serious limitation in
the TTF case.

3.2 Femtosecond mode operation

The femtosecond mode operation is based on the experience obtained during the test
runs of the TTF FEL, Phase 1 [1] and it requires one bunch compressor only. An electron
bunch with a sharp spike at the head is prepared, with an rms width of about 20 µm and a
peak current of about 2 kA. This spike in the bunch generates FEL pulses with a duration
below one hundred femtoseconds. An example of the longitudinal phase-space distribution
for a compressed beam including the eﬀect of RF curvature is shown in Fig. 4, where the
longitudinal bunch charge distribution involves concentration of charges in a small fraction
of the bunch length. The longitudinal bunch proﬁle is shown as solid line in Fig. 5. In the
femtosecond mode only the ﬁrst magnetic chicane BC-I will be active, and this will be the
default mode of operation for some time until the 3rd harmonic cavity has been installed in
the injector (see Fig. 2).

The performance of the two-color facility is illustrated for an optical wavelength of 400 nm
and an X-ray wavelength of 30 nm. The bunch proﬁle at the entrance of the undulator is
shown as a solid line in Fig. 5. Simulations show that the value of the slice normalized
emittance in the leading spike is about 7π mm-mrad. An important feature is a pronounced
decrease of the local energy spread in the head of the bunch which can be derived from the
phase space distribution (see Fig. 4). It will be shown below that the combination of high
peak current and low energy spread in the leading spike will result in signiﬁcant shortening
of both optical and X-ray radiation pulses.

The seed laser pulse interacts with the electron beam in the modulator undulator and
produces an energy modulation of about 100 keV in the electron bunch. The amplitude of
the induced beam modulation is less than a percent. Then the electron beam passes through
the dispersion section where the energy modulation is converted to a density modulation at

6

the optical wavelength. The grey line in Fig. 5 shows the bunch proﬁle after the dispersion
section. The density modulation reaches an amplitude of about 20%. It should be noted that
the beam modulation is strongly non-uniform along the bunch. This is a consequence of the
strongly varying energy spread along the bunch, since the bunching depends on the ratio of
the energy modulation to the local energy spread. In our example the dispersion section is
tuned to obtain maximum bunching in the top of the spike. Thus, the seeding is strongly
suppressed in the tail of the bunch.

Upon leaving the dispersion section, the electron beam passes the X-ray undulator where
it produces X-ray pulses (this process will be described below). The electron bunch leaving
the X-ray undulator has a large induced energy spread of about 1 MeV but is still “cold”
enough for the generation of optical radiation. Since the bunch is strongly modulated at
the optical wavelength λopt, it readily starts to produce powerful optical radiation when it

enters the optical radiator resonant at λopt. The evolution of the radiation energy in the
optical radiator is presented in the left plot of Fig. 6. The right plot shows the temporal
structure of the optical pulse at the exit of the optical radiator (at z=4.5 m). The dashed
curve in this plot presents the electron bunch shape. It is evident that the optical pulse
is much shorter than the electron bunch. This is the result of the three factors mentioned
above: the strongly non-uniform pulse proﬁle, the decrease of the energy spread in the head
of the bunch, and the nonuniform seeding modulation. All these factors lead to a very strong
suppression of the lasing properties of the bunch tail. The optical pulse has about 2 GW
peak power, 50 fs FWHM pulse width, and about 100 µJ pulse energy. The installation of
one additional optical undulator would allow to increase the pulse energy to 500 µJ as it
is seen from the left plot in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the optical pulse is completely
coherent, and its spectral width is transform-limited. The transverse shape of the radiation
pulse at the undulator exit and its intensity distribution in the far zone are shown in Fig. 7.

So far we have considered the chain for producing femtosecond optical pulses. Let us now
turn our attention to the SASE process in the X-ray undulator. Although the electron bunch
density is strongly modulated (see Fig. 5), the SASE FEL process in the X-ray undulator
remains almost the same as for an unmodulated electron beam. This is due to the fact that

the cooperation length in the X-ray undulator is much longer then the modulation period
at the optical wavelength. As a result, averaging of the process takes place. Of course, the
output radiation has contents of the sideband harmonic [4], but its contribution to the total
radiation energy is tiny, of the order of 10−4. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the energy in
the X-ray pulse along the X-ray undulator, and Fig. 9 shows the time and spectral structure
of the radiation pulse at the undulator exit. The properties of the radiation pulse are the
same as for an unmodulated electron beam [7]. The peak radiation power is in the GW range
and the FWHM pulse width is about 50 fs. The transverse shape of the radiation pulse at
the undulator exit and its intensity distribution in the far zone are shown in Fig. 10.

These results demonstrate that the two-color scheme for the femtosecond mode of opera-
tion is capable to produce 50 fs long, GW-level optical and X-ray pulses which are precisely
synchronized at a femtosecond level, since they both are produced by the same electron
bunch, and there are no eﬀects which could aﬀect the synchronization.

3.3 Short wavelength mode operation

Operation of the FEL in the short wavelength mode requires the complete chain of the
bunch compression scheme (BC-I, BC-II, and the 3rd harmonic RF section of the injector,
see Fig. 2). The operating range of the accelerator is from 460 to 1000 MeV electron energy.
The longitudinal proﬁle of the electron bunch is shown in Fig. 5. We illustrate the proposed
two-color FEL scheme for an X-ray wavelength of 6 nm (i.e. the minimum project value) and
an optical wavelength of 400 nm (in the middle of the tuning range). The parameters of the
electron beam are: 1 GeV energy, 2500 A peak current, and 2π mm-mrad rms normalized
emittance. Recent start-to-end simulations predict a local energy spread less than 0.2 MeV
[9]. In the present example we use a value of 0.5 MeV for the local energy spread in order
to demonstrate that the proposed pump-probe scheme has suﬃcient safety margin.

The operation of the two-color scheme is the same as it was described above. The electron
beam is modulated in the optical modulator (see Fig. 5). Then it passes through the X-ray
undulator and produces GW-level X-ray radiation pulses. Upon leaving the X-ray undulator
the beam is directed to the optical radiator and produces GW-level optical pulses. The

properties of the optical radiation are illustrated with Figs. 11 and 12. The energy of the
optical pulse exceeds the mJ level, and the peak radiation power exceeds 10 GW. The FWHM
pulse duration is about 150 fs.

The properties of the X-ray pulse are illustrated with Figs. 13, 14, and 15. It is seen that
the properties of the X-ray radiation are the same as for an unmodulated electron beam [7].
Thus, we can state that the two-color facility does not interfere with the main modes of FEL
operation.

3.4 Pulse separation

We demonstrated that the proposed two-color facility is capable of producing GW-level
optical and X-ray pulses which are precisely synchronized at a femtosecond level. These
pulses overlap not only longitudinally, but also transversely if the X-ray undulator and the
optical radiator are in line. In this case the two beams can be separated for pump-probe
experiments by making use of their rather diﬀerent divergence (see, e.g. Figs. 7 and 10). At
some distance from the source the optical beam size will be much larger than that of the
X-ray beam such that a mirror with a hole can be used to separate the beams. Another
possibility is to tilt the undulator axes by about a mrad. In this case the optical and X-ray
pulses are pointing in slightly diﬀerent directions and can be delivered to the sample via
diﬀerent beamlines. The optical transport line to the sample has to include a variable delay
which allows precise tuning over a range of several picoseconds including zero crossing. This
is not trivial since only very small deﬂection angles are possible for the X-ray beam, and
there are other geometrical constraints coming from the existing FEL beam distribution
system. This needs further work and is beyond the scope of the present paper.

4 Conclusion

A novel two-color FEL ampliﬁer for pump-probe experiments has been described com-
bining sub-100 fs optical and X-ray pulses. The properties of the radiation pulses are sum-
marized in Table 2. The proposed facility has unique features: Both pulses have very high
peak power in the GW range. The wavelengths of both radiation sources are continuously

tunable in a wide range: 200 − 900 nm for the optical pulses, and 6 − 120 nm for the X-ray
pulses. Both pulses have diﬀraction limited angular divergence. The spectral width of the
optical pulse is transform limited. Finally and most important, optical and X-ray pulses are
precisely synchronized at a femtosecond level, since they both are produced by the same elec-
tron bunch, and there are no reasons for any time jitter between the pulses. Based on these
unique features a pump-probe facility could be built with unique possibilities for studying
time dependent processes on the time scale of chemical reactions. It is worth to mention that
the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1999 was awarded to A. Zewail for pump-probe experiments
using a quantum laser (40 fs pulse duration) operating in the visible range. The combination
of visible light and X-rays would add the new dimensions of element speciﬁcity and direct
structural information.

A two-color FEL ampliﬁer could be realized at the TESLA Test Facility rather quickly
and with moderate cost expenses for the required components, i.e. a seed laser, two optical
undulators, and a dispersion section The tunable-gap optical undulators would be similar
to insertion devices used at DORIS. Initially one could use a commercially available long
(nanosecond) pulse dye laser with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. This could later be replaced by
an OPA laser system similar to the one currently under development at TTF [3] in order to
operate the system at the full repetition rate of the LINAC.

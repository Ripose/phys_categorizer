Abstract

We solve the Vlasov equation for the longitudinal distribution function and ﬁnd
stationary wave patterns when the distribution in the energy error is Maxwellian.
In the long wavelength limit a stability criterion for linear waves has been ob-
tained and a Korteweg-de Vries- Burgers equation for the relevant hydrodynamic
quantities has been derived.

1 Introduction.

Nonlinear wave interaction in high energy synchrotrons has recently received a great deal of
attention (see e.g. [1], [2], [3]), since it has proven its importance for understanding a variety
of phenomena in high intensity beams.

Perhaps, the simplest problem to study is the evolution in longitudinal direction only of
a intense coasting beam inﬂuenced by a broad-band resonator type impedance. This model
exhibits a surprisingly vast variety of interesting features, part of which have already been
experimentally observed and theoretically investigated [1], [2], [3]. Diﬀerent types of beam
equilibria can be detected due to the collective (nonlinear) interaction between beam particles
and resonator waves, the latter being induced by the beam itself. Solutions describing
similar types of plasma equilibria [Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes] are well-known
in plasma physics [4]. Structures of arbitrary shape can be formed in the nonlinear stationary
regime, which substantially depend on the type of the initial velocity distribution.

It is the purpose of the present paper to apply techniques borrowed from plasma physics
to study nonlinear patterns in coasting beams that are in close analogy with BGK modes.
In sections 3 and 4 we solve the Vlasov equation by expanding the distribution function in
a power series of the resonator potential [5], and in the case of initial Maxwellian energy
error distribution we obtain an equation, describing the evolution of stationary waves on the
resonator. In section 5 we ﬁnd a stability criterion for linear waves in the long wavelength
limit and derive a Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation for the beam density, current velocity
and resonator voltage.

We consider the longitudinal dynamics of a high energy stored beam governed by the set of
equations [2], [3]:

I(θ; T ) =

dvvf (θ, v; T ).

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

The ﬁrst equation (2.1) is the Vlasov equation for the longitudinal distribution function
f (θ, v; T ) of an unbunched beam, while the second equation (2.2) governs the variation per
turn of the voltage V (θ; T ) on a resonator. All dependent and independent variables, as well
as free parameters in equations (2.1-3) are dimensionless and have been rescaled according
to the relations:

T = ωst

Here ωs is the angular revolution frequency of the synchronous particle, ∆E is the energy

I(θ; T ) and the longitudinal distribution function f (θ, v; T ) entering equations (2.1-3) have
been rescaled as well from their actual values Va(θ; T ), Ia(θ; T ) and fa(θ, v; T ) as follows:

3 Solution of the Vlasov Equation.

Let us now try to solve the Vlasov equation by the simple separation of variables ansatz:

Substitution of (3.1) into the continuity equation (2.7) yields:

f (θ, v; T ) = g(v)ψ(θ; T ).

The Vlasov equation (2.1) with (3.1-3) in hand can be further transformed to

Clearly the solution (3.14) is uniquely determined by the generic function g0(v). The
simplest choice is when g0(v) is the Maxwellian (3.4), that is g0(v) itself is an eigenfunction
with an eigenvalue σ−2
of the operator
[c.f. equation (3.4a)]. In this case we immediately

recover the distribution (3.1) with (3.4-6).

5 The Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers Equation.

The exact solution of the Vlasov equation obtained in the preceding sections was found based
on the stationary wave condition given by the continuity equation (3.2). In order to provide
a more general treatment of the problem we introduce the new coordinates and variables
along with the moving beam particles

6 Concluding Remarks.

We have studied the longitudinal dynamics of a high energy coasting beam moving in a
resonator. The coupled Vlasov equation for the longitudinal distribution function and the
equation for the resonator voltage have been solved by closely following the method of
Karimov and Lewis [5]. The key point of this method consists in the representation of the
distribution function as a power series in the resonator potential. Further self-consistent
stationary wave patterns have been found in the simplest equilibrium case of Maxwellian
distribution in the energy error.

9

In the long wavelength (small wavenumber) limit a stability criterion for linear waves
has been obtained and a Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation for the relevant hydrodynamic
quantities has been derived.

An important (and interesting) extension of the results obtained here involves the longi-

tudinal dynamics of a bunched beam. These will be reported elsewhere.

The generation and evolution of nonlinear waves in microwave ampliﬁers such as travelling wave
tubes, free electron lasers and klystrons have been studied. The analysis is based on the hydro-
dynamic and ﬁeld equations for the self-consistent evolution of the beam density distribution, the
current velocity and the electromagnetic ﬁelds. A system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tions for the slowly varying amplitudes of interacting beam-density waves has been derived. Under
the approximation of an isolated mode neglecting the eﬀect of the rest of the modes, this system
reduces to a single nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for that particular mode.

INTRODUCTION

The generation and evolution of nonlinear waves and
harmonic distortions in microwave ampliﬁers such as
travelling wave tubes, free electron lasers (FELs) and
klystrons have recently attracted much research interest
[1, 2, 3]. In connection with the construction and com-
missioning of the next generation of FELs and powerful
klystrons for accelerating RF cavities in circular machines
and linear colliders, this issue has become even more chal-
lenging. Of particular importance are the eﬀects of in-
tense self-ﬁelds due to space charge and current, as well
as wake ﬁelds due to interaction impedances. Both of
the above inﬂuence the propagation of the electron beam
in microwave devices, its stability and transport prop-
erties.
In general, a complete description of collective
processes in intense charged particle beams is provided
by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations for the self-consistent
evolution of the beam distribution function and the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. Usually, the electron beam in a trav-
elling wave tube can be assumed to be weakly colli-
sional. Hence, the dynamics of electrons is well de-
scribed by the hydrodynamic equations coupled with the
equations for the electromagnetic self-ﬁelds, which con-
stitutes a substantial simpliﬁcation of the model. Al-
though the analytical basis for modelling the dynamics
and behaviour of space-charge-dominated beams is well
established, a thorough and satisfactory understanding
of collective processes, detailed equilibrium and forma-
tion of patterns and coherent structures is far from being
complete.

While the linear theory of wave generation in mi-
crowave ampliﬁers is relatively well understood [4], the
nonlinear regime is far from being exhaustively studied.
The present paper is aimed at ﬁlling this gap. We will
be mainly interested in describing the slow evolution of
some coarse-grained quantities that are easily measur-

able, such as the wave amplitudes. Owing to the nonlin-
ear wave interaction contingent on the nonlinear coupling
between the hydrodynamic and Maxwell equations, one
can expect a formation of nontrivial coherent structure
that might be fairly stable in space and time [5, 6]. Here,
we show that solitary wave patterns in the electron beam
density distribution are an irrevocable feature, character-
istic of powerful microwave ampliﬁers.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section,
we state the basic equations which will be the subject
of the renormalization group (RG) reduction in section
III. Starting from a single equation [see equation (20)]
for the density distribution of the electron beam, we ob-
tain a formal perturbation expansion of its solution to
second order. As expected, it contains secular terms pro-
portional to powers of the time variable which is the only
renormalization parameter adopted in our approach. In
section IV, the arbitrary constant amplitudes of the per-
turbation expansion are renormalized such as to elimi-
nate the secular terms. As a result, a set of equations for
the renormalized slowly varying amplitudes is obtained,
known as the renormalization group equations (RGEs).
These equations comprise an inﬁnite system of coupled
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations. Finally, section V is
dedicated to discussion and conclusions.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM AND
BASIC EQUATIONS

The electron beam in a travelling wave tube is assumed
to be weakly collisional. Therefore, the dynamics of elec-
trons is well described by the hydrodynamic equations
coupled with the equations for the electromagnetic self-
ﬁelds. We start with the 1D description of a beam of
electrons propagating in an external focusing electric ﬁeld
with focusing coeﬃcient G, which models the bunching
of the electron beam in the longitudinal direction. As we
will see in the sequel its additional role is to attain a sta-

tionary equilibrium by partially compensating the space-
charge defocusing. The continuity and the momentum
balance equations can be written as

equation (8) can be alternatively expressed according to
the relation

Therefore, we can further scale the hydrodynamic and
ﬁeld variables as

̺ = ̺0 + ǫR, Usc = U0 + ǫU,

v → ǫv, W → ǫW,

(12)
where ǫ is a formal small parameter introduced for con-
venience, which will be set equal to one at the end of the
calculations. Thus, the basic equations to be used for the
subsequent analysis can be written in the form

Before we continue with the renormalization group re-

section, let us assume that the actual dependence of the
quantities R, v, U and W on the spatial variables is rep-
resented by the expression

Equation (20) represents the starting point for the renor-
malization group reduction, the ﬁnal goal of which is to
obtain a description of the relatively slow dynamics lead-
ing to formation of patterns and coherent structures.

Let us proceed order by order. The solution to the
zero-order perturbation equation (20) can be written as

(cid:21)

,
(cid:19)

where

ψk(z; t) = kz − ωkt,

(22)

and Ak is an inﬁnite set of constant complex amplitudes,
which will be the subject of the renormalization proce-
dure in the sequel. Here ”constant” means that the am-
plitudes Ak do not depend on the fast spatial variable
z and on the time t, however, they can depend on the
slow spatial variables ξ. The summation sign in equation
(21) and throughout the paper implies summation over
the wave number k in the case where it takes discrete
values, or integration in the continuous case. From the
dispersion equation

D(k; ωk) = GZk2ω2

k − (cid:3)k

k − k2v2

(23)

(cid:0)
it follows that the wave frequency ωk can be expressed
in terms of the wave number k, where the Fourier-image

where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. The

deﬁned by equation (21) is a real quantity. The zero-
order current velocity v0(z, ξ; t) obtained directly from
equation (13) can be written as

L with respect to ∂z. It has now two types of solu-

the time variable in the ﬁrst-order approximation. As a
rule, the highest power in the renormalization parameter
of the secular terms contained in the standard pertur-
bation expansion is equal to the corresponding order in
the small perturbation parameter. The second solution
of equation (20) arising from the nonlinear interaction
between waves in the ﬁrst order, is regular. Taking into
account the fact that the Fourier image of the operator
Lz is equal to −i(∂D/∂k), we can write the equation for

A couple of interesting features of the zero and ﬁrst-
order perturbation solution are noteworthy to be com-
mented at this point. First of all, the zero-order den-
sity, current velocity (and electric potentials) are pro-
portional to the arbitrary complex amplitudes Ak. The
second terms in the expressions for the ﬁrst-order den-
sity R1 and current velocity v1 [see equations (31) and
(37)] imply contribution from nonlinear interaction be-
tween waves. It will be shown in the remainder that these
terms give rise to nonlinear terms in the renormalization
group equation and describe solitary wave behaviour of
a generic mode.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the generation and evolution of non-
linear waves in microwave ampliﬁers such as travelling
wave tubes, free electron lasers and klystrons. The anal-
ysis performed in the present paper is based on the hydro-
dynamic and ﬁeld equations for the self-consistent evo-
lution of the beam density distribution, the current ve-
locity and the electromagnetic ﬁelds. Using further the
RG method, a system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equations for the slowly varying amplitudes of interact-
ing beam-density waves has been derived. Under the
approximation of an isolated mode neglecting the eﬀect
of the rest of the modes, this system reduces to a single
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for that particular mode.
Since the approach pursued here is rather general, it is
presumed that it may ﬁnd applications to other problems,
where of particular interest is the dynamics of slowly
varying amplitudes of patterns and coherent structures.

Equations (46) represent a system of coupled nonlin-
ear Schr¨odinger equations for the amplitudes of eigen-
modes. Consider a particular mode with a wave number
k. As a ﬁrst approximation, the contribution of the other
modes with m 6= k can be neglected, which results in a
single nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for mode k. The
nonlinearity in the corresponding nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation describes the nonlinear interaction of the mode
k with itself.

It should be emphasized that the approach outlined
in the present paper is rather general even in the the
case of more than one renormalization parameter, where
the extension should be straightforward. Note that the
unique assumption concerns the knowledge of the dis-
persion properties of the linear diﬀerential operator gov-
erning the evolution of the zero-order quantities. The

Abstract

We consider some reduction from nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell equation to rms/rate equations
for second moments related quantities. Our analysis is based on variational-wavelet approach
to rational (in dynamical variables) approximation. It allows to control contribution from
each scale of underlying multiscales and represent solutions via multiscale exact nonlinear
eigenmodes (waveletons) expansions. Our approach provides the possibility to work with
well-localized bases in phase space and best convergence properties of the corresponding
expansions without perturbations or/and linearization procedures.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nu-
merical-analytical technique based on the methods of lo-
cal nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to non-
linear rms/rate equations for averaged quantities related to
some particular case of nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell equa-
tions. Our starting point is a model and approach proposed
by R. C. Davidson e.a. [1], [2]. According to [1] we con-
sider electrostatic approximation for a thin beam. This
approximation is a particular important case of the gen-
eral reduction from statistical collective description based
on Vlasov-Maxwell equations to a ﬁnite number of ordi-
nary differential equations for the second moments related
quantities (beam radius and emittance). In our case these
reduced rms/rate equations also contain some disribution
averaged quantities besides the second moments, e.g. self-
ﬁeld energy of the beam particles. Such model is very efﬁ-
cient for analysis of many problems related to periodic fo-
cusing accelerators, e.g. heavy ion fusion and tritium pro-
duction. So, we are interested in the understanding of col-
lective properties, nonlinear dynamics and transport pro-
cesses of intense non-neutral beams propagating through
a periodic focusing ﬁeld. Our approach is based on the
variational-wavelet approach from [3]-[16],[17] that allows
to consider rational type of nonlinearities in rms/rate dy-
namical equations containing statistically averaged quanti-
ties also. The solution has the multiscale/multiresolution
decomposition via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes
(waveletons), which corresponds to the full multiresolu-
tion expansion in all underlying internal hidden scales. We
may move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest
one to obtain more detailed information about our dynam-
ical process. In this way we give contribution to our full
solution from each scale of resolution or each time/space

scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode. Starting from
some electrostatic approximation of Vlasov-Maxwell sys-
tem and rms/rate dynamical models in part 2 we consider
the approach based on variational-wavelet formulation in
part 3. We give explicit representation for all dynamical
variables in the bases of compactly supported wavelets or
nonlinear eigenmodes. Our solutions are parametrized by
the solutions of a number of reduced standard algebraical
problems. We present also numerical modelling based on
our analytical approach.

2 RATE EQUATIONS

in axial momentum for beam particles we have in Lar-
mor frame the following electrostatic approximation for

where the term K(1 + ∆)/2 may be ﬁxed in some interest-
ing cases, but generally we have it only as average

K(1 + ∆)/2 = − < x∂ψ/∂x + y∂ψ/∂y >

(9)

regarding distribution F . Anyway,
the rate equations
(7), (8) represent reasoanable reductions for the second-
moments related quantities from the full nonlinear Vlasov-
Poisson system. For trivial distributions Davidson e.a. [1]
found additional reductions. For KV distribution (step-
function density) the second rate equation (8) is trivial,
ε(s)=const and we have only one nontrivial rate equation
for rms beam radius (7). The ﬁxed-shape density proﬁle
ansatz for axisymmetric distributions in [1] also leads to
similar situation: emittance conservation and the same en-
velope equation with two shifted constants only.

3 MULTISCALE REPRESENTATIONS

Accordingly to our approach [3]-[16], [17] which allows
us to ﬁnd exact solutions as for Vlasov-like systems (1)-
(3) as for rms-like systems (7),(8) we need not to ﬁx par-
ticular case of distribution function F (x, y, x′, y′, s). Our
consideration is based on the following multiscale N -mode
anzatz:

sion in some high-localized wavelet-like basis:

ΨN (s) =

aN
r φr(s)

(13)

N

Xr=1

We shall determine the coefﬁcients of expansion from the
following variational conditions (different related varia-
tional approaches are considered in [3]-[16]):

LN

k ≡

Z

(LΨN )φk(s)ds = 0

(14)

We have exactly dN algebraical equations for dN un-
knowns ar. So, variational approach reduced the initial
problem (7), (8) to the problem of solution of functional
equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems
at the second stage. As a result we have the following re-
duced algebraical system of equations (RSAE) on the set
of unknown coefﬁcients aN

i of expansion (14):

(15)

i , βJ ),

H(Qij, aN

i , αI ) = M (Pij, aN
where operators H and M are algebraization of RHS and
LHS of initial problem (12). Qij (Pij) are the coefﬁcients
of LHS (RHS) of the initial system of differential equa-
tions (7), (8) and as consequence are coefﬁcients of RSAE.
I = (i1, ..., iq+2), J = (j1, ..., jp+1) are multiindexes,
by which are labelled αI and βI , the other coefﬁcients of
RSAE (15):

Formulae (10), (11) provide multiresolution representation
for variational solutions of system (1)-(3) [3]-[16],[17].
Each high-localized mode/harmonics Aj(s) corresponds
to level j of resolution from the whole underlying inﬁ-
nite scale of spaces:
. . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂
V2 ⊂ . . . , where the closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corre-
sponds to level j of resolution, or to scale j. The con-
struction of such tensor algebra based multiscales bases
are considered in [17]. We’ll consider rate equations (7),
(8) as the following operator equation. Let L, P , Q be an
arbitrary nonlinear (rational in dynamical variables) ﬁrst-
order matrix differential operators with matrix dimension
d (d=4 in our case) corresponding to the system of equa-
tions (7)-(8), which act on some set of functions Ψ ≡
s ∈ Ω ⊂ R from L2(Ω):
Ψ(s) =
,
Q(R, s)Ψ(s) = P (R, s)Ψ(s) or

Ψ1(s), . . . , Ψd(s)

(cid:16)

LΨ ≡ L(R, s)Ψ(s) = 0

(12)

αI = {αi1 ...αiq+2 } =

φi1 ... ˙φis ...φiq+2 , (17)

Xi1,...,iq+2

Z

where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q (12), iℓ =
˙φis = dφis /ds. According to [3]-[16] we
(1, ..., q + 2),
may extend our approach to the case when we have ad-
ditional constraints as (3) on the set of our dynamical vari-
ables Ψ={R, ε} and additional averaged terms (4), (9) also.
In this case by using the method of Lagrangian multipliers
we again may apply the same approach but for the extended
set of variables. As a result we receive the expanded sys-
tem of algebraical equations analogous to the system (15).
Then, after reduction we again can extract from its solu-
tion the coefﬁcients of expansion (13). It should be noted
that if we consider only truncated expansion (13) with N
terms then we have the system of N × d algebraical equa-
tions with the degree ℓ = max{p, q} and the degree of this
algebraical system coincides with the degree of the initial
system. So, after all we have the solution of the initial non-
linear (rational) problem in the form

RN (s) = R(0) +

aN
k φk(s)

N

Xk=1
N

Xk=1

(18)

(19)

where R ≡ R(s, ∂/∂s, Ψ). Let us consider now the N
mode approximation for solution as the following expan-

εN (s) = ε(0) +

bN
k φk(s)

k , bN

where coefﬁcients aN
k are the roots of the correspond-
ing reduced algebraical (polynomial) problem RSAE (15).
Consequently, we have a parametrization of the solution of
the initial problem by solution of reduced algebraical prob-
lem (15). The problem of computations of coefﬁcients αI
(17), βJ (16) of reduced algebraical system may be explic-
itly solved in wavelet approach. The obtained solutions are
given in the form (18, (19), where φk(s) are proper wavelet
bases functions (e.g., periodic or boundary). It should be
noted that such representations give the best possible local-
ization properties in the corresponding (phase)space/time
coordinates. In contrast with different approaches formulae
(18), (19) do not use perturbation technique or linearization
procedures and represent dynamics via generalized nonlin-
ear localized eigenmodes expansion. Our N mode con-

where Ri(s), εj(s) are represented by some family of
(nonlinear) eigenmodes and gives the full multiresolu-
tion/multiscale representation in the high-localized wavelet
bases. The corresponding decomposition is presented on

Fig. 2 and two-dimensional localized mode (waveleton)
contribution to distribution function is presented on Fig.1.
As a result we can construct different (stable) patterns from
high-localized (coherent) structures in spatially-extended
stochastic systems with complex collective behaviour.

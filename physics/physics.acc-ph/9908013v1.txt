Both the classical and quantum approximate invariants are found for
the nonlinear time-dependent oscillator of sextupole transverse betatron
dynamics. They are represented in terms of the elements of a Lie algebra
associated with powers of phase space coordinates. The ﬁrst order
quantum correction to the classical quasi-invariant is found.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum eﬀects in accelerators have been of interest for many years, [1], [2],
and [3]; however recently with the development of multi TeV colliders and interest
in large linear colliders, they have become the subject of wide spread research
[4]. The concept of a quasi-invariant has been introduced in [5], and has been
proven useful for representing the properties of nonlinear betatron dynamics. The
quantum version of this invariant is developed, and from it quantum corrections to
the classical results are found. The similarity between the Lie algebras associated
with the classical case and the quantum case are used to obtain the relevant
results. At ﬁrst the classical linear and classical nonlinear cases are studied from
the view point of their appropriate Lie algebras. These systems are quantized, and
the corresponding Lie algebras are used to determine properties of the quantized
systems.

It is well known that the Courant-Snyder [6] invariant is particularly useful
for determining the phase space pattern for the transverse dynamics of a particle
in a storage ring. Using the Hamiltonian for a time-dependent simple harmonic
oscillator, one can obtain the relevant invariant. However, when there are non-
linear contributions to the Hamiltonian little success has been achieved in ﬁnding
invariants.
In order to better understand the behavior of a particle beam, it
is useful to ﬁnd an approximate invariant, which is associated with a nonlinear
time-dependent Hamiltonian. The method used to ﬁnd the quasi-invariant for the
nonlinear oscillator is ﬁrst used in the context of classical dynamics, based on us-
ing the Lie algebra associated with elements obtained from powers and products
of the position and conjugate momentum coordinates. To illustrate the method,
an example is given for the linear system, where the invariant is exact, and the
relevant algebra is SU(1,1) [7]. The method used for the linear system can be
easily generalized to study a nonlinear one dimensional system. The method has
the advantage that the time-dependent coeﬃcients of the approximate invariant
are found as the solution of a system of linear ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations.

For classical one dimensional transverse dynamics, an approximate invariant
associated with a time-dependent Hamiltonian containing a nonlinear sextupole
term is found. Both the Hamiltonian and the approximate invariant can be rep-
resented as linear sums of the elements of a Lie algebra. The invariant is ap-
proximate in the sense that terms of order greater than three, resulting from the
Poisson bracket of elements of the algebra, are neglected. This results in a closed
Lie algebra. The method is extended to quantum operators, and a similar Lie
algebra involving operator elements is found. This is used to obtain the quantum
quasi-invariant. The relation between the classical result is established with the
aid of coherent states associated with the linear time-dependent oscillator.

The Hamiltonian associated with nonlinear betatron dynamics studied in this
paper is a special case of the Hamiltonian for a particle of mass m with the one

The method used to obtain this equation from a covariant formulation of storage
ring dynamic is found in [2] and [8]. This equation is put in dimensionless form

with the transformation to the dimensionless position, momentum, and energy
variables q/q0, p/p0, and H/E0. Here

This allow the results which depend upon the quantum bracket to be expressed in
terms of ˜ǫ. The quantum results, corresponding to various orders of ¯h, are found
with ˜ǫ = 1, and associated classical results are found with ˜ǫ
0, corresponding
0. For applications to betatron dynamics, it is conventional to

These relations can be used to show that the system of linear diﬀerential equations
Eq. (2.13) is equivalent to the system Eq. (2.5). With initial values given for β(t)
and dβ(t)/dt, the system of equations Eq. (2.13) can be integrated numerically,
using Eq. (2.14) and Eq. (2.15).
III. THE NONLINEAR SEXTUPOLE SYSTEM

Next the method described above is extended to the classical case when a
nonlinear term is added to the linear system Hamiltonian. However, in this case
an approximation is made to obtain a ﬁnite closed Lie algebra which contains
seven elements. As an example, one considers the Hamiltonian Eq. (1.2) where
S(t) is the strength of the sextupole term [9]. Now deﬁning functions of a and a∗

IV. THE QUANTUM LINEAR SYSTEM

As a ﬁrst approximation for ﬁnding the quantum limits associated with the
Hamiltonian Eq. (1.2) for transverse betatron oscillations, one neglects the non-
linear multipole contributions and considers for each transverse degree of freedom
a time-dependent harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian

where t (c = 1) represents arc length along an ideal storage ring orbit. The
dynamical evolution of the conjugate quantum operators ˆp = ˙ˆq and ˆq is determined
from the Heisenberg equations

The Courant-Snyder invariant as a function of the quantum operators ˆq and ˆp
takes the form

2 ˆI0(t) = [(w ˆp

˙wˆq)2 + (ˆq/w)2].

To evaluate the quantum correction to ˆI0(t) and to ﬁnd the uncertainties
associated with the operators ˆq(t) and ˆp(t), one must use the appropriate coher-
ent state associated with ˆH(t). This state is the time-dependent generalization
of the coherent state [13] obtained from the eigenstates of the time-independent
Hamiltonian Eq. (4.9). This is the nearest quantum state to the classical state
of the simple harmonic oscillator. The coherent state for a time-dependent simple

operator Hamiltonian Eq. (1.2). Deﬁning operator elements of ˆa and ˆa†, with
[ˆa, ˆa†] = ˜ǫ, as

VII. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The nonlinear time-dependent Hamiltonian for one dimensional transverse
classical dynamics is written in terms of the position coordinate q and the conjugate
momentum p in Eq. (1.2). For this Hamiltonian, the equation of motion is found
from Hamilton’s equations

˙p =

∂H(t)

to be

¨q + K(t)q + 3S(t)q2 = 0.

The classical approximate invariant associated with this Hamiltonian is

I(t) =

β(t)p2 + 2α(t)pq + γ(t)q2
2

+ c1(t)q3 + c2(t)q2p + c3(t)qp2 + c4(t)p3.

The time-dependent functions α(t), β(t), and γ(t) are found from the Eq. (2.5) or
Eq. (2.13), and the functions ci(t) can be found from the diﬀerential equations Eq.
(3.12). These system of equations are equivalent to the system of linear equations
Eq. (3.7).

Numerical results are given which conﬁrm the analytical development in the
previous sections. Periodic solutions for the functions ci(t) allow the determination
of these functions at a ﬁxed point in a lattice with a sextupole nonlinearity. The
values of the functions q and p are determined from nonlinear tracking for the ﬁrst
ﬁve circuits of the lattice. After the jth turn, the quasi-invariant becomes

I(j) = I0(j) + c1(j)g(1, j) + c2(j)g(2, j) + c3(j)g(3, j) + c4(4, j),

For the numerical results, the FODO approximation is used to ﬁnd the lattice
function β(t). This function is derived in Appendix B. The system Eq. (7.7) and
Eq. (7.8) is solved numerically to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients ci(t). The thin lens approx-
imation is used where the lattice is made up of a single thin sextupole element
and identical cells of length L. Each cell consists of a focusing and defocusing
magnet separated by a bending drift magnet. The focal length of the focusing and
defocusing magnets is f , and the phase advance per cell µ is found from

The tune ν is obtained from

where Nc is the number of cells. The maximum value of β(t) occurs when α(t) = 0,

I is shown in Figure. 1. The classical results for both the invariant for the
linear system I0 cm and the quasi-invariant I cm for the nonlinear system are
plotted in Figure 2. as a function of turn number.
It is clearly seen here that
the methods leading to the quasi-invariant produce a more stable quantity than
I0. For the example considered, the values Nc = 4, µ = π/2, L/2 = 8875 mm,

tion, have been used. The initial values q = 0.3 cm, βmaxp = 0 along with the

sextupole function is approximated by S(t) = (se/3)δ(t

It is clear from the Figure 2. that the quasi-invariant is nearly stable.
It
remains this way for increasingly larger number of turns. It oscillates with small
amplitude and with period of 100 turns. The amplitude of the oscillation de-
pends upon the strength of the sextupole nonlinearity, and the period results from
the nearness of the fractional tune to the third integer resonance. Although, the
present quasi-invariant, which includes terms in q and p through third order, be-
comes increasingly unstable for large values of the sextupole strength or large
initial values of the amplitude q, it is clear that the method can be extended to
include arbitrarily higher order corrections which will improve the stability of the
quasi-invariant. The quantum correction associated with the quasi-invariant can
be found from Eq. (4.21) and Eq. (6.14), and for the numerical example being
considered it takes the value

Iqc ≈

(1/2 + ¯q/2(βmaxc1 + c3/βmax))¯h/

Although very small for a hadron collider, it would be more signiﬁcant for a low en-
ergy nonlinear time-dependent oscillator of the type described by the Hamiltonian
Eq. (1.2).

In conclusion, it is seen that the Lie algebra methods used for both the classical
and quantum quasi-invariants provide a useful approximation for the invariant as-
sociated with the time-dependent nonlinear oscillator. For applications to betatron
dynamics, this method provides a complimentary method to the usual nonlinear-
map tracking methods. In addition, the quantum states
is of Eq. (4.19) pro-
vides the connection between the quantum operator for the quasi-invariant and
the classical result when these states are used to form matrix elements of the type
used to obtain the quantum uncertainties Eq. (4.28) and the quantum correction
Eq. (6.14).

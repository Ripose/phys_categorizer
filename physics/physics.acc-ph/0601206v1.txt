Abstract

In many accelerator storage rings running positively charged beams, ionization of
residual gas and secondary electron emission (SEE) in the beam pipe will give rise
to an electron cloud which can cause beam blow-up or loss of the circulating beam.
A preventative measure that suppresses electron cloud formation is to ensure that
the vacuum wall has a low secondary emission yield (SEY). The SEY of thin ﬁlms
of TiN, sputter deposited Non-Evaporable Getters and a novel TiCN alloy were
measured under a variety of conditions, including the eﬀect of re-contamination
from residual gas.

1 Introduction

The electron cloud eﬀect (ECE) may cause beam instabilities in accelerator
structures with intense positively charged bunched beams, and it is expected

to be an issue for the positron Damping Ring (DR) of the International Lin-
ear Collider (ILC). Reduction of the secondary electron yield (SEY) of the
beam pipe inner wall is eﬀective in controlling cloud formation. We have pre-
viously measured the secondary electron emission (SEE) from a number of
technical surfaces and coatings used in ring construction [1], including un-
coated aluminium alloys [2]. Here, we present SEY (δ) measurements, af-
ter various treatments including ion bombardment, on TiCN, TiN and two
diﬀerently-deposited non-evaporable getter (NEG) TiZrV ﬁlms on aluminium
substrates. All samples were produced at Lawrence Berkeley National Labo-
ratory (LBNL).

2 Experiment description and methodology

The system used to measure the SEY is described in detail in [2]. Measuring
techniques included x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and residual gas
analysis (RGA). Sample processing facilities were heating and ion bombard-
ment.

The SEY (δ) deﬁnition is determined from equation (1). In practice equa-
tion (2) is used because it contains parameters directly measured in the re-
tarding target potential experiment.

δ =

Number of electrons leaving the surf ace
Number of incident electrons

δ = 1 − IT
IP

(1)

(2)

IP is the primary current (the current leaving the electron gun and impinging
on the surface of the sample) and IT is the total current measured on the
sample (IT = IP − ISE). ISE is the secondary electron current leaving the
target.

The SEY is measured by using a gun capable of delivering an electron beam of
0-3 keV, working at a set current of 2 nA and having a 0.4 mm2 spot size on the
target. The measurement of the SEY is done while biasing the sample to -20 V.
This retarding ﬁeld repels most secondaries from adjacent parts of the system
that are excited by the elastically reﬂected primary beam. The primary beam
current as a function of the primary beam energy is measured and recorded
each time before an SEY measurement, by biasing the target to +150 V, and
with the same step in energy for the electron beam. A fresh current lookup
table is created with each measurement. The SEY measurement, over the 0-
3 keV range, takes around 5 minutes.

2

In order to study the eﬀect of ion bombardment on the SEY, we used a
micro-focussing scanning gas ion gun (Leybold IQE 12/38). The gun has two
diﬀerentially-pumped beam formation stages that reduce the sample system
pressure compared to that inside the gun’s electron-impact ionization cham-
ber (into which the gas is directly-injected). Ion energies from 250-5000 eV are
possible. Five nines-pure hydrogen or nitrogen gases were used in this particu-
lar set of experiments. In an accelerator, the ions produced by beam ionization
of residual gases, have a spread in energy. In one of the ILC damping ring de-
signs (6 km), the impact energy of the ions is around 140 eV [3]. Our ion gun
is not designed to work below 250 eV; therefore, we have set the energy of
the test ions to be 250 eV. In our setup, the conditioning ions, hydrogen and
nitrogen, are impacting onto the sample surface at an angle of 35 ◦ from the
sample normal, with an ion density of ∼1010 cm−2s−1. [N.B. This rate is 8 nA
on 1” (2.54 cm) diameter sample] The expected species content of the beam,
for an electron-impact source using H2 or N2, is 50% charged (mostly single-
charge diatomic) and 50% charge-exchanged energetic neutrals [4]. However,
the beams will be referred to as ”H+

2 ” or ”N+

2 ”.

The ﬁlms, deposited on 6063 aluminium alloy substrates, are listed in Table.1,
along with their treatment history. The TiZrV NEG ﬁlms were produced either
from an arc-melted cathode (A) or from a sintered powder cathode (B). NEG
ﬁlms prepared by CERN and SAES Getters, Inc. were studied earlier [1].

3 Results, TiCN

This ternary ﬁlm was chosen to be a possible alternative to TiN or NEG
coatings. It is known that as-deposited titanium nitride and carbide have a
δmax around or below 1 [5,6]; however, after deposition and air exposure, the
SEY degrades to such extent that δmax is above 1.5 [1,6,7]. We wanted to test
whether a ternary alloy would have diﬀerent properties when exposed to air
than had the pure nitride and carbide. The results are presented in Fig.1.

Figure 1. SEY obtained on TiCN/Al sample, at normal incidence, after diﬀerent
accumulated hydrogen ion doses.

The SEY curve and δmax of TiCN, as deposited and air-exposed (”as-received”),
and after heating are similar to that of TiN [8]. Short-term recontamination
by residual gas, at a pressure of 5.10−10 Torr, had a negligible eﬀect on the
SEY.

With respect to ion bombardment behaviour, it is known that a glow discharge
(Argon or Nitrogen) (ArGD or NGD) bombardment on technical surfaces will
sputter-clean the surface to such an extent that its SEY will be very close from
the atomically clean surface [9,10]. We can expect that such plasma will also
work on thin ﬁlms. However, a GD is not sustainable in ultra-high vacuum.
That implies a high current of ions impinging the surfaces. It is desirable to
reproduce the impact of hydrogen ions, expected to be created by the circulat-
ing accelerator beam, on the TiCN coating. Hydrogen, of course, was chosen
because it is the highest concentration gas in a baked vacuum environment,
Table.2. However, because the ionization cross section is smaller for H2 than
for CO (mass 28), we also tested the eﬀect of using an analog of this much-
higher mass projectile on the coatings. CO contaminates vacuum systems with
carbon, so equally-massive N2 was substituted. Chemically-active molecules,
like CO, also do adsorption surface chemistry but we expect that this will be a
negligible eﬀect compared to the sputtering energy available in the ion beam.

Fig.1. Even at this low ion energy and dose, the eﬀect of ion bombardment on
the SEY is evident.

XPS-determined surface chemistry showed essentially no changes as a result
of ion bombardment (Figure 2). The SEY is signiﬁcantly more sensitive to
surface modiﬁcation (average escape depth of ”true” secondaries ∼ 1 nm)
than XPS (average escape depth 3-5 nm).

4 Results, TiZrV

The δmax values measured for the ”as received” NEG prepared at LBNL,
Fig.3, are slightly below the values obtained from the earlier-measured CERN
and SAES samples [1], 1.8 versus 1.9 and 2.1, respectively. The SEY values
obtained after a 2 hours thermal activation are similar and slightly below 1.2
[1].

Residual gas re-contamination of the surface was also studied. The sample
was transferred to the higher background pressure of the adjacent load lock

chamber. The load lock was unbaked and the total pressure, with the sample,
was between 2.10−8 Torr and 4.8 10−8 Torr. This pressure was roughly 100
times above the average pressure in the measurement chamber. The unbaked
residual gas composition in the load lock chamber (Table.4) is quite diﬀerent
from that of the measurement chamber, which is dominated by H2 (Table.2).
In reference [1], residual gas exposure was done in the measurement chamber.
In this work, it was done in the higher residual pressure of the load lock
chamber, to speed up the process. Gas exposure, in this work, is listed in ”day
equivalents” of the measurement chamber for easy comparison with the earlier
work [1].

The SEY max of both NEG samples seems to saturate around 1.42 after
40 days equivalent exposure, dashed line in the left upper plot of Fig.3. For
NEG A, there is no diﬀerence between the SEY obtained at 40 days equivalent
and the one obtained at 114 days equivalent (not shown) as well as the SEY

lower left plot in Fig.3. NEG B show a slight evolution between the 20 days

equal to the one obtained for NEG A.

N+
2 ion-bombardment was performed on NEG A. The δmax decreases and levels
oﬀ just below 1.2, Fig.3. H+
2 ion-bombardment was not done on either NEG
sample because hydrogen diﬀusion and embrittlement eﬀects could change the
sample morphology [11,12]. Therefore, the NEG was only N+
2 ion-bombarded.

The NEG A surface chemistry was measured with XPS following the processes
listed in Fig.3. XPS analysis from the as-received state (air-exposed getter
ﬁlm) to the activated state has already be discussed elsewhere [1,13,14]. XPS
results on re-contamination in vacuum has also been documented with regard
to the variation of the SEY [1]. We focus here, instead, on the evolution of the
surface under N+

2 ion bombardment, Fig.4.

After activation, the TiZrV displays C1s carbon peaks at 283 eV and 285 eV

As contamination by the residual gas occurs, mainly by dissociative adsorption
of oxygen on the metallic NEG, the 285 eV peak increases and get broadened
to higher BE. The broadening is due to contribution of a carbon oxide peak,
which can be sometimes be separated from the 285 eV peak. Upon N+

bombardment, surface molecules/atoms are sputtered away and the carbon
and oxygen peak intensities become reduced (O 1s data not shown here).
Atoms may also be lost from the surface by diﬀusion, for example, into hot
NEG. However, in the latter case, the surface chemistry is not changed sig-
niﬁcantly, as evidenced by the lack of chemical shifts in the peaks’ BE. In
other words, the 250 eV N+
2 ions do not simply induce bonds re-arrangements.
Finally, Fig.4, right plot, shows that nitrogen gets implanted in the NEG and
adsorbed. The rather broad spectrum of chemical valence states shows that
the nitrogen is populating at least the outer ﬁve nm of surface.

The XPS Ti peaks (2p1/2 and 2p3/2) do not show changes. However, there was
a slight evolution in the Zr3d, Fig.5. Zr has two peaks, located at 178.8 eV and
181.1 eV BE, 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively. During nitrogen ion bombardment,
the intensity of the 3d5/2 peak diminishes and the spectrum shifts to slightly
higher BE, perhaps indicative of morphology changes

5 Results, TiN

TiN coating is commonly used to mitigate multipacting in accelerator and
storage ring structures [15]. Its SEY properties are rather well known, but not
exhaustively so, for a wide range of substrate material, deposition thicknesses
and processing conditions [1,6,8,16,17]. This sample was N+
2 ion-bombarded
(Fig.6), under conditions similar to the TiZrV samples above. The SEY max
is reduced from 1.5 to 1.1 and is similar to SEY obtained after electron con-
ditioning [1]

The main peaks of the residual gas present in the measuring system during ion
exposure are listed in Table.5. Ar seen in the spectrum could also be released
during ion bombardment of the samples. Ar is also used as a medium gas to
deposit TiN or NEG ﬁlms, and is sometimes implanted. However, XPS did not

of pressure is suﬃcient to release noble gas buried in the ion pump cathode

The N+
2 bombardment removes water, hydrocarbons, and oxygen from oxyni-
tride. Because water and hydrocarbons are a high SEY contaminant, their
removal reduces the SEY [18]. The XPS chemistry of the TiN was monitored
during bombardment and the main result is presented below, Fig.7. As the
surface contamination/oxidation is removed, the Ti 2p and N 1s peak inten-
sities rise. On the contrary, the C 1s and O 1s peaks intensities decrease. The
location of all peaks remains unchanged.

Ion bombardment by a heavier ion (Ar at 500 eV) could introduce N vacancies
[19], and CO2 gas could play this role. Fortunately, in a baked accelerator,
even under the presence of synchrotron radiation, its presence is negligible
compared to hydrogen and CO. No extra XPS peaks, for example due to
interstitial N, were detected in the spectrum after N+
2 exposure. This does not
mean that vacancies weren’t being produced, but they could have been ﬁlled
by the nitrogen coming from the ion beam.

6 Conclusion

TiCN SEY results, as-received and after heating, do not diﬀer from results
obtained on TiN [1]. We expect that, according to the literature, there will
also be no advantage in using a simpler TiC coating [6], because it has a similar
SEY and behavior upon heating. The important part of this study compares
the eﬃciency of 250 eV ion-bombardment with electron-conditioning. Table.6
shows that a few micro-coulombs per mm2 of ions is suﬃcient to bring the
SEY max below 1.3. In order to reach such a value with 130 eV electrons, a
few thousand times higher dose is needed Table.7.

2 vs. H+

It is also not excluded that heavier ions (N+
2 ) are slightly more eﬃcient
in conditioning than lighter ions, at least in the case of TiZrV (Fig.3). For a
dose of 0.96 µC/mm2, the δmax of the TiZrV is already below 1.2. It might
also be interesting to now study the eﬀect of CO ion-bombardment vs. CO
residual gas adsorption. Based on physical sputtering, conditioning should
occur. However, the possibility of surface oxidation by dissociation of the CO
could increase the SEY. Exposure to background CO alone does increase the
SEY [13]; however, there will be competition for the case of H+
2 /CO+ ion-
sputtering vs. CO vacuum recontamination, as is the case for a circulating
positron beam.

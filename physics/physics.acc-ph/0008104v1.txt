Superconducting Superstructure for the TESLA Collider: New Results

Abstract
A new cavity-chain layout has been proposed for the main
linac of the TESLA linear collider [1]. This superstructure-
layout is based upon four 7-cell superconducting standing-
wave cavities, coupled by short beam pipes. The main
advantages of the superstructure are an increase in the ac-
tive accelerating length in TESLA and a saving in rf com-
ponents, especially power couplers, as compared to the
present 9-cell cavities. The proposed scheme allows to
handle the ﬁeld-ﬂatness tuning and the HOM damping at
sub-unit level, in contrast to standard multi-cell cavities.
The superstructure-layout is extensively studied at DESY
since 1999. Computations have been performed for the rf
properties of the cavity-chain, the bunch-to-bunch energy
spread and multibunch dynamics. A copper model of the
superstructure has been built in order to compare with the
simulations and for testing the ﬁeld-proﬁle tuning and the
HOM damping scheme. A ”proof of principle” niobium
prototype of the superstructure is now under construction
and will be tested with beam at the TESLA Test Facility in
2001. In this paper we present latest results of these inves-
tigations.

INTRODUCTION

The cost for a superconducting linear collider can be sig-
niﬁcantly reduced by minimizing the number of microwave
components, and increasing the ﬁll factor in a machine.
Here the ﬁll factor is meant as a ratio of the active cavity
length to the total cavity length (active length plus intercon-
nection). These two conditions become partially fulﬁlled
when the number of cells (N ) in a structure -fed by one
fundamental mode (FM) coupler- increases. Unfortunately
there are two limitations on the cell’s number in one accel-
erating structure: ﬁrstly the ﬁeld ﬂatness -the sensitivity of
the ﬁeld pattern increases proportional to N 2- and secondly
trapped higher order modes (HOM). In order to overcome
these limitations on N , the concept of the superstructure
has been proposed for the TESLA main linac [1]. In this
concept four 7-cell cavities (sub-units) are coupled by short
beam tubes. The whole chain can be fed by one FM coupler
attached at one end beam tube. The length of the intercon-
nections between the cavities is chosen to be half of the
wave length. Therefore the π-0 mode (π cell-to-cell phase
advance and 0 cavity-to-cavity phase advance) can be used
for acceleration. In the proposed scheme HOM couplers
can be attached to interconnections and to end beam tubes.
All sub-units are equipped with a tuner. Accordingly the
ﬁeld ﬂatness and the HOM damping can be still handled at
the 7-cell sub-unit level.

2 REFILLING OF CELLS AND

BUNCH-TO-BUNCH ENERGY SPREAD

The energy ﬂow through cell-interconnections and the re-
sulting bunch-to-bunch energy spread has been extensively
studied for the superstructure with two independent codes:
HOMDYN [2] and MAFIA [3][4]. Negligible spread in
the energy gain, smaller than 6 · 10−5 for the whole train
of 2820 bunches, proofs that energy ﬂow is big enough to
re-ﬁll cells in the time between two sequential bunches; see
Fig. 1. The energy spread results from the interference of
the accelerating mode with other modes from the FM pass-
band. The difference in energy becomes smaller at the end
of the pulse due to the decay of the interfering modes.

erated by the proposed superstructure.

3 FIELD FLATNESS TUNING

The π-0 mode will be used for the acceleration of beam in
the superstructure. Before assembly, each of the four 7-cell
cavities will be pre-tuned for ﬂat ﬁeld proﬁle and the cho-
sen frequency of the π-0 mode. The pre-tuning procedure
is based on measurements of all modes of the fundamental
mode passband. It allows to adjust the proﬁle with accuracy
of better than 2-3 % for a 9-cell TESLA cavity. This error
corresponds to a frequency accuracy of the individual cells
of ± 30 kHz. After the cavity chain of a superstructure has
been assembled and is operated in the linac at 2K, the fre-
quency of each sub-unit can be corrected in order to equal-
ize the mean value of the ﬁeld amplitude in all sub-units
(not between cells within one sub-unit). This ﬁeld proﬁle
correction is possible during the linac operation, since each
7-cell structure is equipped with its own frequency tuner.
The method proposed to equalize the average accelerating
ﬁeld of sub-units during operation is based on perturba-
tion theory, similar to the standard bead-pull method of

L. Maier and J. Slater [5]. At ﬁrst, present ﬁelds of all
sub-units are measured. For that, successively, the volume
of each sub-unit is changed by the same amount (stepping
motor of each tuner will be moved by the same number of
steps) to measure the frequency change of the π-0 mode.
The change is proportional to the stored energy in the sub-
unit of the superstructure. For each sub-unit relative values
can be deﬁned and used to calculate frequency corrections
needed to equalize the ﬁeld. This method has been tested
on a room temperature Cu model of the superstructure -
see Fig. 2- and by computer simulations, see Fig. 3. One
should note that the method requires only one pickup probe
for all 28 cells, and therefore effectively reduces the num-
bers of cables, feedthroughs and electronics needed for the
control.

the frequency of each sub-unit. In order to verify this, the
ﬁeld ﬂatness in a superstructure has been calculated before
and after tuning of the individual cavities. The frequencies
of the cavities have been corrected accordingly to the pro-
posed tuning method. For the frequency of the individual
cells a variation of ± 30 kHz is assumed, based on the ex-
perience with the TESLA 9-cell cavities. The statistics of
10000 calculated ﬁeld proﬁles is shown in Fig. 4. By ad-
justing the frequencies of the individual cavities the ﬁeld
unﬂatness is signiﬁcantly reduced.

ture can be handled at the 7-cell sub-unit level by adjusting

5 HOM DAMPING AND MULTIBUNCH

EMITTANCE

The vertical normalized multibunch emittance at the inter-
action point of the TESLA collider is desired to be 3 · 10−8
m·rad. Simulations of the emittance growth along the
TESLA linac showed, that the dipole modes with domi-
nating impedance (R/Q) should for that be damped to the
level of Qext < 2 · 105 [6]. The interconnecting tubes of
the superstructure allow to put HOM couplers between the
7-cell cavities. Measurements on a Cu model of the super-
structure at room temperature have demonstrated, that the
required damping can be achieved with ﬁve HOM couplers:
three attached at the interconnections and one at both ends
[7]; see Fig. 5. Note that the sum of all listed dipole modes
impedances is almost ten times smaller than the BBU limit.

model of the superstructure. For comparison also the limit is shown, based on beam dynamics simulation.

6 NB PROTOTYPE

A ﬁrst ”proof of principle” niobium prototype of the super-
structure is under construction [8]. The sub-units are under
fabrication and will be vertical tested similar to TESLA 9-
cell cavities. The beam test for the prototype is scheduled
for Spring 2001. It will allow to verify energy spread com-
putations and RF measurements on the room temperature
models. This will include the test of the HOM damping,
the performance of the HOM couplers at higher magnetic
ﬁeld and the tuning method during operation at 2K.

7 CONCLUSIONS

The presented measurements and calculations demonstrate,
that in the proposed superstructure the reﬁlling of cells, the
HOM damping, the ﬁeld ﬂatness and the ﬁeld ﬂatness tun-
ing can be handled. For the ﬁnal prove, that the superstruc-
ture layout can be used for acceleration, a niobium proto-
type will be tested with beam at the TESLA Test Facility
linac.

With respect to a “hot”, non-crystallized beam the synchrotron radiation of a cold crystal-
lized beam is considerably modiﬁed. We predict suppression of synchrotron radiation emitted by a
crystallized beam in a storage ring. We also propose experiments to detect this eﬀect.

At the turn of the century J. J. Thomson introduced
the “raisin cake” model for the structure of atoms [1]. In
this model, the point–like electrons are immersed and cir-
culate in a uniform positively–charged background. One
of the interesting features of this model is the suppres-
sion of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the circu-
lating electrons due to destructive interference. Thom-
son showed, for example, that six equi–spaced circulat-
ing electrons emit approximately 10−17 of the power of
a single electron [2] when travelling at 1% of the speed
of light. As a model for the naturally occurring atoms
of the periodic table Thomson’s raisin cake model was
quickly replaced by the planetary models of Rutherford
and Bohr. However, Thomson’s model is currently ex-
periencing a revival in the context of “artiﬁcial atoms”
(see, e.g., charged particle traps [3], quantum dots [4]
and clusters [5]). Moreover, present–day technology is
very close to producing space–charge dominated struc-
tures that will allow us to use (and elaborate on) the
ideas of Thomson.

In the context of accelerator physics, suppression of
synchrotron radiation by equi–spaced charges was dis-
cussed by Schiﬀ [6] in 1946. However, he remarks that
“. . . it is diﬃcult to see why the equally spaced conﬁgu-
ration should persist”.

In 1985 Schiﬀer and Kienle suggested the possibility
of crystallized ion beams [7], i.e. geometrically–ordered
structures that circulate in storage rings with speeds
comparable to that of light. The spatial order is eﬀected
by the balance between Coulomb repulsion and focusing
forces in the presence of strong cooling. To date there
is no clear–cut experimental evidence for a fast–moving
ion–beam crystal. Nevertheless, taking into account the
eﬀorts invested in such projects [8] as well as the advances
in cooling techniques [9,10], it seems likely that the goal
of producing a crystalline beam will be achieved in the
foreseeable future.
In fact, considering the parameter
regimes in which the experimentalists work, one expects
that the ﬁrst crystalline beams will be one–dimensional
chains of equi-spaced ions, reminiscent of a scaled-up
Thomson atom. Thus, we can now oﬀer a solution to

Schiﬀ’s remark in the form of crystallized beams.

In this note we propose the use of crystalline beams (es-
pecially 1D chains) to achieve suppression of synchrotron
radiation due to beam crystallization. In the rest of this
note we shall discuss these issues and suggest experimen-
tal realizations.

The suppression of synchrotron radiation is based di-
rectly on the ideas of Thomson described above. The
importance of this eﬀect is the potential possibility to ac-
celerate particles to very high energies such that the syn-
chrotron radiation does not limit the ﬁnal energy, even
for moderately–sized accelerators. Currently, this mainly
applies to electrons, since their synchrotron radiation is
about 1013 larger than for protons with the same energy.
Suppose that we have N particles with charge q which
circulate in a plane (e.g. due to a constant magnetic
ﬁeld) with velocity v and radius of curvature ρ. The
power emitted by a single particle is given by [11,12]:

Thus, if P (1)
is a rapidly decreasing function of n, we get
an overall suppression of synchrotron radiation. Examin-
ing equation (3), this is indeed the case for all β and for
large enough N . To show the suppression eﬀect in detail
we plot the suppression factor α(N, β)

as a function of N for βγ = 0.1, 1, 10 (sub-, intermediate
and ultra-relativistic regimes).

The analytical formulas clearly ﬁt the numerical compu-
tations in their range of validity.

At currently achievable magnetic ﬁelds even ultra-
relativistic ion beams emit very little synchrotron ra-
diation power. Hence, the experimental observation of
the suppression eﬀect for ions is very diﬃcult. However,
for ultra-relativistic electrons the synchrotron radiation
power is appreciable. Thus, our theoretical calculations
may motivate experiments on crystallization of electron
beams. In order to experimentally observe the suppres-
sion eﬀect, we suggest two types of experiments:

1. Start from cold electrons at rest which form a cir-
cular chain, and accelerate them such that the crys-
talline order is maintained. The initial crystalliza-
tion may be realized by resistive cooling techniques
[15].

2. Accelerate electrons and apply sympathetic cool-
ing by a fast crystallized ion beam. This is the
inverse mechanism of electron cooling that is used
currently in storage rings [8]. Suﬃciently strong
cooling of the electron beam leads to its crystal-
lization, and hence to dramatic suppression of syn-
chrotron radiation.

Further work is needed in order to evaluate the feasibility
of the suggested experiments.

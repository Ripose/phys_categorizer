A Neutrino Horn Based on a Solenoid Lens

1 Problem

This note considers variations on the theme of a solenoid magnet (i.e., a magnet whose ﬁeld
has axial symmetry) as a lens for charged particles. A related problem has been posed in
[1].

Recall that if a device is to be a lens with optic axis along the z axis in a cylindrical
coordinate system (r, φ, z), then as particles leave the device they must have no azimuthal
momentum, Pφ = 0, and their radial momentum must be proportional to their radial coor-
dinate, Pr ∝ r. Special cases are (1) that all particles have r = 0 at the exit of the device,
which is a focal point; and (2) that all particles have zero radial momentum.

1.1 Particle Source Inside the Solenoid: A Neutrino “Horn”

A neutrino “horn” is a magnetic device whose goal is to focus charged π mesons that emerge
from a target into a parallel beam, so that when the pions decay, π± → µ±ν, the resulting
neutrinos form a beam that has minimal angular divergence.1 Suppose the pions are pro-
duced at the origin, inside a solenoid magnet of uniform ﬁeld B = Bˆz whose axis is the z
axis and whose downstream face is at z = L. Show that pions of momenta

P =

eB
(2n + 1)πcL

,

(n = 0, 1, 2, ....)

(1)

emerge from the magnet with their momenta parallel to the z axis, independent of the
production angle θ (for θ ≪ 1). In this case, the solenoid acts like an ideal thin lens of focal
length L, located at z = L.

Neutrinos from the forward decay of the resulting parallel beam of pions will have a quasi
line spectrum with momenta proportional to those of eq. (1). If the neutrinos are detected
at a distance l from the source, that distance can be chosen so that the various peaks in
the neutrino spectrum all satisfy the condition for maximal probability of oscillation into
another neutrino species prior to their detection.

1.2 Particle Source Outside the Magnet

Consider a point source of charged particles located at a distance D from the entrance to
solenoid magnet of length L and ﬁeld strength B, the source being on the magnetic axis. For
what momenta P are particles with angle θ ≪ 1 with respect to the magnetic axis focused
to a point on axis beyond the exit of the magnet?

1Because of the Jacobean peak in the two-body decay kinematics of the pion, for some purposes it is

favorable to use neutrinos produced at a nonzero decay angle. See, for example, [2].

In both cases, the focusing eﬀect is due to the fringe ﬁeld of the magnet, and not due to
the uniform central ﬁeld. A simple model of this eﬀect (impulse approximation) supposes
the magnetic “kicks” of the fringe ﬁeld occur entirely in the entrance and exit planes of the
magnet. Although this eﬀect can be analyzed by direct use of F = ma, it is helpful to
consider the canonical (angular) momentum of the particle in the magnetic ﬁeld. For this,
you can use either a Lagrangian formulation, or direction calculation via the Lorentz force
law, in which latter case ﬁrst consider dLz/dt = d(r × P)z/dt.

2 Solution

Although this problem can be solved without explicit use of the canonical angular momen-
tum of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld, that concept oﬀers an elegant perspective.
Therefore, we ﬁrst discuss canonical momenta in sec. 2.1, and then comment on the paraxial
approximation in sec. 2.2, and the impulse approximation in sec. 2.3, before turning to the
solutions for solenoid focusing of particles produced outside, and inside, of the magnet in
secs. 2.4 and 2.5. The possibly novel aspect of this note is the discussion in sec. 2.5.1 of a
neutrino horn based on solenoid focusing.

2.1 Conservation of Canonical Angular Momentum

The canonical momentum of a particle of charge e and rest mass m is (in rectangular coor-
dinates and in Gaussian units)

p = P +

eA
c

,

l = r × p,

1 − v2/c2 is the mechanical momentum of the particle, A is the
where P = γmv = mv/
vector potential of the magnetic ﬁeld, and c is the speed of light. The canonical angular
momentum is

q

where r is the position vector of the particle.

One way to deduce the conserved quantities for the particle’s motion is to consider its
Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. If an electric ﬁeld is present as well, with electric potential V ,
the Lagrangian L of the particle can be written [3]

where v = dr/dt is the particle’s velocity. The canonical momentum associated with a
rectangular coordinate xi is therefore pi = ∂L/∂ ˙xi, leading to eq. (2). Then, the Hamiltonian
H of the system is

If the external electromagnetic ﬁelds have azimuthal symmetry, then the potentials V
and A do also. We consider a cylindrical coordinate system (r, φ, z) with the z axis being

azimuthal dependence,

∂H

so the equations of motion (and the identities r = rˆr + zˆz, ˙r = v = ˙rˆr + r ˙φ ˆφ + ˙zˆz) tell us
that the canonical momentum pφ is a constant of the motion (even for time-dependent ﬁelds,

2.2 The Paraxial Approximation

We now turn our attention to the question of lenslike character of a solenoid magnet as a
charged particle moves from a region of uniform ﬁeld to zero ﬁeld, or vice versa.

Inside a uniform solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld B = Bˆz, the trajectory of the particle is a helix
(whose axis is in general at some nonzero radius r0 from the magnetic axis). The radius R
of the helix can be obtained from F = Ma = ev/c × B using the relativistic mass M = γm.
The projection of the motion onto a plane perpendicular to the magnetic axis is a circle of
radius R and the projected velocity is v⊥. Hence,

so that

where P⊥ = γmv⊥ is the transverse momentum of the particle. For a particle whose average
velocity is in the +z direction, the sense of rotation around the helix is in the − ˆφ direc-
tion (Lenz’ law). The angular frequency ω of the rotation (called the Larmor or cyclotron
frequency) also follows from eq. (14):

If the solenoid magnet has length L, then the time t required for the particle to traverse

the magnet is given by

L
Pz/γm
where θ is the production angle of the particle with respect to the z axis. Hence, the
trajectory of the particle rotates about the axis of the helix by azimuthal angle φh as the
particle traverses the magnet, where

In the paraxial approximation the magnetic force that bends the particle’s trajectory into
a helix is a weak eﬀect, in that it depends on the product of the small transverse velocity
v⊥ = v sin θ ≪ v and the axial ﬁeld B.

2.3 The Impulse Approximation

As the trajectory crosses the fringe ﬁeld of the solenoid, the axial ﬁeld drops rapidly from B
to zero (or rises rapidly from zero to B). In this region there must be a radial component
to the magnetic ﬁeld, according to the Maxwell equation

so that

0 = ∇ · B =

Br ≈ −

∂Bz

(as also readily deduced by applying Gauss’ law to a “pillbox” of radius r and thickness dz).
Although the radial component Br of the magnetic ﬁeld is small, it couples to the large axial
velocity vz to give a force Fφ = dPφ/dt in the azimuthal direction that is not negligible. We
can write

1

Hence, the change ∆Pφ in the azimuthal momentum of the particle as it crosses the fringe
ﬁeld is

The impulse approximation is that during the particle’s passage through the fringe
ﬁeld we can neglect the change in its momentum due to coupling with the axial magnetic
ﬁeld. We only consider the azimuthal kick (24). Thus

Pr,out = Pr,in,

Pφ,out = Pφ,in +

Pz,out = Pz,in

(impulse approximation).

(25)
Furthermore, we neglect the change in the transverse coordinates of the particle as it passes
through the fringe ﬁeld.

rout = rin,

φout = φin

(impulse approximation).

(26)

We can connect the impulse approximation with conservation of canonical angular mo-
mentum by noting that a solenoid magnet with (uniform) ﬁeld B = Bˆz has vector potential

(21)

(22)

(24)

(27)

To see this, recall that B = ∇ × A implies that the integral of the vector potential around
a loop is equal to the magnetic ﬂux through the loop; hence, 2πrAφ = πr2B.

The z component of the canonical angular momentum (which is equal to the azimuthal

component of the canonical momentum pφ),

lz = pφ = r(Pφ + eAφ/c) = r(Pφ + erB/2c),

(28)

A = Aφ ˆφ =

ˆφ.

is a constant of the motion for a particle in a solenoid magnet. Hence, we see that the
simpliﬁed impulse approximation that rout = rin plus conservation of canonical angular
momentum implies the form (25).

Additionally, we note that particles which are created on the magnetic axis have lz = 0,
whether they are created inside or outside the magnetic ﬁeld. As a consequence, whenever
such a particle is outside the magnetic ﬁeld region it has Pφ = 0. If it has passed through
a region of solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld, the azimuthal kicks at the entrance and exit cancel
exactly. This results does not depend on the impulse approximation, as it is deduced directly
from conservation of canonical angular momentum.

2.4 Particle Source Outside the Magnet

We consider a solenoid magnet whose axis is the z axis with ﬁeld B = Bˆz for 0 < z < L.
A particle of momentum P and charge e is emitted at polar angle θ1 ≪ 1 from a (point)
source at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, −d1), and so arrives at the entrance of the magnet with spatial
coordinates (r, φ, z) ≈ (r1 = d1θ1, 0, 0) in the small angle (paraxial) approximation, and with
momentum (Pr, Pφ, Pz) ≈ (Pr1, 0, P ), where

The projection of the particle’s trajectory onto the x-y plane is shown in Fig. 1.

The fringe ﬁeld at the entrance of the solenoid gives the particle an azimuthal kick

resulting in momentum

Pφ1 = −

the particle an azimuthal kick resulting in momentum Pφ1 = −eBr1/2c, where
the magnetic ﬁeld is B = Bˆz inside the solenoid. The helix has radius R =
cP⊥/eB. At the exit of the solenoid the particle is at (r2, φ, L) where φ =

the magnetic axis is one half that about the axis of the helix.

axis at half the Larmor frequency (16), the particle’s trajectory is simple harmonic motion in a plane that
contains the magnetic axis [4]. However, we do not pursue this insight here.

When the particle is at the exit of the solenoid, but still inside it, the transverse mo-
mentum vector P⊥2 makes angle β to the unit vector ˆφ, as shown in Fig. 1. The radial
momentum of the particle Pr2 at the exit of the magnet is therefore

.

As the particle exits the magnet, the radial component of its transverse momentum
remains at the value of eq. (38) in the impulse approximation, while the azimuthal component
increases by eBr2/2c over the value of eq. (39) and hence vanishes, as expected since the
canonical angular momentum is zero.

Once the particle has exited the magnet its transverse momentum is purely radial, with
a value proportional to the radial coordinate r2 at the exit of the magnet. This is lens-like
behavior, in that the particle will then cross the magnetic axis at distance d2 from the exit
of the magnet, where

For the special cases of point-to-parallel focusing (d2 → ∞) and parallel-to-point focusing

(d1 → ∞), the solenoid magnet has focal length f given by eq. (42).

This weakly focusing limit is, however, seldom achieved in practical applications of solenoid
magnets as focusing elements.

The results (41)-(44) for thick- and thin-lens focusing can be utilized in a transfer-matrix

description of particle transport through magnetic systems [5].

2.5 Particle Source Inside the Magnet

The case of a source of particles inside the solenoid magnet, say at z = 0, can be treated as
a special case of the analysis in sec. 2.4 in which d1 = r1 = 0. The angle α shown in Fig. 1
is π/2 in this case, so that angle β is

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

The radial coordinate of the particle at the exit of the magnet is

according to eqs. (38) and (45).

This is lens-like behavior (Pr2 ∝ r2) for any length L of the solenoid, with L = nπλ being

the boundary between focusing and defocusing.

For the special case that L = 2nπλ we have d2 = r2 = 0, corresponding to an image of

the source occuring at the exit of the magnet.

Of particular interest here is the special case that L = (2n + 1)πλ, for which d2 = ∞,
Pr2 = 0, and we have point-to-parallel focusing. From Fig. 1 and eq. (48) we see that the
condition for point-to-parallel focusing of a source inside the solenoid is that the particle has
completed an odd number of half turns on its helical trajectory when it reaches the end of
the solenoid. In this case we can say that the focal length of the solenoid lens is just the
length L,

f = L = (2n + 1)π

(point-to-parallel focus, source inside solenoid).

2.5.1 Neutrino Horn: Point-to-Parallel Focus, L = (2n + 1)πcP/eB

A solenoid magnet provides point-to-parallel focusing for particles produced inside the mag-
net, on its axis, with a discrete set of momenta Pn given by

Pn =

P0
2n + 1

,

(n = 0, 1, 2, ....)

where

P0 =

(50)

eB
πcL

.

Particles with other momenta are not brought into parallelism, so that a “beam” formed
by drifting particles that emerge from the solenoid will be quasimonochromatic with the
sequence of momenta given in eq. (50). Figure 2 illustrates trajectories for particles of
momenta P0 and 3P0 in a solenoid magnet.

Figure 2: Concept of a neutrino horn based on solenoid focusing. The pion
production target is inside the uniform ﬁeld region of the solenoid. The fo-
cusing eﬀects of the fringe ﬁeld at the exit of the magnet (at distance L from
the target) act as ideal thin lens of focal length L for a discrete set of particle
momenta, given in eq. (50).

Such a sequence of momenta occurs in the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations over a
ﬂight path l. As is well, known, in the approximation of pure two-neutrino mixing, the
probability that neutrino type (mass eigenstate) i of energy E = P appears are neutrino
type j after traversing distance l is given by

Prob(i → j) ∝ sin2 ∆M 2
ijl
2E

,

(51)

where ∆Mij = Mi − Mj is the diﬀerence in the masses of the two neutrino types. Hence, for
a ﬁxed drift distance l, the probability of neutrino type i appearing as type j is maximal for
the sequence of neutrino momenta (energy)

Pn =

P0
2n + 1

,

(n = 0, 1, 2, ....)

where

P0 =

(52)

∆M 2
ijl
π

.

Thus a solenoid magnet could be very useful in preparing a neutrino beam with a sequence
of momenta such that all oscillation eﬀects are maximal. The potential advantage of such a
beam for the study of CP violation in neutrino oscillations has been pointed out by Marciano
[6], and elaborated upon in [7].

Of course, neutrinos are neutral, so that a solenoid magnet cannot directly aﬀect their
trajectories. Rather, the solenoid magnet would be used to focus π± particles that are
produced in the interaction of a proton beam with a nuclear target that is placed on the axis
inside the magnet. The length l of the magnet should be short enough that most pions of
interest exit the magnet before decaying into neutrinos, according to

π+ → µ+νµ,

π− → µ−¯νµ.

(53)

Because of the low “Q” value of this decay, the direction of the neutrinos is very close to
that of the pions, provided that latter have energies greater than a few hundred MeV. The
forward-going neutrinos carry about 4/9 of their parent pion momentum, so the solenoid

10

system should be chosen with a momentum P0,π equal to 9/4 of the highest desired neutrino
momentum at which the oscillation probability is maximal, i.e.,

P0,π ≈

P0,ν.

(54)

As implied by eq. (53), the solenoid-focused beam would contain both muon neutrinos
and muon antineutrinos, in roughly equal numbers. This has the advantage to studies could
be made simultaneously with both neutrino and antineutrino beams. However, for the study
of CP violation it would be necessary to identify whether each interactions was due to a
neutrino or an antineutrino. This identiﬁcation must be provided by the detector in which
the neutrino interacts.
If the neutrinos oscillate into electron neutrinos or antineutrinos
before they interact in a the detector, the latter must distinguish showers of electrons from
positrons. This diﬃcult experimental challenge can likely only be met by a magnetized liquid
argon detector [8, 9, 10].

When studying the oscillation of muon neutrinos into electron neutrinos, the presence of
electron neutrinos in the beam constitutes the limiting background. Electron neutrinos are
present in the beam due to the 3-body decay of the muons from pion decay:

π+ → µ+νµ, µ+ → e+νe ¯νµ,

π− → µ−¯νµ, µ− → e−¯νeνµ.

(55)

The background of electron neutrinos, compared to the ﬂux of muon neutrinos at a particular
energy, is suppressed when the beam contains only a narrow range of momenta of the parent
pions. This occurs because the muon neutrinos from the pion decay then have typically
higher momentum that the electron neutrinos from the related muon decay. Hence, the
solenoid-focused neutrino beam, with its quasi line spectrum of energies will have lower
electron neutrino content, at least for highest-energy neutrino “lines”, compared to a wide-
band neutrino beam.

A ﬁnal advantage of the solenoid-focused beam is that the magnetic elements are farther
removed transversely from the pion production target, and so can be made more radiation
resistant to intense proton ﬂuxes than is the case for more conventional toroid-focused neu-
trino “horns”. Further, the relatively open geometry of the solenoid lens will permit use of
liquid metal target, as needed if the proton beam has several megawatts of power [11].

The author thanks Ron Davidson for the demonstration that conservation of the canonical

momentum pφ follows from the Lorentz force law.

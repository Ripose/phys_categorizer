Abstract

In this paper we use current and proposed ﬁnal doublet magnet technologies to reoptimise
the interaction region of the International Linear Collider and reduce the power losses. The
result is a set of three new ﬁnal doublet layouts with improved beam transport properties.
The eﬀect of localised power deposition is considered, and its reduction using Tungsten liners.

Introduction

The current baseline conﬁguration of the International Linear Collider consists of two interaction
regions (IRs) and two detectors, with one IR having a large beam crossing angle and one having
a small beam crossing angle. In this paper we are concerned with the small crossing angle layout,
which presents considerable technical challenge, mainly resulting from transporting the outgoing
disrupted beam oﬀ-axis in the ﬁnal doublet. The ﬁrst presentation of the downstream extraction
line optics was made at Snowmass 2005 [1]. This layout was developed for 1 TeV using NbTi
superconducting ﬁnal doublet magnets and assumed that for 500 GeV all ﬁelds would be scaled
down.

The current (baseline) 2mrad design shows unacceptable beam power loss, both in the ﬁnal
doublet and in the extraction line, for some of the beam parameter sets considered for the ILC.
These parameter sets were documented in [2] and are designed to be a set of representative
beam parameters to assure ﬂexibility in case of unexpected practical limitations in achieving
some of the machine goals.

In this paper, we exploit the limits of current magnet technology, as well as technology still
under development, to optimise the 2mrad ﬁnal doublet layout. We present three new ﬁnal
doublet designs, one optimised for the baseline energy of 500 GeV and two for the upgrade
energy of 1 TeV, using as criterion the combined power deposition from charged beam and
radiative Bhabha particle losses and the worst case among the diﬀerent beam parameters.

2 The baseline layout and the magnet technologies

The ﬁnal doublet in the 2mrad scheme is based on a superconductive large bore QD0 magnet
and on a normal conducting smaller aperture QF1 magnet. The two nearby sextupoles for local
chromaticity correction, SD0 and SF1, are also superconductive large bore magnets.
In the
current design, the choice of superconductive technology for QD0 is NbTi and the maximum
pole tip ﬁeld which is assumed to be achievable is 5.6 T.

In this work, we propose to use NbTi magnets [3] with a somewhat larger maximum pole tip
ﬁeld of 6.28 T (accounting also for expected ﬁeld-reducing eﬀects from the detector solenoid and
for a safety margin) and optimise the design separately for the 500 GeV and 1 TeV machines.
We also investigate using Nb3Sn-based technology for QD0 at 1 TeV. In this case, the maximum
pole tip ﬁeld assumed is 8.8 Ts [3]. In all cases, the sextupoles are also required to be large
bore superconductive magnets. At present, NbTi technology is assumed for these with similar
features as in the baseline design, but partially improved parameters. In all three designs, the
shortening of the magnets which these larger pole tip ﬁelds allow result in much improved beam
transport properties as compared with the present design, for both the 500 GeV and 1 TeV
designs. The optimisation procedure is described in more detail in [4].

3 The results of the ﬁnal doublet reoptimisation

The results of the optimisation can be found in table 1 for NbTi at 500 GeV and in table 2 for
Nb3Sn at 1 TeV. The detailed results for the power losses and the magnet parameters for NbTi
at 1 TeV can be found in[4].

Table 1: Quadrupole and sextupole parameters at √s =500 GeV for NbTi. In this table the
sextupole apertures have been reduced to the minimum required for zero-loss transport of the dis-
rupted beam, assuming the worst case among the beam parameter sets, including with transverse
oﬀsets maximising the beamstrahlung radiation.

It was shown that in the case of the 500 GeV machine, all ILC beam parameter sets can
be accommodated with the new design, as long as 3 mm thick Tungsten liners [4] are included
in the design of the vacuum chamber. These liners spread out the showers and reduce the
maximum power density at the location where most losses are concentrated near the outer edge
of QD0 to values lower than the speciﬁed tolerance of 0.5 mW/g.
In the case of the 1 TeV
machine, on the other hand, it was found that while for all cases, the new ﬁnal doublet layouts
signiﬁcantly improve the beam transport properties, a further improvement in gradient, of about
20% beyond that assumed with Nb3Sn, would be needed to remain within the same tolerances
to avoid magnet quenching.

4 Conclusion

This work shows that the layout of the 2mrad design can be optimised at 500 GeV with NbTi
technology to obtain small enough beam power depositions in the ﬁnal doublet. This doublet
now needs to be integrated into the ﬁnal focus system and extraction line. When this will be
done, we will propose that it become the baseline for the 2mrad at 500GeV, with the assumption
that it would have to be replaced at the time of the 1 TeV energy upgrade. In all cases, the
sextupole lengths, strengths and apertures are not fully optimised. Some more work is still
needed here, in view of reducing their sizes and ease their integration with the detector.

A ﬁnal doublet based on NbTi technology does not, on the other hand, provide small enough
beam power depositions at 1 TeV, for several of the beam parameter sets considered. Exploiting
Nb3Sn superconductive technology can however improve the situation considerably. The opti-
mised layout shows far superior power loss behavior than the current 1 TeV machine baseline
ﬁnal doublet, but is still in excess of the quenching limit for the beam parameter sets with the
largest beamstrahlung energy loss.
It was estimated that about a factor 1.2 larger gradient
than that assumed with Nb3Sn would be needed to satisfy the corresponding tolerance in the
QD0 magnet. We expect further R&D in superconductive magnet technology to enable such
increases in maximum available pole tip ﬁeld in the future, which will ease the design of the
2mrad beam crossing-angle layout. An alternative path is to constrain the optimisation of the
beam parameters at 1 TeV with an upper bound on the beamstrahlung energy loss. This would
also be motivated since a very large beamstrahlung energy loss is undesirable for several other
reasons.

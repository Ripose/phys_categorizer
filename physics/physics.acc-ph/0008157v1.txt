Abstract

During the course of the last decade, traveling wave accel-
erating structures for a future Linear Collider have been the
object of intense R&D efforts. An important problem is the
efﬁcient computation of the long range wakeﬁeld with the
ability to include small alignment and tuning errors. To
that end, SLAC has developed an RF circuit model with
a demonstrated ability to reproduce experimentally mea-
sured wakeﬁelds. The wakeﬁeld computation involves the
repeated solution of a deterministic system of equations
over a range of frequencies. By taking maximum advan-
tage of the sparsity of the equations, we have achieved sig-
niﬁcant performance improvements. These improvements
make it practical to consider simulations involving an en-
tire linac (∼ 103 structures). One might also contemplate
assessing, in real time, the impact of fabrication errors on
the wakeﬁeld as an integral part of quality control.

INTRODUCTION

During the course of the last decade, SLAC has been con-
ducting R&D on new generations of accelerating structures
for a future machine, the Next Linear Collider (NLC). The
culmination of this work is the Damped Detuned Struc-
ture (DDS). Since it is difﬁcult to dissipate deﬂecting mode
power without also dissipating accelerating mode power,
this structure achieves high efﬁciency (shunt impedance)
by relying primarily on detuning to produce favorable phas-
ing of the dipole modes to mitigate the dipole sum wake. To
prevent the partial re-coherence of the long range wake, a
small amount of damping is provided by extracting dipole
mode energy through four manifolds which also serve as
pumping slots.

A linear collider is a complex system and detailed nu-
merical simulations are essential to understand the impact
of different random and/or systematic structure fabrication
errors on beam quality. Assuming a (loaded) gradient of
50 MV/m and a length of 2 m, each of the two arms of a 1
TeV in the center-of-mass NLC would be comprised of ap-
proximately 1000 structures. To simulate the effect of fab-
rication errors on emittance growth, one needs to compute
one wake per structure; consequently, there is considerable
interest in performing these computations as efﬁciently as
possible. A typical NLC structure comprises 206 cells. Be-
cause of the large number of nodes, it impractical to re-
sort to standard ﬁnite element or ﬁnite difference codes to
compute the wake. To make computations manageable, the
SLAC group has developed an RF circuit model. Despite
its limitations, predictions have proven to be in remarkable

agreement with experimental results. However, until now,
the wake computations remained too slow to make the sim-
ulation of a full linac practical. In this paper, we describe
algorithmic modiﬁcations that have led to a code achieving
three orders of magnitude improvement over previously re-
ported performance.

2 CIRCUIT MODEL FOR DDS

In an RF circuit model, Maxwell’s equations are discretized
using a low order expansion based on individual closed cell
modes. The result is a system of linear equations that can
conveniently be represented by a circuit where voltages and
currents are associated with modal expansion coefﬁcient
amplitudes. A model suitable for the computation of the
ﬁelds excited by the dipole excitation of a detuned struc-
ture was developed by Bane and Gluckstern [1]. The con-
cept of manifold damping was later introduced by Kroll [2]
and the circuit model was extended by the SLAC group to
include this feature [3]. The result is shown in Figure 1.
The corresponding equations can be put in the form

where f is the frequency and I is a unit diagonal. The
submatrices H, Hx, G and R are N × N where N is the
number of cells ( N = 206 for the SLAC structure). H
and ˆH describe respectively the TM110-like and TE111-like
cell mode coupling, Hx represents the TE - TM cross cou-
pling, R describes the manifold mode propagation and G
describes the TE-to-manifold coupling. The vectors a, ˆa

are the normalized loop currents (a = i/√Cn) for the TM
and TE chains and V is the normalized manifold voltage
at each cell location. Finally, the right hand side b repre-
sents the beam excitation. Since the boundary conditions at
the cell interfaces impose that the TM and TE components
must propagate in opposite directions, only the TM cell
modes are excited by the beam. The dipole mode energy is
coupled out electrically to the manifold via small slots; the
TE component of the ﬁeld is therefore capacitively coupled
to the manifold. Note that the manifold is represented by a
periodically loaded transmission line for which only nodal
equations make sense, resulting in a mixed current-voltage
formulation.

3 SPECTRAL FUNCTION

Computing the wake of DDS structures involves solv-
ing (1) over the structure’s dipole mode frequency band-
with. A longitudinal dipole impedance is ﬁrst obtained
by summing the cell voltages (in the frequency domain)
with appropriate time delays. The transverse impedance
is subsequently derived by invoking the Panofsky-Wentzel
theorem. The circuit approach to wake computation in-
troduces a small non-causal, non-physical component to
the wake w(t) which can be suppressed by considering
[w(t) − w(−t)]u−1(t) instead. The sine transform of
this function, proportional to the imaginary part of the
impedance, is known as the spectral function S(ω).
In
the context of circuit-based wake computations, S(ω) is
a more convenient quantity to compute than the dipole
(beam) impedance.

4 SPARSE LINEAR EQUATIONS

In the DDS circuit model, each cell couples only to its near-
est neighbors. The resulting matrix is sparse and com-
plex symmetric (a consequence of electromagnetic reci-
procity). Computing the spectral function involves solv-
ing a sequence systems of linear equations. At each step
in frequency, the coefﬁcient matrix changes slightly while
its sparsity structure remains identical. In addition, a good
starting approximation to the solution for any frequency
step is provided by the solution from the previous step.

Iterative Methods

4.1
An algorithm suitable for symmetric complex systems
is the so-called Quasi Minimal Residual (QMR) algo-
rithm [4]. This algorithm is a relative of the well-known
conjugate gradient method which seeks to minimize the
· (Ax − b). The QMR algo-
quadratic form (Ax − b)T
rithm minizimizes a different quadratic form; in both cases
the key to rapid convergence is suitable “preconditioning”
of the system Ax = b with an approximate and easy to
compute inverse. Tests were performed with RDDS circuit
matrices using standard incomplete factorization precondi-
tioners; but the results were somewhat disappointing.
It
is believed that with a suitable preconditioner, the method

can be competitive; however, efforts to identify one were
abandoned after a direct technique proved to be more than
satisfactory.

4.2 Direct Methods

Direct algorithms are essentially all relatives of the elemen-
tary Gaussian elimination algorithm, where unknowns are
eliminated systematically by linear combinations of rows.
A crucial point is that the order in which the rows of
the matrix are eliminated has a direct impact on com-
putational efﬁciency since a different order implies dif-
ferent ﬁll-in patterns 1. In principle, there exists an elim-
ination order that minimizes ﬁll-in, which is not the same
as the most numerically stable ordering. In some cases, it
is even possible to ﬁnd an ordering that produces no ﬁll-
in at all. Although the determination of a truly optimal
ordering is an NP-complete problem, it is possible using
practical strategies to ﬁnd orderings that result in signiﬁ-
cant computational savings. The most successful class of
ordering strategies are so-called “local” strategies that seek
to minimize ﬁll-in at each step in the elimination process
regardless of their impact at a later stage.

The Markowitz Algorithm A good local ordering
strategy is the Markowitz algorithm. Suppose Gaussian
elimination has proceeded through the ﬁrst k stages. For
each row i in the active (n − k) × (n − k) submatrix, let
r(k)
be the
i
number of entries in column j. The Markowitz criterion is
to select as pivot the entry a(k)
from the (n − k) × (n − k)
submatrix that satisﬁes

denote the number of entries. Similarly, let c(k)

j

ij

min
i,j

i − 1)(c(k)
(r(k)

j − 1)

(2)

Using this entry as the pivot causes (r(k)
j − 1)
entry modiﬁcations at step k. Not all these modiﬁcations
will result in ﬁll-in; therefore, the Markowitz criterion is
actually an approximation to the choice of pivot which in-
troduces the least ﬁll-in.

i − 1)(c(k)

5 CODE DESCRIPTION

Our code is based on the spectral function method and uses
Markowitz ordering to solve the circuit equations in the fre-
quency domain. Compared to the procedure outlined in [3],
the following changes have been made: (1) The manifold
voltage A is not separately eliminated, in order to preserve
sparsity. (2) Once the system (1) is solved, the loop cur-
rents are known and the cell voltages can be obtained by a
simple matrix multiplication. There is therefore no need
to form an inverse[5].

1The elimination process creates non-zero entries at positions which
correspond to zeros in the original coefﬁcient matrix. The ﬁll-in is the set
of all entries which were originally zeros and took on non-zeros value at
any step of the elimination process.

Two additional remarks are in order. The process of de-
termining the Markowitz ordering can by itself be time-
consuming; however, since the structure of the RDDS
matrix remains the same at every step in frequency, the
ordering needs to be determined only once. The relative
magnitudes of the equivalent circuit matrix entries do not
change very signiﬁcantly over the frequency band occupied
by the dipole modes. This insures that the Markowitz
ordering remains numerically stable for all frequency
steps.

Implementations of the Markowitz algorithm are widely
available. We used SPARSE [6], a C implementation that
takes advantage of pointers to store the coefﬁcient matrix
as a two-dimensional linked list. To each non-zero entry
corresponds a list node. Each node in turn points to struc-
ture which comprises the numerical value of the entry, its
two-dimensional indices and a pointer to an updating func-
tion. A linked list makes sequential traversal of a row or
a column of the matrix efﬁcient; however, random access
is expensive. To update the matrix at each frequency step,
we sequentially scan the entire list and call an update func-
tion by indirection using a pointer stored within each entry
structure.

The RDDS circuit matrix is not only sparse, it is also
symmetric. The SPARSE package does not exploit this
structure because the standard elimination process destroys
symmetry. We note that the Markowitz scheme can be ex-
tented in a way that preserves symmetry.

6 RESULTS

Our optimized wakeﬁeld code was used to compute the
wake envelope of the RDDS structure, using parameters
provided by SLAC. On a 550 MHz Pentium III (Linux,
GNU gcc compiler) a complete calculation of the wake
takes approximately 14 seconds. This represents a gain of
roughly three orders of magnitude compared to the previ-
ously reported performance and allows the generation of
wakes for an entire linac in less than four hours. Output
from the code is presented in Figures 2 and 3. The results
are identical to those obtained by the SLAC group.

Abstract

We consider space-charge dominated beam transport
systems, where space-charge forces are the same order as
external focusing forces and dynamics of the correspond-
ing emittance growth. We consider the coherent modes
of oscillations and coherent instabilities both in the dif-
ferent nonlinear envelope models and in initial collective
dynamics picture described by Vlasov system. Our cal-
culations are based on variation approach and multires-
olution in the base of high-localized generalized coher-
ent states/wavelets. We control contributions to dynamical
processes from underlying multiscales via nonlinear high-
localized eigenmodes expansions in the base of compactly
supported wavelet and wavelet packets bases.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new
numerical-analytical technique based on wavelet analysis
approach for calculations related to description of differ-
ent space-charge effects. We consider models for space-
charge dominated beam transport systems in case when
space-charge forces are the same order as external focus-
ing forces and dynamics of the corresponding emittance
growth related with oscillations of underlying coherent
modes [1],[2]. Such approach may be useful in all models
in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all compli-
cated problems related with collective behaviour and corre-
sponding statistical distributions to the problems described
by systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equa-
tions. Also we consider an approach based on the second
moments of the distribution functions for the calculation
of evolution of rms envelope of a beam. The rational type
of nonlinearities allows us to use our results from [3]-[14],
which are based on the application of wavelet analysis tech-
nique to variational formulation of initial nonlinear prob-
lems. Wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods,
which gives us a possibility to work with well-localized
bases in functional spaces and give for the general type of
operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
bases the maximum sparse forms. In part 2 we describe
the approach based on Vlasov-type model and correspond-
ing rms equations. In part 3 we present explicit analyti-
cal construction for solutions of Vlasov (besides gaussians)
and rms equations from part 2, which are based on varia-
tional formulation of initial dynamical problems, multires-

olution representation and fast wavelet transform technique
[15]. We give explicit representation for all dynamical
variables in the base of high-localized generalized coher-
ent states/wavelets. Our solutions are parametrized by so-
lutions of a number of reduced algebraical problems one
from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlin-
earity and the others are the linear problems which come
from the corresponding wavelet constructions. In part 4 we
present results of numerical calculations.

2 VLASOV/RMS EQUATIONS

Let x(s) =

x1(s), x2(s)

be the transverse coordinates,
then single-particle equation of motion is (ref.[1] for desig-

(cid:0)

x′′ + kx(s)x − DEx(x, s) = 0,

0, kx(s) describes periodic focusing

force and E satisﬁes the Poisson equation:

∇ · E =

with the following density projection:

n =

Using standard procedure, which takes into account that
rms emittance is described by the seconds moments only

x,rms =< x2

we arrive to the beam envelope equations for σxi:

j > − < xixj >2 (i 6= j),

x1/σ3

where C = qI/πε0mγ3v2
0 but only in case when we can
calculate explicitly < xiEj >. An additional equation de-
scribes evolution of ε2

x1 − C/(σx1 + σx2 ) = 0 (5)
x2 − C/(σx1 + σx2 ) = 0,

xi(s):

(cid:1)(6)
For nonlinear Ei we need higher order moments, which
lead to inﬁnite system of equations. These rms-type enve-
lope equations, from the formal point of view, are not more
than nonlinear differential equations with rational nonlin-
earities and variable coefﬁcients.

3 WAVELET REPRESENTATIONS

One of the key points of wavelet approach demonstrates
that for a large class of operators wavelets are good approx-
imation for true eigenvectors and the corresponding matri-
ces are almost diagonal. Fast wavelet transform gives the
maximum sparse form of operators under consideration. It
is true also in case of our Vlasov-type system of equations
(1)-(4). We have both differential and integral operators in-
side. So, let us denote our (integral/differential) operator
from equations (1)-(4) as T and his kernel as K. We have
the following representation:

< T f, g >=

K(x, y)f (y)g(x)dxdy

(7)

Z Z

In case when f and g are wavelets ϕj,k = 2j/2ϕ(2jx − k)
(7) provides the standard representation of operator T . Let
us consider multiresolution representation

. . . ⊂ V2 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V−2 . . .

The basis in each Vj is ϕj,k(x), where indices k, j repre-
sent translations and scaling respectively or the action of
underlying afﬁne group which act as a “microscope” and
allow us to construct corresponding solution with needed
level of resolution. Let T act : L2(Rn) → L2(Rn), with
the kernel K(x, y) and Pj : L2(Rn) → Vj (j ∈ Z) is
projection operators on the subspace Vj corresponding to j
level of resolution:

(Pj f )(x) =

< f, ϕj,k > ϕj,k(x).

Xk

Let Qj = Pj−1 − Pj be the projection operator on the
subspace Wj then we have the following ”microscopic or
telescopic” representation of operator T which takes into
account contributions from each level of resolution from
different scales starting with coarsest and ending to ﬁnest
scales [15]:

T =

(QjT Qj + QjT Pj + Pj T Qj).

Xj∈Z

We remember that this is a result of presence of afﬁne
group inside this construction. The non-standard form of
operator representation [15] is a representation of operator
T as a chain of triples T = {Aj, Bj, Γj}j∈Z, acting on the
subspaces Vj and Wj:

Aj : Wj → Wj, Bj : Vj → Wj, Γj : Wj → Vj,

where operators {Aj, Bj, Γj}j∈Z are deﬁned as Aj =
QjT Qj, Bj = QjT Pj, Γj = Pj T Qj. The operator
T admits a recursive deﬁnition via

Tj =

Aj+1 Bj+1
Tj+1
Γj+1

,

(cid:18)
where Tj = Pj T Pj and Tj works on Vj
: Vj → Vj .
It should be noted that operator Aj describes interaction

(cid:19)

on the scale j independently from other scales, opera-
tors Bj, Γj describe interaction between the scale j and all
coarser scales, the operator Tj is an ”averaged” version of
Tj−1. We may compute such non-standard representations
of operator for different operators (including pseudodiffer-
ential). As in case of differential operator d/dx as in other
cases in the wavelet bases we need only to solve the system
of linear algebraical equations. Let

rℓ =

ϕ(x − ℓ)

ϕ(x)dx, ℓ ∈ Z.

d
dx

Z

Then, the representation of d/dx is completely determined
by the coefﬁcients rℓ or by representation of d/dx only on
the subspace V0. The coefﬁcients rℓ, ℓ ∈ Z satisfy the
usual system of linear algebraical equations. For the repre-
sentation of operator dn/dxn or integral operators we have
the similar reduced linear system of equations. Then ﬁ-
nally we have for action of operator Tj(Tj : Vj → Vj) on
sufﬁciently smooth function f :

(Tjf )(x) =

2−j

rℓfj,k−ℓ

ϕj,k(x),

Xk∈Z  

Xℓ

!

where ϕj,k(x) = 2−j/2ϕ(2−jx − k) is wavelet basis and

fj,k−1 = 2−j/2

f (x)ϕ(2−j x − k + ℓ)dx

Z

are wavelet coefﬁcients. So, we have simple linear para-
metrization of matrix representation of our operators in
wavelet bases and of the action of this operator on arbitrary
vector in our functional space. Then we may apply our
approach from [3]-[14]. For constructing the solutions of
rms type equations (5),(6) obtained from Vlasov equations
we also use our variational approach, which reduces initial
problem to the problem of solution of functional equations
at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the sec-
ond stage. We have the solution in a compactly supported
wavelet basis. Multiresolution representation is the second
main part of our construction. The solution is parame-
terized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems,
one is nonlinear and the second are some linear problems,
which are obtained from one of the wavelet constructions.
The solution of equations (5),(6) has the following form

z(s) = zslow

N (s) +

zj(ωjs), ωj ∼ 2j

(8)

N

Xj≥N
which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all underlying scales. Formula (8) gives us expansion into
a slow part zslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N.
So, we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the
ﬁnest one to obtain more detailed information about our
dynamical process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of represen-
tation (8) corresponds on the global level of function space
decomposition to resolution space and the second one to
detail space. In this way we give contribution to our full
solution from each scale of resolution or each time scale.

It should be noted that such representations (8) give the
best possible localization properties in phase space. This is
especially important because our dynamical variables cor-
respond to distribution functions/moments of ensemble of
beam particles.

4 NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

Now we present numerical illustrations of previous an-
alytical approach. Numerical calculations are based on
compactly supported wavelets and related wavelet fami-
lies. Fig. 1 demonstrates 6-scale/eigenmodes construction

for solution of equations (4). Figures 2,3 demonstrate reso-
nances region and corresponding nonlinear coherent eigen-
modes decomposition according to equation (8) [16].

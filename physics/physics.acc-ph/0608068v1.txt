Abstract

The equations providing to describe generation process in FEL with varied parame-

ters of diﬀraction grating (photonic crystal) are obtained. It is shown that applying

diﬀraction gratings (photonic crystal) with the variable period one can signiﬁcantly

increase radiation output. It is mentioned that diﬀraction gratings (photonic crystal)

can be used for creation of the dynamical wiggler with variable period in the sys-

tem. This makes possible to develop double-cascaded FEL with variable parameters

changing, which eﬃciency can be signiﬁcantly higher that of conventional system.

1 Introduction

Generators using radiation from an electron beam in a periodic slow-wave

circuit (travelling wave tubes, backward wave oscillators, free electron lasers)

are now widespread [1].

Diﬀraction radiation [2] in periodical structures is in the basis of operation

of travelling wave tubes (TWT) [3,4], backward wave oscillators (BWO) and

such devices as Smith-Purcell lasers [5,6,7] and volume FELs using two- or

three-dimensional distributed feedback [8,9,10,11].

Analysis shows that during operation of such devices electrons lose their en-

ergy for radiation, therefore, the electron beam slows down and gets out of

synchronism with the radiating wave. These limits the eﬃciency of generator,

which usually does not exceed ∼ 10%.

In the ﬁrst years after creation of travelling wave tube it was demonstrated

[4] that to retain synchronism between the electron beam and electromag-

netic wave in a TWT change of the wave phase velocity should be provided.

Application of systems with variable parameters in microwave devices allows

signiﬁcant increase of eﬃciency of such devices [4,12].

The same methods for eﬃciency increase are widely used for undulator FELs

[13].

In the present paper we consider generation process in Smith-Purcell FELs,

volume FELs, travelling wave tubes and backward wave oscillators using pho-

tonic crystal built from metal threads [14,15,16,17]. It is shown that applying

diﬀraction gratings (photonic crystal) with the variable period one can sig-

2

niﬁcantly increase radiation output. It is also shown that diﬀraction gratings

(photonic crystal) can be used for creation of the dynamical wiggler with vari-

able period in the system. This makes possible to develop double-cascaded

FEL with variable parameters changing, which eﬃciency can be signiﬁcantly

higher that of conventional system.

2 Lasing equations for the system with a diﬀraction grating (pho-

tonic crystal) with changing parameters

In general case the equations, which describe lasing process, follow from the

Maxwell equations:

R

1, 2, 3 correspond to the axes x, y, z, respectively.

The current and charge densities are respectively deﬁned as:

~j(~r, t) = e

~vα(t)δ(~r − ~rα(t)), ρ(~r, t) = e

δ(~r − ~rα(t)),

electric (magnetic) ﬁeld in the point of location ~rα of the particle α. It should

be reminded that the equation (3) can also be written as [?]:

The dielectric permittivity tensor can be expressed as ˆε(~r) = 1 + ˆχ(~r), where

ˆχ(~r) is the dielectric susceptibility. When ˆχ ≪ 1 the equation (5) can be

rewritten as:

vector.

P

Let the diﬀraction grating (photonic crystal) period is smoothly varied with

distance, which is much greater then the diﬀraction grating (ptotonic crystal

lattice) period. It is convenient in this case to present the susceptibility ˆχ(~r)

in the form, typical for theory of X-ray diﬀraction in crystals with lattice

distortion [18]:

τ
X

R

ˆχ(~r) =

eiΦτ (~r) ˆχτ (~r),

(7)

where Φτ (~r) =

~τ (~r ′)d~l′, ~τ (~r ′) is the reciprocal lattice vector in the vicinity

4

of the point ~r ′. In contrast to the theory of X-rays diﬀraction, in the case

under consideration ˆχτ depends on ~r. It is to the fact that ˆχτ depends on

the volume of the lattice unit cell Ω, which can be signiﬁcantly varied for

diﬀraction gratings (photonic crystals), as distinct from natural crystals. The

volume of the unit cell Ω(~r) depends on coordinate and, for example, for a

cubic lattice it is determined as Ω(~r) =

1

d1(~r)d2(~r)d3(~r) , where di are the lattice

periods. If ˆχτ (~r) does not depend on ~r, the expression (7) converts to that

usually used for X-rays in crystals with lattice distortion [18].

It should be reminded that for an ideal crystal without lattice distortions, the

wave, which propagates in crystal can be presented as a superposition of the

plane waves:

~E(~r, t) =

~A~τ ei(~kτ ~r−ωt),

∞

X~τ =0

where ~kτ = ~k + ~τ .

Let us use now that in the case under consideration the typical length for

change of the lattice parameters signiﬁcantly exceeds lattice period. This pro-

vides to express the ﬁeld inside the crystal with lattice distortion similarly (8),

but with ~A~τ depending on ~r and t and noticeably changing at the distances

much greater than the lattice period.

Similarly, the wave vector should be considered as a slowly changing function

of coordinate.

According to the above let us ﬁnd the solution of (6) in the form:

~E(~r, t) = Re

~A~τ ei(φτ (~r)−ωt)

∞

(

X~τ =0

,

)

(9)

where φτ (~r) =

~r

0 k(~r)d~l + Φτ (~r), where k(~r) can be found as solution of the
R

dispersion equation in the vicinity of the point with the coordinate vector ~r,

integration is done over the quasiclassical trajectory, which describes motion

of the wavepacket in the crystal with lattice distortion.

Let us consider now case when all the waves participating in the diﬀraction

process lays in a plane (coupled wave diﬀraction, multiple-wave diﬀraction)

i.e. all the reciprocal lattice vectors ~τ lie in one plane [21,20]. Suppose the

wave polarization vector is orthogonal to the plane of diﬀraction.

Let us rewrite (9) in the form

~E(~r, t) = ~e E(~r, t) = ~e Re

~A1ei(φ1(~r)−ωt) + ~A2ei(φ2(~r)−ωt) + ...

Then multiplying (6) by ~e one can get:

For better understanding let us suppose that the diﬀraction grating (photonic

Let us multiply the ﬁrst equation by e−i(~k⊥~r⊥+φ1z(z)−ωt) and the second by

e−i(~k⊥~r⊥+φ2z (z)−ωt). This procedure provides to neglect the conjugated terms,

which appear fast oscillating (when averaging over the oscillation period they

become zero).

Considering the right part of (16) let us take into account that microscopic

currents and densities are the sums of terms, containing delta-functions, there-

fore, the right part can be rewritten as:

that for time moments preceding tα and following Tα the particle α does not

contribute in process.

Let us suppose now that a strong magnetic ﬁeld is applied for beam guiding

though the generation area. Thus, the problem appears one-dimensional (com-

ponents vx and vy are suppressed). Averaging the right part of (18) over the

particle positions inside the beam, points of particle entrance to the resonator

r⊥0α and time of particle entrance to the resonator tα we can obtain:

According to [22] averaging procedure in (18) can be simpliﬁed, when consider

It should be noted that, for example, in the FEL (TWT,BWO) resonator

with changing in space parameters of grating (photonic crystal) the electro-

magnetic wave with depending on z spatial period is formed. This means that

the dynamical undulator with depending on z period appears along the whole

resonator length i. e. tapering dynamical wiggler becomes settled. It is well

known that tapering wiggler can signiﬁcantly increase eﬃciency of the undu-

lator FEL. The dynamical wiggler with varied period, which is proposed, can

be used for development of double-cascaded FEL with parameters changing in

space. The eﬃciency of such system can be signiﬁcantly higher that of conven-

tional system. Moreover, the period of dynamical wiggler can be done much

shorter than that available for wigglers using static magnetic ﬁelds. It should

be also noted that, due to dependence of the phase velocity of the electromag-

netic wave on time, compression of the radiation pulse is possible in such a

system.

3 Conclusion

The equations providing to describe generation process in FEL with varied

parameters of diﬀraction grating (photonic crystal) are obtained. It is shown

that applying diﬀraction gratings (photonic crystal) with the variable period

one can signiﬁcantly increase radiation output. It is mentioned that diﬀrac-

tion gratings (photonic crystal) can be used for creation of the dynamical

12

wiggler with variable period in the system. This makes possible to develop

double-cascaded FEL with variable parameters changing, which eﬃciency can

be signiﬁcantly higher that of conventional system.

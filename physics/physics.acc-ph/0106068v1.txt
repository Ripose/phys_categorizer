Abstract

The PEP-II interaction region is designed to accommodate asymmetric beam
energies, head-on collisions, small bunch spacing and to provide low β∗ for high
luminosity. Local correction schemes are implemented to compensate non-linear
chromaticity from the IP doublets as well as coupling, orbit and focusing ef-
fects from the 6 Tm asymmetric detector solenoid. The main IR optics features
and local correction schemes are presented. MAD[1] code is used for the optics
calculations.

1 IR optics

In the PEP-II asymmetric collider the High Energy Ring (HER) and the Low Energy Ring
(LER) consist of 6 arcs and 6 straight sections[2, 3]. The two rings are vertically separated
except at the interaction point (IP) where the 9 GeV electron and 3.1 GeV positron beams
are brought into collision.

The PEP-II interaction region (IR) optics has to meet the requirement for high luminosity,
provide adequate dynamic aperture and satisfy geometric constraints. The following IR
y = 0.015 m), zero
conditions are applied to attain the design luminosity:
IP dispersion, and head-on collisions. Head-on collisions minimize the eﬀect of synchro-
betatron resonances, though they require a more complicated separation scheme compared
to a crossing angle collision. Maximizing dynamic aperture requires: compensation of the 6
Tm detector solenoid, compensation of non-linear chromaticity produced by the IP doublets,
matching IR optics to the arcs, and maximizing beam separation at parasitic crossing points.
Geometric constraints include: separation of two ring components after collision, providing
0.89 m vertical separation between the LER and HER after the IP, matching the IR trajectory
to the arcs, and ﬁtting the IR components into the existing tunnel.

low IP beta (β∗

x/β∗

The PEP-II IR optics has the following symmetry with respect to the IP: symmetric
longitudinal positions of the ring components, symmetric quadrupole focusing, symmetric
vertical bending, and antisymmetric horizontal bending. The IR focusing symmetry main-
tains the ring symmetry with respect to the IP and allows the IR sextupole correction to be
symmetric. The nominal β∗
y values at the IP for the design luminosity are 0.5 m/1.5 cm
for the LER and 0.667 m/2 cm for the HER. Because of the asymmetric beam energies the
IR optics is essentially independent for the two rings which requires a fast separation of the
two ring components after the IP. The ﬁrst magnets near the collision point are horizontal
separation bends B1 placed at s = ±0.21 m from the IP. The asymmetry in beam energies
is just enough to produce suﬃcient beam separation in the B1 for a zero crossing angle. To
minimize the size of the divergent beams after the IP the LER β functions are focused with
the quadrupole doublet QD1, QF2 placed next to the B1 (see Fig.1). The B1 and QD1 are
the only magnets shared by the two rings. The QD1 produces helpful vertical focusing on
the HER beam as well, and the focusing is completed with a separate HER doublet QD4,
QF5. Besides the ﬁeld gradient the QD1, QF2, QD4 magnets have a vertical dipole ﬁeld on
the reference orbit of one or the other beam to help the horizontal beam separation. As a
result, the two beams are suﬃciently separated at the ﬁrst two parasitic collisions: ∆x = 3.3
mm (11σx) at s = ±0.63 m and ∆x = 18 mm (35σx) at s = ±1.26 m. The QF2, QD4, QF5
are septum magnets to make easier separation of the LER and HER components.

The antisymmetric horizontal bending in the IR allows us to minimize the IR trajectory
excursions by adjustment of the horizontal orbit slope at the IP with respect to the tunnel.
The optimized value of this angle is -16.9 mrad. The vertical separation between the rings
is achieved with a pair of LER vertical bends BV1,2 on either side of the IP. The bends
are placed 2π apart in y-phase and have identical βy to cancel vertical dispersion. One
complication of the IR geometry in the LER is the interleaved horizontal and vertical bends
which cause a tilt of the beam eigenplanes with respect to the mid-plane. Once the IR

magnets are properly aligned to close the ring circumference, the above leads to a small
betatron coupling which has to be canceled.

Besides the vertical bends the IR in the LER accommodates a pair of local sextupoles
to correct x-chromaticity generated by the IP doublet. This requires a −I transformation
between the sextupoles, a minimum x-phase advance between the sextupoles and the doublet,
a high βx/βy ratio and a non-zero dispersion at the sextupoles. A similar requirement for a
high βx/βy or βy/βx ratio is applied to the semi-local sextupoles placed in the nearby arcs
where local β bumps were created. One half of the IR and the adjacent arc in the LER is
shown in Fig.2 where the IP is at s = 0. The HER has similar β bumps in the arcs near the
IR for the semi-local sextupoles, but the IR optics is much simpler compared to the LER.

2 Local and semi-local chromatic correction

In a low β optics the β functions at the IP doublets attain very high values and the doublet
quads are stronger than other ring quadrupoles. This results in two single sources of large
chromaticity. In the PEP-II lattice the two IP doublets make about 20% to 30% of the ring
linear chromaticity. For such a large chromatic perturbation the non-linear part becomes
signiﬁcant. Moreover, the non-linear chromaticity from the two doublets amplify each other,
while in the rest of the ring it tends to cancel out because of periodicity or special phase
advance such as 90o per cell. The chromatic eﬀect of the IP doublets can signiﬁcantly reduce
the momentum dependent dynamic aperture and requires special correction. We refer to a
local compensation when correcting sextupoles are placed close to the IP doublet, and to a

semi-local correction if they are located farther from the doublet in betatron phase.

The method to use the correcting sextupoles is: 1) to place them in a nearby dispersive
region with the phase advance in the corresponding plane of π × integer + ∆µ from the
doublet, where ∆µ is a ﬁne adjustment for optimum correction; 2) to use pairs of identical
sextupoles separated by a −I transformation to cancel sextupole geometric aberrations; 3)
to have large βx/βy or βy/βx ratio at the sextupoles for orthogonal x and y correction and to
minimize sextupole strengths; 4) to have no other sextupoles within each sextupole pair to
minimize octupole-like tune shift with amplitude. It is advantageous to place sextupoles as
close as possible to the corrected doublet to avoid a disturbing eﬀect by the magnets in the
middle. The chromatic eﬀects to be minimized are tune shift with momentum; variation of
β function with momentum at IP, injection point and RF cavities; higher order dispersion
at IP and RF cavities. It is also necessary to keep to a minimum the sextupole geometric
aberrations such as tune shift with amplitude and resonance driving terms. For a better

correction all ring sextupole families have to be optimized. Fig.3 shows how chromatic beta
perturbation ∆β(δ) produced by a doublet is compensated by the opposite beta wave from
a pair of sextupoles.

In the HER the 60o cells allow us to place 2 (x and y) semi-local non-interleaved sextupole
pairs in each arc adjacent to the IR. A local β bump was created in these arcs to increase
β ratio at the sextupoles from 3 to 13. The rest of the HER is corrected with standard two
family interleaved sextupoles SF, SD placed in the other 4 arcs. In the LER the correction
scheme per half IR includes one local pair of x-sextupoles placed next to the IP doublet in
a −I section with non-zero dispersion and high β ratio, and 4 semi-local non-interleaved
sextupole pairs in the arc near IR (see Fig.2). The 90o cells in the LER allow more room for
the sextupole pairs compared to the HER. A β bump in the two arcs increases the β ratio at
the sextupoles from 5.8 to 14. The rest of the LER has 4 non-interleaved pairs of SF1, SF2
or SD1, SD2 sextupoles per arc to correct linear chromaticity. In both rings the correction
scheme is symmetric about IP. The IR local chromatic compensation signiﬁcantly reduces
momentum dependent tune shift and variation of β(δ).

3 Solenoid compensation

The PEP-II detector solenoid has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the beam optics. The integrated
solenoid ﬁeld is 6.07 Tm which rotates the LER beam eigenplanes by 17o. The most part of
the solenoid ﬁeld is located within 4 m near IP with the maximum ﬁeld of 1.5 T. With the
fringe ﬁeld included the solenoid length extends over 6 m. The solenoid ﬁeld proﬁle is shown
in Fig.4. Other complications are: 1) the solenoid center is placed 37 cm from the IP in the
direction of the HER beam; 2) the solenoid overlaps the B1, QD1 and QF2 magnets on both
sides of the IP, hence the ﬁelds are superimposed; 3) neither beam is parallel to the solenoid
axis, and the solenoid is horizontally tilted with respect to the beam orbit at the IP (see
Fig.1). The solenoid eﬀects are: 1) coupling of x and y betatron motion; 2) beam focusing
in both planes; 3) vertical orbit and dispersion caused by the solenoid tilt, and horizontal
orbit and dispersion induced by the coupling.

To model the superposition of the solenoid, quadrupole and dipole ﬁelds in the optics and
tracking codes each of the B1, QD1 and QF2 magnets have been replaced by a combination
of thin lenses with thick solenoid pieces between them. In the hard edge model the solenoid

ﬁeld is held constant, the solenoid pieces are aligned along the beam and the vertical orbit
from the solenoid tilt is simulated with a set of thin vertical kicks. In the sof t edge model the
ﬁeld is a piece-wise function of the longitudinal position, and each solenoid piece is properly
aligned with respect to the beam trajectory. The ﬁeld model is illustrated in Fig.5.

The solenoid correction requirements include: 1) uncoupled x and y betatron motion at
the IP; 2) no residual orbit or dispersion at the IP; 3) nominal β function at the IP; 4)
no optics perturbation outside the IR. With the asymmetric solenoid this implies local and
independent correction on the left and right sides of the IP. In particular, the transfer matrix
from the arcs to the IP must be uncoupled and matched independently on each side of the
IR.

The PEP-II design makes it diﬃcult to use compensating solenoids near the IP to correct
coupling from the detector solenoid, therefore we have adopted a skew quadrupole correction
system[4]. The correction scheme per each half IR consists of: 1) 4 skew quadrupoles to
uncouple the transfer matrix between the arcs and the IP; 2) 2 skew quadrupoles placed in
dispersive regions to correct vertical dispersion ηy and slope η′
y at the IP; 3) 2 horizontal and
2 vertical orbit correctors to correct the orbit at the IP; 4) 8 quadrupoles or more to match

x at the IP. The optimum phases for the 4
skew quadrupoles to correct coupling are [µx, µy] = [0, 0], [0, π/2], [π/2, 0], [π/2, π/2] (mod π)
from the IP. The optimum phases for orbit and dispersion correctors are 0 and π/2 (mod
π) from the IP in the corresponding plane. The following adjustments helped to minimize
the orbit excursions near the IP: 1) solenoid horizontal tilt angle of 20.4 mrad with respect
to the beam trajectory at the IP; 2) vertical displacement of the IP by 3.7 mm; 3) vertical
displacement of QF2, QD4 quadrupoles by a few mm to help orbit correction.

In the existing lattice it is not always possible to ﬁnd the absolutely optimum positions
for all correctors, therefore the coupling, orbit, dispersion and β function corrections are not
completely independent and for exact correction require simultaneous adjustment of all the
above correctors. However, for a small variation of individual optics parameters a smaller
number of correctors can be used leaving practically negligible residual perturbation.

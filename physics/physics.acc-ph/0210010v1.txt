block of ∼2225 kg. The block was installed on rub-
ber balls (∼14Hz resonance) to isolate it from the noisy
ﬂoor of NLCTA. Vibration was monitored by four piezo-
accelerometers and one piezo-transducer was used to mea-
sure water pressure ﬂuctuations. The diameter of each of
the four cooling pipes were 1.9 cm. The ﬂow of water and
the pressure were measured by a venturi tube and by two
manometers installed at the input and output supply.

Abstract

The vibration of components of the NLC linac, such as
accelerating structures and girders, is being studied both
experimentally and analytically. Various effects are be-
ing considered including structural resonances and vibra-
tion caused by cooling water in the accelerating structure.
This paper reports the status of ongoing work.

INTRODUCTION

As part of the R&D effort for the Next Linear Collider
(NLC), an extensive program has been started to study the
vibration induced by cooling water on the NLC Linac and
Final Focus components.

An adequate ﬂow of cooling water to the accelerating
structures is required in order to dissipate the heat load
caused by the absorption of RF power and to maintain
the structure at the designated operating temperature. This
ﬂow may cause vibration of the structure and its support-
ing girder. The acceptable tolerance for vibration of the
structure itself is rather loose – of the order of several mi-
crometers. The concern is that this vibration can couple to
the linac quadrupoles either via the beampipe with its bel-
lows or via the supports. The vertical vibration tolerance
for the linac quadrupoles is about 10 nm.

In this paper we focus on vibration of accelerating RF
structure and girder induced by cooling water. Further pa-
pers will report on vibration coupling to quadrupoles [1]
and on investigation of additional girder damping [2].

2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

For the vibration studies presented, an NLC design ac-
celerating structure [3] was used. This structure is 1.8 m
long and is supported by a “strongback” of the same length.
In the design it was assumed that 3 such structures would
be mounted on a single 6 m long girder. The required water
ﬂow is about ∼1 ℓ/s for each structure. It should be noted
that the NLC currently plans to use shorter RF structures
than the one studied [4].

In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we measured the vibra-
tion induced by different ﬂow rates passing through the
structure-girder system, as shown in Figure 1. The wa-
ter was supplied from the NLC Test Accelerator (NLCTA)
area. The 1.8 m long RF structure (∼100 Kg) was mounted
on a hollow aluminum girder connected to a concrete

NLCTA area.

The second set of experiments were designed to study
the vibration caused only by internal turbulence. The
structure-girder was installed in a much quieter place on the
ﬂoor of the SLD collider hall and the water was gravity-fed
from a tank located ∼18 m higher. The structure-girder was
bolted to a ∼26T concrete block placed on a rubber mat
(∼30Hz resonance). The maximum water ﬂow through the
structure was limited to about 1.1 ℓ/s.

In each experiment, it was possible to feed the water to
the structure either by using the 4 tubes separately or by
feeding only 2 tubes on one end which were then connected
to the adjacent tubes at the other end. In the latter case, the
ﬂow in 2 tubes was in the opposite direction. In all the tests,
only vertical vibrations were studied.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The ﬁrst results were obtained when the structure was
supplied by water from the NLCTA supply system (Fig.1).
Fig.2 shows the variation of the integrated displacement
spectrum when the structure is fed with different water
ﬂows, including no ﬂow.
In the case without ﬂow, both
supply and return valves were closed. In the case with ﬂow,

the supply valve was partially closed to regulate the ﬂow.
Fig.3 shows the average value of the integrated displace-
ment above 10Hz, for different water ﬂow rates.

Fig.4 shows the integrated displacement of the different
elements of the system for a ﬂow of ∼1.9 ℓ/s (twice nomi-
nal). One can see that the maximum amplitude of the dis-
placement comes from the peak at ∼ 52Hz which is be-
lieved to be a resonance of the hollow aluminium girder
and RF structure assembly. The 52Hz resonance is also
seen in the motion of the concrete block, due to coupling
of the structure vibration to the block.

The integrated displacement of the structure at maxi-
mum ﬂow is about 0.5 µm (see Fig.3 and 4), while it is
less than 0.08 µm when no water ﬂows through the struc-
ture. The rms amplitude of vibration depends only slowly
on the ﬂow rate – a 10-fold change in the ﬂow increases the
vibration by only about a factor of 2. Note that the system
considered is above the turbulence threshold (Re>2000) if
the ﬂow > 0.1 ℓ/s, i.e. practically in all the observed range.
Such a slow dependence is explained if one assumes that in
the NLCTA setup, the structure vibrations were due mostly
to turbulence in the water supply system and hence to pres-
sure ﬂuctuations in the incoming water. This assumption
is conﬁrmed by Fig.5 which shows that merely opening ei-
ther supply or return valve, with the other valve closed, pro-
duced an integrated displacement of 0.4 µm, almost equal
to the maximum displacement observed.

Quantitatively, the incoming water can be characterized
by the spectrum of its pressure ﬂuctuations. The integrated
spectrum was measured by a pressure piezo-transducer in
the NLCTA setup as shown in Fig.7. The incoming pres-
sure causes vibration of the RF structure through the force
it exerts on the unbalanced surface of the cooling pipes
(usually equal to cross-section of the pipe). It is interesting
to note that the spectrum of the incoming NLCTA water is
rather smooth and does not contain sharp peaks typically
associated with the rotational frequencies of pumps. This
indicates that the turbulence itself, and not the pumps, was
the cause of the pressure ﬂuctuations.

From the results obtained with a normal cooling water
system, such as the one used in NLCTA, it is clear that
vibrations are caused mostly by the turbulence of the in-
coming water, and not by irrevocable internal turbulence in
the accelerating structure itself. To study the latter, the sys-
tem was moved to the ﬂoor of the SLD detector hall, and
fed with “quiet” water coming from a tank at about ∼18 m
height. The maximum ﬂow obtained in this conﬁguration
was ∼1.1 ℓ/s (equal to the nominal ﬂow).

Figure 6 shows the variation of the displacement with
and without ﬂow obtained in the “gravity fed” experiment.
The RF structure vibration is ∼0.18 µm in this case, i.e.
about a factor of 2 smaller than in the NLCTA setup. The
pressure transducer shows that ﬂuctuations in the gravity

also measured and found to be about 6 nm, which is toler-
able for NLC. Ongoing work on optimization of the design
and on increasing structural damping [8] is expected to fur-
ther reduce the coupling of vibration to the quadrupoles.

4 CONCLUSION

Cooling water can cause vibration of the accelerating
structure both through internal turbulence in the cooling
pipes in the structure, and through pressure ﬂuctuations in
the supply water (external turbulence). The latter does not
depend on the ﬂow rate through the structure and can be the
dominant source of vibration in practical situations. For the
case studied, mechanical resonances of the structure-girder
assembly explain the measured amplitudes. Vibration cou-
pling to a quadrupole was found to be adequately small.
Optimization of design and increased mechanical damping
is expected to further reduce vibration.

fed incoming water are much smaller than in the NLCTA
setup. It is believed that this structure vibration was domi-
nated by internal turbulence.

While the dependence of vibration on ﬂow in the grav-
ity fed experiment has not yet been measured, a semi-
analytical model [5] has been developed which predicts
that the amplitude will depend on the ﬂow approximately
as f low2.5 (see Fig.8). It is interesting to compare this pre-
dictions with estimations from [6] where the amplitude of
vibration caused by internal turbulence almost does not de-
pend on the ﬂow (the dependence is only as 1/f low1/8).

The model used [5] is based on analytical or measured
mode-shape functions of structural resonances for the sys-
tem considered, as well as on empirical models of power
spectrum and spatial coherence properties of pressure ﬂuc-
tuations in turbulent water [7]. For nominal ﬂow, the model
predicts ∼180 nm amplitude which is in good agreement
with the gravity fed experimental data, while for twice the
nominal ﬂow its prediction is higher than even what was
measured in NLCTA. It is worth noting that most of pa-
rameters of the model (including quality factor of the reso-
nance) are difﬁcult to predict analytically. Therefore, cau-
tion is required in extending any such model to a different
system or parameter range.

Island Resonances

George Parzen

May 31, 2011

Abstract

Resonances driven by the error ﬁeld multipoles in the magnets
often show themselves as islands in phase plots of the particle motion.
In order to be able to measure the strength of the island resonance,
and then to correct it, it is helpful to study how these resonances
show themselves. In particular , one can study how the presence of
the island resonances distort the tune dependence on the amplitude,
and the emittance growth caused by the island resonance. Islands in 4-
dimensional phase space, unlike islands in 2-dimensional phase space,
are not easy to visualize. This study will show how to visualize the
islands in 4-dimensional phase space by studying the tune dependence
on the amplitude of the particle. These eﬀects are to some extent
measureable, and can lead to a way to correct the resonance.

Introduction

Resonances driven by the error ﬁeld multipoles often show themselves as
islands in phase plots of the particle motion. This happens when there is
another non-linear ﬁeld present, besides the error ﬁeld multipoles, which
produces a strong enough dependence of the tune on the amplitude of the
particle motion. Non-linear ﬁelds that produce a dependence of the tune
on the ampliude can be the quadrupole fringe ﬁeld , space charge ﬁelds and
octupole correctors. In some cases it may be advantageous to introduce a
non-linear ﬁeld that produces a dependence of the tune on the amplitude
of the particle motion. In order to be able to measure the strength of the
island resonance, and then to correct it, it is helpful to study how these
resonances show themselves. In particular , one can study how the presence

of the island resonances distort the tune dependence on the amplitude and
the emittance growth caused by the island resonance. These eﬀects are to
some extent measureable, and can lead to a way to correct the resonance.
Islands in 4-dimensional phase space, unlike islands in 2-dimensional phase
space, are not easy to visualize. This study will show how to visualize the
islands in 4-dimensional phase space by studying the tune dependence on the
amplitude of the particle. Again, this eﬀect is to some extent measureable,
and can lead to a way to measure the strength of the resonance.

Resonances in 2-dimenional phase space

This section will study an island resonance in 2-dimensional phase space, the
3νx = 19 resonance in the storage ring of the SNS (Spallation Neutron Source
at Oak Ridge). This resonance is driven by the random error sextupole, b2,
in the magnets. In the absence of space charge forces, a non-linear ﬁeld that
produces an appreciable tune dependence on the amplitude of the particle
motion is provided by the fringe ﬁeld of the quadrupoles [1], which causes

the tune to increase with the amplitude . Starting with a zero amplitude
tune of νx = 6.3267 , 3νx = 19 − .02, one ﬁnds the phase space plot shown
in Fig. 1. This plot was generated starting with x0 = 24mm, px0 = 0
and then increasing x0 in steps of 2 mm keeping px0 = 0 and tracking the
particle for 1000 turns for each x0. The tune starts below the resonance,
and increases with amplitude. The islands appear when the tune reaches
νx = 6.3333. The islands are reached when the initial amplitude is increased
to x0 = 30mm, px0 = 0, which corresponds to an initial horizontal emittance
of about ǫx0 = 115 mm.mrad.

The distortion of the tune dependence on amplitude is shown in Fig. 2
where the horizontal tune is plotted against ǫx0. Fig. 2 is generated by doing
a search along the px0 = 0 direction, increasing x0 in steps of 2 mm. Fig. 2
shows a ﬂat region where νx = 6.3333 which will be seen to indicate the
region where x0, px0 is crossing the island. When x0, px0 are inside the island,
the paticle motion is doing a slow oscilation around the ﬁxed point at the
center of the island. The particle motion then contains more than one tune,
and the tune with the largest ampltude is the tune of the ﬁxed point, 6.3333.
Inside the island, the tune shown in Fig. 2, is this tune with the largest

4

amplitude. One can verify that the beginning and the end of the ﬂat region
occur at the same ǫx0 which correpond to the borders of the islands along the
px0 = 0 direction. Fig. 2 can be used to ﬁnd the width of the island along
the px0 = 0 direction which is given by the width of the ﬂat region in Fig. 2.
The islands generated by the 3νx = 19 resonance indicate a growth in
the particle emittance.
If one starts a particle inside the islands with the
initial emittance ǫx0, then as the particle moves around the ﬁxed point, its
emittance will change and reach the maximun value of ǫx,max. One can use
as a measure of the emittance growth the quantity

dǫx,max = (ǫx,max − ǫx0)/ǫx0

. dǫx,max is plotted against ǫx0 in Fig. 3. It shows a maximun value for dǫx,max
which can be used as a measure of the strength of the resonance.

The results shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 can to some extent be measured
experimentally to ﬁnd a way to correct this resonance with sextupole cor-
rectors. An interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something
that might be measured is to plot the emittance growth, dǫx,max vs the tune,
νx. This plot can be found by combining Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and is shown in
Fig. 4. In this plot, there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs
when νx=6.3333, the resonance tune. The peak could be used as a measure
of the resonance strength to correct the resonance.

Using the ﬂat region in the tune dependence on amplitude along the
px0 = 0 direction to indicate the strength of the resonance can sometimes
lead to an error in setting the strengths of the sextupole correctors. Changing
the strength of the correctors can cause the islands to move, and the width
of the island as indicated by the ﬂat region in the tune dependence on the
amplitude may, for example, appear smaller because one is now crossing the
island at a place where it is narrower. Also, when the islands move the the
emittance growth , dǫx,max may seem smaller. In order to avoid this error
due to the movement of the islands when the corrector strengths are changed,
one has to measure the tune dependence on amplitude along enough diﬀerent
directions in phase space so that one ﬁnds the largest width of the island and
the largest emittance growth for the x0, px0 inside the island. The same sort
of argument also applies in ﬁnding the emittance growth dependence on the
amplitude. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, results are given found by going out along
many directions in phase space. One needs just enough directions to cover
one of the three islands in Fig. 1. Here 6 directions were used in the region
of phase space covered by one island.

In Fig. 5 that plots νx versus ǫx0, for each ǫx0 there are now 6 points plotted
corresponding to the 6 directions. Points that have the tune, nux=6.3333,
lie inside the island.The width of the island in ǫx0 as given by the width of
the points that lie on the nux=6.3333 line and is much larger than the width
found using just the px0=0 direction as it includes the direction that crosses
the island close to where the island is widest. In the same way, Fig. 6 now
shows the largest emittance growth for the x0, px0 that are inside the island.
In applying the above results to develope a procedure for using the cor-
rectors to correct a resonance, one will probably use a sample of the x0, px0
that is convenient for a particular ring and its injection system. One would
then measure either the tune or the emittance growth of enough particles in
the sample to be able to ﬁnd the width of the island from the tune measure-
ment or the largest emittance growth for paticles in the sample. One has to
have a large enough sample that one is not misled by the movement of the
islands when the excitation of the correctors are changed. To measure the
largest emittance growth for particles in the sample, one can measure the fre-
quency spectrum of the betatron oscillations. Particles inside an island will
have the frequency that corresponds to the resonant tune 6.3333. The largest

amplitude found in the frequency spectrum for the resonant frequency, can
be used as a measure of the largest emittance growth. Something like this
was done at RHIC [2]. The measurements can be done for a weak beam (no
space charge eﬀects) as it has been shown [3] that the resonance correction
for resonances generated by magnet errors in the absence of space charge will
also work fairly well in the presence of space charge.

An interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that
might be measured is to plot the emittance growth, dǫx,max vs the tune, νx.
This plot can be found by combining Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 and is shown in Fig. 7
The correction of the island resonances for the 3νx = 19 example can be
done with two sextupole correctors properly located around the ring.The two
correctors can then be adjusted one at a time, and for each setting of the
correctors, the island width can measured from the dependnce of the tune
on the amplitude as shown in Fig. 5, or the dependence of the amplitude
growth on the tune as shown by combining Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Simulating
this procedure gives the results shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. The emittance
growth ,the maximun depx,max, is reduced by almost a factor of 10 by the
best setting of the correctors that was found.

represent x0, px0, y0, py0, ǫx0, ǫy0, ǫt0, νx0, νy0.

The theoretical result for the width of the island indicates that the width
can be made zero when the correctors are set so that dν30=0 where dν30 is
the stopband [4] of the 3νx = 19 resonance due to the ﬁeld errors in the
magnets that are driving this resonance. According to the theoretical result
the required setting of the correctors does not depend on the ﬁeld producing
the dependence of the tune on amplitude. This result is not useful for setting
the correctors as the errors in the magnets are not known. However, this
result helps to explain why the setting of the correctors in the absence of
space charge ﬁelds will also correct the resonance when the space charge
ﬁelds are present. It was found for the 3νx = 19 resonance that setting of
the correctors to make dν30=0 will only reduce the emittance growth, the
maximun dǫx,max, by a factor of about 3 instead of the factor of 10 found
above. It was found that for the SNS [3] this weaker correction that makes
dν30=0 was good enough to reduce the beam losses due to the resonance and
space charge ﬁelds.

Resonances in 4-dimenional phase space

This section will study an island resonance in 4-dimensional phase space, the
νx + 2νy = 19 in the storage ring of the SNS (Spallation Neutron Source at
Oak Ridge). This resonance is driven by the random error sextupole, b2, in
the magnets. Unlike, the 3νx = 19 resonance in 2-dimensional phase space, it
is diﬃcult to visualise the islands associated with the νx +2νy = 19 resonance
by looking at the particle motion in 4-dimensional phase space. Instead, we
will look at the distortion due to the resonance on the dependence of the
tune and the emittance growth on the amplitude of the particle motion. In
Fig. 10, the spread in total emittance ,

dǫt = (ǫt,max − ǫt,min)/(ǫt,max + ǫt,min)

is plotted against the initial total emittance, ǫt0. ǫt,max is the largest total
emittance and ǫt,min is the smallest total emittance reached by particle with
the initial coordinates, x0, px0, y0, py0, and initial total emittance, ǫt0,tracked
for 1000 turns. Points were found along a particular direction in phase space
given by px0 = 0, py0 = 0 and ǫx = ǫy.The emittance spread becomes large

10

in the region ǫt0=125 to ǫt0=300, and this region may be used as a measure
of the width of the island along this particular direction , px0 = 0, py0 = 0
and ǫx = ǫy. The low value of dǫt near the center of region shows that this
particular direction goes close to the center of the island where we expect
dǫt=0. Fig. 11 shows the emittance growth,

dǫt,max = (ǫt,max − ǫt0)/ǫt0

as a function of ǫt0. The goal of a correction scheme would be to reduce
the maximun value of dǫt,max in ths plot. In the 2-dimensional case of the
3νx = 19 resonance, the plot of νx vs. ǫx0 had a ﬂat region where νx had the
constant value of 6.3333 which gave the width of the island. It was found
for the νx + 2νy = 19 resonance, a ﬂat region would be found if we plotted
νx + 2νy vs. ǫt0 and the constant value in the ﬂat region is νx + 2νy = 19.
This is shown in Fig. 12. The width of the ﬂat region coincides with the
width of the island as found from Fig. 10, which plots the emittance spread
vs. ǫt0. For coupled motion, the particle motion contains more than one
tune, and what is plotted in Fig. 12 is the main tune or the tune with the
largest amplitude.

An interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that
might be measured is to plot the emittance growth, dǫt,max vs νx + 2νy.
This plot can be found by combining Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 and is shown in
Fig. 13. In this plot, there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs
when νx + 2νy = 19. The peak could be used as a measure of the resonance
strength to correct the resonance.

As in the 2-dimesional case, to correct the νx + 2νy = 19 resonance , one
has to repeat the above calculations for all directions in phase space that
pass through a particular island, in order not to be misled by the movement
of the islands when the correctors are changed. These results are shown in
Fig. 14, Fig. 15.and Fig. 16 where for each ǫt0 runs are done for 6 directions
in x0, px0 and for 6 directions in y0, py0. In these ﬁgures there are, then, 36
points for each value of ǫt0. The results indicated by these ﬁgures for the
width of the island and the maximun emittance growth are not too diﬀerent
from those found above where only one direction in phase space was used, as
the particular direction used appears to pass close to the center of the island.
An interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that
might be measured is to plot the emittance growth , dǫt,max vs νx + 2νy.
This plot can be found by combining Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 and is shown in

Fig. 17. In this plot, there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs
when νx + 2νy = 19. The peak could be used as a measure of the resonance
strength to correct the resonance.

The correction of the island resonances for the νx + 2νy = 19 resonance
can be done with two sextupole correctors properly located around the ring.
Assuming that one has a way to measure either the width of the island or
the maximun emittance growth using the above results as a guide , then the
two correctors can be adjusted one at a time to reduce the emittance growth
or the island width. Simulating this procedure gives the results shown in
Fig. 18 and Fig. 19. The emittance growth ,the maximun dǫt,max, is reduced
by almost a factor of 15 by the best setting of the correctors that was found.
In this case, setting the correctors to zero the stopband, dν12=0, reduces the
maximun emittance growth by a factor of 5.

Higher order resonances

In the above, results were presented for the 3nux=19 and the νx + 2νy = 19
resonances. Similar studies have also been done for all four of the third

order resonances mνx + nνy = 19, m + n = 3, and for all ﬁve of the fourth
order resonances mνx + nνy = 25, m + n = 4, with similar results. It is our
expectation that similar results would be found for the higher order resonance
mνx +nνy = q, where m,n,q are integers. In particular, if mνx +nνy is plotted
versus ǫt0, this plot will contain a ﬂat region where mνx + nνy is costant at
mνx + nνy = q, and the width of this ﬂat region will give the width of the
islands associated with the mνx + nνy = q resonance.

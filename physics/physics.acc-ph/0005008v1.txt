Abstract. A focal point for the HEMC’99 workshop was the evaluation of straw-man
parameter sets for the acceleration and collider rings of muon colliders at center of mass
energies of 10 TeV and 100 TeV. These self-consistent parameter sets are presented
and discussed. The methods and assumptions used in their generation are described
and motivations are given for the speciﬁc choices of parameter values. The assessment
of the parameter sets during the workshop is then reviewed and the implications for
the feasibility of many-TeV muon colliders are evaluated. Finally, a preview is given
of plans for iterating on the parameter sets and, more generally, for future feasibility
studies on many-TeV muon colliders.

INTRODUCTION

Self-consistent example parameter sets for the acceleration and collider ring pa-
rameters of many-TeV muon colliders were an important focal point for the discus-
sions at the HEMC’99 Workshop – “Studies on Colliders and Collider Physics at
the Highest Energies: Muon Colliders at 10 TeV to 100 TeV”, held at Montauk,
NY from September 27-October 1, 1999. They served as straw-man examples to be
criticized, ﬂeshed-out and improved upon by the accelerator experts attending the
workshop, and the physics-related parameters helped the experimental and theo-
retical physicists at the workshop in their evaluations and comments on the physics
potential of such colliders.

Three acceleration and collider parameter sets were used at HEMC’99: one at a
center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV (set A) and two at 100 TeV (sets B and C). The
collider ring and accelerator parameters are presented in tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Highest Energies: Muon Colliders at 10 TeV to 100 TeV; Montauk, NY, September 27-October
1, 1999, web page http://pubweb.bnl.gov/people/bking/heshop. This work was performed under
the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract no. DE-AC02-98CH10886.

For comparison, table 1 also includes the parameter ranges for the lower energy
muon colliders that have been studied by the Muon Collider Collaboration (MCC).
This paper describes the methods used to generate the parameter sets, details the
motivations and assumptions for the speciﬁc choices of parameters and summarizes
the evaluations, conclusions and suggestions for the parameter sets that were given
by the workshop participants.

In more detail, the collider ring parameters are presented ﬁrst, in section II,
since they were considered the more critical of the two for assessing the feasibility
of many-TeV muon colliders. They also determine the initial assumptions used for
the acceleration parameters, which are then discussed in section III. The level of
understanding advanced substantially during the workshop, and section IV goes
over the issues and viewpoints raised during the workshop as well as referencing
the more detailed studies that are included elsewhere in these proceedings and dis-
cussing their impact on our assessment of the parameter sets. Finally, the Outlook
and Conclusions section, section V, summarizes the results discussed in the pre-
ceding section in the more general context of what they imply for the feasibility
of many-TeV muon colliders. This concluding section also discusses the outlook
for iterations and reﬁnements on the parameter sets and, more generally, previews
some plans for further studies on many-TeV muon colliders.

II STRAW-MAN MUON COLLIDER RING
PARAMETER SETS AT 10 TEV AND 100 TEV

A Generation of the Parameter Sets

The parameter sets in table 1 were generated through iterative runs of a stand-

alone computer program, as has been described previously (2; 3).

The most important physics parameter for a speciﬁed collider energy is the lu-
minosity, L. This is derived in terms of several input parameters according to the
formula (2):

L[cm−2.s−1] = 2.11 × 1033 × HB × (1 − e−2tD[γτµ])

×

fb[s−1](N0[1012])2(ECoM[TeV])3

C[km]

×  σθ[mr].δ[10−3]

ǫ6N[10−12] !2/3

where the input variables are the CoM energy (ECoM), the collider ring circumfer-
ence (C), the beams’ fractional momentum spread (δ) and 6-dimensional invariant
emittance (ǫ6N), the time until the beams are dumped (tD), the bunch repetition
frequency (fb), the initial number of muons per bunch (N0), and the beam diver-
gence at the interaction point (σθ). Units in equations throughout this paper are

given in square brackets. (The time-to-dump, tD, is given in units of the boosted
muon lifetime, γτµ.) This formula uses the standard assumption from the Muon
Collider Collaboration that the ratio of transverse to longitudinal emittances can
be manipulated freely in the muon cooling channel to maximize the luminosity for
a given ǫ6N. The pinch enhancement factor, HB, is very close to unity (see table 1),
and the numerical coeﬃcient in equation 1 includes a geometric correction factor
of 0.76 for the non-zero bunch length, σz = β ∗ (the “hourglass eﬀect”) .

In practice, the muon beam power and current are limiting parameters for en-
ergy frontier muon colliders, so the parameters are actually chosen to optimize the
“speciﬁc luminosity”:

l ≡

L

fb × N0

.

(2)

The luminosity is then determined from the choice of beam current that corresponds
to the highest plausible beam powers.

Several further parameters in table 1 have been derived from the input parameters
that determine the luminosity. These include, for example, the beam-beam tune
disruption parameter, ∆ν. Other output parameters require additional modeling
assumptions and/or further input parameters (2; 3). Examples include some of the
output parameters for the ﬁnal focus; these require both the input of a reference
pole-tip magnetic ﬁeld for the ﬁnal focus quadrupoles (B5σ) and a much simpliﬁed
model for the ﬁnal focus magnet lattice that is a linearized extrapolation from
existing ﬁnal focus lattice designs for lower energy muon colliders.

The physics parameters in table 1 include two examples of event sample sizes. As
is discussed in references (4; 5) these give an indication of the physics potential cor-
responding to the speciﬁed luminosity and energy. Brieﬂy, the number of µµ → ee
events gives a benchmark estimate of the discovery potential for elementary parti-
cles at the full CoM energy of the collider, while the production of hypothesized 100
GeV Higgs particles indicates roughly how the colliders might perform in studying
physics at a lower energy scale.

B Optimization of the 10 TeV and 100 TeV Parameter

Sets

The Initial Choice of Energies

The two energies for the parameter sets, ECoM = 10 TeV and 100 TeV, were
chosen because they bracket that energy decade. The 10 TeV lower limit was
chosen to be well above the highest energy that had been studied in detail, namely,
ECoM = 4 TeV for the Snowmass’96 workshop (6). Further, the neutrino radiation
for very high luminosity µ+µ− colliders at 10 TeV and above is high enough to
rule out siting them at an existing laboratory, as is covered elsewhere in these

4

proceedings (1). This necessitates a fresh outlook for the design optimization of
the µ+µ− colliders that is free from site-speciﬁc preconceptions involving existing
laboratories, which was considered a good thing.

The choice of the upper energy limit was more technically constrained. For
the 100 TeV parameter sets, the synchrotron radiation power had risen to become
almost identical to the beam power, signaling a clear upper bound for the feasibility
of circular µ+µ− colliders.

To preview later discussion, it is noted that our understanding of the constraints
on high energy muon colliders advanced during the workshop, as will be covered
in section IV. An additional constraint on the maximum possible energies for
circular muon colliders was discovered (7), due to beam heating arising from the
quantum mechanical nature of the synchrotron radiation. On the other hand, the
future prospects of many-TeV muon colliders were given a boost when the possible
potential for linear colliders at even higher energies was uncovered (8).

Balancing Luminosity against Technical Diﬃculty

After deciding on the collision energies, it was then decided that the 10 TeV
(set A) and the ﬁrst of the 100 TeV parameter sets (set B) should assume only
evolutionary changes in technology from the base-line parameters that have been
previously posited for lower energy colliders (9). For example, the assumed 6-
dimensional emittances are factors of 3.5 (10 TeV) or 50 (100 TeV) smaller than
the value 170 × 10−12 m3 that is normally used in Muon Collider Collaboration
scenarios for ﬁrst generation muon colliders. The smaller emittances assume that
the performance of the muon cooling channel will be progressively improved through
further design optimization, stronger magnets, higher gradient rf cavities and other
technological advancements and innovations.

The second parameter set at 100 TeV (i.e., set C) encouraged study on some of
the possibilities for using exotic technologies to improve the potential performance
of future many-TeV µ+µ− colliders. The additional assumed advances increased
the luminosity by two orders of magnitude over the evolutionary parameter set at
100 TeV, to what would be a very impressive 1 × 1038 cm−2.s−1. (The luminosity
2, as is explained in reference (5).) The hypothesized
should ideally rise as ECoM
technical advances included:

1. exotic cooling, to obtain a phase space density that is a further 3 orders of
magnitude larger than the assumption for the evolutionary parameter set at
100 TeV

2. charge compensation at the interaction point (ip), to reduce the eﬀective
charge by a factor of 10. This assumption led rather directly to a corre-
sponding increase in the luminosity by about a factor of 10.

3. more aggressive ﬁnal focus parameters were included to allow for potential

5

improvements in the ﬁnal focus design, perhaps using exotic focusing tech-
nologies

4. the beam power was almost doubled from the evolutionary parameter set (B),

to “top up” the luminosity to 1 × 1038 cm−2.s−1 .

Final Focus Constraints

The ﬁnal focus design may well present the most diﬃcult design challenges that
are relatively speciﬁc to high energy muon colliders. (This is to be contrasted with
the muon cooling channel, which is a formidable challenge for all muon colliders.)
References (2) and (3) have previously addressed the general design constraints and
issues for ﬁnal focus designs at many-TeV muon colliders.

To re-cap the discussion of references (2) and (3), higher energies demand pro-
gressively stronger focusing to generate the smaller spot sizes needed to increase
the luminosity. Two simply deﬁned parameters were used as benchmarks to obtain
ﬁnal focus speciﬁcations that might provide plausible starting assumptions for ﬁrst
attempts at magnet lattice designs. Firstly, an overall beam demagniﬁcation pa-
rameter is deﬁned (2) in terms of one of the Courant-Snyder lattice parameters, β,
as

M ≡ s βmax
β ∗ .

(3)

This is a dimensionless parameter that gauges the strength of the focusing. The size
of M should be closely correlated with fractional tolerances in magnet uniformity,
residual chromaticity, etc., where the chromaticity is a measure of the change in
response of the ﬁnal focus to oﬀ-momentum particles. Secondly, a high residual
chromaticity can be compensated for by decreasing the fractional momentum spread
of the beams, δ. This suggests that another measure of the ﬁnal focus diﬃculty
might come from the product of the demagniﬁcation and momentum spread,

q ≡ M δ,

(4)

where q has been referred to (2) as the “chromaticity quality factor”.

In generating the parameter sets, the values of M and q were compared to those
for existing e+e− and µ+µ− ﬁnal focus designs, as was discussed in references (2; 3).
In practice, slightly more attention was paid to q than to M in obtaining the ﬁnal
parameters. It can be seen from table 1 that the two “evolutionary” parameter
sets, A and B, were constrained to the value q = 10, which is very similar to the
calculated value, q = 11, for the ﬁnal focus lattice design of the 3 TeV µ+µ− collider
in reference (9). A more aggressive value, q = 45, was allowed for in the second
parameter set at 100 TeV.

It is noted that the parameter sets at these high energies are always limited by
∆ν and it is useful and straightforward to rewrite equations 1 and 2 in the form:

6

l ∝

∆ν
β ∗ ,

(5)

which has no explicit dependence on emittance or bunch size for a given energy. The
experience with optimizing the parameter sets was that this independence is true
as an approximation only (3); residual dependences on limiting magnet apertures
etc. meant that, in practice, it was almost always possible to slightly improve
the speciﬁc luminosity by re-optimizing to parameter sets with smaller assumed
emittances.

A value of ∆ν = 0.10 was assumed for all parameter sets. This was estimated
by interpolating the results from a beam tracking study described in reference (6).
Equation 5 and the discussion that follows indicate that the luminosity will scale
approximately linearly with diﬀerent assumed values for ∆ν.

Constraints on Energy Spread from Beamstrahlung

The “chromaticity quality factor” ﬁgure of merit, equation 4, favors decreasing
the fractional momentum spread, δ, in order to ease the diﬃculty of the ﬁnal focus,
and this strategy was found to be eﬀective in optimizing the luminosity for all three
parameter sets. By the ECoM = 100 TeV energy scale, however, the value of δ was
found (3) to be limited from below by the rapidly rising beamstrahlung at collision.
This occurred even though the fractional beamstrahlung energy loss, (∆E)brem,
remained at the level of parts-per-million per beam crossing, i.e., much less than
the percent level expected at TeV-scale linear e+e− colliders. The diﬀerence is the
need for multiple passes at µ+µ− colliders, which compounds the sensitivity to
beamstrahlung losses.

The average beamstrahlung energy losses can be replaced by rf acceleration, of
course. However, the particle-by-particle variations will contribute to the spread
in the beam momentum, and any such contributions from beamstrahlung must
be limited to somewhat below the original momentum spread of the beam. The
residual contributions to the beam energy spread should rise as the square root of
the number of passes, since they will be statistically independent from turn to turn.
Therefore, an appropriate criterion that was chosen to set lower limits on δ is:

(∆E)brem ×qnef f

turn

δ

<∼ 1,

(6)

where the eﬀective (i.e. luminosity-weighted) number of turns, nef f
turn, has values in
the range nef f
turn ≃ 1000. The evolutionary (B) and ultra-cool (C) parameter sets
at ECoM = 100 TeV had chosen values of 0.49 and 0.33 for the left hand side of
equation 6, respectively.

As an aside, it is noted that reference (3) had suggested following the lead of
proposed TeV-scale e+e− colliders by considering the option of using ﬂat, rather
than round, beam spots at the ip in order to reduce the beamstrahlung. This was

7

tried, but all attempts led to disappointing luminosities and so round beam spots
were retained for the parameter sets.

A Introduction

Table 2 gives straw-man acceleration scenarios that reproduce the ﬁnal energy
and bunch charge for each of the three straw-man muon collider ring scenarios
given in table 1, labeled as A) 10 TeV with 1036 luminosity, B) 100 TeV with 1036
luminosity and C) 100 TeV with 1038 luminosity. The layout of each of the two
recirculating complexes for table 2 is sketched schematically in ﬁgure 1.

The acceleration scenarios of table 2 and ﬁgure 1 will be described in subsec-
tion III D. For now, we note that the table contains only a minimal amount of
information – much less than was provided for the collider ring – and, in practice,
the acceleration parameters were much less critical than the collider ring parameters
for determining the technical feasibility or otherwise of the collider scenarios. This
viewpoint is supported by a much more detailed and knowledgeable acceleration
scenario that is presented elsewhere in these proceedings (10).

Aside from the technical considerations, the acceleration is expected to dominate
the cost of the colliders so its cost optimization will be very important and this

FIGURE 1. Accelerator layout for the acceleration scenario of table 2. The layout is schematic
and is certainly not drawn to scale. A single tunnel contains 5 rings of FFAG arcs. All the arcs
pass through the same rf cavities, shown here in 2 linacs on opposite sides of the tunnel. The
collider ring is also shown in the same tunnel, indicating that this accelerator complex brings
the beam up to collision energy, i.e., this could be the 0.5-5 TeV ring for the 10 TeV collider
(parameter set A) or the 5-50 TeV ring for the 100 TeV colliders (sets B and C). Transfer lines
between the rings are not shown. As an aside, 2 detectors are shown in the collider storage ring,
although this was not assumed in the workshop. This would double the luminosity but would
complicate the design of the storage ring.

was the main design criterion for the straw-man scenarios presented in table 2.
To minimize the cost, the scenarios use conﬁgurations of recirculating linacs with
“ﬁxed ﬁeld alternating gradient” (FFAG) magnet lattices.

The rest of this section is organized as follows. A very simplistic and non-
technical introduction to FFAGs will be given in the next subsection. Some pre-
liminaries on calculating decay losses during acceleration occupy the subsection
after that before, in subsection III D, returning to describe the motivation for the
parameter choices in table 2.

B FFAG Recirculating Arcs

The amount of expensive rf acceleration can be reduced many-fold relative to
linear accelerators by bending the muons around for many passes through the
same length of linac. The onus then shifts to minimizing the cost of the magnets
in the recirculating arcs. In turn, it is then desirable that each of the arcs be able
to accept a wide range of momenta so it can be reusable for many traverses. The
most promising option for doing this appears to lie in a class of either quadrupole-

magnet with a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The acute point of each triangle signiﬁes the direction
of the bending magnetic ﬁeld and the thickness at any radius signiﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld strength
in this direction rather than the spatial extent of the magnet.

in the ﬁeld gradient will not be linear.) If the magnet spacings and magnetic ﬁeld parameters
are appropriate then the non-uniform bending ﬁelds automatically provide alternating gradient
focusing in both transverse planes.

loaded or combined function magnet lattices that are referred to as “ﬁxed focus,
alternating gradient” or “FFAG” lattices. Fast-ramping synchrotrons may also be
considered (6; 9) but steady-state operation of FFAGs appears likely to be cheaper
and might well be more reliable.

Figure 2 gives a very conceptual illustration of the basic idea of FFAGs. It can
be seen that the alternating sign of the bending ﬁeld results in net bending in the
direction of the stronger dipoles a provides the scalloped beam trajectories that
are characteristic of FFAGs. Further out trajectories see a progressively stronger
average bending ﬁeld and so are appropriate for transporting larger momenta in
proportion to the average magnetic ﬁeld strength.

FFAGs were ﬁrst considered back in the 1950’s (11) but, presumably, were not
developed further at that time because the simpler alternative of slowly ramping
synchrotrons was adequate for the acceleration of stable particles.
Impressively,
FFAG lattices have now been designed that transport as much as factors of 5 to 10
in muon momentum, although such extreme designs require very large apertures
and the peak magnetic ﬁelds are several times the average bending ﬁeld. Some
initial design studies for more practical FFAG lattices are presented elsewhere in
these proceedings (12; 13).

Perhaps the biggest technical problem with all FFAG scenarios is the diﬃculty in
maintaining turn-by-turn an appropriate phase relationship with the rf acceleration,
since the path lengths of the muon orbits within the FFAG lattice get progressively
larger with increasing energy – as is conceptually illustrated in ﬁgure 2.
It is a

10

nice feature of many-TeV colliders that these problems become progressively less
at higher energies because the increasing revolution period through the arcs gives
more time for adjustments between passes through the linac.

C Rf Acceleration and Decay Losses

The amount of radio-frequency (rf) acceleration per turn will be determined by
a trade-oﬀ between minimizing the expense and the tunnel length occupied by rf
(favors less rf) and minimizing the number of turns and the decay losses (favors
more rf).

A formula relating the decay losses to the rf and recirculator parameters can be
derived directly from the decay equation for the change in the number of muons,

the approximation of averaging the acceleration to an assumed constant gradient
over the length of the recirculator rather than the real situation where it will be
concentrated in one or more rf linacs placed around the recirculator. This should
introduce only small fractional errors in the calculated particle losses for the pa-
rameters given in table 2.

D Optimization of the Straw-man Acceleration Scenario

The straw-man acceleration scenario presented in table 2 starts at 500 GeV,
working on the assumption that the acceleration to this energy range has already
been developed and used for a previous TeV-scale µ+µ− collider. The acceleration
scenario for the ECoM = 10 TeV collider (set A) then needs to provide exactly one

11

decade of energy gain, accelerating the beams from 0.5 TeV up to their collision
energy of 5 TeV. It economizes on expensive rf acceleration by utilizing only a
relatively modest 50 GV of rf cavities.

The ECoM = 100 TeV collider scenarios start with the ECoM = 10 TeV accelera-
tion scenario and add a further decade of acceleration to raise the beam energies
to 50 TeV. A further 250 GV of rf cavities are utilized, which is, for example, much
less rf than is required for the next generation of e+e− colliders and so should be
easily compatible with the budget constraints on a 100 TeV collider.

In more detail, it can be seen from table 2 that the recirculating accelerator to
50 TeV is essentially a scaled copy of that to 5 TeV. Both recirculators use 5 rings
of FFAG arcs and the fractional momentum increment in each of the 5 rings is
the same between the ﬁrst and second recirculator. As one diﬀerence, the average
bending ﬁelds, Bave, in the second recirculator are assumed to be a factor of 1.5
times higher than in the ﬁrst.

Figure 1 is a schematic diagram for a possible layout of either of the two recir-
culators. As a speciﬁc suggestion of this layout, it assumes the 5 FFAG rings to be
housed in the same tunnel. Further, this tunnel is assumed to be the collider tun-
nel, i.e., the 5+5 TeV collider for the ﬁrst recirculator and the 50+50 TeV collider
for the second.

The obvious motivation for the layout of ﬁgure 1 is to minimize the complexity
and tunnel expense of the scenario. However, requiring all 5 FFAG rings in a recir-
culator to have the same radius as the collider ring has the obvious consequences of
ﬁxing the FFAG ring radii and of constraining the average bending magnetic ﬁelds
in each ring according to the ranges of transported momenta in that ring. Table 2
gives a speciﬁc scenario for doing this.

The design of the later FFAG rings in each recirculator is clearly more constrained
than those for the earlier rings because the average bending ﬁeld must be closer
to the (assumed high) average bending ﬁeld of the collider ring. This is dealt with
in table 2 by constraining the momentum swing to become progressively smaller
for the later rings in the recirculators. Assumed energy ranges covered by the arcs
range from a factor of 2.5 increase – for the lowest energy arcs in each recirculator
– down to 10% energy gain for the highest energy arcs in each recirculator. These
are really no more than guesses since, for example, the magnet apertures and ratios
of peak-to-average magnetic ﬁelds required for this scenario are unknown.

Assumed average gradients for superconducting rf of 25 MV/m, as is assumed
for the proposed TESLA e+e− collider, correspond to total rf lengths of 2 km (10
km) for the 10 TeV (100 TeV) colliders, which is 13.3% (10.0%) of the collider ring
circumference. The example schematic layout of ﬁgure 1 shows the rf to be split
equally between the two straight sections of tunnel on the opposing sides of the
“race-track” collider ring, although this choice was somewhat arbitrary.

Decay losses were calculated according to equation 8. Non-decay losses were
neglected. Synchrotron radiation energy losses – which range up to about 10% per
turn at 50 TeV – have been included in a simple approximate manner. Table 2 shows
the overall decay losses to be acceptably low, at 10.5% and 13.9% respectively, for

12

each of the two decades of energy gain.

Having detailed the scenario, it should again be emphasized that the overall sce-
nario, together with its speciﬁc choices and assumptions, was intended to do no
more than provide the seed for more credible design studies from the accelerator
physicists attending this workshop. Nothing but the qualitative assumptions of the
scenario should be considered at all, and even these only at the reader’s discretion.
Of course, none of the speciﬁc numerical assumptions should be taken at all se-
riously, beyond perhaps obtaining a rough qualitative feel for such parameters as
the amount of rf acceleration required and the magnitudes for the fractional decay
losses.

Bearing the preceding paragraph in mind, we conclude this section by again
referring the reader to the vastly more competent and detailed acceleration studies
that emerged from the workshop: the overall acceleration scenarios of reference (10)
and the FFAG design studies in references (12) and (13).

This section reviews the studies and assessments at HEMC’99 of the collider ring
and acceleration parameter sets of tables 1 and 2. It will concentrate on the muon
collider design issues arising out of the parameter sets. The reader is also referred

13

to the summary paper by Willis (14) for a more general overview of the ﬁndings of
the workshop.

Table 3 summarizes the status of the acceleration and collider parameter sets
after review at the workshop. As an important piece of contextual information, the
assessment of parameter set A (10 TeV), assumes that a TeV-scale muon collider
has already been built and successfully operated and the parameter set in each
successive column assumes that the collider of the preceding column has already
been built.

The following subsections have been grouped according to subject areas that
follow fairly closely, but not exactly, the rows of table 3: on luminosity, acceleration,
detectors, cooling, synchrotron radiation, ﬁnal focus design and beam instabilities.
A more general outlook and list of conclusions based on these observations will be
deferred to the ﬁnal section, section V.

A Assessment of Luminosities for Physics

The luminosity requirements for µ+µ− colliders are discussed in some detail else-
2
where in these proceedings (5). Ideally, collider luminosities should rise as ECoM
and it is seen that, indeed, the luminosities for all three parameter sets in table 1
are higher than for any existing or (to the author’s knowledge) other proposed
collider.

Both parameter sets A and C have excellent luminosities, even considering their
high energies, while the luminosity of parameter set B was still considered to be
“fair” for a 100 TeV lepton collider. (See reference (5) for further discussion.)

B Assessment of the Acceleration Scenario

Studies at HEMC’99 focused more on the collider ring parameter sets of table 1
than on the acceleration scenario of table 2. The acceleration scenario was con-
sidered critical mostly to the extent that it would be expected to be the biggest
single component of the overall cost of the collider. Unfortunately, the cost of the
FFAG magnets was not able to be explicitly addressed in any detail due to the
newness and developing nature of FFAG scenarios (12; 13) for muon colliders. A
rather indirect source for some optimism on the acceleration costs could come from
any assumed correlation with some relatively favorable cost estimates for the col-
lider ring magnets, by Harrison (15), who roughly assessed the cost for the collider
magnets for the 10 TeV scenario (set A) to be perhaps of order 400 million dollars.
Technically, muon acceleration tends to get easier at higher energies due to the
increasing muon lifetime, smaller beam sizes and lower circulation frequencies in re-
circulating linacs. Hence, the technical feasibility of acceleration up to the energies
in the table is automatically established to a large extent by the assumed previous
success of the acceleration at a TeV-scale µ+µ− collider. As a minor caveat to
this, Harrison pointed out the increased load due to synchrotron radiation in the

14

FFAGs. However, the collider ring magnets will need to handle the synchrotron ra-
diation load for many times more turns than the FFAG arcs, so even this technical
diﬃculty is concentrated more in the collider ring than the accelerating lattice.

Berg (10) pointed out that slightly increased technical diﬃculties might instead
be expected for the low energy end of the acceleration for parameter sets A and,
especially, B. This could result from the higher speciﬁed values for the longitudinal
emittance in the many-TeV parameter sets: table 1 shows the longitudinal emit-
tances for these parameter sets to be, respectively, similar to, and about twice as
large as, the longitudinal emittance for the 3 TeV parameter set of reference (9).

C Detector Backgrounds

All muon collider detectors face challenging backgrounds resulting from the elec-
tron daughters of decaying muons near the interaction point. However, the amount
of electromagnetic “junk” entering the detector is relatively independent of the col-
lider energy since the power density of deposited electromagnetic energy depends
primarily on the beam current rather than the beam energy. (For conﬁrmation
of this statement, see the values in the “power density into magnet liner” row of
table 1.) Hence, such backgrounds are expected to be manageable for these many-
TeV parameter sets under the stated assumption that the problem has already
been solved at TeV-scale collider detectors. (A speciﬁc strategy for handling these
backgrounds that was developed at the workshop is described in reference (16) of
these proceedings.)

Muons entering the side of the detector, either from beam halo or Bethe-Heitler
µ+µ− pair production, are the one background that is expected to evolve markedly
with energy. As muons become more relativistic they become less and less like
minimum-ionizing particles and deposit larger amounts of energy “catastrophically”
in, mainly, electromagnetic showers. This issue was not addressed at the workshop
and it deserves further study.

D Beam Cooling

Parameter sets A and B assume only evolutionary improvements in the ionization
cooling performance over that assumed (but far from demonstrated (9)!) for TeV-
scale colliders so, by deﬁnition, the beam cooling should probably be OK if following
on from the TeV-scale collider. Parameter set C is very diﬀerent, assuming that
some form of exotic cooling will be able to increase the phase space density of the
muon beams by three orders of magnitude from that assumed for parameter set B.
Such ultra-cold muon beams are still looking plausible but have not yet pro-
gressed beyond that. The most promising of the exotic cooling methods is optical
stochastic cooling (17). This method clearly has formidable technical challenges
but no obvious show-stoppers. Other, very low energy, cooling methods were also
presented at the workshop (18; 19). There is some concern that any cooling method

15

using non-relativistic muons (i.e. with scaled velocity β ≪ 1) may well not be fea-
sible for preparing the high-charge muon bunches needed for colliders, due to space
charge limitations.

It is noted that parameter set C provides a speciﬁc example of a general feature
for ultra-cold muon beams. Since the collisions at many-TeV colliders would nor-
mally be tune-shift limited anyway, it is likely that improved cooling would also
require ip compensation to substantially beneﬁt the luminosity. We now discuss
yet another barrier to the use of ultra-cold beams, at least at very high energies,
from synchrotron radiation.

E Synchrotron Radiation

It has already been noted that the synchrotron radiation power in the 100 TeV
colliders is already comparable to the beam power. During the workshop, Telnov (7)
raised what might possibly be a stronger constraint from synchrotron radiation
on the energy reach of circular muon colliders, namely, the quantum nature of
synchrotron radiation may lead to heating, rather than damping, of the horizontal
beam emittance if the beam energy is high enough and the emittance is already
very small.

Telnov’s observation clearly spells the end of parameter set C, with its ultra-cold
beam at ECoM = 100 TeV. The other parameter set at 100 TeV (set B) is also
borderline, with an initial horizontal emittance that is larger by a factor of ﬁve (7)
than the equilibrium emittance due to this eﬀect, as calculated by Telnov using a
simple approximate model.

The most likely possible loop-hole for parameter set B is that the heating eﬀect
is reduced for a very strongly focusing collider lattice. More speciﬁcally, Telnov’s
equation 2 shows the equilibrium emittance to be proportional to the average of
the “H-function” around the collider ring, where

H ∝

β3
ρ2

,

(9)

for β the standard Courant-Snyder parameter and ρ the collider ring’s radius.
(Stronger focusing corresponds to smaller β values around the ring.)

To consider adjustments to parameter set B, equation 9 suggests that 100 TeV
colliders with the emittances expected from ionization cooling still look to be fea-
sible by increasing the ring radius, ρ, by, for example, a factor of two. This would
lower both the equilibrium emittance by a factor of four and the radiated energy per
turn by a factor of two, which is substantial compensation for halving the number
of collisions per bunch.

A much more dramatic approach to beating the energy limits from synchrotron
radiation has come from Zimmermann (8), in the form of single pass linear µ+µ−
colliders. Example parameter sets are included in Zimmermann’s paper, and are
commented on in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings (5).

F Final Focus Design

The ﬁnal focus design extrapolations discussed in section II seemed to work well
for the 10 TeV parameter set A. A magnet layout for the ﬁnal focus from John-
stone (20) closely reproduced the predicted βmax in table 1. Further, the lattice
design experts at the workshop seemed to appreciate the extremely challenging
nature of the 10 TeV ﬁnal focus parameters without everybody actually condemn-
ing them as being clearly unrealistic, i.e., an appropriate level of diﬃculty for a
workshop of this nature! See reference (8) for more detailed studies and comments.
The 100 TeV parameter sets were less fortunate. Even the “evolutionary” param-
eter set B was immediately dismissed by the lattice experts as being incompatible
with any ﬁnal focus lattice designs using conventional magnets.
It will be very
useful to get further feedback on what exactly broke down in the simplistic energy
extrapolation that was described in section II A. Hopefully, such feedback can then
be used to obtain a better parameterization of the energy evolution in the ﬁnal
focus parameters. A more realistic and better established parameterization could
then be used to predict the luminosity scaling with energy that might be expected
using conventional ﬁnal focus technologies.

Finally, two exotic ﬁnal focus options were discussed that might go beyond con-
ventional magnet designs: “dynamic focusing” (using auxiliary beams to focus the
colliding beams) and plasma focusing. Discouragingly, both options looked much
less plausible than when considered for single pass e+e− colliders, due to both the
need for multiple passes and the larger bunch currents assumed for µ+µ− collider
parameters. Also disappointing are the obstacles to beam compensation at colli-
sion (as was assumed in parameter set C), which call into question the possibility
of being able to do this – see reference (21) for discussion on this topic.

G Beam Instabilities in the Collider Ring

Papers by Keil (22) and Zimmermann (8) provide studies on beam instabilities.
Keil provides a systematic assessment of the classes of instabilities, including pa-
rameter comparisons with the LHC collider ring. Zimmermann’s tracking studies
demonstrated that even circulating the beams for a single turn should not be taken
for granted, let alone for of order 1000 turns over the lifetime of the muons.

As a connection to the physics capabilities of the collider ring that needs to be
borne in mind, the common assumption (9) of collider rings that are isochronous is
disfavored for retaining the beam polarization. (See also reference (23) for a discus-
sion on the importance of polarization.) As a rough hand-waving explanation, the
rate of polarization precession while circulating in the collider ring is proportional
to the muon’s energy. It is intuitively clear that the polarization will decay away
more slowly if the energies of all the particles are allowed to slosh around the beam
average energy – sometimes gaining in polarization precession (higher energy) over
the bunch average precession and sometimes losing (lower energy than the bunch

17

average). This is what happens in a collider ring with longitudinal focusing as
opposed to isochronous rings. The same argument also favors small beam energy
spreads.

V OUTLOOK AND CONCLUSIONS

The preceding section has reviewed the insights from HEMC’99 on the parameter
sets of tables 1 and 2. More generally than this, HEMC’99 has provided the ﬁrst
speculative insights into (i) the ultimate physics potential for future colliders at the
high energy frontier and (ii) the potential challenges to reaching very high energies
with muon colliders. A personal interpretation of the workshop’s ﬁndings through
the energy decades is:

• muon colliders to the TeV scale: (added for completeness – these energies
were not discussed in detail at the workshop) beam cooling is the dominant
technical challenge. Other major challenges are the ﬁnal focus region, back-
grounds in the detector, cost-eﬃcient acceleration and beam stability through-
out the cooling, acceleration and storage in the collider ring. Neutrino radia-
tion will impose signiﬁcant design constraints and the beam currents may be
well below those for the straw-man parameters in reference (9) (i.e. 6 × 1020
muons/sign/year in collision).

• to advance to the 10 TeV scale: neutrino radiation will probably dictate
a new site. The ﬁnal focus region of the collider and magnet cost reduction
for acceleration may be the other major technical design issues.

• to advance to the 100 TeV scale: major breakthroughs are needed in

magnet costs and in the ﬁnal focus region.

• to advance to the 1 PeV scale and beyond: this is not absolutely ruled
out in the far distant future using a linac and many technological break-
throughs, as illustrated by the parameter set in reference (8) and discussed
further in reference (5).

It would certainly be very valuable to follow up on the understandings gained
at this workshop. As a small ﬁrst step, modiﬁed parameter sets for many-TeV
muon colliders are being generated (24) that take into account the insights gained
at HEMC’99. As a reﬁnement to make interpolations easier, a parameter set at the
intermediate center-of-mass energy of 30 TeV will be included.

More substantially, there is need for a new study and workshop. Preferably,
this should include all three of the main accelerator technologies – pp, e+e− and
µ+µ− colliders. This is motivated (5) both for a more coherent understanding of
the future of experimental high energy physics and in recognition that the three
accelerator technologies are deeply intertwined. Planning is underway for such a
study to take place in the Summer and Fall of 2001.

Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) can play an important role by not only increasing the
energy spread and emittance of a beam, but also leading to a potential instability. Previous studies
of the CSR induced longitudinal instability were carried out for the CSR impedance due to dipole
magnets. However, many storage rings include long wigglers where a large fraction of the synchrotron
radiation is emitted. This includes high-luminosity factories such as DAPHNE, PEP-II, KEK-B,
and CESR-C as well as the damping rings of future linear colliders. In this paper, the instability
due to the CSR impedance from a wiggler is studied assuming a large wiggler parameter K. The
primary consideration is a low frequency microwave-like instability, which arises near the pipe cut-oﬀ
frequency. Detailed results are presented on the growth rate and threshold for the damping rings of
several linear collider designs. Finally, the optimization of the relative fraction of damping due to
the wiggler systems is discussed for the damping rings.

INTRODUCTION

When an electron bunch passes the curved trajectory
inside a dipole, the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR)
induces an impedance [1, 2, 3, 4]. The CSR impedance
is known to impact single pass bunch compressors where
the beam currents are extremely high [5, 6, 7, 8] but
it is also possible that CSR might cause a microwave-
like beam instability in storage rings. A theory of such
an instability in a storage ring has been recently pro-
[9] where the impedance is generated by
posed in Ref.
the synchrotron radiation of the beam in the storage ring
bending magnets.

A similar instability may arise due to coherent syn-
chrotron radiation in long wigglers. Many storage rings
have used large wiggler systems to reduce the damping
times and control the beam emittance. In particular, the
high luminosity colliding beam factories DAPHNE [10],
PEP-II [11], KEK-B [12], CESR-C [13] all have wiggler
systems that can radiate signiﬁcantly more power than is
radiated in the arc bending magnets. Similarly, damping
ring designs for future linear colliders rely on large wig-
gler systems to obtain the required damping rates where,
again, more power can be radiated in the wiggler systems
than in the arc bending magnets.

In a previous study, the wakeﬁeld and impedance in a
wiggler with large parameter K has been obtained [14]
based on the work of Saldin et al.
[15]. In this paper,

we study the impact of the wiggler synchrotron radiation
impedance on the beam longitudinal dynamics in rings
with dipoles and wigglers. We focus our attention on the
limit of a large wiggler parameter K because this is the
most interesting case for many applications.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we will
brieﬂy review the theory of the beam instability in a ring
due to the CSR impedance [9]. Using the synchrotron ra-
diation impedance of a wiggler [14], we study the beam
instability problem for a ring including both dipoles and
wigglers in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we then focus on a low-
frequency microwave-like CSR instability near the pipe
cut-oﬀ frequency which is the primary limitation. Fi-
nally, in Sec. V, we discuss eﬀect of the CSR instability
on the design optimization of damping rings for future
linear colliders. Finally, we give some discussions and
conclusion in Sec. VI.

II. LONGITUDINAL BEAM INSTABILITY

We consider the longitudinal dynamics of a thin coast-
ing beam. The beam can be described with a longitudinal
distribution function ρ(ν, s, z). The positive direction for
the internal coordinate s is pointing to the direction of
the motion. The relative energy oﬀset of a particle hav-
ing energy E with respect to the nominal energy E0 is
E0)/E0. The position of the ref-
expressed as ν = (E
erence particle in the beam line is z = c t with c equal to
the speed of light in vacuum.

The longitudinal beam instability due to the syn-
chrotron radiation impedance in a ring has been studied
theoretically by Stupakov and Heifets [9]. In this section,
we brieﬂy review and reproduce the equations we need
for our study in this paper. The reader is advised to refer
to reference [9] for the details of the theory.

For a matched beam, one can use a 1-D Vlasov equa-
tion to describe the evolution of the longitudinal distri-
bution function ρ(ν, s, z).

with α equal to the momentum compaction factor. For
ultrarelativistic beams, we have η
α. Based on our def-
inition of s, the sign convention for α is then the follow-
ing. If a particle with a higher energy than the nominal
energy, i.e., ν > 0, would go to the head of the bunch,
then the beam line provides a negative α. According to
this convention, then in a simple bending magnet, we will
have α > 0, while in a wiggler, we have α < 0.

The distribution function ρ is written as a sum of
the equilibrium distribution function and a perturbation,
ρ = ρ0(ν) + ρ1(ν, s, z), with ρ1
ρ0. We look for a per-
turbation as

≪

ρ1 = ˆρ1 e− i ω z/c + i k s ,

where k is the wavenumber, ω the frequency. Linearizing

respond to the energy loss and the negative values imply
the energy gain.

We assume that the initial energy distribution function

where n0 is the linear density, i.e., the number of particles

III. STORAGE RINGS WITH WIGGLERS

As mentioned, a number of storage rings utilize long
damping wigglers where a signiﬁcant fraction of the en-
ergy loss per turn is emitted. As concrete examples,
we study the NLC main damping ring [16], the TESLA
damping ring [17], and the KEK ATF prototype damping
ring [18]. Parameters are given in Table I.

In our paper, we use the steady state CSR impedance
and assume a distributed impedance model. For a dipole,
the steady state CSR impedance is [1, 2]

TABLE I: Parameters and results for the NLC main damping ring [16], the TESLA damping ring [17], and the KEK ATF
prototype damping ring [18]. The parameter Fw is the ratio of the radiation power emitted in the wiggler to that emitted in
the arc bending magnets deﬁned in Eq. (16).

In Fig. 1, the imaginary part of Ω is plotted as a
function of the instability wavenumber for the NLC main
damping ring using the parameters listed in Table I. At
low frequencies, the dipole CSR impedance dominates
while at shorter wavelengths the wiggler CSR impedance
is usually more important. In the region where Im(Ω)<
0, the beam is stable and this is true for all regions except
at the longest wavelengths as shown in the inset. This
low frequency instability will be discussed in the following
section.

Similar calculations were made for the TESLA “dog-
bone” damping ring, where the total bending angle is
about Θ = 10π/3, and the KEK ATF prototype damping
ring. For the design current in the TESLA damping ring,
the impedance from the dipoles and wigglers will not
drive an instability while the results for the ATF are very
similar to those of the NLC damping ring shown in Fig.
1.

One interesting eﬀect can be seen at the wiggler radia-
tion fundamental frequency and the odd harmonics where
the ring is actually stabilized by the wiggler impedance.
This is opposite to the single-pass behaviour through a
wiggler where there is an instability at the wiggler fun-
damental frequency usually refered to as the FEL insta-
bility. The eﬀect will be discussed further in Appendix A

but is a direct result of the positive sign of the momentum
compaction in the ring.

To illustrate this, Fig. 2 is a plot for the NLC damp-
ing ring with identical wiggler and arc parameters but the
momentum compaction is assumed to be opposite in sign.
Here, one can see that at low frequencies the growth is
slightly lower. In contrast, the wiggler impedance makes
the system less stable at the wiggler fundamental unlike
the case with positive momentum compaction. Further-
more, if the magnitude of the momentum compaction is
reduced, the system will become unstable similar to that
illustrated in Appendix B. This is similar to the FEL in-
stability however, it is also noted in Appendix A that our
theory does not correctly treat the full FEL instability.

IV. LOW-FREQUENCY CSR INSTABILITY

As seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the instability is most impor-
tant at relatively low frequency. The longest instability
wavelength that is possible is determined by two eﬀects:
ﬁrst, the instability wavelength has to be short compared
to the bunch length and, second, the vacuum chamber
causes an exponential suppression of the synchrotron ra-
diation at wavelengths λ greater than the ‘shielding cut-

entire CSR impedance while the dotted and dashed curves
include either the steady state dipole CSR impedance or the
wiggler CSR impedance, respectively. The inset shows a blow

Here, R is the dipole bending radius, and b is the vac-
uum chamber half height. The numerical coeﬃcient of
Eq. (10) assumes that the vacuum chamber is made up
of two inﬁnitely wide plates. Diﬀerent cross sections give
diﬀerent numerical factors [23]. Given the previous dis-
cussion, the threshold will be the lowest at the smaller of
the bunch length or the ‘shielding cutoﬀ’ wavelength.

For the NLC main damping ring, we ﬁnd that pertur-
bations with wavelengths λ > 3.5 mm are not stable due
to the dipole CSR impedance alone. Adding the CSR
impedance from the wiggler causes perturbations with
wavelengths λ > 2.6 mm to be unstable. In Fig. 3, the
threshold particle number is plotted as a function of the
perturbation wavelength. Next, in Fig. 4, the growth
rate, which is deﬁned as the inverse of the time needed
for the perturbation to grow by a factor of e

is plotted versus the perturbation wavelength. Based on
the parameters in Table I and Eq. (10), the ‘shielding

cutoﬀ’ wavelength is computed to be λc ≈
this cutoﬀ wavelength, the threshold currents and growth
time are summarized in Table I. The growth time is sig-
niﬁcantly faster than the synchrotron period, in agree-
ment with the analysis for a microwave-like instability.

FIG. 3: The threshold particle number as a function of the
CSR wavelength for the NLC main damping ring. The dashed
curve is the result for the dipoles only, while the solid curve
takes into account of the contributions from the dipoles and
the wigglers. The vertical straight line is the approximate cut-
oﬀ wavelength according to Eq. (10). The horizontal straight
line is the nominal number of particles per bunch: 0.75×1010 .

It is clearly seen that the threshold current decreases as
we approach the longer wavelength perturbations, how-
ever, the growth rate is not monotonic. This is the result
of two opposite mechanisms: one is the energy modula-
tion growth due to the CSR impedance, and the other is
the Landau damping. For very long wavelength pertur-
bation, Landau damping eﬀect is small, hence, we could
expand the denominator of the integrand in Eq. (4) to
get

perturbation to the short wavelength perturbation, the

However, this process stops when Landau damping be-
comes eﬀective. The ﬁnite energy spread in the beam will
produce a phase mixing due to the slippage and this will
destroy density modulation due to the CSR induced en-
ergy modulation. The Landau damping due to the phase
mixing is more serious for short wavelength perturba-
tions. This damping can be seen in the second term of
Eq. (1), or more clearly, in the denominator of the dis-
persion relation in Eq. (4). This is demonstrated in Fig.
4, the growth rate ﬁnally decreases when we approach
very short wavelength, and eventually, the system be-
comes stable.

For the KEK ATF prototype damping ring, the cut-oﬀ

(10). In Fig. 5, the threshold particle number is plotted
as a function of the perturbation wavelength. Taking the
dipole CSR impedance alone, for the single bunch charge,
the instability sets in for perturbations with wavelengths
λ > 2.8 mm. Adding the wiggler CSR impedance, the
electron beam would be unstable for perturbations with
wavelengths λ > 1.9 mm. Other results are summarized
in Table I.

It is interesting to note that in both the NLC and the
ATF damping rings roughly twice as much synchrotron
radiation power is emitted in the wiggler as in the arc
dipoles. However, the instability threshold is not dramat-
ically impacted by the additional radiation in the wiggler
and decreases by less than a factor of two in each case.
This arises because of the very diﬀerent low frequency
behavior of the impedances.

We can use a simple scaling analysis to understand
this. According to Eq. (7), the dipole CSR impedance
k1/3. Similarly, the low frequency
scales as ZD(k)
behavior of the wiggler impedance is [14]

Hence, it suggests an optimization of the damping ring
design where a larger fraction of radiation is emitted in
the wigglers as will be discussed subsequently.

V. DAMPING RING OPTIMIZATION

Damping rings are used in linear colliders to attain
the very small transverse emittances that required to at-
tain the desired small spot sizes at the collision point.
In the damping rings, the emission of synchrotron radia-
tion damps the phase space volume of the injected beams
towards the equilibrium values. An e-folding reduction
of the transverse phase space occurs after the emission
of synchrotron radiation energy comparable to the beam
energy.

There are usually three conﬂicting requirements on the
damping rings: ﬁrst, the equilibrium emittances must
be small which usually requires weak bends and strong
focusing; second, the dynamic aperture must be large to
accept the injected beams and this is diﬃcult to attain in
a strong focusing storage ring; and, third, the damping
rates must be fast so that the incoming phase space and
transients can be damped before the beam are extracted

6

Examples of the scaling of these parameters versus Fw
can be found in Figs. 11 and 13 of Ref. [25] for an earlier
version of the NLC damping ring. Using these relations,
we estimated parameters for NLC ring with Fw = 0 and
Fw = 6.5. These parameters are summarized in Table II
along with the nominal parameters where Fw = 2.2.

and accelerated to the collision point.

To achieve these conﬂicting requirements most damp-
ing ring designs have been forced to include long damping
wigglers where a signiﬁcant fraction of the energy loss per
turn is emitted. Of course, the ring characteristics can
be greatly modiﬁed by changing the ratio of the damp-
ing due to the wiggler versus that due to the bending
magnets. However, historically the wiggler systems have
been a concern because they are a signiﬁcant source of
non-linearity and because they generate intense radiation
which may directly or indirectly impact the beam.

Other work has improved the conﬁdence in the dy-
namic aperture predictions and has shown that properly
designed wigglers should not impose a limitation [24].
Thus, we can further optimize the ring designs based on
quantitative evaluations of the eﬀect of the wiggler radi-
ation ﬁelds.

To study the ring optimization, we use expressions de-
rived in Ref. [25] for the damping ring parameters. The
primary constraint is the damping times. Because all
linear collider designs presently only consider ﬂat beams
σy, the tightest requirement is on the vertical
with σx ≫
damping time which, using Eq. (11) of Ref. [25], can be
written

where Ba is the arc bending ﬁeld, C is the ring circum-
ference, and Θ is the total bending angle of the arcs.
In addition, Fw is a parameter equal to the ratio of the
damping due to the wiggler over the damping due to the
arc bending magnets which can be written:
Fw ≡

for a given ring size and damping time and, given a max-
imum wiggler ﬁeld, the required wiggler length can be

the other ring parameters. According to the dispersion
relation in Eq. (6), we will need the momentum com-
paction factor α, the energy spread ν0, and the bunch
rms length σz. Using Eqs. (37), (39) and (40) from Ref.

indicating the corresponding cutoﬀ wavelength. Their cross
point gives the threshold at the cutoﬀ wavelength. The solid
curve and vertical solid straight line are for the case of Fw =

dotted straight line are for the case of Fw = 6.5. The dot-
dashed curve is for the case of Fw = 6.5, but the impedance
is the dipole CSR impedance alone.

At this point, we can calculate the impedance. Based
on our previous studies, we expect the CSR impedance
from the wiggler to be small compared to the CSR
impedance of dipoles in the low frequency region of in-
terest. Hence, the threshold is essentially determined by
the dipole CSR impedance. According to the impedance
in Eqs. (9) and (7), and the relation of Ba and Fw in Eq.
(15), the total impedance should scale as

decreases, the cutoﬀ wavelength will decrease. Since, the
threshold is lowest at long wavelength, the threshold will
increase as Fw is increased due to the shift in the cutoﬀ
wavelength as well as the change in the ring parameters.
The above scaling analysis has been compared to nu-
merical calculations for the NLC damping ring. The
results are given in Fig. 6 where we plot the thresh-
old particle number as a function of the CSR instabil-
ity wavelength for Fw = 0 (dashes), 2.2 (solid) and 6.5
(dots). In addition, the cutoﬀ wavelength for the three
cases is indicated with vertical lines using the same no-
tation. Clearly, the threshold increases rapidly as Fw
is increased as expected. The approximately quadratic
scaling given above is followed as Fw is increased from
the nominal value of 2.2 to 6.5 but the dependence is
weaker as Fw is decreased to 0 because of the change
in the beam energy spread which was assumed constant.
Based on these results a new version of the NLC damping
6.5 which has a sig-
ring has been designed with an Fw ≈
niﬁcantly higher threshold for both this CSR instability
as well as the conventional microwave instability driven
by the vacuum chamber impedance [26].

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we studied a possible beam instability
due to coherent synchrotron radiation from dipole and
wiggler magnets in a storage ring. This instability may
be important in many high luminosity factories such as
DAPHNE, PEP-II, KEK-B, and CESR-C as well as the
damping rings of future linear colliders. We used the
results to analyze the stability of the damping ring de-
signs and found that a possible instability due to the
CSR will exist in the NLC damping ring design and the
ATF prototype damping ring at KEK. We then discuss
optimization of the rings and the pros and cons of in-
creasing the damping fraction due to the wigglers. This
led to a redesign for the NLC damping which increases

the threshold to more than four times the nominal charge
per bunch.

As we discussed above, in our calculation, we used
steady state impedance for both the dipoles and wigglers.
In the future, it may be important to consider transient
eﬀects in our calculation. In addition, the shielding cutoﬀ
of the CSR should be calculated as part of the impedance
and not treated as an ad hoc limit. This is also important
because we assumed the same shielding cutoﬀ around the
ring but in practice it will diﬀer in the bending magnets
and the wigglers. Finally, the bunch length is the same
order of the instability wavelength, while in the theory,
we use a coasting beam model. In the future, the ﬁnite
bunch length should be taken into consideration. All of
these topics are under study and will be reported in a
separate paper.

APPENDIX A: GROWTH RATE AT THE FEL
FREQUENCY AND THE ODD HARMONICS

In this appendix, we discuss the growth rates calcu-
lated at the wiggler fundamental frequency, frequently
refered to as the FEL frequency, and at the odd harmon-
ics. The wiggler CSR long-range wakeﬁeld is [14]

The upper (lower) sign in Eq. (A4) refers to the case of
a positive (negative) η. For the rings which we study in
this paper, they all have η > 0 and we take the upper
sign. Hence, Im(Ω) = 0, i.e., the growth rate will be zero
and the system is stable at the FEL frequency and all
the odd harmonics. This agrees with the conventional
knowledge that a ring is stable with a purely inductive
impedance and a positive momentum compaction or a
purely capacitive impedance and a negative momentum
compaction.

APPENDIX B: SINGLE WIGGLER

In this appendix, we study the beam instability in a
single wiggler. From FEL theory, we would expect in-

and all the harmonics. In addition, we need to look at a
microwave-like low-frequency instability.

rings [16, 17]. For the region where Im(Ω)< 0, the beam
is stable. We ﬁnd that, for the nominal current, the
system is stable within the entire interesting region where
the perturbation wavelength λ < 3 cm, except at the
wiggler fundamental radiation wavelength and the third
harmonic.

In fact, according to Eq.

(B1), we have η < 0 and
we need take the lower sign in Eq.
(A4). When we
approach the fundamental and the third harmonic fre-
quency, L becomes large, and Eq. (A4) gives us a large
Im(Ω), i.e., a large growth rate as we ﬁnd in Fig. 7. How-

ever, according to Eq. (A4), we will have Im(Ω)
where I is the peak current of the electron bunch; while

in the FEL theory, the growth rate scales as Im(Ω)
[19]. To correctly calculate the FEL instability from the
wake impedance approach, the electron density distribu-
tion function has to be taken at the retarded time in
the standard Vlasov equation [20]. This then leads to
a cubic dispersion relation same as in the FEL theory,
and results in the cubic root scaling in the growth rate:

Nevertheless, here we further use the FEL theory to
study the instability at the FEL frequency and the third
harmonic. We use the simulation code TDA [21] to cal-
culate the instability growth length at the fundamental
frequency and a newly developed code [22] to calculate
the instability at the third harmonic. The wiggler and
beam parameters used are listed in Table I. In the NLC
damping wiggler, the growth length at the FEL frequency
is about 50 m assuming that the phase errors between
wiggler sections is small. Fortunately, the separation be-
tween the 2-meter long wiggler sections will further re-
duce the gain. In addition, any modulation that is in-
duced at the fundamental wavelength of
10 µm will be
smeared out by the energy spread and the momentum
compaction as the beam is transported around the re-
mainder of the ring. A similar conclusion is found for
the TESLA damping ring wigglers and the instability at
the FEL frequency and the odd harmonics are not ex-
pected to be a limitation in either case.

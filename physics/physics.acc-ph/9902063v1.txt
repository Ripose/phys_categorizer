Abstract. In this paper we consider applications of methods from wavelet analysis
to nonlinear dynamical problems related to accelerator physics. In our approach we
take into account underlying algebraical, geometrical and topological structures of
corresponding problems.

I

INTRODUCTION

This paper is the sequel to our ﬁrst paper in this volume [1], in which we con-
sidered the applications of a number of analytical methods from nonlinear (local)
Fourier analysis, or wavelet analysis, to nonlinear accelerator physics problems.
This paper is the continuation of results from [2]–[7], which is based on our ap-
proach to investigation of nonlinear problems, both general and with additional
structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, and
quantum. Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods, which
gives us the possibility of working with well-localized bases in functional spaces and
with the general type of operators (diﬀerential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential) in such
bases. In contrast with paper [1], in this paper we try to take into account before
using power analytical approaches underlying algebraical, geometrical, and topo-
logical structures related to the kinematical, dynamical and hidden symmetry of
physical problems. In this paper we give a review of a number of the corresponding
problems and describe the key points of some possible methods by which we can
ﬁnd the full solutions of the initial physical problem. We describe a few concrete
problems in [1, part II]. The most interesting case is the dynamics of spin-orbital
motion [1, II D]. Related problems may be found in [8].

∗∗) This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Departmentof Energy under Contract
No. DE-AC02-98CH10886.

The content of this paper is nothing more than an attempt to extract the most
complicated formal, mathematical or principal parts of the world of nonlinear ac-
celerator physics, which is today beyond the mainstream, in our opinion.

In part II we consider dynamical consequences of covariance properties regarding
relativity (kinematical) groups and continuous wavelet transform as a method for
the solution of dynamical problems. In part II A we introduce the semidirect prod-
uct structure, which allows us to consider, from a general point of view all relativity
groups such as Euclidean, Galilei, and Poincare. Then in part II B we consider the
Lie-Poisson equations and obtain the manifestation of semiproduct structure of the
(kinematic) symmetry group on a dynamical level. So, correct description of dy-
namics is a consequence of correct understanding of real symmetry of the concrete
problem. In part II C we consider the technique for simpliﬁcation of dynamics re-
lated to semiproduct structure by using reduction to corresponding orbit structure.
As result we have simpliﬁed Lie-Poisson equations. In part II D we consider the La-
grangian theory related to semiproduct structure and an explicit form of variation
principle and corresponding (semidirect) Euler-Poicare equations. In part II E we
introduce a continuous wavelet transform and corresponding analytical technique,
which allow covariant wavelet analysis. In part II F we consider, in the particular
case, the aﬃne Galilei group with the semiproduct structure, also the correspond-
ing orbit technique for constructing diﬀerent types of invariant wavelet bases. In
In
part III we consider, instead of kinematical symmetry, dynamical symmetry.
part III A, according to the orbit method and by using construction from the ge-
ometric quantization theory, we construct the symplectic and Poisson structures
associated with generalized wavelets by using metaplectic structure. We consider
the wavelet approach to the calculations of the Melnikov functions in the theory of
homoclinic chaos in the perturbed Hamiltonian systems in part III B and for calcu-
lation of Arnold–Weinstein curves (closed loops) in the Floer variational approach
in part III C. In parts III D and III E we consider applications of a very useful
fast wavelet transform technique (part III F) to calculations in a symplectic scale
of spaces and to quasiclassical evolution dynamics. This method gives maximally
sparse representation of a (diﬀerential) operator that allows us to take into account
a contribution from each level of resolution. In part IV A we consider symplectic
and Lagrangian structures for the case of discretization of ﬂows by corresponding
maps; and in part IV B construction of corresponding solutions by applications of
a generalized wavelet approach which is based on generalization of multiresolution
analysis for the case of maps.

II SEMIDIRECT PRODUCT, DYNAMICS, WAVELET

REPRESENTATION

A Semidirect Product

Relativity groups such as Euclidean, Galilean, or Poincare groups are particular
cases of semidirect product construction, which is very useful and of simple general
construction in the group theory [9]. We may consider as a basic example in the
Euclidean group SE(3) = SO(3) ⊲⊳ R3, the semidirect product of rotations and
translations. In the general case we have S = G ⊲⊳ V , where group G (Lie group
or automorphisms group) acts on a vector space V and on its dual V ∗. Let V be
a vector space and G is the Lie group, which acts on the left by linear maps on V
(G also acts on the left on its dual space V ∗). The semidirect product S = G ⊲⊳ V
is the Cartesian product S = G

V with group multiplication

×

(g1, v1)(g2, v2) = (g1g2, v1 + g1v2),

(1)

∈

G on v

where the action of g
V is denoted as gv. Of course, we can consider
the corresponding deﬁnitions both in the case of the right actions and in the case
when G is a group of automorphisms of the vector space V. As we shall explain
below, both cases — Lie groups and automorphisms groups — are important for
us.

So, the Lie algebra of S is the semidirect product of Lie algebra, s =

⊲⊳ V with

ξ2v1),

C Reduction of Dynamics on Semiproduct

There is the technique for reducing dynamics that is associated with the geometry
of the semidirect product reduction theorem[9]. Let us have a Hamiltonian on T ∗G
V ∗. The semidirect product
that is invariant under the isotropy Ga0 for a0 ∈
reduction theorem states that reduction of T ∗G by Ga0 gives reduced spaces that
are simplectically diﬀeomorphic to coadjoint orbits in the dual of the Lie algebra
⊲⊳ V )∗. If one reduces the semidirect group product
of the semidirect product (
S = G ⊲⊳ V in two stages, ﬁrst by V and then by G one recovers this semidirect
V ∗
product reduction theorem. Thus, let S = G ⊲⊳ V , choose σ = (µ, a)
∈ G
×
and reduce T ∗S by the action of S at σ, giving the co-adjoint orbit
Oσ through
σ
Oσ and the reduced space
obtained by reducing T ∗G by the subgroup Ga (the isotropy of G for its action on
V ∗ at the point a

S∗. There is a symplectic diﬀeomorphism between

Then we have the following procedure.

1. We start with a Hamiltonian Ha0 on T ∗G that depends parametrically on a

variable a0 ∈

V ∗.

2. The Hamiltonian regarded as a map: T ∗G

4. By the semidirect product reduction theorem, the dynamics of Ha0 reduced
by Ga0, the isotropy group of a0, is simplectically equivalent to Lie-Poisson
dynamic on s∗ =

5. This Lie-Poisson dynamics is given by equations (12) for the function h(µ, a) =

H(αg, g−

1a), where µ = g−

1αg.

D Lagrangian Theory, the Euler-Poincare Equations,

Variational Approach on Semiproduct

Now we make a consideration based on [9], the Lagrangian side of a theory. This
approach is based on variational principles with symmetry and is not dependent
on a Hamiltonian formulation, although it is demonstrated in [9] that this purely
Lagrangian formulation is equivalent to the Hamiltonian formulation on duals of
the semidirect product (the corresponding Legendre transformation is a diﬀeomor-
phism).

We consider the case of the left representation and the left invariant Lagrangians
(ℓ and L), which depend in addition on another parameter a
V ∗ (dynamical
parameter), where V is the representational space for the Lie group G, and L has

∈

It should be noted that the
an invariance property related to both arguments.
resulting equations of motion, the Euler-Poincare equations, are not the Euler-
Poincare equations for the semidirect product Lie algebra

⊲⊳ V ∗ or

⊲⊳ V .

G

G

So, we have the following:

1. There is a left presentation of Lie group G on the vector space V and G acting

in the natural way on the left on T G

V ∗ : h(vg, a) = (hvg, ha).

×

2. The function L : T G

R is the left G-invariant.

V ∗, Lagrangian La0 : T G

3. Let a0 ∈

R, La0(vg) = L(vg, a0). La0 is the left
invariant under the lift to TG of the left action of Ga0 on G, where Ga0 is the
isotropy group of a0.

→

4. Left G-invariance of L permits us to deﬁne

.

˙a(t) =

ξ(t)a(t),

−

with initial condition a(0) = a0. The solution can be written as a(t) =
g(t)−

1a0.

Then we have four equivalent descriptions of the corresponding dynamics:

1. If a0 is ﬁxed, then Hamilton’s variational principle

La0(g(t), ˙g(t)dt = 0

2. g(t) satisﬁes the Euler-Lagrange equations for La0 on G.

So, we may apply our wavelet methods either on the level of the variational formu-
lation (17) or on the level of the Euler-Poincare equations (19).

E Continuous Wavelet Transform

Now we need take into account the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian structures related
to systems (12) or (19). Therefore, we need to consider generalized wavelets, which
allow us to consider the corresponding structures instead of compactly supported
wavelet representation from paper [1].

In wavelet analysis the following three concepts are used now: 1) a square inte-
grable representation U of a group G, 2) coherent states (CS) over G, and 3) the
wavelet transform associated to U. We consider now their uniﬁcation [10], [11].

Let G be a locally compact group and Ua a strongly continuous, irreducible,
. Let H be a closed subgroup of
G a Borel
G/H. Then we say that U is a square integrable

unitary representation of G on Hilbert space
G, X = G/H with (quasi) invariant measure ν and σ : X = G/H

So, coherent states or wavelets are simply the elements of the orbit under U of
a ﬁxed vector η in representational space. We have the following fundamental

c) The similitude group SIM(n) of Rn(n
axisymmetric n-dimensional wavelets.
d) Also we have the case of a bigger group, containing both aﬃne and Weyl-Hei-
senberg group, which interpolate between aﬃne wavelet analysis and windowed
Fourier analysis: aﬃne Weyl–Heisenberg group [11].
e) Relativity groups. In a nonrelativistic setup, the natural kinematical group is
the (extended) Galilean group. Also we may adds independent space and time
dilations and obtain an aﬃne Galilean group. If we restrict the dilations by the
relation a0 = a2, where a0, a are the time and space dilation, we obtain the Galilei-
Schr¨odinger group, invariance group of both Schr¨odinger and heat equations. We
consider these examples in the next section. In the same way we may consider as
a kinematical group the Poincare group. When a0 = a we have aﬃne Poincare
or Weyl-Poincare group. We consider a useful generalization of that aﬃnization
construction for the case of a hidden metaplectic structure in section III A.

But the usual representation is not square–integrable and must be modiﬁed:
restriction of the representation to a suitable quotient space of the group (the asso-
ciated phase space in our case) restores square – integrability: G
homogeneous
space.
Also, we have a more general approach which allows consideration of wavelets cor-
responding to more general groups and representations [12], [13].

−→

Our goal is to apply these results to problems of Hamiltonian dynamics and as a
consequence we need to take into account the symplectic nature of our dynamical
problem. Also, the symplectic and wavelet structures must be consistent (this must
resemble the symplectic or Lie-Poisson integrator theory). We use the point of
view of geometric quantization theory (orbit method) instead of harmonic analysis.
Because of this we can consider (a) – (e) analogously.

F Bases for Solutions

We consider an important particular case of the aﬃne relativity group (relativity
group combined with dilations) — aﬃne Galilei group in n-dimensions. So, we

)2

have a combination of the Galilei group with independent space and time dilations:
Gaf f = Gm ⊲⊳ D2, where D2 = (R+
R2, Gm is the extended Galilei group

corresponding to mass parameter m > 0 (Gaf f is a noncentral extension of G ⊲⊳
D2 by R, where G is usual Galilei group). The generic element of Gaf f is g =

are time and space dilations. The actions of g on

III SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES, QUANTIZATION

AND FAST WAVELET TRANSFORM

A Metaplectic Group and Representations

Let Sp(n) be symplectic group, Mp(n) be its unique two- fold covering – meta-
plectic group [14]. Let V be a symplectic vector space with symplectic form ( , ),
then R

V is nilpotent Lie algebra - Heisenberg algebra:

⊕

[R, V ] = 0,

[v, w] = (v, w)

R,

[V, V ] = R.

∈

Sp(V ) is a group of automorphisms of Heisenberg algebra.

Let N be a group with Lie algebra R

V , i.e. Heisenberg group. By Stone– von
⊕

i. Let us also consider the projective representation of simplectic

i.e. c is S1-cocycle.

But this representation is unitary representation of universal covering, i.e. meta-
plectic group Mp(V ). We give this representation without Stone-von Neumann
theorem. Consider a new group F = N ′ ⊲⊳ Mp(V ),
⊲⊳ is semidirect product (we
V, S1 = (R/2πZ)). Let V ∗ be dual
consider instead of N = R
to V, G(V ∗) be automorphism group of V ∗.Then F is subgroup of G(V ∗), which

V the N ′ = S1

consists of elements, which acts on V ∗ by aﬃne transformations.
This is the key point!

Let q1, ..., qn; p1, ..., pn be symplectic basis in V, α = pdq =

symplectic form on V ∗. Let M be ﬁxed aﬃne polarization, then for a
a

According to this approach we can construct by using methods of geometric
quantization theory many ”symplectic wavelet constructions” with corresponding
symplectic or Poisson structure on it. Very useful particular spline–wavelet ba-
sis with uniform exponential control on stratiﬁed and nilpotent Lie groups was
considered in [13].

B Applications to Melnikov Functions Approach

We give now some point of application of wavelet methods from the preceding
parts to the Melnikov approach in the theory of homoclinic chaos in perturbed
Hamiltonian systems for examples from [1].

In the Hamiltonian form we have:

˙x = J

For ε = 0 we have homoclinic orbit ¯x0(t) to the hyperbolic ﬁxed point x0. For ε
= 0
we have the normally hyperbolic invariant torus Tε and condition on transversal
intersection of stable and unstable manifolds W s(Tε) and W u(Tε) in terms of Mel-
nikov functions M(Θ) for ¯x0(t):

M(Θ) =

H(¯x0(t))

. This condition has the next form:

M(Θ0) = 0,

According to the approach of Birkhoﬀ-Smale-Wiggins, we determined the region in
parameter space in which we can observe the chaotic behaviour [4].
If we cannot solve equations (34) explicitly in time, then we use the wavelet ap-
proach from paper [1] for the computations of homoclinic (heteroclinic) loops as
the wavelet solutions of system (34). For computations of quasiperiodic Melnikov
functions,

M m/n(t0) =

DH(xα(t))

. we used the periodization of wavelet construction from paper [1].

We also used the symplectic Melnikov function approach in which we have:

is the Poisson bracket and di(z, ε) is the Melnikov distance. So, we need
where
symplectic invariant wavelet expressions for Poisson brackets. The computations
are produced according to invariant calculation of Poisson brackets, which is based
on consideration of part III A and on operator representation from part III F (see
below).

C Floer Approach for Closed Loops

Now we consider the generalization of the wavelet variational approach to the
symplectic invariant calculation of closed loops in Hamiltonian systems [15]. As we
demonstrated in [4] we have the parametrization of our solution by some reduced
algebraical problem; but in contrast to the cases from paper [1], where the solution
is parametrized by construction based on the scalar reﬁnement equation, in the
symplectic case we have parametrization of the solution by matrix problems –
Quadratic Mirror Filters equations. Now we consider a diﬀerent approach.

Let(M, ω) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 2n, ω being a closed
T M. Thus
R corresponds to a

2-form (nondegenerate) on M which induces an isomorphism T ∗M
every smooth time-dependent Hamiltonian H : R

ω(XH(t, x), ξ) =

for ξ
consider the corresponding Hamiltonian diﬀerential equation on M:

TxM. Let H (and XH) be periodic in time: H(t + T, x) = H(t, x) and

∈

(35)

(36)

˙x(t) = XH(t, x(t))

.

The solutions x(t) of (36) determine a 1-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms ψt ∈
Diﬀ(M) satisfying ψt(x(0)) = x(t). These diﬀeomorphisms are symplectic: ω =
ψ∗t ω. Let L = LT M be the space of contractible loops in M which are represented
by smooth curves γ : R
M, satisfying γ(t + T ) = γ(t). Then the contractible T-
periodic solutions of (36) can be characterized as the critical points of the functional
S = ST : L

the space of vector ﬁelds ξ

we have for the 1-form df : T L

and the critical points of S are contractible loops in L which satisfy the Hamiltonian
equation (36). Thus the critical points are precisely the required T-periodic solution
of (36).

To describe the gradient of S we choose a on an almost complex structure on
C ∞(End(T M))

M which is compatible with ω. This is an endomorphism J

Studying the critical points of S is confronted with the well-known diﬃculty that
the variational integral is neither bounded from below nor from above. Moreover,
at every possible critical point the Hessian of f has an inﬁnite dimensional positive
and an inﬁnite dimensional negative subspace, so the standard Morse theory is not
applicable. The additional problem is that the gradient vector ﬁeld on the loop
space L,

does not deﬁne a well-posed Cauchy problem. But Floer [15] found a way to
analyse the space
of bounded solutions consisting of the critical points, together
with their connecting orbits. He used a combination of a variational approach
and Gromov’s elliptic technique. A gradient ﬂow line of f is a smooth solution

which satisﬁes u(s, t+T ) = u(s, t). The key point is to consider (42) not as the ﬂow
on the loop space but as an elliptic boundary value problem. It should be noted
that (42) is a generalization of an equation for Gromov’s pseudoholomorphic curves
MT (H, J), the space of
(corresponding to the case
bounded solutions of (42), i.e. the space of smooth functions u : C/iT Z

which are contractible, solve equation (42) and have ﬁnite energy ﬂow:

us to wavelet representation of closed loops.

note only the problem of relation between quantum and classical evolutions or how

classical one [14]. Our approach to the solution of systems (46), (47) is based on
our technique from [1]-[7] and the very useful linear parametrization for diﬀerential
operators which we present in section III F.

E SYMPLECTIC HILBERT SCALES VIA WAVELETS

We can solve many important dynamical problems so that KAM perturbations,
spread of energy to higher modes, weak turbulence, growth of solutions of Hamil-
tonian equations only if we consider scales of spaces instead of one functional
space. For the Hamiltonian system and its perturbations for which we need take
into account the underlying symplectic structure, we need to consider symplectic
scales of spaces. So, if ˙u(t) = J
K(u(t)) is the Hamiltonian equation, we need
a wavelet description of the symplectic or quasicomplex structure on the level of
functional spaces. It is very important that, according to [16], Hilbert basis is in
the same time a Darboux basis to the corresponding symplectic structure. We
with the symplectic structure [16], [17]. All
need to provide the Hilbert scale

wavelet coeﬃcients or wavelet transforms. As a rule, the faster the wavelet coef-
ﬁcients decay, the more the analyzed function is regular [18]. An example most
important to us is the scale of Sobolev spaces. Let Hk(Rn) be the Hilbert space of

This shows that localization of the wavelet coeﬃcients at a small scale is linked to

So, we need representation for a diﬀerential operator (J in our case) in the wavelet

basis. We consider it in the next section.

Let Qj = Pj

IV MAPS AND WAVELET STRUCTURES

A Veselov-Marsden Discretization

Discrete variational principles lead to evolution dynamics analogous to the Euler-
Lagrange equations [9]. If Q is a conﬁguration space, then a discrete Lagrangian
is a map L : Q
R. usually L is obtained by approximating the given

Lagrangian. For N

B Generalized Wavelet Approach

Our approach to the solutions of Equation (54) is based on applications of general
and very eﬃcient methods developed by A. Harten [20], who produced a ”General
Framework” for multiresolution representation of discrete data. It is based on con-
sideration of basic operators, decimation and prediction, which connect adjacent
resolution levels. These operators are constructed from two basic blocks: the dis-
cretization and reconstruction operators. The former obtains discrete information
from given continuous functions (ﬂows); and the latter produces an approxima-
tion to those functions, from discrete values, in the same function space to which
the original function belongs. A “new scale” is deﬁned as the information on a
given resolution level which cannot be predicted from discrete information at lower
levels. If the discretization and reconstruction are local operators, the concept of

“new scale” is also local. The scale coeﬃcients are directly related to the prediction
errors, and thus to the reconstruction procedure. If scale coeﬃcients are small at a
certain location on a given scale, it means that the reconstruction procedure on that
scale gives a proper approximation of the original function at that particular loca-
tion. This approach may be considered as some generalization of standard wavelet
analysis approach.
It allows the consideration of multiresolution decomposition
when the usual approach is impossible (δ-functions case).

Let F be a linear space of mappings

Dk is a discretization operator. The main goal is to design a multiresolution scheme
SL, but corresponds for those sequences
(MR) [20] that applies to all sequences s
ˆvL

SL, which are obtained by the discretization (56).

Since Dk maps F onto V k then for any vk
that Dkf = vk. Such correspondence from f
the corresponding operator is the reconstruction operator Rk:

V k there is at least one f in F so
V k is reconstruction and

where Ik is the identity operator in V k (Rk is right inverse of Dk in V k).

a ”good approximation” for Dkf . It is very important that each space V L has a

(68) we have a very useful representation for solutions of equations (54) or for dif-
ferent map construction in the forms which are counterparts for discrete (diﬀerent)
cases of construction from paper [1].

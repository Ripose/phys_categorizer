Surfaces roughness eﬀects on the transmission of
Gaussian beams by anisotropic parallel plates

Abstract

Inﬂuence of the plate surfaces roughness in precise ellipsometry experiments is
studied. The realistic case of a Gaussian laser beam crossing a uniaxial platelet
is considered. Expression for the transmittance is determined using the ﬁrst order
perturbation theory. In this frame, it is shown that interference takes place between
the specular transmitted beam and the scattered ﬁeld. This eﬀect is due to the
angular distribution of the Gaussian beam and is of ﬁrst order in the roughness
over wavelength ratio. As an application, a numerical simulation of the eﬀects of
quartz roughness surfaces at normal incidence is provided. The interference term is
found to be strongly connected to the random nature of the surface roughness.

1 Introduction

The high-accuracy universal polarimeter (HAUP) [1] has proved to be a very useful in-
strument to measure the crystal optical properties (see for instance [2, 3, 4] and references
therein). The principle is simple and was introduced a long time ago (see [5] for an his-
torical introduction): the light intensity measured after a rotating high quality polariser,
a crystal plate (the sample) and a high quality rotating analyser, is ﬁtted to a theoretical
formula with several coeﬃcients as free parameters where the delay due to birefringence
and optical activity can be determined.

The accuracy of this instrument has now reached the few 10−5 level and systematic
errors contributing at this order of magnitude have been investigated [6, 7, 8]. The con-
clusion is that roughness is most likely one of the main source of systematic uncertainties.
However, despite an extensive literature on surface roughness [9, 10], no theoretical
expression for the transmission of a Gaussian beam by an anisotropic rough platelet is
available.
It is the purpose of this article to provide this expression. We consistently
take into account the Gaussian nature of the laser beam, the multiple reﬂection inside the
plate and the roughness of both faces of the plate. To simplify the calculations we further
restrict ourselves to uniaxial homogeneous crystals. As a result, we ﬁnd that unlike plane
waves, specular Gaussian beams are aﬀected by the surfaces roughness, even in the ﬁrst
order perturbation theory.

1

The physical origin of this phenomenon is the angular distribution, or plane wave
expansion, of Gaussian beams [11]. Plane waves constituting a Gaussian beam having
diﬀerent wave vectors, a given plane wave can then be scattered in the specular direction
of the other ones. The resulting interference pattern leads to an a priori non vanishing
contribution of the scattered ﬁeld in the specular region. To some extent, this phenomenon
is thus related to the near-specular scattering by rough surfaces introduced in [12].

Another aspect of realistic platelet surfaces is the interface parallelism default. De-
pending on the wedge angle, this default can compete with roughness in the modiﬁcations
of the transmitted beam polarisation. The nature of these eﬀects is however diﬀerent.
Given the relative orientation of the two plate interfaces, the wedge eﬀect is univocal
whereas roughness, as it will be shown in this paper, is of random nature. It is then most
likely that these two eﬀects cannot compensate each other. In principle, the perturba-
tive calculations reported in the present article holds for both eﬀects. Nevertheless, the
boundary matching method, applied a long time ago to isotropic wedges [13], can be used
to describe the wedge eﬀect. We shall report this calulation in a future publication and
restrict ourselves here on platelet roughness.

This article is organised as follows. In section 2 we derive the theoretical expressions

and numerical simulations of quartz plates are presented in section 3.

2 Formalism

The choice of the theoretical formalism is driven by the properties of the crystal plate
surfaces under study. Fortunately, an exhaustive experimental study on crystal surfaces
has recently been published [14]. Most of the high quality polished crystal surfaces used
in optics have a proﬁle surface correlation length of the order of the optical wavelength
and a root mean square roughness of the order of a few angstrœm. It means that one can
safely use a ﬁrst order perturbation theory [15] neglecting the local ﬁeld eﬀects[16]. The
more suitable formalism for our problem is the one introduced in [17] and generalised to
anisotropic overlayers in [18]. However, in the latter reference, the anisotropy is treated
perturbatively and only the reﬂection of plane waves is considered. We shall then extend
this formalism to platelet’s transmission taking fully into account the plate anisotropy
and treating perturbatively the plate roughness.

In the following we tried to be concise, referring to [17, 18] for further details. The

wave equation corresponding to the system represented in ﬁgure 1 is:

Solutions of equation (11) are obtained using the Green’s functions[17, 18]. There
exist, a priori, nine Green’s functions and thanks to the Dirac distributions appearing in
equation (5), they must only be determined for z′ = 0 and for z′

a and z < 0,

all terms of equation (11) is front of the ﬁeld components E′

Hence, the wave equation being expressed as function of the continuous ﬁeld components,
only one non zero Green’s function Gp(K; z, z′) exists[17, 18] in the two relevant regions

where f (z) is a discontinuous function, but with a ﬁnite jump. Although this expression
is not mathematically justiﬁed as stated in [23], it can however be used by considering
that the Heaviside functions of equations (2,4) are given by the limit

Θ(z) = lim
ζ→0

[1 + tanh(z/ζ)]/2 .

This choice is justiﬁed by the freedom existing in the determination of the dielectric
tensor at z = 0 [24]. It is to mention that equation (17) leads to a disagreement with
the boundary matching method for isotropic-isotropic interfaces in the case of oblique
incidence. Another prescription was proposed in [25] to avoid this discrepancy. But, as
mentioned in [26], no general proof was provided in [25]. There is then no reason for this
particular prescription to work also for isotropic-anisotropic interfaces. In addition, since
we are going to restrict ourselves to normal incidence, we choose to use the more intuitive
and symmetric prescription of equation (17) for our calculations.

As w0 → ∞
, the Fourier transforms of the electric ﬁeld components lead to Dirac distri-
butions and the usual plane wave result is recovered. This interference term is therefore

3 Numerical simulations

To estimate the specular-scattered interference term, a laser beam crossing a quartz
platelet at normal incidence is now considered. The incident electric vector is ﬁxed to
e0 = ˆx, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of incidence of the Gaussian beam’s centre, and
the intensities recorded after a Wollaston prism are calculated as in the previous section.

3.1 Numerical ingredients and input parameters

As described in the previous section, the specular-scattered interference term can only
be evaluated if a simulation of the surface roughness is provided. The proﬁles of the
quartz surfaces h0 and ha are thus randomly generated independently. Then the scattered
ﬁelds are computed for various orientations of the optical axis and the two intensities
of equations (24-26) are determined. The procedure is repeated in order to obtain a
statistical distribution of the intensities. The numerical integrations of equations (24-26)
are performed in the domain arctan(K/k) < 1o, which roughly corresponds to the angular
acceptance of a 1 inch diameter optical lens located at 1 m from the plate. In practice
this limit does not aﬀect the value of the interference term but only the second order
contribution.

x, y

Random proﬁle generations are performed as follows. First, the height distributions
are determined according to a Gaussian distribution of mean value zero and root mean
square σ = 6 ˚A. This is a typical value for a high quality polished quartz plate [30]. The
2n nodes. The value
heights are stored in a grid
of n is limited by the computer memory capacity, n = 11 in our case. Next, the Fourier
transform is computed and the proﬁle heights are weighted by the square root of the
two dimensional spectral density function[20] (PSD2). Though we are going to consider
an isotropic roughness distribution, we shall not use the reduced one dimensional radial
PSD1[20, 31]. In doing so we fully account for the random nature of the surface roughness
in the evaluation of the specular-scattered interference term (the use of a PSD1 would
leads to a smaller dispersion of our numerical results).

where the cut-oﬀ spatial frequency Kmin has been introduced to account for the surface
P SD2(0) = 0 [32]. The correlation length l is of the order
proﬁle property < h >= 0
of[30] 1µm and Kmin is smaller than 10−3µm−1 [14]. The parameter 1/Kmin acts as a
spatial frequency threshold for the laser radius: roughly speaking, for w0 > √2/Kmin the
Gaussian beam behaves as a plane-wave and the specular-scattered interference term van-
ishes. Nevertheless, the present values of Kmin are limited by the acceptance of the surface
proﬁle measurements: values as small as 10−4µm−1 for Si substrates[32] and 10−5µm−1
for Kmin for Si wafers [33] have been reported (notice that these numbers lead to a laser
radius threshold greater than 15 mm). Finally, the inverse Fourier transform is computed
leading to a ‘coloured’ random surface.

The grid parameters are determined by the correlation length l and the laser waist
w0. The distance between two nods of the grid
must be at least twice smaller than
{
ten times smaller than √2/w0
l and the distance between two nods of the grid
approximately. This leads to the following ‘experimental’ parameters: w0 = 100µm,
l = 1.6µm and L = 8w0. As for the laser wavelength we choose λ = 0.6328 µm and
n0 = 1.542637 and ne = 1.551646. The ratio σ/λ is therefore of the order of 10−3 in our
numerical examples.

Using the numbers given above, we have written a computer program to estimate the
specular-scattered interference term. Calculations of the unperturbated electric ﬁelds and
of the Green’s functions are performed according to [27]. A fast Fourier transform (FFT)
algorithm is used for the simulation of the surface roughness and for the integrals of the
kind of equation (23). The numerical precision for the unperturbated intensities is of the
order of 10−6[27]. The specular-scattered interference term is thus known to an accuracy
10−9 (with our grid size, the FFTs do not reduce this accuracy).

However, the CPU-time is quite sizable: with a SPECfp2000 1288 computer, the random
generation of the surfaces takes 22 s and next the computation of the intensities for one
given orientation of the optical axis takes 183 s.

surface proﬁles.

Each curve of these plots corresponds to diﬀerent surface proﬁles. Considering one
given proﬁle, one can notice that: the size of the specular-scattered interference strongly
depends on the surface proﬁle and can reach the per mill level of the zero order contribu-
tion, its sign changes with φc and its shape is not regular with φc. The change of sign is
expected since the intensity averaged over a large number of proﬁles obviously vanishes.
The erratic shape is also expected since the ﬁelds change with φc and so do the Fourier
transforms as the one of equation (23).

The second order contribution (calculated from equation (26)) is six order of magnitude
smaller that the zero order contribution. However, we do not show any results since our
second order calculation is not complete concerning the specular angular range.

Large diﬀerences are indeed observed when the plate thickness is changed. The
specular-scattered interference contributions are computed for a = 0.562 mm as in [8] (i.e.
(8 + 10−3)
2π retardation plate with our choice for the optical indices) and a = 5 mm
as in [7] (i.e. (71 + 0.18)
2π retardation plate), and still with θc = π/2. They are
compared to the values obtained with the tenth order quarter wave plate and the same
surface proﬁles.

To investigate the dependence of equations (19,14) on the optical axis polar angle θc,
the calculations were performed ﬁxing θc = π/4 for the plate thickness a = 0.720 mm.
Here again the variations are noticeable (see ﬁgures 5 and 6).
Looking at ﬁgures 4 and 6, one can remark that I [1]
y

tends to be of opposite sign in
the regions 0 < φc < π/2 and π/2 < φc < π. But this is not a general rule as it seems
to come out from experiments [8, 7]. One can also observe two ﬁx points at φc = 0 and
π/2 on ﬁgures 4 and 6. I [1]
y being the interference between the scattered ﬁeld and the
zero order ﬁeld, these ﬁx points correspond to the zeros of the zero order ﬁeld (see I [0]
y
on ﬁgure 2). This is not the case for the second order term of equation (26) which is
of the order of 10−6 and therefore dominates around φc = 0, π/2 (here the missing term
of equation (26) is not relevant since it describes the interference between the specular
and the second order scattered ﬁelds). However, the dispersion of I [1]
y around zero for
φc = 0, π/2 (not visible on these ﬁgures) defers very slightly from zero, it is of the order
10−8 for w0 = 25 µm. This is a cross-polarisation eﬀect,
of 10−10 for w0 = 100 µm and
i.e. this is due to the matrix M3×3 in equations (20-22).

the same for the four curves.

The numerical results presented here are rather independent of the choice for the
PSD2 provided a quartz plate of optical grade is considered. It is indeed experimentally
demonstrated [14, 20, 31, 32, 33] that the PSDs of optical element’s surface have an
inverse-power-low (or Fractal-like) behaviour. Therefore, various smooth mathematical
representations of the PSD (see [34, 35] for examples) are reducible to equation (27) as it
is justiﬁed in [31].

As a concluding remark, we point out that three important dimensionless parameters
ω0/l, σ/λ and l/λ have been encountered in our calculations (ω0/λ describes the cross-
polarisation eﬀects discussed above and is therefore not relevant here).

As mentioned in section 2, the validity of the perturbation treatment depends on σ/λ
and l/λ. Using the ﬁrst order perturbation theory, the severe conditions σ/λ
1 and
l/λ
1 must hold[15]. They are fortunately fulﬁlled by optical grade quartz plates. To
study the inﬂuence of the correlation length l, we changed the value of l to 0.7µm and 2µm
and we observed no signiﬁcant qualitative diﬀerences with respect to the results described
above.

As for the last dimensionless parameter ω0/l, we already mentioned that when ω0/l
→
the usual result for plane waves is recovered (i.e. the specular-scattered interference
∞
term vanishes) although, with regard to the cut-oﬀ parameter Kmin, this limit seems to be
idealistic for a ﬁnite size quartz plate. To get an idea of the inﬂuence of w0, we increased it
to 200µm and here again, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed. Much larger values for
w0 could not be tried, keeping a reasonable correlation length, because of the computer
l corresponds to the
memory limitation. Finally let us mention that the other limit ω0 ≪
scattering by gratings [36]. In this limit the specular-scattered interference term vanishes
since the diﬀusion occurs at large angle with respect to the specular beam direction.

4 Conclusion

We have computed, in the leading order perturbation theory, the eﬀect of surfaces rough-
ness on uniaxial platelets transmittance. Taking into account the Gaussian nature of
laser beams we showed that the interference between the specular and scattered ﬁelds
contributes to the intensity measurement performed in the specular region.

This contribution is of ﬁrst order in the ratio of the root mean square roughness over
the laser wavelength σ/λ. It depends strongly on the plate surfaces proﬁles and on the
crystal optical properties, orientation of the optical axis, thickness and optical indices
It is therefore useless to implement the roughness calculation in a
(i.e. temperature).

HAUP type of ﬁtting procedure (in addition, the numerical calculation are computer
time consuming).

In view of our numerical results, it is most likely that simple overlayer models [8] can-
not describe accurately the dynamical properties of our main formula equations (14,19).
Nevertheless, we point out that, because of the random property of the specular-scattered
interference term, a simple way to avoid it is to perform a series of measurements at
diﬀerent locations on the plate and then to average the results. Although this proce-
dure would increase the uncertainty on the determination of crystal optical parameters,
it should however decrease the systematic bias. The determination of the plate thickness
in situ could be done by varying the laser incident angle (i.e. by tilting the plate) [37].

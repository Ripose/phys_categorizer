VOLUME FREE ELECTRON LASERS

1.Introduction

There has been recently considerable theoretical and experimental interest in the con-
cept of free electron lasers (FELs) [1,2]. It has been shown that free electron lasers can
operate due to diﬀerent radiation processes: ”magnetic bremsstrahlung” in the undulator,
Smith-Purcel and Cherenkov radiations, radiation in the laser wave. Independing on spon-
taneous radiation mechanism being principle for a deﬁnite FEL scheme, all existing FEL
devices use for the feedback forming either two parallel mirrors placed at the ends of the
working area or one-dimentional diﬀraction grating in which transmitted and diﬀracted
(reﬂected) waves propagate along the electron beam velocity direction (one-dimentional
distributed feedback (DFB)) (Fig.1,2).

Figure 2: Smith-Purcel FEL (orotron).

According [3], the dispersion equation of the FEL in the collective interaction regime
is reduced to that of the conventional travelling wave ampliﬁer [4] and the FEL gain at the
conditions of synchronism is proportional to ρ1/3
,where ρo is the density of the electron
beam.

The volume FEL has been suggested as one of the alternative schemes of FEL which
provides possibility to design compact sources in various spectral ranges including ultra-
violet and X-ray [5-10].

The main peculiarity of VFEL is the use of one, two or three-dimensional grating as

a volume resonator providing three-dimensional distributed feedback (Fig.3-5).

It is important to emphasize that even one-dimensional diﬀraction grating may provide
non-one-dimensional (volume) feedback if the diﬀracted wave moves in nonback direction
(the Bragg diﬀractive angle does not equal π
2 ). This results in essential modiﬁcation of
the VFEL gain and lasing processes providing, under speciﬁc conditions, more eﬀective
radiation process as compared with conventional FELs using one-dimensional distributed
feedback. The VFEL gain at the conditions of synchronism is proportional to ρ1/S+1
where S is the number of diﬀracted waves. Volume FEL, if realised, could be made with
much more compact device structure compared with the conventional FEL and therefore,
may be interesting for applications in diﬀerent wavelength regions: from submillimeter to
X-ray [5-9].

It should be emphasized that a fast destruction of the synchronism condition between
a particle and an emitted electromagnetic wave is characteristic for the VFEL scheme
with an electron beam passing through a diﬀraction grating. This leads to the essential

increase of the generation threshold parameters. The reduction of the inﬂuence of multiple
scattering becomes possible when electron beam moves either in the split of a grating
(vacuum VFEL) or over a surface of a grating (surface FEL, SFEL) at a distance d
λγ
(Fig.3-5)(λ is the photon wave length, γ is the Lorentz factor) [10]. The SFEL has been
studied in [8].

≤

It is easy to understand that vacuum VFEL turns into SFEL when width of the grating

split grows.

Radiation mechanisms being the basis of VFEL and SFEL can be various (Cherenkov,
Smith-Purcel and so on). The spontaneous surface parametric radiation (SSPR) [10] may
be used for SFEL, for example. We should distinguish the SSPR from Smith-Purcel
radiation [11,12].

The diﬀerence between these two types of radiation may be shown by analysing the
radiation frequency dependence on electron energy. In the case of Smith-Purcel radiation
the photon frequency is proportional to:

ω

∼

1
1
γ2 + θ2

and, for photons emitted at small angles to the electron velocity, the radiation frequency
depends on the electron energy as γ2. Moreover, this wave propagates in vacuum.
In the case of SSPR, the frequency of photons emitted even at small angles to the electron
velocity does not practically depend on the electron energy but is determined by the
Bragg condition. This radiation propagates inside the grating and leaves it only through
a grating-vacuum boundary. The microscopic nature of both types of radiation is similar:
they are stipulated by the medium atoms polarisation caused by an electromagnetic ﬁeld
of a moving charged particle.

Figure 6: Smith-Purcel FEL and parametric quasi-Cherenkov VFEL comparison.

In the Smith-Purcel FEL (orotron, diﬀraction radiation generator) (see [13-17] ) an
electron beam passes over a reﬂecting diﬀraction grating, two mirrors (or diﬀraction grat-
ing) are used for one-dimensional feedback forming (Fig.2).

4

In the VFEL the non-one-dimensional feedback forming by the diﬀraction grating is

used (Fig.3-5).

In the present paper the equations describing the VFEL lasing in case of an electron
beam moving either in a split of a diﬀraction grating or in a vacuum waveguide containing
a diﬀraction grating (vacuum VFEL)(Fig.3,4) have been obtained. The dispersion equa-
tion allowing to ﬁnd the vacuum VFEL gain in one-mode generation regime have been
considered.

2. Basic formulas describing vacuum VFEL lasing.

The interaction of an electron beam and an electromagnetic wave propagating along
a waveguide in the vacuum VFEL is described by the Maxwell and electron movement

Let us consider a sheet electron beam passed over a diﬀraction grating placed in a
plane waveguide. At ﬁrst view this generator is similar to Smith-Purcel FEL (orotron
or diﬀraction radiation generator) [3, 13-16]. But, in the volume FEL the radiated wave
wavelength λ is of the same order as the diﬀraction grating period, the wave undergoes
Bragg diﬀraction on the Bragg angle non-equal to π
2 and the diﬀraction grating provides
the volume distribution feedback. Let the (y, z) coordinate plane be parallel to the waveg-
uide (diﬀraction grating) surface. In the absence of the electron beam the current ~j = 0
and the density ρ = 0. Equations (1, 2) become periodic in y, z directions (they are not
periodic in x-direction). In this case the waveguide dielectric susceptibility can be written
as:

ε (~r, ω) = ε0 (x) + χ (~r, ω) ,

(7)

where ε0 (x) = 1 in vacuum, ε0 (x) = ε0 in the area of the grating disposition, χ (~r, ω) is
the space periodic permittivity discribing the diﬀraction grating.

Let the permittivity χ (~r, ω) be the periodic function of y and z:

χ (~r, ω) =

χτ (x) e−i~τ ~η,

X~τ 6=0
where ~η = y~e2 + z~e3 is the two-dimensional vector, ~e2(3) is the unit vector along y(z) axis
and ~τ = τy~e2 + τz~e3 is the reciprocal lattice vector of the diﬀraction grating.

In the case χ = 0 the set of equations (1, 2) desribes passing of the electromagnetic
waves in the plain waveguide which contains the layer of the matter. The dielectric
susceptebility of the matter is ε0. The waveguide eigenmodes
and eigenvalues κn
are well known [18]. They can be used for simplifying the three-dimensional Maxwell

Equations (8,6) allow us to ﬁnd the electromagnetic ﬁeld ~E(~r, ω) radiated by electron
beam. It is well known that gain and the generation threshold can be ﬁnd in the linear
approximation. In this case the beam current ~j is the linear function of ~E(~r, ω): ~j = ~j0+δ~j,
~E(~r, ω) is
where ~j0 is the beam current not perturbated by the radiated ﬁeld, δ~j
the beam current induced by the radiated ﬁeld.
In the linear approximation the set
of movement equations (6) may be solved by the following way: the electromagnetic
ﬁeld ~E (~rα(t), ω) in the right side of equations (6) can be represented as ~E (~rα0 + ~ut, ω),
~rα0 + ~ut, ~rα0 is the initial coordinate of the electron, ~u is the electron

similar set of equations for volume FEL depends on ~k.

As a result, we can conclude that all the main results obtained for VFELs holds true
for the vacuum VFEL. First of all, the non-trivial solution of system (27) exists only when
the determinant of the system is equal to zero. This allows us to obtain the dispersion
equation for ~kk and ω:

According to [5-8] the study of the dispersion equation let us ﬁnd the condition of the
appearance of the convection and absolute instability of the beam and, as a result, obtain
the gain and the generation threshold.

Equations (29), (30) coincide with the equations describing the wave spectrum for

Let the waveguide contains a diﬀraction grating (χnn

Equation (32) describes the electromagnetic wave spectrum for the waiveguide containing

charge density. Let us study the solutions of (28) near the point where the left side of
(28) is equal to zero. The solution of (31, 32) in the vicinity of the exact Bragg condition

can be equal to zero. In this case equation (36) can be written as

Let us remind that the Langmuer frequency ωL ∼

have been obtained a very important result: in vacuum VFEL both Imkz and the gain are
proportional to n1/4
for the deﬁnite orientation of the diﬀraction grating in the waveguide
in contrast with the conventional one-dimensional FEL for which the gain is proportional
to n1/3

on the length is represented in Fig.7.

CONCLUSION

The vacuum VFEL ampliﬁcation and the generation process develop more intensively
then in ordinary FEL using one-dimensional distributed feedback. Such the VFEL, if
realised, could be made with much more compact device structure compared with the
FEL and therefore, may be interesting for applications in diﬀerent wavelength ranges:
from submillimeter to X-ray. Such the VFEL can be realised on the basis of the existing
accelerators.

Author is gratefull to K. Batrakov for the help in the threshold current densities

computer simulation carrying out.

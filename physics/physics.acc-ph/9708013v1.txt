Abstract

Electron bunches with charge densities ρ of the order of 102 to 103 [nC/cm3], energies
between 20. and 100. [MeV], peak current > 100 [A], bunch lengths between 0.3
and 1.8 [cm], and bunch charge of 2.0 to 20. [nC] are relevant to the design of Free
Electron Lasers and future linear colliders. In this paper we present the results of
numerical simulations performed with a particle in a cell (pic) code of an electron
bunch in a drift tube. The electron bunch has cylindrical symmetry with the z-axis
oriented in the direction of motion. The charge density distribution is constant in
the radial and Gaussian in the longitudinal direction, respectively. The electron
bunch experiences both a radial pinch in the middle of the pulse, corresponding to
the peak electron density, and a signiﬁcant growth of the correlated emittance. This
behavior is explained, and an approximate scaling law is identiﬁed. Comparisons of
the results from the pic and PARMELA codes are presented.

1 Introduction

New designs of Free Electron Lasers and high-brightness colliders require the
modeling of electron bunches with higher charge densities than have previously
been studied. In this high-charge regime, self-ﬁelds must be handled consis-
tently. “Particle-in-a-cell”, or pic, codes must therefore be employed instead
of the commonly-used “particle-pusher” codes, such as PARMELA, which do
not account completely for self-ﬁelds. We studied the simple case of a bunch
traveling along a drift tube in order to gain a better understanding of the
self-ﬁeld eﬀects in this high-charge regime. We have completed a detailed se-
ries of calculations using a pic code (detailed below) on a range of energy
and electron charge where signiﬁcant disagreement between pic and “particle-
pusher” codes has been found. Our results display rather severe self-pinching
of the bunch under certain circumstances, implying the existence of a radially
inward-directed force which we explain analytically.

The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a discussion of the
forces acting on an electron bunch, the origin of the radial pinching, and an
estimate of the initial space charge potential. Section 3 contains numerical
results of the pic code, a discussion of the scaling parameters, and comparison
between the pic and PARMELA codes results. Section 4 contains a summary
of the paper and conclusions.

2 Radial pinching force and space charge potential

It is well known [1,2] that for an inﬁnitely long relativistic electron beam,
traveling in the positive z-direction and having constant electron density along
z, the outward-directed radial space charge force is nearly balanced by the
inward-directed Lorentz force. The electron beam is thus subjected to a small
net defocusing eﬀect. In this section we show, for the case of a ﬁnite length
electron bunch, the origin of a radial force which is directed inward and which
generates a pinch in the electron bunch envelope as seen in Figure 1. The
motion of the particles is in the positive z-direction, cylindrical symmetry is
assumed, and the relative longitudinal particle position in the bunch is denoted
by ζ, where ζ = z

zc, and zc is the z-position of the center of the bunch.

We assume, following [3], that all the electrons travel along z with uniform
velocity v = β0c, no transverse velocity component is present, and the density
ρ(r, z) is given by

density distribution, Q is the pulse charge with appropriate sign, and a is the
electron bunch radius. We further assume that the z- and t-dependencies of
the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld B in Maxwell’s equations are combined
in the variable s. This ansatz is appropriate when the electrons have a common
longitudinal velocity β0 and no transverse motion. This assumption is violated,
as shown by the numerical simulations, after the bunch drifts a signiﬁcant
distance. It is, however, useful to establish the conditions for the onset of the
radial pinching force. The region in which we will solve Maxwell’s equations
is the inside of a perfectly conductive drift tube of radius b.

In view of the symmetry of the problem, only the E0

of the ﬁelds are present. The superscript ()0 is used to indicate that the ﬁelds
are computed in the absence of any transverse velocity.

2.1 Calculation of the radial force

The zeroth order calculation of the radial force, F 0
s , neglects the electron radial
motion induced by the space charge and Lorentz force, i.e. the electron bunch
moves as a solid body. F 0
s is the sum of the radial space charge force and the
Lorentz force arising from the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld B0
θ and the longitudinal
velocity of the electrons:

It is simple to verify that the integral is always real and negative, thus the
radial force is directed outward and corresponds to a defocusing of the electron
pulse. This result is a simple generalization of the one obtained in [1,2] for an
inﬁnitely long electron beam.

The ﬁrst order correction to the radial force includes the eﬀect of the electron
radial motion. Inspection of the transverse phase space plots, (x′, x), where

The numerical calculations indicate that the electron radial excursion and its
energy change is quite limited in the initial phases of the pinch. Hence, the
radial momentum equation can be integrated at the onset of the constriction

Eq. (19) indicates that, at suﬃciently large zc values, the radial force will be
turned inward. The expression for zs shows that high charge and low energy
beams will become more constricted than their counterparts with lower charge
and higher energies. For an electron bunch with Gaussian longitudinal charge
density distribution, such as the one considered in this paper, E0
r peaks at the
center of the pulse. Consequently, the maximum constriction will also occur
at the center of the pulse as has been observed in the numerical calculations.

2.2 Calculation of the space charge potential

An estimate of the initial space charge potential at the beginning of the drift
region has been made via the following procedure. The space charge potential
Φ′ is ﬁrst computed in the electron rest frame K′ which moves along z with
velocity v = β0c relative to the laboratory frame K. In K′, the electrons are
stationary, the electron relative motion is neglected, the electric potential is a
well-deﬁned quantity, and it satisﬁes the Poisson equation. Φ′ is then trans-
formed back into the laboratory frame K, where, from energy conservation, it
is translated to an equivalent ∆γ. The details of the procedure are as follows:

Φ′(ζ ′, r) =

z(η, r) = Φ′(ζ, r) =

In the derivation of Eq. (24), the electrons are assumed to be strictly stationary

3 Numerical simulation results

The numerical calculations of a cylindrical, axisymmetric electron bunch in
a drift tube with perfect wall conductivity were performed with the “particle
in a cell” code ARGUS [5]. ARGUS is a fully three-dimensional and time-
dependent (x, y, z, t) solver for Maxwell’s equations. We used the “pic” solver
option.

We also compared ARGUS results to the calculations from the standard
code PARMELA [6]. PARMELA was originally developed at Los Alamos Na-
tional Laboratory and is widely used within the accelerator community. In
PARMELA, the forces between the electrons are computed in the electron
rest frame where all the electron relative motion is neglected.

3.1 ARGUS results

The electron bunch is generated at z = 0, and the electron density conforms to
Eq. (1). The total electron bunch length in our simulation is 5.0 σ’s. σ varies

7

from 0.1274 to 0.7644 [cm]. The bunch radius a varies from 0.1 to 0.3 [cm],
the electron energy E from 20. to 100. [MeV], and the charge Q from 2.0 to
18.0 [nC]. The electrons are injected with uniform βz, and βx = βy = 0.

In the code the electrons are represented by “macro particles”. The density
of the macro particles is uniform, but the charge is weighted to reproduce
the appropriate charge density distribution. The drift tube, as represented in
ARGUS, is shown in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. Drift tube geometry in ARGUS. The positive z-axis is oriented in the direc-
tion of the bunch motion.

The drift tube radius is 1.5 [cm] and the length is 30.0 [cm]. The number of
grid points along x and y is 57, and the number along z varies from 192 to
571. The spacing in x and y is not uniform: the smaller spacing (0.02 [cm]) is
used in proximity of the z-axis of the tube, and the larger spacing (0.163 [cm])
in the vicinity of the wall. The spacing along z is constant. The time step,
0.35 [ps], is selected such that the Courant condition is satisﬁed everywhere.
This condition is vp∆t
∆xmin/2, where vp is the particle velocity, ∆t is the
≤
time step, and ∆xmin is the smallest grid spacing.

In Figure 3 the evolution of the (x, ζ) bunch envelope at diﬀerent positions
in the drift is shown. In view of the cylindrical symmetry of the electron
bunch, the (x, ζ) envelope is identical to the (y, ζ) one. At zc = 0. the cross
section is uniform, in the interval 10. < zc < 20. [cm] a small pinch develops,
and at zc = 30. [cm] a fully evolved pinch has been established. The largest
pinch occurs in the middle of the bunch in correspondence to the maximum
radial force as also seen in Eq. (19). A close inspection of the bunch envelope
reveals a tapering of the rear half. The wake ﬁelds from the front half may be
responsible for this behavior.

In Figure 4 the evolution of the longitudinal phase space, γβz vs ζ, is pre-
sented for the same case as in Figure 3. In the inset of Figure 4(a) we have
overlapped, with an expanded scale, the results of Eq. (24) with the ARGUS
calculations for purpose of comparison. Here, the lower curve corresponds to
r = 0 and the upper one to r = a. The agreement is quite satisfactory in
view of the simplifying assumptions made in our analytical formulation. As
the pulse drifts in the tube, the relative electron motion increases, and a more
complex longitudinal phase space evolves.

smaller than the total pulse emittance of 18.5 [π mm-mrad] at the end of the

Fig. 8. Various longitudinal (ζ, x) bunch envelopes at drift location zc = 30. [cm].
For (a)–(d), a = 0.1 [cm]. Bunch parameters:
(a) Q = 2.0 [nC], σ = 0.1274 [cm], b = 0.25 [cm], E = 50. [MeV], γ0 = 98.84
(b) Q = 2.0 [nC], σ = 0.1274 [cm], b = 0.25 [cm], E = 100. [MeV], γ0 = 196.69
(c) Q = 2.0 [nC], σ = 0.7639 [cm], b = 0.25 [cm], E = 20. [MeV], γ0 = 40.13
(d) Q = 6.0 [nC], σ = 0.3822 [cm], b = 1.5 [cm], E = 20. [MeV], γ0 = 40.13.

The evolution of the pinch ratio as a function of the position in the drift tube is
shown in Figure 9(a). Here, rmin/a, the ratio of the minimum bunch envelope
radius divided by the initial bunch radius, is plotted versus the position in the
drift tube for three diﬀerent values of the bunch energy. Higher energy bunches
undergo less pinching than lower energy ones. In Figure 9(b), rmin/a is plotted
versus the normalized bunch center position, zc/zs. The three separate curves
of Figure 9(a) nearly collapse into a single one, thus showing that Eq. (18)
correctly captures the energy scaling of the pinch ratio.

Finally, in Figure 11 the evolution of the pinch ratio is shown as a function
of zc/zs for bunches of diﬀerent lengths, identical transverse cross sections
and diﬀerent charges selected to maintain a constant electron density. Unlike
the previous cases, the pinch ratio is not well parameterized by zc/zs. The
probable explanation for the inability to parameterize the present case is that
the wake ﬁelds of the particles in the leading edge of the bunch are not properly
accounted for in our simple theory.

3.2 Comparison of ARGUS and PARMELA results

ARGUS and PARMELA yield quite diﬀerent results for identical bunch con-
ditions. In Figure 12 the transverse phase space, as computed by ARGUS and
PARMELA at zc = 30. [cm], is shown. The PARMELA phase space reﬂects
only a mild defocusing eﬀect due to the space charge. The ARGUS counterpart
combines the focusing and defocusing due to the pinching force.

the complexity of the longitudinal momentum distribution within the bunch.

4 Summary and Conclusions

We have presented the results of extensive numerical simulations of electron
bunches with charge densities ρ of the order of 102 to 103 [nC/cm3] and energies
between 20. and 100. [MeV]. The results indicate the presence of a strong
pinch in the middle of an electron bunch with a Gaussian longitudinal electron
density distribution. The pinching force scales approximately as γ−3/2 and r1/2.
This force generates an increase in the correlated bunch emittance, and the
space charge depression is also aﬀected. A simpliﬁed analysis to explain these
results has been described. The results are in signiﬁcant disagreement with
the ones obtained from the standard accelerator code PARMELA. This is
attributed to the neglect of the electron relative motion in the space charge
calculations performed in PARMELA.

The pinch eﬀects we have uncovered will play a signiﬁcant role in the pho-
toinjectors used in Free Electron Laser and other high-brightness accelerators.
Here, the electron pulse has very low energy, and this will limit the allowed
charge density in order to avoid undue pinching and space charge eﬀects. The
break up of the electron bunch at the photoinjector has been observed [7,8]

15

and attributed solely to the longitudinal component of the space charge force.
The pinching force discussed in this paper may also play a role. In addition,
the design of magnetic pulse compressors will need to account for the pinch
which may become signiﬁcant in the last stage of the compression.

Further analytical studies and numerical simulations are necessary to better
understand (a) the evolution of the pinch as zc → ∞
and (b) the eﬀect of the
longitudinal electron density distributions. Preliminary indications are that
uniform longitudinal charge density distributions become pinched at multiple
positions in the bunch. The pinch period depends upon the pulse parame-
ters. More importantly, experimental observation of the pinch is needed to
completely validate these results.

SSDC facilities, Dr. John Petillo for technical support for ARGUS, and Dr.

I. ELECTRON AND PROTON SPIN POLARISATION IN STORAGE
RINGS — AN INTRODUCTION a

This article provides a uniﬁed introduction to the theory of electron
and proton spin polarisation in storage rings and it provides a common
starting point for the written versions of the four talks that I gave at
Monterey.

1 Foreword

Each of the four talks that I gave at Monterey had to do with spin polarisation in
storage rings and accelerators and in each talk I covered the relevant and necessary
aspects of the theory. Indeed, three of the talks essentially dealt only with theory
and there was considerable repetition of the basics. If the written versions were to
reﬂect the talks as I delivered them, there would again be repetition but there would
also be an apparent lack of connection between those topics which were speciﬁc to
each talk. Thus a reader who survived reading all four articles might still not have a
solid view of the connections between the concepts covered. So it seems appropriate
to provide a common introduction to the theory. That is the burden of this article.
This also provides a suitable opportunity to present a synthesis of the various ways
of describing the competition between polarisation build–up and depolarisation for
electrons that I have come across or contributed to over the last decade. Moreover it is
an opportunity to lay to rest some confusions that have crept into the subject. Owing
to space limitations I will not attempt to maintain a high degree of mathematical
rigour but aim instead to impart a feeling for the issues and for our current level of
understanding. I shall refer to this article as Article I.

2 Introduction

Spin behaviour in the electromagnetic guide ﬁelds of storage rings is dominated by
two eﬀects:

Spin precession

•

•

Spin ﬂip due to synchrotron radiation emission b.

In existing proton rings and those that will be built in the foreseeable future only spin
precession is of signiﬁcance since the synchrotron radiation power emitted by protons
is negligible. However, as pointed out by Sokolov and Ternov in 1964, radiative spin
ﬂip can, for electrons, lead to a build up of polarisation [1]. This phenomenon is then
commonly known as the Sokolov–Ternov (ST) eﬀect c. At the time of writing, the
only known practical way of obtaining a stored polarised proton beam is to inject
a prepolarised beam provided by a suitable source [2] and then accelerate it. Nev-
ertheless another method has been suggested and I will comment on that in Article
III.

In the remainder of this article I will provide a uniﬁed overview of spin precession
and spin ﬂip and show how to arrive at an eﬃcient description of their combined
eﬀect.

3 Spin precession

Spin precession for particles travelling in the electromagnetic ﬁelds in storage rings
is most conveniently described in terms of the Thomas–Bargmann–Michel–Telegdi
(T–BMT) equation [3, 4, 5]:

The vector ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld, ~E is the electric ﬁeld and γ is the Lorentz factor.
The vectors ~r and ˙~r are the position and velocity and evolve according to the Lorentz
bBut it will become clear later that the distinction between the two can become blurred in storage
rings. Indeed resonant spin ﬂip in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments can be viewed either as
ﬂip due to photon absorption or precession by π around an eﬀective horizontal ﬁeld.

have their usual meanings. The derivations of the T–BMT equation by its authors
were purely classical in spirit. The derivation by BMT was based on the requirements
of relativistic covariance. However, Thomas combined conventional notions of spin
precession with the relativistic eﬀect now called Thomas precession [3, 5] d. Note
that Eqs. (1) and (2) reduce smoothly to the usual nonrelativistic limit. To obtain a
clearer view of the implications of the T–BMT equation one can rewrite it in terms
of the ﬁeld components perpendicular and parallel to the orbit:

where for this part of the discussion the eﬀect of electric ﬁelds has been ignored.
Eq. (3) shows that for motion perpendicular to the ﬁeld, the spin precesses around
the ﬁeld at a rate 1 + aγ faster than the corresponding rate of orbit deﬂection:

δθspin = (1 + aγ)δθorbit = aγδθorbit + δθorbit

(4)

in an obvious symbolic notation. This precession rate is strongly inﬂuenced by the
Thomas precession. This is contained in the term 1/γ
1. For electrons (g
2) the
total precession is strongly suppressed. For protons (g
5.58) the relative suppression
is much weaker.

However, ‘spin’ is a purely quantum mechanical concept. Moreover, we are not
working in a regime where electron–positron creation and annihilation are important.
Thus a two–component description of spin should suﬃce and one should therefore
look for a Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation (Article V) of the Dirac Hamiltonian
(containing a ‘Pauli’ term for the anomalous magnetic moment) appropriate for the
semiclassical regime of a storage ring. By ‘semiclassical’ I mean that for the high
energies involved it should only be necessary to keep terms up to ﬁrst order in ~. A
Hamiltonian of the required type was already written down in 1973 by Derbenev and
Kondratenko (DK) [6] and takes the form e

Thus the DK Hamiltonian consists of a purely orbital part of zeroth order in ~
and a spin part of ﬁrst order in ~. The orbital part resembles the familiar form
of the classical relativistic Hamiltonian from the textbooks [7] and the spin part is
reminiscent of a Stern–Gerlach (SG) dipole energy term. As will be noted in Article
V, at second order in ~ this Hamiltonian gains just extra orbital terms. All in all,
the DK Hamiltonian has a satisfying and physically transparent form. It is then no
surprise that in ﬁrst order in ~ the Heisenberg equation of motion (EOM) for the
kinetic momentum ~πop is the Lorentz equation with an additional term for the SG
force. It is also clear that in ﬁrst order in ~ the Heisenberg EOM for the spin (~/2)~σop
is a precession equation with the same form as the T–BMT equation, Eqs. (1) and
(2), since the operator ~Ωop has a structure equivalent to that of ~Ω in Eq. (2). In a
wave packet approximation and at ﬁrst order in ~ the Heisenberg EOM lead to the
(= the polarisation) and the EOM
T–BMT equation for the expectation value
for the expectation value
of the kinetic momentum of a wave packet is again
the Lorentz equation modiﬁed by a SG term [8]. Thus we have now put the T–BMT
equation on a ﬁrm quantum mechanical footing and have shown that it is the natural
outcome of a semiclassical approximation. Moreover (see Article V), we know how to
calculate beyond ﬁrst order in ~ if necessary. Note that the magnetic SG terms diﬀer
from the familiar textbook forms for slowly moving particles but reduce to them at
low energy: our terms contain Thomas precession contributions so that, for example,
g/2 is replaced by g/2
1 + 1/γ = a + 1/γ. A detailed discussion on the SG terms
in the DK Hamiltonian and on the SG forces allowed by covariance can be found in
[9] where the EOM are given a classical interpretation. See also Article III.

4 Spin distributions

In the last section it became clear that to ﬁrst order in ~ the centres of wave packets
move (classically) according to the usual Lorentz force modiﬁed by a SG term and that
the accompanying
obeys the T–BMT equation. Thus for many purposes
the particles and their spins can be treated as if they are classical objects and we
are then in a position to move beyond single particles and to discuss classical spin
and phase space distributions. Article V shows how to arrive at spin and particle
distributions directly from the density operator.

Since storage rings and accelerators have accelerating cavities which subject the parti-
cles to time dependent ﬁelds and since the magnet geometry is ﬁxed, particle dynamics
is best described in terms of the canonical coordinates ~u = (x, px, z, pz, ∆t, ∆E) where
x, px, z, pz describe transverse motion with respect to the curved periodic orbit and
∆t, ∆E are the time delay relative to a synchronous particle (at the centre of the
bunch) and the energy deviation from the energy of a synchronous particle respec-
tively. The independent variable is now the distance around the ring, s. There is a
corresponding (classical) Hamiltonian, correct up to ﬁrst order in ~,

f If we were working to second or higher order in ~ we would use the Moyal algebra [10, 11]. In the
present case of ﬁrst order in ~ this simpliﬁes to the Poisson algebra.

which enables the EOM to be written in canonical form and this is derived from hdk
by standard means [12]. If the ring is distorted (see below), ~u describes the position
with respect to the resulting closed orbit.

We now make the idealisation that the beam phase space can be described in
terms of a smooth continuous density, w(~u; s), which is a scalar function of ~u and
the azimuth s g. It is normalised to unity. In the absence of dissipation and noise
(e.g. due to synchrotron radiation) and ignoring the eﬀect of the tiny SG forces on
the orbital motion, w is constant along a phase space trajectory and obeys a relation
of the Liouville type:

if w is the same from turn to turn, then it is periodic
If the beam is stable, i.e.
in s and we write it as weq so that weq(~u; s) = weq(~u; s + C), where C is the ring
circumference.

Having assigned a phase space density to each point in phase space we now assign
a polarisation ~P (~u; s) to each point h. ~P is the average over particles of the unit spins
2~ξ/~ at (~u; s). Since the T-BMT equation is linear in the spin and since in this picture
the spins at (~u; s) all see the same ~˜Ω(~u; s), ~P (~u; s) obeys the T-BMT equation

which is analogous to Eq. (17) and assumes that ~P (~u; s) is diﬀerentiable in all direc-

if ~P (~u; s) is the same from turn to turn, then
If the spin distribution is stable, i.e.
~P (~u; s) not only obeys the T-BMT equation, but it is also periodic in s and we write
it as ~Peq so that ~Peq(~u; s) = ~Peq(~u; s + C). We denote the unit vector along ~Peq(~u; s)
by ˆn(~u; s) i. This also obeys Eq. (18) and is periodic in s: ˆn(~u; s) = ˆn(~u; s + C).
On the (periodic) closed orbit ˆn(~u; s) becomes ˆn(~0; s) and we denote it by ˆn0(s) j.
gNote that in Article V the phase space density is denoted by ‘ρ’.
h This is equivalent to associating a spin density matrix with each point in phase space.
i With respect to ˆn(~u; s) the spin density matrix at (~u; s) is diagonal.
jMany authors make no clear distinction between ˆn and ˆn0 and many use the symbol ˆn for ˆn0.
This can sometimes lead to confusion. In particular the original symbol for ∂ ˆn/∂δ (section 5.3) was
γ∂ ˆn/∂γ [6] and some have erroneously understood γ∂ ˆn/∂γ to mean E0∂ ˆn0/∂E0 where E0 is the
design energy.

Obviously ˆn0(s) obeys the periodicity condition ˆn0(s) = ˆn0(s + C), i.e. ˆn0(s) is the
ring periodic solution of the T–BMT equation on the closed orbit. In general it is
unique.

In the foregoing I introduced the invariant (vector) spin ﬁeld ˆn(~u; s) by appealing
to physical intuition. The underlying assumption was that the ﬁeld ˆn(~u; s), which is
supposed to obey Eq. (18) over the whole of the beam phase space, not only exists
but is smooth (to correspond with our expectations of the spin distribution in a real
beam) and is unique. However, the situation is not quite so simple as I will now
explain by describing some qualitative aspects of spin motion.

≈

440 MeV (

If a circular accelerator only had vertical (dipole) ﬁelds, vertical spins would not be
aﬀected and ˆn0(s) would be vertical. Moreover, according to Eq. (3) a non-vertical
spin would precess around ˆn0(s) aγ times per turn with respect to the (periodic)
design orbit. I call the quantity aγ the ‘naive spin tune’. It represents the natural
spin precession frequency of this simple system. It increases by one unit for every
523 MeV ) increase in the energy of electrons (protons). But some

rings contain vertical bend magnets so that the design orbit is not ﬂat. The ring
In these cases a periodic
might also contain solenoidal ﬁelds of particle detectors.
T-BMT solution, ˆn0(s), on the design orbit still exists but is no longer everywhere
vertical and it is given by the real eigenvector (with unit eigenvalue) of the one turn
(orthogonal) 3 x 3 spin transfer matrix for this design orbit k. Indeed, for the HERA
electron ring (Article II) ˆn0 is made longitudinal at the east IP by means of spin
rotators. The number of spin precessions around ˆn0(s) per turn is extracted from the
complex eigenvalues of the matrix [19, 20]. We call this the ‘real spin tune’ or just
the ‘spin tune’ and denote it by νspin. In general it deviates from aγ l.

If the spin tune were an integer, the one turn matrix would be a unit matrix
and ˆn0(s) would not be unique. This lack of uniqueness also manifests itself in
extreme sensitivity to ﬁeld errors. The quadrupoles and other magnets in storage
rings normally have unavoidable small misalignements so that the periodic (closed)
orbit deviates from the design orbit. Likewise the real ˆn0(s) deviates from the design
ˆn0(s) since a spin on the closed orbit now ‘sees’ horizontal dipole components in the
quadrupoles. There is also a small shift in the real spin tune. The angle between the
two ˆn0(s)’s is roughly proportional to the amount of closed orbit distortion. But it
becomes very large if the design spin tune is close to an integer [21, 22] since the spin
motion is then coherent with the imperfection ﬁelds. The spins are then said to be
near an integer resonance (sometimes called an ‘imperfection resonance’).

Particle bunches in storage rings have nonzero transverse dimensions and energy

eigenproblem for ˆn(~u; s) since in general a spin at (~u; s) set parallel to ˆn(~u; s) does not map into
itself over one turn. Thus the naive algorithm based on a one turn map (e.g. see page 27 in [15]) is
incorrect; in general a ‘ˆn’ constructed in that way would not obey the T–BMT equation everywhere
along an orbit. As a result, a ‘ˆn’ constructed in that way should not be used to obtain the vector
∂ ˆn/∂δ needed, as in section 5.3, to describe radiative depolarisation of electrons (e.g. see page 52 in
[16]). However, ˆn can be obtained as an eigensolution of a modiﬁed eigenproblem [17, 18]. See also
footnote j.
lActually, the complex eigenvalues only deliver the fractional part of the spin tune. The integer part
must be found by following the spin motion for one turn.

spread and the motion of a spin, compared to that of a spin on the closed orbit,
depends on the position in phase space via the ~u in ~˜Ω(~u; s). For particles circulating
for many turns the total disturbance to a spin can grow to become very big if there
is coherence between the natural spin motion and the oscillatory motion in the beam
characterised by the spin-orbit resonance condition:

tiﬁed with the imperfection resonances already mentioned and driven by the periodic
imperfection ﬁelds along the closed orbit. We have absorbed their inﬂuence into a
large deviation of ˆn0(s) from the design direction. The spin-synchrobetatron reso-
nances (

are driven by the quasiperiodic ﬁelds seen by particles executing quasiperiodic syn-

chrobetatron oscillations about the closed orbit. The sum
the order of the resonance. An imperfection resonance is then a zeroth order reso-
nance. Although I have just been discussing the behaviour near resonance of arbitrary
spins it should now be clear that ˆn, which is a special solution of Eq. (18) constrained
to be periodic, should, just like ˆn0(s), also show extreme behaviour near resonances.
This is conﬁrmed by the analytical structure and numerical output from the algo-
rithms used for its construction [21]. Near integer resonances in a distorted ring ˆn0
deviates strongly from the nominal direction for the perfectly aligned ring and near
intrinsic resonances the diﬀerence ˆn(~u; s)
ˆn0 becomes large and increases with the
synchrobetatron amplitude ~u and with aγ m.

For 27.5 GeV electrons in HERA (see Article II) the r.m.s. angle between ˆn(~u; s)
and ˆn0 (obtained by averaging across phase space) is just a few milliradians away
from intrinsic resonances and about 100 milliradians very near such resonances. For
protons at about 800 GeV in HERA (see Article III) on the ‘1–σ’ torus this angle is
typically 60 degrees unless Siberian Snakes are employed. Figure 1 depicts invariant
spin ﬁelds ˆn ‘attached’ to vertical betatron phase space ellipses for three diﬀerent ﬁxed
energies but for the same invariant vertical emittance. Other examples are given in
Article III.

Although I introduced ˆn via spin distributions, the history of ˆn took a diﬀerent
course which provides more insight into its meaning and properties.
It was ﬁrst
introduced by Derbenev and Kondratenko [25, 6] in the process of obtaining action–
angle variables for combined spin–orbit motion by ‘diagonalising’ the Hamiltonian in
Eq. (12) and this aspect was further illuminated in [26]. A similar approach can be
used on the Hamiltonian in Eq. (16) [12, 27, 26, 28]. I now give a rough outline of
the basic ideas.

It is assumed that the orbital motion is integrable and one makes an s dependent
canonical transformation so that ˜horb is replaced by ¯horb = Σi2π ¯Qi ¯Ii where the ¯Qi
m Note that the terminology ‘intrinsic’ and ‘imperfection’ must be used with care since synchrobe-
tatron motion can also give rise to zeroth order resonance phenomena [23, 24].

are the three orbital tunes and the three ¯Ii are the components of the orbital action
vector ~¯I. Then one describes the spin motion with respect to a set of orthonormal
axes (a ‘dreibein’) (ˆn1(~u; s), ˆn2(~u; s), ˆn3(~u; s)) attached to each point in phase space
and requires that ~ξ

actions ~¯I. The vectors ˆn1 and ˆn2 are not solutions of the T–BMT equation. The
vector ˆn3 has just the properties of the vector ˆn introduced earlier. This choice of the
dreibein, which amounts to a ~u and s–dependent rotation of the axes for describing
the spin motion, is achieved by a suitably designed ~u and s–dependent canonical
transformation which delivers a ﬁnal Hamiltonian (correct to ﬁrst order in ~) with
the ‘diagonalised’ form [26]

where ˇIspin = ~ξ
ˆn3 is now an integral of motion, the spin action, and the ˇQi and ˇIi are
the corresponding orbital tunes and actions. The ˇIi diﬀer from the ¯Ii by SG terms
[26]. Note that the concept of spin tune has now been generalised; instead of the
closed orbit spin tune νspin we have a spin tune ˇν(~¯I) depending on the orbital actions
(but not on ˇIspin) which diﬀers slightly from νspin and which reduces to νspin for zero
orbital actions o. Now, in retrospect, the deﬁnition of resonance must be reﬁned;
we should really use ˇν(~¯I) in Eq. (21) instead of νspin. It should now be clear why
we sought a deﬁnition of spin precession rate, i.e. spin tune, which makes the latter
independent of orbital phases and the azimuth s. Spin tune should tell us something
about the degree of long term coherence between the spin motion and the orbital
motion and allow us to express this coherence by means of resonance relations like

Eq. (21) (with ˇν(~¯I)). But if we work with a ‘fake spin tune’ such as that obtained
from the one–turn eigenproblem (see footnote k and [29]) which depends on orbital
phases so that the ‘fake spin phase advance’ per turn varies from turn to turn, we
can make no statements about long term coherence. With this redeﬁnition of spin
tune the dreibein (ˆn1, ˆn2, ˆn3) is unique except at spin–orbit resonances [26, 30] and
by this uniqueness the vector ˆn3 is just the vector ˆn introduced earlier except for a
possible diﬀerence of sign! The exotic (unstable) behaviour of ˆn near resonance is a
manifestation of lack of uniqueness at resonance.

Now I return to the questions of smoothness and existence of a ˆn obeying Eq.
(18). Since ˇν depends on orbital actions, ˆn is potentially nonunique at almost all
points in phase space because the resonance condition is satisﬁed almost everywhere
if we include resonances of arbitrarily high order. Thus ˆn might not be diﬀerentiable
in all directions in phase space [31]. However, algorithms, both perturbative and
nonperturbative, for constructing approximations to ˆn are available [21] (see also
Article III ) and experience with calculating ˆn by the author and colleagues seems to
indicate that resonance eﬀects rapidly become weak as the resonance order increases
so that only a limited number of relatively low order resonances are likely to cause
trouble. Therefore in the remainder of the article it will be assumed that the spin
ﬁeld ˆn is a legitimate tool in practice. Nevertheless, the technical and interesting
matters of existence and smoothness are under active investigation [32] and knowledge
gained from this study will be incorporated in our treatment of spin distributions.
An example of the dependence of ˇν on amplitude can be found in [29].

An extension of the numerical work reported in [29] but carried out just before
this article was completed indicates that ˇν actually ‘jumps over’ resonant values as
the orbit amplitude is changed [33, 34]. That work is based on the ‘stroboscopic
averaging’ algorithm in the computer code SPRINT [30]. But even more recent
results from a new version of the SODOM algorithm [17, 18] corroborates these
ﬁndings. This implies, contrary to traditional expectations based on perturbation
theory, that the spin–orbit resonance condition of Eq. (21) is never exactly satisﬁed
in non–perturbative calculations. However, near to resonance, ˆn still exhibits exotic
behaviour.

{

ˆn, ~ξ
}

Although ˆn and ~ξ both obey the T–BMT equation they are very diﬀerent objects;
ˆn is a function of the dynamical phase space variables but ~ξ is a dynamical spin
variable and by Eq. (14) the Poisson bracket
vanishes. Now that we have a
classical integral of motion for the spin, namely ˇIspin, we recognize ˆn as a phase space
dependent semiclassical quantisation axis corresponding to the quantum observable
(~/2)~σop
ˆn. We also see that the quantisation axis coincides with the direction of the
equilibrium spin ﬁeld. As we will see later (~/2)~σop
ˆn is a key object in the analytical
theory of equilibrium electron polarisation and indeed it was originally introduced as
an aid to calculating the electron polarisation [25, 6]. The analysis becomes more
complicated if the orbital motion is nonlinear but in practice one tries to use an optic
for which the nonlinear eﬀects have been minimised and tries to restrict the beam to
a phase space volume such that the motion is almost integrable.

·

·

One last point on the virtues of ˆn: a calculation of electron polarisation with the

10

computer program SODOM [17] which exploits ˆn agrees well with a calculation using
the Monte–Carlo spin tracking program SITROS [35] which contains no notion of ˆn.
The material on spin distributions presented in this section is applicable both to
electrons and protons. The application to protons is the topic of Article III so that
for the remainder of this article I will focus on electrons and in particular on the
modiﬁcations by synchrotron radiation to the concepts already presented.

5 The eﬀects of synchrotron radiation

it
Synchrotron radiation (SR) emitted by stored electrons has three main eﬀects:
determines the phase space distribution and it brings about spin polarisation owing
to spin ﬂip associated with synchrotron radiation (the ST eﬀect) but the stochastic
element of SR also causes depolarisation. Thus SR brings polarisation but it also takes
it away! As we have seen already and as we will see below spin motion is irrevocably
intertwined with the orbital eﬀects. I will begin by summarising the orbital dynamics
and then discuss the polarisation and depolarisation eﬀects in detail.

5.1 Orbital phase space

Although SR spectra can be estimated by classical means [5] SR is fundamentally
a quantum phenomenon; it consists of single photons so that one can only make
reliable predictions by using quantised radiation theory. One then ﬁnds corrections
to the classical spectrum [36]. The work of Huang and Ruth [37] presented at this
meeting is a good example of recent quantum calculations.

Most of the SR in conventional storage rings is generated in the ﬁelds of the dipole
magnets deﬁning the design orbit. A quantum treatment for this case of the eﬀects
of SR on the orbital phase space distribution was carried out in 1975 [38] using the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (10). I will return to this later but here I will follow another route
which has the advantage of exhibiting the transparency needed for this article.

Photon emission in the dipole ﬁelds is largely incoherent and detailed calculations
show that one can consider the photons to be emitted over short distances of the
order of ρ/γ where ρ is the orbit radius p. Furthermore in practical storage rings
the energy loss per turn of a single particle is small compared to the nominal energy.
Thus the dissipative eﬀect is weak and for example in HERA (Article II) an electron
at 27.5 GeV loses about 80 MeV per turn. Then for many purposes it suﬃces to
describe the radiation reaction power p(s) from SR using a classical model in which
smooth classical radiation reaction power pcl(s) is overlayed with a ‘delta correlated’
(‘white’) stochastic component δp(s):

p(s) = pcl(s) + δp(s) ,

where the parameter R quantiﬁes the intensity of the noise and depends on the design

pAt this point I recommend the reader to consult the chart of time scales for electron dynamics
Indeed, an appreciation of these time scales is
in [15]. We will need this on several occasions.
indispensible for understanding the physics of electron storage rings.

The equations for ~u of deterministic orbital motion derived from a Hamiltonian
are then modiﬁed by inclusion of damping and stochastic terms and in the (very
good) approximation that the photons are emitted parallel to the particle trajectory
and neglecting interparticle interactions the resultant linearised stochastic diﬀerential
equation describing motion with respect to the closed orbit can be used to construct
the Fokker–Planck equation for the evolution of the phase space density [39, 40, 41, 42]
q. I write this as

A central property of Eq. (24) is that w(~u; s) reaches equilibrium with w(~u; s) =
w(~u; s + C) within a few damping times. At HERA at 27.5 GeV the longitudinal
(design energy)/(energy loss
damping time is about 7 milliseconds
per turn) [43]. Furthermore w(~u; s) is gaussian and since the radiation eﬀects are
weak, w(~u; s) is very close to being a solution of the radiationless transport equation
Eq. (17) but with the radiation eﬀects determining the beam size and causing a tiny
ripple in the emittances r as functions of s.

Now that we understand the eﬀects of SR on orbital phase space we can move on

to spin.

5.2 The Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect

Only a very small fraction of the radiated photons cause spin ﬂip but for electron
spins aligned along a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, the
ﬂip rates diﬀer and this
leads to a build-up of spin polarisation antiparallel to the ﬁeld. Positrons become
polarised parallel to the ﬁeld. The transition rates for electrons are [1]:

However, the ﬁelds in storage rings are far from uniform but since the system

So the polarisation settles down aligned with ˆn0(s), the periodic solution to the

The above formulae show that in the absence of stochastic motion the maximum

attainable polarisation is 92.38% instead of 100%. Why should this be?

At the simplest level the reason is clear: the probability for reverse spin ﬂip is
nonzero (Eq. (25)). Nevertheless, ‘lay observers’ often imagine that spin ﬂip has
something to do with spin’s trying to reach the lowest energy level of the two levels
of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic ﬁeld and that once the spin is in its lowest level
it will stay there. Then 100% polarisation would be achieved. Also, reverse ﬂip by
radiation emission would defy energy conservation.

However, we are not dealing with spins at rest but with spins ‘sitting’ on relativistic
electrons which already have quantised orbital energy levels so that the prohibition of
reverse ﬂip by energy conservation no longer applies. From Eq. (5) applied to electrons
in a uniform vertical magnetic ﬁeld it is clear that the energy change associated with
spin reversal from up to down is (1+aγ = γ(1/γ
1+g/2)) larger than the separation
of orbital energy levels ~ωc where ωc is the angular frequency of the orbit. So one
could naively imagine spin ﬂip occuring without radiation but simply by a change of
orbital energy level. A related phenomenon involving exchange of orbital and spin
energy has been proposed by Derbenev [47, 12] while commenting on the possible use
of transverse SG forces in storage rings. See Article III.

−

Note also that the splitting of spin energy levels is not simply proportional to
g/2 but contains a Thomas precession term, which indicates that the spin motion
is coupled to the orbital motion. Furthermore, the average energy of a synchrotron
radiation photon is tens of KeV. This is many orders of magnitude greater than the
separation of spin levels. Moreover, photons emitted during spin ﬂip tend to have
higher energies than those emitted without spin ﬂip. In addition, the polarisation
1.2
does not reverse its sign with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld at g = 0 but at g
[6, 36, 44]. This results from the fact that (1/γ
1 + g/2) appears in the Hamiltonian
hdk
int (Eq. (10))instead of just g/2.

≈

−

Finally, it is interesting to note that the synchrotron radiation spectrum and the
polarisation eﬀects just depend on the curvature (i.e. the geometry) of the orbit [44].
So the same eﬀects could be obtained by using electric ﬁelds to bend the trajectory
instead of magnetic ﬁelds.

These comments should convince the reader that in the laboratory frame we are
not dealing with a simple two level spin system. For further discussions relevant to

14

this topic the reader is directed to the articles by W. G. Unruh and J.D. Jackson in
these proceedings and elsewhere [36].

5.3 Radiative depolarisation

The stochastic element of photon emission together with damping determines the
equilibrium phase space density distribution. The same photon emission also imparts
a stochastic element to the ~u in ~˜Ω(~u; s) and then, via the T-BMT equation applied to
spin motion in the (inhomogeneous) focusing ﬁelds and in a simple classical picture,
spin diﬀusion (and thus depolarisation) can occur [48]. The polarisation level reached
is the result of a balance between the Sokolov–Ternov eﬀect and this radiative depo-
larisation. In practice, depolarisation can be strong and it is therefore essential that
it is well understood.

But how can we calculate the equilibrium polarisation? After all, the polarisation
at a point in phase space is the average of the unit spins 2~ξ/~ contained in a small
packet of phase space at that point. Now, for protons, the phase space density is
conserved along a trajectory so that no particles are lost from such a packet but
for electrons their stochastic motion means that spins are continually diﬀusing from
packet to packet. For the orbital motion one then employs a Fokker–Planck equation
for the particle density. But polarisation is not a density so that it is not immediately
clear how to proceed. Moreover the ST eﬀect must be included so that an analogue
of the BKS expression for stochastic orbits is needed. I will mention the best solution
to this puzzle later but in the meantime I will follow a path which roughly reﬂects
the way that estimates have been made in practice.

A clue to the next step is contained in the above comments about the equilib-
rium phase space distribution resulting from weak dissipation. There, the phase
space distribution settles down to a distribution close to an invariant solution for the
dissipationless problem but with the widths of the distribution determined by the
radiation. Assuming that one has signiﬁcant asymptotic polarisation the character-
istic depolarisation time must be similar to the polarisation time, namely minutes or
hours. Both are orders of magnitude larger than the orbital damping times. Thus the
analogue for the polarisation would be that the direction of the equilibrium polarisa-
tion at each point in phase space would settle down close to the equilibrium solution
of the radiationless problem, namely ˆn(~u; s). Furthermore, the ‘spin emittance’ i.e.
the average of ˇIspin = ~ξ
ˆn at each point in phase space, would be independent of ~u
and s.

·

As has been customary I will now adopt these plausible notions as working as-
sumptions that at equilibrium a) the polarisation is parallel to ˆn(~u; s) and b) the
value of the polarisation is independent of ~u and s. In particular, it is assumed that
the spin tune hardly varies across phase space so that there are no ‘local’ spin–orbit
resonances and therefore no polarisation ‘absorbers’. I will oﬀer support for the ﬁrst
assumption at the end of this article but in the meantime some support for these
assumptions comes from noting that by integrating the BKS equation along a deter-
ministic synchrobetatron orbit the polarization settles down very nearly parallel to

15

ˆn [49] in analogy with the solution on the closed orbit (Eq. 32) t. Furthermore, a
study of a special but exactly solvable model of spin diﬀusion [14] shows that far from
resonance the polarization settles down asymptotically very nearly parallel to ˆn.

This picture was ﬁrst proposed by Derbenev and Kondratenko [6]. In the absence
ˆn is conserved. But in the presence of radiation one has

of radiation sn = (~/2)~σop

This is evaluated in the equations following Eq. (4.2) in [6] and by writing ~s =

(~/2)~σop the essence of the physics can be stated (very) symbolically in the form:

·

=

i
~ [hdk

rad + hdk

int, sn] .

dsn

=

d~s

~n + ~s

d~n

·

The ﬁrst term describes the rate of change of sn due to pure spin ﬂip at a point
in phase space (pure ST eﬀect). The consequent build–up of polarisation is a ‘spin
damping’ analogous to orbital damping. The second term describes the change in sn
due to the fact that when a photon is emitted, the particle jumps without a change
of spin to a new position in phase space where it ﬁnds a new ˆn which will in general
not be parallel to the ˆn at the initial point. The projection of the spin on the ˆn–axis
has thus decreased stochastically so that sn diﬀuses in analogy with the diﬀusion of
the orbital actions. This is where the depolarisation comes in. Thus the eﬀect on the
polarisation of the stochastic journey of a particle though phase space is accounted
for by deﬁning an appropriate quantisation axis at each point in phase space. Photon
emission imparts both transverse and longitudinal recoils to the electron but since
a photon is emitted typically within an angle 1/γ with respect to the direction of
the electron, the eﬀect of the longitudinal recoil (i.e. the energy jump) dominates:
the electron remains at almost the same point in x and z but can suﬀer a signiﬁcant
change in energy. Then by neglecting the eﬀect of transverse recoil Derbenev and
Kondratenko arrive at the following expression for the equilibrium polarisation along
the axes ˆn:

The eﬀect of transverse recoil can also be included but contributes derivative terms

The nice thing about this formulation is that a very complicated calculation of
the eﬀects of radiation has been distilled into a formula involving a few strange coef-
ﬁcients (emanating from the radiation theory) and a classical solution to the T–BMT
equation, namely ˆn whose behaviour encapsulates all of the depolarisation eﬀects.

To get high polarisation, one must have (∂ˆn/∂δ)2

1 in dipole magnets. If ˆn is
independent of the position in phase space, the derivative is zero: all points in phase
space have the same quantisation axis and there is no depolarisation. But storage
ring ﬁelds are inhomogeneous so that ˆn varies across phase space. Thus the vector ∂ ˆn
∂δ
depends on the optic of the machine. The optimisation of the optic required to make
∂ˆn/∂δ small is called spin matching [21]. This will be mentioned again in Article II.
An example can be found in [52].

≪

The term linear in ∂ˆn/∂δ in Eq. (36) is due to a correlation between the spin
orientation and the radiation power [15, 53]. Alternatively, it can be considered to
result from the interference between the two terms in Eq. (35). In rings where ˆn0 is
horizontal due, say, to the presence of a solenoid Siberian Snake [54], ∂ˆn/∂δ has a
vertical component in the dipole ﬁelds. This can lead to a build-up of polarisation
(‘kinetic polarisation’) even though the pure Sokolov–Ternov eﬀect vanishes. The rate
is τ −1
dk .
The expression for τ −1

dk in Eq. (38) can be found from a purely classical calculation
of spin diﬀusion by evaluating the eﬀects of the second term in Eq. (35) or by other
means [25, 27, 39, 21] and indeed this was the ﬁrst use for ˆn [25]. Then we have a mixed
calculation: the spin ﬂip is described by quantum mechanics and the depolarisation is
described by classical diﬀusion. But obviously kinetic polarisation will not be found
by that route and the exotic resonance structure examined in Article IV would be
missed. So it is clear that a quantum mechanical approach is needed to get the full

17

picture. An observation of kinetic polarisation [54] would be a nice vindication of this
viewpoint.

The Derbenev-Kondratenko formula (Eq. (36)) has been rederived in a very ele-
gant way by Mane [55]. He introduces the concept of generalised spin ﬂip whereby
he calculates the transition rates due to photon emission from ‘spin up along
∆ph; s)’ where
ˆn(x, px, z, pz, ∆t, ∆E; s)’ to ‘spin down along ˆn(x, px, z, pz, ∆t, ∆E
∆ph is the energy of the emitted photon. One also needs the corresponding ‘spin
down’ to ‘spin up’ rates. Then by requiring that the polarisation has the same value
over all of phase space and imposing the constraint that the total generalised up–
to–down rate equals the total down–to–up rate, and solving for the polarisation one
arrives at Eq. (36)! In this formulation, the concept of depolarisation never arises!
Instead one just has a statistical spin equilibrium. In a perturbative calculation of
(∂ˆn/∂δ)2
in powers
[55] one ﬁnds a series expansion in powers of emittances, i.e.
h
of ~, in which each term contains a product of resonance denominators which impart
the resonant structure to ˆn. As the order of ~ increases along the series so does the
order of the resonances contained in the successive terms.

−

i

Apart from the calculation of Bell and Leinaas (Article IV), there are two further
quantum calculations which should be mentioned, namely those of Hand and Skuja
[51, 56]. They choose ˆn0 as the spin quantisation axis. When a photon is emitted, the
electron jumps to a new orbit. By writing the phase space coordinates as functions
of the radiation ﬁelds and including damping phenomenologically, they calculate the
rates of spin ﬂip along ˆn0 [51] and obtain an expression for the equilibrium polarisation
which is equivalent to the Derbenev–Kondratenko–Mane (DKM) expression in the
limit in which the derivatives of ˆn are evaluated in the linear approximation as in the
SLIM formalism [21, 19, 20]. Thus they only ﬁnd the ﬁrst order spin–orbit resonances
[21]. Indeed, since their (quantum) representation of the orbit has a form similar to
the classical representation in [57] their ﬁnal expression contains terms which are
equivalent and identical in form to terms obtained in [57] in a model of classical
spin diﬀusion. The fact that they only ﬁnd ﬁrst order resonances can then be traced
to their use of just a ﬁrst order perturbative calculation and the choice of ˆn0 as
quantisation axis. To ﬁnd the higher order resonances one should use ˆn. However, in
a second calculation [56], again using ˆn0, they calculated to higher order and although
the outcome is not very transparent, the terms beyond the leading order in ~ contain
high order resonant behaviour. But in the end the moral seems to be that it is more
eﬃcient to choose a quantisation axis (i.e. an unperturbed eigenstate), namely ˆn,
which reﬂects the physics and invest the numerical eﬀort in working with this. In this
respect the DKM formalism provides a clean practical framework in which to calculate
higher order eﬀects. Radiation ﬁelds can cause spin ﬂip. Now we can see how, by
treating the external ﬁelds experienced by the spin as functions of the radiation ﬁelds,
spin precession can be regarded as spin ﬂip as suggested at the beginning.

We have seen that there are several ways to approach the estimation of the equilib-
rium polarisation. In practice analytical calculations are carried out using the DKM
formalism and this has been a successful and essential tool for predicting the main
qualitative features of polarisation in electron storage rings. However, I now present
an approach which is in many ways more satisfying.

5.4 Phase space and polarisation evolution equations

Earlier, while discussing the diﬃculty of ﬁnding a Fokker–Planck treatment for the
polarisation I promised further insights and they follow now.

We have seen that the orbital phase space density w obeys the Fokker–Planck
equation, Eq. (24). Then if the ST eﬀect is ignored and it is recognised that spin is a
passenger subject to the T–BMT equation it may be demonstrated using a classical
picture [14, 58] that the spin diﬀusion is described by the ‘Bloch’ equation:

∂ ~
P
∂s

=

+ ~˜Ω

~
P

,

~
P

∧

LF P,orb

where ~˜Ω was deﬁned by Eq. (16) and ~
is the ‘polarisation density’ which is deﬁned
P
as 2/~
(density in phase space of spin angular momentum). The Bloch equation
for the polarisation density is linear and it is universal in the sense that it does not
contain the phase space density [14]. It is also valid far from spin–orbit equilibrium.
So the trick is to work with the polarisation density instead of the local polarisation
(~u; s) = ~P (~u; s)w(~u; s) and then by combining
~P (~u; s). It is simple to show that ~
P
Eqs. (17) and (19) it is already clear that in the absence of radiation, ~
obeys the
P
radiationless limit of Eq. (39), namely Eq. (40) below. The evolution equation for
the local polarisation in the presence of radiation is obtained by combining Eq. (24)
with Eq. (39). One ﬁnds that it has a more complicated form than Eq. (39) owing to
the presence of the second derivatives in the
LF P,orb. It also contains the phase
space density so that it is not universal. But the local polarisation can always be
obtained instead as ~
P

The ST eﬀect can be included by adding in terms from the BKS equation multi-
plied by the phase space density, together with some terms to represent the interfer-
ence between ST eﬀect and diﬀusion[14] and in fact the full Bloch equation for the
polarisation density and the Fokker–Planck equation for the phase space density can
be obtained from quantum radiation theory [38].

From here it is easy to see, in analogy with the case of the phase space, that since
the orbital damping, orbital diﬀusion and ST terms are very small compared to the
remaining symplectic and T–BMT terms, the equilibrium (i.e. periodic) ~P (~u; s) will
indeed be almost parallel to ˆn(~u; s), at least away from resonances v.

The Bloch equation for the polarisation density is free from assumptions of the
kind we needed earlier and in principle it allows us to calculate everything we need
from scratch by looking at the beam as a whole instead of focusing on individual
particles to begin with. It is clearly the best starting point for discussing radiative

it is unsafe to employ ˆn as the appropriate quantisation axis. The above discussion should be an
adequate response.

polarisation. Furthermore, the spin diﬀusion part (Eq. (39)) can be set up for any
source of noise in the orbital motion — we just need the appropriate
LF P,orb. For
example it could be applied to scattering of protons by gas molecules.

Conclusion

Spin polarisation in high energy storage rings is an exciting and exotic topic. I hope
that the reader now has a solid overview of the status of our understanding and will
pass on to Articles II, III, IV and V. An overview of the experimental aspects of
electron polarization and plans for the future can be found in [60, 61].

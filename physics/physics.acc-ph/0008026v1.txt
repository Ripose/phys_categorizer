We study the energetics of wake excitation during the laser-plasma interaction in application to
laser wakeﬁeld accelerators. We ﬁnd that both the wake amplitude and the accelerating eﬃciency
(transformer ratio) can be maximized by properly shaping the longitudinal proﬁle of the driving laser
pulse. The corresponding family of laser pulse shapes is derived in the nonlinear regime of laser-
plasma interaction. Such shapes provide theoretical upper limit on the magnitude of the wakeﬁeld
and eﬃciency by allowing for uniform photon deceleration inside the laser pulse. We also construct
realistic optimal pulse shapes that can be produced in ﬁnite-bandwidth laser systems.

Current plasma accelerators can be broadly subdivided
into two classes – the laser driven scheme [1], and the
electron beam driven scheme [2]. While the accelerat-
ing plasma waves excited in these two schemes are very
similar, the physics of wakeﬁeld excitation is quite diﬀer-
ent between them. In the beam-driven Plasma Wakeﬁeld
Accelerator (PWFA) the electron beam loses energy to
the plasma through interaction with the induced elec-
trostatic ﬁeld, while in the laser-driven Laser Wakeﬁeld
Accelerator (LWFA) energy loss occurs via photon red-
shift or deceleration [3]. This process is due to the pres-
ence of wake-induced stationary modulations in the re-
fractive index of the plasma as seen in the laser comoving
frame [4]. With the recent advances in laser technology,
the creation of ultrashort pulses with virtually arbitrary
temporal proﬁles is now possible by using amplitude and
phase pulse shapers [5]. Since perturbations to the refrac-
tive index of the plasma depend on pulse shape, diﬀerent
laser shapes will vary in their coupling to the plasma. A
natural question therefore arises: what laser shape is the
“optimal” for laser-plasma accelerators?

The number of parameters involved in selecting a par-
ticular pulse shape can be overwhelming. One can char-
acterize a shape by the value of its total energy, length,
maximum laser ﬁeld, amplitude of plasma wake, etc., in
addition to an inﬁnite-dimensional space of actual shape
functions. Luckily, not all of these parameters are inde-
pendent or even well-deﬁned. In this Letter we argue that
the only two meaningful parameters that describe a laser
shape from the stand point of wake excitation are the
total pulse energy and its depletion length. Using these
parameters diﬀerent laser shapes can be consistently clas-
siﬁed and cross-compared while desired properties such
as wake amplitude or eﬃciency can be optimized.

Let us consider a homogeneous unmagnetized plasma
which is charge neutral, at rest, and has initial density
np in the absence of electromagnetic wave. Laser propa-
gates along the z axis with initial frequency ω0 ≫ ωp ≡

p4πe2np/me. In the laser comoving frame, the plasma

1

response can be written in terms of the independent di-
mensionless variables ζ = kp(z − vgt) and τ = kpct,
where kp is the plasma wavenumber, and vg ≈ −c is the
laser group velocity (for convenience the laser is mov-
ing in the negative z direction). Introducing dimension-
less normalized scalar and vector potentials φ(ζ) and
a(ζ), the parallel and perpendicular electric ﬁelds are
Ek = −(mc2kp/e)∂φ/∂ζ and E⊥ = −(mc/e)∂a/∂t =
−(mc2kp/e)∂a/∂ζ. The wakeﬁeld generation equation
can then be written as [6,7]:

d2x
dζ2 =

ne
np

− 1 =

2(cid:16) 1 + a2(ζ)

x2

− 1(cid:17),

(1)

where ne is the perturbed electron plasma density, x ≡
1 + φ is the modiﬁed electrostatic potential, and a2(ζ)
is the dimensionless laser intensity envelope averaged
over fast oscillations. Prior to the arrival of the laser
the normalized wakeﬁeld E ≡ eEk/mecωp = −dx/dζ
is zero. A formal solution for the electric ﬁeld out-
side the laser can be written as the ﬁrst integral of (1):
−∞ a2x′/x2dζ, which reaches

a maximum value at x = 1:

[E out(ζ)]2 = −(x − 1)2/x+R ∞
max]2 = −Z ∞

x(cid:17)dζ.

(2)

This expression can be understood in terms of the de-
position of laser energy into plasma. Due to negligible
scattering, the photon number in the laser is essentially
constant, and the laser energy loss is predominantly in
the form of frequency redshift, or photon deceleration

The energy density in the wake from (2) can then be
interpreted as the intensity-weighted integral of the pho-
ton deceleration throughout the pulse. Let’s denote the
wake-dependent part of the photon deceleration function

as κ(ζ) ≡ x′/x2. It is closely related to the character-
istic laser depletion length ld, or the distance in which
the maximally decelerated laser slice redshifts down to
ωp assuming a nonevolving wakeﬁeld. From (3), ld =
[(ω0/ωp)2 − 1]/kpκmax, where κmax is the maximum of
κ(ζ) inside the laser. The value of the peak wakeﬁeld in
(2) is bounded from above by the total laser energy and
the maximum photon deceleration:

the smallest depletion length among all pulses of ﬁxed
energy. For circularly polarized pulses with cylindrical
transverse crossection of radius r0 and wavelength λ, the
maximum achievable wake is then given by:

(4)

One possible optimization problem can then be formu-
lated as follows: given some ﬁxed laser energy ε0 (i.e.,
the integral of a2), and the desired depletion length (i.e.,
κmax = κ0), what laser shape would produce the largest
possible wakeﬁeld? From (4) it is clear that such a shape
should maintain a constant maximal photon deceleration
throughout the pulse. If the laser is present for ζ > 0,
then in order to satisfy the boundary conditions the pho-
ton deceleration should rise from 0 to value κ0 at the
very beginning of the pulse, e.g., like a step-function:
κ(ζ) = κ0θ(ζ+). Here, ζ+ ≡ ζ − 0+ in order to avoid
ambiguities with the values of step-function at 0. The
corresponding laser proﬁle is then found from the wake
equation (1):

such that R ζ>0

where ζ ∈ [0, ζf < 1/κ0], and δ(ζ+) is a delta-function
δ(y+)dy = 1. A schematic drawing of
the optimal laser intensity variation and its associated
plasma wakeﬁeld are shown in Fig. 1. Generally, the
shape consists of a δ-function at the front followed by a
ramp in intensity which is cut oﬀ at ζf .
In the linear
regime, when a2 ≪ 1, κ0 → 0, the ramp reduces to a tri-
angular shape found in [9,10]: a2 = 2κ0(δ(ζ+) + ζ). We
note that (5) describes a family of shapes, rather than
a ﬁxed shape. The actual proﬁle of the optimal pulse
depends on the deceleration parameter κ0 set by the de-
sired depletion length and the pulse length ζf , which is
determined from the available total energy:

ε0 = 2κ0 +

ζf [κ2

0 + (1 − κ0ζf )3]
(1 − κ0ζf )4

.

(6)

Although the pulse length cannot exceed ζc ≡ 1/κ0, the
rise of a2 towards the end of the pulse guarantees that
any ﬁnite laser energy can be accommodated for ζf < ζc.
The two terms in (6) represent the energy contained in
the δ-function precursor and the main pulse. It is clear
that for a ﬁxed total energy there exists a maximum value
of κ0 = ε0/2 which is achieved when ζf → 0, i.e., all
of the energy is concentrated in the δ-function. This
shape, which is a particular case of the general optimal
shape (5), excites the largest possible wakeﬁeld and has

FIG. 1. General shape of the nonlinear optimal laser inten-
sity proﬁle and its corresponding wakeﬁeld (arbitrary units).

The method used for obtaining the optimal shape (5)
is actually more general and can be used to determine
laser shapes that generate other variations in the nonlin-
ear index of refraction. Having a physical requirement
for the refractive index η ≡ [1 − (ωp/ω)2ne/γnp]1/2 =
[1 − (ωp/ω)21/x]1/2, which for this case is the require-
ment of uniformity of photon deceleration, provides a
constraint on x(ζ), which can then be used to ﬁnd the
laser shape from the wake equation. Alas, such a “re-
verse” solution is not always guaranteed to yield a physi-
cal (i.e., positive) a2(ζ), so, in general, caution is advised.

While the generation of large accelerating gradients is
a prerequisite for a successful accelerating scheme, the ef-
ﬁciency of acceleration should also be considered. For an
accelerating scheme that involves transfer of energy from
the driver beam to the accelerating beam, eﬃciency is
measured in terms of the transformer ratio, or the ra-
tio of the maximum rate of energy gain per particle of
accelerating beam to the maximum rate of energy loss
per particle of the driving beam.
In the case of laser-
plasma accelerators, where the driving and accelerating
beams consist of particles of diﬀerent species, the follow-
ing kinematic deﬁnition is more useful:

R ≡

|∂γa/∂z|max
|∂γd/∂z|max

,

(8)

where γd and γa are Lorentz factors for the driving and
accelerating beams. In LWFA the particles in the trailing

electron bunch are accelerated via electrostatic interac-
tion with the wake, so |∂γa/∂z|max = |eEmax
|/mec2 =
kp|E out
max|. For the laser propagating in plasma γd ≈ ω/ωp,
so |∂γd/∂z| is the photon frequency shift given by (3).
The transformer ratio for LWFA is then:

k

RLWFA =

2ω
ωp

|∂x/∂ζ|out
max
|∂(1/x)/∂ζ|in

max

∝ |E|out

maxkpld.

(9)

It follows from this deﬁnition that the transformer ratio
is not only a measure of local accelerating eﬃciency, but
is also directly related to the maximum energy that can
be transferred to the accelerating beam particle over the
laser depletion length (assuming no evolution of the wake
during propagation).

As there is no absolute maximum of R, we can only
look for a shape that maximizes R subject to constraints.
For instance, among the pulses of ﬁxed energy and deple-
tion length R is maximized by a pulse that produces the
largest wakeﬁeld. But this is precisely the optimal shape
found above. A more general proof involves considering
all pulses irrespective of total energy that create a given
value of wakeﬁeld. It can then be shown [11] that a pulse
which has the largest depletion length among these must
maintain a constant photon deceleration inside the pulse,
which again points to the shape (5). From (9) the opti-
mal transformer ratio is then:

RLWFA =

2ω

ωps 1 + (kpLp)2[1 − κ0(kpLp)]3

[1 − κ0(kpLp)]4

,

(10)

In the linear
where Lp = ζf /kp is the pulse length.
regime optimal transformer ratios for both LWFA and
PWFA schemes scale identically with the pulse/beam

length: RLWFA → (2ω/ωp)p1 + (kpLpulse)2, RPWFA →
p1 + (kpLbeam)2 [12]. The LWFA scheme is intrinsically

more eﬃcient by a factor of 2ω/ωp, which is needed for vi-
ability of LWFA since lasers are typically “slower” drivers
than electron beams.

The advantage of using the optimal pulse shape is best
seen in comparison with the unshaped (Gaussian) pulse.
For a given Gaussian pulse (or any other non-optimal
shape) one can always construct a corresponding opti-
mally shaped pulse with the same laser energy such that
the photon deceleration across the optimal pulse equals
to the peak photon deceleration in the unshaped one (i.e.,
both pulses have equal depletion lengths). Unshaped
pulses deplete ﬁrst in the region where photon decelera-
tion is the largest, whereas a laser with the optimal shape
loses all its energy in a depletion length due to uniform
photon deceleration, thus enhancing instantaneous en-
ergy deposition and wakeﬁeld. For a numerical example,
we consider the optimal and Gaussian pulses of total en-
ergy 0.5J, wavelength 1µm and cylindrical radius 10µm
in a plasma with np = 1018cm−3. The transformer ra-
tio, the maximum wakeﬁeld, the required pulse length,

and the corresponding peak a0 are shown in Fig. 2 as
functions of depletion length.

From Fig. 2 we see that the transformer ratio and the
maximum wakeﬁeld are consistently larger for shaped
pulses.
In fact, the lines for optimal pulse wakeﬁeld
and transformer ratio represent theoretical upper lim-
its for all pulses of given energy. The Gaussian pulse
achieves a maximum transformer ratio when its length
(measured here as FWHM) equals 1/2 of the relativis-
tic plasma wavelength. The eﬀects of shaping are espe-
cially prominent for longer pulses, where Gaussian pulse
yields almost no wake excitation due to plasma oscilla-
tions inside the pulse that cause part of the laser photons
to absorb energy from the wake. On the other hand, a
shaped laser postpones plasma oscillation until the end of
the pulse, and all photons decelerate uniformly. For very
short pulses, the diﬀerences between the two shapes are
minimal. This is due to the fact that very short Gaus-
sian pulses of ﬁxed energy asymptotically approach the
delta-function limit of the short optimal shape.

FIG. 2. Comparison of the transformer ratio, maximum
wakeﬁeld, pulse length, and maximum normalized vector po-
tential in shaped (diamonds) and Gaussian (triangles) pulses
of equal depletion lengths and constant pulse energy of 0.5J.

Although short pulses generally produce the largest
wakeﬁelds, their eﬃciency is close to minimal possible,
as the depletion length decreases faster than increase in
the wake. Therefore, the choice of the appropriate pulse
shape for LWFA stage will depend on speciﬁc experimen-
tal conditions. If the laser-plasma interaction distance is
limited by instabilities, diﬀraction or dephasing, then in
order to maximize the electron energy gain one should
try to achieve the largest accelerating gradient, which
can be accomplished with ultrashort pulses.
If, how-

3

ever, the interaction length is less constrained, such as
the case for propagation in plasma channels [13], then
using a ﬁnite-length shaped pulse will result in a greatly
improved overall energy gain per stage. An added ben-
eﬁt of pulse shaping is the suppression of modulational
instability that aﬀects unshaped pulses that are longer
than plasma wavelength. When all photons redshift, or
“slow down”, at the same rate, diﬀerent laser slices do
not overrun each other, and the 1D laser self-modulation
is suppressed.

As the optimal pulse shape is associated with a delta-
function precursor, the feasibility of such a structure may
be a concern. We note that the purpose of this precursor
is to bring the photon deceleration from zero in the qui-
escent plasma before the laser to a ﬁnite value κ0 at the
beginning of the main pulse. This can also be achieved
with a more physical prepulse, whose shape can be found
once a smooth function κ(ζ) is chosen. For our example
we choose κ(ζ) = κ0[1 + tanh α(ζ − ζ0)]/2, where α is a
steepness parameter and ζ0 is an arbitrary oﬀset. The
corresponding laser shape is then:

with longer rise times of κ(ζ). It is also possible to con-
struct optimal shapes that propagate in a pre-existing
plasma oscillation and act as wakeﬁeld ampliﬁers [11].
Such shapes also do not require delta-function precur-
sors.

Several issues should be addressed before the laser
pulse shaping concept can be fully utilized. Even without
the delta-function precursor, the ﬁnite laser bandwidth
will necessarily smooth out sharp rises and falls of the
optimal pulse shape. Although we do not anticipate ad-
verse eﬀects when the feature size is much smaller than
the plasma wavelength, the 1D self-consistent laser evo-
lution and stability of realistic optimal shapes are cur-
rently under investigation. Another consideration is the
inﬂuence of the laser-plasma interaction in the trans-
verse dimension on the evolution of the pulse. Many of
the laser-plasma instabilities are seeded by the wakeﬁeld-
induced perturbations of the index of refraction. As we
have demonstrated in this Letter, the nonlinear index
of refraction can be eﬀectively controlled through laser
shaping, thus suggesting the method of delaying the on-
set of these instabilities. Whether this approach increases
the growth rates of other instabilities, particularly in the
transverse dimension, remains to be investigated.

of α the delta-function precursor spreads out and can
even disappear as shown in Fig. 3. The family of shapes
given by (11) is better suited for the ﬁnite-bandwidth
laser systems that have a lower limit on achievable fea-
ture size. The values of the maximum wakeﬁeld for pulses
in Fig. 3 are within few percent of the value for an equiv-
alent delta-function optimal pulse because the bulk of
the modiﬁed laser pulse still experiences constant maxi-
mal photon deceleration. The wakeﬁeld further degrades

Abstract

In the framework of the pseudophotons method and under the
hypothesis of the far ﬁeld approximation the formal evaluation of
the transition radiation spectrum produced by a three-dimensional
charged beam interacting with a metallic target is carried out. When
spatial incoherent conditions are occurring, the transverse size of a
three-dimensional beam aﬀects the spectrum via a suitable depen-
dence on the Fourier transform of the transverse distribution, while
the temporal coherent enhance of the spectrum depends only on the
longitudinal beam size via the longitudinal form factor in the same
manner as in the case of a one-dimensional beam. Spatial incoherent
eﬀects, arising at short wave-length in the spectrum, on the one hand
allow a better comprehension of some aspects of the transition radi-
ation phenomelogy - e.g. an analytical formula for the total radiated
energy - and on the other hand oﬀer new perspectives in the practical
application of the transition radiation as diagnostics method of the
transverse beam size in a particle accelerator.

1 Introduction

Transition radiation theory describes those radiative phenomena produced
by high energy charged particles crossing the interface between two media

with diﬀerent dielectric properties. Typical transition radiation events are
represented by relativistic charged particles crossing in the vacuum a thin

metallic layer. As natural extension, such a category of events also includes
the diﬀraction radiation phenomena, i.e., the radiative mechanisms observed

when a charged beam passes through a circular or rectangular slit over a
metallic screen.

In the past few years the transition radiation theory, based on the sin-
gle particle formalism describing a point-like charge colliding with an ideal
metallic target of inﬁnite size [1, 2, 3, 4], attracted much interest in those

aspects concerning the diﬀractive modiﬁcations aﬀecting such formalism as
the ﬁnite size of the screen is considered [5, 6, 7, 8]. The aim of the present

paper is to contribute to an extension of the transition radiation theory by
including in the formalism the source size eﬀects arising as the charged beam
can be realistically described by a three-dimensional probability distribution.
The pseudophotons method , describing the transition radiation produced
by a high energy beam as a radiation ﬁeld scattered oﬀ a metallic screen, is
a powerful formalism [1, 9] allowing to calculate the diﬀractive modiﬁcations
in the spectrum due to the ﬁnite size of the metallic target and/or to the

presence of a slit on it. In the framework of such a formalism and supposing
- as reasonable in practical situations - the linear size of the detector sur-

face much smaller than the distance between the scattering surface and the
detector itself (far ﬁeld approximation), the complete formal expression of
the transition radiation spectrum produced by a three-dimensional electron
bunch colliding with a metallic target is obtained in this paper. As diﬀerent
from the classical articles [10, 11, 12], which are dedicated to the collective

eﬀects observable at long wave-length in the synchrotron radiation spectrum
emitted by one-dimensional electron beam with zero transverse dimension

moving on a circular orbit, the present paper treats transition radiative phe-
nomena concerning three-dimensional charged beam and, consequently, de-

2

rives physical consequences.

2 Transition radiation spectrum produced by
a three-dimensional charged beam in the
framework of the pseudophotons method

It has been shown [11, 12] that the synchrotron radiation spectrum emitted by

N electrons, collected in a longitudinally extended bunch with zero transverse
dimension moving on a circular orbit, is described by the following expression

dI(ω)
dω

=

dIe(ω)
dω

[N + N(N

1)F (ω)],

−

(1)

dω

where dIe(ω)
- the intensity per frequency unit - is related to the radiative
mechanism produced by the single electron in the bunch (single particle spec-
trum). The longitudinal form factor F (ω) can be stated - in the limit of a
continuous charge distribution - as the squared module of the Fourier trans-
form of the longitudinal probability distribution function ρz(z):

F (ω) =

dz ρz(z)ei(ωz/c)

.

(2)

Due to its relativistic origin, Eq.(1) continues to maintain its validity for

one-dimensional beams if, instead of considering the synchrotron radiative
mechanism, we consider the transition one. Then, we assume that the N

electrons - collected in a three-dimensional bunch and in linear uniform mo-
tion with common velocity ~w - hit normally a ﬂat metallic screen producing

forward and backward transition radiation. Whether the procedure of sub-
stituting in (1) the longitudinal form factor (2) with a three-dimensional
one

F (~k) =

d~r ρ(~r)ei~k·~r

(3)

is the correct one when the charged beam is described by a three-dimensional

continuous probability distribution function ρ(~r), represents the subject of
the following part of this paper.

The frequency distribution of the transition radiation intensity can be
obtained describing the radiative mechanism in terms of the pseudophotons
method [1, 9], which allows to directly include in the calculations also screen
size eﬀects. According to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, the transition radi-
ation ﬁeld can be therefore imagined as the diﬀractive propagation of a pseu-
dophotons ﬁeld scattered oﬀ the metallic screen. In practice the harmonic
components of the transition radiation ﬁeld, meant as scattered components
of the transverse electromagnetic (e.m.) ﬁeld moving with the charge, can
be analytically expressed via the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ
[13]. Such integrals, under the assumption of the far ﬁeld approximation, can
be simply calculated [1, 14] by Fourier transforming the pseudophotons ﬁeld
components with respect to the coordinates (x, y) of the metallic target sur-
face S. Therefore, at large distance R from the target the transition radiation
electric ﬁeld components (Etr

components (Eps

2.1 Charge electromagnetic ﬁeld as pseudophotons ﬁeld

Before expressing the pseudophotons ﬁeld ( ~Eps) in terms of the the e.m.
ﬁeld ( ~Ech) travelling with the electron bunch, it is better to make clear the
scenario.

It is assumed that a charged beam, moving along the z axis with constant
velocity ~w = (0, 0, w), hits a ﬂat surface S, made of an ideal conductor
(dielectric constant ǫcond =
) and lying on the (x, y, z = 0) plane of the
reference frame. A non-dispersive medium with permeability µ = 1 and
characteristic phase velocity v = c/√ǫ surrounds the surface. Furthermore it
is assumed that N electrons, forming a three-dimensional bunch at rest with

∞

4

respect to the center-of-mass frame, are described by a distribution function
ρ(~r) “frozen” in time:

ρ(~r, t) = ρ(~r, 0) =

(5)

Z
This assumption, in accordance with the observation that the radiative pro-

cess at a given time only depends on those electrons in the bunch hitting
at the same time the metallic screen, corresponds to treat the N electrons

as uncorrelated and described by a probability distribution function and a
corresponding Fourier transform expressed as: ρ(~r) = ρx(x)ρy(y)ρz(z) and
ρ(~k) = ρx(kx)ρy(ky)ρz(kz) respectively.

It can be demonstrated that the Fourier transform of the electric ﬁeld

moving with the charge is

the charge velocity ~w.

Therefore, the harmonic components of the transverse electric ﬁeld trav-

eling with the charge follows from Eq.(6):

S, while ~κ = (κx, κy) and ~τ = (kx, ky) indicate the transverse components
of the wave-vectors corresponding to the pseudophotons and the transition
radiation ﬁelds respectively.

As evident from the diﬀerent role played in (10) by the Fourier transform
of the transverse distribution functions ρu(ku) (u = x, y) with respect to the
longitudinal one ρz(kz), the three-dimensional generalization of Eq.(1) by
substituting the longitudinal form factor with a three-dimensional one such
as in Eq.(3) appears to be incorrect. It is also obvious to notice that Eq.(10)
reduces to the well known single particle transition radiation ﬁeld [1] when
N = 1 and ρu(ku) = 1 (u = x, y, z).

2.3 Transition radiation spectrum: from the discrete
three-dimensional distribution to the continuous
limit

In practical situations, as those occurring in an accelerator machine, the
number of the electrons composing a bunch is so large that it can be rea-
sonably described by means of a continuous probability distribution function
(continuous density limit). Therefore, in order to derive the expression of the
actually detected transition radiation spectrum, an average procedure has to

be carried out:

d2I
dΩdω

=

d2Idis
dΩdω +ens

*

where in the second term of the previous statement the energy radiated - per
solid angle and frequency units - by a particular discrete charge distribution

is averaged over the ensemble of the inﬁnite series of the equivalent discrete
particle conﬁgurations [12].

Supposing N electrons moving with a common uniform velocity ~w, the

allows also to outline that spatial coherent eﬀects are expected to be observed

in the spectrum, when the beam can be considered - with respect to the

In addition temporal coherent eﬀects are expected to arise in the
spectrum when the wave-length is so long that the slices sequence has to

be considered as a continuous charge distribution also in the longitudinal
direction.

As more extensively described in the Appendix, the complete formal ex-

vacuum - can be expressed as

under the hypothesis of the far ﬁeld approximation and F (ω) is the longitu-
dinal form factor [Eq.(2)].

Some comments about the last statements. (1) When temporal coher-
ent conditions are occurring, the transition radiation spectrum in the three-
dimensional case shows the same dependence on the longitudinal form factor
[Eq.(2)] as in the one-dimensional case [Eq.(1)]. (2) The results stated by

Eqs.(15, 16) are consistent with the ones valid for one-dimensional charged
beam when ρx(κx) = ρy(κy) = 1 or when the observed wave-length is longer
than the transverse size of the beam.
(3) Conversely, when the observed
wave-length is shorter than the transverse size of the beam, source size eﬀects
appear evident in the spectrum via a dependence on the Fourier transforms
of the transverse distribution of the beam (ρu(κu), u = x, y). Therefore,
both the measurements of the energy and of the transverse size of the beam

are not independent each other when the spectrum shows spatial incoherent
characteristics.

3 Gaussian beam colliding with an inﬁnitely

extended metallic screen

In the ideal and handy case of a three-dimensional gaussian beam normally
hitting a metallic screen S of inﬁnite size, the analytical expression for the

transition radiation spectrum can be derived from Eqs.(16):

It is easy to check that for a point-like charge (ρx(kx) = ρy(ky) = 1) Eq.(17)
reduces to the well known frequency independent single particle spectrum

The shift of the polar angle distribution of the transition radiation inten-

that beam energy measurements, based on the analysis of the angular dis-
tribution of the spectrum, can be - depending on the observed wave-length

- strongly aﬀected by the beam transverse size at the low energy regime. In
fact, according to the single particle theory, the angular position θmax of the

4 Source size dependence of the spectrum and

main experimental consequences

From Eqs.(17, 19) it can be observed that the spectral angular distribution
carries information about the transverse beam size. Then, as far as the

arguments treated in this paper can be considered valid, the analysis of the
angular distribution of the transition radiation intensity oﬀers information

not only about the beam energy, but also about the beam size. From such a
circumstance several consequences concerning beam diagnostics applications
of the transition radiation and deeper understanding of its phenomelogy can

be drawn.

First of all the beam energy measurement based on the usual single par-
ticle analysis of the angular distribution of the transition radiation in the
optical region can be aﬀected by a systematic error as larger as longer is the

transverse beam size with respect to the observed wave-length. Moreover,
such a dependence of the spectrum on the Fourier transform of the trans-

verse charge distribution oﬀers interesting and suggestive opportunities in
the ﬁeld of the beam diagnostic applications of the transition radiation. In

10

fact, although the technique to measure the transverse size of the beam by
analyzing the angular distribution of the intensity oﬀers a poor appealing as

beam diagnostic tool in the optical region (OTR, [16, 17, 18]), nevertheless
it appears to be promising in the infrared-micrometer analysis [19, 20, 21]

of those transition radiation spectra produced by intense and high energy
charged beams passing through a hole in a metallic screen, which are prop-

erly referred as diﬀraction radiation phenomena [1].

Related to the understanding of the phenomelogy, it is to be noticed
that, according to Eq.(17), the spectral angular distribution decreases to

zero when the frequency tends to inﬁnity, and that such a behaviour is in
agreement with the high frequency features of the experimentally observed

transition radiation spectra [4, 9]. Moreover, it is to be stressed that such
agreement - in this context necessarily qualitative - with the experimental

results does not follow from any assumption on the frequency dependence
of the dielectric constant of the metallic screen. Conversely it is well known

that, in order to explain such a feature in the measured transition radiation
spectra, it is necessary to dismiss in the high frequency regime the hypothesis
of considering ideal conductor properties for the metallic screen (dielectric
constant ǫcond =
(ǫcond ≈
according to:

) and to take into account the real dielectric properties

(22)

Furthermore, other and more qualiﬁed conﬁrmations to the present approach
to the transition radiation theory for real electron beams follow from a com-

parison with some other well-known features of the experimental spectra. In
fact, it is possible to derive the analytical expression for the total energy

emitted during the radiative mechanism by integrating Eq.(20) with respect
to the polar angle θ and the wave-number k. For such a purpose the trans-
verse size of the beam is assumed so large that the ideal conductor hypothesis
(ǫcond =
) can be considered valid in that part of the frequency band ef-
fectively of interest in the integration. Moreover, assuming for simplicity a
gaussian cylindrical symmetry (σx = σy = σ) for an electron beam with en-
ergy E, the total - “forward” and “backward” - energy emitted during the

11

collision can be expressed as:

W tr =

√π(eβ)2
2σ

mc2 .

(23)

In the range of validity of the just referred hypothesis and without introduc-
ing any frequency cut-oﬀ, the analytical formula expressed by Eq.(23) allows

a plain explanation of the experimental main features observed in the emitted
transition radiation energy in both the low and the high beam energy limits.

The previous statement is a particular case of the most general expression
valid for an asymmetric gaussian distribution (σx 6

where F (α, β; γ; z) is the Hypergeometric function [15].

As comment to the last result, it should be noticed that, approaching
the beam axis over the boundary surface, the pseudophotons ﬁeld [Eq.(9)]
diverges to inﬁnity in the case of a single particle, while it maintains a ﬁnite
value in the case of a three-dimensional charge distribution, as expected for

the electric ﬁeld inside the core of a spatially extended charge distribution. In
fact, using spherical coordinates and referring the polar angle θ to the z axis
normal to the target surface lying on the (x, y) plane, it can be demonstrated
that, for a gaussian beam with a cylindrical symmetry, the pseudophotons

5 Conclusions

In the framework of the pseudophotons method and under the hypothesis
of the far ﬁeld approximation it has been demonstrated that, in the case

12

of a three-dimensional charged beam colliding with a metallic target, the
temporal coherent part of the spectrum depends on the longitudinal form
factor in the same manner as in the one-dimensional case. It has been also
demonstrated that the transverse beam size aﬀects the spectrum via the

Fourier transform of the transverse charge distribution and that the spectrum
becomes insensitive to it - reducing to the well known single particle spectrum
- when the observed wave-length is larger than the transverse beam size. As
reasonable to expect, the single particle spectrum can be interpreted as the
spatial coherent limit of the transition radiation spectrum corresponding to

a three-dimensional beam. The demonstrated evidence in the spectrum of
the spatial incoherent eﬀects due to the transverse size of the beam - on the

one hand - allows a better comprehension of some aspects of the transition
radiation phenomenology - on the other hand - oﬀers new perspectives in the

use of the transition radiation as beam diagnostic tool.

In fact, as the transverse size of the beam is increasing, the high frequency

damping feature observed in the experimental transition radiation spectra
should depend more on the source size eﬀects than on the frequency depen-
dence of the dielectric constant of the metallic screen. Moreover, supposing

as dominant such a mechanism, it is also possible to derive an analytical
formula for the total radiated energy showing an unexpected dependence on

the reciprocal of the transverse beam size besides the expected one on both
the square of the charge velocity and energy.

From the point of view of the beam diagnostic implications, the depen-
dence on transverse form factor appears to be an useful tool to derive in-
formation about the transverse beam size from the analysis of the spectral

angular distribution, even observing the radiation in conditions of tempo-
ral incoherence and in non-optical wave-length regions, when the radiative

mechanism is produced in a non-destructive way by a charged beam pass-
ing through a slit in a metallic target (diﬀraction radiation). In fact from

Eqs.(20), supposing as known the beam energy, it appears in principle pos-
sible to measure the beam size by observing the radiation in conditions of

spatial incoherence, i.e., by selecting - by means of a monochromator - from
the spectrum a wave-length much shorter than the transverse size itself and

13

by analyzing the corresponding angular distribution.

A Appendix

The formal expression of the transition radiation spectrum produced by a
three-dimensional charged beam [Eqs.(15, 16)] is obtained supposing as in-

ﬁnite the number of the electrons composing the bunch. According to the
continuous density limit [12] one can assume: (1) The ensemble average of
Eq.(11) does not depend on N. (2) All the sum operations over N can be
extended to inﬁnity and, thus, substituted with integral operations, while
the charge discrete spatial distribution [Eq.(13)] can be identiﬁed with the

corresponding mean continuous probability distribution function [Eq.(5)].

INTRODUCTION

Losses of energy by particles in external ﬁelds caused
by friction forces lead to a decrease of the six-dimensional
phase space (emittance) occupied by the particle beam
and damping of betatron and synchrotron oscillations of
particles in storage rings. Special insertion devices can
be used to introduce friction forces for decreasing the
emittances of stored beams (to cool beams) and pro-
duce high quality particle beams. Friction forces can
be caused by: 1) radiation reaction in static external
ﬁelds, 2) radiation reaction in time dependent external
ﬁelds (backward Compton and Rayleigh scattering of
laser light), 3) ionization and radiation processes in ma-
terial targets located in the vacuum chamber of the ring.
They can lead both to damping or build-up of amplitudes
of betatron and synchrotron oscillations of particles. The
physics of damping in the longitudinal plane is diﬀerent
from that in the transverse one.

Usually a particle with a higher than ideal energy loses
more energy than the ideal particle and a particle with
lower energy loses less energy. The combined eﬀect is
that the energy diﬀerence between non-ideal and ideal
particles is reduced. A decrease of the particle energy
deviation from the ideal leads to a decrease of its conju-
gate variable, the longitudinal phase deviation from the
synchronous phase, i.e., to cooling in the longitudinal
phase space.

In the transverse plane, the loss of particle energy leads
to a loss of its longitudinal as well as transverse momen-
tum, since the particle performs betatron oscillations.
The total momentum loss is, however, replaced in the
cavity only in the longitudinal direction. The combined
eﬀect of the energy loss and the replacement of the en-
ergy loss in accelerating cavities leads to a net loss of
transverse momentum, or transverse damping. The total
amount of damping in all degrees of freedom is limited
by the amount of the energy loss.

There is a correlation of damping decrements in all
degrees of freedom determined by Robinson’s damping
criterion [1]. This criterion limits the rate of particle
cooling in storage rings. Here, we would like to pay at-
tention to the limits of applicability of this criterion, its
violation in some schemes of selective interaction of par-
ticle beams with material and laser targets. New schemes
of enhanced cooling of ion, electron and muon beams will

be discussed. Two schemes of enhanced cooling will be
developed in details.

We start by reviewing Robinson’s damping criterion.

LIMITS OF APPLICABILITY OF THE

ROBINSON’S DAMPING CRITERION

The general method of describing the motion of a par-
ticle in circular accelerators and storage rings is to de-
termine the ideal orbit, and then analyze small devia-
tions from this orbit in transverse radial x, vertical y
and longitudinal ϕ planes of a curvilinear coordinate sys-
tem (x, y, ϕ), where ϕ is the phase deviation from the
synchronous one. In a linear approximation components
(x,y,ϕ) are described by linear, homogeneous, second or-
der diﬀerential equations of the form

u′′ + v(s)u′ + w(s)u = 0

(1)

where s is the longitudinal coordinate of a particle along
the ideal (reference) orbit and u′, u” are derivatives
[2],[3],[4]. We can introduce a six-dimensional coordinate
vector ~u with components (x, x′, y, y′, ϕ, ∆ε) and write
three second-order equations (1) in the form of a sys-
tem of six linear, ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations. In the
matrix presentation, this system has the form

The expression (4) can be applied to ionization muon
cooling [6] and radiative ion cooling [7] based on their
laws of particle energy loss in the material media and
laser beams 1. They diﬀer from the synchrotron radiation
loss law. The form of this equation does not depend on
the type of lattice of the storage ring and is determined
by the average power and the partial derivative of the
average power with respect to the energy.

If there is no coupling between radial x and vertical
y planes in a storage ring, the same calculations can be
performed separately for vertical oscillations using the
second order matrix and Wronskian.
In this case, the

Below, we deal with the conditions used in the proof
of this criterion. 1) The reference energy and the am-
plitude of the RF accelerating voltage are constants. 2)
The voltage is not equal to zero. 3) The average power of
the particle energy loss is linearly dependent on the par-
ticle energy deviation ∆ε from synchronous (reference)
energy in the storage ring (the ﬁrst linear term in the
expansion P (∆ε) was used). The equations of motion
in our case are the linear homogeneous Hill’s equations
for the transverse degrees of freedom and the pendulum
equation for the longitudinal one when we neglect cou-
pling and losses. The losses lead to additional terms at
the ﬁrst order derivatives in the corresponding equations.

Linear dependence P on ∆ε and stationary conditions
are important for the exponential decay and the concept
of decrement. The violation of the conditions 1 - 3 can
lead to the violation of the damping criterion. Particular
examples conﬁrm this assumption.

Example 1. Cooling of ion beams in the longitudinal
plane. An ion beam interacts with a broadband laser
beam in a straight section of a storage ring with zero
dispersion function. There is no coupling between radial
x, vertical y and longitudinal ϕ planes. The laser beam
is homogeneous in the limits of the ion-laser beam inter-
action region (IR) and has sharp frequency edges. The
frequency band of the laser beam is suﬃcient for all ions

to interact with the laser beam. The RF system of the
storage ring is switched oﬀ. The minimum initial en-
ergy of ions corresponds to interaction with photons of
high-frequency edge of the laser beam through Rayleigh
scattering.

In this example, we introduced the following violations
of conditions used in the proof of the Robinson damping
criterion: 1) The RF acceleration voltage is switched oﬀ,
2) The nonlinear (step) dependence of the rate of energy
loss with respect to ion energy is introduced: ions with
energy more than the minimum initial energy interact
with the laser beam and ions with less energy do not.

If the power of scattered radiation is P and the energy
spread of the ion beam, 2σε, the longitudinal damping

The damping time (8) is much less then (9) and con-

tradicts to Robinson’s damping criterion.

Example 2. Cooling of ion beams in the longitudinal
plane. An ion beam interacts with a broadband laser
beam in a straight section of a storage ring with zero
dispersion function. There is no coupling between radial
x, vertical y and longitudinal ϕ planes. The laser beam
is homogeneous in the limits of the ion beam and has
sharp frequency edges. The frequency band of the laser
beam is suﬃcient for all ions to interact with the laser
beam. The RF system of the storage ring is switched
on. The synchronous energy of ions corresponds to inter-
action with photons of high-frequency edge of the laser
beam through Rayleigh scattering. The spectral inten-
sity of the laser beam is linearly increased from zero at
the minimum frequency to maximum at the maximum
frequency.

In this example we introduced the following violations
of conditions used in the proof of this criterion: 1) A
discontinuity of the dependence of the rate of energy loss
with respect to the ion energy:
ions with energy more
than the synchronous energy interact with the laser beam
and ions with less energy do not.

The power of the scattered radiation depends on the
ion energy according to the law: P =< Pmax >
εs)/σε,0] at εs < ε < εs + σε and P = 0 at ε < εs,
[(ε
where P max = P (ε
εs = σε,0) is determined by the in-
tensity of the laser beam. In this case, a synchronous ion
does not lose energy. There is no friction and damping of
synchrotron oscillations at the energy ε < εs and there
is damping at the energy ε > εs. The nature of damping
at ε > εs is identical to synchrotron radiation damping.
It is determined by the derivative of the rate of ion en-
ergy loss ∂P /∂ε
P max/σε, which can be much greater
than the value ∂P /∂ε = P /εs(1 + D) for radiative ion
cooling. The damping time in this example will be only
two times less than in Example 1 if the maximum rate of
energy loss P max is equal to the rate of energy loss P in
Example 1.

Note that fast cooling in these schemes is possible be-
cause we cool the ion beam in a thin layer in the longitu-
dinal phase space when the minimum energy of the ion
εs, the advantage
beam stays constant. In the case 2σε ≈
of fast cooling disappears.

We can expect that other schemes of fast cooling ap-
plicable for cooling of ion, electron and muon beams in
transverse and longitudinal planes can be found.

III. ENHANCED COOLING SCHEMES

In this paper two methods of enhanced cooling of par-
ticle beams in the longitudinal and transverse planes are
considered when selective interaction of particles with
special targets is used. The targets (material, laser, un-
dulator) are installed in the vacuum chamber of the stor-
age ring and can be displaced in the radial direction.
Material targets can be used for muon cooling and laser
targets can be used for ion and electron cooling (laser
beams are propagated in the opposite direction to the
ion or electron beams and displaced in the radial direc-
tion)2. The IR in this case changes its radial position
in the particle beam during the cooling process. Broad-
band laser beams have to be used for ion cooling in order
for all ions, independent of their energy, to interact with
laser beams. Ampliﬁcation of the broadband laser beam
power in the IR of laser and ion beams can be achieved
by means of a high-ﬁnesse optical resonator [9].

Below we will neglect the emission of synchrotron ra-
diation by particles in the bending magnets of a storage
ring, assuming the RF system of the ring is switched oﬀ
and targets are homogeneous and have sharp edges in the
radial directions. We assume the jump of closed orbits
of particles caused by their energy loss in the target is
less than the amplitude of betatron oscillations of these
particles.

−

In a smooth approximation, the motion of a particle
relative to the position xη of its closed orbit is described
by the equation xβ = A cos ϕ, where xβ = x
xη is the
particle deviation from the orbit; x, its radial coordinate;
ϕ = Ωt + ϕ0, phase of the particle; ϕ0, the initial phase;
A and Ω = 2πνxf , the amplitude and the frequency of
betatron oscillations, respectively; νx, the tune of beta-
tron oscillations; f , the particle revolution frequency [3].
If the coordinate xβ 0 and transverse radial velocity of
AΩ sin ϕ correspond to the moment
the particle ˙xβ 0 =
t0 of change of the particle energy in a target, then the

reality, closed orbits can be moved in the direction of the target
instead of moving the target. A kick, decreasing of the magnetic

ment or eddy electric ﬁelds can be used for this purpose.

δA =
duce enhanced cooling of a particle beam in the trans-
verse plane, we must create the conditions of selective
interaction when particles interact with a target with de-
viations from the closed orbit xβ0 of the same sign. In
this case the values δA have negative sign if the product
xβ 0δxη > 0. The rate of change of the particle betatron
oscillation amplitude is maximal when

= A.

Two schemes of selective non-resonance interaction of
particles and targets located in straight sections of stor-
age rings with high-dispersion and low-beta function for
cooling of particle beams in the transverse and longi-
tudinal planes accordingly can be proposed. They are
presented in Figures 1 and 2. In these Figures the axis
”z” is the unwrapped reference orbit of the storage ring,
Ll and a are the length and the width of the targets in
the interaction region, respectively. The transverse posi-
tions of targets are displaced with the velocities vT1 and
vT2 relative to the reference orbit. 1,2,3,.. are the particle
trajectories before and after the energy loss in the target.
O1, O2, O3, . . . are the locations of the particle closed
orbit after 0,1,2,3, . . . energy loss events. Parts of one
period of the particle trajectory at the targets T1 and
T2 are shown before and after every event of the particle
energy loss in the targets.

A target T1 can be used for transverse cooling of parti-
cle beams (see Fig. 1). At the initial moment it overlaps
a small internal part of the particle beam in the radial
direction in the straight section of a storage ring with
non-zero dispersion function. The degree of overlapping
of particle beam and target is changed by moving the tar-
get position uniformly with some velocity vT1 from inside
in the direction of the particle beam. First, particles with
largest initial amplitudes of betatron oscillations interact
with the counter-propagating target. Immediately after
the interaction and loss of energy, the position and di-
rection of momentum of a particle remain the same, but
the closed orbit is displaced inward in the direction of
the target [3]. The radial coordinate of the closed orbit
and the amplitude of betatron oscillations are decreased
by the same value owing to the dispersion coupling. Af-
ter every interaction, the position of the closed orbit ap-
proaches the target more and more, and the amplitude
of betatron oscillations is reduced.

The closed orbit moves with a velocity ˙xη, which de-
pends on the particle’s amplitude of betatron oscillation

and the distance between the orbit and the target, since
these values determine the probability of collision of a
particle and a target (see below). It reaches a maximum
velocity
( ˙xη in < 0) if the depth of penetration of
the particle closed orbit in the target is greater than the
amplitude of betatron oscillations of this particle. Af-
ter this, the amplitude of betatron oscillations will stay
constant since the particle will interact with the homo-
geneous target every turn for both positive and negative
deviation from the orbit with equal probability. When
the target reaches the closed orbit corresponding to par-
ticles of maximum energy and the depth of penetration
of the particle closed orbits in the target is greater than
the amplitude of betatron oscillations of these particles,
it must be returned to its previous position. All parti-
cles of the beam will have small amplitudes of betatron
oscillations and increased energy spread.

Particles with high amplitudes of betatron oscillations
start interacting with the target ﬁrst. Their interaction
time is longer and hence the decrease of amplitudes of
betatron oscillations is greater.

A target T2 can be used for longitudinal cooling of
particle beams (see Fig. 2). The radial target position

must be moved uniformly with a velocity

from outside in the direction of the particle beam being
cooled. At the initial moment, the target overlaps only a
small part of the particle beam. The degree of overlap-
ping is changed in such a way that particles of maximum
energy ﬁrst come into interaction and then particles of
lower energy. When the target reaches the orbit of par-
ticles of minimum energy and the depth of penetration
of the particle closed orbits in the target is greater than
the amplitude of betatron oscillations of these particles,
it must be switched oﬀ and returned to the previous posi-
tion. In this case the diﬀerence in duration of interaction
and hence in the energy losses of particles having max-
imum and minimum energies will be large. As a result,
all particles will be gathered at the minimum energy in

and to a much greater degree of heating in the longitudi-
nal one. The degree of heating is

C. Enhanced longitudinal cooling

In the method of enhanced longitudinal cooling of par-
ticle beams by a target T2, the transverse betatron beam
size is increased in accordance with (19). The evolution
of closed orbits of particles interacting with the target
depends on their initial amplitudes of betatron oscilla-
tions. First of all the target interacts with particles hav-
ing the largest initial amplitudes of betatron oscillations
and the highest energies. The position of the closed orbit
of these particles xη1 is changed by law (17) up to the
time t = tf . At the same time closed orbit xη2 of par-
ticles having the same maximum energy but zero ampli-
tudes of betatron oscillations is at rest up to the moment
σx,0/vT2. The orbit xη1 is displaced relative

Broadening of the spreads of closed orbits in a storage

by the ﬁnite spread of amplitudes of betatron oscillations
in a monoenergetic beam of particles. If the beam has
an initial energy spread σε,0, dispersive size ση,0, and the
particles of the beam have no betatron oscillations, its

Resume

In the non-resonance method of enhanced cooling of
particle beams by a targets, according to (19) and (21),
(22), the degree of decrease of amplitudes of betatron
oscillations can be high and the degree of increase of
the spread of closed orbits and the energy spread of the
beam is much greater. In the non-resonance method of
enhanced cooling of particle beams by a target longitu-
dinally, according to (19) and (31), (32) there is a signif-
icant decrease in the spread of closed orbits and energy
spread of particle beams and a considerably lesser in-
crease in amplitudes of betatron oscillations. To produce
enhanced cooling in both planes, we must look for com-
binations of these two enhanced non-resonance methods
of cooling and other methods of fast cooling.

IV. ENHANCED NON-RESONANCE
RADIATIVE ION COOLING

Ions have additional internal selectivity for the inter-
action with laser targets. This selectivity is based on
resonance interaction. It permits more eﬃcient cooling

8

process for ions in comparison with similar process for
other particles. Below we will look back methods based
on conventional and fast cooling and discuss two new
methods based on enhanced cooling.

I. Conventional three-dimensional radiative ion cool-
ing.
In this method a broadband laser beam overlaps
an ion beam, all ions interact with the laser beam in-
dependently of their energy and amplitude of betatron
oscillations. The diﬀerence in rates of momentum loss
of ions having maximum and minimum energies is small
(limited by Robinson’s damping criterion). That is why
the cooling time of the ion beam is long [7], [10]-[15]. If
cooling is produced in a dispersion-free straight section,
the laser beam intensity is constant in the area of the
beam being cooled, the damping times of the horizontal,
vertical, and phase oscillations are:

τx = τy =

τϕ
1 + D

=

2ε
P

,

(34)

where P is the average power of scattered radiation; ε,
the ion energy; D, the saturation parameter [7].

The physics of radiative ion cooling is similar to syn-
chrotron radiation damping. Momentum loss causes the
appearance of a friction or radiative reaction force on
the emitting particle. Liouville’s theorem is not valid
for such nonconservative systems. At the same time, in
case of nonselective interaction, the Robinson’s damping
criterion is valid: the sum of damping decrements is a
constant. With a particular choice of lattice and laser
target, damping rates can be shifted between diﬀerent
degrees of freedom. However the decrements are limited
by the criterion [2, 3, 14, 16].

II. Fast resonance laser cooling of ion beams in the lon-
gitudinal plane. This method is based on the Rayleigh
scattering of ”monochromatic” laser beam photons by
not fully stripped (electronic transitions) or by naked
(nuclear transitions) ion beams when the radio-frequency
(RF) system of the storage ring is switched oﬀ [17]-[24].
In this method the laser beam overlaps the ion beam
and its frequency is scanned.
Ions interact with the
counter-propagating laser beam at resonance energy, de-
crease their energy in the process of the laser frequency
scanning until all of them reach the minimum energy of
ions in the beam. At this frequency the laser beam is
switched oﬀ. The higher the energy of ions, the earlier
they start interacting with the laser beam, the longer
the time of interaction. Ions of minimum energy do not
interact with the laser beam at all. In such a way a se-
lective interaction is realized. In this method the energy
spread is decreased by a linear (nonexponential) law to
a small value limited by quantum processes of Rayleigh
scattering. The damping time of the ion beam in the lon-
gitudinal plane is determined by its standard rms energy
spread σε, 0

τϕ =

2σε, 0
P

.

(35)

103
The nonexponential damping time (35) is ε/σε ∼
times shorter than (34) and the energy spread reduction
is greater if scattered powers P are the same. Then,
the laser power in case (35) is less. The resonance laser
cooling method only works longitudinally and can use
both a dispersion and dispersion-free laser-ion IR.

The transverse decrements in the method of fast res-
onance laser cooling are zero. From this it follows that
the fast damping time (35) is in conﬂict with the Robin-
son damping criterion, but conﬁrmed by getting ultracold
beams [19] - [21]. The violation of the Robinson damp-
ing criterion in processes of the internal kind of selective
interactions is available.

Enhanced laser cooling of ion beams in the
longitudinal and transverse planes

Below an enhanced laser cooling of ion beams both
in transverse and longitudinal planes is considered when
laser beam target T1 moves in the radial direction (see
section 3) and laser beams are propagated in the opposite
direction to the ion beams. The interaction region in this
case changes its radial position in the beam during the
cooling process. Broadband laser beams are used in order
for all ions, independent of their energy, to interact with
laser beams. High-dispersion and low-beta function IR
of storage rings are used.

I. Enhanced transverse laser cooling of ion beams. In
the method a laser target T1 is used. The damping time
and transverse betatron beam size are determined by
(25), (19).

II. Enhanced longitudinal laser cooling of ion beams.
A laser beam has sharp high-frequency edge. The edge
corresponds to the minimum energy of the being cooled
ion beam at the ﬁnish of the transverse cooling when
the beam has the energy spread (23). After ﬁnishing the
transverse cooling the laser beam is stopped and keep the
position for a damping time

τϕ =

2σε,f
P

.

(36)

Meantime ions will be gathered at the minimum energy
and the beam will be cooled in the longitudinal plane.
Then, to a ﬁrst approximation, for a homogenous laser
beam, the transverse dimensions of the ion beam will not
be changed.

III. We can decrease the value of the longitudinal laser
heating, transverse and longitudinal damping times of
the ion beam and keep the degree of the transverse laser
cooling if we use a laser beam with sharp high-frequency
edge and decrease the frequency band to the value

|

[1 + 0.45R] .

(37)

9

In this case, ions of a monoenergetic ion beam interact
with the narrowband laser beam, according to (13), ob-
tain a spread of the closed orbits δση,f = 0.5Ψ(

and an energy spread

.

(38)

If the laser high-frequency edge corresponds to a mini-
mum decreased ion energy, the ions will be in time to be
cooled in the transverse plane and stop interaction with
the laser beam at this energy. To cool the monoenergetic
ion beam, the laser beam must have the frequency band
δωL1/ωL1 = 2δσε/ε. If the ion beam is not monoener-
getic, the laser beam must have the increased frequency
band (37). Then, the initial closed orbits of ions will be
located higher than the boundary orbit corresponding to
the maximum frequency of the laser beam and the ﬁnal
energy spread of the ion beam after its cooling in the
transverse plane will be equal to

k1
σε,f = σε0 + δσε = σε,0 [1 + 0.5Ψ(
|

)R]
|

|k1=k1,e =

σε0 (1 + 0.45R).

(39)

In this case the expressions (18), (19) (25) stay valid.

Example

54 Xe47+) in the RHIC stor-
ing of N-like Xenon ions (129
age ring when the transition between the ground state
(2s22p3) 4S3/2 and the excited state (2s22p4) 4P3/2 is
used. The RF acceleration system of the RHIC storage
ring is switched oﬀ. Enhanced ion beam cooling trans-
versely and fast cooling longitudinally by a homogenous
broadband laser with sharp high-frequency edge is used.

Cooling of the beam in the longitudinal plane can be
performed by a monochromatic laser beam with a scan-
ning frequency for the time determined by (35), which is
τx. It can be located in another straight section

of the storage ring. Unfortunately, using of the optical
resonator in this case (laser beam with a scanning fre-
quency) has problems.

In the methods of enhanced radiative ion cooling, the
laser beam does not have a sharp edge. Since the inten-
sity of the beam is changed with the displacement of the
ion orbits to the laser beam center, the laser beam will be
similar to the wedge-shaped target. Such targets when
they are at rest decrease the amplitudes of ion betatron
oscillations in the case of target T1 and increases them
in the case of target T2 in lesser degree than the target
with sharp edges. This means that the requirements for
sharpness of the laser target are not strong. A system of
lasers can be used to increase the sharpness of the eﬀec-
tive composite laser beam. For example, we can use in
the considered example a third laser beam of the same
maximum intensity as the ﬁrst one with the dimension
σL1 /4 intersecting the ion beam at a third straight
σL3 ≃
section of the storage ring with the displacement 2σL1
relative to the radial position of the ﬁrst laser.

V.

FAST IONIZATION COOLING OF MUON

BEAMS

Cooling of muon beams can be based on a friction
of muons in dense material targets installed in storage
rings. Such cooling follow from the features of muons
and material targets: 1) short muon lifetime (τ0
2.2µs,
207me), 2) absence of strong interactions of muons
mµ ≃
with nuclei of the target, 3) high rate of the muon energy
loss in the target [29] - [31]. In this case a target com-
pletely overlaps a muon beam, its transverse position is
motionless, all muons interact with the target indepen-
dently of their energy and amplitude of betatron oscil-
lations. Unfortunately, in this method the diﬀerence in
rates of momentum loss of muons having maximum and
minimum energies is small (limited by (8)).

≃

Below a method of fast two-dimensional ionization
cooling of muon beams in storage rings is considered.
This method is based on two processes: 1) enhanced ion-
ization cooling of muon beams in the longitudinal plane
accompanying by week heating of the beam in the trans-
verse plane, 2) fast ionization cooling of muon beams in
the transverse plane accompanying by near the same de-
gree of heating in the longitudinal plane (fast emittance
exchange through dispersion coupling ).

3 At present such lasers are in operation [26] - [27].
4 Finesse of 1.9 · 106 was reported near λ = 850 nm in [28].
5 The energy spread of the being cooled ion beam is limited by
quantum processes of Rayleigh scattering to the value σε,q ≃
2 < ¯hωs >= 118 keV.

A. Enhanced ionization cooling of muon beams in
the longitudinal plane

Enhanced cooling of muon beams in the longitudinal
plane is based on the energy loss of muons in a material

target T2 (see section 3) moving in the radial direction
back and forth between outside orbit to inside one when
the radio-frequency (RF) system of the storage ring is
switched oﬀ and material target is homogeneous and has
sharp edge in the radial direction. The target must be lo-
cated in the straight section of a storage ring (see Fig.3).
As a result, all muons will be gathered at the minimum
energy in a short time (33).

diofrequency cavity.

In this case ﬁnal muon betatron and dispersive beam
sizes are determined by (19) and (31) accordingly. The ef-
ﬁciency of enhanced longitudinal ionization cooling is the
higher the smaller the ratio R of the betatron to disper-
sion beam sizes in (31). It follows that the target T2 must
be installed in the straight section with high-dispersion
and low-beta functions. According to (19) and (31), the
enhanced longitudinal ionization cooling can lead to a
high degree of cooling of ion beams in the longitudinal
plane and to considerably lesser degree of heating in the
transverse one.

B. Fast ionization cooling of muon beams in the
transverse plane

Fast transverse cooling of muon beams by motionless
wedge-shaped material target T1 can be used [30, 32, 33].
In this case, according to (6), (7), damping times caused
by the target are determined by the expressions

scheme, according to (8), (41), is (ε/10σε)

103 times higher.
A phase displacement mechanism and eddy electric
ﬁelds can be used for the muon acceleration (the recov-
ery of the muon beam energy) and production of the
next cooling cycle. Cooling in the RF buckets can be
used as well. In this case, the energy losses of muons in
the laser beam target T2 per turn must be higher than
the maximum energy gain in the RF system to neglect
the inﬂuence of the RF ﬁelds on the enhanced cooling
process. Damping time in this case is smaller than the
period of synchrotron oscillations. The motion of the tar-
get T2 must be limited to the region xT2 > 0, frequency of
synchrotron oscillations must be high (decades of revolu-
tions) and the period of the target T2 oscillations must be
less (about 1/4) of the period of synchrotron oscillations.
Cooling of particle beams in RF buckets is a problem to
be considered elsewhere.

VI. FAST COOLING OF ELECTRON BEAMS

Enhanced cooling by a laser beam target T2 longitudi-
nally and a fast emittance exchange between longitudinal
and transverse radial planes by a motionless laser beam
target T1 can be used for fast two-dimensional cooling
of the electron beam (analogy of the fast muon cooling).
Backward Compton scattering is used for cooling [13],
[14]. The laser T1 has to be displaced from the reference
orbit, which is a synchronous one as well, to the distance
x = σL1/√2 towards the ring center to have the intensity
gradient along the radial direction of the Gaussian laser
beam. Under these conditions the damping decrements
of the radial betatron and synchrotron oscillations are
equal:

6 Enhanced cooling is not exponential in a cycle but exponential

when averaged over many cycles.

∼

In this case, we can not neglect synchrotron radiation
losses. Cooling in the RF buckets must be used. The
energy losses of electrons in the laser beam target T2 per
turn must be higher than the maximum energy gain in
the RF system to neglect the inﬂuence of the RF ﬁelds
on the enhanced cooling process. Damping time in this
case is smaller than the period of synchrotron oscillations.
The motion of target T2 must be limited to the region

12

xT2 > 0. Small gap and high magnetic ﬁeld microundu-
lator can be installed at the edge of the working region
of the storage ring instead of the laser beam target T2.
Ordinary high magnetic ﬁeld undulator with decreased
magnetic ﬁeld in the radial direction can be used instead
of the laser beam target T1.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have considered two non-resonance
schemes of enhanced cooling of particle beams when tar-
gets are moving in the radial direction. These schemes,
in combination with other schemes of fast cooling or
emittance exchange, permit to overcome the Robinson’s
damping criterion and to increase the rates of three-
dimensional cooling by

3 orders of their values.

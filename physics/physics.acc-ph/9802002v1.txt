Muon Dynamics in a Toroidal Sector

Abstract. We present a Hamiltonian formulation of muon dynamics in toroidal sector
solenoids (bent solenoid).

I

INTRODUCTION

The present scenario for the cooling channel in a high brightness muon collider
[1] calls for a quasi-continuous solenoidal focusing channel. The beam line consists
of a periodic array of hydrogen absorbers immersed in a solenoid with alternating
focusing ﬁeld and rf linacs at the zero ﬁeld points.

The simple dE

dx energy loss in conjunction with multiple scattering and energy
straggling leads to a decrease of the normalized transverse emittance. Reduction
of the longitudinal emittance could be achieved by wedges of material located in
dispersive regions; at least in principle, this scenario seems appropriate to obtain
eﬀective 6-D phase space reduction. [2]

A conventional chicane is a dispersion element but its use presents a serious
challenge, as it is very diﬃcult to integrate it with the solenoidal channel. The
matching into the periodic solenoidal system imposes constraints on the Twiss
parameters of the beam which seems not easily achievable. A possible alternative
is the use of curved solenoids in conjunction with wedge absorbers as suggested by
one of the authors. [3]

Solenoids and toroidal sectors have a natural place in muon collider design given
the large emittance of the beam and consequently, the large transverse momentum
of the initial pion beam or the decay muon beam. Bent solenoids as shown in Fig.1
were studied for use at the front end of the machine, as part of the capture channel
[4] and more recently as part of a diagnostic setup to measure the position and
momentum of muons. [5]

II TOROIDAL SECTOR SOLENOID

If we restrict ourselves for the moment to a horizontal bending plane, the mag-
netic ﬁeld inside of the solenoid and near the axis has a gradient (ﬁeld lines are
denser at smaller radius) described approximately by ~B(x, y, s) ≈ Bs~es with

Bs(x, y, s) ≈

Bs(0, 0, s)
(1 + hx)

where s is the coordinate along the particle trajectory and h = 1
Ro is the curvature
at the position s, with Ro the radius of curvature. As a consequence of the curvature
of the trajectory and the corresponding magnetic gradient, the center of the particle
guide orbit, averaged over the Larmor period, drifts in a direction perpendicular to
the plane of bending [6]. The combined drift velocity can be written as,

d~r

and the magnitude of the transverse drift velocity is

vT
drift =

(2v2

k + v2
⊥)

mµ
2qµ

h
(1 + hx)Bs

Clearly a y-position versus energy (v||) correlation will develop as the muon beam
travels along the toroidal sector solenoid.

From Eq.2 above we notice that if we include an additional vertical ﬁeld, a dipole

with a curvature equal to that of the bent solenoid for the reference energy, i.e.

then Eq.2 reduces to,

~BD ≈ −

|B|
v||

d~r

Bs

~es + (v|| − vo

and consequently, particles with the chosen energy will not drift vertically and will
remain on the axis of the bent solenoid. Those particles with larger energy will
drift upward (positive y-direction) and those with lower energy downward (negative
y-direction), achieving the needed dispersion. The magnitude of the dispersion is
given by

Dy = 2π

where po is the chosen momentum corresponding to zero dispersion.

HAMILTONIAN FORMULATION

From general principles of classical mechanics and following the usual approxi-

mations in accelerator physics [7] the normalized Hamiltonian reads,

H(x, px, y, py, z, δ; s) ≈ − q

p0 (1 + hx)As(s) − (1 + δ)hx

where the path length s is the independent variable, px , py are normalized momenta
with respect to p0, the initial reference total momentum p0 =
s; z =
and ~A = (Ax, Ay, As) is the vector potential. The vector
s − βoct, δ = (p−p0)
potential satisﬁes the gauge condition ∇ · ~A = 0.

In the accelerator frame of reference, i.e. the Frenet-Serret coordinate system

deﬁned by the metric,

dσ2 = dx2 + dy2 + (1 + hx)2ds2

the equations for the coordinate unit vectors are

We have written a simple Fortran program to solve the equations of motion from
the above Hamiltonian ; its result for a few representative cases of interest are
shown in Fig.2.

FIGURE 2. Example of dispersion created by a toroidal sector solenoid plus a vertical dipole.
We show several tracks with energies (±1%) larger and smaller than the reference energy po.

A second order expansion of the bent solenoid magnetic ﬁeld given in Eqs. 14 has
been used together with a second order expansion of the dipole magnetic ﬁeld in the
cooling simulation program ICOOL [9]. Fig.3a shows an example of the dispersion
Dy in a bent solenoid obtained in ICOOL as a function of the dipole strength BD.
It is apparent that the dependence of Eq. 6 on BD is well satisﬁed. Likewise, Fig
3b shows simulation results for the dispersion as a function of B−2
. Again we see
that the mentioned equation gives a good representation of the results.

Abstract

Various methods have been proposed to condition an electron
beam in order to reduce its emittance eﬀect and to improve the
short-wavelength free electron laser (FEL) performance. In this
paper, we show that beam conditioning does not result in a com-
plete elimination of the emittance eﬀect in an alternating-gradient
focusing FEL undulator. Using a one-dimensional model and a
three-dimensional simulation code, we derive a criteria for the
emittance limitation of a perfectly conditioned beam that de-
pends on the focusing structure.

1 Introduction

A primary factor limiting the performance of short-wavelength, high-gain free
electron lasers (FELs) is the electron beam transverse emittance. In order
to generate transversely coherent radiation with the diﬀraction limited emit-
tance λr/4π (λr being the radiation wavelength), the ideal electron transverse
emittance ε should be less than λr/4π for the eﬃcient beam-radiation inter-
action. This requirement is usually not met in the x-ray wavelength region.
The spread in the transverse betatron motion degrades the resonant FEL
interaction and limits the short-wavelength reaches of an x-ray FEL.

To mitigate this problem, it has been proposed to “condition” an electron
beam prior to the undulator by increasing each particle’s energy in proportion
to the square of its betatron amplitude [1]. This conditioning enhances the
FEL gain by reducing the axial velocity spread within the electron beam
generated over the undulator, due to both energy spread and ﬁnite transverse
emittances.

The original proposal [1] to condition the beam utilizes a set of cavities in
TM210 mode immersed in a focusing lattice. Later approaches to the problem
invoke a slow TM waveguide mode internal to the undulator [2], and an en-
ergy chirp in the beam in combination with a chromatic delay line [3, 4, 5, 6].
It has also been shown that an attempt to condition the beam on a short
distance is accompanied by a head-tail focusing variation which can result in
the large eﬀective transverse emittance growth [4]. Although this emittance
growth can be avoided [6], the pace of conditioning becomes much slower,
and the required length of the conditioner considerably increases. Other
proposals are based on using lasers and include Thomson backscattering [7],
and interaction of the laser with the electron beam in two dedicated undula-
tors [8]. Recently, beam conditioning using nonlinear RF acceleration is also
discussed [9].

In the FEL gain analysis of the original proposal [1], the undulator nat-
ural focusing is assumed to conﬁne the electron beam in both transverse
directions. This results in the complete elimination of the emittance eﬀect
for a perfectly conditioned beam. In this paper, we study a more practical
situation when the transverse focusing is provided by alternating-gradient
quadrupoles in the undulator, as found in typical x-ray FEL designs. We
show that although conditioning eliminates the eﬀect of the average slippage
of electrons relative to the radiation phase, there remain phase oscillations
with the period given by the focusing lattice. These phase oscillations can

aﬀect the FEL performance and impose a limitation on the beam emittance
even for a perfectly conditioned beam, albeit this emittance limitation is
much relaxed as compared to a unconditioned beam.

2 Emittance eﬀect in a strong focusing undu-

lator

Although a magnetic undulator can provide natural focusing in both trans-
verse planes [10], the focusing strength is typically too weak for the high-
energy electron beam that drives an x-ray FEL. Thus, alternating-gradient
quadrupole magnets are inserted in undulator breaks to provide the necessary
strong focusing, usually in the form of a FODO lattice (consisting of repeti-
tive focusing-undulator-defocusing-undulator cells). The horizontal betatron
motion is given by

2Jxβx cos Φx(z) ,

where Jx is the horizontal action of the electron, αx and βx are the Twiss
parameters, and px denotes the angle of the orbit with the z axis. The second
term in Eq. (1) is ignored in Ref. [11] under the smooth approximation. Its
importance in FEL dynamics and emittance compensation (i.e., conditioning)
is pointed out in Ref. [12].

To avoid a large beam size variation in the undulator, the FODO lattice
is usually designed to have a small phase advance per cell. In this case, the
average betatron wavelength 2π ¯β is much larger than the FODO cell length
Lc. In a ﬁrst approximation the beta function is constant over the length of
the undulator, and the accumulated betatron phase is

where φx is the initial electron phase. More importantly for the emittance
compensation, such a FODO lattice has [12]

The FEL interaction is a resonant phenomenon that depends critically on
the evolution of the electron phase relative to the co-propagating radiation
ﬁeld. The so-called ponderomotive phase is deﬁned as θ = (kr + ku)z

undulator period, and ¯t is the electron arrival time at the location z averaged

Since the last term of Eq. (9) is oscillatory with the FODO lattice period
(cell length), the main accumulating eﬀects on the ponderomotive phase are
the ﬁrst two terms. Neglecting this oscillatory term, the phase equation in
such a FODO cell is identical to that in a natural focusing undulator [13], as
noted in Refs. [12, 14]. For a beam with ﬁnite energy spread and emittance,
the ﬁrst two terms introduce phase slippage of the electron relative to the
radiation and result in the phase spread of the beam. Denoting
as the

FEL performance, the emittance-induced phase spread over one FEL power

However, when the beam is perfectly conditioned to satisﬁed Eq. (12),
the last oscillatory term in Eq. (9) is no longer negligible and can play a
limiting role with a large enough emittance. We discuss quantitatively this
remaining emittance eﬀect on the FEL performance for a conditioned beam
in the following two sections.

cillation

The ponderomotive phase oscillations in Eq. (9) depend on the transverse
variables through Jx, Jy, φx and φy and is a three-dimensional (3D) problem.
To isolate the oscillation eﬀect and to simplify the problem, we study a
heuristic one-dimensional (1D) model with the following phase equation

The above 1D model shows that when the maximum phase oscillation ampli-
tude exceeds unity, the FEL gain will be degraded as compared to the ideal
case. Therefore, for a perfectly conditioned beam that satisﬁes Eq. (12) in a
FODO lattice, the FEL performance will still be aﬀected by the emittance-
induced phase oscillations when the normalized emittance εn exceeds a crit-
ical emittance given by

(28)

Since this emittance criteria is derived with a heuristic 1D model, we
examine it using the 3D FEL code GENESIS [16]. The electron beam and
undulator parameters are given in Table 1. A typical FEL power evolution
(P versus z) is shown in Fig. 3 (blue dashed curve). The local power growth
rate 1/P (dP/dz) is also plotted in the same ﬁgure (green solid curve) and is
oscillatory with a period equaling to Lc/2 as a result of emittance-induced
phase oscillations.

We extract the FEL power gain length by averaging a relatively constant
1/P (dP/dz) over many oscillation periods in the GENESIS simulations. The
resulting gain length versus the normalized emittance is plotted in Fig. 4 for
¯β = 19 m and for three diﬀerent FODO cell lengths. We also compare the
simulation results with the theoretical gain length for a conditioned beam

Figure 3: (Color) GENESIS ampliﬁer run of a conditioned beam for Lc =
5.04 m, ¯β = 19 m and εn = 10 µm. The blue dashed curve is the FEL

in the absence of any phase oscillation. The latter is obtained by solving
the usual 3D eigenmode equation (see, e.g., Ref [17]) for the fundamental
Gaussian mode without any energy and angular spreads. As shown in Fig. 4,
the simulation results agree with the 3D theory that does not take into ac-
count phase oscillations up to the critical emittances predicted by Eq. (28).
For emittances exceed these critical values, the gain lengths extracted from
simulations start to increase faster than the ideal case.

We have also performed GENESIS simulations by varying the average
beta function ¯β while keeping the same focusing structure (with Lc = 2.64 m).
Figures 5 and 6 show the gain length comparisons for Lc = 2.64 m at ¯β =
9.4 m and 4.8 m, respectively. Combining with Fig. 4, we see that Eq. (28)
is reasonably accurate in predicting the critical emittances for diﬀerent beta
functions and FODO lattices.

As the ratio of the average beta function to the cell length becomes too
large (e.g., when ¯β = 39 m and Lc = 2.64 m or when ¯β = 19 m and
Lc = 1.44 m), the gain length extracted from the GENESIS simulation starts
to deviate from the 3D theory (without any phase oscillation) at a smaller
emittance than that predicted by Eq. (28). A plausible explanation is given
as follows. In x-ray FELs the transverse coherence builds up slowly as many
higher-order transverse modes are excited by an electron beam with a rela-
tively large emittance. To some degrees a periodic modulation in the electron

phase oscillation (black dashed curve). The colored symbols represent the
corresponding critical emittance for each lattice (determined by Eq. (28))

beam size along the undulator is beneﬁcial to the build-up of the transverse
coherence (namely higher order modes are suppressed by a varying beam en-
velope [18]). When the ratio of the beta function to the cell length becomes
too large, this higher-order suppression mechanism is not eﬀective since the
beam size is almost constant, and the growth of the radiation is contributed
from both the fundamental mode as well as higher-order modes. In this case,
the comparison between simulations (including higher-order modes) and the
theory (for the fundamental mode) is no longer valid.

5 Summary

In this paper, we study the FEL performance for a perfectly conditioned
beam in a strong focusing undulator consisting of FODO cells. We develop
a heuristic 1D model for the emittance-induced phase oscillation and show
that the maximum phase deviation should be less than unity in order not
to degrade the FEL gain. This criteria limits the maximum emittance that
may be conditioned in such a focusing channel and is conﬁrmed by the 3D
GENESIS simulations over a reasonably wide parameter range. Therefore,

instead of the usual emittance criteria for the unconditioned beam as given
by Eq. (10), the emittance of the conditioned beam in a FODO lattice with
an average beta function ¯β and a cell length Lc must satisfy

εn < γr

¯β
λr
πLc

.

(29)

That is, the emittance requirement for a conditioned beam is much relaxed
but not without any limitation.

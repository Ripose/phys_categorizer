Abstract

At the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a relatively strong effect. It is an effect
that couples all dimensions of the beam, and in April 2000, over a short period of time, all dimensions were measured. In
this report we derive a relation for the growth rates of emittances due to IBS; we apply the theories of Bjorken-Mtingwa,
Piwinski, Raubenheimer, and Le Duff to the ATF parameters, and ﬁnd that the results all agree well (if in Piwinski’s
formalism we replace η2/β by H); we compare theory with the measured data, and conclude that either the effect of IBS
is much stronger than predicted by calculations, or there are errors in the measurements.

INTRODUCTION

In future e+e- linear colliders, such as the JLC/NLC,
damping rings are needed to generate beams of intense
bunches with very low emittances. The Accelerator Test
Facility (ATF)[1] at KEK is a prototype for such damping
rings. In April 2000 the single bunch energy spread, bunch
length, and horizontal and vertical emittances of the beam
in the ATF were all measured as functions of current[2].
One surprising outcome was that, at the design current, the
vertical emittance appeared to have grown by a factor of
3 over the zero-current result. A question with important
implications for the JLC/NLC is: Is this growth real, or
is it measurement error? And if real, is it consistent with
expected physical effects, in particular, with the theory of
intra-beam scattering (IBS).

IBS is an important research topic for many present and
future low-emittance storage rings, and the ATF is an ideal
machine for studying this topic. In the ATF as it is now,
running below design energy and with the wigglers turned
off, IBS is relatively strong (for an electron machine). It
is an effect that couples all dimensions of the beam, and at
the ATF all beam dimensions can be measured. A unique
feature of the ATF is that the beam energy spread, an espe-
cially important parameter in IBS theory, can be measured
to an accuracy of a few percent. Evidence that we are truly
seeing IBS at the ATF include (see also Ref. [3]): (1) when
moving onto the coupling resonance, the normally large en-
ergy spread growth with current becomes negligibly small;
(2) if we decrease the vertical emittance using dispersion
correction, the energy spread increases.

Calculations of

IBS tend to use the equations of
Piwinski[4] (P) or of Bjorken and Mtingwa[5] (B-M). Both
approaches solve the local, two-particle Coulomb scatter-
ing problem under certain assumptions, but the results ap-
pear to be different. The B-M result is thought to be the
more accurate of the two, with the difference to the P re-
sult noticeable when applied to very low emittance stor-
age rings[6]. Other, simpler formulations are those by Le
Duff[7] and by Raubenheimer[8]. Also found in the lit-
erature is a more complicated result that allows for x-y
coupling[9], and a recent formulation that includes effects
of the impedance[10]. An optics computer program that
solves IBS, using the B-M equations, is SAD[11].

Calculations of IBS tend to be applied to proton or heavy
ion storage rings, where effects of IBS are normally more
pronounced. Examples of comparisons of IBS theory with
measurement can be found for proton[12],[13] and electron
machines[14]. In such reports, often a ﬁtting or “fudge”

factor is needed for good agreement with measurement
(e.g. Ref. [14]). In the present report we brieﬂy describe
the IBS formulations, apply them to ATF parameters, and
ﬁnally compare calculations with the data of April 2000.

2 IBS CALCULATIONS

We begin by sketching the general method of calculating
the effect of IBS in a storage ring (see, e.g. Ref. [4]). Let
us ﬁrst assume that there is no x-y coupling.

Let us consider the IBS growth rates in energy p, in the

horizontal x, and in the vertical y to be deﬁned as

.

(1)
Here σp is the rms (relative) energy spread, ǫx the horizon-
tal emittance, and ǫy the vertical emittance. In general, the
growth rates are given in both P and B-M theories in the
form (for details, see Refs. [4],[5]):

1
Ti

= hfii

(2)

where subscript i stands for p, x, or y. The functions fi are
integrals that depend on beam parameters, such as energy
and phase space density, and lattice properties, including
dispersion (y dispersion, though not originally in B-M, can
be added in the same manner as x dispersion); the brackets
hi mean that the quantity is averaged over the ring.

From the 1/Ti we obtain the steady-state properties:

ǫx =

ǫx0
1 − τx/Tx

, ǫy =

ǫy0
1 − τy/Ty

, σ2

p =

σ2
p0
1 − τp/Tp

,

(3)
where subscript 0 represents the beam property due to syn-
chrotron radiation alone, i.e. in the absence of IBS, and the
τi are synchrotron radiation damping times. These are 3
coupled equations since all 3 IBS rise times depend on ǫx,
ǫy, and σp. Note that a 4th equation, the relation between
bunch length σs and σp, is also implied; generally this is
taken to be the nominal (zero current) relation.

The best way to solve Eqs. 3 is to convert them into
3 coupled differential equations, such as is done in e.g.
Ref. [14], and solve for the asymptotic values. For exam-
ple, the equation for ǫy becomes

Note that:

• For weak coupling, we add the term −κǫx, with κ the
coupling factor, into the parenthesis of the ǫy differen-
tial equation, Eq. 4.

synchrotron radiation (SR) does. One difference between
IBS and SR is that IBS increases the emittance everywhere,
and SR only in bends. We can write

• A conspicuous difference between the P and B-M re-
sults is their dependence on dispersion η: for P the
fi depend on it only through η2; for B-M, through
[η′ + β′η/(2β)] and H = ¯γη2 + 2αηη′ + βη′2
, with
α, β, ¯γ Twiss parameters.

• Both formalisms include a so-called Coulomb log fac-
tor, of the form ln(2bmax/bmin), where bmin, bmax
are the minimum, maximum impact parameters, quan-
tities which are not well deﬁned. B-M take this term
to equal 20, and P takes bmin = r0 (the classical elec-
tron radius, 2.82 × 10−15 m), bmax = σy (the beam
height), which for the ATF yields ∼ 21.5. Another
estimate, given in Ref. [5], yields only 15.

• The IBS bunch distributions are not Gaussian, and tail
particles can be overemphasized in these solutions.
We are interested in core sizes, which we estimate
by eliminating interactions with collision rates greater
than the synchrotron radiation damping rate[15]. We
can do this in the Coulomb log term[16], which for
the ATF reduces its value to ∼ 13.

• At the ATF, at the highest single bunch currents, there
is signiﬁcant potential well bunch lengthening. We
can approximate this effect by adding a multiplicative
factor fpw(I) [I is current], obtained from measure-
ments, to the equation relating σs to σp.

2.1 Emittance Growth

tron beams is due to Raubenheimer [8],[17]: 1

with Jǫ the energy damping partition number. We can
solve Eqs. 3,5,6 to obtain the steady-state beam sizes. Note
that once the vertical orbit—and therefore hHyi—is set,
ǫy0 is also determined.

Following an argument in Ref. [8] we can obtain a rela-
tion between the expected vertical and horizontal emittance
growth due to IBS in the presence of random vertical dis-
persion: The beam momentum in the longitudinal plane is
much less than in the transverse planes. Therefore, IBS will
ﬁrst heat the longitudinal plane; this, in turn, increases the
transverse emittances through dispersion (through H), like

1Our equation for 1/Tp is twice as large as Eq. 2.3.5 of Ref. [8].

where Jx,y are damping partition numbers, and hib means

which, for the ATF is 1.6. If, however, there is only x-y
coupling, rǫ = 1; if there is both vertical dispersion and
coupling, rǫ will be between hHxib/hHxi and 1.

2.2 Numerical Comparison

Let us compare the results of the P and B-M meth-
ods when applied to the ATF beam parameters and lat-
tice, with vertical dispersion and no x-y coupling. We
take: current I = 3.1 mA, energy E = 1.28 GeV,
σp0 = 5.44 × 10−4, σs0 = 5.06 mm (for an rf voltage
of 300 kV), ǫx0 = 1.05 nm, τp = 20.9 ms, τx = 18.2 ms,
and τy = 29.2 ms; fpw = 1. The ATF circumference
is 138 m, Jǫ = 1.4, hβxi = 4.2 m, hβyi = 4.6 m,
hηxi = 5.0 cm and hHxi = 2.5 mm. To generate vertical
dispersion we randomly offset magnets by 15 µm, and then
calculate the closed orbit using SAD. For our seed we ﬁnd
that the rms dispersion (ηy)rms = 7.4 mm, hHyi = 17 µm,
and ǫy0 = 6.9 pm (Eq. 6 yields 7.0 pm).

Figure 1: Differential growth rates over 1/2 the ATF, as
obtained by Piwinski (blue) and Bjorken-Mtingwa (red).

Fig. 1 displays the 3 differential IBS growth rates
δ(1/Ti), over half the ring (the periodicity is 2), as obtained
by the two methods (blue for P, red for B-M). The IBS
growth rates 1/Ti are the average values of these functions.
We see good agreement for the differential rates of the two
methods in p and in x. In y the P results are enveloped by

the B-M results; on average the P result is 25% less. As
for the averages, for the B-M method 1/Tp = 26.3 s−1,
1/Tx = 24.8 s−1, 1/Ty = 18.5 s−1; σp/σp0 = 1.49,
ǫx/ǫx0 = 1.82, ǫy/ǫy0 = 2.17. The emittance ratio of
Eq. 8 is rǫ = 1.43, close to the expected 1.6. Finally, from
the arguments of Sec. 2.1, we might expect that we can im-
prove the P calculation if we replace η2
x,y/βx,y in the for-
mulation by Hx,y; doing this we ﬁnd that, indeed, all three
growth rates now agree with the B-M results to within 4%.
The dots in Fig. 1b,c give the differential rates corre-
sponding to Eq. 5, and we see that the agreement is also
good. The growth rates in (p,x,y) are (26.8,26.1,18.8) s−1,
the relative growths in (σp,ǫx,ǫy) are (1.51,1.91,2.21). Fi-
nally, the Le Duff method results also agree with B-M.

3 COMPARISON WITH

MEASUREMENT

The parameters σp, σs, ǫx, and ǫy were measured in the
ATF as functions of current over a short period of time at
rf voltage Vc = 300 kV. Energy spread was measured on a
screen at a dispersive region in the extraction line (Fig. 2a);
bunch length with a streak camera in the ring (Fig. 2b).
The curves in the plots are ﬁts that give the expected zero
current result. Emittances were measured on wire monitors
in the extraction line (the symbols in Fig. 3b-c; note that the
symbols in Fig. 3a reproduce the ﬁts to the data of Fig. 2).
We believe that ǫx measured is fairly accurate; ǫy, however,
since it is small, is more difﬁcult to measure accurately,
and might be corrupted by factors such as roll or dispersion
in the extraction line. We see that ǫx appears to grow by
∼ 80% by I = 3 mA; ǫy begins at about 1–1.5% of ǫx0, and
then grows by a factor of 3–2. If we are vertical dispersion
dominated and ǫy0 ≈ .012ǫx0, then the data satisfy Eq. 8,
rǫ ≈ 1.6, reasonably well; if we are coupling dominated,
however, rǫ ≈ 1 is not satisﬁed well.

Figure 2: Measurements of energy spread (a) and bunch
length (b), with Vc = 300 kV.

Let us ﬁt the B-M formalism to the data, with the
Coulomb factor as ﬁtting parameter. At I = 3 mA, with
fpw as measured, we adjust ln() until we ﬁnd agreement
for σp. In Fig. 3 we give examples: (1) with vertical dis-
persion only and ǫy0 = 12 pm (solid); (2) coupling dom-
inated with ǫy0 = 15 pm and (ηy)rms = 5 mm (dashes).
For these ﬁts ln() ≈ 29, a factor 2.2 times the 13 expected
for core emittances in the ATF. Conversely, with ln() = 13,

ﬁts (the curves). The symbols in (a) give the smooth curve
ﬁts to the measured data of Fig. 2.

for agreement with σp(I) we need ǫy0 = 3 pm, which is far
from the measurements [Example (3), y dispersion only;
dotdash in Fig. 3]. If, however, we assume a small amount
of ǫy measurement error we can obtain similar agreement
to before (e.g. add 1.1% coupling error; dots in Fig. 3c).

In conclusion, we have found that for the ATF, Bjorken-
Mtingwa, Piwinski (with η2/β replaced by H), Rauben-
heimer, and Le Duff methods all agree reasonably well
(though one needs to be consistent in choice of Coulomb
log factor). We have derived a relation for relative growth
rates of emittances due to IBS. Finally, ﬁtting to ATF mea-
surements of April 2000 we have found that either: the ef-
fect of intrabeam scattering is much stronger than predicted
by calculations, or there are errors in the measurements.

We thank A. Piwinski for help in understanding IBS and

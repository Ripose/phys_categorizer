Abstract

Building on the Renormalization Group (RG) method the beam-beam interaction
in circular colliders is studied. A regularized symplectic RG beam-beam map,
that describes successfully the long-time asymptotic behavior of the original sys-
tem has been obtained. The integral of motion possessed by the regularized RG
map has been used to construct the invariant phase space density (stationary
distribution function), and a coupled set of nonlinear integral equations for the
distributions of the two colliding beams has been derived.

1 Introduction

The problem of coherent beam-beam interaction in storage ring colliders is one of the most
important, and at the same time one of the most diﬃcult problems in contemporary acceler-
ator physics. Its importance lies in the fact that beam-beam interaction is the basic factor,
limiting the luminosity of a circular collider. Nevertheless, some progress in the analytical
treatment of the coherent beam-beam interaction has been made [1] - [4], it is still far from
being completely understood. In most of the references available the basic trend of analy-
sis follows the perturbative solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equations, where the linearized
system is cast in the form of an eigenvalue problem for the eigenmodes.

An important question, which still remains unanswered is how to determine the invariant
phase space density (equilibrium distribution function) if such exist. One possible way to
approach this problem is to ﬁnd an integral of motion (at least approximately) under certain
conditions. Then the invariant density can be expressed as a generic function of the integral
of motion. An attempt in this direction has been made by Alexahin [5], who used the Deprit
algorithm to determine the integral of motion (new action variable).

In the present paper we develop a novel approach to the beam-beam interaction in circular
colliders, based on the Renormalization Group (RG) method [6]. Originally this method
has been proposed as a singular perturbation technique for diﬀerential equations. Naive
perturbation expansions [7] are well-known to produce secular terms, thus limiting the range
of validity of the perturbation solution. The basic idea of the RG method is to remove secular
or divergent terms by renormalizing the integration constants of the lowest order perturbative
Its extension to discrete symplectic maps is however not straightforward, and
solution.
should be performed with care. Here we follow the regularization procedure outlined in
the paper by Goto and Nozaki [8]. As shown in [8] the naive RG map, obtained as a
result of renormalization of the lowest order solution preserves the symplectic symmetry only
approximately, and does not describe the long-term behavior of the original map correctly.
The symplecticity is recovered by a process of “exponentiation”, yielding a symplectic RG
map together with an explicit expression for the nonlinear tune shift. An alternative version
of the RG method, based on the envelope technique [9] has been applied to study non
symplectic maps.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next Section we derive the one-dimensional
nonlinear beam-beam map. In Section 3 the regularized RG map and its integral of motion
are obtained. The integral of motion thus found is further used in Section 4 to derive a set
of coupled integral equations of Haissinski type for the invariant phase space density.

2 The Nonlinear Beam-Beam Map

3 Renormalization Group Reduction of the Beam-

Beam Map

The one-turn beam-beam map, derived in the previous Section can be further simpliﬁed by
eliminating the canonical momentum variable p from (2.17). Multiplying the ﬁrst of Eqs.
(2.17) by cos 2πνk, multiplying the second one by
sin 2πνk, and summing the two equations
up we ﬁnd

where

qn+1 cos ωk −

pn+1 sin ωk = qn,

ωk = 2πνk.

where ǫ is a formal small parameter (set to unity at the end of the calculations), taking into
account the fact that the beam-beam kick is small and can be treated as perturbation.

Next we consider an asymptotic solution of the map (3.3) for small ǫ by means of the

RG method. The naive perturbation expansion

when substituted into Eq. (3.3) yields the perturbation equations order by order

of the vertical displacement q. In what follows it will prove eﬃcient to take into account
the fact that the beam-beam potential Vk(q) is an even function of the coordinate q. Odd
multipole contributions to Vk(q) will give rise to a shift in the closed orbit, and can be easily
incorporated in the the calculations presented below. It is straightforward to check that the
Fourier image of the beam-beam potential Vk(λ), deﬁned as

invariant and can be written as

It is important to emphasize that Eq. (3.38) comprises a transcendental equation for the
invariant Jk as a function of the canonical variables (q, p), since the coeﬃcients αk and βk
depend on Jk themselves.

4 The Invariant Phase Space Density

If an integral of motion Jk of the beam-beam map (2.17) exists, it can be proved that the
invariant phase space density f (I)
k (q, p) [which is a solution to the Vlasov equation (2.4)] is
a generic function of Jk, that is

f (I)
k (q, p) = Fk(Jk)

(k = 1, 2).

Here Fk(z) is a generic function of its argument. Since the integral of motion Jk is a functional
of the invariant density of the opposing beam f (I)

of nonlinear integral equations for the invariant densities of the two counter-propagating

5 Concluding Remarks

As a result of the investigation performed we have obtained a regularized symplectic RG
beam-beam map, that describes correctly the long-time asymptotic behavior of the original
system. It has been shown that the regularized RG map possesses an integral of motion,
which can be computed to any desired order. The invariant phase space density (stationary
distribution function) has been constructed as a generic function of the integral of motion,
and a coupled set of nonlinear integral equations for the distributions of the two colliding
beams has been derived. Based on the explicit form of the regularized RG map, the incoher-
ent beam-beam tune shift has been computed to ﬁrst order in the beam-beam parameter.

It is worthwhile to note that the method presented here is also applicable to study the
four-dimensional symplectic beam-beam map, governing the dynamics of counter-propagating
beams in the plane transverse to the particle orbit.

Abstract

Last two years were very important in history of a photon colliders. This option
is included now in conceptual design reports of the NLC, JLC and TESLA/SBLC
projects. All the designs foresee two interaction regions: one for e+e− and the
second for γγ, γe and e−e− collisions. This paper is focused on three aspects:
1) arguments for photon colliders; 2) parameters of current projects; 3) ultimate
luminosities and energies, new ideas. Recent studies have shown that the main
collision eﬀect - coherent pair creation - is suppressed at photon colliders with the
energy (2E < 2 TeV) due to the beam repulsion, and one can achieve, in principle,
the γγ luminosity exceeding 1035 cm−2s−1 . The required electron beams with very
small emittances can be obtained, for example, using a laser cooling of electron
beams. This new method requires a laser with a power by one order of magnitude
higher than that required for the “conversion” of electrons to photons. Such lasers
are not available today, but hopefully they will appear by the time when linear
colliders will be built. High energy γγ, γe colliders with the luminosity comparable
to that in e+e− collisions are beyond the competition in study of many phenomena
of particle physics.

1 Introduction

Let me remind brieﬂy the basic scheme of a photon collider [1],[2], see ﬁg.1. Two
electron beams after the ﬁnal focus system are traveling toward the interaction point
(IP). At a distance of about 0.1–1 cm upstream from the IP, at the conversion point
(C), the laser beam is focused and Compton backscattered by electrons, resulting in the
high energy beam of photons. With reasonable laser parameters one can “convert” most
of electrons into high energy photons. The photon beam follows the original electron
direction of motion with a small angular spread of order 1/γ, arriving at the IP in a tight

focus, where it collides with the similar opposing high energy photon beam or with an
electron beam. The photon spot size at the IP may be almost equal to that of electrons
at IP and therefore, the luminosity of γγ, γe collisions will be of the same order of
magnitude as the “geometric” luminosity of basic ee beams. The detailed description
of photon colliders properties can be found in refs [2]–[5] and in the Berkeley Workshop
Proceedings [6].

Now, this option is included into the Conceptual Design Reports of the NLC [7],
TESLA–SBLC [8] and JLC [9]. All these linear collider projects foresee the second
interaction region for γγ,γe collisions. This is quite a success but for ﬁnal decisions it
is necessary to have very clear justiﬁcation that photon colliders are realistic and can
substantially add to a discovery potential of linear colliders. Below are some arguments
for photon colliders.

1. Some phenomena can be studied at photon colliders better than anywhere, for
example, the measurement of γγ → Higgs width, which is sensitive to all heavy charged
particles; study of the vertex γγWW.

2. Cross sections for the pair production of charged scalar, leptons and top in γγ
collisions are larger than those in e+e− collisions by a factor of 5; for WW production
this factor is even larger: 10–20.

3. In γe collisions charged supersymmetric particles with masses higher than in e+e−

collisions can be produced (heavy charged particle plus light neutral).

4. The luminosity of photon colliders (in the high energy part of luminosity spec-
trum) with electron beam parameters considered in the present designs will be about
1033 cm−2s−1 or by a factor 5 smaller than Le+e−. But the absence of collisions eﬀects at
0.1 – 1 TeV photon colliders allows to reach Lγγ up to 1035 cm−2s−1 using electron beams
with very low emittances. High luminosity photon colliders can provide two orders high
production rate of WW pair and other charged particles (see item 2).

5. Obtaining of the ultimately high luminosities requires the development of new
techniques, such as the laser cooling of electron beams [12]. However, linear colliders

2

will appear (may be) only in one decade and will work next two decades. The upgrading
of the luminosity requires the injection part modiﬁcation only; it may be a separate
injector for a photon collider, merging of many low emittance RF-photoguns (with or
without laser cooling) is one of possible variants.

6. Linear colliders are very expensive facilities and their potential should be used in
the best way. Two detectors (one for e+e− and the other for γγ and γe) can give much
more results than the simple doubling of statistics in e+e− collisions with one detector .
7. Development of X-ray FEL lasers based on linear colliders (which are now under

way) will favour the work on FEL required for photon colliders.

2 Physics potential, requirements to γγ luminosity

The physics in γγ, γe colliders is very rich. The total number of papers devoted to the
physics at photon colliders approaches to one thousand. Some examples are given in the
introduction. Recent review of physics at photon colliders can be found in TESLA/SBLC
Conceptual Design Report [8] and in the talk of G. Jikia at this workshop.

The resonance production of Higgs in γγ collisions and measurement of its γγ width

is a task of primary importance.

Cross sections of the charged particle production in γγ collisions are higher than
those in e+e− collisions. At E ≫ Mc2 the ratio of cross sections are the following
→X+X−): RH +H − ∼ 4.5; Rt¯t ∼ 4; RW +W −(|cosϑ| < 0.8) ∼
(RXX = σγγ→X+X−/σe+e−
15; Rµ+µ−(|cosϑ| < 0.8) ∼ 8.5.

To have the same statistics in γγ collisions the luminosity may be smaller than that
in e+e− collisions at least by a factor of 5. Note that result in γγ and e+e− collisions
are complimentary even for the same ﬁnal states because diagrams are diﬀerent (for
example, the vertex γγWW can be studied only in γγ collisions).

A reasonable scaling for the required γγ luminosity (in the high energy peak of the

luminosity distribution) at γγ collider is

Lγγ ∼ 3 × 1033S(TeV2), cm−2s−1.

(1)

With such a luminosity one can detect 3.5×103 H +H −; 2×104 µ+µ−(|cosϑ| < 0.8); 2×
2 × 106 S(TeV2) W +W − for the time t =
104 t¯t;
107 c . Somewhat larger luminosity (∼ 1033) is required for the search and study of the
“intermediate” (MH ∼ 100 − 200 GeV) Higgs boson.

2 × 105 W +W −(|cosϑ| < 0.8);

With an electron beam considered in current projects [7], [8] with 2E∼500 GeV one
can obtain Lγγ ∼ 1033 cm−2s−1 at z = Wγγ/2E > 0.7 (see next section). It is determined
only by the “geometric” e−e− luminosity. Using beams with smaller emittances one
can get higher luminosity. Analyses of principle restrictions on luminosity of photon
colliders have shown [13] (see sect.4) that at 2E ≤ 5 TeV one can obtain (in principle)
Lγγ ≥ 1035 cm−2s−1.

3 Current projects

Recently, two groups NLC [7] and TESLA/SBLC [8] (and soon JLC) have published
Conceptual Design Reports of their linear collider projects containing comprehensive
appendixes devoted to γγ, γe options. Below is a short review of these designs.

3.1 Collision schemes

Two collision scheme were considered. scheme A (“without deﬂection”). There is no
magnetic deﬂection of spent electrons and all particles after the conversion region travel
to the IP. The conversion point may be situated very close to the IP; scheme B (“with
deﬂection”). After the conversion region, particles pass through a region with a trans-
verse magnetic ﬁeld (B ∼ 0.5–1 T) where electrons are swept aside. Thereby one can
achieve more or less pure γγ or γe collisions.

In both schemes, the removal of the disrupted spent beam is done by using the crab
crossing scheme with the crossing angle about 30 mrad. The maximum disruption angle
does not exceed 10 mrad and outgoing beams travel outside the ﬁnal quads located at a
distance about 2 m from the IP.

3.2 Conversion region. Requirements to lasers. Optics at the

IP.

The conversion region is situated at the distance b ∼ 1.5γσy = 0.5–1.5 cm from the IP.
An optimum laser wave length for the collider with 2E = 500 GeV is about 1 µm (for
x = 4E0ω0/m2c4 = 4.8) and grows proportionally to the beam energy. The required ﬂash
energy for obtaining the conversion coeﬃcient k ∼ 0.65 is about 1–4 J for an electron
bunch length σz = 0.1–0.5 mm, laser peak power is about 0.5–0.7 TW, average power is
about 20 kW.

Obtaining such parameters is possible with either solid state lasers or free electron
lasers. For λ > 1 µm (E0 > 250–300 GeV) FEL is the only option seen now. The
possible layout of optics near the IP is shown in ﬁg 2.

3.3 Luminosity

In current projects, the γγ luminosity is determined by the “geometric” ee–luminosity.
Due to the absence of beamstrahlung, beams in γγ collisions can have much smaller
horizontal beam size than that in e+e− collisions, therefore the beta functions were
taken as small as possible (some restrictions are posed by the Oide eﬀect connected with
chromatic aberrations due to synchrotron radiation in the ﬁnal quads).

Typical γγ luminosity distribution is broad with its peak at maximum invariant
masses at z = Wγγ/2E0 ∼ 0.8 (for x=4.8). The region z > 0.65 is the most valuable

lines – exit path of light coming from the left through one of the CP points (right to the
IP), the distance between the IP and quads is about 2 m

part of luminosity due to high energy and high degree of polarization. The luminosity
in this part is about 10% of the geometric ee luminosity.

The results of simulations for diﬀerent projects are the following. For the “nominal”
beam parameters (the same as in e+e− collisions) and the optimum ﬁnal focus system
the luminosity Lγγ(z > 0.65) ∼ (0.8/1.2/0.7) × 1033 cm−2s−1 for NLC/TESLA/SBLC.
The peak luminosity is also an important characteristic, it is approximately equal to
dLγγ/dz ∼ 7Lγγ(z > 0.65)/zmax. These numbers are close for the schemes with and
without magnetic deﬂection.

In the scheme without deﬂection, γe collisions can be studied simultaneously with
γγ collisions. In this case the γe luminosity is even higher than Lγγ by a factor of 1.5
(this is valid only for considered beam parameters; for very small beam sizes Lγe ≪ Lγγ
due to beam–beam repulsion). The magnetic deﬂection allows to obtain almost clean γe
collisions with FWHM∼7%.

There are several possibilities for increasing luminosity.
1) Reduction of the horizontal emittance by optimizing the damping rings. For
example, at the TESLA, the decrease in ǫnx by a factor 3.5 leads to an increase in Lγγ
up to 3 × 1033 cm−2s−1.

2) One can use the low emittance RF-photoguns instead of damping rings. Unfortu-
nately, even with best photoguns the luminosity will be somewhat lower than that with
damping rings. However, there is one possible solution. The normalized emittance in
photoguns is approximately proportional to the number of particles in the electron bunch.
It seems possible to merge (using some diﬀerence in energies) many (Ng ∼ 5 − 10) low
current beams with low emittances to one high current beam with the same transverse

5

emittance. This gives the gain in luminosity more than by a factor Ng in comparison
with one photogun (“more” because the lower emittance allows smaller beta functions
due to the Oide eﬀect). Joining beams from ﬁve photoguns with experimentally achieved
parameters leads at TESLA/SBLC to Lγγ = (3–4)×1033 cm−2s−1.

For a considerable step in luminosity the beams with much lower emittances are
required that needs the development of new approaches such as a laser cooling [12]
(sect.4.2). Potentially this method allows to attain the geometric luminosity by two
orders higher than those achievable by the methods discussed above. One example [8] of
the luminosity distributions for the “super” TESLA with round beams and emittances
by a factor 50 lower than that achieved with RF–photoguns is shown in ﬁg 3. Beam
parameters and resulting luminosities are given below.

Lγe = 3.6 × 1034, Lγe(z > 0.65) = 1.2 × 1034 cm−2 c−1,
Luminosities with magnetic deﬂection: b = 1.5 cm, B = 0.5 T,
Lγγ = 2 × 1034 , Lγγ(z > 0.65) = 1 × 1034 cm−2 c−1,
Lγe = 2.5 × 1033, Lγe(z > 0.65) = 6 × 1032 cm−2 c−1,

Results are impressive: Lγγ(z > 0.65) = (1–1.5)×1034 cm−2s−1 (2–3 times higher

than those in e+e− collisions). It is not the limit (see sect.4.3)

4 New ideas

6

4.1 Laser cooling

Recently [12], a new method was considered — laser cooling of electron beams — which
allows, in principle, to reach Lγγ ≥ 1035 cm−2s−1.

The idea of laser cooling of electron beams is very simple. During a collision with
optical laser photons (in the case of strong ﬁeld it is more appropriate to consider the
interaction of an electron with an electromagnetic wave) the transverse distribution of
electrons (σi) remains almost the same. Also, the angular spread (σ′
i) is almost constant,
because for photon energies (a few eV) much lower than the electron beam energy (several
GeV) the scattered photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional
spread. So, the emittance ǫi = σiσ′
i remains almost unchanged. At the same time,
the electron energy decreases from E0 down to E. This means that the transverse
normalized emittances have decreased: ǫn = γǫ = ǫn0(E/E0). One can reaccelerate the
electron beam up to the initial energy and repeat the procedure. Then after N stages of
cooling ǫn/ǫn0 = (E/E0)N (if ǫn is far from its limit).

Some possible sets of parameters for the laser cooling are: E0 = 4.5 GeV, le = 0.2
mm, λ = 0.5 µm, ﬂash energy A ∼ 10 J. The ﬁnal electron bunch will have an energy
of 0.45 GeV with an energy spread σE/E ∼ 13%, the normalized emittances ǫnx,ǫny are
reduced by a factor 10. A two stage system with the same parameters gives 100 times
reduction of emittances. The limit on the ﬁnal emittance is ǫnx ∼ ǫny ∼ 2 × 10−9
m rad at βi = 1 mm. For comparison, in the TESLA (NLC) project the damping rings
have ǫnx = 14(3) × 10−6 m rad, ǫny = 25(3) × 10−8 m rad.

This method requires a laser system even more powerful than that for e → γ conver-
sion. However, all the requirements are reasonable taking into account fast progress of
laser technique and time plans of linear colliders. A multiple use of the laser bunch can
reduce considerably an average laser power.

4.2 Stretching of laser focus depth

The laser and electron beams interact with each other most eﬃciently when laser and
electron beams have the same duration and the depth of laser focus (Rayleigh length)
is somewhat shorter than the beam length. It turns out that in many cases, the density
of laser photons is so high that instead of the Compton scattering an electron interacts
simultaneously with many photons (synchrotron radiation). This is not desirable since
in the regime of strong ﬁeld (eBλ > mc2) the spectrum of scattered photons after
conversion region is not so peaked as in the Compton scattering case. In the method of
laser cooling the strong ﬁeld leads to higher values of minimum emittance and higher
polarization loss. Of course, one can take laser bunch longer to keep collision probability
constant and the density of photons below the critical value. However, in this case, the
laser ﬂash energy should be larger than that under optimum conditions given in the
beginning of this paragraph. Due to this nonlinear QED eﬀect the laser ﬂash energy
required for photon colliders should grow proportionally to the collider energy [4],[5].

7

Recently [12], it was found how to avoid this problem.

In the suggested scheme
the focus depth is stretched without changing the radius of this area. In this case, the
collision probability remains the same but the maximum value of the ﬁeld is smaller. The
solution is based on use of chirped laser pulses and chromaticity of the focusing system 1.
In this scheme, the laser target consists of many laser focal points (continuously) and
light comes to each point exactly at the moment when the electron bunch is there. One
can consider that a short electron bunch collides on its way sequentially with many short
light pulses of length lγ ∼ le and focused with 2ZR ∼ le.

The required ﬂash energy in the scheme with a stretched laser focus is determined
only by diﬀraction and at the optimum wave length (x=4.8) does not depend on the
collider energy. The stretching of laser focus enables a substantial decrease in ﬂash
energy in the method of laser cooling, to achieve minimum emittances and to conserve
polarization of electron beams.

4.3 Ultimate luminosity and energy of photon colliders

The only collision eﬀect restricting γγ luminosity at photon colliders is the coherent pair
creation which leads to the conversion of a high energy photon into e+e− pair in the
ﬁeld of opposing electron beam [10],[4],[5]. There are three ways to avoid this eﬀect: a)
to use ﬂat beams; b) to deﬂect the electron beam after conversion at a suﬃciently large
distance from the IP; c) under certain conditions (low beam energy, long bunches) the
beam ﬁeld at the IP is below the critical one due to the repulsion of electron beams [11].
The problem of ultimate luminosities for diﬀerent beam parameters and energies was
analyzed recently in ref. [13] analytically and by simulation. Resume is the following.

The maximum luminosity is attained when the conversion point is situated as close
as possible to the IP: b = 3σz + 0.04E[TeV] cm (here the second term is equal to the
minimum length of the conversion region). In this case, the vertical radius of the photon
beam at the IP is also minimum: aγ ∼ b/γ (assuming that the vertical size of the
electron beam is even smaller). An optimum horizontal beam size (σx) depends on the
beam energy, number of particles in a bunch and bunch length. The dependence of the
γγ luminosity on σx for various energies and number of particles in a bunch is shown in
ﬁg.4. The bunch length is ﬁxed to be equal to 0.2 mm. The collision rate is calculated
from the total beam power which is equal to 15E[TeV] MW (close to that in current
In the ﬁg.4 we see that at low energies and small number of particles the
projects).
luminosity curves follows their natural behaviour L ∝ 1/σx while at high energy and
large number of particles in a bunch the curves make zigzag which is explained by γ →
e+e− conversion in the ﬁeld of the opposing beam.

What is remarkable in these results? First of all, the maximum attainable luminosities
are huge. At low energies there are no coherent pair creation even for a very small σx
when the ﬁeld in the beam is much higher than the critical ﬁeld Bcr = αe/γr2
e. This is
1In a chirped pulse the wave length is linearly depends on longitudinal position. Such pulses are

obtained and used now in all short-pulse lasers.

8

explained by the fact that beams during the collision are repulsing each other so that the
ﬁeld on the beam axis (which aﬀects on high energy photons) is below the critical ﬁeld.
It means that the γγ luminosity is simply proportional to the geometric electron-electron
luminosity (approximately Lγγ(x > 0.65) ∼ 0.1Lee) for σx, σy > b/γ ∼ 3σz/γ + 0.2 nm.
For the energies 2E< 2 TeV which are in reach of next generation of linear colliders the
luminosity limit is much higher than it is required by our scaling low given by Eq.1.

4.4 Backgrounds

One of important problems at high luminosities is a background due to relatively large
total cross section σγγ→hadrons ∼ 5 × 10−31 cm2.

The average number of hadron events/per bunch crossing is about one at Lγγ(z >
0.65) = 2 × 1034 cm−2s−1 at the typical collision rate 10 kHz. However, in the scheme
without deﬂection the total γγ luminosity is larger than the “useful” Lγγ(z > 0.65) by
a factor 5–10. This low energy collisions increase background by a factor 2–3 [8].

Let us assume the photon collider luminosity to be Lγγ(z > 0.65) ∼ 1035 cm−2s−1 (top

Figure 4: Dependence of the γγ luminosity on the horizontal beam size for σz = 0.2 mm,
see comments in the text.

of our dreams), this leads to about 15 (eﬀectively) high energy γγ → hadron events per
bunch crossing. Approximately the same number (∼30) of events/collision is expected
in detectors at the LHC . However, there is an important diﬀerence between pp and γγ
in the case of an interesting event (high Pt jets or leptons) the total energy
colliders:
of ﬁnal products at photon colliders is equal to Ecm, while at proton colliders it is only
about (1/6)Ecm. In comparison with the pp collider the ratio of the signal to background
at photon colliders is better by a factor of 6 at the same number of hadronic events per
crossing. Note, however, that at NLC and JLC the time between collisions is only about
1.5 ns and background from a few neighbouring events will overlap. At more realistic top

conditions will be acceptable. These arguments and detailed simulation [8] show that
the problem of hadronic background is not dramatic for photon colliders.

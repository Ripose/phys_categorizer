Abstract

In this paper we propose an improved empirical equation for the bunch
lengthening in electron storage rings. The comparisons are made between the
analytical and experimental results, and the agreements are quite well. This
improved equation can be equally applied to the case where a storage ring is
very resistive (such as the improved SLC damping rings) instead of inductive
as usual.

1

Introduction

From what we know about the single bunch longitudinal and transverse instabil-

ities [1][2], it is clear to see that the information about the bunch lengthening,

Rz = σz/σz0, with respect to the bunch current is the key to open the locked

chain of bunch lengthening, energy spread increasing and the fast transverse insta-

bility threshold current. In this paper an improved (compared with what we have

proposed in ref. 3) empirical bunch lengthening equation is proposed as follows:

In fact, the third term of eqs. 1 is due to the Collective Random Excitation eﬀect

revealed in ref. 1, except a new factor

which is introduced in this paper to include

D

the special case where Zi has the same order of magnitude or even less than Zr.

The second term, however, is obtained intuitively as explained in section 3. Now

we make more discussions on Zi and Zr. Being aware of the possible ambiguity

coming from this frequently used term in the domain of collective instabilities in

storage rings, we deﬁne Zr and Zi used in this paper as follows:

The procedure to get the information about the bunch lengthening and the en-

ergy spread increasing is ﬁrstly to ﬁnd Rz(Ib) by solving bunch lengthening equa-

tion, i.e., eq. 1, and then calculate energy spread increasing, Rε(Ib) (Rε = σε/σε,0),

by putting Rz(Ib) into eq. 7 [1]:

Once Rε(Ib) is found, one can use the following formula to calculate the fast single

bunch transverse instability threshold current [2]:

2 Comparison with Experimental Results

In this section we look at seven machines with their parameters shown in table 1.

Table 2: The machine energy and the total loss factors.

Concerning the loss factors, that of INFN accumulator ring comes from ref. 6 and

the others are obtained by ﬁtting the corresponding experimental results with the

bunch lengthening equation given in ref. 1. Figs. 1 to 10 show the comparison re-

sults between the analytical and the experimental [8]-[18] bunch lengthening values,

3

and Fig. 11 shows the single bunch energy spread increasing. It is obvious that

this improved empirical bunch lengthening equation is quite powerful. Among the

seven diﬀerent storage rings, SLC new damping ring is the unique and the most

interesting one since it is a very resistive ring [16], on the contrary, the other rings

including SLC old damping ring are quite inductive. The inductances of the old and

the new SLC damping rings are 33 nH and 6 nH, respectively [17]. By ﬁtting the

bunch lengthening experimental results, one ﬁnds that the loss factor

tot
||,0 equals
12 V/pC at σz0 = 0.53 cm (this value is put in table 2), which agrees quite well

K

with the experimentally measured loss factor, 15 V/pC, at the same bunch length

[18]. From Fig. 11 one can see that the single bunch energy spread increasing in

SLC new damping ring is rather accurately predicted by eq. 7.

3 Discussion

In fact eq. 1 can be obtained from the following equation by truncating the Taylor

expansion of the right hand side of eq. 11 up to the second order.

From the point of view of aesthetics, eq. 11 is more attractive (at least for the

author). Even if it doesn’t work well itself, this equation is instructive for us to

establish the second term in eq. 1.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we propose an improved empirical bunch lengthening equation and

compare the analytical results with the experimental results of seven diﬀerent ma-

chines where SLC new damping ring is quite resistive. The agreement between the

analytical and experimental results is quite satisfactory. The factor

introduced

in this paper should be included (one should multiply it to

tot
||,0) into the corre-
sponding formulae in ref. 1 also in order to be applied to the case where a storage

K

D

ring is very resistive.

Abstract

The design of the LHC and future colliders aims their operation with high intensity
beams, with bunch population, Np, of the order of 1011. This is dictated by a
desire to study very rare processes with maximum data sample. HEP colliders are
engineering structures of many kilometers in length, whose transverse compactness
is achieved by the application of the superconducting technologies and limitations
of cost. However the compactness of the structural elements conceals and potential
danger for the stable work of the accelerator. This is because a high intensity beam
of positively charged particles (protons, positrons, ions) creates around itself an
106 V/cm. Being located near the
electric self-ﬁeld of very high intensity, 105
conducting surfaces, at the distances of 1-20 mm away from them, the ﬁeld of
such bunches activates the ﬁeld emission of electrons from the surface. These
electrons, in addition to electrons from the ionization of residual gases, secondary
electrons and electrons knocked out by synchrotron radiation, contribute to the
development of a dense electron cloud in the transport line. The particles of
Np, leaves
the bunch, being scattered on the dense electron cloud with Ne ∼
the beam and may cause noticeable damage. The paper presents an analysis
of the conditions, under which the ﬁeld emission in the LHC collimator system
may become a serious problem. The analogous analysis of a prototype of the
International Linear Collider (ILC) project, USLC, reveals that a noticeable ﬁeld
emission will accompany positron bunches on their entire path during acceleration.

To achieve this goal it is necessary to have beams with maximal bunch population, Ni, large
number of bunches, nb, and bunches with minimal transverse sizes, σx, σy. The electric and
magnet self-ﬁelds created by an intense particle bunch, with modiﬁcation by the accelerator
environment (beam pipe, accelerator gaps, magnets, collimators, etc.) due to induced surface
charges or currents, can have very high values at a distance of the order of a few millimeters
from the bunch.

It is a well known fact that under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld F of the order of
105 V/cm at room temperature the smooth surface of solids (conductors, semiconductors,
dielectrics) and liquids emits electrons3 (see [1] and references therein). The phenomenon,
known now as electron ﬁeld emission (FE), was discovered by Robert Wood [2] in 1897. Later,
in 1928, Fowler and Nordheim [3] proposed a quantum theory of ﬁeld emission from metals in
terms of electrons tunneling through a potential barrier. Application of a high electric ﬁeld
to the metal produces a triangular shaped potential energy barrier through which electrons,
arriving at the metal surface, may quantum mechanically tunnel.

Such electron emission usually precedes electrical breakdown in vacuum and is called
pre-breakdown emission. We note that the maximum ﬁeld strength that can be maintained
between two conductors in air is limited to less than about 104 V/cm, above which dielectric
breakthrough leads to the formation of a plasma. With semiconductors, of the order of 106
V/cm can be maintained. Fields of the order of 108 V/cm = 1 V/˚A can also be established
within 103 ˚A of a metal tip with a tip radius of less than 103 ˚A, provided breakthrough is
avoided by working in ultrahigh vacuum. In ﬁelds larger than 1 V/˚A a variety of processes
start to develop: ﬁeld desorption4, ﬁeld evaporation5, vacuum discharge.

In this paper, we discuss the ﬁeld emission phenomena activated in strong ﬁelds created by
a positively charged particle beam. Primary attention is paid to the ﬁeld emission processes
and beam induced multipacting in the LHC collimator system. The primary and secondary
collimators in the IR3, IR6 and IR7 insertions are made of graphite [77]-[83] with parallel jaw
surfaces and small gaps,
2 mm, at 7 TeV. As shown below, for the LHC bunch parameters
and structural features of the LHC collimator system, the density of the electron emission
current can reach a signiﬁcant magnitude, which in turn can lead to a ”thrombosis” of the
collimators.

∼

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy review the classical Fowler-
Nordheim theory for point cathodes, following which we give an estimation of the tunneling
time and discuss deviations from the F-N theory due to extensions to non-zero temperatures
and ”real” broad-area cathodes. In Section 3 we discuss electrical self-ﬁelds generated by
charged particles encountered in high energy physics: an elementary particle, a relativistic
dipole, a particle bunch. In Section 4, the results of studies made with the use of the modiﬁed
F-N theory are presented. Here we discuss the ﬁeld emission in the LHC collimator system
3We denote the electric ﬁeld by F follow the established tradition in publications devoted to ﬁeld emission.
4Field desorption is a process in which an atom or molecule leaves a solid surface due to the inﬂuence of a high

electric ﬁeld. The atom or molecule usually departs from the surface in a charged state as an ion.

5Field evaporation is the removal of lattice atoms as singly or multiply charged ions from a metal in a strong

electric ﬁeld F of the order of several V/˚A, as occurs at ﬁeld ion tips.

dynamics of emitted electrons, the electron multiplication chain, and the development of an
electron cloud in the self-ﬁelds of a bunch.

2 Field Emission in Strong Electric Fields

2.1 Fowler-Nordheim theory

In the framework of Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) theory, the current density of ﬁeld emission of
electrons from a metal can be written in the following form [3],[4]-[11]

JF N = e

Ex, F )d

where D(

Ex, F ) is the penetration coeﬃcient and n(

Ex) is the number of electrons at the
Ex incident in the x-direction on the surface barrier from inside of the metal.
An electron outside a metal is attracted to the metal as a result of the charge it induces on
the surface (image force). In the externally applied accelerating electric ﬁeld F , the potential
energy of the electron is6

where x denotes the distance from the surface and the ﬁrst term accounts for the image
potential. With use of the potential energy (3) and the Fermi energy distribution of electrons
in the conduction band, one ﬁnds [3],[4]-[11] that

The Nordheim function ϑ(y) takes into account a lowering of the potential barrier due
to the image potential (the Schottky eﬀect) and its distinction from an idealized triangular
shape. The function t(y) in the denominator of equation (4) is deﬁned as

−

The function ϑ(y) varies from ϑ(0) = 1 to ϑ(1) = 0 with the increase in ﬁeld strength,
however t(y) is quite close to unity at all values of y.

For a typical metallic ϕ of 4.5 eV, ﬁelds of the order of 107 V/cm are needed to have
measurable emission currents. In considering magnitudes, one must always keep in mind the
rapid variation of the exponential function. For instance, an increase in F of only a factor of

107 V/cm increases the current density by 15 orders of magnitude

At a ﬁeld strength of the order of Fcr = ϕ2/e3 = 6.945

solid to lose their integrity.

For a long time only tabulated values of ϑ(y) and t(y) [14] were used in calculations,
see [5]-[11]. Recently [15], several parameterizations of the functions ϑ(y) and t(y) were
proposed.

The theory of ﬁeld emission from metals has been subjected to fairly extensive veriﬁcation.
A variety of methods have been employed over many years for the experimental measurements
of the emission current as a function of the ﬁeld strength, the work function and the energy
distribution of the emitted electrons [7]-[11]. The F-N theory (4) of electron emission from
plane and uniform metal surfaces (single-crystal plane) at T
0 may therefore be considered
well established on experimental basis as well as on theoretical grounds.

2.2 Tunneling Time

Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle one can estimate the tunneling time. For electrons
near the Fermi level, the uncertainty in their momenta, ∆p, should correspond a barrier of
height ϕ where

Here the ﬁeld strength F is in V/cm, the work function ϕ is in eV and the tunneling time
∆t is given in seconds. As an example, for graphite and a ﬁeld of 106 V/cm this gives
10−14 s, quite a short time scale, when the ﬁeld is large. If the ﬁeld is created by
∆t = 7.23
a relativistic bunch of length L, the ﬁeld is acting on a certain area of the surface during the
10−10 s, which is long
time τ = L/c. For a LHC bunch of L=7.55 cm one obtains τ = 2.52
in comparison with the emission time ∆t.

2.3 Deviations from the Fowler-Nordheim theory

2.3.1 Temperature dependence

The main equation (4) of the F-N theory was derived for an idealized metal in the framework
of the Sommerfeld model, with an ideally ﬂat surface and at a very low temperature, T
0.
The temperature dependence of the ﬁeld emission current (FEC) is completely connected
with the change of the spectrum of electrons in the metal with an increase in T . Therefore,
at non-zero temperatures the F-N theory must be modiﬁed to take into account the thermal
excitation of electrons above the Fermi level. For the so-called extended ﬁeld emission region,
Murphy and Good [5] (see also [6],[11]) obtained the following elegant equation

≈

which account for the temperature dependence of the FEC. Here ω = kB T /kB T0 and

where kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature in K. It can be

The energy distribution of the emitted electrons is determined by two eﬀects: the low-
energy slope by the tunneling probability, and the high-energy slope by the electron distri-
bution in the metal, and thus by the temperature T of the emitter. For increasing ﬁelds, the
width of the energy distribution will grow approximately with the ﬁeld, while the position
of the spectrum stays close to the Fermi level, EF [11]:

2.3.2 Anomalous High FEC

Since the ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcations of the F-N ﬁeld emission theory, it was noticed
that for broad-area cathodes the electrical breakdown typically occurs for ﬁeld values one
or two orders of magnitude smaller and pre-breakdown FEC is many orders of magnitude
greater than the values predicted by the F-N equation. Nevertheless the observed emission

5

→

current follows the F-N law, provided one makes the substitution F
Fef f = βF N F for all
occurrences of F in (12) [19, 20, 21, 22]. Here βF N is known as the ﬁeld enhancement factor.
Generally, βF N values in the range 50 < βF N < 1000 have been observed in many experiments.
Emission does not occur homogeneously over the surface but is rather concentrated in µm and
sub-µm sized spots [1, 20, 24]. Then electrons are concentrated in tiny jets and with further
increase in voltage, this ultimately leads to breakdown. Physics of the local ﬁeld enhancement
and a vacuum arc discharge, in general, is very complex and still not completely understood.
For reviews see [20],[25], [28]. As one sees from (4) , FEC increases both with an increase of
F as well as with decrease of ϕ, or due to a combination of these two factors. There are a
number of mechanisms which lead to an increase of FEC. Here we enumerate some of them.
Geometrical ﬁeld enhancement. The real surface of solids is not perfect. For many
years, the anomalous emission was universally explained by invoking a ’projection model’
[19, 20, 22, 23]. This model assumes the presence on the cathode surface of a number of
microscopic projections (crystalline defects, impurities, whiskers or dust particles), sharp
enough to cause a geometric enhancement of the local ﬁeld at the projection tip to a value
some 100 times greater than the nominally applied ﬁeld. The projection model was conﬁrmed
by experimental evidence [1, 20, 23] obtained with shadow/scanning electron microscopy.
Even on optically polished cathodes made of stainless steel, tungsten, copper or aluminum,
needle-like projections about 2 µm high have been found. These projections are capable of
producing ﬁeld enhancements of the order of 100 at pre-breakdown emission sites.

Resonant tunneling. To account for enhanced emission from gas condensation, another
model assumes that ad-atoms are responsible for creating localized energy levels near the
surface. One dimensional calculations [32] show that the tunneling process of electrons with
energies close to the localized states can be resonantly enhanced. The calculations predict
that tunneling is enhanced by up to a factor of 104 for adsorbates less than a single monolayer
thick. For example, adsorbed water with its strong dipole moment can be a critical factor
in enhanced electron ﬁeld emission [33]. Water is certainly one of the main adsorbates on
the conductor surface, especially if the surface is not baked. There is also observation that
adsorbed oxygen enhances ﬁeld emission [34].

−∞

Surface states (SS). By the level of complexity, this is a completely diﬀerent mechanism
resulting the FEC increase due to a lower electron work function of SS. A semi-inﬁnite crystal
extending from x =
to x = 0 can be viewed as a stack of atomic layers parallel to the
given crystallographic plane but, in contrast to the inﬁnite crystal, all layers cannot in general
be identical. Consequently, the potential the electron sees at the metal-vacuum interface is
unavoidably diﬀerent from that in the bulk material because the electronic charge distribution
is diﬀerent on the surface. On metal surfaces, the density of electrons is high, of the order
of 1015 cm−2. That gives rise to creation and decay of a variety of electronically excited SS
[39, 40, 11]. The term applies because the wave function of such a state is localized near
the surface, decaying ”exponentially” on either side of it. The surface states are classiﬁed
as Tamm [36] and Shockley [37] surface states (TSSS), and image potential states (IPS)
[38]. Tamm states are more localized and arise when the potential in the top surface layer
is signiﬁcantly distorted, whereas Shockley states show a strong free-electron-like dispersion
and may be interpreted as dangling bonds of surface atoms. Such SS are described by
wave functions whose center of gravity lies in the immediate neighborhood of the metal-
vacuum interface on the metal side of it. Self-consistent calculations [41] and angle-resolved
photoemission measurements [42], have shown that such states exist on the (100) plane of
copper. Employment of scanning tunneling microscopy at low temperatures allows one to
detect the surface topology and view SS of many noble metals. For a state-of-the-art review
see [49].

Image potential states [38] (see also [46]-[49], [39]), arise for an additional electron in front
of the surface. The screening of the charge by the metal electrons give rise to a long-range
Coulomb-like attractive image potential which leads to bound states which form a Rydberg
series with energies En, where

to identify IPS on graphite [50]. For IPS on graphite a quantum defect of a =
is obtained. This demonstrates that IPS on graphite exhibit an almost ideal hydrogen-like
behaviour. The maximum of the IPS wave function density with n=1 is located several
Angstroms away from the surface at the vacuum side [47, 64].

Fullerenes, nanoparticles, nanotubes etc [51]-[53]. The LHC collimator jaws are
made of graphite [78]-[84]. Graphite can be polished only mechanically, and therefore may
serve as a large area emission surface. The simplest explanation for this is that the surface
morphology [54] consists of countless fractures, protrusions, edges, and other features which
are readily demonstrated to emit electrons with ﬁeld enhancement. Fig 1 shows the typical
graphite surface at high magniﬁcation [62]. In conjunction with the previous discussion, we
shall consider brieﬂy some properties of graphite and its derivatives.

Graphite consists of layers which are formed by regular hexagons. Partial thermal decom-
position of graphite layers (as a result of heating at higher local emission current densities)
can produce on the surface fullerene molecules, nanoparticles and also long tiny tubes, nan-
otubes. Under the inﬂuence of a high voltage ﬁeld these objects are able to emit electrons.
The C60 molecule occupies the central place among fullerenes. This molecule resembles
the commonly-used surface of a football. The carbon atoms are distributed on a spherical
surface at the vertices of twenty regular hexagons and twelve regular pentagons. The radius
of the C60 molecule, deduced from X-ray structure analysis [56], is 0.357 nm. The common
structural components found in graphite and the C60 fullerene molecule determine the nature
of the process of formation of fullerenes by the decomposition of graphite. Moderate heating
of graphite breaks the bonds between the separate layers and an evaporated layer then splits
into separate fragments. These fragments are combinations of hexagons one of which becams
used to form a cluster.

The process of formation of fullerenes from graphite yields further various structures
which are composed, like graphite, of six-member carbon rings. These structures are closed
and empty inside. They include nanoparticles and nanotubes. The nanoparticles are closed
structures similar to fullerenes, but of much larger size. In contrast to fullerenes, they may
contain several layers. Such multilayer spherical structures are called onions. The study
[55] of ﬁeld emission properties of diamond-like carbon ﬁlms indicate that the ﬁlms have a
faceted morphology with carbon cluster size in the range 150-400 nm. The ﬁtting of I-F
(current-electric ﬁeld) data to the F-N equation gives βF N ≃
Separate extended graphite fragments, which are then vent into a tube, form the base of CNT.
These tubes are up to several microns long with diameters of a few nanometers. They are
multilayer structures with rounded ends. One end is attached to a surface and the other is
free.

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are elongated structures with surfaces formed by regular hexagons.

160, assuming ϕ = 5 eV.

Figure 1: Typical rough graphite surface [62].

As follows from direct measurements [57]-[63], CNT have quite a high ﬁeld emission
capability. This property centers around the extraordinarily small diameter of CNT, which
provides a sizeable enhancement of the electric ﬁeld strength near the CNT cap in relation to
that averaged over the entire volume of the interelectrode gap. For instance, at a voltage near
650 V, an emitting area of about 1 mm2 provides an emission current of order 0.5 mA. The
measured emission characteristics correlate well with the F-N equation, with the condition
that the value of the electric ﬁeld strength is taken at the point of the electron emission.
Since this point is situated close to the sharpened top of the CNT cap, the local magnitude
of the electric ﬁeld considerably exceeds its mean value. Thus, the above mentioned eﬀect
of ﬁeld enhancement becomes involved, with the magnitude of βF N estimated to be of the
order of 1000, assuming the work function to be close to ϕ = 5 eV.

High emission properties of CNT cannot be attributed only to their high aspect ratio.
As demonstrated in model calculations and measurements [64, 65], single- and multiwalled
CNT generate both IPS as discussed above and a new class of surface states, the tubular
image states, owing to their quantized centrifugal motion. Measurements of binding energies
and the temporal evolution of image state electrons were performed using femtosecond time-
resolved photoemission. A cluster of IPS with n=1 is located near 0.75 eV below the vacuum
level. These data are in agreement with results obtained in the course of studies of the
emission properties of CNT [60, 66]. The values of the eﬀective work function calculated
from the Fowler-Nordheim plot are in the range 0.3
1.8 eV and the highest value of βF N
extracted from the data is of the order of 1300.

3 The Electric Field of Relativistic Charges

3.1 Single Charged Particle

The electric ﬁeld of a charged particle at rest is spherically symmetric.
If the particle is
moving with a uniform velocity v in an inertial frame S, its electric ﬁeld is deformed: along
the direction of motion the electric ﬁeld becomes weaker by a factor γ2, while in the transverse
direction the electric ﬁeld is enhanced by a factor γ. Here, γ denotes the particle Lorentz
factor.

Let (x, y, z) be the coordinates and ~r the position vector of the point P in S, the z-axis
of the frame being taken along the direction of motion of the charged particle. Then the
components of the electric ﬁeld produced by a rapidly moving charge q are [16], [17]

where the value of κ depends on the system of units used, in our case κ = 1 7. We use
the particle charge q rather than the elementary charge e to include particles with multiple
charges such as ions for which q = Ze. At t = 0 and z = r cos θ, where θ is the angle which
the vector ~r makes with the z-axis, equation (19) can be rewritten in the form

Thus, the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at θ = 0◦ or θ = 180◦, Fk, is given by

while in the transverse direction, the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is

As seen from Eq.(22), the increase of the strength of the electric ﬁeld in the transverse
direction corresponds eﬃciently to an increase of the particle electric charge, Qef f = γZe.

In accelerators, charged particles move in front of conducting surfaces and one has to
account for the image charge induced by the particle. In this section we discuss only the case
when a positively charged particle is moving parallel to a grounded conducting plane. The
particle and the image charge form a dipole. The complete form of the electric ﬁeld vector
of the relativistic dipole is presented in Appendix .

Let the surface of the conductor coincide with the (y,z)-plane and (0,y,z) be a point on
the plane. The electric ﬁeld at this point is normal to the surface and is directed into it.
The components of the ﬁeld from a positive point charge, located at the distance h above
the plane, are (see Appendix)

From equation (24) we conclude that only particles with ultra-high energies are able to
produce signiﬁcant ﬁeld strengths at macroscopic distances. Let us substitute in (24) the
numerical values of constants. That gives

1.75 TeV or a proton of energy 3.25

which coincides with the external ﬁeld of a continuous beam with the linear charge density
λ = qN/L.

In an accelerator, a charged beam is inﬂuenced by its an environment (beam pipe, mag-
nets, collimators, etc.), and a high-intensity bunch induces surface (image) charges or currents
into this environment. This modiﬁes the electric and magnetic ﬁelds around the bunch. For
instance, if the bunch is moving in the midplane between inﬁnitely wide conducting planes
at x =

of the bunch electric ﬁeld is described by [18]

where δ = x/h. Thus, on the surface, δ = 1, the ﬁeld is enhanced by a factor π/2 due to

4 Field Emission in HEP Colliders

In Section 2 the conditions were described under which FE starts to develop. Let us examine
in this section the performance of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the US Linear
Collider (USLC) [67], in an attempt to display their ”bottlenecks”.
In the following, we
shall not consider well established locations such as RF superconductive cavities, where
FE routinely occurs and leads to the rapid growth of power dissipation with ﬁeld. Our
consideration here is limited to locations where bunches are moving close to conducting
surfaces and create electric ﬁelds strong enough to activate observable FE eﬀects. For the
analysis we need to know the beam parameters, distances to the closest surfaces, their shapes,
and materials their constituent.

4.1 The LHC Collimator System

1011
Each of the two LHC rings will store 2808 bunches, each bunch populated with N = 1.15
protons at energies of up to 7 TeV (nominal design parameters). To handle the high inten-
sity LHC beams and the associated high loss rates of protons, a strongly acting collimator
system was designed and constructed [77]-[83]. The LHC collimators must restrict the me-
chanical aperture in the machine and clean the primary halo so that quenches of magnets
are avoided. To provide the required beam quality at the interaction points, primary and
secondary collimators must be physically close to the high intensity beams. This impose
strong limitations on the materials of the jaws and the length of the jaws. In the ”ﬁnal”
solution for the collimation system [83], [84], the collimators in IR3 and IR7 (and IR6) are
2 mm, at 7 TeV. Therefore,
made of graphite with parallel jaw surfaces and small gaps,

·

the ﬁrst candidate for a bottleneck is the very narrow collimator gap.

Diﬀerent scenarios for the beam parameters are foreseen in the LHC operation. These
parameters are listed in Table 1 [85]. For the nominal scenario, in accordance with (29), the
ﬁeld strength at a distance of 1 mm from a bunch is equal 69 KV/cm. At this ﬁeld level FEC
is negligible if calculated with use of the classical FN equation (4). However, the surface of a
jaw made of graphite may be polished only mechanically and the resulting surface roughness
is high (see Fig 2). The surface roughness and many other surface eﬀects as discussed in
Section 2 are characterized by the ﬁeld enhancement parameter βF N , whose actual value
needs to be determined by direct measurements. Thereby, the calculations of FEC presented
below are performed for a range of βF N values. The FEC density, JF N (βF N F, T ), calculated
for the graphite jaws with use of (29) and (12) at T =300 K, h=0.1 cm and ϕ=4.6 eV is shown
in Fig. 1. For βF N below 300 and the nominal scenario (LHC-n), the electron emission is
negligible. FEC for βF N in the range 300-500 begins to be notable and at higher βF N may
became a very serious problem. In the advanced scenarios (LHC-0/1), when bunches are
twice as short and their population is higher by the factor 1.48 (the ﬁeld level on the surface
increases by the factor 2.94), the emission current at βF N =200 increases by 14 orders of
magnitude ! At higher βF N , a very dense electron ﬂow will cause electrical breakdown in
vacuum, jaw surface heating and damage. The electron ﬂow could also disturb the proton
beam trajectory and give rise to loss of protons. The current density depicted in Fig. 1
can be translated into the number emitted electrons, Ne. A bunch with parameters from
σ∗ during the time τ = L/c will extract from both jaw
Table 1, expose the area δA = 2L
107J
surfaces Ne = 2δAτ J electrons. That gives Ne = 7.93
for LHC-0/1, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the evolution of Ne with βF N . We note that at
520 the number of extracted electrons Ne(LHC-n) is comparable with the number of
βF N ≈
protons per bunch.

The FE current rises not only with Fef f , but the number of active emitters also increases
with the ﬁeld. A local increase of the emission current causes Joule heating of the emission
tip which in turn leads to an increase of FEC. Fig. 3 illustrates the eﬀect.
It shows the
temperature dependent factor in (12), whose rise is limited by the conditions (14) and (15).
For a given ﬁeld strength and higher temperatures it is necessary to apply equations of the
thermo-ﬁeld-emission theory [5, 6].

Joule heating by FEC is not the only mechanism responsible for an abrupt increase of
FEC. Many studies point out that other mechanisms are also responsible for melting or
damage of the emitter, such as the bombardment of the surface by ions. These ions are
created by FEC as it passes through a cloud of gas evolving from the emission site [26, 27].
The plasma that develops can create an electric ﬁeld on the order of 107 V/cm at its interface
with the conducting wall and may result in an explosion of the emitter [28]-[31],[20].

In Section 2 we noted that the image potential states on the surface of solids are charac-
terized by low values of the work function, ϕ < 1 eV. If we hypothesize that the ﬁeld emission
due to IPS contributes in an important way to FEC, then the inner beam screen, consist-
ing of copper tubes lining the LHC vacuum chamber, is another candidate for a bottleneck.

Indeed, the proton beam is moving at a distance of
2 cm away from the beam screen wall

with n=1. These electrons escape the surface freely and this is reﬂected as a change in the
slope of the curve. In Fig 6 also shown calculations for the super-bunch scenario (see Table 1)
with the nominal work function for cooper, ϕ= 4.65 eV.

The results presented in Fig 6 are to some extent speculative. The calculations were
performed assuming that the density of IPS electrons, pumped by the soft component of the
synchrotron radiation from the bulk to the surface is of the same order as the density of
electrons at the Fermi level. Nevertheless they give rise to a cause for concern that FE from
the beam screen may amplify electron cloud formation.

4.2 The US Linear Collider

In the similar way we may evaluate the level of the ﬁeld emission in other colliders, for example
proposed US superconducting linear collider (USLC) [67] which can became a prototype of

a future international linear collider (ILC). The USLC will bring into collision electrons
and positrons at energy √s=500 GeV or, after an energy upgrade, 1000 GeV. The vacuum
chamber in the positron ring will be coated throughout with a material with low secondary
electron yield (e.g. conditioned titanium nitride, TiN) to prevent build-up of electron cloud.
The beam pipe has a circular internal cross-section, with radius h=21 mm. The vacuum
chambers are all constructed from an aluminum alloy. The bunch length is extraordinary
5 mm rms length of the bunches extracted
short. The bunch compressors must reduce the
from the damping rings to 300 µm bunch length required for the main linac and ﬁnal focus
systems. For optimum collider performance in the cold option, bunches with a charge of
1010 and a length of L = 300µm will be injected for acceleration in the main linac.
N = 2.0
For a beam well centered in the circular beam pipe, the image charge eﬀect is vanished
[68]. For this reason, instead of (29) we use in calculations equation (28). As a result, the
electric ﬁeld strength on an ideal smooth surface is characterized by the parameter N/hL.

denoting that with the same βF N and ϕ as for the LHC, the ﬁeld emission from the USLC
beam pipe surface will be stronger than in the LHC collimators. Fig. 7 shows the FE current
density predicted for a variety of ϕ values. The range of ϕ employed in the calculations reﬂects
uncertainties in the work function of TiN reported by diﬀerent authors [69]-[76]. There is an

observation [70], that changing the nitrogen concentration can modify the work function of
TiN. Furthermore, a thickness dependency of the work function was observed for TiN/Al [71].
For a TiN layer with thickness less than 20 angstroms, the TiN/Al gate work function is the
same as reported Al work-function (about 4.08 eV). For TiN layers of thickness greater than
100 angstroms, the TiN/Al gate work function is approximately the same as reported TiN
work-function (4.5 V). For TiN layers with thickness from 20 angstroms to 100 angstroms,
the work function can change as the TiN thickness is changed. The TiN crystal orientation is
important because the metal work function is strongly dependent on this quantity. According
to [72], (100) orientation TiN has ϕ
4.6 eV and 4.4 eV in the (111) orientation. The work
function of the TiN ﬁlm was found to be sensitive to the ﬁlm morphology, stipulated by a
sputtering technology and may be as low as 3.72 eV [73].

≃

In this way, the uncertainty in the value of ϕ gives rise to an uncertainty in the current

density of 3-5 orders of magnitude.

We ﬁnally point out that parameters of the positron and proton bunches and the beam
pipe geometry at the HERA collider are such that even at βF N = 103 the emission current
density is well below 10−17 A/cm2.

5 Electron Dynamics in the Bunch Fields

In this section we discuss in a semiquantitative way the fate of electrons after their emission
in the LHC collimator gap. Electrons leaves the surface with diﬀerent energies. The energy
spectra of electrons just ejected by the surface is presented in Fig 8. For a given imposed
ﬁeld, the width of the energy distribution grows with an increase of the surface temperature

vector, ~β(e) = ~v(e)/c, normal to the surface. The surface is placed parallel to the (0, y, z)
plane at a distance x = +h. The bunch is moving along the line (0,0,z) in the positive z
direction, as shown in Fig. 9. In the simple geometry chosen, we consider, only as an illus-
tration, the evolution of an electron trajectory in the (x, 0, z) plane; in this way components
of the self-ﬁeld vectors can be set ~F = (Fx, 0, 0) and ~B = (0, By, 0), where Fx is of the form

therefore below we omit superscripts in the electron velocity components. A partial solution

ment (34) causes an extremely high acceleration rate and a rapid increase of the electron
momentum. At the start time the instant curvature of the trajectory Ri is very small and
the energy loss Eγ through radiation can run up to 5% of the initial electron energy. At later
times with an increase in the distance from the surface, the energy loss by radiation is very
low, Eγ ∼

the electron carries the momentum of 4.13 GeV/c. Such an amount of energy is enough for
hadron production in an inelastic ep collision.

At the last stage, the electron is decelerated by the bunch ﬁeld. If the electron passes the
bunch without scattering, then at the moment when τ =0.254 it impacts the opposite plate
of the collimator at δ =-1 with a kinetic energy of 271 eV. For a fully symmetric conﬁguration
and neglecting the electron energy loss in the course of acceleration and deceleration, the
electron has to arrive at the opposite plate with the same kinetic energy as at the start point.
The energy diﬀerence arise due to an additional acceleration of the electron in the enhanced
ﬁeld at the tip apex and the assumption that at the end point the surface is ﬂat.

Above, we considered the emission of a single electron, when at τ =0 the emission point and
the bunch head had the same z-coordinate. However, the ﬁeld emission occurs throughout
the entire region L, covered by the ﬁeld of the bunch. Each electron reaches the bunch
center after time ∆τ
0.129. If now account a bunch movement, then electrons emitted at
1
2∆τ < τ < 1, will experience only initial acceleration or deceleration in the wake ﬁeld of
the bunch. Thus, the electron energy spectrum will be very broad, from 4.6 eV to 23 KeV.
As a result of emission from both collimator plates, the proton bunch occurs in the electron
streams being intersected. For high βF N it is necessary take into account the space charge
of electron clouds, whose electric ﬁeld reduces the the strength of the bunch ﬁeld and leads

≈

−

20

to a decrease of the electron emission. Nevertheless, the leading part of the bunch of length
∆τ will always remains out of the electron cloud and triggers the ﬁeld emission.

The interaction between the electron and the surface results in the ejection of secondary
electrons from the material. The secondary electrons consist of true secondaries and those
elastically reﬂected. The number of secondary electrons is given by the secondary emission
coeﬃcient (SEC) that depends on the surface characteristics and on the impact energy of the
primary. In turn, the secondaries are accelerated and, on impact, produce further generation
of electrons. The electron-cloud build-up is sensitive to the intensity, spacing, and length
of the proton bunches. The electron ﬂow increases exponentially if the number of emitted
electrons exceeds the number of impacting electrons, and if their trajectories satisfy some
speciﬁc conditions. For most materials the SEC exceeds unity for impact energies in a
range from a few tens of eV to a few thousand of eV. This type of electron multiplication,
so-called multipacting, and build-up a cloud of electrons has been studied recently very
intensively [91]-[104]. In the LHC arcs, as believed, the dominant source of electrons will be
photo-electrons from synchrotron radiation and beam-induced multipacting to be the leading
source of sustained electron-production.

The region near the scrapers and collimators is susceptible to a high beam-loss, and is
potentially another location of high electron concentration. Protons incident on the colli-
mator surfaces produce secondary electrons. Depending on the energy of the beam and the
incident angle, the secondary electron-to-proton yield can greatly exceed unity when the
incident beam is nearly parallel to the surface.

In conclusion let us note that any heterogeneous structures such as a grooved metal
surface [105, 106] introduced with intention to combat with the multiplication of electrons and
located near an intensive positively charged beam, may in real conditions actually provoke
ﬁeld emission.

6 Praemonitus Praemunitus

The analysis performed in the previous sections makes it possible to draw the conclusion
that in the addition to the known electron sources, electron ﬁeld emission intensiﬁed by
multipacting can make a dominant contribution to the build-up of an electron cloud in
the LHC collimator system and may become a serious problem. The analysis of the ILC
prototype reveals that a noticeable ﬁeld emission will accompany positron bunches on their
entire path during acceleration.

From the examples considered we learn that the level of ﬁeld emission is controlled by
two essential parameters. The ﬁrst of these, βF N , is wholly determined by the state of the
emitting surface and by the processes proceeding on it. Therefore, control of βF N is possible
only within certain limits. The eﬀect of surface aging will increase βF N with time. The actual
value of βF N for the graphite jaw can be obtained only by direct measurement.

For βF N below 300 and the nominal LHC-n scenario, the electron emission is negligible.
If the βF N value is in the range of 300-500, FEC begins to be notable. At higher βF N , FEC
may became a very serious problem. In the advanced scenarios (LHC-0/1), when bunches
are twice as short and their population is higher by a factor 1.48, the emission current at
βF N =200 increases by 14 orders of magnitude as compared with LHC-n. At higher βF N , a
very dense electron ﬂow will cause electrical breakdown in vacuum, jaw surface heating and
damage. The electron ﬂow could also disturb the proton beam trajectory and give rise to a
loss of protons.

The value of the second parameter, N/hL, is assigned by the beam parameters and the
distance to the conducting surface. It is possible and necessary to choose the components of

21

βF N N/hL in the way to minimize the electron ﬁeld emission.

Appendix: Electric Field of a Relativistic Dipole

Take two point charges, +q and -q, separated by a distance 2h. The charges are at rest in
frame ¯S and the ¯x-axis passes through the charges. We denote the coordinates of a point in
the frame ¯S by (¯x, ¯y, ¯z). Then the potential from the two charges (a dipole) is given by

ϕ(¯x, ¯y, ¯z) = κ

Abstract

We propose a technique for the production of attosecond X-ray pulses which is
based on the use of X-ray SASE FEL combined with a femtosecond laser system. A
few-cycle optical pulse from a Ti:sapphire laser interacts with the electron beam in
a two-period undulator resonant to 800 nm wavelength and produces energy modu-
lation within a slice of the electron bunch. Following the energy modulator the elec-
tron beam enters the X-ray undulator and produces SASE radiation. Due to energy
modulation the frequency is correlated to the longitudinal position within the few-
cycle-driven slice of SASE radiation pulse. The largest frequency oﬀset corresponds
to a single-spike pulse in the time domain which is conﬁned to one half-oscillation
period near the central peak electron energy. The selection of single-spike pulses is
achieved by using a crystal monochromator after the X-ray undulator. Our studies
show that the proposed technique is capable to produce 300 attoseconds long single
pulses with GW-level output power in the 0.1 nm wavelength range, and is appli-
cable to the European X-Ray Laser Project XFEL and the Linac Coherent Light
Source at SLAC.

1 Introduction

At the start of this century, we have seen a revolution in synchrotron radiation
source intensities. This revolution stemmed from the technique of free electron
laser (FEL) based on self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE), combined
with recent progress in accelerator technologies, developed in connection with
high-energy linear colliders. In 2001, the VUV FEL at the TESLA Test Facility
at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) has successfully demonstrated saturation from
82 nm to 125 nm with GW-level peak power and pulse duration down to 40 fs
[1,2]. It is the ﬁrst result from this device that Wabnitz et al. reported in [3].
They illuminated xenon clusters with high-intensity (1014 W/cm2) VUV FEL
pulses and observed an unexpectedly strong absorption of the VUV radiation.
Such a highly nonlinear optical interaction between light and matter at VUV
wavelength range has never been seen before and these fascinating results
show the potential of this new class of light sources for scientiﬁc research.
While modern third generation synchrotron light sources are reaching their
fundamental performance limit, recent successes in the development of the
VUV FEL at DESY have paved the way for the construction of the novel
type of light source which will combine most of the positive aspects of both a
laser and a synchrotron. Starting in 2004, the phase 2 extension of TTF will
deliver FEL radiation down to the soft X-ray spectral range with minimum
wavelength of about 6 nm in the ﬁrst harmonic and reaching into ”water
window” in the second harmonic [4].

Recently the German government, encouraged by these results, approved fund-
ing a hard X-ray SASE FEL user facility – the European X-Ray Laser Project
XFEL. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has given SLAC the goahead
for engineering design of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) device to
be constructed at SLAC. These devices should produce 100 fs X-ray pulses
with over 10 GW of peak power [5,6]. These new X-ray sources will be able to
produce intensities of the order of 1018 W/cm2. The main diﬀerence between
the two projects is the linear accelerator, an existing room temperature linac
for LCLS at SLAC, and a future superconducting linac for European XFEL.
The XFEL based on superconducting accelerator technology will make possi-
ble not only a jump in a peak brilliance by ten orders of magnitude, but also
an increase in average brilliance by ﬁve orders of magnitude compared to mod-
ern 3rd generation synchrotron radiation facilities. The LCLS and European
XFEL projects are scheduled to start operation in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

The motivation for the development of XFELs was recently described in de-
tail in [5,6]. The discussion in the scientiﬁc community over the past decade
has produced many ideas for novel applications of the X-ray laser. Brilliance,
coherence, and timing down to the femtosecond regime are the three prop-
erties which have the highest potential for new science to be explored with

1

an XFEL. In its initial conﬁguration the XFEL pulse duration is about 100
femtoseconds. Even though this is a few hundreds times shorter than in third
generation light sources, it can probably be further reduced to about 10 fem-
toseconds [7–9]. A novel way to generate sub-10 fs x-ray pulses – the slotted
spoiler method (P. Emma, 2003) has been proposed recently. This method is
based on spoiling the beam phase density in a part of the electron bunch so
that this part will not lase, while preserving lasing in a short length of the
bunch. The FEL performance of the spoiled beam approach was computed
using the time-dependent GENESIS simulation. It has been shown that it is
possible to produce X-ray pulses with duration of 3-4 fs FWHM for nominal
LCLS bunch compression parameters [10].

Femtosecond-resolution experiments with X-rays can possibly show directly
how matter is formed out of atoms. In fact, X-ray pulse duration even shorter
than one femtosecond may be useful for many scientiﬁc applications. The
reason is that phenomena inside atoms occur on sub-femtosecond timescale.
Generating single attosecond ∼ 0.1 nm X-ray pulses is one of the biggest
challenges in physics. The use of such a tool will enable to trace process inside
the atoms for the ﬁrst time. If there is any place where we have a chance to
test the main principles of quantum mechanics in the pure way, it is there.

The interest in the science with attosecond pulses is growing rapidly in the
very large laser community. This community is familiar with attosecond pulses
of light at photon energies up to about 0.5 keV (3 nm). This is achieved by
focusing a fs laser into a gas target creating radiation of high harmonics of
fundamental laser frequency. The key to these developments was the inven-
tion of laser systems delivering pulses in the range of 5 fs with pulse energies
higher than a fraction of mJ. This approach produced the ﬁrst measurable
XUV pulses in the 200 as regime [11,12]. In principle, table-top ultra-fast X-
ray sources have the right duration to provide us with a view of subatomic
transformation processes. However, their power and photon energy are by far
low. The XFEL is ideally suited the purpose of this emerging ﬁeld of science.
Recently an approach for the generation of attosecond pulses combining fs
quantum laser and harmonic cascade (HC) FEL scheme [13,14] was proposed
in [15]. The HC FEL scheme has the potential to produce coherent light down
to wavelengths of a few nm in an undulator sequence [16]. The analysis pre-
sented in [15] shows that this technique has potential to produce 100 as long
radiation pulses with MW-level of output power down to 1 nm wavelength.

The X-ray SASE FEL holds a great promise as a source of radiation for gener-
ating high power, single attosecond pulses. What ultimately limits the XFEL
pulse duration? Since the temporal and spectral characteristics of the radia-
tion ﬁeld are related to each other through Fourier transform, the bandwidth
of the XFEL and the pulse duration cannot vary independently of each other.
There is a minimum duration-bandwidth product (uncertainty principle). The

2

shortest possible X-ray pulse duration generated by XFEL is limited by the in-
trinsic bandwidth of the SASE process. In the case of the European XFEL and
the LCLS, the FWHM bandwidth near saturation (at 0.1 nm) is about 0.1%,
indicating a 300-as coherence time determined by the bandwidth product. Re-
cently a scheme to achieve pulse durations down to 400-600 attoseconds at a
wavelength of 0.1 nm has been proposed [17]. It uses a statistical properties
of SASE FEL high harmonic radiation. The selection of a single 10-GW level
attosecond pulses is achieved by using a special trigger in data acquisition
system. A promising scheme for attophysics experiments using this approach
has been studied and could be implemented in the XFEL design [18].

In this paper we propose a new method allowing to reduce the pulse length
of the X-ray SASE FEL to the shortest conceptual limit of about 300 as. It is
based on the application of a sub-10-fs laser for slice energy modulation of the
electron beam, and application of a crystal monochromator for the selection
of single attosecond pulses with GW-level output power.

2 The principle of attosecond techniques based on the use of XFEL

combined with fs quantum laser

A basic scheme of the attosecond X-ray source is shown in Fig. 1. An ultrashort
laser pulse is used to modulate the energy of electrons within the femtosecond
slice of the electron bunch at the seed laser frequency. The seed laser pulse
will be timed to overlap with the central area of the electron bunch. It serves
as a seed for a modulator which consists of a short (a few periods) undulator.
Following the energy modulator the beam enters the X-ray undulator. The
process of ampliﬁcation of radiation in this undulator develops in the same
way as in a conventional X-ray SASE FEL: ﬂuctuations of the electron beam
current serve as the input signal [19]. The proposed scheme for the genera-
tion of attosecond pulses is based on frequency-chirping the SASE radiation

Fig. 3. Sketch of two attosecond X-ray pulse sequence synthesation through fre-
quency chirping and spectral ﬁltering. Pulse separation is 2T0, where T0 is the

pulse. When an electron beam traverses an undulator, it emits radiation at
the resonance wavelength λ = λw(1 + K 2/2)/(2γ2). Here λw is the undulator
period, mc2γ is the electron beam energy, and K is the undulator parameter.
The laser-driven sinusoidal energy chirp produces a correlated frequency chirp
of the resonant radiation δω/ω ≃ 2δγ/γ. After the undulator, the radiation
is passed through a crystal monochromator which reﬂects a narrow band-
width. Since the radiation frequency is correlated to the longitudinal position
within the beam, a short temporal radiation pulse is transmitted through the
monochromator.

Recent technological advances in ultrafast optics have permitted the genera-
tion of optical pulses comprising only a few oscillation cycles of the electric

4

and magnetic ﬁelds. The pulses are delivered in a diﬀraction-limited beam
[20]. The combination of a X-ray SASE FEL and a few-cycle laser ﬁeld tech-
niques is very promising. Our concept of an attosecond X-ray facility is based
on the use of a few-cycle optical pulse from a Ti:sapphire laser system. This
optical pulse is used for the modulation of the energy of the electrons within
a slice of the electron bunch at a wavelength of 800 nm. Due to the extreme
temporal conﬁnement, moderate optical pulse energies of the order of a few
mJ can result in an electron energy modulation amplitude larger than 30-40
MeV. In few-cycle laser ﬁelds high intensities can be ”switched on” nonadi-
abatically within a few optical periods. As a result, a central peak electron
energy modulation is larger than other peaks. This relative energy diﬀerence
is used for the selection of SASE radiation pulses with a single spike in the
time domain by means of a crystal monochromator. A schematic, illustrating
these processes, is shown in Fig. 2. Many diﬀerent output ﬁelds can be realized
by using diﬀerent spectral windowing. For instance, it is possible to generate
a sequence of 300-as X-ray pulses, separated by T0 (or 2T0), where T0 is the
Ti:sapphire laser oscillation period. Such operation of the attosecond X-ray
source is illustrated in Fig. 3.

The discussion in this paper is focused on the parameters for the European
XFEL operating in the wavelength range around 0.1 nm [5]. Optimization of
the attosecond SASE FEL has been performed with the three-dimensional,
time dependent code FAST [21] taking into account all physical eﬀects inﬂu-
encing the SASE FEL operation (diﬀraction eﬀects, energy spread, emittance,
slippage eﬀect, etc.). In our scheme the separation of the frequency oﬀset
from the central frequency by a monochromator is used to distinguish the
300-as pulse from the 100 fs intense SASE pulse. The monochromatization is
straightforward: for the 0.1 nm wavelength range, Bragg diﬀraction is the main
tool used for such purposes. In this case, one has to take care that the short
pulse duration is preserved. Transmission through the monochromator will
produce some intrinsic spreading of the pulse, and the minimum pulse dura-
tion which may be selected by this method is limited by the uncertainty prin-
ciple. The number of possible reﬂections which provide the required spectral
width is rather limited. We are discussing here only Ge crystals, which have
the largest relative bandwidth. This is an important feature which ensures the
preservation of the single-spike pulse duration. In its simplest conﬁguration
the monochromator consists of Ge crystal diﬀracting from the (111) lattice
planes. We show that it is possible to produce X-ray pulses with FWHM du-
ration of 300 as. In some experimental situations this simplest conﬁguration
of monochromator is not optimal. In particular, our study has shown that the
maximum contrast of the attosecond X-ray pulses does not exceed 80% and
is due to the long tail of the intrinsic crystal reﬂectivity curve. The obvious
and technically possible solution of the problem of contrast increase might be
to use a premonochromator. One can align the premonochromator so that the
main peak of the spectrum is blocked.

3 Generation of attosecond pulses from XFEL

In the following we illustrate the operation of an attosecond SASE FEL for the
parameters close to those of the European XFEL operating at the wavelength
0.1 nm [5]. The parameters of the electron beam are: energy 15 GeV, charge
1 nC, rms pulse length 25 µm, rms normalized emittance 1.4 mm-mrad, rms
energy spread 1 MeV. Undulator period is 3.4 cm.

3.1 Slice modulation of the electron beam

The parameters of the seed laser are: wavelength 800 nm, energy in the laser
pulse 2–4 mJ, and FWHM pulse duration 5 fs (see Fig. 4). The laser beam is
focused onto the electron beam in a short undulator resonant at the optical
wavelength of 800 nm. Parameters of the undulator are: period length 50 cm,
peak ﬁeld 1.6 T, number of periods 2.

Optimal conditions of the focusing correspond to the positioning of the laser
beam waist in the center of the undulator. In laser pulses comprising just a
few wave cycles, the amplitude envelope and the carrier frequency are not
suﬃcient to characterize and control laser radiation, because the evolution of
the light ﬁeld is also inﬂuenced by a shift of the carrier wave with respect
to the pulse peak [20]. Recently, the generation of intense, few-cycle laser
pulses with a stable carrier envelope phase ϕ0 was demonstrated [22]. Let us
consider the principle question for the design of few-cycle pulse experiments:
how does the pulse phase behave during linear propagation? In order to answer

this question, we can calculate the evolution of few-cycle pulses in vacuum,
which is most conveniently described by a parabolic wave equation and by
starting from a Gaussian initial spatial pulse proﬁle [20]. Choosing the initial
pulse phase to be ϕ0 at the beam waist, one reveals that the carrier envelope
phase in the far ﬁeld ϕ(∞) = ϕ0 − π/2 undergoes a phase shift due to the
Guoy phase shift −π/2 [20]. Note that the Guoy phase shift and all the other
changes experienced by the pulse during propagation do not depend on the
initial phase ϕ0.

For an attosecond X-ray source it is of great interest to maximize the central
peak energy oﬀset, which depends sensitively on the absolute phase of the seed
laser pulse ϕ0. We start with an illustration of the few-cycle-driven energy
modulation assuming that the peak electric ﬁeld appears at the peak of the
envelope when the laser pulse passes the undulator center (i.e. ϕ0 = 0 at the
Gaussian beam waist). The interaction with the laser light in the undulator
then produces a time dependent electron energy modulation as shown in Fig. 5.
For the laser (FWHM) pulse duration of 5 fs at a laser pulse energy 2-4 mJ,
we expect a central peak energy modulation 30-40 MeV.

3.2 Monochromator

The width of the spectral distribution of the SASE radiation will be deter-
mined by the frequency chirp, provided the frequency chirp is larger than FEL
bandwidth. A monochromator may be used to select the pulses of short du-
ration, due to correlation between frequency and longitudinal position in the
radiation pulse. For 12 keV photons, we consider Bragg diﬀraction in crystals

 

7

as a method of bandwidth selection. Special attention is called to the fact
that the relative spectral width for the given Bragg reﬂection is independent
of the wavelength or glancing angle of X-rays and is given merely by proper-
ties of the crystal and the reﬂecting atomic planes. In particular, it implies
that the choice of a crystal and reﬂecting atomic planes determines the spec-
tral resolution. For example, one can consider Si(111) crystals, which have a
FWHM bandwidth of ∆λ/λ = 1.3 × 10−4, or Ge(111)crystals, which have a
FWHM bandwidth of ∆λ/λ = 3.4 × 10−4. Monochromators at synchrotron
beam lines are most commonly fabricated from silicon. The reason is that the
semiconductor industry has created a huge demand for defect-free , perfect
single crystals. Silicon is by no means the only choice, and in recent years
diamond has become a popular alternative, due to the fact it has the highest
thermal conductivity and low absorption.

An attosecond X-ray source requires a relatively broadband monochromator.
The larger the monochromator bandwidth is, the shorter the minimal pulse
duration than can be extracted. We are discussing here only Germanium sin-
gle crystals which have the largest relative bandwidth. Although Ge is not as
perfect as silicon or diamond, suﬃciently large perfect Ge crystals are avail-
able today. For 12 keV photons Bragg peaks of Ge crystals have reﬂectivities
of approximately 75%. Figure 6 gives an example of a reﬂectivity curve for a
thick absorbing crystal. The drawing of Fig. 6 shows several interesting fea-
tures. The shape is asymmetric and is due to absorption eﬀect. The tails of
the reﬂectivity curve decrease as (∆λ/λ)−2. It should be pointed out that the
tail of reﬂectivity curve plays important role in the operation of the attosec-
ond X-ray source, and this characteristic of spectral window and attosecond
pulse contrast are ultimately connected. Good crystal quality is required for

high resolving power. Similarly, a good resolving power requires a collimated
beam. In fact, the angular spread of an insuﬃciently collimated beam neg-
atively aﬀects the wavelength resolution just like poor crystal quality. The
Ge monochromator angular acceptance is of order 50 µrad for a wavelength
0.1 nm, and is well matched to the natural opening angle, (1 µrad), of an
XFEL source. Therefore, a crystal monochromator works better with XFEL
radiation than with conventional synchrotron source.

Besides the crystal quality, other factors must be considered in selecting a
scheme for a monochromator. The monochromator crystal must be thermally
stable and capable of being exposed to XFEL output radiation with limited
radiation damage. We have chosen the one Ge (111) crystal scheme of the
X-ray monochromator with silicon premonochromator, which withdraws the
major heat load from the actual short pulse selection Ge monochromator. We
consider Laue diﬀraction in Si crystals as a method of bandwidth selection in
premonochromator. In the pre-monochromator part one can use ten Si crystal
plates of 15µm thickness and the reﬂection Si(111). Given the crystal plate is
perfect, it reﬂects 90% of the incident X-rays within a band of ∆λ/λ ≃ 10−4.
One can align the Si plates so that the main peak of the spectrum is blocked.
The radiation power which reaches the broadband (Ge) monochromator crys-
tal is 10% of the initial value. Only 30% of the oﬀset frequency radiation
is absorbed in (15 × 10 = 150µm thickness) premonochromator totally, and
the rest passes through. Another advantage of the premonochromator is the
possibility to increase the contrast of output attosecond X-ray pulses.

3.3 Output characteristics of attosecond FEL

A complete description of the X-ray FEL can be performed only with three-
dimensional, time-dependent numerical simulation code. Since ampliﬁcation
process starts from shot noise, properties of a single-spike selection should
be described in statistical term. The statistics of concern are deﬁned over an
ensemble of radiation pulses.

In the present scheme an electron beam with slice modulation of the energy
passes through the undulator and produces SASE radiation. Since only a small
fraction of the bunch is modulated (10 fs versus 200 fs of FWHM electron
pulse duration, see Fig.5), the total energy in the radiation pulse remains
approximately the same as in the case of nonmodulated electron beam (see
Fig. 7), and saturation is achieved at an undulator length of about 120 m.
Figure 8 shows typical temporal and spectral structure of the radiation pulse
at saturation. In the present numerical example the central part of the electron
bunch was subjected to the slice energy modulation, and one can notice its
clear signature in the temporal structure. Figure 9 shows an enlarged view of

Fig. 7. Average energy in the radiation pulse versus undulator length

the central part of the radiation pulse. The dotted lines in this ﬁgure show
the initial energy modulation of the electron beam. The temporal structure
of the radiation pulse has a clear physical explanation. The FEL process is
strongly suppressed in the regions of the electron bunch with large energy
chirp, and only regions of the electron bunch with nearly zero energy chirp
produce radiation. From a physical point of view each part of the bunch near
the local extremum of the energy modulation can be considered as an isolated
electron bunch of short duration. At the chosen parameters of the system its
duration is about 300 attosecond which is about of coherence time. Thus, it
is not surprising that only a single radiation spike is produced by each area
near the local extremum. An asymmetry of averaged power (at symmetric
energy modulation) is due to the nonsymmetry of the FEL process with respect
to the sign and the value of the energy chirp. In particular, spikes related
to the negative of energy oﬀset have a higher amplitude. This is a typical
nonlinear eﬀect allowing to prolong interaction of the radiation pulse with
the electron pulse at the ”correct” sign of the energy chirp. The temporal
structure of the radiation pulse nearly repeats the temporal structure of the
energy modulation. Slight deviations from the periodic structure are also due
to the nonsymmetry of the FEL process with respect to the sign of the energy
chirp. In particular, spikes related to the negative energy oﬀset slip more
forward than those related to the positive energy oﬀset.

Let us turn back to the main subject of our study, i.e. to the production of
attosecond pulses. The lower plot in Fig. 8 shows the total radiation spectrum
of the radiation pulse. At this scale a signature of the slice energy modula-
tion can hardly be seen. In Fig: 10 we present the tails of the spectrum at an
enlarged scale. Each of three clearly visible bumps in the averaged spectrum
corresponds to a local extremum of the energy oﬀset shown in Fig. 5. The

spectrum allows us to select single pulse, or a two pulse sequence of attosec-
ond duration. The calculation involves the following steps. The FEL simulation
code produces 3-D arrays for the radiation ﬁeld in the near zone. This ﬁeld
is recalculated into the far ﬁeld zone, and is subjected to the Fourier trans-
form. The latter result is convoluted with the reﬂectivity function of Ge(111)
monochromator (see Fig. 6), and is subjected to inverse Fourier transform
giving temporal structure of the radiation pulse behind the monochromator.

300 as, the average power has GW-level, and the radiation pulse energy is
about a µJ. The larger width of the averaged curve is partially due to shot-
to-shot ﬂuctuations of the position of the radiation pulse (a fraction of coher-
ence time). Note that shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations of the radiation energy after
monochromator are suppressed signiﬁcantly due to ultrashort duration of the

oﬀset from the resonant frequency.

By positioning of the monochromator central frequency to the spectrum bumps
M2 or M3 one can select a two pulse sequence as illustrated in Figs. 12 and
13. Two pulses are separated by two or one oscillation period of optical laser
depending on the choice of the monochromator tuning. Note that due to the
statistical nature of the SASE process the time jitter between two pulses is

cillation period (see Fig. 12). As mentioned above, this is a typical nonlinear
eﬀect related to the sensitivity of the FEL process to the sign and the value
of the energy chirp. Although the energy modulation amplitude is the same
in both maxima, the shape of the energy chirp is asymmetric.

4 Discussion

Successful operation of the attosecond XFEL requires the fulﬁllment of sev-
eral requirements. The requirement that the SASE FEL bandwidth is much
less than the separation of the few-cycle-driven frequency oﬀset is of critical
importance for the performance of the attosecond XFEL. In this case a crys-
tal monochromator can be used to distinguish the attosecond pulses from the
intense SASE pulses. Obviously, this requirement is easier to achieve for high

power optical laser systems. For 800 nm laser radiation and for 0.1 nm output
radiation, for example, the peak power of few-cycle laser pulse must be larger
than 500-700 GW. This condition can be satisﬁed by a terawatt-scale sub-10
fs Ti:sapphire laser system which seems feasible.

Our scheme of attosecond X-ray source is based on the assumption that the
beam density modulation does not appreciably change as the beam propagates
through the energy modulator undulator. When the resonance condition takes
place, the electrons with diﬀerent arrival phases acquire diﬀerent values of the
energy increments (positive or negative), which result in the modulation of
the longitudinal velocity of the electrons with the laser frequency. Since the
velocity modulation is transformed into a density modulation of the electron
beam when, passing the undulator, an additional wakeﬁeld exists because
of a variation in amplitude density modulation. It is interesting to estimate
the amount of bunching produced during the 800 nm undulator pass. An
undulator is a sequence of bending magnets where particles with diﬀerent
energies have diﬀerent path length, ∆z = R56δE/E. The net compaction
factor of the undulator is given by R56 = 2λ0Nw, where λ0 = 800 nm is
the resonance wavelength and Nw = 2 is the number of undulator periods.
An induced correlated energy spread at the exit of (800 nm) undulator is
about 0.3%. Therefore, a rough estimate for the induced bunching is δa ≃
(πR56/λ0)(δE/E) ≃ 3 × 10−2. Since this value is much less than unity, we can
conclude that density modulation in the 800 nm undulator due to few-cycle-
driven energy spread should not be a serious limitation in our case.

The next problem is that of synchronization. Frequency chirp in the XFEL
is seeded by positioning a fs optical pulse on the electron bunch. Even when
femtosecond pulses from laser system are synchronized to the photoinjector
master clock with phase-locking technique, the synchronization of the optical
seed laser with the electron pulses to an accuracy of 100 fs is not yet achievable.
A more serious problem is the timing jitter of electron and seed laser pulses.
The jitter of electron pulses originates in the photoinjector laser system (laser
pulse jitter) and in the magnetic bunch compressors (from electron bunch
energy jitter). Due to this uncertainty, not every fs optical pulse will produce
an attosecond X-ray pulse. Random production of attosecond X-ray pulses
needs to be controlled. A basic question at this point is how attosecond X-
ray pulses will be identiﬁed. Separation of attosecond pulse frequency from
the central frequency can be used to distinguish the 300 as pulses from the
intense 100 fs pulses. Appearing of X-ray pulses at the frequency oﬀset will
indicate that the seed optical pulse is overlapped with the central part of the
electron bunch.

Analysis of parameters of an attosecond X-ray source shows that its repetition
rate is clearly limited by the value of repetition rate achievable with terawatt-
scale sub-10 fs Ti:sapphire laser system having 1-kHz repetition rate [22].

17

The single-pass scheme considered here is the simplest one. The laser beam,
which is essentially unaltered in the electron beam modulation process, is
then disposed of. This is not optimum for a couple of reasons. The idea is
roughly the following. The attosecond pulse repetition rate can be signiﬁcantly
increased if the laser pulse can be reused, because the laser pulse suﬀers little
loss in energy after each interaction with electron beam. The solution of this
problem is a multipass approach (based on reﬂective optical elements) in which
a laser pulse is made to pass through the modulator undulator a ﬁnite number
of times before being thrown away. In this way, the attosecond pulse repetition
rate is increased by increasing the number of laser pulses used.

5 Conclusion

Operation of the proposed scheme was illustrated for the parameters of the
European XFEL. Although the present work is concerned primarily for use in
the wavelength range around 0.1 nm, its applicability is not restricted to this
range, for example 0.15 nm LCLS facility is a suitable candidate for applica-
tion of attosecond techniques described here. It is important that proposed
attosecond scheme is based on the nominal XFEL parameters, and operates
in a ”parasitic” mode not interfering with the main mode of the XFEL opera-
tion. It can be realized with minimum additional eﬀorts. The machine design
should foresee the space for installation of modulator undulator and a view-
port for input optical system. Many of the components of the required laser
system can be achieved with technology which is currently being developed
for applications other than the attosecond X-ray source. As a result, a laser
system could be developed over the next few years and can meet the XFEL
requirements well in advance of XFEL construction schedule.

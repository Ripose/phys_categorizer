Abstract

We present the application of variational-wavelet anal-
ysis to numerical/analytical calculations of Wigner func-
tions in (nonlinear) quasiclassical beam dynamics prob-
lems.
(Naive) deformation quantization and multiresolu-
tion representations are the key points. We construct the
representation via multiscale expansions in generalized co-
herent states or high-localized nonlinear eigenmodes in the
base of compactly supported wavelets and wavelet packets.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new
numerical-analytical technique based on local nonlinear
harmonic analysis (wavelet analysis, generalized coher-
ent states analysis) to quantum/quasiclassical (nonlinear)
beam/accelerator physics calculations. The reason for this
treatment is that recently a number of problems appeared
in which one needs take into account quantum properties
of particles/beams. Our starting point is the general point
of view of deformation quantization approach at least on
naive Moyal/Weyl/Wigner level [1], [2].

The main point is that the algebras of quantum observ-
ables are the deformations of commutative algebras of clas-
sical observables (functions) [1]. So, if we have the Poisson
manifold M (symplectic manifolds, Lie coalgebras, etc) as
a model for classical dynamics then for quantum calcula-
tions we need to ﬁnd an associative (but non-commutative)
star product ∗ on the space of formal power series in ¯h with
coefﬁcients in the space of smooth functions on M such
that

f ∗ g = f g + ¯h{f, g} +

¯hnBn(f, g),

(1)

Xn≥2

where {f, g} is the Poisson brackets, Bn are bidifferential
operators. Kontsevich gave the solution to this deforma-
tion problem in terms of formal power series via sum over
graphs and proved that for every Poisson manifold M there
is a canonically deﬁned gauge equivalence class of star-
products on M. Also there are nonperturbative corrections
to power series representation for ∗ [1]. In naive calcula-
tions we may use simple formal rule:

In this paper we consider calculations of Wigner functions
(WF) as the solution of Wigner equations [2] (part 2):

and especially stationary Wigner equations. Our approach
is based on extension of our variational-wavelet approach
[3]-[14]. Wavelet analysis is some set of mathematical
methods, which gives us the possibility to work with well-
localized bases in functional spaces and gives maximum
sparse forms for the general type of operators (differential,
integral, pseudodifferential) in such bases. These bases
are natural generalization of standard coherent, squeezed,
thermal squeezed states [2], which correspond to quadrat-
ical systems (pure linear dynamics) with Gaussian Wigner
functions. So, we try to calculate quantum corrections
to classical dynamics described by polynomial nonlinear
Hamiltonians such as orbital motion in storage rings, or-
bital dynamics in general multipolar ﬁelds etc. from papers
[3]-[14]. The common point for classical/quantum calcula-
tions is that any solution, which comes from full multireso-
lution expansion in all space/time (or phase space) scales, is
represented via expansion into a slow part and fast oscillat-
ing parts (part 3). So, we may move from the coarse scales
of resolution to the ﬁnest one to obtain more detailed in-
formation about our dynamical classical/quantum process.
In this way we give contribution to our full solution from
each scale of resolution. The same is correct for contribu-
tions to power spectral density (energy spectrum): we can
take into account contributions from each level/scale of res-
olution. Because afﬁne group of translations and dilations
(or more general group, which acts on the space of solu-
tions) is inside the approach (in wavelet case), this method
resembles the action of a microscope. We have contribution
to ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution from the whole
underlying inﬁnite scale of spaces. In part 4 we consider
numerical modelling of Wigner functions, which explicitly
demonstrates quantum interference of generalized coherent
states.

2 WIGNER EQUATIONS

According to Weyl transform, quantum state (wave func-
tion or density operator) corresponds to Wigner function,
which is the analog of classical phase-space distribution
[2]. We consider the following form of differential equa-
tions for time-dependent WF, W = W (p, q, t):

Wt =

Let

ˆρ = |Ψǫ >< Ψǫ|

be the density operator or projection operator correspond-
ing to the energy eigenstate |Ψǫ > with energy eigenvalue
ǫ. Then time-independent Schroedinger equation corre-
sponding to Hamiltonian

So, we have exactly dN 2 algebraical equations for dN 2
unknowns ars. But in the case of equations for WF (7) we
have overdetermined system of equations: 2N 2 equations
for N 2 unknowns ars (in this case d = 1). In this paper we
consider non-standard method for resolving this problem,
which is based on biorthogonal wavelet expansion. So, in-
stead of expansion (9) we consider the following one:

ˆH(ˆp, ˆq) =

+ U (ˆq),

ˆp2
2m

where U (ˆq) is an arbitrary polynomial function (related
beam dynamics models considered in [3]-[14]) on ˆq, is [2]:

ˆH ˆρ = ǫˆρ

After Weyl-Wigner mapping we get the following equation
on WF in c-numbers:

After expanding the potential U into the Taylor series we
have two real partial differential equations. In the next sec-
tion we consider variation-wavelet approach for the solu-
tion of these equations for the case of an arbitrary polyno-
mial U (q), which corresponds to a ﬁnite number of terms
in equations (7) up to any ﬁnite order of ¯h.

3 VARIATIONAL MULTISCALE

REPRESENTATION

Let L be an arbitrary (non)linear differential operator
with matrix dimension d, which acts on some set of func-
tions Ψ ≡ Ψ(x, y) =
x, y ∈
Ω ⊂ R2 from L2(Ω):

Ψ1(x, y), . . . , Ψd(x, y)
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

,

LΨ ≡ L(Q, x, y)Ψ(x, y) = 0,

(8)

where Q ≡ Q(x, y, ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y).

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for so-
lution as the following ansatz (in the same way we may
consider different ansatzes):

ΨN (x, y) =

arsΨr(x)Φs(y)

(9)

N

Xr,s=1

We shall determine the coefﬁcients of expansion from the
following variational conditions (different related varia-
tional approaches are considered in [3]-[14]):

kℓ ≡

(LΨN )Ψk(x)Φℓ(y)dxdy = 0

Because wavelet functions are the generalization of co-
herent states we consider an expansion on this overcom-
plete set of basis wavelet functions as a generalization of
standard coherent states expansion. So, variational ap-
proach reduced the initial problem (8) to the problem of
solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some
algebraical problems at the second stage.

We consider the multiresolution expansion as the second
main part of our construction. We have contribution to ﬁnal
result from each scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite
scale of increasing closed subspaces Vj:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

The solution is parametrized by solutions of two re-
duced algebraical problems, one is linear or nonlinear (10)
(depends on the structure of operator L) and the others
are some linear problems related to computation of coefﬁ-
cients of algebraic equations (10). These coefﬁcients can
be found by some wavelet methods. We use compactly
supported wavelet basis functions for expansions (9). We
may consider different types of wavelets including general
wavelet packets.

Now we concentrate on the last additional problem, that
comes from overdeterminity of equations (7), which de-
mands to consider biorthogonal wavelet expansions.
It
leads to equal number of equations and unknowns in re-
duced algebraical system of equations (10). We start with
two hierarchical sequences of approximations spaces:

. . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . . ,

. . .

V−2 ⊂

V−1 ⊂

V0 ⊂

V1 ⊂

V2 . . . ,

e

and as usually, W0 is complement to V0 in V1, but now
e
not necessarily orthogonal complement. Functions ϕ, ˜ϕ
generate a multiresolution analysis. ϕ(x − k), ψ(x − k)
are synthesis functions, ˜ϕ(x − ℓ), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) are analysis
functions. Synthesis functions are biorthogonal to analysis
functions. Scaling spaces are orthogonal to dual wavelet
spaces. Biorthogonal point of view is more ﬂexible and
stable under the action of large class of operators while or-
thogonal (one scale for multiresolution) is fragile, all com-
putations are much more simple and we accelerate the rate
of convergence of our expansions (9). By analogous an-
zatzes and approaches we may construct also the multi-
scale/multiresolution representations for solution of time
dependent Wigner equation (4) [14].

4 NUMERICAL MODELLING

So, our constructions give us the following N-mode rep-

resentation for solution of Wigner equations (7):

W N (p, q) =

arsΨr(p)Φs(q)

(11)

N

Xr,s=1

where Ψr(p), Φs(q) may be represented by some fam-
ily of (nonlinear) eigenmodes with the corresponding mul-
tiresolution/multiscale representation in the high-localized
wavelet bases:

Ψk(p) = ΨM1

k,slow(p) +

Φk(q) = ΦM2

k,slow(q) +

Our (nonlinear) eigenmodes are more realistic for the mod-
elling of nonlinear classical/quantum dynamical process
than the corresponding linear gaussian-like coherent states.
Here we mention only the best convergence properties of
expansions based on wavelet packets, which realize the
so called minimal Shannon entropy property. On Fig. 1
we present the numerical modelling [15] of Wigner func-
tion for a simple model of beam motion, which explicitly

demonstrates quantum interference property. On Fig. 2 we
present the multiscale/multiresolution representation (11)
for solution of Wigner equation.

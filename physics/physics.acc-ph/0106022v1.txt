Abstract

We present the applications of wavelet analysis meth-
ods in constrained variational framework to calculation of
dynamical aperture. We construct represention via exact
nonlinear high-localized periodic eigenmodes expansions,
which allows to control contribution to motion from each
scale of underlying multiscale structure and consider qual-
itative approach to the problem.

INTRODUCTION

The estimation of dynamic aperture of accelerator is real
and long standing problem. From the formal point of view
the aperture is a some border between two types of dynam-
ics: relative regular and predictable motion along of ac-
ceptable orbits or ﬂuxes of orbits corresponding to KAM
tori and stochastic motion with particle losses blown away
by Arnold diffusion and/or chaotic motions. According to
standard point of view this transition is being done by some
analogues with map technique [1]. Consideration for aper-
ture of n-pole Hamiltonians with kicks

The goal of this paper is is two-fold. In part 2 we con-
sider some qualitative criterion which is based on more
realistic understanding of difference between motion in
KAM regions and stochastic regions: motion in KAM re-
gions may be described only by regular functions (with-
out rich internal structures) but motion in stochastic re-
gions/layers may be described by functions with internal

self-similar structures, i.e. fractal type functions. Wavelet
analysis approach [2], [3] provides us with more or less
analytical description based on calculations of wavelet co-
efﬁcients/wavelet transform asymptotics. In part 3 we con-
sider the same problem on a more quantitative level as con-
strained variational problem and give explicit representa-
tion for all dynamical variables as expansions in nonlinear
periodic high-localized eigenmodes.

2 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS

Fractal or chaotic image is a function (distribution),
which has structure at all underlying scales. So, such ob-
jects have additional nontrivial details on any level of res-
olution. But such objects cannot be represented by smooth
functions, because they resemble constants at small scales
[2], [3]. So, we need to ﬁnd self-similarity behaviour dur-
ing movement to small scales for functions describing non-
regular motion. So, if we look on a “fractal” function f
(e.g. Weierstrass function) near an arbitrary point at differ-
ent scales, we ﬁnd the same function up to a scaling fac-
tor. Consider the ﬂuctuations of such function f near some
point x0

floc(x) = f (x0 + x)

f (x0)

−

fx0(λx)

λα(x0)fx0(x)

where α(x0) is the local scaling exponent or H¨older expo-
nent of the function f at x0.

According to [3] general functional spaces and scales of
spaces can be characterized through wavelet coefﬁcients
or wavelet transforms. Let us consider continuous wavelet

So, if H¨older exponent of (distribution) f (x) around the
(n, n + 1), then we have the
point x = x0 is h(x0)

following behaviour of f (x) around x = x0: f (x) = c0 +

at least in point x0, then Wg(f )(x0, a)
This shows that localization of the wavelet coefﬁcients at
small scale is linked to local regularity. As a rule, the faster
the wavelet coefﬁcients decay, the more the analyzed func-
tion is regular. So,transition from regular motion to chaotic
one may be characterised as the changing of H¨older ex-
ponent of function, which describes motion. This gives
criterion of appearance of fractal behaviour and may de-
termine,at least in principle, dynamic aperture.

3 CONSTRAINED PROBLEM FOR

QUASI-PERIODIC ORBITS

We consider extension of our approach [4]-[15] to the
case of constrained quasi-periodic trajectories. The equa-
tions of motion corresponding to Hamiltonian (1) may be
formulated as a particular case of the general system of or-
dinary differential equations dxi/ds = fi(xj , s), (i, j =
1, ..., 2n), where fi are not more than rational functions of
dynamical variables xj and have arbitrary dependence of
time but with periodic boundary conditions. Let us con-
sider this system as an operator equation for operator S,
which satisﬁes the equation

S(H, x, ∂/∂s, ∂/∂x, s) = 0

(7)

which is polynomial/rational in x = (x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . ,
pn) and have arbitrary dependence on s and operator C(H,
x, ∂/∂t, ∂/∂x, s), which is an operator describing some
constraints as differential as integral on the set of dynam-
ical variables. E.g., we may ﬁx a part of non-destroying
integrals of motion (e.g., energy) or areas in phase space
(ﬂuxes of orbits). So, we may consider our problem as
constructing orbits described by Hamiltonian (1). In this
way we may ﬁx a given acceptable aperture or vice versa
by feedback via parametrisation of orbits by coefﬁcients of
initial dynamical problem we may control different levels
of aperture as a function of the parameters of the system (1)
under consideration. As a result our variational problem is
formulated for pair of operators (C, S) on extended set of
dynamical variables which includes Lagrangian multipliers
λ.

Then we use (weak) variation formulation

< (S + λC)x, y > dt = 0

and the corresponding expansions:

As a result we have from (7) the following reduced system
of algebraical equations (RSAE) on the set of unknown co-
efﬁcients ai of expansions (10):

L(Sij, Ckl, a, Λ) = 0

(11)

where operator L is algebraization of initial problem (7)
and we need to ﬁnd in general situation objects Λ.

We consider the procedure of their calculations in case of

2j and as consequence our multiresolution

We would like to thank The U.S. Civilian Research
& Development Foundation (CRDF) for support (Grants
TGP-454, 455), which gave us the possibility to present
our nine papers during PAC2001 Conference in Chicago
and Ms. Camille de Walder from CRDF for her help and
encouragement.

So, this problem is the standard linear algebraical problem.
Then, we may solve RSAE (11) and determine unknown
coefﬁcients from formal expansion (10) and therefore to
obtain the solution of our initial problem. It should be noted
that if we consider only truncated expansion with N terms
then we have from (11) the system of N
2n algebraical
equations and the degree of this algebraical system coin-
cides with the degree of initial differential system. As a
result we obtained the following explicit representation for
periodic trajectories in the base of periodized (period Ti)
wavelets (10):

Because afﬁne group of translation and dilations is inside
the approach, this method resembles the action of a mi-

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion
in all time scales. Formula (19) gives us expansion into a
slow part xslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N.
So, we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the
ﬁnest one for obtaining more detailed information about
our dynamical process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of equa-
tion (19) corresponds on the global level of function space
decomposition to resolution space and the second one to
detail space. In this way we give contribution to our full
solution from each scale of resolution or each time scale.

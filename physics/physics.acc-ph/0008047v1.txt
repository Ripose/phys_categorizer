SPIN-ORBITAL MOTION: SYMMETRY AND DYNAMICS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, V.O. Bolshoj pr., 61, 199178, Russia ∗†

Abstract
We present the applications of variational–wavelet ap-
proach to nonlinear (rational) model for spin-orbital mo-
tion: orbital dynamics and Thomas-BMT equations for
classical spin vector. We represent the solution of this dy-
namical system in framework of periodical wavelets via
variational approach and multiresolution.

1

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new numeri-
cal-analytical technique which is based on the methods of
local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the
spin orbital motion. Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel
set of mathematical methods, which gives us a possibil-
ity to work with well-localized bases in functional spaces
and give for the general type of operators (differential, inte-
gral, pseudodifferential) in such bases the maximum sparse
forms. Our approach in this paper is based on the general-
ization of variational-wavelet approach from [1]-[8], which
allows us to consider not only polynomial but rational type
of nonlinearities [9]. The solution has the following form

z(t) = zslow

N (t) + Xj≥N

zj(ωjt), ωj ∼ 2j

(1)

N

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all time scales. Formula (1) gives us expansion into a slow
part zslow
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N. So, we
may move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynami-
cal process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of equation (1) corre-
sponds on the global level of function space decomposition
to resolution space and the second one to detail space. In
this way we give contribution to our full solution from each
scale of resolution or each time scale. The same is correct
for the contribution to power spectral density (energy spec-
trum): we can take into account contributions from each
level/scale of resolution.

In part 2 we consider spin-orbital motion. In part 3 start-
ing from variational formulation we construct via multires-
olution analysis explicit representation for all dynamical
variables in the base of compactly supported periodized
wavelets. In part 4 we consider results of numerical cal-
culations.

2 SPIN-ORBITAL MOTION

Let us consider the system of equations for orbital motion
and Thomas-BMT equation for classical spin vector [10]:

We will consider this dynamical system in [11] via invari-
ant approach, based on consideration of Lie-Poison struc-
tures on semidirect products. But from the point of view
which we used in [9] we may consider the similar approx-
imations and then we also arrive to some type of polyno-
mial/rational dynamics.

3 VARIATIONAL WAVELET APPROACH

FOR PERIODIC TRAJECTORIES

We start with extension of our approach to the case of peri-
odic trajectories. The equations of motion corresponding
to our problems may be formulated as a particular case
of the general system of ordinary differential equations
dxi/dt = fi(xj, t), (i, j = 1, ..., n), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, where
fi are not more than rational functions of dynamical vari-
ables xj and have arbitrary dependence of time but with
periodic boundary conditions. According to our variational
approach we have the solution in the following form

xi(t) = xi(0) +Xk

λk
i ϕk(t),

xi(0) = xi(1),

(5)

where λk
i are the roots of reduced algebraical systems of
equations with the same degree of nonlinearity and ϕk(t)
corresponds to useful type of wavelet bases (frames).
It
should be noted that coefﬁcients of reduced algebraical sys-
tem are the solutions of additional linear problem and also
depend on particular type of wavelet construction and type
of bases.

Our constructions are based on multiresolution appro-
ach. Because afﬁne group of translation and dilations is
inside the approach, this method resembles the action of
a microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from
each scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of
spaces. More exactly, the closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) cor-
responds to level j of resolution, or to scale j. We consider
a r-regular multiresolution analysis of L2(Rn) (of course,
we may consider any different functional space) which is a
sequence of increasing closed subspaces Vj:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

(6)

Then just as Vj is spanned by dilation and translations of
the scaling function, so Wj are spanned by translations and
dilation of the mother wavelet ψjk(x), where
ψjk(x) = 2j/2ψ(2jx − k).

(7)

All expansions, which we used, are based on the following
properties:

L2(R) = V0

Mj=0

We need also to ﬁnd in general situation objects

but now in the case of periodic boundary conditions. Now
we consider the procedure of their calculations in case
of periodic boundary conditions in the base of periodic
wavelet functions on the interval [0,1] and corresponding
expansion (1) inside our variational approach. Periodiza-
tion procedure gives us

ˆϕj,k(x) ≡ Xℓ∈Z
ˆψj,k(x) = Xℓ∈Z

ϕj,k(x − ℓ)

ψj,k(x − ℓ)

(10)

So, ˆϕ, ˆψ are periodic functions on the interval [0,1]. Be-
cause ϕj,k = ϕj,k′ if k = k′mod(2j), we may consider
only 0 ≤ k ≤ 2j and as consequence our multiresolution
ˆVj = L2[0, 1] with ˆVj = span{ ˆϕj,k}2j−1
has the form [j≥0
[12].
Integration by parts and periodicity gives useful
relations between objects (9) in particular quadratic case
(d = d1 + d2):

k=0

k1,k2 = (−1)d1Λ0,d2+d1
Λd1,d2
k1,k2 = Λ0,d
Λ0,d
0,k2−k1 ≡ Λd

k1,k2

k2−k1

,

(11)

So, any 2-tuple can be represented by Λd
k. Then our sec-
ond additional linear problem is reduced to the eigenvalue
problem for {Λd
k}0≤k≤2j by creating a system of 2j ho-
mogeneous relations in Λd
k and inhomogeneous equations.

So, we reduced our last problem to standard linear alge-
braical problem. Then we use the methods from [9]. As a
result we obtained for closed trajectories of orbital dynam-
ics the explicit time solution (1) in the base of periodized
wavelets (10).

4 NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

In this part we consider numerical illustrations of previous
analytical approach. Our numerical calculations are based
on periodic compactly supported Daubechies wavelets and
related wavelet families (Fig. 1). Also in our modelling we
added noise as perturbation to our spin orbit conﬁgurations.
On Fig. 2 we present according to formulae (2),(6) con-
tributions to approximation of our dynamical evolution (top
row on the Fig. 3) starting from the coarse approximation,
corresponding to scale 20 (bottom row) to the ﬁnest one
corresponding to the scales from 21 to 25 or from slow

mation. Then on Fig. 3, from bottom to top, we demon-
strate the summation of contributions from corresponding
levels of resolution given on Fig. 2 and as result we re-
store via 5 scales (frequencies) approximation our dynam-
ical process(top row on Fig. 3 ). The same decomposi-
tion/approximation we produce also on the level of power
spectral density in the process with noise (Fig. 4).

Kinetics of the polarization buildup at the interaction of stored protons (antiprotons) with a
polarized target is considered. It is demonstrated that for small scattering angles, when a projectile
remains in the beam, the polarization buildup is completely due to the spin-ﬂip transitions. The
corresponding cross sections turn out to be negligibly small for a hydrogen gas target as well as for
a pure electron target. For the latter, the ﬁltering mechanism also does not provide a noticeable
beam polarization.

INTRODUCTION

At present, the use of a polarized hydrogen gas target to polarize stored antiprotons is widely discussed (see, e.g.,
[1] and literature therein). The modiﬁcations of the method ﬁrst proposed in [2] are considered. The original idea of
spin ﬁltering is based on the dependence of the scattering cross section on the mutual orientation of the target and
projectile proton spins. Then the protons having opposite spin projections on the direction of the target polarization
go out from the beam with the diﬀerent rates. As a result, the beam acquires a polarization.

The method suggested in [2] has been realized in the experiment [3], where 23-MeV stored protons scattered on an
internal gas target of the polarized hydrogen atoms. In 90 minutes, the intensity of the beam was 5% of the initial one
and the polarization degree amounted to 2.4%. In [3], the rate of polarization buildup due to ﬁltering mechanism was
also estimated theoretically, taking into account only strong pp interaction. This estimation is noticeably diﬀerent
from the experimental result. The explanation of this disagreement is proposed in [4]. In that paper the importance
of the interference of the Coulomb amplitude and the spin-dependent part of the hadronic amplitude is emphasized.
Under conditions of the experiment [3], this eﬀect diminishes the corresponding cross section more than by 40 %,
thereby, improving essentially agreement with the experiment. Our calculations conﬁrm the estimation of this eﬀect
obtained in [4].

The remaining diﬀerence between the experimental and theoretical results, which is rather small, is explained in [4]
by two new mechanisms. Both mechanisms are related to scattering at the angle ϑ smaller than the acceptance angle
θacc ≪ 1, where protons remain in the beam. The ﬁrst eﬀect, suggested in [5], is due to the interaction of a projectile
with the polarized electrons of the hydrogen gas target. The second one, considered in [4], is due to scattering on
polarized protons of the target at ϑ < θacc. The estimation of these two eﬀects, made in [4], gives the contributions
to the rate of polarization buildup close in the absolute values but of the opposite sign. The magnitude of each eﬀect
is comparable with that corresponding to ﬁltering eﬀect. The result accounting for all three contributions agrees very
well with the experiment. Basing on the results of [5], a method to polarize an antiproton beam was suggested in [1].
The idea of Ref. [1] is in the use of a hydrogen gas target with the high electron and low proton polarizations.

In the present paper, we demonstrate that the consideration of both new eﬀects performed in [4, 5] is not correct.
We show that, for scattering at ϑ < θacc (a projectile remains in the beam), the polarization buildup is completely due
to spin-ﬂip transitions. For ϑ ≪ 1, a noticeable contribution to the spin-dependent part of the diﬀerential cross section
appears as a result of interference between the spin-independent Coulomb amplitude and spin-dependent amplitude.
This is because of the singularity of the Coulomb amplitude at small scattering angles (∝ 1/ϑ2). Evidently, such
interference is absent in scattering with the spin ﬂip of a projectile, and the corresponding cross section is negligibly
small. The formulas used in [4, 5] for the description of their two eﬀects correspond to such interference and, therefore,
are irrelevant to the kinetics of polarization.

II. KINETICS OF POLARIZATION

2

We consider a beam of particles with the densities in the momentum space f+(p, t) and f−(p, t) , where subscripts
correspond to the spin projections ±1/2 on a quantization axis. Let Wσf σi (pf , pi) be the probability of the transition
from the state with the momentum pi and polarization σi to the state with the momentum pf and polarization σf .
Then we have for the densities f± the conventional kinetic equation:

f+(p, t) = −

dp′[W++(p′, p) + W−+(p′, p)]f+(p, t)

dp′[W++(p, p′)f+(p′, t) + W+−(p, p′)f−(p′, t)] ,

f−(p, t) = −

Here p′ ∈ Γ means that the momentum p′ belongs to the beam momentum space (the angle between the momentum
p′ and the beam axis is less than θacc). Taking in Eq.(1) the integral over p ∈ Γ, we obtain

As seen from Eq.(2), in the term where both momenta p and p′ belong to Γ, only the spin-ﬂip probabilities are
present. In other words, scattering without loss of particles may lead to a beam polarization solely due to the spin-ﬂip
transitions. Due to phase space cooling, the distributions fσ(p, t) are peaked in the narrow region around a momentum
p0. Then we obtain

[N+(t) − N−(t)] = −Ωout

For the scattering angle ϑ > θacc, the momentum transfer is much larger than 1/a0 (a0 is the Bohr radius, ~ = c = 1).
In this case scattering oﬀ hydrogen atom can be considered as independent scattering oﬀ a free electron and a free
proton. The maximum scattering angle of a proton on an electron at rest is less than θacc for any storage ring.
Therefore, scattering on electrons at rest does not contribute to Ωout

III. PROBABILITIES AND CROSS SECTIONS FOR PP SCATTERING

Let us direct the polar axis along the unit vector ν = p0/p0. Then the cross section of pp scattering integrated
over the azimuth angle and summed up over the ﬁnal polarization of both protons in the center-of-mass frame reads

dσ = 2π sin ϑ dϑ {F0(ϑ) + (ζt · ζb)F1(ϑ) + (ζt · ν)(ζb · ν)[F2(ϑ) − F1(ϑ)]} ,

where ζt and ζb are the unit polarization vectors of the protons from the target and the beam, respectively. The

If θacc ≪ α/(vpH), H is a typical magnitude of the hadronic amplitudes, then the main contribution to the cross
section σ0 in Eq.(1) comes from the integration region ϑ ∼ θacc ≪ 1, where F0(ϑ) ≃ |f (ϑ)|2. Thus, this contribution
has pure electromagnetic origin:

Let us consider the quantities σ1s, σ2s, σ1d, and σ2d (see Eq.(12)), which determine the functions Ω+− and Ω−+. The
latter correspond to the spin-ﬂip transitions at ϑ ≤ θacc ≪ 1. Using the nonrelativistic electromagnetic amplitudes

where κ = 1.79 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton. Though the corresponding cross sections is
logarithmically enhanced, it is negligibly small being proportional to α2/m2
p. Thus, scattering events, where projectiles
stay in the beam, do not lead to the beam polarization.

IV. PURE ELECTRON TARGET

The time dependence of the beam polarization is described again by Eq.(5) , but with another expressions for the
cross sections in Eqs.(11) and (12), which correspond now to the pure electromagnetic electron-proton interaction.
The cross section accounting for the polarizations of the initial and ﬁnal proton and electron is well known (see,
e.g.,[10]).

The functions Ωout

− are related to the scattering events, where particles go out from the beam. Below we
consider head-on collisions of electrons and protons in the laboratory frame. For any storage ring, θacc ≫ me/mp ≈
0.5mrad. Then the particle loss occurs at pe > pout, where

mechanism using the loss of particles due to proton scattering on polarized electrons (ﬁltering) does not work for any
parameters of the electron beam.

Let us consider now the mechanism of the polarization buildup without loss of the particles, which is due to the
spin-ﬂip transitions. Starting with the general expressions for the cross section of polarized electron-proton scattering,
[10], we ﬁnd that the cross sections σs and σd in Eq.(12) are maximal at small relative velocity of electron and proton.
In this case, we estimate σd ∼ 16πµ2
p ∼ 10−3mb , µp is the proton magnetic moment. As compared with σd, the cross
section σs is enhanced by some logarithmic factor, which can not change essentially the conclusion on its smallness.
We emphasize that the cross sections are small because the spin-ﬂip amplitude does not contain a term ∝ 1/ϑ2 at
ϑ → 0, contrary to the amplitude without the spin-ﬂip transition where such term (Coulomb term) is present. Thus,
for a pure electron target, the mechanism of polarization buildup based on the spin-ﬂip transitions also does not work.
In conclusion, it is demonstrated that, for θ < θacc (a proton remains in the beam), the polarization buildup is
completely due to the spin-ﬂip transitions. The corresponding cross sections turn out to be negligibly small for both
proton-proton and proton-electron scattering. For a pure electron target, ﬁltering mechanism also does not provide
a noticeable polarization. Evidently, these statements are valid for the antiproton beam as well. Thus, the ﬁltering
method using a hydrogen gas target with the proton polarization seems to be the most promising way to polarize
stored antiprotons.

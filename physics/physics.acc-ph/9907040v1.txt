Multiple resonance compensation for betraton
coupling and its equivalence with matrix method

Abstract

Analyses of betatron coupling can be broadly divided into two categories: the
matrix approach that decouples the single-turn matrix to reveal the normal modes
and the hamiltonian approach that evaluates the coupling in terms of the action
of resonances in perturbation theory. The latter is often regarded as being less
exact but good for physical insight. The common opinion is that the correction of
the two closest sum and diﬀerence resonances to the working point is suﬃcient to
reduce the oﬀ-axis terms in the 4
4 single-turn matrix, but this is only partially
true. The reason for this is explained, and a method is developed that sums to
inﬁnity all coupling resonances and, in this way, obtains results equivalent to the
matrix approach. The two approaches is discussed with reference to the dynamic
aperture. Finally, the extension of the summation method to resonances of all
orders is outlined and the relative importance of a single resonance compared to all
resonances of a given order is analytically described as a function of the working
point.

1 Introduction

The example of linear betatron coupling will be used in the ﬁrst instance to demonstrate
the summation of the inﬂuences of all the resonances in a given family into a single driving
term. It will then be shown that is in fact a general result that can be applied to all linear
and non-linear resonances.
Analyses of betatron coupling can be broadly divided into two categories: the matrix
approach [3], [4], [5] that decouples the single-turn matrix to reveal the normal modes
and the hamiltonian approach [6], [7] that evaluates the coupling in terms of the action
of resonances using a perturbation method. The latter is often regarded as being less
exact but good for physical insight. The general belief is that the correction of the two

2×2). Coupling compensation is achieved by setting the two 2

matrices n and m to zero. Due to symplecticity and periodicity of T only four free
parameters (that is the strengths of four compensator units) are required. However, this
compensation is only valid at the origin of T.
A transformation can also be applied to the matrix T that decouples the linear motion,
so making it possible to describe the beam in the whole machine with the well-known
Courant and Snyder parametrisation in the transformed coordinates.

1.2 Classical hamiltonian method for coupling compensation

This method is based on the expansion in a Fourier series of the coupling perturbation
term in the Hamiltonian. The standard procedure is to assume that the low-frequency
components dominate the motion and that only the nearest sum and diﬀerence resonances
therefore require compensation (single resonance compensation).
The essential diﬀerence between this and the matrix approach is:

•
•

The matrix method is exact while the hamiltonian method is approximate;
A coupling compensation made by the matrix method is only valid at one point in

the ring whereas the hamiltonian method gives a global correction;

•

The matrix method leaves ﬁnite excitations in all resonances, including those closest
to the working point, whereas the hamiltonian method leaves ﬁnite excitations only in
the far resonances.

The reason for the two last points is that the matrix method includes all resonances
automatically and combines them in such a way that the matrix is uncoupled at one
point, while the hamiltonian method sets only the closest sum and diﬀerence resonances
to zero. If the far resonances have little eﬀect, then the two methods are virtually equiv-
alent. This is however an uncommon situation.
The logical implication is that by ﬁnding a way to sum all the resonances, the classical
hamiltonian method can be made to reproduce the results found with the matrix method.
Once this is done, the natural questions are which of the two methods is the better for
operation, and if the principle can be extended to higher orders.

The aims of this paper are the following:

•

To outline a summed resonance compensation procedure (taking into account both
the low and high-frequency part of the perturbative Hamiltonian) for the case of linear
coupling and to extend this result to the non-linear case (Section 2);

•

To analytically compare (Section 3) the single and summed resonance theories point-
ing out some general results that can be obtained using the analytical expression of the
generalized driving term;

•

To numerically compare the single and the summed resonance compensations for the
linear coupling (the latter is shown to be equivalent to the matrix compensation) using a
4D coupled Henon map [8] (Section 4);

2 Multiple resonance compensation for linear cou-

pling

The starting point for this analysis is taken from [6], with the initial assumptions that:

the perturbative Hamiltonian is calculated at θ = 0. Since the origin is an arbitrary

•

choice, this is not a restriction;

•

solenoid ﬁelds are absent. The presence of solenoid ﬁelds does not change the argu-
ment but by omitting them the resulting equations become more transparent. They will
be added at the end.

The linear coupling compensation using the notation of [6] requires (without any ap-
proximation for removing the high frequency part):

2.3 Extention to the nonlinear case

It is clear from Section 2.2 that the procedure for summing the resonances is, in fact,
independent of the detailed form of the term A(θ) and that, with the general form of
A(θ) from [16], the method can be extended to the nonlinear case.

It is customary to use the symbols C for the coupling driving terms and K for the
higher-order non linear driving terms. There is also often a factor of 2 between the two
deﬁnitions (K = C/2 for a given resonance). Since this report concentrates on coupling
the ”C”-styled deﬁnition has been extended to all the cases.

3 General results

This section is dedicated to pointing out some of the general consequences of the summed
resonance theory.

3.1 Analytic comparison of the inﬂuence of single and summed

to that of the closest single resonance. The single resonance driving term [6] reads

The formulae (13) and (24) give the same result for the modulus of the driving terms
when exactly on resonance. A diﬀerence between (13) and (24) increases (approxima-
tively) quadratically as one moves away from ∆ integer. Agreement between the two
formalism can be therefore expected only if the working point is close enough to the res-
onance to be compensated 4.
However, this is not usually the case if the aim is the full compensation of the linear cou-
pling, that is both the sum and diﬀerence resonances. In most pratical cases, the working
point is close to the diﬀerence resonance and relatively distant from the sum resonance.

3.2 Closed-orbit distortion from a dipole kick

The equation (13) can be applied to the resonance family

Qz = p

(25)

where z
x, y. This leads to the expressions for the closed-orbit distortion due to a dipole
kick and links the single resonance theory [6], [16] to the integrated theory of Courant
and Snyder [17].

3.4 Comments

The summed resonance driving terms lead naturally to a new deﬁnition of bandwidth.
However, pratical diﬀerences maybe not so clearly observed. When the working point is
close to a resonance, the bandwidth is important but the single and summed theories do
not diﬀer much. When the working point is far from the resonance, the bandwidth is
unimportant and any widening may go unnoticed.
There is also the more academic point that the magnitude of the summed resonance
driving term is dependent on the azimuthal position in the machine. The closed orbit is
a very good example of this. If there is a closed bump in the orbit, then the Re(C1,0,∞) is
zero outside the bump and ﬁnite inside. The implication is that the beam is responding to
standing waves from each member of the resonance family. The summed response is the
sum of these standing waves. When inside a bandwidth the growth rates are related to
the standing wave amplitude and varying according to the position around the machine.

4 The coupled Henon map

In this section, the summed resonance approach is shown to be equivalent to the matrix
approach and both are compared to the single-resonance compensation by performing
a numerical analysis on the so-called Henon map [8]: a hyper-simpliﬁed lattice model 5
whose phase-space trajectories show some of the expected characteristic of a realistic lat-
tice map (nonlinearities, regions of regular and stochastic motion etc.) In this application
the linear coupling is generated and corrected by 1+4 thin skew quadrupoles 6.

5A linear lattice model containing only one sextupolar kick.
6Lattices with only solenoids or with both types of coupling elements give the same kind of results.

10

The compensation for both the sum and the diﬀerence resonance is obtained solving the
system of 4-equations (for the 4 unknowns ki) given by (37).

The global compensation of the coupling resonances (at θ=0) is achieved if

[Re(∆C −

∞) + iIm(∆C −

∞)] = 0

[Re(∆C +

∞) + iIm(∆C +

∞)] = 0.

The oﬀ-axis terms are in fact larger after the compensation then before. This is explained
by the inﬂuence of the far resonances that can not be neglected, to get a satisfactory
coupling compensation in this case.

Last two equations show that the sets of the uncompensated sum and diﬀerence reso-
nances have a ”weight” comparable (larger in the case of the diﬀerence resonance) to the
ones compensated.

The quantitative diﬀerence between the two approaches can be better investigated by
means of a tracking analysis.
In the following, the results from stability and footprint diagrams as well as the calculation
of the dynamic aperture for the compensated Henon map are shown.

4.1 Stability and footprint diagrams

A stability diagram and the related frequency diagram can be obtained by the follow-
ing procedure: for each initial condition inside a given grid in the physical plane (x, y)
(px = py = 0), the symplectic map representing the lattice is iterated over a certain
number of turns. If the orbit is still stable after the last turn, the nonlinear tunes can be
calculated using one of the methods described in [12]. In the stability diagram the stable
initial conditions are plotted whereas in the frequency diagram are represented the corre-
sponding tunes. The insertion in the frequency (footprint) diagram of the straight lines
representing the resonant conditions up to a certain order makes it possible to visualize
the excited resonances close to the reference orbit.

Figs. (5) - (10) show the stability and frequency diagrams for the uncoupled Henon

map, after the single resonance compensation and after the summed resonance one.
The comparison points out that the summed resonance compensation allows a more ef-
ﬁcient restoration of the uncoupled optics. It is signiﬁcant the analysis of the degree of
excitation relative to the resonances (3,-6), (1,-4) and (2,-5) for the two diﬀerent compen-
sation approaches.

Using the perturbative tools of normal forms [13] one can calculate the value of the
ﬁrst resonant coeﬃcient (leading term) in the interpolating Hamiltonian for the consid-
ered resonances. The leading term can be considered as a ”measure” of the resonance
excitation. It can be shown [14] that in absence of coupling the leading term of the res-
onances (3,-6) and (1,-4) is diﬀerent from zero (ﬁrst order excitation) whereas the one of

12

the resonance (2,-5) is zero (second order excitation). The strength of the coupling (that
is, in the considered case, the strength of the residual coupling after the compensations)
is proportional to the growth of the leading term of the ﬁrst order non-excited resonances
and to the decrease of the leading term of the other ones.
The resonance degree of the excitation varying the compensation approach can be better
visualized ploting the network of the resonances and their widths inside the stability do-
main. The analysis of Figs. (2)-(4) conﬁrms that the SR method is characterized by a
residual coupling considerably stronger than the one left by the MR compensation.
The same conclusion can be drawn the following topological argument. A trace of the
presence of linear coupling in a nonlinear lattice is the spliting of the resonant channels
in correspondence of the crossing points (multiple resonance condition in the tune space).
This phenomenon is evident only in the case of the MR compensation (see the central
part of Fig. (4)).

4.2 Dynamic aperture calculations

The dynamic aperture as a function of the number of turns N can be deﬁned [15] as the
ﬁrst amplitude where particle loss occurs, averaged over the phase space. Particle are
started along a grid in the physical plane (x, y):

x = r cos θ

y = r sin θ

(42)

and initial momenta px and py are set to zero.
Let r(θ, N) be the last stable initial condition along θ before the ﬁrst loss (at a turn
number lower than N). The dynamic aperture is deﬁned as

D =

[r(θ, N)]4 sin(2θ)dθ

and the angular coordinate can be obtained replacing the dynamic aperture deﬁnition with
a simple average over θ. Using a Gaussian sum in quadrature the associated error reads

where ∆r and ∆θ are the step sizes in r and θ respectively.
In Tab. 2 the values (with the associated errors) of the dynamic aperture are quoted for
the three studied optics for short (N=5000) and medium (N=20000) term tracking.

The diﬀerence between the summed and the single resonance compensations is notice-
able: the compensation of the all families relative to the coupling resonances allows an
improvement close to 10% respect to the case in which the high frequency part of the
perturbative hamiltonian is neglected.
It can also be pointed out that the summed compensation seems to slightly improve (at
the limit of sensitivity due to errors) the dynamic aperture respect to the uncoupled case.

formula (44)) is about 2% for N=5000 and about 4% for N=20000.

5 The nonlinear case

Dealing with high-order resonances with a view to optimizating stability is not so straight-
forward as in the linear case: the number of resonances that can be excited both by a
given multipole and by the set of correctors meant for compensating a given resonance
becomes higer and higher; moreover the resonance compensation is only one of the tools
that has to be used to get a succesfully optics optimization.

For these reasons we have not here attempted a general comparison between the
summed and the single resonance compensations using tracking analysis. We intend to
return to this question in the future.
We note however that a certain number of attempts to compensate one particular sex-
tupolar resonance for the Henon map show that the two compensations are not far only
if the working point is close enough to the considered resonance. The summed resonance
compensation is to in general better in the case of the compensation of several resonances
at the same time.

6 Conclusions

A general method has been derived for the summation of all the resonances within a given
family both for the linear and for the non-linear cases. The fact that this summation is
valid and gives a meaningful result is conﬁrmed by its application to the known closed-
orbit distortion equation, the betatron modulation equation and the decoupling of the
linear transfer matrix for a ring. The application of the summed-resonance driving term
to the coupling raises the question of the relative merits of the diﬀerent types of coupling
compensation that are now possible. This problem has been investigated with the help
of the Henon map. The results indicate that use of the summed-resonance compensation
(equivalent to the matrix approach) yields a larger dynamics aperture.

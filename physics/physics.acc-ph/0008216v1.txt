Abstract
The sextupole magnets in the Low Energy Ring (LER) of
PEP-II are grouped in pairs with a phase advance of 180 de-
grees. Displacing the magnets or moving the orbit to dis-
place the beam in the magnets in an antisymmetric way cre-
ates a dispersion wave around the ring. This can be used to
correct the vertical dispersion in LER without changing the
local coupling. Results from simulations are shown.

INTRODUCTION

The luminosity of PEP-II is currently mainly determined
by the vertical beam size at the interaction point (IP). In the
Low Energy Ring (LER) the vertical beam size at the IP is,
to some extent, caused by the residual vertical dispersion in
the ring. It is hoped that by lowering the dispersion in the
ring, the vertical beam size at the IP can be decreased and
the luminosity therefore increased.

The sextupoles to correct the chromaticity in LER are
grouped in non-interleaved pairs of the same strength.
Therefore moving one of the sextupoles of a pair up (or
moving the beam in the sextupole using a closed orbit
bump) and the other one of the pair down creates a disper-
sion wave around the ring without affecting the coupling or
the orbit outside the region. We want to use one or more of
these dispersion waves to try to cancel some of the resid-
ual vertical dispersion in the ring in order to minimize the
vertical beam size at the IP.

2 SIMULATION

2.1 LEGO
The simulations are done using LEGO [1]. Five different
seeds are used for the misalignment. All ﬁve seeds give
RMS dispersions and orbits of the size that is observed in
the real machine. Orbit and dispersion are corrected using
the same algorithms that are used in the control room. The
coupling is minimized using the closest tune approach in a
way similar to the procedure used in the control room on
the real ring.

2.2 Effects of Sextupole Alignment
For a vertical alignment error of 0.5 mm for the sextupoles
(this is assumed to be the error in the machine), the residual
vertical dispersions for these seeds are between 5 and 6 cm.

Using an error of 1 mm, the dispersions are only slightly
larger for four seeds and grow from 6 to almost 7.2 cm for
one seed. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the dispersion
on the average error. average.

2.3 Moving Sextupole Pairs
In the simulations we currently move the sextupoles by
changing their alignment. This is easier and ”cleaner” than
a closed orbit bump.

A sextupole pair is chosen. The simulation program then
loops over position changes from −5 to +5 mm in steps of
one mm. One of the two magnets is moved up by the ap-
propriate amount, the other one down (taking into account
the original (mis-)alignment of the magnet).

At each step the dispersion and the vertical beam size at
the IP are calculated. The vertical beam size is calculated
using the algorithm described in [2].

The correction algorithm was studied for vertical sex-
tupole misalignments of 0.5 and 1.0 mm, where the average
dispersion for the ﬁve seeds is 5.5 and 5.9 cm respectively.
The average beam sizes at the IP are 3.52 and 4.11 µm. For
each calculation two different sextupole pairs and the same
ﬁve different seeds as before are used.

see that the two parameters have their minimum not at the
same misalignment.

From each the dispersion and the beam size one can ob-
tain an optimal position for the respective sextupole pair
(see Fig. 2). However, the results of the two don’t always
agree with each other.

Moving one sextupole pair such that the minimum dis-
the vertical beam size on average
persion is obtained,
shrinks slightly to 3.51 and 4.07 µm respectively (to be
compared to 3.52 and 4.11 µm). In this case the sextupoles
have to be moved on average by 0.8 and 1.2 mm respec-
tively.

Using the minimum of the vertical beam size one can ob-
tain slightly better results: 3.50 and 4.06 µm respectively.

4 CONCLUSION

Unfortunately for this method, the general steering algo-
rithm in PEP-II is good enough to obtain small dispersions
and small vertical beam sizes. Moving sextupole pairs
can decrease the vertical beam size only by about 0.1 µm,
which is of the order of two to three percent. Using this
method on the real machine is made complicated by two
things: In the machine closed orbit bumps have to be used
instead of moving the magnets themselves and it is not very
easy to optimize on the vertical beam size at the IP itself
which seems to be the method to be used giving the differ-
ence in location of the minima.

Nevertheless the method might be useful on the real ma-
chine as the dispersion correction in the steering package
currently works not very well. This method might be faster
and more efﬁcient. This will be studied.

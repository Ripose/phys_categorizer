ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION OF

THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE CSR EFFECTS

R. Li, Jefferson Lab, 12000 Jefferson Ave., Newport News, VA 23606, USA

Abstract
Recent measurements of the coherent synchrotron radia-
tion (CSR) effects indicated that the observed beam emit-
tance growth and energy modulation are often bigger than
previous predictions based on Gaussian longitudinal charge
distributions. In this paper, by performing a model study,
we show both analytically and numerically that when the
longitudinal bunch charge distribution involves concentra-
tion of charges in a
small fraction of the bunch length,
enhancement of the CSR self-interaction beyond the Gaus-
sian prediction may occur. The level of this enhancement
is sensitive to the level of the local charge concentration.

1

INTRODUCTION

When a short bunch with high charge is transported through
a magnetic bending system, orbit-curvature-induced bunch
self-interaction via CSR and space charge can potentially
induce energy modulation in the bunch and cause emit-
tance growth. Even though the earlier analytical results for
CSR self-interaction [1, 2] based on the rigid-line-charge
model can be applied for general longitudinal charge dis-
tributions, since the analytical results for a Gaussian beam
are explicitly given, one usually applies the Gaussian re-
sults to predict the CSR effects using the measured or sim-
ulated rms bunch length. Similarly, a self-consistent simu-
lation [3] was developed ealier to study the CSR effect on
bunch dynamics for general bunch distributions; however,
the simulation is usually carried out using an assumed ini-
tial Gaussian longitudinal phase space distribution. Recent
CSR experiments [4, 5] indicated that the measured energy
spread and emittance growth are sometimes bigger than
previous Gaussian predictions, especially when a bunch is
fully compressed or over-compressed. In this paper, we ex-
plore the possible enhancement of the CSR self-interaction
force due to extra longitudinal concentration of charges as
opposed to a Gaussian distribution. This study reveals a
general feature of the CSR self-interaction: whenever there
is longitudinal charge concentration in a small fraction of
a bunch length, enhancement of the CSR effect beyond the
Gaussian prediction can occur; moreover, the level of this
enhancement is sensitive to the level of the local charge
concentration within a bunch. This sensitivity should be
given serious considertation in designs of future machines.

2 BUNCH COMPRESSION OPTICS

When an electron bunch is fully compressed by a magnetic
chicane, the ﬁnal bunch length and the inner structure of
the ﬁnal longitudinal phase space are determined by many
details of the machine design. In this paper, we investigate
only the RF curvature effect, which serves as a model to

illustrate the possible sensitivity of the CSR interaction to
the longitudinal charge distribution.

In order to study the CSR self-interaction for a com-
pressed bunch, let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the longitudinal charge dis-
tribution for our model bunch when it is fully compressed
by a chicane. Consider an electron bunch with N total elec-
trons. The longitudinal charge density of the bunch at time

t is ρ(s, t) = N en(s, t) (R n(s, t)ds = 1), where s is the

distance from the reference electron, and n(s, t) is the lon-
gitudinal density distribution of the bunch. At t = t0, let
the bunch be aligned on the design orbit at the entrance of
a bunch compression chicane, with a Gaussian longitudinal
density distribution and rms bunch length σs0

n(s0, t0) = n0(µ) =

1

√2πσs0

e−µ2/2σ2

s0 .

(1)

Here we let each electron be identiﬁed by the parameter µ,
which is its initial longitudinal position

s(µ, t0) = s0 = µ

(s > 0 for bunch head).

(2)

In order to compress the bunch using the chicane, a linear
energy correlation was imposed on the bunch by an up-
stream RF cavity, along with a slight second-order energy
correlation due to the curvature of the RF wave form. The
relative energy deviation from the design energy is then

σs0 − δ2(cid:18) µ

σs0(cid:19)2

δ(µ, t0) = −δ1

(δ1, δ2 > 0, δ2 ≪ δ1),
(3)
where we assume no uncorrelated energy spread. When
the beam propagates to the end of the chicane at t = tf , the
ﬁnal longitudinal coordinates of the electrons are

s(µ, tf ) = s(µ, t0) + R56δ(µ, t0) + T566[δ(µ, t0)]2 (4)

= s(µ, t0)(1 −

with α ≡ (R56δ2 − T566δ2
maximum compression of the bunch by choosing the ini-
tial bunch length and the initial energy spread to satisfy
s(µ, tf ) = sf = −α[s(µ, t0)]2.
1 − R56δ1/σs0 = 0,
(6)
For typical bunch compression chicane, one has R56 > 0
and T566 < 0. Therefore α > 0, which implies sf ≤ 0
from Eq. (6). Using Eqs. (6) and (2), we have

µ(sf ) = q−sf /α

(α > 0, sf ≤ 0).

The ﬁnal longitudinal density distribution can be obtained
from charge conservation n0(µ)dµ = n(sf , tf )dsf :

is dominated by the radiation interaction:

where H(−sf ) is the Heaviside step function, and σsf is
the rms of the ﬁnal longitudinal distribution. The ﬁnal lon-

The CSR power due to the radiation interaction is

For example, when σs0 = 1.26 mm, R56 = 45 mm, and
δ1 = 0.028, the compression condition Eq. (6) is satisﬁed.
With α = 0.08 mm−1, Eq. (9) gives the ﬁnal compressed
bunch length σsf = 0.18 mm. For a realistic beam, uncor-
related energy spread δun should be added to Eq. (3) (here
we assume δun has a Gaussian distribution with hδuni = 0,
and rms width δrms
un ). As a result, one ﬁnds the ﬁnal rms
bunch length satisﬁes

ple of the longitudinal phase space distribution described
by Eq. (10), with an additional width due to δun 6= 0 as
given by Eq. (11), is shown in Fig.1.

3 CSR FOR A COMPRESSED BEAM

Next, we study the CSR self-interaction of a rigid-line com-
pressed bunch in the steady-state circular motion. The lon-
gitudinal density distribution function of the bunch is λ(φ)
for φ = s/R, with the rms angular width σφ = σs/R for
the rms bunch length σs and the orbit radius R.

3.1 General Formulas

charge and CSR self-interaction is [1, 2]:

3.2 CSR Interaction for a Compressed Bunch
The angular distribution for a compressed bunch λcmpr(φ)
with intrinsic width due to δun 6= 0 is the convolution of
the angular density distribution λcmpr

a Gaussian distribution λm(φ):

for a rigid-line bunch with the density function given in
Eq. (19) under the condition σφ > σmφ ≫ γ−3. Com-
bining Eq. (19) with Eq. (13), and denoting a as the in-
trinsic width of the bunch relative to the rms bunch length
(0 < a < 1):

Numerical integration shows that |f (y; a)|max — the
maximum of |f (y; a)| for ﬁxed a — is insensitive to a for
0 < a < 1. As a result, for a compressed bunch with ﬁxed
σφ, we found from Eq. (27) the amplitude of the CSR force
F cmpr
(φ) varies with a−5/6. Therefore in contrast to the
θ
well-known scaling law R−2/3σ−4/3
for the amplitude of
the longitudinal CSR force for a Gaussian beam, a bunch
described by Eq. (19) has |F cmpr
σ−5/6
w
with σw in Eq. (22) denoting the intrinsic width of the
bunch. Likewise, for a=0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, we found from
numerical integration that I(a) ≃ 0.76, 0.90 and 1.02 re-
spectively, and correspondingly P cmpr/P Gauss ≃ 3.9, 2.6
and 1.4. This dependence of the amplitude of the CSR
force and power on the intrinsic width of the bunch for a
ﬁxed rms bunch length manifests the sensitivity of the en-
hancement of the CSR effect on the local charge concen-
tration in a longitudinal charge distribution.

In Figs. 2 and 3, we plot the longitudinal density function
for various charge distributions with the same rms bunch
lengths (except the √1 + a2 factor in Eq. (11)), and the
longitudinal CSR collective forces associated with the var-
ious distributions. The amplitude of F cmpr
in Fig. 3 agrees
with the a−5/6 dependence in Eq. (27). Good agreement

θ

of the analytical result in Eq. (27) with the simulation re-
sult [3] for the CSR force along the example distribution in
Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 4.

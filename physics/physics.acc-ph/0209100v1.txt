Radiation by a relativistic charged particle in
self-wakeﬁeld in periodic structure

Abstract

A new elementary mechanism of radiation due to the oscillatory character of a
radiation reaction force appearing when a relativistic charged particle moves along
a periodic structure without external ﬁelds is investigated. It is shown that the non-
synchronous spatial harmonics of Cherenkov-type radiation (CR) can give rise to
the oscillation of a particle which consequently generates undulator-type radiation
(UR). In the spectral region, where the diﬀraction of generated waves is essential,
the radiation manifests itself in the coherent interference of CR and UR. A pure
undulator-type radiation takes place only in the wavelength range where the wave
diﬀraction can be neglected. In the case of coherent UR emitted by a bunch of N
electrons, the UR power is proportional to N 4.

Key words: electrons, periodic structure, wakeﬁeld, undulator radiation

1 Introduction

In this paper we oﬀer a new mechanism of radiation due to the oscillatory
character of a reaction force arising as a relativistic charged particle moves
through a periodic structure. The impossibility of oscillatory motion of a free
charged particle in the self-ﬁeld has been proved in [1]. However, it is also
well known that a charged particle moving at a constant velocity along the
periodic structure emits the Cherenkov-type radiation (or the diﬀraction ra-
diation) [2]. The ﬁelds of this radiation, called as wakeﬁelds, can be expressed
as a spatial-harmonics series expansion according to Floquet’s theorem. The

action of synchronous spatial harmonics of the self-wakeﬁelds on the particle
results in energy losses associated with the Cherenkov-type radiation. Under
certain conditions, the non-synchronous spatial harmonics give rise to the os-
cillatory motion of the particle that consequently generates the undulator-type
radiation. This radiation is the subject of discusson in this article.

2 Methodology

As a periodic structure, we will consider the vacuum corrugated waveguide
with a metallic surface. Such structures are commonly used in rf linacs. Let a
particle having the ultrarelativistic velocity v , the charge e and the mass m
moves along the structure with the period D. The longitudinal component of
the velocity vz, parallel to the structure axis, is very close to the velocity of
light c. The radiation reaction force and the radiation power have to be found.

For calculating the radiation reaction force we will use the approach developed
in [3]. At ﬁrst, we will suppose that the charged particle is not a point charge,
r (t)]. Here r (t) is the radius
but is distributed with density ρ = ef [r
−
f (r ) d3r = 1. The equation
vector of the center of mass of the particle and
of motion for the center of mass is written as

As the radiation reaction force F (t), unlike the electromagnetic mass, does
not depend on the particle size r0 (where r0 is meant in the laboratory frame
of reference), the distribution function f [r
r (t)] can be replaced by the
Dirac δ-function, and in the sum of Eq. (6) only the frequencies ωλ < c/r0 are
taken account [3]. The eigenfunctions of the vector potential for the periodic
structures with perfectly conducting walls are usually given in the Floquet
form [2]

The set of eigenfunctions (7) for inﬁnitely long periodic waveguide is physically
limited in frequency by the value of electron plasma frequency ωe in the metal.
ωe , the conduction of metal walls strongly falls oﬀ, and
As is known, if ωλ ∼
the diﬀraction conditions in the periodic structure are disrupted. So, in the
spectral region ωe < ωλ, where the wave diﬀraction can be neglected, the
periodic waveguide can be considered as a free space. In this part of frequency
spectrum, the vector potential is sought as expansion in terms of the plane
waves

Aλ,l(r ) = c√4πa λleik λr ,

where k λ is the wave propagation vector; a λl are the real unit vectors of
polarization (l = 1, 2), perpendicular to k λ.

3 The zeroth-order wake force

In the ultrarelativistic limit, the equation of motion (6) can be solved by the
method of successive approximations. We will ﬁnd non-relativistic corrections
c . As a zeroth order approximation, we consider
for the particle velocity v0 ≈
the uniform motion of the charged particle parallel to the waveguide axis:

Inserting Eqs. (7) and (9) (for the frequency region ωλ ≪

approximation in the form of a wake force

In the range of ωe < ωλ, where the structure is supposed as a free space,
there is no radiation in the zeroth order approximation (at v 0 = const).

If the charged particle moves oﬀ-axis, it experiences the action of the trans-
verse component of nonsynchronous harmonics of the wake force (w (p)
= 0).

So, we will ﬁnd non-relativistic corrections for both the velocity v 0 and the
radius vector r ⊥ of the oﬀ-axis particle that are caused by the periodic trans-
verse wake force. We assume that the change in the longitudinal velocity is
negligible. Putting Eq. (10) into the equation of motion (6) we correct the law

is caused by the oscillation of the particle in the nonsynchronous harmonics

the total radiation power tends to the CR power with increasing γ.

Let us next consider the radiation of the charge particle in the range ωe < ωλ.
In analogy with Eq. (15), substituting Eqs. (12), (13) and (8) into Eq. (6), we

5 Conclusions

The new radiation mechanism considered above may be of use in undula-
tors based on periodic structures without external ﬁelds, where the non-
synchronous wake-harmonics of an electron bunch act as pump waves. These

wakeﬁeld undulators require no magnetic ﬁelds or rf sources needed in present-
day FEL. Note also that the undulator-type radiation power is proportional
to γ2. So, in the future high energy electron rf linacs, in view of deviation of
a beam from the linacs axis, because of the coherent betatron oscillation of
the beam in a focussing system, the interaction of electrons with the spatial
non-synchronous harmonics of both an accelerating mode [4] and a wake-
ﬁeld may result in the electron energy loss associated with the spontaneous
undulator-type radiation.

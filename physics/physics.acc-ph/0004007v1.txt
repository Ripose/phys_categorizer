ABSTRACT

The starting point of the theory of Special Relativity1 is the Lorentz transfor-

mation, which in essence describes the lack of absolute measurements of space and

time. These eﬀects came about when one applies the Second Relativity Postulate

(which states that the speed of light is a universal constant) to inertial observers.

Here I demonstrate that there is a very elegant way of explaining how exactly

nature enforces Special Relativity, which compels us to conclude that Einstein’s

theory necessitated quantization of space and time. The model proposes that

microscopically the structure of space-time is analogous to a crystal which con-

sists of lattice points or ‘tickmarks’ (for measurements) connected by identical

‘elastic springs’. When at rest the ‘springs’ are at their natural states. When

set in motion, however, the lattice vibrates in a manner described by Einstein’s

theory of the heat capacity of solids, with consequent widening of the ‘tickmarks’

because the root-mean-square separation now increases. I associate a vibration

temperature T with the speed of motion v via the fundamental postulate of this

theory, viz. the relation v

2 = e−

kT where ǫ is a quantum of energy of the lattice

harmonic oscillator. A moving observer who measures distances and time inter-

vals with such a vibrating lattice obtains results which are precisely those given

by the Lorentz transformation. Apart from its obvious beauty, this approach

provides many new prospects in understanding space and time. For example, an

important consequence of the model is the equation ǫ = κx2

o, where xo is the

basic ‘quantum of space’ and κ is the spring constant which holds together the

lattice. Thus space-time, like mass, has an equivalence with energy.

In Special Relativity theory the distance between two points is not absolute. If an

inertial observer Σ′ measures simultaneously the positions of the ends of a uniformly moving

rod to obtain the rod length, and if the rod is oriented parallel to its velocity v, the result

will be smaller than that of another inertial observer Σ who measures the length from a

frame of reference with respect to which the rod is at rest. The diﬀerence between the two
data values is the Lorentz factor γ = (1 − v2/c2)−
is much smaller in the limit v → c. The same conclusion applies to the measurement of
time. Thus if Σ′ witnesses a time diﬀerence between the decay of two moving elementary

2 , which means the length obtained by Σ′

particles, both having the same velocity v and disintegrated in the same spatial position,

the result is smaller than that of Σ, who measures decay times from a reference frame which

does not move with respect to either particles.

The above manner of formulating the two paramount results of Special Relativity

considers (a) the eﬀects of motion on position measurements at the same time, and (b)

time measurements at the same position. Once each phenomena is understood without

interference from the other, changes in space and time can be superposed to form a general

Lorentz transformation. Einstein originally arrived at this transformation by invoking the

Second Relativity Postulate. I propose in this Letter a new more fruitful approach which

demonstrates how Lorentz transformation is realized by a dynamic space-time lattice. We

begin with a treatment of the relativity of length, i.e. situation (a). The treatment of time

then follows immediately by considering the time lattice as being the same as that of space,

except re-scaled by the speed of light c to form a diﬀerent dimension.

The measurement ruler of Σ is calibrated according to the topmost part of Figure 1,

and is used to determine the length of the rod drawn immediately beneath. A minimum

unit of length is assumed to exist (i.e. space is quantized), which we designate as xo, and

is also the distance between any pair of black dots (hereafter referred to as lattice points)

– 4 –

on the ruler. The length of the rod is then expressed in units of xo (such a regular lattice

is not a necessary part of the theory, but for simplicity of argument we shall assume it). If

the ruler of a moving observer measures a smaller length for the same rod, this is equivalent

to having a larger quantum of distance for Σ′, i.e. the lattice points of Σ′ are more widely

spaced, as shown in the lower half of Figure 1. Speciﬁcally the length contraction eﬀect will

be achieved if, for Σ′:

where v, the velocity of Σ′ relative to Σ, is parallel to the length of the rod.

For the lattice of Σ′ every lattice point moves with velocity v like all others, so why

would this lead to a widening of the lattice ? The question arises only because we consider

motion of the lattice as a rigid body. It is entirely possible that microscopically the space

lattice points are connected by springs, and a moving lattice necessarily vibrates: the

amplitude of oscillation increasing with v. Henceforth I shall address the previous sentence

(to be made even more precise in the enusing discussions) as the Postulate of Lattice

Space-Time. Now there is an eﬀective increase in the lattice spacing x because, while the
mean separation < x > remains at xo, the root mean square xrms = √< x2 > is larger.
Indeed, an interesting aspect of Equ (1) is that the right side has the form xo√N where

N ≥ 1, which reminds one of random walk. Moreover, N has a denominator reminiscent of
quantum statistical mechanics.

To explain the Lorentz transformation, I would then begin with a harmonic oscillator.

We write x = xo + x1, with x1 representing pure sinusoidal motion, implying < x1 >= 0,

and the lattice spacing may be written as:

xrms = xo(cid:18)1 +

< x2

o (cid:19)

Next, we assume a classical oscillator and, to quantify the forementioned Postulate of

Lattice Space-Time, we make the reasonable conjecture that p< x2

1 > ∝ v = αv (meaning

– 5 –

of course that p< ˙x2

1 > is also ∝ v; such a relation applies, e.g. to a uniformly moving

lattice which started from rest as a result of an external impulse). Equ (2) now reads:

xrms = xo(cid:18)1 +

α2v2

We can therefore derive the length contraction of Equ (1) in the non-relativistic limit of
v ≪ c if in Equ (3) we set x2
and completeness, the model is at best heuristic. An exact treatment requires quantum

o/α2 = c2. However, apart from the obvious lack of elegance

mechanics, when the energy of a harmonic oscillator becomes E = (n + 1/2)ǫ where ǫ is the

basic quantum of the system. Once the complete theory is in place, we will see that the

case of v ≪ c is not even classical.

The proposed model works successfully if it allows the lattice oscillators to have varying

energies E, but the mean energy and degree of variation is governed by a temperature T

which replaces E as the monitoring parameter of the overall vibration level (i.e. T increases

with v). The model used for such a thermal quantum lattice is Einstein’s theory for the

heat capacity of solids. Here the reader is reminded of the Partition function and mean

energy per oscillator. Ignoring the zero point energy they are, respectively:

Z =

1 − e−

and ¯E = ǫe−

kT × Z. Thus if we deﬁne κ as the lattice spring constant, and refer the average

< x2

1 > to its quantum expectation value, we may write

< x2

1 >= ¯E/κ =

When Equ (4) and (5) are substituted into Equ (2), the result is in close resemblance with

that of length contraction (Equ (1)).

In fact, the analogy is striking, and provides clear guidelines on how precisely T is

related to v. Thus, to quantitatively complete the Postulate of Lattice Space-Time, I

propose this relation as:

Use of Equ (4), (5), and (6) gives:

The coincidence in form between Equ (8) and Equ (1), with the former being based on

a totally natural model which involves no manipulation of terms, renders it extremely

diﬃcult to draw conclusions other than the one which says that we are indeed confronted

with a microscopic realization of Relativity. In fact, Equ (8) agrees perfectly with Equ (1)

when the following simple relationship between the three fundamental parameters of the

space-time lattice holds:

ǫ = κx2

o

(9)

A similar equation which gives no extra information applies to the time lattice, and

is responsible for the relativity of time described earlier. This is because in Lorentz

transformation time behaves exactly like space, with the substitution x = ct. Thus time

and space are controlled by the same underlying lattice.

In conclusion , Special Relativity already revealed that even the arrangement of the

smallest quanta of our space-time fabric is highly ordered. However, one must also consider

Equ (9), which implies that the space-time ‘crystal’ has an energy equivalence. A more

immediate consequence is the quantization of the Lorentz factor γ at low v. Could this be

responsible for the discreteness in the mass of elementary particles ? The reported ﬁndings

may also be of relevance to understanding astrophysical processes, including (and especially)

– 7 –

those of the early universe. Finally, it opens the question as to how the notion of space-time

microstates presented here could facilitate further understanding and development of the

theory of General Relativity.

I am indebted to Dr Massimilano Bonamente for suggesting a harmonic oscillator

model for the space-time lattice of a moving observer.

Figure Caption

The space-time lattice of stationary (Σ) and moving (Σ′) observers are illustrated

here for the case of distance measurements. The ‘tickmarks’ of the ruler of Σ are marked

as the topmost set of black dots. The rod to be measured is the short bar immediately

beneath, and is at rest with respect to Σ. Observer Σ′ measures the length of this rod while

in motion, by simultaneously acquiring data on the positions of the front and rear end of

the rod. It is postulated that eﬀectively Σ′ is using a moving set of ‘tickmarks’, and if

microscopically these are connected by ‘elastic springs’ which can extend while in motion,

the ‘tickmarks’ widen as depicted in the lower half of the diagram. Consequently Σ′ obtains

a smaller value for the length of the rod.

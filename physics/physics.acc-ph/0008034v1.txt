Energy stabilization of 1.5 GeV S-Band linac

Abstract
KEK-ATF is studying low emittance, multi-bunch electron
beam for the future linear collider. The energy instability
of the 1.5 GeV linac has been a problem making the beam
injection to the damping ring unstable. Because the unsta-
ble beam generates also large amount of the radiation, the
beam current is limited by the KEK radiation safety policy
much lower than what we expect. Stabilizing the S-band
linac is therefore important not only to improve the beam
quality, but also to clear the radiation safety limit to start
the multi-bunch operation.

We have made various modiﬁcations to solve the prob-
lem on the electron gun, modulator, klystron etc. For the
modulator, we have developed a feed-forward controlled
De-Q module. This module compensates the voltage jitter
by controlling the deQ timing with a feed-forward circuit
because the amount of the excessive charge up is strongly
correlated to the charge up slope that can be measured
prior to the deQ timing. The energy stability was exam-
ined and was improved by a factor of 3, from 0.6% to 0.2%
of itself. Modiﬁcation for the feed-forward circuit to get
more stability was made. The test for the new circuit is in
progress. For the long term instability, phase-lock system
for klystron RF is being installed. In the test operation, it
showed a good performance and compensate the phase drift
less than 1◦.

INTRODUCTION

KEK-ATF is a test facility to study the low emittance multi-
bunch beam and beam instrumentation technique for the
future linear collider. That consists from 1.5 GeV S-band
linac, a beam transport line, a damping ring, and a diagnos-
tic extraction line.

In the linac,

the electron beam is generated by a
thermionic electron gun. Typical intensity is 1010 elec-
tron/bunch. The bunch length shrinks from 1 ns to 10 ps by
passing a couple of sub-harmonic bunchers, a TW buncher.
The electron beam is accelerated up to 1.3 GeV by 8 of
the S-band regular accelerating section. One section has
two accelerating structures driven by a klystron-modulator.
Klystron is Toshiba E3712 generating 80 MW with a pulse
duration of 4.5µs RF. A peak power of 400 MW with a
pulse duration of 1.0µs is obtained by SLED cavity and
makes a high gradient accelerating ﬁeld, 30 MeV/m.

20 of bunches separated by 2.8 ns are accelerated by
one RF pulse. This multi-bunch method is one of the key
technique in the linear collider, but ATF is now operated
in single-bunch mode because of the KEK radiation safety
policy.

In April 2000, we achieved horizontal emittance 1.3 ×

10−9rad.m, vertical emittance1.7 × 10−11rad.m (both for
2.0 × 109electron/bunch, single bunch mode )[1] which
are almost our target.

So, our next task is to achieve such low emittance with
the high intensity, high reputation multi-bunch electron
beam. To start the multi-bunch operation, we have to clear
the radiation safety limit anyhow.

One of the biggest source of the radiation is the beam
transport line. The large energy tail and the energy jitter
causes the radiation loss in the beam transport line. To sup-
press the radiation , we have to stabilize the beam energy
and also improve the quality of the beam.

In addition, the energy jitter ﬂuctuates the injection ef-
ﬁciency to the damping ring, the beam intensity becomes
therefore very unstable. The energy stabilization of the
linac is very important for the systematic study for the
beam instrumentation at the extraction line.

2 FEED-FORWARD DEQ

From a study of the energy instability[2], one of the biggest
source of the instability was klystron voltage jitter induced
by the ﬂuctuated modulator output. We implement a new
deQ method to compensate it.

In our modulator, the pulse forming network, PFN is
charged up resonatorly up to 43 kV. By discharging PFN,
a pulse transformer gains this voltage up to 340 kV with
pulse duration of 7.5 µs and is fed to the klystron.

Figure 1: x and y axe show EPFN and dV/dt respectively.
Even deQ works, EPFN correlates with dV/dt.

deQ module controls the voltage of PFN, EPFN. When
EPFN reaches the reference voltage, deQ modules ﬁres
trigger to stop the charge up. Fig. 1 shows the correla-
tion between EPFN and gradient of the charge up curve,
dV/dt.
Ideally EPFN is independent from dV/dt, but
there is a signiﬁcant correlation. This correlation is ex-
plained as follows; there is some delay to stop charging
up and the delay causes excessive charge up which is ex-
pressed as (dV /dt) × δt where δt is the delay. This excess

is therefore proportional to dV/dt and induces the correla-
tion.

If dV/dt was always same, it was not a problem. In fact,
the amplitude of AC power is unstable and that makes ﬂuc-
tuated dV/dt.
Improving the quality of power source is
straightforward, but it will be rather expensive. Then we
admit the ﬂuctuation of dV/dt and consider to compensate
the EPFN jitter.

feed-forward circuit respectively.

Because dV/dt is ﬂuctuated and δt could not be zero,
then the only way to compensate the ﬂuctuation is to con-
trol δt to keep a constant excessive charge up. Fortunately,
we can measure dV/dt prior to ﬁre deQ signal, then feed-
forward control is possible.

Figure 4: x and y axe show the momentum jitter, ∆P/P
and amplitude of AC 200V line respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the correlation between momentum jitter,
∆P/P and amplitude of AC 200V line. Momentum jitter
was measured in beam transport line where the dispersion
function was large. The dispersion function was calculated
by a software for beam dynamics, so called SAD imple-
mented by KEK scientists. Blue and red(or light and dark)
areas show data taken without and with feed-forward con-
trol respectively. In this plot, we can see a clear depen-
dence of momentum to the amplitude, but it is compensated
by feed-forward deQ. The momentum jitter was decreased
from 0.6% to 0.2% peak-to-peak.

Fig. 5 shows EPFN − dV/dt curve with feed-forward
control. This strange shape can be explained as follows;
although the feed-forward control should be driven by
dV/dt measured at the end of the charge up curve (cot θ),
dV/dt is actually measured at the middle of the charge up
curve(cot θ′). The gain for dV/dt, G is therefore adjusted
like cot θ = G cot θ′ and G cot θ′ is used instead of cot θ.
Due to the sine shape of the charge up curve, the gain G is

a function of deQ timing. Because deQ timing changes

according to dV/dt, then G is a function of dV/dt. On
the other hand, G is a constant in our circuit. As a re-
sult, where dV/dt is large(small), G is too large (small) and
feed-forward control becomes over(under) gain.

To ﬁx the problem, the gain have to be changed accord-
ing to input signal (dV/dt). By introducing a linearizer
to the feed-forward circuit, the gain can be changed con-
tinuously as a function of input signal. A modiﬁed feed-
forward circuit was implemented with three linearizers.
The test is now in progress.

3 PHASE-LOCK SYSTEM

Because the experimental hall where ATF is placed does
not have a good thermal condition, the klystron gallery
temperature is drifted ∼ 1◦C in one day. RF phase is also
drifted 3 − 5◦ of S-band frequency.

To stop the RF phase drift, we have introduced a phase
lock system. The block diagram of the system is shown in
Fig. 6. RF reference distributed through an optical line is

separated into two lines after the phase shifter. One is for
the reference of the phase detector which observes phase
drift at the klystron output. Another is for klystron input
through another phase shifter controlled by the phase-lock
system to absorb klystron phase drift. Feed-back module
gains the phase detector output and cuts the high frequency
component to prevent oscillation of the feed-back loop.

The phase-detector is developed by Nihon-koshuha orig-
inally for KEKB RF system. For our purpose, it was mod-
iﬁed for pulsed RF by adding sample hold circuit. In this
module, phase is measured by taking ExOR of two inputs
gained by limiter ampliﬁers. Due to this logic, output phase
is independent from input RF amplitude. Table 2 shows the
speciﬁcations.

Fig. 7 shows a result of a test for the phase-lock system.
Klystron RF phase was stabilized within 0.2◦ peak-to-peak
by the phase-lock system with the amount of the feed-back
up to 6◦. Accounting for 1◦ systematic error, the klystron
RF phase was stabilized within 1◦. The phase-lock system

4 SUMMARY

To suppress the energy instability of the S-band linac, feed-
forward control deQ was introduced. The momentum jitter
was measured at the beam transport line and was improved
from 0.6% to 0.2% by the feed-forward deQ. For further
improvement, the feed-forward circuit was modiﬁed to cor-
rect the curve shape of dV/dt-EPFN relation by using lin-
earizers.

For the long term phase drift of klystron RF, a phase-
lock system was examined and stabilized the RF phase
within 1◦. The phase-lock system will be introduced for
all klystrons soon.

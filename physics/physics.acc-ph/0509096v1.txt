Abstract

The existence of eﬃcient ion acceleration regimes in collective laser-plasma inter-
actions opens up the possibility to develop high-energy physics facilities in con-
junction with projects for inertial conﬁnement nuclear fusion (ICF) and neutron
spallation sources. In this paper, we show that the pulse compression requests to
make operative these acceleration mechanisms do not fall in contradiction with
current designs for an ICF driver. In particular, we discuss explicitly a solution
that exploits optical parametric chirped pulse ampliﬁcation and the intrinsic
modularity of ICF power plants.

1 Introduction

Particle acceleration through collective short wavelength electromagnetic eﬀects has
been pursued for decades [1]. The advent of laser has made it possible to use the
interaction of the laser light with the charged particles [2] and the plasma [3] and this
technique is still considered a viable alternative to traditional RF-based boosters. Such
a conﬁdence has been strengthened after the advent of wideband oscillators based on
Ti:sapphire and the revolution in power ultrafast lasers due to the development of
Chirped Pulse Ampliﬁcation [4] (CPA). Production of energetic ions and electrons has
been reported by several experimental groups and new breakthroughs are expected
after the commissioning of the next generation of multi-petawatt lasers. Nonetheless,
there is large consensus on the fact that a well-understood and stable regime of ac-
celeration hasn’t been achieved, yet. The lack of a reference mechanism is the root
of the best known drawbacks of laser acceleration: strong dependence on the initial
conditions, large energy spread, poor light-to-particle energy conversion eﬃciency and
signiﬁcant shot to shot variations. These limitations, however, are unlikely to be in-
trinsic features of laser acceleration. This is particularly clear for ion acceleration. It
has long been understood that fast ion generation is related to the presence of hot
electrons [5]. A variety of eﬀects occur when the main source of acceleration is charge
displacement due to the electron motion in the plasma or inductive electric ﬁelds from
2
self generated magnetic ﬁelds [6]. However, for higher laser intensities (1023 W/cm
)
acceleration results from the laser pressure exerted to the comoving electron-ion sys-
tem; the latter acts as a progressively more opaque screen for the laser light and, in
this case, charge displacement only plays the role of rectiﬁer for the transversal laser
ﬁeld and as a medium for electron-ion energy transfer during light absorption. This
mechanism is described in details in [7, 8, 9]. It provides energy transfer eﬃciency com-
parable to RF-based synchrotrons or even cyclotrons and, more importantly, decouples
the ﬁnal ion energy from the accelerated ion current (see Sec.4). If this mechanism
were conﬁrmed experimentally, it could represent the ﬁrst serious alternative to syn-
chrotrons suited for high energy physics (HEP) applications. As noted in [8], a proof of
principle of this radiation-pressure dominated (RPD) acceleration mechanism is at the
borderline of current technology, but the possibility of using this technique to overcome
the limitations of traditional proton accelerators faces many additional diﬃculties. In
particular all present high power lasers operate at very low repetition rate. This is a
classical problem e.g.
in inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF), where the basic principle
could be demonstrated, for instance, at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in US [10]
on a single-shot basis. However, the ultimate use of ICF to produce electric power
will require repetition rates of the order of tens of Hz, an increase of several order of
magnitude compared to the shot rate achievable with state-of-the-art fusion laser tech-
nology. This rate cannot be achieved with ﬂashlamp-pumped neodymium-doped glass
lasers that requires a signiﬁcant interpulse cooling time. There is, currently, a very
large eﬀort to ﬁnd alternative solutions and promising setups based on excimer lasers
or diode-pumped solid state lasers have been identiﬁed, oﬀering, in principle, the repe-

2

tition rates needed for ICF. In [8], we noted that the solution of the problem of thermal
stability and the exploitation of the RPD mechanism would open up the fascinating
possibility of a multipurpose driver for ICF and HEP applications. However, we did
not address explicitly the question whether the power requirements for ICF could fall
in contrast with the pulse compression requests needed for the RPD acceleration to be
fully operative. More precisely, the strong constraints on the choice of the amplifying
medium (and therefore on the gain bandwidth) could make impossible an appropriate
pulse compression, so that the intensity needed to operate in the RPD regime would
not be reached by a multi-pulse device. In this paper we show that there exists at least
one particular conﬁguration that is able to fulﬁll simultaneously the two requirements;
i.e. it oﬀers a high repetition rate device that can be implemented to design a multi-
GeV proton booster with a technology suited for ICF energy production. This solution
is based on the exploitation of optical parametric chirped pulse ampliﬁcation [11, 12]
(OPCPA) and the intrinsic modularity of ICF power plants (see Sec.2); it is described
in details in Sec. 3, while its potentiality as a new generation proton driver is discussed
in Sec. 4

2 Drivers for Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion

Large scale ﬂashlamp-pumped solid state lasers built for ICF are inherently single shot
devices, requiring several hours to recover from thermal distortions. They are aimed
at a proof-of-principle for ICF but their scaling to a cost eﬀective fusion reactor is
highly non trivial. In the last decade, three main research lines have been investigated
and much more eﬀorts will be put in the forecoming years if the proof-of-principle
programs for ICF at NIF or at Laser Megajoule (LMJ) in France is successful. The
ﬁrst one exploits traditional RF-based technologies for ion acceleration to transfer
energy to the target, trigger ignition and sustain burning. This approach proﬁts of
the enormous experience gained in particle accelerators since the 50’s and the large
eﬃciency (∼ 30−35%) obtained at HEP facilities [13] but, as a matter of fact, the mean
intensities and the required uniformity of target illumination are well beyond current
technology. The second and third ones exploit lasers to ignite and sustain fusion and
are aimed at developing systems with much higher thermal yield than Nd:glass. They
are based on diode-pumped solid state lasers (DPSSL) or high power excimer lasers.

2.1 Diode-pumped solid state lasers

The possibility of building ICF lasers with high repetition rates and eﬃciency us-
ing solid state materials mainly relies on the substitution of ﬂashlamps with low-cost
laser diode arrays and the development of crystals for greater energy storage and ther-
mal conductivity than Nd:glass [14]. Yb:crystals cooled by near sonic helium jets are
presently favorite candidates. The main advantage of this approach is that it retains

3

most of the features of Nd:glass systems, ﬁrst of all the possibility (still to be demon-
strated) of < 1% smooth irradiation on-target for direct drive in a timescale of fractions
of ns. A DPSSL-based fusion reactor would be - like NIF - highly modular. One possi-
ble vision is based on 4 kJ DPSSL composed of 1 kJ beamlets operating at a repetition
rate of the order of 10 Hz and assembled to reach the overall MJ power per shot. To our
knowledge, the most advanced R&D project is the Mercury/Venus laser system [15].
In particular, the Mercury R&D is aimed at a 100 J, 10 Hz laser based on gas cooled
Yb:S-FAP crystals grown up to 20 cm diameter [16]. The laser operates at 1047 nm
(1ω) with a 2 ns pulsewidth, a 5x diﬀraction limited beam quality and an eﬃciency
greater than 5%. Fusion drivers are better operated at higher frequencies to increase
the rocket eﬃciency and reduce laser-plasma instabilities [17]. Hence, DPSSL are op-
erated at 3ω (349 nm) with a conversion eﬃciency greater than 80%. Gain bandwidth
is of the order of 5 nm for Yb:S-FAP, signiﬁcantly lower than for Nd:glass (28 nm) so
that the time duration of a DPSSL Fourier-limited (chirp-free) TEM00 output beam
would be bandwidth limited to ∼ 0.3 ps pulses.

2.2 Excimer lasers

Excimer power lasers have been developed both for laser fusion and defense uses. The
current main candidate for ICF is krypton-ﬂuoride. Electron beam pumped KrF sys-
tems oﬀer superior beam spatial uniformity, short wavelength and high laser eﬃciency
(∼ 10%). As for DPSSL, an excimer-based fusion reactor is highly modular and sin-
gle beamlines could provide up to 50 kJ of laser light [17]. Again, the thermal yield
and the eﬃciencies requested for a viable commercial power plant [18] represent major
technological challenges. The laser operates at 248 nm but a certain degree of tun-
ability is oﬀered by the fact that the same system design can be re-used for other gas
mixtures [19] (e.g. ArXe lasing at 1733 nm or XeF at 351 nm). In particular, XeF
has been the leading candidate for defense applications and large aperture lasers with
energy yield per pulse in the 5 kJ range has been built since the late 80’s [20]. XeF
has also been considered for laser fusion but it is less eﬀective than KrF due to its
lower eﬃciency and because it behaves spectrally inhomogeneous, precluding eﬃcient
narrow-band operation [21].

3 OPCPA pulse compression

As a by-product of its peculiar design (see Sec.2), a multi-shot ICF driver oﬀers a
large number of beamlines operating, probably, in the near-UV region with a rather
limited spectral bandwidth and an energy per pulse ranging from 1 to 50 kJ. We do not
expect a Ti:sapphire CPA system being able to use eﬃciently neither this pump source
nor its outstanding average power regime. On the other hand, Optical Parametric
Chirped Pulse Ampliﬁcation oﬀers, in principle, a higher degree of tunability and

4

could be successfully adapted to exploit a narrow band, energetic pump pulse [22]
and its average power [23]. Pulse compression should be enough to trigger the RPD
acceleration mechanism and exploit the high repetition rate to increase the average ion
current.

Optical parametric ampliﬁcation is a nonlinear process that involves a signal wave,
a pump and an idler wave [24]. In a suitable nonlinear crystal, the high intensity and
high frequency pump beam (ωp) ampliﬁes a lower frequency (ωs), lower intensity signal.
Energy conservation is fulﬁlled through the generation of a third beam (“idler”) whose
frequency is constrained by

ωp = ωs + ωi.

(1)

Parametric gain is achieved over the coherence length, deﬁned as the length over which
the phase relationship among the three waves departs from the ideal condition (“phase
matching”). Phase matching corresponds to momentum conservation and can be ex-
pressed as

~kp = ~ks + ~ki,
(2)
~kp, ~ks, ~ki being the wave vectors of pump, signal and idler, respectively. Clearly, en-
ergy and momentum conservation cannot be fulﬁlled simultaneously in a linear crystal
but birefringence oﬀers a way out. In spite of the variety of nonlinear crystals devel-
oped so far for frequency multiplication, only a few can be grown to large size (tens
of cm) to handle the pump energy available and oﬀer an adequate ﬂuence limit for
high power applications. Here, we mainly concentrate on Potassium Dihydrogen Phos-
phate (KDP), a negative uniaxial crystal commonly used for frequency multiplication
of Nd:YAG lasers1. In this case, phase matching can be achieved for parallel beams
(“collinear geometry”) when the pump beam is at an angle θm with respect to the KDP
optical axis:

nep(θm)ωp = nosωs + noiωi.

Note that in the present conﬁguration the pump beam is polarized along the extraor-
dinary direction, while both the signal and the idler beam have ordinary polarization
(“Type I” phase matching). Recalling

It is worth mentioning that θm shows a less pronounced dependence on the wavelength
for Type I phase matching than for type II, i.e. the case when only the idler or the
signal has ordinary polarization [25]. This is an additional advantage when broad
ampliﬁcation bandwidth is sought for.

Fig.1 shows the FWHM ampliﬁcation bandwidth for a KDP-based Type I ampliﬁer
operated in collinear geometry. The bandwidth has been computed assuming a pump
wavelength of 349 nm (see Sec.2) and a pump intensity of 2 GW/cm2. The latter
is determined by the ﬂuence F at which the crystal is operated and the pump pulse
duration τ . Following [12], we assumed here F=1.0 J/cm2 for KDP and τ =0.5 ns 2.
The gain bandwidth has been computed assuming no pump depletion so that the gain
G can be approximated as [12, 26]

the quantity L is the length of the crystal and ∆k ≡ kp − ks − ki is the phase mismatch
among signal, idler and pump. Note that in collinear geometry, this quantity is scalar
since the wave vectors lay along the same axis. def f is the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient:
for Type I phase matching in KDP

def f = −d14 sin θ sin 2φ

(10)

where θ is the angle between the propagation vector and the optic axis and φ is the
azimuthal angle between the propagation vector and the xz crystalline plane3. Hence,
θ = θm and φ can be chosen to maximize def f (φ = π/4). In Fig.1, as well as in Ref. [12],
L has been equalized in order to attain G = 1000. In particular, for λs = 700 nm, such
a gain is reached at L = 2 cm.

Fig.1 points toward the existence of a window for full exploitation of the original
pump power. More precisely, a faint, chirped, wideband seed signal could be ampliﬁed
2In fact, KDP can be operated at higher ﬂuencies since its optical damage threshold is greater than
5 GW/cm2 but no long-term reliability studies are available for these extreme values. Note also that
competing nonlinear processes like self-focusing or self-phase modulations have been neglected.

by a chain of Type I ampliﬁers [27] and ﬁnally enter the power KDP-based ampliﬁer
depleting the intense pump wave4. However, a signiﬁcant improvement in bandwidth
can be achieved operating the system in non-collinear mode. In this case the pump
and signal wave vectors are no more parallel but form an angle α between them. The
angle is independent of the signal wavelength. Again, the idler frequency is ﬁxed by
energy conservation but the emission angle Ω varies with λs. Therefore, the matching
conditions become

∆k|| = kp cos α − ks − ki cos Ω = 0
∆k⊥ = kp sin α − ki sin Ω = 0

The additional degree of freedom coming from the introduction of α can be exploited
to improve the gain bandwidth. In particular, it helps achieving phase matching at
ﬁrst order for small deviations from the central signal wavelength. It corresponds to
imposing [25]

so that the signal/idler angle Ω can be explicitly computed. These derivatives cor-
respond to the group index for signal (ngs = cdks/dωs) and idler (ngs = cdki/dωi).
Hence, Eq.17 can be interpreted as the request for signal group velocity to equal the
projection of idler group velocity along the signal direction. Note that it is impossible
to fulﬁll (17) if the group velocity of the idler is smaller than that of the signal. For
the case under consideration (λp = 349 nm), this generalized matching condition can
be achieved in the signal region between 400 and 700 nm. Fig.2 shows the signal group
velocity as a function of λs = 2πc/ωs (continuous line). The dashed line corresponds
to the idler velocity at ωi = ωp − ωs versus the signal wavelength. Finally, it is possible
to compute the (signal wavelength independent) angle α between the pump and the
signal, which turns out to be

The FWHM bandwidth of the ampliﬁed signal versus λs for a KDP-based Type I ampli-
ﬁer operated in non-collinear geometry is shown in Fig. 3. As for Fig.1, the bandwidth
has been computed assuming a pump wavelength of 349 nm and a pump intensity of
2 GW/cm2. Again, the crystal length L for G=1000 is about 2 cm. Fig.4 shows the
variation of the gain as a function of the wavenumber diﬀerence with respect to the
central wavenumber (1/λs), which the angle α has been tuned for. The continuous
line refers to λs = 550 nm (maximum bandwidth). The dotted and dashed lines refer
to λs = 450 nm and λs = 650 nm, respectively. Figs.3 and 4 represent a key result:
in non-collinear geometry the broadband window for the exploitation of the DPSSL
or XeF drivers corresponds to a signal wavelength of about 550 nm. This region is
accessible by a modelocked Ti:sapphire oscillators (signal generator) after self-phase

modulation [28] and frequency doubling. It provides the seed signal (at the nJ level)
that is ampliﬁed by the chain of low power ampliﬁers5. The pump signal for the low
power ampliﬁers (<5 J) can be either derived by the main pump or, if necessary, by
a dedicated low energy pump at a more appropriate wavelength. Finally, the signal is
sent to the power ampliﬁer operating in pump depletion mode. The studies performed
in 2002 by I. Ross and coauthors [27] indicate that extraction eﬃciencies of the order
of 40% can be obtained. In particular, a 4 kJ pump pulse would provide a broadband
ampliﬁed signal of about 1.6 kJ. The actual light on target depends on the quality of
the ampliﬁed signal and the compression optics and it is discussed in the next section.

4 Proton production and acceleration

The pulse duration that can be achieved after the ampliﬁcation process is dominated, to
ﬁrst order, by the bandwidth of the seed signal and the gain bandwidth of the OPCPA
even if additional eﬀects connected to the beam quality entering the compressor and the
compressor itself should be taken into account. In particular, the spectral phase [26, 27]
generated in an optical parametric ampliﬁcation when the seed signal is chirped plays
a role in setting up the recompression system. For the case under study, the phase Φ
of the ampliﬁed signal is given [26] by

and it is shown in Fig.5 (light line) for the ampliﬁer parameters of Fig.4 and λs =

For this class of spectral chirping [27], nearly ideal recompression can be achieved as
far as cubic phase terms can be compensated. Neglecting the throughput eﬃciency of
the compressor and the losses due to the spectral clipping on the gratings, the output
power P for a Gaussian proﬁle is:

if the bandwidth is dominated by the OPCPA gain bandwidth at λ=550 nm (2200
cm−1). The actual maximum intensity on target depends on the quality of the optics
and the available compressor gratings. Note, however, that operating near diﬀraction
limit is not requested in the present case. In has been shown [7, 8] that RPD accel-
eration mechanism is fully operative for I = 1 × 1023 W/cm
, although the transition
region between the low intensity regimes and the RPD one is presently unexplored both
from the experimental and from the numerical point of view. In the RPD case, the
energy of the accelerated ions depends on the intensity and pulse duration according
to Eq. (17) in Ref.

(21)

[8]

while the number of accelerated ions depends solely on the illuminated area S [8]:
Np = n0Sl0. Here w is proportional to the laser pulse energy, Etot.
It is given by
w = Etot/n0l0mpcS. The eﬃciency of the laser energy transformation into the fast
proton energy is

(22)

(23)

In the ultrarelativistic limit, w ≫ 1,the eﬃciency tends to unity, and it is small in

the nonrelativistic case when w ≪ 1 .

The studies performed in [7] made use of 27 fs (FWHM) gaussian pulses of I =
1.4 × 1023 W/cm2 and, at these intensities, protons are accelerated following an t1/3
asymptotic law up to kinetic energies of ∼ 30 GeV. These numerical studies are ex-
tremely challenging even for large parallel computer facilities. In order to reduce com-
plexity, the study has been carried out with laser pulse of relatively small focal spot.
In addition, the dynamical evolution has been followed up until the t1/3 asymptotic
behaviour is reached (i.e. before the complete laser-plasma decoupling). The overall
laser energy to proton kinetic energy conversion eﬃciency at that time is 40%. Ex-
trapolation up to the time of decoupling indicates that an energy conversion eﬃciency
of 57% can be reached and the maximum kinetic energy for the above parameters ex-
ceeds 30 GeV. In the case under consideration, the illuminated area corresponding to
an intensity on target of I = 1.4 × 1023 W/cm2 is S = 1.5 × 10−10 m2, i.e. a circular
spot of 7 µm radius. Since the kinetic energy reached by the protons is proportional
to the product of intensity and duration, a single shot (7 fs FWHM) would accelerate
particles up to about 8 GeV. The number of accelerated protons Np corresponds to the
energy on target Etot corrected for the laser-to-ion energy transfer eﬃciency (η) divided
by the proton kinetic energy (Ep,kin).

Np =

η Etot

≃ 7 × 1011 protons/pulse

(24)

There is, however, an important caveat to be stressed. The RPD mechanism is fully
operative if the illuminated area is suﬃciently large so that border eﬀects can be
neglected [8]. Due to limited computational resource, a systematic study of the size
and scaling of the border eﬀect is not available at present. Results from [7] indicates
that, at the intensities mentioned above, the border corona has a depth of the order of
5 µm, This implies that either the beamlet arrangement should be able to illuminate
uniformly a relatively large area, as it is done e.g. for the fuel target when the driver
works in ICF mode, or that a signiﬁcant higher energy should be used for the pump
in a proper chain of KDP ampliﬁers. This energy is not used to increase the pump or
the signal intensity but only the surface S, therefore it does not challenge the damage
threshold of the ampliﬁer/compressor components.

From Eq.24, it follows that a single ICF beamline operating at 10 Hz would be
equivalent to a 10 kW proton driver. Clearly, a full ICF facility (2 MJ pump energy
at a repetition rate of 10 Hz) would allow the construction of an extremely ambitious
proton driver in the multi-MW intensity range (see Fig.6). Diﬀerently from traditional
proton drivers, a laser driven device is highly modular, while for RF-based accelera-
tors particles have to be stacked in a single lattice; in the RPD regime the stability
conditions are much less stringent than for traditional drivers since acceleration occurs
nearly instantaneously and not in long periodical structures. Anyway, the possibility
to develop laser fusion in strict connection with particle acceleration represents per se

facilities. The two green lines correspond to a driver obtained by a single 4 kJ beamlet
and by the full ICF facility (2 MJ at 10 Hz rap.rate).

a fascinating research line.

5 Conclusions

If experimentally conﬁrmed, the radiation-pressure dominated (RPD) acceleration mech-
anism [7] will oﬀer a stable and eﬃcient operation regime for laser-driven proton boost-
ers. In particular, it has been emphasized [8] the opportunity to develop these facil-
ities in conjunction with projects for inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) and neutron
spallation sources. In this paper, we have shown for the ﬁrst time that the pulse com-
pression requests to make operative the RPD regime do not fall in contradiction with
the power requests of an ICF driver and we discussed explicitly one solution based on
optical parametric chirped pulse ampliﬁcation (OPCPA). Compatibility regions have
been identiﬁed for OPCPA ampliﬁers based on Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate op-
erated in non collinear mode. In this conﬁguration, bandwidths exceeding 2000 cm−1
(FWHM) have been obtained.

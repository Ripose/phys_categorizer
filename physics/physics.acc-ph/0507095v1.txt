Abstract

An electron-proton/ion collider facility (eRHIC) is under
consideration at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).
Such a new facility will require the design and construction
of a new optimized detector proﬁting from the world’s ﬁrst
ep collider facility HERA at DESY. The detailed design is
closely coupled to the design of the interaction region and
thus to the machine development work in general. Implica-
tions and constraints on the ep(A) interaction-region design
will be discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The high energy, high intensity polarized elec-
tron/positron beam (5 − 10 GeV/10 GeV) facility (eRHIC)
to collide with the existing RHIC heavy ion (100 GeV per
nucleon) and polarized proton beam (50 − 250 GeV) would
signiﬁcantly enhance the exploration of fundamental as-
pects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the underlying
quantum ﬁeld theory of strong interactions. A detailed re-
port on the accelerator and interaction region design of this
new collider facility has been completed based on studies
performed jointly by BNL and MIT-Bates in collaboration
with BINP and DESY [1].

OUTLINE OF THE eRHIC DETECTOR
DESIGN

The following discussion will be restricted to the nom-
inal eRHIC collider mode operation of a 10 GeV elec-
tron/positron beam colliding with a 250 GeV proton beam.
Simple four vector kinematics in e-p collisions which in-
volves an electron and a proton in the initial state and a
scattered electron along with a hadronic ﬁnal state in the
ﬁnal state can be used to study analytically the energy and
angular acceptance of the scattered electron and hadronic
ﬁnal state as a function of the main kinematic quantities
in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), x and Q2 [3]. This pro-
vides a ﬁrst understanding of the ﬁnal state topology. Q2 is
the negative four momentum transfer squared between the
incoming and scattered electron. The Bjorken scaling vari-
able x is interpreted in the Quark-Parton model as the frac-
tion of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark.
The hadronic ﬁnal state consists of the current jet which
emerges from the struck quark characterized by its polar
angle and energy.

Figure 1: The dashed line represents lines of constant y
values (1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001). The electron beam energy
amounts to 10 GeV whereas the proton beam energy is
250 GeV. Isolines of constant electron energies (4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 14, 16, 20 and 40GeV) (a), electron scattering angles
(30◦ - 150◦ in steps of 30◦ and 170◦, 175◦, 177◦ and 179◦)
(b), current jet energies (4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, 40 and
100GeV) (c) and current jet angles (3◦, 30◦-150◦ in steps
of 30◦ and 170◦, 175◦, 177◦ and 179◦) (d).

Figure 1 shows isolines of constant electron energy (a)
and scattering angle (b) as well as lines of constant y values
(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001). The kinematic variable y is given in
terms of x and Q2 (y = Q2/(sx)) and refers to the inelas-
ticity in the rest frame of the proton. The kinematic limit
is given by y = 1. The scattering angle is measured with
respect to the incoming proton beam which deﬁnes the pos-
itive z axis. Electron tagging acceptance down to at least
177◦ will be necessary to provide acceptance in Q2 down to
0.1 GeV2. The energy of the scattered electron is less than
10 GeV for a large fraction of the kinematic region and is
in particular small in the region of low x and medium to
low values in Q2. This sets stringent requirements on trig-
ger and reconstruction efﬁcienies. Figure 1 shows isolines
of constant current jet energy (c) and scattering angle (d).
The energy of the current jet is rather small in the low x

and medium to low Q2 region and overlaps to some extend
with the scattered electron. This will require e/h separa-
tion in particular in the rear direction, i.e. the direction of
larger electron scattering angles with respect to the incom-
ing proton beam. The current jet energy increases towards
the forward direction in the region of high x and Q2 values.
The capability to measure larger jet energies will be in par-
tiuclar important in the forward direction, i.e. the incoming
proton beam direction.

The following minimal requirements on a future eRHIC

detector can be made:

• Measure precisely the energy and angle of the scat-

tered electron (Kinematics of DIS reaction)

• Measure hadronic ﬁnal state (Kinematics of DIS reac-
tion, jet studies, ﬂavor tagging, fragmentation studies,
particle ID)

• Missing transvere energy measurement (Events in-
volving neutrinos in the ﬁnal state, electro-weak
physics)

In addition to those demands on a central detector, the

following forward and rear detector systems are crucial:

• Zero-degree photon detector to control radiative cor-
rections and measure Bremsstrahlung photons for lu-
minosity measurements

• Tag electrons under small angles (Study of the non-
perturbative/perturbative QCD transition region and
luminosity measurements from Bremsstrahlung ep
events)

• Tagging of forward particles (Diffraction and nuclear

fragments)

Optimizing all the above requirements is a challenging
task. Two detector concepts have been considered so far.
One, which focuses on the forward acceptance and thus
on low-x/high-x physics which emerges out of HERA-III
detector studies [5]. This detector concept is based on a
compact system of tracking and central electromagnetic
calorimetry inside a magnetic dipole ﬁeld and calorimet-
ric end-walls outside. Forward produced charged particles
are bent into the detector volume which extends the rapidity
coverage compared to existing detectors. A side view of the
detector arrangment is shown in Figure 2. The required ma-
chine element-free region amounts to roughly ±5m. This
clearly limits the achieveable luminosity in a ring-ring con-
ﬁguration.

The second design effort focuses on a wide acceptance
detector system similar to the current HERA collider exper-
iments H1 and ZEUS to allow for the maximum possible
Q2 range. The physics program demands high luminos-
ity and thus focusing machine elements in a ring-ring con-
ﬁguration which are as close as possible to the interaction
region while preserving good central detector acceptance.
This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
A simulation and reconstruction package called ELECTRA
has been developed to design a new eRHIC detector at BNL

physics with a 7 m long dipole ﬁeld and an interaction re-
gion without machine elements extending from −3.8 m to
+5.8 m.

[4]. Figure 3 shows a side view of a GEANT detector im-
plementation of the above requirements on a central detec-
tor. The hermetic inner and outer tracking system including
the electromagnetic section of the barrel calorimeter is sur-
rounded by an axial magnetic ﬁeld. The forward calorime-
ter is subdivided into hadronic and electromagnetic sec-
tions based on a conventional lead-scintillator type. The
rear and barrel electromagnetic consists of segmented tow-
ers, e.g. a tungsten-silicon type. This would allow a fairly
compact conﬁguration. Other options based on a crystal
rear and barrel electromagnetic calorimeter are under study.
The inner most double functioning dipole and quadrupole
magnets are located at a distance of ±3m from the inter-
action region. An initial interaction region design assumed
those inner most machine elements at ±1m. This would
signiﬁcantly impact the detector acceptance and is there-
fore not considered. More details on the interaction region
design can be found in [1].

tion as part of the ELECTRA simulation and reconstruc-
tion package [4]. A deep-inelastic scattering event result-
ing from a LEPTO simulation is overlayed with Q2 =
361 GeV2 and x = 0.45.

The bunch crossing frequency amounts to roughly
30 MHz. This sets stringent requirements on the high-rate
capabililty of the tracking system. This makes a silicon-
type detector for the inner tracking system (forward and
rear silicon disks together with several silicon barrel lay-
ers) together with several GEM-type outer tracking layers

Rear tagging system

The need for acceptance of scattered electrons beyond
the central detector acceptance is driven by the need for
luminosity measurements through ep/eA Bremstrahlung
and photo-production physics. Besides that a calorimeter
setup to tag radiated photons from inital-state radiation and
Bremsstrahlung will be necessary. The scattered electrons
will pass through the machine elements and leave the beam
pipe through special exist windows. The simulation of var-
ious small-angle calorimeter setups has been started. This
will require a close collaboration with the eRHIC machine
design efforts to aim for an optimal detector setup.

Forward tagging system

The forward tagging system beyond the central detector
will play a crucial role in diffractive ep/eA physics. The de-
sign of a forward tagger system based on forward calorime-
try and Roman pot stations is foreseen. Charged particles
will be deﬂected by forward machine elements. This effort
will require as well a close collaboration with the eRHIC
machine design efforts to ensure the best possible forward
detector acceptance.

a potential choice. The forward and rear detector systems
have not been considered so far. The design and location
of those detector systems has to be worked out in close
collaboration to accelerator physicists since machine mag-
nets will be potentially employed as sepectrometer mag-
netes and thus determine the actual detector acceptance and
ultimately the ﬁnal location. It is understood that demands
on optimizing the rear/forward detector acceptance might
have consequences on the machine layout and is therefore
an iterative process.

CONSIDERATIONS ON THE
DETECTOR/MACHINE INTERFACE

The following section provides an overview of some as-
pects of the detector/machine interface. The speciﬁcation
of those items has only recently been started:

Synchrotron radiation

The direct synchrotron radiation has to pass through the
entire interaction region before hitting a rear absorber sys-
tem. This requires that the geometry of the beam pipe is de-
signed appropriately with changing shape along the longi-
tudinal beam direction which includes besides a simulation
of the mechanical stress also the simulation of a cooling
system of the inner beam pipe. The beam pipe design has
to include in addidition the requirement to maximize the
detector acceptance in the rear and forward direction. Fur-
thermore the amount of dead material has to be minimized
in particular to limit multiple scattering (track reconstruc-
tion) and energy loss for particles under shallow angles (en-
ergy reconstruction). The distribution of backscattered syn-
chrotron radiation into the acutal detector volume has to be
carefully evaluated. An installation of a collimator system
has to be worked out. Those items have been started in
close contact to previous experience at HERA [6].

Location of inner machine elements

The demand of a high luminosity ep/eA collider facil-
ity requires the installaton of focusing machine elements
as close as possible to the central detector. An interac-
tion region design with machine elements as close ±1 m
to the interaction region which has been presented in [1]
would signiﬁcantly limit the achievable detector accep-
tance. A new scheme has been presented in [2] which
provides a machine-element free region of ±3 m at the ex-
pense of approximatley half the luminosity for the inter-
action region design presented in [1]. A linac-ring option
would not be limited by beam-beam effects compared to a
ring-ring conﬁguration. Even larger luminosities could be
achieved with a machine-element free region of approxi-
matley ±5 m. This scheme has been presented in [7].

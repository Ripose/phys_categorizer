Executive Summary

Recent evidence from atmospheric, solar, and accelerator neutrinos sug-
gests that neutrinos have mass, and mix among the ﬂavors νe, νµ and ντ .
Neutrino mass is evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model, and has
cosmological implications.

Because neutrinos interact so weakly, unusual eﬀorts are required to de-
tect them. Although many of the recent, exciting results in neutrino physics
have been obtained by non-accelerator techniques, the neutrino mass and
mixing parameters appear to be such that a new generation of accelerator
experiments with long baseline distance to the detectors can perform de-
tailed measurements. For this, a new source of well-characterized neutrinos
is needed.

We are exploring the feasibility of a neutrino factory based on a muon
storage ring. In this, beams of νµ and νe arise from the decay of µ− particles
(or alternatively, νµ and νe from µ+). The muons come from the decay
of low-energy pions produced by a megawatt proton beam incident on a
nuclear target. The muons are captured into a magnetic channel, “cooled”
by ionization in liquid hydrogen, accelerated to energy of order 50 GeV, and
injected into a storage ring. A nonhorizontal ring can deliver neutrino beams
to an on-site detector, as well as to two oﬀ-site detectors separated by global
distances.

Such a neutrino factory is a challenging extension of present accelerator
technology. It is also a natural path to a muon collider, in that both facilities
share many common elements upstream of their storage rings. Prior to a
formal design study, R&D must be performed in several keys areas, such
detailed simulations and actual targetry and cooling experiments. This in
an excellent opportunity to advance the ﬁeld of accelerator physics both at
national laboratories and at universities.

1 Introduction

There is accumulating evidence for massive neutrinos that mix among ﬂavors. The strongest
indication is the atmospheric neutrino anomaly ﬁrst observed by the Kamiokande [1] and
IMB [2] detectors, conﬁrmed by the Soudan-2 [3] and MACRO [4] detectors, and recently
measured with high statistics by the Super-Kamiokande detector [5]. In addition, the long-
standing deﬁciency of the solar neutrino ﬂux measured by the Homestake chlorine experiment
[6] is now supported by data from the Kamiokande [7], Super-Kamiokande [8], GALLEX [9],
and SAGE [10] detectors. These data suggest neutrino masses in the range <∼ 0.1 eV for the
mass eigenstates νi, i = 1, 2, 3 whose linear combinations comprise the neutrinos νe, νµ, and
ντ . Such neutrinos would not be a signiﬁcant part of the dark matter of the universe,

The LSND experiment at Los Alamos has reported evidence of νµ − νe oscillations [11],
although so far this has not been conﬁrmed by a similar experiment, KARMEN, at Ruther-
ford [12]. If conﬁrmed, this results appears to require the existence of one or more light,
sterile neutrinos which could be an important component of hot, dark matter.

The issue of neutrino mass has spawned a new “industry” [13], resulting in about three
new preprints per day [14], among other activities. Excitement is high in the accelerator
physics community because the physics implied by the atmospheric-neutrino results is ac-
cessible to long-baseline accelerator experiments such as K2K [15], Minos [16] and NGS [17].
Of course, the LSND experiment was conducted at a short-baseline accelerator facility, and
can be conﬁrmed by future accelerator experiments such as MiniBooNE [18], ORLanD [19],
and CERN P311 [20]. Moreover, even the physics associated with many of the interpreta-
tions of the solar-neutrino deﬁcit is accessible to study in accelerator-based experiments if
neutrino-beam ﬂuxes can be improved by 1-2 orders of magnitude.

To obtain a factor of 100 improvement in neutrino ﬂux in a cost-eﬀect manner, a new
approach is called for. The best prospect appears to be neutrino beams derived from a muon
storage ring, rather than from pion and kaon decay, although the concept of muon-based
neutrino beams needs considerable development before it can be realized in the laboratory.
Muon storage rings have been discussed since at least 1960 [21], and their possible ap-
plication to neutrino physics was considered as early as 1980 [22]. However, storage rings
with enough circulating muons to provide more high-energy neutrinos than from horn beams
have been only recently been considered in the context of muon colliders [23]. Enthusiasm
for muon-based neutrino beams has been fostered by a series of workshops and studies at
Fermilab [24], BNL [25], and CERN [26], resulting in a convergence of international interest
at the NuFact’99 Workshop [27, 28].

The neutrino ﬂuxes from these proposed muon-based beams are higher than ever achieved
before, with a better-understood ﬂavor composition, and, since the neutrino beams from this
source would be secondary beams rather than tertiary beams, they are more collimated than
ever previously imaginable. Distances between production and detection can now span the
globe, and using the known ﬂavor composition of the beam, one can map out a plan to
measure the neutrino oscillation mixing matrix including CP violating eﬀects, much like
that now underway to study the CKM quark mixing matrix.

We present a brief review of the physics of neutrino oscillations in sec. 2, also including
detector issues most critical for neutrino oscillation measurements. As an example of how
diverse a neutrino program at a storage ring could be, highlights of possible nucleon structure

1

and other near-detector measurements are given in sec. 3. The machine itself is discussed
in sec. 4, and its possible extension to a muon collider is considered in sec. 5. The active
theme of this document, research and development towards the design of a neutrino factory,
is discussed in sec. 6.

2 Neutrino Oscillations

2.1

Interpretations of the Data

The concept of neutrino oscillation was introduced in 1957 [29] and has been extensively
discussed in the literature [30] and now on the internet [31]. In the example of only two
massive neutrinos, with mass eigenstates ν1 and ν2 with mass diﬀerence ∆m and mixing
angle θ, the ﬂavor eigenstates are

The probability that a neutrino of ﬂavor νa and energy E appears as ﬂavor νb after traversing
distance L in vacuum is

As the atmospheric neutrino data involves GeV muon neutrinos with distance scales of
the Earth’s diameter, this suggests ∆m2 of order 10−3 (eV)2 for sin2 2θ ≈ 1 [32]. The solar
neutrino data involves MeV electron neutrinos and distance scales of the radius of the Earth’s
orbit, suggesting ∆m2 of order 10−10 (eV)2 with sin2 2θ ≈ 1 for vacuum oscillations [33]. The
LSND result involves 30-MeV muon antineutrino and a distance scale of 30 m, suggesting
∆m2 of order 1 (eV)2; large mixing angles are excluded by reactor data [34], so sin2 2θ can
only be of order 10−2 in this case.

Clearly, four diﬀerent massive neutrinos are required to accommodate all three results,
given their disparate scales of ∆m2. The Standard Model presently includes only three
neutrinos with standard electroweak couplings and mν < mZ/2, so a “sterile” neutrino is
required if all the data are correct [35]. Even discarding the LSND result, three massive
neutrinos are required with a corresponding 3 × 3 mixing matrix (MNS matrix) [36], one of
whose representations is, where c12 = cos θ12, etc.,

In the model of three massive neutrinos, the neutrino oscillation probabilities of interest
depend on six measurable parameters: three mixing angles (θ12, θ13, θ23), and a phase δ re-
lated to CP violation as indicated in eq. (3); and two diﬀerences of the squares of the neutrino

12| ≪ |∆m2

The description of the atmospheric neutrino data requires ∆m2

23 ≈ (2 − 6) × 10−3 eV2
and large mixing angle θ23: sin2 2θ23 ≈ (0.9 − 1.0). For |∆m2
23| and with ∆m2
23
having a value in the above range, the nonobservation of oscillations of the reactor electron
antineutrinos in the CHOOZ experiment [38] implies a limit on the angle θ13: sin2 θ13 <
0.05. Given these constraints, the transitions/oscillations of the solar neutrinos in the three-
neutrino mixing scheme under discussion depend largely on just two parameters: ∆m2
12 and
sin2 2θ12.

12| ≪ |∆m2

13| ≈ |∆m2

23|.

The presence of matter can strongly modify the oscillations of electron neutrinos due to
their charged-current interaction (MSW eﬀect [37]):
in particular, the oscillations can be
resonantly enhanced by the matter eﬀects even when the oscillation probabilities are small
in vacuum. This leads to additional interpretations of the solar neutrino data in which ∆m2
12
can be of order 10−5 (eV)2 [39]. Indeed, there are four presently viable interpretations of the
solar neutrino data:

• Vacuum oscillation (VO) solution with ∆m2

12 ≈ (0.5 − 5.0) × 10−10 eV2 and sin2 2θ12 ≈

• Low MSW solution corresponding to ∆m2

12 ≈ (0.5 − 2.0) × 10−7 eV2 and sin2 2θ12 ≈

(0.7 − 1.0),

(0.9 − 1.0),

• Small mixing angle (SMA) MSW solution with ∆m2

12 ≈ (4.0 − 9.0) × 10−6 eV2 and

sin2 2θ12 ≈ (0.001 − 0.01),

• Large mixing angle (LMA) MSW solution, ∆m2

12 ≈ (0.2−2.0)×10−4 eV2 and sin2 θ12 ≈

(0.65 − 0.96).

For the VO, Low, and SMA MSW solutions, the expressions for the various transition/oscillation
probabilities at distances which can be reached on earth simplify: they reduce essentially to
the two-neutrino mixing expressions. Neglecting the possible matter eﬀects for simplicity,
we can write them in the form

P (νe → νµ) = sin2(2θ13) sin2(θ23) sin2

P (νe → ντ ) = sin2(2θ13) cos2(θ23) sin2

P (νµ → ντ ) = cos4(θ13) sin2(2θ23) sin2

In the case of the large-mixing-angle (LMA) MSW solution there is a known small but
non-negligible correction in the above expressions due to the ∆m2

12.

Another type of interpretation is often made of these data, in which the mass m of a light
neutrino is related to an intermediate mass scale mI and an heavy mass scale mH according
to the “seesaw” mechanism [40] which predicts

m =

m2
I
mH

.

(7)

There remains considerable ﬂexibility in the choice of these mass scales, but a particularly
suggestive version [41] invokes the vacuum expectation value, 250 GeV, of the Higgs ﬁeld as
∆m2(atmospheric) ≈ 0.06 eV yields mH ≈
the intermediate mass, so that estimating m ≈
5×1015 GeV. This scale is commonly associated with the supersymmetric uniﬁcation scale in
SO(10) models. Hence, there is optimism that neutrino mass is evidence that supersymmetry
exists at the GUT scale. Only a small additional dose of optimism is required to expect that
the supersymmetric partners of known particles have masses near the intermediate scale,
mI ≈ 250 GeV, and will be found during the next decade.

2.2 The Next Generation of Neutrino Experiments

With four interpretations of the solar neutrino data, and the two interpretations of the LSND
data as either right or wrong, there are a total of eight scenarios for explanations of the data.
The experimental challenge is to reduce these to a unique scenario, and to make accurate
measurements of the parameters of that scenario.

It is likely that the next generation of short-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments
mentioned previously [18, 19, 20] will clarify the status of the LSND result within 5 years.
Continued operation of Super-Kamiokande, plus the new long-baseline mentioned previ-
ously [15, 16, 17] will ﬁrm up the physics closely associated with the atmospheric neutrino
anomaly over the next decade, but will have limited ability to explore more than a two-
neutrino interpretation.

The solar neutrino spectrum is complex, and all interpretations of the solar neutrino
deﬁcit invoke fortuitous energy dependence in the models. This should permit new critical
tests of these models as new detectors come into operation with diﬀerent energy sensitivities.
Super-Kamiokande and the SNO experiment [42] (which has just started operation) have
good sensitivity to higher-energy solar neutrinos, whose ﬂux is predicted to rise with energy
in the “just-so” models. However, precise interpretation may be elusive here even with
improved statistics, due to uncertainties in the production rate of hep neutrinos in the Sun.
These high-statistics experiments will also provide more-signiﬁcant tests of the depen-
dence of oscillation rates on varying path length (seasonal variation) implied in the “just-so”
models, and on traversal of varying amounts of matter (day/night eﬀect) which aﬀect some
of the MSW solutions.

At the other end of the energy spectrum, the BOREXino liquid scintillator experiment

[43] should be sensitive to the 0.8-MeV 7B neutrinos.

Even more ambitious projects, HELLAZ [45] and HERON [44], plan to use cryogenic
techniques to lower their sensitivities to below the 0.4-MeV maximum of the pp neutrinos
whose numbers dominate the solar neutrino spectrum.

A qualitatively diﬀerent phenomenon accessible to the SNO experiment is the comparison
of the rates of the reactions ν+2H → p + p + e and ν+2H → p + n + ν. The ﬁrst reaction

4

can only proceed via an electron neutrino, while any neutrino ﬂavor can initiate the second.
Hence, if solar electron neutrinos have indeed transformed to other ﬂavors, the ratio of
reaction rates will be less than one. Such a result will be unambiguous evidence for neutrino
oscillations by itself.

This extensive program of solar neutrino experiments will certainly greatly constrain the
four present interpretations of the solar neutrino data over the next decade, although one
cannot predict with certainty that only a single interpretation will then remain.

None of the experiments discussed thus far addresses the long-standing question of
whether neutrinos, if massive, are Dirac neutrinos (with particles and antiparticles being
diﬀerent: ν 6= ν) or Majorana neutrinos (with particles and antiparticles the same, as for
photons: ν = ν) [46]. Theoretically, Majorana neutrinos are more “natural”, but the ques-
tion should be settled experimentally. This is extremely diﬃcult because neutrinos are always
(thus far) produced in weak interactions with a unique helicity, which provides a practical
distinction between neutrino and antineutrino even if there is none in principle.
Instead,
experimental resolution of the question is based on the search for neutrinoless double beta
decay, (A,Z → (A,Z + 2) + 2e−, which can proceed via annihilation of virtual νe and νe as
permitted for Majorana, but not for Dirac, neutrinos. The present (model dependent) limit
based on nonobservation of such a decay of 76Ge is that m < 0.1 eV for Majorana neutrinos.
This limit may be pushed as low as 0.001 eV in the next decade.

2.3 The Opportunity for a Neutrino Factory

Now that there are rough experimental guidelines as to the parameters of neutrino masses
and mixings, one can begin to plan for more extensive studies than those described in the
previous section. Two prominent features of such a plan are the need for more neutrinos,
and that accelerator experiments with GeV-energy neutrinos can probe a large fraction of
the relevant parameter space.

The need for more GeV-energy neutrinos leads to a need for GeV proton sources in
the megawatt power range. Such power sources, when available, could be used to produce
neutrinos via horn beams in the conventional manner. However, an option has emerged with
greater physics ﬂexibility while maintaining a comparable or even larger ν/p ratio than that
from horn beams. Namely, neutrino beams derived from the decay of muons in a storage
ring. Technical aspects of muon-based neutrino beams are discussed in sec. 4. Here, we
review the physics opportunities with such beams.

Both µ− and µ+ can be stored in the ring, but only one sign will be used at a time.

When, say, µ− are stored their decay,

µ− → e− νµ νe,
leads to beams that contain nearly equal numbers of νµ and νe with spectra that are extremely
well known.

(8)

At the detectors, the neutrino and the antineutrino may or may not have changed their
ﬂavor, leading to the appearance of a diﬀerent ﬂavor or the disappearance of the initial
ﬂavor, respectively. When detected by a charged-current interaction, there are 6 classes of
signatures in a three-neutrino model:

νµ → νe → e−

A similar list of processes can be written for operation with positive muons.

Of special interest is process (13) where a muon of sign diﬀerent from the parent muon
appears. This is a unique feature of the neutrino factories based on muon beams since they
are the only sources of intense high energy electron (anti)neutrino beams.

The cases (11) and (14) of τ appearance are only practical for neutrino beams with 10’s

of GeV energy.

2.3.1 Measurements of Masses and Mixing Angles

First, the high ﬂux of neutrinos coming from the decay ring is ideal to measure precisely
the various neutrino cross sections and to explore scenarios with more than three massive
neutrinos, using a compact detector located at a short distance.

By the time a muon storage ring would be built it is expected that two angles θ23 and
θ12, and the magnitudes of two mass squared diﬀerences ∆m2
12 would be known.
This knowledge would come from the solar and atmospheric neutrino measurements which
would have been veriﬁed by long baseline and reactor experiments, for example, MINOS
and KamLAND. The remaining pieces of the puzzle would be θ13, the CP-violating phase
δ and the signs of the ∆m2
ij. In addition, the indicated long-baseline experiments will not
be sensitive to the matter eﬀects in neutrino oscillations because the distances between the
sources and detectors are not suﬃciently large. It would be of fundamental importance to
verify experimentally the existence of matter eﬀects in neutrino oscillations by observing
directly the modiﬁcation of the neutrino oscillation probabilities by these eﬀects.

23 and ∆m2

The third mixing angle θ13 can be measured in several channels at a neutrino factory
[47], as can be seen from the expressions (4)-(6) for various transition probabilities. The
detector must be far to avoid background but not too far (< 1000 km) so that the eﬀects of
∆m2
12 remain negligible and thus δ can formally be set to zero. Figure 1 shows the achievable
sensitivity to the yet-unknown value of θ13.

2.3.2 Measurement of CP Violation

The measurement of δ in a three-neutrino scenario [48] relies either on CP violation through
the expression

or on time-reversal violation using

ACP =

P (νe → νµ) − P (νe → ν µ)
P (νe → νµ) + P (νe → νµ)

,

AT =

P (νe → νµ) − P (νµ → νe)
P (νe → νµ) + P (νµ → νe)

.

Figure 1: Sensitivity reach in the (sin2 θ13, ∆m2
23) plane for a 10 kton detector
and a neutrino beam from 2 × 1020 decays of 20 GeV muons in a storage ring
at distance 732 km. The appearance process νe → νµ → µ+, shown by the
lines on the left, has much greater sensitivity than the disappearance process
νµ → νµ → µ−, shown by the lines on the right. The interior of the box is the
approximate region allowed by Super-Kamiokande data (hep-ph/9811390).

The asymmetry (15) can be measured using wrong-sign muons and the two polarities of the
muon beam. However, the genuine CP violating contribution to (15) due to a nonvanishing
phase δ competes with terms related to matter eﬀects, i.e., to the diﬀerent rates of scattering
of νe and νe between source and detector. The relative strength of the matter-induced
asymmetry increases quadratically with distance, and dilutes the signal of CP violation in a
far detector.

If the solution of the solar neutrinos problem is that involving large mixing angles and
matter enhancement (LMA MSW, sin2 2θ12 ≈ sin2 2θ23 ≈ 1), then there is a possibility of
measuring the CP violating asymmetry (15), whose value is then

provided the detector is located suﬃciently far and high statistics (> 1021 muons per year) are
available. For all the other solar neutrino solutions ACP is extremely small, being suppressed
by a factor of either sin2 2θ12 or ∆m2
12. Figure 2 illustrates the experimental sensitivity to
in a large angle MSW scenario.

(corresponding to maximal CP violation). The dashed curves ignore matter
eﬀects, while the solid curves include them; the matter eﬀects dominate the
asymmetry for distances beyond 1000 km. The lower (upper) curves are for
Eµ = 20 (50) GeV. From hep-ph/9909254.

The asymmetry (16) is not sensitive to matter eﬀects, but relies on distinguishing the
process νµ → νe → e− from ν e → ν e → e+. It will be very diﬃcult to distinguish electrons
from positrons in the detector, but the relative νµ and νe ﬂuxes can be varied by varying the
polarization of the muons in the storage ring [49].

If future experiments conﬁrm the interpretation of the LSND data that more than three
massive neutrinos exist, then the use of the ﬂavor-rich beams of a neutrino factory is even
more of an imperative because the parameter space for CP/T violating eﬀects is considerably
enlarged and can be successfully explored in experiments with such beams [50].

2.3.3 Detector Issues

In view of the various experimental signatures (9)-(14), an ideal detector would provide
identiﬁcation of both ﬂavor and charge of all three leptons e, µ, and τ . Muons are the
easiest to identify, τ ’s are the next easiest if only because of their decay to muons, and ﬁnally
electrons are the most diﬃcult. Fortunately, there is a very rich program for detectors that
only measure the charge of muons, and hence the oscillation processes (10) and (13) and
their conjugates.

Baseline Detector Capability

A magnetized steel/scintillator sampling calorimeter would be one of the far detectors at a
Ehad[GeV],

muon storage ring experiment. It could have a hadron energy resolution of 0.76/

a hadron angular resolution of 17/
and angular resolution.

q

Ehad[GeV]+12/Ehad[GeV], and much better muon energy

q

The largest forseeable background in such a detector is charm production. The appear-
ance signal for process (13) is a “wrong-sign” muon. However, if there is enough energy for
charm production in process (10), the charmed particle produced will decay 10% of the time
to a wrong-sign muon in the ﬁnal state. There is a chance that the associated muon from
the neutrino interaction vertex is low energy and/or undetected. With kinematic cuts on the
muon momentum and its component transverse to the hadronic shower, the signal eﬃciency
would be reduced by 25 to 30%, but the backgrounds would be reduced by a factor of 10−5
to 10−6 depending on the neutrino energy. The rejection rate improves faster with energy
than does the background, favoring the use of higher energy muons in the storage ring.

Thus, such a baseline detector would be suﬃcient for measurements of θ13 via process
(13), and the CP-violating phase δ via the asymmetry (15), both of which are unlikely to be
measured elsewhere and would contribute enormously to the ﬁeld.

Measurement of the T-violating asymmetry (16) requires separation of process (9) from
(12), ideally performed by measuring the sign of the electron, and both of these from neutral-
current scattering oﬀ electrons. Depending on the transverse and longitudinal segmentation
of the scintillator, electron identiﬁcation is possible, although not on an event-by-event ba-
sis. Electron-neutrino charged-current interactions would be distinguished on average by
an energy deposition that was much closer to the neutrino interaction vertex, and at an
angle with respect to the outgoing hadronic shower. Charge identiﬁcation would not be
possible, although from varying the polarization of the muon beam one could see how many
electron-like events were from ν e’s, and how many were from νµ’s [49].

Since a muon-based neutrino factory is a pulsed device with a small duty factor, cosmic-
ray backgrounds will be relatively unimportant. Hence, there is the option to locate the
detectors at the surface of the Earth, where available infrastructure is more favorable for
very large devices.

Finally, such a baseline detector would have modest detection eﬃciency for τ ’s via their
decay to µ’s, permitting study of process (11) and (14) if suﬃciently large numbers of
neutrinos are available.

Beyond the Baseline Detector

Additional technologies must be employed to achieve electron and τ identiﬁcation and

charge measurement on an event-by-event basis.

One category of new detectors uses thin (∼ 100 µm) sheets of emulsion combined with
thin (∼ 300 µm) lead or steel spacers to measure kinks that occur when a τ decays. MINOS
is studying the performance of this geometry combined with steel for τ appearance mea-
surements and is likely to install such a device if they do see oscillations. By comparing the
change in slope between a few hundred of these sheets, one could make a 4-σ event-by-event
measurement on electron or τ charge. This technique is practical only in relatively small
volumes, and is perhaps best suited for the near detector, or for the extraordinarily well

9

collimated neutrino beams from a TeV muon collider.

Detectors which have slightly more promise for use on the 10-kton scale identify τ → µ
decays by their diﬀerence in kinematics, although they don’t see the kink from the decay
itself. ICARUS, which uses a Liquid Argon TPC detector, has the necessary charged track
resolution to measure the acoplanarity of an event and determine the likelihood of its being
a τ candidate.

3 Precision High-Rate Neutrino Physics

The advent of a muon storage ring would not only bring about new neutrino oscillation
measurements, but would also usher in a new era for high-precision neutrino scattering
experiments [51]. For example, with a detector located 30 m from a 150 m straight section
of a 50-GeV, 1021-µ/yr muon storage ring, the event rate is 40 million events per kilogram
per year over a 10 cm radius.

To assist in the interpretation of oscillation-related measurements, precision measure-
ments would be made of the total neutrino and antineutrino cross sections, as well as of the
beam divergence.

The neutrinos would also be used as precision probes of nuclear and nucleon structure,
providing additional information to that obtained in related study using charged lepton
beams. As is well known, neutrino scattering allows a clean separation of the valence and
sea quark distributions, and use of a polarized target permits characterization of the spin
dependence of these distributions. The near detector is thus the natural successor to nu-
cleon structure measurements now underway at HERA, HERMES, Jeﬀerson Lab, RHIC and
elsewhere.

Combined analysis of the scattering of the four neutrino types νµ, ν µ, νe, and νe oﬀ
electrons should permit measurement of the Weinberg angle ten times better than presently
known.

A high-ﬂux multi-GeV neutrino beam is also a charm factory, in which a νµ beam leads
only to c quarks that are tagged by a ﬁnal-state µ− (νµd → µ−c), while νµ beam leads only
to tagged c quarks. For the beam parameters described above, there would be 107 leptonic
tagged charm decays in only 40 kg-years (not kton-years!), permitting measurements of Vcd
to fraction of a percent, and perhaps even direct observation of D0 − D

mixing.

4 A Neutrino Factory

Relatively complete sketches of a neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring have emerged
only recently via a convergence of earlier visions during the NuFact’99 workshop [27, 28].
Here, we present recent scenarios that consider BNL and FNAL sites as examples [52], but
note that the conceptual details of a neutrino factory are evolving rapidly.

4.1

Introduction

Conventional neutrino beams employ a proton beam on a target to generate pions, which
are focused and allowed to decay into neutrinos and, incidentally, muons [53]. The muons

10

are discarded (stopped in shielding) and the neutrinos (νµ) are directed to the detector. In
a neutrino factory, pions are made the same way and allowed to decay, but it is the decay
muons that are captured and used. The initial neutrinos from pion decay are discarded, or
used in a parasitic low-energy neutrino experiment. The muons are accelerated and allowed
to decay in a storage ring with long straight sections. It is the neutrinos from the decaying
muons (both νµ and νe) that are directed to the detectors.

Neutrino Beam

Figure 3: Overview of a neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring.

The main components of the scenario described here are shown in Fig. 3, and are:

• A proton driver of moderate energy (< 50 GeV) and high average power (1-4 MW)
similar to that needed for a muon collider, but with less stringent requirements on the
charge per bunch and somewhat less need for power.

• A target and pion capture system that can be identical to that for a muon collider.

• Reduction of the muon energy spread at the expense of spreading them out over a
longer time interval (longitudinal phase rotation). The system can be designed to
correlate the muon polarization with time, allowing control of the relative intensity of
νµ and νe in a forward beam. All this could probably be identical to that for a muon
collider.

• A limited amount of cooling: about a factor of 50 in six phase-space dimensions,

compared with the factor of 106 needed for a muon collider.

• Fast muon acceleration to 50 GeV in a system of an induction linac and two recircu-
lating linear accelerators (RLA’s). This could probably be identical to that for a muon
collider designed for Higgs production (Higgs Factory).

11

• A collider ring with long straight sections that could point to one or more distant
neutrino detectors for oscillation studies, and to one or more near detectors for high
intensity studies. This ring is rather diﬀerent from one that maximizes luminosity of
muon-muon collisions.

Advantages of a neutrino factory are:

• The spectrum of the neutrinos from muon decay are very well deﬁned, particularly
compared to conventional neutrino beams from pion decay where proton beam size
and position, horn current and timing, and the condition of the target and horn can
all aﬀect the ﬂuxes and backgrounds.

• There are almost equal electron and muon neutrino types made, and both neutrinos
and antineutrinos can be obtained. In beams from pion decay, only 6muon neutrinos
are available with small backgrounds of the other types.

• The numbers of neutrinos per initial proton are comparable in the two schemes, and
for low energy neutrinos there is no ﬂux advantage in the factory. But for high energy
neutrinos, the conventional approach requires high energy protons, of which, for a
given power, there will be fewer. The neutrino factory can, in principle, use the same
relatively low energy protons to produce the same number of neutrinos at any energy
independent of the neutrino energies, and the number can remain high. For 50 GeV
neutrinos, the gain is between one and two orders of magnitude over conventional
beams.

• The intensities are suﬃciently high that one can use oscillation baselines of the order
of the Earth’s diameter. One could build a neutrino factory in the US and detect
neutrino oscillations in the Gran Sasso detector in Italy, or build the factory in Europe
and direct a beam to the US. Such intensities and distances also allow the study of
the neutrino-matter interaction (MSW eﬀect). Measurements at multiple distances
would, in principle, allow the complete determination of the neutrino mass matrix (the
equivalent of the CKM matrix), including CP violations, while also addressing the
possible existence of sterile neutrinos.

• A neutrino factory is also a ﬁrst step towards a muon collider. It would be simpler
build than a muon collider, would demonstrate most of the components of a collider,
and might be upgradable to a collider.

In the remainder of this section, we discuss the various components of a neutrino factory

in greater detail.

4.2 Proton Driver

The number of pions per proton produced with an optimized system varies linearly with the
proton energy [54]. Thus, the number of pions, and the number of muons into which they
decay, is proportional to the proton beam power. This might suggest that the proton energy
could be selected arbitrarily, but the situation is more complicated.

12

The total six-dimensional emittance of the produced muons depends on, among other
things, the pion bunch length, and thus on the rms proton bunch length σp if that length is
longer than a length c τdecay that is characteristic to the decay process:

where τπ is the pion lifetime and γπmπ is the pion energy. The pion yield peaks at Eπ ≈ 300
MeV, which gives τdecay ≈ 1 nsec. This, if the proton energy is low, can imply a large tune
shift in the proton ring prior to extraction:

τdecay =

∆ν ∝

∝

hBi σt ǫ⊥ γp

,

(18)

(19)

where np is the number of protons in a bunch, C is the circumference of the proton driver,
hBi is the average bending ﬁeld, and ǫ⊥ is the transverse emittance of the protons. The
above dependency favors a higher proton energy.

It also favors a high repetition rate with relatively fewer protons per bunch, but once
again the situation is complicated. The total six-dimensional emittance of the produced
pions depends also on the number of proton bunches employed to ﬁll the storage ring. This
favors a small number of large proton bunches in the driver, and thus a larger tune shift.

However, a high driver repetition rate with smaller numbers of protons per ﬁll would not
increase the emittance per ﬁll and would still reduce the tune shift. The diﬃculty with this
approach is that the higher repetition rate increases the wall power required for the pulsed
rf needed for acceleration and cooling.

These considerations favor a proton driver of 15-25 GeV energy, 1-4 MW power, with a
ring cycling at 5-15 Hz, and a bunch length of order 1 nsec. Each cycle accelerates about
1014 protons in 4-6 bunches space about 150 m apart. Such a proton driver has signiﬁcantly
higher power than any in present use in the high energy community, and is comparable to
those under design for neutron spallation sources.

4.3 Target and Capture

To maximize the muon yield from pion decay, pions are captured from the peak of their
production spectrum at around 300 MeV/c longitudinal momentum. The corresponding
transverse momenta extend to beyond 200 MeV/c, so a rather diﬀuse cloud of pions must be
captured. This is best done with a solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld, whose acceptance of particles
Indeed, solenoid
at large angles is much superior to that of a sequence of quadrupoles.
magnets must be used to contain the pion/muon beam over much of its length. The target
is surrounded by a 20-T hybrid solenoid magnet [55], followed by an adiabatic transition to
the 1-T ﬁeld of the decay and phase rotation channel.

The large pulse of energy deposited by the 1-4 MW proton beam in the target on nsec
time scales lead to transient pressure waves that are problematic for the long-term survival
of solid targets. Therefore, a target based on a free mercury jet is under serious study [54],
with a moving belt target as a backup concept [56]. At lower beam powers, a radiatively
cooled carbon target may be viable. However, the yield of pions per proton is higher for a
high-Z target material.

13

The target and proton beam are at an angle to the axis of the capture system to minimize
re-absorption of the spiralling pions in the target, and to permit dumping of the proton beam
to the side of the system, perhaps in a pool of mercury. Figure 4 sketches the main features
of the target and capture apparatus, along with the beginning of the phase rotation channel.
The capture system is very similar to that considered for a muon collider source [23].

Figure 4: Targetry, pion capture, and beginning of phase rotation.

4.4 Phase Rotation #1

An early, high-gradient phase rotation is required if muon polarization is to be selected
without particle loss. Forward decays, having one polarization, yield higher energy muons
than backward decays, which have the other. If full phase rotation occurred before decay,
then polarization and ﬁnal energy are fully correlated, but signiﬁcant correlation is obtained
even with partial rotation before decay. The essential requirement is that signiﬁcant energy
changes occur before the decay. Phase rotation after decay cannot distinguish energy changes
due to decay kinematics from the energy spread of the initial pions, so there is no way to
separate the diﬀerent polarizations.

The ﬁrst phase rotation is accomplished by a sequence of low-frequency rf cavities that
reside inside a solenoid magnet which contains the beam transversely. The ﬁrst cells of this
are sketched in Fig. 4. At the end of this ﬁrst phase rotation stage, the bunch length has
increased by a factor of 6 and the energy spread has decreased by the same amount. Figure 5
shows a simulation of the bunch at the end of the ﬁrst phase rotation.

Alternative scenarios without this ﬁrst stage of phase rotation are under study [58],

always with the result that the polarization separation will be lost.

the end of the ﬁrst phase rotation. Color and symbols indicate polarization
P : + (red): P > 0.3, o (green): 0.3 > P > −0.3, − (black): −0.3 < P .

4.5 Mini Cooling

Reduction of the phase volume of the muon beam must be accomplished before the muons
decay, which limits the applicability of stochastic cooling and electron cooling. Rather,
we propose to use the technique of ionization cooling [59] in which the muons lose both
transverse and longitudinal momentum while passing through bulk matter, and only longi-
tudinal momentum is restored via rf acceleration. This technique is uniquely applicable to
muons because of their minimal interaction with matter, and can be performed in less than
a microsecond.

The ﬁrst stage of cooling at a neutrino factory, called mini cooling, consists simply of
a hydrogen absorber in a solenoidal ﬁeld, and serves two purposes.
It reduces the muon
energies so that the subsequent drift length for a second phase rotation could be kept short.
It also lowers the transverse emittance by almost a factor of two.

In a current simulation [52], the mini cooling was done in a single hydrogen absorber
placed in a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld of 1.25 T, with simulated results as shown in Fig. 6. Such
cooling introduces canonical angular momentum and it will probably be desirable to do the
mini cooling in two stages with a ﬁeld reversal between them.

4.6 Phase Rotation #2

The purpose of phase rotation is to minimize the muon momentum spread, which can be
done at the expense of lengthening the bunch up to a distance approaching the initial proton
bunch spacing (≈ 150 m in the example discussed here). The very long resulting bunch is
then rebunched at a higher frequency (≈ 175 MHz), yielding a train of about 30 individual
muon bunches for every initial proton one.

In addition, this phase rotation results in the polarization being correlated with time, i.e.,
bunch number, instead of energy. This correlation can, in principle, be preserved thereafter.

Figure 6: The longitudinal-phase-space distribution of the muon bunch after
the mini cooling by liquid hydrogen. Color and symbols indicate polarization
P : + (red): P > 0.3, o (green): 0.3 > P > −0.3, − (black): −0.3 < P .

The second phase rotation is performed by a drift (≈ 150 m), followed by energy correc-

tion, followed by bunching.

In the present example, an induction linac (≈ 100 MeV acceleration) is used in which
the pulse shape is tailored to correct the time-energy correlation generated by the drift.
The induction linac must supply a rapid train of accelerations, spaced by the proton bunch
spacing, and equal in number to the number of proton bunches.

Figure 7 shows the simulated energy vs. time distributions after the drift, and and after
the energy correction in the induction linac. The simulated ﬁnal polarizations vs. bunch po-
sition are shown in Fig. 8. The maximum muon polarization is a rapid function of the initial
proton bunch length, as shown in Fig. 9. In the simulation, the average muon polarization
at the end of the induction linac is 0.37, and the momentum spread is dp/p ≈ 2 %. If only
20% of the muons are kept, the polarization could be 0.6.

Bunching can be done either before or after the energy correction. The bunching fre-
quency considered here is a multiple of 350 MHZ, the frequency of the superconducting
cavities that are assumed to be used in the later acceleration.

More eﬃcient bunching may be possible if the initial energy is lower and the bunching is
done together with acceleration [58]. This suggests that a second mini cooling with about
1 m of hydrogen could be used to lower the muon energies to about 25 MeV, followed by the
bunching and acceleration back to 100 MeV. The addition of the second mini cooling would
further reduce the required conventional cooling to follow [60].

4.7 Cooling

A simple comparison of the total produced six-dimensional emittance and the total accep-
tance of a plausible storage ring indicates that cooling should not be needed. But without
cooling, the muon accelerator would have to have a transverse rms acceptance of ≈ 20 π
mm-rad (full acceptance ≈ 0.2 π m-rad). This we have shown is possible with large-aperture

solenoid focusing and low-frequency rf, but would be expensive.

A more reasonable acceleration scheme considers an rms transverse acceptance of ≈ 1.5 π
mm-radians. A cooling scenario based on the so-called super-FOFO [61] lattice of conﬁning
magnets (Fig. 10) is under study. The current simulation, using a ﬁxed lattice and operating
at a central momentum of 185 MeV/c cools to below 3 π mm-radians, as shown in Fig. 11.
It does not achieve the required 1.5 π mm-radians because of Coulomb scattering at the
end. Other lattices, with stronger ﬁelds easily reach the required ﬁnal emittance, but do not
accept the full initial emittance. More work is needed here.

In a bunched beam, particles with large transverse amplitude must have higher total
velocity (higher energy) so that their longitudinal velocity, vz, remains matched to that of

the bunch. This is not practical for relativistic beams, but can be arranged for nonrelativistic
beams such as considered here.

If the phase-rotation drift and buncher have a lattice with the same amplitude-vz prop-
erties as the cooling lattice, then the correlation is automatically generated. Remember:
the drift sorts particles by vz, not energy. After the drift, their longitudinal position is a
function of that vz which is the required correlated combination of energy and amplitude.
The bunching, done in the same lattice (or one with the same properties) is also a bunching
by vz, not energy, so the correlation is preserved. And so into the cooling.

Note that a simple solenoid will NOT do for the drift or bunching, since vz is a function
not only of amplitude, but also of angular momentum. A solenoid of one sign gives a higher
vz for one angular momentum sign than the other. Both drift and bunching must done with
alternating ﬁelds of some kind that maintain the canonical angular momentum near zero.
The super-FOFO lattice satisﬁes this requirement.

4.8 Acceleration

Acceleration of the cooled muon beam from 185 MeV/c (≈ 100 MeV) to 50 GeV is achieved
by a linac followed by two recirculating linear accelerators (RLA’s).

The present assumption is that the larger second (and possibly also the ﬁrst) recirculating
accelerator uses LEP superconducting cavities, or cavities with the same parameters and
dimensions. The use of these cavities sets constraints on the minimum energy for which
the required emittance can be transported. If the full (≈ 10 m long) cryostats, containing
four cavities, are used as is, then this minimum energy is approximately 8 GeV. This is
taken as the approximate injection energy into the second RLA. If the cavities are rehoused
individually in new cryostats, then the minimum energy is approximately 2 GeV. This is
used as the approximate injection energy the ﬁrst RLA.

More detailed considerations of the RLA’s, and of the storage ring lattice, are given in

[62].

4.9 Storage Ring

Geometries

The geometry of the storage ring is site speciﬁc, being a function of both the ring and
detector locations. Figure 12 shows directions and direct distances from rings at BNL or
FNAL to Gran Sasso, Soudan, and SLAC. The circumference of such rings for 50 GeV muons
must be of order 1 km, even using bend magnets of several Tesla, so that a large fraction of
the length can be in neutrino-beam-producing straight sections.

Figure 12: Neutrino beam paths between various possible sites for source and
detectors.

For physics reasons (to separate MSW from vacuum oscillations), two diﬀering ring to
detector distances are required. If the two detectors lie in approximately opposite directions
from the ring then it seems reasonable to design the ring with long sides that point to the

20

two detectors, adding, if needed, a third straight to close the ring. Two geometries are of
particular interest (Fig. 13):

• A triangular geometry lying in a tilted plane. This minimizes the amount of bending
required and maximizes the total straight for a given circumference. But, the lengths
of the straights pointing at the two distant detectors is NOT maximized.

• A “bowtie”, or ﬁgure-of-eight geometry, also lying in a tilted plane. This geometry
uses more total bending, but does maximize the important straights. It also has the
interesting feature of not precessing the muon spins. A variant of the bowtie looks
much the same but does not lie in a plane, so that there is a signiﬁcant separation of
the beams where they cross. In this case there is a slow precession of spin.

The bowtie can be made asymmetric so as to maximize the length of the upward
straight.

lengths (m)

Figure 13: Possible bowtie and triangular geometries for a muon storage ring
designed to deliver neutrino beams to two distant detectors.

To send a neutrino beam to a detector on another continent, a straight section in the
storage ring must have angle at least 30◦ to the horizontal. The resulting vertical extent of
the storage ring is at least 100 m. If the ring is below the surface, various geological issues
must be addressed. It may be more practical to build the ring above ground and bury it
under an artiﬁcial hill.

Lattice

The emittance that the storage ring must accept is estimated by supposing there is 20%
emittance growth in the accelerator in each of three directions. We require an acceptance of
3 σ in each of the 6 dimensions. If the bunch spacing is 1.7 m (corresponding to the 175 MHz
bunching used here), then a reasonable maximum rms bunch length in the collider would be
6 cm. Thus the minimum momentum spread in this case would be σp = 0.1%.

21

The rms beam divergence in the straight sections should be ≈ 0.1/γ in order a) to maxi-
mize the dependence of the νµ to νe ratio on the polarization; and b) to assure that the ﬂux ob-
served is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the exact magnitude of this divergence. To achieve this
low divergence, the required beta function in the major straights is βmajor straights ≥ 75 m.
For the up-going straight, aimed at a near detector on the surface, there is probably not
such a stringent requirement on the beam divergence. If the divergence here is required to
be below 1/3 of 1/γ, then βupgoing straight ≥ 8 m.

4.10 A First Look at Event Rates

The numbers of surviving muons, per incident proton, at various stages of the accelerator
complex are summarized in Table 1.

(20)

For a proton power of 1.5 MW, and the muon survival eﬃciencies given in Table 1, we
would, in a year of 107 s of operation, obtain 4 × 1020 muons decaying in the storage ring.
If we take the fraction of the ring pointing to a given detector to be 0.25 (approximately as
in the bowtie geometry), then the number of decays pointing to the given detector will be
approximately 1020.

Table 2 gives charged current neutrino interaction rates per kton-year as a function of
baseline length L for an Eµ = 50 GeV muon storage ring in which there are 1 × 1020
unpolarized muon decays per year within a neutrino beam-forming straight section [63].
The rates are listed for

23 = 3.5 × 10−3 eV2/c4 and sin2 2θ23 = 0.1,

23 = 3.5 × 10−3 eV2/c4 and sin2 2θ23 = 1.

Also listed are the rates for the unoscillated neutrino interactions, the corresponding statis-
tical signiﬁcance of the disappearance signal (numbers in parentheses), and the rates for the
antineutrino interactions.

For comparison, the approximate numbers of events in the proposed CERN - Gran Sasso
experiment (NGS) [17], and Minos [16] experiments, are given in Table 3. It is seen that
the numbers of events with the 1.5-MW neutrino factory, in a detector at the same 730 km,
is approximately 100 times that in the NGS, or about 40 times the highest energy Minos
example.

5 Muon Colliders

A neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring is a possible ﬁrst step towards a muon
collider [23]. This section brieﬂy reviews the motivation for muon colliders, and sketches a
sequence of such colliders.

The Standard Model of electroweak and strong interactions has passed precision exper-
imental tests at the highest energy scale accessible today. Theoretical arguments indicate
that new physics beyond the Standard Model associated with the electroweak gauge symme-
try breaking and fermion mass generation will emerge in parton collisions at or approaching
the TeV energy scale. It is likely that both hadron-hadron and lepton-antilepton colliders
will be required to discover and make precision measurements of the new phenomena.

The next big step forward in advancing the hadron-hadron collider energy frontier will
be provided by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a proton-proton collider with a
center-of-mass (CoM) energy of 14 TeV which is due to come into operation in the latter
half of the next decade.

The route towards TeV-scale lepton-antilepton colliders is less clear. The lepton-antilepton
colliders built so far have been e+e− colliders, such as the Large Electron Positron collider
(LEP) at CERN and the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) at SLAC. In a circular ring such as
LEP the energy lost per revolution in keV is 88.5 × E4/ρ, where the electron energy E is in
GeV, and the radius of the orbit ρ is in meters. Hence, the energy loss grows rapidly as E
increases. This limits the center-of-mass energy that would be achievable in a LEP-like col-
lider. The problem can be avoided by building a linear machine (the SLC is partially linear),
but with current technologies, such a machine must be very long (30-40 km) to attain the
TeV energy scale. Even so, radiation during the beam-beam interaction (beamstrahlung)
limits the precision of the CoM energy [64].

For a lepton with mass m the radiative energy losses are inversely proportional to m4.
Hence, the energy-loss problem can be solved by using heavy leptons. In practice this means
using muons, which have a mass ≈ 207 times that of an electron. The resulting reduction in
radiative losses enables higher energies to be reached and smaller collider rings to be used
[70]. Estimated sizes of the accelerator complexes required for 0.1-TeV, 0.5-TeV and 3-TeV
muon colliders [23, 66] are compared with the sizes of other possible future colliders, and

and BNL sites. The energies in parentheses give for lepton colliders their

with the FNAL and BNL sites in Fig. 14. Note that muon colliders with CoM energies up to
≈ 4 TeV would ﬁt on these existing laboratory sites. Figs. 15 and 16 show possible outlines
of the 0.1 TeV and 3 TeV machines. Parameters for 10 to 100 TeV colliders have also been
discussed [65].

Muon colliders oﬀer signiﬁcant physics advantages. The small radiative losses permit
very small beam-energy spreads to be achieved. For example, momentum spreads as low as
∆P/P = 0.003% are believed to be possible for a low-energy collider. By measuring the time-
dependent decay asymmetry resulting from the naturally polarized muons, the beam energy
could be determined with a precision of ∆E/E = 10−6 [67]. The small beam-energy spread,
together with the precise energy determination, would facilitate measurements of the masses
and widths of any new resonant states scanned by the collider. In addition, since the cross-
section for producing a Higgs-like scalar particle in the s-channel (direct lepton-antilepton
annihilation) is proportional to m2, this extremely important process could be studied only
at a muon collider and not at an e+e− collider [68]. And, of course, the decaying muons will
produce copious quantities of neutrinos. Even short straight sections in a muon-collider ring

Laboratory site as an example.

will result in neutrino beams several orders of magnitude higher in intensity than presently
available, excellent for nonoscillation neutrino physics in a near detector.

The First Muon Collider will be a unique facility for neutral Higgs boson (or techni-
resonance) studies through s-channel resonance production, as illustrated in Fig. 17. Mea-
surements can also be made of the threshold cross sections for production of W +W −, t¯t,
1, ˜ℓ+ ˜ℓ− and ˜ν¯˜ν – that will determine
Zh, and pairs of supersymmetry particles – χ+
the corresponding masses to high precision. A µ+µ− → Z 0 factory, utilizing the partial
polarization of the muons, could allow signiﬁcant improvements in sin2 θw precision and in
B-mixing and CP-violating studies.

The Next Muon Collider will be particularly valuable for reconstructing supersymmetric
particles of high mass from their complex cascade decay chains. Also, any Z ′ resonances
within the kinematic reach of the machine would give enormous event rates. The eﬀects of
virtual Z ′ states would be detectable to high mass. If no Higgs bosons exist below ∼1 TeV,
then the NMC would be the ideal machine for the study of strong W W scattering at TeV
energies.

The cost of building a muon collider is not yet known. However, since muon colliders are

relatively small, they may be signiﬁcantly less expensive than alternative machines.

The front end of a muon collider is very similar to that of a neutrino factory, with the
important diﬀerence that the muon phase volume must be cooled by a factor of 106 rather
than ≈ 100. During this larger cooling, the longitudinal phase volume must shrink along
with the transverse. Since ionization cooling as proposed here directly cools only transverse
space, a muon collider must include an exchange between longitudinal and transverse phase
volumes so that cooling of the latter eﬀectively results in cooling of the former as well.

Another diﬀerence between the two machines is that a muon collider must provide muon

27

bunches of both signs simultaneously, while in a neutrino factory only one sign of muons is
utilized at any given time. Further, a storage ring with long straight sections optimized for
neutrino beams is not ideal for high-luminosity muon-muon collisions, particularly at lower
energies.

6 Research and Development

6.1 Historical Introduction

The interest of the present proponents has evolved from our investigations of muon colliders,
the concept of which was introduced by Budker [70], and developed further by Skrinsky et
al. [71], and by Neuﬀer [72]. This work pointed out the signiﬁcant challenges in designing
an accelerator complex that can make, accelerate, and collide µ+ and µ− bunches all within
the muon lifetime of 2.2 µs (cτ = 659 m), and provided preliminary sketches of technical
solutions.

A concerted study of a muon collider design has been underway since 1992 [73]. By the
Sausalito workshop [74] in 1995 it was realized that with new ideas and modern technology,
it may be feasible to make muon bunches containing a few times 1012 muons, compress
their phase space and accelerate them up to the multi-TeV energy scale before more than
about 3/4 of them have decayed. With careful design of the collider ring and shielding it
appears possible to reduce to acceptable levels the backgrounds within the detector that arise
from the very large ﬂux of electrons produced in muon decays. These realizations led to an
intense activity, which resulted in the muon-collider feasibility study report [75] prepared for
the 1996 DPF/DPB Summer Study on High-Energy Physics (the Snowmass’96 workshop).
Encouraged by further progress in developing the muon-collider concept, together with
the growing interest and involvement of the high-energy-physics community, the Muon Col-
lider Collaboration became a formal entity in May of 1997 [76, 77]. An overview of the
activities and plans of the Muon Collider Collaboration is given in [23].

That a neutrino factory would be a good ﬁrst step towards a muon collider has been
explored in two Collaboration workshops [24, 25] as well as by ECFA/ICFA study groups
[26, 78]. The NuFact’99 Workshop [27] in June 1999 provided a focus for international
interest in neutrino factories, motivated by the outstanding physics prospects plus the need
for truly global facilities for long baseline neutrino physics.

Accordingly, the Muon Collider Collaboration has recently changed its name to the Neu-
trino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration, and is redirecting its eﬀorts towards an early
realization of a neutrino factory. A Muon Steering Group [79] has been formed in Europe to
coordinate eﬀorts there towards the same goal. These two structures are formally distinct,
but there is excellent communication among members of the two groups.

The Muon Collider Collaboration has proposed an R&D program that features hardware

studies of two key aspects of a muon collider:

• Targetry, capture and phase rotation at a muon source [80],

• Final-stage ionization cooling at a muon collider [81],

28

in addition to an ongoing program of machine theory and simulation. There has been one
outside review of the R&D program [82], conducted in July, 1999 by the Muon Technical
Advisory Committee (MUTAC) of the Muon Collider Oversight Group (MCOG). The MU-
TAC report [83] and the MCOG report [84] following this review emphasized that the R&D
program should be conducted in the context of “a more formal, long range, R&D plan” with
a “focus on one object for a complete, detailed study”. They noted that “a neutrino source
appears as the most likely possibility” for that study.

Consistent with the emerging emphasis on a neutrino factory, the Collaboration is re-

examining its R&D priorities, as well as seeking broader support for these activities.

6.2 R&D Needs for a Neutrino Factory

The overall path of an R&D program involves conceptual design, demonstration of feasibility
of novel components, followed by cost optimization. A neutrino factory based on a muon
storage ring is still very much in the early phases of conceptual design, with some items
identiﬁed as needing veriﬁcation as to their feasibility. Nonetheless, there are some pressures
to concern ourselves with cost issues already at this early stage [85].

The prominent R&D issues for a neutrino factory are listed below, following the sequence

of components in the accelerator complex.

1. Coherent design concept of an entire neutrino factory.

2. Proton driver: 1-4 MW, 5-15 Hz, ≈ 5×1013 protons per bunch, 1 ns bunch length.
The critical issue of short bunch length in a proton synchrotron is under study by an
ANL-BNL-FNAL-KEK-LANL collaboration [86, 87, 88, 89].

3. Pion yields from proton-nucleus collisions. A neutrino factory would collect very
low energy pions, for which the rate is maximal. Such pions are partially absorbed in
the targets of most prior production experiments, so the data are questionable. A
recent measurement by members of the Collaboration should improve our knowledge
from proton beams of 6-24 GeV [90]. An experiment to study yields from 2-GeV
protons is being considered at CERN (sec. 6.4) in the context of the option for a
proton driver linac.

4. Production target. Proton pulses of 70-280 kJ energy and 1 ns length are incident
on the target, leading to substantial issues of “shock” damage, cooling and materials
survivability in a high radiation environment. While it is natural to consider solid
targets, their viability is considered marginal, and liquid targets are the alternative.
For maximal pion production, a free liquid jet target is to be preferred in principle.
There is no example of such a target.

5. Capture solenoid. Optimal pion yields are obtained when the target is surrounding
by a solenoid of ﬁeld ≈ 20 T, followed by an adiabatic transition to a solenoidal channel
of a few T. Such a magnet would be a superconducting hybrid with a resistive insert
[55]. A key question is the eﬀect of radiation damage on such a device.

29

6. Beam dump. The 1-4 MW proton beam is dumped inside the target/solenoid system.

A ﬂowing liquid dump may be more appropriate than a solid dump.

7. First Phase Rotation. If polarized muon beams are to be obtained, the production
target must be quickly followed by a high-gradient, low-frequency rf system, combined
with a solenoid channel, to bunch the pion/muon beam. Little is known about the
viability of such a system near an intense radiation source.

8. Mini Cooling. The use of a passive liquid hydrogen absorber to provide initial trans-
verse cooling of the muon beam by a factor of two is well understood in principle,
although it never has been demonstrated.

9. Second Phase Rotation. For the second step in the bunching process, the muons
must be accelerated by 80-100 MeV to restore the energy lost in the mini cooling.
A large acceptance induction linac with a programmed waveform is required. The
parameters of the linac are somewhat beyond those presently demonstrated.

10. Bunching to ≈ 400 MHz. This is believed to be relatively straightforward.

11. Ionization Cooling. The challenges of further acceleration and storage of the muon
beam will be substantially easier if the transverse phase area of the beam can be
reduced by an additional factor of 10. This cannot be accomplished in a single step of
ionization cooling, but must involve alternating ionization cooling and rf acceleration,
all in a magnetic channel. This is a key area for study, and a hardware demonstration
is very appropriate.

12. Acceleration. The acceleration from ≈ 100 MeV to ≈ 50 GeV is best accomplished
in recirculating linacs with superconducting rf cavities. Rather large acceptances are
required, and the machine parameters are again somewhat beyond those presently
demonstrated.

13. Muon Storage Ring. The desire for multiply directed neutrino beams with very
small angular divergence leads to novel designs for the storage ring, whose plane is
far from horizontal. Besides issues of lattice design, there will be considerable civil
engineering challenges in building such a ring.

The R&D needs for a muon collider are very similar, but with additional challenges in
cooling and storage ring design. At least four orders of magnitude more cooling (including
continual exchange between transverse and longitudinal emittance) are required for a muon
collider than a neutrino factory, and a rather diﬀerent ring is needed to maximize collider
luminosity than simply to hold the muons while they decay.

A sense of the Collaboration’s views as to the relative urgency of addressing the above
issues is given by the following ranking. Given in parentheses are the institutions presently
involved in R&D into these topics.

1. Coherent design study (the Collaboration as a whole).

2. Target, dump, phase rotation (ANL, BNL, UCLA, CERN, LBNL, ORNL, Princeton).

30

3. Ionization cooling (ANL, BNL, Budker Inst., UC Berkeley, UCLA, FNAL, IIT, Indiana

U., LBNL, NHMFL, Northern Illinois U., Princeton).

4. Induction linac (LBNL).

5. Recirculating linacs, superconducting rf (Jeﬀerson Lab).

6. Storage ring design (BNL, CERN, FNAL, LBNL).

7. RF power sources (BNL, CERN, FNAL, LBL + industry).

8. Eﬀects of radiation on superconducting magnets (MSU).

9. Fabrication of superconducting magnets (LBNL, NHMFL + industry).

10. RF bunching.

11. Engineering of a tilted ring.

12. Engineering of “conventional” facilities (FNAL, ORNL).

Proton driver issues are very site speciﬁc, and have been left oﬀ the second list as being
somewhat outside the scope of the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration. Pion
production cross sections were also left oﬀ the second list as being adequately addressed by
eﬀorts largely outside the Collaboration.

The strategy for pursuit of the R&D topics listed above is an interesting challenge in
itself. The variety of questions is large, and several go beyond the scope high-energy ac-
celerator experience. A neutrino factory is still too novel a concept to be sponsored as a
well-deﬁned program at a single accelerator laboratory. The cooperative eﬀorts of people
at many institutions is needed to bring the concept of a neutrino factory to the stage of a
formal Conceptual Design.

The Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration has taken responsibility for the
coordination of multi-institutional R&D eﬀorts on the non-site-speciﬁc aspects of a neutrino
factory. While the topic of research is largely accelerator physics, the operation of the
Collaboration is more similar to that of a large experimental physics group proposing a novel
detector than to that of past accelerator projects. The Collaboration has been successful in
providing a means of groups of people working together, as facilitated by numerous workshops
[91], video conferences [92], web sites (see links at the primary site [76], and an archive of
technical documents [93]. Additional eﬀorts are needed to enhance the coherence of this
work, an important step of which will be the appointment of an R&D Coordinator. There
remains the issue of the response of the Collaboration to the advice of the MUTAC that
“the ﬁrst round of Design and Simulation activities may requires 10-15 accelerator experts
for 1-1/2 to 3 years. The coherence required for success in this activity demands full-time
workers in close communication.”

To carry out the R&D program sketched above, the Collaboration seeks additional re-

sources in two categories:

31

1. Support for a core group of physicists, most of whom are in residence at a single site,
likely a national laboratory. Support is sought for both staﬀ positions, and for visitors
who would locate at the core site for at least several months at a time.

2. Support for the various particular R&D topics listed above, which work may well be

eﬀectively pursued at diverse labs and universities.

Partial support for Collaboration eﬀorts in both categories of work is presently available via
direct funds from the Advanced Technology R&D Program (and to a much smaller extent
from the Physics Research Program) of the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as from
discretionary funds at the major U.S. national laboratories. The state of Illinois has made a
commitment to a university consortium heading by IIT for funding beginning in year 2000.
CERN is starting an R&D program, (sec. 6.4), with initial funding in the present ﬁscal year.
We have previously estimated that a robust R&D program for muon colliders would
require about $15M/year. A very similar ﬁgure is appropriate for neutrino factory R&D,
as this is eﬀectively a transformed muon collider R&D program. Our present funding is
approximately 1/2 of this amount.

The favorable outcome of our R&D program is, of course, the construction of a neutrino
factory. Prior to this, we anticipate the elevation of eﬀort to that of a major project at at least
one national laboratory. The role of the Collaboration will no doubt evolve signiﬁcantly in
such case, but it can and should continue to play a key role in harnessing the diverse resources
needed to design a neutrino factory. The original role of the Collaboration as a vehicle for
broad-based eﬀorts towards a muon collider will again be important as a neutrino factory
becomes associated with a particular site.

6.3 The Potential of Muon-Beam-Based Particle Physics and the

NSF-Supported Community

Just 20 years ago the DoE assembled a HEPAP Subpanel on Accelerator R and D. In the
letter conveying their report to HEPAP the Subpanel Chair wrote: “You will note that in
the 50 odd years of American accelerator science associated with particle physics research,
enormous strides in increasing particle beam energies and in decreasing unit costs have
been and are being made. ... Our primary conclusion is that, despite the spectacular past
and present accomplishments of the ﬁeld, we must redouble our eﬀorts to improve the cost
eﬀectiveness of our accelerators if the needs of US particle physics are to be met in the
resource-limited situation in which we ﬁnd ourselves...”

Unfortunately, as recent history and current events show, this observation is even more
apt today than it was those 20 years ago. This is not for want of zeal and good ideas. In
the intervening years considerable progress in understanding the fundamentals of “classical”
accelerator science and improving classical accelerator technology has been made. There
have also been some advances based on technologies not previously used in elementary-
particle-physics accelerator work, e.g., laser and plasma technology. It is, however, a fact
that none of these eﬀorts, to date, have qualitatively changed the cost of providing signiﬁcant
luminosity at what is now the energy frontier. Consequently, it is not an exaggeration to say
that today we are in danger of pricing ourselves out of the market.

32

In recent years, as accelerator science and technology have become more and more so-
phisticated and thus more specialized, the task of developing the accelerators needed for
the future has more and more been left to experts – specialists in accelerators. They have
done an excellent job indeed. The capabilities of today’s accelerators would have even been
unthinkable 20 years ago.

Nevertheless, we ﬁnd ourselves in the unenviable position that each new energy-frontier
facility being discussed turns out to be in the multi-billion dollar class. This diﬃculty might
ﬁnd a direct political solution from time to time as history unfolds and the competitive juices
ﬂow strongly again. However, if this had been the path followed in the past, elementary
particle physics would not be able to ask the compelling questions that it can ask today.
Thus, the direct approach of tackling the problem scientiﬁcally and technologically is likely
to be more dependable – no guarantees. One obvious avenue is to broaden the scientiﬁc
and technical idea base which might support signiﬁcant improvements in accelerator cost
eﬀectiveness. This implies that the problem, OUR problem, needs to be brought more
directly and eﬀectively to the stakeholders in elementary particle physics, that is to say, to
the university and laboratory community of experimental and theoretical physicists who now
concern themselves primarily with the particle physics and detector instrumentation. This
has been tried to some degree in the past, with only modest success. Today the need is more
apparent and, in addition, we now have a made-to-order challenge that needs all the new
and non expert ideas that it can get - the possibility of doing elementary particle physics
with high energy muon beams through muon acceleration and storage for intense neutrino
production, and later directly for µ-µ collisions.

Many aspects of this concept are new enough that even the experts have to start from
scratch. This stems from the unusual requirement that the job has to be done quickly owing
to the ﬁnite life of the beam and, perhaps more importantly, that an enormous spread in
beam momenta and angle must be accommodated if the required capture eﬃciency is to
be met. The situation is somewhat analogous to the situation in accelerator science forty-
odd years ago when folks tracked particles through magnetic ﬁelds using the Runge-Kutta
method with a Marchant calculator. All of that calculation with the attendant trial and error
struggle to ﬁnd workable system designs was made obsolete with the elegant theoretical work
of Courant, Livingston and Snyder and many others. They discovered powerful methods for
dealing with paraxial ray beams of relatively narrow energy spread. These methods are
of limited use in studying the optics of a muon-based neutrino source or collider where
nonlinearities are controlling rather than perturbations. Not only that, but the main optical
components will probably have to be solenoids, a device which has heretofore not been used
for the principal focusing and bending elements in high energy machines. Trying to master
all this puts everyone more or less on the same footing and begs for some new tactics from
the classical mechanics buﬀs among us. Latter day Courants, Livingstons and Snyders are
sorely needed.

There are yet other unprecedented challenges. The science and technology of quickly
reducing the phase space volume of the beam needs developing before muon beams of the
required brightness can be produced. While basic ideas for accomplishing this via ionization
cooling have been around for years, the practical problem of realization is also new to the
experts and involves very fundamental physics, some of which is not yet known with the
depth required to support the needed technology.

33

Considerable attention has been focused on the potential physics opportunities for muon-
based neutrino science and on possible means for attacking it. A Neutrino Factory and Muon
Collider Collaboration (NFMCC), formed of members from the DoE supported Labs, Budker
Institute for Nuclear Physics and some universities, has been formed and has been at work
for some time. An idea of the progress that has been made is presented in secs. 1-5 of this
document, which makes clear that a resolution of the basic particle and accelerator physics
issues remains in the future and that more ideas, more work and much R&D lie ahead even
in evaluating whether our community can and should propose such a facility.

Taking into account the fact that there is a great deal of talent, knowledge and expertise
in the university community – both DoE and NSF supported – not now engaged in addressing
the pressing accelerator issues, it would seem most appropriate to try to tap that pool. To
make this possible, two things at least are needed. First, they have to be made aware of
the possibilities and challenges. This the world community in general and the NFMCC in
particular are doing. The NFMCC will be emphasizing this aspect more in the coming
year. Second, modest start-up resources are necessary for preliminary engagement with the
accelerator challenges, resources such as funding for post docs, some computing and modest
beginnings of technical R&D. It is with respect to these needed monetary resources that we
are addressing this 1999 MRE Panel.

Within one to two years it may well become apparent that large R&D expenditures,
i.e., 10’s of M$, by NSF-supported university groups working on the accelerator aspects
of muon-beam elementary particle physics, will be appropriate. This would require a joint
application for MRE funding. The eﬀort required to plan and justify such an application
for review by the physics community, being an unusual enterprise, needs unusual support.
Our hope is that this MRE Panel will appreciate this special need and recommend to the
NSF that, where possible, they provide start up resources for currently supported university
particle physics groups to become so engaged in the knowledge that this work may well lead
to an MRE proposal in the not too distant future.

6.4 European R&D Activities on Muon Storage Rings and Neu-

trino Factories

There is growing interest in Europe for muon storage rings and particularly neutrino factories.
Several working groups have been set up to study:

1. The accelerator aspects of a neutrino factory at CERN;

2. The physics of neutrino oscillations;

3. The opportunities oﬀered by high-intensity neutrino muon and hadron beams;

4. The physics opportunities of the extension of a neutrino factory to a precision muon

collider [78].

Discussions with physicists and accelerator engineers from European institutes and lab-
oratories, and from CERN, have focused on identifying important missing elements in the
currently debated designs of muon storage rings, with a view to avoiding duplication of
eﬀorts while contributing signiﬁcantly towards the design of a neutrino factory.

34

The European community is considering the following R&D projects:

1. A hadron production experiment at the CERN-PS. The aim is to measure
charged pion production by 2-16 GeV protons, data that are needed for a quantitative
design of pion capture and phase rotation. The very same experiment can be extended
to hadron production by pions, so as to deliver the entire set of data that is needed for
a reliable calculation of the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux.

2. A large-angle muon scattering experiment. This experiment would measure with
high precision the large-angle scattering of muons with momentum of a few hundred
MeV/c in various materials including liquid hydrogen, as theoretical calculations are
not reliable enough to assess the performance of ionization cooling of muons.

3. Exposure of an rf cavity to radiation and a magnetic ﬁeld. One of the big
unknowns is the reliability of operation of the rf cavities which are currently discussed
for pion capture and phase rotation, and which will have to operate in a high-radiation
ﬁeld and possibly in strong solenoidal magnetic ﬁelds. Experiments with pulsing rf
cavities would also be performed with a view to achieving higher gradients.

4. High-power target tests. Current design work is focussed on targets which with-
stand a beam power of 4 MW or even larger. While not considered impossible, this
is a daring goal for which, however, considerable know-how is available in Europe
(CERN, GSI, KFA Julich, PSI, RAL), which can and should be channeled towards an
interesting and forward-looking challenge.

This proposed program of experimental R&D work in Europe is by and large comple-
mentary to the R&D activities planned or under way in the USA. This experimental work is
augmented by theoretical studies, both in the area of physics and detectors, and in the area
of accelerator design (proton linac, fast-cycling synchrotron, muon recirculators).

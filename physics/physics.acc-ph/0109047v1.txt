Introduction

This paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the new type of the undulator radiation
(acoustically induced radiation – AIR) generated by an ultra-relativistic charged particle
channeling along a crystal plane, which is periodically bent by a transverse acoustic wave
(AW), as well as to the conditions limiting the observation of this phenomenon. This
mechanism, suggested recently in [1, 2], makes feasible the generation of electromagnetic
radiation, both spontaneous and stimulated, emitted in a wide range of the photon
energies, from X- up to γ-rays.

The mechanism of the AIR generation is illustrated in ﬁgure 1. Under the action of
a transverse acoustic wave propagating along the z-direction, which deﬁnes the center
line of an initially straight channel (not plotted in the ﬁgure) the channel becomes

periodically bent. Provided certain conditions are fulﬁlled (see below in this section and
in section 3), the beam of positrons, which enters the crystal at a small incident angle
with respect to the curved crystallographic plane, will penetrate through the crystal
following the bendings of its channel.
It results in the transverse oscillations of the
beam particles while travelling along the z axis. These oscillations become an eﬀective
source of spontaneous radiation of undulator type due to the constructive interference
of the photons emitted from similar parts of the trajectory. As we demonstrate below,
the number of oscillations can vary in a wide range from a few up to a few thousands
per cm depending on the the beam energy, the AW amplitude, a, and wavelength, λ,
the type of the crystal and the crystallographic plane. In addition to the spontaneous
photon emission by the undulator, the scheme presented in ﬁgure 1 leads to a possibility
to generate stimulated emission. This is due to the fact, that photons, emitted at the
points of the maximum curvature of the trajectory, travel almost parallel to the beam
and, thus, stimulate the photon generation in the vicinity of all successive maxima and
minima of the trajectory.

Some aspects of the electromagnetic radiation by a beam of charged particles
channeling in a crystal undergoing the action of an ultrasonic wave have been discussed
in the literature [3]–[9]. We shall mention the main results obtained in the cited papers
and outline the features, both of formal and of principal nature, which distinguish the
AIR radiation described above from the eﬀects considered in [3]–[9] at the end of this
section.

Prior to that let us brieﬂy discuss the phenomena closely related to the mechanism
of generating the acoustically induced radiation. These are the channeling eﬀect, the
channeling radiation and the undulator radiation.

The basic eﬀect of the channeling process in a straight crystal is that a charged
particle can penetrate an anomalously large distance inside a crystal if travelling nearly
parallel to the crystallographic plane or axis and experiencing the collective action of
the electric ﬁeld of the lattice ions. Positively charged particles are steered into the

3

interatomic region (the planar channeling) while negatively charged projectiles move in
vicinity of the ionic chains (the axial channeling).

Channeling was discovered in the early 1960s by computer simulations of ion motion
in crystals [10, 11]. Large penetration lengths were obtained for ions incident along
crystallographic directions of low indexes. It is interesting to note that such a guided
motion had already been predicted [12] by Stark in 1912 [12]. A comprehensive
theoretical study [14, 13] introduced the important continuum approximation for the
interaction potentials between energetic charged projectiles and lattice atoms arranged
in atomic strings and planes. These concepts were subsequently widely used in the
interpretation of channeling experiments (see e.g. the review article [15]). During recent
years particular attention has been paid to studying of the channeling phenomenon at
high energies of the particles [16, 17, 18]).

The idea of bending the high-energy beams of charged particles, proposed in [19],
has become of great current interest [16, 18], [20]-[24], [25] because of its practical
application for the manipulation of the beams. Indeed, the high-energy beams can be
bent by crystals as eﬃciently as by means of external electric or magnetic ﬁelds. The
size of such crystals is typically hundreds times smaller than the size of the equivalent
magnet. In recent experiments with 450 GeV protons [23] the eﬃciency of the particle
beam deﬂection was reported on the level of 60%.

Another possible application of bent crystal was suggested in [26], where the question
whether the channeling eﬀect can also be used to focus beams, especially heavy-ion
beams, was discussed. To this end a crystal is needed in which the crystal axes are no
longer parallel, but are slanted more and more the farther away they are from the axis
of the beam. Then the bending angle of the particles far away from the beam axis would
be largest and a general focusing eﬀect will result. Such a crystal can in principle be
produced by varying the germanium to silicon ratio in a mixed crystal [26].

The criterion for a stable channeling of an ultra-relativistic particle in a bent crystal
was formulated in [19] and has clear physical meaning: the maximum centrifugal force
due to the channel bending must be less than that of the interplanar ﬁeld. Provided
this condition is fulﬁlled, the beam of (positively charged) channeling particles at each
instant moves inside the channel, especially parallel to the bent crystal midplane as it
does in the case of linear channeling.

Two realistic ways of “preparation” of a periodically bent channel may be discussed.
It is feasible, by means of mordern technology [25], to grow the crystal with its channels
been statically bent according to a particular pattern. The channeling phenomenon
has been also considered in the periodic structures such as superlattices [5, 6]. THe
[3] - [9], of a dynamically bent crystal, arises if one considers
possibility [1, 2],
propagation of an acoustic wave along some particular direction in a crystal as shown
in ﬁgure 1. Under the action of the AW the crystal channels, being linear initially,

4

will be periodically bent.
In both cases the passage of an ultra-relativistic particle
along the bent channel gives rise to the AIR phenomenon due to the curvature of the
trajectory, provided that the projectile is trapped into the channel. The latter condition
is subject to the general criterion for the channeling process in a bent crystal [19] (see
also [3, 25, 27]), and can be fulﬁlled by a proper choice of projectile energy and maximal
curvature of the channel, as described below in the paper.

The advantage of the static channel is that its parameters are ﬁxed and, thus, the
projectile moves along the ﬁxed trajectory as well. To calculate the characteristics of
the emitted radiation one needs to know only the number of the periods and the local
cuvature radius. The disadvantage is that when ﬁxing the number of periods then the
parameters of the system can be varied only by changing the energy of the particle.
This makes the photon generation less tunable.

The motion of a particle in the ﬁeld of the channel bent by transverse AW becomes
periodic and, therefore, the spectrum of radiation emitted by a projectile acquires
essential features of the undulator radiation.

It is natural that the AIR emission is accompanied by the ordinary channeling
radiation [28, 29]. This speciﬁc type of electromagnetic radiation arises due to the
transverse motion of the channeling particle inside the channel under the action of the
interplanar ﬁeld. The phenomena of the channeling radiation of a charged projectile in
a linear crystal (see eg. [30, 31, 32]) as well as in a “simple” (i.e. non-periodically) bent
channel [27, 33], are known, although in the latter case the theoretical and experimental
data are scarce, at least up to now.

≫

We demonstrate in our paper that the AIR and the ordinary channeling radiation
can be separated provided the condition a
d is fulﬁlled (see ﬁgure 1). Then the
frequency of the particle oscillations inside the channel is much higher than the frequency
of the transverse oscillations caused by the AW. Therefore, these two motions are well
separated and the AIR mechanism can be treated independently from the ordinary
channeling radiation. We shall discuss this important issue in more detail in section 3.
Here let us only note that a similar situation occurs in a one-arc bent crystal, where the
channeling charged particle generates additional synchrotron type radiation due to the
curvature of the channel [27, 33]. This component of the total radiation intensity leads
to the undulator eﬀect in the channel periodically bent by AW. We will show that the
intensity of AIR can be made larger than that of the channeling radiation.

As was pointed out in [1, 2], the system “ultra-relativistic charged particle +
periodically bent crystal channel” represents by itself a new type of undulator,
and, consequently, serves as a new source of undulator radiation of high intensity,
monochromaticity and with a particular pattern of the angular-frequency distribution.
The electromagnetic radiation in this undulator arises mainly due to the bending of
the particle trajectory which follows the shape of the channel. The parameters of this

5

undulator, as well as the characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation, depend on the
type of the crystal and on the crystallographic plane, on the type of projectile and its
energy; they also depend on the shape of the bent channel, and, thus, can be varied
signiﬁcantly by varying the enlisted characteristics.

The theory and also the various practical

implementations of the undulator
radiation, e.g. the radiation emitted by a charge moving in spatially periodic static
magnetic ﬁelds (a magnetic undulator), in a laser ﬁeld (a laser-based undulator), etc.
have a long history [34, 35] and are well elaborated [30, 31, 36, 37]. It is also known [38]
that a positively charged ultra-relativistic particle, undergoing a planar channeling in a
linear crystal, radiates electromagnetic waves whose spectral and angular distributions
are those of the undulator (a natural undulator) due to the transverse oscillations caused
by the action of the repulsive interplanar potential. Also the characteristics of the
radiation emitted in a natural undulator are very sensitive to the distribution of the
particles in the beam over the transverse energy and the incident angle.

The important feature of the dynamically bent crystal by means of an AW is that it
allows to consider an undulator with the parameters Nu and p (here Nu is the number
of periods in the undulator and p = 2πγ a/λ is its parameter (see ﬁgure 1), and γ
is the relativistic factor) varying over a wide range, which is determined not only by
the projectile’s energy but also by the AW frequency and amplitude. The latter two
quantities can easily be tuned resulting in the possibility of signiﬁcantly varying the
intensity and shape of the angular distribution of the radiation.
It is important to
note that the parameters of the acoustically based undulator are inaccessible in the
undulators based on the motion of charged particles in periodic magnetic ﬁelds and also
in the ﬁeld of laser radiation [30, 36, 39].

In the suggested scheme AIR is generated by the relativistic charged particles, with
relativistic factors γ = ε/mc2
1 (c is the velocity of light, m is the mass of the particle
and ε is its energy). The large range of γ available in modern colliders for various
charged particles, both light and heavy, together with the wide range of frequencies
and the amplitudes possible for AW in crystals allow to generate AIR photons with the
energies up into the GeV region [1].

≫

As demonstrated in [2], the speciﬁc pattern of the undulator radiation combined
with the AIR mechanism allows to discuss the possibility to create a powerful source
of stimulated monochromatic radiation of high-energy photons. We analyse this
important possibility in more detail in the present article. Particular attention is
paid to the investigation of the inﬂuence of various physical processes, such as the
photon attenuation and the dechanneling eﬀect of positrons in crystals, both leading to
a reduction in the ampliﬁcation of the stimulated photon emission.

Let us brieﬂy outline here the assumptions, which are adopted in this paper and
formulate the main conditions which allow to consider the AW bent crystal as an

6

undulator.

Although the general treatment of both the undulator radiation (section 2) and the
channeling process in the AW bent crystal (section 3) can be applied to axial and a
planar channeling, we consider the latter case because it is known (see e.g.
[25]) that
for bent crystals negatively charged projectiles are steered along crystallographic axes
In fact,
much less eﬃciently than positively charged ones along the crystal planes.
experimentally the axial channeling of negative particles has not been observed so far.

Two important conditions which we assume to be fulﬁlled are the following:

a)

The bending of the channel becomes signiﬁcant if the AW amplitude is noticeably
larger than the interplanar spacing, d (see ﬁgure 1). Thus, the strong inequality

a

d

(1)

(2)

is implied throughout the paper. Typically, the spacing between the planes, which
are characterized by the low values of the Miller indices (such as the (100), (110)
and (111) planes), lies within the range 0.6 . . . 2.5 ˚A(see e.g.
[25] and table 1 in
10 ˚A.
section 5) below. Therefore, (1) is fulﬁlled for the AW amplitudes a

≥

b) The channeling process in a bent crystal takes place if the maximal centrifugal force
in the channel, mγv2/Rmin (where Rmin is a minimum curvature radius of the bent
channel) is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar ﬁeld [19, 3, 40, 27]:

mγv2/Rmin < q U ′

max.

Here q is the charge of the projectile and the quantity U ′
gradient of the interplanar ﬁeld.

max stands for the maximum

Provided (2) is fulﬁlled, the projectile, incident at small angle with respect to the
mid-plane, will be trapped in the channel (see ﬁgure 1). The condition (1) allows
to disregard the oscillations of the particle inside the channel due to the interplanar
force q U ′. Therefore, the particle trajectory will be primarily harmonic deﬁned by the
equation

y(z) = a sin

z = [0 . . . L]

(cid:18)

Here L stands for the thickness of the crystal. The minimum curvature radius of this
trajectory is equal to Rmin = (λ/2π)2/a. Thus, the decrease in Rmin and, consequently,
the increase in the maximum acceleration of the particle in the channel is achieved
by decreasing λ and increasing a. As a result, photon emission due to the projectile’s
acceleration in the bent channel may be signiﬁcantly enhanced. This radiation is emitted
coherently from similar parts of the trajectory, and may dominate [1] over the channeling
radiation.

7

An adequate approach to the problem of the radiation emission by an ultra-
relativistic particle moving in an external ﬁeld was developed by Baier and Katkov in
the late 1960s [41] and was called by the authors the “operator quasi-classical method”.
The details of that formalism can be found in [31, 42] and will not be reproduced here.
The advantage of this method is that it allows to use the classical trajectory for the
particle in an external ﬁeld and, simultaneously, it takes into account the eﬀect of the
radiative recoil.

The classical description of the particle motion is valid provided the characteristic
energy of the projectile in an external ﬁeld, ¯h˜ωo, is much less than its total energy,
ε = mγc2. The relation ¯h˜ωo/ε
1 is fully applicable in the case of an ultra-
relativistic projectile. Typical values of ¯hωo are in the order of magnitude equal to the
continuous potential-well depth, vary from several eV for the crystals of light materials
(e.q. the LiH crystal [43]) up to 102 eV for the crystals of heavy materials (e.g. the W
crystal [25]).

The quasi-classical approach neglects the ¯hωo/ε terms, but it explicitly takes into
account the quantum corrections due to the radiative recoil in the whole range of the
emitted photon energies, except for the extreme high energy tail of the spectrum.

Using this method the spectra of photons and electron-positron pairs in linear
crystals were successfully described [31].
It was also applied to the problem of
synchrotron-type radiation emitted by an ultra-relativistic projectile channeling in a
non-periodically bent crystal [27, 33].

We use this general formalism of Baier and Katkov in our paper to treat the AIR

phenomenon.

To conclude the introductory section let us discuss the results of the papers [3]–
[9] where the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charge passing through a crystal
undergoing the action of an ultrasonic wave was considered.

As far as we are aware of, the ﬁrst study of the inﬂuence of an external ultrasonic
ﬁeld on the radiation of channeling particles in a crystal was given in [3]. In this article
(see also [4]) spontaneous emission by channeling particles in a silicon crystal bent
10 MHz was brieﬂy considered. The estimates
by an acoustic wave of a frequency
carried out in [3, 4] were based on the so-called dipole approximation for the undulator
radiation (see e.g.[30]). The latter implies that the strong inequality, p
1
is valid, so that all the undulator emission occurs in the fundamental harmonic. Such
an assumption leads to a considerable narrowing of the parameters of the AIR radiation
and, also, disregards the possibility to generate the emission in higher harmonics.

In papers [7, 9] the spontaneous channeling radiation in the presence of a low-
amplitude ultrasonic wave was considered by means of classical electrodynamics. In this
d, resulting, thus,
limit the AW amplitude is much less than the interplanar spacing, a
in low values of the curvatures of the acoustically bent channels. This inequality allowed
the authors of [7, 9] (see also [5]) to consider the phenomenon of resonant enhancement
of the photon yield due to the coupling of two mechnisms of the photon emission, the
channeling radiation [28, 29] and that induced by the AW.

≪

In [6] both the spontaneous undulator emission and that of a free electron laser
type was investigated in the case of a relativistic positron beam channeling through a
periodically strained lattice. In this paper the main attention was paid to the radiation
emitted in an undulator based on a solid state superlattice (see also [5]). By using
the formalism of classical electrodynamics the authors of [6] performed a self-consistent
treatment involving the wave equation for the electromagnetic radiation ﬁeld and the
kinetic equation for the positron distribution function. The important result, which is
the gain coeﬃcient for the forward radiating ﬁeld was obtained analytically in a closed
form. Numerical estimates of the gain in the case of a resonant coupling of the channeling
radiation and that arising from the superlattice based undulator were presented.

In [6] there is also a short comment on the possibility of using an acoustically bent
crystall as an undulator.
In our opinion, the analogy between a superlattice and an
acoustic wave can not be considered as adequate, because the acoustic wave amplitude,
a, can greatly exceed the interplanar distance d, whereas in the superlattice based
d. This latter case was analyzed in
undulator the inverse condition is assumed, a

≫

It is stressed in ﬁgure 1 and in (1) that we consider here the opposite case
a
In this limit there is no resonant coupling between the channeling and the
undulator radiation because the characteristic frequencies of the photons emitted via
these mechanisms are totally incomparable (see section 3). As a result it is possible
to distinguish two mechanisms of the radiation formation in an acoustically bent
crystal and to investigate the properties of the AIR, both spontaneous and stimulated,
separately from the channeling radiation.

As we demonstrate below, staying within the regime deﬁned by (1), it is possible,
by tuning the AW amplitude or frequency, to vary signiﬁcantly the intensity of the
AIR radiation, to change the patterns of its spectral and angular distributions. These
characteristics of the radiation, as it is known from the general theory of undulators
(e.g. [31]), are crucially dependent on the magnitude of the undulator parameter p. In
our paper we provide the analysis of the AIR radiation for both limiting cases, p2
1
and p > 1.

≪

In the case a

d it is important to establish the conditions under which
the acoustically bent crystal may serve as an undulator for the channeled ultra-

relativistic particle. A comprehensive analysis of these conditions, and consequently,
the establishment of the ranges of all parameters in the problem (these are: the AW
amplitude, frequency and velocity, the type of projectile and its energy, the width of
the channel and the magnitude of the interplanar ﬁeld) inside which the AIR process is
feasible, are studied in our paper. In contrast such a discussion is fully omitted in the
papers cite above.

Another point we wish to emphasis is that the quasi-classical approach used in
our paper is more appropriate than the purely classical treatment utilized in the cited
papers. In our paper we consider the spectral distribution of the radiation in the whole
range of the photon energies: ¯hω = 0 . . . ε. It is clear that the classical approach is valid
only in the soft-photon limit, i.e. ¯hω
ε
where the quantum corrections (the radiative recoil) must be taken into account. The
emission of high-energy photons becomes important for energies of projectile positrons
in the tens GeV range.

ε, but is totally inappropriate in the case ¯hω <
∼

≪

In our paper it is demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, that it is feasible to consider, by
means of the AIR mechanism, stimulated emission within the 10−2 . . . 100 MeV range.
To establish this interval we carried out a realistic analysis of the inﬂuence of the
dechanneling and the photon attenuation eﬀects on the spectrum of the AIR radiation.
All the features mentioned above distinguish the results presented below from the

earlier works [3]-[7], [9].

Finally, let us note that we do not consider the electromagnetic radiation [8] arising
during the projectile channeling in an ultrasonically excited crystal due to speciﬁc
diﬀraction of the photons by sets of periodically bent planes.

The paper is organized as follows:
In section 2 the general formalism of the quasi-classical description of the undulator
radiation is presented. Section 3 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the conditions which
allow to consider the acoustically bent crystal as an undulator. Numerical results for
the angular and spectral distributions of the undulator radiation as well as the energy
loss due to the AIR are presented in section 4 for various crystals and projectile energies.
In section 5 the estimates, both analytical and numerical, for the possibility to generate
the stimulated emission by means of the acoustically based undulator are presented. In
section 6 we outline the relevant problems which, to our mind, deserve to be thoroughly
investigated.

2. Quasi-classical description of the undulator radiation

Within the framework of the quasi-classical approach the distribution of the energy
radiated in given direction by an ultra-relativistic particle (of a spin s = 1/2) and
summed over the polarizations of the photon and the projectile, is given by the following

Let us now obtain a general quasi-classical expression for the radiated energy,

The radius vector and the velocity of the particle in an undulator satisfy the conditions

Expression (10) together with the deﬁnitons (11) clearly exhibit the features typical
for the undulator radiation [36]. The radiation intensity is proportional to the square
of the total number of the undulator periods, N 2

radiation.

The spectral and angular dependence of the radiation are determined mainly by the
function D(η), which is well-known in a classical theory of diﬀraction [42]. This function
has sharp maxima at the points η = K = 1, 2, 3 . . .. It is most clearly seen in the case

3. Acoustically bent channel as an undulator

In this section we formulate the conditions which, in addition to (1)and (2), must be
fulﬁlled to consider the system “AW + channeled particle” as an undulator.

Let us consider the case of planar channeling of an ultra-relativistic positively
charged particle in a channel bent by a monochromatic transverse acoustic wave (AW)
which is transmitted in the z-direction (see ﬁgure 1). The shape of the channel centerline
is described by the dependence (3).

Another condition which we impose on the AW is

ξ

ka = 2π

≡

a
λ ≪

1

where the quantity k denotes the AW wave number, k = 2π/λ. It will be demonstrated
below that the condition (30) holds in all cases which are of interest.

3.1. Motion of the particle in a channel bent by the AW

Let a particle enter the crystal at the point z = 0 having a small incident angle with
respect to the (curved) crystallographic plane. The corresponding quantitative criterion
will be given below.

In the case of small-angle injection one may use the continuous potential
approximation to describe the interaction of the particle with the crystallographic plane
[15, 25]. This potential, U(ρ) depends only on the transverse displacement, ρ, of the
particle from the mid-plane of the channel (

ρ
|
In the case of an ultra-relativistic projectile the classical approach adequately
describes the projectile motion, so that one may totally disregard the quantum
corrections to the transverse oscillations of the projectile in the channel due to the
action of the interplanar potential U. The following estimate proves this statement. Let
Uo denote the depth of the interplanar potential well. The separation of the neibouring
energy levels, ¯h˜ωo, of the transverse oscillations is equal, by the order of magnitude, to
¯h˜ωo ≈

q Uo/d2mγ. Hence, the number of these levels, estimated as

We assume that the dependence U(ρ) on ρ in the case of a bent channel is the same

as for a linear one. Below we demonstrate that this assumption is adequate.

The Hamiltonian of the particle, H = √p2c2 + m2c4 + qU(ρ) does not explicitly
depend on t, hence, the relation γ = H/mc2 = γ0 (1 + qU/mc2γ0) is valid, with
v2/c2)−1/2 and v standing for the initial particle velocity. The condition
γ0 = (1

the trajectory deﬁned by (3). The deviation, (36), of the real trajectory from (3) can

variety of crystals. One can also deduce from ﬁgures 2 that within the range of validity

3.2. The undulator conditions

Now we formulate the conditions (in addition to the channeling condition established
above, eqs. (39)-(40)) which allow to consider the system “AW + channeled particle”
as an undulator.

Let L denote a crystal thickness. Both the motion of the projectile in the acoustically
bent channel and the spectrum of the generated radiation are of the undulator type,
only if

λ

L,

≪

(41)

i.e. if the channeling particle oscillates many times within the length of the crystal. As
with any other undulator, the suggested undulator is characterized by the frequency,
ω0, and the undulator parameter, p (see (20, 23b). These quantities depend on the
AW amplitude and the wave length, and on the relativistic factor, and are expressed as
follows:

ω0 = ck = 2π

p = γξ

γka = 2π γ

= 2π γ

(42)

c
λ

,

≡

a
λ

a ν
V

For further reference let us note the diﬀerence in functional form of p for the AW
undulator and that for the undulators based on magnetic ﬁelds (both helical and planar).
In the latter case the undulator parameter is equal to (see eg. [47]) pB = qBλB/2πmc2,
where B is the amplitude value of the magnetic induction and λB is the period of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The quantity pB is independent on γ whereas p from (42) is linearly
proportional to it.

21

In ﬁgures 2 the dotted and the chain lines indicate the constant values of the
undulator parameter p. Note that each dotted and chain line corresponds to diﬀerent
values of p depending on the energy of the projectile. Values of p corresponding to the
energy 5/50/500 GeV are shown in ﬁgure 2 in the vicinity of each line. The broken
lines correspond the constant values of the parameter N both for positron and proton,
which is deﬁned as the number of the AW periods per 1 cm: N (cm−1) = λ−1. Figures
2 demonstrate that, within the range of validity of the channeling condition (40), the
parameters p and N vary over wide ranges: N = 1...100, p = 0.1
500 for a positron
0.1 for a proton. The upper limiting values of the p’s are
projectile and p = 0.001
larger by more than an order of magnitude than those accessible in the undulators based
on the motion of charged particles in periodic magnetic ﬁelds [39].

The undulator parameter p is proportional to a (see (42)). In this connection the
question arises of the validity of the assumption that a = const during the time of
ﬂight, τ = L/c, of the particle through the crystal. Hoevwr, for a running or standing
AW the amplitude is time dependent. To formulate a quantitative criterion let us
consider the crystal bending by a standing AW. In this case the constant value a must
be substituted with ˜a(t) = ao cos(2π ν t). For time scales τ
1/ν, one gets the following
˜a(t), of ˜a(t) from its amplitude on the timescale

This condition allows to distinguish two mechanisms for the radiation formed in the
channeling process in an acoustically bent crystal, and to consider all the radiation in
the spectral region ω

ωc as formed via the undulator mechanism.
We note here, that the inequality (44) is fulﬁlled in the whole range of the AW
parameters consistent with the channeling condition (40), only if d < a (eq. (1)) is valid
too. In the opposite case, a < d [5, 6, 7], which can be realized in the undulators based
on a superlattice [6] or/and on a low-amplitude AW [5, 6, 7] the frequencies ωu and
ωc can be of the same order of magnitude and, thus, two mechanisms of the radiation
formation must be treated simultaneously. As mentioned several times already, in the
present paper only the case d < a is considered.

When discussing the motion of the particle in a bent channel and the undulator
conditions, we ignored so far the eﬀects of dechanneling and the photon attenuation.
The inﬂuence of these eﬀects on the undulator radiation will be discussed in the next
sections.

Let us summurize our results so far: Provided conditions (1), (40, 41, 43) are fulﬁlled,
the system “ultrarelativistic charged particle + acoustically bent crystal” represents
a new type of planar undulator, and, consequently, serves as a new source for high-
frequency undulator radiation of high intensity, monochromaticity and a particular
pattern of the angular-frequency distribution. The latter as it will be illustrated in
the next sections. The validity of the classical treatment of the particle motion in a
bent channel allows to apply the quasi-classical approach, described in the previous
section, for calculating the characteristics of the undulator radiation.

4. Numerical results for dE(n)/dω dΩn and dE/dω

In this section we present numerical results for the spectral and the angular distrbutions
of the spontaneous undulator radiation formed during a passage of an ultra-relativistic
particle through an acoustically bent crystal. The calculations are performed by using
the formalism outlined in section 2. We resctrict ourselves to the case of positron planar
channeling.

4.1. The angular distribution of the radiation

We start with the illustration of the general features of the angular distribution of the
radiation formed in an acoustically based undulator.

Figures 3 and 4 correspond to the case of a 50 GeV positron channeling along (110)
plane in a carbon crystal of thickness L = 1 cm. For chosen values of the AW amplitude
10−7 cm and frequency ν = 20 MHz, the corresponding magnitudes of the

total number of the undulator periods, the undulator parameter and the fundamental
harmonic energy are as follows: Nu = 17, p2 = 10.1, ¯hω1 = 9.9 MeV. In a diamond

Figure 3 represent the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted along the
undulator axis, ¯h−1 (dE(n)/dω dΩn)θ=0◦ (see (24)). Each peak corresponds to the
emission into the odd harmonics [30, 31, 36], the energies of which are deduced from
the relation

It is seen that all harmonics are well separated:

the distance between two

neighbouring peaks is 2¯hω1 ≈
MeV. In the vicinity of each main maximum the shape of the spectral distribution is
governed by the behaviour of the function D(η) deﬁned in (11).

Two 3D plots in ﬁgures 4(a) and 4(b) allow to visualize the spatial behaviour of the
angular distribution of the radiation (at ﬁxed frequency) as a function of the azimuthal,
ϕ, and the polar, θ, angles of the photon emission.
In these ﬁgures the quantity
lg (dE(n)/d(¯hω) dΩn) (measured along the z-axis) as a function of the azimuthal, ϕ,
and the polar, θ, angles of the photon emission is plotted for two central harmonics.

The undulator axis lies along the z direction, and yz is the undulator plane. The
positive y direction corresponds to ϕ = 0◦. In these ﬁgures the dimensionless variable
θ/θ0 is used to characterize the distribution in of the radiation with respect to the polar
angle. In the considered case the quantity θ0, deﬁned by (21), is equal to θ0 = 23 µrad.
Figures 4(a,b) illustrate general features intrinsic to the planar undulator radiation
in the case p2
1. We ﬁrst note that the intensity of the radiation in the odd harmonic is
governed by a powerful maximum in the forward direction, whereas there is no radiation
in even harmonics for θ = 0◦ The latter reaches its maximal values in nearly forward,
but not in forward, directions. Apart from the intensity peak in the forward (for K
odd) or nearly forward (K even) direction, the radiation in a particular harmonic is
emitted in a wide range of the polar angles. In both of the ﬁgures there are several
clearly distinct non-forward peaks in which the radiation intensity reaches the maxima,
= 0◦ rapidly decrease
although the magnitudes of dE(n)/d(¯hω) dΩn in the maxima at θ
with the polar angle (recall the log scale along the z-axis).

≫

Another feature to be mentioned is the abscence of the axial symmetry in the angular
distribution shape. More speciﬁcally, the radiation emitted within the undulator plane
θ0 = p/(√2γ), whereas the cone angle for the photon
is concentrated in the cone θk ∼
emission in the direction perpendicular to the yz plane equals θ⊥ ∼
1/γ. Thus, the ratio
p/√2 characterizes the above mentioned asymmetry in the angular distribution
θk/θ⊥ ∼
with respect to the atimuthal angle ϕ. This ratio is equal to 2.2 in the considered case.
This peculiarity most clearly exhibits itself in the shape of the spatial distribution of
the radiation in the odd harmonics in the forward direction, see ﬁgure 4(a).

By changing the parameters of the acoustically based undulator (which are the
AW amplitude and frequency, the type of a crystal, and the relativistic factor γ of the
projectile positron) it is possible to vary the intensity of the radiation, the energy, width
and the number of emitted harmonics. To illustrate this statement in ﬁgures 5(a,b,c) we
present the dependencies of the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted at θ = 0◦
for a 2, 5 and 10 GeV positron channelling along (110) planes in Ge and Si crystals. In
addition to the parameters indicated in the ﬁgures there are other ones, i.e. the crystal
length, the number of the undulator periods, the undulator parameter, the fundamental
harmonic energy and the width of the line. They are the following:

Figure 5(a): L = 0.1 cm, Nu = 36, p2 = 3.25, ¯hω1 = 53 keV, ¯h ∆ω = 2.9 keV;

Figure 5(b): L = 1 cm, Nu = 43, p2 = 6.9, ¯hω1 = 0.23 MeV, ¯h ∆ω = 10.5 keV;

Figure 5(c): L = 1 cm, Nu = 43, p2 = 27.8, ¯hω1 = 0.27 MeV, ¯h ∆ω = 12.7 keV.

4.2. The spectral distribution of the radiation

For large undulator parameters, p > 1, the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted
by a charged projectile channeling in a crystal bent by an acoustic wave is obtained from
eqs. (26,27). Using these formulae, we calculated the spectral distributions for diﬀerent
parameters of the AW and for various crystals. The results of the calculations are
presented in ﬁgures 6–8.

Figures 6(a,b) exhibit dependencies of dE/d(¯hω)/L/Nu (in cm−1) for ε = 50 and
ε = 500 GeV positrons moving along the (110) channels in a diamond and a tungsten
crystal. The AW frequency is ﬁxed at ν = 10 MHz.
In these ﬁgures each curve
shows the ω-dependence obtained at a particular value of the AW amplitude and the
corresponding value of the undulator parameter p, as indicated. The lowest values
for the AW amplitude are chosen to be consistent with the condition (1), where the
parameter d is equal to 1.26 ˚A for a diamond and 2.24 ˚A for a tungsten (110) channels
[25]. The largest a-values correspond to the relation ε/(Rmin eU ′

1/6 (see (39)).

max)

These ﬁgures demonstrate that at a certain frequency ν the intensity of radiation
can be varied in a wide range by altering the AW amplitude, which is proportional to
the value of the undulator parameter as a = p/(γk), or by choosing the type of a crystal.
The latter option aﬀects the value of the undulator parameter via its dependence on the
sound velocity V : p = γ (2πν/V )a. Therefore, for equal a, ν and γ the AIR intensity,
being proportional to p (see (26)), is approximately (VC/VW )
4 times higher for a
tungsten crystal as compared with that for a diamond.

The radiation intensity can also be varied by changing the AW frequency at

4.3. The energy loss due to the AIR

The stability of spontaneous undulator radiation formed during the passage of the
projectile through an acoustically bent crystal of total length L to a great extend is
subject to the condition ∆ε/ε
1, where ∆ε is the absolute decrease in the projectile
energy, ε, due to various inelastic processes. In particular, the above-written inequality
implies, that the energy loss, ∆ε, due to spontaneous AIR only must be small compared
with ε.

To estimate this quantity in the case p2

1 it is necessary to integrate dE/dω from

(26) over the interval ¯hω = 0 . . . ε. On the other hand, to obtain ∆ε for p2 < 1 it is
suﬃcient to use the classical expression (28) for the spectral and angular distribution
of the radiation and to carry out the integrations over the angles ϕ and θ and over the
photon energies.

In ﬁgures 9(a,b) the dependencies of the relative energy loss, ∆ε/ε, on the energy
of the projectile ε is plotted for a positron channeling in (110) channels for C, Si and
W crystals and for various AW frequencies as indicated. The curves in ﬁgure 9(a)
correspond to the AW amplitude a = 2 nm, which is equal, by the order of magnitude,

ﬁgures the AW frequency and amplitude are subject to the strong inequality ν2a

of the undulator periods, Nu is related to L, ν and the AW velocity V according to
Nu = L

Except for the case p2 < 1, it is hardly feasible to establish by explicit analytical
means the ranges of parameters inside which the inequality ∆ε/ε

Indeed, expressions (26) and (27) exhibit quite complicated dependence of dE/dω, and,
consequently, that of ∆ε on ε, a and ν. In addition to these the energy loss is dependent
(indirectly, through the conditions (1), (40) and (41)) on the parameters of the crystal,

5. Stimulated emission

In this section we discuss the possibility to generate stimulated emission of high energy
photons by means of a bunch of ultra-relativistic particles of length Lb moving in a
channel bent by a transverse acoustic wave.

The mechanism of the emission stimulation is illustrated in ﬁgure 10. The photons
emitted in the nearly forward direction at some maximum/minimum point of the
trajectory by a group of particles of the bunch stimulate the emission of the same
photons by another (succeding) group of particles of the same bunch when it reaches
next maximum/minimum.

Photons, which are emitted in the forward direction by the positron bunch (dark
block) as it passes the undulator maximum (marked with A), stimulate the emission
by the same bunch in the vicinity of the next maximum (marked with B). It is assumed
that the length of the bunch, Lb , its velocity, v, and the undulator period λ, satisfy the

In the theory of free-electron lasers (FEL) this principle is called “Self-Ampliﬁed
Spontaneous Emission (SASE)” [48, 49] and usually is referred to the FEL operation in
the high gain (or collective instability) regime [50, 51, 52, 53].

An accurate treatment of the evolution of the photon pulse in the SASE mode implies
that the space charge ﬁelds, energy spread of the particles in the beam and diﬀraction
eﬀects are taken into account [53]. In the case when the beam undergoes channeling
the picture must be additionally complicated by considering the dechanneling dynamics
[25] as well as the photon attenuation [54].

We do not aim to fulﬁl this program in the present paper. Instead, for the suggested
undulator, we shall present an estimate of the gain exploiting the general relationship
between gain and spontaneous spectrum of undulator radiation [30, 55]. Thus, we
disregard the dynamics of the particles in the undulator and consider the case of a
monoenergetic beam of independent particles. Additionally we assume that there is
no beam divergence. The eﬀects of dechanneling and photon attenuation are discussed
qualitatively on a phenomenological level.

5.1. General expression for the gain

It is our aim to establish the range of parameters (which are: the AW amplitude and
frequency (wavelength), the type of the particle and its energy, and the type of a crystal)
within which there is a principle possibility to consider the SASE radiation by means of
the acoustically bent crystal.

It had been established long ago [56] that in a free-electron device the stimulation
of emission occurs if only the photon frequency is equal to that of the spontaneous
undulator radiation, ωK (see (13)).

Let us estimate the gain factor, gK, which deﬁnes the increase (i.e. the case gK > 0)
or the decrease (if gK < 0) per 1 cm in the total number, NK, of the emitted photons
at a frequency ωK

dNK = gK NK dz,

due to stimulated emission (absorption) by the particles in the beam. We shall do this
[53]). Also we restrict our
within the frame-work of low-gain approximation (see eg.
ε, and, hence,
consideration to the case of the stimulated emission of soft photons, ¯hω
ω′ = ω (see (6)).

gets the following expression for the gain, corresponding to the increase in the number

of the radiation intensity in the forward direction.

≪

5.2. Estimations of gK for the AW based undulator

Expressions (54a) and (54b) allow to make quantitative estimates concerning the
possibility of stimulated emission of the high-energy photons.

Before carrying out this analysis let us note two main qualitative features which
distinguish the AW based undulator and that based on the action of the periodic
magnetic ﬁeld. In the latter case both the particle and the photon beams propagate
in vacuum. Therefore, there are no strong mechanisms leading to the decrease in the

beam density.

In the scheme considered here both beams propagate in a crystal. Thus, an
adequate description of the stimulated emission with necessity must account for perticle
dechanneling and for photon attenuation.

Random scattering of the channeling particle by the electrons and nuclei of the
crystal leads to the gradual increase of the particle energy associated with the transverse
oscillations in the channel. As a result, the transverse energy at some distance, Ld, from
the entrance point exceeds the depth of the interplanar potential well, and the particle
leaves the channel. The quantity Ld is called the dechanneling length [25].

The dynamics of the photon ﬂux propagation, apart from the stimulation eﬀect, is
strongly inﬂuenced by a variety of processes occuring in a crystal. These are the atomic
and the nuclear photoeﬀects, the coherent and the incoherent scattering with electrons
and nuclei, the electron-positron pair production (in the case of high energy photons).
All these processes lead to the decrease in the density of the photon ﬂux as it propagates
through the crystal.

The rigorous treatment of the stimulated emission in the system “channelng beam +
photon ﬂux”, with both the dechanneling eﬀect and the photon attenuation accounted
for, must include solving the coupled equations of the Fokker-Planck form for the particle
beam [25, 32] and for the photon beam [60]. This will be done at a later time.
In
this paper we present the quantitative analysis of the stimulated emission by a beam
channeling in the AW bent crystal by using phenomenological arguments when treating
the dechanneling and the photon attenuation.

Let us ﬁrst estimate the role of the dechanneling eﬀect.

To simplify the expressions, we will only consider the stimulated emission of the
fundamental harmonic

ω =

4 ω0γ2
2 + p2 ,

and omit the index “1” in the notations ω1 and g1. Also, we restrict the treatment to
the case of a positron channeling, M = Z = 1.

By expressing the total number of the undulator periods Nu through the undulator

length, Nu = L/λ, and using (54a) and (54b), one gets the following estimate for g:

argument L in the notation g(L) stresses the dependence of the gain factor on the crystal
length.

Provided the dechanneling is neglected, one may unrestrictedly increase g by
considering larger L-values. In reality, the volume density of the channeling particles
decreases with the penetration distance, z, and, roughly, satisﬁes the exponential decay
law [25]

n(z) = n0 exp (

z/Ld(γ, R))

−

(58)

where n0 is the volume density at the entrance, Ld(γ, R) is the dechanneling length. For
given crystal and channel Ld(γ, R) depends on a positron energy (relativistic factor)
and on the curvature radius R.

As argued in [25], the decrease of n with z acquires the exponential form (58) at a
Ld(γ, R). If the crystal length is less than Ld(γ, R)
considerable penetration depth, z
then the dependence n(z) is strongly inﬂuenced by the initial conditions (the incident
angle, the beam divergency) of the beam impacting on the crystal. Therefore, for
estimation purposes, we set the length of the crystal equal to the dechanneling length,
L = Ld(γ, R), and assume that the beam density for z < L is equal to its initial value
n0.

The above consideration focused on establishing the role of the dechanneling eﬀect
in the process of stimulated emission. The main restriction due to the dechanneling
concerns the length of an undulator, which must be less than the dechanneling length,

Ld. This, in turn, results in narrowing the ranges of γ (eq. (67)), a (eq. (66)) and
ν for which stimulated emission can eﬀectively occur.

beam densities necessary to achieve a noticeable level of emission ampliﬁcation. From
the theory of FEL it is known that a model which considers a positron bunch as a
group of independent particles (which has been utilized above) is adequate provided the
following inequality is valid [61, 37]:

ωp τ < γ3/2

where ωp = (4π ne2/m)1/2 is the beam plasma frequency, and τ = L/c is the time of
ﬂight of the bunch through the crystal. The physical meaning of (74) is that τ is much
smaller then the timescale needed to develop collective instabilities within the bunch
due to its interaction with the undulator ﬁeld and that of the radiation [37]. Therefore,
all eﬀects due to the space-charge dynamics during the channeling can be neglected if
the volume density of the beam particles satisﬁes the condition

µ(ω) stands for the mass attenuation
coeﬃcient. These mass attenuation coeﬃcients are tabulated for all elements and for a
wide range of photon frequencies. For ¯hω > 1 KeV and up to 100 MeV the µ-values can
be found in ref. [54]. Figure 13 shows the µ(ω) dependences for various crystals. The
step-like behaviour of the curves for Si, Ge and W is due to the discontinuity of the
atomic photoeﬀect cross section in the vicinity of inner-shell thresholds. For photons of
energy less than 1 KeV the main contribution to the photon attenuation arises from the
atomic photoeﬀect process, and the µ(ω) dependence is easily deduced from ref. [59].

To provide an increase in the radiation intensity the gain must satisfy the condition

g > µ(ω),

(77)

which leads to further narrowing of the interval of photon energies. The large magnitude
of µ(ω) for ¯hω < 10 KeV (see ﬁgure 13) makes it almost impossible to obtain stimulated
emission in this ω-region even for crystals with small average atomic number.

To draw a conclusion on what type of a crystal and a plane is more suitable from the
viewpoint of its eﬃciency to amplify the spontaneous emission formed in an acoustically

based undulator let us make qualitative estimates of the density of a positron beam
needed to achieve the magnitude of 1 for the total gain.

Such a deﬁnition of the total gain is valid in the low-gain limit, G
Nevertheless, for estimation purposes, one may use (78) in the region G

Putting G = 1 and representing the quantity g(L) in the form g(L) = ˜g(L)

explicit expression for ˜g(L) is clear from (68)), we reach the following estimate for the

εmin = mc2γmin (the deﬁnition of γmin is given by (67) and its particular

where ˜a is deﬁned in (70). In (80) it is assumed that the AW amplitude a varies within
the interval a = [amin, amax], and both a and the AW frequency ν are subject to (64b).
The minimum value of the AW amplitude was chosen as amin = 10 d, the quantity
amax was calculated from (66) with the munimum number of the undulator periods
Nmin = 10. The magnitudes of the mass attenuation coeﬃcients, µ(ω), were obtained
by interpolating the data from [54].

For each curve in ﬁgures 14 the minimum value of the beam density is achieved at
a = a0 (see (71)) with the corresponding magnitude of the photon energy given by (73).
The only exception is the n(ω) dependence for a 250 MeV positron beam channeling
along the (100) plane in W (see ﬁgure 14(a)). In this case, due to the irregularity in the
behaviour of µ(ω) in the vicinity of the 1s atomic threshold (I1s = 69.5 keV for W ), –
see ﬁgure 13, – the minimum of the beam density is achieved at ¯hω

70 keV.

Figure 15 illustrates the extent to which the photon attenuation inﬂuences the
minimum value of the beam density. For each crystal (as indicated) the dependence
n(ω) from (79) is represented by the curves without full circles. The curves embedded
with full circles correspond to the function ˜n(ω) = [n(ω)]µ(ω)≡0, giving thus the minimum
values of the volume density which is needed to achieve the total gain G = 1 in the case
when the photon attenuation is totally disregarded. It is seen that for ¯hω

the role of the attenuation is negligibly small for all crystals, whereas for less energetic
photons it leads to a prominent increase in n.

Figures 14 and 15 show that to achieve a noticeable level of the ampliﬁcation of the
spontaneous radiation formed in the acoustically based undulator large magnitudes of
1022, are needed. This is mainly due to
1021
a positron beam volume density, n
the dechanneling eﬀect which imposes strong restrictions on the undulator length.

−

∼

These values of n, being high enough, are, nevertheless comparable with those

planned to be achieved within the TESLA project [62].

Therefore, we believe that the scheme described above may be considered as a new
feasible source for stimulated emission within the photon energies range from tens of
KeV up to MeV by means of the positron beam channeling in an acoustically bent
crystal.

6. Concluding remarks

Our investigation shows that a crystal, which is periodically bent by a transverse acoustic
wave, can be used for the construction of an undulator for a beam of ultra-relativistic
particles channeled in the lattice. The parameters of this undulator can be tuned by
varying the AW amplitude and frequency, the energy of the projectile, and by using
diﬀerent types of crystals and its channels. The suggested undulator can be used for
the generation of the radiation of high energy photons.

Also, it is shown that it is meaningful to discuss the possibility to create a powerful
source of a free-electron laser type stimulated radiation in the energy range of tens of
keV up to the MeV region.

We consider our present research as an initial milestone for more advanced
theoretical treatment of the problem. The goal of this further investigation is to achieve
more accurate quantitative description of the undulator radiation and the corresponding
laser eﬀect. In out opinion, on this way the following phenomena must be thoroughly
considered.

1. The AIR mechanism for a wide beam. When the wide beam enters the crystal it
is spread over many channels. Each channel is bent by the AW and, hence, one
must (when calculating spontaneous and stimulated emission) take into account
the photon ﬂuxes formed by these sub-beams. In this case the coherence eﬀect in
the photon emission can be enhanced due to the interaction of the photons with
the particles moving in many neighbouring channels. In the present paper we have
investigated the undulator and the laser eﬀects in a single channel.

2. Kinetics in the AIR problem. The more advanced description of the AIR problem
must take into account the kinetic behaviour of the particles in the beam as well as
kinetics of the photon ﬂux. Such a description will treat properly the dechanneling
mechanism, the attenuation phenomenon and the interaction of photons and
particles beams.

3. Dechanneling in a periodically bent lattice. It is necessary to study dechanneling in a
periodically bent channel in comparison with this eﬀect in a straight channel and/or
in a channel with constant (or/and slowly varied) curvature. So far nobody studied
dechanneling in a periodically bent channel (the AW bending). The dechanneling
length might increase as compared with the linear channel case. The dechanneling
length plays the crucial role for the laser eﬀect which we discuss in our paper (see
Section 5). Indeed, increasing of the dechanneling length by factor of 10 results in
decreasing of the channeling beam density, necessary for achievement of large gain
G, by the factor of 1000 (see eqs. (56) and (79)).
Let us stress here that special attention must be paid the problem of dechanneling
of a wide beam in a periodically bent crystal. Broadening of the channeled beam
in such a medium, which was not considered before, is important in our problem.
4. The bunching eﬀect. The eﬀect of the stimulation of photon emission can be
enhanced by increasing density n of the channeling beam. From the theory of
[63]) it is known that for high n large gain factors can
free electron lasers (e.g.
be achieved in the regime of collective instabilities in the beam (the bunching
eﬀect). In our future reaserch we plan to apply the results of the FEL theory to
the description of the laser-type radiation based on the AIR phenomenon.

5. Acoustic waves of various conﬁgurations.

In the present paper we investigated

50

spontaneous and stimulated AIR in an acoustically bent crystal considering
the most simple example of the acoustic wave,
the monochromatic plane
wave. However, other cases of AW (longitudinal waves, spherical waves, non-
monochromatic waves and various combinations thereof), interacting with the beam
of the channeling particles, are worthy to study. By applying the more complex
acoustic waves for the crystal bending one may construct an undulator with variable
parameters for the generation of high energy photons in a wide range. The use of the
crystal-based undulator with variable parameters may result in noticeable increase
of the gain factor for the stimulated AIR analogously to how it occues in the free
electron lasers based on the tampered magnetic wigglers [64].

6. Combination of the ordinary channeling radiation and the AIR. The present
consideration was focused on the case of the high amplitude AW (see (1)). This
allowed us to disregard the contribution of the ordinary channeling radiation to the
total spectrum of the emitted photons. More general approach must include both
radiative mechanisms, as well as their interference, simultaneously.

The rigorous treatment of the above outlined problems will be the subject of further

publications.

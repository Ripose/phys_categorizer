Abstract
The proposed linear electron-positron collider TESLA
is based on 1.3 GHz superconducting niobium cavities for
particle acceleration. For a center-of-mass energy of 500
GeV an accelerating ﬁeld of 23.4 MV/m is required which
is reliably achieved with a niobium surface preparation
by chemical etching. An upgrade of the collider to 800
GeV requires an improved cavity preparation technique.
In this paper results are presented on single-cell cavities
which demonstrate that ﬁelds of up to 40 MV/m are
accessible by electrolytic polishing of the inner surface of
the cavity.

Introduction

Linear electron-positron colliders for physics in the Higgs
and supersymmetric particle regime have to reach centre-
of-mass energies in excess of 500 GeV, and hence high ac-
celerating ﬁelds in the accelerating structures are needed
to limit the size of the accelerator complex. TESLA
[1] is the only collider project based on superconducting
cavities. In the 500 GeV baseline design (TESLA-500)
the accelerating ﬁeld, often called ”gradient” hereafter,
amounts to 23.4 MV/m. The 1.3 GHz nine-cell niobium
cavities for the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) linac have
achieved an average gradient of 26.1 ± 2.3 MV/m at a
quality factor Q0 ≥ 1 · 1010 in the most recent industrial
production of 24 cavities. The technology developed for

TTF is hence adequate for TESLA-500 but considerable
improvements are needed for an upgrade of the collider
to 800 GeV (TESLA-800). A detailed description of the
present status of the nine-cell cavity layout, fabrication,
preparation and tests can be found in [2].

The TESLA cavities (Figure 1) are made from 2.8 mm
thick niobium sheets by deep drawing and electron beam
welding. A damage layer of about 100 µm thickness has
to be removed from the inner surface to obtain an opti-
mum performance in the superconducting state. For the
TTF cavities this has been done so far by chemical etch-
ing, see below. Using an alternative preparation method,
electrolytic polishing (or electropolishing for short), sci-
entists at the KEK laboratory in Tsukuba (Japan) have
achieved gradients of up to 40 MV/m in 1.3 GHz single-
cell cavities [3]. This was the motivation for starting an
R&D program on electropolishing of single-cell cavities
of the TESLA shape. This program has been carried out
in collaboration between CERN, DESY and Saclay.

2 Niobium Chemistry

Niobium metal has a natural Nb2O5-layer with a thick-
ness of about 5 nm. Below this layer other oxides and
sub-oxides can be found [4, 5, 6]. Nb2O5 is chemically
rather inert and can be dissolved only with hydroﬂuoric
acid (HF). The strong acids used in the niobium surface
treatment like HF, HNO3 or H2SO4 play also an essen-
tial role for removing defects from the inner surface of
the cavity either by dissolving the foreign material it-
self or the surrounding niobium. Such defects may be
abrasive particles from grinding, imprints from the deep
drawing process, niobium protrusions from scratches or
dirt particles sticking to the surface. Cleaning the nio-
bium with chemical methods is the most practical way to
achieve a high quality superconducting surface. Chem-
ical or electrolytic processes can be applied to niobium
resonators if the safety and environmental standards re-
garding HF-containing acid mixtures are obeyed. Ni-
trous gases, oxygen and hydrogen are produced during
etching or electropolishing. A review of the preparation
methods of niobium cavities is given in [7].

2.1 Chemical etching

The sheet rolling of niobium produces a damage layer
of about 100 µm thickness which has to be removed in
order to obtain a surface with excellent superconducting
properties. The standard procedure is chemical etch-
ing which consists of two basic steps: dissolution of the
Nb2O5 layer by HF and re-oxidation of the niobium by a
strongly oxidizing acid [8, 9]. Then the new oxide layer
will be dissolved by the HF again. The most frequently
used oxidizing agent for niobium is nitric acid (HNO3).
The material removal rate in a mixture of HF (40%) and
HNO3 (65%) is large, of the order of 30 µm per minute
[9]. The reactions are strongly exothermic and can cause
a thermal runaway situation. Additionally, large quanti-
ties of gases (hydrogen, nitrous gases, HF) are produced.
For these reasons the mixture of HF and HNO3 alone is
not suitable for the etching of cavities.

To obtain a better process control a buﬀer substance
like phosphoric acid H3PO4 (concentration of 85%) may
be added [10]. Furthermore the mixture is cooled be-
low 15◦C which also reduces the migration of hydrogen
into the niobium lattice [9, 11]. The standard procedure
with a removal rate of about 1 µm per minute is called
buﬀered chemical polishing3 (BCP) with an acid mixture
containing 1 part HF, 1 part HNO3 and 2 parts H3PO4
in volume. Another possibility is to use concentrated
sulphuric acid (H2SO4) as a buﬀer [9, 12]. At TTF, a
closed-circuit chemistry system is used in which the acid
is pumped from a storage tank through a cooling sys-
tem and a ﬁlter into the cavity and then back to the
storage. The gases produced are not released into the
environment without prior neutralization and cleaning.
The cavities are rinsed with low pressure ultrapure water
immediately after the chemical treatment.

By now there exists compelling evidence that the BCP
process limits the attainable accelerating ﬁelds of multi-
cell cavities to about 30 MV/m even if niobium of ex-
cellent thermal conductivity is used. Typical accelerat-
ing gradients achieved with BCP in defect-free cavities
are shown in ﬁgure 2. Measurements on etched one-
cell cavities in other laboratories yielded similar results
[13, 14, 3]. Etched cavities exceeded 30 MV/m only in
rare cases [15, 16].

The etching process is accompanied with undesirable
eﬀects such as migration of hydrogen into the bulk nio-
bium and strong grain boundary etching. The ﬁrst eﬀect
can be reduced by cooling the acid below 15◦C [11]. In
principle, grain boundary etching could be suppressed
by using an acid mixture with a high etching rate. This,
however, would not be advisable in the nine-cell TESLA
cavity with an inner surface of about 1 m2 since the
large amount of produced heat would speed up the re-
action even more and preclude a well-controlled etching
process.

3The term “polishing” is not really adequate since the resulting
surface roughness is in the µm range and grain boundaries are
enhanced.

cavities with surface preparation by chemical etching
(BCP). The quality factor is plotted as a function of the
accelerating ﬁeld. Test temperature is 2 K.

2.2 Electrolytic polishing

An alternative method to etching is electrolytic polish-
ing or electropolishing (EP) in which the material is re-
moved in an acid mixture under the ﬂow of an electric
current. Sharp edges and burrs are smoothed out and a
very glossy surface can be obtained. The electric ﬁeld is
high at protrusions so these will be dissolved ﬁrst. On
the other hand, the ﬁeld is low in the grain boundaries
and little material will be removed here while in the BCP
process strong etching is observed in the boundaries be-
tween grains.

Electropolishing of niobium cavities has been known
for 30 years. The most widely used electrolyte is a mix-
ture of concentrated HF and concentrated H2SO4 in vol-
ume ratio of 1:9 [17]. A pulsed electric current was used
in a horizontal EP setup for superconducting niobium
cavities prepared at CERN in collaboration with Karl-
sruhe in 1979 [18]. A continuous method for horizontal
EP has been developed at KEK in 1989 [19].

The chemical processes are as follows [7, 20]:

2Nb + 5SO

−−
4 + 5H2O → Nb2O5 + 10H+
−−
4 + 10e

+5SO

−

Nb2O5 + 6HF → H2NbOF5

+NbO2F · 0.5H2O + 1.5H2O

NbO2F · 0.5H2O + 4HF → H2NbF5 + 1.5H2O

Most systems for the EP of accelerator cavities are hor-
izontal as shown in ﬁgure 3. The advantage is that the
produced gases (mainly hydrogen) are rapidly removed
from the wetted niobium surface [18]. Gas bubbles stick-
ing on the surface could lead to etching pits. In a verti-
cal setup these bubbles would move slowly upwards and
create axial wells. A drawback of the horizontal arrange-
ment is that the cavity has to be rotated. There is some
diﬃculty to achieve a leak tight rotary sleeve for the acid
mixture. In addition, the removal rate is reduced by a
factor of two since the surface is immersed only half of
the time in the acid to allow the hydrogen gas to escape
through the upper part of the beam tube.

2.3 Comparison of etched and elec-

tropolished surfaces

Micro-graphs of BCP and EP treated niobium samples
are compared in ﬁgure 4. One can see that EP smoothes
out the grain boundaries far better than BCP. The av-
erage roughness of chemically etched niobium surfaces is
of the order of 1µm [12] while EP surfaces are at least
one order of magnitude smoother, see ﬁgure 5. It should
be noted, however, that the measured unevenness of the
surface depends on the scan length of the atomic force
microscope. On a nanometer scale the roughness of BCP
and EP treated samples is comparable. This can be un-
derstood because at such small lengths the measurement
takes place on a single niobium grain. The main diﬀer-
ence between EP and BCP is the smoothening of the
ridges at grain boundaries which is measured only when
the scan length is suﬃciently large.

On etched surfaces the step height at grain boundaries
can be a few µm. Particularly large steps may occur at
the electron-beam welds at the cavity equator. For non-
optimized weld parameters steps as high as 30 µm have
been observed [21]. The steps at grain boundaries and
in the weld seams may lead to a magnetic ﬁeld enhance-
ment and a premature breakdown of superconductivity
[22]. This interpretation is corroborated by the obser-
vation that several chemically etched cavities exhibited
a quench in the region of high magnetic ﬁeld near the
equator weld without any indication of contamination by
foreign materials. It was possible to shift the quench po-
sition along the equator region by applying a new chem-

ical etching, but the maximum achievable ﬁeld was not
improved [23, 24].

An important question for electropolishing is of course
how much material has to be removed to achieve a
smooth surface. On electropolished samples the rough-
ness drops below 1 µm after 150 µm of material have been
removed. This corresponds to the thickness of the dam-
age layer which has to be removed anyway. Therefore an
electropolishing of at least 100 µm is a reasonable choice
both for surface smoothening and damage layer removal.

2.4 Description of the EP systems

2.4.1 Half-cell electropolishing

In the framework of the DESY-CERN-Saclay collabo-
ration a setup for the EP of half-cells was developed
at CERN. The goal was to investigate the viability of
a novel cavity fabrication and preparation concept: re-
moval of most of the damage layer by EP on simple
subunits and assembly of the multi-cell cavity from pre-
polished half-cells. An electrolyte developed at CERN
[25, 26] was used (see table 1) with a removal rate of
1 - 2 µm per minute. The electrode was made from cop-
per. An electropolishing of about 100 µm was applied
to the half cells. Then 4 one-cell cavities were electron-
beam welded at an industrial company with a standard
electron-beam welding apparatus (vacuum 10−5 mbar),
and 11 cavities were welded at CERN under much bet-
ter vacuum conditions (pressure in the welding chamber
below 10−6mbar).

Two of the cavities were tested immediately after weld-
ing and high-pressure water rinsing. Not unexpectedly,
the results were poor: the cavities reached a maximum
accelerating ﬁeld of just 8 - 10 MV/m with a strong
decrease in quality factor. A slight chemical etching
which would have been suﬃcient to dissolve a possi-
ble copper deposition on the niobium surface cured the
Q-degradation, however electron ﬁeld emission was still
present at low excitation implying that another contam-
inant besides copper was present. After a chemical etch-
ing (BCP) of 20 - 50 µm both cavities reached the stan-
dard performance (25 MV/m) of BCP-treated cavities.
The obvious explanation is that welding deposits on the
inner surface of the cavity must be removed by a BCP
or EP of 20 - 50 µm to arrive at a defect-free surface.

The conclusion to be drawn from these observations
is that the fabrication of a multi-cell cavity from prepol-
ished half-cells is indeed a viable concept which would
substantially reduce the amount of EP needed in the ﬁn-
ished resonator.

2.5 Electropolishing of complete cavities

A setup for the electropolishing of single-cell cavities was
built at CERN. The parameters were chosen similar to
those of the successful KEK system [19] and are summa-
rized in table 1. The essential diﬀerence is the cathode

material: pure aluminum at KEK and copper at CERN.
Both materials have their respective advantages and dis-
advantages. The copper electrode requires some care,
see below. The cathode is surrounded with tube made
from a porous PTFE4 cloth to keep the electrolytically
produced hydrogen gas away from the niobium surface.
Except for the cathode all components of the EP sys-
tem are made from plastic material which is inert against
the aggressive acid mixture. All parts in contact with the
HF should be made from ﬂuoroplastics such as PFA5,
PVDF6 or PTFE. The EP system is placed in a vented
area where the exhaust gases are pumped through a
neutralization system to avoid environmental hazards.
The acid mixture is contained in a closed-circuit. The
electrolyte is stored in containers cladded with Teﬂon
which can be cooled by water ﬂowing through Teﬂon-
covered piping. The volume above the electrolyte is ﬁlled
with dry nitrogen to avoid water vapour absorption by
the strongly hygroscopic H2SO4. The acid mixture is
pumped with a membrane pump through a cooler and
a ﬁlter with 1 µm pore size before it reaches the inlet
of the cathode. Then the electrolyte ﬂows through the
cathode to the center of the cell (see ﬁgure 3(b)). The
acid returns to the storage tank via an overﬂow.

The cavity is installed horizontally together with the
cathode and then the lower half is ﬁlled with the elec-
trolyte which attacks the niobium only very slowly when
no voltage is applied (etch rate less than 1 nm per hour).
After the equilibrium ﬁlling level has been reached, the
rotation is switched on and a leak check is done. Then
the current is switched on and the current-voltage char-
acteristic is measured. At a certain voltage (see table
1) current oscillations set in which are an indication
that two alternating processes take place: dissolution of
Nb2O5 by HF and re-oxidation by H2SO4. The best pol-

ishing results are obtained for an oscillation amplitude
of 10 - 15% around the mean value. The temperature
of the acid has to be around 30 - 35◦C during the EP.
Temperatures above 40◦C must be avoided as they result
in etching pits on the surface.

When the desired amount of material has been re-
moved, the current is switched oﬀ. The rotation is
stopped and the cavity is put into vertical position to
release the acid mixture. After rinsing with pure water
the cavity and the electrode are dismounted. Another
low-pressure water rinsing follows and the wet cavity is
taken into a glove-box with nitrogen atmosphere. Here
the cavity is rinsed with an ultrapure high-pressure wa-
ter jet to remove remaining chemical residues. A rinsing
with ﬁltered ethanol follows to speed up the drying pro-
cess. The cavity is then stored overnight in a vacuum of
10−3 mbar. Then the cavity is either rinsed with high-
pressure water for the performance tests at CERN or
ﬁlled with nitrogen gas and sent to Saclay or DESY for
high-pressure water rinsing and tests.

It should be mentioned that the copper electrode used
in the CERN system has a disadvantage. While the cur-
rent is ﬂowing, the copper becomes passivated but after
the current has been switched oﬀ copper ions can be dis-
solved and precipitate on the cavity surface. It has been
observed in a test that this leads to an increased resid-
ual resistance and to strong ﬁeld emission at low ﬁeld
(< 10 MV/m) [27]. To remove the copper deposition
the cavities are rinsed in sequence with HNO3 (60 %),
water, HF and water again. These steps are repeated
twice. The HNO3 dissolves the copper and oxidises the
niobium. Hydroﬂuoric acid removes the oxide layer and
several contaminants as indicated by our surface studies.
The overall material removal by this procedure is only
about 10 nm and does not deteriorate the smoothness of
the electropolished surface.

3 Measurements on electropol-

ished cavities

3.1 First tests

In their ﬁrst tests the cavities which were electropol-
ished in the CERN system showed an unexpected per-
formance limitation: the excitation curves exhibited a
strong degradation in quality factor at high ﬁeld as can
be seen in ﬁgure 6. Field emission of electrons could be
excluded as an explanation for the performance degra-
dation since neither X rays nor secondary electrons were
observed. Temperature mapping revealed a global heat-
ing in the areas of high magnetic ﬁelds around the equa-
tor indicating a rapid increase of the microwave surface
resistance towards high microwave ﬁelds.

In contrast to this observation, the excitation curves
of the EP-treated cavities at KEK showed only a mod-
erate drop of the quality factor and reached much higher
accelerating ﬁelds, see ﬁgure 7 [28, 3, 24].

Temperature map of an electropolished single-cell res-

surface. The heating of the surface (dark spots) takes
place near the equator in the region high magnetic ﬁeld.

At Saclay a similar strong Q degradation was observed
for chemically etched cavities [23, 14, 29], see ﬁgure 8.
The temperature mapping revealed a global heating of
the surface similar to that in ﬁgure 6b.
It was dis-
covered that the unsatisfactory performance could be
considerably improved by applying a moderate thermal
treatment to the ﬁnished cavity [29]. This will be called
bakeout (or in situ bakeout) hereafter. The procedure at
Saclay was as follows. After the last high-pressure water
rinsing the cavities were evacuated and then heated up to
170◦C for 70 hours. The remarkable observation was that
this low-temperature baking improved the quality factor
at the highest ﬁeld by nearly a factor of 3. This result
was conﬁrmed in other tests on BCP-treated cavities.
However, tests revealed also that the baking procedure
did not increase the maximum ﬁeld level in chemically
etched cavities [29].

have been performed under slightly diﬀerent conditions
(diﬀerent magnetic shielding in test cryostats and tem-
perature).

3.2 Application

of

low-temperature

bakeout to EP cavities

Building on the experience with BCP cavities at Saclay
and with EP cavities at KEK (where the bakeout at 85–
100◦ C had been part of the standard preparation) it
was decided to apply the bakeout to the EP cavities of
the CERN-DESY-Saclay collaboration. Figure 9 shows
that a dramatic improvement in performance is achieved:
several single cell cavities reach now accelerating gradi-
ents of up to 40 MV/m with quality factors above 5 · 109.
This behaviour is very similar to the observations made
at KEK.

The heat treatment of niobium cavities is a well-known
method to improve the performance. The temperature
is in general quite high though: the TTF cavities are
heat treated in an UHV furnace at 800◦C for hydrogen
degassing and stress annealing and afterwards at 1400◦C
for increasing the thermal conductivity of the bulk nio-
bium7. The surprising observation made with the bake-
out eﬀect is that a thermal treatment at such a low tem-
perature, where the diﬀusion of any gases dissolved in the
niobium lattice is extremely slow, has a major inﬂuence
on the high-gradient performance. It it obvious that only
the thin surface layer which is essential for the microwave
superconductivity can be modiﬁed by the bakeout.

3.3 High-ﬁeld performance at diﬀerent

helium temperatures

Figure 10 shows the excitation curves of an electropol-
ished cavity before and after the bakeout at helium bath
temperatures between 1.5 K and 2.2 K. At low ﬁeld the
quality factor exhibits the well-known temperature de-
pendence which is caused by the exponential tempera-
ture dependence of the BCS surface resistance (see be-
low). However, the maximum achieved gradient and the
7During this furnace treatment a titanium getter layer is evap-
orated onto the niobium surface which protects the niobium from
being oxidized by the residual oxygen in the furnace atmosphere.

perature was 1.5 - 1.7 K. (Courtesy K. Saito, E. Kako)

mal model calculations [30]. Only when the temperature
is in the vicinity of the Lambda-point (2.17 K) of liq-
uid helium, where the transition from the superﬂuid to
the normal-ﬂuid phase takes place, a degradation of the
quality factor due to insuﬃcient cooling can already be
seen at low ﬁeld.

3.4 High temperature heat treatments of

electropolished cavities

Electrolytic polishing generates hydrogen which can pen-
etrate into the niobium lattice. If too much hydrogen is
dissolved the danger exists that niobium hydride com-
pounds are formed if the material is exposed to tem-
peratures around 100 K for an extended period. These
Nb-H compounds have very high microwave losses and
may lead to a reduction of the quality factor by one or
two orders of magnitude. This unfortunate eﬀect has
been named Q-disease.

The typical hydrogen concentration in etched niobium
is in the order 100 - 400 atomic ppm hydrogen in the
bulk material and 4 atomic percent in a 50 nm surface
layer [11, 31]. A high temperature treatment at 800◦C
is very eﬀective in reducing the hydrogen concentration
to 3 atomic ppm in the bulk and ≤ 1 atomic% in the

7

surface layer.

The hydride formation depends on the dwell time the
cavity spends in the dangerous region around 100 K.
With a fast cooldown from 300 K to 4.2 K within 1 hour,
hydride formation will be reduced to an acceptable level.
The cavities studied in this work have been made from
electropolished half-cells. In the half-cell EP system the
niobium is not protected from the hydrogen gas by a
membrane. Therefore the danger of quality factor degra-
dation was to be expected. A dedicated experiment was
carried out to this end, the results are shown in ﬁgure
11. The electropolished and baked cavity was tested af-
ter a fast cooldown and showed the usual good perfor-
mance. Then the cavity was exposed to a temperature
of 100 K for 2 days. In the new test the quality factor
was very low and showed the typical strong ﬁeld depen-
dence described in [11]. In the next step the cavity was
heated in a vacuum furnace to 800◦C to remove the hy-
drogen from the bulk material. A short electropolish-
ing of about 20 µm was done to clean the surface from
dirt which might have been introduced during the fur-
nace treatment. Again the cavity was tested after fast
cooldown and showed the initial good performance. The
exposure of the cavity to the dangerous temperature of
100 K for 2 days was repeated. This time, however, no
Q degradation was observed, indicating that the forma-
tion of hydrides was strongly suppressed by the furnace
treatment. This is an important and encouraging result
which implies that no hydrogen will be introduced into
the niobium during a short EP if precautions are taken
(PTFE-cloth around the cathode) to keep the gas away
from the niobium surface.

Seven cavities received the furnace treatment at 800◦C
after electropolishing. Figure 12 shows the maximum
gradients before and after the 800◦C treatment. The
average gradient rises from 35 MV/m to 35.4 MV/m.

Finally, one electropolished cavity was subjected to the
1400◦C furnace treatment with titanium getter which is
part of the standard preparation of the TTF cavities (see
[2]). The idea was to check whether the increased ther-
mal conductivity would have a similar beneﬁcial eﬀect
on EP cavities as on BCP cavities. The residual resis-
tivity ratio RRR increased from 300 to 500. The cavity
reached the same maximum ﬁeld of 35 MV/m as before
the 1400◦C treatment, but at a slightly higher Q0. More
tests are needed to decide whether the 1400◦C furnace
treatment would constitute a signiﬁcant improvement of
the electropolished multi-cell cavities of the TESLA-800
collider.

3.5 Comparison of etching and elec-

tropolishing

The test results on etched single-cell cavities are consis-
tent with the performance achieved in the TESLA nine-
cell cavities. The average gradient achieved in the one-
cell cavities without any heat treatment is 24 MV/m. If

one evaluates the single-cell performance of those etched
nine-cell cavities which were tested after the 800◦C heat
treatment an average gradient of 23.5 MV/m is obtained.
The 1400◦C heat treatment which is routinely applied to
the BCP-treated TTF cavities raises the average gradi-
ent to more than 25 MV/m [2].

A summary of the performance after etching and elec-
tropolishing is given in ﬁgure 13. The average gradient of
the electropolished cavities is 35.7 MV/m. This is con-
vincing evidence that electropolishing leads to substan-
tially higher accelerating ﬁelds. One reason is certainly
that magnetic ﬁeld enhancements at grain boundaries
are avoided. Moreover, the smoother EP surface con-
tains fewer defects and is easier to clean from chemical
residues.

3.6

Inﬂuence of the electron-beam weld-
ing on the cavity performance

The TESLA cavities are made from deep-drawn niobium
half-cells which are joined by electron-beam (EB) weld-
ing. The quality of the EB weld seam at the equator
is crucial for the maximum ﬁeld achievable in the cavi-
ties. The one-cell production was made in two diﬀerent

Figure 14: Comparison of accelerating gradients of
cavities welded under standard vacuum conditions (≈
10−5 mbar) by the company ACCEL and under improved
vacuum conditions (< 10−6 mbar) in the electron beam
welding machine at CERN. The data for etched and elec-
tropolished cavities are shown. The best test on each
cavity is taken. One cavity of the CERN batch had a
macroscopic defect on a weld seam, which was found
during visual inspection. This cavity has been omitted
from the ﬁgure.

EB welding machines. The ﬁrst batch of 4 cavities was
produced by an industrial company with experience in
niobium cavity welding (ACCEL Instruments, Bergisch-
Gladbach). The second batch of 11 cavities was welded
at CERN with an EB welding machine equipped with a
stainless steel vacuum chamber conforming to ultra high
vacuum standards. Whereas the vacuum in the indus-
trial production is of the order of a few times 10−5 mbar,
the pressure in the CERN system could be lowered down
to 3 · 10−7 mbar by using a cryopump and a longer time
for pumping down.

As the residual gas in the machine is partly gettered
by the molten niobium in the weld seam, the residual
resistivity ratio RRR in this region can be degraded. For
an initial RRR ≈ 300 the reduction can be of the order
of 20% for a vacuum of 10−5 mbar 8. It can be expected
that the better vacuum conditions lead to an improved
cavity performance. The average gradient of the CERN
batch is in fact 3.8 MV/m higher as compared to the
cavities prepared under standard vacuum conditions (see
ﬁgure 14) 9.

The CERN EB machine is equipped with a 60 kV elec-
tron gun without the possibility to raster the electron
beam in a rhombic pattern across the weld which pro-
duces the smoothest underbead of the weld seam [1, 33].
The results in ﬁgure 14 indicate that the electron-beam
welding facility should combine a state-of-the-art elec-
tron gun and a UHV vacuum system. Such an electron-
beam welding facility is presently being commissioned at
DESY.

8For TIG (Tungsten-Inert-Gas) welds the reduction can be very
large (RRR ≈ 400 is reduced to RRR ≈ 120) [32]. In addition,
defects can be introduced using this welding technique.

9All cavities were treated in a vacuum furnace at 800◦C to

remove hydrogen from the niobium.

3.7

Inﬂuence of bakeout on the mi-
crowave surface resistance

In ﬁgure 15 the microwave surface resistance before and
after the low-temperature bakeout is plotted against the
inverse temperature. According to the BCS (Bardeen-
Cooper-Schrieﬀer) theory the surface resistance should
drop exponentially when plotted against Tc/T . For tem-
peratures T < Tc
2 and an energy of the microwave pho-
tons hf much less than the energy gap ∆, the surface
resistance can be approximated by:

RBCS(T, f ) = A

(1)

The factor A depends on material parameters like the co-
herence length ξ, the electron mean free path ℓ, the Fermi
velocity vF and the London penetration depth λL. The
BCS resistance of niobium at 1.3 GHz is about 600 nΩ
at 4.2 K and 10 nΩ at 2 K.

A reﬁned expression, derived from the two-ﬂuid model

of superconductors, is [34]:

BCS resistance is hence proportional to the mean free
path ℓ of the normal-conducting electrons and does not
assume its minimum for extremely pure niobium (ℓ very
large) but rather for somewhat “dirty” Nb with ℓ ≈ ξ.
If we make the assumption that the bakeout creates a
“dirty” surface layer with a shorter mean free path than
in the bulk niobium, then the residual resistance will be
larger and the BCS resistance will be lower than in the
unbaked cavity. Figure 15 shows that this is indeed the
case. The BCS part of the surface resistance is reduced
by a factor of ≈ 1.5 due to the bakeout while the residual
resistance increases. Similar observations were made by
Kneisel [35].

It should be noted that the resistance data are derived
from measurements of the cavity quality factor at low
ﬁeld (a few MV/m). The peculiar high-ﬁeld behaviour
of unbaked cavities, namely the strong Q degradation,
cannot be explained in terms of the BCS resistance be-
cause this quantity is independent of the magnitude of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the cavity. On the contrary,
a strongly ﬁeld-dependent resistance would be needed to
account for the rapid decrease of Q0 towards large gra-
dients. This eﬀect is not yet understood.

4 Conclusions and outlook

Electropolished bulk niobium cavities oﬀer accelerating
ﬁelds of more than 35 MV/m and are hence suitable for
the upgrade of the TESLA collider to 800 GeV. The sur-
face preparation by electropolishing has a deﬁnite ad-
vantage in comparison with chemical etching: a much
smoother surface is obtained and the ﬁeld enhancement
at grain boundaries is avoided. This magnetic ﬁeld en-
hancement may be the origin of a local premature break-
down of superconductivity in etched cavities. The physi-
cal and physico-chemical principles of the bakeout eﬀect
are not well understood yet and require further research.
Meanwhile, the ﬁrst multi-cell cavities have been elec-
tropolished in a collaboration between KEK and DESY.
The results will be published in a separate paper.

VLASOV-MAXWELL-POISSON EQUATIONS

Abstract
We present the applications of variational–wavelet ap-
proach for computing multiresolution/multiscale represen-
tation for solution of some approximations of Vlasov-
Maxwell-Poisson equations.

1

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider the applications of a new nu-
merical-analytical technique which is based on the meth-
ods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analy-
sis to the nonlinear beam/accelerator physics problems de-
scribed by some forms of Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equa-
tions. Such approach may be useful in all models in which
it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated prob-
lems related with statistical distributions to the problems
described by systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial differen-
tial equations with or without some (functional)constraints.
Wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathemati-
cal methods, which gives us the possibility to work with
well-localized bases in functional spaces and gives for the
general type of operators (differential, integral, pseudodif-
ferential) in such bases the maximum sparse forms. Our
approach in this paper is based on the variational-wavelet
approach from [1]-[10], which allows us to consider poly-
nomial and rational type of nonlinearities. The solution has
the following multiscale/multiresolution decomposition via
nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes

U k(x)V k(t),

(1)

u(t, x) = Xk∈Z 2
V k(t) = V k,slow

N

U k(x) = U k,slow

j ∼ 2j

V k

i t), ω1

i ∼ 2i

(t) + Xi≥N
(x) + Xj≥M

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all time/space scales.

Formula (1) gives us expansion into the slow part uslow
N,M
and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N, M. So, we may
move from coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest one
for obtaining more detailed information about our dynam-
ical process. The ﬁrst term in the RHS of formulae (1)
corresponds on the global level of function space decom-
position to resolution space and the second one to detail
space. In this way we give contribution to our full solu-
tion from each scale of resolution or each time/space scale

or from each nonlinear eigenmode (Fig.1). The same is
correct for the contribution to power spectral density (en-
ergy spectrum): we can take into account contributions
from each level/scale of resolution. Starting in part 2 from
Vlasov-Maxwell-Poisson equations we consider in part 3
the approach based on variational-wavelet formulation in
the bases of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear
eigenmodes.

equations leds to more clear understanding of the collecti-
ve effects and nonlinear beam dynamics of high inten-

3 VARIATIONAL MULTISCALE

REPRESENTATION

The ﬁrst main part of our consideration is some variational
approach, which reduces initial problem to the problem
of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and
some algebraical problems at the second stage. Multires-
olution expansion is the second main part of our construc-
tion. Because afﬁne group of translation and dilations is
inside the approach, this method resembles the action of a
microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each
scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of increas-
ing closed subspaces Vj:
...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂
V2 ⊂ .... The solution is parameterized by solutions of
two reduced algebraical problems, one is nonlinear and the
second are some linear problems, which are obtained by the
method of Connection Coefﬁcients (CC)[12]. We use com-
pactly supported wavelet basis. Let our wavelet expansion
be

f (x) = Xℓ∈Z

cℓϕℓ(x) +

∞

Xj=0 Xk∈Z

cjkψjk(x)

(7)

If cjk = 0 for j ≥ J, then f (x) has an alternative ex-
pansion in terms of dilated scaling functions only f (x) =
cJℓϕJℓ(x). This is a ﬁnite wavelet expansion, it can
Pℓ∈Z

be written solely in terms of translated scaling functions.
To solve our second associated linear problem we need
to evaluate derivatives of f (x) in terms of ϕ(x). Let be
ℓ = dnϕℓ(x)/dxn. We consider computation of the
ϕn
wavelet - Galerkin integrals. Let f d(x) be d-derivative of
ℓ (x), and
function f (x), then we have f d(x) = Pℓ clϕd
ℓ (x) can be expanded in terms of ϕ(x)

values ϕd

According to CC method [12] we use the next construc-
tion. When N in scaling equation is a ﬁnite even positive
integer the function ϕ(x) has compact support contained in
[0, N − 1]. For a ﬁxed triple (d1, d2, d3) only some Λd1d2d3
are nonzero: 2 − N ≤ ℓ ≤ N − 2,
2 − N ≤ m ≤
|ℓ − m| ≤ N − 2. There are M = 3N 2 − 9N + 7
N − 2,
such pairs (ℓ, m). Let Λd1d2d3 be an M-vector, whose com-
ponents are numbers Λd1d2d3
. Then we have the ﬁrst re-
duced algebraical system : Λ satisfy the system of equa-
tions (d = d1 + d2 + d3)

ℓm

ℓm

AΛd1d2d3 = 21−dΛd1d2d3,
Aℓ,m;q,r = Xp

apaq−2ℓ+par−2m+p

(11)

By moment equations we have created a system of M +d+
1 equations in M unknowns. It has rank M and we can ob-
tain unique solution by combination of LU decomposition
and QR algorithm. The second reduced algebraical system
gives us the 2-term connection coefﬁcients (d = d1 + d2):
AΛd1d2 = 21−dΛd1d2, Aℓ,q = Xp

apaq−2ℓ+p

(12)

For nonquadratic case we have analogously additional lin-
ear problems for objects (9). Solving these linear problems
we obtain the coefﬁcients of reduced nonlinear algebraical
system and after that we obtain the coefﬁcients of wavelet
expansion (7). As a result we obtained the explicit time so-
lution of our problem in the base of compactly supported
wavelets. Also in our case we need to consider the exten-
sion of this approach to the case of any type of variable
coefﬁcients (periodic, regular or singular). We can pro-
duce such approach if we add in our construction additional
reﬁnement equation, which encoded all information about
variable coefﬁcients [13]. So, we need to compute only
additional integrals of the form

ℓ (x) = Xm
ϕd
Z

λm =

λmϕm(x),

ℓ (x)ϕm(x)dx,

where λm are wavelet-Galerkin integrals. The coefﬁcients
λm are 2-term connection coefﬁcients. In general we need
to ﬁnd (di ≥ 0)

ZD

bij(t)(ϕ1)d1 (2mt − k1)(ϕ2)d2 (2mt − k2)dx,

(13)

where bij(t) are arbitrary functions of time and trial func-
tions ϕ1, ϕ2 satisfy the reﬁnement equations:

ϕi(t) = Xk∈Z

aikϕi(2t − k)

(14)

If we consider all computations in the class of compactly
supported wavelets then only a ﬁnite number of coefﬁcients
do not vanish. To approximate the non-constant coefﬁ-
cients, we need choose a different reﬁnable function ϕ3
along with some local approximation scheme

(Bℓf )(x) := Xα∈Z

Fℓ,k(f )ϕ3(2ℓt − k),

(15)

where Fℓ,k are suitable functionals supported in a small
neighborhood of 2−ℓk and then replace bij in (13) by
Bℓbij(t). In particular case one can take a characteristic

function and can thus approximate non-smooth coefﬁcients
locally. To guarantee sufﬁcient accuracy of the resulting
approximation to (13) it is important to have the ﬂexibility
of choosing ϕ3 different from ϕ1, ϕ2. In the case when D
is some domain, we can write

bij(t) |D= X0≤k≤2ℓ

bij(t)χD(2ℓt − k),

(16)

where χD is characteristic function of D. So, if we take
ϕ4 = χD, which is again a reﬁnable function, then the
problem of computation of (13) is reduced to the problem
of calculation of integral

H(k1, k2, k3, k4) = H(k) = ZRs
ϕ3(2ℓt − k2)ϕd1
1 (2rt − k3)ϕd2

2 (2st − k4)dx (17)
The key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort
of reﬁnement equation [13]:

ϕ4(2jt − k1) ·

2−|µ|H(k) = Xℓ∈Z

b2k−ℓH(ℓ),

µ = d1 + d2.

(18)

This equation can be interpreted as the problem of comput-
ing an eigenvector. Thus, the problem of extension of the
case of variable coefﬁcients are reduced to the same stan-
dard algebraical problem as in case of constant coefﬁcients.
So, the general scheme is the same one and we have only
one more additional linear algebraic problem by which we
can parameterize the solutions of corresponding problem in
the same way.

So, we use wavelet bases with their good space/time lo-
calization properties to explore the dynamics of coherent
structures in spatially-extended stochastic systems. After
some ansatzes, reductions and constructions we give for
(2)-(6) the following representation for solutions

u(z, s) = Xk Xℓ

U k

ℓ (z)V k

ℓ (s) = X U k

ℓ V k
ℓ ,

(19)

where V k
localized eigenmodes and z = (x, y).

ℓ (s), U k

ℓ (z) are both wavelets or nonlinear high-

Resulting multiresolution/multiscale representation for
solutions of (2)-(6) in the high-localized bases is demon-
strated on Fig.2.

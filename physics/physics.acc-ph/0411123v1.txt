Abstract

The long-term prospects for fully exploring three-ﬂavor mixing in the neutrino sector depend

upon an ongoing and increased investment in the appropriate accelerator R&D. Two new concepts

have been proposed that would revolutionize neutrino experiments, namely the Neutrino Factory

and the Beta Beam facility. These new facilities would dramatically improve our ability to test the

three-ﬂavor mixing framework, measure CP violation in the lepton sector, and perhaps determine

the neutrino mass hierarchy, and, if necessary, probe extremely small values of the mixing angle

θ13. The stunning sensitivity that could be achieved with a Neutrino Factory is described, together

with our present understanding of the corresponding sensitivity that might be achieved with a

Beta Beam facility.

In the Beta Beam case, additional study is required to better understand

the optimum Beta Beam energy, and the achievable sensitivity. Neither a Neutrino Factory nor a

Beta Beam facility could be built without signiﬁcant R&D. An impressive Neutrino Factory R&D

eﬀort has been ongoing in the U.S. and elsewhere over the last few years and signiﬁcant progress

has been made towards optimizing the design, developing and testing the required accelerator

components, and signiﬁcantly reducing the cost. The recent progress is described here. There has

been no corresponding activity in the U.S. on Beta Beam facility design and, given the very limited

resources, there is little prospect of starting a signiﬁcant U.S. Beta Beam R&D eﬀort in the near

future. However, the Beta Beam concept is interesting, and progress on its development in Europe

should be followed. The Neutrino Factory R&D program has reached a critical stage in which

support is required for two crucial international experiments and a third-generation international

design study. If this support is forthcoming, a Neutrino Factory could be added to the Neutrino

Community’s road map in about a decade.

Preface

In response to the remarkable recent discoveries in neutrino physics, the APS Divisions of

Particles and Fields, and of Nuclear Physics, together with the APS Divisions of Astrophysics

and the Physics of Beams, have organized a year long Study on the Physics of Neutrinos [1]

that began in the fall of 2003. Within the context of this study, the Neutrino Factory and

Beta Beam Experiments and Development Working Group was charged with reviewing, and

if possible advancing, our understanding of the physics capabilities and design issues for these

two new types of future neutrino facilities. To fulﬁll this charge, the working group conducted

a Workshop at ANL March 3–4, 2004. The presentations and discussion at this Neutrino

Factory and Beta Beams Workshop, together with the Neutrino Factory Design work of

the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration [2], form the basis for this report.

Over the last few years, there have been a series of workshops that have explored the design

and physics capabilities of Neutrino Factories. These meetings include the international

NUFACT Workshop series [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], many smaller, more specialized, workshops focused

on speciﬁc parts of Neutrino Factory design and technology, and two more detailed Feasibility

Studies [8, 9].

In addition, a large body of literature documents the physics motivation

for Neutrino Factories and the progress that has been made towards realizing this new

type of neutrino facility. The Neutrino Factory related goals for the working group were

therefore to (i) review and summarize the results of the extensive work already done, and

(ii) to update the picture utilizing the design study resources of the Neutrino Factory and

Muon Collider Collaboration, and the latest results from those making detailed studies of

the physics capabilities of Neutrino Factories. The Beta Beam concept is several years

younger than the Neutrino Factory concept, and the community’s understanding of both

the physics capabilities and the required design parameters (particularly the beam energy)

3

is still evolving. Beta Beam R&D is being pursued in Europe, but there is no signiﬁcant Beta

Beam R&D activity in the U.S. Hence, Beta Beam related goals of the working group were

necessarily more modest than the equivalent Neutrino Factory related goals. We restricted

our ambitions to reviewing the evolving understanding of the physics reach coming out of

work from Beta Beam proponents in Europe, and the R&D challenges that must be met

before a Beta Beam facility could be built. Possibilities for Neutrino Factory and Beta Beam

facilities seem to have caught the imagination of the community. We hope that this report

goes some way towards documenting why, and what is required to make these new and very

promising neutrino tools a reality.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrino Factory [10, 11, 12] and Beta Beam [13] facilities oﬀer two exciting options for

the long-term neutrino physics program. In the U.S. there has been a signiﬁcant investment

in developing the concepts and technologies required for a Neutrino Factory, but no equiv-

alent investment in developing Beta Beams. In the following we consider ﬁrst the Neutrino

Factory, and then the Beta Beam case.

New accelerator technologies oﬀer the possibility of building, in the not-too-distant future,

an accelerator complex to produce and capture more than 1020 muons per year [11]. It has

been proposed to build a Neutrino Factory by accelerating the muons from this intense

source to energies of several tens of GeV, injecting them into a storage ring having long

straight sections, and exploiting the intense neutrino beams that are produced by muons

decaying in the straight sections. The decays

oﬀer exciting possibilities to pursue the study of neutrino oscillations and neutrino interac-

tions with exquisite precision.

To create a suﬃciently intense muon source, a Neutrino Factory requires an intense

multi-GeV proton source capable of producing a primary proton beam with a beam power

of 1 MW or more on target. This is just the proton source required in the medium term for

Neutrino Superbeams. Hence, there is a natural evolution from Superbeam experiments in

the medium term to Neutrino Factory experiments in the longer term.

The physics case for a Neutrino Factory will depend upon results from the next round

of planned neutrino oscillation experiments. If the unknown mixing angle θ13 is small, such
that sin2 2θ13 < O(10−2), or if there is a surprise and three-ﬂavor mixing does not completely

describe the observed phenomenology, then answers to some or all of the most important
neutrino oscillation questions will require a Neutrino Factory. If sin2 2θ13 is large, just below

the present upper limit, and if there are no experimental surprises, the physics case for a

Neutrino Factory will depend on the values of the oscillation parameters, the achievable

sensitivity that will be demonstrated by the ﬁrst generation of νe appearance experiments,

and the nature of the second generation of basic physics questions that will emerge from

the ﬁrst round of results. In either case (large or small θ13), in about a decade the neutrino

5

community may need to insert a Neutrino Factory into the global neutrino plan. The option

to do this in the next 10–15 years will depend upon the accelerator R&D that is done during

the intervening period.

In the U.S., the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration (referred to herein

as the Muon Collaboration, or MC) [2] is a collaboration of 130 scientists and engineers

devoted to carrying out the accelerator R&D that is needed before a Neutrino Factory

could be inserted into the global plan. Much technical progress has been made over the

last few years, and the required key accelerator experiments are now in the process of

being proposed and approved. The 2001 HEPAP subpanel [14] recommended a level of

support that is suﬃcient to perform the critical accelerator R&D during the next 10–15

years. This support level signiﬁcantly exceeds the present investment in Neutrino Factory

R&D. In addition to the U.S. eﬀort, there are active Neutrino Factory R&D groups in

Europe [15], [16] and Japan [17], and much of the R&D is performed and organized as an

international endeavor. Thus, because a Neutrino Factory is potentially the key facility for

the long-term neutrino program, Neutrino Factory R&D is an important part of the present

global neutrino program. Indeed, the key R&D experiments are seeking funding now, and

will need to be supported if Neutrino Factories are to be an option for the future.

Consider next Beta Beam facilities [13], [18]. It has been proposed to modify the Neu-

trino Factory concept by injecting beta-unstable radioactive ions, rather than muons, into a

storage ring with long straight sections. This would produce a pure νe or ¯νe beam, depend-

ing on the stored ion species. The very low Q value for the decay means that the resulting

neutrino beam will have a very small divergence, but it also means that the parent ions

must be accelerated to high energies to produce neutrinos with even modest energies. The

baseline Beta Beam concept involves accelerating the radioactive ions in the CERN SPS,

which yields neutrino beams with energies of a few hundred MeV. The sensitivity of these

Beta Beams to small values of θ13 appears to be comparable with the ultimate sensitivity

of Superbeam experiments. Better performance might be achieved with higher energy Beta

Beams, requiring the ions to be accelerated to at least TeV energies. This requires further

study. This R&D is currently being pursued in Europe, where the proponents hope that a

Beta Beam facility together with a Superbeam at CERN and a very massive water Cerenkov

detector in the Fr´ejus tunnel, would yield a very exciting neutrino program.

In this report, we summarize the expected sensitivities of Neutrino Factory and Beta

6

Beam neutrino oscillation experiments, and the status of the R&D required before these

exciting facilities could become a part of the neutrino community’s global plan. Exploiting

the enthusiastic involvement of the Muon Collaboration in the study, we also describe an up-

dated Neutrino Factory design that demonstrates signiﬁcant progress toward cost reduction

for this ambitious facility. The report is organized as follows. Section II describes in some de-

tail the Neutrino Factory and Beta Beam design concepts. In Section III, Neutrino Factory

and Beta Beam properties are described and compared with conventional neutrino beams.

The neutrino oscillation physics reach is presented in Section IV. Progress on Neutrino

Factory designs along with some comments on the possibility of a U.S.-based Beta Beam

facility are discussed in Section V. The Neutrino Factory and Beta Beam R&D programs

are described in Section VI. A summary is given in Section VII and some recommendations

are presented in Section VIII. Finally, in Appendix A a cost scaling with respect to the

Feasibility Study-II cost numbers is presented.

II. MACHINE CONCEPTS

In this Section we describe the basic concepts that are used to create a Neutrino Factory

or a Beta Beam facility. Though the details of the two facilities are quite diﬀerent, many of

the required features have common origins. Both facilities are “secondary beam” machines,

that is, a production beam is used to create the secondary beam that eventually provides

the neutrino ﬂux for the detector.

For a Neutrino Factory, the production beam is a high intensity proton beam of moderate

energy (beams of 2–50 GeV have been considered by various groups) that impinges on a

target, typically a high-Z material. The collisions between the proton beam and the target

nuclei produce a secondary pion beam that quickly decays into a longer-lived (2.2 µs) muon

beam. The remainder of the Neutrino Factory is used to condition the muon beam (see

Section II A), accelerate it rapidly to the desired ﬁnal energy of a few tens of GeV, and store

it in a decay ring having a long straight section oriented such that decay neutrinos produced

there will hit a detector located thousands of kilometers from the source.

A Beta Beam facility is one in which a pure electron neutrino (from β+) or antineutrino
(from β−) beam is produced from the decay of beta unstable radioactive ions circulating

in a storage ring. As was the case for the Neutrino Factory, current Beta Beam facility

7

concepts are based on using a proton beam to hit a layered production target.

In this

case, nuclear reactions are used to produce secondary particles of a beta-unstable nuclide.

The proposed approach uses either spallation neutrons from a high-Z target material or

the incident protons themselves to generate the required reactions in a low-Z material. The

nuclide of interest is then collected, ionized, accumulated, and accelerated to its ﬁnal energy.

The process is relatively slow, but this is acceptable as the lifetimes of the required nuclides,

of order 1 s, are suﬃciently long.

A. Neutrino Factory

The various components of a Neutrino Factory, based in part on the most recent Feasibil-

ity Study (Study-II, referred to herein as FS2) [9] that was carried out jointly by BNL and

the U.S. Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration, are described brieﬂy below.

Details of the design discussed here are based on the speciﬁc scenario of sending a neutrino

beam from BNL to a detector in Carlsbad, New Mexico. More generally, however, the design

exempliﬁes a Neutrino Factory for which two Feasibility Studies [8, 9] have demonstrated

technical feasibility (provided the challenging component speciﬁcations are met), established

a cost baseline, and established the expected range of physics performance. It is worth not-

ing that the Neutrino Factory design we envision could ﬁt comfortably on the site of an

existing laboratory, such as BNL or FNAL. As part of the current Study, we have devel-

oped improved methods for accomplishing some of the needed beam manipulations. These

improvements are included in the description below.

The main ingredients of a Neutrino Factory include:

Proton Driver: Provides 1–4 MW of protons on target from an upgraded AGS; a

new booster at Fermilab would perform equivalently.

Target and Capture: A high-power target immersed in a 20 T superconducting

solenoidal ﬁeld to capture pions produced in proton-nucleus interactions. The high

magnetic ﬁeld at the target is smoothly tapered down to a much lower value, 1.75 T,

which is then maintained through the bunching and phase rotation sections of the

Neutrino Factory.

Bunching and Phase Rotation: We ﬁrst accomplish the bunching with rf cavities

bunching the beam, another set of rf cavities, with higher gradients and again having

decreasing frequencies as we proceed down the beam line, is used to rotate the beam

in longitudinal phase space to reduce its energy spread.

about 7 mm
·

Acceleration: A superconducting linac with solenoidal focusing is used to raise the

muon beam energy to 1.5 GeV, followed by a Recirculating Linear Accelerator (RLA),

arranged in a “dogbone” geometry, to provide a 5 GeV muon beam. Thereafter, a

pair of cascaded Fixed-Field, Alternating Gradient (FFAG) rings, having quadrupole

triplet focusing, is used to reach 20 GeV. Additional FFAG stages could be added to

reach a higher beam energy, if the physics requires this.

Storage Ring: We employ a compact racetrack-shaped superconducting storage ring

in which

35% of the stored muons decay toward a detector located some 3000 km

≈

from the ring. Muons survive for roughly 500 turns.

1. Proton Driver

The proton driver considered in FS2, and taken here as well, is an upgrade of the BNL

Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and uses most of the existing components and

facilities; parameters are listed in Table I. To serve as the proton driver for a Neutrino

Factory, the existing booster would be replaced by a 1.2 GeV superconducting proton linac.

The modiﬁed layout is shown in Fig. 1. The AGS repetition rate would be increased from

0.5 Hz to 2.5 Hz by adding power supplies to permit ramping the ring more quickly. No new

technology is required for this—the existing supplies would be replicated and the magnet

strings would be split into six sectors rather than the two used presently. The total proton

charge (1014 ppp in six bunches) is only 40% higher than the current performance of the

AGS. However, the bunches required for a Neutrino Factory are shorter than those used in

the AGS at present, so there is a large increase in peak current and concomitant need for an

improved vacuum chamber; this is included in the upgrade. The six bunches are extracted

with single bunches at an instantaneous repetition rate of 50 Hz (average rate of 15 Hz).

The average proton beam power is 1 MW. A possible future upgrade to 2

1014 ppp and

5 Hz could give an average beam power of 4 MW. At this higher intensity, a superconducting

bunch compressor ring would be needed to maintain the rms bunch length at 3 ns.

If the facility were built at Fermilab, the proton driver would be newly constructed. A

number of technical options are presently being explored [19],[20].

2. Target and Capture

A mercury-jet target is chosen to give a high yield of pions per MW of incident proton

power. The 1-cm-diameter jet is continuous, and is tilted with respect to the beam axis.

The target layout is shown in Fig. 2. We assume that the thermal shock from the interacting

FIG. 2: (Color) Target, capture solenoids and mercury containment.

proton bunch fully disperses the mercury, so the jet must have a velocity of 20–30 m/s to

allow the target material to be renewed before the next proton bunch arrives. Calculations

of pion yields that reﬂect the detailed magnetic geometry of the target area have been

performed with the MARS code [21] and are reported in Section V. The FS2 design was

updated for the present study to improve muon throughput. To avoid mechanical fatigue

problems, a mercury pool serves as the beam dump. This pool is part of the overall target

system—its mercury is circulated through the mercury jet nozzle after passing through a

heat exchanger. Pions emerging from the target are captured and focused down the decay

channel by a solenoidal ﬁeld that is 20 T at the target center, and tapers down, over 12 m,

to 1.75 T. The 20 T solenoid, with a resistive magnet insert and superconducting outer coil,

is similar in character to higher ﬁeld (up to 45 T), but smaller bore, magnets existing at

11

several laboratories [22]. The magnet insert is made with hollow copper conductor having

ceramic insulation to withstand radiation. MARS simulations [23] of radiation levels show

that, with the shielding provided, both the copper and superconducting magnets will have

reasonable lifetime.

3. Buncher and Phase Rotation

Pions, and the muons into which they decay, are generated in the target over a very wide

range of energies, but in a short time pulse (

3 ns rms). To prepare the muon beam for

≈
acceleration thus requires signiﬁcant “conditioning.” First, the bunch is drifted to develop

an energy correlation, with higher energy particles at the head and lower energy particles at

the tail of the bunch. Next, the long bunch is separated into a number of shorter bunches

suitable for capture and acceleration in a 201-MHz rf system. This is done with a series

of rf cavities having frequencies that decrease along the beam line, separated by suitably

chosen drift spaces. The resultant bunch train still has a substantial energy correlation,

with the higher energy bunches ﬁrst and progressively lower energy bunches coming behind.

The large energy tilt is then “phase rotated”, using additional rf cavities and drifts, into a

bunch train with a longer time duration and a lower energy spread. The beam at the end

of the buncher and phase rotation section has an average momentum of about 220 MeV/c.

The proposed system is based on standard rf technology, and is expected to be much more

cost eﬀective than the induction-linac-based system considered in Ref. [9]. A fringe beneﬁt

of the rf-based system is the ability to transport both signs of muon simultaneously.

4. Cooling

Transverse emittance cooling is achieved by lowering the beam energy in LiH absorbers,

interspersed with rf acceleration to keep the average energy constant. Both transverse and

longitudinal momenta are lowered in the absorbers, but only the longitudinal momentum is

restored by the rf system. The emittance increase from Coulomb scattering is controlled by

maintaining the focusing strength such that the angular spread of the beam at the absorber

locations is reasonably large. In the present cooling lattice, the energy absorbers are attached

directly to the apertures of the rf cavity, thus serving the dual purposes of closing the

12

cavity apertures electromagnetically (increasing the cavity shunt impedance) and providing

energy loss. Compared with the approach used in FS2, the absorbers are more distributed,

and do not lend themselves to being located at an optical focus. Therefore, the focusing

is kept essentially constant along the cooling channel, but at a beta function somewhat

higher than the minimum value achieved in FS2. A straightforward Focus-Focus (FOFO)

lattice is employed. The solenoidal ﬁelds in each half-cell alternate in sign, giving rise to

a sinusoidal ﬁeld variation along the channel. Use of solid absorbers instead of the liquid-

hydrogen absorbers assumed in FS2 will considerably simplify the cooling channel, and the

new magnet requirements are also more modest, since fewer and weaker components are

needed compared with FS2. Together, these features reduce the cost of the cooling channel

with respect to the FS2 design. Although the cooling performance is reduced, the overall

throughput is comparable to that in FS2 due to the increased acceptance built into the

downstream acceleration system. Here too, the ability to utilize both signs of muon is

available.

5. Acceleration

Parameters of the acceleration system are listed in Table II. A matching section, using

normal conducting rf systems, matches the cooling channel optics to the requirements of a

superconducting rf linac with solenoidal focusing which raises the energy to 1.5 GeV. The

linac is in three parts (see Section V B). The ﬁrst part has only a single-cell 201 MHz cavity

per period. The second part, with longer period, has a 2-cell rf cavity unit per period. The

third part, as a still longer period becomes possible, accommodates two 2-cell cavity units

per period. Figure 3 shows the three cryomodule types that make up the pre-accelerator

linac.

This linac is followed by a 3.5-pass dogbone RLA (see Fig. 4) that raises the energy from

1.5 to 5 GeV. The RLA uses four 2-cell superconducting rf cavity structures per cell, and

utilizes quadrupole triplet (as opposed to solenoidal) focusing.

Following the RLA are two cascaded FFAG rings that increase the beam energy from 5–

10 GeV, and 10–20 GeV, respectively. Each ring uses combined-function magnets arranged

in a triplet (F-D-F) focusing arrangement. The lower energy FFAG ring has a circumference

of about 400 m; the higher energy ring is about 500 m in circumference. As discussed in

SC walls of the cavities and solenoid coils are indicated in red. The dimension of the cryomodules

are shown in Table X and Table XI summarizes parameters for the linac.

FIG. 4: (Color) Layout of the RLA.

Section V B, an eﬀort was made to achieve a reasonably cost-optimized design. Without

detailed engineering, it is not possible to fully optimize costs, but we have employed general

formulae that properly represent the cost trends and that were considered adequate to

make choices at the present stage of the design. As the acceleration system was one of

the dominant cost items in FS2, we are conﬁdent that the approach adopted here will

result in a less expensive Neutrino Factory facility with essentially the same performance

as calculated for the FS2 design. Achieving a higher beam energy would require additional

FFAG acceleration stages.

After acceleration in the ﬁnal FFAG ring, the muons are injected into the upward-going

straight section of a racetrack-shaped storage ring with a circumference of 358 m. Parameters

of the ring are summarized in Table III. High-ﬁeld superconducting arc magnets are used

to minimize the arc length and maximize the fraction (35%) of muons that decay in the

downward-going straight, generating neutrinos headed toward the detector located some

3000 km away.

All muons are allowed to decay; the maximum heat load from their decay electrons is

42 kW (126 W/m). This load is too high to be dissipated in the superconducting coils. For

FS2, a magnet design was chosen that allows the majority of these electrons to exit between

separate upper and lower cryostats, and be dissipated in a dump at room temperature.

To maintain the vertical cryostat separation in focusing elements, skew quadrupoles are

employed in place of standard quadrupoles. In order to maximize the average bending ﬁeld,

Nb3Sn pancake coils are employed. One coil of the bending magnet is extended and used

as one half of the previous (or following) skew quadrupole to minimize unused space. For

site-speciﬁc reasons, the ring is kept above the local water table and is placed on a roughly

30-m-high berm. This requirement places a premium on a compact storage ring. In the

present study, no attempt was made to revisit the design of the FS2 storage ring. For

further technical details on this component, see FS2, Ref. [9].

The footprint of a Neutrino Factory is reasonably small, and such a machine would ﬁt

easily on the site of an existing laboratory.

B. Beta Beam Facility

The idea of a Beta Beam facility was ﬁrst proposed by P. Zucchelli in 2002 [13]. As the

name suggests, it employs beams of beta-unstable nuclides. By accelerating these ions to high

energy and storing them in a decay ring (analogous to that used for a muon-based Neutrino

Factory) a very pure beam of electron neutrinos (or antineutrinos) can be produced. As the

kinematics of the beta decay is well understood, the energy distribution of the neutrinos can

be predicted to a very high accuracy. Furthermore, as the energy of the beta decay is low

compared with that for muon decay, the resulting neutrino beam has a small divergence.

For low-Z beta-unstable nuclides, typical decay times are measured in seconds. Thus,

there is not so high a premium on rapid acceleration as is true for a Neutrino Factory, and

conventional (or even existing) accelerators could be used for acceleration in a Beta Beam

facility. Two ion species, both having lifetimes on the order of 1 s, have been identiﬁed as

optimal candidates: 6He for producing antineutrinos and 18Ne for neutrinos.

Following the initial proposal, a study group was formed at CERN to investigate the

feasibility of the idea, and, in particular, to evaluate the possibility of using existing CERN

machines to accelerate the radioactive ions. Their study took an energy of γ = 150 for

6He, which corresponds to the top energy of the SPS for this species and also matches the

distance to the proposed neutrino laboratory in the Fr´ejus tunnel rather well.

In the spring of 2003, a European collaboration, the Beta Beam Study Group, was formed.

Eventually, they obtained funding from the European Union to produce a conceptual design

study. Here, we take our information from recent presentations made by members of this

group [24].

The EU Beta Beam Study Group has undertaken the study of a Beta Beam facility with

the goal of presenting a coherent and realistic scenario for such a device. Their present

“boundary conditions” are to re-use a maximum of existing (CERN) infrastructure and to

base the design on known technology—or reasonable extrapolations thereof. In this sense,

the approach taken is similar to that of the Neutrino Factory feasibility studies.

For practical reasons, the Beta Beam study was included in the larger context of the

EURISOL study, due to the large synergies between the two at the low energy end. (The

EURISOL study aims to build a next-generation facility for on-line production of radioactive

isotopes, including those needed for the Beta Beam facility.)

FIG. 5: (Color) Proposed ion source system for production of 6He beam.

The basic ingredients of a Beta Beam facility are:

•

•

•

Proton Driver: A 2.2 GeV proton beam from the proposed Super Proton Linac

(SPL) at CERN would be used to initiate the nuclear reactions that ultimately generate

the required beta-unstable nuclides (6He is used as the antineutrino source and 18Ne

is used as the neutrino source).

ISOL Target and Ion Source: The target system is patterned after that of the

EURISOL facility [25]. For 6He production, the target core would be a heavy metal

(mercury [26]) that converts the incoming proton beam into a neutron ﬂux. Surround-

ing the core is a cylinder of BeO [27] that produces 6He via the 9Be(n,α) reaction. 18Ne

would be produced via direct proton spallation on a MgO target [28]. The nuclides of

interest will be extracted from the target as neutral species, and so must be ionized

to produce the beam to be accelerated. The proposed ion source technology, shown in

Fig. 5, is based on a pulsed “ECR-duoplasmatron.”

Acceleration: Low energy acceleration would make use of a linac to accelerate the

nuclide of interest to 20–100 MeV/u, followed by a Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS)

with multi-turn injection that would accelerate the ion beam to 300 MeV/u. This

system would feed the CERN PS with 16 bunches (2.5

1012 ions per bunch), which

×

18

would be merged to 8 bunches during the acceleration cycle to γ = 9. Finally, the
bunches would be transferred to the SPS and accelerated to γ ≈ 150, which corre-

sponds to the maximum magnetic rigidity of that accelerator.

Decay Ring: The racetrack decay ring would have the same circumference as the SPS

•

(6880 m), with a long straight section, some 2500 m, aimed at the detector. At the

ﬁnal energy, the lifetime of the beam becomes minutes rather than seconds. Stacking

is required to load the ring with enough ions to get an acceptable neutrino ﬂux.

The parallels with the Neutrino Factory are obvious. The main diﬀerence between the two

types of facility is in the initial capture and beam preparation. In the Neutrino Factory, the

beam must be bunched, phase rotated, and ionization cooled. In the Beta Beam facility, the

beam must be collected, ionized, and bunched.

1. Proton Driver

The proposed proton driver for the Beta Beam facility is the SPL, a 2.2 GeV Supercon-

ducting Proton Linac [29] presently being designed at CERN to serve both the LHC and

the EURISOL facility. The machine will operate at 50 Hz and will be designed to provide

up to 4 MW of proton beam power. The present scenario is illustrated in Fig. 6.

It is

anticipated that the ISOL target will require only about 5% of the proton beam power, i.e.,

about 200 kW.

FIG. 6: (Color) Baseline layout of the SPL facility at CERN.

19

2.

ISOL Target and Ion Source

As noted earlier, the target for 6He will use a water-cooled tungsten or a liquid-lead

core to serve as a proton-to-neutron converter. Surrounding this core will be a cylinder of

BeO, as shown in Fig. 7. In the case of 18Ne, a more straightforward approach will suﬃce.

The proton beam will impinge directly on a MgO target, producing the required nuclide

via spallation. An ion source capable of producing the required intense pulses is proposed;

development work on this device (see Fig. 5) is under way at Grenoble [30]. The device uses
a very high density plasma (ne ∼ 1014 cm−3) in a 2–3 T solenoidal ﬁeld and operates at
60–90 GHz. It is expected to provide pulses of 1012–1013 ions per bunch.

FIG. 7: (Color) Proposed ISOL-type target for production of 6He beam.

3. Acceleration

The proposed acceleration scheme is based on the existing CERN machines (PS and

SPS). Initial acceleration would be via a linac, followed by a rapid cycling synchrotron that

would be ﬁlled by multiturn injection. The RCS would provide a single bunch, 150 ns long,

at 300 MeV/u. The PS is a relatively slow machine, and this results in substantial radiation

levels due to decays while the beam energy, and hence the lifetime, is low. A rapid-cycling

PS replacement would be of considerable beneﬁt in this regard, though it is not part of

the baseline scenario. Another idea that merit consideration is the use of a FFAG, which

perhaps could be used to accelerate muons at a latter time.

20

The SPS space-charge limit at injection is another issue to deal with, and will likely

require a transverse emittance blowup to manage it. A new 40 MHz rf system will be added

to the existing 200 MHz system in the SPS to accelerate the beam to γ = 150.

4. Decay Ring

The beam is transferred at full energy to a racetrack-shaped Decay Ring having the same

circumference as the SPS. The length of the decay straight section (the one aimed at the

detector) is chosen to permit about 35% of the decays to occur there. At full energy, the

lifetime is minutes rather than seconds. This allows—and also requires—the beam to be

stacked in the Decay Ring to provide the required decay intensity. The proposed stacking

technique, asymmetric bunch merging, is based on somewhat complicated rf gymnastics,

but has already been shown to work experimentally in tests [31]. An interesting possibility

that has arisen only recently is the idea of storing both 6He and 18Ne in the ring simultane-

ously. This requires that the neon beam have the same rigidity as the helium beam, which

corresponds to γN e = 250. For a detector at Fr´ejus, the optimum energies [32] are γHe = 60

and γN e = 100.

III. BEAM PROPERTIES

the coming decades require the study of νe ↔

properties. We will begin by describing Neutrino Factory beams, and then describe Beta

21

Beam facility beams.

A. Neutrino Factory Beams

Neutrino Factory beams are produced from muons decaying in a storage ring with long

straight sections. Consider an ensemble of polarized negatively-charged muons. When the

muons decay they produce muon neutrinos with a distribution of energies and angles in the

muon rest–frame described by [33]:

Thus, for a high energy muon beam with no beam divergence, the neutrino and antineutrino

energy and angular distributions depend upon the parent muon energy, the decay angle,

and the direction of the muon spin vector. With the muon beam intensities that could

be provided by a muon–collider type muon source [11] the resulting neutrino ﬂuxes at a

distant site would be large. For example, Fig. 8 shows as a function of muon energy and

polarization, the computed ﬂuxes per 2

1020 muon decays at a site on the other side of the

the two terms cancel in the forward direction for all x. At low energies, the neutrino CC

However, if Eν is greater than

Using this simple form for the energy dependence of the cross section, the predicted energy

distributions for νe and νµ interacting in a far detector (cos θ = 1) at a Neutrino Factory

are shown in Fig. 9. The interacting νµ energy distribution is compared in Fig. 10 with the

corresponding distribution arising from the high–energy NUMI [35] wide-band beam. Note

that neutrino beams from a Neutrino Factory have no high energy tail, and in that sense

can be considered narrow-band beams.

We next consider the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino ﬂux. Since muon decay

kinematics is very well understood, and the beam properties of the muons in the storage

ring can be well determined, we expect the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino beam

intensity and spectrum to be small compared to the corresponding uncertainties on the

properties of conventional neutrino beams. In the muon decay straight section of a Neutrino
Factory, the muon beam is designed to have an average divergence given by σθ = O( 0.1

γ ).
The neutrino beam divergence will therefore be dominated by muon decay kinematics, and

uncertainties on the beam direction and divergence will yield only small uncertainties in

the neutrino ﬂux at a far site. However, if precise knowledge of the ﬂux is required, the

uncertainties on θ and σθ must be taken into account, along with uncertainties on the ﬂux

arising from uncertainties on the muon energy distribution and polarization. The relation-

ships between the uncertainties on the muon beam properties and the resulting uncertainties

on the neutrino ﬂux are summarized in Table V. If, for example, we wish to know the νe and

νµ ﬂuxes at a far site with a precision of 1%, we must determine the beam divergence, σθ,

to 20% (see, Fig. 13), and ensure that the beam direction is within 0.6

σθ of the nominal

×

direction [37] (see, Fig. 14). We point out that it should be possible to do much better than

this, and consequently, to know the ﬂuxes at the far site with a precision much better than

1%.

We now consider the event distributions in a detector at a near site, close to the Neutrino

Factory, which will be quite diﬀerent from the corresponding distributions at a far site.

There are two main reasons for this diﬀerence. First, the near detector accepts neutrinos

over a large range of muon decay angles θ, not just those neutrinos traveling in the extreme

forward direction. This results in a broader neutrino energy distribution that is sensitive to

the radial size of the detector (Fig. 15).

Second, if the distance of the near detector from the end of the decay straight section

is of the order of the straight section length, then the θ acceptance of the detector varies

with the position of the muon decay along the straight section. This results in a more

complicated radial ﬂux distribution than expected for a far detector. However, since the

dominant eﬀects are decay length and muon decay kinematics, it should be modeled quite

accurately (Fig. 16). Note that, even in a limited angular range, the event rates in a near

detector are very high. Figure 17 illustrates the event rates per g/cm2 as a function of energy.

Because most of the neutrinos produced forward in the center of mass traverse the detector

ﬁducial volume, the factor of γ2 present in the ﬂux for θ

0 is canceled and the event

the shielding between the detector and the storage ring would be 30 interactions per beam

1020 muon decays per year. These high background

rates will require clever magnetized shielding designs and fast detector readout to avoid

overly high accidental rates in low mass experiments.

B. Beta Beams

We now consider the beam properties at a Beta Beam facility. In a Beta Beam facility

the neutrinos are generated by the decay of radioactive nuclei rather than muons. The two

ions deemed optimal are 18Ne for νe and 6He for ¯νe production. The resulting initial neutrino

beam consists of a single ﬂavor. In addition, since the decay kinematics is well known, the

uncertainties on the neutrino energy spectrum are expected to be small. The electron energy

The neutrino ﬂux and energy distribution depend upon the boost γ, and hence upon the

energies of the stored radioactive ions. The original Beta Beam proposal [18] was to use the

CERN SPS to accelerate the ions. The desire to simultaneously store ions of both species in

the storage ring, and build a large detector in the Fr´ejus tunnel in France (which ﬁxes the

baseline), has led to proposed Beta Beam energies corresponding to γ

60 and 100 for the

∼

two ion species, yielding mean neutrino energies of 0.2 GeV and 0.3 GeV. Recently it has been

suggested that these energies are too low for optimal sensitivity to the interesting physics,

and hence higher energy scenarios are being considered, using the Fermilab Tevatron, or

the CERN LHC to accelerate the ions. Figure 18 shows the expected ﬂuxes for the three

scenarios, “low” energy (e.g., SPS), “medium” energy (e.g., Tevatron), and “high” energy

(e.g., LHC). Although the integrated ﬂuxes are similar, the cross section grows with energy,

yielding more events for the higher energies. Table VI shows the expected charged current

event rates for the three setups. However, it should be noted that the higher energy options

require both a TeV (or multi-TeV) accelerator and storage ring, which are expensive and

introduce additional technical challenges. Finally, further study is needed to fully explore

the systematic uncertainties on the beam properties of a Beta Beam facility. Note however,

that the neutrino beam divergence is controlled by the Q value of the beta decay, and the

beam divergence in the straight section. In the CERN (low energy) case, the typical decay

angle is 7 mrad. By contrast, the parent beam divergence would be O(100) µrad, assuming

a 200 m beta function in the decay section. For higher energies, both inherent neutrino

divergence, and the parent beam divergence scale like 1/γ. Hence the decay kinematics is

expected to dominate the beam divergence for all the Beta Beam scenarios. A more detailed

understanding of the systematics must await a detailed design for the storage ring and an

33

study.

IV. NEUTRINO OSCILLATION PHYSICS REACH OF A NEUTRINO FACTORY

AND BETA BEAM

Ultimately, to fully test the three-ﬂavor mixing framework, determine all of the relevant

neutrino oscillation parameters, and answer the most important neutrino-oscillation related
physics questions, we would like to measure the oscillation probabilities P (να →
function of the baseline L and neutrino energy E (and hence L/E) for all possible initial

νβ) as a

and ﬁnal ﬂavors α and β. This requires a beam with a well known initial ﬂavor content, and

a detector that can identify the ﬂavor of the interacting neutrino. The neutrinos interact in

the detector via charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) interactions to produce a

lepton accompanied by a hadronic shower arising from the remnants of the struck nucleon.

In CC interactions, the ﬁnal-state lepton tags the ﬂavor (β) of the interacting neutrino. To

accomplish our ultimate goal, we will need νe in addition to νµ beams, and detectors that

can distinguish between NC, νe CC, νµ CC, and ντ CC interactions. Conventional neutrino

beams are νµ beams, Beta Beams provide νe beams, and Neutrino Factories provide νe and

νµ beams. The sensitivities of experiments at the diﬀerent facilities will depend on their

statistical precision, the background rates, the ability of the experiments to discriminate

between true and false solutions within the three-ﬂavor mixing parameter space, and the

ability of the experimental setups to detect as many of the oscillation modes as possible.

In the following, we will ﬁrst consider the experimental signatures and sensitivities at a

Neutrino Factory, and then the corresponding signatures and sensitivities at a Beta Beam

facility.

A. Neutrino Factory Sensitivity

1. Wrong-Sign Muons

At a Neutrino Factory in which, for example, positive muons are stored, the initial beam

consists of 50% νe and 50% ¯νµ. In the absence of oscillations, the νe CC interactions produce

electrons and the ¯νµ CC interactions produce positive muons. Note that the charge of the

ﬁnal state lepton tags the ﬂavor of the initial neutrino or antineutrino.

muons). This is a very clean experimental signature since, with a segmented magnetized

νµ oscillations, the νµ CC interactions produce negative muons (i.e., wrong–sign

In the presence

35

iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for example, it is straightforward to suppress back-

grounds to 1 part in 104 of the total CC interaction rate, or better. This means that at a
νµ oscillation signal are extremely small. The full
Neutrino Factory backgrounds to the νe →
statistical sensitivity can therefore be exploited down to values of sin2 2θ13 approaching 10−4
before backgrounds must be subtracted and further advances in sensitivity scale like √N

rather than N. This enables Neutrino Factories to go beyond the sensitivities achievable

by conventional neutrino Superbeams, by about two orders of magnitude. A more complete

discussion of backgrounds at a Neutrino Factory can be found in Ref [39].

We now consider how wrong-sign muon measurements at a Neutrino Factory are used to

answer the most important neutrino oscillation physics questions. Suppose we store positive

muons in the Neutrino Factory, and measure the number of events tagged by a negative

muon in a distant detector, and then store negative muons and measure the rate of events

tagged by a positive muon. To illustrate the dependence of the expected measured rates on

the chosen baseline, the neutrino mass hierarchy, and the complex phase δ, we will ﬁx the

other oscillation parameters and consider an experiment downstream of a 20 GeV Neutrino
Factory. Let half of the data taking be with µ+ stored, and the other half with µ− stored. In

N(¯νe →

from global analyses of the atmospheric and solar neutrino data, they are the ones used for

the ﬁgure, which comes from Ref. [40], and are still useful to illustrate how the measurements

can be used to determine the oscillation parameters.) Figure 19 shows two bands. The upper

(lower) band corresponds to ∆m2

32 < 0 (> 0). Within the bands, the CP phase δ is varying.

At short baselines the bands converge, and the ratio R = 0.5 since the antineutrino CC cross

section is half of the neutrino CC cross section. At large distances, matter eﬀects enhance

R if ∆m2

32 < 0 and reduce R if ∆m2

32 > 0, and the bands diverge. Matter eﬀects become

signiﬁcant for baselines exceeding about 2000 km. The error bars indicate the expected

statistical uncertainty on the measured R with a data sample of 5

1022 kton-decays. With

these statistics, the sign of ∆m2

32 is determined with very high statistical signiﬁcance. With

×

an order of magnitude smaller data sample (entry level scenario [41]) or with an order of
magnitude smaller sin2 2θ13 the statistical uncertainties would be √10 larger, but the sign
of ∆m2

32 could still be determined with convincing precision.

In addition to the ratio of

wrong–sign muon signal rates R, the two energy-dependent wrong-sign muon event energy

distributions can be separately measured. To show how this additional information can help,

the predicted measured energy distributions 2800 km downstream of a 30 GeV Neutrino
Factory are shown in Figs. 20 and 21 for, respectively, νe →

hand, if δm2

32 < 0 we would expect to observe a higher wrong–sign muon event rate and

a softer associated spectrum when positive muons are stored in the Neutrino Factory than

when negative muons are stored. Hence, measuring the diﬀerential spectra when positive

and negative muons are alternately stored in the Neutrino Factory can both enable the sign
32 to be unambiguously determined [42], and also provide a measurement of δm2

of δm2

32 and

a consistency check between the behavior of the rates and energy distributions.

2. Other Channels

In practice, to measure θ13, determine the mass hierarchy, and search for CP violation,

the analysis of the wrong-sign muon rates must be performed allowing all of the oscillation

parameters to simultaneously vary within their uncertainties. Since the relationship between

the measured quantities and the underlying mixing parameters is complicated, with a min-

imal set of measurements it may not be possible to identify a unique region of parameter

space consistent with the data. For Superbeams a detailed discussion of this problem can be

found in Refs. [43, 44]. To understand the nature of the challenge, Fig. 22 shows, as a func-

tion of θ13, θ23, δ and the assumed mass hierarchy, the predicted number of wrong–sign muon

events when negative muons are stored in the Neutrino Factory, versus the corresponding

rate when positive muons are stored. The example is for a 16 GeV Neutrino Factory with a

baseline of 2000 km, and 10 years of data taking with a 100 kton detector and 2

the predicted rates vary as the CP phase δ varies. All of the CP conserving points (δ = 0

and π) lie on the diagonal lines. Varying the mixing angles moves the ellipses up and down

the lines. Varying the mass hierarchy moves the family of ellipses from one diagonal line to

the other. Note that the statistics are large, and the statistical errors would be barely visible

if plotted on this ﬁgure. Given these statistical errors, for the parameter region illustrated

by the ﬁgure, determining the mass hierarchy (which diagonal line is the measured point

closest to) will be straightforward. Determining whether there is CP violation in the lepton

sector will amount to determining whether the measured point is consistent with being on

complicated, since various combinations can result in the same predicted values for the two

measured rates. This is the origin of possible false solutions in the three–ﬂavor mixing

If these measurements are made when there are alternately positive and negative muons

decaying in the storage ring, there are a total of 12 spectra that can be used to extract infor-

mation about the oscillations. Some examples of the predicted measured spectra are shown

as a function of the oscillation parameters in Figs. 23 and 24 for a 10 kton detector sited

7400 km downstream of a 30 GeV Neutrino Factory. These distributions are sensitive to the

oscillation parameters, and can be ﬁt simultaneously to extract the maximum information.

Clearly, the high intensity νe, ¯νe, νµ, and ¯νµ beams at a Neutrino Factory would provide

a wealth of precision oscillation data. The full value of this wealth of information has not

been fully explored, but some speciﬁc things to be noted are:

1. It has been shown [45, 46, 47] that the various measurements at a Neutrino Fac-

tory provide suﬃcient information to eliminate false solutions within the three–ﬂavor

parameter space. Indeed the wealth of information in the Neutrino Factory data is

essential for this purpose.

the full calculations are shown in Fig. 26. The calculation is more fully described in Ref. [47].
The ﬁgure shows the minimum value of sin2 2θ13 for which three experimental goals could

be achieved (with 3σ signiﬁcance). First, the observation of a ﬁnite value of θ13. Second,

the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy. Third, the observation of non-zero CP

violation in the lepton sector if the underlying δ corresponds to maximal CP violation.

The three groups of bars correspond to three diﬀerent experimental scenarios, with diﬀerent

baselines. The favored scenario is the one illustrated by the bottom group of three bars, for

which there are two detectors, one at L = 7500 km and the other at L = 3000 km. Note

that:

At a Neutrino Factory sin2 2θ13 can be measured, the neutrino mass hierarchy
determined, and a search for CP violation in the lepton sector made for all
values of sin2 2θ13 down to O(10−4), or even a little less.

If sin2 2θ13 is fairly large, Superbeam experiments may also establish its value, and perhaps

determine the mass hierarchy and begin the search for CP violation. Figure 27 illustrates
the role of a Neutrino Factory over a broad range of sin2 2θ13 values. The ﬁgure shows,
as a function of the underlying value of sin2 2θ13, the 1σ precision on the determination of

sensitivity.

In addition, Bueno et al. [49] have shown that the energy dependencies of

matter and CP violating eﬀects are diﬀerent, and can be exploited to further separate the
two eﬀects. For sin2 2θ13 > 0.01, the case for a Neutrino Factory will depend upon just

how well Superbeam experiments will ultimately be able to do, whether any new discoveries

are made along the way that complicate the analysis, whether any theoretical progress is

made along the way that leads to an emphasis on the type of measurements that a Neutrino

Factory excels at, how important further tests of the oscillation formalism is in general, and
the importance of observing and measuring νe →

ντ oscillations in particular.

We conclude there is a strong physics case for a Neutrino Factory if sin2 2θ13
0.01. There may also be a strong case if sin2 2θ13 is larger than this,

4. Special Case: θ13 = 0

The case θ13 = 0 is very special. The number of mixing angles needed to describe the

3

3 unitary neutrino mixing matrix would be reduced from three to two, suggesting the

×

existence of a new conservation law resulting in an additional constraint on the elements

of the mixing matrix. The discovery of a new conservation law happens rarely in physics,

and almost always leads to revolutionary insights in our understanding of how the physical

universe works. Hence, if it were possible to establish that θ13 = 0, it would be a major

discovery. Note that in the limit θ13

0, the oscillation probability for νe ↔

is ﬁnite, and is given by:

where the matter parameter A = 1 if the neutrino energy corresponds to the matter reso-

nance, which for a long-baseline terrestrial experiment means neutrino energies E

12 GeV.

In addition, if the baseline L is chosen such that L/E corresponds to the oscillation maxi-
mum, then sin2 ∆ = 1, and we have that

Substituting into this expression values for the oscillation parameters that are consistent with

the present solar and atmospheric neutrino data, we are led to conclude that even if θ13 = 0,
provided the neutrino energy and baseline are chosen appropriately, νe ↔
νµ transitions are
still directly observable in an appearance experiment if oscillation probabilities of O(10−4)

are observable. Hence, if θ13 is very small, the ideal neutrino oscillation experiment will be

a long baseline experiment that uses neutrinos with energies close to 12 GeV, i.e., uses a

baseline such that L/E corresponds to the oscillation maximum, and is sensitive to values of
10−4 or smaller. Neutrino Factories provide the only way we know to satisfy
P (νe ↔
these experimental requirements.

If θ13 = 0 a Neutrino Factory experiment would enable (i) the ﬁrst observation

48

These are major experimental results that would simultaneously provide a ﬁnal conﬁrma-

tion the three-ﬂavor mixing framework (by establishing νe ↔
experiment) while strongly suggesting the existence of a new conservation law. In consid-

ering the case θ13 = 0, it should be noted that within the framework of GUT theories,
radiative corrections will change the value of sin2 2θ13 measured in the laboratory from the
underlying value of sin2 2θ13 at the GUT scale. Recent calculations [53] have suggested
that these radiative corrections to sin2 2θ13 will be O(10−4). If this is the case, the ultimate
Neutrino Factory experiment would not only provide the ﬁrst direct observation of νe →

These would be tremendously important results.

B. Beta Beam Calculations and Results

The Beta Beam concept is more recent than the Neutrino Factory idea, and the perfor-
mance of Beta Beam experiments is less well established. Recent calculations of the sin2 2θ13

sensitivity for low energy Beta Beam scenarios [54] have included the eﬀects of systematic

uncertainties, correlations, and false solutions in parameter space. Expected signal and

background rates are summarized in Table VII. The expected signal rates are relatively

modest. The neutrino Beta Beam signal would be a factor of 2–3 less than expected at a

high–performance Superbeam, and a factor of 14 less than at a Neutrino Factory. The rates

are even lower for an antineutrino Beta Beam; a factor of 20 less than the rates at a high–

performance Superbeam, and a factor of 32 less than at a Neutrino Factory. In addition, it

has been pointed out [38] that the neutrino energies are comparable to the target nucleon

kinetic energies due to Fermi motion, and therefore there is no useful spectral information

in the low energy Beta Beam measurements. Hence, the useful information is restricted to

49

the measured muon neutrino (and antineutrino) appearance rates. Nevertheless, the sig-

nal/background ratios are good: 12.5 for the neutrino Beta Beam (compared with 6.2 for

the Superbeam and 735 for the Neutrino Factory), and an impressive 478 for the antineu-

trino Beta Beam (compared with 2.8 for the Superbeam and 85 for the Neutrino Factory).

Hence the interest in Beta Beams. The ability of a low-energy Beta Beam to discover a

ﬁnite value for sin2 2θ13 is compared in Fig. 28 with the corresponding 3σ sensitivities at a

Neutrino Factory and high performance Superbeam. The leftmost limits of each of the bars

in Fig. 28 show the statistical sensitivities, and the shaded regions within the bars show

the degradation of the sensitivities due to irreducible experimental systematics, the eﬀects

of correlations, and the eﬀects of false solutions in the three-ﬂavor mixing parameter space.

The rightmost limit of the bars therefore gives the expected sensitivities for each experiment.

The sensitivity of the low–energy Beta Beam experiment is expected to be comparable to

the corresponding Superbeam sensitivity. A Neutrino Factory would improve on the Beta

Beam sensitivity by about a factor of 40. Combining low-energy Beta Beam results (the

two measured rates) with Superbeam results would enable the impact of correlations and
ambiguities to be reduced, which would potentially enable an improvement in the sin2 2θ13

sensitivity by a factor of 2–3 over the standalone results. Hence, low energy Beta Beams
oﬀer only a modest improvement in the sin2 2θ13 sensitivity beyond that achievable with

a high–performance Superbeam, and this realization has led to the consideration of higher

energy Beta Beams [38]. In particular, it has been proposed that the energies be increased

by at least a factor of a few so that the neutrino and antineutrino energies are well above the

Fermi motion region, which would enable useful spectral information to be extracted from

the Beta Beam measurements. In addition, this would increase the signal rates (Table VI),

and if the energy were suﬃciently high to result in signiﬁcant matter eﬀects, then it would

be possible (if θ13 is suﬃciently large) to use Beta Beams to determine the neutrino mass

hierarchy. The particular scenarios that have been considered [38] are:

Low Energy Beta Beam: This is the standard CERN scenario using the SPS for acceler-

ation, and a 1 megaton water Cerenkov detector in the Fr´ejus tunnel (γ = 60, L =

130 km).

L = 730 km).

= 3000 km.

Medium Energy Beta Beam: This would require the Fermilab Tevatron (or equivalent) for

acceleration, and a 1 megaton water Cerenkov detector in the Soudan mine (γ = 350,

High Energy Beta Beam: This would require the LHC for acceleration, with γ = 1500, L

In all three cases, the running time is assumed to be 10 years. The improvement in statistical

precision enabled by the higher energy Beta Beam scenarios is illustrated in Table VI and

Fig. 29. The ﬁgure shows, for the three scenarios, the 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ contours in the (θ13, δ)–

plane. Note that the expected sensitivity for the medium energy case with a “small” water

Cerenkov detector is comparable to the low energy case with the megaton water Cerenkov

detector. However, the medium energy sensitivity is dramatically improved with the much

bigger detector. The further improvement obtained by going to LHC energies seems to

be marginal. Given the likelihood that the LHC would not be available as a Beta Beam

accelerator for a very long time, perhaps the most interesting scenario is the medium energy

one. To understand the ability of medium energy Beta Beams to establish a ﬁnite value

for θ13, determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, and search for CP violation in the lepton

sector, the full analysis must be performed, taking care of all known systematic eﬀects, and

the impact of correlations and degeneracies. Although this full analysis has not yet been

done, a step towards it has been made, and the results are encouraging. Figure 30 shows the

region of the (θ13, δ)–plane within which sin δ = 1 (maximal CP violation) can be separated

is within a factor of a few of the expected sensitivity that can be achieved at a Neutrino

Factory. It will be interesting to see if this calculated medium energy Beta Beam sensitivity

is signiﬁcantly degraded when the uncertainties on all the oscillation parameters and the

systematic uncertainties on the neutrino cross sections, etc., are included in the calculation.

Finally, Fig. 31 shows, for the medium energy Beta Beam scenario, the region of the (θ13, δ)–

V. PROGRESS ON NEUTRINO FACTORY AND BETA BEAM FACILITY DE-

SIGN

In this Section we describe the technical work accomplished as part of the present Study.

For the Neutrino Factory (Sections V A and V B) our focus was to update the FS2 design with

some of the more cost-eﬀective approaches we have studied. In particular, a more optimized

capture section was designed, a shorter and less expensive bunching and phase rotation

scheme was developed, and a more optimized acceleration scheme based on a combination

of RLA and FFAG rings was worked out. Based on the improved designs presented here,

we worked out approximately what the savings with respect to FS2 costs were. This is

described in the Appendix.

For the Beta Beam facility, we have taken a brief look in Section V C at the implications of

using existing U.S. accelerator facilities at BNL and Fermilab to provide the required beams.

There is a real motivation to explore this idea, because it appears that there are signiﬁcant

scientiﬁc beneﬁts associated with producing the neutrino beams from a Beta Beam facility

at higher energy than would be possible at CERN in the foreseeable future.

A. Neutrino Factory Front End

The front end of the neutrino factory (the part of the facility between the target and

the ﬁrst linear accelerator) represented a large fraction of the total facility costs in FS2 [9].

However, several recent developments have given hope that a new design for the front end

may be possible that is signiﬁcantly less expensive:

A new approach to bunching and phase rotation using the concept of adiabatic rf

bunching [55, 56, 57, 58, 59] eliminates the very expensive induction linacs used in

For a moderate cost, the transverse acceptance of the accelerator chain could be dou-

bled from its FS2 value.

This diminished the demands on the transverse ionization cooling section and allowed

the design of a simpliﬁed cooler with fewer components and reduced magnetic ﬁeld

We denote as “Study 2a” the simulations that have been made of the performance of this new

front end, together with the new scheme for acceleration. The Monte Carlo simulations were

FIG. 32: (Color) Comparison of the buncher concept used here with the bunching system used in

the system used in FS2 in Fig. 32. The longitudinal phase space after the target is the same

in both cases. Initially, there is a small spread in time, but a very large spread in energy. The

target is followed by a drift space in both cases, where a strong correlation develops between

time and energy. In FS2, the energy spread in the correlated beam was ﬁrst ﬂattened using

a series of induction linacs. The induction linacs did an excellent job, reducing the ﬁnal rms

energy spread to 4.4%. The beam was then sent through a series of rf cavities for bunching,

55

which increased the energy spread to

8%. In the new scheme, the correlated beam is ﬁrst

adiabatically bunched using a series of rf cavities with decreasing frequencies and increasing

gradients. The beam is then phase rotated with a second string of rf cavities with decreasing

frequencies and constant gradient. The ﬁnal rms energy spread in the new design is 10.5%.

the new front end is 295 m. The longitudinal ﬁeld component on-axis is shown for the full

front-end in Fig. 34. The ﬁeld falls very rapidly in the collection region to a value of 1.75 T.

≈

≈

It keeps this value with very little ripple over the decay, buncher and rotator regions. After

a short matching section, the 1.75 T ﬁeld is changed adiabatically to the alternating ﬁeld

used in the cooler. The beam distributions used in the simulations were generated using

MARS [21]. The distribution is calculated for a 24 GeV proton beam interacting with a

Hg jet [61]. The jet is incident at an angle of 100 mrad to the solenoid axis, while the beam

is incident at an angle of 67 mrad to the solenoid axis. An independent study showed that

the resulting 33 mrad crossing angle gives near-peak acceptance for the produced pions. An

examination of particles that were propagated to the end of the front-end channel shows that

they have a peak initial longitudinal momentum of

300 MeV/c with a long high-energy

tail, and a peak initial transverse momentum

180 MeV/c. We used an improved axial

ﬁeld proﬁle in the capture region that increased the ﬁnal number of muons per proton in

≈

in Fig. 35 with the proﬁle used in FS2. Figure 36 shows the actual coil conﬁguration in the

collection region. The end of the 60 cm long target region is deﬁned as z = 0. The three

small radius coils near z = 0 are Cu coils, while the others are superconducting. The left axis

shows the error ﬁeld on-axis compared with the desired ﬁeld proﬁle. We see that the peak

error ﬁeld is

0.07 T. Figure 37 shows a MARS calculation of the absorbed radiation dose

≈

in the collection region. The peak deposition in the superconducting coils is

1 Mgy/yr

for a 1 MW beam running for 1 Snowmass year of 107 s. Assuming a lifetime dose for the

≈

insulation of 100 Mgy, there should be no problem with radiation damage in the coils.

Two cells of the buncher lattice are shown schematically in Fig. 38. Most of the 75 cm

cell length is occupied by the 50-cm-long rf cavity. The cavity iris is covered with a Be

window. The limiting radial aperture in the cell is determined by the 25 cm radius of the

window. The 50-cm-long solenoid was placed outside the rf cavity in order to decrease the

magnetic ﬁeld ripple on the axis and minimize beam losses from momentum stop bands.

The buncher section contains 27 cavities with 13 discrete frequencies and gradients varying

from 5–10 MV/m.

The frequencies decrease from 333 to 234 MHz in the buncher region. The cavities are not

equally spaced. Fewer cavities are used at the beginning where the required gradients are

small. Figure 39 shows the correlated longitudinal phase space and the bunching produced

by the buncher.

The rotator cell is very similar to the buncher cell. The major diﬀerence is the use of

tapered Be windows on the cavities because of the higher rf gradient. There are 72 cavities

in the rotator region, with 15 diﬀerent frequencies. The frequencies decrease from 232 to

201 MHz in this part of the front end. All cavities have a gradient of 12.5 MV/m. The

energy spread in the beam is signiﬁcantly reduced. The cooling channel was designed to have

channel is shown in Fig. 40. Most of the 150 cm cell length is taken up by the 50-cm-long rf

cavities. The cavities have a frequency of 201.25 MHz and a gradient of 15.25 MV/m. A novel

aspect of this design comes from using the windows on the rf cavity as the cooling absorbers.

This is possible because the near constant β function does not signiﬁcantly increase the

emittance heating at the window location. The window consists of a 1 cm thickness of

LiH with 25 µm thick Be coatings (The Be will, in turn, have a thin coating of TiN to

prevent multipactoring [62].) The alternating 2.8 T solenoidal ﬁeld is produced with one

solenoid per half cell, located between the rf cavities. Figure 41 shows the longitudinal phase

space at the end of the cooling section. The reduction in normalized transverse emittance

along the cooling channel is shown in the left plot of Fig. 42 and the right plot shows the

normalized longitudinal emittance. The channel produces a ﬁnal value of ǫT = 7.1 mm

shorter, and presumably less expensive channel design. In addition, unlike FS2, this channel

transmits both signs of muons produced at the target. With appropriate modiﬁcations to

the transport line going into the storage ring, this design could deliver both (time tagged)

neutrinos and antineutrinos to the detector. The beam at the end of the cooling section

consists of a train of bunches (one sign) with a varying population of muons in each one; this

is shown in Fig. 44. Figure 45 depicts the longitudinal phase space of one of the bunches

1. Other Variants

The present scenario is not completely optimized in either performance or cost. In this

section we discuss some of the options that have already been studied brieﬂy or that might

be developed in future studies. Some variations we have considered:

Shorter buncher rotator

Shorter bunch train

Diﬀerent rf frequency

Gas-ﬁlled cavities

total energy loss the same as that in the baseline foil + LiH absorber case. This would

eliminate the need for thin Be windows. Cooling would be a bit less eﬀective because of the

greater multiple scattering in Be absorbers. An initial evaluation [63] of a Be-only scenario
showed somewhat less capture into the acceleration channel acceptance (≈15%). A scenario

in which Be absorbers are initially installed and then upgraded later to more eﬃcient LiH

absorbers is, of course, also possible.

The baseline scenario requires a roughly 110 m drift, a 51 m buncher and a 52 m high-

voltage phase rotation section. These parameters have not been optimized. For comparison,

we considered an example having only a 26 m phase rotation section [63]. The shorter

rotation section would be signiﬁcantly less expensive since it is not only shorter but pro-

vides about 200 MV less of high-gradient rf voltage. Initial evaluations indicate only small
decreases in captured muons (≈10%).

The baseline case generates µ+ and µ− bunch trains that are about 100 m long. These

bunch trains are matched to the FS2 scenario requirements; in particular, they ﬁt within

the circumferences of the FS2, and the presently envisioned, accelerators and storage ring.

65

However, other scenarios might make use of smaller circumference ring coolers, accelerators,

and storage rings, and thus require shorter bunch trains. For example, a scenario with a

20 m drift, 20 m buncher and 20 m phase rotator has been explored [63]. This produces a

roughly 20 m long bunch train.

Although this shorter system would be much less expensive than the present roughly

200 m long system, an initial evaluation showed that the total number of captured muons

was substantially reduced (by about 50%). (On the other hand, a longer system, capturing

longer bunch trains, might produce more muons, at a small incremental cost.)

Both FS2 and our present scenario use 201.25 MHz rf as the baseline ﬁnal operating

frequency, because of the availability of rf components at that frequency and because it is a

plausible optimum for large-aperture and high-gradient operation. Other baseline frequen-

cies could be considered, e.g., scenarios at 50, 100, 300 or 400 MHz. Lower frequencies (larger

bunches) may be desirable if the accelerator longitudinal motion requires larger phase-space

buckets.

Muons Inc. has an STTR grant to explore the use of hydrogen gas-ﬁlled rf cavities for

muon cooling [64]. This approach simpliﬁes the cooling channel design by integrating the

energy-loss material into the rf system. Moreover, it may be more eﬀective in permitting

high-gradient operation of the cavities. Such cavities could also be used in the cooling

and phase-rotation (and possibly buncher) sections; an exploration with cost-performance

optimization is planned.

The transport and cooling system in the front-end scenario considered here uses high-ﬁeld

solenoids for focusing. A cooling system with similar performance parameters using large-

aperture quadrupoles has also been examined [65], though a cost-performance comparison

has not yet been made.

B. Neutrino Factory Acceleration

The acceleration system takes the beam from the end of the cooling channel and acceler-

ates it to the energy required for the decay ring. Table VIII gives the design parameters of

the acceleration system. Acceptance is deﬁned such that if A⊥ is the transverse acceptance

and β⊥ is the beta function, then the maximum particle displacement (of the particles we

transmit) from the reference orbit is

β⊥A⊥mc/p, where p is the particle’s total momentum,

m is the particle’s rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The acceleration system is able to

accelerate bunch trains of both signs simultaneously.

To reduce costs, the RLA acceleration systems from FS2 will be replaced, as much as

possible, by Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerators.

Based on an earlier version of the cost optimization process described below, it was

decided that two factor-of-two FFAG stages would be used: one from 5 to 10 GeV, the other

from 10 to 20 GeV total energy. Triplet lattices were chosen for their good longitudinal

performance and the extensive study that had been done on them. The parameters that we

adopted are given in Table IX.

The 201.25 MHz cavities were taken to be single-cell superconducting cavities. The energy

gain per rf cavity was chosen based on the gradients already achieved in the cavity studied

at Cornell, namely 10 MV/m at 4.2 K (they have achieved 11 MV/m at 2.5 K) [66]. This

is a very conservative number, as there is every reason to believe that improved sputtering

techniques will allow the cavity to achieve a gradient of 15 MV/m or higher. Energy gain

and stored energy are computed by scaling from the values for the 300 mm aperture FS2

cavities [9],[66].

With the beam intensity given in Table VIII, and both signs of muons, about 16% of the

stored energy will be extracted from the cavities in the 5–10 GeV FFAG, and about 27% will

be extracted in the 10–20 GeV. While this may seem substantial, it is easily handled. To

keep the average voltage to 7.5 MV per cavity, one need only increase the initial voltage to

7.8 MV for the 5–10 GeV FFAG and 8.1 MV for the 10–20 GeV FFAG. The most important

eﬀect is a diﬀerential acceleration between the head and tail of the bunch train, which is

about 1% for both cases. This may be at least partially correctable by a phase oﬀset between

2. Low Energy Acceleration

Based on cost considerations (see Section V B) we have chosen not to use FFAGs below

5 GeV total energy. Therefore, we must provide alternative acceleration up to that point.

As in FS2, we use a linac from the lowest energies to 1.5 GeV, followed by a recirculating

linear accelerator (RLA).

The linac turns out to be strongly constrained by the transverse acceptance.

In FS2,

there were three types of cryomodules, containing one, two, and four cavities, respectively.

With our larger acceptance, the cryomodules from FS2 would require the beam to have a

momentum of at least 420 MeV/c, 672 MeV/c, and 1783 MeV/c, respectively. Note that

the lowest momentum is much higher than the average momentum in the cooling channel,

which is about 220 MeV/c. Thus, we need to make adjustments to the FS2 design to be

able to accelerate this larger beam.

In particular, to increase the acceptance, we must reduce the lengths of the cryomodules.

We ﬁrst construct a very short cryomodule by using a single one-cell cavity instead of the

two-cell cavities in the FS2 cryomodules. Not only does this shorten the cavity itself, it

also eliminates one of the input couplers. Secondly, we remove 50 cm between the solenoid

and the input coupler. We intend to run the cavities with up to 0.1 T on them [67]; this

is acceptable provided the cavities are cooled down before the magnets are powered. The

ﬁeld proﬁle of the solenoids shown in FS2 indicates that the iron shield on the solenoids is

suﬃcient to bring the ﬁeld down to that level even immediately adjacent to the solenoid

shield. Finally, the FS2 cryomodules left 75 cm for the end of the cryostat; we have reduced

this to 50 cm. Together, these changes permit a total length for the ﬁrst module type of

3.25 m. Table X shows the dimensions of this cryostat. The two shortest cryostats from

FS2 have been adjusted to meet these speciﬁcations and, in addition, for the “intermediate”

cryostat the spacing between the cavities was reduced to 75 cm, under the assumptions

that the cavities will be allowed to couple weakly, and that the entire module will be tuned

appropriately to take this into account.

Table XI summarizes parameters for the linac. The phase of the cavities in the linac
will be varied linearly with length from about 65◦ at the beginning of the linac to 0◦ at the

end. As indicated in Table XI, we must inject into the linac at a momentum of 273 MeV/c,

which is still higher than the average momentum in the cooling channel. We deal with this

by designing a matching section from the cooling channel to the linac in which suﬃcient

acceleration will occur to reach the required momentum for the linac. That matching section

will consist of cavities similar to those in the cooling channel, but with thinner windows.

Compared to FS2, we are injecting into the RLA at a lower energy and are accelerating

70

FIG. 48: (Color) Dogbone (top) and racetrack (bottom) layout for the RLA.

over a much smaller energy range. This will make it more diﬃcult to have a large number

of turns in the RLA. To mitigate this, we choose a “dogbone” layout for the RLA [68]. For

a given amount of installed rf, the dogbone layout has twice the energy separation of the

racetrack layout at the spreaders and recombiners, making the switchyard much easier and

allowing more passes through the linac.

One disadvantage of the dogbone layout is that, because of the longer linac and the very

low injection energy, there is a signiﬁcant phase shift of the reference particle with respect to

the cavity phases along the length of the linac in the ﬁrst pass (or the last pass, depending

on which energy the cavities are phased for). To reduce this eﬀect, we inject into the center

of the linac (as shown in Fig. 48).

In the dogbone RLA, we have just over 1 GeV of linac, and we make three and a half

passes through that linac to accelerate from a total energy of 1.5 GeV to 5 GeV. The linac

will use the same cryomodules that were used in the RLA in FS2.

Since the dogbone arc changes its direction of bend twice in each arc, dispersion matching
must be handled carefully. This is done by having a 90◦ phase advance per cell, and removing

the dipoles from two consecutive cells. This will cause the dispersion to switch to the other

sign as desired, as shown in Figure 49.

Figure 50 shows a compact potential layout for all the acceleration systems described

3. FFAG Tracking Results

Initial experience with FFAG lattices having a linear midplane ﬁeld proﬁle has shown

them to have a good dynamic aperture at ﬁxed energies. We are careful to avoid single-

cell linear resonances to prevent beam loss. However, since the tune is not constant (see

Fig. 51), the single-cell tune will pass through many nonlinear resonances. Nonlinearities in

the magnetic ﬁeld due to end eﬀects are capable of driving those nonlinear resonances, and

we must be sure that there is no beam loss and minimal emittance growth because of this.

Furthermore, there is the potential to weakly drive multi-cell linear resonances because the

changing energy makes subsequent cells appear slightly diﬀerent from each other. These

eﬀects can be studied through tracking.

ICOOL [60] is used for tracking for several reasons. It will allow for a fairly arbitrary

end-ﬁeld description, it will attempt to make that description consistent with Maxwell’s

equations, and it will track accurately when the lattice acceptances, beam sizes, and energy

spread are all large.

We begin by constructing a simple model of both a quadrupole and dipole cos θ-type

magnet, without iron, using TOSCA [69]. At the end of the magnet, the ﬁeld does not

immediately drop to zero, but falls gradually, as shown in Fig. 52. The end-ﬁeld falloﬀ in

the dipole and quadrupole generates nonlinear ﬁelds, which ICOOL calculates. In addition,

there are higher-order multipoles generated by breaking the magnet symmetry at the ends

where the coils form closed loops. We use TOSCA to compute the sextupole components

that arise from this eﬀect, as shown in Fig. 53, and include them in our computation.

The TOSCA computation is done without iron, which leads to the overshoot in the ﬁeld

values in Figs. 52–53. Iron in the magnet will likely eliminate that overshoot. Thus, we

approximate the ﬁelds from TOSCA using functions without the overshoot. Fitting roughly

to the TOSCA results, the ﬁelds are approximated by

there appears to be almost none with the body correction included (see Fig. 56).

If the

body correction is only partially included, there is signiﬁcant emittance growth, as seen

in Fig. 56. With these sextupole corrections, we can uniformly accelerate over the entire

5–10 GeV energy range of the lower energy reference FFAG without losing a high-amplitude

particle or having its amplitude grow by a large amount.

When tracking with rf is considered, the longitudinal dynamics behavior is complex [70].

If one begins with an upright ellipse, there is considerable emittance growth if only the

201.25 MHz rf is used (see Fig. 57). Adding a third-harmonic rf considerably reduces the

emittance growth, as shown in Fig. 57. The amount of third-harmonic rf required is sub-

stantial and that, combined with space considerations, makes this alternative unattractive.

Tilting the initial ellipse in phase space will reduce the emittance growth, but a means to

produce that tilt must be developed.

4. FFAG Cost Optimization

The designs for the FFAG lattices are chosen based on a cost optimization. The “costs”

computed by our model are not intended to be used in computing the cost of an actual

machine, but instead are used to ﬁnd the cost of one design relative to another. For a given

lattice type and a given energy range, the magnet lengths, their dipole ﬁelds, and their

quadrupole ﬁelds are allowed to vary to produce the minimum cost for the lattice. Magnet

apertures are determined by ﬁnding a circle that encloses all of the beam ellipses within a

magnet (both at diﬀerent energies and positions) for transverse amplitudes that are equal to

the transverse acceptance. The diﬀerence between the time-of-ﬂight at the minimum energy

and the minimum time-of-ﬂight for all energies (see Fig. 58) is constrained to be a certain

77

value; similarly for the time-of-ﬂight at the maximum energy. That value is chosen to make

the quantity V /ω∆T ∆E take on speciﬁc values. These values depend on the energy of the

lattice, as well as the desired longitudinal acceptance. In the above equation, V is the total

rf voltage in the ring as an energy gain, ω is the angular rf frequency, ∆T is the time-of-ﬂight

diﬀerence described above, and ∆E is the energy range over which the beam is accelerated.

We examined FFAG lattice designs that minimize the relative cost. Some constraints

were assumed in performing the optimization:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

There is at least one 2-m-long drift in each cell to make room for a superconducting rf

cavity. This is substantially longer than the rf cavity, but the extra length is needed

to reduce the ﬁeld from the magnets to below 0.1 T at the cavity surface [67].

All shorter drifts in the cell are 0.5 m long. This is needed to maintain suﬃcient space

between magnets for cryostats and other necessary equipment.

The minimum and maximum energy of each accelerating stage are ﬁxed.

The type of lattice (doublet, triplet, FODO, etc.) is ﬁxed.

The time-of-ﬂight on the energy-dependent closed orbit is the same at the minimum

and maximum energies (see Fig. 58). This minimizes the deviation of the bunch from

the rf crest and therefore, presumably, maximizes the longitudinal acceptance of the

lattice.

The quantity V /(ω∆T ∆E) is a ﬁxed value that depends on the energy range being

considered. This value characterizes the longitudinal acceptance of the system.

The rf gradient is not allowed to exceed a speciﬁed value. Here we take a conservative

value of 10 MV/m. This corresponds to a value that has already been achieved [66].

To get an idea of what is achievable, we developed a set of cost-optimized lattices where a

cavity is placed in every cell, except for 8 cells left open for injection and extraction hardware.

The goal is to minimize the time spent accelerating and therefore minimize the decays. This

drives the design toward a smaller ring but more rf. The results of this optimization are

shown in Table XII. The costs are a signiﬁcant improvement over the FS2 acceleration costs.

Table XII leads to several conclusions:

The doublet lattice is the most cost-eﬀective design. The triplet lattice requires less

voltage, but has a higher magnet cost due to having more magnets per cell.

The cost per GeV of acceleration increases as the energy decreases. The RLA from

FS2 has a cost per GeV around 30 in the units of Table XII, so this in some sense sets

a baseline for determining when an FFAG approach becomes cost eﬀective. Thus, a

2.5–5 GeV FFAG is borderline in its cost eﬀectiveness, while the higher energy FFAGs

The eﬀects of increasing the rf gradient on the costs of the doublet designs in Table XII

are shown in Fig. 59. The choice of the acceptance also has a strong eﬀect on the optimized

cost, as shown in Fig. 60.

5. Design of Combined-Function Superconducting Magnet for FFAGs

An initial design of a superconducting combined-function (dipole–quadrupole) magnet

has been developed [71]. A ﬁrst-cut design of a superconducting combined function, dipole-

quadrupole magnet, is outlined. The design is for one of the QD magnets requiring the

highest ﬁeld and gradient. The parameters of the QD cell are shown in Table XIII, where

L0 is the length of the long drift between the QF magnets, Lq is the length of the short

drift between QF and QD magnets; L is the length of the reference orbit inside the magnet,

r is the radius of curvature of the reference orbit, X0 is the displacement of the center of

the magnet from the reference orbit, R is the radius of the magnet bore, B0 is the vertical

magnetic ﬁeld at the reference orbit, and B1 is the derivative of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld

at the reference orbit.

The magnet design is based on a cosine-theta conﬁguration with two double layers for each

function. The quadrupole coil is located within the dipole coil and both coils are assembled

using key-and-bladder technology. All coils are made with the same Nb–Ti cable capable of

generating the operating dipole ﬁeld and gradient with about the same current of 1800 A (a

single power supply is thus possible with a bit of ﬁne tuning). The maximum central dipole

ﬁeld and gradient at short sample are 4.1 T and 26 T/m, as compared with the requirements

81

of 2.7 T and 15.4 T/m, respectively. At this early design stage, excess margin is left for

safety and perhaps a ﬁeld-rise in the magnet end region. The maximum azimuthal forces

required for magnet pre-stress are of the order of 1 MN/m (assuming maximum safety).

The conductor strand size and cable parameters common to both dipole and quadrupole are

listed in Table XIV.

The initial cross sections of both dipole and quadrupole were designed to give less than

one part in one hundred units of systematic multipole errors at a radius of 70 mm.

It

is straightforward to readjust the design to cancel the end-ﬁeld multipoles as proposed in

Section V B. The combined cross section is shown in Fig. 61 for one quadrant. Figure 62

shows the combined dipole-quadrupole magnetic ﬂux. The calculated mid-plane ﬁeld proﬁle

of the magnet (plotted in Fig. 63) clearly shows the superposed dipole and quadrupole ﬁelds.

A mechanical layout for the magnet has also been developed, as shown in Figs. 64, 65, and

scenario. There was neither the time nor the eﬀort available to carry out a study equivalent

to the baseline scenario prepared by the European Beta Beam Study Group, and we make

no pretense of having done so. Nonetheless, it was felt to be interesting to look brieﬂy at

U.S. options that have the potential for higher energy beams than likely to be available at

CERN in the foreseeable future. In particular, an “intermediate” beam energy of γ = 350,

which corresponds well to the top energy available at the Tevatron, is expected to have

much better resolution than the CERN low-energy option in terms of both CP violation

and sensitivity to the mass hierarchy.

85

The two possible U.S. machines to consider are RHIC at BNL and the Tevatron at

Fermilab. Of these, the Tevatron looks more attractive due to its higher energy reach.

(RHIC has a top energy comparable to the SPS at CERN.) Both BNL and Fermilab are

interested in Superbeams, which complement the Beta Beam in terms of physics reach, and

both Laboratories are pursuing the possibility of obtaining a high-intensity proton driver,

a prerequisite for a Superbeam and helpful, but not critical, for a Beta Beam facility. It

is worth noting, of course, that an intermediate-energy Beta Beam facility would require a

very large decay ring to store a γ = 350 beam. This would add substantially to the cost of

implementing such a facility in the U.S.

1. Estimate of Decay Losses

It is important to know how many ions survive the acceleration process without decaying.

This can be calculated as

where τ is the decay time at rest. If the ramp rate is constant, the integral (which represents

the time passed in the rest frame) becomes

Here, T is the ramp time, γ0 the initial energy, and γ1 ﬁnal energy. In most accelerators,

the energy changes by an order of magnitude (γ1

10γ0), so

−
Substituting this back into Eq. (20) yields

which is just the standard decay formula with the decay time calculated at an “eﬀective”

or average energy equal to 40% of the top energy. In reality, the ramp rate is not constant.

In particular, the start of the ramp is usually slower, leading to a larger total decay than

the above estimate would predict. Nonetheless, Eq. (23) gives a useful ﬁrst approximation.

If a more accurate result were needed, and the ramp function is known, losses could be

calculated directly from Eq. (20).

hand, would be relatively eﬃcient, as it was originally designed as a ﬁxed-target machine

and hence has a reasonably fast ramp. The Tevatron has the additional feature of being,

for now, the world’s highest energy machine. Assuming that the LHC will be busy with

collider physics for the foreseeable future, the Tevatron would thus seem to be the obvious

candidate for generating an “intermediate energy” Beta Beam. There remains one key

question, however—we must assess how the Tevatron’s superconducting magnets would be

aﬀected by the decay products of the Beta Beam. This, in turn, determines how many ions

the machine could accelerate to top energy in a single batch. If there is continued interest

in exploring the possibility of using the Tevatron for an intermediate energy Beta Beam

facility, this issue must be studied.

For the Tevatron, this equation can be used to estimate the number of ions that would

generate 1 W/m from decay losses, which is about 1

the lower energy machines, supplying the Tevatron with this intensity would yield much

lower power deposition, even though their circumferences are smaller. This is because their

duty factor (ramp time divided by Tevatron cycle time) is very small. Anticipated levels are

about 0.05 W/m in the Main Injector, and 0.03 W/m in the Booster, based on the simpliﬁed

88

formula above.

VI. NEUTRINO FACTORY AND BETA BEAM R&D

As should be clear from the design descriptions in Section V, both the muon-based

Neutrino Factory and the Beta Beam facility are demanding projects. Both types of machine

make use of novel components and techniques that are, in some cases, at or beyond the state

of the art. For this reason, it is critical that R&D eﬀorts to study these matters be carried

out. In this Section we describe the main areas of R&D eﬀort under way in support of the

two projects. We give an overview of the R&D program goals and list the speciﬁc questions

we expect ultimately to answer. We also summarize brieﬂy the R&D accomplishments to

date and give an indication of R&D plans for the future.

Since neither of these projects is expected to begin construction in the near future, it

might be asked why it is necessary to pursue a vigorous R&D program now. One answer is

that this R&D is what allows us to determine—with some conﬁdence—both the expected

performance and expected cost of such machines. This information must be available in a

timely way to permit the scientiﬁc community to make informed choices on which project(s)

they wish to request at some future time. Experience has shown that large, complex accel-

erator projects take many years of preparatory R&D in advance of construction. It is only

by supporting this R&D eﬀort now that we can be ready to provide a Neutrino Factory or

Beta Beam facility when the proper time comes.

A. Neutrino Factory R&D

Successful construction of a muon storage ring to provide a copious source of neutri-

nos requires many novel approaches to be developed and demonstrated; a high-luminosity

Muon Collider, which might someday follow, would require an even greater extension of the

present state of accelerator design. Thus, reaching the desired facility performance requires

an extensive R&D program. Each of the major systems has signiﬁcant issues that must be

addressed by R&D activities. Component speciﬁcations need to be veriﬁed. For example,

the cooling channel assumes a normal conducting rf (NCRF) cavity gradient of 15 MV/m at

201.25 MHz, and the acceleration section demands similar performance from superconduct-

89

ing rf (SCRF) cavities at this frequency. In both cases, the requirements are beyond the

performance reached to date for cavities in this frequency range. The ability of the target to

withstand a proton beam power of up to 4 MW must be conﬁrmed. Finally, an ionization

cooling experiment should be undertaken to validate the implementation and performance of

the cooling channel, and to conﬁrm that our simulations of the cooling process are accurate.

1. R&D Program Overview

A Neutrino Factory comprises the following major systems: Proton Driver; Target, (Pion)

Capture, and (Pion-to-Muon) Decay Section; Bunching and Phase Rotation Section; Cooling

Section; Acceleration Section; and Storage Ring. The R&D program we envision is designed

to answer ﬁrst the key questions needed to embark upon a Zeroth-order Design Report

(ZDR). The ZDR will examine the complete systems of a Neutrino Factory, making sure

that nothing is forgotten, and will show how the parts merge into a coherent whole. While

it will not present a fully engineered design with a detailed cost estimate, enough detail will

be presented to ensure that the critical items are technically feasible and that the proposed

facility could be successfully constructed and operated at its design speciﬁcations. By the

end of the full R&D program, it is expected that a formal Conceptual Design Report for a

Neutrino Factory could begin. The CDR would document a complete and fully engineered

design for the facility, including a detailed bottom-up cost estimate for all components.

This document would form the basis for a full technical, cost, and schedule review of the

construction proposal, subsequent to which construction could commence (assuming strong

community support and government approval). The R&D issues for each of the major

systems must be addressed by a mix of theoretical, simulation, modeling, and experimental

studies, as appropriate. A list of the key physics and technology issues for each major

Neutrino Factory system is given below. These issues are being actively pursued as part

of the ongoing worldwide Neutrino Factory R&D program, with participation from Europe,

Japan, and the U.S.

a. Targetry The BNL Targetry experiment, E951, has carried out initial beam

tests [74] of both a solid carbon target and a mercury target at a proton beam intensity

of about 4

1012 ppp. In the case of the solid carbon target, it was found that a carbon-

×

carbon composite having nearly zero coeﬃcient of thermal expansion is largely immune to

beam-induced pressure waves. A carbon target in a helium atmosphere is expected to have

negligible sublimation loss. A program to verify this is under way at ORNL [75]. If radiation

damage is the limiting eﬀect for a carbon target, the predicted lifetime would be about 12

weeks when bombarded with a 1 MW proton beam.

For a mercury jet target, tests with about 2

1012 ppp showed that the jet is not

×

dispersed until long after the beam pulse has passed through the target (see Fig. 67).

Measurements of the velocity of droplets emanating from the jet as it is hit with the proton
beam pulse from the AGS (≈10 m/s for 25 J/g energy deposition) compare favorably with

simulation estimates. High-speed photographs indicate that the beam disruption at the

present intensity does not propagate back upstream toward the jet nozzle. If this remains

true at the higher intensity of 1.6

1013 ppp, it will ease mechanical design issues for the

×

nozzle.

1012 protons. Frames from

×

left to right correspond to time steps of 0, 0.75, 2, 7, and 18 ms, respectively.

b. MUCOOL A primary eﬀort has been to carry out high-power tests of 805-MHz rf

cavities in the Lab G test area at Fermilab. A 5-T test solenoid for the facility, capable of

operating either in solenoid mode (its two independent coils powered in the same polarity)

or gradient mode (with the two coils opposed), was used to study the eﬀects of magnetic

ﬁeld on cavity performance. Most recently, a single-cell 805-MHz pillbox cavity (Fig. 68)

having Be foils to close the beam iris was tested. This cavity permitted an assessment of the

92

behavior of the foils under rf heating and was used to study dark current eﬀects [76]. The

cavity reached 40 MV/m (exceeding its design speciﬁcation) in the absence of a magnetic
ﬁeld, but was limited by breakdown to less than 15 MV/m at high magnetic ﬁeld (≈ 2 T).

Understanding the eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld on cavity performance is crucial, as this is

the environment required for cavities in a muon cooling channel.

FIG. 68: (Color) 805 MHz pillbox rf cavity used for testing. The cavity has removable windows to

permit tests of diﬀerent window materials, and a thin exit port to permit dark current studies.

Development of a prototype LH2 absorber, the material chosen for FS2 and also for MICE

[77] (the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment, see Section VI A 4) is well along. Several

large diameter, thin (125–350 µm) aluminum windows have been successfully fabricated

by machining from solid disks. These have been pressure tested with water and found to

break at a pressure consistent with ﬁnite-element design calculations [78]. Another absorber

material that must be studied is LiH, the material on which the cooling channel used in this

93

report is based. In the new scheme, the LiH serves both as an absorber and an rf window.

This conﬁguration could be tested in the 805-MHz pillbox cavity described above. A new

area, the MUCOOL Test Area (MTA), is nearly completed at FNAL and will be used for

initial testing of the liquid-hydrogen absorbers. It will also have access to both 805-MHz

and 201-MHz high-power rf ampliﬁers for continuing rf tests of the 805-MHz pillbox cavity

and, soon, for testing a prototype 201-MHz cavity. The MTA is located at the end of the

Fermilab proton linac, and is designed to eventually permit beam tests of components and

detectors with 400 MeV protons.

c. Beam Simulations and Theory Subsequent to work on FS2, present eﬀort has fo-

cused on further optimization of Neutrino Factory performance and costs. The more cost

eﬀective front-end design reported in this paper is a result of this work.

d. SCRF Development This work is aimed at development of a high-gradient 201-MHz

SCRF cavity for muon acceleration. (The choice of SCRF for a cooling channel is excluded

because of the surrounding high magnetic ﬁeld; the acceleration system does not suﬀer

this limitation.) A test area of suitable dimensions was constructed at Cornell (Fig. 69)

and used to test a prototype cavity fabricated for the Cornell group by CERN colleagues.

The cavity reached 11 MV/m in initial tests, but exhibited a signiﬁcant “Q slope” as the

gradient increased [66]. To better understand the origins of this phenomenon, eﬀort will

shift to studies on a smaller 500 MHz cavity. Diﬀerent coating and cleaning techniques will

be explored to learn how to mitigate the observed Q slope.

3. R&D plans

a. Targetry For the targetry experiment, design of a pulsed solenoid and its power

supply are under way. A cost-eﬀective design capable of providing up to a 15 T ﬁeld has

been developed (see Fig. 70). Tests of a higher velocity mercury jet (about 20 m/s velocity,

compared with about 2.5 m/s in the jet system initially tested), will be carried out. To com-

plement the experimental program, target simulation eﬀorts are ongoing. These aim at a

suﬃciently detailed understanding of the processes involved to reproduce the observed exper-

imental results both with and without a magnetic ﬁeld. Fully 3D magneto-hydrodynamics

codes are being utilized for this eﬀort.

FIG. 70: (Color) Design of targetry test magnet. The magnet has three nested coils that per-

mit operation at 5, 10, and 15 T. The coils are normal conducting but cooled to liquid-nitrogen

temperature to ease the requirements on the power supply.

b. MUCOOL Further testing work for 805 MHz components will continue in the MTA.

Work will focus on understanding and mitigating dark current and breakdown eﬀects at high

gradient. Many aspects of cavity design, such as cleaning and coating techniques, will be

investigated.

In addition, tests of alternative designs for window or grid electromagnetic

terminations for the rf cavity will be initially explored to identify the best candidates for

the full-sized 201 MHz prototype cavity. Fabrication of the 201 MHz cavity by a group from

95

LBNL, Jlab, and the University of Mississippi is nearly completed. This cavity will also

be tested in the MTA. Thermal tests of a prototype absorber in the MTA are just getting

under way. Fabrication of other cooling channel components required for the initial phase of

testing will be carried out, including a large-bore superconducting solenoid, and diagnostics

that could be used for the experiment. With these components, it will be possible eventually

to assemble and bench test a full prototype cell of a realistic cooling channel. Provision will

be made to test curved Be windows and grids in the 805 MHz cavity, followed by tests on

the 201 MHz prototype. As already noted, the site of the MTA was selected with the goal

of permitting beam tests of the cooling channel components with a high intensity beam of

400 MeV protons. While not the same as using an intense muon beam, such a test would

permit a much better understanding of how the cooling channel would perform operationally,

especially the high-gradient rf cavity and the LH2 or LiH absorber.

c. Beam Simulations and Theory A major simulation eﬀort will continue to focus on

iterating the front-end channel design to optimize it for cost and performance. Further

eﬀort will be given to beam dynamics studies in the FFAG rings and storage ring, including

realistic errors. Work on optimizing the optics design will be done. Assessment of ﬁeld-error

eﬀects on the beam transport will be made to deﬁne acceptance criteria for the magnets.

This will require use of sophisticated tracking codes, such as COSY [79], that permit rigorous

treatment of ﬁeld errors and fringe-ﬁeld eﬀects. In many ways, the storage ring is one of the

most straightforward portions of a Neutrino Factory complex. However, beam dynamics is

an issue here as the muon beam must circulate for many hundreds of turns. Use of a tracking

code such as COSY is required to assess fringe ﬁeld and large aperture eﬀects. As with the

FFAG rings, the relatively large emittance and large energy spread enhance the sensitivity

to magnetic ﬁeld and magnet placement errors. Suitable magnet designs are needed, with

the main technical issue being the relatively high radiation environment. Another lattice

issue that must be studied is polarization measurement. In the initial implementation of a

Neutrino Factory it is expected that polarization will not be considered, but its residual value

may nonetheless be important in analyzing the experiment. Simulation eﬀorts in support

of MICE will continue. We also plan to participate in a so-called “World Design Study”

of an optimized Neutrino Factory. This study, an international version of the two previous

U.S. Feasibility Studies, will likely be hosted in the UK by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory

(RAL), the site for the MICE experiment (see Section VI A 4). It will be organized jointly

96

by representatives from Europe, Japan, and the U.S.

d. SCRF Development A prototype 500 MHz SCRF cavity will be used to study the

Q slope phenomenon, with the goal of developing coating and cleaning techniques that

reduce or eliminate it. Detuning issues at 201 MHz associated with the very large cavity

dimensions and the pulsed rf system will be evaluated. Tests of the 201 MHz SCRF cavity

will include operation in the vicinity of a shielded solenoid magnet, to demonstrate our

ability to adequately reduce nearby magnetic ﬁelds in a realistic lattice conﬁguration. If

funds permit, design of a prototype high-power rf source will be explored, in collaboration

with industry. This source—presently envisioned to be a multibeam klystron—must be

developed for operation at two diﬀerent duty factors, because the cooling channel requires

a duty factor of about 0.002 whereas the acceleration chain requires 0.045. Magnet designs

suitable for the FFAG rings and the muon storage ring will be examined further. Both

conventional and superconducting designs will be compared where both are possible. With

SC magnets, radiation heating becomes an issue and must be assessed and dealt with.

4. Cooling Demonstration Experiment

Clearly, one of the most important R&D tasks that is needed to validate the design of a

Neutrino Factory is to measure the cooling eﬀects of the hardware we propose. Participation

in the international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will accomplish this,

and is therefore expected eventually to grow into a primary activity. Unquestionably, the

experience gained from this experiment will be invaluable for the design of an actual cooling

channel.

At the NUFACT’01 Workshop in Japan, a volunteer organization was created to organize

a cooling demonstration experiment that might begin as soon as 2004. Membership in this

group includes representatives from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. The experimental collab-

oration now numbers some 140 members from the three geographical regions. The MICE

Collaboration has received scientiﬁc approval for the experiment from RAL management,

and is now in the process of seeking funding. The experiment will involve measuring, on

a particle-by-particle basis, the emittance reduction produced by a single cell of the FS2

cooling channel. A schematic of the layout is shown in Fig. 71. The cooling channel cell is

preceded and followed by nearly identical detector modules that accomplish particle iden-

97

tiﬁcation and emittance measurement. Provision for testing a series of absorber materials,

including both LH2 and solid absorbers, has been made. A preliminary safety review of

the liquid-hydrogen system has been successfully passed, and permission to begin detailed

engineering has been granted.

FIG. 71: (Color) Schematic of the MICE layout.

B. Beta Beam R&D

Constructing a Beta Beam facility requires a number of new techniques to be developed.

In the CERN-based scenario, where the facility incorporates a number of existing machines,

a signiﬁcant technical challenge is to ensure that the proposed parameters for the Beta

Beam case are compatible with the capabilities of the present accelerators. If not, required

modiﬁcations must be identiﬁed and demonstrated. An additional constraint in the CERN

scenario—or a corresponding U.S. scenario based on existing machines—is that the modiﬁ-

cations to accommodate Beta Beams must maintain compatibility with existing programs.

There are several signiﬁcant challenges in providing Beta Beams of the required intensity,

and R&D is required to validate the concepts proposed to deal with them. These issues

98

include:

•

Target: To provide the required ion intensities, the target must be able to handle

the driver beam intensity for a reasonable lifetime. While the production of 6He looks

fairly straightforward, the production of 18Ne is less so. The baseline production

method for 18Ne relies on direct bombardment of the target material with the proton

beam. Determining what intensity is acceptable to maintain a reasonable target life-

time must be done. The alternative production technique suggested for 18Ne, namely

the 16O(3He,n) reaction, clearly requires a diﬀerent incoming beam, which might re-

quire an additional driver accelerator. In the scenario where the outputs from three

targets are combined, techniques for splitting the driver beam into multiple paths and

combining the target outputs into a single ion source need to be worked out and tested.

Since the ion source must necessarily be remote from the highly active target area,

good transport eﬃciency for the nuclides of interest must be demonstrated.

•

•

Ion Source: With an ISOL-type production system, the ions are produced continu-

ously. To prepare the beam for acceleration, it must then be bunched considerably, to

below 20 µs. It is proposed to get the required intensity and bunch structure by using

a new ion source concept, with state-of-the-art speciﬁcations. The source is an ECR

source operating at high frequency (60 GHz) with a high magnetic ﬁeld (2–3 T) and
high plasma density (ne ∼ 1014cm−3). Such a source has never been built, though a

development eﬀort is now under way at Grenoble [30]. It will be necessary to study

the inﬂuence of the carrier gas on the ionization eﬃciency. Also, the ability to produce

fully stripped beams of 18Ne must be demonstrated. Typically ECR sources produce

high charge states, but not so high as Ne10+. Even with an enhanced ion source of

the type proposed, the expected [80] antineutrino intensity is 2.1

1018 per “Snow-

mass year” (1

107 s), and that for neutrinos (assuming that the outputs from three

×

×

production targets are combined) is 3.5

1017.

×

Decay Losses: The losses in the low-energy portion of the accelerator chain are high

because the beam is intense and its relativistic γ is low. In the CERN scenario, the

PS is somewhat vulnerable as it has already accumulated a high radiation dose over

its operational lifetime and its cycle time is not rapid. For 6He, the PS losses are

estimated [81] to be about 1.2 W/m while those in the storage ring are 28 W/m.

99

In the latter case, specially designed superconducting magnets with no coils in the

midplane are required to avoid quenches. (A variant of this approach is used for the

muon storage ring of a Neutrino Factory, for the same reason.) Building prototype

magnets and measuring their ﬁeld quality and quench resistance should be undertaken

to validate the proposed approach.

Storage Ring Issues: Since the storage ring must be frequently topped oﬀ, injection

•

requires the use of bunch-merging techniques. A concept has been worked out for this,

and an initial test was encouraging. Since many of the problems with rf manipulation

techniques are intensity dependent, it will probably still be necessary to validate the

proposed scheme under fully realistic conditions. The recent proposal to run both

6He and 18Ne beams simultaneously in the decay ring is another non-trivial complica-
tion. At the same rigidity, the heavier beam has a relativistic γ that is 5

3 that of the
lighter beam, so the orbits must be adjusted to provide the same revolution period.

This may well have some beam dynamics implications for the oﬀ-center beam, given

that the proposed magnets may not have ideal ﬁelds far oﬀ axis.

It will certainly

complicate beam manipulations for the two beams, especially the injection and bunch

merging. Another issue that needs to be evaluated in detail is the inﬂuence of the

beam parameters (orbits, emittance, beta functions) on the neutrino spectrum at the

detector.

VII. SUMMARY

Two new types of facility have been proposed that could have a tremendous impact on

future neutrino experiments—the Neutrino Factory and the Beta Beam facility. In contrast

to conventional muon-neutrino beams, Neutrino Factory and Beta Beam facilities would

provide a source of electron-neutrinos (νe) and -antineutrinos (¯νe), with very low systematic

uncertainties on the associated beam ﬂuxes and spectra. The experimental signature for
νe →
Factories and Beta Beams would enable very sensitive oscillation measurements to be made.

νµ transitions is extremely clean, with very low background rates. Hence, Neutrino

This is particularly true at a Neutrino Factory which not only provides very intense beams

at high energy, but also provides muon-neutrinos (νµ) and -antineutrinos (¯νµ) in addition

to electron-neutrinos (νe) and -antineutrinos (¯νe). This would facilitate a large variety of

100

complementary oscillation measurements in a single detector, and dramatically improve our

ability to test the three-ﬂavor mixing framework, measure CP violation in the lepton sector

(and perhaps determine the neutrino mass hierarchy), and, if necessary, probe extremely

small values of the mixing angle θ13.

At this time, we do not know the value of θ13. If sin2 2θ13 < 0.01, much of the basic neu-

trino oscillation physics program will be beyond the reach of conventional neutrino beams.

In this case Neutrino Factories and Beta Beams oﬀer the only known way to pursue the

desired physics program.

The sensitivity that could be achieved at a Beta Beam facility presently looks very promis-

ing, but is still being explored.

In particular, the optimum Beta Beam energy is under

discussion. Low energy Beta Beam measurements would complement Superbeam measure-

ments, but would achieve a θ13 sensitivity that does not appear to be competitive with that

of a Neutrino Factory. Higher energy Beta Beams may approach the sensitivity possible

with a Neutrino Factory, although systematics issues need further study. Thus, while a Beta

Beam facility may have a signiﬁcant role to play in the future global neutrino program,

more work must be done on its design, development, cost estimate, and physics sensitivity

to validate its potential. We note that, due to very limited resources, there has been no

signiﬁcant activity in the U.S. on Beta Beams. Progress on Beta Beam development being

made in Europe should be followed, especially if the higher energy solution continues to look

favorable.

An impressive Neutrino Factory R&D eﬀort has been ongoing in the U.S. and elsewhere

over the last few years, and signiﬁcant progress has been made towards optimizing the design,

developing and testing the required accelerator components, and signiﬁcantly reducing the

cost, even during the current Study.

(Although a full engineering study is required, we

have preliminary indications that the unloaded cost of a Neutrino Factory facility based

on an existing Superbeam proton driver and target station can be reduced substantially

compared with previous estimates.) Neutrino Factory R&D has reached a critical stage in

which support is required for two key international experiments (MICE and Targetry) and

a third-generation international design study.

If this support is forthcoming, a Neutrino

Factory could be added to the Neutrino Physics roadmap in about a decade.

Given the present uncertainty about the size of θ13, it is critical to support an ongoing and

increased U.S. investment in Neutrino Factory accelerator R&D to maintain this technical

101

option. A Neutrino Factory cannot be built without continued and increased support for its

development. We note that the 2001 HEPAP Report advocated an annual U.S. investment

of $8M on Neutrino Factory R&D. The present support is much less than this. Since R&D

on the design of frontier accelerator facilities takes many years, support must be provided

now to have an impact in about a decade.

102

VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS

Accelerator R&D is an essential part of the ongoing global neutrino program. Limited

beam intensity is already constraining the neutrino physics program, and will continue to

do so in the future. More intense and new types of neutrino beams would have a big impact

on the future neutrino program. A Neutrino Factory would require a Superbeam-type MW-

scale proton source. We thus encourage the rapid development of a Superbeam-type proton

source.

•

The Neutrino Factory and Beta Beam Working Group’s speciﬁc recommendations are:

We recommend that the ongoing Neutrino Factory R&D in the U.S. be

given continued encouragement and ﬁnancial support. We note that the

HEPAP Report of 2001 recommended an annual support level of $8M for Neutrino

Factory R&D, and this level was considered minimal to keep the R&D eﬀort viable.

In addition, and consistent with the above recommendation,

1. We recommend that the U.S. funding agencies ﬁnd a way to support

the international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE), in

collaboration with European and Japanese partners. We note that MICE

now has scientiﬁc approval at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK,

and will require signiﬁcant U.S. participation. This has been identiﬁed as an

important experiment for the global Neutrino Factory R&D program. A timely

indication of U.S. support for MICE is needed to move the experiment forward.

2. We recommend that support be found to ensure that the international

Targetry R&D experiment proceeds as planned. We note that this R&D

activity is crucial for the short-, medium-, and long-term neutrino programs, and

for other physics requiring high-intensity beams.

3. We recommend that a World Design Study, aimed at solidly estab-

lishing the cost of a cost-eﬀective Neutrino Factory, be supported at

the same level as Studies I and II. We note that the studies done here

suggest that the cost of a Neutrino Factory would be signiﬁcantly less than es-

timated for Studies I and II. This makes a Neutrino Factory a very attractive

ingredient in the global neutrino roadmap.

We recommend that progress on Beta Beam development be monitored,

and that our U.S. colleagues cooperate fully with their EU counterparts

in assessing how U.S. facilities might play a role in such a program. We

note that there is no signiﬁcant U.S. R&D eﬀort on Beta Beams due to our limited

R&D resources. Insofar as an intermediate energy solution is desirable, however, the

Beta Beam idea is potentially of interest to the U.S. physics community.

IX. APPENDIX A

A. Cost Reduction

Here we present the cost scaling we have done with respect to FS2 cost numbers [9].

Since there was neither time nor engineering eﬀort available to perform a bottom-up cost

estimate for the new systems we have developed during the present Study, we have based

our costs on the FS2 numbers and scaled them appropriately to derive the estimated savings

from our new technical approaches. For that reason, we quote the results as a percentage of

the original FS2 estimates, to avoid giving the impression that this is anything more than a

“physicist’s estimate” at this point in time.

The method we employed was as follows:

Starting from the FS2 Work Breakdown Structure system costs, we derive useful ele-

ment costs per unit length, per integral rf voltage, or per unit acceleration.

We then applied these scaling rules to the new parameters derived from this Study (see

Section V) to obtain a ﬁrst approximation to the revised cost. Our results are reported

as costs relative to FS2. We have ignored minor corrections, such as escalating the

costs to FY2004 dollars, as these are small compared with the precision of our estimate.

Because it is expected that a future Neutrino Factory would be built as an “upgrade”

or follow-on to a Superbeam facility, we think it likely that the Proton Driver—and

104

quite possibly the Target facility as well—will already exist at the time the Neutrino

Factory construction commences. For this reason, our costs are given with and without

including the Proton Driver or Target Station.

Based on the costing approach we used, we expect that the unloaded hardware cost of

the updated Neutrino Factory design will be reduced by about one-third compared with the

original FS2 cost estimate of $1.8B (see Table XVIII).

1. Proton Driver

The cost basis for FS2 was an upgrade of the AGS to 1 MW beam power. The cost used

here is taken without change from FS2. As noted earlier, we anticipate that this component

would already be in place to support a prior Superbeam experiment. In that case, it would

not be part of the cost to construct a Neutrino Factory. Since the Proton Driver tends to

be the most site-speciﬁc component of a Neutrino Factory, we expect the remaining costs

to be largely site independent.

2. Target and Capture

The updated Target and Capture system is almost the same as that in FS2, but diﬀers

in the details. In particular, the region over which the ﬁeld tapers down is shorter by 5.5 m

because it tapers only to 1.75 T rather than the 1.25 T used in FS2. The cost will thus

be somewhat less. We estimated this savings by subtracting the cost of 5.5 m of a 1.25 T

transport channel, whose cost per meter was taken from the drift region in FS2. This is

a conservative estimate, because the section eliminated had ﬁelds varying from 1.75 T to

1.25 T, whereas the savings are estimated assuming lower ﬁeld transport at 1.25 T.

105

3. Drift Region

The ﬁrst 18 m of drift is more expensive than later beam transport sections because of

the required radiation shielding. We therefore treat this ﬁrst 18 m of drift separately from

the subsequent transport. To evaluate the cost, we took the FS2 costs for the ﬁrst 18 m,

and then made a correction due to the higher solenoid ﬁeld in the new channel compared

with FS2 (1.75 T vs. 1.25 T). Speciﬁcally, the correction involved increasing the magnet,

power supply, and cryogenic costs using the second scaling formula from Green et al. [82],

Cost (in $M)

(BR2L)0.577.

∝

(29)

The subsequent 82 m drift requires less shielding and will thus be less expensive. In FS2,

there was no equivalent simple drift from which to scale this cost. Therefore, we estimated

the costs based on the magnets, power supplies, and cryogenics included in the induction

linac region of FS2. As these costs were for 1.25 T magnets, we corrected for the higher

1.75 T ﬁeld using Eq. 29. This estimate is quite conservative, because the transport magnets

in the induction linacs of FS2, which were introduced inside the induction linac cores, had

to meet more diﬃcult requirements, and had more complicated cryostats.

4. Buncher and Phase Rotation

As discussed in Section V, the Buncher and Phase Rotation section adopted here is quite

diﬀerent from the induction-linac-based system used in FS2. The focusing now consists of an

essentially continuous solenoid at 1.75 T, as in the drift, but with a radius (65 cm) suﬃcient

for it to be located outside of the rf cavities. To estimate the cost of this solenoid, we again

use the FS2 induction linac transport magnets, scaled to the appropriate parameters via

Eq. 29 (now correcting for both the higher ﬁeld and the larger radius). This estimate is

again conservative, because it is scaled from the more diﬃcult transport solenoids inside the

induction linacs of FS2.

As described in Section V, in place of induction linacs, the present study uses a sequence

of rf cavities at frequencies in the range of 200–300 MHz. The cost of these cavities, and

their required rf power supplies, are scaled from the FS2 costs of cooling channel rf cavities.

These costs are scaled for the diﬀerent average accelerating gradients as follows: cavity cost

per GeV

1
V , power supply cost per GeV proportional to V .

∝

106

5.

Cooling Section

The rf system for the cooling channel used in the present study is essentially identical

to that in FS2, so the costs per GeV are taken to be the same. The focusing lattice,

however, is quite diﬀerent—a simple alternating solenoid array (FOFO) instead of the more

complicated, and tapered, super-FOFO lattices in FS2. We estimate the new magnet system

cost by scaling from Lattice-1 of the FS2 cooling channel, using the ﬁrst scaling formula in

Ref. [82], which depends on the total stored energy U (cost

U 0.662). The stored energy

∝

per unit length in the present study and the earlier FS2 lattice are in the ratio of 189:382,
so the new cost per meter is taken to scale as ( 189
382 )0.662. The cryogenic system cost is also
scaled with the magnet costs, but based on the cryogenic costs of the FS2 phase rotation

section. (We do not use cryogenic costs from the FS2 cooling channel, as these are heavily

biased by the cooling requirements of the LH2 absorbers.)

This is a quite conservative estimate, because the new lattice not only has a smaller stored

energy, it is simpler. In particular, the channel adopted in this study uses only a single type

of solenoid and, when powered, there are no inter-coil forces. In contrast, the FS2 lattice

employed two types of solenoid magnets and had very large inter-coil forces between the

“focus” coil pair.

No cost was included for the LiH absorbers in the present estimate, as we do not yet have

a good basis for one. Our expectation is that these rf windows will cost no more than the

Be windows they replace, but this is presently unveriﬁed.

6. Match to Pre-Accelerator

A section is required to match the (momentum-dependent) beta function in the cooling

channel to that in the pre-accelerator linac. In the FS2 case, beta vs. momentum in the

cooling lattice was highly non-linear, with low betas at the upper and lower momentum

limits and a maximum beta in the center, whereas the beta functions in the pre-accelerator

were approximately linear in momentum. As failure to match the two would have resulted

in signiﬁcant emittance growth and particle loss, we included a matching section using 18 m

of a modiﬁed 1.65 m cell (Lattice-2) cooling lattice. The optics of the ﬁrst two-thirds of

the matching section was adjusted to adiabatically change the beta vs. momentum shape,

107

and raise the central beta from 20 cm to about 60 cm. The ﬁnal one-third of the matching

section increased the beta function to about 3 m to match the pre-accelerator optics.

In the present case, the match will be simpler and less expensive because a) the beta

functions both before and after the match have similar linear momentum dependence, b)

the match requires a smaller change in beta function than was needed in FS2, and c) the

lattice on which it will be based has a considerably lower stored energy per unit length

(189/1039). As a new matching section has not yet been designed, we correct the cost only

due to c) by scaling the cost by this factor using the ﬁrst formula in Ref. [82]. This too is a

conservative approach, as it is expected that the length of the new matching section will be

much less than the original one.

7. Pre-Acceleration

For the rf system and cryogenics, the Pre-Acceleration cost is scaled from that in FS2 by

the energy gain from the rf cavities. For magnets and vacuum, we scaled with length.

8. RLA

The present study makes use of a dogbone RLA to accelerate from 1.5–5 GeV. The RLA

cost is scaled from the 2.5–20 GeV RLA in FS2. The number of passes is 3.5, compared

with 4 for FS2. Although we favor a dogbone geometry for ease of the switchyard design,

as opposed to the FS2 racetrack layout, costs per unit length, or per unit energy gain, are

expected to be very similar. We took these to be the same. Similarly, the arcs are assumed

to have the same average bending ﬁeld as the ﬁnal FS2 arc, so the cost per unit length is

taken to be the same. The lengths of the arcs were chosen to provide an absolute bend angle
of 420◦ at each end of the linac. Magnet costs for the special and transport magnets were

scaled with the ﬁnal RLA energies.

9. FFAG

FFAG costs for all technical and conventional systems are taken from a cost algorithm

based on similar scaling arguments to those used above for the other beam line sections.

108

The algorithm we used, when applied to the FS2 RLA as a “reality check”, gave a higher

cost than determined in FS2. It thus appears to be conservative in its cost estimation.

Injection and extraction kickers are assumed to be driven by typical induction-linac pulsed

power sources, and will contain similar amounts of magnetic materials. Our estimated costs

were based on a length of the FS2 induction linac having the same pulsed energy as required

Transfer line lengths are taken from Ref. [83] and include lines for both µ+ and µ−. The

cost per meter of these transport lines is based on RLA arcs (magnets, power supplies, and

for the kickers.

vacuum) from FS2.

10. Storage Ring

Storage ring costs are taken, without modiﬁcation, from FS2. However, in that case,

there was a site-dependent constraint that no part of the downward tilted ring should fall

below the nearby water table. This constraint forced the design to assume construction of

the ring in an artiﬁcial hill, and also to require unusually high (hence not cost optimized)

bending ﬁelds to keep the ring small. The cost at another site, without this constraint,

would likely be less.

11. Overall Relative Costs

The result of applying the scaling rules outlined in this Appendix is summarized in

Table XIX. As can be seen, the present design exercise, completed as part of the APS

Neutrino Physics Study, has maintained the original performance of the Neutrino Factory

designed in FS2 for either muon sign, yielding either neutrinos or antineutrinos. Unlike FS2,
however, the present design will supply both µ+ and µ− simultaneously (interleaved in the

bunch train), thus eﬀectively doubling the performance compared with FS2. This has been

accomplished while reducing the cost of the facility by about 1/3.

While the present scaling estimate is not a replacement for a detailed engineering cost

estimate, we are conﬁdent that the majority of the cost reductions identiﬁed here will survive

a more rigorous treatment.

We note that the design progress made in this Study is a direct result of the funding made

109

available to the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration for Neutrino Factory

accelerator R&D. Optimizing and reﬁning the design of state-of-the-art facilities such as

this, as well as verifying that component speciﬁcations can be met and that component

costs are realistic, is critical to allowing the high-energy physics community to make sound

12. Possible Further Savings

Earlier studies indicated small performance loss if the capture solenoid is reduced from

20 to 17–18 T. If we ﬁnd that this is still the case, the ﬁeld speciﬁed would be reduced

and some savings made.

Reducing the cooling channel length to 50 m would lower the cost of the channel while

reducing the performance by only about 15%. With better optimization, some or all

of this loss may be recoverable.

should reduce the cost somewhat.

The expected shorter match from the Cooling Section to the Pre-Acceleration Section

Increasing the number of turns in the RLA, and lowering its injection energy, should

reduce the costs of the early acceleration portion of the Neutrino Factory.

A lower ﬁeld, larger storage ring should result in some savings.

The above list suggests that, while the collaboration’s eﬀorts have been eﬀective in reduc-

ing the costs of the major items (see Table XIX), options still exist to reduce the costs of the

110

lesser items as well. Thus, we are hopeful that some further cost reductions are achievable.

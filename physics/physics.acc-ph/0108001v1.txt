ABSTRACT

Two 2200 m radius hybrid rings of ﬁxed superconducting
magnets and iron magnets ramping at 200 Hz and 330 Hz are
used to accelerate muons. Muons are given 25 GeV of RF en-
ergy per orbit. Acceleration is from 250 GeV/c to 2400 GeV/c
and requires a total of 86 orbits in both rings; 82% of the muons
survive. The total power consumption of the iron dipoles is
4 megawatts. Stranded copper conductors and thin Metglas
laminations are used to reduce power losses.

of magnet bores because the sagitta changes throughout a cy-
cle. Table II shows sagitta for various magnets and momenta.
As momentum increases, the sagitta in the 8 Tesla magnets de-
creases towards zero and the sagitta in the 2 Tesla magnets goes
somewhat past zero. Note that for a given bore size the magnets
can be longer given a higher injection momentum.

INTRODUCTION

Table II: Sagitta as a function of momentum, magnetic ﬁeld, and
magnet length.

For a µ+µ− collider, muons must be rapidly accelerated to
high energies while minimizing the kilometers of radio fre-
quency (RF) cavities and magnet bores. Cost must be moderate.
Some muons may be lost to decay but not too many.

Consider a ring of ﬁxed superconducting magnets alternating
with iron magnets rapidly cycling between full negative and full
positive ﬁeld [1]. Table I shows the range of average dipole
magnetic ﬁeld for various mixes of the two types of magnets.
One might use more than one ring in succession. Now proceed
with a few back–of–the–envelope calculations.

II. MAGNET SAGITTAS

The sagitta of a muon in a magnet increases linearly with in-
creasing magnetic ﬁeld, B. It decreases linearly with increasing
momentum, p. And it increases as the square of the length of
a magnet, ℓ. The size of the sagitta directly affects the size

III. POWER CONSUMPTION

Consider the feasibility of an iron dominated design for a
magnet which cycles from a full -2 Tesla to a full +2 Tesla [2].
First calculate the energy, W , stored in a 2 Tesla ﬁeld in a vol-
ume 6 m long, .03 m high, and .08 m wide. The permeability
constant, µ0, is 4π × 10−7.

W =

Next given 6 turns, an LC circuit capacitor, and a 250 Hz
frequency; estimate current, voltage, inductance, and capaci-
tance. The height, h, of the aperature is .03 m. The top and
bottom coils may be connected as two separate circuits to halve
the switching voltage.

Now calculate the resistive energy loss, which over time is
equal to one-half the loss at the maximum current of 8000
Amps. The one-half comes from the integral of cosine squared.
Table III gives the resistivities of copper and other metals. A
six-turn copper conductor 3 cm thick, 10 cm high, and 7800 cm
long has a power dissipation of 15 kilowatts.

More exotic metals with higher resistivities are also available as
shown in Table III. Choose 2 tubes per 3 cm × 10 cm stranded
copper conductor for a total length of 78 × 2 = 156 m. Take
a 12 mm OD and a 10 mm ID. Subtract the losses in the inner
missing round conductor. The combined eddy current loss in
the copper plus the stainless steel is 4200 watts (3000 + 2400 -
1200).

Eddy currents must be reduced in the iron not only because
of the increase in power consumption and cooling, but also
because they introduce multipole moments which destabilize
beams. If the laminations are longitudinal, it is hard to force
the magnetic ﬁeld to be parallel to the laminations near the
gap. This leads to additional eddy current gap losses [13]. So
consider a magnet with transverse laminations as sketched in
Fig. 1 and calculate the eddy current losses. The yoke is ei-
ther 0.28 mm thick 3% grain oriented silicon steel [14–17] or
0.025 mm thick Metglas 2605SA1 [8, 9]. The pole tips are
0.1 mm thick Supermendur [6] to increase the ﬁeld in the gap
[18].

Calculate the dissipation due to eddy currents in this conduc-
tor, which will consist of transposed strands to reduce this loss
[10–12]. To get an idea, take the maximum B-ﬁeld during a
cycle to be that generated by a 0.05m radius conductor carry-
ing 24000 amps. This ignores fringe ﬁelds from the gap which
will make the real answer higher. The eddy current loss in a
rectangular conductor made of square wires 1/2 mm wide with
a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld is as follows. The width of the
wire is w.

In summary, a 250 Hz dipole magnet close to 2 Tesla looks
possible as long as the ﬁeld volume is limited and one is willing
to deal with stranded copper and thin, low hysteresis lamina-
tions. Total losses can be held to twice the I2R loss in the copper
alone, using Metglas.

IV. MUON ACCELERATION AND SURVIVAL

Now with a rough design for a fast ramping magnet in hand,
work out the details of ring radii, RF requirements, and the frac-
tion of muons that survive decay. The fraction of the circumfer-
ence packed with dipoles is set at PF = 70%. As an example,
consider two rings in a 2200 m radius tunnel with an injection
momentum of 250 GeV/c. The ﬁrst has 25% 8T magnets and
75% ±2T magnets and ramps from 0.5T to 3.5T. The second
has 55% 8T magnets and 45% ±2T magnets and ramps from
3.5T to 5.3T.

Figure 1: A two dimensional picture of an H frame magnet
lamination with grain oriented 3% Si–Fe steel. The arrows show
both the magnetic ﬁeld direction and the grain direction of the
steel. Multiple pieces are used to exploit the high permeabil-
ity and low hysteresis in the grain direction [19]. If Metglas
2605SA1 is used for the yoke, multiple pieces are not needed,
except for the poles. The pole tips are an iron–cobalt alloy for
ﬂux concentration exceeding 2 Tesla.

difﬁcult to calculate theoretically must be included. Thus I now
use functions ﬁtted to experimental measurements of 0.28 mm
thick 3% grain oriented silicon steel [20], 0.025 mm thick Met-
glas 2605SA1 [8], and 0.1 mm thick Supermendur [20].

Only 1/6 of the 18% loss occurs in the second ring, so it is
not crucial to run it as fast as 330 Hz; but the RF does allow this
speed.

V. SUMMARY

The 250 → 1600 GeV/c ring has 1200 6 m long dipole mag-
nets ramping at 200 Hz. The 1600 → 2400 GeV/c ring has 725
6 m long dipole magnets ramping at 330 Hz. The weighted av-
erage rate is 250 Hz. If running continuously, the 1925 magnets
would consume a weighted average of 29 kilowatts each for a
total of 56 megawatts. But given a 15 Hz refresh rate for the
ﬁnal muon storage ring [21], the average duty cycle for the 250
→ 2400 GeV/c acceleration rings is 6%. So the power falls to 4
megawatts, which is small.

Finally note that one can do a bit better than 82% on the muon
survival during ﬁnal acceleration if the ﬁrst ring is smaller, say
1000 meters, rather than 2200 meters. Given that RF is expen-
sive, a single line of cavities could still be used for all rings.

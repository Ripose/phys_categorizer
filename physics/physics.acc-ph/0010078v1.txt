Abstract
We present a new conceptual and optical design for the
Next Linear Collider post-linac collimation system. En-
ergy collimation and passive protection against off-energy
beams are achieved in a system with large horizontal dis-
persion and vertical betatron functions. Betatron collima-
tion is performed in a relatively low-beta (FODO-like) lat-
tice in which only thin spoilers intercept particles near the
beam core, while thick absorbers maintain a large stay-
clear from the beam. Two possible schemes for the spoil-
ers are considered: one in which the spoilers are capable of
tolerating a certain number of damaging interceptions per
collider run (”consumable” spoilers), and one in which the
spoilers are potentially damaged on every machine pulse
and are self-repairing (”renewable” spoilers). The colli-
mation efﬁciency of the system is evaluated, considering
both halo particles which are rescattered into the beam and
muon secondaries which are passed to the interaction re-
gion. We conclude that the new design is a promising can-
didate for the NLC post-linac system.

INTRODUCTION

The experience of the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) in-
dicates that collimation of the beam halo at the end of the
main linacs of the Next Linear Collider (NLC) will be a ne-
cessity. The principal requirements on the NLC post-linac
collimation system are as follows:

• The system should stop particles which would gen-
erate unacceptable backgrounds in the detector from
entering the ﬁnal focus

• The collimation efﬁciency should be sufﬁciently high
that the number of halo particles which are transmitted
to the ﬁnal focus is comparable to the number gener-
ated by beam-gas and thermal-photon scattering from
the collimation region and the ﬁnal focus

• The number of muon secondaries from the collimation
system which reach the detector must be minimized
• The optical and wakeﬁeld dilutions of the beam emit-

tances due to the collimation system must be small

• The system must protect the ﬁnal focus and the detec-
tor from beams which have large energy or betatron
excursions without being destroyed in the process.

The 1996 NLC design included a post-linac collima-
tion system shown in Figure 1 [1]. The system design

was driven primarily by the machine protection require-
ment that a single bunch train (80 kJ at 500 GeV per beam)
at nominal emittances (γǫx,y = (4 × 0.06) mm.mrad)
should not be able to damage the collimators. This re-
quired a scheme of optically-thin spoilers and thick ab-
sorbers in each plane, large betatron functions, and strong
optics, which in turn introduced difﬁculties due to nonlin-
earities and wakeﬁelds.

The difﬁculties envisioned in the operation of the colli-
mation system led to reconsideration of the design assump-
tions and a new conceptual design.

2 DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS

The design of the post-linac collimation system is most
strongly governed by the expected properties of large ex-
cursions which can impact the collimators. Previously
it had been assumed that neither energy nor betatron ex-
cursions could be trapped actively in the NLC due to its
low repetition rate (120 linac pulses per second). A re-
examination of the SLC operational history, as well as that
of other accelerators, indicated that failures which could
cause a fast (inter-pulse) betatron oscillation of the required
magnitude were either rare or could be eliminated by de-
sign, while pulse-to-pulse energy variations of the required
magnitude cannot be ruled out for a linac.

The expected charge of the beam halo was originally
1010 particles per linac pulse (1% of the beam), based
on early SLC experience. Later SLC experience showed
that the halo could be reduced substantially through care-
ful tuning of the injection (damping ring and compressor)
systems. In the present NLC design a collimation system
downstream of the damping ring and ﬁrst bunch compres-

sor is expected to dramatically reduce the halo intensity at
the end of the main linac. The present estimate of the halo
is 107 particles per pulse; we have chosen to design for
a safety factor of 100 over this estimate. This reduction
eliminates the requirements for water cooling in the spoiler
elements and eases the tolerances on muon generation.

3.1 Energy Collimation

The energy collimation section achieves passive protection
against off-energy pulses through a 0.5 radiation length
(R.L.) spoiler and a 20 R.L. absorber separated by approx-
imately 30 meters. The ﬁrst few R.L. of the absorber are
titanium, for which the RMS beam size σr ≡ √σxσy
must be larger than 560 µm to ensure survival [2]. Beams
which pass through the spoiler will develop RMS scat-
tering angles of 19 µradians in horizontal and vertical;
combined with the dispersive beam size at the absorber
(ησδ = 500µm), the expected size of a beam at the ab-
sorber which ﬁrst passes through the spoiler is 660 µm.

Survival of the 0.5 R.L. spoiler is also a consideration.
At the spoiler location in the energy collimation region,
σr = 89µm. For the NLC bunch train at 500 GeV per
beam, the minimum beam size for survival of a 0.5 R.L.
beryllium spoiler is approximately 50 µm, thus we have
chosen beryllium as the material for the spoilers [3].

The collimation depth in energy should be narrower than
the bandpass over which beams are well-behaved in the ﬁ-
nal focus. The present system is designed to remove ±1%
off-energy particles, which requires a half-gap of 1.3 mm
for the spoilers and 2.0 mm for the absorbers.

The jitter ampliﬁcation effect of collimator wakeﬁelds
must be minimized at all points in the collimation system.
In the energy collimation region, the ratio ηx/βx is large
and thus the collimator wakeﬁelds primarily couple energy
jitter into horizontal position jitter. This aberration is can-
celled by placing a second spoiler-absorber pair at a loca-
tion which is −I in betatron optics from the ﬁrst pair but
with equal dispersion functions. The cancellation is only
exact for on-energy particles, but the expected energy jitter
of 0.22% only causes a horizontal jitter of 0.5% of σx. A
similar effect is caused by high-order dispersion, but the ef-
fect is approximately 1/3 as large as the residual wakeﬁeld
jitter contribution.

3.2 Betatron Collimation

Because large betatron oscillations are not expected to de-
velop during one inter-pulse period, it is expected that the
betatron collimators will rarely be hit by the beam core.
The baseline design for the betatron collimation system,
which is the system pictured in Figure 2, utilizes “con-
sumable” spoilers, in which the spoilers can be moved to
present a fresh surface to the beam after every incident of
beam-core interception; we assume that 1,000 such inci-
dents can occur per year of operation. An alternative de-
sign would permit damage on every pulse and require that
the collimators be self-repairing, “renewable” collimators.
While more techincally challenging, the renewable colli-
mators would permit smaller apertures to be used, which in
turn would permit smaller betatron functions.

The system in Figure 2 is based on a triplet lattice with
phase advances of π/2 and 3π/2 per cell in horizontal and
vertical, respectively. Thus the system collimates in two
phases, two planes, two iterations per phase/plane. Each
high-beta region in the system contains 2 adjustable spoil-
ers (x and y) and 2 ﬁxed cylindrical absorbers. Multiple
coulomb scattering in the spoilers gives the halo a large
angular divergence, which causes particles to hit the ab-
sorbers in the next cell.

The required collimation aperture is set by acceptable
limits on synchrotron radiation in the ﬁnal doublet. Based
on studies of the 1996 ﬁnal focus [4], the nominal spoiler
half-gaps are approximately 200 µm for 500 GeV beams.
The ﬁxed absorbers have a round aperture with a radius
of 1 mm. Spoilers and absorbers are 0.5 and 20.0 R.L.,
respectively.

The vertical jitter ampliﬁcation factor for the betatron
collimation system is 46%, smaller than the 66% expected
for the 1996 design. For the expected incoming jiter (0.375
σy), the collimators contribute 0.17 σy jitter in quadrature
with the incoming jitter. These estimates are based on ana-
lytic models for collimators with a z taper and a large x/y
aspect ratio [5]; however, recent experiments indicate that
the actual wakeﬁeld effect may be smaller than this [6].
The horizontal jitter ampliﬁcation is expected to be about
half that of the vertical.

4 SCATTERING STUDIES

The efﬁciency of primary-particle collimation and the pro-
duction of muons which are transmitted to the IP were stud-
ied using a combination of TURTLE, EGS, and MUCUS
(MUltiple CoUlomb Scattering program).

4.1 Primary Particles
Figure 3 shows the halo attenuation based on tracking of
2 million halo particles which originate at a point on one
collimator. Figure 3 (a) shows the attenuation for particles
240 µm from the beam axis at each of the ﬁrst 4 spoil-
ers (2 vertical, 2 horizontal); the attenuation is shown for
cases in which off-energy primary particles are collimated
downstream of the collimation system (eliminating parti-
cles which are more than 2% off-energy), and cases with-
out downstream energy attenuation. The attenuation is typ-
ically between 0.6 × 10−5 and 8 × 10−5, while the desired
value is 0.1 × 10−5. Figure 3 (b) shows the attenuation as
a function of source offset for the ﬁrst spoiler.

sired attenuation. (b): Attenuation as a function of primary

Note that these estimates are preliminary, and recent
studies have indicated that a substantial improvement may
be achieved by optimizing the z positions of the spoilers.
Also, increasing the spoiler thickness to 1.0 R.L. would im-
prove attenuation by an order of magnitude, but the result-
ing energy deposition in the spoilers would have to be stud-
ied.

4.2 Muon Secondaries
The problem of muon secondaries from the post-linac col-
limators entering the detector is more severe than it was for
the 1996 NLC design, primarily because the collimation
system and ﬁnal focus are shorter in the present design (2.5

km per side compared to 5.2 km per side), which puts all
sources of muons closer to the IP. In the present design, we
include two large magnetized toroids for muon attenuation
on each side of the IP; despite this, we expect on the order
of several hundred muons per linac pulse to enter the muon
endcap of a detector similar to the “LCD Large” design
[7], as well as tens of muons per linac pulse in the elec-
tromagnetic calorimeter. These studies were performed for
500 GeV beams; for 250 GeV beams, 2 orders of magni-
tude improvement are expected. The muon rate can also
be reduced by adding additional spoilers, reducing the halo
intensity, or constructing a smaller detector (such as “LCD
Small”). Since the 500 GeV center-of-mass (CM) results
are quite acceptable, a reasonable approach to the muon
situation might be to build the system with 2 muon toroids
and spaces allocated for additional toroids, to be added in
later years if required.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE

DIRECTIONS

We have presented an optics design for the Next Linear
Collider post-linac collimation system which addresses the
difﬁculties in the previous system design. The new system
has weaker optics, looser tolerances, larger bandwidth, and
better wakeﬁeld properties than the original. The new sys-
tem is somewhat poorer than desired in the areas of halo
attenuation and muon production; future work will seek to
address this weakness..

The present energy collimator includes a 5 milliradian
arc, which changes the angle between the linac and the ﬁnal
focus. Recent developments in ﬁnal focus design have ex-
panded the potential energy reach of the NLC [8]; in order
to take full advantage of this change, we plan to redesign
the collimation system to either a dogleg or a chicane, such
that the post-linac system and the linac are co-linear and the
former can be expanded by “pushing back” into the latter
when the linac gradient and energy are increased.

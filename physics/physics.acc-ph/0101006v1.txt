We present the application of variational-wavelet analysis to numerical/analytical
calculations of Wigner functions in (nonlinear) quasiclassical beam dynamics prob-
lems. (Naive) deformation quantization and multiresolution representations are the
key points.

1 INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider some starting points in the applications of a new
numerical-analytical technique which is based on local nonlinear harmonic
analysis (wavelet analysis, generalized coherent states analysis) to the quan-
tum/quasiclassical (nonlinear) beam/accelerator physics calculations. The
reason for this treatment is that recently a number of problems appeared in
which one needs take into account quantum properties of particles/beams.Our
starting point is the general point of view of deformation quantization ap-
proach at least on naive Moyal/Weyl/Wigner level (part 2). The main point
is that the algebras of quantum observables are the deformations of commuta-
tive algebras of classical observables (functions) [1].So, if we have the Poisson
manifold M (symplectic manifolds, Lie coalgebras, etc) as a model for clas-
sical dynamics then for quantum calculations we need to ﬁnd an associative
(but non-commutative) star product ∗ on the space of formal power series in
¯h with coeﬃcients in the space of smooth functions on M such that

f ∗ g = f g + ¯h{f, g} +

¯hnBn(f, g),

Xn≥2

where {f, g} is the Poisson brackets, Bn are bidiﬀerential operators C∞(X) ⊗
C∞(X) → C∞(X). There is also an inﬁnite-dimensional gauge group on the
set of star-products

f 7→ f +

¯hnDn(f ),

Xn≥2
where Dn are diﬀerential operators. Kontsevich gave the solution to this de-
formation problem in terms of formal power series via sum over graphs[1]. He

also proved that for every Poisson manifold M there is a canonically deﬁned
gauge equivalence class of star-products on M. Also there is the nonperturba-
tive corrections to power series representation for ∗ [1]. In naive calculations
we may use simple formal rules:

In this paper we consider calculations of Wigner functions (WF) as the

and especially stationary Wigner equations:

H ∗ W = W ∗ H = Ef

Our approach is based on extension of our variational-wavelet approach
[3]-[14]. Wavelet analysis is some set of mathematical methods, which gives us
the possibility to work with well-localized bases (Fig. 1) in functional spaces
and gives maximum sparse forms for the general type of operators (diﬀer-
ential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential) in such bases. These bases are natural
generalization of standard coherent, squeezed, thermal squeezed states [2],
which correspond to quadratical systems (pure linear dynamics) with Gaus-
sian Wigner functions. So, we try to calculate quantum corrections to classical
dynamics described by polynomial nonlinear Hamiltonians such as orbital mo-
tion in storage rings, orbital dynamics in general multipolar ﬁelds etc. from
papers [3]-[13]. The common point for classical/quantum calculations is that
any solution which comes from full multiresolution expansion in all space/time
(or phase space) scales represents expansion into a slow part and fast oscil-
lating parts (part 4). So, we may move from the coarse scales of resolution to
the ﬁnest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical
classical/quantum process. In this way we give contribution to our full solu-
tion from each scale of resolution. The same is correct for the contribution to
power spectral density (energy spectrum): we can take into account contribu-
tions from each level/scale of resolution. Because aﬃne group of translations

and dilations (or more general group, which acts on the space of solutions) is
inside the approach (in wavelet case), this method resembles the action of a
microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution
from the whole underlying inﬁnite scale of spaces. In part 5 we consider nu-
merical modelling of Wigner functions which explicitly demonstrates quantum
interference of generalized coherent states.

2 Quasiclassical Evolution

Let us consider classical and quantum dynamics in phase space Ω = R2m
with coordinates (x, ξ) and generated by Hamiltonian H(x, ξ) ∈ C∞(Ω; R). If
ΦH
: Ω −→ Ω is (classical) ﬂow then time evolution of any bounded classical
t
observable or symbol b(x, ξ) ∈ C∞(Ω, R) is given by bt(x, ξ) = b(ΦH
t (x, ξ)).
Let H = OpW (H) and B = OpW (b) are the self-adjoint operators or quantum
observables in L2(Rn), representing the Weyl quantization of the symbols H, b
[1]

(Bu)(x) =

(8)

where u ∈ S(Rn) and Bt = eiHt/¯hBe−iHt/¯h be the Heisenberg observable or
quantum evolution of the observable B under unitary group generated by H.
Bt solves the Heisenberg equation of motion ˙Bt = (i/¯h)[H, Bt]. Let bt(x, ξ; ¯h)
is a symbol of Bt then we have the following equation for it

˙bt = {H, bt}M ,

(9)

with the initial condition b0(x, ξ, ¯h) = b(x, ξ). Here {f, g}M (x, ξ) is the Moyal
brackets of the observables f, g ∈ C∞(R2n), {f, g}M (x, ξ) = f ♯g − g♯f , where
f ♯g is the symbol of the operator product and is presented by the composition
of the symbols f, g

(f ♯g)(x, ξ) =

·f (x + ω, ρ + ξ) · g(x + r, τ + ξ)dρdτ drdω

e−i<r,ρ>/¯h+i<ω,τ >/¯h

(10)

For our problems it is useful that {f, g}M admits the formal expansion in
powers of ¯h:

{f, g}M (x, ξ) ∼ {f, g} + 2−j ·

where α = (α1, . . . , αn) is a multi-index, |α| = α1 + . . . + αn, Dx = −i¯h∂x.
So, evolution (1) for symbol bt(x, ξ; ¯h) is

At ¯h = 0 this equation transforms to classical Liouville equation. Equation
(12) plays the key role in many quantum (semiclassical) problems. We con-
sider its particular case–Wigner equation–in the next section.

3 Wigner Equations

According to Weyl transform quantum state (wave function or density opera-
tor) corresponds to Wigner function, which is analog of classical phase-space
distribution [2]. We consider the following form of diﬀerential equations for
time-dependent WF

to a ﬁnite number of terms in equations (18), (19) up to any order of ¯h.

4 Variational Multiscale Representation

Let L be arbitrary (non)linear diﬀerential operator with matrix di-
functions Ψ ≡ Ψ(x, y) =
mension d, which acts on some set of

Ψ1(x, y), ..., Ψd(x, y)

,

x, y ∈ Ω ⊂ ℜ2 from L2(Ω):

(cid:17)

LΨ ≡ L(Q, x, y)Ψ(x, y) = 0,

(20)

(cid:16)

where

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for solution as the following
ansatz (in the same way we may consider diﬀerent ansatzes):

ΨN (x, y) =

ar,sΨr(x)Φs(y)

N

Xr,s=1

We shall determine coeﬃcients of expansion from the following Galerkin con-
ditions (diﬀerent related variational approaches are considered in [3]-[13]):

ℓN
kℓ ≡

Z

(LΨN )Ψk(x)Φℓ(y)dxdy = 0

So, we have exactly dN 2 algebraical equations for dN 2 unknowns ars.

But in the case of equations for WF (18), (19) we have overdetermined
system of equations: 2N 2 equations for N 2 unknowns ars (in this case d = 1).

(22)

(23)

Capri-ICFA-Proc-1: submitted to World Scientiﬁc on February 2, 2008 5

In this paper we consider non-standard method for resolving this problem,
which is based on biorthogonal wavelet expansion. So, instead of expansion
(22) we consider the following one:

ΨN (x, y) =

ar,sΨr(x)Ψs(y) +

Φj (y) are the bases dual to initial ones. Because wavelet functions
where
are the generalization of coherent states we consider an expansion on this
overcomplete set of bases wavelet functions as a generalization of standard
coherent states expansion.

e

So, variational/Galerkin approach reduced the initial problem (20) to the
problem of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some alge-
braical problems at the second stage. We’ll consider now the multiresolution
expansion as the second main part of our construction. Because aﬃne group
of translation and dilations is inside the approach, this method resembles the
action of a microscope. We have contribution to ﬁnal result from each scale
of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of increasing closed subspaces Vj:
...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ .... The solution is parametrized by solutions
of two reduced algebraical problems, one is linear or nonlinear (23) (depends
on the structure of operator L) and the second one are some linear problems
related to computation of coeﬃcients of algebraic equations (23). These co-
eﬃcients can be found by the method of Connection Coeﬃcients (CC)[15] or
related method [16]. We use compactly supported wavelet basis functions for
expansions (22), (24). We may consider diﬀerent types of wavelets including
general wavelet packets (section 5 below). These coeﬃcients depend on the
wavelet-Galerkin integrals. In general we need to ﬁnd (di ≥ 0)

According to CC method [15] we use the next construction for quadratic case.
When N in scaling equation is a ﬁnite even positive integer the function ϕ(x)
has compact support contained in [0, N − 1]. For a ﬁxed triple (d1, d2, d3)
only some Λd1d2d3
2 − N ≤ m ≤ N −
|ℓ − m| ≤ N − 2. There are M = 3N 2 − 9N + 7 such pairs (ℓ, m).

Let Λd1d2d3 be an M-vector, whose components are numbers Λd1d2d3
. Then
we have the following reduced algebraical system : Λ satisfy the system of

By moment equations we have created a system of M + d + 1 equations in
M unknowns. It has rank M and we can obtain unique solution by combi-
nation of LU decomposition and QR algorithm. For nonquadratic case we
have analogously additional linear problems for objects (25). Solving these
linear problems we obtain the coeﬃcients of reduced main linear/nonlinear
algebraical system (23) and after its solution we obtain the coeﬃcients of
wavelet expansion (22), (24). As a result we obtained the explicit solution of
our problem in the base of compactly supported wavelets (22).

Also in our case we need to consider the extension of this approach to
the case of any type of variable coeﬃcients (periodic, regular or singular). We
can produce such approach if we add in our construction additional reﬁnement
equation, which encoded all information about variable coeﬃcients [16]. So,
we need to compute only additional integrals of the form

bij(t)(ϕ1)d1 (2mt − k1)(ϕ2)d2(2mt − k2)dx,

(27)

ZD

where bij(t) are arbitrary functions of time and trial functions ϕ1, ϕ2 satisfy
the reﬁnement equations:

ϕi(t) =

aikϕi(2t − k)

(28)

Xk∈Z

Xα∈Z

If we consider all computations in the class of compactly supported wavelets
then only a ﬁnite number of coeﬃcients do not vanish. To approximate the
non-constant coeﬃcients, we need choose a diﬀerent reﬁnable function ϕ3
along with some local approximation scheme

(Bℓf )(x) :=

Fℓ,k(f )ϕ3(2ℓt − k),

(29)

where Fℓ,k are suitable functionals supported in a small neighborhood of 2−ℓk
and then replace bij in (27) by Bℓbij(t). To guarantee suﬃcient accuracy of
the resulting approximation to (27) it is important to have the ﬂexibility of
choosing ϕ3 diﬀerent from ϕ1, ϕ2. So, if we take ϕ4 = χD, where χD is
characteristic function of D, which is again a reﬁnable function, then the
problem of computation of (27) is reduced to the problem of calculation of
integral

H(k1, k2, k3, k4) = H(k) =

ϕ4(2jt − k1) ·

(30)

The key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort of algebraical
equation [16]:

2−|µ|H(k) =

b2k−ℓH(ℓ),

µ = d1 + d2.

This equation can be interpreted as the problem of computing an eigenvec-
tor. Thus, the problem of extension of our approach to the case of variable
coeﬃcients is reduced to the same standard algebraical problem as in case of
constant coeﬃcients. So, the general scheme is the same one and we have only
one more additional linear algebraic problem. After solution of these linear
problems we can again compute coeﬃcients of wavelet expansions (22), (24).
Now we concentrate on the last additional problem which comes from
overdeterminity of equations (18), (19), which demands to consider expansion
(24) instead of expansion (22).
It leads to equal number of equations and
unknowns in reduced algebraical system of equations (23). For this reason
we consider biorthogonal wavelet analysis. We started with two hierarchical
sequences of approximations spaces [16]: . . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 . . . ,
. . .
V2 . . . , and as usually, W0 is complement to V0 in
V1, but now not necessarily orthogonal complement. New orthogonality con-
e

ditions have now the following form:

k), ˜ϕ(x − ℓ) >= δkl, < ϕ(x − k), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) >= 0
for ∀k, ∀ℓ. Functions ϕ, ˜ϕ
generate a multiresolution analysis. ϕ(x−k), ψ(x−k) are synthesis functions,
˜ϕ(x − ℓ), ˜ψ(x − ℓ) are analysis functions. Synthesis functions are biorthogonal
to analysis functions. Scaling spaces are orthogonal to dual wavelet spaces.
Two multiresolutions are intertwining Vj + Wj = Vj+1,
Vj+1.
These are direct sums but not orthogonal sums. So, our representation for
˜bjkψjk(t), where synthesis wavelets are
solution has now the form f (t) =
used to synthesize the function. But ˜bjk come from inner products with anal-
ysis wavelets. Biorthogonal point of view is more ﬂexible and stable under the
action of large class of operators while orthogonal (one scale for multiresolu-
tion) is fragile, all computations are much more simple and we accelerate the
rate of convergence of our expansions (24). By analogous anzatzes and ap-
proaches we may construct also the multiscale/multiresolution representations
for solution of time dependent Wigner equation (13) [14].

of Wigner equations (18)-(19):

where Ψr(p), Φs(q) may be represented by some family of (nonlinear) eigen-
modes with the corresponding multiresolution/multiscale representation in

Our (nonlinear) eigenmodes are more realistic for the modelling of nonlinear
classical/quantum dynamical process than the corresponding linear gaussian-
like coherent states. Here we mention only the best convergence properties
of expansions based on wavelet packets, which realize the so called minimal
Shannon entropy property (Fig. 1). On Fig. 2 we present numerical modelling
[17] of Wigner function for a simple model of beam motion, which explicitly
demonstrates quantum interference property. On Fig. 3 we present the multi-
scale/multiresolution representation (32)-(34) for solution of Wigner equation.

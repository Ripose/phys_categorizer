RESONANT LASER COOLING OF

CIRCULAR ACCELERATOR BEAMS

R.V. TUMANIAN∗, Yerevan Physics Institute,Armenia

December 23, 2012

Abstract

The resonant laser cooling of circular accelerator beams of relativistic

charged particle is studied. It is shown that in the approximation of the

given external electromagnetic wave amplitude (small gain free electron

laser) the emittance of a beam of charged particles decreases. In the ﬁeld of

particle energy about 100 in the mass energy units the beam energy losses

are negligible. The discovered eﬀect can be used for cooling of charged

particle beams in various accelerators. The signiﬁcant cooling rates are

possible to achieve by placing of the cooling device in the appropriate

points of the accelerator orbit. Resonant laser cooling for various cases are

considered. This method of charged particle beams cooling can be applied

to circular accelerators of electron and various relativistic heavy particle

beams and has signiﬁcantly, about 3-4 orders of magnitude, shorter cooling

time in comparison to any other cooling method.

1 Introduction

The increasing of the accelerator beam lifetime and luminosity is very impor-
tant. But the beam lifetime and emmitance is restricted by various eﬀects. For
example, in the electron cyrcular accelerators the beam lifetime is restricted
by synchrotron radiation, especially in the machines with combined function

In the proton and
magnets as ARUS (Yerevan) and old DESY (Germany).
ion cyrcular accelerators the beam lifetime and emmitance is restricted by the
diﬀerent scattering eﬀects. The inﬂuence of these eﬀects on the beam lifetime
and emittance can be decreased by applying of any eﬀective cooling method.
So, the cooling of charged particle beams is a very important issue for attaining
of higher lifetime and luminosity beams. To date, variuos methods of cooling
are used in various accelerators: there are radiative [1], electron [2], stochastic
[5] and Doppler [6] cooling. The ﬁrst method is mainly used to cool electron
or light particle beams in circular accelerators and storage rings. Electron cool-
ing proposed by Budker [2] advantageous to cool proton and heavy particle
beams. Exellent reviews on cooling of charged particle beams are given in [3]-
[?]. Stochastic cooling is applicable to various particle beams, but it is very
slow. Doppler cooling is used for ion beams. In [8] laser cooling of relativistic
ion beam is observed. The lowest temperature of a laser cooled stored ion beam
is reported in [9]. However, above methods do not meet the modern require-
ments. For instance, these methods do not provide the high luminosity beams
in linear, circular accelerators and storage rings. Also they have small cooling
eﬃciency resulting in long cooling time.

Moreover, there are no eﬀective cooling methods for high energy, relativistic
particle beams used in linacs and colliders.
In order to improve the cooling
eﬃciency new methods have been proposed, among which we note a resonant
laser [10, 11], an undulator [12], ionization cooling [13], the stimulated radiation
or stimulated Doppler cooling [16], and the 3-dimensional laser cooling [14].

Transverse laser cooling of ions is demonstrated in the [15]. Cooling by back-
ward Compton scattering of free electrons on photons is of a special interest
[17]-[19]. It is known, however, that the stimulated scattering under the same
conditions has a greater cross-section [16], [20], than the cross-section of free
particle scattering. Therefore, in contrast to cooling methods depicted above, it
is advantageous to consider stimulated or resonant scattering. In this paper we
discuss the applicability of stimulated or resonant interaction of particles with a
ﬂat electromagnetic wave (photons) for fast transverse cooling of a beam of rela-
tivistic charged particles. The resonant bunch - wave interaction is mediated by
applying the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, directed along of a beam movement
direction. The magnetic ﬁeld creates beam current density correlations propor-
tional to laser wavelength. This increases bunch - wave interaction and makes
it selective. The usual and known distribution functions, for example Gaus-
sian or Boltzman, are useful for ensembles of particles with irregular, stochastic
trajectories, when the exact trajectories are not known and the ensemble is
described by the density of probability of particle states. When particles are
moved at certain trajectories, i.e. we know the particle state, the distribution
is not purely probabilistic, rather it becomes correllated. This can be seen from
the distribution function of particles with certain trajectories, which is equal to
usual distribution function for random variables, for example momentum, after
substituting exact trajectories instead of random variables. Since the trajecto-
ries depend on time, the distribution function depends on time too. This show
that temporary evolution of the ensemble is not probabilistic, and is determined

2

by the certainity of trajectories. All average macroscopic values of the system
depend on time and we know exactly their temporal evolution, which means
that correlations of states of particles exist in such system.

2 Physical principles of resonant laser cooling

2.1 Introduction

Interaction of electrons, which move by periodic trajectories, with a ﬂat monochro-
matic electromagnetic wave is one way of ampliﬁcation of an electromagnetic
wave in the free electron laser. The autoresonant free electron laser [21] based on
the interaction of the charged particle with the electromagnetic wave extending
along a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B0 k z, is characterized by the fact that
detuning from an exact resonance stays independent on charged particle energy
changes. In [22] it was shown , that detuning is constant due to the existence
of the integral of motion I

I = γ − Pz,

(1)

which is applicable only in a constant external wave approximation. Here γ is
the full energy, and Pz is the momentum of a particle along magnetic ﬁeld (in
the system of units with m=c=1). This formula can be obtained easily from the
usual hamiltonian of a charged particlle in the presence of a plane laser wave
proportional to expi(ωt − kz). The dependence on time means that energy is not
conserved and hamiltonian is not a motion integral. The new motion integral can
be found from the Hamiltonian by using the canonical transformation φ = t − z.
After such transformation of z, the new hamiltonian equals to I and do not
depend on time. The time independence of the new Hamiltonian means that
new energy I is conserved and I is a motion integral. In this article we examine
the inﬂuence of autoresonant interaction of a particle with a wave on a transverse
beam emittance. Taking into account the expression γ =
+ 1, it is
easy to receive from (1) for a transverse kinematical momentum of a particle

As shown in works [21]-[23], the trajectories of electrons are spirals which radii
vary along the way. As the drift of the center of a Larmor circle is absent and
I ≥ 0, interaction in the mode of the laser ( ˙γ < 0) means reduction of a beam
transverse emittance, because of the negativity of the right hand side of (2).

Here and below the dot means the diﬀerentiating on time. In the laser mode
the ampliﬁed wave carries out a part of beam energy.

It is very important to ﬁnd which part of the energy is taken out from
full beam energy and which part is taken from beam transverse emittance, i.e.
what cnstitutes beam cooling (emittance reduction). As it is not diﬃcult to
receive from (1), relative speed ˙Pz/Pz of a longitudinal momentum change is

2.2 Equations of motion

In the limit of inﬁnitesimal changes of a transverse momentum during the beam
interaction with a wave, i.e. if motion in a transverse plane is determined by a
magnetic ﬁeld B0, it is easy to receive for ˙γ in the ﬁeld of the circular-polarized

Averaging on all particles of a beam in the equation (2) allows to investigate
the average beam size, using the kinetic approach instead of particle-by-particle
detailed trajectory analysis. If a weak (in comparison to the magnetic ﬁeld ~B0)
electromagnetic wave with ~E, ~B ∼ expi(ωt − kz) is present, there are correla-
tions of density which result in modulation of a beam on ϕ and accordingly, give
a nonzero right hand side in (2). To quantify this eﬀect we shall present distri-
bution function of a beam as [24] f = f0 + δf , where f0 is the basic equilibrium
function of distribution, and |δf | ≪ f0 is the small addition to f0 caused by
a wave. Close to a resonance it is convenient to write the addition as Fourier
, Pz)exp(isϕ). Substituting this in the kinetic equation
series ϕ : δf =

gs(P

and neglecting terms of the second order, gives the following expressions for
factors

The left inequality lets us to describe an adiabatic switching of a wave ﬁeld. As
in our case the ﬁeld is switched instantly, the approximation of the adiabatic
slow wave ﬁeld change is fair at times greater than relaxation time. That is
expression (6) for fair if the beam has passed a way greater than 2p2
0λ. We
shall emphasize that the condition (11) comes from a method of calculation.
The equation (2) is fair in the approximation of the given external ﬁeld, when
Langmuir (plasma) frequency of a beam is much less than frequency of the
laser [22]. It speciﬁes relation between a beam transverse momentum variation
and an energy variation. For a beam of charged particles with P0 = 100 and
2 the length of a way on which
divergence ϑ = 10−
transverse emittance changes by 100 percents is about 80 cm, while the length of
the relaxation is about 20cm. This example shows that very short cooling time
is achievable by using resonant laser cooling. Thus, the autoresonant cooling
of beams of relativistic charges has some advantages. First, it is much faster
and has shorter cooling time, than other cooling methods mentioned in the
introduction. Second, this method is applicable as to circular accelerators and
storage rings as well as in linear accelerators. Thirdly, though this method is
most eﬀective for beams with the Lorenz-factor about 100, is also can be used
to cool GeV particles. The method allows to reach cooling rates comparable to
that described in [17, 18] by the use of electromagnetic radiation sources with
much lower intensities. We notice that formulae which describe cooling depend
on parameter ξ, which is easier be made of the value of about unity in long-wave
radiation sources such as masers.

Fourth, there is a possibility of application of a longitudinal or transversal
non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld that enables scanning in case of a beam with large
divergence.

3 Dynamics of a circular accelerator beam in

the presence of resonant laser cooling

3.1 Introduction

We consider in this section the inﬂuence of resonant laser cooling device on the
beam dynamics of the circular accelerator. The beam dynamics in the presence
of focusing forces of the accelerator is described by betatron oscillations around
equilbrium orbit [25]. During these oscillations the divergence (transverse mo-
mentum) and position of a particle varying periodically and the points of the
maximum of one of them are the points of minimum of the other. So, the chang-
ing of the divergence of a particle by the resonant wave-beam interaction results
in the appropriate changing of the particle position in respect to equilibrum or-
bit. This means, that the beam divergence reduction result in the accelerator
beam size reduction. Therefore, the resonant beam-wave interaction result in
decreasing of the betatron oscillation amplitude, i.e.
in the accelerator beam
cooling. This cooling is possible to apply in two regimes: fast cooling and slow
cooling regimes. The ﬁrst one is more suitable in case of electron beam due to a
possibility to achieve very high cooling rates of light particles, such as electrons.
This regime is necessary also for decreasing of the inﬂuence of the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld on the beam dynamics. This regime is considered in the ﬁrst
subsection. In the second subsection is considered the case of slow cooling more
suitable for heavy particles such as protons and ions, but applicable to electrons
too, under certain conditions .

3.2 Fast cooling regime

In this subsection we consider the case of signiﬁcant changing, about unity or
more times, of the beam angular divergence by resonant laser cooling on each
turn on the accelerator orbit in the cooling device.This means that divergence
decreased instantly and signiﬁcantly at the cooling device. Such cooling regime
is possible in case of cooling of electrons with γ about 100 by CO2 laser with
intensity about 5-6 kW and magnetic ﬁeld about 5-6 T. For describing of such
process we consider the instantenous decreasing of the beam divergence k times
by passing through cooling device. It is well known, that the transverse dynam-
ics of the beam with emitance E in the focusing lattice of the accelerators is
described by the ellipse [25]

y2 + (αy + βy′)2 = βE

(12)

7

where y and y’ denotes the transverse coordinate and the angular divergence,
respestively. After passing the cooling device the transverse divergence in two
transverse directions is decreased in accordance to (7). For eﬀective cooling it
is neccesary to place the cooling device in those points of the accelerator orbit,
where y’ is maximal. Usually, these points are the centers of free spaces and in
these points the relation [25]

take place. So, the decreasing of the angular divergence k times means the
decreasing of the transverse emmitance k2 times. By using the relation [25]

y′max =

E(1 + α2)/β

p

ymax =

Eβ

p

(13)

(14)

one can ﬁnd, that the mean square transverse size of the accelerator beam is
decreased by factor k. The necessary cooling rate depend on laser intensity
and pulse duration deﬁned by period of one turn. Laser with intensity 5-6 kW
decreases the transverse size of the electron beam with γ = 100 approximately
<< 1 the longitudinal momentum change is
2 times on each turn. In case p
negligible. Notice, that such decreasing of beam transverse size means decreas-
ing of the beam emittance and increasing of the accelerator luminosity and of
the beam lifetime in depend on factors which limited the beam lifetime.

⊥

3.3 Slow cooling regime

In this subsection we consider the case of small change of beam divergence by
one pass through cooling device. This regime is more suitable in case of γ about
1000 and in case of heavy particles: protons and ions. It is clear, that in this
case the cooling time is very long and we can consider the square rout of the
equation (6) as a component of a force in the transverse directions [25]

Notice, that in this case the cooling time is longer than in case of fast cooling
considered in the previous subsection about 100 times, but much shorter than
the heating time, which is about or longer than msec for electrons with γ about
10000. So, even in this case and with laser of lower intensity the resonant laser
cooling is very eﬀective. The longitudinal cooling force can be found from the
equation (3) by assuming, that the average longitudinal momentum p0 equals to
equilibrum momentum ps, which is deﬁned, as well known, by the resonanticity
of accelerating process.

It is necesary to note, that the p0 in the right hand size is a given function
of time determined by acceleration. This force give an additional term in the

8

longitudinal cooling rate determined by synchrotron radiation. Cooling time
equals to [25]

tcool = ζ( − 1) = (F c/E0)−

1

(17)

where the E0 is the equilibrum energy of the particle. Calculations show, that
by using of solenoid with magnetic ﬁeld about 5-10 T and laser with power 5-10
mW, the cooling time is about few seconds for heavy particles with γ = 100.
The protons of this energy it is possible to cool by laser with wavelenght 10
mcm (CO2 laser) but ions with maser with wavelength about or shorter 1mm.
For comparison we calculate the cooling time of ions by electron cooling in the
magnetic ﬁeld about 5-10 T and we ﬁnd 10000 sec. So, the cooling time of
resonant laser cooling of heavy particles is 10000 times shorter, than cooling
time of electron cooling.

4 Conclusion

The resonant laser cooling, i.e. the laser cooling of particle beams in a longitu-
dinal magnetic ﬁeld has a number of advantages as compared with the newest
laser [17, 18] and undulator cooling methods. This method provides much faster
cooling given that all other conditions are the same. The cooling time of about
few mcsec is achieveble in case of cooling of electrons in comparison to few msecs
in other methods, for example, damper-magnets. In case of relativistic heavy
particles the cooling time of about few seconds are achieveable in comparison to
104 seconds cooling time of electron cooling. More realistic intensities of lasers
(masers) are necessary in comparison to other laser cooling methods. Resonant
laser cooling, if applied, can increase signiﬁcantly the luminosity and lifetime
of synchrotron accelerator beams, due to beam emittance decrease. All this
advantages come from the using of the stimulated radiation of the beam in the
autoresonant laser for beam cooling. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. I am thankful

is chosen for the CDR generation and an expression is obtained for the scattered
photon spectrum with regard to the geometry used, that depends in an explicit form

scattered radiation characteristics.

1. Introduction

∼

∼

The process of Compton backscattering (CBS) of the infra-red or visible photons by the
relativistic electrons was used widely for obtaining X-ray - and γ – beams with the energy
from

1010eV [1-4].

106eV up to

The development of laser technologies within recent years has brought up a suggestion
to use the CBS process for electron bunch diagnostics [5-7]. The authors of an experi-
ment [7] used a femtosecond near infrared terawatt laser as a source of radiation which
was scattered on a bunch of electrons with the energy E = 50 MeV. They proposed to
use this process for the measurement of electron bunch characteristics (longitudinal and
transverse bunch sizes, divergence, etc.) The longitudinal bunch structure, for instance,
was measured via the dependence of the scattered hard photon yield on the time delay
between the electron and photon bunches.

It is clear that the accuracy of such measurements relies on the reproducibility and
controllability of characteristics of a powerful laser, which is a rather complicated problem.
In further works [8,9] it was proposed to measure the bunch length through such char-
acteristics of coherent transition radiation (i.e. the transition radiation with a wavelength
comparable with the bunch length), as the radiation spectrum and the autocorrelation
function. In the latter cases one is free from the errors associated with the laser. However,

the methods so far proposed are not non-destructive (viz. the electron beam crosses the
foil target).

This paper considers a possibility of electron beam diagnostic using Thomson scat-
tering of CDR from the preceding bunch on the following one. Diﬀraction radiation is
produced when a charged particle moves close to a conducting target. The eﬀects of the
target on beam characteristics could be reduced to an acceptable level by choise of the
distance between the beam and target. Thus, the method proposed here is nondestructive
as are the methods involving the use of laser emission, nonetheless, characteristics of the
scattered hard radiation are determined only by the electron beam parameters.

2. Thomson scattering of radiation by a moving bunch.

During the interaction of an incident photon with a moving electron the scattered

photon energy is to be derived using the conservation laws:

1

ω2 = ω1

−
β cos θ2 + ω1
E {
Here ω1, ω2 and E are the energies of the incident and scattered photons and that
of the electron, respectively, β = v/c, v is the electron velocity, the angles between the
electron momentum and the incident and scattered photons θ1, θ2 are the same as in [6].

In a frame where the electron is at rest (ERF), the energy of the photon scattered,
is, according to (2), suﬃciently less than the electron mass. The photon scattering then
occurs virtually without any frequency changing and, therefore, the scattering process
may be described in terms of classical electrodynamics (Thomson scattering).

In the ERF the classical cross section of scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a

free charge [10] is not controlled by its frequency and is given by the expression:

In (5), ro = 2.82

The total cross section derived through integrating expression (7) with respect to

angles is the Thomson cross section:

The yield of secondary photons upon scattering, e.g. of incident laser photons, on a
moving electron bunch is to be determined not only by the cross section of the process
but also by the overlapping of the laser and electron beams in space and time, which is
characterized by luminosity L:

Let us consider the head-on collision of electron and photon bunches. Luminosity in this
case is deﬁned as follows:

L = cNeNphF

Here Ne , Nph are the number of particles in the electron and photon bunches, fe , fph

electron numbers and bunch size attainable this value is considerably small. Therefore,
one typically uses radiation of a powerful laser as a primary beam.

However, eﬀective overlapping of the laser and accelerator bunches is a diﬃcult task,
while linear dependence of the scattered beam intensity (8) on the number of electrons in
the bunch poses natural restrictions on the intensity of the resulting X-ray or γ-beam. If
a beam of incident photons is to be generated by one of the preceding electron bunches
of the accelerator, then the temporal and longitudinal structures of the colliding bunches
will be similar.

It seems possible that one can use a beam of coherent radiation of a short electron
bunch as a primary beam of soft photons.
In this case, the radiation intensity in the
wavelength region λ1, comparable with the bunch length, is quadratically dependent on
the number of electrons in the bunch [12], which compensates for the low reﬂectivity of
the electron bunch. Instead of a laser source, coherent diﬀraction radiation (CDR), i.e.
the radiation produced while a short bunch of electrons is passing close to a metal target
[13], can be taken as a source of primary radiation.

Fig. 1 shows a potential experimental scheme. Electron bunches pass through a
circular opening of the radius R in a metal target, which results in generation of CDR
le, the electrons are deﬂected by a bending magnet BM,
in the wavelength region λ1
while CDR is reﬂected and focused by a thin concave mirror CM on one of the following
bunches. The scattered photons with the energy corresponding to the X-ray region are
extracted through the center hole of the mirror CM, suﬀering but a small loss. The
distance between the center hole of the mirror and the target, Lo, is selected from the

In expression (17) J0(x) is the Bessel function of the zeroth order, K1(x) is the mod-

after
integration with respect to the solid angle covered by the reﬂected mirror. Calculated

As one may see from (24) the scattered yield has the cubic dependence on the number

of electrons per bunch.

Other authors [15,16] considered electromagnetic radiation produced by the collision
of short electron bunches and also arrived at a cubic dependence of the photon yield with

the energy ω <

during collision of identical bunches.

Roughly speaking, the works mentioned earlier studied scattering of the ﬁeld of virtual
photons of one bunch on the other, while this paper deals with the process where real
photons emitted by the preceding bunch are scattered on one of the following bunches.

One may see from (26) that the yield of scattered photons does not depend on the
electron energy, if the maximum outgoing angle θ2max is measured in units γ−1. Of course,
the scale of transformation of the photon energy is deﬁned by the electron energy (see
Eq.(3)).

The spectrum (26) is shown in Fig. 3 for diﬀerent ratios between σe and le. There are
the clear broad maxima whose positions are determined by the ratio r = σe/le. With this
ratio decreasing spectral maximum shifts to the value

ω2max =

and the intensity rises due to increasing luminosity. Let us estimate the photon yield
at the maximum for following parameters: Ne = 1010e−/bunch; σe = le=1mm; k1 =

For the electron energy E = 1000 MeV the photons scattered at the spectral maximum

However, the estimation of the yield obtained above is valid only if the focusing mirror

oriented along the target edge), the spectral-angular distribution of DR is written in a

positioned at a distance  L0
the resulting expression (33) could be used for estimation of the hard photon yield when

transition radiation do not allow us to measure the length of submillimeter bunches. In
this context, measurement of the detuning curve by mechanical displacement of the fo-
cusing mirror seems to oﬀer a means for measuring even shorter bunches with the use of
simpler equipment than a streak camera.

It should be noted that the CBS process of laser photons on an electron bunch was
considered in 90◦ geometry [21], and it was shown that for a certain geometry and bunch
parameters the yield of scattered photons may be by 2-3 orders exceed that from scattering
on Ne electrons independent of each other. The enhancement factor, dictated by the

coherent compton scattering, is proportional to Ne

It is to be expect that during

scattering of CDR on the following electron bunch the eﬀect of coherence could be made
manifest in as more pronounced fashion, since the wavelength of primary radiation is by
2-3 orders higher than laser emission wavelength and, secondary, the coherent Thomson
scattering would involve the dependence of the number of secondary photons on the
number of electrons per bunch to be proportional to N 4

Photon colliders: The ﬁrst 25 years ∗

Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia

Abstract

In this invited talk at the “historical” session of PHOTON2005, I was asked to recount
the history and the development, from its earliest days to the present, of the idea of photon
colliders based on conversion of high energy electrons to high-energy photons at a future
high-energy linear e+e− collider. Described in this talk are the general features and schemes
of a photon collider, the evolution in understanding of what the parameters of a realistic
photon collider are, possible solutions of various technical problems, the physics motivation,
and the present status of photon-collider development. For a more detailed description of
the photon collider at the ILC and a discussion of the associated technical issues, please
refer to my talks at PLC2005, the conference that immediately followed PHOTON2005 (to
be published in Acta Physica Polonica B as well).

1 Prehistory and the idea of the photon collider

Photon colliders do not exist yet, but already have a rich 25-year history. The early history
of γγ physics, studied mainly in collisions of virtual photons at e+e− storage rings, has been
presented at PHOTON2005 by S. Brodsky [1] and I. Ginzburg [2]. Hence, I begin my narration
by describing the circumstances that led to the birth of the idea of the high-energy photon
collider. This is the ﬁrst time I share an account of these events with the public; this conference,
subtitled “The Photon: its First Hundred Years and the Future,” provides an appropriate venue
for such historical reviews. I will also mention the story of the observation of C = + resonances
in γγ collisions at SLAC in 1979, which is also an important event in the γγ history.

Two-photon physics had been talked about since 1930s, but as an active research ﬁeld is
began in early 1970s, when production of e+e− pairs was discovered in collisions of virtual
photons at the e+e− storage ring VEPP-2 in Novosibirsk and theorists realized that this method
can be used to study a variety of two-photon processes.

To study two-photon physics at a greater depth, we in Novosibirsk decided to build MD-
1, a dedicated detector with a transverse magnetic ﬁeld and a tagging system for scattered
electrons. Before experiments at the VEPP-4 collider started, in 1978–79 I had the privilege
of having been able to visit SLAC for four months and work with the Mark II group, where I
observed two-photon production of the η′ and f2 mesons. It then became clear that tagging of
the scattered electrons is not neccesary for study of many two-photon processes; the MARK II
paper on two-photon η′ production [3] triggered a wave of results from all e+e− experiments.

Many interesting two-photon reactions were studied in the years that followed, but the
results could not compete with the revolutionary discoveries made in e+e− annihilation. The
reason for this is that the luminosity and the energy in virtual γγ collisions are small. Indeed,
the number of equivalent photons surrounding each electron is dNγ
0.035dω/ω, and the

corresponding γγ luminosity for Wγγ/2E0 > 0.2 is only Lγγ
order of magnitude smaller than for Wγγ/2E0 > 0.5.

The other important element that led to the conception of the idea of high-energy photon
colliders is the activity on e+e− linear colliders in Novosibirsk. In December 1980, the First
USSR workshop on the physics at VLEPP was held in Novosibirsk [4]. Only one talk on γγ
physics was on the agenda, an overview by I. Ginzburg and V. Serbo of the physics of two-
photon production of hadrons at VLEPP energies (in collisions of virtual photons). I was not
planning to give any talks, but several days before the workshop began to think about the
possibility of converting electrons to real photons in order to increase the γγ luminosity at
VLEPP. At the discussion session, which was part of the workshop’s schedule I gave a short
talk on this subject using blackboard.

The idea was rather simple. At linear colliders, electron beams are used only once, which
makes it possible to convert electrons to photons, and thus to obtain collisions of real photons.
All that is needed is some sort of a target at a small distance from the interaction point (IP),
where the conversion would take place. For example, if one were to place a target of 0.3X0
thickness, the number of bremsstrahlung photons would be greater than the number of virtual
photons by one order of magnitude, and the corresponding γγ luminosity would increase by
two orders of magnitude; however, this approach suﬀers from photo-nuclear backgrounds. I
continued my talk by saying that there are other methods of conversion: for example, crystals
are better than amorphous targets because the eﬀective X0 is much shorter, leading to smaller
backgrounds; undulators produce photons whose energies are too low. . . At this exact moment
G. Kotkin interjected from his chair, “Lasers !”. In fact, this method was already well-known
in our community: at SLAC, Compton backscattering had been used since mid-1960s for
production of high-energy photons; in Novosibirsk, such a facility had been constructed for
our experiments at VEPP-4 for the measurement of the electron polarization in the method of
resonant beam depolarization.

During the following discussion, several people expressed quite a negative reaction to the

summary on two-photon physics written for the workshop proceedings by Ginzburg, Serbo and
me, there was only one paragraph about the photon-collider idea, with the conclusion that a
more detailed study is needed.

→

Immediately after this workshop, a group of γγ enthusiasts, namely: I. Ginzburg (Institute
of Mathematics), G. Kotkin (Novosibirsk State University), V. Serbo (also NSU) and V. Telnov
(INP) decided to pursue the method of the laser photon conversion further: if feasible, it would
be the best among all the alternatives. It was a very exciting study, and contributions from all
members of this team were vitally important to make possible the ﬁrst publication and further
advances on the concept of photon colliders.

The method of production of high-energy photons by Compton scattering of laser light oﬀ
high-energy electrons was proposed in 1963 by Arutyunian, Goldman and Tumanian [5] and
independently by Milburn [6], and soon afterwards was utilized [7, 8]. However, the conversion

1, seven orders of magnitude more !
We determined the required laser ﬂash energy, then checked the literature on powerful
lasers, consulted with laser experts, and found that lasers with required ﬂash energies, about
10 J, already existed, albeit with much longer pulse durations and lower repetition rates than
those required by a photon collider (the repetition rate in the VLEPP project circa 1980 was
only 10–100 Hz, compared with 15 kHz in the present ILC design). Discussions with laser
experts gave us some hope that these problems will be solved in future. Extrapolating the
progress of laser technologies into the next two decades and adding our optimism, we came to
the conclusion that a photon collider based on laser photon conversion is not such a crazy idea
and deserves being published.

The preprint INP 81-50, dated February 25, 1981 (in English), was sent to all major HEP
laboratories and to many individual physicists, but publication of the corresponding paper
was a problem. The original submission of our paper to Pisma ZHETPh was rejected: “...
the editorial board does not consider worthwhile a rapid publication of your article because the
realization of such an experiment is not possible in the near future ...
lasers of the required
parameters do not exist ... and their creation is not likely in near future.” We resubmitted the
article to the same journal with additional comments, but once again received a conﬁrmation
of the previous refusal. We then sent the paper to Physics Letter, were was declined as well,
”...the article is very interesting but does not need urgent publication. You can publish it, for
example, in Nuclear Instruments and Methods.” What do we do? Fortunately, in August 1981
we had a chance to meet personally with I. Sobelman, the editor of Pisma ZHETPh, who was
visiting Novosibirsk; following that meeting, the paper was published on November 5, 1981
(received March 10) [9]. Two additional, more detailed papers written in 1981–1982 [10, 11]
were published in NIM; their combined citation index now surpasses 1000.

In September 1981, C. Akerlof of the Univ. of Michigan published a preprint [12] that
contained a similar idea. However, he considered only γe collisions and underestimated the
required laser ﬂash energy by 1–2 orders of magnitude. That was after two of our preprints [9,
10], and mentioning of the photon-collider concept in August 1981 at the Symposium On
Lepton And Photon Interactions At High Energies in Bonn in VLEPP status report [13]. In
November 1981, Kondratenko, Pakhtusova and Saldin from our institute suggested the use of
single-pass free-electron lasers in a future photon collider [14].

In the following sections, we consider the main principles and features of photon colliders,
the technical issues, and how the laser and linear-collider technologies and our understanding
of them evolved with time.

Two remarks are in order. Firstly, we consider only high-energy photon colliders of
luminosities that are of real interest to particle physics. As for low-energy photon-photon
scattering, in 1928–30 S. Vavilov in attempted detection of scattering of visible photons from
two lamps [15]; later, people experimented with laser photons, but these experiments also failed
due to the very small cross section for photon-photon scattering at low energies. There existed
ideas of using synchrotron radiation, beamstrahlung photons, and even nuclear explosions
(Csonka [16]) to study photon-photon interactions. Beamstrahlung photons can indeed have
high energies, but the idea is not practicable as collisions of virtual photons at storage rings
provide a much higher luminosity.

Secondly, it is well known that during collisions at e+e− linear colliders electrons and
positrons emit hard photons, about one such photon per electron. So, simultaneously with

3

e+e− collisions, for free, one gets a photon-photon collider of a high luminosity and a rather
high energy (typically several percents of the beam energy, but can be higher). At very high
energies, the average energy of such beamstrahlung photons is about 25% of the electron energy.
In 1988, R. Blankenbecler and S. Drell even considered the prospects for such a photon-photon
collider in the quantum beamstrahlung regime [17]. The disadvantages of this method are the
following [18]: one needs a multi-TeV linear collider (or very small beam sizes), the luminosity
is limited by beam-collision instabilities, the photon spectrum is wide, and in the strong ﬁeld
(Υ > 1) of the opposing beam the high-energy photons will convert to e+e− pairs. At the
photon colliders based on Compton backscattering, beamstrahlung photons contribute to the
low-energy part of the γγ luminosity spectrum and are taken into account in all simulations.

2 Nomenclature of linear-collider projects

Over the past two decades, several projects of linear colliders were in existence, see Table 1.
Only one of them, the SLC, was actually built and operated quite successfully at Z-boson
energy. The SLC was quite a special linear collider, constructed on the base of the existing
SLAC linear accelerator by adding two arcs to achieve e+e− collisions. Its luminosity was about
3 orders of magnitude lower than the the luminosity that can be obtained at an optimized
linear collider. At present, two projects remain: the International Linear Collider (ILC) with
the energy of up to 1 TeV and the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) with the energy of up to
3 (perhaps, 5) TeV. Neither of the projects has been approved; however, there is an “intent”,
and a hope, to have the ILC built by 2015.

3 Basics of the photon collider

Here, we brieﬂy consider the main characteristics of backward Compton scattering and the
requirements on the lasers.

3.1 Kinematics and photon spectra

In the conversion region, a laser photon of energy ω0 collides with a high-energy electron of
energy E0 at a small collision angle α0 (almost head-on). The energy of the scattered photon

The energy spectrum of the scattered photons depends on the average electron helicity λe
and that of the laser photons Pc. The “quality” of the photon beam, i.e., the relative number
of hard photons, is improved when one uses beams with a negative value of λePc. The energy
spectrum of the scattered photons for x = 4.8 is shown in Fig. 1 for various helicities of the
electron and laser beams.

scattered photons.

With increasing x, the energy of the backscattered photons increases, and the energy spec-
trum becomes narrower. However, at large values of x, photons may be lost due to creation of
e+e− pairs in the collisions with laser photons [10, 18, 19]. The threshold of this reaction is
ωmω0 = m2c4, which corresponds to x = 2(1 + √2)
4.83. One can work above this thresh-
old, but with a reduced luminosity; the luminosity loss factor is about 5–10 for x = 10–20.
Therefore, x
4.8 is the most preferable value. The optimum wavelength of the laser photons

corresponding to x = 4.8 is

photons in the high-energy peak have a high degree of like-sign polarization. A high degree of
circular photon polarization is essential for the study of many physics processes.

3.2 Multi-photon (nonlinear) eﬀects at the conversion region

The electromagnetic ﬁeld in the laser wave at the conversion region is very strong, and so
electrons can interact with several laser photons simultaneously. These nonlinear eﬀects are
characterized by the parameter [22, 23, 25]

The transverse motion of an electron through the electromagnetic wave leads to an eﬀective
increase of the electron’s mass: m2
m2(1 + ξ2), and so the maximum energy of the scattered
photons decreases: ωm/E0 = x/(1+x+ξ2). At x = 4.8, the value of ωm/E0 decreases by about
5% for ξ2 = 0.3. For ﬁgures demonstrating evolution of the Compton spectra as a function of
ξ2 please refer to Refs. [25, 26]. With increasing ξ2, the Compton spectrum is shifted towards
lower energies, and higher harmonics appear; the part of the γγ luminosity spectra that is due
to nonlinear eﬀects becomes broader. So, the value of ξ2
0.3 can be taken as the limit for
x = 4.8; for smaller values of x it should be even lower. The complete set of formulae for pair
production in the laser wave for any combination of polarizations and ﬁeld strengths can be
found in Ref.[27].

Nonlinear eﬀects also exist in e+e− creation at the conversion region in collisions of laser and
high-energy photons [23, 24, 26, 20]. There exist some other interesting eﬀects in the conversion
region, such as the variation of polarization of electrons [28] and high-energy photons [29] in
the laser wave.

3.3 Laser ﬂash energy

While calculating the required ﬂash energy, one must take into account the diﬀractive diver-
gence of the laser beam and to keep small the nonlinear parameter ξ2. The r.m.s. radius of
the laser beam near the conversion region depends on the distance z to the focus (along the
beam) as [10]

Note that the required ﬂash energy decreases when the Rayleigh length is reduced to σz, but
it hardly changes with further decreasing ZR. This happens because the density of photons
grows but the length decreases, and as result the Compton scattering probability remains nearly
constant. It is not helpful either to make the radius of the laser beam at the focus smaller

More precise calculations of the conversion probability in head-on collision of an electron with
a Gaussian laser beam can be found elsewhere [10, 18, 19, 21]; they are close to the above
estimate.

However, this is not a complete picture, since one should also take into account the following

eﬀects:

•

•

Nonlinear eﬀects in Compton scattering. The photon density is restricted by this eﬀect.

For shorter bunches, nonlinear eﬀects will determine the laser ﬂash energy.

Collision angle. If the laser and electron beams do not collide head-on (if the laser optics

is outside the electron beam), the required laser ﬂash energy is larger by a factor of 2–2.5.

•

Transverse size of the electron beam. In the crab-crossing scheme, the electron beam is
tilted, which leads to an eﬀective transverse beam size comparable to the optimum laser spot
size.

Simulations show [36, 30, 61] that if all the above eﬀects are taken into account, the required
ﬂash energy for the photon collider at the ILC with 2E0 = 500 GeV and for λ = 1.05 µm is

4 The most important advances in photon colliders

4.1 Early considerations, collision schemes

In early 1980s, two linear colliders were under consideration: VLEPP [31] and SLC [32]. For
the photon collider, we used the parameters presented in Table 2.

For e+e− collisions at VLEPP ﬂat beams were considered from the beginning. As the
ﬂatness was not necessary for γγ, for simplicity we considered round beams with the same
beam cross section. At SLC, round beams were planned even for e+e−. These parameters
diﬀer very much from those in the present projects.

The second fact that inﬂuenced the initial consideration of the photon-collider scheme was
the minimum focal spot size achieved with powerful lasers: it was about 20 µm, much larger
than the optimum one for a diﬀraction-limited laser beam.

The originally proposed scheme of the photon collider is shown in Fig. 3 [9, 10]. The laser
light is focused on the electron beam in the conversion region C, at a distance of b
10 cm
from the interaction point O; after Compton scattering, the high-energy photons follow along
1/γ, i.e., they are
the initial electron trajectories with a small additional angular spread
focused in the interaction point O. Electrons are swept away by a magnetic ﬁeld B
1 T. The
obtained γ beam collides downstream with the oppositely directed electron beam or another γ
beam. The required laser ﬂash energy (for VLEPP or SLC parameters) was about 10–20 J.

reduction of the spot sizes to their diﬀraction limits (we considered such beams as a limiting
case).

In the following year, the vertical beam sizes in LC projects decreased down to 3–5 nm. It
became clear that on order to maximize the γγ luminosity, it is necessary to focus the beam
both in the vertical and horizonal directions to the smallest possible spot cross section σxσy.
Damping rings naturally produce beams with a vertical emittance that is much smaller than
the horizontal emittance, so the resulting photon beams at the IP are ﬂat (though not as ﬂat
as in e+e− collisons). For σy = 3 nm, the optimum b
1.5 mm for 2E0 = 500 GeV.
This space is way too small to ﬁt any kind of a magnet. Therefore, since 1991 [33], we have
been considering the scheme with no magnetic deﬂection, Fig. 4 (upper). In this case, there is
a mixture of γγ, γe and e−e− collisions, beamstrahlung photons give a very large contribution
to the γγ luminosity at the low and intermediate invariant masses, the backgrounds are larger,
and the disruption angles are larger than in the scheme with magnetic deﬂection. However,
there are certain advantages: the scheme is simpler, and the luminosity is larger. As for the
backgrounds, they are larger but tolerable.

Note, that even without deﬂecting magnets there is the beam-beam deﬂection which sup-
press residual e−e− luminosity. Also at large CP-IP distances and a non-zero crossing angle
the detector ﬁeld serves as the deﬂecting magnet and allows to get more or less clean and
monochromatic γγ, γe collisions with reduced luminosity which will be useful for QCD stud-
ies [34].

4.2 The removal of beams

After crossing the conversion region, the electrons have a very broad energy spectrum, E=(0.02–
1) E0, and so the removal of such a beam from the detector is far from obvious. In the scheme
with magnetic deﬂection, all charged particles travel in the horizontal plane following the
conversion. At the IP, they get an additional kick from the oncoming beam, also in the
horizontal plane. This gave us a hope that the beams can be removed through a horizontal slit
in the ﬁnal quadrupoles; that was a feasible, but a diﬃcult-to-implement solution.

In 1988, R. Palmer suggested the crab-crossing scheme for e+e− collisions at the NLC

scheme, the beams are collided at a crossing angle, αc. In order to preserve the luminosity,
the beams are tilted by a special cavity by the angle αc/2. This scheme solves the problem
of beam removal at photon colliders [18]: the disrupted beams just travel straight outside the
quadrupoles.

In the scheme without magnetic deﬂection (which is now the primary scheme), the disrupted
beams have an angular spread of about
10 mrad after the IP [26, 36]. The required crossing
angle is determined by the disruption angle, the outer radius of the ﬁnal quadrupole (about
25
5 cm), and the distance between the ﬁrst quad and the IP (about 4 m), which gives αc
mrad.

4.3 Luminosity
In e+e− collisions, the maximum achievable luminosity is determined by beamstrahlung and
beam instabilities. At ﬁrst sight, in γγ,γe collisions at least one of the two beams is neutral, and
so the beams do not inﬂuence each other; however, it is not so. Beam-collision eﬀects at photon
colliders were considered in Refs. [18, 19]. The only eﬀect that restricts the γγ luminosity is the
conversion of the high-energy photons into e+e− pairs in the ﬁeld of the opposing beam, that
is, coherent pair creation [37]. The threshold ﬁeld for this eﬀect κ = (Eγ/mc2)(B/B0)
1,
1013 Gauss is the Schwinger ﬁeld and B is the beam ﬁeld. For
where B0 = αe/r2
γe collisions, the luminosity is determined by beamstahlung, coherent pair creation and the
beam displacement during the collision. All these processes, and a few others, were included
into the software codes for simulation of beam collisions at linear colliders by K. Yokoya [38],
V. Telnov [19] and D. Schulte [39]. The code [19] was used for optimization of the photon
colliders both at NLC [21] and TESLA [79, 26].

It is interesting to note that at the center-of-mass energies below 0.5–1 TeV and for electron
beams that are not too short, the coherent pair creation is suppressed due to the broadening
and displacement of the electron beams during the collision [40, 41]: the beam ﬁeld becomes
lower than the threshold for e+e− production. So, one can even use inﬁnitely narrow electron
beams.

Simulated γγ and γe luminosities (in the high energy peak) for TESLA (and, similarly,
for ILC) are shown in Fig. 5 [55, 56]. This ﬁgure shows how the luminosity depends on the
horizontal beam size. One can see that all γγ luminosity curves follow their natural behavior:
1/σx. Note that for e+e−, the minimum horizontal beam size restricted by beamstrahlung
L
10 nm at 2E0 = 500 GeV,
is about 500 nm, while the photon collider can work even with σx
delivering a luminosity that is several times higher than that in e+e− collisions! In fact, the
γγ luminosity is simply proportional to the geometric e−e− luminosity.

Unfortunately, the beam emittances in the damping-ring designs currently under consid-
5 nm, though
eration do not allow beam sizes that are smaller than σx
a reduction of σx by a factor of two seems possible. In principle, one can use electron beams
directly from low-emittance photo-guns, avoiding the need for damping rings altogether, but
at present they oﬀer a product of the transverse emittances that is noticeably larger than can
be obtained with damping rings (note: the beams should be polarized).

To further reduce the beam emittances downstream of the damping rings or photo-guns,
one can use the method of laser cooling of the electron beams [42, 43, 44]. This method opens
the way to emittances that are much lower than those obtainable at damping rings—however,
this method requires a laser system that is much more powerful than the one needed to achieve
the e
γ conversion. So, laser cooling of electron beams at linear colliders is a technology for
use in a γγ factories in the distant future.

→

The typical γγ, γe luminosity spectra for the TESLA-ILC(500) parameters are shown in
Fig. 6 [26]. They are decomposed to states with diﬀerent spins Jz of the colliding particles. The
luminosity spectra and polarizations can be measured using various QED processes [45, 46].
At the nominal ILC parameters (foreseen for e+e− collisions), the expected γγ luminosity
0.15–0.2 Le+e− [36]. By reducing
in the high-energy peak of the luminosity spectrum Lγγ
emittances in the damping rings (which is not easy but possible by adding wigglers), Lγγ
∼
(0.3–0.5) Le+e− can be acieved. Note that cross sections for many interesting processes in γγ
collisions (e.g., charged pairs, Higgs bosons, etc) are higher than those in e+e− collisions by
about one order of magnitude (see [26] and references therein), so in all cases the number of
events in γγ collisions will be greater than in e+e−.

∼

A few words about multi-TeV energies. Due to beamstrahlung, the maximum energy of
a e+e− linear collider of a reasonable luminosity is 2E0
5 TeV [48], which can be reached
with the CLIC technology. At high-energy photon colliders with short bunches, coherent pair
creation plays a role that is similar to the role of beamstahlung in e+e−. In the high-energy
limit, σγ/σe+e− = 3.8 [49, 50], which means that the energy reach of the photon colliders is
approximately the same as in the e+e− case [41, 49, 50, 51]. In principle, one can imagine
rather long electron bunches with a special transverse shape, such that in the process of beam
collision the electrons are spread by the opposing beam in a more-or-less symmetrical fashion,

two spectra. The residual e−e− luminosity (not shown) is one order of magnitude smaller due
to beam repulsion.

so that the beam ﬁeld near the axis (where the photons travel) is small, and so there is no
coherent pair creation [49]. In this case, photon colliders can reach much higher energies; alas,
this is quite an unrealistic dream.

4.4 The laser schemes and technologies

The photon collider at the ILC(500) requires a laser system with the following parameters (see
Sect. 3.1): the ﬂash energy A
1 µm, and the following ILC pulse
structure: 3000 bunches within a 1 ms train and 5 Hz repetition rate for the trains, the total
collision rate being 15 kHz. These parameters are quite similar to those discussed for VLEPP,
only the collision rate has increased by a factor of a thousand.

As has already been mentioned above, in 1981 the short-pulse Terawatt lasers required for
by a photon collider were just a dream. A breakthrough in laser technologies, the invention
of the chirped pulse ampliﬁcation (CPA) technique [52], occurred very soon, in 1985.
In
this case, “Chirped” means a time–frequency correlation within the laser pulse. The main
problem in obtaining short pulses was the limitation of the peak power imposed by the nonlinear
refractive index of the medium. This limit on intensity is about 1 GW/cm2; the CPA technique
successfully overcame it.

∼

The principle of CPA is as follows. A short,

100 fs low-energy pulse is generated in an
oscillator. Then, this pulse is stretched by a factor of 104 by a pair of gratings, which introduces
a delay that is proportional to the frequency. This several-nanosecond-long pulse is ampliﬁed,
and then compressed by another pair of gratings into a pulse of the initial (or somewhat longer)
duration. As nonlinear eﬀects are practically absent in the stretched pulses, the laser pulses
obtained with the CPA technique have a quality close to the diﬀraction limit. This technique
now allows the production of not merely TW, but even PW laser pulses, and in several years
the Exawatt level will be reached. Fig. 7 [53] shows the increase of the laser energy density in

12

W/cm2 vs. year for table-top laser systems. In 1981, the corresponded power was about
GW. The minimum power required by the photon collider was achieved roughly in 1992.

10

∼

Figure 7: Laser intensity vs. year for table-top system. The progress in 1960s and 1970s was
due to Q-switching and mode locking; after 1985, owing to the chirped-pulse technique.

The next, very serious problem was the laser repetition rate. The pumping eﬃciency of
traditional ﬂash lamps is very low; the energy is spent mainly on heating of the laser medium.
In addition, the lifetime of ﬂash lamps is too short, less than 106 shots. Semiconductor diode
lasers solved these problems. The eﬃciency of diode laser pumping is very high, and heating
of the laser medium is low. The lifetime of the diodes is suﬃcient for the photon collider.

In addition to the average repetition rate, the time structure is of great importance. The

(1$)/W, the pumping eﬃciency about 25%, so the cost of
(100M $), and the size of the facility would be very large.
Fortunately, there is a solution. A 10 J laser bunch contains about 1020 laser photons, only
about 1011 of which are knocked out in a collision with the electron bunch. So, it is natural
to use the same laser bunch multiple times. There are at least two ways to achieve this: an
optical storage ring and an external optical cavity.

∼

×

In the ﬁrst approach, the laser pulse is captured into a storage ring using thin-ﬁlm polarizers
and Pockels cells [21, 55, 26]. However, due to the nonlinear eﬀects that exist at such powers,
it is very problematic to use Pockels cells or any other materials inside such an optical storage
ring.

Another, more attractive approach, is an “external” optical cavity that is pumped by a
laser via a semi-transparent mirror. One can create inside such a cavity a light pulse with an
intensity that is by a factor of Q (the quality factor of the cavity) greater than the incoming
laser power. The value of Q achievable at such powers is 100–200. The optical-cavity principle

is illustrated in Fig. 8. The cavity should also include adaptive mirrors and other elements for
diagnostic and adjustment.

Figure 8: External optical ring cavity for the photon collider

While working on photon colliders, I was in contact with many laser experts; incredibly,
no one ever said a word about “external” optical cavities.
It was in early 1999 [57, 54, 58]
that I came to the idea of such a cavity from ﬁrst principles, checked the literature, and found
that such cavities already existed, were used in a FEL experiments, in the gravitational-wave
experiment LIGO, and in the optical laboratories. Only then did I ﬁnally come to believe in
the technical feasibility of the photon collider with TESLA-ILC pulse structure and started to
push it vigorously [55, 59, 26]. Working on the TESLA TDR at DESY in 1999–2000, I got the
people from the Max Born Institute (Berlin) involved in the work on the optical cavity, and
they further advanced this scheme [60, 61]; now, it is the baseline approach for the laser system
at the ILC.

Advancements in laser technologies is being driven by several large, well-funded programs,
such as inertial-conﬁnement fusion. This is a very fortunate situation for photon colliders
as we would beneﬁt from the last two decades of laser-technology developments that have
cost hundreds of millions of dollars each year. They are: the chirped-pulse technique, diode
pumping, laser materials with high thermoconductivity, adaptive optics (deformable mirrors),
disk ampliﬁers with gas (helium) cooling, large Pockels cells, polarizers, high-power and high-
reﬂectivity multi-layer dielectric mirrors; anti-reﬂection coatings, etc. Now, practically the all
laser technologies and components required for a photon collider are in existence; nevertheless,
the construction of such a state-of-the-art laser system would not be an easy task.

One should not forget free-electron lasers either. These might be single-pass SASE FEL
lasers or ampliﬁers [14, 62], though they require an excessively high electron current. More
attractive is an FEL amplifying a chirped laser pulse [33] that is then compressed by grating
pairs, as in solid-state lasers. In this case, one can use much longer electron bunches. Such
FELs with CPA were considered in Ref. [21, 63] (single-pass) and in Ref.[64] (a multi-pass
regenerative ampliﬁer). FEL facilities are much larger than the “table-top” solid-state lasers,
but FELs have certain advantages for trains with small inter-bunch spacing; in particular, they
have no problems with pumping and overheating of the laser medium.

5 Physics

The γγ and γe capabilities can be added to a high-energy e+e−linear collider at a small fraction
of the cost of the entire project. Although the γγ luminosity in the high-energy part of the
spectrum will be lower than in e+e− by a factor of 3–5, the cross sections in γγ collisions are
typically greater by a factor of 5–10, so the number of “interesting” events would surpass that
in e+e− collisions. Moreover, a further increase of the achevable γγ luminosity by up to one
order of magnitude cannot be excluded.

Since the photon couples directly to all fundamental charged particles—leptons, quarks,
W ’s, supersymmetric particles, etc.—the photon collider provides a possibility to test every
aspect of the Standard Model, and beyond. Besides, photons can couple to neutral particles
(gluons, Z’s, Higgs bosons, etc.) through charged-particle box diagrams. See S. Brodsky’s
review talk at this conference for more details [1].

Many theorists took part in the development of the physics program for the photon collider;

the total number of publications has surpassed the 1000 mark.

The physics program of the photon collider is very rich and complements in an essential
way the physics in e+e− collisions under any physics scenario. In γγ, γe collisions, compared
to e+e−,

•
•
•

the energy is smaller only by 10–20%;
the number of interesting events is similar or even greater;
access to higher particle masses (single resonances in H, A, etc., in γγ, heavy charged
and light neutral (SUSY, etc.) in γe);
at some SUSY parameters, heavy H/A-bosons will be seen only in γγ;
higher precisions for some phenomena;
diﬀerent types of reactions;
highly polarized photons.

•
•
•
•
So, the physics reach of a γγ, γe and e+e− colliders is comparable. The only advantage of
e+e− collisions is the narrower luminosity spectrum, the feature that is of rather limited use.
The photon collider can be added to the linear e+e− collider at a very small incremental
cost. The laser system and modiﬁcation of the IP and one of the detectors would add about
3–4% to the total ILC cost. Some decrease of the e+e− running time is a negligible price to
pay for the opportunity to look for new phenomena in other types of interactions.

More about physics at γγcolliders can be found in reviews [1, 26, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70],

references therein, and many other papers.

6 Studies, projects, politics

Photon colliders were discussed at the series of LC, LCWS and PHOTON workshops/conferences,
and at many others. In the beginning, these were single talks, then working groups formed, and
then International Workshops on Photon Colliders took place in Berkeley in 1994 (A. Sessler) [71];
at DESY in 2000 (R. Heuer, V. Telnov) [59]; at FNAL in 2001 (M. Velasco) [77]; in Warsaw,
2005 (M. Krawczyk) [78], as well many smaller meetings.

15

Several LC projects have been in existence: VLEPP, NLC, JLC, TESLA, SBLC, CLIC—
and each one of them foresaw the γγ, γe option. In 1996–1997, three LC projects published
their Conceptual Designs with chapters or appendices describing a second IP, dedicated for a
photon collider: NLC [21] (ed. K.-J. Kim), TESLA/SBLC [79] (ed. V. Telnov), JLC [80, 81]
(ed. T. Takahashi, I. Watanabe).
In February 1999, at the γγ mini-workshop on photon
colliders in Hiroshima, it was decided to organize an International Collaboration on Photon
Colliders. This was announced at LCWS1999, and approximately 150 physicists signed up.
The work was done, presumably, within the framework of regional studies.

All that time, photon colliders were considered ﬁrst and foremost as a natural additions
to the e+e− collider projects. However, there were several short-lived suggestions to build
dedicated photon colliders with no e+e− collisions at all: a 10 GeV γγ collider for study
of b-quark resonances [72], a 100–200 GeV γγ collider for “Higgs hunting” [73], a “proof-of-
principle” photon collider at the SLC [74], a photon collider on the basis of the CLIC test
facility [75]. In my mind, suggesting a linear collider with no e+e− collisions when most people
dream about e+e− is just not serious. “Test” colliders with low energy or luminosity would be
a waste of resources.

A few words about dedicated γγ workshops. At LC92, I spoke to Andy Sessler about
photon colliders and asked him to give a talk on the possible application of FELs for photon
colliders. He did so, and “in addition” organized the ﬁrst workshop on γγ colliders (Berkeley,
1994 [71]), gave a talk on photon colliders at PAC95, and wrote a paper on photon colliders
for Physics Today [76].

The second International Workshop on the High Energy Photon Colliders [59] (GG2000)
was organized at DESY as a part of work on the Photon Collider for the TESLA TDR [26].
Together with accelerator physicists, we found that after some optimization of the damping
0.3Le+e− can be achieved. Now, even
rings and the ﬁnal focus system, Lγγ(z > 0.8zm)
some of the past opponents of photon colliders agreed that γγ, γe should be built. As for
the technical feasibility, the very attractive idea of an external optical cavity was already in
existence in 2000.

∼

The primary motivation behind GG2001 [77] at FNAL was the idea of e

γ conversion
using crystals instead of lasers. It was rejected, completely and outright, due to the destruction
of crystals by the very dense electron beams, large photo-nuclear backgrounds and defocusing
by the beam produced plasma; this was quite obvious from the very beginning [4, 18].

→

Now, let me discuss the present situation. Due to the high costs of building a high-energy
linear collider, the international HEP community agreed to build one collider for the energy
2E0 = 0.5–1 TeV instead of three (TESLA, NLC and JLC). In 2004, the ILC project, based
on the superconducting TESLA-like technology, was inaugurated. According to the consensus
document titled “Understanding matter:
...the case for the Linear Collider” [82], which was
signed by three thousands supporters, the ILC should have an interaction region compatible
with the photon collider. So, the next steps are the ILC design, cite selection, obtaing govern-
ment approval and funding, and the construction. Under the best-case scenario, ILC operation
may start in 2015. “To be or not to be” for the sub-TeV linear collider depends both on the
energy scale of new physics, which should become known soon after the start of experiments
at the LHC, and on multiple other scientiﬁc and political factors.

If the ILC is built, in the ﬁrst few years it will operate in the e+e− mode in all (1 or 2) of

its detectors. Then, one of the IPs would be modiﬁed for the γγ, γe mode of operation.

16

Unfortunately, life is not easy for the advocates and supporters of the photon collider at
the ILC. For many years, the photon collider has been considered an “option” in the“baseline”
e+e− collider design. In real life, “option” meant no support, and no money. Nevertheless,
the interest of the physics community in having the photon collider built is tremendous. For
example, the number of articles in the SPIRES database (publications only) that mention linear
colliders or photon (gamma) colliders in their titles are, respectively, approximately 2950 and
600. These numbers speak for themselves.

In the conclusion of my sermon, let me share with you an instructive story from the very
early days of collider physics. When G. Budker proposed to build the ﬁrst e+e− storage ring
in Novosibirsk, responses of all three referees were negative. However, I. Kurchatov, head of
the USSR nuclear program, overruled the skeptics: ”If the referees are so unanimously against
it, it means that the project is really interesting”—and gave the green light to e+e− colliding
beams. So, nothing new is ever easily done.

In summary: the physics expected in the 0.1–1 TeV region is very exciting, there is a big
chance that a linear collider will be built somewhere in the world, and then the photon collider
will inevitably happen.

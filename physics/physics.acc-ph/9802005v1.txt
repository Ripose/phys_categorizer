MUON COLLIDER:
INTRODUCTION AND STATUS

R. B. Palmer for the Muon Collider Collaboration1

Abstract. Parameters are given of machines with center-of-mass (CoM) energies
of 3 TeV and 400 GeV but, besides a comment on neutrino radiation, the paper
concentrates on progress on the design of a machine to operate at a light Higgs
mass, assumed, for this study, to be 100 GeV (CoM).

INTRODUCTION

The possibility of muon colliders was introduced by Skrinsky et al. [1] and
Neuﬀer [2]. More recently, a collaboration of over 100 members,
lead by
BNL, FNAL, LBNL, BNIP, University of Mississippi, Princeton University
and UCLA has been formed to coordinate studies on speciﬁc designs. Work
has been done on designs at a 3-4 TeV, 0.4-0.5 TeV and ≈100 GeV [3–7].
Tb. 1 gives the parameters of such colliders, and Figs. 1 and 2 show possible
outlines of the 3 TeV and 100 GeV machines.

The original motive for considering muon colliders was the eﬀective energy
advantage of any lepton collider over hadron machines, together with the fact
that muons, unlike electrons, generate negligible synchrotron radiation. As a
result, a muon collider can be circular and much smaller than the current de-
signs of linear electron colliders, and also much smaller than a hadron machine
with the same eﬀective energy.

In addition, a µ+µ−collider would have some unique physics advantages over

an e+e−collider:

• The direct coupling of a lepton-lepton system to a Higgs boson has a cross
section that is proportional to the square of the mass of the lepton. As a
result, the cross section for direct Higgs production from the µ+µ−system
is 40,000 times that from an e+e−system.

• Because of the lack of beamstrahlung, a µ+µ−collider can be operated
with an energy spread of as little as 0.003 %. Furthermore, with the
naturally occurring polarization it would be possible, by observing g-
2, to determine the absolute energy to an accuracy of 10−6 or better
[8]. It should thus be possible to use a µ+µ−collider to make precision
measurements of masses and direct measurements of the Higgs width
(assumed to be ≈ 2 MeV), that would be otherwise impossible, with an
e+e−collider.

Machines with energies higher than 3-4 TeV, have signiﬁcant beam current
constraints from oﬀ site neutrino radiation limits. If the required luminosities
are to be reached without unacceptable hazards, then signiﬁcant improvements
in muon emittance over the current base line values are needed. There is
however reason to believe such improvements are achievable, and machines
with a center of mass energy of 10 TeV and luminosities of 1035 cm−2s−1 and
above may be possible [9]. For energies below 3 TeV, for ﬁxed muon currents,
this radiation falls as the energy cubed, and it should be little problem for
machines with energies of 1.5 TeV or less.

Recent work in the collaboration has concentrated on the lowest energy ma-
chine (≈ 100 GeV), whose energy is taken to be representative of the possible
mass of a light Higgs particle. Such a machine would serve as a demonstration
of Muon Collider technology, a needed step before high energy machines can
be considered, and as a unique physics tool to make and study, if they exist,

PROTON DRIVER

π production rises approximately linearly with proton energy up to about 10
GeV after which it continues rising more slowly, but the requirement of very
short bunches sets an eﬀective minimum proton energy of about 16 GeV. The
baseline speciﬁcation used in Tb.2 is for a 16 GeV proton with a repetition
rate of 15 Hz, 1014 protons per cycle in 2 or 4 bunches (depending on the
collider energy), each with an rms bunch length of 1-2 ns. The total beam
power is 4 MW. A design worked out at FNAL [10] would involve: a) An
upgraded linac (0.4 → 1 GeV); b) higher energy booster (8 → 16 GeV) and
c) new pre-booster. Some parameters are given in Tb. 2.

Another study had been done at BNL [11] that, while it did not quite reach
the same beam power, involved far less upgrade: a) upgraded linac (0.2 → 0.6

GeV); b) increased AGS rep rate: 2.5 Hz.

In order to reduce the cost of the muon phase rotation section and for
minimizing the ﬁnal muon longitudinal phase space, it appears now that the
ﬁnal proton bunch length should be 1-2 ns.

An experiment [12] at the AGS has tested a method to generate such short
bunches by rapidly bringing the tune of the machine near transition and al-
lowing a strong phase rotation to occur. Bunches were shortened from 8 ns
rms to 2.2 ns with initial longitudinal phase space similar to that speciﬁed
in the above design. Shorter bunches are expected in later experiments with
better control.

Another experiment [13] has used variable inductors to reduce the longitu-

dinal space charge eﬀects.

Target and Pion Capture

π production is maximized by the use a well focused proton beam, small
diameter target and a high Z target material. Tungsten, platinum or lead
would be good, but the heating could not be easily removed and shock damage
could be a problem. The use of a rapidly ﬂowing liquid can solve the heating
problem, but the shock could damage the enclosure, if one is used. We are
thus considering the use of an open liquid jet. Such a jet has been tested [14]
using mercury, although this was never exposed to a beam, and the jet did not
move in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, as required in our case. Theoretical studies of
liquid metal ﬂow in magnetic ﬁelds are underway [15,16], and the possibilities
of using insulating liquids (e.g. PtO2, Re2O3) and slurries (e.g. Pt in water)
are being considered.

If the axis of the target is coincident with that of the solenoid ﬁeld, then
there is a relatively high probability that pions produced at the start of the
target will reenter, interact again later and be lost. The probability for such
interactions is reduced, and the overall production rate increased (by about
60 %) if the target and proton beam are set at an angle (10-15o) with respect
to the ﬁeld axis [17,18].

Three diﬀerent codes [19–21] have been used to estimate π yields and, de-
spite detailed diﬀerences between them, overall µ production was very similar.
In addition, the collaboration is involved in an AGS experiment [22] to mea-
sure the π yields. The production is peaked at a relatively low pion momentum
(≈ 200 MeV/c), but has a very wide distribution: ∆E
E rms ≈ 100 %. The pion
multiplicity, per 16 GeV proton, is about 2. At these low energies, the trans-
If a substantial fraction of
verse momenta are of the order of 200 MeV/c.
these pions are to be captured, a very wide band system is required. A 20 T
solenoid, 16 cm inside diameter is found to capture about half of all produced
pions, and with target eﬃciency included, about 0.6 pions per proton emerge
from the solenoid end [23]. Such a solenoid is well within the parameters of
existing magnets [24]. It would have a superconducting outsert, and an 8 MW
water cooled copper insert [25] (see Fig. 3).

After capture, the 20 T solenoid is matched [26] into a decay channel with

5 T ﬁelds and diameter of 30 cm.

Phase Rotation Linac

The pions, and the muons into which they decay, have an energy spread
with an rms value of approximately 100 %. It would be diﬃcult to handle
such a wide spread in any subsequent system. A linac is thus introduced along
the decay channel, with frequencies and phases chosen to deaccelerate the fast
particles and accelerate the slow ones; i.e. to phase rotate the muon bunch.
Tb.3 gives an example of parameters of such a linac. It is seen that the lowest

frequency is 30 MHz, a low but not impossible frequency for a conventional
structure.

Fig. 4 shows the energy vs. c t at the end of the decay and phase rotation
channel. A bunch is deﬁned with mean energy 150 MeV, rms bunch length
1.7 m, and rms momentum spread 20 % (95 %, ǫL = 3.2 eVs) in the Monte
Carlo study [6]. The number of muons per initial proton in this selected
bunch was 0.38, which can be compared with a value of 0.3 assumed in the
baseline parameters.

FIGURE 4. Energy vs. ct of µ’s at end of decay channel with phase rotation.

Use of Both Signs

Protons on the target produce pions of both signs, and a solenoid will cap-
ture both, but the required subsequent phase rotation rf systems will have
opposite eﬀects on each. The baseline solution is to use two proton bunches,
aim them at the same target one after the other, and adjust the rf phases such
as to act correctly on one sign of the ﬁrst bunch and on the other sign of the
second.

A second possibility would be to separate the charges into two channels,
and phase rotate them separately. However, the separation, probably using a
bent solenoid, is not simple and would not be fully eﬃcient. Whether a gain
in overall eﬃciency could be achieved is not yet known.

Polarization

Polarized Muon Production

In the center of mass of a decaying pion, the outgoing muon is fully polarized
(-1 for µ+ and +1 for µ−). In the lab system the polarization depends [27]
on the decay angle θd and initial pion energy. For pion kinetic energy larger

than the pion mass, the average is about 20 %, and if nothing else is done, the
polarization of the captured muons and phase rotated by the proposed system
is approximately this value.

If higher polarization is required, some selection of muons from forward pion
decays (cos θd → 1) is required. Fig. 4, above, showed the polarization of the
phase rotated muons. The polarization P> 1
3 is
marked by the symbols +, . and − respectively. If a selection is made on the
minimum energy of the muons, then greater polarization is obtained. The
tighter the cut, the higher the polarization, but the less the fraction Floss of
muons that are selected. Fig. 5 gives the results of a Monte Carlo study.

3 < P < 1

FIGURE 5. Polarization vs Floss of µ’s accepted.

If this selection is made on both beams, and if the proton bunch intensity is
maintained, then naturally the muon bunch is reduced by the factor Floss and
the luminosity would fall by F 2
loss. But if, instead, proton bunches are merged
so as to obtain half as many bunches with twice the intensity, then the muon
bunch intensity is maintained and the luminosity (and repetition rate) falls
only as Floss.

One also notes that the luminosity could be maintained at the full unpolar-
ized value if the proton source intensity could be increased. Such an increase in
proton source intensity in the unpolarized case would be impractical because
of the resultant excessive high energy muon beam power, but this restriction

does not apply if the increase is used to oﬀset losses in generating polarization.

Polarization Preservation

A paper [28] has discussed the preservation of muon polarization in some
detail. During the ionization cooling process the muons lose energy in material
and have a spin ﬂip probability P,

approximately 3 GeV and the typical energy is 150 MeV, so the integrated
spin ﬂip probability is close to 10 %. The change in polarization ∆P
P is twice
the spin ﬂip probability, so the reduction in polarization is approximately
20 %. This loss is included in Fig. 5.

During circulation in any ring, the muon spins, if initially longitudinal,
will precess by (g-2)/2 γ turns per revolution; where (g-2)/2 is 1.166 10−3.
A given energy spread ∆γ
γ will introduce variations in these precessions and
cause dilution of the polarization. But if the particles remain in the ring for an
exact integer number of synchrotron oscillations, then their individual average
γ’s will be the same and no dilution will occur.

In the collider, bending can be performed with the spin orientation in the
vertical direction, and the spin rotated into the longitudinal direction only
for the interaction region. The design of such spin rotators appears relatively
straightforward, but long. This might be a preferred solution at high energies
but is not practical for instance, in the 100 GeV machine. An alternative is to
use such a small energy spread, as in the Higgs factory, that though the polar-
ization vector precesses, the beam polarization does not become signiﬁcantly
diluted.

COOLING

For a collider, the phase-space volume must be reduced within a time of
the order of the µ lifetime. Cooling by synchrotron radiation, conventional
stochastic cooling and conventional electron cooling are all too slow. Optical
stochastic cooling [29], electron cooling in a plasma discharge [30] and cooling
in a crystal lattice [31] are being studied, but appear diﬃcult.
Ionization
cooling [32] of muons seems relatively straightforward.

Ionization Cooling Theory

In ionization cooling, the beam loses both transverse and longitudinal mo-
mentum as it passes through a material medium. Subsequently, the longitudi-
nal momentum can be restored by coherent reacceleration, leaving a net loss
of transverse momentum.

The approximate equation for transverse cooling (with energies in GeV) is:

where ǫn is the normalized emittance, β⊥ is the betatron function at the
absorber, dEµ/ds is the energy loss, and LR is the radiation length of the
material. The ﬁrst term in this equation is the coherent cooling term, and
the second is the heating due to multiple scattering. This heating term is
minimized if β⊥ is small (strong-focusing) and LR is large (a low-Z absorber).

where the ﬁrst term is the cooling (or heating) due to energy loss, and the
second term is the heating due to straggling.

Energy spread can be reduced by artiﬁcially increasing d(dEµ/ds)

by placing
a transverse variation in absorber density or thickness at a location where
position is energy dependent, i.e. where there is dispersion. The use of such
wedges can reduce energy spread, but it simultaneously increases transverse
emittance in the direction of the dispersion. Six dimensional phase space is
not reduced.

dEµ

Cooling Components

We require a reduction of the normalized transverse emittance by almost
three orders of magnitude (from 1×10−2 to 5×10−5 m-rad), and a reduction of
the longitudinal emittance by one order of magnitude. This cooling is obtained
in a series of cooling stages. In general, each stage consists of two components:

1. a material in a strong focusing (lowβ⊥) environment alternated with linac
accelerators. These components will cool the transverse phase space.

2. a lattice that generates dispersion, with absorbing material wedges intro-

duced to interchange longitudinal and transverse emittance.

Simulations have been performed on examples of each component using
the program ICOOL [33] which includes Vavilov distributions (with Landau
and Gaussian limits) for dE/dx, and Moliere scattering distributions (with
Rutherford limit). The only eﬀects which are not yet included are space-
charge and wake-ﬁeld eﬀects. Analytic vacuum calculations indicate that these
eﬀects should be signiﬁcant, but not overwhelming. A correct simulation must
be done before we are assured that no real problems exist.

Transverse Cooling

The baseline solution for the ﬁrst component involves the use of liquid hy-
drogen absorbers in strong solenoid focusing ﬁelds, interleaved with short linac
sections. The solenoidal ﬁelds in succesive absorbers must be reversed to avoid
build up of the canonical angular momentum. Fig. 6 shows the cross section
of one cell of such a system. The top plot in Fig. 7 shows the reduction of
transverse emittance in 10 such cells (20 m); the middle one shows the increase
in longitudinal emittance induced by straggling and the adverse dependence
of dE/dx with energy; while the bottom one shows the overall reduction in
6-dimensional emittance. This simulation has been conﬁrmed, with minor
diﬀerences by the codes double precision GEANT [34] and PARMELA [35].

Using 30 T solenoids at the end of a cooling sequence can attain a transverse
emittance of 190 mm mrad and a six dimensional emittance of 30 × 10−12 m3
(cf.280 mm mrad and 170×10−12 m3, respectively required for a Higgs factory).
Other solutions, e.g. rapidly alternating solenoids and LiH absorbers [36]
and current carrying Li rods have been and will continue to be studied, but
do not appear to be required to meet the baseline parameters (see below).

Linac

The linacs used in the above simulations has a frequency of 805 MHz and
required an accelerating gradient (peak phase) of 24 MV/m. The current
designs use cavities separated by thin Be foils, 2π
4 phase advanced per
cavity, and powered in 3 of 4 separate interleaved side-coupled standing-wave
systems [37,38].
In order to reduce power source requirements the cavities
may be operated at liquid nitrogen temperatures.

3 or 2π

Longitudinal-Transverse Exchange

The exchange of longitudinal and transverse emittance requires dispersion
in a large acceptance channel. One way of achieving this is in a bent solenoid.
Fig. 8 shows transverse positions vs.their momenta: a) before the bend, b)
after the bend, and c) after hydrogen wedges. The rms momentum spread in

FIGURE 6. The cross section of one cell of an alternating solenoid cooling system

this example is reduced from 8 MeV/c to 4.6 MeV/c with an accompanying
approximate equivalent increase in the x-y emittance.

Emittance exchange in solid wedges in the presence of ideal dispersion has
also been simulated using SIMUCOOL [39]. Dispersion generation by weak
focussing spectrometers [40] and dipoles with solenoids [41] are also studied.

Cooling System

The required total 6 dimensional cooling is about 106. Since a single stage,
as illustrated above, gives a factor of 2 reduction, about 20 such stages are
required. The total length of the system would be of the order of 500 m, and
the total acceleration would be of the order of 6 GeV. The fraction of muons
remaining at the end of the cooling system is estimated to be ≈ 60%.

In a few of the later stages, current carrying lithium rods might replace item
(1) above. In this case the rod serves simultaneously to maintain the low β⊥,
and attenuate the beam momenta. Similar lithium rods, with surface ﬁelds of
10 T , were developed at Novosibirsk (BINP) and have been used as focusing
elements at FNAL and CERN [42,43]. Cooling in beam recirculators could
lead to reduction of costs of the cooling section [40].

ACCELERATION

Following cooling and initial bunch compression, the beams must be rapidly
accelerated. A sequence of linacs would work, but would be expensive, some
form of circulating acceleration is preferred. At lower energies, the acceleration

FIGURE 7. Emittance vs. length in 10 alternating solenoid cells; TOP: transverse emit-
tance; MIDDLE: longitudinal emittance; and BOTTOM: 6-dimensional emittance

time is so short that any form of magnet ramping is probably impractical. The
conservative option is to use a sequence of recirculating accelerators (similar
to that used at TJNL), but ﬁxed frequency alternating gradient acceleration
(FFAG) is also being studied [44]. At higher energies, it is probably more eco-
nomical to use fast rise time pulsed magnets in more conventional synchrotrons
[45].

Scenarios

Tbs. 4 and 5 give an example of possible sequences of accelerators for a 100
GeV Higgs Factory and a 3 TeV collider. In both cases, following initial linacs,
recirculating accelerators are used. Designs [46] have been made of multiple
aperture superconducting magnets for use in recirculating acceleration. The
use of such magnets was not assumed in the scenarios, but they would reduce

FIGURE 8. Transverse trajectory positions vs.their momenta: a) before the bend, b)
after the bend, and c) after hydrogen wedges.

the diameter of the recirculating accelerator ring and lower particle loss from
decay.

In the high energy case, the ﬁnal three stages use pulsed magnet syn-
chrotrons. If only pulsed magnets were used the power consumed by a ring
would be high and its circumference large, but a hybrid ring with alternating
pulsed warm magnets and ﬁxed superconducting magnets appears practical.
In the example, the last two such rings are located in the same tunnel with
diﬀering ratios of pulsed to ﬁxed magnets. The ﬁxed magnets are supercon-
ducting at 8 T; the pulse d magnets are warm with ﬁelds that swing from
- 2 T to + 2 T.

In both cases, except for the earliest stages, superconducting rf is employed.
The reason for this, in the earlier stage, is that the instantaneous acceleration
power requirement is very high, and the use of superconducting cavities allows
a longer rf ﬁll time and a reduced rf power source requirement. For the higher
energy accelerators the use of superconducting cavities is dictated by the need
to achieve high wall to beam eﬃciency.

A study [47] tracked particles through a similar sequence of recirculating
accelerators and found a dilution of longitudinal phase space of the order of
10% and negligible particle loss.

COLLIDER STORAGE RING

After acceleration, the µ+ and µ− bunches are injected into a separate stor-
age ring. The highest possible average bending ﬁeld is desirable, to maximize
the number of revolutions before decay, and thus maximize the luminosity.
Collisions would occur in one, or perhaps two, low-β∗ interaction areas. Pa-
rameters of the rings were given earlier in Tb. 1.

Lattice Design

In order to maintain the required short bunches, without excessive rf, ap-
proximately isochronous Flexible Momentum Compaction lattices [48] would
be used.

In the high energy cases, the required betas at the intersection point are very
small (e.g. β∗ = 3 mm for 4 TeV), and the quadrupoles needed to generate
them are large (20-30 cm diameter). At 100 GeV, the betas are not so small
and the quadrupoles are more conventional, but in both cases it has been
found that local chromatic correction is essential [49].

Preliminary lattices have been designed for both 4 TeV and 0.5 TeV ma-
chines [50], and several designs now exist for the 100 GeV case. Fig. 9 gives
the dynamic aperture of one such lattice [51] for the required 1000 turns.

Collimation schemes have been designed [52] for colliders at both high and
low energies. At low energies, as in the Higgs Factory, tungsten collimators
have been shown to be eﬀective. At higher energies, the muons are scattered,
but not stopped, by such collimators. For this case it has been shown that
electrostatic septa followed by sweeping magnets could eﬀectively extract the
tail muons. Lattices [50] have been designed incorporating these systems.

Instabilities

The studies [53,54] have considered beam emittance growth due to beam-
beam tune shift, and both, althought some assumptions were made, predict
negligible eﬀects in 1000 tunes at the values shown in Tb. 1.

A study [55] has examined the resistive wall impedance longitudinal instabil-
ities in rings at several energies. At the higher energies and larger momentum
spreads, solutions were found with small but ﬁnite momentum compaction,
and moderate rf. For the special case of the Higgs Factory, with its very low
momentum spread, a solution was found with no synchrotron motion, but rf
provided to correct the ﬁrst order impedance generated momentum spread.
The remaining oﬀ momentum tails, that would not aﬀect the luminosity, but
which might generate background, could be removed by a higher harmonic rf
correction.

Given the very slow, or nonexistent synchrotron oscillations, the transverse
beam breakup instability is signiﬁcant. But this instability can be stabilized
using rf quadrupole [56] induced BNS damping. For instance, in the 3 TeV
case, to stabilize the resistive wall instability, the required tune spread, cal-
culated [57] using the two particle model approximation, for a 1 cm radius
aluminum pipe, is only 1.58 × 10−4.

However, this application of the BNS damping to a quasi-isochronous ring,
and other head-tail instabilities due to the chromaticities ξ and η1, needs more
careful study.

Bending Magnet Design

FIGURE 10. Power penetrating tungsten shields vs. their thickness for, a) a 4 TeV, and
b) a 100 GeV, Collider.

The magnet design is complicated by the fact that the µ’s decay within
the rings (µ− → e−νeνµ), producing electrons whose mean energy is approxi-
mately 0.35 that of the muons. With no shielding, the average power deposited
per unit length would be about 2 kW/m in the 4 TeV machine, and 300 W/m
in the 100 GeV Higgs factory. Fig. 10 shows the power penetrating tungsten
shields of diﬀerent thickness. One sees that 3 cm in the low energy case, or
6 cm at high energy would reduce the power to below 10 W/m which can
reasonably be taken by superconducting magnets.

The quadrupoles could use warm iron poles placed as close to the beam as
practical. The coils could then be either superconducting or warm, placed at
a greater distance from the beam and shielded from it by the poles.

NEUTRINO RADIATION

Bruce King [60] has shown that the surface radiation dose DB(Sv) in a
time t(s),
in the plane of a bending magnet of ﬁeld B(T), in a circular
collider with beam energy E(T eV ), average bending ﬁeld < B(T ) >, at a

depth d(m) (assuming a spherical earth), with muon current (of each sign) of
I(muons/sec/sign) is given by:

and that the dose DS at a location on the surface, in line with a high beta
straight section of length ℓ is:

DB ≈ 4.4 10−24 Iµ E3 t

< B >
B

t

DS ≈ 6.7 10−24 Iµ E3 t

ℓ < B > t

d

d

The ﬁrst formula has been conﬁrmed by a Monte Carlo simulation using the
MARS code [61]. In all cases it is assumed that the average divergence angles
satisfy the condition: σθ << 1
γ . This condition is not satisﬁed in the straight
sections approaching the IP, and these regions, despite their length, do not
contribute a signiﬁcant dose.

For the 3 TeV parameters given in Tb. 1 (muon currents I = 6×1020 µ−/yr,
< B >= 6 T, B = 10 T, and taking the federal limit on oﬀ site radiation
Dose/year, DF ed to be 1 mSv/year (100 mrem/year), then the dose DB per
year (deﬁned as 107 s), in the plane of a bending dipole is:

DB = 1.07 10−5 (Sv) ≈ 1% DF ed

and for a straight section of length 0.6 m is:

DB = 9.7 10−5 (Sv) ≈ 10% DF ed

which may be taken to be a reasonable limit.

Special care will be required in the lattice design to assure that no ﬁeld free
region longer than this is present. But it may be noted that the presence of
a ﬁeld of even 1 T over any length, is enough to reduce the dose to the 10 %
Federal limit standard. For machines above 3 TeV, the muon current would
probably have to be reduced.

For lower energy machines, the requirements get rapidly easier: a 0.5 TeV
at 500 m depth could have 130 m straight sections, or if at 100 m depth 25
m lengths, for the same surface dose. For a 100 GeV machine the doses are
negligible.

DETECTOR BACKGROUND

There will be backgrounds in the detector from the decay of muons in the
ring and approaching the IP. A recent study [58] of electromagnetic, hadronic
and muon components of the background has been done using the GEANT
codes [59]. This study

• followed shower neutrons and photons down to 40 keV and electrons to

25 KeV.

• Used a tungsten shield over the beam, extending in to within 14 cm of
the intersection point, and extending outward to an angle of 20 degrees
from the axis.

• Inside this shield, between its smallest aperture 1 m from the IP, and its
tip, the inner surface is shaped into a series of rising collimating steps and
slopes, designed so that, the detector could not see any surface directly
illuminated by the initial decay electrons, whether seen in the forward or
backward (albedo) directions.

• From the aperture point of minimum to a few meters (2.5 m for Higgs
Factory) upstream, the inside forms another series of stepped collimators
placed at ± 4 σθ0 (where σθ0 is the rms divergence of the beam).

• Further upstream, prior to the ﬁrst quadrupole (from 2.5 to 4 m in the
Higgs case) an 8 T dipole, with collimators inside, is used to sweep decay
electrons before the ﬁnal collimation.

Tb. 6 gives the hit density for the Higgs factory from the various sources
and the occupancy of pixels of the given sizes. In all cases the numbers are
given per bunch crossing. The hit density for the higher energy machines are
found to be somewhat lower than these, due to the small decay angles of the
electrons. The radiation damage by the neutrons on a silicon detector has also
been estimated. In the Higgs case, at 5 cm from the vertex, the number of hits
from neutrons above 100 KeV is found to be 1.8 1013 per year (107 s). This is
an order of magnitude less than that expected at the LHC. The damages for
silicon detectors in the higher energy machines are of the same order.

This study also found a signiﬁcant ﬂux of muons, with quite high energies,
from µ pair production in electromagnetic showers (Bethe Heitler). Their most
serious eﬀect appears to arise when they make deeply inelastic interactions
and deposit spikes of energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.
This is not serious in the Higgs case, when the ﬂuxes and cross sections are low,

but at higher energies timing and/or longitudinal calorimeter segmentation
appears necessary to identify and remove the problem.

An ealier study using the code MARS [62], using less sophisticated shielding,

gave results qualitatively in agreement with those from Geant [58].

CONCLUSION

Motive

• Because they can be circular, muon colliders appear to be far smaller

than hadron or e+e−machines of similar eﬀective energy.

• It is thus hoped that muon colliders could have a lower cost per TeV than

other options.

• Their smaller size would allow machines up to 3 TeV eﬀective energy
(roughly equivalent to a 30 TeV hadron machine) to ﬁt on existing lab-
oratory sites.

• The low synchrotron and beamstrahlung radiation with muons could al-

low energy spreads as small as 0.003 % (3 x 10−5).

• By measuring g-2 of the muon it should be possible to determine the

energy to even greater precision.

• The above, plus the large cross section for s-channel production, could
make a muon collider into a precision tool to study Higgs particles and
their decays.

Progress

• The theory of operation of all components of a muon collider are now

well understood.

• Simulations of examples of all components of a baseline design have now
been performed. The simulated performances of many of these com-
ponents has exceeded the baseline speciﬁcations. All known eﬀects have
been included except space-charge in the cooling, whose eﬀect, calculated
analytically, appears not to be too large.

Needed

• More detailed simulations of all components, including space-charge in

the cooling.

• Complete scenarios of the cooling stages and acceleration.

• An experimental study of the target.

• The construction and test of one or more of the cooling stages.

• Technical development of components: a large high ﬁeld solenoid for
capture, low frequency rf linacs, multi-beam or pulsed magnets for ac-
celeration, warm bore shielded high ﬁeld dipoles for the collider, muon
collimators and background shields, etc.. But none of these components
can be described as exotic, and their speciﬁcations are not beyond what
has been demonstrated.

Abstract

The e−e− running mode is one of the interesting physics
options at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The lu-
minosity for e−e− collisions is reduced by the beam-beam
effects. The resulting beamstrahlung energy loss and beam-
beam deﬂection angles as function of the vertical transverse
offset are different compared to the e+e− collisions. In this
paper, the dependence of these observables with the offset
for different beam sizes has been analyzed to optimize per-
formances for the e−e− mode, taking into account the re-
quirements of the beam-beam deﬂection based intra-train
feedback system. A ﬁrst study of the implications for the
ﬁnal focus and extraction line optics is also presented for
the cases of the 20 mrad and 2 mrad ILC base line crossing
angle geometries.

BEAM-BEAM EFFECTS

At the Interaction Point (IP) of the ILC, beam-beam
effects due to the strong electromagnetic ﬁelds that the
bunches experience during collisions cause a mutual focus-
ing, called pinch effect, which enhances the luminosity in
the case of e+e− collisions. The opposite is true for e−e−
collisions. In this case the luminosity is reduced by mutual
defocusing, or anti-pinching and is only about 20% of the
e+e− one (see Fig. 1). Moreover this repulsion between
the bunches causes the luminosity to drop with a vertical
offset at the IP much more rapidly for the e−e− case than
for e+e− . Another effect of this strong repulsive electro-
magnetic ﬁeld is the much steeper beam-beam deﬂection

curve (see Fig. 2). Since the fast intra-train feedback sys-
tem used to maintain the beams in collision at the IP [1]
exploits these deﬂections as its main signal and because of
the higher sensitivity to the vertical offsets, it is important
to compare average performances for e−e− and e+e− for
a set of representative values of initial beam offsets and
bunch-to- bunch jitter.

shown include a 100 nm initial offset.

An additional set of parameters is also being investigated
with only half of the bunch charge, while keeping the same
number of bunches per train. It has a smaller peak lumi-
nosity (see Table 1) and similar sensitivity to IP offsets as
the e−e− nominal case. Such a parameter set could be im-
portant for early ILC operation and ﬂexibility.

FEEDBACK SIMULATION

A simpliﬁed simulation of the feedback has been car-
ried out using parametrized information from the last bunch
crossing with a single proportional factor to relate the mea-
sured deﬂection angle of the outgoing beam to the correc-
tion of the offset at the IP [2]. At frequencies of a few Hz
corresponding to the ILC train repetition rate, offsets of or-
der of hundreds of nm are predicted (see e.g. [3]). In addi-
tion bunch-to-bunch jitter of a fraction of the beam size can
be expected. The simulation has been done for different as-
sumptions on the initial train offset and bunch-to-bunch jit-
ter, and including a 10% error on the correction to represent
the measured uncertainties. The factor relating the correc-
tion to the measured deﬂection angle was optimized, inde-
pendently for e+e− and e−e− beam parameters, to max-
imize the speed of the correction without amplifying the
bunch-to-bunch jitter by over-correcting. Nominal beam
parameters [5] were used at √s = 500 GeV. The average
luminosity loss over a train was found to be almost inde-
pendent of the offset at the beginning of the pulse for the
range considered (up to 500 nm). The e−e− luminosity
loss was however found to be a factor 2 greater compared
to e+e− for the same assumption on the jitter.This is due
to the greater sensitivity to the vertical offset. The ability
to decrease this sensitivity with alternative beam parame-
ters could be important if jitter conditions are worse than
expected, e.g. during early ILC operation.

With this purpose, sets of alternative beam parameters
with smaller disruption have been derived by decreasing
the bunch length and varying the transverse beam sizes, in
order to maximize the luminosity while limiting the beam-
strahlung energy loss to 5% (see Table 1). These alternative
parameters have increased luminosity, and some of them
smaller sensitivity to the IP offset, compared to those ob-
tained for the nominal case for e−e− . The average train

CROSSING-ANGLE GEOMETRY

Final focus

The optics of the Final Focus (FF) (corresponding to the
20 mrad crossing-angle geometry) has been reﬁtted to ob-
tain the new β-functions at the IP for the alternative beam
parameters in Table 1. Only the quadrupoles upstream of
the chromatic correction section and the sextupoles were
readjusted. This allows to maintain the geometry and over-
all optimization of high order effects. The β-functions and
the dispersion for the parameter set 2 in Table 1 are shown
in Fig. 4.

OPTICS STUDIES FOR THE 2 mrad
CROSSING-ANGLE GEOMETRY

In the 2 mrad crossing-angle geometry the spent
beam is transported off-axis through the last defocussing
quadrupole of the ﬁnal focus. The kick produced by this
quadrupole is used to extract the spent beam. This scheme
doesn’t work for the e−e− option unless one can reverse
the signs of the focusing and defocusing ﬁnal doublet
quadrupoles (and sextupoles), while keeping at least the
strength of the last quadrupole to maintain the kick needed
for extraction. A ﬁrst attempt in this direction [9] indicated
that this was feasible, but large βy-value had to be used at
the IP to limit the vertical beam size in the ﬁnal doublet,
which is important to keep reasonable collimation depth.
This resulted however in about a factor 2 lower peak lumi-

Figure 4: Optics solution for the parameter set 2, for the 20
mrad crossing-angle geometry.

The optical bandwidth for the different sets of parame-
ters has been studied, considering beams with a uniform
ﬂat momentum distribution with an energy spread of 0.1%.
The distribution of particles at the entrance of the FF, was
created with PLACET [6] for different average momentum
offsets. The beam was then tracked through the FF with
MAD8 [7] and used as input for GUINEA-PIG to com-
pute the luminosity. The results (see Fig. 5) show similar
off-momentum behavior for all parameter sets, with the al-
ternative sets having better peak performance.

Extraction line

The effective parameters corresponding to the disrupted
beam have been computed along the extraction line for the
different beam parameter sets in Table 1 (see Fig. 6), and
for the different parameters sets suggested for e+e− in [5].
The largest values found for the β-functions in the e−e−
and e+e− cases were comparable. The tracking of the dis-
rupted beams has been simulated with BDSIM [8] and the
power losses along the line have been computed. For the
parameter set 2 the losses are smaller than for the high lu-
minosity parameters for e+e− (see Fig. 7).

nosity. Improvements with half the bunch length are also
being investigated, with for example β∗
x/y = 10/3 mm. In
this case, more acceptable overall performance is expected.

CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

For the 20 mrad crossing-angle geometry, beam param-
eters can be obtained for the e−e− option by decreasing
the bunch length, with improved peak luminosity, smaller
sensitivity to IP offsets, and similar beam losses in the ex-
traction line as those found for e+e− . For the 2 mrad
crossing-angle, it is necessary to go to larger vertical beam
sizes at the IP, which decreases the luminosity. With half of
the bunch length and optimizing the transverse beam sizes
taking into account collimation requirements, a ﬁrst study
indicates that some of this reduction can be recovered. In
the near future, these problems will be studied to further
characterize the e−e− option at the ILC.

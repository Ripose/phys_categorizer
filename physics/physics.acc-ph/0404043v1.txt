Some high-energy experiments have suﬀered from synchrotron-radiation background. As a mea-
sure, we have developed a new calculation method of synchrotron radiation based on a real beam
orbit, aiming at quantitative estimations and the construction of a possible alarm system for the
background. An explanation and a demonstration of our method are given.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A. Fitting procedure

At the initial stage of the KEK B-factory (KEKB) ex-
periment [1], synchrotron radiation (SR) from the cir-
culating 8-GeV electron beam caused serious damage to
the Belle silicon vertex detector (SVD) [2], which was
located close to the interaction point (IP). Some of the
preampliﬁers mounted on the inner-most SVD layer died
in about ten days just after start of the gain drop. Other
high-energy experiments have also suﬀered from SR back-
ground.

We have developed a new method to calculate SR
wattages based on a real beam orbit, aiming at quan-
titative estimations and the construction of a possible
alarm system for SR background. Here, the real orbit is
obtained by ﬁtting measurements of beam-position mon-
itors (BPMs). In the following sections, our method is
explained together with some illustrations using the 8-
GeV electron beams of KEKB High Energy Ring (HER).
Finally, we present a simulation of the orbit and the gain
drop at the time of the SVD gain-drop accident as a
bench mark.

Orbit ﬁtting is performed based on the optics, ﬁeld
strengths of the magnets, and BPM measurements. We
require minimization of χ2, deﬁned as

χ2 =

where X (BPM)
) indicates the horizontal (vertical)
beam position measured with BPM:j, X (orbit)
(Y (orbit)
)
the horizontal (vertical) position of the calculated orbit
at BPM:j, and σj
is the BPM:j resolution. There are
four ﬂoating parameters, which are the orbit positions at
the entrance and exit of the relevant accelerator section:
X (in), Y (in), X (out), Y (out). Minimization of χ2 is performed
using the computer program MINUIT [4, 5]. An example of
the orbit-ﬁtting results for KEKB HER is shown in Fig. 1.
Here, we deﬁne the vertical and horizontal χ2 to estimate the
goodness of the ﬁt for each direction separately:

II. ORBIT CALCULATION

which lead to the following relations:

Beam orbits are calculated by a linear approximation
using transfer matrices, which are shown in Appendix A.
For numerical calculations, we coded a dedicated com-
puter program in Fortran, where the correctness of the
orbit calculation was checked by comparing with a cal-
culation using SAD [3]. Furthermore, we conﬁrmed that
there was no signiﬁcant eﬀect from round-oﬀ errors by
comparing the results of double- and quadruple-precision
calculations.

where Ndf (X) (Ndf (Y )) indicates the number of degrees of
freedom related to the horizontal (vertical) direction, and
In the example
Ndf for both: Ndf = Ndf (X) + Ndf (Y ).
shown in Fig. 1, the goodness of the ﬁt is χ2
X /Ndf (X) = 10.5
and χ2
Y /Ndf (Y ) = 40.3 for a conservative BPM resolution of
100 µm. As is often the case, χ2 is too large, and also the orbit
at the IP is unrealistically deﬂected in the negative direction
by about 3 mm. This is due to the fact that the absolute po-
sitions of magnets and BPMs are not known suﬃciently well,
leading to a need for the oﬀset corrections.

In order to obtain the oﬀset sizes (∆X (QUAD)

), we perform a global ﬁtting for dif-
j
ferent orbits within a time period in which magnets are not
expected to have moved.
In case of KEKB, we make vari-
ous measurements in machine studies using six diﬀerent or-
bits in each of the horizontal and vertical directions, which
are produced by making a small kick at one of the six steer-
ing magnets. We ﬁt those six orbits simultaneously with not
only the usual ﬂoating parameters (X (in)
, Y (out)
i
(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)), but also the oﬀsets in formula (6). We
furthermore introduce an additional ﬂoating parameter: the
correction factor of the ﬁeld strength of the bending magnet
(BEND), a, which is deﬁned as θcorr = (1 + a)
θorg, where
θorg and θcorr are the kick angles before and after the correc-
tion, respectively. The BPM and QUAD oﬀsets as well as the
correction factors of the BENDs are common among the six
orbits. It is clear that the simple ﬁtting procedure leads to
failure because there are too many ﬂoating parameters (more
than one hundred in our example).

(vertical) ﬁtted orbit together with the BPM measurements.
χ2
X /Ndf (X) = 3.6 and χ2
Y /Ndf (Y ) = 0.6.

Therefore, we ﬁrst categorize the oﬀset and correction-
factor parameters to be ﬂoating into three sets: the BPM-
related, QUAD-related, and BEND-related ones. We choose
zero or one parameter to be ﬂoating in each category, and the
other parameters are ﬁxed at zero. Then, a global ﬁtting is
performed for the combination of the choice. We try all of the
possible combinations (about 10 million in our example), and
a large number of results are ﬁltered, requiring the following
criteria:

•

• |

deﬁnite Hessian matrix,

< 10 mm,

|

|

|

•

the vertical and horizontal displacements of the ﬁtted
orbit at the IP with respect to the nominal IP are within
1 mm.

• |

|

Then, the best (lowest) χ2 sample is selected as the ﬁnal one.
Figure 2 shows the ﬁtted orbit after the oﬀset corrections.
With the corrections, the χ2 is small, and the orbit passes
close to the BPM measurements and the nominal IP. Choosing
two oﬀsets to be ﬂoating in each category, we obtained almost
the same results.

This method is to ﬁnd a solution with a minimum modiﬁ-

cation within the scope of the numerical approach.

where the s axis is taken to be along the beam orbit, and
ρ(s) is the radius of curvature at s. A wattage distribution in
a plane can be obtained by taking the mapping of (s, ψ)
→
(X, Y ), where (X, Y ) is a point of intersection of the plane
and the line with the angle ψ with respect to the tangent of
the orbit at s. Integration on s and ψ corresponds to surface
integration of the Poynting vector in the plane. We perform
numerical integrations of formula (8) using the Monte-Carlo
(MC) integration program BASES [7].

The implementation of the wattage calculation in our pro-
gram was checked by comparing with the numerical calcula-
tion using SAD [8]. In the SAD calculation, the exact formula
in electrodynamics [9] is used.

It is important to consider any beam-size eﬀects in the SR
simulation, especially for the SR from QUADs. The eﬀects
are included by adding four additional integration variables
(X, X ′, Y, Y ′), which indicate a phase-space point of the orbit
at the IP. MC integration is performed together with the fol-
lowing Gaussian weight function to describe the beam proﬁle:

IV. BENCH-MARK TEST

In order to demonstrate the validity of our method, we
adopt the SVD gain-drop accident as a bench mark. For
radiation-dose calculations, we made a detector simulation
based on EGS4 [10], which was improved for low-energy pho-
tons [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In this detector simulation, the ex-
act geometry and materials of the relevant SVD components
have been installed according to engineering drawings. SR
photons, generated with the general-purpose event generator
SPRING [7], are fed into the detector simulation, and energy
deposits in the SVD are calculated. Photons are simulated
down to 1 keV, and electrons to 20-keV kinematic energy. In

This simulation

Measurement

order to transfer the radiation dose into the gain drop, we use
the result on the irradiation test to investigate the radiation
hardness of the SVD preampliﬁers [16].

We make two diﬀerent sets of calculations for a more care-
ful demonstration. One of them is on the radiation dose be-
fore starting the gain drop (period I), and the other is after
the start (period II), as shown in Fig. 5. During each of the
two periods, the beam orbit was almost unchanged. Table I
gives the results of a radiation-dose calculation for period
I. Obtaining information on the time of the period (4641
minutes), and on the average beam current (4.6 mA), the
gain drop is estimated to be around or less than 1 %,
which is consistent with the measurements (. 1 %). Af-
ter starting the gain drop, the estimated doses are much
higher in period II than those in period I, as shown in Ta-
ble II, where the time of the period is 8071 minutes, and
the average beam current is 6.7 mA. What changed sig-
niﬁcantly are the kick angle of the vertical BEND, which
made a dominant contribution to the radiation dose in
period II, and the orbit around the BEND, as shown
in Fig. 6. The bending angle changed from 0.53 mrad
with 1.7-keV critical energy (Ecrit) to 0.66 mrad with
Ecrit = 2.2 keV in the same direction. Figure 7 shows
a comparison between the estimated and measured gain-
drop values. We have obtained good agreements not only
on the absolute size, but also for the azimuthal distribu-
tion.

obtained by ﬁtting BPM measurements. SR wattages are
calculated based on the ﬁtted orbit with the MC integra-
tion of the analytical formula. We have coded a ded-
icated computer program, where the correctness of the
orbit and wattage calculations in our program has been
conﬁrmed by comparing with the results using SAD. Fi-
nally, we have successfully reproduced the SVD gain-drop
accident quantitatively, so that the practicability of our
method has been established.

This method can be applied to the construction of an
online alarm system for SR background, leading to prior
notice for detector damage and possibly more ﬂexibility
in accelerator operation.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
PROSPECTS

APPENDIX A: TRANSFER MATRICES

We have developed a new method to calculate SR
wattages, or radiation doses, based on a real beam or-
bit with reasonable oﬀset corrections. Here, the orbit is

The exact forms of the transfer matrices used in the
orbit calculation are shown in this appendix. Here, L
indicates the eﬀective length of the component. k is de-
ﬁned as k =
(B0/b)/(Bρ), where B0 is the magnetic

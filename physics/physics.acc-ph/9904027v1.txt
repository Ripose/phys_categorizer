Spectroscopy through the change of undulator parameters
in dipole regime

M.L. Schinkeev

Tomsk Polytechnic University

Abstract

In this work a method of spectroscopy without monochromators for the un-
dulator radiation (UR) source is proposed. This method is based of changing
the magnetic ﬁeld in the undulator. Diﬀerent variations of ﬁeld modulations and
corresponding object reaction for the case of a dipole regime of UR exitation
were considered. The results of a numerical experiment are shown and possi-
bilites of this method for an undulator consisting of two blocks and rearranging
by changing the distance between the blocks were estimated.

1. Introduction

In recent works [1-3] it has been proposed to use undulator radiation for
spectroscopy without monochromators. According to these proposals the UR
without an intermediate converter falls on the spectroscopical object, where the
spectral density of the UR ﬂux is multiplied with the spectral sensitivity of the
detector on every wavelength λ and then summed. This summation gives an
object reaction on the UR ﬂux integrally over all wavelengths. Considering the
UR spectrum can be relativistically changed (by changing the particles energy
or the undulator ﬁeld), the reaction of the object on the rearranged source of
radiation can be deﬁned as an integral Fredgolm equation of the I kind:

I(P ) =

K(P, λ)A(λ)dλ,

(1)

where I(P ) is the object reaction on the UR ﬂux, K(P, λ) is the equation kernel
(1) - spectral density of the radiation ﬂux, A(λ) is the spectral function of the
radiacion acceptor, and P is the rearranging parameter. The determination of
the object function A(λ) by the measured reaction I(P ) reduces to the solution
of the integral equation with the known kernel K(P, λ).

As was shown in Ref. [2], the simplest way to solve this equation is to use the
energy of the accelerated particles as a rearranging parameter. This method was

already used in Refs. [2,3]. However, the active change of the particle energy is
eﬀectively possible only for accelerators and rather problematic by big storage
rings, to which the majority of users are now oriented. Spectroscopy without
monochromators attract interest, because in this case the spectral properties of
the source could be changed not by the particle energy, but by changing the
undulator ﬁeld.

2. Basic relations

Singe spectroscopy without monochromators produces no loss in intensity
of the source on an intermediate converter, it is suitable to use an undulator
with the dipole regime of UR exitation for the dipole parameter k2 ≪ 1. By
this means, spectroscopy without monochromators is conﬁned to changes in the
UR ﬁeld structure (not taking into consideration changes of k2), but it gives,
nowever, a simler possibility for the numerical realization of the algorithm of
the solution of Eq. (1). The spectral density of the photon ﬂux in an arbirary
spectral interval d¯ω = dω/ω for a radiating charge in the dipole approximation,
according to Refs[2,3], can by written as:

where J is the magnitude of the current of the accelerated charge in the storage
ring, α is the ﬁne structure constant, e is the electron charge, m is the electron
mass, µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum, η = (λ0/(2λγ2))(1 + k2)
is the number of the UR harmonic; γ is the Lorentz factor, λ0 is the period
length of the undulator magnetic ﬁeld, and H 2(ν) is the square modulus of the
Fourier-structure of the UR magnetic ﬁeld.

As was shown in Ref.

[3] for spectroscopy without monochromators an
undulator consisting of periodical blocks is suitable. Its Fourier structure of the
ﬁeld can be written as follows:

H(ν) = G(ν)Ψ(ν)S(ν),

(3)

where G(ν) is the Fourier structure of a standart undulator element (UE) (i.e.
an element from which an undulator half-period is formed), Ψ(ν) is the Fourier
structure of an undulator block, as a set of UE, S(ν) is the Fourier structure
of the undulator, as a set blocks. G(ν) is the expression for an ironless electro-
magnetic undulator with the winding of an optimal proﬁle section [3]:

For n-fold balanced charge motion in the undulator block (this corresponds to

the condition of turning to zero of the n-fold integral from the UR ﬁeld along
undulator block), with period number N , the Fourier structure is [3]:

where L = 2l/λ0, i.e.
it deﬁnes the distances between the blocks in units of
half-periods, and parameter δ deﬁnes the phasing of the blocks switching on:
the value δ = 0 correspondes to the in phase switching on; the value δ = 1
correspondes to switching oninthe opposite phase.

As was shown in Ref. [3] for the purpose of monochromator-free spectroscopy
the integral spectrum, taken as the diﬀerence in the integral spectra correspond-
ing to the undulator state with in phase and opposite phase switching on, is
(1) (further, the diﬀerential UR kernel).
most suitable as the kernel of Eq.
Since for such a kernel the low frequency range of the spectrum is suppressed
and accordingly the contributions of ”oﬀ-axis” particles into the radiation are
also suppressed, the σ-component polarization appears. Further, by S(ν) the
expression corresponding to the phase state diﬀerence is meant.

3. Object reaction on UR ﬂux

Undulators for obtaining arbitrary UR are described in detail in the litera-
ture. It is possible to modulate the properties of the UR ﬂyx for a multiblock
undulator, as described above, either by changing the geometrical parameters of
the UE, or by changing the contribution to undulator of the separate elements,
or by changing the blocks location.

If the ﬁeld is modulated by changing the geometrical parameters of the UE,
then the most technically realized, in this case, is changing of the magnetic gap.
However, if we consider the dipole exitation UR regime, then the corresponding
changing interval h does not essentially change the form of the spectrum. This
is clearly seen if one considers the integral UR spectrum according to Eq. (2)
in the ﬁrst UR harmonic approximation. In this case (2) becomes

(C =const.) and integra loperator K(h, η(λ)) = dΦ/d¯ω is degenerate because it
can by written as K(h, η) = K1(h)K2(η). If we consider a set of harmonics, for

3

example the ﬁrst and the third, then changing of h leads to a rearrangement of
the contributions of these harmonics in the general spectrum.

Changing the contributions of the UE in the frame of expression (5), is really
possible only for an electromagnetic undulator system, and even this is possible
only in discrete limits. Therefore in this work this case is not considered.

So, the most simple variant of UR ﬁeld modulation is modulation by chang-
ing the undulator blocks location, i.e., by changing the distance L between the
blocks. It is obvious that an arbitrary L can by realized for L > 0 (by mechan-
ical removement), because for L < 0 only discrete values exist (by rearranging
the contributions into the undulator).

The reaction of an object with spectral sensitivity A(λ) by the full capture
of the UR ﬂux over all wavelengths changable over the undulator L is deﬁned
as follows:

I(L) =

A(λ)

(η(λ), L)

At L → ∞, I(L) goes asymptioticaly to 0; that is why changing the interval of
L is deﬁned by giving the reaction level I(L). On the other side, real limitations
on changing of L exist. They are correlated with the value of the intervening
space in the insertion device. Since the limits of changing of L deﬁne the method
resolution (∆λ/λ ≈ 1/Lmax),at a certain value of the intervening space Lmax,
it is better to use blocks with minimal values N , which guarantee a meaningful
level I(L) over the whole interval, and for making the radiation characteristics
better one has to use the maximal balancing degree of the block n = N − 1.
A solution of Eq. (8) A(η) for the measured reaction I(L) and the analyti-
cally given equation kernel K(η, L) can be found by means of the Tichonov
regularization method [4].

4. Numerical model of the algorithm

Since the resolution ∆λ/λ of the metod of deﬁning the object spectral func-
tion by its reaction (8) is a value of the order of 1/Lmax (where Lmax ∼ N ) and
the number of calculation operations grows proportionally to prodict N Lmax,
then for a simple realization of a numerical model an undulator consisting of
two blocks was used; there were four elements in every block with a balancing
degree of every block n = 3. The corresponding contribution structure of the
exitation currents of the blocks elements is written as [3] {−1; 3; −3; 1}.

As a function of spectral sensitivity of object A(η) a set of Gaussian was

used:

A(η) =

corresponding to two spectral lines with the relation ∆λ/λ with is equal to 0.35
and 0.08 respectively. (Relatively small values of ∆λ/λ correspond to a choice
of the undulator parameters made above).

The kernel of the equation was deﬁned over the interval η ∈ (0, 2), and the
limits of changing of L were taken from 0 to 20. The size of the net, which
approximates the kernel of Eq. (8) was taken equal to (200 × 400).

To solve Eq. (8) the Tichonov regularization method with a choice of the
regularization parameter according to a generalization of nonbuilding princi-
ple [4] was used. For the minimization of Tichonov functional the method of
gradients was used.

5. Conclusion

From the results of the numerical experiments one can see that the consid-
ered algotithm of monochromator-free spectroscopy may by rather perspective
for insertion devices where an active changing of the particles energy is prob-
lematic. For a realization of this method a simple undulator, consisting of two
blocks and rather small period number N in every block (≈ 5 − 20) but with
the opportunity to change the distances between the blocks, is necessary. The
theoritical resolution of this method is inversely proportional to the distance
between the blocks Lmax (in units of half-periods). The object reaction prac-
tically disappears at a shift value L ≈ 10N . This value, probably, deﬁnes the
maximally possible method resolution by a given period number N in the block.
So, if we consider a period number for each block N = 20 and a period length of
2 cm, then we will obtain Lmax ≈ 200 and accordingly the possible resolution,
∆λ/λ ≈ 1/Lmax = 5 · 10−3 (by the total length of such a twoblock system), is
equal (2N + Lmax) · 2 = 480 cm.

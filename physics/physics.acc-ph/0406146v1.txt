Abstract

To achieve high focal spot intensities in heavy ion fusion, the ion beam must be compressed

longitudinally by factors of ten to one hundred before it is focused onto the target. The longitudinal

compression is achieved by imposing an initial velocity proﬁle tilt on the drifting beam. In this

paper, the problem of longitudinal drift compression of intense charged particle beams is solved

analytically for the two important cases corresponding to a cold beam, and a pressure-dominated

beam, using a one-dimensional warm-ﬂuid model describing the longitudinal beam dynamics.

INTRODUCTION

High energy ion accelerators, transport systems and storage rings [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] have a

wide range of applications ranging from basic research in high energy and nuclear physics, to

applications such as heavy ion fusion, spallation neutron sources, and nuclear waste transmu-

tation. Of particular importance at the high beam currents and charge densities of interest

for heavy ion fusion are the eﬀects of the intense self-ﬁelds produced by the beam space

charge and current on determining detailed equilibrium, stability, and transport properties.

In general, a complete description of collective processes in intense charged particle beams

is provided by the nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell equations [1] for the self-consistent evolution of

the beam distribution function, fb(x, p, t), and the self-generated electric and magnetic ﬁelds,

E(x, t) and B(x, t). While considerable progress has been made in analytical and numerical

simulation studies of intense beam propagation [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71],

the eﬀects of ﬁnite geometry and intense self-ﬁelds often make it diﬃcult to obtain de-

tailed predictions of beam equilibrium, stability, and transport properties based on the

Vlasov-Maxwell equations. To overcome this complexity, considerable theoretical progress

has also been made in the development and application of one-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell

models [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79] to describe the longitudinal beam dynamics for

a long coasting beam, with applications ranging from plasma echo excitations, to the in-

vestigation of coherent soliton structures, both compressional and rarefactive (hole-like).

Such one-dimensional Vlasov descriptions rely on using a geometric-factor (g-factor) model

[79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85] to incorporate the average eﬀects of the transverse beam geom-

etry and the surrounding wall structure. Despite the many successful applications of such

one-dimensional Vlasov models to describe the longitudinal dynamics of long costing beams,

even a one-dimensional Vlasov description is often too complicated to be analyzed in detail,

except in some simple limiting cases. The next level of description of the nonlinear beam

dynamics is provided by the macroscopic ﬂuid equations, which correspond to the ﬁrst three

momentum moments of the Vlasov equation, with some particular closure scheme which

relates the higher moments to the ﬁrst three [86, 87, 88]. The usual closure assumption for

collisionless plasma is provided by the adiabatic equation of state (ds/dt = 0, where s is

the entropy per the unit volume), which expresses the thermal pressure as a function of the

2

density. In one dimension, this is given by pλ−3 = const. [86, 87, 88], where λ is the line

density of beam particles and p is the line pressure. Such a one-dimensional ﬂuid model,

combined with the adiabatic equation of state and a g-factor model for the average electric

ﬁeld, ﬁts in the class of one-dimensional ﬂuid problems which can be solved exactly [89]

using the formalism described in Sec. II.

In presently envisioned conﬁgurations for heavy ion fusion, multiple, high-current, heavy

ion beams are focused to a small spot size onto the target capsule. To achieve a high-

intensity beam focused onto the target, the beams are ﬁrst accelerated and then compressed

longitudinally. One of the possible ways to compress the beam longitudinally is to use a the

drift compression scheme illustrated in Fig. 1 [90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]. The

scheme consists of two parts. In the ﬁrst stage, an initial tilt in the longitudinal velocity

proﬁle

Vf (x) is imposed on the long charge bunch with some particular line density proﬁle

−

Λf (x). After time Tshape, the beam line density evolves to a proﬁle Λin(x), with velocity proﬁle

Vin(x). At this time, an additional velocity tilt Vin(x)

−
−
and the beam is left with line density Λin(x) and velocity tilt

Vcomp(x) is imposed on the beam,

Vcomp(x). We refer to this stage

−

as the beam shaping stage. This stage requires beam manipulation (imposing the velocity

tilt) and is done when the charge bunch is very long. At this stage, the longitudinal pressure

and electric ﬁeld are negligible, and the beam dynamics is governed by free convection.

During this stage the beam may or may not be compressed. The purpose of this stage is

to shape the beam line density proﬁle into a certain intermediate line density proﬁle Λin(x)

with velocity proﬁle

Vcomp(x), such that during the next stage, which we refer to as the

−

drift compression stage, after further axial drift during the time interval Tcomp (see Fig. 1),

the beam is compressed longitudinally until the space-charge force or the internal thermal

pressure stops the longitudinal compression of the charge bunch [90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96,

97, 98, 99]. At the point of maximum compression, the velocity tilt proﬁle is completely

removed and the beam is left with desired line density Λ0(x). The ﬁnal focus magnets then

focus the beam onto the target, and the beam heats and compresses the target fuel. Stated

this way, the longitudinal drift compression problem in the beam frame is equivalent to the

time-reversed problem of the beam expanding into vacuum with zero initial velocity proﬁle,

and the speciﬁed initial line density proﬁle Λ0(x) which is desired at the time of maximum

compression before ﬁnal focusing. In this paper we employ a one-dimensional warm-ﬂuid

model with adiabatic equation of state to study this problem analytically for arbitrary ﬁnal

(maximally compressed) line density proﬁles Λ0(x).

3

We consider here the two separate cases corresponding to a cold beam, and a pressure-

dominated beam. In the case of a cold beam, the internal thermal pressure is negligible,

and the dynamics of the drift compression is governed by the self-generated electric ﬁeld.

In the case of a pressure-dominated beam, the self-generated electric ﬁeld is negligible, and

the beam compresses under the inﬂuence of the thermal pressure and the initial velocity tilt

Vcomp(x). One of the compression scenarios considered for heavy ion fusion is neutralized

−
drift compression, where the beam propagates through a charge-neutralizing background

plasma as it compresses longitudinally.

In such a scenario, the beam is compressed only

against the internal pressure. For simplicity, the present analysis is carried out in the beam

frame where the particle motions are nonrelativistic. The ﬁnal results can be then Lorentz

transformed back to the laboratory frame, moving with axial velocity

Vb =

βbc relative

−

−

to the average motion of the particles in the beam frame.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy describe the one-dimensional

warm-ﬂuid model equations and the formalism used for solving them analytically. In Secs. III

and IV, the general solution for the expansion problem (the inverse to the drift compression

stage problem) is obtained analytically for the two cases corresponding to a cold beam, and a

pressure-dominated beam. In Sec. V the general solution to drift compression stage obtained

in Secs. III and IV is illustrated by several examples. In Sec. VI we brieﬂy discuss the beam

shaping stage.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

In the present analysis, we employ a one-dimensional warm-ﬂuid model [86, 87, 88, 91] to

describe the longitudinal nonlinear beam dynamics with average electric ﬁeld given by the

g-factor model with ebEz =

charge-dominated beam with ﬂat-top density proﬁle in the transverse plane, g

−

e2
b g∂λ/∂x [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]. For example, for a space-
2 ln(rw/rb)

≃

[85]. Here, λ(x, t) is the line density, eb is the charge of a beam particle, rw is the conducting

wall radius, and rb is the beam radius. Generally, the beam radius, and therefore the g-

factor, are functions of the line density and the external transverse focusing, and can change

during the beam compression. In most of the drift compression scenarios it is preferable to

maintain the beam radius (and therefore the g-factor) constant during the beam compression

by adjusting the external transverse focusing [90, 91, 92]. Therefore, in the present analysis,

we assume that the g-factor is a constant.

For future application in Secs.

III-VI, in the remainder of this section we summarize

well-established theoretical technique developed in ﬂuid mechanics [89] that can be used to

solve the nonlinear ﬂuid equations (1) and (2). By introducing the velocity potential φ,

Assuming that v is not a deﬁnite function of w [v

= v(w)], we multiply Eq. (9) by

∂(t, x)/∂(w, v) and use the multiplication property for determinants. This gives

The case when v is a deﬁnite function of w in some region of the (x, t) plane corresponds to

a simple wave and will be considered later. Because λ = λ(w), Eq. (11) reduces to

Substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (12), we obtain the equation for χ [89]

Note that Eq. (13) is a linear partial diﬀerential equation for the function χ(v, w). By

introducing the eﬀective sound speed deﬁned by c2 = λdw/dλ, we can rewrite Eq. (13) as

where c2 is to be regarded as a function of w. Equation (14) together with Eq. (8) can be

used to obtain the solution to the system of equations (1) and (2) everywhere in the (x, t)

plane except in the regions corresponding to simple wave solutions where v = v(c) [89]. In

this case, the Jacobian ∆ = ∂(v, w)/∂(x, t) vanishes identically. In deriving Eq. (11), we

divided Eq. (9) by this Jacobian, and the solution for which ∆ = 0 is not recovered. Thus,

a simple wave solution cannot be recovered from the general equation (13).

If v is a function of λ only, as in a simple wave, we can rewrite Eqs. (1) and (2) as [89]

Equations (19) and (20) give the general solution for the simple wave. The two signs

in Eqs. (19) and (20) correspond to the direction of wave propagation: (+) is for a wave

propagating in the positive x direction, and (

) is for a wave propagating in the negative x

−

direction.

It is also convenient to solve Eqs. (1) and (2) using the method of characteristics [89].

Multiplying Eq. (1) by c/λ, and then adding and subtracting from Eq. (2), and making use

of the relation ∂w/∂x = (dw/dλ)(∂λ/∂x) = (c2/λ)(∂λ/∂x), we obtain

invariants J+ and J− which are transported to this point along the C+ and C− characteristics

from the region where the values of J+ and J− (and therefore v and c) are known. Equations

(22) and (24) are very convenient for numerical solution of the equations of motion and also

for general analysis of the ﬂow.

The totality of available space-time generally consists of the regions where either a simple

wave solution [Eq. (20)] or a general solution [solution to Eq. (14) together with Eq. (8)]

is applicable. The boundary between the simple wave solution and the general solution,

like any boundary between two analytically diﬀerent solutions, is a characteristic [89]. In

solving particular problems (see Sec. V), the value of the function χ(v, w) on this boundary

characteristic must be determined. The matching condition at the boundary between the

simple wave solution and the general solution is obtained by substituting Eq. (8) for x and

t into the equation for the simple wave [Eq. (20)]. This gives

Here we consider two separate cases. For the case of a cold beam (p0 = 0 and c2

where we can neglect the electric ﬁeld compared to the thermal pressure, it follows that

it follows that w = c2

w = (c2

p/2)(λ/λ0)2, and c2(w) = λdw/dλ = 2w.

IV. GENERAL SOLUTION OF THE INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM

In this section we make use of Eqs. (30) and (34) to solve the initial value problem for the

case of beam expansion into vacuum. The initial conditions for this problem are zero ﬂow

velocity at every point, v0(x, 0) = 0, and prescribed density proﬁle λ(x, 0) = λ0(x), which

expresses the initial line density as a function of x. At some later time t = tf , the density and

velocity proﬁles will be given by the functions λ(x, tf ) and v(x, tf ) which are the solutions

to Eqs. (1) and (2). Since the equations of motion [Eqs. (1) and (2)] are time-reversible, the
ﬂow described by ¯λ(x, t) = λ(x, tf −
equations with initial conditions ¯v(x, 0) =

t) are also solutions to these
v(x, tf ) and ¯λ(x, 0) = λ(x, tf ). At time t = tf

v(x, tf −
−

t) and ¯v(x, t) =

−

this ﬂow has zero velocity proﬁle (¯v = 0) and the density proﬁle is given by the initial proﬁle
for the expansion problem, i.e., ¯λ(x, tf ) = λ0(x).

To solve the initial value problem we assume that the density proﬁle λ0(x), or equivalently

the sound velocity proﬁle c0(x), decreases monotonically to zero at the beam boundary

x =

x0, is an even function of x, and is an invertable function for x > 0 everywhere where

±

the density is non-zero. Therefore, we assume that at t = 0 the inverted proﬁle x0(c) is

known. The condition that c0(x) decreases monotonically to zero at the beam boundary

means that no rarefaction wave is launched from the boundary into the beam as it expands.

We will treat the case with discontinues in c0(x) at the beam boundary in one of the examples

in Sec. V. Since we are interested in the time-reversed problem of beam compression, we

assume that multi-valued ﬂow does not form as the beam expands. This is equivalent to

considering only initial density proﬁles with ﬁrst derivative decreasing continuously from the

beam center to the beam edge. This guarantees that the portions of the beam with smaller

density accelerate faster than the portions with lower density, and as a result, the ﬂow is

never multi-valued. We will treat the case with multi-valued ﬂow in one of the examples in

Sec. V. The region of ﬂow in the (x, t) plane and its boundaries are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is

obvious that the ﬂow is symmetric under reﬂection, x

x, and therefore we need only to

solve the equations in the region x > 0. In general, there are four regions of ﬂow. (See Figs.

2 and 3.) Each is separated from the others by two characteristics, the C− characteristic

P on which v = nc, and the C+ characteristic Q on which v + nc = nc0. The boundary

conditions are given by

v(0, t) = 0,

c(x, 0) = c0(x), v(x, 0) = 0, for

< x0,

c[xb(t), t] = 0,

(39)

where x0 = xb(t = 0) is the initial beam half-width, and xb(t) is the coordinate of the beam

As evident from Fig. 2, the ﬂow at every point in Region I is brought to this point by

the characteristics originating from the x-axis at t = 0. Hence, the ﬂow in this region is

fully determined by the boundary conditions c(x, 0) = c0(x) and v(x, 0) = 0. The ﬂow at

every point in the Region II, which is separated from Region I by the C+ characteristic Q

originating from the origin in the (x, t) plane, is brought to this point by the characteristics

originating from the x = 0 line where v(0, t) = 0, and from Region I. Therefore, the boundary

condition for Region II is given by v(0, t) = 0 and by the ﬂow on the separating characteristic

Q. The ﬂow at every point in Region III, which is adjacent to the beam edge and separated

from Region I by the C− characteristic P originating from the beam edge at t = 0 in the

(x, t) plane, is brought to this point by the characteristics originating from the beam edge

where c[xb(t), t] = 0, and from Region I. Therefore, the boundary condition for Region III

is given by c[xb(t), t] = 0 and by the ﬂow on the separating characteristic P. The ﬂow at

every point in Region IV, which is separated from Region II by the P characteristic and from

Region III by the Q characteristic, is brought to this point by the characteristics originating

from Region II and Region III. Therefore the boundary condition for Region IV is given by

the ﬂow on the separating characteristics P and Q.

The function χ(v, c) and Eq. (8) provide the map of the ﬂow region in the (x, t) plane

illustrated in Fig. 2, to the (v, c) plane (Fig. 3). The region is a triangle (0 < c < c0) limited

from above by the C+ characteristic Q which is a straight line in the (v, c) plane since on

this characteristic J+ = v + nc = nc0 = const (n = 1, 2). This mapping is not one-to-one. In

fact Regions I and II and Regions III and IV in the (x, t) plane map into the same regions

in the (v, c) plane, which means that in the (v, c) plane there will be four functions, χI, χII,

χIII and χIV , deﬁned inside the area depicted in Fig. 3, which map the depicted (v, c) region

back into Regions I, II, III and IV in the (x, t) plane, respectively, by means of Eq. (8).

Since at t = 0, v(x, 0) = 0 and c(0, x) = c0(x), by making use of Eq. (8) we obtain the

boundary conditions for χI(v, c) in the (v, c) plane in Region I, which can be expressed as

t = 0 =

= 0, or equivalently,

∂χI
∂w !v=0

 

∂χI
∂c !v=0

 

= 0,

Since v(0, t) = 0 at x = 0, the boundary condition for χII(v, c) is

Next, we consider separately the two cases corresponding to a cold beam, and a pressure-

dominated beam.

A. Pressure-dominated beam

The general solution for the case of a pressure-dominated beam is given by Eq. (30). To

satisfy the boundary condition in Eq. (40), we are required to choose

χI = f (c

f (c + v).

Substituting Eq. (52) into Eq. (41), we obtain f ′(c) = x0(c)/2, and therefore

Here, we have chosen the integration constant so that f (c0) = 0. Substituting Eq. (53) into

x0(¯c)d¯c.

f (c) =

Eq. (52) then gives

In Region II, to satisfy the boundary conditions in Eq. (42), we are required to choose

x0(¯c)d¯c.

χI =

c−v

c+v

χII = g(c

v) + g(c + v).

To satisfy the boundary conditions in Eqs. (43) and (44) we choose g(c) = f (c). Hence, the

solution in Region II is given by

It is readily shown that the solution in Region III which satisﬁes all of the boundary condi-

and the solution in Region IV which satisﬁes all of the boundary conditions in Eqs. (48),

Finally, using Eq. (8) and the deﬁnition c2 = λdw/dλ = 2w, we obtain the solutions in

Region I,

Evidently, the density proﬁle given by Eq. (64) is correctly normalized.

The same solution can be also obtained from a kinetic description. It’s been shown in

Ref. [88] that Eqs. (1) and (2) [together with the adiabatic pressure relation p = p0(λ/λ0)3]

are the two key moments of the kinetic Vlasov equation for a waterbag distribution function

( f = const. in an enclosed area of phase space). Indeed if we denote the upper curve in

Fig. 4 as v+(x, t) and the lower curve as v−(x, t), than by multiplying the Vlasov equation

for f (x, vx, t)

B. Cold beam

Here we use the general solution in Eq. (34) to solve the same initial value problem as

discussed in the previous section, applied now to the case of a cold beam. To satisfy the

boundary condition in Eq. (40) we are required to choose

(80) that in Regions I and II, where v < 2c, the argument of f in Eq. (80) is positive, and we

can use the form of f deﬁned in Eq. (82). For v > 2c (Regions III and IV), the argument of

the function under the integral in the ﬁrst term in general solution in Eq. (34) can become

negative. Next, we show that the solution of the form in Eq. (80) with f (z) continued to the

regions where z < 0 as f (z) = f (

z), or f (z) = f (

for the case of a cold beam. Finally, substituting Eq. (87) into Eqs. (86) and (88), changing

the expansion problem for the linear density proﬁle Eq. (125) is given by Eqs. (131)–(134)

t > tcr is entirely in Regions II and IV and is given by Eqs. (133) and (134). Using Eqs. (95)

2. Pressure-dominated beam

For a pressure-dominated beam, c2 = λdw/dλ = c2

p(λ/λ0)2. Hence, for the linear density

proﬁle in Eq. (125, the initial proﬁle for x0(c) is

Region III has disappeared. Indeed, using Eqs. (61) we obtain ¯x = 1 and ¯t = 1, so that

the entire region consist of just one point. The corresponding solutions [Eqs. (139)–(141)]

The exact solution given by Eq. (141) and asymptotic solution given by Eq. (142) are com-

pared in Fig. 8 (line a) for c0t/x0 = 10.

C. Flat-top density proﬁle

As discussed in Sec II, the general ﬂow consists of regions where either a simple wave

solution [Eq. (20)] or a general solution [solution of Eq. (14) together with Eq. (8)] is appli-

cable. Up to now we have considered ﬂows with no simple wave regions. This is guaranteed

provided the initial density proﬁle is smooth everywhere except at the beam edge where the

sound speed is zero, c0(x0) = 0. Here, we consider an example with an initial ﬂat-top density

proﬁle, and a corresponding discontinuity in density at the beam edge, i.e.,

λ0(x)
λ0

= Θ(
|

x
|

< x0).

(143)

This problem is equivalent to the one-dimensional expansion of a uniform-density gas into

vacuum in a vessel in which the end walls are instantly removed. The (x, t) plane is shown in

Fig. 11. The ﬂow consists of three regions. In Region I the gas is at rest, and the information

that the walls have been removed, which is carried by the C− characteristic P into the gas,

does not reach this region. Region II is the region occupied by a simple rarefaction wave

which is centered at t = 0 and x = x0 in the (x, t) plane, and is described by the simple wave

solution in Eq. (20). Region III is the region of interference of this wave and and its reﬂection

from the origin (or another rarefaction wave coming from the other end of the gas region).

This region is described by the general solution in Eq. (14) together with Eq. (8). Regions

II and III are separated by the C+ characteristic Q. On this characteristic the boundary

condition in Eq. (27) holds. To determine the function f (v) in Eqs. (20) and (27), we note

that for t = 0, x = x0 and therefore f (v) = x0 = const. Also note that the characteristics

C+ bring the value of the Rieman invariant J+ = v + nc = nc0 = const to all points of

Region II. Therefore, the solution in Region II is given by

D. Continuous density proﬁle (no sharp edge boundary)

Up to this point we have considered ﬂows which do not form shocks and therefore are

time-reversible. For such ﬂows, the compression problem is equivalent to the time-reversed

expansion problem. In this section, we consider an example of ﬂuid ﬂow which forms shocks.

For simplicity, we consider here a beam without sharp edges in which λ0(x) decreases to zero

monotonically as x

. In particular, we consider the initial density proﬁle given by

→ ±∞

λ0

(169)

Expanding ﬂows with initially smooth proﬁles extending to x

such as in Eq. (169)

→ ±∞

are entirely in Regions I and II. Indeed Regions I and II are separated from Regions III and

IV by the C− characteristic P with v

nc =

nc0 = 0 (n = 1, 2). However, for proﬁles such

as Eq. (169), c0(x) > 0 for all

, and therefore the entire region

Regions I and II in the (v, c) plane (see Fig. 3). As a result, the solution for the ﬂow is given

g(λ/λ0), and therefore c/c0 = 1/ cosh(x/x0). Substi-

As evident from Eq. (177), (∂¯v/∂¯λ)t > 0 in some regions, which means that the regions with

higher density accelerated faster than the regions with lower density, and eventually multi-
valued ﬂow is formed (see Fig. 14). This is unlike the previous examples where ∂¯v/∂¯λ)t < 0

for all t, and there was no multi-valued ﬂow.

VI. BEAM SHAPING

In this section we consider the beam shaping problem referred to in Sec. I. That is, given

an initial line density proﬁle Λin(x) at time t = 0 and ﬁnal line density proﬁle Λf (x) at time

t = Tshape, what are the initial and ﬁnial velocity proﬁles, Vin(x) and Vf (x) respectively.

The beam shaping stage is necessary to prepare the beam density proﬁle for the ﬁnal drift

29

compression discussed in previous sections. Here, as in previous sections, we analyze the

time-reversed problem. Therefore, the initial density proﬁle Λin(x) for the time-reversed

problem is given by Eqs. (95) and (96) for a cold beam, or by Eq. (64) for a pressure-

dominated beam, and the ﬁnal density proﬁle Λf (x) illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.

During the beam shaping stage, the longitudinal pressure and electric ﬁeld are negligible

and the beam dynamics is governed by free convection decribed by

Here, Eq. (182) follows from multiplying Eq. (12) by dw/dλ, and is equivalent to Eq. (1).

Equation (181) implies that the function v is constant along the characteristic given by

dx/dt = v, which therefore correspond to straight lines given by

x = vt + f (v),

or v(x, t) = V [x

v(x, t)t],

(183)

−

where v(x, 0) = V (x) and V [f (v)] = v. Equation (183) gives a general solution to Eq.

(181) for the velocity proﬁle v(x, t). Substituting Eq. (183) into Eq. (182), we obtain t =

f ′(v) + q(v)/λ, where q(v) is an arbitrary function of v. Using the initial condition that

at t = 0, λ = λ0(v), we obtain the solution to Eqs. (182), λ = λ0(v)/[1 + t/f ′(v)]. Note that

VII. CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, we have studied the longitudinal drift compression of an intense charged

particle beam using a one-dimensional warm-ﬂuid model. We have reformulated the drift

compression problem as the time-reversed expansion problem of the beam with arbitrary

line density proﬁle and zero velocity proﬁle. We have obtained exact analytical solutions

to the expansion problem for the two important cases corresponding to a cold beam, and

a pressure-dominated beam, using a general formalism which reduces the system of warm-

ﬂuid equations to a linear second-order partial diﬀerential equation. We obtained simple

approximate analytical formulas connecting the initial and ﬁnal line density proﬁle and ﬂow

velocity proﬁle for these two cases. The asymptotic velocity proﬁles are linear in both cases,

and correspond to free expansion as t

. The scaled density proﬁle for a pressure-

→ ∞

dominated beam far from the compression point was shown to be the functional inverse

of the compressed density proﬁle in Eq. (64). For a cold beam, the proﬁles are connected

by the Abel transform [Eqs. (95) and (96)]. The general solution has been illustrated for

parabolic, linear, and ﬂat-top initial (compressed) line density proﬁles. For the case of a

parabolic density proﬁle, we have recovered the familiar self-similar solution [90, 91, 92]. We

have illustrated the formation of multi-valued ﬂow with the exactly-solvable example in Eq.

(169), and identiﬁed the conditions for shock-free compression.

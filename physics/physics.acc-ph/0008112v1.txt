Abstract
A magnetic bunch compressor was designed and is be-
ing commissioned to provide higher peak current for the
Advanced Photon Source’s (APS) Low-Energy Undulator
Test Line (LEUTL) free-electron laser (FEL) [1]. Of great
concern is limiting emittance growth due to coherent syn-
chrotron radiation (CSR). Tolerances must also be carefully
evaluated to ﬁnd stable operating conditions and ensure that
the system can meet operational goals. Automated match-
ing and tolerance simulations allowed consideration of nu-
merous conﬁgurations, pinpointing those with reduced er-
ror sensitivity. Simulations indicate tolerable emittance
growth up to 600 A peak current, for which the normal-
ized emittance will increase from 5 to about 6.8 µm. The
simulations also provide predictions of emittance variation
with chicane parameters, which we hope to verify experi-
mentally.

INTRODUCTION

A companion paper [2] reviews magnetic bunch compres-
sion and shows a schematic of our system. I assume the
reader is familiar with this paper. The APS bunch com-
pressor design is an outgrowth of studies [3] by P. Emma
and V. Bharadwaj of Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC). They explored a number of designs, including
symmetric and asymmetric four-dipole chicanes. Starting
from this work, I investigated a large number of conﬁgu-
rations with various values of R56, asymmetry, and ﬁnal
current. For each conﬁguration, detailed longitudinal and
transverse matching was performed, followed by tracking
with CSR and wakeﬁelds. Then, sensitivity analysis was
performed for all conﬁgurations, followed by jitter simula-
tions for the least sensitive conﬁgurations.

This work relied on elegant [4], a 6-D code with a fast
simulation of CSR effects, plus longitudinal and transverse
wakeﬁelds. elegant also performs optimization of actual
tracking results, such as bunch length, energy spread, and
emittance.

Simulation of the linac uses the RFCA element, a matrix-
based rf cavity element with exact phase dependence. Our
linac has quadrupoles around the accelerating structures.
Hence, I split each 3-m section into about 20 pieces, be-
tween which are inserted thin-lens, 2nd-order quadrupole
elements. A series of such elements is used for each
quadrupole.

A Green’s function technique is used to model wake-
ﬁelds, using a tabulation of the SLAC-structure wake func-
tions provided by P. Emma [5]. To reduce running time,

one longitudinal wake element is used per 3-m section,
which is a good approximation for relativistic particles. For
transverse wakes, I used one wake element per rf cavity el-
ement (about 20 per section).

The CSR model used by elegant is based on an equa-
tion [6] for the energy change of an arbitrary line charge
distribution as a function of the position in the bunch and
in a bending magnet. Details of this model will be pre-
sented by the author at an upcoming conference. Effects of
changes in the longitudinal distribution within a dipole are
included. CSR in drift spaces is included by propagating
the terminal CSR “wake” in each bend through the drifts
with the beam.

2 MATCHING

Longitudinal and transverse matching has the goal of pro-
viding conﬁgurations for the 300-A and 600-A LEUTL op-
erating points [2]. The starting point for the simulations is
macro particle data generated [7] with PARMELA, giving
the 6-D distribution after the photoinjector (PI). See Figure
1 in [2].

Longitudinal matching involves adjusting the phase and
voltage of L2 (see [2] for nomenclature) to obtain the de-
sired current and energy after the chicane. Then, L4 and
L5 are adjusted to minimize the energy spread and obtain
the desired ﬁnal energy. Longitudinal matching includes
longitudinal wakeﬁelds, rf curvature, and higher-order ef-
fects in the beam transport, by matching tracked properties
of the simulated beam.

Figure 1 shows the longitudinal phase space for the 300-
A case with R56 = −65 mm, which exhibits a current spike
of nearly 1200 A. The matching ignores this spike (which
is shorter than a slippage length for 530 nm) because of the
way “current” is deﬁned [2].

the bunch considerably.

Earlier simulations showed that emittance trends can be
changed signiﬁcantly by inconsistent values of the hori-
zontal beta function at the exit of B4. All of these sub-
tleties will make for difﬁcult interpretation of experiments
in which R56 is varied. However, because compression to
different currents for ﬁxed R56 involves only adjustment
of the rf phases and voltages, comparision of the emit-
tance growth for different amounts of compression should
be more straightforward.

3 TOLERANCE DETERMINATION

Tolerances are driven by the FEL gain length, trajectory,
and wavelength stability requirements [9]. The 10% rms
gain length variation limit is easy to use in elegant as it
computes FEL performance directly using Xie’s parame-
terization [10]. Beam trajectory limits (∼50 µm, ∼50µr)
are included separately as they are not incorporated into
Xie’s formula. The 1-nm rms wavelength variation limit
is a challenging goal at 530 nm as it puts a 0.1% limit on
energy variation.

The analysis begins by running single-parameter
“sweeps” to assess the effect on the constrained quanti-
ties (gain length, trajectory, and wavelength) of accelera-
tor parameters (e.g., rf phase). Sweeps included rf phase
and voltage; photoinjector timing, charge, and energy; and
chicane dipole strength. From these sweeps, a script deter-
mines the limit on each parameter change due to the var-
ious speciﬁcations, showing that conﬁgurations with the
largest R56 are least sensitive to difﬁcult-to-control tim-
ing and phase errors. These conﬁgurations experience the
most emittance degradation from CSR, but tend to yield the
shortest gain length as they have the smallest energy spread
(L2 being closer to crest).

The limits, shown in Table 1, are larger for the 600-A
case because the 1-nm wavelength constraint is easier at
120 nm than 530 nm. Nine parameters are limited primar-
ily by the wavelength constraint and four others by hori-
zontal trajectory constraints. Hence, to determine the rms
tolerance, one simply divides each sweep limit by √N, N

Figure 2: Typical twiss parameters in the chicane region.

Following longitudinal matching, transverse matching is
done for each conﬁguration. Initial Twiss parameters are
obtained from the rms properties of the PARMELA beam.
Starting values for the quadrupoles were obtained from
matching “by hand” for one conﬁguration. Four sequen-
tial elegant runs work the beta functions down the linac.
The most important constraints maintain small beta func-
tions in the linac (for transverse wakeﬁeld control), small
horizontal beta in dipole B4 (to reduce CSR effects), and
matching for the emittance measurement sections. Figure
2 shows sample Twiss parameters in the chicane region.

The matching is highly automated, so that only the de-
sired beam current and energy needs to be speciﬁed. Eval-
uation of tolerances and randomized simulations are also
automated, being set up by scripts from the corresponding
matching runs. Transfer of data between simulation stages
is handled using SDDS ﬁles and scripts [8], reducing errors
and increasing the number of conﬁgurations that can be ex-
amined. For example, a script is used to scan all conﬁgu-
rations and give power supply speciﬁcations. A distributed
queue utilizing 50 workstations is used to run the simula-
tions.

Figure 3 shows emittance vs. R56 for the symmetric
(A=1) and asymmetric (A=2) cases at 300 A and 600 A.
For 300 A, the symmetric and asymmetric cases are very
similar. For 600 A, the difference is 10% or more, which
should be measurable.

One surprise in Figure 3 is that the emittance does
not uniformly increase as |R56| increases, even though
elegant shows the expected monotonic increase (due to
CSR) vs bending angle for a single dipole with a constant
input beam distribution. This is apparently due to variation
in the compressed bunch distribution between cases with
the same “current” but different R56. For smaller |R56|,
there are higher current spikes at the head of the bunch,
leading to a larger and more rapidly changing CSR wake,
which in turn leads to larger emittance growth. The effect
is even more pronounced in the 1200-A cases (not shown).
Insertion of the scraper between B2 and B3 to remove the
low-energy part of the beam can reduce the height and
width of the current spike, resulting in lower emittance.
Unfortunately, this also reduces the current in the rest of

being the number of parameters limited by a particular con-
straint. For the horizontal trajectory, N was doubled to
eight to allocate half the budget to nonswept parameters
(e.g., corrector magnets). Some of these phase and timing
tolerances are beyond the state of the art.

4 RANDOMIZED SIMULATIONS

Randomized simulations were used to conﬁrm the toler-
ances and examine errors not covered by the sweeps (e.g.,
corrector jitter, quadrupole jitter, and alignment). These
were done for the most stable conﬁgurations (i.e., R56 =
−65 mm). Because some tolerances are beyond the state
of the art, I used randomized simulations to determine the
impact of “relaxed” tolerances, assuming these rms levels
[11]: 1◦ rf phase jitter, 0.1% rf voltage jitter, 1 ps timing
jitter, 5% charge jitter, and 2% PI energy jitter.

Tables 2 and 3 show the results, respectively, for the
sweep-derived tolerance levels and the relaxed levels. The
sweep-derived tolerance levels result in meeting the speci-
ﬁcations for the FEL, while the relaxed levels, not surpris-
ingly, do not. One surprise in the relaxed case is the large
jitter in the vertical plane. This results from uncorrected
nonlinear dispersion in a vertical dogleg between the linac
and the LEUTL, a problem which can be readily remedi-
ated using two sextupoles [5].

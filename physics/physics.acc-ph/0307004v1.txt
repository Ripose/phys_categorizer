Abstract

The characteristics of the electron-photon showers initiated by 2 to 10 GeV electrons
aligned along the < 111 > - axis of tungsten crystals are compared with those for the
amorphous tungsten . In this energy range, as known, the positron yield at the optimal
target thicknesses is larger in a crystal case only by several percent. However, the
amount of the energy deposition in a crystal turns out to be considerably (by 20 - 50%)
lower than in an amorphous target providing the same positron yield, while the peak
energy-deposition density is approximately of the same magnitude in the both cases.

1 Introduction

The formation of electromagnetic showers in aligned single crystals was actively studied dur-
ing the last decade. The ﬁrst experimental investigation of such showers has been performed
in [1] at very high energy of incident electrons. Corresponding theoretical studies were started
with [2] where an analytic solution of the problem was obtained, assuming that energies of
all charged particles and photons involved are very high. This limitation was surmounted in
[3] by suggesting a speciﬁc form of the radiation spectrum at axial alignment and performing
corresponding simulations. Using this approach, the results of [1] for Ge crystal had been
reproduced in[4]. The results of [3] are consistent with those of [5] where another approach
was used to obtain the radiation spectrum.
In [3],[5], and [6], the shower characteristics,
such as spectral-angular distributions of photons and positrons as well as the amount of en-
ergy deposition have been obtained depending on the kind and thickness of crystal targets.
Investigations of the speciﬁc shower formation give good grounds for the idea proposed in
[7], to substitute in a positron source an axially aligned crystal target for an amorphous
one, as the enhancement of the radiation intensity is maximal just at the axial alignment.
In further experiments (see [8-13]) using 1.2-10 GeV electrons aligned to the < 111 >- axis
of tungsten crystals, measurements of some shower characteristics were already aimed to
the development of a crystal-assisted positron source. Theoretical estimations performed in
[14] display a rather good agreement with results of recent experiments [10-13]. So, we can
rely on our understanding of the physics of shower formation and on numerical results, at
least for tungsten crystals in the energy range of incident electrons below 10 GeV. Note that
just this energy range is proposed in future linear collider projects ( 2, 6.2, and 10 GeV
correspondingly for CLIC [15],NLC [16], and JLC [17] ) and is considered here.

Let us deﬁne the positron yield as the number of accepted positrons per one incident
electron and the optimal target thickness as that providing the maximal yield. According
to [3], [5], [6], the maximal yield from a crystal target is always higher than that from an
amorphous one and the excess goes up when the electron energy increases. However, the
magnitude of such an enhancement is small, less than 14% even at 10 GeV. The more pro-
nounced advantage of crystal targets appear in a considerable (by a factor of two at 10 GeV)
decrease of the energy deposition. Indeed, the thermal eﬀects caused by the energy deposited
in a target are a critical issue for any powerful positron source based on the conventional
scheme. We dwell mainly on this issue in the present paper. Below qualitative arguments are
given explaining the lower energy deposition in crystals. The total deposited energy and the
distribution of its density over the target volume are calculated for crystal and amorphous
tungsten targets using the parameters of CLIC, NLC , and JLC . Thereby, a possible gain for
these projects resulting from the use of crystal targets in the positron source is estimated. For
accurate studies of thermal eﬀects, some improvements have been performed in the computer
code developed in [3], [6]. The updated version of the code is used to study both crystal and
amorphous cases.

2 Energy deposition in crystal and amorphous targets

In the energy range under consideration we are dealing with a ”soft”(see [2]) shower when
pair production is entirely due to the conventional Bethe-Heitler mechanism, while the crystal
structure reveals in a considerable enhancement of the radiation intensity and a softness of
the photon spectra. Remember that this enhancement decreases when the particle energy

1

does so as the shower develops. Starting with some depth L0 (see discussion in [3], [6]),
further development of the shower proceeds more or less in the same way for any (crystal or
amorphous) type of the remaining part of the target. For the sake of simplicity, calculations
are performed here for the all-crystal targets. However, they may serve as a good estimate for
hybrid targets of the same total thickness and with a crystal-part length of the order of L0.
Let us remind that a hybrid target consists of a photon radiator made of a crystal followed
by a pair converter made of an amorphous piece. From Fig.1, a value of L0 & 0.2cm(0.57X0)

can be chosen for 10-GeV electrons, since the fraction of the total energy carried by photons
(∼ 0.72) has been already saturated at this depth and the mean energy of the primary
electron is suﬃciently low to eliminate crystal eﬀects in the last part. Such a saturation
takes place in amorphous targets as well, but with a lower conversion level (∼ 0.59) and at
substantially larger depth (∼ 5L0 at 10 GeV). Only a small part (less than 0.4% in the above
example) of the beam power is deposited over L0 and the energy-deposition density is much
less (about 8 times at 10 GeV) than its peak value. So, the crystal part of a hybrid target is
not exposed to serious thermal eﬀects which appear at larger depths in the later stage of the
shower development.

From calculations performed in [3], [6], the energy deposition in equivalent (providing the
same positron yield) targets is always less in the crystal case. Let us present some qualitative
arguments to explain this fact. The main process leading to the energy deposition is the
ionization loss, the rate of which, q(z), reads approximately as q(z) ≃ CQ · Nch(z), where
Nch(z) is the number of charged particles at the depth z. Strictly speaking, the coeﬃcient CQ
may depend on z but its small variation as well as a small diﬀerence of CQ-values in crystal
and amorphous cases are neglected in our estimation. So, the total energy, Q(L), deposited
over the thickness L reads

Q(L) =

For suﬃciently large L, the positron yield is roughly proportional to the total number of
charged particles, Nch(L), i.e.,for equivalent targets, the integrals in (2) are taken over the
same region of variable Nch in both cases. To prove our statement, it remains only to verify
that the logarithmic derivative which appears in the denominator of the integrand in (2) is
larger for crystals. This derivative, or logarithmic increment, characterizes the growth of the
number of charged particles. As seen in Fig.1, the conversion of the initial electron energy into
photons is going faster for crystals, where, correspondingly, the pair-production process starts
earlier and is more intensive, resulting in a larger increment. For the purposes of illustration,
the energy-deposition rate per charged particle and the logarithmic increment are shown in
Fig.2. We emphasize that the energy-deposition rate is practically the same for crystal and

amorphous samples, being almost independent of the electron energy. The non-constancy of
this rate is mainly due to the contributions of other processes like photon absorbtion and
annihilation of positrons which are taken into account by our simulations but were ignored
in the estimation of q(z) used in (1). Evidently, the role of these processes increases with
growing depth. A slow decrease of the rate at comparatively small depth is due to that of
the mean particle energy. The point is that we use the so-called non-restricted energy loss
description, where the rate diminishes when the particle energy does so. On the whole, the
results of simulations presented in Fig.2 conﬁrm the above qualitative considerations.

As shower develops, particles of suﬃciently low energy may substantially change their
direction of propagation due to single or multiple scattering. So that there even appears
a ”backward” ﬂux of particles moving upstream; they do not increase the positron yield,
however, they heat the target. This contribution is taken into account in our simulations,
where we are able to trace separately eﬀects from ”forward” and ”backward” particles and
photons. To study the shower characteristics depending on depth (z), the target is divided

into slices by planes perpendicular to the incident beam direction, taken as z-axis. The
spacing dz = 0.25 X0 is used (remember that X0 =3.5mm for tungsten). Energy deposition is
simulated within each slice and various distributions are recorded at the right-hand boundary
( plane ) of the slice. In particular, the development of momentum distributions for positrons
and photons is obtained as well as that of the beam spot size. Shown in Fig.3(a) is the energy,
∆Edep(z), deposited in slices in units of E0. This quantity is higher for the lower energy.
Note that the deposited power,Pdep, reads as Pdep = P0 · Edep/E0 where P0 is the incident

beam power. The contribution of the ”backward” particles to Edep increases with the target
thickness L; it amounts typically to about 20% at L ∼ 4X0 and thereby is not negligible. The
results of simulations presented in Fig.3 (b) clearly conﬁrm once more (cf. Fig.9 in [3]) the
statement concerning the comparison between the values of Edep in the equivalent targets.
The positron yield is calculated using the ”theoretical” acceptance conditions from [15] (
see Figs.11 and 12b in [15] ) in all three cases. The angular spread of the incident beam is
neglected and the transverse size of the beam, σ(σx = σy = σ) is set to 1.6 mm at 2 and 6.2
GeV, and to 2.5 mm at 10 GeV. At E0=2 GeV, a simulation for σ=2.0 mm was performed
as well. Corresponding results, not shown on graphs, are presented in the Table below.

Let us remind now that, at equal depths and initial energies, charged particles are softer
and have a larger angular spread for crystal targets (see, e.g., Figs. 2-5 in [14] and corre-
sponding discussion). All other things being equal, positron spectra are softer at a lower
initial energy. As an illustration of these features, the mean energy and the transverse mo-
mentum, < pt >, of ”forward” positrons are shown in Fig.4(a). We emphasize that, starting
with L ∼ X0, < pt > is almost constant and practically independent of the initial electron
energy and the type of the target (note the merging of six diﬀerent curves on Fig.4(a)). Such
result conﬁrms and extends those concerning an amorphous target; it is essentially due to a
counterbalance between the increase of the angle as a consequence of the multiple scattering
and the decrease of the positron energy with increased thickness [5]. At the same time, the
larger angular spread leads in the crystal case to a larger beam spot area, S, as seen in
Fig.4(b) where S/S0 is plotted for ”forward” charged particles. For evident reasons, the spot
area of the ”backward” charged ﬂux ( not shown in Fig.4) is somewhat larger (typically by

Whereas the average deposited power can be handled somehow (e.g., by rotating the target
and removing the excess heat through water cooling as used at SLC), the local and nearly
instantaneous energy deposition is unavoidable, while being of critical concern for target
damage. Basing on the analysis of the SLC damaged target ( see [18]), it is now adopted
that the peak energy-deposition density should not exceed 35 J/g to ensure a suﬃciently

coaxial with the incident beam direction. The radius, R, of the cylinder was about R ≃
3.7σ, in which case less than one thousandth of initial electrons does not hit the cylinder at
entry. This cylinder is sliced into disks of the thickness dz = 0.25 X0, i.e., z-spacing is the
same as in above calculations, allowing a mutual checking. In turn, each disk is divided by
circles of uniformly increasing radii with the step dr = 0.02R into 50 parts - one internal
disk (altogether, such disks form the internal cylinder ) and 49 rings. More precisely, we
have dr(σ=1.6mm)=0.12mm, dr(σ=2.0mm)= 0.15 mm, and dr(σ=2.5mm)=0.185mm. The
energy deposition and the number of charged particles is simulated in each meshed volume
providing corresponding transverse distributions for each z-slice.
It is noteworthy that z-
dependencies of shower characteristics derived from 3-dimensional distributions coincide with
those obtained in direct calculations, thereby verifying the consistency of the two essentially
diﬀerent forms of the output which we have used. From Fig.5 (b), the energy-deposition
density (EDD) drops at large cell radius, being maximal in the internal disk of each slice.
Shown in Fig.5 (a) is the EDD per one incident electron in the internal cylinder, versus the
depth. Like the positron yield and the total number of charged particles , the peak values of
EDD (PEDD) in crystals are somewhat higher and are reached at smaller depths, compared
with amorphous targets. At equal beam size, PEDD is higher for the higher energy (cf.
pairs of curves in Fig.5(a) calculated at 2 and 6.2 GeV for the same σ =1.6 mm). However,
by increasing the beam size, lower values of PEDD may be obtained even at higher energy.
This is seen in Fig.5 (a) if we compare the curves calculated at 10 GeV ( σ =2.5 mm) with
those at 6.2 GeV. Examples of transverse distributions of EDD are plotted in Fig.5(b) for

the same depth z = 4X0. The distribution of charged particle density (not shown) is similar
to that of EDD with a ratio EDD/density being almost constant within the ﬁrst ten cells
and roughly equal to the energy-deposition rate. In Fig.5(b) this similarity reveals in larger
width of distributions for crystal targets (cf. Fig.4(b) ). The EDD is presented in Fig.5 in
units of GeV · cm−3 which for tungsten corresponds to 1 GeV · cm−3 = 8.30 · 10−12J/g.

Due to an extremely short duration of the pulse, contributions to EDD from all the
incident electrons are added and the resulting EDD-value is simply the product of the ob-
tained EDD-value per e− and the number of electrons per pulse, provided that the target
reverts to initial thermal conditions during the repetition period. Some results concerning

the energy deposition in crystal and amorphous targets are presented in Table 1. For the
sake of comparison, the thicknesses of amorphous tungsten targets (Wam) are the same as
proposed for W75Re25 targets in the projects [15], [16], and [17]. For crystal targets (Wcr),
the corresponding thicknesses are determined from the equivalence rule (the same positron
yield as for Wam target). Our values for P EDD given in Table 1 are obtained using the

6

same numbers of electrons per pulse, Ne(2 GeV ) = 2.08 · 1012, Ne(6.2 GeV ) = 0.96 · 1012, and
Ne(10 GeV ) = 0.64 · 1012, as in [15], [16], and [17] respectively.

Since the parameters of the two amorphous targets such as radiation lengths and densities
almost coincide, the same is expected for shower characteristics at equal depths. However,
one should bear in mind that two diﬀerent computer codes were used in simulations, EGS4
for W75Re25 targets, and our code for Wam targets. From Table 1, the concordance of the
two approaches is almost perfect for the fraction of the deposited power, Rth. Concerning
the peak energy-deposition density, P EDD, the values obtained for the Wam target at 2 and
10 GeV are somewhat smaller than those for the W75Re25 target and the distinctions are not
too big. On the contrary, our value for the Wam target is substantially larger at 6.2 GeV.
Let us argue the point in detail. At equal beam size, the peak EDD/electron is expected to
be roughly proportional to the initial electron energy, E0. This assertion follows from the
qualitative consideration performed above and is veriﬁed by calculations. For example, if we
compare the curves in Fig.5(a) calculated at 2 and 6.2 GeV for the same σ =1.6 mm, we
obtain K =2.7 as the peak EDD ratio instead of K =3.1 from the rough estimate where
K(E02, E01) = E02/E01. At L = 4X0, which corresponds to NLC conditions, this ratio
further diminishes up to 2.55 since the peak EDD value is achieved for E0 =6.2 GeV at a
larger depth. So, at equal beam size, the relationship between P EDD values at diﬀerent
energies reads roughly as

P EDD(2) ≃ P EDD(1) · K(E02, E01) · Ne(E02)/Ne(E01) .

(3)

The P EDD in W75Re25 target at E0 =2 GeV was calculated in [15] not only for σ =2.0 mm,
but also for σ =1.6 mm, where the value of 53.1 J/g has been obtained ( at these conditions
we have 47.7 J/g for the Wam target). Using the estimate (3) with P EDD(1)=53.1 J/g and
K =2.55, we obtain for NLC conditions P EDD(2)=62.5 J/g which is consistent with our
result for the Wam target. Conversely, starting with results of [17] for the W75Re25 target,
we obtain the estimate (P EDD(1)=35 J/g, E01= 10 GeV, K =0.62) P EDD(2) ≃ 33 J/g at
σ =2.5 mm, E02=6.2 GeV. So, the P EDD value of 35 J/g at E0=6.2 GeV is more consistent
with the beam size of σ =2.5 mm than with σ =1.6 mm indicated in [16].

Comparing the magnitude of thermal eﬀects in Wam and Wcr targets providing the same
positron yield, we conclude that , using crystal targets, the total deposited energy can be
considerably diminished while the peak value of the energy-deposition density is kept ap-
proximately on the same level as in the amorphous case.

NONLINEAR ACCELERATOR PROBLEMS VIA WAVELETS:
7. INVARIANT CALCULATIONS IN HAMILTONIAN PROBLEMS

A. Fedorova, M. Zeitlin, IPME, RAS, St. Petersburg, Russia ∗ †

Abstract

In this series of eight papers we present the applications of
methods from wavelet analysis to polynomial approxima-
tions for a number of accelerator physics problems. In this
paper we consider invariant formulation of nonlinear (La-
grangian or Hamiltonian) dynamics on semidirect structure
(relativity or dynamical groups) and corresponding invari-
ant calculations via CWT.

INTRODUCTION

This is the seventh part of our eight presentations in which
we consider applications of methods from wavelet analy-
sis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems. This is a
continuation of our results from [1]-[8], in which we con-
sidered the applications of a number of analytical methods
from nonlinear (local) Fourier analysis, or wavelet analy-
sis, to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general
and with additional structures (Hamiltonian, symplectic or
quasicomplex), chaotic, quasiclassical, quantum. Wavelet
analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods,
which gives us a possibility to work with well-localized
bases in functional spaces and with the general type of
operators (differential, integral, pseudodifferential) in such
bases.
In contrast with parts 1–4 in parts 5–8 we try to
take into account before using power analytical approaches
underlying algebraical, geometrical, topological structures
related to kinematical, dynamical and hidden symmetry
of physical problems. We described a number of con-
crete problems in parts 1–4. The most interesting case
is the dynamics of spin-orbital motion (part 4).
In sec-
tion 2 we consider dynamical consequences of covariance
properties regarding to relativity (kinematical) groups and
continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (in section 3) as a
method for the solution of dynamical problems. We intro-
duce the semidirect product structure, which allows us to
consider from general point of view all relativity groups
such as Euclidean, Galilei, Poincare. Then we consider
the Lie-Poisson equations and obtain the manifestation of
semiproduct structure of (kinematic) symmetry group on
dynamical level. So, correct description of dynamics is
a consequence of correct understanding of real symmetry

ory related to semiproduct structure and explicit form of

the corresponding analytical technique which allows to
consider covariant wavelet analysis.
In part 8 we con-
sider in the particular case of afﬁne Galilei group with the
semiproduct structure the corresponding orbit technique for
constructing different types of invariant wavelet bases.

2 DYNAMICS ON SEMIDIRECT

PRODUCTS

Relativity groups such as Euclidean, Galilei or Poincare
groups are the particular cases of semidirect product con-
struction, which is very useful and simple general construc-
tion in the group theory [9]. We may consider as a basic
example the Euclidean group SE(3) = SO(3) ⊲⊳ R3, the
semidirect product of rotations and translations. In general
case we have S = G ⊲⊳ V , where group G (Lie group or
automorphisms group) acts on a vector space V and on its
dual V ∗. Let V be a vector space and G is the Lie group,
which acts on the left by linear maps on V (G also acts on
the left on its dual space V ∗). The Lie algebra of S is the
semidirect product Lie algebra, s = G ⊲⊳ V with brackets
[(ξ1, v1), (ξ2, v2)] = ([ξ1, ξ2], ξ1v2 − ξ2v1), where the in-
duced action of G by concatenation is denoted as ξ1v2. Let
(ξ, u) ∈ s = G × V , (µ, a) ∈ s∗ =
(g, v) ∈ S = G × V,
G∗×V ∗, gξ = Adgξ, gµ = Ad∗g−1 µ, ga denote the induced
left action of g on a (the left action of G on V induces a left
action on V ∗ — the inverse of the transpose of the action
on V), ρv : G → V is a linear map given by ρv(ξ) = ξv,
ρ∗v : V ∗ → G∗ is its dual. Then adjoint and coadjoint
actions are given by simple concatenation: (g, v)(ξ, u) =
(gξ, gu − (gξ)v), (g, v)(µ, a) = (gµ + ρ∗v(ga), ga). Also,
let be ρ∗va = v ⋄ a ∈ G∗ for a ∈ V ∗, which is a bilin-
ear operation in v and a. So, we have the coadjoint action:
(g, v)(µ, a) = (gµ+v ⋄(ga), ga). Using concatenation no-
tation for Lie algebra actions we have alternative deﬁnition
of v ⋄ a ∈ G∗. For all v ∈ V , a ∈ V ∗, η ∈ G we have
< ηa, v >= − < v ⋄ a, η >.

Now we consider the manifestation of semiproduct
structure of symmetry group on dynamical level. Let
F, G be real valued functions on the dual space G∗, µ ∈
G∗. Functional derivative of F at µ is the unique ele-

where δf /δµ ∈ G, δf /δa ∈ V are the functional deriva-

has the expression Xh(µ, a) = ∓(ad∗δh/δµµ − δh/δa ⋄
a, −δh/δµa). Thus, Hamiltonian equations on the dual of
a semidirect product are [9]:

So, we can see the explicit contribution to the Poisson
brackets and the equations of motion which come from the
semiproduct structure.

Now we consider according to [9] Lagrangian side of
a theory. This approach is based on variational princi-
ples with symmetry and is not dependent on Hamiltonian
formulation, although it is demonstrated in [9] that this
purely Lagrangian formulation is equivalent to the Hamil-
tonian formulation on duals of semidirect product (the cor-
responding Legendre transformation is a diffeomorphism).
We consider the case of the left representation and the left
invariant Lagrangians (ℓ and L), which depend in addi-
tional on another parameter a ∈ V ∗ (dynamical param-
eter), where V is representation space for the Lie group G
and L has an invariance property related to both arguments.
It should be noted that the resulting equations of motion,
the Euler-Poincare equations, are not the Euler-Poincare
equations for the semidirect product Lie algebra G ⊲⊳ V ∗
or G ⊲⊳ V . So, we have the following:

1. There is a left representation of Lie group G on the
vector space V and G acts in the natural way on the left
on T G × V ∗ : h(vg, a) = (hvg, ha). 2. The function
L : T G × V ∗ ∈ R is the left G-invariant. 3. Let a0 ∈
V ∗, Lagrangian La0 : T G → R, La0(vg) = L(vg, a0).
La0 is left invariant under the lift to TG of the left action
of Ga0 on G, where Ga0 is the isotropy group of a0. 4.
Left G-invariance of L permits us to deﬁne ℓ : G × V ∗ →
R by ℓ(g−
1a0) = L(vg, a0). This relation deﬁnes
for any ℓ : G × V ∗ → R the left G-invariant function
L : T G × V ∗ → R. 5. For a curve g(t) ∈ G let be
1 ˙g(t) and deﬁne the curve a(t) as the unique
ξ(t) := g(t)−
solution of the following linear differential equation with
time dependent coefﬁcients ˙a(t) = −ξ(t)a(t), with initial
condition a(0) = a0. The solution can be written as a(t) =
g(t)−

1vg, g−

1a0.

Then we have four equivalent descriptions of the cor-
responding dynamics: 1.
If a0 is ﬁxed then Hamilton’s
t2
t1 La0(g(t), ˙g(t)dt = 0 holds for
variational principle δ R
variations δg(t) of g(t) vanishing at the endpoints. 2. g(t)
satisﬁes the Euler-Lagrange equations for La0 on G. 3. The
t2
constrained variational principle δ R
t1 ℓ(ξ(t), a(t))dt = 0
holds on G × V ∗, using variations of ξ and a of the form
δξ = ˙η + [ξ, η], δa = −ηa, where η(t) ∈ G vanishes at the
endpoints. 4. The Euler-Poincare equations hold on G ×V ∗

So, we may apply our wavelet methods either on the level
of variational formulation or on the level of Euler-Poincare
equations.

3 CONTINUOUS WAVELET

TRANSFORM

Now we need take into account the Hamiltonian or La-
grangian structures related with systems (2) or (3). There-
fore, we need to consider generalized wavelets, which al-
low us to consider the corresponding structures instead of
compactly supported wavelet representation from parts 1-
4.
In wavelet analysis the following three concepts are
used now: 1). a square integrable representation U of a
group G, 2). coherent states (CS) over G, 3). the wavelet
transform associated to U. We consider now their uniﬁ-
cation [10]-[12]. Let G be a locally compact group and
Ua strongly continuous, irreducible, unitary representation
of G on Hilbert space H. Let H be a closed subgroup
of G, X = G/H with (quasi) invariant measure ν and
σ : X = G/H → G is a Borel section in a principal bun-
dle G → G/H. Then we say that U is square integrable
mod(H, σ) if there exists a non-zero vector η ∈ H such
that 0 < RX | < U (σ(x))η|Φ > |2dν(x) =< Φ|AσΦ > <
∞, ∀Φ ∈ H. Given such a vector η ∈ H called admissi-
ble for (U, σ) we deﬁne the family of (covariant) coherent
states or wavelets, indexed by points x ∈ X, as the orbit of
η under G, though the representation U and the section σ
[10]-[12]: Sσ = ησ(x) = U (σ(x))η|x ∈ X. So, coherent
states or wavelets are simply the elements of the orbit under
U of a ﬁxed vector η in representation space. We have the
following fundamental properties: 1.Overcompleteness:
the set Sσ is total in H : (Sσ)⊥ = 0. 2. Resolution prop-
erty: the square integrability condition may be represented
as a resolution relation: RX |ησ(x) >< ησ(x)|dν(x) = Aσ,
where Aσ is a bounded, positive operator with a densely
deﬁned inverse. Deﬁne the linear map Wη
: H →
L2(X, dν), (WηΦ)(x) =< ησ(x)|Φ > . Then the range
Hη of Wη is complete with respect to the scalar product
η Ψ > and Wη is unitary op-
< Φ|Ψ >η=< Φ|WηA−
erator from H onto Hη. Wη is Continuous Wavelet Trans-
form (CWT). 3. Reproducing kernel. The orthogonal pro-
jection from L2(X, dν) onto Hη is an integral operator Kσ
and Hη is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions:

(this must be resemble the symplectic or Lie-Poisson inte-
grator theory). We use the point of view of geometric quan-
tization theory (orbit method) instead of harmonic analysis.
Because of this we can consider (a) – (e) analogously. In
next part we consider construction of invariant bases.

We are very grateful to M. Cornacchia (SLAC), W. Her-
rmannsfeldt (SLAC) Mrs. J. Kono (LBL) and M. Laraneta
(UCLA) for their permanent encouragement.

The most simple cases of this construction are:

√a f (cid:0) x

In this case H is the center of GW H .

1. H = {e}. This is the standard construction of WT
over a locally compact group. It should be noted that the
square integrability of U is equivalent to U belonging to the
discrete series. The most simple example is related to the
afﬁne (ax + b) group and yields the usual one-dimensional
wavelet analysis [π(b, a)f ](x) = 1

a (cid:1) . For G =
−
SIM (2) = R2 ⊲⊳ (R+
× SO(2)), the similitude group
∗
of the plane, we have the corresponding two-dimensional
wavelets. 2. H = Hη, the isotropy (up to a phase) sub-
group of η:
this is the case of the Gilmore-Perelomov
CS. Some cases of group G are: a). Semisimple groups,
such as SU(N), SU(N|M), SU(p,q), Sp(N,R). b). the Weyl-
Heisenberg group GW H which leads to the Gabor func-
tions, i.e. canonical (oscillator)coherent states associated
with windowed Fourier transform or Gabor transform (see
also part 6): [π(q, p, ϕ)f ](x) = exp(iµ(ϕ−p(x−q))f (x−
q).
In both cases
time-frequency plane corresponds to the phase space of
group representation. c). The similitude group SIM(n) of
Rn(n ≥ 3): for H = SO(n − 1) we have the axisymmet-
ric n-dimensional wavelets. d). Also we have the case of
bigger group, containing both afﬁne and Weyl-Heisenberg
group, which interpolate between afﬁne wavelet analysis
and windowed Fourier analysis: afﬁne Weyl–Heisenberg
group [12].
In a nonrelativis-
tic setup, the natural kinematical group is the (extended)
Galilei group. Also we may adds independent space and
time dilations and obtain afﬁne Galilei group. If we restrict
the dilations by the relation a0 = a2, where a0, a are the
time and space dilation we obtain the Galilei-Schr¨odinger
group, invariance group of both Schr¨odinger and heat equa-
tions. We consider these examples in the next section. In
the same way we may consider as kinematical group the
Poincare group. When a0 = a we have afﬁne Poincare or
Weyl-Poincare group. Some useful generalization of that
afﬁnization construction we consider for the case of hidden
metaplectic structure in part 6. But the usual representa-
tion is not square–integrable and must be modiﬁed: restric-
tion of the representation to a suitable quotient space of
the group (the associated phase space in our case) restores
square – integrability: G −→ homogeneous space. Our
goal is applications of these results to problems of Hamil-
tonian dynamics and as consequence we need to take into
account symplectic nature of our dynamical problem. Also,
the symplectic and wavelet structures must be consistent

e). Relativity groups.

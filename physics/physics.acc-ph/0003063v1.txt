1 Problem

The principle of an electrostatic accelerator is that when a charge e escapes from a conducting
plane that supports a uniform electric ﬁeld of strength E0, then the charge gains energy eE0d
as it moves distance d from the plane. Where does this energy come from?

Show that the mechanical energy gain of the electron is balanced by the decrease in the

electrostatic ﬁeld energy of the system.

2 Solution

Once the charge has reached distance d from the plane, the static electric ﬁeld Ee at an
arbitrary point r due to the charge can be calculated by summing the ﬁeld of the charge
plus its image charge,

Ee(r, d) =

where r1 (r2) points from the charge (image) to the observation point r, as illustrated in
Fig. 1. The total electric ﬁeld is then E0ˆz + Ee.

The charge e and its image charge −e at positions (r, θ, z) =
Figure 1:
(0, 0, ±d) with respect to a conducting plane at z = 0. Vectors r1 and r2 are
directed from the charges to the observation point (r, 0, z).

It turns out to be convenient to use a cylindrical coordinate system, where the observation

point is r = (r, θ, z) = (r, 0, z), and the charge is at (0, 0, d). Then,

1,2 = r2 + (z ∓ d)2.

When the particle has traversed a potential diﬀerence V = E0d, it has gained energy eV and
the electromagnetic ﬁeld has lost the same energy.

In a practical “electrostatic” accelerator, the particle is freed from an electrode at po-
tential −V and emerges with energy eV in a region of zero potential. However, the particle
could not be moved to the negative electrode from a region of zero potential by purely
electrostatic forces unless the particle lost energy eV in the process, leading to zero overall
energy change. An “electrostatic” accelerator must have an essential component (such as a
battery) that provides a nonelectrostatic force that can absorb the energy extracted from
the electrostatic ﬁeld while moving the charge from potential zero, so as to put the charge
at rest at potential −V prior to acceleration.

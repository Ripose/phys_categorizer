Abstract

The status and initial performance of a simulation program CAIN for interaction
region of linear colliders is described. The program is developed to be applicable
for e+e−, e−e−, e−γ and γγ linear colliders. As an example of an application,
simulation of a γγ collider option of NLC is reported.

1 Introduction

As additional options of e+e−linear colliders, feasibility studies for e−e−, e−γ and γγ col-
liders have become active in recent years. For linear colliders, detailed knowledge of
beam-beam interaction is important to estimate backgrounds in the detector as well as
to calculate realistic luminosity. In order to study these eﬀects, a Monte Carlo simula-
tion program for beam-beam interaction in e+e−colliders, ABEL (Analysis of Beam-beam
Eﬀects in Linear colliders), was developed [1]. The original ABEL included beam disrup-
tion and beamstrahlung [2] and was later modiﬁed (ABELMOD) [3] to include electron-
position pair creation which is potentially a serious source of background to the detector
[4].

For e−e−, e−γ and γγ colliders, a similar kind of simulation is necessary to understand
beam-beam interaction, but the situation is much more complicated due to the necessarily
complex schemes of the beam collision. In e−γ and γγ colliders, an intense laser beam
is ﬂashed on the incoming electron beam just before the interaction point to convert
high energy electron beam to high energy photon beam by Compton scattering [5]. A
simulation program for these colliders is required to implement laser-electron interaction
at the conversion point which is typically on the order of cm upstream from the interaction
point. In addition to the conversion point, the simulation of beam-beam interaction at the
interaction point is more complicated than in the e+e−collider case, since 1) the initial
state includes not only electrons and positron but also photons, 2) as a consequence
of Compton interaction at the conversion point, electron and photon beams have wider

spectrum in both energy and spatial distribution than those of e+e−colliders. According
to these features, it is necessary to develop a new simulation program for beam-beam
interaction. To meet this requirement, a project to write a new comprehensive beam-beam
simulation program named CAIN (Conglomerat d’ABEL et d’Interactions Non-lineares)
[4] was launched with the intention to include Compton and Breit-Wheeler processes
at conversion point, transport of particles from conversion point to interaction point
and interaction of all possible combinations of electrons/positrons and photons at the
interaction point. By using the Compton scattering part of CAIN, the eﬀect of Breit-
Wheeler process in a photon-photon collider is discussed in previous paper[5].

In this paper, we report the ﬁrst version of the comprehensive simulation program
which can treat conversion, transportation and interaction region in a single framework
and is applicable for handling of all 4 types of e+e−, e−e−, e−γ and γγ colliders. As
examples of the simulation, diﬀerential luminosity distribution of γγ , e−e−and e+e−option
of NLC is described.

2 Structure of CAIN (version 1.0)

A schematic of a γγ collider is illustrated in ﬁg.1. An intense laser pulse is ﬂashed on the
electron beam at the conversion point (CP) where high energy photon beams are produced
by Compton scattering. Photons and electrons coming out from CP are transported for
O(cm) to the interaction point (IP). At the transport region (TP), spent electrons from
CP may be swept out by an external magnetic ﬁeld or possibly plasma lens to avoid the
electron collision at the IP Electrons and photons that are transported to the IP collide
with positrons and photons from another beam.

Corresponding to the scheme of the γγ collider, simulations in CAIN are divided in
three modules CP, TP and IP as illustrated in ﬁg.2. In this ﬁgure, particles and processes
included in each step are shown as well.

At the CP, Compton and Breit-Wheeler interactions between laser and electron beams
are simulated. First of all, an electron bunch is divided into given number of macro
particles and initial position and momentum of each macro particle are calculated from
beam twiss parameters. In a typical linear collider, the number of electrons per bunch is
O(1010).

A typical simulation uses 10,000 macro particles, with each one representing O(106)
electrons. The transverse and longitudinal coordinates in the simulation space are subdi-
vided into cells and macro particles are assigned to these cells according to their position.
The time in the simulation is also divided into steps. In each time step, the probability
of Compton scattering is calculated for each macro particle according to the laser intensity,
and a Compton scattered photon is generated according to the probability. The local laser
intensity at each cell is calculated from given laser parameters by taking into account
diﬀraction eﬀect, i.e:,

4π(σL
λL

where λL is wave length of the laser. If the Compton scattering event is generated, the
new photon is created and momentum of the scattered electron is modiﬁed. Such an
electron can still interact with the laser in the following time steps.

As is described later, the primary consideration in selecting the laser parameters is
keeping the eﬀect of nonlinear QED processes to a minimum. However, it is impossible to
avoid such eﬀects completely when high luminosity is required. The nonlinear Compton
processes can be expressed as

e + nγ(laser)

e + γ

→

where nγ(laser) indicates that more than one laser photons are absorbed coherently
by a single electron. Since this process accounts for higher tails in scattered photon
spectrum and lowers peak energy of photon spectrum due to the increase of eﬀective
electron mass [6], it has to be kept small to get good photon beams. For the purpose
of γγ and e−γ collider application, proper treatment of helicity of electron and laser
beam is essential since produced photon energy spectrum depends on the helicity state
of incoming electrons and photons. In the simulation, cross section formula by Tsai [7]
is used in which the polarization of electrons and laser is taken into account in nonlinear
QED calculation. The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process can be written as

γ(Compton) + nγ(laser)

e+e−

→

where more than one laser photons are absorbed by (Compton scattered) high energy
photon and generate electron positron pairs. This process produces electron-positron
pairs even if the center of mass energy of γ(Compton)γ(laser) system is lower than e+e−
threshold and could be an additional source of backgrounds in high laser ﬁeld environment.
We also adopt the formula by Tsai [7] for this process.

The transport process takes care of drift of spent electrons, Compton photons and
electron positron pairs that come out from CP. Photons are simply drifted to IP according
to their angular divergence. For electrons and positrons, however, it is possible to insert a
sweeping magnet to deﬂect them from IP. In the version 1.0 of CAIN, a sweeping magnet
and synchrotron radiation in the sweeping process is included by a classical radiation
treatment. Since the strength of the sweeping magnetic ﬁeld is on the order of 1 Tesla,
the critical energy of synchrotron radiation is low enough to be treated as the classical
radiation. Synchrotron radiation photons are added to the total photon population to be
inputed to the interaction region.

IP phenomena are simulated in the same way as done in ABELMOD [1, 3]. In fact,
a reworked version of ABELMOD serves as an interaction region module in CAIN 1.0 to
simulate disruption of electron beams, generation of beamstrahlung, and production of low
energy pairs. The diﬀerence from ABELMOD is that CAIN needs to take care of mixture
of electrons/positrons and photons as its initial state, while only electron and positron
beams could be used in ABELMOD. Thus ABELMOD was modiﬁed to treat externally

every time step in the interaction region CAIN collects total and diﬀerential luminosities

after the simulation.

3 Case Study: γγ , e−e−Collisions in NLC

3.1

γγ Collisions

Simulations of γγ collisions were performed with the reference parameters for a γγ collider
option of NLC [9] summarized in Table 1.

Since the luminosity of photon-photon colliders is approximately proportional to the ge-
ometric luminosity and, unlike e+e− collider, there is no strong beamstrahlung at the
interaction, the higher geometric luminosity is preferable. Laser parameters are chosen so
that conversion eﬃciency of incoming electrons in a laser pulse is about 0.65. The peak

which is about 80% of the original beam energy.

The treatment of spent electrons coming out from the CP is one of the important issues
to be considered in γγ colliders. If these electrons collide with electrons and photons from
the other beam, beam-beam interaction at the IP generates low energy electron positron
pairs. These pairs are a possible source of detector background as in e+e− colliders [8]. In
this situation, luminosity of e−γ and e−e− collision is comparable to γγ luminosity which
could make physics analysis complicated. For this reason, it is desirable to install magnet
between CP and IP to sweep spent electrons away from IP. However, the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld is needed to be on the order of 1 Tesla for eﬀective deﬂection of electrons
and it is necessary to install the magnet in the very limited space (1cm) between CP and
IP.

In addition, the magnet must not interfere with precise measurement of vertex position
of, for example, b quark decay. To meet these, much research and development eﬀort is
necessary.

Using NLC simulation parameters, we consider two cases of interaction region geom-

etry – without the sweeping magnet between CP and IP, and with it.

Without the magnet, electron beams are collided with 1σy oﬀset so as to reduce

electron beam collision without signiﬁcantly deteriorating γγ luminosity.

combination of polarization of laser (Pγ) and electron (Pe) beams is chosen so that PγPe =

seen that the high energy peak of about 200GeV in linear Compton is shifted to a lower

The diﬀerential luminosity spectrum is shown in ﬁg.4 for linear and nonlinear Compton
calculations. In Lγγ distribution, high c.m.s energy contriubution is made by collision of
Compton photons. In the low energy region, a large low energy tail is seen in the spectrum.
The source of the tail is beamstrahlung, i.e., collisions of beamstrahlung photons with
beamstrahlung and Compton photons. With nonlinear calculation, high energy peak is
shifted to a lower value due to the shift in Compton photon spectrum, and the peak
becomes broader than the linear Compton case. γγ luminosity in high energy region
is about 8% of geometric luminosity and 10% in linear Compton calculation because of
the broadness of the high energy peak. The nonlinear eﬀect lowers the peak energy and
broadens the peak; however, with this set of parameters ξ2 = 0.4 and the eﬀect is not
very signiﬁcant and is at tolerable level. Obtained luminosities are summarized in Table
2.

Since there is an overlap of electron beams and of electron and photon beams at
the interaction point, some amount of Leγ and Lee is observed. From the experimental
point of view, the initial state of the interaction should be as simple as possible but
should provide high luminosities at the same time. These requirements are conﬂicting
and additional studies are needed to ﬁnd an optimum solution.

The luminosity distribution for the case with sweeping magnet is shown in ﬁg.5. The
simulation parameters of the electron and the laser beams are the same as in the case
without the sweeping magnet except for the distance between CP and IP: taking into
account comlications of installation of the magnet, CP is shifted to 10mm from the IP.
The strength of magnetic ﬁeld is 1 Tesla in x direction and 250GeV electron is swept
6σy) away in y direction from IP. As seen in ﬁg.5, e−γ and e−e− luminosities are
60nm(
signiﬁcantly reduced. Comparing with the non-sweeping magnet case, γγ luminosity is
expected to be reduced due to the enlargement of CP-IP distance while it gains a little bit
due to the absense of σy oﬀset. As a result, γγ luminosity is 6% of geomrtric luminosiry

3.2 Other applications
As the second case study, we applied the program to e+e− and e−e− collisions in NLC
conﬁguration listed in Table 3 with center-of-mass energy √S = 500GeV[9].

The calculated luminosity is shown in ﬁg.6. The total e+e− and e−e− luminosity is
1.42Lgeom and 0.55Lgeom respectively. As expected, the e+e− luminosity is enhanced by
the collective Coulomb interaction ( pinch eﬀect ) while the e−e− luminosity is reduced
to almost half of geometric luminosity due to repulsive coulomb interaction at the IP.

To simulate e−γ collider, the laser pulse should be aimed at one electron beam and the
other beam should be kept untouched. This simulation is easily set up by the combination
of γγ and e−e− parameters and the results are similar to γγ collider without the sweeping
magnet.

4 The Next Step: CAIN 2

4.1 Problem in CAIN1.0

As was demonstrated in the previous section, CAIN1.0 can be successfully used for the
simulations of general linear collider schemes, however there are some problems with the
structure of the program. The main problem comes from the fact that IP simulation of
CAIN1.0 is essentially the same as ABEL which was developed for pure e+e− simulation.
The IP simulation in CAIN1.0 assumes that each bunch in the initial state consists
of a single kind of particle – electron or positron with possible mixture of photons. (For
example, the same distribution is used for particle distribution to calculate luminosity
and for charge distribution to calculate the beam ﬁeld.) Although electron positron pairs
are created in CP by Breit-Wheeler process, the information on the pair particle species is

7

ignored in the IP simulation. For most of γγ collider parameters, Breit-Wheeler process
in CP is kept small and neglecting pair species does not aﬀect the simulation signiﬁcantly.
However, in the case of high laser intensity or high x, large number of electron positron
pairs are created at CP and their contribution should not be ignored in the IP simulation.
It is implicitly assumed in CAIN1.0 that the initial energies of electrons/positrons are
more or less in the same energy range. However, in the case of γγ colliders the energy
just before IP has a wide spread from the full energy down to a few percent. This fact
makes the various formulas (for example the integration of equation of motion) adopted
In this respect the incoherent pair particles, whose
in CAIN1.0 somewhat inaccurate.
energy can be much lower, have no problem because they are treated in a diﬀerent way.
However, in fact the spent electrons and the incoherent pair particles form an energy
spectrum almost continuous from a few MeV to hundreds of GeV. In this sense there is
no reason to treat the incoherent pair particles on a diﬀerent footing.

The orbit angles of incoherent pair particles can be as large as hundred milliradians.
Nevertheless, CAIN1.0 assumes that the z-component of the velocity is equal to the
velocity of light. This fact makes the orbit calculation somewhat unreliable but it is very
hard to modify this point in the framework of CAIN1.0.

There is another problem which is common for both CP and IP simulations. As men-
tioned, the simulation is performed by macro particles each of which represents, typically,
O(106) real particles. If one is interested in the eﬀect of smaller number of particles, say,
O(103), a very large number of macro particles is needed for such a run. This drastically
aﬀects program speed and required storage. There are several ways to avoid this, how-
ever. One can populate certain regions of the beam (the halo, for instance) with macro
particles with reduced weight, thus enhancing resolution only in the regions of interest.
Also, the analysis of “light-weight” macro particle behavior can be done after the collec-
tive ﬁelds have been calculated, thus neglecting the contribution of these particles to the
ﬁeld. These methods are not implemented in CAIN1.0.

4.2 CAIN2 Project

In order to overcome the problems stated above, the simulation program CAIN2 has been
written from scratch because the code and memory structure of ABELMOD were not
adequate for further extension. The major diﬀerences of the structure of the new version
CAIN2 are

•

•

All the particles (electron/positron/photon, initial or secondary, etc) are stored in
the same array and treated on equal basis. (Laser beams are not treated as particles:
they are ‘external ﬁelds’ like the ﬁeld of magnets.)

Instead of invoking separate programs, various interactions such as laser-Compton,
beam-beam interaction and beam transport are processed one by one at every time
step in one program, if their ﬂags are on. This will enable to add new interactions,
such as plasma, which may take place simultaneously with other interactions.

•

The new user interface allows much more variety of the conﬁgurations of the beams
and interactions so that applications other than linear colliders may be possible.

8

For example, one can prepare a neutral beam of mixed e+e−, a bunch consisting of
many bunchlets, etc.

The basic assumption in CAIN1.0 is that the collision of the two beams is collinear,
meaning that the crossing angle is very small and that each of the two beams, right-going
and left-going, is a well-deﬁned beam, i.e., the mutual angles between the constituents
are reasonably small. Without this assumption the calculation of the beam-beam force
would be very complex.

This requirement has also been adopted in CAIN2 but it is relaxed in two respects.
Firstly, small samples of particles (such that their contribution to the beam ﬁeld is negli-
gible) can have large angles. This is relevant for incoherent pair particles. Secondly, the
right-going and left-going beams can make large angles so long as each beam is well colli-
mated. CAIN2 introduces Lorentz transformation to make the collision collinear. Thus,
a large crossing angle can be correctly treated.

The latest version of CAIN2, which is to be completed soon, includes the following

interactions:

1. Beam deformation by classical ﬁeld (mainly the beam ﬁeld)

2. Quantum-theoretical synchrotron radiation (beamstrahlung)

3. Coherent pair creation (this was missing in CAIN1.0)
4. Linear interaction of lasers with e−, e+, γ.
5. Nonlinear interaction of lasers with e−, e+, γ.
6. Particle-particle interactions such as the incoherent pair creation and bremsstrahlung.

Now, all the processes in CP, TP, and IP can be treated by one program. They can be
done in a single job or partitioned into separate jobs.

Since the polarization is very important in various applications, it is included in most
of the above interactions. For example, (1) in the above list includes precession in mag-
netic ﬁelds, (2), (3), (4) include all possible polarizations, and (5) includes longitudinal
polarization of all the particles, initial and ﬁnal.

In order to overcome the statistical problem of rare events, most interactions now have
the ‘event enhancement factor’. For some interactions it is also possible to enhance the
rate of some part of the spectrum so that, for example, one can create more low-energy
macro particles (with less weight).

5 Summary

We developed a simulation program for phenomena in the interaction regions of linear
colliders which allow us to estimate realistic luminosity distributions and detector back-
grounds. This simulation program can be used for various types of linear colliders such
as γγ , e−γ , e−e−, and e+e− by just switching input parameter.

This program was used for a photon-photon collider option of the NLC and a realistic
luminosity distribution was obtained. It was also found that nonlinear QED eﬀect is not
negligible in typical parameters for a γγ collider. Since particle physics issues as well as

9

amounts of background events depend on the luminosity distribution, it gives us useful
information for further study.

cussions. Two of the authors (T.T. and T.O.) thank Prof. I. Endo for his encouragement.

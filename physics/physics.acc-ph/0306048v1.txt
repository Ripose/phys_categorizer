IMPEDANCES OF TEVATRON SEPARATORS

K.Y. Ng,∗ FNAL, Batavia, IL 60510, USA

Abstract

The impedances of the Tevatron separators are revisited
and are found to be negligibly small in the few hundred
MHz region, except for resonances at 22.5 MHz. The latter
are contributions from the power cables which may drive
head-tail instabilities if the bunch is long enough.

I. INTRODUCTION

∼

Large chromaticities (

12 units) were required to con-
trol the vertical transverse head-tail instabilities observed
recently in the Tevatron. Application of the head-tail
growth expression [1] reveals that the necessary transverse
impedance to drive such instabilities has to be at least
twice the amount estimated in the Run II Handbook. [2]
This underestimation becomes thrice when it was sug-
gested [3] that the transverse impedance of the Lambert-
son magnets have been overestimated by ten fold.1 It was
further suggested that most of the transverse impedance
the vertical
actually comes from the static separators:
transverse impedance should be 5.33 MW
/m assuming 27
separators while the Run II Handbook estimate has been
only 0.082 MW
/m assuming 11 separators.2 This 26-time
difference for each separator prompts us to review the
impedances in detail by numerical computation, theoreti-
cal reasoning, and experimental measurement. The conclu-
sion points to the fact that the separators actually contribute
negligibly when compared with other discontinuities in the
Tevatron vacuum chamber, except for the rather large reso-
nances at 22.5 MHz due to the power cables.

II. NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS
We model a separator without the power cables as two
plates 6 cm thick, 20 cm wide, 2.57 m long, separated by
5 cm inside a circular chamber of length 2.75 m and ra-
dius 18 cm (Fig. 1). The beam pipe is circular in cross
section with radius 4 cm. The 3-D code MAFIA in the
time domain [4] has been used to obtain the longitudinal
and transverse impedances shown in Fig. 2. We ﬁnd that,
at low frequencies, the longitudinal impedance per har-
monic and the vertical transverse impedance are, respec-
and ZV
tively, Zk0 /n
/m, which
agree with the estimates given in the Run II Handbook.

In many cases, a 2-D approximation, assuming cylindri-
cal symmetry of the 3-D problem, should give us a good
insight as to the physics of the problem. The advantage is
obvious; we can use more mesh points to better represent
the geometry. The ﬁrst 50 resonant modes computed by

the 2-D URMEL code [4] are shown in Fig. 3 (top). They
are well below the cutoff frequency of 4.59 GHz and there-
fore appear as narrow resonances. The separator can be
viewed as two pill-box cavities joined by a coaxial waveg-
uide. The coaxial waveguide resonates when its length
equals to an integral number of half wavelengths. Thus,
the lowest mode has a frequency of c/(2ℓ) = 54.5 MHz and
successive modes are separated also by 54.5 MHz, where c
is the velocity of light and ℓ = 2.75 m is the length of sep-
arator. To excite these standing TEM modes in the coax-
ial waveguide, electromagnetic ﬁelds must penetrate into
the separator, and penetration is only efﬁcient when the
frequency is near the resonant frequencies of the cavities
at each end of the separator. These pill-box-like cavities
have a radial depth of d = 18 cm with the ﬁrst resonance
at 637 MHz, and we do see coaxial-guide modes excited
very much stronger near this frequency. The next pill-box-
cavity mode is at 1463 MHz with a radial node at 7.84 cm

which is very near the outer radius of 8.5 cm of the cylin-
drical plates. Thus a rather pure cavity mode is excited
with very little contamination from the coaxial guide. This
explains why we see a very strong excitation of this mode
without many coaxial-guide modes at nearby frequencies.
The third pill-box-cavity mode at 2294 MHz can also be
seen in the ﬁgure with coaxial-guide modes at surrounding
frequencies. Because excitation decreases with frequency,
the shunt impedances are much smaller.

Due to the ﬁnite mesh size and rms bunch length used
in the computation, MAFIA broadens all these sharp reso-
nances. If all quality factors are broadened to Q = 15, the
results look very similar to those in Fig. 2, implying that
our interpretation of the longitudinal impedance of the sep-
arator is correct.

Similar analysis applies to the transverse dipole modes.
The lowest 50 resonances computed by URMEL are shown
in Fig. 3 (bottom). The ﬁrst two transverse resonances
in the pill-box cavities are 1016, 1860 MHz. We do
see coaxial-guide modes enhanced near these frequencies.
There is a special mode when one wavelength of the mag-
netic ﬁeld wraps around the “cylindrical plate” between the
plate and the encasing outer shield. The radius is from
r = 8.5 to 18 cm. The wavelength will be l = 2p r and
the frequency will be between 265 and 562 MHz. This ex-
plains the cluster of low-frequency coaxial-guide modes in
the URMEL results. There is no cylindrical symmetry in
the actual separator and this low-frequency cluster is there-
fore not present in the MAFIA results. Again if we broaden
the sharp resonances until the quality factor reaches 15, the
real and imaginary parts of the transverse impedance will
look similar to the MAFIA results of Fig. 2.

III. COMPARISON WITH BPM
Although the Tevatron stripline beam-position monitor
(BPM) is similar in structure to the separator, however, its
impedance is completely different. Here, the striplines play
the role of the separator plates. The main difference is that
each end of the striplines is terminated with a resistor of
Zc = 50 W
, which is equal to the characteristic impedance
of the transmission line formed from the stripline and the
enclosing outer shield. As a pulse of protons crosses the up-
stream gap, it creates on the beam-side of the stripline neg-
ative image charges, which move forward with the beam
pulse. Since the stripline is neutral, positive charges will
be created at the underside of the stripline. These positive
charges, seeing a termination Zc in parallel with a trans-
mission line of characteristic impedance Zc, split into two
equal halves: one half ﬂows down the termination while
the other half travels along the transmission line and ﬂows
down the termination Zc at the other end of the stripline.
When the beam pulse crosses the downstream gap of the
BPM, the negative image charges on the beam-side of the
stripline wrap into the underside of the stripline; one half
ﬂows down the downstream termination while the other
half ﬂows backward along the transmission line and even-
tually down the upstream termination. Assuming the trans-
mission line velocity to be the same as the beam veloc-
ity, the current in the downstream termination vanishes be-
tween one half of the stripline underside positive charges
and one half of the wrap-around negative image charges.
At the upstream termination, we see ﬁrst a positive signal
followed by a negative signal delayed by twice the tran-
sit time of traveling along the stripline. Thus the potential
across the upstream gap is

V (t) =

Zc [I0(t)

I0(t

2ℓ/c)] ,

(1)

−

where ℓ is the length of the stripline and I0(t) is the beam
current. The factor 1
2 occurs because only one half of the
current ﬂows down the upstream termination each time.
The impedance of one stripline in the BPM becomes
f 0
2p (cid:19)
where f 0 is the angle the stripline subtends at the beam
pipe axis. The added factor, [f 0/(2p )]2, indicates that only
a fraction of the image current ﬂows across the gap into the
stripline and only this fraction sees a gap potential.

For a separator plate, there are no terminations on either
end. As a result, while the negative image charges ﬂow
along the beam-side of the plate, all the positive charges
needed to balance the neutrality of the plate ﬂow along the
underside of the plate. These negative and positive charges
just annihilate each other when the beam pulse reaches the
downstream end of the plate. Thus there is no dissipation
if the plates are considered perfectly conducting. There-
fore, the impedance in Eq. (2) does not apply. The only
contribution to the impedance come from the resonances in
the cavity gaps. Since these resonant frequencies are high,
there is little contribution in the few hundred MHz range.

IV. MEASUREMENT
The coupling impedances of a separator have recently
been measured [5] via the attenuation S21 by stretching a
0.010′′ tin-plated copper wire through the separator for the
longitudinal mode and two wires for the transverse mode.
The impedances are derived from

tain the resonant structures determined by MAFIA and are
small in the few hundred MHz region. However, we do
see a large resonance at 22.5 MHz, which can be traced
to coaxial power cables attached about 12 1
′′ from one end
2
of the plate through a 50 W
resistor. Typically, the cables
are two-meter long and terminate into a 1 MW
impedance.
These cables extend the electric lengths of the plates and
the ﬁrst waveguide mode is shifted from 54.5 MHz to
22.5 MHz. The function of the series 50 W
resistor is to
remove any sparks if present. Actually, this resistor, be-
ing situated near the end of a plate, absorbs the oscilla-
tory current of this resonant mode. Without this resistor,
the 22.5-MHz peak in both Zk0/n and ZV
1 will be almost
tripled. On the other hand, these peaks will disappear if the
power cables are removed. There are 24 separators, giving

are rather large. The longest Tevatron bunch has been
√6s ℓ, the lowest head-
s ℓ = 95 cm rms. Considering
tail mode will have a frequency of c/(4√6s ℓ) = 32 MHz.
Thus this 22.5 MHz mode may pose a danger. There are
ways to alleviate the effect. One is to increase the length
of the power cables so as to further reduce the resonant
frequency. A second way is to increase the damping resis-
tors to about 500 W
, [5] hoping that the peak impedances
will be damped by a factor of ten. The designed Tevatron
rms bunch length is only s ℓ = 37 cm. If this shorter bunch
length can be achieved, the lowest head-tail mode will have
a frequency of 82.8 MHz, too high to be affected by the
power cables.

which gives the large estimate cited earlier in the Intro-
duction. The wake resembles the stripline BPM wake [cf
Eq. (1)] with a reﬂected current at the downstream end of
the separator plate. As we have discussed earlier, there
is no reﬂected current because the positive and negative
charges created on the plate annihilate when the beam pulse
crosses the downstream separator gap. An outer shield
is very essential for a separator model, because a waveg-
uide/transmission line will be formed. For the BPM, the
transmission line characteristic impedance Zc enters into
the impedance expression of Eq. (2). Without the trans-
mission line, here in Eq. (6), the much larger free-space
impedance Z0 enters instead.

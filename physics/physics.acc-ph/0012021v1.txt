Peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions uniquely probe many aspects of QED.
Examples include e+e− pair production and nuclear excitation in strong ﬁelds. Af-
ter discussing these reactions, I will draw parallels between γ
qq
and consider partly hadronic reactions. The scattered qq pairs are a proliﬁc source
of vector mesons, which demonstrate many quantum eﬀects. The two ions are a
two-source interferometer, demonstrating interference between meson waves. Mul-
tiple vector meson production will demonstrate superradiance, a ﬁrst step toward
a vector meson laser. Finally, I will discuss the experimental program planned at
the RHIC and LHC heavy ion colliders.

1 Introduction

Heavy ion collisions might seem like a strange topic for an accelerator physics
conference. However, many topics of interest to accelerator physicists also
occur in peripheral heavy ion collisions. In these collisions, the ions do not
physically collide. Instead, they interact electromagnetically at long ranges,
up to hundreds of fermi. Relativistic heavy ions carry extremely strong elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds, allowing tests of nonperturbative electrodynamics. These
ﬁelds are strong enough to allow for multiple reactions involving a single pair
of ions, so quantum ﬂuctuations and superluminous emission can be studied.
Even for single particle production, quantum interference aﬀects the vector
meson spectrum. All of these topics have parallels in advanced accelerator
design. And, some aspects of heavy ion interactions impact directly on ac-
celerator design. This writeup will review the physics of peripheral heavy ion
collisions, with an emphasis on principles. Mathematical and experimental
details are left to the references.

Several diﬀerent types of peripheral reactions are possible. The two nuclei
may exchange one or more photons (Fig 1a). One or both nuclei may be excited

into a Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) or higher state. Or, the photon may
interact with a single nucleon in the nucleus in an incoherent photonuclear
interaction.

Two ﬁelds may interact with each other.

In a two-photon interaction,
each nucleus emits a photon. The two photons collide to produce a leptonic
or hadronic ﬁnal state, as in Fig. 1b. The ﬁelds are so strong that ‘two-
photon’ is a misnomer- the number of photons from one nucleus may be large,
and, in fact, poorly deﬁned. A photon from one nucleus may interact with
the coherent meson or Pomeron ﬁelds of the other. Although this reaction has
some similarities with incoherent photonuclear interactions, coherence restricts
the ﬁnal state kinematics, so reactions involving two coherent ﬁelds produce
kinematically similar ﬁnal states.

Here, we (by deﬁnition) require that the two nuclei physically miss each
other and do not interact hadronically. The impact parameter b > 2RA, RA
being the nuclear radius. More detailed calculation will calculate and use the
non-interaction probability as a function of b.

In the nuclear rest frame, a photon, Pomeron or meson coupling coherently
to a nucleus must have p < ¯hc/RA. More precisely, the coupling is governed

A*

by the nuclear form factor. In a collider where each nucleus is Lorentz boosted
by γ, this coupling transforms to p⊥ < ¯hc/RA and photon energy k = p|| <
γ¯hc/RA. So, two-ﬁeld interactions can occur up to a maximum energy W =
2γ¯hc/RA, with a ﬁnal state p⊥ < 2¯hc/RA. For photons, p⊥ is actually smaller,
peaked at p⊥ < ¯hc/b.

Two-photon, photon-Pomeron/meson and double-Pomeron/meson reac-
tions are all possible. Double-Pomeron/meson interactions are limited to a
narrow range of impact parameter because of the short range of the strong
force. Therefore, they will occur with a relatively low cross section. They will
also have a quite diﬀerent p⊥ spectrum. The p⊥ spectral diﬀerence will allow
some statistical separation between two-photon and photon-Pomeron interac-
tions.

For most applications, the electromagnetic ﬁelds of ultra-relativistic nuclei
may be treated as a ﬁeld of virtual photons, following Weizs¨acker-Williams.

Since Pomerons and mesons are short-ranged, photon-Pomeron and pho-

For photo-nuclear interactions, the maximum photon energy seen by one nu-
cleus is strongly boosted, by Γ = 2γ2 − 1, or 20,000 for RHIC and 1.5 × 107
for LHC. Thus, the photon energies reach 600 GeV with gold at RHIC, and
500 TeV for lead at the LHC; with lighter nuclei, these numbers are 2-3 times
higher.

Fixed target heavy ion accelerators can produce e+e− pairs, with and
without capture; heavier states are not energetically accessible. These reactions
have been studied at the LBL Bevalac, BNL AGS and CERN SPS. Studies
of hadroproduction is just beginning at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN; these colliders are energetic enough to produce a variety of ﬁnal
states. The characteristics of these colliders are shown in Table 1.

Peripheral collisions have recently been reviewed by Baur, Hencken and

Trautmann 3.

2 Nuclear Excitation and Incoherent Photonuclear Interactions

For low energy photons, nuclear excitations are typically collective. For exam-
ple, in a Giant Dipole Resonance, the protons oscillate in one direction and the
neutrons in the other. This vector oscillation can be induced by a single pho-
ton. Higher excitations include double (or higher) Giant Dipole Resonances,

higher n states of a harmonic oscillator. There are also Giant Quadrupole
Resonances, which require multiple photons to produce. These states typically
decay by emitting one or more neutrons which can be detected in far-forward
calorimeters.

These reactions are of interest for a couple of reasons. As Table 2 shows,
the cross sections are substantial 4. Nuclear excitation is a substantial contrib-
utor to beam loss. The photon carries little momentum, so nuclear excitation
creates a beam of particles with unchanged momentum but altered charge
to mass ratio 5. This beam will escape the magnetic optics and strike the
beampipe at a relatively well deﬁned point downstream, locally heating the
magnets. This heating could cause superconducting magnets to quench. Also,
this beam could be extracted from the accelerator, for ﬁxed target use.

A single photon can excite both the emitting and target nuclei, although
the cross section is smaller than for single excitation. This double process
is signiﬁcant for a couple of reasons.
It has a clean signature and is useful
as a luminosity monitor 6. Second, it can tag small b events. To a good
approximation, the nuclear excitation photon factorizes from the remainder of
the interaction 7, as is shown in Fig. 1(d). Thus the nuclear excitation can tag
collisions at low b.

3 Two-Photon Interactions

Two-photon interactions have been studied extensively at e+e− colliders. Pho-
tons couple to charge, so two-photons couplings measure the internal charge
content of mesons; qq pairs are produced, but not charge-free states like glue-
balls. Hybrids (qqg) and 4-quark states (qqqq) are produced at intermediate
rates. Thus, coupling to two-photons is a sensitive test for exotic mesons.

Meson pair production rates depend on the pair energy. Near threshold,
charged meson pairs (π+π−) are produced, but neutral pairs (π0π0) are not.
At higher energies, the photons see the quark structure of mesons, and both

charged and neutral mesons are produced.

Two-photon interactions at heavy ion colliders are of interest because that
the luminosity scales as Z 4 and extremely high rates are possible. Figure 2
compares the γγ luminosities at RHIC, with the LEP and CESR e+e− col-
liders 8; for W < 1.5 GeV, RHIC can reach the highest presently available
two-photon luminosities. Heavy ion colliders also probe some unique areas,
such as multiple pair production, and bound-free pair production; both are
probes of strong ﬁeld QED.

3.1 Lepton Pair Production

Lepton pair production can test the limits of perturbative QED. Perturbation
theory may fail because the coupling Aα is so large. Even with perturbative
approaches, e+e− production introduces additional complications. The elec-
tron Compton wavelength, Λe=386 fm, is large compared to typical impact
parameters. So at W ∼ 2me, where the bulk of the cross section is, the pair
production is poorly localized.

The ﬁrst perturbative calculation speciﬁc to heavy ion collisions was by
Bottcher and Strayer 9. They treated the ions as sources of classical (but
relativistic) electromagnetic potentials that follow ﬁxed trajectories. This
approach naturally incorporated oﬀ-shell photons. This calculation also ac-
counted for large electron Compton radius Λe = 386 fermi, with an appropriate
cutoﬀ. In the two-photon approach, Λe should replace the minimum impact

6

g
g
parameter, RA ∼ 7 fermi, in Eq. 2. This reduces the cross section signiﬁcantly
compared to earlier calculations.

A slightly later, more reﬁned calculation by Baur and Bertulani included
Coulomb corrections, to account for the fact that the pair is produced deep in
a Coulomb potential 10. With this reﬁnement, the cross section is given by

where me is the electron mass, δ = 0.681 is Euler’s constant and f = (Zα)2
n=1[n(n2 + Z 2α2)]−1 is the usual Coulomb correction. The ln3 term dom-
Σ∞
inates at high energy. Other authors have found slightly diﬀerent results,
depending on the details of the calculation.

Baur and Bertulani also calculated the probability of pair production at
a given b. With gold at RHIC, this probability is greater than 1 for b = Λe!
The diﬀerential cross section dσ/2πbdb saturates. The problem is resolved by
multiple pair production: a single ion pair small-b confrontation can produce
more than one pair. The the number of pairs is Poisson distributed, with the
b-dependent mean 11. This saturation can also aﬀect calculations of the single
pair cross section.

Numerous authors have considered non-perturbative e+e− production,
usually using the time-dependent Dirac equation. Some authors solved the
coupled-channel equations numerically. The ions were stepped through their
positions. At each step, the coupling from the initial state to a pair-containing
ﬁnal states was calculated. An accurate calculation requires a complete and
orthogonal set of states. This turned out to be rather diﬃcult, and early
calculations found results that varied by orders of magnitude.

Baltz and McLerran calculated pair production to all orders 12. Their
method is similar to the perturbative calculation. They worked in light-cone
coordinates with Lienard-Wiechert potentials similar to those of Bottcher &
Streyer. They ﬁrst found the Greens function for the exact wave function at
the interaction point. The transition amplitude was then constructed from
the Greens function. The total cross section is this amplitude, integrated
over impact parameter and intermediate transverse momentum. Their result
matches the perturbative result (without Coulomb corrections).

Recently, Roman Lee and A. Milstein found a problem with the order of
integration in the Baltz and McLerran paper 13. When the order changed, Lee
and Milstein the result changed to include the Coulomb correction found by
Baur & Bertulani (the f term in Eq. 5).

The agreement with perturbation theory is somewhat surprising, given
the large coupling. However, Baltz and McLerran found that, for multiple

7

pair production, their result was smaller than the perturbative result. Since
multiple pair production is naturally a higher order process, it’s not surprising
that a diﬀerence appears.

A related reaction is bound-free pair production where the electron is pro-
duced bound to one of the nuclei. As with free pairs, perturbative calculations
may be inadequate, and an exact solution to the time-dependent Dirac equa-
tion is desired. This problem has also been tackled perturbatively; here the
ﬁnal state consists of a free positron and an electron in an atomic orbital. The
cross section to produce an electron bound in an atomic K− shell is 3

The stronger Z dependence comes from the electron-nucleus binding energy.
Inclusion of higher shells will increase this by about 20%. This cross section
has the form σ = A ln(γ)+B. Extrapolations from lower energy data using this
form ﬁnd a cross section about twice as large 14. Coupled-channel calculations
have been tried on this problem, and produced a wide range of results. Also, as
with free-production, an all-order solution to the time-dependent Dirac equa-
tion has recently been found, again using light-cone coordinates 15. The result
was slightly lower than perturbation theory. The cross section for bound-free
production is much lower than for free production, so that dσ/2πbdb is not
saturated.

The 1-electron atoms produced in this reaction have their momentum un-
changed, so that they will follow well-deﬁned trajectories. As with nuclear
excitation, this can lead to heating of the accelerator magnets and also allow
for extracted beams 5.

In principle, these non-perturbative aspects of pair production also apply
to µ+µ− and τ +τ − production. However, the masses are much larger, so any
non-perturbative eﬀects are much smaller. Because mµ > ¯h/RA, Eq. 2 applies
for heavy lepton production.

4 qq ﬂuctuations and Vector Meson Production

The vacuum ﬂuctuation γ → qq is similar to γ → e+e−; only the ﬁnal state
charges and masses are diﬀerent. Just as the virtual e+e− pair can interact
with an external Coulomb ﬁeld and become real, the qq pair can interact with
an external nuclear ﬁeld and emerge as real vector meson 16.

This picture is clearest in the target rest frame. The incoming photon has
a high momentum, and the ﬂuctuation persists for a time τf = ¯h/M , during
which it travels a distance known as the formation distance lf = 2¯hk/M 2. In

8

alternate language, lf = ¯h/p||, where p|| is the momentum transfer required to
make the pair real. For e+e− pairs, lf is typically much larger than a single
atom; for qq pairs, lf is typically much larger than a single nucleus. So, the
ﬂuctuation cannot see the target structure. During it’s lifetime, the ﬂuctuation
can interact with the external ﬁeld to become a real pair.

The qq scatters elastically from the a nucleus with atomic number A. This
scattering is mediated by the strong force and transfers enough momentum
to give the meson its mass. The scattering leaves the photon quantum num-
bers J P C unchanged. This elastic scattering cannot easily be described in
terms of quarks and gluons. The most successful description is in terms of
the Pomeron 17. For hard processes the Pomeron may be thought of as a
2-gluon (quasi-bound) ladder, connected by gluon rungs. However, for soft
processes such as elastic scattering, this picture may be inappropriate. For
soft reactions, the best picture is the 40-year old soft-Pomeron diﬀractive pic-
ture 18. The Pomeron absorbs part of the photon wave function, allowing a qq
to emerge dominant.

In this model, the cross section for the reaction A + A → A + A + V
may be calculated in a straightforward manner. The starting point is data
on γ + p → V + p from ﬁxed target experiments and HERA. The forward
scattering amplitudes may be parameterized dσ/dt|t=0 = bv(XW ǫ + Y W −η),
where t is the 4-momentum transfer from the nucleus and here W is the γp
center of mass energy. The ﬁrst term, with ǫ ∼ 0.22, is for Pomeron exchange,
while the second is for meson exchange; Pomeron exchange dominates at high
energies. This amplitude factorizes into two parts: the γ → qq amplitude and
the elastic scattering amplitude. The ﬁrst part can be determined from the
partial width for V → e+e−, allowing vector meson production data to ﬁx
the scattering amplitude. Vector meson dominance allows us to treat the qq
ﬂuctuation as a real vector meson. The optical theorem can be used to ﬁnd
the total V p cross section.

The total V A cross section may be found with a Glauber calculation.
This calculation integrates over the transverse plane, summing the probability
of having 1 or more interactions:

σtot(V A) =

Z

d2~r

1 − e−σtot(V p)TAA(~r)
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(7)

where TAA(~r) is the nuclear thickness function. These cross sections rise with
W at low energies, then level oﬀ at an almost constant value.

The optical theorem is used to ﬁnd dσ/dt|t=0 for the meson -nucleus scat-
tering. Finally, the leptonic width is used to ﬁnd the forward amplitude for
vector meson production. In the small-σ limit, σtot(V p)TAA(b = 0) ≪ 1, the

9

forward amplitude scales as A2. This limit applies for heavy systems such as
cc. As σtot(V p) rises, the A−dependence decreases, and for large σtot(V p), the
scaling is A4/3, with the vector meson seeing the front face of the nucleus.
The total photonuclear cross section is given by an integration over t:

where tmin = M 2

F (t) may be ﬁt analytically by a convolution of a hard sphere with a Yukawa
potential.

Eq. 8 agrees well with data from ﬁxed target experiments. The total cross

section is

σ(A + A → A + A + V ) = 2

σ(γA → V A).

The factor of 2 is because either nuclei can act as target or emitter. These
cross sections are given in Table 2.

The implications of this straightforward calculation are signiﬁcant. The
cross sections are huge. With gold at RHIC, ρ0 production is 10% of the total
hadronic cross section. With lead at LHC, the ρ0 cross section is about equal
to the hadronic cross section! Heavy ion colliders can act as vector meson
factories, with rates comparable to e+e− vector meson machines. The 1010 φ
produced in 106 seconds with calcium beams at LHC is comparable to that
expected at a dedicated φ factory. Searches for rare decay modes, CP violation
and the like are possible. Also, vector meson spectroscopy will be productive;
mesons like the ρ(1450), ρ(1700) and φ(1680) will be copiously produced.

Fully coherent ﬁnal states will be distinctive. The ﬁnal state p⊥ is a con-
volution of the photon and Pomeron p⊥. Figure 3 shows these contributions.
The mean p⊥ from the photon is ¯h/b, considerably smaller than ¯h/RA.

This approach can also ﬁnd the vector meson rapidity distribution. The
ﬁnal state rapidity y = 1/2 ln(MV /k). So, dσ/dy = k/2dσ/dk and can be
determined from Eq. 9. The photon can come from either direction, so the
total σ(y) includes contributions for photons from +y and −y. dσ/dy is shown
in Fig. 4.

4.1

Interference

The observed p⊥ spectrum is more complicated than Fig. 3 shows. Either
nucleus can emit the photon. The two possibilities are indistinguishable, and

therefore, they interfere. In essence, the two nuclei act as a two-source inter-
ferometer. The two possible emitters are related by a parity transformation.
Vector mesons are negative parity so the two possibilities contribute with op-
posite signs, producing destructive interference 19. The cross section is

σ(p⊥, y, b) = A2(p⊥, y, b) + A2(p⊥, −y, b)

− 2A(p⊥, y, b)A(p⊥, −y, b) cos(φ(y) − φ(−y) + ~p⊥ · ~b)

(10)

where A(p⊥, −y, b) is the production amplitude and φ(y) is the production
phase. A may be found from the previous section. For pure Pomeron exchange,
the production is almost real. The production phase always cancels at y = 0,
and cancels everywhere unless φ depends on k. Variation is likely with the ρ
and ω because of the meson contribution. For other mesons, it is likely to be
small or negligible.

For a given b, σ oscillates with period ∆p⊥ = ¯h/b. When p⊥b < ¯h, the inter-
ference is destructive and there is little emission. The mean b for ρ production
at RHIC is about 40 fermi, rising to 300 fermi at LHC.

The impact parameter is unmeasured, so it is necessary to integrate over
all b. This dilutes the interference, except for p⊥ < ¯h/hbi. Figure 5 shows the
expected p⊥ spectrum with and without interference.

The mean impact parameter for ρ production with gold at RHIC is 40
fermi, far larger than the rho decay distance γβcτ < 1 fermi. The vector

mesons decay before their wave functions can overlap! However, the decay
product do overlap and interfere. The angular distributions for the two ρ0
sources are the same, so the interference pattern is not aﬀected. This process
requires a non-local wave function. Consider ρ0 → π+π−, with b ∼ 40 fermi.
Before the π+ waves from the 2 sources can overlap, they must travel ∼ 20
fermi each, during which time the π− waves will travel 20 fermi in the opposite
direction, and the π+ and π− waves will be separated by 40 fermi. So, non-
locality is required to produce this interference pattern.

Although there is as yet no counterpart to Bell’s inequality, the choice of
quantum observable does matter for this system. Consider a system where
b is measured. For the π+ and π−, one can measure either the momentum

or position.

values of π− momentum where destructive interference is complete.
If the
positions of both π are measured, the production point can be determined, but
the interference disappears. If one position and one momentum are observed,
neither the interference pattern nor the production point can be determined.

where ~x is where the vector meson would be if it didn’t decay; in the vector
meson rest frame ~x = 1/2(~x+ + ~x−) where ~x+ and ~x− are the position for
the π+ and π−, and ~k+ and ~k+ their momenta. This wave function cannot be
factorized: Ψ(π+π−) 6= Ψ(π+)Ψ(π−). Since the π+ and π− are well separated,
the wave function is non-local. This system is thus an example of the Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen paradox.

4.2 Multiple Vector Meson Production

The vector meson production probability at a given b may be calculated with
the impact-parameter dependent photon ﬂux. This is shown in Fig. 6. At
b = 2R, the probability of ρ0 production is 1% at RHIC, rising to 3% at LHC.
These probabilities are high enough that multiple meson production should be
observable. In the absence of quantum or other correlations, multiple meson
production should be independent and Poisson distributed. At b = 2R, the
ρ0ρ0 probabilities are (1%)2/2 and (3%)2/2 at RHIC and LHC respectively.
After integration over b, 1.4 million ρ0ρ0 are expected per year at RHIC. Like
meson triples should also be produced in observable numbers. Vector mesons
are bosons so production of like-meson pairs should be enhanced for momentum
diﬀerences δp < ¯h/RA. The meson follows the photon spin and can be aligned
or anti-aligned with the beam direction, so the enhancement is only 50%, so
N(pair)∼= 1 + 0.5 exp(δpRA/¯h).

5 Experimental Status

Fixed target measurements have been published for pair production, with and
without capture, and nuclear excitation. Due to space limitations, this writeup
will only consider relativistic collisions, with Γ > 10. The solid targets, with
the nuclei surrounded by their electron clouds, diﬀer from the stripped ion
collisions we focus on here. Measurements of pair production in sulfur on
heavy ion collisions around Γ = 160 have matched theoretical predictions 20.
Pair production with capture has also been studied with lead beams 14. As was
previously mentioned, when scaled to RHIC and LHC energies, this data may
exceed current estimates. However, corrections may be needed for the limited
boost of the current experiments.

Programs to study a variety of peripheral reactions are underway in the
STAR collaboration at RHIC and the CMS collaboration at LHC. For most

reactions, the largest backgrounds are expected to be grazing hadronic colli-
sions, beam gas interactions, and incoherent photonuclear interactions 8. For
triggering, debris from upstream interactions, and cosmic ray muons can be
important.

These backgrounds can be separated from the signals by selecting events
with low multiplicity, typically, 2 or 4, low total p⊥, and zero net charge.
Baryon number and strangeness must also be conserved.

At the trigger level, signiﬁcant rejection can be achieved by requiring that
the event originate inside the interaction region; this removes most of the beam
gas events, along with almost all of the upstream interactions and cosmic ray
muons. Event timing cuts also help reject cosmic ray muons.

The STAR detector combines a large acceptance with a ﬂexible trigger 21.
Charged particles are detected in the pseudorapidity range |η| < 2 and 2.4 <
|η| < 4 by a large central time projection chamber (TPC) and two forward
TPCs. This TPC can also identify particles by dE/dx. Neutral particles are
detected by a central barrel (|η| < 1) and endcap (1 < η < 2) calorimeter. Two
zero degree calorimeters will detect neutrons from nuclear breakup, useful for
background rejection.

For triggering, a scintillator barrel covering |η| < 1 and multi-wire pro-
portional chambers covering 1 < |η| < 2 measure charged particle multiplicity
on an event by event basis. These detectors have good segmentation, allowing

for total multiplicity and topological selection in the trigger. The trigger has
4 levels, with the earliest level based on ﬁeld programmable gate arrays and
the later levels computer based. The ﬁnal selection uses on-line TPC track-
ing. Peripheral collisions data will be collected in parallel with central collision
data. Simulations show that the planned trigger algorithms should be able to
eﬃciently select peripheral events while rejecting enough background enough
to minimize deadtime 8.

STAR took it’s ﬁrst data this summer (2000). The central TPC, scintillator
barrel and zero degree calorimeters were operational. Although the trigger was
not completely functional, in late August, the collaboration took about 7 hours
of data with a dedicated trigger optimized to select 2-track peripheral events 22.
The trigger rate of 20-40 Hz was ﬁltered to 1-2 Hz by the ﬁnal trigger, which
reconstructed the tracks on-line. About 20,000 events were written to tape.

The initial event selection required a 2-oppositely-charged track, primary
vertex in the interaction diamond. The tracks were required to be at least
slightly acoplanar to eliminate cosmic ray muons, and the event had to have
a small p⊥. About 300 events passed these cuts. This data is now being
analyzed for signals from e+e− pair and ρ0 production - the two processes

with the largest cross sections. Figure 7 shows an example of a ρ0 candidate.
The CMS collaboration plans to study peripheral collisions with lead and

calcium beams at LHC23. Their plans are at a fairly early stage.

6 Conclusions

Peripheral collisions of heavy nuclei can probe a wide variety of phenomena,
including many faces of strong QED. Production of e+e− and qq pairs can
probe the electrodynamics of the vacuum. Besides the physics interest, pe-
ripheral collisions aﬀect many other areas, as a tool for hadron spectroscopy,
and impacting accelerator design,

After many years of theoretical discussion, experimental results are begin-

ning to become available.

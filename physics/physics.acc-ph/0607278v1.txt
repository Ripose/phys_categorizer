Ionization Cooling in all Phase Space Planes with Various Absorber
Shapes, Including Parallel-Faced Absorbers

Abstract

Ionization cooling in a straight beamline reduces the transverse emittance of a beam, and has little eﬀect on the
longitudinal emittance (generally, in fact, it increases the longitudinal emittance). Once the beamline bends, the
introduction of dispersion creates a coupling between the transverse and longitudinal planes. If this coupling is
handled properly, one can achieve cooling in all three phase space planes. This is usually done by placing a wedge-
shaped absorber in a region where there is dispersion. I will demonstrate using an eigenvalue analysis that there are
other conﬁgurations of dispersion and absorber shape that will achieve ionization cooling in all phase space planes.
In particular, I will show that a one can even achieve cooling in all phase planes with a parallel-faced absorber
in a dispersion-free region. I will use perturbation theory to approximate the change in the cooling rates due to
longitudinal-transverse coupling. I will then describe how the cooling of longitudinal oscillations can be understood
via the projection of the “longitudinal” eigenmodes into the transverse plane.

1. Introduction

Ionization cooling is a method for the rapid re-
duction of the emittance of a beam by passing the
beam through material (hereafter called an “ab-
sorber”) [1,2,3,4]. Its primary application has been
to muon beams for a neutrino factory or muon col-
lider, but it has been contemplated for other appli-
cations as well [5,6,7].

In a straight beamline, ionization cooling reduces
only the transverse emittance of a beam, generally
having little eﬀect on the longitudinal emittance
(in fact, generally making it somewhat worse). It

reduces the transverse emittance because the to-
tal momentum, including the transverse, is reduced
when when the beam passes through material, but
when the momentum is restored by an RF cavity, the
transverse momentum is left unchanged, and thus
reduced from its value before the absorber. It is de-
sirable, especially for a muon collider, to reduce the
longitudinal emittance as well.

There is a well-known method for accomplish-
ing this, often referred to as “emittance ex-
change” [4,8,9]. This is generally accomplished by
using a wedge-shaped absorber in a region with
non-zero dispersion, as shown in Fig. 1. Particles
with higher energy will pass through more material
than particles with lower energy as a result of the
dispersion. Thus, the energy spread in the beam
will be reduced. There is a cost to this, however.
Imagine that all the energy spread were removed by

only to present a wider range of ideas on how cool-
ing can be accomplished in all phase space planes,
not to present a full generalized theory of ionization
cooling or a working cooling lattice design.

2. Lattice

The cooling lattice will consist of a sequence of

identical cells with four sections:

(i) An absorber, which reduces the energy of the

particles

(ii) An RF cavity, which restores the energy lost
in the absorber and provides longitudinal fo-
cusing

(iii) A group of magnets transporting the beam
from the absorber to the next RF cavity
(iv) A group of magnets transporting the beam

from the cavity to the next absorber

The details of what is in the “group of magnets” will
not be important for this discussion.

There is a planar reference curve which deﬁnes
the coordinate system that we are using. The ver-
tical coordinate y is perpendicular to the plane in
which the curve lies. The horizontal coordinate x is
perpendicular to the vertical and to the tangent to
the curve, and stays on the same side of the curve.
The arc length along the curve, s, is the indepen-
dent variable for the equations of motion. For the
examples in this paper, the vertical magnetic ﬁeld
at the reference curve B0(s) will be such that a par-
ticle with a reference energy Er(s) which starts out
on the curve and moving tangent to the curve con-
tinues to do so. This particle will be referred to as
the reference particle. Note that the reference en-
ergy depends on the position in the lattice, due to
the absorber and the RF cavity.

→ −

The magnetic ﬁeld will be midplane symmetric,
meaning that the vertical ﬁeld is symmetric under
y, and the other magnetic ﬁelds are antisym-
y
metric under y
y. There are two consequences
of this. The ﬁrst is that this is not a solenoid focused
lattice, which is typical for an ionization cooling lat-
tice, but a quadrupole-focused lattice. The second is
that the vertical motion is, to lowest order, decou-
pled from the horizontal and longitudinal motions.
This second reason is the fundamental purpose in
choosing a midplane symmetric lattice. The quali-
tative results found here will continue to hold for a
solenoid-focused lattice.

means that particles with diﬀerent energies have diﬀerent
positions. The wedge-shaped absorber (right) then reduces
the energies of higher energy particles more than it reduces
the energies of lower energy particles.

this. Then there would be no way of removing the
spread in transverse position that was introduced
by the dispersion. Thus, reduction in longitudinal
emittance comes at a cost: the horizontal emittance
is increased. If done properly, the cooling accom-
plished transversely by an absorber can be shared
between the longitudinal and transverse planes, giv-
ing emittance reduction in all phase space planes.

This paper will demonstrate that achieving cool-
ing in the longitudinal plane can be accomplished by
a more general class of methods than just having dis-
persion in transverse position at a wedge-shaped ab-
sorber. It will demonstrate that cooling in all planes
happens when there is an appropriate coupling be-
tween the longitudinal and transverse planes. The
paper will explore multiple ways of generating that
coupling and compare their eﬀectiveness.

I will ﬁrst describe a simpliﬁed lattice that will
be used in this paper. I will then ascertain whether
the lattice is cooling in all phase space planes by
examining the eigenvalues for the linear matrix rep-
resenting that lattice. I will compute the eigenval-
ues approximately using perturbation theory, where
the small parameter in the expansion is the degree
of coupling between the longitudinal and transverse
planes. I will study coupling that is generated by dis-
persion and an appropriately shaped absorber, and
coupling generated by dispersion in the RF cavity.
I will then look at the eigenvalues for cases when
the perturbation expansion might not be accurate.
Finally, I will develop a more physically intuitive
understanding of how transverse cooling can reduce
the longitudinal emittance by examining the motion
in the coupled system using the eigenvectors of the
matrix that represents the lattice, which will give a
picture of the coupled motion when it is projected
into the longitudinal and transverse planes.

This paper does not address other issues of cool-
ing lattice design, in particular the ﬁnal equilibrium
emittance which results because of multiple scat-

2.1. Matrices for Lattice Sections

I want to determine whether for small deviations
from the particle with coordinates zero, the ampli-
tude of oscillations is growing or reducing. Thus, this
paper will only keep results to ﬁrst order in these
deviations, and will use matrices to represent how
these deviations change while propagating through
the lattice. The lattice is a sequence of identical cells,
and the eigenvalues for the matrix for an entire cell
will determine the characteristics of the motion.

I will denote the absorber location by a subscript
“a,” and the cavity location by a subscript “c.” The
matrix describing the motion through the magnets

where V is the maximum energy gain in the cavity,
the RF phase is φ, where φ = 0 is the phase for zero
energy gain, and ω is 2π times the RF frequency.

The absorber reduces the energy of the particles,
maintaining their direction. The horizontal position
will thus be the same as it would be if the absorber
were a drift. The time to traverse the absorber is
well approximated by assuming that the momentum
is p+ to the center of the absorber, then p− there-
after. Thus, it is a good approximation to treat the
absorber as a thin element, with surrounding drifts
absorbed into

ac and

ca.

Since the particle direction is maintained, the
transverse momentum will be reduced in the ab-
sorber by the same factor that the total momentum
is reduced, κx = p−/p+. Particles whose energy dif-
fers from the reference energy will receive a slightly
diﬀerent energy loss than the reference particle,
since the energy loss per unit length in the absorber,
dE/dx, depends on energy. To linear order, the en-

3. Eigenvalue Analysis

The transfer matrix for the full lattice,including

the absorbers and the RF cavities, is

I will be analyzing the eigenvalues of this matrix to
determine if I am achieving cooling in both planes.
First of all, it is clear that the product of the eigen-
values is κxκz, and that the eigenvalues will come in
complex conjugate pairs.

Begin with a basic lattice, with no dispersion, and
with the absorber face angle θ1 = θ2 = 0. The char-
acteristic polynomial for the matrix for the cell is

λ(1 + κx) cos(µ+ + µ−) + κx).

(12)

The roots of the characteristic polynomial are the
eigenvalues.

From this polynomial, we can see that the eigen-

values will be of the form

√κxe±iµx

√κze±iµz .

It turns out that the eigenvalues remain the same
if dx
a are nonzero, as long as one minor cor-
ac, dx
a should be replaced
rection is applied: in
with dx
a should be replaced with
dx
a /√κx.
Thus, √κx is the magnitude of the transverse
eigenvalue, and √κz is the magnitude of the longitu-
dinal eigenvalue. Clearly κx < 1; unfortunately, in
most cases of interest for cooling, κz > 1. However,
the product κxκz < 1. κz > 1 because for low en-
ergies, (d/dE)(dE/dx) < 0. While (d/dE)(dE/dx)
becomes positive for higher energies, the relative en-
ergy loss for a given absorber is less at higher ener-
gies, making κx closer to 1, and the product κxκz
closer to 1.

Since the product κxκz < 1, if one could gener-
ate coupling between the horizontal and vertical mo-
tion, it would be possible to reduce the magnitude
of the “longitudinal” eigenvalues (they begin to lose
their identity with coupling), at the cost of raising
the magnitude of the “transverse” eigenvalues. One
could do so in a way that made the magnitudes of
both sets of eigenvalues less than 1, and thus gave
cooling in all phase space planes.

If the characteristic polynomial for a matrix is
Eq. (12) plus some additional polynomial f (λ), then
one can compute the change in the eigenvalues to
lowest order. The lowest-order change in the magni-
tude of λx = √κxeiµx is

(15)

Since a change in the magnitude of λz leads to a
corresponding change in the magnitude of λx, one
only need examine the change in one eigenvalue.

Note that when λx is close to λz or λ∗

z, there will be
a large change in the eigenvalues. This corresponds
to a linear coupling resonance between the longitu-
dinal and horizontal. For our perturbation analysis,
we will assume that we are suﬃciently far from that
resonance condition, but this will be of interest later
in the paper nonetheless.

Since f is the diﬀerence between the characteris-
tic polynomial for the full system and Eq. (12), we
know something more about its properties. First of
all, it is a third order polynomial, since all character-
istic polynomials of a 4
4 matrix are fourth order
×
polynomials with leading order term λ4. Secondly,
the constant term in the characteristic polynomial is
the determinant, and the determinant of the matrix
is κxκz in all cases. Thus, f will have no constant
term. We can thus write f (λ) as f3λ3 + f2λ2 + f1λ.
I will examine the change in the magnitude of λz.

Using the polynomial expression for f (λ), it is

There are two methods for generating coupling
between the phase space planes. The most common
method is to create an absorber with nonzero values
for the angles θ1 and θ2 (in most cases with θ1 = θ2,
thus referred to as a “wedge”). Another method is
to generate the coupling by having dispersion in the
RF cavity, which does not require any change in the
shape of the absorber.

Since κx ≈

1 in most cases, the quantity
κx can be treated as small. Thus, the second
κz −
and third terms in Eq. (18) can be neglected, as
long as one is far from the linear synchro-betatron
resonance. Equation (18) indicates that if one has
a dispersion in position but not momentum at the
absorber, the absorber should have θ1 = θ2 (i.e.,
a wedge shape), and θ1 positive if the dispersion
is positive. This is the usual method of “emittance
exchange.”

If, on the other hand, there is no dispersion in po-
sition but there is dispersion in horizontal momen-
tum, one should instead use a rotated slab (i.e., θ1 =
θ2). Particles with larger momentum will have an
−
angle in one direction; if the absorber is rotated so
there is more material along that direction, there
will be a greater energy loss for those particles.

One might ask whether it is easier to construct
a lattice that makes the ﬁrst term large than it is
to construct a lattice that makes the fourth term
large. In fact, either term can be made large, and
which one is used depends on the desired properties

of the lattice. Take, for instance, the RFOFO cool-
ing ring described in [11]. (dE/dx)dx
a for that lat-
tice is about 0.027. If one ﬁnds the largest value of
the momentum dispersion, then (dE/dx)Ldp
a/(2p+)
is around 0.002. While it may seem that the for-
mer is signiﬁcantly larger than the latter, the fact
is that the lattice was designed with a ring shape,
which tends to generate position dispersion rather
than momentum dispersion. One can construct lat-
tices where (dE/dx)Ldp
a/(2p+) is larger, especially
when the beta function at the absorber is small, by
having one half of the lattice cell bending in one di-
rection and and the other half bending in the reverse
direction.

3.2. Dispersion in the RF Cavity

If instead, θ0 = θ1 = 0, but we have dispersion at
the cavity, there is still coupling between the longi-
tudinal and transverse planes, in this case generated
by the dispersion at the RF cavity. The additional
terms in the characteristic polynomial are

to an absorber with substantial rotations in its faces,
the strength of the coupling generated by dispersion
in the RF cavities is relatively weak. The RFOFO
ring was not necessarily designed for maximizing
coupling in this way, but it is unlikely to be possible
to increase the dispersion suﬃciently while keeping
a reasonably small beta function in the lattice. One
may be able to increase the RF voltage somewhat,
but certainly not enough to change the overall re-
sult.

3.3. Running Closer to Resonance

The perturbation theory analysis assumed that
one was far from the point where any two of the
eigenvalues of the matrix are close to each other. If
they do become close, then the estimates above are
not valid, and the eigenvalues should be computed
directly.

≈

Begin with the case where there is dispersion in
the RF cavity and θ0 = θ1 = 0. Figure 3 shows the
magnitude of the eigenvalues as a function of µ+ +
µ−, where I am taking µ+ = µ−. Note that when
(µ+ + µ−)/(2π)
0.08, which is the synchrotron
tune, then the magnitudes of all the eigenvalues be-
come less than 1 [12]. What one is seeing here is
the manifestation of a coupling resonance in a non-
conservative dynamical system. Note that the same
resonance phenomenon at (µ++µ−)/(2π)
0.08
results in the longitudinal eigenvalue becoming more
unstable: instead of the resonance pulling the eigen-
values together, it pushes them further apart. The
signs of these eﬀects are consistent with what one ex-
pects from the perturbation calculation in Eq. (20):
the sign of sin(µ+ + µ−) gives the dominant eﬀect
for determining whether the magnitude of the longi-
tudinal eigenvalue increases or increases. The loops
in Fig. 3 near the tunes of 0 and 0.5 are not impor-
tant for this discussion: they are simply the linear
resonances of the transverse lattice.

tween the planes is in fact an advantage in this case,
since one is trying to make the transverse damping
aﬀect the longitudinal plane.

Having a low horizontal tune is generally imprac-
tical for cooling channels, since that tends to give a
larger beta function at the absorber, which results
in a larger equilibrium emittance due to multiple
scattering [3,4]. However, one could instead run in
the passband with horizontal tunes from 1 to 1.5,
which would both create a low beta function and
ensure that coupling pulled the magnitudes of the
eigenvalues closer to each other. It would also allow
for a longer cell, making it possible to increase the
synchrotron tune, putting it further from the inte-
ger resonance. It may be more diﬃcult to have a
large momentum acceptance in such a lattice, how-
ever, since the passband from tunes of 1 to 1.5 gen-
erally would have a smaller relative momentum ac-
ceptance than the lower passbands.

This example is meant more as a proof of prin-
ciple, demonstrating that one can in principle use
any method of
longitudinal-transverse coupling
to achieve cooling in all degrees of freedom. The
method may, however, have practical applications
in cases where it is impractical to control the shape
of the absorber. One example might be the use of a
lithium lens in the ﬁnal stages of cooling for a muon
collider. The method may be more interesting at
later stages of a muon collider in any case, since the
limited width of the resonance will likely translate
into a limited momentum acceptance for such a
method, requiring a beam which has already had
its longitudinal emittance reduced signiﬁcantly.

It is interesting to compare Fig. 3 with what one
would obtain when using a wedge-shaped absorber

7

with dispersion. This is shown in Fig. 4. Note that
the eigenvalue magnitudes are closer to each other
over the entire range of horizontal tunes (their val-
ues without dispersion at the wedges can be de-
duced from Fig. 3). At both the sum and diﬀer-
ence resonances, the magnitudes are pushed fur-
ther apart. The diﬀerence in the behavior near the
synchro-betatron resonances between this case and
that shown in Fig. 3 is a result of the non-symplectic
nature of the coupling that is generated by the wedge
with dispersion. Eqs. (16) and (18) do an extremely
good job of predicting the behavior in Fig. 4, in-
cluding the resonant behavior; this is to be expected
since the eigenvalues never get too close together,
even near the resonance.

4. Physical Explanation

To get some understanding of what is going on
physically, one should examine the eigenvectors. The
real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors deﬁne
an ellipse that the particles move on. Of course, in
the case of cooling, the radius of the particles are
decreasing (or sometimes increasing), but that piece
can be taken out (i.e., the diﬀerence of the magni-
tude of the eigenvalue from 1). To see the ellipse,
take the real (or imaginary) part of the eigenvec-
tor, multiply the vector by the matrix for the lattice
cell, and divide the result by the magnitude of the
corresponding eigenvalue. Repeat the process, and
one will trace out an ellipse in phase space. Alterna-
tively, if v is the eigenvector, then the ellipse is the
set of points obtained from

Re

by varying u from 0 to 2π.

In the case where there is no coupling, the eigen-
vectors have components either entirely in the hor-
izontal plane, or entirely in the longitudinal (time-
energy) plane. However, once one introduces any
type of longitudinal-transverse coupling, all of the
eigenvectors will have components in both planes.
This is the key to what allows the reduction in trans-
verse momentum spread that the absorber accom-
plishes to reduce the amplitude of what would oth-
erwise be longitudinal motion. The only eﬀect that
actually reduces the beam emittance is the reduc-
tion of transverse momentum in the absorber.

Figure 5 shows the projection of the longitudi-
nal eigenvector (identiﬁed by the phase of its corre-
sponding eigenvalue) at the absorber into the trans-
verse plane. The ﬁgure shows two cases: one where

Fig. 5. Projection of the longitudinal eigenvector at the ab-
sorber into the transverse plane when there is dispersion at
the absorber. The solid ellipse (which has no area, so it ap-
pears as a line) is for a parallel-faced absorber (θ1 = θ2 = 0),
whereas the dashed ellipse is for a wedge-shaped absorber.

there is dispersion at the absorber, but the absorber
has parallel faces with θ1 = θ2 = 0, and one where
the absorber is wedge shaped, with θ1 = θ2 > 0.
For the parallel-faced case, there is no reduction in
the magnitude of the longitudinal eigenvalue, de-
spite the fact that Fig. 5 shows that there is a non-
zero projection of the longitudinal eigenvalue onto
the horizontal plane (and horizontal momentum in
particular). The reason that there is no reduction
in the magnitude of the longitudinal eigenvalue is
that the ellipse projected into the horizontal plane
has no area. The absorber makes positive momenta
more negative and negative momenta more positive,
reducing the area of an ellipse. But if the ellipse has
no area, no reduction can occur. Thus, one needs
the projected ellipse to have a nonzero area to see
an eﬀect. This is what making the absorber wedge-
shaped accomplishes, as can be seen in Fig. 5.

If one changes the horizontal tune to around 0.077,
one can see from Fig. 4 that the longitudinal and
transverse eigenvalues return almost to their values
without coupling. This is reﬂected in the eigenvec-
tors in that the area of the horizontal projection of
the ellipse relative to the area of the longitudinal
projection is less than it was for horizontal tunes
away from the longitudinal tune (which was shown
in Fig. 5).

Figure 6 shows the ellipses for the case where
there is dispersion at the RF cavity and not the
absorber (this corresponds to Fig. 3). The ellipses
are smaller when one is away from resonance, and
larger when one is closer to resonance, reﬂecting the
stronger coupling between the eigenvalues near the

sorber into the transverse plane when there is a parallel-faced
absorber and dispersion only at the RF cavity. The solid el-
lipse is for a horizontal tune of 0.75, the dotted ellipse for a

the dashed ellipse for a horizontal tune of 0.91 (near the
other coupling resonance).

resonance, in particular that the magnitude of the
longitudinal eigenvalue is reduced (or increased for
the higher-tune resonance) there. What the ﬁgure
does not illustrate is why near the low tune reso-
nance (0.09 for the example in Fig. 6), the magnitude
of the longitudinal eigenvalue is reduced, whereas
near the high tune resonance, the magnitude of the
longitudinal eigenvalue is increased.

To understand this, one must ﬁrst think about
what area means for an ellipse in four-dimensional
phase space. Hamilton’s equations of motion can be
written as

This gives the expected answer when the ellipse lies
entirely in either the horizontal or longitudinal phase
space plane, and is thus the obvious extension of
the concept. In fact, it is really the sum of the pro-
jected areas in the two planes. Furthermore, it is in-

8

variant under symplectic transformations of v, and
thus reﬂects the area-preserving nature of symplec-
tic transformations.

Note that this area, as deﬁned, has a sign. Since
the eigenvectors come in complex-conjugate pairs,
there are always two areas with the same magnitude
and opposite signs generated by the eigenvectors of
a matrix, assuming the eigenvectors were not nor-
malized diﬀerently. Furthermore, since the area is
really a sum of the horizontal area and the longitu-
dinal area, these projected areas individually have
signs as well. It turns out that when the longitudi-
nal eigenvalue gets closer in magnitude to the trans-
verse one, the areas have the same sign, whereas
when they are pushed away from each other, the ar-
eas have opposite signs.

Physically, this is because the sign of the ellipse
area is related to the direction which a particle moves
around the ellipse in phase space, as can be seen from
Eq. (22). There is a “physical” direction that parti-
cles move around an ellipse, which is reﬂected in the
signs of the nonzero elements in J. Normally, par-
ticles with positive horizontal momentum will have
an increasing horizontal position; particles with a
larger energy will have a shorter time of ﬂight (ig-
noring momentum compaction). When the signs of
the projected areas (horizontal and longitudinal) are
identical, the particles are moving in the “physical”
direction on both the horizontal and longitudinal
ellipses. If, on the other hand, the projected areas
have opposite signs, then longitudinal motion in the
“physical” direction will appear to have “unphysi-
cal” motion in the horizontal plane. Thus, in par-
ticular, the reduction in horizontal momentum that
the absorber accomplishes will not be translated
physically into the area reduction that one hopes
for, since the change in horizontal position goes the
wrong way. The result is the eigenvalue magnitudes
getting further apart, as seen on the right hand side
of Fig. 3.

5. Conclusion

I have shown that one can obtain ionization cool-
ing in all phase space planes through two diﬀer-
ent methods: by generating dispersion at the ab-
sorber and shaping the absorber appropriately (this
is the usual method), and by using the longitudinal-
transverse coupling resonance with a parallel-faced
absorber. I have approximated the eﬀect by pertur-
bation theory, and using that have demonstrated

9

that one should shape the absorber in conformity to
the dispersion at the absorber, in particular taking
into account whether the dispersion is in position or
transverse momentum. I have demonstrated that it
is the fact that the longitudinal motion has a com-
ponent in the transverse plane that allows the ab-
sorber to cause cooling in the longitudinal plane as
well as the transverse. The strength of the eﬀect is
related to the area, including sign, of the “longitu-
dinal” ellipse projected into the horizontal plane.

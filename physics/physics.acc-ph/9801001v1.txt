q-DEFORMING THE SYNCHROTRON SHAPE FUNCTION

We replace the usual integral in the shape function of the synchrotron spectrum by a
Jackson (q-deformed) integral and write down the formulas required to calculate the
Jackson ﬁrst deformed form of the synchrotron shape function.

Synchrotron radiation1, ﬁrst observed in 1947, is an extremely important phe-
nomena in the realm of physics. It is a nonthermal (magnetobremsstrahlung) radi-
ation pattern, which can be encountered in many cyclic accelerators and in much
wider astrophysical contexts 2. On the other hand, the interesting elaborations on
the quantum deformed (basic) calculus are well-established in the mathematical
literature 3, and over the past years there have been much interest to apply the
q-deformed techniques to physical phenomena and theories. The purpose of this
work is to present the q-deformation of the synchrotron shape function.

The spectral intensity of the magnetobremsstrahlung in the synchrotron regime

is proportional to the so-called shape function 1

Wω ∝

(cid:16)
where ωm is given in terms of the cyclotron radian frequency ωc as ωm = ωc γ3, and
F is given by F (ξ) = 9√3
ξ K5/3(z)dz, where K is the MacDonald function of the
8π ξ

quoted fractional order. The small and large asymptotic limits of the synchrotron

shape function are as follows

At the beginning of the century, F.H. Jackson 4 introduced the so called q-

integrals, which are currently known as Jackson’s integrals. By deﬁnition

On the other hand, Thomae and Jackson deﬁned a q-integral on (0,

In the case of the synchrotron radiation we have to take f as the q-deformed K
function. To get this function we can use any of the three basic Bessel J functions
one can encounter in the mathematical literature, which are expressed in terms of
the basic hypergeometric functions 2φ1 (for the ﬁrst Jackson Bessel function J),
0φ1 (for the second Jackson Bessel function J), and 1φ1 (for the Hahn-Exton Bessel
function J), respectively.

Here, we shall use the ﬁrst Jackson form of the q-deformed J, because it does
not imply the deformation of the argument as the other two basic analogs do (see,
e.g., 5), i.e.,

be applied to all three types of q-deformations.

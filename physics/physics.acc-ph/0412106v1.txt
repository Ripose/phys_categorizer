Surfaces: Eﬀect on the Secondary Electron Yield

Abstract

The eﬀect of electron conditioning on commercially aluminium alloys 1100 and
6063 were investigated. Contrary to the assumption that electron conditioning, if
performed long enough, can reduce and stabilize the SEY to low values (≤ 1.3, value
of many pure elements [1]), the SEY of aluminium did not go lower than 1.8. In
fact, it reincreases with continued electron exposure dose.

1 Introduction

In the framework of the ILC electron cloud suppression, studies on secondary electron

emission (SEE) from technical surfaces are ongoing.

In this brief paper we will present secondary electron yield (SEY), δ, results obtained

from two technical surfaces : aluminium alloys 1100 and 6063. We compare these results

to other data obtained elsewhere.

It is known, from the literature, that a metallic aluminium surface has a δmax below

1 [1]. However, its technical surface is oxidized, and the δmax can be well above 2.5. This

value might not be compatible with the running of a charged positively particle beam,

and it becomes necessary to ﬁnd a way to lower the yield of such surfaces. Coatings and

electron or ion conditioning are two ways of achieving this goal [2] [3].

2 Experiment Description and Methodology

The system, sketch in Fig.1, and experimental methodology used to measure the sec-

ondary electron yield have been described thoroughly in [2]. Hence, we will summarize

the description of the SEY system.

1. Analysis chamber

9. Electrostatic energy analyzer

2. Loadlock chamber

10. X-ray source

3. Sample plate entry

11. SEY/SEM electron gun

4. Sample transfer plate

12. Microfocus ion gun

5. Rack and pinion travel

13. Sputter ion gun

6. Sample plate stage

14. To pressure gauges and RGA

7. XYZ θ OmniaxT M manipulator

15. To vacuum pumps

8. Sample on XYZ θ

16. Gate valve

The system is composed of two coupled stainless steel ultra high vacuum (UHV)

chambers where the pressure is in the low 10−10 Torr scale in the measurement chamber

and high 10−9 Torr scale in the ”load lock” chamber. Samples, individually screwed to a

carrier plate, are loaded ﬁrst onto an aluminium transfer plate in the load lock chamber,

evacuated to the low 10−8 Torr scale, and then transferred into the measurement chamber.

The sample to be measured is installed on a special manipulator arm. The feature of

this arm allow us to bake the loaded sample, and the temperature is recorded by the use

of type C thermocouples. The back of the samples are heated by electron bombardment.

This is achieved by biasing a tungsten ﬁlament negatively.

The electronic circuit for SEY measurement is that presented in Fig.2 [4]. The energy

of the computer-controlled electron beam coming from the gun is decoupled from the

target measurement circuitry. However, the ground is common to both. The target is

attached to a bias voltage supply and an electrometer connected in series to the data

gathering computer Analog Digital Converter (ADC). Measurements were made with a

Keithley 6487, a high resolution picoameter with internal variable ±505 V supply and

IEEE-488 interface. The 6487 has several ﬁlter modes which were turned oﬀ for our

2

measurements. The integration time for each current reading is 167 µs, which is the

minimum value for the instrument. The current was sampled one hundred times; the

mean and standard deviation were returned from the picoameter to the computer.

The SEY (δ) deﬁnition is determined from equation 1. In practice equation 2 is used

because it contains parameters measured directly in the experiment.

ing on the surface of the sample) and IT is the total current measured on the sample

(IT = IP + IS). IS is the secondary electron current leaving the target. The repro-

ducibility of the experiment is around 2%.

3 Eﬀect of 130 eV Electron Bombardment on the

SEY of Al

3.1 History of Aluminium 1100 and 6063 samples

Aluminium 1100 is composed, at the minimum, of 99% Al. Copper is present in the range

of 0.2% to 0.5%. The other elements, present as impurities, are manganese, zinc, silicon

and iron. Aluminium 6063 is composed of 98.9% Al, 0.45% to 0.9% of Mg, and 0.2% to

0.6% of Si. Other impurities for Al 1100 are also present in 6063, including copper.

The samples were chemically cleaned for UHV use, but not deliberately passivated,

and then kept in a dry nitrogen purged box.

In an attempt to create an aluminium-nitride (AlN) thin ﬁlm, for the purpose of

lowering the SEY, the Al 1100 sample was heated to 200◦C with pure hot 200◦C nitrogen

gas blown on it. The results were not encouraging (too low temperature), so the sample

surface was scraped clean in air with a tungsten carbide tool, and was loaded in the SEY

system. XPS conﬁrmed that the sample was quite clean, but air oxidized.

Two Al 6063 samples were also tested. The ﬁrst sample will be referred to as Al 6063.

3

This sample was also scraped clean before loading into the SEY system. The second

sample, which is not scraped, will be referred as the LER Al 6063 sample. This sample

comes from a piece of the extruded Low Energy Ring (LER) chamber made of Al 6063.

This piece was UHV cleaned and stored in air for years and then loaded as it in the SEY

system. The LER accelerator provides the positron beam in the SLAC B-factory.

3.2 Secondary Electron Yield of Al 1100

The SEY results obtained by exposing the Al 1100 sample to an electron conditioning

beam of 130 eV kinetic energy are presented in Fig.3 and 4. In the NLC positron damping

ring the average energy of the electrons from the cloud was computed to be 130 eV [3].

The SEY values were measured for a primary beam impinging the Al surface at 23◦ from

normal incidence. During the conditioning, the pressure rose to 2.10−9 Torr equivalent N2,

due to electron stimulated desorption (ESD) from the sample. As the dosing continued

the pressure diminished to 5.10−10 Torr. The eﬀect of electron conditioning of ESD on Al

was, and still is, widely documented [5].

During the ﬁrst 1000 µC/mm2, the SEY of the Al 1100 sample goes down as expected.

However, we can see that this trend seems to level oﬀ, suggesting that the conditioning of

aluminium is a very long process, Fig.4. However, the next point at 3520 µC/mm2 shows

an increase of the SEY, hence an increase of the δmax.

This increase is contrary to expectation, i.e, normally yield decreases with dose. In

order to check the consistency of the value, the sample was moved 5 mm, and a second

point was collected, Fig.5. The results agreed and we continued the conditioning to still

higher dose.

To check the measurement system reproducibility, a previously conditioned and mea-

sured NEG sample was installed on the holder and re-measured. A NEG sample can be

used as an SEY reference sample, especially when baked. The SEY curve and the δmax

obtained from the NEG were those expected, hence ruling out any instrumental problem.

The last value for the δmax, reached after 40 mC/mm2 of electron exposure was 2.1.

Thus, the conclusion that we had reached saturation, at the previous point, was hasty.

4

3.3 Secondary Electron Yield of Al 6063

The SEY results obtained by exposing the Al 6063 sample to an electron conditioning

beam of 130 eV kinetic energy are presented in Fig.4, 6 and Fig.7.

As observed for the Al 1100 sample, the SEY of the Al 6063 also decreases with

the increasing dose until reaching a dose of ∼ 800 µC/mm2, Fig.4 and Fig.6, left plot.

After this point the SEY increases, but not smoothly, Fig.4. The SEY max at a dose

of 2010 µC/mm2 reached a value of 2.13. Subsequent measurements at this dose are

in very good agreement with the ﬁrst set of data Fig.7, left plot. The next points at

3000 µC/mm2, 7000 µC/mm2 and 12000 µC/mm2 have been also measured twice, Fig.7

right plot as an example, and were found to agree within 1.5%. The SEY at those

subsequent doses are less than the one obtained at 2000 µC/mm2, Fig.4 and 6, right plot.

This jump is currently not understood.

3.4 Secondary Electron Yield of the LER Al 6063

The SEY results obtained by exposing the LER Al 6063 sample to an electron conditioning

beam of 130 eV kinetic energy are presented in Fig.8, 9 and Fig.10.

As observed for the Al 1100 and the Al 6063 scraped samples, the SEY of the LER

sample decreases with the increasing dose until reaching a dose of ∼ 800 µC/mm2, Fig.4

and Fig.9, left plot. After this point the SEY increases, but not smoothly, Fig.4 and Fig.10.

On the second part of the dosing,Fig.10, the evolution of the SEY changes drastically from

the as-installed shapes and values Fig.8. The δmax shifts from being reached at 160 eV

to being reached at 270 eV. The curves after reaching a dose of 708 µC/mm2 becomes

similar as the SEY plots from clean scraped Al 1100 and 6063.

3.5 Are the results believable ?

Despite the fact that our results seems contradictory to common belief, previous data col-

lected at CERN (Conseil Europ´een pour la Recherche Nucl´eaire) [6] supports, indirectly,

our ﬁndings. The conditioning curves, Fig.11, of the 300◦C pre-baked aluminium sample

5

(blue circle) show a dip, which bottoms around 1.8, data taken at normal incidence. The

SEY of the last aluminium point, around 7 mC/mm2, is in very good agreement with our

value obtained at 8 mC/mm2, Fig.4.

In some other data, collected at ANL (Argonne National Laboratory) on an Al 6063

sample, the δmax achieved after an electron dose exposure of 350 nA/cm2 for 5h (equivalent

to 63 µC/mm2) at an energy of 100 eV is around 2.1 [7]. From these comparisons and

the system check, by the use of a NEG, we are conﬁdent in the results obtained above

8 mC/mm2.

4 XPS study of the C1s and Al2p peak

4.1 XPS study of Al 1100

XPS analysis was carried out to observe the evolution of the carbon and aluminium

chemistry during the electron conditioning, Fig.12. The spectra are shifted vertically

from one another for clarity. The ”Al as installed” spectra is located at the top of Fig.12,

and the ”27880 µC/mm2” at its bottom.

From the ”as installed” condition to the end of the conditioning, a few obvious ob-

servation can be done. First of all, the ”as installed” sample is contaminated by ﬂuorine

(F). The sample was not passivated and was thoroughly scraped. We must assume that

this F is present in the air and reacts very quickly with a pure Al surface, hence getting

imbedded in the oxide layer. Fluorine compounds are used heavily in the semiconductor

industry to prepare silicon wafers. Our location is in the heart of this industry.

During the initial conditioning the F1s (685 eV) quickly disappears, Fig.13. However, a

peak of nitrogen then appears, N1s (398 eV), Fig.14.

It is possible that during our attempt to create an AlN ﬁlm, a proportion of N was ab-

sorbed in the bulk of the Al 1100. During conditioning, the surface is ”cleaned-up”,

by ESD and the mobility of the N is enhanced, thence diﬀusing to the surface or near

subsurface(1-5 nm depth). This N concentration, being very small, 2 at%, is unlikely to

have inﬂuenced the behaviour of the aluminium with respect to the SEY.

6

A survey of the Al2p was carried out during the conditioning. The high-energy reso-

lution spectra are shown in Fig.15. A pure Al surface will present a single peak at 73 eV,

and a pure Al2O3 surface will have one peak at 74.5 eV [8].

The ”as installed” Al2p is peaked at 73.5 eV and 76.5 eV, shown at a resolution of

0.5 eV for a step scan energy of 1 eV. Those peaks match the Al2p location of a pure

Al surface and a halogenated Al surface. As the ﬂuorine disappears from the surface,

the spectrum shifts to lower binding energy and presents the characteristic of a thin alu-

minium oxide ﬁlm (less than 5 nm) on an aluminium substrate. Very similar curves on

an Al 6063 alloy sample can be found in [7], where the peaks are representatives of the

pure Al (73 eV BE) and the oxidized Al (76 eV BE). Moreover, during conditioning of

our Al 1100 sample, the relative intensities of the peaks changes during the conditioning.

The aluminium peak (73 eV) becomes smaller than the oxide peak (75 eV).

From this last observation we hypothesize that we are thickening the aluminium oxide

layer by decomposing carbon monoxide and dioxide from the residual gas and, by rear-

ranging the bonds on the surface, the oxygen displaces the carbon covering the aluminium.

This interpretation for the Al is supported by the C1s spectra, Fig.16. The C of the

”as installed” Al is peaked at 287.5 eV, but also has a peak at 291 eV. This high binding

energy (BE) is reminiscent of carbon passivated by HF acid which shows a peak at 289 eV

[8]. CF2 compounds also will have a peak at 292 eV [8]. After an accumulated dose of

850 µC/mm2, the F disappeared, and we saw a shift from 291 eV to 288 eV, location of

oxidized C1s. During conditioning, the peak not only gets shifted further toward 285 eV

(marker of an amorphous/graphitic C surface) but also the peak intensity rose. This

shows that the C is transformed from an oxidized state to its amorphous/graphitic form.

4.2 XPS of Al 6063

XPS analysis of Al 6063 was carried out to observe the evolution of the carbon and

aluminium chemistry during the electron conditioning, Fig.17. The spectra are shifted

vertically from one another for clarity. The ”Al as installed” spectra is located at the top

of Fig.17, and the ”12817 µC/mm2” near the BE axis.

7

The observations on Al 6063 are similar of those on Al 1100. The ”as installed” Al2p

is peaked at 73.5 eV and 76 eV, for a step scan energy of 0.25 eV, Fig.18. Those peaks

match the location of a pure Al surface and a halogenated Al surface. As the ﬂuorine

disappears from the surface, due to electron bombardment, the spectrum shifts to lower

binding energy and presents the characteristic of a thin aluminium oxide ﬁlm (less than

5 nm) on an aluminium substrate, Fig.19. The shift in energy, is also accompanied with

a change in intensities between the peaks, as it was observed on the Al 1100, Fig.15. In

[7], the XPS spectra from the technical Al 6063 sample, exposed to the eﬀect of a running

accelerator beam, shows a shift toward lower BE of the oxidized peak. The intensity of

the oxidized Al peak before running the beam is higher than the pure Al peak. It does

not seems that the relative intensities between the pure metal and oxidized metal varies

at the end of the beam exposure. The XPS spectra before and after exposure to the beam

of the facing away side of the sample shows no variation.

The presence of signiﬁcant amounts of Mg inside the 6063 alloy complicates the in-

terpretation of the XPS data. Its continuous presence on the surface is marked by its 1s

peak at 1306 eV BE, Fig.17. Mg is also a very good oxygen getter and its evolution was

monitored by observing the 301 eV and 308 eV BE KLL Auger peaks, Fig.20. A pure

Mg surface will present an higher Auger peak at 301 eV that at 308 eV, [8]; this picture

is reversed for an oxidized Mg [9]. During the conditioning we see that the 308 eV peaks

increases and the 301 eV disappears.

An XPS spectrum from a piece of LER vacuum chamber, made of Al 6063, was also

taken. The spectrum does not show any pure metal peak at 301 eV. This piece of LER

chamber was kept in air for many years, hence built a thick natural Al and Mg oxide,

probably Mg(OH)2 [9]. All of these observations support our preceding hypothesis, in

which we stated that, during electron conditioning an oxide layer grows on the technical

surface.

The Al 6063 XPS spectrum for the C1s (285 ev BE), Fig.21, is similar to the one

obtained for the Al 1100, Fig.16. The results obtained on the two alloy surfaces show the

same chemistry evolution.

8

4.3 XPS of LER Al 6063

XPS analysis of LER Al 6063 was carried out to observe the evolution of the carbon and

aluminium chemistry during the electron conditioning, Fig.22. The spectra are shifted

vertically from one another for clarity. The ”Al as installed” spectra is located at the

top of Fig.22, and the ”12817 µC/mm2” near the BE axis. The survey shows that a non

scraped Al 6063 has a diﬀerent chemistry at the surface than the scraped Al 6063 Fig.17.

There is, for example, no presence of ﬂuorine (685 eV) on the surface.

The Al2p spectra of the non scraped Al 6063 sample coming from the LER chamber

shows the presence of one peak at 78 eV. A non oxidized Al surface has an Al2p peak,

peaked at 73 eV [10]. As no ﬂuorine is present, this peak could be the mark of an oxide.

However, as seen in [8] Al2O3 is peaked at 74.5 eV, however from [10], Al2O3 is peaked at

75.6 eV and Al(OH)3 at 76.5 eV. None of the oxide explain the shift to the higher (78 eV)

BE. However, as the electron dose received by the sample increased, the peak shifts to

lower BE and broadens. This broadening is the signature of the rearrangement of the

aluminium oxide.

The LER Al 6063 XPS spectrum for the C1s (285 ev BE), Fig.24, is similar to the

one obtained for the Al 1100 and scraped Al 6063, Fig.16 and Fig.21. Their evolution

during electron bombardment are also similar, the oxidized carbon being transformed into

a more graphitic form. It was hypothesized that the C peak at 291 eV for the scraped

Al technical surfaces was due to the presence of F at the surface. As no F is present on

the LER Al 6063, the deformed shape of the C must be due to diﬀerent oxygen bonding.

Oxide containing hydroxide-type (C-O-H) produces a chemical shift of 1.5 eV from the

graphitic carbon (285 eV BE). Carbonyl (C=O) and carboxyl (COOH) have chemical

shift of 3.0 eV and 4.5 eV, respectively [11]. As this sample was kept in air for years, all

oxidation state of the surface are likely. The intensity of the ”as installed” C1s peak of

the LER 6063 sample, Fig.22, is higher than that for the scraped 6063 and 1100 samples,

Fig.17 and Fig.12, respectively. A fair amount of carbonate (CO3) can also be present,

with the BE of this compound on a native Al oxide peaked at 291 eV [10]. However, it is

stated in [12] that aluminium carbonate is not expected to be formed in presence of CO2

9

and water.

The Mg KL23L23 exhibits a shift in energy toward a lower BE in function of the dose

received, Fig.25. The intensity measured by the electron analyser of the XPS varies from

an as installed piece to the conditioning at a dose of 708 µC/mm2. From this point on

the variation in intensities are minimal. The Mg2p of this LER sample was also displaced

toward higher BE (54 eV) and shifts toward lower BE (52 eV) during electron conditioning.

Even, if MgCO3 was present on the surface (BE : 52 eV [10]) the 54 eV BE cannot be

explained by chemistry alone. In fact, when comparing the binding energies of several

peaks from the LER sample spectrum from the as installed state versus the 11251 µC/mm2

electron dosing state, Fig.22, we found that the peaks of the 11251 µC/mm2 spectrum

have shifted 2 eV to lower BE. This implies that the LER sample as installed must have

charge up during XPS measurement.

5 Explaining the dip in the SEY curve

The ”as installed” aluminium surface is contaminated by components in the air, hence a

”carbonaceous oxide” layer forms. During electron conditioning, the ESD process cleans

up and modiﬁes the chemistry of the surface. Unpolymerized hydrocarbons and water

are known to promote a high SEY [13].

During conditioning the SEY curve goes down, Fig.4, as modiﬁcation and removal of the

surface contamination takes place. The SEY curves is the sum of aluminium-oxide(high

SEY) an aluminium surface(low SEY) and graphitic carbon. At some point, the alu-

minium surface contribution prevails, as the oxide layer is not yet formed or arranged

properly. That is the dip of the curves. Past this point, the contribution of the forming

aluminium oxide starts prevailing, hence raising the SEY.

This model is also supported by others SEY measurements, with a 3 keV electron

beam energy, of an evaporated Al and grown Al2O3 thin ﬁlm [14] [15]. The SEY, at

3 keV, of an Al thin ﬁlm exposed to oxygen shows a dip, and this is independent of the

oxygen pressure in the vacuum chamber [15].

10

For comparison, no dip is seen on copper because copper oxide (Cu2O) has a lower SEY

than the pure Cu [1] [16].

Finally, it is not known how much higher doses of electron on the surface will aﬀect

the SEY. It is possible, following our hypothesis from our XPS observation, that we are

building an aluminium oxide layer, therefore the SEY will keep increasing. The δmax could

reach any values between 2 and 9, values of Al2O3 (layer) [1].

The usual mechanism for oxidation of metals involves diﬀusion of atomic oxygen through

the growing oxide layer toward the underlying metal, which is then oxidized. Thus, the

rate-limiting step for oxide growth, via the Mott-Carbrera mechanism, is diﬀusion of

oxygen through oxide.

6 Conclusion

We have reported on the eﬀects of conditioning, with electrons of 130 eV, on three technical

surfaces, aluminium 1100, aluminium 6063 and aluminium 6063 heavily oxidized. We have

observed that a technical aluminium surface does not seem to condition to saturation with

dose, as it is commonly observed for many other technical surfaces and thin ﬁlms. The

low dose part, below a mC/mm2, of our results appear normal, Fig.4. High doses cause

oxide growth and the yield rises, contrary to expected experience. XPS characterization

of the chemistry happening on the surface during conditioning supports our model.

In the framework of the electron cloud problem, the choice of the technical surface to be

used as vacuum chambers is clear. Non-coated, or otherwise untreated, use of aluminium

is a bad idea, as its conditioned SEY might not go consistently below 2. However, in an

accelerator, ions of few hundred eV can be made present. Their eﬀect on the surface,

from a conditioning standpoint, is not yet known.

The possibility of the enhanced optical cooling (EOC) of Lead ions in LHC is investigated. Non-
exponential feature of cooling and requirements to the ring lattice, optical and laser systems are
discussed. Comparison with optical stochastic cooling (OSC) is represented.

INTRODUCTION

in a kicker undulator is determined in smooth approxi-
mation by

In original OSC with usage of quadrupole wiggler as
a pickup [1], particles with small betatron amplitude do
not make an input into signal generation (radiation), so
they are not heating the beam.
In contrast, in EOC
method such selective action achieved by usage of mov-
able screens. These screens located on image plane of op-
tical system having radiating beam as source. Motion re-
alized with the help of fast electro-optical elements driven
by external voltage. As a result of this selection the ions
with extreme deviations of dynamic variables keep the
neighboring ions undisturbed in the ﬁrst approximation.
By this way the number of the particles in the bandwidth,
which deﬁnes the damping time can be reduced drasti-
cally. Some detailed schemes of EOC were suggested in
[2]–[4]. Below we consider EOC of fully stripped Lead
ions in LHC as example.

II. THE SCHEME OF COOLING

−

The EOC method uses a pickup undulator and one
or more kicker undulators installed in diﬀerent straight
sections of a storage ring. The distance determined by
a betatron phase advance (2p
1)π between the pickup
and the ﬁrst kicker undulator and 2p′π between each of
the following kicker undulators; wherep, p′ = 1, 2, 3...
Undulator Radiation Wavelets (URW), emitted by ions
in the pickup undulator, transferred by optical system
to the movable screen located on the image plane. Here
the undesirable part of radiation, corresponding to small
betatron amplitudes, is cut. Residual fraction or URW
ampliﬁed in optical ampliﬁer and pass together with the
ions through the followed kicker undulators.

III. THE RATE OF COOLING

The change of the square of the amplitude of betatron
oscillations of an ion, caused by sudden energy change δE

where xβ,k is the ion deviation from it’s closed orbit in
the kicker undulator; δxη = ηxβ−2(δE/E) is the change
of it’s closed orbit position; ηxis the dispersion function
in the storage ring; β is the normalized velocity. In the
approximation

amplitude and the position of the closed orbit will be de-
creased, if the valuesxβ,k < 0, δxη < 0. It follows that
to cool the ion beam the screen in the optical system
must open the pass for URWs emitted by extreme ions
entering the pickup undulator with higher energy and be-
tatron deviations xβ,p > 0from theirs closed orbits. After
that the screen will open images of ions with lower and
lower energies until the optical system must be switched
oﬀ. Then the cooling process can be repeated. So the
EOC is going simultaneously both in the longitudinal
and transverse degrees of freedom.

Optical lengths between pickup and kicker undulators
should be picked up so that to inject ions in the kicker
undulators at decelerating phases of their own URWs.

The total energy of the undulator radiation (UR) emit-
ted by a relativistic ion traversing an undulator with
magnetic ﬁeld B is given by

dius of the ion; e, Mi are the electron charge and ion mass
respectively; Zis the atomic number, Lu = M λu; M is the
number of undulator periods; γ is the relativistic factor.
For a plane harmonic undulator B2 = B2

is the peak of the undulator ﬁeld. For helical undulator

The damping time for the ion beam in the longitudinal

degree of freedom is

τ = σE/Ploss,

(6)

where σEis the energy spread of the ion beam.

According to (6), the damping time for EOC is propor-
tional to the energy spread of the beam which is much
less then the energy of ions included in similar expres-
sion for damping time controlled by Robinson’s damping
criterion. Moreover, because of the non-exponential de-
cay of both energy and angular spreads of the beam the
degree of cooling of ion beams for EOC is much higher
than 1/e reduction of these parameters.

Note that the higher the dispersion function and the
less the beta function at the location of the kicker undu-
lator the higher the rate of damping of betatron oscilla-
tions. In this case low energy jumps of ions lead to large
jumps of closed orbits and near the same large jumps of
betatron oscillation amplitudes.

IV. STOCHASTIC PROCESSES IN THE EOC

URW of one ion does not disturb trajectories of other
ions if an average distance between ions in the longitudi-
nal direction is more, than the URW’s length, M λUR,1,

2

and the transverse dimensions of the URW’s in kicker un-
dulators are overlapped and higher then the transverse
total (dispersion + betatron) dimensions of the being
cooled ion beam. This case is named “single ion in the
sample”. It corresponds to the beam current

·

[A].

(7)

If i > ic ampliﬁed URWs do not disturb the energy
spread and amplitudes of betatron oscillations of other’s
ions of the beam in the ﬁrst approximation and change
them in the second one because of a stochasticity of the
initial phases of ions in other’s URWs. Stochasticity lim-
its the degree of cooling.

Open ions of the beam loose their energies up to the
moment when they will be displayed inward to the dis-
tances corresponding to overlapping their URWs by the
stopped screen. After this time all ions will stay at the
threshold energy with the equilibrium energy spread and
the spread of amplitudes of betatron oscillations [3]

V. STORAGE RING LATTICE
REQUIREMENTS

The relative phase shifts of ions in their URWs radiated
in the pickup undulator and displaced to the entrance of
kick undulators depend on theirs energy and amplitude
of betatron oscillations. If we assume that the longitudi-
nal shifts of URWs ∆l < λUR/2, then the amplitudes of
betatron oscillations, transverse horizontal emittance of
the beam, in the smooth approximation, and the energy
spread of the beam must not exceed the values

where λx,bet = C/vx; C is the circumference of the ring,
γ−2 and αc are local slip and
vx, the tune; ηc = αc −
momentum compaction factors between undulators.

Strong limitations (9) to the energy spread can be over-
came if, according to the decrease of the high energy edge
of the being cooled beam, a change in time of optical
paths of URWs is produced. Special elements in storage

ring lattices (short inverted dipoles, quadrupole lenses et
al.) to decrease the slip [5-8] can be used as well. With
cooling of fraction of the beam at a time only, the length-
ening problem diminishes also as the ∆E/E now stands
for the energy spread in the part of the beam which is
under cooling at the moment.

VI. OPTICAL SYSTEM FOR EOC

of the ampliﬁed URWs plus the noise power

where εsample = ¯hω1,maxNphαampl is the energy in a sam-
ple; Ni, the number of ions in the ring. The bunch spac-
ing in LHC (45 m) is much bigger than the bunch length
(
5-10 cm). The same time structure of the OPA must
∼
be used. The energy of OPA emitted for the damping
time is proportional to the initial energy spread of the
ion beam.
It can be decreased by decreasing peak RF
voltage or by increasing the number of bunches.
The space resolution of the ion beam is [3]

The transverse selectivity of radiation (movable screen)
can be arranged with help of electro-optical elements.
These elements contain crystals, which change their re-
fraction index while external voltage applied. This tech-
nique is well known in optics [9].
In simplest case the
sequence of electro-optical deﬂector and a diaphragm fol-
lowed by optical lenses, allow controllable selection of ra-
diation generated by diﬀerent parts of the beam.

In these examples initial transverse beam dimensions
σx,0 < Ax,lim. It means that there is no problem with the
dependence of phase shifts of ions on their amplitudes.
At the same time there is a necessity in special elements
in storage ring lattices to decrease the slip.

We were forced to decrease the number of ions in the
second example to reach acceptable power of OPA. It can
be increased if the gain of OPA will be decreased. At that
damping time will be increased.

The space resolution of the ion beam and that is why
its ﬁnal dimensions are limited by a value δxres = 3.14
mm, which is larger then the initial beam dimension
σb,0 = 1.1 mm in the example 1.
It does not permit
to reach small equilibrium beam dimensions and means
that we must increase the initial beam dimensions by in-
creasing the dispersion and beta functions in the location
of the pickup undulator or, according to (11), decrease
the length of the undulator and using more short λ1 min
to increase the resolution. High beam size in the pickup
undulator can be arranged by appropriate betatron func-
tion at this place.

Cooling of ion beams is produced in the RF bucket.
In this case the screen must be moved to the position of
the image of the equilibrium orbit and stopped at this
position. Cooling cycles must be repeated periodically.
The length of the URW bunch can be less then ion one.
In this case only overlapped parts of ion and URW beams
will interact. Despite of this all ion beam will be cooled
as ions take part in phase oscillations.

VII. CONCLUSION

We considered EOC of ion beams in LHC storage ring.
Details of EOC for bunched beam will be presented in

a separate paper. The gain of the OPAs can be higher
then considered in the paper. That is why the damping

time is limited by the maximum achievable power of the
OPA and number of kicker undulators.
